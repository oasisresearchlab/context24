The architectural complexity of these units betrays the necessity to impose a tight control on their activity . This is exerted through temporally coordinated and coincident signals which limit the intensity and duration of this activity .

In their travelling through tissues , cells must deal with and adapt to complex and diverse microenvir - onments . Not surprisingly , cells of the same type can use different modes of migration that depend on the physical properties of the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) , the degree of cell - autonomous and non - autonomous proteolysis and on soluble factors [ 1 , 2 ] . The resulting migratory cell plasticity [ 3 ] suggest that the different migratory programs might in fact be based on common or inter - dependent intracellular pathways that govern the switch between modes of cell motility [ 4 ] . Dynamic assembly of actin ﬁlaments is the force gen - erator supporting virtually all the different motility modes [ 5 ] . Genetic and biochemical reconstitution studies have revealed a minimal set of acting binding proteins that critically contribute to accelerate actin turnover to levels observed in vivo in migrating cells [ 6 – 8 ] . Among these are proteins that : ﬁrst , promote the nucleation of actin , such as the Arp2 / 3 complex or formins ; second , affect the depolymerization of ﬁlaments such as the actin - depoly - merizing factor ( ADF / coﬁlin ) family ; third , associate to monomeric actin such as proﬁlin and beta Thymosin ; and fourth , cap the ends of ﬁlaments [ 9 ] . Coordination and integration of the activities of this basic set of proteins is essential to control site - directed actin polymerization in vivo [ 8 ] . However , since the ‘text book’ model for actin dynamics was ﬁrst described by Pollard and Borisy [ 8 ] , our understanding of how protrusion is initiated , maintained and retracted has tremendously increased . It is now clear that multiple actin nucleators are involved in each type of protrusions , and that they frequently collaborate within the same structure to produce new actin ﬁlaments [ 10 ] . It is also obvious that the minimal set of actin regulators are also the convergent nodes of various signalling pathways emanating from diverse extracellular motogenic stimuli [ 5 , 11 ] . Within these pathways , Rho GTPase family members play a key role , acting as molecular switches on which signalling inputs converge and are transduced into a coordinated array of output events regulating site - directed actin dynamics ( for a recent review of these issues [ 5 ] ) . Cells in order to move must also sense and decode spatial information . This is achieved by adapting cytoskeletal core components and activities to local and global mem - brane curvature , composition and dynamics , so as to acquire and maintain an asymmetric architectural distri - bution of cellular structures and signalling molecules whose output , thus , become spatially restricted . Not surprisingly , the molecular mechanisms that allow cells to coordinate the cortical actin cytoskeleton with the membrane to produce dynamics cell shape changes have become the focus of intense investigations ( reviewed in [ 12 – 14 ] ) . These studies are revealing unexpected inter - play between bona ﬁde membrane trafﬁcking and actin regulatory proteins such as the small GTPases of the RAB and RHO family [ 15 , 16 ] . They further point to the importance of a tight interplay between the plasma mem - brane ( PM ) and the underlying cytoskeleton . In fact , molecules capable of sensing PM curvature and compo - sition as well as of deforming lipid bilayers play a crucial role in regulating the dynamics and the architectural Available online at www . sciencedirect . com www . sciencedirect . com Current Opinion in Cell Biology 2013 , 25 : 565 – 573 organization of the actin cytoskeleton , functioning as platforms for the local assembly of actin machinery and decoders of spatial information [ 14 ] . Here , by focussing on the WAVE / Arp2 / 3 actin nucleation machinery driving lamellipodia , as a paradigmatic case , we examine an emerging set of PM - binding and trafﬁcking proteins that act at the membrane : actin interface directly connecting and converging onto this machinery , further revealing the existence of an unexpected ‘endocytic wiring’ that mobilize signalling molecules , ensures polarized com - partmentalization of signals and plasticity in cellular responses . The actin migratory machineries at lamellipodia leading edge Migration of cell crawling on 2D surface is initiated by the extension of lamellipodia that are thin and ﬂat , sheet - like regions that drive and guide cell locomotion exploiting the polymerization of actin ﬁlaments . Pushing is exerted by the addition of monomeric actin between pre - existing plus growing ends of ﬁlaments and the membrane inter - face . Polymerization is activated by nucleation and both branched and linear elongation factors , which are kept restricted to the very leading edge [ 10 ] . Actin polymer - ization triggers also a retrograde ﬂow of the network , which is transduced into different net protrusion rates depending on the degree of the transient linkage of the advancing membrane with the substrate and the cytos - keleton . In addition to branched and linear elongation a number of other activities ( e . g . capping of barbed ends , depolymerization and severing of ﬁlaments by ADF / Coﬁlin ) are also critical to maintain the rate of polymer - ization and rearward ﬂow as well as to impose a relatively stereotypical architectural organization of the actin net - work . In fact , biochemical studies in vitro and high - resolution electron microscopy have forged the so - called dendritic array model [ 17 , 18 ] . Despite some residual controversy as to the density of branches in the network [ 19 (cid:2)(cid:2) , 20 (cid:2) , 21 ] , it is thought that lamellipodia initiation occurs by side branching from ‘mother ﬁlaments’ that are parallel to and abut the PM by the Arp2 / 3 complex [ 22 – 25 ] . This latter complex is inactive and requires the action of the nucleation promoting factors ( NPF ) WAVE , which is kept tightly regulated and spatially restricted by assembly into a ﬁve subunit complex [ 26 – 30 , 31 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] . Fila - ment elongation by VASP and formin is also likely to take place at the lamellipodium tip [ 32 – 34 ] . The balance between branched and linear elongator is thus likely to contribute to the overall architecture of the network , directly controlling the number of branches and length of individual ﬁlament [ 10 ] . Barbed end capping proteins are also crucial for network organization as more capping reduces ﬁlament length and increases rate of nucleation by diverting actin monomer from elongation to nucleation [ 35 ] . The opposite is observed in the absence of capping proteins , leading , as in the case of excessive elongation , to a loose , poorly branched network incapable of sustaining persistent protrusion in 2D [ 36 ] as well as in 3D [ 37 (cid:2) ] ( Figure 1 ) . Networks are maintained also through depo - lymerization and severing by ADF / Coﬁlin of older ﬁla - ments . Finally , behind the highly dynamic lamellipodia , rest a more stable ‘lamella’ composed of parallel array of ﬁlaments , which contribute to migration by coupling the actin network with myosin - II - mediated contractility and substrate adhesion [ 38 ] . How the activity of the WAVE force generator is spatially conﬁned and regulated in lamellipodia ? The WAVE regulatory ( WRC ) and the Arp2 / 3 complexes represent the critical business ends of mesenchymal migratory processes . In addition to being able to initiate branched ﬁlament elongation , these complexes are kept silent until a variety of signalling inputs including direct RAC - binding and phosphorylation converge onto them , inducing their activity [ 26 ] . WRC and Arp2 / 3 complex activity , however , are ﬁnely tuned and spatially conﬁned also by their interaction with the membrane bilayer , either directly by binding to phospholipids or indirectly through association with membrane binding and , surpris - ingly , endocytic proteins . WAVE proteins are part of a multimeric WRC , which comprises ﬁve distinct proteins , SRA1 ( speciﬁcally RAC1 - associated protein 1 ; also known as PIR121 or CYFIP1 ) , NAP1 ( NCK - associated protein 1 ) , ABI1 or 2 ( ABL interactor 1 or 2 ) and HSPC300 [ 26 , 27 , 28 , 29 , 30 , 31 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] . The long sought mode of assembly of the complex has been recently solved through crystallographic studies , revealing that within the complex the catalytic VCA domain of WAVE1 is sequestered into a conserved recess of SRA1 , preventing direct access to Arp2 / 3 [ 31 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] . Com - petitive binding of RAC1 displaces SRA1 from the VCA domain , further promoting the recruitment of WRC to the PM [ 31 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] . The low afﬁnity interaction of RAC1 for the WRC , however , suggests that additional regulatory mech - anisms might also be in place . Consistently , members of the WRC are found phosphorylated at numerous , physio - logically essential sites [ 39 ] . WAVE1 , Tyr125 and Tyr151 , for example , exert control over the release of the VCA [ 31 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] . In fact , phosphomimetic mutations of these tyro - sines generate more numerous lamellipodia , consistent with the WRC being hyperactive [ 31 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] . Post - translational modiﬁcations may also contribute in keeping WRC at bay as suggested by a recent study on Dictyostelium discoideum , where constitutive phosphorylation of serine residues in the acidic domain of WAVE increased WRC auto - inhibition [ 40 ] , implying that phosphatases at leading edges may generate a positive feedback for lamellipodia growth ( Figure 2a ) . Another well - deﬁned activation mechanism of WRC is negatively charged lipids , in particular phosphoinosi - tides [ 41 (cid:2) ] . Mapping of charge distribution over the 566 Cell adhesion and migration Current Opinion in Cell Biology 2013 , 25 : 565 – 573 www . sciencedirect . com surface of the WRC revealed two oppositely charged faces ideally positioned to orient the complex at the membrane [ 31 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] . In keeping with this notion , acidic phospholipids have been proposed to cooperate with RAC1 in recruiting the WRC to the membrane by bind - ing to its positive face . The negatively charged face would , under this arrangement , point away from the membrane , exposing the VCA domain into the cytoplasm where actin nucleation is required ( Figure 2a ) . Thus , direct interaction of WRC with phospho inositol - 3 , 4 , 5 - phosphate [ PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P3 ] [ 42 ] , which are in turn generated by signalling - regulated lipid kinases at the front of migrating cells , may be crucial not only for controlling strength and duration , but also for spatially conﬁning the activity of this NPF . One of the ﬁrst identiﬁed interactor of WAVE proteins is the BAR ( Bin – amphipysin – Rvs167 ) domain containing proteins IRSp53 ( insulin receptor substrate p53 ) [ 43 ] . BAR domain senses membrane curvature and deforms lipid bilayer by binding membrane - rich phospholipids , with a preference for the PM abundant PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 [ 44 ] . Notably , the Inverted - BAR - ( I - BAR ) domain of IRSp53 utilizes a convex , rather than a concave face , to interact with membrane phospholipids , thus sensing negative curvature and driving membrane protrusion [ 45 – 47 ] . IRSp53 also directly links the RHO GTPases RAC1 and CDC42 to actin dynamic regulators [ 48 , 49 ] , including WAVE . Accordingly , IRSp53 is implicated in the for - mation of migratory extensions , and in particular of ﬁlo - podia [ 50 ] , which guide cell migration , epithelial wound Membrane dynamics regulation of actin signalling Bisi et al . 567 Figure 1 EPS8 actin EPS8 is an actin barbed end capping protein , highly expressed in Dendritic cells ( DCs ) Bone marrow - derived dendritic cells from eps8 - / - mice are impaired in 3D chemotactic migration since they fail to extend persistent protrusions due to an altered architectural organization of the actin meshwork ( Frittoli et al Immunity 2011 ) Current Opinion in Cell Biology The actin network architecture in lamellipodia supports protrusion and migration in three dimensions . Electron microscopy , platinum replica of lamellipodia of migratory bone marrow dendritic ( BMDC ) cells derived from WT and eps8 (cid:3) / (cid:3) mice [ 37 (cid:2) ] . EPS8 is an actin capping proteins that is essential for dendritic cell motility and participates in the structural organization of lamellipodia dendritic actin filament network [ 37 (cid:2) ] . Capping proteins work in concert with branch nucleators and elongators . They are thought to increase the rate of nucleation by diverting actin monomers from elongation to nucleation [ 35 ] . Thus , in the absence of EPS8 capping activity the resulting actin network is sparser , resembling the one obtained by excess elongation [ 36 ] and unable to sustaining persistent protrusion in 2D and more relevantly in 3D [ 37 (cid:2) ] . As a consequence eps8 (cid:3) / (cid:3) DC fails to migrate into mice interstitial tissues . The figure was reprinted from : Immunity 2011 Sep 23 ; 35 ( 3 ) .

Biochemically , IRSp53 was shown to enhance WRC activity in reconstituted systems and to promote its recruitment at the lamellipodia leading edge [ 51 ] . These combined features suggest that IRSp53 contributes to activation and localization of the WRC , further linking it to both RAC1 , and possibly CDC42 . In keeping with this notion selective inhibition of IRSp53 binding to RAC1 by KANK , an ankyrin repeat containing protein , impaired lamellipodia formation [ 52 ] . However , IRSp53 knockout ﬁbroblasts while deﬁcient in ﬁlopodia extension [ 53 – 55 ] are fully competent in forming lamellipodia and in migrating in response to growth factor stimulation ( our unpublished observations ) .

( a ) Multiple signalling and membrane - localization inputs converge for the spatiotemporal regulation of WRC in response to motogenic signal . A key event is the activation of RAC that promotes WRC translocation to the PM and displaces autoinhibitory protein : protein interactions that prevent the VCA domain of WAVE to interact with and activate the Arp2 / 3 complex [ 83 ] . RAC , however , is insufficient to fully stimulate the WRC [ 31 (cid:2)(cid:2) , 41 (cid:2) , 66 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] . Phosphorylation of WAVE by still elusive kinases directly participates in both positive and negative modulation of WRC activity . Notably , in Dictyostelium discoideum serine phosphorylation maintain WRC inactive , while tyrosine phosphorylation facilitates VCA release [ 40 ] . Direct binding of WAVE to acidic phospholipids [ PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P3 ] also stabilizes PM localization and act in synergy with RAC binding to activate the complex [ 42 ] . Two membrane trafficking proteins are also implicated in modulation of WRC activity . ARF1 at the plasma membrane provides a temporal coincident signal that cooperates with RAC for WRC activation [ 65 , 66 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] . Clathrin heavy chain may , in some circumstances , regulate the relative distribution of soluble versus membrane - bound WRC [ 71 ] . ( b ) The I - BAR containing IRSp53 protein associates to the WRC [ 43 ] , but it is dispensable for growth factor mediated WRC activation , lamellipodia formation and direction migration . Conversely , IRSp53 may be more relevant during haptotaxis , when cells migrate in response to changes of ECM substrates . IRSp53 , which is a dimer and can form higher order oligomers through its I - BAR domain [ 47 ] , may concatamerize on membranes to spatially organize the WRC complex as well as other actin regulatory proteins . IRSp53 by inducing negative curvature may also promotes downstream of CDC42 filopodia initiation [ 50 ] , a process independent from its ability to bind WAVE ( not shown ) . ( c ) The Arp2 / 3 complex and EXO70 . Of the 8 subunits of the exocyst , EX070 ( and SEC3 ) may sit more peripherally with respect to the core complex and serve as spatial landmarks for polarized secretion and focal exocytosis [ 74 ] . As polarized secretion is emerging as important for directional migration , EXO70 by land marking PIP2 - rich membrane may facilitate the localization of the Arp2 / 3 and promote its kinetic activation by enhancing the interaction with WAVE2 [ 75 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] . As EXO70 interacts also indirectly with RHOGTPases and it is ideally positioned to coordinate membrane and actin dynamics for leading edge extension .

IRSp53 appears , instead , critical for proper cell - ECM adhesion and spreading of epithelial cells [ 58 ] . Similarly , the Arp2 / 3 complex is essential for haptotaxis , which is the ability of a migrating cell to sense ECM gradients on the substrate [ 59 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] ( Figure 2c ) . Thus , IRSp53 - dependent regulation of WRC may be relevant in conferring adaptability and plasticity in response to insoluble environmental cues . Under these conditions , it is possible that IRSp53 may form linear , head - to - tail arrays along the leading edge , exposing its SH3 domains towards the cytoplasm to facilitate WRC recruitment to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P - rich PM and possibly WRC multimerization [ 60 ] . Future studies , how - ever , using genetically modiﬁed mouse model and cells coupled with ultrastructural analysis will be required to validate this possibility . Finally , IRSp53 may also be the actin - membrane linker to a number of other actin reg - ulators , including EPS8 , a capping and bundling protein [ 61 , 62 ] , N - WASP , MENA , and the formin mDia1 [ 49 , 63 ] , which in addition to be implicated in the extension of ﬁlopodia [ 64 ] , may also participate in the architectural organization and dynamics of the lamellipodia network . One unexpected twist in the regulation of the WRC that further betrays our incomplete and simpliﬁed under - standing of the wiring system regulating this complex has been recently unveiled by elegant studies on the importance of ARF GTPases in promoting the activation and recruitment of this complex at the leading edge [ 65 , 66 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] . Using a reconstitution system of lipid - coated beads , Koronakis group established that RAC1 is necess - ary but not sufﬁcient to induce WAVE - dependent actin motility ; another unknown factor was required . Mass spectrometry analysis of the protein platforms recruited to the lipid - coated beads implicated ARF protein as the missing factor [ 65 , 66 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] . Pharmacological inhibitory approaches and protein interaction studies further revealed a direct association between ARF1 and CYFIP and NAP1 [ 65 , 66 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] . More notably , the concomitant pre - sence of RAC1 and ARF1 on beads synergistically enhanced WRC recruitments and activation , indicating that ARF1 not only facilitates PM re - localization , but also participates in triggering WRC conformational changes that leads to its activation ( Figure 2b ) . ARF1 belong to a family of conserved GTPases ( ARF1 – 6 ) that with the exception of ARF6 , are best known for their role in Golgi vesicular transport [ 67 ] . Thus , while the requirement of both ARF1 and RAC1 for full WRC activation can be interpreted as the need of yet another set of temporal coincident signals , it forces to shift our RAC - centric view to integrate regulatory inputs com - monly attributed to trafﬁcking pathways . For example , ARF signalling , like that of all GTPases , is determined by the large family of ARF GEFs , which activate ARFs at speciﬁc cellular locations to produce precise responses [ 67 ] , so it is likely that GEFs will play a signiﬁcant role in determining which ARFs promote WRC activation , and where this occurs , in vivo . Furthermore , the requirement of coincident signalling may revamp studies of GEF and GAPs speciﬁc for either RAC1 or ARF , but that , however have been shown to act in complexes . This is the case of the ARF GEF ARNO that interact with RAC GEF DOCK180 complex [ 68 ] , or the ARF GAP GIT1 inter - acting with the RAC1 GEF b - PIX [ 69 ] . Finally , the fact that ARF proteins are primarily involved in the regula - tion of Golgi trafﬁcking suggests that there maybe an unexpected cross - talk between this process and lamelli - podia extension or that the WRC or some of its com - ponents may not be functionally restricted to control lamellipodia . Some evidence in this latter direction has been provided by showing that unusual protein com - plexes containing CYFIP , but not WAVE and ABI1 coordinate ARF1 and RAC1 actin signalling during clathrin - AP - 1 - coated carrier biogenesis at the trans - Golgi - network [ 70 ] . Another prototypical endocytic protein has appeared among the possible and unusual WRC regulators . The heavy chain of clathrin ( CHC ) was recently reported to interact with the complex and regulate its PM recruit - ment [ 71 ] . Given that CHC is primarily involved in the formation of coats during early steps of endocytosis and that WRC is not found in clathrin - coated pits , it remains , however , unclear what is the relevance of this interaction and its impact on WRC - mediated actin polymerization . Arp2 / 3 and the exocyst The WRC complex is not the only target of prototypical membrane trafﬁcking proteins . A key component of the exocyst , EXO70 , directly interacts with the Arp2 / 3 com - plex [ 72 ] . The exocyst is an octameric protein complex essential for exocytosis and PM remodelling [ 73 , 74 ] . Initial observations indicated that the interaction be - tween EXO70 and Arp2 / 3 was critical for directed cell migration , particularly in response to EGF stimulation , however the underlying molecular and biochemical mechanisms had remained elusive [ 72 ] . Using in vitro actin polymerization assay and time - lapse total internal reﬂection ﬂuorescence microscopy , it became clear that EXO70 could activate kinetically Arp2 / 3 , by binding to the ARPC1 unit and promoting its nucleation and branch - ing [ 75 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] . It was further shown that EXO70 does this by stimulating the interaction between the Arp2 / 3 complex and WAVE2 , suggesting a possible molecular mechanism for the stimulatory effect of EXO70 . Notably , at least in yeast , EXO70 interacts with phospholipids at the PM [ 76 ] . Phospholipid binding and PM localization are con - served in mammalian cells . Thus , EXO70 in addition to Membrane dynamics regulation of actin signalling Bisi et al . 569 www . sciencedirect . com Current Opinion in Cell Biology 2013 , 25 : 565 – 573 targeting the exocyst to restricted PM location and regulate docking of secretory vesicle [ 73 , 74 ] , may also spatially conﬁne Arp2 / 3 complex activity during directed cell migration ( Figure 2c ) . It is worth noting that the interaction of EXO70 and Arp2 / 3 is enhanced by stimu - lation with EGF or activation of the non receptor kinase SRC [ 72 ] , which are potent stimulator of cell migration and lamellipodia protrusions , implying that motogenic signalling pathways orchestrate directional motility by coupling polarized membrane delivery with branched actin polymerization . An important corollary of this pre - diction is that molecules at the interface between exo - cytic trafﬁcking and signalling to actin dynamics may emerge as critical regulators of cell migration . A case in point is represented by the identiﬁcation of SH3BP1 , a RAC1 GAP , as a partner of the exocyst complex [ 77 (cid:2) ] . SH3BP1 was shown to localize together with the exocyst to the leading edge of motile cells and to regulate cell migration via its GAP activity upon RAC1 . In fact , cycles of activation ( by GEF ) and deactivation ( by GAP ) of RAC1 at the leading edge have long been recognized to be necessary for proper morphodynamics of cell pro - trusions and effective cell locomotion . Similar levels of integration between the exocyst and the RHO GTPases , RHOA and CDC42 , may be also exerted through IQGAPs a family of scaffolding proteins with multiple domains [ 78 ] . IQGAP1 indirectly interacts with EXO70 through Sec3 and Sec8 , Exocists components , and func - tions as an effector of both RHOA and CDC42 [ 79 ] . The additional ﬁnding that IQGAP1 promotes through N - WASP the activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex and is endowed with capping activity further suggests the possibility it may contribute in forming the branched actin structures in lamellipodia [ 80 – 82 ] . Thus , inter - actions between secretory ( and more in general trafﬁck - ing ) and actin dynamics multiprotein complexes not only integrate biochemical inputs at the actin : membrane inter - face , but also become means for decoding extracellular cues and transduce spatial information governing cell migratory behaviour . Concluding remarks and perspective Deconvoluting the basic biochemical mechanisms gov - erning the activity of WRC - mediated Arp2 / 3 activation , one of the most fundamental complex for initiation of mesenchymal motility , has proved to be a formidable challenge . Retrospectively , the inherent complexity of the 5 - unit WRC and of the 7 - unit Arp2 / 3 was a loud early warning of the difﬁculties ahead . It is reasonable to assume that such structural complexity may not only have evolved to keep under a strict control an activity that other wise would unleashed a set of unchecked and energy consuming migratory events . Indeed , are the multiple inputs from canonical signalling pathways and much less predictable trafﬁcking routes that shape and orchestrate , in a temporal controlled and spatially polar - ized manner , the activity of these complexes that are built to operate at the membrane : actin interface , where actin polymerization forces are harnessed by cells to adapt and respond to microenvironmental changes . As complex this level of regulation is , it represents only the outer level of a multilayer circuitry where integration between canonical signalling , structural , but dynamic components , and endocytic networks is emerging as the norm rather than the exception . Remarkably , this integrated circuitry not only transduces physiological responses during develop - ments or tissues repair , but is also frequently found dysregulated and high jacked in pathological conditions , including cancer dissemination . Thus , progress in un - derstanding the inner rules of the actin and endocytic signalling matrix will not only help to grasp how cell migration is brought about , but also reveal ways of block - ing or preventing the onset of tumor migratory programs .

Nat Cell Biol 2011 , 13 : 1012 - 1013 author reply 1013 – 1014 . The dendritic nucleation model is based on biochemical and electron microscopy analysis of actin network in lamellipodia . This model had recently been challenged based on the in ability to detect branched actin ﬁlaments in lamellipodia by electron tomography . However , re - visitation of these tomographs conﬁrmed the existence of numerous branches in lamellipodia , reconciling at least in part , a heated controversy . 20 .

J Cell Sci 2012 , 125 : 2775 - 2785 . After disputing the existence of actin branches in lamellipodia , work from this group using an intracellular wounding approach reveals that branches are indeed emanating from mother ﬁlaments for ﬁlopodia initiation , and further link actin ﬁlaments of variable length into subsets that together make up and maintain the ﬁlament network . 21 .
