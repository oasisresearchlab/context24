Binding of transferrin to its receptor ( TFRC , transferrin receptor protein 1 ) initiates endocytic trafficking and subsequent recycling of TFRC to the plasma membrane . RAB8 - positive tubules emanating from the endocytic recycling compartment play an important role in receptor recycling . However , the signaling pathways or mechanisms that mediate formation of RAB8 - positive tubules are not clear . Here , we have investigated the role of transferrin - induced signaling in the regulation of RAB8 - and MICAL - L1 - positive tubules . Addition of transferrin to the serum starved HeLa cells resulted in enhanced recruitment of RAB8 as well as MICAL - L1 to the tubules , which was mediated by TFRC . Dynasore , an inhibitor of dynamin and endocytosis , completely blocked transferrin - induced formation of RAB8 / MICAL - L1 - positive tubules . RAB8 showed strong colocalization with MICAL - L1 on the tubules . Blocking of SRC or AKT kinase activity by specific inhibitors abolished transferrin - induced recruitment of RAB8 and MICAL - L1 to the tubules . Recycling of transferrin receptor was inhibited by blocking of AKT activity . TBC1D17 , a GTPase activating protein for RAB8 , inhibited RAB8 / MICAL - L1 - positive tubule formation . A phospho - mimicking mutant S366D of TBC1D17 did not inhibit formation of RAB8 - positive tubules . Overall , these results show that transferrin induces TFRC mediated signaling dependent on endocytosis that is essential for the formation of RAB8 - and MICAL - L1 - positive tubules involved in recycling of transferrin receptor . Our results also show that AKT regulates transferrin - induced formation of RAB8 - and MICAL - L1 - positive tubules , which might be mediated by phosphorylation of TBC1D17 . Keywords : Transferrin ; transferrin receptor recycling ; RAB8 ; MICAL - L1 ; AKT ; TBC1D17 ; endocytosis . Introduction Endocytosis is an essential cellular process that is required for uptake of nutrients from the extracellular environment and delivery of membrane components ( lipids , proteins and their bound ligands ) to various intracellular locations . Generally , endocytosis is receptor mediated and involves identification of nutrient / signal by the receptor at the plasma membrane , its internalization and release inside the cell [ 1 ] . The receptor can be recycled back to the plasma membrane for further cycles to be performed or transported to lysosomes for degradation . Transferrin ( Tfn ) , a glycoprotein present in the blood plasma , is involved in iron transport from outside the cell through receptor mediated endocytosis [ 2 . 3 ] . Iron - bound transferrin binds to its receptor TFRC ( transferrin receptor protein 1 ) to initiate endocytosis leading to formation of vesicles , which move to the early endosomes [ 4 ] . Iron is released inside the endosomes due to acidic environment and transported to the cytoplasm through transport proteins [ 2 - 5 ] . The transferrin - TFRC complex is recycled back to the plasma membrane from early endosomes ( fast recycling ) or moves to the recycling endosomes . The Tfn - TFRC 3 complex is also recycled to the plasma membrane from the recycling endosomes ( slow recycling ) . Tfn has two receptors TFR1 ( TFRC , gene TFRC ) and TFR2 [ 4 , 6 ] . The TFRC is expressed in almost all the cells . While most of the TFRC is recycled back to the plasma membrane , a small fraction is constitutively degraded in lysosomes through an autophagic pathway that is dependent on RAB12 [ 7 , 8 ] . TFRC degradation in lysosomes also takes place under conditions of iron overload through an unconventional endocytic pathway [ 9 ] . The mechanisms that control recycling of Tfn - TFRC are not completely understood . RAB GTPases control most of the steps of vesicle trafficking pathways including endocytic trafficking and recycling . Several RABs such as RAB4 , 5 , 8 , 11 , 22 and 35 are involved in regulating one or more steps of transferrin trafficking and recycling [ 10 - 15 ] . RAB8 GTPase is involved in mediating Tfn trafficking and recycling from the recycling endosomes [ 14 , 15 ] . It is required for transport of Tfn containing vesicles from early endosomes to the recycling endosomes [ 14 ] . It has been shown to localize to recycling tubular endosomes ( RTEs ) as seen by its colocalization with MICAL - L1 and EHD1 proteins . RTEs are necessary for the delivery of membrane and proteins to the plasma membrane . Activated form of RAB8 ( RAB8 - GTP ) directly interacts with its effector , optineurin ( OPTN ) , which in turn forms a complex with TFRC [ 15 , 16 ] . Activated form of RAB8 is recruited to the tubules originating from the endocytic recycling compartment . Recruitment of RAB8 to these tubules is involved in mediating recycling of TFRC to the plasma membrane . The activity of RAB8 is regulated by a GTPase activating protein ( GAP ) , TBC1D17 , which indirectly interacts with RAB8 through an adaptor protein Optineurin [ 15 ] . In addition to RAB8 , these tubules contain MICAL - L1 and EHD1 proteins [ 17 , 18 ] . MICAL - L1 is required for recycling of TFRC and beta1 integrin [ 17 , 18 ] . The interaction of MICAL - L1 with RAB8 facilitates an indirect interaction between EHD1 and RAB8 [ 18 ] . MICAL - L1 is considered as an effector of RAB8 because it interacts with the activated form of RAB8 . Although the primary function of transferrin is in the process of iron uptake , it is also involved in regulation of cell growth and myelination of axons in the central nervous system [ 3 , 19 - 28 ] . Signal transduction induced by binding of transferrin to its receptor leads to activation of several signaling proteins such as SRC , FYN , AKT , ERK - 1 / ERK - 2 kinases { 3 , 29 - 31 ] . Tfn induced signaling leads to phosphorylation of cortactin and dynamin by the SRC kinase , which gets activated [ 29 , 30 ] . These signaling processes induced by Tfn ( Src kinase activation and phosphorylation of cortactin and dynamin by the SRC kinase ) are required for endocytosis of transferrin [ 30 ] . Phosphorylation of TFRC on tyrosine has been observed under certain conditions [ 32 ] . However , the role of Tfn - induced signaling in the control of Tfn / TFRC trafficking and recycling is not clear . Here , we have examined the role of Tfn - induced signaling in the formation of RAB8 - and MICAL - L1 - positive tubules that are involved in recycling of Tfn / TFRC . Our results show 4 that Tfn treatment of the serum - starved HeLa cells induces formation of RAB8 - and MICAL - L1 - positive tubules dependent on endocytosis . AKT kinase plays an essential role in the formation of these tubules and in the recycling of transferrin . We have also explored the role of TBC1D17 , a RAB8 GTPase activating protein , and its possible phosphorylation by AKT in transferrin - induced formation of the RAB8 - positive tubules .

Generally , 2 - 4 optical sections were projected using LSM510 ( version 3 . 2 ) or the Leica LAS AF software . Images were further processed using Adobe Photoshop for making figures as described earlier [ 15 ] . Analysis of RAB8 - and MICAL - L1 - positive tubules : HeLa cells induced with transferrin or vehicle alone , and cells after transfection with required plasmid or untransfected cells after transferrin / BSA induction were labelled for RAB8 and / or AKT and MICAL - L1 . Images were acquired on Confocal microscope and projected using the software . Cells containing at least one distinct tubule per cell with length greater than 10µm were counted . At least 100 cells in case of induced / untransfected cells , and 40 cells in case of transfected cells were counted for each set of experiment . Treatment of cells : For time course experiments , HeLa cells grown on coverslips were washed and pre - incubated with serum free DMEM for 2hrs . These cells were then incubated with 10µg / ml of unlabelled transferrin in serum free medium for 1hr at 4 0 C . Bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) at a concentration of 10µg / ml in serum free DMEM was used as a control for this experiment . The cells were then shifted to 37 0 C to allow uptake of transferrin for different time intervals ( i . e . 0 , 10 , 15 , 20 , 30min ) . The cells were removed from 37 0 C incubator at the specified time intervals , washed with PBS twice and fixed with 3 . 7 % formaldehyde . Later the cells were labelled for endogenous RAB8 and MICAL - L1 as described . To observe the effect of AKT inhibitor , the cells were serum starved for 2hrs and incubated with 5µM of AKT inhibitor AI4 in dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) along with 10µg / ml of unlabelled transferrin in serum free medium for 1hr at 4 0 C . DMSO at 0 . 05 % and BSA at 10µg / ml were used as controls . The cells were then shifted to 37 0 C to allow uptake of transferrin for 20 minutes .

Results Transferrin induces formation of RAB8 - and MICAL - L1 - positive tubules Tubular structures originating from the endocytic recycling compartment ( ERC ) are involved in the recycling of receptor proteins to the plasma membrane . Activated form of RAB8 preferentially associates with these tubules , which also contain MICAL - L1 and EHD1 proteins [ 14 , 15 , 18 ] . However , the mechanisms that regulate formation of these RAB8 - positive tubules are not clear . Since these RAB8 - positive tubules are involved in mediating Tfn - TFRC recycling , we hypothesized that transferrin - induced signaling may be involved in regulating the formation of these tubules . Therefore , we examined the effect of transferrin 7 ( holo - transferrin ) treatment of the cells on the formation of RAB8 - positive tubules . We carried out this experiment under the conditions frequently used for transferrin uptake assays . HeLa cells were serum starved for 2 hours , incubated with unlabelled transferrin at 4ºC for one hour and then the incubation was continued at 37ºC for 5 - 30 min . The cells were then fixed , stained with RAB8 and MICAL - L1 antibodies , and examined by confocal microscopy ( Fig . 1A ) . Cells treated with bovine serum albumin were used as controls . Treatment of cells with transferrin resulted in a time dependent increase in the number of cells showing RAB8 - positive tubules ( Fig . 1A , B ) . Maximum increase in the percentage of cells showing RAB8 - positive tubules was seen after 20 minutes of treatment with transferrin at 37ºC . Treatment of cells with transferrin also resulted in an increase in the number of cells showing MICAL - L1 - positive tubules ( Fig . 1C ) . Time course of transferrin - induced increase in MICAL - L1 tubules was similar to that of RAB8 tubules ( Fig . 1B , C ) . There was strong colocalization of RAB8 with MICAL - L1 on the tubules ( Fig . 1D ) . The number of cells showing MICAL - L1 - positive tubules was always more than the number of cells showing RAB8 - positive tubules . Almost all the cells showing RAB8 - positive tubules showed MICAL - L1 - positive tubules , but some of the cells showing MICAL - L1 positive tubules did not show RAB8 - positive tubules . Transferrin - induced formation of RAB8 - and MICAL - L1 positive tubules is mediated by transferrin receptor Transferrin receptor TFRC is expressed in almost all the cells . We examined the role of TFRC in transferrin - induced formation of RAB8 and MICAL - L1 tubules by using a monoclonal antibody that is known to prevent binding of transferrin to TFRC . HeLa cells grown on coverslips were serum starved for 2 hours , pretreated with TFRC antibody or control antibody for 30 min at 37 ° C and then incubated with transferrin or BSA ( control ) for 1 hour at 4 ° C . The cells were then shifted to 37 ° C for 20 min . Pretreatment with TFRC antibody resulted in significant reduction in the number of cells showing transferrin - induced formation of RAB8 as well as MICAL - L1 - positive tubules ( Fig . 2A , B , C ) . There was no significant change in the percentage of cells showing basal level of RAB8 or MICAL - L1 positive tubules upon pretreatment with TFRC antibody ( Fig . 2A , B , C ) . These results suggest that transferrin - induced formation of RAB8 and MICAL - L1 positive tubules is mediated by TFRC . Endocytosis is required for transferrin - induced formation of RAB8 and MICAL - L1 - positive tubules Signaling by transmembrane receptors sometimes requires endocytosis of the receptor . Since TFRC is endocytosed readily , we examined the requirement of endocytosis for transferrin - induced formation of RAB8 and MICAL - L1 - positive tubules . For this purpose , we used Dynasore , a small molecule and a potent inhibitor of dynamin GTPase ( and therefore , inhibits dynamin - dependent endocytosis ) that is known to block the uptake , trafficking and intracellular accumulation of transferrin [ 33 ] . Pretreatment of cells with Dynasore reduced transferrin - induced increase in RAB8 and MICAL - L1 - positive tubules ( Fig . 3A , B , C ) 8 whereas basal level of tubule formation was not affected significantly . These results suggest that endocytosis is required for transferrin - induced formation of RAB8 and MICAL - L1 positive tubules . AKT activity is required for the transferrin - induced formation of RAB8 and MICAL - L1 positive tubules AKT is a protein kinase involved in regulating many cellular functions . Activation of AKT has been reported upon treatment of oligodendroglial precursor cells with transferrin [ 3 ] . We examined the role of AKT in transferrin - induced formation of RAB8 - and MICAL - L1 - positive tubules by using a chemical inhibitor and also by using a kinase - dead mutant of AKT . Treatment of cells with AKT inhibitor resulted in complete inhibition of transferrin - induced increase in the number of cells showing MICAL - L1 - positive tubules whereas cells treated with the solvent ( DMSO ) showed transferrin - induced increase in number of cells with MICAL - L1 - positive tubules ( Fig . 4A , B ) . However , there was only a small effect of AKT inhibitor on basal level of MICAL - L1 - positive tubules . Similarly , treatment of cells with AKT inhibitor but not with solvent resulted in complete loss of transferrin - induced formation of RAB8 - positive tubules ( Fig . 4A , C ) . These results show that AKT activity is required for transferrin - induced formation of RAB8 - and MICAL - L1 - positive tubules . To provide further evidence for the role of AKT in transferrin - induced RAB8 - positive tubule formation , we used a kinase - dead mutant of AKT . HeLa cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing kinase - dead AKT and , after 24 hours treated with transferrin . These cells were stained for AKT and MICAL - L1 using specific antibodies and the cells were analyzed by confocal microscopy . Cells expressing kinase - dead AKT showed complete inhibition of transferrin - induced increase in MICAL - L1 - positive tubules ( Fig . 4D , E ) . Even in cells not treated with transferrin , there was some decrease in the number of cells showing MICAL - L1 - positive tubules upon expression of kinase - dead AKT . In similar experiments , expression of kinase - dead AKT resulted in complete inhibition of transferrin - induced increase in the number of cells showing RAB8 - positive tubules ( Fig . 4F , G ) . These results show that AKT mediates transferrin - induced formation of MICAL - L1 - positive and RAB8 - positive tubules . AKT activity is required for transferrin receptor recycling RAB8 - positive tubules are involved in mediating transferrin receptor recycling from the endocytic recycling compartment ( ERC ) to the plasma membrane . Since AKT is required for transferrin - induced RAB8 - positive tubule formation , we examined the role of AKT in transferrin receptor recycling . HeLa cells were transfected with the plasmid expressing kinase - dead AKT and transferrin uptake and recycling assays were carried out by incubating the cells with Alexa546 - labelled transferrin for 20 minutes , and for recycling assay the cells were then washed with complete medium for 45 - minutes at 37 ° C ( chase ) . The cells were fixed either before or after the chase and examined by confocal microscopy . Expression of kinase - dead mutant of AKT resulted in significantly reduced uptake of transferrin as 9 determined by quantitative analysis ( Fig . 5A , B ) . GFP expressing cells were used as control , which did not show any inhibition of transferrin uptake . The level of TFRC was not altered in the cells expressing kinase - dead mutant of AKT , as seen by the western blot ( Fig . 5C ) . After the chase , more labelled transferrin was seen in the cells expressing kinase - dead AKT , as compared with non - expressing cells or GFP expressing cells ( Fig . 5D , E ) . These results suggest that AKT activity is required for transferrin receptor recycling . TBC1D17 inhibits formation of RAB8 - and MICAL - L1 - positive tubules GTPase activating proteins ( GAPs ) with TBC domain regulate the activity of RAB GTPases [ 34 , 35 ] . TBC1D17 is a GAP for RAB8 GTPase . It inhibits some of the RAB8 mediated functions , such as formation of RAB8 - positive tubules and recycling of TFRC [ 15 ] . MICAL - L1 is an effector for RAB8 , which crosslinks RAB8 and EHD1 [ 18 ] . We analyzed the effect of TBC1D17 on MICAL - L1 and RAB8 - positive tubules . HeLa cells were transfected with GFP - TBC1D17 or its catalytically inactive R381A mutant , stained for MICAL - L1 and observed by confocal microscopy . TBC1D17 expressing cells showed a significant reduction in the formation of MICAL - L1 - positive tubules as compared to untransfected cells or control GFP expressing cells or R381A expressing cells ( Fig . 6 A , B ) . These results indicate towards a role of RAB8 in the recruitment of MICAL - L1 on the tubules . We also examined the role of TBC1D17 in RAB8 - positive tubule formation . HeLa cells expressing GFP - TBC1D17 or its catalytically inactive R381A mutant were fixed and stained for RAB8 and observed by confocal microscopy . Expression of TBC1D17 inhibited recruitment of RAB8 on the tubules ( Fig . 7A , B , C ) . However , expression of catalytically inactive R381A mutant of TBC1D17 resulted in a significant increase in the formation of RAB8 - positive tubules ( Fig . 7A , B , C ) . Possible role of phosphorylation of TBC1D17 in the transferrin - induced formation of RAB8 - positive tubules Treatment of cells with transferrin leads to activation of RAB8 , as evidenced by more cells showing RAB8 - positive tubules ; this may be a result of inactivation of its GAP , TBC1D17 . Because AKT is required for transferrin - induced formation of RAB8 - positive tubules , we hypothesized that phosphorylation of TBC1D17 by AKT directly ( or indirectly through some other kinase ) may lead to its inactivation . Therefore , we did a bioinformatics analysis of TBC1D17 protein to look for possible sites of phosphorylation by AKT and other kinases . The consensus sequence for phosphorylation by AKT is RXRXXS / TF / L . One of the sites , S366 ( EQE R RN S 366 L LHGYPRS ) showed a good score , and hence an appropriate site for creating phospho - mimicking mutant by site - directed mutagenesis . S366 is located in the catalytic TBC domain of TBC1D17 ( Fig . 7A ) . TBC1D17 and its phospho - mimicking S366D mutants were expressed in HeLa cells and RAB8 - positive tubules were looked for by confocal microscopy . Unlike wild - type TBC1D17 , the S366D mutant did not show reduction in the percentage of cells showing RAB8 - positive tubules , indicating it to be an inactive form ( Fig . 10 7B , C ) . However , this inactivity was not comparable to R381A - TBC1D17 , which showed increased percentage of cells with RAB8 - positive tubules ( Fig . 7B , C ) . These results suggest that phosphorylation of TBC1D17 at S366 may be one of the mechanisms by which it might get inactivated by AKT . SRC kinase and PI3 - kinase are required for transferrin - induced formation of RAB8 and MICAL - L1 tubules We explored the role of SRC kinase and PI3 - kinase in transferrin - induced formation of RAB8 and MICAL - L1 - positive tubules , because these kinases are known to be activated by transferrin treatment of cells [ 3 , 30 ] . HeLa cells grown on coverslips were serum starved for 2 hours , treated with 10µM of the SRC - inhibitor SU6646 or 250nM of the PI3 - kinase inhibitor , Wortmannin along with 10µg / ml of transferrin or BSA for 1hr at 4°C followed by incubation at 37°C for 20 minutes . Cells were fixed and stained for endogenous RAB8 and MICAL - L1 , and observed by confocal microscope . Representative confocal images are shown in Fig . 8A . Treatment with SRC inhibitor resulted in nearly complete inhibition of transferrin - induced formation of RAB8 and MICAL - L1 - positive tubules ( Fig . 8A , B , C ) . Treatment with PI3 - kinase inhibitor also resulted in reduction of transferrin - induced formation of RAB8 and MICAL - L1 - positive tubules ( Fig . 8A , B , C ) . SRC kinase inhibitor abrogates transferrin - induced AKT activation Treatment of serum starved HeLa cells with transferrin resulted in activation of AKT as seen by phosphorylation of AKT by using a phospho - AKT ( pSer473 ) specific antibody ( Fig . 9A ) . Treatment of cells with SRC family kinase inhibitor SU6656 resulted in abrogation of transferrin induced increase in AKT phosphorylation ( Fig . 9B ) . These results along with results described earlier provide evidence for the hypothesis that transferrin - induced activation of AKT mediated by SRC ( or a SRC family kinase ) is involved in RAB8 tubule formation . Discussion Binding of transferrin to its receptor initiates endocytosis of Tfn - TFRC complex leading to formation of endocytic vesicles , which move to early endosome . Iron is released in the endosomes and Tfn - TFRC complex is recycled back to the plasma membrane or moves to ERC and then recycled back to the plasma membrane . Tubules emanating from the ERC play a crucial role in recycling of TFRC and some other receptors to plasma membrane . Since endocytic trafficking and recycling of Tfn - TFRC is initiated by binding of Tfn to TFRC , we hypothesized that Tfn - induced signaling mediated by TFRC may be involved in regulating the formation of RAB8 and MICAL - L1 - positive tubules . In this study , we have shown that Tfn treatment of cells induces signaling mediated by TFRC , that leads to transient increase in the formation of RAB8 and MICAL - L1 - positive tubules , which requires endocytosis . This 11 transferrin - induced increase in formation of RAB8 and MICAL - L1 - positive tubules is mediated by AKT kinase , as seen by the inhibitory effect of a chemical inhibitor of AKT as well as a kinase dead AKT mutant on transferrin - induced increase in the number of cells showing RAB8 and MICAL - L1 - positive tubules . Our results show that AKT activity is required not only for the formation of RAB8 and MICAL - L1 - positive tubules , but also for endocytic recycling of transferrin . Role of AKT in regulating RAB8 activity through a GAP protein : How does AKT kinase activity regulate the formation of RAB8 - positive tubules ? Only the activated form of RAB8 is present on the tubules and the activity of RAB8 GTPase is negatively regulated by a GAP , TBC1D17 , which also inhibits TFRC recycling [ 15 ] . Bioinformatics analysis showed several potential phosphorylation sites on TBC1D17 and Ser366 was predicted to be a potential site for phosphorylation by AKT ( and some other kinases ) . A phospho - mimicking mutant of this site , S366D was unable to inhibit RAB8 tubule formation in normally growing cells . This indicates that phosphorylation of Ser366 of TBC1D17 by AKT might be involved in negatively regulating GAP activity of TBC1D17 . A catalytically inactive mutant , R381A of TBC1D17 did not inhibit RAB8 or MICAL - L1 - positive tubule formation . In fact , R381A mutant increased the percentage of cells showing RAB8 - positive tubules . This indicates that S366D mutant may not be completely inactive , and phosphorylation at additional sites may be required for full inactivation of TBC1D17 by AKT directly or indirectly . This may be one of the mechanisms by which AKT regulates formation of RAB8 tubules . This is shown schematically in Fig . 10 . Previously , regulation of catalytic activity of GAP proteins by AKT mediated phosphorylation has been reported . Insulin stimulated increase in glucose uptake is mediated by glucose transporter GLUT4 , which is translocated from the storage vesicles to the plasma membrane . This GLUT4 translocation is regulated by AKT mediated phosphorylation of GAP proteins , TBC1D4 ( also known as AS160 ) and TBC1D1 [ 36 - 39 ] . These TBC proteins , TBC1D4 and TBC1D1 regulate several RABs , particularly RAB10 [ 39 ] . Regulation of TBC1D17 by AMPK - dependent phosphorylation has been reported in the control of RAB5 activity and glucose uptake [ 40 ] . Thus , regulation of activity of TBC proteins by phosphorylation is an important mechanism to control the functions of RAB GTPases . What is the function of slow recycling of TFRC ? The main function of transferrin and TFRC in the cells is uptake of iron . Iron is released from transferrin in the early endosomes , from where it is transported into the cytosol by iron transporters . Transferrin - TFRC complex is transported back to plasma membrane through two pathways : fast recycling from early endosomes , and slow recycling from recycling endosomes . What is the purpose of slow recycling of TFRC ? Fast recycling of TFRC should be sufficient for iron uptake . This implies that slow recycling must serve some 12 other function . One possibility is that signal transduction by TFRC , which sometimes requires endocytosis , may require its trafficking to recycling compartment . But it is not clear whether trafficking of TFRC beyond early endosomes is required for signaling function of TFRC . Another possibility is that TFRC delivers membrane to recycling endosomes and autophagosomes . Delivery of membrane from recycling endosomes to autophagosomes for their biogenesis has been shown earlier [ 41 , 42 ] . Recently , it has been shown that autophagy receptor optineurin ( OPTN ) plays a crucial role in the delivery of membrane from TFRC - positive endosomes or recycling endosomes to autophagosomes [ 43 , 44 ] . Whether membrane delivery to autophagosomes occurs from TFRC - positive early endosomes or recycling endosomes ( or both ) is not clear . However , it is interesting to note that a glaucoma - associated mutant M98K - OPTN shows enhanced delivery of TFRC and possibly associated membrane to autophagosomes in retinal cells [ 8 ] . Another mutant of OPTN , E478G , associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , is defective in trafficking of TFRC and possibly associated membrane to autophagosomes [ 43 ] . The relationship between RAB8 and MICAL - L1 - positive tubules : The relationship between RAB8 and MICAL - L1 - positive tubules is somewhat complex [ 18 ] . We observed that the increased formation of RAB8 and MICAL - L1 - positive tubules in response to Tfn treatment follows similar time course . Inhibitors of endocytosis , SRC kinase and AKT kinase showed similar effect on the Tfn - induced formation of RAB8 and MICAL - L1 - positive tubules . Furthermore , RAB8 and MICAL - L1 showed good colocalization on the tubules but not elsewhere in the cells . TBC1D17 , a GAP for RAB8 inhibits formation of RAB8 as well as MICAL - L1 tubules . These results are consistent with the suggestion that activated RAB8 facilitates recruitment of MICAL - L1 on the tubules . However , we noticed that R381A mutant of TBC1D17 enhanced the formation of RAB8 - positive tubules but had no effect on MICAL - L1 - positive tubules . This indicates that there are additional mechanisms for regulating the formation of MICAL - L1 - positive tubules . In conclusion , our results show that binding of transferrin to TFRC induces AKT mediated signaling that regulates formation of RAB8 and MICAL - L1 - positive tubules involved in recycling of transferrin receptor . This signaling is dependent on endocytosis . Close association of MICAL - L1 - positive tubules with the formation of RAB8 - positive tubules under various conditions indicates that activated RAB8 facilitates recruitment of MICAL - L1 to the tubules .

Cell lysates were subjected to western blotting using indicated antibodies . 26 Figure 10 . Schematic showing proposed role of AKT kinase in transferrin - induced formation of RAB8 - positive tubules involved in recycling of TFRC . Binding of transferrin to its receptor TFRC , a transmembrane protein leads to endocytosis . Activation of SRC upon binding of transferrin to its receptor has been reported earlier [ 30 ] . Activated SRC leads to AKT activation , which then inactivates TBC1D17 ( a GAP for RAB8 ) possibly through phosphorylation at S366 . This results in RAB8 activation which is recruited to the tubules . Activated RAB8 facilitates recruitment of MICAL - L1 to the tubules . These tubules mediate recycling of transferrin - TFRC complex to the plasma membrane .
