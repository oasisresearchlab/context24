These puncta have the hallmarks of biomolecular 27 condensates and enable membrane remodeling to drive actin - independent endocytosis . The puncta , 28 which we refer to as endocytic condensates , form and dissolve reversibly in response to changes 29 in temperature and solution conditions . The condensates are organized around dynamic protein - 30 protein interaction networks , which involve interactions among PLDs with high glutamine 31 contents . The endocytic coat protein Sla1 is at the hub of the protein - protein interaction network . 32 Using active rheology , we indirectly characterized the material properties of endocytic 33 2 condensates . These experiments show that endocytic condensates are viscoelastic materials and 34 allow us to estimate the interfacial tension between endocytic condensates and their surroundings . 35 We then adapt the physics of contact mechanics , specifically the contact theory of Hertz , to 36 develop a quantitative framework for describing how interfacial tensions among condensates , the 37 membrane , and the cytosol can deform the plasma membrane to enable actin independent 38 endocytosis . 39 40 3 Introduction 41 Endocytosis in eukaryotic cells can occur via two separate mechanisms . In the budding 42 yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae , membrane invagination that enables endocytosis is normally 43 driven by growth of membrane - bound branched actin ( Carlsson and Bayly 2014 ) . A second actin 44 independent route to endocytosis is realized when intracellular turgor pressure is reduced . This 45 reduction of turgor pressure alleviates the tension on plasma membranes that would normally 46 oppose membrane invagination ( Aghamohammadzadeh and Ayscough 2009 , Basu , Munteanu et 47 al . 2014 ) . In both mechanisms , endocytosis is initiated by the coordinated recruitment of a number 48 of proteins associated with distinct stages of endocytic maturation ( Kaksonen , Toret et al . 2005 ) . 49 Clathrin heavy and light chains first interact with initiator proteins ( Ede1 and Syp1 ) to form a 50 lattice on the membrane . Subsequently , early coat proteins such as Sla1 , Sla2 , Ent1 , Ent2 , and 51 Yap1801 ( Malinovska , Kroschwald et al . 2013 ) bind directly to the adaptor - clathrin lattice and 52 form the cortical body ( Kaksonen , Toret et al . 2005 ) . 53 54 Electron microscopy data highlight the existence of hemispherical membraneless bodies 55 around endocytic sites . These bodies are identifiable by following the localization of labeled 56 endocytic coat proteins such as Sla1 . The observed Sla1 - labeled bodies are known to exclude 57 ribosomes from the cytosol near the cortical sites . Importantly , these endocytic bodies form even 58 when actin is not polymerized and the membrane is flat ( Kukulski , Schorb et al . 2012 ) . Many of 59 the coat proteins in bodies that form around endocytic sites include prion - like domains ( PLDs ) . 60 These domains are intrinsically disordered , low complexity sequences that are enriched in polar 61 amino acids such as glutamine , asparagine , glycine , and serine and are interspersed by aromatic 62 residues such as tyrosine ( Alberti , Halfmann et al . 2009 , Malinovska , Kroschwald et al . 2013 ) . 63 64 Proteins with PLDs have the ability to undergo phase separation in cells ( Alberti , Saha et 65 al . 2018 ) and in vitro ( Martin , Holehouse et al . 2020 ) giving rise to the formation of biomolecular 66 condensates that are mesoscale , non - stoichiometric macromolecular assemblies that concentrate 67 biomolecules ( Bergeron - Sandoval , Safaee et al . 2016 , Banani , Lee et al . 2017 , Powers , Holehouse 68 et al . 2019 ) . Here , we show that endocytosis in S . cerevisiae involves the concentration of PLD - 69 containing proteins – such as the essential protein Sla1 – within biomolecular condensates that 70 form at cortical sites . These condensates are viscoelastic , and they are scaffolded by a dense 71 4 network of PLD - containing proteins . We find that condensate formation requires an intact PLD 72 and that the coat protein Sla1 is at the hub of the condensate driving protein - protein interaction 73 network . The distinctive compositional biases within PLDs of coat proteins contribute to 74 condensate formation and function . We show that the formation of the condensates and 75 cohesiveness of molecular interactions within them , are essential for mechanoactive processes 76 associated with actin - independent endocytosis . We present a model , motivated by the contact 77 theory of Hertz ( Hertz 1881 , Derjaguin , Muller et al . 1975 , Popov , Pohrt et al . 2017 ) , to provide a 78 plausible explanation for how interfacial tensions among condensates , the membrane , and the 79 cytosol , can enable membrane invagination and drive actin - independent endocytosis . 80 81 Results 82 Sla1 - labeled puncta are characterized by temperature - dependent non - covalent interactions . We sought to 83 determine the role of PLD - containing early coat proteins in endocytosis . In the budding yeast S . 84 cerevisiae we investigated actin - independent endocytosis by deleting the gene that codes for 85 glycerol - 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase , a key enzyme of glycerol synthesis , ( GPD1 D ) , ( Basu , 86 Munteanu et al . 2014 ) . Glycerol is the major osmolyte in yeast cells , and glycerol deficiency 87 alleviates turgor pressure and tension on the membrane in GPD1 D cells ( SI Appendix , Fig . S1 A ) . 88 We could then interrogate actin - independent endocytosis in GPD1 D cells by treating them with 89 Latrunculin A ( Lat A ) , an inhibitor of actin polymerization . The concentrations of Lat A that we 90 use in our experiments cause a loss in localization of the filamentous actin marker Abp1 ( SI 91 Appendix , Fig . S1 B - C ) ( Aghamohammadzadeh , Smaczynska - de et al . 2014 ) . We then tracked the 92 formation and internalization of Sla1 - labeled endocytic puncta at cortical sites ( SI Appendix , Fig . 93 S1 D ) . 94 95 Proteins with PLDs and many PLDs themselves undergo reversible , thermoresponsive 96 phase transitions with upper critical solution temperatures ( UCST ) in cells ( Alberti , Saha et al . 97 2018 ) and in vitro ( Martin , Holehouse et al . 2020 ) . Systems characterized by UCST phase behavior 98 will undergo phase separation below a critical temperature T c and transition to one - phase 99 homogeneous regimes above T c ( Ruff , Roberts et al . 2018 ) . The ability of a biomolecular 100 condensate to undergo an abrupt and reversible switch between two phases at a distinct 101 temperature , and do so over multiple heating and cooling cycles , is a defining feature of reversible , 102 5 thermoresponsive phase transitions ( Rayermann , Rayermann et al . 2017 ) . Motivated by published 103 results for PLDs and proteins with PLDs , we assessed whether the Sla1 - labeled endocytic puncta 104 also form and dissolve reversibly in response to increases / decreases to temperature . To investigate 105 such behavior for endocytic puncta , we quantified their sensitivity to multiple cycles of heating 106 and cooling . Sla1 - labeled puncta in GPD1 D cells dissolved and reassembled within seconds as the 107 temperature of the growth medium was cycled between 30˚C and 49°C ( Fig . 1 A - C ) . Quantification 108 of the number of puncta per cell showed a bistable response to increases / decreases in temperature 109 with an apparent transition temperature ( T t ) of 45 . 3°C . Specifically , cells did not contain puncta 110 above T t whereas puncta were observed in cells below T t ( Fig . 1 A , B ) . Importantly , cells remained 111 viable above T t and endocytic function was restored when the temperature dropped below T t ( SI 112 Appendix , Fig . S2 A , B ) . 113 114 Proteins are labile within endocytic condensates . Using super - resolution fluorescence imaging , we 115 quantified the dimensions of Sla1 - labeled bodies to be 209 ± 10 nm long and 118 ± 6 nm wide . 116 These inferences were based on the orientation of puncta in the imaging plane ( Fig . 2 A ) . Our 117 observations for top projections are similar to previous reports of Sla - labeled spherical structures 118 ( Mund , van der Beek et al . 2018 ) . They are also consistent with the electron microscopy data 119 highlighting hemispherical bodies that exclude ribosomes from the cytosol near cortical sites that 120 form in a manner that is independent of actin polymerization ( Kukulski , Schorb et al . 2012 ) . 121 122 To determine whether endocytic condensates have a characteristic mesh size , we measured the 123 diffusivity and permeability of probe molecules within and between condensates and the cytosol and at 124 endocytic sites in cells where condensates were dissolved using 1 , 6 - hexanediol ( HD ) . HD has been shown 125 to dissolve a number of cellular structures , including different types of protein condensates in vivo ( Rog , 126 Köhler et al . 2017 ) and in vitro ( Alberti , Saha et al . 2018 ) . Sla1 - labeled puncta as well as those labeled with 127 all of the PLD - containing proteins that are associated with endocytic puncta , including Sla2 , Ent1 , Ent2 , 128 Yap1801 and Yap1802 dissolve in the presence of HD ( SI Appendix , Fig . S3 A ) ( Updike , Hachey et al . 2011 , 129 Kroschwald , Maharana et al . 2015 ) . However , Syp1 - mCherry , a membrane - bound endocytic initiator 130 containing a scaffold - forming F - BAR domain , was insensitive to HD ( SI Appendix , Fig . S3 B ) . This suggests 131 that membrane targeting of endocytic sites through F - BAR domain oligomerization was unperturbed by 132 HD . We also noted that HD does not disrupt membrane integrity , as monitored by membrane leakage of 133 carboxy - fluorescein ( SI Appendix , Fig . S3 C - E ) . These results imply that HD disrupts endocytic 134 6 condensates and therefore , in cells treated with HD , the diffusivity and permeability of endocytic sites 135 should be identical to those of the surrounding cytosol . 136 137 We quantified the apparent mesh sizes within the endocytic puncta using Fluorescence Recovery 138 After Photobleaching ( FRAP ) and colocalization of FITC - conjugated dextran molecules of 2 . 4 , 5 . 8 and 139 10 . 4 nm dimensions . The dextran probes were osmoporated into cells and FRAP was measured within 140 either Sla1 - or Syp1 - labeled puncta . Maintenance of cell mechanical properties following osmoporation 141 was evaluated by monitoring passive diffusion of expressed viral microNS protein nanoparticles ( SI 142 Appendix , Fig . S7 A - F ) ( da Silva Pedrini , Dupont et al . 2014 ) . Syp1 was used as a reference marker for 143 cortical patches because it was not sensitive to HD at concentrations that dissolved endocytic puncta ( SI 144 Appendix , Fig . S3 B ) . Although the density of the FITC - labelled 5 . 8 nm dextran was lower in Sla1 - labeled 145 puncta than in the surrounding cytosol , the mobility of the 5 . 8 nm probe was equivalent in both regions 146 ( Fig . 2B and SI Appendix , S4 C - F ) . Similarly , the fluorescence intensities of 2 . 4 nm and 5 . 8 nm FITC - 147 labelled dextran recovered equally well in the Sla1 - labeled puncta and cytosolic zones ( Fig . 2 B and SI 148 Appendix , S4 F ) . It is known that weakly charged molecules such as proteins do not encounter hindered 149 diffusion across phase boundaries ( Münchow , Schönfeld et al . 2008 ) . Instead , the key determinants of 150 diffusion of proteins across phase boundaries are the differential affinities to the coexisting phases and the 151 concentration gradients ( Münchow , Schönfeld et al . 2008 ) , and our data are consistent with these 152 expectations . 153 154 In contrast to the transport of 2 . 4 nm and 5 . 8 nm FITC - labelled dextran particles , only a few 10 . 4 155 nm dextran molecules were taken up by the endocytic puncta , although these were mobile in the cytosol 156 ( Fig . 2B ) . Furthermore , when Sla1 - labeled puncta were disrupted by HD , we observed equivalent mobility 157 of 10 . 4 nm FITC - labelled dextran molecules within cortical membrane sites , labelled with HD - resistant 158 protein Syp1 - mCherry , and the neighboring cytosol ( Fig . 2B ) . Our results suggest that endocytic 159 condensates are porous bodies with mesh sizes that are between 5 - 10 nm . These results are consistent with 160 mesh sizes of networks of proteins that engage in non - covalent physical crosslinks in biomolecular 161 condensates , and with electron microscopy data showing that endocytic puncta exclude ribosomes 162 ( Kukulski , Schorb et al . 2012 , Wei , Elbaum - Garfinkle et al . 2017 , Alberti , Saha et al . 2018 ) . 163 164 To measure the exchange of endocytic proteins between condensates and the cytosol , we used 165 FRAP to measure the dynamics of the coat protein Sla2 . To control for dynamic Sla2 recruitment that 166 occurs early in formation of the endocytic puncta , we evaluated fluorescence recovery during periods in 167 which the apparent number of Sla2 molecules in the fluorescent foci of individual puncta was constant . 168 7 FRAP measurements of entirely bleached whole puncta showed signal recovery within seconds and 169 equivalent mobile and immobile fractions ( 0 . 50 ± 0 . 02 ; mean ± sem ) for the protein Sla2 , indicating that 170 mobile fractions of Sla2 proteins are able to exchange with their surroundings on time scales of tens of 171 seconds ( Fig . 2 C ) . 172 173 PLDs are necessary for the formation of functional endocytic condensates . Next , we explored whether 174 endocytic condensates formed by PLD - containing proteins require their PLDs to associate with the 175 condensates and enable actin - independent endocytosis . Since HD generally disrupts interactions among 176 PLD - containing proteins in biomolecular condensates we tested whether dissolution of Sla1 - labeled puncta 177 with HD inhibited both actin - dependent and independent endocytosis in GPD1 D cells as quantified by the 178 uptake of the external fluid - phase ( Measured by Lucifer Yellow ( LY ) uptake ) and membrane components 179 ( Measured by FM4 - 64 uptake ) , respectively ( Fig . 3 A , B ) . Dissolution by HD ( concentration of 5 % wt / v ) 180 led to inhibition of the uptake of membrane components . The HD concentration we used is considerably 181 lower than the concentration necessary to disrupt membrane or Syp1 - labeled cortical patch structures ( Fig . 182 3 B , SI Appendix , S3 B - E ) . Importantly , the inhibitory effect of HD on endocytosis was independent of 183 turgor pressure or actin polymerization ( Fig . 3 A and SI Appendix , Fig . S5 ) . 184 185 Next , we tested the specific importance of PLDs in endocytosis . For this , we tested whether specific 186 PLDs are required for the assembly of endocytic condensates and actin - independent endocytosis . Deletion 187 of the PLDs of Sla1 and Ent1 caused mis - localization of the Sla1 , Ent1 , Ent2 , Yap1801 or Yap1802 proteins 188 and also impaired endocytosis for Sla1 or Ent1 with their PLDs deleted ( Fig . 3 C - D ) . These observations 189 were consistent with previous reports regarding the effects of deletion mutants of Sla1 and Ent1 ( Warren , 190 Andrews et al . 2002 , Mukherjee , Coon et al . 2009 ) . Recruitment of Ent2 , Yap1801 and Yap1802 to 191 endocytic condensates required their PLDs but were not essential to endocytosis , though they may serve 192 other roles in regulating endocytosis . 193 194 The interaction network within endocytic puncta is governed by sequence features of PLDs . 195 Recent studies have shown that multicomponent biomolecular condensates such as stress granules are 196 governed by a core macromolecular network with an uneven distribution of interactions across nodes of the 197 network ( Sanders , Kedersha et al . 2020 , Yang , Mathieu et al . 2020 ) . Such networks are wired by specific 198 types of network motifs or features . The functional importance of Sla1 and Ent1 and their PLDs suggests 199 that they play the roles of scaffolds in organizing endocytic condensates ( Kukulski , Schorb et al . 2012 , Wei , 200 Elbaum - Garfinkle et al . 2017 , Alberti , Saha et al . 2018 ) . To probe the organization of the protein - protein 201 interaction network that underlies endocytic condensates , we performed an in vivo screen for protein - 202 8 protein interactions . Specifically , we used a Protein - fragment Complementation Assay with the reporter 203 protein DiHydroFolate Reductase ( DHFR PCA ) to quantify the effects of PLD deletion on in vivo 204 interactions involving or mediated by Sla1 ( Fig . 4 A ) . Selection for DHFR reconstitution with Sla1 in which 205 the PLD was deleted ( Sla1 D PLD ) revealed the preservation of only two out of the thirteen interactions that 206 were detected with the full length Sla1 . The interactions that were preserved are relevant only to actin - 207 dependent endocytosis ( Fig . 4 B - D ) . These results reveal sequence features of the Sla1 PLD that coordinate 208 the network of interactions and organization of endocytic condensates . 209 210 Glutamine - rich PLDs are required for proteins to partition into endocytic puncta . Given that the PLD of 211 Sla1 is central to coordinating the network of essential protein - protein interactions , we reasoned 212 that determinants of protein partitioning into endocytic condensates and the interactions among 213 them should depend on the amino acid compositions of their PLDs ( Patel , Lee et al . 2015 , Boke , 214 Ruer et al . 2016 , Alberti , Saha et al . 2018 , Wang , Choi et al . 2018 , Vijayakumar , Perrois et al . 215 2019 ) . PLDs have distinctive compositional biases that include ratios of Asn versus Gln and the 216 uniform sequence distribution of aromatic amino acids ( Martin , Holehouse et al . 2020 ) . Alberti et 217 al . , showed that PLDs that drive the formation of amorphous and insoluble amyloid fibrous bodies 218 have a clear preference for Asn over Gln . Conversely , PLDs with higher Gln : Asn ratios form 219 soluble puncta ( Alberti , Halfmann et al . 2009 ) . Sla1 , Sla2 , and the endocytic epsin proteins Ent1 220 and Ent2 have high Gln and Asn contents with a clear preference for Gln . The Gln : Asn ratios in 221 these PLDs are 2 : 1 in Sla1 , ~ 5 : 1 in Sla2 , ~ 3 : 1 in Ent1 , and ~ 4 : 1 in Ent2 , respectively . 222 223 To test if higher Gln content is essential for partitioning into and the material properties of 224 endocytic condensates , we used artificial PLDs to substitute for the native endocytic PLDs . 225 Specifically , we leveraged the work of Halfmann et al . , who compared the prion - forming potential 226 of the NM domain of wildtype Sup35 ( Sup35 NM ) , which includes a PLD , to those of Sup35 in 227 which all NM domain Gln residues are substituted for Asn ( Sup35 NM ( N ) ) or all Asn substituted 228 with Gln ( Sup35 NM ( Q ) ) ( Halfmann , Alberti et al . 2011 ) . The Gln : Asn ratios in these PLDs are 229 ~ 1 . 5 : 1 ( Sup35 NM ) , 1 : 33 ( Sup35 NM ( N ) ) , and 9 : 1 ( Sup35 NM ( Q ) ) . We designed different 230 chimeras of the endocytic epsin proteins Ent1 and Ent2 , in which the cognate PLDs within these 231 proteins were replaced with either that of Sla1 or variants of the non - endocytic protein Sup35 NM 232 domain ( Fig . 5 A ) . Although , the Sla1 PLD shares little sequence identity with either Ent1 or Ent2 233 PLDs ( SI Appendix , Fig . S6 A , B ) , Sla1 PLD chimeras of Ent1 and Ent2 partitioned into endocytic 234 9 condensates ( Fig . 5 B , C and S6 C - G ) . Lowering the Gln : Asn ratio or inverting this in favor of Asn 235 increases the amyloid forming potential of PLDs ( Halfmann , Alberti et al . 2011 ) . We tested 236 additional Ent1 or Ent2 chimeras wherein the cognate PLDs were replaced with Sup35 NM , 237 NM ( N ) or NM ( Q ) . We assessed the effects of these substitutions on the partitioning of chimeras 238 into endocytic condensates ( Fig . 5 A ) . Consistent with the need for a clear asymmetry between the 239 numbers of Gln versus Asn , we observed that only the Sup35 NM ( Q ) chimeras of Ent1 and Ent2 240 partitioned into Sla1 - labeled endocytic condensates ( Fig . 5 E , SI Appendix , S6 F , G ) . Conversely , 241 the Sup35 NM and Sup35 NM ( N ) chimeras did not partition into endocytic condensates ; instead , 242 they formed distinct puncta , indicative of structural features and interaction preferences that are 243 distinct from those of endocytic condensates ( Fig . 5 E , G ) . We further surmised that the fibrillar 244 content of Sla1 labeled puncta must be low ; to test this hypothesis , we measured the staining of 245 Sla1 labeled endocytic condensates using Thioflavin ( ThT ) , which is a marker for amyloid - like 246 aggregates ( SI Appendix , Fig . S6 H , I ) ( Alberti , Saha et al . 2018 , Wang , Choi et al . 2018 ) . These 247 data showed an absence of ThT staining in Sla1 - labeled endocytic condensates or in puncta formed 248 by Sup35 NM ( Q ) ( Halfmann , Alberti et al . 2011 ) . 249 250 Our data show that the compositional features of PLDs , particularly the asymmetry 251 between numbers of Gln versus Asn , are essential for defining the selective partitioning of proteins 252 into endocytic condensates . In addition , the human orthologs of epsins , EPN1 and EPN3 expressed 253 in yeast did not partition into Sla1 - labeled endocytic puncta ( Fig . 5 D and SI Appendix , S6 C - E ) . 254 Among the human chimeric proteins that we generated , only the Sla1 PLD chimera of EPN1 255 partitioned to endocytic puncta , whereas all other chimeras did form independent puncta ( Fig . 5 D , 256 F , G ) . These data point to a clear preference for Gln - rich , non - amyloid forming PLDs derived from 257 yeast , which have different compositional biases than proteins with PLDs from other organisms . 258 It is also worth noting that even if several PLDs share generic physical properties that result in 259 their partitioning into the same biomolecular condensates , each resulting condensate does not have 260 the same material properties ( Wang , Choi et al . 2018 ) . This is important because material 261 properties of endocytic condensates could tune to their mechano - active potentials . Consistent with 262 this view , among all of the PLD chimeras of Ent1 , including those that did partition to endocytic 263 condensates , only the Sla1 chimera supported endocytosis as measured by FM4 - 64 dye uptake in 264 ENT1 ∆ cells ( Fig . 5 H ) . 265 10 266 267 Discussion 268 269 We have presented data to show that endocytic condensates form at cortical sites and these 270 hemispheric bodies require cohesive interactions provided by PLDs within endocytic coat proteins . 271 Endocytic condensates form reversibly , and they are required to drive clathrin - and actin - independent 272 endocytosis . How might condensates contribute to endocytosis in the absence of actin ? Several mechanisms 273 could act in synergy with the formation of the endocytic condensates to drive mechanical invagination of 274 the plasma membrane . These include ( a ) , contributions from membrane curvature - inducing proteins and 275 protein complexes , including convex - shaped BAR ( for Bin , Amphiphysin and Rvs ) domain - containing 276 proteins ( Youn , Friesen et al . 2010 , Yu and Schulten ) , ( b ) insertion of an amphipathic helix into the outer 277 leaflet of the membrane bilayer , which pushes the head groups apart ( Ford , Mills et al . 2002 , Boucrot , Pick 278 et al . 2012 ) , ( c ) modulation of lipid composition ( Graham and Kozlov 2010 , Anitei , Stange et al . 2017 ) , ( d ) 279 local relief of turgor pressure ( Scher - Zagier and Carlsson 2016 ) and ( e ) “steric pressure” exerted at cortical 280 sites due the excluded volumes of proteins that encompass certain categories of disordered domains ( Busch , 281 Houser et al . 2015 , Snead , Hayden et al . 2017 ) . Finally , analogous to condensates formed by synthetic 282 polymers that are known to drive membrane vesicle formation from artificial phospholipid bilayers ( Li , 283 Lipowsky et al . 2011 ) , we postulate that cohesive interactions that contribute to the formation of endocytic 284 condensates also make these condensates mechanoactive by providing the free energy to drive membrane 285 remodeling ( Bergeron - Sandoval and Michnick 2018 ) . 286 287 Of the mechanisms enumerated above , two stand out for the distinctive roles that are 288 ascribed to intrinsically disordered regions ( IDRs ) of proteins , the steric pressure model and our 289 mechanoactive model ( Bergeron - Sandoval and Michnick 2018 , Yuan , Alimohamadi et al . 2020 ) . 290 Stachowiak and coworkers have proposed that IDRs can drive membrane remodeling and 291 endocytosis primarily via excluded volume effects – a phenomenon they refer to as “steric 292 pressure” ( Busch , Houser et al . 2015 ) . Their recent studies also suggest that phase separation of 293 IDRs involved in generating steric pressure also undergo phase separation via depletion - mediated 294 forces ( Yuan , Alimohamadi et al . 2020 ) . Of course , not all IDRs adopt expanded conformations 295 with high excluded volumes ( Das , Ruff et al . 2015 ) . Instead , IDRs come in different flavors ; for 296 instance IDRs such as the PLDs of Sla1 , Sla2 , Ent1 , and Ent2 are deficient in charged or proline 297 11 residues and are characterized by cohesive interactions with one another leading to compact 298 conformations with average radii similar to those of folded proteins ( Ruff , Pappu et al . 2019 ) . 299 Therefore , there appear to be two distinct categories of IDRs that drive membrane invagination 300 namely those that do so via “hard” repulsive interactions afforded by expanded IDRs and a 301 different category of IDRs that drive condensate formation via cohesive interactions , as occurs in 302 our mechanoactive model ( Bergeron - Sandoval and Michnick 2018 ) . This raises the interesting 303 prospect of synergies between the two curvature generation mechanisms by two distinct classes of 304 IDRs . 305 306 We hypothesize that the energy stored with endocytic condensates can be converted into 307 mechanical work to deform the membrane and the cytosol . The mechanics of this process can be 308 described by analogy to a soft viscoelastic and sticky balloon bound to a soft elastic sheet ( Movie 309 S1 ) . A balance between binding and the elastic / surface deformation energies is achieved upon 310 membrane invagination . This idea can be captured in a simple phenomenological model where we 311 express the mean - field energy U stored in a condensate as the sum of mechanical strain energy ( f 312 term ) and work ( y term ) , respectively ( SI Appendix ) : 313 314 𝑈 = 𝜙 ∙ 𝛿 ’ ( ) − 𝜓 ∙ 𝛿 ; ( 1 ) 315 316 Here , U is a mean - field energy , d is the invagination depth of both the membrane and 317 cytosol ( which are coupled by virtue of conservation of volume of the condensate ) and the 318 exponent e > 0 is determined by the deformation geometry ( SI Appendix ) . At equilibrium , ( ∂ U / ∂ d ) 319 = 0 , and we expect invagination to balance the two contributions such that the value of d * that 320 minimizes the mean - field energy ( 1 ) is computed as , 321 322 𝛿 ∗ = 1 𝜓 𝜙 ( 1 + 𝜀 ) 4 ’ ) ; ( 2 ) 323 324 Equation ( 2 ) shows that the invagination depth d is determined by the ratio y / f and the 325 deformation geometry that is captured in the exponent ε . The numerical values of f and y can be 326 12 estimated from the dimensions of the condensates as well as the viscoelastic properties of the 327 cytosol , the condensate , and the membrane , respectively ( SI Appendix ) . 328 329 To test whether the endocytic condensates have viscoelastic properties that are required to 330 drive membrane invagination we used active rheology to measure the material properties of the 331 cytosol in which endocytic condensates are embedded . Since the endocytic condensates are too 332 small to probe their material properties directly , we inferred their material properties using the 333 contact theory of Hertz ( Hertz 1882 ) . This theory relates the elastic moduli of elastic materials in 334 contact with one another through the resulting geometries of their contacting surfaces . We probed 335 the material properties of the yeast cytoplasm with optical tweezers to measure the frequency - 336 dependent amplitude and phase responses of 200 nm diameter polystyrene beads that are 337 embedded in cells ( Fig . 6 , SI Appendix , Fig . S7 G , H ) . We used an acousto - optic device to oscillate 338 the position of the optical trap in the specimen plane at frequencies that spanned over four orders 339 of magnitude and measured the displacement of trapped beads from the trap center using back 340 focal plane interferometry ( Fig . 6 A - C ) . We quantified the viscoelastic properties of the cytosol 341 surrounding the beads by measuring the phase and amplitude of displacements of beads in response 342 to oscillations of the optical tweezers and calculated the power spectrum of unforced fluctuations 343 of the bead to obtain storage ( G ¢ ) and loss ( G ² ) moduli as a function of frequency ( Fig . 6 B , C and 344 SI Appendix ) ( Hendricks and Goldman 2017 ) . We used both the dimensions and time - lapse 345 fluorescence imaging of Sla1 - labeled puncta to determine that endocytic condensates expand at a 346 rate of 2360 ± 120 nm s - 1 ( SI Appendix , Fig . S7 I , J ) , corresponding to a stress at ~ 30 ± 2 Hz . At 347 this timescale , the cytosol is principally elastic with a shear modulus of approximately 20 Pa ( Fig . 348 6 C ) . We also measured the linear displacement of Sla1 - labeled puncta within the confocal volume 349 as a function of time . Membrane invagination occurs at a velocity of 7 . 4 ± 2 . 5 nm s - 1 , and this 350 corresponds to a frequency of 0 . 1 ± 0 . 04 Hz ( SI Appendix , Fig . S7 I , J ) . In this regime , the 351 cytoplasm is viscoelastic and mechanically compliant ( Fig . 6 C ) . The G ¢ and G ² values we 352 measured here are similar to those of the cytoplasm of adherent mammalian cells ( Hendricks , 353 Holzbaur et al . 2012 , Guo , Ehrlicher et al . 2013 , Guo , Ehrlicher et al . 2014 ) . 354 Based on the parameters obtained from active rheology including the dynamic modulus of the 355 cytoplasm , we were able to determine the material properties of endocytic condensates embedded in the 356 cytoplasm using Hertz theory and measurements of the dimensions of condensates that we determined by 357 13 super - resolution microscopy ( Fig . 2 A ) ( Hertz 1882 ) . We used this information to estimate the apparent 358 Young’s modulus of endocytic condensates to be 59 Pa , which is on the same order as that of the cytosol 359 at 45 Pa at 1 Hz ( Fig . 6 C , and SI Appendix , Extended Materials and Methods ; Eq . 3 . 7 - 3 . 10 ) . These results 360 are consistent with those obtained for other protein - based elastic materials ( Reichheld , Muiznieks et al . 361 2017 ) . 362 363 The Young - Laplace equation yields an estimate of γ dc = 7 ´ 10 - 5 N•m - 1 for the interfacial 364 tension at the condensate - cytosol interface . This estimate is based on the pressure difference across 365 the cytosolic interface and the mean curvature of the condensate ( SI Appendix , Extended Materials 366 and Methods ; Eq . 4 . 6 ) . It falls within the range of values that have been reported for other protein 367 condensates , including nucleoli and P granules ( SI Appendix , Extended Materials and Methods ; 368 Eq . 4 . 9 ) ( Brangwynne , Mitchison et al . 2011 , Elbaum - Garfinkle , Kim et al . 2015 ) . 369 370 Using the inferred apparent elastic modulus for the endocytic condensate , we computed the 371 mechanical strain ( f ) and mechanical work ( y ) , respectively as functions of membrane and cytosol 372 invagination δ ( Fig . 7 A , SI Appendix , S8 and Extended Materials and Methods ; Eq . 4 . 25 , 4 . 26 ) . 373 Our physical framework suggests that the formation of endocytic condensates generates 4 . 9 ´ 10 - 374 18 J ( Fig . 7 A and Table S 4 ) , which is within the range of the energy required to provide the 375 necessary membrane invagination . Rheology experiments also yield estimates for the energy of 376 deformation that are strikingly similar . This points to a clear route for force generation by 377 condensates that enables membrane invagination , thereby activating membrane constriction and 378 vesicle scission to drive actin - independent endocytosis ( Idrissi , Blasco et al . 2012 ) . 379 A mechanical analogy can aid in understanding our model ( Fig . 7 B , SI Appendix , Movie 380 S1 ) . Adhesion of the endocytic condensate to the cytosol tends to drive the condensate to maximize 381 the contact surface area between the condensate and the cytosol . Because the condensate is a 382 viscoelastic material , its volume must remain constant . The area of the condensate - cytosol 383 interface is proportional to the square of the radius . Any increase in interfacial area must be 384 compensated by a decrease in volume of the condensate , which varies by the cube of the radius of 385 the condensate . Since the drive to increase the condensate - cytosol contact is symmetrical , the only 386 way that the condensate volume can be reduced , is by invagination of the membrane . This , 387 however , increases the favorable condensate - membrane surface contact , thus acting as a positive 388 14 feedback to further drive membrane invagination . The system comes to equilibrium when the 389 viscoelastic properties of the condensate and cytosol prevent further expansion and invagination . 390 This is the point at which scission of a mature endocytic vesicle must occur . 391 There remains the question of how the geometry of the observed membrane invagination comes 392 about . Evidence from electron and super - resolution fluorescence microscopy indicates that the 393 favored geometry of the membrane is flat with invagination centered in the middle of the endocytic 394 condensate . Such geometries can be explained by a local radial stress gradient generated by 395 adhesion of the viscoelastic condensate to the membrane on one side and the cytosol or the other 396 ( Korchagin , Dolbow et al . 2007 ) . Local radial stress gradients can also be generated by 397 asymmetries in local binding of adaptor proteins , or by distinct lipid compositions . Overall , our 398 model and the questions they raise provide the motivation for continued investigation of the details 399 of regulation of endocytosis in eukaryotic cells . Our model also provides motivation for 400 investigating the mechano - active roles of viscoelastic condensates that contribute to vesicle 401 trafficking processes and involve proteins with PLDs ( Pietrosemoli , Pancsa et al . 2013 ) . 402 15 Acknowledgements 403 The authors acknowledge support from CIHR grants MOP - GMX - 152556 ( SWM ) , the US 404 National Institutes of Health grant R01NS056114 ( RVP ) , the Fonds Québécois de la Recherche 405 sur la Nature et les Technologies ( SWM and PF ) , the US National Science Foundation through 406 grant MCB - 1614766 ( RVP ) , NSERC RGPIN / 05843 - 2014 ( AJE ) , CIHR 143327 ( AJE ) , CFI 407 32749 ( AJE and AGH ) , and the Human Frontier Science Program RGP0034 / 2017 ( SWM and 408 RVP ) .
