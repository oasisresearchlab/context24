passive 5mC depletion ( fig . S23 ) ( 18 ) , which may contribute to the partial demethylation observed in Tet1 and Tet2 knockdown PGCLCs . Thus , where - as in zygotes 5mC reprogramming is mechanis - tically compartmentalized into TET3 - mediated 5hmC conversion of the paternal genome and di - rect passive 5mC depletion on the maternal ge - nome ( 12 , 19 – 21 ) , both of these mechanisms operate together in PGCs ( Fig . 4B ) . In addition , up - regulation of the base excision repair ( BER ) pathway in PGCs may both protect against cu - mulative genetic damage and act as an auxiliary active demethylation mechanism , perhaps for specific loci ( 22 , 23 ) . Reprogramming in PGCs thereforeinvolvesmultipleredundantmechanismstoresettheepigenomefortotipotency , which ac - counts for the apparent fertility ( albeit subfertile ) of mice lacking individual components , such as Tet1 ( 24 ) . The existence of multiple mechanisms may also underpin the comprehensive nature of DNA demethylation in PGCs ( 3 ) . Nonetheless , some rare single - copy sites of CpG methylation escape from 5mC erasure ( 25 ) , which may pro - vide mechanistic avenues for investigations into transgenerational epigenetic inheritance .

We used stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy to study the organization of actin , spectrin , and associated proteins in neurons . Actin formed ringlike structures that wrapped around the circumference of axons and were evenly spaced along axonal shafts with a periodicity of ~ 180 to 190 nanometers . This periodic structure was not observed in dendrites , which instead contained long actin filaments running along dendritic shafts . Adducin , an actin - capping protein , colocalized with the actin rings . Spectrin exhibited periodic structures alternating with those of actin and adducin , and the distance between adjacent actin - adducin rings was comparable to the length of a spectrin tetramer . Sodium channels in axons were distributed in a periodic pattern coordinated with the underlying actin - spectrin – based cytoskeleton . A ctin plays critical roles in shaping and maintaining cell morphology , as well as in supporting various cellular functions , including cell motility , cell division , and intra - cellular transport ( 1 ) . In neurons , actin is essen - tial for the establishment of neuronal polarity , cargo transport , neurite growth , and stabilization of synaptic structures ( 2 – 4 ) . Despite its impor - tance , our understanding of actin structures in neurons remains incomplete . Electron micros - copy has shown detailed actin ultrastructure in growth cones and dendritic spines ( 5 , 6 ) , in which actin is the dominant cytoskeletal protein , but little is known about the organization of actin in the axonal and dendritic shafts ( 4 ) . These neurites contain a high density of different types of cytoskeletal filaments , such as microtubules and neurofilaments ( 6 – 8 ) . Hence , the challenge of resolving the organization of actin in axons and dendrites requires imaging tools with both high spatial resolution and molecular specificity . A prototypical actin - spectrin – based cytoskel - eton structure is found in red blood cells ( erythro - cytes ) ( 9 , 10 ) , where actin , spectrin , and associated proteins form a two - dimensional ( 2D ) polygonal network ( mostly composed of hexagons and pentagons ) underneath the erythrocyte mem - brane ( 11 , 12 ) . Spectrin analogs have been found in many other animal cells ( 9 , 10 ) , including neurons ( 13 , 14 ) . These analogs play important roles , ranging from regulation of the heartbeat to stabilization of axons , formation of axon ini - tial segments and nodes of Ranvier , and stabi - lization of synapses in neurons ( 9 , 10 , 15 ) . An erythrocyte - like , polygonal lattice structure has been observed for spectrin in the Drosophila neuromuscular junction ( 16 ) , and models similar to the erythrocyte cytoskeleton have also been proposed for other systems ( 10 ) . However , the ultrastructural organization of spectrin in non - erythrocyte cells is largely unknown due to sim - ilar challenges in imaging . Recent advances in superresolution fluores - cence microscopy ( 17 , 18 ) allow resolutions down to ~ 10 nm to be achieved with molecular spec - ificity , providing a promising solution to the above challenges . In particular , superresolution studies of neurons have provided valuable struc - tural and dynamic information of actin in den - dritic spines ( 19 – 22 ) . In this work , we used a superresolution fluorescence imaging method , stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy ( STORM ) ( 23 – 27 ) , to study the 3D ultrastructural organization of actin and spectrin in neurons . To image actin in neurons , we fixed cultured rat hippocampal neurons at various days in vitro ( DIV ) and labeled actin filaments with phalloi - din conjugated to a photoswitchable dye , Alexa Fluor 647 ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) ( Fig . 1 ) ( 28 ) . To identify axons and dendrites , we immuno - labeled MAP2 , a microtubule - associated protein enriched in dendrites , or NrCAM , a cell adhe - sion molecule found in the initial segments of axons ( 15 ) , using a dye of a different color ( Fig . 1 ) ( 28 ) . In the conventional fluorescence images ( Fig . 1 , A , D , and F ) , MAP2 specifically stained dendrites , and NrCAM specifically la - beled the initial segments of axons , whereas actin was found in both dendrites and axons . Next , we used 3D STORM ( 27 ) with a dual - objective astigmatism - imaging scheme ( 28 , 29 ) 1 Howard Hughes Medical Institute ( HHMI ) , Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology , Harvard University , Cam - bridge , MA 02138 , USA . 2 Department of Physics , Harvard University , Cambridge , MA 02138 , USA . * These authors contributed equally to this work . † To whom correspondence should be addressed .

Only a sparse subset of the labeled Alexa 647 molecules were activated with 405 - nm light at any instant and imaged with 647 - nm light using a continuous illumination and detection mode ( 30 ) . The xy and z coordinates of the activated molecules were de - termined from the centroid positions and elliptic - ity values of their images , respectively ( 27 , 29 ) . Iterating this procedure allowed numerous mole - cules to be localized and a 3D superresolution image to be constructed from the coordinates of these molecules . In contrast to the conventional images , indi - vidual actin filaments were resolved in the STORM images ( Fig . 1 , B , C , E , and G , and fig . S1B ) ( 28 ) . We observed long actin filaments in den - drites ( Fig . 1 , B and C , and fig . S1B ) . These filaments were primarily distributed within a cor - tical layer beneath the plasma membrane and largely ran along the long axes of dendrites , though crossing filaments were also observed ( Fig . 1 , B and C ) . Our findings here were fo - cused on dendritic shafts and do not exclude the possibility of different actin organizations in den - dritic spines ( 3 , 6 ) . In contrast , we observed a drastically differ - ent organization of actin in axons . Actin fila - ments appeared to be arranged into isolated rings that wrapped around the circumference of the axons ( Fig . 1 , E and G ) . These rings were pe - riodically distributed along the axonal shafts , forming a ladderlike , quasi - 1D lattice with a long - range order ( Fig . 1 , E and G ) . Examination of neurons at different developmental stages showed that the periodic actin pattern started to appear at ~ 5 DIV , became clearly visible at ~ 7 DIV ( fig . S2 ) ( 28 ) , and was maintained in older ma - ture neurons ( e . g . , 28 DIV ) ( fig . S3 ) ( 28 ) . In mature neurons , more than 80 % of the neuronal processes that could be identified as axon shafts ( that is , neurites positive for NrCAM or those devoid of MAP2 and wider than 50 nm ) exhib - ited the periodic , ladderlike actin pattern , whereas some filopodia - like processes branching from axon shafts did not ( fig . S3 ) . Although long actin filaments were also observed along some axons , especially in thicker axons ( Fig . 1 , E and G , and figs . S2E and S3B ) , the periodic , ringlike pattern was the most pronounced actin feature in the axon shafts . We found similar periodic patterns in both the initial segments of axons ( Fig . 1G ) and distal axons that were not close to the cell body ( figs . S1B and S3 ) . The periodicity of the actin pattern in axons appeared highly regular ( Fig . 2 ) . Projection of the 3D images of actin to the long axis of the axon led to well - separated peaks with nearly identical spacing ( Fig . 2A ) . A Fourier transform of the 1D projection yielded fundamental fre - quencies and overtones corresponding to a spatial period of ~ 190 nm ( Fig . 2B ) . Statistical analysis of the spacings showed a narrow dis - tribution with a mean value of 182 nm and a SD of 16 nm ( Fig . 2C ) . The quasi - 1D , periodic actin structure prompted us to search for a molecular mechanism underly - ing this organization . In particular , the isolated actin ringlike structures with ~ 180 - to 190 - nm spacing did not appear to form a cohesive net - work by themselves . Thus , we reasoned that a linker component may be present to connect the actin structures into a network , thereby giving mechanical support to the membrane , and to provide a mechanism for the regular spacing between the actin rings . We hypothesized that spectrin could be a good candidate for this linker component . The rod - shaped spectrin tetramers , typically 150 to 250 nm in length , cross - link short actin filaments in the erythrocyte membrane cytoskeleton to form a 2D , polygonal network ( 9 – 12 ) . Spectrin analogs , in particular a II - b II spectrin , are present in the mammalian brain ( 10 , 13 , 14 ) . Moreover , brain spectrin interacts with actin , and spectrin tetramers isolated from the brain exhibit a rodlike shape , with an av - erage length of 195 nm ( 14 ) , comparable to the spatial periodicity we observed for the actin rings . To test this hypothesis , we performed 3D STORM imaging of b II - spectrin , which is en - riched in distal axons ( 31 ) . We immunolabeled b II - spectrin with the use of an antibody ( 28 ) that specifically targeted the C terminus of b II - spectrin , which should label the center of the rodlike a II - b II spectrin tetramer ( 9 , 10 ) . If the adjacent actin rings are connected by spectrin tetramers , we ex - pect the centers of the spectrin tetramers to also form a periodic pattern of ringlike structures with a quantitatively similar periodicity . We observed highly periodic , ringlike structures for the C ter - minus of b II - spectrin in axons ( Fig . 3A and Fig . 1 .

S4 and S5 ) but not in dendrites ( fig . S5 ) ( 28 ) . Statistics of the spacings between adjacent rings gave a mean value of 182 nm and a SD of 18 nm ( Fig . 3B ) , which are nearly identical to the values measured for the actin rings ( Fig . 2C ) , suggesting that spectrin and actin may form a coordinated periodic network . b IV - spectrin , a spectrin subtype specifically located in the axon initial segment ( fig . S6 ) ( 15 , 28 , 32 ) , also ex - hibited a quasi - 1D , periodic pattern ( Fig . 3 , C and D ) similar to those of actin and b II - spectrin , consistent with the observation that the period - ic actin structure was detected in both axon ini - tial segments ( Fig . 1G ) and distal axons ( figs . S1B and S3 ) . In the erythrocyte cytoskeleton , the network formed by short actin filaments ( 12 to 16 mono - mers ) and spectrin tetramers contains other pro - teins , such as adducin ( a protein that caps the growing end of actin filaments and promotes the binding of spectrin to actin ) and ankyrin ( a protein that helps to anchor spectrin to the mem - brane ) ( 9 , 10 ) . Thus , we also probed the distribu - tions of these molecules in axons . Immunolabeled adducin formed periodic , ladderlike structures in axons ( Fig . 3E ) , with a periodicity quantita - tively similar to those of the actin and spectrin structures ( Fig . 3F ) . Immunolabeled ankyrin - B exhibited a semiperiodic pattern with a sim - ilar periodicity but a less regular distribution compared with those observed for actin , spectrin , and adducin ( fig . S7 ) ( 28 ) . The less regular dis - tribution is expected for ankyrin - B because each spectrin tetramer contains two separate ankyrin - binding sites that are both away from the center of the spectrin tetramer , neither of which is nec - essarily occupied by ankyrin ( 9 , 10 ) . To confirm that the periodic actin - spectrin structure exists in the brain , we performed STORM imaging of hippocampal tissue slices of adult mice ( fig . S8 ) ( 28 ) . Because axons , dendrites , and cell bodies are densely packed in all three dimensions in brain tissues , we needed a pos - itive marker to unambiguously identify axons in these experiments . We used b IV - spectrin , which is specifically localized to the initial segments of axons ( fig . S6 ) ( 15 , 28 , 32 ) , as such a marker . We performed STORM imaging on either im - munolabeled b IV - spectrin or phalloidin - labeled actin . We observed quasi - 1D , periodic structures for both b IV - spectrin ( fig . S8 , A and B ) and actin ( fig . S8 , G and I ) in axon segments stained by b IV - spectrin , with periodicities quantitatively sim - ilar to those observed in cultured neurons ( fig . S8 , C to E and J to L ) . Next , we performed two - color STORM im - aging of cultured neurons to determine the relative positions of the molecular components observed in the quasi - 1D , periodic axonal cytoskeleton ( Fig . 4 ) . To this end , we labeled actin and spectrin ( or adducin ) with spectrally distinct photoswitch - able dyes ( 28 ) . We detected highly regular , alter - nating patterns of actin and spectrin in axons with the spectrin stripes falling midway between ad - jacent actin stripes ( Fig . 4A and fig . S9A ) ( 28 ) .

Treatment with an actin - depolymerizing drug , latrunculin A , not only eliminated the pe - riodic actin structures , but also disrupted the periodic structures of spectrin ( fig . S10 ) ( 28 ) , sug - gesting that the actin and spectrin structures are interconnected . The adducin stripes , on the other hand , ap - peared to colocalize with the actin stripes ( Fig . 4B and fig . S9B ) ( 28 ) . Given that adducin caps one end of actin filaments , this result suggests that the ringlike actin structures probably do not represent long , continuous filaments spanning the entire ring , but rather are made of capped , short filaments aligned along the circumferential di - rection of the axon , probably facilitated by actin - binding or – cross - linking proteins ( 2 , 3 ) . As described earlier , long actin filaments running along axons were sometimes observed , but the filaments did not appear to have a well - defined spatial relation with either spectrin or adducin ( fig . S9A and B ) . Consistent with the above results , b II - spectrin ( C terminus ) and adducin stripes also alternated with each other along the axon ( Fig . 4C and fig . S9C ) ( 28 ) . To further analyze the data quantitatively , we calculated the cross - correlation between the two color channels for each of the three combinations : actin / spectrin , actin / adducin , and spectrin / adducin ( Fig . 4E ) . The cross - correlation was determined for the 1D localization distri - butions , as shown in fig . S9 ( 28 ) . The ~ 180 - to 190 - nm periodicities were apparent for all three correlationfunctions ( Fig . 4E ) . The actin - adducin pair appeared to be correlated , exhibiting a max - imum near zero shift , indicating that actin and adducin colocalize with each other . The actin - spectrin ( C terminus of b II - spectrin ) and adducin - spectrin ( C terminus of b II - spectrin ) pairs were both anticorrelated , exhibiting a minimum at zero shift and maxima at ~ 90 - to 100 - nm shifts , indi - cating that the centers of the spectrin tetramers lie halfway between the adjacent actin - adducin rings . Finally , to assess the possible functional im - plication of this quasi - 1D , periodic cytoskeletal structure , we performed two - color imaging of b IV - spectrin and sodium channels ( Na v ) in the axon initial segments ( 28 ) . Sodium channels are enriched in the axon initial segments and are important for the generation of action potentials ( 15 , 33 ) . We immunostained the N - terminal re - gion of b IV - spectrin , which is at the two ends of the spectrin tetramer . Interestingly , Na v and the N terminus of b IV - spectrin exhibited alternating periodic patterns , with Na v being most abundant approximately halfway between the ends of the spectrin tetramers ( Fig . 4 , D and E , and fig . S9D ) ( 28 ) . Thus , the periodic distribution of Na v is most likely coordinated by the underlying pe - riodic cytoskeleton structure , presumably through ankyrin - G ( 34 ) , which interacts with both sodium channels and b IV - spectrin ( 9 , 15 , 35 , 36 ) . The periodic pattern of Na v appeared less regular than that of b IV - spectrin , potentially because each spectrin tetramer contains two separate Na v binding sites ( through ankyrin - G ) that are not fully occupied , or because not every Na v mole - cule is anchored to the underlying cytoskeleton . It is also possible that the antibody against Na v was less specific . The above results suggest that the cortical cytoskeleton of axons is composed of short actin filaments that are capped by adducin at one end and arranged into ringlike structures , which wrap around the circumference of the axon ( Fig . 4F ) . Spectrin tetramers connect the neighboring actin / adducin rings along the long axis of the axon , tightly regulating the periodicity of the cytoskeleton structure to ~ 180 to 190 nm and Fig . 4 . Actin , spectrin , and adducin form a co - ordinated , quasi - 1D lat - tice structure in axons , and sodium channels are distributed in a periodic pattern in coordination with the actin - spectrin – based submembrane cy - toskeleton .

The correlation func - tion is calculated for varying relative shifts between the two color channels along the axons . ( F ) A model for the cortical cytoskeleton in axons . Short actin filaments ( green ) , capped by adducin ( blue ) at one end , form ringlike structures wrapping around the circumference of the axon .

The letters “ C ” and “ N ” denote the C terminus ( magenta triangles ) and N terminus ( magenta squares ) of b - spectrin , respectively . Ankyrin and sodium channels , not shown in the model , also form semiperiodic patterns in coordination with the periodic cytoskeletal structure . www . sciencemag . org SCIENCE VOL 339 25 JANUARY 2013 455 REPORTS giving the axonal cytoskeleton a long - range order . Despite the molecular composition dif - ferences between the axon initial segments and distal axons [ for example , ankyrin - G and b IV - spectrin are confined in the axon initial segment by an exclusion effect of the distal axon proteins ankyrin - B and b II - spectrin ( 31 ) ] , the cytoskel - etal organization is similar between the initial and distal segments of the axons , both adopting a quasi - 1D , periodic structure . Interestingly , we found this periodic cytoskeleton structure to be present only in axons , not in dendrites , which instead primarily contained long actin filaments running along the dendritic axis . Although the microscopic interactions between the molecu - lar components of the axon cytoskeleton are probably similar to those between the erythro - cyte analogs ( 9 , 10 ) , the overall structure of this quasi - 1D , periodic cytoskeleton in axons is distinct from the 2D , pentagonal or hexagonal structure observed for the erythrocyte membrane cytoskeleton ( 11 , 12 ) . In Drosophila motoneuron axons near the neuromuscular junctions , spectrin and ankyrin appear to organize into an erythrocyte - like , pentagonal or hexagonal lattice structure ( 16 ) , which is distinct from the quasi - 1D , periodic , lad - derlike structure that we observed in the axons of vertebrate brains . Whether the difference is due to invertebrate versus vertebrate animals or pe - ripheral versus central nervous systems is a topic for future investigations . The periodic , actin - spectrin – based cytoskel - eton observed here may not be involved in myosin - dependent axonal transport . If the analogy to the erythrocyte membrane cytoskeleton holds , the capped short actin filaments in the ringlike actin structures in axons are probably bound by tropo - myosin ( 9 , 10 ) , which could potentially prevent the binding of myosins . Myosin - dependent ax - onal transport could , however , be mediated by the long actin filaments that run along the axon shaft . The quasi - 1D , periodic , actin - spectrin cyto - skeleton may instead provide elastic and stable mechanical support for the axon membrane , giv - en the flexibility of spectrin . Elastic and stable support is particularly important for axons , be - cause they can be extremely long and thin and have to withstand mechanical strains as ani - mals move ( 37 ) . Indeed , the loss of b - spectrin in Caenorhabditis elegans leads to spontaneous breaking of axons , which is caused by mechan - ical strains generated by animal movement and can be prevented by paralyzing the animal ( 37 ) . The highly periodical submembrane cytoskeleton can also influence the molecular organization of the plasma membrane by organizing important membrane proteins along the axon . We found that sodium channels were distributed periodically along the axon initial segment in a coordinated manner with the underlying actin - spectrin cyto - skeleton . An axonal plasma membrane with pe - riodically varying biochemical and mechanical properties may not only influence how an action potential is generated and propagated , but might also affect how axons interact with other cells .

To identify genetic changes associated with the development of bat - specific traits , we performed whole - genome sequencing and comparative analyses of two distantly related species , fruit bat Pteropus alecto and insectivorous bat Myotis davidii . We discovered an unexpected concentration of positively selected genes in the DNA damage checkpoint and nuclear factor k B pathways that may be related to the origin of flight , as well as expansion and contraction of important gene families . Comparison of bat genomes with other mammalian species has provided new insights into bat biology and evolution . B ats belong to the order Chiroptera with - in the mammalian clade Laurasiatheria ( 1 ) . Although consensus has not been reached on the exact arrangement of groups with - inLaurasiatheria , a recentstudyplaced Chiroptera as a sister taxon to Cetartiodactyla ( whales + even - toed ungulates such as cattle , sheep , and pigs ) ( 2 ) . The Black flying fox ( Pteropus alecto ) and David ’ s Myotis ( Myotis davidii ) represent the Yinpterochiroptera and Yangochiroptera subor - ders , respectively , and display a diverse range of phenotypes ( Fig . 1 ) . Captive colonies , immor - talized cell lines , and bat - specific reagents have been developed for these two species ; however , genomic data are currently unavailable . The most conspicuous feature of bats , distin - guishing them from all other mammalian species , is the capacity for sustained flight .
