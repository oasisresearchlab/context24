Schwarz 1 , * 1 Division of Neuroscience Children’s Hospital Department of Neurobiology Harvard Medical School Boston , Massachusetts 02115 2 Life Sciences Centre Dalhousie University Halifax , Nova Scotia B3H 4J1 Canada Summary Many types of synapses have highly characteristic shapes and tightly regulated distributions of active zones , parameters that are important to the function of neuronal circuits . The development of terminal ar - borizations must therefore include mechanisms to regulate the spacing of terminals , the frequency of branching , and the distribution and density of release sites . At present , however , the mechanisms that con - trol these features remain obscure . Here , we report the development of supernumerary or ‘‘satellite’’ bou - tonsinavarietyofendocyticmutantsatthe Drosophila neuromuscular junction . Mutants in endophilin , syn - aptojanin , dynamin , AP180 , and synaptotagmin all show increases in supernumerary bouton structures . These satellite boutons contain releasable vesicles and normal complements of synaptic proteins that are correctly localized within terminals . Interestingly , however , synaptojanin terminals have more active zones per unit of surface area and more dense bodies ( T - bars ) within these active zones , which may in part compensate for reduced transmission per active zone . The altered structural development of the synapse is selectively encountered in endocytosis mutants and is not observed when synaptic transmission is re - duced by mutations in glutamate receptors or when synaptic transmission is blocked by tetanus toxin . We propose that endocytosis plays a critical role in sculpting the structure of synapses , perhaps through the endocytosis of unknown regulatory signals that organize morphogenesis at synaptic terminals . Results and Discussion At the neuromuscular junctions ( NMJs ) of third instar Drosophila larvae , the morphology of each synapse onto a particular body wall muscle is highly stereotyped [ 1 ] and results from a combination of embryonic devel - opment and postembryonic growth [ 2 ] . Within these ter - minals , active zones obey a minimum spacing function , even in mutants that have altered morphology of the bouton [ 3 ] . While studying mutations in the proteins of the synap - tic endocytic apparatus , we have noted that there are consistent changes in the structure of these synapses . Endophilin is a protein that accelerates clathrin - medi - atedendocytosis [ 4 ] andinteractswithseveralotherpro - teins in the endocytic pathway [ 5 , 6 ] . We noted that the neuromuscular junctions of third instar larvae homozy - gous for endo D 4 , a null allele of endophilin [ 7 ] , contained numerous satellite boutons , i . e . , small supernumerary boutons protruding from the primary terminal axis ( Fig - ure 1 ) . This phenotype strongly resembled that of dap160 mutants [ 8 , 9 ] . The endo D 4 phenotype was fully penetrant at all NMJs , but we chose to count satellite boutons of the single axon that innervates the middle of muscle4becauseofitsrelativesimplicityandsuitabil - ity for quantiﬁcation [ 8 ] . We deﬁned satellite boutons as small protrusions emanating from the primary axial branch of nerve terminals . Control larvae had very few satellite boutons ( 2 . 48 6 0 . 33 per NMJ , mean 6 SEM , n = 21 ) , but there was a 10 - fold increase in endo D 4 mu - tants ( 30 . 8 6 1 . 9 , n = 25 ; Figures 1A and 1B ) . To control for the genetic background , we examined larvae homo - zygousforanotherallele , endo 1 , aswellas endo 1 / endo D 4 larvae ; both had abundant supernumerary boutons ( 31 . 1 6 2 . 2 and 30 . 5 6 1 . 4 satellite boutons / synapse , n = 24 and 39 ; Figures 1C and 1D ) . At these synapses , the boutons remained conﬁned to the region of the mus - cle that normally receives the innervation , but this region was now crowded by the overgrowth of small boutons . At the end of embryogenesis , no abnormalities were ap - parent in the endophilin mutants ( data not shown ) . Therefore , the satellite boutons must arise during larval development , a period in which the NMJ expands exten - sively . To test whether the increase in satellite boutons was due to a lack of endophilin function in the nervous systemormusculatureandtoensurethatthisphenotype results speciﬁcally from a lack of endophilin , we ex - pressed endophilin in the null mutant background with drivers speciﬁc for either neurons or muscles ( see Sup - plemental Experimental Procedures available with this article online ) . Neuronal expression restored wild - type structure to these synapses ( 2 . 75 6 0 . 50 satellite bou - tons / synapse , n = 24 ; Figure 1E ) , but expression in mus - cle did not ( data not shown ) . Thus , the development of supernumerary bouton structures results from a lack of endophilin function in the nervous system . To determine the extent to which these satellite bou - tons were true synaptic endings , we characterized the expression and localization of both pre - and postsynap - tic proteins in endophilin mutants . The synaptic vesicle proteins synaptotagmin and cysteine string protein were present at both satellite boutons and the main axial boutons ( Figures 2A and 2C and data not shown ) . Simi - larly , expression of the postsynaptic marker discs large was associated with both satellite and axial contacts . As expected for a functional synapse , the active zone * Correspondence : thomas . schwarz @ childrens . harvard . edu marker nc82 within the satellite boutons [ 10 ] was cor - rectly juxtaposed to postsynaptic clusters of the essen - tial glutamate receptor subunit DGluRIII [ 11 ] ( Figures 2B and2D ) . Therefore , despitethealteredpatterningofbou - tons at the NMJ , the numerous small varicosities in endo mutants have the predicted organization of a functional synaptic bouton . dap160 mutants were reported to have a mislocaliza - tion and / or instability of several endocytic proteins in synaptic terminals , so we were concerned that the syn - aptic overgrowth in endophilin mutants may be an indi - rect consequence of dap160 instability or mislocaliza - tion or perhaps instability of other synaptic proteins . Synaptojaninhasalready been shownto bemislocalized in endophilin mutants [ 12 ] , butwefoundnormalimmuno - ﬂuorescence levels and distributions of dap160 and dy - namin in endophilin ( Figures 2E – 2G ) . Similarly , fasciclin II , a cell - surface protein important in synaptogenesis , was normal in endophilin terminals , as was the neuronal membrane marker HRP ( Figure 2G ) . Interestingly , when we quantiﬁed the immunoﬂuorescence levels of the ac - tive zone marker nc82 , we found a signiﬁcant increase in endophilin mutant terminals ( 1 . 39 6 0 . 09 compared with controls , 1 . 0 6 0 . 02 ﬂuorescence units , p < 0 . 01 ; Figure 2G ) . This increase is likely to reﬂect an increase in the number of active zones and / or dense bodies per synapse . Indeed , we counted 65 % more nc82 puncta at the muscle 4 synapse in endo D 4 than in control w 1118 larvae ( 323 . 8 6 16 . 8comparedwith196 . 9 6 11 . 2persyn - apse ; mean 6 SEM , n = 17and23 , p < 0 . 001 ) . Thisislikely to be an underestimate of active zones , particularly in the mutant terminals , due to the inability to distinguish closelyspacedpuncta ( seebelow ) . Thus , wedetermined that most endocytic proteins retain correct detectable distributions in endophilin mutants , but more active zones are present . Because both dap160 and endophilin mutants dis - played satellite boutons , we considered whether mu - tants in synaptojanin ( synj ) also display this phenotype . Synaptojanin is an inositol phosphatase that is recruited by endophilin to endocytic sites to promote synaptic vesicle uncoating [ 12 – 14 ] . By using null alleles of synj [ 4 ] , we found structural defects in synaptic growth simi - lar to those seen in endo mutants , 12 . 2 6 0 . 69 ( mean 6 SEM , n = 33 ) satellite boutons / synapse in synj LY / Df ( 2R ) x58 - 7 , compared with 3 . 1 6 0 . 41 in controls ( n = 25 ; Figures 3A , 3B , and 3L ) . This 4 - fold increase was sta - tistically signiﬁcant ( p < 0 . 001 ; Figure 3L ) and could be rescued by presynaptic , but not postsynaptic , expres - sion of a GFP - tagged synaptojanin transgene ( 2 . 86 6 0 . 42 per synapse , n = 21 ; Figures 3C and 3L ) . Thus , as in endophilin and dap160 , the defects result from the lack of neuronal expression of the endocytic protein . Synaptic transmission occurs at the neuromuscular junctionsofboth synj and endo mutants [ 4 , 7 , 12 ] . Dosat - ellite boutons release and recycle synaptic vesicles or does all transmission in synj terminals occur at the axial boutons ? To answer this directly , we used the lipophilic dye FM1 - 84 to monitor the synaptic vesicle cycle . Both control and synj terminals take up the dye when stimu - lated by electrical activity , because the absence of syn - aptojanin slows , but does not prevent , vesicle recycling and dye loading ( [ 4 ] ; Figures 3D and 3E ) . We loaded synj terminals with FM1 - 84 and found that the small sat - ellite boutons , like the main axial boutons , could be loaded with dye and subsequently destained upon de - polarization ( Figure 3F and data not shown ) . Thus , these structures were capable of activity - dependent exocyto - sis and endocytosis of synaptic vesicles . Are satellite boutons a general property of endocyto - sis mutants ? The best - studied endocytosis mutant in Drosophila is shibire ts1 , a temperature - sensitive muta - tion in the gene encoding dynamin . Dynamin is required for membrane ﬁssion , the pinching off of endocytosed vesicles from the plasma membrane . In shibire , at per - missive temperatures ( 18ºC and lower ) , vesicles are en - docytosed normally , but at elevated temperatures ( 29ºCandhigher ) , endocytosisisblocked [ 15 , 16 ] . shibire ( shi ) ﬂies cannot survive for prolonged periods at the completely restrictive temperature of 29ºC , but we could maintain them at an intermediate condition of 25ºC , the temperature at which the other control and mutant stocks were raised . Under these conditions , shi ts1 larvae resembled synj mutants , with 12 . 5 6 1 . 0 satellite bou - tons / synapse ( n = 26 , Figures 3H and 3L ) . As expected for this temperature - sensitive mutant , the phenotype did not arise at the permissive temperature of 18ºC Figure 1 .

Finally , synaptotagmin , a calcium binding protein that promotes transmitter release , has also been shown to have a direct role in synaptic endo - cytosis , probably in part by recruiting the AP2 complex [ 19 – 21 ] . In null mutants of synaptotagmin , we observed two differences in terminal morphology compared with wild - type . Axons were thinner and more highly branched than controls ( Figure 3J ) . Also , there were more satellite boutons protruding from the branches , with 19 . 9 6 1 . 1 / synapse in syt AD4 ( n = 31 ; Figures 3J and 3L ) . Thus , while the satellite boutons were consistent with the other en - docytic mutants studied , the distinctive thinning and branching of axons might arise from the impairment of exocytosis in syt mutants . The satellite boutons of each endocytic mutant contained synaptic vesicle and active zone components ( data not shown ) , indicating that , as in endophilin mutants , the supernumerary synapses were likely to be functional . All endocytosis mutations alter the release of neuro - transmitter to some degree . The anatomical phenotype in these lines could therefore conceivably arise from de - creases in synaptic transmission per se rather than de - fects speciﬁcally in endocytosis . To test this hypothesis , we diminished transmission with glutamate receptor mutations . Mutants in the glutamate receptor , DGluRIII , have reduced transmission at the larval NMJ that results from greatly decreased postsynaptic sensitivity [ 11 ] . Here , we observed wild - type bouton structure ( 3 . 1 6 0 . 5 satellite boutons / synapse ; n = 22 ; Figures 3K and 3L ) . Thus , reductions in synaptic strength are not sufﬁ - cient to develop the phenotype observed in endocytic mutants . It remained possible that the satellite boutons arise secondarily from a decrease in release of either gluta - mate or of another molecule released by synaptic vesi - cles . We therefore compared thephenotype of theendo - cytosis mutants with the consequences of a complete block of presynaptic release , achieved through the ex - pression of a tetanus toxin transgene ( UAS - TNT - G ; [ 22 ] ) . Widespread expression of this toxin is lethal and therefore prevents the analysis of the third instar NMJ . We found , however , that the rotund promoter ( rn - GAL4 ; [ 23 ] ) could drive expression of the transgene in a subset of ventral thoracic motor neurons throughout larval development , while maintaining the viability of the organism . Although tetanus toxin blocks all evoked release at the Drosophila NMJ [ 22 ] , satellite boutons were not increased at these poisoned synapses relative tocontrols ( 2 . 4 6 0 . 7comparedwith3 . 0 6 0 . 8incontrols , n = 17 and 12 ; Figure S1 ) . In endophilin mutants , these rotund - expressing thoracic motor neurons do produce satellite boutons ( 25 . 1 6 4 . 1 , n = 13 ; Figure S1 ) , com - parable to those previously quantiﬁed at abdominal muscle4 . Therefore , becausecompleteblockadeofsyn - aptic transmission does not produce satellite boutons , whereas a comparatively subtle change in transmission in endophilin larvae does , the satellite boutons must arise as a direct consequence of the defect in endocyto - sis per se and not indirectly as a consequence of altered transmitter release .

Endocytosis and Synaptic Development 593 The anatomical defect observed at synapses of endo - cytosis mutants raised the possibility that there may be ultrastructural changes in the synaptic boutons as well . In three - dimensional reconstructions of synj third instar larval terminals on muscles 6 and 7 , we observed changes in both active zones and dense bodies . Within the reconstructed segments of roughly equal length , the wild - type terminals had a total of 59 active zones while the synj terminals had a 22 % increase , with 72 active zones ( Figures4A – 4C ) . Thiscorrelateswithwhatwasob - servedatthelightmicroscopiclevelinFigure2 . Themean area of an active zone appeared larger in wild - type Figure 3 .

Current Biology 594 ( Figure 4C ) , but the difference was not signiﬁcant ( p = 0 . 11 , t test ) , chieﬂy because of variation in the wild - type sample . The area occupied by a single dense body did not differ between genotypes ( Figure 4C ) . However , the spacing density of synapses differed signiﬁcantly , withactivezonesbeingabout50 % moredenselyspaced over the plasma membrane of synj terminals than over wild - type ones ( p = 0 . 013 , t test ; Figure 4D ) . The value of Ra , the mean nearest neighbor distances between the centers of active zones , did not differ signiﬁcantly be - tween terminals of the two genotypes ( Figure 4C ) , how - ever , despite the increased number of active zones and their increased density in synj terminals , indicating that active zones were arranged to maximize their spacing distance . Differences were also seen within active zone regions . Inwild - typeterminals , mostactivezonescontainasingle dense body . In synj terminals , however , there were more dense bodies per active zone on average ( p = 0 . 001 , t test ; Figure 4D ) . This difference was attributable to more synj active zones having two dense bodies and fewer having one or none . Roughly 10 % of synj active zones even had three dense bodies , a phenomenon not encountered in wild - type boutons . Commensurate with their increased number , the overall crowding of dense bodies was about twice as high in synj terminals as in wild - type ones ( p = 0 . 013 , t test ) , and the value for Ra was smaller ( p = 0 . 0046 , t test ; Figure 4D ) , indicating that dense bodies in mutant terminals were spaced more closely to each other . The distribution of dense bodies , shown by the ratio Ra : Re ( see Supplemental Data ) , was about 1 in the wild - type , indicating that nor - mally dense bodies are randomly dispersed , whereas in synj terminals this ratio was less than 1 , signiﬁcantly different from wild - type ( p = 0 . 011 , t test ) . This indicates there is a tendency toward clustering dense bodies within individual mutant active zones ( Figure 4D ) , al - though active zones themselves were randomly distrib - uted in both synj and control . Thus , the structure of the neuromuscular junction is altered in synj mutants both in its overall architecture , by the presence of numerous satellite boutons , and also in its ultrastructure , through increases in the number and density of active zones and dense bodies . Conclusions We have shown that a wide variety of endocytosis mu - tants produce 4 – 10 times more satellite boutons than wild - type controls and with comparable severity to that previously reported in dap160 mutants [ 8 , 9 ] . The extent to which endocytosis was reduced in each genotype may differ . For example , synaptotagmin facilitates , but is not absolutely required for , endocytosis [ 19 , 21 , 24 ] , and the rate of classical endocytosis is slowed , but not abolished , in null alleles of synj and endo [ 4 ] . Further , Figure4 . 3DEMReconstructionsRevealIncreasedActiveZoneand Dense Body Areal Densities in synj Terminals ( A ) Wild - type terminals from Axon 1 ( blue ) and Axon 2 ( green ) illus - trates the size , distribution , and spacing of active zones ( yellow ) and the number and distribution of T - bar dense bodies ( red ) .

All graphs are 6 SD . Endocytosis and Synaptic Development 595 AP180 mutants retain the ability to endocytose synaptic vesicles , even though vesicle size is altered [ 17 ] , and shi - bire was studied at a temperature that does not fully block endocytosis . Indeed , because endocytosis is es - sential for viability , the satellite boutons arise from the impairment rather than the abolition of endocytosis in each mutant studied . Endocytosis mutations have also been shown to alter bouton number at the neuromuscu - lar junction [ 25 ] and synaptic development in the giant ﬁber system [ 26 ] . Secondary changes in the amount of synaptic trans - mission are not likely to account for the anatomical changes reported here because neither a severe loss of postsynaptic sensitivity in DGluRIII mutants nor the poi - soning of the fusion machinery for presynaptic release with tetanus toxin caused any increase in satellite bou - tons . Similarly , we have examined mutants in eag , Sh , and nap ts , mutations that alter neuronal excitability , and have not observed satellite boutons ( data not shown ) . Thus , the mutant phenotype correlates with the loss of endocytosis per se . Mutations in none of the known signaling pathways at the Drosophila NMJ display phenotypes resembling the satellite boutons we observe . The BMP , highwire , and activity - dependent pathways seem to regulate the ex - tent of the muscle surface covered by the neuronal terminal and the size and strength of synaptic boutons [ 27 – 30 ] , but satellite boutons have not been reported in these mutants . However , mutations in some synaptic proteins give rise to altered synaptic morphologies that resemble , atleast inpart , thesatellite boutons described here [ 31 – 34 ] . It is possible , therefore , that these mole - cules ( appl , spastin , shaggy , and dlar ) are elements of a developmental process that is disrupted by endocyto - sis mutants . The increased density of active zones and dense bodies in endocytosis mutants also represents an unusual phenotype . In fasciclin II mutants , for exam - ple , the spacing of active zones remains normal despite alterationsinthemorphology andnumberofboutons [ 3 ] . However , changes in postsynaptic sensitivity can cause increases in the density of presynaptic release sites [ 35 ] , and a similar compensatory mechanism may explain the increased density of active zones we observed in endo - philin and synaptojanin mutants . Thus , the phenotype linked to endocytic defects at these synapses cannot readily be tied to any of the previously known signaling pathways , and the mechanism for satellite bouton for - mation may be distinct from that which regulates active zone number and spacing . To explain the generation of satellite boutons , we have considered three hypotheses : that they arise ( 1 ) as an in - direct consequence of excess surface membrane ; ( 2 ) from the direct involvement of endocytic proteins in cy - toskeletal organization ; and ( 3 ) from a defect in a signal - ing pathway , regulated by endocytosis , that normally controls bouton growth and spacing . The ﬁrst of these hypotheses is the most straightforward , but is difﬁcult to reconcile with the details of the anatomical pheno - types . The satellite boutons are not simple infoldings of the membrane , but are highly organized , functional , andconnectedbystalkstotheaxialboutons . Inaddition , a net shift of synaptic vesicles to the plasma membrane could not explain increases in active zone number and the density of active zones and dense bodies . Thus , an inability to recover synaptic vesicle membrane might contribute to the phenotype ; however , considerable re - modeling of the synapse , including the addition of new active zones , would have to follow as a consequence . The second hypothesis , stipulating a direct ability of these endocytic proteins to organize the cytoskeleton , was proposed as an explanation of the phenotype of dap160 mutants , an endocytic protein that may interact with Cdc42 / N - WASP and its effectors [ 8 , 9 , 36 ] and has been suggested to serve as a regulator of the actin cytoskeleton [ 37 ] . Asimilarexplanationwasalsoinvoked in nervous wreck mutants , which alter a WASP binding protein that may regulate the cytoskeleton and whose synapticbranchingphenotypemayormaynotberelatedtosatelliteboutons [ 38 ] . However , most of the proteins we have studied are not known to interact directly with the cytoskeleton or its regulators . The third hypothesis is highly speculative—that endo - cytosis is crucial to one or more signaling pathways in the nerve terminal that regulate bouton growth and ac - tive zone formation at the neuromuscular junction . The satellite boutons and altered active zone spacing , how - ever , are unlike the phenotypes associated with known ligands and receptors at the neuromuscular junction ; this hypothesis therefore suggests the presence of a novel pathway controlling the development of this syn - apse . Plausibly , this could be a factor secreted by either the nerve or muscle that promotes the formation of side branches and whose surface receptor is inactivated by endocytosis . Alternatively , it could be a factor that sup - presses bouton and active zone formation and whose receptorrequiresinternalization , perhapsintoasignaling endosome , for efﬁcacy . These possibilities must remain conjectural pending the identiﬁcation of the hypothe - sized signaling pathways . A previous analysis indicated that active zones in var - ious genotypes conform to a regular spacing function , which ensures that neighboring active zones are spaced between 0 . 84 m m and 1 . 05 m m apart in the boutons of Axon 1 [ 3 ] . This spacing was also conﬁrmed for the wild - type boutons examined here ( Ra = 0 . 94 m m ) and suggests that each active zone exerts an inhibitory in - ﬂuence on nearby synaptogenesis . In synj boutons , however , we found that active zones are more densely packed ( Ra = 0 . 75 m m ) and have more dense bodies than control boutons . Active zones are slightly smaller in synj than in wild - type boutons , so that the percentage of the bouton plasma membrane covered by active zone remains roughly constant , with 38 % – 46 % of the surface area in both mutant and control terminals falling outside the active zone region . It is in this region , the periactive zone , thatproteinsoftheendocyticpathwayareconcen - trated , each active zone being surrounded by anannulus of endocytic machinery to form an integral zone of recy - cling [ 8 , 39 , 40 ] . The persistence of this region in synj is consistent with our immunocytochemical observations that other endocytotic proteins remain localized to peri - active zones in synj terminals ( data not shown ) and that the classical endocytotic pathway endures in synj mutants [ 4 ] . Theincreasednumberofdensebodiesperactivezone in synj mutant boutons resembles that seen after neuro - muscular transmission is strengthened by raising wild - type larvae at 29ºC , relative to those raised at 18ºC [ 41 ] . Current Biology 596 The correlation of dense - body number with synaptic strength suggests that this aspect of the synj phenotype may be part of a compensatory mechanism to offset any decreases in exocytosis resulting from vesicle de - pletion . We and others have determined that , at low fre - quencies of stimulation , synj synapses release normal levels of quanta despite a greatly decreased pool of ves - icles in the terminal [ 4 , 12 ] . The anatomical phenotype of synj may , at least in part , account for this release : the in - creased number of boutons and the spacing density of dense bodies at active zones increases the number of release sites at least 2 - fold per neuromuscular junction ; this change in dense - body number may reﬂect an in - crease in release probability per active zone . The analysis of mutations in endocytic proteins has il - luminated the process by which the ﬁne features of the synapse are sculpted during development . We have found that endocytosis per se is needed for the normal organization of the neuromuscular junction and hypoth - esize that this process is required as part of a signaling system organizing synaptic growth . Interestingly , the endocytic machinery is localized to periactive zone re - gions , areas in which many signaling molecules that reg - ulate synaptic development also reside [ 38 , 42 , 43 ] . This juxtaposition of the apparatus for synaptic endocytosis with one for developmental signaling is consistent with aroleforendocytosisinregulatingdevelopment , inaddi - tion to its established role in synaptic vesicle recycling . Moreover , the ultrastructural changes in synj terminals suggest a homeostatic , compensatory mechanism to adapt active zone spacing and synaptic strength in response to diminished vesicle recycling .
