Jakimo , whose comment at a meeting of the Interstate Alliance on Stem Cell Research inspired collection of these data . stem cell programs , as well as similar state programs supporting other areas of science , is uncertain . The analysis here suggests that state stem cell funding programs are sufficiently large and established that simply ending the programs , at least in the absence of substantial investment in the field by other funding sources , could have deleterious effects . Such action would fail to capitalize on the initial efforts of scientists who have been drawn to the field of stem cell research by state programs and leave many stem cell scientists suddenly searching for funding to continue their research . Large - scale state funding for basic research is a relatively new phenomenon , and many questions remain about the impact of these programs on the development of scientific fields and the careers of scientists . The influence of state funding programs on the distribution of research publications , the acquisition of future external funding , the creation of new companies and the translation of basic research into medical practice , for instance , are important unanswered questions . Similarly , comparing state funding programs with federal funding programs as well as foundations could offer new insight into the relative priorities of different funding bodies and the extent to which their funding portfolios overlap or are distinct . We hope the analysis presented here and the public release of the underlying database will inspire additional analysis of state science funding programs generally and state - funded stem cell science in particular .

A milestone has been achieved with the inclusion of expression data for > 50 % of the human protein - coding genes . The main new feature of the release is an attempt towards a knowledge - based portal , including an annotated protein expression feature for protein targets analyzed with two or more antibodies , and the establishment of the main subcellular localization of protein targets . In 2005 , the first version of the Human Protein Atlas ( http : / / www . proteinatlas . org / ) was released with protein profile data based on immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays covering 48 different human tissues and organs , including kidney , liver , heart , brain and pancreas 1 . The first version included data from 718 antibodies corresponding to 650 human protein - coding genes . High - resolution images were published along with annotation of the presence or absence of a particular protein target in all represented tissues . The 2005 Human Protein Atlas also contained information regarding protein profiles from 20 different types of human cancer , including breast , colorectal , lung and prostate cancer . The data in the portal were made available freely both for academia and industry without restrictions or password protection . In 2007 , the portal was extended to also include subcellular profiling data 2 using immunofluorescence - based confocal microscopy in three human cancer cell lines of different ( glial , mesenchymal and epithelial ) origin . More data have been added to the portal every year since the first release 3 and version 6 , launched in March 2010 , contained 11 , 274 antibodies corresponding to 8 , 489 protein - coding genes . This entire effort depends heavily on the availability of good quality antibodies , and recently a community - based portal , Antibodypedia ( http : / / www . antibodypedia . org / ) , has been launched to allow antibodies from different providers to be listed and compared 4 , 5 , although the main source of information so far comes from the providers’ own validation data , not by independent third - party users . At present , the Antibodypedia contains close to 100 , 000 antibodies , corresponding to > 70 % of the protein - coding genes in humans . An important objective has now been reached with the inclusion of 10 , 118 protein - coding genes corresponding to > 50 % of the 19 , 559 human entries as defined by UniProt , including only entries with evidence at protein Towards a knowledge - based Human Protein Atlas C O R R E S P O N D E N C E © 201 0 N a t u r e A m e r i ca , I n c . A ll r i gh t s r e se r ve d . nature biotechnology volume 28 number 12 DeCember 2010 1249 the resulting annotated protein expression . The annotated protein expression in the various cell types are obtained by a knowledge - based process taking into account staining from at least two antibodies , literature and additional experimental data . For the ESR1 ( Fig . 2 ) , one of the antibodies shows weak staining in tissues such as those of the prostate and urinary bladder , most likely due to nonspecific staining , but the conflation of data from the three antibodies suggests exclusive expression in breast and female reproductive tissues . It is important to point out that this annotated protein expression should be considered as the best estimate of the true expression based on the experimental data available , but that additional data and input from the scientific community may lead to subsequent revisions for a small fraction of the human genes , these subcellular localization data are a valuable resource for defining the protein content of the various compartments of the human cell and can thus constitute a starting point for further in - depth functional studies . A new organ view has been designed to allow cell types of similar origin to be easily compared . The tissues and organs have been divided into 12 functional classes , including central nervous system ( CNS ) , hematopoietic , cardiovascular and female and male reproductive tissues . In this release , a total of 66 normal cell types from 46 tissues and organs have been scored . As an example , in Figure 2 , we show part of the protein profiles for the human estrogen receptor 1 ( ESR1 ) , including the results from antibody staining of three independent antibodies and or transcript level and proteins inferred from homology 6 ( Fig . 1 ) . The chromosomal coverage of protein - coding genes is shown in Figure 1a and the status for a selection of important protein classes is reported in Figure 1b . Almost 80 % of the human kinases and Src - homology 2 domain – containing proteins and > 50 % of the transcription factors have protein profiling data in the atlas . We introduce the concept of annotated protein expression for paired antibodies , in which two or more independent antibodies are used to validate the staining pattern of each other . The immunohistochemical staining in each tissue or organ by the independent antibodies is compared and a new annotated protein expression is manually curated for each cell type in each tissue or organ . A reliability score is generated as an estimation of the degree of knowledge - based certainty of the reported expression profile . The reliability score is based on the similarity of the staining for the different antibodies , but also takes into account available information from literature , bioinformatics predictions and additional experimental evidence , such as western blots , transcript profiling and / or small interfering RNA knockdowns ( Supplementary Notes ; http : / / www . proteinatlas . org / about / quality + scoring ) . Approximately 2 , 000 protein - coding genes have annotated protein expression patterns in this launch and > 75 % of these have been scored with a high or medium reliability score ( Fig . 1c ) . It is noteworthy that , at present , the majority of the proteins in the atlas have only been analyzed with a single antibody and thus these genes are reported simply as antibody staining . The long - term objective of the Human Protein Atlas project is to generate at least two antibodies for all human protein - coding genes to allow knowledge - based annotated protein expression data for the complete human proteome . The new portal contains a summary page for every human gene ( Fig . 2 ) to allow for an easy entry point to navigate the detailed protein expression data . The summary page also serves as a convenient entry page from other related databases with a similar gene - centric format . The results from the curation and annotation of the staining patterns from one or several antibodies to the same protein target are summarized with links to details pages , including the original images . A new feature is a section for subcellular localization and here , the annotated knowledge - base of the subcellular distribution reports the main and additional subcellular location for each protein target in the analyzed cell .

Because all the data on the Human Protein Atlas are publicly available , the information can be integrated into other databases . The availability of the annotated expression patterns opens up the possibility for a community - based dialog to provide input by researchers with specialized knowledge about particular protein targets .

In the future , it might be relevant to move toward separate annotated protein expression profiles for each splice variant or other major alternative isoforms of a particular protein target . The annotated protein expression profiles allow a refinement of the global analysis of tissue specificity recently reported 14 , in which the staining of antibodies corresponding to one - third of the protein - coding genes suggested that a large portion of the human proteins are present across tissues in a relatively ubiquitous manner . An analysis based on the 2 , 000 protein targets with annotated protein expression profiles can now be performed and the result suggests a similar profile with a large subset of proteins detected across various cell types ( Fig . 1d ) . In conclusion , we here report on a new version of the Human Protein Atlas , where we have moved towards a knowledge - based portal with gene - centric expression profiles based on the annotation of several antibodies towards the same protein target . The Human Protein Atlas effort described here fits well into recent suggestions to initiate a gene - centric Human Proteome Project to map and characterize a representative protein from every protein - coding gene of humans 15 , 16 . In of the interpretation of protein expression in individual cells , tissues or organs . A new cancer view has been designed , allowing an easy overview of the results for all antibodies towards a particular protein target in tumor tissues from 216 patients representing 20 different types of cancer ( Fig . 2 ) . This overview also contains the results for the corresponding normal tissues for each cancer form . An advanced search function has been created to allow complex queries involving both normal and cancer tissues , including subcellular localization , validation results for the antibody and / or target protein classes . An additional feature is the possibility to customize the display of the results page by adding or deleting columns based on interest . An important objective is to allow the integration of this database with other ’omics databases covering genomics 7 , gene variation 8 , transcript profiling 9 , proteomics 10 or metabolomics 11 . All the expression data and the antibody staining data are therefore available for downloads to facilitate comparative expression studies and systems biology approaches . In the near future , we also plan to include additional experimental data from mass spectrometry – based proteomics 12 and transcriptomics profiling using next generation RNA - Seq 13 . An issue with the new gene - centric design is the presence of protein isoforms , including proteolytic variants , post - translational modifications and splice variants .
