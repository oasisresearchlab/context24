Supplemental Data S1 Clathrin - Mediated Constitutive Endocytosis of PIN Auxin Efﬂux Carriers in Arabidopsis Pankaj Dhonukshe , Fernando Aniento , Inhwan Hwang , David G . Robinson , Jozef Mravec , York - Dieter Stierhof , and Jirˇı´ Friml Supplemental Experimental Procedures Materials and Growth Conditions Arabidopsis seedlings ( Columbia ecotype ) were grown on vertical 0 . 5 MS agar plates at 25 (cid:2) C for 5 days . Transgenic Arabidopsis lines carrying the following gene fusions have been described before : PIN1 - GFP [ S1 ] , PIN2 - GFP [ S2 ] , ST - YFP [ S3 ] , GNOM - myc [ S4 ] , a1 - GFP [ S5 ] , PIP2 - GFP [ S6 ] , and LTi6b - GFP [ S6 ] . A transgenic Arabidopsis line carrying PIN2 - EosFP was obtained by Agrobacte - rium - mediated stable transformation . Protoplasts were isolated from the cultured Arabidopsis suspension cells and transformed as described before [ S5 ] . In all cases protoplasts displaying sufﬁ - cient cytoplasmic area for proper detection of intracellular struc - tures that can be differentiated from the plasma membrane were Figure S1 . PIN Localizes to Endosomes in the Presence of CHX , and Dominant - Negative Clathrin Hub1 Expression Does Not Strongly Inhibit Exocytosis ( A ) Localization of PIN2 to endosomes after 1 hr CHX ( 50 m M ) treatment . ( B and C ) Even 30 min after the green - to - red photoconversion of PIN2 - EosFP at the selected plasma - membrane area ( white arrowheads ) , the photoconverted PIN2 - EosFP ( red colored ) fails to show its fast lateral diffusion in the plasma membrane . This somewhat surprising ﬁnding indicates thatPINproteinsmaintaintheirlocalization atthespeciﬁc position intheplasmamembranedespite theassumed ﬂuidity oftheplasma membrane . The underlying mechanism for this is so far unknown and may involve some anchoring process at a particular localization in the plasma membrane . ( D and E ) Recovery of the PIN2 - EosFP ( green ) at the photobleached plasma - membrane region ( white arrowheads ) in protoplasts coexpressing RFP - Hub1 ( red ) . The controls ( B and C ) show that this recovery does not occur through lateral translocation but via exocytosis . Time is in min . analyzed . BFA ( Molecular Probes ) , Tyrphostin A23 ( Sigma ) , Tyrphostin A51 ( Sigma ) , and CHX ( Sigma ) were used from DMSO stock solutions ( 50 mM for BFA , 30 mM for Tyrphostin , and 50 mM for CHX ) and added to the liquid 0 . 5 MS growth medium for the indicated period of time . If not indicated otherwise , BFA treatment was performed for 60 min with 50 m M BFA ; Tyrphostin A23 or A51 treatments for 30 min with 30 m M Tyrphostin were followed eventu - ally by 60 min Tyrphostin / BFA cotreatment . BFA washout experi - ments were performed either by replacing initial BFA ( 50 m M , 60 min ) with Tyrphostin ( 30 m M , 120 min ) or by ﬁrst adding Tyrphostin ( 30 m M , 30min ) to BFA solution and then replacing it with Tryphostin ( 30 m M , 120 min ) . Tyrphostin ( 30 m M , 60 min ) washout experiments wereperformedbywashingitawayeitherwith0 . 5MSliquidmedium containing equal amounts of solvent or with BFA ( 50 m M ) . In control treatments , equal amounts of solvent were used . Constructs Hub1 Constructs The C - terminal 1860 bps part of Clathrin heavy chain1 from Arabi - dopsis cDNA was ampliﬁed with primers 5 0 - CCGCTCGAGAAGAAG TTTAACTTAAATGTTCAGGC - 3 0 and 5 0 - TACCCTAGGGTAGCCGCC CATCGGTGG - 3 0 and cloned into vector pBluescript to make the N - terminal GFP and RFP fusions driven by 35S promoter . PIN1 and PIN2 Constructs PIN1 - GFP was excised from PIN2 : : PIN1 - GFP pGreen [ S7 ] and cloned into vector pBluescript to have 35S : : PIN1 - GFP . 35S : : PIN2 - EosFP was constructed by PCR - based cloning in vector pBlue - script . For this , the ‘‘N’’ - terminal part of PIN2 was ampliﬁed from Arabidopsis cDNA with primers 5 0 - CCGCTCGAGATGATCACCGGC AAAGAC - 3 0 and 5 0 - GGGCCTAGGTTTAGTAGCGAGGTTGTC - 3 0 and PIN2 ‘‘C’’ - terminal part was ampliﬁed with primers 5 0 - GGGGTC GACGCGATGCAGAATCTGATAG - 3 0 and 5 0 - GGGACTAGTTTAAAGC CCCAAAAGAAC - 3 0 and EosFP was in - frame cloned between PIN2 ‘‘N’’ and ‘‘C’’ fragments . PIN2 - EosFP was then transferred to binary plant transformation vector pGreen . PIP2 Construct 35S : : PIP2 - EosFP was constructed by PCR - based cloning in vector pBluescript . For this , PIP2 was ampliﬁed from Arabidopsis cDNA with primers 5 0 - GGGGTCGACATGGCAA AGGATGTGGAAGC and 5 0 - GGGACTAGTTTAGACGTTGGCAGCAC - 3 0 . Immunodetection and Microscopy Immunoﬂuorescence analysis in Arabidopsis roots was carried out as described before [ S8 , S9 ] . The following antibodies were used : anti - clathrin ( 1 : 400 ) , anti - PM - ATPase ( 1 : 1000 ) , anti - PIN2 ( 1 : 800 ) , anti - PIN1 ( 1 : 400 ) , anti - ARF1 ( 1 : 1 , 000 ) , 9E10 anti - myc ( 1 : 600 ) , and Figure S2 . Tyrphostin A51 , an Inactive Analog of Tyrphostin A23 , Fails to Inhibit Internalization of Cargoes from the Plasma Membrane in Arabidopsis Root Cells ( A ) Internalization of PIN2 - GFP ( green ) and FM4 - 64 ( red ) into BFA compartments after BFA treatment in the presence of Tyrphostin A51 ( applied 30 min before BFA ) .

DAPI - stained nuclei are in blue . Figure S3 .

( D ) Tyrphostin A23 does not interfere with recovery of PIN1 ( red ) at the plasma mem - brane and recovery of normal a1 - labeled TGN ( green ) distribution after removal of BFA in the presence of active Tyrphostin A23 ( BFA 60 min followed by BFA + Tyrphos - tin A23 30 min further followed by Tyrphostin A23 120 min ) . DAPI - stained nuclei are in blue . S2 anti - GFP ( 1 : 400 ) . Fluorochrome - conjugated secondary antibodies ( Dianova ) were used at the following concentrations : anti rabbit - FITC ( 1 : 300 ) ; anti - rabbit - Cy3 ( 1 : 500 ) , and anti - mouse - FITC ( 1 : 300 ) . Thegeneration ofclathrin heavy - chain antibodyhasbeendescribed before [ S10 ] . For improved preservation of antigenicity and ultrastructure , a method was developed that combines cryoﬁxation ( high - pressure freezing [ HPF ] ) with the immunogold - labeling technique on ultrathin thawed cryo - sectionsthat use 1 nmgold marker ( Nanogold , Nanop - robes ) . After HPF , root tips were freeze - substituted in acetone containing uranyl acetate and glutaraldehyde ( and , in the case of Figures 2C – 2E , osmiumtetroxide ) . At 2 30 (cid:2) C , samples were washed with acetone containing glutaraldehyde , warmed up , and rehy - drated stepwise in H 2 O between 2 30 (cid:2) C and 0 (cid:2) C . Then samples were processed for ultrathin thawed cryo - section labeling . Nano - gold markers ( Nanogold , Nanoprobes ) were silver - enhanced for Figure S4 . Tyrphostin A23 Does Not Com - pletely Impair the Forward Trafﬁc toward the Plasma Membrane ( A – D ) FRAP analysis of LTi6b - GFP in control . ( E – H ) FRAP analysis of LTi6b - GFP that was bleached after 30 min preincubation with Tyrphostin A23 and recovery of the ﬂuores - cence observed in continuous presence of Tyrphostin A23 . Bleached regions are shown by dotted white rectangle in ( B ) and ( F ) . Time is in min . S3 8 min with HQ Silver ( Nanoprobes ) and observed with the trans - mission electron microscope ( TEM ) as described before [ S5 ] . Live - cellmicroscopywasperformedasdescribedpreviously [ S9 ] . For green - to - red photoconversion of EosFP , we used a 63 3 water immersion lens . For photoconversion , a desired area was selected and was pulsed with 100 % power of a 405 nm Diode UV laser for about 12 s . Unconverted EosFP ( green colored form ) was excited with 488 nm Ar / Kr laser ( 15 % power of the lowest output ) and detected by 500 – 530 nm emission slit , and its photoconverted form ( red colored form ) was excited with 561 nm Diode laser ( 30 % power of its total output ) and detected by 575 – 640 nm emission slit . One image was taken before photoconversion , and subsequent images were taken immediately after photoconversion by applying the same settings . Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) experiments were performed as described before [ S3 ] . For quantiﬁcation of PIN2 - GFP and FM4 - 64 colocalization , we selected the cytoplasmic area by excluding the plasma membrane and then obtained the colocalization values in the microscope - image - analy - sis Metamorph ofﬂine software ( Universal Imaging ) . Similarly , we also obtained the colocalization values in protoplast experiments . Supplemental References S1 .
