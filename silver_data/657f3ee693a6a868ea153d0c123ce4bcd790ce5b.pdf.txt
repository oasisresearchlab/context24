Accordingly , cells have developed efﬁcient repair mechanisms to rapidly reseal ruptures and reestablish membrane integrity . The cortical actin cytoskeleton plays an instrumental role in both plasma membrane resealing and restructuring in response to damage . Actin directly aids membrane repair or indirectly assists auxiliary repair mechanisms . Studies investigating single - cell wound repair have often focused on the recruitment and activation of specialized repair machinery , despite the undeniable need for rapid and dynamic cortical actin modulation ; thus , the role of the cortical actin cytoskeleton during wound repair has received limited attention . This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of membrane repair mechanisms directly or indirectly involving cortical actin cytoskeletal remodeling .

Introduction The plasma membrane ( PM ) constitutes a physical barrier protecting cells against external forces , thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis and ensuring cell survival [ 1 – 5 ] . The eukaryotic PM consists of a 5 – 10 nm lipid bilayer with a diverse assortment of in - tegral proteins , which translate external stimuli ( e . g . , secreted signaling molecules and tension induced by cell - cell adhesion ) into intracellular signaling transduction and cellular responses [ 6 ] ; thus , the PM not only shields cells against the extracellular milieu , but also permits cellular communication with the surrounding environment . Beneath the PM lies a meshwork of actin ﬁlaments , known as the cortical actin cytoskeleton , which strengthens and supports the PM through direct attachments ( Figure 1A ) [ 7 ] . In addition , actin ﬁla - ments together with microtubules and intermediate ﬁlaments are collectively responsible for maintaining cell shape and organization [ 8 ] . In addition to being an instrumental struc - tural component , the actin network plays a central role in both mechanical and biochemical signaling , whereby actin - dependent forces , amongst others , are essential for cell migration , intracellular trafﬁcking , cytokinesis and mechanosensing [ 9 ] . This functional diversity originates from a vast array of actin regulatory proteins [ 10 – 12 ] , which together with a large pool of globular ( G ) - actin monomers distributed throughout the cell allow rapid and dynamic modulation of the actin cytoskeleton without the need for prior transcriptional regulation [ 13 ] . These characteristics make the cortical actin cytoskeleton highly suitable for a role in PM repair ; however , despite the many known functions of actin , the mechanisms underlying actin cytoskeletal remodeling remain rather elusive .

Actin ‐ associated plasma membrane repair mechanisms in single ‐ cell wound repair . ( A ) The PM and underlying cortical actin cytoskeletal are intact and maintaining cellular homeostasis . ( B ) Disruption of the PM causes a rapid influx of Ca 2 + , which causes depolymerization of actin filaments to G ‐ actin monomers primarily through Ca 2 + ‐ dependent activation of intracellular calpain proteases .

Throughout the lifetime of a cell , membrane integrity can become compromised under different physiological and pathological conditions , such as skeletal muscle contraction and pore formation by toxins [ 2 , 3 , 14 ] . Loss of membrane integrity ultimately threatens cell survival , although the resultant loss of homeostasis can also drive acute and chronic pathologies ( e . g . , by causing calcium toxicity and chronic inﬂammation leading to tissue Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 10886 3 of 16 degeneration ) [ 3 ] . For this reason , cells are equipped with efﬁcient repair mechanisms to reestablish membrane integrity . Despite subtle differences across cell and injury types , the repair mechanisms are evolutionarily conserved , highlighting the importance of membrane integrity for cell survival . Both insufﬁcient and excessive repair capacities are associated with different pathologies , such as myopathies and cancer . An example is Duchenne mus - cular dystrophy , in which mutations in the gene encoding dystrophin , linking cytoskeletal ﬁlamentous ( F ) - actin with the extracellular matrix , make muscle cells more susceptible to mechanical damage [ 15 ] ; therefore , mechanistic insights into membrane repair could potentially lead to novel therapeutic strategies [ 1 , 16 , 17 ] . Studies investigating membrane repair have often focused on membrane fusion events ( via exocytosis - mediated repair ) , removal of injured membranes ( by endocytosis - mediated repair or shedding ) and recruitment or assembly of protein repair complexes ( e . g . , an - nexins and endosomal sorting complex required for transport ( ESCRT ) - III ) [ 1 , 14 , 18 – 20 ] ; however , the implication of the cortical actin cytoskeleton in membrane resealing and restructuring has received limited attention , despite the undeniable need for rapid and dynamic cytoskeletal changes in response to membrane damage and repair . Moreover , cellular adaptions to mechanical stimuli through actin - based mechanosensing must be tightly linked with membrane repair to orchestrate an appropriate and efﬁcient repair response following mechanical damage . This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of membrane repair mechanisms directly or indirectly involving cortical actin cytoskeletal remodeling and further touches upon the role of actin - based mechanosensing . 2 . Cortical Actin Dynamics in Membrane Resealing Disruption of the PM causes a rapid inﬂux of calcium ions ( Ca 2 + ) from the extracel - lular milieu due to a 10 , 000 - fold concentration gradient across the PM ( Figure 1B ) [ 21 ] . Accordingly , the wound size is proportional to the level of Ca 2 + inﬂux , which in turn activates and recruits repair machinery for membrane resealing [ 14 , 22 ] ; therefore , both the source or type of damage and the wound size are determining factors for the initial and follow - up responses . Importantly , Ca 2 + inﬂux not only activates and recruits repair machinery , but also drives actin cytoskeletal remodeling by depolymerizing actin ﬁlaments to G - actin [ 23 – 26 ] . Activation of intracellular calpain proteases is likely the primary cause of injury - induced cytoskeletal remodeling , as calpains have been demonstrated to be required for Ca 2 + - dependent single - cell wound repair by cleaving downstream targets such as the interme - diate ﬁlament , vimentin , and the actin – integrin linker , talin [ 25 , 26 ] . Disassembly of the cortical actin cytoskeleton is necessary , as the tensile forces generated by the cytoskeleton , which are essential for normal cell function and morphology , prevent efﬁcient membrane repair . For smaller wounds , actin cytoskeleton relaxation may be enough to drive thermo - dynamically favored membrane resealing [ 4 , 27 , 28 ] ; however , larger wounds require the assistance of a specialized repair machinery , which also depends on preliminary tension relief through Ca 2 + - mediated cortical actin depolymerization . In fact , compound - induced F - actin stabilization inhibits membrane resealing , whereas compound - induced F - actin depolymerization has been shown to enhance single - cell wound repair [ 29 ] . Actin re - polymerization succeeds the initial Ca 2 + - dependent depolymerization and cooperates with specialized repair machinery to mediate PM repair through a variety of mechanisms . Besides directly aiding PM resealing , the cortical actin cytoskeleton needs to undergo rapid and dynamic changes in order to meet the requirements of efﬁcient membrane repair , essentially making all PM repair mechanisms dependent on actin cytoskeletal dynamics . 2 . 1 . Wound Healing in Oocytes Oocytes of Xenopus laevis and Echinoidea have often been used to study single - cell wound repair , as their large size and lack of tension induced by cell – cell adhesion provide a simpler model to study repair compared to somatic cells . Oocytes have been reported to recover from large mechanical disruptions of the PM and underlying cytoskeleton Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 10886 4 of 16 ( > 1000 um 2 ) [ 30 – 32 ] . The rapid Ca 2 + inﬂux accompanying wounding stimulates immediate homotypic fusion of yolk granules at the injury site , resulting in the formation of a large ‘membrane patch’ that fuses with the wound edges in a Ca 2 + - dependent manner to reseal the damaged membrane [ 30 – 32 ] . Yolk granules serve as a readily available membrane source for patching in oocytes due to their abundance and close proximity to the PM . Initially , lysosomes and other non - secretory vesicles and organelles ( e . g . , enlargeosomes and mitochondria ) were proposed to take part in a type of patch - like formation at the injury site in somatic cells [ 33 – 36 ] ; however , these vesicles and organelles would in all likelihood not fulﬁll the spatiotemporal requirements for rapid and efﬁcient membrane repair ( reviewed in [ 3 , 37 – 41 ] ) . Interestingly , a recent study demonstrated a type of patch - mediated membrane repair in Dictystelium cells , in which de novo synthesis of vesicles at the injury served as the membrane source for patching [ 42 ] ; to date , this phenomenon has only been demonstrated in Dictystelium cells , which is why patch - mediated repair is generally more controversial in somatic cells . In Xenopus oocytes , Echinoidea oocytes and Drosophila early embryos , membrane in - tegrity is reestablished by the formation and contraction of an actomyosin purse string structure [ 43 – 47 ] . An actomyosin ring is anchored to the uninjured membrane at regu - lar intervals and aids PM restoration by pushing the injured membrane outward while dragging the uninjured membrane inward as the ring contracts ( Figure 1C ) [ 45 ] . Acto - myosin ring positioning , assembly and contraction are broadly conserved but vary with respect to GTPase orchestration and microtubule assembly and function [ 48 , 49 ] . In Xenopus oocytes , injury - triggered Ca 2 + inﬂux recruits and activates Ras homolog family member A ( RhoA ) and cell division control protein 42 homolog ( Cdc42 ) , which localize in mutually exclusive , concentric zones around the wound ( Figure 2A ) [ 44 , 48 ] . RhoA co - localizes with myosin II at the leading edge of the wound and is encircled by an outer ring of Cdc42 co - localizing with actin [ 48 , 50 ] . RhoA is believed to promote polymerization of stable , unbranched actin ﬁlaments at the wound edge through the recruitment and activation of actin nucleator diaphanous ( Dia ) and protein kinase N ( Pkn ) [ 51 ] . Cdc42 promotes the polymerization of dynamic , branched actin ﬁlaments at the wound periphery via activation of neural Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein ( N - WASP ) , which in turn activates actin - related proteins - 2 / 3 ( Arp2 / 3 ) [ 52 ] , consequently providing direct evidence that mem - brane repair requires both depolymerization and subsequent re - polymerization of actin . A microtubule network accumulates radially around the wound and recruits Arp2 / 3 and myosin II , thereby assisting in organizing ring assembly and contraction [ 43 , 53 ] . RhoA indirectly regulates myosin II light - chain phosphorylation by inﬂuencing the activity of myosin light - chain kinase ( MLCK ) and Rho - associated kinase ( ROCK ) [ 54 , 55 ] , thereby me - diating microtubule - dependent ring contraction ( Figure 2B ) . Remarkably , pharmacological inactivation of myosin failed to prevent wound closure in Xenopus oocytes , demonstrating that myosin - mediated contraction is dispensable for wound closure [ 50 ] ; however , the ring structure became less organized and wound closure occurred discontinuously upon myosin inactivation . Contraction - independent wound closure is mediated through a rapid turnover of actin , termed actin treadmilling , arising from a directional gradient in GTPase activity ( Figure 2C ) . Decreasing GTPase activity from the leading edge to the trailing edge of the wound promotes inward actin polymerization , which constricts and eventually seals the wound . Actin treadmilling is likely outplayed or complemented by myosin - mediated contraction during undisturbed wound closure , for which reason our understanding of actin treadmilling in membrane and cytoskeletal restructuring is limited .

Wound healing in Xenopus oocytes is accomplished by contraction of an actomyosin ring or actin treadmilling .

( B ) In detail , RhoA controls actomyosin contractibility by influencing the activity of MLCK and ROCK , which in turn regulates myosin II light chain phosphorylation levels . Accordingly , wound closure is promoted by actomyosin ‐ based ring contraction . ( C ) Alternatively , contraction ‐ independent wound closure can be mediated through actin treadmilling . Here , a directional GTPase activity gradient from the leading edge to the trailing edge of the wound results in inward actin polymerization , which constricts and eventually seals the wound ; however , actin treadmilling results in less organized and discontinuous wound closure . Ca 2 + : calcium ions ; Cdc42 : cell division control protein 42 homolog ; MLCK : myosin light ‐ chain kinase ; RhoA : Ras homolog family member A ; ROCK : Rho ‐ associated kinase . Actomyosin ring assembly and contraction are tightly controlled by GTPase orchestration , as GTPase activity modulates actin and myosin dynamics . GTPase patterning has been proposed to form in response to the injury ‐ induced reorganization of lipid domains at and proximal to the injury site [ 56 ] . Wounding of Xenopus oocytes triggers the formation of domains specifically enriched with phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 ‐ diphosphate ( PIP 2 ) , phosphatidylinositol 3 , 4 , 5 ‐ trisphosphate ( PIP 3 ) , phosphatidylserine ( PS ) , phosphatidic acid ( PA ) and diacylglycerol ( DAG ) . PS localizes at the zone of high RhoA activity closest to the wound , whereas PIP 2 and PIP 3 localize to the outer ring of high Cdc42 activity . Both PA and DAG localize to an intermediate zone with overlapping RhoA and Cdc42 activity . DAG ‐ enriched domains are able to recruit and activate protein kinase C ( PKC ) β and η , which may act as upstream regulators by stimulating and inhibiting RhoA and Cdc42 activity , respectively [ 56 ] ; thus , injury ‐ induced changes in PM composition may indirectly aid GTPase patterning , which in turn promotes PM restoration through actomyosin ring assembly and contraction . Actomyosin structures are evolutionarily conserved and are involved in different cellular processes in somatic cells ( e . g . , in cytokinesis and cell extrusion ) [ 57 ] ; however , they have not been implicated in PM repair . Somatic cells appear instead to be dependent on other types of highly specialized repair mechanisms , despite possessing the necessary machinery to form a contractile ring structure ; however , the reason why somatic cells refrain from using such structures in single ‐ cell wound repair is currently unknown [ 58 ] . Mechanisms based on other proteins may outcompete contractile ring structures in a repair context . For instance , annexins are capable of inducing membrane curvature and Figure 2 . Wound healing in Xenopus oocytes is accomplished by contraction of an actomyosin ring or actin treadmilling .

( B ) In detail , RhoA controls actomyosin contractibility by inﬂuencing the activity of MLCK and ROCK , which in turn regulates myosin II light chain phosphorylation levels . Accordingly , wound closure is promoted by actomyosin - based ring contraction . ( C ) Alternatively , contraction - independent wound closure can be mediated through actin treadmilling . Here , a directional GTPase activity gradient from the leading edge to the trailing edge of the wound results in inward actin polymerization , which constricts and eventually seals the wound ; however , actin treadmilling results in less organized and discontinuous wound closure . Ca 2 + : calcium ions ; Cdc42 : cell division control protein 42 homolog ; MLCK : myosin light - chain kinase ; RhoA : Ras homolog family member A ; ROCK : Rho - associated kinase . Actomyosin ring assembly and contraction are tightly controlled by GTPase orches - tration , as GTPase activity modulates actin and myosin dynamics . GTPase patterning has been proposed to form in response to the injury - induced reorganization of lipid domains at and proximal to the injury site [ 56 ] . Wounding of Xenopus oocytes triggers the forma - tion of domains speciﬁcally enriched with phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - diphosphate ( PIP 2 ) , phosphatidylinositol 3 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate ( PIP 3 ) , phosphatidylserine ( PS ) , phosphatidic acid ( PA ) and diacylglycerol ( DAG ) . PS localizes at the zone of high RhoA activity closest to the wound , whereas PIP 2 and PIP 3 localize to the outer ring of high Cdc42 activity . Both PA and DAG localize to an intermediate zone with overlapping RhoA and Cdc42 activity . DAG - enriched domains are able to recruit and activate protein kinase C ( PKC ) β and η , which may act as upstream regulators by stimulating and inhibiting RhoA and Cdc42 activity , respectively [ 56 ] ; thus , injury - induced changes in PM composition may indirectly aid GTPase patterning , which in turn promotes PM restoration through actomyosin ring assembly and contraction . Actomyosin structures are evolutionarily conserved and are involved in different cellular processes in somatic cells ( e . g . , in cytokinesis and cell extrusion ) [ 57 ] ; however , they have not been implicated in PM repair . Somatic cells appear instead to be dependent on other types of highly specialized repair mechanisms , despite possessing the necessary machinery to form a contractile ring structure ; however , the reason why somatic cells refrain from using such structures in single - cell wound repair is currently unknown [ 58 ] . Mechanisms based on other proteins may outcompete contractile ring structures in a Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 10886 6 of 16 repair context . For instance , annexins are capable of inducing membrane curvature and constriction during PM repair and are further capable of modulating actin dynamics [ 59 , 60 ] . 2 . 2 . Would Healing in Somatic Cells 2 . 2 . 1 . Protein - Mediated Plasma Membrane Repair Multiple members of the highly conserved Ca 2 + - binding annexin protein family are enriched at the injury site and play a direct or indirect role in the regulation of actin re - polymerization [ 1 , 4 , 60 , 61 ] . Annexin A2 ( ANXA2 ) and one of its interacting partners , S100 calcium binding protein A11 ( S100A11 ) , alter local actin dynamics in a direct manner— S100A11 and ANXA2 bind to F - actin and restrict the depolymerization of existing actin ﬁbers ( Figure 1D ) [ 62 , 63 ] . Actin re - polymerization may also be aided by the self - assembly of another annexin family member , ANXA5 , into 2D arrays around the wound edge , which is responsible for generating contractive forces [ 60 , 64 ] . Ca 2 + - mediated formation of S100A11 - ANXA2 complexes has been described to augment PM repair in invasive MCF7 breast cancer cells expressing a truncated version of the ErbB2 receptor ( MCF7 - p95ErbB2 ) [ 60 ] . The cumulative effect of annexin - mediated modulation of the actin cytoskeleton is evident following wounding of MCF7 - p95ErbB2 cells . In this case , Ca 2 + inﬂux triggers rapid local actin depolymerization and the recruitment of ANXA1 to the injury site , followed by Ca 2 + - dependent S100A11 - ANXA2 complex formation and its translocation to membranes adjacent to the injury . Here , S100A11 - ANXA2 complexes stimulate actin polymerization , which functions as a local repair zone , since buildup of F - actin promotes wound closure by pulling the membrane edges towards each other for eventual resealing and excision of damaged membrane marked by ANXA1 ( Figure 1D ) [ 60 ] . S100A11 and ANXA2 are overexpressed in various types of cancer and their overexpression is associated with tumor metastasis and poor prognosis [ 65 – 77 ] . In fact , loss of S100A11 - ANXA2 complexes impairs PM repair and the invasiveness of MCF7 - p95ErbB2 cells [ 60 ] . This highlights the therapeutic potential of targeting repair mechanisms in pathologies , such as cancer , in which cells are highly dependent on efﬁcient PM repair for survival . Neuroblast - differentiation - associated protein AHNAK ( AHNAK ) is known to form a complex with S100A11 - ANXA2 ( 2 : 2 ) in a Ca 2 + - dependent manner [ 78 – 80 ] . The AHNAK - S100A11 - ANXA2 heterotetramer has been proposed to regulate cortical actin cytoskeletal organization and the membrane cytoarchitecture through the ability of AHNAK to interact with both G - and F - actin [ 81 , 82 ] , suggesting that AHNAK - S100A11 - ANXA2 regulates the membrane cytoarchitecture by directly interacting with the cortical actin cytoskeleton . Accordingly , AHNAK depletion hinders cortical actin cytoskeleton reorganization [ 82 ] . Moreover , AHNAK is associated with enlargeosomes , which have been shown to undergo exocytosis in response to injury - induced Ca 2 + inﬂux ( see Section 2 . 2 . 2 ) [ 83 – 85 ] ; however , the role and mechanism of enlargeosome exocytosis in PM repair is still not well deﬁned , presumably due to lack of focus in favor of other repair mechanisms . In contrast to cancer cells that often display increased repair capacity , muscle cells often display deﬁcient repair capacity translating into different pathologies . Swaggart et al . identiﬁed ANXA6 as a crucial modiﬁer of muscular dystrophy [ 86 ] . Upon membrane injury , ANXA6 orchestrates into a clearly demarcated zone , termed a repair cap , at the injury site and mediates membrane repair ( Figure 1E ) . A carboxy terminally truncated version ANXA6 , incapable of membrane binding due to the lack of its PS - binding domain , was shown to disrupt repair cap formation and result in sarcolemmal leakiness [ 86 ] . Re - pair cap formation was later shown to be both Ca 2 + - and actin - dependent [ 87 ] . F - actin exhibits a temporal recruitment pattern identical to ANXA6 , accumulating within 14 sec - onds post - injury [ 87 ] . Interestingly , ANXA6 and F - actin accumulate in mutually exclusive zones with F - actin accumulating in a so - called clearance zone beneath the repair cap . Compound - induced inhibition of F - actin formation signiﬁcantly delayed repair cap forma - tion , whereas the removal of exogenous Ca 2 + completely abolished repair cap formation , demonstrating that Ca 2 + and actin re - polymerization are needed for ANXA6 translocation and repair cap formation , presumably facilitating sarcolemma repair by creating a cyto - Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 10886 7 of 16 plasmic located plug that reduces the exchange with the extracellular milieu . In addition to ANXA6 , annexin family members ANXA1 , ANXA2 and ANXA5 are recruited to the injury site and partake in repair cap formation ( Figure 1E ) [ 87 ] . The cumulative effect of this multimeric annexin complex on actin dynamics and vice versa is poorly understood , yet the annexin - rich repair cap and underlying F - actin structure must work together in a cooperative fashion , since both parties are required for efﬁcient sarcolemma repair . An adjacent shoulder of repair proteins , including dysferlin , EH domain - containing protein 1 ( EHD1 ) , EDH2 , Mitsugumin 53 ( MG53 ) and Myc box - dependent - interacting protein 1 ( BIN1 ) , further aids the repair process , and all proteins are required for optimal sarcolemma repair [ 87 ] . There is a delicate balance in membrane repair efﬁciency , as both insufﬁcient repair , as observed in myopathies , and excessive repair , as observed in cancer , comprise major pathological triggers ; therefore , increased insights into the mechanistic facets of PM re - pair , including actin dynamics , would open up largely unexplored therapeutics avenues applicable for a wide range of pathologies . 2 . 2 . 2 . Exocytosis - and Endocytosis - Mediated Plasma Membrane Repair In exocytosis - mediated repair , different intracellular compartments and organelles ( including endosomes , enlargeosomes , reserve or secretory granules and lysosomes ) fuse with the PM at the injury site ( Figure 1F ) [ 30 , 32 , 33 , 37 , 88 – 96 ] . Membrane patch formation comprises one model of exocytosis - mediated repair [ 30 – 32 ] . Andrews et al . proposed an alternative model in which exocytosis of intracellular membrane to the PM reduces in - plane tension , thereby bringing the wound edges closer together to promote membrane resealing facilitated by auxiliary repair mechanisms ( Figure 1F ) [ 1 , 60 , 97 – 99 ] . Accordingly , exocytosis - mediated reduction of in - plane tension has been demonstrated to be crucial for the repair of various types of membrane injuries ( reviewed in [ 3 , 100 ] ) . In somatic cells , lysosomes are proposed to be the main source of membrane material for exocytosis - mediated repair [ 33 , 96 ] ; however , it is uncertain whether lysosome exocytosis is able to fulﬁll the spatiotemporal requirements for rapid PM repair , especially for larger wounds , since the majority of lysosomes are located in the perinuclear region and require transport to the injury site [ 37 , 39 – 41 ] . Microtubule - dependent trafﬁcking facilitated by the motor proteins kinesin and dynein comprises the primary mechanism for long - distance vesicle transport [ 101 , 102 ] ; however , microtubule - independent long - distance vesicle transport is possible and can be accomplished through actin nucleation [ 41 ] . Once close to the cell pe - riphery , the cortical actomyosin network plays a central role in mediating vesicle anchoring , docking and fusion with the PM ( reviewed in [ 103 , 104 ] ) ; therefore , mesoscopic modulation of the cortical actomyosin network is needed to successfully execute exocytosis . On one hand the network comprises a mechanical barrier preventing vesicle fusion [ 29 ] , while on the other hand vesicle fusion cannot occur without some degree of actomyosin - mediated assistance [ 103 , 104 ] . Supportive of this biphasic relationship , compound - induced F - actin depolymerization reduced the initial rate of exocytosis in mast cells by impairing actin - mediated vesicle capture and transport , but increased the total level of vesicle secretion by weakening the cortical actin barrier [ 105 ] . Long - distance trafﬁcking of lysosomes from the perinuclear region to the cell pe - riphery is expected to be too slow to fulﬁll the sub - second demand for patch - mediated repair [ 40 , 41 ] . Instead , exocytosis - mediated PM repair may primarily aim to reduce in - plane tension at areas ﬂanking the injury site , thereby promoting repair through membrane relaxation . Furthermore , Andrews et al . proposed that exocytosis - mediated fusion of intracellular membrane not only serves to reduce in - plane tension , but also comprise a prerequisite for ensuing endocytosis - mediated repair and membrane restructuring [ 92 ] . Injury - induced lysosome exocytosis causes lysosomal secretion of acid sphingomyelinase ( ASM ) at the outer membrane leaﬂet , which cleaves the phosphorylcholine head of sph - ingomyelin to generate ceramide ( Figure 1F ) [ 106 , 107 ] . Formation of ASM - generated ceramide microdomains triggers membrane invaginations , thereby priming the dam - Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 10886 8 of 16 aged membrane regions for rapid internalization through both clathrin - dependent and - independent endocytosis ( Figure 1G ) [ 108 – 110 ] . Actin dynamics are instrumental in aiding in vesicle internalization , as actin supports several endocytic steps , including membrane invagination , scission of newly formed vesicles from the PM and vesicle trafﬁcking away from the PM ( reviewed in [ 111 – 113 ] ) . Taken together , exocytosis - and endocytosis - mediated repair appear to comprise a tandem process in which initial in - plane tension release promotes membrane reseal - ing , followed by ASM driven membrane restructuring to reestablish membrane integrity . Moreover , endocytosis has long been considered the primary repair mechanism for pore - mediated membrane injuries arising under both physiological and pathological conditions ( e . g . , cytolysins secreted by immune cells and bacteria ) [ 37 , 88 , 109 , 114 ] . Here , pore - injured membrane regions are internalized and targeted for lysosomal degradation ; however , a recent study questioned the direct implication of endocytosis in pore removal and instead suggested that endocytic mechanisms regulate membrane composition and in - plane ten - sion in response to pore - mediated injuries [ 115 ] . Regardless of the exact role of exocytosis - and endocytosis - mediated repair , the underlying mechanisms share the requirement for delicate modulation of actin cytoskeletal dynamics in order to aid efﬁcient vesicle fusion and ﬁssion during single - cell wound repair . 2 . 2 . 3 . Blebbing - Mediated Plasma Membrane Repair The formation of PM blebs ( cytoplasmic spherical protrusions only connected to the cell body through a thin neck ) resembles a reversed and unﬁnished form of endocytosis . Blebbing arises from disrupted PM – cytoskeleton interactions , which permit actomyosin contraction independent of the membrane , which instead becomes inﬂated through intra - cellular osmotic pressure [ 116 , 117 ] . There is some discrepancy regarding the underlying mechanism ( s ) of blebbing , as some studies have reported bleb formation to be driven by Ca 2 + - dependent actin depolymerization [ 37 , 118 ] , while others have argued that it is a Ca 2 + - independent passive process , resulting from the formation of spatially organized lipid domains in response to toxin oligomerization [ 119 , 120 ] . Likewise , the purpose of blebbing has been debated , arising to compartmentalize pores ( protecting the cell from Ca 2 + toxicity and loss of cytosolic content ) as a prerequisite for membrane restructuring through mi - croparticle shedding or for cortical actin regeneration ( see Section 3 . 2 ) [ 37 , 117 , 118 , 121 – 123 ] . Mechanistically , annexins , especially ANXA1 , are key proteins in bleb formation because of their Ca 2 + sensitivity , PS - binding domain and oligomerization properties , through which they can mediate membrane fusion [ 1 , 124 ] . Supportive of such a role , mass spectrometry analysis conﬁrmed the presence of annexins inside shed blebs [ 125 ] . Alternatively , local actin reassembly within blebs can drive myosin II - dependent bleb retraction through a RhoA - ROCK - Rho family GTPase 3 ( RND3 ) feedback loop [ 117 , 126 – 128 ] , suggesting that blebbing could be involved in cortical actin cytoskeletal remodeling following PM injury . Regardless of discrepancies related to its underlying mechanism and role , the involve - ment of blebbing in PM repair is undeniable . A better understanding of actin dynamics during blebbing could provide a mechanistic and functional understanding of blebbing in PM repair and cytoskeletal restructuring . At the same time , studying the different stages of blebbing could perhaps provide insights into the sequence of events contributing to cortical actin cytoskeleton de - and reassembly . 3 . Cortical Actin Dynamics in Membrane Restructuring PM repair needs to occur within a sub - second window to ensure cell survival ; hence , it comes at a cost , namely that it is crude and often unable to sustain complete PM func - tion . As such , the resealed membrane and underlying cytoskeleton need to undergo extensive restructuring to reestablish membrane integrity [ 2 , 18 , 20 , 92 ] . The instrumental role of actin cytoskeletal dynamics in driving post - injury PM restructuring has received increasing attention in recent years and has resulted in novel insights into actin - driven membrane restructuring . Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 10886 9 of 16 3 . 1 . Macropinocytosis - Mediated Membrane Restructuring We recently revealed that MCF7 breast carcinoma cells undergo a form of injury - triggered macrointernalization , termed light - chain 3 ( LC3 ) - associated macropinocytosis , in which cells restructure their PM by internalizing large portions of damaged membrane [ 129 ] . Subsequent to membrane resealing , buildup of actin around the injury site results in the formation of actin - rich membrane protrusions . Here , the actin - driven extension of PM rufﬂes generates cup - like structures , which close to form large macropinosomes .

Macropinocytosis ‐ Mediated Membrane Restructuring We recently revealed that MCF7 breast carcinoma cells undergo a form of injury ‐ triggered macrointernalization , termed light ‐ chain 3 ( LC3 ) ‐ associated macropinocytosis , in which cells restructure their PM by internalizing large portions of damaged membrane [ 129 ] . Subsequent to membrane resealing , buildup of actin around the injury site results in the formation of actin ‐ rich membrane protrusions .

Plasma Membrane Repair Facilitated by Microparticle Shedding Microparticle or ectosome shedding comprises an alternative PM repair mechanism for the removal of pore ‐ injured membrane regions in response to damage . Shedding , also known as ectocytosis , is capable of repairing both small ( < 100 nm ) and large ( micron ‐ scale ) membrane injuries , via the ESCRT ‐ III complex or annexin proteins [ 123 , 130 – 133 ] . ESCRT ‐ III ‐ mediated shedding is initiated by Ca 2 + influx resulting from pore ‐ related membrane permeabilization , which triggers the formation of apoptosis ‐ linked gene ‐ 2 ( ALG ‐ 2 ) ‐ ANXA7 complexes that become tethered to the injured membrane through the PS ‐ binding domain of ANXA7 [ 19 ] . Here , ALG ‐ 2 ‐ ANXA7 recruits ALG ‐ 2 interacting protein X ( ALIX ) , which in turn promotes the sequential recruitment of ESCRT ‐ III components driving complex assembly of a spiral ‐ shaped structure capable of shedding the damaged membrane through spiral ‐ mediated contraction ( Figure 1H ) [ 130 , 131 ] . F ‐ actin ‐ driven formation of filopodia ‐ like protrusions were found to act as scaffolds for microparticle shedding in HeLa cervical cancer cells , a process that was dependent on Figure 3 .

Plasma Membrane Repair Facilitated by Microparticle Shedding Microparticle or ectosome shedding comprises an alternative PM repair mechanism for the removal of pore - injured membrane regions in response to damage . Shedding , also known as ectocytosis , is capable of repairing both small ( < 100 nm ) and large ( micron - scale ) membrane injuries , via the ESCRT - III complex or annexin proteins [ 123 , 130 – 133 ] . ESCRT - III - mediated shedding is initiated by Ca 2 + inﬂux resulting from pore - related membrane permeabilization , which triggers the formation of apoptosis - linked gene - 2 ( ALG - 2 ) - ANXA7 complexes that become tethered to the injured membrane through the PS - binding domain of ANXA7 [ 19 ] . Here , ALG - 2 - ANXA7 recruits ALG - 2 interacting pro - tein X ( ALIX ) , which in turn promotes the sequential recruitment of ESCRT - III components driving complex assembly of a spiral - shaped structure capable of shedding the damaged membrane through spiral - mediated contraction ( Figure 1H ) [ 130 , 131 ] . F - actin - driven formation of ﬁlopodia - like protrusions were found to act as scaffolds for microparticle shedding in HeLa cervical cancer cells , a process that was dependent on myosin 1A and ECSRT - III component vacuolar protein sorting - associated protein 4B ( Vps4B ) [ 134 ] . Mem - brane protrusions occurred 10 – 15 min post - injury , suggesting that shedding does not partake in the acute repair phase , but instead facilitates subsequent membrane and cy - Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 10886 10 of 16 toskeletal restructuring . Scaffold construction was mediated by the relocation of actin from neighboring regions to the injury site in a process that was dependent on F - actin nucleation by N - WASP and myosin 1A [ 134 ] . Local actin depolymerization at these ﬁlopodia - like pro - trusions may prime shedding - mediated restructuring by causing membrane deformation , thereby favoring vesicle formation of the unsupported membrane . Previous studies have demonstrated compound - induced actin modulation to induce shedding in different cell types [ 135 – 137 ] . Alternatively , membrane - binding proteins capable of sensing or inducing high mem - brane curvature , such as annexins , could perhaps in cooperation with local actin remodeling prime shedding - mediated membrane restructuring . Blebbing is the most likely priming mechanism . As such , Ca 2 + inﬂux can trigger the sequential recruitment and binding of ANXA1 , ANXA2 and ANXA6 , with the recruitment kinetics depending on the Ca 2 + sensitivity of the individual annexins [ 123 , 132 , 133 ] . Annexin binding seals damaged mem - brane regions . Next , both the damaged membrane regions and the annexins are shed from the cell as microparticles [ 123 , 132 , 133 ] . Overall , annexin - and ESCRT - III - mediated microparticle shedding require the same form of cytoskeletal remodeling , as observed in exocytosis - mediated PM repair , since microparticle shedding is an exovesicular process . Interestingly , syntaxin - 2 ( SYX - 2 ) interacts with epithelial fusion failure 1 ( EFF - 1 ) to facilitate PM repair downstream of ESCRT - III in C . elegans [ 138 ] , suggesting that the SYX - 2 - EFF - 1 repair machinery is likely involved in late - stage repair important for reestablishing membrane integrity . In agreement with such a role , the SYX - 2 - EFF - 1 repair machinery was demonstrated to be required for successful membrane repair and animal survival , thereby potentially adding an additional layer to repair - mediated membrane restructuring . Early actin polymerization and Ca 2 + - regulated ESCRT - III signaling were shown to promote the sequential recruitment of SYX - 2 and EFF - 1 to the injury site , once again highlighting the instrumental role of cortical actin cytoskeletal dynamics in late - stage membrane repair and restructuring . 4 . Perinuclear Actin Dynamics Mechanosensing describes the ability of a cell to sense mechanical stimuli from the extracellular milieu [ 139 ] . The cytoskeleton is the primary facilitator of mechanotransduc - tion , as tension levels within the cells are mediated by the cytoskeletal system . Cytoskeletal tension force can activate molecular sensors , and in this way initiate intracellular signal - ing cascades , resulting in an orchestrated cellular response towards the imposed stimuli . Intriguingly , a novel actin structure has been shown to form in the perinuclear region in response to mechanical stimuli and biochemical signals related to mechanotransduc - tion [ 140 , 141 ] . Force - induced perinuclear actin remodeling could be considered a cellular attempt to protect the nucleus against mechanical - induced ruptures . F - actin accumulation in the perinuclear region occurs rapidly ( < 1 min ) in response to stimuli and was found to be dependent on Ca 2 + inﬂux , calcium regulator calmodulin and actin polymerization factor inverted formin - 2 ( IFN2 ) [ 140 , 141 ] . Interestingly , wound healing in Dictyostelium cells following laserporation was also shown to depend on Ca 2 + inﬂux , calmodulin and subsequent actin polymerization [ 42 ] . The shared repair toolkit raises the question as to whether perinuclear actin remodeling is not limited to mechanosensing , but may also be involved in nuclear envelope repair . ESCRT - III has been reported to facilitate nuclear envelope repair [ 142 ] , further supporting a potential overlap between PM and nuclear envelope repair mechanisms . 5 . Conclusions Actin was originally believed to be sufﬁcient to mediate single - cell wound repair , but a growing body of evidence suggests that repair of larger wounds requires the assistance of specialized repair machinery . This previously redirected the focus from actin cytoskeletal dynamics in wound repair in favor of dedicated repair proteins and mechanisms ; however , the function of actin as an evolutionarily conserved facilitator of membrane resealing Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 10886 11 of 16 and restructuring is undeniable and has been understudied in recent times . Especially when considering the growing appreciation for the role of membrane restructuring in cell health , mechanistic insight into cortical actin dynamics during membrane restructuring is lacking and is of therapeutic value . For the sake of clarity , this review has distinguished between immediate membrane resealing and restructuring , although in reality , they are cooperative phases of the same tandem repair process . This interconnectivity is exempliﬁed by the occasional mechanistic overlap between membrane resealing and restructuring ; for example , blebbing and shedding have been proposed to partake in both immediate repair , membrane restructuring and cortical actin regeneration , highlighting the need for both membrane and cytoskeletal restructuring . Taken together , the cortical actin cytoskeleton is not merely a passive bystander in single - cell wound repair , but an active and dynamic player given that essentially all PM repair mechanisms are directly or indirectly dependent on cortical actin cytoskeletal remodeling .
