Arising from a common ancestral ! - actinin gene through duplica - tions and rearrangements , the family has increased to include the spec - trins and dystrophin / utrophin . The spectrin family is characterized by the presence of spectrin repeats , actin binding domains , and EF hands . With increasing divergence , new domains and functions have been added such that spectrin and dystrophin also contain specialized protein - protein inter - action motifs and regions for interaction with membranes and phospholi - pids . The acquisition of new domains also increased the functional complexity of the family such that the proteins perform a range of tasks way beyond the simple bundling of actin ﬁlaments by ! - actinin in S . pombe . We discuss the evolutionary , structural , functional , and regulatory roles of the spectrin family of proteins and describe some of the disease traits associated with loss of spectrin family protein function .

I ntroduction The eukaryotic cytoskeletal network is formed from a number of ﬁ lamen - tous systems composed of polymers of actin , tubulin , or intermediate ﬁ la - ment proteins . The actin stress ﬁ bers , microtubules , and intermediate ﬁ laments generated are integrated in a highly organized manner that can be both dynamic as well as stable . The ﬁ lamentous state and organization of these proteins provides the cell with an internal scaffold essential to many cellular processes , including mechanical strength , cellular morphology , adhesion , motility , intracellular traf ﬁ cking , cell division , and networks for inter - and intracellular communication . The cytoskeletal network allows rapid remodeling in response to altered mechanical needs facilitated by the dynamic exchange of protein subunits within the system , and by the manner in which the network is linked through crosslinking proteins . Signi ﬁ cant contributors to cell structure are those proteins that cross - link actin ﬁ laments or connect actin ﬁ laments to the cell membrane . Examples of such proteins can be found within the spectrin superfamily of cytoskeletal proteins . This discrete group is principally composed of the actin crosslinking protein ! - actinin , and the membrane - associated actin - binding proteins spectrin and dystrophin . The spectrin family of proteins is highly modular and share common structural elements including a calponin homology ( CH ) domain contain - ing an actin - binding domain , spectrin repeats , EF hands , and various other signaling domains and motifs ( Fig . 1 ) . The spectrin family of proteins arose from work that originally focused on understanding the role that spectrin played biochemically in the organization and assembly of the cytoskeleton ( reviewed in Gratzer , 1985 ) . Spectrin possesses the ability to self assemble , but the molecular basis of this process could not be explained until more was known about the sequence and , ultimately , the structure of the protein . The work of Speicher and Marchesi ( 1984 ) provided the protein sequence of almost half of the ! - spectrin chain . This work identi ﬁ ed spectrin as being a highly modular protein composed of many repeating 106 - amino - acid units . The helical nature of these units was predicted to form triple - helical coiled - coil bundles that were dubbed spectrin repeats . Continued investigation and DNA sequencing led to the determination of several ! - spectrin sequences from erythrocyte , Drosophila , and brain ( Dubreuil et al . , 1989 ; Sahr et al . , 1990 ; Wasenius et al . , 1989 ) . It was around this time that the DNA sequences of the related proteins ! - actinin and dystrophin were completed ( Baron et al . , 1987 ; Koenig et al . , 1988 ) . These proteins were found to contain repeating units similar to those found in spectrin ( Davison and Critchley , 1988 ) and , hence , the spectrin family of proteins was born . 204 BRODERICK AND WINDER The sequencing of ! - and " - spectrin , ! - actinin , and dystrophin has revealed similarities not only within the spectrin repeat , but also the other domains and motifs present within these proteins . Subsequent analyses have revealed an evolutionary pathway for the divergence of spectrin and dystrophin from a common ! - actinin ancestor via a series of rearrange - ments , duplications , and evolution of repeats and other domains , as well as the acquisition of unique domains such as PH , WW , and SH3 ( Fig . 2 ) . II . E volution The availability of complete sequences for ! - actinin , spectrin , and dystrophin has allowed the ancestry and evolution of the proteins to be traced . Multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees have been F ig . 1 . Structure of spectrin superfamily proteins . Modular domains within each protein are clearly de ﬁ ned . Shaded spectrin repeats represent coiled coils involved in dimerization events ; incomplete repeats represent proportionally the number of coiled - coil helices contributed by ! - and " - spectrin when generating a complete spectrin repeat during formation of the spectrin tetramer . The dashed lines indicate how two spectrin heterodimers interact to form a functional spectrin tetramer . Asterisks in the dystrophin spectrin repeats represent the position of the two greater repeats in dystrophin with respect to utrophin , which in all other respects has a similar overall structure . Numbers in the EF hand regions represent the number of EF hand motifs . SPECTRIN , ! - ACTININ , AND DYSTROPHIN 205 combined with precise alignment of equivalent domains within each protein to provide details of the relationships that exist between each of the protein domains . Analysis of the amino acid sequences from ! - actinin , spectrin , and dystrophin suggested that all three of the protein families have arisen from a common ancestral protein that was similar to ! - actinin ( Byers et al . , 1992 ; Dubreuil , 1991 ) via a series of gene duplications and gene rearrangements ( Baines , 2003 ; Pascual et al . , 1997 ; Thomas et al . , 1997 ; Viel , 1999 ) . One of the diagnostic features of the spectrin superfamily of proteins is the presence of the 106 – 120 repetitive unit referred to as the spectrin repeat ( Speicher and Marchesi , 1984 ) . Sequence comparisons sug - gest that all three of these proteins share signi ﬁ cant homology within their F ig . 2 . Evolution of the spectrin superfamily . Rounded rectangles represent spectrin repeats . Shaded rectangles denote ! - actinin - like repeats involved in dimerization , whereas unshaded rectangles represent repeats that were involved in duplication and / or elongation events . The incomplete spectrin repeats involved in tetramer formation are proportionally represented depending on the number of repeat helices each protein contributes to the formation of a complete spectrin repeat . ( Adapted from Dubreuil , 1991 ; Pascual et al . , 1997 . ) A dystrophin / utrophin ancestor probably diverged from ! - actinin at a relatively early stage and then underwent its own series of duplications and acquisitions of new motifs . 206 BRODERICK AND WINDER N - terminal actin - binding domains and in the spectrin repeats that form the rod domains ( Davison and Critchley , 1988 ) . The spectrin repeats are found in distinct multiples in each protein , resulting in a characteristic actin crosslinking distance . ! - Actinin contains four repeats , " - spectrin contains 17 , ! - spectrin contains 20 , and dystrophin contains 24 . The sequences of some spectrin repeats of ! - and " - spectrin are similar in many ways to the four repeats present in ! - actinin ( Dubreuil , 1991 ) . Within the cell , ! - actinin and spectrin dimerize , although the spectrins interact further to generate a functional tetramer ( Fig . 1 ) . Most notable is that the ends of the native spectrin tetramer involved in the dimerization event show remarkable similarity to the rod domain repeats of ! - actinin that also mediate dimer formation . Indeed , homologous regions of all of the ! - actinin protein domains can be found within the sequences of ! - and " - spectrin . For example , the amino and carboxy terminal regions of ! - actinin resemble the N - terminus of " - spectrin and the C - terminus of ! - spectrin , respectively ( Byers et al . , 1989 ; Dubreuil et al . , 1989 ) . Phylogenetic analysis shows a common ances - tor for the ﬁ rst repeat of ! - actinin and the ﬁ rst repeat of " - spectrin . Similarly , each of the remaining repeats in ! - actinin ( 2 – 4 ) correspond to repeats 1 and 2 of " - spectrin and repeats 19 and 20 of ! - spectrin respectively ( Fig . 2 ) . This may have relevance for the function of these repeats in the dimerization of these proteins ( Pascual et al . , 1997 ) . It is the similarity between these regions of ! - actinin , the spectrins , and the sim - pler domain organization of ! - actinin that have led to the hypothesis that these two protein families have evolved from an ! - actinin - like precursor . Spectrin is a much more elongated protein compared to ! - actinin due to the additional number of repeats . The additional repeats are more closely related to one another than repeats common to both ! - actinin and spectrin . The spectrin repeat sequences are the most divergent in dystro - phin and its homologue utrophin ( Winder et al . , 1995a ) , most likely re ﬂ ecting an earlier divergent event when compared to spectrin ( Pascual et al . , 1997 ) . The additional molecular length of spectrin compared to the ancestral ! - actinin is believed to have arisen through two major duplication events containing blocks of seven repeats ( Pascual et al , 1997 ) . The beginning of the process can be described as the elongation of ! - actinin by insertion of a seven - repeat block between the second and third ! - actinin repeats . That block of repeats was then duplicated and an ancestor of the tetrameriza - tion repeat was inserted between the blocks ( Pascual et al . , 1997 ) ( Fig . 2 ) . Overall , the two - stage evolution of the superfamily is believed to have involved an initial dynamic phase involving intragenic duplications and concerted evolution , followed by a stable phase where repeat numbers SPECTRIN , ! - ACTININ , AND DYSTROPHIN 207 became constant and their sequences evolved independently ( Thomas et al . , 1997 ) . The ﬁ rst phase of evolution resulted in the ! - actinin , spectrin , and dystrophin lineages via a series of duplication events . This process gave rise to the necessary repeat lengths and numbers within the spectrin and dystrophin lineages . The ! - actinin lineage continued to evolve . Phy - logenetic analysis has indicated that the different isoforms found today in modern vertebrates arose after the vertebrate urochordate split , with the muscle and nonmuscle isoforms evolving separately ( Virel and Backman , 2004 ) . Thomas and colleagues ( 1997 ) hypothesized that , during a transi - tion period , the new genes began to acquire distinct crosslinking distances and that subsequent selection against longer or shorter proteins would result in a stabilization of protein length . The current length of spectrin repeats is evidently very stable , as there has been little change since the split of the arthropod vertebrate lineages . III . S tructure The spectrin superfamily is an important group of cytoskeletal proteins involved in many functions requiring crosslinking , bundling , or binding to ﬁ lamentous actin . Each of the proteins within this family differs greatly in its speci ﬁ c biological function . However , they all share a surprising level of structural homology . The members of this protein family are composed of a number of conserved domains : spectrin repeats , CH domain contain - ing actin - binding domains , EF hands , calcium - binding motifs , and various signaling domains ( Fig . 1 ) . The actin - binding domain ( ABD ) is the most N - terminal domain and can be found in ! - actinin , " - spectrin , dystrophin , and utrophin , but not ! - spectrin . The presence of the ABD allows these proteins to interact with F - actin in a variety of different cellular situations . The ABDs of these proteins comprise a tandem pair of CH domains , although the manner in which this domain interacts with F - actin is still unclear even after extensive investigation and modeling . The spectrin repeats form the rod domains of these proteins . There are four repeats in ! - actinin and between 17 and 24 in spectrin and dystrophin . In general , the spectrin repeats are responsible for the overall length of the protein and they are usually recognized as modules for the generation of elongat - ed molecules and the separation of the speci ﬁ c N - and C - terminal domains ( Winder , 1997 ) . Overall , the core structures of the spectrin repeats from each family member are very similar , although the size of the repeating regions differs slightly . In ! - actinin , repeats are 122 residues in length , and 106 residues in length for spectrin ; in dystrophin and utrophin , the repeating units are 109 residues in length . Within the spectrin family proteins , each member contains a differing number of repeating 208 BRODERICK AND WINDER elements . The four repeats in ! - actinin are separated from the ABD by a linker that allows a signi ﬁ cant degree of ﬂ exibility between the rigid rod and the ABD . In the functional ! - actinin dimer , it is the spectrin repeats that are responsible for the dimerization . Crystal structures of the dimeric ! - actinin rod domain have found that the rod bends slightly along its length , but also the whole domain twists through approximately 90 de - grees . In conjunction with the rod domain and ABD , the ﬂ exible linker that separates them contributes to ! - actinin ’ s ability to crosslink actin ﬁ laments that are oriented in either a parallel or antiparallel manner ( Ylanne et al . , 2001a ) . The rod domains of ! - and " - spectrin are composed of 20 and 17 spectrin repeats , respectively . At the N - terminus of ! - spectrin , the ﬁ rst repeating segment begins with the ‘‘ third helix ’’ of what will become a complete triple - helical coiled - coil structure , analogous to a spectrin repeat when it interacts with the two helices that are found at the C - terminus of " - spectrin ( Fig . 1 ) . This site allows the spectrin dimer to interact with another dimer to form a spectrin heterodimer or tetramer . This is the functional unit of spectrin within the erythrocyte . It has been shown that speci ﬁ c repeats in both ! - and " - spectrin are not just present as structural modules that contribute to the length of the rod domain . Repeat 10 of ! - spectrin has been found to be slightly shorter than a typical spectrin repeat and shows substantial homology to the SH3 domain of the Src protein family ( Wasenius et al . , 1989 ) , whereas repeat 15 of " - spectrin has been found to be responsible for interaction with ankyrin ( Kennedy et al . , 1991 ) . The two most C - terminal spectrin repeats of ! - spectrin ( 21 and 22 ) and the ﬁ rst two of " - spectrin ( 1 and 2 ) once again show differences in sequence and structure from a typical spectrin repeat . This particular section of ! - spectrin shows homology with the C - terminus of ! - actinin , whereas repeats 1 and 2 of " - spectrin share homology with the N - terminus . It has been found that these repeats are responsible for the dimerization of ! - and " - spectrin in a manner analogous to the four spectrin repeats of the ! - actinin rod domain ( reviewed in Winkelmann and Forget , 1993 ) . The rod domains of dystrophin and its close relative utrophin have not been found to mediate dimerization . It seems that the spectrin repeats of these two proteins function primarily to separate the N - and C - termini . However , it should be noted that the rod domains of dystrophin and utrophin are able to associate with ﬁ lamentous actin , although the man - ner of interaction differs for each protein ( Amann et al , 1999 ; Rybakova et al . , 2002 ) . The C - termini of spectrin family proteins also exhibit a variety of structural similarities including motifs involved in protein - protein interac - tions ( Fig . 1 ) . EF - hands motifs are found in all but " - spectrin . The SPECTRIN , ! - ACTININ , AND DYSTROPHIN 209 function of this domain is most notable in ! - actinin , where the binding of calcium is able to affect the interaction of the ABD with F - actin . This is only the case though for the nonmuscle isoforms of ! - actinin , as the muscle isoforms are calcium insensitive ( Blanchard et al . , 1989 ) . The C - terminus of ! - spectrin has also been found to contain EF hands similar to those of ! - actinin . It is believed that these structures may play a role in modulating the functional conformation of the " - spectrin ABD when N - and C - termini are juxtaposed in the spectrin heterodimers . The EF hands of dystrophin have been predicted to be unable to bind calcium , although it is thought that they have an important structural role ( Huang et al . , 2000 ) . Finally , a number of smaller motifs have been found at or within the C - termini of these proteins . The nonerythroid form of " - spectrin has been shown to possess a pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domain at its C - terminus . This fold is conserved in proteins that can interact with phospholipids and may allow direct interaction with the cell membrane . The remainder of the motifs are found within the C - terminus of dystro - phin and utrophin . These motifs consist of WW and ZZ domains that , together with the EF - hand region , form the cysteine - rich region . The WW domain is an example of a protein - protein interaction module that binds proline - rich sequences ( Ilsley et al . , 2002 ) , whereas the ZZ domain is a zinc ﬁ nger motif also involved in mediating protein - protein interactions ( Ponting et al . , 1996 ) . At the extreme C - terminus of dystrophin and utrophin are two helices predicted to form dimeric coiled - coils ( Blake et al . , 1995 ) that mediate interaction with the dystrophin family proteins dystrobrevin and DRP2 . IV . F unction Spectrin is a common component of the submembranous cytoskeleton . It was ﬁ rst identi ﬁ ed as a major constituent of the erythrocyte membrane cytoskeleton , but has since been found in many other vertebrate tissues as well as in the nonvertebrates Drosophila , Acanthamoeba , Dictyostelium , and echinoderms ( Bennett and Condeelis , 1988 ; Byers et al . , 1992 ; Dubreuil et al . , 1989 ; Pollard , 1984 ; Wessel and Chen . , 1993 ) . The ease with which spectrin could be isolated from erythrocyte ghosts made it an ideal candi - date for the study of the biochemical processes involved in the assembly and organization of the cytoskeleton ( Gratzer , 1985 ) . The human erythrocyte possesses a characteristic biconcave shape and remarkable viscoelastic properties . Electron microscopy studies per - formed on red blood cells ( RBC ) , ghosts , and skeletons revealed a two - dimensional lattice of cytoskeletal proteins . This meshwork of pro - teins was thought to determine the elastic properties of the RBC . This 210 BRODERICK AND WINDER notion was supported further when it was found that detergent - extracted skeletons exhibited shape memory ; since spectrin was the major constitu - ent of these skeletons , it was suggested that it was responsible for the elastic properties . The protein lattice that laminates the inner surface of the erythrocyte membrane is formed from interactions between actin , spectrin , and integral membrane proteins ( Bennett and Gilligan , 1993 ) . The lattice is predominantly formed from ! - and " - spectrin dimers that again dimerize to generate tetramers roughly 200 nm in length . Five or six of these tetramers bind through their tail ends to a junctional complex , consisting of ﬁ lamentous actin and band 4 . 1 ( reviewed in Winkelmann and Forget , 1993 ) . The molecular function of the complete spectrin heterodimer relies on the inter - and intramolecular interactions that occur at two key points within the spectrin molecule . These associations take place at the head end , where interchain binding between ! - and " - spectrin gives rise to a heterodimer or the tetramer . The tail end of the molecule contains sites responsible for the interchain binding between spectrin chains integrating spectrin tetramers into a network via interac - tions with actin , protein 4 . 1 , and other binding partners . Between the head and tail regions of the molecule , much of the overall length of spectrin is attributed to the number of spectrin repeats , 20 repeats for ! - spectrin and 17 repeats for " - spectrin . The spectrin tetramers associate with short actin oligomers to form a regular repeating polygonal lattice . This network is coupled to the membrane via a limited number of direct and indirect contacts between spectrin and integral membrane proteins . These attachments consist of interactions between ankyrin and band 3 protein , and between protein 4 . 1 and glycophorin C . ! - Actinin is the smallest member of the spectrin family of proteins ( Pascual et al . , 1997 ) . It was ﬁ rst described as an actin crosslinker in skeletal muscle , but has subsequently been found to be ubiquitously expressed ( Otto , 1994 ) . Additional family members have been found in smooth muscle and nonmuscle cells ( Blanchard et al . , 1989 ) and are localized at the leading edge , cell adhesion sites , focal contacts , and along actin - stress ﬁ bers in migrating cells ( Knight et al . , 2000 ) . The functional unit of ! - actinin is an antiparallel homodimer of polypeptide chain mass of 94 – 103 kDa ( Blanchard et al . , 1989 ) , in which the amino - terminal CH domains together with the carboxy - terminal calmodulin ( CaM ) ho - mology domain form the actin - binding heads of the molecule ( Critchley , 2000 ) . The connection between these two heads is composed of four spectrin repeats , which de ﬁ ne the distance between the actin ﬁ laments that are crosslinked . ! - Actinin has three main biological functions . It is the major thin ﬁ lament crosslinking protein in the muscle Z - discs , where it holds the adjacent sarcomeres together ( Masaki et al . , 1967 ) . ! - Actinin is SPECTRIN , ! - ACTININ , AND DYSTROPHIN 211 also found close to the plasma membrane where it crosslinks cortical actin to integrins ( Otey et al . , 1990 ) and serves as a linker between transmem - brane receptors and the cytoskeleton . In nonmuscle cells , ! - actinin is a major component of stress ﬁ bers , an analogous contractile structure to the more organized units found in striated muscle ( reviewed by Otey and Carpen , 2004 ) . ! - Actinin is also a constituent of dense bodies ( Lazarides and Burridge , 1975 ) , which are believed to be structurally and functionally analogous to the sarcomere Z - disk . Dystrophin is the product of the largest known gene within the human genome , spanning approximately 2 . 5 Mb of genomic sequence and com - posed of 79 exons ( Coffey et al . , 1992 ; Roberts et al . , 1993 ) . The protein product encoded by the transcript of this gene is known as dystrophin , and the absence of this protein results in Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( Koenig et al . , 1987 ) . Dystrophin is predominantly expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle but small amounts are found in the brain . These full - length isoforms are under the control of three independently regulated promoters referred to as brain , muscle , and Purkinje , the names of which re ﬂ ect the site at which dystrophin expression is driven . Additionally , four internal promoters give rise to truncated C - terminal isoforms , and alter - native splicing further increases the number of isoforms and variants . The spectrin repeats form the bulk of the protein ( Fig . 1 ) and are thought to allow ﬂ exibility and give the molecule a rodlike structure . Dystrophin can be found associated with the plasma membrane of cardiac and skeletal muscle , where it interacts with the integral membrane protein dystrogly - can that binds to laminin on the extracellular face . The dystrophin - dys - troglycan complex further interacts with the integral membrane sarcoglycan proteins and peripheral membrane proteins syntrophin and dystrobrevin , which together comprise the dystrophin glycoprotein com - plex ( reviewed in Winder et al . , 1995a ) . This complex of proteins can then interact with F - actin via the N - terminus of dystrophin to form a ﬂ exible link between the basal lamina of the extracellular matrix and the internal cytoskeletal network ( Campbell and Kahl , 1989 ; Rando , 2001 ) . It is be - lieved that this complex serves to stabilize the sarcolemma and protect muscle ﬁ bers from contraction - induced damage . Indeed , the absence or mutation of dystrophin results in the X - linked myopathies Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies ( DMD and BMD , respectively ; reviewed in Blake et al . , 2002 ) . Within the skeletal musculature , dystrophin plays an important role in maintaining the integrity of the sarcolemmal membrane . Dystrophin is not able to perform this task alone and interacts with a number of other proteins that include dystroglycans , sarcoglycans , dystrobrevins , syntrophins , and sarcospan ( Straub and Campbell , 1997 ) . Mutation of dystrophin or , indeed , 212 BRODERICK AND WINDER other components of this complex can result in a variety of disease pathologies . Most notable is that of DMD , where a complete absence of dystrophin is observed , resulting in progressive muscle wasting and even - tual death of the affected individual . This complex of proteins is thought to provide a link between the cortical actin cytoskeletal network and laminin in the extracellular matrix ( Ervasti and Campbell , 1993a , b ) . Hence , it is thought that dystrophin and the associated proteins provide a mechanically stabilizing role that protects the sarcolemmal membrane from the shear stresses generated during eccentric contraction of muscle ( Petrof et al . , 1993 ) . Dystrophin has been found to localize adjacent to the cytoplasmic face of the sarcolemmal membrane in regions known as costameres ( Porter et al . , 1992 ; Straub et al . , 1992 ) . These assemblies of cytoskeletal proteins are involved in linking the force - generating sarco - meric apparatus to the sarcolemmal membrane ( Craig and Pardo , 1983 ; Pardo et al . , 1983 ) . Costameres transmit contractile forces laterally through the sarcolemmal membrane to the basal lamina ( Danowski et al . , 1992 ) . It has been found that dystrophin is not required for the assembly of several of the proteins that comprise costamere - like structures , but its absence does lead to an altered costameric lattice ( Ehmer et al . , 1997 ; Minetti et al . , 1992 ; Porter et al . , 1992 ; Williams and Bloch , 1999 ) . These data suggest that dystrophin plays an important role in the organization or stability of costameres , perhaps via an interaction with actin ﬁ laments ( Rybakova et al . , 2000 ) . Rybakova and colleagues ( 2000 ) showed that the dystrophin com - plex formed a mechanically strong link between the sarcolemma and the costameric cytoskeleton through interaction with # - actin ﬁ laments . Following the discovery of the dystrophin gene , another cDNA was identi ﬁ ed that showed considerable homology to that of dystrophin ( Love et al . , 1989 ) . Initially this protein was referred to as dystrophin - related protein ( DRP ) , but once cloned and sequenced ( Tinsley et al . , 1992 ) it was subsequently renamed utrophin due to a ubiquitous expression pattern compared to that of dystrophin . In muscle cells , utrophin shares a high degree of functional similarity with dystrophin ( Claudepierre et al . , 1999 ; Earnest et al . , 1995 ; Loh et al . , 2000 ; Matsumura et al . , 1993 ; Nguyen et al . , 1991 ; Pons et al . , 1994 ; Raats et al . , 2000 ) and has been proposed as a potential therapeutic replacement for dystrophin in the treatment of DMD ( Matsumura et al . , 1992 ; Pearce et al . , 1993 ; Tinsley et al . , 1992 ) . A . Actin - Binding Domains The actin - binding domains ( ABD ) of spectrin , ! - actinin , and dystrophin consist of approximately 240 residues that comprise two functionally distinct but structurally equivalent domains ( Gimona and Winder , 1998 ; SPECTRIN , ! - ACTININ , AND DYSTROPHIN 213 Matsudaira , 1991 ) . These domains have been named calponin homology or CH domains ( Castresana and Saraste , 1995 ) based on the sequence similar - ity to the smooth muscle regulatory protein calponin ( Winder and Walsh , 1990 ) , where this domain is found only as a single copy . Compared to the single CH domain seen in calponin , the double domain found in the spectrin superfamily of proteins has been proposed to arise through a process of gene duplication ( Castresana and Saraste , 1995 ; Matsudaira , 1991 ) . Furthermore , phylogenetic analysis of CH - domain - containing pro - teins has revealed that there is a greater similarity between the N - terminal CH domains ( CH1 ) and the C - terminal CH domains ( CH2 ) in any of the classes of actin - binding proteins than between the CH domains found within the same protein ( Banuelos et al . , 1998 ; Keep et al . , 1999a ; Korenbaum and Rivero , 2002 ; Stradal et al . , 1998 ) . Some actin - binding proteins have been found to contain a single CH domain , although the binding interaction requires additional elements since the isolated CH domains from these proteins do not exhibit analogous actin binding when compared to the whole protein ( Gimona and Mital , 1998 ) . Functionally , it should be noted that characterization of bacterially expressed CH domains corresponding to the actin - binding domains of ! - actinin , dystro - phin , and utrophin were found not to be equivalent ( Way et al . , 1992 ; Winder et al . , 1995b ) . When the two CH domains are separated and then used in actin - binding experiments , it has been found that only CH1 has the ability to interact with F - actin , although the af ﬁ nity is reduced . CH2 has little or no intrinsic actin - binding activity , but it is obvious that its presence is functionally important . It has been shown that both of the CH domains are required to achieve the greatest interaction with F - actin and hence , single CH domains are not regarded as actin - binding domains per se ( Gimona and Winder , 1998 ) . The ﬁ rst crystal structures of CH domains were published in 1997 . These were the CH2 domain of spectrin ( Carugo et al . , 1997 ) and the N - terminal ABD of ﬁ mbrin , comprising two CH domains ( CH1 . 1 and CH2 . 1 ) ( Goldsmith et al . , 1997 ) . The crystal structure of the second utro - phin CH domain ( CH2 ) was later published by Keep et al . ( 1999a ) . It was not long , however , before the complete actin - binding domain of utrophin was crystallized ( Keep et al . , 1999b ) , followed closely by dystrophin ( Norwood et al . , 2000 ) . The CH domain is a compact globular domain that appears to show a high degree of structural conservation . Overall , the domain comprises four main ! - helices ( A , C , E , and G ) that are approxi - mately 11 to 18 residues in length and exhibit a roughly parallel orienta - tion . Three shorter helices ( B , D , and F ) are less regular and form lesser secondary structure elements . The structure can be considered to com - prise a number of layers . The core of the domain is formed by a parallel 214 BRODERICK AND WINDER arrangement of helices C and G , which are then sandwiched between helix E and the N - terminal helix A ( Broderick and Winder , 2002 ) . The crystal structures of CH domains from ! - actinin , dystrophin , utro - phin , ﬁ mbrin , spectrin , and plectin ( Garcia - Alvarez et al . , 2003 ) have been solved to date . These structures have given insight into certain aspects of CH domain function , but have also raised many new questions regarding the interaction of these domains with actin . The dimeric organization displayed by the crystallized utrophin and dystrophin ABDs contrasts strongly with that of the ! - actinin and the related ﬁ mbrin actin - binding domain ( K . Djinovic - Carugo , personal communication ; Goldsmith et al . , 1997 ) . When crystallized , ﬁ mbrin and ! - actinin do so as compact mono - mers , where the two CH domains fold back on themselves to form a compact globular structure . These same interfaces are involved in the dimerization seen in utrophin , except it is the CH1 and CH2 domains from separate molecules that interact . The preservation of an interface between two domains of the same or related proteins when in monomeric or oligomeric forms is known as three - dimensional domain swapping ( Schlunegger et al . , 1997 ) . Recent cryo - EM reconstructions of these domains with F - actin have not served to de ﬁ nitively resolve the mode of interaction of these proteins with F - actin . Reconstructions of ﬁ mbrin bound to F - actin have been modeled on a compact conformation ( Hanein et al . , 1998 ) and the reconstruction of utrophin with F - actin on an extend - ed conformation ( Moores et al . , 2000b ) . Electron diffraction and model - ing of the ! - actinin molecule bound to F - actin showed that the ABD could be associating as an open bilobed structure ( Tang et al . , 2001 ; Taylor and Taylor , 1993 ) . The cryo - EM reconstruction of ! - actinin with F - actin ( McGough et al . , 1994 ) , however , revealed a more globular difference density , suggesting that ! - actinin might also associate with F - actin in a manner more analogous to the compact mode of interaction seen in the ﬁ mbrin crystal structure . The helical linkers between the two CH domains of these proteins may play an important role in determining the ﬂ exibility between the two CH domains and , subsequently , the manner they interact with F - actin . Gel - ﬁ ltration studies of the utrophin ABD have shown it to be monomeric when in solution ( Winder et al . , 1995a ) . Hence , the crystal structures of the ABDs from ﬁ mbrin and utrophin may repre - sent two conformational extremes within this class of actin - binding pro - teins ( Keep et al . , 1999b ) . Several modes of interaction with F - actin have been demonstrated in cryo - EM studies with the utrophin ABD ( Galkin et al . , 2002 ) . Within the N - terminal , ABDs of three actin - binding sites ( ABS ) from spectrin superfamily proteins have been delineated ( ABS1 , ABS2 , and ABS3 ) . The ﬁ rst and third ABS have been localized to the ! 1 helix in SPECTRIN , ! - ACTININ , AND DYSTROPHIN 215 the ﬁ rst and second CH domains , respectively . These sites were originally identi ﬁ ed using synthetic peptides derived from dystrophin ( Levine et al . , 1990 , 1992 ) . The second ABS , corresponding to helices ! 5 and ! 6 in the CH1 domain , was ﬁ rst identi ﬁ ed in the Dictyostelium actin - gelation factor ABP - 120 ( Bresnick et al . , 1990 , 1991 ) . ABS2 was later identi ﬁ ed in ! - actinin using in vitro actin - binding studies with glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) fusion proteins ( Kuhlman et al . , 1992 ) . It was later recognized that the ABS sequences were not part of a fully folded globular protein and hence residues not normally involved in actin - binding may have been allowed to interact with actin . Structural approaches have begun to shed light on the mechanism by which the spectrin superfamily of proteins interacts with the cytoskeleton . Biochemical work studying the actin - binding sites of ! - actinin ( Lebart et al . , 1990 , 1993 ; McGough et al . , 1994 ; Mimura and Asano , 1987 ) and dystrophin ( Levine et al . , 1992 ) have been successful in identifying actin subdomain 1 as an important binding site for this particular class of proteins . Electron microscope reconstructions of F - actin decorated with ! - actinin ( McGough et al . , 1994 ; Tang et al . , 2001 ) reveal that actin subdomain 1 forms the major site of interaction . Helical recon - struction also revealed that these two proteins interacted with adjacent actin monomers on the long pitch helix , a site apparently shared by most F - actin binding proteins ( McGough , 1998 ) . The crystal structure of the utrophin ABD suggested an alternate model to that of the association of ﬁ mbrin with actin ( Keep et al . , 1999b ) . As utrophin crystallized as a head - to - tail dimer , each of the monomers adopted an extended conformation . This arrangement placed the pre - dicted ABSs on the surface of the protein , clearly enabling interaction with actin . The dimerization of utrophin seen in the crystal conserved the inter - CH domain interfaces , suggesting that utrophin may adopt a more com - pact conformation when in solution . To date , there is no evidence to support anything other than a monomeric conformation of utrophin when in solution , as the binding stoichiometry with actin is 1 : 1 ( Keep et al . , 1999b ; Moores and Kendrick - Jones , 2000a ; Winder , 1996 ) . However , the crystallization of utrophin as a dimer suggested that the ABDs of this protein might be ﬂ exible and allow actin - binding in an open conforma - tion , even when utrophin exists as a monomer in solution . Moores et al . ( 2000b ) developed this idea further by demonstrating a model of utro - phin - actin binding that contrasted that of ﬁ mbrin bound to actin . A pseudo - atomic model of utrophin bound to F - actin in an open conforma - tion was detailed , showing that all of the ABSs could be directly involved in the actin interaction . This mode of binding was found to create a different conformational change within actin compared to that caused by ﬁ mbrin , 216 BRODERICK AND WINDER suggesting that an induced ﬁ t mechanism involving conformational ﬂ exibility of actin and utrophin may be crucial to their interaction ( Moores et al . , 2000b ) . The validity of this model has recently been called into question ( Galkin et al . , 2003 ) , however , and alternative models have been proposed ( Galkin et al . , 2002 ) . The comparison between the previ - ously published model of ﬁ mbrin binding to actin and that of utrophin shows that both proteins possess a totally different mode of interaction even though their ABDs share sequence homology . Such a difference is likely to be related to the overall function of each protein , but the utrophin model has identi ﬁ ed an alternate means of actin association within a large family of proteins important to cellular organization . It should be noted that Moores et al . ( 2000b ) did not exclude the compact orientation in utrophin actin binding . However , their model relies on inherent protein ﬂ exibility . Indeed , models of utrophin ABDs have been generated where association with F - actin is made in a closed compact conformation ( Sutherland - Smith et al . , 2003 ) . Recent crystallographic and calorimetric studies of the plectin ABD demonstrated that while the two CH domains associate to form a closed conformation in the crystal structure , binding to F - actin induces the open conformation ( Garcia - Alvarez et al . , 2003 ) . Elucidation of spectrin ’ s interaction with actin at the molecular level , however , has been hampered by an inability to express a functional spectrin ABD in isolation . B . Spectrin Repeat Region The rod domain of ! - actinin is the shortest within this family of proteins and comprises just four spectrin - like repeats . Given the reduced length of this domain , it is feasible to assume a greater degree of rigidity , especially as the functional unit of ! - actinin is a dimer . The spectrin repeats of the rod domain are essential to the dimerization of ! - actinin . The association of the rod domains from two monomers leads to a much more stable and less ﬂ exible domain overall ( Djinovic - Carugo et al . , 2002 ) . Spectrin , dys - trophin , and the related protein utrophin all contain many more spectrin repeats that seem to play a more direct role in the cellular function of these proteins . Studies performed by Pasternak and colleagues ( 1995 ) show the sarcolemma of muscles from the mdx mouse to be four times less stiff than in controls , demonstrating directly that dystrophin and its associated proteins reinforce the stability of the sarcomere . Spectrin forms roughly 5 % of the total protein of the erythrocyte and is pivotal to the formation and function of the submembranous skeleton in red blood cells . This erythrocyte plasma membrane possesses remarkable mechanical SPECTRIN , ! - ACTININ , AND DYSTROPHIN 217 properties , more like an elastic semisolid ( Evans and Hochmuth , 1977 ) . This allows storage of energy during deformation ( e . g . , squeezing through a narrow capillary ) , but allows the erythrocyte to return to its normal shape once the deformation ceases ( see review by Bennett and Gilligan , 1993 ) . The ability of erythrocytes to survive repeated deformation is essential to their physiological function and their prolonged life within the vascula - ture . Direct evidence has determined that spectrin is the major factor in providing the elastic properties exhibited by the erythrocyte . Studies of erythrocytes from patients suffering from hereditary spherocytosis clearly demonstrate this ( Waugh and Agre , 1988 ) , as reduced quantities of spectrin result in a greater extent of clinical severity and a reduction in the force required to deform the affected erythrocytes ( Agre et al . , 1985 , 1986 ) . This perhaps results from an overall effect of the structure of the submembranous lattice on the whole , but the properties of this mesh - work of proteins can be linked to the properties of the spectrin repeats found within the rod domain . For many cytoskeletal and adhesion pro - teins , the ability to survive extension and deformability is pivotal to their role in a cellular environment . Atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) has been employed to examine the extensibility of spectrin repeats ( Rief et al . , 1999 ) . These studies have determined that the ! - helical spectrin repeat can be forced to unfold in a stochastic one - domain - at - a - time fashion ( Rief et al . , 1999 ) . The availability of tandem spectrin repeat structures from nonerythroid ! - spectrin ( Grum et al . , 1999 ) and the four repeat rod domain of ! - actinin ( Ylanne et al . , 2001a ) have shown that individual spectrin repeats should not be considered as such , and that the interspectrin repeat links are actually formed from contiguous helices rather than ﬂ exible linkers ( Law et al . , 2003 ) . This has implications for the manner that spectrin repeats respond to mechanical stress , inasmuch as the repeats within the rod domain do not unfold one at a time . Rather , they are subject to a cooper - ative manner of forced unfolding ( Law et al . , 2003 ) . Helical linkers be - tween spectrin repeats have been implicated to help explain the extensibility and elasticity observed within the erythrocyte cytoskeleton . The unfolding of spectrin repeats might explain thermal - softening ( Waugh and Evans , 1979 ) and strain softening of the RBC submembra - nous network ( Lee and Discher , 2001 ; Markle et al . , 1983 ) . Additionally , it has also been shown that tandem spectrin repeats are thermodynamically more stable than individual repeats and that tandem repeats unfold in unison , behaving similarly to an individual repeat ( MacDonald and Pozharski , 2001 ) . 218 BRODERICK AND WINDER The rod domains of spectrin family proteins are assumed to function solely as structural spacers that serve to separate the C - terminus from the N - terminal actin - binding domain . While this is likely to be the case for ! - actinin ( and to a certain extent in spectrin ) , natural mutations and transgenic experiments would suggest otherwise for dystrophin . It was widely thought that the rod domains of dystrophin ( and utrophin ) served as ﬂ exible spacers or shock absorbers between the actin cytoskeleton and the sarcolemmal membrane ( Winder et al . , 1995a ) . However , is the length of this ‘‘ shock absorber ’’ crucial to the function of the protein ? An individual with a large deletion in the dystrophin gene encompassing 46 % of the entire protein and 73 % of the rod region ( repeats 4 – 19 ) presented with a very mild BMD phenotype ( England et al . , 1990 ) . This would tend to suggest that rod domain length is not essential with regards to the proposed shock - absorbing role of the protein . The fact that a dystrophic phenotype is observed , regardless of how mild , would suggest that there is functional importance regarding the length of the rod domain . However , dystrophin minigenes have been designed on the basis of this shortened dystrophin and have been used to correct the dystrophic phenotype in mdx mice ( Phelps et al . , 1995 ; Wells et al . , 1995 ) . Similarly , a minispectrin has also been generated that consists of the N - terminal ABD and the ﬁ rst two spectrin repeats of " - spectrin , and the C - terminus of ! - spectrin consisting of the last two spectrin repeats and the calmodulin - like domain . This construct was still able to dimerize , bind F - actin , and induce the formation of bundles , but it is unlikely to be functional in vivo ( Raae et al . , 2003 ) . The shock - absorbing role of the spectrin repeats found within these proteins is widely accepted , which leads to the question of why there are so many coiled coils in dystrophin and utrophin . ! - Actinin contains only four spectrin repeats , which medi - ate dimerization and result in a rather in ﬂ exible link between the termini of the protein ( Ylanne et al . , 2001a ) . In this case , the length of the rod domain clearly de ﬁ nes the distance at which ﬁ lamentous actin can be crosslinked . ! - Actinin is localized to structures that require actin ﬁ laments to be crosslinked in either a parallel or antiparallel fashion . This requires the ! - actinin dimer to bind actin ﬁ laments in orientations separated by as much as 180 degrees . Furthermore , ! - actinin is able to accommodate a range of interactin ﬁ lament crosslinking distances , from 15 – 40 nm ( Liu et al . , 2004 ; Luther , 2000 ; Taylor et al . , 2000 ) . The domain is essential to the formation of the functional dimer and for the separation of the C - and N - termini of the protein , but it would seem that the ﬂ exible hinge that separates the rod from the ABD , and the ABD itself , play an important role in determining the ultimate crosslinking distance . SPECTRIN , ! - ACTININ , AND DYSTROPHIN 219 C . Other Binding Partners The repeating constituents of the rod domains of spectrin family proteins were generally regarded as modules for the construction of elongated molecules ( Winder , 1997 ) . However , this is not the only function of spec - trin repeats . It is widely accepted that proteins containing spectrin repeats are localized to cellular sites that experience signi ﬁ cant mechanical stress , and the properties of the spectrin repeat can be used to explain this functionality(cid:0) ( see(cid:0) Section(cid:0) IV . B . (cid:0) above ) . (cid:0) Additionally , (cid:0) some(cid:0) spectrin(cid:0) repeats have acquired functions with a purely structural role ; these are able to interact with a variety of structural and signaling proteins ( Djinovic - Carugo et al . , 2002 ) . The function of spectrin superfamily proteins is particularly evident when taken in context of their cellular localization . They often form ﬂ exible links or structures that allow interactions with the cellular cyto - skeletal architecture and the membrane . In both spectrin and dystrophin , such a function is performed , but the spectrin repeats of these molecules are also able to interact with actin and contribute to binding . A portion of the dystrophin rod domain that spans residues 11 – 17 contains a number of basic repeats that allow a lateral interaction with ﬁ lamentous actin ( Rybakova et al . , 2002 ) . The homologous utrophin can also interact lat - erally with actin . This interaction is distinct from that of dystrophin , as the utrophin rod domain lacks the basic repeat cluster and associates with actin via the ﬁ rst ten spectrin repeats ( Rybakova et al . , 2002 ) . " - Spectrin also exhibits an extended contact with actin via the ﬁ rst spectrin repeat . In this situation , it was found that the extended contact increased the associ - ation of the adjacent ABD with actin ( Li and Bennett , 1996 ) . In conjunc - tion with this interaction , it has been found that the second repeat is also required for maximal interaction with adducin ( Li and Bennett , 1996 ) , a protein localized at the spectrin - actin junction that is believed to contrib - ute to the assembly of this structure in the membrane skeletal network ( Gardner and Bennett , 1987 ) . In the erythrocyte cytoskeletal lattice , " - spectrin interacts with ankyrin , which in turn binds to the cytoplasmic domain of the membrane - associated anion exchanger . This indirect link to the cellular membrane occurs via repeat 15 of " - spectrin ( Kennedy et al . , 1991 ) and is largely responsible for the attachment of the spectrin - actin network to the erythrocyte membrane ( reviewed in Bennett and Baines , 2001 ) . A much larger number of direct links to transmembrane proteins have been determined for the spectrin repeats of ! - actinin ( reviewed in Djinovic - Carugo et al . , 2002 ) . The crystal structure of the ! - actinin rod domain ( Ylanne et al . , 2001a ) has allowed the analysis of surface features , leading to predictions of 220 BRODERICK AND WINDER possible protein - protein interaction sites . It was found that the most conserved surface residues were acidic in nature , which would correlate well with the relatively short basic sequences that can be found within the cytoplasmic domains of many transmembrane proteins ( Ylanne et al . , 2001b ) . ! - Actinin has been found to provide a direct link with a variety of transmembrane proteins including integrins , ICAMs , L - selectin , Ep - Cam , ADAM12 , and NMDA receptor subunits ( see Djinovic - Carugo et al . , 2002 for references ) . The ! - actinin rod domain is also involved in a number of dynamic and regulatory interactions that involve interactions with titin ( Young et al . , 1998 ) , myotilin ( Salmikangas et al . , 1999 ) , ALP ( Xia et al . , 1997 ) , and FATZ ( Faulkner et al . , 2000 ) at the Z - disk of striated muscle and interactions with Rho - kinase type protein kinase N ( PKN ) ( Mukai et al . , 1997 ) . All of these interactions occur through the rod domain of ! - actinin and demonstrate the multivariance of the rod domain as a binding site for the interactions with these proteins ( Djinovic - Carugo et al . , 2002 ) . Spectrin and dystrophin rod domains have also been demon - strated to interact directly with lipid surfaces , suggesting a lateral asso - ciation with biological membranes ( An et al . , 2004 ; DeWolf et al . , 1997 ; Le Rumeur et al . , 2003 ; Maksymiw et al . , 1987 ) . V . R egulations of I nteractions The spectrin family of proteins , depending on the particular function , has numerous smaller motifs and binding sites for interaction with other proteins . These regions are important , as they are major protein - protein or protein - membrane interaction modules that bind to F - actin , proline - containing ligands , and / or phospholipids . Spectrin and dystrophin / utro - phin have all acquired copies of such domains since their evolution from ! - actinin , presumably as a consequence of their more diverse roles in the cell . A . CH Domains The calponin homology ( CH ) domain has been identi ﬁ ed in many molecules of differing function . However , its presence usually signi ﬁ es an interaction of some sort with the actin cytoskeleton via an association with F - actin . The domain was initially identi ﬁ ed as a 100 - residue motif found at the N - terminus of the smooth muscle regulatory protein calponin and , hence , was termed the CH domain ( Castresana and Saraste , 1995 ) . The re ﬁ nement of algorithms for the identi ﬁ cation of distinct protein motifs has allowed the identi ﬁ cation of CH domains in proteins that range SPECTRIN , ! - ACTININ , AND DYSTROPHIN 221 in function from crosslinking to signaling ( Korenbaum and Rivero , 2002 ) . Despite the functional variability of this domain , the secondary structure is conserved remarkably well between proteins that contain it ( Bramham et al . , 2002 ) . Several mechanisms have been identi ﬁ ed that seem to regulate the CH domains found in spectrin , dystrophin , and ! - actinin . These range from effects induced by calcium via EF - hand motifs , PIP 2 binding , phosphory - lation , and interactions with calmodulin . The actin - binding properties of the nonmuscle isoforms of the F - actin crosslinker ! - actinin can be regulated via the presence of EF hands . Calcium does not directly regulate ! - actinin ’ s CH domains interaction with F - actin , but it does bind to the EF - hand motif present in the molecule . As ! - actinin dimerizes , this brings the CH domains and EF hands in the antiparallel dimer in close associa - tion . The conformational changes induced in the EF - hand motif can then exert an effect on the CH domains to in ﬂ uence the interaction with F - actin ( Noegel et al . , 1987 ; Tang et al . , 2001 ) . ! - Actinin has also been found to bind phosphatidylinositol ( 4 , 5 ) - bisphosphate ( PIP 2 ) at the mus - cle Z - line ( Fukami et al . , 1992 ) . The PIP 2 binding site has been deli - neated to a region immediately C - terminal of the third ABS ( Fukami et al . , 1996 ) , although the precise mechanism of control is not known for this region . It has been found , though , that in nonmuscle cells where ! - actinin is associated with actin , this region contained bound PIP 2 where - as free ! - actinin did not . This implicates a role of PIP 2 in the activation of ! - actinin - induced actin bundling ( Fukami et al . , 1994 ) . Calmodulin has also been shown to regulate the interaction of the ABDs from dystrophin ( also utrophin ) and ! - actinin by binding directly to the CH domains ( Bonet - Kerrache et al . , 1994 ; Jarrett and Foster , 1995 ; Winder et al . , 1995b ) suggesting a potential role for modulating the attachment of these proteins to the cytoskeleton . Recently , it has been shown that ! - actinin is phosphorylated by focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) and that this phosphorylation reduces the ability of ! - actinin to bind actin ( Izaguirre et al . , 2001 ) . The site of tyrosine phos - phorylation is N - terminal to the ﬁ rst CH domain in a region that is most conserved between spectrin family proteins . B . EF Hands EF - hand regions are involved in the chelation of up to two divalent calcium cations ( occasionally magnesium ) via an interaction through a paired helix - loop - helix structure ( Tufty and Kretsinger , 1975 ) . Binding of calcium to this globular domain leads to a dramatic conformational change from ‘‘ closed ’’ to ‘‘ open , ’’ exposing a hydrophobic surface that 222 BRODERICK AND WINDER binds to a target peptide , often helical in nature . However , divergent evolution has led to a subset of EF hands that no longer chelate calcium and possibly serve an alternate function ( Nakayama and Kretsinger , 1994 ) . This is exempli ﬁ ed in ! - actinin nonmuscle isoforms , where calcium is bound via the EF hands , thus allowing regulation of actin binding . The muscle - speci ﬁ c isoforms of ! - actinin have lost the ability to bind calcium through their EF hands ( Blanchard et al . , 1989 ) , possibly to protect the muscle architecture from the potential destabilizing effect of calcium during calcium - induced contractions . Spectrin has also both retained and lost the ability to bind calcium . Calcium and calmodulin bind to human nonerythroid spectrins ( ! II " II ) at sites that have either degenerated or are absent in erythroid spectrins ( ! I " I ) ( Lundberg et al . , 1992 ) . The roles of nonerythroid spectrins are far more diverse and , hence , calcium and calmodulin might participate in regulatory events not required in the erythrocyte ( Buevich et al . , 2004 ) . The EF hands of ! - spectrin are brought in close opposition with the " - spectrin ABD once the proteins form the heterodimer . The EF hand is then able to exert regulatory control over the actin - binding activity of the adjacent domain . The molecular details of how this is achieved are still to be determined , however . A similar interface is observed in ! - actinin . It is thought that the EF - hand region could engage the actin - binding do - main in a manner analogous to calmodulin binding a target peptide . Regulation of the interaction would be affected by the binding of calcium to the EF hand , which would cause a conformational change resulting in altered interaction surfaces . The calcium - binding activity of nonerythroid spectrin has been located to the two EF hands present in the C - terminus of the ! II - spectrin ( Lundberg et al . , 1995 ; Trave et al . , 1995 ) . Buevich and colleagues ( 2004 ) found that the EF hands in nonerythroid spectrin exhibited a degree of cooperativity in their binding of calcium , suggesting that EF1 binds before EF2 and modulates the af ﬁ nity of EF2 for calcium , although overall , calcium binding to ! - spectrin has been found to be much weaker than to other EF - hand - containing proteins such as troponin C and calmodulin ( Zhang et al . , 1995a ) . Each of the three EF - hand structures solved from the spectrin family proteins exhibit unique structural and functional differences , even though all are fundamentally similar . The ! - spectrin ( nonerythroid ) EF hands bind calcium and presumably perform some kind of regulatory role regarding the actin - binding function of spectrin ( Trave et al . , 1995 ) . Due to the low calcium af ﬁ nity , it is expected that calcium regulatory events involving spectrin would occur in areas of the cell that would experience a transient but signi ﬁ cant ﬂ uctuation of calcium concentra - tion ( Buevich et al . , 2004 ) . It is possible that the calcium - bound form of SPECTRIN , ! - ACTININ , AND DYSTROPHIN 223 spectrin in the cell would be stabilized by accessory proteins , as none - rythroid spectrin interacts with many proteins that are involved in regu - latory events and not just with the cytoskeleton . In muscle ! - actinin ( isoform 2 ) , the third and fourth EF hands can be referred to as ‘‘ empty ’’ on the basis of a lack of key liganding residues and large insertions in the helix - loop - helix motif . This muscle isoform of ! - actinin is important in striated muscle Z - disk structure , where it interacts with F - actin and titin . The structure of this complex was solved and showed the titin Z - repeat peptide bound in a groove formed by the partially open lobes of the two EF hands ( Atkinson et al . , 2001 ) . The EF hands of dystrophin were solved as part of a larger structure that also included the adjacent WW domain ( Huang et al . , 2000 ) . These EF hands had been predicted to be unable to bind calcium due to a lack of key liganding residues ( Winder , 1997 ) . The structure of the dystrophin WW - EF region indicated that the EF hands may play a structural role and that they are not required to bind either calcium or a target peptide ( Huang et al . , 2000 ) . It is still to be elucidated if this region of dystrophin interacts with other target peptides , but as the EF hands are oriented in a closed and compact manner , it is dif ﬁ cult to see how these interactions would occur ( Broderick and Winder , 2002 ) . Indeed , studies with constructs spanning both the WW domains and EF - hand regions of dystrophin and utrophin have failed to show any calcium - induced regulation of binding to " - dystroglycan ( James et al . , 2000 ; Rentschler et al . , 1999 ) . C . Lipid Binding Pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domains are motifs that are approximately 100 amino acids in length and have been identi ﬁ ed in over 100 different eukaryotic proteins . They are thought to participate in cell signaling and cytoskeletal regulation via interactions with phospholipids ( Lemmon and Ferguson , 1998 ; reviewed in Rebecchi and Scarlata , 1998 ) . It has been suggested that these domains function as membrane anchors and tethers , as PH domains are often found within membrane - associated proteins ( Ferguson et al . , 1995 ) . The domain was ﬁ rst recognized in 1993 ( Haslam et al . , 1993 ; Mayer et al . , 1993 ; Musacchio et al . , 1993 ) and was quickly followed by the determination of 3 - D structures . The " - spectrin PH domain structure was solved in a lipid - free ( Zhang et al . , 1995b ) and lipid - bound form ( Hyvonen et al . , 1995 ) . The role of the spectrin PH domain has been proposed to be part of the mechanism whereby spectrin associates directly with the membrane through binding phospholipids . The submembranous framework formed by spectrin is 224 BRODERICK AND WINDER linked to transmembrane polypeptides via peripheral proteins such as ankyrin and band 4 . 1 ( Viel and Branton , 1996 ) , and spectrin is essential to the integrity of this network . The PH domain of spectrin has been found to have a weak af ﬁ nity and speci ﬁ city for PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( Harlan et al . , 1994 ; Hyvonen et al . , 1995 ) . Lemmon and colleagues ( 2002 ) suggested that the " - spectrin / membrane interaction is driven by a delocalized elec - trostatic attraction between an anionic ligand and the positively charged face of the polarized PH domain . The PH domain of spectrin appears to fall into a class of PH domains that exhibit a moderate af ﬁ nity for the phosphoinositides . In cells , this polarized domain may direct a few spec - trin isoforms to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 enriched sites such as caveoli or focal adhesions ( Burridge and Chrzanowska - Wodnicka , 1996 ) , where other determinants of membrane association are likely to play an equal or more dominant role in stabilizing attachment . Although membrane attachment is not neces - sarily dependent on this domain , it has been shown that the PH domain of the human " I ! 2 spectrin isoform binds to protein - depleted membranes containing PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and to Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 in solution ( Wang and Shaw , 1995 ) . This domain localizes to plasma membranes in COS7 cells ( Wang et al . , 1996 ) . Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 binding has been found to perturb residues located in or near loop 1 of the Drosophila spectrin PH domain , as is the case for the N - terminal PH domain and the mouse form of " - spectrin ( Zhou et al . , 1995 ) . The binding site of " - spectrin has no elaborate hydrogen - bonding network and the inositol ring has no speci ﬁ c contacts with the protein , unlike the PH domain of PLC - $ 1 ( Ferguson et al . , 1995 ) . Moreover , spectrin does not bind Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 on the same face as PLC - $ 1 , whose binding pocket is located on the other side of the protein . The " - spectrin PH domain binds weakly to all phosphoinositides and is likely to associate with the negatively charged membrane surface via the positively charged face of the domain . Spectrin networks contain many spectrin molecules , and it is likely that the individual weak association with phosphoinositides is overcome by the overall collective interaction of many molecules . Such a mechanism of multivariant association allows only the assembled cytoskeletal components to interact strongly with cellular membranes , such as in the RBC . D . Polyproline Binding Domains The Src homology 3 ( SH3 ) domain of ! - spectrin was the ﬁ rst SH3 domain structure to be solved ( Musacchio et al . , 1992 ) . The domain was initially identi ﬁ ed as regions of similar sequence found within signaling proteins , such as the Src family of tyrosine kinases , the Crk adaptor SPECTRIN , ! - ACTININ , AND DYSTROPHIN 225 protein , and phospholipase C - # ( Mayer et al . , 1993 ) . In the case of spec - trin , the speci ﬁ c target ligand and function are still to be identi ﬁ ed . The domain is approximately 60 residues in length and has been identi ﬁ ed in many proteins ( Bateman et al . , 1999 ; Rubin et al . , 2000 ) . The SH3 domain continues to be identi ﬁ ed within a variety of proteins ; it is subsequently regarded as one of the most common modular protein interaction do - mains found and is widespread in signaling , adaptor , and cytoskeletal protein alike ( reviewed in Mayer , 2001 ) . Due to the small size of this domain , a search for a potential function focused on protein - protein interactions , with screening of expression libraries soon identifying seem - ingly speci ﬁ c binding partners ( Cicchetti et al . , 1992 ) . Binding studies have indicated that the interaction sites of SH3 domains were proline - rich , with PxxP being identi ﬁ ed as a core conserved binding motif ( Ren et al . , 1993 ) . It should be noted that pro ﬁ lin and WW domains also make use of a similar mode of interaction with proline - rich helical ligands ( Ilsley et al . , 2002 ; Kay et al . , 2000 ; Zarrinpar and Lim , 2000 ) . As mentioned above , the WW domain is another example of a protein - protein interaction module that binds proline - rich sequences ( Kay et al . , 2000 ) . Dystrophin and utrophin WW domains interact predominantly with the extracellular matrix receptor dystroglycan , which contains a type 1 WW motif of consensus PPxY ( reviewed in Ilsley et al . , 2002 ; Winder , 2001 ) . A structure of a WW domain from dystrophin was solved recently as part of a structure including the EF - hand region , and also with and without a bound " - dystroglycan peptide ( Huang et al . , 2000 ) . Chung and Campanelli ( 1999 ) found that the interaction between utrophin and " - dystroglycan mirrored that of dystrophin . This is mainly mediated by the WW domain , which recognizes the PPPY peptide at the carboxy terminus of " - dystroglycan . Adhesion - dependent tyrosine phos - phorylation of " - dystroglycan within the WW domain binding motif has been found to regulate the WW domain - mediated interaction between utrophin and " - dystroglycan . This was the ﬁ rst demonstration of physio - logically relevant tyrosine phosphorylation of a WW domain ligand and parallels the tyrosine phosphorylation of SH3 domain ligands regulating SH3 - mediated interactions ( James et al . , 2000 ) . Investigations performed by Rentschler et al . ( 1999 ) have also determined that the EF - hand regions following the WW domain are necessary for WW binding . It was later shown that the integrity of the utrophin WW - EF - ZZ region is essential for ef ﬁ cient binding to " - dystroglycan ( Tommasi di Vignano et al . , 2000 ) . This binding activity can be abolished in utrophin if the ZZ domain is deleted , but only a reduction in binding is observed for dystrophin ( Rentschler et al . , 1999 ) . 226 BRODERICK AND WINDER E . ZZ domain Dystrophin and its autosomal homologue utrophin contain a putative zinc ﬁ nger motif within their C - terminal cysteine - rich domains , homolo - gous to domains found in sequences of a wide variety of proteins ( Ponting et al . , 1996 ) . The ZZ domains of dystrophin and utrophin have been shown to bind zinc ( Michalak et al . , 1996 ; Winder , 1997 ) and are believed to be involved in mediating protein - protein interactions , although the precise function of the ZZ domain has not yet been elucidated . It has been found that the cysteine - rich domain of dystrophin is required for binding to " - dystroglycan ; it has been shown that the ZZ domain strengthens the interaction between the dystrophin and utrophin WW – EF region with " - dystroglycan ( James et al . , 2000 ; Jung et al . , 1995 ; Rentschler et al . , 1999 ) . More recently , Ishikawa - Sakurai and colleagues identi ﬁ ed the com - ponents of the C - terminal domain of dystrophin that are required for the full binding activity . They have detailed the extent of the C - terminal sequence ( residues 3026 – 3345 ) that is required for effective binding and have identi ﬁ ed cysteine 3340 within the ZZ domain as essential to the binding activity with " - dystroglycan ( Ishikawa - Sakurai et al . , 2004 ) . The functional importance of the ZZ domain has been proven further by the identi ﬁ cation of a rare mutation where C3340 has been mutated to a tyrosine , resulting in the affected individual suffering from a form of DMD ( Lenk et al . 1996 ) . However , to date , no structure of any ZZ domain has been solved . C - terminal to the ZZ domain is a pair of highly con - served helices predicted to form dimeric coiled - coils ( Blake et al . , 1995 ) . These helices , which are restricted to dystrophin family proteins ( dystro - phin , utrophin , DRP2 , and dystrobrevin ) , are involved in heterophilic - associations between family members and also members of the syntrophin family of proteins ( reviewed in Blake et al . , 2002 ) . VI . D isease A . Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy DMD is a severe X - linked recessive , progressive muscle wasting disease that affects approximately 1 in 3500 newborn males ( Emery , 1991 ) . An allelic variant of DMD is also known , referred to as Becker muscular dystrophy ( BMD ) . It has a later onset and lesser phenotype than DMD , resulting in longer life expectancy ( reviewed in O ’ Brien and Kunkel , 2001 ) . DMD is caused by mutations in the DMD gene that encodes the cytoskeletal linker protein dystrophin . The vast majority of DMD mutations result in the SPECTRIN , ! - ACTININ , AND DYSTROPHIN 227 complete absence of dystrophin , whereas a truncated protein is often associated with the milder Becker form of the disease ( Kingston et al . , 1983 ) . Mutations in the genes encoding other components of the dystro - phin - associated protein complex cause other forms of dystrophy , such as limb - girdle and congenital dystrophies . The cause of approximately 65 % of DMD pathologies can be traced to large deletions or duplications within the dystrophin gene . The remaining cases are the result of small insertion / deletion mutations and point mutations ( Koenig et al . , 1989 ; Monaco et al . , 1985 ; reviewed by Roberts et al . , 1994 ) . In DMD , it has been found that point mutations nearly always result in a truncation of the open reading frame causing nonsense - mediated decay , but rare cases are known where a truncated nonfunction - al protein is transcribed ( Kerr et al . , 2001 ) . In BMD , most point muta - tions disrupt splicing , which results in an intact but interstitially deleted open reading frame and a partially functional protein ( reviewed in Roberts et al . , 1994 ) . Mutations identi ﬁ ed in all major domains of dystrophin result in disease phenotypes ranging from mild to severe . Beginning with the N - terminus , mutations have been identi ﬁ ed that stem from missense and inframe mutations . In the ABD , a missense mutation resulting in an amino acid change of an arginine residue for leucine 54 results in a DMD phenotype with reduced levels of protein ( Prior et al . , 1995 ) . DMD patients have also been described with inframe deletions of exons 3 – 25 , indirectly resulting in normal levels of truncated protein ( Vainzof et al . , 1993 ) . The rod domain of dystrophin has been found to accommodate large inframe deletions . A case where a patient was found to be missing exons 17 – 48 , corresponding to a 73 % deletion of the rod domain , only exhibited a mild form of BMD ( England et al . , 1990 ) . Large deletions of the rod domain have also been observed in other BMD patients ( Love et al . , 1991 ; Winnard et al . , 1993 ) , the phenotypes of which are usually milder than those of DMD . Few missense mutations have been described in DMD patients , although two informative substitutions have been identi ﬁ ed in the cysteine - rich domain . The cysteine - rich domain contains a number of motifs that are important for regulation and protein - protein interactions . The substitu - tion of a conserved cysteine residue for a tyrosine at position 3340 results in reduced but detectable levels of dystrophin . This mutation alters one of the coordinating residues in the ZZ domain that is thought to interfere with the binding of the dystrophin - associated protein " - dystroglycan ( Lenk et al . , 1996 ) . Another substitution involving an aspartate to a histidine at position 3335 is also thought to affect the " - dystroglycan binding site ( Goldberg et al . , 1998 ) . Removal of a highly conserved 228 BRODERICK AND WINDER glutamic acid ( residue 3367 ) adjacent to the dystrophin ZZ domain results in a phenotype of DMD with substantial retention of a presumably functionally compromised dystrophin protein ( Becker et al . , 2003 ) . Inter - estingly , the cysteine - rich domain is never deleted in BMD patients , sug - gesting that this domain is critical for dystrophin function as the BMD phenotypes are less severe ( Rafael et al . , 1996 ) . A small number of cases have been identi ﬁ ed in which there is a deletion of the carboxy - terminus of dystrophin . In these patients , it is common for the mutant protein to localize to the sarcolemma ( Bies et al . , 1992 ; Helliwell et al . , 1992 ; Hoffman et al . , 1991 ) . These cases are good examples of the importance of the cysteine - rich and C - terminal domains of dystrophin , presumably re ﬂ ecting the importance of interactions with components of the dystrophin - associated glycoprotein complex . Many single point mutations within dystrophin are also known . B . Hereditary Spherocytosis The membrane skeleton acts as an elastic semisolid , allowing brief periods of deformation followed by reestablishment of the original cell shape ( reviewed by Bennett and Gilligan , 1993 ) . Erythrocytes in the human bloodstream have to squeeze repeatedly through narrow capil - laries of diameters smaller than their own dimensions while resisting rupture . A functional erythrocyte membrane is pivotal to maintaining the functional properties of the erythrocyte . This importance is apparent when examination is made of many hemolytic anemias , where mutation of proteins involved in the structure of the submembranous cytoskeleton , and its attachment to the lipid bilayer , result in a malformed or altered cytoskeletal architecture and a disease phenotype . Hereditary spherocytosis ( HS ) comprises a group of inherited hemolytic anemias characterized by chronic hemolysis with a broad spectrum of severity ( Hassoun et al . , 1997 ) . The principal cellular defect is the loss of erythrocyte surface area relative to the intracellular volume , although increased osmotic frailty is also a factor . A distinctive spherical red blood cell ( RBC ) morphology is observed in sufferers of HS and splenic destruc - tion of these abnormal erythrocytes is the primary cause of the hemolysis experienced ( Delaunay , 1995 ; Palek and Jarolim , 1993 ) . The primary biochemical defects of HS are linked to proteins important to the interaction between the membrane skeleton and the lipid bilayer involving ! - and " - spectrin , ankyrin , band 3 , and protein 4 . 2 ( Gallagher and Forget , 1998 ) . Combined spectrin and ankyrin de ﬁ ciency ( Coetzer et al . , 1988 ; Pekrun et al . , 1993 ; Savvides et al . , 1993 ) is most commonly observed , followed by band 3 de ﬁ ciency ( Iolascon et al . , 1992 ; Jarolim et al . , SPECTRIN , ! - ACTININ , AND DYSTROPHIN 229 1990 ; Lux et al . , 1990 ) , isolated spectrin de ﬁ ciency ( Agre et al . , 1986 ; Eber et al . , 1990 ) , and then protein 4 . 2 de ﬁ ciency ( Bouhassira et al . , 1992 ; Ghanem et al . , 1990 ; Rybicki et al . , 1988 ) . Spectrin forms an integral part of the erythrocyte cytoskeletal architec - ture ; any defects that disrupt the association of the spectrin heterotetra - mer or the interaction with any of the other submembranous proteins can result in RBC defects ( reviewed in Hassoun and Palek , 1996 ) . Indeed , abnormalities of the " - spectrin N - terminus and the ! - spectrin C - terminus affect the self - association site and result in hereditary elliptocytosis and hereditary pyropoikilocytosis ( Delaunay , 1995 ; Delaunay and Dhermy , 1993 ; Palek and Jarolim , 1993 ) . Defects outside the self - association site of spectrin are also associated with HS . In many sufferers of HS , both dominant and recessive forms of the disease result in spectrin de ﬁ ciency . Normally ! - spectrin is synthesized in a three - or fourfold excess of " - spectrin ( Hanspal and Palek , 1987 , 1992 ) . Heterozygotes for ! - spectrin should still be able to produce enough normal ! - spectrin to associate with the majority of " - spectrin present in the RBC . The de ﬁ ciency would only become apparent in sufferers who are homozygotes or compound heterozygotes for ! - spectrin gene mutations where there would be insuf ﬁ cient ! - spectrin to associate with " - spectrin . In the case of " - spectrin de ﬁ ciency , mutations of the " - spectrin gene are associated with dominantly inherited HS because " - spectrin is the limiting component in heterotetramer formation ( Gallagher and Forget , 1998 ) . Redundant unassembled ! - spectrin chains are degraded in the lysosomal compartment ( Woods and Lazarides , 1985 ) . As a result of this , the synthe - sis of " - spectrin would seem to be the rate - limiting factor for the assembly of the spectrin ! " heterodimers on the membrane . Therefore , in contrast to ! - spectrin , defects of " - spectrin are more likely to be expressed in the heterozygous state ( Hassoun et al . , 1996 ) . The rate of turnover of the " - spectrin subunit is viewed as critical to the posttranscriptional regulation of the heterodimer assembly on the membrane ( Moon and Lazarides , 1983 ; Woods and Lazarides , 1985 ) . The most common mutations associated with HS are those invol - ving ankyrin . However , many mutations have been identi ﬁ ed that involve spectrin and result in either splicing , missense , deletion , and inser - tion mutations ( see references within Gallagher and Forget , 1998 ) . Of these mutations , two were found in the second CH domain , T182G and I220V , with both residues being important for maintaining the hydropho - bic core of the CH domain ( Becker et al . , 1993 ; Hassoun et al . , 1997 ) . Alteration of Trp 182 to Gly in the short helix B , in particular , would be expected to have a severe effect on the stability of the CH domain with consequent effects on the function of the whole ABD . Another isolated 230 BRODERICK AND WINDER " - spectrin point mutation is also known and results in defective binding to protein 4 . 1 ( Becker et al . , 1993 ; Wolfe et al . , 1982 ) . Further investigation suggested that the mutant spectrin was likely to be unstable and suscepti - ble to proteolytic degradation , leading to an overall spectrin de ﬁ ciency ( Becker et al . , 1993 ) . Mutations within the rod domain of " - spectrin have also been identi - ﬁ ed . A truncated " - spectrin lacking repeat 12 and part of repeat 13 is the product of a large genomic deletion ( Hassoun et al . , 1995 ) . Studies of the mutated spectrin have shown synthesis and stability were unaffected by the deletion , but its incorporation into the membrane skeleton was hampered in erythroblasts . The misincorporation is likely to be a result of defective binding to ankyrin ( Hassoun et al . , 1995 ) as the missing section of the rod domain is in close proximity to the ankyrin - binding domain ( Kennedy et al . , 1991 ) . A second mutation of " - spectrin characterized by truncation and overall de ﬁ ciency was found to involve a point mutation within intron 17 ( Hassoun et al . , 1996 ) . This mutation leads to an unstable transcrip - tional message that lacks exons 16 and 17 . It was proposed that the mutant might be susceptible to proteolytic degradation in the cytoplasm of ery - throblasts , ultimately contributing to a lack of spectrin at the membrane . Several other frameshift , missense , and nonsense mutations of the " - spectrin gene have also been discovered in patients suffering from HS ( Hassoun et al . , 1995 ) . C . Familial Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis In humans , mutations in the ACTN4 gene located on chromosome 19q13 result in ! - actinin - 4 mutations , which are believed to cause a form of familial focal segmental glomerulosclerosis ( FSGS ) ( Kaplan et al . , 2000 ) . FSGS is a common nonspeci ﬁ c renal lesion characterized by regions of sclerosis in some renal glomeruli , often resulting in loss of kidney function and ultimately end - stage renal failure . FSGS is often secondary to other disorders such as HIV infection , obesity , hypertension , and diabetes , but can also appear as an isolated idiopathic condition . When FSGS occurs as a primary process , it is thought to result from a defect in glomerular podocyte function ( Ichikawa and Fogo , 1996 ) . ! - Actinin 4 has been im - plicated in some cases of autosomal dominant FSGS due to the high expression level of this protein in the glomerular podocyte and also its early upregulation during the course of nephritic syndrome in some animal models ( Drenckhahn and Franke , 1988 ; Shirato et al . , 1996 ; Smoyer et al . , 1997 ) . Kaplan and colleagues ( 2000 ) have sequenced the coding region of ACTN4 from a number of families that present one form or another of SPECTRIN , ! - ACTININ , AND DYSTROPHIN 231 FSGS . Three speci ﬁ c residues were characterized — K228E , T232I , and S235P — and can be found on the solvent - accessible surface in helix G of the second CH domain ( Kaplan et al . , 2000 ) . These mutations are not expected to perturb the secondary structure of the actin - binding domain . However , they are all highly conserved among all four human isoforms of ! - actinin , as well as ! - actinins of other species . These mutations are not in a region of CH2 that is thought to directly interact with F - actin . However , their presence has a marked effect on the functionality of the mutant protein when in the cellular environment and when binding to F - actin . Actin - binding experiments using the mutant ! - actinin have revealed that more of the mutant protein associates with F - actin than when the wild type is used . This observation leads to the conclusion that the ACTN4 mutations are able to cause or contribute to the susceptibility to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis ( Kaplan et al . , 2000 ) . The increased af ﬁ nity of ! - actinin - 4 for F - actin was also con ﬁ rmed by Michaud et al . ( 2003 ) . Further investigations performed by Yao and colleagues ( 2004 ) have demonstrated that the mutant ! - actinins exhibit alter structural character - istics , localize abnormally , and are targets for degradation . They suggest that the mutant ! - actinin - 4 is much less dynamic within the cellular environment and , due to its propensity to aggregate , loss of normal function becomes inevitable and contributes to progression of kidney disease . It is possible that the effects of these mutations are more apparent in the kidney due to the high level of expression of ! - actinin 4 in the podocyte ( Drenckhahn et al . , 1990 ; Kurihara et al . , 1995 ) . These dominant mutations may also alter the manner in which ! - actinin interacts with other cytoskeletal components in conjunction with the effects on the normal assembly and disassembly of actin . VII . C onclusion The spectrin superfamily is a group of cytoskeletal proteins that have been found to perform a variety of cellular functions . The role of each protein and their interactions within the cellular environment stem from the speci ﬁ c domains found within each protein and the manner in which they are organized . Each of the family members is formed from discrete modular domains that have the ability to interact or modulate speci ﬁ c interactions or impart physical abilities on the protein relevant to its function . The particular members of this protein family have been shown to be evolutionary related . ! - Actinin is believed to be the ancestor of the whole group and , indeed , sequence and phylogenetic analysis has found this to be the case . It is astounding that from a simple precursor contain - ing few domains such a family of functionally diverse proteins can be 232 BRODERICK AND WINDER generated . It should also be noted that the domains present within the proteins of the spectrin superfamily have been adopted by many other protein groups , further supporting their suitability to perform the interactions that they have evolved . There is still much more to be learned from this group of proteins , including not only their structure - function relationships , but also the manner in which they ﬁ t within the cellular environment as a whole .
