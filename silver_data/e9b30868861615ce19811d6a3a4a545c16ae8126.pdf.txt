The Danish health authorities prioritized persons currently living in long - term care facilities ( LTCF residents ) and frontline healthcare workers ( HCW ) as the first receivers of vaccination . Here we present preliminary population based vaccine effectiveness ( VE ) estimates in these two target groups . Methods The study was designed as a retrospective registry - and population - based observational cohort study including all LTCF residents and all HWC . The outcome was a polymerase chain reaction confirmed SARS - CoV - 2 , and VE was estimated for different periods following first and second dose . We used Poisson and Cox regressions to estimate respectively crude and calendar time - adjusted VE for the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid - 19 Vaccine from Pfizer / BioNTech with 95 % confidence intervals ( CI ) for vaccinated versus unvaccinated . Results A total of 39 , 040 LTCF residents ( median age at first dose ; 84 years , Interquartile range ( IQR ) : 77 - 90 ) and 331 , 039 HCW ( median age at first dose ; 47 years , IQR : 36 - 57 ) were included . Among LTCF residents , 95 . 2 % and 86 . 0 % received first and second dose from 27 December 2020 until 18 February 2021 , for HWC the proportion was 27 . 8 % and 24 . 4 % . During a median follow - up of 53 days , there were 488 and 5 , 663 confirmed SARS - CoV - 2 cases in the unvaccinated groups , whereas there were 57 and 52 in LTCF residents and HCW within the first 7 days after the second dose and 27 and 10 cases beyond seven days of second dose . No protective effect was observed for LTCF residents after first dose . In HCW , VE was 17 % ( 95 % CI ; 4 - 28 ) in the > 14 days after first dose ( before second dose ) . Furthermore , the VE in LTCF residents at day 0 - 7 of second dose was 52 % ( 95 % CI ; 27 - 69 ) and 46 % ( 95 % CI ; 28 - 59 ) in HCW . Beyond seven days of second dose , VE increased to 64 % ( 95 % CI ; 14 - 84 ) and 90 % ( 95 % CI ; 82 - 95 ) in the two groups , respectively . Conclusion The results were promising regarding the VE both within and beyond seven days of second vaccination with the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid - 19 Vaccine currently used in many countries to help mitigate the global SARS - CoV - 2 pandemic . Impact of the research : So far , observational studies of the real - word effectiveness of the mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 has been limited to the period after the administration of the first dose . This is the first report to date to present vaccine effectiveness ( VE ) estimates after the second BNT162b2 mRNA Covid - 19 Vaccine . We estimated a VE of 52 % and 46 % in LTCF residents and HCW within seven days , which increased to 64 % and 90 % in the two groups respectively beyond seven days of immunization . These findings supports maintaining a two - dose schedule of the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid - 19 Vaccine . .

Hence , residents in long - term care facilities ( LTCF ) and front - line healthcare workers ( HCW ) were target groups prioritized for vaccination , when the vaccination program started on 27 December 2020 . On 16 December 2020 ( week 51 ) , a nationwide partial lock down was initiated following widespread community transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 . In week 53 when the immunization program started , there were several reports of Covid - 19 outbreaks in LTCF and the positive percentage for tested LTCF residents was 4 . 21 % ( Figure 1a ) while it was 2 . 21 % for HCW ( Figure 1b ) . The aim was to estimate VE for first and second dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine in two separate cohorts : 1 ) all LTCF residents , and 2 ) all HCW , both with no history of SARS - CoV - 2 , using data from Danish registries . Methods Data All individuals living in Denmark are registered in The Danish Civil Registration System with a unique identifier allowing individual - level linkage between various registers 2 . In this study information on date of birth , immigration and emigration , sex and vital status was collected from The Danish Civil Registration System 3 . Information on laboratory confirmed SARS - CoV - 2 infection was retrieved from the National Danish Microbiology Database ( MiBa ) , where real - time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) test results are registered 4 . Information on all administered BNT162b2 mRNA vaccines was retrieved from the Danish Vaccination Registry 5 . Presence of comorbidity within five years ( data retrieved in October 2019 ) was identified based on ICD - 10 codes registered for all hospital admissions in The National Patient Registry 6 . LTCF residents was identified by linking the Civil Registry System to addresses for LTCF by the Danish Health and Medicines Authority 1 7 . Information on persons working in healthcare was retrieved from The Danish Agency for Labour Market and Recruitment ( described in 8 9 ) . Analyses We used retrospective population - based cohort studies to estimate VE after first and second vaccine dose . The two cohorts included all LTCF residents and all HCW either living in Denmark at start of vaccination ( 27 December 2020 ) or immigrating before the end of study on 18 February 2021 . Persons with PCR confirmed SARS - CoV - 2 before start of the study were excluded . The cohort was followed from the beginning of the immunization program on 27 December 2020 and until date of positive SARS - CoV - 2 test , .

Receiving first and second dose BNT162b2 mRNA was included in the analysis as time - varying exposures . Summary findings for BNT162b2 mRNA presented by the European Medicines Agency was used to identify relevant time periods for analysis 10 11 ; 1 ) 0 - 14 days after first dose ( no protection observed ) 2 ) > 14 days after first dose and until second dose ( partial protection ) 3 ) 0 - 7 days after second dose ( not previously evaluated ) 4 ) > 7 days after second dose ( highest protection ) . The BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine was available from 27 December 2020 , the mRNA - 1273 ( Moderna ) vaccine from 14 January 2021 and ChAdOx1 ( AstraZeneca ) from 9 February 2021 . Only BNT162b2 mRNA was included in this study as the other vaccines had too short follow - up . We used a Poisson regression to estimate crude VE and Cox Proportional Hazards regressions to estimate VE adjusted for either age or calendar time . Data was analyzed using R version 4 . 0 . 3 ( R Foundation for Statistical Computing , https : / / www . R - project . org / ) Results A total of 39 , 040 persons ( median age at time of first dose : 84 years , IQR ( 77 - 90 ) , 63 . 6 % female ) were included in the LTCF residents cohort ( Table 1 ) . From 27 December 2020 through 18 February 2021 , 37 , 172 LTCF residents received the first dose of the vaccine and 33 , 567 received the second dose . The HCW cohort included 331 , 039 persons ( median age at time of first dose : 47 years , IQR ( 36 - 57 ) , 82 . 2 % female ) ( Table 1 ) . During the study period , 91 , 865 HCW received first dose and 80 , 839 received second dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine ( Table 1 ) . Days between first and second dose for LTCF residents and HCW were 24 ( IQR ; 20 - 52 ) and 25 ( IQR 20 - 51 ) , respectively . More than 99 % of the vaccines administered to LTCF residents were BNT162b2 mRNA , which was the case for 89 % in HCW ( on 18 February 2021 ) .

From day 0 - 7 after second dose , the adjusted VE ( VE adj ) was 52 % ( 95 % CI ; 27 - 69 ) in LTCF residents and after 7 days after second dose it increased to 64 % ( 95 % CI ; 14 - 84 ) for this group ( Table 2 ) . A moderate VE adj of 17 % ( 95 % CI ; 4 - 28 ) was observed in HCW from 14 days after first vaccination until second dose ( Table 2 ) .

Adjusting for age , sex and comorbidities did not affect the VE estimates significantly ( data not shown ) . The unadjusted VE was markedly higher than VE adjusted for calendar time , both among LTCF residents and HCW ( Table 2 ) .

When the vaccination program was initiated , the national Covid - 19 incidence was at the highest level since the beginning of the pandemic and the proportion of LTCF residents tested positive for Covid - 19 was increasing ( Figure 1a ) . However , it is worth noting that a partial lockdown had been initiated to reduce circulation of Covid - 19 a few weeks before the immunization program started . These interventions introduced consecutively might explain the higher VE observed in the unadjusted analysis . The calendar time adjusted analysis prevents bias related to the comparison of unvaccinated Covid - 19 cases observed at the start of the vaccination campaign ( characterized by high Covid - 19 ) with Covid - 19 cases observed later on where the Covid - 19 incidence had decreased . When vaccination started , some LTCF residences were dealing with Covid - 19 outbreaks , why vaccination was postponed in these facilities . This selection for vaccination based on Covid - 19 outbreaks may potentially inflate the observed VE . The effects of the national lockdown implemented before Christmas became visual in the beginning of January 2021 , where positive test rates decreased among LTCF residents and HCW ( Figure 1a and 1b ) . Therefore , the rate of infection decreased during the study period . The high vaccination coverage achieved in LTCF may have decreased risk of infection within the facilities , as they are relatively closed settings . The main strengths of this study was that the two population - based cohorts of LTCF residents and HCW were followed using national , high quality information on vaccination status and laboratory SARS - CoV - 2 positive samples . Due to the situation at nursing homes , there was increased focus on testing in LTCF . Furthermore , there was a national testing strategy , where HCW were offered weekly PCR - testing . Therefore , we believe that our study includes close to all cases of SARS - CoV - 2 . Further , our cases included both asymptomatic and symptomatic disease based on all conducted laboratory PCR SARS - CoV - 2 tests , nationally . Test results from rapid antigen tests and PCR tests at private test centers were not available . However , they constitute a small fraction of test conducted in the study cohorts . Antigen tests were only offered in limited extent to some HCWs . The adjusted VE for the HCW cohort presented here , is similar to the vaccine efficacy of 95 % ( 95 % CI ; 90 - 98 ) reported by Polack et al . 10 in a phase III trial including 43 , 448 participants with a median age of 52 at time of vaccination . Another interesting finding that aligned with the phase III trial was the unaffected VE estimates after adjustment for age , sex and comorbid conditions , which may be explained by these populations assumingly being relatively young and healthy at time of vaccination 10 . Expectedly , the estimated VE among LTCF residents was lower ( VE ; 64 % , 95 % CI ; 14 - 84 ) than the VE reported by Polack .

This could be explained by the higher vulnerability and age distribution in our cohort , a median age of 84 years in LTCF residents compared to 52 years among the trial participants . It is also evident from studies of influenza vaccines , that vaccines are less effective in the elderly 12 . We observed a moderate , statistically significant , VE for healthcare workers of 16 % for the period from 14 days after first dose until second dose . A similar , though higher , VE was found in a study from Israel at day 13 - 24 after first dose ( VE ; 51 % , 95 % CI ; 7 . 2 - 78 ) . The results from the two studies suggest a possible moderate effect after first dose . Hunter et al . ( UK ) reanalyzed the data presented by Chodick et al . using a different approach 13 , and they found an increasing VE from day 14 after first dose , peaking at day 21 at 90 % , suggesting a very high level of immunity even after first dose of the vaccine 13 . Recently , another Israeli study have presented VEs for HCW on day 1 - 14 after first dose compared to day 15 - 24 in vaccinated compared to unvaccinated persons . This study observed a VE of 75 % in the latter time period and 35 % in the first period . The authors note that 55 % of the study population had received second dose on day 21 - 22 , but still interpret the findings as related to first dose . We observed no or low VE after just one dose . However , it is important to note that there was a short interval ( median 24 and 25 days ) between first and second dose , and therefore it is unlikely that the full impact of a single dose can be extrapolated from our findings . Our findings compared to findings from studies including only first dose corroborate that a two - dose schedule to obtain maximum benefit of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine is important . Nonetheless , studies with a longer follow - up between first and second dose are warranted in order to explore potential advantages of a strategy with a postponed second dose . The cohorts included in this study are two different segments of the Danish population . The findings on VE in LTCF residents may apply to other vulnerable elderly populations with similar conditions . This is the first study to report VE in LTCF residents , an age group not included in previous studies , where the populations were relatively young . The estimated VEs for HCW might be more generalizable as this population in many ways is comparable with other subpopulations . HCW have special knowledge on importance of protective equipment , why the VE in this group may not extrapolate to all populations in the same age groups . On the other hand , HCW have an increased risk of infection , through patient contacts , that may be higher than in the general population . All in all , the present study confirms , from the field , that two doses of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine offers protection against SARS - CoV - 2 infections in two critical groups , albeit with a better VE among HCW with a median age of 47 years than among a vulnerable population of long - term - care facility residents with a median age of 84 years . .
