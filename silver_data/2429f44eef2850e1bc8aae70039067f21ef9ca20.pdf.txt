An unusually low rate of vesicular transport ( transcytosis ) has been identiﬁed as one of the two unique properties of CNS endothe - lial cells , relative to peripheral endothelial cells , that maintain the restrictive quality of the BBB . However , it is not known how this low rate of transcytosis is achieved . Here we provide a mechanism whereby the regulation of CNS endothelial cell lipid composi - tion speciﬁcally inhibits the caveolae - mediated transcytotic route readily used in the periphery . An unbiased lipidomic analysis reveals signiﬁcant differ - ences in endothelial cell lipid signatures from the CNS and periphery , which underlie a suppression of caveolae vesicle formation and trafﬁcking in brain endothelial cells . Furthermore , lipids transported by Mfsd2a establish a unique lipid environment that in - hibits caveolae vesicle formation in CNS endothelial cells to suppress transcytosis and ensure BBB integrity . INTRODUCTION Vascular beds throughout the body have developed structural and functional heterogeneity to meet the demands of particular organs ( Aird , 2007 ) . The CNS requires a constant homeostatic microenvironment that is free of blood - borne toxins , allowing for proper synaptic transmission and information processing . The endothelial cells that line the walls of CNS blood vessels form a continuous , non - fenestrated vasculature . These cells constitute the blood - brain barrier ( BBB ) , which regulates solute ﬂux between blood circulation and the brain parenchyma ( Andreone et al . , 2015 ; Zhao et al . , 2015 ) . BBB disruption has been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative dis - eases ( Zhao et al . , 2015 ; Zlokovic , 2008 ) . Since BBB functionality is essential for normal brain activity , the impermeable nature of the BBB prevents brain uptake of most neurotherapeutic agents ( Pardridge , 2012 ) . This signiﬁes a major obstacle to drug treat - ment of CNS diseases . Pioneering electron microscopy ( EM ) work by Brightman , Reese , and Karnovsky ( Brightman and Reese , 1969 ; Reese and Karnovsky , 1967 ) identiﬁed two structural features of CNS endothelial cells that underlie the restrictive properties of the BBB . First , specialized tight junctions prevent the paracellular passage of water - soluble molecules from the circulatory system to the brain parenchyma . Second , CNS endothelial cells exhibit unusually low levels of vesicle trafﬁcking , a phenomenon that has generally been assumed to limit transcellular transport ( transcytosis ) . While conventional wisdom has emphasized the importance of tight junctions , recent advances have highlighted the regulation of transcytosis as a crucial factor in limiting BBB permeability under physiological conditions and after patholog - ical assaults ( Armulik et al . , 2010 ; Ben - Zvi et al . , 2014 ; Daneman et al . , 2010b ; Knowland et al . , 2014 ) . However , the mechanism by which the suppression of transcytosis is achieved in CNS endothelial cells is completely unknown . An understanding of how transcytosis is regulated to maintain BBB integrity is not only fundamental to understanding BBB function , but also to developing therapeutic strategies to transiently open the BBB for CNS drug delivery . Transcytotic pathways in epithelial and endothelial cells fall into two categories : clathrin mediated and non - clathrin mediated ( Mayor et al . , 2014 ) . The mechanisms of clathrin - mediated vesicle trafﬁcking are the most studied ; these studies have iden - tiﬁed the transferrin receptor - mediated transcytosis of iron as a key pathway that has been targeted for manipulation at the BBB for drug delivery ( Bien - Ly et al . , 2014 ; Niewoehner et al . , 2014 ) . Non - clathrin - mediated vesicle trafﬁcking pathways utilize a broad range of large - and small - scale membrane invaginations that harness diverse cellular machinery , including dynamin , coat Neuron 94 , 581 – 594 , May 3 , 2017 ª 2017 Elsevier Inc . 581 M f s d2a - G F P G F P GFP fluorescence / DAPI CTB uptake U n t r a n s f ec t e d ce ll G F P 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 N o r m a li z e d C T C F n . s .

Among the many non - clathrin - mediated pathways , cav - eolae - mediated vesicle trafﬁcking predominates as a transcy - totic route used in the endothelial cells of peripheral organs , including heart and lung , to transport solutes from the blood to underlying tissue ( Oh et al . , 2007 , 2014 ; Predescu et al . , 1997 ; Schubert et al . , 2001 ) . Caveolae are 50 – 100 nm invaginations in the plasma membrane ( Bastiani and Parton , 2010 ) . The plasma membrane domains that form caveolae vesicles are highly ordered and enriched in saturated phospholipids , sphin - golipids , ethanolamine plasmalogens ( PE - p ) , and cholesterol ( Parton and del Pozo , 2013 ; Pike et al . , 2002 ) . Additionally , the formation of caveolae vesicles requires the activity of both cav - eolin coat proteins and cytosolic adaptor proteins belonging to the cavin family ( Bastiani and Parton , 2010 ) . Although diverse functions have been identiﬁed for caveolae , their physiological role in different cell types and tissues is not fully understood ( Cheng and Nichols , 2016 ) . Previously , we established that major facilitator superfamily domain containing 2a ( Mfsd2a ) is a key regulator for BBB func - tion ( Ben - Zvi et al . , 2014 ) . Mfsd2a is speciﬁcally expressed in CNS endothelial cells . Genetic ablation of Mfsd2a in mice results in a leaky BBB , as extravasation of several intravenously injected tracers , including 10 and 70 kD dextrans , NHS - biotin , and horse - radish peroxidase ( HRP ) , into the brain parenchyma is observed in Mfsd2a (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice from embryonic stages through adulthood . EM examination of brain endothelial cells from Mfsd2a (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice reveals increased transcytosis , as the intracellular vesicle num - ber signiﬁcantly increases . Additionally , HRP - injected mutants exhibit HRP - ﬁlled vesicles invaginating from the luminal plasma membrane , within the endothelial cell cytoplasm , and exocytos - ing at the abluminal plasma membrane . While these Mfsd2a (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice have transcytotic defects , their tight junctions are normal . These ﬁndings demonstrate that Mfsd2a is speciﬁcally required to regulate transcytosis in CNS endothelial cells of the BBB and that the tracer extravasation observed in Mfsd2a (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice is solely due to increased levels of transcytotic vesicles within these cells . Therefore , Mfsd2a may serve as an ideal molecular handle to understand the mechanism by which transcytosis is regulated at the BBB . There are several potential mechanisms whereby Mfsd2a reg - ulates transcytosis in CNS endothelial cells , such as affecting transcytotic machinery via direct or indirect physical interactions or via controlling plasma membrane tension . Interestingly , in addition to its role in BBB function , Mfsd2a has been identiﬁed as a lipid transporter at the luminal plasma membrane of CNS endothelial cells to deliver the essential omega - 3 fatty acid doco - sahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) into the brain ( Nguyen et al . , 2014 ) . However , how DHA travels from the CNS endothelial cell plasma membrane to neurons is undetermined . DHA is heavily impli - cated in brain development ( Innis , 2007 ) , and , indeed , Mfsd2a (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice have reduced total brain levels of DHA species and exhibit microcephaly ( Nguyen et al . , 2014 ) . Therefore , although there is no existing example of lipids in endothelial cells playing a role in BBB function , examining if Mfsd2a’s lipid transport function is related to BBB integrity will help narrow down the possible mechanisms of Mfsd2a - mediated regulation of transcytosis . In this study , we show how transcytosis is suppressed in CNS endothelial cells to ensure proper BBB function by focusing on Mfsd2a . Using a combination of mouse genetics , lipidomic mass spectrometry , and EM analysis , we elucidate a pathway underlying the cellular mechanism of BBB function : lipids trans - ported by Mfsd2a create a unique lipid composition of CNS endothelial cells that inhibits speciﬁcally caveolae - mediated transcytosis to maintain BBB integrity . Moreover , unbiased lipi - domic analyses reveal that the lipid signatures of endothelial cells from the CNS and the periphery exhibit signiﬁcant differ - ences , which underlie the suppression of caveolae vesicle for - mation and trafﬁcking in brain endothelial cells . Thus , this study establishes that lipid composition of CNS endothelial cells serves as a key new player in the regulation of transcytosis and barrier permeability . RESULTS Mfsd2a Cell - Autonomously Suppresses Vesicular Pit Formation and Cargo Uptake at the Plasma Membrane To understand how transcytosis is regulated at the BBB , we ﬁrst asked whether Mfsd2a is sufﬁcient to suppress endocytic vesicle formation , the ﬁrst step of all transcytotic pathways . Mfsd2a was expressed using lentivirus with high efﬁciency in the immortalized mouse brain endothelial cell line bEnd . 3 , in which endogenous Mfsd2a expression was not detectable ( Fig - ure 1A ) . Exogenous expression of Mfsd2a displayed cell - surface localization in bEnd . 3 cells ( Figure 1B ) , as well as cytoplasmic puncta , as seen in other cell lines ( Nguyen et al . , 2014 ; Reiling et al . , 2011 ) . EM revealed a reduction in the number of apical ( analogous to luminal ) micro - invaginations ( pits ) in cells express - ing Mfsd2a compared to mock - infected control cells ( Figures 1C – 1E ; Table S4A ) . A similar reduction in vesicular pit number was observed in a human pancreatic cancer cell line , PANC - 1 , stably transfected with human MFSD2A - GFP , compared to con - trol cells stably transfected with GFP alone ( Figures 1F – 1H ; Table S4A ) . These ﬁndings suggest that Mfsd2a expression is sufﬁcient to inhibit vesicle formation . To further assess whether Mfsd2a can directly inhibit cargo uptake , we next loaded conﬂuent bEnd . 3 cell cultures with a ﬂuorescent cholera toxin subunit B ( CTB ) tracer ( Figures 1I and 1J ) . Cells that express mouse Mfsd2a - GFP exhibited a 50 % reduction in CTB uptake , as quantiﬁed by ﬂuorescence intensity ( Figure 1L ) , compared to cells that express GFP alone ( Fig - ure 1K ) . Use of the GFP - tagged constructs did not affect Mfsd2a protein localization ( Reiling et al . , 2011 ) ( data not shown ) and allowed for identiﬁcation of positively transfected cells without quenching of the CTB ﬂuorescence due to immunostaining pro - tocol . These gain - of - function results are consistent with previous ( K and L ) CTB uptake quantiﬁed as corrected total cell ﬂuorescence ( CTCF ) per GFP transfected ( K ) or Mfsd2a - GFP transfected ( L ) cell compared to CTCF of at least two untransfected cells per image . n = 4 ; at least 15 transfected cells per experiment . All data are mean ± SEM ; n . s . , not signiﬁcant ; * p < 0 . 05 , * * p < 0 . 01 ( Student’s t test ) . See also Table S4 . Neuron 94 , 581 – 594 , May 3 , 2017 583 in vivo loss - of - function data ( Ben - Zvi et al . , 2014 ) and together demonstrate that Mfsd2a is necessary and sufﬁcient for the sup - pression of vesicle formation and cargo uptake , cellular pro - cesses underlying transcytosis . Furthermore , they suggest that Mfsd2a acts via a direct mechanism to suppress CNS endothe - lial cell transcytosis in a cell - autonomous manner . Mfsd2a Lipid Transport Function Is Required for Suppression of Transcytosis and BBB Integrity ToinvestigatehowMfsd2amayactdirectlyattheCNSendothelial cell plasma membrane to regulate vesicle trafﬁcking , we ﬁrst asked whether the reported lipid transport function of Mfsd2a is required to suppress transcytosis . Although there is no known role of lipids in CNS endothelial cells for BBB function , answering this question will help to narrow down and pinpoint Mfsd2a’s pre - cise mechanism of action . Speciﬁcally to address this question , we generated a transporter - dead Mfsd2a knockin mouse as an in vivo tool . Asp96 is a conserved amino acid required for the cation binding that is crucial for transporter activity in MFS family members ( Ethayathullaetal . , 2014 ) , andtheD96A asparticacidto alaninepointmutationabolishesMfsd2atransportfunctioninvitro ( Nguyen et al . , 2014 ; Reiling et al . , 2011 ) . A mouse line harboring the Mfsd2a D96A mutation in the endogenous Mfsd2a locus was generatedviaCRISPR / Cas9geneediting . Speciﬁcally , oneamino acid change resulting in the D96A missense mutation was intro - duced into exon 3 of Mfsd2a ( Figures 2A , S1B , and S1C ) . Impor - tantly , there was no observable difference in Mfsd2a expression patternin Mfsd2a D96A / D96A ( hereafterdenotedas Mfsd2a D96A ) mu - tants compared to Mfsd2a + / + littermates by immunohistochem - istry of neocortex and cerebellum ( Figures 2B , 2C , S1D , and S1E ) . No difference in Mfsd2a expression was observed by west - ernblotanalysisofbrainlysate ( Figures2Fand2G ) , indicatingthat Mfsd2a D96A mutants express normal levels of Mfsd2a protein . Finally , Mfsd2a expression was restricted to BBB - containing CNS vasculature in Mfsd2a D96A mutants , and was absent in non - BBB - containing vasculature of peripheral organs , including the lung and liver ( Figures 2E and S1G ) , similar to Mfsd2a + / + litter - mates ( Figures 2D and S1F ) ( Ben - Zvi et al . , 2014 ) . To examine the effect of the Mfsd2a D96A mutation on the lipid transport function of Mfsd2a in vivo , we performed lipidomic mass spectrometry on brain lysate at postnatal stages . Lipido - mic analysis of brain lysate revealed an altered lipid proﬁle in Mfsd2a D96A mutants ( Figure S2A ) , with the level of a broad range of phospholipid species changed at postnatal day 4 ( P4 ) , including , but not limited to , DHA - containing species . Impor - tantly , the lipid proﬁle of Mfsd2a D96A mutant brains closely mimicked that of Mfsd2a (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice , as the Mfsd2a (cid:1) / (cid:1) / Mfsd2a + / + log ratio was very similar to the Mfsd2a D96A / Mfsd2a + / + log ratio of phospholipid levels measured by mass spectrometry ( Figures 2H , S2A , and S2B ; Tables S1 and S2 ) . Together , these data demonstrate that the Mfsd2a D96A mutation abolishes the lipid transport function of Mfsd2a in vivo without affecting protein expression , resulting in a lipid proﬁle similar to that observed through global loss of Mfsd2a . Finally , Mfsd2a D96A mutants ex - hibited microcephaly at P4 ( Figure 2I ) , recapitulating the pheno - type observed in Mfsd2a (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice ( Nguyen et al . , 2014 ) and conﬁrming that Mfsd2a lipid transport function is required for brain development . With this new genetic tool , we next asked if Mfsd2a lipid trans - port function is necessary for suppression of transcytosis and control of BBB permeability . Previously , it was shown that Mfsd2a (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice exhibit BBB leakage that is due to increased levels of transcytosis in CNS endothelial cells ( Ben - Zvi et al . , 2014 ) . Because an increased vesicle number in CNS endothelial cells is the hallmark of the increased transcytosis phenotype observed in Mfsd2a (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice , we examined vesicle number in Mfsd2a D96A mutants at P4 using EM ( Figures 3A – 3D ) . Mfsd2a D96A mutants exhibited a signiﬁcant increase in density of both luminal and abluminal membrane - connected vesicles ( Figures 3E and 3F ; Table S4B ) , similar to the phenotype observed in Mfsd2a (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice , indicating an upregulation of trans - cytosis . We next injected HRP into adult Mfsd2a D96A mutants and Mfsd2a + / + littermates and examined sub - cellular tracer localization . While HRP tracer was conﬁned to the vessel lumen in Mfsd2a + / + mice ( Figures 3G and 3H ) , tracer in Mfsd2a D96A mu - tants was observed being taken up into intracellular vesicles at the luminal plasma membrane , within the cytoplasm , and at the abluminal plasma membrane ( Figures 3I and 3J ) , indicating that the upregulated vesicles in Mfsd2a D96A mutants act as transcytotic carriers . In both Mfsd2a + / + wild - type littermates and Mfsd2a D96A mice , HRP tracer entered the space between CNS endothelial cells but was sharply halted at tight junction ‘‘kissing points’’ ( Figures 3K and 3L ) , indicating that tight junc - tions are functional . Together , these data demonstrate that loss of Msfd2a transport function results in increased CNS endo - thelial cell transcytosis , without impacting tight junction integrity . To determine whether the observed increased transcytosis re - sults in BBB leakage in Mfsd2a D96A mutants , we performed intra - venous injection of ﬂuorescent tracer at P4 and examined tracer localization as a metric of BBB integrity . We chose 10 kD dextran tracer for analysis , as robust extravasation of this tracer was previously observed in Mfsd2a (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice ( Ben - Zvi et al . , 2014 ) . While tracer was completely conﬁned within the vasculature of Mfsd2a + / + littermate control animals ( Figure 3M ) , tracer extrava - sation was observed throughout the brain of Mfsd2a D96A mu - tants ( Figure 3N ) , with tracer diffused into the brain parenchyma and taken up by non - vascular cells . Permeability index quantiﬁ - cation ( deﬁned as area of tracer / area of vessels ) revealed a sta - tistically signiﬁcant increase of BBB leakage in Mfsd2a D96A mutants compared to Mfsd2a + / + controls ( Figure 3O ) . BBB leakage in Mfsd2a D96A mutants persisted into adulthood , as HRP tracer extravasation into the forebrain parenchyma was observed at P90 ( Figures S3A and S3B ) . Taken together , these data demonstrate that BBB leakage occurs in Mfsd2a D96A mice via increased transcytosis , similar to Mfsd2a (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice . Furthermore , they strongly implicate the lipid transport function of Mfsd2a in the suppression of vesicle trafﬁcking . Brain Capillaries Possess a Lipid Signature Underlying Suppression of Caveolae Our results demonstrate that Mfsd2a cell - autonomously sup - presses vesicle trafﬁcking via a lipid transport - dependent mech - anism . This raises the possibility that lipid transport directly affects the membrane lipid composition of CNS endothelial cells , which in turn may result in the suppression of transcytosis at the BBB . To further understand the link between lipids and vesicle 584 Neuron 94 , 581 – 594 , May 3 , 2017 trafﬁcking , we next asked whether the lipid composition of CNS endothelial cells , a previously unexplored facet of BBB function , shows any differences compared to peripheral endothelial cells . To investigate this possibility , we performed lipidomic mass spectrometry analysis on acutely isolated capillaries from brain and lung of wild - type mice at P4 . Lung vasculature does not possess the restrictive barrier properties of CNS vasculature , and lung endothelial cells are enriched in transcytotic vesicles , which have been shown to transport cargo from the circulation to the lung parenchyma ( Ghitescu et al . , 1986 ; Oh et al . , 2007 ; Schubert et al . , 2001 ) . Western blot analysis showed that this capillary preparation is highly enriched in endothelial cells in both brain and lung , indicated by an abundance of VE - cadherin protein compared to total tissue lysate ( Figure S4B ) . Residual pericytes were present in both brain and lung capillary prepara - tions , and , importantly , the brain capillary preparation was free of both neurons ( NeuN ) and astrocyte endfeet ( Aquaporin - 4 ) ( Fig - ures S4A and S4B ) . Lipidomic analysis revealed that although most lipid species were found at similar levels in isolated brain and lung capillaries , signiﬁcant differences in several lipid species were observed ( Figures 4A and S4C ; Table S3 ) .

Although both the acutely isolated brain and lung capillary preparations retained residual pericytes , it unlikely that these cells contribute to the observed differences in lipid signature , for pericytes do not express Mfsd2a ( Ben - Zvi et al . , 2014 ) , the only known DHA transporter in the brain ; there is no evidence that pericytes are able to synthesize DHA de novo ; and both brain and lung capillary preparations were highly en - riched in endothelial cells . Notably , lung endothelial cells have abundant caveolae vesi - cles that can act as transcytotic carriers ( Ghitescu et al . , 1986 ; Oh et al . , 2007 ; Schubert et al . , 2001 ) . The formation and func - tionality of caveolae membrane domains can be affected by plasma membrane lipid composition ( Lingwood and Simons , 2010 ; Parton and del Pozo , 2013 ) . In particular , DHA is a highly unsaturated fatty acid that disrupts liquid - ordered caveolae domains , normally enriched in saturated phospholipids , sphin - golipids , PE - p species , and cholesterol . DHA displaces Caveolin - 1 ( Cav - 1 ) , a coat protein of the caveolin family that is obligatory for caveolae vesicle formation , from the plasma mem - brane . Thus , enrichment of DHA in the plasma membrane ren - ders caveolae membrane domains less capable of forming caveolae vesicles ( Chen et al . , 2007 ; Li et al . , 2007 ; Ma et al . , 2004 ) . Therefore , the lipid composition of brain capillaries en - riched in DHA species and low in PE - p species may reﬂect a plasma membrane microenvironment in CNS endothelial cells that is unfavorable for the assembly of functional caveolae do - mains and subsequent vesicle formation . Together , these ana - lyses reveal signiﬁcant differences in the lipid signature of BBB - containing brain capillaries versus non - BBB - containing lung capillaries , some of which may contribute to the suppres - sion of transcytosis at the BBB by inhibiting caveolae vesicle for - mation and trafﬁcking in CNS endothelial cells . Signiﬁcantly reduced levels of several triglycerides ( TAGs ) and cholesteryl ester ( CE ) species were observed in brain capillaries versus lung capillaries ( Figures S5B and S5C ) . TAGs and CEs are stored in intracellular lipid droplets ( Guo et al . , 2009 ) , and both in vitro and in vivo evidence suggests that the storage of these lipids depends on caveolae vesicle trafﬁcking ( Cohen et al . , 2004 ; Martin and Parton , 2005 ; Pol et al . , 2004 ) . Therefore , low levels of TAGs and CEs in brain capillaries may reﬂect a low level of caveolae trafﬁcking . Together these observations raise the possibility that caveolae vesicles may be the subtype increased in CNS endothelial cells that accounts for the leaky BBB in Mfsd2a (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice . Caveolae Vesicle Trafﬁcking Is Upregulated in Mfsd2a – / – Mice To test this hypothesis , we performed Cav - 1 immuno - EM label - ing in brains of Mfsd2a (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice and control littermates ( Figures 5A – 5H ) . Cav - 1 immunoreactivity ( gold particles ) was seen along the luminal plasma membrane in CNS endothelial cells of Mfsd2a + / + control mice , whereas immunoreactivity in Mfsd2a (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice was observed along the luminal and abluminal plasma membranes ( Figure 5G ) , and surrounding vesicle structures in the cytoplasm ( Figure 5H ) . Additionally , there was a signif - icant increase in the number of Cav - 1 - positive vesicles in CNS endothelial cells of Mfsd2a (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice compared to controls A Brain Lung C38 : 6 PC C40 : 9 PC C40 : 6 PC 0 2 10 8 4 10 8 6 10 8 8 10 8 0 1000000 2000000 3000000 I n t e g r a t e d p eak a r ea C22 : 6 LPE C38 : 6 PE C40 : 6 PE 0 5 . 0 10 7 1 . 0 10 8 1 . 5 10 8 2 . 0 10 8 2 . 5 10 8 0 2 10 7 4 10 7 6 10 7 C38 : 6 PS C40 : 6 PS * * * * * * * * 0 1 10 8 2 10 8 3 10 8 1 10 9 2 10 9 3 10 9 0 1 10 8 2 10 8 3 10 8 1 10 9 2 10 9 3 10 9 Brain capillary lipid level ( integrated peak area ) Lu ng ca p ill a r y li p i d l eve l ( i n t e g r a t e d p eak a r ea ) B I n t e g r a t e d p eak a r ea I n t e g r a t e d p eak a r ea I n t e g r a t e d p eak a r ea : DHA - containing phospholipid ( C34 : 0 PC ) ( C38 : 4 PE ) Figure 4 .

These data suggest that caveolae vesicle trafﬁcking is upregulated in mice lacking Mfsd2 a , and that Mfsd2a may normally act to suppress caveolae - mediated trans - cytosis in CNS endothelial cells . Caveolae - Mediated Transcytosis Is Speciﬁcally Suppressed Downstream of Mfsd2a Function at the BBB In Vivo To directly test the idea that the caveolae - mediated transcytosis pathway is suppressed downstream of Mfsd2a function at the BBB , we performed a genetic rescue experiment by crossing Mfsd2a (cid:1) / (cid:1) with Cav - 1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice , as Cav - 1 is obligatory for caveo - lae formation . While Cav - 1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice are viable , they are unable to form caveolae vesicle structures and display defects in cargo uptake in vivo ( Razani et al . , 2001 ; Schubert et al . , 2001 ) . If the caveolae pathway is downstream of Mfsd2a in vivo , then crossing Cav - 1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice with Mfsd2a (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice should reverse the upregulated transcytosis seen in Mfsd2a (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice , as CNS endothelial cells of Mfsd2a (cid:1) / (cid:1) ; Cav - 1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) double knockouts will no longer be able to form caveolae vesicles to act as transcytotic carriers .

See also Table S4 . pathways , increased transcytosis will still be observed in Mfsd2a (cid:1) / (cid:1) ; Cav - 1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) dou - ble knockouts . Similar to previous results ( Ben - Zvi et al . , 2014 ) , EM analysis revealed occa - sional vesicles in Mfsd2a + / + ; Cav - 1 + / + wild - type CNS endothelial cells at P5 ( Fig - ures 6A and 6B ) , with an over 2 . 5 - fold in - crease in total luminal and abluminal membrane - connected vesicle density in Mfsd2a (cid:1) / (cid:1) ; Cav - 1 + / + single knockouts ( Figures 6C , 6D , 6I , and 6J ) . Consistent with the ﬁnding that Cav - 1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice are unable to form caveolae vesicles , we observed a nearly 2 - fold decrease in vesicle density in Mfsd2a + / + ; Cav - 1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) single knockouts compared to wild - type levels ( Figures 6E , 6F , 6I , and 6J ) . However , in Mfsd2a (cid:1) / (cid:1) ; Cav - 1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) double knockouts , a complete reversal of the Mfsd2a (cid:1) / (cid:1) single mutant phenotype was evident , with vesicle density mimicking that of Cav - 1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) single mutants ( Figures 6G – 6J ; Table S4D ) . Therefore , the caveolae - mediated transcy - tosis pathway is the one that is normally suppressed by Mfsd2a . In contrast , no signiﬁcant difference in the density of clathrin - coated pits , identiﬁed under EM by the presence of an electron - dense clathrin coat ( Figure S6A ) , was observed in Mfsd2a (cid:1) / (cid:1) , Cav - 1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) , Mfsd2a (cid:1) / (cid:1) ; Cav - 1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) , or Mfsd2a D96A mu - tants compared to their littermate controls ( Figures S6B – S6E ; Tables S4E and S4F ) . Together , these data demonstrate that Mfsd2a acts upstream of Cav - 1 speciﬁcally to suppress the cav - eolae vesicle trafﬁcking pathway at the BBB . Finally , we asked if caveolae - mediated transcytosis is required for regulating BBB permeability by examining whether genetic loss of Cav - 1 is able to rescue the BBB leakage observed in the brains of Mfsd2a (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice . To evaluate BBB permeability , we again examined 10 kD dextran tracer localization in the brain after intravenous injection at P5 .

Tracer extravasation was observed in Mfsd2a (cid:1) / (cid:1) ; Cav - 1 + / + single knockouts , as tracer diffused into the brain and was taken up by non - vascular paren - chymal cells ( Figure 6L ) . A signiﬁcant increase in the permeability index quantiﬁcation of Mfsd2a (cid:1) / (cid:1) ; Cav - 1 + / + single knockouts was observed , compared to both Mfsd2a + / + ; Cav - 1 + / + wild - type and Mfsd2a + / + ; Cav - 1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) single knockouts ( Figure 6O ) . However , no leakage was observed in Mfsd2a (cid:1) / (cid:1) ; Cav - 1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) dou - ble knockouts , as tracer was conﬁned within the brain vascula - ture and the permeability index quantiﬁcation revealed no signif - icant difference to that of both Mfsd2a + / + ; Cav - 1 + / + wild - type and Mfsd2a + / + ; Cav - 1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) single knockouts ( Figures 6N and 6O ) . This observed rescue of BBB leakage was also evidenced at adult stages , as extravasation of HRP tracer into the forebrain paren - chyma was observed in Mfsd2a (cid:1) / (cid:1) ; Cav - 1 + / + single knockouts ( Figure S3D ) , but not wild - type , Cav - 1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) single knockout , or Mfsd2a (cid:1) / (cid:1) ; Cav - 1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) double knockout mice at P90 ( Figures S3C , S3E , and S3F ) . Consistent with previous ﬁndings ( Know - land et al . , 2014 ) , we found that tight junctions were functional in Cav - 1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice , as HRP tracer was halted at tight junction ‘‘kissing points’’ in both Cav - 1 mutants ( Figures S7C and S7D ) and wild - type littermates ( Figures S7A and S7B ) under EM . Together with our vesicle density analysis , these data indicate that increased caveolae vesicle trafﬁcking results in the BBB leakage observed in Mfsd2a (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice , as genetic loss of Cav - 1 was able to rescue tracer extravasation . Furthermore , of the numerous vesicular trafﬁcking pathways currently known , these data demonstrate that Mfsd2a maintains BBB integrity by speciﬁcally suppressing the caveolae - mediated transcytotic pathway . Caveolae - Mediated Transcytosis Is Not Required for Delivery of DHA into the Brain Parenchyma for Brain Development Interestingly , although Mfsd2a (cid:1) / (cid:1) ; Cav - 1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) double knockouts were able to rescue the BBB defects seen in Mfsd2a (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice , they were unable to rescue the microcephaly phenotype ( Fig - ure 7 ) . Thus , the caveolae pathway downstream of Mfsd2a in CNS endothelial cells speciﬁcally controls transcytosis and BBB function , but is not required for Mfsd2a - mediated delivery of DHA into the brain parenchyma for proper brain development . Our analysis of the Mfsd2a D96A mouse , together with the comparative brain and lung capillary lipidomic proﬁling , indi - cates that the suppression of the caveolae pathway requires the transport of lipids , notably DHA - containing phospholipids , by Mfsd2a to regulate CNS endothelial cell plasma membrane composition and inhibit caveolae vesicle formation . DISCUSSION While it was observed nearly 50 years ago that CNS endothelial cells exhibit unusually low levels of transcytotic vesicles ( Bright - man and Reese , 1969 ; Reese and Karnovsky , 1967 ) , it has re - mained poorly understood whether this low rate of transcytosis is important for BBB function , what type of vesicles are involved , and how vesicle formation and transcytosis are maintained at low levels in brain endothelial cells . In this study , we reveal that the unique membrane lipid composition of CNS endothelial cells regulates BBB permeability by suppressing caveolae - mediated transcytosis . Our ﬁndings support a model in which Mfsd2a - mediated transport of DHA controls the luminal plasma mem - brane DHA lipid composition of CNS endothelial cells such that it actively prevents the formation of functional caveolae mem - brane domains ( Figures 8A and 8B ) . Thus , unlike lung endothelial cells , which have low levels of DHA and display high levels of transcytotic caveolae vesicles , Mfsd2a - mediated lipid transport into CNS endothelial cells renders them less capable of forming caveolae vesicles to act as transcytotic carriers . As a result , the BBB is functional . Together , these ﬁndings uncover a mecha - nism for the suppression of transcytosis in CNS endothelial cells to maintain BBB integrity , and reveal an essential role for the pre - cise control of membrane lipid composition in the regulation of BBB permeability .

Our demon - stration of the in vivo requirement of the lipid transport func - tion of Mfsd2a for the suppression of transcytosis and BBB permeability , coupled with our result of lipidomic proﬁling of capillaries from brain versus lung , reveals lipid composition of CNS endothelial cells as a key regulator for BBB function . Previous work on Mfsd2a has focused on the deleterious con - sequences of decreased DHA levels in brain parenchymal cells , such as behavioral abnormalities and microcephaly ( Alakbarzade et al . , 2015 ; Guemez - Gamboa et al . , 2015 ; Nguyen et al . , 2014 ) . Our results demonstrate an additional direct functional role of DHA transport at the CNS endothelial cell luminal plasma membrane , the site of Mfsd2a expression in the brain , for suppression of caveolae transcytosis and maintenance of BBB integrity . Besides DHA species , C34 : 0 PC and C38 : 4 PE are also signiﬁcantly enriched in brain cap - illaries relative to lung capillaries , and their function at the BBB remains to be determined . Together , our Mfsd2a D96A mouse model and brain versus lung lipidomic proﬁling illuminate a previously unknown role of CNS endothelial cell lipid compo - sition in BBB integrity . These ﬁndings may usher in new lines of research into how the metabolomic , in addition to the pro - teomic , signature of CNS endothelial cells regulates BBB function . Suppression of Caveolae - Mediated Transcytosis Is Essential for BBB Function Compared to the relatively well - studied mechanisms of clathrin - mediated vesicle trafﬁcking , the physiology of caveolae is less understood . Caveolae have multiple putative functions at the plasma membrane , including cell signal transduction , mechano - sensation , lipid metabolism , and plasma membrane organiza - tion , and their physiological role in different cell types and tissues is not fully clear ( Cheng and Nichols , 2016 ; Parton and del Pozo , 2013 ) . While endothelial cells in peripheral organs , such as the lung and heart , are enriched in caveolae , and previous studies have demonstrated that caveolae vesicles act as transcytotic carriers in these peripheral organ endothelial cells ( Ghitescu et al . , 1986 ; Oh et al . , 2007 , 2014 ; Schubert et al . , 2001 ) , there remains a long - standing debate as to what role , if any , caveolae play in transcytosis . In particular , recent in vitro studies have challenged the notion that caveolae signiﬁcantly contribute to endocytic or transcytotic ﬂux ( Bitsikas et al . , 2014 ; Shvets et al . , 2015 ) . Our genetic rescue experiments demonstrate that the presence of transcytotic caveolae vesicles accounts for BBB leakage in the absence of Mfsd2a , and thus assign a phys - iological role to caveolae - mediated transcytosis in CNS endo - thelial cells to regulate BBB permeability . Regulated Lipid Composition Suppresses Caveolae - Mediated Transcytosis for BBB Function The mutation of a single amino acid caused Mfsd2a D96A trans - porter - dead mice to phenocopy the increased transcytosis and BBB leakage defects observed in Mfsd2a (cid:1) / (cid:1) global knockout mice . Our unbiased lipidomic analysis showing DHA species as one of the most signiﬁcantly enriched lipid populations in brain Lung ( non - BBB - containing ) endothelial cell A Cav - 1 Brain ( BBB - containing ) endothelial cell B DHA DHA DHADHADHA Mfsd2a outer leaflet inner leaflet Cav - 1 Figure 8 . Model for the Suppression of Caveolae - Mediated Transcytosis via Regulated Membrane Lipid Composition at the BBB ( A ) Non - BBB - containing lung endothelial cells do not express Mfsd2a , display low levels of DHA , and display high levels of transcytotic caveolae vesicles , characterized by the presence of Cav - 1 coat protein ( purple ) . ( B ) BBB - containingbrainendothelialcellsexpressMfsd2a ( green ) . Mfsd2aactsasalipidﬂippase , transportingphospholipids , includingDHA - containingspecies ( orange ) , from the outer to inner plasma membrane leaﬂet . The increased levels of DHA , and presumably other lipid changes , alter the plasma membrane composition such that caveolae vesicles are unable to form and act as transcytotic carriers . Thus , brain endothelial cells display low levels of caveolae vesicles . This suppression of caveolae formation and trafﬁcking subsequently ensures BBB integrity under normal conditions . Neuron 94 , 581 – 594 , May 3 , 2017 591 capillaries compared to lung capillaries further points to a direct role of DHA in the suppression of caveolae vesicles . How does DHA inhibit caveolae vesicles ? Caveolae formation depends on both Cav - 1 and cholesterol ( Lingwood and Simons , 2010 ; Parton and del Pozo , 2013 ) . Our ﬁndings support previous studies that have shown that DHA treatment of human retinal endothelial cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells re - sulted in a signiﬁcant depletion of cholesterol in the membrane as well as the displacement of Cav - 1 and several signaling pro - teins resident in caveolae ( Chen et al . , 2007 ; Li et al . , 2007 ) . Moreover , in vivo studies show that feeding mice with omega - 3 fatty acid - enriched diet resulted in a concomitant reduction of cholesterol and Cav - 1 in mouse colon epithelium ( Ma et al . , 2004 ) . Therefore , it is likely that in CNS endothelial cells , Mfsd2a acts as a lipid ﬂippase ( Quek et al . , 2016 ) , transporting phospho - lipids , including DHA - containing species , from the outer to the inner plasma membrane leaﬂet . The increased levels of DHA in the inner plasma membrane leaﬂet subsequently cause the displacement of cholesterol and Cav - 1 , thereby inhibiting cave - olae formation . It is plausible that DHA enrichment in the plasma membranes results in higher membrane ﬂuidity and low mem - brane curvature that is not favorable for caveolae formation . In light of the emerging evidence in both the normal and diseased brain that transcytosis represents a major mechanism for BBB function ( Armulik et al . , 2010 ; Ben - Zvi et al . , 2014 ; Chow and Gu , 2017 ; Daneman et al . , 2010b ; Haley and Lawrence , 2017 ; Knowland et al . , 2014 ) , our work provides a mechanistic understanding of how transcytotic pathways are suppressed in the CNS to ensure this function . Future studies , including exam - ining the effect of acute removal of Mfsd2a function in adult mice and the effect of dietary manipulation of lipids on transcytosis and BBB permeability , will shed new light on the development of new therapeutic strategies . It has been postulated that Mfsd2a may serve to modulate transcytotic mechanisms in CNS endothelial cells for therapeutic purposes ( Betsholtz , 2014 ; Zhao and Zlokovic , 2014 ) . By pinpointing the speciﬁc transcytotic route that Mfsd2a suppresses , and by illuminating a novel role of membrane lipid metabolism in BBB function , this work may prompt the development of new strategies to deliver drugs to the diseased CNS , potentially via the use of lipid - based biologics to ‘‘de - repress’’ the caveolae pathway .

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS Animal Models All mice were group housed in standard vivarium conditions , with ad libitum access to diet and water . Mfsd2a null mice ( MMRRC strain 032467 - UCD ; RRID : MGI : 5755244 ) were maintained on a mixed B6 / 129 background and were used to test the involvement of Mfsd2a in transcytosis and BBB permeability . Cav - 1 null mice ( JAX : 004585 ; RRID : IMSR _ JAX : 004585 , mixed B6 / 129 back - ground ) were used to test the involvement of caveolae - mediated transcytosis in BBB permeability . Mfsd2a D96A mice were generated at HHMI Janelia Farm . The D96A mutation was generated using the following : gRNA sequence 5 0 - GCCTTCACTGACCCTCTGGTGGG - 3 0 , donor oligonucleotide sequence 5 0 - TGCTTCTTCCCCATGGCAGGTGGAAC CACTTCCTGCTTCCATTATCCTTTTTGTGGGCCGAGCCTGGGATGCCTTCACTGCCCCACTAGTGGGCTTCTGCATTAGCAAGTCC TCCTGGACCCGCCTGGGCCGCCTCATGCCCTGGTAAGTAGAGACGCTCCTTCGAAG - 3 0 , and cas9 protein ( Thermo Fisher Scien - tiﬁc , Cat # NC0789474 ) , with an injection concentration : Cas9 / gRNA / donor oligonucleotide = 100ng / 100ng / 20ng / m l . The mouse strain B6SJF1 / J ( JAX : 100012 ) was used for injection , with an injection efﬁciency of 62 . 5 % ( 20 / 32 ) . Founder Mfsd2a D96A mice were backcrossed to C57BL / 6 mice ( Charles River ) for three generations prior to analysis . The open - access online tool , CCTop ( Stemmer et al . , 2015 ) was used to analyze the possibility of off - target DSBs in Mfsd2a D96A mice . The possibility of off - target muta - tions was experimentally assessed by Sanger sequencing of genomic DNA ﬂanking top potential off - target sequences , with no mu - tations found in Mfsd2a D96A genomic DNA . A 250 bp PCR product containing Mfsd2a exon 3 was ampliﬁed using the following primers : 5 0 - TTGGTGGTTCAGCTGTGCCA - 3 0 and 5 0 - GACACCAGAAGCCTGCCTTT - 3 0 , and Sanger sequenced with 5 0 - ATGCT CCGCTAAGGCAATGA - 3 0 to conﬁrm generation of the D96A point mutation and SpeI restriction site . For genotyping , PCR products were digested with SpeI and run on agarose gels to test for the presence of the Mfsd2a D96A allele . No animal randomization was performed and both male and female mice were used for experiments and no sex - based differences in phenotype were observed . Animals were genotyped via allele - speciﬁc PCR reactions and experiments were performed with observer not blinded to genotype . Information regarding the age of mice used for each speciﬁc experiment can be found in the Results and Figure Legends .

METHOD DETAILS Lipid proﬁling Lipids from whole brain , and brain and lung isolated capillary lysates were proﬁled using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry ( LC - MS ) method operated on a Nexera X2 U - HPLC ( Shimadzu Scientiﬁc Instruments ) coupled to an Exactive Plus orbitrap MS ( Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc ) . Brieﬂy , tissue samples were homogenized in a weight proportional volume of water ( 4 m l / mg of tissue ) using a TissueLyser II ( QIAGEN ) . Equal starting amounts of tissue homogenate were used as starting material for all mass spectrometry . Lipids were extracted from homogenates ( 10 m l ) using 190 m l of isopropanol containing 1 , 2 - didodeca - noyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine as an internal standard ( Avanti Polar Lipids ) . After centrifugation ( 10 min , 10 , 000 x g , ambient temperature ) , supernatants ( 2 m l ) were injected directly onto a 100 3 2 . 1 mm ACQUITY BEH C8 column ( 1 . 7 m m ; Waters ) . The column was eluted at a ﬂow rate of 450 m L / min isocratically for 1 min at 80 % mobile phase A ( 95 : 5 : 0 . 1 vol / vol / vol 10 mM ammonium acetate / methanol / formic acid ) , followed by a linear gradient to 80 % mobile - phase B ( 99 . 9 : 0 . 1 vol / vol methanol / formic acid ) over 2 min , a linear gradient to 100 % mobile phase B over 7 min , and then 3 min at 100 % mobile - phase B . MS analyses were carried out using electrospray ionization in the positive ion mode using full scan analysis over m / z 200 - 1100 at 70 , 000 resolution and 3 Hz data acquisition rate .

The same forebrain regions were imaged among littermate pairs . The same background subtraction and auto threshold parameters were applied to max z - projections of both Isolectin / Claudin - 5 ( endothelium vessel markers ) , and dextran ( tracer ) channels . Masks of both channels were generated and the permeability index of leakage was deﬁned as the area of tracer mask divided by area of vessels mask . A leakage value of 1 signiﬁes no tracer extravasation , while signiﬁcantly higher values signify tracer extravasation . TEM Quantiﬁcation For all TEM quantiﬁcations , mean vesicular pit / vesicular density values were calculated from the number of vesicles per m m of mem - brane for each image collected . All images were collected at 12000x magniﬁcation . Density values for each cell source / genotype reﬂect the average of mean density values obtained from each individual experiment / animal and are expressed as mean ± s . e . m . Statistical Analysis All statistical analyses were performed using Prism 7 ( GraphPad Software ) . Two group comparisons were analyzed using an unpaired two - tailed Student’s t test . Multiple group comparisons were analyzed using a one - way ANOVA , followed by a post hoc Tukey’s test . Sample size for all experiments was determined empirically using standards generally employed by the ﬁeld , and no data was excluded when performing statistical analysis . Standard error of the mean was calculated for all experiments and displayed as errors bars in graphs . Statistical details for speciﬁc experiments , including exact n values and what n represents , precision measures , statistical tests used , and deﬁnitions of signiﬁcance can be found in the Figure Legends .
