However , the exact level of overdispersion , demographics , and other factors associated with secondary transmission remain elusive . In this study , we aimed to elucidate the frequency and patterns of secondary transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 in Japan . Methods We analyzed 16 , 471 cases between January and August 2020 . We generated the number of secondary cases distribution and estimated the dispersion parameter ( k ) by fitting the negative binomial distribution in each phase . The frequencies of the secondary transmission were compared by demographic and clinical characteristics , calculating the odds ratio by logistic regression models . Results We observed that 76 . 7 % of the primary cases did not generate secondary cases with an estimated dispersion parameter k of 0 . 23 . The demographic patterns of primary - secondary cases differed between phases , with 20 – 69 years being the predominant age group . There were higher proportions of secondary cases among elderly , symptomatic cases , and those with two days or more between onset and confirmation . Conclusions The study demonstrated the estimation of the frequency of secondary transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 and the characteristics of people who generated the secondary transmission . 6 Key words COVID - 19 , secondary transmission , super spreading events , overdispersion , dispersion parameter Introduction Epidemiological findings on coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) have accumulated at an unprecedented rate . A key finding is the heterogeneity in the number of secondary transmissions , which is often characterized as overdispersion . Super - spreading events are essential factors contributing to the sustained transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 ( Endo et al . , 2020 ; Xu et al . , 2020 ) similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) ( Leo et al . , 2003 ) and other infectious diseases ( Kucharski and Althaus , 2015 ; Lau et al . , 2017 ; Wong et al . , 2015 ) . A study in Hong Kong revealed that only 19 % of infected persons with COVID - 19 generated 80 % of all transmissions . Contrastingly , 69 % of cases did not lead to secondary transmissions , indicating substantial transmission heterogeneity ( Adam et al . , 2020 ) . In addition , a study in Korea reported temporal changes in the level of transmission overdispersion during different epidemic periods ( Lim et al . , 2021 ) . A study conducted in Japan at the beginning of the COVID - 19 outbreak examining 110 cases , including 11 clusters , identified that the majority of infected individuals did not generate any secondary transmission ( Nishiura et al . , 2020b ) . The characteristics of clusters at the early stage of the outbreak were also analysed in Japan ( Furuse et al . , 2020b ) . Based on these findings , Japan developed a cluster - based approach to COVID - 19 management that focuses on identifying and preventing clusters ( super - spreading events ) to suppress transmission ( Oshitani , 2020 ) . 7 COVID - 19 vaccinations are rapidly progressing in many countries , and real - world data indicate that the impact of COVID - 19 could be significantly reduced by vaccination ( Haas et al . , 2021 ) . However , reduced vaccine efficacy against the delta variant ( Lopez Bernal et al . , 2021 ) and waning of vaccine immunity resulting in breakthrough infections have recently been reported ( Rosenberg et al . , 2021 ) . Furthermore , vaccine coverage remains low in many countries , especially low - and middle - income countries ( Ritchie et al . , 2020 ) . Therefore , developing more effective public health measures to suppress transmission is critical . To achieve this , the exact level of overdispersion and the demographic characteristics that are likely to generate secondary cases need to be defined . It is also necessary to identify whether the level of overdispersion changes during the different phases of COVID - 19 transmission . This study aimed to analyze the frequency and demographic patterns of secondary transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 during the first two waves in Japan using the data of individual cases available from local governments in Japan . We also analyzed the characteristics of cases that generated secondary cases to define the factors associated with secondary transmission . Methods Data collection The Japanese government included COVID - 19 as a designated infectious disease on January 2020 . As a consequence , physicians have a legal mandate to report all confirmed cases to local public health centers ( Furuse et al . , 2020a ) . Public health nurses in public health centers interview confirmed cases based on the National Institute of Infectious Diseases guidelines ( Imamura et al . , 2021 ) . They collect demographic data , clinical information , history of 8 high - risk activities such as traveling to affected areas , contact with confirmed COVID - 19 cases , and visits to high - risk venues using standardized forms . This data is collected for the 14 days before the onset of symptoms . Local governments compile the data on all confirmed cases , and most release this information online on a daily basis . The data are different between local governments , but most local governments include age , gender , identification number , and epidemiological link . We collected and collated this data for the analysis . Definition of phases We analyzed the data of confirmed cases between January 15 , 2020 and August 31 , 2020 . This period included two waves , which were divided into four phases based on the epidemic curve , namely the increasing ( phase 1 : January 15 to April 13 ) and decreasing ( phase 2 : April 14 to May 24 ) phases of the first wave , and the increasing ( phase 3 : May 25 to August 6 ) and decreasing ( phase 4 : August 7 to August 31 ) phases of the second wave ( Figure 1 ) . The levels of interventions differed between the phases . During phase 1 , the government implemented limited control measures , such as school closures and cancellations of mass - gathering events . In response to the surge in cases , the government declared a state of emergency for seven prefectures , including Tokyo and Osaka , on April 7 , 2020 , and extended it to all prefectures on April 16 , 2020 . During the state of emergency , the government requested people to stay at home unless necessary , and people ' s compliance was high during this period until the state of emergency was lifted from all prefectures on May 25 , 2020 ( phase 2 ) . The number of newly confirmed cases dropped in May ; however , the transmission of infection continued in nightlife areas in metropolitan cities such as Tokyo . The number of cases increased in June and July until it peaked on August 7 , 2020 ( phase 3 ) ( Nagata et al . , 2021 ) . Although the government did not 9 declare another state of emergency at that time , specific interventions targeting nightlife areas were implemented , and newly confirmed cases decreased until August 31 , 2020 ( phase 4 ) . Definition of primary and secondary cases We defined the primary and secondary cases as follows : A primary case had the earliest date of onset among epidemiologically linked cases , if the duration between the onset dates of primary and secondary cases was less than 15 days based on the serial interval reported in previous studies ( Nishiura et al . , 2020a ) . If the onset date was unavailable or the case had no symptoms , we used the confirmation date or reporting date instead of the onset date . If two or more cases had the same earliest onset date , we defined the case with an earlier confirmed date as the primary case . For clusters comprising several cases with primary exposure reported at a common event or venue , we considered the case that had the earliest onset date as a primary case and other cases as secondary cases if the onset date of the case was ≤7 days after the onset of the primary case . If the onset date was unknown or the cases in a cluster were asymptomatic , we regarded those cases as secondary cases if the confirmed date was ≤7 days after the confirmation of the primary case . Inclusion and exclusion criteria We analyzed the frequency of secondary transmission in primary cases reported between January 15 , 2020 and August 31 , 2020 . However , we included those cases identified as 10 secondary cases in September 2020 , if their corresponding primary cases occurred by August 31 , 2020 . We only included primary cases with no identified exposure to calculate the frequency of secondary transmission for two reasons . First , it was difficult to identify the primary and secondary cases for the cases in a cluster which could have had more than one generation of transmission . Second , individuals with a contact history with the previously identified cases were likely to have practiced precautionary measures , such as self - quarantine , before testing positive for COVID - 19 . Although there was a certain degree of consistency in the data released by the local governments , there were some variations , especially regarding contact history , primarily due to privacy concerns . Thus , we imposed restrictions on which prefectures and phases were included based on the reporting detail regarding contact history . Specifically , we used two criteria to evaluate the level of the released contact history : 1 ) the proportion of cases with an identified source of infection ( cut - off 1 ) , and 2 ) the proportion of cases with a disclosed source of infection among cases with an identified source of infection ( cut - off 2 ) . We used ≥25 % for cut - off 1 and ≥75 % for cut - off 2 for the principal analysis ( Supplementary Figure 1 ) . We also analyzed the data using different cut - off values for the sensitivity analysis . We also excluded cases of international arrivals to avoid underestimating the secondary transmission frequency , considering the requirement of 14 - day quarantine after arrival . Statistical analysis We analyzed the observed distribution of secondary cases by calculating the number of secondary cases per primary case by fitting a negative binomial distribution by maximum 11 likelihood . We calculated the reproductive number ( R ) from the mean of the negative binomial distribution fit to the observed distribution of secondary cases and the degree of transmission heterogeneity from the corresponding dispersion parameter ( k ) as described elsewhere ( Lloyd - Smith et al . , 2005 ) . Furthermore , we employed Markov chain Monte Carlo method to obtain the joint density estimates and marginal density estimates for R and k . We analyzed the number of secondary cases stratified by phase , age , gender , presence of symptoms at confirmation , and days from onset to confirmation . We calculated the odds ratios ( ORs ) by 1 ) comparing the proportion of cases that caused secondary cases with that of cases which did not cause secondary transmission , and 2 ) comparing the proportion of cases that caused 1 – 4 secondary cases with that of cases which generated ≥5 secondary cases by a logistic regression model . The cutoff was ≥5 because super - spreading events are generally considered transmission to more than 4 – 6 people . In each stratified group , the group with the largest number of cases , such as phase 3 , those aged 20 – 29 years , male , symptomatic at confirmation , and within two days from onset to confirmation , was selected as the reference group . Adjusted ORs were calculated by adjusting for phase , age , presence of symptoms at confirmation , and days between onset and confirmation . All analyses were performed using R ( R Foundation for Statistical Computing , Vienna , Austria . URL https : / / www . R - project . org / ) . Results Overdispersion of secondary transmission 12 We collected data on 67 , 761 confirmed COVID - 19 cases in Japan between January 15 , 2020 and August 31 , 2020 , from local government websites , including demographic and epidemiological information . Among them , 46 , 481 cases had no identified exposure . From these 46 , 481 cases , we excluded the 30 , 010 cases reported by prefectures during the specific phases in which the contact history information was limited . The remaining 16 , 471 cases were included as primary cases for the principal analysis of secondary transmission . We found that 76 . 7 % ( 12 , 638 / 16 , 471 ) of the cases did not generate secondary cases ( Figure 2 ) . Contrastingly , 21 . 9 % ( 3 , 604 / 16 , 471 ) of the cases caused 1 – 4 secondary cases , and 1 . 4 % ( 229 / 16 , 471 ) generated ≥5 secondary cases . We fitted the negative binomial distribution and obtained an R of 0 . 47 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0 . 45 – 0 . 49 ) and k of 0 . 23 ( 95 % CI , 0 . 22 – 0 . 25 ) . The expected proportion of cases accounting for 80 % of all COVID - 19 transmission was 13 . 3 % ( 95 % CI , 12 . 8 % – 13 . 9 % ) . While k was low for all age groups throughout the entire period , R varied for each age group in each phase . Particularly , the R for those aged 0 – 19 years was low in phases 1 and 2 ( 0 . 24 and 0 . 20 , respectively ) before increasing in phase 3 ( 0 . 45 ) . In individuals aged ≥70 years , R fell from phase 1 to phase 2 ( from 0 . 83 to 0 . 39 , respectively ) and increased from phase 3 to phase 4 ( from 0 . 49 to 0 . 70 , respectively ) ( Table 1 ) . When we excluded cases associated with healthcare and other facilities , k increased in all phases except for phase 3 , and the R decreased , particularly in those aged ≥70 years . However , the change was minimal in phase 3 , suggesting a limited contribution of health care and other facilities in phase 3 . The overall patterns of R and k in each phase were the same after excluding cases associated with healthcare and other facilities ( Supplementary Table 2 ) . For the sensitivity analysis , we calculated k using different inclusion criteria and found that it was not higher than 0 . 5 in all phases under different criteria ( Supplementary Table 3 ) . 13 Changes in demographic patterns of primary and secondary cases The demographic characteristics of the primary and secondary cases differed significantly by phase ( Figure 3 ) . In phase 1 , the most common transmissions were from males aged 50 – 59 years to females in the same age group , and between males aged 20 – 29 years . In phase 2 , the most common transmissions were also from males aged 50 – 59 years to females in the same age group ; however , transmissions from males aged 60 – 69 years to females in the same age group increased . In phase 3 , transmission between males aged 20 – 29 years was significant . In phase 4 , the proportion of transmissions from various age groups , especially from the elderly corresponding to both genderes , increased . When age and gender were analyzed separately , most of the primary cases were identified among those aged 20 – 39 years and 40 – 69 years . However , the proportion of patients aged 40 – 69 years was the highest in phases 1 and 2 ( 55 . 0 % and 58 . 0 % , respectively ) , while the proportion of patients aged 20 – 39 years was the highest in phase 3 ( 57 . 4 % ) . In phase 4 , the proportions of those aged 20 – 39 years and 40 – 69 years were approximately the same ( 38 . 2 % and 38 . 3 % , respectively ) . Regarding gender , males were more likely to be primary cases throughout the entire period ( 60 . 7 % ) ( Supplementary Tables 4 and 5 ) . Characteristics of cases generating secondary transmissions Compared to phase 3 , the proportion of cases generating secondary cases was lower in other phases , whereas there was no significant difference in the proportion of cases generating ≥5 cases between phases 1 and 3 ( Figure 4 , Supplement Table 7 ) . Compared to those aged 20 – 29 years , those aged 40 – 49 to 80 – 89 years were more likely to cause a secondary transmission . However , there was no significant difference in transmission to five or more people between the 14 age groups . Children aged 0 – 9 years were less likely to generate secondary cases , but were more likely to generate ≥5 secondary cases ; however , this finding was not statistically significant . If cases had no symptoms at confirmation , they were less likely to generate secondary cases . Cases diagnosed within 2 days from onset were significantly less likely to generate secondary cases , although the likelihood of generating ≥5 secondary cases was lower in those diagnosed later . We did not find any gender - related differences in the frequency of generating secondary transmission . Discussion We found that just over threequarters of the included cases did not generate any secondary cases during the entire study period ( Table 1 ) , which is in line with previous reports from other countries ( Adam et al . , 2020 ; Laxminarayan et al . , 2020 ; Sun et al . , 2021 ) . All sensitivity analyses showed relatively low values of k ( < 0 . 5 ) in all phases , suggesting a high possibility of extinction for most transmission chains ( Lloyd - Smith et al . , 2005 ) . In contrast , a study in Korea showed that k was larger in the later epidemic period ( Lim et al . , 2021 ) . There are two possible reasons for the difference between Japan and Korea . First , in Japan , cluster - based approach was implemented from the beginning and reflected k in all phases . Second , in Korea , religious gatherings , which may have contributed to the overdispersion in the early stages , were banned in later phases . We believe that Japan ' s cluster - based approach focusing on super - spreading can suppress transmission because most infected individuals do not contribute to transmission and sustained transmission is unlikely to occur without super - spreading events ( Endo et al . , 2020 ) ( Sneppen et al . , 2021 ) . 15 Analysis showed that R was estimated to be < 1 for all periods , even during the increase phase ( phase 1 and 3 ) . This is inconsistent with the effective reproduction number estimated from the epidemic curve , since our estimation indicates how many secondary cases were observed on average from the primary cases with no identified exposure . Our data indicated that COVID - 19 transmission in Japan during the first two waves was driven mainly by individuals aged 20 – 69 years ; 80 % of primary cases causing secondary transmission belonged to these age groups . However , the predominant age group comprising primary cases shifted from middle - aged adults ( 40 – 69 years ) in phase 1 to younger adults ( 20 – 39 years ) in phase 3 . Studies in other countries have shown a similar demographic transition ( Monod et al . , 2021 ; Oster et al . , 2020 ) . Although the proportion of primary cases generating secondary cases was highest among those aged 20 – 39 years , secondary transmission was more common in those aged 40 – 89 years ( Figure 4 and Supplementary Table 6 ) . A higher rate of secondary transmission in older age groups has been reported in other countries , which may be due to the high viral load in these age groups ( Hu et al . , 2021 ; Jones et al . , 2021 ; To et al . , 2020 ) . Additionally , we found that the absence of symptoms at the confirmation was associated with a low secondary transmission rate , as reported in other studies ( Buitrago - Garcia et al . , 2020 ; Heavey et al . , 2020 ; Sayampanathan et al . , 2021 ) . People in older age groups are more likely to develop typical clinical symptoms , such as fever and cough ( Davies et al . , 2020 ) . This may be another possible reason for higher secondary transmission in older age groups , as suggested by a modeling study ( Chen et al . , 2021 ) . Our data showed that most transmissions occurred between younger age groups in earlier phases of each wave ( phases 1 and 3 ) , and that increased transmission between different age 16 groups occurred in later stages ( phases 2 and 4 ) . This resulted in more cases among elderly individuals ( ≥70 years ) during the later stages ( phase 2 and phase 4 ) . Our data also indicated that children aged 0 – 9 years comprised only a small proportion of primary cases ( 4 % ) . However , R for those aged 0 – 19 years was higher in phases 3 and 4 than in phases 1 and 2 , indicating that the transmission from this age group increased during this period . These changes were possibly caused by the reopening of schools in phase 3 after the universal closure of schools during almost all of phases 1 and 2 . However , our data showed that children did not play a major role in increasing community transmission even after schools reopened . We also found that secondary transmission was less common in children aged 0 – 9 years . A low transmission rate of COVID - 19 in children has been reported in our previous study ( T . Imamura et al . , 2021 ) and other studies ( Zhu et al . , 2021 ) . These data are consistent with other studies that have not found children to be major drivers of community transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 ( Davies et al . , 2020 ) . Identifying and monitoring the age group that principally drives transmission is vital in order to implement more specific interventions . Although our data clearly indicated that individuals aged 20 – 39 years had a predominant role in transmission during the second wave in Japan , implementing effective measures targeting these young adults is challenging ; they are less likely to develop typical or severe symptom ( Davies et al . , 2020 ) , which may result in under - diagnosis . Notably , some seroepidemiological studies have shown that children and young adults have greater under - ascertainment rates ( Havers et al . , 2020 ; Pollán et al . , 2020 ; Yoshiyama et al . , 2021 ) . Moreover , implementing health promotion strategies to induce behavioral change is particularly challenging in this age group ( Ki et al . , 2020 ) , and data from other countries 17 indicate that it is also difficult to achieve high vaccine coverage in this age group ( Murphy et al . , 2021 ) . Our data also showed that males , particularly those aged 20 – 59 years , had a more significant role in transmission even though there was no observed difference in the frequency of generating secondary transmission by gender . The dominant role of males in COVID - 19 transmission has been reported in other studies ( Galasso et al . , 2020 ) ; biological , social , and behavioral factors likely contribute to this difference ( Capraro and Barcelo , 2020 ) . There were more transmissions to the elderly from younger age groups as well as elderly - to - elderly transmission in the later phases of each wave . This is consistent with a previous study that reported community cluster outbreaks among the elderly in Japan ( Furuse et al . , 2021 ) . Since the most severe cases occur in the elderly ( Driscoll et al . , 2021 ) , interventions focusing on preventing infection in older age groups are essential to minimize the impact of COVID - 19 . When cases were detected within two days after illness onset , they were less likely to cause secondary transmission ( Figure 4 ) . A previous study showed that infectiousness peaked around illness onset ( He et al . , 2020 ) , and that the possibility of SARS - CoV - 2 isolation decreased a few days after illness onset ( Wölfel et al . , 2020 ) . Our data indicate that the early detection and isolation of cases are useful in suppressing transmission , as reported previously ( Pung et al . , 2021 ) . However , delays in case isolation after five days following illness onset would not substantially increase the chance of secondary transmission . Our study has several limitations . First , since we used contact tracing data on public domain , case , contact , and cluster ascertainment might have affected the results . In particular , before May 29 , 2020 , testing was only done when a close contact presented symptoms , later , testing of all close contacts was recommended , regardless of whether they presented symptoms . Therefore , it is possible that transmission pairs were underestimated especially during phase 1 18 and 2 in our study . In contrast , during phases 3 and 4 , with high case numbers , there may have been underestimation due to the reduction in contact tracing caused by the increased workload of public health centers . Under - reporting generally leads to an underestimation of R , but overestimation of k , especially when super - spreading events are missed ( Blumberg and Lloyd - Smith , 2013 ; Endo et al . , 2020 ) . Thus , the overdispersion of secondary transmission would remain unchanged even after accounting for the effects of these biases . Second , the data released by the local governments were inconsistent , particularly the data on close contacts , and might be subject to certain biases depending on the quality of the interviews . We addressed this as much as possible by limiting the cases to those from municipalities where the quality of data on epidemiological links was considered to maintain a certain level . Still , under - ascertainment of transmission chains was likely to exist . In this case , as mentioned above , R is generally considered to be underestimated , and k overestimated . In addition , we excluded many cases from prefectures without sufficient information . In particular , all cases in Tokyo were excluded , however , other prefectures with large populations , such as Aichi , Osaka , and Fukuoka , and many small prefectures were included ( Supplementary Table 1 , Supplementary Figure 4 ) , suggesting that our study has some generalizability to all of Japan . Third , primary and secondary cases decided by our criteria may not reflect valid infector - infectee pairs . However , if we had used different definitions of primary and secondary cases with different inclusion criteria , the results would not have changed substantially . The consistency of our findings regarding the multiple sensitivity analyses strengthens the robustness of this study . Fourth , because our study period included only the first and second waves of the outbreak in Japan , it does not reflect the transmission characteristics of newly emerged variants of SARS - CoV - 2 , such as the alpha and delta variants . The new variants are now predominant in the community transmission of SARS - 19 CoV - 2 in Japan , potentially changing transmission patterns from those observed in this study . A Korean study reported no significant difference in delta compared to pre - delta in terms of the likelihood of super - spreading events ( Ryu et al . , 2022 ) . However , there is still limited empirical evidence using country - level data on the delta , and future studies are warranted . In conclusion , this study estimates the frequency of secondary transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 in Japan , and its overdispersion was observed in the whole period up to the first and second wave . We also revealed the temporal changes in the predominant population in the transmission chain and the characteristics of people who generated the secondary transmissions ; further interventions should be performed based on these characteristics .
