BioSyst . , 2017 , 13 , 1280 What shapes eukaryotic transcriptional bursting ? Damien Nicolas , Nick E . Phillips and Felix Naef * Isogenic cells in a common environment present a large degree of heterogeneity in gene expression . Part of this variability is attributed to transcriptional bursting : the stochastic activation and inactivation of promoters that leads to the discontinuous production of mRNA . The diversity in bursting patterns displayed by diﬀerent genes suggests the existence of a connection between bursting and gene regulation . Experimental strategies such as single - molecule RNA FISH , MS2 - GFP or short - lived protein reporters allow the quantification of transcriptional bursting and the comparison of bursting kinetics between conditions , allowing therefore the identification of molecular mechanisms modulating transcriptional bursting . In this review we recapitulate the impact on transcriptional bursting of diﬀerent molecular aspects of transcription such as the chromatin environment , nucleosome occupancy , histone modifications , the number and aﬃnity of regulatory elements , DNA looping and transcription factor availability . More specifically , we examine their role in tuning the burst size or the burst frequency . While some molecular mechanisms involved in transcription such as histone marks can aﬀect every aspect of bursting , others predominantly influence the burst size ( e . g . the number and aﬃnity of cis - regulatory elements ) or frequency ( e . g . transcription factor availability ) . Transcriptional bursting In most biological systems , genetically identical cells in a common environment display great variability in the expression levels of their gene products 1 , 2 ( Fig . 1A ) , and transcription is a source of this gene expression noise . 1 , 3 Indeed , this cellular process consists in a complex and tightly ordered sequence of biochemical reactions , 4 , 5 and phenomena such as low molecular concentrations , diﬀusion or transcription factor dynamics naturally bestow randomness on it . 6 – 8 Part of this variability can be explained by factors extrinsic to the gene itself , such as the cell size , the cell - cycle state , or the concentration of certain factors involved in transcription . 9 – 11 However , an additional important source of transcriptional noise arises from genes being transcribed irregularly , with RNA produc - tion greatly fluctuating over time ( Fig . 1B ) .

BioSyst . , 2017 , 13 , 1280 - - 1290 | 1281 is often subject to a pulsatile pattern and occurs mainly during short , often intense periods referred as transcriptional bursts followed by longer periods of transcription inactivity . 1 , 12 Trans - criptional bursting , together with additional probabilistic pro - cesses underlying gene expression , such as post - transcriptional regulation 13 or translation , 14 will contribute to generate diversity in isogenic cells . 15 Interdisciplinary approaches have integrated quantitative measurements of gene expression with mathematical models in order to understand the origins and consequences of transcriptional bursting . Measurements of gene expression can be broadly categorized as either static or time resolved ( often also termed live ) , and the mathematical approach will depend on the type of data used as an input . We will now briefly review these mathematical approaches that allow mechanistic insight to be obtained from gene expression data . Understanding transcriptional bursting using mathematical models The simplest conceivable model of transcription would involve mRNA production at a constant rate and mRNA degradation proportional to the number of mRNA molecules . At the most detailed level , solving the ensuing stochastic model leads to the number of mRNA molecules following a Poisson distribution at steady state , which is a unique distribution with a variance equal to the mean ( Fig . 1C , grey distribution ) . However , princi - pally but not exclusively in higher eukaryotes , transcript distribu - tions of many genes are too widely spread to follow a Poisson distribution 17 – 19 ( Fig . 1C , blue distribution ) . A widely used model to account for this observation proposes that the promoter stochastically switches between active and inactive transcriptional states . 19 – 22 Mathematically this can be represented with a ‘tele - graph’ model , which assumes that the promoters can be in two different states : a transcriptionally active ‘‘on - state’’ , or a silent ‘‘off - state’’ characterized by a lack of transcriptional activity . 23 The telegraph model has one parameter describing the rate of mRNA degradation and three parameters describing the rate of mRNA production : the rate of switching from an ‘on’ to ‘off’ state ( and vice versa ) and the average rate of mRNA transcription whilst in the ‘on’ state . While the simple model could only produce the Poisson distribution , the telegraph model can produce mRNA distributions with a variety of shapes and mRNA copy number . 18 , 24 For example , when the ‘on’ states are very short the mRNA distribution has a long tail and a high ( super - Poissonian ) variance ( Fig . 1C , blue distribution ) . Alternatively , when promoter state transition rates are low and cells spend a long time in the ‘on’ or ‘off’ state then the distribution will have two peaks ( bimodality ) . 18 The shape of the mRNA distribution therefore reveals information about the underlying dynamics of promoter activation , and hence the telegraph model is a useful tool for studying transcriptional bursting .

Isogenic NIH 3T3 cells display large variability in their cellular number of transcripts ( white dots ) , as exemplified here with smRNA - FISH labeling Bmal1 mRNA ( Nicolas et al . , unpublished data ) .

( C ) Comparison of transcripts per cell in a population between a discrete probability distribution ( Poisson , grey ) and a stochastic regime ( Bursting , blue ) . When the mean number of transcript per cell is the same ( m P = m B ) , the variance is larger in the bursting condition ( s P o s B ) . ( D ) Schematic of the promoter activity of a bursting gene . The promoter switches between active ( On ) or silent ( Oﬀ ) transcriptional states . RNAs production ( blue bars ) only occurs during the active periods and defines the burst size b . In a bursting regime where the lifetime of the on state is short compared to the oﬀ state and mRNA half life , and the number of transcripts produced per burst is large , the average number of mRNA per cell m is the product of the burst site b , the burst frequency f and the mRNA half - life t m . The burst frequency is inversely proportional to the length of the silent period , and can be expressed as the inverse of the coeﬃcient of variation CV 2 . The burst size is expressed as the mean number of transcripts divided by the frequency . Review Molecular BioSystems P ub li s h e d on 02 J un e 2017 .

BioSyst . , 2017 , 13 , 1280 - - 1290 This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2017 Measuring bursting parameters directly is challenging , and the telegraph model is often used to estimate parameters by fitting measurements of mRNA copy number at a single - cell level , predominantly using single - molecule RNA FISH ( smRNA - FISH ) data , described below . 19 , 25 – 28 The telegraph parameters can be estimated by explicitly calculating the likelihood of observing the data for given parameters . 29 Alternatively , the parameters can be estimated by minimizing the distance between the model distribution and the data 25 or by comparing moments ( mean , variance and skewness ) of the mRNA distri - bution with model predictions . 23 Estimating these parameters has led to biological understanding in a variety of contexts , such as identifying which rates change as cells undergo fate transitions during development , 30 and predicting quantitative responses to genetic and environmental perturbations . 31 The telegraph model has also been fitted using single - cell RNA - seq data to investigate the effect of histone modifications on transcriptional bursting in embryonic stem cells . 32 Under the assumptions that on - states are considerably briefer than oﬀ - states and mRNA life - time , and that the number of transcripts per burst ( burst size ) is large , the normalized burst frequency ( in units of events per transcript life time ) and burst size can both be estimated using the mean and variance of the mRNA copy numbers alone . 29 , 33 The normalized burst frequency is then inversely proportional to the coeﬃcient of variation squared ( standard deviation / mean ) 2 , while the burst size is proportional to the mean number of transcripts divided by the burst frequency ( Fig . 1D ) . These relationships can be useful to provide rapid estimates of the burst size and frequency ( in e . g . smRNA - FISH data ) , and they also provide a simpler conceptual framework for understanding how the bursting parameters control the noise in the system . For a more refined analysis , assuming only that on - states are brief on the scale of the transcript life - time , the steady state distribution becomes a negative binomial distribution , 19 whose parameters can be readily estimated using maximum likelihood . Finally , the transcriptional bursting parameters can also be inferred using live - cell imaging data ( reviewed in ref . 34 ) . Briefly , these methods typically use live - cell data to calculate the likelihood of moving between successive time points in the time series given the telegraph parameters . These techniques include Bayesian methods that work by calculating the ‘posterior’ probability of parameters . This posterior is proportional to the likelihood of the time series given the telegraph parameters multiplied by the ‘prior’ , which is the probability of the telegraph parameters before seeing any data . It may be that the posterior is quite insensitive to changes in parameters , so statistical sampling techniques allow one to estimate the telegraph parameters by providing both the maximum posterior and also their associated uncertainties . 35 – 37 Live - cell imaging methods have elucidated transcriptional mechanisms that are difficult to quantify in fixed cells , such as the existence of a ‘refractory period’ in the off - state preventing promoters from reactivation shortly after the preceding burst . 35 – 37 In addition to the two - state telegraph model these methods have also been extended to consider multiple intermediate inactive states before expression reactivation 37 and discontinuous transitions between multiple different levels of transcriptional activity . 38 – 41 A panoply of approaches to monitor transcriptional bursting Over the past years , several emerging experimental approaches have allowed the monitoring of transcriptional bursting . Among the most instructive ones , smRNA - FISH provides the distributions of both nascent and mature transcripts per cell in fixed conditions , 19 , 42 and can be combined with quantifications of the number of RNAs sitting on the transcription site ( TS ) . 27 , 28 Transcription can also be ‘directly’ monitored in real - time using the MS2 - GFP approach . After introduction of specific stem loops in the transcripts to recruit fluorescently tagged viral capsid proteins , nascent RNAs at the TS appear as a fluorescent dots which intensity fluctuates with the promoter activity . 20 , 43 Short - lived protein reporters have also been successful at monitoring transcriptional activity of genes in real - time . 35 , 36 , 44 Indeed , when combined with modeling , the transcriptional state of the gene can be inferred from the destabilized reporter signal . These diﬀerent approaches highlighted the frequent character of transcriptional bursting , which was observed in every organism , from prokaryotes to yeasts and higher eukaryotes . While in bacteria pulsatile transcription seems to be a pheno - menon of rare occurrence 6 , 42 , 45 that possibly directly arises from the formation of positive supercoiled DNA following the passaging of RNA Polymerase , 46 , 47 it seems to be more wide - spread in systems with higher levels of chromatin organization . Notably , in higher eukaryotes transcriptional bursting appears to be a quasi - universal phenomenon governing the expression of a majority of genes observed in cultured cells , 28 , 36 tissues 25 and small organisms . 48 – 50 These studies highlighted that different genes can display dramatically different transcriptional bursting kinetics . 25 , 28 , 36 , 50 , 51 Typically , across mammalian systems , the burst frequency of expressed genes ranges from a burst every 30 minutes to up to 10 hours , and the burst size from one to several hundreds of transcripts . 52 This diversity in transcrip - tional bursting profiles observed across genes likely reflects the complexity of their regulation and the variety of molecular mechanisms involved in tuning gene expression at the transcrip - tional level . However , how molecular aspects of transcription directly influence the bursting specificities of the genes has long remained elusive . 53 , 54 Over the past years , considerable efforts were made to modulate transcriptional bursting and identify its molecular mechanisms in higher eukaryote systems . In the following sections , we will non - exhaustively review such studies , summarizing their main discoveries , while trying to decrypt general emerging concepts for which molecular aspects of transcription correlate with specific consequences for bursting ( Fig . 2 ) and ( Table 1 ) . The local genomic environment In the challenging task of identifying mechanisms shaping trans - criptional bursting , a valid approach consists in stably integrating a constant reporter at diﬀerent genomic location to assess the role of local chromatin environment on transcription dynamics .

BioSyst . , 2017 , 13 , 1280 - - 1290 | 1283 A tactic to obtain a broad range of integration sites consists in using a lentiviral vector in which the LTR viral promoter drives the expression of a fluorescent reporter . The expression specificities of each clone are then extracted from protein or mRNA distributions , 19 , 42 or by real - time monitoring of the reporter expression . 44 These studies commonly observed that the mean expression level and the noise can both considerably vary between the diﬀerent integration sites . 29 , 44 , 55 , 56 However , estimating the bursting kinetics yielded diﬀerent scenarios , where either a modulation of the burst size only , 56 , 57 or both the burst size and frequency 29 , 44 can explain the expression diﬀerences between the clones . Yet , these diﬀerent interpreta - tions could be caused by disparities in the observed expression ranges . Indeed , burst frequency seems to vary the most at low expression levels , whereas burst size predominantly changes between clones in the upper expression level range . 44 These observations suggest a model in which the microenvironment at the integration site primarily aﬀect expression by acting on the burst frequency , while above a certain threshold only burst size can be further modulated to reach the highest expression levels . Other studies also assessed the impact of integration site on transcriptional bursting by integrating a limited number of synthetic promoters into mammalian chromatin . 37 , 58 In both cases , the mean expression levels only slightly diﬀered between the clones , but these diﬀerences could mainly be attributed to burst size variations . In contrast , the diﬀerent expression levels observed upon random integration of a CMV promoter driving a fluorescent reporter at diﬀerent locus was most likely explained by variations of burst frequency . 59 Thus , similarly to yeast , 60 transcription dynamics in higher eukaryotes are highly sensitive to the local environment of the gene . Although diﬀerent studies do not fully agree on the impact that the integration site has on transcriptional kinetics , these dissimilarities likely reflect the vast complexity and diversity of genomic environments characterizing mammalian genomes , 5 , 61 rather than being attributed to technical diver - gences between the studies . Nucleosome occupancy and specific chromatin marks While random genomic integration of reporters provides limited insight into the characteristics of the chromatin environment at the integration site , it is also possible to directly assess the role of nucleosome occupancy or specific histone marks in shaping expression noise . Importance of nucleosomes in transcriptional bursting was already observed in yeasts . 62 – 64 The alternation between different nucleosome configurations detected by electron microscopy on the promoter region of the PHO5 gene was found to correlate with properties of the stochastic gene activity . 62 These variations of nucleosome occupancy are a source of expression noise in the PHO5 gene , 63 , 65 and likely participate in its regulation through changes in burst frequency . 62 Inspired by this previous work , a study performing DNase hypersensitivity assays in mamma - lian cells to evaluate the chromatin accessibility demonstrated that noisier genes have denser nucleosome occupancy , and found a correlation between the amount of nucleosome at the transcription start site ( TSS ) and the promoter on - rate transition . 29 Indeed , genes with lower nucleosome density around the TSS seem to switch more readily to the transcrip - tionally active state .

Limited evidence has directly linked the presence of histone marks with specific transcriptional bursting behaviors . Still , in Dictyostelium , H3K4 methylation states are major determinants of transcriptional kinetics propagation , notably the frequency and duration of the bursts , from a cell to its daughters during division . 66 Among other histone marks , the role of acetylation in shaping transcriptional bursting was more intensively studied , mainly by blocking histone deacetylation using Trichostatin A ( TSA ) . Although this tactic provokes genome - wide modifications of the chromatin landscape and thus limits the causal attribution of expression changes to the acetylation state of the promoter in focus , it presents a straightforward initial approach . In diﬀerent systems histone deacetylase inhibition displayed various trans - criptional bursting modulations , suggesting that the eﬀect is highly gene - dependent . Notably , the bursting pattern of the endogenous NcKap1 genes was found to remain unaﬀected by altered acetylation states . 36 In other cases , TSA treatment aﬀected the burst size , either by lengthening of the active period as observed in the Prolactin promoter , 35 or by increasing the transcription rate as observed in HIV promoters randomly integrated into human lymphocytes , 44 in the endogenous Prl2c3 gene or in synthetic promoters . 36 In an additional study , increased histone acetylation levels aﬀected the burst frequency by strongly shortening the silent periods in CMV promoters inserted at various genomic locations in chicken cells . 59 Inter - estingly , TSA treatment also abridged the length of refractory period observed after activation of the Bmal1 circadian promoter , suggesting that some of the rate - limiting steps the promoter undergoes before reactivation specifically involve modifications of histone acetylation . 37 To summarize , it appears that nucleosome occupancy , notably at the TSS , could be a key regulator of the transcrip - tional bursting frequency . Concerning the marks present on histones spreading along the gene and its promoter , the first evidences point towards gene - specific implications in bursting regulation . DNA regulatory elements Considering their major role in transcription regulation , it seems obvious that core promoters and other DNA regulatory sequences have a predominant function in shaping trans - cription dynamics . This can be observed by simply expres - sing a similar reporter at the same genomic location from diﬀerent promoters , which results in considerably dissimilar bursting behavior with notably marked diﬀerences in the firing rate . 67 Identification of DNA elements influencing expression noise can classically be achieved in two diﬀerent ways : by monitoring the expression dynamics in altered DNA contexts , 36 , 68 , 69 or by associating expression behaviors with presence of specific regulatory elements . 37 , 70 Indeed , both yeast and mammalian genes showing correlations in expression variability often share common transcription factors binding motifs in their promoter regions . 70 – 72 The most striking example is TATA - boxes . Promoters containing this regulatory motif typically display increased expres - sion noise . 70 , 73 , 74 In mammalian systems , this phenomenon is observed genome - wide , and seems to be linked with absence of refractory period . 37 An alternative approach to assess the implication of DNA regulatory elements on noise and more specifically transcrip - tional bursting is to compare the expression profiles after promoter mutations . By working on the diﬀerent latency phenotypes of the HIV virus as a model of stochastic gene expression , it was observed that the cis - regulatory elements present in the viral promoter have specific impacts on cell - to - cell heterogeneity , with individual binding sites either involved in expression stabilization or in promoting expres - sion variability . 75 Work done on synthetic promoters also highlighted the importance of promoter architecture in trans - criptional bursting . Increasing the number of transcription factor binding sites in an inducible promoter led to markedly larger burst sizes . 19 Consistently , additional binding sites for a synthetic TALE transcription activators around the TSS increased the burst size through prolonged burst duration . 27 Similarly , it was observed that more NF – Y binding sites ( CCAAT - boxes ) on the promoter significantly increases the burst size of the gene , and to a smaller extent the burst frequency by reducing the off - time . 36 Mutant versions of the same CCAAT - boxes reveled that lowering the binding aﬃnity of NF – Y can either reduce the burst size or the burst frequency depending on the promoter context ( the presence of 1 or 2 CCAAT - boxes respectively ) . 36 In Dictyostelium , point mutations on the TATA - box at the actin5 locus affect the burst size by preventing the gene to access higher initiation rates . 38 More recently , research has started to look further away from the core promoter , and tested the implication of distal regulatory DNA sequences in shaping transcriptional bursting . Hence , the role of enhancers has been investigated using two diﬀerent elegant approaches . The first one combined smRNA - FISH with manipulations forcing or preventing the formation of a loop between the b - globin gene and its LCR enhancer , 68 and observed that loop formation strongly influence the burst frequency while having only a minor impact on burst size . Using the MS2 - GFP system in living Drosophila embryos , very similar conclusions were drawn by analyzing the impact of diﬀerent enhancer constructs on the expression of the sna developmental gene , as changing both the position and sequence of the enhancer region led mainly to burst frequency modulation . 69 These diﬀerent studies clearly highlight the contribution of DNA regulatory elements in defining gene expression noise . Even if the direct impacts on transcriptional busting can be various and may reflect specificities of regulatory motives , it appears that the number and the aﬃnity of proximal elements mainly influence the burst size , whereas formation of distal loops seem to aﬀect burst frequency .

BioSyst . , 2017 , 13 , 1280 - - 1290 This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2017 Bursting in stimulated expression conditions Transcriptional bursting mechanisms can also be assessed in perturbed conditions by modulating the activity of transcrip - tion factors , or less specifically by activating regulatory pathways through application of external stimuli to the cells . Interestingly , and despite the variety of experimental systems , a great majority of these studies conclude that stimulation aﬀects the frequency of the bursts , although sometimes combined with additional changes in other bursting parameters . Notably , predominant changes in burst frequency were observed by adjusting endo - genous human c - Fos expression levels through diverse external stimuli acting through diﬀerent pathways . 27 Work done on a steroid - responsive synthetic promoter also highlighted that control of expression upon induction was achieved through dose - dependent adjustment of the burst frequency . 58 Also in natural conditions , changes in burst frequency were found to dominate the expression modulation of key transcription factors during hematopoietic diﬀerentiation . 30 Since a similar eﬀect was observed upon manual alteration of Gata2 and Gfi1 levels , it is likely that variations in the concentrations of these upstream transcription factors directly impact the burst fre - quency of their downstream targets throughout diﬀerentiation . Similar observations were made in vivo in mouse liver : upregu - lation of two gluconeogenesis genes upon fasting was pre - dominantly achieved by increasing the burst frequency , although burst size was aﬀected to a smaller extent by changes in trans - cription rate . 25 Combined modulation of burst size and burst frequency were also observed in other systems . It is notably the case when comparing Nanog expression between serum and 2i conditions : the length of the silent period is reduced whereas the active period is lengthened in the culture conditions favoring pluripotency maintenance . 76 This conclusion slightly diﬀers from observations done in another study , where the decrease in heterogeneity observed in Nanog expression in 2i condition was only attributed to an increase in burst frequency . 51 The transcriptional response of the endogenous b - actin gene to serum also aﬀected both its burst frequency and size , since the number of active alleles together with the number of RNAs per TS increased upon stimulation . 77 Similarly , stimulating the Wnt pathway leads to increased on - rate , burst duration and burst intensity when transcriptional output is measured using the MS2 - GFP approach on a cyclinD1 reporter . 78 A possible explanation for the stimulation - induced modulation of burst size observed in concert with the characteristic changes in burst frequency could arise from the extensive work done in the HIV promoter system in response to TNF - a stimuli . First , it was observed both at the protein 56 and mRNA level 55 that increase in expression was achieved through variations of burst frequency . However , further observations done on a larger panel of reporters with wider expression range concluded that at higher expression levels , TNF - a stimulations could also aﬀect the burst size . 44 These observations support the existence of a threshold in expression level , above which burst frequency can no longer be increased , and higher transcription levels can only be achieved by increasing the burst size . This concept could explain the situa - tions where induction only leads to a modulation in burst size , assuming that the high expression levels involved exceed this threshold . For example , this scenario could concern the endo - genous mouse CTGF gene that massively responds to TGF - b or serum stimuli , 79 and a doxycycline - regulated highly expressed synthetic promoter . 19 Thus , in these cases where stimulation led to strong overexpression , predominantly the burst sizes were increased . Interestingly , further investigating the role of transcrip - tion factors in bursting modulation revealed that alternative and stronger variants of their activation domains led to increased burst size . 27 This observation could be compatible with the threshold argument , where the activation domain could bring the expression level above the critical expression level where burst size starts to vary instead of burst frequency . Discussion Multifactorial regulation of transcriptional bursting Following the discovery that transcriptional bursting in higher eukaryotes plays a widespread role in gene expression , the molecular mechanisms , despite numerous studies , remain fairly opaque . However , some general trends start to emerge that improve our understanding of how bursting is molecularly regulated ( Fig . 2 ) and ( Table 1 ) . Notably , and despite the variety of experimental systems probed , a majority of studies assessing changes in transcription dynamics upon stimulation demonstrated an important eﬀect on burst frequency . 25 , 27 , 56 , 58 These experimental approaches typically activate cellular pathways that eventually lead to changes in the availability of transcription factors involved in initiating early steps of transcription . The binding of these transcription factors to DNA can occur close to the TSS or at distal region , leading to the formation of DNA loops , also identified regulators of burst frequency . 68 , 69 Thus , the burst frequency may be directly proportional to the concentration of transcription activator . This would be consistent with observa - tions performed on the presence of transcription factors on gene promoters at steady state in the Drosophila embryo : fitting hunchback expression levels with the nuclear concentration of its activator Bcd indeed revealed that the regulation could be achieved by only aﬀecting burst frequency . 80 Binding of transcription activators to specific regions on the promoter may also be linked to the nucleosome clearance at the TSS . Indeed , the low nucleosome occupancy found to be linked with high burst frequency in both yeast 62 and mammalian cells 29 could result from the cascade of sequential events following transcription factor binding occurring at the promoter to initiate transcription . In addition to modulating the process of bursting at the frequency level , transcription factors can also , in some cases , participate in tuning bursting intensity by addi - tionally aﬀecting the burst size . 44 , 76 , 77 This possibility could be specific to some transcription factors , or reflect a more general complementary mode of transcription regulation when burst frequency reaches an upper limit and higher expression levels Molecular BioSystems Review P ub li s h e d on 02 J un e 2017 .

BioSyst . , 2017 , 13 , 1280 - - 1290 | 1287 can only be achieved by modulating alternative bursting para - meters . 44 Molecularly , this phenomenon could arise from saturating concentrations of transcription factor around the gene , provoking quasi - immediate reformation of the transcription initiation complex following its detachment after a transcription event . In contrast to the factors involved in transcription activation and mainly influencing burst frequency , others , notably DNA regulatory elements of the promoter , predominantly modulate the size of the bursts . 19 , 27 , 36 , 38 Indeed , the sequence of DNA regulatory elements influences transcription factor residency time rather than availability . Transcription factor residency time on DNA will stabilize transcription initiation complexes , thus allowing the production of a higher number of transcripts before it detaches from the promoter and provokes the switch back into the inactive state . Aside from transcription factors , the crucial role of nucleo - somes in shaping transcriptional bursting was unambiguously demonstrated by noticing absence of bursting when a gene was expressed from a plasmid with no chromatin context . 58 The general chromatin state of the gene , mainly assessed by random insertion of the same reporter at diﬀerent genomic locations , 29 , 44 , 56 , 57 primarily influences the burst size . Rather than participating in transcription initiation , the local chromatin environment is more likely involved in facilitating transcription eﬃciency once it is already initiated , therefore increasing the transcription yield in every on - phase . This is compatible with the recurrent pausing of RNA Polymerase II ( Pol II ) in proximity of nucleosomes observed in yeasts . 81 However , it is not yet possible to link specific histone modifications with a particular pattern of transcriptional bursting . Indeed , similar histone marks were shown to display various bursting responses that seem to be gene - specific . 35 , 36 , 44 This variety of responses may reflect the complexity of the chromatin microenvironments present in the genome and their specific roles in transcription modulation . 61 , 82 Unfortunately , the specific chro - matin state around the transgene was never assessed while asses - sing bursting specificities at diﬀerent integration sites . 29 , 44 , 56 , 57 Another aspect of transcriptional bursting likely involving nucleosomes is the presence of a refractory period charac - teristic to some genes that prevents their reactivation subse - quently to a burst . 35 , 37 , 83 The current understanding of this phenomenon is a model of transcriptional progression , where overcoming chromatin modifications specific to the repressed promoter state requires sequential events leading to intermediate chromatin states , the promoter being on its way for reactivation but unable to turn on before the completion of the process . 4 , 12 It seems , however , that most of the information describing the refractory pattern of a gene is contained in its promoter region , and thus primarily involves very local chromatin remodeling . 37 , 83 Although the molecular mechanisms listed here have been the most investigated ones in the context of bursting regulation , the participation of other phenomenon cannot be excluded . This could notably embrace transcriptional pausing or additional processes related to RNA Pol II elongation . 52 – 54 Also , while size and frequency are widely used parameters to describe trans - criptional bursting , these concepts are approximations that satisfyingly permit a quantitative description of the stochastic transcription process . We do not exclude that the impact of the molecular mechanisms listed here could be better captured by alternative descriptions of the transcription process . Future considerations in transcription monitoring Although clear understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying transcriptional bursting is still distant , the field appreciably evolved over the past ten years . Notably , the experi - mental techniques to monitor transcription at the single - cell level greatly improved , as well as the complexity of the analytic tools . For example , on the modeling side , new variants of the telegraph model emerged that include additional sub - states to allow a better fit of the experimental data . 27 , 37 , 38 , 84 In addition , these models were combined with data using likelihood or Bayesian learning methods for controlled inference . Yet , several aspects could still be improved to increase the quality of the data and solve incoherencies . For example , a possible source of variability between the studies mentioned above could arise from the diversity of experimental system used . Indeed , in most studies , conclusions are drawn after focusing on a limited number of genes , and the identified mechanisms may be specific to the experiments . The development of methods for higher - throughput monitoring of transcription dynamics would greatly reduce this experimental bias , and facilitate the discovery of broad mechanisms dictating bursting regulation . Secondly , several studies trigger gene expression by using exogenous stimuli or drug treatments . In such systems , the observed phenotypes may not correspond to the endogenous transcriptional behavior , where the gene stimulation often displays lower amplitudes . Recently , researchers started to analyze bursting in naturally occurring dynamic systems such as HIV latency switch , 75 the circadian clock , 16 , 36 developmental systems 49 , 50 or metabolic processes . 25 These endogenously dynamic systems may better capture the intrinsic bursting behavior of eukaryotic genes . Next , it may be possible to overcome major drawbacks present in most technical approaches by combining several monitoring systems in a single study . This strategy , which allows greater precision in the measurement and strengthens the confidence in data , was also eﬀectively followed recently to notably measure expression noise both at the mRNA and protein level 29 , 55 or obtain complementary method - specific information . 77 It is all the more pertinent that some genes display bursting at diﬀerent time - scales , influenced either by the passing of Pol II convoys or long - term promoter active states . 85 In this context , focusing on the precise monitoring of transcription during short periods ( typically with the MS2 - GFP approach ) or obtaining longer time - scale recordings yet less sensitive to signal fluctuations ( typically protein reporters ) could result in incomplete information . Also , several experimental biases tend to neglect biological processes likely influencing noise . It is notably the case of the Review Molecular BioSystems P ub li s h e d on 02 J un e 2017 .

In the future , such elements should be more system - atically included in the experimental design in order to improve the biological relevance of the new findings . Applying these new strategies should result in a boarder understanding of the diﬀerent factors shaping transcriptional bursting , refining our comprehension of transcriptional mechanisms , clarifying the regulation of specific genes , and improving our capacities in fine - tuning expression modulation .
