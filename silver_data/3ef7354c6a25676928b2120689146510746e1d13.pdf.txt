RES EAR CH Open Access Clathrin - and dynamin - dependent endocytosis limits canonical NF - κ B signaling triggered by lymphotoxin β receptor Ma ł gorzata Maksymowicz , Marta Mi ą czy ń ska and Magdalena Banach - Or ł owska * Abstract Background : Lymphotoxin β receptor ( LT β R ) is a member of tumor necrosis factor receptor ( TNFR ) superfamily which regulates the immune response . At the cellular level , upon ligand binding , the receptor activates the pro - inflammatory NF - κ B and AP - 1 pathways . Yet , the intracellular distribution of LT β R , the routes of its endocytosis and their connection to the signaling activation are not characterized . Here , we investigated the contribution of LT β R internalization to its signaling potential . Methods : Intracellular localization of LT β R in unstimulated and stimulated cells was analyzed by confocal microscopy . Endocytosis impairment was achieved through siRNA - or CRISPR / Cas9 - mediated depletion , or chemical inhibition of proteins regulating endocytic routes . The activation of LT β R - induced signaling was examined . The levels of effector proteins of the canonical and non - canonical branches of the NF - κ B pathway , and the phosphorylation of JNK , Akt , ERK1 / 2 , STAT1 and STAT3 involved in diverse signaling cascades , were measured by Western blotting . A transcriptional response to LT β R stimulation was assessed by qRT - PCR analysis . Results : We demonstrated that LT β R was predominantly present on endocytic vesicles and the Golgi apparatus . The ligand - bound pool of the receptor localized to endosomes and was trafficked towards lysosomes for degradation . Depletion of regulators of different endocytic routes ( clathrin - mediated , dynamin - dependent or clathrin - independent ) resulted in the impairment of LT β R internalization , indicating that this receptor uses multiple entry pathways . Cells deprived of clathrin and dynamins exhibited enhanced activation of canonical NF - κ B signaling represented by increased degradation of I κ B α inhibitor and elevated expression of LT β R target genes . We also demonstrated that clathrin and dynamin deficiency reduced to some extent LT β R - triggered activation of the non - canonical branch of the NF - κ B pathway . Conclusions : Our work shows that the impairment of clathrin - and dynamin - dependent internalization amplifies a cellular response to LT β R stimulation . We postulate that receptor internalization restricts responsiveness of the cell to subthreshold stimuli .

Cell Communication and Signaling ( 2020 ) 18 : 176 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1186 / s12964 - 020 - 00664 - 0 Background Lymphotoxin β receptor ( LT β R ) , a member of tumor ne - crosis factor receptor superfamily ( TNFRSF ) , is a trans - membrane cytokine receptor . It controls the development and maintenance of secondary lymphoid organs : lymph nodes [ 1 ] and Peyer ’ s patches [ 2 ] , and immune cell develop - ment [ 3 – 6 ] . LT β R is constitutively and ubiquitously expressed , with an exception of T and B lymphocytes [ 7 , 8 ] , which in turn are the source of its two ligands : lymphotoxin α 1 β 2 ( LT α 1 β 2 ) and LIGHT [ 9 , 10 ] . Ligand binding by LT β R activates signaling cascades , leading to NF - κ B - and AP - 1 - dependent transcription [ 10 – 15 ] . The best characterized in this context is NF - κ B signaling , operating via two branches : the canonical and non - canonical ones [ 11 , 12 , 15 ] . Upon stimulation , LT β R binds TNFR - associated factor ( TRAF ) adaptors , that in the canonical branch is followed by proteasomal degrad - ation of a pathway inhibitor , I κ B α . This enables RelA / p50 heterodimer release and translocation to the nu - cleus . In the non - canonical branch TRAF binding is followed by accumulation of NF - κ B - inducing kinase ( NIK ) , leading to the degradation of an inhibitory do - main of p100 . The resulting transcriptionally active p52 form , together with RelB , acts as a transcription factor ( reviewed in [ 16 ] ) . In consequence , activation of both branches induces expression of NF - κ B target genes [ 11 , 12 , 15 , 16 ] . LT β R - ligand binding also activates a signal - ing cascade which operates through AP - 1 transcription factors . Within this pathway , the action of mitogen - activated protein kinases ( MAPKs ) , including JNK and ERK1 / 2 , activates c - Jun or ATF2 , which together with other proteins ( e . g . cFos , JunB ) form AP - 1 transcription factors [ 13 , 17 , 18 ] . LT β R was also reported to regulate the activity of diverse transcription factors , such as STAT1 [ 19 ] and STAT3 [ 20 ] . Numerous studies show that a particular receptor can be endocytosed via multiple pathways [ 21 – 23 ] . There is a large number of endocytic routes , which are classically divided into clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) and clathrin - independent endocytosis ( CIE ) . In CME , cargo is internal - ized via clathrin - coated pits due to interactions with adaptor proteins . One of them is the adaptor protein 2 ( AP2 ) complex consisting of : α , β 2 , μ 2 and σ 2 subunits , among which the μ 2 subunit ( encoded by AP2M1 gene ) is essential for cargo recognition [ 24 , 25 ] . A nascent clathrin - coated vesicle is cut off from the plasma membrane ( PM ) by a large GTPase , dynamin [ 26 – 28 ] . There are three dyna - min proteins in mammalian cells : dynamin - 1 , expressed mostly in neurons , dynamin - 2 , which is ubiquitously expressed , and dynamin - 3 , expressed in neurons , testes and lungs [ 29 , 30 ] . It was shown that some cancer cell lines ex - press both dynamin - 1 and dynamin - 2 , which play comple - mentary roles in the regulation of endocytosis [ 27 , 31 – 33 ] . Dynamins can also be involved in some forms of CIE [ 34 ] . CIE is a general term for various endocytic routes , dis - tinguished based on several criteria : the dependence on dynamin , the type of coating proteins ( e . g . caveolins , flotil - lins ) or involvement of small GTPases ( e . g . Arf6 , Cdc42 , RhoA ) . One example of CIE is a caveolae - dependent path - way . It is regulated by dynamin and operates through ca - veolae , which are formed by caveolins and cavins [ 35 ] . We recently found that LT β R internalization depends on cavin - 1 [ 36 ] . Another CIE route relying on the dynamin activity is RhoA - dependent endocytosis , which is regu - lated by RhoA together with its effectors , Rho - associated kinases : ROCK1 and ROCK2 [ 37 – 39 ] . In turn , endocytosis involving clathrin - independent carriers ( CLIC ) / glycosyl - phosphotidylinositol - anchored protein ( GPI - AP ) enriched compartments ( GEEC ) , regulated by small GTPase Cdc42 , and GTPase activating protein GRAF1 , does not require dynamin [ 40 – 42 ] . Moreover , there are routes which in - volve flotillins [ 43 , 44 ] , Arf6 [ 34 , 45 , 46 ] and curvature - generating / sensing membrane protein endophilin . The lat - ter operates both in CME and in one of CIE routes termed fast endophilin mediated endocytosis ( FEME ) [ 47 ] . Endocytosis regulates receptor signaling in different ways . Firstly , internalization decreases the amounts of receptors available on the PM for binding extracellular ligands . Secondly , internalized receptors can be trans - ported via endocytic routes towards degradation or recycled back to the PM that modulates the kinetics and strength of signal transmission [ 27 , 48 – 51 ] . Finally , some receptors propagate signals from endosomes , which play a role of intracellular signaling platforms [ 52 , 53 ] . While there are many reports on tyrosine kinase receptors ( RTKs ) and G protein - coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) , showing the link between endocytosis and signaling [ 23 , 54 , 55 ] , the knowledge on such regulation for cytokine receptors is limited [ 22 ] . Most of the studies on LT β R focus on its role in development and maintenance of im - mune system [ 56 , 57 ] , as well as its contribution to the progress of different diseases [ 10 , 58 ] . In contrast , there are only a few reports on the cell biology of LT β R . In our previous research we showed that blocking intracellular trafficking led to the accumulation of ligand - free LT β R on endosomes . Depending on the top - ology of the receptor in endocytic vesicles , it strongly ac - tivated NF - κ B signaling in a ligand - independent manner ( when the receptor was localized on the outer endoso - mal membrane ) [ 59 ] or had no effect on signaling ( when the receptor was inside intraluminal vesicles of endo - somes ) [ 60 ] . Another study revealed that LT β R - driven activation of the non - canonical NF - κ B pathway required dynamin - 2 - dependent endocytosis [ 61 ] . Internalization , trafficking , intracellular distribution of LT β R , as well as the link between endocytosis and sig - naling of LT β R are still poorly described . In this study we addressed all these issues . We characterized the Maksymowicz et al . Cell Communication and Signaling ( 2020 ) 18 : 176 Page 2 of 21 cellular distribution of the receptor , identified its mul - tiple internalization routes and found clathrin - and dynamin - dependent endocytosis important for the acti - vation of canonical NF - κ B signaling .

Transferrin - Alexa - Fluor - 647 ( Thermo Fisher Scien - tific , # T23366 ) was added for 30 min at concentra - tion 25 μ g / ml during stimulation . The following chemical inhibitors were used to block endocytic routes : dynasore ( 100 μ M , 1 h pretreatment ; # HY - 15304 ) , chlorpromazine hydrochloride ( 20 μ M , 0 . 5 h pretreatment ; # HY - B0407A ) from MedChemExpress , ML141 ( 10 μ M , 1 . 5 h pretreatment ; # SML0407 ) from Sigma - Aldrich . To inhibit lysosomal degradation , cells were treated with chloroquine ( CQ , # C6628 , Sigma - Aldrich ) . The concentrations of CQ used in experiments were as follows : 100 μ M for HeLa , 64 μ M for A549 and HEK293T and 32 μ M for CCD1070Sk cells . After 16 h ( HeLa ) or 20 h ( A549 , HEK293T and CCD1070Sk ) of in - cubation with CQ or vehicle , cells were additionally stimulated or not for 4 h with Ago . All experiments were performed using cells cultured in full medium ( DMEM and MEM supplemented with 10 % FBS and 2 mM L - glutamine ) , except those employ - ing inhibitors of endocytosis and transferrin uptake , where starvation medium ( DMEM and MEM supple - mented with 2 mM L - glutamine ) was applied .

All siRNAs were used at concentration of 20 nM , ex - cept double dynamin - 1 / 2 knock - down where each siRNA was used at concentration of 15 nM . In case of double dynamin - 1 / 2 silencing , the following combina - tions of siRNAs were used : dynamin - 1 / 2 1 ( Dynamin - 1 1 & Dynamin - 2 1 ) , dynamin - 1 / 2 2 ( Dynamin - 1 2 & Dynamin - 2 1 ) , dynamin - 1 / 2 3 ( Dynamin - 1 1 & Dynamin - 2 2 ) . For these experiments non - targeting siR - NAs were combined as follows : Ctrl 1 ( 15 nM of Ctrl 1 and 15 nM of Ctrl 2 ) and Ctrl 2 ( 30 nM of Ctrl 2 ) . Immunofluorescence and image quantification Upon treatment , A549 cells grown on coverslips were transferred to ice and washed with ice - cold PBS , then fixed with 3 . 6 % paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature and kept in PBS at 4 °C to be later immunostained , as described previously [ 59 , 62 ] . To stain exclusively the ligand - bound pool of LT β R , cells stimulated with Ago were incubated without the primary LT β R antibody . Instead , only secondary anti - goat antibody was used to specifically stain Ago - LT β R complexes [ 36 ] . Images were acquired with Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope using 40× / 1 . 30 oil immersion objective and 1024 × 1024 pixel resolution , obtaining 10 images per each experimental condition . Images were imported to MotionTracking software ( http : / / motion - tracking . mpi - cbg . de ) which measures integral intensity ( reflecting the amounts of a protein on vesicular struc - tures ) and number of vesicles as well as colocalization of stained proteins [ 63 – 65 ] . Figures were assembled in Photoshop ( Adobe ) with only linear adjustments of con - trast and brightness . Western blot analysis Cells were transferred to ice and washed with ice - cold PBS , then lysed in RIPA lysis buffer ( 1 % Triton X - 100 , 0 . 5 % sodium deoxycholate , 0 . 1 % SDS , 50 mM Tris pH 7 . 4 , 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 5 mM EDTA ) in the presence of protease inhibitors ( 6 μ g / ml chymostatin , 0 . 5 μ g / ml leupeptin , 10 μ g / ml antipain , 2 μ g / ml aprotinin , 0 . 7 μ g / ml pepstatin A and 10 μ g / ml 4 - amidinophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride , Sigma - Aldrich ) and phosphatase inhibitors ( P0044 and P5726 , Sigma - Aldrich ) . Protein concentration was measured using BCA Pro - tein Assay Kit ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . Lysates of 20 – 30 μ g protein were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer for 10 min at 95 °C and then resolved on 10 – 12 % polyacryl - amide gels , followed by transfer onto nitrocellulose membrane ( GE Healthcare ) . Membranes were first blocked in 5 % milk in PBS - T or 5 % BSA in TBS - T , then incubated overnight with specific primary , and for 1 h with secondary antibodies . To detect the signal , Chemi - Doc system ( Bio - Rad ) or Odyssey infrared imaging sys - tem ( LI - COR Biosciences ) were used . Densitometry analysis of detected bands was performed with ImageJ Software [ 66 ] . Quantitative real - time PCR ( qRT - PCR ) Total RNA was isolated using High Pure RNA Isolation Kit ( Roche ) in accordance with the manufacturer ’ s protocol . cDNA synthesis was performed using M - MLV reverse transcriptase , random nonamers and oligo ( dT ) 23 from Sigma - Aldrich , according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions . The primers used for qRT - PCR are listed in Additional file 1 : Table 2 . Reactions were performed with KAPA SYBR FAST qPCR Master Mix ( 2X ) Universal Kit ( KK4618 , KapaBiosystems ) , using a 7900HT Fast Real - Time PCR System ( Applied Biosystems ) . Data analysis was performed in Data Assist v3 . 01 software ( Applied Biosystems ) . The expression of target genes was normal - ized to the level of transcripts of ACTB and B2M house - keeping genes , and presented as fold changes . Generation of AP2M1 knock - out A549 cell lines by CRISPR / Cas9 gene editing Knock - out of AP2M1 was performed in A549 cells , using CRISPR / Cas9 gene editing technology as described [ 36 , 60 ] . Two 25 - bp - long single guide RNA ( sgRNAs ) were designed using the Brunello library [ 67 ] ( sequences listed in Additional file 1 : Table 3 ) , followed by cloning into LentiCRISPR v2 vector ( Addgene # 52961 ) . Add - itionally , plasmids containing non - targeting sgRNA ( kind gift from Dr . Katarzyna Mleczko - Sanecka ) were designed as described [ 68 ] . Production of lentiviruses , infection of A549 cells , and clonal selection were performed according to the proto - col described before [ 36 , 60 ] . For each sgRNA targeting AP2M1 , one clone was selected , based on the best knock - down efficiency . For non - targeting sgRNA four clones were selected and pooled . Statistical analyses Each experiment was done in at least three repetitions . Data were analyzed in Prism 6 ( GraphPad Software ) . To check the significance of differences in fold changes vs control ( set as 1 ) , one sample t test was used . The Maksymowicz et al .

Results LT β R localizes to endosomes and Golgi apparatus In our previous studies we noticed a substantial intracellu - lar pool of LT β R which exhibits a complex distribution under basal ( unstimulated ) conditions in diverse cell lines ( HeLa , HEK293 and A549 ) [ 36 , 59 , 60 ] . More specifically , we observed large perinuclear LT β R - positive structures , in addition to vesicular staining . To identify intracellular compartments occupied by LT β R in our model A549 cell line , we performed a systematic microscopic analysis of cells stained for LT β R and different markers of endosomes ( early endosomes : EEA1 , late endosomes / lysosomes : LAMP1 , Fig . 1a ) or the Golgi apparatus ( cis - Golgi : GM130 , trans - Golgi : TGN46 , Fig . 1b ) . We investigated cells unstimulated ( 0 min ) and stimulated with agonistic anti - LT β R antibody ( Ago ) for different time periods ( 15 – 240 min ) to assess if and how the intracellular distribution of LT β R is affected by ligand binding . The quantitative analysis of microscopic images confirmed that under un - stimulated conditions LT β R localized to early and late endosomes [ 59 – 61 ] . We found that the colocalization of LT β R with EEA1 peaked at 15 – 30 min of stimulation with Ago , whereas with LAMP1 at 60 min ( Fig . 1a ) . Moreover , we noticed that the large perinuclear pool of the receptor colocalizing with Golgi markers was unaffected by admin - istration of Ago ( Fig . 1b ) . Integral intensity of LT β R vesi - cles , a parameter reflecting the amounts of the receptor present specifically in vesicular structures , decreased after 30 min of incubation with the ligand and subsequently dropped almost by half after 240 min ( Fig . 1a ) . Western blot analysis of LT β R level revealed its progressive de - crease starting from 2 h of stimulation ( Fig . 1c ) . This , to - gether with the colocalization of LT β R with the marker of late endosomes / lysosomes , suggested that ligand adminis - tration promoted lysosomal degradation of the receptor . Our hypothesis was evaluated in cells pretreated with chloroquine ( CQ ) , a compound inhibiting the activity of lysosomal enzymes by preventing acidification of endoso - mal compartments . Following the treatment , A549 , HEK293T , CCD1070Sk and HeLa cells were unable to re - duce the amounts of LT β R upon stimulation with Ago as efficiently as control untreated cells ( Fig . 1d ) . It was mani - fested with higher fold changes of LT β R level in stimu - lated vs unstimulated cells upon incubation with CQ than under normal conditions ( Table in Fig . 1 d ) . Our results show that LT β R , regardless of the stimula - tion status of the cell , is constitutively present on early and late endosomes as well as the Golgi apparatus . How - ever , ligation of the receptor modulates its intracellular distribution and leads to its degradation in lysosomes . Ligand - bound LT β R is trafficked towards lysosomes Since LT β R is constitutively present on membranes in - side the cell , the effect of stimulation on its intracellular distribution and trafficking shown above could be under - estimated . Thus , to eliminate this constitutive back - ground we performed microscopic analyses to detect specifically a ligand - bound pool of the receptor . Cells , stimulated as described above , were stained for endocy - tic markers and the receptor associated with Ago ( Fig . 2a ) , according to our previously optimized protocol [ 36 ] . Quantitative analysis of microscopic data revealed significant changes in the integral intensity and the number of LT β R - positive vesicles during stimulation , with the highest values at 30 min ( Fig . 2b ) . We also con - firmed that the localization of Ago - bound LT β R on early endosomes was the highest at 30 min of stimulation , whereas its localization on late endosomes / lysosomes peaked at 60 min ( Fig . 2b ) . Since we did not observe any staining of intracellular ligand - bound receptor at 240 min ( Fig . 2a ) , we concluded that it was degraded within lysosomes . Thus , the decrease in integral intensity of LT β R - positive vesicles showed in Fig . 1a and in receptor protein level in Fig . 1c and d , reflected the degradation of ligand - bound fraction of LT β R . Taken together , our results show that upon ligand binding LT β R is internalized and trafficked via early endosomes to late endosomes / lysosomes for the degradation . LT β R internalization depends on clathrin and dynamin We and others previously showed that both ligand - free and ligand - bound LT β R undergoes internalization [ 36 , 59 – 61 ] . Recently , we demonstrated that depletion of cavin - 1 ( regulator of caveolae formation ) only partially reduced internalization of ligand - bound receptor [ 36 ] . Thus , we concluded that another endocytic route / routes should be involved in LT β R trafficking . To identify them , we depleted cells of known regulators of different endocytic pathways using RNAi . Then , cells deprived of particular proteins were stimulated with Ago , stained for ligand - bound LT β R and EEA1 and analyzed by confocal microscopy . Having characterized the kinetics of LT β R trafficking upon ligand stimulation ( Fig . 2b ) , we mea - sured amounts of the internalized ligand - bound receptor ( integral intensity ) and the number of vesicles occupied by it upon 30 min of stimulation , when both parameters reached the maximal values ( Fig . 2b ) . First , we investigated the contribution of CME to LT β R internalization . To this end , we knocked down ex - pression of genes encoding clathrin heavy chain or dynamin - 1 and dynamin - 2 ( Fig . 3a ) , as both dynamin isoforms were expressed at relatively high levels in A549 cells ( Fig . 3b ) . Depletion of these proteins inhibited in - ternalization of transferrin ( Tf ) , a classical cargo of CME Maksymowicz et al . Cell Communication and Signaling ( 2020 ) 18 : 176 Page 5 of 21 [ 69 , 70 ] , as evidenced by ~ 80 % decrease of integral in - tensity and the number of Tf - positive vesicles , in com - parison to control cells transfected with non - targeting siRNAs ( Fig . 3c - f ) . This testified to efficient blocking of endocytic routes dependent on clathrin and dynamin . Under these conditions , the internalization of LT β R was reduced roughly by half , judging by the integral inten - sities and numbers of LT β R - positive vesicles ( Fig . 3d , f ) . However , a degree of reduction varied between cells transfected with different combinations of siRNAs tar - geting dynamins ( Fig . 3f ) . To confirm the above results , we blocked CME with alternative methods , using chemical inhibitors : chlorpro - mazine ( CPZ , CME inhibitor [ 71 ] ) and dynasore ( DYN , dynamin inhibitor [ 72 ] ) . We observed a profound inhib - ition of Tf and LT β R internalization in cells treated with these compounds ( Additional file 2 : Fig . S1a , b ) . Yet another way to block CME was to deprive cells of the clathrin adaptor AP2M1 [ 38 ] . To this end , we employed a CRISPR / Cas9 genome editing technology , but despite clonal selection , we failed to obtain cells with the complete knock - out ( Additional file 2 : Fig . S1c ) . Fig . 1 LT β R is internalized and trafficked towards degradation upon ligand binding . A549 cells were stimulated with Ago for the indicated time periods and immunostained for LT β R , EEA1 and LAMP1 ( a ) or trans - ( TGN46 ) and cis - Golgi ( GM130 ) ( b ) .

Cell Communication and Signaling ( 2020 ) 18 : 176 Page 6 of 21 Nevertheless , even partial depletion of AP2M1 reduced both , Tf and LT β R internalization , roughly by half ( Add - itional file 2 : Fig . S1d ) . This finding clearly indicated that LT β R constitutes a cargo recognized by AP2M1 , that con - firmed a previous observation of Ganeff et al . , who found the receptor co - immunoprecipitated with AP2M1 [ 61 ] . The interaction between these two proteins probably in - volves a dileucine motif ( localized at the C - terminal part of the receptor [ 61 ] ) , which was postulated to be import - ant for cargo recognition by the AP2 complex [ 73 ] . Taken together , our results indicate the involvement of clathrin - and dynamin - dependent routes in LT β R in - ternalization . Since efficient blocking of these routes did not completely prevent the internalization of LT β R , it is plausible that other parallel endocytic pathways are employed by the receptor . LT β R is internalized through CIE pathways To identify alternative or additional endocytic route / routes followed by LT β R , we used an analogical strategy to the one described above . We measured internalization of ligand - bound LT β R upon impairment of diverse routes of CIE [ 46 ] , achieved by depletion of their key regulators ( Fig . 4a , b ) . We aimed to impair : CLIC / GEEC ( regulated by Cdc42 , galectin - 3 and GRAF1 ) , RhoA - dependent route ( regulated by RhoA , ROCK1 , ROCK2 ) , Arf6 - associated endocytosis , FEME ( marked by endophilin - A2 ) , as well as those dependent on the pres - ence of flotillin - 1 and flotillin - 2 . We observed a decrease of the integral intensity and the number of LT β R - positive vesicles in cells deprived of Cdc42 , GRAF1 , RhoA , ROCK1 , ROCK2 and Arf6 , as well as , for single siRNAs , of galectin - 3 ( Fig . 4c ) . Endophilin - A2 and flotillin - 1 did not seem to be crucial for LT β R internal - ization since their knock - down ( Fig . 4a ) did not alter ei - ther the integral intensity or the number of LT β R vesicles ( Fig . 4c ) . In turn , depletion of flotillin - 2 in - creased both analyzed parameters . To further confirm that LT β R is internalized via CLIC / GEEC , we used Cdc42 inhibitor , ML141 , which inhibits GTP binding to this protein [ 74 , 75 ] . In A549 cells , we ex - amined the status of actin filaments ( as their polymerization dynamics depends on Cdc42 [ 76 ] ) , to corroborate the effi - cacy of Cdc42 inhibition by ML141 ( Fig . 4d ) . Cells treated with the compound exhibited disturbed actin filaments and reduced LT β R internalization ( Fig . 4d , e ) . Moreover , the ef - fects of Cdc42 inhibition ( Fig . 4e ) and depletion ( Fig . 4c ) on the integral intensity and the number of LT β R - positive ves - icles were comparable . Cumulatively , our results indicate that LT β R internal - ization occurs through diverse endocytic pathways , which include : CME , Cdc42 - regulated CLIC / GEEC , RhoA - dependent and Arf6 - associated routes . The NF - κ B pathway is preferentially activated by LT β R ligands in A549 cells Although LT β R was shown to trigger different signaling pathways [ 10 – 14 ] , the kinetics of their activation by Fig . 2 Ligand - bound LT β R localizes to endocytic compartments . a A549 cells were stimulated with Ago for the indicated time periods and immunostained for ligand - bound LT β R , EEA1 and LAMP1 .

To address this issue , we analyzed the status of selected pathways in A549 cells stimulated for various time periods with Ago , LT α 1 β 2 or LIGHT . We observed that despite minor dif - ferences between three ligands , in general they acted in a similar manner ( Fig . 5a , b ) . With respect to the kinetics of the NF - κ B pathway ac - tivation , the degradation of I κ B α inhibitory protein ( a hallmark of the canonical branch ) was observed at 60 min after ligand administration . In later time points we observed an increase in the level of this protein ( Fig . 5a ) , which confirmed the pathway activation , as I κ B α - Fig . 3 Ligand - bound LT β R is internalized through clathrin - mediated and dynamin - dependent endocytosis . a A549 cells were transfected with siRNAs targeting clathrin ( CHC , two oligonucleotides denoted with consecutive numbers ) and dynamin - 1 / 2 ( three combinations of oligonucleotides targeting dynamin - 1 and dynamin - 2 , see Methods ) along with non - targeting control ( Ctrl ) siRNAs ( two oligonucleotides or two combinations of oligonucleotides , see Methods ) .

Cell Communication and Signaling ( 2020 ) 18 : 176 Page 10 of 21 encoding NFKBIA gene is a known NF - κ B target [ 77 ] . The processing of p100 to transcriptionally potent p52 ( a hallmark of the non - canonical NF - κ B branch ) could be observed at 240 min of stimulation and continued for the next several hours ( Fig . 5a ) . These data confirmed observations from our previous study [ 36 ] . We also investigated the kinetics of activation of JNK - dependent AP - 1 pathway . We observed only a slight in - crease of JNK phosphorylation at Thr183 / Tyr185 ( that reflects its activation ) at 30 min of stimulation with li - gands ( Fig . 5b ) . Finally , we checked the activation of Akt and ERK1 / 2 - dependent signaling and the status of STAT1 and STAT3 transcription factors . Akt and ERK1 / 2 activities , assessed based on the levels of their phosphorylation ( Thr202 / Tr204 and Ser473 , respectively ) , were not af - fected under the examined conditions ( Additional file 2 : Fig . S2a ) . We also did not observe any significant changes in the activation of STAT1 or STAT3 measured by phosphorylation at Tyr701 and Tyr705 , respectively ( Additional file 2 : Fig . S2b ) . Together , our observations indicate that ligand binding by LT β R preferentially triggers the NF - κ B and , to a small extent , JNK - dependent AP - 1 pathways . Thus , we decided to focus on NF - κ B signaling , which seems to be the major pathway activated by LT β R in A549 cells . In parallel to biochemical analyses , we characterized the kinetics of expression of genes encoding cytokines ( CCL20 , TNF , IL6 , CXCL8 , CCL5 , CCL2 ) , cell adhesion molecules ( ICAM1 , VCAM1 ) , growth factor ( CSF2 ) and NF - κ B pathway regulators ( NFKBIA , NFKB2 , RELB ) that were previously shown to be up - regulated in response to LT β R stimulation in A549 cells [ 36 ] . We found that the expression of some genes ( CCL20 , TNF , IL6 , CXCL8 , CCL2 ) increased early , at 1 – 4 h after ligand administra - tion , while others ( CCL5 , ICAM1 , VCAM1 , CSF2 , NFKBIA , NFKB2 , RELB ) were up - regulated upon longer treatment ( Additional file 2 : Fig . S3 ) . Moreover , the ex - pression patterns in cells stimulated with different LT β R ligands were similar ( Additional file 2 : Fig . S3 ) , which confirmed the results of biochemical analyses mentioned before ( Fig . 5a ) . Based on the obtained data we selected two time periods of stimulation with Ago ( 2 and 24 h ) for further studies . Blocking clathrin - and dynamin - dependent LT β R internalization increases activation of the canonical NF - κ B pathway We previously demonstrated that certain defects in intracellular trafficking of LT β R can lead to strong ligand - independent activation of NF - κ B signaling [ 59 ] . Furthermore , in our recent study we showed that choles - terol removal from the PM restricted internalization of LT β R and led to strong activation of the canonical branch of the NF - κ B pathway in a ligand - dependent manner [ 36 ] . To gain better insights into the link be - tween intracellular trafficking and signaling , we investi - gated if internalization of LT β R via the identified endocytic routes influenced its signaling potential . For this purpose , we depleted cells of Cdc42 , clathrin , dynamin - 1 / 2 , or used relevant inhibitors : ML141 , chlor - promazine or dynasore , since under these conditions in - ternalization of ligand - bound LT β R was affected the most ( Fig . 3 , Fig . 4 and Additional file 2 : Fig . S1 ) . Fol - lowing siRNA - mediated knock - down or chemical inhib - ition of the selected proteins we evaluated the status of the NF - κ B pathway . We found that depletion of Cdc42 did not affect the level of I κ B α ( the canonical NF - κ B branch ) in unstimu - lated cells . In turn , degradation of I κ B α in response to LT β R stimulation ( represented by fold change vs un - stimulated conditions , see Table in Additional file 2 : Fig . S4a ) was either reduced or potentiated , depending on siRNA used for silencing . Thus , to verify Cdc42 effect on activation of LT β R - triggered canonical NF - κ B signal - ing , we treated cells with ML141 . Administration of the inhibitor had no effect on the levels of I κ B α under basal conditions or upon Ago stimulation ( Additional file 2 : Fig . S4b ) , denoting that the activation of the canonical NF - κ B pathway did not depend on Cdc42 . In turn , cla - thrin depletion potentiated degradation of I κ B α in re - sponse to Ago administration in A549 cells ( transfected with one of two targeting siRNAs , Fig . 6a ) . It was con - firmed in non - cancer HEK293T and non - transformed fibroblast CCD1070Sk cells ( transfected with either of targeting siRNAs , Fig . 6b and c ) , despite differences in clathrin depletion efficiency between these cell lines ( Fig . 6d ) . This , together with the fact that proteolysis of I κ B α was enhanced in Ago stimulated cells upon treatment with chlorpromazine ( Fig . 6e - g ) , suggested that CME may regulate the canonical branch of the NF - κ B path - way . Similar results were obtained in dynamin - deficient cells , in which stimulation with Ago led to stronger deg - radation of the pathway inhibitor in comparison to con - trol cells ( Fig . 7a - c ) in all tested cell lines , regardless of the efficiency of dynamin knock - down ( Fig . 3a and Fig . 7d ) . Also the treatment with dynasore led to stronger degradation of I κ B α in A549 and HEK293T cells ( Fig . 7e , f ) , although it did not seem to affect CCD1070Sk cells ( Fig . 7g ) . The basal levels of I κ B α remained un - changed in cells depleted of dynamin - 1 / 2 ( Fig . 7a - c , ex - cept one combination of siRNAs in A549 and CCD1070Sk cells ) or treated with dynasore ( Fig . 7e - g ) . All these data indicate that canonical NF - κ B signaling driven by LT β R activation depends on clathrin - and dynamin - mediated internalization , but not Cdc42 - regulated endocytosis . Maksymowicz et al . Cell Communication and Signaling ( 2020 ) 18 : 176 Page 11 of 21 Blocking clathrin - and dynamin - dependent LT β R internalization reduces activation of the non - canonical NF - κ B pathway In parallel , we evaluated how impairment of the above - mentioned endocytic routes affected the activation of non - canonical NF - κ B signaling . To this end , we analyzed the status of crucial components of the pathway in cells incubated with Ago for 24 h . We focused on the pro - cessing of p100 to p52 , presented as the normalized p52 / p100 ratio , and the levels of NIK . We noticed that the results from cells depleted of Cdc42 and those treated with Cdc42 inhibitor ( ML141 ) were not coher - ent . In Cdc42 - depleted cells the p52 / p100 ratio was higher than in controls ( 2 . 3 and 1 . 6 vs 1 . 0 and 1 . 1 ) , whereas it was lower in ML141 - treated cells ( 0 . 5 vs 1 . 0 ) ( Additional file 2 : Fig . S5a , b ) . These data did not allow us to determine a link between Cdc42 - regulated endo - cytosis and non - canonical NF - κ B signaling triggered by Fig . 6 Blocking clathrin - dependent endocytosis enhances activation of canonical NF - κ B signaling by LT β R . A549 ( a ) , HEK293T ( b , d ) and CCD1070Sk ( c , d ) cells were transfected with siRNAs targeting clathrin ( CHC ) ( two oligonucleotides ) along with control , non - targeting siRNAs ( two oligonucleotides ) or treated with chlorpromazine ( CPZ , e - g ) along with DMSO , and stimulated or not with Ago for 1 h .

In turn , clathrin depletion reduced p100 process - ing ( lower p52 / p100 ratio ) in response to LT β R stimula - tion in all tested cell lines ( Fig . 8a - c ) . Similarly , dynamin - 1 / 2 depletion or inhibition with dynasore re - duced p100 processing in response to LT β R stimulation in A549 cells ( Fig . 8d and e ) . This confirmed previous findings of Ganeff et al . about the role of dynamin in promoting non - canonical NF - κ B signaling [ 61 ] . Since the reduced p52 / p100 ratio in dynamin - depleted A549 cells might partially result from increased level of p100 observed upon dynamin knock - down ( Fig . 8d ) , we assessed the status of an upstream regulator of the non - canonical NF - κ B branch , NIK protein . We found that si - lencing of dynamin - 1 / 2 - encoding genes reduced Ago - dependent accumulation of NIK ( Fig . 8f ) , which in turn was abolished by dynasore treatment ( Fig . 8g ) . Our data provided evidence that clathrin - dependent endocytosis is important for non - canonical NF - κ B sig - naling in diverse cellular models , including carcinoma A549 , non - cancer , transformed HEK293T , and non - Fig . 7 Blocking dynamin - dependent endocytosis enhances activation of canonical NF - κ B signaling by LT β R .

We also con - firmed the previous finding about importance of dynamin - dependent internalization for the non - canonical NF - κ B pathway [ 61 ] . LT β R target gene expression is changed upon clathrin and dynamin depletion To further corroborate our observations , we examined if enhanced LT β R - dependent activation of the canonical NF - κ B pathway upon clathrin and dynamin - 1 / 2 deple - tion corresponded to changes in the transcription of LT β R target genes . We measured the levels of previously selected transcripts in A549 and HEK293T cells depleted of clathrin or dynamin - 1 / 2 and stimulated or not with Ago for 2 h ( Fig . 9 and Additional file 2 : Fig . S6 ) . We found that expression of some genes in these cells was changed even under unstimulated conditions in com - parison to controls ( Fig . 9a , c and Additional file 2 : Fig . S6a , c ) . Moreover , the effect of clathrin and dynamin - 1 / 2 knock - down on the transcription of selected genes was cell - type specific , as expected . Thus , to assess the effect of clathrin and dynamin - 1 / 2 depletion specifically on the responsiveness of cells to LT β R stimulation , we calcu - lated the fold change of expression in stimulated vs un - stimulated conditions in controls and cells deprived of clathrin or dynamin - 1 / 2 ( Fig . 9b , d and Additional file 2 : Fig . S6b , d ) . In agreement with our data presented in Additional file 2 : Fig . S3 , 2 h stimulation of control A549 cells ( transfected with non - targeting siRNAs ) with Ago led to a significant increase in the expression of early genes ( e . g . CCL20 , TNF , IL6 , CXCL8 , CCL2 ) . This in - crease varied from 1 . 7 for CCL2 up to 3 . 1 fold for Fig . 8 Clathrin and dynamin deficiency reduces activation of the non - canonical NF - κ B pathway . a - c A549 , HEK293T and CCD1070Sk cells were transfected with siRNAs targeting clathrin ( CHC ) ( two oligonucleotides ) along with control , non - targeting siRNAs ( two oligonucleotides ) and stimulated or not with Ago for 1 h . d , f A549 cells were transfected with siRNAs targeting dynamin - 1 / 2 ( three combinations of oligonucleotides targeting dynamin - 1 and dynamin - 2 , see Methods ) along with non - targeting control ( Ctrl ) siRNAs ( two combinations of oligonucleotides , see Methods ) and stimulated or not with Ago for 1 h . e , g A549 cells were treated with dynasore ( DYN ) or DMSO and stimulated or not with Ago for 1 h .

Similar in - crease was observed upon dynamin - 1 / 2 knock - down ( 1 . 6 for CCL2 , and 3 . 0 for CCL20 , Fig . 9d ) , although here we applied a combination of non - targeting siRNAs . The re - sults obtained for HEK293T cells confirmed data from Fig . 9 Depletion of clathrin and dynamin enhances expression of LT β R target genes in A549 cells . mRNA levels of NF - κ B target genes were analyzed by qRT - PCR in A549 cells transfected with siRNAs targeting clathrin ( CHC , two oligonucleotides denoted with consecutive numbers ) ( a , b ) , dynamin - 1 / 2 ( three combinations of oligonucleotides targeting dynamin - 1 and dynamin - 2 , see Methods ) ( c , d ) and with relevant non - targeting siRNAs and stimulated with Ago for 2 h .

Cell Communication and Signaling ( 2020 ) 18 : 176 Page 15 of 21 A549 cell line with minor differences regarding the set of genes affected ( Additional file 2 : Fig . S6b , d ) . Com - parison of expression fold changes ( stimulated vs un - stimulated ) between control and clathrin - or dynamin - depleted cells revealed that following the knock - down , cells were more responsive to the receptor stimulation . Although there were differences between clathrin - and dynamin - deficient cells , and between cells transfected with different siRNAs , the data clearly showed increase in expression of the majority of the examined genes that was further enhanced upon 2 h of stimulation . The most pronounced effects of endocytosis impairment in A549 cells were observed for early expressed genes , e . g . TNF and CXCL8 . We noticed 2 . 5 fold increase of TNF tran - script levels in response to stimulation in control A549 cells , whereas in dynamin - depleted cells this increase varied from 4 . 4 up to 10 . 3 fold depending on siRNA combination ( Fig . 9d ) . Although displaying some cell type - specific changes in comparison to A549 , HEK293T cells were also sensitized to stimulation with Ago upon silencing of clathrin - and dynamin - 1 / 2 - encoding genes ( Additional file 2 : Fig . S6b , d ) . We also examined the impact of clathrin and dynamin - 1 / 2 deprivation on transcription pattern upon prolonged stimulation with Ago in A549 cells . We found that 24 h after Ago administration the expression of VCAM1 and CSF2 genes was preferentially upregulated in control cells ( AvCtrl , Additional file 2 : Fig . S7 ) . In cla - thrin - and dynamin - 1 / 2 - depleted cells expression of only selected genes ( e . g . CCL20 , CCL5 , ICAM1 ) was en - hanced in comparison to controls upon 24 h stimulation with Ago ( Additional file 2 : Fig . S7b , d ) . Taken together , our results indicate that the expres - sion of LT β R target genes depends on its endocytosis . The inhibition of LT β R internalization potentiates the responsiveness of cells to stimulation of the receptor with the ligand , that is manifested at the level of effector proteins and gene expression . Discussion LT β R follows distinct endocytic routes It is commonly accepted that endocytosis can influence cellular localization , protein levels , as well as signaling potential of receptors . While many of them were shown to use multiple internalization routes [ 21 , 38 ] , the pur - pose of such variation is vague . Some receptors use dif - ferent endocytic routes for activation of specific signaling , e . g . TNFR1 - dependent NF - κ B pathway activa - tion was shown to depend on clathrin , but not on caveo - lae [ 78 ] . The latter were shown to regulate the activation of RhoA [ 79 ] and the PI3K / Akt pathway [ 80 ] triggered by the receptor stimulation . In this study we identified the routes of ligand - bound LT β R internalization and the consequences of their blocking for signaling triggered by the receptor . So far only a few studies of others and our own pointed to the role of dynamin - and cavin - 1 - dependent endocytosis for LT β R function [ 36 , 61 ] . Our data indicate that LT β R enters a cell mostly via pathways dependent on the activity of dynamins . However , their depletion did not fully abolish LT β R internalization , while it almost completely blocked uptake of canonical cargo , Tf . This fact urged us to search for alternative or additional endocytic pathways employed by the receptor . By performing systematic microscopic analysis of LT β R internalization we demonstrated that LT β R follows mul - tiple endocytic routes to enter a cell upon ligand bind - ing . They include CME , as well as several pathways of CIE : dynamin - independent CLIC / GEEC ( since Cdc42 and GRAF1 depletion partially reduced LT β R internal - ization ) , and dynamin - dependent routes involving RhoA , ROCK1 , ROCK2 , and Arf6 . In addition , and to our sur - prise , we found that silencing of flotillin - 2 caused in - creased internalization of ligand - bound LT β R . Based on a similar observation for ErbB2 , it was suggested that flotillins rather stabilize this receptor at the PM [ 81 ] , in - stead of promoting its internalization . We cannot ex - clude that the same mechanism operates in case of LT β R , however we did not examine this scenario further within this study . We postulate that cells employ distinct endocytic routes to ensure efficient internalization of LT β R . It is likely that keep - ing the receptor amounts at the PM at relatively low levels minimizes unnecessary stimulation of the receptor at the cell surface by subthreshold stimuli . It was proposed that the im - pairment of endocytic machinery found in glioma cells might lead to prolonged RTK - dependent signaling [ 82 ] . In case of LT β R , endocytosis via multiple routes could constitute a mechanism of protection against over - activation of LT β R - evoked pro - inflammatory responses , that can be detrimental if not controlled [ 83 ] . Moreover , we showed that upon bind - ing of the ligands LT β R is sent towards degradation in lyso - somes , which reduces its cellular levels . Previously , it was demonstrated that both local accumulation on the limiting membrane of endosomes [ 59 ] and overexpression [ 84 ] of LT β R activate pro - inflammatory signaling even in the ab - sence of a ligand , suggesting that a precise mechanism con - trolling endocytosis of LT β R is crucial . Signaling triggered by LT β R depends on its internalization In our recently published study we showed that the re - duction of LT β R internalization , by acute depletion of the PM cholesterol , enhances LT β R - triggered pro - inflammatory canonical NF - κ B signaling [ 36 ] . Here we show that ligand - dependent activation of the canonical NF - κ B branch is enhanced upon impairment of dynamin - dependent endocytosis ( in cells depleted of dynamin - 1 and dynamin - 2 , or treated with dynasore ) Maksymowicz et al . Cell Communication and Signaling ( 2020 ) 18 : 176 Page 16 of 21 and upon blocking of CME ( by clathrin depletion or treatment with chlorpromazine ) . This new finding sup - ported our previous observation that there is a correl - ation between receptor uptake and its signaling potential [ 36 ] . However , it is in contrast to the conclusion made by Ganeff et al . , who claimed that only the non - canonical branch of NF - κ B signaling depended on dynamin - regulated endocytosis [ 61 ] . They did not ob - serve hyper - activation of the canonical NF - κ B pathway ( judged by enhanced degradation of I κ B α inhibitor ) in their model HeLa cells , either upon dynamin depletion / inhibition , or upon clathrin deprivation . Discrepancy be - tween the present study and the one published by Ganeff et al . could be explained by the use of different cellular models and time periods of receptor stimulation selected for analyses . Enhanced expression of target genes supported our conclusion about the stronger activation of the canonical NF - κ B route in dynamin - and clathrin - deprived cells . It seems that increase in the levels of most examined tran - scripts in response to LT β R stimulation ( fold change stimulated vs unstimulated cells ) was higher in cells with impaired endocytosis in comparison to control cells ( Fig . 9 & Additional file 2 : Fig . S6 and S7 ) . We observed that the calculated fold changes correlated to some extent with the degree of the reduction of LT β R internalization . A549 cells transfected with the combination of dynamin - targeting siRNAs which limited LT β R uptake the most effectively ( dynamin - 1 / 2 2 ; Fig . 3f ) exhibited the highest responsiveness to the receptor stimulation ( Fig . 9 ) . The effect of clathrin - and dynamin - mediated endocytosis impairment on ligand - dependent gene ex - pression was observed mostly for those transcripts , which under conditions of normal endocytosis increased within first 4 h of the stimulation ( Additional file 2 : Fig . S3 & Fig . 9 ) . It may suggest that transcriptional response reflects the activation of immediately triggered signaling pathways , operating via NF - κ B or AP - 1 transcription factors . Moreover , our data show enhanced expression of selected targets upon silencing of clathrin or dyna - mins under ligand - free conditions . This confirms previ - ously reported findings concerning the stimulatory effect of clathrin depletion or dominant negative dynamin - 2 mutant on gene transcription [ 85 , 86 ] . The sensitivity of clathrin - and dynamin - depleted A549 cells to LT β R lig - and manifests itself more at the transcriptional level ( Fig . 9 & Additional file 2 : Fig . S7 ) than at the stage of NF - κ B pathway activation ( measured by degradation of pathway inhibitor I κ B α , Fig . 6a & Fig . 7a ) . As we showed that both NF - κ B and JNK - dependent AP - 1 pathways [ 87 ] are triggered in A549 cells upon ligand stimulation ( Fig . 5 ) , it is possible that the observed difference is a re - sult of an additive effect of activation of distinct signal - ing pathways . With respect to the activation of the non - canonical branch of the NF - κ B pathway , A549 cells partially reca - pitulated the results obtained in HeLa cell line by Ganeff et al . [ 61 ] . A549 cells deprived of dynamins or treated with dynasore were unable to process p100 to p52 and accumulate NIK as efficiently as it was observed in con - trols in response to ligand administration ( Fig . 8d - g ) . A more pronounced effect on NIK levels exerted by the treatment with dynasore might be explained by efficient blocking of dynamin activity by dynasore that cannot be achieved by siRNA - mediated knock - down . It is possible that the remaining dynamin molecules in siRNA - transfected cells can still sustain residual activity , that enables some accumulation of NIK . However , it could be insufficient to promote full processing of p100 to p52 . This would indicate that under normal conditions dynamin is involved in regulation of the non - canonical NF - κ B pathway at different stages : upstream and down - stream from NIK . In contrast to the previously published data [ 61 ] , our study revealed that clathrin - depleted cells exhibited impaired processing of p100 to p52 in re - sponse to stimulation with Ago ( Fig . 8a - c ) . These results indicate that CME is also important for the activation of the non - canonical NF - κ B pathway . Altogether , our study demonstrates that perturbation in clathrin - and dynamin - dependent endocytosis in - creases cell responsiveness to LT β R stimulation , that leads to the stronger activation of the canonical branch of NF - κ B signaling . We propose that under normal con - ditions a pro - inflammatory response to LT β R ligation is restricted by the receptor internalization via diverse endocytic routes , that prevents prolonged residence of the receptor at the cell surface . Impairment of clathrin - and dynamin - dependent endocytosis increases the avail - ability of the receptor for ligand binding at the PM . This in turn enhances LT β R - triggered canonical NF - κ B and JNK - dependent AP - 1 signaling together with transcrip - tion of early genes , as it was shown for EGFR - dependent Akt signaling [ 88 ] . Alternatively , clathrin and dynamin depletions might activate these pathways in a ligand - independent manner , making cells ‘ primed ’ for ligand - dependent signaling . It was recently shown that macro - phages with elevated basal level of NF - κ B were more sensitive and faster responding to infection [ 89 ] . With respect to the non - canonical NF - κ B pathway , our data support the idea proposed by Ganeff et al . [ 61 ] . Accord - ing to it , dynamin - dependent endocytosis of LT β R is crucial for activation of non - canonical branch by the in - ternalized receptor present at the surface of endosomes . We postulate , that under perturbation of endocytosis ( ei - ther clathrin - or dynamin - dependent ) reduced levels of endosomal LT β R are insufficient to fully activate non - canonical branch of the NF - κ B pathway . Thus , in cells deprived of clathrin or dynamins , enhancement of Maksymowicz et al . Cell Communication and Signaling ( 2020 ) 18 : 176 Page 17 of 21 transcriptional response to prolonged LT β R stimulation ( observed for selected targets , Additional file 2 : Fig . S7 ) most probably reflects hyper - activation of the canonical branch . Moreover , we cannot exclude that upon impair - ment of endocytosis LT β R affects other signaling path - ways ( in addition to NF - κ B or AP - 1 ) , not examined within this study , that in consequence could regulate ex - pression of specific target genes . Our data hint at existence of a complex endocytosis - related regulatory machinery of LT β R - dependent signal - ing that still is not fully understood . Recognizing the network of pathways affected by LT β R endocytosis could broaden our understanding of the receptor biology and direct us towards possible applications of the current data , e . g . in receptor - targeting therapies .
