Yellow to red coloration is often produced by carotenoid pigments . Different hypotheses have been formulated to explain the evolution of these traits as signals of individual quality . Many of these hypotheses involve the existence of a signal production cost . The carotenoids necessary for signaling can only be obtained from food . In this line , carotenoid - based signals could reveal an individual ’ s capacity to ﬁnd sufﬁcient dietary pigments . However , the ingested carotenoids are often yellow and became transformed by the organism to produce pigments of more intense color ( red ketocarotenoids ) . Biotransformation should involve oxidation reactions , although the exact mechanism is poorly known . We tested the hypothesis that carotenoid biotransformation could be costly because a certain level of oxidative stress is required to correctly perform the conversion . The carotenoid - based signals could thus reveal the efﬁciency of the owner in successfully managing this challenge . In a bird with ketocarotenoid - based ornaments ( the red - legged partridge ; Alectoris rufa ) , the availability of different carotenoids in the diet ( i . e . astaxanthin , zeaxanthin and lutein ) and oxidative stress were manipulated . The carotenoid composition was analyzed and quantiﬁed in the ornaments , blood , liver and fat . A number of oxidative stress biomarkers were also measured in the same tissues . First , we found that color and pigment levels in the ornaments depended on food levels of those carotenoids used as substrates in biotransformation . Second , we found that birds exposed to mild levels of a free radical generator ( diquat ) developed redder bills and deposited higher amounts of ketocarotenoids ( astaxanthin ) in ornaments . Moreover , the same diquat - exposed birds also showed a weaker resistance to hemolysis when their erythrocytes were exposed to free radicals , with females also enduring higher oxidative damage in plasma lipids . Thus , higher color production would be linked to higher oxidative stress , supporting the biotransformation hypothesis . The recent discovery of an avian oxygenase enzyme involved in converting yellow to red carotenoids may support our results . Nonetheless , the effect could also depend on the abundance of speciﬁc substrate carotenoids in the diet . Birds fed with proportionally higher levels of zeaxanthin showed the reddest ornaments with the highest astaxanthin concentrations . Moreover , these birds tended to show the strongest diquat - mediated effect . Therefore , in the evolution of carotenoid - based sexual signals , a biotransformation How to cite this article Garcı´a - de Blas et al .

Colored ornaments should provide some advantage when competing for a mate with same sex individuals ( intrasexual selection ) or by being more attractive to the choosing sex ( intersexual selection ; Andersson , 1994 ) . In many cases , colored traits inform competitors or potential mates about the quality of the owner . However , the trait should generate some beneﬁt for both emitter and receptor to be considered as a signal ( Hasson , 1997 ; Bradbury & Vehrenkamp , 1998 ; Maynard Smith & Harper , 2003 ) . This can occur by the transmission of information in a reliable ( non - falsiﬁable ) way ( Maynard Smith & Harper , 2003 ) . Zahavi ( 1975 ) proposed the “handicap principle , ” in which the reliability of the signal is due to its production / maintenance costs . The expression of a signal would proportionally be more costly for low - quality individuals compared to high - quality ones ( Grafen , 1990 ; also Getty , 2006 ) , the former being unable to signal or signaling in an inefﬁcient way . Carotenoids are natural pigments with immune - stimulant and antioxidant properties ( Britton , Liaaen - Jensen & Pfander , 2009 ) that are present in the integument of many vertebrate species , generating conspicuously colored traits ( e . g . Brush , 1990 ; Stradi , 1998 ; McGraw , 2006 ) . The most obvious cost of carotenoid - based signals is the increase of conspicuousness that would raise the risk of predation ( e . g . Godin & McDonough , 2003 ) . This idea was suggested as early as Darwin ( 1871 ) , regarding colorful ornaments but without citing the pigments . The second cost associated with these traits is related to the fact that carotenoids cannot be synthesized de novo by the organism , but are only obtained from food ( Britton , Liaaen - Jensen & Pfander , 2009 ; McGraw , 2006 ) . Assuming that carotenoids are relatively scarce in food , colored individuals should pay a cost in terms of energy or time spent searching for pigments , which was suggested by Endler ( 1980 ) and Endler ( 1983 ) in ﬁsh studies ( also Kodric - Brown , 1985 ; see in birds Hill , 1990 ; McGraw , 2006 ) . This hypothesis is difﬁcult to test and has garnered mixed support , at least in avian species ( reviewed in Hill ( 2006 ) ) , which is probably the taxon where carotenoid - based signaling has been studied most in - depth ( McGraw , 2006 ; Pe´rez - Rodrı´guez , 2009 ; Simons , Cohen & Verhulst , 2012 ) . Subsequently , Lozano ( 1994 ) was the ﬁrst to emphasize the physiologically speciﬁc roles of carotenoids in an evolutionary context , suggesting that investing large García - de Blas et al . ( 2016 ) , PeerJ , DOI 10 . 7717 / peerj . 2237 2 / 48 amounts of pigment in signaling could compromise the immune system . This idea seems to be well supported at least for some inﬂammatory responses ( phytohaemagglutinin skin test ) in birds ( reviewed in Simons , Cohen & Verhulst ( 2012 ) ) . Subsequently , von Schantz et al . ( 1999 ) followed a similar reasoning but regarding the antioxidant properties of the pigments , proposing that investing in coloration would challenge the individual’s capacity to combat oxidative stress . This type of stress is the result of an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species ( RONS ) by cell respiration and immune responses and the state ( levels and efﬁciency ) of the antioxidant defenses ( Halliwell & Gutteridge , 2007 ) . An evolutionary trade - off ( van Noordwijk & de Jong , 1986 ) in the investment of the carotenoid resources between self - maintenance ( antioxidant defense ) and reproduction ( sexual signaling ) could thus be established ( Møller et al . , 2000 ; Alonso - Alvarez et al . , 2008 ) . The von Schantz et al . ( 1999 ) hypothesis has gained popularity ( e . g . Blount et al . , 2003 ; Alonso - Alvarez et al . , 2004 ; Ho¨rak et al . , 2007 ) , probably because it uniﬁes the physiological components of trait expression , since the immune response is at least partially regulated by the oxidative machinery ( Halliwell & Gutteridge , 2007 ; Sorci & Faivre , 2009 ; Vallverdu´ - Coll et al . , 2015 ) . Nonetheless , the antioxidant role of those carotenoids involved in sexual signaling has been questioned . This criticism has mostly arisen from the weakness of some correlations between carotenoid blood levels and certain measures of antioxidant capacity or oxidative damage in avian species ( Costantini & Møller , 2008 ; Isaksson & Andersson , 2008 ) . However , a meta - analysis on the published literature of this taxon seems to support the carotenoid antioxidant function , although the results were not robust ( Simons , Cohen & Verhulst , 2012 ) . Importantly , the carotenoid molecules giving color to the ornaments are frequently not the same as those carotenoids obtained from the diet and circulating in the blood ( e . g . ﬁshes : Hata & Hata ( 1972 ) and Ohkubo et al . ( 1999 ) ; birds : McGraw ( 2006 ) and references therein ) . This issue may be key to understanding the cost of the signal , but many obscure points are as yet not understood . In particular , the site ( tissue ) where carotenoids are transformed and the type of biochemical processes involved in such transformations are little understood . In avian species , the liver was the ﬁrst tissue proposed as a potential biotransformation site ( Brush & Power , 1976 ; Brush , 1990 ) because it stores large amounts of carotenoids and it is the main ‘laboratory’ of the organism ( Blem , 2000 ; Britton , Liaaen - Jensen & Pfander , 2009 ) . Carotenoid biotransformation in the liver could compete with the activity of enzymes involved in detoxiﬁcation ( Blem , 2000 ; Hill & Johnson , 2012 ) . Hence , the fact that this vital organ could be involved could affect our understanding of the costs derived from color production . Carotenoid transformation in the liver was supported by studies in crossbills ( Loxia curvirostra ) , which found the pigment used for coloration in the liver and blood ( del Val et al . , 2009a ; del Val et al . , 2009b ; see also Hill & Johnson , 2012 ) . Studies in many other bird species , however , did not ﬁnd this and instead suggested that the ornament is the main transforming site ( McGraw , 2004 ; McGraw , 2009 ; Garcı´a - de Blas et al . , 2014 ) , which would perhaps be less important for survival compared to the liver . García - de Blas et al . ( 2016 ) , PeerJ , DOI 10 . 7717 / peerj . 2237 3 / 48 To understand how carotenoids are transformed we ﬁrst need to know the biochemical route followed from substrate pigments to ornamental carotenoids , including the intermediate compounds ( McGraw , 2006 ; Britton , Liaaen - Jensen & Pfander , 2009 ) . Lutein and zeaxanthin are the most abundant carotenoids in the diet and blood of birds ( McGraw , 2006 ) . Red ornaments displayed by many animal species are often the result of biotransformation of the cited yellow hydroxycarotenoids in red ketocarotenoids such as astaxanthin or canthaxanthin ( McGraw , 2006 ) . The pathway followed from hydroxy - to ketocarotenoids requires hydrogenation and oxidation reactions . The existence in vertebrates of speciﬁc enzymes ( hydroxylases and 4 - oxygenases ( i . e . ketolases ) ) was ﬁrst proposed ( McGraw , 2006 ; Hill & Johnson , 2012 ) and subsequently demonstrated in birds ( see Lopes et al . ( 2016 ) and Mundy et al . ( 2016 ) describing a candidate oxygenase ) . In this regard , Hill & Johnson ( 2012 ) and Johnson & Hill ( 2013 ) have recently suggested that the oxidative status of the organism could inﬂuence the activity of these enzymes , with the carotenoid - based signals , in some way , revealing the individual’s capacity to efﬁciently manage oxidative stress . The basic content of this idea was earlier formulated by Vo¨lker ( 1957 ) when trying to explain why wild birds often lost their color in captivity . He proposed that this phenomenon is the result of impairment in the oxidative metabolism involved in carotenoid transformations . Although this could have deep implications for understanding the proximate costs of animal signaling , the hypothesis has not been experimentally tested until now . In the present study , the red - legged partridge ( Alectoris rufa ) was used as the model species . This gallinacean shows red ornaments ( bill , eye rings , and legs ) mostly produced by astaxanthin and papilioerythrinone ketocarotenoids ( Garcı´a - de Blas et al . , 2013 ; Garcı´a - de Blas et al . , 2014 ) . We have experimentally shown that red head traits of males are used by females to adjust their reproductive investment , suggesting that these ornaments are indeed involved in sexual selection ( Alonso - Alvarez et al . , 2012 ) . Experiments have also shown a relationship between integumentary coloration ( and circulating carotenoid levels ) and individual quality in terms of immune capacity ( Pe´rez - Rodrı´guez & Vin˜uela , 2008 ; Perez - Rodriguez et al . , 2008 ; Mougeot et al . , 2009 ) . Redder birds also show a better resistance to oxidative stress when exposed to an immune challenge ( Pe´rez - Rodrı´guez , Mougeot & Alonso - Alvarez , 2010 ) . Moreover , young partridges exposed to high oxidative stress produced paler red traits and circulated lower blood carotenoid levels in adulthood ( Alonso - Alvarez & Galva´n , 2011 ) . We have also described that astaxanthin and papilioerythrinone pigments are not present in blood , liver or fat , which indicates that pigment transformation takes place at the ornament site ( Garcı´a - de Blas et al . , 2013 ; Garcı´a - de Blas et al . , 2014 ; Garcı´a - de Blas , Mateo & Alonso - Alvarez , 2015 ) . We have proposed that astaxanthin and papilioerythrinone should be derived from zeaxanthin and lutein in food , respectively ( i . e . Garcı´a - de Blas et al . , 2014 ) , on the basis of published biochemical pathways ( McGraw , 2006 ; LaFountain , Frank & Prum , 2013 ) . Lutein and zeaxanthin , in this order , are the most abundant carotenoids in the blood of this ( Garcı´a - de Blas et al . , 2013 ) and many other bird species ( McGraw , 2006 ) . As previously noted , the biotransformation of these García - de Blas et al . ( 2016 ) , PeerJ , DOI 10 . 7717 / peerj . 2237 4 / 48 compounds should involve oxidative reactions ( McGraw , 2006 ) . Dietary lutein would be transformed to papilioerythrinone after one 4 - oxidation and one dehydrogenation reactions , whereas dietary zeaxanthin would be converted into astaxanthin by two 4 - oxidations ( McGraw , 2006 ; LaFountain , Frank & Prum , 2013 ; Garcı ´ a - de Blas et al . , 2014 ) . Here , the carotenoid content of the diet of captive red - legged partridges was manipulated , subsequently exposing birds to an oxidative challenge . Our aims were ( 1 ) to reveal the metabolic pathway from dietary carotenoids to those deposited in the ornaments , ( 2 ) to verify the contribution to integument coloration of each dietary carotenoid , and ( 3 ) to determine if oxidative stress can inﬂuence color and the individual capacity to transform substrate carotenoids into those carotenoids allocated to ornaments . In this order , some birds received food supplemented with different zeaxanthin vs . lutein proportions , whereas other individuals received astaxanthin . In order to induce a higher oxidative stress , half of the birds in each treatment were also exposed to a free radical generator ( diquat ) in drinking water ( Galvan & Alonso - Alvarez , 2009 ; see also Koch & Hill , in press ) . We ﬁrst predicted that a higher proportion of zeaxanthin in the diet should increase astaxanthin levels in ornaments whereas a higher proportion of lutein should instead raise the papilioerythrinone concentration . Since astaxanthin is the most abundant pigment in ornaments ( Garcı´a - de Blas et al . , 2013 ; Garcı´a - de Blas et al . , 2014 ) , the group receiving dietary astaxanthin should a priori produce the reddest color and the highest astaxanthin concentrations in bare parts because no transformations would be required ( Negro & Garrido - Ferna´ndez , 2000 ) . If transformations depend on speciﬁc enzymes inducing oxidative reactions , we can ﬁrst predict that the oxidative challenge ( higher availability of free radicals ) could inhibit them by impairing / destabilizing the enzyme such as in the case of well - known antioxidant enzymes whose activity is decreased by high oxidative stress ( e . g . glutathione synthase ; Halliwell & Gutteridge , 2007 ) . This would lead to paler birds with lower ketocarotenoid levels in ornaments . Alternatively , if the oxidative challenge is mild , these reactions could be favored in a sort of compensatory ( hormetic ) response ( e . g . Costantini , Metcalfe & Monaghan , 2010 ) . This would lead to redder colors and higher ketocarotenoid levels in ornaments and speciﬁc transforming sites ( i . e . liver ; see above ) . We can only speculate on this mechanism as the nature of the ketolase enzymes is still poorly understood . Their activity should a priori depend on oxygen availability ( Fraser , Miura & Misawa , 1997 ; Schoefs et al . , 2001 ) . Superoxide or hydrogen peroxide generated by diquat redox cycling ( Fussell et al . , 2011 ; Koch & Hill , in press ) could perhaps provide this oxygen required for oxygenase activity and / or activate redox signaling pathways increasing enzyme transcription . In fact , superoxide and hydrogen peroxide can act as prime redox signaling molecules activating many different cell pathways ( e . g . Hurd & Murphy , 2009 ) . Nonetheless , free radicals derived from diquat redox cycling could also directly promote oxidation of dietary pigments . This last possibility should , however , imply increased ketocarotenoid levels in any body site where pigments and diquat - derived molecules interact ( the blood should be the ﬁrst site after absorption ) . García - de Blas et al . ( 2016 ) , PeerJ , DOI 10 . 7717 / peerj . 2237 5 / 48 MATERIAL AND METHODS Manipulation of carotenoid content in food In order to manipulate the carotenoid content of the diet , we collaborated with a company dedicated to producing animal pelleted feed ( INALSA ; Ciudad Real , Spain ; http : / / www . piensos - inalsa . com / contenido / perdices . htm ; INALSA - UCLM agreement signed on May 25 , 2012 ) . We preferred to manipulate carotenoid levels in food because carotenoids diluted in drinking water ( 1 ) can directly pigment head traits due to splashing ( previous observations in this and other species ) and ( 2 ) would have interfered with our oxidative stress manipulation . We supplied a free radical generator ( diquat ; see below ) in water . Carotenoids and diquat in the same solution would have reacted producing pro - oxidant carotenoid metabolites ( e . g . El - Agamey & McGarvey , 2008 ) . Alternatively , the use of two different water dispensers for each type of treatment would not have guaranteed a similar consumption of each solution . The manipulation of carotenoid levels in the pellets was made on a basal commercial diet normally used during reproduction of captive red - legged partridges , containing wheat , barley , corn and soy in different proportions ( INALSA , Zaragoza , Spain ) . This feed did not contain any additional carotenoid to those naturally present in the grain ( Panﬁli , Fratianni & Irano , 2004 ) and it was mixed with the different commercial carotenoids resulting in the ﬁnal feed . Commercial pigments used to prepare the different diets for the experiment were CROMO ORO Classic ( min . lutein 16 g / Kg and min . zeaxanthin 0 . 90 g / Kg ) , provided by DISPROQUIMA ( Barcelona , Spain ) , OPTISHARP TM ( Zeaxanthin 5 % CWS / S - TG ) , provided by DSM Nutritional Products ( Switzerland ) and CAROPHYLL (cid:1) Pink ( Astaxanthin 10 % CWS ) , provided by DSM Nutritional Products ( Madrid , Spain ) . The adequate amounts of each pigment to add to the food were calculated taking into account the quantities of total carotenoids authorized for poultry feed ( Directive 70 / 524 / EEC , Communication 2004 / C 50 / 01 ) . Manipulation of carotenoid levels in the diet should resemble natural scenarios ( Koch , Wilson & Hill , 2016 ) . However , the natural carotenoid content in the diet of wild red - legged partridges is currently unknown . We should , nonetheless , consider that body carotenoid levels of wild partridges are signiﬁcantly higher than levels in captive birds that usually receive carotenoid supplements ( Table 9S in Garcı´a - de Blas , Mateo & Alonso - Alvarez ( 2015 ) ) . This suggests that our supplements would not produce unnatural phenotypes . Moreover , no negative effect due to a hypothetical pharmacological level was detected in terms of survival , body mass , reproductive output ( egg production ) or oxidative stress levels ( Results ) . Pellets were elaborated following the habitual method of commercial feed preparation by using large - scale mills ( Pietsch , 2005 ) . This process yielded perfectly homogeneous pellets , similar in size and color to base feed , avoiding the pigmentation of the head of the birds by direct contact . Diet 1 ( Control ) was the basal diet . Diets 2 and 3 contained lutein and zeaxanthin in different proportions : Diet 2 ( called LutZea ) contained approximately 73 % lutein and 27 % zeaxanthin , and diet 3 ( ZeaLut ) was formed by 52 % lutein and 48 % zeaxanthin . Thus , diet 2 represented proportions often García - de Blas et al . ( 2016 ) , PeerJ , DOI 10 . 7717 / peerj . 2237 6 / 48 found in the natural diet of granivorous birds ( McGraw , 2006 ) , whereas diet 3 was a diet enriched for zeaxanthin . Diet 4 was supplemented with astaxanthin ( Ast ) . Carotenoid , tocopherol and retinol content of each type of pellet are shown in Table 1 . Unexpected differences in tocopherol and retinol levels among treatments were found . This was probably due to the protective antioxidant action of carotenoids on vitamins present in the basal feed during the pelleting process , which involves high pressures and temperatures ( Pietsch , 2005 ) , and to differences in the composition of supplements not detected during the formulation of each diet . Retinol and tocopherol are antioxidant vitamins involved in mutual recycling processes with carotenoids ( Mortensen , Skibsted & Truscott , 2001 ; Catoni , Peters & Schaefer , 2008 ; Surai , 2012 ) . To discard the inﬂuence of this potential bias , tocopherol and retinol levels in every analyzed tissue ( ornaments , plasma , liver and fat ) were quantiﬁed and included as covariates in all statistical models ( below ) . Experimental procedure The study was carried out at the Dehesa de Galiana experimental facilities ( Instituto de Investigacio´n en Recursos Cinege´ticos and Diputacio´n Provincial , Ciudad Real , Spain ) . The protocol was approved by the University of Castilla - La Mancha’s Committee on Ethics and Animal Experimentation ( approval number 1011 . 01 ) . It was conducted on captive - born , one - year - old red - legged partridges provided by a governmental breeding facility ( Chinchilla , Albacete , Spain ) . We used 182 adult partridges forming 91 pairs that were kept in outdoor cages ( 1 (cid:1) 0 . 5 (cid:1) 0 . 4 m , each pair ) under natural photoperiods and temperatures . No birds died during the study , but ten birds were removed from the experiment ( and statistical analyses ) due to escapes during handling ( treatment groups did not differ in these exclusions , all (cid:1) 2 , P > 0 . 12 ) . In these cases , replacement birds were incorporated to keep pairs in similar conditions , but the new birds were not included in posterior samplings . The sex of individuals was determined genetically following Grifﬁths et al . ( 1998 ) . Pairs were randomly divided into four groups that received one of the four diets . The sample size for Control , LutZea and ZeaLut groups was 23 pairs , and 22 pairs for the Ast group . Possible differences between groups in terms of food intake were checked during the experiment by weighing the pellet mass in feeders of a subsample of 10 pairs per group during one week , with no difference being detected ( repeated - measures ANOVA ; F 3 , 80 = 0 . 732 , P = 0 . 536 ) . The experiment was carried out during the reproductive period ( April – June ) , when the color expression of integuments is the greatest ( Pe´rez - Rodrı´guez , 2008 ) . On April 11 ( “day 0” ) , a blood sample and a color measurement ( below ) of each ornament ( eye ring , bill , and legs ) from each partridge were taken in order to determine pre - treatment color and blood levels of pigments and other physiological variables ( below ) . Color measurements and blood samples were again taken on May 29 ( “day 48 ; ” intermediate sample ) . A third color and blood sampling was performed at the end of the experiment ( July 2 ; “day 82” ) . One mL of blood was taken from the jugular vein , each time using heparinized syringes . Blood was centrifuged at 10 , 000 (cid:1) g for 10 min at 4 (cid:3) C to separate plasma from the cell fraction . Both were stored separately at García - de Blas et al . ( 2016 ) , PeerJ , DOI 10 . 7717 / peerj . 2237 7 / 48 - 80 (cid:3) C for later analysis . Before centrifugation , an aliquot of each blood sample was taken to calculate the hematocrit and resistance of erythrocytes against an oxidative challenge ( see below ) . On May 30 , just after the second sampling , half of each treatment group ( n = 45 pairs ) were randomly allocated to the oxidative challenge . Of them , 11 pairs were from Control , ZeaLut , and Ast groups , and 12 pairs from the LutZea treatment . These birds were treated with diquat dibromide added to drinking water . The commercial product “Reglone” ( Syngenta , Madrid ) was used ( 20 % w / v of diquat dibromide in water ) . Diquat dibromide is a redox cycler that is transformed to a free radical which , in reaction with molecular oxygen , produces superoxide and other redox products ( e . g . Sewalk , Brewer & Hoffman , 2000 ; Zeman et al . , 2005 ; Xu et al . , 2007 ) . The diquat bromide dose ( i . e . 0 . 50 mL / L Reglone in drinking water ; Reglone contains 20 % w / v of diquat dibromide in water ) was established on the basis of a pilot study and the results obtained in previous work in the same species , which reported no body mass changes but increased lipid oxidative damage in erythrocytes ( see Supporting Fig . 1 in Alonso - Alvarez & Galva´n ( 2011 ) ; see also Galvan & Alonso - Alvarez , 2009 ) . Color measurements The coloration of eye - rings and bills of red - legged partridges was assessed by using a portable spectrophotometer ( Minolta CM - 2600D , Tokyo ) . Hue values were calculated by using the formula of Saks , Mcgraw & Ho˜rak ( 2003 ) for brightness ( B ) of different colors ( i . e . hue = arctan { [ ( By - Bb ) / BT ] / [ ( Br - Bg ) / BT ] } , where yellow ( y ) is the addition of percentage reﬂectance within the 550 – 625 nm range , red ( r ) = 625 – 700 nm , blue ( b ) = 400 – 475 nm , green ( g ) = 475 – 550 nm and T is total brightness ) . BT obtained from our spectrophotometer ( 360 – 700 nm ) was added as a covariate to models testing the hue ( see Statistical Analyses ) , since the original formula includes BT in both numerator and denominator , thus canceling out its effect . Repeatabilities of triplicate spectrophotometric measurements were signiﬁcant for both traits ( r > 0 . 68 , P < 0 . 001 ) , with mean values for each sample being used . Leg color was assessed by means of digital photographs ( Nikon D - 3100 ; see also Garcı´a - de Blas et al . , 2013 ) because the probe of our spectrophotometer did not adapt well to the leg surface ( also Alonso - Alvarez & Galva´n , 2011 ) . In this case , the birds were placed in the same position under standardized indoor light conditions ( Kaiser Repro Lighting Unit ; Repro Base with lights RB260 2 (cid:1) 11 W 6 , 000 (cid:3) K ; Kaiser Fototechnik , Buchen ) Table 1 Composition of a sample of each different type of food used in the experiment .

A red color chip ( Kodak , NY , USA ) was placed close to the legs in order to control for subtle changes in environmental light , adding the hue values of the chip as a covariate to models testing leg color ( Statistical analyses ) . Pictures were analyzed by a technician blinded to the birds’ identity . The color intensity of the central area of one of the tarsi was determined in adults by recording mean red , green and blue values ( RGB system ; e . g . Alonso - Alvarez et al . , 2008 ) using Adobe Photoshop CS3 . Hue was determined after conversion of RGB values by using the Foley & Van Dam ( 1984 ) algorithm . Repeatability of picture measurements taken twice from a different sample of red - legged partridges was high ( r > 0 . 90 , P < 0 . 001 , n = 71 ; Alonso - Alvarez & Galva´n , 2011 ) . Since lower hue values obtained from spectrophotometer measures or pictures indicated higher redness , the sign of the hue variables was reversed ( multiplied by - 1 ) to simplify interpretations . The term “redness” was thus used to describe the hue inverse . Quantification of carotenoids and vitamins The analyses of carotenoids , and vitamins A and E in internal tissues ( i . e . plasma , liver , and subcutaneous fat ) and colored integuments were performed by HPLC - DAD - FLD following the methods described by Rodrı´guez - Estival et al . ( 2010 ) ; Garcı´a - de Blas et al . ( 2011 ) and Garcı´a - de Blas et al . ( 2013 ) . Carotenoid levels are total values adding the levels of esteriﬁed and free forms for each speciﬁc pigment . Standards of lutein , zeaxanthin , canthaxanthin , astaxanthin , astaxanthin monopalmitate and astaxanthin dipalmitate were purchased from CaroteNature ( Lupsingen , Switzerland ) . Retinyl acetate ( used as an internal standard ) and standards of retinol and a - tocopherol were provided by Sigma - Aldrich . Carotenoid and vitamin concentrations were expressed as nmoles per gram of tissue . Resistance to hemolysis under free radical exposure The resistance of red blood cells to hemolysis under exposure to a free radical generator was assessed . Whole blood was exposed to a thermo - controlled free radical aggression by adding 2 , 2 - azobis - ( aminodinopropane ) hydrochloride ( AAPH ) ( Rojas Wahl et al . , 1998 ) . Previous work has shown that if at least one component of the antiradical detoxiﬁcation system is impaired , the hemolysis curve shows a shift towards shorter times ( Blache & Prost , 1992 ; Girard et al . , 2005 ) . This test , therefore , provides an assessment of resistance to oxidative stress because all families of free radical scavengers present in the blood are mobilized to ﬁght off the oxidant attack ( e . g . Blache & Prost , 1992 ; Lesgards et al . , 2002 ; Girard et al . , 2005 ) . Ten microliters of the blood of adult birds were immediately diluted and mixed with 365 m L of KRL buffer ( for 50 mL : 0 . 020 g of KHCO 3 ; 0 . 0147 g of CaCl 2 2H 2 O ; 0 . 084 g of NaHCO 3 ; 0 . 4036 g of NaCl , 0 . 00746 g of KCl in 50 mL mili - Q water , adjusting pH to 7 . 4 with 3N HCl ) . The analyses were performed within 24 h following blood collection . Nonetheless , some aliquots could not be analyzed due to conservation problems , but this did not unbalance sample sizes of CAR and diquat treatments ( all (cid:1) 2 tests : P > 0 . 10 ) . Eighty microliters of KRL - diluted blood were incubated at 40 (cid:3) C with 136 m L of a 150 mM solution of AAPH . The lysis of red García - de Blas et al . ( 2016 ) , PeerJ , DOI 10 . 7717 / peerj . 2237 9 / 48 blood cells was assessed with a microplate reader device ( PowerWave XS2 , Bio - Tek Instruments Inc . , Winooski , VT ) , which measures the decrease in optical density at the wavelength of 540 nm every few minutes . Blood samples of a different bird species ( zebra ﬁnch , Taeniopygia guttata ) assessed twice were repeatable ( r = 0 . 84 , P < 0 . 001 , n = 43 ) . Units are reported as minutes . Plasma antioxidants The total antioxidant status ( TAS ) of blood plasma was analyzed to estimate the availability of circulating hydrosoluble antioxidants . Since the idea that this measure assesses all the antioxidants is questionable , the term “total” was avoided , and hence , we will only use the generic “Plasma Antioxidants” ( PLAOX ) . The procedure is based on Miller et al . ( 1993 ) modiﬁed by Cohen , Klasing & Ricklefs ( 2007 ) and Romero - Haro & Alonso - Alvarez ( 2014 ) . Repeatability calculated on other samples of red - legged partridges assessed twice was high ( r = 0 . 94 , P < 0 . 001 , n = 20 ; Galva ´ n & Alonso - Alvarez , 2009 ) . Plasma biochemistry Albumin , uric acid , triglycerides , LDL - cholesterol and total cholesterol levels in plasma were determined with commercial kits ( Biosystems SA , Barcelona , Spain ) with an automated spectrophotometer ( A25 - Autoanalyzer ; Biosystems SA , Barcelona , Spain ) . The last three parameters are components of lipoproteins that act as carotenoid carriers in blood ( McGraw & Parker , 2006 ) . They were assessed to test for differences in lipid absorption due to direct diquat effects on the gut ( see also Alonso - Alvarez & Galva´n , 2011 ) , but the diquat factor or its interaction with the CAR factor did not provide any signiﬁcant inﬂuence on their levels ( all P - values > 0 . 16 ) . Lipid peroxidation The measurement of lipid peroxidation in plasma , liver and heart was carried out following the method described in Romero - Haro & Alonso - Alvarez ( 2014 ) . Livers and hearts were previously diluted ( 1 : 10 w / v ) and were homogenized with a stock buffer ( phosphate buffer 0 . 01 M adjusted to pH 7 . 4 with HCl 37 % ) . Aliquots of 50 m L of the samples ( plasma , homogenized liver and heart samples , and standards ) were then capped and vortexed for 5 s , and were analyzed as described in Romero - Haro & Alonso - Alvarez ( 2014 ) . Zebra ﬁnch plasma samples assessed twice provided very high within - session ( r = 0 . 97 , n = 20 , P < 0 . 001 ) and between - session ( r = 0 . 98 , n = 20 , P < 0 . 001 ) repeatabilities ( Romero - Haro & Alonso - Alvarez , 2014 ) . Statistical analyses All the analyses were performed using SAS v9 . 3 software ( SAS Institute , Carry North Carolina , USA ) . The analyses are organized in two parts : ( 1 ) one testing the inﬂuence of carotenoid supplements only , and ( 2 ) the second analyzing the impact of the oxidative challenge ( diquat exposure ) and its interaction with carotenoid treatments . The treatment effects on the number of birds producing eggs were calculated from contingency tables ( (cid:1) 2 ) . These analyses were separately performed for each experimental period ( carotenoid exposure only or diquat exposure ) and sex . Sex was considered García - de Blas et al . ( 2016 ) , PeerJ , DOI 10 . 7717 / peerj . 2237 10 / 48 because some females escaped during the experiment and hence sample sizes differed between sexes ( see above ) . The variability in the number of eggs per individual was tested using a GENMOD procedure in the SAS software , including the number of eggs as a multinomial variable with cumulative logit link . To test the carotenoid treatment ( CAR hereafter ) effect on color and blood variables throughout the study ( i . e . , three different measures ) , repeated - measures mixed models ( PROC MIXED in SAS ; Littell et al . , 2006 ) were used . In these models , the sampling event ( TIME hereafter ) was included as the repeated - measures factor , whereas the identity of the individual nested into cage identity was the subject term ( REPEATED statement ; Littell et al . , 2006 ) . CAR ( four - level factor ) , TIME ( three - level factor ) and sex were always included in the models as ﬁxed effects , testing their two - and three - way interactions . Since the aim was exclusively testing the CAR effect with the highest available statistical power , these repeated - measure models did not include data from those individuals exposed to diquat ( day 82 only ) . To analyze the effect of diquat , variability at the last sampling ( day 82 ) was analyzed by generalized mixed models ( PROC MIXED in SAS ) . Here , CAR and diquat treatments and sex were tested as ﬁxed factors , testing their interactions . Color and blood levels at the precedent sampling event ( day 48 ) were tested as covariates to correct for subtle differences between groups at the start of the diquat exposure ( see section Variability after diquat exposure ) . Other different covariates were added to the models . Thus , as previously mentioned , the redness ( inverse of hue ) of the eye ring and bill was controlled for total brightness . In the case of the leg , the redness of the red chip was tested . In all the repeated - measures mixed models testing the CAR effect , the inﬂuence of plasma vitamin ( tocopherol and retinol ) levels was tested by including them as covariates . In all the mixed models testing the diquat effect , plasma vitamin levels in the last sampling event , as well as vitamin levels in every internal tissue and ornaments , were also added . In models testing plasma MDA values , plasma triglyceride levels were added to control for potential inﬂuences of lipid variability in the blood ( Romero - Haro & Alonso - Alvarez , 2014 ; Romero - Haro , Canelo & Alonso - Alvarez , 2015 ) . In models testing PLAOX , uric acid , and albumin values were simultaneously tested to control for inﬂuences of recent food intake ( Cohen , Klasing & Ricklefs , 2007 ) . To control for subtle differences in reproductive investment , the number of eggs produced at the end of each sampling interval ( “eggs” ) was also tested as a covariate in repeated models ( Table 2 ) . In models testing ﬁnal variability ( Tables 3 and 4 ) , the total number of eggs at the end of the study or the number of eggs during only the diquat experiment were tested as alternative covariates ( in different models ) . The lag time ( min ) to start hemolysis and hematocrit were added as covariates in models testing resistance to hemolysis . Finally , the identity of the bird nested into the identity of the cage and the laboratory session were included as random factors ( P - values ranging from < 0 . 001 to 0 . 476 ) . All the mixed models were explored from the saturated models . They ﬁrstly included all the covariates ( although see alternative options above ) , ﬁxed factors , and factor interactions . Alternative models were then tested by removing terms at P > 0 . 10 by García - de Blas et al . ( 2016 ) , PeerJ , DOI 10 . 7717 / peerj . 2237 11 / 48 Table 2 Mixed models testing the interaction between carotenoid treatment and time . The reported tests are the best ﬁtted models with an interaction at P < 0 . 10 , or instead , when it is removed at higher P - values by following a backward - step wise procedure ( see Methods ) .

The last best - ﬁtted model was also compared to alternatives using the Akaike Information Criteria ( AIC ) , providing similar conclusions . When tested as dependent variables , carotenoids and vitamins were transformed with mathematical functions to attain a normal distribution . All carotenoids and tocopherol levels were log - transformed , whereas vitamin A levels in the liver were transformed by a square root . In subcutaneous fat , carotenoid and retinol levels were standardized into two blocks because some sample sessions gave particularly low values . Differences are always provided as least square means ± SE from models ; that is , considering random factors and any term in the ﬁnal model . Pair - wise comparisons were done by means of LSD post hocs . The description of interactions and their ﬁgures in the main text are restricted to tests reporting P < 0 . 10 . Other models , ﬁgures and tables containing means and SD from raw data are described in Supplemental Information .

In contrast , integument coloration changed throughout the study according to carotenoid supplements . Redness decreased throughout reproduction , but the LutZea and ZeaLut groups counteracted this effect ( CAR (cid:1) time interaction ) in the eye ring and bill , although the latter trait only showed a trend toward signiﬁcance ( Table 2 ; Fig . 1 ) . In the eye ring , ZeaLut birds were redder than control and Ast partridges at the second sampling ( both P < 0 . 05 ; Fig . 1 ) . On the last day , LutZea and ZeaLut groups showed redder eye rings than the other treatments ( P < 0 . 034 ) , but did not differ between them ( P = 0 . 411 ; Fig . 1 ) . In the bill , differences arose at the last sampling , with LutZea , ZeaLut ( both P < 0 . 001 ) and control ( but P = 0 . 068 ) birds redder than Ast animals . ZeaLut and LutZea birds were also redder than controls , with the latter only a trend ( P = 0 . 017 and 0 . 064 , respectively ; LutZea vs . ZeaLut : P = 0 . 673 ; Table 2 ; Fig . S1 ) . The legs did not show a signiﬁcant interaction ( Table 2 ) , although ZeaLut birds were redder than controls at the second and last samplings ( both P < 0 . 013 ; Fig . S1 ) . In terms of plasma pigments , the carotenoid treatment interacted with time ( Table 2 ; Fig . 2 ) . Lutein levels did not differ between ZeaLut and control birds at day 48 ( P = 0 . 48 ) , but the other comparisons among groups on that day and at the last sampling were highly signiﬁcant ( all P < 0 . 001 ) , with LutZea birds showing the highest values ( Fig . 2 ) . In the case of zeaxanthin , only Ast and control birds did not differ at the last sampling ( P = 0 . 730 ) , with the other groups differing clearly ( all P - values < 0 . 001 ) . Agreeing with predictions , ZeaLut partridges showed the highest zeaxanthin values ( Fig . 2 ) . Plasma vitamins used as covariates in these models ( Table 2 ) were also tested as dependent variables . The CAR (cid:1) time interaction was not signiﬁcant for retinol but was for tocopherol ( Table 2 ; Fig . 2 ) . ZeaLut birds showed higher tocopherol values than Figure 1 Changes in eye ring coloration during the experiment depending on the carotenoid treatment .

PLAOX changed according to the supplemented carotenoid ( Table 2 ; Fig . 3 ) . On day 48 , Ast showed higher values than other groups ( all P < 0 . 012 ) , with controls reporting higher mean levels than ZeaLut ( P = 0 . 034 ) and LutZea ( but P = 0 . 098 ) birds . At the last sampling , LutZea birds increased their values approaching Ast individuals ( P = 0 . 715 ) . Ast birds again differed from the other two groups ( both P < 0 . 023 ) , with LutZea animals showing a trend toward higher values than control ( P = 0 . 052 ) and ZeaLut ( P = 0 . 080 ) birds . The interaction remained ( P = 0 . 020 ) when removing albumin and uric acid covariates ( Fig . 3 ) .

Variability after diquat exposure When testing variables at the end of the study ( i . e . after diquat exposure ) , body mass controlled for tarsus length variability was not inﬂuenced by CAR or diquat treatments or their interactions ( all P > 0 . 10 ) . The same was found for circulating LDL and total cholesterol levels ( all P > 0 . 12 ) . Ornament color and pigments In terms of redness , CAR did not clearly interact with diquat in any trait ( all P > 0 . 24 ; Table 3 ; Fig . S2 ) . Nonetheless , diquat - exposed birds showed marginally signiﬁcant redder bills among control and ZeaLut birds ( P = 0 . 051 and 0 . 084 , respectively ; Fig . S2 ) . Moreover , in the eye ring model , sex showed a trend toward a signiﬁcant interaction with diquat ( P = 0 . 069 in its last backward step ) . Males showed redder eye rings than females , but only among diquat - treated pairs ( post hoc : P = 0 . 020 ; diquat male : 0 . 770 ± 0 . 006 ; diquat female : 0 . 757 ± 0 . 006 ; control male : 0 . 762 ± 0 . 006 ; control female : 0 . 764 ± 0 . 006 ; other pairwise comparisons : P > 0 . 18 ) . In any event , in the best - ﬁtted model excluding any interaction ( i . e . Table 4 ) , the diquat treatment alone reported a signiﬁcant effect on bill redness , with diquat - treated birds showing redder bills ( Fig . 4 ) . Best - ﬁtted models for any ornament also showed a strong CAR effect ( all P - values < 0 . 001 ; Table 4 ) . Ast birds were always the palest individuals ( all P < 0 . 001 ) , whereas ZeaLut partridges were the reddest ones , followed by LutZea birds and controls ( Fig . 5 ) . Importantly , the difference in color between ZeaLut and LutZea animals was signiﬁcant in eye rings and legs ( both P < 0 . 044 ; in the bill : P = 0 . 065 ; Fig . 5 ) . Concerning pigments , neither lutein nor zeaxanthin was detected . Diquat affected astaxanthin levels in the eye ring and bill but depending on CAR ( Table 3 ; Fig . 6 ) .

( 2016 ) , PeerJ , DOI 10 . 7717 / peerj . 2237 25 / 48 effect was partially due to differences in CAR - controls of both traits ( both P < 0 . 020 ) , with diquat - treated birds showing higher astaxanthin concentrations . Nonetheless , in the eye rings ZeaLut birds showed a marginally signiﬁcant difference in the same direction ( P = 0 . 057 ) . In the same eye ring and bill models , all pair - wise comparisons between carotenoid groups ( CAR factor : both P < 0 . 001 ) were signiﬁcant ( all P < 0 . 013 ) , showing increasing astaxanthin values in the following order : Ast , control , LutZea and ZeaLut ( Fig . 6 ) . In legs , the diquat (cid:1) CAR interaction did not affect astaxanthin ( Table 3 ) . Only CAR remained in the model ( Table 4 ) , with LutZea and ZeaLut birds showing higher astaxanthin levels ( Fig . S3 ) than other groups ( all P < 0 . 025 ) , but not differing between them ( P = 0 . 162 ; also Ast vs . control : P = 0 . 248 ) . In contrast to astaxanthin , papilioerythrinone was unaffected by diquat ( any trait : P > 0 . 16 ; Table 3 ) . The best - ﬁtted model ( Table 4 ) always reported a signiﬁcant CAR inﬂuence ( all traits : P < 0 . 010 ; Fig . S4 ) . In the eye rings , LutZea and ZeaLut birds did not differ ( P = 0 . 526 ) , but other comparisons were signiﬁcant ( P < 0 . 012 ) . In the bill , all CAR groups differed ( P < 0 . 009 ) , with LutZea showing higher levels than ZeaLut , and Figure 6 Levels of astaxanthin in the eye rings and bill after diquat exposure depending on the carotenoid treatment .

In the legs , LutZea presented higher papilioerythrinone levels than other groups ( all P ’s < 0 . 017 ; differences among other groups P > 0 . 13 ; Fig . S4 ) . Tocopherol and retinol are antioxidant vitamins whose variability could indirectly inﬂuence carotenoid values ( although tested as covariates in the models ; see Methods ) . Tocopherol , but not retinol , was detected in the ornaments . In the eye ring , the diquat (cid:1) CAR interaction showed a trend toward signiﬁcance ( P = 0 . 056 ) , with diquat decreasing tocopherol values in controls only ( P = 0 . 021 ; Tables 3 and S2 for raw data ; see also Fig . 7 ) . In the same model , the CAR factor ( P = 0 . 017 ) showed that ZeaLut partridges had higher tocopherol levels than LutZea and control birds ( both P < 0 . 016 ) , but Ast birds also showed higher vitamin levels than LutZea and control animals ( both P < 0 . 039 ; other comparisons P > 0 . 75 ) . In the bill , tocopherol was also affected by diquat (cid:1) CAR ( Table 3 ; Fig . 7 ) . Diquat decreased tocopherol values in control and LutZea individuals ( both P < 0 . 05 ; Fig . 7 ) . The CAR factor ( P = 0 . 035 ) only indicated that controls had lower values than Ast and ZeaLut ( both P < 0 . 020 ) . Finally , only the CAR effect was signiﬁcant in the legs ( Tables 3 Figure 7 Levels of tocopherol in the eye rings and bill after diquat exposure depending on the carotenoid treatment . Least square means ± SE were obtained from the models ( see Methods and Table 3 ) . Open circles : Control birds ; Solid circles : Diquat - treated birds . García - de Blas et al . ( 2016 ) , PeerJ , DOI 10 . 7717 / peerj . 2237 27 / 48 and 4 ) . ZeaLut birds showed the highest tocopherol concentrations in the legs ( both P < 0 . 005 when compared to LutZea and controls ; P = 0 . 085 when compared to Ast ) . Plasma and internal tissues With regard to circulating carotenoids , lutein showed a signiﬁcant diquat (cid:1) CAR interaction ( Table 3 ) . Among CAR groups , only controls showed signiﬁcantly higher lutein levels with diquat ( P = 0 . 039 ; control : 0 . 98 ± 0 . 01 ; diquat : 1 . 02 ± 0 . 01 , log - values ; Fig . 8 ) . In the case of zeaxanthin , although the CAR (cid:1) diquat interaction was non - signiﬁcant ( P = 0 . 200 ; Table 3 ) , the post hoc comparison within the control - CAR group showed a similar diquat effect ( P = 0 . 033 ; control : 0 . 86 ± 0 . 02 ; diquat : 0 . 91 ± 0 . 02 ; Fig . 8 ) . No other pigment showed detectable levels in plasma . With regard to plasma vitamins , tocopherol was unaffected by the diquat (cid:1) CAR interaction ( Table 3 ) . Nonetheless , diquat showed a signiﬁcant effect ( Table 4 ) , with tocopherol values decreasing after the exposure ( control : 1 . 08 ± 0 . 02 ; diquat : Figure 8 Levels of lutein and zeaxanthin in plasma after diquat exposure depending on the carotenoid treatment .

( 2016 ) , PeerJ , DOI 10 . 7717 / peerj . 2237 28 / 48 1 . 03 ± 0 . 02 ) . No factor or interaction was signiﬁcant in the case of plasma retinol ( all P > 0 . 10 ; Table 4 ) . In the liver , the diquat (cid:1) CAR interaction did not affect lutein levels ( Table 3 ) . The best - ﬁtted model reported a strong signiﬁcant CAR effect ( Table 4 ) . LutZea and ZeaLut birds did not differ ( P = 0 . 103 ) and showed the highest lutein levels ( Fig . S5 ) . The other comparisons always reported P < 0 . 001 , and the Ast group showed the lowest value ( Table S3 ) . In contrast , liver zeaxanthin showed a signiﬁcant CAR (cid:1) diquat interaction ( Table 3 ) . This effect was mostly due to diquat reducing zeaxanthin levels in ZeaLut birds ( P = 0 . 028 ) , and a trend in the opposite direction among controls ( P = 0 . 064 ; Fig . 9 ) . Importantly , such as in the case of astaxanthin in ornaments , the CAR factor ( P < 0 . 001 ) reported increasing liver zeaxanthin values in the following order : Ast , control , LutZea and ZeaLut ( all comparisons : P < 0 . 040 ) . With regard to liver vitamins , tocopherol was affected by CAR (cid:1) diquat ( Table 3 ) . Among CAR groups , only control values showed a diquat effect on tocopherol , i . e . a decline Figure 9 Levels of zeaxanthin and tocopherol in the liver after diquat exposure depending on the carotenoid treatment .

( 2016 ) , PeerJ , DOI 10 . 7717 / peerj . 2237 29 / 48 ( P = 0 . 001 ; Fig . 9 ) . The CAR factor in the same model ( P < 0 . 001 ) indicated signiﬁcant differences following the order showed above for liver zeaxanthin ( all P < 0 . 003 ) , but here control and Ast birds did not differ ( P = 0 . 699 ) . In the case of liver retinol , both free and esteriﬁed retinol forms were detected , the two values being added for analyses ( i . e . vitamin A ) . This variable was unaffected by CAR (cid:1) diquat ( Table 3 ) but showed a signiﬁcant CAR effect ( Table 4 ) . LutZea and ZeaLut birds did not differ ( P = 0 . 133 ) , with Ast animals reporting the highest level , and control birds the lowest ( other P < 0 . 001 ; Fig . S5 ) .

( 2016 ) , PeerJ , DOI 10 . 7717 / peerj . 2237 30 / 48 In the subcutaneous fat , no carotenoid or vitamin was affected by CAR (cid:1) diquat ( all P values > 0 . 80 ; Table 3 ) . The best - ﬁtted models always reported a signiﬁcant CAR effect ( Table 4 ; Fig . S6 ; except for tocopherol ) . In the case of lutein , all groups differed from each other ( all P < 0 . 001 ) , except ZeaLut vs . control ( P = 0 . 915 ) . The LutZea group reported the highest lutein levels , and Ast birds the lowest . For zeaxanthin , LutZea birds tended to show higher values than controls ( P = 0 . 062 ) , with other groups signiﬁcantly differing from each other ( all P < 0 . 012 ) . ZeaLut birds presented the highest zeaxanthin values , whereas Ast again showed the lowest . Tocopherol was not affected by any factor or interaction ( all P > 0 . 10 ; Table 3 ; Fig . S7 ) . With regard to retinol , all the groups differed from each other ( CAR factor in Table 4 ) , except ZeaLut and LutZea ( P = 0 . 955 ) . Ast and control birds showed the highest and lowest values , respectively ( all P < 0 . 001 ; Fig . S6 ) . Oxidative stress biomarkers PLAOX showed a three - way CAR (cid:1) diquat (cid:1) sex interaction ( Table 3 ; Fig . 10 ) . Diquat decreased hydrosoluble antioxidant levels in LutZea males ( P = 0 . 02 ) , showing a trend in the same direction in females , but in the ZeaLut group ( P = 0 . 06 ; Fig . 10 ) . No factor or interaction remained ( all P > 0 . 18 ) when removing uric acid and albumin covariates ( though they showed P < 0 . 057 ) . In plasma MDA , CAR (cid:1) diquat was non - signiﬁcant ( P = 0 . 466 ; Table 3 ) , but diquat (cid:1) sex interacted ( Table 4 ; Fig . 10 ) . Diquat - treated females showed higher lipid peroxidation than control females ( P = 0 . 001 ; males did not differ : P = 0 . 752 ) . The interaction did not change ( P = 0 . 008 ) when removing the triglyceride covariate . The CAR group was never signiﬁcant ( P > 0 . 5 ) . In liver MDA , the three - way interaction again arose ( Table 3 ; Fig . 10 ) . Diquat increased MDA values in control females ( P = 0 . 009 ) , but decreased MDA in LutZea ( P = 0 . 014 ) and Ast ( but at P = 0 . 079 ) females . Moreover , diquat control - CAR females also tended to endure higher liver MDA values than diquat ZeaLut females ( P = 0 . 068 ) . No difference was Figure 11 Effect of the diquat treatment on the erythrocyte resistance to oxidative stress . Least square means ± SE from the models ( see Methods and Table 4 ) .

The CAR group in the model was not signiﬁcant ( P = 0 . 289 ) . No factor or interaction reported signiﬁcant terms in heart MDA ( Table 4 ; all P > 0 . 12 ) . Finally , in the case of erythrocyte resistance to oxidative stress , the CAR (cid:1) diquat interaction only showed a weak trend toward signiﬁcance ( P = 0 . 090 ; Table 3 ) , but the best - ﬁtted model reported a signiﬁcant diquat effect ( Table 4 ; Fig . 11 ) . The CAR factor was not signiﬁcant ( all P > 0 . 50 ) . DISCUSSION Our results as a whole suggest that the availability of certain carotenoids in the diet and the level of oxidative stress can coexist and interact to produce pigmentation in avian ornaments . As predicted , a higher dietary content of lutein vs . zeaxanthin ( LutZea ) led to a higher papilioerythrinone accumulation in the red ornaments , whereas the opposite ( ZeaLut ) led to a higher astaxanthin deposition . Birds fed with higher zeaxanthin and lutein proportions showed the reddest ornaments , but the ﬁrst ( ZeaLut ) showed the reddest traits ( eye rings and legs ) at the end of the study . Furthermore , the oxidative challenge produced redder bills and higher astaxanthin deposition in the bare parts of some birds , the latter depending on tocopherol levels in the same tissue . Covariation between vitamins and carotenoids The carotenoid treatments affected tocopherol levels in tissues . However , this only partially agreed with diet composition , which showed the highest vitamin values in the ZeaLut and , particularly , the Ast groups ( Table 1 ) . In legs , plasma and liver , only ZeaLut birds showed higher tocopherol levels than other groups . The lack of high tocopherol values in Ast partridges in these tissues could be explained by astaxanthin interfering with vitamin absorption ( e . g . Giraudeau et al . , 2013 ; also below ) . Nonetheless , both Ast and ZeaLut groups showed the highest tocopherol levels in the other ornaments . In the case of retinoids , Ast birds also showed the highest value in liver and fat , but ZeaLut and LutZea groups did not differ . Results also suggest that carotenoids protected vitamin E from oxidative stress . In the bill , eye rings , and liver , diquat decreased tocopherol levels , but only among birds that did not receive carotenoid supplements . This suggests that a higher carotenoid availability among CAR - treated birds buffered tocopherol consumption due to free radicals , which supports the idea of mutual recycling and protective roles between tocopherol and carotenoids ( Mortensen , Skibsted & Truscott , 2001 ; Catoni , Peters & Schaefer , 2008 ; Surai , 2012 ) . The only exception was the diquat - mediated reduction in tocopherol levels in the bill of LutZea birds . Regardless , we must consider that , among carotenoids , lutein ( i . e . the most abundant carotenoid in LutZea birds ) is the weakest antioxidant ( Britton , 1995 ; Martı´nez et al . , 2008 ; see also below ) . To discriminate carotenoid effects from the inﬂuence of vitamin variability in the diet , all the statistical models were controlled for tocopherol and retinoid levels in the tissues . The problem of collateral variation of antioxidants in a supplemented diet has mostly been ignored in experiments aiming to strictly manipulate dietary García - de Blas et al . ( 2016 ) , PeerJ , DOI 10 . 7717 / peerj . 2237 32 / 48 carotenoid levels . For instance , Stirnemann et al . ( 2009 ) , Toomey & McGraw ( 2011 ) and Toomey & McGraw ( 2012 ) have used the same beadlets including zeaxanthin and tocopherol , but vitamin levels were not considered in their analyses . The addition of other antioxidants as excipients in carotenoid supplements would protect carotenoids during storage . In the other direction , the addition of carotenoids to the pelleted food could also have protected antioxidant vitamins in the basal diet , thus disrupting the original covariation among the levels of different compounds ( Table 2 ; Catoni , Peters & Schaefer , 2008 ) . In any event , we must note that diquat effects within a particular carotenoid treatment were independent of vitamin variability in that group as both diquat and control birds should have received the same vitamin amounts . In summary , results must be carefully interpreted in the light of vitamin covariation . Metabolic pathway of dietary carotenoids We predicted that birds supplemented with astaxanthin should produce the most pigmented ornaments as biotransformation is not required . Surprisingly , dietary astaxanthin was apparently not absorbed . It was not detected in blood and other internal tissues . Moreover , astaxanthin seems to have interfered with lutein , zeaxanthin and tocopherol acquisition , as the circulating levels of these molecules declined in Ast birds . Consequently , ketocarotenoid deposition in ornaments and trait redness were reduced . Carotenoid competition during intestinal absorption and / or incorporation into the chylomicrons ( e . g . Tyssandier et al . , 2002 ; Canene - Adams & Erdman , 2009 ) can be argued considering the literature on humans ( reviewed in Furr & Clark ( 1997 ) and van den Berg ( 1999 ) ) . In birds , competitive interactions of beta - carotene vs . lutein or zeaxanthin during intestinal absorption have also been reported for poultry diets ( Wang et al . , 2010 ) . Interestingly , in the opposite direction , ﬂamingoes ( Phoenicopterus ruber ) fed with lutein or zeaxanthin were unable to absorb these two pigments , but were instead able to assimilate astaxanthin , which is used as a precursor for the main carotenoid in their feathers ( i . e . canthaxanthin ; Fox & McBeth , 1970 ; McGraw , 2006 ) . Our partridges also differ from European storks ( Ciconia ciconia ) naturally feeding on crayﬁsh ( Procambarus clarkii ) containing high astaxanthin concentrations because they showed redder skin and higher astaxanthin concentrations in blood than controls ( Negro & Garrido - Ferna´ndez , 2000 ) . Phylogenetic differences may explain this . Astaxanthin is common in waterbirds feeding on ﬁshes and aquatic invertebrates ( an important astaxanthin source ) , but not among other avian species ( McGraw , 2006 ) . The red - legged partridge is a terrestrial granivorous gallinacean , and thus , astaxanthin is probably infrequent in their natural diet . For this reason , the capacity for assimilating astaxanthin may not have evolved . Nonetheless , other granivorous ( but passerine ) birds are able to absorb canthaxanthin ( McGraw & Hill , 2001 ; Hill , 2002 ) , another carotenoid described in aquatic organisms ( McGraw , 2006 ) . On the other hand , our manipulation mostly supports the biotransformation pathway proposed for red - legged partridge carotenoids ( i . e . Garcı´a - de Blas et al . , 2014 ) ; that is , lutein acting as the main papilioerythrinone precursor , with zeaxanthin acting as the García - de Blas et al . ( 2016 ) , PeerJ , DOI 10 . 7717 / peerj . 2237 33 / 48 main astaxanthin substrate . Lutein and zeaxanthin levels rose in the blood , liver and fat according to their relative abundance in the diet . Similarly , papilioerythrinone and astaxanthin in ornaments increased in higher amounts in LutZea and ZeaLut groups , respectively . The results support previous correlative ﬁndings in the same species ( Garcı´a - de Blas , Mateo & Alonso - Alvarez , 2015 ) and demonstrate that the ketocarotenoids giving color to red - legged partridge ornaments are inﬂuenced by the availability of the most common hydroxycarotenoids in birds ( McGraw , 2006 ) . As previously mentioned , lutein and zeaxanthin are the most frequently described and abundant carotenoids in the food and blood of many bird species , as well as the most common substrates for red ketocarotenoids in ornaments , at least among non - aquatic species ( Surai et al . , 2001 ; McGraw , 2006 ) . In passerines , lutein levels always prevail over zeaxanthin levels in both blood and diet , commonly at a 70 : 30 ratio ( lutein : zeaxanthin ) or higher ( e . g . McGraw et al . , 2004 ) , which could also reﬂect the dietary content ( McGraw , 2006 ) . Our manipulation supports this for a gallinacean species . Moreover , McGraw et al . ( 2004 ) proposed that birds should prioritize zeaxanthin accumulation because this pigment would proportionally contribute more to coloring red ornaments compared to lutein . This has only been supported by correlations between the ratio of these two principal hydroxycarotenoids in the body and the ratio of pigments deposited in the ornaments ( McGraw & Gregory , 2004 ; Garcı´a - de Blas , Mateo & Alonso - Alvarez , 2015 ) . Our experimental results also conﬁrm this , and support , to some extent , the hypothesis that carotenoid - based signaling reveals an individual’s capacity to ﬁnd speciﬁc carotenoids in the environment ( Hill , 1994 ; Hill , 2002 ) . Finally , the fact that astaxanthin and papilioerythrinone were only found in bare parts validates our previous ﬁndings ( Garcı´a - de Blas , Mateo & Alonso - Alvarez , 2015 ) and again supports the idea that biotransformation can take place in situ , at the colored trait , something only explored and described in passerines ( McGraw ( 2004 ) and McGraw ( 2009 ) for eleven species ; but see del Val et al . ( 2009a ) and McGraw & Toomey ( 2010 ) for two other passerine species ) . The two recent studies describing a candidate oxygenase for carotenoid biotransformation have detected the enzyme in both the liver and feather follicles of canaries ( Serinus canaria ; Lopes et al . , 2016 ) , but only in the bare parts ( bill and legs ) of zebra ﬁnches ( Mundy et al . , 2016 ) . These differences between only two passerine species would suggest a large diversity in evolutionary constraints and strategies among species . Dietary hydroxycarotenoids contributing to color Lutein and zeaxanthin supplementation attenuated the color decline observed throughout the breeding season in red - legged partridges ( Alonso - Alvarez et al . , 2008 ) . Consistently with the highest rate of astaxanthin deposition in the ornaments , the ZeaLut treatment produced the reddest birds at the end of the study . We must note that statistical analyses testing the CAR effect only ( Table 2 ) did not include data from birds treated with diquat at the last sampling event , which reduced the sample size by half . When color was tested by controlling the diquat effect , differences between the ZeaLut and LutZea group arose ( Tables 3 and 4 ; Fig . 5 ) . The fact that ZeaLut birds were the reddest suggests that García - de Blas et al . ( 2016 ) , PeerJ , DOI 10 . 7717 / peerj . 2237 34 / 48 individuals could try to obtain the highest zeaxanthin amounts in the diet to generate ornaments with the highest astaxanthin levels ( also Garcı ´ a - de Blas , Mateo & Alonso - Alvarez , 2015 ) . This scenario may support the involvement of an allocation trade - off between signaling and self - maintenance functions ( Møller et al . , 2000 ) based on a hypothetically scarce resource ( i . e . zeaxanthin ) . On the other hand , the presence of papilioerythrinone in the same ornaments is probably due to the abundance of lutein in the diet and the contribution of papilioerythrinone to color ( Garcı ´ a - de Blas et al . , 2013 ; Garcı ´ a - de Blas et al . , 2014 ) . However , astaxanthin is the most conjugated carotenoid , and hence , the reddest ( and most abundant ) pigment in red - legged partridge ornaments . Nonetheless , it has been shown that variability in papilioerythrinone levels in the red head traits can also contribute to explaining color variation , at least in a correlational sample of these birds ( i . e . Garcı ´ a - de Blas et al . , 2013 ) . Oxidative stress and carotenoids Results support that diquat indeed increased oxidative stress in our birds , although the challenge was apparently mild because no effect on body mass or egg production was detected . Diquat generates superoxide and hydrogen peroxide radicals and has been previously used in the same dose and species , reporting effects on blood antioxidant machinery and lipid peroxidation ( Galvan & Alonso - Alvarez , 2009 ; Alonso - Alvarez & Galva´n , 2011 ) . In the present study , partridges treated with diquat showed weaker erythrocyte resistance to hemolysis when blood was exposed to another free radical source ( AAPH ) . This measure has been associated with long - term ( months or years ) survival in other bird species ( Alonso - Alvarez et al . , 2006 ; Bize et al . , 2014 ) . Moreover , diquat - treated females , but not males , showed higher levels of oxidative damage in plasma lipids . Independently of diquat treatment , females allocated lower carotenoid and tocopherol ( i . e . antioxidants ) amounts to ornaments than males ( sex factor at P < 0 . 05 in most models ) , suggesting a higher investment in other reproductive traits ( e . g . egg yolk ) . Female birds could be more sensitive to oxidative damage during reproduction due to the costs associated with antioxidant allocation to eggs ( e . g . Williams , 2005 ) . Accordingly , female red - legged partridges producing eggs with higher hatching success ( probably linked to antioxidant content ; McGraw , Adkins - Regan & Parker , 2005 ) endured higher lipid peroxidation in erythrocytes ( i . e . Alonso - Alvarez et al . , 2010 ) . Similarly , diquat - treated females , but not males , showed higher lipid peroxidation in the liver than controls , but only among birds that did not receive carotenoid supplements . In fact , LutZea and Ast females treated with diquat even showed a decline in liver MDA values compared to controls of the same group ( Fig . 10 ) . This may support the antioxidant role of xanthophylls involved in coloration , at least for females . This role has been questioned repeatedly , at least for avian species ( Hartley & Kennedy , 2004 ; Costantini & Møller , 2008 ; Isaksson & Andersson , 2008 ; but see Simons , Cohen & Verhulst , 2012 ) . Finally , results from circulating hydrosoluble antioxidants ( PLAOX ) were less consistent , showing declines in response to diquat in some carotenoid groups only , and depending on the sex ( Fig . 10 ) . Moreover , independently of diquat effects , higher García - de Blas et al . ( 2016 ) , PeerJ , DOI 10 . 7717 / peerj . 2237 35 / 48 PLAOX levels in Ast and LutZea birds of both sexes compared to controls were found ( Fig . 3 ) . In contrast , PLAOX did not increase in ZeaLut partridges . The antioxidant power of each pigment is linked to the number of conjugated double bonds : 13 , 11 and 10 for astaxanthin , zeaxanthin , and lutein , respectively ( Britton , 1995 ; Britton , Liaaen - Jensen & Pfander , 2009 ; Martı´nez et al . , 2008 ) . Therefore , an increase in PLAOX among ZeaLut birds was predictable . Nonetheless , we must consider that PLAOX mostly assesses the presence of hydro - , but not lipid - soluble antioxidants ( Miller et al . , 1996 ; Cohen , Klasing & Ricklefs , 2007 ) . Thus , a higher PLAOX may also be due to a compensatory mobilization of other antioxidants ( e . g . vitamin C ) to ﬁght off a challenge of some type ( Costantini , Metcalfe & Monaghan , 2010 ) . This view particularly agrees with the highest PLAOX values in Ast birds . These animals did not show astaxanthin in plasma and even experienced lower plasma lutein , zeaxanthin and tocopherol levels than controls ( above ) . Similarly , Ast birds did not show astaxanthin in the liver , but accumulated large amounts of vitamin A in this organ , perhaps to protect the liver from some toxic insult ( Garcı´a - de Blas , Mateo & Alonso - Alvarez , 2015 ) . Anyway , we found only one study supporting this toxic effect , in which rats fed with astaxanthin endured an impairment of the liver enzymes involved in detoxiﬁcation ( Ohno et al . , 2011 ) . In summary , if PLAOX did not exclusively reveal the antioxidant capacity of circulating carotenoids , the lack of higher PLAOX values in ZeaLut birds could merely be due to other ( hydrosoluble ) antioxidants being not mobilized . Here the conclusion is that the antioxidant role of carotenoid cannot easily be addressed by PLAOX measures only . Oxidative stress and carotenoid biotransformation Although the proximate cost of ketocarotenoid - based signaling in red - legged birds may , at least partially , involve increased foraging effort to obtain large zeaxanthin amounts ( above ) , the requirement of biotransformation to produce red traits provides another substrate for natural selection . Birds exposed to diquat generated redder bills , which contradicts the constraining impact of oxidative stress on health ( e . g . Monaghan , Metcalfe & Torres , 2009 ; Dowling & Simmons , 2009 ; Costantini , 2014 ) . The results may , instead , support some response ( perhaps hormetic ; e . g . Costantini , Metcalfe & Monaghan , 2010 ) against a mild stressor , at least in terms of color expression , although the exact mechanism can only be deducted ( see below ) . We must anyway mention that , in contrast to our results , red - legged partridges exposed to the same diquat dose and duration in another experiment , but during the ﬁrst weeks of life , produced paler red colors in adulthood ( Alonso - Alvarez & Galva´n , 2011 ) . We must nonetheless consider that adverse conditions during early periods of life are particularly damaging ( Metcalfe & Monaghan , 2001 ) . Young individuals may not have fully developed antioxidant machinery ( Metcalfe & Alonso - Alvarez , 2010 ) to properly manage such an oxidative challenge . Here , pigment levels in partridge ornaments support the color ﬁndings . Carotenoid concentrations increased under diquat exposure . Interestingly , the increase in these tissues was detected for astaxanthin , but not papilioerythrinone . García - de Blas et al . ( 2016 ) , PeerJ , DOI 10 . 7717 / peerj . 2237 36 / 48 We can provide two alternative or complementary proximate mechanisms to explain these ﬁndings . First , we may suggest that a large availability of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide ( free radicals ) derived from diquat redox cycling ( Koch & Hill , in press ) could favor those conditions required for oxygen addition to hydroxycarotenoids by the enzyme ( i . e . more than dehydrogenation ) , and hence , a higher astaxanthin production . We must here remember that astaxanthin production from its substrate requires two oxygenation reactions , whereas papilioerythrinone would require one oxygenation but also a dehydrogenation ( McGraw , 2006 ; LaFountain , Frank & Prum , 2013 ; Garcı ´ a - de Blas et al . , 2014 ) . We must also consider that the hypothesized oxygenase ( above ) should require oxygen , as well as Fe 2 + cation and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate ( NADPH ; a reducing agent ; Fraser , Miura & Misawa , 1997 ; Schoefs et al . , 2001 ) . The second possibility would be that superoxide and hydrogen peroxide levels increased by diquat could act as redox signals ( e . g . Hurd & Murphy , 2009 ) promoting oxygenase ( but not dehydrogenase ) transcription as a defensive or hormetic mechanism that would ultimately lead to carotenoid biotransformation . The two recent and simultaneously published articles describing the candidate oxygenase for converting yellow to red carotenoids in birds ( Lopes et al . , 2016 ; Mundy et al . , 2016 ) show that the enzyme ( i . e CYP2J19 ) is part of the well - known P450 cytochrome , which is involved in many detoxiﬁcation reactions . Moreover , diquat has been shown to stimulate the transcription of similar oxygenase enzymes ( i . e . heme - oxygenases ) via redox signaling ( i . e . via the Nuclear factor ( erythroid - derived 2 ) - like 2 ( Nrf2 ) ; e . g . Black et al . , 2008 ; Sun et al . , 2011 ; Wilmes et al . , 2011 ) . We may here argue that high superoxide or hydrogen peroxide radicals produced by natural processes ( e . g . exercise , ﬂying effort ; Costantini , Mirzai & Metcalfe , 2012 ; Jenni - Eiermann et al . , 2014 ) could activate a similar redox mechanism favoring oxygenase activity , which could explain why wild partridges are redder compared to captive birds whose ﬂying capacity is restrained ( Garcı´a - de Blas , Mateo & Alonso - Alvarez , 2015 ) . Biotransformation due to oxidative stress , however , seems to be higher among birds with the highest availability of the main ketocarotenoid precursor ; that is , ZeaLut birds ( see in the eye ring ; though P = 0 . 057 ; Fig . 6 ) . This again supports the importance of acquiring enough quantity of speciﬁc carotenoids with the diet in a sexual signaling context ( i . e . Hill , 1994 ; but see Hill , 2011 ) . Nevertheless , the clearest effect was found in diquat - treated birds that did not receive any carotenoid supplementation ( Fig . 6 ) . The effect in these two CAR groups would agree with bill color ﬁndings ( Fig . S2 ) , although the interaction was non - signiﬁcant . The diquat effect on non - supplemented birds could be due to better zeaxanthin availability in the blood ( Fig . 8 ) and liver ( Fig . 9 ) in this group . Higher circulating levels of zeaxanthin could be a consequence of an active mobilization from stores ( liver ) and / or better intestinal absorption , both for combating oxidative stress ( e . g . Alonso - Alvarez et al . , 2008 ; McClean et al . , 2011 ; but see Isaksson & Andersson , 2008 ) . Recent works suggest that xanthophyll absorption in the intestinal mucosa can be actively regulated by speciﬁc protein scavenger receptors such as the class B member 1 ( SR - B1 ; Hill & Johnson , 2012 ; Sato et al . , 2012 ) . How diquat may have favored such receptors can only be speculated , but we could again García - de Blas et al . ( 2016 ) , PeerJ , DOI 10 . 7717 / peerj . 2237 37 / 48 consider its potential inﬂuence on different redox signaling pathways ( above ; also e . g . Cristo ´ va˜o et al . , 2009 ; Koch & Hill , in press ) . In any event , in order to test whether higher astaxanthin levels in ornaments are due to higher zeaxanthin availability ( mobilization ) in the body ( i . e . , not to higher biotransformation rates ) , we also added plasma or liver zeaxanthin levels as covariates in models testing bill and eye ring astaxanthin concentrations . As expected , a positive link between ornament astaxanthin and plasma zeaxanthin values was observed ( also Garcı ´ a - de Blas , Mateo & Alonso - Alvarez , 2015 ) , but this did not change the CAR (cid:1) diquat interaction or post hoc tests ( always P < 0 . 05 ) . Moreover , diquat did not increase zeaxanthin values in internal tissues in the other group showing increased astaxanthin deposition in ornaments ( ZeaLut ; Fig . 8 ) . Other results may still support the availability of carotenoid precursors as a key factor favoring biotransformation . Diquat decreased tocopherol values in eye rings and bills among birds that did not receive supplemented carotenoids in food ( Fig . 7 ) . When tocopherol levels in these bare parts are not statistically controlled for as a covariate , differences in astaxanthin levels among the same control birds ( Fig . 6 ) disappear ( both traits : P > 0 . 60 ) , but in the eye rings of ZeaLut birds they become signiﬁcant ( P = 0 . 036 ) . In other words , ZeaLut birds showed the highest astaxanthin levels in eye rings when exposed to diquat . This suggests that biotransformation can be even more stimulated by oxidative stress when the level of carotenoid precursors in the diet surpasses some threshold . When this is not the case , color is not impaired but tocopherol levels are probably consumed to control the challenge . In summary , the overall results suggest that speciﬁc carotenoid precursors must be sufﬁciently available and that oxidative status must be well - adjusted in order to produce the most pigmented red ornaments . In agreement with this , redder integuments have also been observed in red - legged partridges exposed to other chemicals ( i . e . pesticides and heavy metals ) that induce oxidative stress ( Lopez - Antia et al . , 2015a ; Lopez - Antia et al . , 2015b ; Vallverdu´ - Coll et al . , 2015 ) or in zebra ﬁnches enduring experimentally reduced antioxidant ( glutathione ) levels ( Romero - Haro & Alonso - Alvarez , 2015 ) . The ﬁndings support the view that oxidative stress is not only a constraint for the expression of optimal phenotypes , but that mild levels are involved in many functions ( Jones , 2006 ; Metcalfe & Alonso - Alvarez , 2010 ; Isaksson , Sheldon & Uller , 2011 ) . Furthermore , the study supports claims from Hill & Johnson ( 2012 ) and Johnson & Hill ( 2013 ) hypothesizing that carotenoid - based traits could be signaling an individual’s efﬁciency to manage oxidative stress . The results also validate the Vo¨lker ’ s ( 1957 ) ideas suggesting that a good oxidative metabolism is necessary to biotransform carotenoids used in red coloration , which could explain why birds whose ﬂying capacity was restrained by captivity became paler . However , in contrast to the works of Hill & Johnson ( i . e . , Hill & Johnson , 2012 ; Johnson & Hill , 2013 ) , our experiment also suggests the parallel involvement of a resource allocation trade - off because the body levels of substrate carotenoids inﬂuenced coloration and even the impact of oxidative stress on biotransformation . In eye rings , under oxidative stress exposure , birds receiving the highest zeaxanthin levels in the diet were also those producing the highest amounts of the main ketocarotenoid ( astaxanthin ) . Finally , we cannot conclude this discussion without applying García - de Blas et al . ( 2016 ) , PeerJ , DOI 10 . 7717 / peerj . 2237 38 / 48 a life - history perspective . High levels of sexual signaling under high oxidative stress could constitute a sort of terminal investment , with individuals increasing their chances of reproducing when their perception of future survival becomes negative ( Velando , Drummond & Torres , 2006 ; Romero - Haro & Alonso - Alvarez , 2015 ) .
