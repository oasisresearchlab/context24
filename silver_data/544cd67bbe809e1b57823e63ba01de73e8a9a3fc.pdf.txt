Introduction Many human diseases are characterized by disorders of the vasculature . In ischemic heart disease or peripheral artery disease , insufficient blood vasculature leads to tissue ischemia . In cancer , tumor angiogenesis contributes to tumor growth and metastasis . Out of the many players in the angiogenesis field , the vascular endothelial growth factors are by far the best characterized and several VEGFs have already entered clinical use in a variety of human conditions . While many studies have addressed the role of angiogenesis and the blood vasculature in human physiol - ogy and pathology , the lymphatic vascular system has until recently attracted very little attention . The vascular endo - thelial growth factor ( VEGF ) family members VEGF , VEGF - B , placental growth factor ( PlGF ) , VEGF - C and VEGF - D bind their cognate receptors VEGFR - 1 , VEGFR - 2 and VEGFR - 3 found on the vascular endothelium . VEGF is the prime hypoxia inducible angiogenic factor . VEGF inhibition has been validated as clinical cancer therapy . Furthermore , several studies have reported beneficial effects of VEGF when used as a proangiogenic therapy in the setting of tissue ischemia . PlGF may primarily mediate arteriogenesis , the formation of collateral arteries from preexisting arterioles , and thus it has potential as a therapeutic in for example occlusive atherosclerotic disease . VEGF - C and VEGF - D are primarily lymphangiogenic factors , inducing the growth of lymphatic vessels during development as well as in the adult . Inhibition of VEGF - C and VEGF - D signal transduction may prove crucial in the inhibition of lymphatic metastasis in cancer and stimulation of this pathway may be effective in the treatment of lymphedema . 0008 - 6363 / $ - see front matter D 2004 European Society of Cardiology .

VEGF VEGF binds VEGFR - 1 and VEGFR - 2 as well as neuropilin - 1 ( Nrp - 1 ) and Nrp - 2 ; the latter are receptors for semaphorins , molecules involved in axonal guidance during neuronal development [ 1 , 2 ] . VEGF induces pro - liferation , sprouting , migration and tube formation of endothelial cells ( ECs ) [ 3 ] . VEGF is also a potent survival factor for ECs during physiological and tumor angio - genesis and it has been shown to induce the expression of antiapoptotic proteins in the ECs [ 4 , 5 ] . VEGF was originally described as a permeability factor , as it increases permeability of the endothelium through the formation of intercellular gaps , vesico - vascular organelles , vacuoles and fenestrations [ 6 ] . VEGF also causes vasodilatation through the induction of the endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( eNOS ) and the subsequent increase in nitric oxide production [ 7 , 8 ] . Although VEGF acts mostly on ECs , it has been shown to also bind VEGF receptors on hematopoietic stem cells ( HSCs ) , monocytes , osteoblasts and neurons [ 3 ] . Besides angiogenesis , VEGF induces HSC mobilization from the bone marrow , monocyte chemoattraction , osteoblast - medi - ated bone formation and neuronal protection [ 3 , 9 ] . Furthermore , VEGF stimulates inflammatory cell recruit - ment and promotes the expression of proteases implicated in pericellular matrix degradation in angiogenesis [ 10 – 12 ] . Many cytokines including platelet - derived growth factor , epidermal growth factor , basic fibroblast growth factor and transforming growth factors induce VEGF expression in cells [ 13 ] . At least six VEGF isoforms of variable amino acid number are produced through alternative splicing : VEGF 121 , VEGF 145 , VEGF 165 , VEGF 183 , VEGF 189 and VEGF 206 ( Table 1 ) [ 3 ] . VEGF 121 , VEGF 165 and VEGF 189 are the major forms secreted by most cell types [ 14 ] . After secretion , VEGF 121 may diffuse relatively freely in tissues , while approximately half of the secreted VEGF 165 binds to cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans ( HSPGs ) . VEGF 189 remains almost completely seques - tered by HSPGs in the extracellular matrix making HSPGs a reservoir of VEGF that can be mobilized via proteolysis [ 3 ] . VEGF is first expressed mainly in the anterior portion of mouse embryos and it directs the migration of VEGFR - 1 and VEGFR - 2 positive cells in embryonic tissues [ 15 ] . In general , VEGF expression is stronger at sites of active vasculogenesis and angiogenesis in embryos [ 16 ] . Homo - zygous VEGF knockout mice die at E8 - E9 from defects in blood island formation , EC development and vascular formation [ 13 ] . The levels of VEGF protein during develop - ment appear critical as mice lacking even a single VEGF allele die at E11 - E12 , displaying defects in early vascular development [ 13 ] . The different biological functions of VEGF isoforms were illustrated by studies on isoform - specific VEGF knockout mice . Mice expressing only VEGF 120 ( homologue of human VEGF 121 ) die soon after birth and those that survive succumb to ischemic cardiomy - opathy and multiorgan failure [ 17 ] . Mice expressing only VEGF 188 ( human VEGF 189 ) display impaired arteriolar development and approximately half die at birth [ 18 ] . Mice expressing only VEGF 164 ( human VEGF 165 ) are viable and healthy [ 18 ] . These studies underline the importance of VEGF 165 as the principal effector of VEGF action , with intermediate diffusion and matrix - binding properties . VEGF is strongly induced in hypoxic conditions via hypoxia inducible factor ( HIF ) regulated elements of the VEGF gene [ 19 ] . Constitutive degradation of hypoxia inducible factor ( HIF ) - 1 a is blocked in hypoxia because of the oxygen requirement of HIF prolyl hydroxylases , followed by stabilization of HIF - 1 a and its heterodime - rization with HIF - 1 h , also called the aryl hydrocarbon nuclear translocator ( ARNT ) . These complexes then bind hypoxia - responsive elements ( HREs ) in the promoters of hypoxia inducible genes and initiate transcription of a set of more than a hundred genes , including genes involved in glucose transport , glycolysis , and angiogenesis [ 19 , 20 ] . Interestingly , Bartonella henselae , the causative agent of cat - scratch fever , can induce hypoxia via an intracellular oxygen consumption mechanism , leading to VEGF induction and an angiomatous tumor [ 21 ] . Examples of other hypoxia - regulated genes include cyclooxygenase - 2 ( COX - 2 ) , MMP - 2 , VEGF and VEGFR - 1 [ 19 ] . Deletion of a HRE from the mouse VEGF gene promoter results in progressive motoneuron degeneration , presumably due to insufficient vascular perfusion of nervous tissue and Table 1 A table showing the chromosomal localization , major mRNA transcript and major protein sizes of the VEGF receptors Gene Sequence homology Chromosomal localization Splice variants Major mRNA transcript size ( kb ) Major protein size ( kDa ) VEGF 6p23 . 1 121 , 145 , 165 * , 183 * , 189 * , 206 * 3 . 7 , 4 . 5 21 VEGF - B 45 % homology with VEGF - A 11q13 167 * , 186 1 . 4 21 , 30 VEGF - C 30 % homology with VEGF - A 165 4q34 – 2 . 4 20 – 21 VEGF - D 61 % homology with VEGF - C ; 31 % with VEGF - A 165 Xp22 . 31 – 2 . 2 20 – 21 PlGF 42 % homology with VEGF - A 14q24 131 , 152 * , 219 1 . 7 , 1 . 2 38 , 30 * Denotes splice variants that bind to heparan sulfate proteoglycans ( HSPGs ) .

The skin has been widely used as a model for studying VEGF action in vivo ; for example , transgenic mice over - expressing VEGF in the skin have abundant cutaneous angiogenesis and an inflammatory skin condition resembling psoriasis [ 23 ] . Overexpression of VEGF in mouse skin also accelerates experimental tumor growth [ 24 ] . In contrast , mice with a targeted deletion of VEGF in the epidermis exhibit delayed wound healing , while chemically induced skin papillomas developed less frequently in these animals [ 25 ] . VEGF blocking monoclonal antibodies or VEGF receptor inhibition reduce the growth of experimental tumors in mice and humans [ 13 , 26 , 27 ] . In humans , VEGF is expressed in practically all solid tumors studied as well as in some hematological malignancies [ 3 ] . In fact , correlations have been found between the level of VEGF expression , disease progression and survival [ 28 ] . The effects of VEGF on the lymphatic vasculature have also been recently studied . Adenoviral overexpres - sion of the murine VEGF 164 in the skin induced formation of giant lymphatic vessels [ 29 ] , while another study employing the human VEGF 165 isoform reported only dilatation of cutaneous lymphatics ( Fig . 3A ) [ 30 ] . How - ever , VEGF did not induce lymphangiogenesis in a number of other tissue types [ 31 – 34 ] . The lymphangio - genic effects of VEGF may be linked to the recruitment of inflammatory cells , such as macrophages , which express VEGFR - 1 and secrete lymphangiogenic factors [ 35 – 37 ] . At least in midgestation mouse embryos , VEGF - C but not VEGF had the capacity to induce migration of endothelial cells committed to the lymphatic endothelial lineage [ 38 ] . 3 . Placental growth factor PlGF is predominantly expressed in the placenta , heart and lungs [ 39 ] . PlGF homodimers bind VEGFR - 1 and Nrp - 1 , while PlGF heterodimerization with VEGF may also occur . Activation of VEGFR - 1 by either PlGF or VEGF induced different gene expression profiles and phosphorylation of distinct tyrosine residues in the tyrosine kinase ( TK ) domain of VEGFR - 1 [ 40 ] , while combined administration of these factors enhanced VEGF driven angiogenesis [ 41 ] . This is probably due to the fact that PlGF / VEGF heterodimers bind VEGFR - 2 and also VEGFR - 1 / VEGFR - 2 heterodimers in vitro [ 42 ] . Of the three reported human isoforms of PlGF ( PlGF - 1 , - 2 and - 3 ) , only PlGF - 2 binds HSPGs [ 42 ] . PlGF knockout mice do not have an apparent phenotype . However , these mice recover poorly from experimental myocardial infarction and exhibit impaired collateral formation in response to hind limb ischemia [ 43 ] . Overexpression of PlGF in the skin of transgenic mice results in a hypervascular phenotype with increased inflammatory and permeability responses [ 44 , 45 ] , while local administration of PlGF with recombinant adenoviruses or as a recombinant protein induces the formation of mature , leakage - resistant vessels in a macrophage - dependent manner [ 46 – 48 ] . 4 . VEGF - B VEGF - B ( also called VEGF - related factor / VRF ) is a ligand for VEGFR - 1 and Nrp - 1 , and it can form heterodimers with VEGF ( Fig . 1 ) [ 49 ] . In humans , VEGF - B is expressed as two different isoforms , VEGF - B 167 and VEGF - B 186 [ 50 ] . VEGF - B 167 is nonglycosylated , binds HSPGs and is mostly sequestered in the extracellular matrix while VEGF - B 186 is O - glycosylated , and freely diffusible . In vivo , VEGF - B 167 is the predominant form and is abundantly expressed in brown fat , in the myocardium and skeletal muscle ( Fig . 2 ) [ 49 ] . The precise role of VEGF - B in vivo is not known . As VEGF - B is highly expressed in striated muscle , myocardium and brown fat [ 51 , 52 ] , its function may be linked to high cellular energy metabolism . Interestingly , at least in one genetic background mice deficient in VEGF - B had smaller hearts and impaired recovery after experimental myocardial infarctions suggesting that the regeneration of coronary collaterals through arteriogenesis could at least in part be dependent on VEGF - B [ 53 ] . In another genetic background , a prolonged PQ interval was observed in the electrocardio - grams of VEGF - B gene targeted mice [ 54 ] . Furthermore , one report has claimed that VEGF - B knockout mice fail to develop pulmonary hypertension in response to hypoxia [ 55 ] . Conversely , overexpression of VEGF - B in the lung protected rats from hypoxic pulmonary hypertension in a manner comparable to VEGF [ 56 ] . VEGF - B knockout mice also display reduced angiogenic responses in collagen - induced arthritis , suggesting a role for VEGF - B in inflammatory angiogenesis [ 57 ] . Correspondingly , VEGF - B may have subtle angiogenic effects , as overexpression of VEGF - B in vivo by injection of recombinant plasmids in a mouse model of hind limb ischemia induced angiogenesis [ 58 ] . 5 . VEGF - C Where VEGF - A and VEGF - B isoforms are formed through alternative splicing , different forms of VEGF - C and VEGF - D are the result of proteolytic processing . VEGF - C is produced as a precursor protein , which is activated by intracellular secretory proprotein convertases furin , PC5 and PC7 [ 59 , 60 ] . The secreted , VEGFR - 3 binding 31 / 29 kD subunits of VEGF - C are bound together by disulphide bonds , but the factor is further proteolyzed in the extracellular environment by plasmin and other proteases to generate a 21 kD non - disulfide - linked homodimeric protein with high affinity for both VEGFR - 2 and VEGFR - 3 . The mature form of VEGF - C induces mitogenesis , migration and survival of ECs [ 61 ] . During T .

The expression then decreases in most tissues , remaining high in the lymph nodes [ 63 ] . VEGF - C induces selective lymphangiogenesis without accompanying angiogenesis as demonstrated by early experiments in the chick chorioallantoic membrane assay and in transgenic mice overexpressing VEGF - C in the skin [ 64 , 65 ] . Adenoviral VEGF - C gene transduction has been shown to induce growth of functional lymphatic vessels in several different animal models ( Fig . 3C ) [ 30 , 66 ] . In vivo , VEGFR - 3 activation is sufficient to induce lymphangio - genesis whereas the increase in blood vascular perme - ability induced by VEGF - C and VEGF - D is mediated by VEGFR - 2 [ 30 , 67 ] . Mice lacking both VEGF - C alleles fail to develop lymphatic vessels and succumb to tissue edema at E15 . 5 – E17 . 5 [ 38 ] . Loss of one VEGF - C allele results in lymphedema characterized by hypoplasia of the cutaneous lymphatic vessels indicating that the VEGF - C protein concentration is critical for the development of the lymphatic vasculature [ 38 ] . However , VEGF - C is not essential for the development of blood vessels unlike its receptors VEGFR - 2 and VEGFR - 3 . Sprouting of endothe - lial cells committed to the lymphatic endothelial lineage in VEGF - C gene targeted mice could be rescued by applica - tion of recombinant VEGF - C and to a lesser degree by VEGF - D , but not with VEGF . This indicates that develop - ment of the lymphatic vessels is dependent on VEGFR - 3 and VEGF - C in a nonredundant fashion [ 38 ] . VEGF - C mRNA transcription was induced in ECs in response to proinflammatory cytokines [ 68 ] . The regulation of VEGF - C mRNA transcription by these cytokines indicates that VEGF - C could regulate lymphatic vessel function during inflammation , reflecting the role of the lymphatic vasculature in the control of immune function and leukocyte trafficking . The promoter of the VEGF - C gene has been shown to contain putative NF - n B binding sites that could mediate the activation of VEGF - C mRNA tran - scription by proinflammatory cytokines [ 69 ] . A recent report demonstrated that prostaglandin E2 mediated activa - tion of COX - 2 increased VEGF - C mRNA transcription suggesting that prostanoids could induce VEGF - C driven lymphangiogenesis [ 70 ] . Recent reports have shown that inflammatory reactions in human kidney transplants undergoing rejection are accompanied by abundant lym - phangiogenesis and that VEGFR - 3 signaling contributes to VEGF165 PIGF VEGF - B VEGF - C VEGF - D Percentage of residue substitution 40 30 20 10 0 Fig . 2 .

In a rabbit cornea model of inflammatory angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis , selec - tive depletion of macrophages blocked lymphangiogenesis demonstrating that inflammatory cells can mediate the formation of lymphatic vessels [ 37 ] . The angiogenic and lymphangiogenic responses were blocked by a VEGF inhibitor . The recruited macrophages expressed abundant amounts of VEGF - C and VEGF - D , suggesting that the lymphangiogenic effect of VEGF is indirect and most likely mediated by inflammatory cytokines that induce the expression of lymphangiogenic factors in the inflammatory infiltrate . In this regard , it is interesting to note that COX - 2 up - regulated VEGF - C and promoted lymphangiogenesis in human lung adenocarcinoma [ 70 ] . VEGF - C is also highly expressed in arthritic joint synovium in patients with rheumatoid arthritis in the absence of lymphangiogenesis per se , suggesting that the lymphangiogenic response is insufficient in this disorder or that the induced VEGF - C participates in other functions [ 72 ] . In experimental models , tumor cells overexpressing VEGF - C or VEGF - D induce peritumoral and in some cases stromal lymphangiogenesis and tumor cell invasion into lymphatic vessels [ 61 , 73 , 74 ] . Furthermore , overexpression of VEGF - C in pancreatic islet cell tumors of transgenic mice induced lymphangiogenesis and promoted lymph node metastasis [ 75 ] . Interestingly , neutralization of VEGF - C and VEGF - D in an experimental tumor model by systemic overexpression of a soluble VEGFR - 3 fused to the Fc domain of immunoglobulin g chain ( VEGFR - 3 - Ig ) inhibited lym - phangiogenesis and lymph node metastasis [ 76 , 77 ] . Peritu - moral lymphatics were recently found to originate from the preexisting lymphatic vasculature while circulating endothe - lial progenitor cells did not contribute to the process [ 78 ] . Although enlarged lymphatic vessels at the tumor edge have been reported in human cancers , functional intratumoral lymphatic vessels have not been reported [ 79 ] . Interestingly , several clinical studies of cancer patients have shown a positive correlation between VEGF - C expression and lym - phatic invasion , lymphatic metastasis and patient survival [ 80 ] . However , although breast cancers frequently metasta - size to the lymph nodes , at least one study did not detect tumor lymphangiogenesis in breast cancer [ 81 ] . Fig . 3 .

VEGF - D Like VEGF - C , the human VEGF - D is processed in its N - terminal and C - terminal ends ; the mature form binds to and activates VEGFR - 2 and VEGFR - 3 , is mitogenic for EC and angiogenic as well as lymphangiogenic in vivo [ 61 ] . Mouse VEGF - D binds only VEGFR - 3 , indicating a different role for VEGF - D in mice [ 82 ] . VEGF - D is present in most human tissues , most abundantly in the lung and skin during embryogenesis [ 83 ] . In experimental tumors VEGF - D increases lymphatic vessel growth and lymphatic metastasis [ 84 ] . VEGF - D is expressed by melanoma cells and has been proposed to have a role in tumor angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis in this tumor [ 85 ] . VEGF - D , along with VEGF - C , has recently been shown to be involved in lymphatic metastasis in experimental intrathoracic lung cancer [ 86 ] . In humans , VEGF - D has been shown to be of prognostic value for lymphatic vessel invasion and also survival in certain human cancers [ 80 ] . The fully processed form of VEGF - D is able to induce strong angiogenesis in addition to lymphangiogenesis in the rabbit hind limb muscle [ 32 , 87 ] . 7 . VEGFR - 1 VEGFR - 1 ( fms - like tyrosine kinase , Flt - 1 ) is composed of seven extracellular immunoglobulin ( Ig ) homology domains , a single transmembrane region and an intra - cellular tyrosine kinase ( TK ) domain that is interrupted by a kinase - insert domain ( Fig . 1 , Table 2 ) [ 88 ] . VEGFR - 1 binds VEGF , VEGF - B and PlGF with high affinity . VEGFR - 1 by itself transmits only weak mitogenic signals in ECs [ 3 ] , but it can heterodimerize with VEGFR - 2 forming a complex with stronger signaling properties than VEGFR - 1 or VEGFR - 2 homodimers [ 43 , 89 ] ( Table 2 ) . VEGFR - 1 is expressed in ECs as well as osteoblasts , monocytes / macrophages , pericytes , placental trophoblasts , renal mesangial cells and also in some hematopoietic stem cells [ 3 , 90 ] . VEGFR - 1 expression is up - regulated during angiogenesis and also by hypoxia , unlike that of VEGFR - 2 and VEGFR - 3 [ 91 , 92 ] . During development , VEGFR - 1 is first expressed in angioblasts and in the endothelium , although less strongly than VEGFR - 2 ; VEGFR - 1 expression subsides during later embryonic development [ 93 – 95 ] . VEGFR - 1 gene targeted mice die at E8 . 5 due to disorganization of blood vessels and overgrowth of endothelial cells [ 3 ] . Although VEGFR - 1 gene targeted mice do not survive , mice lacking only the intracellular kinase ( TK ) domain are normal except for slightly impaired angiogenesis during pathologic condi - tions [ 96 , 97 ] . Activation of the VEGFR - 1 TK domain is a requisite for monocyte migration [ 98 ] . Moreover , VEGFR - 1 mediated angiogenesis as well as arteriogenesis have been shown to be dependent on monocytes [ 47 , 48 ] , and angiogenesis during experimental tumor growth is at least partially inhibited by anti - VEGFR - 1 antibodies [ 47 ] . VEGFR - 1 signaling is also involved in the recruitment and survival of bone marrow derived progenitor cells [ 99 , 100 ] . A naturally occurring soluble form of VEGFR - 1 ( sVEGFR - 1 ) , consisting of the extracellular part of VEGFR - 1 , that is able to inhibit VEGF action has been described in humans and mice [ 3 ] . sVEGFR - 1 has recently been linked to the development of gestational toxemia and preeclampsia [ 101 ] . Women with preeclampsia have ele - vated circulating sVEGFR - 1 levels and decreased circulat - ing levels of PlGF and VEGF possibly leading to EC dysfunction in the maternal and placental vasculatures [ 102 ] . 8 . VEGFR - 2 The overall structure of VEGFR - 2 ( kinase - insert domain receptor , KDR / fetal liver kinase , Flk - 1 ) is similar to that of VEGFR - 1 ( Table 2 ) [ 103 , 104 ] . VEGFR - 2 binds VEGF , VEGF - C and VEGF - D . Although the binding affinity of VEGF towards VEGFR - 2 is lower than that for VEGFR - 1 , selective activation of VEGFR - 1 and VEGFR - 2 has shown that VEGFR - 2 is the primary receptor transmitting VEGF signals in endothelial cells [ 105 – 107 ] . The expression of VEGFR - 2 is autoregulated : VEGF , VEGF - C and VEGF - D up - regulate the expression of VEGFR - 2 [ 84 , 108 ] . In addition to the ECs , VEGFR - 2 is also expressed on neuronal cells , osteoblasts , pancreatic duct cells , retinal progenitor cells , megakaryocytes and hematopoietic stem cells [ 3 , 109 ] . During development VEGFR - 2 is expressed by the primitive endoderm , embryonic angioblasts and in the blood islands as well as in angiogenic vessels [ 93 ] . VEGFR - 2 gene targeted mice die at E8 . 5 - E9 . 5 due to lack of development of the blood islands , embryonic vasculature and hematopoietic cells [ 110 , 111 ] . VEGFR - 2 expression is down - regulated in the adult blood vascular ECs , and is again up - regulated in the endothelium of angiogenic blood vessels [ 92 ] . On the other hand , sequestration of VEGF results in down - regulation of VEGFR - 2 and in apoptotic death of some capillary endothelial cells in vivo [ 112 ] . Moreover , VEGFR - 2 may be associated with integrin - dependent migration of ECs , as it forms a complex with integrin a V h 3 upon binding VEGF [ 113 , 114 ] .

VEGFR - 3 VEGFR - 3 ( fms - like tyrosine kinase 4 , Flt4 ) has only six Ig - homology domains as the fifth Ig - homology domain is proteolytically cleaved soon after biosynthesis and the resulting polypeptide chains remain linked via a disulfide bond ( Table 2 ) [ 116 , 117 ] . In humans , alternative splicing of the VEGFR - 3 gene generates two isoforms of VEGFR - 3 that differ in their C - termini [ 118 ] . VEGFR - 3 binds VEGF - C and VEGF - D [ 119 , 120 ] . VEGFR - 3 is present on all endothelia during development but in the adult it becomes restricted to lymphatic ECs and certain fenes - trated blood vascular ECs [ 121 , 122 ] . VEGFR - 3 is up - regulated on blood vascular ECs in pathologic conditions such as in vascular tumors and in the periphery of solid tumors [ 92 , 123 ] . Interestingly , EC contact with SMCs has been shown to down - regulate VEGFR - 3 in ECs [ 124 ] , suggesting that VEGFR - 3 signaling is important in nascent blood vessels , and it becomes redundant as the vessels mature . Indeed , VEGFR - 3 gene targeted mice exhibit a dramatic blood vascular phenotype , with embryonic lethal - ity at E9 . 5 from defective remodeling of the primary vascular plexus and disturbed hematopoiesis [ 125 , 126 ] . Transgenic mice overexpressing a soluble VEGFR - 3 - Ig fusion protein in the skin lack dermal lymphatic vessels and have hypoplastic deeper lymphatic vessels , although the phenotype is less pronounced as the mice age [ 127 ] . Missense mutations in VEGFR - 3 have been linked to hereditary lymphedema in humans and also to a similar condition in a mouse model of lymphedema [ 128 – 130 ] . More recently , VEGFR - 3 has also been shown to modulate adaptive immunity in an experimental model of corneal transplantation [ 131 ] . 10 . Neuropilins The neuropilins , Nrp - 1 and Nrp - 2 , have roles in immunology and neuronal development but they are also involved in angiogenesis [ 132 , 133 ] . Neuropilins bind class 3 semaphorins , which are secreted molecules that mediate repulsive signals during neuronal axon guidance [ 1 , 2 , 134 ] . Nrp - 1 also binds VEGF , VEGF - B and PlGF while Nrp - 2 binds VEGF , VEGF - C and PlGF [ 132 ] . Nrp - 1 acts as a co - receptor enhancing VEGF - VEGFR - 2 interactions , forming complexes with VEGFR - 1 and augmenting tumor angiogenesis in vivo [ 135 ] . Overexpression of Nrp - 1 in chimeric mice leads to excessive formation of capillaries and blood vessels and hemorrhages in addition to cardiac malformations [ 136 ] . In chick embryos , endothelial Nrp - 1 expression is mostly restricted to arteries , whereas Nrp - 2 primarily marks veins , indicating a role in mediating the arterial / venous identity of ECs [ 137 ] . Nrp - 2 is expressed also on lymphatic ECs , and mutated Nrp - 2 induces abnormalities in the formation of small lymphatic vessels and lymphatic capillaries in mice [ 138 ] . Nrp - 1 gene targeted mice die at E13 from vascular defects such as insufficient development of yolk sac vascular networks , deficient neural vascularization and transposition of large vessels [ 139 , 140 ] . It is thought that Nrp - 1 is required for cardiovascular development because it regulates VEGF 165 levels [ 139 ] . While Nrp - 2 gene targeted mice have normal blood vasculature , the compound Nrp - 1 / Nrp - 2 knockout mouse has a phenotype resembling that of the VEGF and VEGFR - 2 gene targeted mice [ 141 ] . 11 . Disorders of the vascular system linked to the VEGFs 11 . 1 . Therapeutic angiogenesis / arteriogenesis in ischemic heart disease and peripheral vascular disease Angiogenic growth factors may be useful for attempts to increase collateral vessel formation in ischemic heart disease ( IHD ) or critical limb ischemia / claudication or in the treatment of diabetic neuropathy of the lower extremities [ 142 ] . Reduction of blood flow in thromboem - bolic disease leads to collateral formation via arterio - genesis , a process during which preexisting arterioles enlarge , leading to a 10 - to 20 - fold increase in blood flow [ 143 ] . Arteriogenic pathways such as the PlGF - VEGFR - 1 pathway recruit monocytes and act directly on ECs and SMCs by inducing the growth of these cell populations . Recently , PlGF was reported to induce formation of vascular collaterals in experimental models of myocardial infarction and lower limb ischemia in mice by amplification of VEGF signaling [ 40 , 43 , 47 ] . Thus , VEGFR - 1 agonists are poten - tially useful in restoration of blood perfusion in settings of tissue ischemia . Human trials utilizing proangiogenic therapy have arrived at some successful endpoints [ 142 ] . Attempts at treating inoperable IHD have been made with gene transfer of VEGF by adenovirus and naked plasmid injections [ 144 , 145 ] . Preliminary reports targeting ischemic skeletal muscle suggested that in patients with critical limb ischemia / claudication , injection of VEGF plasmid may induce the growth of functional collateral vessels [ 146 ] . In the recent regional angiogenesis with VEGF ( RAVE ) randomized trial patients with claudication were treated with adenoviral delivery of VEGF 121 but the researchers failed to see clinical benefits [ 147 ] . However , VEGF driven angiogenesis in progressive ischemic disease may not be sufficient to restore the vascular perfusion because the formed vessels are not sufficiently functional , and even angiomas may develop [ 148 ] . Because of the permeability side effects of VEGF , it has been suggested that a combined approach with several growth factors such as T . Tammela et al . / Cardiovascular Research 65 ( 2005 ) 550 – 563 556 a t P e nn s y l v a n i a S t a t e U n i v e r s it y on F e b r u a r y 21 , 2013 h t t p : / / ca r d i ov a s c r e s . ox f o r d j ou r n a l s . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m VEGF and angiopoietins , platelet - derived growth factors , or the more arteriogenic PlGF may lead to better results [ 42 ] . 11 . 2 . The role of VEGF family growth factors in athero - sclerotic plaque formation Atherosclerotic plaque progression is associated with inflammatory angiogenesis through increased secretion of angiogenic growth factors such as VEGF and basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) [ 149 ] . Plaque angiogenesis results in atherosclerotic plaque growth , increased plaque instability and with the increase in the number of the adventitial vasa vasora , an increased risk of intraplaque hemorrhage [ 150 ] . These factors contribute to the growing instability of the atherosclerotic plaque . It is well known that plaque progression is associated with inflammatory cell recruitment and deposition of oxidized low - density lipoprotein ( OxLDL ) . OxLDL increases VEGF production and VEGF secretion by inflammatory cells in vitro [ 151 ] . The number of VEGF positive cells has been shown to correlate with the degree of atherosclerotic plaque vascularization [ 152 ] . Experimental atherosclerosis can be induced with VEGF and experimental atherosclerotic changes can be reduced with antiangiogenic therapy [ 153 , 154 ] . In a model of experimental cardiac allografts , VEGF was found to mediate the progression of arteriosclerosis [ 155 ] . However , recent results have sug - gested that the angiopoietins , another family of angiogenic molecules that bind and activate Tie2 tyrosine kinase receptors on ECs , could actually prevent some of the inflammatory changes in the vessel wall [ 156 ] . 11 . 3 . The role of endothelial progenitor cells in vascular pathology The blood circulation has been suggested to contain endothelial progenitor cells ( EPCs ) that incorporate into newly formed vessels at sites of active angiogenesis [ 157 ] . The EPCs are recruited to sites of angiogenesis where they differentiate in situ into mature endothelial cells much like during the embryonic vasculogenesis . EPCs express a variety of endothelial cell surface markers including platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule - 1 , von Willebrand factor ( vWF ) and VEGF receptors . EPCs are mobilized from the bone marrow by cytokines such as macrophage chemo - attractant protein - 1 ( MCP - 1 ) , transforming growth factor - beta ( TGF - h ) , VEGF and PlGF [ 157 ] . Skeletal muscle has also been suggested to contain cells with stem cell proper - ties that can contribute to angiogenesis , raising the possibility that tissues can contain resident angioblasts [ 158 ] . EPCs have been reported to incorporate into forming blood vessels during physiological angiogenesis such as during the female reproductive cycle , during pathologic angiogenesis in experimental solid tumors or in the limb muscles or the myocardium during ischemia [ 157 ] . How - ever , the capacity of bone marrow derived EPCs to incorporate into the vessel wall and transdifferentiate into mature ECs in vivo has also been questioned [ 159 – 161 ] . 11 . 4 . Tumor angiogenesis Blood vessels in tumors display several distinct features that have implications for tumor biology and treatment . Blood vessels in tumors have a chaotic structure and are leaky [ 162 ] . As a consequence , blood flow in the tumor is sluggish and the interstitial fluid pressure is high [ 162 ] . The sluggish blood flow results in hypoxic regions and perpetuates VEGF production while high interstitial fluid pressure within the tumor hampers delivery of therapeutic agents [ 162 ] . Since tumor growth is angiogenesis depend - ent , therapeutic targeting of the tumor vasculature is an attractive alternative or adjunct to conventional therapy . ECs in tumors express a number of molecules that are unique to blood vessels undergoing angiogenesis , such as VEGFR - 2 and integrin a V h 3 that can be targeted for therapeutic purposes . Furthermore , work by Ruoslahti et al . has demonstrated that angiogenic blood vessel endothelium expresses certain peptides / integrins on their cell surface and these markers may serve as b zip codes Q for targeting antiangiogenic molecules to tumor vessel endothelium [ 163 ] . An important step in antiangiogenic cancer therapy was recently taken when the anti - VEGF blocking antibody bevacizumab ( Genentech , USA ) showed remarkable results in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer , and it has recently been approved by the FDA for treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer [ 27 , 164 ] . This may only mark the beginning of antiangiogenic therapy for tumors , as at present bevacizumab is being evaluated in Phase III trials of metastatic breast cancer , nonsmall cell lung cancer , pancreatic cancer and renal cell carcinoma ( see www . clinicaltrials . gov ) . 11 . 5 . Some other human diseases involving angiogenesis Excessive ocular neovascularization contributes to visual loss in retinopathy of prematurity and diabetic retinopathy as well as in age - related macular degeneration . Retinal hypoxia and excessive secretion of angiogenic factors like VEGF leads to inappropriate retinal neovascularization and hemorrhages [ 165 ] . Experimental retinal neovascularization can be inhibited by antiangiogenic therapy [ 166 – 168 ] . Phase III clinical trials are underway to treat wet age - related macular degeneration with ranibizumab , an antibody frag - ment to VEGF ( Genentech USA ) . An aptamer inhibitor specific for the VEGF 165 isoform ( pegaptanib , EyeTech , USA ) has also entered phase II – III clinical trials with similar indications [ 169 ] . Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder characterized by dermal angiogenesis and overexpression of angiogenic factors such as VEGF [ 170 ] . In fact , trans - T . Tammela et al . / Cardiovascular Research 65 ( 2005 ) 550 – 563 557 a t P e nn s y l v a n i a S t a t e U n i v e r s it y on F e b r u a r y 21 , 2013 h t t p : / / ca r d i ov a s c r e s . ox f o r d j ou r n a l s . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m genic mice with sustained overexpression of murine VEGF in the skin have many of the classical features of psoriasis , and treatment with VEGF Trap , a VEGF antagonist ( Regeneron , USA ) , was shown to reverse this phenotype [ 23 ] . High VEGF levels are also involved in the pathologic angiogenesis observed in endometriosis and possibly also other gynecological disorders such as uterine bleeding disorders [ 171 ] . 11 . 6 . Lymphedemas In lymphedema , lymphatic drainage is impaired and protein - rich fluid accumulates in the subcutaneous tissue leading to fibrosis , impaired immune responses and fatty degeneration of the connective tissue . Lymphedemas are classified as primary , congenital lymphedemas and secon - dary or acquired lymphedemas . Secondary lymphedema is usually caused by filariasis or by iatrogenic trauma such as radiation therapy , surgery or infection [ 172 ] . Primary lymphedemas develop at birth or during adolescence . Congenital hereditary lymphedema , or Milroy disease , is characterized by hypoplastic superficial lymphatic vessels , while the lymphatics in Meige disease , or late - onset congenital lymphedema , appear enlarged and are dysfunc - tional [ 173 ] . The genetic defects underlying several primary lymphedemas have recently been characterized . In some patients with Milroy disease , missense mutations found in the TK domain of VEGFR - 3 inhibit the function of this receptor with resulting lymphedema [ 129 ] . In lymphedema distichiasis , mutations in the FOXC2 gene have been identified that lead to abnormal mural cell coating of lymphatic vessels and lack of lymphatic valves [ 174 , 175 ] . Other human diseases involving lymphedema with putative , as yet uncharacterized molecular mecha - nisms include Turner syndrome and cholestasis - lymphe - dema . 11 . 7 . Tumor lymphangiogenesis The intravasation of tumor cells into lymphatic vessels is one of the first steps in lymphatic metastasis . Lymphangio - genesis around solid tumors could promote lymphatic metastasis by providing a larger target for the intravasation of tumor cells [ 80 ] . Although enlarged lymphatic vessels at the tumor edge have occasionally been reported in human cancers , functional intratumoral lymphatic vessels have not been reported [ 79 , 176 ] . One explanation could be that the high interstitial fluid pressure in tumors compresses lymphatic vessels . According to another hypothesis , com - pressed lymphatic vessels seen in the tumor stroma did not arise by lymphangiogenesis but are preexisting lymphatic vessels that were engulfed by the expanding tumor [ 177 ] . Although lymphatic metastasis is not necessarily dependent on lymphangiogenesis [ 176 ] , tumor lymphangiogenesis has been reported to be a prognostic factor in cutaneous melanoma and squamous cell cancers of the head and neck [ 178 – 180 ] . Several reports have documented a correlation between expression levels of the lymphangiogenic factors VEGF - C and VEGF - D and lymphatic metastasis in cancer patients [ 80 ] . Thus the blocking of VEGF - C and VGEF - D signals with for example a soluble VEGFR - 3 - Ig fusion protein could be an attractive approach for inhibition of lymph node metastasis in human cancer patients , as already indicated by the results from preclinical studies [ 76 , 77 ] . 12 . Conclusion The vascular endothelial growth factors and their recep - tors play a paramount role in the development of the vascular system , via vasculogenic and angiogenic mechanisms , as well as in the formation of the lymphatic vascular system . Later in life , these molecules are required for processes involving tissue repair , such as wound healing and the cyclic reconstitution of the female endometrium . Aberrant angio - genesis is a key mechanism in the pathophysiology of , e . g . , atherosclerosis as well as tumor growth , while both angio - genesis and lymphangiogenesis may contribute to tumor metastasis . Controlling these processes with targeted molec - ular therapies is therefore at the heart of research directed at disease treatment . While proangiogenic therapies could be employed in the treatment of various ischemic diseases , generation of new lymphatic vessels could help patients with lymphedema . Meanwhile , a renaissance seems to be unrav - eling around the VEGF growth factors , as novel functions for them continue to be discovered outside the scope of vascular biology .
