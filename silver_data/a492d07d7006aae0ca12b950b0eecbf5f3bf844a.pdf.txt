Victor Small Institute of Molecular Biology , Austrian Academy of Sciences , A - 5020 Salzburg , Austria Abstract . We recently showed that substrate contact sites in living ﬁbroblasts are speciﬁcally targeted by mi - crotubules ( Kaverina , I . , K . Rottner , and J . V . Small . 1998 . J . Cell Biol . 142 : 181 – 190 ) . Evidence is now pro - vided that microtubule contact targeting plays a role in the modulation of substrate contact dynamics . The re - sults are derived from spreading and polarized goldﬁsh ﬁbroblasts in which microtubules and contact sites were simultaneously visualized using proteins conjugated with Cy - 3 , rhodamine , or green ﬂuorescent protein . For cells allowed to spread in the presence of nocoda - zole the turnover of contacts was retarded , as compared with controls and adhesions that were retained under the cell body were dissociated after microtubule reas - sembly . In polarized cells , small focal complexes were found at the protruding cell front and larger adhesions , corresponding to focal adhesions , at the retracting ﬂanks and rear . At retracting edges , multiple microtu - bule contact targeting preceded contact release and cell edge retraction . The same effect could be observed in spread cells , in which microtubules were allowed to re - assemble after local disassembly by the application of nocodazole to one cell edge . At the protruding front of polarized cells , focal complexes were also targeted and as a result remained either unchanged in size or , more rarely , were disassembled . Conversely , when contact targeting at the cell front was prevented by freezing mi - crotubule growth with 20 nM taxol and protrusion stim - ulated by the injection of constitutively active Rac , pe - ripheral focal complexes became abnormally enlarged . We further found that the local application of inhibitors of myosin contractility to cell edges bearing focal adhe - sions induced the same contact dissociation and edge retraction as observed after microtubule targeting . Our data are consistent with a mechanism whereby microtubules deliver localized doses of relaxing signals to contact sites to retard or reverse their development . We propose that it is via this route that microtubules exert their well - established control on cell polarity . Key words : cytoskeleton • signaling • contractility • cell polarity • actin T HE processes of polarization and cell motility of sub - strate - bound cells may be viewed as a competition between the motile compartment of the actin cy - toskeleton , comprising lamellipodia and filopodia , and the anchorage compartment , embracing the stress fiber bun - dles and focal adhesions . For cell translocation , these com - partments must be regionally segregated and this state re - quires an intact microtubule cytoskeleton ( Vasiliev and Gelfand , 1976 ) . Mounting evidence now indicates that the route by which microtubules exert their control on actin cytoskeleton organization and polarity impinges on the Rho - dependent pathways leading to substrate contact for - mation . Such a link was first indicated by the findings that microtubule disruption leads to the activation of Rho , with the consequent induction and enlargement of focal adhe - sions ( Danowski , 1989 ; Bershadsky et al . , 1996 ; Enomoto , 1996 ) . Further studies have provided evidence for a direct spatial interaction between microtubules and adhesion sites ( Kaverina et al . , 1998 ) . Thus , by simultaneously re - cording the dynamics of microtubules and substrate con - tacts in living fibroblasts , it was demonstrated that micro - tubule growth towards the cell periphery is associated with a specific targeting of substrate contact sites . Since sub - strate contacts were observed to confer stability against depolymerization to targeting microtubules and could also act as sites of microtubule nucleation during recovery from nocodazole , it was concluded that microtubule con - tact interfacing represents a functionally relevant process ( Kaverina et al . , 1998 ) . What influence , then , do microtubules have on substrate contact dynamics ? In this study we sought to clarify how J The online version of this article contains supplemental material .

Our findings are consistent with a mechanism whereby the turnover of con - tact sites is modulated by the delivery of relaxing impulses to contacts in a precise , site - specific manner via microtu - bule targeting . We propose that differential effects on con - tact sites , necessary to effect cell polarization , are achieved by the microtubule dependent delivery of relaxation sig - nals at different stages of contact maturation . Materials and Methods Cells Goldfish fin fibroblasts ( line CAR , no . CCL71 ; American Type Culture Collection ) were maintained in basal Eagle medium with Hanks’ BSS and nonessential amino acids and with 15 % fetal calf serum at 25 (cid:56) C . For ex - periments , cells were plated onto coverslips coated with human serum fi - bronectin ( Boehringer Mannheim GmbH ) for at least 48 h . Fibronectin was coated onto polylysine - treated coverslips by incubation on a drop of 50 (cid:109) g / ml fibronectin in PBS at 4 (cid:56) C overnight ; after rinsing in PBS these coverslips were used without drying . Fibronectin was stored as a stock so - lution in 2 M urea at 4 (cid:56) C . For polylysine coating , coverslips were incu - bated on a drop of aqueous 100 (cid:109) g / ml polylysine for 30 min at room tem - perature ( RT ) 1 , rinsed with water , dried , and UV sterilized . Microinjection Injections were performed with sterile Femtotips ( Eppendorf ) held in a Leitz Micromanipulator with a pressure supply from an Eppendorf Micro - injector 5242 . Cells were injected with a continuous outflow mode from the needle under a constant pressure of between 20 and 40 hPa . For local application of drugs , performed with the same system , a constant pressure of 50 – 100 hPa was used . Proteins for Microinjection and Drugs Tetramethyl rhodamine ( 5 - TAMRA ; Molecular Probes ) conjugated vin - culin from turkey gizzard was kindly provided by Mr . K . Rottner and Dr . M . Gimona ( Institute of Molecular Biology , Salzburg , Austria ) . Small ali - quots in 2 mg sucrose / mg protein were stored at (cid:50) 70 (cid:56) C . Before use , the fluorescent vinculin was dialyzed against 2 mM Tris - Acetate , pH 7 . 0 , 50 mM KCl , 0 . 1 mM DTE , and used at a concentration of (cid:122) 1 mg / ml . Cy3 - conjugated tubulin was kindly provided by J . Peloquin and Dr . G . Borisy ( University of Wisconsin , Madison , WI ) . It was stored at a concentration of 10 mg / ml in aliquots at (cid:50) 70 (cid:56) C . Rhodamine - conjugated rat tubulin was kindly provided by Drs . R . Tournebize and T . Hyman ( EMBL , Heidel - berg ) and stored at (cid:50) 70 (cid:56) C in 5 - (cid:109) l aliquots ( (cid:122) 20 mg / ml ) in BRB80 buffer ( 80 mM Pipes , pH 6 . 8 , 1 mM MgCl 2 , and 1 mM EGTA ) . For microinjec - tion , rhodamine tubulin aliquots were diluted 1 : 3 with Tris - acetate injec - tion buffer ( 2 mM Tris - acetate , pH 7 . 0 , 50 mM KCl , and 0 . 1 mM DTE ) and used on the same day . For coinjections , tubulin and vinculin were mixed after separate centrifugation for 10 or more min at 18 , 000 g in a proportion of 1 : 4 and used immediately . Recombinant L61Rac was kindly provided by K . Rottner ( using a con - struct originally provided by Professor A . Hall ) , dialyzed into 50 mM Tris ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM MgCl 2 , and 1 mM DTE for microinjection ( Nobes and Hall , 1995 ) , and injected at a concentration of 2 mg / ml . For local application through a microneedle , drugs were dissolved in microinjection buffer ( 2 mM Tris - Acetate , pH 7 . 0 , 50 mM KCl , and rhodamine dextran as a marker ) : the inhibitor of myosin light chain ki - nase , ML - 7 ( Alexis Corporation ) was used at a concentration of 2 mM ; the actomyosin inhibitor 2 , 3 - butanedione 2 - monoxime ( BDM ) was used as a saturated solution ( (cid:122) 500 mM ) ; and nocodazole ( Sigma Chemical Co . ) was used at a concentration of 160 (cid:109) M . Complete depolymerization of mi - crotubules for spreading experiments was achieved using a concentration of 2 . 5 (cid:109) g / ml . Cells were preincubated with nocodazole for 1 – 3 h and re - plated in the presence of the drug . Nocodazole was stored as a 16 - mM stock solution in DMSO . A low concentration ( 20 nM ) of taxol ( pacli - taxel ; Sigma Chemical Co . ) was used for suppression of microtubule dy - namics . Taxol was stored as an 10 mM stock solution in DMSO . The in - hibitor of p160ROCK , Y27632 ( Uehata et al . , 1997 ) , was added to culture medium at a concentration of 100 (cid:109) M , obtained by dilution from a 10 - mM stock solution in DMSO . Transfections For coexpression of GFP - fused proteins , mouse (cid:98) 3 tubulin in a pEGFP - C2 vector and human zyxin in a pEGFP - N1 vector were used . Both probes were kindly provided by Professor J . Wehland and coworkers ( BGF , Braunschweig , Germany ) . Subconfluent monolayer cultures on 30 - mm petri dishes were used for transfection . For each dish , the transfection mixture was prepared as follows : 1 (cid:109) g of EGFP - zyxin DNA and 2 (cid:109) g of EGFP - (cid:98) - tubulin DNA and 14 (cid:109) l of Superfect lipofection agent ( Qiagen ) were mixed in 400 (cid:109) l of serum - free medium . After 30 min incubation at RT a further 1 . 2 ml of medium containing 5 % serum was added . Cells were incubated in this mixture for 4 h at 25 (cid:56) C and the medium then re - placed by normal medium containing 15 % serum . After 24 h , cells were replated at a dilution of 1 : 15 onto coverslips for microscopy ( see Cells ) . The EGFP - zyxin expressing stable cell line was produced by transfec - tion as above using 3 (cid:109) g EGFP - zyxin DNA , followed by selection in 1 mg / ml G418 ( GIBCO ) - containing medium . Positive clones were identified in the fluorescence microscope and maintained in 0 . 4 mg / ml G418 - contain - ing medium . Video Microscopy Cells were injected and observed in an open chamber at RT on an in - verted microscope ( Axiovert 135TV ; Zeiss ) equipped for epifluorescence and phase contrast microscopy . Injections were performed at an objective magnification of 40 (cid:51) ( NA 1 . 3 Plan Neofluar ) and video microscopy with a 100 (cid:51) / NA 1 . 4 Plan - Apochromat with or without 1 . 6 optovar intermediate magnification . Filters blocking wavelengths below 590 nm were used for phase contrast illumination in order to avoid excitation of the fluorescent probe . Tungsten lamps ( 100 W ) were used for both transmitted and epi - illumination . Data were acquired with a back - illuminated , cooled CCD camera from Princeton Research Instruments driven by IPLabs software ( both from Visitron Systems ) and stored as 16 - bit digital images . The mi - croscope was additionally equipped with shutters ( Optilas GmbH ) driven through a homemade interface to allow separate recordings of video se - quences in phase contrast and fluorescence channels . Times between frames were 27 or 37 s . These time intervals are longer than used in the previous study ( 17 and 22 s in Kaverina et al . , 1998 ) , but were chosen so as to allow the recording of video sequences ( 50 – 100 frames ) long enough to observe substrate contact turnover . Under these compromise conditions , not all targeting events would have been recorded . The video sequences were analyzed and processed on a Macintosh Power PC 7100 / 80 using IP - Labs ( Visitron Systems ) and Adobe Photoshop 2 . 5 . 1 ( Adobe Systems , Inc . ) software . Fluorescence Microscopy For phalloidin stainings , cells were fixed for 10 min in 3 % paraformalde - hyde in cytoskeleton buffer ( CB : 10 mM MES , 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM EGTA , 5 mM glucose , and 5 mM MgCl 2 , pH 6 . 1 ) and extracted for 1 min in 0 . 25 % Triton X - 100 in the same buffer . Cy3 - Phalloidin was a kind gift of Professor H . Faulstich ( Max - Plank Institute , Heidelberg , Germany ) and was used at a concentration of 0 . 2 (cid:109) g / ml for 30 min at RT . Pictures of cells that were fixed and stained on the microscope were taken in 100 mM DTE in CB to avoid photobleaching . Quantitative Analysis For calculation of targeting frequency , 20 - (cid:109) m - wide regions of retracting and protruding edges of the same cells were compared . Contacts within 5 (cid:109) m of the cell edge were analyzed , and the number of targeting events for each contact in a time period of 15 min recorded . For comparison of the size of focal adhesions contact length was measured us - ing the IPLabs Measure Length tool . Focal contact turnover in spreading cells was determined by following the fate of contacts newly formed at 15 min after a further 15 - min period . All calculations and statistics were per - formed using KaleidaGraf version 2 . 3 . 1 . ( Synergy Software , Inc . ) . 1 .

Since freshly plated cells are more or less impossible to in - ject with fluorescent probes , we used goldfish fibroblasts ( CAR cells ) that had been stably transfected with EGFP - zyxin to follow contact dynamics during the spreading pro - cess . Fig . 1 shows typical examples of the contact dynamics of spreading cells in which the microtubule system was either intact ( Fig . 1 A ) , or disassembled by treatment before and during plating with nocodazole ( Fig . 1 B ) . For comparison , video frames are shown for the same times after plating . The first , evident difference is the greater rate of spread - ing in the presence of an intact microtubule cytoskeleton ; after 30 min , the total spread area of the cell in A was al - most twice that achieved without microtubules ( B ) . A sec - ond , notable difference was seen in the rate of turnover of the formed contact sites . This is best illustrated by refer - ring to the contact sites marked with arrowheads for each of the series shown in Fig . 1 . In A , the two marked con - tacts formed at the cell periphery at time 10 (cid:57) 00 (cid:48) after plat - ing were no longer existent at 30 (cid:57) 48 (cid:48) , having been super - ceded by new contacts formed under the advancing cell front . The same turnover of contacts was not seen in the presence of nocodazole . Instead , contacts formed at an early stage of spreading remained unchanged or elongated outwards ( Fig . 1 B , arrowheads ) . Analysis of contact fate was made in 9 cells by counting the number of contacts that disappeared between 15 and 30 min of spreading . In control cells , 75 % of a total of 91 contacts ( 4 cells ) disap - peared during this period , whereas only 22 % of a total of 99 contacts ( 5 cells ) disappeared in cells spreading in no - codazole . An influence of microtubules on substrate contact turn - over could also be observed during the reassembly of mi - crotubules in cells that had first been allowed to spread to their maximum extent in the presence of nocodazole . In this case ( Fig . 2 ) cells were used that had been transiently transfected with both EGFP - zyxin and EGFP - tubulin . As seen in Fig . 2 , the recovery of the microtubule network was associated with the disassembly of a large proportion of contacts in the perinuclear region of the cell . Out of 61 nonperipheral contacts , 29 disappeared during microtu - bule recovery and 32 were retained , but even these be - came smaller or less intense . Video sequences from a fur - ther 3 cells showed similar results . Elimination of Targeting Leads to Contact Growth Since the active growth of microtubules was essential for targeting to occur , we modified microtubule growth kinet - ics to establish how this affected contact dynamics . Micro - tubules were first stabilized by brief treatment with taxol ( 20 (cid:109) M , 30 min ) and then , still in the presence of taxol , selected cells were injected with constitutively active Figure 1 .

Microtubules and contacts were la - beled in this case by the preinjection of cells ( before taxol ) with rhodamine - conjugated tubulin and vinculin . An ex - ample of such an experiment is shown in Fig . 3 . At the time of Rac injection ( Fig . 3 A ; 0 (cid:57) 00 (cid:48) ) , microtubules ex - tended to the cell periphery but were no longer dynamic , according to the video analysis . Rac injection induced an advance of the cell edge as well as active rearward cytoplasmic flow and ruffling activity . The combination of the block in microtubule polymeriza - tion and the centripetal flow , sweeping microtubules rear - wards ( Waterman - Storer and Salmon , 1998 ) , created a mi - crotubule - free border behind the lamellipodium . In this region , contact sites that were only just visible at time 0 (cid:57) 00 (cid:48) ( white arrowheads in A ) had become enlarged and elongated at the end of the sequence ( Fig . 3 C ; 28 (cid:57) 14 (cid:48) ) . Notably , one peripheral contact ( indicated by hollow ar - row ) that had remained associated with the end of a mi - crotubule throughout did not increase in size . Measurements of 10 cells made 1 h after injection with L61Rac , 5 in the absence and 5 in the presence of taxol , re - vealed an average length of peripheral contacts , formed after Rac injection , of 0 . 67 (cid:54) 0 . 07 (cid:109) m for the control set ( total 472 contacts ) and 1 . 29 (cid:54) 0 . 12 (cid:109) m for the taxol - treated cells ( total 344 contacts ) . An example of a control cell injected with L61Rac is shown in Fig . 3 , D – F , with a comparison in the inset ( in F ) of the peripheral contacts in C ( taxol ) at the same magnification . Rho - kinase Independent Contact Sites Are also Targeted by Microtubules In a parallel study on Swiss 3T3 cells ( Rottner et al . , 1999 ) , it has been shown that the Rho kinase inhibitor , Y27632 ( Uehata et al . , 1997 ) , causes the dissolution of Rho - depen - dent focal adhesions , but not of Rac - dependent peripheral “focal complexes” ( Nobes and Hall , 1995 ) that are associ - ated with lamellipodium protrusion and membrane ruf - fling . As in Swiss 3T3 cells ( Rottner et al . , 1999 ) and HeLa cells ( Uehata et al . , 1997 ) , similar Rho - kinase independent focal complexes were found in CAR cells . Since many of these were elongated and associated with filopodia it is likely that their formation is not only dependent on Rac but also on Cdc42 . Analysis of a total of 14 cells treated with the Rho - kinase inhibitor showed that focal complexes were also targeted by microtubules . For these experiments , cells were doubly transfected with EGFP - tubulin and EGFP - zyxin . In the example shown in Fig . 4 , the cell was fixed af - ter the video sequence and stained with phalloidin ( Fig . 4 C ) to confirm that the concentration of Y27632 used ( 100 (cid:109) M ) had caused the disassembly of stress fiber bundles . As shown in the video sequence ( Fig . 4 D ) , one contact ( arrowhead ) that first appeared at 17 (cid:57) 24 (cid:48) was targeted be - tween 45 (cid:57) 09 (cid:48) and 45 (cid:57) 46 (cid:48) and had then dissociated 10 min later ( 55 (cid:57) 38 (cid:48) ) . Additional , new contacts were formed as the cell edge protruded beyond this contact site and these were also targeted by microtubules ( arrows at 64 (cid:57) 53 (cid:48) ) . Repetitive Targeting of Peripheral Focal Adhesions Precedes Cell Edge Retraction During cell motility , the trailing parts of a cell develop strong contacts with the substrate ( e . g . , Chen , 1981 ) and must be retracted to support the locomotory efforts of the cell front . It was therefore pertinent to analyze targeting activities in retracting regions , carried out in this case with fibroblasts coinjected with fluorescent tubulin and vin - culin . An example of a moving cell is shown in Fig . 5 in which a lateral flank was retracted , in concert with the protrusion of the anterior lamellipodium . The video sequences re - vealed that the contact targeting frequency in the trailing flank was several fold higher than in the protruding front . 10 peripheral contacts between the two asterisks shown in A were all multiply targeted by microtubules . The number of targeting events in total were 57 , amounting to an aver - age of 5 . 7 targeting interactions for each contact . The se - quence of events for one of the contacts is shown in Fig . 5 C . This contact , indicated at time 0 (cid:57) 0 (cid:48) with an open arrow , was targeted a total of 6 times , shown in the following 6 frames , and was retracted inwards after time 7 (cid:57) 42 (cid:48) , along with the rest of the cell edge . The frequency of contact tar - geting in the protruding cell front during the same se - quence was 0 . 75 , that is eightfold less than at the retracting flank . For two other cells , corresponding targeting fre - quencies at retracting , versus protruding edges were 4 . 1 versus 0 . 28 ( cell 2 ) and 4 . 3 versus 0 . 81 ( cell 3 ) . To further assess the consequences of contact targeting , Figure 2 . Focal adhesions are dissociated during recovery from nocodazole .

Microtubules Promote Dissociation of Substrate Contacts 1037 we examined the effect of short term recovery of microtu - bules from depolymerization by nocodazole . This was most conveniently achieved through the temporal applica - tion of nocodazole ( 50 (cid:109) g / ml ) through a micro - pipette to one side of a cell . When locally applied for 15 – 20 min , no - codazole caused the depolymerization of peripheral mi - crotubules in approximately one cell quadrant , adjacent to the needle tip ( not shown ) . The phase of recovery was as - sociated with either the retraction or protrusion of the cell edge and in both cases was accompanied by the dissolution of peripheral contact sites . A typical example of retraction ( total of 5 cells examined : total of 80 contacts ) is shown in Fig . 6 . In this example , 8 peripheral contacts were targeted by individual microtubules that grew out to the cell pe - riphery . Each targeting event was followed by a decrease in vinculin label in the contact , culminating with contact release and retraction of the cell edge . Contacts Can Be Remodeled and Contact Groups Tailored by Targeting Microtubules Two further aspects of contact targeting are shown in Fig . 7 . In Fig . 7 A , the fate is shown of the medially situated contact outlined by a circle in Fig . 5 . This contact , origi - nally oriented in the direction of cell protrusion ( single ar - rowhead , Fig . 7 ) , was subsequently divided into two con - tacts oriented along the axis of the retracting cell edge . Division of the contact was associated with microtubule targeting from opposite directions ( from below in the fig - ure at 0 (cid:57) 00 (cid:48) and 3 (cid:57) 40 (cid:48) and from above at 4 (cid:57) 46 (cid:48) and 5 (cid:57) 30 (cid:48) ) .

The spatially selective effect of targeting is likewise il - lustrated in the example shown in Fig . 7 B . Here , the fate of a closely packed group of contact sites is shown during microtubule recovery in a cell that had initially spread in the presence of nocodazole ( as for Fig . 2 ) . The cell was doubly transfected with EGFP - tagged tubulin and zyxin . During recovery , one of the contacts ( position marked by arrowhead ) disappeared from the group and this contact alone was targeted by microtubules , at times 3 (cid:57) 42 (cid:48) and 21 (cid:57) 35 (cid:48) . The selective dissolution of contact sites after mi - crotubule targeting during recovery from nocodazole was observed for 25 contacts in 11 cells . Locally Applied Contractility Inhibitors Mimic Microtubule - mediated Cell Edge Retraction and Destabilize Microtubules Since a link between microtubules and the tension devel - oped by stress fiber bundles has already been suggested ( see introduction ) , we considered that strain - dependent signals may play a role in the targeting process . If so , it was to be expected that the relaxation of tension by external means would affect microtubule - contact interactions . To test this presumption , relaxants of actomyosin contractility were applied locally to cells that had been preinjected with rhodamine - tagged tubulin and vinculin . As antagonists , we used the myosin light chain kinase inhibitor , ML - 7 , and the myosin antagonist , BDM . Con - centrations in the needle for local application were 2 mM for ML - 7 and (cid:122) 0 . 5 M ( saturated ) , for BDM . Since each in - hibitor gave essentially the same result , only one example , with ML - 7 , is shown ( Fig . 8 ) . In this figure the center of the ellipse corresponded to the point of application of the drug , with the needle directing the flow of inhibitor away from the cell edge . Two effects were observed . First , mi - crotubules depolymerized from affected cell edge and this was followed by the release of contacts and their inward retraction . Outside the region of ML - 7 influence ( top of cell in Fig . 8 ) , contact sites and microtubules were unaf - fected . The same result was obtained with a total of 5 cells treated with BDM ( total of 157 contacts analyzed ) and for 3 cells treated with ML - 7 ( total of 81 contacts analyzed ) . In parallel experiments , we treated CAR cells on cover - slips with 50 mM BDM , fixed them after different times , and performed immunolabeling for tubulin and vinculin . Under these conditions , microtubules shrank towards the cell center so that after 30 min only a remnant of the mi - crotubule cytoskeleton remained around the centrosome . Discussion Based on the observation that microtubule ends invaded vinculin positive contact sites in fibroblast lamellipodia , we earlier speculated ( Small and Rinnerthaler , 1985 ; Rin - nerthaler et al . , 1988 ) that microtubules act to stabilize or potentiate the growth of substrate adhesions . Our present findings indicate that quite the opposite is the case , namely that microtubules exert a negative influence on contact de - velopment . As we have recently demonstrated ( Kaverina Figure 4 . Rho - kinase inde - pendent contact sites are also targeted by microtubules .

Microtubules Promote Dissociation of Substrate Contacts 1039 et al . , 1998 ) , the interaction of microtubules with contact sites is by no means fortuitous , but entails a direct engage - ment that can involve a modulation in microtubule dy - namics . The present results show that microtubules , in a reciprocal manner , influence the development and turn - over of substrate contact sites . We propose that by this route microtubules exert the influence on the actin cyto - skeleton which underlies their control of cell polarization . By virtue of their fibrillar nature and dynamic growth characteristics , microtubules are ideally suited for the point delivery of molecular complexes . Since contact for - mation is under the control of the small Rho - GTPases it is most likely that microtubules intervene in one or more of their signaling pathways . Indeed , in vitro experiments have already revealed the association with microtubules of a number of potential candidates that could be involved , including Rac ( Best et al . , 1996 ) , the Rac / Rho GEFs , H1 ( Ren et al . , 1998 ) , and Vav ( Fernandez et al . , 1999 ) , as well as the oncoprotein Lfc ( Glaven et al . , 1999 ) . Since only the immediate proximity of microtubules affects the develop - ment of contact sites , we presume that the effectors re - sponsible for modulation are specifically concentrated at microtubule ends . In yeast , the accumulation or acquisi - tion of molecular assemblies at the ends of microtubules is evident during mitosis ( Saunders , 1999 ) and the concen - tration of tea1 at the ends of interphase microtubules ap - pears to play a role in the determination of cell polarity ( Mata and Nurse , 1997 ) . Further , in vertebrate fibroblasts , CLIP - 170 , whose Drosophila homologue binds myosin VI ( Lantz and Miller , 1998 ) , accumulates at the growing , but not at the shrinking ends of microtubules ( Perez et al . , 1999 ) . Regulatory factors could be delivered to the end of microtubules by molecular motors , one possible candidate being the Rac and Cdc42 effector MLK2 , which associates with KIF3 kinesin ( Nagata et al . , 1998 ) . A primary conclusion from this study is that factors con - centrated at the ends of microtubules are brought by mi - crotubule growth into the proximity of substrate contacts to influence their development , by modulating acto - myo - sin contractility . Acto - myosin – based contractility , stimu - lated via phosphorylation of the myosin II regulatory light chain , has been shown necessary for the formation of stress fiber bundles and focal adhesions ( reviewed in Schoenwalder and Burridge , 1999 ) . Accordingly , inhibi - tors of contractility , such as BDM , or of myosin light chain kinase , cause the dissociation of focal adhesions , or block their formation in response to the upregulation of Rho ( Chrzanowska and Burridge , 1996 ) . Other studies ( re - viewed in Narumiya et al . , 1997 ) have shown that the Rho - associated kinase , p160ROCK or Rho - kinase , acts down - stream of Rho and stimulates myosin phosphorylation by inhibiting the myosin light chain phosphatase . At the same time , it has become apparent that not all substrate contact sites depend on Rho - kinase for their formation . In particu - lar , peripheral contact assemblies similar to focal com - plexes induced by Rac ( Nobes and Hall , 1995 ) are formed in cells in which Rho - kinase is specifically inhibited ( Ue - hata et al . , 1997 ; Rottner et al . , 1999 ) . Despite their inde - pendence of Rho - kinase , these contact sites are likewise dissociated by both BDM and ML - 7 ( Rottner et al . , 1999 ) and therefore also depend on myosin II – based contractil - ity for their maintenance . Thus , the development of Rho - kinase – independent contacts , which serve to support the protrusive activity of the cell front ( Rottner et al . , 1999 ) may also be regulated via modulations in contractility . Since targeting events correlated with the diminution , retraction , or dissociation of contact sites , it is evident that microtubule targeting serves to antagonize contact devel - opment . This was supported by our finding that a block in targeting activity caused the uncontrolled growth of pe - ripheral contacts . Former studies ( Danowski , 1989 ; Ber - shadsky et al . , 1996 ) have linked microtubule disassembly with the enhancement of contractility . We propose that a converse mechanism exists whereby the targeted growth of microtubules into contact sites mediates a highly local - ized relaxation and that this is the mechanism by which contact growth is reversed or retarded . Consistent with this conclusion was the finding that intensive targeting of contacts at cell edges and the application of myosin inhibi - tors produced similar effects . As we have seen , the retraction of an adhesion site at a Figure 5 . Repetitive targeting of peripheral focal adhesions pre - cedes cell edge retraction .

These findings are generally supported by the sta - tistical characterization of regional microtubule dynamics by Wadsworth ( 1999 ) ; her studies showed that microtu - bule ends close to nonmotile edges exhibited shorter ex - cursions and frequent catastrophes , whereas longer ex - cursions and fewer catastrophes occurred in protruding regions . The shorter and more frequent excursions would correspond to what we observe at cell edges destined for retraction . We conclude that a single targeting event serves to provide a quantum relaxation dose and that fur - ther doses , as required , must be supplied by freshly Figure 6 .

Microtubules Promote Dissociation of Substrate Contacts 1041 charged microtubule ends in subsequent targeting forays . By modulating the number of targeting events , differential relaxation effects may then be exerted on contact assem - blies in different regions of a cell . In this way , microtubule signaling at contact sites could modulate the substrate con - tact pattern of a cell and thereby determine its polarity ( Fig . 9 ) . In a recent study , Pelham and Wang ( 1999 ) provided the most detailed tension patterns yet of a locomoting fibro - blast . Their results show a high , but fluctuating level of tension at the cell front and a lower but constant tension in the trailing cell rear . It is further proposed that mechanical forces play an important role in signal transduction . In this context , we suggest that microtubules are important play - ers in these signal transduction events . In response to ten - sion - sensing cues propagated through the actin cytoskele - ton , microtubules could be guided to contact sites to control tension according to the requirements for protru - sion or retraction . Indeed , the rapid depolymerization of microtubules in response to the treatment of cells with contractility inhibitors may reflect a general dependence of microtubule stability on a stressed actin cytoskeleton . It is noteworthy that the microtubule destabilizing effect we observed with myosin inhibitors was not detected in previous studies ( Lin et al . , 1996 ; Waterman - Storer and Salmon , 1997 ) . This can be explained for BDM by the use here of both higher concentrations and longer times ; a higher sensitivity of CAR cells to BDM can also not be ex - cluded . That the effect was not simply an artefact induced by high concentrations of BDM is suggested by the obser - Figure 8 .

Schematic illustra - tion of substrate contact dynamics in a moving fibro - blast . ( Top ) Substrate con - tacts are initiated in the protruding and ruffling la - mellipodium ( Lam , ruf ) . Two classes of primary contacts are depicted : punctate focal complexes ( fc ) and linear contacts associated with some microspike bundles ( ms / c ) . Their formation is as - sociated with the activation of Rac and Cdc42 , respec - tively . Each type of primary contact can develop into a precursor of a focal adhesion ( pFA ) . Further abbrevia - tions : iFA , intermediate focal adhesion in the body of the cell ; tFA , focal adhesion at a trailing cell edge . ( Bottom ) Four types of contact sites with different strengths of anchorage to the sub - strate ( anchors ) are depicted and correspond to those in the upper diagram . All sites rely on contractility for their maintenance , indi - cated by different levels of myosin II – dependent tension ( T and t ) . For precursor ( pFA ) and mature focal adhesions ( iFA , tFA ) , myosin activation depends on Rho - kinase . The contractility of focal complexes is Rho - kinase independent . Microtubules ( MT ) interface with contact sites and modulate their turnover by locally inhibiting contractility . The relaxing dose is controlled by the total number and fre - quency of microtubule targeting events . Focal complexes may or may not be targeted by microtubules . on J une 24 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published September 6 , 1999 The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 146 , 1999 1042 vation that the myosin light chain kinase inhibitor , ML - 7 , produced the same result . Chrzanowska and Burridge ( 1996 ) showed that the alternative inhibitor , H - 7 , applied at a concentration of 300 (cid:109) M for 30 min dissociates focal adhesions in REF - 52 fibroblasts ; under these same condi - tions , we also observed microtubule destabilization , culmi - nating in the shrinkage of the microtubule cytoskeleton to the perinuclear area ( not shown ) . In line with our own studies , Cook et al . ( 1998 ) found that elevated levels of Rho , which increases contractility , lead to a stabilization of microtubules . An alternative view of the way microtubules may deter - mine cell polarity has been put forward by Waterman - Storer et al . ( 1999 ) , who showed that the polymerization of microtubules during the recovery of Swiss 3T3 cells from nocodazole was associated with the upregulation of Rac and the corresponding induction of membrane ruf - fling . They suggested that this effect may be explained by the generation of Rac - GTP at microtubule ends . Such a mechanism was , however , difficult to reconcile with the continued elevation of Rac - GTP long after microtubule polymerization was complete ( Waterman - Storer et al . , 1999 ) . As in earlier studies ( Bershadsky and Vasiliev , 1988 ; Rinnerthaler et al . , 1988 ; Sammak and Borisy , 1988 ) , these authors noted a penetration of microtubules into re - gions of active protrusion and further noted a correlation between protrusive activity and dynamic microtubule growth , rather than with polymer mass . However , protrud - ing cell edges in rapidly motile cells can have very few associated microtubules ( Euteneuer and Schliwa , 1984 ; Wadsworth , 1999 ; our unpublished observations ) , making it unlikely that active Rac is generated from microtubule ends at the cell front . An alternative explanation of their result is provided by the finding that Rac and Rho antago - nize each others activities ( Kozma et al . , 1997 ; van Leeu - wen et al . , 1997 ; Hirose et al . , 1998 ; Moorman et al . , 1999 ; Rottner et al . , 1999 ) . As has previously been demon - strated , microtubule depolymerization leads to the upreg - ulation of Rho ( Bershadsky et al . , 1996 ; Enomoto , 1996 ) and microtubule polymerization to its downregulation , re - flected here in the dissolution of focal adhesions during re - covery from nocodazole . We surmise that the upregulation of Rac observed during microtubule polymerization ( Wa - terman - Storer et al . , 1999 ) is an indirect result of the downregulation of Rho ( Rottner et al . , 1999 ) and not to the microtubule - dependent generation of Rac at the cell front . Further work will be required to demonstrate the means of guidance of microtubules to contact sites and the nature of the relaxing signal they convey to regulate contact dy - namics . As regards the signal , since both Rho - kinase – dependent focal adhesions and Rho - kinase – independent focal complexes are modulated by microtubule targeting , we conclude that the point of intervention of microtubule - bound modulators in the pathway leading to contractility is downstream of Rho - kinase .
