A splice variant of CD44 expressed in the apical ectodermal ridge presents fibroblast growth factors to limb mesenchyme and is required for limb outgrowth Larry Sherman , 1 , 2 David Wainwright , 1 Helmut Ponta , and Peter Herrlich 3 Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe , Institut fu¨r Genetik , D - 76021 Karlsruhe , Germany Signals from the apical ectodermal ridge ( AER ) of the developing vertebrate limb , including fibroblast growth factor - 8 ( FGF - 8 ) , can maintain limb mesenchymal cells in a proliferative state . We report here that a specific CD44 splice variant is crucial for the proliferation of these mesenchymal cells . Epitopes carried by this variant colocalize temporally and spatially with FGF - 8 in the AER throughout early limb development . A splice variant containing the same sequences expressed on model cells binds both FGF - 4 and FGF - 8 and stimulates mesenchymal cells in vitro . When applied to the AER , an antibody against a specific CD44 epitope blocks FGF presentation and inhibits limb outgrowth . Therefore , CD44 is necessary for limb development and functions in a novel growth factor presentation mechanism likely relevant in other physiological and pathological situations where a cell surface protein presents a signaling molecule to a neighboring cell . [ Key Words : CD44 ; FGF ; limb development ; apical ectodermal ridge ] Received October 29 , 1997 ; revised version accepted January 27 , 1998 . The growth and differentiation of the developing verte - brate limb are initiated and maintained by interactions between proliferating mesenchymal cells and their over - lying ectoderm ( Harrison 1918 ) . Mesenchymal cells con - tributing to the limb originate from the lateral plate me - soderm and their initial proliferation is stimulated by signals from the embryonic kidney ( Stephens and Mc - Nulty 1981 ; Strecker and Stephens 1983 ; Geduspan and Solursh 1992 ) . In birds and mammals , the accumulation of these mesenchymal cells then induces the ectoderm along the anterior to posterior rim to elongate and form a specialized structure called the apical ectodermal ridge ( AER ) . Upon differentiation , the AER maintains the proximodistal outgrowth of the limb bud by keeping ad - jacent mesenchymal cells in an undifferentiated prolif - erating state ( Zwilling 1955 ; Rubin and Saunders 1972 ; Summerbell et al . 1973 ) . These proliferating cells consti - tute the so - called progress zone of the limb bud . Particular members of the fibroblast growth factor ( FGF ) family can substitute for the growth - promoting functions of the AER and could be involved in the ini - tiation of limb development ( for review , see Yamaguchi and Rossant 1995 ; Cohn and Tickle 1996 ) . These poly - peptide growth factors affect cell motility , proliferation , survival , and differentiation in numerous cell types by binding to high affinity FGF receptors ( for review , see Mason 1994 ) . Among the known FGF proteins , FGF - 2 ( Savage et al . 1993 ; Dono and Zeller 1994 ) , FGF - 4 ( Niswander and Martin 1992 ; Suzuki et al . 1992 ) , and FGF - 8 ( Heikinheimo et al . 1994 ; Ohuchi et al . 1994 ; Crossley and Martin 1995 ; Mahmood et al . 1995 ; Cross - ley et al . 1996 ; Vogel et al . 1996 ; Ohuchi et al . 1997 ) are expressed in the AER . Heparin - coated beads loaded with any of these proteins can initiate the development of ectopic limbs when inserted into the flank of chick em - bryos , and can sustain limb development when placed on limb buds lacking an AER ( Niswander et al . 1993 ; Niswander and Martin 1993 ; Fallon et al . 1994 ; Cohn et al . 1995 ; Mahmood et al . 1995 ; Crossley et al . 1996 ; Vo - gel et al . 1996 ; Ohuchi et al . 1997 ) . However , only FGF - 8 is expressed in prelimb ectoderm and later becomes re - stricted to the entire AER . The binding of FGF proteins to their high affinity re - ceptors may require several steps ( for review , see Vlo - davsky et al . 1996 ) . For example , the association of FGF proteins with cell – surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans ( HSPGs ) is a prerequisite for high affinity FGF receptor activation ( Heath et al . 1991 ; Rapraeger et al . 1991 ; Yayon et al . 1991 ; Ornitz et al . 1992 ; Spivak - Kroizman et 1 These authors contributed equally to the experimental work described in this paper . 2 Present address : Department of Cell Biology , Neurobiology and Anatomy , University of Cincinnati College of Medicine , Cincinnati , Ohio 45267 USA . 3 Corresponding author .

There is also grow - ing evidence that additional HSPGs in the extracellular matrix can sequester and store secreted FGF proteins , and protect them from proteolytic degradation ( Folkman et al . 1980 ; Gospodarowicz and Cheng 1986 ; Vlodavsky et al . 1987 ; Saksela et al . 1988 ; Cardon - Cardo et al . 1990 ; Gonzalez et al . 1990 ; Ishai - Michaeli et al . 1992 ) . There - fore , it is likely that HSPGs in the developing limb have one or more of these functions and are crucial for the regulated activities of FGF proteins during limb morpho - genesis . In the present study , we have investigated the role of CD44 proteins in early limb development . Members of this family of transmembrane glycoproteins are ex - pressed by cells of the limb bud , including those of the AER ( Wheatley et al . 1993 ; Yu et al . 1996 ) . Distinct CD44 variants are generated from a single gene by the alternative RNA splicing of up to 10 variant ( ‘‘v’’ ) exons and by extensive post - translational modifications . The amino acid sequences encoded by these variant exons are located in the extracellular portion of the protein near the transmembrane domain ( Screaton et al . 1992 ; To¨lg et al . 1993 ) . A standard form of CD44 ( CD44s ) lacking these variant sequences is expressed by numerous cell types and is the smallest CD44 protein . It carries no variant exon sequences . Splice variants are only expressed in a limited number of tissues and in certain tumors ( for re - view , see Sherman et al . 1996 ; Naor et al . 1997 ) . Particular CD44 proteins are likely to have distinct molecular properties . Our interest in these proteins stems from the finding that specific CD44 splice variants can contribute to the growth and metastasis of tumor cells ( Gu¨nthert et al . 1991 ; for reviews , see Sherman et al . 1996 ; Naor et al . 1997 ) . CD44 proteins have also been implicated in cell – cell adhesion ( Jalkanen et al . 1987 ; St . John et al . 1990 ; DeGrendele et al . 1996 ) , cell migration and invasion ( Thomas et al . 1992 ; Lamb et al . 1997 ) , and cell – matrix interactions , including binding to gly - cosaminoglycans such as hyaluronate , chondroitin sul - fate , and heparan sulfate ( Wayner and Carter 1987 ; Aruffo et al . 1990 ; Culty et al . 1990 ; Lesley et al . 1990 ; Jalkanen and Jalkanen 1992 ; Sleeman et al . 1997 ) . Fur - thermore , certain CD44 proteins can be modified by gly - cosaminoglycans , which enable them to bind growth fac - tors such as FGF - 2 ( Brown et al . 1991 ; Faassen et al . 1992 ; Tanaka et al . 1993 ; Jackson et al . 1995 ; Bennett et al . 1995a ) . For these reasons it is conceivable that CD44 may play one or more of these roles in the developing limb bud , where numerous cell – cell and cell – matrix in - teractions occur and where tightly regulated cellular sig - naling between the AER , limb ectoderm , and mesen - chyme is required . It is also possible that the mecha - nisms used by CD44 in the embryonic limb are recapitulated during certain pathological processes , in - cluding tumor progression . We report here that a CD44 variant carrying the alter - natively spliced sequences encoded by variant exons v3 and v6 are required during early limb development . This variant characterized by v3 - and v6 - encoded epitopes is expressed initially by prelimb ectoderm and later be - comes restricted to the AER . It is coexpressed temporally and spatially with FGF - 8 in many embryonic tissues and colocalizes with FGF - 8 on the surfaces of AER cells . Transfected cells bearing CD44v3 – v10 can bind FGF - 8 ( as well as FGF - 4 ) and present it to limb mesenchymal cells in vitro . ( CD44v3 – v10 indicates a CD44 protein that carries the amino acid sequences encoded by exons v3 – v10 in addition to the constant CD44 structure . ) CD44v5 would be a protein with only the v5 sequence in addition to the constant sequences . Furthermore , antibodies rec - ognizing v3 and v6 epitopes inhibit FGF - 8 presentation and limb bud outgrowth . These data indicate that CD44 is crucial for maintaining the growth - promoting func - tions of the AER and reveal a novel growth factor pre - sentation mechanism , whereby a cell surface protein presents FGF to receptors on opposing cells . Results CD44 variants are expressed in prelimb ectoderm and in the AER CD44 proteins were detected previously throughout the developing mouse limb bud using an antibody recogniz - ing the common amino terminus of all CD44 proteins ( Wheatley et al . 1993 ) . To characterize which CD44 pro - teins are expressed by the different structures of the de - veloping limb , we examined CD44 expression in rat em - bryos between embryonic days ( E ) 10 . 5 and 12 . 5 using whole mount immunohistochemistry with either an an - tibody that recognizes all CD44 proteins ( 5G8 , epitope encoded by exon 15 ; Sleeman et al . 1996 ) or one that recognizes only CD44 proteins containing sequences en - coded by CD44 exon v6 ( 1 . 1ASML ; Gu¨nthert et al . 1991 ) . Compared to total CD44 expression ( Fig . 1A ) , which was identical to that reported in the mouse ( Wheatley et al . 1993 ) , CD44v6 epitope expression was highly restricted in E11 . 5 ( Wainwright et al . 1996 ) and E12 . 5 rat embryos , with the strongest staining occurring in the AER ( Fig . 1B ) . Similar results were obtained with an antibody against a v3 epitope and by in situ hybridization using v2 and v4 sequences as riboprobes ( not shown ) . Some CD44v6 epitope staining was also evident in the vitel - line vein and branchial arches , and , upon sectioning , in the developing forebrain ( data not shown ) . In contrast to total CD44 expression , the v6 epitope could not be de - tected in the notochord or somites . In E10 . 5 embryos , CD44v6 was strongest in the ectoderm of the branchial arches ( Fig . 1C ) and in the putative forelimb ectoderm , between somites 7 and 14 ( Fig . 1C , D ) . No CD44v6 was detected in the mesenchyme of either the branchial arches or early limb buds . To identify the splice composition of the CD44 tran - scripts expressed in limb buds , we analyzed poly ( A ) + RNA from either dissected rat E12 . 5 AER tissue or from distal limb mesenchyme and ectoderm using an RT – PCR - based assay ( van Weering et al . 1993 ; Wainwright et al . 1996 ) . We found that the AER expresses a CD44 splice variant containing all of the variant exon sequences ( CD44v1 – v10 ; see Fig . 2A ) , whereas the remainder of the CD44 presents FGFs to limb bud mesenchymal cells GENES & DEVELOPMENT 1059 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press on November 2 , 2017 - Published by genesdev . cshlp . org Downloaded from limb bud expresses only CD44s ( Fig . 2B ) . This result agrees with our in situ hybridizations and immunohis - tochemistry results described above . The PCR strategy used here does not allow for the identification of mul - tiple transcripts with consecutive variant exon se - quences all ending with exon v10 . Such PCR products would be hidden underneath the laddering . Therefore , we further analyzed AER tissue using a different set of primers ( not shown ) . Consistent with results from an - other laboratory ( Yu et al . 1996 ) , we identified additional CD44 splice variants with v3 – v10 , v4 – v10 , v6 – v10 , and v8 – v10 sequences . CD44v3 – v10 is the most prominent species . The same relative abundance of CD44v3 – v10 is documented in the first lane of Figure 2A ( primers out - side the v region , lane FULL , expected size 1 . 25 kb ) , whereas a CD44v1 – v10 - derived PCR product is barely visible . Also a CD44s transcript was detected in the AER sample . Part or all of the CD44s signal may have origi - nated from contaminating mesenchymal cells , as it was not possible to remove all of the mesenchyme from the dissected AER tissue . Western blot analysis of CD44 pro - teins immunoprecipitated from whole limb buds dem - onstrated the expression of one major CD44 variant pro - tein with an apparent molecular mass of ~ 230 kD and of several smaller CD44 variant proteins ranging in size from ~ 90 to 140 kD ( see Fig . 1E ) . Because PCR data local - ized variants exclusively to the AER , we assume that the 230 - kD protein is carried by AER cells and represents the major CD44v3 – v10 variant . These data indicate that splice variants of CD44 carrying v3 and v6 sequences are ex - pressed by putative limb ectoderm during the initiation of limb bud formation and later become localized to the AER . A CD44v6 - specific antibody blocks limb outgrowth Because CD44 splice variants are localized to the AER Figure 2 . CD44 transcripts expressed in the AER . RT – PCR analysis of RNA isolated from AER tissue ( A ) and the rest of the limb bud ( B ) of E12 . 5 rat embryos . After cDNA synthesis , the PCR protocol of van Weering et al . ( 1993 ) was followed ( see Materials and Methods ) . In brief , CD44 sequences were first amplified using 5 (cid:56) and 3 (cid:56) primers ( in the constant region of CD44 ) , then this product was amplified further using a second 3 (cid:56) primer and either a second 5 (cid:56) primer located in the constant region ( a probe of which is loaded in lane FULL ) or variant exon - specific 5 (cid:56) primers ( v1 – v10 ) . The products of the second reaction were then analyzed on an agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide . ( WATER ) No cDNA ; ( −RT ) without reverse transcriptase during the initial cDNA synthesis . The PCR prod - uct for CD44s is 421 bp in lane FULL . Note that the sizes in lanes v1 – v10 are not comparable to the FULL lane as different primers were used ( see also Ko¨nig et al . 1996 ) .

Sherman et al . 1060 GENES & DEVELOPMENT Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press on November 2 , 2017 - Published by genesdev . cshlp . org Downloaded from throughout the course of early limb development , we postulated that these CD44 proteins could play a role in limb bud outgrowth . The CD44v6 - specific antibody used above ( 1 . 1ASML ) had been shown previously to inhibit the activity of CD44 splice variants in several biological systems ( Reber et al . 1990 ; Arch et al . 1992 ; Seiter et al . 1993 ; Weiss et al . 1997 ) . To test whether this antibody might similarly inhibit CD44 functions in the AER , we examined how 1 . 1ASML influenced limb development compared to the isotype - matched 5G8 antibody , which recognizes another CD44 epitope that is proximal to the membrane , and also to 1 . 1ASML , which had been prein - cubated with the v6 epitope peptide . The AERs of rat embryos isolated at a stage soon after AER formation ( E11 . 5 , equivalent to mouse limb stage 2 ; see Wanek et al . 1989 ) , were removed aseptically from the developing right forelimbs using tungsten needles , incubated with antibodies , then grafted back onto the limb bud ( scheme in Fig . 3 ) . After 4 days in culture , limb buds from em - bryos that had received 1 . 1ASML - treated AERs ( n = 14 ) were significantly shorter ( by > 50 % ) than unoperated control limbs ( Fig . 3 , cf . B with A , quantitation in C ) . In one set of experiments , the AER was removed and not grafted back onto the wounded limb bud . In each case ( n = 3 ) , limb bud outgrowth was inhibited to at least a similar degree as limbs that had received 1 . 1ASML - treated AER grafts . There were no significant differences in limb bud lengths between untreated limb buds and limb buds in embryos that had received AERs treated with 5G8 ( n = 13 ) or 1 . 1ASML in combination with the CD44v6 peptide ( n = 3 ) ( Fig . 3C ) . Therefore , the effects of 1 . 1ASML were specific and not attributable to cytotox - icity . To further support that 1 . 1ASML treatment did not reduce the viability of AER cells upon binding , 5G8 - and 1 . 1ASML - treated AER tissue was examined for FGF - 8 RNA synthesis by in situ hybridization at 24 hr . In both cases similar levels of FGF - 8 RNA were detected ( not shown ) indicating that 1 . 1ASML does not affect the vi - ability of AER cells . This conclusion is consistent with trypan blue exclusion experiments , which showed mar - ginal staining or no staining at all in all operated limbs ( not shown ) . The limb bud from 1 of the 13 embryos treated with 5G8 demonstrated a partial malformation in the most anterior portion of the limb , where growth appeared to be arrested . This was likely , however , to be an artifact of the grafting procedure . To determine whether the 1 . 1ASML antibody has non - specific effects on mesenchymal cell growth or whether it can influence AER function without being directly in contact with the basal surface of AER , embryos were cultured as described above except that the AERs were left intact . Instead , the mesenchyme subjacent to the AER ( corresponding to the progress zone ) on the right limb bud was exposed using a tungsten needle . These embryos were then cultured in medium lacking antibod - ies or in the presence of either 1 . 1ASML or 5G8 . The mesoderm remained exposed to antibodies for several hours , after which time the overlying ectoderm healed . After 4 days in culture , no significant differences in limb bud development or length were observed between em - bryos grown in medium alone ( n = 3 ; left , 1 . 03 ± 0 . 15 mm ; right , 1 . 07 ± 0 . 06 mm ) or in medium supplemented with 1 . 1ASML ( n = 5 ; left , 1 . 06 ± 0 . 39 ; right , 0 . 92 ± 0 . 34 ) or 5G8 ( n = 5 ; left , 1 . 12 ± 0 . 19 ; right , 1 . 1 ± 0 . 1 ) . These data indicate that the 1 . 1ASML antibody can only in - hibit limb outgrowth when directly in contact with the basal surface of the AER . AER - induced limb bud mesenchymal cell proliferation is inhibited by a CD44v6 - specific antibody in a coculture assay To study the function of CD44 in the AER and the means by which the 1 . 1ASML antibody blocks limb bud outgrowth , we tested the effects of 1 . 1ASML on the pro - liferation - promoting ability of AER tissue when placed into coculture with dissociated primary limb bud mes - enchymal cells .

CD44 presents FGFs to limb bud mesenchymal cells GENES & DEVELOPMENT 1061 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press on November 2 , 2017 - Published by genesdev . cshlp . org Downloaded from embryos were dissected from each other and the mesen - chymal cells were dissociated and grown as a monolayer . After reaching ~ 70 % confluency , fragments of freshly isolated AER tissue were added either directly to the mesenchymal monolayers or after pretreatment with the CD44 - specific antibodies 5G8 , 1 . 1ASML , or 1 . 1ASML preblocked with its recognition peptide . After 16 hr of coculture , the cells were pulse - labeled for 4 hr with [ 3 H ] thymidine to measure their proliferative state . AER tissue in the absence of mesenchymal cells ( Fig . 4 , col - umn 2 ) or upon removal from cocultures ( not shown ) did not incorporate [ 3 H ] thymidine . In the presence of AER tissue , mesenchymal cells incorporated significantly greater amounts of [ 3 H ] thymidine than mesenchymal cells cultured alone ( Fig . 4 , cf . column 3 with column 1 ) . The stimulatory effects of the AER could be inhibited by the 1 . 1ASML antibody , but not by the 5G8 antibody or 1 . 1ASML that had been preincubated with a CD44v6 peptide ( Fig . 4 , columns 4 , 5 , 6 ) . These results confirm that the 1 . 1ASML antibody can inhibit the growth - pro - moting function of the AER and suggest that CD44 pro - teins recognized by the antibody are required for mesen - chymal cell proliferation . CD44 colocalizes with FGF - 8 in the developing limb There is no evidence to suggest that CD44 itself can function as a cell - bound growth factor . As described above , because FGF - 8 is expressed throughout the AER and is likely to be one of the major signals maintaining limb bud mesenchymal cell proliferation , we reasoned that there could be a relationship between the functions of CD44 and FGF - 8 in the developing limb . Therefore , we determined whether CD44 is coexpressed with FGF - 8 in the developing rat embryo by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry . Using multiple CD44 variant exon - specific riboprobes and a probe for FGF - 8 , we found that CD44 and FGF - 8 are coexpressed at E12 . 5 in the AER , branchial arches , and forebrain ( data not shown ) . The CD44v6 epitope was also detected in prelimb ecto - derm of E10 . 5 embryos ( see Fig . 1D ) , at stages of devel - opment similar to when FGF - 8 was reported to be ex - pressed in mouse and chicken embryos ( Heikinheimo et al . 1994 ; Crossley and Martin 1995 ; Mahmood et al . 1995 ; Crossley et al . 1996 ) . To determine whether CD44 variants and FGF - 8 proteins were colocalized in the same cellular compartments , we examined CD44v6 epitope and FGF - 8 expression in frozen sections of limb buds from E12 . 5 embryos with double - labeling immunohisto - chemistry using 1 . 1ASML and a polyclonal FGF - 8 anti - body . As shown in Figure 5 , the CD44v6 epitope and FGF - 8 colocalize to the surfaces of AER cells . Therefore , CD44 variant proteins and FGF - 8 are colocalized tempo - rally and spatially in the AER and are expressed con - comitantly at the onset of limb development . FGF - 8 and FGF - 4 bind to CD44v3 – v10 As described in the introductory section , particular CD44 variants can bind to or be modified by gly - cosaminoglycans . For example , CD44 species carrying the v6 and v7 exon sequences have increased affinity for heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate ( Sleeman et al . 1997 ) . CD44 variants carrying the sequences encoded by exon v3 are modified covalently by heparan sulfate and can bind heparin - binding growth factors ( Bennett et al . 1995a ) . Because the AER expresses CD44 proteins con - taining sequences encoded by exon v3 , and as members of the FGF family bind to HSPGs , we explored whether CD44 proteins can bind FGF4 and FGF8 . It is difficult to analyze directly CD44 – FGF interactions in limb tissues because the AER itself produces several FGFs and CD44 variant proteins . Therefore , we used a cell culture sys - tem where we could easily manipulate CD44 expression . Namalwa Burkitt lymphoma cells , which do not express any CD44 ( Sy et al . 1991 ) and do not produce detectable heparan sulfate ( Fig . 6 ) , had been stably transfected pre - viously with either human CD44v3 – v10 , CD44v8 – v10 , or CD44s . Human and rat CD44 amino acid sequences Figure 4 . AER - mediated proliferation of primary mesenchy - mal cells in culture .

AER fragments were independently collected , treated either in PBS or in PBS containing 5G8 , 1 . 1ASML , or 1 . 1ASML preblocked by its rec - ognition peptide , washed , and placed on top of the mesenchy - mal cells . Within 2 – 3 hr the AER made adhesive contact to the mesenchymal cell layer . After 16 hr , thymidine incorporation was determined as a measure of mesenchymal cell proliferation .

Using an antibody that recognizes heparan sulfate , we found that Namalwa transfectants expressing CD44s ( not shown ) or CD44v8 – v10 ( Fig . 6A ) , did not carry detectable levels of heparan sulfate on their surfaces as measured by FACS analysis . Cells expressing CD44v3 – v10 , however , carried significant amounts of heparan sulfate ( Fig . 6A ) . These findings show that Na - malwa cells are capable of adding heparan sulfate to CD44 , and that the appropriate CD44 proteins are the only major carriers of heparan sulfate on these cells . To test the ability of each of these cell lines to bind FGFs , we used two different methods . Cells were prein - cubated with either recombinant FGF - 8 or FGF - 4 and then analyzed for FGF binding either by FACS analysis or by the resolution of total cell lysates in SDS - PAGE followed by Western blot analysis . We used the FGF - 8b splice variant , which had been shown previously to be active in initiating and promoting limb outgrowth ( Crossley et al . 1996 ; Vogel et al . 1996 ) .

The vertical line represents control maxima without pri - mary antibody ( in case of heparin and v3 ) or without FGF , but including both pri - mary and secondary antibodies . The analyses indicate that most of the heparin sulfate is linked to the presence of CD44 carrying v3 sequences . FGF binding also depends on the presence of these CD44 proteins .

Therefore , we conclude that both FGF - 4 and FGF - 8 , presumably like FGF - 2 and other heparin - binding FGFs , can bind to CD44 proteins containing v3 se - quences in the limb , most likely through heparan sulfate modifications to the sequence encoded by exon v3 . FGF - 8 and FGF - 4 can be presented to limb mesenchymal cells by CD44v3 – v10 After establishing that CD44v3 – v10 can bind the FGF proteins expressed in the AER and demonstrating that CD44 is crucial for limb bud outgrowth , we reasoned that CD44 proteins could be involved in presenting FGFs to mesenchymal cells adjacent to the AER . To address this possibility , we used the coculture assay described above using the Namalwa cells expressing different CD44 variants in place of AER tissue ( see scheme in Fig . 7 ) . We irradiated the Namalwa cells to ensure that they would not secrete cytokines that could influence limb bud mesenchymal cell proliferation . Each Namalwa cell line was added to cultures of primary limb mesenchymal cells in the presence and absence of limiting concentra - tions of either FGF - 8 ( Fig . 7 ) or FGF - 4 ( not shown ) , co - cultured for 16 hr and then removed . The mesenchymal cells were assayed for [ 3 H ] thymidine incorporation . We found that in the presence of either FGF , limb mesen - chymal cells that had been cocultured with CD44v3 – v10 - bearing Namalwa cells were stimulated to prolifer - ate fourfold more than mesenchymal cells that had been cultured with the Namalwa cell line carrying CD44v8 – v10 ( Fig . 7 , cf . column 4 with column 6 ) . Neither FGF protein at the concentration used stimulated mesenchy - mal cells above background level ( Fig . 7 , cf . columns 1 and 2 ) . The addition of either Namalwa transfectant alone also had no effect ( Fig . 7 , columns 3 , 5 ) . We infer from these data that heparan sulfate - modified CD44 variants can act as functional low - affinity receptors for the FGF proteins expressed in the AER , and that cells expressing such variants can present FGF proteins to neighboring cells . CD44v6 - and CD44v3 - specific antibodies block FGF - 8 and FGF - 4 presentation , but not binding , by CD44 If the CD44 proteins in the AER bind and present FGF proteins to adjacent mesenchymal cells , then our finding that an anti - CD44v6 antibody can block limb outgrowth could be the result of the antibody preventing FGF pro - teins from binding to CD44 . We tested this possibility by preincubating Namalwa cells expressing CD44v3 – v10 with antibodies directed against either a human CD44v6 epitope ( VFF18 ) or the amino - terminal domain of CD44 ( IM7 ) , and then incubating with either FGF - 4 or FGF - 8 . We then analyzed FGF binding using FACS or Western blot analysis . The VFF18 antibody recognizes an epitope homologous to that recognized by the rat - specific 1 . 1ASML antibody used above ( Dall et al . 1995 ) . Both FGF - 4 ( Fig . 6A ) and FGF - 8 ( Fig . 6C , lanes 3 , 4 ) still bound to CD44v3 – v10 in the presence of either antibody . This indicates that interference with limb outgrowth was not attributable to prevention of FGF binding to CD44 . Another explanation for how a CD44v6 - specific anti - body influences the limb bud is that it prevents FGF proteins that are already bound to CD44 from stimulat - ing mesenchymal cell proliferation . We tested this pos - sibility by determining whether the VFF18 antibody could inhibit limb mesenchymal cell proliferation in - Figure 7 . CD44v3 – v10 can present FGF - 8 to limb mesenchy - mal cells . Limb bud mesenchymal cells were cocultured with UV - irradiated Namalwa cells expressing either CD44v3 – v10 or CD44v8 – v10 in the presence or absence of FGF - 8 . The Nama - lwa cells were then removed and mesenchymal cell prolifera - tion was monitored by [ 3 H ] thymidine incorporation . Note that FGF - 8 only exerts a significant proliferative effect when added together with Namalwa cells transfected with CD44v3 – v10 . Antibodies used : VFF18 ( anti CD44v6 ) , rabbit polyclonal ‘‘anti - homing receptor’’ ( anti CD44v3 ) and IM7 ( anti CD44 N - term ) . Plotted cpm are the mean values of triplicate samples ± standard deviation . The absolute incorporation was highly dependent on cell density and data can only be compared within one series and relative to mesenchymal cells grown alone .

The antibody inhibited the presentation of FGFs by Namalwa cells car - rying CD44v3 – v10 ; we found that [ 3 H ] thymidine incor - poration was significantly reduced if Namalwa cells ex - pressing CD44v3 – v10 had been pretreated with VFF18 ( Fig . 7 , cf . columns 6 and 7 ) . Interestingly , an antibody to exon v3 , but not antibody IM7 , also inhibited presenta - tion ( Fig . 7 , columns 8 , 9 ) . This finding indicates that the antibody used to block limb outgrowth functions by in - terfering with growth factor presentation in the rat limb bud , and suggests that growth factor presentation is an essential function of CD44 during limb morphogenesis . Discussion Our findings indicate that a particular CD44 splice vari - ant plays a crucial role in limb development by helping to convey a proliferative signal from the AER to the mes - enchyme . This splice variant is expressed in the AER and colocalizes with members of the FGF family , which are known to stimulate limb bud outgrowth . This CD44 variant can present FGF proteins to limb mesenchymal cells stimulating their proliferation . The function of CD44 is apparently crucial for limb development , as an antibody against the variant portion of CD44 can inhibit limb bud outgrowth . The AER expresses several CD44 splice variants We have demonstrated using immunohistochemistry , in situ hybridization , Western blot analysis , and RT – PCR that particular CD44 splice variants are expressed in the AER , whereas the remainder of the limb expresses only CD44s . This is in agreement with previous RT – PCR findings with RNA from mouse limb bud ( Yu et al . 1996 ) . At least two of these CD44 variants , CD44v1 – v10 and CD44v3 – v10 , encode proteins that carry sequences for modification by heparan sulfate . Because the heparan sulfate - specific antibody does not work in Western blots , it was not possible to analyze directly heparan sulfate modifications on CD44 proteins expressed in the AER . One CD44 protein with a molecular mass of ~ 230 kD predominates according to Western blot analysis ( Fig . 1E ) . From its size and the AER RT – PCR data ( Fig . 2A ) , it is likely that this protein is a glycosylated form of CD44v3 – v10 . CD44 can mediate epithelial – mesenchymal interactions in the developing limb Interactions between epithelia and mesenchyme are cru - cial throughout the course of embryogenesis ( for review , see Birchmeier and Birchmeier 1993 ) . The developing vertebrate limb is an example of such interactions , in which the AER and the limb mesenchyme are highly dependent on each other to establish limb outgrowth , differentiation , and patterning . When the AER is re - placed by heparin beads carrying one of the FGFs pro - duced by the AER , limb bud outgrowth progresses nor - mally ( Niswander et al . 1993 ; Niswander and Martin 1993 ; Fallon et al . 1994 ; Cohn et al . 1995 ; Mahmood et al . 1995 ; Crossley et al . 1996 ; Vogel et al . 1996 ) . Soluble FGFs , even at high concentrations , cannot substitute , at least in vitro , for the AER . A low - affinity receptor carry - ing heparan sulfate expressed in the AER therefore , is likely to be necessary for presentation of these AER - de - rived growth - promoting factors . Our finding that a par - ticular CD44 variant - specific antibody applied to the AER can severely inhibit limb outgrowth , indicates that CD44 is crucial for the communication of proliferative signals from the AER to the underlying limb mesenchy - mal cells . Because antibodies against CD44v6 and CD44v3 epitopes can block the presentation of FGF pro - teins to limb bud mesenchymal cells in vitro , and as FGFs are likely to be the chief AER - derived proliferative signals in the limb , we propose that CD44 is required for the presentation of FGFs to limb bud mesenchymal cells and for the maintenance of mesenchymal cell prolifera - tion . CD44 proteins ( Wheatley et al . 1993 ; Nakamura et al . 1995 ; Yu and Toole 1997 ; C . To¨lg , P . Gruss , and H . Ponta , unpubl . ) are coexpressed with FGF - 8 ( L . Sherman , D . Wainwright , M . Ponta , and P . Herrlich , unpubl . ) by a number of other epithelia that generate instructive sig - nals to their associated mesenchymal cells , including the branchial arches and odontogenic placodes . It is pos - sible , therefore , that CD44 variants are part of a general mechanism of epithelial – mesenchymal communication , whereby growth factors expressed by an epithelial cell are carried by CD44 , then presented to an opposing mes - enchymal cell . CD44 is part of a novel growth factor presentation mechanism Previous studies have supported the notion that FGFs must bind to HSPGs on the surfaces of target cells before activating their high - affinity receptors ( for review , see Vlodavsky et al . 1996 ) . We have shown here that CD44 variant proteins can act as HSPGs on the surface of cells , and have provided the first evidence that CD44 is in - volved in a novel growth factor presentation mechanism . The novelty of this mechanism lies in the fact that the growth factor secreted by one cell ( here FGF - 8 from an AER cell ) is carried by an HSPG on this same cell ( hepa - ran sulfate - modified CD44 ) and presented to an opposing target cell ( here limb bud mesenchymal cell ; see Fig . 8 ) to stimulate its proliferation . It may suffice that FGF - 8 is presented to high - affinity receptors on only the immedi - ately adjacent mesenchymal cells . Because FGF - 8 can maintain expression of FGF - 10 in the apical mesen - chyme of early limb buds ( Ohuchi et al . 1997 ) , it is pos - sible that these cells respond by expressing FGF - 10 , which might then keep other neighboring mesenchymal cells in a proliferating state . Alternatively , the AER - de - rived signal may be passed on through gap junctions in the mesenchyme . Interestingly , FGF - 4 increases mesen - chymal gap junctional communication ( Makarenkova et al . 1997 ) . The AER and limb mesenchyme are separated from one another by a basal lamina that is deposited by the CD44 presents FGFs to limb bud mesenchymal cells GENES & DEVELOPMENT 1065 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press on November 2 , 2017 - Published by genesdev . cshlp . org Downloaded from AER , and which , according to dye exclusion assays , pre - vents passage of molecules as large as FGF proteins ( Kel - ley and Fallon 1976 ; Wilcox and Kelley 1993 ) . The basal lamina is likely to be a dynamic structure that is con - stantly renewed by the AER and proteolytically degraded by the mesenchymal cells . We propose that large CD44 splice variants and their bulky heparan sulfate side chains carrying FGF - 8 are inserted into the basal lamina ( Fig . 8 ) . As the mesenchymal cells break down the basal lamina , heparan sulfate - modified CD44 proteins would presumably protect FGF - 8 from degradation and keep it in a state suitable for presentation to either mesenchy - mal cell surface HSPGs or directly to high - affinity FGF receptors . It is possible that additional HSPGs in the limb bud could have similar functions . The only other HSPG known to be expressed in the AER is glypican ( Niu et al . 1996 ) . Glypican and related HSPGs are be - lieved to serve in presenting FGF to high - affinity recep - tors on the same cell and therefore , may be involved in signaling within the AER ( for review , see David 1993 ; Elenius and Jalkanen 1994 ; Niu et al . 1996 ; Steinfeld et al . 1996 ) . Alternatively , CD44 – FGF complexes could be shed into the basal lamina by the action of proteases . In this case , CD44 would act as a free matrix - associated HSPG . Although shedding of CD44 has been observed in many other systems ( Campanero et al . 1991 ; Bazil and Horejsi 1992 ; Camp et al . 1993 ; Gu¨nthert et al . 1996 ) , there is no evidence that free CD44 proteins are present in the basal lamina of the developing limb . An important consideration is whether mice lacking CD44 would be deficient in limb outgrowth . There have been several approaches to abrogate CD44 expression , one of which has been the disruption of the CD44 locus . CD44 null mice are viable and do not demonstrate any obvious developmental deficiencies ( see Results and F . Hilberg , unpubl . ; Schmits et al . 1997 ) . It is possible , how - ever , that embryos can compensate for the lack of CD44 with other molecules . Interestingly , antisense CD44 ex - pressed under the control of the keratin - 5 promoter in transgenic mice reduces CD44 expression in mouse skin and causes a severe skin phenotype , including a prolif - eration defect and insensitivity to exogenously added growth factors ( Kaya et al . 1997 ) . This defect is not ob - served in the CD44 null mice . The keratin - 5 promoter becomes active at E11 . 5 in the mouse embryo ( Ramirez et al . 1994 ) , a stage well after differentiation of the AER and early limb outgrowth . Both the antisense experi - ment and our antibody - blocking experiments abolish CD44 function acutely and after passage into unidirec - tional differentiation . Thus , in this situation , compensa - tion for the lack of CD44 may no longer be possible in contrast to the choices that can be made earlier in de - velopment . Preliminary observations suggest that com - pensation in CD44 − / − limbs may be attributable to an increase by one order of magnitude in mesenchymal cell sensitivity to FGF - 8 . CD44 may have additional functions in the developing limb In agreement with previous observations in mouse limb buds ( Yu et al . 1996 ) , we found that CD44s is expressed by rat limb mesenchymal cells throughout the course of early limb development . One possible role for this CD44 protein may have to do with either adhesion to or rec - ognition of hyaluronate . In the limb bud mesenchyme there is a proximal to distal gradient of hyaluronate ( Ko - sher et al . 1981 ; Singley and Solursh 1981 ; Knudson and Toole 1985 ) . The highest concentration of hyaluronate is among the cells opposing the ectoderm , except for the cells immediately beneath the AER where hyaluronate is not detectable ( Yu et al . 1996 ) . Therefore , CD44s could mediate hyaluronate adhesion within the mesenchyme or possibly hyaluronate degradation within the progress zone . Although binding to hyaluronate is up - regulated by the presence of variant exons ( Sleeman et al . 1997 ) , this binding does not appear to be relevant for the epi - thelial – mesenchymal cell interaction as the limb - block - ing CD44v6 - specific antibody does not interfere with this adhesion . Our observation that both the CD44v6 epitope and FGF - 8 are expressed throughout the AER and not just at the basal surface adjacent to the limb bud mesenchyme suggests that both proteins could function to maintain the AER itself . Growth factor presentation may be a general function of CD44 splice variants In addition to a role in presenting signals from epithelial cells to mesenchymal cells , the presentation of growth factors by CD44 may be of wider significance . Besides FGF - 2 , FGF - 4 , and FGF - 8 , heparan sulfate - modified CD44 proteins can bind a number of other heparin - bind - ing growth factors ( Tanaka et al . 1993 ; Bennett et al . Figure 8 . A model for FGF - 8 presentation by CD44 in the de - veloping limb . It is proposed that FGF - 8 binds to the heparan sulfate side chains of a CD44 variant protein containing exon v3 sequences and that both FGF - 8 and CD44 are inserted into the basal lamina as it is synthesized by AER cells . The FGF - 8 is then presented to high - affinity FGF receptors ( FGFR ) on the surface of mesenchymal cells , possibly as the mesenchymal cells de - grade the basal lamina . The binding of FGF - 8 to its high - affinity receptor subsequently leads to mesenchymal cell proliferation . Sherman et al . 1066 GENES & DEVELOPMENT Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press on November 2 , 2017 - Published by genesdev . cshlp . org Downloaded from 1995a ) . Furthermore , the presence of particular variant exon sequences in CD44 proteins can alter their affinity for various glycosaminoglycans ( Bennett et al . 1995b ; Sl - eeman et al . 1997 ) . This altered affinity could permit CD44 to associate with a variety of cytokines and other substances that alter cellular proliferation and differen - tiation . Therefore , it is possible that the ability of some CD44 proteins to bind and sequester growth - promoting substances can explain the functions of CD44s in a num - ber of normal and pathological systems . Perhaps the most compelling putative role for CD44 - mediated growth factor presentation is in the promotion of tumor cell growth and metastasis . Numerous experi - mental and clinical studies indicate that some CD44 variants play crucial roles in tumor progression ( for re - view , see Gu¨nthert 1996 ; Sherman et al . 1996 ; Naor et al . 1997 ) . Therefore , it is tantalizing to speculate that tumor cells use CD44 variants to sequester and present growth - or metastasis - promoting agents either to themselves , or , like the cells of the AER , to cells in their local microen - vironment . In support of such a common mechanism of CD44 action , the CD44v6 antibody we used to block limb bud outgrowth also interferes with immune func - tions ( Arch et al . 1992 ) and with tumor growth and me - tastasis ( Reber et al . 1990 ; Gu¨nthert et al . 1991 ; Rudy et al . 1993 ; Seiter et al . 1993 ; Sleeman et al . 1996 ) . The regulated presentation of growth factors is likely to be vital in each of these situations . Materials and methods Materials The antibodies 5G8 ( Sleeman et al . 1996 ) , IM7 ( Trowbridge et al . 1982 ) , and 1 . 1ASML ( Gu¨nthert et al . 1991 ) were affinity purified on protein G – Sepharose . VFF - 11 and VFF - 18 were obtained from Bender , Vienna , Austria . Hermes3 antibody was the kind gift of Dr . S . Jalkanen ( University of Turku , Finland ) . The CD44v3 - specific antibody was obtained from Novus Molecular , San Diego , CA ( polyclonal rabbit ‘‘anti - homing receptor’’ ) . An anti - heparan sulfate antibody was obtained from Seikagaku Corpo - ration , Tokyo , Japan . FGF - 4 and FGF - 8 antibodies were obtained from R & D systems . A polyclonal FGF - 8 antibody was kindly donated by Dr . Clive Dickson ( ICRF , London , UK ) . The peptide recognized by 1 . 1ASML ( KWFENEWQGKNPPT ) was kindly provided by Bender , Vienna . Biotinylated and HRP - conjugated secondary antibodies were from DAKO , streptavidin - conju - gated phycoerythrin from PharMingen . Cell culture Namalwa Burkitt lymphoma cells and clones expressing CD44 were a gift of Dr . Steven Pals ( Amsterdam , Netherlands ) and were cultured as described ( van der Voort et al . 1995 ) . Primary cultures of limb bud mesenchymal cells were established from the forelimb buds of E12 . 5 – E13 . 5 rat embryos . Timed pregnant BD - X rats ( 4 – 6 months of age , bred in the Institut fu¨r Genetik Animal Facility ) were killed by CO 2 inhalation . AER and ecto - derm were removed from limb buds with tungsten needles . Mesenchymal cells from the distal third of limb were disaggre - gated by gentle trituration , washed , and resuspended in DMEM / 10 % FCS . Cells were plated in 24 - well plates at a density of ~ 1 × 10 5 cells / well and maintained in a humidified 5 % CO 2 atmosphere at 37°C . Immunohistochemistry For whole - mount immunohistochemistry , BD - X rat embryos were harvested between days E10 . 5 and E14 . 5 and processed essentially as described by Wheatley et al . ( 1993 ) . As a blocking buffer we used PBS + 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 + 10 % FCS . Primary antibodies were used at 5 µg / ml . Immunostaining was detected by overnight incubations in 1 µg / ml of biotin - conjugated goat – anti - mouse IgG ( DAKO ) followed by streptavidin – peroxidase ( DAKO ) . After the final washes , tissues were developed with 3 , 3 - amino - 9 - ethyl carbazole ( Sigma ) in 50 m M sodium acetate ( pH 4 . 7 ) for appropriate periods of time . For double - labeling fluorescence immunohistochemistry , fro - zen coronal sections ( 10 µm ) of forelimb buds from E12 . 5 em - bryos were fixed in ice cold methanol for 5 min , washed in PBS , and incubated with normal goat serum ( 10 % in PBS ) at room temperature for 30 min . Sections were then incubated in 1 µg / ml of 1 . 1ASML plus 1 µg / ml of a rabbit polyclonal anti - FGF - 8 antibody in PBS for 1 hr . After washing three times for 5 min each , sections were incubated with a mixture of 1 µg / ml TRITC - and FITC - conjugated secondary antibodies for 30 min . Sections were then washed , mounted , and photographed . Back - ground controls included exclusion of both primary antibodies and exclusion of one or the other primary antibody to ensure the specificity of each secondary antibody . CD44 exon - specific RT – PCR analysis Twenty whole limbs were isolated from E12 . 5 rats in ice cold PBS . The AERs were dissected from the rest of the limb using tungsten needles and both tissues were snap - frozen . Poly ( A ) + RNA was then prepared using a Micro - FastTrack kit ( InVitro - gen ) . cDNAs were synthesized using reverse transcriptase and a CD44 primer from the 3 (cid:56) nonvariant portion of rat CD44 ( exon 19 , positions 2433 – 2459 ; primer C2A in Ko¨nig et al . 1996 ; 5 (cid:56) - GGCACTACACCCCAATCTTC - 3 (cid:56) ) , then amplified using PCR ( 25 cycles of 0 . 5 min at 95°C , 1 . 5 min at 54°C , and 1 . 0 min at 73°C , followed by incubation at 73°C for another 10 min ) using a primer from the 5 (cid:56) nonvariant portion of rat CD44 ( exon 5 , positions 621 – 640 ; C13 in Ko¨nig et al . 1996 ; 5 (cid:56) - AAGACA - TCGATGCCTCAAAC - 3 (cid:56) ) and another 3 (cid:56) primer ( exon 19 , positions 2168 – 2189 ; 5 (cid:56) - CCAAGATGATAAGCCACTCTG - 3 (cid:56) ) . From this PCR reaction , 2 µl was reamplified in the presence of individual variant exon - specific 5 (cid:56) primers ( as listed below ) and 3 (cid:56) primer 2168 – 2189 . Conditions were the same as above except that the final incubation at 73°C was extended to 10 min . PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis in 2 . 5 % agarose and visualized by ethidium bromide staining . Variant exon 5 (cid:56) primers are as follows : v1 , positions 785 – 804 ( 5 (cid:56) - GCCTCAACTGTGTACTCAAA - 3 (cid:56) ) ; v2 , positions 916 – 935 ( 5 (cid:56) - GATGACTACCCCTGAAACAC - 3 (cid:56) ) ; v3 , positions 1031 – 1050 ( 5 (cid:56) - ACGGAGTCAAATACCAACCC - 3 (cid:56) ) ; v4 , positions 1156 – 1175 ( 5 (cid:56) - TGCAACTACTCCATGGGTTT - 3 (cid:56) ) ; v5 , posi - tions 1274 – 1293 ( 5 (cid:56) - TATAGACAGAAACAGCACCA - 3 (cid:56) ) ; v6 , positions 1388 – 1407 ( 5 (cid:56) - TGGGCAGATCCTAATAGCAC - 3 (cid:56) ) ; v7 , positions 1512 – 1531 ( 5 (cid:56) - CTGCCTCAGCCCACAACAAC - 3 (cid:56) ) ; v8 , positions 1650 – 1663 ( 5 (cid:56) - CCAGTCATAGTACAACCC - TT - 3 (cid:56) ) ; v9 , positions 1757 – 1774 ( 5 (cid:56) - CAGAACTTCTCTACAT - TACC - 3 (cid:56) ) ; v10 , positions 1841 – 1860 ( 5 (cid:56) - GGTCGAAGAAGAG - GTGGAAG - 3 (cid:56) ) . All nucleotide positions correspond to the sequence of rat CD44 cDNA ( GenBank data bank , accession no . U96138 ) . Western blotting and immunoprecipitation Proteins separated on SDS – polyacrylamide gels were transferred CD44 presents FGFs to limb bud mesenchymal cells GENES & DEVELOPMENT 1067 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press on November 2 , 2017 - Published by genesdev . cshlp . org Downloaded from to Immobilon P ( Millipore ) membranes and detected using stan - dard Western blotting procedures and chemiluminescence ( ECL ; Amersham ) . For immunoprecipitations , 100 whole E12 . 5 rat limbs were lysed by trituration in 2 ml of RIPA buffer containing 2 m M PMSF . The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 14 , 000 rpm and the supernatant pretreated with 50 µl of protein A + G aga - rose beads ( Calbiochem ) at 4°C for 30 min . The beads were removed and 5 µg / ml 5G8 antibody and 80 µl of protein A + G beads were added to the supernatant . After incubation at 4°C for 60 min , the beads were washed five times with fresh RIPA buffer and boiled in sample buffer containing 10 % 2 - mercapto - ethanol for 10 min . The immunoprecipitates were resolved on a 7 . 5 % SDS - PAGE gel . CD44 proteins were detected with the 5G8 antibody using Western blotting . Limb bud mesenchymal cell coculture proliferation assays Mesenchymal cell cultures were prepared in 24 - well plates as described above . These cultures were grown to ~ 70 % conflu - ency and then starved by serum withdrawal for 24 hr before the assay . The influence of AER fragments or of Namalwa cell clones ( the latter in combination with FGFs ) on proliferation was tested . AERs were dissected from E12 . 5 rat embryos and immedi - ately incubated for 45 min in PBS alone or PBS containing 50 µg / ml of 5G8 , 1 . 1ASML , or 1 . 1ASML preincubated in a fivefold excess concentration of its recognition peptide . The AERs were washed twice and added to limb mesenchymal cell cultures . AER fragments from two limb buds were placed into each well . The AERs and mesenchymal cells were cocultured for 20 hr , after which the medium was replaced by medium containing 1 µCi / ml of [ 3 H ] thymidine ( Amersham ) . After 4 hr , the cells were washed three times with PBS , solubilized in 10 % SDS , and the incorporated radioactivity determined by scintillation count - ing . All samples were assayed in triplicate . Namalwa cells ( or clonal transfected lines expressing CD44 variants ) were harvested , washed , resuspended in PBS , and then irradiated with 2000 J / m 2 of UVC to prevent transcription , syn - thesis , and secretion of proteins that could potentially interfere with the assay . Approximately 1 × 10 5 Namalwa cells were added directly to limb mesenchymal cell cultures without or together with 50 ng / ml FGF - 8 or FGF - 4 . In dose – response curves with similar sets of primary mesenchymal cell cultures and Namalwa CD44v3 – v10 transfectants , 50 ng / ml proved to cause half - maximal stimulation . With nontransfected Nama - lwa or with mesenchymal cells alone we saw no stimulation by the addition of up to 200 ng / ml FGF . Where indicated in Figure 7 , Namalwa cells were blocked with 50 µg / ml of the specified antibody in PBS for 30 min , washed twice and then added to the mesenchymal culture together with FGF . After 16 hr cultures were washed three times to remove Namalwa cells ( which grow in suspension ) . The mesenchymal cells were pulse - labeled with 1 µCi / ml of [ 3 H ] thymidine for a further 4 hr . Incorporated ra - dioactivity was determined by scintillation counting . All cocul - ture assays were performed in triplicate . FACS analyses and FGF - binding assays For detection of cell surface expression of the CD44 splice vari - ant carrying the v3 epitope and of heparan sulfate , cells were harvested , washed twice with ice - cold PBS , and resuspended in 3 % FCS in PBS . After 15 min 1 µg / ml of primary antibody was added and the cells incubated for an additional 30 min . Cells were then washed twice and incubated with a biotinylated sec - ondary antibody for 30 min . Cells were again washed twice and incubated with streptavidin - conjugated phycoerythrin for 30 min . Finally , the cells were washed three times and fluores - cence detected using a FACS - Star Plus flow cytometer ( Becton Dickinson ) . For the detection of FGF - 4 binding , Namalwa cells and clonal lines thereof expressing specific CD44 variants were washed twice in PBS and incubated on ice in 1 % BSA , 0 . 01 % NaN 3 containing 0 . 5 µg / ml of human recombinant FGF - 4 for 60 min . Bound FGF was detected with an FGF - 4 antibody and then pro - cessed as above . To measure possible interference with FGF binding , cells were first treated with either 50 µg / ml of VFF18 or IM7 in 3 % FCS in PBS on ice for 30 min or with 1 unit of heparinase II ( Sigma ) in PBS at 25°C for 3 hr , washed twice and then assayed as above for FGF binding . For the detection of FGF8 binding , 5 × 10 6 Namalwa cells expressing CD44v3 – v10 or CD44v8 – v10 were harvested by cen - trifugation , washed three times in PBS , and then resuspended in 500 µl of ice cold PBS containing 3 % BSA , 0 . 01 % NaN 3 , and 0 . 2 µg / ml of recombinant mouse FGF - 8b . The cells were then in - cubated on ice for 60 min , washed five times with 1 ml of PBS , and lysed in 50 µl of sample buffer containing 10 % 2 - mercap - toethanol . The samples were boiled for 10 min and centrifuged at 14 , 000 rpm for 30 sec to pellet insoluble material . The su - pernatant was loaded onto 12 % ( for FGF - 8 ) or 6 % ( for CD44 ) SDS – polyacrylamide gels . FGF - 8 was detected with a FGF - 8b antibody and CD44 with Hermes3 ( recognizes all CD44 pro - teins ) by Western blot analysis . In antibody interference experi - ments , the cells were first incubated with 50 µg / ml IM7 or VFF18 for 30 min , washed three times with PBS , and analyzed for FGF - 8 binding as above . Embryo culture and experimental manipulation Stage E11 rat embryos were dissected asceptically from the uter - ine decidua . The head , heart , and lower trunk were removed . Trunk sections were placed with dorsal side facing upward into 35 - mm dishes containing 1 ml of ice cold PBS plus 1 % meth - ylcellulose . The AER was removed from the right limb of each embryo using a tungsten needle to gently peel the tissue away from the remainder of the limb . Any remaining fragments of the AER were dissected and discarded . Intact AER tissue was incu - bated at 4°C in 100 µl of PBS or PBS supplemented with 10 µg of either 1 . 1ASML , 1 . 1ASML that had been preincubated with its recognition peptide , or 5G8 for 30 min . AERs were then rinsed in PBS + methylcellulose and grafted back onto the op - erated limb by pushing the treated AER tissue into the wound where the mesenchyme was exposed . After 2 hr , medium was added to the embryo cultures , which were subsequently main - tained in a humidified 5 % CO 2 atmosphere at 37°C . The me - dium used was a modification of that described by Ochiya et al . ( 1995 ) using 1 % methylcellulose and no amphotericin B . After 4 days , limb buds were measured under a stereoscopic micro - scope .
