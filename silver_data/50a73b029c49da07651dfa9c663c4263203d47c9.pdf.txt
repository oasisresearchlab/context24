An allosteric kinase inhibitor binds the p21 - activated kinase autoregulatory domain covalently Julien Viaud and Jeffrey R . Peterson Fox Chase Cancer Center , Philadelphia , Pennsylvania Abstract Kinases are important therapeutic targets in oncology due to their frequent deregulation in cancer . Typical ATP - competitive kinase inhibitors , however , also inhibit off - target kinases that could lead to drug toxicity . Allosteric inhibitors represent an alternative approach to achieve greater kinase selectivity , although examples of such com - pounds are few . Here , we elucidate the mechanism of action of IPA - 3 , an allosteric inhibitor of Pak kinase activa - tion . We show that IPA - 3 binds covalently to the Pak1 reg - ulatory domain and prevents binding to the upstream activator Cdc42 . Preactivated Pak1 , however , is neither inhibited nor bound significantly by IPA - 3 , demonstrating exquisite conformational specificity of the interaction . Using radiolabeled IPA - 3 , we show that inhibitor binding is specific and reversible in reducing environments . Finally , cell experiments using IPA - 3 implicate Pak1 in phorbol - ester – stimulated membrane ruffling .

[ Mol Cancer Ther 2009 ; 8 ( 9 ) : OF1 – 7 ] Introduction Protein kinases have attracted much attention as therapeutic targets in oncology due to their frequent dysregulation in cancer and their tractability to small - molecule inhibition . A significant challenge in the development of kinase inhibi - tors is achieving kinase selectivity , due to the evolutionary conservation of the ATP - binding pocket among kinases . An attractive alternative approach would be allosteric inhibi - tion by compounds binding at distant , less conserved sites . Kinases frequently contain regulatory domains ( RD ) that regulate kinase location and / or catalytic activity , and these domains may offer alternative targets for allosteric kinase inhibition . IPA - 3 is a non ATP - competitive , allosteric inhibitor of p21 - activated kinase 1 ( Pak1 ; ref . 1 ) , a cytoplasmic serine / threonine kinase whose hyperactivity has been closely linked to tumorigenesis ( reviewed in refs . 2 – 5 ) . Pak1 con - tains an NH 2 - terminal RD that in the inactive , homodimeric state binds and inhibits the catalytic activity of the COOH - terminal kinase domain of its partner and vice versa ( Fig . 1A ) . Binding of the p21 GTP binding proteins Rac or Cdc42 to the RD displaces the RD from the catalytic do - main , dissociating the dimer , and leading to kinase activa - tion ( 6 , 7 ) . IPA - 3 was identified in an in vitro screen for compounds that inhibit Pak1 activation by Cdc42 ( 1 ) but the mechanism by which IPA - 3 inhibits Pak1 activation is unknown . Nevertheless , a variety of studies have begun to use this compound to investigate Pak functions in cells ( 1 , 8 – 10 ) . Here , using a multidisciplinary approach includ - ing fluorescence spectroscopy , affinity precipitation , kinase assays , and binding assays using radiolabeled IPA - 3 , we show that IPA - 3 inhibits Pak1 activation in part by binding covalently to the RD of Pak1 . This work illustrates a novel approach to kinase inhibition that provides significant target selectivity and implicates Pak1 as a critical down - stream effector of protein kinase C in actin cytoskeletal rearrangements . Materials and Methods Materials Cdc42 - GTP γ S , full - length Pak1 , activated Pak2 , GST - Rac1 , GST - HR1 ( from PRK1 ) , myelin basic protein ( MBP ) , and glu - tathione S - transferase ( GST ) - mini - N - WASP were prepared as described ( 11 – 14 ) . GST - Pak1 kinase domain K299R ( amino acids 248 – 545 ) and GST - RD ( amino acids 67 – 150 ) were gen - erated by PCR from templates provided by J . Chernoff ( Fox Chase Cancer Center , Philadelphia , PA ) and were cloned into pGEX - 6P1 and purified from Escherichia coli . Plasmids encod - ing HA - tagged human Pak1 ( in pJ3 ) and myc - tagged Cdc42 ( in pCMV6M ) were generously provided by J . Chernoff . Fluorescence Spectroscopy Emission spectra ( excitation , 280 nm ) were recorded with a Cary Eclipse ( Varian ) in Kinase buffer [ 50 mmol / L HEPES ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 12 . 5 mmol / L NaCl , 0 . 625 mmol / L MgCl 2 , and 0 . 625 mmol / L MnCl 2 ] at 22°C . A 0 . 5 μ mol / L solution of each protein was titrated in parallel with IPA - 3 or DMSO ( solvent control ) , and after 5 min of incubation , tryptophan emission was monitored at 340 nm . Fluorescence changes observed in DMSO only titrations were subtracted to re - move solvent effects on tryptophan fluorescence .

MCT - 09 - 0102 Kinase Assay Pak1 ( 150 nmol / L final ) was preincubated with MBP ( 8 . 3 μ mol / L ) , indicated proteins , and IPA - 3 or DMSO in Ki - nase buffer for 20 min at 4°C . Cdc42 - GTP γ S ( 3 . 2 μ mol / L ) was then added , and the reaction was pre - equilibrated 10 min at 30°C . Kinase reactions were started by the addition of ATP ( to 30 μ mol / L ) containing [ 32 P ] ATP and were incubated 10 min and analyzed by SDS - PAGE and autoradiography . Pak1 - Cdc42 Binding Assays GST ( 10 μ g ) , GST - RD ( 20 μ g ) , or GST - mini N - Wasp bound to Glutathione Sepharose 4B were incubated with IPA - 3 or PIR3 . 5 for 10 min at room temperature and then 30 min on ice in 100 μ L Binding buffer [ 50 mmol / L Hepes ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 100 mmol / L NaCl , 10 mmol / L MgCl2 , 1 % Nonidet P40 ] . Cdc42 - GTP γ S ( 5 μ g ) was added for 30 min . Beads were washed with Binding buffer and resuspended in sample buffer for SDS - PAGE and Western blotting with anti - Cdc42 antibodies ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) . For cell studies , HEK293 cells were transfected with myc - Cdc42 or HA - Pak1 using Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitro - gen ) , and the following day , serum was withdrawn from the culture medium . Forty - eight hours after transfection , cells were treated with DMSO ( solvent control ) or 50 μ mol / L IPA - 3 for 10 min before addition of 250 ng / mL phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate for 15 min . Cells were lysed in cold lysis buffer [ 50 mmol / L Tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 100 mmol / L NaCl , 1 mmol / L EDTA , 5 mmol / L MgCl 2 , 10 % glycerol , 1 % Nonidet P - 40 , 50 mmol / L NaF , 5 mmol / L Na3VO4 ] , and clarified lysates were immunopre - cipitated with anti - myc ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) or anti - HA ( Covance ) antibodies and analyzed by SDS - PAGE / Western blotting for myc or HA . [ 14 C ] - IPA - 3 14 C - radiolabeled IPA - 3 ( 2 , 837 ± 85 cpm / nmol ) was syn - thesized essentially as previously described ( 1 ) except using 8 - [ 14 C ] – labeled 2 - naphthol ( Sigma ) as a precursor . Details and product characterization are available as Supplementa - ry Data . For autoradiographic detection of [ 14 C ] - IPA - 3 , dried SDS - PAGE gels were exposed to BioMax MS film ( Kodak ) using a BioMax TranScreen - LE ( Kodak ) . Exposure times were typically 7 d . [ 14 C ] - IPA - 3 Binding Assay Pak1 or other proteins were incubated with [ 14 C ] - IPA - 3 for 1 h ( or as indicated ) in Kinase buffer at 30°C . Covalently bound [ 14 C ] - IPA - 3 was separated from free [ 14 C ] - IPA - 3 by precipitation using 10 volumes of acetone and incubation for 1 h at 30°C . Precipitates were recovered by centrifuga - tion , solubilized in 2 % SDS , and analyzed by scintillation counting ( Beckman LS6000SC ) . Efficiency of protein precipitation was > 90 % as assessed by silver staining of SDS - PAGE gels of precipitated protein from a parallel ex - periment using unlabeled IPA - 3 . Covalent binding of [ 14 C ] - IPA - 3 was also assessed by their comigration in nonreducing SDS - PAGE . For Fig . 4B , 1 . 1 μ g recombinant Pak1 were first added to serial dilutions of a high - speed supernatant of Xenopus egg cytoplasmic ex - tract ( 7 . 2 mg / mL ) prepared as described but without DTT ( 12 ) , and then [ 14 C ] - IPA - 3 was added to 20 μ mol / L . After a 1 h incubation at 30°C , samples were analyzed as above . For Fig . 3D , 15 μ mol / L [ 14 C ] - IPA - 3 was incubated with pure Pak1 for 1 h at 30°C in Kinase buffer and then partially proteolyzed for the indicated times on ice with 2 . 2 μ g / mL chymotrypsin to generate chymotrypin - resistant core fragments ( 15 ) and analyzed by 15 % SDS - PAGE and autoradiography .

MCT - 09 - 0102 Membrane Ruffling Assay BS - C - 1 cells were pretreated for 10 min with either DMSO , control compound PIR3 . 5 , or IPA - 3 ( 50 μ mol / L ) . Cells were then stimulated for 15 min with 250 ng / mL PMA in culture medium and fixed in PBS containing 4 % formaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature . For the washout experiment , cells were treated for 10 min with 50 μ mol / L IPA - 3 and then washed into media without IPA - 3 but containing 500 μ mol / L cycloheximide for 1 h before stimulation with PMA and fixation as above . After permea - bilization , filamentous actin was stained with Alexa 488 – phalloidin and 4 ′ , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( Molecular Probes ) and quantified as described ( 16 ) . For Pak1 localiza - tion , BS - C - 1 cells were transfected with HA - Pak1 using Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen ) . Transfected Pak1 was lo - calized in PMA - stimulated cells by indirect immunofluores - cence using an anti - HA antibody ( Covance ) . Results IPA - 3 Binds the RD of Pak1 IPA - 3 ( Fig . 1B ) inhibits the activation of Pak1 by small GTPases but does not inhibit the catalytic activity of pre - activated Pak1 ( 1 ) . These observations suggest that IPA - 3 might perturb conformational changes that normally ac - company Pak1 activation . To determine whether IPA - 3 interacts with the Pak1 RD , we titrated a solution of full - length Pak1 , truncated Pak1 fragments or control proteins with IPA - 3 , and monitored changes in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence . Three tryptophan residues are located within the kinase domain and one within the RD . Saturable bind - ing of IPA - 3 to full - length Pak1 was observed with an ap - parent dissociation constant of 1 . 92 ± 0 . 2 μ mol / L , consistent with the reported IC 50 of 2 . 5 μ mol / L ( Fig . 1C ) . IPA - 3 bound the isolated RD with an even higher apparent affinity ( 0 . 1 ± 0 . 01 μ mol / L ) , whereas the kinase domain showed a weaker interaction . As negative controls , GST alone and free tryptophan showed only weak perturbation of fluorescence . These observations indicate a direct binding of IPA - 3 to the RD of Pak1 . In addition , the higher apparent affinity for the isolated RD compared with full - length Pak1 suggests that IPA - 3 may bind to a conformation of the RD distinct from that found in autoinhibited Pak1 . Next , we reasoned that if IPA - 3 binds the Pak1 RD , then excess RD might titrate IPA - 3 away from full - length Pak1 in vitro , protecting full - length Pak1 from inhibition by IPA - 3 . To test this , Pak1 and MBP were incubated with or without GST - RD or GST and then IPA - 3 was added ( or not ) . Cdc42 - GTP γ S ( hereafter simply called “ Cdc42 ” ) and [ 32 P ] - ATP were added to initiate the kinase assay . As expected , Cdc42 pro - moted Pak activation leading to higher levels of MBP phos - phorylation , and this increased kinase activity was inhibited by IPA - 3 ( Fig . 1D ; compare autoradiogram lanes 1 – 3 ) . Inclu - sion of GST - RD protected Pak1 from IPA - 3 – mediated inhibi - tion in a dose - dependent manner ( lanes 4 – 5 ) , whereas GST alone did not ( lanes 8 – 9 ) . This finding is particularly striking because GST - RD on its own inhibits Pak1 activation ( com - pare lanes 6 and 7 with lane 2 ) by both sequestering Cdc42 and by directly inhibiting Pak1 ( 15 ) . Together , our results show direct binding of IPA - 3 to the RD of Pak1 . IPA - 3 Binding to the RD Inhibits Cdc42 Binding Binding of small GTPases to the Pak1 RD initiates confor - mational changes leading to Pak1 activation . Because IPA - 3 also binds to the RD , we tested whether IPA - 3 inhibits Cdc42 - RD binding . GST - RD immobilized on beads was used to pre - cipitate soluble Cdc42 in the presence or absence of IPA - 3 . IPA - 3 inhibited the interaction of Cdc42 with the Pak1 RD in a dose - dependent manner ( Fig . 2A , lanes 3 – 5 ) . As expected , the structurally related but inactive compound PIR3 . 5 had no effect ( lanes 6 – 8 ) . Moreover , IPA - 3 has no effect on the binding of Cdc42 to the homologous RD from N - WASP ( lanes 9 – 10 ) , which shares 30 % sequence identity to the RD of Pak1 . Thus , IPA - 3 selectively prevents Pak1 activation , in part , by preventing its interaction with small GTPase activators . To confirm that IPA - 3 could disrupt binding of Cdc42 to full - length Pak1 in the cellular context , we transfected HEK293 cells with Cdc42 and Pak and monitored their as - sociation by coimmunoprecipitation in the presence or ab - sence of IPA - 3 ( Fig . 2B ) . Treatment with IPA - 3 inhibited the binding of Pak1 to Cdc42 ( compare lanes 2 and 3 ) , sup - porting the in vitro results . IPA - 3 Binds Pak1 Covalently IPA - 3 contains a disulfide bond , suggesting that it might act through covalent redox modification of Pak1 . We previ - ously showed that IPA - 3 does not form mixed disulfides Figure 2 . IPA - 3 inhibits Pak1 - Cdc42 binding . A , IPA - 3 inhibits Cdc42 binding to the Pak1 RD . Bead - bound GST - RD was incubated with soluble Cdc42 - GTP γ S in the absence ( lanes 1 – 2 ) or presence ( lanes 3 – 5 ) of IPA - 3 or the control compound PIR3 . 5 ( lanes 6 – 8 ) . RD - bound Cdc42 was de - tected by anti - Cdc42 Western blotting . As a control , binding of Cdc42 to GST - mini N - WASP was also tested ( lanes 9 and 10 ) . B , IPA - 3 inhibits binding of Cdc42 to full - length Pak1 in cells . HEK293 cells , transfected as indicated with myc - Cdc42 and / or HA - Pak1 , were treated with solvent or 50 μ mol / L IPA - 3 before stimulation with 250 ng / mL phorbol myristate ac - etate for 15 min . Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti - myc or anti - HA antibodies and the precipitates ( top ) and samples of the total ly - sates ( bottom ) were analyzed by Western blot with anti - myc and anti - HA .

MCT - 09 - 0102 with surface - exposed cysteine residues of Pak1 ( 1 ) . To test whether IPA - 3 might covalently modify Pak1 at other sites , we synthesized IPA - 3 using 8 - [ 14 C ] – labeled 2 - naphthol as a precursor to introduce the radiolabel into both naphthol ring systems ( see Fig . 1B ) . Increasing amounts of recombi - nant Pak1 were incubated with [ 14 C ] - IPA - 3 under condi - tions in which IPA - 3 inhibits Pak1 activation by > 90 % and then Pak1 protein was acetone precipitated under denatur - ing conditions . Whereas [ 14 C ] - IPA - 3 alone was freely soluble in acetone ( data not shown ) , a small fraction of [ 14 C ] - IPA - 3 precipitated in a Pak - dependent manner with a stoichiome - try of ∼ 2 . 5 mol IPA - 3 / mol Pak1 ( Fig . 3A , ▪ ) . Quantitatively similar binding was observed to the truncated constructs comprising the RD and kinase domains . No binding was detected to GST alone , however . Notably , the Pak1 RD lacks any cysteine residues , indicating that IPA - 3 binding to this domain does not occur through the formation of a mixed disulfide . Time - dependent inhibition is a hallmark of cova - lent inhibitors , and kinetic experiments using this assay re - vealed slow binding of IPA - 3 to Pak1 with a saturating stoichiometry of 2 . 6 ± 0 . 5 mol IPA - 3 / mol Pak1 ( Fig . 3B ) . To confirm that IPA - 3 binding is covalent , Pak1 or GST were incubated with [ 14 C ] - IPA - 3 and then analyzed by non - reducing SDS - PAGE and autoradiography . Comigration of the radiolabel with Pak1 confirmed covalent binding of IPA - 3 to Pak1 , whereas no binding of [ 14 C ] - IPA - 3 to GST was detected ( Fig . 3C , top ) . [ 14 C ] - IPA - 3 also bound fragments of Pak1 corresponding to the RD and a catalytically dead form of the kinase domain , although with a higher apparent affinity to the RD ( bottom ) . Figure 3 .

Binding data were fit to the equation IPA - 3 bound = MaxBound × Time / ( HalfBound + Time ) , where MaxBound corresponds to the maximum IPA - 3 bound to Pak1 , Time corresponds to the incubation time , and HalfBound to the time when half of total Pak is IPA - 3 - bound .

MCT - 09 - 0102 To determine where IPA - 3 bound in the context of the na - tive homodimer , full - length Pak1 was incubated with [ 14 C ] - IPA - 3 followed by limited proteolysis with chymotrypsin , which produces protease - resistant fragments corresponding to the core of the regulatory and kinase domains ( 15 ) . SDS - PAGE and autoradiography of the proteolytic digests showed radioactivity associated with both core domains ( Fig . 3D ) . Phosphorimager analysis of the proteolytic di - gests showed ∼ 37 % of the Pak1 - bound IPA - 3 was associat - ed with the stable catalytic domain ( Fig . 3D , bottom ) , implying that the remaining radioactivity is present in low molecular weight peptide fragments that would include the RD . Thus , although IPA - 3 - RD binding prevents Cdc42 - RD binding , we cannot rule out additional affects mediated by IPA - 3 bound to the kinase domain . Although if impor - tant for Pak inhibition , this binding site must only seem on - ly transiently during activation because catalytically active Pak1 is not inhibited by IPA - 3 ( 1 ) . We predicted that , if covalent , binding of IPA - 3 to Pak1 should be temperature - dependent and irreversible under our in vitro conditions . To test this prediction , we preincu - bated [ 14 C ] - IPA - 3 with Pak1 and MBP at 4° , 15° , or 30°C and then added excess RD to sequester residual free IPA - 3 . The temperature of all reactions was then shifted to 30°C , Cdc42 - GTP γ S and [ 32 P ] ATP were added , and Pak1 kinase activity was measured . Pak1 preincubated with IPA - 3 at 4°C before RD addition showed robust kinase activity due to dose - dependent sequestration of IPA - 3 by RD ( Fig . 3E , compare lane 3 with lanes 4 – 5 ) . Pak1 kinase activity was pro - gressively inhibited after preincubation at 15°C or 30°C be - fore RD addition ( lanes 6 - 9 ) . This result shows that inhibition by IPA - 3 occurs in a temperature - dependent and irreversible manner during the preincubation step . IPA - 3 Binding to Pak1 Is Selective The low stoichiometry and saturability of IPA - 3 binding to Pak1 and the lack of binding to GST suggested that the binding , although covalent , was highly specific . Indeed , IPA - 3 exhibits significant kinase selectivity and also does not inhibit the catalytic activity of Pak1 that has been pre - activated by Cdc42 ( 1 ) . We therefore assessed the ability of IPA - 3 to bind to Pak1 after preactivation by Cdc42 . Whereas inactive Pak1 bound IPA - 3 robustly , binding of IPA - 3 to pre - activated Pak1 was substantially reduced ( Fig . 4A , compare lanes 1 and 2 ) , consistent with the inability of IPA - 3 to inhibit preactivated Pak1 . We also tested the ability of IPA - 3 to bind covalently to a variety of other proteins . IPA - 3 showed selectivity for inac - tive Pak1 or RD and did not bind significantly to other tested proteins including bovine serum albumin ( Fig . 4A ) . To deter - mine the selectivity of IPA - 3 for Pak1 in a more complex pro - tein mixture , recombinant Pak1 was added to serial dilutions of a cytosolic extract of Xenopus laevis eggs and [ 14 C ] - IPA - 3 was added , and the reaction was incubated for 1 hour . Mix - tures were then analyzed by nonreducing SDS - PAGE and Phosphorimager analysis . In the most concentrated sample , Pak1 represented only 0 . 76 % of total protein , yet IPA - 3 bind - ing to Pak1 was unaffected by the presence of excess Xenopus proteins and individual radiolabeled proteins other than Pak1 were not observed ( Fig . 4B ) . Because of limitations in the sensitivity of detection of [ 14 C ] - IPA - 3 , we cannot con - clude that proteins other than Pak1 do not bind IPA - 3 . Nor would we expect to detect binding of IPA - 3 to the low con - centration of endogenous Pak1 protein . Nevertheless , the ro - bust and specific labeling of added recombinant Pak1 in this complex mixture supports a selective binding of IPA - 3 to Pak1 . We thus conclude that the selective kinase inhibitory Figure 4 . IPA - 3 binding is highly selective for inactive Pak1 . A , IPA - 3 binds inactive Pak1 and the isolated RD but not preactivated Pak1 nor other control proteins . [ 14 C ] - IPA - 3 ( 10 μ mol / L ) was incubated with inactive Pak1 , Pak1 preactivated by Cdc42 , or the indicated recombinant proteins .

Parallel samples using unlabeled IPA - 3 were ana - lyzed by Coomassie staining ( top ) . C , IPA - 3 binding is reversed by DTT .

MCT - 09 - 0102 profile of IPA - 3 can be explained by a specific and conforma - tion - dependent binding of IPA - 3 to Pak1 . IPA - 3 Binding and Inhibitory Activity Is Reversed by Reducing Environments In vitro and In vivo The disulfide bond of IPA - 3 is critical for inhibition of Pak1 , and in vitro reduction by the reducing agent DTT abolishes Pak1 inhibition by IPA - 3 ( 1 ) . We therefore tested whether IPA - 3 bound covalently to Pak1 would be released by DTT treatment . Pak1 was incubated with [ 14 C ] - IPA - 3 followed by a range of DTT concentrations . Quantitation of Pak1 - bound [ 14 C ] - IPA - 3 from acetone precipitates revealed that DTT treat - ment released IPA - 3 in a dose - dependent manner ( Fig . 4C ) . The cell cytoplasm is a reducing environment , which might result in reduction and inactivation of IPA - 3 in cells . Nevertheless , IPA - 3 treatment of cells inhibits Pak1 activa - tion ( 1 ) , most likely because of the large reservoir of freely ex - changing IPA - 3 present in the oxidizing environment of the cell culture medium . We therefore predicted that IPA - 3 inhi - bition in cells might be reversed by the cellular redox envi - ronment on removal of IPA - 3 from the culture medium . Pak1 activity is closely linked to dorsal membrane ruffling ( 17 , 18 ) and stimulation of cells by the protein kinase C ago - nist PMA , activates Pak isoforms ( 19 ) , and produces actin - rich ruffles containing Pak1 ( Fig . 5A ) . PMA - induced ruffling is blocked by inhibitors of Rho GTPase signaling ( 16 ) consis - tent with a role for Pak1 . IPA - 3 , but not the control compound PIR3 . 5 , inhibited PMA - stimulated ruffling ( Fig . 5B and C ) . Removal of IPA - 3 from the culture media and addition of cy - clohexamide to block new protein synthesis restored the abil - ity of PMA - stimulated cells to ruffle ( Fig . 5B and C ) . We therefore conclude that the effect of IPA - 3 is reversible in live cells , most likely through reductive release of IPA - 3 . Discussion The present study has elucidated a novel mechanism for ki - nase inhibition by IPA - 3 , a non - ATP competitive inhibitor of Pak1 activation . The results have revealed three new and important mechanistic details of the mechanism of action of IPA - 3 . First , we show that IPA - 3 binds Pak1 covalently , in a time - and temperature - dependent manner . Intriguingly , this interaction is highly selective , saturable , and of low stoi - chiometry , although the chemical basis for this selectivity Figure 5 . IPA - 3 reversibly inhibits PMA - induced membrane ruffling in cells . A , ruffles contain Pak1 . B - SC - 1 cells were transfected with HA - Pak1 and stimulated with 250 ng / mL PMA for 10 min . Fixed cells were stained with Alexa488 - phalloidin and anti - HA antibodies for immunoflourescence . B , re - versible inhibition of ruffling by IPA - 3 . Cells were pretreated with 50 μ mol / L control compound PIR3 . 5 , IPA - 3 , or solvent for 10 min and then stim - ulated ( or not ) with PMA for 15 min . Right , cells were treated with IPA - 3 for 10 min and then washed into media without IPA - 3 but containing 0 . 5 mmol / L cyclohexamide for 1 h before stimula - tion with PMA as above . Fixed cells were stained with Alexa488 - phalloidin . C , quantitation of repli - cate experiments of B .

MCT - 09 - 0102 and the precise nature of the adducts are , as yet , unknown . Second , we show that by binding Pak1 , IPA - 3 prevents binding of the Pak1 activator Cdc42 , thus providing a mech - anistic explanation for how IPA - 3 inhibits Pak1 activation . Third , we show that IPA - 3 binds directly to the Pak1 auto - RD . Inhibition of kinases by selective covalent modification of active site residues is now well established ( 20 – 23 ) . The findings with IPA - 3 suggest that covalent modification of sites outside of the active site might offer additional oppor - tunities for target inhibition . Indeed , covalent inhibitors of Polo - like kinase have been identified that target the func - tionally important Polo box domain rather than the kinase domain ( 24 ) . Other examples of covalent allosteric inhibitors targeting nonkinase enzymes have also been described ( 25 , 26 ) . Kinase inhibitors acting by this mechanism may ex - hibit greater kinase selectivity and improved pharmacologic efficacy ( 27 ) . Indeed , covalent posttranslational modifica - tions occurring outside of active sites such as phosphoryla - tion , ubiquitinylation , and SUMOylation are important regulators of enzyme activity in biological systems . This suggests that small - molecule inhibitors for other enzymes might be found that exploit the regulatory power of cova - lent modification distal to the active site . Finally , our findings implicate Pak1 in the formation of ac - tin - rich ruffles stimulated by PMA . Pak1 localized to these structures and ruffling was reversibly inhibited by IPA - 3 . Other proteins previously localized to dorsal membrane ruf - fles include cortactin and Arp2 / 3 complex , two known Pak1 substrates ( 28 ) . Although the biological function of these structures and the signaling pathways that regulate them re - main to be determined , they may play a role in of receptor internalization and / or extracellular matrix degradation ( 29 ) . The results presented here suggest that Pak1 plays a central role in coordinating the underlying cytoskeletal organization .
