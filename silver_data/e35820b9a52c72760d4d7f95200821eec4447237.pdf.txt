On the other hand , basic research in the life sciences is long - term , and many drug - discovery biotechnology ( biotech ) startups and companies normally face the “valley of death” as the negative profit period . Therefore , this paper plans to understand the underlying probabilistically reproducible characteristics of the Research and Development ( R & D ) investment of the current successful and survival biotech companies with negative profit and excess debt in the FY2008 financial crisis . The research aims to search for future guidelines by looking back on the characteristics of the R & D investment at a similar past time of the current surviving and outstanding biotech companies using the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s Electronic Data Gathering , Analysis , and Retrieval system database . Keywords—biotech companies , the valley of death , research and development investment , financial crisis , real options I . I NTRODUCTION March ( 1991 ) [ 1 ] , Teece et al . ( 2007 ) [ 2 ] , and Kerr et al . ( 2014 ) [ 3 ] discussed , respectively , “exploration and exploitation , ” “dynamic capability , ” and “social experimentation of entrepreneurship . ” One of the common keywords behind these concepts can be the “Valley of Death” as the entrance cost of radical innovation . Alternatively , its consequent ubiquitous structure in competitiveness asymmetry is Pareto ( cf . Zipf , if discrete ) distribution consisting of a head part—so - called star firms—and a long - tail part—non - star firms—in the performance within innovation clusters . Ehlers ( 1998 ) [ 4 ] and Auerswald & Branscomb ( 2003 ) [ 5 ] defined the “Valley of Death” as a negative profit chasm between basic science and commercialization . As one of the science - push industries , the biotechnology ( biotech ) business depends upon startups and small companies . They have comparative advantages in speed , cost , and flexibility over big pharmaceutical firms ( big pharma ) at drug discovery between the basic research at universities and the clinical tests and manufacturing at big pharma . However , almost biotech startups and companies are normally facing the Valley of Death from constraining of limited resources , as biologists Kampers et al . ( 2021 ) [ 7 ] , development sociologist Kenney ( 1986 ) [ 8 ] , and innovation management scholar Pisano ( 2006 ) [ 9 ] have already indicated the deep - tech ( i . e . , deep and long - term negative profit innovation type based on basic science ) characteristics of the business of life sciences . Thus , this study has the following research questions : ( i ) How could loss - making biotech companies survive a financial crisis ? ( ii ) What was the research and development ( R & D ) investment method for excess debt biotech companies in the financial crisis ? ( iii ) Among the current star - biotech companies , what were the characteristics of the loss - making firms’ R & D investment in the financial crisis ? This study defines biotech startups and companies as real option portfolios with the potential of investing in R & D as an exercise price for the commercialization opportunities of life science as the underlying asset ( Smith & Smith , 2019 ) [ 12 ] . As a research method , of the 365 companies included in the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index ( NBI ) as of August 2022 , 363 companies , excluding two big pharma AstraZeneca and Sanofi , were targeted . Furthermore , we focused on 58 cohort companies belonging to NBI in FY2008 and FY2021 . First , we classified the 58 companies into ten profitable and 48 non - profitable companies according to their net income sign as of FY2008 . Next , according to their total stockholders’ equity ( TSE ) , the 48 loss - making companies were classified into 36 positive TSE ( excess asset ) companies and twelve negative TSE ( excess liability or debt ) companies . This study obtained data from the United States ( US ) Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) ’s Electronic Data Gathering , Analysis , and Retrieval system ( EDGAR ) database . The study’s objective is to search for future guidelines and then to look back on the characteristics of the R & D investment of negative profit and particularly excess debt biotech companies at the time of the financial crisis within the current surviving and outstanding companies . After the introduction , this paper consists of a literature review , cohort firms in the Pareto distribution , characteristics of loss - making and excess debt companies , real options analysis , Bayesian analysis , and a conclusion . II . L ITERATURE R EVIEW A . Advantages of Biotech Startups Biotech startups are major drivers of drug discovery between universities and big pharma since biotech startups are superior in speed , cost , and flexibility for drug discovery rather than big pharma . For instance , Nobel laureate Stanford University Professor late Kornberg ( 1995 ) [ 13 ] introduced a case of science - push innovation as the drug discovery of biotech startup DNAX between the university basic - research and clinical test at big pharma Schering - Plough ( present Merck ) . Zucker et al . ( 1996 ) [ 14 ] indicated the critical function of star scientists and main research universities for technology transfer from university to industry . Moreover , 20 2 3 I EEE I n t e r n a ti on a l C on f e r e n ce on E ng i n ee r i ng , T ec hno l ogy a nd I nnov a ti on ( I C E / I T M C ) | 979 - 8 - 3503 - 1517 - 2 / 23 / $ 31 . 00 © 2023 I EEE | DO I : 10 . 1109 / I C E / I T M C 58018 . 2023 . 10332383 Authorized licensed use limited to the terms of the applicable license agreement with IEEE . Restrictions apply . from a broader system perspective , Zucker et al . ( 2002 ) [ 15 ] analyzed biotech startups’ supremacy in commercializing universities’ basic research findings . Furthermore , from a regional perspective , Zucker et al . ( 2007 ) [ 16 ] examined a mechanism of entrepreneurial cluster formation in the biotech industry . B . Valley of Death However , the drug development process characterizes a long - term period , a huge investment , and a very limited success rate . For instance , on average , it takes 12 years , costs 2 . 6 billion ( Bn ) US dollars ( USD ) ( PhRMA , 2021 ) [ 17 ] , and has a one - ten thousandth probability of success from laboratory bench compounds to approved drugs on the market ( Monitor Deloitte , 2020 ) [ 18 ] . Therefore , it is difficult for small biotech startups to carry out the whole drug development process except for orphan drugs . Then they usually out - license the patents of their drug candidates to big pharma around phase two clinical tests . Nevertheless , almost biotech companies face the Valley of Death because of resource constraints . As aforementioned , Ehlers ( 1998 ) [ 4 ] defined the Valley of Death and expected small startups to bridge this applied research gap between federally - funded basic research and industry - funded product development from a policy - making perspective for the technological industry . Branscomb & Auerswald ( 2001 ) [ 6 ] proposed a risk hedge between technical and market risks from an academic perspective . Furthermore , Auerswald & Branscomb ( 2003 ) [ 5 ] defined Darwinian Seas as the screening stage after crossing the Valley of Death . In bridging the gap , policymakers have created and institutionalized technology transfer schemes , for instance , such as the Bayh - Dole Act of 1980 , the Advanced Technology Program ( ATP ) , the Small Business Innovation Research ( SBIR ) , and the Small Business Technology Transfer ( STTR ) . On the other hand , regarding the biotech industry , a sociological scholar , Kenney ( 1986 ) [ 8 ] , provided a picture of the growth of the biotech industry based on a triangle among universities , big pharma , and startups . He pinpointed the main players as entrepreneurial professors and negative profit biotech startups . Management scholar Pisano ( 2006 ) [ 9 ] raised the following question : Even with ten to twenty years of long lead time for drug development , was the US biotech industry’s profitability insufficient ? Why had the huge cash inflow from federal funds , venture capitalists , and big pharma alliances not realized as profits ? Lazonick & Tulum ( 2011 ) [ 19 ] answered this puzzle by indicating that the stock - market investors and the executives of biotech startups and big pharma just earned “bubble” profits before real drug development . However , we have already confirmed the average positive yield of the whole biotech industry ( in the listed company dataset ) 2008 . Further , Zucker et al . — ( 1996 ) [ 14 ] , ( 2002 ) [ 15 ] , and ( 2007 ) [ 16 ] —indicated that the close relationship of star scientists at top universities with pioneering biotech startups showed a strong breakthrough effect of knowledge capital on economic performance . Moreover , it means maintaining the synergy between knowledge and business performance through “trial and error , ” serendipitous learning under uncertainty . As a result , there is an asymmetry distribution of radical innovation competitiveness between the number of players and the academic and financial achievements shown as a Pareto distribution . A few elite superstars share most of the performance in general competitive structure as sports , arts , academia , and business . Therefore , even if the average income is positive profits , there is necessary for a survival strategy of radical innovation in a cluster with risk diversification by high birth rate and high death rate . It ubiquitously depends based on Pareto distribution with a small number of the higher performance elite head part and the many numbers of the lower performance promising next - generation long - tail details . C . Cost of Social Experimentation by “High Brith Rate and High Death Rate” Star biotech companies—Gilead Science , Exelixis , and former “Genentech”—show successful results of the high birth rate and high death rate strategy for survival in the “San Francisco Bay” area as the example of the head part of start biotech companies in Pareto distribution described above . As aforementioned , this universal competitive structure reflects the inefficiency of radical innovation because of a few star firms at the cost of an unlimited number of failures reinforced by the so - called Valley of Death as a high sunk cost . March ( 1991 ) [ 1 ] , Teece ( 2007 ) [ 2 ] , and Kerr et al . ( 2014 ) [ 3 ] discussed the cost ( i . e . , or economy ) of radical innovation by respectively using “exploration and exploitation , ” “dynamic capability by sensing , seizing , and handling external change , ” and “social experimentation of entrepreneurship . ” Radical innovation seems inefficient due to high birth and death rates . However , because of rational searching experimentation under uncertainty , Pareto distribution in performance spontaneously shows this figure of a small number of core ( e . g . , star ) companies in the head part and many promising non - stars in the long - tail part . This distribution is a ubiquitous social , competitive structure . In addition to the later competitive failures in the Darwinian Seas , the barrier to entry into such radical innovation is the Valley of Death for small biotech startups as the higher sunk cost under uncertainty . Thus , we must examine the economic potential of biotech startup growth ( real ) options to crossover the Valley of Death as a negative profit period . D . Real Options Even in listed biotech companies in the EDGAR database , the majority is in negative profits ( except a small number of high positive profit star firms ) . Therefore , almost companies are in deficit , including unlisted companies . Real options analysis can be useful to specify and redesign the real options to change a negative net present value ( NPV ) into a positive expanded net present value ( ENPV ) to decide on investment in a risky and promising project . Myers ( 1977 ) [ 10 ] coined the idea of real options concerning the TSE by regarding the assets as underlying assets and the debt as exercise price in the balance sheet . Real options analysis depends on financial options evaluated by Black & Scholes ( 1973 ) [ 20 ] and Merton’s ( 1973 ) [ 21 ] model . There are many contributors to the fundamental concepts of real options , such as a simple discrete - time model for valuing options by arbitrage methods ( Cox et al . , 1979 ) [ 22 ] , a valuation of exchange options ( Margrabe , 1978 ) [ 23 ] , a valuation of compound options ( Geske , 1979 ) [ 24 ] , a valuation of compound exchange options ( Carr , 1988 ) [ 25 ] , and a simplified and accurate numerical method ( Andricopoulos et al . , 2003 ) [ 26 ] . Based on the development of these fundamental knowledge elements , key researchers Dixit & Pindyck ( 1994 ) [ 27 ] showed the sophisticated depth of philosophical and Authorized licensed use limited to the terms of the applicable license agreement with IEEE . Restrictions apply . mathematical study , then Trigeorgis ( 1996 ) [ 28 ] and Amran & Kulatilaka ( 1999 ) [ 29 ] emphasized the flexibility of strategic investment under uncertainty as its unique advantage . Moreover , Brennan et al . ( 2000 ) [ 30 ] integrated real options with competition and agency theory , and Grenadier ( 2001 ) [ 31 ] completed it as an option - games analysis as a new study framework . Furthermore , Schwartz & Moon ( 2000 ) [ 32 ] and Paxson & Pinto ( 2003 ) [ 33 ] applied the “option - games” approach to R & D investment . In fact , on the more practical side , Brach & Paxson ( 2001 ) [ 34 ] and Paxson ( 2003 ) [ 35 ] applied real options analysis to cases of biotech startups . Copeland & Antikarov ( 2001 ) [ 11 ] proposed a practical guideline for using various real options . Further , Mun ( 2002 ) [ 36 ] developed specialized software for empirical real options analysis . E . Research Gap and New Assumption For the valuation of innovation , Ziedonis ( 2007 ) [ 37 ] used real options analysis for licensing , and Schwartz ( 2004 ) [ 38 ] also applied it for the valuation of patents and R & D investment . Further , from a more financial perspective , Jägle ( 1999 ) [ 39 ] integrated shareholder valuation with real options and innovation , Amran & Kulatilaka ( 2000 ) [ 40 ] and Bowman & Moskowitz ( 2001 ) [ 41 ] also combined strategy and shareholder value with real options analysis . Moreover , using real options , Vassolo & Anand ( 2004 ) [ 42 ] analyzed Merck’s equity alliances in the biotech area . As aforementioned , Myers ( 1977 ) [ 10 ] already defined the TSE as a real option . However , equity value is volatile when the capital market becomes turbulent , such as in the 2008 financial crisis , due to COVID - 19 , Russia’s invasion of Ukraine , and energy - resource / climate change conditions . On the other hand , the cash and cash equivalents ( CCE ) account can be robust even if the stock market is in turmoil . Then this paper confirms the biotech startup’s potential R & D real option , regarding market cap . as the underlying asset and R & D expenses as the exercise price . Moreover , it confirms the biotech startup’s R & D resilient real option regarding market cap . as the underlying asset and CCE as the strike price ( i . e . , we assume the survival of biotech startups depends on R & D continuity ) . F . Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo Analysis Real options valuation of equity—TSE—depends on normal economic conditions . However , in turbulent conditions such as the financial crisis , COVID - 19 , and the Russian invasion of Ukraine , Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo ( McMC ) analysis is useful to seek unseen so - called “micro” signals during the transit period instead of “macro” known parameter information for existing valuation equation at steady - sate . That tool is effective for even small samples , as in this case , and its parameter estimation is performed in probability instead of the expected value of the t - test by frequentist style ( Gelman et al . , 1995 ) [ 43 ] , ( Kruschke , 2010 ) [ 44 ] . G . Complementary Factors Of course , to maximize the benefits of R & D expenditure , there are several supplementary important aspects that businesses simultaneously should consider : i . e . , Clear goals ( Chesbrough & Crowther , 2006 ) [ 45 ] , Budgeting ( Bange & De Bondet , 1998 ) [ 46 ] , Strategic partnerships ( Laperche et al . , 2011 ) [ 47 ] , Intellectual property protection ( Lee & Mansfield , 1996 ) [ 48 ] , and Continuous evaluation ( Fini et al . , 2011 ) [ 49 ] . However , this paper will mainly focus on the real option function of TSE using Bayesian McMC analysis as a first step . III . C HARACTERISTICS OF T ARGET C OMPANIES A . Pareto Distribution of Cohort Firms The 363 targeted companies in NBI were analyzed using the US SEC EDGAR database . First , as a ubiquitous competitive structure in the biotech industry , the market capitalization ( market cap . ) order of 363 companies can draw the Pareto distribution at the end of August 2022 ( Fig . 1 ) . It shows a few star - biotech companies in market cap . at the head part of the distribution . On the other hand , many non - star companies are in the long - tail position . Next , at the stage of extracting the 58 cohort ( i . e . , both in FY2008 and FY2021 ) companies from above 363 companies , emerging companies such as Moderna , BioNTech , and CRISPR Therapeutics are excluded as midway newcomers . We also ignored those companies that withdrew from NBI components due to bankruptcy or mergers and acquisitions ( M & A ) during the same period . Then looking back at the 58 cohort companies in the modified Pareto distribution ( cf . Fig . 2 ) , there are more vacant gaps in the long - tail part than in the head part due to the tendency of net new entrants to be relatively small in the market cap . B . Characteristics of Loss - making Companies i ) Net income and R & D expenses : CCE guarantee As aforementioned , the cohort 58 companies were classified into ten profitable companies and 48 unprofitable companies according to their net income as of FY2008 . There is a positive correlation between net income and R & D investment of profitable firms in FY2008 . The cash and cash equivalents ( CCE ) mediate it ( cf . Fig . 3 ) . Conversely , 82 . 75 % of the cohort companies did invest in R & D even if they had to go into a negative profit in FY2008 . Since there are no products on the market , R & D expenses easily tend to be larger than income . Their R & D investment feasibility depends on TSE and CCE security ( cf . left line in Fig . 3 ) .

Restrictions apply . ii ) Net income and market cap . : R & D investment thresholds In terms of the R & D investment in FY2008 and the market cap . as of the end of August 2022 , there are S - shaped jumps at around 500 MM ( million ) USD for profitable companies and around 300 MM USD for loss - making companies ( cf . Fig . 4 ) . Concerning the relationship with the Pareto distribution , it seems to indicate that only a small number of companies can succeed even if all of them willingly dared to invest in R & D . These critical thresholds are close to the R & D investment required for drug development as clinical tests after drug discovery and may be related to the boundary between still pipeline valuation stage and already market launched products valuation stage . iii ) Market valuation : market cap . and TSE The 2022 market cap . and FY2021 TSE , except for Amgen’s bias toward the market cap , are relatively proportional ( cf . Fig . 5 ) . The TSE shift from FY2008 to FY2021 shows comparatively rapid improvement except for Amgen ( cf . Fig . 6 ) . In addition , compared to profitable companies , unprofitable companies improved more rapidly . Despite the net loss in FY2008 , a few companies became quasi - top - level in the market cap . in August 2022 , such as Vertex 74 . 6Bn USD , third in the industry , and Regeneron 64 . 4Bn USD , fourth in the industry . The FY2008 R & D expenses of those unprofitable companies exceeded the threshold of 300MM USD ( cf . Fig . 4 ) , which may have led to the current leap . These are in positions comparable to Amgen 130 . 7 Bn , USD , first , and Gilead Sciences 79 . 7 Bn USD , second , respectively , in the industry . They were profitable companies at the time ( i . e . , FY2008 ) and currently ( i . e . , August 2022 ) lead the industry . However , among the 48 negative profit companies , 12 companies with negative TSEs ( excessive debts ) in FY2008 are included . Especially in a financial crisis , we should question the reason for their survivability . IV . C HARACTERISTICS OF E XCESS D EBT C OMPANIES A . TSE : Profitable and Unprofitable Companies First , in the TSE shift of profitable companies from FY2008 to FY2021 , most of them—except Amgen ( 20 , 386 MM USD → 6 , 700 MM USD ) , whose market cap . was overwhelmingly large but afterward has declined—have significantly increased , such as Gilead Science ( 4 , 152 MM USD → 21 , 064 MM USD ) , Biogen ( 5 , 806 MM USD → 10 , 960 MM USD ) and Illumina ( 848 MM USD → 10 , 740 MM USD ) . Moreover , TSEs can be affected by market valuations . However , market cap . is more related to investors and companies’ M & A . On the other hand , TSE is more related to corporate fundraising ( cf . blue points in Fig . 7 ) . Second , the TSE shifts of loss - making companies show much sharper improvement than those of profit - making companies ( cf . Fig . 7 ) . However , as mentioned above , the companies in negative profits are further classified into two Fig . 5 . 2022 Market cap . and FY2021 total stockholders’ equity ( TSE ) . Fig . 3 . FY2008 net income , FY2008 research and development ( R & D ) expenses , and FY2022 market capitalization ( cap . ) . Fig . 2 . FY2008 - FY2021 cohort companies ( n = 58 ) Fig . 4 .

Restrictions apply . types of companies with positive and negative TSEs at the time of FY2008 . B . Negative Profit Companies : TSE Positive and Negative Companies Among the unprofitable companies in FY2008 , representative companies with excess assets include Vertex ( i . e . , net asset value is 238 MM USD ) , Regeneron ( 418 MM USD ) , Seagen ( 79 MM USD ) , and Alnylam ( 202 MM USD ) . On the other hand , representative companies with excess debts include Incyte ( i . e . , net asset value is – 220 MM USD ) , Jazz ( - 92 MM USD ) , and Exelixis ( – 56 MM USD ) . In the TSE shift ( i . e . , FY2008 → FY2021 ) , there is a large difference in improvement between biotech firms’ original excess debts and excess assets . Furthermore , its improvement seems closely related to the market cap . in 2022 also ( cf . Fig . 8 ) . Regarding the impact on market cap . in 2022 , ongoing R & D expenses naturally must be required instead of a single year . Therefore , loss - making companies tend to have CCE , TSE , and total assets , as collateral for R & D investment . ( Figs . 9 – 12 , Table 1 ) . For instance , as of FY2008 , in terms of FY2008 R & D expenses and the CCE that supports them , in order of 2020 market cap . of excess - asset biotech firms , Vertex ( market cap . 74 . 6 Bn USD : R & D expenses 516 MM USD : CCE 389 MM USD ) was the first , followed by Regeneron , second ( 64 . 4 Bn USD : 278 MM USD : 247 MM USD ) , Seagen , third ( 30 . 2 Bn USD : 110 MM USD : 30 MM USD ) , and Alnylam , fourth ( 26 . 5 Bn USD : 96 MM USD : 191 MM USD ) . On the other hand , among excess debt companies , Incyte ( 16 . 2 Bn USD : 146 MM USD : 178 MM USD ) , Jazz ( 10 . 1 Bn USD : 69 MM USD : 24 MM USD ) , and Exelixis ( 6 . 1 Bn USD : 257 MM USD : 247 MM USD ) were ranked top three places . Thus , even if the company is in negative profit , CCE may be the primary security for investment in R & D expenses . In addition to CCE , total assets and debts ( e . g . , if negative TSE ) can also become collateral . However , it is additionally necessary to consider the reason for some leaps in 2021 TSE and 2022 market cap . ( cf . Figs . 4 , 6 ) . V . R EAL O PTIONS A NALYSIS Investment alone cannot determine everything . However , by 2022 , there had been a directly proportional relationship between the target company’s market cap . and CCE . Thus , the market mechanism neutrally functions ( e . g . , however , TSE is distorted and expanded in the middle of the distribution ; cf . , Fig . 13 ) . The 2022 market cap . thresholds are in the 300MM - 500MM USD region for R & D expenses and CCE in FY2008 ( cf . Figs . 4 and 14 ) . Fig . 6 . TSE shift : from FY2008 to FY2021 . Fig . 7 .

FY2008 R & D expenses and 2022 market cap . of FY2008 loss - making companies . Authorized licensed use limited to the terms of the applicable license agreement with IEEE . Restrictions apply . Market cap . is related to the valuation by investors in the capital market and the M & As in companies . However , equity and debt are more directly related to market valuation for strategies using in - house resources . On the other hand , CCE exhibits neutrality or robustness to market valuations except for exchange rates and is different from underlying assets easily affected by the market . Therefore , it is suitable for option exercise prices . In addition , R & D expenses also indicate an additional investment amount and can be used as an option exercise price . This study proposes the following two real options equations . First , from Fig . 4 , the call option payoff for R & D investment in FY2008 to obtain business income 14 years from the present time ( i . e . , 2022 ) is : (cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:5) (cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:10) (cid:11) (cid:12)(cid:2)(cid:13) (cid:15)(cid:16)(cid:17) (cid:18) (cid:19)(cid:20)2008(cid:24) & (cid:26) , 0(cid:28) (cid:15)1(cid:28) where (cid:16)(cid:17) (cid:11) 2022 market cap . as the “future” underlying asset , and (cid:19)(cid:20)2008(cid:24) & (cid:26) (cid:11) FY2008 R & D expenses as the “present” exercise price . Second , from Fig . 14 , the call option payoff from the FY2008 CCE securing on the R & D investment mortgage to obtain business income after 14 years is (cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:5) (cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:10) (cid:11) (cid:12)(cid:2)(cid:13) (cid:15)(cid:16)(cid:17) (cid:18) (cid:17)(cid:17)(cid:30) , 0(cid:28) (cid:15)2(cid:28) where (cid:16)(cid:17) (cid:11) 2022 market cap . as “not uncertain but already determined” underlying asset , and (cid:17)(cid:17)(cid:30) (cid:11) FY2008CCE as another robust exercise price . In both equations , MC = 2022 market caps . are not usual probabilistic underlying asset values but backwardly reflecting determined values . Then we must transfer this persistent condition into a stochastic setting for forecasting use . In the first equation , the exercise price is R & D expenses . Thus , this can estimate R & D productivity in a 14 - year time lag ( i . e . , it reflects long - term drug development time ) . The second equation is vital to CCE’s hedge function for continuing R & D against a turbulent capital market environment . Thus , we will examine the Bayesian method in the next section . Fig . 10 .

B AYESIAN M C MC A NALYSIS : C OMPARISON OF R & D P RODUCTIVITY BY T HE F INANCIAL C ONDITION This section applied Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo ( McMC ) analysis using RStan . First , we applied the Bayesian Analysis of Variance ( ANOVA ) to estimate the relationship between FY2008 financial condition ( e . g . , PP = positive profit , NPposiTSE = negative profit positive TSE , and NPnegaTSE = negative profit negative TSE as shown in Fig . 15 and Table II ) . Rhat values of all representative variables are less than 1 . 1 . Moreover , effective sample sizes are all more than 100 . Then the result of Table II has conversed . Each position of a limited number of top levels is in line with favorable financial conditions : first place is PP , second place is NP - positive TSE , and third place is NP - negative TSE companies’ groups . This result is natural . However , Fig . 15 shows overlapping areas in the market cap . Second , we infer the R & D productivity of each FY2008 finance conditional biotech firm by applying a normal linear model as follows : (cid:3) (cid:31) ~ ! (cid:4) " (cid:12)(cid:2) # (cid:15) $ (cid:31) , % (cid:8) (cid:28) (cid:15)3(cid:28) $ (cid:31) (cid:11) ’ (cid:31)(cid:9) ( ’ (cid:31) ) (cid:13) (cid:31) where (cid:3) (cid:31) (cid:11) 2022 market cap . ( MM USD ) , (cid:13) (cid:31) (cid:11) FY2008 R & D expenses ( MM USD ) , ’ (cid:9) (cid:11) intercept , ’ ) (cid:11) slope ( i . e . , R & D productivity ) , ! (cid:4) " (cid:12)(cid:2) # (cid:15)∙(cid:28) (cid:11) normal distribution , $ (cid:11) expected value , % (cid:11) standard deviation , + (cid:11) 1 : PP , + (cid:11) 2 : NP positive TSE , and + (cid:11) 3 : NP negative TSE ( i . e . , each financial condition ) . Using R ' s fitted function , we got each parameter estimation of the FY2008 finance conditional biotech firms’ R & D productivity shown in Fig . 16 and Table III . As a result , contrary to common belief , the R & D productivity ( i . e . , 2022 market cap . divided by FY2008 R & D expenses for FY2008 each financial condition ) parameter order is as follows : first place is NP - positive TSE ( i . e . , the estimated slope is 95 . 89 ) , the second order is PP ( 26 . 28 ) , and third place is NP - negative TSE ( 19 . 29 ) . That is , NP - positive TSE biotech firms’ R & D productivity was highest and higher than PP biotech firms’ R & D productivity . In other words , they must have enough entrepreneurship to overcome the Valley of Death . On the other hand , PP firms , for instance , may have more interest in manufacturing than R & D due to their larger sizes . At the Fig . 15 . 2022 market cap . by FY2008 financial status . Fig . 16 . FY2008 R & D productivity by financial status Note : number 1 = PP = positive profit , number 2 = NPposiTSE = negative profit positive TSE , and number 3 = NPnegaTSE = negative profit negative TSE , MarketCap = market cap . , RDexp = R & D expenses .

Restrictions apply . same time , NP - negative TSE firms’ coefficient is also not negative but still positive . As a side note , as of 2022 , some excess debt companies have become successful enough after the financial crisis , as shown in Table I , e . g . , Incyte : security symbol INCY and Exelixis : EXEL . That is , some NP - negative TSE top companies had depended on debt financing and total assets as the financial sources of resilient recovery . VII . F INDINGS Thus , in response to the above awareness of the problems , we can answer the following solutions : ( i ) How could loss - making biotech startups survive a financial crisis ? They have usually kept TSE positive . ( ii ) What was the R & D investment method for excess debt biotech startups in the financial crisis ? They have maintained additional cash flow with CCE , debts , and total assets through technological potentials such as Incyte and Exelixis . ( iii ) Among the current star - biotech companies , what were the characteristics of the loss - making firms’ R & D investment in the financial crisis ? They boldly made R & D investments that exceeded the “normal” threshold without fear of temporary deficits and excess debt within the reasonable guideline . “The criterion shows that a negative profit is almost no problem ; however , if possible , it had better a positive TSE . ” Over - indebtedness takes longer to recover than a negative profit , as a larger deviation from the normal financial condition . A . Match & Contribution As one of the study contributions , this paper proposed at first a technological option regarding future market cap . as an underlying asset and R & D expenses as an exercise price in equation ( 1 ) , and secondly , a robust option regarding future market cap . as an underlying asset and CCE as the exercise price in equation ( 2 ) in the financial crisis ( i . e . , FY2008 ) . Also , we got evidence that NP positive - TSE biotech firms’ R & D productivity was higher than PP biotech firms in the financial crisis ( cf . Fig . 16 ) . It shows negative profit R & D investment within positive equity as a reasonable guideline . However , we must still monitor the future recovery speed and trajectory of some leading NP negative - TSE biotech startups ( e . g . , Incyte and Exelixis ) . VIII . C ONCLUSION From an academic perspective , the existing R & D investment in biotech firms relates to the concepts of the Pareto distribution and the Valley of Death for a risk hedge against sunk cost under uncertainty as real options . However , we need a more active feedforward hedge function than a passive one ( e . g . , feedforward control by Bayesian McMC signaling ) . From a practical perspective , biotech entrepreneurs and venture capital investors can find guidelines to support biotech firms and startups in negative profit and excess debt even in a turbulent capital market . From policymakers’ perspective , this paper shows reasonable financial support guidelines for biotech startups , venture capital , and other players in turbulent capital markets within biotech clusters , even in a financial crisis . As one of the remaining problems , we still need to find a clearer survival boundary of excess debt biotech companies in a financial crisis and the recovery speed as resilient capacity . Moreover , as this paper’s other limit , it depends on only financial data analysis . Then , in the future , we need to integrate economic and technical studies using , for instance , human scientific resources , science papers , and patents . Furthermore , as aforementioned , we also must consider other factors such as budgeting , strategic partnerships , intellectual property protection , and continuous evaluation in the future .
