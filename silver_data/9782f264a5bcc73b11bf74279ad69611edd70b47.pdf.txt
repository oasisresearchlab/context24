RES EAR CH A RT I C LE Open Access Fusing literature and full network data improves disease similarity computation Ping Li 1 , 2 , Yaling Nie 1 , 2 and Jingkai Yu 1 * Abstract Background : Identifying relatedness among diseases could help deepen understanding for the underlying pathogenic mechanisms of diseases , and facilitate drug repositioning projects . A number of methods for computing disease similarity had been developed ; however , none of them were designed to utilize information of the entire protein interaction network , using instead only those interactions involving disease causing genes . Most of previously published methods required gene - disease association data , unfortunately , many diseases still have very few or no associated genes , which impeded broad adoption of those methods . In this study , we propose a new method ( MedNetSim ) for computing disease similarity by integrating medical literature and protein interaction network . MedNetSim consists of a network - based method ( NetSim ) , which employs the entire protein interaction network , and a MEDLINE - based method ( MedSim ) , which computes disease similarity by mining the biomedical literature . Results : Among function - based methods , NetSim achieved the best performance . Its average AUC ( area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ) reached 95 . 2 % . MedSim , whose performance was even comparable to some function - based methods , acquired the highest average AUC in all semantic - based methods . Integration of MedSim and NetSim ( MedNetSim ) further improved the average AUC to 96 . 4 % . We further studied the effectiveness of different data sources . It was found that quality of protein interaction data was more important than its volume . On the contrary , higher volume of gene - disease association data was more beneficial , even with a lower reliability . Utilizing higher volume of disease - related gene data further improved the average AUC of MedNetSim and NetSim to 97 . 5 % and 96 . 7 % , respectively . Conclusions : Integrating biomedical literature and protein interaction network can be an effective way to compute disease similarity . Lacking sufficient disease - related gene data , literature - based methods such as MedSim can be a great addition to function - based algorithms . It may be beneficial to steer more resources torward studying gene - disease associations and improving the quality of protein interaction data .

It may also be useful for identifying novel drug indications [ 3 ] , as similar diseases may have the same or similar thera - peutic targets , which suggests they could be treated with the same or similar drugs . There has been a growing interest in quantitatively measuring similarities between diseases [ 4 – 7 ] . Phenotypic similarity plays an important role in a number of biological and biomedical applications [ 8 ] . During the past years , based on the Human Phenotype Ontology ( HPO ) [ 9 ] , researchers had designed several methods to find related diseases and predict disease - causing genes , such as Phenomizer [ 10 ] , Exomiser [ 11 ] and PhenIX [ 12 ] . The HPO provides a controlled and standardized vocabulary of phenotypic abnormalities that characterize human diseases . Phenotype similarity also , becomes the most common way to define classifi - cation rules for diseases . The classification of disease terms in Medical Subject Headings ( MeSH ) [ 13 ] and Disease Ontology ( DO ) [ 14 ] are taking this approach . To quantify disease similarity , several semantic - based methods had thus been proposed based on HPO , MeSH or DO , such as Resnik [ 15 ] , Lin [ 16 ] and Wang [ 17 ] . Resnik ’ s method measures disease similarity based on in - formation content ( IC ) of the most informative common ancestor ( MICA ) between two terms . Besides IC of MICA , Lin ’ s method also considers the IC of the two compared diseases [ 16 ] . Wang et al . ’ s method [ 17 ] com - putes similarity of a disease pair by considering the con - tribution of all common ancestors in the ontology . It had been successfully applied to compute similarity be - tween MeSH [ 18 ] terms . All of those semantic - based methods exploited disease associations based on ontol - ogies and / or gene annotations . They did not , however , consider the functional associations between disease - related gene sets . The BOG ( based on overlapping gene sets ) method was thus designed by Mathur and Dinakar - pandian [ 19 ] , which calculates disease similarity by exploiting the co - occurrence of disease - related genes . Mathur et al . [ 20 ] also devised a process - similarity based ( PSB ) method . Instead of defining disease similarity as a function of genes , PSB computes disease similarity based on Gene Ontology ( GO ) [ 21 ] biological process terms associated with those genes . PSB achieved a better performance than BOG [ 20 ] . Functional associations be - tween genes involve not only GO terms [ 22 ] , but also co - expression [ 23 ] , protein - protein interaction [ 24 ] , etc . Cheng et al . recently presented the method FunSim [ 25 ] , which measures disease similarity using a weighted hu - man protein interaction network . The first neighbors of disease - related genes in the protein network were taken into account . FunSim further improved the results of PSB [ 25 ] . Although a number of methods for computing disease similarity had been developed , no method had been pro - posed to take advantage of the entire protein interaction network , beyond using only the first neighbors . A network - based method ( NetSim ) is proposed which takes advantage of the entire interaction network . The effectiveness of different data sources were also evalu - ated , including gene - disease associations and protein - protein interactions . Most of the previously developed methods were based on disease - related genes . However , many diseases still have very few or no associated genes . Relying entirely on disease - related genes greatly limits the utility of those methods . To overcome the limitation , a new semantic - based similarity measure ( MedSim ) is developed to compute disease similarity based on the MEDLINE database . MedSim and NetSim were eventu - ally integrated into MedNetSim to further improve com - puting performance . Methods Diseases and gene - disease association databases The disease terms in DO were chosen as the vocabulary for describing diseases . DO database is a biomedical re - source of disease concepts with stable identifiers orga - nized by disease etiology [ 14 ] . It contains 6 , 457 non - obsolete disease terms and 6 , 819 ‘ IS _ A ’ relationships among diseases . The non - obsolete disease terms was used as the disease vocabulary . Each disease in DO has a unique identifier , called DOID . SIDD [ 26 ] and DisGeNET [ 27 ] were adopted as two disease - gene association databases ( Fig . 1 ) . SIDD inte - grated five disease - related gene databases : GeneRIF [ 28 ] , Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man ( OMIM ) [ 29 ] , Comparative Toxicogenomics Database ( CTD ) [ 30 ] , Genetic Association Database ( GAD ) [ 31 ] , and SpliceDi - sease [ 32 ] . In total , SIDD contains 2 , 427 diseases and 104 , 052 gene - disease associations ( see Additional file 1 ) . Li et al . BMC Bioinformatics ( 2016 ) 17 : 326 Page 2 of 13 The DisGeNET [ 27 ] database integrated human gene - disease associations from various expert curated databases and text - mining derived associations including Mendelian , complex and environmental diseases . Compared to SIDD , DisGeNET had more lower reliability disease - gene associ - ations based on literature mining , i . e . , LHGDN [ 33 ] and BeFree data [ 34 ] . DisGeNET contains 14 , 619 diseases and 429 , 111 gene - disease associations . UMLS ID ( Unified Medical Language System Identifier ) was used as the unique identifier for each disease in DisGeNET . We mapped UMLS ID to DOID , which produced 3 , 259 dis - ease terms and 206 , 403 gene - disease associations ( see Additional file 2 ) . Almost every disease term in DisGeNET has more associated genes than that in SIDD . All source data were downloaded until April 30 , 2015 . Protein interaction datasets Two protein interaction datasets were used ( Fig . 2 ) . One is hPPIN , built in house , which integrated four existing protein interaction databases , i . e . , BioGrid [ 35 ] , HPRD [ 36 ] , IntAct [ 37 ] , and HomoMINT [ 38 ] . Protein identi - fiers were mapped to the genes coding for the proteins , and redundant interactions were removed . The acquired protein interaction network covered 15 , 710 human genes and 143 , 237 interactions ( Fig . 2 ) . The other is HumanNet [ 39 ] , which is a genome - scale functional net - work for human genes . To build HumanNet , 21 diverse functional genomics and proteomics datasets were eval - uated for their tendencies to link human genes in the same biological processes . Pairwise gene linkages derived from the individual datasets were then integrated into a comprehensive HumanNet [ 39 ] . HumanNet contains 476 , 399 functional linkages among 16 , 243 human genes ( Fig . 2 ) . Unlike hPPIN which mainly focuses on experi - mentally verified protein interactions , HumanNet was constructed based on the functional probability that two genes belonged to the same biological processes . The two protein interaction datasets have 13 , 626 genes and 42 , 584 interactions in common ( called comPPI , Fig . 2 ) . Additionally , different proportions of hPPIN ( 5 % , 10 % , 20 % , 40 % , 60 % , 80 % , 90 % ) were randomly sampled 20 times and used as the protein interaction datasets to evau - late the impact of data volume on the proposed method . Medline - based disease similarity ( MedSim ) Biomedical literature contains rich and diverse informa - tion , such as disease symptoms , pathogenesis , thera - peutic drugs , and so on . Features representing diseases were generated through mining the biomedical literature corpus ; the features were then utilized to compute disease similarity ( MedSim method , Fig . 3 ) . MedSim was not limited to use only one aspect of disease information ( i . e . , disease - related genes ) , but took advantages of all relevant information that had already been archived in the literature . Disease corpus The text corpus contains all MEDLINE abstracts pub - lished up to year 2015 . The non - obsolete disease terms in DO were used as the disease vocabulary . Each disease Fig 1 Gene - disease association databases . a : The number of diseases , b : The number of associations between genes and diseases Fig 2 Protein interaction datasets . a : The number of genes , b : The number of interactions between genes , * : The common protein - protein interactions Li et al . BMC Bioinformatics ( 2016 ) 17 : 326 Page 3 of 13 term was mapped to Unified Medical Language System ( UMLS ) [ 40 ] so that its synonyms could be retrieved . Syn - onyms were taken directly from DO for diseases that could not be mapped to UMLS . Every disease term and its synonyms were then used as keywords to perform keyword - based queries into MEDLINE to retrieve ab - stracts related to that disease . To limit computational cost , only the top 100 most relevant abstracts were selected to construct the bag - of - words model for diseases . The rele - vance of an abstract to a disease was defined in Eq . 1 . R abstract ¼ X W W df (cid:2) W of ð 1 Þ Where W df and W of represent document frequency and occurrence frequency of a word X , respectively . Document frequency W df is the proportion of abstracts that contain word X . W df represents the relevance of word X to a disease . Occurrence frequency W of repre - sents the number of times word X occurs in an abstract , measuring the importance of word X in a specific ab - stract . For a specific disease , W is defined as the set of nouns ( Xs ) which appeared in abstracts when W df is greater than 0 . 005 . Larger R abstract means that an ab - stract is more closely related to the disease . Some dis - eases were not yet broadly studied , so their number of retrieved abstracts can be less than 100 . For those cases , all retrieved abstracts were used . For each disease , the selected most relevant abstracts were merged into one combined document . At the end of preprocessing , every disease was associated with one document . These docu - ments together made up the disease corpus . Constructing the bag - of - words model and computing MedSim The disease corpus was tokenized to obtain word vo - cabulary , using Python package NLTK ( Nature Language Toolkit , www . nltk . org ) to remove non - alphabetic words and reduce inflected / derived words to their stem . Overly common ( appeared in more than 60 % of the docu - ments ) or rare ( appeared in less than 4 documents ) words were removed , as those words could not provide meaningful information . Each disease was then repre - sented by a word vector , whose dimensionality is the size of the word vocabulary . Each dimension was assigned a weight ( TF - IDF , that is , TF times IDF ) based on term fre - quency ( TF ) and inverse document frequency ( IDF ) values . TF is the number of times a word appears in a document . IDF represents the inverse of the number of documents containing the word . TF - IDF assigns larger weights to words that appeared more often in a document but only in a small percentage of all documents , as those words are important and informative for that document . With diseases represented as TF - IDF weighted vectors , the MedSim of two diseases was measured by calculating the cosine similarity of the two vectors . Python package scikit - learn [ 41 ] was used to perform the computation . Network - based disease similarity ( NetSim ) Previously published methods weren ’ t designed to utilize the entire protein interaction network . They instead fo - cused only on the disease - related genes or their first neighbors in the network . To take full advantage of the entire protein interaction network , random walk with re - start ( RWR ) [ 42 , 43 ] ( see [ 44 ] for working details ) was used to measure Functional Relevance ( FR ) between a gene g and a gene set G , which is described in Eq . 2 . FR G ð g Þ ¼ P RWR g ∈ protein interaction network 1 g ∉ protein interaction network and g ∈ G 0 g ∉ protein interaction network and g ∉ G Þ 8 > > < > > : ð 2 Þ Fig 3 Overview of MedSim . DO : Human Disease Ontology database ; UMLS : Unified Medical Language System Li et al . BMC Bioinformatics ( 2016 ) 17 : 326 Page 4 of 13 Where gene set G was defined to be the seed genes , that is , the known set of genes associated with a disease . The initial probability of each seed genes was set to 1 . 0 . P RWR represents the acquired steady - state probability of gene g after running RWR in the whole protein inter - action network . A larger probability ( FR G ( g ) ) will be assigned to gene g when it sits more closely to the gene set G in the network according to Eq . 2 , which means that gene g are more functionally related with gene set G . Suppose that G 1 = { g 11 , g 12 , … } and G 2 = { g 21 , g 22 , … } are the seed gene sets for disease d 1 and d 2 , respectively . Then , the NetSim of d 1 and d 2 is defined in Eq . 3 . NeSim G 1 ; G 2 ð Þ ¼ X 1 ≤ i ≤ len G 1 ð Þ FR G 2 g 1 i (cid:2) (cid:3) þ X 1 ≤ j ≤ len G 2 ð Þ FR G 1 g 2 j (cid:4) (cid:5) len G 1 ð Þþ len G 2 ð Þ ; g 1 i ∈ G 1 ; g 2 j ∈ G 2 ð 3 Þ Where len ( G 1 ) and len ( G 2 ) are the number of genes in G 1 and G 2 , respectively . The numerator is the sum of func - tional relevance of g 1i to G 2 and g 2j to G 1 . A higher NetSim value represents closer connection between G 1 and G 2 , which suggests closer ties between diseases d 1 and d 2 . MedSim and NetSim is combined into MedNetSim , which is defined in Eq . 4 . MedNetSim d 1 ; d 2 ð Þ ¼ MedSim d 1 ; d 2 ð Þ (cid:2) NetSim G 1 ; G 2 ð Þ ð 4 Þ Where d 1 and d 2 are two diseases in DO , G 1 and G 2 are the seed gene sets for d 1 and d 2 , respectively . Performance evaluation Similarities of disease pairs in the benchmark set and the random set were calculated and ranked in descend - ing order , receiver operating characteristic ( ROC ) [ 45 ] curves were then drawn to evaluate and quantify the predictive power of the proposed methods . A ROC curve is a plot of the true positive rate of a classifier as a function of the false positive rate . The area under the ROC curve ( AUC ) is used as a quantitative measure of a classifier ’ s quality [ 46 ] . Disease pairs in the benchmark set and the random set are defined as positives and neg - atives , respectively . True positives are the disease pairs in the benchmark set that are correctly predicted by a classifier , and false positives are those disease pairs from the random set that are predicted to be positives but not found in the benchmark set . More percentage of disease pairs in the benchmark set receiving higher rankings means better AUC values . The benchmark set was taken from reference [ 25 ] . It had 47 diseases and 70 disease pairs ( see Additional file 3 ) with high similarity derived from two manually checked datasets by Suthram et al . [ 2 ] and Pakhomov et al . [ 47 ] . Cancers were omitted . The benchmark set contains disease pairs that are expected to be related to each other , such as Alzheimer ’ s disease ( DOID : 10652 ) and schizophrenia ( DOID : 5419 ) , dia - betes mellitus ( DOID : 9351 ) and obesity ( DOID : 9970 ) . It also includes some pairs that are not apparently re - lated , but were found to be correlated by various evi - dences , such as asthma ( DOID : 2841 ) and diabetes mellitus , malaria ( DOID : 12365 ) and anemia ( DOID : 2355 ) . 700 disease pairs were randomly selected from DO to generate a random set , with disease pairs from the benchmark set removed from the generated random set . To get an average AUC of the proposed methods , the above experiment was iterated 50 times by calculating similarities of disease pairs in the benchmark set and 50 random sets . MedSim was compared with other semantic - based methods including Resnik [ 15 ] , Lin [ 16 ] and Wang [ 17 ] , based on HPO and DO , respectively . For each disease , the associated HPO annotations were acquired from [ 48 ] , which covered disease - phenotype associations for over 6000 common , rare , infectious and Mendelian dis - eases through text - mining approach . The HPO - based disease similarities were defined by calculating the se - mantic similarity of their associated HPO phenotypes . For two diseases ( d 1 , d 2 ) , the HPO - based similarity of d 1 to d 2 is defined as follows : HPO sim d 1 → d 2 ð Þ ¼ avg X s ∈ d 1 max t ∈ d 2 SemSim s ; t ð Þ 2 4 3 5 ð 5 Þ Where s and t are the annotated phenotypes of d 1 and d 2 , respectively . SemSim ( ) is one of the methods applied to compute the semantic similarity of two phenotype terms , including Resnik , Lin and Wang . Eq . 5 , for each pheno - type term of d 1 , found the “ best match ” among the pheno - type terms annotated to d 2 , and the average overall phenotype terms was calculated . Note that this similarity is asymmetric , i . e . , HPO _ sim ( d 1 → d 2 ) is not always equal to HPO _ sim ( d 2 → d 1 ) . Therefore , we used a symmetric HPO - based similarity , which is defined in Eq . 6 : HPO sim d 1 ; d 2 ð Þ ¼ 1 2 HPO sim d 1 → d 2 ð Þ þ 1 2 HPO sim d 2 → d 1 ð Þ ð 6 Þ The DO - based disease similarities were defined as the directly semantic similarity of two disease terms in DO , where the above mentioned three semantic - base methods ( Resnik , Lin and Wang ) were applied , too . Net - Sim was also compared with other function - based methods including BOG [ 19 ] , PSB [ 20 ] and FunSim [ 25 ] . Parameters of the aforementioned methods were set to values used in the original paper . Li et al . BMC Bioinformatics ( 2016 ) 17 : 326 Page 5 of 13 Constructing disease similarity network ( DSN ) Disease terms from DO were used as nodes in the simi - larity network between diseases ( DSN ) . We computed the pair - wise similarity for a total of 3 , 201 diseases ( with both associated genes and literature information ) by the proposed method MedNetSim . If the similarity of a dis - ease pair was ranked in the top 0 . 5 % , an undirected weighted edge between the disease pair was drawn . The network was visualized with the force - directed layout al - gorithm of Cytoscape [ 49 ] and colored according to top - level DO categories . Results and discussion Utilizing the entire network benefits disease similarity computation Similarities of disease pairs in the benchmark set and a random set were calculated by NetSim and other function - based methods . As shown in Fig . 4a , the BOG method , with an AUC of 83 . 3 % , had the worst perform - ance among function - based methods . Linking genes based on the GO biological process ontology [ 21 ] , PSB method had significantly improved performance , achiev - ing an AUC of 91 . 1 % . Considering nearest neighbors of disease - related genes in protein interaction network , FunSim improved its AUC to 94 . 3 % . The proposed method , NetSim , which utilized the entire protein inter - action network , further improved its AUC to 95 . 1 % . The results show that utilizing the entire network can increase computing performance for disease similarity calculation . Integrating MedSim ( see next section ) and NetSim , the MedNetSim achieved the highest AUC among all function - based methods , improving its AUC to 96 . 5 % . The performance improvement indicates that integration of MEDLINE and protein interaction net - work can be an effective way to compute disease similar - ities . To check the stability of NetSim and MedNetSim , the above computation was repeated 50 times by calcu - lating similarities using 50 randomly generated disease pair sets . Fig 4b shows the average AUC of BOG ( 82 . 6 % ) , PSB ( 90 . 9 % ) , FunSim ( 94 . 4 % ) , NetSim ( 95 . 2 % ) and MedNetSim ( 96 . 4 % ) , which is consistent with Fig . 4a . The MedNetSim similarity values of all disease pairs were computed , and a distribution of 5 , 121 , 600 similar - ity values ( between 3 , 201 diseases ) was acquired . The ranking of a similarity value in the distribution was used to compute its corresponding p - value . If the MedNetSim similarity value of a disease pair is in the highest - ranking 5 % of the distribution ( which generates a p - value of 0 . 05 ) , the two diseases are considered related . To evalu - ate the ability of MedNetSim in discriminating positive and negative cases , the p - values of similarities of disease pairs in the benchmark set and a random set were calcu - lated ( Additional file 4 ) . For the benchmark set , 57 dis - ease pairs were recognized as highly related diseases correctly and 13 disease pairs did not show a significant p - values ( false negatives ) . The false negatives can be di - vided into two groups . The first group had a non - Fig 4 Performance of function - based methods . a ROC curves for the benchmark set and a random set . b Average AUC for the benchmark set and 50 random sets Li et al . BMC Bioinformatics ( 2016 ) 17 : 326 Page 6 of 13 significant p - value of MedSim similarity , but a signifi - cant p - value of NetSim similarity , e . g . , polycystic ovary syndrome ( DOID : 11612 ) & myocardial infarction ( DOID : 5844 ) , malaria ( DOID : 12365 ) & epilepsy syn - drome ( DOID : 1826 ) ( Table 1 ) . The missed calling of be - ing positives for those disease pairs was mainly due to the very bad results of MedSim . That is to say , the re - search literature contains less information about their relatedness , therefore dragging down the performance of MedNetSim . For those disease pairs , NetSim may be a better choice . In the second group , both MedSim and NetSim similarities did not show significant p - values . A representative disease of the second group was lipid storage disease ( DOID : 9455 ) . 5 out of the 6 disease pairs between lipid storage disease and other diseases in the benchmark set were incorrectly identified , e . g . , lipid storage disease & obesity ( DOID : 9970 ) , lipid storage disease & diabetes mellitus ( DOID : 9351 ) ( Table 1 ) . The number of associated genes of obesity and diabetes mel - litus was 1 , 527 and 1 , 134 , respectively . Lipid storage dis - ease only had 35 associated genes . Out of the 35 associated genes , 15 and 12 genes were shared by obesity and diabetes mellitus , respectively . Although more than 1 / 3 associated genes of lipid storage disease appeared in obesity and diabetes mellitus , they still got a bad NetSim results . That is because obesity and diabetes mellitus had a much bigger number of associated genes than lipid storage disease . This indicates that NetSim performs less well when two diseases have a large difference in the number of disease - associated genes . For the random set , 36 out of 700 disease pairs were recognized as related diseases ( false positives ) . More than half of the 36 dis - ease pairs were cancer related diseases , e . g . , penile neo - plasm ( DOID : 11624 ) & cecum cancer ( DOID : 1521 ) , pancreatic cancer ( DOID : 1793 ) & tubular adenocarcin - oma ( DOID : 4929 ) ( Table 1 ) . As cancer diseases were omitted in selecting benchmark set , it is not surprising that so many disease pairs related to cancers are de - tected as false positives . The relatedness of diseases belonging to different top - level DO categories was also identified , e . g . , essential hypertension ( DOID : 10825 ) & hyperthyroidism ( DOID : 7998 ) . Recently , Emokpae et al . had pointed out that hyperthyroidism was the most common thyroid disorder observed in patients with es - sential hypertension [ 50 ] . It indicates that our method can recognize related diseases which apparently seem unrelated . In addition , the relationship of impulse con - trol disorder ( DOID : 10937 ) & narcissistic personality disorder ( DOID : 2745 ) was also detected ( Table 1 ) . The two disease are both in the “ disease of mental health ” ( DOID : 150 ) category , but there is no report on their re - latedness . Therefore , MedNetSim can also discover new unknown relatedness among diseases . MedSim can be a useful supplement to function - based methods ROC curves of MedSim and other semantic - based methods based on HPO and DO , respectively , were also generated ( Fig . 5a ) . For the methods based on HPO , Lin ’ s method ( HPO _ Lin ) had the worst performance with an AUC of only 54 . 4 % , and Wang et al . ’ s method ( HPO _ wang , 67 . 3 % ) acquired the best performance among the three methods . As HPO was replaced by DO to calculate disease similarity , Resnik ’ s method ( 64 . 7 % ) became the worst method , and Wang et al . ’ s method still had the best performance with an AUC of 69 . 2 % . Over - all , performances of HPO - based methods are similar to DO - based methods . However , compared to computing disease similarity based on ontologies , the proposed MedSim had a significantly better performance than those methods . MedSim achieved an AUC of 83 . 5 % , which is even slightly better than the function - based method BOG . Figure 5b shows the average AUC for all semantic - based methods . The result is consistent with Fig . 5a . Two reasons may explain why MedSim achieved the best performance among semantic - based methods . On the one hand , previous methods suffered from the in - completeness of ontologies and the lack of coverage of Table 1 Examples of false negatives and false positives with p - values from MedNetSim Disease 1 Disease 2 P - value ( MedSim ) P - value ( NetSim ) P - value ( MedNetSim ) False negatives polycystic ovary syndrome myocardial infarction 0 . 663 0 . 004 0 . 051 lipid storage disease obesity 0 . 107 0 . 148 0 . 070 malaria epilepsy syndrome 0 . 675 0 . 016 0 . 075 lipid storage disease diabetes mellitus 0 . 108 0 . 156 0 . 075 False positives impulse control disorder narcissistic personality disorder 0 . 023 0 . 001 0 . 002 penile neoplasm cecum cancer 0 . 023 0 . 007 0 . 004 pancreatic cancer tubular adenocarcinoma 0 . 003 0 . 107 0 . 006 essential hypertension hyperthyroidism 0 . 210 0 . 021 0 . 030 Li et al . BMC Bioinformatics ( 2016 ) 17 : 326 Page 7 of 13 gene - disease or phenotype - disease association data . For ex - ample , only one - third of DO diseases have associated genes ( see Additional file 1 ) . HPO is widely used in the rare dis - ease community [ 51 ] . However , the infrastructure of phenotype data for common and infectious diseases [ 48 ] is still developing . On the other hand , MedSim considered much richer and more diverse information included in lit - erature , not only disease - related genes , but also disease symptoms , pathogenesis , therapeutic drugs , and so on . MedSim requires only biomedical literature , no re - quirement to know disease - associated gene sets and on - tologies . It thus has much broader applicability than previously published methods , especially in the case of no sufficient gene - disease association data . The impact of different data sources Gene - disease association databases The effectiveness of different gene - disease association data was evaluated . DisGeNET was used as a replace - ment for SIDD . Compared to SIDD , DisGeNET has much more lower reliability associations based on litera - ture mining . Its disease - gene associations are nearly two times of those in SIDD , with only 34 % more disease terms ( Fig . 1 ) . Using DisGeNET as gene - disease associ - ation data source , the AUC of NetSim ( called as Net - Sim _ DGN ) grew to 96 . 9 % ( Fig . 6a ) , which is even better than MedNetSim ( AUC : 96 . 5 % , Fig . 4a ) that fused Med - Sim and NetSim . Integration of MedSim and NetSim _ DGN ( MedNetSim _ DGN ) produced an AUC of 97 . 5 % ( Fig . 6a ) . Fig . 6b shows the average AUC of Net - Sim _ DGN ( 96 . 7 % ) and MedNetSim _ DGN ( 97 . 5 % ) , which is consistent with Fig . 6a too . The above observa - tions show that a richer gene - disease association data , even with a lower reliability , is favorable for discovering relatedness between diseases . Protein interaction datasets To gauge the impact of different interaction datasets on computing performance , HumanNet database was used as the protein interaction network , substituting hPPIN . The number of protein nodes in HumanNet and hPPIN do not differ greatly , but the number of interactions in HumanNet is more than three times that of hPPIN ( Fig . 2 ) . However , the performance of NetSim while using HumanNet ( named as NetSim _ HN ) did not im - prove at all compared to using hPPIN , with both achiev - ing an AUC of 95 . 1 % ( Fig . 6a ) . Furthermore , the common interaction pairs of hPPIN and HumanNet ( i . e . , comPPI ) were also applied as the protein interaction network to evaluate the performance of NetSim ( Net - Sim _ comPPI , Fig . 6a ) . Although comPPI had a much smaller dataset than hPPIN or HumanNet , NetSim _ - comPPI achieved the same performance as NetSim and NetSim _ HN , with an AUC of 95 . 1 % too . The average AUC of NetSim _ HN and NetSim _ comPPI ( Fig . 6b ) also showed the same results .

HPO _ Res , HPO _ Lin and HPO _ Wang denoted disease similarities computation by using Resnik , Lin and Wang based on HPO , respectively Li et al . BMC Bioinformatics ( 2016 ) 17 : 326 Page 8 of 13 Additionally , the average AUC of NetSim with differ - ent proportions of hPPIN were also computed . As shown in Fig . 7 , the average AUC increased rapidly at the beginning , it then leveled off and did not grow as fast once the sampling rate hit 60 % . The average AUC plateaued at a sampling rate of 80 % . The above results indicate that merely using more protein interaction data does not lead to improved performance of NetSim . It might partially explain why using HumanNet , which has more than three times protein interaction data than hPPIN , did not improve the performance of NetSim . Percentage of interaction pairs sharing GO annotation was analyzed for HumanNet , hPPIN and their common protein interactions ( comPPI ) ( Table 2 ) . For the entire GO annotation and its three categories ( GO _ BP : bio - logical process , GO _ CC : cellular component , GO _ MF : molecular function ) , the percentage of pairs sharing an - notation in hPPIN was higher than that in HumanNet , suggesting hPPIN has a higher data quality than HumanNet . The fact that HumanNet did not achieve improved performance for NetSim may partially be due to HumanNet ’ s lower data quality than that of hPPIN . In addition , whether the entire GO or its three categories , comPPI had the highest percentage of protein pairs shar - ing annotation in the three datasets , indicating that comPPI has the best data quality . The highest data qual - ity of comPPI may be responsible for it acquiring same performance as that of hPPIN or HumanNet . All those results suggest that the quality of protein interaction data is more important than its volume for the computa - tion of disease similarity . Disease similarity network As shown in Fig . 8 , a disease similarity network ( DSN ) was generatedty based on MedNetSim from the top - ranking 0 . 5 % of pair - wise similarity values among 3 , 201 Fig 6 The impact of different data sources . a ROC curves for the experimental results on the benchmark set and a random set . b Average AUC for the benchmark set and 50 random sets Fig 7 The average AUC of NetSim with different proportion of hPPIN sampled Li et al . BMC Bioinformatics ( 2016 ) 17 : 326 Page 9 of 13 diseases in DO . 2 , 885 of the 3 , 201 diseases showed at least one connection to another disease , and 25 , 607 edges were formed between those diseases ( Additional file 5 ) . Each node in the network represented a disease . Those nodes belonged to 14 top - level DO categories and were colored according to their corresponding DO cat - egories , such as “ respiratory system disease ” ( DOID : 1579 ) , “ metabolic disease ” ( DOID : 0014667 ) , “ infectious disease ” ( DOID : 0050117 ) , and so on . DO classified diseases both by anatomical site or system , and by gen - eral pathology . For each of the classifications , despite these different criteria , diseases within one category were usually in close proximity to each other ( Fig . 8 ) , such as “ disease of cellular proliferation ” ( DOID : 14566 ) , “ dis - ease of mental health ” ( DOID : 150 ) , “ nervous system disease ” ( DOID : 863 ) , and so on . MedNetSim can also identify related disease groups belonging to different DO category . One example of these is myasthenia gravis ( DOID : 437 ) which belongs to the “ nervous system disease ” ( DOID : 863 ) category . Figure 9a showed the sub - network around myasthenia gravis ( MG ) . It is not surprised that we found MG was related with “ immune system disease ” ( DOID : 2914 ) . Ac - tually , MG is associated with various autoimmune dis - eases , including thyroid diseases [ 52 ] and lupus [ 53 ] . Thymoma ( DOID : 3275 ) was found as the strongest as - sociated partner of MG with a MedNetSim similarity up Table 2 Percentage of interaction pairs sharing GO annotation GO GO _ BP GO _ CC GO _ MF HumanNet 75 . 30 % 28 . 33 % 56 . 75 % 52 . 82 % hPPIN 89 . 28 % 38 . 52 % 71 . 96 % 73 . 94 % comPPI a 95 . 15 % 59 . 36 % 82 . 10 % 81 . 65 % GO Gene Ontology , GO _ BP biological process , GO _ CC cellular component , GO _ MF molecular function a The common protein - protein interactions between HumanNet and hPPIN Fig 8 An overview of disease similarity network ( DSN ) based on MedNetSim results .

BMC Bioinformatics ( 2016 ) 17 : 326 Page 10 of 13 to 0 . 181 ( p - value = 1 . 21 × 10 − 4 ) , and vice versa . The rela - tionship between thymic abnormalities and MG had also been reported [ 54 ] . Additionaly , MedNetSim can also be used to recognize new relatedness between diseases . Fibromyalgia ( DOID : 631 ) , belonging to the “ musculo - skeletal system disease ” ( DOID : 17 ) category , was taken as an example . As shown in Fig . 9b , fibromyalgia was as - sociated to several mental health diseases , e . g . , pain dis - order ( DOID : 0060164 ) , postpartum depression ( DOID : 9478 ) . Studies has shown that fibromyalgia is frequently associated with depression and chronic pain [ 55 ] . There were a few reports on the relatedness between fibro - myalgia and personality disorder ( DOID : 1510 ) [ 56 , 57 ] . However , fibromyalgia ’ s relationship with antisocial per - sonality disorder ( DOID : 10939 ) and avoidant personal - ity disorder ( DOID : 1509 ) are currently not reported . Interestingly , their associations were found in Fig . 9b . It was also found that melancholia ( DOID : 2848 ) was re - lated to fibromyalgia . Those new found relatedness be - tween diseases might deserve further research to understand their common pathophysiology and help drug repositioning research . Conclusions Methods based on protein interaction networks , litera - ture data ( MEDLINE ) , and their integration , were devel - oped to compute disease similarity ( NetSim , MedSim and MedNetSim ) . Taking advantage of the entire protein interaction network , NetSim obtained the best perform - ance in all function - based methods . Among semantic - based methods , the performance of MedSim achieved significantly better results . MedSim does not require prior knowledge of disease - associated genes , enabling it to have a wider range of application than the other methods . MedSim can be a great supplement to function - based algorithms , especially when there is not enough gene - disease association data . The further im - proved AUC of MedNetSim shows that integrating bio - medical literature and protein interaction data can be an effective way to improve computation for disease similarities . Quality of protein interaction data was found to be more important than its volume , while higher volume of gene - disease association data , even with lower reliability , is more beneficial for disease similarity computation . In a situation of limited resources , it maybe beneficial to put more efforts toward obtaining more gene - disease as - sociation data and improving the quality of protein - protein interaction network .
