The self - healing hydrogels based on 2 - ureido - 4 [ 1 H ] - pyrimidinone ( UPy ) have recently received extensive attention due to their dynamic reversibility of UPy dimerization . However , generally , UPy - based self - healing hydrogels exhibit poor stability , cannot degrade in vivo and can hardly be excreted from the body , which considerably limit their bio - application . Here , using poly ( l - glutamic acid ) ( PLGA ) as biodegradable matrix , branching α - hydroxy - ω - amino poly ( ethylene oxide ) ( HAPEO ) as bridging molecule to introduce UPy , and ethyl acrylate polyethylene glycol ( MAPEG ) to introduce double bond , the hydrogel precursors ( PMHU ) are prepared . A library of the self - healing hydrogels has been achieved with well self - healable and shear - thinning properties . With the increase of MAPEG grafting ratio , the storage modulus of the self - healing hydrogels decreases . The self - healing hydrogels are stable in solution only for 6 h , hard to meet the requirements of tissue regeneration . Consequently , ultraviolet ( UV ) photo - crosslinking is involved to obtain the dual crosslinking hydrogels with enhanced mechanical properties and stability . When MAPEG grafting ratio is 35 . 5 % , the dual crosslinking hydrogels can maintain the shape in phosphate - buffered saline solution ( PBS ) for at least 8 days . Loading with adipose - derived stem cell spheroids , the self - healing hydrogels are injected and self - heal to a whole , and then they are crosslinked in situ via UV - irradiation , obtaining the dual crosslinking hydrogels / cell spheroids complex with cell viability of 86 . 7 % ±6 . 0 % , which demonstrates excellent injectability , subcutaneous gelatinization , and biocompatibility of hydrogels as cell carriers . The novel PMHU hydrogels crosslinked by quadruple hydrogen bonding and then dual photo - crosslinking of double bond are expected to be applied for minimal invasive surgery or therapies in tissue engineering .

INTRODUCTION Self - healing hydrogels with the shear - thinning property are promising injectable materials , showing great advantages in minimally invasive treatment , filling irregular defects , and loading cells or drugs , which has attracted extensive attention in recent years . [ 1−3 ] Meanwhile , self - healing hydrogels have the ability to control the gelation rate on the basis of the shear - thinning property , avoiding the loss of loading cells / drugs or un - necessary premature gel formation before the sol - gel transition at the desired sites . [ 1 ] They could also prevent the cell spheroids from aggregation or sedimentation in liquid precursors or cell leakage after injecting into the body , [ 4 ] which are common issues of traditional injectable hydrogels . Compared with dynamic covalent cross - linked self - healing hydrogel , those constructed by noncovalent bonds usually undergo rapid sol - gel transition . [ 5 ] Among the physical interactions , hydrogen bonding is considered as a controllable force to construct self - healing hydrogels . The stability and mechanical properties of hydrogen - bonding self - healing hydrogels are tunable through changing the density or bonding strength of hydrogen bonds , [ 6 ] and can be enhanced by synergistic effects . [ 7 ] Ureido - 4 [ 1 H ] - pyrimidinone ( UPy ) has been widely studied in the past decades due to its ability of dimerization and self - assembly as a self - complementary quadruple hydrogen - bond unit . [ 8 , 9 ] The hydrogen bonding motif contains the sequence of DDAA ( D : Donor ; A : Accepter ) and has a favorable dimeriza - tion constant ( 10 9 L / mol ) in methylbenzene . [ 10 ] Currently , a library of UPy - based self - healing hydrogels with remarkable properties have been reported , including pH - responsive hy - drogels , [ 11 ] thermosensitive hydrogels , [ 12 ] and multi - stimulus response hydrogels . [ 13 ] But most of them are composed of nondegradable backbones , such as polyacrylates [ 14 ] and poly ( ethylene glycol ) ( PEG ) .

These limitations of applic - ation as tissue engineering materials invite the need to devel - op strategies to prepare injectable and biodegradable UPy - based hydrogels with good stability and mechanical proper - ties . By grafting the molecules containing unsaturated bonds onto the polymer backbones , dual crosslinking network is formed in the hydrogel with improved stability . This can not only keep the biofunctionalities of implanted materials , but also meet the in vivo requirements of biomedical engineering . Poly ( l - glutamic acid ) ( PLGA ) is a preeminently biodegrad - able and biocompatible polypeptide . Our group has used PLGA to prepare a series of tissue engineering scaffolds ap - plied to reconstruct the defect tissues , such as bulk hydro - gels , [ 16 ] injectable hydrogels , [ 17 ] microgels , [ 18 ] and non - immun - ogenicity . [ 16 , 18 ] Herein , in this study , UPy units were attached onto the PLGA through the connection agent of α - hydroxy - ω - amino poly ( ethylene oxide ) ( HAPEO ) , and methyl acrylate polyethyl - ene glycol ( MAPEG ) was introduced to the PLGA backbone to provide unsaturated bonds . The hydrogel precursor P ( LGA - co - ( LG - g - MAPEG ) - co - ( LG - g - HAPEO ) - co - ( LG - g - ( HAPEO - g - UPy ) ) ) was obtained and marked as PMHU . The self - healing hydro - gels were developed through the self - assembly of UPy di - mers as crosslinked blocks with well - performed self - healable and shear - thinning properties . Ultraviolet ( UV ) photo - cross - linking was utilized to acquire dual crosslinking hydrogels with enhanced stability and mechanical properties . The influ - ence of grafting ratio of MAPEG on shear - thinning and self - healable properties of the hydrogels was studied . To under - stand the effect of grafting ratio of MAPEG , the viscoelasticity of self - healing hydrogels and dual crosslinking hydrogels was investigated . Moreover , the impact of the grafting ratio of MAPEG on the stability of the dual crosslinking hydrogels was tested . With the aim of biomedical application , the cytocom - patibility of PMHU hydrogels was evaluated . Loading with adipose - derived stem cell spheroids , the self - healing hydro - gel was injected and then crosslinked in situ via UV - irradi - ation . Then , the obtained dual crosslinking hydrogels / cell spheroids complex showed ideal cell viability ( Scheme 1 ) . Consequently , we hypothesized the PMHU hydrogels might be the promising biomaterials for tissue engineering . EXPERIMENTAL Materials PLGA ( M n = 2 . 4×10 5 Da , PDI = 1 . 63 ) was synthesized in the lab of our research group .

The target product was extracted from the above solution with chloroform and then dried for 1 h with Na 2 SO 4 , followed by rotary evaporation . After precipitating in the diethyl ether , the amorphous white powder was obtained . The reaction yield was 73 . 1 % . Synthesis of 2 ( 6 - Isocyanato Hexyl Amino Carbonyl Amino ) - 6 - Methyl - 4 [ 1 H ] Pyrimidinone ( UPy - HDI ) Following the previous procedures , [ 15 ] UPy - HDI was successfully synthesized . After HDI ( 26 mL ) reacted with AHMP ( 2 . 91 g ) at 100 °C for 16 h under N 2 , the coarse product was obtained . After precipitating the coarse product into n - hexane , a white powder was acquired , and then dried in vacuum . The reaction yield was 98 . 0 % . Synthesis of MAPEG and HAPEO Grafted to PLGA ( P ( LGA - co - ( LG - g - MAPEG ) - co - ( LG - g - HAPEO ) ) , Marked as PMH ) MAPEG and HAPEO were simultaneously grafted to PLGA by car - bodiimide reaction . [ 21−23 ] Firstly , PLGA ( 0 . 20 g ) , MAPEG ( 0 . 88 g ) , and HAPEO ( 0 . 37 g ) were dissolved in 50 mL of DMSO . DMAP ( 0 . 05 g ) and EDC·HCl ( 0 . 15 g ) were added , followed with stirring the mixture for 24 h at 50 °C . After being dialyzed via deionized water for 7 days thoroughly , the resulting products were lyo - philized . The reaction yield was 75 . 4 % . The molar feed ratio of the carboxyl group from PLGA to MAPEG and HAPEO was fixed at 5 : 1 and 10 : 1 , matching with the calculated grafting ratios as 20 . 0 % and 10 . 0 % , respectively . The products were analyzed by proton nuclear magnetic resonance ( 1 H - NMR ) . The grafting ratios of MAPEG and HAPEO were 18 . 5 % and 9 . 3 % , marked as PMH - 1 . Fixing the calculated grafting ratios of HAPEO at 10 . 0 % , other grafting ratios of MAPEG , 30 . 0 % , 40 . 0 % , 50 . 0 % , and 60 . 0 % , were carried out according to the similar procedures . Synthesis of UPy Modified PMH ( PMHU ) PMH - 1 ( 0 . 50 g ) was reacted with UPy - HDI ( 0 . 08 g ) in DMF ( 96 mL ) at 90 °C for 24 h under N 2 . After precipitating the mixture in diethyl ether , a white amorphous solid was obtained and then dried in vacuum . Analyzed and calculated by 1 H - NMR , the grafting ratio of UPy was 3 . 3 % , marked as PMHU - 1 . The polymers produced by other molar ratios were synthesized based on the similar procedures . Characterizations of Polymers 1 H - NMR spectra of PLGA , UPy - HDI , and PMHU were acquired utilizing NMR spectroscopy ( AV 500 MHz , Bruker , U . S . A . ) to calculate the grafting ratios of MAPEG , HAPEO , and UPy . The dissolution reagent was deuterated water ( D 2 O ) . Infrared spectroscopy ( IR ) spectra of PLGA , UPy - HDI , and PMHU were recorded on Fourier infrared spectrometer ( Avatar 370 , Nicolet , U . S . A . ) . The mixed powder of the dried sample and KBr was pressed into a sheet and tested in a scanning wavenumber range of 500−4000 cm −1 . Preparation of Self - healing Hydrogels PMHU ( 0 . 10 g ) , phosphate - buffered saline solution ( PBS ) ( 0 . 90 mL ) , and I2959 ( 2 . 00 mg , 2 mg / mL ) were mixed , generating the hydrogel with a mass concentration of 10 . 0 wt % . Preparation of Dual Crosslinking Hydrogels Self - healing hydrogels were transformed into dual crosslinking hydrogels after 5 min of UV irradiation . UV lamp ( Zigoo , Beijing Worlda Glass Tools Co . , Ltd . , China ) was utilized to provide UV irradiation in the experiments . UV intensity was 200 mW / cm 2 , and the UV light wavelength was 365 nm . Rheological Behaviors of Hydrogels Through the oscillatory mode on the rheometer ( DHR , TA , U . S . A . ) , rheological properties of hydrogels were examined at 37 °C . To evaluate viscoelastic behaviors of hydrogels , freque - ncy spectrum experiment was operated at the 10 % settled regular strain and the 0 . 1−100 rad / s angular frequency range . The alternate strain test was operated to research the self - healing properties , of which the large strain was 200 % and the small strain was 1 % . Viscosity - shear rate test was carried out to verify the shear - thinning property , and the shear rate was 0 . 001−100 s −1 . Stability and Biodegradability of Hydrogels Hydrogels were transferred into vials filled with PBS and put in the 37 °C incubator . PBS was refreshed every 24 h . After specific time points , the hydrogels were rinsed by deionized water . The wet weight was measured via the analytical balance with the accuracy of 0 . 10 mg after blotting hydrogels’ surface with filter paper . The mass of the vial was denoted as W vial . The overall mass of the vial and the hydrogel was denoted as W all . The overall mass of the vial and the wet weight denoted as W wet . The mass - loss rate ( R ) of the hydrogel could be calculated by the formula : R = ( W wet − W all ) / ( W all − W vial ) , which was computed to quantify the degradation of the hydrogel . Cytotoxicity Test Before the cytotoxicity study , the materials were disinfected and sterilized . Rabbit adipose stem cells ( rASCs ) were inoculated with the cell density of 4×10 4 cells / 200 μ L solution of Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium ( DMEM ) but 20 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) in 96 - well plates , followed with all - night culture . Different concentrations of I2959 ( 0 . 08−10 . 67 mg / mL ) and different concentrations of hydrogel precursor of ( 0 . 53−67 . 33 mg / mL ) with I2959 ( 1 mg / mL ) were incubated with 5 % CO 2 , and DMEM was specified to be a control group . The concentrations were based on the max mass concentration of materials as 1 . 50 % . After 24 - h culture , the methyl thiazolyltetrazolium ( MTT ) solution was then added to each and every well , followed with another 4 - h culturing . Absorbance ( A ) was measured on the SpectraMax M2 microplate reader from Molecular Devices in triplicate . Hence , cell survival rate = A sample / A control . Preparation of Cell Spheroids Polyethylene glycol diacrylate ( PEGDA , 0 . 400 g ) and photo - initiator I2959 ( 0 . 025 g ) were dissolved in 5 mL of DMSO . After UV irradiation in a glass plate ( diameter 2 . 00 cm ) for 15 min , the gel formed . To prepare PEG hydrogel , DMSO was then replaced with PBS immersion . Before cell inoculation , the hydrogel was sterilized in ethanol for 12 h and then immersed in PBS . rASCs were inoculated on the surface of hydrogel ( cell inoculation density was 1 . 6×10 5 / cm 2 ) and cultured for 24 h to obtain cell spheroids in a specific size ( 100 . 0−200 . 0 μ m ) . Minimally Invasive Injection Assay and Cell Spheroid Viability in Hydrogels After cell spheroids were collected , 1 mL of self - healing hydrogel with a mass concentration of 10 . 0 % was added . Cell spheroids were dispersed evenly in self - healing hydrogels by Shi , Z . et al . / Chinese J . Polym .

The hydrogel loaded with cell spheroids was put into a 1 mL sterile syringe and injected into a culture dish by the 18G needle ( outside diameter = 1 . 2 mm , injection speed = 0 . 2 mL / s ) . After injecting , the complex of PMHU hydrogels loaded with cell spheroids self - healed to an integrated gel . Then , the dual crosslinking hydrogels / cell spheroids complex was obtained by secondary photo - crosslinking under UV irradiation for 5 min . The cell spheroids encapsulated in self - healing hydrogel and dual crosslinking hydrogel were cultivated respectively in the live / dead cell double staining kit for 30 min . Then , the cell spheroids were observed with a laser confocal microscope . The fluorescence area was calculated by the fluorescence analysis software Image J . Statistical Analysis All of the experimental data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation ( SD ) . Sample size ( n ) represented the number of biological replicates ( n ≥ 3 ) . Before performing a statistical test , normality and variance were checked equal . Single - factor analysis for variance ( ANOVA ) was employed to evaluate the statistical significance , and then Tukey’s test was used for multiple comparisons . When the significance criterion ( p value ) was lower than 0 . 05 , the difference of the experimental data was considered to be statistically significant ( * , p < 0 . 05 ) . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Synthesis and Characterization of PMHU The carboxyl groups of PLGA was activated by 4 - dimethylam - inopyridine ( DMAP ) and 1 - ethyl - 3 - dimethylaminopropyl carbo - diimide hydrochloride ( EDC·HCl ) and reacted with MAPEG and HAPEO to produce the intermediate P ( LGA - co - ( LG - g - MAPEG ) - co - ( LG - g - HAPEO ) ) ( marked as PMH ) . By the nucleophilic addition reaction via the hydroxyl group of PMH and the isocyanate group of 2 ( 6 - isocyanato hexyl amino carbonyl amino ) - 6 - methyl - 4 [ 1 H ] pyrimidinone ( UPy - HDI ) , the hydrogel precursor PMHU was prepared . The synthetic route of PMHU is exhibited in Fig . S1a ( in the electronic supplementary information , ESI ) . The grafting ratios of MAPEG , HAPEO , and UPy in hydrogel precursors PMHU are listed in Table S1 ( ESI ) . In consideration of the water solubility of the hydrogel precursor , the graft ra - tio of HAPEO was fixed at 10 . 0 % , and the graft ratio of UPy was selected to be 3 . 0 % . Proton nuclear magnetic resonance ( 1 H - NMR ) spectra of PLGA , UPy - HDI , and PMHU - 1 are shown in Fig . S1 ( b ) ( in ESI ) . The single peak at δ H = 4 . 9 ppm was the chemical shift of proton at the double bond in MAPEG , and the single peak at δ H = 4 . 1 ppm corresponded to the chemical shift of proton at the tertiary carbon in PLGA . The single peak at δ H = 3 . 2 ppm represented the active proton at the methyl - ene group in HAPEO . Calculated through peak integration , the grafting ratio of MAPEG and HAPEO was 18 . 5 % and 9 . 3 % , which were closed to the theoretical grafting ratio of 20 . 0 % and 10 . 0 % , respectively . The signals at δ H = 5 . 7 ppm corres - ponded to the protons of UPy and the areas of peak represen - ted the grafting ratio of UPy units ( 3 . 3 % ) . The other grafting ratios of MAPEG in PMHU were 25 . 9 % , 35 . 5 % , 45 . 2 % , and 52 . 9 % , and all of them were lower than the theoretical graft ratios , which might be caused by reaction steric hindrance . [ 24 ] The 1 H - NMR spectra of all hydrogel precursors PMHU are shown in Fig . S2 ( in ESI ) . The representative infrared spectroscopy ( IR ) spectra of PMHU - 1 are presented in Fig . S1 ( c ) ( in ESI ) . The absorption at 3300 cm −1 on the spectra was from the stretching vibration of the nitrogen - hydrogen bond ( N ― H ) on the secondary amine on PLGA . The absorption at 2800 cm −1 was ascribed to the oxygen - hydrogen bond ( O ― H ) stretching vibration of PLGA’s residual carboxyl group . The characteristic band appearing at 1680 cm −1 was ascribed to the carbonyl group ( C ＝ O ) stretch - ing vibration on the amide bond . The absorption at 1465 and 1150 cm −1 corresponded to the carbon - hydrogen bond ( C ― H ) bending vibration on the methylene group in the PEG structural unit as well as the stretching vibration of the ether bond ( C ― O ― C ) . From the following spectra , there was no isocyanate ( ― N ＝ C ＝ O ) stretching vibration absorption band at 2250 cm −1 , indicating that almost all of the hydroxyl group of PMH and the isocyanate group of UPy participated in the nucleophilic addition reaction . This proved that UPy units were successfully grafted onto the PMH backbone . Preparation and Characterization of Self - healing Hydrogels Preparation of self - healing hydrogels The self - healing hydrogels were manufactured via the self - assembly of hydrogel precursor PMHU in aqueous solution . The driving force was the dimerization of UPy units , which formed the reversible noncovalent crosslinked networks . For self - heal - ing hydrogels , the gelatinizing property of different hydrogel precursors PMHU is shown in Fig . 1 , all of which could form hydrogels except PMHU - 5 ( 52 . 9 % of MAPEG grafting ratio ) . The possible reason was that as the grafting ratio of MAPEG gradually increased from 18 . 5 % to 52 . 9 % , the hydrophilicity of the precursor polymer steadily increased . When the grafting ratio of MAPEG was 52 . 9 % , the precursor PMHU - 5 was too hydrophilic to form a hydrogel because water molecules would interfere with hydrogen bond accumulation of UPy . [ 14 ] Also , the increased grafting ratio of side chains might enhance the steric hindrance of the multiple - hydrogel - bond assay . [ 25 ] Measurement of self - healable and shear - thinning properties The dimerization of UPy units is a dynamic reversible process in aqueous solution , [ 26 ] which can endow hydrogels with self - healable and shear - thinning properties . ( Fig . 2a ) . When hydro - gels deform , weaker bonds in the hydrogel network , such as noncovalent bonds , will be broken as sacrificial bonds .

When the residual supramolecular crosslinking is insufficient to support the hydrogel network , the solid - state gel is converted into the liquid state . [ 4 ] This point is considered as the gel - sol conversion point ( i . e . the storage modulus ( G ′ ) = the loss modulus ( G ″ ) ) . To understand the relationship between the grafting ratio of MAPEG and the gel - sol conversion point , the rheological properties of PMHU self - healing hydrogels were investigated . The mass concentration of all hydrogel precursor was 10 . 0 % . When the grafting ratio of MAPEG was 18 . 5 % , 25 . 9 % , 35 . 5 % , and 45 . 2 % , the gel - sol conversion point was 20 . 1 % , 90 . 0 % , 20 . 1 % , and 12 . 6 % , respectively ( Fig . 2b ) . The transition point of the self - healing hydrogels increased at first and then decreased with the upregulation of the grafting ratio of MAPEG . The results demonstrated that when the grafting rate of MAPEG was 18 . 5 % , the hydrophilic part was weaker than the hydrophobic self - assembly aggregations derived from the dimerization of UPy units in the hydrogel , leading to heterogeneities in hydrogel network ; [ 27 ] thus other properties of this hydrogel would not be discussed further . When the grafting ratio of MAPEG increased to 25 . 9 % , the hydrophilicity of the hydrogel precursor was im - proved ; meanwhile , the density of aggregation in the hydrogel network decreased . The hydrogel network tended to be homo - geneous , so the hydrogel showed enhanced damage resistance . However , when the grafting ratio of MAPEG further increased , the optimal balance between the hydrophilic part and hydro - phobic aggregations in the hydrogel network was disrupted , and the hydrophilicity of the hydrogel further increased . Steric hindrance [ 25 ] and water molecules [ 14 ] interference broke UPy - stacked hydrogen bonds , showing lower conversion points . [ 27 ] To quantify the self - healable and shear - thinning abilities as well as subsequent self - recovery of the hydrogels , the rhe - ological behaviors were measured by alternating strain tests based on the gel - sol transition point of each hydrogel , from the strain of 1 % to 200 % . The mass concentration of all hydro - gel precursor was 10 . 0 % . When the strain was 1 % , the G ′ was higher than the G ″ , and the hydrogel was in the gel state . While the strain switched to 200 % , the G ′ was lower than the G ″ , and the hydrogel was converted into the liquid state . After multiple cycles , the hydrogels at different grafting ratios of MAPEG maintained their initial mechanical properties ( Fig . 2c ) , indicating that the hydrogels showed good self - heal - ing capabilities at different grafting ratios of MAPEG . Shear - thinning means that the weaker bonds in hydrogels are temporarily destroyed when the shear rate or shear force increases , and the viscosity of hydrogels decreases sharply . [ 28 ] As the shear rate and force continue to increase , the viscosity of hydrogel gradually decreases and eventually flattens , showing a liquid - state viscosity . [ 29 , 30 ] The influence of the grafting ratio of MAPEG ( PMHU - 2 : 25 . 9 % , PMHU - 3 : 35 . 5 % , and PMHU - 4 : 45 . 2 % ) on shear - thinning properties of UPy - based hydrogels is shown in Fig . 3 ( a ) . The self - healing hydrogels cor - responding to each grafting ratio of MAPEG had a tendency that the viscosity dropped sharply at a low shear rate , indicat - ing that UPy dimers’ disassociation in hydrogels occurred and the hydrogels showed well shear - thinning property . At the same shear rate ( 0 . 001−0 . 01 s −1 ) , as the grafting ratio in - creased , the viscosity of the hydrogels decreased , similar to the conversion points tendency . Shear - thinning is conducive to the injection of hydrogels . [ 28 ] As shown in Fig . 3 ( b ) , the UPy - based self - healing hydrogels could be injected into vari - ous shapes easily and could be used for minimally invasive in - jection . Viscoelasticity of self - healing hydrogels Hydrogels are space - filling materials used in tissue engineering , and their mechanical properties ( e . g . viscoelasticity ) are signi - ficant evaluation factors for cell adhesion , proliferation , and differentiation . Besides , mechanical property plays an auxiliary role in tissue regeneration . [ 31−33 ] The effect of grafting ratio of MAPEG on the viscoelastic behaviors of UPy - based hydrogels is shown in Fig . 4 . When the grafting ratio of MAPEG in the self - healing hydrogels was 25 . 9 % , 35 . 5 % , and 45 . 2 % ( corresponding to PMHU - 2 , PMHU - 3 , PMHU - 4 ) , the G ′ was 1238 . 4 , 1044 . 7 , and 688 . 6 Pa , respectively , with a 10 rad / s angular frequency . The G ′ of the self - healing hydrogels reduced with the upregulation of the grafting ratio of MAPEG . The reason might be related to the balance of hydrophilic and hydrophobic segments . The results indicated that when the grafting rate of MAPEG was 25 . 9 % , the hydrophilicity from the PEG chain segment and the hydrophobicity from the crosslinked point in hydrogel reached the optimal balance . [ 27 ] When the grafting rate of MAPEG further increased , the content of the hydrophilic chain segment incre - ased . The best balance between hydrophobic aggregations and hydrophilic part in the hydrogel network was broken ; conse - quently , water molecules were more likely to interfere with hy - b a 10 −2 10 −1 10 0 10 1 10 2 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 PMHU - 2 PMHU - 3 PMHU - 4 V i s c o s i t y ( k P a · s ) Shear rate ( s −1 ) Fig . 3 ( a ) Influence of grafting ratio of MAPEG on shear - thinning properties of self - healing hydrogels ; ( b ) Feasibility of self - healing hydrogels injection . 332 Shi , Z . et al . / Chinese J .

[ 14 ] Additionally , with the influence of steric hindrance , [ 25 ] the mechanical properties gradually decreased . Preparation and Characterization of Dual Crosslinking Hydrogels Preparation of dual crosslinking hydrogels The UPy - based hydrogels had excellent self - healing and shear - thinning properties via multiple - hydrogen - bond interactions and UPy dimerization . Nevertheless , while UPy dimers were transferred to solution , the strength and stability of hydrogen bonds undermined , leading to a weak and unstable hydrogel . The UPy - based hydrogels were steady in solution only for 6 h , far less than the required time of implanted materials ( Fig . S3 in ESI ) . Therefore , for further stability improvement , the unsatu - rated bonds were incorporated to the UPy - based hydrogel to introduce the secondary crosslinking . After the activation of photo - initiator ( i . e . 2 - hydroxy - 4 - ( 2 - hydroxy - ethoxy ) - 2 - methyl - propiophenone ( I2959 ) ) at 5 - min UV irradiation , the self - healing hydrogels were transformed into dual crosslinking hydrogels by photo - crosslinking of pendant methacrylate . Viscoelasticity of dual crosslinking hydrogels As shown in Fig . 5 , the impact of the grafting ratio of MAPEG on the viscoelastic properties of dual crosslinking hydrogels was studied . The dual crosslinking hydrogels with MAPEG grafting ratios of 25 . 9 % , 35 . 5 % , and 45 . 2 % ( corresponding to PMHU - 2 , PMHU - 3 , and PMHU - 4 ) had G ′ values of 1614 . 3 , 1562 . 1 , and 786 . 1 Pa , respectively . The G ′ attenuated with the increase of the MAPEG grafting ratio , which was caused by the double bond crosslinking as well as the synergistic effect of hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions . Compared with the corresponding self - healing hydrogels , the G ′ of all dual crosslinking hydrogels increased , indicating the introduction of the dual network improved the mechanical properties . Stability and degradation of dual crosslinking hydrogels In tissue engineering , the stability of hydrogels is as important as the mechanical property of hydrogels . In the early stage of tissue repair , hydrogels can provide an advantageous micro - environment for cell proliferation and differentiation , and also maintain the three - dimensional ( 3 - D ) structure of the new tissue in aqueous solution . [ 28 ] The hydrogels should be stable during this period . Along with the further growth of new tissues , the temporary template is desired to erode or degrade in vivo , to make a place for tissue growth . [ 4 , 34 , 35 ] Thus , the investigation of stability and degradation of hydrogels is necessary . Under simulated physiological conditions ( phosphate - buffered saline solution ( PBS ) , 37 °C ) , the stability and degradation of the dual crosslinking hydrogels were evaluated in vitro . [ 36 ] As revealed in Fig . 6 , water absorption and swelling of the dual crosslinking hydrogels PMHU - 3 and PMHU - 4 occurred for 1 day due to the higher content of PEG segment . Since the dual crosslinking hydrogels PMHU - 2 had a low PEG segment content , there was no apparent swelling . The dual crosslink - ing hydrogel PMHU - 3 , immersed in PBS , could maintain the shape for 8 days . This period is sufficient for cell induction and differentiation ( generally 7 days ) . [ 16 , 21 , 37 ] Meanwhile , com - pared with self - healing hydrogels , the stability of dual cross - linking hydrogels was enhanced significantly , demonstrating the introduction of the secondary covalent crosslinking net - work improved the stability of hydrogels regardless of soak - ing in solution . The biodegradation of dual crosslinking hydrogels was evidently relative to the grafting ratio of MAPEG . The dual crosslinking hydrogel with the MAPEG grafting ratio of 35 . 5 % ( PMHU - 3 ) showed the slowest degradation rate among the hydrogels in PBS . When the dual crosslinking hydrogels with the MAPEG grafting ratio of 25 . 9 % ( PMHU - 2 ) and 45 . 2 % ( PM - HU - 4 ) immersed in PBS for 19 days , the degradation was al - most completed , while PMHU - 3 dual crosslinking hydrogel still maintained 18 . 9 % ±13 . 0 % . The MAPEG grafting ratio - de - pendent degradation behaviors made it possible to meet various requirements for tissue engineering , in which case an interim carrier typically needed days or even weeks . Biocompatibility of the hydrogels The dynamic and reversible crosslinking endowed the self - healing hydrogels with both shear - thinning and excellent self - healable properties , which made it possible to apply the self - healing hydrogels as injectable cell carriers for minimally invasive implantation . Additionally , stable and biodegradable dual crosslinking hydrogels were obtained in situ through photo - crosslinking for further tissue regeneration , which provided an ideal biomaterial for tissue engineering .

Polym .

Simultan - eously , for reducing the error , rASCs fostered in DMSO was set as the positive control . As seen in Fig . 7 ( a ) , cell activity de - creased gradually from 89 . 3 % ±3 . 2 % to 21 . 9 % ±0 . 8 % with the increase of I2959 concentration from 0 . 08 mg / mL to 10 . 67 mg / mL . In the fabrication of the dual crosslinking hy - drogels , the concentration of I2959 was 1 mg / mL . The relat - ive viabilities of rASCs in the mixture of hydrogel precursor and I2959 were between 159 . 7 % ±10 . 1 % and 355 . 4 % ±11 . 2 % at a wide range of concentrations ( Fig . 7b ) , which showed the superior cytocompatibility . Compared with monodisperse cells , cell spheroids are mul - ticellular aggregates ( Fig . S4 in ESI ) , which have a stronger resistance to harsh external environments [ 38 ] and more ad - vantages in cell differentiation . [ 24 ] Therefore , cell spheroids were encapsulated in PMHU hydrogels instead of single rASCs . The feasibility of minimally invasive implantation and biocompatibility of secondary photo - crosslinking process by UV irradiation were verified . The hydrogel precursor PMHU - 3 was used to fabricate the self - healing hydrogel , and then it was evenly mixed with cell spheroids ( cell spheroids density : 5×10 5 / mL ) . The self - healing hydrogel / cell spheroids complex was easily injected into a Petri dish through the 18G needle and then joined to form an integrated gel , indicating that the cell spheroids did not interrupt the self - healable or shear - thinning properties of the hydrogel . Afterwards , the dual crosslinking hydrogel / cell spheroids complex was obtained by 5 - min UV illumination . Through the fluorescence images of cell spheroids in the hydrogel ( Figs . 7c and 7d ) , the cell survival rate in the self - healing hydrogel and dual crosslinking hydrogel was 98 . 0 % ±10 . 0 % and 86 . 7 % ±6 . 0 % ( Fig . 7e ) , respectively , which illustrated that apoptosis oc - curred during the UV illumination . This result suggested that the dual crosslinking hydrogel preserved most of the spher - oids ( 86 . 7 % ±6 . 0 % survived ) , which would be a promising ma - terial for tissue engineering . CONCLUSIONS In summary , through grafting UPy moieties onto the PLGA backbone via the connection agent of HAPEO , and introducing MAPEG into the PLGA backbone to provide unsaturated bonds , a novel hydrogel system was successfully fabricated . The PMHU self - healing hydrogels displayed well shear - thinning as well as self - healable properties as a result of the transient network , which could meet convenient injection . The G ′ of the self - healing hydrogels decreased with the upregulation of the grafting ratio of MAPEG because of the balance of hydrophobic and hydrophilic segment as well as the influence of steric hindrance . However , the self - healing hydrogels could be steady in solution only for 6 h . The UV photo - crosslinking was then introduced to obtain dual crosslinking hydrogels for further stability improvement . In the same proportion , the G ′ of dual crosslinking hydrogels was increased compared with the corresponding self - healing hydrogels . The improved mecha - nical property was attributed to the dual network derived from photo - crosslinking . The properties of hydrogels could be adjusted by controlling the proportion of MAPEG . When the graft ratio of MAPEG was 35 . 5 % , the PMHU - 3 dual crosslinking hydrogel showed the optimal stability and moderative degrad - ation , which could be stable for at least 8 days in PBS . The PMHU - 3 self - healing hydrogel loaded with rASCs cell spheroids was injected conveniently , and then through photo - crosslinking , the stable and biodegradable dual crosslinking hydrogel / cell spheroids complex was obtained in situ . Moreover , it showed favourable biocompatibility with a cell survival rate of 86 . 7 % ±6 . 0 % . This novel hydrogel system can be used for minimally invasive implantation as injectable cell carriers and further tissue regeneration in situ , which will have broad applications in tissue engineering . Therefore , we expect that the PMHU hydrogels can be the promising tissue engineering biomaterials .
