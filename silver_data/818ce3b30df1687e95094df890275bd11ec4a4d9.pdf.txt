Loop extrusion is an attractive model for bringing genetic elements together , but how this functionally interacts with transcription is also largely unknown . We combine live tracking of genomic loci and nascent transcripts with molecular dynamics simulations to assess the 4D arrangement of the Sox2 gene and its enhancer , in response to a battery of perturbations . We find that alterations in chromatin mobility , not promoter - enhancer distance , is more informative about transcriptional status . Active elements display more constrained mobility , consistent with confinement within specialized nuclear sites , and alterations in enhancer mobility distinguish poised from transcribing alleles . Strikingly , we find that whereas loop extrusion and transcription factor - mediated clustering contribute to promoter - enhancer proximity , they have antagonistic effects on chromatin dynamics . This provides an experimental framework for the underappreciated role of chromatin dynamics in genome regulation . Keywords : Chromatin dynamics , enhancer , transcription , anomalous diffusion , molecular dynamics , live imaging . INTRODUCTION Metazoan gene expression is finely controlled by regulatory inputs from promoter sequences and distal regulatory elements , such as enhancers . How these dispersed elements are spatiotemporally coordinated to determine transcriptional output has been a topic of intense study , but key questions remain unresolved 1 , 2 . For example , most chromosome conformation capture - based experiments support a model where distal enhancers require close spatial proximity to target genes to confer activation 3 - 5 , often presumed via chromatin “looping” , and engineered promoter - enhancer contacts have been shown to stimulate expression 6 . However , recent imaging experiments at different loci have shown clear physical 3 separation of enhancers and active genes ( often in the order of ~ 200 - 300 nm ) , with conflicting results as to whether their separation decreases 7 , 8 , stays the same 9 or may actually increase 10 on transcriptional activation . The identification of nuclear clusters of lineage - specific transcription factors 11 , 12 , RNA polymerase II ( PolII ) 13 , 14 , and genes and regulatory elements themselves 15 - 19 has led to the proposal that transcription is organized into specialized nuclear microenvironments or “hubs” 20 . In this model , high local concentrations of regulatory factors accumulate near genomic sequences that are loosely co - associated ; the shared location of regulatory elements within this microenvironment is more important for transcriptional regulation than their direct physical juxtaposition . These hubs are potentially built up through specific protein - protein interactions and / or phase - separated condensate formation between intrinsically disordered domains found on many transcription factors 12 , 21 . How genes and distal regulatory elements locate or nucleate such hubs , and how the different regulatory inputs are coordinated into a transcriptional decision within , remain open questions . An often - overlooked aspect determining how regulatory chromatin architectures are built or maintained is the underlying mobility ( and freedom of movement ) of the component factors . Whereas non - histone chromatin proteins , including transcription factors , are highly mobile in the nucleoplasm 22 , the large polymeric chromatin fiber has more constrained movement , due to a crowded environment and elastic interactions with neighboring segments of the polymer 23 . This is often characterized as sub - diffusive movement , whereby the mean squared displacement ( MSD ) of the genomic element follows the relationship with time , t : MSD ∝ Dt α where D is the diffusion coefficient ( a proxy for diffusive speed ) and α , the anomalous exponent , is smaller than the value of 1 found in classical Brownian diffusion . Initial studies of randomly inserted tags suggested that heterochromatin was inherently less mobile than euchromatin in yeast 24 , but we recently reported significant locus - specific differences in chromatin diffusive properties at euchromatic regions in mouse embryonic stem cells ( ESCs ) , suggesting finer - scale modulation of chromatin dynamics , potentially linked to underlying function 25 . As methods for tracking specific genomic regions in vivo has recently become available , researchers have asked whether the 4 transcriptional activity of genes affects their mobility . We previously showed that an estrogen - inducible transgene could only explore a much smaller nuclear volume on acute induction , and that this constraint was dependent on transcriptional initiation 26 , consistent with a model whereby the activated gene becomes confined within a transcriptional hub . This is supported by analogous studies showing slowed movement of the pluripotency gene Nanog when transcriptionally active 27 and global enhanced chromatin mobility on treatment with transcriptional inhibitors 28 , 29 . However , mobility of the Oct4 gene was found to be insensitive to transcriptional status 27 , and a different study of transition between ESCs and epiblast - like cells reported acceleration of both promoters and enhancer - proximal sequences specific to the cell state where the elements are active 30 . A clear understanding of how transcriptional events modulate chromatin dynamics ( or vice versa ) is thus still lacking . At a larger scale , promoter - enhancer communication takes place within the context of topologically associated domains ( TADs ) , regions of enhanced intra - domain chromatin contacts identified in population - average Hi - C maps 31 , 32 , which have been proposed to prevent inappropriate promoter - enhancer communication across TAD borders , and / or to reduce the effective search space for enhancers to co - associate with target genes 1 , 33 - 35 . The major mechanism believed to organize TAD architecture is loop extrusion by SMC protein complexes , particularly cohesin ( reviewed in ref . 36 , and references therein ) . Cohesin loads on chromatin , extrudes loops of the chromatin fiber ( mostly bidirectionally ) , and is dissociated by the factor WAPL to generate metastable chromatin loops in an equilibrium . Sites where loop extrusion are stalled , particularly the juxtaposition of convergently facing sites for the factor CTCF ( CCCTC - binding factor ) , whose N - terminus specifically interacts with the cohesin complex 37 , form the bases of more stabilized loops at TAD borders . These are observed in Hi - C maps 38 , although recent live imaging experiments have revealed these to also be relatively rare and transient interactions in individual cells 39 , 40 . The so - called “architectural interactions” brought about by convergent CTCF sites have been proposed to facilitate juxtaposition of adjacent promoters and enhancers 41 , and loop extrusion has also been shown to be required for efficient activity of more distal , as opposed to proximal , enhancers 42 , 43 . 5 Further , recent simulations and experimental results show that cohesin - mediated loop extrusion generally reduces chromatin mobility 28 , 40 , perhaps further “stabilizing” such genomic configurations . However , we and others have observed extensive persistence of promoter - enhancer interactions when CTCF and / or cohesin is ablated 44 - 46 . This latter finding is reminiscent of the apparent competition that exists between TADs and chromosome compartmentation ( higher - order co - associations between domains of homotypic chromatin , such as active with active ) : cohesin ablation eliminates TADs , but appears to strengthen compartments 47 , 48 . The exact mechanisms promoting chromosome compartmentation genome - wide are unclear , but since co - association of active domains appears to depend on transcription itself 49 and transcription co - factors like BRD2 50 , it is reasonable to hypothesize that these could be the same biochemical principles involved in clustering transcription factors and active elements at proposed transcriptional hubs , raising the curious possibility that loop extrusion may sometimes antagonize such nuclear microenvironments . To assess more closely the interplay of enhancer activity , transcription and cohesin - mediated loop extrusion on the spatiotemporal organization of gene regulation , we tagged the promoter and major enhancer ( SCR ; Sox2 control region ) of the pluripotency gene Sox2 in mouse ESCs , in combination with detection of nascent transcription from the same allele , for their tracking at high temporal resolution . With a battery of genetic and other experimental perturbations , we confirmed the decoupling of transcription and promoter - enhancer proximity that was previously described at this locus 9 , 44 , 46 , and also found a hitherto unappreciated localized effect of transcription on chromatin dynamics . Promoter kinetics are disrupted on severe transcriptional inhibition , but when comparing transcriptionally bursting and “poised” Sox2 alleles , it is the enhancer which specifically becomes less mobile on gene firing . Most strikingly , we observed that deleting either CTCF or transcription factor binding sites induced opposing effects on localized chromatin mobility . In addition , molecular dynamics simulations were able to recapitulate these experimental findings only when competition between loop extrusion and transcription - linked enhancer - promoter communication was reinforced , suggesting they may be antagonistic processes on chromatin 6 dynamics , even though from a population - average viewpoint they are assumed to mediate the same interaction . These findings unify some of the seemingly conflicting results from previous studies and highlight the pitfalls of relying solely on population - averaged experiments on fixed cells to draw conclusions about a dynamic process such as spatiotemporal gene regulation . RESULTS Enhancer - promoter proximity is frequently maintained at the Sox2 locus independent of transcription To follow promoter - enhancer communication in living cells , we tagged the Sox2 promoter and SCR with orthologous parS sites ( ANCHOR1 and ANCHOR3 ) in the musculus allele of F1 ( Mus musculus 129 × Mus castaneus ) hybrid ESCs ( we term this line Sox2 - SCR WT ) , enabling their visualization on transfection with plasmids encoding fluorescently labeled ParB proteins 26 , 51 . The small size ( ~ 1 kb ) of the parS sequences allowed us to place the tags very close to the promoter ( 5 . 5 kb upstream of the TSS ) and actually inside the SCR , in between the elements known to control Sox2 transcription 44 , facilitating direct imaging of the promoter and enhancer themselves . As a control , we also generated an ESC line ( Inter - Down ) with parS integration sites shifted by ~ 60 kb , allowing visualization of non - regulatory loci with equivalent genomic separation ( Fig 1a , b ) . Allele - specific qRT - PCR showed that neither integration of the parS sites , nor their binding by transfected ParB proteins , affected Sox2 expression in cis ( Fig 1c ) . Cell cycle progression and expression of other pluripotency markers was similarly unaffected by the parS / ParB system ( Fig S1a , b ) . Further , allele - specific 4C - seq showed that Sox2 - SCR interaction strength was also unaltered by parS integration and ParB binding ( Fig 1d ) , strongly suggesting that the imaging setup has negligible functional impact on the loci that are visualized in this study . For these two ESC lines , we imaged the labeled loci at high temporal resolution ( 500 ms per frame ) in 2D with spinning disk confocal microscopy , using a set of optimized affine transformations to correct for chromatic aberrations and control for camera misalignment . Further enhancement of spot 7 centroid localization was performed by fitting a 2D Gaussian shape to a precision of ~ 30 nm 25 . In line with previous high - throughput DNA FISH studies 52 , 53 , median inter - probe distances demonstrated a large cell - to - cell heterogeneity , varying from 69 - 286 nm ( n = 72 ) for Sox2 - SCR distances and from 71 - 426 nm ( n = 49 ) for the control regions ( Fig 1e ; Table S1 ) . Over the short periods over which images were acquired , separation distances were relatively stable ( median absolute deviation 30 - 107 nm ; inter - decile range 74 - 293 nm ) . As may be expected from ESC Hi - C maps , the median distance between Sox2 and the SCR ( 164 nm ) is significantly smaller than the control regions of equivalent genomic separation ( 187 nm ; p = 0 . 036 ; Wilcoxon rank sum test ) . The Sox2 - SCR separation distances we measured agree very well with the 2D distances measured in the wild - type Sox2 locus in recent multiplexed DNA FISH studies 53 ( median 160 nm ; p = 0 . 78 ; Wilcoxon rank sum test ) ( Fig S2a ) . Although this implies that the parS / ParB system does not perturb endogenous chromosomal locus configurations within the nucleus , the ANCHOR1 - tagged control region downstream of the SCR was not included in the multiplexed DNA FISH design . We therefore performed 3D DNA FISH in wild - type F1 and ANCHOR - labeled Sox2 - SCR WT ESCs , using fosmid probes covering the locations of each of the parS integration sites , further confirming that average Sox2 - SCR separation distances are smaller than the control regions ( p < 2 . 2x10 - 16 ; Wilcoxon rank sum test ) , and that ANCHOR labeling has negligible effects on underlying chromatin organization ( p = 0 . 14 ; Wilcoxon rank sum test ) ( Fig S2b , c ) . We note that a previous study using Tet - and Cu - repeat operators to label regions a little further upstream of the Sox2 promoter and downstream of the SCR measured significantly larger distances ( median 221 nm ; p = 5 . 4x10 - 8 ; Wilcoxon rank sum test ) than obtained with either ANCHOR or DNA FISH in untagged loci 9 ( Fig S2a ) . This suggests that , at least for this locus , the repetitive operator system may artificially inflate physical separation of tagged loci compared to untagged counterparts . We previously identified by 4C - seq a near - complete loss of Sox2 - SCR interaction in the early stages of ESC differentiation to neuronal precursors when Sox2 expression is shut down 54 . We recapitulated this finding when differentiating the labeled Sox2 - SCR WT cells , observing a significant 8 increase in average Sox2 - SCR distance ( median 200 nm ; p = 0 . 02 ; Wilcoxon rank sum test ) by the third day , in agreement with the timing of loss of interaction observed by allele - specific 4C ( Fig 2a , b ) . This cannot be solely explained by general chromatin compaction changes accompanying loss of pluripotency , because the average distances between the control regions were not significantly increased ( Fig 2c ; median 208 nm ; p = 0 . 15 ; Wilcoxon rank sum test ) . It has been proposed that promoter - enhancer “interactions” are somehow causal in transcriptional activation 3 , 6 , and the onset of increased promoter - enhancer separation corresponds to near - complete transcriptional shutdown of Sox2 ( Fig S1c ) . However , recent studies , including those at the murine Sox2 locus , have brought this into question 9 , 10 , 44 . To directly test the effect of transcription on promoter - enhancer proximity , we also measured Sox2 - SCR distances upon either global inhibition of transcription by treatment of the Sox2 - SCR WT cells with the drug triptolide ( which globally shuts down transcription by inhibiting TFIIH and inducing PolII degradation ) 55 , or specific inhibition of Sox2 expression in cis by the allele - specific deletion of two critical elements of the SCR ( SRR107 and SRR111 ) 44 to create the line Sox2 - SCR ΔSRR107 + 111 . In both cases , despite efficient loss of total or musculus - specific Sox2 expression , respectively , observed with qRT - PCR and single - molecule RNA FISH ( Fig S1d - f ) , average Sox2 - SCR ( and control region ) distances remained small and were non - significantly altered ( median distances 142 - 172 nm ; p > 0 . 05 ; Wilcoxon rank sum test ; Fig 2d ; Fig S2d ) . Overall , we thus find that the Sox2 promoter and SCR are frequently in relatively close proximity , over the sort of range traditionally called as “interactions” or “looping events” ( < 200 nm ) , and significantly closer than control regions of equivalent genomic separation . However , whereas early stages of neuronal differentiation can increase average physical separation between promoter and enhancer , their distances remain relatively close . Moreover , the promoter and enhancer remain proximal on orthogonal perturbations disrupting Sox2 transcription to the same extent , such as deletion of key SCR elements or pharmacological inhibition of transcriptional initiation . The idea that chromatin “interaction” and transcriptional activation can be decoupled is thus further reinforced . 9 Promoters and enhancers have more constrained chromatin motion than control sequences We previously reported that seemingly neutral elements within the HoxA locus exhibit different and locus - specific diffusive properties of labeled chromatin 25 . We therefore questioned whether chromatin mobilities are further different in promoters and enhancers , and whether these properties are linked to transcriptional output . Indeed , on examination of the tracks of labeled regions around the Sox2 locus , as well as their ensemble MSD curves , it was apparent that the promoter and enhancer were more limited to explore the nuclear volume than the control regions ( Fig 3a , b ) . To assess the local chromatin mobilities more quantitatively , we applied our previously developed GPTool to fit the track trajectories to a fractional Brownian motion ( FBM ) model and extract their apparent diffusion coefficients , D α _ app , and anomalous exponents , α app 25 . As previously , we confirmed that the trajectories approximated to self - similar Gaussian - distributed displacements and an FBM velocity autocorrelation function over the time scale in which measurements are taken ( Figs S3 and S4 ) , affirming the suitability of the model used . The experimental MSD profiles were non - linear when plotted on double - logarithmic scales , suggesting that their properties cannot be explained by one regime , likely due in the main part to the confounding effects of nuclear and cellular movement and rotation . When analyzing cross - correlations of co - measured trajectories to estimate global movements of the cell / nuclear substrate 25 , the experimental MSD curves fit very well as the sum of the component locus and substrate FBM regimes ( see Methods ; Fig S5a ) . We stress that GPTool , apart from assuming proximity to a global FBM regime , is actually agnostic to any specific polymer model , and obtains estimates of diffusive parameters for individual trajectories which can vary quite a lot from the average ( Fig 3c ) . As such , the obtained values of the apparent anomalous exponent , α app , give a measure of constraint to the particle movement , which can be fairly compared across experiments , but do not necessarily reflect the α value derived from conventional polymer physics models for bulk diffusive properties ( see also Discussion ) . In line with our initial observations , the average substrate - corrected apparent anomalous exponent was significantly smaller for the active elements , the Sox2 promoter ( median α app 0 . 130 ) and the SCR ( median α app 0 . 203 ) , than for the control 10 regions ( median α app 0 . 276 and 0 . 224 for intervening and downstream regions , respectively ) , indicating a greater constraint to their local movements ( Fig 3c ; full data given in Table S1 ) . We note that these measured values correspond well with the α ~ 0 . 2 determined from fits to radial MSD curves for lac / TetO - tagged CTCF - mediated interacting sites with a similar genomic separation of ~ 150 kb 40 . Analogous radial MSD analysis for the Sox2 - SCR WT and Inter - Down trajectories revealed similarly constrained motion , with the promoter and enhancer significantly more constrained than the neutral sequences ( p = 5 . 7x10 - 6 ; ANCOVA test ; Fig S5b ) . However , the nature of this analysis , by comparing the motion of one locus relative to the “fixed” second locus , does not allow any mobility differences between the two loci to be discerned . Using substrate - corrected GP - FBM , we further found that the promoter exhibited significantly more constrained motion than the enhancer ( q = 2x10 - 5 ; Wilcoxon rank sum test with Benjamini - Hochberg correction ) , and all four labeled regions around the Sox2 locus exhibited more constrained motion than was observed around the generally inactive HoxA locus in ESCs 25 ( Fig S5c ) . These results are in line with our previous observations in a transgenic system that genes explore a more restricted nuclear volume when they are induced 26 , potentially due to their engagement in specialized nuclear microenvironments for transcription . To explore these properties further , we modeled the 800 kb of ESC chromatin around the Sox2 locus as a self - avoiding polymer chain of 1 kb beads , classed as either “neutral” , binding PolII ( Sox2 promoter and enhancers , determined by peaks of the active histone mark , acetylation of lysine - 27 of histone H3 ( H3K27ac ) ) , transcribed genic regions ( Sox2 gene body ) , or binding CTCF ( determined by ChIP - seq peaks and with motif orientation information included ) . As we previously did for a theoretical locus to explain chromatin conformation changes on acute loss of PolII 56 , we performed molecular dynamics simulations using Langevin equations to model thermal motion of the chromatin and its binding factors , with the following additions to account for biological processes : PolII molecules have affinity for promoters and enhancers , and traverse the gene body to simulate transcription ; PolII molecules also have affinity to each other to simulate condensate formation ; cohesin complexes can bind anywhere on the polymer and extrude loops , but has preference to 11 load at promoters and enhancers , and is unable to process past a CTCF - bound site when the motif is oriented towards the extruding loop ( see Methods ) . The ensemble of chromatin conformations resulting from these simulations generated a contact map closely resembling that of the experimental Hi - C results ( Fig S5d ) . Collecting the trajectories of the beads corresponding to the parS - tagged loci , we derived simulation MSD curves indicating a clear reduced mobility of Sox2 and SCR compared to control sequences ( Fig 3d ) . In accordance , application of GPTool to the simulated trajectories gave significantly smaller α app measurements at the promoter and enhancer than control regions ( q < 5x10 - 22 ; Wilcoxon rank sum test with Benjamini - Hochberg correction ) ( Fig 3e ) . This relatively simplified depiction of the locus thus supports the experimental results , suggesting that promoter - enhancer “affinity” brought about by transcriptional regulation and / or loop extrusion processes is sufficient to explain their reduced chromatin dynamics . Transcriptional perturbation specifically reduces Sox2 promoter mobility We next measured the chromatin dynamics of the labeled loci on different means of transcriptional perturbation , reasoning that mobility constraints at the promoter and / or enhancer may be specifically relaxed . However , the distribution of apparent anomalous exponents of the Sox2 promoter did not change when the gene was silenced by either onset of differentiation or deletion of SRR107 / SRR111 ( Fig 3f , g , 6b ) , and α app of both the enhancer and promoter was only weakly and non - significantly increased on treatment with triptolide ( p > 0 . 05 ; Wilcoxon rank sum test ; Fig S5e ) . On the other hand , the SCR became significantly less constrained at the onset of ESC differentiation ( median α app 0 . 263 ; p = 0 . 002 ; Wilcoxon rank sum test ) , but so did the downstream control region ( median α app 0 . 337 ; p = 0 . 006 ) , raising questions as to whether this change is directly linked to transcriptional changes ( Fig 3f , g ) . Previous imaging studies , including our own , suggest that the dynamics of other gene loci are altered on their induction 26 , 27 , 30 , prompting us to look closer at the Sox2 locus trajectories . Indeed , inspection of the substrate movement - corrected ensemble MSD curves revealed that promoter mobility is generally 12 reduced when transcription is blocked by either triptolide treatment or deletion of SRR107 / SRR111 ( Fig 4a , b ) . The other parameter commonly used to quantify diffusive motion is the diffusion coefficient , D α , but since this is expressed in units of µm 2 / s α ( i . e . scaling according to α ) , its measurement can only be fairly compared between sets of trajectories containing exactly the same anomalous exponent . To quantify Sox2 promoter dynamics while accounting for the clear variability in measured α app between individual trajectories within a population ( Fig 3c ) , we used the D α _ app and α app values measured for each trajectory and computed r , the expected radius that the locus can explore in a given time interval , after accounting for substrate movement ( see Methods ) . For all timescales appropriate for our imaging conditions ( 0 . 5 - 60 s ) , the Sox2 promoter explored significantly less area when transcription was perturbed than during control conditions ( q < 0 . 05 ; Wilcoxon rank sum test with Benjamini - Hochberg multiple testing correction ; Fig 4c ) . It was previously proposed that “ongoing transcription may provide a source of nonthermal molecular agitation that can “stir” the chromatin within the local chromosomal domain” 30 . Our results partially support this hypothesis , although triptolide treatment had negligible effects on SCR dynamics ( Fig 4d ) , despite this enhancer producing transcripts in ESCs 57 . Further , general chromatin mobility , as measured in tagged histones , was found to actually be increased on pharmacological inhibition of transcription 28 . Taken together , our results suggest a clear but complex contribution of gene activity to chromatin dynamics . On the one hand , active elements are significantly more constrained than “neutral” genomic sequences , but transcriptional inhibition does not appear to “rescue” chromatin mobility at the former sequences . Conversely , we find evidence that a highly constrained promoter becomes even less mobile at extreme perturbation of target gene expression . The SCR has reduced chromatin dynamics on transcriptional firing The experiments performed so far have relied on perturbations , such as cell differentiation , cis - sequence deletions or treatment with drugs , to study effects of transcription , which are likely to have other indirect and confounding effects . To formally compare chromatin dynamics at transcribing versus non - 13 transcribing Sox2 alleles , we generated triple - labeled ESCs ( Sox2 - SCR MS2 ) , combining ANCHOR tags at the SCR and Sox2 promoter with musculus - specific incorporation of MS2 repeats into the 3’UTR of the intronless Sox2 gene 58 , and subsequent PiggyBac - mediated transposition of constructs for both fluorescently - labeled ParB proteins and MCP . This setup allows for simultaneous tracking of promoter , enhancer and nascent RNA ( Fig 5a , b ) . Previous labeling experiments at the Sox2 locus reported a significant reduction in transcription and SOX2 protein levels on incorporation of the MS2 / MCP system 9 , presumably due to interference at the 3’UTR . We screened numerous clones to find one with the minimal perturbation of Sox2 expression , estimating from allele - specific qRT - PCR , single - molecule RNA FISH and western blotting to have a mild reduction ( ~ 25 % ) of total protein levels or estimated transcription rates in our assayed cell line , despite an apparent destabilization of the MS2 - tagged mRNA when bound by MCP ( Fig S6a - c ) . Imaging transcription bursts over two - hour windows , we measure an average bursting time of ~ 200 s and an average time between bursts of ~ 630 s . As a population , the observed cells spent ~ 36 % of their time with a detected burst of transcription , nearly ten times more frequently than what was observed in the previous study using a cell line with more extensively perturbed Sox2 expression 9 . To measure chromatin dynamics at maximum temporal resolution , we then used this line for triple - label tracking over five - minute windows . Over this timeframe , the majority of movies were either always transcribing or always silent , but transition points were occasionally observed ( Fig 5b ) . When comparing transcribing and non - transcribing alleles , there were negligible differences in median promoter - enhancer separation ( 182 nm for transcribing , 175 nm for non - transcribing ; p = 0 . 6 ; Wilcoxon rank sum test ; Fig 5c ) or apparent anomalous exponent of the Sox2 promoter ( median 0 . 134 for transcribing , 0 . 111 for non - transcribing ; p = 0 . 37 ; Wilcoxon rank sum test ; Fig 5d ; full data given in Table S2 ) . Strikingly , however , we found that the enhancer is specifically more constrained on average when transcriptionally active ( median α app 0 . 148 for transcribing , 0 . 191 for non - transcribing ; p = 0 . 0078 ; Wilcoxon rank sum test ) . Moreover , whereas the Sox2 promoter has a significantly smaller median apparent anomalous exponent than that of the SCR in non - transcribing loci ( p = 3 . 1x10 - 5 ; Wilcoxon rank sum test ) , in line with what was measured in Sox2 - SCR WT cells ( Fig 3c ) , there is no significant difference 14 in α app between the two elements in transcriptionally bursting alleles ( p = 0 . 49 ; Wilcoxon rank sum test ) . Finally , the corrected MSD curves for transcriptionally active loci specifically display a plateau at larger time lapses ( Fig 5e and Fig S6d ) . This is more pronounced for SCR dynamics , but the Sox2 promoter also shows similar behavior , suggesting that both elements are effectively confined within a defined volume during transcription . It is interesting to speculate that this locus restriction is a consequence of transcription taking place in very specified nuclear foci 15 and / or condensates 21 , although chromatin dynamics will need to be traced over longer time periods , spanning several transcription bursts , to determine whether any volume restriction is exclusive to active states . Overall , this direct observation of chromatin dynamics relative to ongoing transcription shows an expectedly high cell - to - cell variability 26 , with the recurrent trend that in wild - type ESCs , the highly expressed Sox2 gene appears to have high constraints to local mobility that are not altered by transcriptional state . On the other hand , the SCR , while maintaining relative proximity ( but not necessarily complete juxtaposition ) to the target gene , has greater freedom of movement when the gene is transcriptionally poised yet inactive , but becomes constrained to levels comparable with the gene itself on transcriptional firing . Opposing effects of loop extrusion and promoter - enhancer communication on local chromatin mobility Aside from transcription , chromatin topology itself may have an influence on local dynamics . For example , multiple distal interactions such as those defining TAD borders may be expected to “tether” different chromatin regions and thus impose greater constraints on their movement 59 . Differentiation to neural precursors causes loss of the ESC - specific TAD border at the SCR , whereas the strong TAD border just upstream of the Sox2 promoter is maintained 60 ( Fig S7a ) . This loss of “anchoring” to distal regions could thus be responsible for the previously observed reduced mobility constraints at the SCR ( and into the downstream TAD ; Fig 3f , g ) , potentially independent of transcriptional changes . We previously showed that in ESCs , the SCR TAD border is resilient to large genetic deletions , including SRR107 , SRR111 and the predominant CTCF site at the enhancer , even though the latter site was able to 15 mediate chromatin interactions in other contexts , presumably by stalling loop extrusion 44 ( CTCF SCR site in Fig 6a ) . To assess the potential effect of loop extrusion processes on local chromatin dynamics , we generated derivative lines of Sox2 - SCR WT cells , harboring homozygous deletions of 16 - 24 nt at the core CTCF binding motifs located either just upstream of the Sox2 promoter ( Sox2 - SCR ΔCTCF _ Sox2 ) or within the SCR ( Sox2 - SCR ΔCTCF _ SCR ) ( Figs 6a and S7b ) . As expected , ChIP - qPCR confirmed that these deletions eliminated local CTCF binding ( Fig S7c ) . Both lines maintained high expression of pluripotency marker genes ( Fig S1b ) , and Sox2 expression was only mildly ( and non - significantly ) reduced in the Sox2 - SCR ΔCTCF _ SCR line , in agreement with previous findings for homozygous deletions of this element 61 , although expression was reduced to ~ 60 % of wild - type levels in the Sox2 - SCR ΔCTCF _ Sox2 line ( Fig S7d ) . In agreement with previous studies of the respective roles of these CTCF sites on Sox2 - SCR interaction 44 , 46 , 61 , allele - specific 4C - seq and ANCHOR inter - probe distance measurements showed negligible topological changes when the SCR CTCF site is deleted and a mild reduced interaction on homozygous deletion of the Sox2 CTCF site ( Fig S7e , f ) . Despite these somewhat limited phenotypic effects , both lines demonstrated a significantly reduced local constraint on chromatin mobility when CTCF binding was abrogated : the median apparent anomalous exponent was increased at the Sox2 promoter in Sox2 - SCR ΔCTCF _ Sox2 cells ( 0 . 156 ; p = 0 . 018 ; Wilcoxon rank sum test ) and at the SCR in Sox2 - SCR ΔCTCF _ SCR cells ( 0 . 235 ; p = 0 . 036 ; Wilcoxon rank sum test ) , with negligible , insignificant changes to α app at the regulatory element which maintains CTCF binding ( Fig 6b - e ) . These findings mirror the observed increase in radial MSD on deletion of CTCF binding sites within a transgenic CTCF - mediated looping construct 40 , although the nature of this experimental setup could not distinguish whether dynamics are specifically altered locally at the CTCF anchor site , or whether they are also propagated to looping anchor partners . Our results support a more localized effect on chromatin dynamics . Previously published simulations suggest that , at short time scales consistent with our measurements , active loop extrusion increases mobility of the underlying chromatin fiber 62 , although cohesin loading itself generally imposes constraints on the underlying chromatin at larger scales 28 , 40 . We propose that removal of CTCF from one site , by removing the barrier to loop extrusion through it , permits a localized relaxation of 16 movement constraints , explaining the focal increase in α app . The observed relaxation does not appear to efficiently propagate to their “looping partners” , presumably because actual CTCF - CTCF juxtapositions are rather rare events 39 . An alternative hypothesis is that the general binding of non - nucleosomal factors to DNA changes its biophysical properties to result in “stiffer” , more constrained chromatin motion . However , this is not supported in our experiments since the median apparent anomalous exponent at the SCR is actually significantly reduced ( i . e . even greater mobility constraints are imposed ) on deletion of multiple transcription factor binding sites at SRR107 and SRR111 ( 0 . 161 ; p = 0 . 0048 ; Wilcoxon rank sum test ; Fig 6d , e ) . Dispersed transcription factor binding sites at the Sox2 and other loci have been shown to cluster via protein - protein interactions in ESCs 12 , and such homotypic interactions are believed to be a basis for chromosome compartment formation 63 . Various studies suggest that loop extrusion and chromosome compartmentation are antagonistic processes organizing population - averaged chromatin architectures 47 , 48 , 56 , 62 , 64 . It is therefore possible that processes responsible for compartmentation are also generally antagonistic to cohesin - mediated loop extrusion . To assess this possibility further , we ran molecular dynamics simulations of the above genetic perturbations within our framework , by either converting one or other of the CTCF - bound beads to a “neutral” one to mimic specific loss of the binding motif , or recapitulating the Sox2 - SCR ΔSRR107 , 111 line by deleting the corresponding beads , and abolishing PolII binding at the inactivated Sox2 promoter . The original model did not recapitulate the chromatin dynamics changes observed in the experiments ( Fig S8 ) . In particular , the model predicted that transcription factor site deletions at the SCR would increase mobility at the enhancer , instead of placing greater constraints as we had observed . Strikingly , better agreement to experimental observations was accomplished by increasing RNA polymerase stability at bound enhancers , effectively reinforcing the competition between transcription - linked compartmentation and loop extrusion ( see Methods ) . In these simulations , removal of the local transcription factor binding sites placed greater constraints on the enhancer , and removal of CTCF had the inverse effect ( Fig 7a , b ) . Moreover , these simulations predicted greater cohesin occupancy at the SCR CTCF site on deletion of the 17 flanking transcription factor binding sites . This may be predicted to allow more loop extrusion to pass through the locus , resulting in greater average local constraints as more alleles have stalled cohesin at the adjacent CTCF site . In support , we found by allele - specific ChIP - qPCR that binding of the cohesin subunit Rad21 is increased at the SCR CTCF site when adjacent transcription factor binding regions , SRR107 and SRR111 , are deleted in cis ( p = 0 . 001 ; two - tailed t - test ; Fig 7c ) , suggesting that these elements are indeed antagonistic to cohesin recruitment and / or loop extrusion . Overall , these results extend on recent studies into the effects of loop extrusion and its stalling by CTCF on chromatin dynamics , showing a surprising localized effect . Furthermore , two different mechanisms believed to contribute in building the same promoter - enhancer topology , CTCF - mediated architectures and enhancer - promoter “contacts” , presumably via specific transcription factors and potential compartmentation , may actually have opposing effects on local chromatin dynamics ( Fig 7d ) . DISCUSSION By combining live imaging of labeled endogenous loci with a battery of perturbation experiments and molecular dynamics simulations , we have teased apart some of the spatiotemporal complexities of enhancer - promoter communication . The ANCHOR system employs relatively small tags that can be placed extremely close to genomic loci of interest with negligible observable effects on transcription , nuclear organization and cell state , so is a valuable tool for such studies . The first question we addressed was whether promoters and enhancers need to directly juxtapose for transcriptional firing , since conventional C - method and light microscopy approaches have given rather different viewpoints 20 . We found that Sox2 and the SCR are frequently in close proximity ( distances < 200 nm ) , and significantly closer than control regions of identical genomic separation , in agreement with Hi - C predictions . However , transcriptionally active loci can be also be found with greater physical separation between the Sox2 and SCR than non - transcribing alleles , strongly arguing against any obligation for their direct juxtaposition 18 for expression . Moreover , promoter - enhancer distances were unchanged in all transcriptional perturbations in this study that did not affect the TAD border at the SCR , completely in line with recent C - method studies at this locus 44 , 46 . So if direct juxtaposition of the enhancer is not required for transcription , how close is close enough ? Clusters of PolII and transcription factors have been observed to have diameters of ~ 100 - 200 nm in live nuclei 12 , 13 , providing a reasonable first estimate of the size of proposed transcriptional hubs , and thus the maximum separation of regulatory elements if they need to share the same microenvironment for transcriptional firing . What is unclear so far is whether the enhancer needs to be engaged in the hub during the whole transcriptional cycle , or if it is free to disengage after initiation in a “hit and run” mechanism . Since control sequences separated by only 150 kb are also frequently closer than the proposed 200 nm threshold , and these measurements are below the diffraction limit of our microscopy setup , we could not resolve these models in this study . However , since the SCR is less constrained than Sox2 in non - transcribing alleles , but has average dynamics indistinguishable from the promoter when the gene is transcribed , our results indirectly favor enhancer engagement in the transcriptional hub / environment on at least the minute scale , in line with studies in a Drosophila transgene 7 . Studies in loci with more distal enhancers , particularly those which seem to depend on cohesin - mediated loop extrusion for gene activation ( presumably as a mechanism to help the enhancer “find” its distal target ) 42 , 43 , in combination with visualization of any hubs themselves , will be required to formally address these questions . Whereas average inter - probe distances only demonstrated subtle differences at best in this study , MSD plots revealed more dramatic locus - and condition - specific differences in chromatin dynamics , with the most obvious being the greater relative freedom of movement of control sequences compared to the constrained promoter and enhancer . Conventional fits to ensemble log - transformed MSD curves are not precise and only robustly identify very flagrant differences in dynamics ; our previously developed GP - FBM framework demonstrably gives greater precision in diffusive property measurements of single trajectories , both on simulations 25 and in complex and noisy experimental data ( see fits in Fig S5a ) . A 19 limitation of this approach , which is also shared by radial MSD analysis , is the requirement to use cross - correlations of co - measured trajectories to correct for global nuclear movements and rotations , which can be quite large in ESCs ( trials of alternative means to measure substrate movement revealed them to be much less robust ) . Since the movements of monomers are more highly correlated when they are closer along the polymer , the dynamics of loci separated by 150 kb are underestimated , resulting in anomalous diffusion exponents much smaller than expected from most polymer physics models 40 , also explaining the consistently lower measured α app values , when compared to results of our simulations , which do not have nuclear movements . These underestimated α app values are nevertheless precise and comparable between experimental conditions , allowing quantitative comparisons of chromatin mobility changes . There is the possibility that a perturbation could affect the coupling of the two labeled loci more than the individual particle dynamics in themselves , which could be missed by GPTool , but this does not seem to be the case , since most perturbations were found to have localized effects on only SCR or Sox2 , and not both together . The major question we wished to address was how chromatin mobility is affected by transcription . For the Sox2 locus , we found clear links between chromatin dynamics and gene expression : the constrained promoter , but not the SCR , was sensitive to strong transcriptional inhibition by either enhancer element deletion or triptolide treatment , becoming even less mobile . Furthermore , when directly comparing transcribing and non - transcribing alleles within minimally perturbed cells , Sox2 promoter dynamics were relatively unaltered , whereas the SCR became more constrained upon transcriptional firing of its partner gene . A model that may explain these findings are that there are ( at least ) two distinct processes linking transcriptional control and local chromatin mobility : entry into a transcriptional hub , and transcription itself ( Fig 7e ) . Due to apparent confinement within a more limited volume , delimited by the hub , or perhaps just because of the even more crowded environment , presence of a locus in a transcriptional hub would be expected to reduce its underlying chromatin mobility . Conversely , as proposed previously 30 , the ATP hydrolysis and / or PolII tracking associated with transcription may be expected to add kinetic energy to the local chromatin and thus increase its mobility . In this manner , the 20 results can then be explained by the Sox2 gene , a key pluripotency gene with many constitutive and tissue - specific transcription factor binding sites at its promoter and proximal enhancers , as frequently nucleating its own hub in ESCs , partly explaining its consistent low mobility . The SCR , in contrast , has dynamics behavior consistent with it specifically entering the hub ( and hence increasing its constraint ) on transcriptional activation . Although the SCR is itself transcribed 57 , this is at much lower levels than Sox2 , so may not feature significantly in the measurements . Moreover , it is not clear if the SCR eRNA is co - transcribed with Sox2 , so may not necessarily occur when the SCR is sharing a transcriptional hub with Sox2 . While explaining our results , and coherent with results from different prior studies , this hypothesis requires experiments beyond current technological capabilities to formally test , simultaneously tagging hub components , nascent RNA and the promoter and enhancer over sufficiently long time periods to cover multiple transcription cycles while maintaining high temporal resolution . However , the results of our study alone are highly evocative in suggesting that some loci are able to nucleate their own transcription - competent microenvironments , whereas others need to “find” them , raising questions about how such a “hierarchy” is formed , and the mechanisms influencing the search time to access pre - existing hubs . As Sox2 and the SCR are strong TAD borders in ESCs , and cohesin - mediated loop extrusion has recently been shown to affect chromatin mobility 40 , much of their local constraints could perhaps be explained by mechanisms independent of transcription . Indeed , abrogation of CTCF binding caused localized increases in chromatin mobility , which was particularly noteworthy at the SCR , considering that deletion of this site had negligible changes on global chromatin conformation ( as determined by population - average 4C - seq ) or Sox2 expression . We also note that identifying the localized changes in chromatin dynamics is only possible by the analytical framework that we have developed . Even more striking was the finding that deletion of transcription factor binding sites had opposing effects on local dynamics to CTCF site deletion . Assuming that transcription factor clustering is one aspect of chromosome compartmentation 50 , this is reminiscent of the known antagonism between loop extrusion 21 and compartments in defining chromosome conformations ( Fig 7d ) . Indeed , our molecular dynamics simulations required direct competition between the loop extrusion and transcription - linked interaction processes to recapitulate the experimental findings . Since transcription hubs are assumed to place greater movement constraints on the chromatin within , this model implies a ) that stalled cohesin is quantitatively more constraining than residing within a hub ; b ) that transcription factor clusters impede loop extrusion without causing stalled cohesin . This latter point is supported by the recent finding that transcription start sites form cohesin - independent TAD borders 65 , although the exact mechanisms are unclear , particularly as SMC complexes are able to bypass RNA polymerase and other large chromatin complexes in vitro 66 . Whatever the exact mechanisms , the implications for transcriptional regulation are very important : loop extrusion is believed necessary to allow the more distal enhancers to search effectively for their targets , but may actually be a barrier itself to forming the transcriptionally competent microenvironment . More detailed studies on the interplay of these two processes in living cells will be highly challenging but fascinating . The Sox2 locus , containing an ESC - dedicated ( super ) enhancer ~ 150 kb from the promoter , comprising clusters of binding sites for tissue - specific transcription factors oriented around one major CTCF site facing the gene , and with no other confounding genes within the locus , was a convenient model for the studies presented here . Although many of the organizational principles uncovered here likely apply to many genes , more systematic studies will be required to formally test this . For example , the limited deletion studies performed so far have already shown large differences in robustness of TAD structures to loss of specific CTCF sites 67 , which could also play out in their dynamics . The ANCHOR system and its derivatives , coupled to orthogonal systems to track nuclear hubs and loop extrusion processes , will open new avenues to understanding the spatiotemporal regulation of transcription . 22 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS ANCHOR constructs were provided by NeoVirTech .

Comparisons between allelic binding are made by two - tailed t - tests , with p - values given . More Rad21 is bound to the SCR CTCF site , specifically on the allele where SRR107 and SRR111 are deleted . d ) Schematic of competing processes dictating dynamics at the SCR . At the top , extruding cohesin complexes ( yellow ) place temporary local constraints on mobility of the bound sequences . Such constraints are stabilized when the cohesin encounters bound CTCF ( orange ) in the appropriate orientation . At the bottom , bound RNA polymerase and transcription factors can also coordinate the Sox2 and SCR position , but are refractory to cohesin recruitment and / or extrusion , hence maintaining a relatively more mobile chromatin locus . The equilibrium of these two processes , shifted by deletion of the flanking transcription factor binding sites in Sox2 - SCR ΔSRR107 + 111 cells , results in more constrained chromatin on average . e ) Two - step model of Sox2 transcription , and its consequences for locus mobility . In the poised state ( left ) , the Sox2 gene resides within a nuclear hub of concentrated transcription factors , whereas the SCR is outside and exchanging with less concentrated factors within the nucleoplasm . Due to its dense environment , the hub places greater constraints on local chromatin mobility . In the transcribing state ( right ) , the enhancer is more constrained on entering the nuclear hub , and this more efficient exchange with the gene allows transcriptional firing . The gene , while remaining constrained within the hub , has more local kinetic energy as a potential consequence of transcription itself . Note that the physical distance between SCR and Sox2 is less important in this model than whether or not the elements are residing in the nuclear hub . 29 METHODS Cell lines and culture Mouse F1 ESCs ( M . musculus 129 × M . castaneus female cells obtained from Barbara Panning ) were cultured on 0 . 1 % gelatin - coated plates in ES medium ( DMEM containing 15 % FBS , 0 . 1 mM MEM nonessential amino - acids , 1 mM sodium pyruvate , 2 mM GlutaMAX , 0 . 1 mM 2 - mercaptoethanol , 1000 U / mL LIF , 3 µM CHIR9902 1 [ GSK3β inhibitor ] , and 1 µM PD0325901 [ MEK inhibitor ] ) , which maintains ESCs in a pluripotent state in the absence of a feeder layer 68 , 69 . The Sox2 - SCR WT and Inter - Down lines were generated by allele - specific CRISPR / Cas9 - mediated knock - in of ANCH1 sequence 51 into the SCR or downstream control region , and ANCH3 sequence 26 into the Sox2 promoter - proximal region or intervening control region , respectively . Flanking homology arms were first introduced by PCR amplification and Gibson assembly into vectors containing the ANCH1 or ANCH3 sequence , and 1 µg of each vector were co - transfected with 3 µg of plasmid containing Cas9 - GFP , a puromycin resistance marker and a scaffold to encode the two gRNAs specific to the two insertion sites ( generated by the IGBMC molecular biology platform ) in 1 million F1 ESCs with Lipofectamine - 2000 . SNPs remove the NGG PAM sequence at the castaneus allele , assuring allele - specific knock - in ( sequences given in Table S3 ) . Two days after transfection , the cells were cultured for 24 h with 3 µg / mL , then 48 h with 1 µg / mL puromycin to enrich for transfected cells , before sorting individual GFP - positive cells into 96 - well plates and amplification of individual clones . Heterozygous clones with the correct sequences inserted in the musculus allele were screened by PCR and sequencing . Sox2 - SCR ΔSRR107 + 111 cells were derived from the Sox2 - SCR WT line , essentially as in ref 44 . Briefly , musculus - specific deletion of SRR111 was first achieved by co - transfection with plasmids containing four allele - specific gRNAs and Cas9D10A - GFP using Lipofectamine - 2000 , then PCR screening as in ref 70 . Heterozygous deletion clones were subsequently co - transfected with vectors containing two allele - specific gRNAs and Cas9 - GFP to delete SRR107 ( sequences given in Table S3 ) . 30 Sox2 - SCR ΔCTCF _ Sox2 and Sox2 - SCR ΔCTCF _ SCR cells were derived from the Sox2 - SCR WT line , essentially as in ref 61 . 1 million cells were co - transfected with 2 µg plasmid containing Cas9 - GFP , a puromycin resistance marker and a scaffold to encode a gRNA targeting the relevant CTCF site ( generated by the IGBMC molecular biology platform ; sequences given in Table S3 ) and 1 µg Alt - R homology - directed repair single - stranded DNA oligonucleotide ( IDT ; sequences given in Table S4 ) with Lipofectamine - 2000 . The repair oligonucleotides are designed to replace the CTCF motif with an EcoR I site to help screening knock - outs . Two days after transfection , the cells were cultured for 24 h with 3 µg / mL , then 48 h with 1 µg / mL puromycin to enrich for transfected cells , before sorting individual GFP - positive cells into 96 - well plates and amplification of individual clones . Deletions were evaluated on agarose gel after PCR amplification of the region around the deletion and EcoR I digestion . Homozygous deletions were confirmed by sequencing . Sox2 - SCR MS2 cells were derived from the Sox2 - SCR WT line by co - transfecting 1 million cells with 2 µg plasmid containing Cas9 and the scaffold encoding a gRNA at the Sox2 3’UTR , and 2 µg targeting vector containing the MS2 cassette , comprising 24 copies of the v6 MS2 repeat 58 , a hygromycin resistance cassette flanked by loxP sites , and primer binding sites to facilitate screening for inserted clones , following the strategy of ref 71 ( Fig S9 ) , with Lipofectamine - 2000 . Three days after transfection , cells with integrated vector were selected with nine days of treatment with 200 µg / mL hygromycin . Individual cells were sorted into 96 - well plates for clonal amplification , which were screened for heterozygous ( musculus - specific ) incorporation of full length 24xMS2 repeats by PCR and sequencing . To remove the selection marker , which may perturb Sox2 mRNA function , 1 million cells were transfected with 4 µg Cre - GFP vector with Lipofectamine - 2000 , and after three days were subjected to selection with 6 µM ganciclovir for ten days . Marker excision and maintenance of full - length MS2 construct were verified by PCR and sequencing in surviving colonies . Finally , 1 million cells were co - transfected with 1 µg ePiggyBac transposase expression plasmid ( System Biosciences ) and 1 µg each epB - MCP - mScarletI , epB - OR1 - EGFP and epB - OR3 - IRFP vectors ( the OR vectors are derived from those used in ref 25 by 31 adding flanking inverted terminal repeats for recognition by ePiggyBac transposase ; original vectors available from NeoVirTech ) with Lipofectamine - 2000 . Nine days after transfection , fluorescent cells were sorted in bins ( low , medium and high ) based on expression of the different fluorescent proteins , and tested by microscopy . Cells with Scarlet high / GFP low / IRFP low fluorescence were found to be optimal for imaging experiments , and this population was maintained for subsequent experiments . Live imaging Cells were transiently transfected with OR vectors ( except for the stably expressing Sox2 - SCR MS2 line ) and imaged essentially as in ref 25 . 150 , 000 cells were plated two days prior to imaging onto laminin - 511 - coated 35 mm glass bottom petri dishes and transfected with 2 µg each OR1 - EFGP and OR3 - IRFP plasmids with Lipofectamine - 2000 . Medium was changed just before imaging to remove dead cells . Imaging was performed on an inverted Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope equipped with a PFS ( perfect focus system ) , a Yokogawa CSU - X1 confocal spinning disk unit , two sCMOS Photometrics Prime 95B cameras for simultaneous dual acquisition to provide 95 % quantum efficiency at 11 µm x 11 µm pixels and a Leica Objective HC PL APO 100x / 1 . 4 oil . A Tokai Hit Stage incubator allowed for maintenance at 37ºC and 5 % CO 2 throughout the experiment . The system was controlled using Metamorph 7 . 10 software . For double - label experiments , EGFP and IRFP were excited by 491 - nm and 635 - nm lasers . Green and far - red fluorescence were detected with an emission filter using a 525 / 50 nm and 708 / 75 nm detection window , respectively . Time - lapse was performed in 2D , acquiring 241 time points at 0 . 5 s interval . For triple - label experiments , EGFP and IRFP were first imaged as for the double - label , then mScarletI was excited at an identical z - position with a 561 - nm laser , and red fluorescence was detected with an emission filter using a 609 / 54 nm detection window .

For statistical comparison of specific interactions , the 4C read counts within 1 Mb of the bait for all replicates and conditions ( from the same bait ) were quantile normalized using the limma package 74 . The means of summed normalized 4C scores over tested interacting regions were taken as “interaction scores” , and were compared across conditions by two - tailed t - tests . 3D DNA FISH FISH probes were generated by nick translation from fosmids centered on the ANCHOR insertion sites ( WI1 - 2125O9 for Sox2 , WI1 - 788C1 for Inter , WI1 - 111C20 for SCR , WI1 - 156F5 for Down ) , labeling the DNA with dUTP conjugated to biotin ( SCR and Down probes ) or digoxigenin ( Sox2 and Inter probes ) .

Quantification at the musculus and castaneus SRR109 ( SCR CTCF site ) was expressed as fold - enrichment over the amplification at a non - genic , negative control sequence , not bound by Rad21 , CTCF or known pluripotency transcription factors . Localizing and tracking chromatin loci Live imaging experiments were treated essentially as in ref 25 . First , spot detection and tracking was performed with ICY 78 , before localization precision enhancement in GPTool 25 . This assumes that the spots have the shape of a 2D Gaussian function , as follows , 𝑆𝑆 𝑥𝑥 , 𝑦𝑦 = 𝐼𝐼 𝑜𝑜 𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒 �− 1 2 �𝑒𝑒 − 𝜇𝜇 𝑥𝑥 𝑦𝑦 − 𝜇𝜇 𝑦𝑦 � 𝑇𝑇 � 𝐿𝐿 𝑥𝑥2 𝜃𝜃𝐿𝐿 𝑥𝑥 𝐿𝐿 𝑦𝑦 𝜃𝜃𝐿𝐿 𝑥𝑥 𝐿𝐿 𝑦𝑦 𝐿𝐿 𝑦𝑦2 � −1 �𝑒𝑒 − 𝜇𝜇 𝑥𝑥 𝑦𝑦 − 𝜇𝜇 𝑦𝑦 � � + 𝐵𝐵 𝐺𝐺 with µ i representing the center of mass of the spot , L i its size in directions x and y , - 1 < θ < 1 a possible rotation , while B G and I o are background and spot signal , respectively . The localization is optimized using the NM - Simplex method , and localization error is estimated using the Metropolis - Hastings algorithm . Any outlier detection events , defined as having any of the signal intensity , spot size or localization error deviating from the median value within the experiment by more than twice the inter - quartile range , were 39 removed from subsequent analysis . For the Sox2 - SCR MS2 line , ICY was additionally used for spot detection and tracking of MCP ( mScarletI ) . The majority of experiments had MCP detection for virtually all or none of the frames , and were categorized as “transcribing” and “non - transcribing” cells , respectively . The other experiments were only included in the analysis if they contained at least 75 contiguous frames with MCP signal ( “transcribing” ) and / or absence ( “non - transcribing” ) . For these , the largest contiguous stretch of frames above this threshold was maintained for subsequent analysis . Inter - probe distance analysis For inter - spot distance measurements , effects of camera misalignments and chromatic aberrations were corrected with a set of generic affine transformations , including translation , rotation and scaling , defined as , Ω = � 𝑠𝑠 𝑥𝑥 0 ( 1 − 𝑠𝑠 𝑥𝑥 ) 𝑊𝑊 / 2 0 𝑠𝑠 𝑦𝑦 � 1 − 𝑠𝑠 𝑦𝑦 �𝐻𝐻 / 2 0 0 1 � � 1 0 𝑑𝑑 𝑥𝑥 + 𝑐𝑐 𝑥𝑥 0 1 𝑑𝑑 𝑦𝑦 + 𝑐𝑐 𝑦𝑦 0 0 1 � � cos ( 𝜃𝜃 ) sin ( 𝜃𝜃 ) 0 − sin ( 𝜃𝜃 ) cos ( 𝜃𝜃 ) 0 0 0 1 � � 1 0 −𝑐𝑐 𝑥𝑥 0 1 −𝑐𝑐 𝑦𝑦 0 0 1 � where s i accounts for scaling in directions x and y , d i accounts for translation in both directions and θ is the angle of rotation between both channels in relation to point c i . To infer optimal parameters for correction , five frames from each of the movies recorded in the session were used and the likelihood was maximized using the Nelder - Mead simplex method , log 𝑃𝑃 ∝ − 𝑊𝑊𝐻𝐻 2 log �� [ 𝐼𝐼 2 ( 𝑘𝑘 , 𝑙𝑙 | Ω ) − 𝐼𝐼 1 ( 𝑘𝑘 , 𝑙𝑙 | 𝟙𝟙 ) ] 2 𝑘𝑘 , 𝑙𝑙 � where W and H correspond to width and height of images , and I r ( k , l | A ) is the value of pixel ( k , l ) in channel r given transformation A . Here , 𝟙𝟙 represents the identity matrix . Visual inspection of acquired images before and after correction , and comparison with direct subtractions from optical beads , found the affine transformations to work better than the optical beads . After applying these transformations to the final localized spots , the 2D distances between two spots is then computed in a Pythagorean framework . The median distances were taken for each imaging experiment , and distributions of these distances were 40 compared between cell lines and experimental conditions ( or 2D distances determined by analogous methods such as FISH ) by Wilcoxon rank sum tests . Transcriptional bursting measurements Using the LiveCell pipeline ( github . com / Lenstralab / livecell ) 79 , maximal intensity projections were made of the 3D movies , followed by background subtraction and cell segmentation using Otsu thresholding and watershedding . Transcription bursts were detected and tracked using a 2D Gaussian fit followed by hysteresis filtering using 5 and 8 standard deviations of the background as low / high thresholds , respectively . Output data were manually checked to reject erroneous tracking or dividing cells . GP - FBM measurement of diffusive parameters Diffusive parameters for individual trajectories were estimated using GPTool 25 , which assumes that the stochastic diffusion trajectory of a chromatin locus can be modeled as a Gaussian process with the following fractional Brownian kernel : � ( 𝑡𝑡 , 𝑡𝑡 ′ ) = 𝐷𝐷 𝛼𝛼 ( | 𝑡𝑡 | 𝛼𝛼 + | 𝑡𝑡 ′ | 𝛼𝛼 − | 𝑡𝑡 − 𝑡𝑡 ′ | 𝛼𝛼 𝐷𝐷 𝛼𝛼 , 𝛼𝛼 producing generalized Brownian motion with mean squared displacement , 〈𝑟𝑟 2 〉 = 2 𝑛𝑛𝐷𝐷 𝑎𝑎 𝑡𝑡 𝛼𝛼 where n corresponds to the number of degrees of freedom . Formal derivation of the model and details of the methods used to optimize the model fit are found in ref 25 and references within . Experimental trajectories were verified as being reasonably fit by a fractional Brownian regime by checking that displacements are self - similar Gaussian distributed with the modeled covariance matrix ( Fig S3 ) and that the velocity autocorrelation function from experimental trajectories , 𝐶𝐶 𝑣𝑣 ( 𝜀𝜀 ) ( 𝜏𝜏 ) = 1 𝜀𝜀 2 〈 ( 𝑒𝑒 ( 𝜏𝜏 + 𝜀𝜀 ) − 𝑒𝑒 ( 𝜏𝜏 ) ) ( 𝑒𝑒 ( 𝜀𝜀 ) − 𝑒𝑒 ( 0 ) ) 〉 41 with velocity defined as v ( τ ) = ε - 1 [ x ( τ + ε ) - x ( τ ) ] , fits the theoretical velocity autocorrelation function for FBM ( Fig S4 ) : 𝐶𝐶 𝑣𝑣 ( 𝜀𝜀 ) ( 𝜏𝜏 ) 𝐶𝐶 𝑣𝑣 ( 𝜀𝜀 ) ( 0 ) = ( 𝜏𝜏 + 𝜀𝜀 ) 𝛼𝛼 − 2 𝜏𝜏 𝛼𝛼 + | 𝜏𝜏 − 𝜀𝜀 | 𝛼𝛼 2 𝜀𝜀 𝛼𝛼 To measure and correct for substrate movement , GPTool builds a covariance model to handle the cross - correlation that substrate motion introduces into the two measured particles’ trajectories , generating the probability distribution : 𝜌𝜌 ( 𝑟𝑟 1 , 𝑟𝑟 2 | 𝛼𝛼 , 𝐷𝐷 𝛼𝛼 ) ∝ 𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒 �− 1 2 �𝑟𝑟 1 𝑟𝑟 2 � 𝑇𝑇 �Σ 1 + Σ 𝑅𝑅 Σ 𝑅𝑅 Σ 𝑅𝑅 Σ 2 + Σ 𝑅𝑅 � −1 �𝑟𝑟 1 𝑟𝑟 2 �� where Σ 1 , Σ 2 and Σ R are FBM covariance matrices for the two particles and substrate , respectively , with diffusion parameters D α = { D α1 , D α2 , D αR } and α = { α 1 , α 2 , α R } . Formal derivation of the model and details of the methods used to optimize the model fit are found in ref 25 and references within . Overall , GPTool outputs , for each individual imaging experiment : more precise trajectories for the two particles ; estimations of diffusive parameters D α and α for each particle , with and without substrate correction ; estimations of the trajectory of the substrate , as well as its diffusive parameters , D αR and α R . Trajectory plots To generate the individual trajectory plots ( e . g . Fig 3a ) , the inferred substrate motion at each time interval was subtracted from the x and y coordinates of the GPTool - refined tracked particles , then multiplied by the scaling factor ( 110 nm per pixel ) to obtain corrected coordinates in nm for the particle at each time point . The deviation of these values from the median x - or y - value , respectively , of the trajectory were plotted , maintaining their temporal order , to generate comparable trajectory plots across experiments centered on the origin . MSD analysis 42 MSD analysis was performed using the msdanalyzer utility in Matlab 80 . For each individual trajectory , the time - averaged MSD was computed ( time steps of 0 . 5 - 120 s for most experiments ; 1 - 300 s for experiments with the Sox2 - SCR MS2 line ) , using either the trajectories uncorrected or corrected by GPTool for substrate movement , as stated . Because some trajectories exhibited large deviations from the average , especially at long time , we chose to calculate the ensemble median of all individual MSD and the median absolute deviation as a measure of the variability . For testing the fit of GPTool - measured parameters to experimental data , theoretical 2D MSD curves were made from these measured parameters for each individual trajectory , giving either 𝑀𝑀𝑆𝑆𝐷𝐷 = 4 𝐷𝐷 𝛼𝛼 , 𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑜𝑜𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 𝑡𝑡 𝛼𝛼 , 𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑜𝑜𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 for parameters called without substrate correction , or 𝑀𝑀𝑆𝑆𝐷𝐷 = 4 𝐷𝐷 𝛼𝛼 , 𝑢𝑢𝑜𝑜𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 𝑡𝑡 𝛼𝛼 , 𝑢𝑢𝑜𝑜𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 + 4 𝐷𝐷 𝛼𝛼 , 𝑠𝑠𝑢𝑢𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑟𝑟𝑎𝑎𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 𝑡𝑡 𝛼𝛼 , 𝑠𝑠𝑢𝑢𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑟𝑟𝑎𝑎𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 for the particle and substrate parameters called when substrate motion correction is applied . The ensemble medians of these MSD curves were plotted with the experimental MSD curves . Radial MSD was computed in exactly the same way as single - particle MSD , but using the evolution of Euclidean distance between two particles instead of the displacement of a single particle . The diffusive parameters were fit to the first 60 s of the log - log plots of radial MSD using linear least squares with bisquare weights , implemented in Matlab . 95 % confidence intervals were estimated as two standard deviations of the point estimates . Diffusive parameter differences between Sox2 - SCR and Inter - Down radial MSD were assessed by ANCOVA . Statistical comparison of inferred diffusive parameter distributions The distributions of inferred apparent anomalous diffusion coefficients from different genomic loci or experimental conditions were compared by Wilcoxon rank sum test , with Benjamini - Hochberg multiple testing correction in cases where four or more statistical tests were combined . Since D α _ app values cannot be fairly compared across trajectories with different inferred values of α app , the inferred values of D α _ app 43 and α app for each particle trajectory were fed into the generalized Brownian motion equation to compute , for each individual trajectory , the expected radius of exploration , r , in a given time , t : 𝑟𝑟 = � 4 𝐷𝐷 𝛼𝛼 𝑡𝑡 𝛼𝛼 These were computed for all trajectories for different time - lags ( 1 , 10 , 30 and 60 s ) , and their distributions were statistically compared with Wilcoxon rank sum tests . Note that these use the substrate - corrected inferred diffusive parameters , so the resultant “expected” explored area is smaller than experimental observations . Molecular dynamics simulations Molecular dynamics simulations were performed via the multipurpose EspressoMD package 81 , as in ref 56 . Individual proteins are represented by “beads” interacting via phenomenological force fields and move according to the Langevin equation , and the chromatin fiber is represented as a chain of beads connected by bonds . The position of every bead in the system evolves according to the Langevin differential equation that encodes Newton’s laws in the case of thermal bath with the friction γ due to an implied solvent in the presence of forces between beads encoded by energy potential functions U 82 , 83 . Langevin equations for all beads are simultaneously solved in EspressoMD using a standard Velocity - Verlet numerical algorithm . The potential connecting i and i + 1 beads of the fiber is a finitely extensible non - linear elastic ( FENE ) spring that adds up to a steric repulsion potential between non - adjacent sites of the polymer , the Weeks - Chandler - Andersen ( WCA ) potential : 𝑈𝑈 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 = − 𝐾𝐾 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 𝑅𝑅 02 2 𝑙𝑙𝑛𝑛 � 1 − � 𝑟𝑟 𝑖𝑖 , 𝑖𝑖 + 1 − 𝑟𝑟 0 𝑅𝑅 0 �� 𝑈𝑈 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊 = � 4 𝜖𝜖 �� 𝜎𝜎 𝑟𝑟 � 12 − � 𝜎𝜎 𝑟𝑟 � 6 + 1 4 � 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝑟𝑟 < 𝜎𝜎 2 1 6� 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝑟𝑟 < 𝜎𝜎 2 1 6� 0 𝑜𝑜𝑡𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑒𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑒 where r i , i + 1 is the distance between consecutive beads , and σ is where the interaction from repulsive becomes attractive and can be interpreted as the diameter of the particles . This value is a natural length 44 scale of the system . In FENE the parameters are fixed to have an equilibrium distance of 1 . 6 σ with maximum extension of 0 . 8 σ , and a bond energy of K FENE = 30 k B T . Since the fiber is resolved at 1 kb , chromatin rigidity cannot be neglected ( i . e . below the persistence length ) . Bending rigidity of the polymer is introduced via the Kratky - Porod potential for every three adjacent chromatin beads , where θ is the angle between three consecutive beads as given by : 𝑈𝑈 𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾 ( 𝜃𝜃 ) = 𝐾𝐾 𝐵𝐵𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐷𝐷 ( 1 − cos ( 𝜃𝜃 ) ) and K BEND is the bending energy . The persistence length in units of σ is given by L p = K BEND / k B T . The model includes : ( i ) full 3D loop extrusion by interplay of cohesin dimers and CTCF , and ( ii ) transcription by PolII particles . To simulate association of cohesin and PolII with chromatin , a harmonic potential was employed , mimicking formation of a stable bond between two particles that fluctuate around an equilibrium distance d 0 : 𝑈𝑈 𝐻𝐻 = 1 2 𝐾𝐾 𝐻𝐻 ( 𝑟𝑟 − 𝑑𝑑 0 ) 2 From now on , any description of the formation of a bond means the introduction of the aforementioned harmonic bond between the particles involved . To regulate the lifetime of these harmonic interactions , mechanisms of bond formation and removal were introduced according to cutoff distance c d below which a bond is formed , with a certain probability rate of detachment in units of time τ b = 2 τ ( τ being the fundamental unit of time in molecular dynamics ; see below ) . These are then set to approximate the experimentally - observed range of PolII transcription and cohesin loop extrusion speeds and chromatin residence time . Introduction of the above mechanics is added on top of the strings - binders - switch model ( SBS 84 ) , which encodes the association tendency of PolII with the Sox2 promoter ( defined as the 1 kb bead containing the transcription start site within the modeled region ) by means of the shifted , truncated Lennard - Jones ( LJ ) potential , allowing spontaneous co - localization of beads around a distance σ with lifetime and stability properties depending on the depth of the energy well 𝜖𝜖 : 45 𝑈𝑈 𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 = � 4 𝜖𝜖 ��𝜎𝜎𝑟𝑟� 12 − �𝜎𝜎𝑟𝑟� 6 + 𝑐𝑐 𝑠𝑠ℎ𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑠𝑠 � 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝑟𝑟 < 𝑟𝑟 𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑢𝑠𝑠 0 𝑜𝑜𝑡𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑒𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑒 where r cut is a cutoff distance , r is the separation of any two beads , and r cut = 2 . 5 σ for all LJ potentials in the simulations . This is a standard commonly used in the field to simulate phenomenological coarse - grained affinities 82 , 83 . For PolII interactions and transcription , the polymerase is presented as a bead with LJ interaction with specific beads of the chromatin fiber representing the promoter , enhancers ( defined as beads containing H3K27ac peaks ) or gene body ( beads containing Sox2 coding sequence ) with energy 𝜖𝜖 = 2k B T . Such mild affinity helps to identify promoters as the correct sites where transcription initiation will take place ( i . e . PolII forming stable bonds with the promoter bead ) before the elongation process starts along the gene body . LJ interactions were also introduced among PolII beads ( 𝜖𝜖 = 2 . 5k B T ) , to simulate their tendency to form condensates acting as transcription hubs , and between PolII and cohesin ( 𝜖𝜖 = 2k B T ) to simulate preferential loading of cohesin at promoter / enhancer beads . PolII transcription dynamics are simulated as a four - step process : attachment to the promoter in an exclusive manner , elongation starts , elongation proceeds through the gene body , detachment at the transcription termination site ( the end of the gene body ) . A bond forms if the beads are less distant in space than a certain cutoff ( 2 . 7 σ ) . To simulate the tendency of RNAPII to reel in gene body beads , a secondary bond is formed with the next bead on the chromatin fiber in the direction of transcription ( i + 1 bead , where i is the promoter coordinate on the fiber , and if transcription occurs in the sense direction ; i - 1 in the antisense direction ) . In the next step , RNAPII moves on the next site by forming new bonds with i + 1 site and dissolving the old ones with i . This happens at a given rate ( 0 . 4 τ b - 1 ) and only if the beads are found closer than a cutoff distance ( c d = 1 . 05 σ ) . These values are selected to obtain a RNAPII transcription speed approximately in the range of 1 - 10 kbp / min observed experimentally . Upon reaching the TES , RNAPII stops and becomes unbound with ra te 0 . 2 τb . Upon binding with promoters RNAPII loses its LJ interaction with promoters , since this is substituted by the bond itself . PolII is also allowed to form bonds with enhancers , although in this case no 46 transcription procedure is initiated . As for PolII - promoter case , such bond dissolves at a given rate . Since cohesin and PolII , in their chromatin bound state , interfere with one another , we explored different rates of PolII - enhancer bond dissociation to study the effect of loop extrusion - transcription competition on the locus dynamics , ranging from 2 bonds lost per second ( initial model , with limited competition ) to 0 . 5 bonds lost per second ( revised model , with reinforced competition ) . Cohesin concentration was maintained at 20 nM in the models . For CTCF binding , a single bead interacts via LJ potential ( 𝜖𝜖 = 2k B T ) with specific beads of the chromatin fiber ( CTCF ChIP - seq peaks containing oriented cognate binding motifs ) . Once a bond is formed ( with rate 0 . 8 τb - 1 ) it is pair - exclusive ( i . e . , other CTCF molecules cannot bind that same site ) . The bond dissolves at the rate 2x10 - 5 τb - 1 and CTCF is again free to diffuse and search for other binding sites . Cohesin is represented as a pair of beads connected by one bond ( r 0 = 1 . 6 σ and K = 8k B T ) . Extrusion has three steps : attachment , active extrusion , and detachment . For attachment , each cohesin monomer forms a bond with the chromatin fiber . Bonds form when a cohesin monomer and a chromatin site come within a given cutoff distance ( 1 . 6 σ ) and at a certain rate ( 0 . 1 τ b - 1 ) . Only the case where both monomers simultaneously form bonds on adjacent chromatin beads is considered a successful attachment and the dimer is retained for the next step ; otherwise bonds dissolve . If a promoter is already engaged in a bond with RNAPII , cohesin is forbidden to bind that promoter . Also , to favor cohesin loading in correspondence of active transcribing promoters , a 90 % chance of binding has been introduced when a cohesin molecule is close to a promoter / enhancer and at the same time one RNAPII is close by as well ( cutoff distance 1 . 5 σ ) , otherwise cohesin binding chance drops to 10 % . The active extrusion and detachment steps follow the same mechanics as for RNAPII , with the difference that RNAPII can reel through cohesin bound sites while the inverse is not allowed . New bonds are formed if the distance is below 1 . 1σ . Such parameters produce ranges of cohesin extruding speed of 15 - 30 kb / min , which is within the range of experimentally observed values 47 . This allows cohesin to be affected by the surroundings during extrusion ( e . g . presence of PolII close by or bound to adjacent sites ) . Cohesin detachment can 47 occur independently at any step at a given rate ( 10 - 4 τ b - 1 ) to fit its known chromatin residence time of 20 min . CTCF “loop anchors” are modeled so that cohesin cannot form new bonds with the next i ±1 site if the latter is already bound by CTCF , provided it has the binding motif in convergent orientation . This renders extrusion dependent on CTCF dynamics . Finally , cohesin has LJ affinity for PolII both in the bound ( 𝜖𝜖 = 2 . 5k B T ) and unbound state ( 𝜖𝜖 = 2k B T , higher affinity for bound RNAPII mimicking its suggested role in cohesin loading on chromatin 85 ) . PolII and loop extrusion dynamics are performed using a python script driving the EspressoMD library . The polymer initializes as a random walk and its dynamics first evolves in the absence of extrusion and transcription to generate an equilibrium coil formation . Extrusion and transcription processes are then switched on , and the evolution of the bead positions are tracked . Across all simulations , standard values for the friction coefficient ( γ = 0 . 5 ) and the time step ( t = 0 . 01 ) are used . To connect in silico space - time units with real distances and times , it is assumed that the concentration of DNA in the 3D simulation space is the same as that in a mammalian nucleus , giving a rough estimation of σ = 52 nm . For time units , the standard molecular dynamics relation τ = η ( 6πσ 3 / 𝜖𝜖 ) is used . Assuming a viscosity ~ 0 . 5P , the fundamental time unit is τ = 0 . 017 s . Concentrations of CTCF and PolII are taken from the physiological values and range from 30 to 60 nM . The energy scale of the system is given by the Boltzmann factor k B multiplied by the temperature of the system T = 310 K . The region modeled ( mm10 ; chr3 : 34 . 3 - 35 . 1 Mb ) encompasses the Sox2 gene , 16 enhancer beads from the peaks of H3K27ac , and 6 CTCF binding regions with directionality determined by orientation of binding motifs . CTCF binding regions can be composed of up to 3 beads where CTCF occupancy signal is the highest ( i . e . two regions upstream of Sox2 ) , so giving a stronger anchoring function to such regions . Polymer models for Sox2 - SCR ΔCTCF _ Sox2 and Sox2 - SCR ΔCTCF _ SCR have the relevant CTCF sites converted into non - CTCF binding beads , so to remove the cohesin anchoring effect . The model for Sox2 - SCR ΔSRR107 , 111 has the two enhancer beads immediately flanking the SCR CTCF region completely 48 removed from the polymer , and reduced RNAPII stability to the promoter ( from 0 . 02 bonds lost per second to 0 . 2 bonds lost per second ) , to mimic inactivation of the gene . The positions of the beads corresponding to the positions of ANCHOR labels were tracked across 40 simulations of 1000 timepoints , and these trajectories were subsequently fed into MSD fits and GPTool diffusive parameter estimations , as for the experimental trajectories . Data sources ESC and NPC Hi - C data were taken from ref 60 , and re - analyzed and visualized using FAN - C 86 . The differential Hi - C map was derived as in ref 87 . The normalized scores of the ESC Hi - C submatrix were subtracted from those of the NPC Hi - C submatrix , and the difference was expressed as a z - score : ( diff – mean ( diff ) ) / standard deviation ( diff ) ) . Insulation was computed using FAN - C with a binsize of 7 bins ( 28 kb ) . ESC ChIP - seq datasets for H3K27ac and CTCF were obtained from the CODEX database 88 . For comparison of 2D Sox2 - SCR distance distributions with analogous methods , results from oligoFISH were taken from ref 53 , and results from CuO / TetO experiments were taken from ref 9 .

Schematic for insertion of MS2 repeats in generation of Sox2 - SCR MS2 line . Construct containing 24x MS2v6 repeats and the positive - negative selection marker ( HSV - TK / HygroR ) is knocked 53 in directly adjacent to the STOP codon of Sox2 with CRISPR / Cas9 - mediated homologous recombination , and clones with insertions are selected with hygromycin . Inclusion of binding sequences for primers ( F and R ) flanking the Sox2 STOP codon in the knocked - in construct allows one PCR reaction to distinguish wild - type ( 155 bp product ) from inserted ( 82 bp and 197 bp products ) alleles . Heterozygous clones , producing all three PCR products are then screened further with Sanger sequencing to determine in which allele the MS2 repeats were inserted . The selectable marker , which may affect Sox2 transcription , is then excised by transfection with a Cre - expressing plasmid , selecting clones with gancyclovir treatment , and screening for expected loss of 197 bp PCR product .
