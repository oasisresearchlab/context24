In particular , the position and size of interface widgets ‚Äîsuch as entity cards and query suggestions‚Äîare usually considered a negligible constant . In contrast , in this work , we investigate the impact of widget position - ing on user behaviour . To this end , we focus on one specific widget : the Query History Widget ( QHW ) . It allows users to see ( and thus reflect ) on their recently issued queries . We build a novel simula - tion model based on Search Economic Theory ( SET ) that considers how users behave when faced with such a widget by incorporating its positioning on the SERP . We derive five hypotheses from our model and experimentally validate them based on user interaction data gathered for an ad - hoc search task , run across five different placements of the QHW on the SERP . We find partial support for three of the five hypotheses , and indeed observe that a widget‚Äôs location has a significant impact on search behaviour .

Microeconomic theory can also provide us with an intuitive means to model human - computer in - teractions [ 1 ] . Given a demand ( that may arise from factors such as the nature of the context , the underlying task , or the system used ) , a user will exert effort to interact with the system by expending internal resources such as their working memory , attention , or en - ergy . Users of a system will also incur a cost by expending external resources such as time , money , or physical effort ( such as moving a mouse , or typing on a keyboard ) [ 37 ] . In the context of Information Retrieval ( IR ) , interactions between the user and system may lead to benefits in terms of information obtained , or resolved information needs [ 5 , 7 ] . Rational users looking to maximise profit from their interactions can do so by either maximising their benefit or by minimising their expended cost and effort‚Äîand thus subscribe to the Principle of Least Effort [ 55 ] . Assuming that searchers behave in a rational way ( a reasonable assumption to make [ 3 ] ) , we can model their interactions with a search engine to obtain insights into the different decisions made during the interaction process . In turn , these insights can help us provide explanations as to why users behave in a certain way . Importantly , such a model allows us to generate testable hypotheses as to how user behaviour will likely change when interface designs are modified based on a cost / benefit analysis of interface elements . For example , a study by Azzopardi et al . [ 3 ] found partial support for the hypothesis that , as the cost and / or effort of issuing a query increases , users of a search system will issue fewer queries and examine more documents per query . Traditionally , Information Seeking and Retrieval ( ISR ) models [ 8 ‚Äì 10 , 16 , 22 , 51 ] provide post - hoc explanations as to what happens during episodes of information seeking . While these models are un - doubtedly useful , they have no predictive power : we cannot employ them to learn what is likely to happen in terms of user behaviour when changes are made to the retrieval system in question . This predictive power is necessary , for instance , in order to simulate the effects changes to the presentation of a Search Engine Results Page ( SERP ) have on user behaviour , without having to run many costly user studies . Ultimately , the goal here is to only run user studies on interface designs that have shown promise from prior simulations . In contrast to aforementioned models of ISR , our work follows a recent line of research that focuses on building mathematical models based on Search Economic Theory ( SET ) [ 1 , 2 ] which is in - spired by microeconomic theory‚Äîor Information Foraging Theory ( IFT ) [ 42 , 43 ] . These models allow us to relate changing costs ( e . g . , the cost of querying , or the cost of examining a search result snip - pet ) to changing search behaviours . Prior works in this area have focused on how users interact with a ranked list [ 12 , 38 ] , their stopping behaviours [ 34 , 52 ] , the trade - off between querying and This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution International 4 . 0 License .

In these aforementioned works , the SERP typically has a simple layout : the user can submit queries and assess documents . In addition , interface components ( hereafter referred to as widgets ) such as Related Searches are typi - cally considered to be placed at a fixed position , and their specific position is not part of the formal model definition . However , con - temporary SERPs are complex , and widgets can appear at various positions on the SERP as shown anecdotally in Table 1 : there is no consensus on positioning or size of the Related Searches wid - get across web search engines . In addition , contemporary SERPs contain direct answers ( leading to good abandonment [ 31 , 52 ] ) , ad - vertisements , and information cards‚Äîas well as result lists that integrate content from a number of different search verticals . In our work , we focus on an aspect of individual widgets on a SERP that‚Äîas already mentioned‚Äîhas so far been neglected in mathematical representations of user interaction : the positioning of a given widget on a SERP . With this focus , we selected one specific SERP widget to provide an initial exploration of how to incorporate widget positioning into a SET - based model . Concretely , we focus on the Query History Widget ( QHW ) , which is shown in Figure 3 . It allows a user to view and thus reflect upon their recently issued queries during a search session . The widget is easy to understand for users , and involves only a small number of interactions‚Äîmaking it ideal as a first widget to employ for our exploration . Our main research question is therefore as follows . RQ How can we incorporate widget positioning information in a SET - based model ? To answer this question , we first derive a SET - based model that considers a widget‚Äôs positioning as an input variable . Based on our formal model , we derive five hypotheses as to the search behaviour users are likely to exhibit as the widget‚Äôs positioning changes . Sub - sequently , in order to validate our model ( and therefore also the inclusion of the positioning component in the model ) , we conduct a user study with ùëÅ = 120 participants that each complete one ad - hoc retrieval task using a SERP with the QHW ‚Äîin one of five different positions 1 . We observe empirical evidence that provides partial support for three of our five hypotheses which shows that : ( i ) a widget‚Äôs location influences search behaviour ; and ( ii ) we are able to successfully create a formal interaction model , incorporating positioning , and mostly find evidence for our derived hypotheses . 1 An overview of the different widget positions we employ for our experiments is shown in Figure 3 .

Hypotheses can be derived from them , e . g . the optimal number of results ( ùíè per page ) to show to maximise a user‚Äôs benefit in the violet scenario is at the cost function‚Äôs global minimum . 2 MICROECONOMIC THEORY AND ( INTERACTIVE ) IR Many models of ISR have been defined in the past [ 1 , 8 ‚Äì 10 , 16 , 18 , 22 , 43 , 51 ] . They can generally be categorised into two groups : descriptive models [ 8 ‚Äì 10 , 16 , 22 , 51 ] and formal ( mathematical ) models [ 1 , 18 , 43 ] . The former provide us with intuitions and and a holistic view of a user‚Äôs search behaviour ( e . g . , with the Berrypicking model [ 8 ] , users pick through information patches‚Äîanalogous to people collecting berries ) . While they provide us with explanations of why searchers behave in a particular manner , they do not allow us to predict how a user‚Äôs search behaviour will change in response to changes to the SERP , the quality of the results , etc . For this step , formal models such as Search Economic Theory ( SET ) [ 1 , 2 ] , Information Foraging Theory ( IFT ) [ 42 ] or the Interactive Probability Ranking Principle ( iPRP ) [ 18 ] are required . With the increasing complexity of SERPs and the increasing amount of decisions users have to take during search episodes ( and thus the ever growing number of experimental variants one would have to explore when exploring new interface variants ) , being able to rely on formal models to explore promising areas of the user interface design space is vital for cost - effective and efficient iterations of novel search interfaces . A key assumption of the listed formal models ( which are related to each other as shown by Azzopardi and Zuccon [ 4 ] ) is that users will modify their search behaviour to achieve the greatest possible net benefit from an interaction which is defined as the difference between the benefit of interaction and the cost of interaction . Thus , modelling the cost and benefit of interactions taking place on typical SERPs‚Äîand subsequently validating the designed models through user studies ( or conversely finding that the proposed model is not sufficiently fine - grained enough to predict user behaviour well ) ‚Äî has been the focus of recent works in this area . Specifically , Azzopardi and Zuccon [ 5 ] created user - oriented cost - benefit models to analyse a number of user decisions ( includ - ing the length of the submitted query , the specificity of the query , the use of query suggestions vs . query reformulation , etc . ) that are made during a search session‚Äîand at what point those deci - sions lead to maximum user benefit . The authors focus on model creation ; the developed models are not empirically validated . In a similar vein , Azzopardi and Zuccon [ 6 ] developed a cost model to determine‚Äîfor various screen sizes ‚Äîthe number of search result snippets that should be visible on the SERP , under the assumption Session 1B - User Interaction ICTIR ‚Äô21 , July 11 , 2021 , Virtual Event , Canada 54 that a user is looking for a document , and continues looking until that document is found . The developed formal model was initialised with hyperparameter values ( such as the cost in seconds of typing out a character , or clicking a link ) taken from the literature . Based on the developed cost functions ( idealised examples of which are shown in Figure 1 ) , several hypotheses were created‚Äîthough their validation through a user study remained a point for future work . While this work already hinted at a distinction between desktop and mobile search ( via the very different number of visible results in the viewport ) , Verma and Yilmaz [ 49 ] explicitly tackled this challenge and empirically determined ( with 193 search sessions over ùëÅ = 25 participants ) to what extent existing user cost - benefit models are applicable ( without change ) to the mobile setting . The authors found that the parameters between desktop and mobile settings vary widely , and existing cost functions ( with fixed hy - perparameters , tuned to desktop search‚Äîand not adapted to the mobile setting ) do not correlate very well with user satisfaction . Using SET as their theoretical underpinning , Ong et al . [ 40 ] recently investigated the relationship between typing speed and search behaviour , both formally as well as empirically . While the authors did indeed observe a relationship between the two , they did find discrepancies between the observed user behaviours and those predicted by their model , conjecturing that their approximation of the model‚Äôs query cost ( by typing speed ) does not capture all impor - tant aspects of the query cost component . A similar methodology was used by Maxwell and Azzopardi [ 33 ] . Here , the authors derived five different hypotheses about how temporal delays ( both query response delays and document download delays ) affect search be - haviour . These hypotheses were derived from SET - and IFT - based models , respectively . Empirically ( with ùëÅ = 48 participants ) , three of the five hypotheses on user behaviours held . Prior works have successfully employed formal models to derive testable hypotheses of search behaviours . To the best of our knowl - edge , none of the prior works have however considered the position of a user interface widget as important enough to include in the derived model . In our work , we focus on this very issue : how does the position of a search interface widget impact the search behaviour our model predicts , and to what extent do those predictions hold when examining interaction data derived from a user study ? 3 CONSIDERING WIDGET POSITIONING In this section , we first discuss‚Äîat a high level‚Äîhow to incorporate the positioning of a widget within an interface in a SET - based model . We then introduce our implementation of the QHW in more detail , and present the cost functions for our specific widget use case . We conclude this section with a number of hypotheses we derive from our mathematical model regarding the influence of the QHW position on a user‚Äôs search behaviour . 3 . 1 Positioning based on Fitts‚Äô Law One way to consider the positioning of widgets within an interface‚Äî in a microeconomic cost model of interaction‚Äîis to estimate the time it will take for a user to find the widget on an interface / SERP from a given starting position . One way to approximate this is by using Fitts‚Äô Law [ 17 ] ‚Äîan established , robust model of human psychomotor behaviour which has been has been frequently applied Re - issue previous query ? ExamineQHW ? Inspect Present Results List Find QHW Assess Query List Click Query Find QB Type Query Select existing query from QHW ( Re ) typing a query ( into QB ) C Finding C Issuing = c clk + ( m + 1 ) * c typ C Finding C Assessing C Issuing = c clk ? ? N Y Y N Start End Figure 2 : Flowchart of the modelled querying process . Be - fore issuing each query , the user is presented with the choice of inspecting the QHW or typing in the query via the QB . Associated costs are outlined in ¬ß 3 . 2 . 1 . to computer and mobile interface design [ 25 , 30 , 46 ] . It states that the movement time for a user ( moving their cursor on screen from a source to some target ) is affected by the distance moved and the precision needed for such movement . The bigger and closer the target is , the easier it is to find and click . Shorter mouse movements are preferred , given that the object is large enough [ 46 ] . Therefore , given a search interface , the time taken to find a widget within a SERP is a function of its position and its size . In this work , Fitts‚Äô law is used as part of our SET - based user interaction model . 3 . 2 The Query History Widget ( QHW ) Let us now turn our attention to QHW , the interface widget that we developed the position - aware cost functions for . Shown in the callout in Figure 3 , the QHW lists all previously issued queries in a search session . Our model considers the following scenario . A user , after inspecting a retrieved list of documents presented on a SERP , decide to issue a different query . Do they : ( a ) reissue an old query ( i . e . , a query submitted earlier in the same search session , perhaps because they wish to find a document from earlier ) ; or ( b ) issue a new query ( i . e . , a query not yet submitted in the same search session , potentially leading to a new set of documents ) ? If the user decides to issue a new query , they will head to the query box ( QB ) , and type the new query . If the user decides to reissue an old query , they must then decide whether to : ( a ) re - type the query in the QB ; or ( b ) scan the QHW , find the old query , and click it . A flowchart of the process described is shown in Figure 2 . In this paper , we focus exclusively on the scenario where the user has decided to reissue an old query . We assume that the user knows they have issued this particular query in the past ( a reasonable assumption , given that we only consider queries from a single search session ) , and expects to find it in the QHW . We develop a formal model in order to predict and understand the scenario Session 1B - User Interaction ICTIR ‚Äô21 , July 11 , 2021 , Virtual Event , Canada 55 where they will choose to re - type this old query in the QB , or when they will select it from the QHW instead‚Äîall conditional on the position of the QHW on the SERP . Note that this work does not focus on the reasoning behind re - issuing a query from earlier . We leave this for future work . Rather , we aim here to integrate positional information within a SET - based interaction model . 3 . 2 . 1 Specifying Costs . The total cost ùê∂ Reissuing ( in seconds ) of re - issuing an old query ( that consists of ùëö characters , and is listed at position ùëû inside the QHW ) can be represented as three con - stituent components , as shown in the following equation . ùê∂ ùëÖùëíùëñùë†ùë†ùë¢ùëñùëõùëî = ùê∂ ùêπùëñùëõùëëùëñùëõùëî + ùê∂ ùê¥ùë†ùë†ùëíùë†ùë†ùëñùëõùëî + ùê∂ ùêºùë†ùë†ùë¢ùëñùëõùëî ( 1 ) ùê∂ ùêπùëñùëõùëëùëñùëõùëî is the cost of finding either the QHW or the QB . We ap - proximate the cost in terms of time taken ( in seconds ) . According to Fitts‚Äô Law [ 17 ] , the movement time of the mouse cursor from some starting position on a display to some target ( in this case , either the QHW or the QB ) is equal to ùëé + ùëè log 2 ( ùê∑ ùêª + 0 . 5 ) [ 11 , 27 ] , where ùê∑ is the distance to the centre of the widget from the starting position of the cursor , ùêª is the height of the widget ( in 2D interfaces , the smallest value from the target‚Äôs height or width is considered [ 32 ] ) , and ùëé , ùëè are constants that are empirically determined . Intuitively , the further the widget is from the starting position , the more time it will take for the users to find the widget . ùê∂ ùê¥ùë†ùë†ùëíùë†ùë†ùëñùëõùëî is the cost of assessing a widget . For QB , this cost is zero as users do not have to check a list of options . For QHW , it involves two actions : scrolling and checking . For example , consider that a user wants to find the ùëû ùë°‚Ñé query ( our target query ) in the QHW . We associate a constant cost ùëê ùë†ùëêùëü with scrolling over one query . Similarly , we associate a constant cost ùëê ùëê‚Ñéùëò with checking whether a query is the target query or not . Given that the QHW displays ùë° queries above the fold ( e . g . , in our experimental interface , as illustrated in Figure 3 , we fixed ùë° = 4 ) , if ùëû ‚â§ ùë° , then users do not incur any scrolling cost‚Äîand only the cost of checking to see if the query matches what they are seeking , or ùëû √ó ùëê ùëê‚Ñéùëò . However , if ùëû > ùë° , users then have to scroll until the desired query is visible . This cost can be estimated by ( ùëû ‚àí ùë° ) √ó ùëê ùë†ùëêùëü + ùëû √ó ùëê ùëê‚Ñéùëò , in line with [ 6 ] . ùê∂ ùêºùë†ùë†ùë¢ùëñùëõùëî is the cost associated with entering the query . For QB , it is the cost of typing the query of length ùëö ; this cost is ùëê ùëêùëôùëò + ( ùëö + 1 ) √ó ùëê ùë°ùë¶ùëù , where ùëê ùëêùëôùëò is the cost of clicking on the QB , ùëê ùë°ùë¶ùëù is the cost of typing one character and + 1 is included to account for the pressing of . For QHW , it is the cost ùëê ùëêùëôùëò of clicking on the desired query link . 2 3 . 2 . 2 When to use QHW . Based on the previous section , we can now write the cost functions ùê∂ QB ùëÖùëíùëñùë†ùë†ùë¢ùëñùëõùëî and ùê∂ QHW ùëÖùëíùëñùë†ùë†ùë¢ùëñùëõùëî : re - issuing an old query by typing into QB , and by selecting a query from the QHW , respectively . Based on our assumption of a rational user , we argue that a user will chose QB if the cost of using QB is less than the cost of using QHW . For completeness , we present both cost functions in Equations 2 and 3 below , as well as a short defi - nition of the corresponding symbols . For simplicity and neatness , we suppress the subscript from ùê∂ QB ùëÖùëíùëñùë†ùë†ùë¢ùëñùëõùëî and ùê∂ QHW ùëÖùëíùëñùë†ùë†ùë¢ùëñùëõùëî for now 2 While we have not yet described our implemented QHW widget in detail , we note that each old query is represented as a hyperlink ; clicking a hyperlink reissues the query and displays the results for it on the SERP . on , referring these costs simply as ùê∂ QB and ùê∂ QHW , respectively . Rational users should choose QB over QHW if ùê∂ QB < ùê∂ QHW . ùê∂ QB = ùëé + ùëè log 2 ( ùê∑ ùëÑùêµ ùêª ùëÑùêµ + 0 . 5 ) + ùëê ùëêùëôùëò + ( ùëö + 1 ) ¬∑ ùëê ùë°ùë¶ùëù ( 2 ) ùê∑ ùëÑùêµ = Distance of QB from starting position ùêª ùëÑùêµ = Height of query box ( in pixels ) ùëö = Query length ( in characters ) ùëê ùë°ùë¶ùëù = Cost of typing one character ùê∂ QHW = Ô£±Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£≤ Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£≥ ùëé + ùëè log 2 ( ùê∑ ùëÑùêªùëä ùêª ùëÑùêªùëä + 0 . 5 ) + ùëû ¬∑ ùëê ùëê‚Ñéùëò + ùëê ùëêùëôùëò , if ùëû ‚â§ ùë° ùëé + ùëè log 2 ( ùê∑ ùëÑùêªùëä ùêª ùëÑùêªùëä + 0 . 5 ) + ( ùëû ‚àí ùë° ) ùëê ùë†ùëêùëü + ùëû ¬∑ ùëê ùëê‚Ñéùëò + ùëê ùëêùëôùëò , if ùëû > ùë° ( 3 ) ùê∑ ùëÑùêªùëä = Distance of QHW from starting position ùêª ùëÑùêªùëä = Height of QHW ( in pixels ) ùëû = Position of the target query in QHW ùëê ùëê‚Ñéùëò = Cost of checking a query in QHW ùëê ùë†ùëêùëü = Cost of scrolling over a query in QHW ùëê ùëêùëôùëò = Cost of clicking a hyperlink in QHW 3 . 2 . 3 Constants . In our model , the above inequality depends not only on the positioning of QHW , but also on the value of a few constants . These are : the cost of clicking ( ùëê ùëêùëôùëò ) ; scrolling ( ùëê ùë†ùëüùëê ) ; typ - ing ( ùëê ùë°ùë¶ùëù ) ; checking ( ùëê ùëê‚Ñéùëò ) queries ; the sizes of both QB ( ùêª ùëÑùêµ ) and QHW ( ùêª ùëÑ ùêªùëä ) ; the number of queries above the fold ( ùë° ) ; the distance from the bottom of the screen to QB ( ùê∑ ùëÑùêµ ) ; and the con - sidered starting point of the cursor . In order to derive meaningful hypotheses from our inequality and use the model to predict actual user behaviour , we need to provide meaningful estimates of these constants . We can either estimate them directly from the interaction logs we collect in our user study , or fix their values based on studies reported in the literature in line with [ 4 , 6 ] . For example , the typical values of pertaining are shown in Table 2 where we take ùëê ùë°ùë¶ùëù , ùëê ùë†ùëêùëü , ùëê ùëêùëôùëò and the hyperparameter ùëè from the literature . We note that ùëé ‚Äîdefined in Equations 2 and 3‚Äîis cancelled in our comparison , and thus is ignored . In order to make use of the model , we also need to define certain other constants like distance of QB , or the height of QHW , etc . ‚Äîwhich we also report in Table 2 . We need these precise values to predict real world behavior by calculating the exact cost of each decision . We leave this as future work . In this paper , we focus on using the general intuition behind the model equations to derive hypotheses of user interaction . 4 HYPOTHESES Having defined our model in Equations 2 and 3‚Äîalong with all associated constants , we now derive five hypotheses pertaining to the query issuing behaviour that the model describes , and how position can influence search behaviours . H1 As the length of query ùëû to be reissued increases , a user will be more likely to reissue the query via QHW .

As ùëö ( the length of query ùëû in characters ) increases , ùê∂ QB increases . At the same time , ùëö does not influence ùê∂ QHW . H2 If the number of queries to check in QHW increases , a user‚Äôs likelihood of using QHW increases as its distance to the starting point decreases . In Equation 3 we see that , if ùëû increases , ùê∑ ùëÑùêªùëä has to decrease to keep the overall cost of using QHW lower than that of QB . H3 The lower the distance of the QHW to the starting point , the more likely users are to use it . This follows from Equation 3 where , everything else being constant , the cost of reissuing a query is lowest when ùê∑ ùëÑùêªùëä = 0 . H4 Users who type more slowly are more likely to use the QHW irrespective of where it is located . In ¬ß 3 . 2 . 3 , we provided fixed estimates for various constants in our model . One of those estimates is the cost of typing a character . Since the typing speed of users might vary to a considerable degree [ 40 ] , the typing cost should be subject to further scrutiny . A user with slower typing will have a higher cost of typing queries , which will likely affect what widget they will use to reissue a query . For slow typing , ùëê ùë°ùë¶ùëù is high , and ùê∂ QB becomes higher than ùê∂ QHW for all reasonable values of ùê∑ ùëÑùêªùëä and ùëû . Hence , with slow typing , the positioning of QHW is less crucial‚Äîor how many queries are present in it , as a user is more likely to use QHW anyway . H5 A user‚Äôs attention follows a F - shaped gaze pattern . This pattern has been observed on heterogeneous SERPs in the past [ 15 ] and should be reflected in the amount of attention users pay to the QHW in different positions . Specifically , the interface with QHW in the top right corner of the screen is likely to receive more attention than QHW positioned at the bottom right corner . Similarly , QHW in the bottom left corner is likely to receive less attention than QHW in the top left part of the screen . 5 USER STUDY DESIGN In order to examine whether there is support for our hypotheses , we conducted a between - subjects user study . Participants were presented with a SERP that was complemented with the QHW in different positions , depending on the condition they were assigned . 5 . 1 System , Corpus , Topic and Task For our user study we employed SearchX [ 44 ] , a modular , open - source search framework which provides quality control features for crowdsourcing experiments . We integrated the Log UI frame - work [ 36 ] into SearchX to allow us to accurately capture all key - board events and mouse events ( including hovers and clicks ) over QB , QHW , and results . SearchX was configured to use the TREC AQUAINT corpus . The corpus consists of over one million newspaper articles from the period 1996 ‚àí 2000 . Articles were gathered from three newswires : the Associated Press ( AP ) , the New York Times ( NYT ) , and Xinhua . Using a traditional test collection provided us with the ability to easily evaluate the performance of participants where required . We index the collection using Indri , and use its own snippet generator for the summaries presented to participants . We employed Indri‚Äôs Dirichlet prior smoothing model ( with ùúá = 2500 ) . We used the wildlife extinction topic ( topic number 347 ) from the TREC 2005 Robust Track [ 50 ] . A total of 165 relevant doc - uments were identified by TREC assessors for this topic within AQUAINT . This topic was selected it as it has been successfully employed in prior user studies [ 3 , 33 ] ; the topic remains relevant to this day , and is likely to be of some interest to our participants . We instructed our participants to identify documents that they perceived to be relevant to the TREC topic description that we Session 1B - User Interaction ICTIR ‚Äô21 , July 11 , 2021 , Virtual Event , Canada 57 provided to them . We primed our participants by asking them to imagine that they were to write an essay on the topic , and would use the identified documents as potential references at a later time . 5 . 2 Interface and Incentives Our search interface is presented in Figure 3 . It contains : the stan - dard query box QB ( without autocompletion features ) 1 ; a task timer and a bookmarked - documents counter 2 ; six search results per page ( RPP ) 3 ; functionality to mark documents in the form of a toggle icon 4 ; and QHW 5 . As we were looking to incentivise participants to reissue existing queries , special considerations needed to be made to this effect‚Äî along with considering that the search interface used should be kept simple to avoid any undue attention given to components that were not considered by our model defined in ¬ß 3 . 2 . We evaluated our incentives in a small pilot study before deploying them to our study participants . Results from the pilot study are not included in our final analysis . Participants were instructed that they could mark no more than six documents at a time . The marked documents counter helped participants to keep track of their number of marked documents . The idea behind this was that a strict limit on how many docu - ments could be marked would incentivise participants when issuing queries later on in their search session ( either via QB or QHW ) to unmark previously marked documents ( by toggling the icon ) ‚Äîand mark new ones that they perceived to be more promising . Partici - pants were incentivised further by the potential for a bonus being awarded to the top six participants who achieved a high accuracy . Before the study commenced , the participant‚Äôs screen resolution was checked‚Äîa resolution check ensured that the resolution of the browser was 1920 √ó 1080 or greater . This resolution was found to show ( with a high degree of certainty ) that the entire search interface could fit on the participant‚Äôs screen without the need for scrolling , meaning all six RPP were displayed , with none hidden below the fold . It also helped us to estimate the value of ùê∑ ùëÑùêµ as presented in Table 2 . There is also no pagination enabled on the SERP . These are due to the fact that our model does not include page scrolling 3 or pagination , factors that could alter user behaviour . To this end , we also removed any hyperlinks to documents . To compensate , we increased the number of lines for each summary snippet from the established two to four . While longer snippets have been shown to increase confidence in decisions of relevance at the expense of accuracy [ 35 ] , it was decided that additional surrogate text in this instance would help participants in judging documents without access to the full text . 5 . 3 Operationalising the QHW We operationalised the QHW as shown in the callout in Figure 3 . The widget measures 450 √ó 130 pixels . At the top of the widget is the Recent queries title . Each query issued by the participant during the study is then prepended to the list shown in the lower portion of the widget . Queries are listed in reverse chronological order , with the most recently issued query appearing at the top . As the QHW has a fixed width and height on the SERP , the widget could display at most four queries at a time , matching ùë° = 4 3 It does however consider scrolling costs within QHW . as outlined in ¬ß 3 . 2 . 1 . Participants who wished to see more queries could scroll using their trackpad or mouse wheel to reveal older queries . All queries listed in the QHW were displayed as the stan - dard blue hyperlink text‚Äîwhich underlines when hovered over‚Äîto provide a proximal cue [ 14 ] that they were hyperlinks that could be clicked . A click on the listed query then submits the listed query to the search engine , and displays the top six ranked documents . In terms of positioning within the SERP , we trialled five different positions which are demonstrated in Figure 3 with blue boxes . Anecdotal evidence as presented in Table 1 suggests that there is no clearly defined position for widgets on a SERP ( beyond the search results and entity cards ) , and thus we evaluated the major positions . Each of our five QHW positions ( three on the left rail and two on the right ) are represented in our user study as a unique condition . TOP - LEFT Positioned at the top left , before the first result . MIDDLE - LEFT Positioned on the left rail , below the third result . BOTTOM - LEFT Positioned at the bottom left , immediately after the sixth and final result . UPPER - RIGHT On the right rail , this condition positioned QHW underneath the clock ; it is top - aligned with the first result . This position would be analogous to where an entity card sits on a contemporary web search engine‚Äôs SERP . LOWER - RIGHT On the right rail , this condition positioned QHW under the clock ; it is aligned at the bottom with the last result . 5 . 4 Post - Task Survey Inspired by the User Experience Questionnaire ( UEQ - S ) [ 20 , 29 ] , we asked participants five questions after the completion of the search task which . Questions explored the usage experience of the QHW . All questions were answered using a 7 - point Likert scale , consider - ing negative to positive responses . For example , to understand to what extent a widget positioning was unexpected for the participant , we ask ‚ÄúWhat did you think about the position of the query history widget ? ‚Äù , with the scale ranging from unexpected ( 1 ) to expected ( 7 ) . Additionally , we ask about the support , ease of use , efficiency & clarity of the widget . Participants also received an open question for general comments and feedback about the interface . 5 . 5 Crowdsourced Participants Participants for our study were recruited from Prolific , a crowd - sourcing platform which has been shown to be an effective choice for complex and time - consuming Interactive Information Retrieval ( IIR ) experiments [ 53 ] . In order to obtain high - quality and reliable data , we imposed the following constraints : ( i ) participants needed to have at least 100 prior Prolific submissions ; ( ii ) have an approval rate of 95 % or higher ; and ( iii ) have native proficiency in English . The complete study took approximately fifteen minutes , which included the minimum search time of 10 minutes . For their time , participants were compensated at the rate of GBP¬£8 . 00 per hour . Overall , a total of 125 participants took part in our study . From this total , we had to reject five as they did not comply with our quality checks 4 . Our final cohort of 120 participants included 40 4 Our quality checks required that participants did not change the browser tab more than three times during the study , issued at least two queries , and marked at least two documents during their search session . Session 1B - User Interaction ICTIR ‚Äô21 , July 11 , 2021 , Virtual Event , Canada 58 female and 80 males ones , with a reported average age of 35 years ( youngest 18 ; oldest 77 ) . 6 RESULTS We now discuss the empirical validation of each of our five hypothe - ses which were introduced in ¬ß 4 . Recall that our research question asks whether widget positioning information can be meaningfully incorporated in a SET - based model . A comparison of the main search behaviour indicators across conditions is shown in Table 3 . On average , participants issued 12 queries ( 28 characters long ) ‚Äîand marked six documents , hitting the imposed limit ) . 114 participants reissued 5 queries on average , while six did not reissue any queries ( either via QB or QHW ) . On average our participants spent 12 minutes on the search task . We collected , on average , 2148 log events per participant . Additionally , we also measured how the participants behaved regarding marking documents . On average , participants marked 2 . 60 relevant documents during their session , and 5 . 10 non - relevant documents . As expected , participants also unmarked documents over their session , indicating that they were actually reflecting on what they had marked . On average , participants unmarked 1 . 70 documents , where 1 . 15 of these were non - relevant . The results of our post - task survey indicate that our interface was easy to use ( Table 3 , row XV : on average a score above 5 on a 7 - point Likert scale ) , and the purpose of the QHW was clear ( row XVII : on average a score above 5 ) . Apart from MIDDLE - LEFT , which received a comparably low and significantly worse expected posi - tion score than almost all other variants ( the only exception being LOWER - RIGHT ) , the QHW variants were positioned at somewhat expected locations ( Table 3 , row XIII : on average a score above 4 on the 7 - point Likert scale ) . These numbers indicate that our task design ( which encouraged the reissuing of queries ) was successful . Finally , we point the reader to Figure 3 for examples of actual queries our participants sub - mitted ( as visible in the QHW callout ) . We also considered 6 from Figure 3 as the expected starting point where the cursor is positioned after they have scanned the search results . From this location , they move the cursor to QHW or QB to ( re ) issue queries . We argue that it is reasonable to expect individuals to examine all six results on the SERP before moving on . Coupled with the known correlation of eye gaze and cursor positioning on the screen [ 13 ] , this assumption allows us to make estimations of ùê∑ ùëÑùêµ and ùê∑ ùëÑùêªùëä in Equations 2 and 3 . 6 . 1 H1 : Query Length Hypothesis H1 states that as the length of some query to reis - sue increases , the likelihood of reissuing the query via QHW ‚Äî independent of the widget‚Äôs position‚Äîincreases . To investigate H1 , we consider all 590 reissued queries across all participants and con - ditions . Queries were partitioned into four groups ( with boundaries at the 25 th / 50 th / 75 th percentiles ) , according to their length ùëö in characters‚Äî [ 1 , 18 ] , [ 19 , 25 ] , [ 26 , 33 ] and [ 34 , ‚àû ] ‚Äîand determined the fraction of queries reissued via QB and QHW . Results are shown in Figure 4 . We find that for the shortest reissued queries ( with ùëö < 19 ) , 74 % of queries are reissued via QHW , while this percentage rises to 94 % for the longest ( ùëö > 33 ) queries . This Query Length ( Characters ) P e r ce n t a g e o f Q u e r i es 100 [ 1 , 18 ] 102 queries [ 19 , 25 ] 174 queries [ 26 , 33 ] 159 queries [ 34 , ‚àû ] 155 queries = 590 queries 80 60 40 20 0 % QB % QHW 5 . 8 94 . 2 88 . 5 11 . 5 10 . 3 26 . 5 73 . 5 89 . 7 Figure 4 : Overview of QHW vs . QB usage when reissuing queries of varying lengths . Shown here are the results over 590 reissued queries across all participants / conditions . trend provides support for H1 : participants prefer to use QHW for reissuing queries , and do so with a greater likelihood as query length increases . In order to observe if the trend is significant , we sampled one random reissued query from each participant to make the observations in the four query groups independent . A Chi - square test revealed that there is significant difference across the four query groups ( ùúí 2 ( 3 , ùëÅ = 114 ) = 10 . 58 , ùëù = 0 . 01 ) . Post - hoc tests showed that there were significant differences in the number of queries issued via QHW between queries belonging to the 3 larger size groups when compared to the group representing smaller queries . However , there was no significant difference among the three groups representing larger queries . We therefore find partial support to our hypothesis that people are more likely to use the QHW to reissue queries as query length increases . 6 . 2 H2 : Query Positioning in the QHW H2 centres around the number of queries in QHW . The hypothesis states that as the number of issued queries increases , the likelihood of a participant using QHW increases as the widget‚Äôs distance to the starting point ( 6 in Figure 3 ) decreases . We rank the five QHW positions ( conditions ) we explore empirically according to their distance from the point on the screen where we expect the participant‚Äôs cursor to be after they have scanned all six results . This information is shown in row II of Table 3 . The positions are ranked as follows : ( 1 ) BOTTOM - LEFT ; ( 2 ) MIDDLE - LEFT ; ( 3 ) LOWER - RIGHT ; ( 4 ) TOP - LEFT ; and ( 5 ) UPPER - RIGHT . From our interaction logs , we also calculated the position in the QHW for a reissued query . As discussed in ¬ß 5 . 3 , queries are displayed in reverse chronological order , which means if users have to scan further down the list , they are looking for an older query to reissue . We collected the ranks of all reissued queries ( 590 queries in total ) , and divided them into two groups based on how many queries are displayed above the fold in QHW ‚Äîreissued queries with a position of four or less ( 340 queries ) and those with a rank greater than four ( 250 queries ) . Table 3 , row XI shows that on average , participants are more likely to reissue a query when it is present below the fold from the conditions where QHW was positioned closer to the starting position ( as observed in row II ) . Moreover , when participants want to reissue a recent Session 1B - User Interaction ICTIR ‚Äô21 , July 11 , 2021 , Virtual Event , Canada 59 Table 3 : Mean ( ¬± standard deviation ) of search behaviour metrics across all participants in each variation of QHW .

The only exception is the farthest variant UPPER - RIGHT , where the likelihood of reissuing is similar for both recent and older queries . To observe if this trend showing evidence for our hypothesis is significant , we conducted a Chi - squared test following a similar approach to H1 . We sample two reissued queries ( one above and one below the fold of QHW ) from each participant , and observe that for queries lower down the list ( below the fold ) in QHW ( row XI ) , there is a significant difference for the fraction of time it was reissued via QHW across conditions ( ùúí 2 ( 4 , ùëÅ = 89 ) = 9 . 14 , ùëù = 0 . 02 ) . Post - hoc tests revealed significant differences between BOTTOM - LEFT and MIDDLE - LEFT in comparison to the UPPER - RIGHT condition . There was no significant difference when the query was present above the fold in QHW ( ùúí 2 ( 4 , ùëÅ = 114 ) = 3 . 86 , ùëù = 0 . 42 ) . Since we do not find a significant difference across all variants for queries reissued via QHW below the fold , we can only claim our hypothesis has been partially supported . 6 . 3 H3 : Distance of the QHW H3 states that with decreasing distance of the QHW to the starting point , the higher its usage . As mentioned in H2 , row II of Table 3 shows the distance of each condition of QHW from where we expect a participant‚Äôs mouse cursor to be after scanning results ( 6 from Figure 3 ) . We observe from row IV of Table 3 that there is no significant difference ( ùêπ ( 4 , 115 ) = 0 . 544 , ùëù = 0 . 7 ) in the number of reissued queries via QHW between the conditions . We do however observe a trend : participants in the two conditions closest to the starting point ( BOTTOM - LEFT and MIDDLE - LEFT ) issued on average more than five queries via QHW ; in the other three conditions , participants issued on average fewer than four queries via QHW . Finally , it is worth mentioning that our QHW widget has the intended effect : reissued queries are far more likely to come via QHW than QB whose usage for reissued queries is shown in row V of Table 3 . On average , fewer than one reissued query per participant is submitted via QB . Based on these results we cannot argue in favour of H3 , even though the data trend is aligned with our hypothesis , the differences are not significant . 6 . 4 H4 : Slow Typing H4 states that participants who type slower incur a higher typ - ing cost , and are likely to prefer to use QHW irrespective of its position on screen . From our interaction logs , we computed the mean typing speed of our participants ( we considered 114 users who reissued at least one previous query ) by averaging the total time they took to type a query by the query length . Subsequently , we performed a median split ( 0 . 323 seconds per character ) of our participants based on their mean typing speed , and categorised them as Slow and Fast at typing . In rows IX and X of Table 3 , we report the fraction of times reissued queries were issued via QHW by Slow and Fast partici - pants , respectively . Across all conditions , we find , on average , Slow participants relied on QHW more often than those in Fast . For example , in the UPPER - RIGHT condition , 95 % of reissued queries on average were submitted via QHW over Slow ; the value was 78 % for Fast . The smallest difference in behaviour is observed for the BOTTOM - LEFT condition : here , Slow reissue on average 93 % of queries via QHW , while Fast reissue 90 % via QHW . In addition , we find Fast to exhibit more diverse behaviour than Slow as in - dicated by the standard deviations reported in rows IX and X of Table 3 . This shows that participants in Slow rely on QHW more consistently than Fast . There is no significant difference for the Session 1B - User Interaction ICTIR ‚Äô21 , July 11 , 2021 , Virtual Event , Canada 60 fraction of time a query was reissued via QHW by Slow ( row IX ) . Although this finding is in line with our hypothesis , we do not see any significant difference over Fast ( X ) . We thus cannot claim to have support for H4 . 6 . 5 H5 : F - Shaped Gaze Pattern H5 is not derived from our formal model , but instead based on prior works that have found users to pay attention to SERPs in a particular manner : the top - left part of the SERP receives the most attention , and attention decreases as one goes down the SERP on the left rail , and to the right rail . We hypothesise here that we can find a similar attention pattern for the different positions of QHW . Contrasting to Dumais et al . [ 15 ] where gaze patterns were recorded via eye trackers , we did not perform webcam - based eye tracking and thus have to rely on other interaction logs to esti - mate attention . As found by Rodden et al . [ 45 ] , eye gaze and mouse movements are correlated . We thus approximate how much at - tention participants were paying to QHW variants via the mean number of hover and scrolling events over QHW based on our interaction data 5 . We only consider hover events that spanned at least 500ms . We make this choice as variants MIDDLE - LEFT and TOP - LEFT , due to their location , would fall ‚Äòin the way‚Äô of partici - pants performing other tasks , like marking a document , or moving to QB ‚Äîconsidering all hover events would have skewed the interac - tion data . We observe significant differences across QHW variants for these two hover - based ( ùêπ ( 4 , 115 ) = 41 . 4 , ùëù = 0 . 003 ) and scroll events ( ùêπ ( 4 , 115 ) = 39 . 6 , ùëù = 0 . 01 ) which are reported in Table 3 ( rows VII and VIII ) . Post - hoc tests revealed that the UPPER - RIGHT conditionreceives significantlyfewerhovers orscrolls ( and thus less attention ) than MIDDLE - LEFT , TOP - LEFT and BOTTOM - LEFT . Thus , attention decreases as we move to the right . In contrast , we do not confirm our hypothesis that attention decreases as users move down the screen : the TOP - LEFT and BOTTOM - LEFT conditions do not significantly differ in terms of our hover / scroll measures . Overall , we have partial evidence for hypothesis H5 : participants pay less attention to the right side of the screen as approximated by our hover / scroll measures , but this attention decrease is not observed as we move towards the bottom of the screen . Of course , it should be noted that we designed the interface in such a way that participants were able to see the entire SERP at once without the need to scroll and see below the fold . 7 CONCLUSIONS In this work , we set out to answer the question of how to incorporate interface positioning information in a SET - based model . To this end , we derived a position - aware interaction model of search behaviour . We focused on the Query History Widget ( QHW ) , and formulated a model that can predict search behaviour related to the reissuing of queries from the same search session . We used Fitts‚Äô Law [ 17 ] to approximate the cost of finding the widget based on its five different positions on the screen . Based on our model and prior works , we de - veloped five testable hypotheses . We conducted a between - subjects user study with ùëÅ = 120 participants . We evaluated the impact of the position of QHW on search behaviour . 5 We are aware of more advanced approaches to estimate gaze patterns from mouse movements , e . g . [ 19 ] ‚Äîbut leave this exploration for future work . Of our five hypotheses , we found partial support for three . H1 As the length of the to - be - reissued query increases , a user will be more likely to reissue the query via the QHW . H2 If the number of queries to check in the QHW increases , the likelihood of users using the QHW increases as its distance to the starting point decreases . H5 A user‚Äôs attention span follows a F - shaped gaze pattern . For the remaining two hypotheses‚Äîconsidering the relationship of the distance of QHW to the starting point and the widget‚Äôs usage ( H3 ) , as well as the impact of typing speed on QHW ‚Äôs usage ( H4 ) ‚Äîwe observed trends aligned with our hypotheses . However , those trends were not statistically significant . Our empirical study therefore did not provide support for them . Overall we argue that we successfully developed a position - aware interaction model of search behaviour . We did find that wid - get positioning plays a role and changes a user‚Äôs search behaviour , and thus position matters ‚Äîand should be incorporated into formal interaction models . Our model is purposefully simple and does not capture every possible facet of user interaction with a SERP and its widgets . Several additions and modifications can be made . Generalisation We focused on a simplified use case of a single widget ( the QHW ) . However , a modern search interface often contains multiple complex widgets simultaneously . Therefore , we aim to extend our work by creating user interaction models for more complex decisions pertaining to other widgets . Cognitive effort Currently , our model ignores the cognitive cost of typing a query or looking for a query from a list present in the QHW . Modelling cognitive costs is not trivial and depends on , amongst other factors , the search phase the user is currently in , a user‚Äôs prior knowledge‚Äîand task difficulty . Layout and Graphics We have assumed that only the location of the QHW and QB impact the cost of finding these widgets . However , it has been shown that during web navigation , there is a difference between ease of finding a graphical widget ( e . g . , a shopping basket in an e - commerce website or a search box ) versus one that is textual ( e . g . , various text hyperlinks in navigation menus ) [ 21 , 23 ] . The graphical properties of these widgets , like size , shape , colour , and highlights , can also impact the efficiency in finding links and widgets [ 21 , 24 , 41 , 47 ] . They likely provide certain cues [ 14 ] that users latch onto . Usability and Aesthetics Based on our current model , a widget that takes 90 % of the SERP would be straightforward for a user to find . However , it would also make the whole user experience unpleasant at best . Therefore , modelling user interactions with multiple widgets could help us strike a balance to optimise the complete user experience . Prior works focusing on developing aesthetic measures ( i . e . , based on colour and symmetry ) for wid - gets can also help develop a more nuanced model [ 39 , 54 ] . Input Devices Our model assumes that the user interacts with a search engine in a standard browser , using a mouse and keyboard . However , this is not always the case . Extending our model to other types of interfaces like mobile and voice search ( building on existing work [ 28 ] ) is another interesting research venue to explore in future work .
