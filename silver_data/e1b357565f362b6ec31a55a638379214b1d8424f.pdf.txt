While several studies in the literature have attempted to empirically test how accurately a BTL model can model some given pairwise comparison data , this work aims to develop a formal , computationally efficient hypothesis test to determine whether the BTL model accurately represents the data . Specifically , we first propose such a formal hypothesis test , establish an upper bound on the critical radius of the proposed test , and then provide a complementary lower bound on the critical radius . Our bounds prove the minimax optimality of the scaling of the critical radius with respect to the number of items ( up to constant factors ) . Finally , we also take the first step towards characterizing the stability of rankings under the BTL model when there is a small model mismatch . I . I NTRODUCTION Many applications , such as sports tournaments , consumer preference surveys , and political voting , generate data in the form of pairwise comparisons between a set of items or agents ( e . g . , choices , teams ) . These datasets are useful for performing various data analysis tasks , such as ranking the items , analyzing the skill level of a particular team over time , and examining market or sports competitiveness , cf . [ 1 ] – [ 15 ] . A popular modeling assumption to perform such learning and inference tasks is the Bradley - Terry - Luce ( BTL ) model [ 1 ] – [ 6 ] . The BTL model assigns a latent skill score α i > 0 to each item i , representing its relative merit compared to other items , and posits that the likelihood of i being preferred over an item j in a pairwise comparison is given by P ( i is preferred over j ) = α i α i + α j . ( 1 ) The BTL model is a natural consequence of the assump - tion of independence of irrelevant alternatives ( IIA ) , which is widely used in economics and social choice theory [ 2 ] . Despite its widespread popularity , it is known that the IIA assumption does not hold well for various real - world datasets [ 16 ] – [ 18 ] . For example , the BTL model is oblivious to the “home - advantage effect” in sports , which refers to a home team’s possible advantage when playing against a visiting team ( see , e . g . , cricket [ 19 ] , soccer [ 20 ] ) . Hence , several other models of pairwise comparisons have been proposed in the literature , e . g . , modifications of the BTL model to incorporate home - advantage effect [ 21 , Chapter 10 ] , Thurstonian models [ 3 ] , other generalizations of the BTL model [ 7 ] , models of The author ordering is alphabetical . rankings based on Borda scores [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] , and other non - parametric stochastically transitive models [ 24 ] , [ 25 ] . Nevertheless , primarily because of its simplicity and in - terpretability , the BTL framework remains one of the most widely - used models . A large fraction of the associated results in the literature focuses on estimation of the skill score parameters of the BTL model . Some popular approaches include maximum likelihood estimation [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] , rank central - ity ( or Markov - chain - based ) methods [ 10 ] , [ 26 ] , least - squares methods [ 13 ] , and non - parametric methods [ 12 ] , [ 24 ] ( also see [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] for Bayesian inference for BTL models ) . Once the parameters are estimated , they are then used for inference tasks , such as ranking items and learning skill distributions [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] . An inherent assumption for such statistical analysis to be meaningful in real - world scenarios is that the BTL model accurately represents the given pairwise comparison data . Hence , it is important to understand precisely when the BTL assumption holds in a systematic manner . A . Main Contributions In contrast to the above works , we focus on the problem of testing whether the BTL assumption accurately models data generated from an underlying pairwise comparison model . First , we devise a notion of “distance” that allows us to quantify the deviation of a general pairwise comparison model from BTL models . We then use this distance to formally construct a hypothesis test to determine whether a BTL model accurately models the underlying data . We establish an upper bound on the minimax critical radius for this test . Furthermore , we also prove an information theoretic lower bound on the critical radius for this problem , thereby demonstrating the minimax optimality of the critical radius . Finally , we utilize the notion of distance mentioned above to analyze the stability of BTL assumptions in the context of rankings . More specifically , we investigate the deviation from the BTL condition that is sufficient for the ranking produced under the BTL assumption to differ from the classical Borda count ranking [ 27 ] . B . Related Literature This work lies at the confluence of two fields of study : hypothesis testing and preference learning . The analysis of preference data , such as pairwise comparisons , has a rich history starting from the seminal works [ 1 ] – [ 6 ] . As mentioned earlier , the BTL model is one of the most well - studied models for pairwise comparison data [ 1 ] . It was first proposed by [ 6 ] as a method for estimating participants’ skill levels in chess 2023 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory ( ISIT ) 978 - 1 - 6654 - 7554 - 9 / 23 / $ 31 . 00 ©2023 IEEE 1390 2023 I EEE I n t e r n a ti on a l S y m po s i u m on I n f o r m a ti on T h e o r y ( I S I T ) | 978 - 1 - 6654 - 7554 - 9 / 23 / $ 31 . 00 © 2023 I EEE | DO I : 10 . 1109 / I S I T 54713 . 2023 . 10206450 Authorized licensed use limited to the terms of the applicable license agreement with IEEE . Restrictions apply . tournaments . Moreover , it is a special case of the Plackett - Luce model [ 2 ] , [ 4 ] , initially developed in mathematical psychology . We refer readers to [ 28 ] , [ 29 ] for a comprehensive overview of different models of rankings . In the literature , many studies have focused on estimating parameters for the BTL model and characterizing the error bounds , cf . [ 7 ] , [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] , [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] , [ 30 ] – [ 32 ] . For example , [ 11 ] presents non - asymptotic bounds for relative ℓ ∞ and ℓ 2 - norm estimation errors of normalized vectors of skill scores . We use some of these bounds in our arguments , although we need to make alterations since the proofs do not apply to general pairwise comparison models . Hypothesis testing also has a rich history in statistics , ranging from Pearson’s χ 2 - test [ 33 ] to non - parametric tests [ 34 ] . Yet , to the best of our knowledge , no study has developed rigorous hypothesis tests to determine the validity of the BTL assumption in the literature . The minimax perspective of hypothesis testing , which we specialize in our setting , was initially proposed by [ 35 ] . It is worth mentioning that recently , [ 36 ] analyzed two - sample testing on pairwise comparison data , and [ 37 ] derived lower bounds for testing the IIA assumption given general preference data . For the special case of pairwise comparisons , the lower bounds in [ 37 ] agree with ours in terms of the high - level scaling law of the critical radius . However , our hypothesis testing problem is formulated differently to [ 37 ] and [ 37 ] does not provide upper bounds . Furthermore , investigating the stability of the BTL assump - tion is another interesting question in the literature . For exam - ple , [ 22 ] provided empirical evidence that the BTL assumption is not very robust to changes in the pairwise comparison matrix . So , in this work , we also take the first steps towards rigorously characterizing the stability of rankings under the BTL model . II . F ORMAL S ETUP AND D ECISION R ULE A . Notational Preliminaries We briefly collect some notation here that is used throughout this work . Let 1 n ∈ R n be the column vector with all entries equal to 1 , where we drop the subscript when it is clear from context , and [ n ] ≜ { 1 , . . . , n } . Furthermore , for any vector x ∈ R n , diag ( x ) ∈ R n × n is the diagonal matrix with x along its principal diagonal . For a vector x ∈ R n , ∥ x ∥ 2 denotes its ℓ 2 - norm and x p denotes the entry - wise p th power of x , i . e . , x p = [ x p 1 , x p 2 , · · · , x pn ] T . For any matrix A ∈ R n × n , ∥ A ∥ 2 and ∥ A ∥ F denote the operator norm and Frobenious norm of A , respectively . For a strictly positive vector π ∈ R n , we define a Hilbert space on R n with inner product ⟨ x , y ⟩ π = (cid:80) ni = 1 π i x i y i and the corresponding vector and matrix norms ∥ x ∥ π = (cid:112) ⟨ x , x ⟩ π and ∥ A ∥ π = sup ∥ x ∥ π = 1 ∥ Ax ∥ π and ∥ A ∥ π , F = (cid:0) (cid:80) i (cid:80) j π j A 2 ij (cid:1) 1 / 2 . B . Formal Model and Goal We begin by introducing general pairwise comparison mod - els . Consider a set of n agents , indexed by [ n ] with n ∈ N \ { 1 } , that engage in a tournament consisting of several pairwise comparisons . This scenario is ubiquitous in many real - world applications . For example , in a sports tournament , [ n ] rep - resents the teams or players that play pairwise games with each other , and in discrete choice models from economics , [ n ] represents alternatives that an individual may choose from . Several probabilistic models exist in the literature to capture such pairwise comparison settings , e . g . , BTL model [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , [ 5 ] , Thurstonian models [ 3 ] , and non - parametric models [ 24 ] , [ 25 ] , and all of them turn out to be specializations of the following general pairwise comparison model . Definition 1 ( Pairwise Comparison Model ) : For any pair of agents i , j ∈ [ n ] , i ̸ = j , let p ij ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) denote the probability that agent j beats agent i in a “i vs . j” pairwise comparison . We refer to the collection of n ( n − 1 ) parameters { p ij : i , j ∈ [ n ] , i ̸ = j } as a pairwise comparison model . Specifically , we consider an asymmetric setting where an “ i vs . j ” comparison may have a different meaning to a “ j vs . i ” comparison . Such asymmetric settings are commonly observed in sports like cricket , football , etc . [ 19 ] . Hence , such a model can be aptly summarized by a matrix P ∈ R n × n with P ij = (cid:40) p ij , i ̸ = j , 12 , i = j , ( 2 ) where we have set P ii = 12 for notational convenience . In our analysis , we will find it convenient to assign a time - homogenous Markov chain ( or row stochastic matrix ) on the finite state space [ n ] to any pairwise comparison model . This canonical assignment is defined next . Definition 2 ( Canonical Markov Chain ) : For any pairwise comparison model { p ij ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) : i , j ∈ [ n ] , i ̸ = j } with matrix P ∈ R n × n , its canonical Markov chain is given by the row stochastic matrix S ∈ R n × n , where S ij =   p ij n , i ̸ = j , 1 − 1 n (cid:88) k ∈ [ n ] \ { i } p ik , i = j . As noted earlier , the most well - known specialization of the pairwise comparison model in Definition 1 is the BTL model defined below [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , [ 5 ] . Definition 3 ( BTL Model [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , [ 5 ] ) : A pairwise com - parison model { p ij ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) : i , j ∈ [ n ] , i ̸ = j } is known as a BTL ( or multinomial logit ) model if there exist skill score parameters α i > 0 for every agent i ∈ [ n ] such that : ∀ i , j ∈ [ n ] , i ̸ = j , p ij = α j α i + α j . Hence , we can describe a BTL model entirely using the collection of its n skill score parameters { α i : i ∈ [ n ] } . We next describe how a pairwise comparison model char - acterizes the likelihood of a tournament between n agents . To this end , fix any pairwise comparison model { p ij ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) : i , j ∈ [ n ] , i ̸ = j } . For any i ̸ = j , define the outcome of the m th i vs j pairwise comparison between them as the Bernoulli random variable Z m ij ≜ (cid:40) 1 , if j beats i ( with probability p ij ) , 0 , if i beats j ( with probability 1 − p ij ) , ( 3 ) 2023 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory ( ISIT ) 1391 Authorized licensed use limited to the terms of the applicable license agreement with IEEE . Restrictions apply . for m ∈ [ k ij ] , where k ij denotes the number of i vs j com - parisons . We assume throughout that the observation random variables Z ≜ { Z m ij : i , j ∈ [ n ] , i ̸ = j , m ∈ [ k i , j ] } are mutually independent . Let Z ij ≜ (cid:80) k ij m = 1 Z m ij . Clearly , it follows that for any i ̸ = j , Z ij is a binomial random variable , i . e . , Z ij ∼ Bin ( k ij , p ij ) , and for simplicity , we set Z ii = 0 . We also make the following assumption on the pairwise comparison model . Assumption 1 ( Dynamic Range ) : We assume that there is a constant δ ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) such that for all i , j ∈ [ n ] , δ 1 + δ ≤ p ij ≤ 1 1 + δ . ( 4 ) Goal . Given the observations Z of a tournament as defined above , our objective is to determine whether the underlying pairwise comparison model is a BTL model . This corresponds to solving a composite hypothesis testing problem : H 0 : Z ∼ BTL model for some α 1 , . . . , α n > 0 , H 1 : Z ∼ pairwise comparison model that is not BTL , ( 5 ) where the null hypothesis H 0 states that Z is distributed according to a BTL model , and the alternative hypothesis H 1 states that Z is distributed according to a general non - BTL pairwise comparison model . To pose this hypothesis testing problem more rigorously , we demonstrate an interesting relation between a BTL model and its canonical Markov chain . Recall that a Markov chain on the state space [ n ] , defined by the row stochastic matrix W ∈ R n × n , is said to be reversible if it satisfies the detailed balance conditions [ 38 , Section 1 . 6 ] : ∀ i , j ∈ [ n ] , i ̸ = j , π i W ij = π j W ij , ( 6 ) where W ij denotes the probability of transitioning from state i to state j , and π = ( π ( 1 ) , . . . , π ( n ) ) denotes the invariant distribution of the Markov chain ( which always exists ) . Equiv - alently , the Markov chain W is reversible if and only if diag ( π ) W = W T diag ( π ) . ( 7 ) It turns out that there is a tight connection between reversible Markov chains and the BTL model . This is elucidated in the ensuing proposition , cf . [ 39 , Lemma 6 ] , [ 10 ] . Proposition 1 ( BTL Model and Reversibility ) : A pairwise comparison model { p ij ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) : i , j ∈ [ n ] , i ̸ = j } is a BTL model if and only if its canonical Markov chain S ∈ R n × n is reversible and p ij + p ji = 1 for all i , j ∈ [ n ] . Proof : We provide a proof for completeness . If the pairwise comparison model is BTL , it implies that for some weight vector α ∈ R n + , the pairwise comparison matrix P is given by p ij = α j α i + α j for i ̸ = j . It is easy verify that π ≜ (cid:0) (cid:80) ni = 1 α i (cid:1) − 1 [ α 1 · · · α n (cid:3) T is the stationary distribution of canonical Markov chain matrix S corresponding to P . Moreover , S is reversible as π i S ij = α i (cid:80) ni = 1 α i × α j n ( α i + α j ) = π j S ij . For the converse , since p ij > 0 for all i , j ∈ [ n ] , S is irreducible and has a unique stationary distribution π . By reversibility of S , we have for all i ̸ = j , π i S ij = π j S ij = ⇒ π i p ij = π j p ji = ⇒ p ij = π j π i + π j , where last step follows from the fact that p ij + p ji = 1 . Thus , P corresponds to a BTL model with weight vector π . □ Let π be the stationary distribution of the canonical Markov chain matrix S corresponding to a valid pairwise comparison matrix P . By Proposition 1 , any pairwise comparison matrix P is BTL if and only if it satisfies the reversibility condition Π P = P T Π , where Π = diag ( π ) , and translated skew - symmetry P + P T = 1 n 1 T n . It turns out that both conditions are elegantly captured by the matrix Π P + P Π − 1 n π T as illustrated in the Proposition 2 , and we will later use the norm of this matrix to quantify the deviation of a pairwise comparison matrix from being BTL . Proposition 2 ( Orthogonal Decomposition ) : For any pair - wise comparison matrix P ∈ R n × n and vector π ∈ R n with strictly positive entries , we have (cid:13)(cid:13) Π P + P Π − 1 n π T (cid:13)(cid:13) 2 π − 1 , F = (cid:13)(cid:13) Π P − P T Π (cid:13)(cid:13) 2 π − 1 , F + (cid:13)(cid:13) P + P T − 1 n 1 T n (cid:13)(cid:13) 2 π , F , where Π = diag ( π ) . The proof can be found in the extended version of this paper [ 40 ] . It is important to note here that Assumption 1 and the Perron - Frobenius theorem [ 41 , Chapter 8 ] imply that π i > 0 for all i ∈ [ n ] . Hence , the norm ∥ · ∥ π − 1 , F is always well - defined . Hypothesis testing problem . For a given tolerance param - eter ϵ > 0 , we can formulate the hypothesis testing problem in ( 5 ) as : H 0 : Π P + P Π = 1 n π T , H 1 : 1 n ∥ Π P + P Π − 1 n π T ∥ F ≥ ϵ ∥ π ∥ ∞ , ( 8 ) where Π = diag ( π ) and π is the stationary distribution of the canonical Markov chain matrix S corresponding to P . Proposition 3 , which is proved in [ 40 ] , verifies that the null hypothesis indeed captures BTL models . Proposition 3 ( BTL Model Characterization ) : The pairwise comparison matrix P defined in Section II - B corresponds to a BTL model if and only if the hypothesis H 0 in ( 8 ) is true . C . Minimax Risk and Decision Rule Let ϕ denote a hypothesis test ( or decision rule ) that maps the consolidated observations { Z ij , k ij } i , j ∈ [ n ] to { 0 , 1 } , where 0 represents the null hypothesis and 1 represents the alternative hypothesis . Let P H 0 and P H 1 denote the probability distribu - tions of the input variables under H 0 and H 1 , respectively . Let M 0 and M ( ϵ ) denote the sets of matrices P that satisfy the null and alternative hypotheses in ( 8 ) , respectively . Now , define the minimax risk as R m ≜ inf ϕ (cid:40) sup P ∈M 0 P H 0 ( ϕ = 1 ) + sup P ∈M ( ϵ ) P H 1 ( ϕ = 0 ) (cid:41) , ( 9 ) 2023 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory ( ISIT ) 1392 Authorized licensed use limited to the terms of the applicable license agreement with IEEE . Restrictions apply . where the infimum is taken over all { 0 , 1 } - valued tests ϕ . Finally , we can define the critical threshold of the hypothesis testing problem in ( 8 ) as the smallest value of ϵ for which the minimax risk is bounded by 13 : ε c = inf (cid:26) ϵ > 0 : R m ≤ 1 3 (cid:27) . ( 10 ) The constant 13 is arbitrary and can be replaced by any constant in ( 0 , 1 ) . Formally , our objective is to characterize the scaling of the critical radius with respect to n . To this end , we consider a hypothesis test which takes the consolidated observations { Z ij , k ij } i , j ∈ [ n ] as input and evaluates the following expres - sion : T = n (cid:88) i = 1 n (cid:88) j = 1 ( ˆ π i + ˆ π j ) 2 Z ij ( Z ij − 1 ) k ij ( k ij − 1 ) + ˆ π 2 j − 2ˆ π j ( ˆ π i + ˆ π j ) Z ij k ij ( 11 ) where ˆ π denotes the stationary distribution ( choosing one arbitrarily if there are several ) of the empirical Markov chain matrix ˆ S ∈ R n × n defined via ˆ S ij ≜ (cid:40) Z ij k ij n , i ̸ = j , 1 − 1 n (cid:80) u : u ̸ = i Z iu k iu , i = j . ( 12 ) The alternative hypothesis is selected if T > γ / n for some appropriately chosen constant γ independent of n . The test has constructed such that if ˆ π = π then E [ T ] = ∥ Π P + P Π − 1 n π T ∥ 2F , i . e . , we “plug - in " ˆ π in an unbiased estimator of ∥ Π P + P Π − 1 n π T ∥ 2F . III . U PPER B OUND ON C RITICAL T HRESHOLD The ensuing theorem establishes an upper bound on the critical radius of the hypothesis testing problem for the BTL model . For simplicity of analysis , we will assume that k ij = k ji = k for all i , j ∈ [ n ] throughout the sequel . Theorem 1 ( Upper Bound on ε c ) : Consider the hypothesis testing problem in ( 8 ) , and suppose the number of comparisons per pair of agents satisfies k ≥ max (cid:8) 2 , 36 C 2 log ( n ) nδ 4 (cid:9) for some constant C > 0 . Then , there exists another constant c > 0 such that for any ϵ > 0 with ϵ 2 ≥ c n , we have R m ≤ 13 . Hence , we obtain the bound ε 2 c ≤ c n . The proof is provided in [ 40 ] . IV . L OWER B OUND ON C RITICAL T HRESHOLD We now prove an information theoretic lower bound on the critical radius for the BTL hypothesis testing problem , thus proving the minimax optimality of the scaling provided in the upper bound ( up to constant factors ) . Theorem 2 ( Lower Bound on ε c ) : Consider the hypothesis testing problem in ( 8 ) . Then , there exists a constant c > 0 such that the critical radius ε c is lower bounded as ε 2 c ≥ c kn . Proof : We will use the Ingster - Suslina method for construct - ing a lower bound on the critical radius [ 42 ] . The method is similar to the well - known Le Cam’s method , but it establishes a minimax lower bound by considering a point and a mixture on the parameter space instead of just two points . ( Although Le Cam’s method could also be used for this proof in principle , the Ingster - Suslina method greatly simplifies the calculations to bound total variation distance in our setting . ) Under the null hypothesis , we assume that the pairwise comparison matrix P is fixed to be an all 1 / 2 matrix , i . e . , H 0 : P = P 0 ≜ 1 2 1 n 1 T n . ( 13 ) We will denote the distribution corresponding to the pairwise comparison matrix P 0 by P 0 . Moreover , note that under H 0 , the stationary distribution of the canonical Markov chain matrix S is uniform , i . e . , π = 1 n 1 n . Under the alternative hypothesis , we assume that the pairwise comparison matrix P θ is generated by sampling the parameter θ uniformly from the set Θ , i . e . , H 1 : P = P θ and θ ∼ Unif ( Θ ) , ( 14 ) and for some θ ∈ Θ , P θ is given by P θ = (cid:34) 12 1 n / 2 1 T n / 2 12 1 n / 2 1 T n / 2 + ηQ θ 12 1 n / 2 1 T n / 2 − ηQ θ 12 1 n / 2 1 T n / 2 (cid:35) , ( 15 ) where Θ is set of all permuation matrices , and Q θ is the n / 2 × n / 2 permutation matrix corresponding to the permutation θ . Let P Θ denote the distribution corresponding to the pairwise comparison matrix P θ . The construction of this mixture was inspired by [ 36 ] . However , there are two notable differences . Firstly , the problem in [ 36 ] is distinguishing whether two sets of data samples consisting of pairwise comparisons are coming from the same underlying distribution or two different distributions described by a pairwise comparison model . In contrast , our work tests whether or not a single dataset is sampled from a BTL model . Secondly , the manner in which a notion of distance is used to define the deviation of the given data from the null hypothesis is very different in the two works . Let S θ denote the canonical Markov chain matrix cor - responding to P θ . It is straightforward to verify that the stationary distribution of S θ is independent of the permutation θ . Let π denote the stationary distribution of S θ . By the symmetry of S θ , the set of first n / 2 elements , and respectively , last n / 2 elements , of π are equal , i . e . , π 1 = · · · = π n / 2 ≜ x and π ( n / 2 ) + 1 = · · · = π n ≜ y . Now x and y can be determined by solving the set of linear equations : π T = π T S θ and n (cid:88) i = 1 π i = 1 . Solving these equations gives x = 1 n (cid:18) 1 − 4 η n (cid:19) and y = 1 n (cid:18) 1 + 4 η n (cid:19) . 2023 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory ( ISIT ) 1393 Authorized licensed use limited to the terms of the applicable license agreement with IEEE . Restrictions apply . It is also easy to verify that the deviation from BTL ∥ Π P θ + P θ Π − 1 n π T ∥ F is independent of the permutation θ and is given by ∥ Π P θ + P T θ Π − 1 n π T ∥ 2F = n 2 (cid:18) ( x + y ) (cid:18) 1 2 + η (cid:19) − y (cid:19) 2 + n 2 (cid:18) ( x + y ) (cid:18) 1 2 − η (cid:19) − x (cid:19) 2 + n 2 (cid:16) n 2 − 1 (cid:17)(cid:18) x + y 2 − y (cid:19) 2 + n 2 (cid:16) n 2 − 1 (cid:17)(cid:18) x + y 2 − x (cid:19) 2 = 2 η 2 n (cid:18) 1 − 2 n (cid:19) 2 + 2 η 2 n 2 (cid:18) 1 − 2 n (cid:19) . ( 16 ) Let ϵ = ∥ Π P θ + P θ Π − 1 n π T ∥ F / ( n ∥ π ∥ ∞ ) to ensure that P θ ’s satisfy the condition of the alternative hypothesis in ( 8 ) . Substituting the values of ∥ π ∥ ∞ = y and ∥ Π P θ + P T θ Π − 1 n π T ∥ F implies that ϵ ≤ Cη / √ n for some constant C > 0 . Now , the Ingster - Suslina method [ 42 ] states that R m ≥ 1 2 (cid:16) 1 − (cid:112) χ 2 ( P 0 | | P Θ ) (cid:17) , where χ 2 ( · | | · ) denotes the χ 2 - divergence . Similar to the anal - ysis in [ 36 , Theorem 3 ] , for the distributions P 0 and P Θ , if we have η 2 ≤ ck for some constant c independent of n , k , then we can upper bound the χ 2 ( P 0 | | P Θ ) term as χ 2 ( P 0 | | P Θ ) ≤ 19 . Hence , we have shown that there exists a constant c > 0 , such that if nϵ 2 ≤ c / k , then χ 2 ( P 0 | | P Θ ) ≤ 19 , which implies that the minimax risk R m ≥ 13 . Hence , ε 2 c ≥ c / ( kn ) as desired . □ We defer readers to [ 40 ] for a more detailed proof . V . S TABILITY OF THE BTL A SSUMPTION In this section , we analyze the stability of the BTL as - sumption in the context of rankings . The BTL ranking orders agents based on the stationary distribution π of the canonical Markov - chain matrix . Meanwhile , the Borda count ranking is more general , as it doesn’t rely on the BTL assumption , and instead is based on Borda scores [ 27 ] ( defined below ) . If the BTL assumption holds , then Borda ranking equals the BTL ranking . Our goal is to determine the size of the deviation from the BTL condition in a pairwise comparison model that is sufficient to produce a discrepancy between the BTL and Borda count rankings . For this section , we will consider the symmetric setting in which the pairwise comparison matrix P satisfies , p ij + p ji = 1 . Define the Borda count τ i ( P ) of an agent i ∈ [ n ] as the ( scaled ) probability that i beats any other agent selected uniformly at random [ 27 ] : τ i ( P ) ≜ n (cid:88) j = 1 ( 1 − p ij ) . ( 17 ) Now we show that the stability of the BTL assumption decreases as n grows meaning that even smaller deviations from the BTL condition can lead to a reversed ranking . Proposition 4 ( Stability of BTL Assumption ) : There exists a pairwise comparison matrices P ∈ R n × n such that two rows i , j ∈ [ n ] having constant ∆ τ ≜ τ i ( P ) − τ j ( P ) > 0 , but has an 32 40 48 56 64 72 80 88 96 104 112 120 128 Number of Teams n 0 . 32 0 . 3070 . 2930 . 28 0 . 2670 . 2530 . 24 0 . 2270 . 2130 . 2 0 . 1870 . 1730 . 16 P e r t uba t i on 1 2 3 4 5 10 - 3 Fig . 1 .

Moreover , the deviation of P from BTL condition decays as (cid:13)(cid:13) Π P + P Π − 1 n π T (cid:13)(cid:13) F ≤ c √ n for some constant c > 0 . The proof is provided in [ 40 ] . Proposition 4 highlights that the BTL assumption may potentially give a wrong ranking when the underlying pairwise matrix is O ( 1 / √ n ) “distance” away from the BTL condition . Interestingly , this O ( 1 / √ n ) deviation coincides with the critical threshold for the BTL testing problem ( up to constant factors ) . It would be interesting to further explore the stability of the BTL assumption in the context of rankings . VI . N UMERICAL S IMULATIONS In this section , we will empirically analyze the behavior of the minimax risk and the deviation ∥ Π P + P Π − 1 π T ∥ F via a synthetic experiment . We will use the same construction for the pairwise comparison matrix P that we utilized in ( 2 ) under the null and alternate hypothesis which are presented in ( 13 ) and ( 14 ) . We set the number of pairwise comparisons per pair of agents k = 12 , the number of agents n is linearly increased from 32 to 128 , and the perturbation η in ( 15 ) is increased from 0 . 16 to 0 . 32 . Simulations are performed for each value of η and n , and the corresponding value of expected values of test T under hypothesis H 1 and minimax risk R m is estimated . The threshold used for the decision rule is set to η 2 / n . Fig . 2 plots the empirical average of T under H 1 and 1 R m > 4 / 5 for different values of η and n . Note that the behavior of empirical average of T ( under H 1 ) is consistent with ( 16 ) and moreover for a fixed value of η the behavior of R m is independent of n . VII . C ONCLUSION In this work , we studied the problem of testing whether a BTL model accurately represents the data generated from an underlying pairwise comparison model . We developed a rig - orous hypothesis test ( 8 ) for this purpose and established that the ( miminax ) critical threshold for this test is ε c = Θ ( 1 / √ n ) . We also took the first steps towards rigorously characterizing the stability of the BTL assumption for rankings . Our results indicated that the BTL assumption may lead to different rankings if the pairwise comparison matrix deviates from the BTL condition by O ( 1 / √ n ) . 2023 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory ( ISIT ) 1394 Authorized licensed use limited to the terms of the applicable license agreement with IEEE .
