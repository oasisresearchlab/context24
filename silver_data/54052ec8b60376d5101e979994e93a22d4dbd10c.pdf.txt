Luigi de Luca a mia figlia e mia moglie , a mio padre , mia madre e mia sorella , ai miei nonni Respirare l’aria , parlare , passeggiare , essere questo incredibile Dio che io sono ! Oh meraviglia delle cose , anche delle più piccole particelle ! Oh spiritualità delle cose ! Io canto il sole all’alba e nel meriggio , o come ora nel tramonto : tremo , commosso , della saggezza e della bellezza della terra e di tutte le cose che crescono sulla terra . E credo che una foglia d’erba non sia meno di un giorno di lavoro delle stelle e dico che la Natura è eterna , la gloria è eterna . Lodo con voce inebriata perché non vedo un’imperfezione nell’universo , non vedo una causa o un risultato che , alla fine , sia male . E alla domanda che ricorre : Che cosa c’è di buono in tutto questo ? La risposta è : che tu sei qui , che esiste la vita , che tu sei vivo , che il potente spettacolo continua , e tu puoi contribuire con un tuo verso !

XI Abstract The main aim of the work is the objective and subjective evaluation of two aspects of the interaction user - product , the seating discomfort and the user interface usability , relevant to industrial design , by using innovative methodologies for generating interpretative and predictive models that allowed the development of analysis strategies useful to improve the satisfaction of use of the types of industrial products considered . On the first aspect investigated , research in the field of medicine and epidemiology has shown that , over the past decades , the incidence of work - related musculoskeletal disorders ( WMSDs ) has considerably increased due to sedentary modern lifestyle , closely related to prolonged period of sitting . The importance of good office seating design in improving human wellness , greatly motivates the interest of specialized literature in topics related to the investigation of the biomechanical aspects of sitting and their effect on perceived discomfort . Typically discomfort assessment is realized on the basis of subjective evaluations and / or postural analysis by the interface pressures . In such context , the experimental sessions and the related data analysis were aimed to investigating on three critical aspects of seat discomfort assessment : 1 ) the relationship between subjective and objective measures of seat discomfort ; 2 ) gender - based differences in seat interface pressure distribution ; 3 ) discriminant effectiveness of indexes based on seat interface pressure . On the second aspect investigated , it’s helpful to recognize that , today , design team can speed up the process of managing information related to design process by adopting digital pattern tools . These tools , as Knowledge Based Engineering ( KBE ) systems , can assist engineers in capture and re - use the multidisciplinary knowledge in an integrated way , in order to reduce time and cost of designing , to automate repetitive tasks and to support activities in conceptual design . The KBE analyzed in this study is a new digital pattern tool that supports the designers of automotive gearboxes . In such context , the research has focused on the evaluation of interface usability that represents a critical point in the development of a KBE system to demonstrate an effective reduction in the time and cost of designing and increased satisfaction in its use . XII The methods used for the two aspects studied are both theoretical and experimental and can be summarized in four main steps : 1 ) development of participative protocols and execution of experimental sessions with collecting of objective measures related to the interaction user - product and subjective measures related to user perceptions ; 2 ) organization , classification and synthesis of experimental data collected by using techniques of descriptive statistics ; 3 ) definition of interpretative and predictive models of phenomena investigated including by developing synthetic indexes , by using techniques of multivariate and multicriteria analysis ; 4 ) statistical validation of these models and indexes . The main results achieved concern the assessment of user - product interaction for different types of industrial products where such evaluation is essential . The outcomes are originals because they allowed to find the factors that had most influence on case studies and to develop synthetic indexes useful for identify some critical issues related use . Statistical data analysis provided new information relating to phenomena examined . Furthermore , the proposed data analysis strategies can be easily adapted to other experimental contexts , involving different target populations , and could have important effects in the industrial field , because they allow the reduction of design time ( with obvious consequences on cost ) and improvement of products in terms of end - user satisfaction .

Preface 1 . 1 Organization of the thesis This work is divided into two basic lines of research . In section 2 an insight into seating discomfort via a comprehensive statistical data analysis and new diagnostic tools is presented . In Section 3 a new methodological approach is discussed , in order to improve the usability of a new digital pattern tool graphical user interface . 1 . 2 Appended papers The two research lines have been the starting point for the development of several papers , appended at the end of the thesis . In particular , Paper A and C are the results of the first chronologically contributions to research and have allowed the successive discussions in the user experience context ( Paper B and D ) ; whereas the paper E , F , and G are not directly on the research lines mentioned , but have enhanced the experience developing of experimental protocols and using statistical and optimization methods as Robust Design ( RD ) , Design of Experiment ( DoE ) and Operations Research ( OR ) . These tools are useful in product innovation . A short summary of each paper is following given . 1 . 3 Paper A : Seat design improvement via comfort indexes based on interface pressure data Lanzotti A . , Vanacore A . , Del Giudice D . M . , Proceedings of Joint Conference on Mechanical , Design Engineering & Advanced Manufacturing 2014 , Paper n . 72 , Toulouse ( France ) , June 18 th – 20 th 2014 , 7 pp . It’s waiting to be published on Research in Interactive Design Vol . 4 book by Springer Verlag ( ISBN available soon ) . Literature on seat comfort recognizes that seat interface pressures are the objective comfort measures that most clearly relate to users’ comfort perceptions about sitting experience . In this paper , the above relationship is quantitatively investigated by performing simple but effective explorative analyses on seat comfort data collected during experimental sessions involving 22 volunteers who tested 4 office chairs ( differing in terms - 20 - of cushion stiffness ) . Statistical data analyses show that subjective sitting comfort / discomfort ratings are significantly related to several combinations of pressure variables . The joint analysis of synthetic indexes based on seat interface pressures reveals to be a useful tool for comparative seat comfort assessment . Besides valuable suggestions for the definition of an effective strategy for seat comfort assessment , the results of data analyses provide useful information to support the product design phase . In fact , the sitting experience results to be significantly improved by : ( 1 ) a balancing of pressures between the bilateral buttocks ; and ( 2 ) a balancing of contact areas between buttocks and thighs . 1 . 4 Paper B : Getting insight into Seating Discomfort via a comprehensive statistical data analysis and new diagnostic tools Lanzotti A . , Vanacore A . , Del Giudice D . M . , on the 24 th of March in 2015 it was submitted to Applied Ergonomics , ISSN 18729126 and 00036870 ( Q1 nel 2013 ) , 12 pp . This paper provides new insights in the evaluation of seating discomfort with respect to three major concerns : 1 ) the relationship between subjective and objective measures of seat discomfort ; 2 ) the gender - based differences in the distribution of seat - interface pressure ; 3 ) the discriminant effectiveness of indexes based on seat - interface pressure . Seating discomfort data ( both subjective and objective measures ) were collected performing a designed experiment involving 22 volunteers who tested 4 office chairs ( differing in terms of cushion stiffness ) . Statistical data analyses showed that subjective sitting discomfort ratings were significantly related to several combinations of pressure variables . This result , together with the evidence of gender - based differences in the distribution of seat - interface pressure , pushes forward a better exploitation of all information available in a pressure map . For this purpose , two novel methods for both graphical ( Maximum Peak Contact Pressure - MPCP map ) and analytical ( Weighted Pressure Comfort Loss - WPCL index ) analysis of seat - interface pressure data are discussed . Their joint use can provide useful information to support the product design phase being effective for comparative seat discomfort assessment . Though the paper focus is on the comparative assessment of office seating discomfort across a gender stratified population of healthy users , the proposed data analysis strategy can be easily adapted to other experimental seating contexts involving different target populations . - 21 - 1 . 5 Paper C : GUI usability improvement for a new digital pattern tool to assist gearbox design Patalano S . , Del Giudice D .

One of the best presented papers proposed to be published in the International Journal of Interactive Design and Manufacture ( indexed in Scopus , Q1 in 2013 ; ISSN 1952513 and 19552505 ) . Design team can speed up the process of managing information related to gearbox design process by adopting digital pattern tools . These tools , as KBE systems , can assist engineers in re - using previous knowledge in order to improve time - consuming task as retrieval and selection of previous architectures and to modify and virtually test a new gearbox design . A critical point in the development of a KBE system is the interface usability to demonstrate effective reduction of development time and satisfaction in its use . In this paper , the authors face the problem of usability improvement of the Graphical User Interface ( GUI ) of the KBE system previously proposed . An approach based on Analytic Hierarchy Process ( AHP ) and Multiple - Criteria Decision Analysis ( MCDA ) has been used . A participatory test has been performed for evaluating the Usability Index ( UI ) of the GUI . Taking into account the data analysis some changes have been carried out and a new GUI release has been validated with new experimentations . 1 . 6 Paper D : On the usability assessment of a new digital pattern tool graphical user interface Patalano S . , Del Giudice D . M . , Gerbino S . , Lanzotti A . , Vitolo F . , to be submitted to International Journal of Interactive Design and Manufacture , ISSN 1952513 e 19552505 ( Q1 nel 2013 ) , 15 pp . Design team spend up to 30 % of their time to searching data and this percentage rises up to 50 % if you take into account the time spent to their validating . To speed up these design processes , the use of a knowledge - based engineering ( KBE ) system is recommended . A critical point in the development of a KBE system is the interface usability for - 22 - demonstrating an effective reduction of development time and satisfaction in its use . This work tackles the usability improvement of the KBE system’s Graphical User Interface ( GUI ) which assists designing of automotive manual transverse gearboxes , through participatory tests . It’s worthwhile to note that this work is an extended version of paper B . In particular , the paper is focused on a new validation experiment for highlighting how important it’s use an iterative design when tests on usability assessment are performed . Results have demonstrated an significant improvement . 1 . 7 Paper E : Computational Procedure for Location Sensor Network Monitoring Volcanic Ash Malmo F . , Del Giudice D . M . , Sterle C . , Proceedings of XIII International Symposium On Locational DEcision 2014 ( ISOLDE ) , Naples / Capri ( Italy ) , June 16 th – 20 th 2014 , ISBN 9788898273072 , abstract . ISOLDE is a triennial Symposium in conjunction with the XXI Meeting of EURO Working Group on Locational Analysis ( EWGLA ) . Global air traffic is significantly affected by the volcanic ash especially when unfavourable weather conditions occur . About 500 active volcanoes are in the world and the plume thrown up by the eruptions provoked several crisis . Therefore , managing the problem of volcanic ash is a new important challenge for civil aviation , which if neglected can cause significant damage to aircrafts and large economic loss . In order to define no - flight levels , to re - route scheduled flights and to give warning massages to planes already on flight , we propose to use a permanent monitoring system . The aim is to place the sensors of monitoring system optimizing an objective function which is a linear combination of cost and performance , guaranteeing the required safety level . In this paper we tackle this problem by the usage of covering optimization models . The proposed model has been optimally solved by the usage of Xpress optimization software and tested on real test cases using the northern Italy . - 23 - 1 . 8 Paper F : On the Influence of Scanning Parameters on the Laser Scanner based 3D Inspection Process Gerbino S . , Del Giudice D . M . , Staiano G . , Martorelli M . , Lanzotti A , on the 21 th of January in 2015 it was submitted to International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology , ISSN 14333015 and 02683768 ( Q1 , IF 1 . 78 in 2013 ) , 19 pp . The quality of 3D scanned data is influenced by many factors both related to internal elements to the acquisition device , such as scanner resolution and accuracy , and external to it , such as proper selection of scanning parameters , ambient illumination and characteristics of the object surface being scanned ( e . g . surface colour , glossiness , roughness , shape ) . Today it is of great industrial interest to study and correctly setting the scanning parameters that allow to improve the quality of the 3D acquisitions so to increase the massive usage of these systems in the product inspection activities . In this paper the effects of some scanning parameters and the ambient illumination were analysed by using a commercial triangulation 3D laser scanner . The test geometry chosen was a commercial sheet metal part more complex than the ones commonly used in laboratory and documented in literature . The outcomes of tests confirmed some suggestions documented in literature but also pointed out that the most influencing factor is the relative orientation of the object with respect to the scanner , as well as , its position of the measurement device within the field of view . 1 . 9 Paper G : On the Geometric Accuracy of RepRap Open - Source 3D Printer Lanzotti A . , Del Giudice D . M . , Staiano G . , Martorelli M . , On the Geometric Accuracy of RepRap Open - Source 3D Printer , on 15 th of February in 2015 it was submitted to Journal of Mechanical Design – Transactions of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers ( ASME ) , ISSN 10500472 ( Q1 , IF 1 . 17 in 2013 ) , 13 pp . In the field of Additive Manufacturing ( AM ) processes , there is a significant lack of scientific data on the performance of open - source 3D printers in relation to process parameter values . The purpose of this paper is to assess the impact of the main process parameters on the accuracy of a set of typical geometrical features , as obtained with an - 24 - open - source 3D printer , the RepRap Prusa - Mendel I2 . A benchmarking part was set up , composed of elementary shapes , representing a series of different features . By means of a DoE approach , we were able to assess the effect of two process parameters - layer thickness and flow rate – on five geometrical features : cube , sphere , cylinder , cone and angled surfaces . A high resolution Laser Scanner was used to evaluate the variation between real features and nominal geometry . On the basis of the experimental results , it was possible to analyze and discuss the main effects of the process parameters on each feature . These results can help RepRap users in the correct selection of the process parameters with the aim of improving the quality of prototypes . - 25 - 2 . Seating Discomfort Assessment via comprehensive Statistical Analysis and New Diagnostic Tools 2 . 1 A brief literature review People use products related to comfort everyday , like clothes , tools , electric appliances , computers and their workstations at the office and home , as well as , seats at the office and in airplanes , trains , bus and cars . You think , for instance , to how many hours students spend sitting from primary school to university , as well as , the office workers in their working lives . So , if you watch at the trends such as “attention to well - being” , “attention to health” , “graying of the workforce ( and population ) ” and “environmental awareness” , you realize that comfort and discomfort are closely related to these issues as well . It’s clear that the knowledge on comfort and discomfort are critical , but at the present this knowledge is still at the early stage . Recognized by specialized literature the definitions of comfort and discomfort are : “comfort is seen as pleasant state or relaxed feeling of a human being in reaction to its environment” and “discomfort is seen as an unpleasant state of the human body in reaction to its physical environment” ( Vink , 2012 ) . The theories of comfort and discomfort have been investigated by Helander and Zhang ( 1997 ) , de Looze et al . ( 2003 ) , Kuijt - Evers et al . ( 2004 ) , Moes ( 2005 ) and Vink ( 2012 ) . These authors have provided models and frameworks that convince experts . In particular , Helander and Zhang have provided a division between comfort and discomfort scales , de Looze et al . have added the physical dimension to the discomfort definition , Moes has theorized a simple and linear model of discomfort process and Vink has proposed a new synthesis model based on those previous . 2 . 1 . 1 On comfort and discomfort division by Helander and Zhang ( 1997 ) Helander and Zhang ( 1997 ) distinguished comfort and discomfort . According to their theory , the absence of discomfort does not automatically result in comfort . Comfort will be felt when more is experienced than expected . Based on questionnaires ( Zhang et al . , 1996 ; Helander and Zhang , 1997 ) discomfort is related to physical characteristics of the environment , whereas comfort is related to luxury , relaxation or well - being ( Table 2 . 1 ) . - 26 - This division is confirmed by the fact that comfort scales did not seem useful for high physical load ( > 65 % MVC ) .

( 2012 ) focusing on comfortable VDU or computer work , have found that the use of different sensory channels can influence the comfort experience . So , you need to be aware of this fact . Furthermore , Vink et al . ( 2012 ) investigating on airplane passengers’ comfort have highlighted that psychosocial factors like personal attention influence comfort . - Activities influence comfort : Ellegast et al . ( 2012 ) and Groenesteijn et al . ( 2012 ) compared five office chairs during the execution of office tasks both in the office and in the laboratory . They proved how important it is search for the correct context and specific activity when experiments on comfort or discomfort are performed . - Different body regions : Franz et al . ( 2012 ) tested various foam characteristics to define the most comfortable headrest . They described that the head needed different foam firmness than the neck . In addition , Kong et al . ( 2012 ) found that comfort in the palm in of the hand has been more related to the force levels than at the fingers . So , these results demonstrate that the product design is more complex , because the material characteristics need to be different for various locations having contact with the human body . - 27 - - Contour : Measuring the emotional reaction to a tactile experience in seating , the study by Kamp ( 2012 ) proved that contour and sporty or luxurious feel and appreciation influences comfort . Furthermore , Noro et al . ( 2012 ) found effects of contour affecting comfort for long - term static sitting . In particular , they have demonstrated , through a new surgeons seat inspired by that of the Zen priests , the importance of following the form of the human body in product design for comfort . - Physical loading : In research or evaluation of products in development , the use of comfort and discomfort scales are useful to estimate the physical loading ( Kee and Lee , 2012 ) , especially above 65 % MVC discomfort scales are more useful ( Kong et al . , 2012 ) . In general , long testing periods may be useful when rating comfort or discomfort for lower forces ( Kyung and Nussbaum , 2008 ; Zenk et al . , 2012 ) . 2 . 1 . 3 The model by de Looze ( 2003 ) According to the division on comfort and discomfort , de Looze et al . ( 2003 ) proposed a model which highlights the relationship between the product physical features and comfort and / or discomfort experience . Figure 2 . 1 ( on the next page ) shows the above model and how new specific knowledge ( see section 2 . 1 . 2 ) are connected to it . The left side of this theoretical model concerns discomfort . The physical processes that underlie discomfort incorporate model parameters on the etiology of WMSDs ( Winkel and Westgaard , 1992 ; Armstrong et al . , 1993 ) , which consider the exposure , the dose , the response and the capacity . The exposure refers to the external factors producing a disturbance of the internal state ( dose ) of a person . The degree to which external exposure leads to an internal dose and the response depends on the physical capacity of the person . The right side of the model regards the comfort only . The influential factors are described on human , product and context levels . At the human level , the individual expectations and other individual feelings or emotions are supposed that influence comfort . At the product level , the product aesthetic design as well as its physical features may affect the feelings of comfort . At the context level , the psychosocial factors together with the physical features play a role on comfort . - 28 - Figure 2 . 1 : How to the new knowledge has been linked to the model of de Looze ( 2003 ) . 2 . 1 . 4 The model by Moes ( 2005 ) Also , the model of Moes ( 2005 ) could be used for explaining the process of discomfort experience . According to this model , there are five phases in the process before discomfort is experienced ( I – interaction , E – effect in the internal body , P – perceived effects , A – appreciation of the effects and D – discomfort ; Figure 2 . 2 ) . Figure 2 . 2 : The process of discomfort experience by Moes . This process is dependent on the person , the seat , the purpose and why the seat is used . The interaction ( I ) arises when a person uses a seat with a specific purpose . If we consider - 29 - the seat - interface pressure , there is an interaction that results in internal body effects ( E ) , such as tissue deformation or the compression of nerves and blood vessels . These effects can be perceived ( P ) and interpreted , such as pain . The following phase is the appreciation ( A ) of the perception . So , if these factors are not appreciated , it can lead to feelings of discomfort ( D ) . 2 . 1 . 5 Pros and cons of the models The model by de Looze reflects the prevailing concept of two distinct scales , one for discomfort and one for comfort ( not just lack of discomfort ) , as shown by Kong et al . ( 2012 ) . Often “more comfort than expected” is reflected in a comfort experience , which is a valuable result of the de Looze model . The model of Moes ( 2005 ) is simple and linear and explains the process more clearly as the step between interaction and internal effects and weighting the internal to check whether it is appreciated are explicitly shown ( Franz et al . , 2012 ; Kamp , 2012 ) . The advantages of the model of de Looze et al . are that : - the environment is explicitly shown ( as in Noro et al . , 2012 ; Ellegast et al . , 2012 ) ; - the connection to expectations can be made , which is important in the mental process of deciding whether or not a product is comfortable ( as in Vink et al . , 2012 ) ; - the “comfort” can be an outcome . Both models point out the probability of a relationship between discomfort and musculoskeletal complaints , but Hamberg - van Reenen et al . ( 2008 ) confirms that discomfort may influence the chance of having musculoskeletal disorders in the long - term . 2 . 1 . 6 A new comfort model by Vink Vink presented a new comfort model ( see Figure 2 . 3 on the next page ) inspired by the model of Moes ( 2005 ) and de Looze ( 2003 ) . The interaction ( I ) between a product and a person starts in an environment where the person is doing a specific task . This may cause in internal human body effects ( H ) , such as changes in the human sensors , postural changes , tactile sensations , muscular activation and blood flow changes . The human body effects ( H ) as well as the expectations ( E ) influence the perceived effects ( P ) . These are interpreted as comfortable ( C ) or you feel nothing ( N ) or it can lead to feelings of - 30 - discomfort ( D ) . Discomfort could lead in musculoskeletal complaints ( M ) . The expectations ( E ) are often linked to comfort ( C ) as shown by the circle around E - C . If discomfort is too high or the comfort not good enough there is a feedback loop to the person who could do something like shifting in the seat , adapt the product or to change the task / usage . Also , the author supposes that both comfort and discomfort could be simultaneous experiences that occur not in one form . Figure 2 . 3 : The model of Vink ( 2012 ) heavily inspired by the models of Moes and de Looze . 2 . 1 . 7 Critical remarks and future challenges Every year an incredible amount of products are designed and put on the market , but these are rarely tested and iteratively refined / redesigned for comfort . Thanks to the work of Vink ( 2012 ) based on the previous models ( see Moes , 2005 ; de Looze et al . , 2003 ) new scientific knowledge became available and a further step towards the conceptualization of comfort and discomfort has been taken . It’s clear that you should define first the tasks and the characteristics of users performing such tasks and only then should you proceed with product design and required tests . But , with the knowledge that the outcomes of tests should be fed back into the iterative design process . Additionally , data on the internal human body effects are essential to understand the process towards experiencing comfort or discomfort . As environmental and sustainability issues become more important , you need to design products that consume less energy . “For this reason it is important to know what the minimum requirements are for user feelings of comfort and what makes a product comfortable ” ( Vink , 2012 ) . - 31 - 2 . 2 Introduction Research in the field of medicine and epidemiology has shown that , over the past decades , the incidence of work - related musculoskeletal disorders ( WMSDs ) has considerably increased ( Harkness et al . , 2005 ; Rubin , 2007 ) due to sedentary modern lifestyle characterized by prolonged period of time spent in a seated position ( Ehrlich , 2003 ; Dul and Hilderbrandt , 1987 ; Annetts et al . , 2012 ) . More than 60 % of people experience at least one episode of lower back pain ( LBP ) at work , in almost 45 % of cases the first attack of LBP happens while working , with an incidence in the office workers of at least one episode backache every 3 years ( Lengsfeld et al . , 2000 ; Rezaee et al . , 2011 ) . Sitting on an ergonomic chair with a correct posture is undoubtedly one of the most useful remedy in preventing WMSDs , ( Nelson and Silverstein , 1998 ; Herbert et al . , 2001 ; Loisel et al . , 2001 ) . The importance of good office seating design in improving human wellness greatly motivates the interest of specialized literature in topics related to the investigation of the biomechanical aspects of sitting and their effect on perceived ( dis ) comfort . Typically , discomfort is associated to “an unpleasant state of the human body in reaction to its physical environment” ( Vink , 2012 ) and its assessment is realized on the basis of subjective evaluations and / or postural analysis . Subjective evaluations are collected by surveying potential seat users who are asked to express their feelings of discomfort with the seat and / or compare , in terms of perceived discomfort , similar seats . Postural analysis is realized by measuring one or more objective parameters , several of which are listed in ( Andreoni et al . , 2002 ) : - the pattern of muscle activation measured through electromyography ( EMG ) ( Lueder , 1986 ; van Dieën et al . , 2001 ) ; - the stress acting on the spine measured through pressure transducer and radio waves ( Lueder , 1986 ; Zenk et al . , 2012 ) ; - the postural angles obtained using contact or non - contact ( like photogrammetric ) techniques in real experiments ( Dreyfuss , 2002 ) or using virtual manikins in virtual experiments ( Lanzotti , 2008 ; Barone and Lanzotti , 2009 ) ; - the seat - interface pressure measured through capacitative or resistive mats ( Kyung and Nussbaum , 2008 ) . - 32 - Many researchers have tried to deepen the relationship between such measurements ( Zhang et al . , 1996 ) . Among all objective parameters , pressure distribution results the objective measure with the clearest correlation with subjective evaluation ( de Looze et al . , 2003 ; Hamberg - van Reenen et al . , 2008 ; Kyung and Nussbaum , 2008 ; Stinson and Crawford , 2009 ; Noro et al . , 2012 ) . In particular , in several studies on seating design ( Kamijo et al . , 1982 ; Reed and Grant , 1993 ; Park et al . , 2000 ; Fujimaki and Mitsuya , 2002 ; Franz et al . , 2012 ) , the effects on seat ( dis ) comfort due to specific product features ( e . g . cushion shape and materials ) have been qualitatively verified by correlating the information obtained from pressure maps with users’ ( dis ) comfort perceptions . In their recent review on the effectiveness of pressure measurements in the assessment of office chair comfort / discomfort , Zemp et al . ( 2015 ) highlight that investigations on the pressure - comfort / discomfort relationship are mainly based on seats other than the office one ( e . g . car seats , wheelchairs , tractor seat and surgery seat ) ; they call for further investigations in order to definitively answer whether pressure measurements are suitable for assessing the comfort / discomfort experienced while sitting in office investigating empirical chairs . Independently from the specific investigation context , a further concern in studies on sitting comfort / discomfort assessment is that pressure measurements are not fully exploited being pressure distribution mostly described by the maximum ( peak ) pressure and / or the average pressure . Hitherto , little effort has been made to properly synthesize all the information provided by a pressure map and to highlight the usefulness of seat - interface pressure measures for specific purposes defined by designers ( e . g . design for a specific user or design for a generic user ) . In this work the main results of an experiment aimed at deepening knowledge on office seat discomfort are described . In particular the experiment and the related explorative data analysis were aimed at investigating three critical aspects of seat discomfort assessment : 1 ) the relationship between subjective and objective measures of seat discomfort ; 2 ) the gender - based differences in the distribution of seat - interface pressure ; 3 ) the discriminant effectiveness of indexes based on seat - interface pressure . The dependency of subjective discomfort ratings from contact area and pressure variables was explored via ( a ) Principal Component Regression ( PCR ) and ( b ) Partial Least Squares Regression ( PLSR ) ; gender - based differences in seat - interface pressure distribution were investigated by analysing the sampling distributions of the unloaded weight for male and female users and building new pressure maps of the Maximum Peak Contact Pressure - 33 - ( MPCP ) ; finally , the discriminant effectiveness in predicting seat discomfort was evaluated for two indexes based on seat - interface pressure : the Peak of Contact Pressure ( PCP ) and the Weighted Pressure Comfort Loss ( WPCL ; Lanzotti et al . , 2011 ) . 2 . 3 Materials and Methods Data were obtained from an experiment performed at the Department of Industrial Engineering , University of Naples Federico II , in a suitable room cleared of furnishings and according to a well - defined experimental protocol . The whole experiment consisted of 88 experimental sessions during which 22 volunteers tested four ergonomic office chairs performing a task of reading a text on a Visual Display Unit ( VDU ) . 2 . 3 . 1 Seat Conditions The four office seats have a typical architecture of market product ( i . e . a five - pointed base , a backrest and two armrests ) , but differ for the stiffness of the seat pan foam . The seats were named with fantasy names ( Oslo Chair , OC , Madrid Chair , MC , Chicago Chair , CC , and Toronto Chair , TC ) so as to avoid any conditioning of the brand name or the model name on the evaluation ( Table 2 . 2 ) . The codes 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 used to distinguish different Seat Conditions refer to increasing levels of cushion stiffness with extremes low ( i . e . soft cushion ) and high ( i . e . rigid cushion ) . Table 2 . 2 : The tested seat conditions . Office Seat OC MC CC TC Seat Condition ( Stiffness ) 0 ( Low ) 1 2 3 ( High ) 2 . 3 . 2 Subjective and objective measures of seat discomfort During each experimental session subjective measures of discomfort perception as well as seat - interface pressures were collected . In order to collect users’ evaluations about seat discomfort , three different scales were used : 1 ) the Discomfort Rating ( DR ) based on a 10 - points ordinal scale with extremes 1 ( no discomfort ) and 10 ( maximum discomfort ) ; 2 ) the Discomfort Degree ( DD ) based on a 4 - level scale of agreement with the statement “I feel uncomfortable” ; 3 ) the Chair Ranking - 34 - ( CR ) based on ordinal ascending ranks assigned to chairs consistently with the level of perceived discomfort . Objective measures were obtained from pressure measured at the seat - interface ; these measures consisted of both overall and local pressures ( Table 2 . 3 ) . Table 2 . 3 : Subjective and objective measures .

Participants were recruited from a university student population . This population was deemed to be relevant to this study as university students tend to spend a large amount of time performing seated work . All participants were free of low back pain for 12 months prior to the testing period . Before experiment began , participants gave informed consent and their personal details ( viz . gender , age and main occupation ) as well as anthropometric data ( viz . stature and weight ) were collected and reported in Table 2 . 4 . Table 2 . 4 : Anthropometric characteristics of participants .

For each testing session , a pressure mat was put on the seat cushion and secured with masking tape to facilitate seat adjustments . Each participant was instructed to sit carefully to minimize wrinkles on the pressure mat . Besides , in order to avoid that discomfort assessments could be affected by the visual impact with the tested chair , the participant was introduced into the room blindfolded and made to sit . Subsequently , the participant was asked to take off the blindfold and adjust the chair in such a way that the legs were in rest conditions and the feet were comfortably on the floor so as to form an angle between the thigh and the leg equal to 90° . Few minutes ( ≤5 ) were devoted to initial seat and posture adjustments , then the test session started . In each session , participants performed the task of reading a text on VDU for 20 minutes . At the end of the testing session , the participant was blindfolded again and taken back out of the room . The specific task of reading a text on VDU was chosen in order to minimize differences in postures among the participants due to the peculiarities in performing more complex task . Indeed , previous studies have shown that the type of computer workstation task performed has an effect on postural responses while sitting ( van Dieën et al . , 2001 ; Gregory et al . , 2006 ; Dunk and Callaghan , 2005 ; Moes , 2005 ; Ellegast et al . , 2012 ; Groenesteijn et al . , 2012 ) . The choice of short - term experimental session is recommended when using pressure mats in order to prevent the well - known effects of creep and / or hysteresis ( Fay and Brienza , 2000 ) . Moreover , long - term sessions are generally suggested when investigating sitting discomfort due to fatigue resulting from sources other than chair design ( Helander and Zhang , 1997 ; Kyung and Nussbaum , 2008 ) . 2 . 3 . 5 Data collection and processing The collection of subjective ratings was organised in such a way as to minimize confusion : the forms for the collection of the Discomfort Rating ( DR ) and the Discomfort Degree ( DD ) were administered to each participant immediately after each testing session ; instead , the Chair Ranking ( CR ) was collected only after the participant had tested all four office chairs . - 36 - Pressure data were divided into four groups ( Figure 2 . 4 ) and were collected continuously during the reading text on VDU , using a Novel Gmbh ( Munich , Germany ) pressure mat ( S2027 Pliance TM ) . The above pressure mat comprises 256 ( 16x16 ) thin ( < 1 . 2 mm ) capacitive sensors that could easily conform to the contour of the seat and measure pressures typically in a range from 0 . 2 N / cm 2 up to 6 N / cm 2 . Thanks to its flexible structure the mat is a minimally invasive instrument , which does not interfere with user perception of seat discomfort . The mat has an active area of 392 mm x 392 mm , and sensor pitch is 24 . 5 mm ( 0 . 167 sensor / cm 2 ) . Pressures were recorded at 50 Hz . This sampling rate was considered sufficient given the frequency of postural changes and resultant pressure changes ( Kyung and Nussbaum , 2008 ) . Contact area and contact pressure were calculated by including only data from sensors that were pressed at least once and average values were determined for the last 15 minutes of each session . Earlier data ( 5 min ) were excluded since they were transient due to settling into the chair ( Reed et al . , 1999 ) . Figure 2 . 4 : Division of pressure mat for four local body parts ( left , number of sensors in parentheses ) and exemplar pressure distribution ( right , a higher peak pressure on left buttock ) . - 37 - 2 . 3 . 6 Data analysis Data analysis aimed at answering the following three research questions : - Does a relationship between subjective evaluations and objective measurements of seat discomfort exist ? - How do anthropometric variability and differences in seat conditions affect contact pressures ? - Are indexes based on seat - interface pressure effective in predicting discomfort ? The first question was investigated by adopting two different multivariate approaches for the statistical analysis of collected data : the ( a ) PCR and the ( b ) PLSR . The ( a ) PCR data analysis procedure developed into three steps : at the first step the association among the three adopted evaluation scales was evaluated via the Goodman and Kruskall’s index in order to test the consistency of the subjective data and select the best proxy for perceived discomfort ; at the second step pressure and contact variables were analysed via Principal Component Analysis ( PCA ) in order to reduce the number of explanatory variables ; at third step a multiple regression of perceived discomfort on the PCA factors ( obtained at step 2 ) was performed . The number of PCA factors was determined by two criteria , the size of the eigenvalue ( > 1 ) and the cumulative percentage ( ≈90 % ) of variance accounted for . The ( b ) PLSR data analysis procedure provides a dimension reduction strategy in a single step . Such procedure tries to find the multidimensional direction in the X space , set of predictor variables , that explains the maximum variance direction in the Y space , one or a set of response variables . For this procedure has been used the same best response setting for PCR data analysis . The optimal number of components was determined by the cross - validation procedure with ‘Leave - one - out’ technique . Following the data analysis strategy proposed by Kyung and Nussbaum ( 2008 ) , all the collected contact area and pressure data were divided into four groups corresponding to four local body parts ( i . e . right / left buttock and right / left thigh see Figure 2 . 4 ) and a total of 27 explanatory variables were derived ( Table 2 . 5 on the next page ) to be used at step 2 of the data analysis procedure . The 1 - 9 variables were related to average contact areas and ratios ; the 10 - 18 variables described average contact pressures and ratios ; and the 19 - 27 variables indicated average peak contact pressures and ratios . The overall pressure variables ( caSUM , cpSUM , and pcpSUM ) were only used to derive the ratio variables but they were not further analysed . Statistical results were considered ‘significant’ or ‘marginal’ when p≤0 . 05 and 0 . 05 < p≤0 . 10 , respectively . - 38 - Table 2 . 5 : Contact area and pressure variables .

Pressure data were stratified by gender and seat condition so as to obtain 8 ( i . e . 2x4 ) strata . For each stratus a MPCP map was built ( Table 2 . 14 ) so that each map cell represents the greatest value among all ( peak ) contact pressures sampled from a particular sensor for a given stratus . Finally , the third question was evaluated by analysing the discriminant effectiveness of two specific indexes based on seat - interface pressure : the Peak of Contact Pressure ( PCP ) and the Weighted Pressure Comfort Loss ( WPCL ) . The PCP index is the overall maximum pressure value registered on the mat ( de Looze et al . , 2003 ; Dunk and Callaghan , 2005 ; Hamberg - van Reenen et al . , 2008 ) . The Weighted Pressure Comfort Loss ( WPCL ; Lanzotti et al . , 2011 ) is a discomfort index formulated under the assumptions that an ideal distribution of seat - interface pressures exists and that every deviation from it causes an increase in user’s seat discomfort . Under the reasonable assumption that small deviation are not relevant and that - 39 - larger deviations become increasingly important ( i . e . the larger the deviation , the larger the increase in user’s seat discomfort ) the comfort loss is assumed to be a quadratic function of the deviation from the ideal pressure value . The existence of an ideal seat pressure distribution is accepted in the specialized literature ( Kyung and Nussbaum , 2008 ; Fujimaki and Mitsuya , 2002 ) and it is generally believed that the ideal pattern of pressure distribution is obtained by uniformly distributing the body weight over the seating surface . Coherently with this assumption , for each user , the ideal pressure ( i . e . target pressure j x 0 ) can be defined as the mean pressure over the whole contact area ( or any partition of it ) . Let j n be the number of activated cells in the pressure map for the j - th user and ij x the pressure value measured by the i - th cell when the j - th user is seated , the target pressure is given by : j n i ij j n x x j ∑ = = 1 0 ( eq . 2 . 1 ) For each user and for each cell of the pressure map it is possible to evaluate the deviation of the observed pressure value , ij x , from the target pressure , j x 0 and thus identify the associated Pressure Comfort Loss ( PCL ) based on a ( Nominal the Best ) quadratic loss function . For the j - th user the pressure comfort loss at the i - th activated cell of the contact surface can be defined as : 2 0 0   − = j j ij ij ij ij x x x k x PCL ) ( ( eq . 2 . 2 ) where ij k is a proportionality coefficient that for each cell measures the loss corresponding to the maximum accepted deviation from the target pressure . In particular , let ij k be the maximum accepted relative deviation from ideal pressure at the i - th cell activated by the j - th user and let 0 C be the comfort loss due to uneven pressure , the proportionality coefficient ij k can be defined as follows : 20 ij ij C k ∆ = ( eq . 2 . 3 ) - 40 - For the sake of simplicity and without loss of generality , hereafter 0 C can be assumed unitary and ij ∆ can be assumed constant over all activated cells and over all the users belonging to the same target population Ω ( e . g . female or male users ) . Assuming the hypothesis of additivity of comfort loss function , the PCL index for the j - th user belonging to Ω is given by : ∑ = −Ω Ω   − ∆ = j n i j j ij j x x x x PCL 1 2 0 0 2 ) ( r ( eq . 2 . 4 ) where x r is a vector of dimension j n with generic element ij x and the proportionality coefficient Ω ∆ can be calculated by averaging the maximum relative deviations from ideal pressure over all pressure maps rated at the lowest level on the scale for perceived discomfort ( i . e . no discomfort ) . Starting from eq . 2 . 4 , the Weighted Pressure Comfort Loss for target population Ω can be defined as : j j j PCL W WPCL Ω Ω Ω ⋅ = ∑ ( eq . 2 . 5 ) where j W Ω is a weight that allows to account for the degree of anthropometrical representativeness of the j - th user inside the target population . The weights , j W Ω , via the discrete approximation of a continuous random variable ( e . g . the stature of potential users ) taken as representative of the population anthropometrical variability ( for further details see Lanzotti and Vanacore , 2007 ) Moreover , the overall Weighted Pressure Comfort Loss for a mixture of sub - populations can be obtained as follows : 1 = ⋅ = ∑ ∑ Ω k k k k k WPCL WPCL θ θ ; ( eq . 2 . 6 ) being k θ is the mixture parameter accounting for the representativeness of the ( sub ) population k Ω inside the overall population . Thus when dealing with an overall composed by female and male users , the WPCL index is obtained by summing up the gender specific WPCL indexes taking into account their mixture weight : ( ) 1 0 1 ≤ ≤ ⋅ − + ⋅ = F M F F F WPCL WPCL WPCL θ θ θ ; ( eq . 2 . 7 ) - 41 - 2 . 4 Results and Discussion 2 . 4 . 1 Explaining the relationship between subjective evaluations and objective measurements of seat discomfort via multivariate data analysis The Goodman and Kruskall’s index was calculated for all possible combinations of binary association among the adopted subjective evaluation scales . Results ( Table 2 . 6 ) show a substantial consistency of the tested evaluation scales . In fact , the minimum value for Goodman and Kruskall’s index in Table 2 . 6 is 0 . 653 revealing a medium - high level of association between the CR and DR scales . Since responses given on the DD scale were highly associated with both CR and DR scales ( 0 . 984 and 0 . 860 , respectively ) , this scale was selected as a good proxy of perceived discomfort and set as a robust response function for explorative data analysis via PCR . Table 2 . 6 : Results for association analysis on the subjective evaluation scales . Rating ( DR ) 0 . 984 0 . 653 Degree ( DD ) 0 . 860 Ranking ( CR ) ( a ) PCR Analysis From the PCA on the set of 27 variables listed and described in Table 2 . 5 ( page 34 ) , resulted five principal components with an eigenvalue > 1 accounted for 86 . 9 % of the total variance ( Table 2 . 7 on the next page ) . After varimax rotation , principal components appeared to have a more general interpretation ; indeed , for each of them a predominant subset of ( 2 - 4 ) pressure variables was found . Since these subsets of variables were mutually exclusive and distinguishable ( e . g . in terms of body part ) the components were termed accordingly to them . It is worthwhile to note that Factor 4 shows coefficients with opposite signs for thigh average contact area ratio and buttock average contact area ratio ( i . e . , caTL / caSUM vs . caBL / caSUM ) , providing some evidence of negative association in terms of contact area ratio between thigh and buttock . Fitted DD regression models were significant ( p≤0 . 01 ) for the whole sample of users ( i . e . group of mixed users ) as well as the two sub - samples obtained by stratifying by gender ( i . e . group of male users and group of female users ) ; however the five factors account for the DD of female users somewhat better than for the DD of male users and mixed users ( R 2 equals to 52 . 9 % , 23 . 7 % and 25 . 7 % , respectively ) . - 42 - Table 2 . 7 : Five principal components after varimax rotation ( underlined values are > 0 . 4 and maximal across factors in absolute value ) .

In particular , the coefficients for Factor 2 ( - 0 . 348 and - 0 . 360 for the whole sample and for the sub - sample of male users , respectively ) indicated that increasing contact areas at the buttocks ( specifically , caBL and caBR ) would be the most effective method for decreasing DD in particular in the group of male users . Similarly , the coefficients for Factor 1 ( 0 . 174 and 0 . 350 for the whole sample and for the sub - sample of female users , respectively ) suggest that decreasing average ( peak ) contact pressures and ratios relevant to the left buttock ( specifically , cpBL , pcpBL e pcpBL / pcpSUM ) would be the second most effective way of decreasing subjective perception of discomfort especially in the group of female users . Finally , the coefficients of Factor 5 ( - 0 . 206 and - 0 . 901 , for the whole sample and for the sub - sample of female users , respectively ) provides one more suggestion for seat design improvement consisting in decreasing contact pressure and peak at the right thigh ( specifically , cpTR and pcpTR ) , this action will be particularly effective on the group of female users .

Regression analysis showed that the components selected could explain better the DD for the Females sub - sample ( R 2 = 52 , 64 ; X - Var = 60 , 72 % ) than for the Males ( R 2 = 25 , 12 % ; X - Var = 32 , 82 % ) .

This consideration has suggested that the data could be affected by a noise higher than expected , although a strict experimental protocol was used . For this reason it was decided to filter the data by applying two criteria validation : 1 ) the consistency of the subjective evaluation in relation to the Seat Conditions ; 2 ) the Symmetry Index ( SI ) based on the body weight to detect a correct posture of the users . As regard the first criteria , the subjective evaluations clearly inconsistent were discarded . As regard the second criteria , data that reached a reliable score on the SI scale were selected . The SI index is expressed by the following formula : 100 ) ( ) ( 2 ⋅ + − ⋅ = unloaded Loaded unloaded Loaded W W W W SI ( eq . 2 . 8 ) Filtered data represent about the 25 % of the initial database . Subsequently on these , the approaches showed in subsections ( a ) and ( b ) were again performed . Rerunning the PCR the model was not significant due to the reduced filtered sample size . Instead , rerunning the PLSR the model was significant ( Table 2 . 12 on the next page ) and its performance indexes are higher than those of the model on unfiltered data ( Table 2 . 13 on the next page ) . In particular , the goodness of fit is about 79 % and the amount of variance in the predictors explained by the model selected is about 84 % . - 48 - Table 2 . 12 : ANOVA for DD on filtered data ( PLSR case ) .

Table 2 . 14 , reporting The MPCP maps can be arranged , can be read both by rows and by columns . In particular , the comparison by rows provides information on the effects of the anthropometric variability on seat - interface pressures . In fact , the female maps ( first row of Table 2 . 14 ) show PCP values lower than the corresponding male maps ( second row of Table 2 . 14 ) . On the contrary , the comparison by columns provides information on the effects of the Seat Conditions . It’s worthwhile to note that moving from the first column ( low Stiffness ) to the fourth one ( high Stiffness ) , PCP values gradually increase . Thus , it can be said that the first two Seat Conditions show pressure levels lower than the last two Seat Conditions for both males and females . Briefly , the MPCP maps in Table 2 . 14 point out that : 1 ) pressure levels and contact areas vary between males and females and 2 ) it would seem that the males are more sensitive to changes in the seat condition and this could mean an amplification of discomfort effects in the long period . Table 2 . 14 : Maps of the MPCP for the different sub - samples stratified by gender and seat condition . 0 1 2 3 F M - 50 - In addition the Quantile - Quantile plot in Figure 2 . 9 shows that , independently of the seat condition , the female users significantly differ from male users in terms of unloaded weight . In particular , quantiles of the unloaded weight are higher for female users than for male users . This result means that the location value of the unloaded weight is higher for female users than for male users ; however , the non - linearity in the Quantile - Quantile plot implies that the difference between the two samples is not explained simply by a shift in location .

F M 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 The obtained experimental results are consistent with the findings of previous studies ( Dunk and Callaghan , 2005 ; Gregory et al . , 2006 ; Beach et al . , 2008 ) investigating the influence of personal characteristics ( i . e . , gender and flexibility ) on postures adopted when performing seated computer work . These findings generally evidence that males and females react differently to seated exposures ; in particular , the study of Dunk and Callaghan ( 2005 ) suggests that men tend to slouch against the back rest while females perch closer to the front of the seat pan . The above gender - based differences have been related to inter - individual variations in hip , hamstring , and low - back flexibility . - 51 - 2 . 4 . 3 Discriminant effectiveness of indexes based on seat - interface pressure in predicting discomfort Mean values of PCP and WPCL were compared for the four tested chairs in order to verify the consistency of discriminant information provided by these indexes . The mean values of both indexes were calculated over the whole sample of users as well as over the two sub - samples of female users and male users . The results are shown in Figure 2 . 10 ( a ) and Figure 2 . 10 ( b ) for WPCL and PCP , respectively . Figure 2 . 10 : Mean effect plots assuming WPCL ( a ) and PCP ( b ) as response . ( a ) 0 , 0 0 , 1 0 , 2 0 , 3 0 , 4 0 , 5 0 , 6 F Mix M W P C L 0 1 2 3 ( b ) 0 , 5 1 , 0 1 , 5 2 , 0 2 , 5 3 , 0 F Mix M P C P 0 1 2 3 The two diagrams in Figure 2 . 10 show substantial coherence of the results provided by PCP and WPCL against increasing levels of Stiffness ( S ) : the Seat Condition characterized by Low Stiffness ( coded as 0 ) was the best one in terms of both WPCL and PCP , whereas - 52 - the worst results were obtained for the Seat Condition characterized by High Stiffness ( coded as 3 ) . For the Seat Condition 3 , the mean effect plots of WPCL and PCP are constant against changes in the composition of the reference ( sub - ) sample . This result could be explained by a saturation effect due to the rigid cushion which produces very high pressure values which are comparable to those ones obtained in previous studies on a hard flat surface ( Brienza and Karg , 1998 ; Ragan et al . , 2002 ) . On the other hand , a similar effect is shown for the Seat Condition 0 : the mean effect plots of both indexes , though not constant , show a lower slope compared to Seat Conditions 1 and 2 characterized by intermediate levels of Stiffness . This result could be explained as there were a point of diminishing returns beyond which decreasing the cushion stiffness is not really effective in further reducing the seat – interface pressure . A similar effect was found in a previous study with regard to cushion thickness ( Ragan et al . , 2002 ) . Though the mean effects plots of WPCL and PCP show similar patterns , it’s worthwhile to highlight that , in the WPCL diagram the differences between the mean effect plots of Seat Condition 0 and 1 are clearer than in the PCP diagram . In order to verify if the two indexes significantly differ in discriminating among the four Seat Conditions , the Wilcoxon - Mann - Whitney test was performed . So for both indexes , three binary comparisons of Seat Conditions ( 0 vs . 1 , 1 vs . 2 and 2 vs . 3 ) were carried out for the whole sample of users as well as the two sub - samples of Females and Males . Results ( in Table 2 . 15 ) show that , independently from the composition of the reference ( sub - ) sample , the WPCL is able to discriminate between the Seat Conditions 0 and 1 , and between 1 and 2 ; whereas , the PCP only distinguishes between the Seat Conditions 1 and 2 .

Indeed , for the sub - sample of male users , the maximum values of these indexes refer to different pressure maps and so identify different users ( Table 2 . 16 on the next page ) . - 53 - Table 2 . 16 : Pressure maps related to maximum values of WPCL and PCP . PCP : P . 18 – Seat Cond . 2 WPCL : P . 10 – Seat Cond . 3 M 2 . 5 Conclusions This study provides satisfactory answers to some relevant issues related to the assessment of sitting discomfort due to office chairs . Subjective discomfort evaluations resulted significantly correlated to several combinations of pressure variables , derived in terms of average contact area and average ( peak ) contact pressure . Consequently , these variables can be used across anthropometric variability for the assessment of static sitting discomfort in short - experimental sessions . In particular , the perceived discomfort appears to be mainly due to the lack of pressure balance between the bilateral buttocks and the lack of balance in contact areas between buttocks and thighs . Thus , asymmetries in pressure distributions and in contact areas should be considered undesirable as they lead to increasing unpleasant state of human body . The experimental results confirm the hypotheses that due to fundamental biomechanical differences in their sitting behaviours , males and females are exposed to different loading patterns and experience different discomfort pathways . The adopted statistical approach can effectively support the designer in diagnosing seat discomfort ( via the MPCP maps ) and testing ( via the WPCL index ) alternative design solutions ( e . g . in terms of both shape and materials ) for specific purposes ( e . g . design for a specific user or design for a generic user ) . Though the paper focus is on the comparative assessment of office seating discomfort across a gender stratified population of healthy users , the proposed data analysis strategy can be easily adapted to other experimental seating contexts involving different target populations . - 54 - 2 . 6 References Andreoni , G . , Santambrogio , G .

A New Approach for GUI Usability Assessment 3 . 1 User Interface Problems and the “Magic number 5” A well - thought - out study have to consider questions how to select participants , how to order tasks , what participants perform what tasks , and how many participants you need to get a reasonably reliable feedback . Only if you design in this direction you can save time and effort , and answer research questions that your study arises clearly ( Tullis and Albert , 2008 ) . One of the most debated issues in specialized literature is related to the choice of the right number of users to be involved in the usability tests . Early some researchers suggested that about five to six users could detect the most of the problems in a usability test ( Al - Awar et al . , 1981 ) . Lewis ( 1982 ) published the first study describing how the binomial distribution can be used to model the sample size required to reveal usability problems . It’s based on the probability of discovering a problem with probability p for a given set of tasks and user population given a sample size n . During the ‘90 years , the use of GUIs spreads rapidly and the need for more precision in sample size estimates generates some studies which proposing the binomial model ( Virzi , 1990 ; Wright and Monk , 1991 ; Virzi , 1992 ; Nielsen and Landauer , 1993 ; Lewis , 1993 ; Lewis , 1994 ) . However , the controversy arose in 2000 when Nielsen published “Why you only need to test with 5 users” . Ever since many strong opinions about the “magic number 5” were stated ( Caulton , 2001 ; Spool and Schroeder , 2001 ; Perfetti and Landesman , 2001 ; Turner et al . 2002 ; Wixon , 2003 ; Lewis , 2001 ; Hertzum and Jacobsen , 2003 ; Woolrych and Cockton , 2001 ; Bevan et al . 2003 ; Turner et al . 2006 ; Lewis , 2006 ; Lindgaard and Chattratichart , 2007 ; Schmettow , 2008 ) . The magic number 5 is derived from the number of users required to detect 85 % of the problems in an interface , assuming that the probability that a user would have to tackle a problem is about 31 % . Sauro in 2010 seems to have settled the problem as it has been shown convincingly that does not exist a specific number of users that will always be the right number but testing with 5 users may be all you need to find out the problems in an interface . The discussion has not focused on the use of the binomial formula ( or Poisson equivalent ) but on the value of the model parameter . Such parameter represents the average frequency with which - 58 - problems really occur . Given that the problems do not affect users evenly , it is not easy to know how frequently they occur . As a general rule you could use a probability of 31 % ( or more ) for early design whereas 10 % ( or lower ) for applications in use that have many users . Nielsen recommends to test not more than 5 users at a time . This does not mean that the 5 users are in total , in fact , you could test up to 20 users , i . e . 4 or 5 set of 5 users . For this reason the best approach when you plan an usability study is an iterative design and test strategy . 3 . 2 Introducing the case study Large and small companies develop products through structured work teams supported by software toolsets aimed to keep up their design ( Sharmin et al . , 2009 ) . These tools are generally complex and require skilled users dealing with design , test and check activities . The main issue is that these users are geographically dispersed and interdepartmental ( Stenzel and Pourroy , 2008 ) besides the design and manufacturing process often aren’t concurrent but they turn in the loop . This induce a data flow loop which move through some division in the world . Systems , procedures and software to capture and manage design and manufacturing data are necessary to ride out these issues . Some authors ( Elgueder et al . , 2010 ; El Hani et al . , 2012 ) propose software tools to concurrent manage design and manufacturing process data . In such context , a “Digital Pattern” ( DP ) platform is recommended . A DP platform is a set of geometric and numeric data structures , as well as of preconfigured and parametric models , which can be adapted to specific contexts . Therefore , a DP acts as a knowledge - based engineering ( KBE ) system aimed to improve quality and reduce times and costs for product development through a massive use of knowledge and tools integration inside company . Such aims are accomplished through the fast and the best re - use of company knowledge , i . e . through technical and technological predefined solutions that quickly marry new projects , allowing fast performance evaluations and immediate checks . Such solutions should also be able to give feedbacks on design and production costs . In papers by Lanzotti et al . ( 2013 ) and Patalano et al . ( 2013 ) a DP system , developed to assist gearbox design , is described . When developing a KBE system , the evaluation of interface usability , to demonstrate the effective reduction of development time and satisfaction in use , is a critical point . Indeed , usability can be defined as the extent to which specific users , in a specific context of - 59 - utilisation , can use a product to their satisfaction , in order to effectively and efficiently achieve specific goals ( Madhavan and Alagarsamy , 2013 ) . Sohaib and Khan ( 2010 ) claim that agile projects needs to adopt aspects of usability engineering by incorporating user scenarios and including usability specialists in the team . During the designing of mechanical parts , designers need to verify the correctness of the hypotheses in use , especially in relation with multi - objective tasks ( Patalano et al . , 2013 ) . Furthermore , the use of a KBE system is strategic for designers if we consider that they spend up to 30 % of their time to searching data ( Sandeberg , 2003 ) and this percentage rises up to 50 % when we take into account the time spent to validating the data ( Bourke , 2013 ) . Following the approach used by Di Gironimo et al . ( 2013 ) , this work proposes the usability improvement of the KBE system’s Graphical User Interface ( GUI ) through a participatory testing . This GUI assists designing automotive manual transverse gearboxes . An approach based on Analytic Hierarchy Process ( AHP ) and Multiple - Criteria Decision Analysis ( MCDA ) is used . A participatory test was performed for evaluating the Usability Index ( UI ) of the GUI . The AHP approach implies the decomposition of the problem into several levels ( Saaty , 2008 ) . In the present work , three dimensions of UI are considered : Effectiveness , Efficiency and Satisfaction . The MCDA methodology implies that all the measures corresponding to the factors of the problem , being of different nature and magnitude , are first normalized and weighed , and then could be combined into one overall value through a bottom - up approach ( Sauro and Kindlund , 2005a ; Kim and Han , 2008 ) . For the experimental phase , a set of selected end - users has to complete two specific tasks : 1 ) to design an automotive manual transverse gearbox ; 2 ) to modify an existing gearbox model re - using previous knowledge . The goals of both Task 1 and Task 2 are clearly defined . Then , measures of subjective ratings and objective metrics are collected . So , the UI is calculated and the effects of the usability dimensions are analysed . Taking into account the experimental data analysis , some frequent critical issues are identified . Before making any changes to the GUI , a questionnaire is administrated to the same users of the previous experiment to confirm the validity of new conceptual features proposed . In this perspective , a new release of the GUI is developed and the validation test is again performed for a new assessment of the GUI , according to a continuous improvement loop . - 60 - 3 . 3 The Methodological approach The traditional design process tends to favour the functional aspects of a product at the expense of the cognitive - emotional ones , not considering that a product can even have only an emotional function ( Norman , 2004 ) . The usability assessment must take into account the analysis of both objective and subjective aspects that are closer to the emotional sphere of the individual . In this respect , the participation of the end - user into design process is crucial according to a User - Centred Design approach . Using such assumptions and starting from ( Di Gironimo et al . , 2013 ) , the approach adopted to achieve the purpose of this study requires the involvement of potential users during all phases of the usability evaluation process ( Nielsen , 1993 ) . Figure 3 . 1 shows the logical flow chart of proposed methodological approach . Figure 3 . 1 : The logic flow chart of methodological approach . In summary , both the user profile and the GUI characteristics are identified . Given these requirements and the context of use , the develop design solutions are implemented and the usability testing are planned . Two specific tasks , devoted to translate the usability characteristics factors into measurable usability functions , are properly defined . In order to reduce the noise related to the user’s skill , a training phase is conducted for all users . Then , the experimental data are collected and the GUI evaluation is settled . - 61 - As stated before , the GUI usability assessment is carried out by using Saaty’s AHP ( Saaty , 2008 ) and MCDA methodology ( Figueira et al . , 2005 ) . The analysis can be summarised as follows : - decomposition of the problem into several hierarchical levels and factors ; - scoring of the factors related to each identified level by means of pairwise comparison . In particular , MCDA methodology allows combining the values of the individual usability functions into a single usability index ( UI ) by means of a bottom - up approach ( Sauro and Kindlund , 2005a ; Kim and Han , 2008 ) . Starting from results of experimental data , some changes are proposed . Finally , the validation experiment is performed to verify the goodness of these changes . 3 . 3 . 1 User Profile Definition and GUI characteristics A KBE system can assist engineers in re - using previous knowledge in order to improve time - consuming tasks , as retrieval and selection of previous architectures , and to modify and virtually test a new product design . A critical point in the development of a KBE system is the interface usability to demonstrate effective reduction of development time and satisfaction in its use . Specifically , the present work deals with a KBE system previously proposed and providing to assist within the design of automotive manual transverse gearboxes . Then , the GUI for the KBE system is released ( Figure 3 . 2 ) . GUI interaction depends primarily on the kind of user and the context of use . All characteristics , which identify specific needs , desires and interests and even behaviours , contexts of use and personal preferences ( Ghosh and Dekhil , 2009 ) , define a specific user profile . The MatLAB ® - based GUI is accomplished for junior designers belonging to automotive industry . Their minimum skills is defined as follows : 1 ) good knowledge ( at least theoretical ) of a gearbox , 2 ) good expertise with the use of graphical user interfaces , and more generally , with the use of specialised software . Hence , the GUI should easily satisfy user needs with no cognitive overload . The GUI is designed to perform two major tasks : 1 ) to design gearboxes rapidly , reducing the risks of using incomplete information when making product development decisions ; 2 ) to assist the designer in redesigning the gearboxes previously developed ( for more details see Lanzotti et al . , 2013 ; Patalano et al . , 2013 ) . - 62 - Figure 3 . 2 : GUI for the gearbox CAD modelling software tool . The window is divided in three main fields ( Figure 3 . 2 ) : the upper field where the gearbox is pre - configured ; the middle field where the gearbox is configured and the gears are characterised ; the lower field where the post - processing and evaluating commands are located . The designers could set : type of gearbox ( selecting it from a list box ) ; number of gears ( up to six ) ; layout parameters ( axle bases and angle between them ) . Besides , designers could set three characteristic parameters for each gear : gear ratio , pressure angle and helical angle ( all in viable range ) . Teeth numbers of the gear are automatically generated by means of an algorithm that pulls out ten set of teeth numbers that meet the three parameters of the gear . Specific panels to set reverse and differential gear are developed . A new gearbox can be defined by setting these parameters , but a previous i . e . existing design can also be edited . The computational structure is guided by a directed graph ( digraph ) . The nodes are associated to parameters ( dependent and independent ) , while directed edges represent the mathematical relationships among parameters . The “Graph” button displays the digraph in a new window where the designer is able to interact with the graph : for example removing relations and generating an isolated node , in order to set a constant value during the calculation step . - 63 - As regards the post - processing , the “Dependent Parameters” command displays all computed parameters useful to determine the geometry correctness ( modules , pitch diameters , addendum ( or outside ) diameters , root diameters , base diameters , etc ) . The “Plot” command and “Gear Case” command display the mesh representation of the gears and the gear case , respectively . The automatically generated models can be exported both as txt and stl files , so ensuring the generation of the corresponding 3D solid models in any CAD environment . The bounding box of generated meshes can be shown and this option helps the designer to interactively set the gearbox parameters as to fit the whole gearbox within a desired volume . 3 . 3 . 2 The AHP model for GUI usability Figure 3 . 3 shows the decomposition of the usability according to the AHP approach . At first level we set the GUI usability ( U ) that is decomposed according to ( ISO 9241 - 11 - 1998 ; Hornbaek , 2006 ) in Usability Dimensions ( UDs ) , whit in the second level . The UDs are defined as follows : - Effectiveness , the level of accuracy and completeness with which users achieve a specified goal ; - Efficiency , the level of effectiveness achieved to the expenditure of resources ; - Satisfaction , the condition of freedom from discomfort and positive attitude towards the use of the product . Figure 3 . 3 : GUI Usability hierarchical decomposition . In turn , the UDs are broken down , at the third level , in Usability Functions ( UFs ) that are strictly related to the experimental tasks . These UFs , in fact , are accurately determined - 64 - during the experimental phase and they tackle critical aspects for GUI usability assessment . According to the hierarchical decomposition above described , the analysis of GUI characteristics provides the following UFs : - Number of Errors ( NE ) , measure of Effectiveness , is the number of error messages reported by the GUI during the task execution ; - Task Completion ( TC ) , measure of Effectiveness , is the level of completion and accuracy in achieving the goals of the task ; - Number of Operations ( NO ) , measure of efficiency , is defined as the number of operations used to complete a task in terms of mouse clicks and keystrokes ; - Time ( T ) , measure of efficiency , is the effective time to perform a task or sub - activities ; - Post Session Ratings ( PSR ) , measure of Satisfaction , is a score , which expresses the feeling of users about the GUI use . 3 . 3 . 3 The Usability Index definition Starting from the assumption that the factors of the hierarchy , for each level , are preferentially independent to each other , a simple linear additive evaluation model could be applied . By means of Multi - Criteria Decision Analysis ( MCDA ) all the measures corresponding to the factors could be combined into one overall value ( Sauro and Kindlund , 2005a ; Kim and Han , 2008 ) . In particular , the measure of each factor is multiplied by a weight based on a specific criterion , and then the weighted scores are summed up . The calculation of the index starts from the UFs , by using experimental data . Being data of different nature and magnitude , a preliminary normalisation is required , in order to ensure the comparison between them . The normalisation techniques , adopted for the specific UFs , are briefly described in the following : - 0 - Max normalisation performs a linear transformation of the original data . The considered value e ij is transformed in a new value e’ ij ranged in the interval [ 0 , 1 ] using the equation ( eq . 3 . 1 ) : i ij ij e e max ' = ( eq . 3 . 1 ) - 65 - - Min / e ij normalisation performs a linear transformation of the original data that reverses the direction of preferences . The considered value e ij is transformed in a new value e’ ij ranged in the interval [ 0 , 1 ] using the equation ( eq . 3 . 2 ) : ij i ij e e min ' = ( eq . 3 . 2 ) - e target / e ij normalisation performs a linear transformation of the original data that reverses the direction of preferences and requires a target value , lower than the minimal value . The considered value e ij is transformed in a new value e’ ij ranged in the interval [ 0 , 1 ] using the formula ( eq . 3 . 3 ) : ij et t ij e e e arg ' = ( eq . 3 . 3 ) The above techniques adopted for each UF are reported in Table 3 . 1 . Table 3 . 1 : Normalisation techniques adopted for UFs . Normalisation technique Usability Functions max − 0 PSR ij i e min NE , TC ij et t e e arg NO , T The outcomes of the normalisation procedure are the usability measures ( um i ) that range from 0 to 1 . Then , for each subgroup of usability measures , the Usability Dimension Index ( UDI ) is defined ( eq . 3 . 4 ) : i n i i i um w UDI ⋅ = ∑ = 1 ( eq . 3 . 4 ) where w i is the weight of each usability measure , that could be different , based on the level of priority of usability measures in the specific application . The three usability dimension indexes are : 1 ) the Effectiveness index ; 2 ) the Efficiency index ; 3 ) the Satisfaction index . - 66 - The weighted sum of these three indexes provides the overall results for the UI ( eq . 3 . 5 ) : i n i i UDI w UI ⋅ = ∑ = 1 ( eq . 3 . 5 ) In details , the AHP is applied in order to evaluate the relevance of the factors in the hierarchy , taking into account the analysis of GUI interaction . Starting from the hierarchy structure of the model , the matrix of weights is defined . Such matrix is accomplished for each level of the hierarchy and for each group ( elements in the lower level hinge on the same element in the upper level ) , by placing the elements of the group both on matrix rows and columns . Hence , all the elements of the same group are compared in pairs . The generic matrix element a ij is the result of the pairwise comparison between the attribute of the row i - th and the column j - th , with respect to a certain task , using the Saaty scale i . e . a 9 - points scale anchored at the end with the terms “Equivalent alternatives” and “The chosen alternative is absolutely better than the other one” . Thus , the main diagonal of the matrix consists of unit elements only , while the values of the other cells are always positive , according to the reciprocity property ( eq . 3 . 6 ) : ij ij a a 1 = ( eq . 3 . 6 ) Once the pairs comparison matrix is defined , the weight of each element is assumed as ( eq . 3 . 7 ) : [ ] n j i a a w n n i n j ij n n j ij i , , ; 1 1 1 1 1 1 =           = ∑ ∏ ∏ = = = ( eq . 3 . 7 ) In eq . 3 . 7 , n is the dimension of the metrics related to the element at issue . In particular , the allocation of weights is done with a bottom - up logic , from the lowest level of the hierarchy ( UFs ) to the highest ( Usability ) . - 67 - 3 . 4 Experimental phase 3 . 4 . 1 Overview of experiment Based on of the requirements identified in section 3 . 3 . 1 , participants are 12 newly graduated engineers ( i . e . mechanical , electrical and management ) aged between 27 - 32 years , attending a specialised course in Computer - Aided Design within a project named Digital Pattern Product Development . The experiments are performed at the Fraunhofer JL IDEAS - COGITO laboratory , Department of Industrial Engineering of the University of Naples ( IT ) in a suitable room , with no furniture and equipped with a Visual Display Unit ( VDU ) . Preliminarily , a GUI Tutorial is defined to present the graphical interface , to explain the procedures for data entry and to discuss about the functions of the interface . An example is also illustrated . An experimental session is performed . In such session , each user has to complete two specific tasks : 1 ) to design an automotive manual transverse gearbox ; 2 ) to modify an existing gearbox model re - using previous knowledge . The goals of the Task 1 are the follows : - to design a new gearbox according to the specifications assigned ( i . e . the parameters of six gears , of differential and of reverse ) ; - to plot the gearbox designed ; - to assess the overall dimensions ; - to save the model ; - to export the model . Whereas , the goals of the Task 2 are the follows : - to modify the gearbox designed in the first task , according to new instructions ( i . e . it was asked to change the some parameters of the gears and of the layout controller ) ; - to plot the gearbox modified ; - to assess the overall dimensions ; - to save the model ; - to export the model . Therefore , the measures of subjective ratings ( TC and PSR ) and objective metrics ( NO , T and NE ) are obtained . - 68 - 3 . 4 . 2 Experimental protocol Several days before the test session , a preparatory meeting with the participation of users involved in the tests is accomplished . The purpose of the incoming experimentation and the functionality of GUI are presented . A detailed description of the Tutorial is given . On the day fixed for the tests and before starting , users are informed , once again , that the aim of the experiment is to evaluate the GUI usability , and not the user’s ability to quickly perform a set of assigned tasks . In this way , we try to minimize the “stress” that , generally , may affect the outcome of a proof . The inspectors show the procedures of the experimental session , with particular attention to the rules of test performing . Then , they provide further details about the Tutorial and they administrate the short questionnaire for the personal details and for the informed agreement to users . The questionnaire is filled and returned before the start of the test . Finally , an ID code to each user is assigned . Users test the GUI individually and in random order to avoid noise factors . During the test , the inspectors record many details : the start and the ending time of the tasks , any notes on the bringing of the test , the number and kind of assistance provided . Specifically , if the user explicitly required the assistance , then the inspector invites him to consult the Tutorial ( classifying this as a level 1 assistance ) . Otherwise , if the user was not able to continue the test , the inspector removes all doubts ( classifying this as a level 2 assistance ) . The time limit for each test is set at 30 minutes after which the user is asked to suspend the operations ( Sauro and Kindlund , 2005b ) . After completing both tasks the questionnaire is administered to each user for detecting the PSR measurement . The procedures described above is also applied to the validation test . 3 . 4 . 3 Data collection and processing All the UFs measures are collected . Table 3 . 2 ( on the next page ) summarises the sources related to UFs . In particular , an open source software is used to record all user’s activities carried out during the experimental phase . Such tool is used to collect the NE , TC , NO and T metrics . The Effectiveness metrics are described in the following . - 69 - Table 3 . 2 : The sources of UFs . UDs UFs Source Number of errors ( NE ) Video test Effectiveness Task Completion ( TC ) Panel of experts Number of operations ( NO ) Efficiency Time ( T ) Video test Satisfaction Post - Session Ratings ( PSR ) Questionnaire Effectiveness metrics : - The Number of Errors ( NE ) are derived from the video by counting each time the GUI reports an error message . - The Task Completion ( TC ) are measured using a rating given by a panel of experts who are asked to assess the completeness of the goals reached for all the activities performed in the test , by using the following six - point scale : ( 1 ) Complete success without assistance , ( 2 ) Complete success with assistance , ( 3 ) Partial success without assistance , ( 4 ) Partial success with assistance , ( 5 ) Failure : the user does not understand that the task is not complete , ( 6 ) Failure : the user does not complete the task despite the assistance . The references to determine the level of completion in task execution is decided beforehand ( Tullis and Albert , 2008 ) . Efficiency metrics : - The Number of Operations ( NO ) are derived from video by counting , from time to time , the operations that are performed to complete the task . - The Time ( T ) is measured by the inspector as the difference between the ending and the beginning time of the session . This measure is subsequently validated by a comparison with the clock of VDU shown in video recordings . Satisfaction metrics : - the Post - Session Ratings ( PSR ) are gained from the specific questionnaire that users filled out at the end of the session test ( i . e . both Task 1 and Task 2 ) . In particular , they are asked to express their agreement related to ten statements , all set in a positive sense , by using a seven - point scale , whose ends were the positions : “strongly agree” and “strongly disagree” . In the calculation phase , the total value of each UF is obtained as the sum of the measures / ratings respectively noted to perform both the Task 1 and Task 2 , for the same - 70 - user . This operation is repeated for all users . For the calculation of the UI , the average values ( arithmetic mean ) of all aforementioned UFs are used . The procedures described above to collect and process data are also applied to the validation test . The experiment in numbers : 1 laboratory was used ; 1 usability team consisting of 6 engineers , 1 panel of experts and 12 end - users were involved ; 2 usability testing sessions were performed ; over 4 hours of video footage and ca . 200 questions were examined . 3 . 5 Results and discussion The following data are obtained . Table 3 . 3 shows the normalized measures of UFs for each user . According to the above UI definition ( section 3 . 2 . 3 ) , the average values of UFs are obtained using the collected measurements . The weights ( w ) of UFs are obtained submitting Saaty’s questionnaire to a panel of experts and using the Equation 3 . 7 , as summarised in Table 3 . 4 . Table 3 . 3 : Normalized measures of UFs .

So , it is calculated the usability index : the value obtained is equal to 0 . 42 , but this is not acceptable . - 71 - Table 3 . 5 : Weights and values of UDs . Effectiveness Efficiency Satisfaction w i 0 . 59 0 . 31 0 . 10 UDI i 0 . 31 0 . 49 0 . 79 The Table 3 . 5 shows that the Satisfaction index ( UDI satisfaction ) is the highest ( 79 % ) . However , this value could be smaller as the degree of Satisfaction of the users could be influenced by the achievement of the goal ( i . e . the effective gearbox modeling ) rather than the difficulties they overcome in using interface . In this case , the Satisfaction is the usability dimension that has a “reduced” effect ( 10 % , see Table 3 . 5 ) on the calculation of the global index . Hence , results in Table 3 . 5 suggest that the primary strategy for improving the usability of the GUI is to increase in Effectiveness values by acting mainly on the usability functions Number of Errors ( NE ) . Whereas achieving a higher Efficiency value , by leveraging on the usability functions Time , may be the second strategy to improve the GUI usability . Furthermore , both Task 1 and Task 2 are divided into the following critical sub - activities : the choice of the gearbox architecture , the choice of the number of gears , the setting of the dependent parameters , the setting of the wheel parameters , the setting of the reverse gear , the setting of the parameters of differential , the overall dimensions , the procedure for file exporting . In this perspective , the measurement of Efficiency is analysed . Figure 3 . 4 ( on the next page ) shows the radar chart that highlights how the normalized average value , related to the number of operations due for each sub - task , departs from the normalized optimal value ( equal to 1 ) . For example the value 3 , related to one of the axes , means that , on average , the number of operations necessary to accomplish that specific subtask is three times higher than the ideal value . Figure 3 . 4 points out that the more critical sub - tasks , involved in the Task 1 , are ( in descending order ) : the setting of the parameters of the differential ( 6 . 10 ) , the setting of the reverse gear ( 5 . 29 ) , the file exporting ( 4 . 42 ) , the setting of the gear parameters ( 2 . 43 ) . Further results for Task 2 are : the setting of the reverse gear ( 4 . 17 ) and setting of the differential parameters ( 2 . 35 ) . Time is another critical UF . It’s worthwhile to note that if we consider only the users who complete the tasks with success and without assistance , the average Time recorded is almost double than the predetermined optimum value . More generally , the average additional time to complete the Task 1 is much greater than the one related to the Task 2 as well as the variability of the measures ( Figure 3 . 5 on the next page ) . This may indicate a good level of learnability of the GUI . - 72 - Y : rotation of the optimal number of operations 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Export file Gears number Independent parameters Wheels parameters Reverse Differential parameters Overall dimensions Task 1 Task 2 Figure 3 . 4 : Number of Operations related to each sub - activity . 0 100 200 300 400 500 A v g . A dd i t i on a l T i m e ( sec ) t o C o m p l e t e T ask Task 1 Task 2 Figure 3 . 5 : Average Additional Time to complete Task 1 and Task 2 . Tackling the measures of Effectiveness , it’s worthwhile to note that there are no significant differences between the number of errors related to the Task 1 and Task 2 , but the average values are not negligible ( Figure 3 . 6 on the next page ) . - 73 - Figure 3 . 6 : Cumulative frequency of number of errors related to each task and average values . The values of Task Completion , grouped using the level of success , are depicted in Figure 3 . 7 . In particular , most users carry out the Task 1 in a complete success . Otherwise , in the accomplishment of Task 2 , only 1 user completely achieves the goals ( complete success ) , while 10 users get a partial success . There is also 1 user who fails . 0 % 20 % 40 % 60 % 80 % 100 % Task 2 Task 1 % of Participants Complete Partial Failure Figure 3 . 7 : Stacked bar chart showing different levels of success based on task completion . - 74 - The measures of Satisfaction is analysed . Figure 3 . 8 shows that the lowest value of the Satisfaction is related to the clarity and effectiveness of the GUI ( D8 ) , while the highest value is related to the actual benefit perceived in the use of the GUI , during the improvement of the gearbox design ( D5 ) . 0 % 20 % 40 % 60 % 80 % 100 % D1 - OVERALL IT WAS EASY TO USE THE GUI D2 - IT WAS EASY TO COMPLETE THE TASKS USING THIS GUI D3 - I WAS ABLE TO QUICKLY COMPLETE TASKS USING THE GUI D4 - IT WAS QUICK AND EASY TO LEARN TO USE GUI D5 - I BELIEVE THAT THE USE OF THE GUI COULD IMPROVE THE DESIGN PHASE OF A GEARBOX D6 - THE SYSTEM GAVE ERROR MESSAGES THAT CLEARLY EXPLAINED HOW TO SOLVE PROBLEMS D7 - INFORMATION ( SUCH AS TUTORIALS , ON - SCREEN MESSAGES AND EXPLANATIONS OF THE MODERATORS ) PROVIDED WERE CLEAR D8 - I LIKE TO USE THE GUI D9 - THE GUI HAS ALL THE FEATURES AND OPTIONS THAT I EXPECT SHOULD HAVE A ASSISTANCE SOFTWARE TO THE GEARBOX D10 - OVERALL , I AM SATISFIED WITH THE GUI Percentage Rating ( higher = perceived as easier ) Figure 3 . 8 : Average subjective ratings split by statement . Some frequent critical issues are identified by analysing videos related to the tests ( Table 3 . 6 on the next page ) . These problems involve difficulties in achieving the Tasks and they generally cause an increase of the operating time also due to a more than proportional increasing number of operations to be performed . In some cases , the user is confused and , then , she / he is led to an error or makes continuous action controls . - 75 - Table 3 . 6 : Root causes and corrective actions of the critical issues identified . # Root Cause Corrective Action UD 1 The default fields are not empty The default fields are empty Efficiency 2 The interface does not allow you to overwrite the selected values in the fields , you are forced to cancel the existing It’s possible to overwrite the selected values Efficiency 3 Poor visibility of function for exporting the file A new visibility was given to the button to export the files Efficiency 4 Poor functionality of the reset function A new reset function was upgraded Effectiveness 5 The user does not have a feedback on the correct setting of the parameters The button on the control panel is divided and a section with the new ( TEST ) or upgraded ( RESET ) functions , and a new confirmation command ( SET ) are inserted . The latter turns on only when the input parameters are correct . In this way it provides an immediate feedback to the user . Effectiveness 6 Poor visibility of the zoom function A new visibility is given to the button aimed to Zoom Efficiency 7 Inconsistency of the provision of the sections in the main window A new provision of sections , with different background colours , that promotes the logical procedure for the input of project data is introduced Effectiveness Once these critical issues are identified , the GUI is re - designed . However , in order to avoid radical changes and with the aim to improve UD Effectiveness and Efficiency , the new GUI is developed but it keeps the initial sizes . So , all corrective actions listed in Table 3 . 6 are considered . In order to confirm the validity of the new features a pairwise comparison between them is performed . For each upgrade , users are asked to rate the GUI with the new functions . They express their degree of preference on a scale of six points . The results of survey demonstrate a preference of the users for all new functions far higher than the initial ones . Hence , all the new features are definitively implemented and a new release of GUI is developed ( Figure 3 . 9 on the next page ) . Finally , the validation test is accomplished in order to assess again the UI , according a continuous improvement loop . - 76 - Figure 3 . 9 : The new release of GUI . Five users who tested the GUI in the first test are involved in the new validation test . Similarly to the first experimentation , the UI is calculated . In particular , the same weights of both UFs and UDs are used . In particular , the normalization measures of UFs are depicted ( Table 3 . 7 ) and the UFs and UDs values are obtained ( Tables 3 . 8 - 3 . 9 respectively ) . Table 3 . 7 : Normalized measures of UFs in the validation test .

Effectiveness Efficiency Satisfaction w i 0 . 59 0 . 31 0 . 10 UDI i 0 . 56 0 . 76 0 . 90 - 77 - The UI obtained is equal to 0 . 66 . The overall GUI usability improvement is of 57 % . For each usability dimension , the following percentage changes are registered : the Effectiveness UD increases of 81 % , the Efficiency UD of 56 % and the Satisfaction UD of 14 % . It’s worthwhile to note the following improvements related to Effectiveness UD : the average NE decreases of 53 % ; the percentage of users able to complete with success the session test increases of 23 % while those who are able to partially complete decreases of 28 % . These results have a positive effects on TC measurement . As regard the Efficiency UD , we highlight that the average T decreases of 22 % . In particular , T decreases of 6 % in Task 1 , while decreases of 41 % in Task 2 . Also the Satisfaction UD increases . A further investigation is carried out . Considering the paired data , matched samples , Wilcoxon - signed - rank test is used ( Wilcoxon , 1945 ) to determine whether there is a significant difference between the average values of the PSR made under two different conditions ( i . e . GUI before and after the changes ) . Both PSR measurements are made on each unit in a sample , and the test is based on the paired differences between these two values . The null hypothesis is the difference in the mean values is zero . Because the p - value is low ( < 7 % ) , we can be assume that the changes have produced a significant effect on GUI usability . 3 . 6 Conclusions The present study tackles the usability assessment of a GUI that is a part of a KBE system . To this aim , starting from a method for usability assessment successfully applied to a new product proposed by Di Gironimo et al . ( 2013 ) , a new approach to evaluate the usability of a GUI is discussed . A new usability index ( UI ) is proposed based on AHP model and its use is validated thanks to experimental results . In particular , the experimental data , leading to a lower value for UI ( 0 . 42 ) , are collected and discussed . Then , taking into account such experimental data , a new release of the GUI is proposed and a new set of experimentations are carried out in order to validate the new release . According to the validation test , the UI achieves the value of 0 . 66 i . e . it shows an increase equal to 57 % . Such improvement induces to state that the use of the new release of the GUI could improve the KBE system and contribute to reduce the development time of gearboxes . Further steps deal with evaluation and improvement of the new GUI . In fact , by using the present approach , new characteristics of GUI are discovered during the experimental sessions and could be introduced and evaluated , in iterative way . - 78 - 3 . 7 References Al - Awar , J . , Chapanis , A . , Ford , R . , 1981 .
