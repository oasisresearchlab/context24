Such cues are thought to be detected by specialized mechanosen - sing molecules linked to the cytoskeleton , an intracellular network of protein filaments that provide mechanical rigidity to the cell and drive cellular shape change . The most abundant such filament , actin , forms branched networks nucleated by the actin - related protein ( Arp ) 2 / 3 complex that support or induce membrane pro - trusions and display adaptive behavior in response to compressive forces . Here we show that filamentous actin serves in a mechano - sensitive capacity itself , by biasing the location of actin branch nucleation in response to filament bending . Using an in vitro assay to measure branching from curved sections of immobilized actin filaments , we observed preferential branch formation by the Arp2 / 3 complex on the convex face of the curved filament . To ex - plain this behavior , we propose a fluctuation gating model in which filament binding or branch nucleation by Arp2 / 3 occur only when a sufficiently large , transient , local curvature fluctuation causes a favorable conformational change in the filament , and we show with Monte Carlo simulations that this model can quantitatively account for our experimental data . We also show how the branch - ing bias can reinforce actin networks in response to compressive forces . These results demonstrate how filament curvature can alter the interaction of cytoskeletal filaments with regulatory proteins , suggesting that direct mechanotransduction by actin may serve as a general mechanism for organizing the cytoskeleton in response to force . actin - based motility ∣ autocatalytic branching ∣ bending fluctuations ∣ worm - like chain ∣ force sensing M echanical forces from a metazoan cell ’ s environment are transduced into biochemical signals during many biological processes , such as the differentiation , proliferation , and migra - tion of cells , to regulate processes ranging from cytoskeletal remodeling to gene expression ( 1 ) . Mechanotransduction has been thought to occur primarily via specialized mechanosensing molecules , which stretch or unfold in response to applied forces ( 2 , 3 ) , whereas the filament networks that make up the bulk of the cytoskeleton have been studied primarily as materials , whose me - chanical properties determine how they transmit or absorb forces ( 4 , 5 ) . We asked whether filamentous actin ( F - actin ) , a major part of the cytoskeleton , can act as a mechanosensor in its own right . The actin cytoskeleton consists of an organized network of filaments that bear both tensile and compressive forces and largely determine the shape and rigidity of metazoan cells ( 4 ) . Growth of one specialized cytoskeletal structure , the branched actin network ( 6 – 8 ) , produces forces that act on cellular membranes to help them protrude or change shape ( 9 – 12 ) and plays an important role in cell motility , the trafficking of cellular membranes including endo - cytosis , and the motility of intracellular pathogens ( 13 , 14 ) . When this protrusive growth is opposed by resistance from the surround - ing cytoskeleton or plasma membrane , the actin network com - presses , and filaments in the network bend ( 15 – 18 ) . In vitro studies have shown that compressive forces applied to branched networks cannot only reversibly deform them ( 15 ) but can also alter their density ( 19 ) and growth velocity ( 10 , 11 ) , suggesting that their architecture may respond actively to mechanical forces . Although the binding of many actin binding proteins ( ABPs ) to the side of an actin filament has been characterized ( 20 ) and , in some cases , shown to depend on the filament ’ s twist ( 21 , 22 ) or its bound nu - cleotide ( 23 , 24 ) , the response of most F - actin – ABP interactions to filament bending is unknown ( 5 ) . The only such response that has been documented is an increased frequency of severing by acto - phorin or its homolog actin depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) / cofilin at highly curved sections of actin filaments ( 23 , 25 ) . Bending of F - actin is particularly relevant to its interaction with the actin - related protein ( Arp ) 2 / 3 complex because of the complex ’ s central regulatory and structural roles in the formation of branched actin networks ( 6 ) . Upon activation by two molecules of nucleation - promoting factor ( NPF ) localized at or near a membrane , the Arp2 / 3 complex nucleates a new , “ daughter ” fila - ment from the side of a preexisting “ mother ” filament , forming a Y - shaped branch that serves as the basic structural unit of these networks ( 26 – 28 ) ( Fig . S1 ) . Importantly , the Arp2 / 3 binding site on F - actin spans three actin monomers along F - actin ’ s long - pitch helix , suggesting that its binding may be affected by changes in both monomer conformation and intermonomer distance induced by bending stresses ( 29 ) . The mechanism of Arp2 / 3 branch nucleation ( Fig . S1 ) is understood to involve conformational changes in the Arp2 / 3 complex induced by the binding of NPFs ( 26 , 27 , 28 , 30 , 31 ) . Ad - ditional conformational changes in both the Arp2 / 3 complex and several monomers in the mother filament probably occur upon the binding of the ternary complex of NPFs , Arp2 / 3 , and G - actin to the mother filament or during a subsequent activation step that is necessary to allow branch nucleation ( 26 , 31 ) , because the bound NPFs appear to partially overlap the F - actin binding sur - face of the Arp2 / 3 complex ( 32 ) . Once formed , the branch can then survive for minutes in vitro before dissociating ( a process called “ debranching ” ) ( 33 ) . The rate of debranching has been shown to depend on the nucleotide bound to the mother filament ( ATP , ADP - P i or ADP ) ( 33 ) , and on the presence of the actin stabilizing drug phalloidin ( 34 , 35 ) . Branch nucleation appears to happen most readily on actin in the ATP - bound state ( 36 ) , although it is not yet fully determined whether this is due to enhanced nucleation or stability against fast debranching . Experi - ments that used saturating amounts of phosphate to stabilize actin in the ADP - P i - bound state showed a rate of barbed end creation similar to that on unstabilized actin ( 33 ) . The regulation of both branch nucleation and branch stability by direct mechan - ical factors has not yet been studied . We asked whether filament Author contributions : V . I . R . , O . C . , P .

Results and Discussion Surface - Based Branching Assay Reveals That Actin Filament Curvature Biases Branching Direction . To examine whether and how the bend - ing of filaments affects their interaction with the Arp2 / 3 complex , we imaged branch nucleation from fluorescently labeled F - actin that was preimmobilized on a surface before incubation with Arp2 / 3 complex , an NPF , and monomeric actin ( G - actin ) ( Fig . 1 A – C ) . From the total of 403 images ( Fig . 1 D ) acquired in five indepen - dent experiments , we measured the distribution of curvature along the immobilized mother filaments ( 37 ) ( Fig . 1 E – H ) . Curvature varied smoothly as observed by fluorescence microscopy and could be measured on filaments spanning at least 3 μ m , with a spatial resolution of approximately 1 . 1 μ m . We were able to infer the location of Arp2 / 3 complex binding on the mother filament , with a spatial resolution of approximately 500 nm , from the location and direction of the short and stiff actin branches it nucleated , which were imaged separately from mother filaments using a two - color fluorescent labeling strategy ( 34 , 36 ) . Filament curvature at branch points and the direction of branch growth ( Fig . 1 C ) deter - mined the sign of the curvature value assigned to each branch . Branches on the convex side of the filament curve were assigned negative curvature , and branches on the concave side were as - signed positive curvature . Interestingly , we observed that branches were more likely to be found on the convex surface of a curved filament than on the concave surface . We compared the distribution of curvatures measured at equally spaced points 182 - nm apart along a total of 27 . 4 mm of mother filaments where branches could have formed ( Fig . 2 A ) , to the distribution of curvatures observed at 10 , 443 branch points , where branches actually formed ( Fig . 2 B ) . If branch density were independent of mother filament curvature , the two distributions would be identical after normalization . Instead , we found that the distributions were different ( Fig . 2 C and Table S1 ) and calculated their ratio , which we call the relative branch density ( Fig . 2 D ) . The relative branch density increased with negative curvature , indicating that extensional strain on the Arp2 / 3 - binding surface of F - actin makes branch nucleation more likely , whereas com - pressional strain makes it less likely ( Fig . 2 D ) . We quantified the trend with a weighted least - squares linear fit to the relative branch density calculated from a subset of mother filament curvature samples selected randomly , one per filament to strictly satisfy the assumptions underlying linear regression . The weights were the number of samples of mother filament curvature in each curvature bin . The relative linear branch density decreased with a slope of − 33 % per μ m − 1 of curvature [ 95 % C . I . : ( − 40 , − 26 % ) , R 2 ¼ 0 . 56 ] ( Fig . S2 A and Table S2 ) . Thus , the probability of find - ing a branch on the convex side of a filament with a curvature of 1 μ m − 1 is 99 % higher than finding it on the concave side . Linear regression against the full dataset containing multiple curvature measurements from each mother filament yielded similar results ( Table S2 ) . To quantify the effect of filament bending on total linear branch density , we carried out the same analysis as above with unsigned branch curvatures ( Fig . 2 E and F ) and found that the likelihood of branching per unit length shows a weak depen - dence on curvature ( Fig . 2 G and H and Fig . S2 B ) with a slope of 13 % per μ m − 1 [ 95 % CI : ( 3 . 3 , 23 % ) ] . However , the linear fit does not describe the unsigned curvature data very well ( Fig . S2 B and Table S2 , R 2 ¼ 0 . 17 ) , and the size of the deviation from a flat curve is comparable to the size of systematic errors in digital cur - 0 0 . 24 0 . 48 0 . 73 0 . 97 κ ( µ m - 1 ) θ φ * * * * * * * * * * * * * C D E F G H B A Fig . 1 .

S2 D , and SI Materials and Methods ) . In addition , fitting the data with a higher - order polynomial did not significantly improve the fit ( p ¼ 0 . 06 , ANOVA ) . We conclude that total linear branch density depends weakly on absolute curvature , and we focus on studying the predominant effect of mother filament curvature on branch direction . To confirm that the existence of a branching bias due to curva - ture was robust to the analysis method , we applied an alternative spline - based curvature estimation algorithm ( 37 , 38 ) ( Fig . S3 ) . The exact value of the slope depended on the curvature estimation method , but the observation of branch direction bias due to cur - vature [ − 14 % per μ m − 1 of curvature , 95 % C . I . : ( − 17 , − 10 % ) ] was unchanged ( Table S2 ) . We also checked how our estimate of bias in the direction of branching was affected by changes in image magnification and found only a weak effect ( Fig . S4 and Table S3 , p ¼ 0 . 076 ) . As biochemical controls , we verified that our results do not depend on the mode of actin labeling ( Fig . S5 A , C , and E , and Table S3 ) ( p ¼ 0 . 69 ) . We also tested whether stabilizing the mother filament in the ADP - P i - bound state by adding 25 mM phosphate affected the observed branching bias and did not ob - serve an effect ( Fig . S5 C – E and Table S3 ) ( p ¼ 0 . 998 ) , nor did we observe a significant change in slope due to phalloidin stabiliza - tion of F - actin ( Fig . S5 A , B , and E , and Table S3 ) ( p ¼ 0 . 10 ) . The Observed Bias in Branch Direction Is Not Caused by Debranching . Mother filament curvature may influence one or several of the steps in the branch nucleation pathway . Because we imaged the end products of this branching pathway , we could not address the effect of mother filament curvature on Arp2 / 3 binding separately from branch nucleation . To address the role of debranching , we incubated samples in which branching had occurred for 2 min for an additional 33 min in the absence of Arp2 / 3 complex . We did not observe debranching during the additional incubation time ( Fig . 3 A ) , even with a high concentration of blocking protein ( 2 mg ∕ mL BSA ) included in solution to prevent nonspecific adsorption of branches onto the coverslip surface . To quantify branch density and its dependence on curvature , we incubated different samples for either 50 s or 15 min before stabilization with phalloidin . In these experiments , the branch density de - creased , but not to a statistically significant extent ( Fig . 3 B ) , and there was not a statistically significant difference in the slope of the relative branch density as a function of curvature ( Fig . 3 C and Table S3 ) . These results indicate that mother filament curvature primarily acts on branch nucleation . It is also possible that curvature acts on the stability of very short branches that were proposed by Mahaffy and Pollard to dissociate before microscopy - based methods can detect them ( 33 ) . However , the lack of dependence on phosphate added at a concentration similar to that used by Mahaffy and Pollard sug - gests that curvature most likely acts on nucleation rather than dissociation . Overall , we do not exclude the possibility that cur - vature may affect fast debranching that we do not detect , but we favor the interpretation that curvature primarily affects branch nucleation . Itchetovkin et al . observed an enhanced branch den - sity on filaments stabilized in the ATP - bound state ( 36 ) , suggest - ing that the presence of ATP may have an effect on the nucleation process and may also affect sensitivity to curvature . However in our experiments , freshly polymerized actin containing ATP was only present on filament ends , where curvature could not be accurately measured . Monte Carlo Simulations Revealed the Nanometer - Scale Curvature Fluctuations of Constrained Filaments . Because the length scale re - levant to Arp2 / 3 binding and branch nucleation is 5 – 10 nm , well below the length scale at which fluorescence microscopy can measure curvature and also below the micrometer length scale at which curvature can be externally imposed , we used Monte Carlo simulations of a discretized worm - like chain ( WLC ) polymer ( Fig . S6 A and B , and SI Materials and Methods ) to assess the nanometer - scale implications of the micrometer - scale curvature . The validity of the WLC model to F - actin elasticity has been demonstrated for filament curvatures as high as 5 μ m − 1 ( 39 ) . In our work , the WLC polymer , with the persistence length of actin ( L p ¼ 9 μ m ) ( 40 ) , was pinned to a plane with imposed curvature , κ 0 , mimicking the experiment ( Fig . 4 A ) . Despite being constrained to an average curvature of κ 0 , the simulated filament exhibits large thermal fluctuations in nan - ometer - length - scale local curvature about that average ( Fig . 4 A and B , and Fig . S6 E ) . The breadth of the local curvature distribu - tion is large in comparison to the range of experimentally acces - sible imposed curvatures . Therefore , for the side of a filament with convex average curvature of − 1 μ m − 1 , locally concave fluctuations occur almost as often as locally convex ones ( Fig . S6 C – E ) . This small , 10 % asymmetry is inconsistent with the larger , 99 % asym - metry in branch density we observed between the two sides of filaments with − 1 μ m − 1 average curvature ( Fig . 2 D and Fig . S2 A ) . Strong differences between the sides of the filament with convex and concave average curvature only occur in the extreme tails of the corresponding curvature distributions . Therefore , we conclude that branching must be sensitive to local curvature fluctuations that are far from the average . In addition , because such extreme local curvature fluctuations occur rarely , making the system slow to reach chemical equilibrium , we discuss the effect of curvature on branch nucleation by Arp2 / 3 in kinetic terms . A Fluctuation Gating Model for Branching by the Arp2 / 3 Complex Is Consistent with the Experimental Data . Two lines of evidence sup - port the hypothesis that curvature regulates branch nucleation kinetics . First , the Arp2 / 3 complex binds F - actin in solution with a slow on - rate , perhaps because it must wait for a favorable struc - tural fluctuation of the filament ( 31 ) . Second , a structural model of the Arp2 / 3 - actin branch shows a local distortion involving subdomain 2 of an actin monomer at the Arp2 / 3 binding site ( 29 ) . Extensional strain could weaken longitudinal intermonomer contacts in F - actin , helping to stabilize a transition state with 3 min 33 min ∆ relative branchdensity ( % / µ m - 1 ) Branchdensity ( branches / µ m ) 0 . 83 15 Debranching time ( min ) A B C 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 - 30 - 20 - 10 0 Fig . 3 . Branch stability does not affect the branching bias .

Based on this evidence , we developed a filament fluctuation gating model , conceptually similar to fluctuation - gated binding of ligands to proteins ( 41 ) . In our model , stable Arp2 / 3 ternary complex binding and branch nucleation occur only when the local curvature of the filament fluctuates beyond a threshold value κ th ( Fig . 4 C ) . A sharp threshold is chosen because in the extreme wings of the local curvature distribution , probability attenuates so rapidly that the only pertinent model parameter is the lowest curvature value where branching is greatly enhanced , in effect , κ th . Thus , the probability that a branch forms on either side of the curved filament under our model is the net probability of respec - tive curvature values in excess of þ κ th or − κ th ( Fig . 4 B and C ) . Our calculations assess how extreme this curvature threshold needs to be in order to account for the curvature preference we observe experimentally . With these simple assumptions , the fluctuation gating model captures the shape of the curvature - dependent branching bias and agrees quantitatively with our data over the entire experi - mental range for a value of κ th ¼ 5 μ m − 1 ( red curve , Figs . 2 D and 4 D ) . These results are consistent with a mechanism in which F - actin bending fluctuations play a role in regulating branch for - mation by the Arp2 / 3 complex , suggesting that branching can be regulated by alterations of bending fluctuations of filaments due to constraints on actin network architecture or by binding of other ABPs . However , because of its coarse - grained resolution , this model cannot make predictions about conformational changes of the actin monomer caused by bending in the Arp2 / 3 binding site on the scale of individual amino acid residues . This model is presented in the simplest form that is consistent with our data and experimental parameters , but it could be extended to include details about the dependence of branch direction on curvature based on future findings . For example , we currently have little data in the very high convex curvature regime , where the branch density may decrease as the curvature distorts the mother fila - ment to such an extent that it can no longer accommodate branch nucleation . Autocatalytic Branching Amplifies the Branching Bias . Directionally biased branching has important implications for branched actin assembly in vivo , where autocatalytic nucleation amplifies small effects ( 26 , 42 ) . A large fraction of filaments in a branched actin network adopt an approximately − 35 ° orientation ( 43 ) , and the side of a bent filament experiencing extensional strain is the same side that typically faces the bending force . Excess growth on the convex side of the curved filament would therefore create more branches oriented toward the bending force , reinforcing the branched network ( Fig . 5 A ) . The excess of branches on the most convex side of the mother filament may also define a preferred plane for branching that coincides with the plane of filament cur - vature , possibly contributing to the flat and thin shape of lamelli - podia . It would also lead to more filaments growing into the membrane - adjacent zone where new branches can be nucleated , increasing total branch density . We studied this effect with a differ - ent , stochastic simulation of branching in two dimensions ( Fig . 5 B ) and found that , for a 15 % bias toward the membrane , the total number of filaments is double that of the zero bias case after only 10 branch generations ( Fig . 5 B ) . Based on our experimental data ( Fig . 2 D ) , a 15 % curvature bias corresponds to a radius of curva - ture of 2 . 3 μ m and a bending energy of 0 . 6 k B T per μ m of ATP - bound filament ( 40 ) .

If the length of free F - actin is longer at the leading edge ( 48 , 49 ) , the filaments require even less force to bend . Therefore , even modest filament curvature that is caused by the normal force balance of branched actin growth against a membrane can generate a significant bias in the direction of actin branch nucleation . Conclusions We have shown that F - actin curvature regulates Arp2 / 3 complex activity , providing the cell with a distributed , filament - dependent mechanism for sensing and responding to the compressive stress on branched actin networks . Our results suggest the possibility that mechanical stress on cytoskeletal filaments can modulate how they interact with their binding partners . The actin filament takes on a diversity of structural states as it grows , interacts with binding proteins , encounters physical constraints , and fluctuates due to thermal motion ( 50 , 51 ) . It is likely that other side - binding ABPs besides the Arp2 / 3 complex exhibit similar sensitivity to local actin curvature , providing a direct mechanism for altering organization of the actin cytoskeleton in response to force . For ex - ample , filament severing by the ADF / cofilin homolog actophorin occurs more readily at points of high curvature ( 23 ) , consistent with a recently elucidated mechanism for severing by cofilin that depends on a mechanism that takes advantage of the mechanical instability at the border between two structural states of F - actin ( 25 ) . However , it is not yet known whether cofilin binding or the cooperativity of cofilin binding is affected by local filament curva - ture , although it has been shown that its binding lowers the per - sistence length of actin ( 52 ) and that its binding is enhanced by tension on F - actin ( 53 ) . Nor have other proteins that modify the persistence length of actin , such as drebrin ( 54 ) or tropomyosin ( 40 ) , been tested for sensitivity to F - actin curvature . The methods we have developed can be used as a platform to investigate the curvature dependence of other ABP – filament interactions and the role of actin filament bending in mechanotransduction and cytos - keletal reorganization .

A flow channel was assembled with a plasma - cleaned ( ca . 300 mTorr oxygen ; Plasmod ; March Instruments ) coverslip and incubated with 10 mg ∕ mL biotinylated BSA ( A6043 ; Sigma - Aldrich ) in 80 mM pipera - zine - N - N ′ - bis ( 2 - ethanesulfonic acid ) pH 6 . 9 , 1 mM EGTA , and 4 mM MgCl 2 for 180 min at 4°C , and 0 . 2 mg ∕ mL streptavidin ( S4762 ; Sigma - Aldrich ) in 1 × calcium and magnesium free PBS ( Cellgro ; Mediatech ) for 30 – 60 min at 23°C . The channel was washed with buffer composed of nine parts G buffer ( 5 mM Tris , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 5 mM DTT , 1 mM NaN 3 , pH 8 . 0 at 4°C ) and one parteither10 × KMEI buffer ( 500mMKCl , 10mMMgCl 2 , 10mM EGTA , 100 mM imidazole , pH 7 . 0 ) or 10 × PKMEI buffer ( 92 mM KH 2 PO 4 , 158mM K 2 HPO 4 , 92mMKCl , 10mMMgCl 2 , 10mMEGTA , 100mM imidazole , pH7 . 0 ) . Inbothcases , thefinalpHwas7 . 0at23°C . Werefertothecompound buffers as KMEI and PKMEI , respectively . F - actin ( 10 – 20 % biotinylated and 30 % AF546 - labeled ) was polymerized 1 h at 23°C in KMEI or PKMEI and 0 . 5 mM ATP ( Roche Applied Science ) . F - actin ( 50 nM ) and 1 μ M of G - actin containing similar ratios of unlabeled , biotinylated , and AF546 - or Cy3 - labeled monomers was incubated in the channel for 5 min . We estimated that approximately 10 % of biotin moieties on a filament bind streptavidin and thus the spacing between surface attach - ment points was 140 – 270 nm . The channel was washed with KMEI or PKMEI and incubated with branching mix containing 0 . 5 mM ATP , 100 nM of the N - terminal WCA domain of neural Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein , 100 nM Arp2 / 3 complex , 2 mg ∕ mL BSA ( A0281 ; Sigma - Aldrich ) , and 0 . 6 – 1 uM actin ( 50 % AF488 labeled ) , for 70 – 120 s at 23°C . The concentrations and incuba - tion times were chosen such that individual branches were sparse enough to be individually identified . Finally , the channel was washed with KMEI or PKMEI containing 1 μ M phalloidin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) and in the case of cysteine - labeled mother filaments , an oxygen scavenger system consisting of 250 μ g ∕ mL glucose oxidase ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , 4 . 5 mg ∕ mL glucose , and 30 μ g ∕ mL catalase ( Roche Applied Science ) . Modified branching assays for measuring the effect of phalloidin and for measuring branch stability as a function of curvature are described in SI Materials and Methods . Curvature Estimation , Tangent Angle Method . We estimated filament curva - ture from skeletonized digital filament images ( Fig . 1 E – H ) by implementing the tangent angle - based method ( method II ) described previously ( 37 ) with MATLAB ( The Mathworks ) using a Gaussian differentiating kernel with σ ¼ 3 pixels and a filter size of m ¼ 9 pixels , chosen empirically by estimating the curvature of digital circles of known radius . The accuracy of this and similar local methods , compared to other curvature estimation strategies such as the global spline fit method ( SI Materials and Methods ) , has been previously de - monstrated ( 37 , 38 ) . Curvature error as evaluated using the tangent angle method was 0 . 08 μ m − 1 , which is less than the bin width we used for histo - grams . End effects made curvature unreliable m points in from each end , so these end segments and any branches growing on them were excluded from further analysis . The resulting curves were sampled in two ways . First , to maximize the number of data points collected , curvature was measured every 1 . 1 pixels ( 182 nm ) , accepting the fact that curvature is correlated be - tween nearby points on the same filament . Secondly , to remove any potential correlationsbetweenthecurvaturevaluessampledandthussatisfytheassump - tions of the Kolmogorov – Smirnov test and weighted linear regression proce - dures , one point was randomly chosen on each filament , in a region away from the ends , and its curvature was measured in an identical way . Both cur - vature samples were used to create histograms of the curvature distribution of mother filaments for each experiment , which were normalized to sum to one . Branch Analysis . Branches were manually identified using two criteria : ( i ) overlap between one end of the green branch and the red mother filament , and ( ii ) lack of collinearity with the end of any other filament . Long branches that had one blurred end due to thermal fluctuations over the 1 - to 1 . 5 - s exposure were counted if their blurred end pointed away from the mother filament . Branch points were assigned the average curvature of the three closest pixels on the nearest mother filament skeleton ; any branch point morethanthreepixelsaway fromaskeletonwasignored . Branchorientation was determined by taking the cross - product of the branch vector and the tangent vector to the mother filament curve , which was calculated by smoothing the digitized tangent vectors to the same curve with a Gaussian filter ( 37 ) in the tangent angle - based analysis , or from the cubic spline in the spline - based analysis . Branches with indeterminate direction were assigned the absolute value of curvature and only used in the analysis of total linear branch density . Histogram bins with zero branches or curvature measure - ments were ignored . Calculation of Relative Branch Density . Controls with randomly located and oriented simulated branches were created for each image to quantify the artifacts of digital curvature estimation . They were analyzed in parallel with real data to create control histograms for each dataset . The linear branch density as a function of curvature was calculated by taking a ratio of the branch curvature histogram to the mother filament curvature histogram . The control density was subtracted from the real density to remove digitiza - tion artifacts ( Fig . S2 C and D ) . We quantified the trend with a least - squares linear fit to the relative branch density ( Fig . S2 A and B ) weighted by the number of samples of mother filament curvature in each curvature bin . Statistical calculations are described in SI Materials and Methods . The branching bias we observe is most likely an underestimate of the true directional bias because our experiment averages over branches growing horizontally along the plane of the surface , where bending strain is highest ( θ ¼ 0 ° or 180° in Fig . 1 B ) and those growing at other angles , because the fluorescence images are 2D projections of 3D branches ( Fig . 1 B and C ) . Large - amplitude bending of mother filaments in three dimensions was not observed except at untethered ends , due to the stiffness of F - actin ( 40 ) , but small - amplitude , out - of - plane local curvature fluctuations over length scales of nanometers were underestimated by construction in simulations because curvature in experiments was also measured in projection ( see SI Materials and Methods ) . Stochastic Model of Bias Propagation During Branching . To quantify how the directional branching bias is amplified by branched actin growth , we created a simple 2D model in which actin filaments are represented as rigid rods of constantlength , correspondingtotheaveragefilamentlengththat cangrow before capping occurs , and growing at # 36 ° and # 108 ° relative to the direc - tionofnetworkgrowth . Startingwith30filamentsateachofthefourangles , the filaments were allowed to grow two branches , each pointing either away from or toward the direction of network growth , for 30 generations .

Each branch had a 0 . 5 þ b probability of growing into the branching zone ( and toward the direction of growth ) and a 0 . 5 − b probability of growing out of the branching zone ( and away from the direction of growth ) , where 2 b is the directional branch - ing bias .
