SUMMARY Bin - Amphiphysin - Rvs ( BAR ) domain proteins are central regulators of many cellular processes involving membrane dynamics . BAR domains sculpt phosphoinositide - rich membranes to generate mem - brane protrusions or invaginations . Here , we report that , in addition to regulating membrane geometry , BAR domains can generate extremely stable lipid microdomains by ‘‘freezing’’ phosphoinositide dy - namics . This is a general feature of BAR domains , because the yeast endocytic BAR and Fes / CIP4 homology BAR ( F - BAR ) domains , the inverse BAR domain of Pinkbar , and the eisosomal BAR protein Lsp1 induced phosphoinositide clustering and halted lipid diffusion , despite differences in mechanisms of membrane interactions . Lsp1 displays comparable low diffusion rates in vitro and in vivo , suggesting that BAR domain proteins also generate stable phos - phoinositide microdomains in cells . These results uncover a conserved role for BAR superfamily pro - teins in regulating lipid dynamics within membranes . Stable microdomains induced by BAR domain scaffolds and speciﬁc lipids can generate phase boundaries and diffusion barriers , which may have profound impacts on diverse cellular processes . INTRODUCTION Cellular processes , such as endocytosis , cell migration , and morphogenesis , require precise regulation of plasma membrane shape and dynamics . In addition to actin polymerization , which produces forces for generation of plasma membrane protrusions and invaginations , these processes rely on proteins that bind directly to membranes to sense membrane curvature and sculpt them into desired shapes ( Graham and Kozlov , 2010 ; McMahon and Gallop , 2005 ; Antonny , 2011 ) . Among the central mem - brane - sculpting proteins are the members of the Bin - Amphiphy - sin - Rvs ( BAR ) domain superfamily . The BAR domain is a dimeric a - helical protein motif , which interacts with membranes through a curved interface . Furthermore , the BAR domains can oligomer - ize into helical scaffolds to further promote membrane deforma - tion ( Frost et al . , 2008 ; Mim et al . , 2012 ; Peter et al . , 2004 ; Shimada et al . , 2007 ; Takei et al . , 1999 ) . Depending on the geometry of the lipid - binding interface and oligomerization prop - erties of the domain , BAR superfamily domains can generate either positive ( BAR and most Fes / CIP4 homology BAR [ F - BAR ] domains ) or negative membrane curvature ( most in - verse BAR [ I - BAR ] domains ) as well as stabilize planar mem - brane sheets ( the I - BAR domain of Pinkbar ; Frost et al . , 2009 ; Py - ka¨la¨inen et al . , 2011 ; Suetsugu et al . , 2010 ; Zhao et al . , 2011 ) . In addition to electrostatic interactions with lipid head groups , a subset of canonical BAR domains ( N - terminal BAR [ N - BAR ] do - mains ) and certain I - BAR domains can insert amphipathic a he - lices into the lipid bilayer . In N - BAR domain - induced membrane tubules , the N - terminal amphipathic a helices provide important interdomain contacts to stabilize the N - BAR scaffolds ( Mim et al . , 2012 ) . The membrane - inserting a helices of BAR domains have also been reported to drive membrane scission , regulate the diameter of membrane tubules , and sense positive mem - brane curvature ( Bhatia et al . , 2009 ; Boucrot et al . , 2012 ; Gallop et al . , 2006 ; Masuda et al . , 2006 ; Saarikangas et al . , 2009 ) . Formation of plasma membrane invaginations during endo - cytosis is a complex process that requires both the actin poly - merization machinery and generation of positive membrane curvature by BAR and F - BAR domain proteins ( Collins et al . , 2011 ; Kukulski et al . , 2012 ; Qualmann et al . , 2011 ) . In budding yeast , two F - BAR domain proteins , Syp1 and Bzz1 , and a heter - odimeric BAR domain protein , Rvs161 / 167 , contribute to endo - cytosis . These three membrane - sculpting proteins are recruited to the endocytic sites with distinct timing . Syp1 is among the ﬁrst proteins to arrive , but it departs from the endocytic site before formation of a deep membrane invagination and scission , which Cell Reports 4 , 1213 – 1223 , September 26 , 2013 ª 2013 The Authors 1213 coincide with the arrival of Bzz1 and Rvs161 / 167 at the site ( Weinberg and Drubin , 2012 ) . Bzz1 , acting at the invagination base , stabilizes endocytic sites and functions with Rvs161 / 167 , localized along the tubule , to achieve proper endocytic mem - brane geometry necessary for efﬁcient scission ( Kishimoto et al . , 2011 ) . However , the biochemical differences between various BAR and F - BAR domains that may underlie their sequen - tial recruitment and speciﬁc functions in endocytic patches are not known . A recent study revealed that mammalian I - BAR domains and the BAR domain of amphiphysin can induce the clustering of phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) ( Saarikangas et al . , 2009 ) . Furthermore , theoretical work proposed that mem - brane - scission during endocytosis in budding yeast may result from a lipid - phase boundary induced by PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 clustering via BAR domains at the neck of endocytic invagination ( Liu et al . , 2009 ) . However , whether the BAR domain scaffolds can limit the lateral mobility of lipids in membranes to generate stable lipid - phase boundaries and diffusion barriers has not been re - ported . Here , we revealed that BAR domains assemble into sta - ble scaffolds , which not only bend membranes but also inhibit the lateral diffusion of phosphoinositide molecules by at least two orders of magnitude . Generation of extremely stable pro - tein - lipid microdomains appears to be a general feature of BAR superfamily proteins , because all membrane - tubulating BAR and F - BAR domains tested here , as well as the BAR domain of Pinkbar , which stabilizes planar membrane sheets , efﬁciently halted phosphoinositide diffusion . Our results suggest that BAR domain scaffolds form lipid diffusion barriers and phase bound - aries , which are likely to have profound importance in a wide va - riety of cellular processes . RESULTS Yeast Endocytic BAR and F - BAR Domains Are Biochemically Distinct To examine the general biochemical properties of the BAR / F - BAR domains of budding yeast endocytic proteins Syp1 , Bzz1 , and Rvs161 / 167 and to reveal their possible differences , these domains were produced as nontagged versions and as GFP / mCherry - fusion proteins in E . coli . As reported previously , the puriﬁed F - BAR domain of Syp1 and BAR domain of Rvs161 / 167 ( Reider et al . , 2009 ; Youn et al . , 2010 ) , as well as the pre - viously uncharacterized F - BAR domain of Bzz1 , induced tubulation of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - containing vesicles . Based on electron microscopy analysis , the diameters of membrane tubules gener - ated by the three domains were similar to each other ( 20 nm ± 2 . 5 nm ; Figure S1A ) . However , time - lapse imaging of giant unila - mellar vesicles ( GUVs ) in the presence of the protein domains suggested that the heterodimeric Rvs161 / 167 BAR domain is slightly more efﬁcient in tubulating membranes compared to the two endocytic F - BAR domains ( Figures S1B and S1C ) . Furthermore , slightly higher concentration of Syp1 F - BAR domain ( (cid:1) 1 m M ) was required for efﬁcient membrane tubulation compared to Rvs161 / 167 BAR domain and Bzz1 F - BAR domain ( (cid:1) 0 . 5 m M ) ( data not shown ) . Interestingly , these domains displayed prominent differences in their lipid speciﬁcities ( Figures 1A and S2 ) . Based on vesicle cosedimentation assays , interaction of the Rvs161 / 167 BAR domain with vesicles was strongly enhanced by PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , whereas the membrane - binding of Bzz1 F - BAR domain was not augmented by high PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 density of the membranes , and the membrane binding of the Syp1 F - BAR domain was slightly inhibited at high ( > 8 % ) PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 density ( Figure 1A ) . Because a large fraction of Bzz1 F - BAR domain sedimented , even in the absence of vesicles , its lipid speciﬁcity was also examined by tryptophan ﬂuorescence assay , which provided very similar results to the cosedimentation assay ( Figure S2D ) . Possible speciﬁcity of the Rvs161 / 167 BAR domain toward certain phosphoinositides was further examined by a vesicle cosedimentation assay . The data revealed that this domain binds to vesicles containing 10 % phosphoinositides with an af - ﬁnity of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 > PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 > PI3P ( Figures S2E and S2F ) . Consistent with the biochemical data , time - lapse imaging of GUVs incubated simultaneously with Syp1 F - BAR and Rvs161 / 167 BAR domains revealed that , although the two domains can initially colocalize on membrane microdomains and tubules ( arrows in Figure 1B ) , the Rvs161 / 167 BAR domain efﬁciently re - places the Syp1 F - BAR domain from the surface of the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - containing vesicles within 1 to 2 min ( Figures 1B and 1C ) . Furthermore , a vesicle cosedimentation experiment demon - strated that the Rvs161 / 167 BAR domain and Syp1 F - BAR domain compete with each other for membrane binding ( Fig - ure S1D ) . Therefore , similar to the situation at the endocytic sites , Rvs161 / 167 can replace Syp1 on membrane tubules . In addition to their distinct lipid speciﬁcities , the three do - mains displayed different effects on membrane properties , including membrane ﬂuidity and phospholipid order as detected by diphenylhexatriene ( DPH ) anisotropy and Laurdan general - ized polarization , respectively ( Parasassi et al . , 1990 ; Zaritsky et al . , 1985 ) . The BAR domain of Rvs161 / 167 increased the DPH anisotropy , suggesting that it may interact with the acyl - chain region of the lipid bilayer ( Figure S3A ) . In addition , Laurdan generalized polarization was increased , indicating augmented lipid packing in the interfacial region of membranes ( Figure S3C ) , which can be caused by both protein insertion and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 clustering . Interestingly , these effects were diminished when the N - terminal helix of the BAR domain was deleted or the amphipathic nature of the helix was disrupted ( Figures S3B and S3D ; data not shown ) , suggesting that the N - terminal helix is important for causing the changes of these membrane phys - iochemical properties . Furthermore , mutations in the N - terminal helix diminished the afﬁnity of the Rvs161 / 167 BAR domain to phosphoinositide - rich membrane by (cid:1) 10 - fold ( Figure S2F ) . Importantly , changes of tryptophan ( Trp3 of Rvs161 ) spectra ( Figure S4A ) and quenching of Trp3 by lipids brominated along the acyl - chains ( Figure S4B ) provided strong evidence that the N - terminal a helix of Rvs161 indeed inserts into the hydrophobic core region of the lipid bilayer . The effects of the Rvs161 / 167 BAR domain on membrane ﬂuidity and lipid order are dependent on lipid composition . The BAR domain of Rvs161 / 167 affect the membrane ﬂuidity and lipid order only in the presence of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in the membrane ( Figures S3E and S3F ) , further indicating that proper membrane inter - action of the Rvs161 / 167 BAR domain is dependent on the phosphoinositide . 1214 Cell Reports 4 , 1213 – 1223 , September 26 , 2013 ª 2013 The Authors Figure 1 . Yeast Endocytic BAR / F - BAR Domains Display Differences in Their Lipid Speciﬁcities ( A ) The F - BAR / BAR domains of Syp1 , Bzz1 , and Rvs161 / 167 display different PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 speciﬁcities , as measured by a vesicle cosedimentation assay . The membrane binding of Syp1 F - BAR domain was slightly inhibited at high ( > 8 % ) PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 density . In contrast , interaction of the BAR domain of Rvs161 / 167 with vesicles was signiﬁcantly enhanced by PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , whereas the membrane binding of Bzz1 F - BAR domains was not augmented by high PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 density in the membranes . The data are from three independent experiments , and the error bar indicates ± SD . The dotted line ( control ) indicates the amount of protein sedimenting in the absence of lipids . ( B ) When added simultaneously on vesicles , the BAR / F - BAR domains of Rvs161 / 167 ( Rvs - Cherry ) and Syp1 ( Syp1 - GFP ) initially bind to GUVs and colocalize to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - richtubules ( indicated byarrows ) . However , theSyp1F - BARdomaindissociatesfromthemembranewithin1to2min , whereastheBARdomainofRvs 161 / 167 remains bound to the surface of GUVs . The scale bar represents 10 m m . ( C ) Quantiﬁcation of the relative ﬂuorescence intensities of the two domains on GUVs demonstrates that Rvs161 / 167 BAR domain replaces the Syp1 F - BAR domain from the membrane . Please note that the slight decrease in the Rvs161 / 167 mCherry ﬂuorescence most likely results from photobleaching during the monitoring period . The lipid composition was POPC : POPE : POPS : PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 = 50 : 20 : 20 : 10 . The concentration of the proteins was 1 m M . Cell Reports 4 , 1213 – 1223 , September 26 , 2013 ª 2013 The Authors 1215 In contrast , the F - BAR domains of Syp1 and Bzz1 did not have detectable effects on the acyl - chain region as measured by changes in DPH anisotropy and Laurdan generalized polariza - tion ( Figures S3A and S3C ) . However , the F - BAR domains of Syp1 and Bzz1 displayed strong membrane curvature - sensing activity ( Figure S5 ) . These results are in apparent contradiction with previous measurements , concluding that hydrophobic in - sertions are essential for sensing of membrane curvature in other BAR domains ( Bhatia et al . , 2009 ) . Thus , further studies are required to reveal the exact mechanism by which the F - BAR domains of Syp1 and Bzz1 sense membrane curvature . One possible explanation could be ‘‘protein crowding’’ , which was recently shown to induce membrane curvature ( Stachowiak et al . , 2012 ) and may also assist in curvature sensing . Alterna - tively , the F - BAR domains of Syp1 and Bzz1 may display very shallow insertion into the lipid bilayer , which would not be de - tected by DPH anisotropy and Laurdan generalized polarization methods . Together , these data demonstrate that the BAR and F - BAR domains of the three budding yeast endocytic proteins display signiﬁcant differences in their lipid speciﬁcities and in mecha - nisms of membrane interactions . These biochemical differences may at least partially account for the speciﬁc roles and recruit - ment timing of these proteins in endocytosis . Phosphoinositide Clustering Is a General Feature of BAR Superfamily Domains Mammalian I - BAR domains and the BAR domain of amphiphysin induce phosphoinositide clustering ( Saarikangas et al . , 2009 ) . To determine whether this is a general activity of all BAR superfamily domains , we examined the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - clustering activities of Syp1 , Bzz1 , and Rvs161 / 167 BAR / F - BAR domains by a ﬂuoro - metric assay and by time - lapse imaging of ﬂuorescently labeled lipids on GUVs . The F - BAR / BAR domains of Syp1 , Bzz1 , and Rvs161 / 167 promoted quenching of BODIPY - conjugated PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in a concentration - dependent manner , indicating that these domains induce phosphoinositide clustering at a nano - meter scale ( Figure 2A ) . Besides PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , the F - BAR / BAR domains of Syp1 , Bzz1 , and Rvs161 / 167 also cluster PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 and PI3P with an efﬁciency of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 > PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 > PI3P ( Figure 2B ) , suggesting that the phosphoinositide clustering is mainly mediated through electrostatic interactions . Figure 2 . Yeast Endocytic BAR / F - BAR Do - mains Promote PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 Clustering and Induce the Formation of Lipid Microdo - mains ( A ) PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 clustering examined at the nanometer scale by measuring the quenching of BODIPY - TMR - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . The F - BAR / BAR domains of Syp1 , Bzz1 , and Rvs161 / 167 promoted the quenching of BODIPY - conjugated PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in a concentration - dependent manner , indicating that they induce phosphoinositide clustering by bringing BODIPY - TMR - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 molecules in close proximity to each other . The lipid composition was POPC : POPE : POPS : PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 : bodipy - TMR - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 = 50 : 20 : 20 : 9 . 5 : 0 . 5 . All error bars indicate ± SD . ( B ) The F - BAR / BAR domains of Syp1 , Bzz1 , and Rvs161 / 167 clustered PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 , and PI3P with an efﬁciency of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 > PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 > PI3P . The lipid composition was POPC : POPE : POPS : BODIPY - phosphoinositide = 59 : 20 : 20 : 1 , and the lipid concentration was 40 m M . ( C ) The steady - state homo - FRET ﬂuorescence anisotropy of Rvs - Cherry decreased in the pres - ence of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - containing vesicles , suggesting that Rvs161 / 167 BAR domain self - assembled into oligomers in the presence of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . The con - centration of Rvs - Cherry was 0 . 5 m M . ( D ) Formation of lipid microdomains at micrometer scale revealed by light microscopy imaging of GUVs . The F - BAR / BAR domains of Syp1 , Bzz1 , and Rvs161 / 167 generated visible TopFluor - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 clusters on GUVs . However , the zwitter - ionic lipid phosphatidylethanolamine ( PE ) re - mained mostly uniformly distributed on the GUV membrane with some PE clustering to the membrane tubules . The lipid composition was POPC : POPE : POPS : PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 : TopFluor - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 : Rhodamine - PE = 50 : 19 : 20 : 9 : 1 : 1 . The ﬁnal con - centration of the Rvs161 / 167 BAR domain was 1 m M . All experiments were carried out at room temperature . The scale bar represents 10 m m . 1216 Cell Reports 4 , 1213 – 1223 , September 26 , 2013 ª 2013 The Authors Homo - ﬂuorescence resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) anisot - ropy experiments on the Rvs161 / 167 BAR domain suggested that individual BAR domain heterodimers assemble into oligo - mers on phosphoinositide - rich membranes ( Figure 2C ) , as pre - viously shown for mammalian BAR and F - BAR domains by cryoelectron microscopy ( Frost et al . , 2008 ; Mim et al . , 2012 ) . Therefore , this domain may also induce formation of larger phos - phoinositide clusters through self - assembly . In support of this possibility , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 clustering by the F - BAR / BAR domains of Syp1 , Bzz1 , and Rvs161 / 167 was also detected by ﬂuorescence microscopy ( Figure 2D ) . When the Rvs161 / 167 BAR domain was added to GUVs containing ﬂuorescently labeled lipids , the zwit - terionic lipid phosphatidylethanolamine ( PE ) remained mostly uniformly localized around the GUV membrane , whereas PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 formed visible clusters ( Figure 2D ) . Together , these data show that the BAR and F - BAR domains of yeast endocytic proteins induce PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 clustering , thus suggesting that phos - phoinositide clustering is a general property of all BAR superfam - ily domains . Generation of Extremely Stable PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 Microdomains by BAR Domains The plasma membrane of living cells is organized into speciﬁc heterogeneous domains with distinct protein and lipid composi - tions . However , the degree to which membrane - attached pro - teins can affect the lateral diffusion of lipids is poorly understood . For example , the possible effects of BAR domain proteins on lipid dynamics have not been reported . To examine whether BAR and F - BAR domains can signiﬁcantly affect PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 dy - namics in the membrane , we carried out ﬂuorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) analysis of GUVs in the presence of ﬂuorescently conjugated lipids and proteins . In the control vesicles , TopFluor - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 displayed fast recovery at the pho - tobleached region , consistent with rapid lateral diffusion of lipid molecules ( Figure 3A ) . Strikingly , both PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and the associ - ated proteins displayed extremely slow recovery in the mem - brane clusters and tubular regions induced by the BAR / F - BAR domains of Syp1 , Bzz1 , and Rvs161 / 167 ( Figures 3B and 3D ) . Furthermore , in the cases where only a segment of the mem - brane tubule was photobleached , the TopFuor - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 probe did not display redistribution within the tubule during the recov - ery period ( arrowheads in Figure 3B ) . These results provide evi - dence for an almost complete lack of lateral diffusion of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in the BAR domain - induced membrane tubules . To exclude the possibility that the diminished lateral diffusion of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in membrane tubules is caused by membrane curvature generated by these proteins , we measured the protein dynamics and lateral diffusion of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 on planar membranes induced by the BAR domain of Pinkbar ( Figures 3C and 3D ) . Similar to endocytic BAR and F - BAR domains , the BAR domain of Pinkbar and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 displayed very slow recovery on planar membranes , suggesting that severely reduced diffusion of phosphoinositides associated with the BAR domain scaffolds is not dependent on membrane curvature . It is , however , important to note that efﬁcient inhibition of lipid diffusion is dependent on protein density and oligomerization . This is because , at nontubular regions of the Rvs161 / 167 - , Bzz1 - , and Syp1 - containing vesicles , where the protein was pre - sumably not assembled into stable scaffolds , the lateral diffusion of lipids was only mildly affected ( Figures S6A and S6B ) . Further - more , a BAR domain mutant of Pinkbar ( W141S ) that is less efﬁ - cient in forming oligomers ( Pyka¨la¨inen et al . , 2011 ) displayed less pronounced effects on phosphoinositide dynamics ascompared to the wild - type BAR domain of Pinkbar ( Figure S6D ) . It is also important to note that , in the protein / PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 clusters , (cid:1) 15 % – 35 % of the lipid molecules displayed rapid diffusion ( Figures S6F and S6G ) . This rapidly recovering PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 population may correspond to those lipid molecules in the photobleached region that are not associated with BAR domain scaffolds . By excluding the rapidly recovering population , only extremely slow recovery of the remaining lipid molecules was detected at the photobleached region , suggesting that lateral diffusion of lipids in the BAR / F - BAR domain - induced membrane tubules is reduced by at least two orders of magnitude ( Figures 3D , S6F , and S6G ) . We next examined the effects of the Rvs161 / 167 BAR domain on the dynamics of other lipid species , which do not concentrate to BAR domain scaffolds . FRAP assays using nitrobenzoxadia - zole ( NBD ) head group - labeled PE revealed that the lateral diffu - sion of this zwitterionic lipid was also severely diminished in membrane clusters / tubules induced by the Rvs161 / 167 BAR domain , because (cid:1) 40 % of the ﬂuorescence did not recover during the monitoring period ( Figures 4A and 4B ) . In order to examine the possible effects of the relatively large artiﬁcial head group on the diffusion of NBD head group - labeled PE , we studied the dynamics of acyl chain - labeled PE and phospha - tidylcholine ( PC ) . Importantly , these acyl - chain - labeled lipids displayed only approximately 5 - fold decreased dynamics in the BAR domain clusters as compared to control vesicles , and unlike head group - labeled PE , they reached full ﬂuorescence re - covery during the 10 min monitoring period ( Figures 4C and S6E ) . Thus , although BAR domain scaffolds can efﬁciently inhibit the dynamics of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , they display signiﬁcantly smaller effects on the lateral diffusion of nonbound lipids . Collectively , these data demonstrate that the budding yeast endocytic BAR and F - BAR domains and the BAR domain of mouse Pinkbar can assemble into very stable scaffolds on mem - branes . By efﬁciently inhibiting the lateral diffusion of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , the BAR domain scaffolds can generate extremely stable lipid microdomains . Eisosomal BAR Domain Protein Lsp1 Forms Stable Scaffolds In Vitro and in Cells and Efﬁciently Inhibits the Lateral Diffusion of Lipids Endocytosis is a dynamic process , which requires a large num - ber of proteins . The membrane - bound scaffolds formed by the endocytic BAR / F - BAR domain proteins are transient , and their assembly and disassembly during this process are precisely regulated ( Henne et al . , 2010 ; Kaksonen et al . , 2005 ; Taylor et al . , 2011 ) . However , budding yeast also harbors another structurally similar plasma membrane invagination structure , which is very stable . These structures , called eisosomes , may function in lipid storage and homeostasis ( Walther et al . , 2006 ; Zio´ 1 kowska et al . , 2012 ) . The membrane invaginations in eisosomes are primarily generated by two BAR domain pro - teins , Pil1 and Lsp1 , which can assemble into similar oligomeric Cell Reports 4 , 1213 – 1223 , September 26 , 2013 ª 2013 The Authors 1217 helical scaffolds to the endocytic BAR and F - BAR domains ( Frost et al . , 2008 ; Kabeche et al . , 2011 ; Karotki et al . , 2011 ; Mim et al . , 2012 ; Olivera - Couto et al . , 2011 ; Zio´ 1 kowska et al . , 2011 ) . Thus , we examined the effects of the Lsp1 BAR domain on the organization and dynamics of phosphoinositides in vitro . Similarly to the BAR domain of Rvs161 / 167 , the BAR domain of Lsp1 decreased membrane ﬂuidity , indicating that , in addition to interaction with the lipid head groups , it pene - trates into the acyl - chain region of the bilayer ( Figure 5A ) . Figure 3 . BAR Domains Induce the Forma - tion of Stable Lipid Microdomains by Signif - icantly Diminishing the Lateral Diffusion of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( A ) In a control vesicle , rapid recovery of TopFluor - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 was observed during the 50 s period following photobleaching . ( B ) Both PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and associated proteins dis - played very slow recovery in membrane clusters and tubular regions induced by the Rvs161 / 167 BAR domain . Although partial recovery could be observed in the planar region of the photo - bleached area 2 min after the photobleaching , no recovery was detected at the membrane tubules . Pleasenotethattheunbleachedtipsofthetubules remain green during the recovery period , but the green TopFluor - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 does not detectably diffuse into the BAR domain - induced membrane tubules during the recovery period ( arrowhead ) . Thus , the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 molecules do not display detectable diffusion within the BAR domain - induced membrane tubules . ( C ) The BAR domain of Pinkbar and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 dis - played very slow recovery on planar membranes , suggesting that the BAR domain of Pinkbar forms stable scaffolds on membrane that efﬁciently decrease the diffusion of phosphoinositides .

In each case , the data are mean ofatleastﬁveindependentexperimentsand the error bars indicate ± SD . Further information on the analysis of FRAP data can be found in Figure S6 . The lipid composition was POPC : POPE : POPS : PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 : TopFluor - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 = 50 : 20 : 20 : 9 : 1 . The protein concentrations were 1 m M . The scale bar represents 10 m m . Lsp1 BAR domain also promoted the quenching of BODIPY - conjugated PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in a concentration - dependent manner , indicating that it induces the clustering of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( Figure 5B ) . Impor - tantly , FRAP analysis on GUVs revealed that the BAR domain of Lsp1 forms sta - ble scaffolds , which efﬁciently inhibit the lateral diffusion of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( Figures 5C and 5E ) . FRAP analysis on budding yeast cells expressing an RFP fusion of the full - length Lsp1 protein revealed that this protein also assembles into similar stable clusters at the plasma membrane of cells as on the GUVs in vitro ( Figures 5D and 5F ) . Taken together , these data show that the eisoso - mal BAR domain scaffolds also generate extremely stable lipid microdomains in vitro . Importantly , full - length Lsp1 displays similar dynamics in vivo compared to its isolated BAR domain on GUVs , suggesting that this protein efﬁciently also diminishes the lateral diffusion of lipids at the plasma membrane of living cells . 1218 Cell Reports 4 , 1213 – 1223 , September 26 , 2013 ª 2013 The Authors DISCUSSION BAR superfamily proteins are key regulators of plasma mem - brane morphology and contribute to a wide range of cellular pro - cesses , ranging from endocytosis to cell migration and adhesion ( Qualmann et al . , 2011 ; Zhao et al . , 2011 ) . BAR domains sculpt membranes to generate plasma membrane protrusions and invaginations , but whether these proteins can also affect other physicochemical properties of membranes has not been re - ported . Strikingly , our data revealed that the protein scaffolds formed by BAR superfamily domains ‘‘freeze’’ lipid dynamics by nearly completely inhibiting the lateral diffusion of phosphoi - nositides and can thus generate extremely stable protein - lipid microdomains . Generation of stable lipid microdomains appears to be a gen - eral and speciﬁc feature of all BAR domain proteins . This is because all BAR domains tested here generated extremely sta - ble phosphoinositide microdomains , whereas a PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - bind - ing pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domain did not display detectable effects on the lateral diffusion of phosphoinositides ( Figure S6C ) . Importantly , membrane curvature alone is not responsible for diminished lipid diffusion in these structures , but BAR domain in - teractions with the lipid head groups play an important role . This is because , although lateral diffusion of lipid molecules in tubular ( diameter 10 nm ) membranes is (cid:1) 2 - to 3 - fold slower compared to planar membranes ( Domanov et al . , 2011 ) , the diffusion of phosphoinositides in the BAR / F - BAR domain - induced mem - brane tubules ( with a diameter of (cid:1) 20 nm ) was at least two orders of magnitude slower compared to control membranes . Furthermore , the lateral diffusion of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is dramatically diminished on planar membranes induced by the BAR domain of Pinkbar ( Figures 3C and 3D ) . Thus , assembly of elongated BAR and F - BAR domains , which interact with phosphoinositides through a multivalent manner ( Figures 2 and 5B ) , into helical scaffolds around membrane tubules ( Frost et al . , 2008 ; Mim et al . , 2012 ) or as a sheet on a ﬂat membrane ( Pyka¨la¨inen et al . , 2011 ) will severely limit the diffusion of individual phosphoi - nositide molecules . The effects of BAR domains on the lateral diffusion of phosphoinositides are strongly dependent on protein density and seem to require the assembly of oligomeric BAR domain scaffolds . In agreement with this conclusion , a recent study proposed that the amphiphysin - 1 BAR domain functions as a membrane curvature sensor at low protein density , whereas a high local density of the domain is required for its ability to oli - gomerize and induce membrane tubules ( Sorre et al . , 2012 ) . BAR domains may also have profound effects on membrane dynamics in cells . The eisosomal BAR domains Pil1 ( Brach et al . , 2011 ; Kabeche et al . , 2011 ) and Lsp1 ( Figure 5 ) form very stable plasma membrane - associated scaffolds in yeast cells , which are expected to display similar effects on lipid - dy - namics , as we observed for Lsp1 scaffolds in vitro . Although the BAR domain scaffolds in endocytosis are precisely controlled and transient , these proteins are capable in forming very stable structures in cells if their regulation is disturbed . Figure 4 . The F - BAR / BAR Domains of Syp1 , Bzz1 , and Rvs161 / 167 Inhibit the Lateral Diffusion of Zwitterionic Lipid PE in the Membrane Clusters and Tubules ( A ) A FRAP assay measuring the diffusion of NBD head group - labeled PE revealed that the lateral diffusion of this zwitterionic lipid was diminished in membrane clusters / tubules induced by the Rvs161 / 167 BAR domain . ( B ) Quantiﬁcation of NBD - PE ﬂuorescence recov - ery in control vesicles and in Rvs161 / 167 BAR domain - induced membrane tubules / clusters . It is important to note that a smaller fraction of NBD head group - labeled PE compared to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( (cid:1) 40 % versus 75 % ) displayed very slow lateral diffusion in BAR domain - induced structures . This is most likely due to less extensive enrichment of PE in BAR domain - induced membrane tubules compared to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( see Figure 2D ) . ( C ) Dynamics of the acyl - chain labeled PC displayed only approximately 5 - fold decrease in lateral diffusion in BAR domain clusters compared to control vesicles , and unlike head group labeled PE , itreachedfullﬂuorescencerecoveryduringthe 10 min monitoring period . In all cases , the data are mean of at least ﬁve independent experiments and the error bar indicates ± SD . The lipid composition was POPC : POPE : POPS : PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 : NBD - PE / BODIPY - HPC = 50 : 19 : 20 : 10 : 1 . The concentration of the BAR domain of Rvs161 / 167 was 1 m M . The scale bar represents 10 m m . Cell Reports 4 , 1213 – 1223 , September 26 , 2013 ª 2013 The Authors 1219 For example , a recent study revealed that a small molecule inhibition of the clathrin function resulted in the formation of very stable FCHo2 F - BAR domain scaffolds in mammalian cells ( von Kleist et al . , 2011 ) and that F - BAR domain protein FBP17 displays slow turnover in membrane tubules in a cell - free system ( Wu et al . , 2010 ) . Furthermore , previous studies suggested that the diffusion of lipids at the plasma membrane varies signiﬁ - cantly between different surface domains ( Wolfe et al . , 1998 ) and that distinct PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 pools are present at the inner leaﬂet Figure 5 . The BAR Domain of Eisosomal Protein Lsp1 Forms Stable Membrane Microdomains , and the Protein Displays Slow Dynamics at the Plasma Membrane of Yeast Cells ( A ) TheBARdomainofLsp1decreasedmembrane ﬂuidity in a concentration - dependent manner , as indicated by the increase in steady - state DPH anisotropy . This suggests that the domain not only interacts with the lipid head groups but also pen - etrates into the acyl - chain region of the bilayer . The lipid composition was POPC : POPE : POPS : PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 = 50 : 20 : 20 : 10 . DPH was incorporated at 1 / 500ratio , andthelipidconcentration was40 m M . ( B ) The Lsp1 BAR domain efﬁciently induced the clustering of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , as measured by the self - quenching of BODIPY - TMR - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . The lipid composition was as described in Figure 2A . ( C ) FRAP analysis on GUVs revealed that the BAR domain of Lsp1 forms stable protein scaffolds and efﬁciently inhibits the lateral diffusion of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . The scale bar represents 10 m m .

The values in the graph are mean of ten in - dependent FRAP experiments , and the error bars represent ± SD . of the plasma membrane ( Golebiewska et al . , 2008 ) . Finally , the lateral diffusion of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in cardiomyocyte membranes and at the plasma membrane of patho - genic fungus Candida albicans were reported to be surprisingly slow ( Cho et al . , 2005 ; Vernay et al . , 2012 ) , sug - gesting that , in living cells , the dynamics of lipids at the plasma membrane are greatly affected by interactions with various membrane - binding proteins , including the BAR domain scaffolds . Generation of stable membrane microdomains by BAR su - perfamily proteins may have an important biological role in various processes . Inhibition of lateral diffusion of phosphoino - sitides is expected to generate lipid - phase boundaries at both ends of the BAR domain scaffold . These sites may act as hot spots for vesicle scission in endocytosis , as proposed by Liu et al . ( 2009 ) , because of high line tension at domain 1220 Cell Reports 4 , 1213 – 1223 , September 26 , 2013 ª 2013 The Authors boundaries . However , a recent study provided evidence that insertion of amphipathic motifs to the bilayer would drive vesicle scission during endocytosis ( Boucrot et al . , 2012 ) . These two possible vesicle scission mechanisms are not necessarily mutually exclusive . Thus , future studies are needed to elucidate their relative contributions , combined with the force provided by actin polymerization , to vesicle scission dur - ing endocytosis . In addition to the role in vesicle scission , the stable membrane microdomains induced by BAR domains are expected to function as lipid diffusion barriers . Our data show that BAR domain scaffolds efﬁciently inhibit the diffusion of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 without drastically affecting the dynamics of those lipid species ( e . g . , PE and PC ) that do not display speciﬁc in - teractions with the BAR domain scaffold . Furthermore , we pro - pose that the stable BAR / F - BAR domain scaffolds and the un - derlying PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 microdomains may limit the diffusion of transmembrane proteins and cytoplasmic membrane - anchored proteins . This could be important for trapping certain membrane proteins at the tip of the endocytic bud , as well as for preventing the entry of other membrane anchored mole - cules into this region ( see Figure 6 ) , although additional in vitro and in vivo work is required to reveal the exact organi - zation and function of BAR domain proteins at the endocytic sites . Thus , BAR superfamily proteins may form diffusion bar - riers in smaller scale structures compared to septins , which are membrane - associated proteins that form diffusion barriers , for example , at the primary cilia and at the neck of budding yeast cells ( Saarikangas and Barral , 2011 ) . In the case of eiso - somes , the stable BAR domain - induced tubular lipid microdo - mains may be important in storage of lipids and membrane - anchored proteins . Our data also demonstrate that the BAR / F - BAR domains of Syp1 , Bzz1 , and Rvs161 / 167 display signiﬁcant differences in their lipid speciﬁcities , as well as in interactions with the acyl - chain region of the lipid bilayer . These differences may at least partially account for the speciﬁc roles of the three proteins dur - ing distinct steps of the endocytic internalization process . For example , clear PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 speciﬁcity of the Rvs161 / 167 BAR domain heterodimer compared to Syp1 F - BAR domain is in line with the increase in PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels in conjunction with coat and actin assembly during endocytosis in budding yeast ( Sun et al . , 2007 ; Sun and Drubin , 2012 ) . It is , however , impor - tant to note that Syp1 , Bzz1 , and Rvs161 / 167 are relatively large multidomain proteins that also harbor other interaction motifs . Syp1 , for example , contains another short membrane - binding motif following the F - BAR domain ( Reider et al . , 2009 ) . Thus , these additional motifs are likely to affect the membrane - binding properties of the full - length proteins and to thus introduce further complexity to the membrane interac - tion mechanisms of these three endocytic BAR / F - BAR domain proteins . Interestingly , although only the Rvs161 / 167 BAR domain displayed clear preference toward vesicles with high PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 density , the F - BAR domains of Syp1 and Bzz1 can also induce PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 clustering in vitro ( Figures 1A and 2A ) . Structurally , this may be explained by much smaller positively charged phosphoinositide - binding interface on the F - BAR domain of Syp1 compared to the BAR domain of Rvs161 / 167 ( Reider et al . , 2009 ) . This site is expected to induce phosphoi - nositide clustering at low PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 densities , whereas higher PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 density on the membrane could induce repulsion forces between negatively charged phosphate groups of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and the neutral / negatively charged amino acids outside the phosphoinositide - binding pocket of Syp1 . It is , however , also important to note that the self - assembly mecha - nisms of N - BAR and F - BAR domains are different . Protein scaf - folds formed by endophilin N - BAR domain are held together through interactions between endophilin’s amphipathic N - ter - minal helices , whereas the F - BAR domain scaffolds are stabi - lized through lateral contacts between the coiled - coil regions of the domains ( Frost et al . , 2008 ; Mim et al . , 2012 ) . Impor - tantly , membrane insertion of the N - terminal a helix of Rvs161 / 167 , endophilin , and amphiphysin BAR domains is enhanced by PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( Figures S3E and S3F ; Yoon et al . , 2012 ) , demonstrating that , in addition to the coiled - coil region , also the N - terminal helix contributes to phosphoinositide spec - iﬁcity of N - BAR domains . Figure 6 . A Schematic Model of the Effects of F - BAR / BAR Domains on the Distribution and Dynamics of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in Endocytic In - vaginations ( A ) Syp1 is the ﬁrst BAR superfamily protein to arrive at the sites of endocytosis in budding yeast . Although the F - BAR domain of Syp1 does not displayspeciﬁcityforPI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , itefﬁcientlyinhibits the lateral diffusion of phosphoinositides in the clusters ( bluearrow ) . Thus , theSyp1oligomermay form a lipid diffusion barrier between the tip of the invagination ( black arrow ) and the surrounding regions of the plasma membrane ( pink arrows ) . ( B ) During the subsequent phase of endocytosis , Bzz1 binds at the invagination base through its F - BAR domain to stabilize the endocytic site with Rvs161 / 167 , which localizes along the membrane tubule through its BAR domain . The Bzz1 - Rvs161 / 167 scaffold efﬁciently inhibits the lateral diffusion ofPI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 inthisregion ( blue arrow ) and maythusbeinvolved invesicle scission . Thephosphoinositides and membrane proteins outside thisregion candiffuse freely ( pink arrows ) but cannot enter to the neck region , due to a lipid diffusion barrier formed by Bzz1 and Rvs161 / 167 . Similarly , phosphoinositides and membrane proteins can diffuse within the tip of the endocytic bud ( black arrow ) but cannot exit the site , due to the lipid diffusion barrier . Cell Reports 4 , 1213 – 1223 , September 26 , 2013 ª 2013 The Authors 1221 In conclusion , this work provides evidence that , in addition to their membrane curvature sensing / generating activity , BAR do - mains also induce the formation of extremely stable membrane microdomains . The phosphoinositide microdomains induced by the membrane - associated BAR domain scaffolds are distinct from classical lipid rafts , which arise through preferen - tial association of sterols , sphingolipids , and speciﬁc integral membrane proteins ( Lingwood and Simons , 2010 ) . Although our experiments with the eisosomal BAR domain protein Lsp1 suggested that BAR domains can also form stable membrane scaffolds in vivo to limit lipid diffusion , future studies will be needed to elucidate the extent to which BAR domains affect lateral diffusion of lipids in cells and the biological roles of this activity . These studies will require development of new methods that would allow the dynamics of speciﬁc lipid species in living cells to be studied . Moreover , future studies are needed to reveal the exact nature of the BAR / F - BAR domain scaffolds at the neck of endocytic invaginations , and to un - cover how these scaffolds affect the diffusion of membrane proteins during endocytosis . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Lipid - Binding Assays The lipid - binding assays were performed as described in Saarikangas et al . ( 2009 ) . The tryptophan ﬂuorescence assay for examining the interaction of Bzz1 F - BAR domain with vesicles was carried out as described in Zhao et al . , ( 2010 ) . In the replacement cosedimentation assay , 1 m M Syp1 F - BAR domainwasincubatedwith250 m Mliposomesfor10minfollowedbytheaddi - tionoftheBARdomainofRvs161 / 167 . Thesamplewasincubatedfor10minat room temperature , and the vesicles and bound proteins were sedimented by centrifugation . Homo - FRET anisotropy of Rvs - Cherry The steady state homo - FRETanisotropyof Rvs - Cherrywasmeasured by Per - kin - Elmer LS 55 spectrometer . Rvs161 was tagged with Cherry at its C termi - nus . The heterodimeric Rvs161 / 167 BAR domain was excited at 585 nm and emission was set at 604 nm , with both bandwidths of 5 nm . The concentration of Rvs - Cherry was 0 . 5 m M . Homo - FRET anisotropy was not applied for Syp1 and Bzz1 F - BAR domains , because they are homodimers and thus contain two closely connected cherry molecules already in solution . FRAP and Live - Imaging of GUVs Imaging of GUVs was performed on a confocal microscope ( Leica TCS SP5 ) equipped with Leica Confocal Software . A HCX PL APO 63X / 1 , 2 W Corr / 0 , 17 CS ( water ) Lbd . bl . objective was used for all experiments . In the GUV binding assay , the protein concentration was 1 m M . In the Syp1 - GFP and Rvs161 / 167 - Cherry competition assay , both proteins were premixed at equal con - centration and added to the GUV at a ﬁnal concentration of 1 m M . GFP , TopﬂuorPIP 2 , and NBD - PE were imaged using a 488 nm laser line , and Cherry - fusion proteins were imaged using a 561 nm laser line . Three pre - bleach images were taken , and after which , ﬁve bleaching scans ( 3 . 9 s each ) with 100 % intensity of 488 nm laser lines over the region of interest were performed . Recovery of ﬂuorescence was monitored ten times every 3 . 9 s , 60 times every 1 s , and 20 times every 30 s . The intensity of the bleached area was normalized to the nonbleached GUV ﬂuorescence inten - sity to diminish error caused by normal photobleaching during the monitoring period . The value before bleach was normalized to 1 . 0 , and mean plots were calculated from ﬁve to nine different FRAP experiments . All the error bars indicate ± SD . The data were ﬁtted with SigmaPlot 11 . 0 to a single f = a * ( 1 – exp ( – b * x ) exponential equation . Mobile fractions and recovery half - times ( t 1 / 2 ) were obtained for each recovery curve , and the means and stan - dard deviations were calculated .
