Two major plasminogen - binding proteins that exposed C - terminal lysines on the cell surface contained amino acid sequences corresponding to (cid:1) / (cid:2) - actin . An anti - actin monoclonal antibody inhibited cell - dependent plasminogen activation and also enhanced nicotine - dependent catecholamine release . Our results suggest that cell - surface - expressed forms of actin bind plasminogen , thereby promoting plasminogen activation and increased prohor - mone processing leading to inhibition of neurotransmitter release . Key words : chromaffin cell ; plasminogen ; release ; actin ; nicotinic ; catecholamine Introduction An emerging area of research has demonstrated a novel role for theserineproteaseplasminasaprohormone - processingprotease in the neuroendocrine system ( Parmer et al . , 2000 ; Hoover - Plow et al . , 2001 ; Jiang et al . , 2001 ; Colombo et al . , 2002 ; Q . Jiang et al . , 2002 ; Pang et al . , 2004 ; N . Wang et al . , 2004 ) . For example , pro - hormones , secreted by cells within the sympathoadrenal system , are processed by plasmin to bioactive peptides that feed back to inhibit secretagogue - stimulated catecholamine release ( Parmer et al . , 2000 ; Jiang et al . , 2001 ; Q . Jiang et al . , 2002 ) . Catecholamin - ergic cells of the sympathoadrenal system , including chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla and sympathetic neurons , are proto - typic prohormone - secreting cells that concomitantly secrete the plasminogen activator tissue plasminogen activator ( t - PA ) , in response to specific secretagogue stimulation ( Gualandris et al . , 1996 ; Parmer et al . , 1997 ) . The processing of prohormones by plasmin is markedly enhanced when plasminogen is bound to the catecholaminergic cell surface ( Parmer et al . , 2000 ; Miles et al . , 2002 ) . Consequently , positive and negative modulation of the local cellular fibrinolytic system of catecholaminergic cells results in substantial changes in catecholamine release ( Parmer et al . , 2000 ) . The mechanisms for enhancing prohormone processing and cell - surface molecules mediating the enhancement on the catecholaminergic cell surface have not been elucidated . There - fore , in the present study we investigated the ability of plasmin - ogen binding sites on catecholaminergic cells to promote plas - minogen activation as a mechanism to enhance local plasmin production and regulate neurotransmitter release . We found that plasminogen activation was markedly stimulated on the cat - echolaminergic cell surface via a specific interaction with plas - minogen binding sites . Catecholaminergic cells , including PC12 pheochromocytoma cells and bovine chromaffin cells , have a high capacity for plas - minogen ( Parmer et al . , 2000 ; Miles et al . , 2002 ) . Therefore , no single molecule can account for the entire plasminogen binding capacity of these cells . Therefore , we focused specifically on iden - tification of the plasminogen binding sites that stimulate plas - minogen activation .

Therefore , we used a novel strategy , combin - ing targeted specific proteolysis with CpB with a proteomics ap - proach using two - dimensional gel electrophoresis ( 2D - PAGE ) , radioligand blotting , and tandem mass spectrometry and identi - fied cell - surface forms of actin as major plasminogen receptors responsible for stimulation of plasminogen activation , leading to prohormone processing and inhibition of catecholamine release by catecholaminergic cells . The results of our study define a key cell - surface - dependent mechanism underlying the ability of neu - rosecretory cells to locally promote plasminogen activation for enhancementofprohormoneprocessingandmodulationofneu - rotransmitter release . Materials and Methods Proteins and peptides . Glu - plasminogen was purified from fresh human blood as described previously ( Deutsch and Mertz , 1970 ; Parmer et al . , 2000 ) . Peptides were synthesized and purified as in our previous studies ( Beebe et al . , 1989 ; Jiang et al . , 2001 ) . Cells . PC12 cells derived from a rat pheochromocytoma ( Greene and Tischler , 1976 ) were obtained from Dr . D . Schubert ( Salk Institute , La Jolla , CA ) and were grown as described in DMEM supplemented with 5 % fetal calf serum , 10 % horse serum , 100 U / ml penicillin G , and 100 (cid:3) g / ml streptomycin at 37°C , 6 % CO 2 ( Parmer et al . , 1993 , 1997 , 2000 ; Jiang et al . , 2001 ) . Bovine chromaffin cells were isolated from bovine adrenal glands as described previously ( Parmer et al . , 1997 , 2000 ; Miles et al . , 2002 ) . The cells were cultured in minimal essential medium containing 1 % nones - sential amino acids , 1 % L - glutamine , 10 % fetal calf serum , 1 % ampho - tericin B , 100 U / ml penicillin , and 100 (cid:3) g / ml streptomycin . Before CpB treatment , subconfluent , adherent PC12 cells that had been cultured for 48 h without a change of media were harvested by rinsing flasks twice with PBS at 4°C and detached with 5 m M EDTA / PBS at37°Cfor5min . Thecellswereresuspendedin20m M HEPES ( HBSS ) at a final concentration of 3 (cid:3) 10 7 cells / ml , and CpB ( Boehringer Mann - heim , Indianapolis , IN ) was added to a final concentration of 100 U / ml . The cells were incubated for 30 min at 37°C with gentle agitation every 5 min . Control cells were incubated with an equivalent volume of PBS . Before subcellular fractionation , cells were washed three times in HBSS and resuspended at 3 (cid:3) 10 7 cells / ml in 20 m M HEPES , pH 7 . 2 , containing the protease inhibitors 2 (cid:3) M leupeptin ( Calbiochem , La Jolla , CA ) , 1 . 5 (cid:3) M pepstatin A ( Calbiochem ) , 50 kIU / ml Trasylol , 8 (cid:3) M 2 - guanidinoethylmercaptosuccinicacid ( Calbiochem ) , and2m M PMSF . The cells were chilled on ice for 5 min and sheared in a 7 ml Dounce homogenizer ( Kontes , Vineland , NJ ) . After homogenization , an equiva - lentvolumeof20m M HEPEScontaining0 . 5 M sucrose , 10m M MgCl 2 , 0 . 1 M KCl , 2 m M CaCl 2 , and the protease inhibitors above was added to the cell homogenate . Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 500 (cid:3) g , and the supernatant was then centrifuged at 100 , 000 (cid:3) g for 1 h . The membrane pellet was washed by centrifugation three times with 20 m M HEPES containing 0 . 25 M sucrose , 5 m M MgCl 2 , 0 . 2 M KCl , 1 m M CaCl 2 , and the protease inhibitors above . Ligand binding assays . Ligand binding assays were performed as de - scribed previously ( Parmer et al . , 2000 ) with PC12 cells in suspension ( 0 . 5 – 1 . 0 (cid:3) 10 7 cells / ml ) in HBSS containing 0 . 1 % bovine serum albu - min ( BSA ) in a volume of 200 (cid:3) l in 1 . 5 ml polypropylene tubes with 0 . 2 (cid:3) M 125 I - plasminogen . Bound and free ligand were separated by layering three 50 (cid:3) l aliquots from each reaction mixture over 300 (cid:3) l of 20 % sucrose , centrifuging for 2 min , and cutting off the tube tips . Nonspecific binding was determined as counts bound in the presence of 0 . 2 M (cid:4) - aminocaproic acid ( EACA ) , and specific binding was determined by subtracting nonspecific binding from total binding . Plasminogen activation assays . For plasminogen activation assays , cells were preincubated with 2 . 7 (cid:3) M glu - plasminogen at 37°C for 30 min . Then 20 n M single - chain recombinant human t - PA ( Genentech , South San Francisco , CA ) was added . Plasmin activity ( expressed as OD 405 n M ) was measured after 6 min by diluting the reaction mixture 1 : 10 into S - 2251 ( DiaPharma Group , Franklin , OH ) to a final concentration of 1 m M and monitoring absorbance at 405 n M as described previously ( Felez et al . , 1996 ) . Fluorescence - activated cell - sorting analysis . Subconfluent , adherent PC12 cells that had been cultured for 48 h without a change of medium were harvested by rinsing flasks twice with PBS at 4°C and detached with 5 m M EDTA / PBS at 37°C for 5 min . All fluorescence - activated cell - sorting ( FACS ) analyses were performed as described previously ( Ran - son et al . , 1998 ) . Briefly , for the detection of cell - surface actin on viable PC12 cells and viable bovine adrenal chromaffin cells , indirect immuno - fluorescence staining and dual - color FACS analyses were performed . [ Bovine adrenal chromaffin cells were identified with an anti - CD56 an - tibody ( Exalpha Biological , Watertown , MA ) and gated after plotting forwardscatterversussidescatterasdescribedpreviously ( Muenchetal . , 2003 ) . ] Cells ( 2 (cid:3) 10 5 ) were incubated with 60 (cid:3) g / ml of either an anti - actin monoclonal antibody ( clone 4 , IgG 1K ; Chemicon , Temecula , CA ) or an irrelevant IgG 1K isotype control , MOPC - 21C ( Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) , for 30 min in binding buffer ( HBSS containing 0 . 1 % BSA ) at 4°C . The cells were washed three times with 200 (cid:3) l of binding buffer and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) - conjugated goat anti - mouse IgG ( 1 : 50 dilution of stock in binding buffer ) for 30 min at 4°C in the dark . The cells were washed again , resuspended in 200 (cid:3) l of binding buffer containing the non - vital dye propidium iodide ( PI ) at 5 (cid:3) g / ml , and immediately analyzed by dual - color FACS as described above . Pop - ulations of cells were gated according to the fluorescence intensity of PI staining . The population of cells with low cell - associated PI fluorescence intensity ( cells that excluded PI ) were defined as viable cells , whereas the population of cells with high PI fluorescence intensity ( inclusion of PI ) were defined as non - viable . Quantitative flow cytometry . Quantitative flow cytometric equilibrium binding of an FITC - conjugated anti - actin Fab fragment ( Sigma ) to the cells was performed as described previously ( Waller et al . , 2001 ) . Briefly , the output from the flow cytometer was standardized into mean equiva - lent standard fluorescence units ( MESF ) using beads impregnated with different MESF units of FITC as described previously ( Waller et al . , 2001 ) . The fluorescence intensity change of the FITC - conjugated anti - actin Fab fragment conformational change ( Q (cid:4) D I f / D I o , where I i and I f are the initial and final fluorescence intensities of FITC – anti - actin , re - spectively ) was determined using a F500 fluorometric plate reader . Two - dimensional gel electrophoresis . Denaturing first - dimension iso - electric focusing ( IEF ) was performed in a vertical slab format . The IEF gelmixturecontained2 % TritonX - 100and9 M ureawith2 . 0 % Bio - Lytes ( Bio - Rad , Hercules , CA ) , pH 6 – 8 , in a 4 % polyacrylamide gel with pi - perazine diacrylamide ( Bio - Rad ) as a cross - linker . Either 100 (cid:3) g of membrane proteins or 10 (cid:3) g of cytoplasmic proteins in 0 . 25 % SDS , 2 % Triton X - 100 , 9 M urea , and 2 % ampholines was loaded onto the IEF gels and focused under constant voltage using a stepped - voltage gradient from 50 to 250 V for a total of 4000 V - hours , with the current never exceeding15mA . TheIEFgelswerefixedin12 % trichloroaceticacidand washed six times with 50 ml of H 2 O . Individual lanes were excised from the gels and soaked in reduced sample buffer to resolubilize the proteins . Each lane was placed on the second dimension gel and overlaid with molten 0 . 5 % agarose in 120 m M Tris , pH 6 . 8 . Second - dimension SDS - PAGE was performed according to the method of Laemmli ( 1970 ) . Ligand blotting . Samples were subjected to 2D - PAGE and transferred toImmobilonP ( Millipore , Bedford , MA ) at100mAfor18hineither25 m M Tris - HCl containing 192 m M glycine and 10 % methanol or 10 m M CAPS ( 3 - ( cyclohexylamino ) propanesulfonic acid ) buffer , pH 11 , with 10 % methanol . Blots were blocked for 2 h in 2 % BSA in PBS containing 0 . 1 % Tween 20 ( PBS - BSA ) and incubated with 50 n M 125 I - plasminogen in PBS - BSA for 2 h at 22°C . The blots were washed seven times with PBS - BSA containing 0 . 5 M NaCl , dried , and subjected to autoradiogra - phy . Control blots were incubated with 50 n M 125 I - plasminogen in the presence of 0 . 1 M EACA . Autoradiography was performed using BioMax MS film ( Eastman Kodak , Rochester , NY ) . Autoradiograms were digi - tized and analyzed by two - dimensional spot densitometry ( Alpha Inno - tech , San Leandro , CA ) to determine differences in spot density . 13018 • J .

Chromaffin cell cate - cholamine secretion was determined as described previously ( Parmer et al . , 1993 , 1997 , 2000 ; Jiang et al . , 2001 ) . Briefly , PC12 cells were labeled for 2 h with [ 3 H ] norepinephrine ( PerkinElmer Life Sciences , Boston , MA ) at1 (cid:3) Ci / mlincellculturemedium , washedtwicewithreleasebuffer ( 150 m M NaCl , 5 m M KCl , 2 m M CaCl 2 , and 10 m M HEPES , pH 7 . 0 ) , and incubated at 37°C for 30 min in release buffer in either the presence or absence of nicotine . After aspirating the release buffer , the cells were harvested and lysed in release buffer containing 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 . [ 3 H ] norepinephrine content of release buffer , and cell lysates were deter - mined by liquid - scintillation counting . The percentage of release was calcu - lated as percentage of secretion [ amount released / ( amount released (cid:5) amountincelllysate ) ] , andresultsareexpressedasnetrelease ( percentageof secretagogue - stimulated release (cid:6) percentage of basal release ) . Protein determinations . Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA protein assay ( Bio - Rad ) using BSA as a standard . Statistics . Data are presented as means (cid:7) SEM . Results were analyzed by ANOVA , followed by Student – Newman – Keuls post hoc tests for mul - tiple comparisons . Results Cellular augmentation of plasminogen activation on catecholaminergic cells Prohormone processing by the serine protease plasmin is en - hanced in the presence of catecholaminergic cells ( Parmer et al . , 2000 ) . Therefore , as a mechanism to promote processing , we tested whether plasminogen activation is enhanced when plas - minogen is bound to PC12 pheochromocytoma cells . In the pres - ence of cells , plasminogen activation was markedly increased in a cell concentration - dependent manner , reaching a plateau at 1 . 67 (cid:3) 10 5 cells / ml ( Fig . 1 A ) . At this saturating cell density , the enhancement caused by the presence of cells was 6 . 5 - fold . PC12 cellssynthesizeandreleaset - PAinresponsetosecretagoguestim - ulation ( Gualandris et al . , 1996 ; Parmer et al . , 1997 ) . Further - more , the plasminogen activator urokinase and its receptor uPAR are present in these cells ( Pittman et al . , 1989 ; Fowler et al . , 1998 ; Herschman et al . , 2000 ) . Therefore , we tested whether en - dogenous cellular plasminogen activators could contribute to the cell - dependent plasminogen activation . The rate of plasminogen activation in the presence of 3 . 3 (cid:3) 10 5 cells / ml plus plasminogen without the addition of exogenous t - PA was only 13 % of that in the presence of cells plus plasminogen plus t - PA . These data were consistent with the effect of the cells in enhancement of plasmin - ogen activation , being primarily attributable to a cell - surface - dependent mechanism . We performed similar cell - dependent plasminogen activation assays using primary bovine adrenal chromaffin cells that also express plasminogen binding sites ( Miles et al . , 2002 ) . Bovine chromaffin cells markedly enhanced t - PA - dependent plasmino - gen activation in a dose - dependent manner , approaching a pla - teau above 1 . 5 (cid:3) 10 5 cells / ml ( Fig . 1 B ) . At a saturating cell den - sity of 3 (cid:3) 10 5 cells / ml , the enhancement caused by the presence of the bovine chromaffin cells was (cid:2) 10 - fold . As with the PC12 cells , the enhancement was not attributable to secretion of t - PA by the cells , because plasminogen activation in the presence of cells plus plasminogen only was not detected . Role of C - terminal lysines in plasminogen binding and activation on the catecholaminergic cell surface The interactions of plasminogen with substrates and regulatory molecules are dependent on lysine binding sites within the disulfide - bonded kringle structures of plasminogen , and there - fore these interactions are inhibited in the presence of lysine and lysine analogs , such as EACA ( for review , see Castellino and McCance , 1997 ) . The interaction of plasminogen with cat - echolaminergiccellsisalsoblockedbyEACA ( Parmeretal . , 2000 ; Miles et al . , 2002 ) , suggesting that proteins with C - terminal ly - sines , exposed on the extracellular face of the cell membrane , might serve as plasminogen binding sites . To explore the rela - tionship between plasminogen binding and stimulation of plas - minogen activation by the cells , we examined the role of proteins with C - terminal lysines in the interactions of the cells with plas - minogen . Intact cells were treated with increasing concentrations of CpB , which has a preference for cleavage at the carboxyl sides of lysyl and arginyl residues . A dose - dependent decrease in plas - minogen binding was observed , reaching a plateau at (cid:2) 70 % in - hibition in the presence of 100 U / ml CpB ( Fig . 2 A ) . Interestingly , (cid:2) 30 % of the plasminogen binding sites were not susceptible to CpB treatment , suggesting that this subpopulation of sites could bind plasminogen , but not in an orientation that would stimulate plasminogen activation .

Neurosci . , December13 , 2006 • 26 ( 50 ) : 13017 – 13024 • 13019 plasminogen - binding proteins was responsible for stimulating plasminogen activation on the cell surface , we examined whether CpB treatment of the PC12 cells affected the ability of the cells to promote plasminogen activation . CpB treatment decreased the stimulating effect of the cells on plasminogen activation in a dose - dependent manner , approaching a plateau at 88 % inhibi - tion of cell - dependent stimulation ( Fig . 2 B ) . This result suggests that the plasminogen receptors that are sensitive to CpB [ i . e . , proteins exposing C - terminal lysines ( with the conformation of EACA ) on the cell surface ] are primarily responsible for the pro - motion of plasminogen activation by these cells . Although CpB also can remove C - terminal arginyl residues , the results are most consistent with an effect on a C - terminal lysyl residue because EACA interacts with plaminogen with an affinity in the range of the affinity of plasminogen for the cells ( Violand et al . , 1975 ; Markus et al . , 1978 ; Parmer et al . , 2000 ) , whereas the affinity of arginine for plasminogen is (cid:2) 10 - fold lower ( Violand et al . , 1975 ) . Identification of CpB - sensitive cell - surface plasminogen - binding proteins We sought to identify the CpB - sensitive plasminogen - binding protein ( s ) on the surfaces of the PC12 cells as the major plasmin - ogen receptors responsible for stimulating plasminogen activa - tion on these cells . We wanted to identify only proteins that ex - posed C - terminal lysines on the cell surface and to exclude proteins present exclusively in the cytoplasm , proteins on the inner surface of the cell membrane , or inaccessible proteins on the cell surface . Therefore , intact cells were treated with 100 U / ml CpB , followed by washing . Then , cell membrane and cytoplasmic fractions were subsequently prepared , subjected to 2D - PAGE , and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes , and li - gand blotted with 125 I - plasminogen . Several plasminogen - binding proteins were present in the cell membrane preparations ( Fig . 3 A ) . [ The binding of 125 I - plasminogen was specific because no plasminogen binding spots were detected in the presence of 100 m M EACA ( data not shown ) . ] Two major spots , one with an Mr app of 45 . 1 thousand and a pI of 5 . 27 ( spot 1 ) and the other withanMr app of34 . 7thousandandapIof5 . 43 ( spot2 ) , exhibited a marked reduction in plasminogen binding capacity after treat - ment of the intact cells with CpB . The susceptibility to treatment of intact cells with CpB suggested that these proteins exposed C - terminal lysines on the cell surface ( Fig . 3 , compare A , B ) . The extent of reduction in plasminogen binding was 89 % for spot 1 and 71 % for spot 2 , based on laser densitometry of the gels . In controls for the method , plasminogen - binding proteins were present also in the cytoplasmic fractions but retained activity after CpB treatment of the intact cells , indicating that cytoplas - mic proteins were not accessible to treatment of intact cells by CpB ( Fig . 3 , compare C , D ) . Hence , only proteins on the cell surface were accessible to CpB . A major advantage of using the criterion of CpB sensitivity of proteins on the surfaces of intact cells is that even if minor amounts of cytoplasm are present in the subsequently prepared membrane fraction , cytoplasmic contam - inants are not identified as proteins exposing C - terminal lysines on the cell surface , because proteins in the cytoplasm are not processed by CpB before membrane fractionation . We purified spot 1 and spot 2 directly from the two - dimensional gels . One hundred micrograms per lane of PC12 membrane fractions were subjected to 2D - PAGE , and replicate gels were either ligand blotted with 125 I - plasminogen or stained with colloidal Coomassie . Two replicate colloidal Coomassie - Figure 2 . Effect of treatment of PC12 cells with CpB on the interaction with plasminogen .

Spot 1 and spot 2 were excised , eluted from the gels , and digested with trypsin . A capillary reverse - phase chromatograph coupled to the electrospray ionization source of a Finnigan LCQ Quadru - pole Ion Trap Mass Spectrometer was used to obtain 10 peptide sequences comprising a total of 128 unique amino acid sequences from spot 1 and 7 peptide sequences comprising a total of 79 unique amino acid residues from the tryptic digest of spot 2 ( Ta - ble 1 ) . The exact peptides ( with one exception of an I for V 75 substitution in spot 2 ) are present in the amino acid sequences of both rat (cid:1) - actin and rat (cid:2) - actin . ( Rat (cid:1) - and (cid:2) - actin are identical , with the exception of a substitution of E 2 E 3 E 4 in (cid:2) - actin for D 2 D 3 D 4 in (cid:1) - actin . ) We did not obtain sequences corresponding to the extreme N terminus of either protein from the tryptic digests of spot 1 and spot 2 . Therefore , we could not distinguish between the (cid:2) and (cid:1) isoforms . Our data were also consistent with processing of native (cid:1) / (cid:2) - actin to spot 2 by removal of both N - andC - terminalpeptidesbecausewedidnotobtainanysequences from the spot 2 digestion that were N terminal to D 184 ; we did , however , obtain a peptide with an amino acid sequence corre - sponding to amino acids 360 – 372 of the (cid:1) - and (cid:2) - actin se - quences and thus lacking only the three most C - terminal amino acids . The absence of these three amino acids , together with the CpB sensititivy of spot 2 , is consistent only with either actin res - idue K 373 or R 372 as the C terminus and thus consistent with exposure of either K 373 or R 372 on the cell surface . Likewise , se - quencing of spot 1 also yielded a peptide corresponding to amino acids 360 – 372 of the (cid:1) - and (cid:2) - actin sequences and therefore is also consistent only with exposure of either K 373 or R 372 on the cell surface . The results are most consistent with cell - surface ex - posure of K 373 ( with the structure of EACA ) because EACA in - teracts with plaminogen with an affinity , in the range of the af - finity of plasminogen for the cells ( Violand et al . , 1975 ; Markus et al . , 1978 ; Parmer et al . , 2000 ) , whereas the affinity of arginine for plasminogen is (cid:2) 10 - fold lower ( Violand et al . , 1975 ) . Because all isoforms of actin perform major intracellular functions ( Kabsch and Vandekerckhove , 1992 ) , we used FACS analysis with an anti - actin monoclonal antibody as a second method to verify the cell - surface expression of actin . When viable cells were incubated with a fluoresceinated Fab fragment of an anti - actin monoclonal antibody , the mean fluorescence intensity of the cell population was increased twofold over the isotype control , demonstrating the presence of actin on the cell surface ( Fig . 4 ) . FACS data from the viable populations of cells that were treated with different concentrations of FITC - conjugated anti - actin Fab were used to derive the apparent K d and B max of the interaction of the antibody with the cells by fitting these data ( after subtracting the fluorescence of the FITC - conjugated MOPC21C isotype control ) to the single - site binding equation [ LR ] (cid:4) ( [ L ] B max ) / ( [ L ] (cid:5) K d ) . In quantitative flow cytometry with the FITC - labeled monoclonal anti - actin Fab fragment , a B max of 9 . 8 (cid:3) 10 4 molecules of actin was determined per cell . The apparent K d for the interaction of the anti - actin Fab fragment with cell - surface actin was 645 n M . Actin expression on the surfaces of primary adrenal chromaf - fincellswasalsoevaluated . Primaryadrenalchromaffincellswere identified by CD56 expression and plotting forward scatter ver - sus side scatter as described previously ( Muench et al . , 2003 ) . Viable primary bovine adrenal chromaffin cells bound actin spe - cifically ( mean fluorescence intensity obtained with the fluores - ceinated Fab fragment of an anti - actin monoclonal was twofold greater than that of the isotype control ) . Furthermore , FITC - plasminogen binding to the primary bovine adrenal chromaffin cells was decreased by 22 (cid:7) 1 % ( n (cid:4) 3 ; p (cid:4) 0 . 001 ) in the presence of the anti - actin monoclonal antibody ( 400 n M ) . Correspond - ingly , in the presence of the monoclonal antibody , cell - surface - dependent plasminogen activation was decreased by 23 (cid:7) 1 % ( n (cid:4) 3 ; p (cid:8) 0 . 001 ) . Role of cell - surface actin in catecholamine secretion Because localization of plasminogen on catecholaminergic cells results in processing of chromogranin A ( CgA ) ( released from catecholamine storage vesicles after secretagogue stimulation ) to bioactive peptides that inhibit secretagogue - stimulated catechol - amine release ( Parmer et al . , 2000 ; Jiang et al . , 2001 ) , we tested whether antibodies against actin could modulate secretagogue - stimulated catecholamine release from catecholaminergic cells . Accordingly , PC12 cells were preloaded with [ 3 H ] norepineph - rine and stimulated with the chromaffin cell secretagogue nico - tine in the presence or absence of an anti - actin monoclonal anti - body or the isotype ( IgG1 (cid:5) ) control ( MOPC - 21C ) . In the presence of the anti - actin antibody , norepinephrine release in response to nicotine stimulation was enhanced in a dose - dependent manner , with release increased by 40 % compared with the isotype control ( MOPC - 21C ) at an antibody concentra - tion of 400 n M ( Fig . 5 ) . Consistent with these results , when plas - minogen activation assays were performed ( as in Fig . 1 ) in the presence of the anti - actin monoclonal antibody , plasminogen activation was decreased by 31 . 4 (cid:7) 0 . 3 % ( n (cid:4) 3 ; p (cid:8) 0 . 001 ) compared with the isotype control . These results are consistent with decreased plasminogen activation and , consequently , de - Table1 .

We have shown pre - viously that plasmin processes the prototypical prohormone CgA to a specific peptide [ ARAYGFRGPGPQLR , corresponding to human CgA - ( 360 – 373 ) ] that inhibits nicotinic - mediated cate - cholamine release ( Jiang et al . , 2001 ; Q . Jiang et al . , 2002 ) . Con - sistent with the foregoing results , in the presence of 10 (cid:3) M of the synthetic peptide ARAYGFRGPGPQLR , the stimulatory effect of the anti - actin antibody was markedly inhibited ( by 73 . 9 (cid:7) 6 . 1 % ; n (cid:4) 3 ; p (cid:8) 0 . 001 ) . In control experiments , the presence of the reverse peptide RLQPGPGRFGYARA had no effect on the stim - ulatory effect of the anti - actin antibody . Discussion Processing of secreted prohormones is a recently demonstrated function of the enzyme plasmin ( Parmer et al . , 2000 ; Hoover - Plow et al . , 2001 ; Jiang et al . , 2001 ; Colombo et al . , 2002 ; Q . Jiang et al . , 2002 ; Pang et al . , 2004 ; N . Wang et al . , 2004 ) . Notably , plasmin processes the prototypical prohormone CgA to a specific peptide [ human CgA - ( 360 – 373 ) ] that inhibits nicotinic - mediated catecholamine release ( Parmer et al . , 2000 ; Jiang et al . , 2001 ) . Previously , we found that plasminogen binding sites on chromaffin cells markedly stimulate plasmin processing of CgA ( Parmer et al . , 2000 ) . These interactions in the environment of catecholaminergic cells represent a novel autocrine / paracrine system that has a substantial impact on catecholamine secretion and may represent a broad paradigm for neurosecretory process - ing throughout the neuroendocrine system . Therefore , in this study , we investigated the mechanism by which catecholaminer - gic cells enhance prohormone processing and identified plasmin - ogen receptors responsible for stimulation of plasminogen acti - vation on these cells . We found that ( 1 ) plasminogen activation was markedly stimulated when plasminogen was bound to cat - echolaminergic cells , ( 2 ) proteins exposing C - terminal lysines on the cell surface were responsible for (cid:2) 90 % of the ability of the cells to stimulate plasminogen activation , ( 3 ) two isoforms of (cid:1) / (cid:2) - actin provided major plasminogen binding sites responsible forstimulationofplasminogenactivationonthesecells , ( 4 ) inthe presence of specific anti - actin antibody catecholaminergic cell - dependent plasminogen activation was markedly decreased , and ( 5 ) treatment of catecholaminergic cells with anti - actin antibody resulted in marked enhancement of secretagogue - stimulated cat - echolamine release . Together , these studies suggest the presence of cell - surface forms of actin that provide major plasminogen binding sites and promote plasminogen activation on cat - echolaminergic cells , resulting in production of inhibitory pep - tides that modulate catecholamine release during stimulation with secretagogues . In a previous study , we found that processing of CgA is mark - edly enhanced in the presence of catecholaminergic cells and is dependent on the specific interaction of plasminogen with the cells ( Parmer et al . , 2000 ) . In the current study , our data show that the major effect of the catecholaminergic cells was to pro - mote plasminogen activation . The enhancement in activation re - quired the interaction of plasminogen with cell - surface proteins exposing C - terminal lysines , because (cid:2) 90 % of the cell - dependent stimulation was lost after treatment of the cells with CpB . Of plasminogen binding sites on the cells [ i . e . , (cid:2) 4 (cid:3) 10 5 high - affinity sites ( Parmer et al . , 2000 ) ] , 70 % were accessible to CpB treatment of intact cells . Using quantitative FACS analysis , we determined 9 . 8 (cid:3) 10 4 molecules of surface - associated actin per cell . Thus , cell - surface actin represents (cid:2) 35 % of the CpB susceptible cell - surface plasminogen binding sites . Furthermore , we found that an anti - actin antibody blocked 31 . 4 % of cell - dependent stimulation of plasminogen activation . Thus , although plasminogen is expected to bind to other proteins exposing C - terminallysinesonthecellsurface , cell - surfaceactinappearstobe responsible for a major effect on cell - dependent plasminogen acti - vation and , consequently , CgA processing to produce peptides that inhibit secretagogue - stimulated catecholamine release . In the current study , we have used a novel method to define plasminogen receptors that is designed to exclusively identify molecules that expose a C - terminal lysine on the cell surface and thus stimulate plasminogen activation ( Hawley et al . , 2000 , 2001 ) . In this method , intact cells are treated with CpB , followed by preparation of membrane fractions . A comparison of 125 I - plasminogen ligand blots of untreated with CpB - treated mem - branes reveals the plasminogen - binding proteins that expose C - terminal lysines on the cell surface . This method eliminates from consideration any plasminogen binding proteins on the inner surface of the cell membrane , inaccessible proteins on the cell surface , or proteins present exclusively in the cytoplasmic compartment . Using this method , we identified two major plasminogen - binding proteins that expose C - terminal lysines on the PC12 cell surface . The two proteins were eluted from gels , digestedwithtrypsin , analyzedbymassspectrometry , andidentified as isoforms of (cid:1) / (cid:2) - actin . Our data were also consistent with loss of an (cid:2) 10 , 000 fragment at the N terminus of full - length actin ( spot 1 ) , resultinginthe34 . 7thousandactinform ( spot2 ) . TheMr app ofspot 2 at 34 . 7 thousand is consistent with proteolytic processing within theproteasesensitiveactinsubdomain2 ( JacobsonandRosenbusch , 1976 ; Mornet et al . , 1981 ; Muhlrad et al . , 2004 ) . Our data suggested that the plasminogen - binding proteins identified as rat (cid:1) / (cid:2) - actin were present on the cell surface and accessible to CpB . The cDNA sequences of these actin isoforms do not encode C - terminal lysines . Therefore , processing at the C terminus of actin is necessary to expose the C - terminal lysine . Our mass spectrometric sequencing results are consistent with exposure of either actin residue , K 373 or R 372 , on the cell surface Figure5 . Effectofananti - actinmonoclonalantibodyoncatecholaminerelease . PC12cells were preincubated with either an anti - actin monoclonal antibody ( f ) or the isotype control ( MOPC - 21C ; (cid:1) ) for30minandtreatedwith60 (cid:3) M nicotineoruntreatedat37°Cfor15min , and catecholamine release was measured as described in Materials and Methods .

Neurosci . , December13 , 2006 • 26 ( 50 ) : 13017 – 13024 Milesetal . • PlasminogenReceptorsonCatecholaminergicCells after proteolytic processing . The results are most consistent with cell - surface exposure of K 373 because EACA ( with an equivalent structure to a C - terminal lysine in a protein ) interacts with plas - minogen with an affinity in the range of the affinity of plasmin - ogen for the cells ( Violand et al . , 1975 ; Markus et al . , 1978 ; Parmer et al . , 2000 ) , whereas the affinity of arginine for plasmin - ogen is (cid:2) 10 - fold lower than that of EACA ( Violand et al . , 1975 ) . Our results suggest a major extracellular function of native (cid:1) / (cid:2) - actin and a processed form of (cid:1) / (cid:2) - actin on the cat - echolaminergic cell surface , based on the ability to bind plasmin - ogen and stimulate plasminogen activation , leading to inhibitory effects on catecholamine release . As an independent approach , we demonstrated the presence of actin on the catecholaminergic cell surface using FACS analyses . Several reports suggest the pres - ence of a cell - surface form of actin on other cell types ( Owen et al . , 1978 ; Bachvaroff et al . , 1980 ; Sanders and Craig , 1983 ; Moroianu et al . , 1993 ; Dudani and Ganz , 1996 ; Andronicos and Ranson , 2001 ; Dudani et al . , 2005 ) . Actin mediates autoproteoly - sis of plasminogen to angiostatin on cancer cells ( H . Wang et al . , 2004 , 2006 ) . The cDNA sequence of actin does not encode a classical signal sequence . Nonetheless , actin is present in the cir - culation of healthy subjects ( Thorstensson et al . , 1982 ; Emerson et al . , 1983 ; Mejean et al . , 1987 ) and release of actin from viable cultured myoblasts has been demonstrated ( Rubenstein et al . , 1982 ) , consistent with direct translocation of actin to the cell membrane or release of actin , followed by its membrane localiza - tion , although the mechanisms are not well understood . It is well known that a number of proteins lacking cleavable signal se - quences are expressed extracellularly ( Muesch et al . , 1990 ) . Our results suggest that cell - surface forms of actin bind plas - minogen and stimulate plasminogen activation on the cat - echolaminergic cell surface . The K d for the interaction of plas - minogen with purified actin is (cid:2) 70 – 140 n M ( Dudani and Ganz , 1996 ; Wang et al . , 2006 ) . These values are consistent with the high - affinity interaction of plasminogen that we have deter - mined previously on PC12 cells ( K d (cid:4) 77 n M ) ( Parmer et al . , 2000 ) . Furthermore , actin enhances plasminogen activation by t - PA ( Lind and Smith , 1991 , 1993 ) . In the current study , we found that a specific monoclonal antibody against actin inhibited cell - dependent plasminogen activation . Furthermore , in the presence of anti - actin antibody , nicotine - dependent stimulation of catecholamine release was enhanced , consistent with blockade of plasminogen activation and decreased formation of bioregu - latory inhibitory peptides . The results of our study define a key cell - surface - dependent mechanism underlying the ability of catecholaminergic cells to promote plasminogen activation and hence stimulate local auto - crine / paracrine prohormone processing ( see working model in supplemental Fig . 1 , available at www . jneurosci . org as supple - mental material ) . Expression of binding sites for plasminogen ( Parmer et al . , 2000 ; Miles et al . , 2002 ) and t - PA ( Pittman et al . , 1989 ; Parmer et al . , 2000 ) , together with the demonstration of trafficking of t - PA to catecholamine storage vesicles ( Parmer et al . , 1997 ; ParmerandMiles , 1998 ) , suggeststhepresenceofalocal catecholaminergic cell plasminogen / t - PA system that regulates cell - associated neuroendocrine prohormone processing that , in turn , may play a key role in the regulation of neurotransmitter release . Of note , molecules of the plasminogen activation path - way are present in a variety of neuroendocrine sites , including the cerebral cortex ( Sappino et al . , 1993 ) , cerebellum ( Sappino et al . , 1993 ; Friedman and Seeds , 1995 ; Zhang et al . , 2002 ) , hippocam - pus ( Qian et al . , 1993 ; Sappino et al . , 1993 ; Tsirka et al . , 1997a ; Baranes et al . , 1998 ; Salles and Strickland , 2002 ; Zhang et al . , 2002 ) , adrenal medulla ( Parmer et al . , 1997 ; Zhang et al . , 2002 ) , and in peripheral sympathetic neurons ( X . Jiang et al . , 2002 ; Hao et al . , 2006 ) . Hence , these results may suggest an important sys - tem and mechanism for the regulation of neurosecretory and catecholaminergic pathways in both central and peripheral ner - vous systems , with implications , for example , for t - PA / plasminogen - dependent processes such as long - term potentia - tion , learning , and memory ( Qian et al . , 1993 ; Carmeliet et al . , 1994 ; Frey et al . , 1996 ; Huang et al . , 1996 ; Baranes et al . , 1998 ; Seeds et al . , 2003 ; Pang et al . , 2004 ) , and excitotoxin - induced neuronal injury in the CNS ( Tsirka et al . , 1996 , 1997a , b ; Chen - Liu and Strickland , 1997 ) , as well as for the regulation of key systemic cardiovascular and metabolic homeostatic physiological responses governed by sympathoadrenal and sympathoneural activity ( Parmer et al . , 2000 ; Jiang et al . , 2001 ; Q . Jiang et al . , 2002 ; X . Jiang et al . , 2002 ) . Our current results , identifying specific , profibrinolytic plasminogen binding sites on catecholaminergic cells , thus may suggest a broad paradigm for regulating neuro - transmitter secretion within the neuroendocrine system .
