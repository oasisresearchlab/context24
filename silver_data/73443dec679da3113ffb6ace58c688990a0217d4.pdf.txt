Two cDNAs , isolated from a Xenopus laevis embryonic library , encode proteins of 168 amino acids , both of which are 77 % identical to chick cofilin and 66 % identical to chick actin - depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) , two structurally and functionally related pro - teins . These Xenopus ADF / cofilins ( XACs ) differ from each other in 12 residues spread throughout the se - quence but do not differ in charge . Purified GST - fusion proteins have pH - dependent actin - depolymerizing and F - actin - binding activities similar to chick ADF and co - filin . Similarities in the developmental and tissue spe - cific expression , embryonic localization , and in the cDNA sequences of the noncoding regions , suggest that the two XACs arise from allelic variants of the pseudo - tetraploid X . laevis . Immunofluorescence localization of XAC in oocyte sections with an XAC - specific monoclonal antibody shows it to be diffuse in the cortical cytoplasm . After fertilization , increased immunostaining is observed in two regions : along the membrane , particularly that of the vegetal hemisphere , and at the interface between the cortical and animal hemisphere cytoplasm . The cleavage furrow and the mid - body structure are stained at the end of first cleavage . Neuroectoderm derived tis - sues , notochord , somites , and epidermis stain heavily either continuously or transiently from stages 18 - 34 . A phosphorylated form of XAC ( pXAC ) was identified by 2D Western blotting , and it is the only species found in oocytes . Dephosphorylation of > 60 % of the pXAC occurs within 30 min after fertilization . Injection of one blastomere at the 2 cell stage , either with constitutively active XAC or with an XAC inhibitory antibody , blocked cleavage of only the injected blastomere in a concentration - dependent manner without inhibiting nuclear division . The cleavage furrow of eggs injected with constitutively active XAC completely regressed . Blastomeres injected with neutralized antibody devel - oped normally . These results suggest that XAC is nec - essary for cytokinesis and that its activity must be prop - erly regulated for cleavage to occur . T HE actin cytoskeleton is an essential component for cell motility , establishment of cell polarity , and main - tenance of cell shape ( for review see Stossel , 1993 ) . These are critical events for organismal development and the functioning of the differentiated state . Many different types of actin - binding proteins are involved in the organi - zation of the actin cytoskeleton and its dynamic reorgani - zation in response to environmental cues ( Pollard and Cooper , 1986 ; Bamburg and Bernstein , 1991 ) . Among these are the ubiquitous F - actin binding / severing and monomer sequestering proteins of the actin depolymeriz - ing factor ( ADF ) I / cofilin family ( for review see Sun et al . , 1995 ) . At least one member of this protein family has been Address all correspondence to James R . Bamburg , Department of Bio - chemistry and Molecular Biology , Fort Collins , CO 80523 .

Both ADF and cofilin genes are ex - pressed in mammals , and often one or the other will domi - nate in a particular cell type . These proteins are enriched in neuronal growth cones and in ruffling membranes , re - gions of high actin assembly dynamics ( Bamburg and Bray , 1987 ; Yonezawa et al . , 1987 ) , and in the cleavage furrow of cells undergoing cytokinesis ( Nagaoka et al . , 1995 ) . Avian and mammalian ADF / cofilins are regulated by phosphorylation ( Ohta et al . , 1989 ; Morgan et al . , 1993 ; Agnew et al . , 1995 ; Moriyama et al . , 1996 ) , but this type of regulation may extend to other vertebrates and inverte - brates as well . The ADF / cofilin protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an essential component of the cortical actin cytoskeleton ( Moon et al . , 1993 ; Iida et al . , 1993 ; Mulholland et al . , 1994 ) . The ability of either mammalian ADF or mamma - lian cofilin to rescue yeast deficient in cofilin confirms that these proteins have a high degree of functional equiva - lency ( Moon et al . , 1993 ; Iida et al . , 1993 ) . Functional mu - tations in the ADF / cofilin protein in Drosophila ( Ed - wards , 1994 ) are also lethal ( Gunsalus et al . , 1995 ) .

( B ) Comparison of the XAC1 and XAC2 protein sequences to those of chicken cofilin and ADF . The regulatory phosphorylation site ( V ) and the region used for preparation of isoform specific antibodies ( underline ) are shown . Caenorhabditis elegans , mutations of the ADF / cofilin gene ( unc - 60 ) lead to an uncoordinated lethal mutation arising from abnormal actin assembly into contractile units in de - veloping body wall muscle ( McKim et al . , 1994 ) . Thus , ADF / cofilins play essential roles in the development of lower eukaryotic organisms . However , their expression , activity , and distribution in early vertebrate development have not been explored . To study the role of these proteins during vertebrate de - velopment , we selected X . laevis , a rapidly developing , easily manipulated organism in which all developmental stages are readily observable .

By microinjecting embryos with an active , nonphosphorylatable form of the protein or an inhibitory antibody to the protein , we show that pro - gression through cytokinesis requires the proper level of active Xenopus ADF / cofilin . Materials and Methods Cloning of Xenopus ADF / Cofilin cDNAs A stage 30 Xenopus cDNA library in 7ZAP ( Clontech , Palo Alto , CA ) was screened with full - length cDNA probes to chicken ADF and chicken cofilin ( Abe et al . , 1990 ; Adams et al . , 1990 ) . Eight clones identified with the ADF cDNA probe and seven clones identified with the cofilin probe were selected for further study . The inserts were transferred to pBlue - script SK - by in vivo excision , restriction mapped , and partially se - quenced . They fell into two groups designated Xenopus ADF / cofilinl ( XAC1 ) and XAC2 . One cDNA from each group was sequenced com - pletely ( from the full - length cDNA and partial deletion mutants ) by the dideoxynucleotide method ( Sanger et al . , 1977 ) . Southern and Northern Blotting Genomic DNA was prepared from adult Xenopus liver by the method of Blin and Stafford ( 1976 ) . Single and double restriction endonuclease di - gestions were performed before electrophoresis , transfer to nitrocellulose , and hybridization to probes specific for each XAC cDNA . Northern blot - ting was performed on total RNA prepared from staged embryos and adult tissues by the procedure of Chomczynski and Sacchi ( 1987 ) . DNA probes for both Southern and Northern blotting were prepared from dele - tion mutants which contained only part of the 3 ' UTR of each cDNA ( 906 - 1482 for XAC1 , No . 1055 - 1507 for XAC2 ) ( see Fig . 1 ) . Some Northern blots were probed using the DNA coding region of XAC1 prepared from the Ncol to BgllI site in pBluescript as described below . Preparation of Expression Vectors The XAC1 and XAC2 cDNAs in pBluescript SK - were amplified by PCR using a 5 ' primer ( 5 ' - ACCATGGCCTCTGGTGTG - Y ) which inserted an NcoI site at the initiating codon and a 3 ' primer ( 5 ' - GAGATCTCAACT - TCI ' CACGGATIT - 3 ' ) which inserted a BglII site at the 3 ' end . These PCR products were cloned directly into the EcoRV site of pBluescript II KS + . The cDNAs were removed by digestion with NcoI and BglII for in - sertion into the NcoI / SmaI sites of a modified pGEX vector ( Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology , Piscataway , N J ) by blunt end ligation to produce glu - tathione - S - transferase fusion proteins . The modified pGEX vector con - taining an NcoI site was prepared by linearizing pGEX with BamHI , blunt ending the fragments with Klenow polymerase , inserting chicken cofilin cDNA , selecting for correct orientation , and removing the cofilin cDNA with NeoI and Sinai . Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins The pGEX expression ptasmids containing XAC1 and XAC2 were trans - formed into XL1 - Blue and recombinant protein expressed using standard procedures ( Studier et al . , 1990 ; Pharmacia , Piscataway , NJ ) . The GST - fusion proteins were purified on a glutathione column according to the manufacturer ' s directions ( Pharmacia ) , dialyzed in PBS , and stored at - 70°C after freezing in liquid nitrogen . For actin - binding studies , GST - fusion proteins were cleaved with thrombin ( Sigma Chem . Co . , St . Louis , MO ; 12 U / rag GST - fnsion protein ) . Concentrations of proteins were de - termined by a solid - phase dye - binding assay ( Minamide and Bamburg , 1990 ) . Antibody Production Polyclonal antibody was raised in rabbits against either GST - XAC1 or each of two synthetic decapeptides , IKKRLPGIKH from XAC1 and IRKRFTGIKH from XAC2 , each containing a three amino acid NH2 - ter - minal linker ( CGG ) conjugated to keyhole lympet hemocyanin ( KLH ) ( Macromolecular Resources , Fort Collins , CO ) . KLH ( 1 mg / 200 i ~ 1 serum ) was used to remove cross - reactive antibodies from the serum to the pep - tide conjugates . Antibodies to the peptides were affinity purified on a col - umn of peptide coupled to Sulfolink resin ( Pierce Chem . Co . , Rockford , IL ) . Monoclonal antibodies were prepared from rats inoculated with either the GST - XAC1 or GST - XAC2 fusion proteins . Rat lymph node cells were fused with the mouse myeloma cell line P3U1 and were selected by standard cloning methods ( Furuse et at . , 1993 ; Kohler et al . , 1980 ) . Two IgG - producing clones ( 1All and 2F10 ) were isolated and expanded in RPMI medium ( Life Technologies , Inc . , Gaithersburg , MD ) containing 15 % FBS . Growth of the 2F10 line required supplementation with 1 % BM - condimed H1 ( Boehringer Mannheim , Indianapolis , IN ) . Hybridoma supernatant was stored at 4°C or frozen at - 70°C for future use . An anti - actin polyclonal antibody was obtained as a gift from Dr . I . Ya - hara , Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science ( Iida and Yahara , 1986 ) . Its specificity against Xenopus actin was confirmed by Western blots of an egg protein extract . Activity Assays for Recombinant ADF / Cofilin The DNase I inhibition assay ( Harris et al . , 1982 ) was used to quantify the depolymedzation of F - actin by the GST - XAC1 and GST - XAC2 fusion proteins . The DNase I was calibrated with muscle G - actin . The pH - depen - dent binding of XAC1 and XAC2 to F - actin was measured at pH 6 . 8 and 8 . 0 by sedimentation and SDS - PAGE ( Hayden et al . , 1993 ) . Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blotting SDS - PAGE on 15 % polyacrylamide isocratic mini - slab gels , and two di - mensional gel eleetrophoresis on mini - slab gels was performed as de - scribed previously ( Bamburg et al . , 1991 ) . Nonequilibrium pH gradient electrophoresis ( NEpHGE ) ( O ' Farrell et al . , 1977 ) was used in the first di - mension . Electroblotting onto polyvinylidene difluoride ( PVDF ) membrane ( Immobilon P ; Millipore , Bedford , MA ) , blocking and immunostaining were performed as previously described ( Bamburg et at . , 1991 ) . Primary antibody was the hybridoma supernatant ( 1All or 2F10 ) to XAC or puri - fied antibodies to the XAC1 or XAC2 peptides . Alkaline phosphatase - conjugated goat anti - rat IgG or goat anti - rabbit IgG ( Life Technologies , Inc . ) was the secondary antibody . Chemiluminescent detection with Lu - miphos ( Boehringer Mannheim ) was followed by staining with nitroblue tetrazolium chloride ( NBT ) and 5 - bromo - 4 - chloro - 3 - indolylphosphate p - toluidine salt ( BCIP ) ( Life Technologies , Inc . ) . Spot densities from film or blots were obtained from scans in transmittance or reflectance modes , respectively , using a Microscan 2000 image analysis system ( Technology Resources Inc . , Knoxville , TN ) . Preparation of Embryos and Embryo Extracts X . laevis embryos ( wild type or albino ) were obtained by fertilizing eggs from females induced with human chorionic gonadotropin , dejellying , and Abe et al . ADF / Cofilin Is Essential for Xenopus Development 873 culturing in Steinberg ' s solution at room temperature ( Kay and Peng , 1991 ) . Staging was according to Nieuwkoop and Faber ( 1967 ) . Protein extracts were prepared from eggs , embryos , and adult tissues by lysing in 2 % SDS , 10 mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 , 20 mM NaF , 2 mM EGTA , 10 mM WIT ( 25 ixl per embryo ) , heating the lysate for 3 min in a boiling wa - ter bath , and precipitating the proteins with chloroform / methanol ( Wessel and Fliigge , 1984 ) . Proteins were redissolved in either SDS - sample prepa - ration buffer ( Laemmli , 1970 ) for SDS - PAGE or in urea lysis buffer ( O ' Farrell , 1975 ) for NEpHGE . Fixation of Embryos For in situ hybridization or immunocytochemistry Xenopus embryos were fixed in 0 . 1 M MOPS , pH 7 . 4 , 2 mM EGTA , 1 mM MgSO4 , 3 . 7 % formal - dehyde for 1 h at room temperature and then in 70 % ethanol ( 3× 30 rain ) ( Harland , 1991 ) . The same fixative containing 2 % trichloroacetic acid was used to fix antibody injected embryos for 2 h before ethanol dehydration . For in situ hybridization embryos were stored at this stage . For immuno - cytochemistry , embryos were transferred to 100 % ethanol and stored . All fixation , labeling , and washing steps were carried out while the embryos were gently tumbling on a rotating mixer . In Situ Hybridization For in situ hybridization , digoxigenin - labeled single stranded RNA probes were prepared using the DIG RNA Labeling Kit ( Boehringer Mannheim ) after the manufacturer ' s procedures . The XAC1 and XAC2 cDNAs cloned into pBluescript KS - were linearized either with EcoR1 and tran - scribed with T7 polymerase to generate the sense probe or with HindIII and transcribed with T3 polymerase ( Toyobo , Japan ) to generate the anti - sense probe . In situ hybridization was done according to Harland ( 1991 ) except pre - hybridization was carried out with 5× SSPE ( 0 . 75 M NaC1 , 0 . 2 M NaH2PO4 , 5 . 5 mM EDTA , pH 7 . 4 ) substituted for the 5× SSC , and 20 % goat serum was used as a blocking agent . The alkaline phosphatase conju - gated anti - digoxigenin antibody ( Boehringer Mannheim , Indianapolis , IN ) was developed with NBT / BCIP as the chromogenic substrate for 1 - 3 h . Embryos were transferred to 100 % ethanol to stop the development and cleared in a 1 : 2 mixture of benzyl alcohol and benzyl benzoate for photog - raphy . Whole Mount Immunocytochemistry Fixed albino embryos were put back into 70 % ethanol for 1 h , PBS for 1 h , and 20 % goat serum in PBS for 1 h . Embryos were incubated in 2F10 hy - bridoma supernatant at 4°C overnight , rinsed and washed in PBS contain - ing 0 . 3 % Tween - 20 ( 3× 1 h ) . Incubation in secondary antibody ( alkaline phosphatase - conjugated goat anti - rat IgG ) diluted into 20 % goat serum in PBS was done at 4°C overnight . Embryos were then rinsed and washed in PBS containing 0 . 3 % Tween - 20 ( 3× 1 h ) and incubated in NBT / BCIP ( as for in situ hybridization ) for 10 - 30 min as color developed . The reac - tion was stopped by transferring the embryos to 70 % ethanol and then to 100 % ethanol . Embryos were cleared in a 1 : 2 mixture of benzyl alcohol and benzyl benzoate for photography . Sectioning and Immunofluorescence Fixed wild - type embryos in 100 % ethanol were embedded in paraffin and 5 - or 6 - p , m - thick sections cut and mounted on ovalbumin - coated slides . After blocking with 20 % goat serum in PBS for 1 h , sections were incu - bated with 2F10 hybridoma supernatant , rabbit antiserum to XAC1 , or rabbit antiserum to actin ( Iida and Yahara , 1986 ) for 1 h at room tempera - ture , and then with an appropriate fluorescein - labeled secondary anti - body . After each step the sections were rinsed and washed in PBS con - taining 0 . 3 % Tween - 20 ( 2× 30 min ) . Sections were mounted in PBS containing 1 mg / ml p - ethylenediamine and 90 % glycerol ( Johnson and de C . Nogueira Araujo , 1981 ) for fluorescence microscopy . Microscopy Stained albino embryos and microinjected embryos were examined using overhead illumination on a Zeiss Stemi 200 - C dissection microscope and photographed with Fujichrome film ( ASA100 ) . Phase contrast and immu - nofluorescence micrographs ( 8 - s exposures ) of Xenopus embryo sections were obtained on Kodak Tri - X film ( ASA 400 ) using a 16× fluorescence objective on a Zeiss Universal epifluorescence microscope . Photography and printing of immunoflnorescence micrographs were matched to those of preimmune ( or nouimmune ) controls ( for polyclonal antiserum ) or sec - ondary antibody alone ( for monoclonal antibodies ) . Since printing time was adjusted so that the controls gave black images , no control images are shown . Microinjection Studies For microinjection into fertilized eggs or one blastomere of two cell em - bryos , the GST - XAC1 was concentrated on a Centricon - 30 ( Amicon Corp . , Danvers , MA ) to 10 mg / ml and dialyzed against the injection buffer ( 2 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 5 , 88 mM NaCl , 1 mM KCI and 2 mM MgClz ) . The IgG fraction of the GST - XAC rabbit antiserum was purified on protein G - aga - rose , dialyzed in phosphate buffered saline , freeze dried , dissolved in wa - ter at 25 mg / ml and dialyzed against injection buffer . It was diluted to 7 - 15 mg / ml for microinjection . A neutralized IgG fraction was prepared by mixing one part of the IgG ( 25 mg / ml ) with four parts of the GST - XAC ( 10 mg / ml ) , freeze drying , and dissolving in water to a final IgG concentra - tion of 10 mg / ml .

( C ) Depolymerization of F - actin ( 3 Ixg ) by GST - XAC1 ( I ) and GST - XAC2 ( A ) were compared to recombinant chick cofilin ( @ ) by measuring the amount of G - actin released using the DNase I inhibition assay . The DNase I was calibrated using muscle G - actin . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 132 , 1996 874 pipette from a pressure injector were calibrated by measuring the volume of an aqueous drop delivered into mineral oil . Control injections with nonimmune IgG ( 10 mg / ml ) were also done . Development of embryos , along with untreated controls , were followed for the times described in text . Results Two Embryonic cDNAs Encode Xenopus ADFICofilins Restriction mapping and partial sequencing of the 15 clones selected from a Xenopus stage 30 eDNA library screened with chicken ADF and cofilin cDNAs showed that the clones fell into two groups . One member of each group was sequenced completely . The two cDNAs ( Fig . 1 A ) , named XAC1 and XAC2 for Xenopus ADF / cofilin , are 85 % homologous with each other and are over 93 % homologous within the open reading frame . Each eDNA is 53 - 54 % and 51 % homologous to the cDNAs encoding chicken cofilin and ADF , respectively . Within the open reading frame the homologies of both XAC cDNAs are 69 and 65 % to cDNAs encoding chick cofilin and ADF , re - spectively . The proteins encoded by the open reading frame of XAC1 and XAC2 ( Fig . 1 ) are 93 % identical , dif - feting from each other in only 12 out of the 168 residues . The only nonconservative differences are pro / thr and ile / thr at residues 129 and 137 , respectively . Neither gives rise to any charge difference between the species . Both XAC proteins are 77 % identical to chicken cofilin and 66 % identical to chicken ADF ( Fig . 1 B ) . The molar extinction coefficient at 280 nm of 19 , 420 LM - 1 cm - 1 , calculated from the deduced amino acid sequences ( Gill and von Hippel , 1989 ) , is identical for the two proteins . Each cDNA was expressed in E . coli as a fusion protein with glutathione - S - transferase ( GST ) and purified in a sin - gle step on a glutathione column ( Fig . 2 A ) . Because the GST - XAC chimeric proteins have identical mobility on SDS - PAGE with actin , we first cleaved the GST chimeras with thrombin ( Fig . 2 B ) to measure binding of the ex - pressed XACs to F - actin . At pH 6 . 8 , both XAC1 and XAC2 primarily bound to and sedimented with F - actin , while at pH 8 . 0 both proteins primarily were in the super - natant along with an increased amount of unpolymerized actin . The GST released by thrombin remained in the su - Figure 3 . ( A ) Southern blots of Xenopus ge - nomic DNA hybridized to XAC1 and XAC2 3 ' UTR DNA probes ( see Fig . 1 ) .

Positions of 18 S and 28 S ribosomal RNA re - mained constant across the gel ( visualized by ethidium bromide staining ) while those of the XAC mRNAs decreased to the adult sizes . Identical results were obtained using the 3 ' UTR DNA probes ( not shown ) . Lanes $ 9 - $ 28 were from a separate gel ( longer expo - sure ) that also contained oocyte RNA and were aligned accordingly . Because of the overlap in the signal with the rRNA bands before stage 9 , it is not possible to conclude from this gel alone that the signals are spe - cific . However , immunoblotting and immuno - fluorescence staining reported below support the early expression seen here . ( C ) Northern blot of total RNA ( 13 Ixg ) from adult tissues hybridized to 3 ' UTR DNA probes of XAC1 ( left ) and XAC2 ( right ) . Ethidium bromide staining ( not shown ) was used to verify that similar amounts of RNA were loaded per lane . These results demonstrate both the specificity of probe hybridization to the 4 . 5 - kb mRNA , and the difference in size of the smaller mRNA between oocyte and adult .

ADF / Cofilin ls Essential for Xenopus Development 875 pernatant at both pHs . The uncleaved chimeric proteins had similar F - actin depolymerizing activity to recombinant chick ADF or cofilin when assayed at pH 8 . 0 and ex - pressed as G - actin released per ADF / cofilin equivalent ( Fig . 2 C ) . Two Embryonic cDNAs Probably Represent Allele Variants The high homology within the coding region of the two XAC cDNAs precluded using the whole cDNAs as probes to distinguish between the 2 XAC genes and 2 mRNAs . The greatest differences between the two XAC cDNAs occur in the 3 ' UTR , so probes were prepared encompass - ing bases 906 - 1482 for XAC1 and 1055 - 1507 for XAC2 . Southern blots ( both single and double digests ) of Xeno - pus genomic DNA ( Fig . 3 A ) show the XAC2 probe could be made specific for the XAC2 gene . However , the XAC1 probe always cross - hybridized to the XAC2 gene ( Fig . 3 A ) . Nevertheless , it is clear that each XAC cDNA arises from a separate gene . Northern blots of total RNA extracted from different stages of developing embryo ( Fig . 3 B ) and from adult tis - sues ( Fig . 3 C ) showed identical patterns when hybridized to either the specific XAC2 probe or the cross - reactive XAC1 probe , suggesting that both XAC mRNAs are co - ordinately expressed . Levels of XAC mRNA of 1 . 8 kb were high in brain , heart , oocyte , stomach and low in skel - etal muscle , mRNAs of 2 . 5 kb and 4 . 5 kb were identified in oocytes by hybridization to either XAC probe . These migrated nearly identically to 18 and 28 S rRNA until stage 9 . The 4 . 5 - kb species was not found in adult tissues . The maternal 2 . 5 - kb species was gradually replaced by a 1 . 8 - kb size ( the adult tissue size ) between the morula and tadpole ( stages 5 to 34 ) . The same 3 ' - UTR region of each XAC cDNA used for probing Southern and Northern blots was used to generate digoxigenin - labeled antisense riboprobes to examine the distribution of the mRNAs during Xenopus development by in situ hybridization ( Fig . 4 ) . Sense riboprobes were used as controls . Both XAC mRNAs are concentrated at the anterior end and along the dorsal side of the develop - ing embryo . Nerve tissue , including the brachial arches , neural plate , neural tube , and retina , show particularly high expression . The protruding cement gland , visible af - ter stage 26 , does not contain XAC mRNA , but the cell bodies which generate this neurite rich region stain brightly for XAC protein ( see below ) . To distinguish between the XAC1 and XAC2 proteins , specific antibodies ( Table I ) were raised to KLH - conju - gated synthetic decapeptides from the region of the two species ( residues 124 - 133 ) with the greatest sequence dif - ferences ( Fig . 1 B ) . Antiserum to the peptide from XAC1 cross - reacted with GST - XAC2 , but could be made specific for XAC1 by using antibodies isolated on an XACl - pep - tide affinity column and by washing immunoblots in 0 . 4 M MgC12 for 5 min after the primary incubation step , to dis - sociate weak complexes ( Fig . 5 A ) . Antiserum to XAC2 did not cross - react with GST - XAC1 , but it did cross - react with several other proteins in Xenopus tissue extracts . This nonspecific cross - reactivity could be reduced , but not eliminated , by immunoabsorbing the antiserum with KLH Figure 4 . In situ hybridization of Xenopus embryos with XAC ri - boprobes . Identical patterns of expression were observed with the specific probe to the 3 ' UTR of XAC2 and with the coding re - gion probe to XAC2 ( cross - reacts with XAC1 gene fragments on Southern blots ) . The anti - sense RNA probe used for a , b , d , e , and fis from the XAC2 coding region , while the XAC1 3 ' UTR probe was used for c ( the dorsal view ) . Controls ( g - k ) use the sense RNA probes made against the coding region of XAC2 . De - velopmental stages shown : 15 / 16 ( a and g ) ; 21 ( b , c , and h ) ; 26 ( d and i ) ; 32 ( e and j ) ; 36 ( fand k ) . The development of the reaction product was stopped quickly to show the regions that contained particularly high levels of the XAC mRNA . It is difficult to dif - ferentiate specific regions within the head from these studies , but immunofluorescence localization of the XAC was done on verti - cal sections through the anterior end of the embryo ( see below ) . ( 1 mg / 200 t ~ 1 serum ) and purifying the antibodies on an XAC2 - peptide affinity column ( Fig . 5 A ) . Because of re - sidual nonspecific cross - reactivity with other proteins , im - munostaining of a band of the correct molecular size for XAC cannot be unambiguously interpreted as indicating The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 132 , 1996 876 Table L Characterization of the Different XA C Antibodies Used Here Polyclonal ( PC ) Used in Antigen Animal Name or monoctonal ( M ) Specificity figure no .

However , the lack of staining is a good indication that XAC2 is not present . Western blots of extracts from different stages of developing embryos ( Fig . 5 B ) and mature frog tissues ( Fig . 5 C ) strongly sug - gest that the two isoforms are coordinately expressed . Nei - ther XAC1 nor XAC2 was detected in extracts of skeletal muscle or lung , suggesting they have the same tissue spe - cific distribution . Taken together , these results strongly suggest that XAC1 and XAC2 are allelic variants . Immunocytochemical Localization of XA C during Development The cross - reactivity of the peptide - specific polyclonal anti - bodies with other Xenopus proteins precluded their use in immunocytochemistry . Therefore , monoclonal antibodies were prepared by immunizing a rat with the recombinant GST - XAC2 chimera and fusing the rat lymph node cells with mouse myeloma cells . Two clones were eventually es - tablished which recognized epitopes in common between XAC1 and XAC2 . One clone , 2F10 , required conditioned medium and IL - 6 supplementation for growth but it pro - duced antibodies highly specific for XAC in tissue extracts ( Fig . 5 D ) . The second clone , 1All , grew well without special supplements and produced antibodies which also recog - nized XAC1 and 2 , but these antibodies also cross - reacted weakly with other proteins in Xenopus brain extracts ( Fig . 5 D ) . This latter hybridoma line produced antibodies use - ful for immunoblot analysis but not for immunocytochem - istry . In addition , a rabbit antiserum was also raised against the GST - XAC1 and the IgG fraction was purified on pro - tein A - agarose . This IgG was specific for XAC ( both forms ) in tissue extracts ( Fig . 5 D ) . This IgG was used below for embryo injection studies . X . laevis eggs and embryos , fixed at various stages of development , were immunostained for XAC using the specific monoclonal antibody , 2F10 . Immunofluorescent localizations of XAC and actin in 5 p ~ m sections of oocytes , unfertilized eggs , and zygotes are shown in Fig . 6 A . XAC staining is diffuse in the cortical cytoplasm of oocytes in both the animal and vegetal hemispheres ( Fig . 6 , A - b and c ) . In the unfertilized eggs there is increased immunofluores - cence associated with the membrane , particularly in the vegetal hemisphere ( Fig . 6 , A - e and J0 , although most staining is still diffuse . Sections from different unfertilized eggs showed the largest variability in XAC distribution , perhaps related to the variability observed in XAC phos - phorylation state ( see below ) . 30 min after fertilization ( Fig . 6 , A - h and i ) there is enhanced immunostaining of the membrane , especially in the vegetal hemisphere , at re - gions where actin immunofluorescence is also strong ( Fig . 6 , A - k and l ) . Immunofluorescence also is brighter at the junction between the cortical cytoplasm and the animal hemisphere cytoplasm ( Fig . 6 A - h ) . 1 h after fertilization ( before first cleavage ) the staining for XAC at the junction between cortical cytoplasm and animal hemisphere cyto - plasm is even more pronounced ( Fig . 6 B - b ) . Actin stain - ing is reduced in the cortical cytoplasm ( Fig . 6 , B - e and f ) and brighter in the animal hemisphere cytoplasm ( Fig . 6 B - e ) at this stage . Early in the first cleavage , XAC staining accumulates around the cleavage furrow ( Fig . 6 B - h ) and along the vegetal membrane ( Fig . 6 B - i ) . Actin immuno - fluorescence is bright in both these regions as well ( Fig . 6 , B - k and / ) . Late in first cleavage , XAC immunofluores - cence is found in the midbody structure ( Fig . 6 , C - a and b ) , staining deeper in the furrow than the bulk of the actin ( Fig . 6 , C - c and d ) . Staining of this midbody structure for XAC but not actin persists through the end of first cleav - age ( Fig . 6 , C - e and 3 ' ) . Identical results for XAC distribu - tion were obtained using the XAC polyclonal antibody ( not shown ) . Whole mount immunoehemical staining of albino Xeno - pus embryos for XAC shows staining at the boundary of the blastomeres where cleavage from the two cell to the four cell stage is going to occur ( Fig . 7 a ) or around the boundary of the cells after the 8 cell stage ( Fig . 7 b ) . In these specimens , development of the alkaline phosphatase reaction product was stopped at an early stage to allow the visualization of regions of highest concentration . Controls ( second antibody alone ) showed no staining ( not shown ) . At the blastula stage , cells on the animal sphere were strongly stained and most cells , except those of the yolk plug , were highly positive during gastrulation ( not shown ) . Staining was found in most tissues of the stage 38 embryo with the heaviest staining in the nervous system and retina ( Fig . 7 c ) . Controls ( secondary antibody alone - - not shown ) looked virtually identical to those from the in situ hybrid - ization experiment ( Fig . 4 k ) . Additional immunofluorescence staining for XAC with the monoclonal antibody 2F10 was done on sections from embryos at stage 17 , 24 , and 34 . By stage 17 ( Fig . 7 d ) , the XAC is concentrated in cells of the developing neuroecto - derm . Cells within the notochord , neural tube , neural crest , somites , and around the lumen of the archenteron , as well as a layer of cells in the archenteron , stain very brightly for XAC at stage 24 ( Fig . 7 , e and f ) . By stage 34 , staining intensity had declined in the notochord , but the neural tube , epidermis and a layer of cells in the arch - enteron stain brightly ( Fig . 7 g ) . A more anterior vertical section of the same stage embryo ( Fig . 7 h ) shows very bright staining throughout the developing retina , and in the cell bodies of the neurons at the base of the cement gland which are also derived from neuroectoderm . Immu - nofluorescence in the micrographs shown has been ad - justed to correct for background staining with secondary antibody alone ( black image ) .

A more anterior vertical section through a stage 34 embryo ( h ) shows intense staining of the neural tube , cells within the developing retina ( R ) and the neuronal cell bodies which constitute the base of the cement gland ( C ) . Immunofluorescent controls ( secondary antibody only ) for sections of oocyte and embryos were black ( not shown ) . noreactive species , with mobilities similar to phosphory - lated and dephosphorylated forms of chicken ADF ( Mor - gan et al . , 1993 ) . The more acidic species in the Xenopus embryonic extract ( pXAC ) is converted to the dephosphor - ylated form by treatment with alkaline phosphatase ( Fig . 8 A ) . Two dimensional immunoblots of extracts from em - bryos at different stages of development from a single batch of fertilized eggs show a rapid dephosphorylation of pXAC occurs after fertilization ( Fig . 8 B ) . A systematic analysis of these changes during development ( Fig . 8 C ) shows that oocytes , surgically removed from the adult , contained only pXAC . In unfertilized eggs , pXAC com - The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 132 , 1996 880 pXAC increases again in abundance between the morula and blastula stages ( 5 - 8 h postfertilization ) , and then de - creases again as gastrulation is approached ( ~ 12 h ) . Microinjection of Anti - XAC IgG and GST - XA C Inhibits Cytokinesis Injection of anti - XAC IgG into one blastomere of em - bryos at the 2 cell stage inhibited cleavage of the injected blastomere ( Fig . 9 a ) .

During the first few hours of development , when division is synchronous , vari - ability was seen between embryos , especially between those collected on different days . Since the rate of early development is very temperature dependent , the variabil - ity in the phosphorylation state of XAC may reflect changes which occur during the cell cycle . Such changes are suggested by studies on a single batch of fertilized eggs ( Fig . 8 B ) which show the initial dephosphorylation of pXAC is followed by rephosphorylation at 3 h . When divi - sion synchrony is lost , variability in pXAC content be - tween individual embryos decreases . In pooled embryos , Figure 9 . Inhibition of XAC with antibody or introduction of con - stitutively active GST - XAC inhibits cleavage of Xenopus em - bryos .

Normal development ( to gastrula stage ) occurred in 84 % ( 58 / 69 ) of blastomeres injected with anti - XAC IgG ( 20 nl of 10 mg / ml ) , neutralized before injection with an excess of GST - XAC ( Fig . 9 b ) , and in 75 % of em - bryos injected with nonimmune IgG at 10 mg / ml . Nuclear division was not inhibited in the cleavage deficient blas - tomere ( Fig . 9 c ) . Both lobed cleavage nuclei ( Fig . 9 d ) and asters ( Fig . 9 e ) were observed suggesting that XAC is not required for karyokinesis . Cleavage was also blocked in 68 % ( 23 / 34 ) of blas - tomeres injected with GST - XAC ( 5 mg / ml ; 20 nl ) ( Fig . 10 a ) . Since cytokinesis seemed to be blocked by either too much or too little XAC activity , we injected eggs undergoing the first cleavage with the GST - XAC to see what effect this had on furrow formation . Eggs injected with buffer alone completed cleavage normally whereas those injected with GST - XAC underwent regression of the cleavage furrow ( Fig . 10 b ) . Paraffin sections of eggs in which the cleavage furrow disappeared after GST - XAC injection sometimes showed regions of reduced pigment density at the mem - brane where the furrow had originally formed ( Fig . 10 , c and e ) and pigment granules were deposited deeper within the cytoplasm . Actin staining was diffuse in the cortex above the deposited pigment granules ( Fig . 10 d ) . Other Figure 10 .

( f ) Immu - nofluorescence staining of XAC ( using 2F10 monoclonal anti - body ) of the same section of regressed furrow shown in e . The XAC is also diffuse in the cortex of the injected egg . injected eggs showed pigment both at the surface and de - posited in the regressed furrow ( Fig . 10 e ) with strong im - munofluorescence staining of the XAC in the cortex ( Fig . 10 jr ) . These results suggest that XAC is needed to form the cleavage furrow , but that excess active XAC destroys the contractile ring . Injection of chick brain ADF ( 3 mg / ml ) into eggs did not inhibit development ( not shown ) suggesting that the GST - XAC , unlike brain ADF , is unable to be inactivated by phosphorylation . This was examined directly by injecting eggs with brain ADF or GST - XAC1 , and , after 1 h , ex - tracting the proteins for analysis by 2D immunoblotting . One part of the sample was treated with alkaline phos - phatase before running the 2D gels . Brain ADF was phos - phorylated and the pADF disappeared after phosphatase treatment ( not shown ) . The position of recombinant GST - XAC1 , visualized with the 1All antibody ( Fig . 11 a ) , was not altered by injection into fertilized eggs ( Fig . 11 b ) . Fur - thermore , no change in the pattern of staining of the GST - XAC was observed after alkaline phosphatase treatment under conditions which completely dephosphorylated all of the endogenous pXAC ( Fig . 11 c ) . Thus , the GST - XAC is not susceptible to phosphorylation in vivo and , there - fore , serves as a constitutively active form of XAC . Discussion Results clearly demonstrate that the two Xenopus cDNAs we have cloned and expressed represent members of the ADF / cofilin family of proteins . Although these proteins have a greater similarity in sequence to other vertebrate cofilins than to vertebrate ADFs , we have elected to refer to them by the family name , Xenopus ADF / cofilin ( XAC ) . This name is more descriptive of the two activities shared by all of the vertebrate proteins in this family , i . e . , the abil - ity to depolymerize F - actin and the ability to bind to , and cosediment with , F - actin in a pH - dependent manner ( Bam - burg et al . , 1980 ; Nishida et al . , 1984 ; Yonezawa et al . , 1985 ; Hayden et al . , 1993 ; Hawkins et al . , 1993 ) . Although XAC1 and XAC2 arise from different genes , they have a high degree of sequence homology both within and outside of the coding region . Results from Northern blots , in situ hybridization , and Western blots indicate that both XAC1 and XAC2 are expressed in the same tissues and at the same time during development . Taken together , these results strongly suggest that XAC1 and XAC2 are allelic variants , probably arising from the pseudotetraploid state of X . laevis , estimated to have arisen about 30 million years ago ( Bisbee et al . , 1977 ) . The adult tissue distributions of these XACs are similar , but not identical , to that found for chicken ADF ( Barn - burg and Bray , 1987 ) . For instance , high amounts of these proteins are found in nerve tissue ( brain and spinal cord ) , intestine , and liver from adult frog and chicken , and the proteins are not detectable in extracts of adult skeletal muscle from either animal . On the other hand , lung tissue from adult chicken contained ADF , but XAC was not de - tectable in Xenopus lung , and adult chicken cardiac mus - cle did not contain significant amounts of ADF , whereas protein and RNA extracts of Xenopus cardiac muscle gave strong XAC bands on Western and Northern blots , re - spectively . The significance of these differences is not The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 132 , 1996 882 Figure 11 . GST - XAC is not phosphorylated in Xenopus eggs . Fertilized eggs were mi - croinjected with GST - XAC1 ( 4 mg / ml ; 30 nl ] egg ) and 1 h later the eggs were extracted , proteins precipitated , and half of the sample treated with alkaline phosphatase as described in Materials and Methods . Samples and a stan - dard of uninjected protein were separated by 2D gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted using the 1All monoclonal antibody to XAC . ( a ) Recombinant GST - XAC1 before injection . ( b ) Extracts from eggs injected with GST - XAC1 show the two endogenous XAC species ( pXAC and XAC ) and a single spot of 45 kD for GST - XAC1 . ( c ) Alkaline phosphatase treatment of this extract completely converted the endogenous pXAC to XAC , but the position of the GST - XAC1 did not change . known at this time , but it is possible that other isoforms of these proteins ( Ono et al . , 1994 ) are present in different adult tissues . XACs are encoded by maternal mRNAs , which suggests that these proteins have important roles in early embry - onic development . The diffuse cytoplasmic distribution of the XAC in the oocyte is consistent with its presence in an inactive ( phosphorylated ) form . In the unfertilized egg , in which ~ 20 % of the XAC is in the unphosphorylated state , there is a clear localization of some of the XAC to the membrane , especially that of the vegetal hemisphere . Af - ter fertilization , a rapid decline in the level of pXAC oc - curs which correlates with an increased localization of the XAC to the membrane , particularly in the vegetal hemi - sphere , and to the junction between the cortical cytoplasm and the cytoplasm of the animal hemisphere . This relocal - ization precedes cortical rotation , which defines the dor - sal / ventral axis of the developing embryo ( Vincent et al . , 1986 ; Vincent and Gerhart , 1987 ) . Pharmacological studies on Xenopus oocytes have suggested that cortical rotation is restricted by actin filaments and is dependent upon mi - crotubules ( Manes et al . , 1978 ) , although the exact mecha - nism of the phenomenon has not yet been elucidated . If actin filaments are involved in restricting the cortical rota - tion , the localization of the XAC to the interface between the cortical and animal hemisphere cytoplasm suggests that it may play a role in the breakdown of the actin fila - ments , and that its correct temporal activation after fertili - zation is what regulates the timing of the rotation . Such a role would be important in establishing the dorsal / ventral axis in amphibian embryos . Direct experiments to test this hypothesis are in progress . The localization of the XAC in the cleavage furrow and midbody structure of dividing Xenopus cells is not surpris - ing in view of the recent localization of cofilin in the cleav - age furrow of mammalian cells undergoing cytokinesis ( Nagaoka et al . , 1995 ) . The finding that XAC is found deeper within the furrow than the bulk of the actin sug - gests that XAC associates with a subset of F - actin ( for re - view see Fishkind and Wang , 1995 ) , possibly filaments which do not contain tropomyosin , a known inhibitor of ADF ( Bernstein and Bamburg , 1982 ; Bamburg and Bern - stein , 1991 ) and cofilin ( Nishida et al . , 1984 ) . It has been proposed ( Nagaoka et al . , 1995 ) that the late arrival of the mammalian cofilin into the cleavage furrow accompanies the disassembly of actin filaments in the contractile ring , which occurs as cytokinesis progresses ( Singal and San - ders , 1974 ) . Such a role would be consistent with the ef - fects of constitutively active XAC ( e . g . , GST - XAC ) , which in excess is able to destroy the contractile ring and cause cleavage furrow regression . Embryos injected with chick brain ADF ( Verrastro , T . A . , M . D . Brown , and J . R . Bam - burg , unpublished results ) appear to be able to handle the higher levels by inactivating the protein by phosphoryla - tion . However , GST - XAC is not phosphorylated in vivo , which suggests that cell cycle regulation of XAC activity by phosphorylation may control the reorganization of ac - tin involved in cytokinesis . Alterations in XAC phosphor - ylation during the cell cycle may also explain the variability seen in the amount of pXAC in individual embryos , since progression through the cell cycle was timed from sperm addition and fertilization is not instantaneous . The varia - tion in pXAC levels observed between individual eggs could also arise from differential mechanical effects of the dejellying procedure . It was surprising to find that the GST - chimeric con - structs with XAC have full F - actin depolymerizing activ - ity . GST , a protein of N26 kD , is on the NH2 terminus of the XAC . The position of the regulatory phosphorylation site in mammalian ADF / cofilins is Ser 3 in the encoded proteins ( Agnew et al . , 1995 ; Moriyama et al . , 1996 ) . One might expect that such a large NH2 - terminal extension would perturb the structure at least as dramatically as the addition of a phosphate group to Ser 3 . The fact that these proteins have full activity in vitro suggests that chimeric constructs of the XAC with the 25 - kD green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) ( Chalfle et al . , 1992 ) , could prove useful in examining the localization of active XAC in vivo . How - ever , since we show that XAC with such an NH2 - terminal extension is not recognized by the endogenous kinase , it will not be regulated normally in vivo . The modulation of activity of vertebrate ADF / cofilins by phosphorylation has been established as a major in vivo regulatory mechanism ( Morgan et al . , 1993 ; Agnew et al . , 1995 ) . The phosphorylated isoform is inactive in binding to monomeric actin or depolymerizing F - actin ( Morgan et al . , 1993 ) . In astrocytes ( Baorto et al . , 1992 ) , thyroid ceils ( Saito et al . , 1994 ) , platelets ( Davidson and Haslam , 1994 ) , T - lymphocytes ( Samstag et al . , 1994 ) , and neutrophils ( Su - zuki et al . , 1995 ) , dephosphorylation of ADF / cofilin ac - Abe et al . ADF / Cofilin Is Essential for Xenopus Development 883 companies dramatic changes in the actin cytoskeleton im - portant for cellular function ( for review see Moon and Drubin , 1995 ) . Here we show that phosphorylation control of XAC activity occurs during early embryonic develop - ment as well . Since the inactivation of XAC in eggs with antibody prevents cytokinesis , the activation of XAC by dephosphorylation which follows fertilization is a critical step in early Xenopus development . Although the XACs appear to be widely distributed within the embryo after gastrulation , their very high con - centration within the neuroectoderm and continued pres - ence in neural tissues suggest they play an important role in neurogenesis . In vertebrate neurons , proteins in the ADF / cofilin family are found enriched in growth cones of both axons and dendrites both in vivo ( IAna et al . , 1991 ) and in vitro ( Bamburg and Bray , 1987 ) . These proteins ap - pear earlier in development and with a broader neuronal distribution than has been found for the actin monomer - binding peptide , thymosin 134 ( Yamamoto et al . , 1994 ) , al - though there may be other low molecular weight actin - binding proteins in Xenopus cytoplasm ( Rosenblatt et al . , 1995 ) . The early expression and broad neuronal distribu - tion make the ADF / cofilin proteins likely regulators of the dynamic actin filaments involved in growth cone motility , pathfinding , and synaptogenesis . The Xenopus system of - fers an excellent experimental model in which to further examine their regulation and role in early development and neurogenesis .
