However , there is very little struc - 4 tural information deﬁning mitochondria - cytoskeleton inter - 5 faces in any cell type . Here , we use cryo - focused ion beam 6 milling - enabled cryo - electron tomography to image mam - 7 malian sperm , where mitochondria wrap around the ciliary 8 cytoskeleton . We ﬁnd that mitochondria are tethered to their 9 neighbors through inter - mitochondrial linkers and are an - 10 chored to the cytoskeleton through ordered arrays on the 11 outer mitochondrial membrane . We use subtomogram aver - 12 aging to resolve in - cell structures of these arrays from three 13 mammalian species , revealing they are conserved across 14 species despite variations in mitochondrial dimensions and 15 cristae organization . We ﬁnd that the arrays consist of 16 boat - shaped particles anchored on a network of membrane 17 pores whose arrangement and dimensions are consistent 18 with voltage dependent anion channels . Proteomics and in - 19 cell cross - linking mass spectrometry suggest that the con - 20 served arrays are composed of glycerol kinase - like proteins . 21 Ordered supramolecular assemblies may serve to stabilize 22 similar contact sites in other cell types where mitochondria 23 need to be immobilized in speciﬁc subcellular environments , 24 such as in muscles and neurons . 25 sperm | mitochondria - cytoskeleton contact | cryo - electron tomography | cryo - 26 FIB milling | cross - linking mass spectrometry | subtomogram averaging 27 Introduction 28 In many cell types , mitochondria collectively form a dy - 29 namic network whose members divide , fuse , and commu - 30 nicate with one another ( Glancy et al . , 2015 ; Viana et al . , 31 2020 ; Vincent et al . , 2017 ) . Through interactions with the cy - 32 toskeleton , mitochondria are transported – sometimes across 33 large distances – and positioned in response to dynamic stim - 34 uli ( Fenton et al . , 2021 ; Moore and Holzbaur , 2018 ) . Inter - 35 actions with the cytoskeleton can also restrain mitochondria 36 to speciﬁc subcellular locations . In neurons , axonal mito - 37 chondria can be immobilized by interactions with the micro - 38 tubule or actin cytoskeletons ( Chen and Sheng , 2013 ; Gut - 39 nick et al . , 2019 ; Kang et al . , 2008 ) . In cardiac and skele - 40 tal muscle , mitochondrial distribution is regulated by inter - 41 actions with myoﬁbrils and intermediate ﬁlaments ( Milner et 42 al . , 2000 ; Stone et al . , 2007 ) . However , despite the preva - 43 lence of inter - mitochondria and mitochondria - cytoskeleton 44 interactions and their integral roles in cellular function , there 45 is very little information on the molecular architectures of 46 these interaction sites in any cell type . 47 One of the most striking mitochondrial conﬁgurations oc - 48 curs in amniote sperm , where mitochondria are arranged in a 49 spiral around the axoneme , deﬁning a region called the mid - 50 piece ( Fawcett , 1970 , 1975 ) . Mitochondria are among the 51 few organelles retained in sperm throughout their maturation , 52 during which they otherwise lose most of their cytoplasm and 53 organelles en route to becoming highly streamlined cells spe - 54 cialized for ﬁnding and fusing with the egg . The extensive 55 mitochondrial sheath in amniote sperm may be an adaptation 56 needed to power the large , long ﬂagellum in these lineages . 57 Variations in midpiece morphometry affect sperm motility 58 and competitiveness ( Firman and Simmons , 2010 ; Fisher et 59 al . , 2016 ) , and different species rely on energy from mito - 60 chondrial respiration to different extents ( Marin et al . , 2003 ; 61 Tourmente et al . , 2015 ) , warranting comparative studies of 62 mitochondrial structure across species . 63 The core of the midpiece is the ciliary cytoskeleton , 64 composed of the microtubule - based axoneme and acces - 65 sory elements called outer dense ﬁbers ( ODFs ) . A poorly - 66 characterized network of cytoskeletal ﬁlaments called the 67 submitochondrial reticulum lies between the ODFs and the 68 mitochondria . The submitochondrial reticulum co - puriﬁes 69 with the outer mitochondrial membrane ( OMM ) , suggesting 70 that they are intimately associated ( Olson and Winfrey , 1986 , 71 1990 ) . Mitochondria wrap around the cytoskeleton and are 72 in turn ensheathed by the plasma membrane . As a conse - 73 quence of this arrangement , each mitochondrion has three 74 distinct surfaces ( Olson and Winfrey , 1992 ) – one facing the 75 axoneme , one facing the plasma membrane , and one facing 76 neighboring mitochondria . Thin - section electron microscopy 77 ( EM ) ( Olson and Winfrey , 1992 ) and freeze - fracture EM 78 ( Friend and Heuser , 1981 ) suggest that each surface is char - 79 acterized by a unique membrane protein proﬁle . Notwith - 80 standing the insight gained from these methods , such tech - 81 niques require harsh sample preparation steps that can dis - 82 Leung et al . | February 12 , 2021 | 1 – 17 tort ﬁne cellular structure and limit achievable resolution ( Al - 83 Amoudi et al . , 2004 ) . As such , the molecular landscape of 84 inter - mitochondrial and mitochondrial - cytoskeleton contacts 85 in the sperm midpiece remains largely unexplored . 86 Assembly of the mitochondrial sheath occurs late in 87 spermiogenesis and involves an intricately choreographed se - 88 ries of events ( Ho and Wey , 2007 ; Otani et al . , 1988 ) . Ini - 89 tially , spherical mitochondria are broadly distributed in the 90 cytoplasm . Mitochondria are then recruited to the ﬂagellum , 91 where they form ordered rows along the ﬂagellar axis . Fi - 92 nally , mitochondria elongate and twist around the axoneme . 93 While our understanding of the molecular details of these 94 processes is cursory at best , studies on gene - disrupted mice 95 have implicated a number of proteins in mitochondrial sheath 96 morphogenesis . For instance , mice expressing mutant forms 97 of kinesin light chain 3 ( KLC3 ) have malformed midpieces , 98 hinting at a role for microtubule - based transport ( Zhang et 99 al . , 2012 ) . Another example are the voltage dependent anion 100 channels ( VDACs ) , which are highly abundant proteins that 101 mediate transport of metabolites , ions , and nucleotides like 102 ATP across the OMM ( Colombini , 2012 ) . Male mice lacking 103 VDAC3 are infertile and their sperm cells have disorganized 104 mitochondrial sheaths ( Sampson et al . , 2001 ) , so VDACs 105 may also have unappreciated roles in mitochondrial traf - 106 ﬁcking ; indeed , KLC3 binds mitochondria through VDAC2 107 ( Zhang et al . , 2012 ) . Similarly , disrupting sperm - speciﬁc iso - 108 forms of glycerol kinase leads to gaps in the mitochondrial 109 sheath despite proper initial alignment of spherical mitochon - 110 dria ( Chen et al . , 2017b ; Shimada et al . , 2019 ) . Mice lacking 111 spermatogenesis - associated protein 19 ( SPATA19 ) ( Mi et al . , 112 2015 ) or glutathione peroxidase 4 ( GPX4 ) ( Imai et al . , 2009 ; 113 Schneider et al . , 2009 ) also have structurally abnormal mito - 114 chondria . 115 Here , we use cryo - focused ion beam ( cryo - FIB ) milling - 116 enabled cryo - electron tomography ( cryo - ET ) to image the 117 mitochondrial sheath in mature sperm from three mammalian 118 species . We take advantage of the uniquely multi - scale 119 capabilities of cryo - ET to unveil new aspects both of the 120 overall organization of the mitochondrial sheath and of the 121 molecular structures important for its assembly . We ﬁnd 122 that mitochondria are tethered to their neighbors through 123 inter - mitochondrial linkers and to the underlying cytoskele - 124 ton through conserved protein arrays on the OMM . Subto - 125 mogram averaging revealed that these arrays are anchored 126 on a lattice of OMM pores whose arrangement and dimen - 127 sions are consistent with VDACs . Proteomics and in - cell 128 cross - linking mass spectrometry suggest that the arrays con - 129 sist of glycerol kinase ( GK ) - like proteins . Our data thus show 130 that although mitochondrial dimensions and cristae architec - 131 ture vary across species , the architecture of the mitochondria - 132 cytoskeleton interface is conserved at the molecular level . 133 Results 134 Mitochondrial dimensions and cristae organization 135 vary across species . We imaged the mitochondrial sheath 136 in mature sperm from three mammalian species , namely the 137 pig ( Sus scrofa ) , the horse ( Equus caballus ) , and the mouse 138 ( Mus musculus ) ( Fig . 1 ) . These species differ in terms of 139 sperm size , motility patterns , and metabolism . To visualize 140 the overall organization of the mitochondrial sheath , we im - 141 aged whole sperm with a Volta phase plate ( VPP ) ( Danev et 142 al . , 2014 ; Fukuda et al . , 2015 ) . Neural - network based seg - 143 mentation ( Chen et al . , 2017a ) of the mitochondrial mem - 144 brane allowed us to visualize mitochondrial organization in 145 three dimensions ( Fig . 1a - f ) . 146 To investigate variations in mitochondrial width along the 147 midpiece , we ﬁrst measured the width of each mitochondrion 148 at multiple points along its length . We then divided mito - 149 chondria into groups based on their positions along the mid - 150 piece , as measured by their distance from the head ( Fig . S1 ) . 151 The midpiece is ~ 10 µm long in both pig and horse sperm , 152 but ~ 20 µm long in mouse sperm , so each group represents 153 ~ 2 µm in the pig and the horse and ~ 4 µm in the mouse . We 154 found that mouse sperm mitochondria are ~ 1 . 5 times wider 155 than pig and horse sperm mitochondria overall ( Fig . S1a ) . 156 In all three species studied , most mitochondria in the mid - 157 dle ( ~ 60 % ) of the midpiece are crescent - shaped tubes ( Fig . 158 1d - f ) with consistent widths along their lengths ( Fig . S1b ) . 159 Mitochondria at the proximal end of the midpiece are larger 160 than their more distal counterparts ( Fig . 1a - c , S1a ) . More - 161 over , proximal mitochondria have more variable shapes , evi - 162 denced by greater variation in their widths at different point 163 along their lengths ( Fig . S1b ) . Because mitochondria wrap 164 around the axoneme , variations in mitochondrial dimensions 165 both across species and along the proximodistal axis of the 166 ﬂagellum affect the overall diameter and rigidity of the mid - 167 piece , likely ﬁne - tuning the hydrodynamics of sperm motil - 168 ity . 169 To visualize the internal organization of sperm mitochon - 170 dria in a near - native state , we imaged sperm thinned by cryo - 171 FIB milling ( Fig . 1g - l ) . This revealed unexpected diversity in 172 the internal ultrastructure of mitochondria across mammalian 173 species , especially in terms of cristae morphology . Horse 174 sperm mitochondria have an expanded intermembrane space 175 and a condensed matrix ( Fig . 1i - j ) . Mouse sperm mitochon - 176 dria have an expanded matrix , with a narrow intermembrane 177 space and thin cristae ( Fig . 1k - l ) . Pig sperm mitochondrial 178 morphology is intermediate ( Fig . 1g - h ) , and although the mi - 179 tochondrial matrix was dense , we could identify individual 180 complexes that resembled ATP synthase on cristae of FIB - 181 milled mitochondria ( Fig . S2a - b ) , which was conﬁrmed by 182 subtomogram averaging ( Fig . S2b’ ) . 183 Inter - species differences in cristae morphology correlate 184 with measurements of matrix volume relative to mitochon - 185 drial volume ( Fig . S2d ) . In this regard , horse sperm mito - 186 chondria resemble “condensed” mitochondria , which corre - 187 late with higher rates of oxidative activity in a number of 188 different cell types , including developing germ cells , neu - 189 rons , and liver ( Hackenbrock , 1968 ; De Martino et al . , 1979 ; 190 Perkins and Ellisman , 2011 ) . Indeed , horse sperm are de - 191 pendent on oxidative phosphorylation ( Davila et al . , 2016 ) , 192 whereas pig ( Marin et al . , 2003 ) and mouse sperm ( Mukai 193 and Okuno , 2004 ; Odet et al . , 2013 ) are thought to rely 194 largely on a glycolytic mechanisms . 195 2 | Leung et al . | supramolecular assemblies at the mitochondria - cytoskeleton interface Fig . 1 .

Scale bars : ( a - l ) left panels – 250 nm , ( g - l ) right panels – 100 nm . Inter - mitochondrial junctions are associated with 196 linker complexes . Mitochondria are closely packed within 197 the mitochondrial sheath , but it is unclear whether or how 198 individual organelles communicate with their neighbors . To 199 address this , we imaged inter - mitochondrial junctions cap - 200 tured in FIB - milled sperm lamellae . We observed trans - 201 mitochondrial cristae alignment in mouse sperm ( Fig . 1k - 202 l ) , but not in pig or in horse sperm ( Fig . 1g - j ) . Trans - 203 mitochondrial cristae alignment has also been observed in 204 muscle tissue of various organisms , and is proposed to medi - 205 ate electrochemical coupling between adjacent mitochondria 206 ( Picard et al . , 2015 ) . To our knowledge , this is the ﬁrst time 207 this phenomenon has been observed in mature sperm from 208 any lineage . It is particularly curious , however , that trans - 209 mitochondrial cristae alignment in sperm is species - speciﬁc . 210 We found that inter - mitochondrial junctions are charac - 211 terized by novel inter - mitochondrial linker complexes in all 212 three species ( arrowheads in Fig . 1g - l , Fig . S2c ) . These 213 inter - mitochondrial linkers span the 8 - nm distance between 214 the outer membranes of neighboring mitochondria . In mouse 215 sperm , these linkers are speciﬁcally associated with sites of 216 trans - mitochondrial cristae alignment ( Fig . 1k - l ) ; in the pig 217 and in the horse , they are positioned at regularly spaced 218 intervals along inter - mitochondrial junctions ( Fig . 1h - j ) . 219 Electron - dense inter - mitochondrial junctions were also seen 220 in cardiomyocytes by classical EM ( Duvert et al . , 1985 ; 221 Huang et al . , 2013 ; Picard et al . , 2015 ) . Thus , it is plausi - 222 ble that the as - yet - unidentiﬁed linker complexes we visual - 223 ize here represent a more general structural mechanism for 224 orchestrating inter - mitochondrial communication in various 225 cell types . 226 Ordered protein arrays at the mitochondria - cytoskele - 227 ton interface are conserved across species . To deter - 228 mine how mitochondria interact with the ﬂagellar cytoskele - 229 ton , we imaged the mitochondria - cytoskeleton interface in 230 cryo - FIB milled lamellae ( Fig . 2 ) . We found that the 231 axoneme - facing surface of the OMM is characterized by 232 an ordered protein array that is absent from the plasma 233 membrane - facing surface ( Fig . 2a ) . These arrays are present 234 Leung et al . | supramolecular assemblies at the mitochondria - cytoskeleton interface 3 Fig . 2 . Ordered protein arrays on the outer mitochondrial membrane directly interact with the submitochondrial reticulum . ( a ) Slice through a cryo - tomogram of a FIB - milled horse sperm midpiece , showing mitochondria ( mito ) , the submitochondrial reticulum ( smr ) outer dense ﬁbers ( odf ) , microtubule doublets ( mtd ) , and the central pair apparatus ( cpa ) .

Scale bars : ( a ) left – 250 nm , insets – 100 nm ; ( b , c ) 100 nm . in all three species and along the entire midpiece ( Fig . S3a - f ) 235 and resemble the particle rows seen on the axoneme - facing 236 surface of the OMM in guinea pig sperm ( Friend and Heuser , 237 1981 ) and in mouse sperm ( Woolley et al . , 2005 ) by freeze - 238 fracture EM . We observed direct interactions between the ar - 239 rays and cytoskeletal ﬁlaments surrounding the ODFs ( Fig . 240 2b - c ) , indicating that these arrays tether mitochondria to the 241 midpiece cytoskeleton . 242 We then aligned and averaged sub - volumes containing 243 the protein arrays and the underlying OMM ( Fig . 3 , Ta - 244 ble S1 ) . Our averages revealed ~ 22 - nm - long two - fold - 245 symmetric boat - shaped structures connected via four densi - 246 ties to a porous membrane ( Fig . 3 , Fig . S3g - i ) . Each boat - 247 shaped particle rises ~ 5 nm above the membrane and consists 248 of two tilde - shaped densities arranged end - to - end . The boat - 249 shaped structures form rows in which each particle is related 250 to its closest neighbors by a ~ 10 nm translation perpendicu - 251 lar to the particle long axis and a ~ 6 nm shift along this axis , 252 yielding a center - to - center spacing of ~ 12 nm ( Fig . 3d - f ) . 253 Each row is oriented ~ 120° to the long axis of the ﬂagellum 254 and adjacent rows are spaced ~ 12 nm apart , forming exten - 255 sive arrays on the axoneme - facing surface of the OMM ( Fig . 256 3g ) . Remarkably , the averages we obtained from the three 257 species were highly similar , both in terms of individual parti - 258 cle dimensions and in terms of their supramolecular arrange - 259 ment ( Fig . 3 , Fig . S3 ) . This conservation suggests that these 260 arrays are a crucial structural element of the mitochondrial 261 sheath . 262 Our averages revealed that the OMM underlying the pro - 263 tein arrays is studded with ~ 3 - 4 nm pores arranged in a 264 pseudo - lattice with a center - to - center spacing of ~ 5 nm . 265 ( Fig . 3a - c , Fig . S3g - i ) . These pore sizes are consistent 266 with the diameters of the voltage dependent anion channels 267 ( VDACs ) , which are known to form ordered arrays in the 268 4 | Leung et al . | supramolecular assemblies at the mitochondria - cytoskeleton interface Fig . 3 .

Subtomogram averages of boat - shaped particles are colored grey and plotted back into their positions and orientations in the tomogram . Right panel : Rotated and zoomed - in view of the axoneme - facing surface of a mitochondrion . The axoneme is oriented horizontally , so the ladder - like arrays are oriented ~ 120° to the ﬂagellar long axis , and individual particles within the array are oriented ~ 60° to this axis . Scale bars : ( a - c ) 10 nm . OMM ( Gonçalves et al . , 2007 ; Guo and Mannella , 1993 ; 269 Hoogenboom et al . , 2007 ; Mannella , 1982 ) . Indeed , our 270 label - free quantitative proteomics experiments show that the 271 most abundant OMM proteins in pig sperm are VDAC2 and 272 VDAC3 ( Table S2 ) . Furthermore , the lattice dimensions in 273 our averages closely match those of VDAC in puriﬁed Neu - 274 rospora OMM ( Guo and Mannella , 1993 ; Mannella , 1998 ) . 275 The lattice can be modeled by ﬁtting multiple copies of the 276 VDAC2 crystal structure ( Schredelseker et al . , 2014 ) ( Fig . 277 S4a ) . We oriented VDAC2 in the membrane plane based 278 on its known topology ( Bayrhuber et al . , 2008 ; Tomasello 279 et al . , 2013 ) ; however , at the current resolution , we cannot 280 determine the orientation around the pore axis . Thus , in our 281 model , each boat - shaped particle stretches across 8 VDAC 282 molecules ( Fig . 3 ) . 283 Leung et al . | supramolecular assemblies at the mitochondria - cytoskeleton interface 5 Fig . 4 .

( c ) The positions of cross - linked Lys residues ( red circles ) are consistent with GK and VDAC orientation assignments in our model . 6 | Leung et al . | supramolecular assemblies at the mitochondria - cytoskeleton interface Glycerol kinase - like proteins are probable con - 284 stituents of the conserved arrays at the mitochondria – 285 cytoskeleton interface . To search for possible constituents 286 of the protein arrays on the VDAC lattice , we used in - cell 287 cross - linking mass spectrometry ( XL - MS ) ( Fasci et al . , 2018 ; 288 Liu et al . , 2018 ) to ﬁnd potential VDAC2 / VDAC3 interac - 289 tion partners on the OMM ( Fig . 4 ) . We treated pig sperm 290 cells with the cross - linker disuccinimidyl sulfoxide ( DSSO ) , 291 which covalently links free lysines that are within ~ 3 nm 292 ( C α - C α ) of each other . To increase conﬁdence , we screened 293 for cross - links identiﬁed with at least two cross - link spectral 294 matches ( CSMs ) ( see Materials and Methods for details ) . 295 We ﬁrst screened candidate proteins based on their known 296 subcellular localizations ( Fig . 4a ) . VDAC2 / VDAC3 cross - 297 linked to mitochondria - associated proteins as well as to 298 sperm head - associated proteins . This is consistent with im - 299 munoﬂuorescence studies localizing VDAC2 / VDAC3 both to 300 the midpiece and to the acrosome , a large vesicle capping 301 the anterior sperm nucleus ( Hinsch et al . , 2004 ; Kwon et al . , 302 2013 ) . Of the proteins in the mitochondria - associated inter - 303 action hub , three proteins are particularly noteworthy because 304 they are known to localize to the OMM and because their 305 disruption results in dysplasia of the mitochondrial sheath : 306 spermatogenesis - associated protein 19 ( SPATA19 ) ( Mi et al . , 307 2015 ) , glutathione peroxidase 4 ( GPX4 ) ( Imai et al . , 2009 ; 308 Schneider et al . , 2009 ) , and glycerol kinase ( GK ) ( Chen et 309 al . , 2017b ; Shimada et al . , 2019 ) . 310 To distinguish among these candidates , we compared the 311 location of the cross - links with the known topology of VDAC 312 in the OMM ( Bayrhuber et al . , 2008 ; Tomasello et al . , 2013 ) . 313 GPX4 would interact on the side facing the intermembrane 314 space , whereas SPATA19 and GK would interact on the cy - 315 toplasmic face . Both SPATA19 and GK are highly abundant 316 ( Table S2 ) , as would be expected for proteins forming exten - 317 sive arrays . Assuming an average protein density of ~ 1 . 43 318 g / cm 3 ( Quillin and Matthews , 2000 ) , which corresponds to 319 ~ 0 . 861 Da / Å 3 , we estimate that each boat - shaped particle in 320 the array has a molecular weight of ~ 250 kDa . SPATA19 is 321 a small protein with an estimated molecular weight of ~ 18 322 kDa . To ﬁt into our EM densities , it must either be present 323 in multiple copies or form a complex with other proteins . In 324 contrast , GK has an estimated molecular weight of ~ 60 kDa 325 and is known to form S - shaped dimers ( ~ 120 kDa ) that are 326 conserved from bacteria ( Bystrom et al . , 1999 ; Fukuda et 327 al . , 2016 ) to eukaryotes ( Balogun et al . , 2019 ; Schnick et al . , 328 2009 ) . 329 To build a GK - VDAC model based on our subtomogram 330 average , we used rigid - body ﬁtting to place two GK dimers 331 end - to - end into a boat - shaped density ( Fig . S4b , Fig . 4b ) . 332 These ﬁts deﬁned a clear orientation for GK , with the N - 333 termini pointing upwards and the C - terminal helices facing 334 the OMM ( Fig . 4b ) . To validate our ﬁts , we mapped the 335 cross - linked lysines onto the resulting model ( Fig . 4c ) . All 336 cross - links were between the cytosolic face of VDAC2 and 337 the OMM - facing surface of GK , which is consistent with 338 the orientation expected from our ﬁts . Assigning GK - like 339 proteins as constituents of the ordered OMM arrays at the 340 mitochondria - cytoskeleton interface is also supported by re - 341 cent genetic studies . Sperm from mice lacking sperm - speciﬁc 342 GK isoforms , which do not show glycerol kinase activity 343 in vitro ( Pan et al . , 1999 ) , have disorganized mitochondrial 344 sheaths ( Chen et al . , 2017b ; Shimada et al . , 2019 ) . In these 345 mice , spherical mitochondria properly align along the ﬂagel - 346 lum but fail to properly elongate and coil around the ODFs 347 ( Shimada et al . , 2019 ) . This phenotype is consistent with our 348 data showing direct links between GK protein arrays and the 349 submitochondrial reticulum ( Fig . 2b - c ) . 350 Discussion 351 In this study , we used cryo - FIB milling - enabled cryo - 352 ET to image the sperm mitochondrial sheath in three mam - 353 malian species . Our data reveal that overall mitochondrial di - 354 mensions are remarkably consistent in sperm from the same 355 species ( Fig . 1 , S1 ) . This contrasts with other mitochondria - 356 rich tissues such as skeletal muscle , where there are massive 357 variations in mitochondrial size and morphology within indi - 358 vidual cells ( Vincent et al . , 2019 ) . In addition , we did not ob - 359 serve mitochondrial nanotunnels in any of the species we ex - 360 amined , in contrast to their relative abundance in muscle tis - 361 sue ( Vincent et al . , 2017 , 2019 ) . Our data also show that mi - 362 tochondrial dimensions and cristae architecture vary across 363 species ( Fig . 1 ) , providing possible structural bases for in - 364 terspeciﬁc differences in mitochondrial energetics . Further 365 comparative studies of how mitochondrial structure varies 366 with sperm metabolism will undoubtedly contribute to our 367 broader understanding of how mitochondrial form relates to 368 function . 369 Our data show that , despite this diversity , the molecular 370 underpinnings of mitochondrial sheath architecture are con - 371 served , at least in mammals . Speciﬁcally , we identiﬁed novel 372 inter - mitochondrial linkers that tether adjacent mitochondria 373 ( Fig . 1 , S2 ) and arrays of boat - shaped particles that anchor 374 mitochondria to the cytoskeleton ( Fig . 2 , 3 ) . In - cell subtomo - 375 gram averaging and in - cell XL - MS suggest that these arrays 376 consist of GK - like proteins anchored on VDAC lattices in the 377 OMM ( Fig . 4 ) . Given that VDACs are ubiquitous OMM pro - 378 teins , our ﬁndings motivate further efforts to explore whether 379 they also regulate mitochondria - cytoskeleton interactions in 380 other cell types . 381 The OMM arrays may function to regulate the precise 382 elongation and coiling of mitochondria , contributing to the 383 striking consistency within the mitochondrial sheath . In ma - 384 ture sperm , these arrays may help maintain the integrity of 385 mitochondria - cytoskeleton contacts , stabilizing them against 386 shear stresses during sperm motility and hyperactivation . 387 However , it is unclear what determines the organization of 388 these arrays in the ﬁrst place . Our averages do not hint at di - 389 rect interactions between boat - shaped particles . Instead , their 390 spacing may be deﬁned by the organization of the underlying 391 VDAC lattice . Another intriguing possibility is that the ar - 392 rays are organized by their cytoskeletal binding partners ; the 393 periodicity of relevant motifs on the submitochondrial retic - 394 ulum could dictate the spacing of the OMM arrays . 395 To our knowledge , this is the ﬁrst time such assemblies 396 Leung et al . | supramolecular assemblies at the mitochondria - cytoskeleton interface 7 have been visualized at any organelle - cytoskeleton interface 397 in any cell type . Deﬁning whether similar arrays are present 398 in other differentiated cell types – and whether they use a sim - 399 ilar pool of protein components – is an area ripe for study . In 400 striated muscle , proper mitochondrial positioning is critical 401 for muscle function and depends on direct associations be - 402 tween mitochondria and intermediate ﬁlaments ( Konieczny 403 et al . , 2008 ; Milner et al . , 2000 ) . Similarly , in skin cells , 404 mitochondrial organization depends on keratin ( Steen et al . , 405 2020 ) . The structural bases for these associations are un - 406 known , but cryo - ET and in - cell XL - MS may prove useful in 407 these contexts as well . 408 Acknowledgements 409 The authors thank Dr .

Pig sperm samples 444 were purchased from an artiﬁcial insemination company 445 ( Varkens KI Nederland ) , stored at 18°C , and prepared for 446 imaging within 1 day of delivery . Sperm were layered onto a 447 discontinuous gradient consisting of 4 mL of 35 % Percoll® 448 ( GE Healthcare ) underlaid with 2 mL of 70 % Percoll® , both 449 in HEPES - buffered saline ( HBS : 20 mM HEPES , 137 mM 450 NaCl , 10 mM glucose , 2 . 5 mM KCl , 0 . 1 % kanamycin , pH 451 7 . 6 ) and centrifuged at 750 g for 15 min at RT ( Harrison et 452 al . , 1993 ) . Pelleted cells were washed once in phosphate - 453 buffered saline ( PBS : 137 mM NaCl , 3 mM KCl , 8 mM 454 Na 2 HPO 4 , 1 . 5 mM KH 2 PO 4 , pH 7 . 4 ) , resuspended in PBS 455 and counted with a hemocytometer . 456 Horse semen was collected from mature Warmblood stal - 457 lions using a Hanover artiﬁcial vagina in the presence of a 458 teaser mare . After collection , semen was ﬁltered through 459 gauze to remove gel fraction and large debris , then trans - 460 ported to the laboratory at 37°C and kept at room tempera - 461 ture until further processing . Semen was diluted in INRA96 462 ( IMV Technologies ) to obtain a sperm concentration of 30 463 x 10 6 cells / mL . After this , sperm were centrifuged through 464 a discontinuous Percoll gradient as described above for pig 465 sperm for 10 min at 300 g followed by 10 min at 750 g ( Har - 466 rison et al . , 1993 ) . The remaining pellet was resuspended in 467 1 mL of PBS and centrifuged again for 5 min at 750 g . 468 Mouse sperm were collected from the cauda epididymis 469 of adult male C75BL / 6 mice as described in ( Hutcheon et 470 al . , 2017 ) . Brieﬂy , male mice were culled as described in 471 ( Mederacke et al . , 2015 ) and the cauda epididymides were 472 dissected with the vas deferens attached and placed in a 473 500 µL droplet of modiﬁed Biggers , Whitten , and Whitting - 474 ham media ( BWW : 20 mM HEPES , 91 . 5 mM NaCl , 4 . 6 475 mM KCl , 1 . 7 mM D - glucose , 0 . 27 mM sodium pyruvate , 476 44 mM sodium lactate , 5 U / mL penicillin , and 5 µg / mL 477 streptomycin , adjusted to pH 7 . 4 and an osmolarity of 300 478 mOsm / kg ) . To retrieve the mature cauda spermatozoa from 479 the epididymides , forceps were used to ﬁrst gently push the 480 stored sperm from the vas deferens , after which two incisions 481 were made with a razor blade in the cauda . Spermatozoa 482 were allowed to swim out of the cauda into the BWW over a 483 period of 15 min at 37°C , after which the tissue was removed 484 and sperm were loaded onto a 27 % Percoll density gradient 485 and washed by centrifugation at 400 g for 15 min . The pellet 486 consisting of an enriched sperm population was resuspended 487 in BWW and again centrifuged at 400 g for 2 min to remove 488 excess Percoll . 489 Cryo - EM grid preparation . Typically , 3 µL of a suspen - 490 sion containing either 2 - 3 x 10 6 cells / mL ( for whole cell to - 491 mography ) or 20 - 30 x 10 6 cells / mL ( for cryo - FIB milling ) 492 was pipetted onto a glow - discharged Quantifoil R 2 / 1 200 - 493 mesh holey carbon grid . One µL of a suspension of BSA - 494 conjugated gold beads ( Aurion ) was added , and the grids then 495 blotted manually from the back ( opposite the side of cell de - 496 position ) for ~ 3 s ( for whole cell tomography ) or for ~ 5 - 6 s 497 ( for cryo - FIB milling ) using a manual plunge - freezer ( MPI 498 Martinsreid ) . Grids were immediately plunged into a liquid 499 ethane - propane mix ( 37 % ethane ) ( Tivol et al . , 2008 ) cooled 500 to liquid nitrogen temperature . Grids were stored under liq - 501 uid nitrogen until imaging . 502 8 | Leung et al . | supramolecular assemblies at the mitochondria - cytoskeleton interface Cryo - focused ion beam milling . Grids were mounted into 503 modiﬁed Autogrids ( ThermoFisher ) for mechanical support . 504 Clipped grids were loaded into an Aquilos ( ThermoFisher ) 505 dual - beam cryo - focused ion beam / scanning electron micro - 506 scope ( cryo - FIB / SEM ) . All SEM imaging was performed at 507 2 kV and 13 pA , whereas FIB imaging for targeting was per - 508 formed at 30 kV and 10 pA . Milling was typically performed 509 with a stage tilt of 18° , so lamellae were inclined 11° rela - 510 tive to the grid . Each lamella was milled in four stages : an 511 initial rough mill at 1 nA beam current , an intermediate mill 512 at 300 pA , a ﬁne mill at 100 pA , and a polishing step at 30 513 pA . Lamellae were milled with the wedge pre - milling tech - 514 nique described in ( Schaffer et al . , 2017 ) and with expansion 515 segments as described in ( Wolff et al . , 2019 ) . 516 Tilt series acquisition . Tilt series were acquired on ei - 517 ther a Talos Arctica ( ThermoFisher ) operating at 200 kV 518 or a Titan Krios ( ThermoFisher ) operating at 300 kV , both 519 equipped with a post - column energy ﬁlter ( Gatan ) in zero - 520 loss imaging mode with a 20 - eV energy - selecting slit . All 521 images were recorded on a K2 Summit direct electron detec - 522 tor ( Gatan ) in either counting or super - resolution mode with 523 dose - fractionation . Tilt series were collected using SerialEM 524 ( Mastronarde , 2005 ) at a target defocus of between - 4 and - 6 525 µm ( conventional defocus - contrast ) or between - 0 . 5 and - 1 . 5 526 µm ( for tilt series acquired with the Volta phase plate ) . Tilt 527 series were typically recorded using either strict or grouped 528 dose - symmetric schemes , either spanning ± 56° in 2° incre - 529 ments or ± 54° in 3° increments , with total dose limited to 530 ~ 100 e - / Å 2 . 531 Tomogram reconstruction . Frames were aligned either 532 post - acquisition using Motioncor2 1 . 2 . 1 ( Zheng et al . , 2017 ) 533 or on - the - ﬂy using Warp ( Tegunov and Cramer , 2019 ) . 534 Frames were usually collected in counting mode ; when 535 super - resolution frames were used , they were binned 2X dur - 536 ing motion correction . Tomograms were reconstructed in 537 IMOD ( Kremer et al . , 1996 ) using weighted back - projection , 538 with a SIRT - like ﬁlter ( Zeng , 2012 ) applied for visualization 539 and segmentation . Defocus - contrast tomograms were CTF - 540 corrected in IMOD using ctfphaseﬂip while VPP tomograms 541 were left uncorrected . 542 Tomogram segmentation . Segmentation was generally 543 performed semi - automatically using the neural network - 544 based workﬂow implemented in the TomoSeg package in 545 EMAN 2 . 21 ( Chen et al . , 2017 ) . Microtubules , however , 546 were traced manually in IMOD . Segmentation was then man - 547 ually reﬁned in Chimera 1 . 12 ( Pettersen et al . , 2004 ) or in 548 ChimeraX ( Goddard et al . , 2018 ) . Visualization was per - 549 formed in ChimeraX . 550 Subtomogram averaging of ATP synthase and outer 551 mitochondrial membrane arrays . Subtomogram averag - 552 ing with missing wedge compensation was performed using 553 PEET 1 . 13 . 0 ( Heumann et al . , 2011 ; Nicastro et al . , 2006 ) . 554 Resolution was estimated using the Fourier shell correlation 555 ( FSC ) at a cut - off of 0 . 5 ( Nicastro et al . , 2006 ) . Alignments 556 were generally performed ﬁrst on binned data , after which 557 aligned positions and orientations were transferred to less - 558 binned data using scripts generously provided by Dr . Daven 559 Vasishtan . Details of acquisition parameters and particle 560 numbers are summarized in Table S1 . 561 Alignment strategies for these complexes were designed 562 to take advantage of their deﬁned orientations relative to the 563 membrane plane . Particles were picked manually and their 564 initial orientations were deﬁned using stalkInit . Initial refer - 565 ences were either a randomly chosen particle ( for ladder - like 566 arrays ) or an average of all particles after roughly aligning 567 them based on their initial orientations ( for ATP synthase ) . 568 Independent alignments using independent initial references 569 were performed for datasets from different species . Align - 570 ments allowed for large rotational search ranges around the 571 particle long axis ( deﬁned as the y - axis , perpendicular to the 572 membrane plane ) , with limited search ranges around the x - 573 and z - axes ( the membrane plane ) . 574 All initial alignments were performed without symmetry . 575 After visual inspection of the maps , twofold symmetry was 576 applied for ladder - like arrays . Symmetrization involved us - 577 ing the aligned positions from the unsymmetrized runs as 578 seed points and rotating particles around the axis of symme - 579 try to generate virtual particles . A symmetrized volume was 580 generated by averaging all particles and virtual particles and 581 used as a reference for a ﬁnal , restricted alignment . 582 Plotbacks were generated in IMOD by ﬁrst running cre - 583 ateAlignedModel to generate model ﬁles reﬂecting updated 584 particle positions and orientations after alignment . The rel - 585 evant subtomogram average was then thresholded for visu - 586 alization and saved as an isosurface model , which was then 587 placed back into the tomograms using clonemodel . 588 Measurements and quantiﬁcation . All measurements of 589 mitochondrial width were performed in IMOD on Volta 590 phase plate tomograms ﬁltered with a SIRT - like ﬁlter . Mi - 591 tochondrial width was measured in the non - missing wedge 592 direction at ﬁve points along the length of each mitochon - 593 drion . Only mitochondria that were entirely in the ﬁeld of 594 view were included in the measurements . Tomograms and 595 corresponding measurements were then grouped based on 596 their locations relative to the connecting piece , which were 597 determined based on low - magniﬁcation images used for tar - 598 geting during data acquisition . 599 Internal mitochondrial ultrastructure was quantiﬁed from 600 tomograms from cryo - FIB milled lamellae . The volume oc - 601 cupied by the matrix ( V matrix , the volume enclosed by the 602 IMM ) was measured relative to the volume occupied by the 603 entire mitochondrion ( V mito , the volume enclosed by the 604 OMM ) . Mesh volumes were extracted from segmentations 605 using imodinfo . Because neural network - based segmentation 606 often resulted in gaps , mitochondrial membranes were seg - 607 mented manually in IMOD for quantiﬁcation . Only slices in 608 which both the IMM and OMM were clearly deﬁned were 609 used for segmentation . 610 Cross - linking , lysis , digestion and peptide fractiona - 611 tion . All proteomics and cross - linking mass spectrometry ex - 612 Leung et al . | supramolecular assemblies at the mitochondria - cytoskeleton interface 9 periments were performed on Percoll - washed pig sperm pre - 613 pared as described above . For cross - linking , approximately 614 300 x 106 cells were used from 3 different animals . Brieﬂy , 615 pelleted sperm cells were resuspended in 540 µL of PBS 616 supplemented with disuccinimidyl sulfoxide ( DSSO , Thermo 617 Fisher Scientiﬁc ) to a ﬁnal concentration of 1 mM . The reac - 618 tion mix was incubated for 30 min at 25°C with 700 rpm 619 shaking in a ThemoMixer C ( Eppendorf ) and subsequently 620 quenched for 20 min by adding Tris - HCl ( ﬁnal concentra - 621 tion 50 mM ) . Cross - linked cells were spun down at 13 800g 622 for 10 min at 4°C , after which the supernatant was removed . 623 Cells were then lysed according to a protocol modiﬁed from 624 ( Potel et al . , 2018 ) . Cells were resuspended in 1 mL of ly - 625 sis buffer ( 100 mM Tris - HCl pH 8 . 5 , 7 M Urea , 1 % Triton 626 X - 100 , 5 mM TCEP , 30 mM CAA , 10 U / ml DNase I , 1 mM 627 MgCl2 , 1 % benzonase ( Merck Millipore , Darmstadt , Ger - 628 many ) , 1 mM sodium orthovanadate , phosphoSTOP phos - 629 phatases inhibitors , and cOmpleteTM Mini EDTA - free pro - 630 tease inhibitors ) . Cells were sonicated on ice for 2 min us - 631 ing an ultrasonic processor ( UP100H , Hielscher ) at 80 % am - 632 plitude . The proteins were then precipitated according to 633 ( Wessel and Flügge , 1984 ) and the dried protein pellet re - 634 suspended in digestion buffer ( 100 mM Tris - HCl pH 8 . 5 , 1 % 635 sodium deoxycholate ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , 5 mM TCEP , and 30 636 mM CAA ) . Trypsin and Lys - C proteases were added to a 1 : 25 637 and 1 : 100 ratio ( w / w ) respectively and protein digestion per - 638 formed overnight at 37°C . The ﬁnal peptide mixtures were 639 desalted with solid - phase extraction C18 columns ( Sep - Pak , 640 Waters ) and fractionated with an Agilent 1200 HPLC pump 641 system ( Agilent ) coupled to a strong cation exchange ( SCX ) 642 separation column ( Luna SCX 5 µm – 100 Å particles , 50 x 643 2mm , Phenomenex ) , resulting in 25 fractions . 644 Liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry . Ap - 645 proximately 1000 ng of peptides from each biological repli - 646 cate before SCX fractionation were ﬁrst injected onto an Ag - 647 ilent 1290 Inﬁnity UHPLC system ( Agilent ) on a 50 - cm an - 648 alytical column packed with C18 beads ( Dr Maisch Reprosil 649 C18 , 3 µm ) coupled online to an Orbitrap HF - X ( Thermo 650 Fisher Scientiﬁc ) . For this classical bottom - up analysis , we 651 used the following LC - MS / MS parameters : after 5 min of 652 loading with 100 % buffer A ( H2O with 0 . 1 % formic acid ) , 653 peptides were eluted at 300 nL / min with a 95 - min gradient 654 from 13 % to 40 % of buffer B ( 80 % acetonitrile and 20 % 655 H2O with 0 . 1 % formic acid ) . For MS acquisition we used an 656 MS1 Orbitrap scan at 60 , 000 resolution , automatic gain con - 657 trol ( AGC ) target of 3 x 106 ions and maximum inject time 658 of 20 ms from 375 to 1600 m / z ; the 15 most intense ions 659 were submitted to MS2 Orbitrap scan at 30 , 000 resolution , 660 AGC target of 1 x 105 ions and maximum inject time of 50 661 ms ( isolation window of 1 . 4 m / z , NCE at 27 % and dynamic 662 exclusion of 16 seconds ) . The SCX fractions were analyzed 663 with same Agilent HPLC and the same nano - column cou - 664 pled on - line to an Orbitrap Lumos mass spectrometer ( Ther - 665 moFisher Scientiﬁc ) . For these runs , we used a gradient from 666 6 % to 39 % buffer B over 100 min with speciﬁc MS settings 667 for DSSO cross - links : survey MS1 Orbitrap scan at 60 , 000 668 resolution from 375 to 1500 , AGC target of 4 x 105 ions and 669 maximum inject time of 50 ms ; MS2 Orbitrap scan at 30 , 000 670 resolution , AGC target of 5 x 104 ions , and maximum in - 671 ject time of 100 ms for detection of DSSO signature peaks 672 ( difference in mass of 37 . 972 Da ) . The four ions with this 673 speciﬁc difference were analyzed with a MS3 Ion Trap scans 674 at AGC target of 2 x 104 ions , maximum inject time of 150 675 ms for sequencing selected signature peaks ( representing the 676 individual peptides ) . 677 Mass spectrometry data processing . The 3 raw ﬁles ob - 678 tained with classical bottom - up approach were analyzed with 679 MaxQuant version 1 . 6 . 17 with all the automatic settings 680 adding Deamidation ( N ) as dynamic modiﬁcation against the 681 Sus scrofa reference proteome ( Uniprot version of 08 / 2020 682 with 49 , 795 entries ) . With this search , we were able to 683 calculate intensity - based absolute quantiﬁcation ( iBAQ ) val - 684 ues and created a smaller FASTA ﬁle to use for analysis of 685 cross - linking experiments ( table as Supplementary informa - 686 tion ) . Raw ﬁles for cross - linked cells were analyzed with 687 Proteome Discoverer software suite version 2 . 4 . 1 . 15 ( Ther - 688 moFisher Scientiﬁc ) with the incorporated XlinkX node for 689 analysis of cross - linked peptides as described in ( Klykov et 690 al . , 2018 ) . Data were searched against the smaller FASTA 691 created in house with “MS2 _ MS3 acquisition strategy” . For 692 the XlinkX search , we selected full tryptic digestion with 3 693 maximum missed cleavages , 10 ppm error for MS1 , 20 ppm 694 for MS2 , and 0 . 5 Da for MS3 in Ion Trap . For modiﬁcations , 695 we used static Carbamidomethyl ( C ) and dynamic Oxidation 696 ( M ) , Deamidation ( N ) and Met - loss ( protein N - term ) . The 697 crosslinked peptides were accepted with a minimum score of 698 40 , minimum score difference of 4 and maximum FDR rate 699 set to 5 % ; further standard settings were used . 700 Interactome analysis , homology modelling , and 701 cross - link mapping . The interaction map for VDAC pro - 702 teins was generated in R ( Grant et al . , 2006 ) using the igraph 703 package ( v 1 . 2 . 4 . 2 ) . Only cross - links with at least two cross - 704 link spectral matches ( CSMs ) were used for network genera - 705 tion . Homology models of GK and VDAC2 were generated 706 in Robetta ( Kim et al . , 2004 ) and ﬁtted into subtomogram 707 average maps by rigid body ﬁtting in Chimera X . Cross - links 708 were mapped onto the resulting models using ChimeraX . 709 Data availability . Subtomogram average maps have been 710 deposited to the Electron Microscopy Data Bank ( EMDB ) 711 with the following accession numbers : EMDB - 12354 , 712 12355 , 12356 , and 12357 . The model of putative glycerol 713 kinase - like proteins anchored on a VDAC array has been de - 714 posited to the Protein Data Bank ( PDB ) with the accession 715 number PDB ID 7NIE . 716 10 | Leung et al . | supramolecular assemblies at the mitochondria - cytoskeleton interface Fig . S1 . Mitochondrial dimensions are consistent within species but vary across species and spatially along the midpiece . ( a ) Plotting the average width of mitochondria from different regions of the midpiece shows that mouse sperm mitochondria are larger than pig and horse sperm mitochondria . Note also that , in all three species , mitochondria at the proximal end of the midpiece are larger than those in more distal parts . ( b ) Mitochondrial width was measured at ﬁve points along the length of each mitochondrion .
