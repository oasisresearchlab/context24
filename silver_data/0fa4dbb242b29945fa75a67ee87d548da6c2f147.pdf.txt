Supporting information S3 Note Proof Let P be the set of all non - null strings composed from letters a , b , . . . . , z . Observe that P is a semigroup when the operation “append” is considered . It is easy to show that there exists a semigroup automorphism h s : P → P which extends h (cid:48) . Because of the definition of Π , it is easy to see that the restriction of h s to A ⊆ P is the map we need . PLOS 43 / 51
