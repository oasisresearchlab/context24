Jaynes * Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and the Kimmel Cancer Center , Thomas Jefferson University , Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , United States of America Abstract Insulators can block the action of enhancers on promoters and the spreading of repressive chromatin , as well as facilitating specific enhancer - promoter interactions . However , recent studies have called into question whether the activities ascribed to insulators in model transgene assays actually reflect their functions in the genome . The Drosophila even skipped ( eve ) gene is a Polycomb ( Pc ) domain with a Pc - group response element ( PRE ) at one end , flanked by an insulator , an arrangement also seen in other genes . Here , we show that this insulator has three major functions . It blocks the spreading of the eve Pc domain , preventing repression of the adjacent gene , TER94 . It prevents activation of TER94 by eve regulatory DNA . It also facilitates normal eve expression . When Homie is deleted in the context of a large transgene that mimics both eve and TER94 regulation , TER94 is repressed . This repression depends on the eve PRE . Ubiquitous TER94 expression is ‘‘replaced’’ by expression in an eve pattern when Homie is deleted , and this effect is reversed when the PRE is also removed . Repression of TER94 is attributable to spreading of the eve Pc domain into the TER94 locus , accompanied by an increase in histone H3 trimethylation at lysine 27 . Other PREs can functionally replace the eve PRE , and other insulators can block PRE - dependent repression in this context . The full activity of the eve promoter is also dependent on Homie , and other insulators can promote normal eve enhancer - promoter communication . Our data suggest that this is not due to preventing promoter competition , but is likely the result of the insulator organizing a chromosomal conformation favorable to normal enhancer - promoter interactions . Thus , insulator activities in a native context include enhancer blocking and enhancer - promoter facilitation , as well as preventing the spread of repressive chromatin .

Cis - regulatory modules ( CRMs , or enhancers ) are bound by DNA - binding transcription factors that coordinately recruit coactivators and corepressors . Enhancers communicate with basal promoters at least in part through a looping out of intervening DNA , allowing them to act over large distances along a chromosome , or even in trans , with a promoter on another chromosome [ 1 – 4 ] . Enhancer activities are regulated by the chromatin environment , which is ‘‘managed’’ by both the enhancers themselves and other DNA elements such as Polycomb - group response elements ( PREs ) [ 5 – 8 ] . Further coordi - nation of these activities is provided by elements such as insulators that affect chromosomal organization and conformation . Insula - tors harbor activities that can limit the range of action of enhancers and repressive chromatin , as well as facilitate long - range enhancer - promoter communication , depending on context [ 9 – 12 ] . Insulators typically show ‘‘barrier’’ function that prevents the spread of heterochromatin , as well as enhancer blocking activity , in model transgene assays [ 9 – 12 ] . Pairs of insulators can interact with each other to generate chromosomal loops between them . This has been postulated to create distinct functional domains that somehow prevent enhancer - promoter cross - talk between domains . Repressive chromatin structures include heterochromatin and Polycomb ( Pc ) chromatin , which constitutes a form of epigenetic transcriptional memory , stabilizing developmental fate choices , among other functions . Pc chromatin is maintained through the recruitment of Pc - group ( PcG ) gene products to PREs [ 5 – 8 ] . PREs can extend their influence outward to produce Polycomb domains that encompass multiple regulatory regions within a gene or a gene complex [ 13 – 17 ] . PREs can also synergize with each other in trans [ 18 ] , and in some cases facilitate long - range enhancer - promoter communication [ 19 ] . Both Pc domains and mammalian X - inactivation involve the histone modification H3K27me3 , cata - lyzed by Pc - repressive complex 2 ( PRC2 ) [ 20 – 22 ] . The functions of PREs and insulators have been studied within Drosophila Hox genes [ 23 – 25 ] . There , functional chromatin domains are flanked by insulators , so that all the enhancers and PREs within a domain are coordinately regulated . Enhancers acting early in development ( ‘‘initiators’’ ) are spatially regulated to determine whether a domain will be active or not throughout the rest of development . They do this by inactivating PREs , so that PLOS Genetics | www . plosgenetics . org 1 October 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 10 | e1003883 where initiators are active , later - acting enhancers can also be active . The main effect of deleting insulators in this context is to extend the influence of initiators to inactivate PREs in the adjacent domain , which allows its later - acting enhancers to be inappropri - ately active . However , phenotypic details suggest that in some cells , repressive chromatin may spread instead [ 26 ] . Genome - wide chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) analysis of the locations of insulator binding proteins show a wide range of binding patterns [ 27 – 40 ] . In Drosophila , insulator proteins include dCTCF ( CCCTC - binding factor ) , Mod ( mdg4 ) 67 . 2 , Su ( Hw ) ( Sup - pressor of hairy wing ) , CP190 ( centrosomal protein 190 ) , BEAF32 ( boundary element - associated factor 32 ) , and Zw5 ( Zeste - white - 5 ) . Recent genome - wide studies also implicate the mitotic spindle protein Chromator [ 41 ] and the nuclear lamina [ 30 , 37 ] in insulator function . In mammals , CTCF is associated with most known insulators [ 10 , 12 , 42 – 44 ] . CTCF functions in the regulation of b - globin [ 45 , 46 ] and the imprinted Igf2 and H19 loci [ 47 – 49 ] . Based on recent genome - wide studies , it has been suggested that insulator proteins bind at many sites that do not function as predicted by model transgene assays [ 34 , 36 , 38 ] . Transgenic dissection in a native context can help to determine their normal functions . The even skipped ( eve ) locus is a well - defined Pc domain based on genome - wide analysis [ 13 – 17 ] , and is regulated by PcG genes [ 50 – 54 ] . An insulator flanks its well - characterized regulatory region , which includes the eve PRE at its 3 9 end [ 51 , 55 ] . Thus , this insulator is in a position to separate both positive and negative eve regulatory elements from the constitutively expressed neighboring gene TER94 , and / or to prevent ectopic activation of eve by TER94 enhancers . This insulator was shown to have 3 distinct activities in model transgene assays . In addition to enhancer blocking , it causes homing of P - element transgenes to the endogenous eve neighbor - hood , for which it was nicknamed Homie ( Homing insulator at eve ) . Furthermore , from within a several megabase region flanking endogenous eve , it causes long - range interactions of transgenic promoters with endogenous eve enhancers [ 55 ] . Genome - wide analysis showed that most known insulator proteins bind to the Homie region [ 27 , 33 ] . Homie shares properties with other insulators based on model transgene assays and , like many other putative insulators , is situated close to both a transcription start site ( TSS ) and a PRE . Thus , understanding Homie’s function in its native context can illuminate many of the mysteries that surround this enigmatic group of regulatory elements . In order to investigate its native function , we constructed a transgenic eve - TER94 locus that mimics the normal regulation of both genes . Using this artificial locus , we show that Homie functions as a PRE blocker to protect TER94 from repression due to spreading of the eve Pc domain . Heterologous insulators and PREs can substitute for Homie and the eve PRE , suggesting that limiting the range of PRE action is an important function of insulators generally . Homie also prevents the eve enhancers from activating TER94 in specific tissues . Furthermore , Homie facilitates normal eve expression by aug - menting communication between the eve promoter and its 3 9 enhancers , likely through a chromosomal looping mechanism . Results Insulators are generally considered to have two major functions . First , they can shield promoters from the effects of distal enhancers . Second , they can block the spread of repressive chromatin . Here , we investigate the roles that these activities play in the normal functions of an insulator ( Homie ) located between the ubiquitously expressed TER94 gene and the highly patterned eve gene . We find that blocking the spread of repressive Polycomb chromatin by Homie is critical for normal TER94 promoter expression . In addition to exhibiting the canonical insulator activities in a near - native context , we find that Homie facilitates certain aspects of normal eve expression , and we present a model for how this occurs . Homie Shields the TER94 Promoter from eve PRE Activity In order to analyze the function of the eve 3 9 insulator Homie , we employed a pseudo - locus that contains all the regulatory DNA necessary for normal expression of both eve [ 56 – 59 ] and the 3 9 adjacent gene TER94 [ 60 – 62 ] . This transgene extends from 2 6 . 4 to + 11 . 3 kb relative to the eve TSS , from the 5 9 - most enhancer of eve to the 3 rd exon of TER94 . In addition to all of the eve enhancers , this region contains a characterized PRE [ 51 ] located just upstream ( on the eve side ) of Homie [ 55 ] . On the other side of Homie is the TER94 promoter and TSS , which are sufficient for ubiquitous expression , augmented by enhancers in the TER94 introns ( data not shown ) . The eve coding region was replaced with lacZ coding DNA , and the 3 rd exon of TER94 was fused with the EGFP coding region ( Figure 1A ) . In this study , we make repeated use of a version of recombinase - mediated cassette exchange ( RMCE ) [ 63 ] that allows modified transgenes to be inserted in either orientation at pre - defined chromosomal landing sites . All aspects of transgene expression were consistent for both orienta - tions and at multiple landing sites , with a few minor exceptions ( as noted below ) . In embryos , TER94 RNA is present ubiquitously at early blastoderm , and begins to fade around stage 10 . Most of this RNA is maternally derived , but there is a ubiquitous zygotic contribu - tion as well ( see below ) . At stage 10 and later , strong expression is also observed throughout the brain and central nervous system ( CNS ) [ 55 ] . TER94 - GFP expression from our transgene simulates endogenous TER94 expression ( Figure 1B , ‘‘intact t’gene’’ ) . Although the level of expression varies somewhat with chromo - somal location , the relative behavior of modified transgenes was consistent at each chromosomal location ( compare Figure 1B and Figure S1 ) . Author Summary Insulators are specialized DNA elements that can separate the genome into functional units . Most of the current thinking about these elements comes from studies done with model transgenes . Studies of insulators within the specialized Hox gene complexes have suggested that model transgenes can reflect the normal functions of these elements in their native context . However , recent genome - wide studies have called this into question . This work analyzes the native function of an insulator that resides between the Drosophila genes eve and TER94 , which are expressed in very different patterns . Also , the eve gene is a Polycomb ( Pc ) domain , a specialized type of chromatin that is found in many places throughout the genome . We show that this insulator has three major functions . It blocks the spreading of the eve Pc domain , preventing repression of TER94 . It prevents activation of TER94 by eve regulatory DNA . It also facilitates normal eve expression . Each of these activities are consistent with those seen with model transgenes , and other known insulators can provide these functions in this context . This work provides a novel and convincing example of the normal role of insulators in regulating the eukaryotic genome , as well as providing insights into their mechanisms of action . PRE Blocking by Insulators PLOS Genetics | www . plosgenetics . org 2 October 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 10 | e1003883 Deletion of Homie caused a severe loss of early , ubiquitous expression driven by the TER94 promoter ( Figure 1B ‘‘ D Homie’’ , Figure S1 ) . When the eve PRE was deleted in addition to Homie , the ubiquitous expression in embryos returned ( Figure 1B ‘‘ D Homie D PRE’’ , Figure S1 ) . Deletion of the eve PRE alone did not affect the expression pattern ( Figure 1B ‘‘ D PRE’’ ) . These results show that the loss of ubiquitous expression from the TER94 promoter caused by deletion of Homie depends on the presence of the PRE . So , one function of Homie is to protect TER94 from PRE - dependent repression . We also note that when Homie is removed , expression in an eve - like pattern is seen ( Figure 1B ‘‘ D Homie’’ , Figure S1A ) . This indicates that without Homie , eve enhancers can access the TER94 promoter . We investigate this effect further below . Homie Blocks eve PRE Activity in Ovaries Early , ubiquitous expression of TER94 comes from maternally deposited RNA , based on its early appearance and the fact that TER94 is expressed strongly in developing oocytes [ 60 – 62 ] . This was confirmed by staining for transgene expression in the absence of a maternal contribution , which is much weaker at early stages than the maternally derived signal ( Figure S2 ‘‘intact t’gene’’ ; compare to Figure 1B , Figure S1 ) . Since TER94 - GFP RNA is deposited maternally , we examined expression in ovaries . TER94 mRNA is present in both the germline , including nurse cells , and somatic epithelial follicle cells [ 60 – 62 ] . No eve expression in ovaries has been reported . In our transgenic lines , strong TER94 - GFP expression was seen at all stages of oogenesis ( Figure 2 ‘‘intact t’gene’’ , Figure S4 ) in both germline and somatic epithelial cells ( Figure S3 ‘‘intact t’gene’’ ) . However , the level depended to some extent on chromosomal location ( compare Figure 2 and Figure S4 ) . In each case , expression was severely repressed when Homie was deleted ( Figure 2 ‘‘ D Ho - mie’’ , Figure S4 ) . As was seen in embryos , it was restored when the PRE was also deleted ( Figure 2 ‘‘ D Homie D PRE’’ , Figure S4 ) . These data confirm that in ovaries , Homie is required for TER94 promoter activity , due to its blocking of PRE - dependent repression . Figure 1 . Homie shields the TER94 promoter from eve PRE activity . A : map of the eve - TER94 transgene . The 3 rd exon of the TER94 protein coding region is fused to that of GFP , while the eve coding region is replaced by that of lacZ . Otherwise , the transgene consists of the entire genomic region from 2 6 . 4 kb to + 11 . 3 kb relative to the eve TSS , and includes all of the eve enhancers , plus TER94 enhancers located within its first two introns . The locations of the major eve PRE ( ‘‘ eve PRE’’ ) , 3 9 insulator ( ‘‘Homie’’ ) , early embryonic stripe enhancers ( numbered ) , and late embryonic enhancers ( labeled ) are shown as colored boxes . B : embryonic expression , at the indicated stages , of GFP RNA , driven by the TER94 promoter , from the transgene shown in A ( top row ‘‘intact t’gene’’ ) , or the same transgene modified by deletion of either the insulator alone ( 2 nd row ‘‘ D Homie’’ ) , the PRE alone ( bottom row ‘‘ D PRE’’ ) , or both ( 3 rd row ‘‘ D Homie D PRE’’ ) , each inserted at attP landing site 95E5 , visualized by whole - mount in situ hybridization . Note that the normal , ubiquitous expression ( mimicking TER94 ) is changed to resemble the eve pattern ( shown for comparison at the bottom ) by deletion of Homie , while further deletion of the PRE restores TER94 - like expression . Deletion of the PRE alone does not noticeably affect the embryonic pattern . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pgen . 1003883 . g001 PRE Blocking by Insulators PLOS Genetics | www . plosgenetics . org 3 October 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 10 | e1003883 The eve PRE Is Redundant in Embryos Since most of the ubiquitous TER94 - GFP RNA seen in early embryos is maternally derived , we tested whether zygotic expression from a paternally - derived transgene is affected by Homie deletion . In this assay , non - transgene - carrying ( yw ) female flies are crossed with transgene - carrying males , so that there is no maternal GFP RNA in the progeny . Two chromosomal locations were analyzed . In both cases , GFP expression was reduced when Homie was deleted ( Figure S2 ) . Because of the relatively low level of expression , we quantified GFP RNA using RT - PCR . Embryos from three timed collections were analyzed : 2 – 3 hr . ( stages 5 – 6 ) and 4 – 6 hr . ( stages 9 – 11 ) after egg deposition , and stages 13 – 15 . The effect of Homie deletion paralleled those described above for both ovaries and embryos , in that expression was repressed . However , unlike in ovaries , when both Homie and the PRE were deleted , TER94 - GFP expression remained repressed at all stages examined ( Figure S2 and data not shown ) . This is consistent with the idea , confirmed below , that another PRE in the eve locus substitutes in embryos ( but not in ovaries ) for the eve 3 9 PRE . In fact , the eve promoter - proximal region has PRE - like properties [ 51 ] ( see Discussion ) . Other Drosophila Insulators Block eve PRE Action Are the functions of Homie seen in our assays unique , or are they shared among insulators ? In order to test this , we replaced Homie with other known insulators . As a negative control , a . 500 bp stretch of l phage DNA was tested . It had no effect on repression of the TER94 promoter by the eve PRE ( Figure 3A ‘‘ D Homie’’ ) . In contrast , other characterized Drosophila insulators can substitute for Homie to block repression . gypsy ( Figure 3A , B ) , Fab - 7 , scs’ ( Figure 3A ) , and Fab - 8 ( Figure 3B ) each prevented TER94 promoter repression . Although in one orientation , scs did not work ( Figure 3A , ‘‘ + scs ’’ ) , it did work in the opposite orientation ( Figure 3A , ‘‘ + scs ( inv ) ’’ ) . Fab - 8 and gypsy showed a minor directionality in their effectiveness ( not shown ) . Restoration of GFP expression is somewhat weaker for scs’ and scs ( inv ) than for gypsy and Fab - 7 , indicating that they only partially block eve PRE action . Despite differences in efficiency , blocking of PRE action in this context is a shared property of insulators . Heterologous PREs Repress TER94 in the Absence of an Insulator , and Homie Blocks this Repression In order to test whether the repression of TER94 by the eve PRE is due to some unusual property associated with this PRE , we replaced it with other known PREs . We tested both the bxd PRE and an en PRE for the ability to substitute for the eve PRE in ovaries , in the context of a Homie - deleted transgene . In both Figure 2 . Homie blocks PRE action in ovaries . Fluorescence and GFP RNA levels in ovarioles from fly lines carrying the indicated transgenic reporters ( described in Figure 1 ) , or no transgene ( ‘‘no t’gene’’ ) . Note the strong fluorescence from TER94 promoter - driven GFP with the intact transgene ( ‘‘intact t’gene’’ ) at all stages of oogenesis ( which proceeds from left to right within each string of ovarioles ) , and that this is lost when Homie is deleted ( ‘‘ D Homie’’ ) . Remarkably , strong GFP expression is restored when both Homie and the PRE are deleted ( ‘‘ D Homie D PRE’’ ) , indicating that in the absence of Homie , the PRE is responsible for repression of TER94 - GFP . Strong expression is also seen when only the PRE is removed ( ‘‘ D PRE’’ ) . The graph at the bottom shows , on a log scale , the results of quantitation in triplicate ( averages with standard deviations ) of GFP RNA from ovaries of lines carrying the indicated transgenes ( see Materials and Methods ) . Note that GFP RNA levels decrease more than 50 - fold when Homie is deleted , and are restored by additional deletion of the PRE . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pgen . 1003883 . g002 PRE Blocking by Insulators PLOS Genetics | www . plosgenetics . org 4 October 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 10 | e1003883 PRE Blocking by Insulators PLOS Genetics | www . plosgenetics . org 5 October 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 10 | e1003883 cases , repression was seen at a comparable level to that seen with the eve PRE ( Figure 3C , compare to Figure 3A , B ‘‘ D Homie’’ ) , indicating that TER94 repression is due to a property shared by PREs . We also tested whether Homie can prevent repression by heterologous PREs . To so this , we replaced the eve PRE with either the bxd PRE or the en PRE . In both cases , Homie blocked their action on the TER94 promoter , and the resulting GFP expression was like that of the wild - type transgene ( Figure 3D ) . This shows that Homie can block repression by a variety of PREs . Taken together , these results suggest that insulators block PRE - dependent repression generally . Thus , the commonly occurring arrangement of PREs flanked on one side by insulators [ 31 ] is likely to function to provide a sharp transition in chromatin structure . Homie Prevents Spreading of the eve Polycomb Domain The eve locus is a Pc domain , associated with both Polycomb and the characteristic histone modification H3K27me3 [ 13 – 17 ] . We asked whether the repression of TER94 - GFP in the D Homie transgene is accompanied by spreading of this Pc domain over the TER94 - GFP promoter . Indeed , in ovaries , we found that H3K27me3 was increased in the TER94 - GFP region when Homie was deleted ( Figure 4A , B ) . Additionally removing the PRE reversed this effect almost completely ( Figure 4A , B ) , indicating that spreading of H3K27me3 depends on the eve PRE . Thus , when TER94 - GFP is repressed , H3K27me3 is increased , and when this repression is reversed , H3K27me3 levels return to normal . This suggests that Pc domain spreading is likely to be responsible for the repression . In embryos , as in ovaries , H3K27me3 spreads into the TER94 - GFP region when Homie is deleted ( Figure 4C , D ) . However , in contrast to ovaries , additionally removing the PRE does not reverse the effect ( Figure 4C , D ) , suggesting that there is redundancy between this PRE and other PREs in embryos . This redundant activity may be provided by the eve upstream promoter region [ 51 ] , or by uncharacterized PREs within the eve locus . Again , recalling that the eve PRE is redundant in embryos for repression of TER94 - GFP in the absence of Homie ( Figure S2 ) , there is a striking correlation between spreading of the Pc domain and repression of the TER94 promoter . Homie Shields the TER94 Promoter from eve Enhancers Intriguingly , when Homie is deleted , the loss of ubiquitous TER94 - GFP expression is accompanied by weak expression in an eve pattern ( Figure 1B ‘‘ D Homie’’ , Figure S1A ) . With the intact transgene , early stripe expression of TER94 - GFP driven by eve enhancers might be obscured by early ubiquitous expression , so we cannot rule out that eve enhancers are working on the TER94 promoter at early stages . In fact , eve - like stripe expression from the transgenic TER94 promoter is seen at one chromosomal landing site when the intact transgene is heterozygous and paternally derived , so that there is no maternal contribution ( Figure S2B ‘‘intact t’gene’’ ) . However , eve - like mesodermal , CNS , and anal plate ring ( APR ) expression seems clearly to be caused by deletion of Homie ( Figure 1B ‘‘ D Homie’’ , stages 11 and 15 ; Figure S1A ‘‘ D Homie’’ , stage 13 ) , because with the intact transgene , ubiqui - tous expression in these tissues is low , yet no such eve - like expression is seen . Furthermore , these later - stage aspects of eve expression are not seen with a paternally derived , intact transgene ( Figure S2 ) . Therefore , the data suggest that one of Homie’s functions is to prevent interaction between the TER94 promoter and eve enhancers . Accompanying the recovered ubiquitous expression when the PRE is also deleted , expression in an eve pattern is lost ( Figure 1B ‘‘ D Homie D PRE’’ , stages 11 and 15 ; Figure S1A ‘‘ D Homie D PRE’’ , stage 13 ) . This loss of mesodermal , CNS , and APR expression of TER94 - GFP caused by additional deletion of the PRE indicates that the PRE not only represses ubiquitous TER94 promoter activity , but also facilitates commu - nication between the eve enhancers and the TER94 promoter in the absence of Homie ( see Discussion ) . Homie Facilitates eve 3 9 Enhancer Action on the eve Promoter We then tested whether Homie affects eve promoter activity . To do this , we monitored transgenic lacZ expression , which is driven by the eve promoter ( Figure 5 , Figure S5A , B ) . When Homie is removed , there is a reduction in expression driven by enhancers located 3 9 of the eve coding region . Interestingly , these are the eve enhancers located between Homie and the eve TSS . Comparing ‘‘ D Homie’’ with the intact transgene at stage 5 ( Figure 5 left column ) , we see that stripes 1 , 4 , 5 , and 6 are weakened relative to stripes 2 , 3 , and 7 . A similar reduction of expression is seen at later stages , where mesodermal , CNS , and APR expression are weakened by deletion of Homie ( Figure 5 middle and right columns ) . This effect is seen at all transgene landing sites tested ( Figure 5A , Figure S5A , B ) , although it varies in strength with the direction of transgene insertion ( data not shown ) . Despite these differences , we consistently see significant disruptions of normal eve expression when Homie is removed . It seemed possible that the effects of removing Homie on eve promoter activity were caused by the relief of enhancer blocking , which then might allow eve enhancers access to the TER94 promoter . The resulting promoter competition might reduce eve expression . Alternatively , removing Homie might cause the loss of a chromosome conformation that favors eve enhancer - promoter interactions . This possibility is suggested by the ability of Homie to promote the activation by endogenous eve enhancers of a transgenic eve promoter located up to several megabases away Figure 3 . Other Drosophila insulators block eve PRE action , and other PREs are blocked by Homie . A : fluorescence from transgenic TER94 - GFP in the context of the transgene diagrammed in Figure 1A at the 95E5 landing site , with Homie replaced by either l phage DNA ( ‘‘ D Homie’’ ) or the indicated insulator . Diagrams below each panel show the arrangement of regulatory elements affecting GFP expression : yellow - filled boxes are PREs , either from eve ( unlabeled ) , en , or the bxd region of Ubx , as indicated ; red - filled boxes are insulators , either Homie ( unlabeled ) , or as labeled . Note that each of these insulators restore TER94 promoter activity , although scs does so when inserted in one orientation ( ‘‘ scs ( inv ) ’’ ) but not the other ( ‘‘ scs ’’ ) relative to the TER94 - GFP promoter . Note also that restoration of GFP expression is somewhat weaker for scs’ and scs ( even in the ‘‘inverted’’ orientation ) than for gypsy and Fab - 7 , indicating that they only partially block eve PRE action . B : same as in A , except that the transgenes were inserted in opposite orientation at the same landing site relative to that in A , with either the gypsy insulator or the Fab - 8 insulator . Note that eve PRE action is blocked in both cases , causing strong fluorescence . C : fluorescence from transgenic TER94 - GFP in the context of the transgene diagrammed in Figure 1A , with Homie deleted , and with either the eve PRE deleted ( ‘‘ D Homie D PRE’’ ) , or replaced by the bxd PRE ( ‘‘ + bxd PRE’’ ) or the en PRE ( ‘‘ + en PRE’’ ) . Note that each of these PREs repress TER94 - GFP to a similar degree as does the eve PRE in the absence of an insulator ( compare to ‘‘ D Homie’’ panels in A and B , where the eve PRE is present ) . D : fluorescence from transgenic TER94 - GFP in the context of the transgene diagrammed in Figure 1A , with the eve PRE either removed ( ‘‘ D PRE’’ ) , or replaced by either the bxd PRE ( ‘‘ + bxd PRE’’ ) or the en PRE ( ‘‘ + en PRE’’ ) . Note that neither of these PREs is able to repress TER94 - GFP when Homie is present , showing that Homie blocks the repressive action of these heterologous PREs . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pgen . 1003883 . g003 PRE Blocking by Insulators PLOS Genetics | www . plosgenetics . org 6 October 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 10 | e1003883 [ 55 ] . To distinguish between these possibilities , we performed two sets of experiments . First , we tested whether expression from the TER94 promoter occurs in a pattern that matches the loss of expression from the eve promoter when Homie is deleted . We found that this is not the case . Rather , TER94 expression in an eve striped pattern does not show a difference among the stripes ( Figure 1B D Homie , compare to Figure 5 ) . Second , we directly tested the promoter competition hypothesis by deleting the TER94 promoter in addition to Homie . Removing the potentially competing promoter did not restore normal eve expression ( Figure 5B ) . While we cannot rule out competition with endogenous promoters , promoter competition seems unlikely to be the primary cause of the eve pattern disruptions that result from removal of Homie . The facilitation of eve promoter activity by Figure 4 . Homie blocks spreading of the eve Pc / H3K27me3 domain into the adjacent gene , TER94 . ChIP assays were used to quantify the association of H3K27me3 with the endogenous eve and TER94 coding regions , and with the transgenic eve - lacZ and TER94 - GFP coding regions . A , B : ovaries were dissected and subjected to ChIP analysis , as described in Materials and Methods . In A is graphed the averages and standard deviations from triplicate PCR assays using primer pairs specific to each of the 4 coding region indicated along the bottom , and for the transgenic lines indicated ( ‘‘intact t’gene’’ carries the entire transgene diagrammed in Figure 1A ; ‘‘ D Homie’’ is the same transgene with Homie deleted ; ‘‘ D Homie D PRE’’ has both Homie and the PRE deleted ) . Either H3K27me3 - specific antibodies or non - specific IgG were used to precipitate cross - linked chromatin , as indicated in the inset key . In B is graphed the same data ( ‘‘trial 2’’ in the inset key ) , and two other trials ( ‘‘trial 1’’ and ‘‘trial 3’’ ) using independent chromatin preparations ( see Materials and Methods ) , normalized to the H3K27me3 - specific signal from the eve coding region for each transgenic line . C , D : embryos ( 2 – 20 hr . after egg deposition ) were collected and subjected to ChIP analysis , as in A and B above . Note that the specific signals from the transgenic eve - lacZ coding region do not change significantly when Homie is deleted , while the transgenic TER94 - GFP coding region shows an increase in H3K27 trimethylation when Homie is deleted , correlating with its repression . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pgen . 1003883 . g004 PRE Blocking by Insulators PLOS Genetics | www . plosgenetics . org 7 October 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 10 | e1003883 Homie may therefore be due to its ability to organize specific chromosomal loops , possibly with the eve promoter ( see Discus - sion ) . Interestingly , heterologous insulators are able to restore normal eve enhancer - promoter interactions to different degrees ( Figure S5C and data not shown ) , roughly in parallel to their abilities to restore PRE blocking ( Figure 3A , B ) . For example , gypsy restores normal eve promoter activity , while scs does not ( Figure S5C ) . The abilities of heterologous insulators to perform this function may be due to interactions between them and a region of the eve locus that normally interacts with Homie . Discussion A Transgenic eve - TER94 Locus to Assess PRE and Insulator Activity The eve 3 9 insulator , Homie , was shown previously to have three activities : P - element transgene homing , enhancer blocking , and facilitation of long - range enhancer - promoter communication between endogenous eve enhancers and a transgenic promoter [ 55 ] . We sought to address how these activities relate to Homie’s normal function . Both eve and TER94 are essential genes , and eve is highly dose - dependent , making it problematic to manipulate the Figure 5 . Homie facilitates eve 3 9 enhancer action on the eve promoter through a mechanism that does not involve the TER94 promoter . Expression of lacZ RNA driven by the eve promoter from the transgene diagrammed at the top ( described in Figure 1A ) and its derivatives was monitored by in situ hybridization . A : Representative embryos are shown at either stage 5 ( left column ) or stage 13 ( middle and right columns , which show two different orientations and focal planes at higher magnification ) . Note that when Homie is deleted ( ‘‘ D Homie’’ ) , stripes 1 , 4 , 5 , and 6 are weakened relative to stripes 2 , 3 , and 7 ( left column ) , while all aspects of expression at later stages , in the mesoderm , CNS , and APR , are also weakened ( middle and right columns ) . These weakened expression elements are all driven by enhancers located between the eve and TER94 promoters . These effects are also seen when both Homie and the PRE are deleted ( ‘‘ D Homie D PRE’’ ) , but not when the PRE alone is deleted ( ‘‘ D PRE’’ ) . B : Representative embryos are shown at 3 embryonic stages ( stages 5 , 11 , and 13 , in the left , middle , and right columns , respectively ) . In D Homie D TER94 , the entire TER94 - GFP gene including the TER94 promoter was removed . Note that the weakened activity of 3 9 enhancers seen for D Homie is also seen for D Homie D TER94 , indicating that competition with the TER94 promoter is not causing the reduced eve promoter activity . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pgen . 1003883 . g005 PRE Blocking by Insulators PLOS Genetics | www . plosgenetics . org 8 October 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 10 | e1003883 endogenous locus . Therefore , we constructed a transgene that contains these genes in their normal configuration . Both the eve and TER94 coding regions were replaced with reporter genes to monitor promoter activity . This transgene simulates the expression pattern of both genes , when inserted at several different chromosomal sites . We used this system to manipulate both Homie and the nearby PRE , to assess their normal functions . Homie Protects the TER94 Promoter from Spreading of PRE - dependent Repressive Chromatin A major finding of this study is that Homie is required to prevent PRE - dependent repression of the TER94 promoter . Removal of Homie causes a near - complete loss of the normally ubiquitous TER94 promoter activity . Although Homie is close to the TER94 promoter , its removal does not affect the promoter directly . Rather , removing Homie allows eve enhancers to drive the TER94 promoter in an eve pattern ( Figure 1 ) . Furthermore , additional removal of the nearby PRE restores ubiquitous expression . This restoration is complete in some instances ( e . g . , Figures 1 , 2 ) , although it is incomplete in others ( e . g . , with a paternally - derived transgene in embryos , Figure S2 ) . A simple explanation for the lack of complete restoration in some circumstances is that PRE activity varies in different tissues , and the eve 3 9 PRE is partially redundant with other PREs at some times in development . Ubiquitous expression of TER94 in early embryos , as well as some of the later ubiquitous CNS expression , is due to maternally loaded RNA . Consistent with this , expression in ovaries is robust , and , like early embryonic expression , is strongly repressed without Homie ( Figures 2 , S4 ) . Accompanying repression in both ovaries and embryos , trimethylation of H3K27 at TER94 - GFP is strongly increased when Homie is removed ( Figure 4 ) . Thus , without Homie , the eve Pc domain spreads into the adjacent gene , apparently shutting down expression . Homie is bound in vivo by most known insulator binding proteins , including Su ( Hw ) , CP190 , Mod ( mdg4 ) 67 . 2 , BEAF32 , CTCF , and GAF [ 27 , 33 ] . In a previous study , depletion of CTCF by RNAi in a cultured cell line caused a reduction in H3K27me3 levels throughout the eve locus [ 36 ] . The authors suggested that depleting CTCF altered the activity of insulators flanking eve , which led to a decrease in H3K27me3 . In contrast , we found that deletion of Homie did not cause a significant reduction in H3K27me3 levels in the eve - lacZ region of our pseudo - locus , either in embryos or in ovaries ( Figure 4 ) . There could be several possible reasons for this discrepancy , including the cell types assayed , and indirect effects of depleting CTCF . Tissue Specificity and Redundancy of PRE Activity With removal of Homie , the spreading of H3K27me3 in ovaries is reversed by deletion of the PRE ( Figure 4A , B ) . However , in embryos , this spreading is only partially reversed ( Figure 4C , D ) . A simple explanation for this is that additional PRE activity within the eve locus comes into play in embryos . Consistent with this , the eve promoter - proximal region has PRE - like properties . It causes pairing - sensitive silencing of mini - white in transgenes that carry it [ 51 ] , a property associated with most known PREs . Furthermore , it has consensus binding sites for several PRE - associated DNA binding proteins [ 8 , 51 ] , and it shares with the eve 3 9 PRE the ability to support positive epigenetic maintenance of enhancer activity from embryos to larvae within eve - positive neurons [ 51 ] . Perhaps the clearest evidence for redundant PRE activity within the eve locus is that the level of H3K27me3 at the eve - lacZ coding region is not significantly reduced when the 3 9 PRE is deleted . This is true in both embryos and ovaries . In contrast , spreading of the Pc domain into TER94 in ovaries requires the 3 9 PRE ( Figure 4 ) . Our data are consistent with the idea that PREs are the nucleation point for spreading of the H3K27me3 mark , and that PRE activity is regulated , so that PREs are differentially active in different tissues . Furthermore , because there may be a dynamic balance between active and repressive chromatin , maintaining a boundary between them may have different requirements at different chromosomal locations , and at different times in development . Insulators that are not required to maintain a boundary in one cell type may be required for that function in other cells , or at specific times in development , as previously suggested [ 34 ] . One reason for such differences may be regulated PRE activity . In some cases , spreading of repressive chromatin can be stopped by an active promoter [ 11 , 64 ] . In the case of the TER94 promoter , although it is robustly expressed , particularly in ovaries , this is not sufficient to stop the spreading of H3K27me3 in the absence of an insulator . This contrasts with the suggestion from recent genome - wide studies in both cultured cells and Drosophila that insulator protein function is generally not required to prevent spreading of H3K27me3 into active genes , or to maintain most normal gene expression [ 34 , 36 , 38 ] . Because many insulator proteins bind to overlapping sets of sites , it is likely that there is considerable redundancy in their function . Thus , knocking out any one of them may not reveal the full function of a majority of their binding sites . Enhancer Action from Within a Pc Domain It is intriguing that the eve locus is a Pc domain with well - defined boundaries that flank its extensive regulatory regions . Within chromosomal domains of the Drosophila bithorax complex ( BX - C ) , active enhancers prevent the establishment of repressive Pc - dependent chromatin in early embryos . Conversely , in tissues where such repressive chromatin has been established , such as in parts of the CNS and imaginal discs , later - acting enhancers are repressed [ 25 ] . Do similar mechanisms operate within the eve locus ? Extensive dissection of eve regulatory DNA has not identified enhancers that can drive expression outside the normal eve pattern , arguing against such a close analogy with the BX - C . However , in PcG mutants , eve is ectopically expressed throughout the late - stage embryonic CNS [ 50 , 54 ] , showing that PcG genes do negatively regulate eve , as they do the Hox complexes . In our previous studies of eve PRE activity , we found that in a transgenic context , both the 3 9 PRE and the PRE - like eve promoter region could facilitate positive maintenance of an eve CNS enhancer from embryonic to larval stages , as well as prevent ectopic expression in cells that normally do not express eve [ 51 ] . Unlike maintenance elements [ 65 ] in the BX - C , the eve 3 9 PRE was found to require the DNA binding PcG protein Pleiohomeotic rather than Trithorax - group members for posi - tive maintenance [ 51 ] . In this study , we also see evidence of a positive effect of the eve 3 9 PRE on enhancer activity . In this case , it facilitates TER94 - GFP expression in an eve pattern when Homie is removed ( Figure 1B : eve - like mesodermal and CNS expression are seen when Homie is removed , but are not seen when both Homie and the PRE are removed ) . One possible explanation for this is that eve enhancers have evolved to function within a Pc domain , and they may be better able to activate the TER94 promoter when the Pc domain spreads over it . In this view , PREs facilitate both the on state and the off state , yet the chromatin may be differently modified in the two cases . This model is similar to the ‘‘integration model’’ proposed for how heterochromatin can have a positive effect on the expression of genes that normally reside within it [ 66 ] . PRE Blocking by Insulators PLOS Genetics | www . plosgenetics . org 9 October 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 10 | e1003883 Homie’s Activity Relative to that of Other Drosophila and Mammalian Insulators Homie sits adjacent to the eve 3 9 PRE , an arrangement that is reminiscent of some boundaries in the BX - C . The mammalian homologs of eve , evx1 and evx2 , are located at the 3 9 end of the HOX - A and HOX - D clusters , respectively , suggesting that the ancestral eve locus was part of a Hox cluster [ 67 ] . Consistent with conservation of the eve insulator - PRE relationship , recent studies identified an enhancer - blocking activity between evx2 and Hoxd13 [ 68 ] , and a PRE in the HOX - D cluster [ 69 ] . The presence of a PRE near an insulator , with a promoter on the other side , may indicate a functionally important boundary between active and repressive chromatin domains . Previous studies showed that within the BX - C , neither scs nor gypsy could functionally replace Fab - 7 [ 70 ] , indicating that there are different classes or strengths of insulators . In these cases , the primary effects of insulator deletion was ectopic activation , due to early acting enhancers ( ‘‘initiators’’ ) ‘‘turning off’’ PREs through - out a chromatin domain delineated by insulators [ 26 , 71 ] . In our system , the major effect of insulator deletion is the spreading of the eve Pc domain , reminiscent of the shielding of transgenic reporter genes from repressive effects at some insertion sites [ 18 , 72 – 75 ] . Despite the differences in normal function , BX - C insulators can replace Homie in our assay , indicating some degree of universality in insulator function as a PRE blocker . However , our assays did reveal differences in effectiveness in carrying out this function . Specifically , scs’ showed slightly weaker activity than either gypsy , Fab - 7 , or Fab - 8 , while the activity of scs was highly orientation - dependent ( Figure 3 ) . Homie Blocks Enhancer - promoter Cross - talk , While Facilitating Enhancers that Lie Between It and the eve Promoter Deletion of Homie results in expression of TER94 - GFP in an eve pattern . In fact , the eve early embryonic stripe enhancers may access the TER94 promoter even when Homie is present , because with a paternal - only transgene , we sometimes see eve - like stripe expression from TER94 - GFP ( Figure S2B ‘‘intact t’gene’’ ) . However , at later stages of embryogenesis , we do not see eve - like expression in either the mesoderm , CNS , or APR unless Homie is deleted . Therefore , one of Homie’s functions is to prevent communication between the TER94 promoter and eve enhancers . Deletion of Homie , but not deletion of the PRE , also reduced eve - lacZ expression driven by the eve 3 9 enhancers ( Figures 5 , S5 ) . We considered the possibility that because the TER94 promoter has access to eve enhancers in the absence of Homie , the resulting promoter competition might reduce eve promoter activity . How - ever , in D Homie lines where we see TER94 expressed in eve stripes , there is no apparent bias in expression toward the 3 9 enhancers ( Figures 1B , S1A ) , arguing against this possibility . Furthermore , at later embryonic stages , eve promoter activity is reduced when both Homie and the PRE are removed ( in mesoderm , CNS , and APR , which are all the tissues where eve is expressed at these stages , Figure 5A ) , but this is not accompanied by TER94 - GFP expression in an eve pattern ( Figures 1B , S1A ) . Finally , when the TER94 promoter is removed along with Homie , pattern disruptions persist ( Figure 5B ) . While we cannot rule out competition with other promoters in the genome , these lines of evidence together suggest that promoter competition is unlikely to be responsible for this effect . A second possible explanation for the reduction in eve 3 9 enhancer - promoter communication when Homie is deleted is that a 3 - dimensional ( 3 - D ) conformation that allows the eve promoter to better access the 3 9 enhancers is stabilized by the presence of Homie . One possible conformation is a loop between the eve promoter region and Homie ( Figure 6 ) . Although we have not tested this directly , evidence consistent with this model is that activation of promoters , including the eve promoter , by down - stream Gal4 binding sites can be facilitated by heterologous insulators in a model transgene assay [ 76 ] . This possible pairing of Homie with the eve promoter region would result in a loop that would bring the 3 9 enhancers in closer proximity to the promoter . Such a model is similar to that proposed for the 3 - D organization of regulatory regions upstream of the Abd - B gene [ 25 ] . If such loops are anchored to large clusters of insulator proteins , perhaps within insulator bodies , this may serve as a 3 - D barrier that separates distinct chromatin domains , and occludes interactions between regulatory elements located on opposite sides of the insulator . At the same time , otherwise distant elements can be brought closer together , facilitating specific enhancer - promoter contacts , particularly if those elements are brought to the same side of the 3 - D barrier . Implications for Other Insulators and PREs throughout the Genome The activities of Homie and the eve PRE are largely interchangeable with those of other insulators and PREs , respectively , in our assay system . Previous studies showed that Homie and the eve PRE have the canonical properties of insulators Figure 6 . Model of the effects of Homie deletion on chromo - some conformation and chromatin structure . At the top , Homie is present , and separates the eve Pc domain ( blue ) from the TER94 locus , which is constitutively in active chromatin ( orange ) . The eve enhancers both 5 9 and 3 9 of the eve start site efficiently activate the eve promoter , and the TER94 enhancers activate the TER94 promoter . Below , when Homie is removed , Pc - dependent chromatin spreads into the TER94 locus , preventing its activation by TER94 enhancers , but allowing eve enhancers to activate it . At the same time , eve 3 9 enhancers interact with the eve promoter less efficiently , due to a change in chromosome conformation . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pgen . 1003883 . g006 PRE Blocking by Insulators PLOS Genetics | www . plosgenetics . org 10 October 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 10 | e1003883 and PREs when tested in other contexts [ 51 , 55 ] . Thus , our results are likely to be applicable to many such elements throughout the genome . In particular , a common function of insulators is likely to be to limit the action of PRE - dependent repressive chromatin . Genome - wide studies using RNAi to knock down specific insulator proteins suggested that insulators may not typically be required in their normal context either to block enhancer - promoter cross - talk or to prevent the spread of repressive chromatin [ 34 , 36 ] . Our results suggest that Homie is critically important in its normal context for just such activities , functionally separating the loci on either side . Importantly , other insulators function in place of Homie . This suggests that the activities of insulators defined in model transgene assays do in fact correspond to their normal functions . In particular , as with Homie and the TER94 promoter , the tendency of insulator proteins to cluster just upstream of promoters suggests that one of their typical functions is to shield basal promoters from the effects of upstream CRMs , especially PREs . Further , our finding that insulators facilitate enhancer - promoter communication in this context suggests that their ability to organize chromosomal conformations that augment appropriate transcription is also likely to be a common mode of endogenous insulator function . Materials and Methods Plasmid Construction and Transgene Production The eve - TER94 locus construct ( ‘‘intact t’gene’’ in figures ) was created as follows ( detailed sequence coordinates are given in Figure S6 ) . DNA from 2 6 . 4 kb to + 166 bp relative to the eve TSS was fused to the lacZ coding region . The 3 9 end of the lacZ coding region was fused to DNA from + 1 . 3 to + 11 . 4 kb , which includes the eve poly - A signal , and extends into the 3rd exon of TER94 . This was joined with the EGFP coding region , followed by the poly - A signal of a – tubulin . The entire construct was placed between two inverted attB sequences [ 63 , 77 ] . The following deletions were then made in this construct : from + 8 . 4 to + 9 . 2 kb for D PRE , from + 8 . 4 to + 9 . 7 kb for D Homie D PRE , and from + 9 . 2 to + 9 . 7 kb for D Homie . To test promoter competition between eve and TER94 , DNA from 2 7 . 4 to + 8 . 6 kb relative to the eve TSS was used , with the eve coding region replaced by that of lacZ , as described above . This construct does not contain the TER94 promoter . Replacements of Homie with either heterologous insulators or phage l DNA were created using the D Homie construct , and adding DNA fragments corresponding to gypsy [ 78 ] , Fab - 7 [ 79 – 82 ] , Fab - 8 [ 83 , 84 ] , scs [ 85 , 86 ] , scs’ [ 85 , 86 ] , or l DNA ( see Figure S6 for details ) . For testing repression activity of heterologous PREs , either the engrailed 181PRE [ 87 ] or the bxd PRE [ 88 ] were inserted into the D Homie D PRE construct at the site of deletion . For testing Homie activity against these PREs , either the en PRE or the bxd PRE were inserted into the D PRE construct at the site of deletion . All transgenic lines were made using Q C31 recombinase - mediated cassette exchange ( RMCE ) [ 63 ] . Three alternative attP target sites were used , at cytological locations 95E5 , 74A2 , and 30B5 . The direction of each insertion was determined by PCR . Both directions were analyzed if obtained . Some variations with insertion site were found , as described in Results . Analysis of Gene Expression in Embryos and Ovaries Embryos were collected at time points described in figure legends , and subjected to in situ hybridization using DIG - labeled anti - sense RNA probes against either lacZ or GFP . Expression patterns were visualized by alkaline phosphatase - conjugated anti - DIG with BCIP and NBT as substrates ( Roche Applied Science ) . GFP expression was detected by fluorescence microscopy in ovaries dissected from 1 – 2 day - old females . In some cases , expression was also detected using anti - GFP antibody staining ( Roche Applied Science ) , analyzed by confocal microscopy ( Zeiss ) of material in DAPI - containing mounting medium . Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Ovaries were dissected from 2 – 3 day - old females . Fifty ovaries were cross - linked in 1 . 8 % formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min . After sonication so as to produce a peak near 500 bp in the DNA fragment size distribution , isolated chromatin was immunoprecip - itated with anti - H3K27me3 ( EMD Millipore ) , and with rabbit IgG ( Jackson ImmunoResearch ) as a negative control . Precipitated chromatin samples were collected using ProteinG magnetic beads ( EMD Millipore ) . Immunoprecipitated DNA samples were dissolved in 20 – 50 m l TE , and 1 m l was used for each PCR reaction . Either duplicate or triplicate samples were analyzed by real - time PCR ( Life Technologies , StepOnePlus ) , using SYBR Green Master Mix with ROX dye ( Roche Applied Science ) . Data were analyzed with StepOne software ( Life Technologies ) , using the standard curve method . Standard deviations were calculated using Excel software ( Microsoft ) . Embryo ChIP analysis was described previously [ 51 ] , except that results were quantified by real - time PCR , as described above for ovary analysis . Specific ChIP signals were determined by subtracting the average non - specific IgG signal from the average a - H3K27me3 signal , with standard deviations combined by adding . Errors bars for specific signals relative to that of endogenous eve were determined by adding the relative errors in quadrature ; that is , by taking the sum of the squares of the relative standard deviations ( the standard deviations divided by their respective averages ) to give the square of the relative standard deviation of the ratio . The following primers were used : TCCAGTCCGGA - TAACTCCTTGAAC and TGTAGAACTCCTTCTCCAAGC - GAC for the endogenous eve coding region , TGAAGC - CACCGCGTGGTATTCTTA and TTTGGACATGATCT - CCGGTCCGTT for the endogenous TER94 coding region , GCTGTGCCGAAATGGTCCATCAAA and TACTGAC - GAAACGCCTGCCAGTAT for the transgenic eve - lacZ coding region , and GGGCACAAGCTGGAGTACAACTACAA and TGGCGGATCTTGAAGTTCACCTTG for the transgenic TER94 - GFP coding region . RT - PCR Total RNA was purified from either five pairs of ovaries from 2 – 3 day - old females or 10 – 20 m l of dechorionated embryos for each data point , using an RNA purification kit ( Roche Applied Science ) . RNA was eluted in 50 – 100 m l elution buffer and stored at 2 80 u C . cDNA was synthesized using the Transcriptor first strand cDNA synthesis kit ( Roche Applied Science ) , and quantified by real - time PCR as described above . A constitutively expressed RNA , RpL32 ( a . k . a . RP49 ) , was used to normalize GFP RNA levels . The primers listed above for TER94 - GFP were used for GFP , and AAGCCCAAGGGTATCGACAACAGA and TGCACCAGGAACTTCTTGAATCCG were used for RpL32 . Supporting Information Figure S1 Homie shields the TER94 promoter from eve PRE activity . A , B : similar effects on TER94 promoter activity are seen at two chromosomal landing sites ( different from that used in Figure 1 ) , where deletion of Homie causes a loss of ubiquitous PRE Blocking by Insulators PLOS Genetics | www . plosgenetics . org 11 October 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 10 | e1003883 activity , and further deletion of the PRE restores ubiquitous expression . Some differences are seen at the landing site shown in B , mostly attributable to a lower expression level from all three transgenes , which makes the eve - like expression ( visible in the other lines when Homie is deleted ) difficult to detect . The attP sites used are at cytological locations 74A2 ( A ) and 30B5 ( B ) . A longer staining reaction time than that used in B , ‘‘ D Homie’’ , showed both expression in stripes and in eve - expressing cells of the mesoderm ( not shown ) . ( TIF ) Figure S2 When the transgenic eve - TER94 locus is heterozygous and paternally derived , embryonic TER94 - GFP expression is repressed in the absence of Homie as it is in ovaries , but this repression is not dependent on the 3 9 PRE . Expression of GFP RNA in the transgenic lines indicated on the left from two different transgene landing sites ( in A and B ) is visualized at 3 different embryonic stages ( indicated along the top ) by in situ hybridization . The levels of GFP RNA ( extracted from 2 – 3 hr - old embryos ) , quantified in triplicate , are show on the right ( averages with standard deviations , see Materials and Methods ) . A : In the top 3 rows and in the graph , expression is exclusively zygotic ( mothers did not carry a transgene ; the paternal transgene is at the same insertion site , 95E5 , as that shown in Figure 1 ) , while the bottom row shows , for comparison , maternal plus zygotic expression ( both mothers and fathers were homozygous for the transgene ) when Homie is deleted . Note that without Homie , the expression pattern is similar ( albeit weaker ) in heterozygotes as in homozygotes , consistent with the maternal contribution being repressed in the absence of Homie . This similarity includes eve - like stripes at all 3 stages , as well as eve - like mesodermal expression ( dots in the dorsal - most part of each segment near the center of the germ - band extended embryo at stage 11 ) . The quantitation shown in the graph suggests that ubiquitous zygotic expression is repressed when Homie is deleted . However , unlike for maternally derived expression ( as shown in Figures 1 , S1 , and 2 ) , this repression is not dependent on the PRE . This is consistent with there being other PREs that are active in embryos , possibly within the transgenic eve locus ( see Results and Discussion ) . B : zygotic expression from a second transgene landing site ( cytological location 74A2 ) . Note that at this landing site , eve - like stripe expression is present from the intact transgene , indicating that some eve enhancers can work on the TER94 promoter when Homie is present , at least at some landing sites . Quantitation , shown in the graph , indicates that overall zygotic expression is reduced when Homie is deleted , consistent with repression of ubiquitous expression driven by TER94 enhancers present in the transgene . As with the other landing site , this repression is not dependent on the PRE , but may be due to redundant PRE activity . ( TIF ) Figure S3 TER94 - GFP is expressed throughout oogenesis in both germ cells and somatic epithelial follicle cells . Ovarioles dissected from female flies ( carrying transgenic TER94 - GFP in the context of the transgene diagrammed in Figure 1A inserted at cytological location 95E5 ) aged 24 – 48 hours after eclosion were stained using antibodies to GFP ( red ) and DAPI ( blue ) . Individual egg chambers were optically sectioned using confocal microscopy . Imaging of the surface ( left column ) shows mostly ovarian follicle cells , while imaging of the interior ( right column ) shows ovarian follicle cells at the periphery , and nurse cells and the oocyte in the central region . Note that GFP is strongly expressed in all cells from the intact transgene ( top row ) , but not significantly above background in any cells when Homie is deleted from the transgene ( bottom row ) . ( TIF ) Figure S4 Homie blocks PRE action in ovaries . Fluorescence in ovarioles from transgenic lines carrying the indicated transgenes , at two different chromosomal insertion sites ( left column , cytological location 74A2 ; right column , 30B5 ) , distinct from that shown in Figure 2 ( corresponding to those shown in Figure S1 ) . Note the same trend , wherein deletion of Homie causes severe repression of fluorescence from transgenic TER94 - GFP , while additional deletion of the PRE causes restoration of TER94 promoter activity . The graph at the bottom shows , on a log scale , the results of quantitation , as in Figure 2 , of GFP RNA from ovaries of the line shown above it in the same column . Note that GFP RNA levels decrease about 1000 - fold when Homie is deleted , and are partially restored ( about 200 - fold ) by additional deletion of the PRE . ( TIF ) Figure S5 Homie facilitates eve 3 9 enhancer action on the eve promoter . Expression of lacZ RNA driven by the eve promoter from the transgene diagrammed in Figure 1A and its derivatives was monitored by in situ hybridization . A , B : results from two different transgene landing sites ( cytological locations 74E2 and 30B5 , respectively ) , distinct from that shown in Figure 5A . Representative embryos at three stages are shown . Note that when Homie is deleted ( ‘‘ D Homie’’ ) , stripes 1 , 4 , 5 , and 6 are weakened relative to stripes 2 , 3 , and 7 ( left column , stage 5 ) . This effect is still seen when both Homie and the PRE are deleted ( ‘‘ D Homie D PRE’’ ) , and occurs at both landing sites . In addition , mesodermal expression at stage 11 ( middle column ) , as well as CNS and APR expression at stage 13 ( right column ) , are weakened when Homie is deleted . These effects also persist when both Homie and the PRE are deleted , and are seen at both landing sites . C : results from two of the Homie - replacement lines shown in Figure 3 . Note that gypsy , but not scs , facilitates 3 9 enhancer activity . ( TIF ) Figure S6 Construct details .
