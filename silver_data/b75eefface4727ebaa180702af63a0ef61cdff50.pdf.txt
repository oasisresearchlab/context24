Abstract Background Accurate estimates of the prevalence of infections play an important role in COVID - 19 surveillance . Older people are known to have higher risks of severe outcomes after infection , but whether they also have a higher infection rate remains unclear . To obtain estimates of COVID - 19 prevalence among older people , we synthesized evidence from RT - PCR - based prevalence and serological studies . Methods We conducted a scoping review using a comprehensive search of MEDLINE ( Ovid ) , Embase ( Ovid ) , Europe PMC , ClinicalTrials . gov , and the WHO COVID - 19 Research Database from December 2019 to Oct 2022 . We included population - based cross - sectional ( sero ) prevalence studies among older people ( i . e . , people aged > = 65 + / - 5 years ) who were tested for SARS - CoV - 2 infection using RT - PCR tests , antigen tests , or serological tests . Studies that were conducted solely in institutional housing were excluded . Eligible studies were extracted and critically appraised . We described and mapped the prevalence ( tested by RT - PCR or antigen tests ) and seroprevalence ( tested by serological tests ) by geographical area and time . We then compared the estimated prevalence with WHO - reported prevalence and the prevalence among younger age groups from the same study . Results We identified 202 ( sero ) prevalence estimates from 126 studies , covering 50 countries up to October 2022 . Of the 126 studies , 28 studies estimated RT - PCR - based prevalence ; 104 studies estimated seroprevalence , ranging from 0 % in Jordan to 22 . 5 % in the United States in 2020 , from 0 . 41 % in Brazil to 98 % in Chile in 2021 . In the year 2020 , prevalence of COVID - 19 ranged from 0 . 0006 % in China , to 52 . 8 % in Brazil , while in 2021 , prevalence ranged from 0 . 06 % in England to 41 . 1 % in Brazil . The ratio of the reported prevalence to estimated prevalence ranged from < 0 . 01 to 77 . 50 , where 86 % ( 24 / 28 ) studies estimated a .

One third of studies ( 32 % , 9 / 28 ) estimated a higher prevalence in older people compared with younger people . Conclusions Our findings suggest that underreporting of COVID - 19 cases among older people may exist extensively worldwide . Compared with younger groups , older people were less likely to be infected with COVID - 19 in two thirds of the studies through the first two years of the pandemic .

As of March 10 , 2023 , 676 , 609 , 955 cases and 6 , 881 , 955 deaths have been reported 2 . However , the reported cases may not capture the actual burden of the pandemic , partially due to limited test availability and accessibility 3 , 4 , asymptomatic infections 5 , and the extensive allocation of self - test kits 6 . For instance , according to a global survey covering respondents from Africa , Americas , Eastern Mediterranean , Europe , Southeast Asia , and Western Pacific , self - testing were available in 101 out of 139 countries in early 2022 7 . COVID - 19 seroprevalence and prevalence studies across the world have described the spread of the virus over time and in different regions , age - groups and socioeconomic profiles . Prevalence studies estimate prevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 virus RNA ( based on nucleic acid amplification tests , or NAAT in short ) or antigen of SARS - CoV - 2 ( antigen based ) . Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) is the most widely used method among NAATs . It is one of the most accurate tests of active infections but more expensive and time - consuming than antigen tests , which are more accessible alternatives but less accurate . Seroprevalence studies estimate prevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies as a result of vaccination or infection , depending on the types of antibodies . Antibody remains detectable months after infection or vaccination 8 . Compared with RT - PCR tests , both antibody and antigen tests can be conducted quicker and cheaper , thus are more commonly used . Because of their ability to detect past infection or vaccination weeks or months ago , antibody tests have been used to estimate COVID - 19 prevalence , as well as to estimate the extent of case underreporting 9 , 10 . However , based on WHO’s definition 11 , a confirmed case is either an individual with a positive NAAT result or a suspect case , based on clinical and / or epidemiological criteria , with a positive antigen result . Literature suggested that antibody tests tend to provide a higher positivity rate than PCR tests 12 . Using a seroprevalence - based estimate of prevalence may lead to a higher estimate of COVID - 19 infections . No review has analyzed PCR - based prevalence studies at the initiation of this study . .

However , whether older people are also more vulnerable to COVID - 19 infection itself remains unclear . Since a recent review from Bergeri et al has analyzed seroprevalence studies comprehensively 10 , in this review we aim to 1 ) describe COVID - 19 seroprevalence and prevalence among older people across region and time , 2 ) assess the extent of underestimation of COVID - 19 infections based on prevalence studies , and 3 ) compare the prevalence between older people and younger groups . Methods Information sources and search strategy We searched the following electronic databases : MEDLINE ( Ovid ) , Embase ( Ovid ) , and Europe PMC from December 2019 to Oct 19 , 2022 . Embase and Europe PMC were searched to include preprints . We also searched ClinicalTrials . gov and the WHO COVID - 19 Research Database to include COVID - 19 prevalence studies registered in these databases . Backward and forward citation searching on included studies was conducted . The comprehensive search strategies with MeSH terms are summarized in Table 1 . For database where MeSH terms were not available , following keywords are searched : ( “COVID - 19” or “SARS - CoV - 2” or “coronavirus” ) and ( “prevalence” or “incidence” or “seroprevalence” ) and ( “covid - 19 testing” or “nucleic acid test” or “antigen test” or “rapid test” or “antibody” or “PCR” or “RT - PCR” or “polymerase chain reaction” ) and ( “older people” or “older adult” or “aged people” ) . The review protocol 16 is registered on Open Science Framework 17 ( Registration DOI : doi . org / 10 . 17605 / OSF . IO / 37RZS ) . Eligibility criteria This review included cross ‐ sectional or repeated cross ‐ sectional studies using molecular tests , antigen tests , or serological tests ( i . e . , antibody tests ) to estimate the prevalence and seroprevalence of COVID - 19 .

Studies were excluded if the study : ( i ) was not a cross ‐ sectional study , ( ii ) did not report prevalence or seroprevalence specifically among the older population , ( iii ) restricted to a specific group of participants only ( e . g . , people living in residential facilities such as long - term care facilities or nursing homes , or having certain underlying condition such as cardiovascular diseases ) , and ( iv ) had a sample size less than 100 For the purpose of our review , older populations were defined as people with a minimum age of 65 ± 5 years . Studies using convenience sampling were also included to gather information as thorough as possible . Only literature with a title and abstract written in English were included . Because of the rapidly evolving state of the COVID - 19 pandemic , non - peer - reviewed articles such as pre - prints and scientific reports were included . Conference proceedings alone were excluded . Study selection and data extraction All reference management were performed in Covidence 18 . After the removal of duplicates , titles and abstracts of all search results were assessed for inclusion against our eligibility criteria . Prior to the screening of title and abstract , the screening form was calibrated through pilot testing 19 with a random sample of 25 records from the literature search by two independent reviewers . At the first stage , two reviewers JL and PS screened all titles and abstracts independently to decide if the record was potentially eligible , irrelevant , or of indeterminate relevance . All potentially eligible records and those of indeterminate relevance were retrieved and screened at the full - text level . Discrepancies were resolved by discussion and consensus between the two reviewers or by a third - party decision . Information of the included studies was extracted according to a pre - specified data extraction form ( Table 2 ) . Prevalence of younger age group from the same study was also extracted if available . We did not extract vaccination .

Two reviewers extracted data independently and consensus was reached afterwards . Statistical analyses A narrative description of the prevalence and seroprevalence studies was presented by geographical region and time . For prevalence studies , we compared the prevalence of COVID - 19 based on included studies with reported prevalence in the same country . The reported prevalence was calculated by the reported cases among people aged 65 and above during the sample collection period reported by WHO 23 , divided by total population size aged 65 and above in 2021 , reported by United Nations , World Population Prospects 24 . If age - specific cases were not available in a country , we would use all - age prevalence at the same time as a comparator . Analyses were conducted with R language 25 . Results Eligible evaluations 6 , 248 records were identified in the databases after the comprehensive search as of October 19 , 2022 . After automatically removing the duplicates by Covidence , 5 , 163 records were screened . 4 , 958 records were excluded in the title and abstract screening ; and 205 records retrieved for full text . Fifty - nine articles were excluded in the full - text screening due to off - target population ( n = 29 ) , off - target measurement ( n = 15 ) , inadequate sample size ( n = 8 ) , or duplicates ( n = 7 ) . In total , 126 unique studies were retrieved in 146 records ( Figure 1 ) . In these 126 studies , 202 estimates of ( sero - ) prevalence were extracted . The information extracted for the eligible studies is summarized in Supplementary Table . General description of the studies Of the 126 included studies , samples of 85 studies were collected in 2020 , 11 were collected in 2021 , 1 was collected in 2022 , and 29 were collected in multiple rounds across 2020 - 2022 . The prevalence and seroprevalence estimates over time are shown in Figure 2 . Five studies were preprints or scientific reports , .

Regions with the most studies were Europe ( n = 48 ) , North America ( n = 30 ) , and Asia ( n = 28 ) . Only 7 studies were conducted in Africa and 13 studies in South America ( Figure 3 and 4 ) . No identified studies were conducted in Oceania . Countries with most studies are the United States ( 26 unique studies with 39 estimates ) , India ( 11 unique studies with 19 estimates ) , and Brazil ( 8 unique studies with 13 estimates ) . Ninety studies were prospective cross - sectional studies , 34 studies were retrospective cross - sectional studies , and 2 studies collected seroprevalence prospectively whereas the reported PCR - based prevalence data was retrieved retrospectively from other sources . Half ( n = 66 , 52 % ) of the studies were randomly sampled from the general population . For non - randomly sampled studies , 15 studies were sampled from the general population , 14 studies were based on samples for COVID - 19 testing , and 26 studies were based on samples for other reasons ( e . g . , routine laboratory tests ) . Three studies had a different sample scheme for prevalence and seroprevalence 26 – 28 , and one study reported in three publications sampling from the general population randomly in Russia 29 but non - randomly in the Kyrgyz Republic 30 and the Republic of Belarus 31 . The age ranges for older participants were defined as 60 years and above ( n = 69 studies ) , 65 and above ( n = 46 studies ) , and 70 and above ( n = 7 studies ) . Nineteen studies measured prevalence of COVID - 19 only , 95 studies measured seroprevalence ( i . e . , antibody level ) only , and 9 studies measured both prevalence and seroprevalence . Three studies 32 – 34 used a mixture of PCR , antibody , and / or self - reported COVID - 19 history . For the 28 studies reporting COVID - 19 prevalence , 26 studies were based on RT - PCR tests ( on swab or blood samples , or both ) , one study was based on an antigen test 35 , and one study was based on both antigen and RT - PCR tests 36 . For studies of seroprevalence , most studies used testing methods targeting on either IgA , IgM , or IgG . Two studies used anti - RBD antibodies 37 , 38 , and two studies changed targeting antibody in the middle of the sample collection 34 , 39 . .

All studies were conducted in 2020 or 2021 , except for REACT - 1 where the most recent round published was conducted in February and March 2022 40 . The prevalence of COVID - 19 ranged diversely , from 0 . 006 % 41 in China to 52 . 8 % 42 in Brazil in 2020 , and from 0 . 04 % 43 in the UK to 41 . 1 % 44 in Brazil in 2021 . Study 30 40 , 43 , 45 – 47 and Study 89 48 had multiple rounds of sample collection . For Study 30 in England , the prevalence measurement started from May 2020 , decreased in July – September 2020 , increased thereafter until January 2022 , and decreased in the latest round available in March 2022 ( round 18 ) . For Study 89 in South Africa , four rounds of sample collection were conducted monthly from March 2020 . Prevalence decreased in April and May 2020 and increased dramatically ( from 1 . 8 % to 15 % ) in June 2020 . The comparison with prevalence in younger age groups is represented in Table 3 and Figure 5 . 32 % studies ( 9 / 28 , 12 / 42 estimates ) found a higher infection prevalence among older people compared with younger people . Four studies estimated significantly higher prevalence among the older people , while 6 studies estimated significantly lower prevalence . The comparison between study - based estimates and WHO - reported estimates are as shown in Table 3 and Figure 5 . For seven of the included prevalence studies 27 , 48 – 53 ( marked with * in Table 3 ) , WHO reported daily cumulative COVID - 19 cases were not available when stratified by age group , thus all - ages prevalence was used as a comparator . Out of the 28 studies , 4 studies from England 40 , 43 , 45 – 47 , United States 54 , 55 , and Hungary 56 reported a lower prevalence compared to the reported estimates ( ratio of study - based estimates versus WHO reported estimates : 1 . 02 - 77 . 5 ) . Twenty - three studies reported higher prevalence compared to the WHO reported estimates ( ratio : < 0 . 01 ~ 0 . 53 ) , and 14 studies ( 50 % ) reported at least ten times higher prevalence compared to WHO figures . .

Twenty - seven studies were national studies whereas 66 studies were regional or sub - national studies . In 2020 , seroprevalence was estimated ranging from 0 % in Jordan 57 to 22 . 5 % in United States 58 , from 0 . 41 % in Brazil 59 to 98 % in Chile 60 in 2021 . Twenty - five studies reported multiple rounds of sample collection . The temporal trend of COVID - 19 seroprevalence for 23 of the studies is shown in Figure 2 . Two studies 61 , 62 were excluded as they only reported adjusted estimates for subgroups . Discussion This review covers prevalence estimates from 50 countries or regions from January 2020 to March 2022 , but prevalence in these areas only represent a small part of the COVID - 19 infection and vaccination among older adults in the world . Along with other reviews 63 , 64 , this scoping review shows that prevalence and seroprevalence studies were concentrated in several high - resource countries or areas such as the United States and Europe . Although our search included most of 2022 , most included studies were conducted in 2020 and 2021 ; this may have reflected an urgent need to obtain prevalence estimates early on in the pandemic as well as the time it takes for the publishing process . Twelve out of 42 estimates of prevalence were higher in older people , which indicates that the older adults were more likely to get infected in these areas . For the rest ( 30 / 42 estimates ) , a lower prevalence among older adults was observed comparing with younger groups in these regions during the sample collection time . Other primary studies and literature reviews also show a divergent age effect on infection . Zhang et al 65 found that the infection rate was higher in older adults than people aged 15 to 64 years in February 2020 while Rumain et al 66 found a higher prevalence among adolescents in summer 2020 . Bergeri et al 10 found a lower prevalence among people aged 0 to 9 years 10 to 19 , and 60 and above across 2020 - 2022 , comparing with young adults aged 20 to 29 years . A modeling study in Brazil 67 showed little age effect in the difference of infection risks between regions . Nevertheless , studies have been .

Policies and measurements have been advocated and implemented to protect older people 68 across the pandemic , however , the efficiency remains concerning in some countries . Regardless of the age group , we found universal discrepancies between study - based prevalence and WHO reported prevalence where most of the studies reported a much higher prevalence . Besides underreporting , alternative reasons such as nonrepresentative population selection , lack of adjustment for test performance and study design , and delay of case reporting , may also lead to the difference . For example , participants in Study 104 41 were individuals who were tested for COVID - 19 in Zhongnan hospital of Wuhan University , and tests were only available for people with symptoms 69 , which may cause the prevalence in the study population to be significantly higher than the prevalence among general population . Nevertheless , infections estimated based on seroprevalence were consistently found to exceed the reported cases globally 9 , 10 , 70 – 72 . Monitoring current infection rate helps scientists and the public to monitor the spread of the disease and to prevent health services shortage due to outbreaks . Therefore , inaccurate estimation of the prevalence can be misleading to decision makers and the allocation of health services . Our review also calls for attention on the importance of reporting participants’ age distribution in COVID - 19 studies . Comparing with previous reviews 9 , 10 , fewer studies were included in our review due to lack of age information . This can also be seen from Bergeri et al’s review 10 and Bobrovitz et al’s review 9 where only 23 % ( 117 / 513 ) and 21 % ( 127 / 605 ) of the studies reported seroprevalence of the older adults . This scoping review focuses on presenting prevalence and seroprevalence of COVID - 19 among the older adults . However , this review does have limitations . This review only searched for English - language studies until October 2022 , which may omit important and the most recent materials . Seventy - six studies had age thresholds different from the WHO threshold of 65 years ( mostly 60 years ) , which may lead to .

For seven of the included prevalence studies , WHO - reported daily cumulative COVID - 19 cases were not available when stratified by age group for comparison . Thus , for these studies we could not directly compare the study - based and reported prevalence for older people . Conclusions The prevalence and seroprevalence of COVID - 19 have been crucial indicators of COVID - 19 management . This review describes these two indicators among one of the most vulnerable populations , the older adults . Prevalence of COVID - 19 ranges from 0 . 0006 % in 2020 in a Chinese study to 52 . 8 % in mid 2020 in a Brazilian study , and seroprevalence ranges from 0 in August 2020 in a Jordan study to 98 % in late 2021 in a Chile study . Prevalence among the older adults were higher in one third of the studies compared with the younger group , but in most countries , both far exceeded WHO reported prevalence . .
