Recent studies have highlighted the central role of the 19 nucleus in sensing mechanical cues , but they only focus on short periods of time , and so far , 20 whether cells can adapt to prolonged confinement remains unknown . Here , we reveal the 21 unsuspected role of mitosis in the long - term adaptation of nuclei to prolonged uniaxial confinement . 22 For the colorectal cancer cell line investigated , following the first confined cell division , a new 23 homeostatic state was reached by nuclei : they were smaller , and had reset the tension of their 24 2 envelope . This adaptation through mitosis relied both on the nuclear tension sensor cPLA2 and the 25 contractility machinery . We report for the first time a mechano - adaptation during mitosis , a process 26 that could be crucial to adapt to stresses in the tumor microenvironment . We therefore anticipate 27 that our work could provide new insight into cancer cell plasticity and cancer relapse . 28 Significance Statement 29 Most cell types undergo significant deformation throughout their life cycles . Immune cells must 30 deform to navigate through dense matrices , while cancer cells in solid tumors experience 31 squeezing from neighboring cells . The nucleus , central for many cell function , is the stiffest and 32 largest organelle . Understanding its long - term response to spatial constraints is hence crucial yet 33 largely unexplored . 34 In this study , we investigate how a colorectal cancer cell line adapts to prolonged confined 35 environments , with a particular focus on nuclear dynamics under continuous squeezing . 36 Our groundbreaking findings reveal for the first time a mechano - adaptation during mitosis leading 37 to a decrease in nuclear size . 38 This research contributes to the fundamental understanding of cellular mechanosensing , opening 39 new avenues for cancer biology research . 40 41 3 Main Text 42 Introduction 43 The response of cancer cells to modifications in their microenvironmental mechanics has drawn 44 attention over the last decades , since pioneering studies have shown that mechanics play an 45 important role in the malignant transformation of cells during tumor progression and dissemination 46 ( 1 , 2 ) . It is now acknowledged that changes in mechanical properties of the tumor microenvironment 47 ( densification and stiffening of the extracellular matrix , mechanical compression ) foster a malignant 48 and invasive phenotype ( 3 ) together with a decrease in cell proliferation ( 4 , 5 ) , and changes in 49 cancer cell gene expression ( 6 , 7 ) . Hence , alleviating mechanical stress is now envisioned as an 50 interesting therapeutic strategy ( 8 ‚Äì 10 ) . To better target the adaptation of cancer cells to mechanical 51 stress , their response under confinement has been extensively studied . Several groups identified 52 an alteration of cell mitosis under such confined situations ( 11 , 12 ) , with modified cell cycle 53 progression and division ( 13 ) , the presence of multi - daughter events , daughter cells of unequal 54 size , and induction of cell death ( 14 ) . Moreover , such flattening was shown to promote the G1 - S 55 transition ( 15 ) , as well as the G2 - M transition ( 16 ) , thus fostering cell cycle progression . Under such 56 confined conditions , the nucleus was highlighted as a mechanosensor ( 17 ‚Äì 19 ) , triggering a 57 mechanism of nuclear repair ( 20 ) and rescue of DNA damage ( 21 ) . Upon squeezing , the nucleus 58 shortly unfolds its inner lamin envelope , activating the cytosolic phospholipase A2 ( cPLA2 ) - 59 Arachidonic acid ( AA ) pathway ( 17 ) , as well as myosin II contractility and switches towards a motile 60 phenotype ( 18 ) . Nuclear blebs and chromatin herniation can also occur , leading to transient events 61 of nuclear rupture and repair ( 20 , 22 ) . However , all these data focus on short - term cellular response 62 to confinement , and studying cancer cell fate under several days of confinement remains 63 challenging . 64 4 In this study , we investigated whether cells survive and adapt to prolonged squeezing . We showed 65 that they do survive thanks to a global nuclear adaptation that takes place in mitosis . We 66 demonstrated that nuclei relax the applied stress at mitosis by decreasing both their nuclear volume 67 and envelope tension . Both the tension sensor cPLA2 and the contractility machinery were required 68 to achieve proper adaptation . All these changes were conserved by the daughter cells of the next 69 generations , establishing a new state of nuclear homeostasis . Together our results reveal a 70 mechano - adaptation mechanism during mitosis , leading to a decrease in nuclear size . . 71 Results 72 Cancer cells adapt and survive different levels of prolonged confinement by altering their 73 nuclear volume . 74 To investigate whether and how cells adapt to prolonged squeezing , we modified our previously 75 published agarose - based confiner ( 23 ) , based on a single level of confinement , to subject a cell 76 population to multiple levels of confinement simultaneously ( Fig . 1A ) . This system enabled us to 77 impose four different levels of uniaxial deformations ( with four different heights from 3 to 9 ¬µm , with 78 a central control zone where no deformation was imposed , Fig . 1B - C ) . After 2 and 24 h , cells 79 displayed a constant decrease in cell and nuclear height according to the levels of confinement 80 ( Fig . 1D - E , see Materials & Methods for the measure principle ) , corresponding to an imposed initial 81 nuclear deformation along the z - direction ( ùúÄ ùëÅùëß ) from 41 ¬± 3 % to 70 ¬± 2 % for slight to very strong 82 confinement , respectively ( Fig . 1F ) . 83 We first focus on cell nuclear - projected area and nuclear volume . Different time points were chose . 84 First , 2 h to confirm the lack of nuclear volume adaptation already reported for an imposed 85 deformation of the order of the hour ( 17 , 18 ) , then 24 h , which corresponds to the cell cycle duration 86 of the HT - 29 cell line used in this study . We saw that at 2 h of confinement , the nuclear - projected 87 area increased with the level of confinement ( Fig . 1E , G ) . The volume of each nucleus , computed 88 5 by approximating the shape of the nucleus to a cylinder remained constant for all imposed 89 deformations ( Fig . 1H , squares ) . Intriguingly , at 24 h of confinement , the nuclear - projected area 90 decreased , resembling that of the control condition ( Fig . 1G , triangles ) . This decrease in nuclear - 91 projected area corresponded to a proportional decrease in nuclear volume after 24 h of confinement 92 ( Fig . 1H triangles ) , with a loss of nuclear volume from 20 ¬± 6 % to 34 ¬± 15 % for slight to very strong 93 confinement , respectively ( Fig . S1A ) . Interestingly , this loss in nuclear volume was inversely 94 proportional to nuclear deformation ùúÄ ùëÅùëß ( Fig . 1H , dotted line ) . In addition , the distance between the 95 cell membrane and the nuclear envelope was significantly reduced with confinement ( Fig . 1D , Fig . 96 S1B ) and accompanied by the re - localization of the contractility machinery ( Phosphorylated Myosin 97 Light Chain ( p - MLC ) staining ) from above the nucleus to the side , indicating a cortex rearrangement 98 ( Fig . S1C ) . These data support and reinforce our previous findings ( 23 ) , that cells survive strong 99 squeezing even for a long - term period of 24 h . We provide evidence here that at 24h cells regulate 100 their nuclear volume depending on the level of confinement . 101 102 6 Figure 1 : Cancer cells adapt to prolonged confinement by decreasing their nuclear volume 103 104 ( A ) 3D representation of our confinement device showing the molded agarose pad .

Ordinary one - way ANOVA was carried 117 out between each confinement condition at 2 h and was not significant . 118 Nuclear volume adaptation to long - term confinement occurs during mitosis 119 We then wondered which phase of the cell cycle contributed to this adaptation . It was reported that 120 mechanically confined cells , unable to adopt a rounded shape prior to division , displayed a stressed 121 cell division with delayed mitosis , multi - daughter mitosis events , unevenly sized daughter cells , and 122 induction of cell death ( 11 , 12 ) . Similarly , in our system , we observed a gradual increase in 123 abnormal divisions and mitosis duration with the level of confinement ( Fig . S2A - B , Movie S1 ) . We 124 further tested if the nuclear volume was conserved throughout mitosis , i . e . , if the volume of the sum 125 of the two daughter cells after division was equal to the volume of their mother cell . We focused 126 our analysis on normal division , and only cells capable of progressing through their next cell cycle 127 to mitosis were considered . Intriguingly , nuclei were smaller after the first division under 128 confinement ( Fig . 2A ) , with a volume ratio decreasing gradually with increasing nuclear 129 deformation , similar to the one observed at 24 h on fixed samples ( Fig . 1H , 2A , and Fig . S2C for 130 the fit ) . The loss of volume during mitosis reached up to 60 ¬± 15 % for the strongest confinement 131 ( Fig . 2A ) . The fact that we obtained the same proportionality on fixed ( Fig . 1H ) and live ( Fig . 2A ; 132 Fig . S2C ) samples confirmed the robustness of our results . Conversely , during the second division 133 under confinement , we observed no loss of nuclear volume ( Fig . 2B ) . Hence , the nuclear volume 134 8 seemed to reach homeostasis after the first confined division and did not shrink further during a 135 second confined division . Therefore , mitosis appears to be the main checkpoint in the observed 136 long - term adaptation of nuclear volume . 137 Confined mitosis sets a new nuclear state of homeostasis 138 Next , we investigated whether cell cycle progression was also modified . To this end , we conducted 139 time - lapse experiments over 3 to 4 days on live cells , by confining HT - 29 expressing the FUCCI 140 fluorescent cell cycle reporter system ( Fig . 2C ) . We initially observed that the nuclear volume at 141 G2 entry was similar for slightly and very strongly confined cells , suggesting that the G1 phase was 142 not or weakly affected in HT - 29 cells ( Fig . S2D ) . Then , the time spent in G2 before the first division 143 increased only for cells under very strong confinement ( Fig . 2D ) and led to an increase in relative 144 nuclear growth with a constant growth rate during the G2 phase ( Fig . 2E and Fig . S2E - F ) . This 145 increase in size and growth might be due to an increase in nuclear import following a rise in nuclear 146 envelope tension and uncoupled nuclear and cytoplasmic volumes as proposed by Pennacchio et 147 al . ( 24 ‚Äì 26 ) . Conversely , slighter levels of confinement did not impact cell cycle progression ( Fig . 148 S2E - F ) , in accordance with the tension threshold described by Lomakin et al . and Venturini et al . 149 ( 17 , 18 ) . 150 We then focused on the cell cycle taking place after the first confined division . Surprisingly , for 151 daughter cells , we found that confinement did not significantly change the duration of the whole cell 152 cycle ( Fig . S2I ) and neither that of its subpart ( G1 , S - G2 , Fig . 2F ) . Similarly , relative nuclear growth 153 remained unchanged under confinement during the entire cell cycle ( Fig . S2J ) , and during its 154 subpart ( G1 , S - G2 , Fig . 2G ) , leading to similar nuclear growth rates regardless of the level of 155 confinement ( Fig . S2K ) , with no significant difference in their subparts ( Fig . S2H ) . These results 156 clearly show that after the first confined division , neither cell cycle progression nor growth rate were 157 affected by confinement , cells thus adapted to confinement during the first confined mitosis and 158 reached a new homeostatic state . 159 9 Figure 2 : Nuclear volume adaptation occurs during mitosis setting a new state of homeostasis 160 161 ( A - B ) Quantification of the size of daughter nuclei over their respective mother , under several levels 162 of confinement during the first confined mitosis ( A ) and the second confined mitosis ( B ) and 163 representative images of nuclei at the end of the G2 phase ( just before mitosis ) and its respective 164 daughter nuclei just after mitosis ( beginning of G1 phase ) , for control and strong confinement 165 10 conditions during the first confined mitosis ( A ) and the second confined mitosis ( B ) , scale bar = 10 166 ¬µm .

Nuclear protrusions are dynamic 179 structures whose membrane can rupture ‚Äì that can be visualized by leakage of NLS - RFP dye to 180 the cytoplasm ( Fig . S3A , arrows ) ‚Äì and repair ( 20 ) . To investigate whether nuclear tension can be 181 regulated under prolonged confinement , we first quantified the nuclear envelope folding from lamin 182 A / C immunostaining ( Fig 3A ) by defining the positive area as the excess area of the lamina 183 envelope compared to the nuclear area ( see methods and Fig . S3B ) . In control conditions , the 184 nuclear envelope was folded , reaching similar levels at 2 h and 24 h ( 56 ¬± 1 . 5 % and 57 ¬± 2 % 185 respectively , Fig . 3B ) . Under strong confinement ( 60 % nuclear deformation ) , a complete unfolding 186 of the nuclear envelope was observed at 2 h ( Fig . 3A ) , evidenced by a radical decrease in the 187 positive area ( Fig . 3B , down to 20 ¬± 1 % ) . At 24 h , a refolding of lamin A / C was observed ( Fig . 3A ) , 188 with an increase in the positive area ( 34 ¬± 1 % , Fig . 3B ) , suggesting that nuclei have adapted to 189 lower their nuclear tension . 190 As a proxy for nuclear envelope tension , we analyzed the evolution of nuclear protrusions . Under 191 the strongest levels of confinement ( 60 % and 70 % nuclear deformation ) , we observed nuclear 192 11 protrusions at 2 h ( Fig . 1E , strong - very strong confinement panel , and Fig . 3C ) . Such protrusions 193 had a limited contribution to the increase in nuclear - projected area , as the increase remained 194 significantly different even if protrusions were dismissed to compute the projected area ( Fig S3C ) . 195 The proportion of nuclei displaying protrusions ( indiscriminately called blebs in the rest of the 196 manuscript for simplicity ) , as well as dividing , apoptotic , and normal nuclei was quantified according 197 to their morphology ( Fig . 3C , insets ) . Under slight confinement ( 41 % nuclear deformation ) , blebbing 198 nuclei represented only 4 . 2 ¬± 4 . 7 % of all nuclei ( Fig . 3D ) . However , the proportion of these nuclei 199 gradually increased with confinement and represented 37 . 7 ¬± 6 . 7 % and 63 . 4 ¬± 11 . 8 % of all nuclei 200 for 60 % and 70 % of nuclear deformation , respectively ( Fig . 3D ) . Strikingly , at 24 h of confinement , 201 those proportions dropped to less than 10 % , and were mirrored by an increase in normal nuclei 202 proportions ( Fig . 3E and Fig S3D ) . The number of blebs per cell and the size of these blebs were 203 also drastically reduced at 24 h under strong confinement ( Fig . S3E - H ) . This change in nuclear 204 phenotype at 24 h is in accordance with the reduction in nuclear volume and the refolding of the 205 nuclear envelope . 206 As nuclear volume adaptation occurs after mitosis , we investigated whether this event could also 207 play a role in the loss of nuclear blebs . Using time - lapse experiments , we quantified nuclear blebs 208 before and after confined divisions . Before mitosis , the mean number of blebs per cell was 1 ¬± 0 . 3 209 for cells under strong confinement ( Fig . 3F , 60 % nuclear deformation ) , and reached 3 ¬± 2 . 2 for 210 very strong confinement ( Fig . S3I , 70 % nuclear deformation ) . Surprisingly , immediately after 211 mitosis , the mean number of blebs per cell was close to 0 for both strong and very strong 212 confinement ( Fig . 3F , Fig S3I , Movie S2 ) . In addition , we observed no blebs before the second 213 mitosis ( Fig . 3F ) . Loss of nuclear blebs is clearly linked to mitosis , suggesting that nuclear volume 214 and nuclear envelope tension are tightly coupled , and supports the hypothesis that mitosis is a key 215 regulator of nuclear envelope tension . 216 12 As the presence of nuclear blebs is also associated with DNA damage , we quantified such 217 damages using Œ≥H2AX immunostaining . At 2 h of confinement , DNA damage appeared , as 218 evidenced by an increase in the number of Œ≥H2AX foci per cell ( marker of double - strand breaks , 219 Fig . 3G ) . This confinement - induced DNA damage was repaired at 24 h , with a number of foci per 220 cell in confined conditions back to basal levels ( Fig . 3H ) . The mechanism ( s ) behind such repair is 221 likely coupled to nuclear adaptation , either during cell division itself or due to the relaxation of the 222 nuclear envelope tension at mitosis . 223 224 13 Figure 3 : Mitosis regulates nuclear tension under prolonged confinement 225 226 ( A ) Representative confocal images ( max intensity projection ) of stained nuclei and lamin A / C 227 without confinement ( control ) or under 60 % nuclear deformation ( strong confinement ) at 2 h and 228 24 h .

Ordinary one - way ANOVA was also performed on all 24 h confinement conditions and was no 243 significant . 244 Cells under confinement regulate their apparent nuclear surface at mitosis 245 To gain further insights into the mechanism at play , we wondered what physical parameter is 246 involved in the nuclear adaptation described above . We hypothesize that the nuclear volume can 247 be set by the total amount of nuclear envelope or by the apparent surface area of the nucleus 248 ( nuclear surface area excluding the membrane ruffles ) . First , we estimated the total surface area 249 of the nuclear envelope ùëÜ 0 from the apparent surface area of confined nuclei at 2h , assuming the 250 total unfolding of the nuclear envelope ( Fig . 4A ) . Taking S 0 as constant , we calculated the volume 251 V 0 a nucleus with a tensed nuclear envelope would have for various nuclear deformation ( Total 252 available surface model , Fig . 4B , pink line ) . Second , we estimated the apparent surface area S app 253 of unconfined nuclei using simple geometric assumptions ( see supplementary text and Fig . 4A ) . 254 Assuming a constant apparent surface area S app , we computed the corresponding nucleus volume 255 V app for various degrees of nuclear deformation ( Apparent surface model in Fig . 4B , green line ) . 256 We found that the volumes calculated using the apparent surface model closely matched the 257 experimental volumes measured after 24 h under confinement ( Fig . 4B , points ) . This validates the 258 second hypothesis and shows that the apparent surface area is a crucial parameter for nuclear 259 volume adaptation . 260 15 To further validate this hypothesis , we also computed the apparent surface area S app from the 261 experimental z - stacked images ( assuming a spherical or cylindrical geometry for the unconfined 262 and confined state , respectively ) . The calculated apparent surface area of confined nuclei ùëÜ ùëéùëùùëù , 263 passively increased after 2 h under confinement ( Fig . 4C , black points ) , while it reached a constant 264 value at 24 h ( Fig . 4C , red points ) , very close to the constant apparent surface area computed for 265 unconfined cells ( Fig . 4C , dotted line ) . Together , these results suggest that the new homeostatic 266 volume reached by cells after mitosis might be set by the apparent surface area of the nuclear 267 envelope and advocates for a role of nuclear tension sensing that would govern such an apparent 268 surface area . 269 Figure 4 : A new state of nuclear homeostasis is determined by the apparent nuclear surface at mitosis 270 exit 271 272 ( A ) Schematic representation of the geometric model , showing the apparent nuclear envelope 273 surface area S app and the unfolded nuclear envelope surface area S 0 ( B ) Calculations of nuclear 274 volume using the apparent surface area ( green ) and the total surface area ( pink ) .

( C ) Nuclear apparent surface area as a function of the 277 initial nuclear deformation ùúÄ ùëÅùëß at 2 h and 24 h under confinement . The dashed line shows the 278 apparent surface measured for unconfined cells . 279 280 16 Nuclear adaptation to confinement requires the tension sensor cPLA2 , but also actomyosin 281 contractility 282 We then further investigate the molecular actors involved in this adaptation . As the key role of 283 cPLA2 in the sensing of nuclear envelope tension has been highlighted in different contexts ( 17 , 284 31 , 32 ) , we tested whether nuclear volume adaptation was preserved upon cPLA2 inhibition ( with 285 AACOCF3 ) . In addition , as cPLA2 is also involved in the regulation of myosin II contractility in a 286 calcium - dependent manner ( 17 , 18 ) , the nuclear volume adaption was also tested upon depletion 287 of intracellular calcium ( with BAPTA - AM and 2APB ) or inhibition of myosin II ( with Blebbistatin ) . 288 Upon inhibition of cPLA2 , myosin II , or upon depletion of intracellular calcium , no further decrease 289 in volume at 24 h was observed ( Fig . 5A ) . 290 From this small pharmacological screen , we therefore concluded that the nuclear adaptation 291 observed during mitosis requires nuclear tension sensing through cPLA2 and activation of 292 actomyosin contractility . The latter is a well - known transducer of stress to the nucleus , inducing 293 deformation and blebbing ( 28 ) . To further confirm that actomyosin contractility was mandatory for 294 nuclear envelop tension relaxation , we quantified the number of blebs in the presence of 295 Blebbistatin . We observed that a large number of blebs were still present after 24 h of confinement 296 ( Fig . 5B - C ) . Similarly , inhibiting contractility before applying the confinement ( Blebbistatin added 1 297 h before confinement ) also prevented the regulation of nuclear volume and blebs ( Fig S4 A - D ) . 298 These results highlight the interplay between contractility , nuclear tension , and nuclear volume 299 regulation in setting nuclear homeostasis upon prolonged confinement . 300 301 17 Figure 5 : The long - term nuclear adaptation is defective with altered actomyosin cortex 302 303 ( A ) Quantification of the nuclear volume changes ( in percentage ) between 2 h and 24 h without 304 confinement and under strong confinement with several drugs .

Using an imposed deformation , 314 we show that the nucleus regulates both its volume and its structure ( blebs , lamin A / C folding ) 315 within 24 h . We evidenced that this regulation is mediated by mitosis . Nuclei then reach a new state 316 of homeostasis to alleviate nuclear tension , with no further adaptation observed in the next 317 generations . This regulation is an active process requiring the tension sensor cPLA2 , intracellular 318 calcium , as well as the contractility machinery . 319 Mitosis plays a key role in nuclear adaptation to confinement and alleviation of nuclear 320 envelope tension 321 The key step in nuclear adaptation to confinement is cell mitosis . We clearly show that the 322 regulation of nuclear volume observed at 24 h of confinement largely originated from volumetric 323 changes at division exit . The duration of confined mitosis can be prolonged due to defects in spindle 324 assembly ( 12 ) or leads to asymmetric or multi - daughter division ( 11 ) , but so far such shrinking of 325 the nucleus during division has never been observed to our knowledge . More strikingly , no further 326 shrinking was observed for the second division under confinement . This important observation 327 suggests a true adaptation to confinement ; once adapted , there is no further volume decrease . 328 Intriguingly , the nuclear volume loss reached for the strongest confinement ( ~ 60 % of original 329 nuclear volume ) is similar to the range of chromatin volume mentioned in ( 35 ) . It will be of interest 330 to investigate in future studies whether the volume loss can be attributed to the nucleoplasm 331 volume , so that the volume reached corresponds to the immobile chromatin fraction only . For now , 332 the mechanisms involved remain elusive . Using a mechanistic approach , we showed that the 333 apparent nuclear surface area is the parameter conserved over a long time and therefore during 334 cell division . By regulating the apparent surface area of their nucleus , cells can adjust their nuclear 335 envelope tension to a homeostatic level . Indeed , mitosis also plays a pivotal role in relaxing the 336 19 nuclear envelope tension generated by confinement as nuclear blebs disappeared completely after 337 the first mitosis , while nuclear envelope folds reappeared in confined conditions at 24 h . 338 The critical role of cPLA2 and actomyosin contractility in the regulation of lamina tension 339 and nuclear volume 340 The nuclear adaptation we evidenced was lost by inhibiting the nuclear envelope tension sensor 341 cPLA2 , or by blocking intracellular calcium or contractility . These results strongly highlight the 342 pivotal role of nuclear tension in nuclear homeostasis . Of note , so far cPLA2 was shown to be 343 activated above a tension threshold ( 17 ) , whereas in our study , we observed a gradual nuclear 344 adaptation , suggesting that other parameters are used as a confinement readout by the cells in 345 mitosis . 346 These results are also in accordance with the fact that abnormal actomyosin contractility is 347 associated with changes in cell division , such as defects in spindle positioning ( 12 , 36 ) , failed 348 mitosis , and the appearance of polynucleated cells ( 11 , 12 ) . During cell division , actomyosin 349 contractility participates in cleavage furrow formation ( 37 ) . A recent study pointed out that myosin - 350 II has indeed a role of mechano - protection , with increase of abnormal mitosis and genetic changes 351 upon myosin - II suppression ( 38 ) . We report here for the first time a role of myosin - II also in 352 mechano - adapatation of nuclear volume and tension : contractility is required to set nuclear volume 353 and nuclear envelope folding , mostly during nuclear envelope reformation at the end of mitosis . 354 Regulation of nuclear repair mechanism is associated with lamina folding and nuclear 355 volume loss 356 Consistent with previous studies ( 39 , 40 ) , we also evidenced an increase in DNA - damage at 2 h of 357 confinement . Such an increase in DNA - damage could lead to chromosomal instability and 358 mutations ( 41 , 42 ) . However , in addition to lamina refolding and nuclear volume loss , we also 359 observed a decrease in DNA damage at 24 h of confinement . This is in accordance with the 360 20 reported role of lamin in the DNA damage repair pathway ( 43 ) and a lower nuclear envelope tension 361 associated with bleb disappearance . Such repair mechanisms have also been reported in other 362 confinement situations ( 21 ) , as well as in response to other stresses like radiotherapy ( 44 ) . As such 363 a repair mechanism is highly correlated with cell - cycle re - entry ( 21 ) , this is again consistent with a 364 key role for mitosis in such DNA - damage regulation in response to nuclear deformation . 365 Outlooks 366 Our results call for an in - depth analysis of the molecular pathways at play , as well as for deciphering 367 the consequences that such regulation could have in the context of cancer and resistance to 368 therapies . The nuclear to cytoplasmic volume ratio , which is constant within a given population , is 369 most likely to be impacted by confinement and changes in nuclear envelope tension ( 24 , 45 , 46 ) , 370 and might be at play in the regulation we describe herein . The import / export regulated by the 371 nuclear pore complex is also a putative important player ( 25 ) , with important implication for 372 mecanosensitive transcription factors such as the Yes - associated protein ( YAP ) ( 47 , 48 ) or MKL1 373 ( 49 ) . Lastly , we identified a clear change in lamin unfolding / refolding during this nuclear adaptation . 374 The interplay between lamin A / C level and matrix stiffness has been clearly established ( 50 , 51 ) , 375 and is coupled to cell‚Äôs spreading and hence nuclear tension ( imposed by the stress fibers on the 376 nucleus ) . To better understand the underlying mechanism involved in the refolding of the lamin A / C 377 after mitosis highlighted in this study , it would be of interest in the future to investigate how the 378 amount of phosphorylated lamins and overall level of lamin A / C is changing in mitotic cells 379 submitted to such uniaxial deformation . In addition , lamins and lamin - associated proteins are 380 known regulators of nuclear size ( 46 ) and should therefore be further investigated , especially in the 381 context of cancer . Indeed , abnormal nuclei shape ( 52 ) , together with alterations in the expression 382 of lamin A and lamin B is a hallmark for the prognosis of many tumors ( 33 ) , including colorectal 383 cancer ( 53 ) . Low lamin A / C is associated with a decrease in stiffness , irregular shape , and larger 384 21 nuclei deformation ( 54 ) as well as increased metastatic capacities ( 55 ) . Of note , the HT - 29 cell line 385 used in this study presents the p53 mutation ( 56 ) , has no lamin B2 , and low lamin B1 level ( 57 ) . 386 Loss of lamin B1 leads to nuclear blebs , while it has been reported that nuclear envelope rupture 387 is dependent on p53 ( 58 ) . The role of lamins and p53 mutations could be addressed by analyzing 388 the nuclear adaptation in other cancer cell lines of different origins , different grades , and more 389 specifically with or without p53 and different levels of lamins expression . The regulation of nuclear 390 size identified in this study could have important consequences on resistance to classical 391 chemotherapeutic treatments that target proliferation . Overall , our findings could pave the way for 392 novel therapeutic strategies against tumor cells . 393 Materials and Methods 394 Cell culture 395 HT - 29 wild type colorectal adenocarcinoma cells were purchased from the ATCC ( HT29 HTB - 38 ) . 396 A stable cell line expressing NLS - mKate2 was established using the lentiviral vector IncuCyte¬Æ 397 nuclight orange ( Œª ex = 588 nm , Œª em = 633 nm ) : the cells were selected using puromycin according to 398 the manufacturer‚Äôs protocol . The stable HT29 expressing Fucci ( Cdt1 - RFP and hGeminin - GFP ) 399 cell line was a gift from Dr . Toufic Renno‚Äôs team ( C . Chaveroux team , CRCL , Lyon , France ) . 400 All cells were cultured in Dulbecco‚Äôs modified Eagle‚Äôs medium ( DMEM - Glutamax , Gibco TM ) 401 supplemented with 10 % heat - inactivated fetal bovine serum ( FBS ; PanBiotech‚Ñ¢ ) , 100 units / 100¬µg 402 penicillin / streptomycin ( Gibco TM ) . Routinely , all HT - 29 cell lines were grown in T - 25 cell culture 403 flasks and kept at 37¬∞C and under 5 % CO 2 . Culture medium was changed regularly , and cell 404 passage was carried out at 70 % confluency . Cell lines were tested for Mycoplasma every 6 months 405 and the tests were negative . 406 22 Drug treatments 407 The following pharmacological inhibitors and chemical compounds were used : Blebbistatin ( Myosin 408 II inhibitor Tocris‚Ñ¢ ) at a final concentration of 100 ¬µM ; BAPTA - AM ( abcam ab120503n ) and 2 APB 409 ( intracellular calcium depletion , abcam ab120124 ) , both at a final concentration of 10 ¬µM ; and 410 AACOCF3 ( cPLA2 inhibitor , abcam ab120916 ) at a final concentration of 20 ¬µM . 411 To inhibit cPLA2 or intracellular calcium , agarose molds were incubated overnight with a medium 412 with 20 ¬µM AACOCF3 or with 10 ¬µM BAPTA - AM and 10 ¬µM 2 APB , respectively . Immediately after 413 confinement , the medium was replaced by 500 ¬µL of medium with the corresponding drug ( s ) . 414 To inhibit cell contractility before confinement , we added 500¬µL of medium with 100 ¬µM Blebbistatin 415 1 h prior to confinement . 416 To inhibit the cell contractility after confinement , 500 ¬µL of medium solution with 200 ¬µM of 417 Blebbistatin was added following confinement ( to reach a final concentration within the confiner of 418 100 ¬µM ) . Initial rinsing after confinement was also made with a medium containing Blebbistatin at 419 100 ¬µM . 420 Multi - height micro - milled mold fabrication 421 The height of the micropillars ( from 9 ¬µm to 3 ¬µm ) determines the level of spatial confinement of 422 cells . The array presents regularly distributed pillars ( distance between each pillar of 800 ¬µm ) with 423 specific shapes according to their height : the ‚Äúo‚Äù shape for 9 ¬µm ; the ‚Äú - ‚Äù shape for 7¬µm ; the ‚ÄúL‚Äù 424 shape for 5 ¬µm ; the ‚Äú + ‚Äù shape for 3¬µm . The field of pillars is surrounded by a solid band of 3 . 5 mm 425 to stabilize the structure , and two external notches to enable the proper positioning during molding . 426 The pillars were drawn using Autodesk software and the mold was created using the CNC Mini - 427 Mill / GX on brass . 428 23 Agarose molding 429 Based on the procedure described in Prunet et al . ( 23 ) , molding was adapted to obtain accurate 430 agarose replicates from the newly developed multi - height brass mold . We obtained a user - friendly , 431 robust , and time - saving system to visualize and analyze the long - term effect of four levels of cell 432 confinement on cancer cell morphology and biology . 433 First , a solution of agarose diluted in distilled water ( 2 % ( w / v ) ) was prepared by autoclaving at 434 120¬∞C for 10 min , or 30 s microwave ( 1000 W ) . Of note a 2 % agarose pad corresponds to a stiffness 435 of 150 kPa ( 23 ) ; in this stiffness range , cells cannot deform the confining agarose gel . All the 436 following steps were performed under a sterile culture hood , and the polycarbonate ( PC ) holder 437 was UV sterilized before use ( 20 min on each side under 24 W , 365 nm ) . 400 ¬µL of the prepared 438 agarose solution was deposited in the prewarmed PC holder ( placed on a hot plate at 75¬∞C ) and 439 was left at room temperature for 5 min to let the gel set . Then , 500 ¬µL of the prepared agarose 440 solution was deposited on the prewarmed micro - milled brass mold ( on the same hot plate 441 temperature ) with the PC holder and placed under the press ( Fig . S5 ) . The press generates a 442 uniform pressure and ensures the contact between the PC holder and the mold , to ensure proper 443 molding and resolute pillars . After 30 min under press at room temperature , the PC holder was 444 gently removed from the brass mold . Evenly distributed holes were drilled into the gel using a 20G 445 and 16G puncher and through holes present on the PC holder . In total , five 16G holes and four 446 20G holes were done . The molded agarose gel was then placed in sterile PBS and sterilized under 447 UV light ( 20 min on each side ) . The molded agarose can be stored in its PC holder at 4¬∞C in PBS 448 until further use . It was replaced either by culture medium or by drug treatment and incubated at 449 37¬∞C at least 12 h before the confinement experiment . 450 24 Microfabrication - based confinement of cell populations 451 Cell confinement was performed using the agarose - based soft cell confiner methods previously 452 described ( 23 ) and is now available as Agarsqueezer ( https : / / www . idylle - labs . com / agarsqueezer - 453 by - softconfiner ) . Briefly , after mounting and autoclaving of the confiner holder with a clean glass 454 coverslip , coverslips were coated with fibronectin 50 ¬µg / mL ( Sigma - Aldrich‚Ñ¢ ) ( 1 h incubation in 455 the system at room temperature and washed 3 times with PBS ) . Cells were then seeded in the 456 systems overnight . An intermediate cell density level was chosen for all experiments ( 500 ¬µL of a 457 cell solution at 180 , 000 cells / mL , corresponding to ~ 45 , 000 cells / cm¬≤ , similar to the range used for 458 cell culture ) . After cell adhesion , the seeded cells were gently washed three times to replace the 459 medium with pre - warmed fresh culture medium ( 500 ŒºL ) . The PC holder containing the molded 460 agarose gel was then placed in the system on top of the cells , and a clamping washer was tightened 461 with a specific clamping tool . The molded gel was then tightly in contact with the glass coverslip 462 supporting the cells . A reservoir of 500 ŒºL of culture medium was added above the plastic holder 463 and the molded agarose was then washed three times ( 5 min each ) with pre - warmed culture 464 medium to get rid of any paracrine factors secreted by the dead cell population situated under the 465 pillars . 466 Immunostaining 467 During confinement , cells were fixed in situ with paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) : the cell culture medium 468 was removed , and cells were washed twice with PBS . 4 % PFA ( Electron Microscopy Sciences‚Ñ¢ ) 469 was added and incubated for 40 min at RT . After incubation , samples were rinsed with PBS - 3 % 470 BSA ( Sigma - Aldrich‚Ñ¢ ) ( 3 x 20 min ) . The agarose gel was then removed and cells were 471 permeabilized using 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 ( Acros Organics‚Ñ¢ ) for 10 min at RT . After blocking with 472 PBS - 3 % BSA ( 3x5min ) to inhibit non - specific binding of antibodies , cells were incubated overnight 473 at 4¬∞C with primary antibodies diluted in PBS - 2 % BSA - 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 . After 3 x 5 min washes 474 with PBS , samples were incubated with secondary antibodies for 2 h at RT . The primary antibodies 475 25 used were : p - MLC ( Cell signaling‚Ñ¢ at 1 / 50 ) ; LaminA / C ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology‚Ñ¢ at 1 / 100 ) , 476 Œ≥H2Ax ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology‚Ñ¢ at 1 / 200 ) . NucGreen‚Ñ¢ Dead 488 ( Invitrogen‚Ñ¢ , 1 drop per 3 477 ml in PBS ) ; Alexa 647 Phalloidin ( Invitrogen‚Ñ¢ at 1 / 500 ) ; Alexa 555 Phalloidin ( Invitrogen‚Ñ¢ at 478 1 / 500 ) were also used . The secondary antibodies used were : Anti - Mouse 647 ( Invitrogen‚Ñ¢ at 479 1 / 500 ) ; anti - rabbit 647 ( Invitrogen‚Ñ¢ at 1 / 500 ) , anti - mouse 555 ( Invitrogen‚Ñ¢ at 1 / 500 ) . Coverslips 480 were then mounted using 2 drops of Fluoroshield‚Ñ¢ ( Sigma - Aldrich‚Ñ¢ ) and varnish - sealed after 481 overnight hardening at room temperature . 482 Confocal fluorescence microscopy 483 Fixed samples were visualized using a Leica SP5 confocal microscope with a 20x Dry objective 484 ( NA = 0 . 7 ) , a 40x oil immersion ( NA = 1 . 25 ) , a 40x Dry ( NA = 0 . 95 ) , or a 63x oil immersion ( NA = 485 1 . 25 ) objectives . Images were collected in sequential mode using averaging at a resolution of 486 1024x1024 . Z - stacks of cells were acquired to precisely measure the height of confinement and 487 nuclear volumes ( dz = 0 . 2 ¬µm or 0 . 5 ¬µm for each stack ) . 488 Epifluorescence imaging 489 Fixed samples were also visualized using an inverted microscope Leica DMI8 using 490 epifluorescence microscopy with a 40x dry objective ( NA = 0 . 55 ) . 491 Live - cell imaging 492 Cells were observed with an inverted microscope Leica DMI8 using epifluorescence imaging . 493 Timelapse imaging was performed for 2 to 5 days in a controlled environment ( CO 2 , temperature , 494 and humidity ) , using a 20x dry objective ( NA = 0 . 7 ) . A motorized x - y stage enabled the concomitant 495 recording of up to 20 regions for each system every 10 min . 496 Quantitative image analysis 497 Cell height , nuclear area , and volume were assessed with a homemade routine workflow using 498 both ImageJ / Fiji and MATLAB¬Æ software . First , after applying a gaussian blur on nuclei - stained 499 26 images , nuclei were automatically detected either using the stardist Fiji plugin ( 59 ) or using the 500 Otsu‚Äôs threshold detection directly in Matlab¬Æ . Mask and labeled images obtained were exported 501 in Matlab¬Æ to perform automated morphological analyses on individual pre - labeled nuclei . 502 Orthogonal views of both nuclei and phalloidin staining were used to obtain nuclear ( ‚Ñé ùëõùë¢ùëê ) and cell 503 heights ( ‚Ñé ùëêùëíùëôùëô ) , respectively . To do so , we took the full width half maxima of the z - plot profile of 504 ImageJ / Fiji of each orthogonal view . 505 For the control conditions , the nuclear height is determined using the same method . For the volume 506 however , it was necessary to estimate the volume for the reconstituted volume generated from 507 confocal z - stack , by combining 2DStarDist plugin with a home - made python routine . 508 For the nuclear area , at least four different areas were imaged and analyzed per condition . 509 Proportion analysis of nuclear blebs both in live and fixed experiments was conducted using the 510 cell counter plugin of ImageJ / Fiji . To further characterize the nuclear blebbing phenotype , labeled 511 images of nuclei and their blebs were obtained using the stardist Fiji plugin ( 59 ) ( blebs are 512 automatically extracted from the main nuclei using stardist ) We filtered the core nucleus and their 513 blebs based on their respective area . If the area of an object was below 100 ¬µm¬≤ for confined 514 conditions , it was considered to be a bleb . 515 DNA damage analysis was automatically performed using the Find Maxima tool within each 516 nucleus in ImageJ / Fiji . 517 Folding of the nuclear envelope . The percentage of positive nuclear envelope area was used 518 as a semi - quantitative parameter as a proxy for the folding of the nuclear envelope ( 17 , 60 ) . It 519 corresponds to the excess area of the lamina envelope compared to the nuclear area ( Fig . S3B ) . 520 The nuclear envelope - positive area was assessed by thresholding the maximum intensity 521 projection images of lamin A / C staining obtained by confocal microscopy ( 63x objective NA 1 . 25 , 522 27 Leica SP5 ) and merging them with nuclei masks . This allowed us to study the laminas within the 523 nucleus and provided information on the proportion of area with laminas within the nucleus ( positive 524 area ) . 525 Live movies were analyzed manually by using either MTrackJ , or manual tracking and ROI 526 manager tool in ImageJ / Fiji plugin . Volume was calculated using the area of each cell multiplied by 527 the theoretical confinement height measured previously for each confinement zone ( Figure 1D ) . 528 Thus , we could measure nuclear areas over time in each phase of the cell cycle and the 529 corresponding duration of those phases . 530 For the analysis of volume changes during mitosis , only normal mitosis were considered . Therefore , 531 only cells that were able to progress in their next cell cycle up to another mitosis were taken into 532 account . 533 For each experiment , at least three different areas within each confined zone of the confiner were 534 analyzed . 535 Statistical Analysis 536 Statistical data were expressed as mean ¬± standard deviation unless mentioned otherwise . Sample 537 size ( n ) and the number of repetitions ( N ) are specified in the text of the paper or figure legends . 538 The statistical significance between experimental conditions was determined using a two - tailed 539 unpaired t - test , Welch‚Äôs test , Mann - Whitney test , or ANOVA after confirming that the data met 540 appropriate assumptions ( normality distribution , homogeneous variance , and independent 541 sampling ) . All data were analyzed with GraphPad Prism 8 . 0 . ( San Diego , CA , USA ) . * * * * P < 542 0 . 0001 , * * * P < 0 . 001 , * * P < 0 . 01 , * P < 0 . 05 . 543 28 Data Availability 544 Data will be shared using Zotero platforms ( raw data extracted from image analysis , a set of typical 545 images , as well as matlab code used for image analysis ) [ dataset ] . 546 Acknowledgments 547 This work was supported by the Institut Convergence Plascan : ANR - 17 - CONV - 0002 , the Institut 548 Universitaire de France ( IUF ) and the ARC for part of M .
