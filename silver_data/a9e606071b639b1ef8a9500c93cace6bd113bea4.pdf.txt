ABSTRACT Immersion with a foreign language is key to increased motivation , satisfaction , and learning success . However , this can be hindered by anxiety and lack of access to immersive settings . LingoLand will address this by immersing people in foreign language learning environments designed to mimic real scenarios . Using generative machine learning , LingoLand presents players with personalized missions where they can freely interact with game characters , all endlessly patient and supportive of new language learners . Players receive instant feedback through a natural , voice - based interaction . Through LingoLand , players gain an understanding of diferent cultures while building practical language skills in a fun way .

Immersive environments for foreign language learning allow learners to actively engage in communication and problem - solving tasks [ 8 ] . Such interactions , whether in - person or computer - mediated , have consistently been found to have enhanced pedagog - ical benefts [ 16 , 17 ] . However , opportunities for immersion ( e . g . , encounters with a native speaker or travel to a foreign country ) are not easily accessible . Even when present , people do not truly immerse themselves due to communication apprehension and fear of social evaluation [ 14 ] . This anxiety lowers motivation and self - confdence , further hindering successful language acquisition [ 4 ] . Game environments may hold keys to re - creating immersive sce - narios sans such barriers to motivation and engagement [ 19 ] . An AI - assisted immersive web - based game , LingoLand reduces physical and psychological impedances to immersion by allow - ing learners to interact with generative agents and game assets optimized for foreign language learning in context . Additionally , individualized instruction and learning paths have been shown to improve language learning gains [ 6 ] . LingoLand presents custom game - play to each learner , enabling such benefcial learning paradigms at scale . UIST ’23 Adjunct , October 29 - November 01 , 2023 , San Francisco , CA , USA Olivia Seow 2 GAME DESIGN Genuine immersion requires a dynamic and adaptive environment . Games like Noun Town and L2 Speak approximate immersion in hard - coded game environments [ 2 , 3 ] . Recently , Park et al . demon - strated that large language models can be used to create immersive virtual environments that simulate interpersonal communication , albeit without a frst - person perspective engagement [ 15 ] . Genera - tive models can also generate custom imagery that boosts memory retention [ 13 ] . Building on recent work , LingoLand will employ foundation models to derive endlessly engaging game scenarios and personalized learning paths in a simulated game environment . Distinctively , LingoLand introduces a frst - person perspective to improve immersion in language learning . To advance in LingoLand , players complete custom missions involving interacting with in - game objects and characters in a foreign language ( see Figure 1 ) . The missions can also be tied to real - world contexts across learning levels ; they can range from buying a strawberry at a market , to discussing a prominent Human - Computer Interaction paper at a conference venue . New dialogue and assets can be generated when a new scenario requires it . Speech - to - text technology will allow players to practice con - versationally . Broken language inputs ( e . g . , mixtures of languages , incorrect pronunciation ) can be understood by all in - game charac - ters , who consistently provide nurturing guidance and correction , fostering an encouraging learning atmosphere . 3 TECHNOLOGY LingoLand will use Anthropic’s Claude 2 to formulate sensible and contextually appropriate missions and conversational responses that support and stimulate the language learning journey . When the game begins , the user’s interests and language ability will be evaluated and integrated into a Claude 2 prompt to produce suitable missions . In - game characters will each be crafted to be supportive of the player’s learning journey , while having a rich backstory that makes the game more dynamic and gratifying . Interaction between in - game characters enables natural game - play but does not need to happen frequently , helping to minimize API calls . A journal struc - ture and event log will efciently store memories in a vector data - base [ 1 , 15 ] . OpenAI’s Whisper , an automatic speech recognition system , will process multi - lingual voice inputs . Since Claude 2 is cross - lingual , mixed language input can be directly parsed . For generating audio outputs , we intend to use MDN’s Web Speech , potentially employing other generated environmental sounds or natural voice generators for a more authentic feel . Creating interactive visual elements is crucial for engaging game - play and memory retention . Hence , we plan to use a difusion model with low - rank adaptation [ 10 ] to craft game assets , resembling those conceptualized in Figure 1 . Players can also create custom fashcards using a doodle - based ControlNet [ 20 ] . This aids memory recall and helps track players’ progress across individual learning styles and preferences . The front - end will use React . js and TypeScript for creating an interactive user interface that is broadly accessible to many users via a web browser . Collectively , these modern tools enable us to make LingoLand an engaging , efective , and enjoyable language learning experience . 4 DEVELOPMENT PROCESS To improve design outcomes , LingoLand will undergo iterative development through a parallel prototyping process [ 7 ] . This ap - proach will be complemented by the adoption of human - centered design practices , including in - depth needs investigation and regu - lar user feedback sessions [ 12 ] . We will also refer to proposed best practices on human - AI interaction for further guidance [ 5 ] . From the early stages of development and as abiding by Insti - tutional Review Board protocols , language learners from diverse backgrounds will be invited to test the game’s design and func - tionality . Their input will guide the refning of game mechanisms , missions , personalized learning capabilities , and an appropriate framework to measure LingoLand’s success . We will also consult with human game designers to better understand the role and im - pact of AI - assisted game design . We expect that LingoLand will evolve as we receive user insights that provide a deeper understanding of how diferent people engage with the game . The development process will allow us to create a tool sensitive to diverse needs , as elaborated in Section 5 . Through - out development and deployment , we will continuously collect and integrate user feedback to improve and refne LingoLand . 5 ETHICS AND BROADER IMPACT LingoLand aims to ofer an experiment in achieving enhanced lan - guage learning through massive customization via human - AI col - laboration . It is not a proposal to eliminate designers , teachers , or human interactions altogether . LingoLand will not attempt to cover all aspects of language learning . We hypothesize that platforms like LingoLand are even more efective when used with actual human instruction and interaction . While large language models have been shown to excel at many multi - lingual tasks [ 18 ] , this does not apply equally well across all use cases [ 21 ] . Moreover , we also acknowledge that it would be nearly impossible to recreate the richness of reality and nuances of diverse cultures in a game environment . We will remain vigilant to ensure the game is sensitive to various cultures and emphasizes inclusivity across a broad range of users . As Kukulska - Hulme et al . describe , it is crucial for AI - assisted language learning tools to accept a diverse range of voice inputs and to avoid prejudicial or false generations [ 11 ] . While LingoLand is proposed in the spirit of play , we strive to foster a respectful environment for diverse players . We will take steps to mitigate un - natural , discriminatory , disrespectful , insensitive , and inappropriate interactions . 6 CONCLUSION AND NEXT STEPS LingoLand promises new avenues of research towards efective and engaging language learning methodologies . If successful , we envision extending LingoLand from a web - based game to one in virtual reality , a modality of immersion that has been shown to increase “attention , motivation , and enjoyment” in foreign language learning [ 9 ] . We aim to contribute to the development of a truly immersive language learning tool .
