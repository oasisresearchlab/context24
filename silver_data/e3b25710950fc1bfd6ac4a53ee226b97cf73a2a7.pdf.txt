GN ] 1 6 D ec 2023 1 Introduction This paper aims to study the extent to which the exploratory nature of scholars and the cognitive diversity of scientific teams shape their ability to generate innovative ideas and obtain scientific recognition . We propose a new author - level metric based on the semantic representation of past publications . It allows us to proxy both intra - individual and inter - individual cognitive diversities and their impacts on creativity in science . A broadly accepted definition of creativity assumes a bipartite composition involving a com - bination of novelty and effectiveness [ Runco and Jaeger , 2012 ] . Novelty , also called originality or invention , lies at the cornerstone of innovative research , bridging existing knowledge and unex - plored scientific territories . Novelty serves as the foundation for peer recognition and functions as a “reward system” wherein the individual credited with the initial discovery garners recognition [ Merton , 1957 , Stephan , 1996 , Carayol et al . , 2019 ] . Effectiveness , on the other hand , refers to the recognition attributed to this novelty . Novel research is frequently referred to as ”High - Risk High - Reward” ( HRHR ) to reflect its high volatility of outcomes . Highly novel research receives more citations on average , but the uncertainty is also more considerable [ Wang et al . , 2017 ] . Due to its risky nature , funding opportunities are limited for innovative research [ OECD , 2021 , Franzoni et al . , 2022 ] . The scientific system favours individuals who can ensure outcomes over those with potentially groundbreaking ideas that might disrupt the field [ Alberts et al . , 2014 ] . It has also been shown that a bias against novelty exists when scholars evaluate a peer’s work [ Wang et al . , 2017 , Ayoubi et al . , 2021 ] and this effect is accentuated by the intellectual distance with the examiner [ Boudreau et al . , 2016 ] . Yet , these novelty indicators are still relatively recent and understudied as it is mostly intended to explain success or bias against novelty . As a result , it is essential to explore and validate new methods to better understand factors that promote novelty and its recognition . Not all idea combinations are worth exploring , hence the challenge of distinguishing between novel and impactful ones . March [ 1991 ] supports the idea that a mix of exploitation and exploration is the key to an organization’s survival . Transposed to science , exploration involves actively pursuing the expansion of one’s understanding and curiosity across various areas of knowledge . Exploitation , on the other hand , refers to an individual specializing in a specific field and continuously building upon their expertise in that area . Put differently , producing a valuable invention would require a proper mix of typical and atypical combinations of knowledge , as seen in Uzzi et al . [ 2013 ] . This dichotomy has been studied in different domains , as mentioned in Foster et al . [ 2015 ] ( e . g . , ”conformity” versus ”dissent” in the philosophy of science ) , and can also be applied to research . The presence of individuals with exploratory profiles appears to facilitate communication among team members who are cognitively distant and then foster creativity Page [ 2008 ] . Indeed , people from outside a domain may have some advantage to offer fresh ideas through their distinct knowledge [ Jeppesen and Lakhani , 2010 , Kuhn , 1962 ] . As the body of knowledge in science expands , researchers increasingly specialize their competen - cies [ Jones et al . , 2008 , Jones , 2009 ] and thus are more able to recombine information locally in the knowledge space , facing incentives to collaborate [ Fleming , 2001 , Boudreau et al . , 2016 ] . Science is seen as a social phenomenon [ Fleck , 2012 ] . Thus , agents that recombine knowledge are individuals embedded in a social context , and cognitive and social phenomena strongly influence the invention process [ Fleming , 2001 ] . Team size has been shown to impact creativity [ Paulus and Nijstad , 2003 , 2 Shin and Zhou , 2007 , Wuchty et al . , 2007 , Falk - Krzesinski et al . , 2011 , Erren et al . , 2017 , Mueller , 2019 ] and the cognitive dimension ( i . e . differences in thinking , problem - solving approaches , and perspectives among individuals ) plays a crucial role in enabling exchange of information and cre - ation of new knowledge [ Nooteboom , 2000 , Nooteboom et al . , 2007 ] . Cognitive diversity is shaped by individuals’ characteristics and the trade - off between exploration and exploitation of the knowl - edge space during their careers . The cognitive distance among team members displays an inverted U - shaped correlation with both learning and innovation [ Nooteboom et al . , 2007 , Ayoubi et al . , 2017 ] , as people being too distant will face difficulty in communicating , and those being cognitively too similar can not benefit from distinct perspectives in the knowledge creation process . Based on the concept of exploration and exploitation , we propose an indicator that serves as a proxy for exploratory vs . exploitative trade - off at both the individual and team levels through past publications . In a nutshell , our indicator measures the cognitive distance between team members as well as the individual propensity to work on various subjects . This approach allows us to assess the impact of cognitive dimensions on individual and collective levels , acting as either a facilitator or a hindrance to creativity . We do not consider our indicator as a replacement for current novelty indicators but rather as a tool that could enhance our understanding of the mechanisms behind novelty and scientific impact . In fact , by incorporating the cognitive dimension into novelty studies , we can develop a more comprehensive understanding of the complex relationship between cognitive aspects , interdisciplinary efforts , and the nature of scientific innovation . Furthermore , examining these questions enables us to provide valuable insights and guidance for researchers and institu - tions striving to enhance scientific progress while avoiding potentially misleading interpretations of research performance measurement . Using PubMed Knowledge Graph ( PKG ) , we empirically investigate the role of these cognitive diversities in the production of novel research outcomes and the ability to obtain scientific recog - nition . We performed the analysis on novelty on five combinatorial novelty indicators [ Uzzi et al . , 2013 , Lee et al . , 2015 , Foster et al . , 2015 , Wang et al . , 2017 , Shibayama et al . , 2021 ] , both on references and MeSH terms , as well as on perceived novelty , using labels submitted by researchers to qualify the contribution of an article ( Faculty Opinion ) 1 . For scientific recognition , we rely on the traditional number of citations and six indicators of disruption and consolidation [ Wu et al . , 2019 , Bu et al . , 2019 , Bornmann et al . , 2019a ] . Our findings emphasize the crucial role of cognitive dimensions in creativity , significantly im - pacting originality and success . We show that cognitive diversity always seems beneficial to combine more distant knowledge . In contrast , the within - team average exploratory profile follows an inverse U - shaped relation with combinatorial novelty ( i . e . there is a turning point where it is no longer beneficial ) . The same relation can be found with citation counts , but we show that the cognitive dimension also strongly influences the nature of citations . Teams with more exploitative profiles consolidate science , while those with high exploratory profiles disrupt it only if they are associ - ated with exploitative researchers . The union of those two types of individuals leads to the most disruptive and distant knowledge combinations . To maximize the relevance of these combinations , maintaining a limited number of highly exploratory individuals is essential , as highly specialized individuals must question and debate their novel perspectives . These specialized individuals are 1 More information can be found here : https : / / facultyopinions . com / 3 the most qualified to extract the full potential of novel ideas and integrate them within the existing scientific paradigm . This results can be linked to Witt [ 2009 ] ’s hypothesis 1 , which states that the creation of new concepts involves two operations , one generative and one interpretative . The gen - erative operation is carried out by the exploratory individuals , new ideas are then integrated into the existing scientific paradigm through a process of interpretation carried out by the exploitative individuals . The collaborative dynamic between exploratory and exploitative individuals facilitates both the generation of new concepts and their effective integration into existing theories . The remainder of the paper is organized as follows . Section II features the background and literature review . Section III details the creation of our metrics and the methodology for addressing our research questions . Section IV presents the results of our analysis , and Section V concludes . 2 Background and literature review This section highlights the team’s relevance in fostering creativity in science and emphasises how team size can influence this process . We also underscore the importance of identifying the social dimensions of the team , a crucial factor in generating new knowledge . Finally , we propose a new approach based on the semantic representation of authors’ past publications that allows studying the role of the cognitive dimension in a team’s ability to produce new and impactful knowledge . 2 . 1 Team science as an engine of creativity Over the past two decades , there has been a significant increase in interest surrounding the Science of Team Science ( SciTS ) [ Falk - Krzesinski et al . , 2011 ] 2 . Since the 1950s , the average number of authors per paper has risen across all scientific disciplines [ Wuchty et al . , 2007 ] . Research collaborations have also become more diverse , inter - institutional collaborations in science and engineering and social science grew by 32 . 8 % and 34 . 4 % , respectively , between 1975 an , d 2005 [ Jones et al . , 2008 ] . In addition , international collaboration has also expanded , with one in five research projects now involving multiple countries [ Xie and Killewald , 2012 ] . Teamwork has proven to be a practical approach to producing impactful scientific results . Ar - ticles written by teams tend to have a higher impact , receiving more citations on average and are more likely to become influential than articles authored solely [ Wuchty et al . , 2007 , Whitfield , 2008 ] . Researchers benefit from collaboration in various ways . Collaborative efforts can enhance rigour through co - authors’ verification [ Leahey , 2016 ] and facilitate the dissemination of their work be - yond their immediate networks [ Leahey , 2016 ] ; this effect is further amplified when collaborations are international or inter - institutional [ Adams , 2013 , Jones et al . , 2008 ] . Additionally , teams have better access to resources , as projects executed by groups are more likely to apply for funding and succeed in obtaining it [ Rawlings and McFarland , 2011 ] . Teams are more likely to produce novel articles than solo - authored publications [ Carayol et al . , 2019 , Uzzi et al . , 2013 , Wagner et al . , 2019 ] . As highly cited work is often associated with a combination of novel and conventional ideas [ Uzzi et al . , 2013 ] , teams of researchers may be more adept at generating novel ideas or striking a balance between novel and traditional concepts than individual authors . 2 For an up - to - date and comprehensive review , see Wang and Barab´asi [ 2021 ] . 4 Successful team performances put individuals and their interactions at the heart of the creative process . Over recent decades , the perception of teamwork has undergone significant changes . In the early 1990s , the prevailing belief was that groups should not be used for creativity because of inherent process loss in the creative process . This perspective has shifted dramatically , and team collaboration is now considered a critical factor in promoting creativity [ Paulus and Nijstad , 2003 ] . Creativity relies on individual’s existing knowledge base : “ Creative thinking cannot hap - pen unless the thinker already possesses knowledge of a rich and / or well - structured kind ” [ Boden , 2001 ] . Knowledge exists on a continuum , ranging from explicit to tacit [ Nonaka , 1994 ] . The gen - eration of new knowledge occurs through interactions between explicit and tacit knowledge via a process known as the socialization , externalization , combination , and internalization ( SECI ) spiral . Tahamtan and Bornmann [ 2018 ] highlighted various approaches reported by researchers for foster - ing creativity . Engaging in conversations with colleagues seems to remain central to problem - solving and generating new , practical ideas . Hence , new ideas are becoming more challenging to discover as the idea space expands linearly while scientific publications grow exponentially [ Bloom et al . , 2020 , Milojevi´c , 2015 ] . As scientific knowledge increases , team sizes grow , and agents increasingly specialize their competencies [ Jones et al . , 2008 , Jones , 2009 ] . The burst of possible combinations in the knowledge space suggests that agents can more ef - fectively recombine information locally [ Fleming , 2001 ] . “Local search” for an inventor involves exploiting existing combinations or using standard technological components . Agents tend to di - rect their research towards familiar subjects , focusing on topics related to their expertise or that of their co - authors ( local search / exploitation ) [ Fleming , 2001 , Nelson , 1985 , March , 1991 ] . Conversely , exploration ( or ”distant search” ) is characterized by using new components or testing novel com - binations [ Fleming , 2001 , March , 1991 ] . The nature of the new combinations realized depends on agents’ trade - offs between exploiting and exploring the knowledge landscape . Exploitation reduces the risk of failure , as researchers draw from experience with combinations and architectures that have previously failed [ Vincenti , 1990 ] . Researchers must then collaborate with others to explore the knowledge space more efficiently , and the team’s composition might determine this balance between exploration and exploitation . 2 . 2 Team characteristics in the creative process We review here some dimensions of the team composition that affect the scientific process . Size dimension : The importance of co - authors during the process of creativity has been de - bated in the literature , and the effect of team size and composition on creativity has been the focus of multiple studies [ Paulus and Nijstad , 2003 , Shin and Zhou , 2007 , Wuchty et al . , 2007 , Falk - Krzesinski et al . , 2011 , Erren et al . , 2017 , Mueller , 2019 ] . Team size shapes and is shaped by the nature of the work carried out . Large teams tend to be more risk - averse and consolidate a field rather than introducing new opportunities [ Christensen and Christensen , 2003 , Paulus et al . , 2013 , Lakhani et al . , 2013 , Wu et al . , 2019 ] . Larger teams use more up - to - date and influential research in their work , consequently fostering greater engagement within their scientific community and further increasing their impact [ Wu et al . , 2019 ] . However , large teams are more prone to coordination and communication failures as the entire team must have faith in the project to succeed , as agree - ment and communication between team members can be challenging and time - consuming [ Bikard 5 et al . , 2015 ] . In fact , the number of people involved in a project can have heterogeneous effects on creativity , and no optimal team size fits every project . A small team may be more useful in the conceptualization phase , while a larger team might be beneficial in the implementation and testing phase of the project [ Wang and Barab´asi , 2021 ] . Shin and Zhou [ 2007 ] highlight the organization’s importance for creativity . Using evidence from Cambridge and AT & T’s Bell Laboratories ( home to numerous Nobel Prize winners ) , they discuss researchers’ ideal context for fostering creativity and conclude that the presence of a healthy environment for a small group of people ( up to seven ) promotes creativity . These results are further confirmed by Lee et al . [ 2015 ] and Carayol et al . [ 2019 ] , indicating that the relationship between team size and novelty appears U - shaped and is highly heterogeneous across disciplines . Structural and relational social capital : Nahapiet and Ghoshal [ 1998 ] conceptualize three di - mensions of social capital that impact intellectual capital development : structural , relational and cognitive . Though primarily used to understand intellectual capital development in organizations and firms , the dimensions of social capital presented in Nahapiet and Ghoshal [ 1998 ] can be applied to the context of knowledge production in science due to their intrinsic relevance to relationship and network dynamics [ Liao , 2011 ] . Structural capital examines the links between individuals , and structural distances have been widely studied through collaboration networks ( see Kumar [ 2015 ] for an extensive review on network collaborations ) . Relational capital represents the nature and intensity of the connections between team members . A critical factor in intellectual development is the ability to communicate with each other , and the actors’ experience reinforces the phenomena [ Taylor and Greve , 2006 , Liao , 2011 , Kelchtermans et al . , 2020 ] . For instance , McFadyen and Can - nella Jr [ 2004 ] emphasize the role of the intensity of past relationships between scientists in fostering new knowledge . Indeed , members with strong relationships , norms , obligations , and mutual trust tend to communicate more easily [ Liao , 2011 ] . Other relational aspects , such as hierarchical or geographical dimensions , also impact the knowledge space exploration . For example , supervising doctoral students is not only associated with entering new areas but also extending towards more distant fields [ Kelchtermans et al . , 2020 ] Cognitive social capital : The cognitive capital remains challenging to measure as it is linked to the shared background between coauthors and their common language . Cognitive diversity is often encouraged through interdisciplinary projects as the intersection of different perspectives is commonly required to solve complex scientific problems [ Page , 2008 ] . Indeed , people from outside a domain may have some advantage to offer fresh ideas through their distinct knowledge [ Jeppesen and Lakhani , 2010 , Kuhn , 1962 ] . The effectiveness of generating new knowledge is impacted by factors such as variations in background , belief and reasoning styles among scientists , all of which contribute to cognitive diversity . The cognitive distance between team members is expected to display an inverted U - shaped correlation with both learning and innovation [ Nooteboom et al . , 2007 ] , as people being too distant will face difficulty in communicating , and those being cognitively too similar benefit less from distinct perspectives in the knowledge creation process . Cognitive distances between individuals can be studied through various metrics . Kumar et al . [ 2017 ] used , for example , citations networks and citations context in full text . Boudreau et al . 6 [ 2016 ] represented the cognitive distance between funding evaluators and the proposal through MeSH terms similarity . Similarly , Ayoubi et al . [ 2017 ] represent the distance between the focal scientist and her team by comparing cosine similarities of referenced journals from scientists’ past publications . Other measurements , without being explicit , may relate to cognitive dimensions , Wagner et al . [ 2019 ] discovered that international collaborations negatively affect novelty and pro - duce more conventional knowledge combinations , highlighting barriers and transaction costs that influence the production of creative work . Finally , measures of cognitive distance strongly relate to interdisciplinarity . Petersen et al . [ 2021 ] represent author diversity using the discipline of the institution . Bramoulle and Ductor [ 2018 ] calculate team specialization using the Herfindahl index , derived from the proportion of past publications across different fields as indicated by the first digit of JEL codes . They find this specialization negatively impacts combinatorial novelty . Using au - thors’ disciplinary diversity , Abramo et al . [ 2018 ] show that more distant coauthors produce articles with more diverse references . Exploratory profile : Individual characteristics and the ability to interact with individuals from different fields are essential to efficiently managing cognitive diversity in a team . When the distance between disciplines is too high , a “Renaissance” individual [ Jones , 2009 ] can ease their connection [ Wu et al . , 2022 ] . The presence of a scientist with a multifaceted profile bridges the gap between the different backgrounds of other team members . This is crucial as a shared knowledge base between researchers streamlines the socialization process and facilitates knowledge recombination , fostering creativity . Shin and Zhou [ 2007 ] focused on the relationship between diversity ( interdisciplinarity ) and creative ideas in groups . Shin and Zhou [ 2007 ] ’s idea is that the presence of a ”transformational leader” , whose role is to mediate between individuals , each specialized in a different field , leads to greater team creativity . Xu et al . [ 2022 ] provided a first answer to this hypothesis by examining the share of team members engaged in the conceptual work , the L - ratio , which was deduced from the analysis of author contribution reports . The findings suggest that hierarchical teams generate less novelty than egalitarian teams and tend to develop existing ideas more frequently . 3 We argue that the notion of transformational leader or renaissance individual is connected to exploratory profile ` a la March [ 1991 ] , individuals enabled to link others in the knowledge space due to their ability to navigate in different spaces . 2 . 3 Exploring the cognitive dimension We investigate scientific impact through citation networks and recent indicators of disruption and breath and depth Wu et al . [ 2019 ] , Wu and Wu [ 2019 ] , Bu et al . [ 2019 ] , Bornmann et al . [ 2019a ] . These indicators determine whether a document consolidates a domain or constitutes a founding step . To explore its influence on novelty , we use two approaches , one based on combinatorial novelty indicators [ Uzzi et al . , 2013 , Lee et al . , 2015 , Foster et al . , 2015 , Wang et al . , 2017 , Shibayama et al . , 2021 ] and one based on external validation via Faculty Opinion ( previously called F1000 ) following Bornmann et al . [ 2019b ] . Faculty Opinion is a website hosting reviews of papers tagged as present - 3 Interestingly , their method was expanded in an article with no contribution reports . Through Louvain algo - rithms , they identified clusters of co - occurring research activities in their first dataset . They then built a neural network to infer author roles based on their characteristics and predicted it for 16 million articles on Microsoft Academic Graph ( MAG ) . 7 ing “New Results” , “Novel Drug target” , “Technical advancement” , “Interesting hypothesis” , and “Controversial results” , among other categorizations labelled by experts in the field . It allows us to empirically assess the capacity of novelty indicators and our indicators to predict the novelty as perceived by other researchers in the community . Novelty indicators have been compared and evaluated based on citation count [ Uzzi et al . , 2013 , Lee et al . , 2015 , Foster et al . , 2015 , Wang et al . , 2017 ] . Fontana et al . [ 2020 ] compared Wang et al . [ 2017 ] and Uzzi et al . [ 2013 ] , Lee et al . [ 2015 ] using randomized citation networks and demonstrated the ability of the Uzzi et al . [ 2013 ] , Lee et al . [ 2015 ] indicators to better track novelty . Their findings are supported by using some Nobel Prize winners’ articles and a list of APS milestone articles . Other studies have evaluated these indicators based on surveys , such as Shibayama et al . [ 2021 ] and Matsumoto et al . [ 2021 ] , whereas Bornmann et al . [ 2019b ] have evaluated them based on labels collected on Faculty Opinion and found similar results as in Fontana et al . [ 2020 ] . However , only a few indicators have been compared and tested simultaneously . This study intends to validate the effect of the cognitive dimension on a large variety of metrics . Our indicator is not a substitute for other novelty indicators . It does not represent the novelty of an article as it is based upon previous information and would be similar even without the focal article . Instead , it provides an understanding of team composition that would benefit creativity in science . We can think of our measure as a measure of potential novelty , i . e . opportunities for new knowledge recombination available through the diversity of background in the team and the capacity of individuals to bridge the gap between other team members . In comparison , combina - torial novelty indicators would capture then the realized novelty , i . e . the output of the research conducted by this team in terms of pieces of knowledge used . Finally , Faculty Opinion labelling and other external validation methods can describe the perceived novelty , i . e . the peers’ perception of this study . Hence , in these terms , we ask whether potential novelty contributes to realized and perceived novelty and its scientific recognition . Two research questions can be drawn regarding the effect of the cognitive dimension on creativity . Do teams with higher cognitive diversity are more likely to approach a subject creatively , demonstrating originality ( perceived and realized ) and recognition ? Does the presence of exploratory individuals within a team enhance communication among members and facilitate their exploration of the knowledge space to develop new and relevant solutions to research problems ? Studying the cognitive dimension of creativity in science is of great interest , especially as it can help identify how to improve collaboration and communication among researchers with diverse cognitive profiles . Through our metric , we also offer a different approach to resource allocation decisions , giving another picture of teams with a high potential for creative output . 3 Data and methods 3 . 1 Measuring cognitive diversity and exploratory profile The proposed metric examines the semantic heterogeneity of researchers’ work as a proxy for their cognitive diversity . It thus offers an alternative to using categories , keywords , or citation networks , more complex to be monitored directly by the researchers themselves . Following Hain et al . [ 2020 ] 8 and [ Shibayama et al . , 2021 ] , we can embed this list of documents in a vectorial space to apply a distance measure such as cosine similarity [ Mikolov et al . , 2013b ] . We assume that an author of a paper in a specific position within the semantic space possesses knowledge embedded around that position . Our indicator has two properties : it offers a measure of researchers’ profiles at the individual level and a measure of distances between them . Consequently , we can proxy the trade - off between exploitation and exploration that a researcher undergoes throughout their career ( intra - individual ) and the trade - off materializing during the formation of a team ( inter - individual ) within the same mathematical space . Figure 1 : Construction of the indicator As explained in Figure 1 , we track authors to create a list of authors’ past publications . Then , we can create a cognitive profile for each author at a given time t ; each publication is embedded in the semantic space and represents the cognitive landscape of the author . We restrict to publications up to b years before t to account for researchers’ current topics of interest and difficulty retaining information [ Argote et al . , 1990 ] . We can finally define a researcher’s exploratory profile at time t by calculating pairs of cosine distances between past papers published . This will create a density of cosine distances which , using the taxonomy of March [ 1991 ] , can be interpreted the following way : the fatter the right ( left ) tail is , the more exploratory ( exploitative ) the researcher . The same holds for the team . A sizeable right tail indicates a cognitively distant researchers team . This provides us with information on how distant their knowledge base is from others . Note that our measure implicitly incorporate the fact that cognitive distance between two researchers decreases with when frequency of interaction increase , as more articles will be similar when calculating the distribution of distance between the two researchers . An intra - author and inter - author distribution enables a wide exploration of the relationship between novelty , creativity , and teams . We model our measures on two different perspectives as represented in Figure 2 : intra - author distances , which asses exploratory profile , and inter - authors distances , to capture cognitive diver - sity . A given focal paper ( FP ) is written by two authors named ’A’ . We retrieve each author’s past production , named ’P’ . On the one hand , we can then calculate the distance between all publica - tions from a given author ( intra - author distances ) . On the other hand , we can also compare past publications from two authors ( inter - author distances ) . We can build our framework using directed bipartite networks , defined as G ( U , V , E ) . U represents the set nodes for authors , V is the set for 9 Figure 2 : Exploratory profile and cognitive diversity articles , and E is the set of links between authors and articles . We only consider collaborations between authors when looking at a given article ; collaboration is implicit since the set of parents of a given document FP ∈ V corresponds to the set of authors that collaborate . For a given document FP , an author that has contributed to FP is noted a , and the set of nodes that contributes to FP is then In FP = { a ∈ U : ( a , FP ) ∈ E } . We want to retrieve all past publications for all authors in In FP . The global set of publications before FP is noted V t − b FP , the set of articles published b years before the document FP . The set of past publications for author a ∈ In FP is noted Out t − b a = { v ∈ V t − b FP : ( a , v ) ∈ E } . For a document FP and an author a ∈ In FP , we retrieve the set of past publications Out t − b a . All Out t − b a elements vectorial representations are compared , from which distribution of cosine distances are calculated . The distance between two documents i , j ∈ Out t − b a is d ij = 1 − COS ( T i , T j ) where T i is the dense vector text representation for document i . Intra - author semantic distances : A distribution of semantic distance score D a is computed through cosine similarity using all document i , j ∈ Out t − b a , the process is repeated for each authors a ∈ In FP . The intra - author distance for a given author a is the q - th percentile ( P q ) of this distribution and is written as : Intra a = P q ( D a ) A general distribution of the intra - authors publication distances is constructed using the set of distances for all authors A FP = { D a : a ∈ In FP } , the individual trade - off between exploitation / - exploration is then captured through the average of the exploratory profiles in a given team . 10 Intra FP = (cid:80) a ( P q ( D a ) ) | In FP | Inter - authors semantic distances : A distribution of semantic distance score between authors’ pre - vious work is constructed by comparing different authors’ publications . For two given authors a , e ∈ In FP , | Out t − b a | × | Out t − b e | distances are used to construct the distribution of distances D a , e between a and e . The final distribution then groups together all distances between authors’ pre - vious works B FP = { D a , e : a , e ∈ In FP } , the trade - off between exploitation / exploration in team composition is captured through the percentile of B FP : Inter FP = P q ( B FP ) Current techniques for large - scale author disambiguation allow the investigation of individual trajectories in science . However , the use of this information comes with a computational cost . This indicator pushes towards a massive use of data because one needs all authors’ past publications for a given set of documents . Structuring the data to compute the measure is time - consuming and data - intensive . One needs indeed all papers’ text from all authors in a given database . However , using pre - trained embedding models allows direct computing indicators without the requirement of complete database access . Therefore , measures are not dependent on the study sample as indicators of novelty based on cooccurrence matrices but rather on the sample used to train the model . Also , by processing titles and abstracts through embedding techniques , the authors’ background is represented with greater granularity than through the keywords or the journals where the authors have been published . 3 . 2 Data Our analysis relies on two databases . The first , PubMed Knowledge Graph ( PKG ) , allows us to test the effect of the cognitive dimension on scientific impact and realized novelty of articles , while the second , Faculty Opinion verifies whether the cognitive dimension affects the perceived novelty by peers . We use Pubmed Knowledge Graph ( PKG ) , a collection of 35 million scientific papers and books from life science and biomedical journals provided by the National Library of Medicine ( NLM ) at the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) . Authors are disambiguated by leveraging Natural Language Processing ( NLP ) and online data , as outlined by Xu et al . [ 2020 ] . We based our analysis on all the 3 . 5M articles written by 3 , 276 , 250 authors and published in 9 , 348 journals between 2000 and 2005 . We selected fairly old data due to the nature of the process studied . Indeed , novel articles are more likely to become ”sleeping beauties” and accumulate citations in the long run [ Lin et al . , 2021 ] . Also to compute novelty indicators , we require information about references . We rely both on abstracts of references to embed their semantics and calculate the distance as in Shibayama et al . [ 2021 ] . Also , we use past publication references’ journals to build past cooccurrence matrices used to capture combination existence and difficulty for other novelty indicators . For this purpose , we used the database between 1980 and 2005 to get all information needed , representing 11 , 261 , 955 documents . 11 To test if our indicators affect the novelty perceived by peers , we used Faculty Opinion following Bornmann et al . [ 2019b ] . Faculty Opinion is a database featuring papers tagged as presenting ’New Results’ , ’Novel Drug target’ , ’Technical advancement’ , ’Interesting hypothesis’ , and ’Controversial results’ , among other categorizations determined by the platform users . The platform hosts reviews of the most significant research in Biology and Medicine . This makes it easy to match the articles in the database with PKG . Indeed , from the 190k articles in Faculty Opinion , we found 27 , 122 in our sample ( 2000 - 2005 ) . 3 . 3 Empirical strategy To explore the relationship between the team’s cognitive dimension and its ability to recombine pieces of knowledge in novel ways and achieve recognition , we start with a basic exploratory data analysis followed by three econometric analyses to test our hypotheses . The first two analyses aim to understand how a team’s cognitive diversity and the exploratory profiles of its members impact perceived novelty ( i . e . , peer labelling on Faculty Opinion ) and realized novelty ( i . e . , indicators of combinatorial novelty ) . Then our analysis seeks to comprehend the effect of the cognitive dimension on scientific recognition using citation and disruption measures . Realized novelty and scientific impact connections with cognitive dimension are both investigated through PKG , the normalization performed at the field and year levels of this measure provides a measure ranging between 0 and 1 , which we model using linear models with cluster robust standard errors at the journal level . Lastly , we examine how the presence of highly exploratory and exploitative individuals influences the team’s creativity . This analysis will help determine if cognitive diversity and the presence of exploratory profiles are explicitly visible in an article’s knowledge composition . For the analysis of perceived novelty , we employ the Faculty Opinion database and model , through Logit and Poisson regressions , the likelihood of an article being labelled with “novel” categories ( “Technical Advance” , “Interesting Hypothesis” , “Novel Drug Target” ) . In our sample , 80 % of the observations are labelled as ’New Findings’ , and 95 % of the total sample would be considered new using the top 4 most represented categories ( 22 , 216 novel articles versus 1 , 750 not - novel ) . The fact that most articles are labelled as new findings makes this category less informative ; therefore , we decided to exclude it and remove articles solely labelled with this category . As a result , our prediction is based on a more balanced sample ( 8 , 950 novel articles versus 3 , 605 not - novel ) . This will enable us to understand whether the cognitive dimension is associated with perceived novelty . We do not expect a direct effect but rather hypothesize that cognitive diversity influences a latent variable representing the article’s actual contribution . This actual contribution of the paper may or may not be visible in the realized novelty measured by novelty indicators but might be then reflected in labelling made by peers . 3 . 4 Variables Variables used in our empirical analysis can be separated into four categories : novelty indicators , scientific impact , cognitive , and control variables . For control variables , aside from data from PKG , we use journals listed in Scimago to control for scientific domains and measure of the impact 12 associated with the journal . Each of our variables is at the paper level . For the empirical strategy , novelty , impact and cognitive measures will be field weighted by year using the percentile rank procedure – noted ( FW ) . We use the first category of the journal from Scimago to approximate the field . Novelty indicators The indicators used in our analysis are Uzzi et al . [ 2013 ] , Lee et al . [ 2015 ] , Foster et al . [ 2015 ] , Wang et al . [ 2017 ] , Shibayama et al . [ 2021 ] . A formal mathematical description of them can be found in Pelletier and Wirtz [ 2022 ] . Note that we have inversed the sign of the measures related to Uzzi et al . [ 2013 ] for simplicity and comparison with other indicators . The computation is done with Novelpy , a python package that allows computing novelty and disruptiveness indicators . 4 . Scientific impact variables For impact measures , we use citation counts and disruptiveness indicators , also described in Pelletier and Wirtz [ 2022 ] . We used all available indicators in Novelpy , namely : Wu et al . [ 2019 ] , Bu et al . [ 2019 ] and Bornmann et al . [ 2019a ] . Cognitive variables Team cognitive diversity : The mean of the inter - authors semantic distance as defined in Section 3 . 1 with q = 90 for a given paper . It measures to what extent a team is composed of highly cognitively distant authors ( i . e . Author 1 background is vastly dissimilar to Author 2 background ) . Further - more , we suppose the relation between the team’s cognitive diversity and other measures is not linear . We take the square of the team’s cognitive diversity to test this . Average exploratory profile : The mean of the intra - authors semantic distance as defined in Section 3 . 1 with q = 90 for a given paper . It captures to what extent a team comprises authors with distant past publications ( i . e . Author 1 worked on diverse subjects ) . As for team cognitive diversity , we add a square term in the regressions . Number of highly exploratory authors : To have more information on the team structure , we decided to define a threshold to identify highly exploratory authors . Looking at the intra - author’s semantic distance as defined in Section 3 . 1 . An author is considered highly exploratory if its 90 t h percentile is in the top 10 % of all Intra FP in our sample . Number of highly exploitative authors : We expect highly exploratory authors to work best with highly exploitative authors ( i . e . Novelty is probably most successful with a combination of typical and atypical individuals ) . We construct this measure following the same procedure as exploratory authors . Looking at the intra - author’s semantic distance as defined in Section 3 . 1 . An author is considered highly exploitative if its 90 t h percentile is below our sample’s median of all Intra FP . 4 See https : / / novelpy . readthedocs . io / 13 Interaction term between highly exploratory and highly exploitative authors : We added an interac - tion term between the two types of profiles to understand how they complement each other . Control variables We included as control variables the number of authors , references and MeSH terms . We also con - trolled for the year and information related to the journal of publication . Scimago Journal Ranking ( SJR ) : An indicator of a journal’s prestige based on weighted citation and eigenvector centrality derived from Scopus’ citation networks by Scimago [ Gonz´alez - Pereira et al . , 2009 ] . Scimago Journal Category : Scimago provides a classification of journals based on various fields . We used the first category linked to a journal ; our database contains journals from 271 categories . 3 . 5 Descriptive statistics and preliminary evidence We further clean our database and restrict it to papers with at least 2 references / MeSHterms / authors and with a journal ISSN . Our final dataset represents approximately 2 . 1M articles . Table 1 presents the descriptive statistics for the variables in our sample . Examining their distribution , it is worth noting that some indicators concentrate novelty around a small number of articles , as in Foster et al . [ 2015 ] or in Wang et al . [ 2017 ] , merely 21 % of the articles possess non - zero values ( measured on references ) . Also , indicators such as citation count or Uzzi et al . [ 2013 ] among others , display relatively extreme values . Specifically for Uzzi et al . [ 2013 ] , it is highly dependent on the z - score computation , when the variance of the journal combination is minimal , the z - score can rapidly become substantial . These disparities in distribution prompted us to apply a percentile rank procedure by field and year , as explained in the previous subsection . The correlogram in Figure 3 illustrates the various indicators’ interconnection . A hierarchical clustering algorithm is applied to the correlation matrix and several clusters emerge . It includes citation and consolidation indicators , novelty indicators , cognitive dimension indicators , and disrup - tion indicators . Regardless of whether MeSH terms or references are used to derive the indicators , the novelty indicators group remains consistent , suggesting that combinatorial novelty indicators capture a shared underlying dimension of innovation in scientific research . The correlation between Lee et al . [ 2015 ] and Uzzi et al . [ 2013 ] is particularly robust since both measures are nearly identical except for the incorporation of the reference’s publication year in Uzzi et al . [ 2013 ] ’s resampling process . It should be noted that a negative correlation is expected since low values signify atyp - icality in Uzzi et al . [ 2013 ] , while high values represent novelty in Lee et al . [ 2015 ] , this is why we inverse the sign of Uzzi et al . [ 2013 ] to get positive correlation between indicators . A strong correlation is observed between Shibayama et al . [ 2021 ] and our indicators , as it employs the same measurement on references , and some elements may overlap . Specifically , self - citation increases the correlations between Shibayama et al . [ 2021 ] and our indicator since the same combinations are calculated in the author and reference parts . Moreover , the clustering differentiates between cita - tion count , consolidation indicators ( Depth , DeIN ) , and disruption indicators ( DI1 , DI5 , DI1nok , and Breadth ) . These distinctions emphasize how consolidation indicators are more closely related 14 Table 1 : Descriptive statistics Statistic Min . Pctl ( 25 ) Median Mean Pctl ( 75 ) Max St . Dev .

The development of an author - level indicator necessitates examining its relationship with team size . Figure 4 illustrates how intra - and inter - individual cognitive indicators are strongly associated with team size . Although it is unclear whether cognitive diversity generates a specific team size or if team size produces this diversity , it is visible that as the cognitive diversity within a team increases , the average exploratory profile must also rise to maintain a comparable team size . The hump - shape relationship on both sides is easily observable , suggesting that the more diverse the team and / or the more exploratory the individuals , the smaller the team . Conversely , highly homogeneous teams typically imply smaller average team sizes , even if the average exploratory profile is high . This pattern is partially attributable to the construction of our indicator , which averages distance . In larger teams high distance between members might be compensated by other members that are close to each other . This counterbalancing is less pronounced in smaller teams , resulting in more extreme values . However , several explanations for this phenomenon can be offered . For instance , substantial cognitive diversity might create communication barriers among team members , particularly when individuals are less exploratory . Consequently , smaller teams are formed due to potential coordination and knowledge exchange difficulties . In cases with a high average exploratory 15 Figure 3 : Correlogram with hierarchical clustering profile combined with high cognitive diversity , forming smaller teams may be more convenient , as researchers might explore the knowledge space too broadly . Smaller teams could help prevent efforts from dispersing in various directions . As for teams with low cognitive diversity , the absence of cognitive diversity and exploratory profiles could relate to niches where individuals possess similar knowledge and expertise . As a result , many team members might not be necessary , as they can efficiently navigate the local knowledge space . The same argument can be made for individuals with comparable skills and exploratory profiles , as they may represent teams that regularly collaborate on diverse topics . The distinct skill requirements for these teams may be lower , leading to smaller team sizes . Interestingly , when comparing the analysis of team size with disruption , we confirm the findings of Wu and Wu [ 2019 ] . As illustrated in Figure 6 in the Appendix , peripheral observations are more disruptive ( represented with DI1nok ) , corresponding to the location of our smaller teams in Figure 4 right panel . Teams consolidating science , as indicated by the Depth variable , are also , on average , the most prominent teams . Small teams that disrupt science tend to have exploratory profiles and / or diverse team compositions . Science disruption seems to occur through small teams with either highly distinct skills or very exploratory profiles . What seems essential is the ability to access a broader knowledge space , regardless of whether this space is reached through the team’s highly exploratory profiles or the team’s diversity . Teams composed of individuals who are , on average , highly exploratory but with low team cognitive diversity represent teams with similar skills that cover the knowledge space effectively . In contrast , highly diverse teams with specialized individuals also span the knowledge space to propose disruptive ideas , although they may face communication 16 challenges . The combination of these two factors also appears to contribute to disruption , albeit less prominently , suggesting the detrimental effect of excessive diversity . Another inverted U - shaped relationship exists between a team’s average exploratory profile and novelty indicators . When balanced by a relatively exploratory average profile , cognitive diversity appears beneficial without showing a saturation point . Figure 4 : Team size , exploratory profiles and cognitive diversity The relationship differs when we adopt an alternative perspective and consider the proportion of highly exploratory and exploitative individuals within scientific teams . A dome is visible in each indicator , signifying successful trade - offs between exploitation and exploration . Figure 5 offers insight into the relationship between these two aspects and scientific recognition and combinato - rial novelty . Teams with fewer highly exploratory individuals and a higher proportion of highly exploitative individuals typically contribute to consolidating the field ( Depth metric ) . Conversely , groups with a higher proportion of highly exploratory individuals and a smaller proportion of highly exploitative individuals are more likely to initiate disruptions in their fields ( DI1nok metric ) . These observations complement the findings of Uzzi et al . [ 2013 ] , which suggest that a balance between conventional and atypical knowledge combinations produces the most impactful research . More - over , this analysis enables us to examine how the balance between exploratory and exploitative individuals affects knowledge creation itself . Teams featuring a fair proportion of exploratory individuals and a more sustained level of ex - ploitative individuals seem to be most likely to generate compelling new combinations of knowledge . Figure 5 suggests that an optimal team composition would consist of approximately 50 % highly exploitative and 20 % highly exploratory individuals to increase the likelihood of combining distant knowledge . The situation is less clear for Shibayama et al . [ 2021 ] , where a high proportion of highly exploratory individuals appears to be beneficial 5 . Exploratory individuals contribute to the team by introducing fresh and innovative ideas from their extensive knowledge . These individuals can 5 This might be connected with the relationship between our measure and the measure of Shibayama et al . [ 2021 ] as it is measured in a similar manner . Self - citation also directly impacts the relationship between these two metrics as the same combination of articles will be calculated in both metrics . 17 Figure 5 : Relation between the share of highly exploitative and highly exploratory profile in a team with and Novelty / Scientific Impact challenge conventional thinking and steer the team in new directions . Simultaneously , they might foster communication among group members with distant knowledge . In contrast , highly exploita - tive individuals are crucial for refining and optimizing these novel ideas . Their specialized expertise allows the team to identify feasible and effective solutions , ensuring the creative potential of the exploratory individuals is appropriately channelled into tangible outputs . Additionally , their deep understanding of a specific field facilitates effective communication . The highly exploratory profile complements the specialized knowledge and proficiency of the highly exploitative team members . This dynamic enables the team to capitalize on the full potential of their diverse cognitive abilities , optimizing the innovation process and yielding scientific advancements . 4 Results 4 . 1 Cognitive dimension and novelty Realized novelty This subsection examines the relationship between the team’s cognitive dimension and novelty indicators . To this end , we report the results of an OLS to identify the joint impact of authors’ intra - diversity and inter - diversity on the indicators . The outcomes of these models are presented in Table 2 . First , we confirm that cognitive diversity in a scientific team fosters realized novelty . Team cognitive diversity ( Row 1 - 2 ) reveals a significant positive effect on combinatorial novelty . This suggests distant individuals can ease the combination of distant journals in the references .

Standard errors are cluster robust at the journal level : * * * , * * and * indicate significance at the 1 % , 5 % and 10 % levels , respec - tively . The effects are estimated with an OLS . Variables are field - weighted and constant term , scientific field ( Scimago Journal Category ) , and time - fixed effects are incorporated in all model specifications . squared term has negative coefficients . However , the turning point is higher than 1 , meaning the relationship is strictly increasing ( See Table 13 in Appendix ) . However , it means that the marginal benefit of cognitive distance is decreasing . When interpreting the coefficients , it is important to remember that the independent and dependent variables are expressed in percentile rank within a given field and year . A one percentage point increase in the independent variable’s percentile rank implies a β percentage point increase in the dependent variable . In our case , the marginal effect of a quadratic term depends on the value of the independent variable . We can calculate marginal effects at the mean values of the independent variable . For example , in Uzzi et al . [ 2013 ] ( model 1 ) , the marginal effect of Author inter abs ( FW ) at the mean value is calculated this way : 19 ∆ y ∆ ( inter ) = 0 . 169 − 2 ∗ ( − 0 . 031 ) ∗ Mean ( Inter ) . Since variables are expressed in percentile rank , the mean and the median are 0 . 5 . The marginal effect can be then calculated easily , ∆ y ∆ ( inter ) = 0 . 169 − ∗ ( − 0 . 031 ) = 0 . 2 . This means that by increasing one percentage point on the ranking of team diversity in a given field and year , one can increase by 0 . 2 percentage points in the ranking of the most novel articles in the field and year . On the contrary , the average exploratory profile must remain reasonable to maximize novelty . As visible in Table 13 , the turning points are around 30 % for all indicators except Shibayama et al . [ 2021 ] , for which it is upper than one . This can mean two things , and this is what we will examine in the second part of this results section , either the researchers have a rather moderate exploratory profile , or there is a balance between exploratory and exploitative individuals . A set of profiles that are too exploratory seems detrimental , as does a set of too exploitative profiles . As shown in Table 2 , this holds for all indicators on references , except for Wang et al . [ 2017 ] , for which the individual effect is negative , one explanation can be the fact that Wang et al . [ 2017 ] control for future reutilization of the novel combination . Indeed this gives a ’scientific impact’ dimension to the metrics and the presence of more specialized individuals may impact the relevance of the combination for the community , making it more likely to be reused . On MeSH terms , as visible in Table 11 in the Appendix , individual exploratory aspects appear to have a direct negative impact . Indexers assign the MeSH terms and may be subject to bias or misinterpretation . In contrast , the references directly relate to the researchers’ choices and reflect their interests and preferences . There are two possibilities , indexers may be unable to capture all the nuances and subtleties of research conducted by individuals with high - average exploratory profiles . Alternatively , the novelty of references could be induced by an author bias in citing previous works irrelevant to the contribution . Researchers’ past publications do not directly impact indexers , so she might not need to qualify the article with distant MeSH terms because the novelty is not sufficiently explicit . This suggests that MeSH terms do not reflect the diversity of knowledge and ideas present in individual past work but rather the diversity of competencies between team members . These relations remain consistent when regressions are not performed using percentage rank information , and indicator behavior with MeSH terms and references seems to be much more cor - roborated , as visible in Table 14 and 15 in the Appendix . The fact that the effect is nearly the same on most of the indicators of novelty demonstrates the robustness of this analysis - our measure cap - tures something similar regardless of the construction of the novelty indicator and the information used . The potential for novelty seems more apparent when looking at the exact composition in terms of exploratory profiles , i . e . , the share of exploratory individuals and the share of highly exploitative individuals . In Table 3 , we replace the average exploratory profile variables with the exploitative and exploratory individual shares and the interaction of these two variables . While cognitive diversity appears to be always beneficial to combine new knowledge , the presence of too many exploratory individuals is harmful . Indeed , its presence only becomes beneficial when counterbalanced by a higher share of exploitative individuals . We can clearly see how this trade - off is necessary to create novelty in the regressions . In the same way as before , the coefficients can be interpreted directly , a percentage point increase in the share of highly exploratory individuals 20 Table 3 : Combinatorial Novelty : Cognitive diversity , highly exploratory and exploitative profile ( Field - Weighted / References ) Dependent variable : Uzzi Lee Foster Wang Shibayama ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ( 3 ) ( 4 ) ( 5 ) Author inter abs ( FW ) 0 . 168 ∗∗∗ 0 . 163 ∗∗∗ 0 . 107 ∗∗∗ 0 . 066 ∗∗∗ 0 . 400 ∗∗∗ ( 0 . 014 ) ( 0 . 012 ) ( 0 . 020 ) ( 0 . 008 ) ( 0 . 012 ) Author inter abs ˆ2 ( FW ) - 0 . 007 - 0 . 006 0 . 028 0 . 001 - 0 . 160 ∗∗∗ ( 0 . 012 ) ( 0 . 011 ) ( 0 . 018 ) ( 0 . 007 ) ( 0 . 012 ) Share exploratory - 0 . 166 ∗∗∗ - 0 . 173 ∗∗∗ - 0 . 214 ∗∗∗ - 0 . 084 ∗∗∗ - 0 . 022 ∗∗∗ ( 0 . 007 ) ( 0 . 007 ) ( 0 . 010 ) ( 0 . 004 ) ( 0 . 006 ) Share exploitative 0 . 027 ∗∗∗ 0 . 053 ∗∗∗ 0 . 057 ∗∗∗ 0 . 002 - 0 . 092 ∗∗∗ ( 0 . 003 ) ( 0 . 003 ) ( 0 . 005 ) ( 0 . 002 ) ( 0 . 004 ) Share exploratory * Share exploitative 0 . 298 ∗∗∗ 0 . 273 ∗∗∗ 0 . 390 ∗∗∗ 0 . 080 ∗∗∗ - 0 . 112 ∗∗∗ ( 0 . 016 ) ( 0 . 016 ) ( 0 . 020 ) ( 0 . 011 ) ( 0 . 018 ) # References 0 . 002 ∗∗∗ 0 . 002 ∗∗∗ 0 . 001 ∗∗∗ 0 . 005 ∗∗∗ 0 . 002 ∗∗∗ ( 0 . 0001 ) ( 0 . 0001 ) ( 0 . 0001 ) ( 0 . 0001 ) ( 0 . 0001 ) # Meshterms 0 . 004 ∗∗∗ 0 . 006 ∗∗∗ 0 . 005 ∗∗∗ - 0 . 001 ∗∗∗ 0 . 004 ∗∗∗ ( 0 . 0004 ) ( 0 . 0003 ) ( 0 . 0003 ) ( 0 . 0002 ) ( 0 . 0004 ) # Authors 0 . 008 ∗∗∗ 0 . 007 ∗∗∗ 0 . 007 ∗∗∗ 0 . 001 ∗∗∗ 0 . 006 ∗∗∗ ( 0 . 0004 ) ( 0 . 0004 ) ( 0 . 0005 ) ( 0 . 0002 ) ( 0 . 0003 ) SJR - 0 . 012 ∗∗∗ - 0 . 011 ∗∗∗ - 0 . 014 ∗∗∗ - 0 . 008 ∗∗∗ - 0 . 011 ∗∗∗ ( 0 . 002 ) ( 0 . 001 ) ( 0 . 002 ) ( 0 . 001 ) ( 0 . 001 ) Year Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Journal Cat .

Exploratory individuals will develop new perspectives that specialized individuals will capitalize on to make them succeed . A larger share of specialized individuals facilitates communication among members if they are in the same field ; otherwise , scientists with diverse backgrounds appear to facilitate communication among team members who are cognitively distant [ Page , 2008 ] . This mirrors the ”Renaissance” individual of [ Jones , 2009 ] or the ”transformational leader” of Shin and Zhou [ 2007 ] who can ease connections between distant members and foster the team’s creativity . Too many such individuals would make the exploration less efficient , and the emerging ideas would potentially not be successfully implemented because the embedding of the conducted research in a scientific paradigm would not be sufficient . The results are similar across novelty indicators , ex - cept for Shibayama et al . [ 2021 ] , in which the best team composition is made from non - exploitative , non - highly exploratory researchers . Table 12 in the Appendix shows that the results also hold for indicators based on MeSH terms . The two sets of results on the impact of cognitive distance and researcher profile show that 21 combining specialized and exploratory profiles is a good proxy for potential novelty as it enhances the realized novelty in the team 6 . While Uzzi et al . [ 2013 ] show that this trade - off between con - ventional and atypical combinations of knowledge is the most impactful , we demonstrate that this idea holds at the team level as well and that these configurations are most likely to achieve atypical combinations . Perceived novelty In this subsection , we examine the relationship between the cognitive dimension and novelty as assessed by experts . Specifically , we employ a Logit model to identify the impact of authors’ intra - diversity and inter - diversity on the likelihood of being classified in at least one novel category . The results of these models are presented in Table 4 . The effect of team cognitive diversity plays a positive role in perceived novelty , as seen in the first and second specifications . This effect is less clear when considering individual characteristics . The average exploratory profile has a negative impact . In model 3 , we can see that our previous results on realized novelty ( Table 2 ) only holds for the cognitive distance between individuals when tested on perceived novelty . In contrast , when examining the specifications with the share of highly exploratory and exploitative individuals , the results corroborate the regressions performed on realized novelty . The proportion of highly exploratory individuals has a negative effect . Instead , typical individuals play a positive role , and the intersection of both types of researchers is indeed positive for predicting novelty . Note that in this specification , cognitive diversity between members is no longer significant . However , when examining Table 7 in the Appendix , we can see that the effects are quite hetero - geneous across labels . We chose the four labels for which more than 1000 papers had been classified to perform the regressions . The effect of cognitive distance between team members is visible in the “Technical Advance” category but not significant for the remaining labels . Conversely , in Table 9 , we can see that the results in terms of exploratory profiles are mainly driven by the ’Interesting Hypothesis’ label . Results here are a bit different since we observe a U shape , meaning that highly specialized or highly diverse teams most often publish articles labelled as “Interesting hypotheses” . Results are quite similar when using Poisson regression and modelling the number of times a paper is labelled in a given category as visible in Table 8 and Table 10 in the Appendix . 4 . 2 Cognitive dimension and impact This subsection examines the relationship between the team’s cognitive dimension and impact measures . To this end , we report the results of an OLS to identify the joint impact of authors’ intra - diversity and inter - diversity on the indicators . The outcomes of these models are presented in 5 and 6 . Our analysis emphasises the need to differentiate the forms of impact to understand better how the cognitive aspect influences scientific recognition . Indeed , we use the traditional indicator of the number of citations and indicators of disruption and consolidation . The composition of the teams has a significant influence on the type of impact of the studies conducted . The Table 5 regression tables indicate a double inverse U - shaped relationship between the cog - nitive dimension and the number of citations . Table 13 shows that both turning points are around 45 % . Following Uzzi , a too - conventional work might not be as impactful as the contribution is more 6 Table 17 provided in the Appendix shows that the results are similar when considering un - normalized indicators 22 Table 4 : Faculty Opinions : cognitive diversity and average exploratory profile , highly exploratory and exploitative profile ( Field - Weighted ) Dependent variable : Novelty Perceived ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ( 3 ) ( 4 ) ( 5 ) Author inter abs ( FW ) 0 . 306 ∗∗ 0 . 715 ∗ 0 . 330 ( 0 . 126 ) ( 0 . 388 ) ( 0 . 302 ) Author intra abs ( FW ) - 0 . 532 ∗∗∗ - 0 . 196 ( 0 . 155 ) ( 0 . 419 ) Author inter abs ˆ2 ( FW ) - 0 . 438 - 0 . 270 ( 0 . 376 ) ( 0 . 325 ) Author intra abs ˆ2 ( FW ) - 0 . 364 ( 0 . 379 ) Share exploratory - 0 . 675 ∗∗ - 1 . 233 ∗∗∗ - 1 . 238 ∗∗∗ ( 0 . 275 ) ( 0 . 371 ) ( 0 . 384 ) Share exploitative 0 . 339 ∗∗∗ 0 . 317 ∗∗∗ 0 . 337 ∗∗∗ ( 0 . 117 ) ( 0 . 118 ) ( 0 . 115 ) Share exploratory * Share exploitative 2 . 360 ∗∗ 2 . 289 ∗∗ ( 1 . 052 ) ( 1 . 062 ) Control variables YES YES YES YES YES Observations 12 , 555 12 , 555 12 , 555 12 , 555 12 , 555 Log Likelihood - 7 , 076 . 944 - 7 , 073 . 965 - 7 , 072 . 608 - 7 , 070 . 408 - 7 , 069 . 551 AIC 14 , 423 . 890 14 , 421 . 930 14 , 415 . 220 14 , 412 . 820 14 , 415 . 100 Notes : This table reports coefficients of the effect of cognitive diversity , average exploratory profile , highly exploratory and exploitative profiles on perceived novelty from Faculty Opinions .

Conversely , peers may not sufficiently consider a too - novel study . This phenomenon is reflected in the composition of the teams as we can see in the differences between consolidation and disruption indicators . Indeed , to consolidate , it is necessary to have a team with a low average ex - ploratory profile and low average cognitive distance between members . The relationship is negative for consolidation indicators ( DeIn and Depth ) for both intra and inter - individual levels ; the effect is sometimes captured via quadratic terms . This means that cognitive diversity is negatively related to the fact that papers citing the focal paper also cite each other or cite many of the references from the focal article . Specialized teams are the ones who consolidate the science . For disruptive indicators , the picture is rather different ( DI1 , DI5 , DI1nok and Breadth ) . Cog - nitive distance still seems to be globally favorable for disruption . Then , the Breadth disruption indicator , which examines how often articles citing the focal paper also cite each other , seems to indicate a U - shaped relationship with a turning point at 0 . 33 , i . e . if the individuals are very distant or if they are very close , this produces the most disruptive articles in the sense that the citations 23 Table 5 : Scientific recognition : cognitive diversity and average exploratory profile ( Field - Weighted ) Dependent variable : # cit .

Although not always significant , the intra - individual effect is more mixed ; teams with higher average exploratory profiles globally appear to have a higher disruption potential , but this does not hold for DI1 . The DI1NOK index follows the same pattern as DI5 , with the exception that it is the quadratic term that takes over . The articles that are consolidating science are articles with low team diversity and low average exploratory profiles . Here we can observe the notion of highly specialized individuals who conduct more confirmatory and therefore consolidating research . The opposite is true for disruption . The teams’ diversity always seems beneficial for proposing disruptive ideas . Articles receiving the most citation are again a matter of a trade - off between a cognitively not - too - distant team and a somewhat reasonable average level of exploration 7 . In Table 6 , we specify the team’s composition in terms of exploratory / exploitative profile and 7 For regressions without field - year normalization as presented in Table 16 , the results are more mixed and less clear . The cognitive aspect seems to follow a U - shaped pattern , with teams that are very close or distant being the most disruptive . The results are more robust for breadth , with diversity consistently appearing to be beneficial . 24 found that the relationship of the cognitive distance with the impact measures remains almost similar . For consolidation metrics and citation counts , the share of exploitative individuals is clearly beneficial . The exploitative profile reduces the risk of failure as researchers learn from experience and combinations that have failed [ Vincenti , 1990 ] . Whereas too exploratory profiles seem to affect the expected number of citations negatively , the effect appears mixed for consolidation since it is positive DeIn and insignificant for Depth . In both cases , combining the two types of profiles is harmful . At the same time , the share of exploitative individuals is positive , suggesting that combining these two types of profiles is not optimal for consolidating research . To achieve disruption , it is better to minimize the number of individuals who are too exploratory or too specialized , but combining both types of profiles seems once again essential . We can see how the impact of highly exploratory profiles is always negative , and the impact of exploitative profiles is also negative . Still , the interaction between the two is always positive for all disruptiveness measures .

In conclusion , the analysis shows how teams with a high share of specialized individuals or low average exploratory profiles are teams that consolidate science . In contrast , teams that get the most recognition in terms of disruption combine highly exploitative and highly exploratory individuals 25 and have cognitively more distant members 8 . 5 Conclusion This paper examines the effect of exploratory scholars and , in a broader way , team composition on creativity . Our findings suggest that the cognitive dimension plays a crucial role in the creative process , and significantly influences the two pillars of creativity : originality and success . We first show that the team’s cognitive diversity strongly influences novelty ( realized and perceived ) of the research conducted . We also show that a double - inversed U - shaped relationship exists between cognitive dimensions ( intra and inter ) and the impact in terms of citations . Our study also highlights the strong connection between the cognitive dimension and the nature of these citations . Teams with more exploitative profiles tend to consolidate science , while those with more exploratory individuals disrupt it and propose more distant knowledge combinations , only when associated with exploitative ones . Our research underscores how team composition in terms of profiles lies at the heart of scientific creativity . Multiple limitations arise in our study . First , concerning data used , PKG is based on advanced heuristics and algorithms to disambiguate authors using affiliation and additional metadata Xu et al . [ 2020 ] . While there is a considerable amount of research on addressing noise in Knowledge Graphs [ Fasoulis et al . , 2020 ] and improvements in these methods may increase their reliability in the future , we cannot guarantee that errors or inconsistencies will not occur when dealing with author - level information in PKG . Other shortcomings are directly related to the creation of our indicator . First , many methods and hyper - parameters were chosen for the simplicity of computation . The embedding is a pre - trained model from SpaCy and is not state - of - the - art . One should compare the behavior of different embedding techniques but also on what kind of text they are applied and the distance measure used . We suspect that the two papers might be close given a specific embedding and distance measure but highly distant given other parameters . In addition , the distance between the two papers would vary depending on whether the distance metric is applied to the paper’s title , abstract , or full text . The semantic distances between researchers can be influenced by biases inherent in the fields and journal practices . For example , if researchers publish in different journals , the structure and format of their abstracts may be affected even if their research topic or area of expertise remains unchanged . Another hyper - parameter we used is the time window for an author’s past publication . We considered a time window of 5 years . This suggests that any paper published by the author before this point would not be captured . One could argue that past behavior influences current behavior , and a highly diverse background can be proxied by recent publications . Yet no evidence supports this hypothesis . Another issue is how we define authors’ cognitive aspect by considering only past publications . Although we do not try to approximate the skills of a researcher but only their disposition to do diverse research , we are not sure how working on a topic is enough to understand then and manage this new knowledge . This raises the question of the exact competencies of a transformational leader and if the past paper is sufficient to proxy it . Also , a specialized author 8 For regressions without field - year normalization ( see Table 19 ) , the results are less homogeneous for the cognitive distance aspect , but the combination of exploratory and exploitative is robust . The interaction of the two consistently leads to disruption . 26 could have previously worked on distant papers but only on his topic / methodology . Our measure defines it as diverse , yet is it true ? Although solo publications can be used to construct an author’s profile , the increasing significance of teamwork in scientific research makes it uncertain whether a complete and precise profile can be established solely on this basis . Another option could be to incorporate external information , such as educational background , and assign greater weight to papers that align with the author’s education . However , obtaining this information can be challenging as it often requires web scraping , which is not easily scalable . The last issue in our mind about using past publications is ghost and honorary authorship as it is common that some authors contributed very little to the production of the article . [ Sugimoto and Larivi ` ere , 2018 , Pruschak and Hopp , 2022 ] . Both are problems to consider while defining a coauthored paper as part of your knowledge space . In our analysis , we solely focused on the cognitive diversity of researchers , but diversity en - compasses various aspects as highlighted by prior research studies [ Medin and Lee , 2012 , Hofstra et al . , 2020 ] . According to Koopmann et al . [ 2021 ] , there are four proximity dimensions among researchers , namely cognitive , institutional , social , and geographical . Relying solely on PKG to ap - proximate all of these dimensions could be challenging . Still , alternative sources such as OpenAlex could provide more comprehensive information on a researcher’s institutions , past institutions , and authors’ characteristics . For instance , relying on PKG to construct a researcher’s seniority could be biased because of the restriction on health sciences papers . Exploring these additional channels could lead to developing supplementary measures that complement cognitive diversity . Another area worth exploring is the temporal dynamic between exploring new ideas and ex - ploiting existing ones . As we discussed earlier , discovering new concepts is essential for addressing major challenges . However , there is often a pattern of moving through cycles of exploration and exploitation within a particular field . Similarly , authors may initially focus on a particular subject and then switch to a different area to gain a fresh perspective on the first one once they have developed sufficient expertise . To increase the efficiency of the scientific system , it is necessary to conduct further research on the composition of research teams and their impact on creativity . Our preliminary results indicate that policymakers and grant evaluators should consider both individual and team - level characteristics and not only success or originality when making decisions about research funding and support . We have explored some research avenues to deepen our understanding of this phenomenon , and we encourage other researchers to build upon our work in this area . By continuing to investigate these factors , we can develop more effective strategies for supporting and fostering creativity within research teams , ultimately leading to more impactful and innovative scientific outcomes .
