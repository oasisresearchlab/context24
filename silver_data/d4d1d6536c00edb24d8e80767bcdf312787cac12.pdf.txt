The ERM family members , ezrin , radixin , and moesin , localizing just beneath the plasma mem - branes , are thought to be involved in the actin ilia - merit / plasma membrane association . To identify the in - tegral membrane protein directly associated with ERM family members , we performed immunoprecipitation studies using antimoesin mAb and cultured baby ham - ster kidney ( BHK ) cells metabolically labeled with 35Smethionine or surface - labeled with biotin . The results indicated that moesin is directly associated with a 140 - kD integral membrane protein . Using BHK cells as antigens , we obtained a mAb that recognized the 140 - kD membrane protein . We next cloned a cDNA encoding the 140 - kD membrane protein and identified it as CD44 , a broadly distributed cell sur - face glycoprotein . Immunoprecipitation with various anti - CIM4 mAbs showed that ezrin and radixin , as well as moesin , are associated with CIM4 , not only in BHK cells , but also in mouse L fibroblasts . Further - more , immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that in both BHK and L cells , the Triton X - 100 - insoluble CIM4 is precisely colocalized with ERM family mem - bers . We concluded that ERM family members work as molecular linkers between the cytoplasmic domain of CIM4 and actin - based cytoskeletons . T HE ERM family consists of three closely related pro - teins ; ezrin , radixin , and moesin ( Sato et al . , 1992 ; Tsukita et al . , 1992 ) . These proteins were identified independently in various tissues and ceils : ezrin as a constit - uent of microviUi ( Bretscher , 1983 ; Pakkanen et al . , 1987 ) and as a good substrate for tyrosine kinases in vivo ( Bretscher , 1989 ; Gould et al . , 1986 ; Hunter and Cooper , 1981 , 1983 ) ; radixin as a barbed end - capping actin - modulating protein in cell - to - cell adherens junctions ( Tsu - kita et al . , 1989 ) and moesin as a heparin binding protein ( Lankes et al . , 1988 ) . Sequence analyses of their cDNAs re - vealed that these three proteins are highly homologous ( ' ~ 75 % identity ) ( Gould et al . , 1989 ; Turunen et al . , 1989 ; Funayama et al . , 1991 ; Lankes and Furthmayr , 1991 ; Sato et al . , 1992 ) . Although the distribution of these proteins in - side cells has so far been intensively analyzed using various combinations of antibodies and cells , the results have not been consistent ( Bretscher , 1983 ; Pakkanen et al . , 1987 ; Tsukita et al . , 1989 ; Sato et al . , 1991 , 1992 ; Lankes et al . , 1988 ; Berryman et al . , 1993 ; Franck et al . , 1993 ) . Address all correspondence to Sachiko Tsuldta , College of Medical T ~ h - nolosy , Kyoto University , Kawahara - cho , Shogoin , Sakyo - ku , Kyoto 606 , Japan . We revealed that these closely related proteins are colo - calized just beneath the plasma membranes at microvilli , ruffling membranes , cleavage furrows and adherens junc - tions ( Sato et al . , 1992 ) , although their presence at adherens junctions was claimed to require reevaluation , especially in tissues in vivo ( Berryman et al . , 1993 ; Franck et al . , 1993 ) . These sites are specialized regions where actin filaments are densely associated with plasma membranes . Furthermore , Sagara , J . , Sa . Tsukita , S . Yonemura , Sh . Tsukita , and A . Kawai ( manuscript submitted for publication ) have found that during the budding process of enveloped , neg - ative - stranded RNA viruses such as the rabies virus , ac - tin and ERM family members of host cells are selectively in - corporated into virions . Therefore , we proposed that ERM family members are directly involved in the molecular mech - anism of the actin filament - plasma membrane interaction in general ( Sato et al . , 1992 ; Tsukita et al . , 1992 ) . Recent experiments with antisense oligonucleotide com - plementary to ERM sequences revealed that ERM family members play crucial roles at least in cell - cell and cell - sub - strate adhesion and microvilli formation probably through the regulation of actin filament - plasma membrane interac - tions ( Takeuchi et al . , 1994 ) . Furthermore , the tumor sup - pressor gene of neurofibromatosis 2 has been identified ( Tro - fatter et al . , 1993 ; Rouleau et al . , 1993 ) , and its gene product © The Rockefeller University Press , 0021 - 9525 / 94 / 07 / 391 / 11 $ 2 . 00 The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 126 , Number 2 , July 1994 391 - 401 391 was very similar in amino acid sequence to the ERM family members ( ~ 49 % identity ) . This product was named merlin ( moesin - ezrin - radixin - like protein ) . This suggests that like merlin , ERM family members are involved in the regulation mechanism of cell growth . Therefore , ERM family members are now attracting increasing interest among cell biologists studying not only actin filaments , but also cell adhesion and cell growth . The sequence of the NH2 - terminal half of the ERM fam - ily is highly conserved ( , v85 % identity for any pair ) ( Sato et al . , 1992 ) . This sequence was also found in the NH2 - terminal half of the band 4 . 1 protein ( Comboy et al . , 1986 ) , one of the major accessory proteins of erythrocyte mem - branes that is associated with spectrin and actin in membrane skeletons ( Bennett , 1989 ) . The NH2 - terminai half of this protein is responsible for its specific binding to glycophorin C ( also called glycoconnectin ) , a major integral membrane protein in erythrocytes ( Anderson and Lovrein , 1984 ; An - derson and Marchesi , 1985 , Leto et al . , 1986 ) . These findings led to the speculation that ERM family members are also directly associated with a single class of integral mem - brane protein at their NH2 - terminal half . Therefore , to fur - ther understand the physiological functions of ERM family members , this putative integral membrane protein must be identified . In this study , we immunoprecipitated moesin with an anti moesin mAb from the lysate of cultured baby hamster kidney ( BHK ) t cells , and found that one membrane protein with an apparent molecular mass of 140 kD was coimmunoprecipi - rated . Taking advantage of rabies virions that had been ex - pected to contain the putative ElLM - binding membrane pro - tein ( Sagara et al . , manuscript submitted for publication ) , an mAb that recognized the 140 kD membrane protein was ob - tained . We then cloned the cDNA encoding this membrane protein . Sequence analyses of the cDNA revealed that this protein is a broadly distributed cell surface glycoprotein CD44 ( reviewed in Haynes et al . , 1989 , 1991 ; Lesley et al . , 1993 ) , which is also called Pgprl ( Zhou et ai . , 1989 ) , HCAM ( Goldstein et al . , 1989 ) , Hermes antigen ( Jalkanen et al . , 1986 ) , and ECMRHI ( Wayner et ai . , 1988 ) . We fur - ther found with various anti - CD44 mAbs that ezrin and radixin , as well as moesin , were coimmunoprecipitated with CD44 , not only in BHK cells , but also in mouse L fibro - blasts . Furthermore , both in BHK and L cells , the Triton X - 100 - insoluble CD44 was precisely colocalized with ERM family members . Therefore , we concluded that ERM fam - ily members work as molecular linkers between CD44 and actin - based cytoskeletons . We believe this study will help provide a better understanding of the physiological func - tions , not only of ERM family members , but also of the cell surface glycoprotein CD44 . Materials and Methods Cells , Virions , and Antibodies BHK cells were grown in DME supplemented with 5 % newborn calf serum and 10 % tryptose phosphate broth . L cells were maintained in DME sup - plemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum . 1 .

Rabies virions were purified by a combination of polyethylene glycol precipitation and sucrose density gradient centrifugation , as previously de - scribed ( Sagara et al . , 1992 ) . The mouse mAb CR - 22 ( Sato et al . , 1991 ) reacts specifically with mue - sin in immunoprecipitation and all ERM family members in immunoblot - ring with a bias to moesin . To detect all ERM family members by immuno - blotting , we used a mixture of CR - 22 and rabbit anti - ERM pAb 11 , which detects all ERM family members with a bias to ezrin and radixin ( Seto et al . , 1992 ) . IM7 . & I . is a rat anti - mouse CD44 mAb ( Trowbridge et al . , 1982 ) . Production of mAbs against Surface Antigens of BHK Cells Cultured BHK cells were washed with PBS , detached from dishes with PBS containing 0 . 5 mM EDTA , collected by centrifngation , and suspended in PBS . Monoclonal antibodies were raised against the cell surface antigens of these BHK cells in rats . Hybridomas were prepared by fusion between rat lymphocytes and mouse P3 myeloma cells , essentially by the method previously described ( Tsukita et al . , 1989 ) . The culture supernatant of each hybridoma was assayed for antibody production by immunoblotting using purified rabies virions . Labeling of Cellular Proteins To metabolically label BHK cells with 35Smethionine at 80 - 90 % conflu - ence , cells were grown as monolayers in plastic dishes I00 mm in diameter . The monolayers were washed once with methionine - free medium sup - plemented with 2 % fetal calf serum , followed by a 3 - h incubation in 3 ml of the same medium containing 0 . 1 mCi 35Smethionine ( Amersham Corp . , Arlington Heights , IL ) . After three washes with PBS , the cells were processed for immunoprecipitation . To surface label BHK cells with biotin , cells were grown on plastic dishes 100 or 180 mm in diameter . At ~ 70 % confluence , the cells were washed with 0 . 1 M Hepes buffer ( pH 8 . 0 ) containing 50 mM NaC1 , and were in - cubated for 15 rain at room temperature with 2 ( 100 - ram dish ) or 5 mi ( 180 - nun dish ) of 0 . 1 M Hepes buffer ( pH 8 . 0 ) containing 1 mg / mi sulfosuc - cinimidobiotin ( sulfo - NHS - biotin ) ( Pierce Chemical Co . , Rockford , IL ) , 50 mM NaCI , 1 mM p - amidinoPMSF , and 10 ~ tg / ml leupeptin . Cells were washed with DME followed by PBS , and were processed for immunoprecip - Ration . Immunoprecipitation The labeled cells on one dish were lysed and incubated in 0 . 4 - - 0 . 8 ml of RIPA buffer ( 0 . 1 % SDS , 0 . 5 % deoxycboiate , 1 % Nonidet P - 40 , 150 mM NaCI , 50 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 1 mM p - amidinoPMSF , and 10 / ~ g / mi leupep - tin ) for 5 rain . The RIPA lysete was removed from the dish after fully dis - lodging any remaining cellular debris from the plate surfiw . e with a rubber policeman . The lysate from one dish was incubated in a 1 . 5 - ml tube on ice for an additional 10 min , and was then clarified by centrifugation at 12 , 000 g for 15 min . The RIPA - soinble supernatunt was immunoprecipi - tared with 20 / d of protein G - Sepharose 4B ( Pharmacia LKB Biotechnol - ogy AB , Uppsela , Sweden , or Zymed Laboratories , Inc . , South San Fran - cisco , CA ) conjugated with monoclunal antibodies or control mouse / rat IgG . Sepharose 4B - bound immune complezes ware washed five times with RIPA buffer . Immune complexes were then eluted by boiling in sample buffer for SDS - PAGE , and resolved by SDS - PAGE . The biofinylated pro * teins were visualized as described below , and the 35Smethionine signal was analyzed ( Fojix Biolm ~ ge Analyzer Bas 2000 System ; Fuji Film Co . Ltd . , Tokyo ) . For reimmunoprecipitation , the immune complexes were eluted from 20 ~ , 1 of Sepharose 4B - bound in a 1 . 5 - mi test tube with 50 / d of a high salt solution consisting of 0 . 98 M KCI , 0 . 02 M NaCI , 1 mM MgCI2 , 10 mM MOPS ( pH 7 . 4 ) . The eluetes from five tubes were combined and diluted with 6 vol of distilled water , then reimmunoprecipitated with 20 p . l of pro - rein G - Sepharose 4B conjugated with monoclonal antibodies or control rat IgG . After washing five times with the high salt solution diluted with 6 vol of distilled water , immune complexes were eluted and analyzed as described above . Construction of a k gtll cDNA Expression Library and Immunoscreening The poly ( A ) + RNA was isolated from BHK cells as described by Sam - The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 126 , 1994 392 brook et al . ( 1989 ) . The eDNA synthesis was primed with oligo ( dT ) , using a cDNA synthesis kit ( TimeSaver ; Pharmacia LKB Bioteclmology AB , Uppsala , Sweden ) . After ligation with EcoRI / NotI adaptors , the blunt - ended eDNA was ligated into a k gtll vector with dephosphorylated EcoRI overhanging ends . The clones were immunosereened using the mAb 30189 as described pre - viously ( Fonayama et al . , 1991 ) . One eDNA clone 0310 ) was isolated , and its insert was subcloned into pBlueseript SK ( - ) and sequenced with a Taq terminator cycle sequencing kit ( DyeDeoxy ' ; Applied Biosystems , Inc . , Foster City , CA ) . Production of Fusion Proteins The 5 " fragment , B10b , was prepared from B10 by digestion with EcoRI ( see Fig . 4 A ) . This fragment carried EcoRI sites at both ends , by means of which it was cloned directly into pGEX . The results construct encoded a fusion protein of (cid:127)40 kD . Two other eDNA fragments , B10a and B10c , were synthesized from B10 by means of PeR ( see Fig . 4 A ) . Bl0a with EcoRI sites at both ends , and Bloc with BamHI and EcoRI sites at 5 ' and 3 ' ends , respectively , were cloned directly into pGEX and the resulting respective constructs encoded fusion proteins of , ' ~ 30 and , ' ~ 38 kD . 300 / ~ g B10b fusion protein was purified electropboretically and used as an antigen to produce mAbs in rats . Gel Electrophoresis , Immunoblotting , and Detection of Biotinylated Protbins One - dimensional SDS - PAGE ( 7 . 5 - 15 % ) was based on the method of Laernmli ( 1970 ) , and the gels were stained with Coornassie brilliant blue R - 250 . After electrophoresis , proteins were electrophorefically transferred from gels to nitrocellulose membranes , which were then incubated with the first antibody , which was detected with a blotting detection kit ( Amersham Corp . ) . To detect biotinylated proteins , the nitrocellulose membranes were soaked for 1 h in TBS containing 5 % skim milk , followed by a 60 - rain incu - bation with avidin alkaline phosphatase . After washing in TBS , biotinylated proteins were visualized using a blotting detection kit ( Amersham Corp . ) . Immunofluorescence Microscopy Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy was performed as described pre - viously ( Itoh et al . , 1991 ) . Cultured BHK and L cells extracted or not with Triton X - 100 were fixed in 3 % formalin for 10 rain . The second antibody was FITC - conjngated goat anti - rat IgG ( Tago Inc . , Burlingame , CA ) , rhodamine - conjugated goat anti - mouse lgG ( Chemicon , Inc . , Temecula , CA ) , or rhodamine - eonjugated donkey anti - rabbit IgG ( Chemicon , Inc . ) . Samples were examined using a fluorescence microscope ( Axiopboto photo - microscope ; Carl Zeiss , Inc . , Thornwood , NY ) . Extraction of CD44 with Various Concentrations of Triton X - 100 BHK or surface - biotinylated BHK ceUs were extracted with 0 . 1 , 0 . 4 , or 1 . 0 % Triton X - 100 in the solution containing 150 mM NaCI , 1 mM MgC12 , 1 m . M CaC12 , 15 mM Tris ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 1 mM p - amidinoPMSF , and 10 ~ g / mi leupeptin for 10 rain at 4 " C . The Triton X - 100 ly ~ te was removed from the dish after fully dislodging any remaining cellular debris from the dish surface with a rubber policeman . The lysate was separated into soluble and insoluble fractions by centrifngation at 12 , 000 g for 15 min . Results Identification of a Membrane Protein Directly Associated with Moesin in BHK Cells Immunoprecipitation was performed using the mAb CR - 22 that preferentially recognizes moesin . In a preliminary study , a variety of cell types and detergent conditions were tested to identify the proteins that coimmunoprecipitate with moesin . A combination of BHK cells and RIPA buffer ( see Materials and Methods ) was the most appropriate : the same results were obtained from other types of cells , such as mouse fibroblasts ( L cells ) and epithelial cells ( MTD - 1A cells ) , but the yield of the immunoprecipitates was sig - nificantly larger from BHK ceils . When BHK ceils were metabolically labeled with [ 3sS ] methionine , lysed , solubi - lized with RIPA buffer , and immunoprecipitated with mAb CR - 22 , a broad band around 140 kD was detected in addition to the moesin band by immunoprecipitation ( Fig . 1 A ) . When immunoprecipitates were washed in RIPA buffer , the association remained intact , but the addition of 1 % SDS to the wash eliminated the 140 kD protein , indicating that it was not recognized by mAb CR - 22 and was directly associated with moesin in a noncovalent manner . To determine whether or not this 140 - kD protein was a membrane protein , the cell surface proteins of BHK cells were labeled with biotin , lysed , solubilized , and immuno - precipitated with mAb CR - 22 under the same conditions as described above . In immunoprecipitates containing moesin , a biotin - labeled band was detected around 140 kD ( Fig . 1 B , lanes 3 and 3 ' ) . Less intense bands at 85 and 80 kD were also detected . The intensity of the 85 - kD band varied among ex - periments , whereas that of the 80 - kD band increased with time after immunoprecipitation , suggesting that at least the 80 - kD band is a degradation product of the 140 - kD band . In the presence of 1 % SDS , the 140 - kD membrane protein was not coimmunoprecipitated with moesin ( Fig . 1 B , lanes 4 and Figure 1 .

BHK cells were metabolically labeled with [ 35S ] methionine , lysed , solubilized with RIPA buffer , and immunoprecipitated with normal mouse IgG ( lane 1 ) or antimoesin mAb , CR - 22 ( lane 2 ) . The [ 35S ] methionine signal was detected by a Fujix Bioimage Analyzer . ( B ) Coim - munoprecipitation of a surface - labeled 140 - kD protein ( * ) with moesin . Cell - surface proteins of BHK ceils were labeled with bio - tin , lysed , and solubilized with RIPA buffer ( lanes 1 and 1 ' ) . This sample was immtmoprecipitated with normal mouse IgG ( lanes 2 and 2 ' ) or with mAb CR - 22 ( lanes 3 and 39 . In some experiments , surface - labeled cells were solubilized with the buffer containing 1 % SDS , and then immunoprecipitated with mAb CR - 22 ( lane 4 and 4 ' ) . After samples were separated in SDS - PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes , the biotinylated proteins were detected by means of the avidin - aikaline phusphatase system ( lanes 1 - 4 ) , and ezrin ( E ) / radixin ( R ) / moesin ( M ) were detected by immuno - blotting with a mixture of pAb I1 and CR - 22 ( lanes 1 ' - 4 ' ) . In lane 3 , in addition to the 140 - kD biotinylated protein , lower levels of 85 ( arrowhead ) and 80 kD ( arrow ) proteins also coimmunoprecipi - tared with moesin . Tsukita et al .

Isolation and Sequencing of cDNA Encoding the ERM - associated Membrane Protein Using the mAb30189 , we screened , ol x 105 plaques from an oligo ( dT ) - primed X gtl 1 cDNA library made from BHK cells , cloned one positive phage recombinant , B10 ( , o950 4 ' ) . These findings led us to conclude that moesin was directly associated with a 140 - kD membrane protein that was specifically trapped by WGA and Con A columns , indi - cating that it is glycosylated ( data not shown ) . Production of Monoclonal Antibodies Specific for the 140 - kD Membrane Protein Because of the small amount of immunoprecipitates , they could not be used as antigens to raise mAbs that recognize the 140 - kD moesin - associated membrane protein . ( Sagara , J . , Sa . Tsukita , S . Yonemura , Sh . Tsukita , and A . Kawai , manuscript submitted for publication ) have found that dur - ing the budding of enveloped , negative - stranded RNA vi - ruses such as the rabies virus , actin and ERM proteins of host cells are selectively incorporated into virions , suggest - ing that the 140 - kD moesin - associated membrane protein is also concentrated in these virions . Actually , SDS - PAGE of rabies virions produced in BI - IK cells revealed a host cell - derived faint band around 140 kD . Therefore , using living BHK cells as an antigen , we raised many mAbs in rats that recognize the cell - surface antigens , and we selected one ( mAb30189 ) that faintly recognized a band at , o140 kD in rabies virions by immunoblotting . This mAb recognized the 140 - kD membrane protein in the moesin immunoprecipitates both from metabolically and surface - biotinylated BHK cells ( Fig . 2 , A and B ) . This confirmed that the metabolically labeled 140 - kD band is identical to the biotinylated 140 - kD protein . The 85 - kD membrane protein that was also present at low levels in the moesin immunoprecipitates from biotin - labeled cells ( Fig . 1 B , lane 3 , arrowhead ) was also recognized by this mAb , sug - gesting that it is an isoform of the 140 - kD protein ( Fig . 2 B , lane 3 , arrow ) . Furthermore , when BHK cells were lysed , solubilized with RIPA buffer , and immunoprecipitated with this mAb , immunoblotting revealed the presence of not only moesin , but also ezrin and radixin ( Fig . 3 ) . Therefore , we concluded that this mAb recognizes the 140 - kD membrane A Eco ~ B 10a 27 _ 4 . . _ _ . _ [ ~ 4 BlOb ~ 75 B10c ~ 43 . . - ? : o Figure 4 .

Deduced amino acid sequence encoded by the 5 ' - half ( 339 bp ) of 1310 ( / arge asterisks ) and the correspond - ing sequences of mouse v9 / vl0 containing CD44 ( CD4 ~ ) and hamster stan - dard type CD44 ( CD44s ) . In the hamster , only the eDNA encoding the standard type has been sequenced so far ( Arutfo et al . , 1990 ) . There - fore , we also compared the amino acid sequence of mouse v9 / vl0 containins CD44 , which contained exons v9 and vl0 ( T61g et al . , 1993 ) . Iden - tity and homology are indi - cated by asterisks and dots , respectively . bp ) , then sequenced 339 bp of B10 from its 5 ' end . From B10 , two eDNA fragments , B10a ( 111 bp ) and B10b ( 275 bp ) , were prepared , and fusion proteins were generated in F ~ cherichia coli from B10a and B10b ( Fig . 4 A ) . Immunoprecipitation re - vealed that mAb30189 recognized B10a hut not B10b fusion proteins ( Fig . 4 B ) . We then raised mAbs in the rat using the B10b fusion protein as an antigen , and obtained one mAb ( mAb c0 that specifically recognized only B10b fusion pro - teins ( Fig . 4 B ) , indicating that the epitope for mAb o ~ is dis - tinct from that for the original mAb30189 . As shown in Fig . 4 C , this mAba specifically bound to the 140 - kD ERM - associated protein in the moesin immunoprecipitates from the biotin - labeled BHK cells as mAb30189 did . This strongly suggests that the eDNA clone B10 encodes the 140 - kD ERM - associated membrane protein . The amino acid sequence deduced from the 339 bp of B10 from its 5 ' end indicated that B10 encodes CD44 , a broadly - distributed cell surface glycoprotein ( Fig . 5 ) . It is now widely accepted that the great variety of CD44 isoforms are generated by alternative splicing from a single gene ( for a re - view see , Lesley et al . , 1993 ) . These isoforms contain vari - ous kinds of inserts at the membrane - proximal domain of the extracellular portion as a result of alternative splicing ; the isoform without any insertion is called a " standard " type . In the hamster , only the eDNA encoding the standard type has so far been sequenced . As shown in Fig . 5 , among 113 se - quenced amino acids , the sequence of 82 - 113a . a . was com - pletely identical to that of a part of the hamster standard type CD44 . The remainder ( 1 - 81a . a . ) was highiy homologous in the amino acid sequence to the insert of mouse v9 / vl0 con - raining CD44 . Therefore , we concluded that B10 encodes a hamster v9 / vl0 containing CD44 . These data appear to indicate that the 140kD ERM - associated protein is an isoform of CD44 containing at least v9 / vl0 . However , the possibility that it is a standard type CD44 has not been completely excluded because it is still possible that the mAbo ~ epitope resides within amino acid residues 82 - 91 ( see Figs . 4 A and 5 ) . Therefore , to check whether or not the mAbo ~ epitope is located within residues 1 - 81 ( exons v9 and vl0 ) , we generated a fusion protein cor - responding to this domain using B10c ( see Fig . 4 A ) . As shown in Fig . 4 , B and C , mAba bound to this fusion pro - tein , indicating that it recognizes the insert derived from exons v9 or vl0 . This mAba recognized the 140 - kD ERM - associated protein both by immunoprecipitation ( Fig . 4 C ) and immunoblotting ( see Fig . 10 A , lane 3 ) , indicating that the 140 - kD ERM - associated membrane protein is an iso - form of CD44 that contained inserts at least derived from exons v9 and / or vl0 . Colocalization of ERM Family Members and CD44 in Hamster and Mouse Cells The structure and function of CD44 and the ERM family have been analyzed so far mainly in mice and humans ( Les - Icy et al . , 1993 ; Tsukita et al . , 1992 ) . Therefore , using an anti - mouse CD44 mAb , IM7 . 8 . 1 , which recognizes all types of mouse CD44 , mouse L fibroblasts were lysed , solubi - lized , and immunoprecipitated . As shown in Fig . 6 , immu - noblotting with a mixture ofpAb I1 and mAb CR22 revealed that the CD44 immunoprecipitates contained ezrin , radixin , and moesin , indicating that CD44 is also associated with the ERM family in mouse L cells . Next , using BHK cells and L fibroblasts , the localization Figure 6 . Coimmunoprecipita - tion of ezrin / radixin / moesin with CD44 in mouse L fibroblasts . L cells were lysed and solubilized with RIPA buffer ( lane 1 ) . This sample was immunoprecipitated with normal rat IgG ( lane 2 ) or with rat anti - mouse CD44 mAb , IM 7 . 8 . 1 ( lane 3 ) .

Bar , 10 # m . of ERM family members were compared to that of CD44 . When these cells were fixed and immunofluorescently stained with anti - CD44 mAb without detergent extraction , in addition to the weak diffuse staining on the cell surface , microvilli and cell - cell adhesion sites were intensely stained ( Fig . 7 ) . In sharp contrast , when cells were treated with 0 . 1 - 1 % Triton X - 100 before ( data not shown ) or after formal - dehyde fixation ( Figs . 8 and 9 ) , the weak diffuse staining completely disappeared leaving intense staining on micro - villi and cell - cell adhesion sites . A close comparison of Triton X - 100 - treated cells by double immunofluorescence microscopy using anti - CIM4 mAb and anti - ERM pAb I1 re - vealed that the distribution of the Triton X - 100 - insoluble CD44 completely coincided with that of ERM family mem - bers ( Fig . 8 , A - D , Fig . 9 , A and B ) . In dividing cells , CD44 was highly concentrated at cleavage furrows together with ERM family members ( Figs . 8 , E - G and 9 , C - E ) . The 85 - and 140 - kD CD44 and their Cytoskeleton Association When the biotin - labeled BHK cells were lysed , solubilized , and immunoprecipitated with mAb30189 , in addition to some minor bands 050 - 170 kD ) , two major bands around 140 and 85 kD were detected , and the expression level of the latter was much higher than that of the former ( Fig . 10 A , lanes 2 ) . Since only the 140 - kD band was recognized by mAb ~ ( Fig . 10 A , lane 3 ) , and since BHK cells were re - ported to express a large amount of the standard type CD44 ( Lesley et al . , 1993 ) , it is likely that the 85 - and 140 - kD CD44 correspond to the standard type and the isoform con - taining at least v9 / vl0 , respectively . To examine the association of these isoforms with cytoskeletons , we analyzed the degree of extraction of each from BHK cells with various concentrations of Triton X - 100 ( Fig . 10 B ) . Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation re - vealed that with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 , both the 85 - and the 140 - kD CD44 were associated with cytoskeletons , that with 0 . 4 - 1 . 0 % Triton X - 100 , most of the 85 - kD standard - type CD44 was extracted ( Fig . 10 B , lane 2 ) , and that the 140 - kD CD44 was hardly extracted , even in the presence of 1 . 0 % Triton X - 100 ( Fig . 10 B , lane / ) . These findings indicate that the 140 - kD CD44 binds to cytoskeletons more tightly than the 85 - kD CD44 . Discussion Actin filaments are involved in many kinds of cellular events , and they are found in association with the plasma membrane in a variety of eukaryotic cells ( Pollard and Weihing , 1974 ; Ishikawa , 1979 ) . The ERM family members , ezrin , radixin , and moesin , are thought to play a crucial role just beneath the plasma membrane in the actin filament / plasma mem - brane association in general ( Sato et al . , 1992 ; Tsukita et al . , 1992 ; Berryman et al . , 1993 ) . In this study , we searched for an integral membrane protein that is directly associated with the ERM family . We found that immunoprecipitation re - vealed the direct association of ERM family members with a 140 - kD membrane protein . Further analysis of this protein identified it as CD44 . Taking into consideration that CD44 was precisely colocalized with ERM family members both in BHK and mouse L cells , we concluded that the ERM fam - ily is directly associated with the cytoplasmic domain of CD44 . CD44 is a polymorphic . cell - surface glycoprotein that is found on a wide variety of cells ( Haynes et al . , 1989 , 1991 ; Lesley et al . , 1993 ) . Its exact functions have yet to be conclu - sively defined , although recent reports have implicated CD44 in extracellular matrix binding , cell migration , lym - phopoiesis , and lymphocyte homing in normal cells , as well as in metastasis in cancer cells ( Gfinthert et al . , 1991 . ; Arch et al . , 1992 ; Koopman et al . , 1993 ) . So far , ERM family members were thought to bind to glycophorin C - like mem - brane proteins , since their Nile - terminal half showed a similarity to the glycophorin C - binding domain of the band 4 . 1 protein ( Leto et al . , 1986 ) . In this study , we found direct interaction between CD44 and ERM family members . CIM4 and glycophorin C are both heavily glycosylated pro - teins that once span membranes , but they have no significant sequence homology ( Colin et al . , 1986 ; Haynes et al . , 1989 , 1991 ; Lesley et al . , 1993 ) . CIM4 reportedly interacts with components of actin - based cytoskeletons , and this interaction is required for its function ( Jacobson et al . , 1984 ; Tarone et al . , 1984 ; Lacy and Underhill , 1987 ; Carter and Wayner , 1988 ; Geppert and Lipsky , 1991 ; Camp et al . , 1991 ; Neame and Isacke , 1992 ) . Many investigators have attempted to identify the cytoskele - tal components that directly bind to CD44 . Bourguignon et The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 126 , 1994 396 Figure 8 .

Bar , 10 # m . al . reported that the cytoplasmic domain of CD44 is as - sociated with a 72 - kD ankyrin - like protein ( Bourguignon et ai . , 1986 , 1992 ; Kalomiris and Bourguignon , 1988 ) . They found that the 16S complex isolated from lymphoma plasma membranes was mainly composed of CD44 and ankyrin - like 72 - kD protein , and they further showed that the cytoplasmic domain of CD44 can bind to the " erythrocyte " ankyrin directly in vivo . In the 16S complex , their molar ratio ap - peared to be ~ 1 : 1 . In sharp contrast , the CD44 was coimmu - noprecipitated with moesin , but not with the 72 - kD polypep - tide ( see Fig . 1 B ) ; at least in the immunoprecipitate , no band around 72 kD was detected by immunoblotting with an - tiankyrin antibodies ( data not shown ) . This discrepancy may be attributed to the different extraction conditions : the 16S complex was released from plasma membranes with 1 % Tri - ton X - 100 , whereas the CD44 - ERM complex was obtained using 0 . 1 % SDS and 1 % Nonidet P - 40 . Given that in the ab - sence of SDS , the CD44 molecule that tightly bound to ERM was totally insoluble in Triton X - 100 , the lack of ERM in the 16S complex could be explained . Conversely , if the associa - tion of the ankyrin - like 72 - kD protein with CD44 is not resistant to the SDS treatment , the CD44 - ERM complex would lack the 72 - kD protein . At present , it is not clear whether in vivo CD44 , ERM , and ankyrin - like 72 - kD protein form a single complex ( CD44 / ERM / 72 - kD complex ) or two distinct types of com - plex ( CD44 / ERM and CD44 / ankyrin ) . However , judging from their subeellular distribution , ERM family members may play a central role in connecting CD44 to the underlying cytoskeletons ; ERM family members and CD44 are pre - The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 126 , 1994 398 Figure 10 . Extractability of the 140 - and 85 - kD CIM4 with various concentrations of Triton X - 100 in BHK cells . ( A ) lmmunoprecipi - tates with normal mouse IgG ( lane 1 ) or mAb30189 ( lane 2 ) from the surface - labeled BHK cells . In lane 2 , in addition to some minor bands ( 150 - 170 kD ) , two biotinylated bands corresponding to the isoform of CIM4 containing at least v9 / vl0 ( 140 - kD ) and the standard - type CD44 ( 85kD ) were detected . As shown in lane 3 by immunoblotting , mAba recognizes the 140 - and 80 - kD , but not the 85 - kD CIM4 in BHK cells . The 80 - kD band may be a degradation product from the 140 - kD CD44 . ( B ) In experiment 1 ( lane 1 ) , BHK cells were extracted with various concentrations of Triton X - 100 , and insoluble ( P ) and soluble ( S ) fractions were obtained as described in Materials and Methods . Each fraction was sepa - rated by SDS - PAGE , and the 140 - kD CIM4 was detected by immu - noblotting with mAb , , which recognizes the inserts derived from exon v9 or vl0 included in the 140 - kD CD44 . In experiment 2 ( lane 2 ) , biotinylated BHK cells were extracted with various concentra - tions of Triton X - 100 , and insoluble and soluble fractions were ob - tained . After the insoluble fraction was solubilized with RIPA buffer , the amount of the 85 - kD standard - type CD44 in each frac - tion was evaluated by immunoprecipitation with mAb30189 . cisely colocalized and concentrated at the microvilli and cleavage furrows , while ankyrin is not reportedly concen - trated at these structures . The complete colocalization of ERM and CD44 ( the Triton - insoluble type ) was observed in all types of culture cells we examined ( data not shown ) . One important question concerning the ERM family is whether or not ezrin , radixin , and moesin are associated with the same integral membrane protein . The present data revealed that they are all associated with the cytoplasmic do - main of CD44 molecules . This conclusion is highly consis - tent with our recent data of the distribution of ERM family members ( Takeuchi et al . , 1994 ) : close analyses of the local - ization of each member using antisense oligonucleotide - treated cells revealed that ezrin , radixin , and moesin are all concentrated at specialized regions where actin filaments are densely associated with plasma membranes , and that each protein by itself can concentrate at these regions . The ques - tion then naturally arose as to whether or not other band 4 . 1 superfamily members such as band 4 . 1 protein ( in noneryth - roid cells ) , merlin , protein - tyrosine - phosphatase HI / MEG , and talin can interact with CD44 ( Conboy et al . , 1986 ; Rees et al . , 1990 ; Gu et al . , 1991 ; Yang et al . , 1991 ; Trofatter et al . , 1993 ; Rouleau et al . , 1993 ) . Especially , considering that the NH2 - terminal half of merlin is highly homologous to that of ERM family members ( " ~ 60 % identity ) , its interac - tion with CD44 should be evaluated both in vivo and in vitro . In humans , I > 18 CIM4 transcripts have been described to date ( for a review see Lesley et al . , 1993 ) . This heterogene - ity results from the fact that 12 of 19 exons can undergo alter - native splicing ( Screaton et al . , 1992 ) . As shown in Fig . 10 , BHK cells mainly express 85 - kD standard - type and the iso - form containing at least v9 / vl0 . These isoforms share the same cytoplasmic domain ( Screaton et al . , 1992 ) . However , the 140 - kD isoform was preferably coimmunoprecipitated with ERM family members , and only a lesser amount of the 85 - kD isoform was found in immunoprecipitates from bi - otinylated cells , although the expression level of the former was much lower than that of the latter ( Fig . 10 ) . These in - dicate that two distinct isoforms with the same cytoplasmic domain have different levels of affinity for cytoskeletons , namely , to ERM family members . In fact , Fig . 10 B shows that in BHK cells , the 140 - kD isoform was much more resis - tant to Triton X - 100 extraction than the 85 - kD isoform . This discrepancy can be rationalized as follows . So far , it was understood that the interaction of CD44 with cytoskeletons is enhanced by clustering CIM4 into a multi - meric configuration ( Geppert and Lipsky , 1991 ) . Therefore , given that the 140 - kD isoform has a tendency to form an oligomeric configuration through its insert at the extracellu - lar membrane - proximal portion , the stability of the 140 - kD isoform - ERM complex would be much higher than that of the 85 - kD isoform - ERM complex . This would result in only the 140 - kD CD44 - ERM complex being detected by immu - noprecipitation in the presence of RIPA buffer . Although no data has been so far reported to directly support this specula - tion , this speculation is consistent with our preliminary findings that the antibody - induced clustering of CIM4 mole - cules on the cell surface enhanced the interaction of the 85 - kD isoform with cytoskeletons . In living cells , because of the following reasons , we speculate that quite a number of ERM family molecules are associated with the 85 - kD isoform in an unstable and dynamic fashion , and that the rest of them are tightly and stably bound to the 140 - kD isoform : more of the 85 - kD than of the 140 - kD isoform is expressed ( Fig . 10 A ) , and about two thirds of the former are associated with cytoskeletons in the presence of 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 ( Fig . 10 B ) ; in cells extracted with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 , the insoluble CIM4 molecules , most of which may be the 85 - kD isoforms , were shown by immunofluorescent means to be precisely colocalized with ERM family members . The general con - cept that the insertion by alternative splicing at the mem - brane - proximal portion of CD44 molecules regulates the stability of the CD44 / ERM association through CD44 oligo - merization is , at present , purely speculative , and it requires experimental elucidation . Of course , the regulation mecha - nism of the CIM4 / ERM association may be more compli - cated . For example , most recently , the manner of interaction of CD44 with cytoskeletons in epithelial cells such as Madin - Darby canine kidney cells has been reported to be completely different from that in fibroblasts ( Neame and Isacke , 1993 ) . The phosphorylation of theserine residues and GTP binding in the cytoplasmic domain of CD44 may also be important for regulating the CIM4 / ERM association CKalomiris and Bourguiguon , 1988 ; Camp et al . 1991 ; Lo - keshwar and Bourguignon , 1992 ) . The present study casts a new light on the functions of CD44 molecules : the CD44 - ERM - actin filament may work as a fundamental unit in the interaction of actin filaments with plasma membranes in general . We showed here that CD44 is highly concentrated at cleavage furrows in dividing Tsukita et al . Association of ERM Family Members with CD44 399 ceils , where actin filaments are densely associated with plasma membranes . From a phylogenetic perspective , the most fundamental unit responsible for the actin filament / plasma membrane interactions should be concentrated at the cleavage furrow , because in unicellular organisms , actin illa - ments are thought to originally emerge for cytokinesis , one of the most fundamental cellular events . In this respect , CD44 ( and ERM family members ) meets the qualifications as a constituent of the fundamental unit for actin filament / plasma membrane interactions . Yonemura et al . ( 1993 ) demonstrated that the surface pro - tein CIM3 was precisely colocalized with ERM family mem - bers and concentrated at cleavage furrows in dividing cells . Furthermore , other membrane proteins such as leukocyte adhesion moleculeq and membrane immunoglobulins are reportedly concentrated at cleavage furrows ( de Petris , 1984 ; Pilarski et al . , 1991 ) . Unlike CD44 , these membrane pro - teins are expressed in some restricted types of cells , suggest - ing that they are not likely constituents of the fundamental unit for actin filament / plasma membrane interactions . Judg - ing from the precise colocalization of CD43 with ERM fam - ily members ( Yonemura et al . , 1993 ) , we speculate that these membrane proteins are laterally associated with the CD44 - ERM - actin filament unit to form a large membrane protein complex with CD44 located in the center . Studies to evaluate this hypothesis are now underway in our laboratory .
