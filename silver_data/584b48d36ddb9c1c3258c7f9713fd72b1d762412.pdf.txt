Introduction The binding of integrins to extracellular matrix ( ECM ) initiates cell adhesion , which can be described as a series of processes including cell spreading against the underlying matrix , assembly of focal adhesions ( FAs ) , and generation of actomyosin - mediated cytoskeletal tension against these adhesions [ 1 ] . Each of these pro - cesses appears to be linked through several pathways . For exam - ple , the degree of cell spreading against a micropatterned substrate regulates RhoA activity and cytoskeletal tension [ 2 , 3 ] , and this cytoskeletal tension is important for adhesion assembly [ 4 , 5 ] . Conversely , it has been shown that the clustering of integrins required for adhesion assembly is critical to support cell spreading and tension generation [ 6 , 7 ] . Because cell spreading , adhesion assembly , and cytoskeletal tension each have been shown to regu - late many cellular functions including proliferation , differentiation , and migration , understanding how these processes are regulated is an important question . Integrin receptors undergo conformational activation from a low afﬁnity to high afﬁnity state [ 8 , 9 ] , and these changes in inte - grin activity may contribute to the regulation of cell spreading and FA assembly . Indeed , direct activation of integrins via manga - nese ( Mn 2 + ) [ 10 ] or conformation - modulating antibodies [ 11 ] ap - pears to enhance cell spreading and adhesion assembly [ 12 , 13 ] . Although numerous studies have linked integrin activation to FA growth and superior cell adhesion and spreading on ECM , it is un - clear whether integrin activation can also directly regulate cyto - skeletal tension generation . In this study , we found that b 1 integrin activation via increased ﬁbronectin ( FN ) density or Mn 2 + leads to enhanced generation of cellular traction forces . We measured these forces by culturing cells on FN - functionalized arrays of uniformly spaced elastomeric microposts , a system we developed previously to enable studies of traction force dynamics [ 5 , 14 ] . Our data indicate that the activa - tion state of integrins is intimately connected to basic adherent cell behaviors like contractility , which has implications for improving our understanding of the regulation of cell shape , mechanics , and function . 0014 - 5793 / $ 36 . 00 (cid:2) 2013 Federation of European Biochemical Societies .

Richard Hynes ( MIT ) , respectively . b 1 Integrin - null MEFs were maintained as pre - viously described [ 15 ] . All cells were cultured in 10 % FBS / DMEM ( Atlanta Biologicals ) . 2 . 2 . Reagents and antibodies Reagents were obtained as follows : ﬁbronectin ( BD ) ; vitro - nectin ( Sigma ) ; lysophosphatidic acid ( Avanti Polar Lipids ) ; Y27632 ( Tocris Bioscience ) ; blebbistatin ( Calbiochem ) ; FN block - ing antibody 16G3 ( 20 l g / ml ; gift of Dr .

Cell attachment assay Plates were coated overnight at 4 (cid:3) C with FN in triplicate ( BD Biosciences ) and blocked with 50 l g / ml BSA / PBS . Cells were seeded , gently rinsed after 1 h with warm PBS , and quantiﬁed using CyQuant ( Invitrogen Molecular Probes ) . 2 . 4 . Substrate preparation Micropost array detectors ( mPADs ) were fabricated using PDMS - based replica - molding as previously described [ 5 , 16 ] . Microcontact printing FN on these or ﬂat substrates , with either continuous or 625 l m 2 islands , was performed as described previously [ 17 ] . FN concentrations of 0 . 0625 or 4 . 0 l g / ml FN in 50 l g / ml BSA are designated as low or high FN density , respectively . 2 . 5 . Western blotting Cells were lysed in Laemmli sample buffer ( Bio - Rad ) , separated via SDS – PAGE , transferred to PVDF , immunoblotted , and detected using SuperSignal West Dura detection kit ( Thermo Scientiﬁc ) . 2 . 6 . Immunoﬂuorescence , cell imaging , and quantitative analysis of focal adhesions and strain energies For immunoﬂuorescence , cells were ﬁxed with 3 . 7 % paraformal - dehyde ( Electron Microscopy Sciences ) , permeabilized with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 , and labeled using primary and then secondary anti - bodies . Quantitative analyses of adhesions and cell area were per - formed using a custom - developed MATLAB program [ 18 ] . For mPAD experiments , cells were labeled with CellTracker Green CMFDA ( Invitrogen Molecular Probes ) . Quantitative analyses of cell area and total cell strain energies on mPADs were performed as previously described [ 5 ] . 2 . 7 . Knockdown of a 5 integrin MEFs were infected with adenovirus encoding either shRNA di - rected against a 5 integrin or a scrambled sequence [ 19 ] at a MOI of 50 . Cells were trypsinized at 48 h post - infection and seeded on mPAD substrates . 2 . 8 . Statistical analysis For each box - and - whisker plot , 15 or more cells per condition were imaged and analyzed across 3 or more experiments . Statisti - cal comparisons between experimental conditions used either Mann – Whitney - U tests or Wilcoxon signed - rank tests , as indicated in individual ﬁgure legends . For all tests , statistical signiﬁcance was assigned at P - value 6 0 . 05 ( ns : non - signiﬁcant , ⁄ P 6 0 . 05 , ⁄⁄ P 6 0 . 01 , ⁄⁄⁄ P 6 0 . 001 ) . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . Integrin activation enhances cell spreading and traction force We ﬁrst conﬁrmed that increasing the density of immobilized FN and exposure to Mn 2 + enhanced integrin activation [ 20 , 21 ] in our system . Wildtype mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts ( wtMEFs ) were plated on substrates coated with a range of FN densities , cultured in the presence or absence of 1 mM Mn 2 + for 1 h , and then immu - nostained for activated b 1 integrin . In the absence of Mn 2 + , cells cultured on low FN density exhibited small peripheral b 1 inte - grin - positive adhesions ( Fig . 1A ) . In contrast , Mn 2 + treatment of cells on low FN resulted in increases in spread cell area and the number and size of b 1 integrin - positive adhesions ( Fig . 1A and B ) . On high FN densities , cells displayed greater cell spreading and adhesion number and size relative to untreated cells on low FN , and Mn 2 + treatment did not promote additional spreading ( Fig . 1A and B ) . As a functional measure of integrin - mediated adhe - sion , we show that cell attachment was improved by increasing FN density and / or Mn 2 + treatment ( Fig . 1C ) . Together , these data con - ﬁrm that shifting the equilibrium towards ECM - engaged integrin , by either increasing FN density or conformational activation of integrin by Mn 2 + , promotes cell attachment , spreading , and adhe - sion assembly . We next examined whether integrin activation impacts cyto - skeletal tension , by using elastomeric micropost array detector substrates ( mPADs ) to measure cell traction forces [ 5 ] . wtMEFs at - tached to and spread on the posts ( Fig . 1D – top left panel ) . Cell spreading correlated with FN density on mPADs similarly to ﬂat substrates , and the deﬁciency in spreading on low FN was rescued by the addition of Mn 2 + ( Fig . 1D – top right panel and E ) . Impor - tantly , we observed that Mn 2 + - induced integrin activation trig - gered enhanced cell traction forces on low FN , and increasing FN density also increased traction force generation ( Fig . 1D – bottom panels and F ) . Moreover , this enhanced traction force production was blocked by the addition of a FN blocking antibody , 16G3 ( Fig . 1G ) , demonstrating that Mn 2 + - triggered forces require the for - mation of new integrin – FN bonds . These data show that increasing the amount of ECM - engaged integrin leads to a net increase in traction forces . 3 . 2 . b 1KO MEFs have defects in Mn 2 + - induced spreading and traction force generation . Although Mn 2 + activates integrins indiscriminately , we hypoth - esized that speciﬁc integrin subtypes might be important for medi - ating the changes in cell spreading and traction force generation in our system . Therefore , we tested the responses of MEFs carrying a deletion of the b 1 gene . As originally reported [ 15 ] , expression of b 1 integrin is undetectable in these cells , as illustrated here by the ab - sence of reactivity in a anti - b 1 Western blot ( Fig . 2A ) . b 1KOs showed reduced attachment to FN ( Fig . 2B ) , relative to the robust attachment curves seen for wtMEFs ( Fig . 1C ) . To assess whether b 1KO cells could respond to Mn 2 + , we assayed whether Mn 2 + could induce cell spreading and FA assembly on low FN . While b 1KOs 764 G . L . Lin et al . / FEBS Letters 587 ( 2013 ) 763 – 769 failed to spread in the presence of Mn 2 + ( Fig . 2C – E ) , enhanced FA growth was still observed ( Fig . 2D ) . We then investigated the effect of b 1 knockout on Mn 2 + - induced cytoskeletal tension .

In fact , Mn 2 + treat - ment resulted in a statistically signiﬁcant decrease in traction forces on low FN ( Fig . 2F ) . Loss of b 1 integrin disrupts numerous integrin heterodimers , including the principal ﬁbronectin receptor a 5 b 1 integrin .

Lin et al . / FEBS Letters 587 ( 2013 ) 763 – 769 767 upon treatment with Mn 2 + , BMC5 - treated cells showed a statisti - cally signiﬁcant decrease in strain energy that paralleled the re - sponse observed in b 1KO cells ( Fig . 2H vs . F ) . Moreover , we observed a similar loss of strain energy in response to Mn 2 + treat - ment when a 5 integrin was depleted by RNA interference ( Supp . Fig . 1A and B ) . Taken together , these data suggest that the increased celltractionforceuponstimulationofintegrinactivationrequires b 1 integrin and is likely mediated by a 5 b 1 . 3 . 3 . b 1 Integrin - dependent tractions require spread cell shape , ROCK , and myosin activity To better understand the requirement for b 1 integrin in generat - ing traction forces , we investigated whether these forces were mediated by non - muscle myosin II activity and whether b 1KOs were competent to respond to other contractility agonists . We tested the role of myosin activity in Mn 2 + - induced traction by pre - treating wtMEFs with Y27632 and blebbistatin , pharmacological inhibitors of Rho kinase ( ROCK ) and myosin , respectively . Both blebbistatin ( Fig . 3A ) and Y27632 ( Fig . 3B ) prevented Mn 2 + - in - duced traction forces . Prior work from our group demonstrated that cellular contractility can also be blocked by culturing cells on small micropatterned FN islands [ 5 ] . Here we observed that micropatterned islands ( 625 l m 2 ) of high FN prevented cells from mounting traction forces in response to Mn 2 + stimulation ( Fig . 3C ) , consistent with a role for actomyosin contractile machinery in mediating Mn 2 + - dependent traction forces . Restricting cell spreading by micropatterning results in a gener - alized defect in coupling extracellular stimuli with traction force production , a relationship we have reported in multiple systems [ 5 , 16 ] . We therefore tested whether the defect in traction force production in b 1KOs could be attributed to a generalized defect in organizing or activating actomyosin contractility or was speciﬁc to Mn 2 + . Treatment of cells with lysophosphatidic acid ( LPA ) , a strong agonist for Rho - mediated myosin activation , triggered a sustained increase in traction force in both wtMEFs and b 1KOs within 1 min ( Fig . 3D and E ) , indicating that the coupling between soluble agonists and contractility remains intact in the b 1KOs . 3 . 4 . b 3 Integrin is dispensable for Mn 2 + - induced traction forces Our results suggest that , in the absence of b 1 integrin , activation of integrins induces FA assembly , but fails to induce cell spreading or traction forces on low FN . Because ﬁbroblasts also use b 3 inte - grin to bind FN , we next evaluated whether b 3 integrin activation could contribute to either enhanced cell spreading or traction forces following Mn 2 + treatment . To do so , we ﬁrst plated wtMEFs on vitronectin , a preferential ligand for b 3 integrin [ 22 ] . Upon treat - ment with Mn 2 + , wtMEFs on vitronectin increased spread cell area ( Fig . 4A ) but generated no additional net traction force ( Fig . 4B ) . These data suggest that b 3 integrin engagement with ECM li - gand is not sufﬁcient to mediate Mn 2 + - induced traction forces but could support cell spreading . To test the role of b 3 integrin in the response to Mn 2 + more directly , we examined the effect of Mn 2 + on b 3 - null MEFs ( b 3KOs ) [ 23 ] . Similar to wtMEFs , b 3KOs trea - ted with Mn 2 + demonstrated an increase in spread cell area and FA growth and number ( Fig . 4C and D ) . Likewise , the b 3KOs increased cell traction forces after Mn 2 + treatment ( Fig . 4E ) . Thus , b 3 integrin activation can promote cell spreading ; however , it is dispensable for Mn 2 + - induced traction force generation . 4 . Discussion Cellular traction forces play an integral role in cell adhesion to matrices . These forces regulate FA assembly , presumably by acting directly on integrins to activate them through ‘‘inside - out’’ signal - ing [ 4 , 5 ] . Additionally , myosin - mediated contractility regulates adhesion through recruitment of signaling proteins to FAs [ 24 , 25 ] . Signaling downstream from these FA proteins impacts pro - liferation [ 26 ] , differentiation [ 27 ] , migration [ 28 , 29 ] , and other higher - level cellular functions . Here , we show ‘‘outside - in’’ signals that promote integrin activation ( increased FN density , Mn 2 + ) also trigger traction force generation . This ﬁnding clariﬁes how the cell might sense matrix density through ECM - modulated integrin afﬁn - ity that directly adjusts cytoskeletal tension to beﬁt the microenvironment . Integrin activation could modulate cell traction forces through several possible mechanisms . Here , we reveal that traction forces induced by integrin activation require Rho kinase and myosin activity , suggesting that Rho GTPases could be involved . Alterna - tively , integrin adhesion complexes can nucleate actin polymeriza - tion via Arp2 / 3 in a manner dependent on the density of ligated integrins [ 30 , 31 ] and independently of Rho GTPases [ 32 ] . Actin polymerization creates protrusive force [ 33 ] that can drive cell motility [ 34 ] and may contribute to the integrin - mediated forces reported in this work . Different integrin subtypes often have overlapping functions , with some instances where distinct integrins produce unique ef - fects on cells . For example , both a 5 b 1 and a V b 3 integrins bind FN , but drive divergent migratory behavior ; a 5 b 1 – FN adhesion pro - motes thin cell protrusions and random cell migration whereas a V b 3 – FN adhesion supports persistent migration with broad lamel - lipodia [ 35 ] . In fact , it has been proposed that these effects are mediated through a change in the balance of Rho / Rac signaling [ 35 ] . Here we show that in normal cells , Mn 2 + stimulates cell trac - tion forces in a b 1 integrin - dependent manner , whereas in cells deﬁcient in a 5 or b 1 , Mn 2 + stimulation leads to a decrease in trac - tion forces . While the mechanism of decreased traction forces in a 5 or b 1 deﬁcient cells is as yet unknown , it is interesting to spec - ulate that a v b 3 - speciﬁc signaling , such as to Rac1 GTPase , may play a role . Our ﬁnding that activation of b 1 integrin contributes to en - hanced traction forces is consistent with previous studies in which force production on ﬁbronectin substrates is disrupted by a 5 b 1 blocking antibody in ﬁbroblasts [ 36 ] or myocytes [ 37 ] . It is interesting that the same b 1 integrin subtype that induces intracellular forces also undergoes conformational activation in response to extracellular forces and uniquely displays catch - bond and adhesion strength - reinforcing behavior upon force transmission [ 38 – 41 ] . In view of these previous studies , our re - sults suggest that feedback between force sensing and traction force generation may be a necessary component to the cell mechanotransduction system . Further studies on the regulation of basic cell functions by integrins will help shed light on how cells manage complex behavior in response to mechanical and adhesivecues .
