Abstract : An information search trail recommendation method based on the Markov chain model and case - based reasoning is proposed . A laboratory user experiment was designed to evaluate the proposed method . The experimental results demonstrated that novice searchers have a positive attitude toward the search trail recommendation and a willingness to use the recommendation . Importantly , this study found that the search trail recommendation could effectively improve novice searchers’ search performance . This finding is mainly reflected in the diversity of information sources and the integrity of the information content of the search results . The proposed search trail recommendation method extends the application scope of information recommendations and provides insights to improve the organization and management of online information resources . Keywords : Web search , search process , search trail recommendation , Markov chain , case - based reasoning 1 Introduction Using Web search engines , people can obtain a piece of information or navigate to a target website quickly . However , frequently , many information search tasks are complex or exploratory , such as acquiring knowledge items of a particular subject or writing a course thesis . The information needs of these tasks include multiple aspects or steps , and the search processes often require access to different types of websites . However , in practice , many novice searchers find that locating the appropriate websites efficiently is difficult . As a result , many specialist websites fail to establish connections with target users . Fortunately , expert searchers with certain domain knowledge , search experience , or skills can conduct efficient searches and locate the appropriate websites or website sequences to find what they are looking for ( Tabatabai & Shore , 2005 ) . White , Dumais , and Teevan ( 2009 ) recommend that query suggestions and website recommendations generated through domain experts’ search history could be provided to novice searchers to help them gain expertise . They even envisaged developing such Web search support services in future research . Some previous studies have attempted to support new searchers by providing webpage recommendations ( Hendahewa & Shah , 2017 ; White , Bilenko , & Cucerzan , 2007 ) , optimizing webpage rankings ( Ziegler , McNee , Konstan , & Lausen , 2005 ) , and query expansion ( Smith , Gwizdka , & Field , 2016 ; Huang , Wang , Zhang , & Liu , 2020 ) . However , such supports are often insufficient to meet complex information needs . Novice searchers may need support that alerts them to the steps , or a webpage sequence , or websites required for complex task completion . Previous studies have shown that trails or tours consisting of filtered documents or webpages can reveal the value of user search processes , and trail - based search recommendations could improve new searchers’ overall search performance . For example , White and Huang ( 2010 ) demonstrated that following search trails provides significant additional benefits to searchers in terms of coverage , diversity , novelty , and utility over origin pages * Corresponding author : Yiming Zhao , School of Information Management , Wuhan University , Wuhan , China , Email : zhaoyiming @ whu . edu . cn Afeng Wang , School of Information Management , Wuhan University , Wuhan , China Yijin Chen , School of Economic and Management , South China Normal University , Guangzhou , China Open Access . © 2021 Afeng Wang , Yiming Zhao , Yijin Chen , published by Sciendo .

Hendahewa and Shah ( 2017 ) found that , with the help of search trail recommendations , searchers can find more information across multiple facets and dig deeper into the detail associated with certain facets . However , most search trails mined from logs often only contain pages visited after a single query rather than all pages or websites visited during the full search process of a search task . Besides , to date , proposed methods for finding trails often focus on trails consisting of webpages that may be sensitive to Web dynamism ( e . g . , dead links or changing content ) , rather than a more general level of abstraction ( e . g . , website categories ) that may be more widely applicable . Moreover , showing the trails to searchers directly on the search engine result page ( SERP ) is also an unaddressed challenge ( Hassan & White , 2012 ) . Addressing the shortcomings of previous studies , our primary goal is to present and evaluate a method to create search trails that can help novice searchers perform complex search tasks . We focus on ( i ) how to model and recommend search - task relevant trails of expert searchers and ( ii ) whether the search trail recommendation is useful for novice searchers . The remainder of this paper is organized as follows . An extensive literature review of search trail recommendation studies , the utility of the Markov chain model for Web path analysis , and the case - based reasoning ( CBR ) approach are presented in Section 2 . In Section 3 , we introduce our proposed information search trail recommendation method based on the Markov chain model and the CBR approach . In Section 4 , we describe a user study designed to evaluate the search trail recommendation method . The user study was conducted in a laboratory environment , and the results were analyzed to determine how novice searchers evaluate the effectiveness of search trail recommendations . The implications and limitations of this research and suggestions for future research are summarized in Section 5 . 2 Related Work Several research areas are relevant to the current study : ( i ) search trail modeling and recommendations , ( ii ) the Markov chain model , and ( iii ) CBR searching . In this section , we describe relevant studies in each area in more detail and discuss how the current research could extend them . 2 . 1 Search Trails Modeling and Recommendation Some researchers defined the search trail as a search path that comprises query and post - query pages visited to carry out relevant studies ( Bilenko & White , 2008 ; Singla , White , & Huang , 2010 ; Hendahewa & Shah , 2017 ) . Recently , Capra and Arguello ( 2019 ) defined a search trail as an interactive visualization of how a searcher performs a search task . The visualization may include queries posted , sites or pages visited , and annotations made . It is evident that the latter definition has a larger scope and greater applicability . Thus , we adopted the second definition to carry out our research . Berrypicking , orienteering , and information foraging are three well - known information seeking models related to search trails . The berrypicking model describes the movement between information sources associated with dynamic information needs ( Bates , 1989 ) . The orienteering analogy was proposed to understand searchers’ information seeking strategies ( O’Day & Jeffries , 1993 ) . Information foraging emphasizes how information searchers use clues left by previous visitors to find information ( Pirolli & Card , 1999 ) . Interaction logging has implicitly made us all trailblazers of search trails ( White & Huang , 2010 ) . Trails or tours created by previous searchers form links between stored information resources that can help other searchers make better decisions about information source selection during the search process . Trigg ( 1988 ) proposed a guided tour consisting of a sequence of hypertext pages to alleviate disorientation for new searchers . Wheeldon and Levene ( 2003 ) proposed an algorithm to generate trails as trees to assist searchers in Web navigation . The results showed that participants found these trails useful for navigation . Singla , White , and Huang ( 2010 ) proposed trailfinding methods to support Web searches by identifying query - relevant trails from logs that could be shown to complement or replace traditional search result lists . Recently , Hendahewa and Shah ( 2017 ) demonstrated that recommending search trails of each query to struggling users in exploratory search tasks could better assist them to find the information they were seeking . Moreover , the results showed that the order of the recommended search trails plays an important role . Capra and Arguello ( 2019 ) discovered that task determinability is a significant factor that affects whether to recommend search trails . Besides , they found that the system should provide trails with the same scope as the searcher’s task . Search trail recommendation systems , such as WebWatcher ( Joachims , Freitag , & Mitchell , 1997 ) , Footprints ( Wexelblat & Maes , Information Search Trail Recommendation Based on Markov Chain Model and Case - based Reasoning 229 230 Afeng Wang , Yiming Zhao , Yijin Chen 1999 ) , ScentTrails ( Olston & Chi , 2003 ) , Volant ( Pandit & Olston , 2007 ) , and SearchGuide ( Capra , & Arguello , 2019 ) , highlight candidate pages to indicate paths to search results . Research into these systems has shown that they can effectively improve user search performance . It is worth noting that , in terms of search quality , Yuan and White ( 2012 ) found that better quality search trails are created by domain experts . Therefore , it seems wise that experts construct guided search trails or tours . Thus , we considered this when we constructed the search trails recommendation database . The approach we describe in this article extends existing studies in several different ways . First , we organize potential search - task relevant trail recommendations by mining expert searchers’ search logs using the Markov chain model and CBR approach . Second , search trails are constructed at the website category level rather than at the webpage or document level . This approach allows us to detect higher - level patterns of search behavior . Third , we aim to provide searchers with a holistic view of the search trail and one - step recommendations during the search process , which may lead to more effective information search strategies for novice searchers . 2 . 2 Markov Chain Model In a search trail recommendation system , modeling the search trail is a significant component ; therefore , the next step is to select an appropriate mathematical model to model experts’ search trails . Probabilistic models have been applied successfully to many time series prediction problems . In particular , Markov chains and Markov models have achieved great success in sequence generation . Markov chains allow the system to dynamically model the URL access patterns observed in the logs based on the previous state . In addition , the Markov chain model can be used in generative models to obtain trails automatically . The Markov state transition matrix can be viewed as a “user traversal” representation of the Web space ( Sarukkai , 2000 ) . The utility of the Markov chain model has been demonstrated in many domains , such as link prediction and path analysis ( Sarukkai , 2000 ) , the personalized recommendation in information retrieval systems ( Liu , Huang , & An , 2007 ) , exhibition booth visit recommendations ( Moon , Kim , & Ryu , 2013 ) , and path prediction in Internet of things ( IoT ) systems ( Piccialli , Cuomo , Giampaolo , Casolla , & di Cola , 2020 ) . For example , Sarukkai ( 2000 ) presented an algorithm for search tour generation using Markov chains and demonstrated that Markov chains are useful tools for Web link sequence modeling and path analysis . Liu , Huang , and An ( 2007 ) proposed a mixture of Markov models to cluster searchers , capture the sequential relationships in searchers’ access histories , and provide searchers with personalized recommendations . In this paper , we apply the Markov chain model to analyze the search trail of site nodes . The state transition matrix of the Markov chain model can be considered as a “weighted traversal” representation of the user’s model of the Web space , and further analysis can be performed on this matrix , such as link relationships between different categories of websites . 2 . 3 CBR Searching The principle of the CBR approach is analogical reasoning , and its basic idea is that new problems can be solved with the help of the solutions to similar past problems ( Gentner , 1983 ; Hüllermeier , 2007 ) . The knowledge base of the CBR system consists of a collection of cases and a set of search criteria used to retrieve cases similar to the target problem ( Althuizen & Wierenga , 2014 ) . A historical case in the case base is represented as c = ( Specification , Solution ) , where Specification is the description of the problem consisting of 𝑛 features , and Solution provides the solution to the problem . The CBR approach was originally applied in the field of artificial intelligence ( Aamodt & Plaza , 1994 ) . And now , the CBR approach has since been applied in many other fields , such as business ( Gavetti , & Rivkin , 2005 ; Goldstein , 2001 ; Gregan - Paxton & Cote , 2000 ) , medical diagnosis ( Bichindaritz & Marling , 2006 ) , information seeking ( He , Erdelez , Wang , & Shyu , 2008 ; Alptekin & Büyüközkan , 2011 ) , engineering ( Shokouhi , Skalle , & Aamodt , 2014 ) , architecture , and law ( Bridge , Göker , McGinty , & Smyth , 2006 ; Hüllermeier , 2007 ) . For example , doctors may benefit from using a CBR system that accesses the case of a previously treated patient with symptoms similar to those of a new patient ( Bichindaritz & Marling , 2006 ) . Although many studies have focused on search trail recommendations , few studies consider CBR searching . Moore , Erdelez , and He ( 2006 ) conducted a controlled experiment that demonstrated the difference between traditional keyword searching and CBR searching . However , the authors did not explain why the difference occurs . He and Tian ( 2017 ) conducted an 8 - year longitudinal analysis of the query logs of a Web - based case library system . They found those return users employed CBR searching much more frequently than one - time users . Information Search Trail Recommendation Based on Markov Chain Model and Case - based Reasoning 231 In addition , return users tended to use more query terms to find information . We assume that a recommendation based on the CBR approach might recommend search strategies that reflect how experts conducted search tasks ( e . g . , search trails at the websites level ) to novice searchers who perform the same or similar tasks , which will extend the scope of search recommendation . Therefore , in this study , the CBR method was adopted by storing expert searchers’ search trails of site nodes in the case base and generating recommendations for novice searchers who need to solve the same or a similar task . 3 Search Trail Recommendation Method Based on Markov Chain Model and CBR Approach In this section , we describe the search trail recommendation procedure . First , the Markov chain model was used to extract the search trails of the user information search process . The full search trail , that is , the sequence of Internet information sources that experts visited , and one - step trail , that is , the transfer probability of Internet information sources categories , are identified and stored in the form of a case base that serves as the data source of information search trail recommendations for novices . Then , based on the CBR approach , the expert search trail is re - used as recommended content to improve a novice’s information search experience and information resource utilization efficiency . 3 . 1 Search - Task Relevant Search Trails Generation The search task is the original driving force of a searcher’s information seeking behavior . The search task shapes the searcher’s interaction with various information sources during the search process ( Li & Belkin , 2010 ) . Task attributes , such as type , complexity , and goal , greatly influence how a searcher formulates their search strategy and their search behavior ( Kim , 2009 ; Li , 2009 ; Li & Belkin , 2010 ) . First , the sequence in which searchers access Internet sources during a search task must be identified . A sequence of Internet sources accessed by a searcher when performing a search task is described in Equation ( 1 ) as follows : ( ) 1 2 = , , , , , , i j l Src Src Src Src Src   SrcSeq ( 1 ) To handle the large volume of Internet sources , we propose using Internet source categories to reduce the state space of Markov models as follows : ( ) 1 2 , , , , , , i j l SrcCat SrcCat SrcCat SrcCat SrcCat =   SrcCatSeq ( ) 1 2 , , , , , , i j l SrcCat SrcCat SrcCat SrcCat SrcCat =   SrcCatSeq ( 2 ) In Equation ( 2 ) , { } 1 2 , , , n i SrcCat Cat cat cat cat = ∈  , n represents the number of Internet sources categories and indicates that there are n states in the Markov chain model . Then , deploying the CBR approach , the Markov chain model of search - task relevant search trails can be expressed as follows : ( ) = , Cat , S , SC , tmc T A ( 3 ) Here , T is a set of properties that describe the search task and also represents a set of criteria for retrieving cases that are similar to the target search task . S denotes collections of Internet source sequences and SC represents information source category sequences generated by expert searchers when performing certain information search tasks . A is the transition probability matrix of the search trail Markov model of certain information search tasks . The transition probability matrix can be trained using historical data . Without loss of generality , this study uses the principle of maximum likelihood to estimate A . Mathematical representations of T , S , SC , and A are given as follows : ( ) 1 , , m a a =  T ( 4 ) { } , , , 1 2 k S = SrcSeq SrcSeq SrcSeq  ( 5 ) { } , , , 1 2 k SC = SrcCatSeq SrcCatSeq SrcCatSeq  ( 6 ) ( ) 1 1 11 12 2 2 21 22 1 2 1 2 j n j n ij ij i i in nj n n nn p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p           = =           A                     ( 7 ) ( ) ( ) 1 , , i j ij n i j j C cat cat p C cat cat = = ∑ ( 8 ) ( ) { } | , , , 1 , , i i i i i i i tmc tmc tmc tmc tmc TMC Cat , S , SC i = N = = tmc tmc T A  ( 9 ) ( ) ( ) { | , , } i i tmc i ET sim q TMC = ≥ ∀ ∈ SrchTsk tmc SrchTsk T tmc ( 10 ) { } 1 2 TMC = tmc , tmc ( ) 1 1 1 1 1 1 tmc tmc tmc tmc tmc , Cat , S , SC , = tmc T A ( ) 2 2 2 2 2 2 tmc tmc tmc tmc tmc , Cat , S , SC , = tmc T A ( ) 1 tmc Class presentation , Low task complexity , Knowledge about " cloud computing " = T ( ) 2 tmc Course thesis , High task complexity , Artificial intelligence in education or healthcare = T ( 5 ) { } , , , 1 2 k S = SrcSeq SrcSeq SrcSeq  ( 5 ) { } , , , 1 2 k SC = SrcCatSeq SrcCatSeq SrcCatSeq  ( 6 ) ( ) 1 1 11 12 2 2 21 22 1 2 1 2 j n j n ij ij i i in nj n n nn p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p           = =           A                     ( 7 ) ( ) ( ) 1 , , i j ij n i j j C cat cat p C cat cat = = ∑ ( 8 ) ( ) { } | , , , 1 , , i i i i i i i tmc tmc tmc tmc tmc TMC Cat , S , SC i = N = = tmc tmc T A  ( 9 ) ( ) ( ) { | , , } i i tmc i ET sim q TMC = ≥ ∀ ∈ SrchTsk tmc SrchTsk T tmc ( 10 ) { } 1 2 TMC = tmc , tmc ( ) 1 1 1 1 1 1 tmc tmc tmc tmc tmc , Cat , S , SC , = tmc T A ( ) 2 2 2 2 2 2 tmc tmc tmc tmc tmc , Cat , S , SC , = tmc T A ( ) 1 tmc Class presentation , Low task complexity , Knowledge about " cloud computing " = T ( ) 2 tmc Course thesis , High task complexity , Artificial intelligence in education or healthcare = T ( 6 ) ( 7 ) { } , , , 1 2 k S = SrcSeq SrcSeq SrcSeq  ( 5 ) { } , , , 1 2 k SC = SrcCatSeq SrcCatSeq SrcCatSeq  ( 6 ) ( ) 1 1 11 12 2 2 21 22 1 2 1 2 j n j n ij ij i i in nj n n nn p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p           = =           A                     ( 7 ) ( ) ( ) 1 , , i j ij n i j j C cat cat p C cat cat = = ∑ ( 8 ) ( ) { } | , , , 1 , , i i i i i i i tmc tmc tmc tmc tmc TMC Cat , S , SC i = N = = tmc tmc T A  ( 9 ) ( ) ( ) { | , , } i i tmc i ET sim q TMC = ≥ ∀ ∈ SrchTsk tmc SrchTsk T tmc ( 10 ) { } 1 2 TMC = tmc , tmc ( ) 1 1 1 1 1 1 tmc tmc tmc tmc tmc , Cat , S , SC , = tmc T A ( ) 2 2 2 2 2 2 tmc tmc tmc tmc tmc , Cat , S , SC , = tmc T A ( ) 1 tmc Class presentation , Low task complexity , Knowledge about " cloud computing " = T ( ) 2 tmc Course thesis , High task complexity , Artificial intelligence in education or healthcare = T 232 Afeng Wang , Yiming Zhao , Yijin Chen The element in A is described in Equation ( 8 ) : { } , , , 1 2 k S = SrcSeq SrcSeq SrcSeq  ( 5 ) { } , , , 1 2 k SC = SrcCatSeq SrcCatSeq SrcCatSeq  ( 6 ) ( ) 1 1 11 12 2 2 21 22 1 2 1 2 j n j n ij ij i i in nj n n nn p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p           = =           A                     ( 7 ) ( ) ( ) 1 , , i j ij n i j j C cat cat p C cat cat = = ∑ ( 8 ) ( ) { } | , , , 1 , , i i i i i i i tmc tmc tmc tmc tmc TMC Cat , S , SC i = N = = tmc tmc T A  ( 9 ) ( ) ( ) { | , , } i i tmc i ET sim q TMC = ≥ ∀ ∈ SrchTsk tmc SrchTsk T tmc ( 10 ) { } 1 2 TMC = tmc , tmc ( ) 1 1 1 1 1 1 tmc tmc tmc tmc tmc , Cat , S , SC , = tmc T A ( ) 2 2 2 2 2 2 tmc tmc tmc tmc tmc , Cat , S , SC , = tmc T A ( ) 1 tmc Class presentation , Low task complexity , Knowledge about " cloud computing " = T ( ) 2 tmc Course thesis , High task complexity , Artificial intelligence in education or healthcare = T ( 8 ) In Equation ( 8 ) , C ( cat j , cat i ) is the count of the number of times cat j follows cat i in the dataset SC . Although Markov chains have traditionally been used to characterize the asymptotic properties of random variables , we use the transition matrix to estimate short - term link predictions of Internet sources . An element of the matrix A , say p ij can be interpreted as the probability of transitioning from state cat i to cat j in a single step . Similarly , an element of A ∗ A will denote the probability of transitioning from one state to another in two steps , and so on . To provide novices with a recommendation for the next possible Internet source to be selected , we feed the current Internet source into the model and let the transition matrix determine the optimal candidates . Then , based on the Markov chain model , the search - task relevant search trails case base , which we refer to as TMC , is formally expressed as follows . { } , , , 1 2 k S = SrcSeq SrcSeq SrcSeq  ( 5 ) { } , , , 1 2 k SC = SrcCatSeq SrcCatSeq SrcCatSeq  ( 6 ) ( ) 1 1 11 12 2 2 21 22 1 2 1 2 j n j n ij ij i i in nj n n nn p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p           = =           A                     ( 7 ) ( ) ( ) 1 , , i j ij n i j j C cat cat p C cat cat = = ∑ ( 8 ) ( ) { } | , , , 1 , , i i i i i i i tmc tmc tmc tmc tmc TMC Cat , S , SC i = N = = tmc tmc T A  ( 9 ) ( ) ( ) { | , , } i i tmc i ET sim q TMC = ≥ ∀ ∈ SrchTsk tmc SrchTsk T tmc ( 10 ) { } 1 2 TMC = tmc , tmc ( ) 1 1 1 1 1 1 tmc tmc tmc tmc tmc , Cat , S , SC , = tmc T A ( ) 2 2 2 2 2 2 tmc tmc tmc tmc tmc , Cat , S , SC , = tmc T A ( ) 1 tmc Class presentation , Low task complexity , Knowledge about " cloud computing " = T ( ) 2 tmc Course thesis , High task complexity , Artificial intelligence in education or healthcare = T ( 9 ) In Equation ( 9 ) , tmc i represents the search trail recommendation case of a certain type of search task , and N represents the number of cases in the case base . 3 . 2 Search Trail Recommendation Procedure 3 . 2 . 1 Retrieving Similar Relevant Cases To retrieve the expert search trails for the recommendation , the similarity of task characteristic attributes between the current search task ( SrchTsk ) and the task in the search trails case base should be calculated .

After the searcher inputs the description of the search task , the search trail recommendations list ranked by similarity will be generated in a timely manner . The left part of the interface presents the default search engine’s results list , and the right part presents the search trail recommendations . The upper half of the right part presents the S and SC lists , that is , the full search trail list . The lower half displays the Internet source categories that expert searchers are most likely to investigate next under the current Internet source , that is , the one - step trail recommendations . If the vector ( ) t + 1 s denotes the probability vector for all states at time t 1 + . Given the history of “Internet information sources” of the novice searcher , , , ( t - k ) ( t - k + 1 ) ( t )  s s s , each Internet information source could be represented as a vector with probability 1 at Figure 1 .

The interface for a specific Internet source is represented in Figure 2 . The Internet source cases under each category are given , as shown in Figures 1 and 2 . 4 Evaluation In this section , we describe a user study that was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the search trail recommendation method proposed in this paper . First , the search trails generation method proposed in Section 3 is used to identify and organize the search trails generated by expert searchers when performing some search tasks . Then , novice searchers are organized to perform the same or similar tasks , and the relevant search trail recommendations are provided during the search process . Finally , based on novice searchers’ attitudes ( e . g . , perceived usefulness , satisfaction , and acceptance ) toward the search trail recommendations and their search results performance , the recommendation method proposed in this study can be evaluated . In addition , the characteristics of tasks and searchers that may influence a searcher’s willingness to engage with search trails , and their ability to benefit from these search trails could be studied deeply . If the results of the user study show that novice searchers benefit from search trail recommendations , likely post - task trails could be considered in real search system design and even as units of retrieval in practice . 4 . 1 User Experiment Design 4 . 1 . 1 Data Collection Questionnaire surveys , screen recordings , think - aloud guidelines , and interviews were used to collect data . Before the experiment , participants were asked to complete an entry questionnaire that was used to collect user demographic data , including search experience and habits , as well as their attitude toward sharing search trails or accepting the search trail recommendations . A software tool recorded all participant activities during the experiment . A think - aloud guideline was designed to elicit participants’ cognitive activities during their search performances . After the search experiment , a post - search questionnaire queried the novice searchers’ perceptions of their search results , search performance , difficulties , and the search trail recommendations provided during the search process . In addition , we conducted follow - up interviews to explore the novice searchers’ comments and suggestions about the search trail recommendations . 4 . 1 . 2 Participants In this experiment , participants were recruited from an iSchool at a national major university in China . Twelve participants , all of whom had experience searching on the Internet , were recruited . Each participant was paid RMB 50 Yuan as compensation . One senior undergraduate and four postgraduates were recruited as expert searchers ( one male , four females , denoted [ ] , = 1 , , 5 expert i i  ) . All expert searchers had considerable information literacy training before the experiment , and all were willing to share search trail experience with others . Seven freshmen were recruited as novice searchers ( two males , five females , denoted [ ] , = 1 , , 7 novice j j  ) . None of the novice searchers had information literacy training experience prior to the experiment . 4 . 1 . 3 Materials and Apparatus 4 . 1 . 3 . 1 Tasks During the experiment , the subjects were asked to solve two information problems : one low complexity task and one high complexity task , as shown in Table 1 . In this experiment , the task context refers to an environment that involves a combination of various factors and conditions , such as task product and search time . Participants could search for information on the Internet without any restrictions while performing these search tasks . Each task requires the submission of a document containing the required information collected and organized by the searcher . 4 . 1 . 3 . 2 Setting and Equipment The information search experiment was conducted in a laboratory . EV software was installed on the computers and the entire experiment was recorded . Both screen 234 Afeng Wang , Yiming Zhao , Yijin Chen capture and audio recording modes were used to record the entire task performance process and the participants’ verbalized thoughts . The questionnaire survey was launched using wjx . cn , a Web - based survey tool . 4 . 1 . 4 Measurements 4 . 1 . 4 . 1 Internet Information Source Categories In this experiment , considering the tasks , we classified Internet information sources into the categories listed in Table 2 . 4 . 1 . 4 . 2 Attitude Measurements This study adopted and modified some attitude measurements ( Bhattacherjee , 2001 ; Lin & Wang , 2012 ) to investigate novice searchers’ perceived usefulness , satisfaction , and acceptance attitudes toward the search trail recommendations provided in this experiment . The measurement items are listed in Table 3 . Each evaluation dimension score is the average of all measurement items , where 1 was the lowest score and 7 was the highest score . 4 . 1 . 5 Procedure Prior to participating in the experiment , the participants were given a description of the experiment and completed the entry questionnaire . After reading the search task assignment , they were asked to read the “think - aloud guideline” carefully . In addition , participants labeled as novice searchers received a list of recommended search trails generated by participants labeled as expert searchers performing similar tasks , and they were asked to use these recommendations as much as possible . After finishing the search , all participants were asked to complete a post - search questionnaire . Besides , we conducted an exit interview with each participant .

This result shows that novice searchers could benefit from search trail recommendations and are willing to accept this search recommendation during the search process . The extremely large score values for each measurement item indicate that different novice searchers may have different perceptions of the search trail recommendation . Therefore , we used the k - means clustering algorithm to cluster the scores ( i . e . , perceived usefulness , satisfaction , and acceptance ) . Here , the number of categories was set to 3 . The clustering results are shown in Table 7 . According to the ratings , clusters 1 , 2 , and 3 are classified as high , medium , and low rating groups . Among the novice searchers , there were two participants in the high rating group , four participants in the medium rating group , and one participant in the low rating group . Then , we performed an in - depth analysis of the different rating groups . In this analysis , we considered the participants’ background information , search behavior data , post - experiment questionnaire results , and data generated from interviews . 4 . 2 . 2 . 1 High - Rating Group Novice [ 3 ] and novice [ 7 ] assigned a score greater than 5 to each evaluation item , indicating that they may have benefited significantly from the search trail recommendation during the search process . These novice participants said that the search trail recommendation was useful , enriched the diversity of information sources , and potentially , improved their search skills . They indicated that , before this experiment , they only used Baidu , the largest Chinese search engine , to search for information . They did not know that they could search for information in databases or professional forums . The background survey showed that novice [ 3 ] only searched for academic information online once a week . In this experiment , novice [ 3 ] demonstrated that , during the search process , she had difficulty selecting information sources and forming queries . Novice [ 7 ] stated that she only searched for academic information once a month , and she reported that her search skills were poor . She has difficulty expressing her information needs clearly . Novice [ 7 ] explained that “After reading the task requirements , I don’t know how to make a search strategy and don’t know which information source to search from at first . Fortunately , with the help of the search trail recommendation , I learned about many types of online information sources . In this experiment , the diversity of information sources and content in the search results is good , with greatly improved compared to before . I felt that my search skills had also improved . ” 4 . 2 . 2 . 2 Medium - Rating Group The perception of usefulness , satisfaction , and acceptance scores for the search trail recommendation given by novice [ 2 ] , novice [ 4 ] , novice [ 5 ] , and novice [ 6 ] were all higher than 4 . These novices indicated that the search trail recommendation helped them to increase the diversity of their searches . The background survey showed that these students only searched for academic information online once every 3 days or once a month . Novice [ 5 ] felt that her information search skills were poor and that she had difficulty expressing her information needs clearly . However , she did not want to use a complex search strategy or change her search habits . Novice [ 4 ] and novice [ 6 ] also indicated low confidence in their information search abilities . However , novice [ 4 ] expressed willingness to use a complex search approach , and novice [ 6 ] expressed willingness to change their search strategy to suit different search tasks . Compared with other users , search results of novice [ 5 ] included relatively few information sources and low diversity of content . Participants in this cluster indicated that they usually obtained information from the Baidu search engine , Online encyclopedia , and E - journal databases . They also acknowledged that they had difficulty choosing information sources during the search process . For example , novice [ 2 ] said , “I don’t know whether to use a search engine or go to a database ; ” novice [ 4 ] said , “I feel that the content I find on different pages is the same ; ” and novice [ 6 ] said , “I don’t know which information source can find more information . ” These problems infer that these participants have no idea how to get diverse information . 4 . 2 . 2 . 3 Low - Rating Group Novice [ 1 ] assigned a low score to perceptions of usefulness and satisfaction for both the full trail and the one - step trail recommendations for search tasks with high or low complexity . He assigned a score of 4 to the perception of acceptance , which indicated that he did not reject such recommendations . In the exit interview , novice [ 1 ] stated that the one - step trail recommendation could prompt 238 Afeng Wang , Yiming Zhao , Yijin Chen him to obtain information from other information sources after obtaining information from some Internet sources . However , the recommendation of five full trails with different sequence patterns confused him and he did not know which one to choose . The background survey showed that novice [ 1 ] searched for academic information online every day . He believes that he can clearly express his information needs and find the information easily . Novice [ 1 ] used various Internet sources in both search tasks , and his search results showed diversity . The difficulties he encountered in the search process were primarily related to queries , for example , “When searching for information about unfamiliar professional words , I could not find relevant pages in SERP by directly pasting its abbreviation in the search engine . ” 5 Discussion and Conclusion In this paper , we have proposed a method to learn the behavior of expert searchers to support novice searchers engaged in the same or similar complex tasks . Developing the proposed method involves identifying the sequence of internet information sources explored by expert searchers using Markov chains and organizing these search experiences using a search - task relevant case base . We employ the CBR approach to generate search - task relevant search trail recommendations for novice searchers to assist them in identifying necessary steps or information sources to achieve task completion . We demonstrate through a user study that our task - relevant search trail recommendations can help improve novice searchers’ search performance . The novice searchers who participated in the user study were satisfied with the search trail recommendations and were willing to use them in the future . 5 . 1 Discussion The user study results showed that novice searchers have positive attitudes toward the search trail recommendation . Most novice searchers stated that the recommendation helped improve the diversity of information sources and the integrity of the search results’ information content . They also indicated that they were satisfied with the search trail recommendation provided during the search process . All novice searchers were willing to accept the search trail recommendation . An in - depth analysis of novice searchers’ evaluations of the search trail recommendation found that searchers with different evaluation levels have different information search experience and habits ( Table 8 ) , encountered different problems in the search process , and have different task performance results ( Table 9 ) . Participants with a high rating for search trail recommendations stated that the recommendation could help them to develop search strategies and select the category and quantity of information sources . Typically , they search online for academic information infrequently and are not confident in their search skills . During the information search process , they encountered difficulty understanding task requirements , developing an information search strategy , selecting information sources , and formulating queries . Participants in the medium rating group stated that the search trail recommendations could complement their source categories and increase the number of relevant sources during the search process . Table 8 Information Search Experience and Habits of Different Rating Clusters Rating No . Information search experience and habits Search frequency Complex search intention Search confidence Change search strategy intention High 3 Medium Medium Medium Low 7 Low High Low Low Medium 2 Medium High High Low 4 Low High Medium Low 5 Low Low Low Low 6 Medium Medium Low Medium Low 1 High Medium High Low Information Search Trail Recommendation Based on Markov Chain Model and Case - based Reasoning 239 They searched for online academic information every few days or once a month , with low search confidence . For this group , the difficulties encountered in the search process were primarily associated with information source selection and evaluation of the retrieved result . One novice searcher gave the search trail recommendation a low evaluation , which indicates that this recommendation did not significantly improve his information source diversity . This novice searcher searched for online information frequently , had a high degree of search confidence , and was willing to try a complex search . The only difficulties he encountered during the search process related to queries , and his search results were sufficient . This experiment found that , related to the search trail recommendation , novice searchers who were willing to conduct complex search activities or to change search habits obtained information search results that demonstrated good information source diversity and content integrity . However , even though novice [ 5 ] was provided with search trail recommendations , her search results were relatively poor . This may have occurred because she has poor search skills and is unwilling to try complex searches or change her search habits . Some novice searchers suggested that it would be more beneficial to include expert searchers’ evaluation of each Internet source category in the search trail . This would allow them to know what information sources the expert searchers used and why the experts used these sources . Some novice searchers expect search engines to automatically separate aspects of an information search task . Besides , search engine result pages could be layered to display corresponding information source results , which would greatly reduce the searcher’s workload and improve the effectiveness of search results . 5 . 2 Implications The research presented in this paper could extend previous studies in several ways . First , the search - task relevant search trail recommendations proposed in this study expanded the scope of traditional trail recommendations , which primarily focus on query - relevant trail origins , sub - trails , and destination recommendations ( White & Huang , 2010 ) . Our findings suggest that task - level search trail recommendations will provide useful guidance to novice searchers . Second , we proposed a method for search trail generation using Markov chains and evaluated the method experimentally . The results suggested that Markov chains were useful tools for Internet information source sequence modeling and search trail analysis . Third , the most innovative feature of this study is that it recommended search trails based on CBR searching . Employing CBR searching represents a new research idea that may benefit research on Internet information recommendations for complex or exploratory search tasks . The results of this study are also important for search engines and search assistance service designers . Our findings suggested that search trail recommendations incorporated into SERPs and certain webpage can help novice searchers . Most novice searchers reported good experiences interacting with the trails provided , and some even indicated that the search trail recommendations potentially improved their search skills . The information search trail recommendation method proposed in this study can provide a reference to improve network information organization and management , information recommendation services , and improve the utilization efficiency of professional or domain Internet sources .

First , the Markov chain model currently used to identify search trails is limited in terms of the amount of training data required and dimensionality with Internet sources categories classified in this study . In the future , more work needs to be done to extend the method to all Internet information sources . Second , the use of a CBR approach in the search trail recommendation may also have adverse effects . The knowledge structures activated in the searcher’s mind by the provided case may hinder their access to other areas of the solution space ( Althuizen & Wierenga , 2014 ) . In addition , this study covered a limited number of task features . Considering the various features that might exist in the actual CBR process , we will enrich features more comprehensively in the next study . We have shown the important promise of our approach in supporting some important dimensions of search performance ( i . e . , develop a search strategy , select the type , and number of sources ) . However , we also need to evaluate the effectiveness of these recommendations with different evaluation criteria , such as relevance , topic coverage , and topic diversity of the search trail recommendations . What we can infer from the search interaction log data is limited ; however , our approach has provided insight on how to organize expert searchers’ trails experience and how to generate and represent search - task relevant search trail recommendations on the SERPs and certain webpages . To provide more accurate and efficient information search trail recommendations , in the future , we intend to conduct large - scale user studies that consider and evaluate task and searcher characteristics , as well as Internet sources and queries .
