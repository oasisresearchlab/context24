Significance Statement Approximately 12 , 000 premature infants develop IVH every year in the United States , and a large number of survivors with IVH develop cerebral palsy and cognitive deficits . The onset of IVH induces inflammation of the periventricular white matter , which results in arrested maturation of OPCs and myelination failure . HA is a major component of the extracellular matrix of the brain , which regulates inflammation through CD44 and TLR2 / 4 receptors . Here , we show two mechanism - based strategies that effec - tively enhanced myelination and neurological recovery in preterm rabbit model of IVH . First , degrading HA by hyaluronidase treatment reduced CD44 and TLR4 expression , proinflammatory cytokines , and microglial infiltration , as well as promoted oligodendrocyte maturation and myelination . Second , intraventricular injection of HA oligosaccharide reduced inflammation and enhanced myelination , conceivably by depleting HC – HA levels . 872 • TheJournalofNeuroscience , January20 , 2016 • 36 ( 3 ) : 872 – 889 godendrocyte precursor cells ( OPCs ) , and reduced myelination ( Buser et al . , 2012 ) . HA inhibits OPC maturation and myelina - tion in animal models of demyelinating brain lesions and in cell culture experiments ( Preston et al . , 2013 ) . Therefore , we asked whether the development of IVH in preterm infants would result in accumulation of a specific modification of HA in the periven - tricular white matter and whether breakdown of HA by hyal - uronidase treatment or reversing specific modification of HA would restore myelination and neurological function in infants with IVH . HAisanegativelychargedglycosaminoglycanpolymer , which accumulates in the white matter lesions of premature infants , adult stroke , multiple sclerosis , traumatic spinal cord injury , and vanishing white matter disease ( Struve et al . , 2005 ; Al’Qteishat et al . , 2006 ; Cargill et al . , 2012 ) . HA fragments of low molecular weight ( LMW ) andhighmolecularweight ( HMW ) exhibitawide range of biological functions . HMW species can be immunosup - pressive , antiangiogenic , and protective , whereas LMW HA frag - ments can be proinflammatory and angiogenic ( Stern et al . , 2006 ) . Nonetheless , HMW HA ( (cid:2) 0 . 9 (cid:3) 10 6 Da ) inhibits remy - elination in a mouse model of lysolecithin - induced white matter demyelination , but not LWM HA ( (cid:2) 3 (cid:3) 10 5 Da ) ( Back et al . , 2005 ) . HA interacts with CD44 and TLR2 / 4 receptors , which are predominantly expressed on astrocytes and OPCs ( Sloane et al . , 2010 ; Buser et al . , 2012 ) . TLR2 / 4 receptors are activated in cere - bral ischemia , trauma , hemorrhage , and infection ( Konat et al . , 2006 ; Fischer and Ehlers , 2008 ; Rivest , 2009 ) , and inhibition of TLR2 / 4 offers neuroprotection in several adult rodent models of brain injury ( Lehnardt et al . , 2007 ; Tang et al . , 2007 ) . CD44 levels are chronically elevated in demyelinating lesions of multiple scle - rosis , and antagonizing CD44 promotes remyelination and neu - rological recovery ( Tuohy et al . , 2004 ; Guan et al . , 2011 ) . Hence , specific fragments of HA can induce white matter injury , which can potentially be reversed by degrading HA or by blocking its binding receptors . IVH in premature newborns induces inflammation , and COX2 or TNF (cid:2) inhibition alleviates inflammation and promotes myelinationalongwithneurologicalrecoveryinrabbitswithIVH ( Vinukonda et al . , 2010 ) . Proinflammatory cytokines have been shown to induce expression of tumor necrosis factor - stimulated gene - 6 ( TSG - 6 ) in inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and sepsis ( Milner and Day , 2003 ) . TSG - 6 catalyzes the covalent transfer of heavy chains ( HCs ) from inter - (cid:2) trypsin in - hibitor ( I (cid:2) I ) proteoglycan to HA to form HC – HA complexes ( Milner and Day , 2003 ) . HC – HA complexes exhibit proinflam - matory activity by promoting adhesion of leukocytes to HA ma - trices and by extravasation of leukocytes into the interstitial spaces ( Zhuo et al . , 2006 ) . HA oligosaccharides of 8 – 21 mono - saccharides ( (cid:2) 1 . 5 kDa ) have been used to remove the HCs from HC – HA complexes , thereby reducing the concentration of path - ological HC – HA ( Lauer et al . , 2013b ) . HA oligosaccharides also impede HA – CD44 interaction by inducing CD44 receptor cleav - age and by competitive binding to CD44 ( Sugahara et al . , 2003 ; Teriete et al . , 2004 ) . Indeed , HA oligosaccharide treatment offers neuroprotection in a mouse model of experimental allergic en - cephalitis ( Winkler et al . , 2013 ) . Although HA and myelination have been studied in adult animal models of demyelination , the dynamics of HA synthesis and degradation and the effect of HA on myelination have not been evaluated in a developmental model of brain injury in pre - mature newborns . Therefore , we hypothesized that IVH would result in the accumulation of specific fragments of HA and that degradation of HA by hyaluronidase treatment might reduce in - flammation and restore OPC maturation and myelination in pre - term survivors of IVH . We also postulated that TSG - 6 activity is increased in IVH , resulting in increased production of patholog - ical HC – HA , and that eliminating HCs from HC – HA com - plexes by treatment with HA oligosaccharides might reduce cerebral inflammation and enhance myelination as well as clinical recovery . Materials and Methods Animals . This study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the New York Medical College ( Valhalla , NY ) . We used our well - established preterm rabbit model of glycerol - induced IVH for the study ( Chua et al . , 2009 ; Vinukonda et al . , 2010 ; Dummula et al . , 2011 ) . Briefly , we purchased timed - pregnant New Zealand white rabbits from Charles River Laboratories . We performed Cesarean sections to deliver the premature pups at embryonic day 29 ( E29 ; full term , 32 d ) . Newborn pups were reared in an infant incubator at a temperature of 35°C . We used puppy formula ( Zoologic ) to gavage feed the pups in a volumeof (cid:2) 2mlevery12h ( 100ml / kg / d ) forthefirst2d , andfeedswere advanced to 125 , 150 , 200 , 250 and 280 ml / kg at postnatal day 3 ( P3 ) , P5 , P7 , P10 , and P14 , respectively . We treated rabbit pups of either sex with 50 % intraperitonealglycerol ( 6 . 5gm / kg ) at3hofagetoinduceIVH ( Fig . 1 ) . Severity of IVH was determined by measuring ventricle volume by head ultrasound at 24 h age using an Acuson Sequoia C256 ( Siemens ) ultrasound machine . Pups were classified as moderate ( 30 – 150 mm 3 ) and severe ( 151 – 250 mm 3 ) IVH , based on ventricular volume . Ventric - ular volume of (cid:4) 30 mm 3 indicated microscopic or no IVH . Hyaluronidase and HA oligosaccharide ( 10 monosaccharide unit ) treat - ment . The rabbit pups with IVH were sequentially treated with either 20 (cid:3) l of hyaluronidase from Streptomyces hyalurolyticus ( hyaluronidase , 1 U / (cid:3) l ; Sigma ) or vehicle ( saline ) intracerebroventricularly at days 2 , 4 , and 6 . Briefly , the pups were mounted on a rabbit pup restrainer after anesthetizing them with ketamine and xylazine . A 50 (cid:3) l Hamilton sy - ringe with a 27 gauge needle was mounted on a micromanipulator to inject the hyaluronidase into the lateral ventricle . We used the following coordinates from bregma : 1 mm anterior , 4 mm lateral , and 3 mm deep . Thedoseofhyaluronidasewascalculatedbasedonitsprevioususeinratstotreatspinalcordandcerebralinjuryandinourinitialexperiments , showing major reduction in HA after hyaluronidase treatment . The se - verity of IVH , measured by ultrasound , was similar between the compar - ison groups . In another set of experiments , HA oligosaccharide ( 10 monosaccharide unit ; Hyalose ) in a dose of 10 (cid:3) g or vehicle ( saline ) was injected into each of the two lateral ventricles , in the same fashion as the hyaluronidase . Human subjects . The Research Administration of New York Medical College ( Valhalla , NY ) approved the use of autopsy brain samples from premature infants for this study . The postmortem materials included forebrain tissue harvested from premature infants [ 23 – 27 gestational weeks ( gw ) ] with and without IVH of (cid:4) 5 d of postnatal age and (cid:4) 18 h postmortem ( Table 1 ) . We excluded premature infants with hypoxic - ischemic encephalopathy , meningitis , culture proven sepsis , major brain malformation , and chromosomal defects . In this study , we described intermediate zone embryonic white matter syn - onymously with white matter , and cerebral cortex for the cortical plate ( Bystron et al . , 2008 ) . Immunohistochemistry . Approximately 3 - mm - thick coronal slices at the head of caudate nucleus from human brains and 2 - mm - thick slices taken at the level of the midseptal nucleus from rabbit forebrains were processed and immunolabeled as described previously ( Dummula et al . , 2011 ) . The primary antibodies used in experiments included rabbit hya - luronan synthase ( HAS ) 1 ( HAS1 ; AIVA System Biology ) , mouse HAS2 ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , rabbit HAS3 ( AIVA System Biology ) , mouse l caspase 3 ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) , goat Ki67 ( Cell Marque ) , CorrespondenceshouldbeaddressedtoDr .

Western blot analyses . Western blot analyses were performed as de - scribed previously ( Ballabh et al . , 2007 ) . Briefly , homogenates made from brain slice taken at the level of the midseptal nucleus were quanti - fied for protein using a BCA protein assay kit ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . Equal amounts of protein ( 10 – 20 (cid:3) g ) were loaded onto 4 – 15 % or 4 – 20 % gradient precast gels ( Bio - Rad ) , depending on the molecular weight of the target protein . Separated proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes by electrotransfer . Membranes were incubated overnight with primary antibodies and target proteins were detected with an ECL system by using secondary antibodies conju - gatedwithhorseradishperoxidase ( JacksonImmunoresearch ) . Theblots from each experiment were run two to three times and were densito - metrically analyzed using ImageJ . Optical density values were normal - ized to (cid:4) actin .

Agarose gel electrophoresis was performed on 2 mm coronal slices taken from the forebrain at the level of the midseptal nucleus , based on a previous de - scription ( Lauer et al . , 2009 ) . Size exclusion chromatography . Briefly , HA was extracted from rabbit brains by proteinase K digestion and purified by ethanol precipita - tion . Nucleic acids were subsequently digested with Benzonase ( EMD Millipore ) and purified by ethanol precipitation . Chromatography columns were packed with Sephacryl S - 1000 and equilibrated in 0 . 5 M ammonium acetate . Calibration was accomplished by running 2500 , 1000 , 500 , 250 , 100 , and 10 kDa Select - HA standards ( Hyalose ) on the columns . The mobile phase was pumped at 0 . 5 ml / min , collecting 1 ml fractions in borosilicate tubes in an automated fraction collector . An aliquot of each fraction was lyophilized to dryness , resuspended in 0 . 1 M ammonium acetate , pH 7 . 0 , and digested with Streptomyces hyaluronidase overnight at 37°C . The samples were then lyophilized to dryness , labeled with 2 - aminoacridone , and incubated overnight at 37°C . The samples were analyzed by electrophoresis and the bands quantified using Image J software , as described previously ( Lauer et al . , 2013a ) .

Gene expression was performed by real time PCR on coro - nal slices taken from forebrain at the level of the midseptal nucleus , as described previously ( Ballabh et al . , 2007 ) . The nucleotide sequence of primersusedforRT - qPCRusingSYBRgreenandTaqManchemistryare described in Table 2 . Statisticsandanalysis . Dataareexpressedasmeans (cid:6) SEM . Forstudiesin rabbits , the expression of MBP , MAG , CNPase , and GFAP and cell counts were compared between three groups [ no IVH , vehicle - treated , and hya - luronidase - or HA oligosaccharide of 10 monosaccharide length ( HA10 ) - treated pups ] using one - way ANOVA . HA , gene expressions of bHLH transcription factors , TNF (cid:2) , CD44 , TLR2 / 4 , interferon (cid:5) , TSG - 6 , and pro - teinlevelsofMBPwerecomparedbetweenthreegroupsatdays3and7using two - way ANOVA with repeated measures . In addition , differences in HAS1 – HAS3 expression between pups with and without IVH were com - pared at days 3 and 7 by two - way ANOVA with repeated measures . For studies on human tissues , we compared HAS1 – HAS3 , HA , CD34 , TLR2 / 4 , HC – HA , and TSG activity between infants with and without IVH in three brain regions ( cortex , white matter , and germinal matrix ) , using two - way ANOVA with repeated measures . The repeated factor was applied to the brain regions . All post hoc comparisons were done by Bonferroni’s compar - ison test at the 0 . 05 significance level . Results IVH does not affect total HA levels in preterm rabbit pups and human infants To compare HA levels between premature rabbit pups with and without IVH , we labeled coronal sections from the forebrain with hyaluronan - binding protein ( HABP ) . We found that HA was expressed throughout the gray matter , WM , and periventricular ganglionic eminence ( GE ) and that the HA expression ( HABP staining ) was comparable in these regions between pups with and without IVH at postnatal days 3 , 7 , and 14 ( Fig . 1 A ) . Double labeling of HABP with O4 and GFAP antibodies revealed that HA was predominantly expressed in the extracellular matrix , and its expression was weak to absent on O4 (cid:5) OPCs ( Fig . 1 A ) . There were focal areas of colocalization between GFAP and HA , consis - tent with the fact that astrocytes produce HA . We next quantified HA by fluorophore - assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis on rabbit forebrain homogenates , which confirmed that HA levels were similar between pups with IVH and without IVH ( glycerol treated ) at days 3 , 7 , and 14 ( Fig . 1 B ) . Importantly , intracerebro - ventricular ( ICV ) hyaluronidase treatment almost totally elimi - nated HABP binding in immunolabeled sections ( Fig . 1 A ) and reduced HA levels by more than 10 - fold in forebrain homoge - nates ( Fig . 1 B ) . Comparable HA levels between rabbits with and without IVH and its marked reduction by hyaluronidase treat - ment were further validated by ELISA ( Fig . 1 C ) . We next evaluated HA expression in the forebrain of pre - mature infants ( 23 – 27 gw ) with and without IVH ( Table 1 ) . Consistent with premature rabbits , HA expression in the GE and the adjacent WM was comparable between human infants with and without IVH ( Fig . 1 D ) . HA expression was almost absent on MAP2 (cid:5) neurons . However , HA was expressed by O4 (cid:5) OPCs and a few GFAP (cid:5) astrocytes . Quantification of HA in homogenates from the GE and periventricular WM showed a trend toward decrease only in the GEs of infants with IVH compared to controls without IVH ( Fig . 1 E ) . However , the difference was not statistically significant . To determine HA size , we purified the HA isolated from the rabbit brains and analyzed the extract by agarose gel electropho - resis . The resulting blue staining in agarose gel electrophoresis consisted of HA of molecular weight ranging from 50 – 2500 kDa Table1 .

Vinukondaetal . • HyaluronanandIntraventricularHemorrhage J . Neurosci . , January20 , 2016 • 36 ( 3 ) : 872 – 889 • 875 ( Fig . 2 A ) . Optical density measurements revealed that 500 – 1000 kDa fragments showed a trend toward reduction in pups with IVH compared to glycerol - treated controls without IVH at day 3 ( Fig . 2 B ) . However , the comparison for HA fragments was not statistically significant between pups with and without IVH at days 3 , 7 , and 14 . To validate the findings of agarose gel electro - phoresis , we performed size exclusion chromatography at days 3 and 7 , which also showed comparable levels of HA fragments between pups with and without IVH at both days 3 and 7 ( Fig . 2 E , F ) . In human infants , the distribution of HA molecular weight fragments , assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis , were comparable between neonates with and without IVH ( Fig . 2 C , D ) . Together , the data reveal that the onset of IVH does not affect total HA levels in rabbits or humans compared to controls with - out IVH . HAS2 is elevated in both humans and rabbits with IVH , but not HAS1 and HAS3 To study the dynamics of HA synthesis and degradation , we eval - uated expression of HAS1 , HAS2 , and HAS3 as well as hyaluron - idase enzymes in both preterm humans ( 23 – 27 gw ) and rabbits ( E29 ) with and without IVH . Immunolabeling of forebrain sec - tions showed that HAS2 expression was more abundant in periventricular GEs of infants with IVH compared to controls without IVH ( Fig . 3 A ) . However , HAS1 and HAS3 expression was comparable between preterm infants with and without IVH . Double labeling revealed that all three synthases were expressed abundantly on GFAP (cid:5) astrocytes , and weakly on doublecortin - positive ( DCX (cid:5) ) neurons and Olig2 (cid:5) OPCs ( HAS3 data not shown ) . Western blot analyses confirmed that HAS2 levels were higher in the GEs of preterm infants with IVH compared to con - trols without IVH ( p (cid:7) 0 . 003 ; Fig . 3 B ) , but not in the cortex or WM . HAS1 and HAS3 expressions were comparable between infants with and without IVH . In rabbits , both mRNA and protein expression of HAS1 and HAS3 in the forebrain were comparable between pups with and without IVH at days 3 and 7 ( Fig . 4 A – E ; data on rabbit HAS3 protein levels not shown ) . While HAS2 mRNA accumulation was lower in pups with IVH compared to controls at day 3 ( p (cid:4) 0 . 03 , not at day 7 ) , protein levels were higher in the forebrain of pups with IVH relative to pups without IVH at both days 3 and 7 ( p (cid:7) 0 . 003and0 . 001 , respectively ; Fig . 4 C , D ) . Thisdifferencemightbe attributed to alteration in the post - translational modifications of HAS2 enzymes . Figure 2 .

PH20 mRNA expression could not be detected in human brains with commercially avail - able two TaqMan primers ( Invitrogen ) . Together , HAS2 en - zymes are elevated in both rabbits and humans with IVH . CD44 , TLR2 , and TLR4 are elevated in the GEs of infants with IVH Since HA fragments signal responses through CD44 and the TLR2 / 4 receptors ( Jiang et al . , 2011 ) , we assayed their expression in the forebrain of premature infants with and without IVH . Immunolabeling of forebrain sections demonstrated that CD44 expression was more abundant in the GEs of premature infants with IVH compared to controls without IVH ( Fig . 5 A ) . In addi - tion , CD44 immunoreactivity was significantly higher in the GE comparedwiththeembryonicWMandneocortexofinfantsbothwithandwithoutIVH . Double immunolabeling revealed that CD44 was expressed on GFAP (cid:5) astrocytes , O4 (cid:5) OPCs , and Iba1 (cid:5) microglia , but not on DCX (cid:5) neurons . Western blot anal - yses confirmed that CD44 levels were elevated in the GEs of in - fants with IVH relative to controls without IVH ( p (cid:4) 0 . 001 ) , but not in the neocortex or WM ( Fig . 5 B ) . We next assessed TLR2 expression in premature infants with IVH compared to controls without IVH . We noted higher immu - noreactivity of TLR2 in the GEs of premature infants with IVH than in controls without IVH ( Fig . 5 A ) . TLR2 was expressed on several Iba1 (cid:5) microglia and a few GFAP (cid:5) astrocytes , but not on Olig2 (cid:5) OPCs or DCX (cid:5) neurons . Consistent with immunohisto - chemistry , Western blot analyses showed higher levels of TLR2 in the GEs of premature infants with IVH compared to controls without IVH ( p (cid:4) 0 . 011 ; Fig . 5 B ) . Similar to TLR2 expression , TLR4 immunoreactivity was more abundant in the periventricular GEs of infants with IVH compared to controls without IVH . TLR4 was expressed on GFAP (cid:5) astrocytes , DCX (cid:5) neurons , and several O4 (cid:5) OPCs , but not on Iba1 (cid:5) microglia ( Fig . 5 A ) . TLR4 protein quantification by Western blot analyses revealed that TLR4 expression was elevated in the GEs of human infants with IVH compared to controls ( p (cid:7) 0 . 02 ; Fig . 5 B ) , but not in the WM or cortex . Together , IVH results in higher expression of HA receptors—CD44 , and TLR2 / 4—in the periventricular GE . Since all OPCs originate from GE prena - Figure3 . HAS2enzymeisupregulatedinhumanswithIVH .

Neurosci . , January20 , 2016 • 36 ( 3 ) : 872 – 889 • 877 tally to populate the white matter ( Kessaris et al . , 2006 ) , elevated expressions of CD44 and TLR2 / 4 in the GE is likely to impact production and maturation of OPCs as well as myelination of the adjacent white matter . Hyaluronidase treatment restores myelination Because HA inhibits maturation of OPCs and myelination in cell culture experiments and models of demyelination ( Back et al . , 2005 ; Sloane et al . , 2010 ) , we compared myelination among three groupsofpupsatday14 : ( 1 ) pupswithoutIVH ( glyceroltreated ) , ( 2 ) vehicle - treated pups with IVH ( glycerol treated ) , and ( 3 ) hyaluronidase - treated pups with IVH ( glycerol treated ) . To clar - ify , intraperitoneal glycerol was used to induce IVH , and ICV vehicle ( saline ) was administered for comparison with ICV hyal - uronidase . The severity of IVH was comparable between vehicle - and hyaluronidase - treated groups ( ventricular volume , 192 (cid:6) 37 mm 3 vs 189 (cid:6) 36 mm 3 for vehicle and hyalase , respectively ) , as measured by head ultrasound . Stereological analyses of MBP in immunolabeled sections demonstrated that the volume fractions ( myelin load ) of MBP in the corpus callosum and corona radiata were significantly reduced in pups with IVH relative to controls without IVH ( p (cid:4) 0 . 004 ) and that ICV hyaluronidase injection restored the expression of MBP ( p (cid:7) 0 . 049 ; Fig . 6 A ) . Accord - ingly , Western blot analyses verified that MBP and MAG levels were diminished in pups with IVH compared to controls without IVH ( p (cid:4) 0 . 001 both ) and that hyaluronidase treatment signifi - cantly increased MBP and MAG expression in pups with IVH ( both p (cid:7) 0 . 001 ; Fig . 6 B , C ) . Ultrastructural evaluation of the corpus callosum and corona radiata revealed that myelinated axons were fewer in pups with IVH compared to controls without IVH ( p (cid:4) 0 . 05 ; Fig . 6 D ) and that hyaluronidase treatment significantly amplified the number of myelinated axons in pups with IVH ( p (cid:4) 0 . 05 ) . Moreover , the g ratio was comparable in the three groups of pups ( 0 . 769 (cid:6) 0 . 01 vs 0 . 76 (cid:6) 0 . 002 vs 0 . 758 (cid:6) 0 . 012 , in pups without IVH with IVH and hyaluronidase treatment , respectively ) . This suggests that hyaluronidase treatment enhances myelination and restores mor - phology of the myelin sheath . Since myelination is abundant at day 14 in our animal model , we selected two epochs—day 7 and day 14—to assess progress in myelination in the three sets of rabbit pups . We found that MBP and MAG expressions were (cid:2) 10 - fold less at day 7 relative to day Figure4 . HAS2expressionhigherinrabbitswithIVH .

More importantly , MBP expression was comparable be - tween three groups—pups without IVH and vehicle - and hyaluronidase - treated pups with IVH—at day 7 on both immu - nohistochemistry with stereological quantification and Western blot analyses ( Fig . 6 E ) . This suggested that the process of myeli - nation was predominant during days 7 – 14 , and arrested myeli - nation in pups with IVH was restored by hyaluronidase treatment during this period . Hyaluronidase treatment does not affect astrogliosis HA accumulates in the CNS lesions , limits gliosis , and regulates gliascarformation ( Struveetal . , 2005 ; Cargilletal . , 2012 ) . There - fore , we hypothesized that hyaluronidase treatment might reduce astrogliosis in rabbit pups with IVH . However , GFAP expression was comparable between vehicle - and hyaluronidase - treated pups with IVH in the corpus callosum and corona radiata on both stereological quantification of immuolabeled sections and Western blot analyses ( Fig . 7 A , B ) . Since hyaluronidase treatment enhanced myelination in pups with IVH , we reasoned that this might affect myelination or gli - osis in healthy pups . To this end , we compared MBP and GFAP levels in the vehicle - and hyaluronidase - treated healthy pups at day 14 ( data not shown ) . We found that hyaluronidase treatment did not significantly affect myelination or astrogliosis in healthy pups without IVH . ICV hyaluronidase promotes maturation of OPC and enhances transcription of Olig1 , Olig2 , and MBP genes Since HA inhibits OPC maturation ( Back et al . , 2005 ; Sloane et al . , 2010 ) , we postulated that hyaluronidase treatment might affect proliferation and maturation of OPCs . To assess prolif - eration of OPCs in the corona radiata and corpus callosum , we compared ( 1 ) pups without IVH ( glycerol treated ) , ( 2 ) vehicle - treated pups with IVH , and ( 3 ) hyaluronidase - treated pups with IVH for cycling ( Ki67 (cid:5) ) and total OPCs— PDGFR (cid:2) (cid:5) and Olig2 (cid:5) —at day 3 . Severity of IVH was similar between vehicle - and hyaluronidase - treated groups ( ventric - ular volume , 197 (cid:6) 38 mm 3 vs 190 (cid:6) 31 mm 3 for vehicle - and hyalase - treated pups , respectively ) . The densities of total PDGFR (cid:2) (cid:5) cells were similar between the three sets of pups ( Fig . 8 A ) . However , the cycling PDGFR (cid:2) (cid:5) cells were reduced Figure5 .

Both total and cycling Olig2 cells showed a trend toward de - cline in pups with IVH compared to controls without IVH at day 3 , and hyaluronidase treatment did not significantly affect their density ( Fig . 8 B ) . We next evaluated the effect of hyaluronidase treatment on OPC maturation . We found that the population of O4 (cid:5) APC (cid:5) cells was significantly reduced in pups with IVH relative to con - trols without IVH ( p (cid:4) 0 . 001 ) , and hyaluronidase treatment significantly increased the density of O4 (cid:5) APC (cid:5) OPCs ( p (cid:4) 0 . 001 ) in the corona radiata and corpus callosum ( Fig . 8 C ) . This suggests that hyaluronidase treatment restores the maturation of OPCs in pups with IVH . We also found that the levels of CNPase ( 2 (cid:8) , 3 (cid:8) - cyclic nucleotide - 3 (cid:8) - phosphodiesterase ) , measured by Western blot analyses , were significantly reduced in pups with IVH compared to controls ( p (cid:4) 0 . 001 ) at day 14 and that hyal - uronidase treatment restored the expression of CNPase ( p (cid:7) 0 . 001 ; Fig . 8 D ) . Together , hyaluronidase treatment favors matu - ration of OPCs . As OPC matures from the stage of specification to the termi - nal differentiation , Olig1 , Olig2 , and Sox10 transcription factors enhance maturation , whereas Id2 and Id4 have inhibitory influ - ences ( Nicolay et al . , 2007 ) . qRT - PCR revealed that mRNA ex - pressions of Olig2 and MBP were significantly reduced in pups with IVH at day 7 ( p (cid:7) 0 . 008 and (cid:4) 0 . 05 , respectively ) , and that hyaluronidase treatment significantly elevated levels of Olig1 , Olig2 , and MBP mRNA compared to vehicle controls at day 7 ( p (cid:4) 0 . 05 , 0 . 036 , and 0 . 048 , respectively ; data not shown ) . Addi - tionally , ID4 expression was elevated in pups with IVH ( p (cid:7) 0 . 036 ) , and hyaluronidase treatment reduced its level ( p (cid:4) 0 . 001 ) .

Hyaluronidase treatment suppresses proinflammatory cytokines , microglial infiltration , and HA receptors HA and its binding receptors regulate transcription of inflamma - tory genes , recruitment of inflammatory cells , and release of cytokines ( Petrey and de la Motte , 2014 ) . Therefore , we assessed theeffectofhyaluronidasetreatmentonIVH - inducedinflamma - tion .

We next quantified mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines , including TNF (cid:2) , IL - 1 (cid:4) , and (cid:5) interferon , by qRT - PCR ( TaqMan probes ) . We noted that both TNF (cid:2) and IL - 1 (cid:4) expression were elevated in pups with IVH compared to con - trols at day 3 ( p (cid:7) 0 . 017 and 0 . 02 , respectively ) , but not at day 7 . Importantly , hyaluronidase treatment reduced their expres - sion ( p (cid:7) 0 . 009 and 0 . 015 , respectively ; Fig . 9 C ) . (cid:5) - interferon levels were comparable between rabbits with and without IVH . We then assayed mRNA expression of CD44 and TLR2 / 4 receptors by qRT - PCR ( TaqMan probes ) . We found that CD44 gene expression was elevated in pups with IVH com - pared with controls at both days 3 and 7 ( both p (cid:4) 0 . 001 ; Fig . 9 D ) , and hyaluronidase treatment reduced CD44 levels at both days ( p (cid:7) 0 . 006 and 0 . 03 , respectively ) . TLR2 and TLR4 mRNA expressions were also elevated in pups with IVH rela - tive to controls at day 3 ( p (cid:4) 0 . 001 and 0 . 002 , respectively ; Fig . 9 D ) , but not at day 7 . Importantly , hyaluronidase treatment significantly reduced TLR4 expression ( p (cid:7) 0 . 005 ) , but not TLR2 expression .

Hyaluronidase administration restores neurological recovery We next performed neurobehavioral evaluations of three sets of preterm pups at day 14 ( Table 3 ) , as described previously ( Chua et al . , 2009 ) . Vehicle - and hyaluronidase - treated groups were balanced with respect to the severity of IVH ( ven - tricular volume , 195 (cid:6) 27 mm 3 vs 187 (cid:6) 26 mm 3 for vehicle and hyalase , respectively ) . We found significant weakness in the hind legs of three vehicle - treated pups , with IVH manifest - ing as clumsiness in the gait , whereas none of the pups in hyaluronidase - treated or healthy control group ( no IVH ) showed any evidence of weakness in the legs . The scores for gait were significantly higher in hyaluronidase - treated pups than in vehicle controls ( p (cid:4) 0 . 05 ) . The average distance walked in 60 s was farther in hyaluronidase - treated pups com - pared with vehicle controls ( p (cid:7) 0 . 04 ) . The percentage of pups showing an inability to hold their position on a ramp pitched at 60° inclination for 15 s or longer was more in hyaluronidase - treated pups compared to saline controls ( 0 vs 33 % ) . Scores for the righting reflex were significantly better in hyaluronidase - treated pups compared to vehicle - treated controls ( p (cid:4) 0 . 05 ) . There was no difference in sensory and cranial nerve assessment of the three sets of rabbit pups . Im - portantly , we did not observe any apparent adverse effect at - tributable to hyaluronidase treatment among pups with IVH receiving this medication . IVH induces TSG - 6 activity and synthesis of HC – HA complexes TSG - 6 expression is upregulated in response to proinflammatory mediators , and this catalyzes the covalent transfer of HCs from I (cid:2) I to HA to produce a pathological form of HA ( HC – HA com - plex ; Milner and Day , 2003 ; Colo´n et al . , 2009 ) .

Aliquots of forebrain homoge - nates were treated with hyaluronidase and incubated for 30 min at4°C , followedby30minincubationat37°C , toreleaseHCfrom HC – HA complexes . Western blot analyses on these homogenates using I (cid:2) I antibody showed that the HC – HA ( 85 kDa ) levels were higher in the GEs of preterm infants with IVH compared to con - trols without IVH ( p (cid:7) 0 . 005 ; Fig . 10 A , B ) . HC – HA levels in the WM showed a trend toward increase in infants with IVH com - pared to controls . We next evaluated endogenous TSG - 6 activity in the brain extracts by adding HA oligosaccharide ( 14 monosaccharides ) . Endogenous TSG - 6 activity was indicated by an appearance of a HC band ( 85 kDa ) , which was formed by transfer of HCs from I (cid:2) I onto HA oligosaccharide . Positive controls were made by addition of exogenous TSG - 6 to the brain extract , which led to formation of a strong 85 kDa band ( Fig . 10 C ) , indicating the suitability of experimental conditions to assess TSG - 6 activity . We found an increased TSG - 6 activity ( elevated 85 kDa HC ) in the GEs of infants with IVH compared to controls without IVH ( p (cid:7) 0 . 025 ; Fig . 10 C , D ) , but not in the WM . Together , the data demonstrate greater abundance of HC – HA complexes and TSG - 6 activity in the GEs of infants with IVH compared to con - trols without IVH . TSG - 6 transfers HC from I (cid:2) I to HA in a reversible manner . However , transfer of HC to HA oligosaccharides ( 8 – 21 oligosac - charide units ) is an irreversible event . We have demonstrated the utility of this observation by irreversibly swapping HCs from HC – HA onto a HA oligosaccharide in the synovial fluid of pa - tients with rheumatoid arthritis , thereby restoring the patholog - ical HC – HA matrices to their normal state ( Lauer et al . , 2013b ) . Accordingly , aliquots of homogenates made from GEs of infants withIVHwereincubatedat37°CwithHA10 ( 10monosaccharide units ) for 24 or 72 h . Adding exogenous recombinant TSG - 6 resulted in a smear above 250 kDa ( Fig . 10 , lane 4 ) , indicating transfer of HCs from I (cid:2) I to HA , forming the HC – HA complex .

Neurosci . , January20 , 2016 • 36 ( 3 ) : 872 – 889 • 883 nant TSG - 6 to the brain extract ( lane 5 ) led to an intense 85 kDa band , which indicated swapping of the HCs from HC – HA com - plex onto the HA10 oligosaccharide . Collectively , use of HA10 holds promise in removal of HC from pathological HA in pre - term infants and possibly in rabbits with IVH . We next assessed TSG - 6 mRNA expressions in preterm rabbit pups with and without IVH at days 3 and 7 . We found that TSG - 6 gene expression was significantly higher in pups with IVH com - pared to controls without IVH at P3 ( p (cid:7) 0 . 009 ; Fig . 10 G ) , but not at P7 . Accordingly , immunolabeling showed that TSG - 6 was more abundantly expressed in GE and WM of rabbits with IVH compared to controls without IVH ( data not shown ) . Together , the data suggest that TSG - 6 expression is upregulated in subjects with IVH , which induces generation of HC – HA complexes in the brain . ICV HA oligosaccharide administration reduces inflammation and promotes myelination Because HC – HA complexes exhibit proinflammatory activity , we postulated that removal of HCs from the HC – HA com - plexes might reduce inflammation and restore myelination in rabbit pups with IVH . Since HA oligosaccharides are irrevers - ible HC acceptors , unlike high molecular weight HA , we com - pared ( 1 ) pups without IVH ( glycerol treated ) , ( 2 ) pups vehicle treated with IVH , and ( 3 ) HA10 - treated pups with IVH for microglial density and proinflammatory cytokines . Vehicle was administered intracerebroventricularly , just as HA10 . We found that the densities of both Iba1 (cid:5) and CD11b (cid:5) microglia in the periventricular WM were higher in the pups with IVH compared to controls without IVH at day 3 ( p (cid:7) 0 . 01 and 0 . 001 , respectively ) , and HA oligosaccharide treat - ment reduced their number in pups with IVH ( p (cid:7) 0 . 015 and 0 . 001 , respectively ; Fig . 11 A , B ) . Accordingly , TNF (cid:2) and IL1 (cid:4) mRNA accumulation were higher in the pups with IVH com - pared to glycerol controls ( p (cid:4) 0 . 001 and 0 . 004 , respectively ) , and HA oligosaccharide treatment reduced their levels in pups with IVH at day 3 ( p (cid:7) 0 . 001 and 0 . 036 , respectively ; Fig . 11 C ) . HA oligosaccharide also reduced TLR4 expression in pups with IVH at day 3 ( p (cid:4) 0 . 01 ) , but not CD44 and TLR2 expression ( Fig . 11 D ) . Hence , HA oligosaccharide administra - tion appears to alleviate inflammation by reducing microglial infiltration , proinflammatory cytokines , and TLR4 levels . We next evaluated the effect of HA oligosaccharide treatment on myelination and astrogliosis . Stereological quantification of immunolabeled sections revealed that the volume fractions ( my - elin load ) of MBP in the corpus callosum and corona radiata were significantlyhigherinHAoligosaccharide - treatedpupswithIVH relative to vehicle controls with IVH ( p (cid:7) 0 . 014 ; Fig . 12 A ) . West - ern blot analyses demonstrated that all three—MBP , MAG , and CNPase—levels were higher in HA oligosaccharide - treated pups with IVH compared to vehicle controls with IVH ( all p (cid:4) 0 . 001 ; Fig . 12 B – D ) . Moreover , GFAP expression—measured by stereo - logical quantification and Western blot analysis—was similar be - tween HA oligosaccharide and vehicle - treated pups with IVH ( Fig . 12 E ) . Together , the data demonstrate that HA oligosaccha - ride treatment enhances myelination without significantly inhib - iting astrogliosis . HA oligosaccharide treatment promotes neurological recovery We performed neurobehavioral evaluations on the three sets of preterm pups at day 14 : ( 1 ) pups without IVH ( glycerol treated ) , ( 2 ) vehicle - treated pups with IVH , and ( 3 ) HA oligosaccharide - treated pups with IVH ( Table 4 ) . The three groups were similar with respect to the severity of IVH ( 179 (cid:6) 27 vs 172 (cid:6) 17 mm 3 for HA10 and vehicle , respectively ) , as quantified by head ultrasound . We found that one kit in the vehicle - treated group had weakness in all four extremities and was not able to walk at all . In addition , three pups in this group had significant weakness in the hind legs manifesting as clum - siness and asymmetry in the gait . In the HA oligosaccharide - treated pups , one pup had significant weakness in the back legs . Conversely , none of the pups in the glycerol - treated control ( no IVH ) group exhibited significant weakness in the fore or hind legs . The scores for gait and movement of the hind leg were significantly higher in HA oligosaccharide - treated pups than in saline controls ( p (cid:4) 0 . 05 ) . The average dist - ance walked in 60 s was farther in HA oligosaccharide - treated pups compared with vehicle controls ( 114 (cid:6) 17 vs 89 . 1 (cid:6) 12 . 2 inches ) . There was no difference in sensory and cranial nerve assessments of the three sets of rabbit pups . Overall , HA oligosaccharide - treated pups performed superior on neurobehavioral scoring compared with vehicle controls .

Moreimportantly , wedemonstratedthattwo therapeutic strategies enhanced myelination and clinical recov - ery in rabbits with IVH . First , digestion of HA by ICV hyaluron - idase treatment reduced CD44 and TLR4 expression , microglia infiltration , and proinflammatory cytokines , and enhanced my - elination in rabbits with IVH . Second , ICV HA oligosaccharide reduced inflammation and enhanced myelination , conceivably via irreversible HC transfer from pathological HC – HA to the HA oligosaccharide . The most important finding of the present study was that hyaluronidase treatment removed HA from the forebrain and restored myelination and clinical recovery in preterm rabbits with IVH . Specifically , we demonstrated that hyaluronidase treatment ( 1 ) reduced microglia infiltration , proinflammatory cytokine levels , and CD44 and TLR4 expression ; ( 2 ) reversed maturational arrest of OPCs , ( 3 ) induced transcription of Olig1 , Olig2 , and MBP genes favoring myelination ; and , thus , ( 4 ) pro - motedmyelinationandneurologicalrecoveryinadevelopmental rabbit model of IVH - induced WM injury . Hence , restoration of OPC maturation after hyaluronidase treatment was seemingly mediated by two interwoven signaling cascades , including reduc - tion in levels of HA and CD44 ( inflammation independent ) and suppression of inflammation ( inflammation dependent ) . Cell culture experiments have demonstrated that HA blocks OPC maturation ( Marret et al . , 1994 ; Back et al . , 2005 ) , and studies in an adult rodent model have shown that HMW HA accumulation in chronic lesions of demyelination inhibits OPC maturation ( Back et al . , 2005 ) . Intriguingly , mice engineered to overexpress CD44 also exhibit inflammation - independent demyelination ( Tuohy et al . , 2004 ) . Moreover , our previous study showed that suppression of inflammation by COX2 inhibition or TNF (cid:2) downregulation promotes myelination in this animal model ( Vinukonda et al . , 2010 ) . Other than in the brain , hyaluronidase PH20 also inhibits lipopolysaccharide induced neutrophil and macrophage recruitment in an air pouch model of inflammation ( Huang et al . , 2014 ) . These studies reinforce our notion that hyaluronidase treatment promotes OPC maturation and myeli - Figure10 . IVHinducesTSG - 6activityandsynthesisofHC – HAcomplexes .

A seminal observation made in this study was an elevation in TSG - 6expressionandanabundanceofHC – HAcomplexesinthe forebrainsofsubjectswithIVH . Moreimportantly , wefoundthat HA10 treatment to aliquots of fore brain homogenates ( autopsy samples from preterm infants ) eliminated HC from pathologi - cal HC – HA complexes . Although we could not demonstrate HC – HA complexes in rabbits with IVH in the absence of a suit - able antibody , HA10 treatment to remove HC suppressed in - flammation and enhanced myelination as well as neurologic outcome of pups with IVH . Little is known about the function of TSG - 6 activity and HC – HA complexes . TSG - 6 production is in - duced by proinflammatory mediators including TNF (cid:2) , IL - 1 (cid:4) , and prostaglandin E2 , and it catalyzes transfer of HCs from inter - (cid:2) - inhibitor onto HA to form the pathological HC – HA complex ( Milner and Day , 2003 ) . TSG - 6 is also considered to exhibit anti - inflammatory and cytoprotective effects ( Watanabe et al . , 2013 ; Zhang et al . , 2013 ; Kim et al . , 2014 ) . However , HC – HA com - plexes promote inflammation by causing adhesion of HA to the CD44 on the neutrophil cell surface and increase their extravasa - tion into the interstitial tissues ( Zhuo et al . , 2006 ) . An increase in TSG - 6 expression and elevated HC – HA complex have been re - ported in lung tissues of humans with idiopathic pulmonary hy - pertension ( Lauer et al . , 2014 ) and in the synovial fluid of a mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis ( Lauer et al . , 2013b ) . HA oligosaccharide treatment has been used in a mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis to irreversibly remove HC from HC – HA , thereby reducing joint inflammation ( Lauer et al . , 2013b ) . How - ever , HC – HA complexes have not been evaluated in any devel - opmental model of hypomyelination or in animal models of demyelination , andthisisthefirstreporttoassesstheeffectofHA oligosaccharide treatment on cerebral inflammation , myelina - tion , and neurological outcomes in a developmental model of brain injury . Hence , elimination of HCs from HC – HA com - plexes in the survivors of IVH could be a novel strategy to en - hance myelination of the WM and restore neurological function . HA oligosaccharides seem to inhibit inflammation and pro - mote myelination by a number of mechanisms . HA oligosaccha - rides can interfere with HA – CD44 interactions by inducing CD44 receptor cleavage or by competitive binding to CD44 ( Sugahara et al . , 2003 ; Teriete et al . , 2004 ) . However , CD44 ex - pression was unchanged after HA10 treatment in our model . HA oligosaccharide ( HA12 ) impairs activated lymphocyte rolling on Figure11 .

Moreover , HA12 limits demyeli - nation in a mouse model of experimental autoimmune enceph - alitis ( Winkler et al . , 2013 ) . Hence , HA10 oligosaccharide treatment might be alleviating IVH - induced inflammation by removing HC from pathological HA , competitive binding of CD44 , and displacing HA from the CD44 receptor . HA accrues in brain lesions of premature infants with WM injury , adult stroke , multiple sclerosis , traumatic spinal cord in - jury , and vanishing WM disease ( Back et al . , 2005 ; Struve et al . , 2005 ; Al’Qteishatetal . , 2006 ; Sloaneetal . , 2010 ; Buseretal . , 2012 ; Cargill et al . , 2012 ) . Increased levels of HA have been noted in CSF of adult patients with vascular dementia , meningoencepha - litis , spinal stenosis , head injury , cerebral infarction , hydroceph - alus , and encephalitis ( Laurent et al . , 1996 ; Na¨gga et al . , 2014 ) . Surprisingly , we did not find an increase in HA levels in infants with IVH , despite large IVH inducing extensive GFAP (cid:5) gliosis in the periventricular region . Importantly , hyaluronidase treatment in rabbits with IVH degraded HA into (cid:4) 100 kDa fragments and alleviated inflammation as well as promoted myelination . Con - sistent with our study , neither recombinant human PH20 nor its generated LMW HA fragment stimulated an acute inflammatory response , but inhibited lipopolysaccharide - induced neutrophil recruitment in the air pouch model of inflammation ( Huang et al . , 2014 ) . In contrast , LMW HA has induced inflammation via TLR2 / 4 signaling in a mouse model of lung injury ( Noble et al . , 1996 ) . We attribute the differences in the findings between the studies to differences in the specific size of HA fragment used and the organ system under study , experimental context , and in vitro versus in vivo type experiments . It is possible that small HA frag - ments produced by hyaluronidase treatment might be alleviating inflammation and promoting myelination , similar to HA10 treatment . Hyaluronidase treatment in infants with IVH seems promis - ing . However , this might result in behavioral changes and adverse effects . HA modulates AMPA receptor mobility , paired - pulse de - pression , L - type voltage - dependent Ca 2 (cid:5) channel activity , and long - term potentiation ( Kochlamazashvili et al . , 2010 ) . It re - duces contextual fear conditioning and might induce epilepti - form activity ( Vedunova et al . , 2013 ) . Since HMW HA inhibits Figure12 . HA10treatmentrestoresmyelination .

Importantly , intra - thecal and ICV hyaluronidase have been used in children and adults with tuberculous meningitis and hydrocephalus in devel - oping countries , demonstrating clinical efficacy and safety of in - trathecal hyaluronidase treatment ( Gourie - Devi and Satish , 1984 ; Bhagwati and George , 1986 ; Gourie - Devi and Satishchan - dra , 1991 ) . However , the safety and efficacy of ICV hyaluronidase needs confirmation in infants and children by performing a ran - domized controlled clinical trial . In conclusion , the development of IVH in preterm human infants and rabbit pups did not affect total HA concentration in the forebrain tissues , but activated HA receptors CD44 and TLR2 as well as TLR4 receptors , thereby inducing microglia infiltration and elevation in proinflammatory cytokines . There was an asso - ciated increase in TSG - 6 activity and the accumulation of HC – HA complexes . Two therapeutic interventions—hyaluron - idase treatment to degrade HA and the removal of HCs from HC – HA complexes by HA oligosaccharides—reduced inflam - mation and enhanced OPC maturation , myelination , and neuro - logical recovery in preterm rabbits with IVH . These treatments involved ICV injection , which could be traumatic , risky , and cumbersome for use in human preterm infants . However , con - sidering the high incidence of neurodevelopmental sequelae in infants with IVH and more invasive clinical trials performed on these infants ( Whitelaw et al . , 2010 ) , intraventricular hyaluroni - dase might be considered for clinical trial in infants with moder - ate to severe IVH . Certainly , there is a need for more information on the adverse effects and pharmacokinetics of these agents . If treatment with hyaluronidase or HA oligosaccharides demon - strates efficacy and safety in preventing WM injury in premature infants , it could improve the neurologic outcome of premature infants with IVH .
