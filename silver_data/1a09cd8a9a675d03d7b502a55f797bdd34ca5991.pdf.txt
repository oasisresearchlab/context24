Vol . 216 No . 4 1107 – 1121 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1083 / jcb . 201609066 Introduction AMP - activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) is a serine / threonine kinase and a prominent metabolic sensor in cells . At the cellu - lar level , energy stress leads to the activation of AMPK , which inhibits energy - consuming anabolic pathways and triggers en - ergy - promoting catabolic pathways ( Hardie et al . , 2012 ) . Be - cause of the critical role of AMPK in metabolic regulation , this kinase has become an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of obesity , diabetes , and cancer ( Hardie , 2013 ) . Apart from its well - described role in maintaining cellular en - ergy homeostasis , AMPK regulates several other physiological processes , including cell growth , autophagy , cell polarity , de - velopment , mitosis , and transcription ( Zhang et al . , 2006 ; Lee et al . , 2007 ; Nakano et al . , 2010 ; Banko et al . , 2011 ; Mihaylova and Shaw , 2011 ; Schaffer et al . , 2015 ) . In a screen performed recently in human cancer cell lines , many newly identified AMPK substrates consisted of proteins involved in cell motil - ity , adhesion , and invasion ( Schaffer et al . , 2015 ) . Nevertheless , the role of AMPK in cell adhesion and mechanotransduction remains largely underexplored . Integrins are transmembrane receptors that mediate cell – matrix interactions , with key functions in cell adhesion , mi - gration , and mechanotransduction . Integrins are heterodimers , consisting of an α and a β subunit , and exist at the plasma mem - brane in either the bent ( inactive ) conformation or the extended ( active ) conformation ( Hynes , 2002 ) . Integrin binding to ECM ligands promotes conformational changes within the receptor that favor integrin activation in a process called outside - in sig - naling . Alternatively , several proteins bound to the intracellular part of integrins regulate receptor conformation and thus activ - ity via so - called inside - out activation ( Kim et al . , 2011 ) . Talins and kindlins are both well - described integrin activators , which bind the cytoplasmic tail of β - integrins ( Calderwood et al . , 2013 ) . Conversely , other proteins , such as SHA RPIN , DOK - 1 , ICAP1 , and filamin , inhibit integrin activation by directly or in - directly disrupting the integrin – talin interaction ( Bouvard et al . , 2013 ) . One family of proteins , known as tensins , bind integrins at a region overlapping with the talin - binding site ( McCleverty et al . , 2007 ) , yet the role of this family in influencing integrin inside - out activation has not been investigated . We found that the major metabolic sensor AMPK is an inhibitor of β 1 - integrin activity . Loss of AMPK promotes Tight regulation of integrin activity is paramount for dynamic cellular functions such as cell matrix adhesion and mech - anotransduction . Integrin activation is achieved through intracellular interactions at the integrin cytoplasmic tails and through integrin – ligand binding . In this study , we identify the metabolic sensor AMP - activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) as a β 1 - integrin inhibitor in fibroblasts . Loss of AMPK promotes β 1 - integrin activity , the formation of centrally located active β 1 - integrin – and tensin - rich mature fibrillar adhesions , and cell spreading . Moreover , in the absence of AMPK , cells generate more mechanical stress and increase fibronectin fibrillogenesis . Mechanistically , we show that AMPK nega - tively regulates the expression of the integrin - binding proteins tensin1 and tensin3 . Transient expression of tensins in - creases β 1 - integrin activity , whereas tensin silencing reduces integrin activity in fibroblasts lacking AMPK . Accordingly , tensin silencing in AMPK - depleted fibroblasts impedes enhanced cell spreading , traction stress , and fibronectin fiber formation . Collectively , we show that the loss of AMPK up - regulates tensins , which bind β 1 - integrins , supporting their activity and promoting fibrillar adhesion formation and integrin - dependent processes .

JCB • Volume 216 • NumBer 4 • 2017 1108 integrin activity and the formation of mature fibrillar adhesions with high levels of active α 5 β 1 - integrin and tensin . We further show that tensins can activate integrins and that AMPK inhibits β 1 - integrin activity by negatively regulating tensin levels . Con - gruently , AMPK - mediated inhibition of cell spreading , traction stress , and ECM assembly are tensin dependent . Results AMPK negatively regulates β 1 - integrin activity AMPK is a heterotrimeric protein complex consisting of the catalytic α subunit and the regulatory β and γ subunits with at least two isoforms each ( α 1 , α 2 ; β 1 , β 2 ; γ 1 , γ 2 , γ 3 ; Hardie et al . , 2012 ) . Based on quantitative proteomic analyses , AMPK is a component of the fibronectin - induced integrin adhesome , as different subunits were identified in three independent mass spectrometry – based proteomics datasets ( Schiller et al . , 2013 ; Horton et al . , 2015 ; Robertson et al . , 2015 ) . Moreover , AMPK is a putative β 1 - integrin inactivator . Indeed , in the kinome RNAi screen we performed previously ( Rantala et al . , 2011 ) , two independent siRNAs against PRK AA2 ( AMPK α 2 ) and one of two siRNAs targeting the AMPK regulatory β subunit PRK AB2 ( AMPK β 2 ) significantly increased β 1 - integrin activity . Interestingly , the regulatory γ subunit ( AMPK γ 2 ) is also asso - ciated with integrin activity , as it was identified as a putative integrin inhibitor in the druggable genomewide RNAi screen we performed in prostate cancer cells ( VCap ; Pellinen et al . , 2012 ) and as a potential adhesome component associated with inactive β 1 - integrins ( Byron et al . , 2015 ) . To validate the role of AMPK in integrin activity sug - gested by these unbiased screens , we used immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) with wild - type ( WT ) AMPK α ( α 1 + / − ; α 2 + / + ) or with nullizygous AMPK α 1 ( α 1 − / − ; α 2 + / + or α 1 - knockout [ KO ; α 1KO ] ) , AMPK α 2 ( α 1 + / − ; α 2 − / − or α 2KO ) , or both ( α 1 − / − ; α 2 − / − or KO ) , as described previously ( Yan et al . , 2015 ) . We measured cell surface active integrins by flow cytometry ( based on the binding of a recombinant integrin li - gand fragment , fibronectin repeats 7 – 10 [ FN7 – 10 ] ) relative to total cell surface β 1 - integrin ( Hughes et al . , 2002 ; Tadokoro et al . , 2003 ) and observed a modest increase in integrin ac - tivity upon the loss of one AMPK α isoform ( α 1KO or α 2KO ) and a significant increase upon the loss of both AMPK α iso - forms ( KO ) compared with WT MEFs ( Figs . 1 A and S1 A ) . Silencing of the remaining second isoform in the α 1KO or α 2KO ( si α 2 or si α 1 , respectively ; Figs . 1 A and S1 A ) sig - nificantly elevated integrin activity to the same extent as the loss of AMPK α in KO MEFs . Thus , both AMPK α isoforms suppress integrin activity . Consistently , loss of AMPK α in MEFs increased active β 1 - integrin levels as measured using the 9EG7 antibody recognizing the extended conformation of β 1 - integrin ( Fig . S1 B ; Byron et al . , 2009 ; Askari et al . , 2010 ) . AMPK α also suppressed integrin activity in human cells . Silencing AMPK α 1 alone with two independent siRNAs ( Fig . S1 C ) or both AMPK α 1 and AMPK α 2 isoforms ( termed siAMPK ; Fig . 1 B ) in human telomerase - immortalized fi - broblasts ( TIFs ) increased integrin activity compared with control - silenced TIFs . Moreover , treatment with the AMPK inhibitor dorsomorphin ( also known as Compound C ) pro - moted β 1 - integrin activity in TIFs ( Fig . 1 C ) . Importantly , AMPK silencing significantly increased the level of and the adhesion area occupied by active β 1 - integrin compared with control - silenced cells as measured by high - resolution total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy ( Figs . 1 D and S1 D ) . AMPK silencing was nearly as efficient in activating β 1 - integrins as exogenous stimulation with Mn 2 + ( Fig . S1 E ) . Collectively , AMPK inhibits β 1 - integrin activity in fibroblasts . AMPK depletion promotes fibrillar adhesion formation Given the striking effect of AMPK silencing on the distri - bution of active β 1 - integrin ( Fig . 1 D ) , we assessed in more detail the localization of active β 1 - integrin in cells plated on fibronectin - coated crossbow - shaped micropatterns , enabling normalization for cell shape ( Alanko et al . , 2015 ) . Represen - tative images of individual cells ( Fig . 2 A ) and mean intensity heat maps of multiple cells addressing overall protein distribu - tion ( Chen et al . , 2014b ) revealed more active β 1 - integrin after AMPK deletion in centrally located adhesions in MEFs ( Fig . 2 , A and B ) and in TIFs ( Fig . S2 A ) . In fibroblasts , integrins translocate centripetally from focal adhesions to mature , centrally located , elongated matrix contacts termed “fibrillar adhesions , ” which are enriched in ac - tive α 5 β 1 - integrin and tensin ( Pankov et al . , 2000 ; Zamir et al . , 2000 ) . To explore whether the ability of AMPK to suppress integrin activity is related to fibrillar adhesion formation , we assessed the distribution of the active ( ligand bound ) α 5 β 1 - integrin ( SNA KA51 antibody ; Clark et al . , 2005 ) and tensin1 in spreading TIFs ( because of antibody limitations , we were unable to study endogenous active mouse α 5 β 1 and tensin in MEFs ) using a high - resolution TIRF microscope . Active α 5 β 1 - integrin and tensin1 covered a larger cell area ( Fig . 2 , C and D ) , and active integrins showed a high degree of colocal - ization with tensin1 ( Fig . 2 , E and F ) in AMPK - silenced TIFs compared with controls . In contrast , the β 1 - integrin activator talin1 covered a smaller area in AMPK - silenced TIFs compared with control - silenced cells ( Fig . S2 B ) . Thus , loss of AMPK promotes β 1 - integrin activity in conjunction with an increased formation of fibrillar adhesions . Loss of AMPK enhances cell adhesion and fibrillogenesis Integrin activation and mature matrix adhesions are associ - ated with increased cell adhesion and spreading ( Geiger and Yamada , 2011 ; Theodosiou et al . , 2016 ) . Accordingly , cell spreading on fibronectin , mediated predominantly by α 5 β 1 - and α v - integrins , was markedly enhanced in AMPK KO MEFs compared with WT cells and in AMPK - silenced TIFs com - pared with control - silenced cells ( Figs . 3 A and S3 A ) . There was no significant difference in the adhesion of AMPK WT and KO MEFs on vitronectin , the ECM ligand for α v β 3 - and α v β 5 - integrins ( Fig . S3 B ) , suggesting that the loss of AMPK specifically affects the activity of β 1 - integrins ( in this case α 5 β 1 - integrin ) . Integrin activation and fibrillar adhesions are also essential in ECM remodeling and fibronectin fibrillogen - esis ( Zamir et al . , 2000 ; Gudzenko and Franz , 2015 ) . Congru - ently with increased fibrillar adhesions in AMPK KO MEFs , we observed significantly longer fibronectin fibers in AMPK KO MEFs supplemented with exogenous fibronectin compared with WT cells ( Fig . 3 B ) . Collectively , AMPK is a negative reg - ulator of essential integrin activity – dependent functions such as cell spreading and matrix remodeling . AmPK suppresses integrin activity through tensins • Georgiadou et al . 1109 Loss of AMPK enhances mechanotransduction and intracellular stiffness Fibronectin fibrillogenesis is directed by traction forces ( Lem - mon et al . , 2009 ) , and integrins represent the main mechano - transducers of the cell ( Schwarz and Gardel , 2012 ) . Therefore , we sought to explore whether AMPK regulates the mechani - cal stress exerted by MEFs on fibronectin - coated polyacryl - amide gels using traction force microscopy . Indeed , AMPK KO cells generated higher traction forces compared with WT cells ( Fig . 3 C ) , in accordance with a previous study showing that β 1 - integrin activation promotes the generation of cellular trac - tion forces ( Lin et al . , 2013 ) . The mechanical properties within the cell contribute to cell adhesion and traction stress generation , with β 1 - integrin being a major positive mediator of the intracellular mechan - ical state ( Baker et al . , 2009 ) . We thus decided to assess the intracellular mechanical parameters of AMPK WT and KO MEFs using confocal microscopy and the recently developed intracellular micromanipulation technique , which measures Figure 1 .

AmPK suppresses integrin activity through tensins • Georgiadou et al . 1111 the displacement of an internalized microsphere trapped in optical tweezers ( Fig . 3 D ; Guet et al . , 2014 ; Mandal et al . , 2016 ) . We noted significantly slower viscoelastic relaxation of microspheres in KO compared with WT MEFs ( Fig . 3 E ) , suggesting that the microsphere microenvironment is more re - sistant to mechanical deformation in the absence of AMPK . Accordingly , AMPK KO MEFs exhibited higher intracellular rigidity ( Fig . 3 F ) and a trend toward a more viscous environ - ment compared with WT cells when curves were fitted with the standard linear liquid ( SLL ) model ( see the Microrheol - ogy in micropatterned cells section of Materials and methods ; Fig . 3 G ) . However , cellular elasticity remained unaltered in the absence of AMPK ( Fig . 3 H ) . Tensin regulates integrin activity downstream of AMPK Given that AMPK loss promotes the formation of tensin - rich fibrillar adhesions , we assessed whether AMPK could regulate tensin expression . Of the four tensin family members ( ten - sins1 – 4 ) , tensin1 and tensin3 contain an integrin - binding ( the phosphotyrosine - binding [ PTB ] domain ) and an actin - binding site and localize to fibrillar adhesions ( Clark et al . , 2010 ) .

JCB • Volume 216 • NumBer 4 • 2017 1112 AmPK suppresses integrin activity through tensins • Georgiadou et al . 1113 AMPK KO MEFs , tensin3 protein levels were significantly in - creased compared with WT MEFs ( Fig . 4 , A and C ) , whereas the expression of other tensins ( tensins1 and 2 ) and of the known integrin activity regulators , talin , kindlin , ICAP1 , fila - min A , and SHA RPIN , remained unchanged ( Fig . 4 , A and C ) . In TIFs , the silencing of AMPK promoted tensin1 and tensin2 protein expression with no alterations in tensin3 , talin , kindlin , filamin A , or SHA RPIN expression levels ( Fig . 4 , B and C ) . In accordance with changes in protein expression , the mRNA levels of tensin3 in AMPK KO MEFs ( Fig . 4 D ) and tensin1 in siAMPK TIFs ( Fig . 4 E ) were significantly increased compared with the respective control cells . These data suggest that AMPK regulates the expression of fibrillar adhesion – associated tensins in an isoform - and cell type – dependent manner . Tensin1 binds the membrane - proximal talin - binding NPxY motif of β - integrin tails through its PTB domain ( Mc - Cleverty et al . , 2007 ) . Nevertheless , the ability of tensin to regu - late integrin inside - out activation has not been investigated thus far . To address whether tensins regulate integrin activity down - stream of AMPK , we silenced tensin1 ( siTensin1 ) or tensin3 ( siTensin3 ) in AMPK KO MEFs ( Fig . S4 A ) or AMPK - silenced TIFs ( Fig . S4 B ) , and we observed a significant reduction in integrin activity upon the silencing of either tensin isoform in both cell types . Combined silencing of tensin1 and tensin3 ( siTensins1 and 3 ) decreased integrin activity in AMPK KO MEFs even further than the depletion of the individual tensins ( Fig . S4 A ) , suggesting overlapping functions for tensin1 and tensin3 in the regulation of integrin activity . With this in mind , we decided to proceed with combined tensin1 and 3 silencing in the following experiments . Combined tensin silencing ( siTen - sin ) induced a significant reduction in integrin activity in both WT and KO MEFs and , importantly , abolished any difference in integrin activity levels between these cells ( Fig . 4 F ) . Re - introduction of human tensin1 ( GFP - TNS1 ) or human tensin3 ( GFP - TNS3 ) in tensin - silenced AMPK KO MEFs was able to rescue the decrease in integrin activity , and thus the observed effect of tensin siRNAs on integrin activity was not caused by off - target effects ( Fig . 4 G ) . Importantly , overexpression of ten - sin1 ( GFP - TNS1 ) and , more prominently , tensin3 ( GFP - TNS3 ) significantly increased integrin activity in TIFs ( Fig . 4 H ) and MEFs ( Fig . S4 C ) , whereas overexpression of the focal adhe - sion - specific tensin2 did not affect integrin activity in either TIFs or MEFs ( Figs . 4 H and S4 C ) . Collectively , these data demonstrate that tensin1 and tensin3 support β 1 - integrin activ - ity with possible overlapping and redundant roles . Direct binding of tensin1 to the β 1 - integrin tail has been demonstrated previously , and amino acids essential for this interaction have been identified ( McCleverty et al . , 2007 ) . In particular , alanine ( A ) substitution of proline P1624 in human tensin1 ( GFP - TNS1 P1624A ) disrupts the tensin1 – integrin inter - action and the centripetal movement of α 5 β 1 - integrin ( Rain - ero et al . , 2015 ) . To address whether tensin3 , the most potent tensin in supporting integrin activity , also regulates integrins through direct binding to the β 1 - integrin tail , we generated a point mutation in the PTB domain of tensin3 . Based on homol - ogy modeling using the established human tensin1 PTB do - main ( McCleverty et al . , 2007 ) , we identified histidine H1327 in the human tensin3 PTB domain as corresponding to P1624 in tensin1 ( Fig . 4 I ) . Based on these analyses , we generated a human tensin3 mutant ( GFP - TNS3 H1327A ) , which demonstrated clearly reduced binding to active β 1 - integrin when compared with tensin3 WT ( Fig . S4 D ) . To assess whether tensin - medi - ated integrin activation depends on an intact tensin – integrin association , we overexpressed the binding - defective variants GFP - TNS1 P1624A and GFP - TNS3 H1327A in TIFs silenced for endogenous tensins ( siTensin ) , which are known to form di - mers ( Lo et al . , 1994a ) . Although GFP - TNS1 and GFP - TNS3 significantly increased integrin activity in the absence of en - dogenous tensins , GFP - TNS1 P1624A was unable to increase integrin activity , and GFP - TNS3 H1327A had a very small effect compared with GFP ( Fig . 4 J ) . Collectively , the loss of AMPK promotes the transcriptional activation of the cytoskeletal pro - teins tensin1 and tensin3 , which bind to β 1 - integrin and sup - port receptor activation . Next , we investigated whether the ability of tensin to pro - mote integrin activity is independent of talin . To address this question , we overexpressed GFP - TNS3 in the absence of talin1 ( siTalin1 ) and observed that tensin3 could only modestly en - hance integrin activity ( Fig . 4 K ) . Based on these data , we hy - pothesize that integrin activity is triggered by talin1 in focal adhesions and subsequently maintained by tensins in fibrillar adhesions , where talin is mostly absent .

JCB • Volume 216 • NumBer 4 • 2017 1114 Tensin regulates cell spreading , mechanotransduction , and fibrillogenesis downstream of AMPK We further sought to explore whether tensin regulates the aforementioned integrin - dependent cellular functions down - stream of AMPK . Indeed , tensin1 and tensin3 silencing ( siTen - sin ) reduced the amount and the central distribution of active β 1 - integrin in AMPK KO MEFs plated on fibronectin - coated crossbow - shaped micropatterns ( Fig . 5 A ) . In addition , ten - sin silencing ( siTensin ) significantly reduced the spreading of AMPK KO MEFs plated on fibronectin ( Fig . 5 B ) . Finally , tensin silencing reduced both the mechanical stress exerted by AMPK KO MEFs and the remodeling of fibronectin fibers as compared with control - silenced cells ( Fig . 5 , C and D ) . To conclude , tensins act downstream of AMPK to regulate integrin activity and localization , cell spreading , mechanotransduction , and fibronectin fibrillogenesis . Discussion AMPK is a critical metabolic sensor in cells maintaining energy homeostasis . In recent years , an increasing number of studies demonstrate that AMPK regulates several other cellular func - tions , such as cell growth and transcription ( Mihaylova and Shaw , 2011 ) , cell polarity and cytoskeletal rearrangement ( Mir - ouse and Billaud , 2011 ) , and mitosis ( Banko et al . , 2011 ) . In this study , starting with unbiased screens ( Rantala et al . , 2011 ; Pellinen et al . , 2012 ) , we identified AMPK as an integrin ac - tivity inhibitor through its ability to negatively regulate the ex - pression of the integrin - binding proteins , tensins . Congruently , loss of AMPK promotes cell adhesion , mechanotransduction , and matrix assembly in fibroblasts ( Fig . 6 ) . Integrin activation by talins and kindlins has been studied extensively ; however , the role of other integrin - binding proteins in regulating integrin activity remains elusive . Our data demon - strate that the scaffold protein tensin , known to bind β - integrin at one of the talin - binding sites , supports β 1 - integrin activity . This is unprecedented , given that other integrin - binding pro - teins , like DOK - 1 , which has overlapping binding sites with talin , act as inhibitors of integrin activity ( Calderwood et al . , 2013 ) . A potential explanation for this finding is that tensins , similar to talin , are among the few proteins that couple integrins to actin ( Lo et al . , 1994b ; Horton et al . , 2016 ) , and thus the integrin – tensin complex could extend the list of molecules me - diating mechanosensitive coupling of active integrins to actin beyond the well - established integrin - talin - vinculin adhesions . Fibroblasts adhering to fibronectin generate different types of adhesions , such as nascent , focal , and fibrillar ad - hesions ( Geiger and Yamada , 2011 ) . The first newly formed nascent adhesions transform into focal adhesions and further into fibrillar adhesions under a maturation process that in - volves force ( Geiger and Yamada , 2011 ) . Talins and kindlins are generally absent from fibrillar adhesions , whereas we and others ( Clark et al . , 2005 ) have observed high levels of ac - tive β 1 - integrin localizing to these sites . It has been hypoth - esized earlier—but never shown—that tensin would replace talin in fibrillar adhesions to maintain integrins in an active state ( Pylayeva and Giancotti , 2007 ) . Interestingly , we find that tensins induce integrin activity only in conjunction with talin . This suggests that in cells , active integrins may transit from a talin - bound active state to a tensin - maintained active form localizing in fibrillar adhesions . Thus , in this study , we provide concrete evidence for the ability of tensin to support β 1 - integrin activity , in accordance with the hypothesis of a “talin – tensin switch . ” Previous work has demonstrated a critical role for tensins in integrin turnover specifically from fibrillar adhesions ( Rain - ero et al . , 2015 ) and has suggested that integrin and ECM uptake function to provide nutrients under starvation . It is likely that the level of active integrins in fibrillar adhesions is coupled to their endocytic uptake , but the details of this balance and its links to the metabolic state of the cell remain to be explored further . Integrin adhesion complexes link the ECM to the actin cytoskeleton and mediate force transmission and signaling ( Geiger et al . , 2001 ) , and thus integrin activity influences the mechanobiology of cells as well . Cell mechanics play a crucial role in cellular functions during development and disease . In this study , we correlate the loss of AMPK with a stiffening of the intracellular environment in agreement with previous work linking β 1 - integrin levels to the intracellular mechanical state ( Baker et al . , 2009 ) . Mechanotransduction from the plasma membrane to the cell interior could be mediated by the actin cytoskeleton ( Guet et al . , 2014 ; Mandal et al . , 2016 ) , which is strongly reorganized upon the loss of AMPK ( Fig . 1 D ) . An open question remains on how AMPK regulates ten - sin expression . AMPK is known to directly phosphorylate , and mostly negatively regulate , several transcription factors ( Mihaylova and Shaw , 2011 ) . Recently , it was suggested that AMPK can also regulate an array of miRNAs ( Liu et al . , 2013 ) . Thus , one possibility is that in the absence of AMPK , the tran - scription factor would translocate to the nucleus and promote tensin expression . Alternatively , an AMPK - regulated miRNA could inhibit tensin expression in cells . Initially , it might seem paradoxical that a lack of AMPK , a central metabolic regulator , could trigger energy - demanding functions such as matrix remodeling and mechanotransduction . However , the loss of AMPK promotes increased glycolysis ( Faubert et al . , 2013 ) to generate ATP and to fuel biosynthesis , and therefore AMPK - deficient fibroblasts are not under energy stress . Interestingly , quiescent fibroblasts , the primary cells that build and maintain the ECM in most soft connective tissues ( Humphrey et al . , 2014 ) , have increased glycolytic ( metabolic ) activity associated with enhanced ECM formation ( Lemons et al . , 2010 ; Suh et al . , 2012 ) . Fibrillar adhesions are critically important to the most relevant function of fibroblasts in vivo : ECM generation and remodeling . Excessive production of ECM proteins by fibro - blasts is linked to many severe human fibrotic conditions , such as chronic kidney disease ( Chen et al . , 2014a ) , cardiac hypertro - phy ( Pelouch et al . , 1993 ) , and liver fibrosis ( Lim et al . , 2012 ) . Recently , AMPK activation has been shown to ameliorate fibro - sis in several tissues , and AMPK activators have been suggested as potential therapeutics in the treatment of the aforementioned diseases ( Beauloye et al . , 2011 ; Satriano et al . , 2013 ) . Our data demonstrating that AMPK inhibition induces fibrillar adhe - sions , integrin activity , and the ability of fibroblasts to modify ECM composition via fibronectin fibrillogenesis provide im - portant mechanistic insight into the link between AMPK and fibrosis . Currently , the clinical relevance of tensins in fibrotic conditions linked to AMPK activity is not known , and this will be an interesting area of research in the future .

Model showing how AMPK loss promotes tensin - mediated integrin activity . In the absence of AMPK , the transcriptional constraints that limit ten - sin expression are removed . A corresponding increase in tensin expression leads to enhanced tensin binding to β 1 - integrin tails to support integrin activity after initial integrin activation by talin . This leads to enhanced fibrillar adhesion formation and integrin - dependent processes such as mechanotransduction and fibronectin remodeling . P , phosphorylated .

For func - tionalization , 0 . 2 mg / ml sulfo - SAN PAH ( 22589 ; Thermo Fisher Sci - entific ) and 2 mg / ml N - ( 3 - dimethylaminopropyl ) - N ′ - ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride ( EDC ; 03450 ; Sigma Aldrich ) in 50 mM Hepes were added on top of formed gels and incubated for 30 min at RT with gentle agitation . Gels were put into a UV chamber for 10 min without cover to activate the sulfo - SAN PAH and finally were washed three times with PBS before overnight coating with fibronectin at 4°C . Image acquisition and TFM analysis . Cells were plated onto TFM plates 24 h before the experiment . For imaging , we used an LSM780 laser - scanning confocal microscope and a 63× , 1 . 2 W C Apo - chromat objective ( ZEI SS ) . The cells were maintained in their culture medium during imaging and were imaged live at 37°C . A fluorescence image of the beads ( Excitation , 488 nm ; Detection , 500 – 550 nm ) and a phase - contrast image of the colonies were recorded for 7 – 10 colonies per sample . To ensure good - quality imaging of fluorescent beads , we performed Z stacks of 11 images with a separation of 1 µm and then manually chose the best focus . After the first round of images , cells were removed by the addition of an extraction buffer ( 20 mM NH 4 OH and 0 . 5 % Triton - X in PBS ) . At this point , reference images for each of the 7 – 10 locations , now without cells , were recorded in the exact same way as images acquired with the cells . To extract the bead displacement fields , we used a MAT LAB software package ( MathWorks ) provided by T . Betz ( University of Münster , Münster , Germany ) that uses a cor - relation algorithm described previously ( Betz et al . , 2011 ) . Traction forces were determined using the same MAT LAB software package after the Fourier transform traction force algorithm , as introduced by Butler et al . ( 2002 ) . Microrheology in micropatterned cells Active microrheology based on optical tweezers was performed in crossbow - shaped micropatterned cells ( Guet et al . , 2014 ; Mandal et al . , 2016 ) . In brief , 2 - µm - diameter fluorescent microspheres ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) were allowed to internalize in cells overnight . Cells were then detached and allowed to readhere for 2 h on 38 - µm - diam - eter crossbow - shaped micropatterns coated with 5 µg / ml fibronectin . The culture medium was supplemented with 20 mM Hepes before experimental manipulations on an A1R confocal microscope ( Nikon ) equipped with a 37°C incubator , a nanometric piezostage ( Mad City Labs ) , and a homemade single fixed optical trap ( 1 , 060 – 1 , 100 nm ; 2 - W maximal output power ; IPG Photonics ) . A bead was trapped by optical tweezers ( 1 - W laser output power , corresponding to 150 mW on the sample ) , and after a 0 . 5 - µm step displacement of the stage applied by the piezostage , the bead relaxation x b ( t ) toward the optical trap center was measured using single particle tracking . First , a model - indepen - dent phenomenological parameter , the rigidity index , was calculated as the normalized area under the relaxation curve ( Mandal et al . , 2016 ) . Second , the SLL model ( Bausch et al . , 1999 ; Chan et al . , 2015 ; Man - dal et al . , 2016 ) was used to fit the relaxation curves . The SLL model consists of a Kelvin – Voigt body ( a spring of spring constant μ and a dashpot of viscosity η in parallel ) and a dashpot in series . Quantitative real - time PCR Total cellular RNA was extracted using the NucleoSpin RNA kit ( MAC HER EY - NAG EL ) , and 1 µg of the extracted RNA was used as a template for cDNA synthesis by the high - capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit ( Applied Biosystems ) according to the manufacturer’s protocol . Expression levels of human and mouse Tensin1 and Tensin3 were determined by TaqMan quantitative real - time PCR using the RT - PCR HT7900 ( Applied Biosystems ) . The expression level of GAP DH was used as a reference ( endogenous control ) . TaqMan Universal Mas - ter Mix II included necessary components for quantitative RT - PCR reactions . The following primers from Sigma - Aldrich were used for human samples : human TNS1 ( forward , 5 ′ - CCA GAC ACC CAC CTG ACT TAG - 3 ′ , and reverse , 5 ′ - CAG CTC ATG GTT GGA TGGA - 3 ′ ; Uni - versal ProbeLibrary probe 82 ) , human TNS3 ( forward , 5 ′ - AGG CTG CCT GAC ACA GGA - 3 ′ , and reverse , 5 ′ - AGG GGC TGT TCA GCA GAG - 3 ′ ; Universal ProbeLibrary probe 57 ) , and human GAP DH ( for - ward , 5 ′ - GCT CTC TGC TCC TCC TGT TC - 3 ′ , and reverse , 5 ′ - ACG ACC AAA TCC GTT GAC TC - 3 ′ ; probe 60 ) . The following primers from Sigma - Aldrich were used for mouse samples : mouse Tns1 ( forward , 5 ′ - GAC AAG ATC GTG CCC ATTG - 3 ′ , and reverse , 5 ′ - CCA GAG AGT AGG CCA CTG AAG - 3 ′ ; Universal ProbeLibrary probe 82 ) and mouse Tns3 ( forward , 5 ′ - TCC GTT CAG TCC ACC TGAG - 3 ′ , and reverse , 5 ′ - ATC TCT GGG CAG CCT CGT - 3 ′ ; Universal ProbeLibrary probe 20 ) ; mouse Gapdh primers and probes were from Universal ProbeLibrary . Relative expression was calculated by the 2 ΔΔ CT method using the expression level of GAP DH as a reference for the quantification . Immunoprecipitation HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with expression constructs coding for pEGFP - C1 , GFP - TNS3 , and GFP - TNS3 with H1327A mu - tation . Cells were lysed ( 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 , 10 mM Pipes , pH 6 . 8 , 150 mM NaCl , 150 mM sucrose , 3 mM MgCl 2 , cOmplete , and phos - phatase inhibitors [ Mediq ; Roche ] ) , cleared by centrifugation , and incubated with antibody - coated protein G magnetic beads ( 1 µg of an - tibody per 10 µl of beads ; Dynabeads ; Thermo Fisher Scientific ) for 1 h at 4°C . Complexes bound to the beads were isolated using magnets , washed three times with ice - cold lysis buffer , and eluted in reducing sample buffer ( Jacquemet et al . , 2013 ) . Input and precipitate samples were analyzed by Western blotting . Homology modeling of TNS3 PTB domain The TNS3 - PTB domain ( 1309 – 1439 ) was modeled using a Swiss - Model server and the TNS1 - PTB domain ( 1606 – 1738 ; Protein Data AmPK suppresses integrin activity through tensins • Georgiadou et al . 1119 Bank ID : 1WVH ) as a template . Then , pairwise structure superimpo - sition of TNS3 - PTB and TNS1 - PTB was performed using Molecular Graphics Systems software ( 1 . 7 . 4 . 4 Edu ; PyMOL ) . Statistical analysis Statistical significance was determined using the unpaired two - tailed Student’s t test unless otherwise indicated . All experiments were re - peated at least three times unless otherwise indicated . Data distribution was assumed to be normal , but this was not formally tested . n numbers are indicated in the graphs as black dots or in the figure legends . A p - value of 0 . 05 was considered to be a borderline for statistical signif - icance . P - values are indicated in the figure legends . Tukey box plots show the 25th – 75th percentiles delineated by the upper and lower lim - its of the box , the median is shown by the horizontal line inside the box , whiskers extend to data points that are > 1 . 5× interquartile range away from first / third quartile , and outliers are represented by open circles .
