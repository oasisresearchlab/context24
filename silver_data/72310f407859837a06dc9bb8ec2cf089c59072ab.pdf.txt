Characterization of the Viscoelastic Properties of Ovarian Cancer Cells Membranes by Optical Tweezers and Quantitative Phase Imaging Thompson Lu and Bahman Anvari * Department of Bioengineering , University of California , Riverside , Riverside , CA , United States Ovarian cancer is the deadliest gynecological cancer in women . It is a highly metastatic disease with pelvis , regional lymph nodes , and peritoneal cavity as major sites for tumor deposits . Mechanical properties of ovarian cancer cells can play a major role in metastasis as the cells detach from the ovaries and undergo deformation during the metastatic process . Herein , we have characterized the viscoelastic properties of the plasma membrane of normal epithelial ( IOSE364 ) and cancerous ( SKOV3 ) ovarian cells by optical tweezers and quantitative phase imaging . Using optical tweezers , we obtained time - resolved force pro ﬁ les associated with membrane tethers pulled from the cells . We used quantitative phase imaging to measure the diameter of membrane tethers , and subsequently , estimated the membrane bending modulus and membrane tension in the tether . Our results indicate that the force ( 190 ± 76 pN ) ( mean ± standard deviation ) required to separate the membrane of SKOV3 cells from the cytoskeleton was signi ﬁ cantly lower ( p (cid:1) 0 . 0004 ) than the force ( 350 ± 81 pN ) for IOSE364 cells . The mean stiffness ( 2 . 8 ± 0 . 8 pN / μ m ) of membrane tethers pulled from SKOV3 cells was signi ﬁ cantly lower ( p (cid:1) 0 . 032 ) than the value for IOSE 364 cells ( 3 . 7 ± 0 . 8 pN / μ m ) . Mean value of the force relaxation characteristic time associated with diffusive ﬂ ow of lipids was also signi ﬁ cantly lower ( p (cid:1) 0 . 018 ) for SKOV3 membranes ( 12 . 9 ± 6 . 9 s ) as compared to the value for IOSE 364 membranes ( 20 . 4 ± 6 . 2 s ) . Similarly , the mean value of the membrane bending modulus for SKOV3 cells [ ( 0 . 51 ± 0 . 23 ) × 10 – 18 J ] was signi ﬁ cantly lower ( p (cid:1) 0 . 007 ) than the value for IOSE364 cells [ ( 1 . 29 ± 0 . 32 ) × 10 – 18 J ] . Overall , our results suggest that the membranes of SKOV3 cells are less resistant to mechanical deformation . Increased membrane susceptibility to mechanical deformation may be a facilitating factor in the metastatic behavior of cancerous ovarian cells . Characterization of membrane biomechanics may provide a useful diagnostic biomarker for assessment of the metastatic potential of ovarian cancer , and a target for development of therapeutics .

Only about 20 % of cases are diagnosed at stage I where the disease is con ﬁ ned to the ovaries . Once the disease spreads into the pelvis ( stage II ) , and metastasizes to other parts of the abdomen and / or regional lymph nodes ( stage III ) , the chance of patient survival diminishes to about 35 % [ 2 ] . Therefore , metastasis is a key determinant in survivability of patients with ovarian cancer . Passive dissemination and hematogenous metastasis are considered as the main mechanisms for ovarian cancer metastasis [ 3 ] . In passive dissemination , cancer cells detach from the ovaries , and are carried by peritoneal ﬂ uid and ascites , reaching the pelvis and peritoneal cavity [ 4 , 5 ] . In hematogenous metastasis , ovarian cancer cells at the primary site invade through the basal membrane of the blood or lymphatic vessels to intravasate into the circulation . Cancer cells then extravasate out of the circulation at the metastatic site [ 3 ] . Under either of the two mechanisms , the mechanical properties of the cell are the key determinants of its deformability during the detachment , intravasation , and extravasation processes that ultimately result in metastasis . Utilizing various techniques such as the optical stretcher , atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) , shear assays , and magnetic tweezers , the invasiveness of metastatic cancer cells has been demonstrated to correlate with their viscoelastic properties [ 6 – 11 ] . For example , using a shear assay technique , Hu et al . found that the stiffness of MCF - 10A normal breast cells was about 10 times higher than that the stiffness of the highly metastatic MDA - MB - 231 breast cancer cells , and attributed these differences to differences in the levels of actin expression and organization [ 11 ] . While the role of the cytoskeleton , and particularly actin , in relation to the mechanical characteristics of ovarian and other cancerous cells have been extensively studies [ 12 – 15 ] , changes in the mechanical properties of the membrane of ovarian cells as they transition from normal to becoming malignant has been less studied . In this study , we have utilized optical tweezers in combination with quantitative phase imaging ( QPI ) to characterize the mechanical properties of the membranes of cancerous and normal ovarian cells . Speci ﬁ cally , optical tweezers were used to obtain dynamic force pro ﬁ les associated with membrane tethers pulled from these cells . By ﬁ tting the relaxation phase of the force pro ﬁ les with biphasic exponential functions , the viscoelastic properties of the cell membrane could be quanti ﬁ ed . We used QPI to estimate the diameter of the membrane tethers pulled from these cells , and subsequently used this information to quantify the bending modulus and membrane tension associated with these tethers . We found that there were statistically signi ﬁ cant differences in some of the viscoelastic properties of the membranes of ovarian cancerous cells as compared to those for normal ovarian cells . Our ﬁ ndings suggest that membrane biomechanics may provide a useful diagnostic biomarker for assessment of the metastatic potential of ovarian cancer , and a target for development of therapeutics . MATERIALS AND METHODS Optical Tweezers and Quantitative Phase Imaging Setup The instrumentation platform combining optical tweezers and QPI is reported in our previous publication [ 16 ] , and shown in Figure 1 . An optical trap was formed using a 1 , 064 nm Nd : YVO 4 ( Coherent , Prisma - 1064 - 8 - V ) . The laser beam was expanded and collimated before entering an inverted microscope ( Nikon , Ti - Eclipse ) to ﬁ ll the back aperture of a 1 . 3 NA × 100 oil immersion objective ( MO ) ( Nikon , 100x Plan Fluor ) lens . A dichroic mirror ( DM ) ( Chroma , Z900DCSP ) was used to re ﬂ ect the laser light into the MO , which focused the light to form an optical trap . Fluorescent 4 . 2 µm diameter sulfate - modi ﬁ ed polystyrene beads ( Thermo ﬁ sher , F8858 ) were trapped , and used as handles to extract tethers from the cells , and as probes for measuring the resulting force pro ﬁ les . The beads have an excitation spectrum between 480 and 590 nm . Excitation light from a mercury lamp ( ML ) ( Nikon Intenslight , C - HGFI ) passed through a ﬁ lter cube ( FC ) ( Nikon , TRITC TE 2000 ) that transmitted the light in the range of 525 – 560 nm to illuminate the trapped bead and passed emitted ﬂ uorescent light from the bead in the range of 570 – 620 nm . Fluorescence emission from the bead was passed through the DM and a mirror on a directional turret that directed the bead ﬂ uorescence to a quadrant photodetector ( QPD ) ( First Sensor , QP1 - 6 - T05 - SD2 ) . The emitted light was focused by a lens ( L ) ( f (cid:1) 25 mm ) and ﬁ ltered by a bandpass ﬁ lter ( BP ) ( Chroma , 605 ± 25 nm ) before reaching the QPD . We used ﬂ uorescent beads to overcome an artifact in the force measurements due to the presence of the cell when it is in close proximity to the bead ( < 0 . 5 µm apart from each other ) . Speci ﬁ cally , shadow of the cell projected onto the photodetector induces an artifact in the force measurement that can be as high as 75 pN [ 17 ] . When using ﬂ uorescent beads , the optical signal for force measurement is only transmitted by the bead and does not include a contribution form the cell . Hence , we used the ﬂ uorescence image projected onto the QPD as the signal to quantify the bead displacement from the trapping center during tether pulling experiments . To calibrate the output voltage of the QPD for force measurements , a drag force with known value based on Stokes ’ Law , was applied to the trapped bead while recording the resulting differential signal ( sum - and - difference output voltage in mV ) from the QPD . The drag force was generated by driving a piezoelectric translation - stage ( Physik Instrumente , Model P - 527 . C3 , Waldbronn , Germany ) at known velocities . The resolution of the piezoelectric stage was 10 nm in x and y directions , and 2 nm in z directions ( laser beam propagation direction ) . There was a linear relationship between the applied drag force and the QPD differential output voltage ( Supplementary Figure S1 ) . The relationship between the bead displacement and QPD signal was determined by moving a bead immobilized on a poly - D - lysine coated coverslip at known displacements with the piezoelectric translation - stage while recording the QPD differential voltage signal . There was a linear relationship Frontiers in Physics | www . frontiersin . org November 2020 | Volume 8 | Article 582956 2 Lu and Anvari Viscoelasticity of Ovarian Cells Membranes between bead QPD output signal and the bead displacement ( Supplementary Figure S2 ) . The differential output voltage from the QPD ampli ﬁ er was digitized using an analog - to - digital converter ( BNC2110 , National Instruments , Austin , TX ) and subsequently , recorded by LabVIEW software ( LabVIEW 7 , National Instruments , Austin , TX ) . Data collection frequency was 2 , 500 Hz . In our tether pulling experiments , approximately 400 mW of laser was delivered to the sample plane . As determined by the product of the slopes of the two calibration curves ( Supplementary Figures S1 , S2 ) , this power corresponds to trap stiffness of 227 pN / μ m . For QPI , samples were illuminated from a 100 W halogen lamp source through a condenser annulus and a condenser lens . We used the same 100 × oil immersion objective for both optical trapping and QPI . Un - scattered light through the sample formed an image of the condenser annulus at the focal plane of lens L1 ( f (cid:1) 500 mm ) , on a re ﬂ ective spatial light modulator ( SLM ) ( Hamamatsu LCOS - SLM X - 10468 ) . The SLM was used to introduce four phase shifts in π / 2 increments to the un - scattered light . The same directional mirror used to direct ﬂ uorescence emission from the bead to the QPD was used to send light to the SLM system . The image of the un - scattered light interfering with the scattered light through the sample was focused onto an electron - multiplying charge - coupled device ( EM - CCD ) ( C9100 - 13 , Hamamatsu ) by a lens L2 ( f (cid:1) 500 mm ) . An IR ﬁ lter ( F ) was placed in front of the EM - CCD to ﬁ lter the extraneous 1 , 064 nm light from the optical trap . To accommodate full re - arrangement of the nematic liquid crystals in the SLM , ﬁ eld delays of 83 ms ( SLM response time for π / 2 modulation ) were used between the phase modulations . We acquired 12 phase shifted images every second to yield quantitative phase resolved images at 3 frames per second . Using the four different intensity images , I 0 , I π , I π 2 , I 3 π 2 , corresponding to different phase modulations introduced by the SLM , the phase difference ( Δ φ ) between the un - scattered and scattered light was determined as : Δ φ (cid:1) tan − 1 (cid:1) I 0 − I π I π 2 − I 3 π 2 (cid:3) ( 1 ) We obtained phase maps as : φ (cid:1) tan − 1 (cid:1) β sin Δ φ 1 + β cos Δ φ (cid:3) ( 2 ) where β is the ratio of the amplitude of the scattered to un - scattered light [ 16 , 18 ] . The QPI system was calibrated using 400 and 630 nm polystyrene beads , with index of refraction n polystyrene (cid:1) 1 . 59 in air , seeded on glass bottom dishes [ 16 ] . The EM - CCD was calibrated with a 10 µm spacing ruler , and the pixel size was determined as 150 nm / pixel . The spatial noise of the QPI system was determined by measuring the standard deviation of phase from background of the sample plane , and estimated as ∼ 0 . 02 rad . We estimated the tether diameter ( d tether ) at the end of force relaxation as [ 16 ] : d tether (cid:1) λφ 2 π ( n cell − n media ) ( 3 ) where λ is the center excitation wavelength of the lamp ( 595 nm ) , φ is the phase averaged along the length of the tether , n cell is the refractive index of the cell membrane , and n media is the refractive index of the cell media ( ∼ 1 . 337 ) [ 16 ] . Since the refractive index for ovarian cell membranes are unknown , we used 1 . 361 , which is the average value in the reported range of 1 . 354 – 1 . 368 for mammalian cell membranes [ 19 ] . For the measurements of d tether by the QPI system , we pulled 4 tethers from 4 IOSE346 cells , and 4 tethers from SKOV3 cells ( i . e . , one tether per cell ) . Cell Culture We used SKOV3 and IOSE364 as the respective cancerous and normal epithelial ovarian cell lines . The SKOV3 ( ATCC ) cell line was grown in T - 25 tissue culture ﬂ asks containing Rosewell Park Memorial Institute ( RPMI 1640 ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) and 1 % antibiotic - antimycotic . The IOSE364 FIGURE 1 | Schematic of the instrumentation platform consisting of optical tweezers and quantitative phase imaging system .

Frontiers in Physics | www . frontiersin . org November 2020 | Volume 8 | Article 582956 3 Lu and Anvari Viscoelasticity of Ovarian Cells Membranes ( Canadian Ovarian Tissue Bank ) cell line was grown in T - 25 culture ﬂ asks with 50 / 50 by volume mixture of MCDB105 and 199 media containing 10 % FBS and 1 % gentamycin . Both cell lines were incubated in an air jacked incubator at 37 ° C with 5 % CO 2 . At 80 – 90 % con ﬂ uency , the cells were passaged onto poly - D - lysine coated glass bottom dishes ( MatTek P35GC - 1 . 0 - 14C ) . Experiments were performed on cells passaged onto the glass bottom dishes after 24 h incubation . Prior to placing the cells into the setup , they were washed with isotonic phosphate buffer saline ( PBS ) and the medium was replaced with their respective cell media ( RPMI for SKOV3 , MCDB105 / 199 for IOSE364 ) without FBS , and containing the ﬂ uorescent sulfate - modi ﬁ ed polystyrene beads . Tether Extraction Protocol Adherent , non - round cells with a long axis diameter of ∼ 20 µm were selected for tether pulling to ensure that healthy cells were being investigated . An optically trapped bead was brought to a cell of interest using the piezo - translation stage . Cell - bead attachment was determined by a displacement of the bead from the center of the optical tweezers , as indicated by the change in voltage from the output of the QPD . After about 30 s of bead - cell attachment , the cell was displaced away from the bead at velocity 1 μ m / s for 20 µm . Pulling was stopped at that time , allowing for force relaxation to equilibrium . Time - resolved force pro ﬁ les were recorded throughout the tether formation and relaxation processes . For analysis of the force pro ﬁ les , we pulled 8 tethers from 8 different IOSE364 cells , and 15 tethers from 15 different SKOV3 cells ( i . e . , one tether per cell ) . Data Analysis Force relaxation pro ﬁ les were ﬁ tted with biphasic exponential function : F ( t ) (cid:1) F eq + Ae − ( t τ short ) + Be − ( t τ long ) ( 4 ) where F eq is the tether force at the end of relaxation , and τ short and τ long are two characteristic times associated with the tether force relaxation dynamics . The shorter characteristic time ( τ short ) represents the Marangoni convective ﬂ ow of lipids from a region of low membrane tension to region of high membrane tension [ 20 , 21 ] . The longer characteristic time ( τ long ) is attributed to the diffusive ﬂ ow of the lipids [ 22 , 23 ] . The biphasic function is consistent with the solution to a second order generalized Kelvin model of force relaxation [ 24 ] , and has been used in ﬁ tting the relaxation pro ﬁ les [ 22 , 23 ] . We estimated F eq by averaging the force during the last 10 s of the force relaxation pro ﬁ le . Using F eq , we estimated the tether stiffness ( k tether ) as : k tether (cid:1) F eq ( L + dL ) (cid:1) F eq L ′ ( 5 ) where L ′ is the length of the tether at the end of elongation ( ∼ 20 µm ) and dL is the increase in the tether length during relaxation ( estimated to be 0 . 197 ± 0 . 07 µm for IOSE364 and 0 . 215 ± 0 . 1 µm for SKOV3 ) . Results for various physical properties are reported in box - and - whisker plots . The bottom line of the box represents the 25th quartile , and the top line represents the 75th quartile of the data . Median values of each quantity are indicated by the horizontal lines within each box . Mean values are indicated by the square in the center of the box and whisker plot . The whiskers show the range of measured values . We used two - tailed Student ’ s t - test with unequal variance in our statistical analysis of the various parameters . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION A video of a tether pulling process from an SKOV3 cells is provided in Supplementary Video S1 . Illustrative force pro ﬁ les associated with tethers pulled from IOSE346 and SKOV3 cells , and the corresponding biphasic exponential ﬁ ts to force relaxations are presented in Figure 2 . Both normal and cancerous ovarian cells exhibit similar pro ﬁ les . These pro ﬁ les are also consistent with those associated with tethers pulled from other cell types , including guinea pig outer hair cells ( OHCs ) [ 25 ] , human embryonic kidney ( HEK ) cells [ 22 ] , and mouse microglial cells [ 26 ] . Prior to the start of pulling , the force is negative due to cell pushing the bead in the opposite direction to that of the stage movement . Once pulling starts , the force steeply increases until reaching a maximum value ( F max ) , followed by a sudden reduction from F max , consistent with other studies [ 22 , 27 – 29 ] . Subsequently , the force is increased as the tether is elongated . When pulling stops , force relaxation to equilibrium takes place . Our pulling velocity of 1 μ m / s is at the lower end of what is reported as the intermediate velocity range ( 1 – 100 μ m / s ) , or the permeation regime [ 30 ] . Velocities lower than the permeation regime ( e . g . , 0 . 01 μ m / s ) are associated with the spontaneous dissociation velocity of membrane - cytoskeleton binders . At such ultra - low pulling velocities , the cell membrane composed of lipids and integral proteins behave as an ultra - viscous sheet . At ultra - high velocities above the permeation regime ( > 100 µm ) , the binders are indicated to be torn out [ 30 ] . The mean ± standard deviation ( SD ) values of F max for tethers pulled from IOSE364 and SKOV3 were 350 ± 81 pN and 190 ± 76 pN , respectively ( Figure 3A ) . Value of F max is associated with the enregetic processes to bend the cell membrane , surmount the membrane - cytoskeleton adhesion ( W 0 ) , and overcome the viscous resistance as the pulling process begins . The statistically sign ﬁ cant ( p (cid:1) 0 . 0004 ) reduction in the mean value of F max for SKOV3 cells suggests that the net sum of these energetics is lowered for SKOV3 cells . Following results and discussion provide further insight into these energetics . As the tether is elongated in the permeation regime , the cell body membrane lipids are drawn into the tether as they ﬂ ow around transmembrane proteins and / or slip against the underlying cytoskeleton . This viscous drag of the lipids gives rise to increased membrane tension in the tether . At the end of tether elongation ( i . e . , at the onset of force relaxation ) , the membrane tension in the tether ( σ tether ) is higher than the tension in the membrane of the cell body , a state that drives the lipid transport of the lipids until force relaxation is completed Frontiers in Physics | www . frontiersin . org November 2020 | Volume 8 | Article 582956 4 Lu and Anvari Viscoelasticity of Ovarian Cells Membranes and equilibrium reached . At equilibrium , the net ﬂ ow of the lipids is zero , and σ tether is balanced against the lateral ( in - plane ) tension in the cell membrane ( σ cell ) , and the tension resulting from W 0 [ 30 , 31 ] : σ tether (cid:1) σ cell + W 0 . ( 6 ) The mean ± standard deviation values of F eq for IOSE364 and SKOV3 cells were 74 . 8 ± 17 . 0 and 57 . 5 ± 16 . 3 pN , respectively ( Figure 3B ) , and signi ﬁ cantly different from each other ( p (cid:1) 0 . 034 ) . As discussed below , the lower mean value of F eq for SKOV3 is related to σ tether and the membrane bending modulus ( κ ) . The mean value of k tether for SKOV3 cells ( 2 . 8 ± 0 . 8 pN / μ m ) was sign ﬁ cantly lower ( p (cid:1) 0 . 032 ) than the mean value for IOSE364 cells ( 3 . 7 ± 0 . 8 pN / μ m ) ( Figure 3C ) , suggesting that the membrane of SKOV3 was less resistant to elongation . Statistically , the mean value of τ short for IOSE364 ( 1 . 9 ± 1 . 2 s ) and SKOV3 cells ( 1 . 6 ± 1 . 1 s ) were not signi ﬁ cantly different from each other ( Figure 4A ) . These values are on the same order as those for tethers pulled at 1 μ m / s from HEK cells ( ∼ 1 . 2 s ) [ 22 ] , OHCs ( ∼ 3 . 7 s ) [ 24 ] , regardless of manipulating the respective membrane composition of these cells by external agents ( cholesterol and chlorpromazine ) , as well as cytoskeletal - lacking synthetic liposomes ( ∼ 2 – 4 s ) [ 23 ] . These results suggest that the short characteristic time for the convective ﬂ ow of the lipids from the cell body ( region of low membrane tension ) toward the tether ( region of high membrane tension ) , due to the Marangoni effect , has slight dependency on the cell type , membrane composition , and presence of cytoskeleton . The mean value of τ long for SKOV3 cells ( 12 . 9 ± 6 . 9 s ) , however , was signi ﬁ cantly shorter ( p (cid:1) 0 . 018 ) than the value for IOSE364 cells ( 20 . 4 ± 6 . 2 s ) . This reduction in τ long for SKOV3 cells is indicative of reduced barriers to the diffusive ﬂ ow of lipids FIGURE 2 | Illustrative force pro ﬁ les associated with tethers pulled from ( A ) IOSE364 , and ( B ) SKOV3 cells .

Frontiers in Physics | www . frontiersin . org November 2020 | Volume 8 | Article 582956 5 Lu and Anvari Viscoelasticity of Ovarian Cells Membranes from the cell body into the tether , suggesting that the architecture of SKOV3 membrane may be altered in ways that reduce the viscous resistance of cytoskeletal - bound membrane proteins and other membrane structures to lipids ﬂ ow [ 32 ] . Bright ﬁ eld and the corresponding tether images of tethers from IOSE364 and SKOV3 cells obtained by QPI are shown in Figure 5 . While tethers under bright ﬁ eld typically were not visible , QPI provided a capability to visualize the tethers against the surrounding background . Interestingly , QPI revealed tether - like structures protruding from the SKOV3 cell at improved contrast . These protrusions are attributed to ﬁ lamentous actin ( F - actin ) polymerization [ 33 – 36 ] , and suggestive of the migratory structure and potential capability of these cells to breach basement membranes , and invade tissues and vasculature [ 37 ] . Formation of these protrusion is consistent with our ﬁ nding of reduced membrane stiffness ( Figure 3C ) for SKOV3 , allowing the membrane to more readily extend in response to the forces exerted by F - actin during polymerization [ 38 – 40 ] . The mean value of d tether for SKOV3 cells ( 110 ± 45 nm ) was signi ﬁ cantly smaller ( p (cid:1) 0 . 010 ) than that for IOSE364 cells ( 217 ± 33 nm ) ( Figure 6A ) . Using the estimated measurements of d tether , we subsequently estimated κ , a property that allows the membrane bilayer to resist a change in its curvature , and σ tether as follows . Assuming that the tether is cylindrically - shaped with length L ′ , the free energy of the tether ( E tether ) can be written as [ 41 ] : E tether (cid:1) π d tether L ′ σ tether + 2 πκ L ′ d tether − F eq L ′ ( 7 ) To minimize E tether , the membrane tension acts to reduce the diameter of the tether while the bending modulus opposes it . The balance between these two opposing energies determines d tether and F eq at equilibrium , which can be determined by : z E tether z d tether (cid:1) 0 ( 8a ) and z E tether z L ′ (cid:1) 0 . ( 8b ) Equations 7 and 8 together yield : d tether (cid:1) 2 (cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4) κ 2 σ tether (cid:5) , ( 9 ) and F eq (cid:1) 2 π (cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4) 2 σ tether κ (cid:6) . ( 10 ) From Eqs 9 and 10 , we obtain κ (cid:1) F eq d tether 4 π , ( 11 ) and : σ tether (cid:1) F eq 2 π d tether . ( 12 ) To estimate the SD associated with κ and σ tether , we used the error propagation method [ 42 ] : α J (cid:1) J (cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4) ⎛⎜⎝ F eq α F eq ⎞⎟⎠ 2 + ⎛⎜⎜⎝ d tether α d tether ⎞⎟⎟⎠ 2 (cid:13)(cid:14) ( 13 ) where α J is the estimated SD associated with the mean value of the quantity of interest ( κ , and σ tether ) , J is the calculated average value of quantity of interest ( κ , and σ tether ) , F eq is the average value of F eq , α F eq is the SD associated with F eq , d tether is the average value of d tether , and α d tether is the SD associated with d tether . Using Eq . 11 , and the mean ± SD values of F eq ( Figure 3A ) and d tether ( Figure 6A ) , the estimated values of κ for IOSE364 ( 1 . 29 ± 0 . 32 ) × 10 – 18 J ( ∼ 313 k B T ) and SKOV3 ( 0 . 51 ± 0 . 23 ) × 10 – 18 J FIGURE 4 | Box - and - whisker plots for ( A ) short ( τ short ) , and ( B ) long ( τ long ) characteristic times associated with tethers pulled from IOSE364 and SKOV3 cells . Number of tethers were 8 for IOSE364 , and 15 for SKOV cells . Single asterisk * indicates a statistically signi ﬁ cant different at p (cid:1) 0 . 018 . Frontiers in Physics | www . frontiersin . org November 2020 | Volume 8 | Article 582956 6 Lu and Anvari Viscoelasticity of Ovarian Cells Membranes ( ∼ 124 k B T ) cells ( where k B is the Boltzmann constant ( ∼ 1 . 38 × 10 – 23 J / K ) , and T (cid:1) 298 K ) were signi ﬁ cantly different from each other ( p (cid:1) 0 . 007 ) ( Figure 6B ) . These values are comparable to the values for microglial cells ( ∼ 211 k B T ) and macrophages ( ∼ 189 k B T ) [ 26 ] , but higher than those for astrocytes ( ∼ 63 k B T ) , glioblastoma GBM95 cells ( ∼ 68 k B T ) [ 26 ] and ﬁ broblasts ( ∼ 73 k B T ) [ 28 ] . The nearly 60 % reduction in the value of κ for SKOV3 cells is suggestive of the reduced resistance of the membrane of these cells to curvature changes as compared to IOSE364 cells . Using Eq . 12 , the estimated σ tether ∼ ( 95 . 0 ± 37 . 3 ) × 10 – 18 J / μ m 2 for SKOV3 cells was signi ﬁ cantly higher ( p (cid:1) 0 . 006 ) than σ tether ∼ ( 54 . 8 ± 13 . 7 ) × 10 – 18 J / μ m 2 for IOSE364 cells ( Figure 6C ) . Changes in membrane tension are thought to be a regulator of cell motility in coordination with the dynamics of cytoskeletal actin [ 43 ] . In view of this notion , the increase in σ tether for SKOV3 cells is suggestive of changes in the potential motility of these cells as compared to IOSE364 cells . Our estimated values of σ tether are comparable to those for microglial cells ( 56 × 10 − 18 J / μ m 2 ) , astrocytes ( 50 × 10 − 18 J / μ m 2 ) , and glioblastoma GBM95 cells ( 51 × 10 − 18 J / μ m 2 ) , but higher than the values for neuronal cell bodies ( 16 × 10 – 18 J / μ m 2 ) and neurites ( 15 × 10 − 18 J / μ m 2 ) [ 26 ] . Results of tether pulling experiments from mouse ﬁ broblast and human melanoma blebbing cells that lack cytoskeletal support indicate that the value of σ cell is in the range of 1 – 3 × 10 − 18 J / μ m 2 [ 44 , 45 ] . Similarly , our previous results based on tethers pulled from HEK cells with disrupted membrane - cytoskeleton attachments indicate σ cell ∼ 5 × 10 – 18 J / μ m 2 [ 22 ] . Based on the results reported in these studies , there appears to be little variation in the value of σ cell among different cell types . Furthermore , since σ cell < σ tether , the major determinant of membrane tension in the tether is W 0 ( Eq . 6 ) [ 31 , 44 ] . Since σ tether for SKOV3 cells was higher than the corresponding value for IOSE364 cells ( Figure 6C ) , it would appear that W 0 for SKOV3 cells would be concomitantly higher ( Eq . 6 ) . However , the reduction in the mean value of F max for SKOV3 cells ( Figure 3A ) suggests that both the lowered κ ( Figure 6B ) and viscous resistance of the membrane , characterized by τ long ( Figure 4B ) , dominate the energetics associated with detachment of the membrane from the cytoskeleton as compared to W 0 . Given that the value of F eq for SKOV3 cells was signi ﬁ cantly lower for SKOV3 cells ( Figure 3B ) , we attribute the basis for it to the signi ﬁ cantly lower value of κ for these cells ( Figure 6B ) as being the dominant mechanical property as compared to σ tether ( Eq . 10 ) , which was estimated to be higher for SKOV3 cells ( Figure 6C ) . In this study , we have characterized the viscoelastic properties of the membranes of normal and cancerous human ovarian cells using an instrumentation platform that combines optical tweezers and QPI . A key advantage of this platform is that it enables quanti ﬁ cation of membrane bending modulus and tension , two important mechanical parameters that require the measurements of tether force and diameter . Although tether force has been extensively measured by several investigators for different cells [ 38 , 46 – 51 ] , a challenge in the ﬁ eld has been the measurements of the tether diameter . Previously , a method using scanning electron microscopy has been reported [ 28 ] . However , FIGURE 5 | Representative images of IOSE364 and SKOV3 cells obtained by ( A , C ) bright ﬁ eld microscopy , and ( B , D ) QPI . Arrows point to tethers , which are not visible under bright ﬁ eld , but become resolvable by QPI . Membrane protrusions from SKOV3 cells can also be visualized at improved contrast by QPI . Frontiers in Physics | www . frontiersin . org November 2020 | Volume 8 | Article 582956 7 Lu and Anvari Viscoelasticity of Ovarian Cells Membranes this method requires ﬁ xing the cells after pulling tethers from them , and using geometrical approximations to estimate the tether diameter . QPI allows provides an optical measurement of the tether radius without ﬁ xing the cells , simultaneously with measurements of the tether force by optical tweezers . We have previously veri ﬁ ed the accuracy of QPI - based measurements ( 172 ± 16 nm ) against AFM - based measurements ( 179 ± 15 nm ) of a pattern of depths , etched within a microchip [ 16 ] . Our combined optical tweezers and QPI platform provides a capability for mechanical characterization of various cell types under different conditions and stimuli . Important ﬁ ndings of this study are that as compared to the membranes of IOSE364 cells , the membranes of SKOV3 cells have signi ﬁ cantly lower F max for detachment from cytoskeleton ( Figure 3A ) , tether stiffness ( Figure 3C ) , membrane bending modulus ( Figure 6B ) , and characteristic time for lipid ﬂ ow ( Figure 4B ) , the latter indicative of reduced membrane viscosity . These ﬁ ndings collectively suggest that the membranes of cancerous SKOV3 ovarian cells are less resistant to mechanical forces and deformation . Increased membrane susceptibility to mechanical deformation may be a facilitating factor in the metastatic behavior of cancerous ovarian cells . Consistent with our ﬁ ndings , AFM - based studies indicate that the value of Young ’ s modulus for IOSE cells is higher than the corresponding values for different ovarian cancer cell lines [ 52 ] . Swaminathan et al . [ 9 ] have found that ovarian cancer cell types with highest migratory and invasiveness have lower stiffness values . In particular , these investigators reported that the stiffness of SKOV3 cells , which were shown to have a high relative invasiveness , was nearly threefold lower than that of IGROV cells that had a low relative invasiveness . Ketene et al . have reported that the stiffness and viscosity of mouse ovarian surface epithelial ( MOSE ) cells progressively decrease as the cells transition from benign to early - and late - stage malignancy stages , and attributed these biomechanical alterations to organizational changes to cytoskeletal actin [ 53 ] . Based on our ﬁ ndings , we propose that in addition to changes in actin organization ( e . g . , F - actin polymerization ) , the mechanical properties of the membrane itself can also play a role in the progression of ovarian cancer malignancy . As such , the membrane biomechanical properties cells could potentially provide diagnostic value and serve as a biomarker to assay the metastatic potential of ovarian cancer cells . The reduced κ for SKOV3 cells ( Figure 6B ) suggests that the membrane composition and / or architecture are altered in these cells . Cholesterol and lipids including phosphosphingolipids ( sphingomyelin ) form membrane lipid rafts ( caveolae ) that in ﬂ uence the membrane bending rigidity [ 54 ] . Therefore , it is plausible that the lower value of κ for SKOV3 cells may be due to the altered amount of cholesterol and / or compositional / structural changes to the lipid rafts . Lokar et al . [ 55 ] have reported that cholesterol depletion in the membrane of urothelial cancer cells resulted in dispersion of cholesterol - sphingomyelin nanodomains , and an increase in the diameter of nanotubes ( tether - like structures ) interconnecting the cells . As such , our ﬁ nding that tethers pulled from SKOV3 cells had a signi ﬁ cantly smaller ( p (cid:1) 0 . 010 ) d tether ( Figure 6A ) , and subsequently , lower κ ( Eq . 11 ; Figure 6B ) ( p (cid:1) 0 . 007 ) is suggestive of increased membrane cholesterol content and / or compositional changes to the rafts and their landscape within the membrane bilayer . Further evidence toward the role of phosphosphingolipids in modulating the biomechanical properties of ovarian cancer cells comes from a study that involved treatment of the cells with speci ﬁ c components of phosphosphingolipids ( sphingosine , ceramide , or sphoingosine - 1 - phosphate ) [ 56 ] . While treatment with ceramide or sphingosine - 1 - phosphate reduced the average elastic modulus of transitional and aggressive MOSE cells , sphingosine ( the backbone component of phosphosphingolipids ) treatment increased the average elastic modulus in the aggressive cells . In view of these ﬁ ndings , a reduction in membrane bending modulus and stiffness of SKOV3 cells may be attributable to increased content of ceramide or sphingosine - 1 - phosphate as metabolites of phosphosphingolipids within the membrane , or alternatively to decreased content of phosphosphingolipids or its sphingosine backbone , which in turn , would suggest a reduction in the size of the raft domains . Smaller rafts may reduce the physical barriers FIGURE6 | Box - and - whiskerplotsfor ( A ) tetherdiameter , andmeanvaluesof ( B ) membranebendingmodulus ( κ ) , and ( C ) tethermembranetension ( σ tether ) .

Frontiers in Physics | www . frontiersin . org November 2020 | Volume 8 | Article 582956 8 Lu and Anvari Viscoelasticity of Ovarian Cells Membranes for the ﬂ ow of the non - raft lipid components of the membrane ; hence , resulting in lower diffusion time as we have observed ( Figure 4B ) . In view of our ﬁ ndings with respect to alterations in some of the mechanical properties of SKOV3 cells , it is possible that the membrane biomechanics of ovarian cancer cells may serve as a potentially useful biomarker for diagnostic assessment and a potential target by therapeutic agents for controlling metastasis . CONCLUSION Utilizing an instrumentation platform that combines optical tweezers with QPI , we have characterized the viscoelastic properties of the membranes of normal ( IOSE364 ) and cancerous ( SKOV3 ) ovarian cells . Using dynamic force pro ﬁ les associated with tethers pulled from these cells in conjunction with QPI - based estimates of tether diameters and quantitative analyses , we ﬁ nd that the membranes of SKOV3 cells require a statistically signi ﬁ cant lower force to become separated from the cytoskeleton , and have statistically signi ﬁ cant lower stiffness , bending modulus , and characteristic time associated with lipid ﬂ ow . Our biomechanical characterization approach and results may pave the way for future directions and studies aimed at using the membrane biomechanics as a possible diagnostics biomarker for assessment of the metastatic potential of ovarian cancer , and a target for development of therapeutics .
