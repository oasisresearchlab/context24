ARTICLE Familial deletion within NLGN4 associated with autism and Tourette syndrome Amy Lawson - Yuen 1 , Juan - Sebastian Saldivar 2 , Steve Sommer 2 and Jonathan Picker * , 1 1 Department of Genetics , Children’s Hospital Boston , Boston , MA , USA ; 2 Department of Molecular Genetics , Clinical Molecular Diagnostic Laboratory , City of Hope , Duarte , CA , USA Neuroligin 4 ( NLGN4 ) is a member of a cell adhesion protein family that appears to play a role in the maturation and function of neuronal synapses . Mutations in the X - linked NLGN4 gene are a potential cause of autistic spectrum disorders , and mutations have been reported in several patients with autism , Asperger syndrome , and mental retardation . We describe here a family with a wide variation in neuropsychiatric illness associated with a deletion of exons 4 , 5 , and 6 of NLGN4 . The proband is an autistic boy with a motor tic . His brother has Tourette syndrome and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder . Their mother , a carrier , has a learning disorder , anxiety , and depression . This family demonstrates that NLGN4 mutations can be associated with a wide spectrum of neuropsychiatric conditions and that carriers may be affected with milder symptoms . European Journal of Human Genetics ( 2008 ) 16 , 614 – 618 ; doi : 10 . 1038 / sj . ejhg . 5202006 ; published online 30 January 2008 Keywords : neuroligin 4 ; autism ; Tourette syndrome ; tic disorder Introduction Neuroligins are a family of adhesion molecules expressed in postsynaptic neurons that interact with neurexins expressed in presynaptic neurons . 1 – 3 The neuroligin – neurexin interaction is hypothesized to play a role in the amount , specificity , and stabilization of synaptic network formation . 4 Studies of knockout mice for NLGN1 , 2 , and 3 support a role in synapse maturation and function . 5 The neurexin family consists of three members ( NRXN1 , NRXN2 , and NRXN3 ) , each with a long a and a short b form . Great variation is achieved through alternative splice variants . 6 Four members of the neuroligin family have been identified in mice ( NLGN1 , NLGN2 , NLGN3 , and NLGN4 ) , while five members of the neuroligin family have been identified in humans : NLGN1 , NLGN2 , NLGN3 , NLGN4 , and NLGN4Y . 1 , 7 , 8 NLGN3 and NLGN4 are both X - linked , with loci at Xq13 and Xp22 . 33 , respectively . Mutations in these two genes have been reported in eight families that include members with mental retardation and / or pervasive developmental disorders ranging across the spectrum from Asperger syndrome to autism ( Table 1 ) . 9 – 12 One report also makes note of a carrier mother affected with a learning disorder . 11 Furthermore , mutations in NRXN1 have been detected in four patients with autism . 13 Several studies , however , have failed to detect a high rate of NLGN mutations in autistic patients , suggesting that NLGN mutations may only be responsible for a small subset of cases of autism . 14 – 17 A study to test for an association between NLGN4 or NLGN4Y and schizo - phrenia , another neuropsychiatric condition , did not yield a strong link either . 18 We have recently identified a family with a novel NLGN4 deletion encompassing exons 4 , 5 , and 6 . This mutation is predicted to result in a significantly truncated protein . This family shows a wide spectrum of different neuropsychiatric illnesses associated with the same NLGN4 mutation . In addition , it demonstrates that female carriers may also be affected in a milder manner than their male children .

He was born by spontaneous vaginal delivery at full term after an uneventful pregnancy without exposures to known teratogens . His early development appeared unremarkable to parents . By the age of 12 months , he was walking on his own and had spoken his first word . He progressed to a vocabulary of approximately 10 – 15 words ; however , around the age of 2 years , his language regressed and his behavior changed . His family had difficulty in making eye contact with him , and he began to show some repetitive movements , including hand waving and placing his fingers in his ears . In addition , he developed a tic disorder consisting of a jerking of the head and arms . An EEG to evaluate seizure activity was normal . Clinical evaluation confirmed that he met DSM - IV criteria for the diagnosis of autism . Cognitively , he was severely retarded . Medically , the patient has been otherwise relatively healthy , with the exception of recurrent otitis media requiring tympanostomy tubes . Physical examination was notable for a double hair whorl , upslanting palpebral fissures , and a slightly broad , depressed nasal root . Head circumference at the age of 7 years was 53cm ( 75th percentile ) . The family was of Irish and English ancestry . The patient had one sibling , a 9 - year - old brother diagnosed with Tourette syndrome and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder with mild cognitive deficits . He was treated with depakote , risperdol , and cogentin , which reportedly im - proved the symptoms of Tourette syndrome . The mother has a learning disability , as well as depression and anxiety treated with sertraline . The maternal grandmother has anxiety . The paternal grandfather was deceased with no suggestive medical or psychiatric history . The father does not have any psychiatric , autistic , or cognitive issues either in himself or in his extended family . Routine chromosome analysis revealed a normal karyo - type of 46 , XY . A chromosome microarray ( Signature Genomics Laboratory ) revealed a small deletion at Xp22 . 3 . No other deletions or abnormalities were detected by the microarray . The deletion was located approximately 1Mb from the steroid sulfatase locus , leaving this region intact . To further delineate the nature of the deletion , we proceeded with analysis of the NLGN4 gene located at Xp22 . 33 . This revealed a deletion encompassing exons 4 , 5 , and 6 ( Figure 1a and b ) . Sequencing across the break point confirmed that the deletion encompasses 756797bp ( Chr . X 5935194 - 5179398 , UCSC Genome Browser on Human , March 2006 Assembly ) , and that there are currently no other known genes in the deleted region ( Figures 2 and 3 ) . Chromosome analysis of the mother and the father showed normal 46 , XX and 46 , XY karyotypes , respectively . Further evaluation of the family showed that his brother and mother both carry this deletion . His mother declined further testing to determine X - chromo - some inactivation status . The maternal grandmother declined testing secondary to severe fear of needle sticks , medical testing , and doctors . It should be noted that no deletions were detected on testing of samples from 96 healthy controls . In addition , specific testing for exon 5 or 6 deletions was negative on another 288 healthy controls . Materials and methods Genomic DNA was extracted from blood using the Puregene kit ( Gentra , Minneapolis , MN , USA ) as per Table 1 Summary of phenotypes associated with NLGN3 and NLGN4 mutations Reference Patient description Mutation Current case Two brothers : one with autism and a motor tic , and one with TS and ADHD .

NLGN4 deletion in autism and Tourette syndrome A Lawson - Yuen et al 615 European Journal of Human Genetics manufacturer’s instructions . The NLGN4 primers were designed to specifically amplify the NLGN4 copy on the X chromosome ( Xp22 . 32 – p22 . 31 ) . A homologous NLGN gene is found on the Y chromosome ( NLGN4Y , Yq11 . 221 ) . All seven exons were amplified in nine amplicons ( exons 2 , 5 , and 6 are amplified in two segments ) . PCR was performed using the AmpliTaq Gold with GeneAmp PCR kit ( Roche , Branchburg , NJ , USA ) , as per the manufacturer’s instructions . PCR products were verified by agarose gel electrophoresis . Amplification abnormalities were confirmed in a second independent PCR amplification . Cycle sequencing was performed using the Big Dye Terminator kit , v1 . 1 ( Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA , USA ) , as per the manufacturer’s instructions . Cycle sequencing products were purified using the CleanSeq magnetic bean purification kit ( Agencourt , Beverly , MA , USA ) . Purified products were run an on Applied Biosystems 3730 automated fluorescent sequencer . Discussion Neuroligins are an intriguing study target for neuro - psychiatric conditions due to their potential role in synapse function and neuron - to - neuron recognition . Lack of expression of specific neuroligins could affect neuronal interactions within the synaptic network , leading to consequent neuropathology . Figure 2 NLGN4 deletion junction . Primer sets of varying distances downstream of exon 3 were used to narrow down the breakpoint junction . Amplification across the deletion junction showed a sequence of y aaaagac ^ TCCTCAT y , which represents a deletion of 756797bp ( Chr . X 5935194 - 5178398 ) . Figure 1 PCR amplifications of NLGN4 exons 1 – 6 . ( a ) Exons 1 – 6 were amplified in parallel ( two separate preparations from the same sample marked as A and B ) for the proband , and a control case with a whole gene deletion of NLGN4 was used . The control is a male subject with a large deletion confirmed by FISH studies on chromosome X that encompasses NLGN4 . Exons 2 , 5 , and 6 were amplified in two segments due to their size . A sample from a healthy subject containing a normal copy of NLGN4 was used for the positive control lane . The water sample contained no DNA template , serving as a negative control for contamination . Cross - amplification was seen in some segments for the proband ( exon 5 segment 2 and exon 6 segment 1 ) due to a homologous NLGN copy on the Y chromosome ( NLGN4Y ) . ( b ) Confirmation that these cross - amplified products were in fact NLGN4Y was demonstrated by direct sequencing of these products . NL4 - E06U2 is the control sequence for the upstream read of exon 6 segment 1 of NLGN4 . The sequence obtained from the exon 6 segment 1 PCR products from the proband’s sample showed the NLGN4Y sequence fingerprint ( see boxed area ) , confirming that there was cross - amplification of the Y copy due to the deletion of X copy . The fingerprint is based on a number of single - nucleotide differences between NLGN4 and NLGN4Y . The same was found for both exon 5 segment 2 products ( data not shown ) . NLGN4 deletion in autism and Tourette syndrome A Lawson - Yuen et al 616 European Journal of Human Genetics This family’s varied neuropsychiatric phenotypes suggest that mutations in NLGN4 may be associated with a wider clinical spectrum than previously described , including depression , anxiety , and tic disorders . Their varied pheno - types , all associated with the same mutation , suggest that epigenetic factors play a role in determining presentation . This also suggests that derangement of core elements of synapse function may be associated with multiple neuro - psychiatric conditions . Gene dosage may be integral to neuroligin function as suggested by the mother’s relatively mild symptoms ( as compared with her sons ) of a learning disorder , anxiety , and depression . Knowledge of the mother’s X - chromosome inactivation status would be valuable in this interpretation , but was unfortunately not available . This may have important genetic counseling implications , as carrier mothers with mild symptoms may be at risk to have severely affected offspring .
