L - plastin is a leukocyte - speciﬁc protein that cross - links actin ﬁlaments into tight bundles , increasing the stability of actin - based structures such as podosomes and lamellipodia . While ﬁrst identiﬁed as an abundant cytoplasmic protein in hematopoietically derived cells over 25 years ago , the requirement for L - plastin in multiple functions critical for immunity , such as antigen receptor signaling , adhesion , and motility , has only recently become clear . L - plastin has been identiﬁed as an important component in cellular processes critical for neutrophil , macrophage , osteoclast , eosinophil , and T - and B - lymphocyte biology . Following a brief description of the structure and function of L - plastin , the regulation of immune cell functions by L - plastin will be reviewed in detail . 1 . Introduction The actin cytoskeleton enables numerous cellular processes required for the mammalian immune response . Actin is rap - idly polymerized in response to T - cell receptor signaling , and F - actin provides stability for the contact site between anti - gen - presenting cells and T cells , termed the immunological synapse [ 1 – 4 ] . Actin cytoskeletal elements are also recruited during chemotactic and adhesive responses , processes critical to normal leukocyte tra ﬃ cking and motility [ 5 – 10 ] . Phago - cytosis and intracellular killing of pathogens also relies upon actin cytoskeletal elements [ 11 , 12 ] . While many actin - bind - ing proteins regulate the recruitment and stabilization of the actin cytoskeleton , recent studies have implicated the actin - bundling protein L - plastin ( LPL ) as a critical regulator of actin dynamics in cells of both the adaptive and innate im - mune systems . 2 . LPL Expression , Structure , and Function Plastins , or ﬁmbrins , are actin - bundling proteins critical to actin regulation in eukaryotes . Human ﬁmbrin can comple - ment yeast SAC6 in endocytosis , suggesting a high degree of conservation [ 13 ] . Three isoforms , L - , I - , and T - plastin , comprise the vertebrate plastins . LPL was initially found in transformed human ﬁbroblasts , though it was later recog - nized that normal expression of LPL is restricted to cells of the hematopoietic lineage [ 14 – 18 ] . LPL , also called lym - phocyte cytosolic protein 1 ( LCP1 ) , has been described as one of the 15 most abundant proteins in human monocytes and T cells [ 14 ] . The human isoform I - plastin is expressed in mammalian small intestine , colon , and kidney [ 19 , 20 ] . T - plastin has the broadest tissue distribution and has been found in most cells from solid tissues with replicative po - tential , such as ﬁbroblasts and epithelial cells [ 16 , 18 ] . All three plastins contain two N - terminal EF - hands , homolo - gous to calmodulin - calcium - binding domains , followed by two actin - binding domains ( ABDs ) . Unlike I - and T - plast - in , LPL additionally contains N - terminal sites of serine pho - phorylation ( Figure 1 ) . Plastins bind F - actin through ABDs that each consists of two calponin - homology domains , placing plastins in the α - actinin family . Other α - actinin family members include α - actinin , ﬁlamin , spectrin , dystrophin , and actin - binding protein 120 [ 16 , 21 ] . Plastins are unique among these family members in that they contain two tandem ABDs on the same polypeptide . These tandem ABDs are thought to fold into a compact , horseshoe - like structure that can simultaneously 2 International Journal of Cell Biology “headpiece” CH4 CH3 CH2 CH1 EF EF ABD1 ABD2 Figure 1 : Schematic of the structure of LPL . The N - terminal “head - piece” contains at least one serine phosphorylation site ( arrow ; ser - ine residue 5 ) and EF hand loops ( labeled “EF” ) that are thought to participate in the calcium regulation of LPL . The C - terminal portion contains two tandem ABDs , each of which consists of two calponin - homology ( CH ) domains , which are numbered . bind two actin ﬁlaments , thus cross - linking the ﬁlaments into tight bundles [ 22 ] . An atomic model of actin ﬁlament bundling by T - plastin was generated through electron mi - croscopy of 2D actin arrays polymerized in the presence or absence of T - plastin on lipid bilayers [ 23 , 24 ] . Bundled actin arrays were unipolar , with about 120 ˚A between ﬁlaments , and bundling may generate hexagonal lattices [ 24 ] . Incor - poration of T - plastin into actin bundles occurred primarily during actin polymerization ; cross - linking of ﬁlaments was irregular when preformed actin ﬁlaments were incubated with T - plastin . T - plastin - bundled ﬁlaments could bend at sites of T - plastin cross - links , likely through changes in the twist of the bound actin ﬁlament [ 24 ] . While LPL is thought to bundle actin in a manner similar to the homologous T - plastin ( Figure 2 ) , direct conﬁrmation through experimental demonstration has been elusive . Imag - ing of actin ﬁlaments has been limited by the intrinsic disor - der of F - actin , as ﬁlaments contain variable twist and tilt of actin subunits . This limitation was overcome by using high - resolution cryoelectron microscopy to image the binding of LPL to F - actin [ 25 ] . These images of LPL - decorated F - actin revealed that binding of the ABD2 of LPL reduced the variability in actin twist and resulted in a more “closed” con - formation of the nucleotide - binding cleft in actin subunit . As an “open” conformation of the nucleotide - binding cleft is correlated with depolymerization and actin ﬁlament instability , “closure” of the cleft by LPL o ﬀ ers a molecular understanding of prior results indicating that LPL binding stabilized the polymerized actin ﬁlament [ 26 ] . The interac - tion of the ABD1 of LPL with F - actin was too variable to be described using the same technique of cryo - electron micro - scopy , although a prior report indicated that the binding of ABD1 of LPL likely resembles the binding of α - actinin [ 25 , 26 ] . It is unclear whether the ABD1 or the ABD2 of LPL ﬁrst binds to F - actin [ 25 , 26 ] . While the exact molecular mechanism of LPL bundling to F - actin remains to be exper - imentally delineated , the binding sites of ABD1 and ABD2 have been described [ 26 ] , and it seems likely that LPL func - tions similarly to T - plastin in cross - linking ﬁlaments [ 24 ] . No molecular function beyond actin bundling has been described for LPL . However , as outlined below , peptides derived from the N - terminus of LPL lacking ABD domains can promote changes in cell functions , such as integrin avid - ity and cell adhesion . These results suggest that LPL may play a role as an adaptor or a sca ﬀ olding protein in signaling in addition to its actin - bundling activity , roles that require further experimental elucidation . Also , as will be discussed below , the details of mechanisms by which actin bundling 1 2 3 4 L - plastin G - actin subunit Actin ﬁlament Figure 2 : LPL folds into a compact structure that bundles actin ﬁlaments . Numbers indicate each CH domain . Based on available experimental data , it has been proposed that ABD2 binds to a polymerizing actin ﬁlament such that the nucleotide - binding cleft adopts a more “closed” position , thus stabilizing the ﬁlament . Bind - ing of ABD1 to an adjacent ﬁlament cross - links F - actin into tight bundles . may promote or restrain immune cell functions have not yet been fully described . 3 . Regulation of LPL Regulation of the bundling of activity of LPL has been demonstrated to occur through both calcium binding and serine phosphorylation . LPL is phosphorylated in multiple cell types primarily at serine residue 5 following a variety of stimuli , including IL - 1 , IL - 2 , lipopolysaccharide , fMet - Leu - Phe , Fc γ R ligation , and PMA [ 27 – 31 ] . To study the e ﬀ ect of serine phosphorylation on the binding of LPL to F - actin , the serine 5 residue was mutated to either a nonphosphorylatable alanine residue ( S5A mutant ) or to a glutamic acid residue ( S5E mutant ) , that mimicked constitutive phosphorylation [ 32 ] . Wild - type and mutant LPL were expressed in Vero cells , which do not express endogenous LPL . Phosphorylation of LPL was found to enhance the targeting of LPL to F - actin rich structures and regions of rapid actin assembly , including membrane ru ﬄ es and microspikes . Phosphorylation of LPL increased its binding to F - actin , as the S5E mutant LPL had a much higher actin - bundling activity than did wild - type LPL [ 32 ] . Analysis of ﬂuorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) of GFP - tagged wild - type and S5A mutant LPL in Vero cells revealed that phosphorylation of LPL increased its localization to focal adhesion sites and reduced its lateral mo - bility , again suggesting an increase in binding of phosphory - lated LPL to F - actin [ 33 ] . Phosphorylated LPL also reduced the turnover of actin ﬁlaments in focal adhesions to a greater extent than non - phosphorylatable LPL , although nonphos - phorylatable LPL also stabilized F - actin [ 33 ] . Thus , when ec - topically expressed in Vero cells , serine phosphorylation may directly regulate the bundling function of LPL . International Journal of Cell Biology 3 LPL may di ﬀ er from I - and T - plastin in that calcium binding negatively regulates LPL - bundling activity [ 34 ] . In an in vitro assay , it was determined that calcium concentra - tions of greater than 10 − 6 M reduced the binding of LPL to F - actin , while LPL binding to F - actin was intact at concen - trations of less than 10 − 7 M calcium [ 34 ] . Calcium binding may induce conformational changes in LPL , thus altering its actin - binding ability [ 22 ] . Phosphoinositides have also been reported to reduce the interaction between LPL and actin ﬁlaments [ 26 ] . LPL may also be regulated through direct binding by other proteins . For instance , binding of the protein - ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 ( Iba1 ) to LPL in macro - phages enhanced the bundling capability of LPL , indepen - dently of the intrinsic bundling capability of Iba1 [ 35 ] . Iba1 is a macrophage - speciﬁc , actin - bundling protein that local - izes to membrane ru ﬄ es and participates in phagocytosis [ 35 ] . Binding of LPL to cortactin has been described in Vero cells in which LPL has been ectopically expressed [ 33 ] . The macrophage - speciﬁc protein grancalcin may bind LPL di - rectly [ 36 ] , and vimentin and LPL are complexed in adherent macrophages [ 37 ] . Finally , calmodulin binding may a ﬀ ect the function of LPL in stimulated T cells [ 38 ] . Whether the binding of cortactin , grancalcin , or calmodulin modulates the bundling capacity of LPL has not been determined . Despite much work on the various mechanisms by which LPL may be regulated , an integrated description of how these mechanisms interact during a speciﬁc cell process in a specif - ic cell type , such as macrophage adhesion , has not emerged . Such an integrated description is challenging , because the regulation of LPL likely varies from cell type to cell type and from stimulus to stimulus . In fact , di ﬀ erent receptors for the same stimulus can regulate LPL via di ﬀ erent signaling path - ways [ 39 ] . However , given the abundance of LPL in hemato - poietic cells , and its recruitment into a wide variety of proc - esses critical to immune function , a more thorough explora - tion of the regulation of LPL is warranted . 4 . LPL Regulates Integrin Function in Neutrophils The most extensive characterization of a role for LPL in hematopoietic cells has been performed in neutrophils . Criti - cal to the immediate , innate host defense , neutrophils rely on complex interactions between Fc receptors , chemoattractant receptors , and integrins to guide neutrophil maturation , traf - ﬁcking , and degranulation [ 40 ] . Regulation of integrin avid - ity through inside - out signaling and integrin - mediated out - side - in signaling is crucial to e ﬀ ective neutrophil function [ 41 – 43 ] . The predominance of evidence indicates that LPL participates in both inside - out and outside - in signaling [ 29 , 44 ] , although LPL may also function downstream of Fc γ R in some systems . LPL was initially recognized in neutrophils as a target of phosphorylation following stimulation with IL - 8 or the chemoattractant peptide fMet - Leu - Phe [ 45 , 46 ] . LPL was independently found to be a downstream mediator of Fc γ R signaling when LPL was identiﬁed as a target of bromo - phenacyl bromide ( BPB ) [ 47 ] . BPB inhibited Fc γ R - mediated calcium ﬂux and diminished neutrophil degranulation , ad - herence , and phagocytosis . BPB - mediated inhibition of Fc γ R signaling correlated with the binding of BPB to LPL . Intrigu - ingly , BPB did not prevent the Fc γ R - stimulation binding of LPL to F - actin , suggesting that LPL may have a function be - yond that of actin bundling in Fc γ R signaling in neutrophils [ 47 ] . Further work revealed that Fc γ RII activation through bead - or plate - bound immune complexes induced phos - phorylation of the N - terminal headpiece of LPL , while stim - ulation with soluble immune complexes did not [ 48 ] . Im - mune complexes consisted of bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) bound with varying concentrations of anti - BSA antibodies . Phosphorylation of LPL under conditions in which cells had to reorganize to engage with a ﬁxed ligand but not in re - sponse to simple receptor triggering by a soluble ligand sug - gested that LPL may be involved in the cellular shape change induced by binding to ﬁxed ligands [ 48 ] . Furthermore , plate - bound immune complexes also induced the movement of LPL to podosomes . However , LPL phosphorylation occurred independently of the translocation to podosomes , calcium ﬂux , and actin polymerization . Blockade of the integrin α M β 2 ( also called CR3 , Mac - 1 , and CD11b / CD18 ) did not a ﬀ ect LPL phosphorylation , but did reduce the translocation of LPL to the podosomes on immune complex coated sur - faces [ 48 ] . Thus , it was not clear in early work whether the phosphorylation of LPL promoted association with F - actin in neutrophils stimulated through plate - bound Fc γ R , and the precise regulation and function of LPL in neutrophils adhering to surface - bound ligands remain to be fully de - scribed . A mechanistic link between phosphorylation of LPL and activation of the integrin α M β 2 in neutrophils was revealed in human neutrophils treated with a cell - permeable synthetic peptide derived from the N - terminal headpiece of LPL [ 29 ] . Signals that generate changes in integrin adhesion also trig - gered LPL phosphorylation ; LPL phosphorylation in neutro - phils could be induced by both PI3K - dependent Fc γ R sig - naling and by PI3K - independent f - Met - Leu - Phe and PMA stimulation . The serine 5 residue in the N - terminus of LPL was identiﬁed as the primary target of phosphorylation in these signaling pathways . A synthetic peptide derived from residues 2 – 19 of the N - terminus of LPL was fused at the car - boxy terminus to the HIV tat protein , which enabled sponta - neous translocation of the LPL peptide across the cell mem - brane . Treatment of neutrophils with the wild - type sequence of LPL was su ﬃ cient to induce adhesion of neutrophils to surfaces coated with fetal calf serum , a process mediated through the activation of the integrin α M β 2 . Treatment with a constitutively phosphorylated synthetic LPL peptide also induced adhesion , while mutation of the serine residue at position 5 to alanine to prevent phosphorylation abrogated the induction of neutrophil adhesion . Induction of adhesion by wild - type LPL tat but not by constitutively phosphorylated LPL tat could be inhibited by blocking PI3K and PKC , indi - cating that phosphorylation of LPL through these signaling pathways was likely necessary for the ability of LPL to induce activation of α M β 2 and thus neutrophil adhesion [ 29 ] . Ad - ditionally , blockade of LPL phosphorylation by treatment with the PKA - inhibitor H89 correlated with inhibition of 4 International Journal of Cell Biology adhesion to immune complex coated surfaces and likely in - hibited activation of α M β 2 [ 49 ] . Induction of integrin activation was conﬁrmed and ex - tended through the examination of activation of α v β 3 in the human erythroleukemic cell line K562 , which enabled anal - ysis of the function of LPL in a well - established system of activable integrin adhesion [ 50 ] . Similar to the observation that a synthetic LPL peptide could upregulate the adhesion of α M β 2 in neutrophils [ 29 ] , treatment of K562 cells express - ing α v β 3 with the LPL tat peptide promoted integrin acti - vation and cellular adhesion to surfaces coated with the in - tegrin ligand vitronectin [ 50 ] . LPL tat activation of α v β 3 was independent of the tyrosine phosphorylation of the cytoplas - mic tail of the integrin β chain , indicating that LPL activates integrins in a mechanism di ﬀ erent from that of PMA stim - ulation . LPL tat treatment of cells triggered a conformation change in the integrin , revealing ligand - induced binding sites on the integrin that increased its avidity for its ligand . Changes in integrin avidity required actin depolymerization [ 50 ] . These results conﬁrmed that the action of LPL was not restricted to one speciﬁc integrin , and further elucidated the mechanism by which LPL can activate integrins in neutro - phils and K562 cells . Whether LPL bound directly to inte - grins α M β 2 and α v β 3 was not examined in these studies . However , LPL has recently been reported to exist in com - plexes with either β 1 or β 2 integrins in breast and prostate cancer cells , consistent with the proposal that LPL can direct - ly regulate integrin activity [ 21 ] . 5 . Regulation of LPL Phosphorylation in Neutrophils Phosphorylation of LPL has also been linked to generation of NADPH - oxidative burst in neutrophils following stimu - lation with PMA . Both nonphosphorylated and hyperphos - phorylation of LPL correlated with inhibition of PMA - generated NADPH oxidative burst . Optimally phosphorylat - ed LPL correlated with induction of NADPH oxidative burst [ 51 ] . These results suggested turnover of LPL phosphory - lation may be as critical as phosphorylation itself . Whether or not that turnover of LPL phosphorylation functions in the generation of the oxidative burst in response to other extracellular signals has not been investigated in this manner . The kinases that phosphorylate LPL in neutrophils vary with cell stimulus ( Table 1 ) . Immune complex binding trig - gers phosphorylation of LPL at the serine 5 residue through PKA [ 49 ] . However , the inhibitor of PKA , H89 , did not inhibit LPL phosphoryaltion in response to PMA or fMLP stimulation [ 49 ] . Characterization of LPL phosphorylation in response to fMLP revealed multiple signaling pathways that converge at LPL phosphorylation . Inhibitors of PI3K , PLD , and PKC could all reduce LPL phosphorylation in re - sponse to fMLP stimulation , and the recruitment of the dif - ferent kinases depended upon whether signaling occurred through the high - a ﬃ nity or low - a ﬃ nity receptor of fMLP [ 39 ] . LPL was independently found to be a substrate of phos - phorylation following ligation of the low - a ﬃ nity recep - tor for fMLP , formyl peptide receptor - like 1 ( FPR - L1 ) [ 30 ] . Intriguingly , multiple species of LPL—a 67 kDa , 65 kDa , 62 kDa , and 48 kDa—were isolated from fMLP - stimulated neutrophils . The signﬁcance of these di ﬀ erent molecular weight forms of LPL is completely unknown [ 30 ] . Given the increase in integrin activation and adhesion triggered by the LPL tat peptide , it was somewhat of a surprise to ﬁnd that neutrophils from the LPL − / − mouse were not defective in integrin - mediated adhesion , nor was chemo - taxis of LPL − / − neutrophils diminished [ 44 ] . However , LPL − / − neutrophils were defective in integrin signaling to the kinase Syk . Deﬁcient activation of Syk following integrin ligation led to a defective respiratory burst , resulting in an inability to kill Staphylococcus aureus , and LPL − / − mice were more susceptible to staphylococcal skin abscesses . Signal - ing through both Fc γ R and PMA to the respiratory burst in LPL − / − neutrophils was intact , indicating that integrin signaling was speciﬁcally dependent upon LPL [ 44 ] . These results , combined with those described above , suggest that LPL may be su ﬃ cient to promote changes in integrin adhe - sion , but is not always necessary . However , LPL is required for some aspects of integrin outside - in signaling . 6 . LPL Promotes the Stabilization of the T - Cell Immune Synapse In addition to its role in neutrophil biology , LPL has also been recognized as a substrate of phosphorylation during T - cell receptor signaling to T - cell activation as early as 1994 [ 52 ] . Phosphorylation or redistribution of LPL has been used as a marker of T - cell activation and / or costimulation [ 53 , 54 ] . However , a functional requirement for LPL during T - cell activation has only recently been described [ 55 , 56 ] . T - cell activation is dependent upon the creation of a specialized contact site between the antigen - presenting cell ( APC ) and the responding T - cell [ 57 , 58 ] . Described as both the supramolecular activation complex ( SMAC ) and the im - munological synapse ( IS ) , the creation of this contact site has been extensively reviewed [ 2 , 3 , 59 ] . A role for LPL in the for - mation of the IS was suggested by the ﬁndings that LPL accumulates at the synapse [ 55 ] . Co - stimulation through CD2 or CD28 induced phosphorylation of LPL at serine 5 [ 55 ] . While accumulation of LPL at the IS was independent of its phosphorylation status , overexpression of a mutant of LPL that could not be phosphorylated reduced the export of the T - cell activation markers CD25 and CD69 [ 55 ] . An additional study from the same group further characterized the role of LPL in the formation of the mature IS [ 38 ] . They found that during SMAC formation , LPL primarily colocal - ized with F - actin in the peripheral and / or distal SMAC . As in the previous study , mutation of the serine phosphorylation site at residue 5 had no impact on the ability of LPL to localize to the IS . However , deletion of an ABD or deletion of the calmodulin - binding domain did prevent LPL accumulation at the synapse . Knockdown of LPL through siRNA trans - fection resulted in diminished actin polymerization during synapse formation , reduced recruitment of talin and LFA - 1 to the synapse , and an overall reduction in the size of the syn - apse . Defective IS maintenance correlated with a reduction in International Journal of Cell Biology 5 Table 1 : The kinases that regulate phosphorylation of LPL in response to various cell stimuli are listed , along with the inhibitor used to test the participation of each kinase . The kinases that phosphorylate LPL in other cell types , such as T cells and macrophages , have not yet been deﬁned . References are numbered according to appearance in the text .

Recently , phosphorylation of LPL has been identiﬁed as a target of dexamethasone , o ﬀ ering a novel mechanism for the immunosuppressive e ﬀ ects of this commonly used steroid [ 61 ] . A requirement for LPL in the formation of the immune synapse was independently conﬁrmed through the analysis of murine T cells genetically deﬁcient for LPL [ 56 ] . LPL − / − murine T cells were defective in proliferation and cytokine production when stimulated with plate - bound anti - CD3 or with peptide - pulsed APCs , but not with soluble anti - CD3 . Interestingly , proximal TCR signaling events , such as calcium ﬂux , tyrosine phosphorylation of the adaptor protein LAT , and ERK activation and were intact in stimulated LPL − / − T cells . However , spreading of LPL − / − T cells on anti - CD3 coated surfaces , formation of LPL − / − T - cell : APC conjugates , and generation of the IS in LPL − / − T cells were impaired . These data are all consistent with a model in which LPL is required for later stages of IS formation , stabilization , or maintenance , but is dispensable for early TCR signaling events . A requirement for LPL in later stages of signaling would also be consistent with its identiﬁed functions in sta - bilizing F - actin structures . Defective formation or mainte - nance of the IS likely contributed to the downstream defects in proliferation and cytokine production of LPL − / − T cells [ 56 ] . It is not yet clear whether the requirement for LPL in stabilization of the IS depends upon its actin - bundling activ - ity , e ﬀ ects upon integrin binding or adhesion , binding to calmodulin , or some combination of these potential e ﬀ ector functions . Furthermore , the kinases that phosphorylate LPL and the potential regulation of LPL by calcium , as is suggest - ed by the binding of calmodulin to LPL [ 38 ] , have not yet been fully elucidated in TCR - stimulated T cells . Further - more , while B - cell activation also requires actin rearrange - ment , a role for LPL in B - cell receptor signaling has not yet been fully investigated [ 62 ] . 7 . LPL Is Required for Normal T - and B - Cell Motility Lymphocyte tra ﬃ cking is dependent upon an array of inte - grins and chemoattractant receptors that promote changes in cell polarity , adhesion , and motility [ 8 , 63 – 66 ] . LPL has also been recognized as a critical regulator of T - cell motility , as well as T - cell activation . Like its role in TCR signaling , LPL appears to function as a downstream e ﬀ ector of motility , rather than as a participant in proximal chemokine recep - tor signaling . LPL was identiﬁed along with coronin 1A as one of several actin - binding proteins that move into and then out of chemokine - receptor - associated lipid rafts fol - lowing chemokine signaling . Knockdown of LPL in Jurkat T cells reduced motility towards CCL20 without inhibiting chemokine - stimulated calcium ﬂux [ 67 ] . T cells from LPL − / − mice were also found to have diminished chemoattractant - mediated motility , as assessed by two - photon microscopy in explanted lymph nodes as well as in transwell assays [ 68 ] . The reduction in motility occurred in chemokine - stimulated LPL − / − T cells despite normal activation of the small GTPase Rac , induction of a burst of actin polymerization , and upreg - ulation of cellular adhesiveness thought to be due to integrin activation . Motility reduction correlated with diminished polarization of LPL − / − T cells , which failed to generate clearly delineated uropods and lamellipods seen in chemokine - stimulated WT T cells . Phenotypically , the reduced motility of LPL − / − T cells resulted in diminished thymic egress in LPL − / − mice [ 68 ] . While inhibition of immune cell motility by an inverse agonist of the cannabinoid CB2 receptor cor - related with diminished phosphorylation of LPL [ 69 ] , a requirement for LPL phosphorylation during T - cell chemo - taxis has not yet been formally demonstrated , and whether calmodulin - binding regulates the function or localization of LPL during chemotaxis has not been examined . B cells also require LPL for chemotaxis - mediated motility [ 70 ] . LPL − / − mice were found to be deﬁcient for a specialized population of B cells , called marginal zone B cells . Develop - ment of MZ B cells is exquisitely sensitive to chemotactic and adhesive signaling , and LPL − / − B cells were found to exhibit reduced motility towards the chemoattractants CXCL12 , CXCL13 , and sphingosine - 1 - phosphate . Interestingly , the integrin - mediated increase in cellular motility required LPL , while the chemokine - mediated increase in integrin adhesive - ness did not . As seen before , some downstream elements of chemoattractant receptor signaling did not require LPL , as activation of ERK and p38 were intact in CXCL12 - stim - ulated LPL − / − B cells . However , total protein levels and 6 International Journal of Cell Biology phosphorylation of the integrin - associated kinase Pyk2 were diminished in LPL − / − B cells , providing a possible molecular explanation for the requirement for LPL in lymphocyte motility [ 70 ] . 8 . LPL Is an Early Participant in Sealing Ring Formation of Osteoclasts Osteoclasts are highly specialized , hematopoietically derived cells that maintain bone mass and remodel bone structure through the tightly regulated process of bone resorption [ 71 ] . LPL has been localized to the podosomes of monocyte - de - rived osteoclasts [ 72 ] , and a role for LPL , along with the actin - binding protein cortactin , has been demonstrated in osteoclast sealing ring formation [ 73 ] . Osteoclasts undergo dramatic , actin - based morphologic changes during bone resorption . Osteoclasts initially generate actin aggregates , which are thought to provide traction for membrane exten - sions . These actin aggregates then mature and form a sealing ring . The expression of LPL was found to decrease during the maturation of the sealing ring , while the expression of cortactin increases during the same time period . LPL was found to localize with the actin aggregates during the early process of bone resorption , but not with the mature sealing ring . While an absolute requirement for LPL in the formation of the sealing ring has not yet been formally demonstrated , these results suggest that LPL plays a critical function during osteoclast adhesion [ 73 ] . 9 . LPL Localizes to the Podosomes of Macrophages during Migration LPL was identiﬁed as one of the major constituents of cyto - plasmic gels isolated from alveolar macrophages , along with actin , ﬁlamin , and α - actinin [ 17 ] . LPL was estimated to account for about 1 . 8 % of total cytoplasmic protein in ma - crophages , existing in an approximate 1 : 7 - 8 molar ratio with actin . The authors proposed that calcium regulation of LPL may alter microﬁlament organization in macrophages , as the presence of 20 μ M calcium reduced the a ﬃ nity of LPL for actin by threefold . LPL was also identiﬁed as a heavily phos - phorylated protein in macrophages stimulated with LPS [ 74 ] . As seen in other cell types , the phosphorylation occurs at serine residue 5 of the amino terminus , though the kinase responsible for LPL phosphorylation in LPS - stimulated ma - crophages remains undeﬁned [ 31 , 74 ] . A small amount of constitutively phosphorylated LPL has been reported to asso - ciate with podosomes in macrophages [ 75 ] . The abundance of LPL in macrophage cytoplasm has enabled the imaging of macrophage movement through ﬂuorescently tagged LPL [ 76 ] . Fluorescently tagged LPL has also been used in conjunction with ﬂuorescently labeled actin to analyze podosome assembly and disassembly in macro - phage lamellipodia during migration [ 77 ] . Podosomes are similar to focal adhesions and serve as sites of actin assembly and adhesion during forward movement and are enriched for integrins , vinculin , and talin . Podosomes are relatively short lived , assembling and disassembling in a few minutes . Dynamic changes in F - actin and LPL were tightly associated both geographically and temporally , suggesting close cou - pling between the regulation of the two proteins [ 77 ] . As LPL is incorporated during actin polymerization [ 24 ] , this close coupling in time and space is not surprising . While LPL is certainly an abundant component of podosomes , a re - quirement for actin bundling in normal podosome assembly and function has not yet been reported . LPL has also been reported to bind to macrophage - spe - cific proteins that may be critical to macrophage function . For instance , LPL was found to bind Iba1 in a two - hybrid screen [ 35 ] . The expression of Iba1 , an EF - hand protein , is upregulated in activated microglia and has been reported to be critical for macrophage membrane ru ﬄ ing and phagocy - tosis . Iba1 and LPL co - localize to phagocytic cups . Binding of Iba1 to LPL enhanced LPL bundling activity , independent of the intrinsic bundling ability of Iba1 [ 35 ] . LPL was also found to be a possible binding partner of grancalcin , a member of the penta - EF - hand family [ 78 ] . Grancalcin is expressed primarily in phagocytic cells , such as neutrophils and macro - phages [ 36 ] . Grancalcin colocalized with F - actin in mem - brane spikes of stimulated macrophages [ 36 ] . Unlike LPL − / − neutrophils , grancalcin - deﬁcient neutrophils were able to kill Staphylococcus aureus in vitro , and grancalcin was not re - quired for other immune functions , such as macrophage re - cruitment to sites of inﬂammation or resistance to fungal infections [ 79 ] . The functional association between LPL and grancalcin thus remains undeﬁned . 10 . LPL Mediates GM - CSF Sensitization of Eosinophils A function of LPL in receptor signaling events beyond its capacity as an actin - bundling protein has been suggested by a recent report that LPL may regulate GM - CSF - mediated sensitization of eosinophils [ 60 ] . GM - CSF stimulation pro - moted the phosphorylation of LPL and the association of LPL with protein kinase C β II and two subunits of the GM - CSF receptor . Treatment with GM - CSF resulted in increased expression of the integrin α M β 2 , increased sensitivity to eotaxin in a chemotaxis assay , prolonged survival of eosin - ophils , and primed eosinophils for degranulation . Inhibition of PKC β II resulted in the reduction of LPL phosphorylation and the loss of these GM - CSF - stimulated e ﬀ ects . Most im - portantly , internalization of a constitutively phosphorylated LPL peptide ( residues 2 – 19 ) by eosinophils resulted in in - creased α M β 2 integrin expression and sensitization to chem - otaxis , suggesting a mechanistic link between phosphoryla - tion of LPL and GM - CSF - induced sensitization to chemo - taxis [ 60 ] . The induction of increased α M β 2 integrin expres - sion by the N - terminal portion of LPL , which does not contain ABDs , suggests that LPL may have intrinsic signaling capabilities that do not require actin - bundling functions . 11 . LPL May Promote the Invasive Potential of Transformed Cells LPL is ectopically expressed in many tumor cells , and its function in the potential promotion of invasive potential International Journal of Cell Biology 7 of transformed cells has been extensively reviewed [ 80 ] . In brief , a survey of 59 human tumor cell lines revealed ectopic expression of LPL in 66 % of epithelial - derived carcinomas and 53 % of mesenchymal tumors [ 18 ] . Expression of LPL has been correlated with higher stages of colorectal cancer [ 81 ] , and ectopic expression of LPL in a colon cancer cell line promoted proliferation and invasion [ 82 ] . While total expression of LPL did not correlate with staging of breast cancer [ 83 ] , the phosphorylation of LPL enabled breast can - cer cell line resistance to TNF - α [ 84 ] . The invasive potential of human melanoma cells was enhanced by the phosphory - lation of ectopically expressed LPL [ 85 ] . Blockade of LPL by the overexpression of an alpaca - derived nanobody reduces invasion of prostate carcinoma cells in a matrigel invasion assay [ 86 ] . Finally , a nonphosphorylatable mutant of LPL was unable to promote collagen gel invasion of HEK293T cells [ 32 ] . Combined , these results suggest that LPL may function in the formation of actin - based structures that facilitate the metastatic potential of transformed cells [ 80 ] . 12 . Toward an Integrated Model of LPL Despite 25 years of research , an integrated understanding of the function of LPL in hematopoietic cells remains elusive . A clear description of the role of LPL has been frustrated by the inherent technical di ﬃ culties of analyzing the rapid , transient , and subcellular events of receptor signaling , adhe - sion , and motility that are dependent upon the highly dy - namic actin cytoskeleton . Advances in imaging technology will address these di ﬃ culties . Additionally , the requirement for LPL may vary with cell type and cell stimulus , as LPL was required for chemoattractant - mediated motility of lympho - cytes [ 68 , 70 ] , but not migration of neutrophils [ 44 ] . It may be that the di ﬀ erential requirement for LPL in lymphocytes and neutrophils results from the utilization of di ﬀ erent modes of motility [ 10 , 87 ] . It is also possible that the differ - ential requirement for LPL in distinct cell types results from disparate expression patterns of LPL - binding proteins , such as grancalcin [ 36 ] . Furthermore , it has not yet been estab - lished whether LPL regulates receptor signaling , adhesion , and motility solely through its actin - bundling function or if LPL can also act as an adaptor protein in signaling cascades . A function for LPL beyond actin - bundling has been recently suggested by the observation that LPL binds directly to the cytoplasmic portion of integrins β 1 and β 2 though the ABDs [ 21 ] . This interaction between LPL and integrins β 1 and β 2 may be regulated by μ - calpain cleavage [ 21 ] . LPL was also identiﬁed in a screen for proteins upregulated in a leukemic cell line that constitutively maintains integrins in an activated state [ 88 ] . A critical role for LPL in integrin sig - naling would reconcile a number of otherwise apparently disparate observations . For instance , stabilization of the IS in T cells , the adhesion - mediated triggering of the NADPH oxidative burst in neutrophils , and the stabilization of F - actin in the podosomes of macrophages are all integrin - mediated events [ 38 , 44 , 56 , 77 ] . The requirement for LPL in signal - ing has often been revealed when suspension cells , such as neutrophils or T cells , were stimulated with surface - bound , but not soluble , ligand , consistent with the proposal that LPL functions primarily in transmitting adhesion - generated signals [ 48 , 56 ] . The demonstration of defective polarization of chemokine - stimulated LPL − / − T cells was performed on a surface coated with integrin ligand [ 68 ] . Whether LPL regu - lates “inside - out” integrin signaling may be cell type depen - dent . LPL upregulated integrin avidity in neutrophils [ 29 ] , but upregulation of integrin avidity following chemokine stimulation was not LPL - dependent in lymphocytes [ 68 , 70 ] . Integrin outside - in signaling required LPL in both lympho - cytes and neutrophils [ 44 , 68 , 70 ] . Whether LPL links inte - grins directly to the actin cytoskeleton or serves as an adaptor protein in a larger molecular complex remains unclear . Mutations in cytoskeletal proteins , such as Wiskott - Aldrich Syndrome protein , coronin , DOCK8 and Rac2 , result in human immunodeﬁciency [ 89 – 92 ] . Whether mutations in or allelic forms of LPL contribute to human immunodeﬁ - ciency is an open question . One of the ﬁrst reports of LPL noted an alternatively expressed form in one of nine patients examined [ 14 ] . It does not appear that this observation has been clariﬁed in the intervening decades . Given the now ex - tensive evidence that LPL plays critical functions in macro - phage , neutrophil , eosinophil , and lymphocyte biology , fur - ther investigation of a role for LPL in infection and immunity is well warranted .
