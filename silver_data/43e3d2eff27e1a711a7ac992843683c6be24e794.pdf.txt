The proinflammatory effects of CD95L have raised questions about its contribution to immune privilege ( 3 , 5 , 16 ) , tolerance , and graft survival ( 8 – 10 ) . Although it triggers apoptosis in T lymphocytes ( 2 ) ( Fig . 2D ) , CD95L unexpectedly stimulated PMN acti - vation . As described for other PMN stimu - lants ( 17 ) , this activity is dependent on its ability to enhance p38 MAPK activity ( Fig . 3 ) . PMNs directly mediate cytolysis of CD95L 1 cells , and this effect is inhibited by TGF - b , which is present in the aqueous hu - mor ( 13 ) . TGF - b also plays a role in immune tolerance through this mechanism and its ef - fect on T cell proliferation . Although it inhib - its p38 MAPK activity in other cells ( 18 ) , its effect on innate immune responses mediated by neutrophils was previously unknown . To - gether CD95L and TGF - b promote lympho - cyte clonal deletion and suppress inflamma - tion . Thus , providing a microenvironment that includes both of these elements may aid in amelioration of allograft rejection at non - privileged sites . Both CD95L and TGF - b 1 have also been detected in tumors , particular - ly in the extracellular matrix , where they may inhibit immunologic recognition of malig - nancies ( 6 , 19 ) . Successful immune therapies for cancer are likely to require strategies to reverse this mechanism of immune suppres - sion in vivo . References and Notes 1 . N .

However , only immunoglobulin - dependent uptake results in a respiratory burst and an in(cid:223)ammatory response in macro - phages . Rho guanosine triphosphatases ( molecular switches that control the organization of the actin cytoskeleton ) were found to be essential for both types of phagocytosis . Two distinct mechanisms of phagocytosis were iden - ti(cid:222)ed : Type I , used by the immunoglobulin receptor , is mediated by Cdc42 and Rac , and type II , used by the complement receptor , is mediated by Rho . These results suggest a molecular basis for the different biological consequences that are associated with phagocytosis . Phagocytosis is the process by which cells recognize and engulf large particles ( . 0 . 5 m m ) and is important to host defense mech - anisms as well as to tissue repair and mor - phogenetic remodeling . Two of the best char - acterized phagocytic receptors in macro - phages , the complement receptor 3 ( CR3 ) and Fc gamma receptors ( Fc g Rs ) , are in - volved in the uptake of opsonized microor - ganisms during infection . CR3 binds C3bi on complement - opsonized targets , whereas Fc g Rs bind to immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) – coated targets . Phagocytosis by both types of receptors is driven by the reorganization of filamentous actin ( F - actin ) , but the mecha - nisms of uptake appear to be different ( 1 , 2 ) . First , Fc g R - mediated uptake is accompanied by pseudopod extension and membrane ruf - fling , whereas complement - opsonized targets sink into the cell , producing little protrusive activity ( 3 ) . Second , Fc g R ligation is accom - panied by the activation of the respiratory burst ( to produce reactive oxygen species ) and by the production of arachidonic acid metabolites and cytokines , such as tumor ne - crosis factor – a . C3bi - dependent uptake oc - curs in the absence of any of these proinflam - matory signals ( 4 – 6 ) . The Rho family of small guanosine triphos - phatases ( GTPases ) is involved in the reorgani - zation of filamentous actin structures in re - sponse to extracellular stimuli ( 7 ) . Rho induces the assembly of contractile actomyosin fila - ments , whereas Rac and Cdc42 control actin polymerization into lamellipodial and filopodial membrane protrusions , respectively ( 8 , 9 ) . In addition , these GTPases can affect gene tran - scription [ through the activation of nuclear factor kappa B , through the c - Jun NH 2 - terminal kinase ( JNK ) , and through the p38 mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) ] , and Rac regulates the reduced form of nic - otinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate ( NADPH ) oxidase enzyme complex that is responsible for the respiratory burst ( 10 , 11 ) . We have , therefore , analyzed the rela - tive roles of Rho , Rac , and Cdc42 in Fc g R - and CR3 - mediated phagocytosis .

To analyze the effects of Fc g R and CR3 receptor activation on actin , we microinjected quiescent cells with either a plasmid encoding the single Fc g RIIA chain or with a combination of plas - mids encoding the two chains of the CR3 inte - grin receptor ( CD11b and CD18 ) ( 12 ) . Surface expression of the receptors , visualized by im - munofluorescence 2 hours after microinjection , did not in itself affect cell morphology or F - actin distribution ( Fig . 1A ) . However , antibody cross - linking of Fc g RII resulted in the forma - tion ( within 10 min ) of filopodia , accompanied by localized ruffles ( Fig . 1B ) . After 30 min , cells harboring cross - linked Fc g R showed a contracted morphology and contained stress fi - bers . Antibody cross - linking of CR3 induced rapid cell contraction and F - actin reorganiza - tion into stress fibers with no evidence of filop - odia or lamellipodial protrusions ( Fig . 1C ) . To determine whether changes in the actin cytoskeleton were mediated by the activation of Rho GTPases , we expressed the phagocytic receptors along with inhibitors of Rho , Rac , or Cdc42 . Coinjection of a dominant negative Cdc42 construct blocked the formation of all filamentous actin structures upon Fc g RIIA li - gation ( Fig . 1D ) , whereas dominant negative Rac blocked ruffling and stress fibers but not filopodia . With CR3 , dominant negative Cdc42 or Rac constructs had no effect on the induced actin changes , whereas the Rho inhibitor ( C3 transferase ) blocked all actin changes . Thus , Fc g RIIA cross - linking specifically results in the activation of Cdc42 , which in turn activates a previously described Cdc42 - Rac - Rho cascade ( 8 , 9 ) . However , cross - linking of the integrin receptor CR3 activates only Rho . As a first step toward analyzing the role of Rho GTPases in phagocytosis , plasmids en - coding Fc g RII or CR3 receptors were trans - fected into COS cells . Cells were then pre - sented with red blood cells ( RBCs ) that were opsonized with either IgG ( for Fc g R ) or C3bi ( for CR3 ) , and the efficiency of particle in - ternalization was determined ( 13 , 14 ) . Nine - ty - seven percent of Fc g R - expressing COS cells were able to bind IgG - opsonized cells , and ; 60 % of expressing cells contained one or more internalized particles ( Fig . 1E ) . Co - transfection of the two chains of the CR3 receptor resulted in 70 % of CR3 - expressing cells binding to opsonized particles , and ; 50 % of these showed one or more internal - ized particles . Both chains of the CR3 recep - tor were needed for the efficient binding and ingestion of complement - opsonized cells ( Fig . 1E ) . Next , both phagocytic receptors were cotransfected with dominant negative versions of Rho , Rac , or Cdc42 or with the specific Rho inhibitor ( C3 transferase ) . None of the inhibitors had any substantial effect on the binding of opsonized RBCs to either CR3 - or Fc g R - expressing COS cells ( Fig . 1E ) . Dominant negative Cdc42 and dominant negative Rac ( Fig . 1E ) showed no inhibitory effect on the phagocytic behavior of CR3 - transfected COS cells , whereas both domi - nant negative Rho and C3 transferase showed essentially complete inhibition of CR3 - medi - ated phagocytosis ( Fig . 1E ) . For Fc g R - medi - ated phagocytosis , dominant negative Rho and C3 transferase had no effect , whereas dominant negative Cdc42 and dominant neg - ative Rac abolished particle internalization ( Fig . 1E ) . Thus , CR3 - mediated phagocytosis in COS cells is mediated by Rho , and Fc g R - mediated phagocytosis is mediated by a com - bination of Cdc42 and Rac . To determine whether Rho GTPases con - trol phagocytosis in professional phagocytic cells , we treated the mouse macrophage cell line J774 with toxin B from Clostridium dif - ficile , an inhibitor of all members of the Rho family ( 15 ) . A pretreatment ( 2 hours ) with toxin B inhibited ( in a dose - dependent man - ner ) both CR3 - and Fc g R - mediated phagocy - tosis but had no effect on the initial binding of opsonized targets to J774 macrophages ( 15 ) . To identify the specific GTPases in - volved , we microinjected J774 cells with plasmids that encoded inhibitors of Rho , Rac , and Cdc42 ( 16 ) . Representative examples of the results that were obtained for Fc g R - me - diated phagocytosis are shown ( Fig . 2 , A through H ) . C3 transferase – expressing cells ( Fig . 2 , C , D , and I ) or dominant negative Rho – expressing cells were as competent as control cells ( Fig . 2 , A , B , and I ) at internal - izing IgG - opsonized RBCs , which appear as swollen particles in vacuoles ( 14 ) . In con - trast , macrophages expressing dominant neg - ative Rac ( Fig . 2 , E , F , and I ) or dominant negative Cdc42 ( Fig . 2G , H and I ) were unable to carry out Fc g R - mediated phagocy - tosis , as attested by the crenated morphology of the RBCs ( 14 ) . As an alternative to using dominant negative proteins , the Cdc42 - bind - ing domain of a specific Cdc42 target protein , Wiscott - Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) ( 17 ) , was also used , which completely pre - vented Fc g R - mediated phagocytosis ( Fig . 2I ) . In agreement with the results presented here , an earlier report showed that both Rac Fig . 1 .

Another report , however , suggested that Rho is also required for Fc g R uptake , but in those experiments , Rho inhibition prevented even the binding of opsonized particles ( 19 ) . Representative examples of the results that were obtained for CR3 - mediated phagocytosis are shown ( Fig . 3 ) . In this case , macrophages expressing dominant negative Rac ( Fig . 3 , E , F , and I ) or dominant negative Cdc42 ( Fig . 3 , G through I ) were as competent as control cells [ Fig . 3 , A , B , and I ( left ) ] at internalizing com - plement - opsonized RBCs . C3 transferase – ex - pressing cells ( Fig . 3I ) or dominant negative Rho – expressing cells ( Fig . 3 , C and D ) , how - ever , were unable ( up to 90 % inhibition ) to carry out CR3 - mediated phagocytosis . Thus , Fc g R receptors activate Cdc42 and Rac , and both these GTPases ( but not Rho ) are required for phagocytosis . CR3 - mediated phagocytosis occurs through a distinct cellular mechanism and is dependent on Rho ( but not dependent on Rac or Cdc42 ) . To determine whether Rho GTPases are differentially recruited to phagosomes sur - rounding IgG - or complement - opsonized parti - cles , we analyzed their association with inter - nalized particles . In the absence of antibody reagents that were sufficiently sensitive to vi - sualize all three endogenous Rho GTPases in J774 macrophages , the behavior of wild - type , tagged GTPases was analyzed in the COS cell phagocytosis assay . Opsonized particles that were internalized through either CR3 or Fc g R expressed in COS cells were both associated with F - actin . Coexpression of the Fc g R recep - tor with Myc - tagged versions of wild - type Rho ( Fig . 4B ) , Rac ( Fig . 4D ) , or Cdc42 revealed that all three GTPases were recruited along with actin ( Fig . 4 , A and C ) to the IgG - opsonized particles . However , when the experiment was repeated with CR3 - expressing COS cells , only Rho ( Fig . 4F ) , and not Rac ( Fig . 4H ) or Cdc42 , colocalized with F - actin ( Fig . 4 , E and G ) . Thus , Cdc42 is activated after Fc g RII liga - tion , and this results in the activation of a Rac - Rho cascade and the concomitant associa - tion of all three GTPases with the phagosome . In this case , both Cdc42 and Rac , but not Rho , activities are required for particle internaliza - tion . By contrast , CR3 - induced phagocytosis only results in the activation of Rho , and only Rho is recruited to phagosomes surrounding the complement - opsonized particles . The fact that Rho , Rac , and Cdc42 each interact with distinct effector molecules and affect the assembly and organization of filamentous actin in very differ - Fig . 2 ( left ) .

We propose that the Cdc42 / Rac - dependent up - take ( typified by Fc g R ) be termed type I phago - cytosis and the Rho - dependent uptake ( typified by CR3 ) be termed type II . The recruitment of Rho , Rac , and Cdc42 in type I ( but only Rho in type II ) phagocytosis suggests a molecular ex - planation not only for the well - known morpho - logical differences observed between Fc g R - and CR3 - mediated phagocytosis but , more im - portant , for the different associated biological responses ( 2 – 6 ) . Because Rac is an essential regulatory component of the NADPH oxidase enzyme complex and because both Rac and Cdc42 activate the JNK and p38 MAPK path - ways , the reason why type I , but not type II , mediated phagocytosis is accompanied by an inflammatory response could be explained ( 11 , 21 ) . Finally , type II phagocytosis provides a possible explanation for the lack of an inflam - matory response associated with the uptake of apoptotic cells and with the invasion of macro - phages by pathogenic microorganisms such as Leishmania major and Mycobacterium leprae ( 22 ) .

Under these conditions , C3b is rapidly (cid:222)xed to IgM - coated RBCs and is com - pletely converted into C3bi [ S . L . Newman and L . K . Mikus , J . Exp . Med . 161 , 1414 ( 1985 ) ] . Opsonization was checked by (cid:223)uorescence after incubation with FITC - conjugated anti - rabbit IgG or with goat anti - C3 ( Sigma ) followed by FITC - conjugated anti - goat IgG . All IgG - RBCs and C3bi - RBCs appeared to be uniform - ly labeled .

For phagocytosis assays , comple - ment - opsonized RBCs were allowed to interact for 20 min at 37¡C with transfected COS cells . IgG - opsonized RBCs were allowed to adhere to cells for 15 min at 4¡C , then unbound RBCs were washed off and phagocytes were further incubated for 15 min at 37¡C in Hepes - buffered DMEM . After (cid:222)xation and immuno(cid:223)uores - cence , transfected COS cells were scored for their abil - ity to bind or phagocytose RBCs ( 14 ) . COS cells were examined for phagocytic receptor ( control ) or Myc ex - pression ( cotransfection with Myc - tagged constructs ) , and only the positive cells were analyzed for RBC bind - ing or phagocytosis . Positive cells represented ; 20 % of the total number of COS cells per cover slip , that is , $ 100 cells per cover slip . Rhodamine - conjugated don - key anti - rabbit IgGs were used to detect RBCs . An attachment was de(cid:222)ned by the ability of injected or transfected cells to bind one or more RBCs . Phagocyto - sis was de(cid:222)ned by the ability of transfected cells to internalize one or more RBCs .

Proteolysis commences during anaphase , persisting throughout G 1 until it is terminated by cyclin - dependent kinases ( CDKs ) as cells enter S phase . Proteolysis of mitotic cyclins in yeast was shown to require association of the APC with the substrate - speci(cid:222)c activator Hct1 ( also called Cdh1 ) . Phosphorylation of Hct1 by CDKs blocked the Hct1 - APC interaction . The mutual inhibition between APC and CDKs explains how cells suppress mitotic CDK activity during G 1 and then establish a period with elevated kinase activity from S phase until anaphase . Entry into anaphase and exit from mitosis are promoted by APC - dependent proteolysis of regulatory proteins ( 1 ) . Sister chromatid sepa - ration requires Pds1 degradation shortly before anaphase onset , whereas Cdk1 inactivation dur - ing late anaphase involves proteolysis of mitot - ic cyclins such as Clb2 . How activity of the APC toward different substrates is regulated during the cell cycle is unclear . The APC itself might be regulated , because the cyclin ubiquiti - nation activity associated with purified APC fluctuates during the cell cycle ( 2 , 3 ) . APC - dependent proteolysis requires two related pro - teins containing Trp - Asp repeats which func - tion as substrate - specific activators . Cdc20 pro - motes degradation of “early” substrates such as Pds1 and Hct1 promotes degradation of “late” substrates such as Clb2 ( 4 – 6 ) . In yeast , there is an inverse correlation between Cdk1 activity and degradation of mitotic cyclins ( 7 ) . Ectopic inhibition of Cdk1 induces precocious cyclin degradation , suggesting a role for Cdk1 in the inhibition of cyclin proteolysis from S phase until anaphase ( 8 ) . However , the relevant Cdk1 substrate has not been identified . To test whether Hct1 is needed for cyclin ubiquitination , we incubated extracts from G 1 - arrested wild - type and hct1 mutant cells with Clb2 and Clb3 ( 9 ) . Wild - type extracts support - ed destruction box – dependent cyclin ubiquiti - nation , whereas hct1 mutant extracts were as defective in this reaction as extracts from a cdc16 - 123 mutant that contains a defective APC subunit ( Fig . 1 ) . Thus , Hct1 was required for APC - mediated cyclin ubiquitination . To test whether Hct1 associated with the APC , we constructed CDC16 - HA3 strains containing Hct1 variants with Myc epitopes at the NH 2 - terminus ( Myc9 - Hct1 ) or the COOH - terminus ( Hct1 - Myc9 ) ( 10 ) . HCT1 - myc9 strains were defective in the degrada - tion of Clb2 and Clb3 , whereas Myc9 - Hct1 was fully functional . Cdc16 - HA3 coprecipi - tated with Myc9 - Hct1 but not with Hct1 - Myc9 in extracts prepared from cycling or G 1 - arrested cells ( Fig . 2A ) ( 11 ) . Another APC subunit , Cdc23 - HA3 , also coprecipi - tated with Myc9 - Hct1 but not with Hct1 - Myc9 ( 12 ) . The correlation between Hct1 function and coprecipitation with APC sub - units suggests that cyclin ubiquitination de - pends on an Hct1 - APC interaction . Myc9 - Hct1 was not associated with Cdc16 - HA3 in extracts from cells arrested in S phase by hydroxyurea or in M phase by nocodazole ( Fig . 2A ) . Cdc20 , in contrast , was associated with APC subunits in both extracts ( Fig . 2B ) . To test whether the Hct1 - APC interaction was regulated during an unperturbed cell cycle , we measured the association between Myc18 - Hct1 and Cdc16 - HA3 in cells synchronized by cen - trifugal elutriation ( Fig . 2C ) ( 13 ) . Hct1 was associated with Cdc16 during G 1 but not during the S , G 2 , and M phases ( 14 ) . Dissociation of Hct1 from the APC correlated with appearance of the S phase promoting Clb5 - Cdk1 activity . Thus , the Hct1 - APC interaction was cell cycle – regulated .
