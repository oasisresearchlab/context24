Although intracellular stress dynamics ( ISD ) , which are closely related to the regulation of cell functions such as proliferation and differentiation , can be characteristically modulated in cells migrating on a matrix with stiffness - heterogeneity , it has been unclear how the mode of fluctuation of ISD affects cell functions . In the present study , we demonstrate that mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs ) dual - durotaxing ( i . e . , both forward and reverse durotaxis ) on microelastically - patterned gels with stiff triangular domains markedly amplify the fluctuation of ISD , nuclear shape , and the spatial distribution of chromatins , which makes the cells remain far from tensional equilibrium . We provide evidence that amplified chromatin fluctuation in the dual - durotaxing MSCs can cause activation of cellular vigor and maintenance of the stemness . .

Some types of cells migrate on a matrix with cell - scale stiffness - heterogeneity , such as is typically seen in the process of wound healing in disordered tissues 4 , 5 , biological development in immature growing tissues 6 - 8 , and long - distance stem cell migration 9 - 11 . Migrating cells dynamically remodel the adhesion machinery and cytoskeletal architecture through interaction with the mechanical milieu 12 , 13 , and thus exhibit continuous deformation in cell shape and spatiotemporal fluctuation in intracellular prestress 14 . The cell shape has been revealed to modulate cell functions such as proliferation and differentiation by altering the intracellular prestress 15 , 16 generated by mechanotransductive linkages between the ECM , focal adhesions , cytoskeletons , and the cell nucleus 17 . Such a mechanical network influences chromatin behavior and finally regulates gene expression 18 - 21 . For example , specific positioning of chromatins and intermingling of different chromatin territories play a crucial role in cell - shape - dependent gene expression 22 . Dynamic cell - shaping during cell migration should induce , in principle , characteristic intracellular stress dynamics ( ISD ) and the resulting modulation in cell functions . How does ISD behave on a matrix with stiffness - heterogeneity ? We previously clarified that the fluctuation of ISD in a single moving cell is markedly amplified on the matrix over a time scale of hours 23 . In such a model system of a heterogeneous mechanical milieu in vivo , how does the amplified fluctuation of ISD affect cell functions ? In this study , to reveal the nature of functional regulation in migrating cells , we demonstrate the essential role played by the amplified fluctuation of ISD and nuclear deformation in the functional activation of migrating mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs ) . Our strategy was to make the cells nomadically migrate among different regions of stiffness by alternatively driving both forward and reverse durotaxis over stiff triangular domains 22 ( Fig . 1a ) . In general , adherent cells durotax and accumulate in the stiff region of a matrix 24 , 25 . In this sense , durotaxis is a transient phenomenon before migrating cells eventually settle into tensional equilibrium . However , if we introduce cues for both forward and reverse durotaxis 26 to the . CC - BY - NC - ND 4 . 0 International license perpetuity .

This kind of combined - taxis - inducing system , which exists as mixotaxis in vivo 27 , can be a valuable model for investigating dynamic cell behaviors in ECM with mechanical heterogeneity . For instance , bone - marrow - derived MSCs have been reported to delocalize in a mechanically heterogeneous matrix 28 composed of trabecula ( osteoid ; 25 - 40 kPa 29 , precalcified bone ; ~ 100 kPa 30 ) , sinusoid ( vessel ; 2 - 10 kPa 31 , 32 ) , and cellular interstitium ( ~ 0 . 3 kPa 33 ) . By using a microelastically - patterned matrix that can induce the perfect nomadic migration of MSCs , we provide evidence that the amplified fluctuation of ISD and nuclear deformation in dual - durotaxing MSCs causes the functional activation of various genes related to cellular vigor as well as the maintenance of stemness . Dual - durotaxing - induced amplification of fluctuation of ISD The design principle for microelastically - patterned hydrogels to induce dual - durotaxis is to introduce stiff triangular regions , the size of which is comparable to single cells and the corners of which have a curved elasticity boundary that is convex toward the soft region ( Fig . 1b ) . We previously clarified that reverse durotaxis from the stiff to the soft region could be induced specifically at the convex boundary with a radius of curvature smaller than 50 µ m , while usual forward durotaxis occurs at the side of the triangular domain 26 . First , long - term ISD behaviors ( ~ 24hrs ) of dual - durotaxing cells were analyzed using this sophisticated platform . Stiff triangular domains ( elastic modulus : 20 – 40 kPa ) were patterned on the soft base matrix ( 2 – 4 kPa ) by photolithographic patterning using photo - crosslinkable gelatins 23 , 34 - 37 ( Fig . 1c and d ) . The surface topography of the matrix was carefully set to be smooth by intentionally using out - of - focus irradiation , as seen in the fuzzy phase contrast photograph in Fig . 1c . The height difference in the elasticity boundary region was below 20 µ m and was prepared so that natural cell movement was not hindered ( Fig . 1e ) . The triangle ' s side length ( ca . 150 µ m ) and apex distance ( ca . 120 µ m ) were optimized to balance the residence time between the stiff and soft regions . The observed trajectories of each cell confirmed that the cells migrate in and out of stiff and soft regions ( Fig . 1f , SI Movie 1 ) . Individual cells exhibited perfect nomadic migration .

By using finite element method - based traction force microscopy on a matrix with stiffness - heterogeneity 23 , we measured the magnitude of fluctuation of contractile force CF as the normalized standard deviation of the long - term contractile force dynamics ( ~ 24 hrs . ) ( Fig . 1i and SI Movies 2 - 4 ) . A significant increase in the magnitude of fluctuation and the rate of change of the normalized contractile force dynamics on the patterned ( Pt ) gels evidenced that the fluctuation of ISD was markedly amplified in dual - durotaxing cells compared with cells randomly crawling on the control plain stiff ( St : 20 – 40 kPa ) and soft ( So : 2 – 4 kPa ) gels ( Fig . 1j , k , and Fig . S1a ) as was the fluctuation of cell shape ( Fig . S1b and c ) , suggesting that the dual - durotaxing cells are forced to remain far from tensional equilibrium . Amplified fluctuation of nuclear shape and spatial distribution of chromatin in dual - durotaxing MSCs ISD are mainly derived from the structural dynamics of the cytoskeletal network that is linked to the cell nucleus through the Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton ( LINC ) complex 18 , 38 on the nuclear membrane . The amplified fluctuation of ISD in dual - durotaxing MSCs should transmit enhanced mechanical stimuli from the cytoskeleton to the nucleus . To confirm this effect , we characterized the fluctuation of the shape of the cell nucleus by measuring the dynamics of the aspect ratio through live - cell imaging over 12 hrs ( Fig . 2a , SI Movies 5 , 6 , Fig . S2 ) . The magnitude of fluctuation of the aspect ratio was defined as the standard deviation of the ratio in the time - course data , which was normalized with the means of both the fluctuation and correlation time of the autocorrelation function . On Pt gels , the magnitude of fluctuation and the deformation rate of the nuclear shape were significantly larger than those on the control culture plate ( CP ) ( Fig . 2b and c , respectively ; the comparison of St and So is described in Fig . S2 ) . This amplified nuclear fluctuation in dual - durotaxing MSCs on Pt gels was diminished by the tension inhibitors Y27632 , blebbistatin , and cytochalasin D , as seen in the reduced deformation rate of the nuclear aspect ratio ( Fig . 2d ) , which constituted evidence that tensional fluctuation in the actomyosin cytoskeletal network plays a critical role in force transmission to .

How does the amplified fluctuation in nuclear shaping affect the dynamic behavior of chromatins ? Next , we analyzed the spatiotemporal fluctuation of fluorescently labeled chromatins through live imaging over 5 . 5 hrs for single nuclei in dual - durotactic cells ( Fig . 2e and g , SI Movie 7 ) on Pt gels and usual crawling cells on CP ( Fig . 2f and h , SI Movie 8 ) . The magnitude of fluctuation of the spatial distribution of chromatins was markedly enhanced on Pt ( Fig . 2i ) . These results are evidence that dual - durotaxing MSCs with amplified fluctuation of ISD have jittered chromatins inside the greatly fluctuating nucleus . Stemness of dual - durotaxing MSCs and nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of YAP How is the stemness affected in MSCs for which ISD and nuclear shaping are amplified during dual - durotactic migration ? There was no change in any of the MSC markers ( positive markers : CD73 , CD105 , CD90 , and negative markers : CD11b , CD14 , CD19 , CD34 , CD45 , HLA - DR ) between before and after dual - durotactic culture ( Fig . 3a and b ) . The differentiation potential of MSCs that had been subjected to 1 week of mechanical stimulation from CP , St , So , and Pt gels was characterized directly on each sample ( i . e . , in situ differentiation induction ; see scheme in Fig . 3c - ( I ) ) and on CP after reseeding from the gel samples ( i . e . , post - Pt standard differentiation induction ; see scheme in Fig . 3c - ( II ) ) . As for osteogenic in situ induction ( Fig . 3d - ( I ) ) , dual - durotactic MSCs showed suppressed differentiation ( Fig . 3f - ( I ) ) at a level similar to that of cells on So gels , suggesting that the cells either could resist the differentiation bias toward osteogenic lineages or had lost their differentiation potential . To explore these possibilities , standard induction on CP after Pt culture was performed ( Fig . 3d - ( II ) ) . Osteogenic differentiation was fully recovered on Pt gels compared with on CP ( Fig . 3f - ( II ) ) , which confirmed that dual - durotaxing MSCs retained their stemness and osteogenic differentiation potential . In addition , there was no accumulation of mechanical dose that would make cells biased for osteogenic lineage and deteriorate their stemness . On the other hand , adipogenic in situ induction for dual - durotaxing MSCs exhibited highly efficient differentiation compared with the control CP ( Fig . 3e - ( I ) and g - ( I ) ) . After culture on Pt gels , the reseeded cells showed that they had maintained a highly efficient adipogenic differentiation in post - Pt standard induction ( Fig . 3e - .

These results confirmed that dual - durotaxing MSCs maintained their stemness , which significantly suppresses the bias toward an osteogenic lineage . To address the mechanism of this in situ suppression of an osteogenic bias , we characterized the intracellular localization of YAP and RUNX2 ( Fig . S3 ) . These were mainly localized in the cell nucleus and cytoplasm on plain St and So gels , respectively . However , on Pt gels they were delocalized inside and outside the nucleus between stiff and soft regions . The distribution measured from the fluorescence ratio indicated the typical trend for stiffness - dependent localization of YAP and RUNX2 on homogeneous gels and delocalization on Pt gels ( Fig . S3 ) . This observation carries a corollary that the accumulation of mechanical dose toward an osteogenic lineage should be inhibited through the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of mechanotransducer during nomadic migration between regions of different stiffness . Under these conditions , the specific differentiation - related signaling pathway should always be perturbed due to the short - term switching based on different levels of mechanical stimuli ; thus , no pathway could lead to a specific lineage . Live - cell imaging showed YAP shuttling , which occurred with a time lag of about 30 min after the cell crossed the elastic boundary ( SI Movie 9 ) . Indeed , the nomadic migration of MSCs among regions of different stiffness made stiffness - dependent mechanotransducer move nomadically inside cells and contributed to the failure to accumulate the signals required for lineage specification , which we previously referred to as “frustrated differentiation” 39 , 40 . Enhanced gene expression and cytokine production in dual - durotaxing MSCs with amplified nuclear fluctuation What impact does the amplified fluctuation of chromatins have on the modulation of gene expression and function in dual - durotaxing MSCs with maintained stemness ? After four days of culture , a comprehensive gene expression analysis was performed for MSCs on Pt gels and the control substrates ( St , So , CP ) . The numbers of genes that were up - regulated ( > 1 . 5 - fold ) and down - regulated ( < 0 . 67 - fold ) relative to those in cells on CP are shown in Fig . S4 . There were 193 and 262 Pt - specific up - regulated and down - regulated genes , respectively . Pt - , St - , and So - specifically regulated genes are listed in Tables S1 - S3 .

S5 . While signaling related to IL - 8 , ILK , FGF , PDGF , HGF , Netrin , Mouse ESC pluripotency , and so on , was shown to have high positive Z - scores above 2 . 0 , only a few pathways showed repressed signaling with high negative Z - scores ( Insulin secretion and FGF signaling ) . Interestingly , a comparison with canonical pathway analysis revealed that only Pt - culture was associated with various signaling activation with statistical cut - off criteria of - Log P > 1 . 3 and Z - score > 2 . 0 . No such predominant response was observed in St - or So - cultures . The locations of the regulated genes in each pathway are shown in Fig . S6 . Another IPA biofunction analysis , which evaluates the degree of significance in knowledge - database - based prediction for functional activation or inactivation in cell function , also suggested a clear tendency for the activation of various functional categories only for the dual - durotaxing cells ( Fig . 4a , Fig . S7 ) . Based on these results , a comparison between Pt - , St - , and So - culture with cut - off criteria of - log P > 1 . 3 and Z score > 2 . 0 in physiological functional categories showed very clearly that the substantial inactivation of morbidity or mortality , organismal death , apoptosis , and necrosis was predicted only on Pt . In contrast , the significant activation of vigor - related functional categories , including cell survival , cell viability , cell movement , and cell migration , was predicted , along with the activation of other various cellular functions ( Fig . 4b ) . The groups of genes associated with these predictions are summarized in Fig . S8 . Is the Pt - induced regulation of gene expression homogenous in the entire cell population , or does it result from a specific cell population ? Since cultured MSCs are typically heterogeneous ensembles , the differential gene expressions observed above cannot necessarily discriminate whether such regulation is derived from the majority of the cell population or from a limited subset of cells . Therefore , we next performed single - cell quantitative PCR to characterize the properties of MSCs that experienced Pt - culture ( 46 cells ) in comparison to those in the usual CP - culture ( 46 cells ) ( Fig . 5a ) . Forty - eight assays were performed , including for a set of target genes found in the microarray data ( APC , DUSP6 , ADGRG1 , etc . ) , genes involved in the stemness of MSCs ( OCT4 , MEFLIN , etc . ) , and genes of molecules involved in the therapeutic efficacy of MSCs ( CXCR4 , IDO1 , TSG6 , IL6 , BDNF , etc . ) ( Table S4 ) .

These clusters were divided in the hierarchical analysis ( Fig . 5a ) , tSNE plot , and violin plot ( Fig . S9 ) , indicating that the Pt - culture cells were clearly in different populations than those in the CP culture . bFGF , NGF , and BDNF were primarily up - regulated by qPCR even with an RNA sample of cell ensembles ( Fig . S10a ) . Gene expression profiles were almost homogeneous in the Pt - cultured cell clusters ; thus , the Pt - induced activation of cell functions applied to the whole cell population . To evaluate the impacts on therapeutic function , we characterized the secretion of cytokines from dual - durotaxing MSCs . The production of 11 immunomodulatory cytokines involved in the therapeutic efficacy of MSCs ( IL - 2 , IL - 4 , IL - 6 , IL - 8 , IL - 10 , TNF , IFN - γ , RANTES , MIG , MCP - 1 , IP - 10 ) was measured ( Fig . 5b , Fig . S10b ) . Specifically , in Pt - cultured MSCs , IP - 10 , TNF - a , IL - 4 , and MIG production was significantly increased by 4 . 67 - , 3 . 39 - , 3 . 26 - , and 3 . 15 - fold compared to those in the CP - culture cells , respectively , confirming the possibility of an enhanced therapeutic benefit . The functional activation of dual - durotaxing MSCs was predicted for gene expression and some protein production related to the therapeutic effects . Dual - durotaxing - induced nuclear activation is caused by the mechanical linkage between the cytoskeleton and the cell nucleus . What mechanistic factors are involved in the above - characterized nuclear activation in dual - durotaxing cells ? APC ( adenomatous polyposis coli ) was used as a marker for dual - durotaxing - induced nuclear activation in the inhibition experiments to assess the degree of such an activation response . It was the most up - regulated gene during Pt - culture found in the microarray measurement . Depletion of actomyosin tension decreased APC expression ( Fig . S11a ) , suggesting that cytoskeletal force transmission is critical for nuclear activation . Inhibition of LINC complex was performed for LaminA / C of the inner nuclear membrane cortical structure and SUN1 ( Sad1 - UNP84 ) with each siRNA . Knockdown of Lamin A / C negated APC up - regulation on Pt gels , suggesting that linkage between the nuclear scaffold and chromatins is essential for transmitting the amplified ISD fluctuation inside the cell nucleus and the resulting .

S11b ) . Interestingly , knockdown of SUN1 , which connects the actin cytoskeleton and nuclear scaffold 41 , did not significantly affect the up - regulation of APC on Pt gels but did reduce APC expression on CP ( Fig . S11b ) , which suggests that the amplified nuclear deformation may not simply be actomyosin - derived , but rather could result from the integrated dynamic contribution of a cytoskeletal cage fluctuating the nucleus . How does the amplification of nuclear deformation modulate the expression of many genes involved in the activation of vigorous function of the cells ? Chromatins directly bound to Lamin A / C in nuclear lamina that connects to SUN1 in the LINC complex should be subjected to the enhanced fluctuation of nuclear strain and stress , which may cause Pt - induced gene activation . The stress fluctuation in the nuclear membrane caused by the amplified fluctuation of ISD can propagate from the outer region toward the central region of the nucleus through interchromatin mingling , i . e . , amplified fluctuation of ISD should enhance intranuclear stress fluctuation depending on a characteristic spatiotemporal distribution of chromatins . It has been revealed that the prestressed state of chromatin can affect cellular functions 42 , 43 , for example , through the structural modulations in the stress concentration site inside the nucleus , such as the intermingling region of chromatin territory 22 . In our system , cell shape was not confined to a particular micropattern and varied dynamically ; therefore , it is natural to speculate that the dynamic cell - shape fluctuations exert extensive structural modulations of chromatins , which may affect the higher - ordered structure of stress concentration sites in various intranuclear hierarchical structures of chromatins such as the intermingling region between different chromosome territories , topologically - associated domains , and chromosome band boundaries . Nomadic cell migration among different regions of stiffness may interfere with the heterogeneous intranuclear mechanical structures and affect the regulation of gene expression at the structural boundaries with stress concentrations . In summary , dual - durotaxing nomadic MSCs on a matrix with cell - scale stiffness - heterogeneity were found to have amplified long - term fluctuations in ISD , nuclear shaping , and spatiotemporal chromatin dynamics ( schematically summarized in Fig . 6 ) , which can lead to both the suppression of lineage bias to maintain stemness and the activation of vigorous cell .

This cellular response was confirmed based on force transmission from the stiffness - heterogeneous matrix to the chromatin through the mechanical linkage between CSK and the nucleus . Significantly , therapeutic trophic effects that MSCs have as one of the most clinically useful stem cells 44 , such as anti - inflammatory , immunomodulatory , and tissue - protection effects , are typically attenuated by passage history involving lineage bias 45 . In this sense , matrix - mechanics - dependent lineage bias of MSCs is undesirable for maintaining its therapeutic properties due to the memory of mechanical stimulation from the culture environment 46 , the accumulation of associated mRNAs 47 , and the epigenetic history 48 . Since lineage specification results from lineage - specific tensional equilibrium as a local stable state as depicted in Waddington ' s landscape 49 , avoiding tensional equilibrium with the amplified fluctuation of ISD should inhibit the lineage bias and assure the therapeutic quality of MSCs . A cell manipulation strategy for avoiding long - term tensional equilibrium in self - migrating stem cells was revealed to contribute to the refinement of stemness and functional activation .

Human bone marrow - derived MSCs ( PT - 2501 , Lonza , Basel , Switzerland ) were seeded at a density of 5 . 0 × 10 3 cells / cm 2 and expanded in mesenchymal stem cell growth medium ( MSCGM ™ BulletKit ™ , Lonza ) on a tissue culture polystyrene dish ( CP ) ( TPP Techno Plastic Products AG , Trasadingen , Switzerland ) at 37℃ in a humidified atmosphere with 5 % CO 2 . Culture medium was replaced every 3 - 4 days . Dulbecco ' s Modified Eagle Medium （ DMEM , low glucose , FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Corp . , Osaka , Japan ） was basically used in all the experiments for the observation of migration and functional characterizations . MSCs at passages 4 - 6 were used for all experiments . Preparation of microelastically - patterned gelatinous gels . The microelastically - patterned gels were photolithographically prepared with photocurable styrenated gelatin ( StG ) 1 , 2 . Briefly , StG ( 30 wt . % ) and sulfonyl camphorquinone ( 2 . 0 – 3 . 0 wt . % of gelatin ; Toronto Research Chemicals , ON , Canada ) were dissolved in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) , conditioned using an AR - 100 deforming agitator ( THINKY Corp . , Tokyo , Japan ) . The StG sol solution was sandwiched and spread between vinyl - silanized glass substrates ( vinyl - glass ) and a normal glass substrate coated with poly ( N - isopropylacrylamide ) ( PNIPAAm , Sigma Aldrich , St . Louis , MO , USA ) . Volumes of the spread sol solution were 30 and 90 µ l for the vinyl - glass with diameters of 18 mm and 32 mm , respectively . As the first step , a soft base gel was prepared by irradiation of the entire sandwiched sol solution with visible light for 120s – 210s ( 45 – 50 mW / cm 2 at 488 nm ; light source : MME - 250 ; Moritex Saitama , Japan ) . Next , stiff regions were prepared by irradiation of the base gel with equilateral - triangular irradiation patterns ( side lengths : 150 µ m , intercorner distances : 120 µ m ) by a custom - built , mask - free , reduction - projection - type photolithographic system using an EB - 1770W liquid crystal display projector ( Seiko Epson Corp . , Nagano , Japan ) . To make the triangular irradiation patterns on large gels ( 32 mm diameter ) , we also used a photomask on an LED panel light ( 5 . 2 mW / cm 2 at 488 nm ; light source : LMG150x180NW ; Aitec System Co . , Ltd . , Yokohama , Japan ) . Throughout these processes , the temperature of the StG sol and base gel was carefully kept above the LCST of PNIPAAm using a hot plate ( Kitazato Corp . , Fuji , Japan ) so that the PNIPAAm polymers did not dissolve and intermingle with the top surface of patterned hydrogels . In addition , all these processes were performed in N 2 chambers . Finally , the gels were detached from the sacrificial PNIPAAm - coated normal glass under room temperature and washed thoroughly with PBS at 28 °C over 12 hrs to completely remove adsorbed PNIPAAm . As we reported previously , the surface biochemical conditions were ensured to be the same for all the gel samples with . CC - BY - NC - ND 4 . 0 International license perpetuity .

Therefore , the present experiments enabled us to investigate the pure biomechanical aspects of cell migration . Measurement of elasticity and topography of the gels . The surface elasticity of the StG gel was determined by nano - indentation analysis using an atomic force microscope ( JPK NanoWizard 4 , JPK Instruments , Bruker Nano GmbH , Germany ) . A commercial silicone - nitride cantilever with a nominal spring constant of 0 . 03 - 0 . 09 N / m was used ( qp - BioAC - CI CB3 , Nanosensors™ , Neuchatel , Switzerland ) . Young’s moduli of the surface were evaluated from force - indentation curves by nonlinear least - squares fitting to the Hertz model in the case of a parabolic indenter ( tip radius of curvature 30 nm ; Poisson ratio : 0 . 45 ) . To create a spatial distribution of elasticity of the triangular pattern gel , we measured tens of tiles with a 50 x 50 µ m elasticity map and a distance of 2 . 5 µ m between measured points . Next , we reconstructed the spatial distribution of elasticity from the tiles . The topographic condition of the sample surface was also measured by using the atomic force microscope . Although the soft regions were higher than the stiff regions , the connection between the two regions was smooth enough to not disturb natural durotaxis . Previously , we reported that a height difference of less than several tens of microns did not affect the ability to induce durotaxis as long as the topographic connection in the elasticity boundary was appropriately smooth 2 , 3 . Pre - conditioning of StG gels for cell culture . The prepared StG gels were sterilized and equilibrated with a culture medium prior to all the experiments as follows . ( 1 ) The untreated StG gels were soaked in 70 % aqueous ethanol solution and washed 100 times with paddling . ( 2 ) The gels were transferred to 0 . 2 µm filter - sterilized PBS and washed 100 times with paddling to remove ethanol . ( 3 ) The gels were transferred to new sterile PBS and stored in a 37°C incubator so as to be fully swollen until just before use . ( 4 ) The PBS was replaced with DMEM with 10 % FBS , and the gels were fully equilibrated for 3hrs in DMEM at 37 ℃ under a 5 % CO 2 atmosphere in an incubator , and were finally ready for use . Time - lapse observation of cell migration and analysis of cell trajectories . The migration of cells on the patterned gel was observed using an automated all - in - one microscope with a temperature - and humidity - controlled cell chamber ( BZ - X700 ; Keyence Corp . , Osaka , Japan ) . Prior to the time - lapse observations , cells were seeded onto the gel at a density of 1 × 10 3 cells / cm 2 and cultured in DMEM containing 10 % FBS for 18 – 22 hours under 5 % CO 2 . Phase - contrast images of cells were captured every 15 min for 24 h . For each experiment , we collected phase - contrast images from 11 positions of 2 gel samples . To eliminate the effect of cell - cell . CC - BY - NC - ND 4 . 0 International license perpetuity .

Movement trajectories of the cells were analyzed using MATLAB software ( MathWorks , MA , USA ) . Based on the edge - detection of a cell , we extracted the shape of the cell from phase - contrast images . The details of image processing have been explained previously 4 . We traced each cell and measured the time evolution of its trajectory . If the cells collided with each other or if a cell divided , we stopped the trace . When the cells separated again , we renumbered the cells and restarted the trace . Traction force microscopy . Traction force microscopy on a field of heterogeneous stiffness was performed according to the method that we previously reported 3 . Briefly , we first made gels with embedded beads . To embed the fluorescent beads near the patterned surface of the gels , a sacrificial glass was coated with the following ordered layers by using a spin coater : PNIPAAm , StG sol , and StG sol with fluorescent beads ( Fluorospheres Carboxylate - Modified Microspheres , 0 . 2 µ m , red fluorescent ( 580 / 605 ) , Invitrogen , MA , USA ) . We added 0 . 1 wt . % Tween 20 to coat the StG sol solution to improve wettability . Next , we spread 25 µ L of the StG sol solution between the vinyl - glass and the sacrificial PNIPAAm - coated glass . The procedure for photoirradiation was identical to that for gels without beads . The images of the cells and fluorescent beads were monitored using an automated all - in - one microscope with a temperature - and humidity - controlled cell chamber ( BZ - X700 ; Keyence ) . Phase - contrast images of the cells and fluorescent images of the beads were captured every 15 min for 24 h . After the time - lapse , we detached the cells by adding DMEM containing 0 . 3 % Tween 20 . We then measured the reference image of the fluorescent beads . To calculate the traction force of the cells , we used finite - element - method ( FEM ) - based traction force microscopy . By comparing images with and without cells , the displacement of the beads was calculated using commercial PIV software ( Flownizer 2D ; Detect Corp . , Tokyo , Japan ) . In the calculation of FEM , a hexahedron was used for discretization ( the size of the unit is about 8 x 8 x 6 µ m ) . The nodes of a hexahedron at the substrate surface were chosen to be identical to the nodes of PIV . We assumed that the patterned gel is a linear elastic body with spatial modulation according to Young’s modulus E ( x ) : ( 1 ) where i , j , and k are x , y , and z , respectively . s ij and u ij are the stress tensor and strain tensor , respectively . d ij is the Kronecker delta . Poisson ratio n was set to be 0 . 45 . For homogeneous gels , E ( x ) is constant . For patterned gels , we assumed ( ) , 1 1 2 ij ij kk ij E x u u n s d n n æ ö = + ç ÷ + - è ø .

E 0 , A kx , ky , and B kx , ky are mean elasticity and Fourier coefficients , respectively . With FEM , the equilibrium equation for a linear elastic body Eq . ( 1 ) was discretized . Next , we numerically calculated displacement M ijkl due to a unit force , where M ijkl is the k component of the displacement at node i when a unit force is applied in the l direction at node j . The displacement vector of the gel U induced by the traction force vector F is described as ( 3 ) where matrix M is composed of M ijkl . F is reconstructed by minimizing a target function S , which is a combination of the least - square displacement error and a weighted norm of the forces : ( 4 ) where U r and A are displacements of the substrate measured experimentally and the local penalty matrix , respectively . The minimum of S , dS / dF = 0 , gives ( 5 ) The local penalty matrix A is defined as follows 5 . ( 6 ) We repeatedly calculated Eqs . ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) until convergence was reached .

The correlation time of CF was calculated by fitting the autocorrelation function of CF by an exponential . To measure the strength of fluctuation , we also calculated the average magnitude of the time - derivative of normalized CF , 〈 - 𝐶𝐹̇ - 〉 / 〈𝐶𝐹〉 , which represents the rate of change of contractile force per unit time . Time - lapse observation of nuclear shaping dynamics and chromatin fluctuation . The MSCs were seeded onto the homogenous stiff ( St : 20 – 40 kPa ) , soft ( So : 2 – 4 kPa ) , patterned ( Pt : stiff region : 20 – 40 kPa , soft region : 2 – 4 kPa ) gels and CP at a density of 1 , 000 cells per cm 2 . After overnight cultivation , the cells were stained with NucBlue ä Live ReadyProbe ä ( Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR , USA ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . After staining , the cells were washed twice with phenol - red - free CO 2 independent Leibovitz’s medium ( L - 15 , Gibco ä , MA , USA ) . At least 3 hr before time - lapse observation , the cells were incubated in L - 15 supplemented with 10 % FBS , penicillin / streptomycin , and 1 mM VectaCell Trolox ä ( Vector Laboratories , CA , USA ) . Fluorescent time - lapse observation of the nuclear dynamics was carried out on a BZ - X700 microscope using a 20X objective lens ( 4 stacking images , 10 μm layer ) . Movies were taken for 24 hr at 10 min intervals . Inhibitor treatment was performed by first culturing the cells on the substrates for 24 hr . The culture media was then replaced with the media containing 25 µ M blebbistatin ( FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Corp . , Osaka , Japan ) , 50 µ M Y27632 ( R & D Systems , MN , USA ) , 25 µ M ML7 ( Sigma Aldrich , MO , USA ) , or 0 . 4 µ M cytochalasin D ( Sigma Aldrich , MO , USA ) . After overnight incubation , the cells were stained with NucBlue ä , and time - lapse observation was performed in the presence of the inhibitors and Trolox . For the observation of chromatin fluctuation , time - lapse analysis was performed with similar procedures as nuclear shaping dynamics except that the fluorescent intensity of the nuclei was observed using a 20X objective lens with 2X optical zoom for 12 hr at 10 - min intervals . Analysis of nuclear shaping dynamics . The shaping dynamics of the cell nuclei were analyzed using MATLAB software . First , we adopted a Gaussian filter with a cut - off frequency of 0 . 13 µ m - 1 for the fluorescent image of the nuclei . Next , we adopted a top - hat filter to eliminate the background . The filtered images were binarized with the threshold determined based on the maximum intensity of an image . We traced each nucleus and measured the time evolution of the trajectory and shape . If the nuclei collided or if a nucleus replicated , we stopped the trace . When the nuclei separated again , we renumbered the nuclei and restarted the trace . We only analyzed data that accumulated for longer than 12 hr . From binarized images , we calculated the aspect ratio of the nuclei . The binarized nuclei were fitted by the ellipsoid through the function CF ln 2 / f t k = ( ) exp t k - D . CC - BY - NC - ND 4 . 0 International license perpetuity .

Next , we analyzed the time series of the aspect ratio of the nuclei . By fitting the autocorrelation function of the aspect ratio by an exponential , the correlation time t f = ln2 / k was determined . Similar to the analysis of contractile force , the normalized standard deviation divided by correlation time , 𝜎 ( 𝐴𝑠 ) / 𝜏 ’ 〈𝐴𝑠〉 , was defined as the magnitude of the fluctuation of the nuclear aspect ratio As . Characterization of fluctuation of chromatin distribution . Fluctuation of the chromatin distribution was calculated by an analysis of the fluorescence intensity of the nuclei . Similar to the analysis of nuclear shaping dynamics , we binarized the fluorescent image to determine the interior of the nucleus . We calculated the standard deviation of the fluorescence intensity FI ( x , y ) inside a nucleus at time t , 𝜎 ! " # ( FI ( x , y ) ) , which represented the spatial heterogeneity of the chromatin distribution . Next , we traced the nuclei and measured the time evolution of 𝜎 ! " # ( FI ) . We defined the normalized standard deviation , 𝜎 $ % & " & 𝜎 ! " # ( 𝐹𝐼 ) ’ / 〈𝜎 ! " # ( 𝐹𝐼 ) 〉 $ % & " , as the magnitude of fluctuation of the spatiotemporal distribution of chromatins . Immunofluorescence staining of YAP . hMSCs were seeded onto StG gel at 2500 cells / cm 2 , cultured for 4 days , fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde ( FUJIFILM Wako ) for 15 min , then permeabilized and blocked with PBS containing 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 ( Sigma Aldrich , MO , USA ) , 10 % donkey serum ( EMD Millipore Corp . , CA , USA ) , and 1 % albumin from bovine serum ( FUJIFILM Wako ) for 45 min . The cells were incubated with a primary antibody , 10 μg / ml rabbit anti - YAP ( GTX129151 , Genetex , CA , USA ) at 4°C overnight . The samples were washed with PBS - 0 . 05 % Tween 3 times for 15 min each . Subsequently , the cells were incubated with a secondary antibody ( donkey anti - rabbit conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 ( 1 : 1000 ; Invitrogen ) for 60 min at 37°C . After washing , the fluorescent images were acquired using a BZ - X700 microscope . Quantitative image analysis of YAP localization . To quantify the magnitude of YAP localization , we calculated the ratio of fluorescence intensity between the nucleus and cytosol ( Nuc / Cyt YAP ratio ) from fluorescent images of YAP . The intensity of the nucleus was defined by the mean intensity of the region that satisfied D < 12 µ m , where D represented the distance from the center of the nucleus . As for the intensity of cytosol , we used the mean intensity of the region that satisfied 12 < D < 24 µ m . We defined nuclear localization of YAP for a Nuc / Cyt YAP ratio > 1 . 6 and cytosol localization for a Nuc / Cyt YAP ratio < 1 . 2 , respectively .

Reverse transcription was performed using random hexamers with high - fidelity PrimeScript Reverse Transcriptase ( Takara Bio Inc . , Tokyo , Japan ) . The cDNA of YAP was obtained by RT - PCR with specific primers flanking the coding regions using PrimeStar Ò Max DNA Polymerase ( Takara Bio ) . The expected PCR products were digested from the agarose gel and purified with a GENECLEAN Ò II kit ( MP Biomedical , CA , USA ) . The purified products were phosphorylated by kinasing and blunt - end ligating to the HincII / BAP ends of pUC118 ( Takara Bio ) using a DNA ligation kit ( Mighty Mix , Takara Bio ) , according to the manufacturer’s instructions . The ligation reaction was used for transformation into E . coli DH5 alpha and plated onto LB - ampicillin supplemented with X - gal ( FUJIFILM Wako ) and IPTG ( FUJIFILM Wako ) . The positive clones were selected for plasmid preparation using a QIAGEN plasmid mini preparation kit ( Qiagen , Hilden , Germany ) and sequencing . The pEF1 - Venus was prepared as previously described 6 . Five micrograms of the plasmid were digested with EcoR V ( Roche Diagnostics , Rotkreuz , Switzerland ) and purified by agarose gel electrophoresis . The purified product was dephosphorylated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase ( Roche Diagnostics ) to prevent self - ligation . The pUC118 plasmids harboring YAP were used as the template for PCR amplification . The 7 - alanine amino acids were introduced to serve as a linker to facilitate correct folding of the fusion protein . Primers containing EcoRV restriction site ( underlined ) and nucleotides encoding for 7 alanine ( italics ) were used for PCR amplification ( forward 5’ GC GGA TAT CCA GCT GCT GCT GCA GCT GCT GCA ACC ATG GAT CCC GGG CAG 3’ , reverse 5’ G CGG ATA TCT CTA TAA CCA TGT AAG 3’ ) for cloning in - frame with the C - terminus of pEF1 - Venus .

After overnight transfection , the culture medium was replaced with L - 15 supplemented with 30 μg / ml RNPs . The time - lapse observation was performed using a 20X objective lens of BZ - X700 with 1 . 5X optical zoom ( 4 stacking images , 3 μm layer ) . Movies were taken for 2 days at 15 min intervals . Flow cytometry of CD marker expression . The cells were harvested with Accutase ( Innovative Cell Technologies , Inc . , CA , USA ) from culture on the StG gels , passed through a cell strainer with 70 µ m mesh , washed with FACS buffer ( 0 . 5 % BSA / PBS , 2mM EDTA ) , and collected by centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 min . The collected cells were fluorescently stained with the following mouse anti - human primary antibodies for 30 min on ice : Positive markers ; CD73 ( Miltenyi Biotec , Germany ) , CD90 ( R & D Systems ) , and CD105 ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc . , TX , USA ) . Negative markers ; CD11b ( MilliporeSigma , MA , USA ) , CD19 ( R & D Systems ) , CD34 ( Santa Cruz ) , CD45 ( Abcam plc . , Cambridge , UK ) , and HLA - DR ( Santa Cruz ) . After being washed to remove primary antibodies , the cells were reacted with fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FlTC ) - labeled secondary anti - mouse antibodies for 30 min on ice ( Alexa 488 - anti mouse IgG , Invitrogen ) . The samples were measured with a flow cytometer ( Guava® easyCyte® ) with a termination count of 5000 cells . Differentiation induction of hMSCs on the gel samples . Differentiation of hMSCs on the gel samples was assayed as follows : ( 1 ) hMSCs were seeded on the gels at a density of 2 , 000 cells / cm² . ( 2 ) To make the cells experience the stiffness stimulus from the gels , preculture on the gels was performed for 7 days with DMEM medium changed once during culture . ( 3 ) After the preculture , the medium was replaced with an induction medium for osteogenic or adipogenic differentiation . ( 4 ) To evaluate the maintenance of differentiation ability after culture on the gels , the cells were detached from the gels with trypsin after 7 days of culture , re - seeded onto CP , and then cultured with induction medium for osteogenic or adipogenic differentiation for 2 or 3 weeks . Osteogenic induction medium was prepared by adding dexamethasone ( final . conc : 100 nM ) , 2 - phospho - L - ascorbic acid trisodium salt ( final . conc : 50 µ g / ml ) , b - glycerol phosphate disodium salt pentahydrate ( final . conc : 10 mM ) to a MEM basal media ( FUJIFILM Wako ) including 10 % FBS and 2M L - glutamine .

In brief , the cells after differentiation - induction culture were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde PBS solution for 15 minutes at room temperature , rinsed three times with distilled water , treated with Alizarin Red S solution ( Sigma - Aldrich ) for 10 minutes under shaded light , or with Mix Oil Red O saturated solution ( FUJIFILM Wako ) for 15 minutes at room temperature , and then rinsed three times using distilled water to reduce nonspecific staining . The stained samples were observed in PBS with an all - in - one fluorescence microscope ( BZ - X700 , Keyence ) . Quantitative image - analysis of osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation . The degree of osteogenic differentiation was quantified by analyzing the RGB color of the bright field image of Alizarin red staining . At the early stage of osteogenic differentiation , the samples were stained red . On the other hand , control gels ( cells without osteogenic differentiation medium ) were stained to be violet , while the control CP became almost white . Thus , to quantify the early stage of osteogenic differentiation , we used the spatially averaged value of D I = I r - I b , where I r and I b were the intensity of the red and blue components of the image , respectively . D I became almost 0 for control samples , and D I had a large value for red - stained images . As osteogenic differentiation proceeded , the stained color became darker , which caused a decrease of D I . Therefore , to quantify the late stage of osteogenic differentiation , we used D I’ = 1 - ( I r - I b ) instead . For all the conditions , we divided the samples into 8 ~ 9 sub - regions and calculated D I or D I’ for each sub - region . To eliminate the contribution of the background color , we subtracted D I of the control samples from the data . To quantify the degree of adipogenic differentiation , we calculated the ratio of the cells stained by oil red O . To determine the stained cells , we classified the stained and non - stained areas from the bright field image of oil red O staining . For the machine learning - based classifier , we used a support vector machine ( MATLAB , MathWorks ) . As training data , we used five typical images of stained areas and the background containing non - stained cells for each sample . The software learned the representative distributions of the intensities in RGB space and calculated the separate plane in RGB space that classifies the two groups 7 . After training , stained and non - stained areas of the image were classified by the software . Next , we considered that the cell was differentiated when the stained area was included in the region D < 2 R n , where D and R n represented the distance from the center of the nucleus and the average radius of the nucleus . We then counted the numbers of differentiated cells and calculated the ratio of the numbers of differentiated cells and total cells . For all the conditions , we divided the samples into 8 ~ 9 sub - regions and calculated the ratio of differentiated cells in the sub - regions . DNA microarray and bioinformatic analysis .

Total RNA ( n = 3 , biological replicates ) was isolated from hMSCs cultured on each sample using a miRNeasy Micro Kit ( Qiagen ) . Total RNA quantity was assessed on a NanoDrop 2000 ( ThermoFisher Scientific , Waltham , MA USA ) , and its quality was assessed on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer ( Agilent Technologies , CA USA ) ; 100 ng of total RNA was used to generate biotin - modified amplified RNA ( aRNA ) with the GeneChip 3’IVT PLUS Reagent Kit ( ThermoFisher ) . Reverse transcription of first - strand complementary DNA ( cDNA ) with a T7 promoter sequence was performed with T7 oligo ( dT ) primer . Second - strand cDNA synthesis was used to convert the single - stranded cDNA into a double - stranded DNA template . The reaction used DNA polymerase and RNase H to degrade the RNA and synthesize second - strand cDNA simultaneously . In vitro transcription of biotin - modified aRNA with IVT Labeling Master Mix generated multiple copies of biotin - modified aRNA from the double - stranded cDNA templates . The aRNA was purified and quantified ; after fragmentation , it was hybridized to the GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2 . 0 Array ( ThermoFisher ) . The arrays were stained with phycoerythrin and washed at the GeneChip Fluidics Station 450 ( Affymetrix , CA USA ) . The microarrays were scanned , data were extracted using GeneChip scanner 3000 7G ( Affymetrix ) , and images were analyzed using the Affymetrix GeneChip Command Console Software and digitized using Affymetrix Expression Console . The results from microarray analysis were uploaded into Qiagen Ingenuity® Pathway Analysis ( IPA ) for core analysis with the IPA knowledge base . IPA was performed to obtain the responses in canonical pathways , the candidates of upstream regulators , and the predicted modulation in biofunctions of the tested cells . A comparative analysis was conducted between the cells cultured on Pt , St , and So gels . Single - cell qPCR . The cells cultured on StG gels ( Pt , St , and So ) and CP at a density of 3 , 000 cells per cm 2 for 4 days were trypsinized , counted , and filtered through a 40 µ m cell strainer . The cells were resuspended in complete DMEM culture media to make the final concentration approximately 1 - 2 X 10 5 cells per ml . Single - cell separation was performed using the C1 system ( Fluidigm , CA , USA ) . The cell suspension was mixed with the cell suspension reagent from the C1 Single - Cell Auto Prep Reagent kit ( Fluidigm ) at a ratio of 3 : 2 ( cell suspension 6 µ l + cell suspension reagent 4 µ l ) . Next , 6 µ l of the cell mixture was loaded onto the primed Integrated Fluidic Circuit ( IFC , C1 Single - Cell Auto Prep for Preamp 17 - 25 μ m , Fluidigm ) , and cells were then captured into the IFC according to the manufacturer’s instructions . The forward and reverse gene - specific primers were pooled to a final concentration of 500 nM for 48 target genes .

Serially diluted standards of capture beads were prepared simultaneously . The sample solutions of reacted beads were centrifuged at 200×g for 5min , washed once with a wash buffer , and resuspended in a wash buffer . Finally , the resuspended bead samples were acquired and analyzed with a flow cytometer ( Guava® easyCyte™ , Luminex , TX , USA ) .

Schematic summary of the nuclear activation of MSCs through dual - durotaxing on a matrix with cell - scale stiffness - heterogeneity . When cells migrate on a matrix with cell - scale stiffness - heterogeneity , this should cause competing mixotactic cues on the matrix , e . g . , dual - durotaxis of forward and reverse migration in this study , amplified ISD fluctuation is transferred to the cell nucleus and induces fast deformation of the nucleus and amplified mechanical fluctuation of chromatins . The avoided tensional equilibrium and the amplified chromatin fluctuation contribute to functional activation of the cells , as demonstrated in the present study . .

The most successful live - cell imaging of the moment of nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of YAP in a dual - durotaxing MSC that is crossing the elasticity boundary of a stiff triangle on Pt gel . By 6hr , YAP is mainly localized in cytoplasm inside the stiff triangle pattern though it is usually localized in the nucleus on the plain stiff gel , which is a typical response on Pt gel due to the time - lag effect of YAP translocation when the cell detects the stiff region . YAP translocation into the nucleus requires several hours after the cell enters the stiff region , while translocation into the cytoplasm also needs several hours after the cell feels the soft region . The dual - durotaxing cell moves over the cell - size - scale stiff region about 4hr in the present patterning , therefore the time - lag of YAP translocation emerges . The cytoplasmic localization of YAP in the stiff triangle region is the delayed response of translocation when the cell felt the soft surroundings . Actually , after 6hr , when the cell crosses the elasticity boundary around the corner of the stiff triangle from the stiff to soft region , YAP starts to translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus even though the cell starts to feel the soft region . This is because the cell sensed the stiff region . . CC - BY - NC - ND 4 . 0 International license perpetuity .
