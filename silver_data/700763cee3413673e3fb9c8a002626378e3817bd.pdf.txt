The clinical spectrum of COVID - 19 is extensive , of which critical cases are with rapid disease progression and high mortality . The aim of our study is to summarize the characteristics of different subtypes and explore risk factors of illness severity for early identification and prompt treatment . Methods : In this retrospective study , we collected data of patients confirmed COVID - 19 in Zhejiang Province from 17 January to 12 February 2020 . According to the definition of clinical classification , we divided confirmed cases into four types , and summarize epidemiological and clinical characteristics , laboratory and radiograph findings , treatments , and outcomes , respectively . Moreover , we used univariate and multivariate ordinal logistic regression models to explore risk factors for the severity of illness in patients with COVID - 19 . Results : A total of 788 patients were enrolled in our study , of whom 52 cases ( 6 . 6 % ) were mild type , 658 cases ( 83 . 5 % ) were common type , 61 cases ( 7 . 2 % ) were severe type , and 17 cases ( 2 . 2 % ) were critical type . Multivariate ordinal logistic regression demonstrated increasing odds of the severity of illness in patients with COVID - 19 associated with male ( odds ratio [ OR ] = 1 . 7 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] : 1 . 2 – 2 . 6 P = 0 . 008 ) , fever ( OR = 3 . 6 , 95 % CI : 2 . 1 – 6 . 3 , P < 0 . 001 ) , cough ( OR = 1 . 7 , 95 % CI : 1 . 0 – 2 . 9 , P = 0 . 041 ) , hemoptysis ( OR = 3 . 4 , 95 % CI : 1 . 1 – 10 . 3 , P = 0 . 032 ) , gastrointestinal symptoms ( OR = 1 . 9 , 95 % CI : 1 . 0 – 3 . 5 , P = 0 . 047 ) , hypertension ( OR = 2 . 6 , 95 % CI : 1 . 2 – 5 . 6 , P = 0 . 013 ) . With the increase of age - grading , risk for the severity of illness was gradually higher ( ≤ 18 years [ OR = 1 . 0 ] , 19 – 40 years [ OR = 12 . 7 , 95 % CI : 4 . 5 – 36 . 0 , P < 0 . 001 ] , 41 – 65 years [ OR = 14 . 8 , 95 % CI : 5 . 2 – 42 . 1 , P < 0 . 001 ] , ≥ 66 years [ OR = 56 . 5 , 95 % CI : 17 . 1 – 186 . 5 , P < 0 . 001 ] ) . Conclusions : Clinicians should pay close attention to these features in patients with COVID - 19 including older age , male , fever , cough , hemoptysis , gastrointestinal symptoms and hypertension to identify the severity of illness as early as possible .

Infectious Diseases of Poverty ( 2020 ) 9 : 85 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1186 / s40249 - 020 - 00710 - 6 Background In December , 2019 , a cluster of patients with pneumonia of unknown cause appeared in Wuhan , Hubei Province , China . By 7 January 2020 , China rapidly isolated the novel coronavirus and shared the viral genome sequence to World Health Organization ( WHO ) [ 1 ] . The novel coronavirus was identified as a novel enveloped RNA betacoronavirus and named 2019 novel coronavirus ( later named as severe acute respiratory syndrome cor - onavirus 2 [ SARS - CoV - 2 ] by the International Commit - tee on Taxonomy of Viruses ) , which has a phylogenetic similarity to severe acute respiratory syndrome corona - virus ( SARS - CoV ) , but the contagosity is higher than SARS - CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome cor - onavirus ( MERS - CoV ) [ 2 ] . In order to prevent the epi - demic of this contagion , Chinese government made a decision to temporarily shut down the traffic departing from Wuhan on 23 January 2020 and adopted a series of control measures . WHO declared the spread of SARS - CoV - 2 was listed as a public health emergency of international concern , and subsequently designated the pneumonia infected by SARS - CoV - 2 as coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) [ 3 ] . Until 19 April 2020 , COVID - 19 has swept across 213 countries and regions which reported 2 245 872 con - firmed cases and 152 707 deaths . The largest number of confirmed cases were in the United States , followed by Spain and Italy [ 4 ] . This phenomenon signified fighting with COVID - 19 is not only a matter for China , but an imperative event for global . Nowadays , the majority of studies on COVID - 19 in China are focused on Wuhan , the hardest - hit area , and little is known about the clinical features of COVID - 19 outside of Wuhan [ 5 – 7 ] . The study of Chang et al . [ 8 ] included 13 cases in Beijing and the research of Xu et al . [ 9 ] enrolled 62 cases in Zhejiang , however , due to the small sample size , clinical characteristics might be not comprehensive . Researches with a larger number of con - firmed cases were urgently needed outside of Wuhan . The clinical spectrum of COVID - 19 appears to be wide , comprising mild type without pneumonia , common type with pneumonia , severe type with respiratory distress , and critical type with respiratory failure , shock or even death [ 10 ] . Diverse subtypes have their unique features , whether in epidemiology or laboratory results . A study with 72 314 cases reported by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention ( China CDC ) showed that the case - fatality rate was 49 . 0 % among critical cases [ 11 ] . Therefore , mastering the characteristics of different subtypes and early identification of the severity of illness is of great significance for the treatment . Hence , the aim of our study is to summarize the epi - demiologic and clinical characteristics , laboratory and radiograph findings , treatments , and outcomes of different subtypes of patients with COVID - 19 in Zhe - jiang Province . On this basis , we want to explore risk factors for the severity of illness in patients with COVID - 19 and appeal to clinicians to attach importance to these factors . Methods Data sources and ethics We conducted a retrospective study investigating on the epidemiological , clinical , laboratory , radiograph , treat - ments and outcomes characteristics of confirmed cases of COVID - 19 in Zhejiang Province from 17 January to 12 February 2020 . Diagnosis of COVID - 19 was in ac - cordance with the interim guidance from the WHO [ 12 ] . A confirmed case of COVID - 19 was defined as a positive result on real - time reverse transcriptase poly - merase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) assay of sputum and throat swab specimens . Only laboratory - confirmed pa - tients were enrolled in our study . Data were uniformly collected by the Health Commission of Zhejiang Prov - ince , where all patients were allocated at specific hospi - tals for unified treatment according to the government emergency rule . All data enrolled in our study had been shared with WHO and the preliminary results were re - ported to the authority of Zhejiang Province . Information of medical records were gathered and sent to the data collection center in Hangzhou . Demographic , epidemiological , clinical , laboratory , treatments and out - comes data were exacted from electronic medical re - cords using a standardized data collection form . A group of doctors who have experiences in treating the patients with COVID - 19 reviewed and disposed the data . When information was incomplete , the working team in Hangzhou would contact the doctor in charge for explanation . This study was approved by the Clinical Research Eth - ics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital , College of Medicine , Zhejiang University ( No . IIT20200005C ) . Written informed consent was waived by the ethics commission of the designated hospital , and oral consent was obtained from patients . Procedures Sputum and throat swab specimens collected from all patients were tested by RT - PCR for SARS - CoV - 2 RNA . Briefly , the CDC of Zhejiang Province and at municipal level , and the First Affiliated Hospital , School of Medi - cine , Zhejiang University were responsible for confirm - ation of SARS - CoV - 2 , with national authorization . Laboratory tests were conducted on admission , includ - ing blood routine examinations , serum biochemical tests , coagulation function examinations , infection - related bio - markers , and an identification of other respiratory path - ogens such as influenza A virus , influenza B virus , Zhang et al . Infectious Diseases of Poverty ( 2020 ) 9 : 85 Page 2 of 10 parainfluenza virus , adenovirus and respiratory syncytial virus . Chest radiograph or computed tomography ( CT ) was done for all inpatients at admission . Treatment mea - sures and outcomes were followed up to 12 February 2020 . Case definitions The illness severity of COVID - 19 was defined according to the Chinese management guideline for COVID - 19 ( version 6 . 0 ) [ 13 ] . Patients with COVID - 19 was catego - rized as mild , common , severe , and critical according to the illness severity . Mild type was defined as mild symp - toms and no pneumonia on imaging . Common type was defined as having respiratory tract symptoms and im - aging with pneumonia . Severe type was defined as satis - fying any of the following items : 1 ) respiratory distress and respiratory frequency ≥ 30 / min ; 2 ) blood oxygen sat - uration ≤ 93 % at rest ; 3 ) PaO 2 / FiO 2 ratio ≤ 300 mmHg ; 4 ) Lung infiltrates > 50 % within 24 – 48 h . Critical type was defined as satisfying any of the following items : 1 ) re - spiratory failure occurs and require mechanical ventila - tion ; 2 ) shock occurs ; 3 ) combined with other organ failure and requires ICU monitoring and treatment . The incubation period was defined as the time from exposure to the onset of illness , which was estimated among pa - tients who could provide the exact data of close contact with confirmed or suspected individuals . Family cluster was defined as occurring two or more cases with fever and / or respiratory symptoms within the family in recent 2 weeks . Fever was defined as axillary temperature of at least 37 . 3 °C . Gastrointestinal symptoms included nau - sea , emesis and diarrhea . Discharge criteria Once the temperature returned to normal for more than 3 days , respiratory symptoms significantly improved , the imaging of lung obviously absorbed , and two consecutive negative results for SARS - CoV - 2 antigen ( sampling interval at least 1 day ) , patients could be discharged from hospital . Statistical analysis Continuous variables were presented as median ( inter - quartile range [ IQR ] ) and compared using Kruskal - Wallis . Categorical variables were presented as frequency ( percentages ) , and compared using the χ 2 test or Fisher ’ s exact test when appropriate . To analyze risk factors for the severity of illness in pa - tients with COVID - 19 , univariate and multivariate or - dinal logistic regression models were used . Variables with P < 0 . 05 in the univariate models were selected into the multivariate model for calculating . A two - sided α of < 0 . 05 was considered statistically significant . All the analyses were done with SPSS version 25 . 0 ( IBM Cor - poration , Armonk , NY , USA ) . The Kaplan - Meier method was used to estimate hospitalization time , and the log rank test was applied for comparisons among mild , common , and severe type . The Kaplan - Meier analysis was performed using ‘ sur - vival ’ packages in R version 3 . 6 . 1 ( R Foundation , Vienna , Austria ) . Results Demographic , epidemiologic , and clinical characteristics From 17 January 2020 to 12 February 2020 , clinical data were collected on 788 patients with COVID - 19 in Zhe - jiang Province . According to the definition of clinical classification , they were divided into 52 cases ( 6 . 6 % ) of mild type , 658 cases ( 83 . 5 % ) of common type , 61 cases ( 7 . 7 % ) of severe type , and 17 cases ( 2 . 2 % ) of critical type . As shown in Table 1 , the median age in mild , com - mon , severe , and critical type was 37 . 5 years ( IQR : 19 . 3 – 45 . 8 ) , 45 . 0 years ( IQR : 35 . 0 – 55 . 0 ) , 55 . 0 years ( IQR : 44 . 0 – 62 . 0 ) , and 70 . 0 years ( IQR : 55 . 0 – 73 . 0 ) . The proportion of male patients was account for 50 . 0 , 50 . 0 , 63 . 9 and 76 . 5 % , respectively . Hypertension was the most common underlying disease and there were significant differences among the four subtypes ( 9 . 6 % vs 13 . 2 % vs 31 . 1 % vs 88 . 2 % , P < 0 . 001 ) . In both severe and critical type , the ra - tio of patients with gastrointestinal symptoms exceeded 15 % . Laboratory and radiograph findings On admission , the majority of leucocyte in all subtypes were normal or decreased . As shown in Table 2 , the four types had significant differences in neutrophil count , lymphocyte count , platelets count , albumin ( ALB ) , as - partate aminotransferase ( AST ) , sodium , blood urea ni - trogen ( BUN ) , creatinine ( CR ) , creatinine kinase ( CK ) , lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) , C - reactive protein ( CRP ) and procalcitonin ( PCT ) ( P < 0 . 05 ) . In contrast , there were no significant differences in hemoglobin , Inter - national normalized ration ( INR ) , alanine aminotransfer - ase ( ALT ) , total bilirubin ( TB ) and potassium ( P > 0 . 05 ) . Multiple mottling and ground - glass opacity were typ - ical imaging manifestations of patients with COVID - 19 . The proportion of it in common , severe , and critical type were 27 . 8 , 60 . 7 , and 88 . 2 % , respectively . Treatments and outcomes Patients with COVID - 19 were quarantined in designated hospital and a total of 668 patients received antiviral treatments in our research . As shown in Table 3 , interferon - α inhalation , lopinavir / ritonavir and arbidol were the most commonplace antiviral regimen in all subtypes . Glucocorticoids were not used in mild type , but in all critical types , and there were significant Zhang et al . Infectious Diseases of Poverty ( 2020 ) 9 : 85 Page 3 of 10 differences in the use among the four types ( 0 . 0 % vs 8 . 2 % vs 47 . 5 % vs 100 . 0 % , P < 0 . 001 ) . Similar to glucocor - ticoids , there were significant differences among the four types based on the use intravenous immunoglobulin ( 0 . 0 % vs 3 . 6 % vs 42 . 6 % vs 70 . 6 % , P < 0 . 001 ) . Till 12 Feb - ruary 2020 , none of patients used extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ECMO ) and continuous renal - replacement therapy ( CRRT ) . At the endpoint of our study , 21 cases ( 40 . 4 % ) of mild type , 273 cases ( 41 . 5 % ) of common type , 27 cases ( 44 . 3 % ) of severe type , and 1 case ( 5 . 9 % ) of critical type discharged from hospital , and none of the patients died .

Infectious Diseases of Poverty ( 2020 ) 9 : 85 Page 4 of 10 Kaplan - Meier analysis showed a significant difference in hospitalization time among mild type , common type and severe type ( Fig . 1 ) . Risk factors for the severity of illness in patients with COVID - 19 As shown in Table 4 , the variables with P < 0 . 05 in the univariate ordinal logistic regression model were selected into the multivariate ordinal logistic regression model for the severity of illness in patients with COVID - 19 . There was no multicollinearity within the variables in the final model . Results of multivariate ordinal logistic regression showed the severity of illness was relevant to the age - grading , sex , fever , cough , hemoptysis , gastro - intestinal symptoms and hypertension . Multivariate or - dinal logistic regression demonstrated increasing odds of the severity of illness in patients with COVID - 19 associ - ated with male ( odds ratio [ OR ] = 1 . 7 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] : 1 . 2 – 2 . 6 , P = 0 . 008 ) , fever ( OR = 3 . 6 , 95 % CI : 2 . 1 – 6 . 3 , P < 0 . 001 ) , cough ( OR = 1 . 7 , 95 % CI : 1 . 0 – 2 . 9 , P = 0 . 041 ) , hemoptysis ( OR = 3 . 4 , 95 % CI : 1 . 1 – 10 . 3 , P = 0 . 032 ) , gastrointestinal symptoms ( OR = 1 . 9 , 95 % CI : 1 . 0 – 3 . 5 , P = 0 . 047 ) , hypertension ( OR = 2 . 6 , 95 % CI : 1 . 2 – 5 . 6 , P = 0 . 013 ) . With the increase of age - grading , the risk for the severity was gradually higher ( ≤ 18 years [ OR = 1 . 0 ] , 19 – 40 years [ OR = 12 . 7 , 95 % CI : 4 . 5 – 36 . 0 , Table 2 Laboratory and radiograph findings of different subtypes in patients with COVID - 19 on admission Variable Mild type ( n = 52 ) Common type ( n = 658 ) Severe type ( n = 61 ) Critical type ( n = 17 ) P value Blood routine Leucocyte count ( × 10 9 / L ) 5 . 7 ( 4 . 3 – 7 . 1 ) 4 . 7 ( 3 . 8 – 5 . 8 ) 4 . 9 ( 3 . 8 – 6 . 6 ) 6 . 8 ( 3 . 8 – 8 . 8 ) 0 . 002 < 4 9 ( 17 . 3 ) 201 ( 30 . 5 ) 19 ( 31 . 1 ) 5 ( 29 . 4 ) > 10 1 ( 1 . 9 ) 10 ( 1 . 5 ) 4 ( 6 . 6 ) 3 ( 17 . 6 ) Neutrophil count ( × 10 9 / L ) 3 . 6 ( 2 . 0 – 5 . 0 ) 2 . 9 ( 2 . 2 – 3 . 8 ) 3 . 2 ( 2 . 6 – 5 . 0 ) 5 . 8 ( 2 . 8 – 8 . 0 ) < 0 . 001 > 7 3 ( 5 . 8 ) 17 ( 2 . 6 ) 7 ( 11 . 5 ) 7 ( 41 . 2 ) Lymphocyte count ( × 10 9 / L ) 1 . 3 ( 1 . 1 – 1 . 9 ) 1 . 2 ( 0 . 9 – 1 . 6 ) 0 . 9 ( 0 . 6 – 1 . 2 ) 0 . 5 ( 0 . 4 – 0 . 8 ) < 0 . 001 < 0 . 8 8 ( 15 . 4 ) 91 ( 13 . 8 ) 23 ( 37 . 7 ) 12 ( 70 . 6 ) Hemoglobin ( g / L ) 139 . 0 ( 131 . 0 – 152 . 0 ) 138 . 0 ( 127 . 0 – 150 . 0 ) 139 . 0 ( 122 . 5 – 153 . 0 ) 128 . 0 ( 117 . 0 – 153 . 5 ) 0 . 332 Platelets count ( ×10 9 / L ) 206 . 0 ( 171 . 0 – 241 . 3 ) 180 . 0 ( 147 . 8 – 221 . 3 ) 172 . 0 ( 138 . 0 – 214 . 0 ) 146 . 0 ( 122 . 0 – 181 . 5 ) 0 . 001 < 100 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 23 ( 3 . 5 ) 2 ( 3 . 3 ) 2 ( 11 . 8 ) Coagulation function International normalized ration ( INR ) 1 . 0 ( 1 . 0 – 1 . 1 ) 1 . 0 ( 1 . 0 – 1 . 1 ) 1 . 0 ( 1 . 0 – 1 . 1 ) 1 . 0 ( 1 . 0 – 1 . 2 ) 0 . 070 Blood biochemistry Albumin ( ALB , g / L ) 42 . 5 ( 40 . 5 – 45 . 7 ) 41 . 7 ( 38 . 7 – 43 . 9 ) 38 . 7 ( 35 . 8 – 41 . 6 ) 35 . 9 ( 30 . 8 – 37 . 6 ) < 0 . 001 Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT , U / L ) 20 . 0 ( 12 . 0 – 39 . 1 ) 21 . 1 ( 15 . 0 – 33 . 0 ) 24 . 0 ( 16 . 5 – 34 . 5 ) 20 . 5 ( 14 . 0 – 30 . 8 ) 0 . 528 Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST , U / L ) 22 . 0 ( 16 . 5 – 34 . 0 ) 25 . 0 ( 19 . 1 – 32 . 2 ) 28 . 0 ( 22 . 0 – 40 . 0 ) 30 . 5 ( 25 . 0 – 41 . 8 ) 0 . 002 > 40 7 ( 13 . 5 ) 76 ( 11 . 6 ) 13 ( 21 . 3 ) 5 ( 29 . 4 ) Total bilirubin ( TB ) ( μ mol / / L ) 8 . 8 ( 6 . 2 – 11 . 6 ) 9 . 5 ( 7 . 0 – 13 . 1 ) 10 . 7 ( 7 . 8 – 15 . 6 ) 10 . 3 ( 8 . 0 – 14 . 6 ) 0 . 205 Potassium ( mmol / L ) 3 . 8 ( 3 . 6 – 4 . 2 ) 3 . 8 ( 3 . 6 – 4 . 1 ) 3 . 9 ( 3 . 6 – 4 . 2 ) 3 . 7 ( 3 . 2 – 3 . 9 ) 0 . 112 Sodium ( mmol / L ) 139 . 0 ( 138 . 0 – 141 . 0 ) 138 . 5 ( 136 . 3 – 140 . 2 ) 137 . 4 ( 135 . 0 – 139 . 3 ) 136 . 0 ( 130 . 1 – 137 . 8 ) < 0 . 001 Blood urea nitrogen ( BUN , mmol / L ) 4 . 2 ( 3 . 2 – 4 . 7 ) 3 . 7 ( 3 . 0 – 4 . 6 ) 4 . 0 ( 3 . 2 – 5 . 6 ) 5 . 8 ( 3 . 6 – 12 . 3 ) 0 . 001 Creatinine ( CR , μ mol / L ) 66 . 0 ( 58 . 0 – 76 . 0 ) 65 . 3 ( 55 . 0 – 78 . 0 ) 71 . 0 ( 62 . 5 – 80 . 5 ) 79 . 0 ( 65 . 9 – 106 . 5 ) 0 . 002 Creatinine kinase ( CK , U / L ) 60 . 5 ( 42 . 5 – 75 . 3 ) 68 . 5 ( 47 . 0 – 105 . 3 ) 76 . 0 ( 56 . 5 – 120 . 5 ) 146 . 0 ( 54 . 3 – 255 . 5 ) < 0 . 001 Lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH , U / L ) 175 . 0 ( 147 . 0 – 241 . 0 ) 207 . 5 ( 168 . 0 – 254 . 0 ) 272 . 0 ( 221 . 5 – 366 . 5 ) 320 . 5 ( 256 . 3 – 356 . 5 ) < 0 . 001 > 250 11 ( 21 . 2 ) 167 ( 25 . 4 ) 39 ( 63 . 9 ) 13 ( 76 . 5 ) Infection - related biomarkers C - reactive protein ( CRP , mg / L ) 1 . 9 ( 0 . 5 – 5 . 5 ) 7 . 7 ( 2 . 5 – 19 . 4 ) 26 . 2 ( 10 . 4 – 51 . 1 ) 45 . 5 ( 14 . 7 – 84 . 9 ) < 0 . 001 Procalcitonin ( PCT , ng / ml ) 0 . 1 ( 0 . 0 – 0 . 1 ) 0 . 1 ( 0 . 0 – 0 . 1 ) 0 . 1 ( 0 . 0 – 0 . 1 ) 0 . 1 ( 0 . 0 – 0 . 2 ) 0 . 013 Chest x - ray / CT finding Multiple mottling and ground - glass opacity 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 183 ( 27 . 8 ) 37 ( 60 . 7 ) 15 ( 88 . 2 ) < 0 . 001 Data are presented as medians ( interquartile ranges , IQR ) , n ( % ) and n / N ( % ) Zhang et al .

Discussion The outbreak of COVID - 19 is now becoming an enor - mous threat to public health . With further research of the structure and infection mechanism of respiratory , scientists found angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ( ACE2 ) might be the site of SARS - CoV - 2 binding on the surface of cells , with the same route of infection of SARS - CoV [ 14 ] . It has been proved that ACE2 might play an important role in virus transmission and infec - tion . SARS - CoV - 2 not only attacked the lung but also caused damages to many other organs , including heart , kidney , liver and central nervous system [ 3 , 6 , 15 , 16 ] . The diagnosis of COVID - 19 was complicated by the di - versity in symptoms , imaging findings and the severity of illness , therefore , describing features of each subtype and exploring risk factors for the severity of illness could help clinicians to better tackle with this disease . In this respective study , the median age of critical types was higher than the other three types , with the reason of low immunity and degeneration of related physiological function in older . The length of the incu - bation period is related to many factors , such as the number of pathogens , the time required for toxin pro - duction and transmission , and human immunity .

Infectious Diseases of Poverty ( 2020 ) 9 : 85 Page 7 of 10 incubation period was shorter in severe type , probably due to poor immunity and higher viral load [ 17 ] . Fever and cough were the dominant symptoms in all subtypes , while hemoptysis was rare . Fever is a protective mechan - ism by activating the immune systems to resist patho - gens , and cough is a reflective defense against invaders . When an individual was infected , the above two symp - toms generally appeared at early stage . Although hemoptysis was an atypical symptom , it was reported that there was COVID - 19 patient admitted only with hemoptysis as the initial symptom [ 18 ] . Moreover , we should be alert to the patients who didn ’ t have a fever , due to 6 . 6 % of severe type without fever in our study . Hypertension and diabetes were the most pervasive underlying diseases in all subtypes , and the proportion of them were higher in critical type . In consideration of the aged constituting the majority of the critical type , it is common that the rates of comorbidities increased . According to the laboratory results , the decrease of lymphocyte occurred in 70 . 6 % of critical type . The de - crease of lymphocyte was a prominent feature of critical type in our cohort which was consistent with a previous study [ 19 ] . SARS - CoV - 2 might mainly act on lympho - cyte , especially T lymphocytes , as did SARS - CoV [ 6 ] . In addition , the increased AST and LDH implied a poten - tial of liver and heart damage which was more common in severe and critical types . Currently , there is no effective antiviral treatment for COVID - 19 [ 20 ] . In the light of the previous clinical ex - perience , interferon - α , lopinavir / ritonavir and arbidol were applied for antiviral therapy in our hospital , how - ever , the therapeutic regimen was not researched a con - sensus among hospitals . A retrospective study identified that proper use of corticosteroid in critical type with SARS could lead to a lower mortality and shorter hospitalization stay [ 21 ] . In our study , the dosage of glu - cocorticoids was limited to 40 – 80 mg / d to avoid side ef - fects . Until 12 February 2020 , 21 cases ( 40 . 4 % ) of mild type , 273 cases ( 41 . 5 % ) of common type , 27 cases ( 44 . 3 % ) of severe type , and 1 case ( 5 . 9 % ) of critical type discharged from hospital . Compared with initial patients infected with SARS - CoV - 2 in Wuhan , the illness condition of patients in Zhejiang Province are relatively milder . None of the pa - tients died at the end of our follow - up . This feature is obviously different from researches in Wuhan which re - ported a higher mortality [ 10 , 19 ] . At early stage of out - break of COVID - 19 in Wuhan , shortage of local medical resources , insufficient understanding of this disease and no effective drugs might contribute to this phenomenon . Several risk factors for the severity of illness in patients with COVID - 19 were identified in our study including male , fever , cough , hemoptysis , gastrointestinal symp - toms , hypertension , and higher age - grading . Several studies demonstrated that differences in COVID - 19 dis - ease prevalence and severity were associated with sex , which was similar to our results [ 3 , 6 , 19 ] . One study , using single - cell sequencing , found that expression of ACE2 was more predominant in Asian men [ 22 ] . During the evolution , females develop enhanced innate and adaptive immune responses than males and are less sus - ceptible to viral infections [ 23 ] . These above two points might be the reasons for the higher prevalence and se - verity of COVID - 19 in men than in women . Addition - ally , in our study , the presence of any one of the comorbidities was higher in male compared with female ( 30 . 7 % vs 24 . 4 % , P = 0 . 048 ) . We thought this result might also partly explain why men are more prone to se - verity illness . Our study found increasing odds of the severity of ill - ness was associated with gastrointestinal symptoms . A bioinformatics analysis on single - cell transcriptomes demonstrated that ACE2 was not only highly expressed in the lung AT2 cells , esophagus upper and stratified epithelial cells but also in absorptive enterocytes from ileum and colon . Recently , two independent laboratories from China declared that they have successfully isolated live SARS - CoV - 2 from the stool of patients [ 24 ] . An in - creasing number of studies remind us that digestive sys - tem might serve as an alternative route of infection for SARS - CoV - 2 [ 25 ] . We consider the digestive tract trans - mission of SARS - CoV - 2 might impair the function of in - testinal mucosal barriers and increase the production of inflammatory factors , further aggravating the severity of illness . In addition , COVID - 19 patients combined with hyper - tension were at higher risk for the illness severity in our study . Renin - angiotensin system ( RAS ) plays an import - ant role in the pathogenesis of hypertension . It could be simply summarized as two axes , one is ACE - Ang II - AT1 axis responsible for constriction of blood vessels , and the other is ACE2 - Ang - ( 1 – 7 ) - Mas axis with the opposite effect [ 26 , 27 ] . Generally , the two axes could interact with each other and maintain the blood pressure bal - ance . However , the balance would be broken in hyper - tension , with the result of a lower expression of ACE2 . Once infected by SARS - CoV - 2 , the level of ACE2 would be even lower , followed by intensified Ang II activity . Ang II would further promote vasoconstriction , increase vascular permeability and mediate inflammatory re - sponses , leading to illness aggravation . There are several limitations in our study . Firstly , the retrospective design of our study might affect integrality of data and diminish its credibility , and more prospective cohort studies should be on the agenda in the future . Secondly , patients enrolled in our study only come from Zhejiang Province , and large - scale researches at the na - tional level were urgently needed which could provide Zhang et al . Infectious Diseases of Poverty ( 2020 ) 9 : 85 Page 8 of 10 more reliable and comprehensive data . Thirdly , changes of the illness in different subtypes needed to be further investigated . A model for predicting the changes of dis - ease was necessary for clinicians to better guide treat - ments . Moreover , laboratory results were not included in ordinal logistic regression model to explore risk fac - tors for the severity of illness , due to the normal range of some indicators varied from different hospitals . Conclusions In summary , our study reported the largest cases of pa - tients with COVID - 19 in Zhejiang Province , and indi - cated risk factors of illness severity which was of great significance for early identification and prompt treat - ment . Based on the research findings , we recommend that clinicians should pay close attention to these fea - tures in patients with COVID - 19 including older age , male , fever , cough , hemoptysis , gastrointestinal symp - toms and hypertension , and strengthen self - protection during the outbreak of COVID - 19 .
