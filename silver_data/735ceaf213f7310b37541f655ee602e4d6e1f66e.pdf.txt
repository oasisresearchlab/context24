The input consists of one or more images of a labeled focal adhesion protein . The outputs of the system include a range of static and dynamic measurements for the adhesions present in each image as well as how these properties change over time . The user is able to adjust several parameters important for proper focal adhesion identification . This system provides a straightforward tool for the global , unbiased assessment of focal adhesion behavior common in optical microscopy studies .

Traditionally , the resulting images are analyzed using NIH ImageJ 1 or related tools , but we have recently developed a set of computer - vision algorithms designed to automate many of these analysis steps . These core meth - ods have been documented in a prior publication 2 and made avail - able as an open source download ; however , they require substantial exper tise with the command line interface for their use . With the focal adhesion analysis server ( FAAS ) , we have created a web ap - plication that allows users to submit time - lapse fluorescence image sets of FA proteins and have these images automatically analyzed . The methods implemented by the analysis system have been previ - ously used in several studies to investigate the quantitative proper - ties of FAs in cells under various conditions . For example , adhesion static and dynamic properties were quantified with fluorescently la - beled FAK , vinculin and paxillin 3 – 5 . Global , whole - cell changes to adhesion and cytoskeletal architecture when the Arp 2 / 3 complex is disabled have also been characterized 4 . By integrating these image analysis methods into a straightforward web application , we hope to make them more broadly accessible to the cell - imaging community . Features The primary interface is a set of webpages that allow a user to up - load a stacked tiff set of images for processing . After the images are uploaded to the server , the processing pipeline is run , and the results are returned as a downloadable zip file . This results file contains all the intermediate processing steps as well as a set of visualizations . These visualizations show which regions of the cell were identified as adhesions and how the tracking algorithm followed single adhe - sions through time ( Figure 1 ) . FA properties and visualizations The analysis pipeline extracts and quantifies a wide range of prop - erties . FA properties characterized in each individual image include adhesion area , marker protein intensity and the lengths of the major and minor axes . In addition to these static properties , the system also collects dynamic adhesion properties , which are quantified by recording the changes in individual adhesions between frames in the image stack . Dynamic properties currently include the FA assem bly and disassembly rates 6 and the focal adhesion alignment index 4 . All of these results are saved in CSV format , which is suit - able for import into statisti cal or graphing software . For users only interested in static results derived from individual images , as in an analysis of a set of fixed - cell images , all the other dynamic proper - ties can be safely ignored . The user is also provided with two types of visualizations that show either the entire field of view or single adhesions over time . The visualization of the entire field of view is produced for every image in the submitted image set and outlines each adhesion with a unique color ( Figure 1 ) . This visualization can be used to verify that the adhesions were correctly detected , segmented and tracked . The second visualization type shows a single adhesion segmented and tracked through time ( Figure 1 ) . Provided that adhesions are present for at least 10 sequential imag - es , this visualization allows the user to compare an individual FA’s properties with the appearance of the adhesion in the original image data . This suite of automatically extracted properties and visualiza - tions enables the user to minimize the amount of laborious manual analysis normally required to quantify FA image sets . User adjustable parameters Several of the parameters used to analyze the images can be speci - fied when an image set is submitted for analysis . The most important of these is the threshold used to identify the regions of the image that qualify as FAs versus background . The appropriate threshold Figure 1 . Sample input images and output visualization from the focal adhesion processing pipeline . The results section shows examples from the visualizations produced by the pipeline . In the top example , the entire cell is shown , with an individual adhesion outlined and tracked through time . The bottom three examples show single adhesions , outlined in green , with other nearby adhesions outlined in blue .

To make setting this parameter easier , we have added a feature where a single image can be submitted , segmented using various thresholds and then immediately returned to the user for vis - ual inspection of the results obtained when the threshold is varied . The user also has the option to turn off the default watershed - based segmentation that is used to split adjacent FAs and modify the mini - mum or maximum FA size accepted by the system . Finally , the time between images can also be specified to ensure that the calculation of the rates of assembly or disassembly are made in the correct units . Users have the option of providing an email address when an im - age set is submitted . If an email address is provided , notification of the completion of the image processing pipeline , along with a link to download the results , is sent . The system can also be used with - out an email address , but the user must return to the web interface to check on the status of the processing . The processing time is dependent on the number of images in the set and how many adhe - sions are detected during processing . Using typical input data , we tested the system throughput and found that the average processing and analysis time per image , under full load , is 13 seconds . Because the system can handle four image sets at once , we expect experi - mental throughput to be acceptable for everyday usage . Conclusion The Focal Adhesion Analysis Server provides an automated im - age processing pipeline in an easy - to - use web - based application . A wide range of FA properties are automatically collected from the image sets submitted , and the results are returned in CSV formatted files . Users have the option to adjust the parameters used to process their image sets to suit their specific imaging conditions and cell types of interest .

Kenneth Yamada Laboratory of Cell & Developmental Biology , National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research , National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , MD , USA This automated web - based analysis system provides a helpful system for considerably simplifying analyses of dynamic focal adhesions of cells in 2D cell culture . Although two examples of the analysis of single adhesions are clear , the example at the bottom left of Figure 1 seems to show appearance of a rather large , complex , multi - pronged cell adhesion that may be a composite of several smaller focal adhesions – it may be useful to discuss this conceptual issue briefly .
