Universally , synthetic biomaterials are conjugated with a linear or cyclic Arg - Gly - Asp ( RGD ) peptide to establish a direct link of the ECM with the cell . These peptides , however , present low binding affinities and lack selectivity towards integrin subtypes presented on the cell membrane . Here , a highly biomimetic synthetic ECM based on polyisocyanides ( PIC ) that has been decorated with bicyclic peptides that show a high affinity towards specific integrin subtypes is presented . 3D cell studies show that human adipose - derived stem cells ( hASCs ) in matrices carrying the optimized bicyclic α 5 β 1 - integrin binder , spread within 24 hours , which is much faster than in other PIC gels , including the default RGD - decorated gel , but also much faster than in the positive Matrigel control . YAP / TAZ staining shows that the rapid morphological change in the 3D microenvironments is YAP independent . The data highlights that the design of synthetic matrices with appropriate , optimized guiding signals is key to guide cells towards a predetermined outcome . – 2 – Introduction Human tissue is a complex system consisting of cells and the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) . The latter supports the structural integrity of the tissue and has profound effects on the embedded cells . For instance , the ECM supports cell adhesion , regulates growth factor presentation to mediate cell functions and is involved in the activation of many cell signaling pathways 1 . Cells sense their microenvironment and show a corresponding biological response 2 . Integrins form the physical connection between a cell and its extracellular matrix . They are allosteric transmembrane proteins that mediate bi - directional interactions between cells and their ( micro ) environment and , as such , they play a central role in communication 3 , 4 . On the intracellular side , integrins interact with a range of adhesion - supporting proteins and signaling factors to form force - responsive adhesion complexes . These complexes bind the actomyosin cytoskeleton , regulating downstream signaling pathways that allow the cell to react to physical cues . Reciprocally , on the extracellular side where the integrins bind to the ECM , cell contraction leads to a change in the architecture and mechanical properties of the cellular microenvironment . Functional integrins consist of two non‐covalently bound transmembrane subunits , named α and β . On human cells , 24 heterodimers have been observed experimentally , which are composed of combinations of 18 α and 8 β subunits 5 , 6 . Cells have phenotype - dependent presentation of integrins and the integrin expression may change in physiological or pathological processes , for instance , during stem cell differentiation 7 or in cancer 8 . Interestingly , selectivity is not always high for ECM - integrin interactions , e . g . , collagen and laminin , two major ECM proteins , both bind α 1 β 1 and α 2 β 1 integrins . Laminin additionally binds with α 5 β 1 integrins , which in turn , also interacts with fibronectin . In 1984 , a tripeptide sequence Arg - Gly - Asp ( RGD ) was identified as a principle integrin - binding domain 9 . This peptide , subsequently , has become the golden standard in research involving cell - adhesion 10 , particularly in synthetic microenvironments . The advantages of this classic sequence include its stability during sample preparation and processing , its minor immune response and the availability of simple and economical conjugation strategies , for instance , via click chemistry 11 . Together , they make RGD and its derivatives the primary choices to induce a cell - adhesion in a non - biofunctional material . The simple RGD peptide also has some clear drawbacks . In the absence of a secondary structure of the RGD peptide , cell anchoring through the integrin is not comparable to the full - length proteinprotein 12 , 13 . Furthermore , RGD binds generically to multiple integrin subtypes and cannot be used when a specific heterodimer needs to be targeted , which limits the possibility of activation of specific desired intracellular pathways . To pursue a stronger and more selective binding towards integrins , cyclic peptides have been developed 14 . In 2D in vitro settings , these peptides have been shown to promote cell adhesion to gel substrates 15 , 16 and cell membrane binding 14 . In this work , we introduce combinatorically optimized cyclic peptides in a highly biomimetic , but fully synthetic hydrogel based on polyisocyanides to study cell behavior in a controlled in vivo - like microenvironment . Our first results show the dramatic effects that binding optimization offers but , ultimately , we present a new method that allows one to start targeting specific integrins to guide desired cell behavior such as migration , stem cell differentiation , and angiogenesis 17 . – 3 – Results and Discussion As the synthetic biomimetic matrix , we employed polyisocyanide ( PIC ) gels 18 . This polymer - based fibrous hydrogel is developing into an ideal synthetic three - dimensional artificial ECM 19 - 21 . PIC gels combine an architecture and ( nonlinear ) mechanics that are common to hydrogels of natural ECM polymers and possess excellent biocompatibility 22 with high customizability in mechanical properties and biofunctionalization . We exploited the straightforward customization strategies to introduce 9 different adhesive peptides ( Table 1 ) , including the routinely used linear GRGDS ( P1 ) , the cyclic fKRGD ( P2 ) , the knottin peptide ( P3 , optimized for strong integrin binding ) and a series of recently reported constrained , bicyclic peptides 14 , 23 that have been optimized for strong and selective integrin binding 24 ( P4 - P9 ) . For conjugation , we employed the highly efficient strain - promoted azide - alkyne cycloaddition ( SPAAC ) reaction 25 , 26 between the azide ( N 3 ) - functionalized PIC polymers and the bicyclononyne - terminated peptides 16 using earlier developed protocols 19 . To drive the conjugation reaction to completion , an excess of N 3 groups is used 27 . The design of our 3D cell culture model system is displayed in Figure 1 . The final peptide concentration after cell encapsulation is 63 μM , which is considered low , compared to other synthetic matrices 28 - 31 . Table 1 .

PIC hydrogels were prepared by dissolving the ( peptide - functionalized ) polymer in cold cell culture medium and heating the solution beyond the gelation temperature T gel ≈ 15 °C . For all hydrogels , the low peptide concentrations do not influence the gelation temperature of the polymer . At 2 mg mL −1 and 37 °C , all PIC gels form relatively soft hydrogels with storage moduli between 200 – 500 Pa , depending on the peptide attached . Note that the PIC polymer without peptides forms a slightly stiffer gel ( P0 ) . – 4 – Earlier reports quantified the binding of the peptides towards different target integrins : α 5 β 1 , α v β 3 and α v β 5 ( Table 1 ) . The routinely applied linear GRGDS binds weakly to all integrins ; while the frequent applied cyclic RGD ( in P2 ) has a higher binding affinity , but only towards the α v β 3 and α v β 5 heterodimers . The engineered knottin RGD , however , strongly interacts with all three integrin dimers ( α 5 β 1 , α v β 3 and α v β 5 ) . Of the two groups of optimized bicyclic peptides , the first group selectively binds α v β 3 integrins ( P4 – P6 ) while the second is selective for α 5 β 1 ( in P7 – P9 ) . Matrigel ( P10 ) was used as the ‘golden standard’ reference material in the 3D cell culture field . We tested the role of the integrins in cell culture with human adipose - derived stem cells ( hASCs ) . Earlier work has shown that somatic stem cells are highly sensitive to their ( mechanical ) microenvironment 33 , to which they anchor through their integrins . In the case of hASCs , it has been observed that α 5 β 1 is highly expressed during the undifferentiated state 7 . We encapsulated hASCs in ( 200 , 000 cells mL – 1 ) in every gel and cell viability ( LIVE / DEAD staining ) measurements after 72 h indicate that all gels are fully biocompatible ( Figure S3 ) . The influence of the different integrin binding peptides in cellular behavior was evaluated by monitoring cell morphological responses ( spreading and migration ) in the first 24 hours after encapsulation . We Figure 1 .

For PIC , the ratio between azide and methoxy - terminated monomers is set to 1 : 29 ( x = 0 . 033 ) , but only ~ 1 % of the monomer later is substituted with a peptide . b , Structure of linear ( P1 ) , monocyclic ( P2 ) and bicyclic peptides ( P4 – P9 ) using single letter ami no acid codes .

P3 is not presented in this figure due to its complex structure . c , For stem cell studies , we generated a synthetic fibrous microenvironment with a single cell adhesion peptide clicked onto the polymer backbone . P1 P5 P4 P6 P2 P8 P7 P9 BCN peptide spacer PIC PIC integrin a b peptides : C – 5 – focused on the initial time period to minimize the contribution of the extracellular matrix deposited by the stem cells . Analysis of bright field images ( Figure S4 ) shows that 24 hours after encapsulation , the stem cells are still primarily spherical in all matrices , apart from P8 , where a network of spread cells was imaged . Based on the IC 50 values , gels with P8 are expected to have a strong interaction with the α 5 β 1 integrin , which is expressed by the stem cells . While P7 and P9 are decorated with peptides that bind similarly strong , the encapsulated cells in the corresponding gels remain mostly spherical . Similarly , in gels with the generic strong binder P3 , no morphological changes are observed . We underline that integrin binding constants were determined by ELISA with the peptides only and that conjugation of the peptides to a polymer backbone may induce a different functionality as is sensed by the cells . Based on this data , we selected 5 culture matrices for more quantitative analysis of the role of the peptide on cell behavior : P0 ( no peptide , negative control ) , P1 ( default GRGDS peptide ) , P4 and P8 ( bicyclic peptides with high affinity for either the α v β 3 or the α 5 β 1 integrin receptor , resp . ) and Matrigel ( P10 ) as a biological reference material containing abundant collagen ( affinity towards α 2 β 1 integrins ) 34 , and laminin ( that binds α 1 β 1 , α 2 β 1 α 3 β 1 , α 6 β 1 and α 7 β 1 integrins ) 35 . Time - lapse bright field microscopy ( Supplementary Movies M1 – M5 ) clearly shows the remarkably fast spreading of cells in P8 , in contrast to the other samples ( Figure 2a shows images at 7 and 24 h ; Figure 2b , images at 1 , 3 , 5 and 7 h of P8 only ) . As a measure for spreading , we determined cell circularity for ~ 20 representative and isolated cells . Quantitative analysis using FIJI ( Figure 2c ) , indeed confirms that already after 3 h , hASCs in P8 are significantly different from cells in any of the other matrices , including Matrigel ( Figure 2c ) . Even at 24 h , the cells in the other matrices still show a rounded morphology , compared to a well - developed cellular network in P8 . Confocal fluorescence imaging of F - actin stained samples ( 24 h ) confirms the results observed in the bright field images ( Figure 2d ) . Experiments to dilute the density of peptides in P8 ( by culturing hASCs in mixed P8 / P0 hydrogels ) shows that 63 μM is the minimum peptide concentration to obtain extensive spreading ( Figure S5 ) . Yes - associated protein ( YAP ) and the co - activator TAZ are key mechanotransduction components that translocate from the cytosol to the cell nucleus upon mechanical cues from the cellular microenvironment 36 . Given the rapid cell spreading in P8 , we evaluated YAP activation in our samples . Interestingly , immunostaining reveals that there is no significant YAP localization in cell nuclei in either condition , implying that within 24 hours , the YAP / TAZ mechanotransduction pathway is not activated in hASCs in these 3D hydrogels ( Figure S6 ) . Our results contradict findings from 2D cell culture 36 that can give rapid nuclear translocation but are in line with the other recent findings from 3D cell cultures , where no redistribution of YAP is observed 37 . Indeed , the lack of actin stress fibers , the decrease of nuclear content per cross - section and low volumes of the cells may cause the difference between the 2D and 3D microenvironments . Also , we suspect that , as a result of the short culture time , the YAP pathway may not have been activated yet . In conclusion , the data suggest that YAP / TAZ is not involved in the observed rapid spreading of stem cells in the first 24 hours . – 6 – Figure 2 .

The migration of cells in a 3D microenvironment is an extremely intricate reciprocal process 39 , which also includes matrix degradation . Integrin - RGD complexes are central to mechanical sensing of the microenvironment , and at the same time , they also function as traction points that are needed for cell movement 38 . The migration observed during cell spreading in P8 is cell - adhesion dependent but degradation independent , as the synthetic PIC gel cannot be degraded by proteases . We emphasize that the matrix remodeling and cell spreading / migration modes in Matrigel differ from the ones in PIC gels , as reflected by the changes in cellular morphology in the two materials ( Supplementary Movies M4 , M5 ) . In Matrigel , stem cells produce small non - directional protrusions , but no migration is observed in the first 24 h . We speculate that cells are still degrading the surrounding ECM to create extra space . In contrast to Matrigel , the PIC - based synthetic matrix allows ( bio ) chemical - independent remodeling , also termed physical remodeling 40 of ECM . The bicyclic peptides present in P8 allow the cell to induce fast physical remodeling of the matrix by applying contractile forces . We hypothesize that in P8 the bicyclic peptide may contribute to the formation of filopodia 41 , as α 5 β 1 is crucial for stem cell migration 42 , 43 . The clustering of peptides , caused by the bundling of PIC polymers into fibers during gelation , may also facilitate cell adhesion and further morphological responses 17 . Furthermore , the plasticity of PIC hydrogel enables protease - free cell spreading and even migration in a short time span 40 . Conclusions Collectively , our results show that this novel combination of a synthetic network with architecture and mechanical characteristics of naturally occurring biomaterials , together with strongly - binding cyclic peptides results in an artificial ECM with properties that are well beyond what is possible with biological materials . In one gel , we observe tremendous acceleration in cell spreading , which , to our knowledge , has not been observed in any synthetic or biological matrix . Additionally , the results illustrate the importance to target specific integrin subunits using cell - adhesion peptides when designing biomaterials . Although in this work , we only vary the cell - adhesive peptide , the conjugation approach allows for the introduction of a broad variety of active biomolecules . Using this strategy , such synthetic ECMs can be modified to achieve specific properties , which opens the possibility to study cells in uniquely predefined 3D environments . For instance , stem cell migration , matrix remodeling , focal adhesion , and mechanotransduction pathways may be modeled . From a longer - term perspective , our system has the potential to be a powerful tool to manipulate stem cell behavior and be used for more tissue engineering purposes that target specific cell types . Materials and methods Polymer synthesis Polyisocyanides were synthesized using an established protocol as reported previously 19 . In short , the isocyanide monomers ( azide - appended monomer and non - functional monomer in ratio 1 : 29 ) were dissolved in freshly distilled toluene . A catalyst solution Ni ( ClO 4 ) 2 ·6H 2 O ( 0 . 1 mg mL – 1 ) in freshly distilled toluene / absolute ethanol 9 : 1 ) was added such that the total concentration monomer to Ni 2 + ratio equaled 5000 : 1 . Then toluene was added to adjust the final isocyanide concentration to 50 mg mL – 1 . The polymerization mixture was stirred at room temperature , and the progress of the reaction was followed by – 8 – IR - ATR ( disappearance of the characteristic isocyanide absorption at 2140 cm – 1 ) . Once the isocyanide was consumed ( 48 h ) , the polymer was precipitated in diisopropyl ether under vigorous stirring and collected by centrifugation . The polymer was dissolved in dichloromethane , precipitated for another two rounds , and air - dried to yield the polymers as off - white solids . The molecular weight of the polymer was determined by viscometry ( from dilute solutions in acetonitrile 0 . 1 - 0 . 6 mg mL – 1 ) using the empirical Mark – Houwink equation [ η ] = KM v a , where [ η ] is the experimentally determined intrinsic viscosity , M v is the viscosity - based molecular weight . We use values of the Mark – Houwink constants K and a that were previously determined for other polyisocyanides : K = 1 . 4 × 10 – 9 and a = 1 . 75 . For the polymer used in this study , we found M v = 536 kg mol – 1 . Bioconjugation The azide - appended polymer was dissolved in acetonitrile ( 2 . 5 mg mL – 1 ) , and the appropriate amount of the BCN – peptide ( PEPSCAN , 6 mg mL – 1 solution in DMSO , 0 . 33 eq . with respect to N 3 groups ) was added . The solution was stirred for 24 h at room temperature and the polymer – peptide conjugates were precipitated in diisopropyl ether , then collected by centrifugation and air - dried for 24 h . Rheology The mechanical analysis of the gels was performed according to a previously reported protocol 19 . Briefly , a stress - controlled rheometer ( Discovery HR - 1 or HR - 2 , TA Instruments ) with an aluminum or steel parallel plate geometry was used ( diameter = 40 mm , gap = 500 μm ) . All samples were loaded onto the rheometer plate in the liquid state at T = 5 °C followed by a temperature ramp to T = 37 °C at a rate of 1 . 0 °C min – 1 . The moduli were measured in the linear viscoelastic regime at an amplitude of γ = 0 . 02 or 0 . 04 and a frequency of ω = 1 . 0 Hz . The sample was allowed to equilibrate at 37 °C before the nonlinear measurements . Here , the gel was subjected to a constant prestress of σ 0 = 0 . 5 to 200 Pa , and the differential modulus K′ was probed with a small superposed oscillatory stress at frequencies of ω = 10 to 0 . 1 Hz ( reported data at ω = 1 Hz ) . The oscillatory stress was at least 10 times smaller than the applied prestress . Cell culture and encapsulation Human adipose - derived stem cells ( hASCs , passage p < = 6 ) were obtained from the Radboud Biobank and cultured in Minimum Essential Medium Eagle ( α - MEM ) ( Invitrogen , Thermo Fisher , USA ) . All media were supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( Sigma - Aldrich , USA ) and 1 % penicillin / streptomycin ( final concentration of 100 IU mL – 1 penicillin and 100 μg mL −1 streptomycin , Gibco , Thermo Fisher , USA ) . Dry PIC polymers were sterilized by UV for 10 min and then dissolved in the medium for 24 h at 4 °C . Cells were harvested by trypsin treatment once they reached 100 % confluence and were resuspended in fresh medium . After counting , cells were mixed with the polymer solution on ice in a pre - determined ratio to achieve the required cell density and polymer concentration . After mixing , the solutions were transferred to 48 - well plates ( Corning , USA ) , 8 - well chambered cover slides ( Sigma - Aldrich , USA ) or µ - Slide Angiogenesis ( IBIDI , Germany ) , and heated to 37 °C . After gel formation , warm culture medium was added onto the samples . Then all samples were subject to standard cell culture conditions ( humidified atmosphere , 37 °C , 5 % CO 2 ) . Matrigel experiments For the Matrigel experiment , Corning® Matrigel® Growth Factor Reduced ( GFR ) Basement Membrane Matrix ( Phenol red - free , LDEV - free ) was used . Briefly , the Matrigel solution and cell solution were mixed – 9 – in a 7 : 3 volume ratio on ice . The samples were incubated at 37 °C for 30 minutes before adding supernatant medium ( α - MEM ) on top . LIVE / DEAD assay The staining protocol was adapted from the product manual ( Invitrogen , Thermo Fisher , USA ) . In brief , first , cell culture medium on top of the gels was gently removed . Next , a 2 μM calcein AM and 4 μM EthD - 1 working solution was prepared in warm α - MEM medium and added onto gel samples . After a 30 - minute incubation in the cell incubator , all samples were washed by warm phosphate - buffed saline ( PBS ) and imaged by an Olympus FV - 1000 confocal fluorescence microscope . Cytoskeleton staining Gels with encapsulated cells were washed with PBS and then fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) in PBS for 40 min . After fixation , the samples were permeabilized with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 in PBS for 10 min and blocked with 1 % BSA in PBS for 30 min . They were then incubated with Phalloidin Atto - 520 ( 10 μM , 1 : 20 in 1 % BSA / PBS , Sigma - Aldrich , USA ) for 1 h . All procedures were performed at 37 °C . Fluorescence images were acquired on a Leica TCS SP8 X confocal microscope , using a water objective ( HC PL APO 20  / 0 . 75 , Leica and Fluotar VISIR 25  / 0 . 95 , Leica ) . For detection , we used a field - of - view scanner ( 400 Hz , bidirectional ) and a hybrid photomultiplier detector ( HYD - SMD , Leica ) . As the excitation source , a supercontinuum White Light Laser ( 470 – 670 nm , pulsed , 80 MHz , NKT Photonics ) was used . The phalloidin Atto - 520 was excited at 520 nm and fluorescence was collected between 530 nm and 670 nm . Images were acquired over a range of 500 µm in the z - direction . During measurements , the temperature was kept at 37 °C . The maximum projection images were prepared by compressing all the frames into one z projection using the FIJI software . YAP Immunostaining Samples were gently washed with warm PBS and fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS for 1 h at 37 °C . Next , the samples were washed with warm PBS and permeabilized with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 in PBS for 30 min at 37 °C . Subsequently , the samples were washed with warm PBS and blocked with 1 % BSA in PBS for 24 h at 37°C . Thereafter , the samples were incubated in primary antibody ( YAP Antibody ( 63 . 7 ) : sc - 101199 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology , USA ) 1 : 200 in 1 % BSA / PBS for 24 h at 37 °C and washed with warm PBS , then in secondary antibody ( Goat anti - Mouse IgG ( H + L ) Highly Cross - Adsorbed Secondary Antibody , Alexa Fluor 633 , Invitrogen , USA ) 1 : 200 in PBS for 4 h at 37 °C . All samples were counterstained with DAPI ( 2 . 5 μg mL −1 in PBS ) and washed with warm PBS . Fluorescence images were acquired on a Leica TCS SP8 X confocal microscope , using a water objective ( HC PL APO 63  / 1 . 20 , motCORR , Leica ) , a hybrid photomultiplier tube as the detector ( HYD - SMD , Leica ) and a field - of - view scanner ( 200 Hz , bidirectional ) . As excitation sources , a supercontinuum White Light Laser ( 470 – 670 nm , pulsed , 80 MHz , NKT Photonics ) was used for the Alexa Fluor 633 secondary antibody label and a UV diode laser ( 405 nm , pulsed , 40 MHz , PicoQuant ) was used for DAPI . The Alexa Fluor 633 was excited at 632 nm and fluorescence was collected between 639 nm and 773 nm . DAPI was excited at 405 nm and fluorescence was collected between 410 nm and 551 nm . Transmission light detection was done in a separate channel using a standard Photomultiplier tube ( Leica ) . All measurements were performed in a temperature - controlled environment ( 37 °C ) . Live cell imaging – 10 – A Cytosmart Lux 2 inverted bright - field microscope was placed in an incubator ( 37 °C , humidified ) to monitor the morphology of the cells in hydrogels . Cold cell - gel mixtures ( 100 µL ) were pipetted in a 35 mm glass - bottom dish ( Cellvis , # 1 . 5 ) and allowed to gelate at 37°C for 15 min . Afterward , 3 mL of CO 2 - independent α‐MEM culture medium ( Thermo Fisher ) was pipetted on top of the samples . 24 - hour monitoring was performed to acquire real - time videos with a 10  air objective . Images were acquired every 10 minutes . Morphology analysis FIJI was used for analysis , images were automatically preprocessed ( script 1 , Supplementary information ) and randomly selected cell segments were measured for morphological features ( script 2 , Supplementary information ) . A median filter was applied to the images to reduce the noise in the image while least affecting the form of the imaged cells . The filter size was chosen as small as possible to retain morphological detail , but large enough to enable a good segmentation result for the cells . One representative video per condition was used for analysis . Cell number per condition n = 20 , except : P0 at 1 hr ( n = 19 ) ; P4 at 1 hr ( n = 14 ) , at 3 hr ( n = 17 ) , at 5 hr ( n = 19 ) and at 24 hr ( n = 14 ) . One - way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) with Tuckey tests was performed for comparison between different conditions using Origin 2020 .
