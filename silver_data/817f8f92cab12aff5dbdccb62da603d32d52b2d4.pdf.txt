Although once thought to be present 18 only in animals , recent genome sequencing has revealed components of these pathways in the 19 closest unicellular relatives of animals . These findings raise questions about the ancestral 20 functions of these developmental pathways and their potential role in the emergence of animal 21 multicellularity . Here , we provide the first functional characterization of any of these 22 developmental pathways in unicellular organisms by developing techniques for genetic 23 manipulation in Capsaspora owczarzaki , a close unicellular relative of animals that displays 24 aggregative multicellularity . We then use these tools to characterize the Capsaspora ortholog of 25 the Hippo signaling nuclear effector YAP / TAZ / Yorkie ( coYki ) , a key regulator of tissue size in 26 animals . In contrast to what might be expected based on studies in animals , we show that coYki 27 is dispensable for cell proliferation but regulates cytoskeletal dynamics and the three - dimensional 28 ( 3D ) shape of multicellular structures . We further demonstrate that the cytoskeletal abnormalities 29 of individual coYki mutant cells underlie the abnormal 3D shape of coYki mutant aggregates . 30 Taken together , these findings implicate an ancestral role for the Hippo pathway in cytoskeletal 31 dynamics and multicellular morphogenesis predating the origin of animal multicellularity , which 32 was co - opted during evolution to regulate cell proliferation . 33 34 INTRODUCTION 35 The vast morphological diversity observed in animals is generated by developmental programs 36 mediated by a surprisingly small set of conserved signaling pathways ( Pires - daSilva and Sommer , 37 2003 ) . An exciting and unexpected finding from comparative genomic analysis indicates that 38 many components of these pathways are present in the closest unicellular relatives of animals 39 ( King et al . , 2003 ; Ros - Rocher et al . , 2021 ) . This raises the question of whether these pathways 40 show similar functions in animals and their unicellular relatives , and , if not , what the ancestral 41 3 functions of these pathways were , and how they evolved to function in multicellular processes in 42 animals . Answering this question could illuminate the roots of animal multicellularity and provide 43 novel perspective on how to manipulate the activity of these biomedically important pathways . 44 45 One such signaling pathway is the Hippo pathway , which coordinates cell proliferation , 46 differentiation , and survival in animals . Initially defined as a tumor suppressor pathway that 47 restricts tissue growth in Drosophila development , Hippo signaling plays a conserved role in organ 48 size control and regeneration in mammals ( Davis and Tapon , 2019 ; Harvey and Hariharan , 2012 ; 49 Moya and Halder , 2018 ; Yu et al . , 2015 ; Zheng and Pan , 2019 ) . This pathway comprises a core 50 kinase cascade involving sequential activation of two kinases , Hpo / MST and Wts / LATS , which 51 culminates in the phosphorylation and inactivation of the potent growth - stimulatory transcriptional 52 coactivator YAP / TAZ / Yorkie . This core kinase cascade is in turn regulated by diverse upstream 53 inputs , most notably mechanical force , the state of the actin cytoskeleton , and cell - cell or cell - 54 substrate adhesion as part of a mechanotransduction pathway that relays mechanical and 55 architectural cues to gene expression . Echoing its pervasive function in metazoan growth control , 56 the Hippo pathway is required for contact - inhibition of proliferation in cultured mammalian cells , 57 and defective Hippo signaling leading to YAP / TAZ oncogene activation is a major driver of human 58 cancers ( Davis and Tapon , 2019 ; Harvey and Hariharan , 2012 ; Moya and Halder , 2018 ; Yu et al . , 59 2015 ; Zheng and Pan , 2019 ) . 60 61 The Hippo pathway was at one point thought to be specific to animals . However , genome 62 sequencing efforts have revealed that a core Hippo pathway and many upstream regulators are 63 encoded in the genomes of the closest unicellular relatives of animals such as choanoflagellates 64 and filasterians ( Figure 1A ) ( Sebe - Pedros et al . , 2012 ) . The choanoflagellates are flagellated filter 65 feeders that can form multicellular rosette structures by incomplete cytokinesis ( Fairclough et al . , 66 2010 ) , whereas filasterians are amoeboid organisms characterized by actin - rich filopodial 67 4 projections ( Figure 1 , B and C ) and represent the most basal known unicellular organism 68 encoding all core components of the Hippo pathway , including upstream kinases and downstream 69 transcriptional machinery ( Sebe - Pedros et al . , 2012 ) . Capsaspora owczarzaki is a filasterean 70 originally isolated as a putative endosymbiont in the freshwater snail B . glabrata that can attack 71 and kill the parasitic schistosome S . mansoni ( Stibbs et al . , 1979 ) . Capsaspora can be cultured 72 easily in axenic growth medium containing protein source and serum in adherent or shaking 73 culture and can be transiently transfected , allowing for the examination of protein localization 74 using fluorescent fusion proteins ( Parra - Acero et al . , 2018 ) . Although Capsaspora tends to grow 75 as a unicellular organism in laboratory culture conditions , under certain conditions Capsaspora 76 cells can adhere to each other to form multicellular aggregates ( Figure 1 , D to F and Figure S1 , 77 ( Sebe - Pedros et al . , 2013 ) ) , suggesting that multicellular behaviors may have been selected for 78 in the lineage leading to Capsaspora . Previously , we have shown that overexpression of 79 Capsaspora Hippo pathway components such as coYki and coHpo in Drosophila elicits similar 80 phenotypes as their Drosophila orthologs ( Sebe - Pedros et al . , 2012 ) , suggesting that a functional 81 Hippo signaling pathway may have evolved well before the emergence of Metazoa . The 82 Capsaspora genome also encodes homologues of other key regulators of animal development 83 such as components of the integrin adhesome ( Sebe - Pedros et al . , 2010 ) , cadherins ( Nichols et 84 al . , 2012 ) , tyrosine kinases such as Src and Abl ( Suga et al . , 2012 ) , NF - kB ( Williams and Gilmore , 85 2020 ) and p53 ( Sebe - Pedros et al . , 2017 ) . Thus , Capsaspora offers a unique opportunity to 86 elucidate the ancestral function of these important developmental regulators in a close unicellular 87 relative of animals . 88 89 RESULTS 90 91 Development of genome editing tools in Capsaspora owczarzaki enables genetic 92 disruption of a YAP / TAZ / Yorkie ortholog 93 5 In an effort to make Capsaspora a tractable system for evolutionary cell biology studies , we 94 developed genetic tools for overexpression and loss - of - function analysis . We first established a 95 method for engineering stable Capsaspora cell lines by transfecting a vector encoding the 96 fluorescent protein mScarlet and resistance to the antibiotic Geneticin ( GenR ) . After transfection , 97 antibiotic selection , and generation of clonal lines by serial dilution , we were able to generate 98 uniformly mScarlet - positive clonal populations of cells ( Figure S2A ) . T ransfection of Capsaspora 99 with genes encoding resistance to nourseothricin ( NatR ) or hygromycin ( HygR ) followed by 100 selection with the respective antibiotic could also generate drug - resistant transformants ( Figure 101 S2B ) . These results demonstrate that stable Capsaspora cell lines expressing multiple 102 transgenes can be generated . 103 104 We next sought to develop tools for loss - of - function analysis in Capsaspora . After unsuccessful 105 attempts at CRISPR - Cas9 - mediated genome editing , which may be due to the lack of 106 nonhomologous end joining machinery components in Capsaspora , we used PCR - generated 107 targeting constructs to achieve gene disruption by homologous recombination , replacing each 108 allele of a diploid Capsaspora gene with a distinct selectable antibiotic marker ( Figure 1G ) . This 109 strategy allowed us to generate a cell line in which both coYki alleles were disrupted ( Figure S2 110 C - E ) , with no detectable expression of the deleted region of coYki ( Figure 1 , H to J ) . These results 111 demonstrate the generation of a homozygous coYki disruption mutant ( subsequently coYki - / - ) 112 and establish a method for the generation of mutants by gene targeting in Capsaspora . 113 114 coYki is dispensable for cell proliferation but regulates the 3D shape of multicellular 115 structures 116 To determine the effect of coYki on cell proliferation , we examined the proliferation of Capsaspora 117 cells in adherent or shaking culture . In contrast to what may be expected based on previous 118 6 studies in animal cells , we observed no significant difference in cell proliferation between WT and 119 coYki - / - cells in either condition ( Figure S3 ) . We next sought to examine cell proliferation within 120 Capsaspora aggregates . Previously , aggregates have been generated by gentle shaking of cell 121 cultures ( Sebe - Pedros et al . , 2013 ) . To make aggregates more amenable to extended imaging in 122 situ , we developed a condition that induced robust aggregate formation by plating Capsaspora 123 cells in low - adherence wells ( Figure 1 , D to F ) . Under this condition , most cells coalesced into 124 aggregates over 2 - 3 days , leaving few isolated cells in the culture . Treatment with the calcium 125 chelator EGTA resulted in rapid dissociation of the aggregates ( Figure S1 ) , suggesting that 126 calcium - dependent cell adhesion mediates aggregate integrity . We used EdU incorporation to 127 label proliferating cells in aggregates , and observed no significant difference in the percent of 128 EdU - positive cells between WT and coYki - / - genotypes ( Figure 2 , A and B ) . U nlike clones of 129 cultured mammalian cells that often display increased cell proliferation at the clonal boundary 130 ( Fisher and Yeh , 1967 ) , distribution of EdU + cells was homogeneous within Capsaspora 131 aggregates ( Figure 2A ) , suggesting that a mechanism akin to contact - mediated inhibition of 132 proliferation is absent in Capsaspora . Together , these results suggest that the rate of proliferation 133 of Capsaspora is independent of coYki or contact inhibition . 134 135 While examining Capsaspora aggregates , we observed a profound phenotype in the shape of the 136 coYki - / - aggregates . After aggregate induction by plating cells in low - adherence conditions , WT 137 cell aggregates showed a round morphology ( Figure 2C ) . In contrast , coYki - / - aggregates were 138 asymmetric and less circular than WT aggregates ( Figure 2D ) . Computational analysis of 139 aggregate morphology and size revealed that WT and coYki - / - aggregate size was not 140 significantly different ( Figure 2E ) , whereas coYki - / - aggregates were significantly less circular 141 than WT aggregates ( Figure 2F ) . Optical sectioning of aggregates expressing mScarlet showed 142 that WT aggregates were thicker perpendicular to the culture surface and more spherical than 143 7 coYki - / - aggregates ( Figure 2G ) . Time - lapse microscopy of aggregation over a period of six days 144 showed that , whereas WT cells accreted into round aggregates that fused with other aggregates 145 when in close proximity but never underwent fission , coYki - / - aggregates were dynamically 146 asymmetrical , less circular than WT , and sometimes underwent fission ( Video S1 ) . Taken 147 together , these findings uncover a critical role for coYki in 3 - dimensional ( 3D ) shape of 148 aggregates , but not cell proliferation , in Capsaspora . 149 150 Loss of coYki affects cell - substrate adhesion but not cell - cell adhesion 151 Cell - cell adhesion and cell - substrate adhesion affect 3D shape of tumor cell aggregates ( Blandin 152 et al . , 2016 ; Saias et al . , 2015 ) . We therefore tested whether cell - cell adhesion and cell - substrate 153 adhesion differ in WT and coYki - / - cells . A prediction of differential cell - cell adhesion is that 154 mosaic aggregates of WT and coYki - / - cells may show cell sorting within aggregates ( Foty and 155 Steinberg , 2005 ) . To test this prediction , we induced aggregate formation after mixing mCherry - 156 labeled WT or coYki - / - cells with unlabeled WT cells at 1 : 9 ratio . The distribution of mCherry - 157 labeled WT or coYki - / - cells within such mixed aggregates was similar and no cell sorting was 158 evident ( Figure 3 , A to D ) , indicating that individual coYki - / - cells are competent to adhere to and 159 integrate within aggregates and suggesting that the aberrant morphology of coYki - / - aggregates 160 is an emergent property of a large number of coYki - / - cells . 161 162 To further test whether cell - cell adhesion differs in WT and coYki - / - cells , we vigorously vortexed 163 Capsaspora cultures to separate individual cells , allowed cell clusters to form by cell - cell adhesion 164 under gentle rotation , and then counted the number of cells in each cluster . The number of cells 165 per cluster was similar for WT and coYki - / - cells ( Figure 3E ) , suggesting that the occurrence of 166 cell - cell adhesion is similar in these genotypes . We next tested whether cell - substrate adhesion 167 differed in WT and coYki - / - cells by agitating cultures of adherent cells and counting the number 168 of cells that disassociate from the culture surface . After agitation , significantly more coYki - / - cells 169 8 remained attached to the culture surface compared to WT cells ( Figure 3F ) , indicating that coYki 170 negatively regulates cell - substrate adhesion . Together , our data suggest that coYki affects the 171 morphology of cell aggregates by affecting cell - substrate adhesion but not cell - cell adhesion . 172 173 coYki - / - cells show aberrant cytoskeletal dynamics and bleb - like protrusions 174 To characterize properties of coYki - / - cells that may contribute to abnormal aggregate 175 morphology , we used time - lapse microscopy to examine the dynamic morphology of individual 176 WT and coYki - / - cells in adherent culture . Interestingly , the cortices of coYki - / - cells were much 177 more dynamic than those of WT cells . Whereas coYki - / - cells display extensive membrane 178 protrusions and retractions , such dynamic membrane structures were rarely observed in WT cells 179 ( Video S2 ) . To characterize the differences in cell membrane dynamics , we quantified the 180 occurrence of cell protrusions in WT cells , coYki - / - cells , and coYki - / - cells expressing a coYki 181 rescue transgene . WT cells rarely showed protrusions . In contrast , coYki - / - cells showed an 182 average of 3 . 1 protrusions per minute ( Figure 4A ) , a phenotype that was rescued in coYki - / - cells 183 expressing a coYki transgene ( Figure 4A , Video S3 ) . These results suggest that coYki affects the 184 cortical dynamics of Capsaspora cells . 185 186 In principle , the extensive membrane protrusions made by coYki - / - cells may represent F - actin - 187 rich pseudopodia , which drive amoeboid motility , or , alternatively , F - actin - poor blebs , which are 188 actin - depleted extensions of plasma membrane generated by disassociation of the membrane 189 from the cell cortex or cortical rupture ( Charras and Paluch , 2008 ) . To distinguish between these 190 possibilities , we stably expressed a fusion protein of the F - actin - binding Lifeact peptide ( Riedl et 191 al . , 2008 ) with mScarlet in WT and coYki - / - cells and examined F - actin dynamics by time - lapse 192 microscopy . At the basal side of WT cells , Lifeact - mScarlet was often enriched at the cell edge 193 corresponding to the direction of cell movement , suggesting that Capsaspora undergoes F - actin - 194 mediated amoeboid locomotion ( Video S4 ) . As cells move , some Lifeact - mScarlet signal appears 195 9 as stationary foci on the basal surface , suggesting the existence of actin - rich structures that 196 mediate cell - substrate interaction in Capsaspora ( Figure 4B , Video S4 ) . Optical sections at mid - 197 height of WT cells showed that F - actin was enriched at a circular cell cortex , where transient 198 bursts of small F - actin puncta were often observed ( Figure 4B , Video S5 ) . In contrast , cortical 199 shape was less circular in coYki - / - cells , and F - actin concentration along the cortex was less 200 uniform ( Figure 4B ) . During the formation of the membrane protrusions produced by coYki - / - 201 cells , F - actin was initially depleted as compared to the rest of the cell ( Figure 4C , Video S6 ) . After 202 the membrane protrusions had fully extended , F - actin accumulated first at the distal end and then 203 along the entire cortex of the protrusion , followed by the regression of the protrusion . A similar 204 sequence of cytoskeletal events occurs in blebbing mammalian cells ( Charras et al . , 2006 ) . These 205 results suggest that the protrusions observed in coYki - / - cells are actin - depleted blebs , and that 206 after bleb formation , F - actin re - accumulates within the bleb leading to cortical reformation and 207 bleb regression . 208 209 To determine whether the abnormal cortical cytoskeleton is specific to coYki - / - cells in adherent 210 culture , we examined coYki - / - cells within aggregates by time - lapse microscopy . Lifeact - 211 mScarlet - expressing cells were mixed with cells stably expressing the green fluorescent protein 212 Venus so that Lifeact - mScarlet - expressing cells were well - spaced and able to be imaged 213 individually . As in adherent cells , coYki - / - cells within aggregates showed dynamic formation of 214 actin - depleted blebs ( Video S7 ) . Thus , coYki - / - cells show aberrant cortical cytoskeleton and 215 excessive membrane blebbing in both isolated adherent cells and within aggregates . 216 217 Treatment of coYki - / - cells with blebbistatin rescues both membrane blebbing and 218 aberrant shape of multicellular aggregates 219 Loss of coYki causes both bleb - like protrusions and abnormal aggregate morphology , suggesting 220 that the cellular phenotypes observed in coYki - / - cells ( membrane blebbing and related cortical 221 10 cytoskeletal defects ) may underlie the aberrant aggregate morphology . We tested this hypothesis 222 by treating coYki - / - cells with Blebbistatin , a myosin II inhibitor named after its bleb - inhibiting 223 activity in mammalian cells ( Straight et al . , 2003 ) . Strikingly , not only did low concentrations of 224 Blebbistatin suppress the formation of blebs in coYki - / - cells ( Figure 4D , Video S8 ) , Blebbistatin 225 also rescued the abnormal morphology of coYki - / - aggregates ( Figure 4E ) . Whereas coYki - / - 226 cell aggregates were asymmetric and showed low circularity ( Figure 4E’’’ ) , coYki - / - aggregates 227 treated with blebbistatin were circular and resembled WT aggregates ( Figure 4E’’’’ and 4F ) . These 228 results suggest a causal link between the membrane / cytoskeletal defects observed in individual 229 coYki - / - cells and the abnormal morphology of coYki - / - aggregates . 230 231 Gene expression changes in coYki - / - cells support a role for coYki in cytoskeletal 232 functions 233 To characterize the transcriptional targets of coYki that may underlie the 234 morphological / cytoskeletal defects of coYki - / - cells , we performed RNAseq on WT and coYki - / - 235 cells in adherent culture . This analysis revealed 1205 differentially expressed genes , including 236 397 downregulated and 808 upregulated genes in the coYki mutant . Functional enrichment 237 analysis of these two gene sets revealed distinct enrichment of functional categories ( Figure 5 , A 238 and B ) . Genes predicted to encode actin - binding proteins were enriched in the set of genes 239 upregulated in the coYki - / - mutant , suggesting that these genes may play a role in the aberrant 240 cytoskeletal dynamics observed in coYki - / - cells . To further inquire into the potential function of 241 coYki - regulated genes , we searched the 1205 differentially expressed genes against a previously 242 reported Capsaspora phylome ( Sebe - Pedros et al . , 2016 ) to identify 638 Capsaspora genes with 243 predicted human or mouse orthologs . Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of this mammalian ortholog set 244 showed that the two most significantly enriched functional categories corresponded to cell 245 movement and cell migration ( Figure 5C ) . Notably , regulation of cell migration was reported as 246 the most enriched functional category among YAP target genes in glioblastoma cells ( Stein et al . , 247 11 2015 ) , and cell motility was an enriched category in an integrative analysis of gene regulatory 248 networks downstream of YAP / TAZ utilizing transcriptomic and cistromic data from multiple human 249 tissues ( Paczkowska et al . , 2020 ) . However , in contrast to functional enrichment studies in 250 metazoan systems examining genes regulated by YAP / TAZ / Yorkie ( Ikmi et al . , 2014 ; Stein et al . , 251 2015 ; Zanconato et al . , 2015 ) , no enrichment was detected in functional categories of cell 252 proliferation or the cell cycle ( Figure 5C ) . This finding is consistent with the lack of a proliferative 253 phenotype in coYki - / - cells . 254 255 DISCUSSION 256 257 Given that all current biological phenomena are the product of a long and complex evolutionary 258 process , understanding the evolutionary history of biological systems , such as signaling 259 pathways , can give important insight into their current properties and functions . The presence of 260 complete core Hippo pathway components in the close unicellular relatives of animals ( Sebe - 261 Pedros et al . , 2012 ) provides the opportunity to elucidate the premetazoan function and 262 evolutionary history of this pathway . By developing tools for genome editing in Capsaspora , we 263 demonstrate that coYki regulates cytoskeletal dynamics at the cell cortex but is dispensable for 264 the proliferation of Capsaspora cells . Such coYki - dependent cortical cytoskeletal function , in turn , 265 regulates the 3D shape of Capsaspora aggregates in a manner that may involve tuning the 266 strength of cell - substrate adhesion . Investigating the Hippo pathway in other unicellular relatives 267 of animals such as choanoflagellates and ichthyosporeans , which are now amenable to 268 transgenic studies ( Booth and King , 2020 ; Booth et al . , 2018 ; Suga and Ruiz - Trillo , 2013 ) , will 269 further clarify the ancestral function of this pathway predating the emergence of animal 270 multicellularity . 271 272 12 Our findings implicate cytoskeletal regulation as an ancestral function of the Hippo pathway 273 predating the origin of Metazoa , and that this pathway was later co - opted to control cell 274 proliferation after the unicellular - to - multicellular transition in the lineage leading to animals . This 275 co - option likely occurred early in the animal lineage , as in early - diverging ctenophores and 276 cnidarians Hippo pathway activity is enriched in proliferating tissues ( Coste et al . , 2016 ) . Given 277 that the cortical cytoskeleton is both an important upstream regulator and a downstream effector 278 of Hippo signaling in animal cells ( Deng et al . , 2020 ; Fernandez et al . , 2011 ; Gaspar and Tapon , 279 2014 ; Sun and Irvine , 2016 ) , the co - option of the Hippo pathway for cell proliferation control in 280 early metazoans may have provided a convenient mechanism that couples cell proliferation with 281 cytoskeletal and mechanical properties of cells . 282 283 Our study suggests that the abnormal 3D shape of coYki - / - aggregates is due to increased cell - 284 substrate adhesion without affecting cell - cell adhesion . Capsaspora encodes an integrin 285 adhesome ( Sebe - Pedros et al . , 2010 ) , and Capsaspora cell - substrate adhesion is mediated at 286 least in part by integrins ( Parra - Acero et al . , 2020 ) . Indeed , our RNA - seq data shows that two 287 integrin - b genes ( CAOG _ 05058 and CAOG _ 01283 ) are upregulated in coYki - / - cells , suggesting 288 a potential contribution by integrins in this phenotype . Given that the strength of integrin - mediated 289 focal adhesions can be regulated by cytoskeletal contractility ( Dumbauld et al . , 2010 ) , the 290 aberrant cytoskeletal properties of coYki - / - cells may also contribute to their abnormal cell - 291 substrate adhesion . This possibility is consistent with our data showing that blebbistatin , which 292 inhibits myosin and thus perturbs cytoskeletal contractility , can rescue the aberrant morphology 293 of coYki - / - aggregates . 294 295 A dedicated role for coYki in regulating the 3D shape but not the size of Capsaspora aggregates 296 may reflect the different selection pressures on animals versus their close unicellular relatives . It 297 has been suggested that the emergence of multicellularity is driven by phagotrophic predators of 298 13 unicellular organisms , as multicellular aggregates are less likely to be consumed by phagotrophic 299 predators and thus are selectively favored ( Stanley , 1973 ) . A round aggregate shape ensures 300 maximum contact between cells within the group , reducing the chance of a cell disassociating 301 and thus being vulnerable to predation . Interestingly , a YAP loss - of - function mutation in medaka 302 fish causes a tissue flattening phenotype ( Porazinski et al . , 2015 ) similar to that observed in coYki 303 - / - Capsaspora aggregates ( Figure 5D ) . This suggests that the regulation of 3D tissue architecture 304 is an ancient and conserved function of YAP / TAZ / Yorkie predating the origin of animal 305 multicellularity . We suggest that YAP / TAZ / Yorkie may have first been selected during evolution 306 to regulate the 3D shape of multicellular aggregates in unicellular ancestors of animals , and 307 evolved later to also control organ size in order to maintain appropriate scaling between the size 308 of an organ and the size of the body as a whole . 309 310 Besides implicating an ancestral function of the Hippo pathway in pre - metazoan multicellular 311 morphogenesis , the genetic tools we have developed for modifying the Capsaspora genome 312 provide a valuable opportunity to interrogate the premetazoan functions of other developmental 313 regulators that are present in the genomes of close unicellular relatives of animals . Future 314 functional studies in Capsaspora and other close unicellular relatives of animals should clarify the 315 evolutionary history of these important signaling pathways and further elucidate the nature of the 316 unicellular ancestor of animals and the emergence of animal multicellularity . 317 318 319 14 METHODS 320 321 Cell culture 322 Capsaspora cells were maintained in ATCC Medium 1034 ( modified PYNFH medium ) 323 supplemented with 25 μg / mL Ampicillin ( referred to below as “growth medium” ) in a 23°C 324 incubator . Cells were kept in either 25 cm 2 cell culture flasks in 8 mL medium or in 75 cm 2 cell 325 culture flasks in 15 ml medium . To induce cell aggregation , cells were resuspended to 7 . 5 x 10 5 326 cells / ml in growth medium , and 1 ml of this cell suspension was added per well to a 24 - well ultra - 327 low attachment plate ( Sigma CLS3473 ) . To test the effect of blebbistatin on aggregate 328 morphology , a 20 mM stock solution of blebbistatin ( Sigma B0560 ) in DMSO was made , and cells 329 were resuspended to 7 . 5 x 10 5 cells / ml in growth medium with 1 μm blebbistatin or DMSO only 330 as a vehicle control . Aggregates were then generated as described above and imaged with a 331 Nikon Eclipse Ti inverted microscope with NIS - Elements acquisition software . 332 333 To characterize cell proliferation during growth on a solid substrate , Capsaspora cells were diluted 334 to 1 x 10 5 cells / ml in growth medium , and 800 μl of this dilution was pipetted into multiple wells in 335 a 24 - well polystyrene cell culture plate . To prevent edge effects , wells at the edge of the plate 336 were not used and were instead filled with 800 μl of water . The plates were then kept in in a 23°C 337 incubator . Each day , 1 . 5 μl of a 500 mM EDTA solution was added to a well , and cells in the well 338 were resuspended by pipetting up and down for one minute . Resuspended cells were then 339 transferred to a 1 . 5 mL tube , vortexed , and then the cell density was determined by 340 hemocytometer . To characterize cell proliferation in shaking culture , cells were diluted to 1 x 10 5 341 cells / ml in growth medium , and 20 ml of this dilution was added to a 125 ml Erlenmeyer culture 342 flask . Cultures were then incubated in an orbital shaker at 150 rpm and 23°C . Cell density was 343 determined daily by transferring 200 μl of culture to a 1 . 5 ml tube , adding 1 . 5 μl of 500 mM EDTA 344 solution to disassociate any aggregated cells , vortexing , and counting by hemocytometer . 345 15 346 Fixation and staining of aggregates 347 To fix and stain aggregates , aggregates were generated as described above , and then 348 aggregates were collected from a 24 - well plate by gentle pipetting . 500 μl of aggregate 349 suspension was added dropwise to 9 ml of PM PFA ( 100 mM PIPES ph 6 . 9 , 0 . 1 mM MgSO 4 , 4 % 350 PFA filtered through a 0 . 45 μm syringe filter ) in a 15 mL polystyrene tube , and tubes were left 351 undisturbed for 1 hour to allow fixation . Aggregates were then centrifuged at 1000 x g for 3 352 minutes and resuspended in 500 μl of PEM buffer ( 100 mM PIPES pH 6 . 9 , 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 1 mM 353 MgSO 4 ) . After transferring aggregates to a microcentrifuge tube , aggregates were centrifuged for 354 2000 x g for 2 minutes , the supernatant was removed , and aggregates were resuspended in 300 355 μl of PEM . 356 357 As we found that aggregates were fragile during continued centrifugation - resuspension cycles , 358 we developed a protocol where solution changes could be done without centrifugation using 24 - 359 well plate inserts with an 8 micron pore membrane at the insert base ( Corning 3422 ) . Before use 360 with aggregates , 100 μl PEM buffer was added to a well in a 24 - well plate , 300 μl of PEM was 361 added to a membrane insert , and the insert was placed in the well and allowed to drain ( contact 362 between the membrane and the solution within the well is critical for draining ) . Aggregates in 300 363 μl of PEM were added to the insert , and the insert was moved to a new well with 100 μl of PEM 364 and allowed to drain . As a wash step , the membrane insert was then moved to a well containing 365 1200 μl of PEM , allowing the membrane insert to fill with PEM buffer , and after a 5 minute 366 incubation , the membrane was moved to a new well with 100 μl of PEM and allowed to drain . The 367 membrane insert was then moved to a well containing 1200 μl of PEM block / permeabilization 368 solution ( 100 mM PIPES pH 6 . 9 , 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 1 mM MgSO 4 , 1 % BSA , 0 . 3 % Triton X - 100 ) and 369 incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature . The membrane insert was moved to a well with 370 100 μl of PEM and allowed to drain and then moved into a well containing 1 mL PEM with DAPI 371 16 ( 2 μg / mL ) and Phalloidin ( 0 . 1 μM ) and incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature . Aggregates 372 were then washed once more in 1200 μl PEM . To mount aggregates for imaging , the membrane 373 insert was placed in a new well with 100 μl of PEM buffer and was allowed to drain , aggregates 374 were resuspended in the residual buffer ( approximately 50 μl ) by gentle pipetting , and then 375 aggregates were pipetted onto a microscope slide and allowed to settle for 5 minutes . Kimwipes 376 were then placed in contact with the edge of the liquid on the slide , allowing for removal of excess 377 buffer by capillary action . 15 μl of Fluoromount G ( SouthernBiotech ) was pipetted onto the 378 aggregates , which were then covered with a 22 x 40 mm cover glass and sealed with nail polish . 379 Aggregates were subsequently imaged with a Zeiss LSM 880 confocal microscope . Staining of 380 adherent cells with phalloidin was done as previously described ( Parra - Acero et al . , 2020 ) . 381 382 EdU labeling of aggregates 383 To examine cell proliferation within aggregates by EdU labeling , aggregates were generated in 384 ultra - low adherence 24 - well plates as described above . 3 days after aggregation was initiated , 385 100 μl of growth medium containing EdU was added to aggregates to result in a 150 μM EdU 386 concentration . Aggregates were incubated with EdU for 4 hours and then fixed and resuspended 387 in 300 μl PEM buffer as described above . Aggregates were then processed for imaging following 388 the manufacturer’s protocol ( ThermoFisher C10339 ) using the 24 - well plate membrane insert 389 method described above to transfer aggregates between solutions . For all steps , wells with 1 mL 390 of solution were used for washing or staining cells in membrane inserts , and wells with 100 μl of 391 solution were used to drain wells in preparation for transfer into the next solution . 392 393 Molecular Biology 394 For the sequences of synthesized DNA fragments and oligonucleotides used in this study , see 395 Data S1 and S2 , respectively . For a list of plasmids generated for this study , see Data S3 . To 396 generate a vector for mScarlet expression in Capsaspora ( pJP71 ) , a DNA construct containing 397 17 an open reading frame encoding the mScarlet protein ( Bindels et al . , 2017 ) codon - optimized for 398 expression in Capsaspora and under control of the previously described EF1 - α promoter and 399 terminator from the pONSY - mCherry vector ( Parra - Acero et al . , 2018 ) was constructed by gene 400 synthesis ( sJP1 ) and cloned into the EcoRV site of the pUC57 - mini vector ( Genscript ) . A KpnI 401 site and an AflII site were incorporated at the beginning and end of the coding sequence , 402 respectively , allowing for the construction of N or C - terminal protein fusion constructs by Gibson 403 assembly . To generate a plasmid for expression of mScarlet and a Geneticin resistance gene 404 ( pJP72 ) , the NeoR coding sequence from the Dictyostelium pDM323 vector ( Veltman et al . , 2009 ) 405 was codon optimized for Capsaspora , the optimized sequence was synthesized with the promoter 406 and terminator from the Capsaspora actin ortholog gene CAOG _ 06018 , and the synthesized 407 fragment ( sJP2 ) was cloned into the SmaI site of pJP71 by Gibson assembly . To generate 408 plasmids expressing mScarlet and either nourseothricin resistance ( pJP102 ) or hygromycin 409 resistance ( pJP103 ) , an identical strategy to that used in constructing pJP72 was used , except 410 either a synthesized codon - optimized nourseothricin acetyltransferase gene ( sJP3 ) based on the 411 sequence of pUC18T - mini - Tn7T - nat ( Lehman et al . , 2016 ) or a synthesized codon - optimized 412 hygromycin B phosphotransferase gene ( sJP4 ) based on the sequence of Dictyostelium vector 413 pDM358 ( Veltman et al . , 2009 ) was used . 414 415 To generate a plasmid encoding coYki and Hygromycin resistance for rescue of coYki - / - 416 phenotypes ( pJP119 ) , a DNA fragment encoding coYki and a c - terminal OLLAS epitope tag ( Park 417 et al . , 2008 ) was generated by PCR from a synthesized a gene encoding the coYki protein ( sJP5 ) 418 using primers oJP101 and oJP102 . To limit recombination of the transgene with the endogenous 419 coYki loci , we recoded the coYki reading frame using synonymous codon replacement , resulting 420 in a coYki gene with 73 percent nucleotide similarity to the WT coYki gene but encoding an 421 identical polypeptide . This PCR product was then cloned into a KpnI and AflII digest of pJP103 422 using Gibson assembly . 423 18 424 To generate a plasmid encoding a Lifeact - mScarlet fusion protein and hygromycin resistance 425 ( pJP118 ) , a DNA fragment optimized for expression in Capsaspora encoding the Lifeact peptide 426 ( Riedl et al . , 2008 ) ( sJP6 ) was synthesized and cloned into the KpnI site of pJP103 by Gibson 427 assembly . To generate a plasmid expressing Venus and Geneticin resistance ( pJP114 ) , the 428 Venus reading frame was amplified from p EF1α - CoH2B : Venus ( Addgene # 111877 , ( Parra - Acero 429 et al . , 2018 ) ) using primers oJP103 and oJP104 and cloned into a KpnI and AflII digest of pJP72 430 by Gibson assembly . 431 432 Capsaspora Transfection 433 24 - well plates were prepared for transfection by inserting one sterile 12mm circular glass coverslip 434 in each well to aid in cell adhesion during transfection . Capsaspora cells at exponential growth 435 phase were collected by pipetting medium over attached cells , resuspended to 7 . 5 x 10 5 cells / ml 436 in growth medium , and then 800 μl of this cell culture was added per well to the prepared 24 - well 437 plate . Cells were incubated at 23°C overnight . The following day growth medium was removed 438 from cells and was replaced by 800 μl of transfection medium ( Scheider’s Drosophila Medium 439 ( ThermoFisher 21720024 ) with 10 % FBS ( ThermoFisher 26140079 ) supplemented with 25 μg / mL 440 Ampicillin ) . After a 10 - minute incubation at room temperature , transfection medium was removed 441 from the cells and replaced with 500 of fresh transfection medium . Transfection mixes were then 442 prepared : 100 μl of Opti - MEM I Reduced Serum Medium ( ThermoFisher ) was added to a 1 . 5ml 443 tube , and 1 μg of transfecting DNA was added to this medium ( for multiple plasmids , an equivalent 444 amount of each plasmid by mass was used ) . 3 μl of Trans IT - X2 ® transfection reagent ( Mirus Bio ) 445 was then added to the tube , and the solution was immediately mixed by pipetting up and down . 446 Transfection mixes were incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes , and then 70 μl of the 447 transfection mix was added dropwise to one well in the 24 - well plate . Cells were incubated at 448 23°C for 24 hours , and then the medium was removed and replaced with 800 μl of growth medium . 449 19 To image fluorescent transient transfectants , cells were then resuspended by pipetting up and 450 down , and 300 μl of resuspended cells in growth medium were transferred to a well of an 8 - well 451 chambered coverglass slide ( Nunc ) . Cells were then imaged 48 hours after addition of growth 452 medium using a Zeiss LSM 880 confocal microscope . 453 454 Stable expression of transgenes in clonal Capsaspora cell lines 455 Transforming plasmids were linearized by digestion with either ScaI - HF ® or AseI restriction 456 enzymes ( NEB ) , which cut within the ampicillin resistance gene , and then purified from solution 457 and resuspended in nuclease - free water . Capsaspora cells were transfected with the linearized 458 plasmids using the Trans IT - X2 ® transfection reagent as described above . Two days after growth 459 medium was added to cells following transfection , the growth medium was removed and replaced 460 with 800 μl of growth medium supplemented with selective drugs . Due to observations of 461 variability in cell viability between transfections , three drug concentrations were tested in parallel 462 for each transfection : for Geneticin ( ThermoFisher ) , cells were treated at 40 , 60 , or 80 μg / ml ; for 463 Nourseothricin ( GoldBio ) , cells were treated at 50 , 75 , or 100 μg / ml ; for Hygromycin B ( Sigma ) , 464 cells were treated at 150 , 200 , or 250 μg / ml . Cells were grown in selective medium for 2 weeks , 465 and medium was changed every 3 days . Following selection , clonal cell populations were 466 generated by resuspending cells in growth medium by pipetting , diluting cells to 3 cells / mL in 467 growth medium , and adding 100 μl of this dilution to 200 μl of growth medium per in a well in a 468 48 - well plate ( this procedure generated approximately 10 wells with cell growth for each 48 - well 469 plate ) . To image fluorescence in stably transfected lines , clonal cell populations were transferred 470 into wells in a 4 - well glass bottom chamber slide ( Nunc ) , incubated at 23°C for 24 hours , and cells 471 were then imaged using a Nikon Eclipse Ti inverted microscope with NIS - Elements acquisition 472 software . 473 474 Disruption of the Capsaspora coYki gene by gene targeting 475 20 To disrupt coYki , we attempted to delete a 228 bp segment of the coYki open reading frame that 476 encodes the predicted Tead - binding domain ( Sebe - Pedros et al . , 2012 ) using a PCR - generated 477 gene targeting construct . We designed a pair of primers that amplify the drug resistance markers 478 described above , including the actin ( CAOG _ 06018 ) promoter and terminator , with 90 bp of 479 homology adjacent to the sequence targeted for deletion at the 5’ end of the primers ( oJP105 and 480 oJP106 ) . These primers were used to amplify the Geneticin resistance cassette from pJP72 by 481 PCR , the resulting PCR product was gel purified and resuspended in nuclease - free water , and 482 WT Capsaspora cells were transfected with this DNA as described above . Clonal populations of 483 drug - resistant transformants were generated as described above , each clone was grown to 484 confluency in one well in a 24 - well plate , cells were collected by pipetting up and down , and 485 genomic DNA was prepared following the protocol described below . To genotype potential 486 mutants , we performed diagnostic PCRs on genomic DNA : to test for presence of the WT allele , 487 we used a forward primer with homology to the genome 5’ of the coYki sequence targeted for 488 deletion ( oJP107 ) and a reverse primer with homology within the sequence targeted for deletion 489 ( oJP108 ) . To detect successful deletion , we used oJP107 as a forward primer and a reverse 490 primer with homology to the geneticin resistance gene ( oJP109 ) . 40 percent of analyzed clones 491 ( 6 of 15 tested clones ) showed a PCR product indicative of disruption of the coYki allele ( Figure 492 S2D ) . However , all clones showed a band indicative of an intact WT coYki gene . We therefore 493 reasoned that , at least for the culture conditions used during transfection , Capsaspora cells may 494 be diploid . 495 496 After the isolation of clonal lines that were heterozygous for coYki disruption with the Geneticin 497 resistance marker as indicated by diagnostic PCR , we attempted to disrupt the remaining coYki 498 allele using nourseothricin resistance as a marker . pJP102 was used as a template for PCR using 499 primers oJP105 and oJP106 to generate a nourseothricin resistance cassette flanked by 500 homology arms targeting coYki for disruption . This construct was used to transfect a Geneticin - 501 21 resistant heterozygous coYki disruption mutant , and drug selection of transfectants was done as 502 described above using simultaneous selection with 60 μg / ml Geneticin and 75 μg / ml 503 nourseothricin . After generating clonal populations of drug - resistant transformants , diagnostic 504 PCR was done to detect the intact coYki allele as described above or a deletion allele containing 505 the nourseothricin resistance gene using primers oJP107 and oJP110 . Two cell lines that showed 506 absence of the WT coYki allele and presence of both disruption alleles encoding either Geneticin 507 or nourseothricin resistance were used for subsequent phenotypic studies . 508 509 To quantify coYki gene expression in a putative homozygous coYki disruption mutant ( coYki - / - ) 510 by qPCR , 5 x 10 6 WT or coYki - / - cells were collected from culture flasks while in growth medium 511 by pipetting up and down , and RNA was isolated using a RNeasy Mini Plus kit ( Qiagen ) . cDNA 512 was made using the iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit ( BioRad ) , qPCR reactions were made using iQ TM 513 SRBR â Green Supermix ( BioRad ) , and qPCR was performed using a CFX96 Touch Real - time 514 PCR detection system ( BioRad ) with the following primers : oJP111 and oJP112 to detect GAPDH , 515 oJP113 and oJP114 to detect a region of coYki within the sequence targeted for deletion , and 516 oJP115 and oJP116 to detect a region coYki 3’ of the sequence targeted for deletion . 517 518 Preparing Capsaspora genomic DNA 519 Capsaspora genomic DNA was prepared for PCR analysis following a procedure previously 520 developed for Dictyostelium discoideum ( Charette and Cosson , 2004 ) . Cells grown in a 24 - well 521 or 48 - well plate in growth medium were collected by pipetting up and down , pipetted into a 1 . 5 522 mL tube , centrifuged at 4000 x g for 5 minutes , and resuspended in 20 μl of nuclease - free water . 523 20 μl of Lysis buffer ( 50 mM KCl , 10 mM TRIS pH 8 . 3 , 2 . 5 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 45 % NP40 , 0 . 45 % Tween 524 20 , and 800 μg / ml Proteinase K added fresh from a 20 mg / ml stock ) was added to cells , which 525 were then incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes . Tubes were then placed at 95°C for 5 526 22 minutes . After cooling to room temperature , 1 μl of this sample was then used as a template in a 527 20 - μl diagnostic PCR . 528 529 Quantification of aggregate size and circularity 530 ImageJ was used to quantify aggregate size and circularity using aggregate images . Images were 531 converted to 8 - bit format , processed twice using the “Smooth” function , and a Threshold was 532 adjusted for each individual image . The Analyze Particles command was then run with a gate for 533 particle size at 400 - infinity micron 2 and the “exclude on edges” option selected . The returned 534 values for aggregate area and circularity were then used for further analysis . Values 535 corresponding to more than one adjacent aggregate interpreted by the algorithm as a single 536 particle were discarded . 537 538 Assaying cell - cell adhesion and cell - substrate adhesion 539 To examine cell - cell adhesion , cells were collected from a culture flask by pipetting growth media 540 over the culture surface , diluted to 1 x 10 6 cells / mL in growth medium , and vortexed to disrupt cell 541 clusters . 1 mL volumes of cell culture were then transferred to 1 . 5 mL tubes and incubated on a 542 Labquake TM rotator ( Thermo ) for one hour at room temperature . Cultures were then examined by 543 hemocytometer , and the number of cells in each cluster of cells was counted for at least 35 cell 544 clusters for each independent experiment . 545 546 To examine cell - substrate adhesion , cells were diluted to 5 x 10 5 cells / mL in growth medium , and 547 3 mL volumes of culture were transferred per well to 6 - well tissue culture - treated polystyrene 548 plates ( Sigma CLS3506 ) and incubated at 23°C for 48 hours . For agitation , plates were then 549 placed on an orbital shaker and shaken at 140 RPM for 10 minutes , and then the medium from 550 each well ( “disassociated fraction” ) was transferred to a separate tube and 3 mL of new growth 551 medium was added to each well . 3 μL of 500 mM EDTA was then added to each well to detach 552 23 cells from the culture surface , medium was pipetted up and down over the culture surface 20 553 times , and this resuspension ( “adherent fraction” ) was transferred to a separate tube . Cell 554 densities of the collected fractions were determined by hemocytometer counts , total cell amounts 555 were calculated by adding the cell numbers for disassociated and adherent fractions for each 556 condition , and the percent of adherent cells for each condition was then calculated . As a control 557 to examine cell - substrate adhesion in the absence of agitation , the above protocol was followed , 558 except the orbital shaker agitation step was omitted . 559 560 Time - lapse Microscopy 561 To image cells by time - lapse transmitted light or fluorescence microscopy , cells were 562 resuspended to 1 x 10 8 cells / ml in growth medium , and 10 μl of this cell suspension was added 563 as a spot in the center of a well in a 4 - well chambered coverglass slide ( Nunc ) . After a 1 hour 564 incubation at room temperature to allow the cells to settle , the 10 μl volume of medium was 565 removed , and 1 ml of growth medium was added to the well , resulting in a spot of cells in the 566 center of the well . Cells were incubated at room temperature for 24 hours , a field of view with 567 well - spaced cells was located , and then cells were imaged by time - lapse microscopy using a 568 Nikon Eclipse Ti inverted microscope with NIS - Elements acquisition software . To image the effect 569 of blebbistatin on individual cells , similar imaging of cells was done , except that cells were treated 570 with either DMSO or 1 μm bebbistatin ( Sigma B0560 ) for one hour before imaging . To image 571 aggregates by time - lapse microscopy , aggregates were generated in ultra - low attachment plates 572 as described above . During aggregate formation , 4 - well chambered coverglass slides ( Nunc ) 573 were coated with UltraPure agarose ( ThermoFisher ) by making a 1 % agarose in nuclease - free 574 water mixture , microwaving to dissolve the agarose , adding 800 μl of molten agarose per well , 575 and removing the molten agarose after 10 seconds by aspiration . Coated wells were then allowed 576 to dry at room temperature in a cell culture hood , resulting in a thin coating of agarose . This 577 coating functions to prevent aggregate adhesion to the glass surface . After aggregate formation , 578 24 aggregates were resuspended in the well by gentle pipetting , and then an 800 μl volume of 579 resuspended aggregates was transferred into one agarose - coated well in a 4 - well chambered 580 coverglass slide . Aggregates were then imaged using a Zeiss LSM 880 confocal microscope . 581 582 RNA - seq 583 To perform RNA - seq on Capsaspora cells , WT or coYki - / - cells were collected from growth flasks 584 by removing growth medium , adding fresh growth medium , and resuspending cells attached to 585 the flask by pipetting the medium over the surface . Cells were then diluted to 2 x 10 5 cells / mL , 586 and for each genotype two 75 cm 2 culture flasks were prepared by adding 16 mL of culture dilution 587 to each flask . Culture flasks were incubated at 23°C for 2 days , and then cells were collected by 588 pipetting growth medium over attached cells . Cells were collected by centrifugation at 2100 x g 589 for 5 minutes , and then all cells for each genotype were combined , resuspended in 500 μl of 590 growth medium , and transferred to a microcentrifuge tube . RNA was then prepared with the 591 RNEasy Plus Mini Kit ( Qiagen ) using the QIAshredder spin column ( Qiagen ) to homogenize the 592 lysate . RNA samples were run on an Agilent Tapestation 4200 to determine level of degradation , 593 thus ensuring only high quality RNA was used ( RIN Score 8 or higher ) . A Qubit® 4 . 0 Fluorimeter 594 ( ThermoFisher ) was used to determine the concentration prior to staring library prep . One 595 microgram of total DNAse - treated RNA was then prepared with the TruSeq Stranded mRNA 596 Library Prep Kit ( Illumina ) . Poly - A RNA was purified and fragmented before strand specific cDNA 597 synthesis . cDNA was then A - tailed and indexed adapters were ligated . After adapter ligation , 598 samples were PCR - amplified and purified with AmpureXP beads , then validated again on the 599 Agilent Tapestation 4200 . Before being normalized and pooled , samples were quantified by Qubit 600 then run on an Illumina NextSeq 500 using V2 . 5 reagents . Three biological replicates were 601 sequenced for each genotype , with 22 - 31 million reads generated per sample . The fastq files 602 were checked for quality using fastqc ( v0 . 11 . 2 ) ( Andrews , 2010 ) and fastq _ screen 603 ( v0 . 4 . 4 ) ( Wingett , 2011 ) . Fastq files were mapped to GCF _ 000151315 . 2 reference assembly 604 25 using STAR ( Dobin et al . , 2013 ) . Read counts were then generated using featureCounts ( Liao et 605 al . , 2014 ) . Trimmed Mean of M - values normalization and differential expression analysis were 606 performed using edgeR ( Robinson et al . , 2010 ) ( false discovery rate ( FDR ) < = 0 . 05 , absolute 607 log2 ( fold change ) > = 0 . 5 , log ( counts per million ) > = 0 ) . Phylogenetic trees were downloaded from 608 PhyloDB ( Huerta - Cepas et al . , 2014 ) corresponding to Capsaspora ( PhyID 101 ) and pairwise 609 distances for each gene were extracted using an R package ape ( Paradis and Schliep , 2019 ) . 610 Closest Human and mouse orthologues were then extracted and used to annotate the 611 Capsaspora genes . These annotated gene names were then used with IPA ( Kramer et al . , 2014 ) 612 ( QIAGEN Inc . , https : / / www . qiagenbioinformatics . com / products / ingenuity - pathway - analysis ) to 613 get significantly enriched pathways in “Diseases and Bio Functions” category . To identify 614 functional enrichment in the sets of genes upregulated or downregulated in coYki - / - cells , DAVID 615 Functional Annotation Tool ( Huang da et al . , 2009 ) was used to identify functional categories with 616 FDR < 0 . 05 using all Capsaspora genome genes as the gene population background . 617 618 Statistics 619 All statistics were done using Prism ( GraphPad software , San Diego , CA ) . Student’s t - test was 620 done to compare differences between two groups , and one - way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) 621 with a post - hoc test was used to compare differences among groups greater than two . 622 623 Gene nomenclature 624 In the manuscript we use italicized text to refer to a gene ( e . g . , coYki ) , unitalicized text to refer 625 to a protein ( e . g . , coYki ) , “ - / - “ to indicate a homozygous deletion mutant ( e . g . , coYki - / - ) , and “ > ” 626 to indicate a promoter driving the expression of a gene ( e . g . , EF1 > coYki ) . 627 26 Acknowledgements : 628 We thank the McDermott Sequencing Core and the Next - Generation Sequencing Core for RNA 629 sequencing , and Dr .

( A ) Phylogenetic tree 791 showing conservation of the Hippo pathway in close unicellular relatives of animals . ( B ) A solitary 792 Capsaspora cell showing thin F - actin - enriched projections . Phalloidin and DAPI are used to stain 793 33 F - actin and DNA , respectively . ( C ) Cells at higher densities can contact other cells through 794 projections . Scale bar is 5 microns . ( D - E ) Capsaspora cells were inoculated into either a tissue - 795 culture treated plate ( D ) or a low - adherence plate ( E ) . At 3 days , cells in standard plates grow as 796 a monolayer whereas cells in low - adherence plates form round aggregates . ( F ) An aggregate 797 stained for F - actin shows actin - rich connections between cells within an aggregate . Scale bar is 798 10 microns . ( G ) Strategy for disrupting the coYki gene by homologous recombination . GenR , 799 geneticin resistance cassette ; TBD , Tead - binding domain ; WW , WW domain . ( H ) Strategy for 800 demonstrating disruption of coYki by qPCR . Amplicon 1 corresponds to a region of the coYki gene 801 that should be absent in a homozygous mutant , whereas Amplicon 2 corresponds to a segment 802 of the gene 3’ of the region targeted for deletion . ( I - J ) qPCR of Amplicons 1 and 2 in WT and 803 putative coYki - / - cells . The differences between WT and coYki - / - for both Amplicons 1 and 2 are 804 significant ( t - test ) . 805 See also Figure S1 and S2 . 806 807 808 809 34 810 35 811 Figure 2 . Loss of coYki results in no apparent effect on cell proliferation but alters the 812 morphology of multicellular aggregates . ( A ) To examine proliferation within aggregates , EdU 813 was used to label proliferating cells within aggregates grown in low - adherence plates . ( B ) The 814 percent of cells positive for EdU within aggregates was quantified . Each red circle indicates 815 measurement results for a single aggregate , and mean ± SEM is shown in black . The difference 816 between WT ant coYki - / - cells is not significant ( t - test ) . ( C - D ) WT or coYki - / - cells were inoculated 817 into low - adherence plates , and cell aggregates were imaged at 5 days . Scale bar is 75 microns . 818 ( E - F ) Aggregate size and circularity was measured from aggregate images using ImageJ . The 819 difference in aggregate circularity between WT and coYki - / - is significant ( t - test ) . Bars indicate 820 the mean ± SEM ( n = 3 with 15 aggregates measured for each independent experiment ) , and dots 821 indicate values for individual aggregates . ( G ) Orthogonal views of WT and coYki - / - aggregates 822 are shown . Cell aggregates stably expressing mScarlet were imaged live by confocal microscopy . 823 Red lines show the location of the culture surface . Scale bar is 50 microns . 824 See also Figure S3 . 825 826 827 36 828 829 Figure 3 . Loss of coYki affects cell - substrate adhesion but not cell - cell adhesion . ( A - D ) 830 Cells expressing mScarlet in the WT background ( A - B ) or in the coYki - / - mutant background ( C - 831 D ) were allowed to aggregate as a homogeneous population ( A , C ) or were mixed with 90 % WT 832 cells and allowed to aggregate ( B , D ) . Individual mScarlet - labeled coYki - / - cells associate with 833 WT cells within aggregates ( D’ ) in an organization like that of cells from the WT background 834 labeled with mScarlet ( B’ ) . Scale bar is 75 microns . ( E ) To examine cell - cell adhesion , cells in 835 suspension were gently rotated for an hour to stimulate cluster formation through cell - cell 836 adhesion . Cultures were then examined by hemocytometer and the number of cells per cluster 837 was counted . Each red circle indicates the number of cells in a single cluster , and error bars 838 37 indicate the mean ± SEM of the average number of cells per cluster from 3 independent 839 experiments . Absence of error bars indicates that error is smaller than the plot symbol . The 840 difference in average number of cells per cluster between WT and coYki - / - is not significant ( t - 841 test ) . ( F ) To examine cell - substrate adhesion , adherent cell cultures were either agitated on a 842 rotary shaker for 10 minutes or left untreated , and then the number of adhered and unadhered 843 cells in each culture was counted and the percent of cells adhered to the culture substrate was 844 calculated . 845 846 38 847 848 Figure 4 . Loss of coYki causes bleb - like protrusions at the cell cortex . ( A ) Capsaspora cells 849 on a glass surface were imaged by time - lapse microscopy and individual cells were scored for 850 number of protrusions per minute . A protrusion is defined as a localized extension of the cell 851 boundary that disrupts a previously inert region of the cortex and / or changes the direction of 852 movement of the cell . Differences between WT and coYki - / - are significant ( one - way ANOVA , 853 Tukey’s test ) . Values from 3 independent experiments with 20 cells measured for each condition 854 per experiment are shown . Red dots indicate the measurement from an individual cell , and black 855 39 bars indicate the mean ± SEM of the means from each independent experiment . ( B ) Cells on a 856 glass surface stably expressing Lifeact - mScarlet were imaged focusing on the base of the cell at 857 the substrate ( “basal” ) or at the mid - height of the cell ( “medial” ) . Arrowhead shows an example of 858 Lifeact signal at the base of the cell that remains stationary as the cell moves ( see Video S4 ) . 859 Scale bar is 5 microns . ( C ) Time series of a coYki - / - cell stably expressing Lifeact - mScarlet on a 860 glass surface . White arrows indicate Lifeact - depleted bleb - like protrusions , and yellow 861 arrowheads indicate areas of cell cortex constriction , which correlate with increased Lifeact signal . 862 Scale bar is 5 microns . ( D ) Cells on a glass surface were treated with DMSO or 1 μM blebbistatin 863 for 1 hour , and then cells were imaged by time lapse microscopy and the number of protrusions 864 per cell was quantified . ( E ) Cells were inoculated into low - adherence plates with DMSO ( E’ , E’’’ ) 865 or 1 μM blebbistatin ( E’’ , E’’’’ ) , and aggregates were imaged after 5 days . Scale bar is 75 microns . 866 ( F ) Circularity of aggregates was measured with ImageJ using images of aggregates from the 867 indicated conditions . Black bars indicate the mean ± SEM ( n = 4 with 15 aggregates measured for 868 each independent experiment ) , and red dots indicate the measurements for individual 869 aggregates . Differences in circularity between WT and coYki - / - aggregates treated with DMSO 870 are significant ( one - way ANOVA , Dunnett’s test ) , whereas differences between WT aggregates 871 treated with DMSO and coYki - / - aggregates treated with blebbistatin are not . “Bleb” indicates 872 blebbistatin . 873 874 875 40 876 877 Figure 5 . Functional enrichment of genes differentially expressed in coYki - / - cells . Top 878 enriched categories from the sets of genes significantly downregulated ( A ) or upregulated ( B ) in 879 coYki - / - cells compared to WT are shown . ( C ) Ingeneuity Pathway Analysis was performed on a 880 set of predicted human / mouse orthologs of Capsaspora genes with significant changes in 881 expression in coYki - / - cells .
