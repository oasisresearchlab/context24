These decisions are even more challenging if there are multiple standards , and if there are beneﬁts to belonging to more than one standard . This paper examines the effect of the timing of patents on a ﬁrm’s innovation performance . The strategic logic of real options posits that patent timing is determined by the tension between the value of preemption and the value of waiting . We analyze 680 DVD disc patents in DVD patent pools to test the effect of the timing of patents on innovation performance . Consistent with real options logic , under high uncertainty , the later the timing of the patent , the higher the innovation performance , while under low uncertainty there is an early - mover advantage . © 2016 Elsevier B .

In technology - driven industries , invention in the early stages of development carries uncertainty about technological effective - ness and manufacturing feasibility . Market uncertainty is also high as users’ preferences in demand and the technological means of satisfying those preferences co - evolve ( Huchzermeier and Loch , 2001 ; Ziedonis , 2007 ) . The emergence of industry standards can reduce technological and market uncertainty for all participants . However , the process of arriving at one ( or more ) standard ( s ) poses difﬁcult managerial challenges ( Warner et al . , 2006 ; Ziedonis , 2007 ) . The potential competitive outcome of a convergence to a sin - gle standard increases the risk of failure , because competitors are developing technologies that can be complete substitutes for this single standard . Moreover , many standards in the digital age com - bine complementary innovations from many sources , such that a ﬁrm must be aware of not only its technological issues but also those faced by potential exchange partners as well—partners who could easily turn into competitors . Heterogeneity in demand for the technology can even drive the emergence of multiple standards , 1 ∗ Corresponding author . E - mail addresses : bskim0706 @ gmail . com ( B .

How then should ﬁrms move in the highly uncertain and com - petitive setting of industry standards ? Innovation is often viewed as a race , but perhaps a ﬁrm should strategically forego speed in order to wait until more information becomes available , thus enabling the ﬁrm to further reﬁne its invention before patenting it . These strate - gic considerations suggest that the timing of patenting would affect returns to innovation , because the level of uncertainty changes over the technology’s evolution . Therefore , ﬁling patents at the right time should be a central consideration of a ﬁrm’s innovation strategy . 2 The strategy of simply patenting early and often is not necessarily optimal . For example , during the pre - standard period of GSM ( Global System for Mobile communications ) technology , there was high uncertainty concerning which of the competing technolo - gies would be adopted as the standard . What later became essential patents to the GSM standard from this period were at the time just one of a number of strategic options for the future . A high number broadcast standards ) , video codecs ( MPEG - 2 , H . 264 / MPEG - 4 AVC , and AVS ) and audio codecs ( MP2 , MP3 , AC - 3 , AAC , and HE - AAC ) . While most modern patent pools are formed around a technological standard , multiple standards can be subsumed into a single patent pool . 2 We follow the extant literature that identiﬁes a patent as a codiﬁed “inven - tion” that may lead to a commercialized product , which is an “innovation” ( e . g . , Lemley and Shapiro , 2005 ) . Further , a patent does not equal a technology , but a set of technologies brought together to achieve a purpose . http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . respol . 2016 . 01 . 017 0048 - 7333 / © 2016 Elsevier B . V . All rights reserved . B . Kim et al . / Research Policy 45 ( 2016 ) 914 – 928 915 of patents during this period did not necessarily lead to later dominance in the industry ( Bekkers et al . , 2002 ) . A ﬁrm’s patenting strategy can align with its R & D activities so that the ﬁrm can either set technological standards or quickly meet established standards . Moreover , when multiple technological standards persist , whether a ﬁrm can join many standards can strongly inﬂuence the royalty revenue of its patents via having access to more or fewer licensees . In the strategic management , marketing , and economics litera - tures , the impact of the order of entry into product - market domains has drawn much research attention with mixed empirical results ( Agarwal et al . , 2002 ; Bayus and Agarwal , 2007 ; Christensen et al . , 1998 ; Lieberman and Montgomery , 1998 ) . At the heart of entry - timing decisions are fundamental tradeoffs between the strategic value of commitment ( preemption ) and the strategic value of wait - ing ( a form of ﬂexibility ) under uncertainty ( Ghemawat , 1991 ; Kulatilaka and Perotti , 1998 ) . However , the timing of patents in R & D activities over a technology’s evolution has remained as a crit - ical gap in the extant research literature . The barriers to entry into the upstream technology market and into the downstream prod - uct market are likely to differ , and hence the nature and extent of competition may also vary ( Grossman and Shapiro , 1986 ) . McGrath and Nerkar ( 2004 ) examine entry timing into a technological area , but do not empirically test for innovation performance . Oriani and Sobrero ( 2008 ) investigate the impact of market and technological uncertainty on the valuation of R & D investments , but do not con - sider the timing of the patent decision . Further , Ceccagnoli ( 2009 ) examines the performance implications of preemptive patenting , but does not consider the relationship between the R & D of the incumbent and the R & D of rival entrants . As a result , little is known about how the timing of a patent in the technology domain inﬂu - ences a ﬁrm’s innovation performance under different levels of uncertainty in a multiple - standard context . Based on real options logic , we maintain that the timing of a patent is determined at the margin by the balance between the preemption ( early - mover ) effect and the learning - by - waiting effect , which has been described as a type of real option ( Li et al . , 2007 ; Miller and Folta , 2002 ) . Folta and O’Brien ( 2004 ) suggest the presence of “dueling options” in which both the strategic value of preemption and the strategic value of waiting increase with increasing uncertainty , thus predicting that the net impact of increasing uncertainty on entry is theoretically indeterminate and requires empirical investigation . Further , the economic value of waiting may be eroded by competition ( Li et al . , 2007 ; Smit and Ankum , 1993 ; Smit and Trigeorgis , 2004 ) . We show that the level of uncertainty inﬂuences the timing of the patenting decision , which subsequently impacts innovation performance ( i . e . , the revenue impact on the ﬁrm of its innovative activities ) . 3 Our measure of innovation performance is the number of licensees ( Powers and McDougall , 2005 ) , as licensing data provide objective measures of patent value based on the payment structure of the contract ( Arora and Fosfuri , 2003 ; Kim and Vonortas , 2006 ) . Patent pool formation is a critical event that signiﬁcantly reduces technological uncertainty , and our unit of analysis is the patent . Since DVD and other complex , technology - intensive products incorporate many patents , tracing a ﬁrm’s entry into a particular market or a certain technology ﬁeld through its products can be misleading ; thus , the patent is an appropriate unit of analysis 3 In this context , there are two decisions that the ﬁrm must make : ( 1 ) when should the ﬁrm patent the invention ? ( 2 ) Should a ﬁrm with a patented invention attempt to join a pool ( Layne - Farrar and Lerner , 2011 ) ? The main independent variable of our study , “timing of a patent , ” is measured as the ﬁling date . Therefore , our study addresses the ﬁrst decision . Our sample includes the patents of the ﬁrms that decided to apply and were accepted into a patent pool . We check for sample selection bias to control for the likelihood that any patent in the relevant technological areas ended up in a patent pool ( the second decision ) . for determining when a ﬁrm enters a technology domain . Our sam - ple includes 680 DVD disc patents ﬁled in the US by 14 DVD device manufacturers in patent pools . We selected the DVD industry to test our hypotheses because it is unique in that its players actively engaged in patenting activity and are “at the forefront of designing and implementing patent pools” ( Joshi and Nerkar , 2011 , p . 1147 ) . A patent pool consists of two or more companies agreeing to license technology to each other and / or third parties , which is subject to regulatory approval ( Lerner and Tirole , 2004 ) . Thus , in addition to technological uncertainty , there was also regulatory uncertainty about the likelihood of a patent pool being approved and formed . Prior to the formation of the DVD patent pools in the 1990s , the US Department of Justice had not authorized the formation of any previous patent pools since the 1950s ( Gilbert , 2004 ) ; and there was no guarantee that the participants of the precursor industry standard - setting bodies in DVD technology would be eventually allowed to form patent pools . 4 Our theory regarding the timing of patents in R & D activities posits a First - to - Invent ( FTI ) system , rather than a First - to - File ( FTF ) system . The USPTO followed an FTI system until the implementation of the America Invents Act ( AIA ) in March 16 , 2013 , which is after the formation of the patent pools in this study . On the other hand , other countries where many of the ﬁrms owning the patents included in this study followed and continue to follow an FTF system , and we control for this fact . See Appendix A for more detail on the current study’s context . This study offers the following contributions to the research lit - erature . First , it extends theory and evidence on entry order from the product to the technology domain . We show that the relation - ship between the timing of patents and innovation performance in the technology domain can be better explained through the concept of a “window of opportunity” ( Christensen et al . , 1998 ) rather than simply early - or late - mover advantage . Critiquing the real options literature from within , Folta and O’Brien submit that the empirical focus of real options studies has been almost exclusively on how uncertainty deters investment or entry , thus failing to “empirically consider how uncertainty inﬂuences the choice between waiting and immediate entry” ( 2004 , p . 123 ) . We address this tension between waiting and preemption as a determinant of the ﬁnancial performance of R & D investment under varying uncertainty condi - tions . Second , this study explores the relationship between the tim - ing of patent and innovation performance in the context of patent pools , which has rarely been explored in strategic management . Joshi and Nerkar ( 2011 ) suggest that the formation of patent pools has a negative effect on the quantity and quality of patents gener - ated by both licensors and licensees . Distinct from that empirical research article , we focus on the relationship between licensors’ patenting timing and their innovation performance prior to and after patent - pool formation . A few research studies of patenting 4 Strictly speaking , the Moving Picture Experts Group 2 ( MPEG - 2 ) pool became the ﬁrst patent pool to receive approval in June 1997 , but the number of patents ( 18 ) is too small for detailed analysis . MPEG and DVD technology overlap slightly , but MPEG is also applied to other consumer electronics . The DVD patent pools bun - dle essential patents , which are required for manufacturing the DVD players and discs . The DVD patent pool approval signaled a shift in U . S . government policy and became a precedent for patent pools in other industries and countries ( Joshi and Nerkar , 2011 ) . Since the late 1990s , U . S . Department of Justice ( DOJ ) and the U . S . Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) have given favorable treatment to patent pools as long as they serve no ancillary purpose ( i . e . , traditional collusion or market division ) and allow for independent licensing of the individual patents by their respective owners ( Lerner and Tirole , 2004 ) . DVD patent pools received clearance because they limited the patent portfolio to technically essential patents , which are not competi - tive with each other , and they can help overcome economic holdup problems due to interdependent and overlapping patents ( Gilbert , 2004 ; Heller and Eisenberg , 1998 ; Merges , 1999 ) . We are grateful to an anonymous reviewer for clarifying the issue of regulatory uncertainty . 916 B . Kim et al . / Research Policy 45 ( 2016 ) 914 – 928 decisions have market valuation of the ﬁrm as the dependent vari - able ( Bloom and Van Reenen , 2002 ; Greenhalgh and Rogers , 2006 ) . Many other factors can contribute to the ﬁrm’s overall proﬁtability , and we do not control for the costs of R & D , so we do not use the term “ﬁnancial performance ; ” however , we are measuring ﬁnancial outcomes in terms of licensing , which affects revenues , not just the technological effectiveness of a ﬁrm’s innovations . Third , this study highlights the importance of broadening the perspective of R & D strategy from how to beneﬁt from a single technology standard to how to beneﬁt from multiple technology standards . 5 Thus , it offers novel insights concerning R & D races involving multiple standards . In industries such as digital media , a ﬁrm’s patenting strategy should focus not only on becoming a standard but also belonging to more standard formats . 6 2 . Theoretical background In strategic management , real options logic provides a bridge between corporate ﬁnance and behavioral theories regarding R & D investment decisions ( Bowman and Hurry , 1993 ; Reuer and Tong , 2010 ) . A real option grants a ﬁrm “the right , but not the obligation , to take some action in the future” ( Li et al . , 2007 , p . 35 ) . Determi - nants of real option values are classiﬁed into factors that increase option value , and factors that decrease option value ( McGrath and Nerkar , 2004 ) . Factors that increase the option value to wait provide incentives for ﬁrms to defer entry . Under high uncertainty , defer - ring irreversible commitments can enhance the expected values of investments , and delaying entry enhances ﬁrm value if the value of waiting exceeds the beneﬁts from moving quickly ( Ingersoll and Ross , 1992 ; McDonald and Siegel , 1986 ; Miller and Folta , 2002 ) . Further , knowledge spillovers from competitors may be a critical factor inﬂuencing the option value of waiting and consequently the timing of the patents and impact on innovation performance ( Almeida and Kogut , 1999 ; Jaffe et al . , 1993 ; McGrath , 1997 ) . Conversely , factors decreasing the option value to wait give ﬁrms greater incentive to move quickly . For example , Miller and Folta ( 2002 ) suggest that the threat of preemption decreases the option value to wait , inducing ﬁrms to move more quickly . The incentive for preemptive patenting is often high given the average difference in proﬁtability with and without preemption ( Ceccagnoli , 2009 ) ; patents offer exclusive rights to develop new innovations with an entry - deterring effect ( Bloom and Van Reenen , 2002 ) . The beneﬁts of patent preemption are to check competi - tors’ similar patenting , to have bargaining power in cross - licensing with competitors in patent disputes , and to earn licensing fees . It is expensive to apply for and maintain patents , but this cost is typically less than the costs of a key patent being controlled by competitors . To predict the relationship between the timing of patenting and innovation performance , we extend and apply real options logic to an earlier stage than the stages considered by most prior research . Several papers ( Li et al . , 2007 ; McGrath , 1997 ; McGrath and Nerkar , 2004 ) consider R & D expenditures in new technological areas as the price to create real ( growth ) options , and the costs of second - stage 5 Even knowledgeable practitioners typically over - emphasize the creation of a standard technology to take the lead in the technology domain . We interviewed inventors , scientists , and patent lawyers at two of the major global electronics com - panies that are members of patent pools , which enabled us to learn a great deal about the industry , its competitive dynamics , the race to set standards , and the history of patent pools . 6 Being part of multiple standards does not involve being part of multiple patent pools . In the case of DVD patent pools , ﬁrms were not allowed to be members of both the DVD3C and DVD6C patent pools . There was a regulatory concern about the possibility of collusion and anti - competitive effects ( Joshi and Nerkar , 2011 ; Lampe and Moser , 2013 ; Layne - Farrar and Lerner , 2011 ) . commercialization are incurred to exercise growth options . Although not all R & D effort results in a patent , patenting is a ﬁrm’s strategic decision between the stage of R & D expenditure and com - mercialization . The current study considers the R & D expenditures as creating real options , and the ﬁling of a patent to be the exercise of a real option . Treating the patent as an option exercise is highly warranted because in many technology areas , royalty revenues from patent licensing can be as substantial as , if not more than , the revenues from commercialization of an end product . Our rationale for treating R & D as creating real options and patenting as exercising an option is as follows . It is important to distinguish between real options , which are rights , and their under - pinning resources . By creating a real option , the ﬁrm defers resource acquisition until some future time ( Miller and Folta , 2002 ) . We suggest that our treatment of R & D as creating real options and patenting as exercising an option provides a theoretical logic for explaining and predicting the timing of this phenomenon . When considering the nested nature of the patenting process , there is need for a deeper understanding of patenting . By investing in R & D , the ﬁrm creates the right to purchase the resource , i . e . , patent , which provides a ﬁrm with the ability to check competitors , increase bargaining power , and generate royalty revenues . There is considerable agreement that R & D investment can be considered as creating a real option ( Miller and Folta , 2002 ; Ziedonis , 2007 ) . In this case , the real option is the “right to develop and commercialize technology” ( Miller and Folta , 2002 , p . 656 ) . While commercialization of the technology resulting from the R & D investment stage is clearly exercising an option , the patenting decision occurs prior to the commercialization stage . In fact , the decision - making process from R & D investment to commercializa - tion and licensing in high - technology areas can be described as a series of option creations and exercises : “Sequential R & D invest - ments in pursuit of a technology that is patentable , but may have no current commercial application” ( Miller and Folta , 2002 , p . 660 ) , suitably describes the context of the current study . Explaining the concept of real options , Ziedonis ( 2007 ) compares the price of the option to the initial exploratory R & D expenditure , and the exercise price to the cost of the follow - on investment , which is the cost of ﬁling , renewing , and defending a patent . The patenting deci - sion – i . e . , the exercise of an option – hinges upon the ability to maintain “information asymmetry or other ex - ante barriers to com - petition” ( Leiblein and Ziedonis , 2007 , p . 226 ) . The patent then creates subsequent options called licensing and / or commercializa - tion . Exercising an option with appropriate timing is likely to result in a ﬁrm’s best performance , which depends on the expiration date of the options and arrival of opportunities ( Bowman and Hurry , 1993 ) . In the next section , we develop hypotheses by considering the factors that may determine the timing of patents such as learn - ing opportunities , the potential to preempt , and spillovers from competitors . 3 . Hypotheses Technological uncertainty is a key variable in the strategy and technology management literatures ( e . g . , Mahoney , 2005 ; Oriani and Sobrero , 2008 ) . In the competition to set industry standards , technological uncertainty increases as the number of competing technologies increases . Product life - cycle studies ﬁnd that uncer - tainty peaks prior to the emergence of a dominant design and decreases after a dominant design is established ( Anderson and Tushman , 1990 ; Fleming , 2001 ) . Suarez and Utterback explain that searching for the dominant design date is a challenging task , and suggest that : “licensing data , i . e . , whether a particular product or process starts to capture a large share of the industry’s licensing activity at some time may represent a good way to shed light on B . Kim et al . / Research Policy 45 ( 2016 ) 914 – 928 917 the occurrence of a dominant design” ( 1995 , p . 426 ) . Thus , the date of patent - pool formation offers more precise information on the emergence of a dominant design than market share ( Anderson and Tushman , 1990 ) . In addition , Joshi and Nerkar ( 2011 ) note that patent pools are typically formed when the stage of development is close to commercialization and the market value of the technol - ogy is more clearly ascertainable . As a result , unlike prior empirical studies on dominant design , we expect that the years prior to patent - pool formation ( i . e . , before 1999 ) represent relatively high technological uncertainty , while the years after patent - pool forma - tion represent lower technological uncertainty . 7 Nelson and Winter ( 1982 ) distinguished between two types of innovation periods : the entrepreneurial regime ( Schumpeter I ) versus the routinized regime ( Schumpeter II ) . Although this distinction was originally applied to the product - market domain , the period before patent - pool formation in the current study could be compared to the entrepreneurial regime . This period is characterized by Schum - peterian ‘creative destruction’ ( Malerba and Orsenigo , 1996 ) and a widening pattern of innovative activities as ﬁrms pursue multi - ple technology trajectories due to the high uncertainty surrounding users’ preferences and the technological means of satisfying them ( Agarwal et al . , 2002 ) . Typically , patent pools are formed after key innovations have been developed ( Gilbert and Katz , 2011 ) . There - fore , technological uncertainty can be said to have declined after patent - pool formation . 3 . 1 . Timing of patents and innovation performance before patent - pool formation First , the current study considers the period starting from the application year of the earliest patent in DVD patent pools until the year of the patent - pool formation . Since sources of knowledge critical to new innovations reside outside of their established routines ( Winter , 1984 ) , ﬁrms are likely to be cautious in making irreversible investment decisions and thus are likely to choose an option to wait for more information . The entry decision is typically irreversible , whereas the decision to defer entry is reversible ( McDonald and Siegel , 1986 ) . Merton states that : “In an uncertain environment , having the ﬂexibility to decide what to do after some of that uncertainty is resolved deﬁnitely has value” ( 1998 , p . 339 ) . The extant real options literature considers both exogenous and endogenous uncertainty ( Dixit and Pindyck , 1994 ; Folta , 1998 ; Ziedonis , 2007 ) . While exogenous uncertainty is reduced through waiting , it is more or less independent of actions of the ﬁrms – i . e . , the problem is decision theoretic . On the contrary , ﬁrms’ active involvement could resolve endogenous uncertainty , which encourages early investment ( Dixit and Pindyck , 1994 ) – i . e . , the problem is now vastly more challenging strategically because it is game - theoretic . When considering an investment decision , a ﬁrm is engaged in a game not only against exogenous environmental uncertainty , but also against rivals ( Li et al . , 2007 ) . Leading ﬁrms , especially those with large R & D expenditures , which have suc - cessfully organized patent pools before , may drive the resolution of endogenous technological uncertainty by proposing a dominant design to smaller exchange partners . However , even the leading ﬁrms face exogenous uncertainty about issues including demand , manufacturing feasibility , and regulatory approval of products or 7 A dominant design incorporates a range of basic design choices that do not change in subsequent designs ( Henderson and Clark , 1990 ) . A U - shaped relationship between market uncertainty ( i . e . , the variability of expected demand for products ) and the likelihood of entry is reported ( Folta and O’Brien , 2004 ) , while an inverse U - shaped relationship has been found between technological uncertainty ( i . e . , which technology will emerge to dominate ) and R & D valuation ( Oriani and Sobrero , 2008 ) . We consider mainly technological uncertainty , focusing on the early research ( R ) part of the R & D process . a patent pool ; and exogenous uncertainty is only reducible with the passage of time ( Li et al . , 2007 ) . Therefore , the option value of waiting is high so long as exoge - nous uncertainty is being reduced over time . Folta and O’Brien ( 2004 ) submit that high uncertainty , in the absence of compe - tition , negatively inﬂuences the entry decision . Since signiﬁcant competition is not present or revealed until after patent pool for - mation ( Warner et al . , 2006 ) , the waiting option will have a higher value until that milestone . Speciﬁcally , waiting provides the ﬁrm two opportunities in the face of competition : to further develop its knowledge resources through R & D investment , and to learn from competitors and adjust to a better ﬁt with exchange partners . Taking more time to develop proprietary knowledge can yield both superior inventions compared to competitors , and enhanced absorptive capacity to understand and react to competitors’ technology - based moves ( Cohen and Levinthal , 1990 ) . Competitive entry is a signal of a technological area’s economic attractiveness , and can also make this area more valuable by increasing the total investment in knowledge creation across all actors ( Hambrick et al . , 1983 ) . Other ﬁrms’ behavior can signal the worth of an emerging area , resulting in a ‘bunching of investment’ ( Dixit , 1992 ; Trigeorgis , 1996 ) . Certainly , if a patent is preempted by a rival patent , the economic value of the option created through R & D falls to zero . Thus , the optimal timing requires waiting until just prior to a rival’s options exercise , because waiting in the face of competition implies a loss in the expected economic value of the project ( Smit and Ankum , 1993 ) . For a single ﬁrm , the beneﬁt of waiting to see which technological area has potential for high returns , and to invest in R & D to claim a niche in that area , is likely to be highest in the early period of discovery . However , McGrath and McGrath state : “When a new techno - logical area is just emerging , it is in the collective interest of all participants to invest to create a substantive body of underly - ing scientiﬁc knowledge and even to share this knowledge with one another” ( 2001 , p . 6 ) . In pooling patents with other ﬁrms , an organization makes a strategic choice to reduce uncertainty in its exchange relationships with others ( Gulati et al . , 2000 ) and to increase the total economic proﬁt of the alliance constellation ( Gomes - Casseres , 2003 ) . Patent pools reduce uncertainty by facili - tating resource exchange ( Dunford , 1987 ) . The contractual parties in patent pools have access to each other’s technologies , and they have control over the development of technologies to increase others’ dependence on their patented technologies ( Pfeffer and Salancik , 1978 ) . Even prior to the formation of the pool , technology standards establish inter - connectivity and inter - operability among multiple components and deﬁne which technologies will survive ( Warner et al . , 2006 ) . Standard setting can be a cooperative arrangement or alliance formation in order to maximize total industry value and preserve the value of the future growth opportunity ( Miller and Folta , 2002 ) . Leading ﬁrms usually have technologies and a sense of direction regarding technological development . In standard - setting meetings , these ﬁrms release general information on the technology standard . Other ﬁrms study such information in order to suggest their own technology to be included as standard . Thus , as the technology moves toward a dominant design , ﬁrms will beneﬁt most from positive spillover effects , and just prior to patent - pool formation may be the best timing to maximize learning . 8 8 For example , for smart phones , a leading ﬁrm with touch technology may sug - gest the need for a new input mechanism at a standard - setting meeting . The ﬁrm might not directly indicate its intention for ‘touch . ’ Rather , it would suggest that the conventional ‘button’ mechanism is inconvenient . Participating ﬁrms would then analyze the relevant information regarding this suggestion and ﬁle their own patents . Later , ﬁrms will go through a negotiation process to select the standard 918 B . Kim et al . / Research Policy 45 ( 2016 ) 914 – 928 The cooperative nature of formal standards might decrease the value of waiting if owning granted patents gives a ﬁrm greater negotiating power in the timing and membership of a patent pool . For example , a ﬁrm with early patents could seek an advanta - geous position in the pool’s governing body ( Warner et al . , 2006 ) . However , the leading ﬁrms that play a key role in shaping these out - comes are usually established , large competitors ( McGrath , 1997 ; Teece , 1998 ) . These leading ﬁrms have no need to ﬁle early since they can use their dominant position to inﬂuence standardization ; and trailing or nascent ﬁrms are not likely to achieve inﬂuence sim - ply through owning a few patents , however valuable . In the end , selection to a patent pool is governed by an independent exam - iner , not primarily a result of competitor negotiation . Thus , while ﬁrms take competition and cooperation into account , the beneﬁts of waiting should not be entirely offset by a race to gain a foothold in a new area . Therefore , ﬁrms will delay the entry decision in order to learn and gain more information , but will attempt to commit before the point of being preempted by rivals , which implies that patenting will accelerate as the time approaches the patent - pool formation . Moreover , among the patents eventually chosen for the patent pool , those patents ﬁled later in the pre - pool period will be more valuable than those ﬁled earlier because the ﬁrm will have had more time to develop its knowledge resources through R & D investment and to learn from competitors and adjust to a better ﬁt with exchange partners . Hypothesis 1 . Prior to patent - pool formation , the later the timing of the patent , the higher the number of licensees through the patent pool . 3 . 2 . Timing of patents and innovation performance after patent - pool formation Next we consider the period starting from the year of patent - pool formation ( 1999 ) until when the last patent enters the DVD patent pools ( 2006 ) . This period is equivalent to the routinized regime ( Nelson and Winter , 1982 ; Winter , 1984 ) , which is char - acterized as ‘creative accumulation’ ( Malerba and Orsenigo , 1996 ) and a deepening , instead of widening , pattern of innovation as system - wide compatibility and integration become vital ( Agarwal et al . , 2002 ) . Further , this period is dominated by endogenous uncertainty as opposed to exogenous uncertainty ( Ziedonis , 2007 ) . We maintained above that the entry decision will likely be delayed during a period of high uncertainty mainly due to the real option value of enhanced learning opportunities . However , as uncertainty is reduced over time , the beneﬁts of waiting decrease ( McGrath and Nerkar , 2004 ) . After patent - pool formation , little additional information will be generated about the trajectory of the new technology . Thus , when the uncertainty cannot be further reduced by waiting , it is time for preemption to start . When preemption of competitive entry is possible , the economic incentive to exercise the option is intensiﬁed despite high uncertainty ( Kulatilaka and Perotti , 1998 ) . Preemption refers to strategic ( irreversible ) invest - ments that reduce the value of competitors’ returns to R & D by deterring their entry ( Ceccagnoli , 2009 ; Miller and Folta , 2002 ) . In the period immediately following patent - pool formation , moving late may entirely preclude revenue generation potential , similar technology . The ﬁnal decision may not be solely based on technological superiority . Such learning and spillover mechanisms are particularly applicable to technologies with long cycle times where building up a friendly constellation of ﬁrms is impor - tant in dominating in the standard setting , and when ﬁrms have worked together on previous standards . DVDs and TVs had much longer cycle times than smart phones , and DVDs shared many aspects of CD technology . Fig . 1 . Hypothesized relationships between timing of patents and innovation per - formance . to a situation of technological lockout ( Ghemawat , 1991 ) . Miller and Folta ( 2002 , p . 660 ) note that when patents are interdepen - dent , the potential to enhance real option value , or avoid the loss of option value , by preempting rivals must be the sole motivation for exercising options . As the ‘phase of certainty’ continues , the risk of preemption becomes more severe . Kester ( 1984 ) suggests that any growth option tends to be exercised early if it is common among the competitors . In comparison , in the product - market domain , after a dominant design emerges the number of ﬁrms in the industry rapidly decreases ( Utterback and Suarez , 1993 ) . The evolution - ary process changes the source of competitive advantage , and the emergence of a dominant design implies intensiﬁcation of scale or knowledge barriers ( Nelson and Winter , 1982 ; Utterback and Abernathy , 1975 ) . Beyond this point , entry will become more difﬁ - cult for late movers . While a technological breakthrough could still occur , the likelihood that a ﬁrm will try to ﬁle a new patent with a possibility of inclusion in the patent pool organization is lessened by the extent to which the organization has already been market - ing existing products and features to customers . 9 Thus , following patent - pool formation , early entry will have a positive inﬂuence on innovation performance as reﬂected in the potential for royalty revenue from more licensees . The sooner a patent becomes part of the licensing system , the more revenue it can generate . 10 Fig . 1 summarizes our hypotheses concerning the relationship between timing of patents and innovation performance . Hypothesis 2 . After patent - pool formation , the earlier the timing of patent , the higher the number of licensees through the patent pool . 9 As discussed in Appendix A , there are three decisions involved : ( 1 ) when to ﬁle a patent , ( 2 ) whether to join a patent pool , and ( 3 ) an independent examiner’ permission . Decisions ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are made by the ﬁrms . Decision ( 3 ) is made by a third party . A ﬁrm decides whether to submit its patents for evaluation , after which the independent examiner determines how essential is each patent ( Joshi and Nerkar , 2011 ; Lampe and Moser , 2013 ) . Decision ( 1 ) is our study’s focus . Decision ( 2 ) is controlled by sample selection bias analysis . Decision ( 3 ) is an important factor in the whole process , but is not the main part of our analysis . 10 Many patents ﬁled after the pool formation are likely to have been invented before the pool . New patents can be ﬁled through divisional applications . In case of DVD , there was no restriction regarding the number of divisional applications . For example , a patent for a device can be divided into new patents for a device , method , and media . In this case , these new patents are mostly derivative patents of the original one . The exception would be when a version - up standard is introduced ( e . g . , from single layer to double sided dual layer in terms of disc capacity ) and a new set of relevant patents are ﬁled . In either case , patents ﬁled after pool formation did not receive different weights when distributing royalties . In private communication with the authors , members of one DVD pool clariﬁed that it had a “term system , ” which deﬁned that a patent ﬁled between certain points of time could earn royalties from the products produced between certain points of time . Such a system induces more and faster patent ﬁlings . B . Kim et al . / Research Policy 45 ( 2016 ) 914 – 928 919 Table 1 Frequency of patenting .

Methods 4 . 1 . Sample and data sources We collect patents for all DVD devices such as players , recorders , decoders , drives and discs from the DVD Patent Pools website as of April 2009 . We focus on 686 DVD disc patents ﬁled by 14 DVD device manufacturers . These patents belong to three playable stan - dards ( DVD - ROM , DVD - Audio and DVD - Video ) and ﬁve recordable standards ( DVD - RAM , DVD - R , DVD + R , DVD - RW and DVD + RW ) . We exclude six DVD disc patents because they have no backward cita - tions ( necessary for the measurement of technology cycle time ) . Therefore , our sample is cross - sectional data including 680 DVD disc patents . 11 Of these , 150 patents belong to 3C and 530 to 6C . We then collect three - digit U . S . Patent and Trademark Ofﬁce ( USPTO ) technology classes where each of these 680 patents is included . Based on these technology classes , we ﬁnd that nine tech - nology classes comprise DVD disc technology . US Patent Classes with more than ten patents include 369 ( 365 patents ) , 386 ( 161 patents ) , 714 ( 26 patents ) , 380 ( 16 patents ) , 375 ( 15 patents ) , and 382 ( 12 patents ) . We gather information on the patents and assignees from USPTO databases . Table 1a shows the members of two patent pools including ﬁrms that joined after the formation of the pool , as well as the frequency of DVD patent ﬁlings from 1988 to 2006 measured as of 2009 . Table 1b reports the assignment of these patents to one or more standards within each patent pool . The num - ber of licensees to each standard in each pool is obtained from the DVD Format / Logo Licensing Corporation website as of April 2009 . Standard and Poor’s COMPUSTAT database provides ﬁnancial data for the sample ﬁrms . 11 The pool patents and additional information were collected from the following websites ( as of April 9 , 2009 ) : • DVD 3C Patent Pool ( www . licensing . philips . com ) • DVD 6C Patent Pool ( www . dvd6cla . com ) • DVD + RW Alliance ( www . dvdrw . com ) • DVD Forum ( www . dvdforum . org ) , DVD FAQ ( www . dvddemystiﬁed . com / dvdfaq . html ) . 4 . 2 . Dependent variable Number of licensees : to evaluate innovation performance , we measure the number of licensees as of 2009 . This variable is a key measure of the effectiveness of ﬁrms’ licensing activities . The number of licensees may be the best available proxy for the eco - nomic value that companies may derive from the inventions , as it captures the market acceptance of each standard or technology . There is a strong probability of a patent with more licensees earning higher royalty income . We calculate the number of licensees listed on the DVD Format / Logo Licensing Corporation website in April 2009 . Fig . 2 shows schematically the time line of DVD disc stan - dards and data measurement . Note that most of the standards ( e . g . , DVD - ROM ) were not exclusive to one patent pool . The standards were decided with broad industry participation to satisfy hetero - geneous customer demand , with some standards being introduced after the formation of both patent pools . 4 . 3 . Explanatory variable Timing of patents : timing of patents is an ordinal measure of the ﬁling date ( the ﬁrst patent is assigned 1 , the second 2 , and so on ) . Since our sample includes 680 DVD disc patents , timing of patents is a continuous variable ranging from 1 to 680 . The ﬁrst recordable DVD disc patent was ﬁled on April 23 , 1988 , and the last patent was ﬁled on January 12 , 2006 . 4 . 4 . Control variables Involvement : ﬁrms differ in their extent of involvement in the patent pools , which could inﬂuence the economic value that they derive from their innovation activities ( Lavie et al . , 2007 ) . The degree of involvement in a patent pool is measured by the extent of a ﬁrm’s involvement as a member of each pool’s consortium ( C ) , steering committee ( SC ) , and service as work group chair ( WG ) . 12 12 While the steering committee ( SC ) and work group ( WG ) are bodies oper - ated after the pool was formed , the consortium ( C ) existed prior to the US DOJ’s approval of the formation of the patent pools . It functioned as the precursor industry 920 B . Kim et al . / Research Policy 45 ( 2016 ) 914 – 928 Fig . 2 . Timeline of DVD disc standards and data measurement . When the involvement in the patent pools includes C , SC , and WG , then the involvement has the highest value of 3 . C and SC are coded as 2 . Only SC is coded 1 , otherwise , it is coded 0 . We use the infor - mation on the governance structure in the DVD forum’s ofﬁcial website , supplemented by the interviews with the patent lawyers and engineers in two major global electronics companies that are also the members of the patent pools . R & D intensity : ﬁrms differ in their commitment to innovative activities . We include R & D intensity to reﬂect this difference . We use the ratio of R & D expense to sales rather than R & D expense , because the ratio controls for size and heteroscedasticity ( Hambrick et al . , 1983 ) . Advertising intensity is the ratio of marketing expenditures to sales ( e . g . , Chang , 2003 ) , representing a ﬁrm’s capabilities of understanding and appreciating the market , which help the ﬁrm to capture promising technologies and have more bargaining power . Firm size is the natural log of a ﬁrm’s total assets ( Agarwal et al . , 2002 ) . Firm age is measured as the number of years elapsed from the year of founding . Patent pool : there are two competing DVD patent pools , 3C and 6C . Each patent pool earmarks a different running royalty for standards - setting body . It should be noted that not all members of the earlier standard setting efforts ended up participating in the subsequent pools . Some ﬁrms chose not to be included in the pools . Others intended to participate in the pool but their proposed patents might have been rejected by the independent examiner for inclusion in the pool . We are grateful to an anonymous reviewer for this note . licensing through patent pools . When an assignee belongs to 6C , the dummy variable is coded as a value of 1 , otherwise , 0 . Number of inventors : this variable is measured by the number of inventors listed in the patent . The number of inventors is a proxy of the effort or intellectual resources invested in solving an innovation problem . A greater number of inventors may denote a greater level of effort in the face of difﬁcult technological challenges ( Fleming and Sorenson , 2004 ) . Quality of an invention is posited to increase with the number of inventors ( Reitzig and Puranam , 2009 ; Sapsalis et al . , 2006 ) . Science Linkage is included to evaluate whether a ﬁrm’s tech - nology is built on applied science or basic science ( Coombs and Bierly , 2006 ) , and is measured by the number of “other publica - tions” referenced on the front page of the patent’s documentation ( Bierly and Chakrabarti , 1996 ; Narin et al . , 1987 ) . A patent refer - ring to basic science is more likely to represent radical innovation , which is related to the quality of the patent . Technology cycle time ( TCT ) captures elements of the speed of the technology cycle in an industry . High TCT means that the patent is based on an old technology , or is in the mature stage of the tech - nology trajectory , and thus might not be economically attractive to licensees , leading to fewer royalties . We measure the time between a patent and its prior art ( Narin , 1999 ) as the median age in years of the patent’s backward citations ( Oriani and Sobrero , 2008 ) . Patent family : a patent family consists of the same patent granted in different countries , which indicates how widely an inno - vation is used ( Lanjouw and Mody , 1996 ) . Sapsalis et al . ( 2006 ) suggest that the size of a patent family indicates patent value which is closely related to innovation performance . A patent family is measured by the number of patents with the same priority number . B . Kim et al . / Research Policy 45 ( 2016 ) 914 – 928 921 Reputation : when there are competing standards , having more patents in a standard signals higher attractiveness of that standard to licensees ( McGrath and Nerkar , 2004 ) , which then inﬂuences innovation performance . We measure reputation as the number of patents in the same patent pool and in the same standard ( e . g . , for a patent in 3C and DVD - ROM , we count the number of patents in 3C and DVD playable standards at the time the focal patent was ﬁled ) . 4 . 5 . Instrumental variables We include instrumental variables related to assignee’s ten - dency to follow their country system ( FTI or FTF ) and the complexity of patent ownership to resolve possible endogeneity issues involv - ing the timing of patent ﬁling . A detailed explanation is provided in the model speciﬁcation section below . Country of origin : Japanese and Dutch companies have played the main role in compact discs and subsequently in the DVD indus - try . These companies are likely to enter earlier than the others . Further , each assignee may have a tendency to follow its coun - try system , either First - to - Invent ( FTI ) or First - to - File ( FTF ) . During the study period , the U . S . was under the FTI system while other countries under FTF . Under the FTF system , there may be less incen - tive to delay ﬁling a patent . We include Japan as a base dummy , United States , Netherlands , and Korea . The fourteen manufacturers in our dataset each belong to one of these countries . Number of assignees : when an invention is made by two or more corporations , they ( assignees ) apply for a patent jointly ( Terry , 1999 ) . Co - owned patents usually emerge from small - scale inter - ﬁrm R & D collaboration where the companies are unable to divide the invention among the exchange partners ( Hagedoorn , 2003 ) . These patents require complex contractual arrangements regarding efﬁcient distribution of obligations across future contin - gencies that are bound to be incomplete ( Hagedoorn and Hesen , 2007 ) . In the U . S . legal system , patent infringement suits can only be brought if all owners are named in the lawsuit , unlike in other countries where co - owners can individually ﬁle patent suits ( Hagedoorn , 2003 ) . Therefore , joint patenting increases complexity and uncertainty , and a higher number of assignees may slow down the entry decision . Scope of invention : we use this instrumental variable in the ﬁrst stage of a Heckman ( 1979 ) two - step procedure ( see Appendix B ) . Scope is measured as the number of claims in the patent documen - tation . A patent typically consists of a collection of claims ( Tong and Frame , 1994 ) . In the claim section in a patent , each claim declares a distinct technical contribution ( McGrath and Nerkar , 2004 ) . The more claims , the more potential application areas for a patent ( Lanjouw and Schankerman , 1999 ) , which inﬂuences a ﬁrm’s entry decision into patent pools . 4 . 6 . Model speciﬁcation We test our hypotheses for two time periods , prior to and after patent - pool formation . The dependent variable , the number of licensees , is a count variable . A Poisson regression model deals with count dependent variables . However , it is sensitive to the dis - tributional assumption . We conduct a Hausman ( 1978 ) test on the similarity in the coefﬁcient between a Poisson model and a Neg - ative binomial model , which allows over - dispersion . The results indicate that the coefﬁcients of Negative binomial model are not consistent in our case . Therefore , we use the Poisson regression . And , the explanatory variable , timing of patent ( ﬁling ) , may be endogenously determined . Thus , we run ivpoisson , which accounts for the endogeneity of a ﬁrm’s decision to enter the technology domain . In Stata ( version 13 . 1 ) , ivpoisson estimates the parame - ters of a Poisson regression model in which some of the regressors are endogenous . The timing of patent ﬁling is likely to depend on the assignee’s tendency to follow their country system ( FTI or FTF ) and the com - plexity of patent ownership . Thus , we utilize country of origin and the number of assignees as instrumental variables . Using ‘estat overid’ in Stata , we can obtain Hansen’s ( 1982 ) J - statistic , which is used to determine the validity of the over - identifying restrictions in a GMM ( Generalized Method of Moments ) model ( Hall , 2005 ) . The testing results indicate that the over - identifying restriction is valid by not rejecting the null hypothesis ( Hilbe , 2011 ) . Therefore , our instrumental variables are appropriate to test the relationship between timing of patent and the number of licensees . We run ivpoisson models in Stata with the endogenous variable timing of patent , using both one - and two - step GMM estimators . 13 The standard output from the two - step estimator does not report the ﬁrst - stage estimates , so we report the empirical results of the ﬁrst - stage regression ( i . e . , the coefﬁcients and statistical sig - niﬁcance of the instrumental variables ) using a one - step GMM estimator , and then show the second - stage estimates from the two - step estimator . Lastly , because the sample includes only the patents belong - ing to patent pools , a question of sample selection bias could be raised . It can be challenged whether our sample is random , because those patents in the patent pools were selected at the point of patent - pool formation . As a result , we tested for sample selection bias regarding ﬁrms’ entry into a patent pool following Heckman’s ( 1979 ) two - step procedure . This procedure creates a control vari - able ( the inverse Mills ratio ) which is included in the second - stage regression . We ﬁnd that the coefﬁcient of the inverse Mills ratio is not statistically signiﬁcant . Therefore , we report regressions that exclude this ratio ( see Appendix B ) . 5 . Results Table 2 presents the descriptive statistics and correlations of the variables used in this study . 14 We test our hypotheses after control - ling for endogeneity problems caused by a ﬁrm’s timing of patent decisions . Table 3 presents the ivpoisson estimates for innovation performance . Our hypothesis testing is based on the full models ( Models 2 and 4 ) . Hypothesis 1 predicted that , prior to patent - pool formation , the later the timing of the patent , the higher the number of licensees in the patent pool . Hypothesis 2 predicted that , after patent - pool formation , the earlier the timing of a patent , the higher the number of licensees in the patent pool . Both Hypotheses 1 and 2 are cor - roborated . These empirical results indicate that late entry leads to higher innovation performance under a higher level of uncertainty , and early entry leads to higher performance under a lower level of uncertainty . Further , the slope of the coefﬁcient of patent timing prior to patent - pool formation is less steep than after patent - pool formation . This result shows not only the direction but also the magnitude of the impact of patent timing change around patent - pool formation . The effects are economically substantive . A one unit increase in ordinal rank of patent timing prior to patent pool for - mation translates into a 0 . 4 % increase in the number of licensees or a 1 . 1 % decrease after patent pool formation . 15 13 Two - step GMM obtains parameter estimates based on an initial weight matrix , calculates a new weight matrix based on those estimates , and then re - estimates the parameters using that weight matrix ( Hall , 2005 ) . 14 There are no extremely high correlations between variables , but to reduce the possibility of multicollinearity , we check variance inﬂation factors . The highest VIF is 9 . 23 with mean of 3 . 15 , below the typical cutoff value of 10 ( Neter et al . , 1990 ) . More - over , the highest value of the condition index is 9 . 06 , below 20 as recommended in Greene ( 1997 ) . 15 We test the same models with the ﬁling year and ﬁling date of a patent instead of the ordinal measure of patent timing . Results are the same except for a lower 922 B .

To resolve endogeneity in the timing of patent ﬁling , we include two instrumental variables . Prior to patent - pool formation ( Model 1 in Table 3 ) , the country of origin is related to the entry decision . A Dutch company ( Philips ) has played a major role in the CD and DVD industries , entering earlier than Japanese ﬁrms . Korean ﬁrms were later than the Japanese . After patent - pool formation ( Model 3 in Table 3 ) , the effect of county of origin is the same as prior to patent - pool formation . Also , patents with a higher number of assignees tend to enter later , but only after patent - pool formation . As for control variables , involvement , R & D intensity , and ﬁrm size are positively related to the number of licensees only after patent - pool formation . Belonging to the 6C patent pool leads to fewer licensees than belonging to the 3C before formation , but this effect becomes statistically insigniﬁcant after patent - pool forma - tion . Further , reputation is signiﬁcantly and negatively related to the number of licensees only after patent - pool formation . Technol - ogy cycle time has a stronger negative impact after pool formation . After patent - pool formation ( Model 4 in Table 3 ) , the number of inventors and size of the patent family are positively related to the number of licensees . Moreover , a larger patent family represents more global technology usage , so it could increase the number of licensees and is subsequently related to innovation performance . The number of inventors has a positive coefﬁcient both prior to and after pool formation . While many studies consider the number of inventors to correspond to the quality of an invention ( Reitzig and Puranam , 2009 ; Sapsalis et al . , 2006 ) , that may not be the case for this particular sample . If there is an incentive to include all R & D team members as co - inventors on a patent produced by any team member due to industry norms or an organization’s incen - tive scheme , there may be little correlation between the number of inventors and the quality of the invention . The majority of the patenting ﬁrms in our sample are Japanese , where such norms often apply . However , running our regressions with or without the number of inventors did not change the empirical results . To examine this phenomenon further , we split the sample into the patents of the leading ﬁrms around which the two pools coalesced ( Matsushita , Philips , Sony , and Toshiba ) versus all others . As shown in Table 1 , most of the leading ﬁrms’ patents in the pool were ﬁled in the few years leading up to pool formation . Thus , even though these ﬁrms arguably had the most information ( to reduce endogenous uncertainty ) , they still tended to wait until close to pool formation to ﬁle for patents . 16 Highly involved ﬁrms with embedded ties ( Granovetter , 1985 ; Uzzi , 1997 ) in DVD consortia , steering committees , and work groups have more opportunities for knowledge sharing including access to technical and market infor - mation , networking , and investment opportunities . They are also more likely to be able to set the agenda , align their objectives , con - trol the decision - making process , and effectively leverage alliance resources ( Lavie et al . , 2007 ; Saxton , 1997 ) . In our context , the lead - ing ﬁrms beneﬁtted from their control of the formation date by ﬁling the majority of their patents beforehand . Leading ﬁrms ﬁled over 60 % of their patents that would eventually be in the pool prior to the announcement ; whereas other ﬁrms ﬁled only 42 % of their pool patents by that date . However , even controlling for this beneﬁt of being a leading ﬁrm through the involvement variable and other statistical signiﬁcance level prior to patent formation when using the actual dates . In terms of economic impact , being a year “early” prior to patent pool formation would cost a ﬁrm 18 . 66 % of the average number of licensees , while being a year “later” after patent pool formation would decrease the average number of licensees by 43 . 77 % . 16 We ran separate models for the two sub - samples , but since there are only a few leading ﬁrms , we could not employ ﬁrm ﬁxed effects or many of the control variables , so we do not report the results here .

Discussion and conclusion Researchers have long been interested in how the order of entry into a product / market domain inﬂuences sales , market share , pro - ﬁtability , and survival ( Agarwal et al . , 2002 ; Alpert and Kamins , 1995 ; Christensen et al . , 1998 ; Mitchell and Singh , 1993 ; Suarez and Utterback , 1995 ) . Yet , little research has focused on how entry into technology domains inﬂuences ﬁrm outcomes . The current study addresses this imbalance by examining the timing of patent - ing in the race to develop technological standards for DVDs . We apply real options logic to entry decisions at an earlier stage than that considered by most prior research , treating a patent as the exercise of a real option . We maintain that the timing of patent - ing is determined by the balance between the preemption effect and the learning - by - waiting effect and that the impact of tim - ing of a patent would be different during times of higher and lower environmental uncertainty . Our empirical ﬁndings corrobo - rate theory - driven expectations that the value of waiting increases under high uncertainty while the value of preemption increases under lower uncertainty . Prior to patent - pool formation , late entry has a positive relationship with innovation performance , while early entry has a positive relation with performance after pool formation . 6 . 1 . Implications for theory The current study raises the key strategic question of the optimal timing of irreversible investment commitment , and the answer seems to be the ending phase of high uncertainty and the beginning phase of relatively greater certainty , which tips the balance from the value of waiting ( ﬂexibility ) toward the value of preemption ( commitment ) . Our study’s result suggests that ﬁrst - mover advantage for innovation performance does not exist in DVD patent pools . Early entry under high uncertainty , by moving before understanding the interplay among ﬁrms and technologies , may not offer gains in innovation performance . However , as uncertainty is reduced , preemptive moves become important . Thus , around the patent - pool formation period is likely to be the optimal timing for a ﬁrm to leverage spillovers from competitors and preemption . This empirical ﬁnding supports the view that spillovers from competitors are critical in determining the timing of entry and the innovation performance in the technology domain ( Almeida and Kogut , 1999 ; Jaffe et al . , 1993 ) . As the technological spillover increases , the value of waiting goes up . This implies that an ideal timing of exercising an option in technological domain should be determined around the peak of technological spillover . Thus , in the study of entry timing based on real options logic , researchers should consider when the technological spillover begins , peaks , and recedes . Our empirical result is also consistent with Christensen et al . ( 1998 ) , which ﬁnds that a ﬁrm’s entry into 924 B . Kim et al . / Research Policy 45 ( 2016 ) 914 – 928 the product - market domain during a “window of opportunity” – just prior to the emergence of a dominant design – was critical for its survival , especially in a fast - changing industry . The empirical results of the current study show that patent tim - ing follows a real options logic . A ﬁrm may have started investing in DVD technologies very early and come up with a wide range of related technologies . It could choose to ( 1 ) ﬁle many patents that are potentially useful in multiple standards , and then later join a certain patent pool using a subset of its patent portfolio , or ( 2 ) keep the technologies conﬁdential , and then ﬁle the related patents after ( or just before ) deciding to join a certain patent pool . We maintain that early - ﬁled patents such as the ﬁrst case have less possibility to join multiple standards and thereby earn higher royalty revenue . Further , we submit that if the second case occurs around the time of patent - pool formation , the patent has more potential to join multi - ple standards due to the opportunity for learning that comes from waiting . In general , the possibility of preemption is considered to increase under uncertain circumstances ( Reinganum , 1983 ) . Inven - tors often times ﬁle patent applications without a clear idea of whether the invention will be a commercial success , as well as sometimes whether the category of invention is even patentable ( Lemley and Shapiro , 2005 ) . The current study challenges this con - ventional wisdom by showing that real options logic can operate not only in the commercialization stage but also in the much earlier patenting stage . Most previous research studies on patenting treat a patent as a creation of an option , and the exercise of the option takes place in the commercialization stage . Even studies on patent fencing or preemption analyze the moves in the product stage ( e . g . , Ceccagnoli , 2009 ) . Our study shows that patenting can be an exer - cise of an option created earlier . Then , the conventional wisdom of ‘ﬁling early is better’ may need to be modiﬁed under the scrutiny of real options logic . In addition , the current study’s context cov - ers the entire cycle of a technological evolution from the point of an industry’s beginning . Strategically , it can be wise to wait under conditions of high uncertainty . In conclusion , the current study makes the following research contributions . First , this study examines order of entry and inno - vation performance in the technology domain , testing ﬁrst - mover advantage in an earlier stage of an industry evolution process than prior research on the product / market domain . Innovation perfor - mance of a patent is measured by the number of licensees , a direct outcome of the effect of the timing of a patent . Second , the current study provides new insights on the efﬁciency of a ﬁrm’s R & D invest - ment . While prior research has examined the optimal timing of R & D spending ( McGrath and Nerkar , 2004 ; Miller and Folta , 2002 ) , we ﬁll a gap in the extant research literature by examining how and why R & D investment inﬂuences innovation performance in differ - ent environmental contexts and under varying levels of inter - ﬁrm rivalry . 6 . 2 . Implications for practice Pioneering patents do not always lead to royalty generation . Rather , being a ‘fast follower’ may be a better strategic choice . Nonetheless , virtually every manager we met answered the ques - tion regarding the timing of the patent , “the faster the better” ; however , perhaps they mean the faster the better once they decided to ﬁle a patent . It may be unrealistic to believe the faster the bet - ter , because it implies that there are unlimited resources , which violates the ﬁrst element of strategy—i . e . , the allocation of scarce resources . Even large ﬁrms have resource constraints since they will have more alternative investment opportunities than smaller ﬁrms . Kogut and Kulatilaka ( 2001 ) also assert that a real - options heuristic is valuable in discerning the capabilities that provide the ﬂexibility in an uncertain environment , because an organization cannot expend all of its resources on search . R & D managers need to question the conventional wisdom that “the faster ﬁling the better . ” There can be costs or downsides of ﬁling patents early under certain conditions . Bunching the ﬁrm’s patents skewed toward the early stage of technological evolution cycle may not be as desirable in terms of business performance as spreading the patent ﬁlings . The - faster - the - better principle may be more advantageous when there is only one standard . In the context of multiple standards , however , it may be important to consider how many standards a patent can belong to . For this pur - pose , more information about a certain standard may be needed , which will increase as time passes , thus providing an advantage to waiting . Managers should get the organization ready to optimally manage the “window of opportunity . ” They need to foster orga - nizational agility which enables a ﬁrm to leverage technological spillover . They should equip the ﬁrm with a speedy decision making system and ﬂexible resource deployment / redeployment capability . Such ﬁrms would be able to respond to the changing conditions of patent pool formation . For example , when a patent pool put a ban on divisional applications for blue - ray technology , some ﬁrms were able to ﬁle many patents quickly before the enforcement . Moreover , ﬁrms can deploy human resources to expedite the ﬁling of impor - tant patents . Sometimes , for example , companies can dispatch their people to arrange interviews with patent examiners to clear up the issues in the process of patent examination . Meeting patent exam - iners in person would help ﬁrms to make them understand critical information about the patent and to communicate the direction of necessary corrections . Patent lawyers seeking legal protection and believing in pre - emptive moves may have great conﬁdence in the beneﬁt of the faster ﬁling . But , in practice , the rights afforded to patent holders are highly uncertain . Under patent law , a patent is no guarantee of exclusion but rather a legal right to try to exclude . Since only 0 . 1 % of all patents are litigated to trial , and since nearly half of fully litigated patents are declared invalid , this distinction is criti - cal to understanding the economic impact of patents ( Lemley and Shapiro , 2005 ) . Therefore , the management side should check the legal side . The current study is a patent - level analysis . A ﬁrm may have a strategy of staged investment and holding real options at various stages of the product life cycle . Given the uncertainty , accepting low revenue for early investment may not be a poor strategy ; it sim - ply may be part of the portfolio strategy that maximizes expected earnings . In addition , the current study highlights that , in a fast - changing industry with multiple standards , a ﬁrm needs to consider how to make a patent belong to multiple standards at the same time . Lemley and Sampat state : “Under optimally designed patent systems , the static social costs from the market power conferred by patents are offset by the dynamic welfare gains from increased invention and disclosure” ( 2012 , p . 817 ) . Patenting policy should be able to promote innovation , competition , and diffusion of tech - nology while protecting intellectual property . Inventors often ﬁle patent applications without a clear idea of whether the invention will be a commercial success simply to hedge their bets ( Lemley and Shapiro , 2005 ; Lerner , 2002 ) , which , according to our study’s results , can be costly in terms of not being able to generate eco - nomic rent ( via the number of licensees and ensuing royalty ) . This is on top of billions of dollars of direct patenting costs that inventors pay every year ( Lemley , 2001 ) . The government needs to establish a system that can ensure that the new innovation will be utilized by as many ﬁrms as possible . Since technological uncertainty cannot be controlled by the government , at least regulatory uncertainty may be attenuated so that the possibility of the patent pool getting approved can be known as early and clearly as possible . B . Kim et al . / Research Policy 45 ( 2016 ) 914 – 928 925 In addition , our empirical ﬁndings about the timing of ﬁling means that the government is likely to face a wave of applications within a short time frame around the creation of a patent pool , and delays in examination could cost inventors the opportunity to be reviewed for the pool . Finally , the US shifted from FTI to a FTF system in 2013 . This change of patenting system may have policy implications on how allowing patent pools affects ﬁrms’ incentives to invest in R & D and the accessibility of discoveries to society . 6 . 3 . Limitations and opportunities for future research Our theoretical reasoning and empirical ﬁndings have the fol - lowing limitations and therefore suggest directions for future research . First , we examined the number of licensees to patents in pools . We use the number of licensees as it may be the best available proxy for the economic value that companies may derive from the inventions , with an assumption that there is a probabil - ity of a patent with more licensees earning higher royalty income . However , additional revenues could come from other avenues such as independent licensing of the same patents in other domains . In future research , data on actual licensing revenues would clar - ify how much of innovation performance is due to the timing of the patent ﬁling versus other factors , such as the generalizability of the technology . A better measure of innovation performance would be based upon actual royalties , which would require access to pri - vate agreements , an accurate accounting of DVD discs that each licensee manufactured , and the number of cross - licenses among patentees in patent pools . However , this type of information is dif - ﬁcult , if not impossible , to obtain and is usually kept conﬁdential . In addition , a patent can earn royalties not only via patent pools but also from independent licensing activities ( Lerner and Tirole , 2004 ) , and independent licensing is encouraged under the DOJ regula - tions . Nevertheless , future research could be conducted with more elaborate royalty data . Another limitation is that our empirical results may only be gen - eralizable to FTI systems , and there might be systematic differences in patent timing between FTI and FTF systems . Our sample includes many patents ﬁled in the US by ﬁrms that are headquartered in FTF countries . Under FTF systems , ﬁrms may rush to ﬁle with fewer claims . We controlled for the number of claims in our selection equation . Also , we included country dummies as instrumental vari - ables for the timing of entry . We anticipated that , since the leading companies in the industry were in Japan and the Netherlands , there might be regional differences . The results show that , relative to ﬁrms in Japan ( the excluded category ) , the ﬁling dates for ﬁrms in Europe are earlier , and in Korea are later both before and after patent - pool formation , even though each has an FTF system , while there is no signiﬁcant difference in timing between US ( FTI ) and Japanese ( FTF ) ﬁrms . Moreover , examining the process of market acceptance would be a useful project . According to Wade ( 1995 ) , beyond the timing of a patent or technological superiority , the level of community - level networking and support for a certain technology is critical to the market entry success of a technology . Thus , the dynamics of communities based on sponsorship in DVD patent pools may inﬂu - ence royalties . We try to capture such an element by controlling the degree of involvement , but more research attention could be given to this important mechanism . In particular , ties between a spon - sor and other ﬁrms may inﬂuence how technological bandwagons develop . We also note that patents measure output rather than input into R & D efforts . There may be cases where a ﬁrm enters a technology domain but cannot or does not patent . Although we treated the pos - sible endogeneity problem and sample selection bias , our sample is a subset of the overall population we would have liked to examine . Whether the timing of a patent affects the invention’s success - ful transition to becoming an innovation may depend upon some intrinsic features of the patented invention such as its value and novelty . The current study does control for such features : techno - logical cycle time ( value ) , number of family patents ( value ) , and science linkage ( novelty ) . Further analyses of the inﬂuence of these variables on the number of licensees show that these variables have an impact on the dependent variable separately and in conjunction with one another . In future research studies on patent timing , the intrinsic features could be explicitly considered . Finally , Li et al . suggest that “real options are created and exer - cised at the discretion of managers . . . enabled and constrained by the resources and capabilities available to the organization” ( 2007 , p . 32 ) . This view was suggested but not directly addressed in the current study . We posit that patenting is an “intended” move . In other words , we interpreted our study’s result ( before patent - pool formation ) as indicating that late patents were intentionally ﬁled late in order to learn and reduce environmental uncertainty or to maintain secrecy . Future research studies should consider ﬁrm - level heterogeneity in resources and capabilities that may constrain patenting decisions ( Mahoney , 2005 ; Nelson and Winter , 1982 ) .

Appendix A . A . 1 . Context of the study : development of DVD Standards and Patent Pools Competing DVD standards evolved from previous standards and alliances in compact disc ( CD ) technology . Philips ( which owns a high percentage of CD - related patents ) and Sony sought to develop optical discs with more memory , based mostly on CD technology . The strong link to CDs is evident in the name of their standard : Multi - Media Compact Disc ( MMCD ) . Led by Toshiba , other corpo - rations challenged MMCD’s goal of dominance by developing an alternative standard , called Super Density ( SD ) . Toshiba’s exchange partners included Matsushita , Pioneer , Hitachi , Thomson , Time Warner , and MCA . Eventually , both camps found it advantageous to agree on a uniﬁed ( DVD - ROM ) standard in September 1995 . Within this standard , different products have emerged for different purposes and customers , including three playable standards ( DVD - ROM , DVD - Audio and DVD - Video ) and ﬁve recordable standards ( DVD - RAM , DVD - R , DVD + R , DVD - RW and DVD + RW ) . Behind the intense competition over technology standards was recognition of potentially large revenues from licensing royalties in addition to sales of DVD products . It was foreseeable that DVD devices would become a highly popular home - entertainment prod - uct , and therefore many companies were attracted economically to the DVD market . Firms also anticipated that intense competition in manufacturing and selling of end products would result in unsta - ble income streams , adversely impacting proﬁtability of sales of DVD discs . As a result , all of the DVD device manufacturers also focused on the potential to earn royalty income from owning the essential technology . Patent pools often have two key character - istics : ﬁrst , multiple companies’ patent rights are collected under an independent , central entity , which in the US usually takes the 926 B . Kim et al . / Research Policy 45 ( 2016 ) 914 – 928 form of a partnership or limited - liability company . This company licenses technologies by bundling multiple patents into a package . Second , patent pools determine the value of patents and allocate the royalty income from licensing to patentees in the pool . Patent pools consist of contractual relationships where com - peting patentees transfer their patent rights to a single entity that then grants permission to use the patents . For each of the essential patents to be included in a pool , the patent must be evaluated by an independent examiner ( Gilbert , 2004 ) . The exam - iner determines the ‘essentiality’ of these patents and selects or rejects patents for inclusion based on their scientiﬁc and commer - cial importance ( Gilbert , 2004 ; Joshi and Nerkar , 2011 ) . To promote pro - competitive behavior , the Department of Justice ( DOJ ) requires that the examiner is to ensure the patents that represent comple - mentary knowledge assets to be included in the pool , while those that represent potential substitute knowledge assets to be excluded ( Merges , 1999 ) . 17 Further , the patents included in the pool must be made available to all prospective licensees on a reasonable and nondiscriminatory basis ( Shapiro , 2000 ) . Two patent pools – DVD 3C and DVD 6C – emerged in the DVD industry . First , Philips , Sony , and Pioneer organized the DVD 3C Licensing Agency on December 16 , 1998 . It became DVD 4C when LG Electronics joined the patent pool in July 2003 . 7C originated as DVD 6C in June 1999 with Matsushita ( Panasonic ) , Mitsubishi , Hitachi , Time Warner , Toshiba , and JVC as the original exchange partners . It became DVD 7C when IBM joined in June 2003 . In DVD patent pools , each ﬁrm belongs to one patent pool exclusively . When a ﬁrm decides which patent pool it should join , it considers the beneﬁt from the interdependence of patents among players in the patent pool and the licensing activities of the leading company . As shown in Table 1 , patent ﬁlings gradually increase at an accel - erating rate until they peak in 1999 and subside thereafter . Most patenting activities take place around the time of standard setting and subsequent patent - pool formation . The cumulative frequency in the technology domain resembles the standard S - curve of entry and exit patterns in product markets ( Agarwal et al . , 2002 ; Suarez and Utterback , 1995 ) . Appendix B . To specify the selection equation , we consider factors that affect entry into patent pools . First , a patent is a collection of claims ( Tong and Frame , 1994 ) . McGrath and Nerkar submit that “a claim is the actual contribution made by the invention” ( 2002 , p . 9 ) . Therefore , the potential application areas for a patent increase with the num - ber of claims ( Lanjouw and Schankerman , 1999 ) . More application areas imply more potential licensees , and ﬁrms use patent pools to reduce the transaction costs of licensing . Thus , we suggest that , at the patent level , as a patent has more claims , its assignee ﬁrm is more likely to enter it into patent pools . Second , at the organi - zation level , the older the organization is , the more likely it is to enter patent pools . Lastly , at the organization level , organizations with larger size are more likely to enter patent pools . We mea - sured the inverse Mills ratio from the selection equation to predict the probability of entering patent pools . We plugged this ratio in the second - stage regression . In examining and correcting the possible bias , we expand our data pool to include the patents which belong to the three - digit technological class of patents related to DVD disc technology , but not to the DVD patent pools . These are technological classes such as television ( 348 ) , facsimile and static presentation processing 17 From a public policy perspective , the independent examiner’s role needs to be strengthened in determining the validity of the inventions as well as the technolog - ical and commercial potential .

We ﬁnd 7189 additional patents that are in the same techno - logical classes as our sample patents but not in the patent pools . Including our original sample , the total number of observation increases to 7869 patents . In our selection equation of Heckman’s ( 1979 ) two - step procedure , the dependent variable was set to 1 if a ﬁrm entered a patent pool , otherwise , 0 . We performed a logit regression on the expanded sample to calculate an inverse Mills ratio . The result of logit estimates from the ﬁrst stage of Heckman’s ( 1979 ) two - step procedure is presented in Table B1 . The empiri - cal result shows that claims , ﬁrm age , and ﬁrm size have a positive relationship with an organization’s decision to enter a patent pool . In addition , we ﬁnd that the coefﬁcient of inverse Mills ratio is not statistically signiﬁcant in the second - stage regression ( Table B2 ) . Therefore , we exclude this ratio in our ﬁnal models ( Table 3 ) . Results are unchanged when using a probit model for the ﬁrst stage . References Agarwal , R . , Sarkar , M .
