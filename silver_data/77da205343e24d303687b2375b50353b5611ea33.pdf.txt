US and Non - US Submissions An Analysis of Reviewer Bias Ann M . Link , MA Context . — Reviewersincreasinglyareaskedtoreviewmanuscriptsfromoutside their own country , but whether they are more likely to recommend acceptance of such manuscripts is not known . Objective . — To assess whether US reviewers or non - US reviewers evaluate manuscripts differently , depending on whether the manuscripts are submitted from outside the United States or from the United States . Design and Setting . — A retrospective analysis of all original submissions received byGastroenterologyin 1995 and 1996 . Reviewers ranked manuscripts in 4 decision categories : accept , provisionally accept , reject with resubmission , or re - ject . Main Outcome Measure . — Ranking of papers based on nationality of authors and reviewers . Results . — The percentage of non - US manuscripts placed in each decision cat - egory by US ( n = 2355 ) and non - US reviewers ( n = 1297 ) was nearly identical ( P = . 31 ) . However , US reviewers recommended acceptance of papers submitted by US authors more often than did non - US reviewers ( P = . 001 ) . Non - US review - ers ranked US papers slightly more favorably than non - US papers ( P = . 09 ) , while US reviewers ranked US papers much more favorably ( P = . 001 ) . Conclusions . — Reviewers from the United States and outside the United States evaluate non - US papers similarly and evaluate papers submitted by US authors more favorably , with US reviewers having a signiﬁcant preference for US papers . JAMA . 1998 ; 280 : 246 - 247 MANY US journals cite increased num - bersofinternationalsubmissions . 1 - 3 Sev - enty percent of submissions to Gastro - enterology are from outside the United States . However , non - US submissions are less likely to be published based on peer review . These data prompted a study assessing whether US and non - US reviewers evaluate manuscripts submittedto Gastroenterology fromout - sidetheUSdifferentlythanmanuscripts submitted from US - based authors . METHODS Using a manuscript tracking data - base , a retrospective study was con - ducted of original research articles sub - mitted to Gastroenterology during 1995 and 1996 . Manuscripts not sent out for peer review and revised manuscripts were excluded . The corresponding au - thor’s nationality , each reviewer’s na - tionality , andeachreviewer’srankingof the paper were obtained . Reviewers who did not indicate a decision ranking were excluded . Decision rankings of pa - pers were obtained from the reviewer forms . Theseformsaskreviewerstorec - ommend one of the following decisions on a paper : accept , provisionally accept , reject with resubmission , or reject . Two nonblinded reviewers are asked to re - view each paper . Authorsandreviewerswereidentified as either “US” or “non - US . ” Reviews were tabulated according to author na - tionality , reviewer nationality , and re - viewer ranking combinations . Compari - sons of reviewer recommendations and reviewers’ nationality were assessed us - ing the x 2 test for independence ( with 3 df ) . Reviewer recommendations and ori - ginofthepaperwereanalyzedinthesamemanner . RESULTS Internationalpaperswereassessedto determine if they were ranked differ - ently by US and non - US reviewers . Therewere2355USreviewersand1297 non - US reviewers of non - US papers . Thepercentagesofinternationalpapers placed in each decision category by US and non - US reviewers were similar , in - dicating no significant correlation be - tween a reviewers’ nationality and the ranking of international papers ( accept : 3 . 6 % vs3 . 2 % ; provisionallyaccept : 24 . 9 % vs 24 . 7 % ; reject with resubmission : 26 . 8 % vs 24 . 6 % ; reject : 44 . 7 % vs 47 . 6 % ) ( P = . 31 ) . Next , USpaperswereanalyzedtode - termine if there were differences in US and non - US reviewers’ rankings . There were 1174 US reviewers and 449 non - US reviewers of US papers .

Data were analyzed to determine whether these findings indicated bias . Reviewers’ evaluations were examined to determine whether US reviewers evaluated non - US and US papers simi - larly . This process was also used to de - termine whether non - US reviewers evaluate the 2 sets of papers similarly . Non - US reviewers rank papers submit - ted from the United States more favor - ably ( accept : 3 . 6 % vs 3 . 2 % ; provisionally accept : 30 . 5 % vs 24 . 7 % ; reject with re - submission : 21 . 6 % vs 24 . 6 % ; reject : 44 . 3 % vs 47 . 6 % ; P = . 09 ) . Moreover , US reviewers show a stronger preference for US papers than non - US reviewers ( accept : 7 . 0 % vs 3 . 6 % ; provisionally ac - cept : 31 . 3 % vs 24 . 9 % ; reject with resub - mission : 26 . 1 % vs26 . 8 % ; reject : 35 . 6 % vs 44 . 7 % ; P = . 001 ) . Based on logistic regression looking simultaneously at reviewer nationality and manuscript source , the data show that the manuscript source was signifi - cant ( P = . 001 ) , with domestic papers having an odds ratio of 1 . 49 for back - ground of review and background of ac - ceptance , while the reviewer’s national - ity was not significant ( P = . 22 ) ( Table ) . COMMENT Several factors prevent conclusive findings on international bias in this study . First , non - US reviewers were pooled because there were not enough authors and reviewers from the same countrytoobtainstatisticallysignificantresults . Second , nationality was based on the corresponding author’s location ratherthanactualnationality . Third , as - sociate editors may choose non - US re - veiwers who have similiar training and viewpoints ; however , data regarding lo - cation of training were not available . Fourth , reviewers were not blinded . Most important , bias cannot be un - equivocally inferred without measuring the quality of individual papers . Still , this study does provide insights into po - tential variability in manuscript evalua - tions across national lines and lends it - self to further investigation and more complex studies .

Objective . — To identify deﬁciencies in the quality of reporting of placebo - controlled randomized trials published in German or English . Design . — Observational study comparing 32 German - and 89 English - language reportsofplacebo - controlledtrialswithparalleldesign , publishedbythesamegroup of authors between 1985 and 1994 . Main Outcome Measure . — High reporting quality , deﬁned as adherence to published standards and measured by an 18 - item scale based on 2 standard guidelines . Results . — The mean quality score was 8 . 4 ( SD , 3 . 0 ; range , 1 - 16 ) of 18 . The dif - ference of the mean quality scores between English - language reports compared with German - language reports was small ( 0 . 27 ; 95 % conﬁdence interval , −0 . 97 to 1 . 52 ) . More articles reported clinical aspects than trial methods or statistics . Conclusion . — There is room for improvement in the reporting of placebo - controlled randomized trials for both English and German reports .
