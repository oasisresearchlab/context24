In this study , we first investigate that the absence of miR - 182 - 5p in human bladder cancer promotes tumor growth by regulating the expression of Cofilin 1 , an actin modulating - protein . Methods : Human bladder tumor tissue specimens were collected to detect the expression of miR - 182 - 5p and Cofilin 1 by qRT - PCR . Luciferase activity assay was performed to demonstrate the regulation of Cofilin 1 mRNA 3 ′ UTR by miR - 182 - 5p . Then , cell experiments were performed to analysis the effect of miR - 182 - 5p / Cofilin 1 pathway on tumor cell proliferation , migration , invasion and colony forming efficiency . Finally , xenograft tumor models were established to evaluate the role of miR - 182 - 5p in tumorigenesis abilities in vivo . Results : qRT - PCR and Western blotting analysis showed that Cofilin 1 expression was up - regulated in both blad - der cancer tissues and cell lines compared with normal . Luciferase activity assay showed that miR - 182 - 5p specifically targets Cofilin 1 mRNA 3 ′ UTR and represses the expression of Cofilin 1 . Also , miR - 182 - 5p inhibited bladder tumor cell proliferation , migration , invasion and colony forming efficiency . Furthermore , xenograft tumor model assay showed that miR - 182 - 5p plays a negative role in bladder cancer tumorigenesis abilities in vivo . Conclusion : Present results suggest that miR - 182 - 5p could inhibit human bladder tumor growth by repressing Cofi - lin 1 expression . Our findings may provide a new horizon for exploring therapeutic target of bladder cancer .

Background According to the global cancer statistics from 2018 , bladder cancer caused estimated 549 393 new cases and 199 , 922 death in the year 2018 . As the tenth most com - mon cancer in the world , bladder cancer has an over 75 % occurring in men . Smoking is the most determined risk factor for bladder cancer [ 1 , 2 ] . MicroRNAs ( miRNAs ) are endogenous approximate 22 nt in length RNAs that can suppress target gene mRNA translation by sufficient or partial complemen - tarity to 3 ′ UTR of the mRNA [ 3 ] . miRNAs play crucial roles in multiple bio - progress , including cell prolifera - tion , cell differentiation and cell death [ 4 – 6 ] . Further - more , increasing studies showed that miRNAs have an intertwined pathway regulation in various human can - cers by acting as tumor suppressors or oncogenes [ 7 , 8 ] . miR - 182 - 5p is a member of miR - 183 / 96 / 182 cluster , and locates in the chromosome 7q31 - 34 . In diverse kinds of tumors , miR - 182 - 5p plays an implicated role through acting as a tumor suppressor or oncogene . Specifically , miR - 182 - 5p act as tumor suppressor in renal cell cancer Open Access Cancer Cell International * Correspondence : haikuoyiyuan @ 163 . com ; 13698987211 @ 163 . com † Fei Wang , Dinglan Wu and Zhanping Xu equally contributed to this work 1 Department of Urology , Hainan General Hospital , Haikou , China 7 Central Laboratory , Affiliated Haikou Hospital Xiangya School of Medicine Central South University ( HaiKou Municipal People Hospital ) , Haikou , Hainan , ChinaFull list of author information is available at the end of the article Page 2 of 10 Wang et al . Cancer Cell Int ( 2019 ) 19 : 42 ( RCC ) [ 9 ] , non - small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) [ 10 , 11 ] , osteosarcoma ( OS ) [ 12 ] and glioblastoma [ 13 ] . On the other hand , miR - 182 - 5p is considered as oncogene in breast cancer [ 14 ] , ovarian cancer [ 15 ] and prostate can - cer [ 16 ] . Cofilin 1 , a 19 kDa ubiquitous actin - modulating pro - tein , is encoded by the non - muscle isoform of CFL1 ( Gene ID : 1072 ) . It’s one of the three ADFs / Cofilin 1 , including Cofilin 1 , Cofilin 2 and ADF . Cofilin 1 is widely expressed in almost all mammal cell types , Cofi - lin 2 is mainly expressed in muscle tissues , and ADFs is expressed in brain and epithelial tissues [ 17 ] . Cofilin 1 acts as an important mediator of cell movement by controlling actin dynamics during cell protrusion [ 18 , 19 ] . Since enhanced cell survival , metastasis and inva - sion extensively exist in tumor cell , activity of Cofilin 1 , affected by expression level , phosphorylation level , pH and subcellular localization , closely correlates with tumo - rigenesis and tumor development [ 20 , 21 ] . It has reported that an increasing expression of Cofilin 1 is observed in 70 % prostate cancers , and expression of Cofilin 1 is sug - gested as an independent predictive factor [ 22 ] . Further - more , Liu et al . [ 23 ] have showed that LMO2 enhances Cofilin 1 activity through inhibiting phosphorylation of Cofilin 1 by LIMK1 , which ultimately promotes tumor cell invasion and metastasis in breast cancers . Therefore , Cofilin 1 may become a new potential tumor marker and target for treatment of malignant tumor [ 24 – 26 ] . In our earlier study , we found that Cofilin 1 expresses much higher in human bladder cancer tissues than para - tumor tissues , and suppressing Cofilin 1 by siRNA can inhibit tumor cell growth . Furthermore , we found that transcription factor 7 - like 2 ( TCF7L2 ) enhances Cofilin 1 expression by binding to Cofilin 1 promoter in human bladder cancer , which can promote tumor progress [ 25 , 27 ] . Here , we expect to further explore the role of Cofilin 1 regulated by miR - 182 - 5p in bladder cancer . Meanwhile we found that miR - 182 - 5p can direct targets Cofilin 1 mRNA 3 ′ UTR , and regulate the expression of Cofilin 1 in bladder cancer . The loss of miR - 182 - 5p in bladder cancer induced a high level of Cofilin 1 , which promoted tumor cell proliferation , migration and invasion and tumorigen - esis abilities . The miR - 182 - 5p / Cofilin 1 regulating axis reveals another potential mechanism of bladder cancer tumorigenesis .

Cancer Cell Int ( 2019 ) 19 : 42 Statistical analysis Data in this study were analyzed and exhibited using Origin 8 . 5 ( OriginLab , USA ) software and shown as mean ± SD .

Results Cofilin 1 is up‑regulated in human bladder cancer tissues and cell lines We firstly measured the expression of Cofilin 1 in human bladder cancer tissues and cell lines . In eight human blad - der cancer tissue samples , Cofilin 1 mRNA expression remarkably increased compared with homologous para - cancer tissues ( Fig . 1a ) . Similarly , Western blotting anal - ysis revealed a higher Cofilin 1 protein level in bladder cancer tissues than in adjacent normal tissues ( Fig . 1b ) . Furthermore , we determined Cofilin 1 expression in two human bladder cancer cell lines , RT4 and T24 . Compared with bladder epithelial cells , Cofilin 1 expressed much higher in RT4 and T24 cells both in mRNA and protein level ( Fig . 1c , d ) . These data suggest that the high expres - sion of Cofilin 1 in human bladder cancer correlates to bladder tumorigenesis . miR‑182‑5p direct targets Cofilin 1 mRNA 3 ′ UTR and regulates gene expression miR - 182 - 5p plays an important role in various kinds of tumors by participating in multiple cell signal pathways [ 10 , 12 , 28 ] . First , professional share databases ( Targets - canHuman and PicTar ) were used to predict target genes of miR - 182 - 5p . CFL1 was one of miR - 182 - 5p predicted target genes , and had a relative good efficiency score of prediction ( Fig . 2a ) . To further confirm miR - 182 - 5p targeting gene CFL1 , wild and mutant Cofilin 1 mRNA 3 ′ TUR were respectively constructed into psi - CHECK2 vector ( Fig . 2b ) , then luciferase activity assay was per - formed . In wt - Cofilin 1 - 3 ′ UTR group , luciferase activity was markedly repressed by miR - 182 - 5p mimics transfec - tion , and promoted by miR - 182 - 5p inhibitor transfection . However , the luciferase activity have no significant differ - ence compared with control group when either promot - ing or interference miR - 182 - 5p expression in mut - Cofilin 1 – 3 ′ UTR groups ( p > 0 . 05 ) ( Fig . 2c ) . In RT4 cells , Cofilin 1 mRNA expression was down - regulated with miR - 182 - 5p mimics transfection , and up - regulated with miR - 182 - 5p inhibitor transfection ( Fig . 2d ) . All these results indicate that miR - 182 - 5p can negatively regulate Cofilin 1 expres - sion by binding to gene 3 ′ UTR at position 135 – 142 . miR‑182‑5p is down‑regulated in human bladder cancer tissues and cell lines miR - 182 - 5p level was measured in 8 human bladder can - cer tissue samples by qRT - PCR . The results showed that expression of miR - 182 - 5p was decreased in bladder can - cer tissues compared with homologous para - tumor tis - sues ( Fig . 2f ) . Similarly , miR - 182 - 5p expression reduced in both RT4 and T24 cells compared with normal blad - der epithelial cells ( Fig . 2e ) . These results indicate that low level of miR - 182 - 5p contributes to an up - regulation expression of Cofilin 1 in bladder cancer cells . miR‑182‑5p reduces bladder cancer cell proliferation through promoting Cofilin 1 Since miR - 182 - 5p could direct targets Cofilin 1 mRNA 3 ′ UTR , we next observed the Cofilin 1 level after miR - 182 - 5p mimics , miR - 182 - 5p inhibitor , Cofilin 1 and miR - 182 - 5p mimics + Cofilin 1 transfection in RT4 Fig . 1 Cofilin 1 upregulates in bladder tumor tissues and cell lines . a Cofilin 1 mRNA expression in bladder tumor and homologous para - tumor tissues were measured by qRT - PCR . b Cofilin 1 protein expression in bladder tumor ( T ) and homologous para - tumor ( N ) tissues were measured by Western blotting . c , d Cofilin 1 mRNA and protein expression in bladder cancer cell lines ( RT4 and T24 ) and normal bladder epithelial cell line ( SV - Huc - 1 ) measured by qRT - PCR and Western blotting . * * Indicates p < 0 . 01 , * * * indicates p < 0 . 001 Page 5 of 10 Wang et al . Cancer Cell Int ( 2019 ) 19 : 42 cells by Western blotting . The results showed that miR - 182 - 5p plays a negative role in regulating Cofilin 1 , and the overexpression of Cofilin 1 could be partly reverted by miR - 182 - 5p co - transfection ( Fig . 3a ) . In CCK8 assay , cell proliferation was inhibited by miR - 182 - 5p mim - ics transfection , and promoted by miR - 182 - 5p inhibi - tor transfection . Cofilin 1 transfection could remarkably promote RT4 and T24 cell proliferation , however , this promotion effect was counteracted by miR - 182 - 5p co - expression ( p < 0 . 0001 ) ( Fig . 3b ) . In cell cycle assay , miR - 182 - 5p expression blocked cells at G1 phase of cell cycle , in contrast , miR - 182 - 5p inhibitor transfection increased the cell percentage of S and G2 phase . Cofilin 1 expres - sion could significantly promote cells to transfer from G1 to S and G2 phase . Also , this promotion effect was coun - teracted by miR - 182 - 5p co - expression ( Fig . 3c – f ) . These data suggest that the loss of miR - 182 - 5p in bladder can - cer cell can promote cell proliferation viability by acceler - ating Cofilin 1 expression . miR‑182‑5p represses bladder cancer cell migration , invasion and colony formation ability through promoting Cofilin 1 Next , the influence of miR - 182 - 5p and Cofilin 1 on RT4 and T24 cell migration and invasion were evaluated using trans - well membrane . Compared with control and blank ( RT4 and T24 ) groups , miR - 182 - 5p mimics trans - fection suppressed cell migration and invasion , Cofilin 1 expression and miR - 182 - 5p inhibition enhanced the ability of cell migration and invasion . While miR - 182 - 5p and Cofilin 1 was co - expressed , the number of migra - tion and invasion cells had no significant difference compared with control and blank groups ( Fig . 4a , b ) . In colony formation assay , miR - 182 - 5p inhibition and Cofi - lin 1 expression had a higher colony forming efficiency than control and blank groups . miR - 182 - 5p mimics and Cofilin 1 co - transfection converted the colony form - ing ability to normal level ( p > 0 . 01 ) ( Fig . 4c ) . Thus , the low level of miR - 182 - 5p in bladder cancer also facilitate Fig . 2 miR - 182 - 5p direct targets Cofilin 1 mRNA 3 ′ UTR . a TargetscanHuman 7 . 2 analysis showed that Cofilin 1 mRNA 3 ′ UTR contains a predicted miR - 182 - 5p binding site at position 135 - 142 . b Wt - Cofilin1 - 3 ′ UTR sequence complementarity to miR - 182 - 5p at position 135 - 142 , and Mut - Cofilin1 - 3 ′ UTR has a mutant at miR - 182 - 5p binding site . c Relative luciferase activity was measured after miR - 182 mimics , miR - inhibitor , wt - Cofilin 1 - 3 ′ UTR - psi - CHECK - 2 and mut - Cofilin 1 - 3 ′ UTR - psi - CHECK - 2 plasmids transfection . d Cofilin 1 mRNA expression was measured after miR - 182 mimics and Cofilin 1 expression plasmids transfection by qRT - PCR . e miR - 182 mRNA level was measured in bladder tumor and homologous para - tumor tissues by qRT - PCR . f miR - 182 expression level was measured in bladder cancer cell lines ( RT4 and T24 ) and normal bladder epithelial cell line ( SV - Huc - 1 ) measured by qRT - PCR . * * Indicates p < 0 . 01 , * * * indicates p < 0 . 001 Page 6 of 10 Wang et al .

Effects of miR‑182‑5p on xenograft tumor growth in nude mice For further investigating the functions of miR - 182 - 5p in bladder cancer , xenograft tumor assay was performed . miR - 182 - 5p mimics , miR - 182 - 5p inhibitor and Cofilin 1 expression vectors transfected RT4 cells were injected into nude mice , then , tumor volume was determined every few days . The results showed that xenograft tumor volume and growth of miR - 182 - 5p inhibitor and Cofilin 1 groups were obviously increased compared with con - trol ( RT4 , p < 0 . 05 ) ( Fig . 5c ) . On day 44 , xenograft tumors were excised to weigh ( Fig . 5a ) . Also , xenograft tumor of miR - 182 - 5p inhibitor and Cofilin 1 groups are more weight than control ( p < 0 . 01 ) ( Fig . 5b ) . No significant dif - ference of xenograft tumor weight was observed between miR - 182 - 5p mimics and control groups ( p > 0 . 05 ) . But , paired - samples t - test statistical analysis in samples that tumor volume on day 4 to day 44 showed that there is a significant statistical difference ( p = 0 . 0009 ) between miR - 182 mimics and control groups . So we considered that miR - 182 mimics transfection can suppresses tumor growth in xenografts ( Fig . 5c ) . Discussion With the increasing and aging of population , cancer has growing incidence and mortality worldwide , and has become a heavy burden on society especially in Fig . 3 miR - 182 inhibits bladder cancer cell growth through repressing Cofilin 1 . a Cofilin 1 expression was measured by Western blotting after miR - 182 mimics , miR - 182inhibitor and Cofilin 1 vectors transfection in RT4 cells . b Cell proliferation were determined by CCK - 8 assay after miR - 182 mimics , miR - 182 inhibitor and Cofilin 1 plasmids transfection in RT4 and T24 cells . c , d Cell cycle was determined after miR - 182 mimics , miR - 182 inhibitor and Cofilin 1 vectors transfection in RT4 and T24 cells . e , f Data analysis of cell cycle in RT4 and T24 cells . * Indicates p < 0 . 05 , * * indicates p < 0 . 01 , * * * indicates p < 0 . 001 Page 7 of 10 Wang et al . Cancer Cell Int ( 2019 ) 19 : 42 developing countries . Human bladder cancer is one of the most common cancer with an incident of 549 , 393 in the year 2018 [ 2 ] . Not smoking , schistosomiasis controlling , more fruit , vegetables taking in and proper treatment are the major prevention measures for bladder cancer [ 29 ] . Cofilin 1 , belongs to the actin depolymerizing fac - tor ( ADF ) , is a ubiquitous protein that binds to actin , participates in directed cell movement in response to chemoattractant or stimulation by involving in actin dynamics at plasma membrane during cell protrusion [ 18 , 30 , 31 ] . Also , Kanellos et al . [ 32 ] indicated that Cofi - lin 1 involves in maintaining tissue homeostasis and promoting cell survival by preventing the cell nucleus from being damaged by actin contractility . In our study , we found that expression of Cofilin 1 accelerates tumor cell proliferation and decreases cells of G1 - arrested . So we consider that Cofilin 1 accelerate cell proliferation mainly through enhancing stress tolerance of cells and promoting movement into the beneficial environment . In cancer cells , Cofilin 1 activity , which is affected by fac - tors of phosphorylation level , pH , subcellular localization and binding of phosphoinositides , is necessary for tumor cell motility and invasion . Notably , LIM kinase 1 ( LMK1 ) , which can phosphorylates and inactivates Cofilin 1 , and Cofilin 1 were simultaneously increased in invasive cells [ 33 ] . Interfering the expression of Cofilin 1 in cancer cell inhibit cell invasion by weaken the maturation and sta - bility of invadopodia [ 34 ] . Wang et al . [ 35 ] reported that Cofilin 1 overexpressed in invasive subpopulation of can - cer cells from the primary tumor . In bladder cancer , Pat - rick et al . [ 36 ] proved that with the increasing of tumor grade , Cofilin 1 expression was significant elevated , and localization of Cofilin 1 to nucleus also increased . How - ever , the mechanism of Cofilin 1 up - regulated in cancer cells was not presented in these studies . In our earlier study , we reported that transcription factor TCF7L2 Fig . 4 miR - 182 inhibits bladder cancer cell migration , invasion and colony forming efficiency through repressing Cofilin 1 . a , b Cell migration and invasion were measured by using trans - well membrane and crystal violet staining after transfection of miR - 182 mimics , miR - 182 inhibitor and Cofilin 1 expression vectors in RT4 and T24 cells . c Cell colony forming efficiency was measured after transfection of miR - 182 mimics , miR - 182 inhibitor and Cofilin 1 expression vectors in RT4 and T24 cells . * * Indicates p < 0 . 01 Page 8 of 10 Wang et al . Cancer Cell Int ( 2019 ) 19 : 42 can binds to Cofilin 1 promoter and increases the gene expression in bladder cancer , which promotes the tumor progress [ 25 , 27 ] . Here , we found another regulated path - way by miR - 182 - 5p that can elevate levels of Cofilin 1 in tumor cells . It is well known that miRNAs have close correlation with tumorigenesis through participating in multiple bio - process , including cell proliferation , migration , invasion and apoptosis [ 7 , 37 , 38 ] . As a member of miR - 183 fam - ily , miR - 182 - 5p plays a key and complex role in diverse kinds of tumors by acting as oncogene and tumor sup - pressor . For instance , miR - 182 - 5p inhibits renal cell can - cer ( RCC ) cell proliferation , invasion and apoptosis by regulating PI3K / AKT / mTOR pathway [ 9 ] ; miR - 182 - 5p suppresses non - small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) cell pro - liferation , invasion and invadopodia formation by target - ing cortical , an actin - associated protein [ 10 , 39 ] ; miR - 182 reduces proliferation of human osteosarcoma cell ( OS ) by targeting HOXA9 [ 12 ] ; miR - 182 acts as an oncogene and promote hepatocellular cancer ( HCC ) progression by targeting FOXO3a [ 40 ] ; In gastric adenocarcinoma , miR - 182 inhibit tumor growth by targeting cAMP respon - sive element binding protein 1 ( CREB1 ) [ 41 ] . Due to the numerous miR - 182 target genes , the mechanisms of miR - 182 involving in tumorigenesis is quite complex , even be inconsistent . At present , the research about miR - 182 - 5p functions in human bladder cancer is rare , and the mech - anism involved in is unclear . Fig . 5 The effect of miR - 182 on RT4 xenograft tumor growth , volume and weight . a On day 44 , the RT4 xenograft mice were executed by cervical dislocation , and tumors were excised to weigh . Scale bar , 1 cm . b Tumor weight was measured on day 44 . c Tumor growth and volume in RT4 xenograft model were determined every few days . * * Indicates p < 0 . 01 Page 9 of 10 Wang et al . Cancer Cell Int ( 2019 ) 19 : 42 In this study , we demonstrated that Cofilin 1 is over - expressed in human bladder cancer tissues and cell lines compared with normal tissues or epithelial cells , which is consistent with our earlier research [ 25 , 27 ] . miR - 214 - 5p direct targets Cofilin 1 mRNA 3 ′ UTR and regu - lates the gene expression . Therefore , decline expression of miR - 182 - 5p contributes to the high level of Cofilin 1 in bladder cancer , for which enhanced the tumor cell proliferation , migration and invasion and tumorigenesis abilities . In xenograft mice model assay , miR - 182 - 5p inhi - bition observably increased the xenograft tumor growth compared with control . Also , miR - 182 - 5p mimics trans - fection is able to suppress the xenograft tumor growth . Conclusions We first proved that Cofilin 1 is a direct target of miR - 182 - 5p in human bladder cancer . Following with the demonstrating of TCF7L2 / Cofilin 1 regulating path - way in bladder cancer , we uncovered another regulating mechanism of which Cofilin 1 promoting tumor pro - gress through miR - 182 - 5p / Cofilin 1 regulating axis . Loss of miR - 182 - 5p in bladder cancer can promotes Cofilin 1 expression , which may have a potential diagnostic and targeted therapy value for bladder cancer .
