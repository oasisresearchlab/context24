REVI E W Open Access Rab - mediated vesicle trafficking in cancer Hong - Tai Tzeng 1 and Yi - Ching Wang 1 , 2 * Abstract A large group of small Rab GTPases which mediate secretory and endosomal membrane transport , as well as autophagosome biogenesis , are essential components of vesicle trafficking machinery . Specific Rab protein together with the cognate effectors coordinates the dynamics of trafficking pathway and determines the cargo proteins destination . Functional impairments of Rab proteins by mutations or post - translational modifications disrupting the regulatory network of vesicle trafficking have been implicated in tumorigenesis . Therefore , the vesicle transport regulators play essential roles in the mediation of cancer cell biology , including uncontrolled cell growth , invasion and metastasis . The context - dependent role of the same Rab to act as either an oncoprotein or tumor suppressor in different cancers is found . Such discrepancies may be due in part to the interaction of specific Rab protein with different effectors or cargos in various tumors . Here , we review recent advances in the roles of Rab GTPases in communicating with other effectors in tumor progression . In this review , we also emphasize dysregulation of Rab - mediated membrane delivery shifting normal cell behaviors toward malignancy . Thus , recovery of the dysregulated vesicle trafficking systems in cancer cells may provide future directions for potential strategy to restrain tumor progression . Keywords : Rab protein , Effector , Vesicle trafficking , Cancer Background Rab proteins are evolutionarily conserved with 55 – 75 % identity across species . They are small GTPases compris - ing more than 70 members in humans and function as regulators of vesicles transport , proteins trafficking , mem - brane targeting and fusion [ 1 – 3 ] . Rab protein activity is controlled by cycling between the active GTP - bound and inactive GDP - bound forms . Guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEFs ) serve as the effectors of Rab GTPase by facilitating the exchange of GDP for GTP , resulting in the activation of Rabs and the downstream signaling [ 4 ] . In contrast , GTPase - activating proteins ( GAPs ) catalyze the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP to convert the GTP - bound Rabs to inactive GDP - bound form [ 5 ] . Some Rab small GTPases localize to the cytosol by forming complex with guanine dissociation inhibitors ( GDIs ) that prevent their membrane anchorage . Other effectors such as motor proteins , tethering factors and SNAREs ( Soluble N - ethylmaleimide sensitive factor attachment protein re - ceptor ) are involved in the coordination of Rabs - mediated vesicle transport from donor membrane budding toward acceptor membrane fusion [ 6 – 8 ] . Dysregulation in Rabs level or mutations altering GTP / GDP - binding of Rabs or Rabs interaction with effectors may dampen the efficiency and specificity in membrane traffic that are implicated in disease development such as cancer . In recent years , advanced progress in understanding the cellular functions of Rabs on vesicle trafficking has been made . Therefore , this review provides an overview of our current knowledge of regulation of Rab - mediated vesicle dynamics , and their critical roles in tumorigenesis . Rab GTPases function as molecular switches in membrane traffic Over the past two decades , emerging evidence has shown that distinct classes of small GTPases are in - volved in membrane vesicles trafficking . Individual Rab protein localizes to the surface membrane of different organelle in the cytosolic compartment and regulates a specific membrane trafficking pathway for appropriate protein sorting and targeting . Most Rabs are expressed ubi - quitously , while some have tissue / cell - type specificity .

Tzeng and Wang Journal of Biomedical Science ( 2016 ) 23 : 70 DOI 10 . 1186 / s12929 - 016 - 0287 - 7 example , Rab17 is predominantly expressed in epithelial cells and localized to apical recycling endosome ( ARE ) to mediate transcytosis to the basolateral plasma membrane [ 9 ] . Rab15 and Rab25 are also involved in the transporta - tion of cargos through the ARE system [ 10 , 11 ] . Rab12 is highly expressed in Sertoli cells and is responsible for the cargo delivery from peripheral to the perinuclear region to maintain centrosomes integrity [ 12 ] . Rab10 is expressed in adipocytes and implicated in mediating insulin - stimulated plasma membrane translocation of glucose transporter GLUT4 [ 13 ] . Rab8A and Rab13 are expressed in skeletal muscle cells and become active forms in response to insu - lin stimulation [ 14 ] . Some Rabs localize at different subcellular organelles . For instance , localization of Rab33 at the medial Golgi helps in the intra - Golgi transportation of vesicles [ 15 ] . Rab5 and Rab21 are involved in early endosome transport and mediate endocytosis pathway while Rab7 regulates cargo trafficking from early endosome to late endosome and subsequently to lysosome for degradation [ 16 – 18 ] . Another vesicle transport route is from trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) to the plasma membrane , which is mediated by secretory granules and vesicles . A lot of Rab proteins are associated with exocytic pathway including Rab3 , Rab11 , Rab26 , Rab27 , Rab37 and Rab38 [ 19 – 24 ] . Vesicles transport between TGN and early endosome are controlled by Rab22 and Rab31 [ 25 , 26 ] . The diversity of individual Rab binding partner determines the specific vesicle transport route and creates the complexity of membrane trafficking . Autophagy is responsible for degradation of intracellu - lar components by transporting them to lysosomes to maintain cellular homeostasis and prevent pathogens in - fection . Rab proteins are also involved in the regulation of autophagy biogenesis [ 27 ] . Rab5 , for example , partici - pates in autophagy induction by the sequential signaling cascade in response to growth factor [ 28 ] . Overexpres - sion of Rab32 promotes autophagosome biogenesis [ 29 ] . Rab33 has also been reported to regulate autophago - some formation through interaction with ATG16L , an essential factor for LC3 lipidation and membrane bio - genesis in autophagy [ 30 ] . Several Rabs including Rab7 , Rab11 , Rab24 and Rab25 play critical roles in modulat - ing autophagosome maturation [ 31 – 34 ] . In ovarian can - cer cells , knockdown of Rab25 increases the conversion of LC3 - I to LC3 - II , a critical step for autophagy , and in - duces apoptosis . These results indicate a role of Rab25 in tumorigenesis relevant to autophagy suppression [ 34 ] . Emerging evidence has shown that exosomes act as a novel mode of intercellular communication . They deliver message from cancer cells to surrounding stromal cells as well as distant metastatic sites to create a pre - metastatic niche [ 35 ] . Exosome secretion is regulated by fusion of the plasma membrane with multivesicular bodies ( MVBs ) , which are late endosomal structure of endocytic pathway containing intraluminal vesicles . It has been observed that Rab proteins critically contribute to exsosome release . For example , Rab11 regulates transferrin receptor secretion via the exosome pathway [ 36 ] . Similarly , Rab35 pro - motes exosome release by interacting with its effector TBC1D10A - C [ 37 ] . The role of Rabs in regulation of exosome pathway also has been explored in association with tumor progression . Indeed , Rab27 - dependent exo - some secretion of microRNAs is linked to tumor inva - siveness in bladder cancer [ 38 ] . Dysregulated Rab GTPases implicated in cancer Emerging evidence show that aberrant expression of Rab GTPases is closely associated with tumorigenesis ( Fig . 1 ) . Indeed , a set of Rab proteins including Rab1 , Rab2A , Rab3D , Rab8 , Rab11 , Rab21 , Rab23 , Rab25 , Rab27B , Rab35 and others ( as reviewed in Table 1 ) promotes tumor cell migration and invasion to exhibit their effects on tumorigenesis and metastasis by regulating intracel - lular signal transduction [ 39 – 49 ] . Elevated expression of oncogenic Rab1 has been reported in several cancer types and is associated with poor survival [ 50 – 53 ] . Over - expression of Rab1A promotes mTORC1 signaling and oncogenic growth in response to amino acids stimulation and therefore enhances tumor progression and invasion in colorectal cancer [ 50 , 51 ] . In addition , gene amplification and overexpression of Rab23 enhance cancer cell invasion and correlate with advanced - stage gastric cancer [ 47 ] . Moreover , it has been recently shown that Rabs - mediated vesicle dynamics cooperates with oncogenic signaling pathway to promote tumorigenesis . Indeed , Rab2A drives breast cancer stem cells expansion through activation of Erk signaling [ 44 ] . High expression of Rab25 has been frequently associated with poor progno - sis in breast and ovarian cancer . Mechanistically , Rab25 expression promotes anti - apoptotic phosphoinositide 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) - Akt pathway and inhibits pro - apoptotic molecules expression such as BAK thereby increasing aggressiveness of cancer cells [ 48 ] . Recently , another oncogenic Rab35 has been identified by two gain - of - function mutations in tumor cells . It is proposed that constitutively active Rab35 mediates internalization of platelet - derived growth factor receptor α to LAMP2 - positive endosomal membrane , where it drives the acti - vation of oncogenic PI3K / Akt signaling [ 49 ] , suggesting that Rabs - mediated vesicle dynamics and oncogenic sig - naling cooperate to direct tumor progression . Malfunction of Rabs - regulating vesicle trafficking could promote cancer invasion . For example , Rab11 is an im - portant component for membrane proteins recycling and proteins transport from TGN to the plasma membrane [ 54 ] . Rab11 - mediated α 6 β 4 integrin trafficking has been found to contribute to increase cancer cell invasion in breast cancer [ 39 ] . Similarly , Rab25 facilitates invasive cell Tzeng and Wang Journal of Biomedical Science ( 2016 ) 23 : 70 Page 2 of 7 migration by controlling α 5 β 1 integrin trafficking through the recycling endosomes [ 40 ] . Oncogenic Rab8 transports exocytic vesicles carrying membrane type 1 - matrix metal - loproteinase ( MT1 - MMP ) to the plasma membrane for matrix degradation of migrating cancer cells cultured in collagen gel [ 41 ] . In a similar scenario , through mass spec - trometric analysis , heat - shock protein 90a has been identi - fied as a component of Rab27B - regulated vesicles , acting as a pro - invasive growth regulator required for activation of matrix metalloproteinase 2 ( MMP2 ) . An increased ex - pression of Rab27B is associated with the poor prognosis of oestrogen receptor - positive breast cancer patients , sup - porting the role of Rab27B in tumor promotion [ 42 ] . In contrast to the roles of Rabs in promoting tumor progression , a minor fraction of Rabs is proposed to serve as tumor suppressor ( Table 1 ) . However , Rab pro - teins may have diverse functions in different types or subtypes of cancers . For example , in addition to its role in increasing invasiveness of cancer cells , Rab25 has also been identified to act as a tumor suppressor by inhibit - ing invasive and angiogenic activities in esophageal squa - mous cell carcinoma [ 55 ] and by increasing malignant tumor formation in the intestines of Rab25 - / - ; Apc Min / - mice [ 56 ] . The oncogenic or tumor suppressive func - tions of Rab25 are cell - type dependent . Rab25 enhances the aggressiveness in ovarian and breast cancer cells [ 48 ] , while it functions as a tumor suppressor in esopha - geal squamous cell carcinoma and colorectal carcinoma [ 55 , 56 ] . An explanation for the discrepancies is that the role of Rab25 in tumorigenesis is dependent on specific or a group of cancer type and on its interplay with cell - type specific effectors . Rab37 is another example of diverse functions in different types of cancers . Upregulation of Rab37 and its interacting partner TMEM22 are found in renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) and decrease in its level by siRNA re - duces cancer cell growth , suggesting the oncogenic - like role of Rab37 in RCC [ 57 ] . However , promoter hyperme - thylation of Rab37 gene leading to low expression of Rab37 mRNA and protein is associated with advanced metastasis in non - small cell lung cancer patients [ 58 ] . These results may attributed to Rab - mediated cell - type specific distinct downstream pathways or cargo trafficking . Interestingly , Rab37 - mediated exocytosis of tissue inhibi - tor of metalloproteinase 1 ( TIMP1 ) inactivates extracellu - lar MMP9 and thereby suppresses cell invasion signaling [ 59 ] . Of note , reconstituted TIMP1 by addition of TIMP1 recombinant protein abolishes the migration and invasion ability of lung cancer cells in vitro and in vivo [ 59 ] . In addition , 5 - Aza - 2 - deoxycytidine treatment of a highly Fig . 1 Schematic diagram showing the Rab proteins - mediated vesicular transport and signaling pathways in tumorigenesis . Rab family proteins play key roles in regulating cellular membrane trafficking including endocytosis , exocytosis , exosome secretion as well as vesicles delivery between organelles . All of these vesicles dynamics affects cellular physiology . Dysregulation of oncogenic Rabs at the protein levels or activity such as Rab1 , Rab25 and Rab35 exerts tumor - promoting properties such as anti - apoptosis , increase in proliferation , invasion and migration through activation of various signaling pathways . For example , Rab2A facilitates Erk1 / 2 activation and thus leads to Zeb1 upregulation and β - catenin nuclear translocation , then promotes tumor initiation . In contrast , malfunction of tumor suppressor Rabs promotes oncogenesis and tumor progression . For example , Rab37 delivers its cargo TIMP1 to inhibit MMP9 activity leading to suppression of tumor motility , while loss of Rab37 - mediated TIMP1 secretion promotes tumor metastasis . Arrows indicate vesicular movement regulated by Rab proteins . Thick arrows represent Rabs - mediated signaling pathways involved in tumorigenesis and tumor suppression . Note that some organelles and vesicles are relatively enlarged to emphasize the pathways involved Tzeng and Wang Journal of Biomedical Science ( 2016 ) 23 : 70 Page 3 of 7 metastatic lung cancer cell line shows demethylation and re - expression of the Rab37 gene and correlates with reduced cancer cell migration [ 58 ] . The last - mentioned two studies provide therapeutic strategies such as DNA demethylation of Rab37 gene and increased expression of Rab37 protein and its cargos such as TIMP1 could facili - tate the development of anti - cancer treatment . Rab GTPases regulators mediate cancer progression Dysregulated interaction between Rabs and their effec - tors could also link to tumor progression and malig - nancy . Effector proteins including GEFs , GAPs and GDIs together with tethering factors and SNAREs play key roles in regulating Rab GTPase function as molecu - lar switches by cycling between active membrane - bound GTP and inactive cytosolic GDP - bound forms . For ex - ample , numerous effectors for Rab5 have been identified , including Rabaptin - 5 , Vac1 , early endosome antigen 1 ( EEA1 ) , PI3K , and Class C core vacuole / endosome teth - ering ( CORVET ) . Increased expression of Rabaptin - 5 , a Rab effector interacting with GTP - bound Rab5 , acceler - ates endocytosis of epidermal growth factor receptor via Rab5 - mediated endosomal fusion pathway and subse - quently affects tumor progression [ 60 , 61 ] . The effector of Rab11 , Rab11 - family interacting protein 2 ( Rab11 - FIP2 ) , has been implicated in regulation of recycling endosomal trafficking through interaction with Rab11a [ 62 ] . Rab11 - FIP2 increases epithelial - mesenchymal tran - sition and metastasis in gastric cancer [ 63 ] . Rab11 - FIP2 also promotes colorectal cancer cells migration and invasion by upregulating MMP7 expression through activating PI3K / Akt signaling [ 64 ] . In contrast , Rab11 - FIP1C , another effector of Rab11 , acts as a tumor sup - pressor in ErbB2 - mediated breast cancer [ 65 ] . DENND2B , a GEF for Rab13 , activates Rab13 - mediated exocytosis and enhances the invasiveness of cancer cells . Disruption of Rab13 - mediated trafficking limits the spread of epithelial cancer cells [ 66 , 67 ] . Moreover , alteration of SNARE complex has been shown to involve in tumorigenesis . SNARE complex are composed of vesicle associated SNAREs ( v - SNARE ) and SNAREs at targeting membrane ( t - SNAREs ) . The trans - SNAREs for - mation by interaction of v - SNAREs with t - SNAREs allows the fusion of vesicle and acceptor membrane . Notably , an increase in interaction between Syntaxin6 and Rab11 / vesicle - associated membrane protein 3 ( VAMP3 ) on recyc - ling endosome inhibits α v β 1 and α v β 3 integrins recycling and suppresses cell migration [ 68 ] . Conversely , Rab7 and Table 1 Oncogenic and tumor suppressor Rab proteins in cancers Rab protein Cancer types Expression Clinical implications References Rab1 Colon Increased Elevated cell invasion , poor prognosis [ 50 ] Liver Increased Elevated cell invasion , poor prognosis [ 51 ] Brain Increased Poor survival [ 52 ] Rab2 Breast Increased Expansion of stem - like cells , poor prognosis [ 44 ] Rab3 Breast Increased Elevated cell motility [ 45 ] Brain Increased Tumor progression [ 81 ] Rab4 Breast Increased Elevated cell motility [ 82 ] Rab5 Lung Increased activity Elevated cell motility [ 83 ] Rab11 Breast Increased activity Elevated cell invasion [ 39 ] Rab17 Liver Decreased Elevated clinical tumor characteristics [ 84 ] Rab21 Cervical cancer Increased Elevated cell motility [ 46 ] Rab23 Stomach Increased Poor prognosis [ 47 ] Rab25 Ovarian , Breast Increased Poor prognosis [ 48 ] Esophagus Decreased Poor survival [ 55 ] Colon Decreased Poor survival [ 56 ] Rab27 Breast Increased Poor prognosis [ 42 ] Rab31 Breast Increased Poor survival [ 85 ] Rab35 Not applicable Gain of function mutations Anti - apoptosis [ 49 ] Rab37 Lung Decreased Poor prognosis [ 58 , 59 ] Rab38 Brain Increased Poor prognosis [ 86 ] Tzeng and Wang Journal of Biomedical Science ( 2016 ) 23 : 70 Page 4 of 7 VAMP7 cooperatively mediate endosomal recycling of membrane type MT1 - MMP to promote cancer cells migra - tion and invasion [ 69 ] . These findings reveal that the effec - tors and SNAREs of Rabs - mediated membrane trafficking are involved in tumorigenesis . Nevertheless , more research is needed to better understand the complexity of the inter - action between Rabs - effectors - SNAREs . Rabs and Rab effectors in tumorigenic signalings Phosphorylation of Rab proteins is important for vesicle targeting and traffic . Rab5a has been reported to be phosphorylated by PKC ε to facilitate T - cell migration [ 70 ] . Mechanistically , phosphorylated Rab5a promotes Rac1 activation to facilitate actin remodeling . Conven - tional PKC - mediated Rab11 and Rab6 phosphorylation results in impaired endosomal recycling and redistribu - tion in cytosolic fraction , respectively [ 71 , 72 ] . Studies have shown that phosphorylation of Rab4 by p34 cdc2 prevents the association of Rab4 with endosomal mem - brane by dissociating its binding to membrane effector during the cell cycle [ 73 , 74 ] . Interestingly , dephosphory - lation of Rab7 by PTEN is important for its membrane targeting and subsequent activation , suggesting that phosphorylation status is critical for regulating Rab7 endosomal localization and activity [ 75 ] . Rab8A phosphor - ylation on Ser111 is also observed to impair its binding to Rabin8 , the GEF for Rab8A that triggers GDP exchange [ 76 ] . However , the significance of post - translational modi - fications in the regulation of Rab GTPase activity is poorly defined . The clinical relevance of the modifications such as phosphorylation of Rabs in human cancers still remains largely uncharacterized . In addition , phosphorylation - dependent regulation of Rabs effectors plays important roles in coordinating Rabs - mediated vesicle trafficking . For example , connec - denn1 / 2 are identified as GEFs for Rab35 . Akt - mediated connecdenn 1 / 2 phosphorylation promotes the inter - action of Rab35 and its GEF [ 77 ] . Unc - 51 - like kinases have been reported to phosphorylate DENND3 and up - regulate its GEF activity toward Rab12 . Activation of Rab12 facilitates autophagosome trafficking in response to starvation [ 78 ] . Accordingly , phosphorylation of Ra - bin8 , a GEF for Rab8 , by ERK1 / 2 increases its GEF activ - ity and promotes recycling of transferrin to the plasma membrane [ 79 ] . Importantly , dysregulated phosphoryl - ation of Rabs effectors involves in tumorigenesis . For example , Rabaptin - 5 , a Rab5 effector in endosomal membrane fusion , is a protein kinase D ( PKD ) substrate . Interestingly , phosphorylated Rabaptin - 5 interacts pref - erentially with Rab4 , but not Rab5 , to promote α v β 3 recycling leading to enhanced cell motility and invasion [ 80 ] . The oncogenic signaling pathways of Rab effec - tors in promoting tumor development or suppressing tumorigenesis need further elucidation . Conclusion Taken together , as key regulators of cargo transport in vesicle trafficking , it is not surprising that Rab proteins have been linked to tumorigenesis or tumor prevention . Vesicle delivery and dynamics are critical for regulation of cell behaviors associated with cell migration / invasion and tumorigenesis . Notably , specific Rab proteins may have diverse functions in different types or subtypes of cancers . Although mutations or alterations in expression of the components of vesicle transporting machinery may not directly drive cell transformation , cooperation between Rabs and effectors in mediating vesicle move - ment pathways has critical influences on tumor progres - sion and malignancy . Therefore , it raises the possibility that targeting particular trafficking system may provide a new approach to cancer treatment .
