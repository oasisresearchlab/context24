However , this topic has not been investigated in detail . This study , first , deploys science mapping techniques to provide a comprehensive analysis of the output , impact , and structure of the Colombian scientific elite , i . e . , researchers awarded with the Alejandro A´ngel Escobar Foundation National Prize 1990 – 2020 , known locally as the Colombian Nobel . Second , we conducted a productivity and impact comparison between the Colombian scientific elite and Nobel Prize laureates in science and economics by means of a stratified random sample 1990 – 2020 via the composite citation indicator pro - posed by Ioannidis et al . Findings showed that the Colombian scientific elite has a broader agenda than indexing titles in internationally renowned bibliographic databases . The Colom - bian scientific elite also showed positive growth , which is an inverse trend compared with the sample of Nobel laureate productivity . There were no noticeable changes in productivity / impact before and after receiving the Alejandro A´ngel Escobar Foundation National Prize . Institutional collaboration within the Colombian scientific elite displayed the highest betweenness ( brokerage ) role of world / local top - tier universities . However , only two Colom - bian scientific elite members published an article with two Nobel Prize laureates . Most of the research profiles reflected the national output priorities , but were found to diverge from the national focus in respect of strategic research capacities . The interleaving of the Colombian scientific elite and Nobel Prize laureates—particularly between the 3 rd and 2 nd quartiles— enabled a more nuanced analysis of the local impact in the global scientific landscape . Our findings also contrast with previous findings on the lower research impact of authors from Latin America , despite their involvement as contributors to reputable journals , and also shed light on the research performance - impact standards and agenda between the global North and South and provide an in - context assessment of outstanding local research .

Roberts—Nobel Prize winner in physiology / medicine—out - lined ten simple rules to win a Nobel Prize and be part of the global scientific elite ( GSE ) [ 1 ] . Among these rules were the following : work in the laboratory of a previous Nobel Prize winner ; try to work in the laboratory of a future Nobel Prize winner ; or pick your family ( i . e . , Nobel lau - reates ) carefully . For developing countries such as Colombia , none of those rules are simple considering the null population of Nobel laureates in science currently teaching / researching at a national university . GSEs push the frontiers of knowledge . Yet , despite a well - established agenda [ 2 – 27 ] , researchers or scientific awardees from developing countries have been sidelined . Let us con - sider two well - known examples : Nobel Prize laureates and highly - cited and productive institu - tions / researchers [ 9 , 10 , 28 , 29 ] . First , seventy - seven percent of the Nobel Prize laureates in physics had US , German , UK , French , or Russian citizenship [ 30 ] . In contrast , 2 % had citizen - ships from developing countries such as China , Pakistan , India , or Morocco [ 30 ] . Second , most of the world’s scientific wealth ( i . e . , research output and citations ) has been accumulated in a few premier institutions in developed countries [ 31 – 33 ] . Such staggering inequality is reflected in the fact that the top 1 % of most - cited authors constitutes over a fifth of all citations globally [ 34 ] . To understand why this is the case , it is necessary to look at the nature of scien - tific elites through the lens of developing countries’ historical , economic , institutional , and cul - tural contexts , research standards , and affiliations . [ 35 – 40 ] . This study focuses on Colombia , which ranks among the top five countries in Latin Amer - ica in total document output and the top - fifty in total citations worldwide 1996 – 2019 [ 41 ] . Colombia’s national investment in science , technology and innovation activities is a mere 0 . 8 % of the GDP ( gross domestic product ) ( 2015 – 2020 ) [ 42 ] . Similarly , the country’s invest - ment in R & D ( research and development ) has yet to surpass 0 . 4 % of the GDP ( 2015 – 2020 ) , which is below the Latin American average of 0 . 7 % ( 2013 ) [ 42 , 43 ] . The Latin American region is also below the world average of 2 . 2 % in R & D investment ( 2018 ) [ 44 ] . Regarding the scien - tific workforce , Colombia has 58 researchers per million inhabitants ( male : 65 % ; female : 35 % ) , compared with 260 in Mexico ( male : 67 % ; female : 33 % ) or 1 , 206 in Argentina ( male : 47 % ; female : 53 % ) [ 43 ] . At the other end of the spectrum , i . e . , in the high - income countries , Den - mark has 7 , 310 researchers per million inhabitants ( male : 65 % ; female : 35 % ) and Finland 7 , 009 ( male : 68 % ; female : 32 % ) [ 43 ] . This disparity is all the more striking when viewed in the context of Noble Prize laureates from Colombia , the subject of this study . The Nobel Prize has been awarded to Gabriel Garcı´a Ma´rquez ( literature ) and Juan Manuel Santos ( peace ) , but none in the science categories . Likewise , only one Colombian researcher is listed in the 2020 edition of Clarivate’s Highly Cited Researchers : Olga Sarmiento , Universidad de Los Andes [ 30 , 45 ] . Based on these standards , a Colombian scientific elite ( CSE ) is non - exis - tent . Colombia does , however , have its own Nobel Prize equivalent : the Alejandro Ángel Esco - bar Foundation National Prize ( AAEP ) [ 46 , 47 ] . The organization’s founder—inspired by the Swedish inventor and his legacy—stated that the AAEPs “ are to be awarded for truly meritori - ous work that deserves the mark of excellence at least within the cultural context of the country . ” [ 48 ] . Each year the AAEF invites all researchers of Colombian nationality—regardless of local or international affiliation—to submit their research for assessment by the Foundation’s com - mittee ( i . e . , peer - reviewed articles or books , master’s or Ph . D . thesis , technical reports , inde - pendent research ) . If the document is multiauthored , the authors have to assign a representative / coordinator , who will receive the prize money and a silver medal . The represen - tative / coordinator must be a native Colombian . This national recognition has been awarded annually since 1955 . There are three science categories [ 48 ] : 1 ) physics and natural sciences ; 2 ) PLOS ONE The Colombianscientificelite PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0269116 May 26 , 2022 2 / 34 awarded - AAEP ; authorsex ; year ; awardcategory ; documenttitle ; abstract ( Spanish ) ; affiliation at the time the awardwas received ; institution’s country and city ; highest / last degree ; and the university that granted the academic degreeand country .

Competinginterests : The authorshave declared that no competinginterestsexist . social sciences and humanities ; and 3 ) environmental sciences and sustainable development . There is an honorable mention for each category if the jury decides so [ 48 ] and these acknowl - edged researchers are considered members of the CSE ( e . g . , Salomo´n Hakim [ neurosurgeon ] in 1967 and 1974 ; and Ana Marı´a Rey [ physicist ] in 2007 ) . The purpose of studying the CSE — and scientific elites in developing countries in general — is to understand its performance and research and collaboration structures in comparison with the GSE . The findings shed light on the research performance - impact standards and agenda between the global North and South . They also provide an in - context assessment of outstanding local research [ 49 – 52 ] amid the decreasing share of new Nobel Prize laureates from North America and an inverse trend from the Asia - Pacific region [ 4 ] . To the best of our knowledge , no research has been conducted on the CSE or any other developing country’s sci - entific elite using bibliometric techniques [ 53 ] . Accordingly , this study aims to provide a com - prehensive analysis of the output , impact , and structure of the CSE and draw a comparison with the GSE . This inquiry is guided by the following research questions ( RQs ) : • RQ1 : Is the CSE more productive / cited before or after receiving the AAEP ? [ 6 , 11 , 22 , 54 , 55 ] • RQ2 : Does the CSE collaboration network have any participation in the GSE or world top - tier institutions ? [ 26 , 33 , 56 ] • RQ3 : What are the research fronts of the CSE ? [ 7 ] , and • RQ4 : Is the CSE light years away from the productivity and impact of the GSE ? [ 31 , 36 , 57 – 59 ] Following this introduction , section 2 reviews recent literature on GSEs . Section 3 outlines the data , methods , and techniques implemented . The methods and techniques implemented are coau - thorship networks , both at the institutional and author levels ; bibliographic coupling ; and a com - parative sample of 82 researchers ( i . e . , 41 AAEPs and 41 Nobel Prize laureates ) using the composite citation indicator proposed by Ioannidis et al . [ 55 ] . Coauthorship networks map scientific collabo - ration , enabling researchers to identify the extent to which social connections contribute to the co - creation of knowledge . Bibliographic coupling discloses the clustering of research fronts , while the proposed composite citation indicator addresses total impact , normalized coauthorship , and author order based on six indicators at the author level . Section 4 presents the results to be discussed in sec - tion 5 . Finally , section 6 presents the conclusions , limitations , and future agenda . Literature review Research on the GSE is well - established in the informetrics literature [ 2 – 15 , 21 – 24 , 26 , 27 , 60 – 63 ] . For example , a Boolean search on Scopus’s bibliographic database with the keyword “Nobel Prize” limited to 14 core journals on informetrics and research evaluation ( e . g . , Journal of Informetrics , Scientometrics , JASIS & T ) [ 57 ] , returned 75 results . We limited the review to three areas of interest : 1 ) international awards / prizes networks ; 2 ) latest research on produc - tion and impact of the GSE ; 3 ) and on the intellectual and social structure of the GSE . First , Zheng and Liu [ 18 ] developed a “co - awardees” network of significant international awards / prizes according to awardees’ assessment , establishing a similarity between the Nobel Prize and other awards / prizes awardees ( e . g . , Wolf , Lorentz , and Shaw awards / prizes ) . Subse - quent work by Ma and Uzzi [ 13 ] assembled a scientific prize network based on 3 , 000 + prizes and the careers of 10 , 000 + prizewinners over a 100 - year period . They found that the number of prizes doubled every 25 years , that the science hierarchy is becoming more vertical , and that having an awarded advisor is essential for winning at least one prize . The winning of subse - quent prizes , however , is more a matter of expanding one’s own network . PLOS ONE The Colombianscientificelite PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0269116 May 26 , 2022 3 / 34 Second , recent work on the GSE concluded that the business of predicting the next Nobel had become a fruitless exercise since the laureates rank among the 500 most - cited authors after the 1970s compared to those awarded in the early twentieth century and their contribu - tions have been limited to research niches rather than the discipline as a whole [ 22 ] . This was further refined by Ioannidis et al . [ 7 ] , who found that of the 114 domains investigated , only five ( i . e . , particle physics [ 14 % ] , cell biology [ 12 . 1 % ] , atomic physics [ 10 . 9 % ] , neuroscience [ 10 . 1 % ] , and molecular chemistry [ 5 . 3 % ] ) accounted for 52 . 4 % of the Nobel Prizes awarded . Taking a closer look at the features of the Nobelists’ papers , Zhou et al . [ 54 ] estimated that 74 . 7 % were cited more than 500 times , innovative research was more cited than theoretical and experimental methods , and most of the papers were published in journals with an Impact Factor between 5 – 10 . Ioannidis et al . [ 15 , 55 ] examined the most - cited biomedical researchers and proposed a composite citation indicator assessment of 84 , 000 + highly - cited scientists in 12 fields . Among their findings , a number of scientists stated that research related to progres - sive evolution ( i . e . , continuous progress ; broader interest ; greater synthesis ) rather than revo - lution was the most characteristic feature of a blockbuster paper . Based on the proposed composite citation indicator , many Nobelists ranked among the top - 1000 highly - cited authors , but would rank much lower if based solely on citations . Similarly , highly - cited authors had published either none or very few influential papers as a first , single , or last author . One of the most comprehensive studies on Nobelists’ careers [ 11 ] found that they were pro - ductive from the outset ( twice as many papers as a random scientist ) , showed a six - fold increase in publishing hit papers ( top 1 % of rescaled 10 - year citations ) and published on aver - age two hit papers . Nevertheless , the overall career path before winning the prize is similar to that of other scientists . While the laureates’ collaboration network did not increase after the Nobel Prize , it tended to be more consistent in productivity and impact . Contrasting Nobes - lists with highly - cited researchers , Kosmulski [ 6 ] — the only study that included the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel — argued that the virtue of publishing hot papers ( 0 . 1 % of the top papers in the field in the past two years ) is not common among recent Nobel laureates while the number of scientists who have at least one highly - cited paper substantially exceeds 100 , 000 . Kosmulski [ 6 ] also found that Nobel Prize papers connect topically diverse clusters of research papers [ 8 ] . Schlagberger et al . [ 33 ] highlighted US domi - nance at the national and institutional level given that four US institutions hold most of the Nobelists in physics , chemistry , and physiology ( i . e . , UC Berkeley , Columbia , MIT , and Princeton ) . While Nobelists are mobile , they generally hail from the US , UK , Japan , and Germany . Third , studies on the Nobelist collaboration network [ 26 , 64 ] found that laureates published fewer papers , but with a higher than average citation , a feature further supported by Li et al . [ 11 ] . Nobelists tend to play a brokerage role in the collaboration networks by building intellec - tual and social bridges and exploiting structural holes . Jiang and Liu [ 64 ] , for example , noted a high level of institutional inequality across periods . The most connected institution during 1990 – 1940 was the Humboldt University ; during 1941 – 1980 it was the University of Cam - bridge , and during 1981 – 2017 it was Harvard University , a phenomenon outlined earlier [ 33 ] . Despite the considerable research already undertaken , the above literature review exposes two major limitations . First , as noted by Zheng and Liu [ 18 ] and Ioannidis et al . [ 7 ] , further studies are needed that will incorporate other disciplines such as the social sciences and humanities . Second , since the study by Schlagberger et al . [ 33 ] focused solely on US institu - tions , a broader landscape is needed to research institutions in developing countries . To close these two gaps , this study includes researchers in social sciences and humanities , environmen - tal science and sustainable development , who for the most part are affiliated with Colombian institutions . While the latter are not comparable to US institutions in terms of global PLOS ONE The Colombianscientificelite PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0269116 May 26 , 2022 4 / 34 reputation , some of these Colombian institutions have garnered a regional reputation , particu - larly in Latin America and the Caribbean ( e . g . , Universidad Nacional or Universidad de Los Andes ) [ 65 ] . Materials and methods Data Colombian scientific elite . The CSE list was sourced from the AAEF website ( 2000 – 2020 ) and from a book published by the AAEF ( 1990 – 1999 ) commemorating its half - century [ 53 ] . We decided to restrict our sample to the last 30 years’ awardees in light of Colombian research - ers’ late involvement in publishing research articles in international journals ( since the early 1990 , ~ 200 papers were published annually in the Science Citation Index ) [ 66 ] . We further restricted our sample to the leading author or representative in the case of multi - authored doc - uments . Table 1 presents the CSE sample of 87 awardees categorized by sex and award . Female researchers have a 25 . 3 % participation among the awardees , with the highest participation in social sciences and humanities ( SoSci ) with 11 . 4 % . In contrast , male researchers have 74 . 7 % of the total participation , the highest being in physics and natural sciences ( PhySci ) with 32 . 2 % . While the issue of sex differential among scientists lies beyond the scope of this study , it is worth noting that the differential among AAEPs is similar to that among Nobel Prize winners . Evidence shows [ 67 ] that ten women were awarded a Nobel Prize in the sciences between 2004 – 2019 , which is the same number of awardees during the first 100 years of Nobel history . Multiple causes have been cited to account for this discrepancy , such as marital and maternity status , lack of role models , and a lack of interest in following an academic career . All of which impact both productivity and further research for women . S1 Table presents the higher / last academic degree by university and country according to the Colombian Ministry of Science , Technology , and Innovation platform for researchers’ cur - riculum : CvLAC [ 68 ] . Thirty - one percent of researchers have completed an academic degree in the US and 28 % a Ph . D . in reputable universities such as Harvard , MIT , Yale , or Wisconsin - Madison . In contrast , 27 . 6 % have completed an academic degree in Colombia and 12 . 6 % a Ph . D . in reputable Colombian universities such as Nacional , Antioquia , Valle , or Los Andes [ 68 ] ( See also : Data availability ) . Bibliographic data . Scopus was chosen over Web of Science ( WoS ) due to its broader journal coverage and researcher participation from developing countries , particularly Colom - bia [ 40 , 69 – 71 ] . Based on the CSE list above , we searched and sourced the complete profiles in Table 1 . Colombian scientific elite by sex and AAEF award category .

Those with only one indexed article were excluded . We also checked each author’s current or past affiliation in the CvLAC [ 68 ] to avoid the inclusion of homony - mous authors . The working sample of CSE with Scopus profiles consisted of 41 researchers , ~ 47 % of the preliminary CSE list displayed in Table 1 . For multiple - year AAEP awardees , the first year was considered for related assessments . Germa´n Poveda is a particular case in point , having been awarded three times ( i . e . , PhySci : 1999 ; EnvSci : 2007 , 2019 ) . We assigned him to the EnvSci category since he was awarded twice in that category . The CSE sample contains a similar sample of researchers compared to previous studies on non - Nobel laureates ( e . g . , 29 recipients of the Derek John de Solla Prize Medal [ 72 ] ) . Table 2 presents the bibliometric descriptives . Environmental sciences and sustainable development ( EnvSci ) and physical sciences ( PhySci ) were the categories with the most pro - files found in Scopus . PhySci was the category with the highest number of articles , authors , and citations per document . EnvSci , however , showed the highest annual growth rate . The most relevant periodical ( most frequent ) for SoSci was Revista de Estudios Sociales ( Colombia – U . Andes ) , for EnvSci Biotropica ( Wiley ) , and for PhySci Physical Review A – Atomic Molecular and Optical Physics ( American Physical Society ) . This is consistent with the publishing and citation dynamics of the above disciplinary categories : SoSci is oriented towards the publica - tion of books / book chapters in local journals , while PhySci - related disciplines tend to publish international research articles or conference proceedings [ 73 – 76 ] . Articles ( 921 ) with 10 + authors [ 77 ] were excluded from the analysis . These were mostly from medicine : 26 % ; earth and planetary sciences : 22 . 6 % ; and biochemistry , genetics and molecular biology : 18 . 6 % . Such publications are difficult to assess since they could be either a product of publishing agree - ments or highly collaborative authors with marginal research input [ 59 ] . Due to Scopus’ index - ing accuracy , we only analyzed articles published between 1996 – 2020 [ 69 ] . Methods AAEP research topics . A semantic network was built based on each title of the awarded research document by category . The aim was to explore the document titles and examine the shared meaning and interconnection between key terms among titles [ 80 ] . A co - occurrence matrix was assembled to compute the number and direction of unique - word co - occurrence Table 2 .

Finally , a directed - weighted semantic network was produced based on the co - occurrence matrix . Two network analysis characteris - tics / metrics were computed : community detection ; and betweenness . For the former , we implemented the Blondel et al . [ 81 ] modularity appraisal algorithm , which gives a node’s capacity for mediating the flow of information between multiple clusters [ 82 ] . The equation for the betweenness calculation is : C B ð p k Þ ¼ P ni < j g ij ð p k Þ g ij ; i 6¼ j 6¼ k ð 1 Þ Source : [ 83 ] . where g ij is the shorter path that links nodes p i and g ij ( p k ) is the shorter path that links nodes p i and p j p k . The higher the value , the higher its betweenness . Output and citations . We outlined a descriptive section on articles and citations by cate - gory . We also explored the annual citation per article of the top three most - cited researchers per category before and after receiving the AAEP . Institutional collaboration and coauthorship . Bibliographic data of the CSE profiles was processed with bibliometrix for R [ 79 , 84 ] . Once this data has been processed and converted into the corresponding objects , preprocessing and cleaning are carried out in order to unify the authors’ names and affiliations . We used a multi - level approach for all the science mapping techniques implemented ( i . e . , coauthorship and bibliographic coupling analyses ) . A multi - level approach means analyzing the different structural features of a network at the macro ( i . e . , density and average path length ) ; meso ( i . e . , community detection ) ; and micro ( i . e . , betweenness centrality ) levels through the use of network indicators [ 85 ] . Regarding the multi - level network indicators used , density indicates the degree to which both authors and institutions are connected ( i . e . , the number of connections that exist compared to the number of connections that could exist ) . The equation for the density calculation is : den ¼ 2 L = n ð n (cid:0) 1 Þ ð 2 Þ Source : [ 86 ] . where L is the number of links and n is the number of nodes . The average path length com - putes the average number of steps along the shortest path for every pair of nodes ( i . e . , authors , institutions ) in a given network . The equation for the average path length calculation is : l G ¼ 1 n ð n (cid:0) 1 Þ P i 6¼ j d ð v i ; v j Þ ð 3 Þ Source : [ 87 ] . where d ( v i , v j ) is the length of the shortest path that exists between two nodes . We used the Leiden algorithm to identify communities ( i . e . , clusters ) [ 88 ] . Betweenness equation and inter - pretation were given in Eq ( 1 ) . Bibliographic coupling . A bibliographic coupling connects two documents if a common item was cited and appeared within both lists of references [ 89 ] . This facilitates an analysis of the clustering of shared items between documents and an investigation of disciplinary fronts that highlights how academic knowledge is shared [ 90 – 92 ] . This technique moderately outper - forms other science mapping techniques used to identify research fronts ( i . e . , co - citation anal - ysis , direct citation ) [ 93 ] . It is also an extremely serviceable tool in the analysis of highly interdisciplinary fields and has been used to analyze SDGs ( Sustainable Development Goals ) [ 94 ] , and the complete set of Nature journal publications spanning 150 years , ranging from the PLOS ONE The Colombianscientificelite PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0269116 May 26 , 2022 7 / 34 arts and social sciences to earth and space and clinical medicine . It is , therefore , an appropriate method for analyzing such a highly interdisciplinary category as the PhySci category of the AAEP [ 95 ] . The equation for obtaining a bibliographic coupling network is : B coup ¼ AxA 0 ð 4 Þ Source : [ 79 ] . where A is a document and x is a cited reference matrix . The element b ij indicates how many bibliographic couplings exist between documents i and j . B coup is both a non - negative / symmetrical matrix . The number of shared references defines the strength of the bibliographic coupling between two documents . The CSE and the GSE . The following steps were performed to conduct a comparative analysis between the CSE and the GSE : • We sourced the complete Scopus bibliographic profile of each Nobel Prize laureate during the same period as the CSE : 1990 – 2020 , in the science categories ( i . e . , physics , chemistry , and physiology and medicine ) , and the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Mem - ory of Alfred Nobel . A total of 248 laureate profiles were sourced . • We re - classified CSE and GSE researchers according to their core discipline / subject catego - ries since awardees in respect of both prizes have a wide range of ( under ) graduate back - grounds . Moreover , prize categories themselves cover a wide range of disciplines / research areas . For example , Juan Camilo Ca´rdenas , who belongs to the CSE , graduated from indus - trial engineering but was awarded his prize in the AAEP - EnvSci category ( 2009 ) . Another example is Daniel Kahneman , a psychologist who received the Nobel Prize in economics ( 2002 ) . The re - classification was conducted as follows : � Each CSE and GSE publication belongs to a single journal . Journals and serial titles are classified using the All Science Journal Classification ( ASJC ) , which is based on the aims and scopes of the title and its content [ 96 ] . � We cross - checked the printed ISSN of each journal in which the CSE and GSE researchers have published and matched its ASJC subject area . This cross - check procedure was con - ducted for each CSE and GSE researcher . � If a given journal belonged to more than one ASJC subject area , it was randomly assigned . � We then computed each researcher’s publication frequency according to the ASJC subject areas . � Each researcher was then assigned to one ASJC subject according to the researcher’s own most frequent ASJC subject based on his / her publication record . For example , Ca´rdenas , the abovementioned engineer who was awarded a prize in the EnvSci category , was assigned to the economics , econometrics and finance ASJC subject area since most of his articles were published in journals under that classification . � Once researchers were re - classified into ASJC subjects , a first filter was applied to ensure that the same ASJC category profiles of the GSE coincided with those of the CSE . We then implemented non - proportional stratified sampling since there were not enough val - ues for each strata ( i . e . , no balanced classes in the GSE - ASJC profiles ) due to the particu - lar disciplinary foci of the GSE . Table 2 shows the bibliometric descriptives of the selected laureates . The top three disciplines in the CSE were : agricultural and biological sciences ; PLOS ONE The Colombianscientificelite PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0269116 May 26 , 2022 8 / 34 arts and humanities ; and medicine . In the GSE , each of the following disciplines / fields had five researchers : medicine ; earth and planetary sciences ; physics and astronomy ; immunology and microbiology ; chemistry ; and economics , econometrics and finance . Fig 1 displays the ASJC subject area classification and grouping for CSE and GSE . • Since our sample is composed of researchers from multiple disciplines , we had to keep in mind the disciplinary differences so as not to commit methodological flaws , such as compar - ing the output and citations traditions and research dynamics between two researchers from physics and anthropology . For example , almost ¾ of research references in the humanities refer to books , whereas 80 % of those in the natural sciences refer to journal articles [ 97 ] . Accordingly , we replicated multiple citation indicators and their composite proposed by Ioannidis et al . [ 55 ] to compare individual researchers across different fields . In their seminal study , Ioannidis et al . [ 55 ] computed the composite citation indicator ( henceforth : Ci ) for 84 , 000 + scientists from 12 fields ( physics , mathematics , computer science , chemistry , earth sciences , engineering , biology / biotechnology , infectious disease , medicine , brain research , health sciences , and social sciences ) . Ci has also been used to compare software engineering with the multiple sub - fields of ‘information & communication technologies ; ’ to assess the scholarship of media experts on COVID - 19 by gender and country ; and to estimate the pub - lishing output of COVID - 19 and infectious disease experts across 174 research sub - fields [ 98 – 100 ] . In that line , Ci considers total impact ; normalized coauthorship ; and author order : � In the first are the number of citations and h index [ 101 ] . The h index is defined as follows : for a set of articles N of an author and defining c i as the number of citations correspond - ing to an article i then ordering the set of articles in decreasing order according to the number of citations , formally : h index ¼ max f i 2 N : c i � i g ð 5 Þ Fig 1 .

For a set of articles N with c i the number of citations for the article i and a i the number of corre - sponding authors , the cumulative sum of the inverse of the number of authors is pro - posed as the effective rank r eff ¼ P i 1 a i . Then , sorting the set of articles in decreasing order according to the number of citations , the hm index can be defined as : hm index ¼ max f r eff 2 N : c i � r eff g ð 6 Þ Source : [ 58 , 102 ] . � In the third , the number of citations as a single author ; as a single or first author ; and as a single , first or last author . • Finally , Ci was calculated as the sum of the 0 – 1 normalization log - transformation of the pre - vious indices . Authorship order is crucial when assigning credit / contribution to a research publication . With the exception of mathematics or economics [ 103 ] , the most credit assigned to a multi - authored article goes to the first author ( i . e . early - career researcher ) , and last author ( usually a mentorship figure ) [ 104 ] . Middle authors generally play a more specific / technical role ( i . e . , statistical analysis ) . In sum , C brings a more nuanced perspective of an author’s impact by including total impact , normalized coauthorship , and the author order as a proxy of the leading role ( or absence of it ) . Table 2 shows Scopus author profiles and bib - liometric descriptive of the GSE aggregated and by category 1996 – 2020 . Results AAEP research topics Fig 2 displays the semantic networks of the titles of the 88 CSE by category . In SoSci , high betweenness key terms were those related to history ( century ) and development . The two most populated clusters , grouping ~ 27 % of key terms , were related to indigenous peoples / territories ; and historical and territorial perspectives on political and social movements . In EnvSci , high betweenness terms were those related to territories and ecology . The two most populated clus - ters , grouping ~ 39 % of key terms , were related to local natural reserves management strategies ; and tools for conservation and identification of biodiversity in the Amazon . In PhySci , high betweenness key terms were those related to control and Alzheimer’s . The two most populated clusters , grouping ~ 31 % of key terms , were related to genetics , and research on Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s . In all categories , the key term with the highest betweenness was Colombia , highlighting the importance of research for local problems / understanding regardless of category . Output and citations . Fig 3 displays the total articles and citations per year by category . In the three different areas awarded by the AAEP , production was led by the PhySci category , followed by EnvSci and SoSci . This is expected given the output and citation dynamics differ - ential between PhySci and SoSci on inclusion and participation in international journal index - ing systems . In the case of citations , there is a well - defined peak produced by the impact of researchers such as Nubia Mu ñ oz , whose primary research is on the human papillomavirus ( HPV ) . In 2003 , Mu ñ oz published over 50 articles with ~ 14 , 000 citations , turning her into one of the most productive and impactful researchers among the CSE . Fig 3 shows the PhySci cate - gory citations with and without ( dotted line ) the inclusion of Nubia Mu ñ oz . Table 3 presents the most - cited article by AAEP category .

Fig 4 shows the citation per article by category of the top three most - cited researchers . Dot - ted lines indicate the year in which each researcher received the AAEP . First , in the discipline of PhySci , the top three researchers were : Nubia Mu ñ oz ( AAEP - 2006 ) ; Ana Marı´a Rey ( AAEP - 2007 ) ; and Iva´n Darı´o Ve´lez ( AAEP - 2003 ) . As previously stated , Mu ñ oz was the most prolific author in this category , with a peak of citations per paper in 2003 and another peak in 2007 , just after receiving the AAEP . However , this metric shows a decrease with no crucial peaks thereafter . Rey shows three peaks after receiving the award . Ve´lez received the award compara - tively early given that his most crucial peak occurred nearly nine years later ( 2012 ) . Thus , Mu ñ oz appears to have been awarded at the peak of her career , whereas Rey and Ve´lez were both awarded before their most impactful years . Second , in EnvSci , the top three researchers were : Germa´n Poveda ( AAEP - 2007 ) ; Juan Camilo Ca´rdenas ( AAEP - 2009 ) ; and Consuelo Montes ( AAEP - 2002 ) . Poveda was awarded after his third career peak . Two additional peaks—although lower—occurred later in his career . Ca´rdenas followed a similar trend . He was awarded after three career peaks , 2000 being the most significant , followed by a smaller peak in 2012 . Montes was awarded in the middle of her first peak , followed by two similar peaks ( 2006 and 2009 ) . Thus , whereas Poveda and Ca´r - denas received their awards after having reached their most important peaks , Montes had sev - eral post - award peaks . The SoSci category does not allow for much discussion . Suffice to say that after receiving the AAEP , Londo ñ o , and Castillejo - Cue´llar appear to have increased their intermittent involvement in publishing Scopus - indexed articles . Fig 3 .

The CSE - PhySci institutional collaboration network has a density of 0 . 017 ( Fig 5 ) . The average path length shows that two random institutions need ~ 3 steps between middle institutions to reach each other via the shortest path . The network’s principal component comprises 26 . 98 % nodes , followed by the remaining clusters with 26 . 84 % , 23 . 37 % , and 12 . 80 % , respectively . Five important Colombian universities ranked among the top - ten institutions with highest betweenness : three public , two private . The institution with the highest betweenness was Universidad de Antioquia ( Colom - bia – Public ) . Researchers such as Iva´n Darı´o Ve´lez ( PhySci - 1994 , 2003 ) are currently affiliated with this institution . In contrast , the remaining institutions are international universities or institutions such as the International Agency for research on Cancer ( France ) or the Institut Catal D’oncologia ( Spain ) , where Nubia Mu ñ oz conducts her research on the human papillo - mavirus . World - renowned universities such as Harvard University ( USA – Private ) , and Free University of Berlin ( Germany – Public ) also ranked among the top - ten . The CSE - EnvSci institutional collaboration network ( Fig 6 ) has a density of 0 . 031 , higher than PhySci , but a lower average path length of 2 . 6 . The principal component is composed of 83 . 8 % of nodes , followed by clusters with 7 . 3 and 2 . 2 % . The institution with the highest betweenness is the National University of Colombia ( Public ) , one of the most prestigious uni - versities in the country . Some authors like Germa´n Poveda - EnvSci are affiliated with this uni - versity . Among the list are seven major Colombian universities , while the remaining institutions are either international universities or institutions . Among the latter can be found Fig 4 .

The CSE - SoSci institutional collaboration network ( Fig 7 ) has a density of 0 . 133 , higher than those in PhySci and EnvSci , but composed of just ten nodes . The average path length is 1 . 25 . The principal component is composed of 40 % of nodes , followed by a cluster with 20 % of the nodes and two with 10 % . The institution with the highest betweenness is Universidad de Los Andes ( Colombia – Private ) , among Colombia’s most prestigious private universities . Authors such as Carl Henrik Langebaek ( SoSci - 2009 ) is affiliated with it . The remaining uni - versities do not have betweenness properties . There is only one international university : the University of California ( USA ) . Despite the CSE - institutional collaboration being composed mainly of local institutions , they also have a high betweenness of reputable international insti - tutions—in some cases , among the world’s top - tier—particularly in the PhySci and EnvSci categories . The CSE - PhySci coauthorship network ( Fig 8 ) has a density of 0 . 007 . The average path length of 3 . 62 means that ~ 4 steps on average are needed for two random nodes to reach each other via the shortest path . The network’s principal component comprises 31 . 95 % of the nodes , followed by the remaining clusters with 16 . 81 % , 14 . 57 % , 8 . 49 % , and 7 . 45 % , respectively . Mu ñ oz has the highest betweenness within the principal component . In the second place is Luis Fernando Garcı´a ( AAEP - 2000 ) , a physician affiliated with Universidad de Antioquia . Mauricio Restrepo , within Mu ñ oz’s cluster , serves as a bridge between the Mu ñ oz and Garcı´a clusters . Restrepo , on his part , is affiliated with the National Institute of Health , Colombia , and connects the Mu ñ oz and Felipe Guhl clusters . Guhl ( AAEP - 1998 ) is a biologist at Universidad de Los Andes . Finally , the Ana Marı´a Rey cluster ( AAEP - 2007 ) is a closed network . Rey Fig 6 . Institutional collaboration network – EnvSci .

The network’s principal component comprises 42 . 82 % of the nodes , followed by the remaining clusters comprising 18 . 48 % , 17 . 89 % , 6 . 74 % , and 4 . 99 % , respectively . The node with the highest betweenness is Germa´n Poveda ( AAEP - 1999 , 2007 , 2019 ) , affiliated with Universi - dad Nacional de Colombia , Medellı´n . He specializes in hydraulics . O´scar Jose´ Mesa ( AAEP - 2000 , 2007 ) , with the same affiliation as Poveda , ranked in 2 nd place . He also works in hydrau - lics . Authors such as Jaime Carmona - Fonseca ( epidemiologist - virologist ) or Walter Salas - Zapata ( bacteriologist ) , both affiliated with Universidad de Antioquia , have a higher between - ness despite being outside the five main clusters . In sum , most of the authors are affiliated with local universities , compared to the CSE - PhySci . The CSE - SoSci network ( Fig 10 ) has a density of 0 . 128 and an average path length of 1 . 043 , which is the shortest in the study sample . It is also the smallest network , within which the flow of information is the most efficient . The principal component of the network comprises 33 . 33 % of the nodes , followed by the remaining clusters with 14 . 81 % , 11 . 11 % , and 7 . 41 % , respectively . The author with the highest betweenness is Carl Henrik Langebaek ( AAEP - 2009 ) , an anthropologist affiliated with Universidad de Los Andes . In the same cluster can be found Melanie J . Miller , an anthropologist at University of Otago , New Zealand ; and Sabrina C . Agarwal , an anthropologist at University of California , Berkeley . Both work in similar bioarch - aeological fields . Bibliographic coupling networks .

Nodes with a degree less than five were hidden from the layout to improve the structure’s interpretation . Fig 11 presents the PhySci bibliographic coupling network . Density equals 0 . 026 and the average path length is 3 . 56 , which means an average of ~ 4 steps for a random pair of nodes to reach each other via the shortest path , those nodes being a pair of coupled documents . The principal component of this network corresponds to : medicine / agricultural and biological sci - ences having 43 . 53 % of the network’s nodes , followed by physics and astronomy with 20 . 98 % ; biochemistry , genetics and molecular biology with 12 . 50 % ; 6 . 11 % for immunology and micro - biology ; and 2 . 95 % for mathematics . Even with the principal component mainly comprising articles classified in medicine , most articles with the highest property of mediating the flow / share of knowledge / references belonged to physics—with a marginal presence of articles on movement disorders ( e . g . , Parkinson’s disease ) . Fig 12 presents the EnvSci bibliographic coupling network . The density equals 0 . 058 with an average path length of 2 . 56 . Most of the network corresponds to the agricultural and biolog - ical sciences / earth and planetary sciences with 85 . 77 % nodes , followed by 1 . 80 % for chemical engineering . Documents with the highest betweenness were mostly articles in ( sub ) fields such as contamination and toxicology , ecology , geology , environmental economics , and molecular catalysis . There is also the involvement of a report from the IPCC - 2014 ( Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ) . Fig 13 presents the SoSci bibliographic coupling network . The network has a density of 0 . 051 with an average path length of 2 . 339 . The principal component is composed mainly of arts and humanities / social sciences , with 45 . 28 % of nodes . The document with the highest betweenness was on the history of land - use planning in Colombia . Most journals were devoted Fig 10 . Author collaboration network – SoSci .

Fig 14 presents a summary of the nodes and macro indices of the three types of networks presented above . The number of nodes is proportional to the number of articles in each CSE category . In contrast , the density is inversely proportional to the number of articles . The decreasing average path length reinforces this observation . In terms of institutional collaboration , the SoSci network has established more real than potential institutional collaborations , followed by EnvSci and PhySci . Accordingly , there are fewer intermediates between a pair of institutions than PhySci and EnvSci . On the other hand , the number of institutions in PhySci is almost ~ 6 times higher than EnvSci , and ~ 49 times higher than SoSci , giving PhySci a higher average path length . Compared to EnvSci , however , PhySci does not have over a complete intermediate institution in average . In contrast , there are on average ~ 2 different intermediate institutions between PhySci and SoSci . The coauthor - ship networks display similar patterns regarding the average number of intermediate authors for PhySci and SoSci . However , the EnvSci network showed the highest average path length with ~ 4 middle authors . Among the top - ten institutions , the PhySci collaboration network showed a direct collabo - ration between Universidad de Antioquia and Harvard University ( 161 Nobel Prizes ) . In EnvSci , Universidad de Los Andes , Nacional , Cartagena , and Valle , have at least one direct col - laboration with UNAM ( 3 Nobel Prizes ) . In SoSci , Universidad de Los Andes has a direct col - laboration with the University of California , Berkeley ( 110 Nobel Prizes ) . Thus , CSE institutions are embedded in a collaboration network with GSE institutions . In a more refined analysis at the authorship level , only two AAEPs have coauthored with GSE authors : Juan Camilo Ca´rdenas with Elinor Ostrom in What do people bring into the game ? Experiments in the field about cooperation in the commons ( 2004 ) ; and Nubia Mu ñ oz with Harald zur Hausen in Nasopharyngeal carcinoma . X .

The SoSci network was the most homogeneous network . In SoSci , despite the reduced number of research fronts , the average Fig 12 . Bibliographic coupling network – EnvSci .

The CSE and the GSE . Table 4 presents the citation indicators and Ci [ 55 ] . GSE was yel - low while CSE yellow - light colored . The six scientific impact and productivity indices are sepa - rated into two aspects : bulk impact ( total number of citations [ NC ] and h index [ H ] ) ; and authorship order adjusted impact ( Schreiber Hm index [ HM ] ; total citations for papers where the scientist is the single author [ NS ] ; total citations for papers where the scientist is the single or first author [ NSF ] ; and total citations for papers where the scientist is the single , first , or last author [ NSFL ] ) . As a reminder , Ci is calculated as the sum of the normalized log - transforma - tion of previous indexes . The normalization of 0 – 1 range values was computed according to each CSE and GSE . Each column is colored from dark ( higher score ) to light green ( lower ) . After dividing Ci into quartiles , Nubia Mu ñ oz ( medicine ) is the lone AAEP among the 4 th quartile . She also ranked 1 st in the NSF indicator . The appearance of Mu ñ oz in all the sections presented above , even in a direct comparison with the GSE , is explained by her contribution to the study of the human papillomavirus , which earned her a Nobel Prize nomination by the International Epidemiological Association . The highest was that of Alan J . Heeger ( chemistry ) . Among the 3 rd quartile , several AAEPs emerged : Germa´n Poveda Jaramillo ( earth and Fig 14 . Nodes and macro indices summary .

Thus , neither scientific elite was frac - tured into two mutually exclusive groups . Fig 15 displays the violin - box plot for each index and group . Discussion Most of the CSE has motivations / incentives other than publishing research in academic jour - nals . This is due to the AAEP’s broad scope in granting awards . Awards are granted not only for research articles , dissertations ( MSc / PhD ) , and books , but also for technical reports or books published by leading national institutions , such as IDEAM ( Institute of Hydrology , Meteorology and Environmental Studies ) or the Alexander von Humboldt Biological Resources Research Institute ( EnvSci ) ; or the National Centre for Historical Memory ; and NGOs such as Tropenbos International ( SoSci ) . In contrast , all GSEs 1990 – 2020 had publica - tions in Scopus . Yet , in all science categories , the GSE had a decreasing trend in annual growth output . At the individual level , this explains the temporary dip in GSE impact after winning the award and reduced productivity albeit with a higher impact [ 11 , 26 ] . The inverse relationship between age and productivity could be another explanatory factor since the average laureate age over the past 25 years is 44 . 1 ± 9 . 7 , those in physics being the youngest at 42 ± 12 . 5 [ 109 ] . Additional factors , as noted by Diamandis [ 110 ] in an opinion piece , are as follows : laureates receive the prize 20 – 50 years after their core contribution to their field , by which time they are past their prime ; they become less active in terms of research ; or their main contribution was a serendipitous one - hit - wonder . Also , we consider deceased Nobel laureates ( e . g . , Robert H . Grubbs or Paul J . Crutzen ) . Despite , for obvious reasons , they halt their research output , their influence and impact ( citations ) in research conducted after their retirement or passing affects their overall composite indicator . At the country level , research on endogenous growth sug - gests that ideas are getting harder to find and that more human and financial resources are required to maintain the same growth levels as those in previous decades ( e . g . , 18 times the number of researchers are required nowadays to double the chip density than was the case in the 1970s ) [ 111 ] . Several explanatory factors could be outlined here , such as reduced public funding , follow on innovations that produce smaller growth , or the fact that a third industrial revolution led by computers , the Internet , and mobile phones , produced only a stunted growth between 1996 – 2004 [ 112 ] . Conversely , the AAEP showed an increasing trend in all categories . It is important , how - ever , to consider the following growth comparison in the limited context of the study’s specific research sample and scale . The annual growth rate for each category ranges between < 1 % for SoSci and 6 . 67 % for EnvSci . Given that the annual growth rate for modern science post - WWII is ~ 9 % , the overall output growth figure of 2 . 97 % is below such an estimate [ 113 ] . The CSE’s overall growth was similar to that in the mid - 18 th century and between WWI and WWII ( ~ 3 % ) . In the context of developing countries , the average annual growth 1996 – 2018 in the fields of PhySci , EnvSci , and SoSci was 18 % [ 49 ] . Thus , even in the most prolific category ( EnvSci ) , the growth is below historical and disciplinary estimates but positive compared to that of the GSE . Two examples provide details on the CSE output / impact . A special case in terms of output is that of Ana Marı´a Rey ( PhySci ) and Juan Camilo Ca´rdenas ( EnvSci ) . Rey has coauthored multiple articles in most of the physics journals that publish Nobel Prize research [ 5 ] ( i . e . , Physical Review ; Science ; and Nature ) and has made contributions to fields such as solid states physics – a field that garnered a significant amount of Nobel Prizes in the 20 th century [ 14 ] . Ca´rdenas also has coauthored articles published in Science . His research PLOS ONE The Colombianscientificelite PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0269116 May 26 , 2022 24 / 34 PLOS ONE The Colombianscientificelite PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0269116 May 26 , 2022 25 / 34 topics include game theory , a field which was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1994 , 1996 , 2001 , 2005 , 2007 , 2012 and 2014 [ 114 ] . Our findings do not support the post - AAEP push effect in citations / article . While a few CSE members received the prize at the peak of their careers ( i . e . , Mu ñ oz - PhySci ; Montes - EnvSci ) , or after peaks ( i . e . , Ca´rdenas - EnvSci ) , others received the prize far earlier than their most crucial peak ( Velez - PhySci ) . Compared to the GSE—members of which received the Nobel prize at their peak , followed by a brief halo effect— there is no discernible halo effect for the CSE [ 22 , 115 ] . A halo effect is usually defined as a bias whereby an impression produced by a single trait ( i . e . , winning a Nobel Prize or an AAEP ) influences multiple judgments ( i . e . , the prize - winning researcher’s future research ) . A contributory factor could be the wide range of participants in the AAEP . Given that the AAEP annually awards diverse products , it is not nec - essary to be a committed researcher in order to trigger , sustain , or participate in a halo effect . This is not the case with the Nobel Prize . It is also important to mention the lack of sustained and well - funded research in Colombia [ 42 ] —a constraint that is likely to persist , resulting in intermittent productivity and impact [ 116 ] . National investment in science and technology activities , the leadership of public insti - tutions , and the building of a secure and protected research environment within which ideas can grow and flourish are essential factors that contribute to outstanding research outcomes . For instance , between 2000 – 2008 the GSE reported a successful record in funding Nobel Prize - winning research by the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Founda - tion in the US [ 117 ] . Even when a substantial fraction of such research is unfunded , public and private research institutions provide a protected and safe environment for brilliant researchers to explore and innovate ideas [ 117 ] . Several institutions with GSE members shared rankings with CSE institutions among the top - ten highest betweenness , particularly the PhySci network . For example , institutions such as Harvard University , University of California , Berkeley , and UNAM , showed a higher betweenness in each network . The public - private status of those institutions mirrored the institution networks of the CSE , which were also composed of the local university elite . Some of these universities are private ( i . e . , Los Andes , Javeriana ) , some public ( i . e . , Nacional , Antio - quia , Cartagena ) , but always featuring at the top of the regional rankings [ 65 ] . Research centers and agencies in the fields of agriculture and cancer also play an essential role . Thus , despite being high betweenness actors , it is mainly local , GSE - awarded institutions that rank among the top . This does not mean , however , that there is a direct collaboration between the CSE and the GSE – only two researchers had coauthored articles with Nobel laureates . Nevertheless , it supports the idea that Nobel Prize winners influence prize - winning networks and also reflects the brokerage role of the CSE as nodes in its respective coauthorship networks [ 26 ] . The strategic location of both the GSE and the CSE in the institutional collaboration net - works partly reinforces the point made by Jiang and Liu [ 64 ] : that top - tier institutions generate the most production and enticement of scientific elites , thereby aggravating the inequality between emergent or peripheral institutions and those with cumulative advantages . Further - more , faculty at high - prestige institutions drive the diffusion and influence of ideas , often irre - spective of quality ( e . g . , an idea spreads more rapidly if it originates from a prestigious institution than an idea of similar quality from a less prestigious institution ) [ 56 ] . Compared to PhySci and EnvSci , the SoSci institutional / coauthorship networks showed a lower density . Fig 15 .

However , it also comes with downsides such as redundant informa - tion and constraints upon actors’ options [ 118 ] . Conversely , in the open structure of PhySci and EnvSci , new ideas flow through weak ties , and actors with higher betweenness potentially receive strategic resources . Among the downsides , an open structure is not ideal for complex information flow , creates less trust , and complex communication requires more effort [ 118 ] . The latter was noticeable in the PhySci author network , where whole clusters were completely exiled from the network . Macro indices resembled those of previous bibliographic coupling networks modeled to test the Hierarchy of the Sciences hypothesis , particularly for PhySci [ 119 ] . The average path length of the PhySci bibliographic coupling network resembled the average path lengths in space science , and physics : 3 . 6 . The EnvSci network showed a lower average path length than the environment / ecology network : 3 . 7 . The consistent average path length in higher consensus ( i . e . , hardness ) disciplines / fields could be explained by references : fewer references are needed to justify / explain / support a study . This observation has to be contrasted with the diversity of disciplinary clusters in PhySci compared to EnvSci since hardness in science is characterized by the reduced diversity of sources used ( i . e . , fewer research topics of general interest ) . In other words , despite the AAEP being entitled physics and natural sciences , the prize has been granted to researchers with a higher diversity in their research fronts—on aggregate—com - pared to those with a lower diversity in EnvSci and SoSci . In specific cases , the CSE research fronts differ from Colombia’s national output focus . On the other hand , there are clear similarities when comparing the CSE with the main national output disciplines / areas according to ASJC classification . First , while the natural sciences lead national output ( mainly : ecology ; botany ; horticulture ; particle physics ; and zoology ) , the PhySci research front composed mainly of medicine was in 4 th place in the national output ranking . It is also important to bear in mind that the principal component of PhySci has signif - icant involvement in the agricultural and biological sciences , also reflected in the natural sci - ence national output . Similarly , in the case of EnvSci—and a substantial portion of the principal component in PhySci—the national output in agricultural sciences figured at the bot - tom . The second field in the principal component of EnvSci , earth and planetary science , is not significant in the national output . In contrast , the national output in SoSci figured in 2 nd place ( mainly welfare economics ; pedagogy ; epistemology ; law ; and social psychology ) , while the SoSci Scopus profiles were the least represented in the sample . Second , in terms of net out - put and after applying the ASJC classification to the CSE , the most frequent disciplines / areas ( i . e . , agricultural and biological sciences ; arts and humanities ; and medicine ) were also among those with the highest output in the country . Other national disciplines / areas by output were engineering and technology ( mainly artificial intelligence ; food science ; control theory ; analyt - ical chemistry ; and composite material ) , comprising < 1 % of the CSE after ASJC classification . This is also consonant with the marginal mathematics cluster in PhySci . Differences in such results need to be viewed with caution since national data was estimated using the Microsoft Academic Graph , which is the second source of bibliographic data in terms of references cov - ered after Google Scholar [ 120 ] . Scopus , on the other hand , was in third place in terms of refer - ences covered . Broadening international efforts related to the global development agenda , a comprehen - sive assessment of SDG using bibliographic coupling identified the following as the most sig - nificant clusters : maternal , newborn , and child morbidity and mortality ; ecosystems services and adaptations for sustainability ; and health surveys , tuberculosis , substance abuse , and lon - gevity [ 94 ] . In those areas , the most crowded research fronts of the CSE , PhySci and EnvSci in PLOS ONE The Colombianscientificelite PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0269116 May 26 , 2022 27 / 34 particular have the potential and strategic value to contribute to SDG’s core research and to participate in its global endeavor [ 121 ] . Using bulk impact and authorship adjustment indicators and their composite enabled a more nuanced and inclusive analysis between the CSE and the GSE . Our findings on the first two quartiles of Ci shed light on the local human and scientific profile , seasoned with Nobel productivity / impact features—something not visible either in the pure index of Nobel Prizes affiliated with universities or in Clarivate’s Highly Cited Researcher ranking . These changes , inclusions , and exclusions were also pointed out by Ioannidis et al . [ 55 ] when proposing the Ci ( e . g . , Nobel laureates ranked among the top - 1 , 000 , but would rank much lower if total citations alone were considered ) . Finding local names such as Luı´s Fernando Garcı´a between William C . Campbell or Riccardo Giacconi puts the knowledge produced by Colombian researchers and developing countries under a very different and encouraging light . The CSE could be found among the superior 50 % and the GSE among the inferior 50 % . Our findings also con - trast with previous findings on the lower research impact of authors from Latin America , despite their involvement as contributors to reputable journals [ 122 ] . A final note regarding Zuckerman’s pioneering work on the stratification in US Science and the CSE [ 9 , 10 ] . Zuckerman was particularly concerned about the growing inequality in the distribution of scientific recognition . We found evidence of this in the higher betweenness of institutions with a higher reputation at both local and global level , a reputation , moreover , that is substantially enhanced by having an AAEP awardee affiliated with such institutions . Zuckerman also pointed that—despite such inequality—‘no scientist is deprived of all the good things of the scientific life’ , including those in middle / lower positions [ 9 ] . We found this to be reflected in the eclectic and inclusive purpose of the AAEP that goes beyond the ‘ you must have a PhD to conduct research ’ or the ‘you must publish—research articles in English in top - tier journals—or perish . ’ Lastly , Zuckerman lauded science’s egalitarian ideology for the way in which it brings together various scientist strata , an interweaving feature and impact in science that emerged in our analysis of Ci results for both the CSE and the GSE . Conclusion This study aimed to provide a comprehensive analysis of the output , impact , and structure of the CSE . It also drew a comparison with the GSE using an impact and normalized authorship composite indicator . Our findings showed that the CSE has a broader agenda than indexed titles in internationally renowned bibliographic databases—mainly local - focused—including PhySci . The CSE showed positive growth compared to the negative growth of the GSE . There were no noticeable changes in productivity / impact among the most prolific researchers before and after receiving the AAEP . CSE - affiliated institutions with the highest betweenness are either local or international reputable institutions—in some cases , multiple Nobel awarded . At the direct coauthorship level , only two researchers published an article with a GSE member . Most of the research profiles reflected the national output priorities , but when research fronts are taken into consideration , the strategic research capacities diverge from the national focus . Ci produced an enriching comparison by showing the scope and reach of Colombian research - ers’ scientific impact in his / her disciplinary area , even when Nobel laureates are placed in the same assessment framework . The interleaving of the CSE and the GSE—particularly between the 3 rd and 2 nd quartiles—enabled a more nuanced analysis . Our findings shed light on the research performance - impact standards and agenda between the global North and South and provide an in - context assessment of outstanding local research . Our study has several limitations . First , the geopolitical scope of the study is limited to Colombia . Second , we did not consider macro - economic variables related to science and PLOS ONE The Colombianscientificelite PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0269116 May 26 , 2022 28 / 34 technology activities , such as public / private R & D investment ; research grants and scholar - ships ; mentoring ; or the correlation between an increased scientific workforce and its scientific impact on the CSE . Such variables could shed light on the potential role of confounding vari - ables . Third , the bibliographic data sourced from Scopus is not a complete picture of the schol - arly communication production in Colombia nor in Latin America and the Caribbean . Further research could source other scientific elites ( e . g . , Royal Society Africa Prize , Highest Science and Technology Award , China ; Prêmio Almirante Álavaro Alberto , Brazil ) , thereby deepening the understanding of research impact and structure in the context of developing regions / countries . Sourcing bibliographic data from search engines / databases with more com - prehensive coverage—such as Google Scholar or Dimensions—could generate further insights by including researchers with no publications in either Scopus or WoS . The inclusion of mac - roeconomic variables relating to science and technology activities together with the influence of these activities on the impact of the CSE and the national scientific workforce in general could add a socio - economic dimension , thereby yielding a more comprehensive outlook . Lastly , the inclusion of altmetrics could provide another perspective : on elites that lie beyond the academic community , such as public debates conducted via social media .
