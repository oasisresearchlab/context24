Here , we report measurements of the linear and nonlinear viscoelasticity of networks of two distinct intermediate ﬁlaments , vimentin and neuroﬁlaments . Both exhibit predominantly elastic behavior with strong nonlinear strain stiffening . We demonstrate that divalent ions behave as effective cross - linkers for both networks , and that the elasticity of these networks is consistent with the theory for that of semiﬂexible polymers .

Ka The mechanical response of cells depends largely on the structure and elasticity of their cytoskeleton , consisting of a variety of biopolymer networks , including ﬁlamentous actin , microtubules , and intermediate ﬁlaments ( IFs ) [ 1 ] . While ﬁlamentous actin and microtubules have been ex - tensively studied , much less is known about IFs , although some key parameters such as their persistence length have been measured . Compared to actin and microtubules , IFs are more varied and specialized . Their networks are never - theless cytoskeletal components contributing to the elas - ticity of the cell : there are ﬁve families of IFs found in a variety of cell types , ranging from muscles to neurons . Intermediate ﬁlament networks exhibit pronounced non - linear elasticity similar to that observed in actin networks that are cross - linked . However , there are myriad associated actin - binding proteins that lead to this cross - linking ; by contrast , fewer cross - linking proteins have been identiﬁed for IFs . Thus , the origin of the nonlinear elasticity in IF networks has not been identiﬁed . Here , we investigate the elasticity of two different IF networks , vimentin and neuroﬁlaments ( NFs ) . The net - works exhibit remarkably similar mechanical properties : they are weak elastic solids even at the lowest frequencies probed and they exhibit strong nonlinear strain stiffening over several decades in stress . This behavior requires cross - linking of the network and we show that divalent ions act as effective cross - linkers . By comparing the linear and nonlinear macroscopic behavior , we extract micro - scopic network parameters . These observations suggest a general design principle for regulating the elasticity of intermediate ﬁlament networks even in the absence of speciﬁc cross - linking proteins . To explore the generality of this behavior , we use NFs , found only in neurons , and vimentin , found in nearly all mesenchymal cells . The main difference between these IFs lies in the length of their negatively charged carboxy terminal sidearms ; NF sidearms are much longer than those of vimentin . Furthermore , optimal assembly is ob - tained at different ionic conditions , with NFs favoring a p H of 6 . 2 , where vimentin does not assemble properly [ 2 ] . Neuroﬁlaments are puriﬁed from bovine spinal cords [ 3 – 5 ] : fresh tissue is homogenized , then centrifuged , after which the crude NF pellet is puriﬁed overnight on a dis - continuous sucrose gradient with 0 . 8 M sucrose ( 5 . 9 ml ) , 1 . 5 M sucrose ( 1 . 3 ml ) and 2 . 0 M sucrose ( 1 . 0 ml ) . The puriﬁed NF is then dialyzed for 76 hours and 120 ! l aliquots are ﬂash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at ! 80 " C . Human vimentin protein is expressed in Escherichia coli and puriﬁed from inclusion bodies [ 6 ] . The protein is stored at ! 80 " C in 8 M urea , 5 mM Tris - HCl ( p H 7 . 5 ) , 1 mM DTT , 1 mM EDTA , 0 . 1 mM EGTA , and 10 mM methyl ammonium chloride . Twenty - four hours before use , we renature the protein from 8 M urea by stepwise dialysis ( 6 M , 4 M , 2 M ) into a solution of 5 mM Tris - HCl , p H 8 . 4 , 1 mM EDTA , 0 . 1 mM EGTA , and 1 mM DTT . The protein concentration is determined using a Bradford assay with bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) as a standard . The mechanical response of intermediate ﬁlament net - works is measured with a stress - controlled rheometer using a 2 " 20 mm cone - plate geometry for NFs and a 40 mm plate - plate geometry for vimentin ( HR Nano , Malvern Instruments ) . Before rheological testing , neuroﬁlament samples are thawed on ice , after which , varying concen - trations of Mg 2 þ are added . Vimentin polymerization is initiated by adding Mg 2 þ and 1 = 10 of the ﬁnal sample volume of 10X polymerization buffer ( 0 . 2 M Tris - HCl , p H 7 . 0 , containing 1 . 6 M NaCl ) . The samples are quickly loaded onto the rheometer and polymerized between the rheometer plates for 1 h at 25 " C , using a solvent trap to prevent drying . We measure the linear viscoelastic moduli G 0 ð ! Þ , G 00 ð ! Þ . In addition , we use large amplitude oscil - latory measurements to qualify the network’s nonlinearity . To quantify the nonlinear behavior we utilize a differential measurement [ 7 , 8 ] . The system is held at a constant aver - age ( pre - ) stress " , while the differential response d # to a PRL 104 , 058101 ( 2010 ) P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S week ending 5 FEBRUARY 2010 0031 - 9007 = 10 = 104 ( 5 ) = 058101 ( 4 ) 058101 - 1 ! 2010 The American Physical Society small additional oscillatory stress d " is measured to yield the nonlinear tangent modulus K ¼ d " = d # . We ﬁrst probe the frequency dependence of the linear viscoelastic moduli . Consistent with other biopolymer net - works , both G 0 , G 00 depend weakly on frequency ( from 0 . 01 – 10 Hz ) , with G 0 much larger than G 00 , as shown in Fig . 1 ( a ) . This suggests the existence of soft cross - linked gels . We characterize the linear elasticity by the plateau modulus , G 0 , the value of G 0 ð ! Þ at 0 . 1 Hz . Interestingly , for purely entangled networks of similar size and concen - tration , we would expect the moduli of the two IF networks to be comparable ; the fact that NFs are about an order of magnitude stiffer can be accounted for by cross - linking . The networks also exhibit dramatic strain stiffening above a critical strain # c , as shown in Fig . 1 ( b ) . For both IFs , the elasticity depends strongly on the polymer concentration and also on the concentration of Mg 2 þ added to the solution [ 9 ] . By analogy to prior studies of biopolymer networks [ 8 , 10 ] , we examine the depen - dence on IF concentration , c IF , at a ﬁxed mole ratio , R of Mg 2 þ to IF . For both vimentin and NFs , the linear elastic modulus increases with ﬁlament concentration in a way similar to cross - linked biopolymer networks , in that the modulus scales slightly stronger than quadratically with ﬁlament concentration , as shown in Fig . 2 ( a ) . This is con - sistent with a theoretical model for cross - linked semiﬂex - ible polymers , in which the elasticity is dominated by entropic ﬁlament stretching ; in this afﬁne thermal model , the ﬁlaments are considered to be entropic springs , leading to G 0 ’ c 11 = 5 IF [ 11 ] . In addition , we also ﬁnd that G 0 scales directly with c Mg , as shown in Fig . 2 ( b ) , demonstrating the role of Mg 2 þ in the network elasticity for both IFs . To elucidate the role of Mg 2 þ , we investigate the non - linear elastic regime by probing the differential moduli [ 8 ] . Above a critical stress " c , both IF networks display pro - nounced nonlinear stiffening with applied stress , exhibit - ing an approximate power law of 3 = 2 , as shown in Fig . 3 . This is consistent with theoretical expectations and pre - vious experiments for cross - linked networks [ 8 , 10 – 12 ] . Interestingly , the predictions of the afﬁne thermal model apply for networks cross - linked by molecular linkers and experiments have focused on actin - linkers such as scruin . The absence of molecular linkers in these IF networks suggests that ions may be playing the role of permanent effective molecular cross - links , lending insight into the nature of ionic interactions in IF networks . Previously , these ionic interactions have been understood within a framework of condensed counterions and salt - bridging on polyelectrolyte brushes [ 13 – 15 ] . We hypothesize that Mg 2 þ mediates attractive interactions between the nega - tively charged sidearms of the IFs thereby forming perma - nent cross - links analogous to molecular linkers . In particular , IF sidearms are likely collapsed ﬂexible chains , and the cross - linking interactions would be mediated by a collection of divalent ions interwoven into the entangled sidearm structure . Although sidearms of a single chain will likely cross - link within themselves , only cross - linking be - tween different chains will contribute to network elasticity . Since neuroﬁlament sidearms are much longer than those of vimentin , their cross - linking may be more effective , accounting for the higher shear moduli and yield stresses observed for NF networks . Theoretically we expect a universal form for the nonlinear elastic response of the networks for all protein and ion concentrations . The data sets from both neuroﬁlament and vimentin networks can , indeed , be scaled onto a single master curve , which is in good agreement with the theoretical prediction shown by the solid line in the inset of Fig . 3 [ 8 , 10 ] . Here , we ﬁt each data set to the full theoretical curve , using two independent parameters : " is scaled by " c , while K 0 is scaled by the linear elastic modulus G 0 . For both networks , we ﬁnd excellent agreement with theory over approximately four decades in stress , although vimentin departs from the theoretical master curve at the highest stresses . This de - parture may be explained by considering the enthalpic contribution of ﬁlament backbone stretching [ 16 ] , suggest - FIG . 1 ( color online ) .

In particular , utilizing an extensible wormlike chain model we are able to estimate vimentin’s Young’s modulus to be approximately 9 MPa [ 17 , 18 ] . To further probe the mechanism of the network elastic - ity , we test the predicted relationship between G 0 and " c . Assuming an afﬁne deformation , theory predicts the curve shown in the inset of Fig . 3 , with G 0 ¼ 6 $ k B T l 2 p l 3 c and " c ¼ $ k B T l p l 2 c : ( 1 ) Here , k B is Boltzmann’s constant , T is the temperature , $ is the ﬁlament density in length per volume , l p is the persis - tence length , and l c is the average distance between cross - links [ 8 , 10 , 11 , 19 ] . Since $ / c IF , the model predicts that c 1 = 2 IF G 0 ’ " 3 = 2 c , where the prefactor should depend only on k B T and l p . In particular , this relationship is predicted to be independent of l c , so that even data sets with different cross - link densities should collapse onto a single curve . Both vimentin and NF networks agree with this data col - lapse and scaling for a variety of different ﬁlament and Mg 2 þ concentrations , as shown in Fig . 4 . In the case of NFs , the generality of this ionic cross - linking behavior is depicted by a qualitative collapse onto the same curve for other divalent ions such as Ca 2 þ and Zn 2 þ . This scaling relates the linear elasticity of the networks to the stress at which nonlinear behavior begins as the ﬁlaments approach their full extension ; therefore , it is independent of the scaling of K 0 with " in Fig . 3 . This provides strong evi - dence that the linear elasticity of IF networks is also governed by entropic stretching . The relative shift between the two curves in Fig . 4 . can be explained by a difference in persistence lengths of the ﬁlaments . Remarkably , we can determine l p directly from the macroscopic network behavior under shear , l p ¼ 1 36 $ k B T G 20 " 3 c ; ( 2 ) where $ ( 0 : 5 ) 10 13 m ! 2 for both IF networks at a con - centration of 4 ! M . We ﬁnd that for NFs , l p ( 0 : 2 ! m , while for vimentin , l p ( 0 : 5 ! m ; both of these values are in good accord with previous experiments [ 20 – 23 ] . Furthermore , we also determine the cross - link density , l c ¼ 6 l p " c G 0 ; ( 3 ) where we have obtained l p directly from bulk rheological parameters using Eq . ( 2 ) . Direct determination of l c is difﬁcult and has rarely been made in such systems [ 24 ] . Here , we ﬁnd that l c ( 0 : 3 ! m for NFs and l c ( 0 : 6 ! m for vimentin . This is consistent with our hypothesis that the ﬁlaments are cross - linked on the scale l p and thus the networks can be characterized as semiﬂexible . To further examine the behavior of Mg 2 þ as a cross - linker , we consider the scaling of l c as a function of both R and c IF [ Eq . ( 3 ) ] . Cross - linking occurs on the scale of the entanglement length l e , which scales as c ! 2 = 5 IF [ 11 , 18 ] . Since our data suggest that Mg 2 þ is effectively a cross - linker , we expect l c to scale with R ! x for some exponent x [ 8 , 10 ] . Indeed , the data exhibit an approximate scaling , l c ’ R ! x c ! y IF ¼ c ! x Mg c ! y þ x IF ; x is approximately 0 . 23 for both IFs , measured at ﬁxed c IF , and y ( 0 : 4 for vimentin and y ( 0 : 5 for neuroﬁlaments , measured at ﬁxed R , as shown in Fig . 5 . Interestingly , the larger value of y for NFs is consistent with the correspondingly stronger concentration FIG . 4 ( color online ) . The dependence of c 1 = 2 IF G 0 on " c .

The inset shows the data sets rescaled by " c and G 0 depicting the universal form of the stiffening response ; the rescaled theory is indicated by the dashed red line , while the solid black line depicts the deviation due to enthalpic backbone stretching .

This may be a consequence of denser cross - linking ; then we expect G 0 ’ c 5 = 2 NF [ 11 ] . Furthermore , as a consistency check for the value of x , we can also determine it directly from the c Mg dependence of G 0 . Inserting a scaling of l c ’ R ! x into Eq . ( 1 ) gives G 0 ’ c 3 x Mg , holding c IF constant . Based on the scaling of G 0 in Fig . 2 ( b ) , we ﬁnd x ( 0 : 20 , in good accord with the value measured directly from the c Mg dependence of l c . Both the excellent agreement with theory and the internal consistency of our measurements provides convincing evi - dence that Mg 2 þ effectively cross - links IF networks . Moreover , we ﬁnd similar behavior for Ca 2 þ and Zn 2 þ . The values we observe for G 0 and the maximum stress are consistent with most previous experiments [ 1 , 5 ] , although one experiment with NFs yielded a smaller modu - lus and solution like behavior [ 25 ] . Remarkably , we can extract the microstructural parameters l p and l c directly from bulk rheology ; values of l p are consistent with pre - vious measurements [ 20 ] , while values of l c are compa - rable to the expected mesh size % ( 1 = ﬃﬃﬃﬃ $ p . Compared with vimentin , NFs consistently exhibit smaller values of l c , suggesting a more densely cross - linked network ; this may result from the longer NF sidearms and concomitantly stronger electrostatic interactions . Measurements based on probe particle motion in IF networks have suggested larger values of % [ 25 ] ; however , recent measurements yield results which are more consistent with the expected value [ 26 ] . In addition , results from direct imaging clearly show % of order a few hundred nanometers . Vimentin and NF networks show striking similarity in their linear and nonlinear elastic behavior , both of which are governed by cross - linking due to divalent ions . Intriguingly , divalent ions play a role nearly identical to that of molecular cross - linkers in F - actin networks . This suggests that there is a strong afﬁnity of the divalent ions to the IFs ; thus , a large fraction of the ions must be bound hence becoming effective molecular cross - links . Despite the similarities in their mechanical behavior , the nonlinear rheology of vimentin shows a clear departure from that of NFs at the highest stresses ; this results from the enthalpic contribution of ﬁlament backbone stretching [ 16 ] . By con - trast NFs do not exhibit a measurable ﬁlament compliance , implying that their Young’s modulus is larger than that of vimentin ; this is surprising given the similar molecular architecture of the backbone of the two IFs . Interestingly , this may reﬂect another important role of the sidearms : they might also affect the enthalpic stretching of ﬁlaments . However , this conclusion is based on macroscopic rheol - ogy , and direct force - extension measurements of individual ﬁlament stretching are needed to conﬁrm this . Such ﬁla - ment extension experiments may also elucidate the nature of the electrostatic interactions that mediate effective mo - lecular cross - linking between IFs .
