Metropolitans suffered serious 10 pandemic problems as the built environments of metropolitans contain a large number of 11 people in a relatively small area and allow frequent contacts to let virus spread through 12 people’s contacting with each other . The spread inside a metropolitan is heterogeneous , and 13 we propose that the spatial variation of built environments has a measurable association with 14 the spread of COVID - 19 . This paper is the pioneering work to investigate the missing link 15 between the built environment and the spread of the COVID - 19 . In particular , we intend to 16 examine two research questions : ( 1 ) What are the association of the built environment with 17 the risk of being infected by the COVID - 19 ? ( 2 ) What are the association of the built 18 environment with the duration of suffering from COVID - 19 ? Using the Hong Kong census 19 data , confirmed cases of COVID - 19 between January to August 2020 and large size of built 20 environment sample data from the Hong Kong government , our analysis are carried out . The 21 data is divided into two phases before ( Phase 1 ) and during the social distancing measure was 22 relaxed ( Phase 2 ) . Through survival analysis , ordinary least squares analysis , and count data 23 analysis , we find that ( 1 ) In Phase 1 , clinics and restaurants are more likely to influence the 24 prevalence of COVID - 19 . In Phase 2 , public transportation ( i . e . MTR ) , public market , and 25 the clinics influence the prevalence of COVID - 19 . ( 2 ) In Phase 1 , the areas of tertiary 26 planning units ( i . e . , TPU ) with more restaurants are found to be positively associated with the 27 period of the prevalence of COVID - 19 . In Phase 2 , restaurants and public markets induce 28 long time occurrence of the COVID - 19 . ( 3 ) In Phase 1 , restaurant and public markets are the 29 two built environments that influence the number of COVID - 19 confirmed cases . In Phase 2 , 30 the number of restaurants is positively related to the number of COVID - 19 reported cases . It 31 is suggested that governments should not be too optimistic to relax the necessary measures . 32 In other words , the social distancing measure should remain in force until the signals of the 33 COVID - 19 dies out . 34 35 Keywords : COVID - 19 ; Built Environment ; Social distancing measures ; census data 36 37 1 . Introduction 38 The coronavirus pandemic , also known as COVID - 19 , appeared in December 2019 soon 39 spread all over the world ( Hui et al . , 2020 ) . The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 is of 40 very - high - concern to the public , and it affects different industries and economies . According 41 1 Email addresses : t . l . yip @ polyu . edu . hk ( Tsz Leung Yip ) , yaoxuanhuang @ hotmail . com ( Yaoxuan Huang , corresponding author ) , cliang @ ouhk . edu . hk ( Cong Liang ) J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 2 to the recent report from the World Health Organization ( JHU , 2020 ) , there are over 20 42 million confirmed cases of COVID - 19 , of which 13 million recovered and 0 . 7 million 43 fatalities are reported in more than 188 countries and territories up to July 15 , 2020 . The 44 transmission of COVID - 19 virus through large droplet transmission , aerosol transmission , 45 and indirect fomite . This virus infection rate is much higher than the Severe Acute 46 Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Disease ( SARS - CoV ) in 2003 . And the human - to - human 47 and zoonotic ( between human and animals ) transmission have been drastically boosting the 48 potential reach of the virus outbreak , especially in the metropolitans with a large population 49 and concrete jungles . 50 51 To date , no effective vaccine or special treatment is available for infected individuals . 52 Therefore , the governments of different countries have to rely on non - pharmaceutical 53 intervention ( NPI ) , including city lockdown , travel restriction , contact tracing , self - quarantine , 54 and social distancing , to suppress the coronavirus spread . The metropolitans with a high - 55 density population face great threats from the virus and call for more stringent NPI . Yet the 56 effectiveness of the NPI is varied among different countries or territories . In Asia , Korea and 57 Vietnam responded aggressively from the beginning of the pandemic , and now slowly move 58 back to normal without observing new outbreaks . The city of Hong Kong is a typical 59 metropolitan in the world and contains 7 . 5 million residents living in a small geographic area 60 of 1 , 100 km2 . Hong Kong government took early and prompt intervention at the outset of the 61 pandemic and it was nearly unscathed at the early stage . However , it declared to be back to 62 normal in June , leading to a new wave of the outbreak of COVID - 19 and over 4800 63 confirmed cases accumulated at the end of August 2020 ( Figure 1 ) . Hong Kong was one of 64 few metropolitans that were not locked down during the observed period and in which Hong 65 Kongers were free to commute , although they may change travel behaviours and frequencies . 66 67 The outbreak of COVID - 19 piqued the researchers’ interest . The studies in the early stages 68 reported that the transmission rate of COVID - 19 was influenced by demographic and social 69 attributes such as age and gender difference ( Kraemer et al . , 2020 ; Wenham et al . , 2020 ; Jia 70 et al . , 2020 ) . Risk reduction relied on intensive NPI ( Anderson et al . , 2020 ; Koo et al . , 2020 ; 71 Prem et al . , 2020 ) . Through inspired by the early studies , some recent studies ( Zhang et al . , 72 2020 ; Cadoni and Gaeta , 2020 ; Dolbeault and Turinici , 2020 ; Pang , 2020 ) attempted to 73 investigate the effectiveness of the NPI via mathematical analysis or simulation studies . 74 Zhang et al . ( 2020 ) proposed an agent - based SEIIR model to study the impacts of various 75 NPI on suppressing the infection of COVID - 19 in Shenzhen , China . They found that 76 quarantining recent individuals visit Hubei Province , shortening the time period from 77 symptom onset to hospital admission , and let symptomatic individuals self - quarantined at 78 home are the three most important NPIs to suppress the risk of infection in Shenzhen . Cadoni 79 and Gaeta ( 2020 ) simulated the impact of maintaining social distance on controlling the 80 epidemic diffusion . They argued that early detection and prompt self - quarantine would be 81 more effective ( than keeping social distance ) to reduce coronavirus transmission . Dolbeault 82 and Turinici ( 2020 ) studied how city lockdown would affect the infection rate in France in a 83 qualitative manner . They found that even a large number of the population abided by the 84 lockdown arrangement , while a small fraction of the people who are health workers still have 85 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 3 to maintain some certain level of social interactions , is not enough to control the outbreak . 86 Pang ( 2020 ) measured the lockdown policy on the spread of COVID - 19 by incorporating the 87 asymptomatic transmissions into the mathematical model . The findings are that the lockdown 88 policy shows limited effects on the asymptomatic viral carriers . 89 90 Nonetheless , the existing COVID - 19 studies assume that the execution of the NPI may 91 generate similar effects for different areas in the city . Some recent reports outline that the 92 spread rate of COVID - 19 is varied across different areas ( CHP , 2020a ) . The impact of the 93 different communities ( characterized by built environments ) on the spread of COVID - 19 are 94 overlooked , which may not provide a holistic view of how to implement the NPI to suppress 95 the virus effectively for the city governors . In a broad sense , the built environment includes 96 our homes , schools , workplaces , recreation areas , business areas , and roads ( Jelks et al . , 97 2018 ) . Considering that the outbreak of the COVID - 19 is most likely related to our living 98 environment , therefore the built environment in this paper includes locations where people 99 may have social interactions such as restaurants , private and public housing areas , public 100 markets , subway stations , and clinics . 101 102 To our best knowledge , people spend most of their time inside the built environment , 103 COVID - 19 can be transmitted through air , direct and indirect contact when individuals move 104 inside the built environment ( Megahed and Ghoneim , 2020 ) . In the literature of building and 105 environment , a growing number of studies have unveiled the mysterious transmission 106 mechanism of COVID - 19 inside the built environment . Cheng et al . ( 2020 ) formulated the 107 motion and the large respiratory droplets trajectories by employing a simplified single - droplet 108 approach . They suggested that maintaining a safe social distance of about 2 meters is 109 necessary . Mao et al . ( 2020 ) performed a comprehensive review of the transmission 110 mechanism and risks of viral infections by infectious droplets at different time . They show 111 that large droplets are of high transmission risk than that of small droplets . Zhou and Ji ( 2020 ) 112 take took a typical fever clinic as the study objected to [ do you mean objective ? Or attempted ] 113 consider the issues of cross - infection in terms of the transport of droplets generated by 114 patients and doctors . They concluded that the risk of infection is negatively associated with 115 the distance from occupants . Despite the above studies disclose the relationship between the 116 droplets and virus transmission of COVID - 19 , yet their settings are either considered as the 117 general case ( Cheng et al . , 2020 ; Mao et al . , 2020 ) or limited in the clinic ( or hospital ) 118 environment ( Zhou and Ji , 2020 ) . One exceptional example is research conducted by Blocken 119 et al . ( 2020 ) . They intended to investigate the challenges of re - opening the in - door sports 120 facilities . They advocated that cardio training ; workout training with weights ; non - contact 121 group exercises in classes could partially be restarted outside provided that the outdoor space 122 is available and the weather allows . Among the most recent publications in the existing 123 literature of building and environment , the problem of what which specific types of the built 124 environment are of a high risk of infecting COVID - 19 is understudied . To identify in what 125 specific built environments we bear a high risk of being infected by COVID - 19 should be our 126 priority concern before deep diving into discussing the transmission mechanism of COVID - 127 19 . 128 129 We are therefore motivated by the proposition that the spread of COVID - 19 is related to the 130 aspects of the built environments . In this study , we would like to explore two research 131 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 4 questions : ( 1 ) What are the association of the built environment with the risk of being 132 infected by the COVID - 19 ? ( 2 ) What are the association of the built environment with the 133 duration of suffering from COVID - 19 ? To address these 2 questions , we will use a massive 134 data set from the Hong Kong government ( i . e . the census statistics , confirmed cases of 135 COVID - 19 in Hong Kong as well as built environment data in Hong Kong ) , and employ 136 three different empirical models to analyze two dependent variables ( the cumulative number 137 of infected cases and the duration to the first confirmed cases ) across tertiary planning unites 138 ( TPU ) over two phases . The investigation of these two research questions is timely , and this 139 paper documents the spatial variations of the metropolitan built environment and the COVID - 140 19 spread , which have not been jointly studied yet . The findings would help the city 141 governors and authorities to make some necessary NPI allocate sufficient resources for the 142 different built environments to control the virus spread . 143 144 The structure of this paper is organized as follows . After a brief introduction , we discuss the 145 study area , data , and variables in Section 2 . Section 3 portrays the research method . Section 4 146 summarizes the results and findings . Section 5 addresses the conclusion . 147 148 2 . Study Area , Data and Variable 149 2 . 1 Study Area 150 The city of Hong Kong lies in the southern part of China . The total land area is 1 , 106 km2 , of 151 which about 24 % ( i . e . 268 km 2 ) and 4 % ( i . e . 43 km 2 ) are existing built - up areas and areas 152 under planning studies , respectively ( HKPD , 2016 ) . The remaining land area ( i . e . 72 % of the 153 total land ) is left for green areas , ecologically sensitive areas , and hilly terrain ( HKPD , 2016 ) . 154 With reference to the recent demographical report from the Hong Kong government , the 155 population is around 7 , 524 , 100 ( CSD , 2019 ) . In other words , the average population density 156 of Hong Kong is about 6 , 802 persons per km 2 on a territorial scale . If only the built - up areas 157 are considered , the average population density is as high as 28 , 075 persons per km 2 . To make 158 good use of limited land resources , Hong Kong follows the pattern of high - rise and high - 159 density development . It functions well in Hong Kong compared to other well - developed 160 cities in the U . S . and Europe . However , the high - rise and high - density development in Hong 161 Kong has inevitably generated some potential problems for anti - COVID - 19 , as the densely 162 living environment may boost the potential reach and such that the built environment that 163 allows people have social interactions may be of the high risk of being infected by COVID - 164 19 . 165 166 2 . 2 Data 167 Three sets of data have been sourced and collected in this study . The first set is the semi - 168 decennial census statistics of 2016 , which is obtained from the Hong Kong Census and 169 Statistical Department . This data set documents the demographical information in the tertiary 170 planning units ( TPU ) level . The TPU is a geographic reference system demarcated by the 171 Hong Kong Planning Department ( HKPD ) for the Territory of Hong Kong , which is similar 172 to the tract - level census in the U . S . According to the HKPD , the city of Hong Kong is divided 173 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 5 into 291 TPUs , incorporating the TPU boundaries and demographic information . For those 174 TPUs that are less than 1000 people , the census statistics would be merged in the adjacent 175 TPUs for the sake of protecting the privacy of individual household and personal records 176 ( CSD , 2020 ) . As such , there are in total 154 TPUs , including the merged TPUs and single 177 TPU are reported in 2016 census statistics . Apart from the 2016 census statistics ( the most 178 up - to - date official records of the census statistics in Hong Kong ) , the usage of this static 179 record in the following study is legit as there are no significant changes in the demographic 180 factors since the outbreak of COVID - 19 in Hong Kong . 181 182 The second set of data utilized in this study comes from the Department of Health in Hong 183 Kong . This set of data details the information of COVID - 19 confirmed cases , where the 184 COVID - 19 confirmed cases were reported based on the testing results from the Hong Kong 185 government recognized hospitals ( CHP , 2020b ) . It also contains the information of the 186 location / building where the confirmed cases resided , and the date at which the confirmed 187 cases was reported . The time span of this set of data is between January 8 , 2020 , and August 188 30 , 2020 . As of August 30 , 2020 , a total of 4 , 802 COVID - 19 confirmed cases are reported in 189 which some are the imported cases who are non - HK residents and do not have permanent 190 local addresses . In this regard , only residents who have permanent / living addresses would be 191 used for the following analysis and they are 3 , 884 confirmed cases in total . 192 193 The third set of data employed in this study records the information of the built environment , 194 which consists of information about residential buildings , transportation , clinic , public 195 markets . The location information as regards the built environment is static . In specific , 196 17 , 540 records of residential buildings , including private housing and public housing , are 197 obtained from the website of the Home Affairs Department in Hong Kong , 15 , 458 records of 198 restaurants and 67 records of public markets are collected from the Food and Environmental 199 Hygiene Department in Hong Kong , 2421 records of private clinics are from the website of 200 Electronic Health Record Sharing System in Hong Kong . The information of 426 subway 201 entrances is from the website of the Mass Transit Rail Company ( i . e . , MTR ) . 202 203 2 . 3 Variables 204 By geocoding the addresses of the COVID - 19 confirmed cases and the built environment 205 data , we link up the demographic information , residential building information , and built 206 environmental information to the TPU . 207 208 As indicated by recent studies ( Kraemer et al . , 2020 ; Wenham et al . , 2020 ; Jin et al . , 2020 ) , 209 the distribution of COVID - 19 confirmed cases is influenced by demographic and social 210 factors ( i . e . , age and population density ) , therefore the population of TPU ( Population ) , the 211 median level of domestic household size in TPU ( HSize ) , the number of labor work in TPU 212 where they do not live in ( WorkDT ) , the percentage of people aged 65 or above is over 20 % 213 in TPU ( Age65 _ O20 ) , and the percentage of population 65 or above is between 14 % and 20 % 214 ( Age65 _ 14 ) are selected as the control variables . 215 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 6 216 In this study , we pay special interest to the built environment variables , including the number 217 of people living in public housing ( Pub _ Housing ) , whether the public housing dominated in 218 the TPU ( i . e . over 50 % , PublicDom ) , coverage of public housing in the TPU ( Pert _ Pub ) , 219 number of private clinics ( N _ Clinic ) , the number of restaurants in the TPU ( N _ Restaurant ) , 220 the number of public markets in the TPU ( N _ PublicMarket ) , number of entrances of the mass 221 transit railway ( i . e . MTR ) ( N _ MTRE ) , the median value of the closest distance to the built 222 environmental attributes ( D _ Clinic , D _ Restaurant , D _ PublicMarket , and D _ MTRE ) . The 223 closest distance refers to the distance from the residential building to the nearest built 224 environmental attributes , which is the straight line between the residential building and the 225 nearest built environmental attributes . The closest distance is produced by ArcGIS 10 . 2 . 226 227 Apart from the control variables and interested variables , the number of COVID - 19 228 confirmed cases are used as the dependent variables in this study . These data sets are divided 229 into two phases over time , which are Phase 1 and Phase 2 . The period of Phase 1 covers the 230 period from January 8 to June 15 ( including June 15 ) , while time span of Phase 2 is between 231 June 16 and August 30 . The cut - off point is set as June 16 that is the date when the Hong 232 Kong Government executed the policy of relaxing the social distancing measure that allows 233 up to 50 people gathering and social interaction ( HKSAR , 2020a ) . Accordingly , the 234 dependent variables selected in these two phases correspond to two different phases ( before 235 and after relaxing the social distancing measure ) . Based on the reported COVID - 19 data , we 236 have done some simple calculations to generate key dependent variables . It is the period 237 between the starting day the Hong Kong government monitored the COVID - 19 and the 238 official reported date of the first COVID - 19 confirmed case in each TPU . The first set of 239 dependent variables ( DurFCJJ and DurFCJA , Table 1 ) documents the duration until the TPU 240 becomes infectious from the normal status . The consideration of these two variables 241 ( DurFCJJ and DurFCJA , in Table 1 ) enables us to address the first research question . Also , 242 the duration between the first and the last reported COVID - 19 cases in Phase 1 ( DurFP , Table 243 1 ) and 2 ( DurSP , Table 1 ) are considered as the alternative sets of dependent variables . Last 244 but not least , the number of COVID - 19 confirmed cases reported in Phase 1 ( CasesFP , Table 245 1 ) and Phase 2 ( CasesSP , Table 1 ) would be pondered as the third set of dependent variables 246 in this study . The consideration of DurFP , DurSP , CasesFP , and CasesSP allows us to 247 examine the second research question . The descriptive statistics are summarized in Table 1 . 248 The distribution of COVID - 19 cases in Phase 1 and Phase 2 are shown in Figure 2a and 249 Figure 2b . The distribution of residential buildings , restaurants , clinics , public markets , and 250 the MTR entrances are shown in Figure 3a - 3e respectively . 251 < insert Table 1 > 252 < insert Figure 2a - 2b > 253 < insert Figure 3a - 3e > 254 255 3 . Research Methodology 256 3 . 1 Design for analysis 257 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 7 As the time span of the collected data covers 8 months ( i . e . from January 2020 to August 258 2020 ) , during which the Hong Kong government issued three important policies related to 259 COVID - 19 . They are social distancing measures ( from March 28 to June 15 ) , relaxed social 260 distancing measures ( from June 16 to July 14 ) , and tightened social distancing measures 261 ( from July 15 onwards ) . It is not appropriate to perform the data analysis without considering 262 the circumstance in which social distancing measures are tightened or relaxed . In this regard , 263 the exploration of the research questions will be carried out by dividing the study period into 264 two phases ( Figure 4 ) . The cut - off point is set as June 16 as the date when the social 265 distancing measure was relaxed and other NPIs were adjusted . In each phase , we will first 266 conduct the survival analysis , where the results provide the answer to the first research 267 question . Afterward , the risk analysis and the count data analysis will be performed to seek 268 out the answer to the second research question . Detailed information about the model and 269 method for these three analyses will be disclosed in the following two sections . 270 271 3 . 2 Survival analysis for the association between the built environment and COVID - 19 272 To examine the first research question of what the association of the built environment is 273 with the risk of being infected by the COVID - 19 , the Cox proportional hazards regression 274 ( hereafter Cox model ) is adopted . The advantage of the Cox model is its flexibility to adjust 275 the association of the potential confounder ( Van Stralen et al . , 2010 ) . To be specific , the built 276 environment such as exposure to restaurants , clinics , public markets , and transportation 277 service locations are considered as risk factors . The consideration of the Cox model is to link 278 these risk factors to the survival time , where the survival time in the TPU refers to the period 279 that between the starting day to monitor the situation of COVID - 19 ( i . e . January 8 , 2020 ) and 280 the day when the first case reported by the Hong Kong government . Mathematically , the 281 equation is shown as Eq . ( 1 ) : 282 E [ (cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:3) ; (cid:5) (cid:6) (cid:7) ] = (cid:1) (cid:10) (cid:2)t(cid:7)exp (cid:2) (cid:16) 0 + (cid:16) 1 (cid:20)(cid:21)(cid:22)(cid:3)(cid:23)(cid:21)(cid:24) (cid:25) + (cid:16) 2 (cid:27)(cid:28)(cid:25)(cid:24)(cid:3) (cid:25) (cid:7) ( 1 ) 283 284 where t denotes the time to the first confirmed cases reported , λ 0 ( t ) is the baseline hazard 285 function , E [ λ ( t ; X i ) ] is the expected hazards function at time t , X i = { Control i , Built i } is the 286 covariate for the i - th TPU , Control i , and Built i are the two vectors that document the control 287 variables and built environment - related variables in the i - th TPU , β j ( j = 0 , 1 , 2 ) are the 288 coefficients that need to be estimated . 289 290 3 . 3 The association of the built environment and the duration of suffering the COVID - 19 291 To explore the association analysis regarding the built environment and the duration of 292 suffering the risk of COVID - 19 , the empirical analysis will be conducted in two sections . 293 Section 3 . 3 . 1 is to use the OLS to consider the impact of built environment attributes on the 294 duration of COVID - 19 for two phases , where the duration for each phase is termed as the 295 time period between the first confirmed case and the last confirmed case . In section 3 . 3 . 2 , we 296 further investigate the association of COVID - 19 confirmed cases and the built environment . 297 The models are detailed in the following subsections in which Section 3 . 3 . 1 discusses the 298 ordinary least squares ( OLS ) estimates , while Section 3 . 3 . 2 portrays the count data analysis . 299 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 8 300 3 . 3 . 1 . Duration model for risk analysis ( OLS analysis ) 301 As inspired by the recent study ( Tian et al . , 2020 ) , the impact of the built environment on the 302 duration of the COVID - 19 can be modelled as the linear function of a series of the built 303 environment attributes . The mathematical presentation is shown as follows 304 (cid:29) [ (cid:24)(cid:22)(cid:2)(cid:31) ! " (cid:6) (cid:7) ] = # (cid:10) + # $ (cid:20)(cid:21)(cid:22)(cid:3)(cid:23)(cid:21)(cid:24) (cid:6) + # % (cid:27)(cid:28)(cid:25)(cid:24)(cid:3) (cid:6) ( 2 ) 305 where E [ ln ( Days i ) ] is the expected duration of COVID - 19 in i - th TPU , Control i , and Built i , 306 are the same variables as indicated in Section 3 . 2 . 307 308 3 . 3 . 2 Count data models 309 To carry out the analysis as regards the association between the reported confirmed cases and 310 the built environment , we will utilize the count data models . Three main types of count data 311 models , namely Poisson regression , negative binomial regression , and zero - inflated models 312 are widely considered in the existing literature . 313 314 3 . 3 . 2 . 1 Poisson Regression 315 Recall that the Poisson probability function is with the mathematical form : 316 & (cid:2) ! , (cid:1)(cid:7) = ( ) * + , - ! , for y = 0 , 1 , 2 , … ( 3 ) 317 with E [ y ] = Var ( y ) = λ , where λ serves as both the mean and variance of the Poisson model . 318 The investigation of association analysis is to relate the parameter λ to the covariates X such 319 that X = { Control , Built } . Mathematically , the function form is shown as follows : 320 E [ ln ( λ i ) ] = γ 0 + γ 1 Control i + γ 2 Built i , for i = 1 , 2 , 3 , … . ( 4 ) 321 where Control i , and Built i share the same meaning of section 3 . 2 , γ j ( j = 0 , 1 , 2 ) are the 322 coefficients to be estimated . 323 324 3 . 3 . 2 . 2 Negative Binomial Regression 325 The probability function of the negative binomial distribution is of the mathematical form : 326 & (cid:2) ! , (cid:1) , (cid:7) = / 0 - 1 2 3 4 / 0 - 1 2 3 4 / 0 2 3 4 (cid:2) $ $ 15 + (cid:7) 2 3 (cid:2)1 − $ $ 15 + (cid:7) - , for y = 0 , 1 , 2 , … ( 5 ) 327 The mean and variance of random variable y are E ( y ) = λ and Var ( y ) = λ + αλ 2 , respectively . 328 The link of association to the built environment is similar to the Poisson regression above , 329 which is 330 E [ ln ( λ i ) ] = θ 0 + θ 1 Control i + θ 2 Built i , for i = 1 , 2 , 3 , … . ( 6 ) 331 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 9 where the θ j ( j = 0 , 1 , 2 ) are the coefficients that need to be estimated , the other terms remain 332 the same as equation ( 4 ) . The usage of θ j is because the estimation of equation ( 6 ) relates to 333 the negative binomial model rather than the equation ( 4 ) that relates to the Poisson model . 334 335 3 . 3 . 2 . 3 Zero - inflated models 336 On seeing the distribution of COVID - 19 confirmed cases in Hong Kong , not all the TPUs are 337 reported to have cases . As such , the i - th TPU consists of “zero” confirmed cases that may not 338 be well handled by the aforementioned models ( i . e . Poisson regression and negative binomial 339 regression ) . To tackle this issue , the mixture model that incorporates the zeros and the above 340 count data model is considered for the following analysis . Without losing generality , the 341 mathematical equation is shown as follows 342 7(cid:2) ! (cid:6) | (cid:1)(cid:7) = 9 : + (cid:2)1 − : (cid:7) & (cid:2) ! (cid:6) = 0(cid:7) , y < = 0 , = (cid:21) > (cid:25)(cid:3) " ? @ (cid:3)(cid:25)(cid:21)(cid:22) (cid:2)1 − : (cid:7) & (cid:2) ! (cid:6) (cid:7) , y < = 1 , 2 , . . . . , B(cid:3) (cid:22)C (cid:23)C @ (cid:21)(cid:28)(cid:22)(cid:3) D(cid:21)C ? (cid:24) ( 7 ) 343 where p ( y i ) is the count data distribution in the i - th TPU as listed above and : stands for the 344 uncertainty parameter . 345 346 4 . Results and Discussion 347 The statistical results are summarized in Tables 2 – 11 . Tables 2 – 6 report the results of Phase 348 1 ( from January 8 to June 15 ) , and Tables 7 – 11 display the results of Phase 2 ( from June 16 349 to August 30 ) . All the statistical results were performed using Stata / MP 16 . 350 351 4 . 1 Results of Phase 1 352 4 . 1 . 1 Survival analysis in phase 1 ( from Jan . 8 to Jun . 15 ) 353 As suggested by Figure . 4 , we first consider the association between the built environment 354 and the risk of infecting COVID - 19 . The results of the Cox model are shown in Table 2 . Five 355 variables are detected to be significant . They are Population , HSize , WorkDT , N _ Clinic , and 356 D _ Restaurant . The magnitude of the Population is slightly greater than one ( 1 . 0001 , Table 2 ) , 357 indicating that the TPU with a high population would bear a high risk of COVID - 19 . 358 Similarly , the significant value of the hazard ratio of HSize ( 2 . 2878 , Table 2 ) indicates that 359 more interaction between family members provided that household size is large , the higher 360 risk of COVID - 19 infection . Surprisingly , the hazard ratio of WorkDT ( 0 . 9998 , Table 2 ) is 361 found to be significant with a magnitude is less than one . The significance of N _ Clinic 362 ( 1 . 0057 , Table 2 ) may exhibit that people in the TPU with more clinics have a high risk of 363 being infected by COVID - 19 . Another significant built environment variable D _ Restaurant is 364 found to have a hazard ratio with a scale slightly larger than one ( 1 . 0007 , Table 2 ) . 365 < insert Table 2 > 366 < insert Table 3 > 367 368 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 10 The validity of the statistical results in Table 2 should not violate the Cox proportion hazard 369 assumption . In this regard , we would like to consider the Schoenfeld Residuals tests for the 370 Cox model . The residual plots of the significant variables N _ Clinic and D _ Restaurant are 371 shown in Figure B . 1 and B . 2 ( See Appendice , Section B ) , respectively . It is easy to observe 372 that both of these two graphs have zero slopes , indicating that they do not violate the 373 assumption of the Cox model . Moreover , the test results for the proportional hazard 374 assumption for the rest of the variables are summarized in Table 3 . None of them are detected 375 to be significant , suggesting that we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the data meets the 376 proportional hazard assumption . 377 378 4 . 1 . 2 Ordinary least squares ( OLS ) analysis in phase 1 ( from Jan . 8 to Jun . 15 ) 379 We employ OLS to consider the association between the built environment and the duration 380 of suffering the COVID - 19 . The results are demonstrated in Table 4 , where only three 381 variables are found to be significant , namely Population , HSize , and N _ Restaurant . The TPU 382 with high population density and large household size would lead to a longer period of 383 COVID - 19 . If a TPU has more restaurants , people have a long period to bear the risk of the 384 spread of COVID - 19 . During the period of Phase 1 , the Hong Kong government issued the 385 social distancing measure on March 29 , which states that group gatherings with more than 4 386 people are prohibited and restaurants must ensure there is a distance of at least 1 . 5 meters 387 between tables ( HKSAR , 2020b ; Elwira , 2020 ) . The social distancing measure to some extent 388 limited the scale of group gathering rather than entirely restricting the group gathering . In 389 Hong Kong , restaurants are served as an important built environment to enable people to 390 have more social interactions and compensate tiny living space to cook food . People in Hong 391 Kong heavily rely on a different kind of restaurant in their daily life . As such , the Hong Kong 392 government has to make a difficult decision to restrict the group gathering size instead of 393 forcing all the restaurants to shut down for some days or weeks . In this regard , more 394 restaurants in the TPU may give rise to more exposure of COVID - 19 to the residents . 395 396 < insert Table 4 > 397 398 We intend to check the heteroscedasticity ( see Appendices , section A1 ) of the OLS presented 399 in Table 4 . The statistics of the Breusch - Pagan test is 0 . 07 ( p - value = 0 . 794 , Table 4 ) , which 400 is in line with the residuals - versus - fitted plot ( Figure B . 3 , in Appendices ) . It suggests that 401 we do not find evidence of heteroscedasticity . Also , we need to check whether the residuals 402 of OLS in Table 4 is normal . The insignificant result of the Jarque - Bera test ( 4 . 58 , with p - 403 value = 0 . 101 , Table 4 ) , which echoes with the Q - Q plot ( Figure B . 4 , in Appendices ) that we 404 cannot reject the null hypothesis of the Jarque - Bera test ( the residuals follow a normal 405 distribution ) . 406 407 4 . 1 . 3 Count data analysis in phase 1 ( from Jan . 8 to Jun . 15 ) 408 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 11 Using OLS is not enough to unveil the association between the built environment and 409 duration of suffering the COVID - 19 as the analysis of OLS does not consider the size of 410 confirmed cases in TPU . For such purpose , we consider the association between the built 411 environment and the risk of COVID - 19 in terms of the reported cases . As suggested in 412 Section 3 , there is more than one choice to model the reported COVID - 19 cases . Before we 413 explain the model results , it is necessary to discuss the legitimacy of picking up the negative 414 model as a reasonable choice for this study . On seeing the patterns of COVID - 19 confirmed 415 cases in Figure 2a and Figure 2b , it is easy to identify that some TPUs have no confirmed 416 case , which motives us to model the data with zero - inflated Poisson regression and zero - 417 inflated negative binomial regression . 418 419 < insert Figure 5 > 420 < insert Table 5 > 421 422 As such , we conduct four statistical tests for the model selection , where the results are 423 displayed in Table 5 . Considering that there are two different dependent variables in Phase 1 424 ( Table 5 ) , therefore eight scenarios in total need to be considered . It is straightforward to see 425 that all test - statistics of LR test 1 ( Poisson vs . Negative Binomial ) and LR test 2 ( ZIP vs . 426 ZNIB ) are significant . The significance of the statistics of LR test 1 implies that , on 427 comparing the Poisson regression and the negative binomial model , the latter one is 428 preferable for CaseFP and Δ CasesFP . Similarly , the significant test statistics of LR test 2 429 demonstrates that the zero - inflated negative binomial model is preferable to that of zero - 430 inflated Poisson regression . As none of the statistics of Vuong Test 2 is significant , 431 illustrating that the negative binomial regression is more reasonable than the zero - inflated 432 negative binomial regression for all scenarios . By incorporating the results of LR test 1 and 433 LR test 2 , the negative binomial regression outperforms the Poisson regression , and the ZINB 434 is better fitted than ZIP . In other words , the results of Vuong Test 1 would not affect the final 435 result of model selections ( Figure 5 ) . To warp up , the negative binomial model outperforms 436 the other three models ( see Figure 5 ) , which is reasonable and appropriate for CaseFP and 437 Δ CasesFP . The following analysis will be carried out based on the negative binomial 438 regression analysis . 439 440 Table 6 reports the association of the built environment and the COVID - 19 confirmed cases 441 from late January to mid - June in 2020 . The incidence rate ratio ( IRR ) is used to present the 442 model results in the following context as the IRR is a relative difference measure utilized to 443 compare the incidence rates of events occurring at a given point of time in epidemiology 444 ( Ray et al . , 2002 ; Calle et al . , 2003 ) . The magnitude of significant IRR greater than 1 in the 445 negative binomial regression model indicates the greater or higher the variables are , the more 446 likely they are to increase the infected COVID - 19 cases ( or the spread of COVID - 19 ) , 447 otherwise , it implies that they are less likely to increase COVID - 19 infected cases . 448 449 < insert Table 6 > 450 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 12 451 In the beginning , we consider the total COVID - 19 confirmed cases in Phase 1 ( Model 3 , 452 Table 6 ) . The model results show that six variables are significant ( Model 3 , Table 6 ) . They 453 are Age65 _ 14 , Population , HSize , WorkDT , N _ Restaurant , and D _ PublicMarket . 454 Specifically , the coverage of age 65 or above in TPU between 14 % and 20 % have a relatively 455 high risk of COVID - 19 by 49 . 15 % than other TPU areas where the percentage of age 65 or 456 above is between 7 % and 14 % . A TPU with high population density is found to be slightly 457 high exposure to COVID - 19 ( 1 . 0003 , Model 3 of Table 6 ) . Besides the population , we also 458 found that one more family member in the household likely increases the risk of infection of 459 COVID - 19 by 106 . 52 % ( 2 . 0652 , Table 6 ) . A household of large size implies more 460 interactions between the family members such that the virus of COVID - 19 is more likely to 461 spread among family members . Surprisingly , the IRR of WorkDT is determined to be smaller 462 than one ( 0 . 9999 , Table 6 ) . A possible explanation is that a large number of companies 463 shifted the working style from “work at the office” to “work from home” . Employees keep 464 themselves stand - by in front of the smart devices’ screen for the workdays , equivalently to be 465 isolated at home passively . N _ Restaurant and D _ PublicMarket are the two built environment 466 variables that are found to be significant . It outlines that purchasing fresh food in public 467 markets and having meals in the restaurants are the two necessities and basic needs of Hong 468 Kongers such that they bear a high risk of being infected COVID - 19 when visiting these two 469 built environments . 470 471 Considering that the Hong Kong government issued the social distancing measure on March 472 29 , we expect to explore the association between the built environment and the changes of 473 confirmed cases , which is comparing the cases before and after the social distancing 474 measures in Phase 1 . We change the dependent variable as Δ CasesFP , which is the difference 475 of reported confirmed cases after and before the social distancing measure . The results are 476 reported in Model 4 ( Table 6 ) , which are similar to that of Model 3 . Though social distancing 477 measure was in force from late March , the restaurants and public markets are founded to be 478 the two built environments that influence the transmission of COVID - 19 . 479 480 4 . 2 Results of Phase 2 ( from Jun . 16 to Aug . 30 ) 481 The statistical results of Phase 2 are shown in Table 7 - 11 . Table 7 reports the survival 482 analysis of the Cox regression of Phase 2 , which documents what built environment given the 483 social distancing measure was relaxed , would induce the new wave of COVID - 19 . Four built 484 environment variables , that is the number of clinics ( N _ Clinic ) , the number of public markets 485 ( N _ PublicMarket ) , the distance to the nearest public markets ( D _ PublicMarket ) , and the 486 distance to the nearest entrances of the MTR ( D _ MTRE ) . On checking the residual plots of 487 these four variables ( Figure B . 5 - B . 8 in Appendices ) , the slops are all zero . The results do not 488 violate the assumption of the Cox model , which is in line with the Schoenfeld Residuals tests 489 displayed in Table 8 . 490 491 < insert Table 7 > 492 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 13 < insert Table 8 > 493 494 We then consider the association between the built environment and the duration of suffering 495 the COVID - 19 . We consider the association between the built environment and the duration 496 of suffering the COVID - 19 . Distinguished to the results presented in Phase 1 ( Table 4 , and 497 Figure B . 3 ) , we have observed the problems of heteroscedasticity ( Table 9a , and Figure B . 9 498 in Appendices ) and not following normal distribution ( Table 9a , and Figure B . 10 in 499 Appendices ) , where the Breusch - Pagan test and Jarque - Bera statistics are found to be 500 significant with a coefficient of 28 . 28 ( p - value = 0 . 000 , Table 9a ) and 38 . 41 ( p - value = 0 . 000 , 501 Table 9a ) , respectively . To tackle this issue , estimation is a remedy by using the robust 502 standard error ( Table 9b ) . On comparting to the result in Phase 1 , two built environment 503 variables are found to be significant . They are N _ Restaurant and D _ PublicMarket . Relaxing 504 social distancing measures provides a signal for all the residents to resume normal social 505 interaction , which could be well explained why restaurants and public markets may induce a 506 long time suffering from COVID - 19 in Phase 2 . 507 < insert Table 9a - 9b > 508 < insert Table 10 > 509 < insert Table 11 > 510 511 We further investigate the association between the built environment and COVID - 19 512 confirmed cases in Phase 2 . Like what has been shown in the previous section , a model 513 selection should be made before addressing the model results . By following the same strategy 514 in section 4 . 2 . 3 , the results shown in Table 10 delineate that negative binomial regression is 515 the legitimacy for the count data analysis in Phase 2 . The estimations of negative binomial 516 models are summarized in Table 11 . Only one built environment variable ( i . e . N _ Restaurant ) 517 is significant with IRR greater than one . More restaurants in the TPU provide convenience 518 for social interaction , and however , it is also the risk area that virus can be spread among 519 people through resuming normal social interaction . It also implies that the Hong Kong 520 government underestimated the risk of the COVID - 19 and relaxed social distancing measures 521 with undue haste . 522 523 5 . Conclusions 524 The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) has soon become a very high concern 525 to the public as it led to the infection , death of thousands of people worldwide at a fast speed . 526 The existing literature as regards COVID - 19 are clustered on studying the infection rate , and 527 which NPI would effectively decrease the infection rate . However , the relationship between 528 the built environment and the spread of COVID - 19 has not been well addressed in the 529 literature . To fill this knowledge gap , this paper is a pioneering work to study two research 530 questions : ( 1 ) What are the association of the built environment with the risk of being 531 infected by the COVID - 19 ? ( 2 ) What are the association of the built environment with the 532 duration of suffering from COVID - 19 ? These two research questions align with our 533 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 14 proposition that the heterogeneous spread of COVID - 19 is based on the characteristics of the 534 built environment . 535 536 Using the census statistics on TPU level in 2016 , a large sample of built environment data 537 and confirmed cases of COVID - 19 from the Hong Kong government , the analysis is 538 conducted based on two time period , that is Phase 1 ( from January 8 to June 15 ) ( when the 539 social distancing was tight ) and Phase 2 ( between June 16 and August 30 ) ( after the social 540 distancing was slightly relaxed ) . In each phase , we have considered the association between 541 the built environment and the risk of being infected by COVID - 19 , then we have carried out 542 the analysis about the association between the built environment and duration of suffering the 543 COVID - 19 , last but not least , the association between the built environment and reported 544 COVID - 19 confirmed cases have been measured and quantified . 545 546 The statistics of the survival model ( i . e . Cox model ) herein shed light on what built 547 environments induce the prevalence of COVID - 19 confirmed cases . In Phase 1 , we found 548 that the clinics and restaurants are the two built environments that are more likely to 549 influence the prevalence of COVID - 19 . In Phase 2 , we discovered that MTR , public market , 550 and the clinics are the built environments that influence the prevalence of COVID - 19 . The 551 results of OLS models disclose what built environments induce a long time suffering from the 552 COVID - 19 . In Phase 1 , the areas of TPUs with more restaurants are found to be positively 553 associated with the period of the prevalence of COVID - 19 . In Phase 2 , we found that 554 restaurants and public markets are the two key built environments induce long time 555 occurrence of the COVID - 19 . The statistical results of the negative binomial models report 556 the association between the built environment and the severity of the COVID - 19 . In Phase 1 , 557 restaurant and public markets are the two built environments that influence the number of 558 COVID - 19 confirmed cases . In Phase 2 , we found that the number of restaurants is positively 559 related to the number of COVID - 19 reported cases . To recap , public markets and restaurants 560 are the two built environments that influence the transmission of the COVID - 19 in both 561 phases . It is suggested that the government should not be too optimistic to relax the social 562 distancing measure even the COVID - 19 confirmed cases decline to be single - digit level . 563 Without seeing the signals of the COVID - 19 die out , the social distancing measure should 564 remain in force to avoid the large - scale outbreak . 565 566 The limitation of this research lies in the following dimensions , which could be potentially 567 fruitful directions for future research . In the first place , this study employs survival analysis 568 ( i . e . Cox model ) , ordinary least square method , and count data analysis to study the link 569 between the built environment and the spread of COVID - 19 . These methods focus on cross - 570 sectional analysis only . Future studies should consider longitude analysis , which incorporates 571 both time and location information . In the second place , this study is carried out based on the 572 aggregate level of census data , the future study should be conducted on the micro - scale ( i . e . 573 individual data ) . In the third place , the analysis covered in this study follows the indirect 574 manner , which investigates the impacts of static indicators ( e . g . number of the built 575 environment facilities and distance to the built environment facilities ) on the spread of 576 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 15 COVID - 19 . However , people’s social behaviour such as whether people strictly follow the 577 social distancing measure with no more than 4 people in group gathering in restaurants 578 should be considered in future studies . Last but not least , the study only covers one city , 579 future research should also consider the built environment and the spread of the COVID - 19 at 580 the regional level or cross - country level . 581 582 Appendices 583 Section A . 584 Utilization of the OLS should follow two assumptions ( Gujarati , 2009 ; Greene , 2018 ) : ( 1 ) the 585 residual ( or error term ) of the OLS should not be heteroscedasticity ( or called unequal scatter ) ; 586 ( 2 ) the residual ( or error term ) of the OLS should follow the normal distribution . The 587 technical procedures of checking these two assumptions are listed in section A1 and A2 588 below . 589 590 A1 . Checking the assumption of heteroscedasticity of the OLS ( Phase 1 ) 591 To check the assumption of heteroscedasticity of the OLS , we first use the data visualization 592 method to capture the patterns , then follow with some solid statistical tests . In specific , the 593 visualization method called residual - versus - fitted plot is commonly used in the existing 594 studies ( Gujarati , 2009 ; Greene , 2018 ) . The term residual is equivalent to error term , which in 595 mathematical form can be produced by doing some simple algebra of equation ( 2 ) in section 596 3 . 3 . 1 : residual = ln ( Days i ) – E [ ln ( Days i ) ] or residual = ln ( Days i ) – α 0 – α 1 Control i – α 2 Built i . 597 The term fitted means the fitted value is based on the estimated coefficient α k ( k = 0 , 1 , 2 ) . 598 The mathematical form of the fitted value (cid:29) [ (cid:24)(cid:22)(cid:2)(cid:31) ! " E (cid:7) ] F is : (cid:29) [ (cid:24)(cid:22)(cid:2)(cid:31) ! " E (cid:7) ] F = # (cid:10) G + # $ G(cid:20)(cid:21)(cid:22)(cid:3)(cid:23)(cid:21)(cid:24) (cid:6) + 599 # % G(cid:27)(cid:28)(cid:25)(cid:24)(cid:3) (cid:6) , where (cid:29) [ (cid:24)(cid:22)(cid:2)(cid:31) ! " E (cid:7) ] F , # (cid:10) G , # $ G and # % G are the estimated value . The residual - versus - fitted 600 plot of phase 1 is shown in Figure B . 3 , we can easily observe that some points are clustered , 601 while some other not . The pattern shown in Figure B . 3 may not provide a clear idea of 602 whether the residuals are equal scatter . Therefore , we turn to perform the Breusch - Pagan test . 603 The null hypothesis of the Breusch - Pagan test is that the constant variance ( or equal scatter ) 604 of the error term is preferable ( Gujarati , 2009 ) . The Breusch - Pagan test in Table 4 shows that 605 the statistics are 0 . 07 , which is found to be not significant ( p - value = 0 . 794 , Table 4 ) . The 606 Breusch - Pagan test results suggest that we do not find evidence of heteroscedasticity . In other 607 words , the OLS results satisfy the first assumption . 608 609 A2 . Checking the assumption of the residual ( or error term ) of the OLS follows the normal 610 distribution ( Phase 1 ) 611 As for checking the second assumption , we again employ the scatter plot to identify the 612 pattern , then perform the statistical test . As indicated by Gujarati ( 2009 ) and Greene ( 2018 ) , 613 the visualization method to check whether the residuals or error terms of the OLS follow 614 normal distribution can rely on a quantile - quantile plot ( i . e . Q - Q plot ) . The Q - Q plot is a 615 graphical method for comparing two probability distributions by plotting their quantiles 616 against each other . In this paper , we first calculate the residuals based on equation ( 2 ) in 617 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 16 section 3 . 3 . 1 , which follows the same procedure in checking the heteroscedasticity above 618 ( Appendix A1 ) . Then we used the calculated residuals to estimate the quantiles ( or 619 cumulative distribution ) . On knowing the cumulative distribution , we can easily generate the 620 inversed quantile of the standard normal distribution in a theoretical manner . Mathematically , 621 these procedures can be presented as the following two equations : 622 N - 1 ( probability of residuals ) = quantile of residuals ( * ) 623 N - 1 ( probability of standard normal distribution ) = quantile of a standard normal distribution 624 or called inversed normal ( * * ) 625 Where N - 1 ( ● ) stands for the inverse function of standard cumulative normal distribution . If 626 the residuals follow the standard normal distribution , then the plot of the value of ( * ) and ( * * ) 627 should land on the straight - line y = x . On seeing the patterns of the Q - Q plot in Figure B . 4 , it 628 is not difficult to see that some points at two extremes are a little bit far away from the 629 straight - line y = x , while the rest of the dots are located closer to the straight - line y = x . The 630 pattern displayed in Figure B . 4 may suggest that the residuals follow the normal distribution , 631 we then consider the statistical test to validate what we observe . We employ the Jarque - Bera 632 test . The null hypothesis of the Jarque - Bera test is that the error term follows the normal 633 distribution . The statistics of the Jarque - Bera test in Table 4 is 4 . 58 ( p - value = 0 . 101 ) , which 634 is not significant . The Jarque - Bera test results echo with the Q - Q plot ( Figure B . 4 ) such that 635 we cannot reject the null hypothesis of the Jarque - Bera test ( the residuals follow a normal 636 distribution ) . 637 638 A3 . Checking two assumptions of the OLS ( phase 2 ) 639 The analysis of checking two assumptions of the OLS in phase 2 follows the same procedures 640 in Appendices A1 and A2 . We first test the heteroscedasticity assumption of the OLS 641 residuals . Then we check whether the residuals follow normal distribution . The patterns 642 displayed in Figure B . 9 is very similar to that of Figure B . 3 . But we cannot identify whether 643 the residuals are heteroscedasticity or not . We therefore need to conduct the Breusch - Pagan 644 test . The statistics are found to be significant with a coefficient of 28 . 28 ( p - value = 0 . 000 , 645 Table 9a ) , which is distinguished to that of phase 1 ( Table 4 ) . We also need to check whether 646 the residuals follow normal distribution . It is easy to see from Figure B . 10 that more points 647 are located further away from the fitted line , which maybe the signal that the residuals do not 648 follow normal distribution . The Jarque - Bera test exhibited in Table 9a is significant with 649 coefficient 38 . 41 ( p - value , Table 9a ) , which again is different from that of phase 1 . 650 651 Section B . 652 < insert Figure B . 1 > 653 < insert Figure B . 2 > 654 < insert Figure B . 3 > 655 < insert Figure B . 4 > 656 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 17 < insert Figure B . 5 > 657 < insert Figure B . 6 > 658 < insert Figure B . 7 > 659 < insert Figure B . 8 > 660 < insert Figure B . 9 > 661 < insert Figure B . 10 > 662 663 Acknowledgement 664 This study was supported by Research Grants of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University 665 ( Project Codes : 1 - YW3L ( P0000319 ) ) and the research grant from the Research Grants 666 Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region , China ( UGC / IDS16 / 17 ) 667 668 References 669 Ali , S .
