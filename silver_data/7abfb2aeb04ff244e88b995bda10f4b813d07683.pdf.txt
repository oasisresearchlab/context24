Methods Plant materials Except where indicated , the Colombia - 0 ( Col - 0 ) ecotype was used as the wild type . fkf1 ( ref . 2 ) , cca1 - 1lhy - R ( 48 ) 12 , cry1cry2 ( ref . 20 ) , phot1 - 5phot2 - 1 ( ref . 21 ) and phyA - 201 ( ref . 20 ) have been described . The fkf1 - 2 T - DNA insertion line ( 593 _ H05 ) was obtained from the SAIL collection 22 . The cab2 : : luc and ccr2 : : luc reporters and 35S : : CO ( ref . 23 ) were introduced into fkf1 alleles by crossing . To generate 35S : : FKF1 – TAP and 35S : : LKP2 – TAP , thecodingregionsof FKF1 cDNAand LKP2 cDNAwereclonedinto pRTL2 – TAP ( pRTL2 ( ref . 24 ) containingaTAP 25 fragment ) andthensubclonedintopBI221binaryvector 26 . To generate the FKF1 promoter driven FKF1 – TAP construct , we replaced the CaMV35S promoter in p35S : : FKF1 – TAP by 1 . 6kb of the FKF1 promoter plus the 5 0 untranslated region fragment .

Bioﬁlms are surface - attached microbial communities with characteristic architecture and phenotypic and biochemical properties distinct from their free - swimming , planktonic counterparts 1 . One of the best - known of these bioﬁlm - speciﬁc properties is the development of antibiotic resistance that can be up to 1 , 000 - fold greater than planktonic cells 2 . We report a genetic determinant of this high - level resistance in the Gram - negative opportunistic pathogen , Pseudomonas aeruginosa . We have identiﬁed a mutant of P . aeruginosa that , while still capable of forming bioﬁlms with the characteristic P . aeruginosa archi - tecture , does not develop high - level bioﬁlm - speciﬁc resistance to three different classes of antibiotics . The locus identiﬁed in our screen , ndvB , is required for the synthesis of periplasmic glucans . Our discovery that these periplasmic glucans interact physically with tobramycin suggests that these glucose polymers may prevent antibiotics from reaching their sites of action by seques - letters to nature NATURE | VOL 426 | 20 NOVEMBER2003 | www . nature . com / nature 306 © 2003 Nature PublishingGroup tering these antimicrobial agents in the periplasm . Our results indicate that bioﬁlms themselves are not simply a diffusion barrier to these antibiotics , but rather that bacteria within these microbial communities employ distinct mechanisms to resist the action of antimicrobial agents . Surface - attached bacterial communities , or bioﬁlms , can become 10 – 1 , 000 times more resistant to the effects of antimicrobial agents than their planktonic counterparts 2 . This characteristic of bioﬁlms makes them extremely difﬁcult to control in medical and industrial settings 3 . We hypothesized that bioﬁlm resistance to antimicrobial agents is part of a regulated developmental process and thus would require an identiﬁable set of genetic determinants . Using a 96 - well microtitre plate - based assay for bioﬁlm - speciﬁc antibiotic resistance , a library of , 4 , 000 random P . aeruginosa PA14 transposon insertion mutants was screened for the inability to develop the characteristic increase in resistance of wild - type bio - ﬁlm - grown cells . A mutant was identiﬁed , designated 45E7 , that had decreased resistance to tobramycin ( Tb ) when grown in a bioﬁlm , but grew as well as the wild type in planktonic culture , formed a bioﬁlm indistinguishable from a bioﬁlm formed by the wild - type strain in the microtitre plate assay , and displayed a planktonic minimal bactericidal concentration ( MBC ) for Tb that was indis - tinguishable from the parent strain . To assess the generality of bioﬁlm antibiotic sensitivity of the mutant , the MBC of bioﬁlm - grown and planktonically grown wild - type and 45E7 strains was determined for gentamicin ( Gm ) , ciproﬂoxacin ( Cip ) , nalidixic acid ( Nal ) , chloramphenicol ( Cm ) and oﬂoxacin ( Oﬂ ) . For all of these antibiotics tested , there was no difference in the planktonic MBC between the wild type and the 45E7 mutant . The MBC of bioﬁlm - grown 45E7 was eightfold lower for Gm and Cip , twofold lower for Cm and Oﬂ , and unchanged for Nal when compared to the wild type ( Table 1 and see Supplemen - tary Information ) . Therefore , the 45E7 locus can account for some , but not all , of the bioﬁlm - mediated resistance observed for most antibiotics . We used three other assays of bioﬁlm antibiotic resistance to conﬁrm the antibiotic sensitivity phenotype observed in the micro - titre plate . The Tb - sensitivity phenotype in a ﬂow cell was demon - strated by treating a 24 - h - old , pre - formed bioﬁlm with Tb , then staining the Tb - treated bioﬁlm with the BacLight viability stain ( Fig . 1 ) . When viewed by phase - contrast microscopy ( Fig . 1a , left panels ) , no difference in bioﬁlm architecture was discernible between the wild type and the mutant ( see also Table 2 ) . The centre and right panels show that there were more live ( green , syto - 9 - stained ) than dead ( red , stained with propidium iodide ) cells in the wild - type bioﬁlm after treatment with Tb . Conversely , there were more dead cells than live ones in the 45E7 bioﬁlm . Quantiﬁcation of propidium iodide - dependent ﬂuorescence demonstrated 100 - fold greater ﬂuorescence intensity for the 45E7 mutant versus the wild type . When 72 - h - old bioﬁlms were treated with Tb , the 45E7 mutant bioﬁlm was only threefold more sensitive than the wild - type bioﬁlm ( see Supplementary Information ) , suggesting that the 45E7 locus plays a more important role in younger bioﬁlms . As a control , bioﬁlms were stained with BacLight before exposure to Tb ( Fig . 1b ) and most cells in both the wild - type and 45E7 bioﬁlms stained green , indicating that the 45E7 mutant does not have a general viability defect . We used a second , quantitative assay to document the 45E7 mutant phenotype . The colony bioﬁlm assay exploits the obser - vation that bacterial colonies develop some of the properties of bioﬁlms , including increased antibiotic resistance 4 , 5 ( Fig . 2 ) . 45E7 bioﬁlm cells remained as resistant to the effects of Tb as the wild type at the ﬁrst two time points assayed . However , at 48 h , while the wild - type bioﬁlm cell viability was only reduced by two orders of magnitude , the viable cells detected for the 45E7 mutant decreased by at least ﬁve orders of magnitude . There was no difference in the viability of the strains in the absence of antibiotics over this time course . Furthermore , we found that there was no difference in the ability of Tb to diffuse through the colony bioﬁlms formed by either of these strains ( data not shown ) . The rotating disk assay 6 was employed as another quantitative method to assess the phenotype of the 45E7 mutant . After forming on coupons , wild - type and mutant bioﬁlms were exposed to varying concentrations of Tb . A lower concentration of Tb was necessary to kill the cells of the mutant bioﬁlm compared to the wild - type bioﬁlm ( see Supplementary Information ) . These results , taken together with the data presented above , indicate conclusively that the 45E7 mutant , when growing in a bioﬁlm , is less resistant than the wild type to the antimicrobial effects of Tb . Next , we used ﬂow cells to analyse the architecture of the wild - type and mutant strains . Both strains formed heterogeneous macrocolonies and ﬂuid - ﬁlled channels that are characteristic of P . aeruginosa bioﬁlms 7 ( Fig . 1 ) . To quantitate the architecture of bioﬁlms formed by these strains , we used the COMSTAT software program 7 . COMSTAT analysis showed that there is no discernible difference between these strains for a number of architectural parameters at 24h ( Table 2 ) .

The ndvB gene codes for a glucosyltransferase that is required for the synthesis of cyclic - b - ( 1 , 3 ) - glucans 9 . Located in the periplasm and also secreted into the extracellular media , cyclic glucans are circular polymers of glucose that have been shown to play a role in adaptation to low osmotic media , ﬂagella - mediated motility and plant – microbe interactions 10 . Furthermore , a plank - tonically grown B . japonicum strain carrying an ndvB mutation is more sensitive to chloramphenicol than the parent strain 11 . To conﬁrm that mutation in the ndvB gene was causative for the observed phenotypes , we disrupted the gene in P . aeruginosa strains PA14 , PAO1 and PAK , and tested the antibiotic sensitivity of these mutants in the 96 - well microtitre plate assay . In all cases , the mutant was more sensitive than the wild - type strain when growing in a bioﬁlm , but no differences were observed between the strains grown planktonically ( see Supplementary Information ) . However , in the two additional strains , the inﬂuence of ndvB was not as great as for PA14 . Most notably , only a twofold difference was observed for PA01 . Although the data support an involvement for ndvB in bioﬁlm antibiotic resistance , it may be that some strains of Pseudo - monas have compensatory mechanisms for ndvB mutations . To determine whether a difference in periplasmic glucan pro - duction existed between the wild type and the ndvB mutant , we examined ethanol - extracted periplasmic material 9 puriﬁed from both strains by gel ﬁltration over a Sephadex G - 75 column ( detected using the anthrone - sulphuric acid method 12 ) . The most striking difference between wild - type and mutant chromatograms was observed between fractions 60 and 68 ( Fig . 3a ) . Whereas a signiﬁ - cant amount of anthrone - positive material was present in these fractions in the wild type , the equivalent fractions from the ndvB mutant contained relatively little anthrone - positive material . Because periplasmic cyclic glucan material from Sinorhizobium meliloti eluted from the same column in the same area ( the main peak at fraction 62 ; data not shown ) , we reasoned that the missing material from the mutant 45E7 might be periplasmic glucans . Monosaccharide composition analyses using Dionex high - perform - ance anion exchange chromatography coupled with pulsed ampero - metric detection ( HPAEC - PAD ) 13 indicated that the material present in fractions 60 – 68 from the wild type , and missing from the mutant , was composed exclusively of glucose ( see Supplemen - tary Information ) . Taken together , our genetic and carbohydrate analyses strongly suggest that the ndvB mutant is deﬁcient in production of periplasmic glucans . On the basis of the current understanding of the roles of periplasmic glucans in B . japonicum , S . meliloti and Agrobacterium tumefaciens , we envisioned several possible models to account for the role of these molecules in development of resistance in bioﬁlm populations . Unlike the effects of ndvB mutations in Rhizobac - teria 10 , the P . aeruginosa ndvB mutant had no apparent defects in adaptation to low osmotic stress conditions or ﬂagella - mediated motility . From the observation that related cyclic sugar polymers called cyclodextrins could sequester “guest molecules” in a non - covalent fashion 14 , we considered the possibility that one role of periplasmic glucans may be to sequester antimicrobial agents in bioﬁlm - grown cells 10 . If periplasmic glucans were indeed sequester - ing Tb , we predicted that these molecules should interact in vitro . To test this , we examined interactions of crude and puriﬁed glucans with Tb by hydrophobic interaction ( HI ) chromatography . Tb alone was loaded onto a HI interaction resin ( C18 ) column , and was detected in the column ﬂow - through and ﬁrst water wash of the Figure 2 Colony bioﬁlm assay for antibiotic sensitivity . 48 - h - old colonies of the wild - type ( ﬁlled symbols ) and the 45E7 mutant ( open symbols ) were transferred to solid medium without ( triangles ) or with 10 m gml 2 1 Tb ( squares ) . The viability of the wild type decreased 100 - fold with Tb treatment relative to the untreated control , while the 45E7 mutant decreased 10 5 - fold . In the absence of antibiotic , there was no difference in viability between the two strains .

In contrast , when a crude periplasmic carbohydrate extract from the wild - type strain was pre - loaded onto the column , some of the Tb was retained on the column and eluted with 25 % acetonitrile ( Fig . 3b , left ) . Conversely , when crude extract from the ndvB mutant strain was pre - loaded onto the column , very little Tb was retained on the column ( see Supplementary Information ) . To determine which components of the crude extract were responsible for the Tb retention on the C18 column , we performed the same experiment as above except the C - 18 column was pre - loaded with partially pure material from fractions 60 – 68 from G - 75 columns ( Fig . 3c ) . Tb was retained on the column that was pre - loaded with material from the wild - type extract and eluted from the column with 25 % acetonitrile . In contrast , no Tb activity was present in the 25 % acetonitrile fraction from the column that was pre - loaded with the corresponding fractions isolated from the P . aeruginosa ndvB mutant . These data support the hypothesis that periplasmic glucans may sequester antibiotics , thereby slowing or stopping the diffusion of these molecules to their site of action . On the basis of the bioﬁlm - speciﬁc role of ndvB in resistance , we predicted that this gene is expressed only in bioﬁlm - grown cells . RNA was prepared from bioﬁlm - grown and planktonically grown cells from a continuous culture system 15 . Semi - quantitative RT – PCR using primers to ndvB revealed that there was preferential expression of ndvB in the bioﬁlm mode of growth ( Fig . 4 ) . We propose a mechanism for bioﬁlm - speciﬁc resistance wherein periplasmic glucans bind to and sequester antibiotics . This extra - cytoplasmic mode of antibiotic sequestration would be expected to interfere with the passage of antibiotics through the periplasmic space to their site of action in the cytoplasm . High levels of the antibiotic needed to eliminate bioﬁlm bacteria may be required to overwhelm the ability of the glucans to bind antimicrobial agents effectively . Alternatively , periplasmic glucans may not entirely account mechanistically for all of the antibiotic resistance of bioﬁlm cells but may contribute to it by slowing the diffusion of antibiotics into the cell , thereby allowing the bacteria additional time to adapt to the antibiotic insult , an idea consistent with the model proposed previously 15 . We also showed that the P . aeruginosa ndvB mutant had increased bioﬁlm - sensitivity to ﬁve antibiotics from three different structural families . This observation is consistent with previous reports that cyclic glucans can bind a range of chemically distinct molecules 10 and the reported ability of bioﬁlms to develop broad resistance to antimicrobial agents 16 . It may now be possible to identify new strategies to block the development of bioﬁlm resistance . For example , a co - therapeutic approach where traditional antibiotics are combined with a drug that interferes with bioﬁlm - speciﬁc resistance may render bioﬁlms more susceptible to treatment .

To isolate strains defective in bioﬁlm antibiotic resistance , individual transposon mutants were inoculated from cultures grown overnight in LB into sterile 96 - well microtitre plates containing minimal arginine medium . Bioﬁlms were allowed to form for 24h , after which time the medium was replaced with fresh minimal arginine medium supplemented with 50 m gml 2 1 Tb ( Research Products International Corporation ) . After 24h of exposure to Tb , bioﬁlmswereallowedtorecoverinfreshmedialackingTbforanadditional24h ; their viability was then assessed by plating a small volume of each culture on LB plates . The minimal bactericidal concentration for bioﬁlm - grown cells ( MBC - B ) was determined by exposing 24 - h - old bioﬁlms to various concentrations of antibiotic for 24h , followed by a 24h recovery period and plating for viability . The MBC of planktonic bacteria ( MBC - P ) was determined byadding antibiotic to bacteria at the time of inoculation , incubating for 24h , followedbyplatingforviability .

Transposon silencing in the Caenorhabditis elegans germ line by natural RNAi Titia Sijen & Ronald H . A .

Transposable elements are stretches of DNA that can move and multiply within the genome of an organism . The Caenorhabditis elegans genome contains multiple Tc 1 transposons that jump in somatic cells , but are silenced in the germ line 1 – 3 . Many mutants that have lost this silencing have also lost the ability to execute RNA interference ( RNAi ) 2 , 3 , a process whereby genes are sup - pressed by exposure to homologous double - stranded RNA ( dsRNA ) . Here we show how RNAi causes transposon silencing in the nematode germ line . We ﬁnd evidence for transposon - derived dsRNAs , in particular to the terminal inverted repeats , and show that these RNAs may derive from read - through tran - scription of entire transposable elements . Small interfering RNAs of Tc 1 were detected . When a germline - expressed reporter gene is fused to a stretch of Tc 1 sequence , this transgene is silenced in a manner dependent on functional mutator genes ( mut - 7 , mut - 16 and pk732 ) . These results indicate that RNAi surveillance is triggered by fortuitous read - through transcription of dispersed Tc 1 copies , which can form dsRNA as a result of ‘snap - back’ of the terminal inverted repeats . RNAi mediated by this dsRNA silences transposase gene expression . Genome - sequencing projects have shown that genomes contain large numbers of transposable elements ; for example , 45 % of the human genome consists of remnants of transposon sequences , whereas 2 % encodes protein . Transposon sequences comprise 12 % of the C . elegans genome ; of the several DNA transposons , Tc 1 is the most abundant element , with 31 intact copies 4 . Transpo - sition ( through a cut - and - paste mechanism ) is mediated by a Tc 1 - encoded transposase that speciﬁcally recognizes the Tc 1 termi - nal inverted repeats ( TIRs ) 5 . Transposition only occurs in somatic cells and not in the germ line 1 . The identiﬁcation of mutator mutants , which do show germline transposition , indicated that an active transposon - silencing process exists in the germ line .
