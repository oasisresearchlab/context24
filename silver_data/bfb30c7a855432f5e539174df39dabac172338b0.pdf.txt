Vines 1 From the Department of Microbiology , Molecular Genetics , and Immunology , The University of Kansas Medical Center , Kansas City , Kansas 66160 CCR7 binds to its cognate ligand , CCL21 , to mediate the migration of circulating naive T lymphocytes to the lymph nodes . T lymphocytes can bind to fibronectin , a constituent of lymph nodes , via their (cid:2) 1 integrins , which is a primary mecha - nism of T lymphocyte migration ; however , the signaling path - ways involved are unclear . We report that rapid ( within 2 min ) and transient phosphorylation of ERK1 / 2 is required for T cell migration on fibronectin in response to CCL21 . Conversely , prevention of ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation by inhibition of its kinase , MAPK / MEK , prevented T lymphocyte migration . Previ - ous studies have suggested that phospholipase C (cid:1) 1 ( PLC (cid:1) 1 ) can mediate phosphorylation of ERK1 / 2 , which is required for (cid:2) 1 integrin activation . Paradoxically , we found that inhibition of PLC (cid:1) 1 phosphorylation by the general PLC inhibitor U73122 was associated with a delayed and reduced phosphorylation of ERK1 / 2 and reduced migration of T lymphocytes on fibronec - tin . To further characterize the relationship between ERK1 / 2 and PLC (cid:1) 1 , we reduced PLC (cid:1) 1 levels by 85 % using shRNA and observedareducedphosphorylationofERK1 / 2andasignificant lossofCCR7 - mediatedmigrationofTlymphocytesonfibronec - tin . In addition , we found that inhibition of ERK1 / 2 phosphory - lation by U0126 resulted in a decreased phosphorylation of PLC (cid:1) 1 , suggesting a feedback loop between ERK1 / 2 and PLC (cid:1) 1 . Overall , these results suggest that the CCR7 signaling pathway leading to T lymphocyte migration on fibronectin is a (cid:2) 1 integrin - dependent pathway involving transient ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation , which is modulated by PLC (cid:1) 1 . G protein - coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) 2 are responsive to many types of stimuli , such as hormones , neurotransmitters , and chemoattractants . Ligand activation of a GPCR leads to a conformational change in the receptor , resulting in an exchange of GDP for GTP in the G (cid:1) subunit and dissociation of G (cid:1) from the G (cid:2)(cid:3) subunits . The subunits then initiate down - stream signaling events to regulate the activation state of aden - ylyl cyclase or phospholipase C ( PLC ) ( 1 ) . CCR7 ( C - C chemo - kine receptor 7 ) , a G protein - coupled receptor , is expressed on naive T lymphocytes and is required for migration into and within lymph nodes . CCR7 binds to two ligands , CCL19 and CCL21 . CCL21 is expressed in high endothelial venules , the entry route into lymph nodes ( 2 ) . However , it is currently unknown how T lymphocytes signal through CCR7 to mediate migration via (cid:2) 1 integrins in response to CCL21 . Integrins , which are key mediators of lymphocyte adhesion and migration , are heterodimeric adhesion proteins consisting of an (cid:1) and a (cid:2) subunit , for which they are named . (cid:2) 1 integrins , which are expressed by T lymphocytes , bind to the vascular cell adhesion molecule , collagen , and fibronectin ( 3 ) . Fibronectin is a major component of the lymph node and is highly expressed in the cortex in the presence of fibroblastic reticular cells , which express CCL21 ( 4 , 5 ) . This network provides an environment that allows CCR7 - expressing T lymphocytes to migrate throughout the lymph node . PLC (cid:2) is a downstream target of G (cid:2)(cid:3) signaling and is impor - tant for T cell migration ( 6 ) . PLC (cid:3) binds to and activates (cid:2) 1 integrins ( 7 ) . Furthermore , PLC (cid:3) 1 is required for adhesion to fibronectin and is important for (cid:2) 1 integrin - mediated cell migration ( 8 , 9 ) . PLC (cid:3) 1 was recently shown to be phosphory - lated in response to CCR7 activation in head and neck cancer cells and was necessary for the migration of squamous cell car - cinoma cells ( 10 ) . GPCRs can activate the downstream effector MAPKs to reg - ulate chemotactic migration ( 11 , 12 ) . In HEK293 cells , CCR7 transient transfectants stimulated with CCL19 rapidly acti - vated ERK1 / 2 ( extracellular signal - related kinase 1 / 2 ) , whereas CCL21 had a minimal effect on ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation ( 13 ) . In primary B lymphocytes that express endogenous CCR7 , CCL21 mediated sustained activation of ERK1 / 2 for 10 min ( 11 ) . These contrasting studies illustrate the importance of determining the role of ERK1 / 2 in the migration of primary T lymphocytes to CCL21 . Therefore , we examined the molecular mechanisms required for (cid:2) 1 integrin activation and (cid:2) 1 integrin - mediated migration . We found that in primary T lymphocytes , CCL21 promotes the activation of PLC (cid:3) 1 and the transient activation of ERK1 / 2 , which are required for (cid:2) 1 integrin activation in response to CCL21 . Loss of activation of either PLC (cid:3) 1 or transient phos - phorylation of ERK1 / 2 prevented migration via (cid:2) 1 integrins to CCL21 . These results indicate that CCL21 activation of CCR7 promotes the activation of (cid:2) 1 integrins , leading to migration following phosphorylation of PLC (cid:3) 1 and ERK1 / 2 . * Theworkwassupported , inwholeorinpart , byNationalInstitutesofHealth Grant P20 RO16443 from the National Center for Research Resources and National Institutes of Health Grant K22AIP60815 from NIAID ( to C .

U0126 ( Calbiochem ) , U73122 and U73343 ( Biomol ) , pertussis toxin ( List Biological Laboratories ) , human PLC (cid:3) 1 shRNA ( OriGene ) , and species - specific CCL19 and CCL21 ( R & D Systems ) were purchased . The 12G10 anti - human activated (cid:2) 1 integrin antibody was gen - erously provided by Dr . Martin Humphries ( University of Manchester , Manchester , UK ) , and the MAB1959 function - blocking antibody was purchased ( Millipore ) . T Lymphocyte Isolation —Human blood was collected from volunteer donors , and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated using a Ficoll - Paque gradient ( GE Healthcare ) . Whole blood was transferred to 50 - ml conical tubes and diluted at a 1 : 1 ratio with PBS (cid:1) Ca 2 (cid:1) / Mg 2 (cid:1) ( Cellgro ) . In a separate 50 - ml conical tube , 15 ml of Ficoll - Paque was layered with 35 ml of whole blood / PBS (cid:1) Ca 2 (cid:1) / Mg 2 (cid:1) and centrifuged for 20 min at 100 (cid:2) g without the brake . The middle layer containing lym - phocytes was isolated , washed , and pelleted . T lymphocytes were negatively selected using the EasySep kit ( Stemcell Tech - nologies ) according to the manufacturer’s protocol . Lympho - cytes were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium ( Invitrogen ) , 10 % heat - inactivated FBS ( Hyclone ) , and 2 n M L - glutamine ( Invitro - gen ) in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C and 5 % CO 2 for use within 3 days of isolation . Chemotaxis Assays —All chemotaxis assays were carried out using a 48 - well chemotaxis chamber ( Neuroprobe ) . Lower wells were loaded with 0 or 10 n M to 2 (cid:4) M CCL21 in serum - free RPMI 1640 medium and were separated from the upper wells containing the lymphocytes using a 5 - (cid:4) m pore nitrocellulose membrane ( Neuroprobe ) that had been preincubated in either serum - free RPMI 1640 medium or 10 (cid:4) g / ml fibronectin ( Sigma ) . Primary human T lymphocytes ( 5 (cid:2) 10 5 ) were allowed to migrate in a humidified , 37 °C , 5 % CO 2 chamber for 2 h to gradients of CCL21 . For (cid:2) 1 integrin function - blocking studies , primary human T lymphocytes were mixed with 10 (cid:4) g / ml MAB1959 or an isotype control prior to loading in the migra - tion chamber . Following migration , chambers were disassem - bled , and lymphocytes in the bottom chamber were collected and counted by hemocytometer or fixed in 2 % paraformalde - hyde and then counted using a hemocytometer . In each assay , migration of cells to serum - free RPMI 1640 medium was con - sidered the “0” migration point , and all migration values were normalized to that point . Assays were performed in duplicate and replicated a minimum of three times . Western Blots —Lymphocytes were pretreated in serum - free medium with U0126 ( 1 (cid:4) M ) for 90 min , U73122 ( 2 (cid:4) M ) for 20 min , or pertussis toxin ( 100 ng / ml ) fo r 2 h at 37 °C . Lympho - cytes were then stimulated with 8 n M CCL19 or CCL21 for 0 , 2 , 5 , 7 , and 10 min . Lymphocytes were then lysed in radio immu - noprecipitation assay buffer ( 100 m M Tris , pH 8 . 0 , 150 m M NaCl , 2 % Nonidet P - 40 , 1 % sodium deoxycholate , and 0 . 2 % SDS ) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture ( Sigma ) , 1 m M sodium orthovanadate , 1 m M sodium pyrophosphate , 10 m M sodium fluoride ( Sigma ) , and 1 m M (cid:2) - glycerophosphate ( Sigma ) for 15 min on ice . Lysates were sheared , and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 14 , 000 (cid:2) g for 20 min . Supernatants ( 5 (cid:2) 10 5 cell equivalents per time point ) were mixed with Laemmli sample buffer , fractionated on 7 . 5 % SDS polyacrylamide gels , and transferred to PVDF membranes . Membranes were preincubated in 5 % milk / Tris - buffered saline ( TBS ; 50 m M Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 150 m M NaCl ) , 0 . 1 % TBS with Tween 20 ( TBST ) , or 5 % BSA / TBST ( Sigma ) and probed with anti - phospho - ERK1 / 2 , anti - total ERK1 / 2 , anti - total PLC (cid:3) 1 , or anti - phospho - PLC (cid:3) 1 antibody ( Cell Signaling Technology ) . Primary antibodies were detected with HRP - conjugated anti - species - specific IgG ( Pierce ) , and immune complexes were visualized with SuperSignal West Femto substrate ( Pierce ) . Membranes were stripped using Blotfresh ( SignaGen Labora - tories ) , rinsed in 1 (cid:2) TBST , blocked , and re - probed . Protein bands were quantified using ImageJ software . PLC (cid:3) 1 shRNA Transfection —Primary human T lymphocytes were transiently transfected with human PLC (cid:3) 1 shRNA ( Ori - Gene TF302445 ) or control shRNA ( Origene TR30015 ) using LipoD293 ( SignaGen ) according to the manufacturer’s instruc - tions . Briefly , PLC (cid:3) 1 or control ( 8 (cid:4) g ) shRNAs and LipoD293 were diluted into DMEM . Diluted LipoD293 was added to the diluted shRNA and incubated for 15 min , and the LipoD293 - shRNA complexes were added to the lymphocytes . Lympho - cytes were incubated with the complexes in complete medium for 72 h at 37 °C and 5 % CO 2 prior to assay . (cid:2) 1 Integrin Activation Assay —Lymphocytes were treated with U0126 or pertussis toxin or transfected with PLC (cid:3) 1 shRNA , as described previously . Lymphocytes were unstimu - lated ( 0 min ) or stimulated ( 0 . 5 – 5 min ) with 400 n M CCL19 or CCL21 . Following stimulation , lymphocytes were submerged in 1 ml of ice - cold 1 (cid:2) PBS . Lymphocytes were labeled with 0 . 1 (cid:4) g / ml 12G10 on ice for 30 min ( or overnight ) , washed in 1 (cid:2) PBS two times , incubated with FITC - conjugated anti - mouse secondary antibody ( Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories ) for 30 min , and washed in 1 (cid:2) PBS two times . Lymphocytes were fixed in 2 % paraformaldehyde and analyzed with the FACSCalibur flow cytometer . All integrin levels were normal - ized to the mean fluorescence level of integrins found on vehicle control cells ( control ) for each experiment . Statistics —All migration and (cid:2) 1 integrin activation assays were analyzed by two - tailed , unpaired Student’s t test . A p value of (cid:3) 0 . 05 was considered statistically significant . RESULTS Primary Lymphocytes Differentially Migrate to CCL21 on Fibronectin —Naive T lymphocytes , which express CCR7 , enter the lymph nodes in response to CCL21 found in high endothe - lial venules . To define the molecular mechanisms that control CCL21 - mediated T lymphocyte migration , we used chemotaxis assays . Naive T lymphocytes were induced to migrate over a physiological range of CCL21 concentrations ( 10 n M to 2 (cid:4) M ) or in the absence of CCL21 . We found that naive T lymphocytes migrated maximally to 2 (cid:4) M CCL21 on polycarbonate mem - branes ( Fig . 1 A ) . To understand how T lymphocytes migrate via (cid:2) 1 integrins , we preincubated the polycarbonate membranes with the (cid:2) 1 integrin ligand fibronectin .

To confirm that the cells were migrating via (cid:2) 1 integrins , we examined the migration in the presence of (cid:2) 1 integrin function - blocking antibodies . Under these conditions , the cells failed to migrate across the fibronec - tin - coated membranes . Isotype controls had no effect on migration ( data not shown ) . These results implicate (cid:2) 1 integrins in human T lymphocyte migration to CCL21 . ERK1 / 2 Is Required for Migration to CCL21 —GPCRs can activate ERK1 / 2 to mediate the migration of human primary macrophages and human osteosarcoma cells ( 12 , 14 ) . To examine the role of ERK1 / 2 in the migration of naive T lympho - cytes to CCL21 via their (cid:2) 1 inte - grins , we examined migration to CCL21 in the presence of the MEK inhibitor U0126 . Under these con - ditions , naive T lymphocytes failed to migrate on fibronectin compared with controls treated with an equiv - alent dilution of vehicle ( dimethyl sulfoxide ; p (cid:4) 0 . 031 ) ( Fig . 2 A ) . We used Western blotting to confirm that U0126 blocked MEK activation of ERK1 / 2 . As expected , U0126 blocked ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation in cells treated with CCL21 ( Fig . 2 B ) . PLC (cid:3) can mediate the phosphory - lation of ERK1 / 2 ( 15 , 16 ) . To exam - ine the contribution of ERK1 / 2 to activation of PLC (cid:3) 1 , we probed for PLC (cid:3) 1 phosphorylation . Unexpect - edly , we found that phosphorylation ofPLC (cid:3) 1wasalsodecreased ( Fig . 2 B ) . Fromtheseresults , weconcludedthat rapid ERK1 / 2 activation is required for migration to CCL21 . Further - more , PLC (cid:3) 1 phosphorylation may be mediated by activated ERK1 / 2 to regulate CCL21 - mediated migration . Cell migration requires regulated integrin adhesion , which is medi - ated by activation , followed by inte - grin de - adhesion ( 17 , 18 ) . There - fore , we questioned the role of ERK1 / 2 in (cid:2) 1 integrin activation . To this end , we pretreated lympho - cytes with U0126 or an identical dilution of the vehicle ( dimethyl sulfoxide ) and measured the levels of activated (cid:2) 1 integrins following acti - vation with CCL21 . To examine the state of the (cid:2) 1 integrins , lymphocytes werestainedwithanactivation - specificantibody , 12G10 ( 19 ) . Lev - els of activated (cid:2) 1 integrins were analyzed by flow cytometry . We found that lymphocytes treated with U0126 displayed similar (cid:2) 1 integrin activation compared with vehicle controls ( control ) ( Fig . 2 C ) . Fromthesedata , weconcludedthat (cid:2) 1integrinactivationinT lymphocytes in response to stimulation of CCR7 with CCL21 is not regulated by ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation . FIGURE1 .

CCR7 / CCL21 Migration via (cid:2) 1 Integrins Is Mediated by PLC (cid:1) 1 DECEMBER 10 , 2010• VOLUME 285•NUMBER 50 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 38783 by gu e s t on M a r c h 14 , 2015 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m PLC Is Required for Migration on Fibronectin to CCL21 —As mentioned previously , PLC (cid:3) 1 binds to and activates (cid:2) 1 inte - grins ( 7 ) . Because the loss of ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation corre - lated with decreased PLC (cid:3) 1 phosphorylation and reduced migration to CCL21 , we questioned if PLC was necessary to control migration to CCL21 . To this end , we used chemotaxis assays in the presence of U73122 , a universal PLC inhibitor , or the U73343 control ( Fig . 3 A ) . To confirm that U73122 blocked activation of PLC (cid:3) in T lymphocytes in response to CCL21 stimulation , we assayed for phosphorylation of PLC (cid:3) 1 by Western blotting . Lym - phocytes pretreated with U73122 displayed decreased phosphoryla - tion of PLC (cid:3) 1 compared with the U73343 - treated controls ( Fig . 3 B ) . Although U73122 blocked all migration , it was unclear why the U73343 control shifted the migra - tory response of cells . In contrast to the U73343 - treated cells , phos - phorylation of ERK1 / 2 was de - layed in the U73122 - treated cells ( Fig . 3 B ) . When T lymphocytes were preincubated with U73122 , migration to CCL21 was reduced compared with U73343 - treated controls ( Fig . 3 A ) . From these results , we concluded that rapid phosphorylation of PLC and / or ERK1 / 2 mediates the migration of T lymphocytes to CCL21 . PLC (cid:3) 1 Is Necessary for (cid:2) 1 Inte - grin Migration and Activation —Be - cause U73122 is a universal inhibi - tor of PLC , to determine the role PLC (cid:3) 1 in the migration of naive T lymphocytes via (cid:2) 1 integrins , we used PLC (cid:3) 1 shRNA to specifically target and knockdown levels of PLC (cid:3) 1 in primary human T lym - phocytes . Lymphocytes were tran - siently transfected with PLC (cid:3) 1 shRNA or control shRNA and assayed for (cid:2) 1 integrin activation and migration . Using NIH Image - Quant software , we found that total PLC (cid:3) 1 levels were reduced by (cid:5) 85 % in the shRNA - transfected lymphocytes ( Fig . 4 A ) . T lympho - cytes that were depleted of PLC (cid:3) 1 failed to migrate to 400 n M CCL21 on fibronectin - coated membranes , as opposed to T lymphocytes treated with control shRNA ( Fig . 4 B ) . In addition , the loss of PLC (cid:3) 1 led to a failure to activate (cid:2) 1 inte - grins in response to stimulation with 400 n M CCL21 , as deter - mined by flow cytometry ( Fig . 4 C ) . Because we observed delayed ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation in response to U73122 , we questioned whether this was due to an inhibition of PLC (cid:3) 1 . We observed that the knockdown of PLC (cid:3) 1 resulted in a trend toward a rapid and sustained increased ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation compared with controls ( Fig . 4 , D and E ) . From these results , we concluded that PLC (cid:3) 1 is required for rapid ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation and activation of (cid:2) 1 inte - grins , resulting in the migration of naive T lymphocytes to CCL21 on fibronectin .

CCR7 / CCL21 Migration via (cid:2) 1 Integrins Is Mediated by PLC (cid:1) 1 38784 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 285•NUMBER 50• DECEMBER 10 , 2010 by gu e s t on M a r c h 14 , 2015 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m G (cid:1) i Mediates Migration to CCL21 —To examine the signal - ing events upstream of PLC (cid:3) 1 , we investigated the role of G proteins in the activation of PLC (cid:3) 1 . CCR7 couples to G (cid:1) i to initiate downstream signaling events and is required for migration to CCL21 ( 2 ) . Therefore , to examine signaling events more proximal to the membrane that mediate activa - tion of PLC (cid:3) 1 , we pretreated lymphocytes with pertussis toxin . As expected , lymphocytes pretreated with pertussis toxin failed to migrate to any concentration of CCL21 com - pared with controls ( Fig . 5 A ) . Therefore , to determine the role of G (cid:1) i in signaling through CCR7 to mediate activation of PLC (cid:3) 1 and ERK1 / 2 in the presence of pertussis toxin , we assayed for changes in phosphorylation of PLC (cid:3) 1 and ERK1 / 2 in response to stimulation with 400 n M CCL21 . In pertussis toxin - treated lymphocytes , phosphorylation of ERK1 / 2 and PLC (cid:3) 1 was reduced following treatment with CCL21 compared with controls ( Fig . 5 B ) . These results indi - cate that CCR7 coupling to G (cid:1) i mediates PLC (cid:3) 1 and ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation and (cid:2) 1 integrin deactivation , leading to the migration of T lymphocytes on fibronectin . To determine the extent to which G (cid:1) i affects (cid:2) 1 integrin activation in naive T lymphocytes , we pretreated lympho - cytes with pertussis toxin , stimulated with 400 n M CCL21 , and assayed by flow cytometry for activated integrins on the cell surface . In the presence of pertussis toxin , CCL21 induced the same level of (cid:2) 1 integrins as in the CCL21 - stimulated vehicle control cells ( p (cid:4) 0 . 365 ) ( Fig . 5 C ) , although cell migration to CCL21 in the presence of pertus - sis toxin was lost compared with control cells . In addition , there was a significant elevation in the levels of activated (cid:2) 1 integrins when lymphocytes were treated with CCL21 in the pres - ence ( p (cid:4) 0 . 0014 ) or absence ( p (cid:4) 0 . 0236 ) of pertussis toxin com - pared with unstimulated controls in the presence or absence of per - tussis toxin , respectively . There was no significant difference in the levels of activated integrins with or without pertussis toxin prior to treatment with ligand ( p (cid:4) 0 . 365 ) . Because cell migration requires the control of integrin adhesion ( activation ) and de - adhesion ( deactivation ) , from these studies , we concluded that signaling through G (cid:1) i leads to cycling of adhesion and de - adhesion states . To test this hypothesis , we exam - ined the activation state of the (cid:2) 1 integrins over time ( Fig . 5 D ) . We found that although the levels of activated (cid:2) 1 integrins varied over time in both pertussis toxin - treated cells and control cells , the levels of activation overlapped throughout the time course . These results suggest that G (cid:1) i is impor - tant for migration to CCL21 , but not for the initial activation of (cid:2) 1 integrins in response to CCL21 stimulation . DISCUSSION CCR7 is expressed on B lymphocytes , dendritic cells , natural killer cells , T regulatory cells , and naive T lymphocytes and is required for their migration into and within lymph nodes . CCR7 binds to two ligands , CCL19 and CCL21 . Although many studies have described CCL19 signaling through CCR7 , little is known about how CCL21 signals through CCR7 , leading to migration on fibronectin ( 20 – 23 ) . High endothelial venules and lymph nodes express substan - tial amounts of fibronectin ( 1 ) . As lymphocytes enter into and migrate through lymph nodes , they use (cid:2) 1 integrins for adhe - sion and migration ( 2 ) . Because CCL21 is required for lymph node entry as well as migration within the lymph nodes , it was important to define the CCL21 - mediated mechanisms that control (cid:2) 1 integrin - mediated migration on fibronectin . In this study , we have provided evidence that CCL21 induces (cid:2) 1 inte - grin activation and promotes migration on fibronectin via PLC (cid:3) 1 and ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation . GPCRs are well known for their ability to activate MAPKs ( 24 , 25 ) . MAPKs , which are involved in many cellular processes , including migration ( 26 – 28 ) . Several groups have reported that stimulation of CCR7 by CCL21 mediates phosphorylation of the MAPK ERK1 / 2 in primary murine T lymphocytes , B lym - phocytes , and HEK293 CCR7 - transfected cells ( 11 , 13 , 29 ) . However , from these studies , it is difficult to interpret what if any role ERK1 / 2 plays in the migration of T lymphocytes . In this study , similar to previous studies , we have reported that FIGURE 5 . G (cid:3) i mediates cell migration to CCL21 and (cid:2) 1 integrin activation . Primary naive T lymphocytes were pretreated with pertussis toxin . After 72 h , cells were ( A ) assayed for PLC (cid:3) expression and migration through5 - (cid:4) mporefibronectin ( 10 (cid:4) g / ml ) - coatedmembranesto400n M CCL21 ( n (cid:4) 3 ; p (cid:4) 0 . 0331forpertussis toxin ( PTX ) versus vehiclecontrolcells ) , ( B ) Western - blottedforphospho - PLC (cid:3) , stripped , andre - probedfortotal PLC (cid:3) orforphospho - ERK1 / 2 , stripped , andre - probedfortotalERK1 / 2 ( n (cid:4) 3 ) , or ( C and D ) stimulatedwith400 n M CCL21 for the indicated times and assayed for levels of activated (cid:2) 1 integrins ( 12G10 ) by flow cytometry . CCR7 / CCL21 Migration via (cid:2) 1 Integrins Is Mediated by PLC (cid:1) 1 DECEMBER 10 , 2010• VOLUME 285•NUMBER 50 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 38785 by gu e s t on M a r c h 14 , 2015 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m ERK1 / 2 is rapidly and transiently phosphorylated in response to CCR7 activation by CCL21 in primary human T lympho - cytes . In addition , we found that rapid and transient phosphor - ylation of ERK1 / 2 is required for migration to CCL21 via CCR7 on the (cid:2) 1 integrin ligand fibronectin . Transient activation of ERK1 / 2 has been shown to be impor - tant for aortic smooth cell migration ( 30 ) . We used the MEK inhibitor U0126 to demonstrate that phosphorylation of ERK1 / 2 is important for T cell migration in response to CCL21 . In addition , using PLC (cid:3) 1 shRNA , we found that ERK1 / 2 phos - phorylation was sustained , which correlated with decreased migration to CCL21 . Taken together , these results suggest that rapid and transient phosphorylation of ERK1 / 2 is important for migration to CCL21 in T lymphocytes . Stimulation of human epidermoid carcinoma cells with 12 ( S ) - hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid results in PLC (cid:3) 1 phosphor - ylation and downstream activation of ERK1 / 2 via pertussis toxin - sensitive signaling events ( 31 ) . In our study , we found that transient phosphorylation of ERK1 / 2 is lost following reduction of PLC (cid:3) 1 levels , suggesting that PLC (cid:3) 1 contributes to the transient phosphorylation of ERK1 / 2 . We determined that not only is ERK1 / 2 important for migration , but that PLC (cid:3) 1 is also important for regulating states of ERK1 / 2 activa - tion . These states of ERK1 / 2 activation appear to play an impor - tant role in (cid:2) 1 integrin deactivation . As mentioned previously , cell migration requires regulated integrin adhesion ( activation ) followed by de - adhesion ( inacti - vation ) . Interestingly , we found that G (cid:1) i activation was not nec - essary for (cid:2) 1 integrin activation , even though pertussis toxin inhibited migration to CCL21 . Furthermore , we found that per - tussis toxin alone did not increase levels of activated (cid:2) 1 inte - grins , although the levels of activated (cid:2) 1 integrins increased in the presence of CCL21 . Similar to pertussis toxin - treated cells , we found that in the presence of U0126 , (cid:2) 1 integrins could be activated , yet migration to CCL21 was inhibited . Because per - tussis toxin led to reduced levels of phosphorylation of ERK1 / 2 , we speculated that G (cid:1) i and possibly ERK1 / 2 are not required for the initial activation of (cid:2) 1 integrins ; however , they are required for de - adhesion ( inactivation ) of (cid:2) 1 integrins . G (cid:1) i is bound to the resting CCR7 . Inhibition of G (cid:1) i with pertussis toxin , however , inhibits rapid ERK1 / 2 phosphoryla - tion and phosphorylation of PLC (cid:3) 1 , but leads to activation of (cid:2) 1 integrins . In contrast , a reduction in PLC (cid:3) 1 levels following treatment with PLC (cid:3) 1 shRNA blocked integrin activation . One possible explanation is that separate pools of PLC (cid:3) 1 may be activated by CCR7 . In that case , one pool could control (cid:2) 1 inte - grin activation , whereas the second pool would control the phosphorylation state of effectors such as PLC (cid:3) 1 and ERK1 / 2 . In the absence of G (cid:1) i , (cid:2) 1 integrins would be activated ; however , the lymphocytes would be unable to regulate PLC (cid:3) 1 activity to allow for de - adhesion of the (cid:2) 1 integrins , and the integrins would remain activated . Alternatively , following treatment with shRNA , other PLCs could be depleted . We concluded that it is the de - phosphorylation of ERK1 / 2 that is important for (cid:2) 1 integrin recycling and migration to CCL21 . Studies are cur - rently under way in our laboratory to sort out these hypotheses . T lymphocytes are crucial mediators of inflammation , auto - immune disorders , allergic disease , and cancer . Migration is not only important for a normal , functioning immune system , but is also important in disease . Therefore , it is important to under - stand the molecular mechanisms of how T lymphocytes migrate into and throughout lymph nodes to become effector cells to carry out immune responses in the periphery . This study is an important step in further understanding the molec - ular mechanisms that regulate T lymphocyte migration to CCL21 and provide the basis for pharmacological targets for controlling T cell entry and migration within lymph nodes to regulate the immune response .
