In plants , clathrin - mediated endocytosis is essential for physiology and devel - opment , but the identiﬁcation and organization of the machinery operating this process remains largely obscure . Here , we identiﬁed an eight - core - component protein complex , the TPLATE complex , essential for plant growth via its role as major adaptor module for clathrin - mediated endocytosis . This complex consists of evolutionarily unique proteins that associate closely with core endocytic elements . The TPLATE complex is recruited as dy - namic foci at the plasma membrane preceding recruitment of adaptor protein complex 2 , clathrin , and dynamin - related proteins . Reduced function of different complex components severely impaired internalization of assorted endocytic cargoes , demonstrating its pivotal role in clathrin - mediated endocytosis . Taken together , the TPLATE com - plex is an early endocytic module representing a unique evolutionary plant adaptation of the ca - nonical eukaryotic pathway for clathrin - mediated endocytosis . INTRODUCTION The plasma membrane ( PM ) forms a fundamental barrier of the cell to communicate with the outside world . Plant cells can remove and add receptors , channels , and other membrane pro - teins in response to endogenous stimuli such as hormones ( Du et al . , 2013 ; Irani et al . , 2012 ; Marhavy´ et al . , 2011 ; Robert et al . , 2010 ; Sutter et al . , 2007 ) , nutrient availability ( Barberon et al . , 2011 ; Takano et al . , 2010 ) , and pathogen defense ( Bar et al . , 2009 ; Robatzek et al . , 2006 ) . The process by which membrane materials and extracellular cargoes are internalized is called endocytosis ( McMahon and Boucrot , 2011 ) . Clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) is the best - characterized endo - cytic pathway in eukaryotes and is deﬁned by the involvement of the vesicle coat scaffold protein clathrin . CME requires a series of highly coordinated steps consisting of nucleation , cargo selection , vesicle coat assembly , scission , and vesicle uncoating ( McMahon and Boucrot , 2011 ) . The het - erotetrameric adaptor protein complex 2 ( AP2 ) represents the core complex for CME in animal cells . Here , clathrin - coated pit nucleation at the PM is hallmarked by the arrival of a clathrin triskelion in association with two AP2 complexes in a phospha - tidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate PI ( 4 , 5 ) - P 2 - dependent manner . This priming complex subsequently recruits more AP2 - clathrin com - plexes and adaptor proteins required for clathrin coat stabilization ( Cocucci et al . , 2012 ; Henne et al . , 2010 ; Kukulski et al . , 2012 ) . Among these adaptor elements , the muniscin pro - teins , complexed with intersectin , epsin , and EGFR pathway Cell 156 , 691 – 704 , February 13 , 2014 ª 2014 Elsevier Inc . 691 substrate 15 ( Eps15 ) proteins ( Henne et al . , 2010 ; Mayers et al . , 2013 ; Reider et al . , 2009 ) associate to the rim of the assembling coat ( Tebar et al . , 1996 ) , where they are believed to stabilize bilayer curvature ( Cocucci et al . , 2012 ) . Budding and eventual scission of the nascent vesicle depends on the enzyme activity of the GTPase dynamin . After detachment , the vesicle is uncoated to allow fusion with endosomal compartments . The cargo then trafﬁcs further within the endomembrane system and the endocytic machinery can be recycled ( McMahon and Boucrot , 2011 ) . Many aspects of CME are evolutionarily conserved as can be inferred from the presence of obvious homologs of several CME effectors in plant , animal , and yeast genomes . However , impor - tant kingdom - speciﬁc modiﬁcations are also evident . Strikingly , AP2 , muniscins , and dynamin are crucial for cargo selection and vesicle scission in human or zebraﬁsh cells ( Cocucci et al . , 2012 ; Henne et al . , 2010 ; Macia et al . , 2006 ; Umasankar et al . , 2012 ) , but some are dispensable in yeast or worm ( Mayers et al . , 2013 ; Smaczynska - de Rooij et al . , 2010 ; Yeung et al . , 1999 ) . On the other hand , CME in yeast depends strongly on actin dynamics , while the actin cytoskeleton is only required for CME in animal cells under high turgor pressure ( Mooren et al . , 2012 ) . This implies that important features of CME have diverged signiﬁcantly during evolution . In plants , several evolutionarily conserved CME components can be recognized ( Chen et al . , 2011 ) , including clathrin ( Dho - nukshe et al . , 2007 ; Kitakura et al . , 2011 ; Wang et al . , 2013 ) , the actin cytoskeleton ( Nagawa et al . , 2012 ) , dynamin - related proteins ( DRP ) ( Boutte´ et al . , 2010 ; Collings et al . , 2008 ; Fujimoto et al . , 2010 ; Konopka et al . , 2008 ) , and adaptor proteins ( Bar et al . , 2008 ; Barth and Holstein , 2004 ; Lam et al . , 2001 ; Song et al . , 2012 ) . While this indicates similarity to yeast and an - imal endocytosis , a broad range of animal - or yeast - like adaptor and accessory proteins are absent from plants , suggesting a profound divergence in eukaryote CME ( Chen et al . , 2011 ) . We previously identiﬁed TPLATE as a plant - speciﬁc interactor of clathrin , suggesting a CME - related function ( Van Damme et al . , 2011 ) . Here , we show that TPLATE is part of a unique multi - subunit protein complex ( the TPLATE complex , TPC ) that acts in concert with the AP2 complex , dynamin - related proteins and clathrin , and that the complex is essential for plant survival . The early TPC recruitment to endocytic foci , the lack of clear yeast and animal homologs , and a requirement of the complex for CME support the hypothesis that the TPC represents an evolutionary modiﬁcation of early - adaptor function for CME in plants . RESULTS The Multisubunit TPC Is Connected to CME Machinery Previously , we identiﬁed TPLATE as a plant - speciﬁc protein with a similar developmental mutant phenotype as the Arabidopsis dynamin drp1c . Copuriﬁcation with clathrin furthermore sug - gested that TPLATE functions in membrane trafﬁcking ( Backues et al . , 2010 ; Van Damme et al . , 2006 ; Van Damme et al . , 2011 ) . Clathrin coats are abundant at the plant trans - Golgi Network / early endosome ( TGN / EE ) , as well as at the PM ( Konopka et al . , 2008 ) . In interphase Arabidopsis root cells , clathrin light chain2 ( CLC2 ) and TPLATE only colocalized at the PM ( Fig - ure 1A ) , which favors a role for TPLATE in clathrin - dependent processes occurring at the PM , rather than at the TGN / EE . We used tandem afﬁnity puriﬁcation ( TAP ) experiments in PSB - D Arabidopsis suspension - cultured cells to identify puta - tive TPLATE interactors . Four independent TAP experiments with TPLATE as bait reproducibly identiﬁed seven interacting proteins of unknown function with molecular weights ( MW ) ranging from 17 kDa to 176 kDa . We named these TASH3 , AtEH1 , AtEH2 , LOLITA , TML , TWD40 - 1 , and TWD40 - 2 based on the presence of speciﬁc protein domains ( Figure S1A and Tables S1 , S2 , S3 available online ) . An in silico comparison of all TPC subunits against human and yeast genomes showed that the TPC subunits have no obvious counterparts in those kingdoms , although they likely share a common evolutionary origin with trafﬁcking proteins ( Table S1 ) . A total of 28 reverse TAP experiments using these seven TPLATE prey proteins as baits reciprocally recovered all eight in - teractors with very high efﬁciency ( Figure 1B ; Tables S2 and S3 ) , suggesting that they represent a stable complex of eight core components , which we named the TPLATE complex ( TPC ) . Two - dimensional ( 2D ) Blue - Native / SDS - PAGE revealed that both TPLATEand TMLappeared as monomersand incorporated into larger protein complexes of various sizes up to approxi - mately 800 kDa ( Figure S1B ) . Without posttranslational modiﬁca - tions , the combined molecular mass of the eight subunits in the TPC complex identiﬁed by chromatography was estimated to be 918 kDa ( Table S1 ) , which corresponds well with the 2D - PAGE observations . The range of complex sizes might reﬂect different stages of complex assembly / disassembly or complex degradation during extraction and / or gel separation . Furthermore , coimmunoprecipitation ( coIP ) experiments ( Fig - ure S1C ) , yeast two hybrid experiments ( Y2H ) and bimolecular ﬂuorescence complementation ( BiFC ) assays ( Figures S1D and S1E ) independently conﬁrmed interactions between several of the subunits of this complex . The reverse TAP experiments also revealed a link between the TPC and members of the dyna - min protein family ( DRP1A , DRP1C , DRP1E , DRP2A , and DRP2B ) and the small ( AP2S ) and alpha1 ( AP2A1 ) subunits of the Arabidopsis AP2 Adaptor protein complex ( Di Rubbo et al . , 2013 ; Yamaoka et al . , 2013 ) . Subsequent TAP experiments in cell suspensions using clathrin heavy chain1 ( CHC1 ) as bait re - vealed additional interactions with other subunits of the clathrin scaffold ( Figure 1B ; Tables S2 and S3 ) . In addition , afﬁnity - puri - ﬁcation experiments using functional TPLATE - GFP or TML - YFP followed by mass spectrometry analysis ( APMS ) and by western blotting ( coIP ) conﬁrmed the composition of the TPC in planta and its relation with DRPs , CLCs , CHCs , and AP2 . Moreover , these APMS experiments identiﬁed two proteins containing an AP180 N - terminal homology ( ANTH ) domain ( AtECA4 and CAP1 ; Figures 1B , 1C , and S1A ; Tables S1 , S2 , and S3 ) . Notably , in silico searches revealed putative clathrin - binding boxes , AP2 complex recognition motifs , and sorting motifs in many subunits of the TPC ( Figure S1A ) . Taken together , we demonstrate that TPLATE assembles into a robust multimeric protein complex that physically interacts with DRPs , AP2 complex subunits , ANTH domain - containing proteins , and clathrins , supporting its involvement in CME . 692 Cell 156 , 691 – 704 , February 13 , 2014 ª 2014 Elsevier Inc . The TPC Functions at the PM and Is Required for Pollen Development Similar to the tplate , clc1 , and drp1c mutants ( Backues et al . , 2010 ; Van Damme et al . , 2006 ; Wang et al . , 2013 ) , which function in CME and produce unviable pollen grains , mutants in four newly identiﬁed TPC subunits displayed a fully penetrant pollen defect causing male sterility . Six mutant alleles of four subunits of the TPC showed failure in male transmission of the mutation ( Figure S2A ; Table 1 ) . In agreement with an essential role of these proteins for pollen development , these phenotypes also corre - lated with the occurrence of shriveled and normal pollen in a 1 : 1 ratio revealed by scanning electron microscopy analysis ( Fig - ures 2A and S2B ) . In contrast , female transmission of the muta - tion occurred normally or with slightly decreased ratios ( Table 1 ) . All subunits of the identiﬁed complex localized exclusively to the PM in Arabidopsis root cells ( Figure S2C ) . Moreover , expres - sion of ﬂuorescent fusion protein - tagged forms of TML ( TML - FFP ) under control of its endogenous promoter rescued the male transmission failure of both tml - 1 and tml - 2 mutant alleles ( Table 1 ) , demonstrating that TML - FFP is functional . Confocal microscopy revealed recruitment of TML fusions to the PM and the growing cell plate in Arabidopsis root cells ( Figures 2B , 2C , Figure 1 .

These localizations are in agreement with previous reports on TPLATE and DRP localizations ( Konopka et al . , 2008 ; Van Damme et al . , 2006 ; Van Damme et al . , 2011 ) . Further - more , the identical localizations and mutant phenotypes of indi - vidual TPC subunits strongly conﬁrm our proteomics data of a single multimeric protein complex . The TML subunit has a m homology domain ( m HD ) in its C terminus ( Table S1 ; Figure S1A ) that generally is involved in membrane interactions , cargo recognition , and binding and recruitment of accessory proteins ( McMahon and Boucrot , 2011 ) . In contrast to full - length TML , truncating the m HD ( TML D C ) or expression of the C - terminal part of this domain ( GFP - CtermTML ) resulted in cytoplasmic localization ( Figures 2F – 2I ) . Furthermore , APMS experiments using TML D C as bait could not recover certain TPC core components ( Figure S2D ; Tables S2 and S3 ) and caused a reduction in TPC complex size ( Figure S2E ) , suggesting that an intact m HD of TML is required for PM recruitment and for full TPC assembly . The m HD is a common feature of adaptor proteins such as the medium subunit adaptins ( AP1 to 5 ) , the cargo - speciﬁc stonins , delta COPI proteins , the SH3 - containing GRB2 - like protein 3 - in - teracting protein 1 ( SGIP1 ) , suppressor of yeast proﬁlin 1 ( SYP1 ) , and FCH domain - only ( FCHo ) proteins . We performed an extensive phylogenetic analysis of all above - mentioned protein families encoded in human , yeast , Arabidopsis , and a set of evolutionarily diverse plant species . For all major classes of APs , plant , yeast , and animal homologs clustered together , while TML and its homologs clustered with the muniscin proteins SGIP1 and FCHo / SYP1 ( Reider et al . , 2009 ) ( Figures 2J and S2F ) , further suggesting that the TML containing TPC functions as an early endocytic adaptor complex in plants . TPC Recruitment at the PM Is an Early Event of CME Typically , CME is characterized by dynamic recruitment and as - sembly of different effector proteins at the PM ( Boettner et al . , 2012 ; Cocucci et al . , 2012 ; Henne et al . , 2010 ; McMahon and Boucrot , 2011 ) . The close proteomic relationship of TPC compo - nents with the core CME machinery , and the PM localization of these proteins , prompted us to characterize their dynamic local - ization at the PM ( Figures 3A and S3 ) . Similar to AP2A1 - GFP and CLC2 - mORANGE , TPC components including TPLATE - , TML - , AtEH1 - , AtEH2 - , LOLITA - , and TASH3 - GFP dynamically Table 1 .

Quantiﬁcation of the dynamic behavior of TPLATE - , TML - , and AP2A1 - positive foci showed that they had comparable average dwell times at the PM ranging between 7 and 38 s ( Figure 3B ) . Consistent with a function in a common process , TML - positive foci showed a high degree of colocalization with both CLC2 and DRP1C ( (cid:3) 70 % and (cid:3) 80 % respectively , Figures 3C and 3D ) . In nearly all of the colocalizing foci , TML was recruited to the PM earlier than or concomitant with CLC2 ( Figures 3C and 3D ; Movie S2 ) . DRP1C , which has a late function in CME ( Fuji - moto et al . , 2010 ; Konopka et al . , 2008 ) , was consistently re - cruited late to the TML - positive foci ( Figures 3C and 3D ; Movie S3 ) . These observations suggest that recruitment of the TPC to the PM marks early events of CME in plants . The TPC Functions in Concert with AP2 during Early CME During CME in higher eukaryotes , the heterotetrameric AP2 complex is essential for cargo recognition and initiation of coat formation via clathrin recruitment to the PM ( Cocucci et al . , 2012 ; Collins et al . , 2002 ) . Our proteomics approach linked several members of the TPC with AP2A1 and AP2S , two subunits of the Arabidopsis heterotetrameric AP2 complex ( Di Rubbo et al . , 2013 ; Yamaoka et al . , 2013 ) . In addition , AP2A1 showed similar dynamic behavior as TPC subunits ( Figures 3A and 3B ; Movie S1 ) , it colocalized exclusively at the PM with TPLATE and TML , and AP2A speciﬁcally coimmunoprecipitated with TPLATE ( Figures S4A and S4B ) . To further elucidate the relationship between AP2 and the TPC , we visualized their dynamic behavior at the PM ( Figures 4A , 4B , S4C , and S4D ; Movies S4 and S5 ) . The majority of the ﬂuorescent foci containing TPLATE and TML colocalized with AP2A1 . A time - course analysis of the dynamic behavior of these foci followed by time - projection of the individual frames exceeding the average life - times of the foci at the PM ( t = 50 s ) , revealed the occurrence of three different populations of dynamic foci . Roughly 50 % of foci showed colocalization be - tween TPLATE / TML and AP2A1 . In addition , two populations of foci occurred that only recruited either TPLATE / TML ( (cid:3) 30 % ) or AP2A1 ( (cid:3) 20 % ; Figure 4C ) . Both TPLATE and TML colocalized with AP2A1 with similar ratios , consistent with their function in a common complex . The occurrence of these three populations of endocytic foci suggests that the TPC and AP2 have overlapping , but also distinct functions . To establish the order of recruitment between the different complexes , we performed a detailed anal - ysis of those foci that acquired both TPLATE / TML and AP2A1 . We found a strong , yet not exclusive tendency for TPC subunits to arrive at the PM prior to AP2 and to remain present after AP2 removal by vesicle scission ( Figures S4C and S4D ) . Together , these data support the idea that the TPC acts as an early modulator of CME in concert with AP2 . Endocytosis at the PM Requires a Functional TPC The recruitment of TPC subunits to endocytic foci at the PM , together with the male gametophytic phenotype , suggests a pivotal function for this complex in CME but the lethal phenotype also inhibits any functional genetic approach . We therefore used an artiﬁcial micro RNA ( amiR ) - based silencing approach ( Schwab et al . , 2006 ) to unravel the somatic function of this com - plex . Constitutive silencing using amiR constructs directed against TPLATE or TML ( amiR - TPLATE and amiR - TML ) resulted in poorly developing seedlings that died before forming true leaves . This phenotype correlated with a substantial reduction of TPLATE or TML mRNA levels ( Figures S5A and S5B ) and cor - roborates that the TPC proteins are essential for plant survival . Notably , the transcript level for the medium subunit of the Arabidopsis C - terminal m HD - containing AP2 complex subunit AP2M was upregulated in amiR - TML seedlings ( Figure S5B ) , excluding unspeciﬁc silencing of AP2M . To investigate whether constitutive knockdown of TML and TPLATE in seedlings impaired endocytosis , we used the endocytic tracer FM4 - 64 . In wild - type Arabidopsis roots , a short - term FM4 - 64 pulse labels the PM and subsequently early endosomes on its way to the vac - uole ( Dettmer et al . , 2006 ) . In contrast , in seedlings expressing the amiR - TPLATE or amiR - TML , uptake of FM4 - 64 from the PM into endosomes was strongly inhibited ( Figures S5A and S5B ) . The endocytic defect was visualized more prominently by application of the fungal toxin Brefeldin A ( BFA ) , which aggre - gates early endosomes ( TGN / EE ) in so - called BFA bodies and blocks recycling of internalized membrane to the PM ( Geldner et al . , 2003 ) . As a consequence , endocytosed material becomes trapped in the aggregated TGN / EE ( Dettmer et al . , 2006 ; Geldner et al . , 2003 ; Grebe et al . , 2003 ) . Quantiﬁcation of both BFA body distribution and FM4 - 64 ﬂuorescence intensity showed a clear reduction both in the amount of BFA bodies and in dye accumu - lation in roots expressing amiR - TML as compared to wild - type ( Figure S5C ) . The seedling lethality of constitutive silencing was overcome by expressing the amiR - TML and amiR - TPLATE under an estradiol inducible promoter ( Curtis and Grossniklaus , 2003 ) . Estradiol - induced expression of amiR - TML and amiR - TPLATE substantially reduced mRNA levels of both genes and caused severe seedling growth retardation , decreased root apical meri - stem size , bulging of root epidermal cells that reﬂect defective root hair morphogenesis ( Figures S5D – S5G ) , and ultimately seedling lethality . We also observed defects in graviperception compared to control lines or lines grown without induction ( Fig - ure S5H ) and block of FM4 - 64 uptake in root cells ( Figure S5I ) as observed with the constitutively silenced lines . Following BFA treatment , FM4 - 64 prominently decorated BFA - bodies in control lines , while only a very faint internalized FM4 - 64 signal could be detected in the induced amiR - TML lines ( Figure 5A ) . To investi - gate a more general role for the TPC in CME , we examined the trafﬁcking of a GFP - tagged form of the brassinosteroid ( BR ) receptor , BR insensitive1 ( BRI1 ) in inducible amiR - TML lines . BRI1 - GFP cycles constitutively between the PM and TGN / EE ( Geldner et al . , 2007 ) , and its internalization depends on clathrin ( Irani et al . , 2012 ) . Consistent with a broad CME - related function of the TPC , the induction of amiR - TML correlated with an increased BRI1 - GFP labeling of the PM compared to control seedlings ( Figure 5A and 5B ) . The endosomal aggregation of BRI1 furthermore demonstrated that the BFA effect was not impaired after induction of the amiR - TML ( Figure 5A ) . This cor - roborates that the reduced labeling of BFA bodies by FM4 - 64 in the induced amiR - TML seedlings was due to a defect in Cell 156 , 691 – 704 , February 13 , 2014 ª 2014 Elsevier Inc . 695 ( legend on next page ) 696 Cell 156 , 691 – 704 , February 13 , 2014 ª 2014 Elsevier Inc . endocytic uptake of the dye , and thus highlighted a general defect in endocytosis . In addition , the recently reported AlexaFluor 647 - coupled cas - tasterone ( AFCS ) , which acts as a ligand of BRI1 , readily labeled the vacuolar lumen in control seedlings , but did not internalize in estradiol - induced amiR - TML cells ( Figure 5C ) . Taken together , the enhanced PM accumulation of BRI1 and the inhibition of AFCS uptake in amiR - TML lines are in agreement with defective endocytosis of BRI1 ( Irani et al . , 2012 ) upon downregulation of TML expression . Silencing of TML also reduced the accumula - tion of endogenous AP2A at the PM and forming cell plates ( Fig - ure 5D ) which links the observed BRI1 and AFCS internalization defects in the amiR - TML seedlings to the AP2 - dependent inter - nalization of BRI1 and AFCS ( Di Rubbo et al . , 2013 ) . The polarly localized auxin transport proteins PIN1 and PIN2 ( Petra ´ sek et al . , 2006 ) are internalized via CME ( Kitakura et al . , 2011 ) and their endocytic dynamics can be readily visualized by BFA treatment ( Dhonukshe et al . , 2007 ; Geldner et al . , 2001 ; Tanaka et al . , 2009 ) . In agreement with a general function for the TPC in CME , the accumulation of internalized PIN1 and PIN2 in BFA bodies was severely reduced in induced amiR - TML seedlings compared to controls ( Figure 5E and 5F ) . Another reported defect caused by general inhibition of both clathrin and dynamin function is the ectopic accumulation of the cytokinesis - speciﬁc syntaxin KNOLLE at the PM and cortical division zone ( Boutte´ et al . , 2010 ) . Consistent with a general defect in CME , we found that many recently divided cells in induced amiR - TML roots showed ectopic KNOLLE localization , while such patterns were rarely observed in control roots ( Fig - ure 5G and 5H ) . In summary , the alteration in internalization and localization of several well - established cargoes of CME highlights the TPC as an essential novel regulator of early events of CME . This notion is further supported by the observation that silencing of TML results in a lower abundance of AP2A at the PM and cell plates . DISCUSSION CME is the most prominent mode of endocytic cargo internaliza - tion in higher eukaryotes ( Boettner et al . , 2012 ; Chen et al . , 2011 ; McMahon and Boucrot , 2011 ) . While the overall mechanism of CME and many of its molecular components appear evolution - arily conserved in eukaryotes ( Boettner et al . , 2012 ; Conibear , 2010 ) , different proteins and cargo recognition strategies are also evident . Hence , to grant a deeper understanding of CME and its evolution , it is necessary to identify the functional CME constituents in different eukaryotic kingdoms . Here , we report the identiﬁcation of the TPLATE complex con - sisting of eight core components that drives CME in the model plant Arabidopsis . This complex is comprised of the previously identiﬁed plant - speciﬁc adaptor protein TPLATE ( Van Damme et al . , 2006 ; Van Damme et al . , 2011 ) as well as seven previously uncharacterized proteins ( Figure 6 ) . Notably , we found that the TPC subunits physically and genetically interact with multiple conserved CME regulators ( Backues et al . , 2010 ; Kang et al . , 2003 ; Wang et al . , 2013 ) , showed dynamic recruitment to foci at the PM with similar average dwell times as AP2 , clathrin , and dynamin proteins ( Konopka et al . , 2008 ) and are required for endocytosis of diverse cargo proteins and endocytic tracers . While our data clearly points to the existence of a high molecular weight protein complex containing the eight identiﬁed subunits and associated components and a role of the m HD of TML in full TPC complex assembly , speciﬁc intermolecular relationships and the exact spatio - temporal formation of this complex still remain to be unraveled . TPC Functions in Concert with AP2 at the PM Although several of the TPC components contain domains pre - sent in yeast and animal CME adaptors , the protein components of the TPC do not have any obvious homologs in yeast and ani - mals , supporting the notion that adaptor - related proteins have substantially diverged during evolution ( Chen et al . , 2011 ) . With the exception of AtEH1 and AtEH2 , not a single hit could be iden - tiﬁed for any TPC subunit in these model species at a more strin - gent E - value cutoff of e - 10 , indicating that the identiﬁed complex is plant - speciﬁc . Nevertheless , the in silico analysis does show that TPC subunits likely share a common evolutionary origin with membrane trafﬁcking proteins in other kingdoms . Notably , some TPC subunits have features reminiscent of an endocytic hub complex that contains FCHo , Eps15 , and Intersectin , required to stabilize initial AP2 recruitment to the PM in animal cells ( Cocucci et al . , 2012 ; Henne et al . , 2010 ; Mayers et al . , 2013 ; Umasankar et al . , 2012 ) . TML is related to SYP1 and FCHo , suggesting a potential role for TMLs as muniscin - like adaptors in plants . Moreover , AtEH1 and AtEH2 contain an EH domain architecture and have Eps15Like - 1 and Intersectin Figure 2 .

Therefore , a possible scenario may be that these sub - units represent an AP2 - recruiting unit in plant cells . Consistent with this hypothesis , the AP2 - and TPC - related proteins colocal - ized in dynamic endocytic foci at the PM in over 50 % of all foci analyzed , and silencing of TML resulted in a lower abundance of AP2A at the PM and cell plates .

We further demonstrate that the arrival of TPC subunits at the PM in Arabidopsis epidermal cells preceded DRP , and AP2 in the majority of foci examined and slightly preceded , or was concom - itant with , clathrin recruitment . This reveals the TPC as the earliest marker of plant CME . Moreover , TPC subunits typically remained at the PM after AP2 removal , possibly through scission of the endocytic vesicle , again reminiscent of the FCHo - Eps15 - Intersectin rim complex that is excluded from the budded coated vesicle in animal cells ( Cocucci et al . , 2012 ) . Consequently , the TPC behaves in a manner comparable to several well - deﬁned yeast and animal CME regulators , despite the low degree of sequence homology between them . While much of the AP2 and TPC proteins dynamically colocal - ized at the PM , we observed many dynamic endocytic spots labeled exclusively by the TPC , which might explain the persis - tence of dynamic clathrin foci at the PM in AP2 s mutants ( Fan et al . , 2013 ) . Although we did not analyze the dynamics of clathrin foci in TML or TPLATE silenced lines , we did ﬁnd that TML silencing severely reduced PM recruitment of AP2A , sug - gesting that the TPC could be important to stabilize AP2 at the PM in the foci where AP2 and TPC co - occur . Also , a minor fraction of foci only recruited AP2 subunits , sug - gesting that the TPC and AP2 can also exist independently , and if certain subunits of the TPC can recruit or stabilize AP2 at the PM , Figure 4 .

As the colocalization exper - iments were performed on genetic knockout mutants of TPLATE and TML , dynamic TPC - negative but AP2 - positive foci cannot be the result of competition between the endogenous and ﬂuo - rescent forms of these proteins . While it is unclear if all foci corre - spond to recognition and internalization of speciﬁc cargo , or perhaps also to nonfunctional adaptor recruitment at the PM , it is clear that loss of TPC function is detrimental to CME and plant development . The latter is likely caused by strong effects on endocytosis leading to severe misregulation of signaling and ( E and F ) Representative immunolocalizations and quantiﬁcation of ﬂuorescence intensity in BFA bodies of endogenous PIN1 and PIN2 proteins after BFA treatment ( 50 m M ; 30 min ) in control seedlings ( F estradiol ) or seedlings expressing amiR - TML grown on beta - estradiol ( ami estradiol ) .

On the other hand , loss of AP2 function in plants only results in very mild phenotypic outcomes ( Fan et al . , 2013 ; Kim et al . , 2013 ; Yamaoka et al . , 2013 ) . These observations suggest that the TPC represents the main endocytic adaptor - related complex of plants . The TPC Is Required for the Internalization of a Multitude of Endocytic Cargo Molecules If the TPC acts as the major adaptor complex for CME in plants , serious defects in internalization of endocytic markers in TPC compromised cells can be anticipated . Constitutive and induc - ible silencing of TPLATE and TML strongly inhibited the uptake of the endocytic tracer FM4 - 64 and the recently reported BRI1 ligand AFCS ( Irani et al . , 2012 ) . The latter is reminiscent of the blocked AFCS uptake in clathrin - impaired Arabidopsis root cells which also leads to pronounced accumulation of AFCS at the cell surface ( Irani et al . , 2012 ) . Given the strong plant phenotypes re - sulting from the expression of HUB1 ( Kitakura et al . , 2011 ) , DN - ARA7 ( Dhonukshe et al . , 2008 ) , and amiR - TML , a general defect in endocytosis could result in altered cell wall composition and therefore a changed afﬁnity of AFCS to this compartment . The AFCS uptake corroborates the link between the TPC and clathrin and is in agreement with the drastic inhibition of ligand uptake upon FCHo downregulation in animal cells ( Henne et al . , 2010 ) . Furthermore , the trafﬁcking of several PM proteins associated with signaling , polarity and transport was altered in TPC deﬁcient cells . This shows that the TPC is associated with the internaliza - tion of many different types of cargo molecules . Our ﬁndings show that plants have evolved a distinct adaptor complex consisting of eight core proteins that regulates CME . The overall protein sequences of the subunits have diverged to the extent that no reliable homology can be inferred beyond the presence of speciﬁc domains . Yet , these proteins may have retained unrecognized structural homology to animal and yeast counterparts . This works as an intriguing example for how a conserved process , such as CME , holds proteins with drastic changes in protein sequences that fulﬁll related biolog - ical functions . We therefore propose that the discovery of the TPC , together with knowledge about the CME machineries in yeast and animals , may form a solid platform to explore evolu - tionary questions related to adaptor - cargo recognition and discrimination . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES A detailed overview of all experimental procedures can be found in the Extended Experimental Procedures . Protein Complex Isolation Tandem afﬁnity puriﬁcation ( TAP - tag ) experiments were performed on Arabidopsis cell culture cells ( PSB - D ) with protein G and Streptavidin - binding peptide ( GS ) - tagged bait proteins according to ( Van Leene et al . , 2011 ) . APMS and coIP experiments for TPLATE - GFP , TML - GFP , and TML - YFP were performed using a GFP - trap system ( Chromotek and Miltenyi Biotec ) on Arabidopsis seedlings expressing functional fusion proteins in the respec - tive complemented mutant ( tplate , tml - 1 , and tml - 2 ) backgrounds . APMS ex - periments on GFP - TML , GFP - TML D C , and Venus - TML D C were performed on Arabidopsis seedlings in the wild - type ( Col - 0 ) background or on PSB - D cells . Phylogenetic Analysis Protein sequences were aligned using MSAProbs v0 . 97 ( Liu et al . , 2010 ) and cleaned up as described in ( Vandepoele et al . , 2004 ) . ProtTest v2 . 4 ( Abascal et al . , 2005 ) was used to score different models of protein evolution and iden - tiﬁedtheLG + I + G + Fmodelasbestﬁt , withasubstantialleadoverothermodels . MrBayes v3 . 1 . 2 ( Huelsenbeck and Ronquist , 2001 ) was used for constructing thephylogeny . TheBMCMCwasrunfor10 6 generations , withtwoparallelruns of four chains each , sampling every 100 generations and discarding the ﬁrst 2 , 500 samples as burn - in . Proper MCMC convergence was checked using the AWTY web program ( Nylander et al . , 2008 ) and the remaining 7 , 501 samples were used to construct the 50 % majority - rule consensus phylogeny . VAEM and Spinning Disc Microscopy Variable angle epiﬂuorescence ( VAEM ) and spinning disc microscopy were conducted on a Nikon Ti microscope equipped with either a manual VAEM arm or a CSU - X1 spinning disc head ( Yokogawa , Tokyo , Japan ) equipped with a CFI Apo TIRF 100 3 NA1 . 49 oil immersion objective and an Evolve EMCCD camera ( Photometrics Technology , Tucson AZ , USA ) . Quantiﬁcation of Fluorescence Intensities Quantiﬁcations of ﬂuorescence intensities were done on nonsaturated images by normalizing the maximal ﬂuorescence intensity present in BFA bodies or cell plates to the respective PM or cytoplasmic intensity by indicating them as a ROI using the Olympus FluoViewer10 - ASW 2 . 1 or the imageJ ( Rasband , W .
