A new aspect of cell membrane structure is presented , based on the dynamic clustering of sphingolipids and cholesterol to form rafts that move within the ﬂuid bilayer . It is proposed that these rafts function as platforms for the attachment of proteins when membranes are moved around inside the cell and during signal transduction . In the prevailing view of cellular membrane structure , lipids in the bilayer function mainly as a solvent for membrane proteins 1 . But in the ﬂuid bilayer , different lipid species are asymmetrically distrib - uted over the exoplasmic and cytoplasmic leaﬂets of the membrane 2 . The lipids are also organized in the lateral dimension and impose more short - and long - range order than was previously recognized 3 . This lateral organization probably results from prefer - ential packing of sphingolipids and cholesterol into moving plat - forms , or rafts , onto which speciﬁc proteins attach within the bilayer . We now propose a model for membrane structure that describes the organization of these lipid microdomains and we present evidence that proteins can selectively be included or excluded from these microdomains . We conclude that the function of these microdomains is to serve as rafts for the transport of selected membranes or as relay stations in intracellular signalling . The concept In epithelial cells , plasma membranes are polarized into apical and basolateral domains 4 , with the former being enriched in sphingolipids ( glycosphingolipidsandsphingomyelin ) andthelatterintheglycerolipid phosphatidylcholine 2 , 5 . Mixing of sphingolipids and phosphatidyl - choline , bothofwhicharelocalizedtotheexoplasmicleaﬂet , isprevented by the tight junctions between the two cell - surface domains 2 , 5 . Studies on the delivery of newly synthesized sphingolipids in epithelial MDCK cells showed that a simple glycosphingolipid , glucosylceramide , was preferentially transported to the apical membrane 5 , 6 . To explain delivery to the apical domain , it was proposed that glycosphingolipid clusters formed within the exoplasmic leaﬂet of the Golgi membrane 5 : these microdomains were considered to be sorting centres for proteins destined for delivery to the apical plasma membrane . In support of this model , glycosylphosphatidylinositol ( GPI ) - anchored proteins use glyco - lipid anchors as apical sorting determinants 7 . Moreover , caveolae , small invaginations of the plasma membrane that are devoid of clathrin coats and are present in many cell types 8 , contain clusters of glycosphingolipids 9 and need cholesterol to function 10 . As caveolae may be involved in endocytosis 9 and transcytosis 11 , a function for sphingolipid rafts in membrane trafﬁcking was plausible 12 . General properties of raft lipids A model for the organization of sphingolipid – cholesterol rafts is shown in Fig . 1 ( and see Table 1 ) . In this model , sphingolipids associate laterally with one another , probably through weak inter - actions between the carbohydrate heads of the glycosphingolipids . The sphingolipid head groups occupy larger excluded areas in the plane of the exoplasmic leaﬂet than do their predominantly satu - rated lipid hydrocarbon chains . Any voids between associating sphingolipids are ﬁlled by cholesterol molecules which function as spacers ( Fig . 1b ) . The close - packed sphingolipid – cholesterol clus - ters behave as assemblies within the exoplasmic leaﬂet , where the intervening ﬂuid regions are occupied by unsaturated phosphatidyl - choline molecules ( Fig . 1a ) . Glycosphingolipids usually carry a long fatty acid which is amide - bonded to the sphingosine base and can interdigitate with the cytoplasmic leaﬂet of the bilayer 13 ( but see ref . 14 ) . As cholesterol is present in both leaﬂets 2 , it functions as a spacer in the cytoplasmic leaﬂet as well , ﬁlling voids created by interdigi - tating fatty acid chains ( Fig . 1b ) . The nature of the phospholipids occupying the cytoplasmic side of the microdomain is unknown , but they will probably also be carrying mainly saturated fatty acid chains to optimize packing . Individual lipids may move in and out of the rafts 3 , explaining why sphingolipid – cholesterol clustering is difﬁcult to detect spectroscopically 13 . Detergent - insoluble complexes Sphingolipid – cholesterol rafts are insoluble in the detergent Triton X - 100 at 4 (cid:56) C , in which they form glycolipid - enriched complexes 7 , 15 . Because of their high lipid content , these detergent - insoluble , glycolipid - enriched complexes ( DIGs ) ﬂoat to a low density during gradient centrifugation 7 , which enables any associated pro - teins to be identiﬁed and distinguishes DIGs from other detergent - insoluble complexes . Milder detergents such as octylglucoside will solubilize lipid rafts 16 . Glycosphingolipids are insoluble by them - selves , and sphingomyelin is resistant to detergent extraction in the presence of cholesterol 16 . One problemwith Triton X - 100 extraction is that the original subcellular locations of DIGs are unknown . Confusion has been created because sphingolipid rafts in apical transport vesicles , in caveolae , and even in plasma membranes from cells devoid of morphologically recognizable caveolae , all form DIGs after Triton X - 100 extraction 17 – 19 . Only by isolating speciﬁc organelles before detergent extraction can the origin of DIGs be determined ; neither can it be assumed that two proteins are in contact with each other on the basis of their partioning into DIGs . Proteins associated with rafts Lipid rafts can bind proteins ( Fig . 1a ) : GPI - anchored proteins , transmembrane proteins 17 , 18 , 20 and doubly acylated tyrosine kinases of the Src family 21 all associate with rafts and are incorporated into DIGs .

Nature © Macmillan Publishers Ltd 1997 transmembrane protein 17 , and GPI - anchored proteins 7 become incorporated into DIGs after being transported from the endo - plasmic reticulum ( ER ) to the Golgi complex and then remain insoluble . This delay in DIG association during intracellular transport may be due to the absence of sphingolipid – cholesterol rafts in the ER . Although cholesterol is synthesized in the ER , raft assembly can occur ﬁrst in the Golgi complex , where sphingolipids are synthesized 2 . InvestigationoftheassociationofGPI - anchoredproteinswithraftshas shown that extraction of cholesterol by saponin renders these proteins soluble in Triton X - 100 at 4 (cid:56) C ( ref . 22 ) . Also , interaction with raft lipids confers detergent insolubility on a GPI - anchored protein 16 , and the association of GPI - anchored proteins with DIGs in vivo is affected by cholesterol and sphingolipids 23 , 24 . For GPI - anchored proteins , the lipid anchor with its two ( usually ) saturated fatty acyl chains determines raft association 21 . Double acylation by saturated chains , as in Src - family kinases , may determine preferential partitioning into rafts . For transmembrane proteins , membrane - spanning domains can confer an afﬁnity for rafts 25 . Another membraneprotein found in DIGs is caveolin 8 : this localizes to caveolaeand to post - Golgi transport vesicles and binds cholesterol , which may explain its association with DIGs 26 ( Fig . 1c ) . Role of rafts in membrane trafﬁcking Biosynthetic trafﬁc . The intracellular transport of sphingolipid – cholesterol rafts has been studied in the MDCK cell line . It is the apical route that preferentially transports sphingolipid – cholesterol rafts carrying GPI - anchored proteins and apical transmembrane proteins ( Fig . 2 ) . Like GPI anchors 27 and speciﬁc membrane - spanning regions 25 , N - glycans may also be used as apical sorting signals 28 . Some proteins may depend solely on binding to their N - glycans to raft - associated lectins 29 for apical delivery , whereas others with membrane anchors could partition into the rafts directly . But basolateral delivery depends on signals originating from the cytoplasmic domains of basolaterally targeted proteins . These signals usually involve tyrosine or dileucine motifs , as do clathrin - coated - pit signals 30 . As basolateral proteins are also N - glycosylated , how can this be reconciled with N - glycans being apical sorting determinants ? It is likely that most cytoplasmic basolateral signals have a higher afﬁnity for their adaptors than do N - glycans for the putative apical lectins . Basolateral proteins lacking their cytoplas - mic tails are sorted to the apical side , presumably as a result of their carbohydrate chains linking to apical lectins 28 , 30 . As well as having different sorting signals , apical and basolateral delivery in MDCK cells differs at the stages of vesicular docking and fusion 31 : the basolateral route uses the same type of machinery as that described for ER – Golgi , intra - Golgi and synaptic vesicle transport 32 , whereas apical delivery uses a different docking and fusion mechanism that is still poorly deﬁned 31 ( Fig . 2 ) . Fibroblasts that have no cell - surface polarity also have apical and basolateral cognate routes from the trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) to the plasma membrane 33 , 34 ( Fig . 2 ) . The same sorting signals that in MDCK cells direct proteins to basolateral transport vesicles also act in transport from the Golgi to the cell surface . Moreover , there are different vesicular docking and fusion machineries in ﬁbroblasts as well as MDCK cells 34 . Endocytic trafﬁc . Sphingolipid – cholesterol rafts are involved in transporting proteins in the endocytic pathways . Endocytosis from the apical surface involves both the clathrin - coated vesicle pathway and another less well deﬁned route to endosomes underlying this membranedomain 35 . Thereareno caveolae on the apical membrane of enterocytes 35 or of MDCK cells ( R . Parton , personal communi - cation ) . Therefore , caveolae cannot be responsible for the clathrin - independent route . Instead , shallower surface invaginations ( 72 – 250 nm deep ) may endocytose GPI - anchored proteins 35 . Caveolae are found , together with clathrin - coated pits , on the basolateral surface of MDCK cells ( R . Parton , personal commu - nication ) . In contrast to coated pits , which are constitutively endocytosed , caveolae remain attached to the plasma membrane in most cell types , with their release being effected by unknown signals . In endothelia , caveolae are involved in transcytosis across the cell layer 11 , 36 . Potocytosis , another pathway of internalization 37 , is regulated by the reversible closing and opening of caveolae and progress 570 NATURE | VOL 387 | 5 JUNE 1997 Figure 1 Model for the organization of rafts and caveolae in the plasma membrane . Therafts ( red ) segregatefromtheotherregions ( blue ) ofthebilayerin which unsaturated phosphatidylcholine is predominantly in the exoplasmic leaﬂet , which has a different organization of intercalated cholesterol from that in the rafts 66 . a , Rafts contain proteins attached to the exoplasmic leaﬂet of the bilayer by their GPI anchors , proteins binding to the cytoplasmic leaﬂet by acyl tails ( the Src - family kinase Yes is shown ) , or proteins associating through their transmembrane domains , like the inﬂuenza virus proteins neuraminidase and haemagglutinin ( HA ) ( these proteins associate with DIGs in virus membranes ) . However , if cholesterol is removed by cyclodextrin extraction from the envelope , the virus glycoproteins become soluble in Triton X - 100 at 4 (cid:56) C ( P . Scheiffele and K . S . , unpublishedresults ) . b , Thelipidbilayerinraftsisasymmetric , withsphingo - myelin ( red ) and glycosphingolipids ( red ) enriched in the exoplasmic leaﬂet and glycerolipids ( for example , phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine ; green ) inthecytoplasmicleaﬂet .

Nature © Macmillan Publishers Ltd 1997 can also internalize SV40 virus and deliver it to the ER 38 . Both caveolar endocytosis and transcytosis are blocked by agents that sequester cholesterol 10 , 36 , although clathrin - mediated endocytosis is unaffected 39 . Two post - Golgi circuits ? Wesuggestthattherearetwo routesformembranetrafﬁcwhichconnect the Golgi complex with the cell surface . One transports membrane proteins that have sorting signals in their cytoplasmic domains 32 , the other handles sphingolipid – cholesterol rafts and proteins asso - ciating with them . Proteins will also be endocytosed by raft routes and by clathrin - coated vesicles , and some proteins will cycle back to the Golgi complex . According to the model , the two circuits will intersect in the different organelles involved in post - Golgi trafﬁc ( Fig . 2 ) . Merging of the circuits will demand the appropriate sorting and delivery at each site to ensure that raft components are always segregated from proteins tagged by cytoplasmic signals . There are examples of proteins with cytoplasmic signals being reversibly converted into proteins that move into the raft circuit in vivo 40 . A raft - associating protein could be shifted to the other circuit by reversible binding to a protein with cytoplasmic sorting signals . We need to understand how the post - Golgi circuits are adapted to serve different cell types . For instance , the apical and basolateral route maps are not identical in all epithelial cells 40 . In hepatocytes there is no apical route from the TGN to the apical surface . Instead , apical proteins are ﬁrst transported to the basolateral surface and then delivered by transcytosis to the apical side 40 . This change in the epithelial trafﬁc map could be accomplished by diverting the biosynthetic raft route , connecting the TGN directly with the apical side in MDCK cells or to the basolateral side in hepatocytes by locating the appropriate docking machinery there . Other polar - ized cells such as hippocampal neurons have a route equivalent to the apical pathway for delivery of proteins and lipids from the Golgi complex to axons , whereas a basolateral cognate route supplies the dendrites 41 . An unusual example of a modulated raft circuit is used in the massive delivery of galactosylceramide from the Golgi complex to produce the extensive myelin sheets in oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells which are required for myelination 42 . An inter - esting instance of preferential handling of proteins with basolateral sorting signals in ﬁbroblasts is the routing of such proteins to the rufﬂing edge and into growing processes 43 . Rafts in membrane signalling One advantage of the lateral organization of cell membranes is that proteins involved in signal transduction can be conﬁned to different lipid microdomains . Several signalling molecules partition into DIGs 15 , 44 , 45 : clustering of GPI - anchored proteins for example can activate different signalling pathways depending on the cell type . This clustering could lead to signal transduction in two ways . ( 1 ) Enzymes activated in the rafts involved in anchor release might yield water - soluble phospho - oligosaccharides ; these would have to be ﬂipped across the bilayer to be active as second messengers in the cytosol 46 . ( 2 ) Clustering of GPI anchors might lead to interaction with signal - transducing proteins that then become activated . A potential link is that two Src family kinases , Lck and Fyn , both implicated in T - cell activation , can be immuno - precipitated with GPI - anchored proteins after Triton X - 100 extrac - tion at 4 (cid:56) C ( ref . 21 ) . But it is not clear how GPI - anchored proteins in the exoplasmic leaﬂet of the raft could communicate with doubly acylated tyrosine kinases in the cytoplasmic leaﬂet . Trimeric G proteins 47 and Ras also associate with DIGs . Ras binds to caveolin in its inactive GDP - bound state 48 , suggesting that caveolae are stores for inactive signalling molecules ; on the other hand , in its active GTP - bound form Ras facilitates recruitment of Raf to activated EGF receptors in caveolae 49 , indicating that caveolae function as active signalling depots . Lipids involved in signal transduction have also been localized to DIGs . These include phosphoinositides such as phosphatidyl - inositol - ( 4 , 5 ) - bisphosphate 50 and sphingomyelin , but the mem - brane topology of the parent sphingomyelin is controversial 51 , 52 . In signalling , the roles of caveolae and DIGs are ill - deﬁned 15 . Signalling can occur without caveolae , for example in T lymphocytes 19 . But caveolae may act as centres from which multiple signalling pathways originate 44 . Clustered GPI - anchored proteins and glycosphingolipids are both enriched in caveolae , suggesting that proteins and lipids associated with sphingolipid – cholesterol rafts might become trapped in caveolae 15 , 53 . Our hypothesis is that proteins associating with rafts present in the plasma membrane become ﬁxed in caveolae if they oligomerize . Caveolae would thus be caveolin - induced invaginations of sphingolipid – cholesterol microdomains that trap ‘multivalent’ proteins or lipid clusters associating with rafts more effectively than ‘monovalent’ forms . After trapping , the contents of the caveolae could be internalized and removed from the cell surface in a signal - dependent manner 8 . The general function of raft association in signal transduction may be to concentrate receptors for interaction with ligands and effectors on both sides of the membrane , thus speeding up binding during signalling and preventing inappropriate crosstalk between pathways . Importantly , the association of proteins with rafts can be modulated : some proteins can bind to other proteins in order to be excluded from rafts 54 and vice versa 55 . Perspectives Early observations leading to the proposal that glycosphingolipid microdomains function in apical protein transport in epithelial cells progress NATURE | VOL 387 | 5 JUNE 1997 571 Figure 2 Two postulated post - Golgi circuits in MDCK cells ( a ) and ﬁbroblasts ( b ) . Sorting in the raft circuit ( in red ) isbasedonsphingolipid – cholesterolmicrodomains functioning as sorting platforms to which vesicular integral membrane proteins ( VIPs ) associate as stabili - zers or as linkers to other proteins in the raft 29 . The other circuit ( in blue ) employs sorting signals in the cytoplas - mic tails as well as adaptor and coat proteins binding to them . The NSF – SNAP – SNARE – Rab system is used for vesiculardockingandfusioninthisbluecircuit ; inthered circuitspeciﬁcannexinsmaybeinvolved 67 . VIPsarealso in the basolateral vesicles in MDCK cells but their phy - sical state is different from that in apical vesicles , where theyarepartofalargeprotein – lipidcomplex ( K . S . andH . Virta , unpublished results ) . The red regions of the plasma membrane are sphingolipid – cholesterol rafts and the blue areas are PC - enriched regions . The exact arrangement of the post - Golgi trafﬁc map , including the return routes to the TGN , is still under investigation . Nature © Macmillan Publishers Ltd 1997 have been extended to include cholesterol as a co - organizer of the spingolipid domains . Generally , spingolipid – cholesterol rafts may be an essential feature of all organellar membranes involved in biosynthetic and endocytic trafﬁc beyond the ER . Rafts also help ensure speciﬁcity and ﬁdelity during signal transduction . In this view , proteins embedded in the membrane localize either to the clusters of sphingolipids and cholesterol or to the intervening ﬂuid regions of glycerolipids . Several proteins are known to depend on cholesterol 56 or on sphingolipids 57 for activity . Cholesterol inﬂuences lipid – protein interactions by increasing the thickness of the lipid bilayer . The increase in cholesterol concentration along the biosynthetic pathway may cause segregation of the proteins , depending on the lengths of their membrane - spanning domains 58 . It now remains to provide evidence for the functional signiﬁcance of lipid rafts in membrane trafﬁcking and signalling , assay the postulated segregation of sphingolipid – cholesterol clusters from unsaturated phosphatidyl choline molecules in the exoplasmic leaﬂet of cellular membranes , and to determine the structural basis for optimal packing of proteins and lipids in the lateral and transbilayer organization of microdomains .
