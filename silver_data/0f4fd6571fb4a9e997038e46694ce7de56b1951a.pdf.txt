Recombinant ﬁbrinogen reveals the differential roles of a - and c - chain cross - linking and molecular heterogeneity in ﬁbrin clot strain - stiffening . J Thromb Haemost 2017 ; 15 : 938 – 49 . Essentials • Fibrinogen circulates in human plasma as a complex mixture of heterogeneous molecular variants . • We measured strain - stiffening of recombinantly pro - duced ﬁbrinogen upon clotting . • Factor XIII and molecular heterogeneity alter clot elas - ticity at the protoﬁbril and ﬁber level . • This highlights the hitherto unknown role of molecular composition in ﬁbrin clot mechanics . Summary . Background : Fibrin plays a crucial role in hae - mostasis and wound healing by forming strain - stiffening ﬁbrous networks that reinforce blood clots . The molecu - lar origin of ﬁbrin’s strain - stiffening behavior remains poorly understood , primarily because plasma ﬁbrinogen is a complex mixture of heterogeneous molecular variants and is often contaminated by plasma factors that affect clot properties . Objectives and methods : To facilitate mechanistic dissection of ﬁbrin nonlinear elasticity , we produced a homogeneous recombinant ﬁbrinogen corre - sponding to the main variant in human plasma , termed rFib610 . We characterized the structure of rFib610 clots using turbidimetry , microscopy and X - ray scattering . We used rheology to measure the strain - stiffening behavior of the clots and determined the ﬁber properties by modeling the clots as semi - ﬂexible polymer networks . Results : We show that addition of FXIII to rFib610 clots causes a dose - dependent stiffness increase at small deformations and renders the strain - stiffening response reversible . We ﬁnd that c - chain cross - linking contributes to clot elasticity by changing the force – extension behavior of the protoﬁb - rils , whereas a - chain cross - linking stiffens the ﬁbers , as a consequence of tighter coupling between the constituent protoﬁbrils . Interestingly , rFib610 protoﬁbrils have a 25 % larger bending rigidity than plasma - puriﬁed ﬁbrin protoﬁbrils and a delayed strain - stiffening , indicating that molecular heterogeneity inﬂuences clot mechanics at the protoﬁbril scale . Conclusions : Fibrinogen molecular heterogeneity and FXIII affect the mechanical function of ﬁbrin clots by altering the nonlinear viscoelastic proper - ties at the protoﬁbril and ﬁber scale . This work provides a starting point to investigate the role of molecular heterogeneity of plasma ﬁbrinogen in ﬁbrin clot mechan - ics and haemostasis . Keywords : blood coagulation ; elasticity ; ﬁbrin ; polymers ; rheology ; turbidimetry . Introduction Fibrinogen is a ﬁbrous protein that assembles into an elastic ﬁbrin network upon vascular injury [ 1 ] . Biophysi - cal studies have shown that ﬁbrin networks can stiffen up to 1000 - fold when sheared or stretched [ 2 , 3 ] and the con - stituent ﬁbers can be stretched up to 4 - fold their original length without breaking [ 4 ] . These extraordinary nonlin - ear elastic properties appear to be crucial for clot func - tion , because mutations in ﬁbrinogen or its regulatory factors that affect ﬁbrin mechanics are associated with severe clotting disorders [ 5 ] .

Reitsma , 24 January 2017 © 2017 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis , 15 : 938 – 949 DOI : 10 . 1111 / jth . 13650 The structural origin of ﬁbrin’s nonlinear elastic behav - ior has been difﬁcult to elucidate because of ﬁbrin’s com - plex hierarchical structure . Fibrinogen monomers , which are built from two sets of A a , B b and c chains , assemble into double - stranded protoﬁbrils by non - covalent interac - tions [ 6 ] , and these bundle into ﬁbers that branch and percolate to form space - spanning networks ( Figs . 1A , 2A ) . The key challenge is therefore to separate contribu - tions from the molecular , protoﬁbril , ﬁber and network scales to ﬁbrin clot mechanics . This challenge has been partly met by characterizing individual ﬁbrin ﬁbers and molecules . Tensile tests on single ﬁbers revealed that their extensibility [ 7 , 8 ] and elasticity [ 9 ] are correlated with the length of a C connectors , suggesting that the elastomeric behavior of ﬁbrin clots originates from the composite structure of the ﬁbers , with rigid , folded domains inter - connected by ﬂexible linkers [ 10 ] . However , force spec - troscopy [ 11 , 12 ] and molecular simulations [ 13 ] of ﬁbrin molecules showed that forced unfolding of the coiled - coil domains and the c chains can also contribute . Further , ﬁbrin’s mechanical properties in vivo crucially depend on the presence of factor XIII ( FXIII ) , which catalyzes cova - lent cross - linking between monomers [ 14 ] . Cross - linking increases the stiffness of ﬁbrin networks [ 15 – 17 ] and pre - vents irreversible deformation of the ﬁbers [ 18 ] . Because FXIII forms c - chain cross - links within protoﬁbrils as well as a - chain cross - links between protoﬁbrils [ 19 ] , it proba - bly changes both the properties of the protoﬁbrils and the interactions between them . An important obstacle in tracing ﬁbrin clot mechanics down to the molecular scale is that ﬁbrinogen puriﬁed from human plasma , used in most studies , has a heteroge - neous molecular composition arising from partial prote - olytic degradation of the A a chains , resulting in three main ﬁbrinogen variants [ 20 – 22 ] and alternative splice variants [ 23 , 24 ] . These variants result in clots with marked differences in ﬁber diameter and network struc - ture [ 22 , 25 , 26 ] . Puriﬁed plasma ﬁbrinogen furthermore often contains variable amounts of other plasma proteins such as FXIII and ﬁbronectin [ 27 ] . To provide a more controllable experimental system , following the pioneering work of Gorkun et al . [ 28 ] , we here report the production and characterization of recom - binant human ﬁbrinogen having intact A a chains with 610 amino acids , corresponding to the main constituent of plasma ﬁbrinogen . We for the ﬁrst time produce the recom - binant protein , termed rFib610 , at a scale large enough to allow systematic study of the nonlinear viscoelasticity of reconstituted clots , thus complementing previous studies that focused on the linear ( micro ) rheology of recombinant ﬁbrin networks [ 29 ] and the mechanics of single ﬁbers [ 10 , 18 ] . We demonstrate that FXIII - mediated c - and a - chain cross - linking differentially act at the protoﬁbril and ﬁber levels to stiffen ﬁbrin clots and suppress plastic deformation . Additionally , we uncover the inﬂuence of molecular heterogeneity on the force – extension behavior of individual protoﬁbrils .

Comparison of the molecular composition of recombinant rFib610 and plasma pFib ﬁbrinogens . ( A ) Schematic representation of ﬁbrinogen structure . Fibrinogen is a hexamer composed of two sets of three polypeptide chains , referred to as A a , B b and c . The carboxy - terminal portion of each A a chain forms an a C region that is connected by an unstructured a C connector to the E region . Fibrinogen is converted to ﬁbrin by enzymatic cleavage of the ﬁb - rinopeptides FpA and FpB by thrombin , initiating the polymeriza - tion reaction . ( B ) Reducing SDS - PAGE of rFib610 and pFib before and after addition of thrombin shows the main A a , B b and c chain bands . In addition , pFib contains bands corresponding to degraded A a chains ( ‘dA a ’ ) and to c ’ chains , conﬁrming its known molecular heterogeneity .

The A a - chain cDNA ( 629 residues ) , B b - chain cDNA ( 491 residues ) and c - chain cDNA ( 437 residues , isoform c A ) resulted in the pro - duction of mature A a , B b and c chains as found in circula - tion ( 610 , 461 and 411 residues , respectively ) . rFib610 was produced in PER . C6 (cid:1) cells using a fed - batch procedure in a stirred - tank reactor with CDM4PERMAb / PERMAab feed , as described previously for IgM [ 30 ] . During the expansion period , the culture supernatants were screened for ﬁbrinogen with intact A a chains [ 31 ] , with plasma - derived ﬁbrinogen ( pFib ) from Enzyme Research Laboratories ( ERL , Swansea , UK ) as reference . Recombinant ﬁbrinogen ( rFib610 ) was puriﬁed from the clariﬁed cell - culture medium using cationic and anionic column chromatography ( details are not dis - closed for proprietary reasons ) and was concentrated to 15 – 25 mg mL (cid:1) 1 in PBS by diaﬁltration [ 32 ] , with a typical yield of 0 . 3 – 0 . 4 g L (cid:1) 1 of cell culture supernatant . Both rFib610 and pFib were dialyzed into HBS buffer ( 20 m M HEPES , 150 m M NaCl , pH 7 . 4 ) against 100 9 sample vol - ume . The ﬁnal protein concentration was measured by spec - trophotometry and conﬁrmed by total protein measurements with a modiﬁed Biuret method using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay kit ( Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc , Landsmeer , the Nether - lands ) . Glycosylation and gel ﬁltration analyses reveal simi - lar extents of N - linked glycosylation and a small ( 6 – 9 % ) fraction of oligomers in rFib610 and pFib ( Figs . S1 , S2 ) . Fibrinogen molecular composition , ﬁbrin formation and cross - linking Fibrin clots were obtained by adding 1 U mL (cid:1) 1 human a - thrombin ( ERL ) to ﬁbrinogen in HBS buffer supple - mented with 2 m M CaCl 2 and incubating for 4 h at 37 ° C unless indicated otherwise . To access the response of ﬁbrin protoﬁbrils , we also assembled clots under ﬁne clot buffer conditions ( 50 m M Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 5 , 400 m M NaCl ) [ 33 ] in the presence of 3 . 2 m M CaCl 2 and 0 . 5 U mL (cid:1) 1 throm - bin at 37 ° C for 4 h . The molecular composition and degree of cross - linking of the samples were evaluated by sodium - dodecyl - sulfate polyacrylamide - gel - electrophoresis ( SDS - PAGE ) on 8 % gels . Cross - linked rFib610 clots were obtained by adding puriﬁed human FXIII zymogen ( ERL ) to the assembly solution containing thrombin and calcium . We used reversed - phase high - performance liquid chro - matography ( RP - HPLC ) to analyze ﬁbrinopeptide release upon thrombin activation [ 34 ] . Multi - scale structural characterization We characterized the network structure of ﬁbrin clots by imaging clots with a confocal laser scanning microscope ( Nikon Eclipse Ti , Amsterdam , the Netherlands ) using a 488 - nm laser ( Coherent Inc . , Utrecht , the Netherlands ) for illumination and photomultiplier tube detector . The clots were ﬂuorescently labeled by co - polymerizing ﬁbrinogen with 10 mole % Oregon - Green - 488 - labeled ﬁbrinogen ( Invitrogen , Bleiswijk , the Netherlands ) . Three - dimen - sional z - stack images were obtained with a 100 9 oil - immersion objective ( numerical aperture = 1 . 49 ) . The network structure was examined in higher resolution by scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ; Zeiss Supra 25 , Thornwood , NY , USA ; Fig . S3 ) . We characterized ﬁbrin ﬁber structure by turbidity measurements using a UV1 Spectrophotometer Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc ) . We computed the average diameter , d , and mass / length ratio , l , of the ﬁbers from the data using a theoretical model for light scattering from isotropic net - works of rigid rod - like particles [ 15 , 35 , 36 ] , with correction for wavelength dispersion [ 37 ] ( see Fig . S4 ) . The samples were polymerized for 4 h in humid 37 ° C conditions in cuvettes ( Plastibrand UV - cuvette micro , Sigma Aldrich , Zwijndrecht , the Netherlands ) with an optical path length of 1 cm . The early - stage kinetics of ﬁbrin polymerization was monitored using an Ultrospec 2100 Pro ( Amersham Biosciences , Valley Stream , NY , USA ) spectrophotome - ter . Comparative tests with colloidal samples and differ - ent optical path lengths conﬁrmed that multiple scattering was negligible in our measurements . The axial molecular packing order of the ﬁbrin ﬁbers was examined by small - angle X - ray scattering ( SAXS ) measurements at the DUBBLE beamline of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility ( ESRF , Grenoble , France ) on ﬁbrin samples polymerized in 2 - mm diameter glass capillaries ( Hilgenberg , Malsfeld , Germany ) . The incoming X - ray beam ( 12 keV ) was focused to a 300 9 350 - l m spot and scattering patterns were collected with 1 - min exposure at room temperature using a Pilatus 1M detector ( Dectris , Baden , Switzerland ) at a sample - to - detector distance of 2 . 8 m . The patterns were back - ground - corrected for the glass capillary and buffer and radially - averaged to obtain scattering curves of intensity I as a function of wavevector q . The q - range was calibrated using silver behenate powder as reference . Rheology Fibrin samples were polymerized in situ in the steel cone – plate geometry ( 40 mm diameter , 1 ° cone angle ) of a rheometer ( Physica MCR 501 ; Anton Paar , Graz , Aus - tria ) preheated to 37 ° C . The linear shear moduli of fully - formed clots were measured by applying 0 . 5 % oscillatory strain at a frequency of 0 . 5 Hz . To quantify the nonlinear response , we utilized differential measurements [ 38 ] : the sample was held at constant stress , s , and the differential strain response , dc , to a superposed stress oscillation of amplitude | ds | = 0 . 1 s was measured . To test the elastic limits of the samples , we performed ( i ) consecutive © 2017 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis 940 I . K . Piechocka et al differential measurements by iteratively increasing the pre - stress s to a maximum value s m and releasing it and ( ii ) consecutive creep tests by monitoring the strain , c , in response to a constant stress for 60 s followed by stress release . Results Compositional and structural characterization of rFib610 ﬁbrin We ﬁrst validate the homogeneous composition of rFib610 ﬁbrinogen using SDS - PAGE . As expected , we observe three bands corresponding to the A a ( 66 kDa ) , B b ( 52 kDa ) and c ( 47 kDa ) chains ( Fig . 1B ) . Addition of thrombin causes a slight shift of the A a - and B b - chain bands towards lower MW , indicating successful cleavage of FpA and FpB . A weak band also appears below the main a - chain band , indicating a small degree of proteolytic degradation [ 28 ] . There are no high MW bands , proving the absence of FXIII . In contrast , ﬁbrin prepared by thrombin activation of plasma ﬁbrinogen ( pFib ) displays clear high MW bands originating from covalently cross - linked a - chain polymers and c - dimers [ 39 , 40 ] and two minor bands that are absent in rFib610 . Next , we analyzed the ﬁbrinopeptides released from the ﬁbrinogen E - region using RP - HPLC . The HPLC proﬁle of rFib610 ( Fig . 1C , red trace ) shows the main FpA and FpB peaks at retention times of 38 and 55 min , respec - tively , and a minor FpB desArg peak eluting at 48 min . These peaks are identical to those found with pFib ( Fig . 1C , black trace ) [ 41 ] . However , rFib610 is free of the two FpAP and FpAY minor peaks commonly seen with pFib [ 34 ] . Thus , rFib610 possesses a high degree of molecular homogeneity , in contrast to the heterogeneity of pFib . Kinetic analysis of ﬁbrinopeptide release shows a fast release of FpA followed by slower release of FpB ( Fig . S5A ) , consistent with prior reports on plasma - derived ﬁbrinogen [ 42 , 43 ] . FpA release allows for the formation of double - stranded protoﬁbrils , followed by non - covalent protoﬁbril bundling into thicker ﬁbers facili - tated by a C connectors that dissociate from the ﬁbrinogen E - region upon release of FpB [ 44 , 45 ] . Indeed , upon thrombin addition the turbidity of rFib610 quickly rises ( Fig . S5B ) , reﬂecting the bundling of protoﬁbrils into thick ﬁbers that strongly scatter light . We then performed a multi - scale structural analysis of rFib610 clots over a range of concentrations , from 0 . 8 to 5 mg mL (cid:1) 1 , spanning the physiological levels of ﬁbrino - gen in plasma ( 2 – 4 mg mL (cid:1) 1 ) . At the network scale , con - focal microscopy and SEM show homogeneous , isotropic networks ( Figs . 2B , S3 ) . The average pore diameter determined from analysis of the confocal images mono - tonically decreases with increasing ﬁbrin concentration , from 4 . 7 (cid:3) 0 . 4 l m at 0 . 8 mg mL (cid:1) 1 to 1 . 5 (cid:3) 0 . 2 l m at 5 mg mL (cid:1) 1 ( Fig . S6 ) .

( B ) Confocal microscopy images , showing isotropic and homogeneous rFib610 networks at different ﬁbrin concentrations . The ﬁbers appear straight although they do experience thermal ﬂuctuations ( leading to entropic elasticity ) because the amplitude of the transverse bending ﬂuctuations is expected to be only ~ 26 nm , which cannot be resolved by diffraction - limited ﬂuorescent microscopy .

The peaks in the shaded ( gray ) region coincide with the expected third reﬂection of the half - staggered axial periodicity ( 22 . 5 nm ) of ﬁbrin ﬁbers , suggesting a similar axial packing arrangement in the three networks .

[ Color ﬁgure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary . com ] © 2017 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis Recombinant ﬁbrinogen and ﬁbrin clot mechanics 941 inverse - square - root dependence of pore size on concentra - tion if concentration only affects the ﬁber number density [ 46 ] , suggesting increased protoﬁbril lateral association with increasing ﬁbrin concentration , perhaps because of the changing thrombin / ﬁbrinogen ratio . This hypothesis is supported by turbidity measurements of the average ﬁber mass / length ratio , l ( Fig . 2E ) . Given a protoﬁbril l = 1 . 44 9 10 4 Da nm (cid:1) 1 [ 47 ] , the average number of protoﬁbrils within each ﬁber , N p , can be calculated to increase from 60 at 0 . 8 mg mL (cid:1) 1 to 95 at 5 mg mL (cid:1) 1 , accompanied by an increase of ﬁber diameter from 130 to 180 nm ( Fig . 2D ) . At the molecular scale , SAXS measure - ments show that rFib610 ﬁbers exhibit a peak at q ~ 0 . 85 nm (cid:1) 1 that corresponds to the third - order reﬂec - tion of the axial repeat distance of 22 . 5 nm ( Figs . 2A , C , S7 ) [ 2 ] . Thus , rFib610 ﬁbers possess the same half - stag - gered molecular packing order as pFib ﬁbers . Nonlinear rheology of uncross - linked rFib610 clots The purity of rFib610 preparation makes it an ideal model system to study the rheological behavior of ﬁbrin clots in the strict absence of FXIII - mediated cross - link - ing , providing a more stringent benchmark than that obtainable for plasma - derived ﬁbrinogen that requires FXIII removal [ 48 , 49 ] or inhibition [ 15 , 50 – 52 ] . We ﬁrst characterized the viscoelastic response of uncross - linked rFib610 clots at small deformations . The elastic modulus G 0 is nearly independent of frequency and the ratio between the viscous and elastic moduli , tan d = G ″ / G 0 , is much less than 1 for all ﬁbrin concentrations studied ( Fig . 3A ) . The linear modulus G 0 strongly increases with increasing ﬁbrin concentration , from 10 Pa at 0 . 8 mg mL (cid:1) 1 to 500 Pa at 5 mg mL (cid:1) 1 ( Fig . 3B ) , whereas tan d decreases from 0 . 10 to 0 . 02 , indicating suppression of viscous dissipation ( Fig . 3C ) . Thus rFib610 clots behave like elastic solids despite the absence of covalent cross - links . The non - covalent interactions responsible for ﬁbrin self - assembly , with measured binding energies of 20 – 50 k B T per molecule [ 11 , 45 , 53 – 55 ] , are therefore sufﬁ - cient to provide an elastic response at small deformations . To test the response of rFib610 clots to large deforma - tions , we applied increasing levels of shear stress and measured the change in the differential elastic , K 0 , and viscous , K ″ , moduli . Both moduli strongly increase as stress is ramped up ( Fig . 3D ) . This response is reversible up to strains of ~ 50 % , whereas beyond that the clots become softer with each repeated loading ( Fig . 3E ) . Moreover , the clots exhibit creep and incomplete strain recovery when stress is removed ( Fig . 3F ) . The non - cova - lent interactions are therefore not sufﬁciently strong to prevent irreversible ( viscoplastic ) changes at large defor - mations . This ﬁnding is consistent with conclusions from recent studies of plasma ﬁbrin clots , which showed that FXIII removal caused irreversible behavior at large stres - ses [ 49 , 52 ] . The effect of FXIII - mediated cross - linking The absence of FXIII in rFib610 is also ideal for testing how controllable levels of FXIII - mediated cross - linking ( Fig . 4A ) affect ﬁbrin rheology , providing a more precise approach than chemical - or antibody - mediated FXIII inhibition used in previous studies of plasma ﬁbrinogen [ 15 , 40 , 48 , 51 , 52 ] . SDS - PAGE analysis shows that when we add 5 l g mL (cid:1) 1 FXIII to 2 mg mL (cid:1) 1 rFib610 , the c chains fully dimerize , stabilizing the protoﬁbrils , whereas the a chains connecting adjacent protoﬁbrils are < 60 % cross - linked ( Fig . 4C – D ) . Increasing FXIII concentration leads to increasing multimerization of a chains until com - plete a - chain cross - linking with 20 l g mL (cid:1) 1 ( or 40 Loewy U mL (cid:1) 1 ) FXIII . Confocal and SEM imaging show no obvious effect of FXIII on rFib610 network structure ( Figs . 4B , S3 ) , consistent with recent reports on plasma ﬁbrin [ 15 , 48 ] . Indeed , turbidimetry reveals that cross - link - ing results in only a slight decrease of ﬁber diameter ( Fig . S8 ) . Rheology measurements show that FXIII - mediated cross - linking strongly enhances clot stiffness at small deformations : G 0 progressively increases from 90 Pa for 2 mg mL (cid:1) 1 uncross - linked rFib610 to 150 Pa at 5 l g mL (cid:1) 1 and 560 Pa at 20 l g mL (cid:1) 1 FXIII ( Fig . 4E ) . In contrast , viscous dissipation , as measured by tan d , immediately drops from 0 . 045 to 0 . 016 upon addition of 5 l g mL (cid:1) 1 FXIII and is not further reduced with higher FXIII ( Fig . 4F ) . These results suggest that viscous dissi - pation in ﬁbrin clots is mainly determined by c - chain cross - linking , which controls molecular connectivity within protoﬁbrils , whereas clot stiffness is determined by a combination of c - chain cross - linking within protoﬁbrils and multimeric a - chain cross - linking between protoﬁbrils , which acts at the ﬁber level . At large stresses , we ﬁnd similar strain - stiffening behav - ior in both cross - linked and uncross - linked rFib610 clots ( Fig . 4G ) . Strikingly , cross - linking leads to a completely reversible response up to ~ 200 % strains ( close to break - age ) in the presence of only 5 l g mL (cid:1) 1 FXIII , even though a - chain cross - linking is incomplete at this FXIII level . Moreover , cross - linking suppresses creep during stress application and incomplete strain recovery after stress removal ( Fig . S9 ) . Structural basis of ﬁbrin nonlinear rheology Both uncross - linked and cross - linked rFib610 clots show a triphasic strain - stiffening response ( Fig . 5A , B ) , similar to that observed for plasma ﬁbrin [ 50 , 56 ] . The ﬁrst ( linear ) regime corresponds to entropic elasticity associ - ated with the resistance of the ﬁbers to straighten out their thermal bending ﬂuctuations , as validated previously by optical tweezer microrheology [ 56 ] . This entropic regime vanishes when the ﬁbers are thicker or at high ﬁb - rin concentration [ 57 , 58 ] . Once the ﬁbers are straightened , © 2017 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis 942 I . K . Piechocka et al the network stiffness increases ( regime 2 ) until the stress is large enough to axially stretch the ﬁber backbone ( regime 3 ) . Prior studies on plasma ﬁbrin clots showed excellent agreement of the ﬁber mechanical properties inferred from the triphasic strain - stiffening response [ 50 , 56 , 57 ] and from light - scattering and single - ﬁber exper - iments [ 3 , 10 , 18 , 59 ] . Below we will use the same theoretical framework to interrogate rFib610 ﬁbrin mechanics . Fiber bending rigidity is typically quantiﬁed by the persistence length , which represents the length over which the ﬁlament deviates from a straight conforma - tion .

[ Color ﬁgure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary . com ] © 2017 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis Recombinant ﬁbrinogen and ﬁbrin clot mechanics 943 we can estimate its effective persistence length as l p N x p [ 60 ] . The factor x quantiﬁes the strength of coupling between the protoﬁbrils , which should depend on the extent of a - chain cross - linking between protoﬁbrils and vary between 1 for loose coupling and 2 for tight cou - pling . Entropic elasticity models predict that the linear modulus of the network ( regime 1 ) , G 0 , is directly related to l p and N p via [ 50 ] : G 0 ¼ 6 k B T q 11 = 5 l p N x p (cid:1) (cid:3) 7 = 5 ð 1 Þ Here k B T is the thermal energy and q = c / l denotes ﬁber contour length density , where c is ﬁbrin concentration . Knowing G 0 from rheology and N p from turbidimetry , we can therefore use Eq . ( 1 ) to infer the strength of protoﬁbril bundling within rFib610 ﬁbers , provided l p is known . We estimated l p by ﬁtting measured strain - stiffening curves for ﬁne ﬁbrin clots , which show suppressed protoﬁbril bund - ling ( Figs . S10 , S11 ) , to the theoretical prediction of entro - pic stiffening of semi - ﬂexible ﬁlament networks [ 56 ] ( Fig . S12 ) . Assuming N p = 2 ( based on turbidimetry data ) and x = 1 , as in plasma ﬁne clots [ 50 ] , we infer l p of rFib610 protoﬁbrils to be 75 nm . Using this l p value , we ﬁnd that x for ( bundled ) rFib610 clots varies between 1 . 90 (cid:3) 0 . 22 in the absence of FXIII and 2 . 25 (cid:3) 0 . 15 with 20 l g mL (cid:1) 1 FXIII ( Fig . 5C ) . The latter value exceeds the tight coupling limit ( x = 2 ) , probably because of the uncertainty in l p , as electron microscopy imaging shows that N p varies between 1 and 2 within the network ( Fig . S11 ) . Similar analysis assuming other l p estimates consistently yields a similar trend of increasing x with increasing FXIII concentration ( Fig . S13 ) . FXIII - mediated a - chain cross - linking therefore increases clot stiffness by strengthening protoﬁbril associa - tions and stiffening the ﬁbers . To extract the force – extension behavior of the ﬁbers , we consider the strain - stiffening behavior in regime 3 and rescale the stress - stiffening curves by the protoﬁbril length density , N p q . The curves for uncross - linked and cross - linked rFib610 clots overlap in regime 3 ( Fig . 5F , blue symbols ) , indicating that the protoﬁbrils contribute inde - pendently to network elasticity . The scaled curves initially show a plateau , from which we can infer the linear stretch rigidity of the protoﬁbrils ( Table 1 ) , followed by a strain - stiffening regime ( Fig . 5B ) . The ﬁbers themselves apparently stiffen when they are sufﬁciently stretched , consistent with AFM studies on single plasma ﬁbrin ﬁbers that demonstrated strain - stiffening above strains of 100 % [ 10 , 61 ] . Interestingly , cross - linked rFib610 ﬁbers show more pronounced stiffening ( ~ 2 - fold larger slope ) than their uncross - linked counterparts once the average force per protoﬁbril s / ( N p q ) exceeds ~ 1 pN , suggesting that cross - linking changes the force – extension behavior of the ﬁbers . To distinguish the roles of c - and a - chain cross - linking in this ﬁber stiffening , we analyzed the nonlinear behavior of rFib610 ﬁne clots where cross - linking occurs primarily through c - chains ( Fig . S10 ) . Clots of cross - linked rFib610 protoﬁbrils stiffen in a similar manner to bundled rFib610 clots ( Fig . 5D – E , triangles ) .

Piechocka et al until the average force per protoﬁbril reaches ~ 4 pN ( Fig . 5F ) . This is in contrast to both cross - linked protoﬁbrils and ﬁbers , which already stiffen at ~ 1 pN . From the network stiffness at this plateau , we estimate the stretch modulus of the protoﬁbrils to be ~ 100 pN , similar to previously reported values of 50 – 100 pN for ﬁsh ﬁbrin protoﬁbrils [ 3 ] . We ﬁnally test the role of molecular composition in protoﬁbril mechanics by comparing ﬁne rFib610 clots with their pFib counterparts . At low stress , ﬁne rFib610 clots are always stiffer than ﬁne pFib , regardless of cross - link - ing ( Fig . S14 ) . Using the polymer elasticity model explained above , we infer that rFib610 protoﬁbrils have a 25 % larger bending rigidity than pFib protoﬁbrils ( Table 1 and Fig . S15 ) . Moreover , cross - linking increases the stretch modulus of rFib610 protoﬁbrils by 50 % ( Table 1 ) , whereas it does not affect the stretch modulus of pFib protoﬁbrils [ 50 ] . Thus , molecular heterogeneity directly affects the mechanical properties of ﬁbrin protoﬁbrils . 10 3 10 4 Regime 2 Regime 3 rFib610 + FXIII [ FXIII ] ( µg mL – 1 ) rFib610 rFib610 + FXIII rFib610 Regime 2 Regime 3 10 2 10 1 2 . 0 tight loose 1 . 5 1 . 0 0 5 10 20 1 2 0 . 1 1 10 100 3 ( % ) γ χ K ′ ( P a ) 10 3 10 4 fine rFib610 + FXIII fine rFib610 fine rFib610 + FXIII fine rFib610 10 2 10 1 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 – 1 1 2 1 10 100 3 ( % ) γ K ′ ( P a ) K ′ / ( N p ) ( p N ) ρ / ( Np ) ( pN ) ρ 10 – 1 10 – 2 10 – 3 10 0 10 1 10 2 τ A D B E C F onset of protofibril stiffening Fig . 5 .

[ Color ﬁgure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary . com ] © 2017 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis Recombinant ﬁbrinogen and ﬁbrin clot mechanics 945 Discussion Understanding the molecular basis of ﬁbrin elasticity is a long - standing challenge that is difﬁcult to address because of ﬁbrin’s multi - scale structure and molecular heterogene - ity . We here show that recombinant ﬁbrinogen provides an ideal model system to systematically probe the role of molecular composition and plasma factors in clot mechanics . Our results show that the viscoelasticity of ﬁbrin clots is determined by intermolecular cross - links both within and between protoﬁbrils . At low strain , the inﬂuence of a - chain cross - linking on the stiffness of ﬁbrin clots [ 15 , 17 , 62 ] and ﬁbers [ 10 , 18 , 61 ] can be explained by strengthening of protoﬁbril association within each ﬁber . At high strain , where the network response is dominated by the force – extension behavior of individual ﬁbers , we observe nonlinearity regardless of protoﬁbril bundling , suggesting a much more limited role of a - chain cross - link - ing in ﬁber stretching . Because the protoﬁbrils are stretched independently at high axial loads [ 63 ] , forced unfolding of the constituent monomers is likely to be the main source of the intrinsic nonlinearity of protoﬁbril ( and ﬁber ) stretching [ 8 , 64 ] . Interestingly , protoﬁbrils have been proposed to undergo hyperbranching within ﬁbers [ 65 ] , which may potentially modify the ﬁber force – extension response . Further investigation into the sec - ondary structure and monomer packing within strained ﬁbers is necessary to precisely resolve this regime . Our results also indicate that c - chain cross - linking con - tributes to clot viscoelasticity by rendering the network response more reversible and by directly changing the force – extension behavior of protoﬁbrils . These ﬁndings signiﬁcantly expand our understanding of the elusive role of c - chain cross - linking in ﬁbrin mechanics [ 17 , 51 , 62 , 66 ] . The structural origin of the reduced onset force for stretch - stiffening from 4 to 1 pN for uncross - linked rFib610 protoﬁbrils remains unknown . This force level is much lower than the critical forces required to unfold ﬁb - rinogen’s coiled - coil region ( 125 pN ) or c nodule ( 74 pN ) , but could be related to entropic stretching of a C connectors [ 9 ] , suggesting an entropic origin of protoﬁbril strain - stiffening . Subtle changes in intermolecular connec - tivity , for instance as a result of hyperbranching [ 65 ] , may potentially shift the onset of unfolding of the different domains of ﬁbrin molecules within the protoﬁbrils . Our data therefore establish that c - chain and a - chain cross - linking have distinct effects on the linear viscoelasticity of ﬁbrin clots as well as the strain - stiffening response at the network , ﬁber and protoﬁbril levels . Despite the difference in molecular composition and probably also in post - translational modiﬁcations , rFib610 displays similar early kinetics of thrombin - mediated ﬁb - rinopeptide release , protoﬁbril formation and bundling as pFib , resulting in a similar clot and ﬁber structure . How - ever , the nonlinear rheological response of uncross - linked rFib610 protoﬁbrils shows a larger bending rigidity and an extended linear response compared with pFib protoﬁb - rils . These observations suggest that molecular composi - tion inﬂuences ﬁber and network mechanics by modulating properties at the protoﬁbril scale . At the ﬁber level , changes in molecular composition can potentially inﬂuence the lateral packing of protoﬁbrils within the ﬁbers , which has been recently linked to ﬁbrin ﬁber stiff - ness [ 67 ] and cell mechanosensing [ 68 ] . It will be interest - ing to probe the effect of molecular and structural heterogeneity on protoﬁbril and ﬁber stiffness directly by AFM - based nanoindentation and pulling [ 10 , 61 ] . These experiments can also help in independently quantifying protoﬁbril persistence length . Here we report l p = 75 nm , which is smaller than l p values predicted by modeling protoﬁbrils as homogeneous elastic rods [ 3 , 65 , 69 ] . How - ever , recent atomistic molecular dynamics simulations point to the existence of hinge points within ﬁbrinogen coiled - coil regions [ 70 ] and in the D : D interface between ﬁbrin monomers within single - stranded oligomers [ 71 ] that may make protoﬁbrils more ﬂexible than anticipated . Our study underlines the importance of understanding how , during coagulation , different ﬁbrinogen variants co - assemble into protoﬁbrils and ﬁbers and how FXIII - mediated cross - linking contributes to clot mechanics at different levels of mechanical stress .
