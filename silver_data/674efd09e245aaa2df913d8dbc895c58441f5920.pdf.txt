4129 Summary Sox transcription factors play widespread roles during development ; however , their versatile functions have a relatively simple basis : the binding of a Sox protein alone to DNA does not elicit transcriptional activation or repression , but requires binding of a partner transcription factor to an adjacent site on the DNA . Thus , the activity of a Sox protein is dependent upon the identity of its partner factor and the context of the DNA sequence to which it binds . In this Primer , we provide an mechanistic overview of how Sox family proteins function , as a paradigm for transcriptional regulation of development involving multi - transcription factor complexes , and we discuss how Sox factors can thus regulate diverse processes during development . Key words : HMG domain , Partner factors , Transcriptional regulation , Stem cells , Cell lineage specification Introduction An emerging view of transcriptional regulation in developmental processes is that transcription factor complexes , rather than single transcription factors , play a major role ( Reményi et al . , 2004 ; Verger and Duterque - Coquillaud , 2002 ) . This idea has been pioneered , most rigorously tested and studied in a variety of developmental contexts in the case of Sox ( SRY - related HMG - box ) family proteins . Sox family proteins are a conserved group of transcriptional regulators ( see Box 1 ) defined by the presence of a highly conserved high - mobility group ( HMG ) domain that mediates DNA binding . This domain was first identified in Sry , a crucial factor involved in mammalian male sex determination ( Gubbay et al . , 1990 ; Sinclair et al . , 1990 ) . Multiple other Sox proteins have subsequently been identified and analysed . Vertebrate genomes contain ~ 20 Sox family members with highly divergent developmental functions , as was indicated by the initial analyses of Sox expression in embryos ( Collignon et al . , 1996 ; Uwanogho et al . , 1995 ) . Although Sox proteins are also conserved in invertebrate lineages and exert analogous regulatory functions ( Phochanukul and Russell , 2010 ) , we here confine our discussion to the vertebrate Sox family members . In this Primer , we first outline the structure and molecular activities of Sox proteins , before discussing their roles during vertebrate development . In particular , the action and function of Sox proteins will be overviewed as a paradigm for transcriptional regulation mediated by a family of transcription factors . Sox protein structure Sox proteins can bind to ATTGTT or related sequence motifs through their HMG domain , which consists of three α helices ( Badis et al . , 2009 ; Kondoh and Kamachi , 2010 ) . This binding is established by the interaction of the HMG domain with the minor groove of the DNA , which widens the minor groove and causes DNA to bend towards the major groove ( Reményi et al . , 2003 ) . It is speculated that DNA bending itself may contribute to the regulatory functions of Sox proteins ( Pevny and Lovell - Badge , 1997 ) , but this has not been proved experimentally . Sox proteins are classified into groups A - H , depending on the amino acid sequence of the HMG domain ( Fig . 1A ) . Outside the HMG domain , strong homology , with regards to amino acid sequence and the overall organization of protein domains , is found only within a group ( Bowles et al . , 2000 ; Schepers et al . , 2002 ) ( Fig . 1B ) ( see also Box 1 ) . The SoxA group contains only Sry , which is encoded in mammalian Y chromosomes . Although the HMG box of Sry is highly conserved between species , sequences outside this domain are highly divergent among mammalian species ( Sekido , 2010 ) . The SoxB group is split into two sub - groups . SoxB1 comprises Sox1 , Sox2 and Sox3 ; fish species also possess Sox19 . These family members have short N - terminal sequences followed by the HMG Development 140 , 4129 - 4144 ( 2013 ) doi : 10 . 1242 / dev . 091793 © 2013 .

The evolution of Sox genes Sox ( SRY - related HMG - box ) genes encoding the Sox proteins are conserved throughout the animal kingdom . The genes for Sox / Tcf type high - mobility group ( HMG ) domain transcription factors are already present in unicellular choanoflagellates , the animals most closely related to multicellular metazoans , although Hox and other segmentation - related transcription factor genes are absent , indicating an ancient origin of Sox factors ( King et al . , 2008 ) . True Sox factors became distinguished in the most primitive metazoan Trichoplax ( Srivastava et al . , 2008 ) . Even in invertebrates , Sox genes can be classified into B , C , D , E and F groups ( Phochanukul and Russell , 2010 ) . Sry ( group A ) is unique to mammalian Y chromosomes and is assumed to have been derived from Sox3 ( group B1 ) ( Foster and Graves , 1994 ) , which is encoded on the X chromosome . The presence of multiple Sox genes in most Sox groups in vertebrates is a consequence of multiple rounds of genome duplication , which began in primitive chordates . Fish genomes have experienced three rounds of duplications , as opposed to two rounds in other higher vertebrates . This has resulted in frequent duplicated Sox genes , which are exemplified by Sox1a and Sox1b ( Kamachi et al . , 2009 ; Okuda et al . , 2006 ) . The functional redundancy within a group of Sox genes allows individual protein members of the group to change their amino acid sequence and hence their function over evolutionary time . In mammals , Sox15 is a singlet group G Sox , which was derived from an ancestor of Sox19 ( group B1 ) during vertebrate evolution , as indicated by its conserved synteny ( Kamachi et al . , 2009 ; Okuda et al . , 2006 ) . Other taxon - restricted Sox genes appear to have arisen analogously , e . g . SoxH ( Sox30 ) from SoxD , as evidenced by the presence of remnant of coiled - coil domain sequence ( Fig . 1C ) , or by tandem duplication of a genomic segment , e . g . Sox32 in fish from duplicated Sox17 ( Kobayashi et al . , 2006 ) . D E V E L O P M E N T 4130 domain and long C - terminal sequences after the HMG domain . The C - terminal sequence includes a domain assigned as a transcriptional activation domain , based on an assay using fusion to heterologous DNA - binding domains , as detailed below ( Kamachi et al . , 1998 ) . SoxB2 proteins , which comprise Sox14 and Sox21 , not only have an HMG domain similar to SoxB1 proteins , but also share a short basic amino acid sequence , known as ‘B homology’ , with them . Unlike Sox B1 proteins , however , SoxB2 proteins have a repression domain in the C - terminal sequence ( Uchikawa et al . , 1999 ) . SoxC , SoxE and SoxF groups have protein organizations that are analogous to SoxB1 proteins , i . e . a total length of 300 - 500 amino acids with HMG domains located close to the N terminus and an activation domain in the C - terminal region . However , the amino acid sequences outside the HMG domain are unique to individual groups . SoxC comprises Sox4 , Sox11 and Sox12 ( Dy et al . , 2008 ) ; SoxE comprises Sox8 , Sox9 and Sox10 ( Stolt and Wegner , 2010 ) ; and SoxF comprises Sox7 , Sox17 and Sox18 ( Francois et al . , 2010 ) . SoxE proteins also contain a self - dimerization domain on PRIMER Development 140 ( 20 ) SrySox1Sox2Sox3Sox14Sox21Sox15Sox4Sox11 Sox12Sox7Sox17Sox18Sox8Sox9Sox10Sox5Sox6Sox13Sox30 Conservation Sequence logo 20 40 60 A B1 B2 G C F E D H DNA - binding HMG domain Transcriptional activation domain Dimerization domain Transcriptional repression domain Coiled - coil domain or its remnant Sry A Sox2 B1 Sox14 B2 Sox15 G Sox11 C Sox18 F Sox9 E Sox5 D Sox30 H A B 395 aa 319 aa 240 aa 231 aa 395 aa 377 aa 507 aa 763 aa 782 aa Group B homology C Sox10 Sox8Sox9 Sox18 Sox7Sox17 Sox12Sox4Sox11 Sox15 Sox3Sox1Sox2Sox14Sox21 Sox30 Sox6Sox5 Sox13 Sry Lef1Tcf7 Hmgb1 B1 B2 G E F C A D H c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c ccc cc c ccc cc 100 % 0 % Key Fig . 1 .

The SoxD group , which comprises Sox5 , Sox6 and Sox13 , is unique because SoxD proteins have a long N - terminal sequence containing a coiled - coil domain that allows dimerization with other SoxD proteins ( Lefebvre , 2010 ) . Finally , mammal - specific SoxG ( Sox15 ) ( Meeson et al . , 2007 ) and SoxH ( Sox30 ) ( Osaki et al . , 1999 ) proteins are structurally related to SoxB1 and SoxD proteins , respectively ( see Box 1 ) . The regulation of Sox protein expression and activity Sox activity can be regulated at multiple levels . As discussed in detail below , Sox proteins function together with partner factors to elicit their action . However , the expression of Sox genes themselves is frequently subject to auto - regulation or control by other Sox proteins . Sox expression is also regulated post - transcriptionally by miRNAs ( Peng et al . , 2012 ; Xu et al . , 2009b ) ( see Box 2 ) . Sox protein function is known to be dose - dependent ( Pevny and Nicolis , 2010 ) , so modulating Sox protein levels is an important mode of regulation . In addition , Sox protein activity in a cell is modulated by covalent modification or by interaction with various proteins . Notably , Sox - dependent regulations intersect with signalling systems such as the sonic hedgehog ( Shh ) and Wnt signalling pathways , in which Sox - Gli and Sox - β - catenin interactions , respectively , are implicated ( Bernard and Harley , 2010 ; Leung et al . , 2011 ; Malki et al . , 2010 ; Oosterveen et al . , 2012 ; Peterson et al . , 2012 ) . Various post - translational modifications have also been reported to modulate the activity , stability and intracellular localization of Sox2 , Sox9 and other Sox proteins . For example , studies on cultured cells have shown that Sox2 is subject to various covalent modifications such as phosphorylation ( Jeong et al . , 2010 ; Van Hoof et al . , 2009 ) , sumoylation ( Tsuruzoe et al . , 2006 ) , acetylation ( Baltus et al . , 2009 ) , methylation ( Zhao et al . , 2011 ) and glycosylation ( Jang et al . , 2012 ) ( Fig . 2 ) , although the biological significance of these modifications during embryogenesis remains to be confirmed . Interestingly , the regions in which Sox2 post - translational modifications can occur are located within two short amino acid stretches : one in the HMG domain and the other in the C - terminal domain , which suggests that these modifications may compete or cooperate with each other . For example , Sox2 is phosphorylated in two regions . Phosphorylation of a threonine in the HMG domain by Akt kinases enhances protein stability by inhibiting ubiquitin - mediated proteolysis ( Jeong et al . , 2010 ) , whereas phosphorylation of serine residues in the C - terminal domain leads to phosphorylation - dependent sumoylation of the adjacent lysine residue ( Van Hoof et al . , 2009 ) . Acetylation can also regulate Sox protein activity . Acetylation by p300 of a lysine residue close to the nuclear localization signal of Sry , and of one in the nuclear export signal region of Sox2 , promotes nuclear import and nuclear export , respectively ( Baltus et al . , 2009 ; Thevenet et al . , 2004 ) . Because these two sites are highly conserved , these acetylation reactions may finely tune the subcellular localization of a broad range of Sox proteins . In a few cases , the impact of Sox protein modifications has been demonstrated in developing embryos . Sry and Sox9 are phosphorylated by protein kinase A ( PKA ) , which enhances their DNA - binding activity ( Malki et al . , 2010 ) . This phosphorylation of Sox9 also leads to its translocation into the nucleus in cells of the testis ( Malki et al . , 2010 ) , and is essential in neural crest ( NC ) cells for the Sox9 - Snail interaction that promotes NC delamination ( Liu et al . , 2013 ) . The functional relevance of sumoylation has been best demonstrated for SoxE proteins in NC development . SoxE sumoylation inhibits NC development , causing loss of pigmentation ( Taylor and Labonne , 2005 ) . Sumoylated SoxE Box 2 . Modulation of Sox protein expression levels by microRNAs Sox ( SRY - related HMG - box ) protein expression levels are modulated post - transcriptionally by microRNAs ( miRNAs , miRs ) , which repress the translation and / or promote the degradation of their target mRNAs . Several examples of such regulation are detailed below . miR - 145 expression is highly upregulated during the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells ( ESCs ) . miR - 145 directly targets 3 (cid:2) UTRs ( untranslated regions ) of the mRNAs of Sox2 and other ‘core pluripotency factors’ , and promotes differentiation into mesoderm and ectoderm lineages ( Xu et al . , 2009b ) . miR - 200 family members are expressed at high levels in mouse ESCs and neural stem / progenitor cells . Sox2 is directly targeted by miR - 200c , whereas Sox2 trans - activates the promoter of the miR - 200c / 141 gene , thereby forming a negative - feedback loop ( Peng et al . , 2012 ) . This miR - 200 - mediated negative regulation may lead to gradual reduction in Sox2 levels during neural differentiation . During oligodendrocyte development in the CNS , SoxD proteins ( Sox5 / 6 ) are expressed in precursor cells and repress oligodendrocyte differentiation , whereas SoxE proteins ( Sox9 / 10 ) promote oligodendrocyte differentiation ( Stolt et al . , 2006 ) . miR - 219 , the expression of which is induced when oligodendrocytes differentiate , directly represses Sox6 expression , which enables the rapid transition of proliferating oligodendrocyte precursors to oligodendrocyte myelination ( Dugas et al . , 2010 ; Zhao et al . , 2010 ) . miR - 124 - mediated Sox9 repression is reported to be important for neurogenesis in the adult mammalian brain ( Cheng et al . , 2009 ) . miR - 124 is expressed at low levels in stem cell astrocytes and transit amplifying cells , whereas it is upregulated in neuroblasts in the subventricular niche and represses Sox9 expression , permitting neuronal differentiation .

Post - translational modification of Sox2 . Post - translational modification sites of Sox2 ( SRY - related HMG - box 2 ) are shown with their functional effects . Data obtained from studies of human and mouse Sox2 are combined on the mouse amino acid sequence . The nuclear export signal ( NES , blue ) , nuclear localization signal ( NLS , purple ) and Group B homology region ( striped red ) are highlighted . D E V E L O P M E N T 4132 proteins fail to interact with the co - activators CREB - binding protein ( CBP ) / p300 , and instead recruit the Grg4 co - repressor ( Tle4 , transducin - like enhancer of split 4 ) , which leads to strong inhibition of SoxE target genes ( Lee et al . , 2012 ) . By contrast , it is interesting to note that sumoylated SoxE promotes the development of non - sensory cranial placodes ( Taylor and Labonne , 2005 ) . Mechanism of action : Sox proteins complex with partner factors An important characteristic of Sox proteins is that they generally exhibit their gene regulatory functions only by forming complexes with partner transcription factors ( Kamachi et al . , 2000 ; Kondoh and Kamachi , 2010 ) . Thus , a functional Sox - binding site is accompanied by a binding site for a second partner protein , which is required for Sox - dependent transcriptional regulation , and the binding of a single Sox protein alone to a DNA site does not lead to transcriptional activation or repression ( e . g . Kamachi et al . , 2001 ; Yuan et al . , 1995 ) ( Fig . 3A ) . As Sox proteins in many cases interact with the partner factors in the absence of DNA , it is presumed that the Sox - partner complexes can form first and then recognize target DNA sites as a complex ( Fig . 3A ) . For SoxB1 / C / F proteins , their partner factors are heterologous transcription factors belonging to protein families such as the Pou and Pax families . SoxE proteins , by contrast , exhibit two modes of partner interactions : one that employs heterologous partners and another that requires homologous dimerization . SoxD proteins also dimerize via their coiled - coil dimerization motif . Partner factors for SoxH have not yet been determined . Classic examples of the regulatory targets of Sox - partner complexes are the Fgf4 ( fibroblast growth factor 4 ) enhancer , which is activated by Sox2 and Pou5f1 / Oct4 ( POU domain , class 5 , transcription factor 1 ) in embryonic stem cells ( ESCs ) ( Ambrosetti et al . , 1997 ; Yuan et al . , 1995 ) , and the δ - crystallin DC5 enhancer , which is activated by Sox2 and Pax6 ( paired box gene 6 ) during lens development ( Kamachi et al . , 1995 ; Kamachi et al . , 2001 ) . In both cases , the enhancers are activated by the co - binding of Sox2 and a partner factor , and mutations in the binding site for either Sox2 or the co - factor inactivate the enhancer . The binding site sequences of the Sox2 - partner complexes are not simply the sum of the consensus binding sequences that are determined using single factors ( Fig . 3B , C ) . For example , the replacement of the Pax6 - binding site within the DC5 sequence bound by the Sox2 - Pax6 complex with the Pax6 consensus binding sequence inactivates the enhancer ( Kamachi et al . , 2001 ) . Similarly , the sequences bound by Sox9 dimers found in the enhancers of genes associated with chondrocyte development , e . g . those for collagens , deviate considerably from the Sox consensus binding PRIMER Development 140 ( 20 ) Sox Sox Partner Partner No action No action Transcriptionalactivation , etc .

Sox partner interactions . Sox ( SRY - related HMG - box ) proteins function by forming complexes with partner proteins and via binding to DNA sequences , which differ from the sum of binding consensus . ( A ) Schematic representation showing DNA binding and the functions of Sox - partner complexes . ( B ) Examples of in vivo binding sequences for the Sox2 - Pou5f1 / Oct4 complex , which were identified in the enhancers of the genes indicated . The Sox2 binding sequences approximately conform to the consensus , ( C / T ) [ A / T ] TTGT ( T ) ( the sequences in parentheses are not strong requirements ) ( Badis et al . , 2009 ) , whereas the Pou5f1 / Oct4 - binding sequences deviate from the consensus ATGCAAAT at a few base positions . This deviation from the consensus is important for discriminating them from other Sox2 - Pou protein complexes ; Sox2 - Pou3f1 / 2 complexes fail to interact with some of Sox2 - Pou5f1 binding sequences ( as indicated on the right ) . Original data : Fgf4 ( Wiebe et al . , 2003 ) , Sox2 ( Tomioka et al . , 2002 ) , Utf1 ( Nishimoto et al . , 1999 ) , nestin ( Nes ) ( Tanaka et al . , 2004 ) . Two different arrangements of Sox2 - and Pou5f1 - binding sequences have been recognized . ( C ) Functional binding sequences of Sox2 - Pax6 complexes , which were identified in the enhancers indicated . The Sox2 - binding sequences conform to the consensus , whereas the Pax6 - binding sequences differ considerably from the Pax6 - binding consensus TTCACGC [ A / T ] T [ G / C ] A - T [ G / T ] [ A / C ] AC in either orientation . This deviation from the consensus is important for transcriptional activation by the Sox2 - Pax6 protein complex : replacement of the Pax6 - binding site sequence in the δ - crystallin enhancer with the Pax6 consensus binding sequence inactivates the enhancer ( Kamachi et al . , 2001 ) . ( D ) Sox9 homodimer - binding sequences found in the enhancers of collagen and the related genes indicated . In contrast to the heterodimers , the Sox9 dimer - binding sequences deviate from the Sox consensus in both sites ( Bernard et al . , 2003 ; Bridgewater et al . , 2003 ; Dy et al . , 2012 ; Han and Lefebvre , 2008 ; Sock et al . , 2003 ) .

Evidence indicates that a complex of a Sox and its partner factor assumes a specific conformation to elicit transcriptional regulation upon binding to its unique target sequences ( Kamachi et al . , 2001 ) . Whether a Sox - partner complex elicits transcriptional activation or repression depends on whether the complex recruits co - activator or repressor . Indeed , recent proteomics analysis identified Trrap co - activator ( transformation / transcription domain - associated protein ) , NcoR / SMRT co - repressors ( Ncor1 / 2 , nuclear receptor co - repressors 1 / 2 ) and NuRD co - repressor complexes as strongly interacting co - factors of Sox2 ( Engelen et al . , 2011 ) , suggesting that Sox2 can participate in transcriptional activation or repression depending on the co - factor recruited by the Sox2 - partner factor complex . A popular way of characterizing the transactivation / repression potential of a transcription factor is to excise regions of its non - DNA - binding domains and fuse them to the DNA - binding domain of another protein , such as that of the GAL4 protein , which binds to DNA as a dimer . If the resulting fusion protein can recruit co - activators in this context , it will activate a reporter gene , and the protein region is registered as an ‘activation domain’ that can recruit a co - activator under a certain molecular context . A ‘repression domain’ that can recruit a co - repressor is determined analogously . The various domains of Sox proteins indicated in Fig . 1 have been determined in this fashion . For example , SoxB1 proteins harbouring an activation domain participate in the transactivation process , e . g . those occurring in the Fgf4 and δ - crystallin enhancers ( Ambrosetti et al . , 1997 ; Kamachi et al . , 2001 ; Yuan et al . , 1995 ) , whereas SoxB2 proteins with a repression domain participate in transrepression processes ( Bylund et al . , 2003 ; Uchikawa et al . , 1999 ) . However , it is important to emphasize that these DNA - binding domain fusion assays do not represent the full repertoire of the regulatory potential of a transcription factor or a Sox - partner complex . For example , the interaction of Sox2 with co - repressor ( Engelen et al . , 2011 ) was not indicated by using the fusion assay ( Kamachi et al . , 1999 ; Kamachi et al . , 1998 ) . Moreover , although SoxD proteins do not possess an activation / repression domain based on the DNA - binding domain fusion assay , Sox6 is known to interact with the co - repressor CtBP ( C - terminal binding protein ) and to repress Fgf3 expression during inner ear development ( Murakami et al . , 2001 ) . It has also been demonstrated that Sox9 has both activation and repression modes , depending on the target site ( and hence the partner factor ) , and in the repression mode Sox9 recruits Gli proteins as the partner factor ( Leung et al . , 2011 ) . Furthermore , Sox9 interacts with Runx2 ( runt related transcription factor 2 ) and inhibits Runx2 - dependent transactivation of osteoblast - specific genes ( Zhou et al . , 2006 ) . Therefore , the transcriptional regulatory activity of a Sox - partner complex needs to be assessed in individual contexts of the cells and target DNAs . Sox - partner exchange allows stepwise progression of developmental processes Some Sox - partner complexes can activate the expression of their own respective genes , which stabilizes the cell state ( Kondoh and Kamachi , 2010 ; Kondoh et al . , 2004 ) , as seen in the case of Sox2 and Pou5f1 / Oct4 ( Fig . 4A ) However , the replacement of either component of the complex can result in large - scale changes in target genes , which in turn can contribute to developmental progression . Two representative cases of Sox - dependent developmental regulation are discussed below . In the first case , a Sox - partner pair activates the gene for another transcription factor , which then functions as a new Sox partner ( Fig . 4B ) . For example , during melanocyte development from the NC , a Sox10 - Pax3 pair activates expression of the transcription factor Mitf ( microphthalmia - associated transcription factor ) , which then acts as a Sox10 partner to activate the Dct ( dopachrome tautomerase ) and Tyr ( tyrosinase ) genes involved in melanocyte differentiation ( Bondurand et al . , 2000 ; Ludwig et al . , 2004 ; Murisier et al . , 2007 ) . In the second case , a Sox factor changes while the same partner factor is shared , as exemplified by the Sry - Sox9 switch during gonadal development ( Fig . 4C ) . Another example of such a developmental switch is seen during neural tube development ( Fig . 5A ) . In embryonic neural tubes , neural progenitor cells in the ventricular zone express SoxB1 proteins , while the postmitotic neuronal precursors in subventricular zone express SoxC proteins ( Bergsland et al . , 2011 ; Tanaka et al . , 2004 ; Uwanogho et al . , 1995 ) .

Paradigms of developmental regulation by Sox - partner complexes . ( A ) Sox - partner complexes can activate cell - specific genes and their own genes , thereby stabilizing the cell state . Sox2 - Pou5f1 / Oct4 in ESCs is shown . Sox2 - and Pax6 - dependent lens cell development ( not shown ) is also reliant on Sox2 - Pax6 co - regulatory loops . ( B ) Sox - partner complexes can also activate the gene for the partner protein required during the next developmental step , thereby promoting a domino - like progression of the developmental process . Sox10 - Pax3 interactions , which then activate Mitf expression and Sox10 - Mitf complex formation , during melanocyte development from the neural crest are shown . Schwann cell development ( not shown ) is also a representative of this paradigm , as discussed in the main text . ( C ) Sox - partner complexes can activate a second Sox gene that acts in the following step employing the same partner factor , thereby promoting the developmental process . The case of Sox9 induction by Sry - Sf1 during male gonad development is shown . ( D ) ‘Sox trio’ cases . Although Sox9 often employs itself as its own partner and dimerizes , Sox9 dimers further require SoxD ( Sox5 / 6 ) dimers that bind to nearby DNA sites for their activity in many occasions of chondrocyte development . An example of Acan enhancer regulation is shown . The nature of Sox9 - Sox5 / 6 interaction has not been clarified .

D E V E L O P M E N T 4134 underlying this SoxB1 - SoxC switch has not been characterized . SoxB1 and SoxC proteins both form complexes with Pou3f factors ( e . g . Pou3f2 / Brn2 ) , which are expressed and nuclear localized in the ventricular and subventricular zones . The switching of Sox expression changes the gene expression profile of the cells from the SoxB1 - Pou3f target group to the SoxC - Pou3f target group . These sets of target genes show some overlap , e . g . Nes ( nestin ) ( Tanaka et al . , 2004 ) , resulting in graded , rather than abrupt , changes between cells . Developmental functions of Sox group proteins The aforementioned modes of Sox protein - dependent regulation are found in various developmental processes , and there are strong associations between individual Sox groups and specific cell lineages . It is often observed that the members of the same Sox group , sharing equivalent functions , are expressed in the same developing tissues ( e . g . SoxB1 proteins in the CNS , SoxE proteins in the NC and SoxF proteins in the vascular system ) , although their precise spatial and temporal tissue expression patterns differ slightly . This situation creates functional redundancy between the group members that co - regulate the same targets , which safeguards the developmental processes against genetic variations between individual animals . However , the contribution of individual members of a Sox group to a developmental process is not always equivalent , with regard to the timing of expression , expression levels and the activity of a protein , as exemplified by the more minor contribution by Sox8 among SoxE proteins in the development of NC - derived tissues ( Kellerer et al . , 2006 ; Stolt et al . , 2005 ) . Documented cases of Sox - dependent gene regulation in various developmental contexts are listed in Table 1 , highlighting Sox - partner interactions . It is interesting that the members of the same Sox group tend to interact with the same partner factor . even in different lineages , e . g . Sox10 - Mef2c in NC versus Sox9 - Mef2c in chondrogenesis . Mutant and tissue - specific knockout mouse phenotypes , as well as the congenital disorders in humans associated with Sox protein function , are also indicated . Representative cases of cell lineage - specific regulation by particular Sox groups are summarized below . The Sox2 - Pou5f1 / Oct4 complex in embryonic stem cells and the epiblast Many ESC - expressed genes , such as Fgf4 , are regulated by the Sox2 - Pou5f1 / Oct4 complex ( Boyer et al . , 2005 ; Chen et al . , 2008 ; Kondoh and Kamachi , 2010 ) . As these genes include Sox2 and Pou5f1 themselves , it appears that ESC states are stabilized by an autoregulatory loop . In addition , Sox2 and Pou5f1 / Oct4 are two of the essential four transcription factors initially identified for induced pluripotent stem cell ( iPSC ) production ( Takahashi and Yamanaka , 2006 ) , indicating their pivotal contribution to the ESC state . Sox2 - Pou5f1 / Oct4 complex function is also essential for the formation of the inner cell mass of pre - implantation embryos , from which ESCs are derived ( Avilion et al . , 2003 ) , and of the epiblast of the post - implantation embryo . However , this complex is downregulated in embryos after somatic differentiation is initiated ( Iwafuchi - Doi et al . , 2012 ) . In zebrafish embryos , the SoxB1 - Pou5f1 complex also regulates early developmental processes , including embryo patterning ( Okuda et al . , 2010 ; Onichtchouk et al . , 2010 ; Shih et al . , 2010 ) . SoxB1 proteins in neural development The neural plate ( the embryonic neural progenitor tissue ) expresses Sox2 ( Kishi et al . , 2000 ; Takemoto et al . , 2011 ; Uwanogho et al . , 1995 ) , and this expression persists in all neural progenitor / stem cells throughout life ( Pevny and Placzek , 2005 ; Pevny and Nicolis , 2010 ; Suh et al . , 2007 ) . Presumably , the same Sox2 protein recruits different partner proteins during development that fulfil context - dependent regulatory functions , in addition to Pou3f proteins , which are common Sox2 partners during neural development ( Tanaka et al . , 2004 ) . SoxB1 proteins maintain the neural stem / progenitor state of cells by preventing the transition to a more advanced developmental stage that is marked by SoxC expression ( Graham et al . , 2003 ) . In addition , it is possible that SoxB1 proteins PRIMER Development 140 ( 20 ) A B Sox2 Sox11 Pou3f2 SoxB1 - Pou3f target genes SoxC - Pou3f target genes Common targets E13 . 5 mouse spinal cord VZ SVZ Nuclear Pou3f2 Cytoplasmic Sox11 Sox2 Sox2 Gli proteins Shh signalling Activating Gli proteins Pou3f2 ( GliA ) Sox2 HH16 chicken spinal cord Floor plate ( Shh source ) GliA gradient Sox2 - GliA target genes Sox2 - GliA target genes in ventral neuralprogenitors Sox2 Shh gene Fig . 5 . Developmental regulation by Sox - partner complexes during neural tube development and patterning . ( A ) An example in which one component of the Sox - partner complex is replaced with another from a related protein family , thereby causing a step - wise but gradual change in the developmental state because of the sharing of a fraction of target genes between the two complexes . The example shown is the transition in the developing spinal cord from SoxB1 - dependent neural progenitor cells in the ventricular zone ( VZ ) to SoxC - dependent postmitotic neural progenitors in the subventricular zone ( SVZ ) . These Sox proteins share Pou3f1 / 2 , which is expressed and localized in the nucleus in these two zones , and activate nestin ( Nes ) expression in VZ and SVZ as their common regulatory targets .

D E V E L O P M E N T 4137 PRIMER Development 140 ( 20 ) also support the survival of neural stem / progenitor cells , as a large decrease in SoxB1 activity results in the massive neural tissue degeneration ( Ferri et al . , 2004 ) . An important regulatory target of Sox2 in the brain is the Shh gene , the activity of which is essential for stem cell maintenance in the hippocampus and for hypothalamus development ( Favaro et al . , 2009 ; Zhao et al . , 2012 ) . The downstream effectors of the hedgehog ( Hh ) pathway , the Gli proteins , in turn act as Sox2 partners during the Hh signal - dependent activation of transcription factor genes , such as Nkx2 . 2 ( NK2 homeobox 2 ) , Olig2 ( oligodendrocyte transcription factor 2 ) , Nkx6 . 1 and Nkx6 . 2 , which are characteristic of ventral spinal cord neural progenitors ( Oosterveen et al . , 2012 ; Peterson et al . , 2012 ) . This represents a paradigm for signal - dependent activation of Sox - partner complexes ( Fig . 5B ) . The expression of Sox3 , another SoxB1 protein , largely overlaps with that of Sox2 in neural and sensory tissues ( Dee et al . , 2008 ; Nishimura et al . , 2012 ; Okuda et al . , 2006 ; Uchikawa et al . , 2011 ; Wood and Episkopou , 1999 ) . Sox3 itself is dispensable in mice ( Rizzoti et al . , 2004 ; Weiss et al . , 2003 ) , but it safeguards Sox2 functions by functional redundancy ( Iwafuchi - Doi et al . , 2011 ; Rizzoti and Lovell - Badge , 2007 ) . Sox1 , the third SoxB1 , is first activated weakly in a part of the developing anterior neural plate , then strongly in the developing spinal cord , and finally throughout the neural tube in mouse and chicken embryos ( Cajal et al . , 2012 ; Uchikawa et al . , 2011 ; Wood and Episkopou , 1999 ) . The functions of Sox1 are largely shared with those of Sox2 and Sox3 , although it has a unique function during the migration of neuronal precursors in the ganglionic eminence ( Ekonomou et al . , 2005 ) and in the lens ( Nishiguchi et al . , 1998 ) . Other Sox proteins in the nervous system Sox21 , a SoxB2 protein with transcriptional repression activity , is often co - expressed with Sox2 in the neural , sensory and endodermal tissues ( Uchikawa et al . , 1999 ) . The repressive activity of Sox21 modifies the balance between progenitor cell maintenance and the progression to postmitotic neural development , during which time SoxC activity is involved ( Graham et al . , 2003 ; Sandberg et al . , 2005 ) . In the adult hippocampus , Sox21 represses the expression of the transcriptional repressor Hes5 to promote neurogenesis ( Matsuda et al . , 2012 ) . Sox9 is also expressed in the developing CNS , and is essential for the establishment and maintenance of multipotent neural stem cells ( Cheng et al . , 2009 ; Scott et al . , 2010 ) . During the late stages of neural development , Sox9 regulates gliogenesis in neural stem cells ( Stolt et al . , 2003 ) using NFIA as its partner protein ( Kang et al . , 2012 ) . Within the glial cells , oligodendrocyte development is redundantly supported by co - expressed Sox9 and Sox10 ( Stolt et al . , 2003 ) , which repress suppressor of fused ( Sufu ) expression ( Pozniak et al . , 2010 ) . SoxE proteins during neural crest development Neural crest cells delaminate from the dorsal border of closing neural tube and give rise to the peripheral nervous system and melanocytes , and ( in the cephalic region ) to muscle and bone precursors as well . The SoxE family member Sox9 is expressed initially in the NC - competent cell population present in the dorsal neural tube ( Cheung and Briscoe , 2003 ) . As these cells migrate from the neural tube , the expression of Sox10 , the major NC regulator , is activated in a Sox9 - dependent manner ( Betancur et al . , 2010 ) . Sox9 cooperates with Ets1 and cMyb to activate Sox10 in the cranial NC ( Betancur et al . , 2010 ) . Sox10 first interacts with the following partner factors : Mef2c for the cranial NC ( Agarwal et al . , 2011 ) ; Pax3 for melanocytes ( Bondurand et al . , 2000 ) ; and Pou3f1 / 2 for Schwann cell development ( Kuhlbrodt et al . , 1998 ) . These Sox10 - partner complexes then activate a second set of Sox10 partner genes , such as Mitf for melanocytes ( Bondurand et al . , 2000 ) and Egr2 for Schwann cells ( Ghislain and Charnay , 2006 ; Reiprich et al . , 2010 ) , thereby activating the genes characteristic of their respective terminally differentiated cells , e . g . connexin 32 ( Gjb1 ) and myelin protein zero during Schwann cell development ( Bondurand et al . , 2001 ; LeBlanc et al . , 2007 ) . Sox2 in the sensory placodes Sensory placodes ( i . e . the nasal , lens , otic and taste bud placodes , as well as the hypophyseal placode ) , which are the precursors of sensory tissues , develop from the cephalic ectoderm and express Sox2 as a key regulator ( Okubo et al . , 2006 ; Schlosser et al . , 2008 ; Uchikawa et al . , 2011 ; Wood and Episkopou , 1999 ) . All of these placodes express N - cadherin ( cadherin 2 , Cdh2 ) in a Sox2 - dependent fashion during their morphogenesis ( Matsumata et al . , 2005 ) . Pax6 and Pou2f1 ( Oct1 ) act as Sox2 partners during nasal and lens placode development ( Donner et al . , 2007 ; Kamachi et al . , 1998 ; Kamachi et al . , 2001 ) . The hypophyseal placode also expresses Sox3 , and Sox3 deficiency causes pituitary defects in mice , consistent with an important role for Sox3 in this tissue ( Rizzoti et al . , 2004 ) . The otic placodes express Sox9 and Sox2 ( Mak et al . , 2009 ) , both of which play specific roles during inner ear development . Sox9 is involved during early otocyst development ( Saint - Germain et al . , 2004 ) , and its mutational disruption in mouse leads to the failure of otic placode invagination ( Barrionuevo et al . , 2008 ) . Sox2 is involved in the production and maintenance of the neural progenitors in the otocysts , i . e . the sensory patches . Inner ear - specific loss of Sox2 expression in mutant mice results in the loss of neural components : hair cells and supporting cells ( Kiernan et al . , 2005 ) . During hair cell development , Sox2 cooperates with the Six1 - Eya1 complex to activate the bHLH protein gene Atoh1 ( Ahmed et al . , 2012 ; Neves et al . , 2011 ; Neves et al . , 2012 ) . Sox2 and Atoh1 then cooperate to prime cells for hair cell development , which is initiated upon Sox2 downregulation ( Dabdoub et al . , 2008 ) . An analogous scenario occurs during the development of vestibulo - cochlear ganglion neurons , where the bHLH proteins are neurogenin 1 and Neurod1 ( Evsen et al . , 2013 ; Puligilla et al . , 2010 ) . SoxG ( Sox15 ) in skeletal muscle regeneration Sox15 - null mice are grossly normal , but show defects in skeletal muscle regeneration from satellite cells , which are muscle stem cells for regeneration ( Lee et al . , 2004 ; Maruyama et al . , 2005 ) . It has been shown that Sox15 recruits Fhl3 ( four and a half LIM domains 3 ) as a partner factor to regulate the Foxk1 gene ( forkhead box protein K1 ) , which is essential for the cell cycle progression of myogenic progenitor cells ( Meeson et al . , 2007 ) . The Sox trio ( Sox9 and Sox5 / 6 ) in chondrogenesis during skeletal development The crucial role of Sox9 during skeletal development was first indicated when heterozygous human SOX9 mutations were identified as the cause of campomelic dysplasia , a skeletal dysmorphology syndrome associated with male - to - female sex reversal ( Foster et al . , 1994 ; Wagner et al . , 1994 ) . Sox9 + / − heterozygous mouse mutants die perinatally because of skeletal abnormalities ( Bi et al . , 2001 ) . Sox9 is highly expressed throughout the chondrocyte lineage , from mesenchymal chondroprogenitors to D E V E L O P M E N T 4138 hypertrophic chondrocytes , exhibiting an expression profile similar to that of the type II collagen gene Col2a1 ( Ng et al . , 1997 ; Zhao et al . , 1997 ) , and it is essential throughout these developmental stages ( Dy et al . , 2012 ) . Sox9 binding to the Col2a1 intronic enhancer is required for the activation of the Col2a1 gene ( Bell et al . , 1997 ; Lefebvre et al . , 1997 ) , but strong activation of the 48 bp Col2a1 minimal enhancer occurs only when Sox9 and the SoxD proteins Sox5 and Sox6 ( Sox5 / 6 ) together bind to several sites in the enhancer ( Lefebvre et al . , 1998 ) . The same combination of Sox9 and Sox5 / 6 , known as the ‘Sox trio’ is involved in the activation of many extracellular matrix genes , e . g . aggrecan ( Acan ) and Col11a2 , which are secreted by the chondrocytes ( Han and Lefebvre , 2008 ) . This ‘Sox trio’ primarily functions as combination of a Sox9 homodimer and multiple Sox5 / 6 dimers that bind to adjacent DNA sites ( Fig . 4D ) . Indeed , individuals with mutations in the SOX9 dimerization domain develop campomelic dysplasia without causing sex reversal ( Bernard et al . , 2003 ; Sock et al . , 2003 ) . In line with this , single knockouts of Sox5 or Sox6 in mice lead to mild skeletal abnormalities , whereas a Sox5 / 6 double knockout leads to a lack of chondrogenesis despite normal Sox9 expression ( Smits et al . , 2001 ) , thereby confirming the functional cooperation of SoxD and SoxE proteins during chondrogenesis . The molecular mechanism underlying the SoxD - SoxE cooperation has not been clarified . Sry and Sox9 in sex determination and testis development Following the discovery of SRY / Sry ( Gubbay et al . , 1990 ; Sinclair et al . , 1990 ) , the involvement of Sox9 in male sex determination was recognized on the basis of genetic analysis of human campomelic dysplasia , as mentioned above , in which the majority of XY individuals with heterozygous SOX9 mutations exhibit male - to - female sex reversal ( Foster et al . , 1994 ; Wagner et al . , 1994 ) . In mouse embryos , Sry is expressed transiently between E10 . 5 and E12 . 5 in the somatic supporting cells of the undetermined gonads , which triggers the differentiation of these cells into Sertoli cells during subsequent development . Sry directly activates Sox9 synergistically with steroidogenic factor 1 ( Sf1 , Nr5a1 ) via the testis - specific enhancer of Sox9 ( Tes ) ( Sekido and Lovell - Badge , 2008 ) . After Sox9 expression has been activated beyond a crucial level , its expression is maintained in Sertoli cells via positive - feedback loops , including autoregulation , whereby Sox9 activates the Tes enhancer cooperatively with Sf1 . Sox9 then activates other genes that play crucial roles during testis development , such as Amh ( anti - Müllerian hormone ) and Pgds ( prostaglandin D synthase ) ( Fig . 4C ) ; Amh is activated by the cooperative action of Sox9 and Sf1 ( De Santa Barbara et al . , 1998 ) , while Pgds is activated by the Sox9 dimer ( Wilhelm et al . , 2007 ) . Another SoxE gene , Sox8 , is also activated in the Sertoli cells following Sox9 expression , and plays essential roles in the maintenance of testicular functions at later stages ( Barrionuevo et al . , 2009 ) . SoxF proteins in the initiation of endoderm development The involvement of SoxF proteins in endoderm development was first indicated in Xenopus ( Hudson et al . , 1997 ) . In early mouse embryos , the SoxF protein Sox7 is expressed in the primitive endoderm , whereas another SoxF protein , Sox17 , is expressed primarily in the definitive endoderm . During the derivation of the endoderm from the epiblast , a Sox2 - Pou5f1 / Oct4 complex switches to a Sox17 - Pou5f1 / Oct4 pair ( Aksoy et al . , 2013 ) , analogous to the case shown in Fig . 5A . Sox7 / 17 - expressing cells intercalate with each other when the definitive endoderm is formed ( Kwon et al . , 2008 ) . Sox17 knockout mouse embryos develop severe defects in gut tube formation ( Kanai - Azuma et al . , 2002 ) . In fish species , endodermal Sox17 is under the regulation of Sox32 ( also known as ‘casanova’ ) , a fish - specific SoxF ( Dickmeis et al . , 2001 ; Kikuchi et al . , 2001 ) . During later endodermal development , Sox2 also participates in the regulation of foregut and trachea in mice ( Que et al . , 2009 ; Que et al . , 2007 ) . SoxF proteins in vascular / lymphatic development The SoxF proteins Sox7 / 17 / 18 are all expressed in endothelial cells during mouse vascular development . The first insight into SoxF functions during vascular development was provided by the spontaneous mouse mutation Ragged , which results in the synthesis of Sox18 with a truncated C - terminal domain ( Pennisi et al . , 2000b ) . Homozygous Ragged embryos exhibit severe cardiovascular defects , as well as hair follicle defects ( discussed below ) , presumably owing to dominant - negative effects over other SoxF and related Sox proteins ( Pennisi et al . , 2000b ) . By contrast , Sox18 - null knockout mice are viable and exhibit only minor coat defects ( Pennisi et al . , 2000a ) . Sox17 knockout mouse embryos exhibit cardiovascular defects , whereas Sox17 / 18 double knockout embryos have more severe defects than Sox17 single knockout in regions where Sox7 is only weakly expressed . Sox7 - null embryos die around E14 . 5 due to cardiovascular defects ( Wat et al . , 2012 ) . These results support the overlapping functions of Sox7 / 17 / 18 ( Sakamoto et al . , 2007 ) . It is thought that these SoxF proteins play important roles during the establishment and maintenance of the integrity of blood vessels ( Downes et al . , 2009 ) , employing Mef2c ( myocyte enhancer factor 2C ) as a partner factor ( Hosking et al . , 2001 ) and by regulating Vcam1 ( vascular cell - adhesion molecule 1 ) ( Hosking et al . , 2004 ) , N - cadherin and Mmp7 ( metalloprotease 7 ) expression ( Hoeth et al . , 2012 ) . Sox18 is also involved in lymphatic development . In humans , SOX18 mutations cause hypotrichosis - lymphedema - telangiectasia syndrome , which involves lymphatic dysfunction . In mice , Sox18 is expressed by a subset of cardinal vein cells and directly activates Prox1 ( prospero - related homeobox 1 ) gene transcription by binding to its proximal promoter ; Prox1 expression then causes these cells to differentiate into lymphatic endothelial progenitor cells ( François et al . , 2008 ) . Sox proteins and hair follicle development The hair follicle , the site of hair growth , comprises two tissue components , the dermal papilla of condensed mesenchyme and the epithelial hair bulb cells that serve as the stem cells of hair shaft , which interact with each other to control overall hair growth . Sox2 and Sox18 play major regulatory roles in the dermal papilla and Sox9 in the hair bulb ( Clavel et al . , 2012 ; Driskell et al . , 2009 ; Pennisi et al . , 2000b ) . In the skin on the back of the mouse , four different hair types exist , which are produced in three waves during embryogenesis : guard hairs during the first wave ( ~ E14 . 5 ) , awl and auchene hairs during the second wave ( ~ E16 . 5 ) , and zigzag hairs during the third wave ( E18 . 5 ) . Sox2 is expressed in the developing papillae in the first and second waves , and in the papillae of guard / awl / auchene hairs throughout life , but not in the papillae of zigzag hairs ( Driskell et al . , 2009 ) . Hair follicle - specific knockout of Sox2 results in growth impairment of the non - zigzag hairs ( Clavel et al . , 2012 ) . This effect of Sox2 inactivation is partly attributed to loss of the expression of a BMP antagonist sclerostin domain - containing protein 1 ( Sostdc1 ) , a direct regulatory target of Sox2 ( Clavel et al . , 2012 ) . All embryonic dermal papillae express Sox18 , but Sox18 - null mutant mice show only a reduction of the PRIMER Development 140 ( 20 ) D E V E L O P M E N T 4139 PRIMER Development 140 ( 20 ) zigzag hair type ( Pennisi et al . , 2000a ) . This difference in Sox2 dependence and Sox18 dependence distinguishes non - zigzag and zigzag hairs . However , expression of the dominant - negative form of Sox18 ( Ragged ) in the heterozygous condition causes the loss of auchene hairs in addition to zigzag hairs , and in the homozygous condition leads to the entire loss of hairs ( Pennisi et al . , 2000b ) . This observation suggests inhibition of the function of related proteins , possibly Sox2 , by dominant - negative Sox18 . In the hair bulb compartment , Sox9 plays a major role in hair development , and skin - specific knockout of Sox9 results in the loss of hair shaft stem cells , causing alopecia ( Vidal et al . , 2005 ) , whereas loss of the Sox9 repressor Trps1 ( a GATA - type transcription factor ) causes hypertrichosis in humans ( Fantauzzo et al . , 2012 ) . Additionally , Sox21 expressed in the hair bulb plays a role in regulating the hair cycle ( Kiso et al . , 2009 ) . SoxC proteins have versatile functions The SoxC proteins Sox4 / 11 / 12 are expressed widely in embryonic tissues , with the highest expression levels found in neural and mesenchymal progenitor cells . Sox4 and Sox11 knockout mice develop multiple organ defects ( Schilham et al . , 1996 ; Sock et al . , 2004 ) , whereas Sox12 knockout mice are grossly normal ( Hoser et al . , 2008 ) . However , various combinations of homo - and heterozygous SoxC mutations indicate that continued and cumulative activities of these three genes are required for widespread organ development ; increasingly severe organ hypoplasia phenotypes were found with decreasing wild - type SoxC alleles ( Bhattaram et al . , 2010 ) . Partially SoxC - deficient embryos ( Sox11 − / − , Sox4 + / − Sox11 + / − , etc . ) also display malformation of various organs . For example , Sox4 − / − Sox11 − / − embryos are minute at E9 . 5 and show highly severe organ defects and extensive cell death . Nevertheless , these embryos appropriately express genes involved in cell lineages and embryo patterning , such as Pax1 / 7 , Otx2 ( orthodenticle homolog 2 ) , Shh and Bmp4 ( bone morphogenetic protein 4 ) ( Bhattaram et al . , 2010 ) . This suggests that SoxC proteins play important roles during early embryogenesis in sustaining neural and mesenchymal progenitor cells , rather than in cell lineage specification . In support of this , a reported target of SoxC is Tead2 ( TEA domain family member 2 ) , which is a transcriptional mediator of the Hippo signalling pathway that is crucial for organ size regulation ( Bhattaram et al . , 2010 ) . However , during more advanced developmental stages , SoxC proteins regulate cell differentiation and tissue patterning . For example , following the initiation of neurogenesis in the CNS , SoxC protein expression becomes confined to post - mitotic differentiating neurons , which complements SoxB1 protein expression in neural progenitor cells ( Tanaka et al . , 2004 ) . During these stages , a SoxC target is the neuron - specific tubulin gene Tubb3 ( tubulin β 3 , class 3 ) ( Bergsland et al . , 2006 ) . During Xenopus pronephros development , Sox11 and Wt1 ( Wilms tumor 1 homolog ) combine to regulate Wnt4 , which is essential for nephric tissue development ( Murugan et al . , 2012 ) . Genome - wide approaches to studying Sox proteins : new interacting partners , interacting sites and an emerging pioneer factor function The recent development of high - throughput proteomic / genomic approaches has enabled the systematic identification of Sox2 - interacting proteins and Sox2 - bound genomic sites . For example , Engelen et al . ( Engelen et al . , 2011 ) , using neural stem cell lines , identified a series of Sox2 - interacting proteins , including 19 transcription factors as candidate Sox2 partners , in addition to the Sox2 - interacting co - activator and co - repressors discussed above . Among these transcription factors , chromodomain helicase DNA - binding protein 7 ( Chd7 ) was investigated and was shown to bind close to genomic positions occupied by Sox2 in the vicinity of many genes . Moreover , knockdown of Sox2 reduced the occupancy of both Sox2 and Chd7 , and reduced expression of the potential target genes in a way analogous to Chd7 knockdown , indicating that Chd7 functions as an important partner of Sox2 in neural stem cells . In support of this notion , Chd7 often colocalizes with Sox2 in ESC genomes ( Schnetz et al . , 2010 ) . Furthermore , using a proteomics approach , Sox21 was found to be associated with Sox2 during ESC differentiation ( Mallanna et al . , 2010 ) . Analyses of the genomic regions bound by Sox2 and other factors ( Boyer et al . , 2005 ; Chen et al . , 2008 ) not only confirmed that Sox2 and Pou5f1 are functional partners in ESC regulation , but also indicated that the same genomic sites are frequently co - bound by other transcription factors , such as Nanog . These observations suggest that the partnering between a Sox protein and its co - DNA - binding protein serves as a core of higher - order transcription factor complex . It must be noted that , although ESCs and other cells cultured in vitro offer an abundant source of material for such high - throughput studies , these in vitro cultured cells may differ from real embryonic cells . For example , oestrogen receptor - related b ( Esrrb ) has been identified as a Sox2 partner in ESCs ( Hutchins et al . , 2013 ) and was shown to be essential for ESC maintenance in serum - free culture media ( Festuccia et al . , 2012 ; Martello et al . , 2012 ) , but in normal embryogenesis Esrrb is not expressed in the embryo proper but is required only for placental development ( Mitsunaga et al . , 2004 ; Pettersson et al . , 1996 ) . In the future , the analysis of cells isolated from embryonic tissue will be needed to validate the in vivo relevance of these interactions . The recently identified function of transcription factors as pioneer factors ( Liber et al . , 2010 ; Xu et al . , 2009a ) may also apply to Sox proteins . The binding of a pioneer factor to a regulatory region does not elicit gene activation , but places the gene in a state poised for transcription . The subsequent recruitment of additional transcriptional factors to the site , or replacement of the pioneer factor with an actuating factor , then activates the genes that are characteristic of differentiated cells ( Bergsland et al . , 2011 ) . Sox2 - bound genomic sites in ESCs are often associated with such genes , which are not expressed in ESCs but are activated in , for example , neural progenitor cells . Moreover , many SoxB1 - bound genomic sites present in neural progenitor cells are also involved in the regulation of neuron - specific genes that will be activated later when SoxB1 is replaced with SoxC ( Bergsland et al . , 2011 ) , suggesting that Sox proteins exhibit general pioneer factor functions . If these SoxB1 factors do indeed function as pioneers , their knockdown will affect occupancy by the second factor , thereby inhibiting developmental progression . However , many interesting issues remain unresolved , such as whether the pioneer factor function of Sox proteins still need partners . Conclusions and perspective As exemplified by the cases documented in this Primer , Sox proteins do not exert their activating or repressive regulatory functions when they bind to DNA on their own , but instead bind specific DNA sequences in combination with partner proteins to exert their effects . The combinatorial code of target specificity produced by Sox proteins and their partner proteins ( the ‘Sox - partner code’ ) ( Kamachi et al . , 2000 ; Kondoh and Kamachi , 2010 ) ensures the stringent selection of target genes in the genome . In D E V E L O P M E N T 4140 addition , changes in one component of the Sox - partner complex facilitate the stepwise progression of developmental processes , whereas the formation of co - activating regulatory loops between Sox and its partner proteins stabilizes the state of cell differentiation ( Kondoh and Kamachi , 2010 ; Kondoh et al . , 2004 ) . These basic principles will broadly apply to other transcription factor families that function as transcription factor complexes . The recent advancement of genome - wide , high - throughput approaches holds promise to gaining an overall view of the gene regulatory networks that operate in the spatiotemporal dynamics of embryogenesis . Availability of more microscale analysis will be of great help in the analysis of embryonic tissues . To inquire into and to experimentally validate the regulatory networks in developing embryos , the refinement of gene knockout / knock - in technologies , such as inducible systems and CRISPR / Cas technology - based tailor - made gene manipulations ( e . g . Cong et al . , 2013 ) will make invaluable contributions . Such approaches will allow highly time - resolved and tissue - restricted analysis of the impact of changes in the activity of Sox or other transcription factors . Such molecular manipulations could include mutations in the Sox - partner molecular interface . In this respect , the information that lags behind the above - mentioned advances is the structural characterization of Sox - partner complexes . The structural data available to date are only those of DNA - bound Sox HMG domains ( e . g . Reményi et al . , 2003 ) , rather than real complexes of full - length Sox and partner factors . Solving the three - dimensional structures of representative Sox - partner complexes on target DNA will contribute greatly to the elucidation of Sox partner - dependent regulations at the molecular level .
