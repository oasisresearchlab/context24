Modeling approaches usually neglect inﬂuences of polymer - speciﬁc molecular features aiming to describe semiﬂexible polymers universally . Here , we investigate the inﬂuence of molecular details on networks assembled from ﬁlamentous actin , intermediate ﬁlaments , and synthetic DNA nanotubes . In contrast to prevalent theoretical assumptions , we ﬁnd that bulk properties are aﬀected by various inter - ﬁlament interac - tions . We present evidence that these interactions can be merged into a single parameter in the frame of the glassy wormlike chain model . The interpretation of this parameter as a polymer spe - ciﬁc stickiness is consistent with observations from macro - rheological measurements and reptation behavior . Our ﬁndings demonstrate that stickiness should generally not be ignored in semiﬂexible polymer models . Semiﬂexible polymers play a central role in biological systems as major building blocks of intracellular scaf - folds and extracellular matrices . Among the most abun - dant semiﬂexible cytoskeletal biopolymers are ﬁlamen - tous actin ( F - actin ) and intermediate ﬁlaments ( IF ) [ 1 , 2 ] . Network structures formed by these polymers exhibit unique viscoelastic properties , which cannot be easily de - duced from the well - established theoretical frameworks for linear ﬂexible polymers or rigid rods [ 3 ] . Classical polymer physics theories typically try to avoid details of molecular properties and mostly reduce semiﬂexible poly - mers to their size and stiﬀness in order to establish uni - versal models . Networks are modeled either as entangled networks , as in the tube model [ 4 – 6 ] , or as cross - linked networks as in the aﬃne model [ 7 ] . Many features of the tube model , such as the scaling of the plateau modulus with monomer concentration and the behavior of single ﬁlaments within a network , indeed ﬁt very well to the experimental data for F - actin [ 4 , 8 ] . The aﬃne model has been demonstrated to predict the correct scaling of the plateau modulus in terms of concentration and cross - linker density for cross - linked F - actin [ 9 , 10 ] , but also for vimentin and keratin IF in the presence of MgCl 2 [ 11 – 13 ] . In reality , however , biopolymers without added cross - linkers already display adhesive interactions partially screened by electrostatic repulsion [ 14 – 17 ] . For F - actin , minor impurities and aging eﬀects are reported to cause a strong batch - to - batch variation of the network proper - ties [ 6 , 18 ] . IF networks feature pronounced hydropho - bic interactions causing a weak concentration scaling of the network stiﬀness and a pronounced strain - stiﬀening in the non - linear deformation regime [ 19 – 21 ] . These ef - fects can neither be explained by the tube nor by the aﬃne deformation model . Furthermore , recent experi - mental studies on F - actin and DNA - based semiﬂexible polymers present evidence that central predictions of the tube model in respect to the persistence length l p might be false [ 22 , 23 ] . Here , we employ the natural ﬁlaments F - actin , vi - mentin and keratin IF as well as purely artiﬁcial double - crossover DNA nanotubes ( DX tubes ) in order to investi - gate the inﬂuence of ( unspeciﬁc ) adhesive interactions on the rheology of semiﬂexible polymer networks . DX tubes are used as an additional synthetic semiﬂexible polymer model - system based on the self - assembly of DNA tiles [ 24 , 25 ] . These tubes , with a diameter between 7 and 20 nm , a persistence length of around 4 µm , a contour length of several micrometers , and a negative surface charge , were chosen for their similarity to the biopoly - mers under investigation ( Table SI [ 26 ] ) . FIG . 1 displays typical results for F - actin ( 0 . 5 g / l ) , DX tubes ( 1 g / l ) , vimentin ( 1 g / l ) and keratin K8 / K18 ( 0 . 5 g / l ) IF networks . The monomer concentrations were chosen in order to have a comparable mesh size ( See Sup - plemental Material [ 26 ] ) . All networks feature a storage modulus G ′ that appears ﬂat , but in fact behaves like a weak power law . F - actin and DX tubes display a begin - ning cross - over between G ′ and the loss modulus G ′′ while the cross - over frequency for vimentin and keratin IF has been previously shown to appear at frequencies higher than probed by macro - rheology [ 20 ] . The cross - over of G ′ and G ′′ denotes the transition from network properties dominated by ﬁlament interactions for low frequencies to the high frequency regime dominated by single ﬁlament behavior [ 27 ] . In order to enable a quantitative comparison of dif - ferent polymers and samples , we characterized the shear modulus via an approximation of the elastic modulus by 2 10 - 1 10 0 10 1 Frequency [ Hz ] 10 - 1 10 0 10 1 Frequency [ Hz ] 10 - 1 10 0 G ' , G ' ' [ P a ] G ' , G ' ' [ P a ] Actin DX tubes Vimentin Keratin 10 - 1 10 0 10 - 1 10 - 1 10 0 10 1 Frequency [ Hz ] G ' , G ' ' [ P a ] 10 - 1 10 0 10 - 1 Figure 1 . Typical storage modulus G ′ ( solid symbols ) and loss modulus G ′′ ( open symbols ) versus frequency . Black lines are the result of ﬁtting G’ ( solid ) and G” ( dashed ) simultaneously with Eq . ( 2 ) of the GWLC . Although the curves roughly re - semble a rubber plateau , they in fact follow a weak power law . The cross - over frequency between G ′ and G ′′ signiﬁ - cantly varies for diﬀerent polymer types . a local power law G ′ ( ω ) ∝ ω α with exponent α in the frequency regime below the cross - over . For IF , the lo - cal power law exponent α is around 0 . 07 and it is about twice as large for F - actin and DX tubes with α ≈ 0 . 14 [ FIG . S1 [ 26 ] ] . Additionally , we display the loss factor tan ( φ ) = G ′′ / G ′ at a ﬁxed frequency of 1 Hz . This fre - quency was chosen to avoid experimental noise in the low frequency regime while still maintaining a frequency inde - pendent loss factor for most samples [ FIG . S2 [ 26 ] ] . The loss factor has a strong sample to sample variation for F - actin ( tan ( φ ) = 0 . 40 ± 0 . 11 ) and decreases over DX tubes and vimentin to keratin ( tan ( φ ) = 0 . 11 ± 0 . 02 ) , meaning the networks become more elastic [ FIG . S1 [ 26 ] ] . We recently demonstrated that α and tan ( φ ) of com - posite networks of actin and vimentin ﬁlaments have in - termediate values in comparison to pure networks [ 28 ] . They can be tuned simply by the ratio of actin and vi - mentin ﬁlaments in the network . However , both the tube and the aﬃne model predict only a ﬂat plateau for fre - quencies below the cross - over [ 4 , 6 , 7 ] . These models are typically used to compare only the scaling predic - tions of the network stiﬀness with experimental data [ 4 – 7 , 9 , 10 , 22 , 23 , 29 – 34 ] . To our knowledge , a study by Schmidt et al . presents the sole ﬁt of the tube model to a measured frequency dependence of G ′ and G ′′ and shows only a rough agreement [ 35 ] . Thus , we need a diﬀerent model for explaining the actual frequency dependence of the complex shear modulus . The observed weak power laws are reminiscent of soft glassy systems and have been shown to be a main feature of micro - rheological experiments in cells , as well [ 36 ] . A phenomenological model providing a description of the weak power law behavior on a network level is the glassy wormlike chain model ( GWLC ) established by Kroy and Glaser [ 37 ] . This model is an extension of the worm - like chain ( WLC ) , the minimal model of a semiﬂexible polymer . The constituting idea is that the mode relax - ation times τ n of all eigenmodes of ( half - ) wavelength λ and modenumber n that are longer than a characteristic interaction length Λ are stretched exponentially : τ GWLC n = ( τ WLC n if λ n ≤ Λ τ WLC n e εN n if λ n > Λ . ( 1 ) Here , N n = λ n / Λ − 1 is the number of interactions per length λ . ε is the stretching parameter controlling how strong the modes are slowed down . The assumption of an exponential stretching is directly supported by the exper - imental observation of logarithmic tails of the dynamic structure factor in F - actin solutions [ 38 ] . The complex linear shear modulus in the high frequency regime is : G ∗ ( ω ) = Λ / ( 5 ξ 2 χ ( ω ) ) , ( 2 ) where ξ is the mesh size and χ ( ω ) is the micro - rheological , linear response function to a point force at the ends of the GWLC at frequency ω . The speciﬁc model used for this study has been comprehensively described previously [ 28 ] and more details are presented in the Supplemental Material [ 26 ] . We can ﬁt Eq . ( 2 ) directly to the macro - rheological data in the linear regime for each sample . The ﬁt param - eters are the mesh size ξ , the interaction length Λ and the stretching parameter ε . All other parameters were ﬁxed to literature values or experimentally obtained ( see Ta - ble SI [ 26 ] ) . Λ is determined by the cross - over frequency ω Λ = 2 π 5 l p k B T / (cid:0) ζ ⊥ Λ 4 (cid:1) with transverse drag coeﬃcient ζ ⊥ . For the ﬁtting of the IF networks , Λ is assumed to be below , but of the same order of magnitude as Λ for F - actin and DX tubes to account for a larger ω Λ [ FIG . S7 [ 26 ] ] . ε is the parameter that deﬁnes the functional dependence of G ∗ ( ω ) for frequencies ω < ω Λ . ξ is used as a free ﬁt parameter to obtain the correct network stiﬀ - ness because it only shifts the magnitude of G ∗ without any inﬂuence on the functional dependency . We then compare ε with the local power law exponent α and the loss factor tan ( φ ) ( FIG . 2 ) . It is worth noting that α , tan ( φ ) and ε are directly connected in the theory and their relation can be approximated analytically for ε ≫ 1 as presented in Ref . [ 39 ] . The comparison reveals that a small loss factor correlates with a small power law exponent . Moreover , we ﬁnd signiﬁcant diﬀerences in ε between all polymer types with mean values ± standard deviation of 6 . 7 ± 2 . 7 for actin , 13 . 4 ± 2 . 8 for DX tubes , 24 . 9 ± 1 . 7 for vimentin and 31 . 8 ± 7 . 2 for K8 / K18 [ FIG . S1 [ 26 ] ] . The original study by Kroy and Glaser suggests the in - terpretation of ε as a kinetic " stickiness " parameter [ 37 ] . 3 2 3 4 6 10 20 30 60 Stretching Parameter 10 - 1 10 0 E x ponen t , Lo ss F a c t o r Loss Factor Exponent Actin DX tubes Vimentin Keratin Figure 2 . Local power law exponent of G ′ ∝ ω α ( open sym - bols ) and loss factor tan ( φ ) = G ′′ / G ′ ( solid symbols ) versus stretching parameter ε . Each pair of data points represents one sample . The exponent was obtained from ﬁtting G ′ with a power law for frequencies smaller than the cross - over be - tween G ′ and G ′′ . The loss factor was obtained from ﬁtting tan ( φ ) locally with a power law at a frequency of 1 Hz . ε is the result from ﬁtting the complex shear modulus G ∗ to Eq . ( 2 ) for each sample . Dashed lines are the numerical results of an exemplary G ∗ GWLC where all parameters except ε are ﬁxed . ε can be thought of as the height of the free energy barri - ers of unspeciﬁc ﬁlament - to - ﬁlament interactions in units of k B T [ 38 ] . Later interpretations suggest a test polymer that can bind and unbind to " sticky " entanglement points by overcoming the energy barrier , which slows the con - tributions from long - wavelength bending modes during relaxation [ 40 ] . In the following , we will demonstrate that ε appears indeed as a polymer speciﬁc stickiness that combines all ﬁlament - to - ﬁlament interactions into one number . A look at the molecular details of biopolymers suggests several adhesive interactions as plausible candidates for sticky interactions . Since semiﬂexible biopolymers are relatively massive multi - molecular assemblies , errors such as misfoldings or hydrophobic loops [ 41 ] are expected to occur in general on a purely stochastic basis . While F - actin networks are considered as a model system for entangled semiﬂexible polymer networks , the batch - to - batch variation is suggested to be caused by very small amounts of cross - links [ 6 , 18 ] . DX tubes appear similar to F - actin in regards to their polyelectrolyte properties [ 16 ] . The higher ε could be a consequence of mishy - bridiazation during the assembly . The large ε of IFs can be explained by their dominant hydrophobic interactions [ 19 , 20 ] . These interactions are partially mitigatied by electrotstactic repulsion between vimentin IF [ 15 ] , lead - ing to a smaller ε in comparison to keratin . A more de - tailed discussion of ﬁlament - to - ﬁlament interactions can be found in the Supplemental Material [ 26 ] . The experimental data can be further compared to the model by calculating an exemplary G ∗ GWLC . The model parameters are ﬁxed to contour length L = 18 µm , l p = 4 µm , Λ = 1 µm , and ξ = 0 . 2 µm , resembling intermediate values of the experimental results , and only ε is varied . The obtained G ∗ GWLC ( ε ) are analyzed for each ε in the same way as the rheological data . Remarkably , the resulting curves for α GWLC ( ε ) and tan ( φ ) GWLC ( ε ) can already be viewed as a master curve for the experimental data without any rescaling , although L , l p , Λ and ξ diﬀer for every polymer type [ FIG . 2 ] . A bet - ter agreement between experimental data and the GWLC can be reached by calculating G ∗ GWLC ( ε ) for each poly - mer [ FIG . S3 [ 26 ] ] . In contrast to α and tan ( φ ) , ε is signiﬁcantly diﬀer - ent for all four polymers [ FIG . S1 [ 26 ] ] . Thus , ε is not only the key parameter of the GWLC , but it might be a key factor for deriving a universal master curve that uniﬁes systems with fundamentally diﬀerent molecular details , as well . It appears as a very robust quantity for characterizing the linear rheological behavior of semiﬂex - ible polymer networks and seems to provide a more uni - versal description of network properties than the pseudo plateau modulus G 0 . In contrast to the linear regime , it is well - known that the behavior of F - actin and IF at large deformations is drastically diﬀerent to each other [ 42 , 43 ] . To investi - gate these diﬀerences , the GWLC can be extended to the non - linear regime and the diﬀerential shear modu - lus K = d σ / d γ , deﬁned as the derivative of stress σ 10 - 2 10 - 1 10 0 10 1 10 2 Stress [ Pa ] 10 0 10 1 10 2 K / K li n Keratin Vimentin Actin DX ubest Figure 3 . Diﬀerential shear modulus K = d σ / d γ rescaled by its value in the linear regime K lin versus stress σ . Solid lines are single measurements . Dotted lines are replicated curves with the non - linear extension of the GWLC . F - actin and DX tubes have a similar behavior with weak to no strain - stiﬀening . Strain - stiﬀening is more pronounced for vimentin IF while keratin IF have the highest peak value K max at a much larger σ . F - actin and vimentin IF data reproduced from [ 28 ] . 4 over strain γ , can be measured with a ˙ γ - protocol as de - scribed previously [ 28 ] ( see Supplemental Material for de - tails [ 26 ] ) . Although K is measured in dependency of γ as in FIG . S4 [ 26 ] , it can be displayed over σ to enable a comparison with the model [ FIG . 3 ] . With this method , we are able to replicate K for F - actin , DX tubes and vimentin ﬁlament networks [ FIG . 3 , Table SI [ 26 ] ] . The initial softening of vimentin IF can be captured by an additional bond - breaking mecha - nism as described previously [ 28 ] . For keratin K8 / K18 , we can shift the peak of K to the correct σ , but un - derestimate K max by an order of magnitude . The phe - nomenology of keratin IF is potentially based on strong ﬁlament interactions as well as a small l p leading to two diﬀerent slopes for K due to a cross - over from a bend - ing to a stretching dominated regime . This behavior is better described by a triangular lattice model for physio - logical cross - linked networks [ 44 ] . Keratin IF act as some kind of limiting case for the applicability of the GWLC in the non - linear regime . The observation that the poly - mer with the largest ε behaves more like a cross - linked network supports the interpretation of ε as stickiness . The constituting idea of the GWLC in Eq . ( S3 ) can be implemented using an eﬀective mode dependent friction transversal to the ﬁlament ζ n = ζ ⊥ exp ( N n ε ) for λ n > Λ as well . If this increase of the transversal friction is indeed caused by sticky interactions , this should also increase the longitudinal friction and slow down the reptation of single ﬁlaments within the network . To test this reason - ing , we observed embedded ﬂuorescent tracer ﬁlaments and analyzed the mean - squared displacement ( MSD ) of the ﬁlament center parallel to the tangent vector as de - scribed previously [ 22 , 28 ] . Unfortunately , this technique is not applicable for keratin because there is no live stain for native keratin IF leading to their exclusion from the following analysis . For the following examination , the " tube " is simply the space formed by the geometrical con - straints due to the surrounding ﬁlaments that can be probed by a test polymer [ 45 ] . A quantitative comparison between diﬀerent polymer networks can be achieved by looking at the MSD at τ = 2 s , where the MSD is in a weak power law regime , rescaled by the tube width a [ FIG . 4 ] [ 46 , 47 ] . In this regime , the MSD is independent of the polymer length . We use the MSD instead of the more common longitudi - nal diﬀusion coeﬃcient because there is no diﬀusion for the stick - slip like systems investigated here . Both F - actin and DX tubes reveal a strong ﬁlament - to - ﬁlament variation with similar distributions . The dis - tribution of vimentin IF is dominated by signiﬁcantly smaller values in comparison to both F - actin ( p = 1 . 6 × 10 − 3 ) and DX tubes ( p = 3 . 1 × 10 − 2 ) [ FIG . 4 ( b ) , FIG . S5 [ 26 ] ] . The main diﬀerence between F - actin and DX tubes is that some DX tubes have a ﬂat MSD . This implies that they are stuck at their respective position and hints at mishybridization during the assembly pro - Actin 0 5 10 15 20 25 M S D ( = 2 s ) / a [ µ m ] τ Lag Time [ s ] 10 1 M S D / a [ µ m ] ActinDXtubesVimentin ( b ) ( a ) 10 0 10 0 10 - 1 DX Vimentin tubes n . s . * * * Figure 4 .

( b ) Distribution of MSD at lag time τ = 2 s rescaled by tube width a . Each data point is a single ﬁlament . The black cross denotes the median and illustrates that the overall motility decreases from F - actin over DX tubes to vimentin IF . cess . Such a behavior was not observed for F - actin [ FIG . S5 , [ 26 ] ] . In the tube model , the MSD ( τ = 2 s ) / a is expected to increase for smaller persistence lengths because the mode of transportation is dominated by ﬁlament undulations in this time regime [ 46 ] . Here , we see the exact opposite behavior . This means the assumption behind the persis - tence length scaling is either violated or overwritten by an additional factor like the proposed eﬀective friction . Recent Brownian dynamics simulations of entangled so - lutions of semiﬂexible polymers by Lang and Frey demon - strate , that polymer relaxation might have to be consid - ered as a many - body eﬀect with dynamic correlations instead of a diﬀusive motion along a tube [ 48 ] . Their simulations demonstrate that varying friction coeﬃcients strongly inﬂuence the interplay of a tracer polymer with its surrounding . This friction is not necessarily the same as the proposed sticky interactions . Including stickiness , however , could provide further insight into relaxation pro - cesses within a network that seem to be more complicated than assumed by the tube model . The motion of the tracer ﬁlaments could potentially be inﬂuenced by the attached ﬂuorescent dye . However , the labeling alone does not seem to impede ﬁlament mo - tion in networks [ 8 , 22 , 49 ] . Thus , the decrease of the MSD ( τ = 2 s ) / a from F - actin over DX tubes to vimentin IF while ε increases , supports the interpretation of ε as a polymer stickiness , which increases the longitudinal fric - tion and slows down ﬁlament motion . Considering the discussed limitations , it is remark - able that the GWLC captures most of the linear and non - linear macro - rheological properties of the semiﬂexi - ble polymer networks investigated here . The stretching parameter ε is more than a simple free ﬁt parameter . Our results consistently support the interpretation of ε as a polymer speciﬁc stickiness that strongly aﬀects rheolog - ical characteristics and might be able to overwrite scal - ing predictions in classical semiﬂexible polymer theories . The diﬀerent magnitudes of stickiness for F - actin and IF 5 may help to get a better understanding of their roles in living cells . Cells are able to modify network structures with numerous binding proteins , especially for F - actin . However , inherent sticky interactions such as hydropho - bic interactions for IF , would limit the ability to further tune network properties . At the same time , the high stickiness of IF contributes to their non - linear behavior and possibly inﬂuences cell properties under large defor - mations . We expect that the GWLC can also be used to analyze other sticky semiﬂexible polymers such as the re - cently investigated temperature dependent hydrophobic interactions in α - synuclein ﬁbril networks [ 17 ] . While the simplistic phenomenological nature of the GWLC di - minishes some explanatory power , it shows that inter - ﬁlament stickiness impacts semiﬂexible polymer networks and should be considered in polymer models aiming to fully describe the dynamics of such systems . The large size and high complexity of semiﬂexible polymers makes ﬁlament misfolding and impurities likely , even for suppos - edly interactionless proteins like F - actin . Including sticki - ness as a universal feature in semiﬂexible polymers means a paradigm shift in classical polymer physics because it allows to unify systems that where to date treated ei - ther as purely entangled or chemically cross - linked . This approach might help to further explain and resolve the current discrepancies between established models and ex - perimental data [ 22 , 23 ] .

Brieﬂy , proteins were expressed in E . coli , puriﬁed and stored in 8 M urea at − 80 ◦ C . Before use , K8 and K18 were mixed in equimolar ratios and renatured by dialysis against 8 M urea , 2 mM Tris – HCl ( pH 9 . 0 ) and 1 mM DTT with stepwise reduction of the urea concentration ( 6 M , 4 M , 2 M , 1 M , 0 M ) . Each dialysis step was done for 20min at room temperature , then the dialysis was continued overnight against 2 mM Tris - HCl , pH 9 . 0 , 1 mM DTT at 4 ◦ C . The dialyzed protein was kept on ice for a maximum of four days . The ﬁnal protein concentration was determined by measuring the absorption at 280nm using a DU 530 UV / Vis Spectrophotometer ( Beckman Coulter Inc . , USA ) . Assembly of keratin was initiated by addition of an equal volume of 18 mM Tris – HCl buﬀer ( pH 7 . 0 ) to renatured keratins resulting in a ﬁnal buﬀer condition of 10mM Tris – HCl ( pH 7 . 4 ) . Double - Crossover DNA Nanotubes All oligomers for hybridization of the DNA nanotubes were adapted from Ekani - Nkodo et al . [ 25 ] [ Table SII ] and purchased from Biomers . net with HPLC puriﬁcation . In order to assemble a nanotube network of a desired concentration the required strands ( SE1 - SE5 ) were mixed in equimolar concentration in an assembly buﬀer containing 40 mM Tris - acetate , 1 mM EDTA and 12 . 5mM Mg 2 + ( pH 8 . 3 ) . The concentration of each stock solution was conﬁrmed spectrophotometrically by a NanoDrop 1000 ( Thermo Fisher Scientifc Inc . , USA ) at a wavelength of 260nm . These strands were hybridized in a TProfessional Standard PCR Thermocycler ( Core Life Sciences Inc . , USA ) by denaturation for 10 min at 90 ◦ C and complementary base pairing for 20h between 80 ◦ C and 20 ◦ C by lowering the temperature by 0 . 5K every 10 min . After hybridization DNA nanotubes were stored at room temperature . For visualization the oligomer SE3 was modiﬁed with the ﬂuorescent Cyanine dye 3 with two additional spacer thymine bases in between . DNA nanotubes were labeled by partially or fully replacing the unlabeled oligo SE3 by SE3 - Cy3 . Actin Monomeric actin ( G - actin ) was obtained with an acetone powder prep from rabitt muscle , puriﬁed , and stored at − 80 ◦ C in G - Buﬀer ( 2 mM sodium phosphate buﬀer pH 7 . 5 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM DTT , 0 . 01 % NaN 3 ) as described previously [ 52 ] . Small sample volumes were thawed and kept on ice no longer than one day before experiments . The polymerization to F - actin was always induced by adding 1 / 10 volume fraction of 10 times concentrated F - Buﬀer ( 20 mM sodium phosphate buﬀer pH 7 . 5 , 1 M KCl , 10mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM ATP , 10 mM DTT ) to the ﬁnal sample solution . F - actin was ﬂuorescently labeled by polymerizing G - actin at 5 µM in a 1 : 1 ratio with Phalloidin – Tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate ( Phalloidin - TRITC - Sigma - Aldrich Co . , USA ) . 2 Vimentin Human vimentin was obtained from recombinant expression in E . coli and puriﬁed from inclusion bodies as described by Herrmann et al . [ 53 ] . Before the assembly into ﬁlaments , the puriﬁed vimentin was dialyzed in a stepwise fashion from 8 M urea against a 2 mM sodium phosphate buﬀer at pH 7 . 5 and kept on ice for a maximum of four days [ 54 ] . Polymerization was induced as described for actin . Fluorescent labeling was performed with Alexa Fluor 488 C5 Maleimide ( Thermo Fisher Scientifc Inc . , USA ) as described by Winheim et al . [ 55 ] . The only modiﬁcation was the removal of excess dye by elution over PD - 10 Desalting Columns ( GE Healthcare , USA ) . Unlabeled vimentin monomers were mixed with about 10 % labeled monomers before dialysis to obtain ﬂuorescently labeled ﬁlaments . Shear Rheology Shear rheology measurements were performed with a strain controlled ARES rheometer ( TA Instruments , USA ) equipped with a 40 mm plate - plate geometry at a gap width of 140µm . Biopolymer solutions were mixed on ice and assembled directly on the rheometer for 2 h at 25 ◦ C ( Actin , Vimentin ) or 20 ◦ C ( K8 / 18 ) . Hybridized DX tubes were carefully placed on the rheometer and allowed to equilibrate for 2 h at 20 ◦ C . To prevent both evaporation and artifacts from interfacial elasticity , samples were surrounded with sample buﬀer and sealed by a cap equipped with wet sponges . A dynamic time sweep with short measurements every 60 s at frequency of 1 Hz and a strain of 5 % was used to record ﬁlament assembly and equilibration . G ∗ ( ω ) was measured with a dynamic frequency sweep ranging from 0 . 01Hz to 80 Hz at a strain of 5 % . Fitting was performed with a self - written script in Mathematica ( Wolfram Research , USA ) . The diﬀerential shear modulus K = d σ / d γ was obtained from transient step rate measurements at strain rates of 0 . 025s − 1 , 0 . 1 s − 1 , and 0 . 25s − 1 directly after G ∗ ( ω ) measurements . The resulting stress - strain curves were smoothed with a spline ﬁt in MatLab ( MathWorks , USA ) and K was deﬁned as the gradient of stress σ divided by the gradient of strain γ . Mesh Size The mesh size of a semiﬂexible polymer network can be estimated by assuming a simple cubic network of rigid rods with the mass per length m L and the protein concentration c : ξ = r 3 m L c . ( S1 ) With m L = 2 . 66 × 10 − 11 g / m for F - actin [ 56 ] , 4 . 40 × 10 − 11 g / m for DX tubes [ 24 ] , 5 . 48 × 10 − 11 g / m for vimentin IF [ 50 , 57 ] and 3 . 15 × 10 − 11 g / m for keratin K8 / K18 IF [ 58 ] the employed concentrations ( c actin = 0 . 5 g / l , c DX = 1 . 0 g / l , c vimentin = 1 . 0 g / l , c keratin = 0 . 5 g / l ) should lead to networks with similar mesh sizes ( ξ actin = 0 . 40µm , ξ DX = 0 . 36 µm , ξ vimenin = 0 . 41µm , ξ keratin = 0 . 43 µm . Reptation Measurements Samples for single ﬁlament observations were prepared and analyzed as described previously [ 28 ] . Both ﬂuorescently labeled actin and vimentin were polymerized for one hour at room temperature . Labeled ﬁlaments were gently mixed with unlabeled monomers to a molar ratio between 1 : 2000 and 1 : 20000 and polymerized for one hour at 37 ◦ C . ( ± ) - 6 - Hydroxy - 2 , 5 , 7 , 8 - tetramethylchromane - 2 - carboxylic acid ( Trolox - Sigma - Aldrich Co . , USA ) was added to a ﬁnal concentration of 2 mM as an anti - photobleaching agent due to its radical scavenging and antioxidant activities . Labeled DX tubes were carefully pipetted into an unlabeled DX tube network containing no anti - photobleaching agents . The mixtures of labeled ﬁlaments embedded in an unlabeled network were placed between two glass slides , as described by Golde et al . [ 59 ] . F - actin samples were kept at room temperature for one hour prior to observation . Specimen with pure vimentin were polymerized directly in the sample chamber for two hours at room temperature . DX tube samples were left to equilibrate overnight at room temperature . Images of the embedded tracer ﬁlaments were recorded via an epiﬂuorescence microscope ( Leica DM - IRB , 100x oil objective , NA 1 . 35 - Leica Camera AG , Ger ) equipped with a CCD camera ( Andor iXon DV887 - Andor Technology 3 Ltd , UK ) . At least 10 ﬁlaments were captured in each sample with a frame rate of 10 Hz for 10 s . These ﬁlaments were chosen to be well away from the glass surface and had to lie within the focal plane to enable 2D tracking . Filament tracking was performed with the freely available ImageJ plugin JFilament ( http : / / imagej . nih . gov / ij / ) . All images of a single ﬁlament were summed up and a mean tube backbone was tracked from this overlay . For the MSD , the ﬁlament center was deﬁned as the point at the backbone with an equal distance to both ends . Its movement was analyzed as a projection on the tangent vector of the tube backbone at the corresponding position . Our deﬁnition of the ﬁlament center is susceptible to ﬂuctuations of the contour length caused by tracking errors and ﬁlament ends moving out of focus . Thus , we compared the MSD of the ﬁlament center to the MSD of the contour length over time divided by 4 . Filaments with a non - constant MSD of the contour length were excluded from analysis . For ﬁlaments where both the MSD of the contour length and the MSD of the ﬁlament center are constant and comparably small , the latter is only an upper bound of the actual ﬁlament movement . Contour Length The contour length of DX tubes was determined as the median length of more than 100 DX tubes absorbed on a glass surface . The histogram of the contour length of F - actin , vimentin IF and DX tubes is presented in Fig . S6 . The contour length of keratin K8 / 18 IF was assumed to have the same value as vimentin IF . This assumption is justiﬁed by the observation that keratin and vimentin IF have a very similar length distribution for longer times despite a faster initial annealing of keratin IF [ 60 ] . The glassy wormlike chain model The speciﬁc GWLC used for this study has been comprehensively described previously [ 28 , 37 , 38 ] . In general , the GWLC is an extension of the wormlike chain ( WLC ) for semiﬂexible polymer networks that takes into account the interactions of a test chain with its environment by stretching the mode relaxation spectrum of the WLC exponentially . Starting with the mode relaxation times of all eigenmodes of ( half - ) wavelength λ n = L / n and mode number n for a WLC with persistence length l p and the transverse drag coeﬃcient ζ ⊥ : τ WLC n = ζ ⊥ / ( l p k B Tπ 4 / λ 4 n + fπ 2 / λ 2 n ) , ( S2 ) the relaxation times of the GWLC are modiﬁed according to : τ GWLC n = ( τ WLC n if λ n ≤ Λ τ WLC n e εN n if λ n > Λ . ( S3 ) Here , N n = λ n / Λ − 1 is the number of interactions per length λ n , L the contour length of the test ﬁlament , Λ the typical distance between two interactions , and f describes a homogeneous backbone tension accounting for existing pre - stress . ε is the stretching parameter controlling how strong the modes are slowed down by interactions with the environment . The complex linear shear modulus in the high frequency regime is then : G ∗ ( ω ) = Λ / ( 5 ξ 2 χ ( ω ) ) , ( S4 ) with the mesh size ξ . χ ( ω ) is the micro - rheological , linear response function to a point force at the ends of the GWLC : χ ( ω ) = L 4 π 4 l 2p k B T ∞ X n = 1 1 ( n 4 + n 2 f / f E ) ( 1 + iωτ GWLC n / 2 ) . ( S5 ) Here , f E = l p k B Tπ 2 / L 2 is the Euler buckling force . f is set to zero for the linear regime . In the non - linear regime , the diﬀerential shear modulus K = d σ / d γ is approximated via Eq . ( S4 ) at a constant frequency as a function of the backbone tension f : K ( f ) = | G ∗ ω | ( f ) , ( S6 ) where f is related to the macroscopic stress σ via f = 5 σξ 2 . The eﬀect of pre - stress on the stretching parameter is introduced via a linear barrier height reduction : ε → ε − fδ / k B T , ( S7 ) 4 where δ should be interpreted as an eﬀective width of a free energy well . The mean values of ξ , Λ and ε obtained from ﬁtting the linear regime for each polymer type were used to replicate the measured curves . δ was used as the only free parameter to eﬀectively shift the peak of K both in terms of σ and the maximum value K max . An important question is how the other parameters are related to bottom up physical properties . The contour length L , for example , is naturally a broad distribution instead of a single value [ FIG . S6 ] . Diﬀerent shapes and widths of this distribution might inﬂuence the network properties in a way that cannot be captured by a single number . The mesh size ξ is rather an eﬀective concentration scaling than the actual distance between neighboring ﬁlaments , although it has the right order of magnitude . The pre - factor in Eq . ( S4 ) originates from a purely geometric deﬁnition of the mesh . A quantitative matching of ξ with rheological data has been proven to be diﬃcult for both F - actin and IF [ 6 , 20 ] . The interaction length Λ is the average contour length between two sticky interactions of a test polymer . Thus , it is considered as a smeared out version of the entanglement length L e in the original paper by Kroy and Glaser [ 37 ] although the GWLC is fundamentally diﬀerent to the picture of a coarse grained tube . A strict identiﬁcation of both appears to be too simple and the physical nature of Λ is still a matter of debate . In the tube model , L e has a simple scaling of the form L e ∝ l 1 / 5 p ξ 4 / 5 [ 61 ] while more advanced approaches lead to slightly diﬀerent exponents [ 30 ] . As expected , we cannot observe a systematic scaling of Λ with either persistence length l p or with mesh size ξ [ FIG . S7 ] . Its consistency for DX tubes and vimentin and keratin IF might contain some information about polymer speciﬁc interactions while the strong variation of Λ for F - actin is a direct consequence of the sample to sample variation of the cross - over frequency ω Λ . The ﬁnal interpretation of the interaction length Λ remains an important task for future investigations due to its strong inﬂuence on the transition between single polymer and interaction dominated network properties . 5 SUPPLEMENTARY FIGURES Actin DX tubes Vimentin Keratin 0 10 20 30 40 50 S t r e t c h i ng P a r a m e t e r Actin DX tubes Vimentin Keratin 0 0 . 05 0 . 1 0 . 15 0 . 2 P o w e r La w E x ponen t Actin DX tubes Vimentin Keratin 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 Lo ss F a c t o r n . s . n . s . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Figure S1 .

Sequences of the DNA oligonucleotides . DISCUSSION OF FILAMENT - TO - FILAMENT INTERACTIONS F - actin has been used as the model system for entangled semiﬂexible polymers for decades and exhibits the smallest ε . The main protein interactions are electrostatic forces due to a negative surface charge resulting in a repulsive potential shielded by ions in the buﬀer solution . Larger ion concentrations lead to attractive electrostatic forces causing counterion cloud condensation . The ion concentrations used for this study , however , are well below this transition and attractive ion eﬀects can be ruled out [ 16 ] . The reason for an ε > 1 are most likely minor impurities and aging eﬀects that have been shown to cause batch - to - batch variations of reconstituted F - actin networks [ 6 , 18 ] . These batch - to - batch variations are already suggested to be a consequence of very small amounts of cross - links by Morse [ 6 ] . A diﬀerent ε for diﬀerent batches is further supported by the observation , that diﬀerent actin preparations lead to diﬀerent power law exponents of G ′ [ 18 ] . In contrast , diﬀerent rheometers used for the same preparation change the magnitude , but not the power law exponent G ′ . DX tubes seem to be similar to F - actin in regards to their polyelectrolyte properties . It would be very interesting to compare the eﬀective electrostatic charge with ε quantitatively . A calculation of the eﬀective electrostatic charge of DX tubes , however , is non - trivial due to the cross - over DNA tiles structure , and the relative dielectric constant of the medium that depends on the unknown eﬀective ion concentration in the buﬀer [ 66 , 67 ] . The comparison of F - actin and double stranded DNA [ 16 ] suggests a higher charge density of DX tubes , which in turn is shielded by a higher Mg 2 + concentration in the buﬀer . Thus , the higher ε of DX tubes is more likely a consequence of the sub - fraction of 10 stuck ﬁlaments . This can be explained by mishybridization during the assembly leading to strong ﬁlament connections that are independent of electrostatic interactions . IF like vimentin and keratin ﬁlaments are known to be dominated by hydrophobic interactions [ 19 , 20 ] . These interactions are stronger for keratin due to electrostatic repulsion between vimentin IF , which partially mitigates hydrophobic attractions [ 15 ] . Keratin IF also express a tendency to form bundled and even clustered network structures at comparably low densities [ 68 , 69 ] . Bundling and clustering , however , should not appear at the protein concentration and buﬀer conditions employed [ 12 , 13 ] . REFERENCES [ 1 ] F . Huber , J . Schnauß , S . Rönicke , P . Rauch , K .
