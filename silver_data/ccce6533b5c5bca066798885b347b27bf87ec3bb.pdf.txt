Rationales behind these two strategies , however , were debated , especially regarding quanti - tative recommendations . The answers to “what is the safe distance” and “what is sufficient ventilation” are crucial to the upcoming reopening of businesses and schools , but rely on many medical , biological , and en - gineering factors . This study introduced two new indices into the popular while perfect - mixing - based Wells - Riley model for predicting airborne virus related infection probability – the underlying reasons for keeping adequate social distance and space ventilation . The distance index P d can be obtained by theoretical analysis on droplet distribution and transmission from human respiration activities , and the ventilation index E z represents the system - dependent air distribution efficiency in a space . The study indicated that 1 . 6−3 . 0m ( 5 . 2 – 9 . 8ft ) is the safe social distance when considering aerosol transmission of exhaled large droplets from talking , while the distance can be up to 8 . 2m ( 26ft ) if taking into account of all droplets under calm air environment . Because of unknown dose response to COVID - 19 , the model used one actual pandemic case to calibrate the infectious dose ( quantum of infection ) , which was then verified by a number of other existing cases with short exposure time ( hours ) . Projections using the validated model for a variety of scenarios including transportation vehicles and building spaces illustrated that ( 1 ) increasing social distance ( e . g . , halving occupancy density ) can significantly reduce the infection rate ( 20 – 40 % ) during the first 30min even under current ventilation practices ; ( 2 ) minimum ventilation or fresh air requirement should vary with distancing condition , exposure time , and ef - fectiveness of air distribution systems . 1 . Introduction The outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) rapidly spread over 215 countries , areas or territories , impacting every aspect of human life . As of May 1 , 2020 , more than 3 , 272 , 200 cases of COVID - 19 had been confirmed , including over 230 , 100 reported deaths ( WHO , 2020b ) . Similar to all respiratory infectious diseases , the ongoing COVID - 19 pandemic warns that close contact should be avoided on account of virus transmission via droplet and airborne routes by re - spiratory activities ( CDC , 2020a ; CIDRAP , 2020 ; Peng , Xu , & Li , 2020 ; Radio , 2020 ; S , M . A . , K , S . , K , & A . , 2020 ; Ta - Chih , Hsiao - Chi , & Stephen , 2020 ; WHO , 2020a ) . The virus spreads through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs , sneezes , or talks ( CDC , 2020a ) . Social distancing , also called “physical distancing” , means keeping space between anyone and others outside of their homes . Many countries ( Richard & Horizon , 2020 ) , such as Australia ( Australian Government , D . o . H . , 2020a , 2020b ) , Italy ( Giordano , Blanchini , & Bruno , 2020 ) , England ( Liverpool , 2020 ) , and America ( Prevention , 2019 , 2020 ) have implemented restrictions on social ac - tivities ; and researchers ( Aderibigbe , 2020 ; Ashwin & Shantal , 2020 ; CMAJ , 2020 ; Ginger , Jay , Benoit , & Eric , 2020 ; Mahase , 2020 ; Morawska , Lidia , & Junji , 2020 ; Muddasani , Housholder , Fleischer , B , & A . , 2020 ; Qazi , Javaria , & Khulla , 2020 ; Setti , Auid - Orcid , Passarini , & Auid - Orcid , 2020 ; Zhang , Litvinova , & Liang , 2020 ) suggested in - creasing social distance to alleviate the spread of COVID - 19 . Some studies recommended ( CDC , 2020b ) that at least 2 m ( 6 feet ) ( about 2 arm’s length ) should be kept from others , while others believed that 6 feet or 2 m may not be adequate during this COVID - 19 outbreak ( Setti et al . , 2020 ) . Social distancing avoids the direct contacts among people and also reduces the potential cross - transmission of virus - carrying droplets from human respiration – two primary mechanisms for respiratory infection . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . scs . 2020 . 102390 Received 11 June 2020 ; Received in revised form 8 July 2020 ; Accepted 10 July 2020 ⁎ Corresponding author .

All rights reserved . T A few studies can be found in literature exploring droplet transmission trajectories through human respiratory behaviors including talking , eating , coughing , and sneezing . Some studies believed the number of pathogens of respiratory infectious diseases to be associated with dro - plet size , where large droplets were the main objects carrying micro - organisms generated from the infected person ( Christian , Loutfy , & McDonald , 2004 ; Julia , RN , & MN , 1996 ; Mangili & Gendreau , 2005 ; Wells , 1934 ) . Other studies suspected that small droplets / particles in the form of nucleus may disperse much farther ( called “airborne” ) . It was broadly debated regarding “how far can respiratory droplets transfer” and “what is the safe social distance” . The question is indeed complicated because it not only concerns momentum transmission , but also relates to mass exchange with surrounding air such as by eva - poration . It becomes more sophisticated when medical and biological factors are considered ( e . g . , infectious dose ) along with the engineering factors . The critical size of large droplets is a function of many physical parameters , including ambient air temperature , relative humidity , ve - locity , etc . Evaporation effect should be taken into account to predict precise transmission distance of droplets by human respiration . Social distancing also tightly interacts with ventilation , both amount ( rate ) and effectiveness . Indoor ventilation is highly associated with the risk of respiratory infectious disease ( Nielsen , Winther , & Buus , 2008 ; WHO , 2009 ; Yang , Sekhar , & Cheong , 2015 ) . Adequate ventila - tion ( rate ) is mandatory to reduce the risk of infection , such as for SARS ( Jiang , Zhao , & Li , 2009 ) , in confined spaces , especially in public transportations , large / open offices , stores , restaurants , and so on . It is thus critical to investigate the relationships among social distance , minimum ventilation rate , and probability of infection ( PI ) , in order to control the PI to be less than the control target such as 2 % . This study introduced two new indices into the popular while per - fect - mixing - based Wells - Riley ( WR ) model to quantify the impacts from social distance and ventilation effectiveness to the PI . The distance index P d ( % ) was obtained by theoretical analysis on droplet distribu - tion and transmission during talking ; and expressed in the form of droplet disperse distance fitted from experimental data . The ventilation index E z represents the system - dependent air distribution efficiency in a space , as illustrated in the ASHRAE standard . This study calibrated the infective quantum q in the WR model using one real pandemic case and verified the modified model by comparing predicted and actual infec - tion rates for other existing cases . The study further projected the PI for a variety of confined environments with different occupancy densities . Ventilation rate and effectiveness were varied and tested to achieve the targeted 2 % infection rate with extended indoor time in different spaces . 2 . Methods 2 . 1 . Distribution and transmission model of exhaled droplets Quite a few studies have investigated the number and size of dro - plets of saliva and other secretions from respiratory activities ( Duguid , 1945 ; Fennelly , Martyny , Kayte , Fulton , & Ian , 2004 ; Hamburger & Robertson , 1948 ; Jennison & M . W , 1942 ; Loudon & Roberts , 1967 ; Papineni & Rosenthal , 1997 ) . The actual size distribution of droplets depends on many parameters such as the exhaled air velocity , the viscosity of the fluid , and the flow path ( i . e . , through nose , mouth , or both ) ( Barker et al . , 2001 ) . This study analyzed the statistics and dis - tributions of droplets in both size and number during normal talking using field experimental data ( Xie , Li , & Sun , 2009 ) . Several classical theoretical models and field measurement data were reviewed . One systematical laboratory study was chose to analyze the distributions of exhaled droplets during talking activity ( Xie et al . , 2009 ) , which were consistent with previous studies ( Loudon & Roberts , 1967 ; Xie et al . , 2009 ) . Experimental studies in literature mostly counted the spread droplet sizes and numbers , and some visualized trajectories , but did not provide quantitative distance tests and correlations . Fig . 1 shows the analyzed distribution of sizes , numbers and cumulative probabilities of respiratory droplets when subjects were talking . There were about 5 , 318 droplets during this talking activity and the diameters ranged from 0 to 1500 μm . Among these , the droplets with diameter of 50−75 μm account for the largest percentage of the total emission , about 28 % . Droplets with diameter below 10 μm and above 500 μm only accounted for 0 . 5 % and 0 . 1 % , respectively . The transmission distances of droplets can be calculated and ana - lyzed based on their characteristics of size and number . To simplify the falling and evaporation analysis of the droplets , the study firstly hy - pothesized a single free - falling particle following the Stokes Law to obtain the falling velocity v t ( m / s ) by balancing the drag force , gravity and buoyancy ( Robinson , James , & Rodrigo , 2016 ) , as seen in Eqs . ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) . = + 4 3 r g 4 3 r g 6 µrv 3 3 ' t ( 1 ) where , µ is the dynamic viscosity of airflow ( Pa·s ) , r is the radius of particle ( m ) , ρ is the particle density ( kg / m 3 ) and ρ’ is the density of flow medium ( air , kg / m 3 ) , g is the gravitational acceleration ( m / s 2 ) . When Re < 2 , in the Stokes zone , the particle terminal falling velocity , falling time , and horizontal travel distance can be obtained , respec - tively : = v 2 ( - ) gr 9µ t ' 2 ( 2 ) = t H v t ( 3 ) = × d u t 0 ( 4 ) The initial height ( H ) of this particle was set as 1 . 5 m , which is the typical height of standing person mouth , and the falling time t ( s ) can be calculated by Eq . ( 3 ) . The horizontal transmission distance d can be attained with a given initial velocity u 0 ( m / s ) multiplying with the falling time t ( Eq . ( 4 ) ) . Most particles can reach the terminal velocity quickly ( compared to the total falling time ) and then fall under this constant speed . In this analysis , the initial temperature of the re - spiratory droplets was set at 33 °C ( Hoppe , 1981 ) , and the air tem - perature was at 20 °C ( Wells , 1934 ) . The average u 0 for talking was 5 m / s ( Xie , Li , & Chwang , 2007 ) . When evaporation is considered , the droplet size alters during the falling and transmission , and thus the transmitted distance also changes . Eq . ( 5 ) is often used to determine the evaporation time t e ( ms ) during an actual water droplet falling , where D 0 ( μm ) is the initial diameter of a droplet and λ ( μm 2 / ms ) is the evaporation factor that is almost constant ( Lui & Zhai , 2007 ) under typical room conditions Fig . 1 .

Zhai Sustainable Cities and Society 62 ( 2020 ) 102390 2 = D D t 2 02 e ( 5 ) The actual trajectory , therefore , is related to the droplet size D that is varying with t during the falling process . Eq . ( 6 ) represents the cor - rected falling velocity v t ( m / s ) with consideration of evaporation . The falling time t can be recalculated using the integral Eq . ( 7 ) , where H is the vertical transmission distance of 1 . 5 m . The final horizontal trans - mission distance was then obtained by using Eq . ( 4 ) . = v 2 ( - ) g ( r - 4 t ) 9µ t ' 02 ( 6 ) = H vdt t ( 7 ) For the particles of different sizes ( i . e . , different masses ) , Eqs . ( 8 ) and ( 9 ) present the mass percentages of different transmission dis - tances , with the assumption of three particle sizes as demonstration ( Fig . 2 ) . The percentage of transmission distance varies from 0 % , when beyond the maximum distance d 1 , to 100 % , when below the minimum distance d 3 . The same theoretical analysis process can be applied to the cases with actual droplet distributions from experiments . = + + = + + M M M M D 6 N D 6 N D 6 N 1 2 3 13 1 23 2 33 3 ( 8 ) > = > > = > > = + > = + + = P ( d d ) 0 % ; P ( d d d ) M M ; P ( d d d ) M M M ; P ( d d ) M M M M 100 % 1 1 2 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 ( 9 ) where M ( mg ) is the total mass of the droplets , M i ( i = 1 , 2 , 3 ) is the mass of the droplets with the diameter of D i ( μm ) , N i ( i = 1 , 2 , 3 ) is the number of droplets with D i , d i ( i = 1 , 2 , 3 , m ) is the horizontal trans - mission distance of droplets with D i . 2 . 2 . Role of social distance and development of social distance index P d This study built the relationship between the statistical probability of droplets in different sizes and their transmission distances based on the analysis of distribution and transmission of the experimental ex - haled droplets . The social distance index P d ( % ) is expressed as a function of distance d ( m ) , where P d is a cumulative percentage or probability ( Eq . ( 9 ) ) and its upper limit is 100 % . Principally , P d in - creases with decrease of transmission distance that is negatively related to droplet size . The study then calculated the transmission distance d according to Eqs . ( 1 ) – ( 4 ) , as seen in Fig . 3 . Analytically , the particle with diameter of 5 μm could spread up to 2500 m , and the larger the particles the shorter the transmission distance . For the droplets with diameter of above 1000 μm , the distance was close to 0 m . The evaporation effect of droplets during the transmission was not considered in the calculation of transmission distance shown in Fig . 3 . As described earlier , changes in droplet size due to evaporation are calculated with Eq . ( 5 ) . It was found that 92 μm was the critical dia - meter to distinguish the droplet final location . It resulted in a complete evaporation of the droplets with small sizes ( D < 92 μm ) into the air before they landed on the ground . These evaporated droplets turned into droplet nucleus and stayed in the air for a longer time . However , because of the low mass percentage of droplets with these smaller sizes and inconclusive conclusions on airborne nature and risk impacts of COVID - 19 , this study focused on those larger droplets , which would land on ground before the full evaporation . Under the influence of evaporation , the initial trajectory of a droplet altered , where the transmission distance would be longer than before owing to the gradual reduction of droplet size . The final hor - izontal transmission distance of droplets after evaporation should be recalculated using Eqs . ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) . The relationship of this distance and the exposure mass percentage ( probability ) based on droplet distribu - tion was then obtained by curve fitting , as seen in Fig . 4 . The social distance index P d is expressed as a function of distance , as shown in Eq . ( 10 ) , where the R 2 = 0 . 9189 . = + P ( 18 . 19ln ( d ) 43 . 276 ) / 100 d ( 10 ) Fig . 5 compares the falling time of droplets of different sizes with and without evaporation . The difference of the falling time with and without evaporation was found among the droplets with the diameter of 100−200 μm . The disparity decreases with the increase of droplet size , and there is almost no difference when the diameter is above 150 μm . Small droplets are more affected by evaporation , but the probability of social distance P d depends more on the droplets with large diameters . Eq . ( 10 ) , hence , can be used with reasonable accuracy . 2 . 3 . Ventilation factor - air distribution effectiveness E Z For a confined space or zone , different ventilation systems or modes Fig . 2 .

Among all of the air distribution configurations , ceiling supply of cool air and ceiling supply of warm air with floor return are often taken as the base cases for air distribution evaluation , respectively , with as - signment 1 . 0 of ventilation factor in ASHRAE 62 . 1 ( ASHRAE , 2019 ) . This value is called air distribution effectiveness E z and it ranges from 0 . 5 , where makeup supply outlet is located less than half the length of the space from the exhaust , return , or both , to 1 . 5 with stratified air distribution systems or personalized ventilation system , as summarized in Table 1 . In the outbreak of respiratory diseases such as COVID - 19 , this ventilation factor is particularly important for the assessment of effective ventilation in confined spaces . Computational fluid dynamics ( CFD ) techniques can be used to simulate individual cases and obtain more accurate and case - specific Ez . 3 . Modified Wells – Riley model The Wells - Riley model is one of the most classic and popular models to predict the infection risk ( Riley , Murphy , & Riley , 1978 ; Wells , 1955 ) , as shown in Eq . ( 11 ) . = = P C S 1 - exp ( - Iqpt Q ) I ( 11 ) where P I is the probability of infection ( risk ) , C is the number of cases to develop infection , S is the number of susceptible , I is the number of source patients ( infector ) , p is the pulmonary ventilation rate of each susceptible individual ( m 3 / s ) ( p = 0 . 3 m 3 / h when people sits or con - ducts light indoor activities ( Duan , Zhao , & Wang , 2013 ) ) , Q is the room ventilation rate ( m 3 / s ) ; q is the quantum generation rate produced by one infector ( quantum / s ) , and t is the exposure time ( s ) . The original Wells – Riley model considered the ventilation rate as the only influen - cing factor to the infection risk , by assuming the space is well - mixed . The quantum q is tightly related to specific respiratory infectious diseases , as well as vulnerability of susceptible group in study . Since there is no uniform and broadly accepted value of q for COVID - 19 in worldwide , one way to identify q is to perform a reverse calculation based on actual cases , where the other factors were known or could be determined . After several trial calculations , this study found that the q value varies largely in different spaces with different population den - sities and ventilation systems . Two important indices described above , P d and E z , were thus in - troduced into the Wells - Riley model , as presented in Eq . ( 12 ) . = = P C S 1 - exp ( - P Iqpt Q E ) I d z ( 12 ) The study firstly attempted to calibrate the q value in the model by using one real pandemic case with other known parameters , and then verified this modified model with other existing cases . The study then applied this modified model to predict the infection risk of COVID - 19 in a variety of confined scenarios with different occupation densities , and to investigate the required minimum ventilation rate for these spaces to achieve the targeted 2 % infection probability . 4 . Calibration and verification of the modified model This study has collected critical data from several actual pandemic cases . The relevant parameters of these cases were listed in Table 2 . Antibody tests from Stanford University ( Nature , 2020 ) conducted in Santa Clara County , California , suggested that coronavirus infection rate may be 2 . 5 – 4 . 2 % vastly exceeding official counts . Preliminary findings from the tests in Hoosiers , Indiana , also showed a general Fig . 5 . The falling time of droplets of different sizes with and without eva - poration .

According to these findings , the bus in Hunan - 1 was chosen as a representative case in terms of the initial infection rate ( 2 . 17 % ) , the stay duration , and the occupant number . The infective quantum q in the modified model was subsequently ca - librated by this case . The distance between two passengers on this bus was estimated to be 1 . 05 m based on the design regulation ( GB 9673 - 1996 1996 ) and the actual occupancy rate against the seat design ; and the P d value on this bus was calculated to be 42 . 4 % . The air distribution on the bus was set as ceiling supply and floor return according to the bus design standard , and the ventilation effectiveness index E z was 1 . 0 . The ventilation rate ( clean air ) was obtained according to the actual situation in references ( Jian , Ming , & Bo , 2000 ; Tang , Ke , & Gong , 2011 ) . As a result , with the known percentage of infection ( 18 % ) after 2 - h travel / exposure time , the value of q was calculated to be 0 . 238 , where the unit of q was quantum / s . The q value was then kept as a constant to project the in - fection probability and the required ventilation rate for similar confined spaces . The related exposure parameters for all these cases , including d , P d , E z , were analyzed and calculated . Fig . 6 shows the infection probability projected by the modified model with their own input parameters , compared against the actual infection probability in Table 2 . The comparison reveals a reasonable accuracy of the model prediction for most actual cases . The lowest deviation of the prediction from the actual value was 2 . 2 % . The model presents a good capability for predicting the infection risk . However , I varied randomly from case to case , which lead to significant uncertainly in the predicted infection probability due to the limited sampling cases . This study attempted to explore the sensitivity of PI to the variable initial infection by introducing the initial infection rate B ( = I / N , where N is the total number of passengers / occupants ) . The modified model can be expressed as Eq . ( 13 ) . = = P C S 1 - exp ( - P Bqpt E Q / N ) I d z ( 13 ) Table 2 shows that the initial infection rate B varies from 1 . 47 % to 8 . 33 % , so the sample standard deviation ( root - mean - square error ) of B is 3 . 3 % and the T - score of these samples is 36 % . The projection range of PI can be estimated by introducing ±3 . 3 % uncertainty of initial B into the Eq . ( 13 ) . The uncertainty range of PI due to B , for the bus in Hunan - 2 , China after 60 min exposure , the bus in Ningbo , China after 4 h exposure , and the airplane in Iran after 6 . 5 h exposure was 3 . 8 – 33 . 8 % , 0 – 70 . 6 % and 0 – 73 . 7 % , respectively . The deviations of the pre - dictions from the actual values in the three verification cases were within the error range . Attributed to the scarce sample size in this study ( and the high randomness of B in individual cases ) , the uncertainty range of projected PI may seem large . But modeling the trend of in - fection using average B in general population by Eq .

Upon the findings from the ex - isting antibody tests , this study applied the estimated population in - fection rate 2 . 8 % as the initial infection rate B in the model to project the infection probability in the following case analysis . Due to the fact that many other influential factors may likely in - volve in disease transmission in long - term exposure , such as wider ac - tivity spaces and more chances for direct body and surface contacts , this study would consider that this model is more appropriate for predicting infection risks in confined spaces with relative shorter exposure time ( in hours ) , such as for public transportation , classroom , office , store , and restaurant . 5 . Applications and implications of the modified model This study utilized the modified model to predict the infection risks in typical confined spaces , including bus , air cabin , subway , high - speed train , classroom , office , and restaurant . The associated parameters and designed ventilation rate ( required minimum fresh air rate , m 3 / h∙p ) were determined according to respective standards as listed in Table 3 . The research calculated the distance index P d using Eq . ( 10 ) with both the actual social distance and the double social distance ( where the occupancy ratio is 50 % ) . The ventilation effectiveness E z was set as 0 . 8 – 1 . 0 in accordance with specific air distribution forms . Fig . 7 shows the predicted probability of infection due to COVID - 19 in representative confined environments with 100 % and 50 % occu - pancy ratio . All the infection probability eventually approached to 1 ( 100 % ) with long enough exposure time . The results illustrate that the risk of infection in public bus was the highest among all the public transportation vehicles . This is consistent with the actual situation due to the lower air distribution effectiveness , lower fresh air rate , and higher occupancy density . The risk in aircraft cabin was the lowest , where the combined index of distance and ventilation P d / ( E z ∙ Q / N ) was the smallest . It should be noted that this finding was based on the re - quired minimum ventilation rate for each application . The total venti - lation rate ( including both fresh air and cleaned recirculated air ) for land transportation could be much more than aircraft ( that is more restricted ) , which might reduce the infection risk . By reducing the occupancy ratio by 50 % , the infection risk could be decreased effectively during the same exposure time period with the same ventilation . For most of the tested transportations , the infection probability at the end of the first 30 min can be reduced by 18 . 8 – 28 . 2 % , while in confined building spaces , the reduction can be 28 . 6 – 40 . 6 % . Table 4 listed the projected infection probability for staying in various spaces with 100 % and 50 % occupancy ratio . The occupying / exposure time was determined by experienced estimation . For instance , people spend the most and least continuous time , respectively , in office ( 4 h ) and commuter bus / subway ( 30 min ) . As anticipated , infection risk as - suredly increases with the exposure time , but is also greatly affected by ventilation and social distancing . For example , staying on a high - speed train for 3 h produces a higher PI than staying in an office for 4 h . Reducing the occupancy density by 50 % can reduce the infected risk by 9 . 1 % for high - speed train and 9 . 6 % for office , while the reduction of PI on public bus and subway is , respectively , 3 . 2 % and 2 . 5 % after 30 - minute time duration . It was noted that the infection probability varied linearly with time during the first 30 - minutes exposure in all of the studied spaces . Further analysis illustrates that the infection risk shows a clear linear dependence to the exposure time , respectively , during the first 200 min ( about 3 . 3 h ) for the long bus , 240 min ( 4 h ) for the air cabin , 110 min ( 1 . 8 h ) for the public bus , 140 min ( 2 . 3 h ) for the subway , 240 min ( 4 h ) for the high speed train , 360 min ( 6 h ) for the office , 120 min ( 2 h ) for the classroom , and 180 min ( 3 h ) . In other words , during these time periods , the infection risk increases linearly with occupying time . People usually spend more time inside buildings and transportations than outside , therefore social distancing ( occupancy ratio ) and ventilation play an important role in controlling the outbreak T a b l e 3 P a r a m e t e r s o f t y p i c a l c o n fi n e d s p a c e s c e n a r i o s .

Although social distancing is effective in reducing the risk of in - fection , to control the PI to a lower level ( for example , 2 % ) requires adequate ventilation rate to dilute the contaminants from infectors . Social distancing can impact the required ventilation rate . Fig . 8 shows the requested minimum ventilation rate in order to achieve the targeted infection probability goal of 2 % in typical spaces with different occu - pancy densities ( 100 % , 75 % , 50 % and 25 % ) . The E z values were derived from Table 3 , representing the conventional design conditions . As a higher air distribution effectiveness may correspond to a less ventilation rate need , an occupancy ratio of 50 % with a higher E z of 1 . 4 ( for personalized ventilation ) was also tested and compared . As ex - pected , the requested minimum ventilation rate increases proportion - ally with the length of exposure time . Increasing social distance ( i . e . , reducing the occupancy ratio ) can significantly reduce the required ventilation rate . For instance , for office , the required ventilation rate can be reduced by more than four fifth when the occupancy ratio re - duced to 25 % at the first 30 - minute exposure . For public bus with the highest infection risk , the required ventilation rate can be reduced by 40 % . Under the scenarios of 25 – 50 % occupancy ratio or 50 % occu - pancy ratio with a higher E z of 1 . 4 , the required ventilation rate for office was even below the conventional minimum fresh air ( 30 m 3 / ( h∙p ) ) requirement in the standard . For all transportations and other public buildings , the standard - required minimum fresh air flow rate is not enough to achieve the set risk mitigation goal ( PI < 2 % ) , even with lower occupancy ratio and higher ventilation effectiveness . The sole practical approach is to increase the ventilation rate . Fig . 8 also shows that with a 4 - h exposure time in office , the required ventilation rate decreased from 438 . 2 m 3 / ( h∙p ) to 77 . 8 m 3 / ( h∙p ) ( about 82 % reduction ) to achieve the same infection probability target of < 2 % , when the occupancy ratio was reduced to 25 % . Increasing the ventilation ef - fectiveness to a higher level ( i . e . , with personalized ventilation at E z = 1 . 4 ) also had a great impact on the required ventilation rate , especially for restaurant , public bus and subway , where the required ventilation rates with 50 % occupancy ratio were even lower than those with 25 % occupancy ratio and E z = 1 . In this situation , the required minimum ventilation rate during the first 30 min exposure in most of the studied spaces was lower than 50 m 3 / ( h∙p ) – a ventilation rate that can be achieved by most current ventilation systems without major renovation . 6 . Discussion The projected probability of infection ( PI ) demonstrates that social distancing and ventilation play an important role in preventing the risk of COVID - 19 outbreak . The minimum safe distance for regular social activities ( e . g . , breathing and talking ) was 1 . 6−3 m ( 5 . 2 – 9 . 8 ft ) , while the maximum transmission distance could be up to 8 . 2 m ( 26 ft ) and its Fig . 7 .

A number of studies have articulated that the COVID - 19 virus is airborne ( Morawska et al . , 2020 ; Q , Y . , W , N . , Z , & W . , 2020 ; Setti et al . , 2020 ) . Respiratory droplets evaporate and their diameters thus become small enough to suspend in the air in the form of droplet nucleus . The nucleus can stay in the air for a long time , and if they carry the virus , they will undoubtedly jeopardize the susceptible population . However , the mechanism of airborne transmission and infection is complex and need further investigation . Owing to the low percentage of quality and number of small droplets , which might evaporate into the air and be - come nucleus before their deposition , this study focused on the primary risk through the droplet route as defined by WHO and US CDC . The convection flow around human body is also an important factor im - pacting the droplets transmission ( Liu , Li , & Nielsen , 2017 ; Yang , Yang , & Zhao , 2016 ) , but to simplify the transmission model , this factor was not taken into account . Besides , the risk from physical / surface contact is still unclear and not included in this study . It is necessary and va - luable to propose a comprehensive scheme that can evaluate the risk from all possible routes . A number of studies have suggested the social distance based on the exhaled droplets transmission . A 1 m ( 3 feet ) seperation was suggested for public activities to prevent the virus spreading carried by larged droplets in previous studies ( WHO , 2014 ) . However , studies demon - strated that 1 m is not enough for infection controlling . They proposed that 2−6 m is the safe distance because > 0 . 1 mm droplets may eva - porate or fall to a surface within 2 m , depending on size , air humidity and temperature , but droplets can reach distances as far as 6 m away when coughing or sneezing with spray velocity up to 10−50 m / s ( Bjørn & Nielsen , 2002 ; Xie et al . , 2007 ) . With the outbreaking of COVID - 19 , a study reported that droplets can travel up to eight meters ( 23 – 27 feet ) in the case of a sneeze , which means even small droplets may spread throughout a room ( Bourouiba , 2020 ) . These statements are based on the CFD simulation or laboratory tests . This study attempeted to ana - lyze the droplets falling and transmission in theoretically by con - sidering the gravity , friction , buoyancy lift and the evaporation si - multaneously . Instead of displaying the transmission distance for droplets with different sizes seperately , this study built the relationship of transmission distance with the expoure probability based on mass stastistics . It reveals the risk of virus spreading by droplets of different sizes . The calibration of the modified Wells - Riley model provided a practical infective quantum q ( 0 . 238 , quantum / s ) for COVID - 19 based on statistics and very limited case studies . Findings from verification on real cases indicated that the modified model with introduction of dis - tance and ventilation indices ( P d and E z ) had a reasonable accuracy of prediction . Based on a limited number of real cases , the lowest devia - tion of the prediction from the actual value was 2 . 2 % , and the devia - tions of the projected PIs for the verification cases were within the uncertainty range . The case used to calibrate the model had an initial infection rate ( 2 . 17 % ) that was close to the announced population infection rate ( 2 . 8 % ) from the antibody tests . The sensitivity studies show that 20 – 40 % reduction of infection risk would occur at the first 30 min of occupancy if the occupancy rate was reduced by 50 % in confined spaces . This reconfirms the efficacy of social distancing on mitigating infection risks . The combination of proper social distance and high ventilation effectiveness can sig - nificantly reduce the required minimum ventilation rate to the range that can be achieved by current mechanical systems . As a result , in - creasing social distance combined with high ventilation effectiveness should be considered as two effective manners to deliver ventilation and prevent COVID - 19 cross - infection . There are several limitations of this study . This study has several limitations . First , the modified model was developed in the case of virus Fig . 8 . The requested ventilation rate for controlling the low infected probability . C . Sun and Z . Zhai Sustainable Cities and Society 62 ( 2020 ) 102390 8 transmission by droplet . In fact , direct contact has been confirmed as another significant path to spread virus . Besides , the droplet nuclei is also considered as a potential carrier of respiratory virus . Secondly , the initial infection probability for calibration was hypothesized as 2 . 8 % synthesizing the antibody test results and one real vehicle case in this study , which may bring the deviation of the projected infection prob - ability and related required minimum ventilation rate . Thirdly , social distance in practical condition is unknown and the average value based on the space area and passengers’ number was hypothesized and em - ployed . This estimation method may present its limitation for spaces with strong population mobility or irregular space shape in practice . 7 . Conclusion This paper developed and introduces two critical indices – social distance probability P d and ventilation effectiveness E z – into the Wells - Riley model to predict the infection probability of COVID - 19 . These two indices provide the quantitative evaluation of impacts of social dis - tancing and ventilation effectiveness on respiratory disease infection risk . The study calibrated the infective quantum q in the model using one actual pandemic case and verified the modified model with other existing cases , which showed the reasonable accuracy of the model prediction for confined spaces . The projected infection probability in typical indoor environments using this modified model illustrated that social distancing had a great positive impact on decreasing both the infection risk and the required minimum ventilation rate so as to achieve the targeted infection probability . This study presents a pro - mising prediction model for airborne virus in confined spaces that can quantify the influences of occupancy density , ventilation , and exposure time on infection probability .
