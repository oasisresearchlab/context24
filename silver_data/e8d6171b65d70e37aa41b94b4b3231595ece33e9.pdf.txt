Equal amounts of GST - fusion proteins were used in all experiments ( Figure 2B ) . Previously , we used the cortactin SH3 domain fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain ( GAL4 DNA BD / SH3 ) To determine whether the cortactin and WIP interac - tion was direct , binding assays were performed with ( Figure 1A , top ) in a yeast two - hybrid screen to identify interactingproteinsfromarathippocampalcDNAlibrary purified 6xHis - tagged WIP ( Figure 2C ) and purified GST - cortactin .

Equimolar amounts of GST - cortactin ( 200 nM / L ) or GST - Nck ( 200 nM / L ) fusion proteins were incubated with 600 (cid:4) g HEK293 cell lysate expressing FLAG - WIP or 25 nM 6xHis - WIP . Following incubation for 30 min , bound complexes were separated by SDS - PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose , and WIP binding was determined by Western blotting with either M5 anti - FLAG ( top ) or anti - 6xHis ( bottom ) monoclonal antibodies .

Consistent with their inability to interact with cortactin , FLAG - WIP ( 237 ) and FLAG - WIP ( (cid:5) 110 – 170 ) or FLAG - WIP variants , and the localization of cortactin and FLAG - WIP was determined by immunostaining . lack all or part of the proline - rich region of WIP that defines clone SH3 - 4 ( amino acids 136 – 205 ) , isolated REF52 cells , a cell line used for immunofluorescent anal - ysis of structures at the cell periphery , were grown in from the yeast two - hybrid assay . Therefore , these data confirm the interaction of cortactin and WIP in vivo and serum , and anti - FLAG immunostaining revealed that full - length FLAG - WIP localized to a perinuclear region define the proline - rich region of WIP as the binding re - gion for the cortactin SH3 domain . and to regions of membrane ruffling at the cell periphery ( Figure 4A ) . This localization was coincident with endog - enous cortactin staining ( Figure 4B ) , as determined by Cortactin and WIP Colocalize at the Cell Periphery image merging ( Figure 4C ) . A similar pattern of staining In adherent cells , cortactin localizes to cortical actin structures at the cell membrane ( e . g . , lamellipodia ) [ 5 ] . was observed in cells expressing FLAG - WIP ( 112 ) ( Fig - Cortactin Interacts with WIP 387 Figure 3 .

Cells were incubated overnight in the presence of 10 % FBS , trypsinized , and replated on 1 . 5 (cid:4) g / ml fibronectin for 4 hr prior to fixation . ( B , E , H , and K ) Cells were immunostained for endogenous cortactin by using an anti - cortactin N - term polyclonal antibody ( (cid:1) cortactin ) . ( A , D , G , and J ) FLAG - tagged WIP proteins were visualized with the anti - FLAG M5 monoclonal antibody ( (cid:1) FLAG ) .

Thus , consistent with data for WASp family proteins , the addition of actin filaments ( Figure 5B ) . We next sought to determine whether the increased decreases the lag time of cortactin - mediated activation of Arp2 / 3 complex . actin polymerization induced by WIP was dependent on the interaction between cortactin and WIP . The addition Cortactin inhibits the debranching of actin filament networks in vitro [ 7 ] . To determine how WIP affects cor - of cortactin W525K and Arp2 / 3 complex induced actin nucleation in a manner similar to that of full - length wild - tactin - mediated stabilization of actin branches , we per - formed an in vitro actin debranching assay . Alone , WIP type cortactin ( Figure 5C ) . However , WIP was not able to accelerate actin nucleation in the presence of cortactin has no effect on actin debranching ( Figure 5E ) . Also , the addition of WIP does not affect the ability of cortactin to W525K and Arp2 / 3 complex , and it exhibited less effi - cient actin polymerization ( Figure 5C ) . Likewise , in the stabilize actin branches ( Figure 5E ) . These data indicate that inhibition of actin debranching by cortactin is not presence of the cortactin W22A mutant , which does not interact with or activate Arp2 / 3 complex [ 13 , 15 ] , WIP influenced by interaction with WIP . did not accelerate Arp2 / 3 complex activation .

WIP Increases the Efficiency of Cortactin - Stimulated Arp2 / 3 Complex Activation The effect of WIP on cortactin - mediated Arp2 / 3 activation was determined by fluorimetry with pyrene - labeled actin . ( A ) Purified Arp2 / 3 complex was incubated with recombinant wild - type cortactin in the absence or presence of recombinant WIP in polymeriza - tion buffer . Controls included a buffer control ( “actin” ) , WIP alone , cortactin alone , Arp2 / 3 complex alone , cortactin (cid:6) WIP , and WIP (cid:6) Arp2 / 3 complex , as indicated ( lower right ) . The GST - VCA fragment of N - WASp ( 200 nM ) incubated with Arp2 / 3 complex ( 50 nM ) was a positive control ( “VCA (cid:6) Arp” ) . ( B ) Increasing concentrations of WIP ( 50 – 400 nM ) induce a linear increase in the concentration of free barbed ends . The concentrations of free barbed ends were calculated from the slopes of the curves . The data points represent the average of duplicate determinations . ( C ) The ability of WIP to enhance Arp2 / 3 activation by cortactin requires an intact NTA and SH3 domain . Wild - type ( “FL” ) , W22A and W525K cortactin ( 200 nM ) , WIP ( 400 nM ) , Arp2 / 3 complex ( 50 nM ) , and monomeric actin ( 2 . 5 (cid:4) M ) were coincubated and analyzed by using the pyrene actin polymerization assay as described in ( A ) . ( D ) Actin filaments reduce the lag period for Arp2 / 3 complex activation by cortactin or cortactin (cid:6) WIP . Arp2 / 3 complex ( 50 nM ) , cortactin ( 200 nM ) , WIP ( 400 nM ) , and monomeric actin ( 2 . 5 (cid:4) M ) were coincubated in the absence or presence ( (cid:6) fil ) of 150 nM actin filaments by using the pyrene actin polymerization assay as described in ( A ) . Controls included a buffer control , WIP alone , cortactin alone , Arp2 / 3 complex alone , cortactin (cid:6) WIP , and WIP (cid:6) Arp2 / 3 complex , in either the absence ( no fil ) or presence ( (cid:6) fil ) of 150 nM actin filaments . ( E ) WIP does not affect cortactin - mediated stabilization of actin branches . An actin debranching assay was performed in which monomeric actin ( 4 (cid:4) M ) was added to the VCA domain ( 300 nM ) and Arp2 / 3 complex ( 25 nM ) and incubated for 6 min . The samples were incubated with rhodamine - phalloidin ( 0 min sample ) , cortactin ( 200 nM ) , WIP ( 400 nM ) , cortactin and WIP , or buffer . At various time points , samples were applied to glass coverslips , and percent branching was assessed by calculating the percent of actin filaments that were branched at each time point .
