Here , we report 21 the biochemical characterization of human cytoskeletal g – actin carrying mutation E334Q , a mutation 22 that leads to a hitherto unspecified non – muscle actinopathy . Following expression , purification , and 23 removal of linker and thymosin β4 tag sequences , the p . E334Q monomers show normal integration 24 into linear and branched actin filaments . The mutation does not affect thermal stability , actin filament 25 nucleation , elongation and turnover . Model building and normal mode analysis predict significant 26 differences in the interaction of p . E334Q – filaments with myosin motors and members of the 27 ADF / cofilin family of actin – binding proteins . Assays probing the interactions of p . E334Q – filaments with 28 human class 2 and class 5 myosin motor constructs show significant reductions in sliding velocity and 29 actin – affinity . E334Q differentially affects cofilin - mediated actin dynamics by increasing the rate of 30 cofilin - mediated de novo nucleation of actin filaments and decreasing the efficiency of cofilin - mediated 31 filament severing . Thus , it is likely that p . E334Q - mediated changes in myosin motor activity , as well as 32 filament turnover contribute to the observed disease phenotype . 33 34 35 3 Introduction 36 Cytoskeletal β – and g – actin are the basic building blocks of the actin cytoskeleton in human non – 37 muscle cells . The spatio – temporal regulation of these two actin isoforms , mediated by distinct actin – 38 binding proteins ( ABPs ) , drives the establishment and maintenance of specialized cytoskeletal 39 compartments that are defined by their network architecture and the presence of specific filamentous 40 actin – associated proteins ( Pollard , 2016 ; Plastino & Blanchoin , 2019 ) . The regulated ATP – dependent 41 turnover of these actin networks as well as the coordinated interplay of actin with network – specific 42 ABPs contribute to essential cellular processes like directed migration , adhesion , division and 43 mechanotransduction ( Ponti et al , 2004 ; Abercrombie et al , 1970 , 1971 ; Ridley et al , 2003 ; Pollard et 44 al , 2002 ; Lauffenburger & Horwitz , 1996 ) . 45 β – and g – actin differ by only four amino acids in the N – terminal region of the molecule but show 46 isoform – specific spatial organization in studies performed with monoclonal antibodies . In motile and 47 stationary cells , β – actin is found in contractile stress fibers and the cell periphery ( Dugina et al , 2009 ; 48 Latham et al , 2013 ; Dugina et al , 2015 ) . In contrast , g – actin localization is less static . During cell 49 movement , g – actin is recruited to the leading edge of the cell , resulting in an enrichment of the isoform 50 in the lamellipodium together with β – actin ( Dugina et al , 2009 ) . In non – moving cell states , g – actin is 51 co – localized with β – actin in stress fibers ( Dugina et al , 2009 ) . In order to reconcile the highly similar 52 protein sequences with the varying localization , several hypotheses on isoform regulation were put 53 forward . These include the preferential interaction of ABPs with a particular isoform depending on the 54 minor differences in the protein sequence , post – translational modifications as a means of isoform – 55 specific regulation , and differences in the translation speed of ACTB and ACTG1 , the genes encoding 56 cytoskeletal β – actin and g – actin ( Zhang et al , 2010 ; Vedula et al , 2017 ; Pavlyk et al , 2018 ; Müller et al , 57 2013 ) . 58 Diseases associated with heterozygous pathogenic variants in ACTB and ACTG1 are typically referred 59 to as non – muscle actinopathies . These include a spectrum of rare syndromes that manifest themselves 60 as more or less pronounced developmental disorders in patients ( Verloes et al , 2015 ; Di Donato et al , 61 2014 ; Latham et al , 2018 ; Rivière et al , 2012 ; Baraitser & Winter , 1988 ; Cuvertino et al , 2017 ) . 62 Baraitser – Winter – Cerebrontofacial – Syndrome ( BWCFF , ( Baraitser & Winter , 1988 ) ) is a condition that 63 affects the development of multiple organs , but particularly results in facial anomalies and brain 64 malformations . BWCFF occurs due to various missense mutations in ACTB or ACTG1 ( Verloes et al , 65 2015 ; Di Donato et al , 2014 ; Rivière et al , 2012 ; Di Donato et al , 2016 ) . BWCFF – patients show a 66 recognizable facial gestalt , with variants in ACTB generally resulting in a stronger facial phenotype than 67 mutations in ACTG1 ( Di Donato et al , 2014 ) . BWCFF – patients regularly suffer from cortical 68 malformations that lead to severe developmental and mental impairments . In addition , symptoms 69 such as hearing loss , dystonia , hypotonia and polydactyly occur with increased frequency ( Di Donato 70 et al , 2014 ; Rivière et al , 2012 ) . Variants in ACTB alone are responsible for two other well – defined 71 syndromes . ACTB – associated pleiotropic malformation syndrome and ACTB – associated syndromic 72 thrombocytopenia can be caused by single – point missense mutations , truncating mutations , 73 frameshift mutations or deletion ( Latham et al , 2018 ; Cuvertino et al , 2017 ) . These ACTB – associated 74 syndromes differ from BWCFF in that they cause only mild craniofacial malformations and 75 developmental disorders ( Cuvertino et al , 2017 ; Latham et al , 2018 ) . Selected single – point missense 76 mutations in ACTG1 lead to a non – syndromic form of hearing loss ( Rendtorff et al , 2006 ; van Wijk et 77 al , 2003 ; Yuan et al , 2016 ) . 78 4 How exactly mutations in the ubiquitously produced actin isoforms of the cytoskeleton lead to various 79 syndromes and mutation - specific symptoms remains unclear . Currently , four main disease 80 mechanisms are under discussion ( Greve et al , 2022 ; Costa et al , 2004 ) . First , mutations in the actin 81 isoform can lead to functional haploinsufficiency , where the produced molecule is either intrinsically 82 unstable and therefore degraded by the proteasome or unable to associate with other actin molecules 83 and thus unable to partake in the necessary steps involved in the dynamic remodeling of the actin 84 cytoskeleton . This results in a reduced amount of “active“ actin molecules , which cannot fully be 85 compensated for by the remaining allele ( Vang et al , 2005 ) . Second , the mutant protein is produced in 86 normal quantities and integrated into filaments but interferes with actin filament turnover ( Costa et 87 al , 2004 ) . Third , the mutation perturbs interactions with actin binding proteins , either by direct or 88 allosteric disturbance of actin – actin or actin – ABP interaction interfaces ( Greve et al , 2022 ; Hundt et al , 89 2014 ; Bryan et al , 2006 ; Müller et al , 2012 ) . Fourth , the mutant protein shows an increased propensity 90 for forming toxic rod – like oligomeric structures , which can potentially harm the cell ( Ilkovski et al , 91 2004 ; Schröder et al , 2004 ) . 92 Therefore , one of the significant challenges is elucidating the relationship between the disturbed 93 molecular mechanisms of the cell ' s actin dynamics and disease patterns observed in patients . In order 94 to achieve this , it is necessary to resolve the structure – function relationship of the various actin 95 mutations at the molecular level . Here , we report the biochemical characterization of p . E334Q , a 96 cytoskeletal g – actin variant , which causes a syndromic form of non – muscle actinopathy . Features 97 associated with the production of p . E334Q include mild facial anomalies and an abnormal gyral pattern 98 of the cerebral cortex ( Di Donato et al , 2016 ) . At four years ( age of diagnosis ) , a patient carrying this 99 mutation showed developmental delay and severe muscle hypotonia ( Di Donato et al , 2016 ) . Although 100 the patient was initially reported within the ACTG1 – associated BWCFF cohort , careful reassessment of 101 the phenotype revealed that the clinical phenotype cannot be classified as BWCFF and is therefore 102 assigned as an unclassified NMA . Structural analysis of the disease – causing mutation shows that 103 residue E334 is located in the hinge region of the actin molecule , which connects the two subdomain 104 pairs of the protein . The region’s flexibility and ability to act as a pivot point are essential for the 105 subdomain rearrangement when actin monomers polymerize into filaments ( Figure 1A ) . Furthermore , 106 E334 is part of a contact region on the F – actin surface that interacts with the so - called 107 cardiomyopathy – loop in the motor domain of cytoskeletal myosin isoforms and contributes to the 108 formation of the actin – cofilin complex ( Figure 3 ) . We present experimental evidence for the impact of 109 changes involving residue E334 with respect to productive interactions with cytoskeletal myosin 110 isoforms , actin polymerization dynamics , and the formation of stable actin - cofilin complexes . We show 111 that mutation E334Q does not adversely affect protein folding . The thermal stability of p . E334Q 112 resembles that of the wild – type protein , both as a monomer and following integration into filaments . 113 The mutant protein efficiently copolymerizes with wildtype ( WT ) monomers and integrates into linear 114 and branched filament networks . In contrast , the interaction of mutant filaments with non - muscle 115 myosin - 2A / C and myosin - 5A is strongly impaired , as shown by in vitro motility experiments and 116 solution kinetics . Furthermore , p . E334Q filaments are less susceptible to cofilin – mediated 117 disassembly , while monomers are more susceptible to cofilin – mediated nucleation . 118 119 Results 120 Production of cytoskeletal g – actin and its variant p . E334Q 121 5 We produced untagged cytoskeletal g – actin and its variant p . E334Q in insect cells , free of 122 contaminating endogenous S . frugiperda actin , using a method that was originally designed for the 123 production of toxic actin mutants in Dictyostelium discoideum and later adapted for use with the 124 baculovirus / Sf9 insect cell expression system ( Noguchi et al , 2007 ; Lu et al , 2015 ) . The monomeric actin 125 constructs were initially produced fused to the actin - monomer sequestering protein thymosin - β4 . 126 Purification of the fusion protein by immobilized metal affinity chromatography , followed by 127 chymotrypsin – mediated cleavage of C – terminal linker and tag sequences , results in homogeneous 128 protein without non – native residues . The method worked equally well for both WT and mutant actin . 129 Starting with 2 × 10 9 cells , typical yields ranged from 5 – 7 mg of purified protein for cytoskeletal g – actin 130 and p . E334Q ( N = 3 for WT and N = 4 for p . E334Q ) . 131 132 Impact of mutation E334Q on protein folding and thermal stability 133 Mutation – induced misfolding of actin has been identified as one of the main causes for the 134 development of actinopathies ( Bryan et al , 2006 ; Vang et al , 2005 ) . Residue E334 is located in the hinge 135 region , formed by residues 137 – 145 and 333 – 338 ( Figure 1A ) , which is strongly involved in the 136 structural reorganization of the monomer upon incorporation into a growing filament ( Dominguez & 137 Holmes , 2011 ) . Previous studies have shown that an intact hinge region is crucial for the interactions 138 with the eukaryotic chaperonin CCT / TriC and myosin ( Noguchi et al , 2012 ; McCormack et al , 2001b , 139 2001a ) . We first performed a DNase – I inhibition assay to analyze the effect of mutation E334Q on the 140 folding of the protein . Previous studies have shown that the activity of DNase I is only effectively 141 inhibited by correctly folded actin ( Schüler et al , 2000 ) . We observed a 10 % increase in the apparent 142 IC 50 – value of p . E334Q ( 25 . 7± 0 . 6 nM ) compared to the WT protein ( 22 . 7± 0 . 7 nM ) ( Figure 1B ) . This is 143 in good agreement with CD – spectroscopy results showing nearly identical secondary structure 144 compositions for WT and mutant proteins ( Suppl . Figure 1 ) . Thermal denaturation temperatures ( T M ) 145 analyzed by differential scanning fluorimetry ( DSF ) gave values of 56 . 77 ± 0 . 24°C and 56 . 19 ± 0 . 30°C 146 for monomeric WT actin and p . E334Q . The values obtained for WT and E334Q filaments were 65 . 00 ± 147 0 . 76°C and 64 . 83 ± 0 . 25°C , respectively ( Figure 1C , Table 1 ) . Overall , these results show that the mutant 148 actin is correctly folded and has comparable stability to the WT protein . 149 As the hinge region is in close proximity to the nucleotide – binding cleft , we examined a potential effect 150 of the mutation on the interaction with nucleotides and the turnover of ATP . Initial tests gave near 151 identical rates of 0 . 00089 ± 0 . 00005 s - 1 and 0 . 00088 ± 0 . 00004 s - 1 for the steady – state turnover of ATP 152 by filaments formed from cytoskeletal g – actin or the p . E334Q variant ( Table 1 ) . Next , we determined 153 the nucleotide dissociation rates k - T and k - D by monitoring the decrease in fluorescence amplitude 154 associated with the displacement of ε – ATP or ε – ADP after rapid mixing with a large excess of unlabeled 155 ATP . With p . E334Q - actin , we observed rates of k - T = 0 . 0972 ± 0 . 0019 s - 1 and k - D = 0 . 3199 ± 0 . 0027 s - 1 . 156 These rates are about 2 - fold and 1 . 5 - fold faster than those observed in experiments performed with 157 WT monomers ( k - T = 0 . 0473 ± 0 . 0013 s - 1 , k - D = 0 . 2155 ± 0 . 0017 s - 1 ( Figure 1D , Table 1 ) . The observed 158 nucleotide dissociation rates for human cytoskeletal g – actin are in good agreement with values 159 obtained for a mixture of pyrene - labeled cytoskeletal g – actin ( 15 % ) and β – actin ( 85 % ) purified from 160 human platelets in experiments performed at the same ionic strength ( De La Cruz & Sept , 2010 ) . 161 162 p . E334Q shows normal polymerization behavior and is efficiently integrated into 163 linear and branched actin structures 164 6 The regulated assembly and disassembly of filamentous actin drive various cellular processes , including 165 directed cell migration , adhesion and endocytosis . A slight conformational change of the actin 166 monomer accompanies the integration of a monomeric actin molecule into a growing filament . A small 167 change in the hinge region leading to a 12° to 13° rotation of the inner subdomain pair relative to the 168 outer subdomain pair results in a flatter actin molecule within the filament compared to the free actin 169 monomer ( Dominguez & Holmes , 2011 ; Oda et al , 2009 ) . Mutations in the hinge region can thus 170 potentially affect filament assembly by impairing the required structural reorganization of the 171 monomer , as it attaches to the growing filament end . TIRF microscopy – based tracking of the 172 polymerization of monomeric Atto – 655 – labeled WT or mutant actin in vitro revealed a small but 173 significant reduction in the elongation rate from 12 . 6 ± 0 . 3 nm s - 1 for WT to 11 . 1 ± 0 . 3 nm s - 1 for mutant 174 filaments ( Figure 2A , B ) . To detect any differences in nucleation efficiency , we determined the time - 175 dependent increase in the number of filaments ( Figure 2C ) . Aside from short - term fluctuations , the 176 linear increase in the number of filaments recorded for WT ( 0 . 039 ± 0 . 002 s – 1 ) and p . E334Q ( 0 . 041 ± 177 0 . 004 s – 1 ) was similar over the full 1000 s duration of the experiment . Overall , p . E334Q shows only a 178 mild polymerization defect . 179 Since actin polymerization in vivo is tightly regulated in a spatio – temporal manner by different ABPs , 180 we analyzed the interaction of p . E334Q with one of the key – regulators of actin polymerization , the 181 Arp2 / 3 complex ( Goley & Welch , 2006 ) . The Arp2 / 3 complex promotes the nucleation of new actin 182 filaments from the sides of existing filaments and caps their pointed ends . Thereby , it promotes the 183 formation of branched actin networks and contributes to essential processes that depend on the 184 dynamic remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton , such as cell migration , endocytosis , and organelle 185 positioning ( Nicholson - Dykstra et al , 2005 ; Mullins et al , 1998 ; Blanchoin et al , 2000 ; Loisel et al , 1999 ) . 186 The ability of p . E334Q to form branched actin networks was probed in TIRF microscopy – based 187 experiments in the presence of increasing concentrations of VCA – activated human Arp2 / 3 complex 188 ( Figure 2D ) . At the lowest Arp2 / 3 concentration used ( 0 . 01 nM ) , we observed the appearance of the 189 first branches after approximately 250 s . In the presence of 0 . 1 nM and 0 . 2 nM of the VCA - activated 190 Arp2 / 3 complex , mutant and WT actin continued forming branched networks with comparable branch 191 formation and branch elongation rates . Similar results were obtained with WT actin , mutant actin or 192 with 1 : 1 mixtures of WT and mutant actin , when we analyzed the effect of adding increasing 193 concentrations of VCA – activated human Arp2 / 3 in pyrene – actin based bulk – polymerization assays 194 ( Figure 2E , F ) . The results are summarized in Table 1 . 195 196 Impact of E334Q mutation on interactions with ADF / cofilin family proteins 197 Homology models of the complexes formed by human cofilin – 1 with filamentous cytoskeletal g – actin 198 and p . E334Q were generated to evaluate the functional impact of mutation E334Q . Cofilin - 1 binds to 199 actin filaments by making simultaneous contact with two adjacent monomers . Actin residue E334 is 200 located halfway between two adjacent cofilin molecules , but only makes direct contact with residue 201 L111 of the cofilin – 1 molecule on the pointed end side ( Figure 3A ) . Cofilin – 1 residue L111 is located in 202 an a - helix ( L111 - L128 ) that is essential for actin – binding ( Pope et al , 2000 ) . Mutation E334Q maintains 203 the van der Waals interaction with L111 , but reduces the electrostatic attraction between the 204 interacting surfaces , with likely effects on the stability and allosteric coupling of the complex ( Figure 205 3B , C ) . 206 7 To evaluate the impact of mutation E334Q on the elastic properties of F – actin in the presence and 207 absence of cofilin – 1 binding , we performed normal mode analysis using bare , partially decorated and 208 fully decorated filaments ( Suppl . Figure 2A ) . Since residue E334 is located on the outer surface of the 209 actin filament , the mutation produces no significant change in the normal mode frequencies of bare 210 filaments . Similarly , fully decorated filaments show only minor differences . Substantial changes in the 211 low - frequency modes associated with global conformational changes were observed when comparing 212 the partially cofilin - decorated filaments of WT and mutant filaments , where the bare and cofilin – 213 decorated regions move as rigid bodies and the interface between the two regions acts as a hinge 214 ( modes 7 , 8 ) or fulcrum ( mode 9 ) ( Suppl . Figure 2B ) . 215 To test the validity of our modeling results , we performed biochemical and functional assays probing 216 the interactions of human cofilin – 1 with monomeric and filamentous cytoskeletal g – actin and p . E334Q . 217 The effect of cofilin – 1 on filament assembly was assessed by TIRF microscopy experiments . The 218 polymerization of 1 µM actin was induced in the presence of 0 , 50 or 100 nM cofilin – 1 . Following an 219 initial lag phase of 200 to 300 seconds , the filament formation rate increased with the cofilin – 1 220 concentration ( Figure 4 ) . In experiments with p . E334Q - actin , de novo filament nucleation proceeded 221 faster ( Figure 4A , B ) . Movies showing filament formation by de novo nucleation in the presence of 222 cofilin - 1 are available in the supplement ( Suppl . Video 1 – 6 ) . 223 Next , we investigated the effect of cofilin – 1 on the disassembly of preformed cytoskeletal g – actin and 224 p . E334Q filaments . The effect of cofilin – 1 on existing WT and mutant filaments was initially tested by 225 performing pyrene – based dilution – induced disassembly experiments with actin filaments polymerized 226 for 16 hours and containing predominately ADP – actin . Cofilin – 1 has previously been shown to increase 227 the bulk – disassembly rate of actin in this experimental setup ( Breitsprecher et al , 2011 ; Greve et al , 228 2022 ) . In the absence of cofilin , the changes in pyrene – fluorescence are best described by single 229 exponential functions with k obs values of 0 . 0022 ± 0 . 0002 s - 1 and 0 . 0029 ± 0 . 0003 s - 1 for WT and p . E334Q 230 filaments , respectively ( Figure 5A , Suppl . Figure 3 ) . The addition of cofilin – 1 increased the observed 231 rate of the dilution – induced disassembly in a concentration – dependent manner for both mutant and 232 WT filaments . At the highest cofilin – 1 concentration used ( 40 nM ) , the change in pyrene – fluorescence 233 with p . E334Q filaments is still best described by a single exponential function with a k obs value of 0 . 0059 234 ± 0 . 0008 s - 1 . In contrast , the change for WT filaments is best - fitted to a bi - exponential function . Here , 235 the k obs values for the fast and slow phases are 0 . 0163 ± 0 . 0028 s - 1 and 0 . 0002 ± 0 . 00003 s - 1 , respectively 236 ( Figure 5A , Suppl . Figure 3 ) . Additional experiments with heterofilaments showed milder but 237 significant differences ( Table 1 ) . 238 The pyrene - based bulk experiments show an evident change in the p . E334Q - cofilin interaction . 239 However , they cannot distinguish between changes affecting filament binding and filament 240 disassembly . To analyze the perturbed interaction of p . E334Q with cofilin – 1 in more detail , we first 241 performed high - speed co – sedimentation assays with constant concentrations of F - actin ( 5 µM ) and 242 increasing concentrations of cofilin - 1 ( 0 . 0625 – 20 µM ) at pH 6 . 5 and pH 7 . 8 . Cofilin - 1 binds faster but 243 severs filaments less efficiently under slightly acidic pH conditions , whereas a weakly basic 244 environment favors cofilin – mediated severing ( Wioland et al , 2019 ) . We first performed experiments 245 at pH 6 . 5 . This endpoint experiment showed that cofilin – 1 binds to and disassembles p . E334Q and WT 246 filaments ( Figure 5B , C ) . Most pellet fractions from the experiments conducted with WT filaments were 247 found to contain less cofilin - 1 , as higher disassembly efficiency results in more cofilin – 1 being bound 248 to actin monomers and retained in the supernatant fraction . We repeated the experiment at pH 7 . 8 249 with an equimolar and a 2 – fold excess of cofilin , ( Figure 5B , C ) . In experiments with equimolar cofilin – 250 8 1 , we found significantly less WT actin in the pellet fraction than at pH 6 . 5 , consistent with a higher 251 disassembly – efficiency at pH 7 . 8 . The shift to pH 7 . 8 did not have the same enhancing effect on the 252 disassembly of p . E334Q filaments , as indicated by an increase of p . E334Q actin in the pellet fraction . 253 The endpoint measurements show that cofilin – 1 binds to p . E334Q filaments but severs them less 254 efficiently . Next , we performed fluorescence quench experiments with pyrene - labeled WT and 255 p . E334Q filaments , as it was previously shown that cofilin - 1 efficiently quenches the fluorescence of 256 pyrene - labeled actin filaments ( Blanchoin & Pollard , 1999 ; De La Cruz , 2005 ) . We determined the 257 change in fluorescence amplitude when 2 µM pyrene - labeled p . E334Q or WT filaments were mixed 258 with increasing concentrations of cofilin - 1 . Fitting a quadratic equation to the obtained experimental 259 values gave only slightly different dissociation equilibrium constants of K D , p . E334Q = 1 . 83 ± 0 . 13 µM and 260 K D , WT = 1 . 61 ± 0 . 07 µM ( Figure 5D ) . These K D values are in the range of values previously determined 261 for muscle α - actin filaments ( Blanchoin & Pollard , 1999 ; De La Cruz , 2005 ) , actin filaments from 262 Acanthamoeba castellanii ( Blanchoin & Pollard , 1999 ) and filaments containing a mixture of human g – 263 and β – actin ( De La Cruz , 2005 ) using the same method . 264 To better understand the underlying changes leading to the differences in cofilin – mediated filament 265 disassembly efficiency , we performed two – color TIRF microscopy experiments using Atto – 655 labeled 266 WT or mutant filaments and eGFP – cofilin – 1 . This setup allows us to observe the binding of eGFP – 267 cofilin – 1 to individual filaments and the resulting disassembly of the filaments in real – time . eGFP – 268 cofilin – 1 was shown to bind to actin filaments and disassemble actin as efficiently as WT cofilin – 1 269 ( Wioland et al , 2019 , 2017 ; Breitsprecher et al , 2011 ) . Immediately after mixing 300 nM “aged” actin 270 filaments , capped at their barbed end by human capping protein ( CP ) , with 100 nM eGFP – cofilin – 1 , 271 the reaction mixture was flushed into a flow – chamber and imaging was started . The delay between 272 mixing and the start of imaging was approximately 15 seconds for each sample . At the end of the 273 experimental dead time , almost twice as many cofilin clusters had formed in the field of view on WT 274 filaments ( 151 ± 29 ) as on p . E334Q filaments ( 82 ± 6 ) ( Figure 6A ) , the number of both WT and mutant 275 actin filaments had doubled from initially about 95 to about 200 filaments ( Figure 6B ) , and the Atto – 276 655 fluorescence of the WT filaments had decreased to 30 % of the starting value , whereas the Atto – 277 655 fluorescence of p . E334Q filaments remained unchanged ( Figure 6C ) . During the following 500 s , 278 total eGFP - cofilin - 1 fluorescence increased linearly , with the rate of increase being approximately 279 twice as fast for WT as for p . E334Q filaments ( Figure 6D ) . While the total eGFP - cofilin - 1 fluorescence 280 in the presence of p . E334Q filaments continued to increase linearly over the next 1000 seconds , the 281 signal for WT filaments began to saturate and reached a plateau value ( Figure 6D ) . The number of 282 cofilin clusters on WT filaments decreased steadily during the observation period of 1500 s . In contrast , 283 their number increased in the presence of p . E334Q filaments , reaching a maximum after 500 s , 284 followed by a plateau of 400 s and a subsequent slow decrease ( Figure 6A ) . The changes in the number 285 of actin filaments showed similar time dependencies , a steady decrease for WT filaments and an initial 286 increase for p . E334Q filaments followed immediately by a linear decrease without an intervening 287 plateau phase ( Figure 6B ) . For WT and p . E334Q filaments , the size of eGFP – cofilin – 1 clusters on the 288 steadily shrinking filaments expanded continuously until either severing occurred or the actin filament 289 was fully decorated . No severing events were observed with fully decorated filaments . 290 291 Impact of E334Q mutation on interactions with myosin family proteins 292 The precise nature of the six actin - binding elements in the myosin motor domain varies considerably 293 among myosin isoforms ( Sellers , 2000 ; Cope et al , 1996 ) . The associated sequences have conserved 294 9 hydrophobic and electrostatic properties , variations of which contribute to the tuning of kinetic and 295 functional properties . Actin residue E334 interacts with a positively charged patch in the 296 cardiomyopathy loop ( CM – loop ) of the myosin upper 50 kDa domain of NM2C and Myo5A ( Pospich et 297 al , 2021 ; Von Der Ecken et al , 2016 ) . In the case of NM2C , the electrostatic interaction of E334 with 298 K429 in the CM – loop is further stabilized by van der Waals interactions with I420 and V427 ( Figure 7 ) . 299 A lysine residue corresponding to K429 in NM2C is present in all human myosin – 2 and myosin – 5 300 isoforms . During force - generating interactions with mutant actin filaments , the weakening of 301 complementary electrostatic interactions in this region of the actomyosin interface is likely to 302 attenuate the binding affinity of class 2 and 5 myosins as well as the coupling between their actin and 303 nucleotide binding sites . 304 Cytoskeletal g – actin filaments move with an average sliding velocity of 195 . 3 ± 5 . 0 nm s – 1 on lawns of 305 surface immobilized NM2A – HMM molecules ( Figure 8A , B ) . Filaments formed by p . E334Q actin move 306 5 - fold slower , resulting in an observed average sliding velocity of 39 . 1 ± 3 . 2 nm / s . Filaments 307 copolymerized from a 1 : 1 mixture of WT and p . E334Q actin move with an average sliding velocity of 308 131 . 2 ± 10 nm s – 1 ( Figure 8A , B ) . 309 While we observed similar densities of surface - attached WT and mutant filaments , we noticed 310 increased rapid dissociation and association events for p . E334Q filaments ( Suppl . Video 7 - 9 ) . This 311 prompted us to investigate the impact of the mutation on actomyosin – affinity using transient – kinetic 312 approaches . We determined the dissociation rate constants using a single – headed NM2A – 2R construct 313 ( Figure 8C ) . NM2A – 2R is a constitutively active motor – domain construct generated by fusing the 314 motor – domain of NM2A to two spectrin – like repeats serving as a rigid lever arm extension ( Anson et 315 al , 1996 ) . The construct is ideally suited for the kinetic characterization of the NM2 – isoforms ( Heissler 316 & Manstein , 2011 ) . The dissociation rate constant k - A is 5 . 6 – fold increased from 0 . 08 × 10 - 3 s – 1 to 0 . 45 317 × 10 - 3 s – 1 for NM2A – 2R when p . E334Q filaments are used . A similar change from 0 . 31 × 10 - 3 s – 1 to 1 . 70 318 × 10 - 3 s – 1 was observed for the analogous NM2C – 2R construct ( Figure 8D ) . Next , we determined the 319 affinities of NM2A – 2R for WT and p . E334Q filaments in the absence of nucleotide ( K A ) and the presence 320 of saturating concentrations of ADP ( K DA ) . We performed affinity – titration experiments with pyrene – 321 labeled , phalloidin – stabilized filaments and NM2A – 2R ( Kurzawa & Geeves , 1996 ) . The values 322 measured under rigor conditions show a 9 . 9 - fold reduced affinity of NM2A – 2R for p . E334Q filaments 323 ( K A = 16 . 9 ± 1 . 3 nM ) compared to WT filaments ( K A = 1 . 7 ± 0 . 3 nM ) ( Figure 8E ) . When the experiment 324 was performed in the presence of saturating concentrations of ADP , we obtained values for K DA of 353 . 0 325 ± 20 . 6 nM in the presence of p . E334Q filaments and 122 . 6 ± 11 . 4 nM with WT filaments ( Figure 8F ) . 326 The apparent ATP – affinity ( 1 / K 1 ) of NM2A in complex with WT and p . E334Q filaments showed no 327 significant differences ( Table 1 ) . 328 Next , we investigated the effects of the E334Q mutation on the motile activity of the processive motor 329 Myo5A . Since the lysine residue corresponding to K429 in the CM loop of NM2C is also present in all 330 human myosin 5 isoforms , the resulting changes in binding strength and thermodynamic coupling are 331 expected to reduce the motor activity of Myo5A upon interactions with p . E334Q filaments . Structural 332 studies have shown that the interaction between actin residue E334 and the CM - loop in the Myo5A 333 motor domain is maintained from the rigor to the ADP – bound state ( Pospich et al , 2021 ) . We 334 performed unloaded in vitro motility assays to evaluate the effect of the mutation on the interaction 335 with Myo5A – HMM . The rapid transition from weak to strong binding with a slow and rate - limiting ADP 336 release leading to a high working ratio ( De La Cruz et al , 1999 ) allows the in vitro motility assay to be 337 performed on surfaces with a low motor density . In initial experiments , we found a Myo5A – HMM 338 10 surface density of 770 molecules µm – 2 to be optimal for experiments with WT filaments . Movement 339 was steady and filament breaks were practically non – existent at 770 molecules µm – 2 , while higher 340 surface densities led to increased filament breaks , resulting in rapid fragmentation . At all Myo5A – 341 HMM surface densities used , the sliding velocity was significantly reduced for p . E334Q compared to 342 WT filaments . In experiments with p . E334Q filaments , a 4 - fold higher Myo5A – HMM surface density 343 was required to achieve a similar actin surface decoration and optimal motile activity . Furthermore , 344 filament breaks occurred less frequently , indicating a less efficient actomyosin interaction . The number 345 of moving filaments and their sliding velocity decreased sharply below surface densities of 770 346 molecules / µm 2 for WT filaments and 3100 molecules µm – 2 for p . E334Q filaments . Below a surface 347 density of 380 Myo5A – HMM molecules µm – 2 , no productive attachment events were observed with 348 p . E334Q filaments . Thus , mutation E334Q in cytoskeletal g - actin leads to an impairment of the 349 interaction of the actin filament with Myo5A , similar to the changes observed with NM2A and NM2C , 350 but with additional manifestations specific to processive motors . 351 352 Discussion 353 At present , the exact pathogenesis of non - muscular actinopathies remains poorly understood . A 354 rigorous molecular characterization of the contribution of disturbances in actin dynamics , contractility 355 and transport processes is necessary to develop an understanding of the diverse disease patterns . 356 In the past , the functional characterization of disease – associated mutations in cytoskeletal g - actin 357 focused on mutations p . T89I , p . K118N / M , p . E241K , p . T278I , p . P264L , p . P332A , and p . V370A , which all 358 cause non – syndromic hearing loss . Two mutants showed abnormal polymerization behavior , indicated 359 by a reduced polymerization rate ( p . V370A ) ( Bryan et al , 2006 ) or an increased propensity for bundle 360 formation ( p . E241K ) ( Morín et al , 2009 ) . The mutants p . K118N / M showed a perturbed interaction with 361 the Arp2 / 3 complex , reducing branching efficiency ( Kruth & Rubenstein , 2012 ; Jepsen et al , 2016 ) . A 362 significantly reduced protein stability was observed for two mutant proteins ( p . P264L , p . P332A ) ( Bryan 363 et al , 2006 ) . Perturbed interactions with cofilin were observed for a range of mutations . p . T89I , 364 p . E241K , p . T278I , and p . V370A are characterized by an increased sensitivity to cofilin – mediated 365 filament severing ( Bryan & Rubenstein , 2009 ) . Interestingly , mutation p . P332A , close to the analyzed 366 mutation p . E334Q , enhances resistance towards cofilin - mediated severing ( Bryan & Rubenstein , 367 2009 ) . The perturbed cofilin interaction is the only overlap between the spectrum of molecular 368 phenotypes observed for syndromic deafness - associated mutations and mutation p . E334Q , which 369 results in a non - syndromic actinopathy . It has to be noted that all cited studies relied on the use of 370 actin purified from budding yeast for their biochemical studies , which shows 91 % sequence identity to 371 human cytoskeletal g - actin ( Ng & Abelson , 1980 ) . 372 Here , we describe mutation E334Q in cytoskeletal g – actin that leads to a syndromic actinopathy with 373 hypotonia and is not associated with non – syndromic hearing loss . Our biochemical analysis shows that 374 the mutation does not affect the folding of the actin monomer or the stability of the monomer and the 375 resulting filaments , demonstrating that mutations in the hinge region do not necessarily affect protein 376 stability . The mutant protein displays a robust interaction with the VCA - activated Arp2 / 3 complex . Its 377 polymerization kinetics are equivalent to those of the WT protein , with which it effectively 378 copolymerizes in vitro . Based on these observations , we exclude functional haploinsufficiency as a 379 potential disease mechanism and favor a mechanism in which p . E334Q integrates into the cytoskeletal 380 actin networks of the cell but shows defects in the interaction with key binding partners . Consistent 381 11 with this hypothesis and based on several structural studies ( Pospich et al , 2021 ; Behrmann et al , 2012 ; 382 Robert - Paganin et al , 2021 ; Risi et al , 2021 ; Fujii & Namba , 2017 ; Gyimesi et al , 2020 ; Gong et al , 2022 ; 383 Gurel et al , 2017 ; Von Der Ecken et al , 2016 ) as well as our initial modeling of complexes formed by 384 p . E334Q – filaments , we observed perturbed interactions with cofilin – 1 and human cytoskeletal myosin 385 isoforms NM2A , NM2C and Myo5A ( Table 1 ) . 386 We interpret the observed changes in the interaction with NM2A , NM2C and Myo5A to primarily 387 reflect the weakening of complementary interactions between actin residue E334 and a core contact 388 triad in the myosin CM – loop , which in the case of NM2C consists of K429 and hydrophobic residues 389 I420 and V427 ( Figure 7 ) . Analogous changes in the interaction of mutant filaments with Myo1D , 390 Myo1G , NM2B , Myo5B , Myo5C and Myo19 are expected due to the presence of the core contact triad 391 residues in their CM – loops ( Figure 7B ) . In contrast , the absence of a basic residue corresponding to 392 K429 in NM2C and additional changes affecting their CM loop structure make it difficult to predict the 393 consequences for the interaction of p . E334Q – filaments with the cytoskeletal myosin isoforms Myo1A , 394 Myo1C , Myo1E , Myo1F , Myo3A , Myo3B , Myo15 , Myo18A , Myo18B and Myo19 . 395 In addition to primary consequences , reflected in the observed changes in the binding interactions 396 with NM2A and cofilin – 1 , our results point to significant changes that result from allosteric 397 perturbations . The results from our transient – kinetic analysis of the complexes formed by p . E334Q 398 with NM2A – 2R indicate that reduced allosteric coupling between the actin and nucleotide binding sites 399 within the myosin motor domain contributes to the observed decrease in motor activity . The coupling 400 efficiency is given by the ratio of the dissociation equilibrium constants for actin binding in the absence 401 ( K A ) and presence of ADP ( K DA ) . The value for K DA / K D obtained for the interaction of NM2A – 2R in the 402 presence of p . E334Q ( 20 . 9 ) is 3 . 5 – fold lower than the value measured in the presence of WT actin 403 ( Table 1 ) . Allosteric perturbations are also major contributors mediating the impact of mutation E334Q 404 to the changes in elastic properties and the rate of actin filament disassembly in the presence of cofilin – 405 1 . Our results are consistent with the E334Q mutation slowing the initial complex formation due to less 406 favorable charge interactions and allosteric perturbations having a major impact on subsequent steps . 407 Patients carrying mutations in ACTB or ACTG1 predominately suffer from developmental disabilities , 408 which can be directly linked to cortical malformations of varying severity . Therefore , neuronal cells 409 and / or neuronal progenitor cells are assumed to be the most affected cell population in the patients 410 ( Verloes et al , 2015 ; Di Donato et al , 2016 ; Rivière et al , 2012 ) . The actin composition of the neuron is 411 thought to reach ratios between 1 : 1 and 1 : 2 for g - actin to β - actin in the mature state after fluctuations 412 during neuronal development ( Cheever & Ervasti , 2013 ) . Studies of the spatial localization of the 413 cytoskeletal actin isoforms in the mature neuron are contradictory . A study showing that β - and 414 g - actin strongly colocalize in hippocampal and cerebral neurons ( Cheever et al , 2012 ) appears to 415 contradict previous studies , which reported spatial enrichment of β - actin in dynamic structures such 416 as the dendritic spine and exclusion from less dynamic structures such as the axon shaft , where g - actin 417 was found to be enriched ( Weinberger et al , 1996 ; Micheva et al , 1998 ; Bassell et al , 1998 ) . Based on 418 our results , we conclude that p . E334Q actin is readily produced and integrated into the cytoskeletal 419 actin networks of neuronal cells , where it perturbs interactions with cytoskeletal myosin isoforms that 420 play essential roles in the function and maintenance of healthy neurons . The functions of myosin - 5 421 isoforms in neuronal cells are all linked to their role as actin barbed - end directed processive cargo 422 transporters ( Hammer & Wagner , 2013 ) . Several of the myosin - 5 driven transport - processes are 423 important contributors to synaptic plasticity , i . e . the ability of the neurons to change synaptic strength 424 based on previous activities ( Hammer & Wagner , 2013 ) . 425 12 The different NM2 isoforms are found in a wide range of cell types in the brain , but they show varying 426 spatial expressions ( Murakami & Elzinga , 1992 ; Golomb et al , 2004 ; Rochlin et al , 1995 ; Kawamoto & 427 Adelstein , 1991 ) . NM2A is predominately enriched in the vasculature of the brain , consistent with the 428 importance of NM2A for angiogenesis ( Ma et al , 2020 ) . NM2B and NM2C are mainly found in growth 429 cones and dendritic spines of neuronal cells ( Murakami & Elzinga , 1992 ; Golomb et al , 2004 ; Rochlin et 430 al , 1995 ) . NM2 isoforms are known to contribute to various neuronal processes , but unlike for Myo5A , 431 their exact role is less well understood . NM2B was shown to determine the maturation and 432 morphology of the dendritic spines in hippocampal neurons and was additionally linked to basal 433 synaptic function and plasticity ( Hodges et al , 2011 ; Ma et al , 2004 ; Rex et al , 2010 ) . NM2C and NM2B 434 contribute to the differentiation of oligodendrocytes ( Domingues et al , 2020 ) . The NM2 isoforms 435 compete with proteins of the ADF / cofilin family for binding to F – actin and this competition is essential 436 for stable actomyosin contractility and an intact cell cortex ( Wiggan et al , 2012 ) . 437 In line with this , ADF / cofilin family members are highly abundant in growth cones and dendritic spines 438 and essential for spine morphology and determination of spine length by modulating actin turnover 439 ( Star et al , 2002 ; Hotulainen et al , 2009 ; Namme et al , 2021 ) . Cofilin - mediated severing and nucleation 440 were previously proposed to synergistically contribute to global actin turnover in cells 441 ( Andrianantoandro & Pollard , 2006 ; Du & Frieden , 1998 ) . Our results show that the mutation affects 442 these different cofilin functions in actin dynamics in opposite ways . Cofilin - mediated filament 443 nucleation is more efficient for p . E334Q monomers , while cofilin - mediated severing of filaments 444 containing p . E334Q is significantly reduced . The interaction of both actin monomers and actin 445 filaments with ADF / cofilin proteins involves several distinct overlapping reactions . In the case of actin 446 filaments , cofilin binding is followed by structural modification of the filament , severing and 447 depolymerizing the filament ( De La Cruz & Sept , 2010 ) . Cofilin binding to monomeric actin is followed 448 by the closure of the nucleotide cleft and the formation of stabilized “long - pitch” actin dimers , which 449 stimulate nucleation ( Andrianantoandro & Pollard , 2006 ) . 450 While the number of disease – associated mutations reported for ACTB and ACTG1 is steadily increasing , 451 the total number of patients affected remains low compared to patients with disease – associated 452 mutations in muscle actin isoforms ( Parker et al , 2020 ) . High sequence and structure conservation 453 across all actin isoforms enable us to extrapolate our findings obtained with cytoskeletal g – actin to 454 diseases associated with mutations of E334 in other actin isoforms . Mutations of residue E334 in α – 455 skeletal actin ( encoded by ACTA1 ) are reported to result in nemaline myopathy ( E334K , ( Laing et al , 456 2009 ) ) or core myopathy ( E334A , ( Kaindl et al , 2004 ) ) ( reviewed in ( Parker et al , 2020 ) ) . The mutations 457 either lead to the inversion of the charge at residue 334 ( E334K ) or the complete loss of charge ( E334A ) . 458 Our study shows that loss of charge at actin residue 334 leads to the loss of a conserved core contact 459 between actin and the myosin motor domain of cytoskeletal class 2 myosin . Skeletal muscle myosin – 2 460 is a central component of the sarcomere . The myosin forms the thick filaments that interact with the 461 thin filaments formed by actin and regulatory proteins , generating force that powers muscle 462 contraction ( Sweeney & Hammers , 2018 ) . Because the core contact triad that interacts with actin 463 residue E334 is present in all class 2 myosin isoforms , it is reasonable to assume that mutations of 464 residue E334 in α - skeletal actin affect the interaction with skeletal muscle myosin 2 to a similar extent , 465 resulting in less efficient force generation and thereby contributing to the development of myopathy 466 in patients . 467 Interestingly , a recent study analyzing the prevalence of cytoskeletal actin mutations in cancer using 468 the cBioPortal database found that mutations in ACTB and ACTG1 are associated with lymphoid 469 13 cancers , specifically mutations in ACTB with diffuse large B – cell lymphoma and mutations in ACTG1 470 with multiple myeloma . When the authors extended the analysis to all cancer types , they found that 471 the observed mutations in the two genes were scattered across the entire actin sequence , with no 472 apparent preference for a particular region . Nevertheless , the group identified residue E334 in ACTB 473 as a potential hotspot , as the missense variants p . E334Q / p . E334K are more frequent in all analyzed 474 datasets ( Witjes et al , 2020 ) . In this paper , we investigated the impact of the E334Q exchange on the 475 function of cytoskeletal g – actin in the context of developmental diseases . However , the high sequence 476 similarity between the cytoskeletal actin isoforms makes it highly likely that the E334Q mutation in 477 cytoskeletal β – actin results in similar molecular perturbations of actin dynamics but with potentially 478 different consequences for the organism due to varying enrichment of the two isoforms in functional 479 compartments of the actin cytoskeleton . Although future studies are needed to determine the role of 480 ACTB and ACTG1 mutations as driver or passenger mutations in different cancers , our data show a 481 possible link between impaired cytoskeletal actomyosin dynamics , cofilin – mediated actin turnover and 482 cancer development . 483 484 Material and Methods 485 Plasmids 486 The coding sequence of human cytoskeletal g – actin ( Uniprot - ID : P63261 ) was fused via a C – terminal 487 linker to a His 6 – tagged thymosin β4 moiety ( Uniprot - ID : P62328 ) , as previously described for yeast 488 actin ( Uniprot - ID : P60010 ) ( Noguchi et al , 2007 ) . The fusion protein was cloned into the multiple 489 cloning site of the pFastBac – Dual vector under the control of the polyhedrin promotor . The plasmid 490 encoding the mutant protein p . E334Q was generated by performing site - directed mutagenesis on the 491 WT plasmid . Motor domain carrying fragments of human NM2A , NM2C , and Myo5A were produced 492 using MYH9 , MYH14 , and MYO5A heavy chain sequences , respectively ( Uniprot - IDs : P35579 , Q7Z406 , 493 Q9Y4I1 ) . For the production of HMM - like constructs of human NM2A and human Myo5A , expression 494 vectors derived from pFastBac were used , as described previously ( Hundt et al , 2016 ; Reindl et al , 495 2022 ) . NM2A – HMM was co – produced with human light chains MYL6a ( Uniprot - ID : P60660 ) and 496 MYL12b ( Uniprot - ID : O14950 ) . Myo5A HMM was co – produced with human calmodulin ( Uniprot - ID : 497 P0DP23 ) . NM2A – 2R and NM2C – 2R , single – headed , constitutively active motor domain constructs of 498 human NM2A and NM2C – 2C0 with an artificial lever arm region , were produced using pFastBac – 499 derived expression vectors , as described previously ( Heissler & Manstein , 2011 ; Müller et al , 2013 ) . 500 Human cofilin – 1 ( Uniprot - ID : P23528 ) was cloned into the expression vector pGEX – 6P – 2 ( Greve et al , 501 2022 ) . The human Arp2 / 3 complex consisting of subunits Arp2 ( Uniprot - ID : P61160 ) , Arp3 ( Uniprot - ID : 502 P61158 ) , ArpC1B ( Uniprot - ID : O15143 , ArpC2 ( Uniprot - ID : O15144 ) , ArpC3A ( Uniprot - ID : O15145 ) , 503 ArpC4 ( Uniprot - ID : P59998 ) , ArpC5 ( Uniprot - ID : O15511 ) and a C – terminal FLAG tag on ArpC3A was 504 produced using the expression vector pBIG2abc , provided by Roberto Dominguez ( University of 505 Pennsylvania , Philadelphia , USA ) . The VCA domain of human N – WASP ( Uniprot - ID : O00401 ) was 506 cloned into pGEX – 6P – 2 . Human capping protein ( subunits α1 / β2 , Uniprot - ID : P52907 / P47756 ) in pET – 507 Duet – 1 and eGFP – tagged human cofilin – 1 ( Uniprot - ID : P23528 ) in pGEX – 6P – 2 vector were provided 508 by Jan Faix ( Medizinische Hochschule Hannover , Hannover , Germany ) . Recombinant bacmids and 509 viruses for the production of proteins in the Sf9 system were produced according to the Bac – to – Bac 510 baculovirus expression system protocol ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA , USA ) . 511 512 14 Protein production and purification 513 We produced recombinant human cytoskeletal g – actin and p . E334Q mutant protein as actin – thymosin 514 β4 – His 6 fusion protein using the baculovirus / S . frugiperda insect cell expression system . The C - terminal 515 native actin residue is a phenylalanine , which provides a cleavage site for chymotrypsin to remove 516 downstream tag sequences completely . The tag sequence employed consists of a 14 - amino acid linker 517 ( ASSGGSGSGGSGGA ) , 43 thymosin - β4 residues , followed by 6 histidine residues . To produce WT and 518 mutant fusion proteins , 2×10 9 cells were harvested 72 hours after infection . Cells were pelleted , 519 washed with PBS , shock frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at – 80 °C . Cell pellets from two liters of 520 Sf – 9 culture were thawed for a typical preparation . For lysis , cells were resuspended in lysis buffer – A 521 ( 10 mM Tris pH 7 . 8 , 5 mM CaCl 2 , 10 mM imidazole , 1 . 25 % Triton X – 100 , 100 mM KCl , 7 mM b – 522 mercaptoethanol , 1 mM ATP , 1 mM PMSF , 100 μg / mL TAME , 80 μg / mL TPCK , 2 μg / mL pepstatin , 5 523 μg / mL leupeptin ) and sonicated . The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 30 , 000 × g ( 30 min , 4°C ) . 524 The cleared lysate was loaded onto 3 mL equilibrated PureCube 100 NiNTA agarose ( Cube Biotech , 525 Manheim am Rhein , Germany ) and incubated for two hours under constant rotation . Afterwards , the 526 material was washed extensively with 10 mM Tris pH 7 . 8 , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 10 mM imidazole , 50 mM KCl , 527 1 mM ATP and the actin – thymosin β4 fusion protein was eluted with 10 mM Tris pH 7 . 8 , 250 mM 528 imidazole , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM ATP . Peak fractions were pooled and dialyzed overnight against G – 529 buffer ( 10 mM Tris pH 7 . 8 , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 1 mM ATP , 0 . 5 mM DTT ) . The next day , protein aggregates 530 were removed by centrifugation at 15 , 000 × g ( 20 min , 4 °C ) . The supernatant was pooled and α – 531 chymotrypsin ( Sigma - Aldrich , Schnelldorf , Germany ) was added at a w / w ratio of 1 : 300 532 ( chymotrypsin : actin ) to remove the tag - sequences . The optimal digestion time varied from 45 to 80 533 min and needs to be determined for each batch of α – chymotrypsin . PMSF was added to a final 534 concentration of 0 . 2 mM to stop the digestion . Actin was separated from the thymosin - His tag using 535 polymerization - depolymerization steps . Unless otherwise stated , all protein purification steps were 536 carried out at 4°C . F - actin was stored on ice . G - actin was concentrated to approximately 150 µM , flash 537 frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at – 80°C in G – buffer . Clarified G - actin , free of aggregates and 538 oligomers , was always prepared fresh . G - actin stocks were thawed , diluted in G - buffer to the 539 appropriate concentration , and centrifuged at 136 , 000 × g ( 15 min , 4°C ) . The top 2 / 3 of the centrifuged 540 sample was carefully removed for use in further experiments . All myosin constructs were produced in 541 the baculovirus / S . frugiperda insect cell expression system and purified as previously described for 542 NM2A – HMM ( Greve et al , 2022 ; Hundt et al , 2016 ; Pathan - Chhatbar et al , 2018 ) , Myo5A – HMM ( Reindl 543 et al , 2022 ) , the single – headed , constitutively active constructs NM2A – 2R ( Heissler & Manstein , 2011 ; 544 Müller et al , 2013 ) and NM2C – 2R ( Heissler & Manstein , 2011 ; Müller et al , 2013 ) . Production of the 545 human Arp2 / 3 complex in insect cells followed the procedure described in Zimmet et al . ( Zimmet et al , 546 2020 ) . Human cofilin – 1 and human eGFP – cofilin – 1 were produced as GST – fusion proteins in Rosetta2 547 ( DE3 ) cells . Purification was carried out as previously described for human cofilin – 1 ( Greve et al , 2022 ) . 548 Human GST – N – WASP – VCA was produced in ArcticExpress ( DE3 ) cells . The cells were lysed by 549 treatment with lysozyme followed by sonification in lysis buffer – W ( 25 mM Tris pH 7 . 4 , 50 mM NaCl , 550 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM DTT , 0 . 5 % Triton X – 100 , 1 mM PMSF ) . The cleared cell lysate was loaded onto a 551 self – packed GSH – Sepharose column . The column was then washed with five column volumes of wash 552 buffer – W ( 25 mM TRIS pH 7 . 4 , 50 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM DTT ) . GST – N – WASP – VCA was eluted 553 from the column by applying 10 mM glutathione in wash buffer – W . The eluted protein was 554 concentrated and loaded onto a S75 16 / 600 size exclusion chromatography column ( GE Healthcare , 555 Chicago , USA ) . After chromatography , fractions containing pure protein were pooled , concentrated 556 15 and the concentration was determined via absorbance at 280 nm . The GST – N – WASP – VCA protein was 557 frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at – 80°C . 558 Human capping protein ( α1 / β2 ) carrying a 6×His – tag was produced in Rosetta2 ( DE3 ) cells . For 559 purification , cells were lysed by lysozyme followed by sonification in lysis buffer - CP ( 25 mM Tris pH 7 . 8 , 560 250 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM PMSF , 1 . 5 % Triton X – 100 , 10 mM imidazole , 7 mM beta – 561 mercaptoethanol ) . The cleared lysate was loaded onto PureCube 100 NiNTA agarose ( Cube Biotech , 562 Monheim am Rhein , Germany ) in a gravity – flow column . The agarose was washed with wash buffer – 563 CP ( 25 mM Tris pH 7 . 8 , 250 mM NaCl , 30 mM imidazole ) and the protein was then eluted with elution 564 buffer – CP ( 25 mM Tris pH 7 . 8 , 50 mM NaCl , 250 mM imidazole ) . Fractions with pure capping protein 565 were pooled , concentrated and loaded onto a S200 16 / 600 size exclusion chromatography column ( GE 566 Healthcare , Chicago , USA ) . The purified protein was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at – 80°C . 567 a – skeletal actin ( Uniprot - ID : P68139 ) was prepared from chicken pectoralis major muscle , as 568 previously described for rabbit a – skeletal actin ( Lehrer & Kerwar , 1972 ) . 569 Unless otherwise stated , all purification steps were performed at 4°C . 570 571 DNase – I inhibition assay , DSF and nucleotide exchange assay 572 The DNase – I inhibition assay and DSF to study actin folding and thermal stability were performed as 573 previously described ( Greve et al , 2022 ) . 574 Nucleotide exchange experiments were performed with freshly clarified G – actin as follows . The G – 575 actin solution was passed through a Zeba™ spin desalting column ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , 576 MA , USA ) equilibrated with G – buffer to remove excess nucleotide . The sample was then incubated 577 with a 2 – fold excess of ε – ATP or ε – ADP ( Jena Bioscience , Jena , Germany ) for two hours on ice . After 578 incubation , excess nucleotide was removed by passing the sample through a Zeba™ spin desalting 579 column equilibrated with 10 mM TRIS pH 8 . 0 and 10 µM ε – ATP / ε – ADP . The concentration of the Ca 2 + – 580 ε – ATP / ε – ADP – G – actin solution was determined using the Coomassie protein assay ( Thermo Fisher 581 Scientific , Waltham , MA , USA ) . Prior to the nucleotide exchange experiment the Ca 2 + – ε – ATP / ε – ADP – 582 G – actin solution was supplemented with 10× Mg 2 + - exchange buffer ( 1 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM EGTA ) to a 583 final concentration of 0 . 1 mM MgCl 2 and 1 mM EGTA . The resulting solution was rapidly mixed 1 : 1 with 584 assay buffer – SF containing excess unlabeled ATP ( 10 mM TRIS pH 7 . 8 , 0 . 2 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM ATP ) 585 using a HiTech Scientific SF61 stopped – flow system ( TgK Scientific Limited , Bradford on Avon , UK ) . The 586 ε – ATP / ε – ADP fluorescence was excited at 335 nm and monitored through a KV389 cut – off filter . The 587 displacement of the fluorescent nucleotide analogs by ATP results in a decrease in the fluorescence 588 amplitude , which is best described by a single exponential fit that yields the apparent rate of nucleotide 589 dissociation 590 591 CD spectroscopy 592 Directly prior to the measurement , the freshly clarified G - actin was diluted to 0 . 05 mg / mL in 10 mM 593 phosphate buffer pH 7 . 4 . A buffer reference was prepared by mixing G buffer with 10 mM phosphate 594 buffer pH 7 . 4 in the same ratio . CD spectroscopy was performed with a PiStar 180 spectrometer 595 ( Applied Photophysics , Leatherhead , UK ) . Measurements were performed at 25°C using quartz 596 cuvettes ( 0 . 3 cm path length ) and nitrogen purging . CD spectra were recorded from 176 nm to 280 nm 597 16 in steps of 1 nm using a bandwidth of 4 nm . For every sample , three spectra were recorded and 598 subsequently averaged . The averaged buffer spectrum was subtracted , and the resulting protein 599 spectrum smoothed using a Savitsky – Golay filter ( Savitzky & Golay , 1964 ) in two consecutive iterations . 600 The DichroWeb online platform was used to determine the secondary structure composition 601 ( Whitmore & Wallace , 2004 ) . Data were analyzed based on the mean residue ellipticity [ 𝜃 ] MRE of the 602 sample using the CDSSTR algorithm and reference set 3 ( optimized for 185 nm – 240 nm ) . 603 604 Steady – state ATPase assay 605 The steady – state ATPase activity of F – actin was measured using a NADH – coupled enzymatic assay 606 ( Furch et al , 1998 ) . Experiments were performed with 10 µM F – actin at 37 °C in assay buffer – A ( 25 mM 607 HEPES pH 7 . 3 , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 50 mM KCl , 0 . 5 mM DTT ) supplemented with the enzymatic system , which 608 generates the quantifiable readout ( 1 mM ATP , 0 . 5 mM NADH , 0 . 5 mM 2 – phosphoenolpyruvate , 0 . 02 609 mg / mL lactate dehydrogenase from rabbit muscle ( Sigma - Aldrich , Schnelldorf , Germany ) , 0 . 05 mg / mL 610 pyruvate kinase from rabbit muscle ( Sigma - Aldrich , Schnelldorf , Germany ) , 0 . 5 mM NADH ) . The change 611 in absorbance at 340 nm due to oxidation of NADH was recorded in a Multiskan FC Microplate 612 Photometer ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA , USA ) . 613 614 TIRF microscopy – based assays 615 To distinguish between the impact of the mutation on filament nucleation and elongation , we 616 performed TIRF microscopy – based assays using freshly clarified protein . Unlabeled WT or mutant G – 617 actin was supplemented with 10 % Atto – 655 labeled WT or mutant G – actin for visualization of the 618 filament assembly process . Glass coverslips were cleaned , surfaces chemically treated and flow cells 619 assembled as described previously ( Greve et al , 2022 ) . To induce polymerization , the G – actin solutions 620 were diluted to a final concentration of 1 µM with 2× TIRF – buffer ( 20 mM imidazole , 50 mM KCl , 1 mM 621 MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 15 mM glucose , 20 mM β – ME , 0 . 25 % methylcellulose , 0 . 1 mg / mL 622 glucose oxidase and 0 . 02 mg / mL catalase . The solutions were mixed , immediately flushed into flow 623 cells and image acquisition was started . 624 To follow filament disassembly , two – color TIRF experiments with Atto – 655 labeled actin and eGFP – 625 cofilin – 1 were performed with preformed filaments that were “aged” and capped at their barbed end 626 by human capping protein . WT or mutant actin was polymerized for 3 hours at room temperature and 627 then moved to 4 °C overnight . “Aged” F – actin and human capping protein were diluted into TIRF – 628 buffer to generate capped actin filaments . eGFP – cofilin – 1 was added to final concentrations of 300 nM 629 F – actin , 25 nM capping protein and 100 nM eGFP – cofilin – 1 . Immediately adding eGFP – cofilin – 1 , the 630 reaction mixture was flushed into the flow cell and image acquisition was started . Images were 631 captured using a Nikon Eclipse TI – E inverted microscope equipped with a 100× / 1 . 49 NA Apo oil 632 immersion objective and Ixon3 897 EMCCD cameras ( Andor , Belfast , UK ) under control of the NIS 633 software ( Nikon , Minato , Japan ) . Images were taken every 3 seconds with an exposure time of 60 ms . 634 To analyze actin polymerization in the presence of ABPs , the ABPs were first pre – diluted in KMEI buffer 635 and diluted to their final concentration in TIRF buffer just before adding actin . Image acquisition was 636 performed as described for experiments with actin only . Image analysis for all TIRF microscopy 637 experiments was performed using ImageJ ( Rueden et al , 2017 ) . The elongation rate of actin filaments 638 was determined by manually tracking individual filaments . Only filaments that could be tracked for at 639 17 least four consecutive minutes were used to determine the elongation rate . Using these criteria , 20 to 640 30 filaments were tracked in each individual experiment ( in a microscopic field of view of 81 . 41 × 641 81 . 41 µm ) . For quantification of two – color TIRFM – experiments , 52 × 52 µm ROIs from the entire 642 microscopic field of view were used . The number of filaments observed throughout an experiment was 643 determined using the Analyze Particle tool in ImageJ after background – subtraction ( sliding paraboloid , 644 rolling ball radius : 25 pixels ) . 645 646 Unloaded in vitro motility assay 647 The unloaded in vitro motility assay to study the interaction between WT and mutant actin and NM2A – 648 HMM or Myo5A – HMM was essentially performed as previously described ( Greve et al , 2022 ; Reindl et 649 al , 2022 ; Kron & Spudich , 1986 ) . Flow cells used in the in vitro motility assay were constructed using 650 nitrocellulose – coated coverslips . NM2A – HMM requires phosphorylation of the associated regulatory 651 light chain for full enzymatic activity . Purified NM2A – HMM was incubated with the GST – tagged kinase 652 domain ( residues 1425 - 1776 ) of human smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase ( Uniprot - ID : 653 A0A8I5KU53 ) at a molar ratio of 10 : 1 in 25 mM MOPS , pH 7 . 3 , 50 mM KCl , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM CaCl 2 , 654 0 . 2 µM calmodulin , 3 µM regulatory light chain ( MLC12b ) , 3 µM essential light chain ( MLC6a ) , 1 mM 655 DTT and 1 mM ATP for 30 minutes at 30 °C . In experiments with Myo5A – HMM , each buffer and actin 656 solution was supplemented with 2 μM calmodulin to prevent calmodulin dissociation from Myo5A – 657 HMM . Olympus IX70 or Olympus IX83 inverted fluorescence microscopes ( Olympus , Hamburg , 658 Germany ) equipped with a 60× / 1 . 49 NA PlanApo oil immersion objective and an Orca Flash 4 . 0 CMOS 659 camera ( Hamamatsu Photonics Deutschland GmbH , Herrsching , Germany ) were used for image 660 acquisition . All in vitro motility experiments were performed at a 37°C . Analysis of the recorded image 661 series was performed in ImageJ ( Rueden et al , 2017 ) . The Plugin wrmTrck ( Nussbaum - Krammer et al , 662 2015 ) , developed by Jesper S . Pedersen , was used to determine the trajectories and corresponding 663 velocities of the individual actin filaments . Only filaments that showed movement for at least 30 664 consecutive seconds were tracked and used to determine the average sliding velocity . 665 666 Pyrene – actin based bulk – polymerization assays 667 The polymerization and depolymerization of pyrene – labeled recombinant WT or mutant actin ( 5 % 668 pyrene - labeled WT or mutant actin ) was monitored as a function of increasing or decreasing pyrene – 669 fluorescence using a Synergy 4™ microplate reader ( BioTek Instruments , Winooski , VT , USA ) and the 670 built – in filter set ( Excitation : 340 / 30 nm , Emission : 400 / 30 nm ) at 25 °C . For polymerization 671 experiments , 20 µL of a 10 µM solution of pyrene – labeled Mg 2 + – ATP – G – actin ( WT or mutant ) was 672 placed in a black flat bottom 96 – well plate ( BrandTech Scientific , USA ) . 80 µL of 1 . 25 × polymerization 673 buffer ( 10 mM TRIS , pH 7 . 8 , 100 mM KCl , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 5 mM EGTA , 0 . 1 mM DTT and 0 . 1 mM ATP ) 674 was added to the wells using the built – in pipetting function of the plate reader and the polymerization 675 of actin was followed as an increase in pyrene – fluorescence . For depolymerization experiments , 3 µL 676 of a 20 µM F – actin solution was placed in one well of the plate . The solution was rapidly diluted by the 677 addition of 297 µL G – buffer . The depolymerization of the filaments was monitored as a decrease in 678 pyrene – fluorescence . 679 The effects of Arp2 / 3 ( + GST – N – WASP – VCA ) and cofilin – 1 on filament assembly or disassembly were 680 analyzed by dispensing the actin solution and the ABP solution into the well by hand without mixing . 681 18 Polymerization buffer or G – buffer was added , the reaction components were thereby mixed and 682 recording of the ensuing changes in fluorescence intensity was started . 683 The bulk – polymerization rate was determined according to Doolittle et al . ( Doolittle et al , 2013 ) . A 684 linear regression was fitted to the linear region around the time – point of half – maximal fluorescence . 685 The depolymerization experiments were evaluated by fitting a single exponential function to the data , 686 including a linear component that accounts for bleaching . 687 688 Co – sedimentation experiments 689 Actin was polymerized at 20 μM for 3 hours at room temperature before being moved to 4 °C 690 overnight . For co – sedimentation experiments at pH 7 . 8 , 5 μM of “aged” F – actin and varying 691 concentrations of human cofilin – 1 were mixed in assay buffer – C ( 10 mM TRIS , pH 7 . 8 , 100 mM KCl , 5 692 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 5 mM EGTA , 0 . 1 mM DTT and 0 . 1 mM ATP ) to a final volume of 50 μL in 1 . 5 mL 693 polypropylene centrifuge tubes ( Beckman Coulter , Brea , CA , USA ) suited for high – speed centrifugation . 694 For experiments performed at pH 6 . 5 , assay buffer – C was supplemented with piperazine – N , Nʹ – bis ( 2 – 695 ethanesulfonic acid ) ( PIPES , pH 6 . 5 ) to a final concentration of 100 mM to induce a pH shift from 7 . 8 696 to 6 . 5 . Actin and cofilin – 1 were added after the pH shift . Samples were incubated for 10 minutes at 697 23°C and then centrifuged at 136 , 000 × g ( 15 min , 4°C ) . The pellet and supernatant fractions were 698 subjected to SDS – PAGE and the gel was imaged at a ChemiDoc – MP – gel documentation system ( Bio – 699 Rad Laboratories , Hercule , CA , USA ) . The amount of actin and cofilin – 1 in the pellet and supernatant 700 was determined via densitometry using the Image Lab software ( Bio – Rad Laboratories , Hercule , CA , 701 USA ) . 702 703 Transient kinetic analysis of the actomyosin complex 704 Myosin binding to pyrene – labeled actin leads to strong pyrene – fluorescence quenching . Mixing of the 705 rigor – pyrene – acto – NM2A – 2R / NM2C – 2R complex with an excess of unlabeled actin allows the 706 determination of k - A ( dissociation rate of myosin from F – actin in the absence of nucleotide ) . Prior to 707 the experiment , pyrene – labeled phalloidin – stabilized WT or mutant F – actin and the myosin solutions 708 were treated with apyrase ( Merck KGaA , Darmstadt , Germany ) to remove residual nucleotide . Pyrene – 709 labeled actin was mixed with a 1 . 5 – fold excess of NM2A – 2R / NM2C – 2R in assay buffer – P ( 20 mM MOPS 710 pH 7 . 0 , 100 mM KCl , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM DTT ) and incubated for 5 minutes on ice . The solution was 711 mixed with an excess of chicken a – skeletal actin in assay buffer – P to final concentrations of 0 . 5 μM 712 pyrene – labeled actin , 0 . 75 μM NM2A – 2R and 5 μM a – skeletal actin . The solution was immediately 713 transferred into the well of a black 96 – well microplate with a transparent bottom and a lid ( Corning , 714 Corning , NY , USA ) . Fluorescence was excited at 365 nm and measured at 407 nm in a CLARIOstar Plus 715 microplate reader ( BMG LABTECH , Offenburg , Germany ) using bottom optics over 9 hours . The 716 dissociation rate ( k - A ) of myosin from actin was determined by applying a single – exponential fit to the 717 data . 718 The apparent affinity of NM2A – 2R to WT or mutant F – actin in the absence ( K A ) or presence ( K DA ) of 719 nucleotide was determined using the method developed by Kurzawa and Geeves ( Kurzawa & Geeves , 720 1996 ) . To determine K A , all protein samples were treated with apyrase before the experiment . 100 nM 721 pyrene – labeled phalloidin – stabilized F – actin was incubated with increasing concentrations of NM2A – 722 2R ( 10 – 1 , 300 nM ) for 5 minutes on ice in assay buffer – P without DTT . The solutions were shot against 723 19 20 µM ATP at a HiTech Scientific SF61 stopped – flow system ( TgK Scientific Limited , Bradford on Avon , 724 UK ) in a 1 : 1 ratio at 20 °C . Fluorescence was excited at 365 nm and recorded using a KV389 cut – off 725 filter . At least five transients were averaged for each concentration of NM2A – 2R and fitted using a 726 single – exponential function . The relative fluorescence amplitudes were plotted against the pre – mix 727 myosin concentrations . The affinity was determined by applying a quadratic equation to the dataset , 728 where A is the amplitude , A max the amplitude under saturation , [ F – actin ] the actin concentration prior 729 mix , [ NM2A – 2R ] the variable NM2A – 2R concentration and K the dissociation constant in the absence 730 or presence of nucleotide . 731 A = A ! " # × ( [ F − Actin ] + [ NM2A − 2R ] + 𝐾 ) − 4 ( [ F − Actin ] + [ NM2A − 2R ] + 𝐾 ) $ − 4 × [ F − Actin ] × [ NM2A − 2R ] 2 × [ F − Actin ] 732 733 Slight modifications of the experimental protocol were necessary to determine K DA . Incubation with 734 apyrase was omitted , instead the pyrene – actomyosin complex was incubated with 30 µM ADP ( Merck 735 KGaA , Darmstadt , Germany ) for 20 minutes on ice prior to measurement . To account for the lower 736 affinity in the presence of ADP , the range of used myosin concentrations was extended up to 3 , 000 737 nM . Additionally , the concentration of ATP in the mixing experiment was increased to 300 µM pre – 738 mix . Data was recorded and evaluated as done for experiments without nucleotide . 739 The apparent ATP – affinity of the actomyosin complex was determined by mixing the apyrase – treated , 740 pyrene – labeled , phalloidin – stabilized actomyosin complex with increasing concentrations of ATP at 741 the stopped – flow system . Fitting an exponential function to the individual transients yields the ATP – 742 dependent dissociation rate of NM2A – 2R from F – actin ( k obs ) . The k obs – values were plotted against the 743 corresponding ATP concentrations and a hyperbola was fitted to the data . The fit yields the apparent 744 ATP affinity ( 1 / K 1 ) of the actomyosin complex and the maximal dissociation rate . 745 746 Molecular modelling 747 Homology models of human cytoskeletal g – actin , human cofilin – 1 and the human NM2A motor 748 domain were generated with MODELLER ( Sali & Blundell , 1993 ) . Models of filamentous human 749 cytoskeletal g – actin with bound cofilin – 1 or NM2A motor domain were generated based on cryo – EM 750 structures obtained from the Protein Data Bank of the barbed end side of a cofilactin cluster ( pdb : 751 6UC4 , 6UBY , 6VAO ) ( Huehn et al , 2020 ) and a human cytoplasmic actomyosin complex ( pdb : 5JLH ) 752 ( Von Der Ecken et al , 2016 ) . The structures were accessed on May 25 , 2023 . Mutation E334Q was 753 introduced using the mutagenesis tool in PyMOL ( Schrödinger , LLC , 2015 ) . PyMOL and ChimeraX 754 ( Goddard et al , 2018 ; Pettersen et al , 2021 ) were used for distance measurements and visualization of 755 Coulomb surfaces . 756 Identification and alignment of the CM – loop region of cytoskeletal myosin isoforms were performed 757 using the match function of ChimeraX , by superimposing and aligning cytoskeletal myosin isoform 758 structures on NM2C ( pdb - NM2C : 5JLH , pdb - Myo5A : 7PM5 , pdb - Myo5C : 5HMP , pdb - Myo1D : AF - 759 O94832 - F1 , pdb - Myo15 : 7UDT , pdb - Myo19 : AF - Q96H55 - F1 ) . Where appropriate , the corresponding 760 human sequences were retrieved from UniProt and structurally aligned . 761 Normal mode analyses ( NMA ) were performed using the Elastic Network Model ( ENM ) elNémo ( Suhre 762 & Sanejouand , 2004 ) and an nrbl value of 5 . 763 764 20 Data Analysis 765 Data analysis and graph plotting were performed with Origin 2023 ( OriginLab Corporation . 766 Massachusetts , USA ) . Errors are given as standard error of the mean ( SEM ) based on three 767 independent experiments if not otherwise specified . The significance of the data was evaluated in 768 Origin 2023 using a two – sample t – test ( p > 0 . 05 ≙ ns , p ≤ 0 . 05 ≙ * , p ≤ 0 . 01 ≙ * * , p ≤ 0 . 001 ≙ * * * , 769 p ≤ 0 . 0001 ≙ * * * * ) . 770 771 Author Contributions 772 All authors discussed the results and contributed to the final manuscript ; J .
