Cells actively and transiently test rigidity using mechanisms limited by inherent physical parameters that include the strength of extracellular attachments , the pulling capacity on these attachments , and the sensitivity of the mechanotransduction system . Here , we focus on rigidity sensing mediated through the integrin family of extracellular matrix receptors and linked proteins and discuss the evidence supporting these proteins as mechanosensors . What Is Rigidity and Why Is It Important ? Local rigidities form a landscape within an organism . During development , this landscape acts in concert with chemical cues to shape the organism ( Keller et al . , 2003 ) . Conversely , recovery from injury can require cells to sense and reshape this landscape , as seen in healing of bones and wounds ( Chao et al . , 1989 ; Grinnell , 1994 ; Hinz , 2006 ) . Numerous pathologies are characterized by disturbance of the rigidity landscape , including atherosclerosis , arthritis , osteoporosis , and ﬁbrosis of the heart , lung , kidney , and liver ( Ingber , 2003 ) . There are also a growing number of medical uses for pharmacological drugs that affect the rigidity of tissues , including Botulinum toxin ( relaxes smooth muscles ) and Rho kinase inhibitors ( relaxes cytoskeleton ) ( Felber , 2006 ; Hahmann and Schroeter , 2010 ) . Recently , an appreciation for the altered rigidity responses of cancer cells has emerged ( Kostic et al . , 2009 ; Wang et al . , 2000b ) . However , rigidity sensing defects are likely to have an important role in classical ‘‘anchorage independence’’ studies ( Stoker et al . , 1968 ) that examined the ability of cancerous , but not normal , cells to proliferate on each other when in suspension . In a broad sense , rigidity is a measure of the relationship between applied forces and the resulting stretch of a material . To quantify it , the elastic ( or Young’s ) modulus and the shear modulus are commonly employed . Both are deﬁned as the ratio of the stress ( applied force per unit area ) to the resulting strain . For the elastic modulus ( E ) , the force is applied perpendicular to the material’s surface , whereas for shear modulus ( G ) , the force is applied parallel to the surface ( Figure 1A ) . Because strain is a dimensionless value , the units for rigidity are force per area , with the SI unit being the Pascal ( Burdun et al . , 1972 ) . However , to ease interpretation of the values , this review will use the proposed ‘‘natural’’ SI units for pressure of nN / m m 2 ( equivalent to kPa , Hochmuth , 2000 ) . There are two useful observations that assist the interpretation of elastic and shear moduli values . The ﬁrst is that they represent the amount of force per unit area required to double the length of a material ( elastic modulus ) or deﬂect it by a distance equal to its height ( shear modulus ) . The second is that elastic and shear moduli are related by the following function : E = 2 G ( 1 + v ) , where v is the Poisson ratio . For materials that do not change volume under stretch , the Pois - son ratio equals 0 . 5 . As a consequence , the elastic modulus will be three times its shear modulus . There are important limitations to shear and elastic moduli values of biological materials . In particular , they assume a linear relationship between stress and strain , which is not the case for either cells or extracellular matrix ( ECM ) components ( Storm et al . , 2005 ) . Rather biological material has a viscoelastic behavior where the relationship between stress and strain depends not only on the magnitude of the force applied , but also on the rate of application ( Fabry et al . , 2001 ; Puxkandl et al . , 2002 ) . This implies that stiffness values reported in the literature will depend on the range of forces applied and on the time scale of force application . This review will examine the reported physical and motility parameters of tissues , cells , and proteins and project those constraints onto how cells sense rigidities through integrins . The Rigidity Landscape The rigidity landscape of a tissue arises from its constituent cells and ECM . The elastic moduli of tissues range from 0 . 1 to 30 , 000 , 000 nN / m m 2 ( Table 1 ) . The typical hierarchy of tissue rigidity is that brain ( 0 . 1 – 10 nN / m m 2 ) is softer than muscle ( 10 – 100 nN / m m 2 ) , which is softer than areolar connective tissue and arteries ( 100 – 1 , 000 nN / m m 2 ) , which are softer than bone ( 15 , 000 , 000 – 30 , 000 , 000 nN / m m 2 ) . The rigidity of a tissue is neither static nor uniform . For instance , the stiffness of brain decreases with age ( Gefen et al . , 2003 ) . Local rigidity differences have also been observed in the kidney cortex and hippocampus ( Elkin et al . , 2007 ; Kallel et al . , 1998 ) . Further , there are local rigidity differences within individual cells ( Roca - Cusachs et al . , 2008 ; Yamada et al . , 2000 ) . The Rigidity Preferences of Cells The rigidity preferences of cells generally reﬂect their native environments . Neutrophils exist in a broad range of rigidities 194 Developmental Cell 19 , August 17 , 2010 ª 2010 Elsevier Inc . from the blood to a variety of tissues during inﬂammation ; these cells attachand havesimilarshapesonglass ason0 . 002nN / m m 2 gels ( Yeung et al . , 2005 ) . From asoft tissue like the brain , neurons are more branched on substrates of 0 . 05 nN / m m 2 compared to 0 . 55 nN / m m 2 and they extend faster on substrates of 0 . 002 nN / m m 2 compared to 0 . 130 nN / m m 2 ( Balgude et al . , 2001 ; Flanagan et al . , 2002 ) . Fibroblasts and endothelial cells , origi - nating from tissues of ‘‘midrange’’ stiffnesses , do not spread or display actin stress ﬁbers on surfaces softer than 3 nN / m m 2 ( Pelham and Wang , 1997 ; Yeung et al . , 2005 ) . From the stiff envi - ronment of cartilage and bone , chondrocytes do not spread well on substrates softer than 7 . 4 nN / m m 2 ( Subramanian and Lin , 2005 ) , and the degree of adhesion protein clustering in preosteo - blasts is maximized at 60 nN / m m 2 ( Kong et al . , 2005 ) . Cells can also be guided by differences in rigidity , a phenomenon known asdurotaxis . Bothﬁbroblastsandleukocyteshavebeenreported to move toward rigid substrates ( Lo et al . , 2000 ; Mandeville et al . , 1997 ) . Another related cellular process is endothelial cell remod - eling to shear stress . Although this process differs from rigidity sensing in that it does not appear to require cells to actively pull on their environment , both processes involve sensing mechan - ical force in a time - and magnitude - sensitive manner and may therefore share similar mechanosensory mechanisms ( Ando and Yamamoto , 2009 ) . Bond Strengths Throughout the rigidity sensing process , the key molecular mechanism by which force is detected is through its effect on the binding and conformation of proteins . Two interacting pro - teins can be described as having a ‘‘bound’’ and an ‘‘unbound’’ state , with an energy barrier necessary to switch between the two . Analogously , the switch between two conformations in a single protein ( e . g . , folded / unfolded or open / closed channel ) can be characterized in the same way . A higher barrier will make it more difﬁcult to change conﬁgurations . As ﬁrst envi - sioned by Bell ( 1978 ) , the force required to break a bond can be understood as an input of energy into the system . Force reduces the activation barrier between the two , thereby promoting the transition to the unbound state ( Figure 1B ) . This type of behavior , common to most protein interactions , is called a slip bond . Catch bonds are exceptions to this rule . In response to applied force , the energy landscape of catch bonds changes in such a way as to increase their strength ( energy barrier ) under certain force regimes ( Prezhdo and Pereverzev , 2009 ; Thomas et al . , 2008 ) . The possibility that these bonds have an important role in rigidity sensing will be discussed below . Quantifying the energy barrier between bound and unbound states is the optimal way to characterize a protein bond . However , this value is difﬁcult to obtain in live cells , which are strongly out of thermodynamic equilibrium ( having large local and temporal variations in energy levels ) ( Collin et al . , 2005 ) . For this reason , studies usually report the force needed to break a bond in a particular assay . For these assays , the rate at which force is loaded will affect the force measurement ( Evans , 2001 ) . This important caveat must be taken into account when comparing force values , and that is why in this review , we specify the loading rate whenever reported . Determinants of What Cells Can Sense through Integrins Going from the ECM to the inside of the cell , the matrix - integrin bonds are the primary links . Integrins are transmembrane het - erodimers composed of an a and a b chain . In vertebrates , there are 18 a and 8 b subunits that assemble into 24 different heterodimers ( Takada et al . , 2007 ) . Integrins mediate attach - ment to a variety of ECM components , including ﬁbronectin , collagen , laminin , and vitronectin ( Barczyk et al . , 2010 ) . In general , the a subunit determines the substrate speciﬁcity , Figure 1 . Rigidity Moduli and the Energy Landscapes of a Slip Bond ( A ) Stress isthe amount offorceapplied per area ( F / A ) and strain is the displacement in the direction of applied force relative to initial length ( D x / L or D L / L ) . While both elastic and shear moduli are the ratio of stress over strain , there is a difference in the direction of the applied force .

Integrins undergo a mechanical cycle in forming adhesive contacts ( Puklin - Faucher and Sheetz , 2009 ) , and there are important functional differences between integrin complexes . For instance , less stable a v b 3 integrins initiate signal transduction , while higher matrix forces are supported by a 5 b 1 integrins ( Roca - Cusachs et al . , 2009 ) . Four key parameters determine what rigidities cells can sense through integrins : ( 1 ) the strength of integrin binding to extracel - lular ligands , ( 2 ) the force and ( 3 ) the speed of cell retractions , and ( 4 ) the sensitivity of associated mechanosensors . Strength of the Integrin Link to the ECM Matrix attaches to integrins and integrins attach to actin ﬁla - ments through several direct and indirect routes . However , talin , ﬁlamin , a - actinin , and tensin are integrin binding proteins that also bind directly to actin ( Delon and Brown , 2007 ) . Of these proteins , talin appears to be the one involved in the initial adhesion events , as it is located closer to the leading edge than a - actinin ( Izzard , 1988 ; Zaidel - Bar et al . , 2003 ) , while ﬁla - mins appear to be involved in later adhesion events ( Calderwood et al . , 2001 ) . As the adhesion matures , additional proteins are recruited to reinforce the linkage , including vinculin , which binds actin and talin ( Burridge and Mangeat , 1984 ) . In the absence of talin , vinculin staining is diffuse and traction forces are disrupted ( Jiang et al . , 2003 ; Zhang et al . , 2008 ) . Thus , there are ﬁve noncovalent interactions in series that are needed to develop the forces on early extracellular linkage : ( 1 ) myosinandactininteraction , ( 2 ) actinmonomerassemblyintoﬁla - ments , ( 3 ) actin ﬁlament binding to linker protein ( e . g . , talin ) , ( 4 ) linker binding to integrin , and ( 5 ) integrin binding to the ECM component . Thestrengthsofmanyoftheseconnectionsareeither unknown or poorly characterized ( Figure 2A ) . Actin ﬁlaments can withstand forces up to 110 pN ( Kishino and Yanagida , 1988 ) . In some cases , tropomyosin and cross - linking proteins strengthen actin ﬁlaments ( Liu and Bretscher , 1989 ; Tseng et al . , 2005 ) . For instance , the elastic modulus of actin ﬁlament gels increases from 1 . 2 to 99 pN / m m 2 in the presence of fascin and a - actinin ( Tseng et al . , 2005 ) . The speciﬁc strength of the linker / actin or linker / integrin bond is unclear , but there is an initial talin - mediated slip bond that releases at about 0 . 7 pN per ﬁbronectin ( 2 pN per ﬁbronectin trimer , Jiang et al . , 2003 ) . This likely represents the strength of talin’s initial bond to actin ﬁlaments that is subse - quentlyreinforcedbyadditionalactinbindingproteinslikevinculin . A number of reports suggest that the weakest link is not within the cell , but rather in the integrin bond to the ECM . The bond strength between a 5 b 1 integrin and ﬁbronectin has been by far the most studied . Reports have placed its strength as low as 0 . 1 pN or as high as 69 pN ( Table 2 ) . Higher estimates corre - spond to single molecule measurements , while lower values are average forces per molecule in measurements involving adhesions with multiple molecules ( compare values labeled ‘‘S’’ and ‘‘A’’ in Table 2 ) . The large discrepancy between both types of measurements suggests that most integrins in adhe - sions are not bound and that only a small fraction are sustaining forces in the tens of piconewtons .

Developmental Cell Review Cellular Forces Cells can exert protrusion and retraction forces . Protrusive forces by both ﬁlopodia and lamellipodia have been observed ( Prass et al . , 2006 ; Sheetz et al . , 1992 ) . Recently , it has been reported that the protrusion force of lamellipodial is between 20 and 80 pN / m m 2 ( Shahapure et al . , 2010 ) . However , protrusion forces are unlikely to mediate rigidity sensing , since integrins at the leading edge are not normally attached to ECM ligands ( Galbraith et al . , 2007 ; Schmidt et al . , 1993 ) . Conversely , retraction forces appear to be the relevant forces , since ligand binding causes in - tegrin association to the retrogradely ﬂowing actin ( Duband et al . , 1988 ; Felsenfeld et al . , 1996 ; Schmidtet al . , 1993 ) . Because microtubules are not involved in retraction forces , the relevant cellular motors are myosin and not kinesin nor dynein ( Cai et al . , 2010 ) . This agrees with ﬁndings that nonmuscle myosin II is required for the rigidity sensing of stem cells ( Engler et al . , 2006 ) . Contractile forces depend upon bipolar myosin ﬁlaments and a single myosin head generates between 1 . 3 and 5 pN of force ( Table 3 ) . During the retraction of cellular structures , the indi - vidual forces of myosins are additive and can reach up to 2 , 000 , 000 pN for a whole cell ( Table 4 ) . However , these larger forces are distributed over numerous integrin - matrix adhesion sites , begging the question of the amount of force felt on indi - vidual proteins . Patterned substrates of RGD have demon - strated that a spacing of (cid:1) 60 nm is sufﬁcient for strong binding ( Arnold et al . , 2004 ; Cavalcanti - Adam et al . , 2007 ; Koo et al . , 2002 ) , with smaller spacing having little additional effect . Thus , the 60 nm spacing ( corresponding to a density of approximately 300 integrin receptors per m m 2 ) can be regarded as character - izing the density of bound integrins in cells . The retraction forces on a known integrin substrate can reach up to 10 , 000 pN / m m 2 ( Table 4 ) . If we divide this number by the integrin density , this gives an estimate of approximately 30 pN per integrin bond . Complexes of three to ﬁve integrins are required in order to couple to the cytoskeleton ( Coussen et al . , 2002 ) and the adhe - sive force per matrix ligand can be 7 - fold higher with pentameric complexes ( Roca - Cusachs et al . , 2009 ) . Thus , an early adhesion complex may sustain on the order of 100 – 165 pN per adhesion unit . Others have used the maximum density of integrins and thus obtained a much lower force of 1 pN per integrin bond ( Balaban et al . , 2001 ) . Our estimate is based on the idea that Table 3 .

Developmental Cell 19 , August 17 , 2010 ª 2010 Elsevier Inc . 197 Developmental Cell Review only a fraction of integrins are engaged with the ECM , and it is consistent with the in vitro single molecule measurements of integrin - ECM strength ( Table 2 ) . Retraction Speeds and Loading Rates Cell retraction determines the rate at which force is applied to bonds and that affects how much force is required to break a bond either between or within proteins . Thus , the in vivo retrac - tion rates are important . The reported velocities of nonmuscle myosin IIa and IIb are 0 . 29 and 0 . 092 m m / s , respectively ( Pato et al . , 1996 ; Wang et al . , 2000a ) . In living cells , actin is trans - ported rearward at rates between 0 . 05 and 0 . 21 m m / s ( Fisher et al . , 1988 ; Forscher and Smith , 1988 ; Theriot and Mitchison , 1991 ) . These are very consistent with the reported velocities of integrin rearward movement , 0 . 08 – 0 . 23 m m / s ( Choquet et al . , 1997 ) . In a variety of cases , retraction rates can be as high as 0 . 6 m m / s when there are no or weak adhesions but drop to approximately 0 . 05 m m / s when adhesions occur ( Giannone et al . , 2004 ; Kress et al . , 2007 ; Zhang et al . , 2008 ) . In cells with adhesions that sense rigidity , the typical values for the loading rate then are in the range of 0 . 05 m m / s or less . Although loading rates of force over time have not been addressed directly , rough estimates based on published plots of the traction force over time indicate loading rates between 2 and 1 , 250 pN / ( s $ m m 2 ) ( Table 4 ; Burton et al . , 1999 ; du Roure et al . , 2005 ; Tan et al . , 2003 ) . Given that there could be up to 300 integrins per square micron ( see above ) , this translates to a loading rate of 0 . 007 to 4 pN / s on individual integrins . Mechanosensors How can the generation of force on the matrix be sensed ? There are 5 basic mechanisms that have been suggested for mechano - sensing through integrins : ( 1 ) catch bond formation , ( 2 ) channel opening , ( 3 ) enzyme regulation , ( 4 ) exposure of phosphorylation sites , or ( 5 ) exposure of binding sites . All could play signiﬁcant roles in adhesion - related processes . Catch Bonds As mentioned above , the lifetime of a bond generally shortens ( slips ) with applied force ; however , a subset of interactions ‘‘catch’’ ( strengthen ) under certain regimes of applied force . Two catch bonds have been described in the ECM connection to the cytoskeleton through integrins : one involving the binding of integrins with the ECM , the other between actin and myosin . Not much is known about the catch bond between myosin II and actin ﬁlaments , but it has been reported to have a maximum lifetime at 6 pN ( Guo and Guilford , 2006 ) . The catch bond between integrins and the ECM is far more studied . The idea of integrin involvement in the mechanosensing process was proposed originally by Ingber ( 1991 ) , and several reports have shown that extracellular rigidity causes strengthening of the integrin linkage ( Balaban et al . , 2001 ; Choquet et al . , 1997 ; Rive - line et al . , 2001 ) . Computer simulations have outlined the atomic - level mechanism of how mechanical force could increase the afﬁnity of integrins for their ligand ( Jin et al . , 2004 ; Puklin - Faucher et al . , 2006 ) . Lateral forces from the cytoskeleton onto integrins may induce structural changes that activate the catch bond ( Zhu et al . , 2008 ) . However , early work failed to observe a catch bond between a 5 b 1 integrin and ﬁbronectin ( Li et al . , 2003a ) . Recently , using a more sensitive atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) setup that maintained the force constant at values as low as 4 pN and a retraction rate of 0 . 2 m m / s ( close to physiolog - ical rates of (cid:1) 0 . 05 m m / s ) , a catch bond between integrin and ﬁbronectin was observed at forces of 10 – 30 pN ( Kong et al . , 2009 ) . Interestingly , this catch bond did not require straightening of the integrin tail region , as previously suspected ( Chigaev et al . , 2003 ) . The a 5 b 1 integrins bind to ﬁbronectin through two distinct sites : an RGD sequence and a ‘‘synergy’’ site . This catch bond functions , at least in part , through recruitment of the synergy binding site ( Friedland et al . , 2009 ) . Being the primary bond in the rigidity sensing process , the catch bond between the ECM and integrins has an elegant efﬁciency . However , as discussed below , additional components may be recruited to sense rigidity . Channel Opening In hearing , touch , and other mechanical senses , ion channels convert mechanical force into electrical and chemical signals ( Sukharev and Corey , 2004 ) . The classical case of force - depen - dent channel opening is in the hair cells of the auditory system . In such systems , force perpendicular to the membrane opens the channel . Similarly , cytoskeletal forces could pull on a channel associated with the early adhesion complex through lateral associations with the integrins . In endothelial cells , mechanical stress on integrin - bound beads causes calcium entry into cells within 2 – 5 s ( Matthews et al . , 2006 ) . Stretch activated ion - chan - nels have been reported to be important for traction forces at the leading edge , as well as vinculin and tyrosine phosphorylation accumulation at adhesion sites ( Munevar et al . , 2004 ) . However , the stretch - activated channels were not involved in the initial strengthening of the integrin - mediated link to the ECM , but rather in the later stages of cell repositioning ( > 60 s , Matthews et al . , 2006 ) . This is consistent with mechanosensitive ion channels requiring ﬁlamin recruitment ( Glogauer et al . , 1998 ) . Enzyme Regulation A number of enzymes are known to change their kinetics in response to mechanical stimulation ; these include kinases , phosphatases , adenylate cyclases , and GTPases ( Table 5 ) . A key question that has yet to be conclusively answered is whether mechanical force exerted on these proteins alters their function or whether altered kinetics reﬂects mechanical activa - tion of upstream or downstream effectors . A case for direct activation by mechanical force has been made for the kinase domain in titin ( Grater et al . , 2005 ) . However , its relevance to integrin - mediated rigidity is unclear . The strongest case for an enzyme regulated by force related to integrin rigidity sensing is focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) . FAK’s amino FERM domain has been proposed to inhibit its kinase activity ( Figure 3A ; Cooper et al . , 2003 ) . FAK does not bind to integrins directly , but its tyro - sine kinase activity increases with mechanical force ( Figure 3A and Table 5 ; Tomar and Schlaepfer , 2009 ) . This is particularly relevant because loss of FAK inhibits the ability of the cell to sense collagen rigidity ( Li et al . , 2002a ; Wang et al . , 2001b ) . A local but indirect mechanical activation has been proposed for the receptor - like protein tyrosine phosphatase - a ( RPTP a ) . This transmembrane phosphatase forms an autoinhibited dimer in which each of their helix - turn - helix wedges insert into the other’s catalytic cleft ( Jiang et al . , 2000 ; Tabernero et al . , 2008 ) that associates with a v b 3 integrins and becomes activated by restrained ﬁbronectin ( von Wichert et al . , 2003 ) . Moreover , it is known to activate Src family kinases ( SFKs ) , which are them - selves activated within approximately 300 ms after force 198 Developmental Cell 19 , August 17 , 2010 ª 2010 Elsevier Inc . Developmental Cell Review application on ﬁbronectin beads ( den Hertog et al . , 1993 ; Na et al . , 2008 ; Zheng et al . , 2000 ) , and to cause localization of the Src - family kinase fyn near the leading edge ( Kostic and Sheetz , 2006 ) . Exposing Phosphorylation Sites There is considerable evidence that cell stretching and matrix rigidity increases tyrosine phosphorylation of important proteins ( Glogauer et al . , 1997 ; Li et al . , 2002b ; Pelham and Wang , 1997 ; Schmidt et al . , 1998 ; Wang et al . , 2005 ) . An interesting observa - tion can be made when comparing mechanical responses of intact cells versus when their plasma membranes have been stripped away—intact cells ( but not stripped cells ) will respond to mechanical stimulus by activating Src family kinases ( Na et al . , 2008 ; Sawada et al . , 2006 ; Wang et al . , 2005 ) . Impor - tantly , mechanical stimulus in both cases leads to increased tyrosine phosphorylation . This not only reinforces the idea that the transmembrane phosphatase RPTP a is required for Src activation , but also suggests that there is increased availability of phosphorylation sites upon stretching . To date , only the Cas protein family has been proposed to undergo conforma - tional changes that expose phosphorylation sites ( Sawada et al . , 2006 ) . This protein family contains a substrate domain with multiple Src family kinase tyrosine phosphorylation sites ﬂanked by domains capable of binding a variety of proteins ( Figure 3B ; Geiger , 2006 ) . When incubated with active Src kinase , increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the substrate domain of p130Cas is observed upon stretch ( Sawada et al . , 2006 ) . Upon phosphorylation , the substrate domain of Cas becomes a docking site for a variety of proteins including Crk , Nck , and Ship2 ( Mayer et al . , 1995 ; Prasad et al . , 2001 ; Schlaepfer et al . , 1997 ) that then activate GTP exchange factors to locally form active small G - proteins such as Rap1 ( Tamada et al . , 2004 ) . More recent studies are supportive of a role for p130Cas in ﬁbronectin , but not collagen , rigidity sensing ( Kostic and Sheetz , 2006 ) . Exposing Protein Interaction Sites The other major mechanism for mechanotransduction is the exposure of protein - protein binding sites by stretch . In cells that have been stripped of their plasma membrane , stretching leads to the increased cytoskeleton binding of paxillin , focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) , p130Cas , PKB / Akt , C3G and CrkII ( Sawada and Sheetz , 2002 ; Tamada et al . , 2004 ) . Interestingly , myosin II contractility is required for the recruitment of FAK , zyxin , vinculin , and a - actinin , but not for the recruitment of paxillin , talin , and a 1 integrin ( Pasapera et al . , 2010 ) . Unfortu - nately , most of the direct protein - protein interactions are unclear . The only case where stretch - dependent binding of one protein to another has been documented is during stretching of talin , which leads to binding of vinculin ( del Rio et al . , 2009 ) . Talin has 11 potential vinculin binding sites , as well as binding sites for actin ﬁlaments , integrins , and a number of other proteins ( Figure 3C ) . Stretching of talin by mechanical forces therefore appears to play an important role in the reinforcement of early adhesions through the recruitment of additional actin binding proteins . Fibronectin is a major ECM protein that has been shown to expose protein interaction sites under mechanical strain ( Vogel , 2006 ) . Cellular contraction can expose cryptic sites in ﬁbronectin that are important for its assembly into a matrix ( Zhong et al . , 1998 ) . Thus , both intracellular and extracellular protein stretching may have important consequences . Is Protein Stretching Physiological ? A fundamental question in examining protein stretching as a mechanism of mechanotransduction is whether adhesion proteins can be stretched with physiological force . As outlined in the above sections , an estimate of the pulling force on individual integrins is on the order of 30 pN leading to between 100 and 165 pN on a minimal integrin adhesion complex of 3 – 5 integrins . Although stretching of titin , spectrin , and ankyrin have been studied extensively both in vitro and in silico Table 5 .

On the other hand , stretch - ing of talin to expose vinculin binding sites was initially estimated based on computer simulations to require 13 pN ( Lee et al . , 2007 ) . When AFM was used to measure this value directly , it took only 0 . 2 s for talin to unfold under a constant force of 20 pN ( del Rio et al . , 2009 ) . Another protein family that bridges integrins to actin is ﬁlamin ( Zhou et al . , 2010 ) . Filamins have an actin - binding domain followed by 24 immunoglobulin repeats and bind integrins through their C - terminal domain ( Figure 3D ) . Using AFM , the immunoglobulin repeats of ﬁlamin have been extended with 50 pN of force at a pulling speed of 0 . 37 m m / s ( Furuike et al . , 2001 ) . Focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) is another integrin - associated protein whose elasticity has been ad - dressed . The FAT domain is responsible for targeting FAK to focal adhesions ( Hildebrand et al . , 1993 ) . Computer simulations have predicted that the FAT domain of FAK will extend with under 75 pN of force ( Mofrad et al . , 2004 ) . From these data , it seems that the stretching of talin’s vinculin binding domain , ﬁlamin’s immunoglobulin domains , and poten - tially FAK’s FAT domain do occur at physiologically relevant forces . Moreover , direct support has been obtained by looking at the number of exposed cysteines in proteins ( Johnson et al . , 2007 ) . This technique has shown that in stretched live cells , nor - mally buried cysteines in vimentin and myosin IIa are exposed . Mechanisms of Rigidity Sensing Substrate rigidity inﬂuences a number of cellular processes including cell adhesion , actin ﬂow , retraction forces , gene expression , and cell lineage ( Bard and Hay , 1975 ; Choquet et al . , 1997 ; Engler et al . , 2006 ; Friedl and Brocker , 2000 ; Gian - none et al . , 2004 ; Lo et al . , 2000 ; Opas and Dziak , 1990 ; Pelham and Wang , 1997 ; Peyton and Putnam , 2005 ; Saez et al . , 2005 ; Yeung et al . , 2005 ) . However , in its most basic form , integrin - mediated rigidity sensing can be taken as the decision to couple and reinforce the link between an extracellular ligand and the cytoskeleton . For instance , ﬁbroblasts presented with ﬁbronectin - coated beads under restraining forces of 0 . 02 or 0 . 18 pN / nm will preferentially couple stiff beads to their cytoskel - eton ( Choquet et al . , 1997 ; Jiang et al . , 2006 ) . Whether integrin - cytoskeleton linkages become reinforced depends upon the mechanical properties of the microenvironment and the intracel - lular components that make up this link . Thus , rigidity responses depend upon both the nature of the matrix and the cell - type speciﬁc components involved in the responses . An early event after ligand binding to integrins involves the activation of Src family kinases ( potentially through mechanical effects on integrins that activate RPTP a , as mentioned above ) . This is supported by their rapid activation ( within 300 ms ) after applied force and the observation that the Src family kinases Fyn and Src are required for rigidity sensing on ﬁbronectin and vitronectin , respectively ( Felsenfeld et al . , 1999 ; Kostic and Sheetz , 2006 ; Na et al . , 2008 ) . Although the mechanism is unclear , the activation of Src family kinases leads to the bridging of integrins to the cytoskeleton through talin . This is supported by the observations that ligand binding couples integrins to the cytoskeleton and that talin is not required for SFK activation ( Duband et al . , 1988 ; Felsenfeld et al . , 1996 ; Schmidt et al . , 1993 ; Zhang et al . , 2008 ) . Once coupled to retrograde ﬂowing actin , mechanical force on integrins could engage the integrin / ECM catch bond . Force on talin could then expose vinculin binding sites that stabilize and recruit additional links to actin ( del Rio et al . , 2009 ) . Consistent with this possibility , myosin II contractility is required for vinculin but not for talin recruitment ( Pasapera et al . , 2010 ) . Finally , activation of FAK could reverse adhesions and restart the process . This is supported by observed roles of FAK in adhesion turnover and the requirement of talin in the activation of FAK ( Ilic et al . , 1995 ; Zhang et al . , 2008 ) . Thus , rigidity sensing is an active process that is transient and multiple steps could be sensitive to the matrix rigidity ( Figure 4A ) . In such a model , substrate rigidity determines the loading rate felt on the integrin - ECM catch bond . Just as catch bonds have a force providing maximum lifetime in a scenario of constant force application , they will have a corresponding optimal loading Figure 3 . Mechanosensory Proteins in Integrin - Mediated Rigidity Sensing Proteins that bind directly to the depicted domains are highlighted in yellow boxes . ( A ) FAK does not bind integrins or actin directly , but its kinase activity is regulated by mechanical force , and it has been hypothesized that removal of the FERM domain from the kinase could play a role ( Cooper et al . , 2003 ) . ( B ) The substrate domain of p130Cas contains 15 tyrosine residues that become exposed upon stretching ( Sawada et al . , 2006 ) . ( C ) Stretching of talin’s rod domain exposes vinculin binding sites ( del Rio et al . , 2009 ) . ( D ) Extension of ﬁlamin immunoglobulin repeats ( labeled 1 – 24 ) has been shownbyAFM ( Furuike etal . , 2001 ) andcouldregulatethebindingofproteins . ( E ) a - actinin forms antiparallel dimers ; mechanical force could regulate this dimerization or its association with other proteins . 200 Developmental Cell 19 , August 17 , 2010 ª 2010 Elsevier Inc . Developmental Cell Review rate in scenarios where force is loaded progressively . Thus , at the optimal rigidity , the loading rate will maximize bond lifetime , providing the opportunity for the applied force to trigger subse - quent mechanotransduction events . Regardless of the particular model for mechanotransduction , coupling between rearward ﬂowing actin and the substrate is key for rigidity sensing . Detail - ing the temporal series of mechanosensory events in rigidity sensing will require clever experimental setups that merge high - resolution imaging and sensitive force - sensing techniques . Rigidity Sensing Based on 100 nm Displacement Events ? When integrins bind to matrix , there is evidence that rigidity sensing involves uniform displacements of the substrate . If epithelial cells are grown on pillars with spring constants ranging from 1 to 100 pN / nm , they displace the pillars by (cid:1) 130 nm regardless of their stiffness ( Saez et al . , 2005 ) . Similarly , when ﬁbroblasts are presented with beads in a laser tweezers force ramp of 0 . 02 or 0 . 18 pN / nm , the beads in the softer tweezers are more likely to be released from the cytoskeleton ( Jiang et al . , 2006 ) . If , however , the softer beads were moved in the tweezers to produce 10 – 20 pN of force within 100 nm of the initial position , reinforcement occurred as with the stiffer beads . There - fore , cells appear to sense rigidity based on whether a threshold force is obtained within a given displacement of approximately 100 – 150 nm . This raises the question of what limits the distance of the sensing event . If we consider a ﬁbronectin - a 5 b 1 catch bond acting at the force that provides maximum lifetime ( 20 pN ) , the substrate rigidity needed to cause a displacement of 100 nm is on the order of 10 nN / m m 2 and therefore in the rigidity range of several different tissues ( Box 1 and Table 1 ) . However , as the substrate rigidity is changed , so will the displacement events , which are not what has been observed experimentally ( Saez et al . , 2005 ) . Therefore , a mechanism involving more than a catch bond is presumably necessary . One possibility is that this distance represents the stretching of a mechanosensor linking the integrin complex to a reference structure within the cell . Proteins are typically folded into domains of 2 . 5 nm containing 200 amino acids ( Bao , 2009 ) . If we assume that the maximum extension per amino acid is 0 . 4 nm ( Ainavarapu et al . , 2007 ) , a domain of only 200 amino acids could be stretched to 80 nm—in others words , by 32 times its original length and close to the observed displacement of 100 nm . A portion of 407 amino acids from talin’s rod domain ( containing 5 of its 11 potential vinculin binding sites ) increases its length by 140 nm upon the application of force ( del Rio et al . , 2009 ) . Thus extension of intracellular proteins is within the range of the observed displacements of approximately 100 nm . A ﬁnal point that emerges if protein stretching underlies the uniform displacement events is that it requires attachment to a reference structure . Potential reference structures within the cell include the actin polymerization complex or a rigid actin network ( Figures 4B and 4C ) . In regard to the latter possibility , two overlapping actin networks are seen at the periphery of cells ( Giannone et al . , 2007 ; Ponti et al . , 2004 ) . For simplicity , these rigidity - sensing models are based on only single integrin Figure 4 . The Rigidity Sensing Cycle and Models for Uniform Displacements ( A ) A possible rigidity sensing cycle involves three mechanosensory events : ( 1 ) integrin / ECM catch bond formation , ( 2 ) stretching of talin that rein - forces the adhesion by recruiting vinculin , and ( 3 ) stretching of FAK that activates its kinase domain leading to the disassembly and recycling of the adhesion . ( B and C ) Two models to explain the uniform displacements of approximately 100 nm , one in whichthereferencestructureisthepolymerizationcomplex ( B ) , and the other in which a stable actin network provides the reference structure ( C ) . In both models , the key decision is based on whether the extension of the link to retrograde ﬂowing actin ( e . g . , talin ) occurs before the link to the reference structure is broken . Box 1 . Estimating Optimal Rigidity for an Integrin - ECM Catch Bond Engagement with an Optimal Loading of 20 pN To evaluate the order of magnitude of the rigidity that would likely result in a displacement of (cid:1) 100 nm , we did the following calculation . We considered a minimal adhesion complex with three integrins spaced 60 nm from one another , each exerting a force of 20 pN . We thus assumed a total force ( F ) of 60 pN , which for simplicity we modeled as a single point force exerted in the middle of three integrins located at a distance ( x ) of 30 nm from the source . The displacement d in a material of shear modulus G caused by such a point force as a function of the distance to the source x ( along the direction of force application ) is d = F / ( 2 p Gx ) ( Landau et al . , 1986 ) . If we consider a displacement ( d ) of 100 nm , we can calculate the corresponding shear modulus as G = F / ( 2 p dx ) . By assuming an incompressible material with a Poisson ratio of 0 . 5 where the elastic modulus is 3 3 the shear modulus , then E = 3 G = 3 F / ( 2 p dx ) z 10 nN / m m 2 . Given the assumptions and approximations , this value should be taken only as an estimate of the order of magnitude involved , but it does provide a useful guide to the range of rigidities for which such a conﬁg - uration would be tuned . Developmental Cell 19 , August 17 , 2010 ª 2010 Elsevier Inc . 201 Developmental Cell Review receptors . As discussed above , complexes of three to ﬁve integ - rins act synergistically ( Coussen et al . , 2002 ) . Integrin multimeri - zation may initiate downstream signaling and be an integral part of the rigidity sensing machinery ( Li et al . , 2003b ; Paszek et al . , 2005 ) . Thus , more complicated models involving integrin multi - merizaiton and potentially mechanosensory proteins that bridge integrins may be necessary . Conclusion In summary , the mechanism of integrin - mediated rigidity sensing is constrained by physical characteristics of the cytoskeleton - in - tegrin - matrix link . Relevant factors include the force and loading rate that cells employ to probe the substrate , the sensitivity of their mechanotransduction system , and the strength of their attachment to the ECM . Current measurements indicate that the liganded integrins move rearward at about 50 nm / s and can support on the order of 30 pN per bond . Although integrin - matrix catch bonds can explain reduced adhesion to soft surfaces and cell rounding , they cannot explain the observed uniform displacements over a wide range of rigidity . If displace - ments of approximately 100 nm are indeed important elements of the rigidity - sensing process of cells , a key challenge will be to identify the structure that provides the reference point . We focused here on rigidity sensing through integrins . How - ever , tissue rigidity can inﬂuence cellular behavior through cad - herin - mediated adhesions ( Tsai and Kam , 2009 ) . Little is known of the rigidity sensing mediated through cell - cell or other ECM receptors ; however , recently it has been shown that mechanical forces regulate adherens’ cell - cell junction size ( Liu et al . , 2010 ) . Because other transmembrane receptors are bridged to the cytoskeleton through many of the same intracellular proteins , it is likely that similar rigidity - sensing mechanisms exist . Finally , an important gap in our knowledge is how the short - term rigidity sensing described here is translated into the long - term rigidity sensing involved in cell differentiation . Although much may be shared between the two processes , they may have radically different time constants and frequencies . In ﬁbroblasts , there are periodic pulls on the matrix that produce early adhesions every 24 s ( Giannone et al . , 2004 ) . However , it is not evident that stem cells test the rigidity of the environment in the same way and with the same frequency over the full period of differentiation that can take 7 days or more . Thus , it remains a key challenge to link the early rigidity mechanisms described here to the long - term processes involved in cellular differentiation . REFERENCES Ainavarapu , S .
