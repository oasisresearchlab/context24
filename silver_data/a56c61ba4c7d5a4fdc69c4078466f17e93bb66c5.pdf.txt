Silver and copper ions at relatively high concentra(cid:1) tions are toxic for microorganisms and are thus widely used as bactericides and fungicides . The mechanism of their effect on bacterial cells has been studied for a long time [ 1(cid:1)9 ] , yet it cannot be considered as fully estab(cid:1) lished . The primary targets of these inorganic cations are thought to be various transport systems of the plasma membrane , including transport systems of phosphate [ 5 , 6 ] and K + [ 7 ] . Copper ions are cofactors of some enzymes ; therefore , yeast cells possess transport systems that provide their uptake and efflux [ 1(cid:1)4 ] . Special trans(cid:1) port systems for Ag + are still unknown . In this work , we have compared the effects of Ag + and Cu 2 + and the natu(cid:1) ral fungicide 2(cid:1)O(cid:1)3(cid:1)hydroxyhexanoyl(cid:1) β (cid:1)D(cid:1)glucopyra(cid:1) nosyl(cid:1) ( 1 → 4 ) (cid:1) ( 6(cid:1)O(cid:1)acetyl(cid:1) β (cid:1)D(cid:1)glucopyranosyl(cid:1) ( 1 → 16 ) (cid:1) 2 , 15 , 16(cid:1)trihydroxyhexadecanoic acid ) ( cellobiose lipid , CL ) on K + efflux from cells and spheroplasts of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae , as well as on the activity of H + (cid:1) ATPase , the main enzyme responsible for energization of the plasma membrane in these microorganisms . MATERIALS AND METHODS The yeast S . cerevisiae VKM Y(cid:1)1173 was cultivated at 29°C in Reader medium [ 10 ] with 2 % glucose to the logarithmic growth phase . The yeast cells were rinsed with distilled water , centrifuged at 5000 g for 15 min , and resuspended in water . Then they were used for measuring K + efflux and H + (cid:1)ATPase activity and for isolation of spheroplasts . Spheroplasts were obtained by treating cells with lyophilized gastric juice of edible snails in 5 % citric buffer with 0 . 8 M mannitol , pH 6 . 5 . After the treatment , they were washed twice with the same buffer . The efflux of K + was measured upon addition of 20 µM AgNO 3 and 100 µM CuSO 4 , as well as 0 . 4 mM natural fungicide CL produced by the yeast Pseudozyma fusiformata VKM Y(cid:1)2821 ( All(cid:1)Russian Collection of Microorganisms ) .

Copper ions and the natural fungicide 2(cid:1)O(cid:1)3(cid:1)hydroxyhexanoyl(cid:1) β (cid:1)D(cid:1)glucopyranosyl(cid:1) ( 1 → 4 ) (cid:1) ( 6(cid:1)O(cid:1)acetyl(cid:1) β (cid:1)D(cid:1)glucopyranosyl(cid:1) ( 1 → 16 ) (cid:1)2 , 15 , 16(cid:1)trihydroxyhexadecanoic acid ) induce the efflux of potassium ions from both cells and spheroplasts of S . cerevisiae . Silver and copper ions inhibit the activity of the plasma membrane H + (cid:1)ATPase during the treat(cid:1) ment of both cells and spheroplasts . It is supposed that the inability of silver ions to stimulate potassium efflux from sphero(cid:1) plasts results from damage to some components of K + transport systems during preparation of spheroplasts .

The efflux of K + from yeast cells was registered with a K + (cid:1)selective glass electrode ( Orion , USA ) . The meas(cid:1) urements were performed in a 2 . 5(cid:1)ml cell at 25°C under stirring . The medium contained 0 . 02 M Mes(cid:1)Tris buffer , pH 7 . 0 ( in the case of Cu 2 + or Ag + ) , or 0 . 01 M citrate(cid:1) phosphate buffer , pH 4 . 0 ( in the case of Ag + or CL ) . In the experiments with spheroplasts , buffer solutions con(cid:1) tained 0 . 8 M mannitol . The experiments with cells were performed both in the presence and absence of this osmotic stabilizer . The final concentration of cells or spheroplasts was ( 6 . 0(cid:1)6 . 5 ) ·10 8 per ml . The charge on the surface of cells and spheroplasts was estimated by their electrophoretic mobility using a Parmoquant(cid:1)2 microscope ( Carl Zeiss , Germany ) at 20°C . The electrokinetic potential ( EKP ) was calculated using the Smolukhovsky equation without taking into account the effects of surface polarization . Before meas(cid:1) urement , cells or spheroplasts ( 5·10 6 per ml ) were sus(cid:1) pended in 0 . 01 M citrate(cid:1)phosphate buffer , pH 4 . 0 , with 0 . 8 M mannitol and incubated for 15 min at 20°C . The mean EKP values and the mean square deviations were determined for 25 cells in each sample , and EKP his(cid:1) tograms for cells and spheroplasts were plotted . The EKP values of both populations in mannitol were corrected for the viscosity of water at 20°C . For determination of the effects of Ag + and Cu 2 + on H + (cid:1)ATPase activity , the cells and spheroplasts were incu(cid:1) bated at 30°C for 20 min with 20 µM AgNO 3 or CuSO 4 , centrifuged , and resuspended in 10 ml of 0 . 01 M Mes(cid:1) NaOH buffer , pH 6 . 5 , with 10 % sorbitol , 0 . 1 M KCl , and 4 mM MgSO 4 , followed by addition of 0 . 5 ml of 1 % Triton X(cid:1)100 and freezing in liquid nitrogen . The experi(cid:1) ments with spheroplasts were performed under the same conditions but with 0 . 8 M mannitol present in all solu(cid:1) tions . Freezing in liquid nitrogen in the presence of 1 % Triton X(cid:1)100 followed by thawing results in an increase in unspecific permeability of the plasma membrane and is useful for the assay of plasma membrane ATPase activity [ 12 ] . Before the assay of H + (cid:1)ATPase activity , the samples were thawed on ice , centrifuged , and resuspended in 2 ml of the same buffer without Triton X(cid:1)100 . ( In case of spheroplasts , the buffer contained 0 . 8 M mannitol . ) For measuring the ATPase activity , 50 µl of cell suspension was added to 0 . 95 ml of the same buffer containing 5 mM MgSO 4 and ATP and incubated for 30 min at 30°C either with or without 100 µM Na 3 VO 4 . Orthovanadate is a spe(cid:1) cific inhibitor of P(cid:1)ATPases including H + (cid:1)ATPase of yeast plasma membrane [ 13 , 14 ] , and the level of vana(cid:1) date(cid:1)sensitive hydrolysis of ATP was used to determine its activity . After centrifugation at 13 , 000 g for 3 min , 100(cid:1)µl samples were taken from the supernatant and P i was assayed using malachite green dye as described earlier [ 12 ] . The reaction was carried out on microplates for immunoenzyme analysis at 30°C for 10 min on an ELMI Sky Line shaker . Absorbance was measured at 650 nm with an Efos(cid:1)9305 immunoenzyme plate photometer ( Russia ) . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Silver ions induced fast efflux of K + from S . cerevi(cid:1) siae cells ( Fig . 1a ) . The total level of intracellular K + in the yeast was the same under treatment with 20 µM Ag + and under heating at 70°C for 15 min in a water bath . So , Ag + provides nearly complete release of K + from yeast cells according to the literature data [ 5 , 6 ] . The effect of Ag + was similar at pH 4 . 0 and 7 . 0 . The efflux of K + from cells was independent of the presence or absence of 0 . 8 M mannitol in the incubation medium . However , during the treatment of spheroplasts with Ag + , efflux of K + was prac(cid:1) tically not observed ( Fig . 1b ) . The treatment of cells with 20 µM AgNO 3 in deionized water also induced K + efflux . However , the treatment of spheroplasts with AgNO 3 in 0 . 8 M mannitol was ineffective . Fig . 1 .

BIOCHEMISTRY ( Moscow ) Vol . 73 No . 11 2008 Control experiments were performed with Cu 2 + , the effect of which on yeast cells is well studied [ 1(cid:1)9 ] . These ions in the concentrations used disturb the barrier func(cid:1) tion of plasma membrane and induce leakage of K + , amino acids , and nucleotides [ 15 ] . Copper ions , in con(cid:1) trast to Ag + , induce K + efflux from cells ( both in the pres(cid:1) ence and absence of 0 . 8 M mannitol ) and spheroplasts ( in the presence of 0 . 8 M mannitol ) with similar efficiency , but only at pH 7 . 0 ( Fig . 1 ) . The effect of the natural fungicide CL inhibiting cell growth at pH 4 . 0 [ 11 ] on cells and spheroplasts was exam(cid:1) ined . This compound induces leakage of ATP from yeast cells , acting as a detergent that destroys the plasma mem(cid:1) brane [ 11 ] . This glycolipid fungicide induces K + efflux at 10 times lower concentration than is known for the deter(cid:1) gent SDS [ 16 , 17 ] . The efflux of K + from cells and sphero(cid:1) plasts was observed at similar concentrations of this com(cid:1) pound ( Fig . 1 , a and b ) . In the case of cells , exclusion of mannitiol from the incubation medium did not affect this efflux ( not shown ) . Thus , only Ag + was ineffective in the case of spheroplasts . The data are in agreement with the opinion that Cu 2 + and CL [ 11 , 15 ] cause K + efflux by destroying the barrier function of the plasma membrane . In this case , the pres(cid:1) ence of cell wall is not necessary . Supposing that insensitivity of spheroplasts to Ag + may be due to the change in surface charge after the removal of the cell wall , we determined the EKP values of cells and spheroplasts . These values characterize the neg(cid:1) ative charge on the cell / spheroplast surface . The mean values of EKP were – 12 . 88 ± 0 . 40 and – 7 . 52 ± 0 . 76 mV for cells and spheroplasts , respectively . For spheroplasts , increase in heterogeneity of EKP values is typical as com(cid:1) pared with cells ( Fig . 2 ) . The decrease in EKP of sphero(cid:1) plasts is explained by the loss of negatively charged com(cid:1) ponents such as polyphosphates and polysaccharides on elimination of the cell envelope [ 18 ] . The decrease in surface charge may be one of the factors causing the absence of K + efflux on the treatment of spheroplasts by Ag + . So , we compared the effect of Ag + and Cu 2 + on an integral protein of plasma membrane , H + (cid:1)ATPase , under treatment of cells and spheroplasts with these ions . The ATPase activity was assayed in situ after cell per(cid:1) meabilization as described in section “Materials and Methods” . It turned out that both cations inhibited H + (cid:1) ATPase to the same extent ( see table ) . Thus , the changes in the surface charge on preparation of spheroplasts had no effect on the interaction of Ag + and H + (cid:1)ATPase . The inability of Ag + to induce K + efflux from sphero(cid:1) plasts is probably explained by changes in transport sys(cid:1) tems involved in K + homeostasis after elimination of the cell wall . The K + homeostasis system of yeast cells involves proteins that provide both uptake and efflux [ 19 , 20 ] . We suggest that , in contrast to Cu 2 + or CL , which induce K + release through destruction of the barrier func(cid:1) tion of plasma membrane , Ag + affects proteins responsi(cid:1) ble for K + efflux . During preparation of spheroplasts , these components are eliminated and no K + efflux is observed . Such effects , therefore , should be taken into consideration when spheroplasts are used as a model for studying the processes of transport across the yeast plas(cid:1) ma membrane .
