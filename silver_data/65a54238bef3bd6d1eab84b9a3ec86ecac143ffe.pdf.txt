ABSTRACT The epithelial - mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) represents a cellular de - differentiation process that provides cells with the increased plasticity required during embryonic development , tissue remodeling , wound healing and metastasis . Slug and Twist are two key EMT transcription factors ( EMT - TFs ) that are tightly regulated via ubiquitination and degradation . How Slug and Twist escape degradation and become stabilized in cancer cells remains unclear . One plausible mechanism of Slug and Twist stabilization involves removal of ubiquitin by deubiquitinases ( DUBs ) . In this study , we identified Dub3 as a novel DUB for both Slug and Twist . We further found that Dub3 overexpression increased Slug and Twist protein levels in a dose - dependent manner , whereas Dub3 - knockdown decreased their protein levels . Of importance , Dub3 interacted with Slug and Twist and prevented them from degradation , thereby promoting migration , invasion , and cancer stem cell ( CSC ) - like properties of breast cancer cells . Intriguingly , Dub3 was identified as an early response gene that was upregulated after exposure to inflammatory cytokines such as IL - 6 , which plays a critical role in the growth and metastasis of breast cancer cells , as well as the maintenance of breast CSCs . We found that Dub3 played an essential role in IL - 6 induced EMT through stabilization of Slug and Twist . Our study has uncovered an IL - 6 - Dub3 - Slug / Twist signaling axis during EMT and suggests potential approaches that could target Dub3 to prevent metastatic breast tumor . INTRODUCTION Originally recognized as a vital cellular process during embryonic morphogenesis , EMT has been linked to pathologies including fibrosis and cancer progression , due to the similarities in the migratory and invasive characteristics that the cells obtain during these processes [ 1 - 4 ] . Indeed , growing evidence indicates that EMT endows tumor cells with CSC - like traits , renders them resistant to therapeutics and provides them with www . impactjournals . com / oncotarget / Oncotarget , 2017 , Vol . 8 , ( No . 43 ) , pp : 75127 - 75140 Research Paper Oncotarget 75128 www . impactjournals . com / oncotarget proclivity for early metastasis . While EMT is required for dissociation of tumor cells from primary carcinomas and their subsequent migration and dissemination , it is the reversal process mesenchymal - epithelial transition ( MET ) , that directs tumor cells to regain epithelial properties and proliferate at metastatic sites [ 5 , 6 ] . Not surprisingly , EMT is executed and tightly regulated in response to different levels of signaling integrative of transcriptional control , epigenetic modifications as well as protein stability and subcellular localization [ 2 , 7 - 15 ] . Classical EMT - TFs fall into three groups : Snail family zinc finger proteins ( Snail / Snail1 and Slug / Snail2 ) ; Twist family basic helix - loop - helix ( bHLH ) proteins ( Twist / Twist1 and Twist2 ) ; and ZEB family two - handed zinc finger / homeodomain proteins ( ZEB1 and ZEB2 / SIP - 1 ) . Aberrant expression / activation of EMT - TFs can give rise to tumor angiogenesis , invasion and metastasis , confer tumor cells with CSC - like properties as well as resistance to apoptosis . For example , our previous studies along with others’ demonstrated that Snail expression correlates with tumor grade and nodal metastasis of invasive ductal carcinoma [ 14 , 16 ] ; and Slug overexpression prior to neoplastic transformation predisposes BRCA1 - mutation carriers to aggressive basal - like breast cancer ( BLBC ) [ 17 ] ; and Twist is highly expressed in invasive lobular carcinoma [ 18 ] . EMT - TFs are under multiple layers of control . With respect to protein stability , the Snail family members and Twist are extremely labile proteins subject to poly - ubiquitination and degradation mediated by E3 ubiquitin ligases including β - TrCP , Fbxl14 , Fbxl5 , Fbxo11 and Mdm2 [ 19 ] . Ubiquitination is a reversible process , as ubiquitin moieties can be removed from proteins by deubiquitinases ( DUBs ) . DUBs consist of five enzyme families : ubiquitin - specific proteases ( USPs ) , ubiquitin C - terminal hydrolases ( UCHs ) , Machado - Josephin domain proteases ( MJDs ) , ovarian tumor proteases ( OTUs ) and Jab1 / Mov34 / MPN + ( JAMM ) domain - containing metalloenzymes . Recent studies demonstrated that DUBs play essential roles in cancer development through regulation of transcription , DNA repair and cell cycle progression [ 20 ] . As such , DUBs have emerged as promising targets of anti - cancer therapies [ 21 ] . It is speculative yet interesting to find out whether ubiquitination of Snail family and Twist transcription factors is counteracted by DUBs under specific conditions , such that these transcription factors escape degradation and become stabilized to promote EMT and metastasis . As a member of USPs , Dub3 is an immediate early gene whose transcription can be rapidly induce by cytokines [ 20 , 22 , 23 ] . Importantly , high expression of Dub3 in mouse embryonic stem cells ( ESCs ) couples the G1 / S checkpoint with pluripotency through Cdc25A de - ubiquitination , and Dub3 depletion reduces the proliferative potential of breast cancer cells in vivo by degradation of Cdc25A [ 24 , 25 ] . In the current study , we identified Dub3 as a new DUB of Slug and Twist . We found that Dub3 interacted with and stabilized Slug and Twist through de - ubiquitination . Furthermore , we demonstrated that Dub3 promoted migration , invasion and CSC - like properties of breast cancer cells . Together , our study identifies a novel role of Dub3 in inducing EMT through Slug and Twist stabilization , and strengthens the potential of Dub3 as an anti - cancer drug target . RESULTS Dub3 stabilizes Slug and Twist To identify specific DUBs involved in mediating protein stability of the Slug , we performed a screening of siRNA library targeting the 99 known or putative DUBs . Based on the initial screening , we identified two potential candidates , USP28 and Dub3 ( data not shown ) . However , we found that only Dub3 , but not USP28 , interacted with Slug ( top panel , Figure 1A ) . When Dub3 was co - expressed with Slug in HEK293 cells , we found that Dub3 significantly increased protein levels of Slug , an effect comparable to treatment with proteasome inhibitor MG132 ( top panel , Figure 1B ) . Because degradation of both Slug and Twist is mediated by β - TrCP1 and Fbxl14 , and DUBs usually counteract E3 ligases to stabilize their target proteins , we asked whether Dub3 also stabilizes Twist . Surprisingly , Dub3 also significantly increased Twist protein ( bottom panel , Figure 1B ) . In contrast , a Dub3 mutant , in which the catalytic cysteine was replaced with serine ( C89S , CS ) , had no effect on Slug / Twist protein levels , indicating that Dub3 enzymatic activity is required for Slug / Twist stabilization ( Figure 1C ) . Similar to Slug , Twist also interacted with Dub3 but not USP28 ( bottom panel , Figure 1A ) . In addition , when we co - expressed Slug / Twist with increasing amounts of Dub3 in HEK293 cells , the levels of Slug and Twist increased in a Dub3 dose - dependent manner ( Figure 1D ) . To test whether endogenous Slug and Twist are subject to similar regulation , we knocked down Dub3 expression in basal - like breast cancer ( BLBC ) cells MDA - MB157 and SUM159 and found that the protein levels of Slug and Twist , rather than mRNA levels of these two molecules , significantly decreased in these cells ( Figure 1E ) . This excludes the possibility that Dub3 indirectly regulates transcription rather than protein stability of Slug and Twist . Furthermore , MG132 treatment restored the downregulation of Slug and Twist in Dub3 - knockdown MDA - MB157 cells ( Figure 1F ) . Collectively , our data indicated that Dub3 is involved in mediating the protein stability of Slug and Twist . Dub3 interacts with Slug and Twist To further define the mechanism of Dub3 - mediated Slug and Twist stabilization , we performed co - immunoprecipitation ( Co - IP ) experiment using HEK293 cells expressing both Myc - Dub3 and Flag - Slug or HA - Twist . After IP of Dub3 , we detected associated Oncotarget 75129 www . impactjournals . com / oncotarget Figure 1 : Dub3 stabilized Slug and Twist . ( A ) Flag - tagged Slug and HA - tagged DUBs or HA - Twist and Flag - tagged DUBs were co - expressed in HEK293 cells . After immunoprecipitation , bound Slug or Twist was examined by western blot .

Oncotarget 75130 www . impactjournals . com / oncotarget Slug / Twist , and vice versa ( Figure 2A ) . Concurrently , we also performed endogenous Co - IP and confirmed the association of Dub3 with Slug and Twist in MDA - MB157 and SUM159 cells ( Figure 2B ) . The Dub3 - Slug / Twist interaction was further supported by immunofluorescence ( IF ) analysis , as Myc - Dub3 co - localized with GFP - Slug or GFP - Twist in the nuclei of HEK293 cells ( Figure 2C ) . Dub3 deubiquitinates Slug and Twist To test the effect of Dub3 on the protein stability of Slug and Twist , we co - expressed Slug / Twist with Dub3 or vector control in HEK293 cells and treated cells with cycloheximide ( CHX ) at different time intervals to block newly synthesized protein . Both Slug and Twist proteins became significantly stabilized in presence of Dub3 compared to vector control group ( Figure 3A ) . Consistently , CHX chase experiments showed that endogenous Slug and Twist became unstable and degraded rapidly upon knockdown of Dub3 in MDA - MB157 cells ( Figure 3B ) . In Slug or Twist expressing HEK293 cells treated with MG132 , IP of Slug / Twist showed that both proteins were heavily ubiquitinated ( lane 1 of both upper panels , Figure 3C ) . Co - expression of wild - type ( WT ) Dub3 almost completely abolished ubiquitination of Slug and Twist , while co - expression of CS - Dub3 did not show this effect ( lane 2 vs lane 3 in both upper panels , Figure 3C ) . Conversely , the level of Slug and Twist ubiquitination was significantly increased upon Dub3 - knockdown in MDA - MB157 and SUM159 cells ( Figure 3D ) . Taken together , our results demonstrated that Slug and Twist associate with Dub3 and are subject to Dub3 - mediated de - ubiquitination , which contributes to their protein stabilization . Dub3 mediates migration , invasion and CSC - like properties of breast cancer cells To investigate the function of Dub3 in breast cancer , we established stable MDA - MB157 and SUM159 cells with knockdown of Dub3 expression . Dub3 - knockdown increased the expression of epithelial markers E - cadherin and Claudin - 7 , while down - regulating mesenchymal molecules N - cadherin and Vimentin ( Figure 4A ) . In addition , both cells with Dub3 - knockdown showed reduced levels of molecules associated with BLBC such as CK5 , EGFR , SPARC and Caveolin - 1 , and gained expression of luminal markers such as CK18 and ERα ( Figure 4B ) . We then performed migration and invasion assays and found that Dub3 - knockdown significantly decreased migratory and invasive capabilities of MDA - MB157 and SUM159 cells ( Figure 4C - 4D ) . Furthermore , to assess the effect of Dub3 in regulating CSC - like properties , we performed tumorsphere - formation assays and found that Dub3 - knockdown dramatically reduced the number and size of tumorspheres in MDA - MB157 and SUM159 cells ( Figure 4E ) . To further investigate the roles of Dub3 , we examined whether Dub3 expression can confer luminal breast cancer cells with EMT phenotypes . MCF7 and T47D cells are typical luminal cells with little endogenous Dub3 expression . Expression of Dub3 in these two cell lines dramatically increased the levels of Slug and Twist ( Figure 5A ) and reduced E - cadherin and ER expression . Concomitantly , Dub3 expression induced significant morphology changes as cells turned into a scattered appearance indicative of EMT ( Figure 5B ) . As expected , Dub3 expression dramatically enhanced the migratory and invasive capabilities of both MCF7 and T47D cells ( Figure 5C - 5D ) . However , CS - Dub3 lost the ability to increase cell migration and invasion in these cells . Together these results indicated that Dub3 is a critical EMT - promoting factor that can increase migration , invasion and CSC - like properties of breast cancer cells . Dub3 is critical for IL - 6 - induced EMT Dub3 was identified as an early response gene that can be induced by IL - 6 [ 22 , 23 ] . Importantly , IL - 6 can induce EMT through the STAT3 signaling , and its level increases with higher breast tumor grade and correlates with metastasis and poor patient survival [ 26 , 27 ] . To test whether IL - 6 promotes EMT through induction of Dub3 and subsequently results in Slug and Twist stabilization , we treated SUM159 cells with IL - 6 at different time intervals . Consistent with previous findings , Dub3 was rapidly induced after one hour of IL - 6 stimulation , which was accompanied by an increase of Slug and Twist protein levels ( Figure 6A ) . In contrast , Dub3 - knockdown almost completely abolished IL - 6 induced Slug and Twist upregulation in SUM159 cells ( Figure 6B ) . We also found that a Dub3 inhibitor , WP1130 , can dramatically suppress Slug and Twist upregulation induced by IL - 6 while PR619 ( a deubiquitinating enzyme inhibitor ) was less effective in SUM159 cells ( Figure 6C ) [ 28 , 29 ] . Furthermore , Dub3 - knockdown or WP1130 treatment significantly inhibited IL - 6 - mediated invasion of tumor cells ( Figure 6D ) ; however , WP1130 could not suppress IL - 6 - induced invasion in Dub3 - knockdown cells . Together , these data support the idea that Dub3 functions as a molecule sensor , which can stabilize Slug / Twist and induce EMT in responding to microenvironmental IL - 6 stimulation . Dub3 , Slug and Twist are coordinately expressed in breast tumors To find out whether the expression of Dub3 , Slug and Twist are correlated in breast cancer , we examined their expression in multiple breast cancer cell lines and tumor specimens . As expected , Dub3 , Slug and Twist levels are coordinately high in BLBC cell lines compared to luminal breast cancer cell lines ( Figure 7A ) . We also performed immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) analysis to examine their expression in primary breast tumor specimens . Although Oncotarget 75131 www . impactjournals . com / oncotarget Figure 2 : Dub3 interacts with Slug and Twist . ( A ) Flag - Slug or HA - Twist was co - expressed with Myc - Dub3 in HEK293 cells .

Oncotarget 75132 www . impactjournals . com / oncotarget we could not detect Slug expression in these tumor samples due to the lack of specific antibodies , we found a significant correlation of Dub3 and Twist in terms of protein intensity and distribution in these breast tumor specimens ( Figure 7B ) . The tumor - staining data support our findings in cell - culture experiments and further strengthen our notion that Dub3 is a critical deubiquitinase in stabilizing Slug and Twist in breast cancer .

Oncotarget 75134 www . impactjournals . com / oncotarget DISCUSSION Metastasis remains a daunting threat , as approximately 90 % of cancer deaths are caused by the spread of tumor cells to other organs [ 30 ] . BLBC carries the poorest prognosis among breast cancer subtypes , given its tendency toward early and recurrent metastasis and lack of effective targeted therapies [ 31 - 35 ] . BLBC intrinsically activates EMT in response to various signaling from microenvironment , particularly those from inflammatory cytokines . Similar to many transcription factors , such as p53 and HIF1α , EMT - TFs like Snail , Slug and Twist are often subjected to ubiquitination / degradation and have very short half - lives . Several ubiquitin ligases have so far been linked to the degradation of EMT - TFs . For example , β - TrCP1 has been shown to mediate cytoplasmic degradation of Snail [ 14 , 36 ] . To be targeted by ubiquitin ligase machinery , a protein usually contains a degradation Figure 5 : Overexpression of Dub3 induces EMT . ( A ) Dub3 was stably transduced in MCF7 and T47D cells and the indicated proteins were examined by western blot analysis . ( B ) MCF7 and T47D cells with Dub3 overexpression were examined for morphologic changes as well as expression of E - cadherin , ER α and Dub3 with IF .

Oncotarget 75135 www . impactjournals . com / oncotarget signal or degron . As for Snail , the degron lies in the β - TrCP1 destruction box DSGXXS at the central region , with the two serine residues phosphorylated by GSK - 3β [ 14 ] . The lysine residues modified by β - TrCP1 have also been identified as K98 , K137 and K146 [ 37 ] . Interestingly , Slug and Twist are also subject to ubiquitination and degradation mediated by β - TrCP1 , although the classical destruction motif is absent [ 17 , 38 ] . In addition to β - TrCP1 , Fbxl14 is considered a common regulator of Snail / Slug , Twist and ZEB family members [ 37 , 39 , 40 ] . Slug and Twist interact with Fbxl14 through the C - terminal WR domain and an N - terminal hydrophobic sequence , respectively [ 39 , 40 ] . Furthermore , Fbxl5 exerts its E3 ligase function specifically on Snail and Slug [ 41 ] . In spite of these findings , little was known about how the reversal de - ubiquitination process might rescue these EMT - TFs from the fate of degradation during EMT and metastasis . Recently , we and others have identified Dub3 functions as a Snail deubiquitinase and blocks the activity of β - TrCP1 and Fbxl14 to stabilize Snail [ 29 , 42 ] ; however , it remains unclear whether Dub3 can also remove the ubiquitination of Slug and Twist , given that these EMT - TFs share a common ubiquitin E3 ligase β - TrCP1 and Fbxl14 . Our current results demonstrated that Dub3 interacts with Slug and Twist and prevents Slug and Twist from degradation mediated by these E3 ligases . The “Ying - Yang” control model proposed here greatly strengthens the concept of cellular plasticity and heterogeneity in EMT ( Figure 7C ) . It mirrors the prominent idea of “partial EMT” , which centers on cells hovering between epithelial and mesenchymal states as they migrate , therefore retaining greater flexibility to switch back through MET to fulfil Figure 6 : IL - 6 - induced BLBC cells invasion is mediated by Dub3 . ( A ) SUM159 cells were starved overnight and treated with IL - 6 for the indicated time intervals and the expression of Dub3 , Slug and Twist were examined by western blot analysis . ( B ) SUM159 cells stably transduced with either control or Dub3 shRNA were starved and treated with IL - 6 and the expression of Slug and Twist was examined . ( C ) SUM159 cells were pre - treated with DMSO , WP1130 or PR619 for half hour . The cells were then treated with IL - 6 ( 50ng / ml ) and the expression of Slug and Twist was examined by western blot analysis . ( D ) SUM159 cells stably transduced with control or Dub3 shRNA were pre - treated with DMSO or WP1130 for half hour . Boyden chamber invasion assay was performed with or without IL - 6 induction . Data were presented as mean ± SEM . Scale bar = 100 μm . * * p value < 0 . 01 ; * p value < 0 . 05 ; # p value > 0 . 05 . Oncotarget 75136 www . impactjournals . com / oncotarget metastatic colonization . In this regard , the balance between degradation and stabilization of EMT - TFs may oscillate under extremely dynamic cellular contexts , which warrants further investigation . Furthermore , we found that Dub3 is responsible for Slug and Twist stabilization and EMT induction in BLBC cells , and its expression positively correlates with Twist level in human breast tumor samples . In addition , Dub3 can be rapidly induced by inflammatory cytokine IL - 6 [ 22 , 23 ] . Elevated IL - 6 has been shown to confer cancer cells with chemotherapy resistance and contribute to tumor recurrence and metastasis [ 26 , 27 ] . As IL - 6 is highly expressed in BLBC cells as well as infiltrated tumor - associated macrophages ( TAMs ) [ 43 ] , it may exert its function of Dub3 activation through autocrine and paracrine loops . Interestingly , IL - 6 can stimulate casein kinase 2 ( CK2 ) - mediated phosphorylation and stabilization of Twist in head and neck cancer cells [ 44 ] . In the current study , we identified a novel connection between IL - 6 and Slug / Twist stabilization in BLBC cells specifically mediated by Dub3 . In this regard , Dub3 may represent an excellent example of a molecular sensor that relays environmental signals to intracellular EMT - TFs for the induction of EMT . Interestingly , tumor microenvironment produces cytokines , chemokines and growth factors , including TNFα , TGFβ , IL - 6 , FGF , epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) , and HGF . These factors initiate and propel tumor metastasis through induction of Figure 7 : Dub3 , Slug and Twist are coordinately expressed in breast tumors . ( A ) Expression of Dub3 , Slug and Twist was examined in multiple breast cancer cell lines . ( B ) Breast tumor surgical specimens were immunostained using antibodies against Dub3 and Twist . Representative images of IHC staining from the same tumor samples were shown in the top panel and statistical analysis shown in the bottom panel .

Oncotarget 75137 www . impactjournals . com / oncotarget EMT [ 45 ] . Here we have demonstrated that IL - 6 promotes metastasis through Dub3 induction . Dub3 can also be induced in response to IL - 4 stimulation [ 23 , 46 ] . Whether other cytokines and / or growth factors may also induce tumor invasion and metastasis via Dub3 is an important area that requires further investigations . Finally , the discovery of the role of Dub3 in controlling EMT - TFs brings out new therapeutic indications . Development of Slug and Twist - targeting inhibitors would encounter formidable obstacles due to their lack of ligand - binding domains . Our study propels alternative approaches , i . e . , design of specific Dub3 enzymatic inhibitors or Dub3 - Slug / Twist protein complex - disrupting molecules . Indeed , we found that application of WP1130 , a Dub3 inhibitor , not only significantly suppressed Slug and Twist upregulation induced by IL - 6 in BLBC cells , but also inhibited the IL - 6 - induced cell invasion . Our study highlights the perspectives of small molecule compounds that target the IL - 6 - Dub3 - Slug / Twist signaling axis with high specificity and efficiency in treatment of tumor metastasis .

Pre - cleared cell lysates were incubated overnight with 1 μg of anti - HA or anti - Flag antibody conjugated to agarose beads ( Roche Molecular Biochemicals ) at 4°C . The beads were then washed with PBS , and the immunoprecipitated protein complexes were resolved by 10 % SDS – PAGE . In vivo ubiquitination assay HEK293 cells were transfected with HA - ubiquitin , Myc - Dub3 and Flag - Twist or Flag - Slug plasmids as indicated . After 48 hours of transfection the cells were treated with 10 μM MG132 for 6 hours . The cells lysates were immunoprecipitated using anti - Flag agarose ( Sigma ) . Immunofluorescence staining For immunofluorescence microscopy , cells transfected with Myc - Dub3 and EGFP - Twist or EGFP - Slug were grown on cover slips , fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde and incubated overnight with anti - Myc antibody . Proteins were visualized by incubation with goat anti - mouse conjugated with Alexa Fluor 568 ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) . Finally , cells on cover slips were incubated with 4′ , 6′ - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( Sigma - Aldrich ) for 20 min and visualized with a confocal microscope . Quantitative real - time PCR Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy Mini kit ( Qiagen ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Specific quantitative real - time PCR experiments were performed using SYBR Green Power Master Mix following manufacturer’s protocol ( Applied Biosystems ) . Invasion assay Invasion assays were performed in Boyden chambers coated with Matrigel ( BD biosciences , San Jose , CA , USA ) . Cancer cells were seeded on top of the Matrigel in the upper chamber while the bottom chambers were filled with non - serum culture medium plus 100 nM Lysophosphatidic acid ( LPA ) . The invasive cancer cells were stained with crystal violent . All experiments were performed in triplicate . Oncotarget 75138 www . impactjournals . com / oncotarget Tumorsphere - formation assay Tumorsphere cultures were performed as described in Dontu et al [ 48 ] . In brief , Cell monolayers were plated as single - cell suspensions on ultra - low attachment plates ( Corning ) in DMEM / F12 medium supplemented with 20 ng / ml EGF , 10 μg / ml insulin , 0 . 5 μg / ml hydrocortisone and B27 . Tumorspheres were counted via visual inspection after 5 - 10 days . Immunohistochemical ( IHC ) staining Breast cancer TMA was purchased from US Biomax and Pantomics containing 160 cases of breast cancer . Tissue samples were stained with anti - Dub3 ( Abcam ) and anti - Twist antibodies ( BD company ) and each sample was scored by an H - score method that combines the values of immunoreaction intensity and the percentage of tumor cell staining as described previously [ 49 ] . In brief , a composite staining index is the product staining intensity ( range 0 - 3 ) and staining percentage of tumor cell sin each core . The results were ranked in three expression levels : high ( 3 + ) , Low ( 2 + ) , and negative ( 0 - 1 + ) . Chi - square analysis was used to analyze the relationship between Dub3 and Twist expression ; statistical significance was defined as P < 0 . 05 .
