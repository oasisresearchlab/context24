Zipf , Power - laws , and Pareto - a ranking tutorial Lada A . Adamic Information Dynamics Lab Information Dynamics Lab , HP Labs Palo Alto , CA 94304 A line appears on a log - log plot . One hears shouts of " Zipf ! " , " power - law ! " , " Pareto " ! Well , which one is it ? The answer is that it ' s quite possibly all three . Let ' s try to disentangle some of the confusion surrounding these matters and then tie it all back neatly together . All three terms are used to describe phenomena where large events are rare , but small ones quite common . For example , there are few large earthquakes but many small ones . There are a few mega - cities , but many small towns . There are few words , such as ' and ' and ' the ' that occur very frequently , but many which occur rarely . Zipf ' s law usually refers to the ' size ' y of an occurrence of an event relative to it ' s rank r . George Kingsley Zipf , a Harvard linguistics professor , sought to determine the ' size ' of the 3rd or 8th or 100th most common word . Size here denotes the frequency of use of the word in English text , and not the length of the word itself . Zipf ' s law states that the size of the r ' th largest occurrence of the event is inversely proportional to it ' s rank : y ~ r - b , with b close to unity . Pareto was interested in the distribution of income . Instead of asking what the r th largest income is , he asked how many people have an income greater than x . Pareto ' s law is given in terms of the cumulative distribution function ( CDF ) , i . e . the number of events larger than x is an inverse power of x : P [ X > x ] ~ x - k . It states that there are a few multi - billionaires , but most people make only a modest income . What is usually called a power law distribution tells us not how many people had an income greater than x , but the number of people whose income is exactly x . It is simply the probability distribution function ( PDF ) associated with the CDF given by Pareto ' s Law . This means that P [ X = x ] ~ x - ( k + 1 ) = x - a . That is the exponent of the power law distribution a = 1 + k ( where k is the Pareto distribution shape parameter ) . See Appendix 1 for discussion of Pareto and power - law . Although the literature surrounding both the Zipf and Pareto distributions is vast , there are very few direct connections made between Zipf and Pareto , and when they exist , it is by way of a vague reference [ 1 ] or an overly complicated mathematical analysis [ 2 , 3 ] . Here I show a simple and direct relationship between the two by walking through an example using real data . Recently , attention has turned to the internet which seems to display quite a number of power - law distributions : the number of visits to a site [ 4 ] , the number of pages within a site [ 5 ] , and the number of links to a page [ 6 ] , to name a few . My example will be the distribution of visits to web sites . Figure 1a below shows the distribution of AOL users ' visits to various sites on a December day in 1997 . One can observe that a few sites get upward of 2000 visitors , whereas most sites got only a few visits ( 70 , 000 sites received only a single visit ) . The distribution is so extreme that if the full range was shown on the axes , the curve would be a perfect L shape . Figure 1b below shows the same plot , but on a log - log scale the same distribution shows itself to be linear . This is the characteristic signature of a power - law . Abstract Many man made and naturally occurring phenomena , including city sizes , incomes , word frequencies , and earthquake magnitudes , are distributed according to a power - law distribution . A power - law implies that small occurrences are extremely common , whereas large instances are extremely rare . This regularity or ' law ' is sometimes also referred to as Zipf and sometimes Pareto . To add to the confusion , the laws alternately refer to ranked and unranked distributions . Here we show that all three terms , Zipf , power - law , and Pareto , can refer to the same thing , and how to easily move from the ranked to the unranked distributions and relate their exponents . Let y = number of sites that were visited by x users . In a power - law we have y = C x - a which means that log ( y ) = log ( C ) - a log ( x ) So a power - law with exponent a is seen as a straight line with slope - a on a log - log plot . Now one just might be tempted to fit the curve in Fig . 1b to a line to extract the exponent a . A word of caution is in order here . The tail end of the distribution in Fig . 1b is ' messy ' - there are only a few sites with a large number of visitors . For example , the most popular site , Yahoo . com , had 129 , 641 visitors , but the next most popular site had only 25 , 528 . Because there are so few data points in that range , simply fitting a straight line to the data in Fig . 1b gives a slope that is too shallow ( a = 1 . 17 ) . To get a proper fit , we need to bin the data into exponentially wider bins ( they will appear evenly spaced on a log scale ) as shown in Fig . 2a . A clean linear relationship now extends over 4 decades ( 1 - 10 4 ) users vs . the earlier 2 decades : ( 1 - 100 ) users . We are now able to extract the correct exponent a = 2 . 07 . Rather than binning logarithmically , one can instead look at the Pareto cumulative distribution P [ X > x ] ~ x - k to obtain a good fit . The tail naturally smooths out in the cumulative distribution and no data is ' obscured ' as in the logarithmic binning procedure . Fitting the cumulative distribution , we find an exponent of a = 2 . 16 , quite close to the a = 2 . 07 exponent found with the logarithmic binning procedure ( both fits are shown in Figure 2b ) . So far we have only looked at the power - law PDF of sites visits . In order to see Zipf ' s law , we need to plot the number of visitors to each site against its rank . Fig . 3 shows such a plot for the same data set of AOL users ' site visits . The relationship is nearly linear on a log - log plot , and the slope is - 1 , which makes it Zipf . In order for there to be perfectly linear relationship , the most popular sites would have to be slightly popular , and the less popular sites slightly more numerous . It might be Fig . 1a Linear scale plot of the distribution of users among web sites Fig . 1b Log - log scale plot of the distribution of users among web sites Fig . 2a Binned distribution of users to sites Fig . 2b Cumulative distribution of users to sites worthwhile to fit this distribution with alternate distributions , such as the stretched exponential [ 7 ] , or parabolic fractal [ 8 ] . In any case , most would happy to call this rank distribution Zipf , and we will call it Zipf here as well . At first , it appears that we have discovered two separate power laws , one produced by ranking the variables , the other by looking at the frequency distribution . Some papers even make the mistake of saying so [ 9 ] . But the key is to formulate the rank distribution in the proper way to see its direct relationship to the Pareto . The phrase " The r th largest city has n inhabitants " is equivalent to saying " r cities have n or more inhabitants " . This is exactly the definition of the Pareto distribution , except the x and y axes are flipped . Whereas for Zipf , r is on the x - axis and n is on the y - axis , for Pareto , r is on the y - axis and n is on the x - axis . Simply inverting the axes , we get that if the rank exponent is b , i . e . n ~ r - b in Zipf , ( n = income , r = rank of person with income n ) then the Pareto exponent is 1 / b so that r ~ n - 1 / b ( n = income , r = number of people whose income is n or higher ) ( See Appendix 2 for details ) . Of course , since the power - law distribution is a direct derivative of Pareto ' s Law , its exponent is given by ( 1 + 1 / b ) . This also implies that any process generating an exact Zipf rank distribution must have a strictly power - law probability density function . As demonstrated with the AOL data , in the case b = 1 , the power - law exponent a = 2 . Finally , instead of touting two separate power - laws , we have confirmed that they are different ways of looking at the same thing .

Appendix 1 : The Pareto Distribution The Pareto distribution gives the probability that a person ' s income is greater than or equal to x and is expressed as [ 10 ] : Pr [ X > = x ] = ( m / x ) k , m > 0 , k > 0 , x > = m , where m represents a minimum income . As a consequence , the CDF Pr [ X < x ] = 1 - ( m / x ) k and the PDF is p X ( x ) = k m k x - ( k + 1 ) , m > 0 , k > 0 , x > = m Note that the shape parameter of the Pareto distribution , k , equals a - 1 , where a is the power law slope . Also note that for a < 2 there is no finite mean for the distribution . Presumably because of this , the Pareto distribution is sometimes given with k > 1 , but the k > 0 definition is more widely used . Another property , which holds for all k , not just those k not giving a finite mean , is that the distribution is said to be " scale - free " , or lacking a " characteristic length scale " . This means that no matter what range of x one looks at , the proportion of small to large events is the same , i . e . , the slope of the curve on any section of the log - log plot is the same . Appendix 2 : From Zipf ' s ranked distribution to powerlaw PDFs Let the slope of the ranked plot be b . Then the expected value E [ X r ] of the r th ranked variable X r is given by E [ X r ] ~ C 1 * r - b , C 1 a normalization constant , which means that there are r variables with expected value greater than or equal to C 1 * r - b : P [ X > = C 1 * r - b ] = C 2 * r Changing variables we get : P [ X > = y ] ~ y - ( 1 / b ) To get the PDF from the CDF , we take the derivative with respect to y : Pr [ X = = y ] ~ y - ( 1 + ( 1 / b ) ) = y - a . Which gives the desired correspondence between the two exponents . a = 1 + ( 1 / b ) This tutorial exists only in an online version but some of the discussion is included in L . A . Adamic and B .
