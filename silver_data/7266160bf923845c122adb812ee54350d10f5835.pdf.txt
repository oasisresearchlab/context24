Without any quantitative information about the physical properties of colors , tones , speech sounds , or words , we can learn something about how humans pro - cess such stimuli from an analysis of rat - ings of perceived similarity , frequencies with which the stimuli are actually con - fused with each other , latencies of dis - criminative responses , or , in the case of infants and other animals , magnitudes of the " orienting reflex " when one stimulus is substituted for the other ( 1 , 2 ) . This physical dimensions are as yet poorly characterized , and it is essential in the case of symbolic stimuli such as words , for which the relevant semantic dimen - sions are not even present in the physical stimuli .

American mathematical psychologists have developed computer - based methods for constructing representations of the psychological structure of a set of stimuli on the basis of pairwise measures of similarity or confusability . Applications to perceptual and semantic data illustrate how complementary aspects of the underlying psychological structure are revealed by different types of representations , including multidimensional spatial configurations and nondimensional tree - structures or clus - terings . purely psychological approach has ad - vantages over a psychophysical one in the case of complex , naturalistic stimuli such as faces , for which the relevant The author is professor of psychology at Stanford University , Stanford , California 94305 .

However , little prog - 0036 - 8075 / 80 ( 1024 - 0390 $ 02 . 00 / 0 Copyright C 1980 AAAS ress was made toward the development of data - analytic methods for the con - struction of such spatial representations on the basis of psychological data until the efforts of a group of psychome - tricians , beginning in the late 1930 ' s at Chicago and subsequently moving to Princeton , culminated in the 1952 devel - opment by Torgerson of the first fully workable method of metric multidi - mensional scaling ( 7 , 8 ) . This method is called " metric " be - - cause it requires psychological estimates of metric distances between the stimuli . Either one had to assume that the data ( for example , subjective ratings of dis - similarity ) increased linearly with such distances ( 9 ) , or one had to use some preliminary ( for example , " Thursto - nian " ) scaling procedure to convert the data into numbers that could then be as - sumed to increase linearly with distance ( 8 ) . Even after such numbers had been obtained , the computation required sev - eral more stages in which one succes - sively ( i ) estimated the " additive con - stant " and thus obtained a matrix of esti - mated distances between the points ; and then , on the basis of a theorem of Young and Householder ( 10 ) , ( ii ) computed a matrix of scalar products between the points ( interpreted as vectors issuing from their common centroid ) , and ( iii ) factored this matrix into its eigenvalues and vectors to obtain explicit coordi - nates for the stimuli in a Euclidean space of a number of dimensions correspond - ing to the number of large eigenvalues . Meanwhile , I had been approaching the problem of analyzing such measures of similarity by estimating the nonlinear form of the monotonic function , fmon , Sij = fmon ( di3 ) ( 1 ) where sij is the obtained measure of simi - larity between stimuli i and ] and where du is a distance between corresponding points i and j that satisfies quite general metric conditions .

In addi - to its strong assumption of linearity , B Torgerson ' s original metric method was not readily extendable to other cases in which , for example , the underlying met - ric is non - Euclidean , or the matrix of data is incomplete . My own early meth - od of dealing with nonlinearities was cumbersome and did not handle error variability in an optimum way . And the method of Coombs and Hays was im - practical except for small matrices of data , and its nonmetric solutions failed to preserve what I subsequently found to be the essentially metric constraints of the ordinal data .

I used a one - stage iterative method ( i ) to adjust the positions of points in a space until the rank order of the interpoint distances was as nearly as possible the inverse of the rank order of the corresponding simi - larities , and ( ii ) to find the space of the smallest number of dimensions for which the residual departure from a perfect in - verse ranking was acceptably small ( 16 ) . Following a few adjustments , on 17 March 1961 the iterative process with which I had been expenmenting finally converged to its first stationary configu - ration ( at just 2 : 33 p . m . EST , according to the computer log ) . From then on , re - sults of surprising precision were regu - larly obtained . Provided that the number of points was not too small relative to the number of dimensions , the merely quali - tative , ordinal relations in the similarity data generally turned out to be sufficient to determine the quantitative , metric structure of the spatial representation . In two dimensions , a test configuration of as many as 15 random points could be essentially reconstructed on the basis merely of the rank order of the interpoint distances ( 16 ) ; and with as many as 45 random points , I later found that prod - uct - moment correlations between true and recovered distances averaged over 0 . 9999997 ( 17 ) . Such nonmetric multidimensional scaling soon reached essentially its pres - ent state of development when my asso - ciate J . B . Kruskal employed standard gradient methods to minimize an explic - itly defined sum - of - squares measure of departure from the monotonic relation that I had posited between similarity and distance ; namely , the " stress " measure ( S ) given by I ( dij - dj ) 2 11 / 2 s = ij ~ ~ ~ ~ J ( 4 ) Here , the dij are the distances between the points at any particular iteration giv - en , in terms of the N x K coordinates Xik of the N points in the K - dimensional Eu - clidean space , by the usual distance for - mula di ( Xik Xik ) jf k = 1 ( 5 ) and the d j are numbers that ( i ) are mono - tonic with the similarity data si , j and ( ii ) minimize stress relative to the spa - ma na 4l _ ~ ~ ~ m ka _ * ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ f pa ' a ta , ^ tha ta I . mw I va lo sa sAa sha ga w .

In some trial number of dimensions , a starting configuration of points is first constructed , either at random or by a metric method ( 19 ) . On each ensuing it - eration , then , ( i ) the best - fitting mono - tonic sequence du is determined anew by an algorithm for least - squares monotone regression ; ( ii ) the N x K partial deriva - tives of stress with respect to the coordi - nates , Xik , are evaluated ; and ( iii ) the coordinates are adjusted in the direction of the negative gradient or steepest de - scent by X ' ik = Xik - a * OSaXik , where a includes an adaptively modified step - size factor ( 18 ) . The process is termi - nated when the components of the gradi - ent have become small enough to in - dicate a close approach to a stationary configuration . ( In order to exclude en - trapment in a merely local minimum , dif - ferent starting configurations should be tried . ) The entire process can be repeat - ed in spaces of higher or lower dimen - sionality , with the final solution chosen to achieve the best balance between par - simony , goodness of fit and , especially , substantive interpretability ( 20 , 21 ) . Applications to Perception Figure lA displays the first significant set of empirical data to which I applied my original program for " analysis of proximities " ( 16 ) ; namely , Ekman ' s data on the perceived similarities between 14 spectral colors ( 22 ) . The stationary two - dimensional configuration to which the iterative process converged is shown in Fig . iB , together with a smooth curve subsequently drawn through the 14 points . Figure IC shows the nonlinear relation between Ekman ' s similarity data and Euclidean distances in the obtained configuration . In addition to its good fit to the data , the two - dimensional solution is both more similar to Newton ' s ( 3 ) col - or circle and more parsimonious than the five - dimensional representation that Ek - man ( 22 ) himself obtained by applying factor analysis to the data . Figure ID displays the frequencies with which unskilled listeners in an ex - periment by Rothkopf ( 23 ) judged suc - cessive aural signals of the international Morse code to be the same . Figure IE shows the two - dimensional solution that I obtained by applying Kruskal ' s im - proved program , MDSCAL , to these data , after averaging each entry s ; 0 with its symmetrical counterpart sMi ( 24 ) . The two - dimensional solution seems more in - formative than the original 36 x 36 ma - trix of data . As is indicated by the added lines , perceptions of these aural signals SCIENCE , VOL . 210 on S ep t e m be r 3 , 2012 www . sc i en c e m ag . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m differed primarily with respect to the number of components ( dots or dashes ) in each signal , and the relative pre - ponderance of dots versus dashes among those components . Information about the sequential structure within each sig - nal was largely lost on these unskilled lis - teners . Figure 2 presents the solution that I obtained from an analysis of data collect - ed by Miller and Nicely ( 25 ) on errors of identification of 16 consonant phonemes ( all followed by the vowel lal , " ah " ) in the presence of noise ( 26 , 27 ) . Centered over each of the 16 obtained points is a representative sound spectrogram for that syllable and , just below , its charac - teristic English spelling . The positions of the points are shown more precisely in Fig . 3A , by the phonetic symbols for the consonants . The added interpretive lines indicate how the speech sounds are orga - nized on the basis of such phonetic fea - tures as voicing , nasality , affrication , and place of articulation . As can be seen in Fig . 3B , the resulting fit was very close , accounting for about 98 percent of the variance of the data . As before ( 13 , 20 , 24 , 28 ) , I found the confusion data to be well approximated by a negative ex - ponential ( the fitted curve ) . Analysis of Multiple Matrices We could also analyze separately the matrix of data for each subject , amount of training , or condition of stimulus pre - sentation . But a more powerful analysis is achievable by simultaneously taking account of the entire set of matrices in each case . A metric method of individual difference scaling , INDSCAL , origi - nated by another of my associates , J . D . Carroll , has proved particularly effective for this purpose ( 29 ) . Carroll assumed that the same spatial configuration is ap - propriate for each individual subject or condition , but that the individuals differ with respect to the effective weights of the different dimensions . Accordingly , Carroll replaced the usual Euclidean dis - tance formula ( Eq . 5 ) by IK 1 / 2 dij ( m ) = E W . k ( Xik Xjk ) ' k = I ( 6 ) where Wik is the weight of dimension k for individual m , and dijim ' is the resulting effective distance between stimuli i and j for that individual . Carroll and Chang adapted nonlinear interative least squares to the canonical decomposition of the three - way N x N x M matrix of stimuli by stimuli by individuals to ob - tain a metric configuration of the N stim - uli in an orthogonal coordinate space and 24 OCTOBER 1980 also the unknown weights of the orthog - onal dimensions of this space for each of the M individual subjects or condi - tions ( 29 , 30 ) . The larger , three - way ma - trix of data can support the extraction of a larger number of dimensions than is usually possible in the analysis of two - way matrices . Moreover , because the re - sults are not , as in the Euclidean two - way case , arbitrary with respect to rota - tion , the unrotated axes of the solution should be immediately interpretable .

Over 90 percent of the total variance was accounted for by a two - dimensional so - lution in which the ten spectral hues formed a circular configuration very much like the one ( Fig . 1B ) that I had previously obtained . Now , however , the two orthogonal axes immediately corre - sponded to a red - green and to a blue - yel - low dimension , in agreement with cur - rently accepted " opponent - process " theories of color vision ( 33 ) .

Taking advantage of my demonstra - tion that the generally exponential rela - tion of confusion frequency to distance holds , in particular , for Miller and Nice - ly ' s data on confusions between con - sonants ( Fig . 3B ) , Arabie and Soli ( 34 , 35 ) logarithmically transformed Miller and Nicely ' s data into distance - like num - bers . They then applied Carroll and Chang ' s INDSCAL to the entire set of 17 resulting matrices - one matrix for each of the 17 different conditions of stimulus presentation ; namely , six ( Nl to N6 ) for increasingly added masking noise , six ( L2 to L7 ) for increasingly restrictive low - pass filtering , and five ( H2 to H6 ) for increasingly restrictive high - pass filter - ing . Panels C and D of Fig . 3 display the resulting four - dimensional solution , which accounts for 69 percent of the var - iance in the total set of 17 transformed matrices ( as opposed to 61 percent with - out the prior log transformation ) . Dimensions 1 and 2 are determined by low - frequency energy associated with voicing and nasality ( compare Fig . 3A ) or , in terms of acoustic events identi - fiable in the sound spectrograms ( 35 ) , as - sociated with the temporal relations be - tween initial noise burst and onset of pe - riodic pulsing ( dimension 1 ) and with transition in the lowest resonance or " first formant " ( dimension 2 ) . Dimen - sions 3 and 4 , by contrast , are deter - mined by higher frequency energy asso - ciated with transition in the middle reso - nance or second formant ( dimension 3 ) and extent of high - frequency " sh " noise characteristic of the sibilants If , . 3 / and to a lesser extent Is , zI ( dimension 4 ) . The weights of the 17 conditions , plotted in the planes of the same pairs of dimen - sions ( Fig . 3 , E and F ) corroborate this interpretation : The low - pass conditions are more heavily weighted on the first two dimensions , while the high - pass con - ditions are more heavily weighted on the last dimension ( 34 ) . Non - Eucidean Representations The Shepard - Kruskal approach to multidimensional scaling ( 16 , 18 ) made feasible , for the first time , the search for solutions in non - Euclidean spaces . In his improved program MDSCAL , for ex - ample , Kruskal ( 18 ) replaced the Eu - clidean distance formula with the more general Minkowski r - metric formula dij = { i IXik - xJkl ( 7 ) The family of r - metrics had been ofinter - est to students of perception because of indications that whereas perceived simi - larities conform to the locally Euclidean metric ( r = 2 ) for perceptually " uni - tary " stimuli such as homogeneous col - ors , perceived similarities tend to con ' form to something closer to the " city - block " metric ( r = 1 ) for " analyzable " stimuli such as geometrical shapes dif - fering in perceptually distinct dimensions of size , orientation , and brightness ( 8 , 36 ) . For Ekman ' s color data , Kruskal in fact obtained lowest values of stress when r was close to 2 ( 18 ) , while for more analyzable stimuli better fits tend to be obtained with r close to 1 ( 37 ) . ( An example of an r = 1 solution for the se - mantic domain will be given later in this article . ) Spaces that are non - Euclidean in the sense of being globally curved though lo - cally Euclidean also have been pro - posed - particularly for perceived colors ( 4 ) , positions of luminous points ( 38 ) , and orientations in three - dimensional space ( 39 ) . One step in the extension of multidimensional scaling to such situa - tions has been based on an assumption of constant curvature ( 40 ) . Another ap - proach has sought to simplify the prob - lem of interpreting globally curved struc - tures by mapping them down into a flat Euclidean space of the same " intrinsic dimensionality " ( 20 , 39 , 41 ) . Figure 4 shows results that Carroll , Chang , and I obtained in tests with artificial similarity data derived from distances between points on the surface of a sphere .

Both proce - dures yield a parametric representation in an appropriately reduced space , and the second tends to be conformal . Nondimensional Scaling In some applications our primary in - terest is in determining the functional form of the relation between similarity and distance ; for example , whether that form is exponential for confusion data ( 13 ) and hyperbolic for discrimination times ( 42 ) . Accordingly , Cunningham and I developed a method of nondimen - sional scaling , which used a gradient - projection method to find distances , dj , in a completely general , coordinate - free metric space , that are as nearly as pos - sible monotonically related to the given similarity data , su . In order to obtain so - lutions that achieved an acceptable fit but that were , at the same time , as far as possible from the trivial and degenerate one with all points equally distant from each other , which in multidimensional scaling is ruled out by minimizing the number of dimensions , we had to maxi - mize the variance of the distances . The only other condition on the distances ( a condition that we imposed by a " penalty function " ) was that they satisfy the three distance axioms ( Eqs . 2a , 2b , and 2c ) [ see ( 43 ) ] . We found that we could accurately re - cover the nonlinear shape of the function used to generate artificial similarity data even though the program was provided no information about either the type of metric or the form of the function . By contrast , an MDSCAL solution failed to recover the form of the function when the data were derived from very non - Eu - clidean sum - over - path distances in a tree . Figure 4C shows the results ob - tained when we applied this program to the Morse code data of Fig . ID . Without assuming anything about the nature of the underlying . metric , we recovered a function essentially like the one I origi - nally obtained on the assumption of a Euclidean metric ( 24 ) . And , again , the relation is in rough agreement with a simple negative exponential function ( the one - parameter fitted curve ) . This method is nondimensional rather than multidimensional , because it does not furnish coordinates for a visualizable configuration of the stimuli . However , maximization of the variance of the dis - 24 OCTOBER 1980 Fig . 5 .

( That is , Eq . 2c tends toward Eq . 3 . ) Hence , it is tempting to take the addi - tional step of representing the distances as additive paths through a visualizable tree or graph ( 44 ) . Fitting Additive Trees Procedures for fitting additives or path - length trees to similarity data were soon devised by Cunningham ( 45 ) , Car - roll and Chang ( 46 ) , and Sattath and Tversky ( 47 ) . An additive tree is a graph without any closed loops , in which the distance between any two nodes is given by the sum of the lengths of the links in the unique path between those nodes . The procedures for fitting such trees were based on the replacement of the tri - angle inequality by the stronger , four - point additivity condition dhi + d . k - max { ( dhj + dik ) , ( dhk + d if ( 8 ) The resulting tree has N external nodes for the N stimuli , and the lengths of all connecting links are then estimated to minimize a least - squares measure of de - parture from good fit . Basically these methods are metric in that they treat the data as linearly related to underlying path - length distances . However , such distance - like data , if not initially avail - able , could be obtained from similarity data by first applying Cunningham - Shep - ard maximum variance nondimensional scaling . Figure 5 shows the additive tree that Sattath and Tversky ( 47 ) obtained by ap - plying their program ADDTREE to Hen - ley ' s ( 48 ) judged semantic dissimilarities between 30 animal terms . I have ar - ranged the branches in Fig . 5 so that the terminal nodes approximate the posi - tions of the corresponding points in a multidimensional scaling solution for these same data . The major branches of the tree roughly correspond to apes , ro - dents , carnivores ( both canines and fe - lines ) , and large herbivores ( hoofed ani - mals and elephant ) . Perhaps trees or graphs are particularly well suited to the representation of semantic structures . Sattath and Tversky reported that the original dissimilarity data were more closely fitted by path - length distances in the tree ( stress = . 07 , r = . 91 ) than by distances in a two - dimensional Euclid - ean representation requiring about the same number of parameters ( stress = . 17 , r = . 86 ) . Hierarchical Clustering The designation of one internal node as the " highest " node in an additive tree confers on every other node a derivative height by virtue of its distance from the designated node . The tree thereby be - comes a hierarchical clustering . If all ter - minal nodes are equally distant from the highest node , the distance between ter - minal nodes is then given simply by the height of the highest node on the con - necting path . Hence the hierarchical tree metric is a special case of the additive tree metric . In fact , as was indepen - dently shown by several workers in 1 % 7 ( 49 - 51 ) , the hierarchipal tree metric is governed by the " ultrametric " in - equality di ' max ( dih , dhj ) ( 9 ) which requires that all " triangles " be isosceles . Both nonmetric methods ( 49 , 395 on S ep t e m be r 3 , 2012 www . sc i en c e m ag . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m 50 ) and least - squares metric methods ( 46 , 51 ) have been devised for fitting such hierarchical tree structures to simi - larity data . Figure 6A shows the hierarchical tree that I obtained by reanalyzing the aver - age of Miller and Nicely ' s confusion ma - trices for unfiltered consonants , using the " diameter " ( or " complete - link " ) variant of the nonmetric method of hier - archical clustering developed by my co - worker S . C . Johnson ( 26 , 50 ) . In Fig . 6B , I have embedded the clusters corre - sponding to cuts through this tree at rep - resentative levels as closed curves in the earlier spatial solution ( Fig . 3A ) .

However , each of the two types of representation brings out dif - ferent aspects of the underlying struc - ture . Only the continuous , spatial repre - sentation preserves the parallel order - ings of the voiceless and the voiced frica - tives / f , o , s , f / and iv , * * , z , 3 / with respect to place of articulation and , hence , rep - resents such facts as that the middle fricatives ( for example , / 6 / and Isl ) are more often confused than the extreme fricatives ( for example , If / and flf ) . But only the discrete , clustering representa - tion , separately obtained for each of Miller and Nicely ' s 17 conditions , re - veals that whereas the front voiceless stop / pI clusters with the other voiceless stops Ik , t / , the corresponding front voiced stop / bi uniformly groups with the front voiced fricatives lv , a / rather than with the other voiced stops / d , g / . Evi - dently , place of articulation was more salient than presence or absence of af - frication for voiced consonants , while for the voiceless consonants absence of af - frication became more salient owing to the correlated presence of an initial burst , which appears at the left in the spectrograms for / p , t , k / in Fig . 2 . In semantic studies , superordinate words might reasonably be represented by internal nodes n the tree . Carroll and Chang developed a combinatorial opti - mization procedure for least - squares fit - ting of such a hierarchical model ( 46 ) . Figure 7A snows the solution that they obtained from an analysis of semantic similarities that Miller had obtained for 20 names of body parts ( 46 ) . This repre - sentation accounted for 92 . 7 percent of the variance with only five continuous parameters ; namely , the height values for each of the five internal nodes of the tree . The semantic hierarchy seems to be well recovered , with " body " dominating " leg , " " arm , " " head , " and " trunk , " and with each of these dominating , in turn , the appropriate set of more subor - dinate terms . Additive Clustering Sometimes we would not want the psychologically significant subsets of the stimuli to be nested in a strictly hierarch - ical fashion . While the kin terms " fa - ther " and " mother " should be classified together in contrast to " son " and " daughter " on the basis of generation , the terms " mother " and " daughter " should be classified together in contrast to " father " and " son " on the basis of sex . But these two cross - cutting classifi - cations cannot be simultaneously accom - 24 OCTOBER 1980 modated within any one hierarchical rep - resentation . To deal with such cases , I developed with Arabie a nonhierarchi - cal method of additive clustering AD - CLUS , which differs from all of the more or less spatial representations in that it is not based on any notion of distance ( 20 , 52 , 53 ) . The basic idea behind additive cluster - ing is that the perceived similarity be - tween any two stimuli is simply the sum of positive psychological weights , Wk , of the discrete properties that both stimuli have in common . Formally , K Sjj = : WkPJikPJjk k - l ( lOa ) where fik 1 if object i has property k , P : k = to otherwise . ( lOb ) If it were not for the restriction that the Pik be binary valued , the model would be essentially identical to that of factor analysis , which Ekman ( 22 ) had assumed to be suitable for the representation of continuous structures in similarity data . However , the imposition of this binary restriction converts the problem of com - puting the eigenvalues and vectors of the similarity matrix into a more difficult combinatorial problem of finding the smallest set of weighted subsets that will provide a satisfactory additive fit to the data ( 52 ) . Figure 6C displays the subsets ob - tained when we applied ADCLUS to the Miller - Nicely data ( 25 ) on confusions be - tween 16 consonants , embedded in the previous two - dimensional scaling solu - tion ( see Figs . 3A and 6B ) . With these 16 subsets and the entire subset of all 16 consonants , the additive model was able to account for 94 . 5 percent of the vari - ance . The Arabic number in each subset indicates the rank of that subset accord - ing to its estimated weight ( ranging from . 730 to . 009 ) . The subsets in the additive clustering are not nested as they were in the hierarchical clustering ( Fig . 6B ) . For example , in accordance with the places of articulation , the sequence of voiceless fricatives / f , o , s , f / now forms a chain of overlapping clusters , as does the parallel sequence of voiced fricatives / v , f , z , . 3 / . And , for both the voiced and voiceless consonants , the front fricatives group with the front stops as well as with the relatively back fricatives . Finally , Fig . 7B shows the ADCLUS solution that Arabie and I obtained ( 52 ) from a reanalysis of Miller ' s data on the relations among 20 names of body parts . Here , the ten obtained clusters are em - bedded in a two - dimensional projection of the three - dimensional city - block solu - tion that Arabie obtained for these same data using MDSCAL . ( For these data , the residual stress was . 019 for r = 1 , as opposed to . 046 for the Euclidean r = 2 . ) An advantage to be expected for such a non - Euclidean solution is that the or - thogonal axes I , II , and III correspond , without rotation , to the immediately in - terpretable " leg , " " arm , " and " head " clusters . As before , the Arabic number within each subset indicates its rank with respect to weight ( ranging from . 820 to . 119 ) . When the entire set is included ( with a weight of . 048 ) , 95 . 6 percent of the variance is accounted for by these subsets . In comparison with the hier - archical representation obtained by Car - roll and Chang ( Fig . 7A ) , the ADCLUS representation fails to represent the su - perordinate status of some of the terms explicity . It does , however , provide an explicit representation of the nonhierar - chical overlap of certain of the subsets . Most significant among the overlapping subsets are subset 10 , which connects the functionally analogous " elbow " and " knee " parts of the " arm " and " leg " subsets , and subset 5 , which , in the words of the Negro spiritual , confirms that , indeed , " the head bone is con - nected to the neck bone . " Concluding Remark It would be a mistake to ask which of these various scaling , tree - fitting , or clustering methods is based on the cor - rect model . As even my small sample of illustrative applications indicates , dif - ferent models may be more appropriate for different sets of stimuli or types of data . Even for the same set of data , moreover , different methods of analysis may be better suited to bringing out dif - ferent , but equally informative aspects of the underlying structure ( 54 ) .

The paradoxical possibility of recovering quan - titative structure from merely qualitative data is connected with the circumstance that the num - ber of pairs of points and hence the number of ordinal constraints on their distances increases approximately as the square of the number ofto - be - estimated quantitative coordinates of the points . Methods taking advantage of this cir - cumstance are called " nonmetric " because they use only ordinal properties of the input . How - ever , the output can achieve great metric preci - sion and is always metric in the sense that it sat - isfies the distance axioms . 18 . J . B .

This paper includes a discussion of the common errors ( i ) of reporting a solution with too many dimensions , which gives a good fit but an unin - terpretable , probably unreliable , and sometimes " degenerate " solution ; and ( ii ) of failing to en - sure that entrapment in a merely local minimum has not occurred , particularly in the case ofone - dimensional solutions . 21 . A variety of computer programs of this general type have subsequently been developed . How - ever , if precautions are taken to exclude merely local minima , the generally high degree of over - determination of the final configuration by the ordinal constraints in the data ensures that all such methods are capable of yielding essentially the same results - including , indeed , metric methods , if nonlinearity is not too extreme [ see ( 20 ) ; D . G . Weeks and P . M . Bentler , Psychol . Bull . 86 , 349 ( 1979 ) ] . See ( 1 , 19 , 20 , 54 ) for cita - tions of some of the programs developed by Guttman , Lingoes , McGee , Roskam , Torger - son , Young , as well as by Kruskal and Shepard , Perhaps the currently most versatile such pro - gram is the one , available from the Bell Tele - phone Laboratories , named KYST ( after Krus - kal , Young , Shepard , and Torgerson , from whose earlier programs it derives ) . KYST pro - vides , also , for a very general analysis of rec - tangular matrices in which , in accordance with the " ideal - points " model of Coombs ( 15 ) , rows correspond to subjects , columns correspond to stimuli , and each entry is some measure of the preference of that subject for that stimulus and is interpreted as the spatial proximity between that stimulus and that subject ' s " ideal " stimulus ( 1 ) . The same kind of analysis , when applied to a square matrix of similarity data , can account for systematic asymmetries in the data . Other re - cent developments include ( i ) alternative ap - proaches to the problem of asymmetry [ for ex - ample , C . L . Krumhansl , Psychol . Rev . 85 , 445 ( 1978 ) ] , ( ii ) methods for imposing prespecified constraints on the spatial solution [ for example , P . M . Bentler and D . G . Weeks , J . Math .
