Here we present the 2 . 0 Å crystal structure of Arabidopsis thaliana ADF1 ( AtADF1 ) , the ﬁrst plant crystal structure from the ADF / coﬁlin ( AC ) family . Superposition of the four AC isoform struc - tures permits an accurate sequence alignment that differs from previously reported data for the loca - tion of vertebrate - speciﬁc inserts and reveals a contiguous , vertebrate - speciﬁc surface opposite the putative actin - binding surface . Extending the struc - ture - based sequence alignment to include 30 addi - tional isoforms indicates three major groups : verte - brates , plants , and “other eukaryotes . ” Within these groups , several structurally conserved residues that are not conserved throughout the entire AC family have been identiﬁed . Residues that are highly con - served among all isoforms tend to cluster around the tryptophan at position 90 and a structurally conserved kink in a - helix 3 . Analysis of surface character shows the presence of a hydrophobic patch and a highly conserved acidic cluster , both of which include several residues previously impli - cated in actin binding .

Key words : actin - depolymerizing factor ; crystal structure ; cytoskeleton ; isoform ; pro - teomics INTRODUCTION Orchestrated networks of actin ﬁlaments and associated proteins comprise the eukaryotic microﬁlament ( MF ) sys - tem , an organization essential for many basic cellular processes . As exempliﬁed by the dynamic nature of mem - brane rufﬂing , 1 exocytosis , 2 and cytokinesis , 3 an impor - tant characteristic of the MF system is its ability to be rapidly remodeled according to intra - and extracellular cues . Actin - depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) and coﬁlin deﬁne a family of small , monomeric proteins that bind to mono - meric ( G ) and ﬁlamentous ( F ) actin and increase the rate of ﬁlament polymerization and depolymerization . 4 , 5 This ac - tivity has been shown in vitro , for example , using the intracellular bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes , where depletion of ADF / coﬁlin ( AC ) slows bacterial motil - ity and lengthens the F - actin comet tails . 6 , 7 In studies of coﬁlin mutants in Saccharomyces cerevisiae , wild - type AC activity is necessary for rapid depolymerization of yeast actin cortical patches , suggesting that AC family members are the primary agents responsible for the rapidity of actin turnover in vivo . 8 Disruption of AC isoforms in S . cerevi - siae , 9 , 10 Caenorhabditis elegans , 11 and Drosophila melano - gaster 12 is lethal , highlighting the critical role of AC proteins in maintaining the plasticity of the MF system . ADF , coﬁlin , depactin , and actophorin were ﬁrst identi - ﬁed in chick , 13 pig , 14 starﬁsh , 15 and amoeba 16 as actin - binding proteins that rapidly depolymerize ﬁlamentous actin in vitro and were eventually shown to increase the rate of F - actin polymerization as well . The apparent paradox of stimulating both actin polymerization and depolymerization has been explained as a severing activ - ity . Since the AC proteins do not cap actin ﬁlament ends as in the case of gelsolin proteins , the creation of more plus ( barbed ) and minus ( pointed ) ends of F - actin via severing would presumably allow for faster F - actin turnover . 14 , 17 , 18 Carlier and coworkers , 7 , 19 however , have instead proposed that the mechanism of AC action involves acceleration of the treadmilling cycle by increasing the rate of pointed - end dissociation . Although a combination of severing and increased treadmilling has also been suggested , 20 – 22 sev - eral recent reports ﬁnd that a severing mechanism is sufﬁcient to account for AC activity . 23 – 25 The AC family is regulated by phosphorylation , phospho - inositide binding , pH , the state of the actin - bound nucleo - tide , and nuclear translocation .

N - terminal serine . 28 , 29 Like the other AC crystal struc - tures , 30 , 31 the structure of N - terminally phosphorylated actophorin from Acanthamoeba castellanii does not reveal the positioning for the phosphorylated serine residue due to disorder . 32 The absence of a stable intramolecular interaction involving the phosphoserine suggests that phosphorylation blocks AC activity by directly altering the character of the actin - binding surface . In contrast , phos - phoinositides have been shown to block the AC : actin interaction through competition . A coﬁlin - derived dodeca - mer peptide that binds weakly but speciﬁcally to phospho - inositides contains two actin - interacting basic residues on the loop preceding a - helix 3 , suggesting that phospho - inositides and actin recognize overlapping sites . 33 The activity of several AC isoforms is also sensitive to pH , with elevated pH levels resulting in increased depolymeriza - tion . 34 , 35 Signaling events , such as integrin binding 36 , 37 and growth factor stimulation , 38 , 39 result in a local in - crease in pH and mobilization of the actin cytoskeleton , suggesting a possible in vivo regulatory role for this pH - dependent depolymerization activity . 4 The state of the actin - bound nucleotide is also a determining factor in AC binding and activity as seen from the increased afﬁnity for ADP - actin compared with ATP - actin . 7 , 23 , 40 , 41 Another man - ner in which cells might regulate AC activity includes nuclear translocation upon various cellular stresses . 42 The presence of a putative nuclear localization signal ( NLS ) sequence in vertebrate AC proteins is believed to be responsible for the formation of nuclear coﬁlin : actin “rods” 42 , however it remains to be determined if this sequence is necessary for the translocation . Although the atomic details of the AC : actin interaction are not known , mutagenesis , high - resolution structure determination , and cryoelectron microscopy have provided insight into the AC : actin complex . Extensive mutagenesis data have accumulated from work with porcine , 21 , 43 yeast , 44 maize , 45 and C . elegans 46 isoforms regarding residues that do and do not disrupt actin binding to varying degrees . Placement of actin - interacting residues into a structural context has been possible with the structure determinations of human destrin ( also known as ADF1 ) , 47 S . cerevisiae coﬁlin , 30 and Acanthamoeba acto - phorin . 31 , 32 The AC - fold is built from a central , mixed b - sheet ﬂanked by two a - helices on each face . The putative actin - binding site includes the N - terminus and residues located on and preceding helices 3 and 4 , which primarily map to the edge and part of one face of the disk - shaped molecule ( for review see Lappalainen et al 48 and Bamburg et al 49 ) . Cryoelectron microscopic studies of the AC : actin interaction have offered a more global and functionally revealing view . McGough and coworkers have shown AC binding to ﬁlamentous actin induces a 5° twist , suggesting a structural mechanism for AC - induced depolymerization . 49 , 50 Here we report the crystal structure of Arabidopsis thaliana actin - depolymerizing factor 1 ( AtADF1 ) , the ﬁrst AC structure from the plant kingdom . By using available sequence and structural data , an overall comparative analysis of the AC family was performed . Notably , two major insertions and a C - terminal extension of the verte - brate isoforms form an extensive and contiguous surface not present in other family members . Many highly con - served amino acid positions cluster together in the struc - ture and form networks of interactions that are main - tained throughout these AC isoform structures . In addition , a comparative analysis underscores regions on the surface of the AC isoforms that are conserved in character and shows that the putative actin - binding face has remained more conserved than other regions of the surface . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Structural Overview The crystal structure of AtADF1 was solved to 2 . 0 Å resolution ( Table I ) . The C - terminal 15 residues were disordered due to the presence of a bound detergent molecule and crystal contacts . Displaying an average sequence identity of 41 % , AtADF1 superimposes well with the other nonvertebrate isoform structures ( yeast coﬁlin and Acanthamoeba actophorin ) with an average r . m . s . deviation of 1 . 05 Å for all C a atoms excluding a - helix 4 ( Fig . 1 ) . Vertebrates have the same global fold yet diverge from other members of the AC family by one minor and two major insertions and a carboxyl - terminal extension . C a superposition of the three nonvertebrate structures onto human destrin , excluding vertebrate - speciﬁc inserts , yields an average r . m . s . deviation of 2 . 27 Å . TABLE I .

STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS OF THE ADF / COFILIN FAMILY 375 Sequence Comparison of the AC Family Superposition of all ADF / coﬁlin structures allows for a precise amino acid sequence alignment , including place - ment of regions with less homology or insertions / deletions relative to the other three sequences . With these struc - tural representatives of the AC family , most of the other 30 AC family members can be readily aligned , with verte - brates , plants , and “other eukaryotes” displaying average sequence identities of approximately 74 % , 64 % , and 43 % , respectively ( Fig . 2A , B ; the sequence numbering used in the alignment and throughout the text is that of AtADF1 unless otherwise speciﬁed ) . Two relatively divergent iso - forms include C . elegans unc60A and Asterias amurensis ( starﬁsh ) depactin . The C . elegans isoform cannot be reliably aligned between amino acid positions 44 and 53 because of 14 additional residues compared with other nonvertebrates ( ﬁve additional residues compared with vertebrates ) and relatively low - sequence homology ( 32 % average identity with all family members ) . The isoform from A . amurensis , depactin , although being more similar in length to most family members , also displays relatively low sequence homology overall ( 29 % average identity ) , indicating that alignment of this sequence may misrepre - sent various structural elements . Several recent reviews highlight various similarities and differences of the AC family . 48 , 49 We disagree with several conclusions reached in these reviews that stem from the alignment of the vertebrate - speciﬁc inserts . The structure - based sequence alignment presented here posi - tions the ﬁrst vertebrate speciﬁc insert of nine residues between nonvertebrate amino acid positions 25 and 26 , the second major insert of seven residues between positions 51 and 52 , and a two residue insert between positions 44 and 45 . The misplacement of the second major insert and exclusion of the two amino acid insert in other published sequence alignments appear to have arisen from the coincidental matching of the yeast coﬁlin sequence ( 38 - EIVVKETS ) to the human destrin sequence ( 54 - EILVG - DVG ) instead of the structurally aligned vertebrate se - quence ( 46 - CIIVE [ EG ] KEI ) that includes the two amino acid insert ( bracketed residues ) . In addition , this misplace - ment also led to the conclusion that position 45 in yeast ( AtADF1 position 47 ) is a conserved residue in all AC family members occupied by either a serine or a glycine . 48 Although this position is in fact conserved as glycine or a small amino acid in nonvertebrates , vertebrates have the bulkier isoleucine at this position . Sequence alignments have proven to be a powerful tool for grouping proteins related in structure and function ; however , it is evident that the sequence alignment programs have their limita - tions and should be used with caution to resolve ambigu - ities ( e . g . , proper placement of gaps and inserts ) . With the increasing efforts toward structural genomics , the availabil - ity of structural representatives from divergent isoform sequences will allow for more accurate alignments and , therefore , more meaningful representations of unknown structures . Vertebrate - Speciﬁc Inserts The most striking aspects of the superposition of the four AC structures are two vertebrate - speciﬁc inserts found between a - helix 1 : b - strand 2 and b - strand 3 : a - helix 2 . These two inserts are spatially proximal to a vertebrate - speciﬁc C - terminal extension that together deﬁne a contigu - ous “horseshoe - shaped” surface around the loop between b - strands 4 and 5 , contributing approximately 1 , 530 Å 2 or Fig . 1 . C a superposition of AtADF1 ( green ) , S . cerevisiae coﬁlin 30 ( red ) , Acan - thamoeba actophorin 31 ( blue ) , and human destrin 47 ( gold ) . The ﬁnal a - helix of AtADF1 is not visible in the crystal structure due to a bounddetergent moleculeandcrystalpacking ( see Materials and Methods ) . 376 G . D . BOWMAN ET AL . 22 % of the total solvent accessible surface area of the protein ( Fig . 3 ) . Surrounded by and interacting with these inserts , this central loop appears to be more structurally stable than in nonvertebrates : the average r . m . s . devia - tions for this region of the human destrin NMR ensemble indicate good agreement ( , 1 . 0 Å ) among the top 20 solutions , 47 whereas the B - factors for these residues are relatively high in the nonvertebrate crystal structures . This vertebrate - speciﬁc surface is distinct from the actin - binding surface as evidenced by the spatial separation of actin - interacting residues identiﬁed by mutagenesis and from the ability of vertebrate isoforms to rescue a yeast coﬁlin knockout . 10 In an evolutionary sense , it is not surprising that the additional inserts were restricted to these regions given the pressure to maintain the actin binding surface . The ﬁrst vertebrate insert contains a putative NLS that is believed to be responsible for the nuclear translocation of AC upon cellular stresses . 51 , 52 In the crystal structure of the nuclear import factor karyopherin a complexed to the SV40 T antigen NLS , the extensive hydrophobic and charged interactions maintain the signal peptide in an extended conformation . 53 In human destrin , the putative NLS sequence is located at the C - terminal end of a short helix , which would require that this region undergo a conformational change before binding to a nuclear trans - port factor . Among the 20 solution structures , it was noted that the residues immediately preceding the NLS dis - played the highest r . m . s . deviations , indicating this to be an inherently mobile loop . 47 This region may , therefore , function as a molecular switch to dictate the cellular localization of vertebrate AC proteins : in the absence of cellular stresses , occlusion of this region allows the protein to maintain a cytoplasmic localization , whereas on heat shock , DMSO , and other stresses , exposure of the NLS allows the association of a nuclear transport factor and subsequent shuttling to the nucleus . 47 The contiguous surface presented by the second major insert and C - terminal extension may be important for binding / recogni - tion of a vertebrate - speciﬁc factor and subsequent confor - mational changes surrounding the NLS . Structural Comparison of the AC Family A closer inspection of the sequence alignment indicates that particular amino acid positions are conserved within the vertebrate , plant , and “other eukaryotes” groups , yet are nonconserved between these groups . Most of these amino acid positions cluster spatially and appear to serve structural roles similar to their isoform counterparts . In vertebrates , positions 29 and 47 ( destrin 35 and 55 ) are strictly conserved as alanine and isoleucine , respectively , whereas most nonvertebrates have an aromatic residue at position 29 and glycine or small amino acid at position 47 . In all isoform structures , residues 29 and 47 are in close van der Waals contact with each other and appear to be important for the positioning of the beginning and ending of b - strands 2 and 3 , respectively . Also , the aromatic residue at position 72 in nonvertebrates ﬁlls a space occupied by vertebrate Ala72 ( destrin Ala87 ) and a bulky side chain ( destrin position 161 ) on the vertebrate - speciﬁc C - terminal extension . Within the vertebrate class , it is notable that the identity of this C - terminal residue ( destrin 161 ) as phenyl - alanine or leucine correlates with that of position 53 ( destrin 68 ) as phenylalanine or tyrosine , respectively ( see Fig . 2 ) . Packing against one another , these two residues appear to stabilize the C - terminus : residue 53 stacks against aromatics at positions 56 and 70 and , as a tyrosine , can hydrogen bond to the backbone carbonyl of residue 127 , whereas destrin 161 packs against the aromatics at position 53 and 74 and hydrophobic side chains at posi - tions 134 and 135 . The favorable aromatic : aromatic inter - actions resulting from a phenylalanine at vertebrate posi - tion 161 may serve as an energetic trade - off for the hydrogen - bonding potential of a tyrosine at position 53 . For the 34 AC family members represented in the sequence alignment , 80 % sequence identity or greater is observed for 28 amino acid positions . Many of these residues perform structurally conserved roles that appear necessary , directly or indirectly , for maintenance of actin - binding surfaces . Trp90 is a highly conserved residue that interacts with loops containing putative actin - binding residues : the indole ring both participates in a hydrogen bond to the backbone carbonyl of residue 61 and makes van der Waals contacts with Leu60 , Pro61 , Pro92 , and the proline / aromatic at position 126 ( Fig . 4A ) . Another highly conserved motif of the AC family is the “kink” or disruption of a - helical hydrogen bonding in the middle of a - helix 3 ( Fig . 4B ) . Due to the f / c angles for residue 106 , the backbone carbonyl and amide groups of 104 : 108 and 105 : 109 are . 5 Å apart . Notably , in the structures of AtADF1 and the phosphorylated form of actophorin , the backbone carbonyls of residues 104 and 105 and the amide of residue 109 participate in hydrogen bonds to two well - ordered water molecules . Given the conserved backbone positioning of this region , the pres - ence of bound water molecules at these positions may be a general feature across the AC family . In all four struc - tures , stabilization of this region appears to be due in part to two highly conserved tyrosines at positions 67 and 103 . Pointed in opposition , these two tyrosines stack against one another , each hydrogen bonding to the backbone of or near the other . Removal of either hydroxyl group via mutagenesis to phenylalanine decreases the afﬁnity for actin , suggesting that this region is relatively sensitive to perturbation . 21 , 45 As seen from the sequence alignment in Figure 2 , the kink in a - helix 3 is surrounded by the most conserved regions of the protein . In particular , positions 104 – 106 strictly present small side chains , with alanine preferred at position 104 and serine or threonine at positions 105 and 106 . The substitution of larger side chains at these positions or elimination of the Ser106 hydroxyl group signiﬁcantly weakens actin binding , 21 , 46 suggesting that this region may directly contact actin . It has been proposed that maintenance of the a - helix 3 kink relies primarily on one 21 or both 30 of the serines at positions 105 and 106 ; however , these residues do not appear to be performing a STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS OF THE ADF / COFILIN FAMILY 377 Fig . 2 . A : Sequence alignment of the AC family . Superposition of AtADF1 , S . cerevisiaecoﬁlin , 30 Acanthamoebaactophorin , 31 and human destrin 47 provided a structure - based alignment . The secondary structure designations ( a - helix 5 cylinder , b - strand 5 arrow ) were calculated by using STRIDE . 63 All other sequences were aligned by using AMPS 64 and ALSCRIPT 65 with modiﬁcations based on structural superposition . Below the four structural representatives at the top of the alignment , the remaining 30 AC isoforms are grouped as vertebrates , plants , and “other eukaryotes . ” Residue numbering at the top of the alignment is that of AtADF1 and is used throughout the text , whereas the numbering above human ADF2 is that of the vertebrate group .

B : A phylogenetic tree of AC members based on the structure - based se - quence alignment . This organization shows the clustering of plant ( top ) and vertebrate ( bottom ) sequences , with signiﬁcantly lower homologies among the more diverse group of “other eukaryotes” ( middle ) . As previously noted , the mammalian and chicken isoforms appear to fall into three categories : muscle coﬁlin , nonmuscle coﬁlin , and ADF / destrins . 48 For plants , there is not adequate sequence data to reliably characterize the ADF isoforms into subclasses , yet trends are evident . In Arabidopsis thaliana , there is 84 % sequence identity among isoforms 1 – 4 , 72 % between 7 and 8 , and 77 % between 5 and 9 . AtADF 7 and 8 are more similar to B . napus ( rapeseed ) and L . longiﬂorum ( lily ) ADF , respectively , than to each other , hinting at divisions similar to those seen in the vertebrate class . The bar represents 10 % divergence .

Although Ser105 and Ser106 are within hydrogen - bonding distance to backbone carbonyls of resi - dues 101 and 102 , respectively , the hydroxyl of Ser105 displays high B - factors in yeast coﬁlin and AtADF1 , and neither of these serine hydroxyl groups is well ordered among the top 20 NMR solution structures of human destrin . Furthermore , as these serines and backbone car - bonyls are all preceding the kink of helix 3 , it is not clear how these hydrogen bonds would stabilize the opening of the helix between residues 104 : 108 and 105 : 109 . Conservation of Surface Character Since the four structural representatives of the AC family have been shown to functionally interact with rabbit skeletal muscle actin in vitro , one would expect the actin - interacting regions to display some degree of similar - ity in surface qualities . The surface topologies of three isoform crystal structures ( yeast coﬁlin , nonphosphory - lated actophorin , and AtADF1 ) were compared by ﬁrst superimposing the secondary structural elements and then calculating distances from the surface of one isoform to the surfaces of the other two ( see Materials and Meth - ods ) . On the basis of these distance calculations , it is possible to render only those surface vertices of one isoform that are within a given distance of the other two surfaces , thus visualizing those contours that are the most topologically similar . Performing this type of “surface subtraction” for the three crystal structures results in a weblike surface pattern for each isoform : the more substan - tial surface “patches” primarily stem from surface - exposed main - chain atoms , whereas “holes” in the surface are the result of side chains that differ in identity or rotomer conformation . Although most topologically conserved sur - face patches are located on turns and the edge strands of Figure 2 . ( Continued ) STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS OF THE ADF / COFILIN FAMILY 379 the b - sheet , a main - chain - exposed region that lies in the middle of the putative actin - binding surface is the kink in helix 3 ( Fig . 5 ) . In addition to the exposed main - chain atoms , the topology of this region is relatively limited because of the short alanine , serine and threonine side chains at positions 104 – 106 . These conserved features of the AC family may be critical for binding and / or depolymer - ization of actin ﬁlaments . For all four isoform structures , comparisons were also made for the hydrophobic and charged surface character . The surface - exposed hydrophobic residues at position 101 and 102 were previously noted for their proximity to the two conserved actin - binding residues at positions 98 and 100 and for a possible role in protein : protein interac - tions . 44 We ﬁnd that these residues are part of a larger , conserved hydrophobic patch , formed by Pro / Lys / Arg96 , Val / Leu / Ile97 , Arg / Lys98 , Lys100 , Met101 , and Ile / Leu / Met / Val102 , which covers 295 6 35 Å 2 of solvent - exposed surface ( Fig . 5 ) . At position 96 , it is interesting to note that the long aliphatic side chain of lysine or arginine found in plants maintains the hydrophobic character fulﬁlled by proline in nonplant isoforms . For electrostatic surface potential , the structural rep - resentatives of the AC family exhibit one conserved and three semiconserved regions . The most electrostatically conserved region among all four structures includes a cluster of three acidic residues ( 93 , 125 , and 128 ) and a lysine at position 100 , three of which ( positions 100 , 125 , and 128 ) have been implicated in actin binding via mutagenesis ( Fig . 5 ) . Although position 125 is not negatively charged in vertebrates , the acidic character of this region is instead contributed by the side - chain carboxyl group of position 127 ( destrin Asp / Glu141 ) . The three electrostatically semiconserved regions occur at the beginning of a - helix 3 ( Lys / Arg98 ) , on the second half of a - helix 3 and b - strand 6 ( Lys107 , Asp108 , Lys / Arg111 , Lys / Arg112 and Glu / Asp120 ) , and on a - he - lix 4 ( position 136 , primarily Glu / Asp and Lys / Arg137 ) . Although these regions display strong sequence conser - vation , most side chains differ in conformation among the isoforms , resulting in locally distinct surface topolo - gies and electrostatic distributions . Residues implicated in actin binding ( for review see Lappalainen et al 48 and Bamburg et al 49 ) are generally in or proximal to highly conserved regions of the protein surface , most notably the acidic patch following b - strand 6 , the hydrophobic patch at the base of a - helix 3 , and the kink in the middle of a - helix 3 ( Fig . 5 ) . However , there are several instances where mutagenesis does not affect actin binding as one might expect based on the sequence conser - vation . Mutations of highly conserved residues that did not appear to affect actin binding include Lys107 , Asp108 , Lys / Arg111 , and Lys / Arg112 . 44 It is possible that these residues play a role in the electrostatic “steering” that has been suggested to underlie the salt - induced disruption of the AC - dependent increase in barbed - end polymeriza - tion . 7 , 54 Further biochemical characterization of these mutants will be required to fully understand the strong sequence conservation observed at these positions . pH Regulation of AC Activity As evidenced by the importance of the state of the actin - bound nucleotide , the ability of AC proteins to bind and alter actin biochemistry depends very much on physi - cal changes in actin . The pH - dependent depolymerization shown for several AC isoforms 34 , 35 may be based on pH - induced structural changes in the actin ﬁlament rather than a direct effect on AC proteins themselves . Cryoelec - tron microscopy has recently shown that changes in pH notably alter the structure of ﬁlamentous actin , suggest - ing that distinct subsets of actin : actin contacts are favored at different pH values . 55 AC proteins have been shown to induce a twist in the actin ﬁlament , hypothesized to increase depolymerization by weakening actin : actin con - tacts . 49 , 50 The subsets of actin : actin ﬁlament contacts present at high pH may be more strained by the AC - induced ﬁlament twist than ﬁlament contacts at low pH . It may be a general feature of actin - binding proteins to take advantage of environmentally induced changes in the monomeric and ﬁlamentous actin structures . Crystal struc - ture determination of the AC : actin complex will be impor - tant in furthering our understanding of this dynamic actin regulator . Fig . 3 .

AtADF1 was extracted from cell pellets by using the freeze - thaw tech - nique . 56 After resuspension in 10 mM of Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 2 , 50 mM of NaCl , 0 . 1 mM of PMSF and 5 mM of DTT ( DEAE buffer ) , slurry was clariﬁed by centrifugation at 3K RPM for 20 min , 39K RPM for 1h , and then applied to a DEAE - Fast Flow column ( Pharmacia ) equilibrated in DEAE buffer . Flow - through fractions containing AtADF1 were then applied to an SP - Fast Flow column ( Pharmacia ) equilibrated in 10 mM of PIPES , pH 6 . 2 , 25 mM of NaCl , 5 mM of DTT , and eluted with a NaCl gradient ( 75 – 425mM ) . Fractions containing pure AtADF1 were dialyzed against 10 mM of KPO 4 , pH 7 . 6 , 1 mM of DTT , and concentrated to 18 – 25mg / mL for crystallization . Crystallization and Data Collection Crystals grew in hanging drops at 4°C , over a well solution of 1 . 6 M ( NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 , 100 mM of citrate , pH 5 . 8 , in drops of 5 m L of well solution , 4 m L of protein , and 1 m L of 20mM LDAO ( CalBiochem ) . Crystals appeared after 3 – 4 days and reached approximately 1 . 0 mm 3 0 . 5 mm 3 0 . 15 mm after 21 days . Diffraction data were collected on a single crystal at 100K using a Rigaku RU - H2R rotating copper anode and an RAXIS II - C detector , and processed with DENZO and SCALEPACK . 57 Crystal parameters and data collection statistics are given in Table I . Model Building and Reﬁnement Molecular replacement was performed by using the program AMoRe . 58 The structure of yeast coﬁlin was used Fig . 4 . A : Trp90 lies in the center of and interacts with a cluster of conserved residues . The tryptophan ring packs against two prolines at positions 61 and 92 , a proline / aromatic typically observed at position 126 , and the hydrophobic side chains of Leu60 and residue 129 . A single hydrogen bond between the indole ring and the backbone carbonyl of residue 61 is conserved in all structures . These interactions constrain the positioning of the loops preceding helices 3 , 4 , and b - strand 4 from which the conserved resi - dues 64 – 66 , Lys100 , and the acidic residues at positions 93 , 123 , and 126 project . Note that the yeast coﬁlin leucine replaces the conventional AC arginine at position 66 , losing the conserved electrostatic interaction with Asp / Glu64 but main - taining the hydrophobic character . This ﬁgure was prepared by using the program O 59 and the coordinates of yeast coﬁlin . 30 B : Stabilizing inter - actions in and around the kink in a - helix 3 . Bending of the a - helix about residue 106 disrupts the a - helical hydrogen bonding pattern between the carbonyl : amide pairs 104 : 108 and 105 : 109 . The hydroxyl group of Tyr103 makes a hydrogen bond to the backbone amide of residue 34 ( not shown ) , whereas the hydroxyl of Tyr67 hydrogen bonds to the backbone carbonyl of residue 103 . Mutagenesisofeitherofthesetyrosinestophenyl - alaninedisruptsorweakensactinbinding , empha - sizing the structural importance of this region . 21 , 45 In the crystal structures of AtADF1 and the phos - phorylated form of actophorin , two water mol - ecules were observed at the kink , each making hydrogen bonds to otherwise unsatisﬁed carbonyl and amide backbone atoms . This ﬁgure was prepared by using the program O 59 and the coordinates of AtADF1 . STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS OF THE ADF / COFILIN FAMILY 381 as the search model ( pdb accession code : 1COF ) with all nonconserved side chains substituted with alanine . This model yielded a crystallographic dimer with an extended b - sheet shared by two monomers . The helical C - terminus of coﬁlin produced serious steric clashes at the crystallo - graphic dimer interface . No density was observed for the C - terminal 15 residues , and this region was removed from the model in the ﬁrst building cycle . Although helical density corresponding to the C - terminus did not appear in the building process , a single tube of density near the C - terminus was consistently observed throughout build - ing and reﬁnement . After most of the AtADF1 side chains were built , the persisting tube of density was identiﬁed as lauryldimethylamine oxide ( LDAO ) on the basis of size , shape , and chemical environment . Building was per - formed by using the program O . 59 The reﬁnement process began with X - PLOR 60 and used CNS 61 in the ﬁnal stages . In the ﬁnal model , the ﬁrst 4 and last 11 residues were omitted . Structural Analysis The pdb accession codes for the structures used in this analysis are 1AK6 / 1AK7 ( human destrin 47 ) , 1COF ( yeast coﬁlin 30 ) , 1AHQ ( Acanthamoeba actophorin 31 ) , 1CNU ( phosphorylated actophorin 32 ) and 1F7S ( Arabidopsis ADF1 , this study ) . Superpositions and r . m . s . d . calcula - tions were performed by using the program O . 59 For analysis of surface topologies , the program GRASP 62 was used to ﬁrst generate molecular surfaces of the three nonvertebrate crystal structures ( yeast coﬁlin , nonphospho - rylated actophorin and AtADF1 ) . With the three nonverte - brate structures superimposed , the distances were calcu - lated between each pair of surfaces . This calculation assigned a minimum distance to each surface vertex corresponding to the nearest surface vertex on the other two surfaces . With the arbitrary cutoff of 1 . 0 Å , it was possible to display only those surface vertices that were , 1 . 0Å from the other two surfaces . As stated in the text , the most topologically conserved surface patches remain - ing after this procedure were essentially surface exposed main - chain and C b atoms . Coordinates The coordinates and experimental amplitudes have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank ( PDB accession code : 1F7S ) .

Blue and red represent the positive and negative electrostatic surface potential of yeast coﬁlin 30 calculated by using the program GRASP . 62 Encircled residues have been shown to reduce or abolish actin binding , whereas residues enclosed with triangles have little effect on binding despite high sequence conservation . 21 , 43 – 46 The ﬁrst ﬁve residues of the N - terminus are disor - dered in the crystal structure ( double circle ) , though their presence is required for actin binding . The hatched surface represents a topologically conserved surface patch in and around the kink of a - helix 3 . The green surface represents a conserved , surface exposed hydrophobic patch contributed by residues 96 – 98 and 100 – 102 . As in Figure 4 , the residue at position 66 is arginine in most AC family members ( leucine in yeast coﬁlin ) and displays electrostatic interactions with Asp / Glu64 in other family members . The orientation in ( A ) is similar to that of Figure 1 . Rotation of ( A ) by 130° about the x - axis yields the orientation in ( B ) . 382 G . D . BOWMAN ET AL . REFERENCES 1 .
