To 14 investigate the distribution and persistence of SARS - CoV - 2 in a quarantine home , samples were 15 collected from a household with two confirmed COVID - 19 cases ( one adult and one child ) . 16 Home surface swab and dust samples were collected two months after symptom onset ( and one 17 month after symptom resolution ) in the household . The strength of the SARS - CoV - 2 molecular 18 signal in fomites varied as a function of sample location , surface material and cleaning practices . 19 Notably , the SARS - CoV - 2 RNA signal was detected at several locations throughout the 20 household although cleaning appears to have attenuated the signal on many surfaces . Of the 24 21 surfaces sampled , 46 % were SARS - CoV - 2 positive at the time of sampling . The SARS - CoV - 2 22 concentrations in dust recovered from floor and HVAC filter samples ranged from 10 4 - 10 5 N2 23 gene copies / g dust . While detection of viral RNA does not imply infectivity , this study confirms 24 that the SARS - CoV - 2 RNA signal can be detected at several locations within a COVID - 19 25 quarantine home and can persist after symptoms have resolved . In addition , the concentration of 26 SARS - CoV - 2 ( normalized per unit mass of dust ) recovered in home HVAC filters may prove 27 useful for estimating SARS - CoV - 2 airborne levels in homes . 28 29 Introduction 30 31 SARS - CoV - 2 transmission inside buildings remains a significant concern as the COVID - 19 32 pandemic continues to surge worldwide . While studies of SARS - CoV - 2 contamination in 33 buildings have focused on locations with outbreaks or medical facilities treating critical COVID - 34 19 patients , most individuals with COVID - 19 spend their recovery period quarantined at home . 35 Reported transmission rates of SARS - CoV - 2 in homes are relatively sparse and vary 36 considerably ( Li et al . , 2020 ; Madewell et al . , 2020 ; Qian et al . , 2020 ; Wang et al . , 2020b ; Wu et 37 al . , 2020 ) . However , household COVID - 19 transmission may be more common than previously 38 recognized with a secondary infection rate of 36 % recently reported for a sample of 101 U . S . 39 households with COVID - 19 ( Lewis et al . , 2020 ) . Unfortunately , the extent to which SARS - CoV - 40 2 contaminates materials within a quarantine home remains poorly understood . Thus , it is 41 difficult to establish if contaminated surfaces or dust reservoirs within a home affect the risk for 42 transmission in households with COVID - 19 . This uncertainty is compounded by the complexity 43 of airborne viral transport in the built environment as well as the effect of occupant cleaning 44 practices on the dispersal and persistence of SARS - CoV - 2 in homes .

Although young children with COVID - 52 19 are often asymptomatic , SARS - CoV - 2 viral loads in children can be high and subsequent 53 infection of parents is possible ( Lopez et al . , 2020 ; Lu et al . , 2020 ) . One important pathway for 54 COVID - 19 transmission is the inhalation of aerosolized SARS - CoV - 2 respiratory droplets 55 generated by an infected individual ( Allen and Marr , 2020 ; Prather et al . , 2020 ) . Larger 56 respiratory droplets will often settle relatively quickly to the floor or other interior surfaces . 57 However , local air currents as well as evaporation of droplets can lead to extended lifetimes . 58 Smaller viral particles can remain airborne for hours or longer ( Allen and Marr , 2020 ) with 59 recent modeling results indicating that these droplets may also be significant drivers of person - 60 to - person transmission ( Augenbraun et al . , 2020 ; Miller et al . , 2020 ) . Given that controlled 61 laboratory studies indicate that SARS - CoV - 2 aerosols may remain infectious for up to 3 hours or 62 even longer in air ( Van Doremalen et al . , 2020 ) , this is a concern for occupants sharing a home . 63 Indeed , experimental studies have verified that a short aerosol release in one room of a house can 64 distribute and eventually settle on surfaces throughout a house ( Tang et al . , 2020 ) . While 65 increasing ventilation is one of the major controls available to reduce airborne exposures to 66 SARS - CoV - 2 in buildings , this can be difficult to achieve in U . S . households where outdoor air 67 ventilation rates are typically low ( Bekö et al . , 2016 ; Shrestha et al . , 2019 ; Yamamoto et al . , 68 2010 ) . Finally , the temperature and relative humidity in homes can also affect the SARS - CoV - 2 69 virus with longer viabilities and airborne survival times expected at lower temperatures and 70 lower humidity levels ( Biryukov et al . , 2020 ; Guillier et al . , 2020 ; Matson et al . , 2020 ) . 71 72 To our knowledge , SARS - CoV - 2 contamination within a quarantine household has not been 73 determined directly . However , measurements of SARS - CoV - 2 distribution in other 74 environments with COVID - 19 occupants ( e . g . , healthcare facilities , quarantine units and cruise 75 ships ) provides insight as to the potential contamination that may be possible ( Chia et al . , 2020 ; 76 Guo et al . , 2020 ; Ong et al . , 2020 ; Santarpia et al . , 2020 ) . In hospitals , for instance , SARS - CoV - 77 2 has been detected on a variety of surfaces ( floors , handrails , and soles of medical staff ) as well 78 as in short - term air samples collected near patients ( Chia et al . , 2020 ; Guo et al . , 2020 ; Ye et al . , 79 2020 ) . The evidence suggests that some contaminated surfaces may serve as reservoirs for 80 resuspension ( Chia et al . , 2020 ; Santarpia et al . , 2020 ) and fecal aerosolization of SARS - CoV - 2 81 during flushing of the toilet is another possibility ( Elsamadony et al . , 2021 ; Liu et al . , 2020 ; Ma 82 et al . , 2020 ) . In the more confined environment of a commercial cruise ship , Yamagishi et al . 83 ( 2020 ) found that 10 % of surface samples in case - cabins were SARS - CoV - 2 positive but almost 84 no positive detections were observed in common area surfaces or in air samples suggesting 85 limited dispersal . Notably , numerous studies have detected SARS - CoV - 2 on the surfaces of 86 ventilation grates or air outlets in buildings with COVID - 19 patients ( Guo et al . , 2020 ; 87 Mouchtouri et al . , 2020 ; Nissen et al . , 2020 ; Santarpia et al . , 2020 ) . Recently , the SARS - CoV - 2 88 virus was detected in 25 % of the swab samples collected from a heating , ventilation and air 89 conditioning ( HVAC ) system in one hospital ( Horve et al . , 2020 ) , and in 36 . 8 % of vent openings 90 and 89 % of HVAC filter dust samples in a COVID - 19 ward ( Nissen et al . , 2020 ) .

( which was not certified by peer review ) The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted December 2 , 2020 . ; https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1101 / 2020 . 11 . 30 . 20234393 doi : medRxiv preprint the SARS - CoV - 2 virus can be recovered from HVAC filter dust is not too surprising given that 92 previous research has demonstrated that filters from central HVAC systems can serve as long - 93 term spatially integrated samplers of the indoor environment . The filter forensics approach has 94 been used for the assessment of particle - bond contaminants that accumulate in the dust collected 95 on HVAC filters ( Bi et al . , 2018 ; Givehchi et al . , 2019 ; Maestre et al . , 2018 ; Noris et al . , 2011 ) 96 including viruses ( Goyal et al . , 2011 ; Prussin et al . , 2016 ) . When this approach is combined with 97 HVAC parameters such as flowrate through the filter and usage time , it is possible to 98 quantitatively estimate the time - averaged indoor concentrations of the particle - bound 99 contaminants ( Givehchi et al . , 2019 ; Haaland and Siegel , 2017 ) . This approach has not yet 100 been used to estimate SARS - CoV - 2 airborne concentrations but this could be possible if the 101 SARS - CoV - 2 concentrations in home HVAC filter dust were known . 102 103 In addition to investigating the dispersal of SARS - CoV - 2 in home environments , the potential 104 for SARS - CoV - 2 to persist on materials and dust reservoirs within homes is an important 105 consideration . Fundamental laboratory studies have demonstrated that SARS - CoV - 2 can survive 106 on paper for up to 3 hours , treated - wood and other low porosity surfaces for up to 24 hours 107 ( Aboubakr et al . , 2020 ; Chin and Poon , 2020 ) . Other studies have shown longer survivability 108 times up to 28 days ( Riddell et al . , 2020 ) at 20°C for high porosity surfaces , such as paper and 109 banknotes . Furthermore , some viruses such as Influenza A can remain infective upon 110 resuspension from surfaces ( Asadi et al . , 2020 ) . 111 112 Cleaning of contaminated surfaces with disinfectants is expected to mitigate the spread of SARS - 113 CoV - 2 in hospitals and other environments including homes ( Hirotsu et al . , 2020 ; Kampf et al . , 114 2020 ; Ong et al . , 2020 ) . Beyond the frequency at which surfaces are sanitized , the effectiveness 115 of cleaning agents vary widely ( Sanekata et al . , 2010 ) . Because SARS - CoV - 2 is an enveloped 116 virus , surfactants , such as soapy water and other household cleaners , are expected to lyse the 117 viral membrane and eliminate the infectivity of the virus on surfaces ( Jahromi et al . , 2020 ) . 118 However , the persistence of SARS - CoV - 2 on surfaces is likely affected by the active ingredient 119 in a given cleaner which , for EPA approved cleaners , includes quaternary ammonium salts , 120 sodium hypochlorite , hydrogen peroxide among several others ( Sanekata et al . , 2010 ; Tuladhar 121 et al . , 2012b ) . 122 123 Investigating SARS - CoV - 2 in homes and other built environments is crucial since the spread of 124 SARS - CoV - 2 is influenced not only by occupant behavior but also by the characteristics of the 125 buildings themselves . While a substantial number of studies have investigated hospitals , 126 quarantine units , restaurants , and cruise ships , additional research is needed in homes where 127 many COVID - 19 patients recover . The objective of this study was to determine the spatial 128 distribution of the SARS - CoV - 2 RNA signal in a quarantine home one month after two 129 household members recovered from COVID - 19 . In addition to examining surface samples , we 130 also quantify the viral signal in dust and surface swab samples from the home environment , 131 providing the first concentration level ( N2 gene copy numbers / g dust ) for HVAC and floor dust 132 samples for comparison with other built environments . 133 134 Methods 135 136 .

The family remained quarantined in their home until symptoms 139 resolved one month after symptoms began . The parent agreed to use a researcher - supplied home 140 sampling kit to obtain samples of the home environment as well as to answer an IRB - approved 141 survey on COVID symptoms and home environment management . All home environment 142 samples were collected by the parent approximately one month after COVID - 19 symptoms had 143 resolved in the household . 144 145 146 Sample Collection 147 148 A total of 22 swab samples were collected from a variety of surfaces across the home as well as 149 from the surface of the HVAC filter . A single phosphate - buffered saline Tween - 20 ( PBST ) 150 wetted swab ( Floq Swab , Copan , Murrieta CA ) was used to swab each of the surfaces for 20 151 seconds . When possible , a 929 cm 2 ( 1ft x1ft ) area was swabbed . In other cases , where the 152 sampling area was difficult to estimate ( e . g . , door handles ) , the entire available surface was 153 swabbed . For the home HVAC filter , a 32 . 26 cm 2 area was swabbed . Dust samples were also 154 collected from the master bedroom floor and from the home HVAC filter via a handheld vacuum 155 cleaner ( Eureka , Medford , MA , USA ) . For each vacuum sample , a new vacuum thimble was 156 inserted into a clean thermoset plastic nozzle ( Indoor Biotechnologies , Charlottesville VA ) 157 attached to the hand - held vacuum cleaner . For floor samples , a 929 cm 2 ( 1ft x1ft ) area was 158 vacuumed for one minute . For HVAC filter dust samples , the whole filter area ( 2064 . 5 cm 2 ; 16 159 inch x 20 inch ) was vacuumed for one minute . All samples were transported on ice and stored at 160 - 20 °C in the laboratory until extraction which occurred within 5 days of sample collection . 161 162 Nucleic acids extraction and RT - qPCR 163 For total nucleic acids extraction , the MagMAX ä Total Nucleic Acids extraction kit 164 ( ThermoFisher Eugene , Oregon , USA ) was used in combination with the KingFisher 165 ( ThermoFisher ) nucleic acid extractor . At the beginning of sample processing , the dust cake 166 from vacuum samples and the swabs were transferred to the extraction kit bead beating tubes 167 ( ThermoFisher ) and processed per manufacturer’s instructions . 168 169 The concentration of SARS - CoV - 2 in RNA extracts was determined in triplicate on the ViiA7 170 Real - Time PCR System ( ThermoFisher ) . RT - qPCR utilized the CDC nCOV _ N2 primer / probe 171 and CDC nCOV _ N1 primer / probe set ( Lu et al . , 2020 ) ( Integrated DNA Technologies ) . Standard 172 curves were developed using the 2019 - nCoV _ N _ Positive Control ( Integrated DNA 173 Technologies , Coralville , USA ) . Samples were analyzed using the TaqMan™ Fast Virus 1 - Step 174 Master Mix in 20 - µ l reactions run at 50 °C for 5 min , 95 °C for 20s , followed by 40 cycles of 175 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 60 s per the manufacturer’s recommendations . The limit of detection 176 was established at 82 N1 gene copies recovered per sample , and 56 N2 gene copies recovered 177 per sample ( see Supplemental Information ) . To ensure the quality of the results , all qPCR 178 analyses were performed in triplicate and positive controls ( synthetic SARS - CoV - 2 , IDT CDC ) 179 as well as negative controls ( PCR grade water ) were used in each RT - qPCR plate . Additionally , 180 negative controls were included in the study and processed concurrently with the samples to 181 account for background material and reagent contamination . All negative controls indicated no 182 .

The bovine respiratory 183 syncytial virus ( BRSV ) was utilized to evaluate viral recoveries from each of the matrices ( swabs 184 and dust ) collected in this study as is done in other environmental studies ( Gonzalez et al . , 2020 ) . 185 186 Home Data 187 Both participants lived full - time in the case study home before the onset of COVID - 19 188 symptoms , during the disease period , and after the recovery period when the samples were 189 collected . The two bedroom 93 m 2 ( 1 , 000 ft 2 ) home located in Texas was built between 2008 and 190 2012 , and had a central HVAC system with a Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value ( MERV ) 4 191 ( fiberglass filament , Flanders E - Z Flow II ) filter installed . 192 193 Survey Data 194 Information regarding COVID - 19 symptoms , cleaning practices , and surface materials ( Table 1 ) 195 were gathered via remote survey utilizing the Research Electronic Data Capture ( REDCap ) 196 platform ( Harris et al . , 2019 ; Harris et al . , 2009 ) . For surfaces such as carpet and hard flooring , 197 the frequency of vacuum and mopping were also reported . The survey was administered entirely 198 remotely via a survey link sent to the participant ' s phone , made possible with the REDCap 199 platform . 200 201 Quantitative Filter Forensics 202 The quantitative filter forensics approach by Haaland and Siegel ( 2017 ) was used in this work 203 ( Table S2 ) to estimate the temporally and spatially integrated airborne concentration ( C ) of 204 SARS - CoV - 2 over the viral collection time period . The following parameters were used for the 205 calculation : m was the mass of dust ( g ) collected in the HVAC filter , f was the concentration of 206 SARS - CoV - 2 ( N2 gene copies / g ) in the dust collected on the filter , ƞ was the integrated 207 particulate matter filtration efficiency of the MERV - 4 filter , Q was the volumetric air flowrate 208 ( m 3 / h ) through the filter ( median for the summer season for the same geographical 209 location , ( Givehchi et al . , 2019 ) and t was the runtime of the HVAC system ( h ) over the duration 210 of the SARS - CoV - 2 collection time - approximately one month - , median for the summer season 211 for the same geographical location , ( Givehchi et al . , 2019 ) . A few considerations that ought to be 212 taken into account are : ( 1 ) our estimate does not account for the attenuation of the signal over 213 time or the losses due to deposition , ( 2 ) it considers the estimate that approximately 5 . 5 % of the 214 viral signal is recovered through RNA extraction from the dust matrix ( as estimated in this work 215 via the spike and recovery tests for the surrogate BRSV virus ) , ( 3 ) the mass recovered by the 216 participants was estimated to be 68 % of that recoverable by trained researcher ( based on 217 previous experiments comparing researcher - collected samples to participant - collected samples ) , 218 and ( 4 ) that approximately 27 % of the accumulated dust can be recovered from the filter 219 ( Mahdavi and Siegel , 2020 ) . Owing to the use of averaged parameters from a similar population 220 of homes and analysis approaches , our estimate should be considered a scaling approach rather 221 than a precise calculation of SARS - CoV - 2 airborne concentration . 222 223 Results 224 225 Ventilation and Temperature Settings 226 The home was naturally ventilated one hour per day , in the early morning by opening one door . 227 The HVAC temperature setting was kept at 23 . 9°C ( 75°F ) day and night with the air 228 .

In our 230 previous study in Texas ( Bi et al . , 2018 ) , the average relative humidity in homes during the 231 summer was 56 . 6 % ± 5 . 2 % ( n = 93 , measured over one month ) . Even though indoor relative 232 humidity varies as a function of temperature , outdoor relative humidity , occupancy and other 233 building factors , this provides us with a reasonable estimate for homes in this study . Regarding 234 the position of the HVAC filter , the low efficiency filter ( MERV - 4 ) was positioned vertically in 235 the unit 3 feet above floor height . The HVAC unit was located inside a closet with a louvered 236 door that was normally kept closed . 237 238 SARS - CoV - 2 on Surfaces across the Home 239 A total of 24 surfaces distributed across six spaces in the home were swabbed on the same day 240 approximately one month after the symptoms of both participants had resolved . A total of 46 % 241 of the samples were found to be positive ( Table 1 , Figure 1 ) . In some cases , a specific area was 242 sampled ( HVAC filter , counters , floors , and highchair ) and the results are reported in N2 gene 243 copies / cm 2 ( Fig . 2A ) , whereas in other cases when it was not feasible to normalize by area - or by 244 weight - ( e . g . , swabbing doorknobs , handles , among others ) , the results are reported as N2 gene 245 copies recovered per swab ( Fig 2B ) . 246 247 Table 1 .

The vinyl couch as well as the child’s toy , the toilet 278 handle , and the doorknob to the master bedroom showed similar viral signal strengths ( ~ 100 N2 279 gene copies recovered per swab ) . The surfaces in the bathroom did not yield any SARS - CoV - 2 280 signal , except for the toilet handle . The remaining doorknobs ( second bedroom and main door ) 281 and handles tested , including the kitchen sink handle and refrigerator handle , as well as the cell 282 phone screen , did not yield any signal .

For 287 vinyl flooring in the living room and kitchen , Cleaner 1 ( active ingredient : glycolic acid ) was 288 used once per day , except in the case of the bathroom floor , where Cleaner 2 ( active ingredient : 289 alkyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride ) was generally utilized . For doorknobs , Cleaner 1 was 290 utilized once per day . The rest of flooring in both bedrooms was carpeted . The floor in the main 291 bedroom ( the only one occupied at the time ) was vacuumed once per day . In the kitchen , Cleaner 292 3 ( active ingredient : sodium laureth sulfate ) was employed to clean surfaces such as the counters , 293 the dinner table , as well as the refrigerator and sink handles . In the bathroom , Cleaner 2 was used 294 on all surfaces including the sink , toilet handle and toilet seat . Some portable objects were 295 cleaned with Cleaner 2 , including the participant’s phone , and the child’s toys , cleaned daily and 296 2 - 3 times per week respectively . The highchair was cleaned three times per day with water . 297 Other surfaces , such as door trims , the couch , the TV , or the HVAC filter were not cleaned 298 routinely . 299 300 301 Figure 3 .

Among the fomites that can be cleaned frequently , those that were 309 vacuumed , not cleaned at all , or cleaned with water only , yielded higher SARS - CoV - 2 signal 310 than those cleaned with commercial cleaning products . Another factor that may affect the signal 311 is the cleaning regime ( Table 1 , Fig . S2 ) with frequent cleaning of surfaces expected to deplete 312 the signal . 313 314 315 SARS - CoV - 2 in vacuumed dust samples 316 317 The viral signal ranged from 10 5 to 10 6 N2 gene copies / g in the floor dust samples collected via 318 the handheld vacuum ( Fig . 4 ) . The viral signal in the HVAC filter dust ranged from 10 4 to 10 5 319 copies / g of dust . The concentrations found in the dust from the carpeted master bedroom floor 320 were significantly higher than those in the HVAC filter dust ( Mann - Whitney , p - val < 0 . 001 ) . In 321 both cases , the SARS - CoV - 2 signal varied by at least an order of magnitude in the dust samples . 322 As a negative control , vacuum HVAC filter dust samples collected a year prior to the COVID - 19 323 pandemic were also tested and yielded no signal . 324 325 326 327 Fig 4 .

To estimate 340 the effect that matrix can have on viral recoveries ( Gonzalez et al . , 2020 ) , the BRSV was used to 341 estimate the viral recovery from swab and dust samples , In this work , when the RNA of a known 342 amount of virus was extracted with no matrix - , approximately 30 % of the signal was recovered 343 ( Fig . S3 ) . When the same quantity of virus was spiked onto a swab ( the same kind used in the 344 current study ) , approximately 25 % of the signal was recovered . However , in the case of BRSV 345 spikes into dust samples , a median of approximately 6 % was recovered from the filter dust and 346 approximately 8 % from the floor dust . As a reference , 7 . 6 % recovery was observed for BRSV in 347 wastewater samples and fungal recoveries from wipe samples have been reported to range from 348 10 % to 25 % Gonzalez et al . , 2020 ; Yamamoto et al . , 2011 ) . Similarly , Yang et al . ( 2011 ) 349 reported 50 % recovery of the virus H1N1 spiked onto PTFE filters while Brown et al . ( 2020 ) 350 could recover between 1 % and 10 % the foot - and - mouth disease virus in their liquid control with 351 generally lower recoveries reported from surfaces , suggesting non - negligible losses . While it is 352 known that different microorganisms , matrices , surface materials , and virus concentrations 353 ( Brown et al . , 2020 ; Fabian et al . , 2009 ; Zuo et al . , 2013 ) can behave differently , the recovery 354 values determined in the present work are within the range reported in other studies of viruses 355 and other microorganisms . Still , the actual recovery of SARS - CoV - 2 from many environmental 356 matrices remains largely unknown . 357 358 Discussion 359 360 Secondary SARS - CoV - 2 infections can occur within households when a COVID - 19 individual 361 isolates at home ( Grijalva et al . , 2020 ; Lewis et al . , 2020 ; Wang et al . , 2020a ; Wu et al . , 2020 ) . 362 In fact , home related outbreaks can be common as evidenced in the study by Qian et al . ( 2020 ) 363 where 254 of 318 outbreaks ( 79 . 9 % ) were found to have originated in the home indoor 364 environment . Wang et al . ( 2020a ) found that measures such as home ventilation and frequent 365 cleaning of surfaces were protective against secondary infections . In this work , we detected 366 SARS - CoV - 2 ( confirmed via N2 and N1 gene assays ) across several locations within a home one 367 month after the symptoms of the two COVID - 19 positive occupants had subsided . The SARS - 368 CoV - 2 signal was found in at least one fomite in every room sampled , including in rooms not in 369 active use . In addition , SARS - CoV - 2 was detected in dust from floors and from the HVAC filter 370 installed in the home . We found that 46 % of the surfaces had detectable SARS - CoV - 2 signal . In 371 other studies ( Chia et al . , 2020 ) , similar detection rates ( ~ 40 % ) were found in rooms with 372 patients in their first week of disease but the rates declined below 20 % as the disease progressed . 373 Many factors could have contributed to these observed differences . In our study , the strength of 374 the viral signal seemed to vary with sample location , fomite surface material , occupant contact 375 level , and cleaning practices . 376 377 Some of the SARS - CoV - 2 positive surfaces , such as HVAC filters , floors , and the top of the TV , 378 are common reservoirs for dust build - up and might be infrequently touched ; however , others are 379 high - touch surfaces such as doorknobs , tables and , handles . The viral signals recovered in the 380 current study ( median = 966 N2 gene copies recovered per swab sample ) were lower than the 381 .

Several relevant factors could explain these differences . First , it is possible 384 that the viral signal in the study house attenuated as time passed after symptoms disappeared 385 whereas the studies in hospitals and quarantine units were normally conducted in or near rooms 386 with active COVID - 19 cases . In the quarantine unit study by Santarpia et al . ( 2020 ) , the rooms 387 were negatively pressurized with > 12 ACH whereas in homes , these ventilation levels are 388 unlikely to be present in air conditioned homes that are closed most of the time . In the present 389 study , the ACH during cooling was not measured although the home was naturally ventilated one 390 hour per day . Finally , the home was cleaned frequently whereas in Santarpia et al . ( 2020 ) , the 391 authors mentioned frequent environmental cleaning but many details were not specified 392 ( cleaning regime , products ) , making the comparison difficult . 393 394 In some cases , the SARS - CoV - 2 RNA signal can be normalized by sampling area , which may be 395 a useful metric to compare to other studies . The highest concentrations of N2 gene copies / cm 2 396 were recovered from the HVAC filter ( average 43 , 000 N2 gene copies / cm 2 ) , which was in place 397 throughout the period of illness and recovery . Other surfaces , such as the floor in the master 398 bedroom and the second room , both carpeted and vacuum - cleaned , and the child’s highchair , 399 cleaned with water , yielded signal but at lower concentrations ( ~ 5 , ~ 20 and ~ 125 copies / cm 2 , 400 respectively ) . Comparing to samples gathered in hospitals , in Feng et al . ( 2021 ) 38 copies / cm 2 401 were found at the patient’s bedside wall surface but lower concentrations in the toilet bowl and 402 floor drainage ( 4 and 2 copies / cm 2 , respectively ) . In this study , samples gathered from the vinyl 403 bathroom floor and living room floor , both cleaned with Cleaner 1 , as well as the dinner table 404 and kitchen counter ( cleaned with Cleaner 3 ) , yielded non - detects . It is noteworthy that 4 . 8 N2 405 gene copies / cm 2 ( nearly 100 N2 gene copies recovered per swab ) were recovered in the 406 unoccupied second bedroom . Many explanations are possible , including the possibility of 407 tracking the virus in via walking , redistribution of viral particles via the HVAC system , or 408 penetration of the virus from the occupied portion to the unoccupied bedroom via cracks and 409 gaps in the doorframe . Evidence is mounting supporting the possibility of long travel distance of 410 SARS - CoV - 2 virus - laden particles in the built environment ( Allen and Marr , 2020 ; Chen et al . , 411 2020a ; Morawska and Cao , 2020 ) . Tang et al . ( 2020 ) found that aerosols released indoors 412 dispersed and deposited across the open spaces , even within closets and cabinets with closed 413 doors and drawers . Thus , the presence of viral signal in the not - in - use room carpeted floor is not 414 unreasonable . Among the samples not normalized by area , the signal observed on the top of the 415 television ( nearly 10 , 000 N2 gene copies / swab ) was significantly higher than the other samples . 416 The static charge and lack of cleaning at this location leads to an accumulation of dust , 417 suggesting that it could be a good reservoir to sample in home environmental studies , as reported 418 elsewhere ( Dunn et al . , 2013 ) . 419 420 Of particular note , the SARS - CoV - 2 signal recovered by swabbing the HVAC filter in this study 421 yielded an average viral signal of 38 , 815 N2 gene copies recovered per swab , higher than those 422 recovered in the biocontainment and quarantine unit study . Horve et al . ( 2020 ) found SARS - 423 CoV - 2 viral copies in hospital HVAC pre - filters and filters at lower levels ( ~ 450 cumulative 424 copies across the pre - filters and two filters that were positive ) . Even though the levels found in 425 the present work are higher , the direct comparison is difficult due to several aspects . First , home 426 and hospital HVAC systems differ in their in their function ; home systems provide greater air 427 .

( which was not certified by peer review ) The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted December 2 , 2020 . ; https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1101 / 2020 . 11 . 30 . 20234393 doi : medRxiv preprint recirculation , whereas in hospital systems , outdoor air is mixed in to provide higher air exchange 428 rates . The second main difference is the total volume of filtered air per surface sampled . Finally , 429 the cumulative time the filters were in use may be different between the two systems . With the 430 current available information , we are unable to determine the full influence of these significant 431 factors . Nissen et al . ( 2020 ) found viral signal in air vents and filters 50 meters away from 432 patients in a low relative humidity environment ( approximately 30 % ) , but they could not detect 433 growth or infectivity , and hypothesized that the virus may have been inactive due to desiccation 434 of the pathogen in the vents . 435 436 Recent studies have shown a variability in the survivability of the virus in surfaces , depending on 437 the material , temperature , relative humidity , and light , with all of these factors playing an 438 important role ( Riddell et al . , 2020 ; Van Doremalen et al . , 2020 ; Wolff et al . , 2005 ) . Whereas 439 one study showed that SARS - CoV - 2 survives for up to 7 days in some materials ( Aboubakr et 440 al . , 2020 ; Chin and Poon , 2020 ) , other studies have shown longer survivability times up to 28 441 days ( Riddell et al . , 2020 ) in the dark , at 20 °C and 50 % RH . Considering the time that had 442 passed after the participants’ symptoms disappeared , the RH average estimate from our previous 443 study in Texas ( 56 . 6 % ± 5 . 2 % , ( Bi et al . , 2018 ) ) , and the temperature setting for the study house 444 ( 23 . 9 °C , 75 °F ) , we hypothesize that the viral signal detected may have been from inactive 445 virus . However , additional studies that address infectivity of SARS - CoV - 2 recovered from 446 home surface and dust samples as a function of time , material properties and cleaning practices 447 would be required to address this question . 448 449 Another factor that may affect the signal recovered from the built environment is the cleaning 450 regime ( Fig . S2 ) and the cleaning products used ( Table 1 , Table S1 ) . In the present study , the 451 frequent cleaning of floors and many of the high touch surfaces with cleaning products may 452 explain the low to no signal found on many surfaces . Surfactants from household cleaners can 453 break the viral membrane of the enveloped SARS - CoV - 2 virus ( Jahromi et al . 2020 ) . For 454 example , all surfaces in the bathroom cleaned regularly with Cleaner 2 ( sink handle , toilet seat , 455 and floor ) did not yield any SARS - COV - 2 signal , except in the case of the toilet handle 456 suggesting that viral shedding in stool could have happened . Studies have found SARS - CoV - 2 457 presence in stool samples up to 28 days after hospital admission ( Xu et al . , 2020 ) , 6 - 10 days after 458 negative nasopharyngeal swabs ( Chen et al . , 2020b ) . However , it is important to recognize that 459 the viral signal detected in the toilet handle could also have settled there via transport from 460 another area of the home . The persistence of the SARS - CoV - 2 RNA signal on surfaces likely 461 varies widely due to the active ingredient within the cleaner used . Quaternary ammonium , a 462 compound found in Cleaner 2 in this study as well as in a majority of EPA recommended 463 cleaners , has been shown to be effective against viruses ( Shirai et al . , 2000 ; Tuladhar et al . , 464 2012a ) such as the enveloped murine norovirus ( MNV - 1 ) and feline calicivirus ( FCV ) ( Kennedy 465 et al . 1995 ) . 466 467 Ma et al . ( 2020 ) found that COVID - 19 positive patients in early stages had breath emission rates 468 estimated to range from 1 . 03x10 5 to 2 . 25x10 7 viruses per hour . It is likely that the concentrations 469 would be lower towards the end of the recovery period as reported in sputum samples elsewhere 470 ( Wölfel et al . , 2020 ) . Taking into account the two COVID - 19 positive dwellers , the length of 471 their quarantine and ventilation mode ( a door opened during one hour per day plus infiltration ) , it 472 is reasonable that viral particles accumulated in the case study home . In this study , significant 473 .

( which was not certified by peer review ) The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted December 2 , 2020 . ; https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1101 / 2020 . 11 . 30 . 20234393 doi : medRxiv preprint viral signals were recovered from the dust from both the main bedroom floor and the HVAC 474 filter . Even though the floors of the study home were vacuumed frequently , the viral signal in the 475 carpeted floor from the master bedroom was above 10 5 N2 gene copies / gram of dust , suggesting 476 that the viral signal may be difficult to remove just by vacuuming . As indicated in Staudt et al . 477 ( 2020 ) , the highest viral loads can be found on floors and airborne aerosols can be formed from 478 resuspension of settled dust or aerosols . In the present work , the signal found in the HVAC filter 479 dust was an order of magnitude lower than that recovered from the floors . In both cases , the viral 480 concentration in each dust sample type varied by at least an order of magnitude indicating that 481 replicate analyses are needed to represent the heterogeneity of the dust . Solely for context , 482 having not found other works providing SARS - COV - 2 concentrations per gram of dust , the 483 concentrations measured in this work are on the same order of magnitude or even higher than 484 those found in stool from COVID - 19 positive patients at the peak of their symptoms ( Wölfel et 485 al . , 2020 ) but lower than those found in other cases ( Lescure et al . , 2020 ) . 486 487 The virus is not expelled naked but attached to larger respiratory fluid particles , forming both 488 droplets and aerosols that can be involved in transmission ( Prather et al . , 2020 ) . Filters can 489 remove airborne viruses , but their efficiency varies significantly . Low MERV filters are not very 490 efficient at removing smaller particles with , for example , filters rated MERV 5 and below are 491 reported to remove less than 25 % of particles smaller than 10 µ m ( Azimi et al . , 2014 ) . As a 492 result , only a fraction of viral aerosols may be retained in the filter in a single pass although our 493 results suggest removal and accumulation can occur over time . Notably , we found a strong viral 494 signal in the HVAC filter dust , located inside a closet with a closed louvered door . This indicates 495 the viral - laden particles were at some point airborne ( either after being expelled or after being 496 resuspended ) . Low efficiency filters , frequently used because of their low cost , primarily act as a 497 ‘roughing filter’ , removing large particulate matter to protect the HVAC system . In order to 498 enhance capture of viral - laden particles in a home ( and potentially diminish the redistribution of 499 viruses across the home ) , high MERV filters could be used . 500 501 This work indicates that it is possible to detect the previous presence of a viral shedding 502 individual in the built environment via HVAC filter forensics and suggest this approach may be 503 useful for SARS - CoV - 2 monitoring in home environments . In addition , using the 504 QFF methodology ( Haaland and Siegel , 2017 ) , we estimated an average integrated airborne 505 SARS - CoV - 2 concentration of 90 copies / m 3 ( see Table S2 for more details ) . This value can serve 506 for future comparisons of concentrations of SARS - CoV - 2 in the built environment and help 507 building scientists and engineers as they strive to develop best practices in homes with COVID - 508 19 positive occupants . Studies of the viral signal decay and infectivity in HVAC filter dust are 509 warranted to further determine the usability and limits of this approach , and future work should 510 include direct measurements of HVAC and extraction parameters to better characterize the 511 integrated SARS - CoV - 2 concentrations . Because HVAC filter dust represents a pooled sample , 512 contributed to by all occupants in a building over an extended period of time , repeated 513 monitoring could be used to identify spikes in measured viral concentrations in the dust . These 514 spikes could indicate new or active infections and be used to guide additional isolation or 515 ventilation practices to minimize the spread of the virus . 516 517 As the body of literature increases , it seems clear that in order to diminish viral loads and 518 decrease the probablity of in - home secondary transmission in the built environment , efficient 519 .

In addition , several factors that may affect the 523 distribution of SARS - CoV - 2 across a home have been identified . The results indicate that 524 cleaning can greatly reduce or eliminate the SARS - CoV - 2 signal on surfaces . Also , even a low 525 efficiency home filter is capable of capturing and retaining SARS - CoV - 2 . The detection of the 526 SARS - CoV - 2 RNA signal on infrequently touched surfaces indicates that airborne particles 527 settle out of the air , potentially contaminating surfaces not in direct contact with COVID - 19 528 positive individuals . As the COVID - 19 pandemic continues , the SARS - CoV - 2 transmission 529 pathways continue to be widely debated . Homes are essential environments that warrant further 530 study to better understand SARS - CoV - 2 aerosols and fomites in the home environment where 531 many COVID - 19 individuals recover . 532 533 Limitations of the Study 534 This study has several limitations . First , the distribution of the SARS - CoV - 2 RNA signal across 535 a single quarantine household was investigated at one time point two months after COVID - 19 536 symptom onset . Additional quarantine homes during and after COVID - 19 infections should be 537 studied to determine the temporal course of SARS - CoV - 2 distribution within homes as well as to 538 investigate how different household factors affect this distribution across a wide variety of home 539 types . Second , viral culturing was not performed to determine virus viability / infectivity ; thus , 540 this work only reports SARS - CoV - 2 viral signal found independently of its viability . Future 541 studies are needed to establish the whether there are infective viruses in samples obtained from 542 home environments . Finally , the current study is based on the recovery of SARS - CoV - 2 RNA 543 from a range of sample types . It is well established that recovery of RNA from environmental 544 samples is often attenuated by losses during the extraction process or retention within the sample 545 matrix . Thus , future studies are warranted to investigate these effects as the recovery of SARS - 546 CoV - 2 from many complex sample matrices such as dust have not been established . 547 548 549 Acknowledgements 550 551 This work was supported by Whole Communities—Whole Health , a research grand challenge at 552 the University of Texas at Austin .
