The WASP relative , WAVE , regulates lamellipodia formation within a 400 kDa , hetero - pentameric WAVE Regulatory Complex ( WRC ) . The WRC is inactive toward the Arp2 / 3 complex , but can be stimulated by the Rac GTPase , kinases and phosphatidylinositols . We report the 2 . 3 Å crystal structure of the WRC and complementary mechanistic analyses . The structure shows that the activity - bearing VCA motif of WAVE is sequestered by a combination of intramolecular and intermolecular contacts within the WRC . Rac and kinases appear to destabilize a WRC element that is necessary for VCA sequestration , suggesting how these signals stimulate WRC activity toward the Arp2 / 3 complex . Spatial proximity of the Rac binding site and a large basic surface of the WRC suggests how the GTPase and phospholipids could cooperatively recruit the complex to membranes . Members of the Wiskott - Aldrich Syndrome Protein ( WASP ) family play central roles in the control of cellular actin dynamics 1 - 3 . These proteins receive information from multiple signaling pathways and respond by promoting the actin nucleating activity of the ubiquitous Arp2 / 3 complex . In this way , WASP proteins control actin assembly spatially and temporally in processes including cell migration , polarization , adhesion , and vesicle trafficking .

A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t The WASP family is defined by a conserved C - terminal VCA motif ( for Verprolin - homology , Central and Acidic regions ) , which binds and activates the Arp2 / 3 complex 1 , 3 . This element must be tightly regulated to ensure proper spatial and temporal control over actin assembly . In the best understood family members , WASP and N - WASP , the VCA is autoinhibited by intramolecular interactions with a regulatory element termed the GTPase binding domain ( GBD ) 4 . Various ligands can bind to WASP / N - WASP simultaneously , and destabilize GBD - VCA contacts , leading to activation 1 , 3 . Activation of all family members appears to be restricted to membranes . Superimposed on allosteric control and coupled with membrane recruitment , the activity of WASP proteins can be substantially increased by dimerization , or more generally oligomerization / clustering at membranes 5 . While WASP and N - WASP can exist independently in cells , WAVE proteins are constitutively associated with four additional proteins in cells : Sra1 / Cyfip1 , Nap1 / Hem - 2 , Abi and HSPC300 6 , 7 . The components of this ~ 400 kDa pentamer , termed the WAVE regulatory complex ( WRC ) have all been implicated in control of Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated actin assembly in a wide range of systems 1 , 8 . Sra1 / Cyfip1 also plays a distinct role in translational control 9 , 10 . WAVE proteins lack an inhibitory GBD , and the mechanism of VCA regulation within the WRC is not known . The WRC can be activated by a wide range of stimuli , including the Rac GTPase and acidic phospholipids 6 , 11 - 14 , which appear to act cooperatively at the plasma membrane 12 , 14 . Furthermore , components of the WRC can be phosphorylated at numerous positions ( http : / / www . phosphosite . org ) , with some modifications enhancing signaling activity 14 - 19 . The mechanisms by which ligands act individually and cooperatively to recruit and activate the WRC are not known . Here we report the 2 . 3 Å crystal structure of the WRC and complementary biochemical and cell biological analyses . The combined data reveal how the WAVE VCA is inhibited within the complex and provide plausible mechanisms for WRC activation by Rac and phosphorylation , and for cooperative membrane recruitment by Rac and phospholipids . Our analyses provide an integrated picture of how the WRC orchestrates multiple signaling pathways to control actin polymerization at the plasma membrane . Overall structure of the WRC To facilitate crystallization of the WRC we genetically deleted the C - terminal proline - rich region and SH3 domain of Abi2 , and replaced the proline - rich region of WAVE1 with an 18 - residue linker . Sra1 , Nap1 and HSPC300 were full - length . The resulting miniWRC is inactive toward the Arp2 / 3 complex but can be stimulated by Rac1 - GMPPNP 13 . Crystals of miniWRC contained one complex in the asymmetric unit and diffracted to 2 . 3 Å at a synchrotron light source . Phases were obtained by multiple isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering ( MIRAS ) using preparations containing selenomethionine - labeled Sra1 and Nap1 ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . The final structure was refined to R work / R free = 18 . 8 % / 23 . 7 % . MiniWRC has an elongated shape with approximate dimensions of 200 × 110 × 80 Å ( Fig . 1 ) . Two - dimensional class averages from electron micrographs of negatively stained miniWRC and full - length WRC are indistinguishable , and of similar Chen et al . Page 2 Nature .

A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t dimensions as the crystal structure ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . The structure of miniWRC is thus likely a faithful representation of the structured elements of the WRC . MiniWRC can be delineated into two subcomplexes : an Sra1 : Nap1 dimer and a WAVE1 : Abi2 : HSPC300 trimer ( Fig . 1 ) . Sra1 and Nap1 have homologous structures ( see below ) and interact extensively to create an elongated pseudo - symmetric dimer , which forms a platform for the trimer ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . The N - terminal helix of Sra1 links to the rest of the complex through a flexible sequence that lacks electron density ( residues 23 - 56 ) , and contacts an adjacent molecule in the crystal lattice ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . The trimer contacts the Sra1 : Nap1 dimer in a tripartite manner . A long four - helix bundle created by a helix from HSPC300 ( residues 14 - 68 ) , two helices from Abi2 ( residues 1 - 39 and 43 - 112 ) and a helix from WAVE1 ( residues 26 - 81 ) contacts Sra1 extensively and is aligned roughly parallel to the long axis of the dimer ( Supplementary Figs . 4 and 5 ) . The most extensive contacts are made by HSPC300 , which is sandwiched between Sra1 and Abi2 : WAVE1 across the entire length of its helix . The ‘homeo - domain homologous region’ of Abi2 ( residues 112 - 155 ) 20 adopts an extended conformation running around the rim of a large cavity on Nap1 ( Supplementary Fig . 6 ) . The C - terminus of WAVE1 , including the V - and the C - regions , forms an irregular , loosely - packed chain that lies against a concave surface of Sra1 adjacent to the long side of the four - helix bundle . As detailed below , interactions of elements in the C - terminus of WAVE1 with Sra1 and each other are central to regulation of WRC activity . The structure reveals that Sra1 and Nap1 have the same domain organization ; their coordinates can be superimposed with a root mean square deviation ( r . m . s . d . ) of 6 . 9 Å for 681 C α atoms with Dali Z - score 17 . 9 ( Supplementary Fig . 7 ) 21 . Thus , they belong to the same protein family despite their low sequence identity ( 13 % ) . Homology between Sra1 and Nap1 is also supported by HHpred 22 , which showed additional human members of this family that are similar in size : KIAA1033 / SWIP and Strumpellin , with similarity extending over their entire lengths . When analyzed pair wise , SWIP is more similar to Sra1 and Strumpellin is more similar to Nap1 . We and others recently reported that SWIP and Strumpellin form a pentameric complex ( SHRC , for WASH Regulatory Complex ) containing the proteins CCDC53 and Fam21 , and another WASP family member , WASH 23 , 24 , 25 . Within the SHRC the WASH VCA is inactive 23 . HHpred and biochemical analyses suggest that CCD53 , and the N - termini of WASH and Fam21 are structurally and / or functionally similar to HSPC300 and the N - termini of WAVE and Abi , respectively 23 . These many similarities , coupled with the similar overall shape of the WRC and SHRC 23 , suggest that the SHRC is analogously organized as a large SWIP : Strumpellin platform bound to a helical bundle of WASH : CCDC53 : Fam21 , with the WASH VCA sequestered by a similar mechanism . We validated the structural organization observed in the crystal by replacing wild type WAVE2 in HeLa cells with mutants targeting the trimer interface . Mutating the WAVE - HSPC300 interface ( I50D / L54D WAVE2 ) or the WAVE - HSPC300 / Abi interface ( L40D / F51D WAVE2 ) appreciably decreased co - immunoprecipitation of WAVE2 with the four other components of the WRC ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) , consistent with structural predictions .

A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t Mechanism of WRC inhibition The structure explains the inhibited nature of the WRC . In the complex , the WAVE1 VCA is bound by a conserved surface of Sra1 and residues 82 - 184 of WAVE1 , which form five helices ( α 2 - α 6 ) and a series of intervening loops . This element of WAVE1 traces a meandering path across a concave surface of Sra1 , and we refer to it as the “meander region” ( Fig . 2a and Supplementary Fig . 8 ) . Contacts between the meander region and Sra1 bury over 2 , 100 Å 2 ( ~ 56 % of the total WAVE1 - Sra1 interface ; Supplementary Fig . 9 ) . The meander sequence is highly conserved among the different WAVE proteins ( Supplementary Fig . 8 ) , as is its contact surface on Sra1 , suggesting its interactions and irregular structure are conserved . The V - and C - regions of the VCA lie on the surface of Sra1 and form two amphipathic helices ( residues 500 - 514 and 531 - 543 , respectively ) that also pack against α 2 and α 6 of WAVE1 , respectively ( Supplementary Fig . 10 ) . The A - region of the VCA ( residues 545 - 559 ) is likely disordered , as it is not observed in the electron density . During actin filament nucleation , the V - region recruits an initial actin monomer to the nascent filament , while the C - and A - regions contribute binding energy and induce activating conformational changes in the Arp2 / 3 complex 26 , 27 . The structure and complementary experimental data below indicate that sequestration of both the V - and the C - regions by Sra1 and the meander region of WAVE1 underlies VCA inhibition within the WRC . Inhibition of the V - region involves a combination of contacts to actin - binding residues and induction of structure that is incompatible with actin binding ( Fig . 2b ) . In the complex of the V - region of WAVE2 with actin 28 , residues equivalent to 497 - 507 of WAVE1 form a helix that inserts into the cleft between actin subdomains 1 and 3 . Residues equivalent to 508 - 516 are extended , and the Ile509 and Arg512 equivalents contact actin . In the structure of miniWRC , the entire V - region is helical , and the side chains of Leu 501 , Leu 502 , Ile 505 , Ile 509 and Arg 512 are buried in the Sra1 interface , making the V - region inaccessible to actin . Sequestration of the V - region is an important contributor to WRC inhibition , as mutating V - helix contact residues Leu 841 , Phe 844 and Trp 845 of Sra1 constitutively activates miniWRC toward the Arp2 / 3 complex ( L841A / F844A / W845A Sra1 - miniWRC , Fig . 2d ) , producing branched filaments ( Supplementary Fig . 11 ) . The C - helix is also critical for activation of Arp2 / 3 complex 29 , as mutations of Val 531 , Leu 535 or Arg 538 in the WAVE1 VCA reduce activity toward Arp2 / 3 complex by at least 50 % . In the miniWRC , the C - helix buries its hydrophobic face in the Sra1 - α 6 interface ( Fig . 2c , Supplementary Figs . 8 and 9 ) . Intermolecularly , Val 531 , Ala 532 , Leu 535 and Ile 539 of WAVE1 make van der Waals contacts with Sra1 . Intramolecularly , Val 531 , Ile 534 , Leu 535 , Arg 538 and Val 541 of the C - helix pack against α 6 . Hence , the structure shows that the WRC sequesters C - helix residues important for activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex , resulting in inhibition . This mechanism is also supported by mutagenesis : perturbing contacts of the C - helix with either Sra1 ( L697D / Y704D Sra1 - miniWRC , Fig . 2d ) or the α 6 helix ( W161E / K162D WAVE1 - miniWRC , Fig . 2e ) leads to constitutive activation of the miniWRC in vitro . Additionally , replacement of wild type WAVE2 with equivalent levels of the analogous α 6 mutant ( W160E / K161D WAVE2 ) in HeLa cells does not alter the integrity Chen et al . Page 4 Nature .

A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t of the complex ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) , but causes a dramatic redistribution of actin , with loss of stress fibers and assembly of filaments at the cell periphery , again consistent with constitutive activation of the WRC ( Fig . 3a ) . Interactions of the VCA , and perhaps the structure of the entire meander - VCA element , appear to be highly cooperative , as perturbation of either the V - or C - region contacts produces WRC activity near that of the isolated VCA ( Figs . 2d and e ) . Activation by Rac Rac plays an important role in controlling actin polymerization and lamellipodia formation through activation of the WRC in vivo 8 , 30 , 31 . Rac1 binds to recombinant WRC and activates it in vitro at micromolar concentrations under optimized assay conditions without disrupting the integrity of the complex 13 , 14 ( Supplementary Fig . 12 ) . By analogy to the activation of WASP by Cdc42 4 , we reasoned that removing the VCA from the WRC would increase its affinity for Rac1 . Indeed , in pull down assays immobilized GST - Rac1 : GMPPNP ( a GTP analog ) bound a VCA - deleted WRC ( ΔWRC ) to a greater extent than miniWRC ( Supplementary Fig . 13 ) . Using equilibrium dialysis we measured a dissociation constant ( K D ) of 1 - 2 μM for ΔWRC . MiniWRC bound Rac with lower affinity , having K D of 7 - 10 μM ( Fig . 3b ) . The constitutively active L697D / Y704D Sra1 - miniWRC ( Fig . 3b ) had affinity similar to that of ΔWRC , consistent with notion that sequestration of the VCA motif competes with Rac1 binding . These results imply that Rac1 binds to the body of the WRC competitively with the VCA ( either directly or indirectly ) , leading to activation of the complex . To better define the Rac1 interaction surface , we searched for ΔWRC mutants with defects in Rac1 binding . Examination of the structure of WRC indentified several conserved surface patches . Mutations L697D / Y704D , L841A / F844A / W845A or E250K / Q399A of Sra1 did not perturb the binding of ΔWRC to Rac1 ( data not shown ) . However , Sra1 mutations C179R , R190D , M632D and E434K / F626A , severely impaired binding of ΔWRC to Rac1 without altering the integrity of the recombinant complex ( Fig . 3b and supplementary Fig . 13 ) . These highly conserved Sra1 residues are located in a patch adjacent to α 4 - α 6 of the WAVE1 meander region ( Fig . 3c and supplementary Fig . 14 ) . Furthermore , truncation of α 6 ( Δ154 WAVE1 - WRC ) also decreases Rac1 binding ( Fig . 3c and supplementary Fig . 13 ) , suggesting that the helix or adjacent parts of the meander may contact the bound GTPase directly or stabilize its interaction sites on Sra1 . These data implicate a Rac1 binding site on the WRC involving an Sra1 surface and perhaps part of the meander region of WAVE1 . Interactions of Rac1 could then trigger conformational changes in the meander region and / or its contact site on Sra1 . Since the meander appears to cooperatively stabilize the V - and C - regions of WAVE1 ( see above ) , these perturbations could drive WRC activation by causing release of the VCA . Activation by phosphorylation In cells , phosphorylation of the meander region modulates WRC activity . Several groups report that phosphorylation of the strictly conserved Tyr 150 of WAVE2 ( Tyr 151 in WAVE1 and WAVE3 ) by the Abl kinase is important for WRC - mediated actin assembly Chen et al . Page 5 Nature . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2011 May 25 . A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t and lamellipodia formation 15 - 17 . Additionally , phosphorylation of WAVE Tyr 125 by Src or Thr 138 by Cdk5 , alters cellular actin dynamics 18 , 19 . Tyr 151 of WAVE1 is located in the α 5 - α 6 loop of the meander region , and is buried in a hydrophobic pocket formed by Sra1 and WAVE1 ( Fig . 3c and Supplementary Fig 9 ) . Phosphorylation of Tyr 151 would thus disrupt the contacts between the meander region and Sra1 , leading to destabilization of the C - helix of the VCA motif and WRC activation . To test this idea , we reconstituted a miniWRC containing a phospho - mimicking Y151E mutation in vitro , and generated the analogous full - length WRC in HeLa cells using a knock down / reexpression strategy . Consistent with the structural predictions , the mutant complexes displayed high actin assembly activity both in vivo and in vitro ( Figs . 3a and 3d ) . Mutation of the Y151 - binding pocket in Sra1 ( F686 ESra1 - miniWRC ) equivalently activates the WRC ( Fig . 3d ) . Tyr 125 of WAVE1 is also strictly conserved from animals to plants ( Supplementary Fig . 8 ) . This residue is located in α 3 and its side chain packs against Gln 685 and makes a hydrogen bond to Asp 689 of Sra1 ( Fig 3c and Supplementary Fig . 9 ) . Phosphorylation of Tyr 125 should disrupt the contact with Asp 689 , and could destabilize the meander region of WAVE1 , leading to release of the VCA . Consistent with this , replacement of WAVE2 with a Y124D mutant in cells increased lamellipodia formation ( Fig . 3a ) . Thr 138 of WAVE1 makes intramolecular contacts with α 4 and α 5 ; its hydroxyl group is part of a network of hydrogen bonds that span between these secondary elements ( Fig . 3c and Supplementary Fig . 9 ) . Phosphorylation of Thr 138 may thus also perturb the structure of the meander region , again contributing to activation of the WRC 18 , 19 . Together , the data suggest that , analogous to Rac1 activation , phosphorylation could destabilize the meander region and / or its interactions with Sra1 , leading to release of the VCA and activation of the WRC . Discussion The WRC is typically clustered to high density at its sites of action in cells . This is believed to be necessary for spatially restricted actin assembly during , for example , polarized cell movement 1 . Clustering is mediated by the combined actions of phosphoinositide lipids and Rac , as well as various SH3 containing proteins 1 , 3 . The polybasic region of WAVE2 ( equivalent to residues 172 - 184 of WAVE1 ) can bind phosphoinositide lipids in vitro , and is essential for membrane recruitment of the WRC and formation of lamellipodia in cells 12 . Surface electrostatic calculations show that the face containing the WAVE1 : Abi2 : HSPC300 four - helix bundle is negatively charged ( Fig . 4a ) , while much of the face of the complex adjacent to the polybasic region is positively charged ( Fig . 4b ) . This polar distribution suggests that when the WRC is recruited to the plasma membrane , the side covered by the four - helix bundle is exposed to the cytoplasm , while the opposite side contacts the membrane . In this orientation Rac would bind approximately to the side of the WRC ( Fig . 4c ) , and its C - terminal isoprene group , the polybasic region of WAVE and the basic surface of the Sra1 / Nap1 dimer could all be directed toward the plasma membrane . The meander region and the VCA motif of WAVE would face the cytoplasm , making them accessible to Chen et al . Page 6 Nature . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2011 May 25 . A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t other regulators ( e . g . kinases ) , and to the Arp2 / 3 complex and actin . This organization would allow simultaneous phosphoinositide and Rac binding , cooperatively recruiting the WRC to membranes and enhancing allosteric activation . Self - association of the WRC at membranes 14 , and consequent enhanced activity 5 , could be mediated by inter - complex binding of the N - terminal helix of Sra1 with the WAVE / Abi / HSPC300 trimer , as observed in the crystal lattice ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . Sra1 was recently reported to support translation inhibition through simultaneous binding to the translational regulator , FMRP , and the translation initiation factor , eIF4E 9 , 10 . However , the putative mode of eIF4e binding is incompatible with the WRC structure ( Fig . 1b , Supplementary Fig . 15 ) . Thus , eIF4E may bind to isolated Sra1 , but not the WRC , consistent with the finding that eIF4E co - immunoprecipitates with Sra1 but not WAVE 9 . These observations suggest that Sra1 may partition between the WRC , which regulates actin dynamics , and a free ( or alternatively complexed ) state , which regulates translation . Similar arguments have also been made regarding different pools of Nap1 32 and Abi 33 . Interestingly , defects in Sra1 or its ligands in both pathways—protocadherin - 10 which binds the WRC 34 , and FMRP—are implicated in autism and other mental disorders 35 , 36 , suggesting that an appropriate balance of these pathways or their joint action may be needed for proper neuronal development and function . Future studies of the intact WRC and its separate components will reveal how this system coordinates multiple processes in normal and abnormal cellular function . Methods summary Sra1 , Nap1 , WAVE1 , Abi2 and HSPC300 were overexpressed separately , partially purified , assembled into an Sra1 : Nap1 dimer and a WAVE1 / Abi2 / HSPC300 trimer , respectively , and then assembled into the miniWRC pentamer . Further purification produced homogenous samples . Crystals of miniWRC were obtained by hanging - drop vapor - diffusion at 4 °C . All the data sets were collected at the ID - 19 beamline ( APS , Chicago ) and processed with the HKL3000 suit 37 and CCP4 suites 38 . Experimental phases were determined from Se - MIRAS data collected on samples containing either SeMet - Sra1 or SeMet - Nap1 , and analyzed using ShelxD . Phases were improved using MLPHARE and Parrot . The atomic model of the complex was built using Buccaneer and Coot , and refined using Refmac 5 . Equilibrium dialysis was done at room temperature and protein concentrations were determined using Deep Purple gel staining ( GE Healthcare ) . Actin polymerization and GST - Rac1 pull - down assays were performed as described previously 13 . HeLa cells were grown directly on coverslips , fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde , and prepared for immunofluorescence as described 25 .
