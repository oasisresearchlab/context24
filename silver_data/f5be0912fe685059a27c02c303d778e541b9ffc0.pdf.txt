Main text : The Critical Medical Ecology model is a multidimensional , multilevel way of viewing pandemics comprehensively , rooted simultaneously in microbiology and in anthropology , with shared priority for evolution , context , stressors , homeostasis , adaptation , and power relationships . Viewing COVID - 19 with a Critical Medical Ecological lens suggests three important interpretations : 1 ) COVID - 19 is equally — if not more — a socially - driven disease as much as a biomedical disease , 2 ) the present interventions available for primary prevention of transmission are social and behavioral interventions , and 3 ) wide variation in COVID - 19 hospitalization / death rates is not expected to significantly be attributable to a more virulent and rapidly - evolving virus , but rather to differences in social and behavioral factors — and power dynamics — rather than ( solely ) biological and clinical factors . Cities especially are challenged due to logistics and volume of patients , and lack of access to sustaining products and services for many residents living in isolation . Conclusions : In the end , SARS - CoV - 2 is acting upon dynamic social human beings , entangled within structures and relationships that include but extend far beyond their cells , and in fact beyond their own individual behavior . As a comprehensive way of thinking , the Critical Medical Ecology model helps identify these elements and dynamics in the context of ecological processes that create , shape , and sustain people in their multidimensional , intersecting environments . © The Author ( s ) . 2020 Open Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4 . 0 International License , which permits use , sharing , adaptation , distribution and reproduction in any medium or format , as long as you give appropriate credit to the original author ( s ) and the source , provide a link to the Creative Commons licence , and indicate if changes were made .

Infectious Diseases of Poverty ( 2020 ) 9 : 71 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1186 / s40249 - 020 - 00694 - 3 Background As the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome corona - virus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ; the cause of the coronavirus disease 2019 [ COVID - 19 ] ) is transmitted globally to often devas - tating circumstances for individuals , communities , and countries , researchers seek to identify how to contribute global scientific insights by including this new experience into their research [ 1 , 2 ] . In many ways , researchers have been primed for this moment for quite some time : espe - cially over the past decade , there has been a push to create multi - and cross - disciplinary work , global collaboration , and integrative models to help address complex problems [ 3 ] . Such models can serve as useful heuristic devices that add perspective and points - of - view that contribute to the overall scientific canon aimed at explaining , reducing , and preventing health crises . Practitioners and researchers in the midst of over - whelming COVID - 19 outbreaks are calling for new ways of looking at such pandemics , with an emphasis on hu - man behavior and holistic consideration [ 4 ] . While , in effect , any scientific model could be used to frame SARS - CoV - 2 and COVID - 19 to generate hypotheses and insights , some models are especially well - suited to thinking about pandemics and to expand comprehensive thinking beyond traditional — albeit useful — ways of looking at viral outbreaks . Pandemics are frequently characterized by intense focus on the evolution , trans - mission , survival , and pathogenic impact of the virus it - self — indeed development of treatments and immunizations rely on understanding these biological el - ements . Viral outbreaks , however , are also characterized by more socio - behaviorally - oriented public health efforts aimed at reducing and eliminating exposure to the virus and prevention of morbidity and mortality once infected [ 5 , 6 ] . These public health and behavioral efforts involve different forms of science and points - of - view , generally , than do those efforts attempting to understand the virus ’ natural history . Often missing from scientific thinking around pandemics are the multi - leveled , complex no - tions surrounding social and cultural determinants of health and behavior , which focus beyond the individual and their cells to systematic and structural elements in society that additionally contribute to disease and its spread . Engulfing social determinants are power and economic relationships and processes , at micro and macro levels , that subsequently realign causal attention from individuals as the pandemic ’ s focus of control to larger population aggregations . All of these intersecting dimensions are overlapping , dynamic , and changing . But , whether or not an individual person dies from COVID - 19 relates — in part — to them being exposed in the first place ( a largely social - environmental phenomenon ) , the voracity of the virus pitted against one ’ s cells ( a largely bio - pathogenic process ) , and the ability for that pathogenic process to be interrupted or attenuated ( a mix of social and biological processes , including health care systems and practices ) . The peculiar , intersectional social and biological his - torical circumstances that bring virus and human to - gether are crucial aspects of explaining viral infection in the context of these other dimensions . One especially well - suited paradigm for thinking about SARS - CoV - 2 and COVID - 19 in this manner is the Critical Medical Ecology model [ 7 – 10 ] . Distinct from other ways of inte - grative thinking ( perhaps the Biopsychosocial Model , [ 11 ] or the Social Ecological Model [ 12 ] ) , Critical Med - ical Ecology is a multidimensional , multilevel way of viewing pandemics comprehensively , rooted simultan - eously in microbiology and in anthropology , with shared priority for the processes of evolution , context , unin - tended / unexpected consequences , stressors , homeosta - sis , adaptation , and power relationships — the main components of ecology , with attention to power dynam - ics that have widespread consequence [ 10 ] . The spread and impact of SARS - CoV - 2 / COVID - 19 differentially impacts cities ; in fact , the nodes of the pandemic are cit - ies , which can be viewed as similarly evolving , reacting , and adapting as entities like pathogens and humans [ 13 ] . The Critical Medical Ecology model — with its emphasis on multileveled factors from cell to society and experi - ences across sociocultural , biological , abiotic , and health care domains ( Fig . 1 ) — is well - suited to , therefore , help conceptualize ( as an explanatory model ) or to help plan for ( as a programmatic model ) the factors , domains , and processes that surround SARS - CoV - 2 , COVID - 19 , and urban areas . The virus in ecological context Crucial features of the biology of SARS - CoV - 2 are the central pathogenic stressors in the COVID - 19 experi - ence . Coronaviruses comprise an enveloped , single positive - strand RNA virus with spikes [ 14 ] that are es - sential for viral entry into cells and that enable replica - tion of the single strand RNA via RNA - dependent - RNA polymerase in the infected cytoplasm of the cell [ 14 ] . At least eight strains of SARS - CoV - 2 circulate around the world , giving clues to complex transmission patterns [ 15 ] . For example , the L - type became more prevalent than the S - type strain of SARS - COV - 2 after being de - clared the global pandemic , suggesting that SARS - CoV - 2 virus perhaps evolved and may create different outcomes [ 16 ] . Most COVID - 19 cases are mild or asymptomatic ; those individuals with no symptoms , however , can trans - mit the virus , a key feature of the biology of SARS - CoV - 2 infection [ 17 ] . The peak of viral load concentration is estimated at approximately Day 5 of symptom onset with viral shedding through respiratory droplets or fecal matter . That those infected with SARS - CoV - 2 might be Dye et al . Infectious Diseases of Poverty ( 2020 ) 9 : 71 Page 2 of 7 contagious from a few days before symptoms begin to approximately 20 days after symptoms appear [ 18 ] drives the primary preventive strategy of physical isolation as an attempt to stop or slow community transmission . Transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 arises from the intersec - tion of biology with human behavior , culture , and the abiotic environment . The natural host for SARS - CoV - 2 is likely to be bats . Most coronaviruses are found in re - gions with high diversity of bats , showing that coronaviruses have the capability to inhabit various spe - cies of bats , with high prevalence of host — an import - ant evolutionary factor in emerging infectious disease [ 19 ] . The intermediate host for SARS - CoV - 2 is sus - pected to be pangolin , one of the world ’ s most illegally - trafficked animals and listed on the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( ICUN ) Red List of Threat - ened Species [ 20 ] . While no data of seasonality for coro - naviruses has yet been established , significant difference Fig . 1 Critical Medical Ecological Model Applied to SARS - CoV - 2 infection and COVID - 19 ( adapted from McElfroy and Townsend 2015 ) . SARS - CoV - 2 : Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ; COVID - 19 : Coronavirus disease 2019 ; ACE2 : Angiotensin - converting enzyme 2 Dye et al . Infectious Diseases of Poverty ( 2020 ) 9 : 71 Page 3 of 7 in the growth rate of SARS - CoV - 2 infection exists be - tween cold and warm climates [ 21 ] . Based on the cases from January 22 , 2020 to March 21 , 2020 , there were fewer cases of the virus in warmer climates with more cases of the virus in areas within the range of temperature ( 3 – 17 °C ) and absolute humidity ( 4 to 9 g / m 3 ) [ 21 ] . The transmission rate of SARS - COV - 2 is very high , pos - sibly due to the capability of infection in both upper and lower respiratory systems and through several mecha - nisms of pathogenesis ( e . g . , angiotensin - converting en - zyme 2 [ ACE2 ] , polybasic furin - type cleavage site , and antibody - dependent enhancement ) [ 22 ] . Also , SARS - COV - 2 has higher binding affinity toward ACE2 receptors comparing with SARS - CoV , which suggests that SARS - CoV - 2 is more contagious [ 23 ] . COVID - 19 is more com - mon in people with diseases and behaviors that are strongly sociocultural : immunocompromised individuals , those with pre - existing chronic conditions ( hypertension , diabetes ) , smokers , and elders [ 24 ] . Cities in ecological context Rampant spread of SARS - CoV - 2 infection within and among cities clearly signals that urban areas contain con - ditions favorable for rapid transmission of the virus . As social - environmental entities , cities evolved historically to support the proximity of services and economic specialization required to sustain growing populations and dramatic shifts in agricultural production [ 13 ] . Cities emerged as a new built environment created and shaped by the people within it , and subsequently shaping them in return [ 13 ] . Higher concentrations of people require that cities create institutions and infrastructures supporting education , jobs , housing , healthcare and transportation , all organized around the presumed requirement of serving large volumes of people dependent upon external provision of services . Life in an urban environment pre - sents opportunities for access to technology , employment , and better healthcare , but also exposes limitations , under - scored by living in large , unmanageable , and often inequit - able aggregations of people , frequently in small residences in limited geographical space . While cities typically serve ( or are perceived as serv - ing ) as resource - rich economic , transportation , and cul - tural hubs , the challenges of public health , medical care , and disease in urban areas are accentuated in the global COVID - 19 pandemic . In the absence of a cure or vac - cine against SARS - CoV - 2 , isolation , quarantine , limiting community interaction , providing personal protective equipment for front - line providers , and social - physical distancing are the primary strategies available to inter - rupt or attenuate viral transmission [ 25 ] . The current predictive models for SARS - CoV - 2 infection [ 25 ] and genomic analysis of the virus from different regions of the world [ 15 ] show that travelers from affected areas are the first points of contact for spreading infection be - fore community transmission ensues . Viral transmission is further enabled in cities by the complex interaction of high population density , a heterogenous population , mass public transit systems such as buses and subways , unequal exposure to risk and virus , and also a higher rate of nosocomial transmission through over - crowded hospitals and healthcare facilities [ 26 ] . The current “ shelter in place ” orders issued by governments are an almost unimaginable premise in metropolitan cities in that essential services supply chains ( e . g . , food , protect - ive gear ) can be disrupted or manipulated by differential purchasing power in the face of urban inequality , espe - cially exacerbating the vulnerability of marginalized groups ( including people living with disabilities , immi - grants , and homeless ) who frequently are not able to ad - here to preventative guidelines [ 27 ] . City life and urbanization therefore present a unique challenge for global pandemic containment , as viruses are likely to arrive in cities first due to their global con - nectivity , and are more likely to thrive in their complex artificial ecosystems . Cities are the first and most sub - stantial abiotic environments where SARS - CoV - 2 arises , with public areas , bars , schools , hospitals , and work - places providing ideal conditions for the virus to spread [ 28 ] . While access to enhanced technology and resources potentially allows for expedited short - term adaptation of people and systems , inequities bar many from penetrat - ing basic health , social , and sustenance services as urban systems quickly become overwhelmed by the large vol - ume of people in need . Health care in ecological context Health , medical , and healing systems are especially rele - vant cultural adaptations that have evolved over time ; an evolution that was , in fact , often in tandem with human cultural responses to infectious disease [ 29 ] . Reduction in the morbidity and mortality from SARS - CoV - 2 infec - tion requires a prevention system sensitive to the bio - logical features of the virus previously described , in particular its easily aerosolized transmissibility , conta - gious symptomatic and asymptomatic carriers , and , in some , rapid progression from symptoms to systemic medical crisis . No curative treatment ( tertiary preven - tion ) exists for COVID - 19 , underscoring the need for screening and primary / secondary prevention with subse - quent public health intervention . Identifying SARS - CoV - 2 infection comprises symptomatic screening , testing for presence of viral DNA ( PCR ) , or a serological test for presence of viral antibodies . Given the large burden of COVID - 19 attributable to viral transmission by asymp - tomatic carriers , widespread testing and subsequent quarantine of those found positive is necessary to Dye et al . Infectious Diseases of Poverty ( 2020 ) 9 : 71 Page 4 of 7 interrupt transmission of infection . Major challenges to symptomatic screening for COVID - 19 are the ambigu - ities and similarities of symptoms compared to the com - mon cold or influenza [ 30 ] . Widespread and timely testing varies greatly from country to country , and in the USA especially ( where testing policy is not regulated na - tionally , and instead becomes the responsibility of local entities ) , from community to community local officials compete with others within their own state and across states to access supplies through undisclosed sources [ 31 ] . The centralized push for testing in the USA by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was mired in bureaucracy , manufacturing issues , quality control , and scientific standard delays [ 32 ] . WHO shipped 250 000 diagnostic tests to 70 laboratories around the world while the US efforts in developing testing lagged behind [ 33 ] . Republic of Korea was able to offer testing kits after China shared the genomic sequence with the public and emergency approval was granted on a temporary basis [ 34 ] . The medical teams of Korea were able to screen patients with suspected respiratory symptoms in a time - efficient manner by donning one quarantine suit in “ drive - through centers ” that minimized contact between health care workers and patients [ 34 ] . Because of the voracity and lack of experience with SARS - CoV - 2 , treatments are taking time to emerge and best - practice remains unclear . The multipronged ap - proach to treatment includes development of pharmaceut - ical regimens , and ( for the most severely impacted patients ) the use of life - saving equipment ( such as ventila - tors ) to treat symptoms , all requiring rapid expansion in hospital beds and capacity . Social - physical distancing are the primary strategies available to interrupt or attenuate viral transmission [ 35 ] , and some of preventive measures ( such as hand hygiene or wearing a face mask ) were found to reduce levels of psychological impact during COVID - 19 outbreak and peak of the epidemics [ 35 , 36 ] . Finally , providing protective gear and preventive pol - icies for the healthcare workforce — among those at greatest risk for SARS - CoV - 2 infection — has lagged be - hind the rapidly rising numbers of cases of COVID - 19 cases and raised the stress levels of healthcare workers [ 37 ] . Delays in production and deployment of life - saving equipment for patients and care providers have been in - fluenced by political and economic priorities well - beyond the patient - provider interface and the institu - tions where these activities occur [ 38 – 40 ] . Conclusions Viewing COVID - 19 with a Critical Medical Ecological lens suggests three important interpretations : 1 ) COVID - 19 is equally — if not more — a socially - driven disease as much as a biomedical disease , 2 ) the present interventions available for primary prevention of transmission are social and behavioral interventions , and 3 ) power dynamics and political relationships well be - yond the level of the individual likely determine , at least in part , the risk that a person will become infected . Hu - man sociocultural factors ( e . g . , consumption of pango - lins , travel exposures , face - to - face interaction ) and socially - involved predisposing conditions ( hypertension , diabetes , smoking ) provide a platform for this virus to spread . Many — if not most — deadly viruses circulating throughout the world arose from the human - animal interface , challenging agricultural and dietary practice , disease effects of modernity , and culture . Class privilege contributes to some groups willfully disregarding social - physical distancing orders while disadvantaging others who serve them in restaurants , stores , and delivery ser - vices . The healthcare workforce at the forefront of caring for those infected are at - risk for contracting SARS - CoV - 2 because of shortages of personal protective equipment ( attributable to differential access to supply chain by many actors ) as are workers considered “ essential ” throughout the service industy similarly without access to protective gear [ 41 ] . Patients are differentially disad - vantaged by lack of universal screening and testing pol - icies and the supply chain of tests to support them , combined with unequal access to equipment to treat the most serious cases . Supply chains across the spectrum of testing and treatment are subject to competition and pri - vileged access depending on political and economic rela - tionships . Cities especially are challenged due to logistics and volume of patients , and lack of access to sustaining products and services for many residents living in isola - tion . What happens to people is largely a function of who and where they are . Wide variation in hospitalization rates and death rates from COVID - 19 are not expected to be attributable significantly to a more virulent and rapidly - evolving virus , but to social and be - havioral factors — and power dynamics — rather than ( solely ) biological and clinical factors . In the end , SARS - CoV - 2 is acting upon dynamic social human beings , entangled within structures and relationships that in - clude but extend far beyond their cells , and in fact be - yond their own individual behavior . As a comprehensive way of thinking , the Critical Medical Ecology model helps identify these elements and intersections in the context of ecological processes that create , shape , and sustain people in their multidimensional , intersecting environments .
