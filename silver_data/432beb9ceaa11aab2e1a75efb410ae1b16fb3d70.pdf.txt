Using a high - speed charge - coupled device camera , we measure the ﬂow speed , cell deformation , and entry time into the constrictions of several hundred cells per minute during their passage through the device . From the ﬂow speed and the occupation state of the microconstriction array with cells , the driving pressure across each constriction is continuously computed . Cell entry times into microconstrictions decrease with increased driving pres - sure and decreased cell size according to a power law . From this power - law relationship , the cell elasticity and ﬂuidity can be estimated . When cells are treated with drugs that depolymerize or stabilize the cytoskeleton or the nucleus , elasticity and ﬂuidity data from all treatments collapse onto a master curve . Power - law rheology and collapse onto a master curve are predicted by the theory of soft glassy materials and have been previously shown to describe the mechanical behavior of cells adhering to a sub - strate . Our ﬁnding that this theory also applies to cells in suspension provides the foundation for a quantitative high - throughput measurement of cell mechanical properties with microﬂuidic devices . INTRODUCTION Mechanical properties of living cells are important for essential cell functions including cell contraction ( 1 , 2 ) , crawling and invasion ( 3 ) , differentiation ( 4 – 6 ) , and wound healing and division ( 7 , 8 ) . Moreover , alterations of cell mechanical properties have been linked to common human diseases such as cancer ( 9 , 10 ) , inﬂammation and sepsis ( 11 ) , asthma ( 2 ) , malaria ( 10 , 12 ) , and cardiovascular disorders . To measure cell mechanical properties , numerous tech - niques have been developed including atomic force microscopy ( 13 ) , micropipette aspiration ( 14 , 15 ) , particle tracking microrheology ( 16 ) , and magnetic tweezer micro - rheology ( 17 ) . However , these techniques suffer from low measurement throughput of ~ 10 – 100 cells / h . By contrast , microﬂuidic technologies can achieve a much higher throughput , for example by shear ﬂow stretching ( 18 , 19 ) or by measuring the entry or transit time of cells through micronscale constrictions ( microconstrictions ) . Such micro - constriction setups have been used to investigate suspended erythrocytes ( 20 ) , leukocytes ( 11 ) , neutrophils ( 21 ) , and invasive and noninvasive cancer cell lines ( 22 – 24 ) . Although the cell entry time into microconstrictions corre - lates with cell stiffness and viscosity , it also depends on the externally applied pressure , cell size , and friction be - tween the cell and the channel walls ( 25 ) . Therefore , we believe that quantitative measurements of cell mechanical properties have thus far not been achieved with such setups . In this article , we describe a quantitative , high - throughput method to measure the mechanical properties of cells in sus - pension ( suspended cells or adherent cells that have been detached and brought in suspension ) with a parallel micro - constriction device . We use constrictions that are smaller than the nucleus of the cell and therefore deform and probe both the nucleus and the cytoskeleton , resulting in a bulk measurement of the whole cell . Our approach is to measure for each cell and each microconstriction not only the entry time , but also the cell size and the applied pressure . Using a high - speed charge - coupled device camera in combination with automated image analysis , we achieve a throughput of ~ 10 , 000 cells / h . We ﬁnd that the relationship among entry time , cell defor - mation , and driving pressure conforms to power - law rheology . Power - law rheology describes the mechanical properties of cells with only two parameters : cell elasticity ( stiffness ) and cell ﬂuidity ( the power - law exponent ) . More - over , we ﬁnd that elasticity and ﬂuidity data from cells treated with a wide range of chemicals that alter the cyto - skeletal ( actin , microtubule ) or the nuclear structure ( chro - matin packing ) all collapse onto a master curve . This master curve establishes that the mechanical properties of cells in suspension are governed by only a single param - eter , namely cell ﬂuidity . Therefore , with only a single Submitted March 2 , 2015 , and accepted for publication May 26 , 2015 . * Correspondence : bfabry @ biomed . uni - erlangen . de Graeme Whyte and Ben Fabry contributed equally to this work .

MATERIALS AND METHODS Design of the device The microﬂuidic device consists of eight parallel constrictions connected to a single inlet and outlet with a low - resistance pressure - equalizing bypass , similar to previously published designs ( 11 , 21 ) ( Fig . 1 a ) . Cells in suspension ﬁrst have to pass through a ﬁlter mesh before the ﬂow is divided into eight parallel constriction branches . The height of the device is chosen to be in the range of the cell diameter ( 17 m m for K562 cells ) . The width and height of the constrictions are chosen to be smaller than the nuclear diameter . For the K562 leukemia cells used in this study , we empirically ﬁnd a good compromise between high throughput ( wide con - strictions ) and high sensitivity ( narrow constrictions ) for a constriction width of 5 m m and a height of 9 m m ( Fig . S1 a in the Supporting Ma - terial ) . With these dimensions , an average entry time between 5 and 1000 ms can be achieved . The length and shape of the constriction ( Fig . 1 , b and d ) is chosen so that the passage time is dominated by the time the cell needs to deform to the width of the channel . Once fully deformed , the cell slides through the constriction channel in < 1 . 4 ms , which is the temporal resolution of the camera . Therefore , cell friction at the constriction walls can be neglected . The microﬂuidic device is mounted on a glass coverslip and imaged from below using an inverted microscope . Devices are fabricated using standard PDMS molding techniques from a photolithographically developed SU8 master . Brieﬂy , SU8 - 2025 Photore - sist ( MicroChem , Westborough , MA ) is spin - coated onto 3 00 Si wafers ( Sil - icon Materials , Pittsburgh , PA ) to form layers of 17 m m height . Due to light diffraction during ultraviolet exposure of the Photoresist through a chrome mask , the constrictions have a decreased height of 9 m m ( Fig . S1 a ) . Devices are produced from a 10 : 1 ratio of elastomer / curing agent ( Sylgard 184 ; Dow Corning , Midland , MI ) , which is mixed and poured onto the SU8 master . After baking for at least 2 h at 65 (cid:2) C , the device is peeled from the SU8 , plasma - bonded to a microscope coverslip using air plasma gener - ated by a plasma oxidizer ( Zepto ; Diener Electronic , Nagold , Germany ) , and further baked for 1 h at 65 (cid:2) C . Cell culture K562 cells ( No . CCL - 243 ; American Type Culture Collection , Manassas , VA ) are cultured at 37 (cid:2) C and 5 % CO 2 in Iscove’s modiﬁed Dulbecco’s me - dium ( IMDM , Gibco Cat . No . 12440053 ; Life Technologies / Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc , Waltham , MA ) containing 10 % FCS ( fetal calf serum , Gibco , Cat . No . 16000 - 036 ) and 1 % PSG ( Penicillin - Streptomycin - Glutamine , Gibco Cat . No . 10378 - 016 ) . MDA - MB - 231 cells ( No . HTB - 26 ; American Type Culture Collection ) , U2OS cells ( No . CRL - 1573 ; American Type Cul - ture Collection ) , and HEK293T cells ( No . ACS - 4500 ; American Type Cul - ture Collection ) are cultured in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle Medium ( Gibco Cat . No . 11960044 ) , also containing 10 % FCS and 1 % PSG . Cells are passaged every third day . Nuclear staining is performed with DRAQ5 ( Cat . No . ab108410 ; Abcam , Cambridge , MA ) according to the manufac - turer’s guidelines . Whole cell staining for size measurements is performed with calcein ( Cat . No . C0875 ; Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) . Life - death staining is performed with calcein and propidium iodide ( Cat . No . P4170 ; Sigma - Aldrich ) . Transfection For the generation of K562 and MDA - MB - 231 cells expressing eGFP - lamin A , we use lentiviral transduction . For producing lentiviral particles , HEK293T cells are cotransfected with the vectors pMD2 . G , psPAX2 , and pLVX containing the coding sequence of lamin A N - terminally fused to eGFP using lipofectamine LTX ( Gibco Cat . No . 15338100 ) . The cell cul - ture supernatant is collected daily and replaced with fresh Dulbecco’s modi - ﬁed Eagle’s medium for the next four days . The collected medium containing assembled virus particles is pooled and ﬁltered through 0 . 45 m m pores , supplemented with 8 m g / mL polybrene ( Cat . No . 107689 ; Sigma - Aldrich ) and added to K562 and MDA - MB - 2331 cells for 18 h . Starting from Day 2 after lentiviral infection , cells are selected using 2 . 5 m g / mL puromycin . After 10 days , eGFP - lamin A - expressing K562 cells are sorted using a MoFlo Legacy cell sorter ( Dako Cytomation , Carpinteria , CA ) . For the generation of U2OS cells stably expressing the ﬂuorescent F - actin marker LifeAct - TagGFP2 , we transfect the expression vector using lipofectamine LTX ( Gibco Cat . No . 15338100 ) according to the manufac - turer’s instructions . Starting from Day 2 after transfection , stably expressing cells are selected using 1 mg / mL G418 ( Cat . No . 83768 ; FIGURE 1 ( a ) Schematic of the microﬂuidic de - vice with inlet , debris ﬁlter , constriction area sur - rounded by a bypass , and outlet .

The ﬁgure depicts three examples of how the pressure across the leftmost constriction ( color - coded in saturated colors ) changes when cells block the ﬂuid ﬂow through neighboring constrictions ( the pressure in the remaining system is color - coded in light colors ) . The 256 different combinations of blocked and free micro - constrictions give rise to six possible pressure drop combinations that can differ by up to a factor of 2 .

These cells are used only for visualizing the cell entry with confocal microscopy ( Fig . 1 b ) , but not for evaluation of mechanical properties . Drug treatments To condense nuclear chromatin , K562 cells are treated for 30 min with Ca 2 þ ions ( 2 mM , C8106 ; Sigma - Aldrich ) and Mg 2 þ ions ( 2 mM , Cat . No . 2444 - 05 ; J . T . Baker , Center Valley , PA ) . To decondense the chromatin , cells are treated for 3 h with 5 m M 5 - AZA - 2 0 - deoxycytidine ( Cat . No . A3656 ; Sigma - Aldrich ) . To inhibit actin polymerization at the barbed end , cells are treated for 30 min with 10 m M cytochalasin D ( Cat . No . C8273 ; Sigma - Aldrich ) . To permanently cross - link cell components , cells are treated for 30 min with 500 m M glutaraldehyde ( Cat . No . G5882 ; Sigma - Aldrich ) . To inhibit microtubule polymerization , cells are treated for 3 h with 500 nM nocodazole ( Cat . No . M1404 ; Sigma - Aldrich ) . To inhibit microtubule depolymerization , cells are treated for 1 h with 5 m M paclitaxel ( Cat . No . T7191 ; Sigma - Aldrich ) . To agglomerate the vimentin and keratin intermediate ﬁlament network , cells are treated for 3 h with 5 mM acryl - amide ( Cat . No . A8887 ; Sigma - Aldrich ) . All drug concentrations are main - tained during measurements . Cell size and viability remain unchanged after drug treatment ( Fig . S2 , a and b ) , conﬁrming that mechanical responses are not biased by dead or damaged cells . Device operation Flowthroughthedeviceiscreatedbyapplyingahydrostaticpressure . Before measurements , the device is ﬂushed using an air - over - liquid pump ( Bello - fram , Newell , WV ) with pressures ranging between 2 and 50 kPa . Microﬂuidic ﬂow during measurements is manually adjusted for optimal throughput between 0 . 1 and 3 kPa by lifting or lowering the cell reservoir connected to the device inlet . Rigid polyether - ether - ketone tubing ( PEEK tubing ; VWR , Radnor , PA ) isusedtoconnectthecellreservoirtothedevice . Before measurements , the device is ﬁlled with PBS ( phosphate - buffered saline , Gibco Cat . No . 10010 ) containing 1 % Pluronic ( BASF , Ludwigsha - fen , Germany ; Cat . No . P2443 , Sigma - Aldrich ) to coat the surfaces of the PDMS and reduce unspeciﬁc cell and protein adhesion to the surfaces of the device . The cell suspension ( 100 , 000 cells in 1 mL of medium with 1 % Pluronic ; BASF ) is ﬂushed into the device , and the entry of the cells into the constric - tions is monitored using either a high - speed charge - coupled device camera operated at a frame rate of 700 fps ( model No . GE480 ; Allied Vision Tech - nologies , Stadtroda , Germany ) , or a laser - scanning confocal microscope ( SP5 ; Leica Microsystems , Wetzlar , Germany ) ( Fig . 1 , b and d ) . Video se - quences are recorded for further analysis with the software MATLAB ( The MathWorks , Natick , MA ) . Weverifythatincubatingthecellswith1 % Pluronic ( BASF ) foruptofour days does not change cell viability and proliferation rate ( Fig . S2 c ) . Impor - tantly , the exposure of the cells to shear forces during their passage through the microconstriction device does not impair cell viability or cell growth ( Fig . S2 c ) . These results suggest that our device is also suitable for repeated measurements of the same cell population over longer time periods . Measurement of cell deformation , cell speed , and entry time Before the cell enters the constriction , we record and analyze between three and ﬁve images of the undeformed cell , depending on the ﬂow rate ( Fig . 1 d ) . Bright - ﬁeld images are background - subtracted , Sobel - ﬁltered for edge detection , and the outline of the cell is segmented by thresholding . For quantifying the cell radius R , a circle is ﬁtted to the cell contour . The change in the position of the circle over subsequent images is used to compute the cell speed . Cell entry time t entry into the constriction is measured by monitoring brightness changes ( SD ) within a region of interest ( ROI ) at the opening of the microconstriction ( Fig . 1 c ) . The SD of bright - ness intensities within the ROI increases sharply ( within one frame ) when a cell enters the constriction , and drops equally sharply when it leaves the constriction ( Fig . 1 , b and c ) . An empirical threshold ( constant for all exper - iments ) is applied to deﬁne the beginning and end of the entry . To quantify the maximum cell deformation ε max during the cell’s entry into the micro - constrictions , we consider the cell as being incompressible during the relatively short entry time . Further , we approximate the stress as a simple one - dimensional compression . The maximum strain of the cell is calculated from the relative difference between its uncompressed radius R and the effective radius of the microconstriction R eff , which is the radius of a circle with the same cross - section area ( R eff ¼ ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ h , w = p p ¼ 3 : 8 m m , Fig . S1 a ) , ε max ¼ R (cid:3) R eff R ; ( 1 ) for R > R eff . We conﬁrm that the dimensions of the constrictions remain con - stant for the pressure range applied in this study ( 1 – 10 kPa ) ( Fig . S1 b ) . Pressure calculation To calculate cell mechanical properties , the applied pressure across the constriction needs to be known . Due to the ﬁnite resistance of the microﬂui - dic channels , however , the hydrostatic pressure is not constant throughout the device . Moreover , the pressure ﬂuctuates on long and short timescales when parts of the inlet and outlet channel system or the microconstrictions themselves are blocked by cells . Therefore , the pressure across each indi - vidual microchannel is calculated continuously . To do so , we track the movement of each cell before it enters a microconstriction ( Fig . 1 d ) . To relate the cell speed to the average ﬂow speed , in a preliminary study we reconstructed the ﬂow proﬁle in the channels by measuring the speed of spherical beads ( diameter ¼ 1 m m ) suspended in the medium together with cells ( Fig . S3 a ) . At the same time , we measured the speed of the sus - pended cells and found that it was systematically lower than the average ﬂow speed . Furthermore , the relative cell speed decreased slightly with increasing cell size ( Fig . S3 b ) , as has been previously reported in Hetsroni et al . ( 26 ) and Belloul et al . ( 27 ) . For all subsequent experiments , we compute the average ﬂow speed v avg from the measured cell speed v cell ac - cording to v avg ¼ v cell = ð 1 : 70 (cid:3) 0 : 65 ð r cell = r hyd ð channel Þ ÞÞ ( Fig . S3 b ) , where the hydrodynamic radius of the channel of width w and height h is r hyd ð channel Þ ¼ ð h (cid:4) w Þ = ð h þ w Þ . Because the cells occupy most of the chan - nel cross section ( r cell = r hyd ð channel Þ ~ 0 . 9 ) , cells move along the center of the channel with a SD of 5 1 . 49 m m . We ﬁnd experimentally that errors in calculating v avg from off - centered cells are negligibly small ( data not shown ) . The ﬂow rate can then be calculated as v avg times the cross - sectional area of the channel . From the ﬂow rate , we calculate the pressure drop D p across that particular microconstriction from Hagen - Poiseuille’s law for rectan - gular channels . The pressure across the microconstrictions in each of the other seven segments is then computed according to Kirchhoff’s laws . When a cell blocks a microconstriction , the ﬂow in that particular segment is taken as zero , and the pressure in all other segments is updated depending on their cell occupancy . From the speed of the next cell that is tracked before it enters a microconstriction , we verify the pressure from the previous update and ﬁnd for a mean pressure of 400 Pa a small error of (cid:3) 0 . 12 5 9 Pa ( mean 5 SD ) , which arises when one of the cells has not completely blocked a microconstriction , or when a larger cell cluster has partially blocked the inlet ﬁlter between the pressure updates . We then compute the mean pressure that each cell experiences during its entry , D p ¼ 1 = t entry R D p ð t Þ dt . Using the mean pressure instead of the exact time course of the ﬂuctuating pressure across the microconstrictions ( Fig . 1 e ) introduces a negligible error for the subsequent analysis of cell mechanical properties ( Fig . S4 , a – d ) . Biophysical Journal 109 ( 1 ) 26 – 34 28 Lange et al . Calculation of cell mechanical properties The pressure applied to a cell in a microconstriction deforms the cell over time . We treat the cell as a visco - elastic homogeneous body and apply power - law rheology ( 28 ) to describe changes in cell strain ε over time , t : ε ¼ D p E (cid:3) t t 0 (cid:4) b : ( 2 ) Here , E is the cell’s stiffness ( elastic modulus ) evaluated at t 0 ¼ 1 s , a commonly used arbitrary choice . The power - law exponent b reﬂects the mechanical stress dissipation in the cell . A power - law exponent of b ¼ 0 is indicative of a purely elastic solid , and b ¼ 1 is indicative of a purely viscous ﬂuid . In cells , the power - law exponent usually falls in the range be - tween 0 . 1 and 0 . 5 , whereby higher values have been linked to a higher turn - over rate of cytoskeletal structures ( 29 ) . Therefore , in the following we refer to the power - law exponent also as cell ﬂuidity . When the cell is deformed to the size of the microconstriction so that ε ¼ ε max , it is ﬂushed out . The total entry time t entry is thus t entry ¼ (cid:3) ε max E D p (cid:4) 1 b : ( 3 ) Statistical analysis We ﬁt Eq . 3 with the ﬁt parameters E and b to the measured data ( t entry , ε max , and D p ) from several hundreds or thousands of cells . Thus , E and b are average values representative for the whole cell population . Before ﬁtting Eq . 3 to the data with a bivariate error weighting using a Levenberg - Marquardt algorithm implemented in the software MATLAB , the data are logarithmically transformed to obtain a linear relationship between log ð t entry Þ and log ð ε max = D p Þ . SDs of the ﬁt parameters are calculated by bootstrapping , where we repeat the ﬁt on ensembles of randomly selected cells . Comparisons between different pharmacological treatments are per - formed using Student’s t - test . Differences are considered statistically signif - icant for p < 0 . 05 . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Entry time into microconstrictions With a high - speed camera , we record the movement of the cells as they pass through the microconstrictions . For each cell , we compute the cell radius R before it enters the chan - nel , the average pressure difference D p across the microcon - striction during cell entry , and the entry time t entry for entering into the constriction . The cell entry time tends to decrease with increasing pres - sure across the microconstriction ( Fig . 2 a ) . The data of several thousand cells , after binning and averaging , show an inverse power - law relationship between t entry and D p ac - cording to t entry (cid:5) D p (cid:3) 1 = b ( Fig . 2 a ; Fig . S5 a ) . Moreover , when we select cells that are measured over a narrow pres - sure range and plot the entry time versus the maximum cell deformation in the microconstriction ( ε max ) ( Fig . 2 b ; Fig . S5 b ) , we ﬁnd a power - law relationship with the same exponent according to t trans (cid:5) ε 1 = b max . Taking the power - law relationships for t entry together , the entry time depends on both ε max and D p , according to t entry ¼ ð ε max E = D p Þ 1 = b ( Eq . 3 ) with the cell’s elastic modulus E ( evaluated at t ¼ 1 s ) and ﬂuidity b . Inﬂuence of cytoskeletal and nuclear structures on cell mechanical properties With our setup , we measure a stiffness of 296 Pa for K562 leukemia cells under control conditions . This value is in good agreement with previously published data ( see Con - clusions ) . We then treat K562 cells with a series of chemi - cals that are widely known to affect the deformability of cytoskeletal or nuclear structures . Cell stiffness has been shown to be mainly determined by the concentration and mechanical tension of polymerized actin ( 30 – 33 ) . In agree - ment with other articles , we ﬁnd that the disassembly of ﬁla - mentous actin after treatment with cytochalasin D results in a dramatic decrease of cell stiffness by > 50 % ( 3 , 4 , 34 ) . Simultaneously , cell ﬂuidity increases , as seen by the 29 % increase of the power - law exponent ( Fig . 3 , a and b ) . The opposite effect is observed after treating the cells with glutaraldehyde , which indiscriminately cross - links cyto - skeletal and other cellular components and thereby stiffens the whole cell ( 34 ) . Cell stiffness increases by 135 % , and ﬂuidity decreases by ~ 40 % ( Fig . 3 , a and b ) . Similar but smaller effects are expected from chemically altering the microtubule network of the cells ( 5 , 33 ) . Depolymerization with nocodazole decreases cell stiffness by 10 % , and de - creases ﬂuidity slightly but not signiﬁcantly ( p ¼ 0 . 22 ) . Sta - bilization of the microtubule network with paclitaxel has the opposite effect : cell stiffness increases by 18 % , and cell ﬂuidity decreases by 29 % ( Fig . 3 , a and b ) . Compared to changes induced by altering actin polymerization , however , FIGURE 2 Mechanical properties of K562 leukemia cells : entry time - scales with applied pressure and maximum cell deformation according to a power law . ( a ) Scatter plot of entry time versus pressure data for a typical experiment .

Biophysical Journal 109 ( 1 ) 26 – 34 Quantitative Measurements of Cell Mechanics 29 these changes are considerably smaller , demonstrating that the microtubule network is of only minor importance for the deformability of K562 leukemia cells for strains be - tween 0 : 3 % ε max % 0 : 7 and on timescales between 5 ms and 10 s . Disrupting the intermediate ﬁlaments vimentin and keratin by acrylamide ( 33 , 35 – 37 ) induces no signiﬁcant changes in cell stiffness and only decreases cell ﬂuidity by 13 % ( Fig . 3 , a and b ) , demonstrating that the intermediate ﬁlament network is not important for the overall deformabil - ity of K562 cells for the strain and timescales investigated in this study . To determine if the cell entry into microconstrictions is sensitive to changes in the mechanical properties of the nu - cleus , cells are treated with Ca 2 þ and Mg 2 þ divalent cations , which condense the nucleus ( 38 ) . This results in an increase of cell stiffness by 13 % and a decrease of ﬂuidity by 21 % . Conversely , treating the cells with AZA ( 5 - AZA - 2 0 - deoxycy - todine ) , which decondenses the nucleus ( 38 , 39 ) , results in a decrease of cell stiffness by 30 % and an increase of ﬂuidity also by 21 % ( Fig . 3 , a and b ) . Quantitative values of cell stiff - ness and ﬂuidity for all treatments are given in Fig . 3 b . Inﬂuence of the nuclear envelope on cell mechanical properties The dominant intermediate ﬁlament protein of the nuclear envelope , lamin A / C , has been shown to inﬂuence the cells’ entry time through microconstrictions ( 21 ) and to contribute to the stiffness of the nucleus ( 40 , 41 ) . To test the inﬂuence of lamin A - overexpression on overall cell mechanical prop - erties , we measure the stiffness and ﬂuidity of cells overex - pressing GFP - lamin A . Compared to wild - type cells , the stiffness of lamin A - overexpressing cells increases by 38 % ( Fig . 4 , a and b ) , and this is accompanied by a decrease of the power - law exponent by 33 % ( Fig . 4 , a and b ) . Thus , our data conﬁrm that lamin A contributes greatly to cell stiffness , but because our method does not discriminate between the stiffness of the cell nucleus and that of the FIGURE 3 Change in stiffness and ﬂuidity of K562 leukemia cells after drug treatment .

K562 cells are nonadherent and can be permanently cultured in a suspended state . To test our method on normally adherent cells , we overexpress lamin A in MDA - MB - 231 breast carcinoma cells and measure the resulting mechanical changes ( Fig . S6 ) . MDA - MB - 231 cells also show power - law behavior and a similar increase in stiffness and reduction in the power - law exponent after lamin A - overexpression . These data demonstrate that our method is also suitable for measuring normally adherent cell populations . Nonlinear mechanical properties of cells The relatively large mechanical pressure ( 100 – 800 Pa ) and strain ( 0 : 3 % ε max % 0 : 7 ) acting on the cells during their en - try into microconstrictions can potentially lead to an in - crease in stiffness , to an increase of the power - law exponent ( ﬂuidization ) , or both ( 42 , 43 ) . To test if cell me - chanical properties depend on the applied pressure , we bin the measured data into three pressure groups with equal number of cells in each bin , and calculate the mean cell stiff - ness E and the mean power - law exponent b for the cells in these bins separately . We ﬁnd no systematic change of the power - law exponent with the applied pressure ( Fig . S5 d ) . By contrast , we do ﬁnd a small systematic increase in cell stiffness with increasing pressure , with a Pearson correlation coefﬁcient of r ¼ 0 . 60 ( Fig . S5 c ) . To test if cell mechanical properties depend on the maximum strain , we bin the measured data into three strain groups and calculate E and b for the cells in these bins sepa - rately . We ﬁnd a systematic strain stiffening , with a Pearson correlation coefﬁcient of r ¼ 0 . 90 ( Fig . S5 e ) and a slight , systematic change in the power - law exponent b with strain ( r ¼ (cid:3) 0 . 25 ) ( Fig . S5 f ) . Despite a statistically signiﬁcant strain stiffening , these ef - fects are relatively small . We ﬁnd a substantial increase of E with pressure or strain only for glutaraldehyde - treated cells . Therefore , the approximation of pressure - and strain - inde - pendent cell mechanical properties is well justiﬁed by the simplicity and robustness of the data analysis that it affords . Collapse of cell mechanical parameters For all treatment conditions , we ﬁnd an inverse relationship between cell stiffness E and the power - law exponent b ( Fig . 5 a ) . Treatments that increase cell ﬂuidity cause the stiffness to decrease , and vice versa . When the logarithm of E for different treatment conditions is plotted versus the power - law exponent b , all data points collapse onto a line . This relationship thus represents a master curve in that a single parameter , b , deﬁnes the elastic and dissipative behavior of K562 leukemia cells for different manipulations of cytoskeletal or nuclear cell components . The presence of such a master curve has been previously identiﬁed in a variety of adherent cells measured with different deformation methods ( 1 , 29 , 44 , 45 ) . Here , we show that the same collapse of cell mechanics onto a master rela - tionship also holds for suspended cells . Collapse of cell me - chanical data onto a master curve , together with power - law behavior of cell deformations in response to stepwise - increasing mechanical stress , has been interpreted as a signa - ture of soft glassy rheology ( 29 , 46 ) . Accordingly , the power - law exponent describing the cell ﬂuidity can be understood as an effective temperature that controls the dynamics of the mechanically active cell components such as actin , microtu - bules , or motor proteins . In the living cell , these components undergo transient binding interactions with a complex bind - ing energy landscape . Hence , the effective temperature de - scribes the degree of molecular agitation within this energy landscape . When the effective temperature is increased ( high b ) e . g . , by cytochalasin D treatment , the binding inter - actions between cell components become less stable , and the cell softens and ﬂuidizes . By contrast , when the effective temperature is decreased ( low b ) , e . g . , by crosslinking with glutaraldehyde , the binding interactions between cell com - ponents become more stable , and the cell stiffens and exhibits more solidlike characteristics ( Fig . 5 a ) . Mechanical properties of single cells Thus far , we have measured an average stiffness and ﬂuidity of a population of cells under a given condition . Because cell mechanical properties are described by two possibly in - dependent parameters , E and b , we need to perform at least two independent measurements on the same cell , e . g . , at two different pressure values , to extract stiffness and ﬂuidity values for each individual cell . However , as we have demon - strated above , E and b are not independent . Rather , the me - chanical properties of a cell depend only on cell ﬂuidity b , from which the cell stiffness follows as E ¼ E 0 exp ð a b Þ .

Biophysical Journal 109 ( 1 ) 26 – 34 Quantitative Measurements of Cell Mechanics 31 The parameter a sets the slope of the E - versus - b curve and describes how quickly the cell exhibits a melting - type behavior when the ﬂuidity b increases . The parameter E 0 is the intercept of the curve at the glass transition ( b ¼ 0 ) and describes the maximum stiffness of the cell that cannot be exceeded by further cross linking ( 29 ) . For K562 cells , we ﬁnd a ¼ (cid:3) 2 . 51 , and E 0 ¼ 1189 Pa . Assuming that the same relationship holds not only for the cell population but for every cell , as was shown experi - mentally by atomic - force microscopy ( AFM ) measurements of adherent ﬁbroblasts ( 44 ) , we can estimate the mechanical properties of an individual cell from a single measurement of D p , t entry , and ε max : b ¼ ln (cid:3) D p E 0 ε max (cid:4) a (cid:3) ln (cid:5) t entry (cid:6) : ( 4 ) Thus , it is possible to describe the mechanical behavior of individual cells and to analyze the distribution of b within a cell population ( Fig . 5 b ) . We ﬁnd that the ﬂuidity of indi - vidual K562 cells under control conditions follows a normal distribution with a SD of 0 . 12 centered at b ¼ 0 : 31 . This is consistent with previous reports of a normal distribution of cell ﬂuidity in populations of adherent cells ( 2 , 44 , 47 ) . For cells treated with glutaraldehyde , the b - distribution shifts to smaller values with a smaller SD at b ¼ 0 : 17 5 0 : 04 . By contrast , in cells treated with cytochalasin D , both the average ﬂuidity and its SD are increased to b ¼ 0 : 45 5 0 : 15 ( Fig . 5 b ) . CONCLUSIONS In this study , we measure the mechanical properties of cells in suspension using a microconstriction array . We demon - strate that measurements with this microconstriction array are highly sensitive to changes in subcellular properties induced by a range of treatments that act on the cytoskeleton or the nucleus . Mechanical properties of K562 cells have been previ - ously measured using different techniques . Indentation of optically trapped beads into cells immobilized on a ﬁbro - nectin - coated glass surface gave a stiffness of 160 Pa ( 48 ) . AFM measurements of cells trapped in microwells gave stiffness values at ~ 50 Pa ( 11 ) . Another AFM study of cells immobilized on a poly - L - lysine - coated glass surface re - ported a stiffness of 400 Pa ( 49 ) . Moreover , this study also measured cells after cytochalasin D treatment and reported a 50 % decrease in cell stiffness , which is in agreement with our ﬁndings . Considering that these measurements have been carried out under different strains and strain rates and over different timescales , our stiffness value of 296 Pa is in good agreement with published data . The stiffness of normally adherent MDA - MB - 231 breast cancer cells has also been measured with different tech - niques . Data reported for AFM measurements range from 257 ( 50 ) to 690 Pa ( 51 ) . Data reported for magnetic tweezer measurements range from 400 to 1000 Pa , depending on the applied force ( 52 ) . Measurements of MDA - MB - 231 cells in suspension using a microﬂuidic micropipette aspiration assay gave stiffness values at ~ 200 Pa ( 53 ) . Taken together , our stiffness value of 575 Pa is in reasonable agreement with published data on adherent MDA - MB - 231 cells . The fact that adherent cells need to be trypsinized and can only be measured in suspension with our measurement technique , however , implies several fundamental differ - ences from measurements of cells in their adherent state . Cell stiffness of adherent cells is mostly governed by the cytoskeletal prestress that arises from the cell cortex and stress ﬁbers ( 54 ) , and this prestress is balanced through matrix adhesions by the substrate . Cells in suspension lack stress ﬁbers , and the cortical tension is balanced by the hy - drostatic pressure . Despite these differences , mechanical changes in response to different drugs that we measure for cells in suspension qualitatively mirror those reported for adherent cells ( 33 ) . With our microconstriction setup , we achieve high - throughput ( 10 , 000 cells / h ) and at the same time a quantita - tive readout of cell mechanical properties using two strategies . First , we measure the size of each cell and the driving pressure in each of the parallel microconstrictions , from which we obtain a quantitative estimate of the mechan - ical stress and strain . Second , we apply the theory of soft glassy rheology to extract cell mechanical properties from the measurements . Soft glassy rheology predicts a power - law dependence of entry time on driving pressure and cell deformation . This power law implies a timescale - free cell mechanical behavior , which greatly simpliﬁes the task of quantitatively estimating cell mechanical parameters because measurements can be performed either slowly or rapidly yet they give identical results . It is this timescale invariance that makes quantitative high - speed measure - ments of cell mechanical properties possible in the ﬁrst place . Moreover , a power law is fully characterized by only two parameters , namely stiffness and ﬂuidity . A two - parameter estimation further simpliﬁes the task of measuring cell mechanical parameters . Finally , soft glassy rheology predicts that cell stiffness and ﬂuidity collapse onto a single master relationship , implying that cell mechan - ical properties are governed by only a single parameter , which in turn can be calculated from a single set of measure - ments ( e . g . , pressure , entry time , and size ) . We ﬁnd both predictions of soft glassy rheology , power - law behavior and collapse of the data onto a master curve , conﬁrmed by our measurements .

S1 Stability of microconstriction dimensions during pressure application : The device is filled with fluorescein - dextran ( FITC - dextran 70 , Sigma , 46945 ) , and the constrictions are imaged with a confocal microscope ( SP5 , Leica microsystems ) at a resolution of 0 . 2 µm × 0 . 2 µm × 0 . 5 µm during application of increasing pressures , ranging from 100 Pa to 150 kPa . a ) 3D view of a constriction . Inset : cross - sections of the channel and the constriction . b ) Constriction width versus externally applied pressure . Constriction dimensions increase only slightly with pressure . Error bars show standard deviations from 20 measurements evenly spaced along the length of the constriction . Inset shows a magnified view over the pressure range used in this study ( 0 - 10 kPa ) . Over this pressure range , no significant changes of constriction dimensions are observed . Fig . S2 Cell morphology , viability , and proliferation after chemical treatments or after passage through microconstrictions : a ) Radius of K562 cells is neither affected by treatment with different drugs ( concentrations and incubation times as specified in Methods ) , nor by washing and centrifugation ( 4min at 1400rpm ) , nor by 3 h incubation at room temperature in normal cell medium ( mean ± sd of n > 10 , 000 cells per condition ) , demonstrating that the cell mechanical responses reported here are not caused by secondary cell radius changes . b ) Cell viability of K562 cells is neither altered after drug treatments ( concentrations as specified in Methods , incubation times all prolonged by 1 h ) , nor after the preparation procedure ( washing , centrifugation for 4min at 1400rpm , resuspension ) , nor after 3 h incubation at room temperature . Cell viability is higher than 95 % for all conditions except after treatment with glutaraldehyde . Error bars are standard deviations of 25 field - of - views with a total of n > 10 , 000 cells for each condition . c ) Proliferation rates over 4 days for cells during incubation in 1 % pluronic , after the application of shear flow with a device consisting of a single 20 µm wide channel , and after passage through a microconstriction device without bypass . Cells are cultured in 96 well plates at an initial density of 250 , 000 cells / ml , and cell density is measured every 24 h with a Neubauer hemocytometer . The cell proliferation rate is calculated as the ratio of cell densities between consecutive days . Proliferation rates remain constant for all conditions and stable over time . Error bars are standard deviations from 8 measurements . Fig . S3 Dependency of cell speed on average flow speed : a ) Velocity profile of a rectangular channel ( x - y - profile , flow direction in y , h = 17 µm , w = 20 µm , focal plane at mid - section ) measured by tracking polystyrene beads of 1 µm in diameter suspended in cell culture medium . From the maximum velocity v max of the beads ( red line ) , the average flow speed of the medium v avg in a rectangular channel with h = 17 µm and w = 20 µm can be approximated as v avg = 0 . 48 ∙ v max ( 1 ) . b ) Dependency of relative cell speed v cell / v avg on the ratio of r cell / r ( hyd ) channel . The hydrodynamic radius of the channel r ( hyd ) channel is calculated as r ( hyd ) channel = h ∙ w / ( h + w ) . Cells in our experiments ( r cell / r ( hyd ) channel > 0 . 7 ) travel at lower speed than the average flow speed , and moreover the cell speed decreases with increasing cell radius . This can be approximated by a linear relationship according to v cell / v avg = 1 . 70 – 0 . 65 ( r cell / r ( hyd ) channel ) . Fig .

Pressure fluctuations are caused when cells enter or exit neighboring constrictions . Mean pressure is shown in black . b ) Power - law deformation of a cell in a microconstriction versus time computed for a constant ( mean ) pressure according to Eq . 2 ( black ) and for the fluctuating pressure according to Boltzmann superposition ( red ) . c ) Distributions of the power - law exponent of n = 2984 cells under control conditions computed with Eq . 4 from the mean pressure transit time (  mean , black ) and the full pressure transit time (  full , red ) . d ) Relative error ( 𝛿𝛽 = 100 (  full -  mean ) /  full ) of power - law exponents for n = 2984 control cells ( in % ) . The mean error of the power - law exponent 〈𝛿𝛽〉 approaches zero ( - 0 . 015 % ) , indicating that the mean pressure approximation does not introduce a systematic error . The standard deviation of this error is 2 . 2 % . Taken together , the mean pressure approximation for estimating cell mechanical properties with Eqs . 2 and 4 is unbiased and accurate for all practical purposes . Fig .

For each pressure or strain range , we obtain an average value for cell stiffness and fluidity . c ) Cell stiffness versus working pressures for control cells and cells treated with cytochalasin D and glutaraldehyde . Cell stiffness is only slightly changed at different working pressures . d ) The power - law exponent does not increase significantly with working pressures for different drug treatments . e ) Cell stiffness increases significantly with maximum cell deformation particularly after glutaraldehyde treatment , indicating strain stiffening . f ) The power - law exponent does only slightly depend on maximum cell deformation for different drug treatments . Taken together , the simplified assumption of pressure - and strain - independent cell mechanical properties is violated after glutaraldehyde treatment , but for all other drug treatments it is a reasonable approximation and is justified by the major simplification and numerical robustness for determining cell mechanical properties Fig . S6 Effect of lamin A - overexpression on adherent cells ( epithelial breast carcinoma cells , MDA - MB - 231 ) : As transfected cells are not FACS - sorted , we confirm a 2 . 3 - fold increase of lamin A expression levels over control by Western blot analysis ( data not shown ) . Adherent cells are trypsinized for 5 min before measurements and filtered with a cell strainer ( pore size = 40 µm ) to remove cell agglomerates . All measurements are completed within 40 min after trypsinization . a ) Scatter plots of transit times versus applied pressure for control cells ( top ) and for GFP - lamin A transfected MDA - MB - 231 cells ( bottom ) . Black markers represent the geometric mean of approximately 500 cells binned according to pressure . Solid lines are the fit of Eq . 3 to the binned data . Fit to control data is shown for comparison in the LaA + plot ( dashed line ) . b ) Population average of cell stiffness ( top ) and cell fluidity ( bottom ) for lamin A - overexpressing cells differ significantly ( p < 0 . 0005 , indicated by asterisks ) from control . Error bars represent standard deviations calculated by bootstrapping . These data are similar to our measurements on suspended K562 cells and demonstrate that our method can also be used to measure the mechanical properties of normally adherent cells .
