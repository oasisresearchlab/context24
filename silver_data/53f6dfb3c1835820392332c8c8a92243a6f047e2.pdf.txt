Michael Lord and Lynne M . Roberts Department of Biological Sciences , University of Warwick , Coventry CV4 7AL United Kingdom T he synthesis , segregation , intracellular transport , and exocytic export of secretory proteins in eukary - otic cells is now well understood . Synthesis begins on free cytosolic ribosomes that subsequently attach to the ER , resulting in the cotranslational discharge of the na - scent proteins into the ER lumen . The targeting signals and the cytosolic and ER membrane components that me - diate the translocation step have been extensively charac - terized and reviewed ( for example , see 29 ) . The ER lumen contains a range of resident proteins responsible for modi - fying newly synthesized polypeptides , and for ensuring correct folding into the biologically active conformation ( 9 ) . Secretion entails transport of the proteins from the ER , via the Golgi stack and the TGN , to secretory vesicles that ultimately fuse with the plasma membrane to com - plete protein export . The secretory pathway was eluci - dated by Palade and his colleagues ( 24 ) . Protein transport between the various compartments of the secretory path - way is mediated by carrier vesicles that bud from one com - partment and fuse with the next . Once again , many of the cellular components that are required for , and that regu - late , vesicular transport have been identified , and the mechanisms by which cytoplasmic protein coats drive the individual transport steps are now emerging ( 31 ) . It has been recognized for some time that the secretory pathway is at least partially reversible . For example , retrograde ve - sicular transport from the Golgi to the ER is needed to re - trieve resident ER proteins that have escaped from this compartment ( 25 ) , and endocytosis can transport proteins from the cell surface to the TGN ( 2 ) , which is the cellular location where the secretory and endocytic pathways con - verge ( 31 ) . ER resident proteins contain a retrieval sig - nal , the COOH - terminal tetrapeptide Lys - Asp - Glu - Leu ( KDEL ) , 1 which binds to a membrane receptor in the cis - Golgi region and returns them to the ER . Indeed the KDEL receptor is capable of retrieving escaped ER resi - dent proteins from as far along the secretory pathway as the TGN ; an exogenous synthetic peptide with a COOH - terminal KDEL sequence , which was introduced into the TGN from the cell surface was subsequently transported to the ER lumen ( 20 ) . Recently , it has become apparent that certain protein toxins follow this same route from the surface to the ER lumen . To reach their targets in the cy - tosol of mammalian cells the toxins apparently go one step further and cross the ER membrane . The emerging exper - imental evidence in support of this is reviewed here . Toxin Structure and Mode of Action Certain bacteria and plants produce proteins that are able to enter and kill mammalian cells . These proteins all act by catalytically modifying essential cellular components so that their normal function is prevented . In this review , we focus on a subset of these toxins that act by inhibiting cel - lular protein synthesis . Other catalytic toxins enter cells by the same mechanisms , and reference will be made to them ( where appropriate ) . Bacterial toxins that inhibit protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells include diphtheria toxin ( DT ) , Pseudomonas exotoxin A ( PE ) , and Shiga toxin ( ST ) , whereas the best characterized of a group of related plant toxins is ricin . DT , PE , and ricin are all synthesized as sin - gle polypeptide chains but in their functional form they ex - ist as heterodimers covalently joined by a single disulfide bond . DT and PE are cleaved into dimers after entering mammalian cells by the ubiquitous protease furin ( 7 ) , whereas ricin is cleaved in the plant cells that produce it ( 17 ) . In the heterodimeric toxins , one polypeptide ( often designated the A chain or fragment ) is catalytically active whereas the other ( the B chain or fragment ) is responsible for binding the toxin to receptors on the surface of suscep - tible cells . ST differs in structure from the other toxins de - scribed here in that the catalytic A chain is associated with a pentamer of B subunits , the so called AB 5 structure pos - sessed by other bacterial toxins such as cholera toxin and Escherichia coli heat labile enterotoxin . DT and PE inhibit protein synthesis by ADP - ribosylat - ing elongation factor – 2 ( 45 ) , whereas ST and ricin act by removing a specific adenine residue from a highly con - served loop present in 28S rRNA ( 5 ) . Since the toxin sub - strates are in the cell cytosol , the A chain must enter the target cell cytosol and retain its biologically active confor - mation . To enter mammalian cells , the toxins must first bind to a surface component . Binding can be to a specific protein such as the (cid:97) 2 - macroglobulin receptor ( used by PE ) ( 15 ) or a heparin - binding epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) - like growth factor precursor ( used by DT ) ( 21 ) , to glycolipids such as globotriaosyl ceramide ( used by ST ) Address all correspondence to J .

The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 140 , 1998 734 ( 11 ) , or ganglioside G M1 ( used by cholera toxin ) ( 44 ) , or to any appropriate glycoprotein or glycolipid ( as in the case of ricin whose B chain is a galactose - specific lectin ) ( 17 ) . Cell Entry Surface - bound toxin enters cells by endocytosis ; the en - docytic route depends on the nature of the receptor . DT , for example , appears to enter exclusively via clathrin - coated pits and vesicles . As such , overexpression of mu - tant dynamin , which prevents clathrin - dependent endocy - tosis , protects cells from intoxication by DT ( 40 ) . Such cells remain completely sensitive to ricin , however . Nor - mally ricin uses both clathrin - dependent and - independent endocytosis , so when the former route is effectively blocked the latter remains available . The clathrin - inde - pendent route used by ricin does not appear to be medi - ated by caveolae since it is unaffected by treatment with cholesterol - binding drugs such as nystatin ( 40 ) . ST appears to enter cells exclusively via clathrin - dependent endocyto - sis ( 33 ) , suggesting that its glycolipid receptor becomes fixed in coated pits , possibly by interacting with a protein already anchored there . Both the clathrin - dependent and the clathrin - independent uptake routes converge in endo - somes . At this stage the endocytosed toxins fall into two different behavioral groups : those that translocate into the cytosol from an endosomal compartment , and those that do not . Toxins whose A fragment crosses the endosomal membrane include DT , which has been most thoroughly studied , and others such as anthrax , tetanus , and botuli - num toxins . DT translocation depends crucially on the low pH of the endosomal compartment , which induces a con - formational change in DT B causing it to insert into the endosomal membrane and form , or contribute to the for - mation of , a proteinaceous pore through which the A frag - ment is able to pass . Further discussion of the DT translo - cation mechanism can be found elsewhere ( 37 ) . Since DT translocation requires low pH , treating cells with reagents that increase endosomal pH protects them from intoxication . Conversely , lowering the extracellular pH to that typically found in endosomes causes surface - bound DT to directly cross the plasma membrane . Increas - ing the intracellular pH does not protect cells against members of the second group of toxins ; toxins that do not translocate from endosomes including PE , ST , and ricin . Members of this second toxin group must proceed beyond endosomes to reach the compartment for A chain translo - cation . Intracellular Transport Beyond Endosomes The trafficking of endocytosed ricin beyond endosomes was initially followed by electron microscopy ( 42 ) . In addi - tion to entering lysosomes or being recycled back to the cell surface , a significant amount of toxin accumulated in the TGN . Initially this was interpreted as suggesting that ricin A chain translocated to the cytosol from the TGN ( 43 ) . With hindsight , a critical limitation of this experi - mental approach was its sensitivity . Whereas it clearly defined the fate of the bulk of the endocytosed toxin , the extreme potency of such proteins ( entry of just a few mol - ecules into the cytosol is believed sufficient to kill a cell ) meant that the productive but inefficient trafficking to the translocation compartment went undetected . One of the first experimental indications that toxins such as PE , ST , and ricin might not translocate from the TGN was the demonstration that treating the cells with brefeldin A ( BFA ) protected against these toxins but had no effect on their susceptibility to DT ( 50 ) . A careful morphological study of ricin trafficking in BFA - treated cells showed that in all lines where protection was seen , the typical BFA - induced dissembly of the Golgi stack had occurred ( 32 ) . Transport of ricin to the TGN was unaffected by BFA treatment . In contrast , treating MDCK cells with BFA did not confer protection against ricin nor did it structurally perturb the Golgi apparatus . Experiments with PE mutants suggested that PE might also undergo retrograde transport from the TGN to the ER , and provided a likely explanation of how this oc - curred . The last five COOH - terminal residues of the trans - located PE fragment are Arg - Glu - Asp - Leu - Lys ( REDLK ) . The effect of mutations in this pentapeptide on the cata - lytic activity and cytotoxicity of PE were determined . De - letions or substitutions predicted to prevent interaction with the KDEL receptor dramatically reduced cytotoxicity ( 3 ) . Such changes had no effect on catalytic activity and apparently cause reduced cytotoxicity by preventing the mutant forms from reaching the cytosol . Replacing the wild - type REDLK sequence with KDEL produced a mu - tant toxin even more cytotoxic than wild - type PE . ( 36 ) . The COOH - terminus of the catalytic polypeptide of chol - era toxin is KDEL , and that of E . coli heat labile entero - toxin is RDEL . Subsequent work has established that chol - era and E . coli heat - labile toxin action are also blocked by BFA treatment ( 4 ) . The cytotonic activity of these G pro - tein – modifying proteins is not absolutely dependent on the KDEL / RDEL tetrapeptide , although it apparently en - hances delivery into the cytosol ( 16 ) . EM studies have vi - sualized endocytosed ST ( 34 ) and cholera toxin ( 35 ) in the ER lumen , and cholera toxin transport from the plasma membrane to the ER has been described ( 18 ) . For toxins that contain KDEL or a KDEL analogue at the COOH - terminus of the translocated polypeptide , retrograde trans - port from the TGN to the ER is most probably achieved by interaction with the KDEL receptor which is now known to recycle between these compartments ( 8 , 20 ) . Pre - sumably , after endocytosis , recycling cell surface receptor delivers a proportion of the toxin to the TGN where recep - tor – toxin dissociation occurs leaving the free toxin able to opportunistically interact with the KDEL receptor . How do toxins such as ST and ricin , which do not pos - sess KDEL or a related peptide , travel from the TGN to the ER ? That ST can reach the ER lumen is beyond dis - pute since , as noted above , it has been visualized there . The effect of BFA treatment suggests that ricin must also traverse the Golgi stack to reach the ER . This contention was supported by the finding that addition of the KDEL retrieval signal to the COOH - terminus of ricin A chain significantly enhances cytotoxicity ( 46 ) . It seems likely that ricin undergoes retrograde transport from the TGN to the ER by binding to a recycling galactosylated component . Ri - cin B chain contains two functional galactose - binding sites , and is itself glycosylated . Because it has a high mannose oligosaccharide sidechain , ricin is able to intoxicate cells with mannose receptors , such as macrophages , even when Lord and Roberts Retrograde Transport of Toxins 735 binding to galactosylated surface components is prevented ( 38 ) . The effect of abrogating one or other or both B chain galactose - binding sites on the cytotoxicity of ricin entering macrophages via the mannose receptor showed that toxin retaining either of the B chain sugar - binding sites re - mained cytotoxic , but when both sites were destroyed , tox - icity was lost ( 22 ) . The putative recycling galactosylated component used by ricin for retrograde transport might itself carry a KDEL retrieval signal , be a transmembrane glycoprotein with a retrieval signal such as KKXX ( 12 ) , or may interact with another molecule that has a retrieval signal . The ER as the Site of Toxin Translocation Recently the first direct biochemical evidence that en - docytosed ricin reaches the ER before translocating to the cytosol has been presented ( 28 ) . Ricin A chain was modi - fied to contain a tyrosine sulfation site and overlapping N - glycosylation sites . Mutant A chain was reassociated with B chain and incubated with cells in the presence of Na 235 SO 4 and the A chain became radiolabeled . This la - beling identified that proportion of the endocytosed toxin that had reached the Golgi , and labeling was prevented by treatment with BFA or ilimaquinone . The labeled A chain underwent retrograde transport to the ER where it be - came core glycosylated , and then translocated to the cyto - sol . Only free glycosylated A chain entered the cytosol , in - dicating that transport to the ER was a prerequisite for translocation . At this stage it is unclear whether the A and B chains dissociate in the ER before translocation , or in the cytosol after translocation of the holotoxin . A similar experimental approach has confirmed that ST B fragment also reaches the ER via the Golgi apparatus ( 13 ) . Do Toxins Use the ER - associated Protein Degradation Pathway to Enter the Cytosol ? It has been known for some time that small glycopeptides can enter the cytosol directly from the ER ( 30 ) , and more recently it has become apparent that proteins and glyco - proteins also do so as part of the ER quality control func - tion ( 14 ) . Nascent secretory proteins enter the ER through a proteinaceous channel whose central component is Sec61p , the Sec61p translocon . Only if secretory proteins are folded correctly , and if appropriate , correctly assem - bled into oligomers , are they packaged into ER – Golgi transport vesicles . Proteins that fail to fold or assemble properly are instead exported across the ER membrane to the cytosol , where they are degraded by the proteasomes ( 10 , 47 ) . Human cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) takes advantage of this export machinery to downregulate antigen presen - tation at the cell surface by the class I major histocompati - bility complex ( MHC ) . CMV proteins in the ER cause dis - location of the transmembrane MHC class 1 heavy chain from the ER membrane to the cytosol , and its subsequent degradation by the proteasomes ( 48 , 49 ) . Genetic and bio - chemical experiments in Saccharomyces cerevisiae demon - strated that soluble , misfolded proteins are also exported across the ER membrane to the cytosol for degradation ( 10 , 19 ) . Coimmunoprecipitation studies indicated that the MHC class 1 heavy chain in CMV - infected cells might be exported through the Sec61p translocon ( 49 ) . Direct evi - dence for the involvement of Sec61p in the export of mis - folded proteins from the ER to the cytosol has recently been demonstrated in yeast ( 26 , 27 ) . It is likely that when toxins such as PE , ST , or ricin reach the ER lumen , thiol exchange catalyzed by protein disulfide isomerase causes dissociation of the disulfide - linked A and B subunits . Re - ductive dissociation in the oxidizing environment of the ER lumen has been demonstrated for disulfide - linked cholera toxin A fragments ( 23 ) . Dissociation of the toxin subunits exposes a hydrophobic region present in the A polypeptides that may promote unfolding or membrane interaction . In the case of ricin A chain , point mutations in this region do not affect catalytic activity but dramatically reduce ricin cytotoxicity , which may indicate that the hy - drophobic stretch plays some role in the membrane trans - location step ( 39 ) . The free A subunits may be perceived as unassembled polypeptides or—if ER resident chaper - ones cause partial unfolding—as misfolded polypeptides . Evidence that both DT A and ricin A chain partially un - fold during cell entry has been presented ( 1 , 6 ) . This may result in export to the cytosol by the ER quality control system . If this is the case , some of the exported toxin must avoid proteasomal degradation and assume its biologically active conformation in order to kill the cell . An in vitro study has reported that the NH 2 - terminal region of the translocated PE fragment promotes its own export after microsomal membrane insertion ( 41 ) . Summary and Future Prospects Bacterial and plant toxins that kill mammalian cells by modifying intracellular targets are unusual in that they both fold and traverse a membrane twice . They cross a membrane and fold for the first time as they are secreted from the producing bacteria or enter the ER lumen of the eukaryotic plant cells . During the intoxication process , the toxin A subunits partially unfold and again cross a mem - brane before refolding in the cytosol . Whereas some tox - ins , including DT , take advantage of the low pH to cross the endosomal membrane , others such as PE , ST , and ricin are apparently unable to form or become part of a translo - cation channel . Therefore , these toxins undergo retrograde transport through the secretory pathway to reach a cellu - lar compartment where protein - conducting channels are already present—the ER . This is achieved by parasitizing normal cellular components that recycle between the plasma membrane and the TGN , and between the TGN and the ER . From the ER , the toxins enter the cytosol , possibly via the Sec61p translocon , and perhaps by masquerading as substrates for the ER export machinery . It may be possible to take advantage of the ability of these toxins to reach the ER . For example , toxins may be able to directly deliver antigenic peptides to MHC class 1 molecules . Finally , toxin entry demonstrates that the eukaryotic secretory pathway is completely reversible . This is physiologically significant in that it provides a route by which these exogenous pro - teins reach their cytosolic targets . We thank Dr . K .
