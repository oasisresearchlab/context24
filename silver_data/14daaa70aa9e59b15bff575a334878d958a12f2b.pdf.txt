This article provides a critical review and synthesis of scientiﬁc knowledge on the number concentrations , size distributions , composition , mixing state , and related properties of respiratory particles emitted upon breathing , speaking , singing , coughing , and sneezing . We derive and present a parame - terization of respiratory particle size distributions based on ﬁve lognormal modes related to diﬀerent origins in the respiratory tract , which can be used to trace and localize the sources of infectious particles . This approach may support the medical treatment as well as the risk assessment for aerosol and droplet transmission of infectious diseases . It was applied to analyze which respiratory activities may drive the spread of speciﬁc pathogens , such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis , inﬂuenza viruses , and SARS - CoV - 2 viruses . The results conﬁrm the high relevance of vocalization for the transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 as well as the usefulness of physical distancing , face masks , room ventilation , and air ﬁltration as preventive measures against COVID - 19 and other airborne infectious diseases . a r X i v : 2 1 03 . 01188v4 [ phy s i c s . m e d - ph ] 4 A ug 2021 2 CONTENTS I .

INTRODUCTION Diseases that spread via the respiratory tract , such as measles , tuberculosis , inﬂuenza , and the coronavirus dis - ease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) have played dramatic and impor - tant roles in global public health ( e . g . , Cyranoski , 2020 ; Kutter et al . , 2018 ; Tellier et al . , 2019 ) . Disease out - breaks can be driven , in whole or large part , by emis - sions of pathogen - laden particles that can infect nearby ∗ m . pohlker @ mpic . de † c . pohlker @ mpic . de persons , such as those expelled in a spray of droplets or clouds of small airborne aerosols ( e . g . , Milton , 2020 ; Morawska , 2006 ; Seminara et al . , 2020 ; Tang et al . , 2021 ; Tellier et al . , 2019 ) . Knowledge on the relative impor - tance of transmission pathways and the mechanisms of host - to - host transmission , in relation to pathogen - host interactions and environmental factors , remain critical gaps of knowledge ( Bazant and Bush , 2021 ; Bourouiba , 2020a , and references therein ) . A detailed understand - ing of pathogen transmission dynamics in space and time is needed to improve public health interventions , which are a cornerstone in pandemic control besides vaccina - tion strategies , to control outbreaks and reduce infection rates ( Milton , 2020 ; Richard and Fouchier , 2016 ) . Several transmission routes for pathogens passable be - tween humans are known ( Judson and Munster , 2019 ; Kohanski et al . , 2020 ; Leung , 2021 ; Li , 2021 ; Seto , 2015 ) . The most widely occurring and relevant routes can be grouped into contact vs contact - free . Contact transmis - sion from an infected individual to a susceptible recipient can occur through either direct person - to - person contact ( e . g . , a handshake ) or indirect contact via contaminated objects or surfaces ( fomites ) , followed by a hand - to - face transport of pathogens ( i . e . , self - inoculation of eyes , nose or mouth ) ( Asadi et al . , 2020a ; Schulze - R¨obbecke , 2014 ) . Transmission without physical contact , through the air , can occur via both near - and far - ﬁeld transmis - sion from either small or large particles being emitted by the mouth or nose of infected individuals via cough - ing , sneezing , talking , or even breathing ( e . g . , Chen et al . , 2020 ; Fennelly , 2020 ; Li , 2021 ; Morawska , 2006 ; NASEM , 2020 ; Scheuch , 2020 ; Schulze - R¨obbecke , 2014 ; Tang et al . , 2021 ) . For this pathway , the terms contact - free and air - borne are commonly used . Particles containing viable pathogens can then land directly on the mucosal surfaces of the recipient or can be inhaled . This review focuses only on emissions from the respiratory tract , deﬁned here as the path of respiratory air from deep lungs through the mouth and nose . Nevertheless , other emissions of po - tentially pathogen - laden particles , e . g . from the human body ( i . e . , the ”personal cloud” eﬀect of skin , clothing emissions ) and of aerosolized fecal material can also play critical roles in disease transmission , if deposited in the respiratory tract of a recipient ( e . g . , Johnson et al . , 2013 ; Kang et al . , 2020 ; Lai et al . , 2018 ; Meadow et al . , 2015 ; Sherertz et al . , 2001 ; Yamamoto et al . , 2015 ; Yang et al . , 2021 ; You et al . , 2013 ) . Particles with diameters larger than ∼ 100 µ m are of - ten called droplets in the context of respiratory emissions ( Prather et al . , 2020a ) . After being emitted , droplets fol - low ( semi - ) ballistic trajectories to deposit directly onto objects or mucosal surfaces , i . e . , in the nose , mouth , or eyes . Due to the large mass they are only weakly in - ﬂuenced by the airﬂow and inhalation is relatively un - likely ( Hinds , 1999 ; Vincent et al . , 1990 ; Volkwein et al . , 2011 ) . Droplets also have too much mass to stay sus - 3 FIG . 1 Conceptual scheme of the aerosol and droplet pathogen transmission routes along with relevant physicochemical prop - erties of respiratory particles . pended for longer than a few seconds and so fall to the ground rapidly within about one to two meters of the emitter ( Chen et al . , 2020 ; Prather et al . , 2020a ) . The near - ﬁeld deposition of droplets largely depends on par - ticle size and emission velocity , and thus extends increas - ingly further from the source via singing or shouting as well as coughing or sneezing ( e . g . , Bourouiba , 2020a , b ; Bourouiba et al . , 2014 ; Mittal et al . , 2020 ) . Particles with diameters smaller than ∼ 100 µ m are often called aerosols or droplet nuclei in the context of respiratory emissions and have suﬃciently small mass and momen - tum to be inhalable via airﬂow into the respiratory tract ( e . g . , Vincent et al . , 1990 ) . Respiratory aerosols are gen - erally present in the highest concentration in the near - ﬁeld in a plume closest to the emitter , but can also mix readily into a volume of air in the far - ﬁeld ( e . g . , Chen et al . , 2020 ; Lelieveld et al . , 2020 ; Samet et al . , 2021 ; Tang et al . , 2021 ) . They can remain suspended for min - utes or even hours , depending on particle size and the free air turbulence or ﬂow dynamics ( Bourouiba , 2020a ) . Thus , it can be possible for aerosols to be a dominant mode of transmission in both the near - ﬁeld ( 1 - 2 m ) and far - ﬁeld ( e . g . , mixed into room air ) ( e . g . , Chen et al . , 2020 ; Li , 2021 ; Nissen et al . , 2020 ; Yang et al . , 2020 ) , though mitigation strategies may diﬀer within the two categories of distance . Disease transmission through exhaled particles can tend predominantly toward the aerosol route if mostly small and readily airborne particles containing viable pathogens are emitted , or predominantly towards the droplet route if mostly large and ( semi - ) ballistically dis - tributed droplets are involved . This distinction is largely a function of pathogen - host interaction and physiological factors . The boundary between aerosols and droplets is fraught , because , from a physical perspective , they each lie at diﬀerent ends of a size continuum ( Wilson et al . , 2020 ) . Historically , a dividing size of 5 µ m has been uti - lized , but this has relatively little support from either physical or physiological reasoning ( Li , 2021 ; Tang et al . , 2021 ) . For example , the settling velocity of a 5 µ m leads to a residence time of 25 minutes . Upward convection from body heat and other turbulent dynamics make the estimation of residence time more complicated , but even particles smaller than this will mix into the majority of the room volume and are thus relevant for inhalation in the far - ﬁeld . More recently a dividing size of 100 µ m has become more commonly accepted , largely because this is approximately the size above which particles are un - 4 likely to be inhaled , based on the physics of airﬂow into the respiratory tract ( Beggs , 2020 ; Bourouiba , 2020b ; Jayaweera et al . , 2020 ; Prather et al . , 2020a ) . It should also be noted that , while many communities diﬀerenti - ate between aerosol and droplet size regimes , the speciﬁc cut - point deﬁnition between the regimes can be diﬀer - ent . In the near - ﬁeld , infection can be caused by ballis - tic droplet spray and contact - based mechanisms , as well as by inhalation of concentrated aerosol clouds , which means that near - ﬁeld aerosol infection can mimic epi - demiological patterns of large - droplet spray or contact infections ( Bourouiba , 2020a ; Chen et al . , 2020 ; Roy and Milton , 2004 ) . Accordingly , it can be very complicated to separate these processes to identify the most signiﬁ - cant route for a given pathogen ( Fennelly , 2020 ; Milton , 2012 ; Morawska et al . , 2020 ; Tellier et al . , 2019 ) . The size range of deposited pathogen - containing particles can also play an important role in the development and severity of the disease ( e . g . , Port et al . , 2020 ; Zuo et al . , 2020 ) . The ’classical’ examples of pathogens that spread pre - dominantly via aerosols are Mycobacterium tuberculo - sis causing tuberculosis ( TB ) , the measles morbillivirus ( MeV ) causing measles , and the varicella - zoster virus ( VZV ) causing chickenpox ( e . g . , Bloch et al . , 1985 ; Jones - Lopez et al . , 2013 ; Leung , 2021 ; Riley et al . , 1978 , 1959 , 1962 ; Tellier et al . , 2019 ) . More ’exotic’ pathogens that can spread via aerosols are the bacteria Coxiella bur - netii causing Q fever and the spores of Bacillus anthracis causing anthrax ( e . g . , Fennelly et al . , 2004a ; de Rooij et al . , 2016 ) . For the COVID - 19 pandemic , caused by the readily transmissible severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) ( Satija and Lal , 2007 ; Zuo et al . , 2020 ) , the preponderance of evidence suggests that SARS - CoV - 2 is aerosol - transmissible with virus - laden respiratory particles transmitted through the air being ( key ) drivers of infection ( e . g . , Anderson et al . , 2020 ; Asadi et al . , 2020a ; Birgand et al . , 2020 ; van Doremalen et al . , 2020 ; Hadei et al . , 2020 ; Klompas et al . , 2020 ; Kut - ter et al . , 2020 ; Kwon et al . , 2020 ; Lednicky et al . , 2021 , 2020 ; Liu et al . , 2020 ; MacIntyre and Ananda - Rajah , 2020 ; Miller et al . , 2020 ; Morawska et al . , 2020 ; NASEM , 2020 ; Nissen et al . , 2020 ; Prather et al . , 2020a ; Qian et al . , 2020 ; Santarpia et al . , 2020a ; Scheuch , 2020 ; Sommer - stein et al . , 2020 ; Tang et al . , 2021 ) . This is in line with studies suggesting that the closely related coronaviruses SARS - CoV - 1 and MERS - CoV ( Middle - East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus ) also spreads through aerosols as well ( e . g . , Booth et al . , 2005 ; Li et al . , 2005 ; Olsen et al . , 2003 ; Wong et al . , 2004 ; Yu et al . , 2004 ) . Figure 1 illustrates the life cycle of respiratory parti - cles in contact - free pathogen transmission , spanning from exhalation over airborne transport to the potential infec - tion of a recipient ( Samet et al . , 2021 ) . The emission of particles in relation to respiratory activities , such as breathing , speaking , singing , coughing , and sneezing has been analyzed in numerous studies , as summarized , e . g . , in reviews by Gralton et al . ( 2011 ) , Han et al . ( 2013 ) , and Bake et al . ( 2019 ) . The ﬂuid dynamics involved in the spread of the exhaled multiphase cloud of poten - tially pathogen - laden particles was summarized , e . g . , by Bourouiba ( 2020a ) , Seminara et al . ( 2020 ) , and Mittal et al . ( 2020 ) . The transmitted pathogen dose response of the recipient is determined by multiple factors , such as the number , size distribution , and physicochemical prop - erties of the pathogen bearing particles being inhaled or deposited on mucosal surfaces during a given exposure time ( Haas , 2015 ) . The droplet route is exclusively rel - evant in the near - ﬁeld through droplet spray deposition on persons or objects ( creating fomites ) . The aerosol routes can be relevant in the near - ﬁeld upon inhalation of concentrated clouds of small particles near the emitter as well as in the far - ﬁeld when small particles accumu - late in indoor environments ( e . g . , in schools , restaurants , public transport ) or are distributed via directed air ﬂows ( e . g . , air conditioning ) before signiﬁcant dilution occurs ( e . g . , Birnir and Angheluta , 2020 ; Bourouiba et al . , 2014 ; Chang et al . , 2020 ; Chen et al . , 2020 ; Jayaweera et al . , 2020 ; Li et al . , 2005 ; Lu et al . , 2020 ; Nissen et al . , 2020 ; Qian et al . , 2020 ; Stadnytskyi et al . , 2020 ; Yang et al . , 2020 ) . The aerosol infection pathway is largely inﬂuenced by individual physiological factors of both the emitter ( e . g . , high individual variation in infectiousness with super - spreading individuals ) and the recipient ( enhanced sus - ceptibility due to pre - existing conditions , co - infections , etc . ) ( e . g . , Bischoﬀ et al . , 2013 ; Edwards et al . , 2021 ; Le - ung , 2021 ; Lloyd - Smith et al . , 2005 ; Miller et al . , 2020 ) . Important is also the timing of maximum pathogen repli - cation with associated exhalation and the encounter of emitter and recipient . Current evidence on the repli - cation and emission of wild - type SARS - CoV - 2 , for in - stance , peaks two to three days prior to and on the ﬁrst days of symptom onset ( Ferretti et al . , 2020 ; He et al . , 2020 ; Matricardi et al . , 2020 ) . A mechanistic understand - ing of essential processes in Fig . 1 requires transdisci - plinary bridges between infection epidemiology , virology , pulmonology , and immunology as well as aerosol physics and chemistry , ﬂuid dynamics , and related ﬁelds ( Milton , 2020 ; Morawska , 2006 ; Santl - Temkiv et al . , 2019 ) . This review article addresses the microphysical par - ticle properties involved in contact - free diseases trans - mission . It focuses particularly on the concentrations and size distributions of respiratory particles , as well as the distribution of pathogens within these carrier parti - cle populations . Section II provides a general and concise summary of deﬁnitions , nomenclature , and key parame - ters as well as mechanistically relevant information on droplet formation in the respiratory tract , followed by rapid droplet desiccation after emission . Section III fol - lows with an in - depth review and synthesis of the sci - entiﬁc literature on respiratory particle size distributions ( PSDs ) from breathing , speaking and singing . A general - 5 ized multimodal , lognormal parameterization of exhaled PSDs is introduced here , which is based on previous ob - servations and parameterization approaches ( Asadi et al . , 2019 ; Chao et al . , 2009 ; Han et al . , 2013 ; Johnson et al . , 2011 ; Morawska et al . , 2009 ) . The new parameteriza - tion ( i ) covers the size range from < 10 nm to > 1000 µ m , ( ii ) is based on the smallest number of modes needed to adequately represent the available experimental PSDs weighted both by particle number and volume , ( iii ) is widely representative of the existing literature , and ( iv ) is readily applicable to modelling studies . The parame - terization has further been related to the emission mech - anisms and sites in the respiratory tract as well as to mode - speciﬁc particle number concentrations in relation to diﬀerent respiratory activities . Finally , using the mul - timodal parameterization , emission mechanisms and par - ticle size modes are identiﬁed , which are most closely associated with the spread of common pathogens . The literature summary and consistent parameterization of the exhaled PSDs can be used as a framework for im - proved understanding , control , and prevention of infec - tious disease transmission , such as for COVID - 19 and other present and future diseases , which spread via the respiratory tract . II . DEFINITIONS , NOMENCLATURE , AND KEY PARAMETERS IN AEROSOL AND DROPLET PATHOGEN TRANSMISSION A . Deﬁnitions and nomenclature on respiratory aerosol and droplets A major challenge in the multidisciplinary ﬁeld of air - borne disease transmission is that the diﬀerent scientiﬁc communities involved often ”don’t speak the same lan - guage” ( Milton , 2020 ) . Moreover , the terminology is not always clearly deﬁned or consistently used and , thus can promote misunderstandings ( Roy and Milton , 2004 ; Tang et al . , 2021 ) . The fundamental terms aerosol and droplet are used especially inconsistently by diﬀerent scientiﬁc communities and with diﬀerent meanings and implica - tions . The term droplet can convey two broadly diﬀerent con - cepts : ( i ) it is often used as a counterpart for aerosol in a dichotomous classiﬁcation of airborne vs ( semi ) ballistic transmission routes ( see details below ) . In this sense , the term droplet is meant to diﬀerentiate a particular ( large ) particle size regime marked by aerodynamic behavior separate from the smaller range of the size continuum of respiratory particles . ( ii ) Moreover , the term droplet is also frequently used to mean respiratory particles that contain water . Note , however , that all respiratory par - ticles comprise signiﬁcant amounts of water upon exha - lation and , thus can be considered as droplets , regard - less of size ( Bourouiba , 2020a ; Tang et al . , 2021 ) . Fur - ther , the term droplet nuclei is commonly used , within broadly medically - oriented communities , for the remain - ing residues after evaporation of respiratory droplets ( Bourouiba et al . , 2014 ; Chao et al . , 2009 ; Niazi et al . , 2020 ) . This use of the terms nucleus or nuclei is some - what inconsistent from a process perspective . ”Nuclei” , as deﬁned within the scope of atmospheric physics , are those particles involved in a nucleation process that lead to particle growth , e . g . , a physical surface on which cloud droplets or ice crystals initiate growth . The term droplet nuclei , however , here refers to the end point of droplet desiccation and , thus , shrinkage of a droplet rather than growth from a seed nucleus . The term aerosol is used in some ﬁelds as a synonym for droplet nucleus , whereas communities of physical sci - ence typically use the term aerosol to refer to particles small enough to stay suspended in air for some period of time ( as deﬁned more speciﬁcally below ) . Use of the term airborne is especially contentious and inconsistently used within the context of respiratory disease ( Klompas et al . , 2020 ; Li , 2021 ; Roy and Milton , 2004 ; Tang et al . , 2021 ; Tellier et al . , 2019 ) . In most sub - ﬁelds of the phys - ical sciences the term airborne is associated broadly with particles that are suspended in or transported through the air . In this context , both smaller aerosol particles and droplets can be considered airborne , although the residence time in air and ability to be inhaled varies strongly with particle size ( Hinds , 1999 ; Morawska and Milton , 2020 ; Prather et al . , 2020a ; Samet et al . , 2021 ) . For these reasons , the majority of discussion associated with the term airborne among physical scientists is asso - ciated with aerosols ( Chen et al . , 2020 ) . In stark contrast to this perspective , non - physical sub - ﬁelds of science and medicine have historically applied additional limitations to the use of the term airborne , e . g . to aerosol - based dis - eases with demonstrably high basic reproduction num - bers ( R 0 ) such as measles , but without speciﬁc physical or mechanistic reasoning ( Leung , 2021 ; Li , 2021 ; Milton , 2020 ; Tang et al . , 2021 ) . A broader discussion of the dif - ferences in the way diﬀerent communities deﬁne this term will not be addressed in detail here . For the purposes of this discussion , we will adopt a physical perspective of the term airborne , comprising both smaller aerosols and larger droplets . For clarity , we deﬁne here the terminology used throughout this manuscript : • Aerosol : According to the established text book deﬁnition , an aerosol is deﬁned as a suspension of liquid or solid particles in a gas , with parti - cle diameters ranging from few nm up to about 100 µ m ( Frohlich - Nowoisky et al . , 2016 ; Hinds , 1999 ; P¨oschl , 2005 ; Seinfeld and Pandis , 2016 ) . Note that sometimes the term aerosols ( with plu - ral s ) is used to refer speciﬁcally to the suspended particles , which frequently causes confusion in re - lation to the aforementioned rigorous deﬁnition of 6 aerosol , which is already plural with respect to the particles involved . The term droplet nuclei is fre - quently used within medical communities to be syn - onymous with aerosol . • Droplets : Generally speaking , droplets are liquid particles . In the medical and epidemiological litera - ture the term droplet is frequently used for aqueous liquid particles larger than 5 µ m in diameter . Here , the term droplet has been used cautiously to avoid misunderstandings . We used it only for aqueous droplets ( of all sizes ) directly upon emission from the respiratory tract , regardless of particle size . Af - ter the onset of drying ( which happens quickly ) , the terms residue or dried particle are used for the partially or fully dried droplets . Note that we avoid using the term droplet nuclei , because the term nu - cleus has the aforementioned diﬀerent meaning in aerosol physics . • Particles : The term particle refers here to the en - tire population of liquid or solid particles encom - passing the full spectrum of possible sizes , as well as physical and chemical states . Throughout the text , we predominantly use the terms particle and aerosol , and to only a minor degree the term droplet . Where not clear from the context , we further speciﬁed these terms with attributes deﬁned by physical properties such as aerodynamic behavior , i . e . , airborne vs ( semi - ) ballistic , or water content , i . e . , wet vs dry / dried . Often , a particular particle size range is of relevance – in these cases we have numerically speciﬁed the diame - ter thresholds ( e . g . , > 1 µ m or from 0 . 1 to 10 µ m ) . To broadly subdivide the modes of the particle size distri - bution into two groups according to the commonly ap - plied set of measurement instrumentation ( see Tab . IV , Sect . III . B . 2 , and Sect . III . B . 3 ) , we have used the rela - tive terms small for all modes centered below 5 µ m and large for all modes centered above 5 µ m . Note that this 5 µ m threshold is not related to the traditionally used 5 µ m threshold in a dichotomous classiﬁcation of aerosol vs droplet infection routes ( see details below ) . All parti - cle sizes in this manuscript refer to diameter and never to radius . Neither the lower nor upper aerosol size ranges have rigorously deﬁned physical limits : The lower limit is marked by a gradual transition from gas molecules and larger molecular clusters to nanometer - sized particles . The upper limit is given by the gradually changing aero - dynamic properties of particles that vary as a function of size when moving in a gas , the most important of which is the increased sedimentation rate of large particles due to gravity . An alternative , but parallel transition at the upper size limit is the point at which particles become too big to be eﬃciently inhalable ( e . g . , Hinds , 1999 ; Vincent et al . , 1990 ) . Here , the particle’s Reynolds number ( Re ) , which is the ratio of the resisting force of the viscous gas to the inertial force of the moving particle , separates the Stokes regime ( with viscous forces > > inertial forces and Re < 1 ) from the purely ballistic Newton regime ( with viscous forces < < inertial forces and Re > 1000 ) with a semi - ballistic transition regime in between ( 1 < Re < 1000 ) ( Hinds , 1999 ) . Thus , Re quantiﬁes to which degree the particles are prone to follow the air streams patterns , e . g . , upon inhalation . Re is calculated through Re = ρ g v s D η ( 1 ) with the density of the gas ( ρ g ) , which is the density of air here , the relative velocity between air and particle ( v s ) , which is here the settling velocity , the particle di - ameter ( D ) , and the gas dynamic viscosity ( η ) , also for air here . For a spherical particle in the Stokes regime , v s is calculated through v s = ρ p D 2 g C c 18 η ( 2 ) with C c = 1 + λ D (cid:20) 2 . 34 + 1 . 05 exp (cid:18) − 0 . 39 D λ (cid:19)(cid:21) for ( Re < 1 ) with the particle density ( ρ p ) , the gravitational acceler - ation ( g ) , the Cunningham slip correction ( C c ) , and λ as the gas mean - free - path ( Hinds , 1999 ) . C c matters pri - marily for particles with D < 1 µ m and converges to unity for D > 1 µ m . For a spherical particle in the transition regime , v s is calculated through v s = (cid:18) 4 ρ p D g 3 C D ρ g (cid:19) 12 ( 3 ) with C D = 24 Re (cid:0) 1 + 0 . 15 Re 0 . 687 (cid:1) for ( Re > 1 ) with the drag coeﬃcient ( C D ) . Re for water drops with D < 80 µ m in room conditions is < 1 and so for this size range , using the Stokes drag would not result in signiﬁ - cant errors . Note that the drag coeﬃcient ( C D ) in Eq . 3 is an empirical correction , which depends on v s . Within the Stokes regime and in quiescent / still air , v s scales with D 2 , spanning from essentially inﬁnite airborne residence times for smaller particles ( i . e . , D < 1 µ m ) to ﬁnite settling velocities for large particles ( Fig . 2 ) . For example , for an exhalation at 1 . 5 m height , a 5 µ m particle settles out within ∼ 30 min , a 8 µ m parti - cle settles out within ∼ 10 min , whereas a 20 µ m particle settles out within ∼ 2 min . In real - world settings , how - ever , the air is typically not still , but rather inﬂuenced by air movements on diﬀerent scales , including upward convection due to heating from bodies , and so the parti - cle residence time in the air of occupied rooms is usually 7 FIG . 2 Size dependence of the Reynolds number ( Re ) , set - tling velocity ( v s ) , and sedimentation time from 1 . 5 m height ( t s ) for spherical particles in still air . Gray shadings high - lights Stokes ( Re < 1 ) vs transition regimes ( 1 < Re < 1000 ) . Vertical dashed lines mark frequently used threshold at 5 µ m to separate large vs small particles as well as threshold at 100 µ m as proposed by Prather et al . ( 2020a ) . much longer than in still air . The drag of the ambient air can extend particle residence times signiﬁcantly ( Bazant and Bush , 2021 ; Milton , 2020 ) . For non - spherical parti - cles , Eq . 2 should be modiﬁed to take particle shape into account . If particle shape does not deviate clearly from a sphere , the errors from using Eq . 2 are not signiﬁcant ( Bagheri and Bonadonna , 2016 ) . Figure 2 shows that aerosol and droplet transmission routes cannot be strictly separated , but exist in diﬀer - ent size regimes of a particle size and ﬂuid mechanical continuum . The terminology used to separate the con - cepts of aerosol and droplet transmission often causes more confusion than clarity by introducing the false no - tion that droplets and aerosols are somehow fundamen - tally diﬀerent ( Beggs , 2020 ; Bourouiba , 2020b ) . Further , historically inaccurate understandings of the physics of airborne particles persists in many scientiﬁc disciplines today , and deeply held disciplinary beliefs and nomen - clature add to the confusion ( e . g . , Allen and Marr , 2020 ; Beggs , 2020 ; Gralton et al . , 2011 ; Hsiao et al . , 2020 ; Jones et al . , 2020 ; Li , 2021 ; Milton , 2020 ; Roy and Milton , 2004 ; Samet et al . , 2021 ; Tang et al . , 2021 ) . Bourouiba ( 2020b ) , for instance , criticized the widely used and ”overly sim - pliﬁed [ . . . ] dichotomous classiﬁcation between large vs small droplets [ with ] various arbitrary droplet diameter cutoﬀs , from 5 to 10 µ m” , which still underlies the cur - rent risk management , recommendations , and infection control . Bourouiba ( 2020b ) further proposes to consider aerosol and droplet spray transmission as a multiphase turbulent cloud of buoyant hot and moist air that con - tains a continuous range of particle sizes ( Bourouiba , 2020b ; Bourouiba et al . , 2014 ; Ng et al . , 2020 ) . In this context , Prather et al . ( 2020a ) advocated that 100 µ m would be a more appropriate threshold than the histori - cally used 5 or 10 µ m . All such clear - cut boundaries are a simpliﬁcations of the physics involved . Nevertheless , if a threshold has to be deﬁned , 100 µ m appears as the most appropriate choice , as it is roughly the diameter at which Re ≈ 1 and beyond which the drag force acting on the particle no longer varies linearly with the Re ( Fig . 2 ) . It further corresponds to the largest particle size that is typically inhalable , and so provides compelling practical beneﬁt with respect to transmission pathways and miti - gation strategies . Concerning the composition of respiratory particles , we use the following terminology throughout the text : Mucosal ﬂuids comprise a large group of liquid surface ﬁlms ( e . g . , tear ﬂuid , nasal mucus , bronchial mucus , gas - tric mucus , sweat , etc . ) that cover diﬀerent parts of the body or organ surfaces exposed to the external environ - ment ( Bansil and Turner , 2006 ; Schenkels et al . , 1995 ) . These ﬂuids typically have site - speciﬁc composition and fulﬁll a variety of speciﬁc functions . The following two mucosal ﬂuids play an essential role in respiratory parti - cle emission : • Saliva is present in the oral cavity , where it is pro - duced by diﬀerent salivary glands ( Humphrey and Williamson , 2001 ; Schenkels et al . , 1995 ) . • Epithelial lining ﬂuid ( ELF ) cover the air - facing surfaces of the lower respiratory tract ( LRT ) . Note that in addition to ELF , the terms respira - tory tract lining ﬂuid ( RTLF ) , airways surface liq - uid ( ASL ) , and mucus are also widely used in the literature ( Bansil and Turner , 2006 ) . Here we re - strict use to the term ELF . Further , we use the terms mucosalivary or mucosal ﬁlms and ﬂuids to refer to both ELF and saliva . An overview of the complex and variable composition of saliva and ELF can be found in Sect . II . C . The term respiratory particles here refers to emissions from both saliva and ELF . B . Properties of respiratory particles The physicochemical aerosol properties that matter most in the spread of diseases are • particle number and volume concentration ( Sect . II . B . 1 and Sect . III . C ) • particle number and volume size distribution ( Sect . II . B . 2 and Sect . III ) • size - dependent distribution of pathogens in the respiratory carrier particle population ( Sect . II . B . 3 and Sect . III . D ) 8 • composition and hygroscopicity of the mucosali - vary particles along with their desiccation and ( re ) humidiﬁcation properties ( Sect . II . C ) Further , physical and biochemical properties of the pathogens themselves play important roles , which are ad - dressed only brieﬂy in Sect . II . B . 4 . For further details , refer to the cited literature . 1 . Particle number and volume concentrations and emission rates The particle number ( N ) or volume ( V p ) concentration ( C ) in an air volume ( V air ) deﬁnes the overall abundance of exhaled ( and potentially pathogen bearing ) particles according to C N = N V air and C V = V p V air ( 4 ) The particle emission rates ( Q ) are derived through Q N = N f and Q V = V p f ( 5 ) as well as Q N = C N ˙ V and Q V = C V ˙ V ( 6 ) with a given N and V p , the rate ( f ) of a given respiratory event , as well as the air emission rate ( ˙ V ) . Table I sum - marizes average parameters for respiratory events and speciﬁes those values used in the calculations in this work . The particle source is highly variable in terms of strength and frequency . It spans from semi - continuous tidal breathing to short and intense events such as sneez - ing with a duration ∆ t < 1 s ( Table I ) . The inter - and intrasubject variability in C N as a function of respira - tory activity and physiological factors is remarkably high , spanning two to three orders of magnitude from ∼ 0 . 1 up to ∼ 100 cm − 3 ( e . g . , Asadi et al . , 2019 ; Bake et al . , 2017 ; Duguid , 1946 ; Gregson et al . , 2021 ; Holmgren et al . , 2010 ; Morawska et al . , 2009 ; Schwarz et al . , 2015 ; Xie et al . , 2009 ) . The C N and Q N can be converted in C V and Q V through C V = π 6 D 3 C N and Q V = π 6 D 3 Q N ( 7 ) under the assumption that the particles have a ( nearly ) spherical shape . Exhaled puﬀs of air are discontinuous , turbulent ﬂuid volumes emitted from a point source ( mouth or nose ) and driven at ﬁrst by momentum and subsequently by buoyancy . The puﬀs are spatially heterogeneous due to mixing and dilution in turbulent eddies and variable wa - ter vapor and temperature ﬁelds , which results in a de - crease in C N with distance from the source and , there - fore , makes analysis of measurements complicated to in - terpret ( Bourouiba , 2020a ; Gregson et al . , 2021 ; Ng et al . , 2020 ) . Note further that the C N levels are typically much lower than ambient aerosol concentrations ( both indoor and outdoor ) , which typically range from few hundreds to few thousands particles per cm 3 ( e . g . , Andreae , 2009 ; Vette et al . , 2001 ) . This imposes further experimental challenges since the ambient background aerosol must ei - ther be removed ( i . e . , ﬁltration ) or carefully characterized ( i . e . , background subtraction ) . Even in a clean - room en - vironment , however , it is very challenging to detect the inﬂuence of respiratory aerosols on top of existing particle concentrations unless particles are selectively detected , e . g . , based on diﬀerences in composition . For a compar - ison of respiration C N levels from diﬀerent studies , it is essential to specify the measurement size range as most instruments or techniques cover only a limited band of the overall relevant size distribution ( see Table IV ) . Thus , most reported number concentrations do not account for the total C N , but rather a subset within a certain size range determined by the instruments’ speciﬁcations . As one result of the parameterization of particle size dis - tributions presented in this study , Sect . III . C presents a statistical summary of measured particle number and vol - ume concentrations as well as emission rates in relation to respiratory activities . 2 . Particle number and volume size distributions The initial particle size distribution ( PSD ) right immediately following emission depends on the for - mation mechanisms and sites within the respiratory tract ( Sect . II . D ) ( e . g . , Asadi et al . , 2019 ; Johnson and Morawska , 2009 ; Johnson et al . , 2011 ; Morawska et al . , 2009 ) . After emission and rapid evaporation ( Sect . II . C ) , the PSD determines the aerosol residence time and mo - bility in the air ( e . g . , Ng et al . , 2020 ) . The particle movement and transport through air is driven by mul - tiple forces , such as drag , inertial , electrostatic , radia - tive , gravitational , and thermophoretic forces , as well as Brownian motion and turbulent diﬀusion ( Hinds , 1999 ; Jayaweera et al . , 2020 ; Kulkarni et al . , 2011 ) . The inﬂu - ence of these forces strongly depends on the PSD and , thus , aﬀects transport over distances as well as either di - lution or potential enrichment under given air conditions ( Gregson et al . , 2021 ; Hinds , 1999 ; Lelieveld et al . , 2020 ) . Moreover , the PSD deﬁnes the ﬁltration eﬃciency of face masks ( upon both in - and exhalation ) as well as the de - position sites of particles in the upper respiratory tract ( URT ) and lower respiratory tract ( LRT ) ( see also Fig . 8 ) ( Drewnick et al . , 2020 ; Guzman , 2020 ) . The respiration PSDs have a characteristic multimodal shape ( Asadi et al . , 2019 ; Chao et al . , 2009 ; Han et al . , 2013 ; Johnson et al . , 2011 ; Morawska et al . , 2009 ; Pap - ineni and Rosenthal , 1997 ) . They can be described well by a multimode lognormal ﬁt function with n individual 9 TABLE I Parameters of diﬀerent respiratory activities / events , summarized from previous studies . The following events are speciﬁed : breathe ( event = one exhalation ) , speak ( event = one spoken word of average length ) , cough ( event = one cough ) , and sneeze ( event = one sneeze ) . Relevant event - speciﬁc parameters are the emitted air volume ( V air ) , duration ( ∆ t ) , and peak ﬂow rate ( q ) per event . Relevant time - averaged parameters are the event rate ( f ) , which is the number of event repetitions per hour , and the average air emission rate ( ˙ V ) , obtained through ˙ V = V air · f ( Tortora and Derrickson , 2017 ) . For speaking , two ( short ) words spoken per second were assumed to obtain a speaking - related f , according to Johnson et al . ( 2011 ) . Several parameters show an inherently high inter - and intrasubject variability , which is reﬂected in the table as typical parameter ranges . The values in brackets show the characteristic values used in calculations in this review article ( e . g . , Sect . III . C and Sect . III . D ) . Values represent the average of male and female adults . Values mostly represent healthy subjects – only for the cough rate , healthy and diseased subjects are distinguished .

In this study , f N ( D ) is given as d N / dlog D , which is broadly es - tablished in aerosol science . Thus , Equation 8 uses both , log and ln . To convert uniformly to log ( if preferred ) , ln ( D / D i ) can be replaced by 2 . 303 · log ( D / D i ) to make the equation uniform . For the multimodal lognormal ﬁt - ting , the smallest possible number of modes yielding a good representation of the experimental data is preferred . Ideally , the individual modes can be associated with the mechanisms and sites of speciﬁc emission processes in the respiratory tract . Equation 8 has been used through - out this work and in the parameterization present here . Note , that diﬀerent versions of lognormal ﬁt functions have been broadly used in aerosol studies and in the ﬁeld of respiratory aerosols in particular . As an alternative ex - ample , the following Eq . 9 from Heintzenberg ( 1994 ) has been used widely ( e . g . , Asadi et al . , 2019 ; Chao et al . , 2009 ; Han et al . , 2013 ; Johnson et al . , 2011 ; Morawska et al . , 2009 ) f H ( D ) = n (cid:88) i = 1 C i √ 2 π ln ( σ i ) exp   −   ln (cid:16) DD i (cid:17) √ 2 ln ( σ i )   2   ( 9 ) with D i as the mode mean geometric diameter as in Eq . ( 8 ) , C i as the integral particle number concentration of the mode , and σ i as the modal geometric standard de - viation . Importantly , both functions Eq . ( 8 ) and Eq . ( 9 ) yield the same ﬁtting results . They only diﬀer in the deﬁnition or meaning of the ﬁt parameters . Essentially all measurements of respiratory aerosols yield particle number size distributions ( NSDs ) as pri - mary data ( i . e . , number of counted particles in a given sequence of size bins ) . The NSDs can be converted in size distributions of the number emission rates ( Q N ) accord - ing to Eq . 5 and f from Table I . Further , the NSDs can be converted in particle volume size distributions ( VSDs ) 10 according to f V ( D ) = π 6 D 3 f N ( D ) ( 10 ) = π 6 D 3 · n (cid:88) i = 1 A i exp   −   ln (cid:16) DD i (cid:17) σ i   2   assuming a ( nearly ) spherical particle shape . Inconsistencies and deviations in the PSDs reported in published literature can presumably be explained by the highly dynamic properties of the respiratory parti - cle population , along with experimental challenges in its characterization ( e . g . , Johnson et al . , 2011 ; Nicas et al . , 2005 ; Xie et al . , 2009 ) . Moreover , many diﬀerent mea - surement techniques have been used , each of which can detect aerosol particles over a narrow band of the over - all PSD . To construct a PSD over the full range of par - ticle sizes emitted by human respiration ( < 10 nm to > 1000 µ m ) requires data from a set of instruments to be stitched together , each of which may use diﬀerent phys - ical parameters for detection ( i . e . , optical , aerodynamic , physical , or electric mobility sizing ) . The matching of PSDs using these diﬀerent techniques introduces addi - tional uncertainties to be considered in the interpreta - tion of those measurements ( Seinfeld and Pandis , 2016 ) . Section III follows up on this general overview of respira - tory particle NSDs and VSDs with a comprehensive sum - mary of the available literature and the development of an eﬃcient parameterization scheme , representing their characteristic multimodal shape . 3 . Size distributions of pathogens within respiratory particle populations The pathogen mixing state – which can be deﬁned in relation to Riemer et al . ( 2019 ) as the distribution of the pathogens across the carrier particle population – is of prime relevance for a mechanistic understanding of aerosolization , transport , and deposition ( Fennelly , 2020 ; Gralton et al . , 2011 ; Zuo et al . , 2020 ) . Small pathogens such as viruses are generally not emitted alone , but are embedded within ( much ) larger mucusalivary particles ( Fig . 3 ) ( Cox et al . , 2020 ) . Accordingly , the pathogen - mucusalivary aerosol can be generally considered as an internal mixture ( Jayaweera et al . , 2020 ; Riemer et al . , 2019 ; Santarpia et al . , 2020a ; Vejerano and Marr , 2018 ) . Note , however , that published data on the pathogen mix - ing state is sparse and microphysical details are widely unknown . For example , it is unknown whether small pathogens , such as virions , are located within the carrier particles or on their surface , which is relevant for their exposure to environmental conditions and , thus , their vi - ability ( e . g . , Pan et al . , 2019 ; Vejerano and Marr , 2018 ) . It is further unknown , whether respiratory particles hold one or more pathogen copies ( mono - vs poly - pathogen particles ) , which has implications for the assessment of infection risks ( Nordsiek et al . , 2021 ) . If a given type of pathogen were embedded in emit - ted particles at a consistent concentration , one would expect the number of , e . g . , virions to increase with par - ticle size , and thus the dose response might scale with the cumulative particle volume ( Fig . 3 ) . If , instead , the pathogen were embedded with a relatively constant num - ber of virions in a particular ( e . g . , smaller ) particle size fraction , the dose response would likely rather scale with the number of inhaled particles in this speciﬁc size range ( e . g . , a speciﬁc mode of the PSD ) . Size - resolved sam - pling and detection of airborne pathogens from infected individuals , which allows important conclusions on the mixing state , is however experimentally demanding and corresponding studies are therefore rare ( Roy and Mil - ton , 2004 ) . The answer may also be more complicated FIG . 3 Figure illustrates concepts of internal vs external mix - ing states in relation to pathogen distribution in mucusali - vary particle populations . It further emphasizes the diﬀer - ence between mono - and poly - pathogen particles ( e . g . , Nord - siek et al . , 2021 ) . Microscopy images adapted from Vejerano and Marr ( 2018 ) shows laboratory - generated virus - laden and internally mixed particles as surrogates for authentic respira - tory particles . Here , particles comprise salt , glycoprotein , sur - factant , and the well - studied Pseudomonas φ 6 virions . Green ﬂuorescence is associated with surfactants , which are assumed to partition to the φ 6 virions .

The existing studies – especially on M . tuberculosis ( Fen - nelly et al . , 2012 , 2004b ; Patterson et al . , 2018 ) , inﬂuenza virus ( Fabian et al . , 2008 ; Fennelly , 2020 ; Lednicky and Loeb , 2013 ; Li et al . , 2020 ; Lindsley et al . , 2012 ; Mil - ton et al . , 2013 ) , and SARS - CoV - 2 ( Chia et al . , 2020 ; Lednicky et al . , 2021 ; Liu et al . , 2020 ; Santarpia et al . , 2020a ) – suggest that pathogens are typically enriched in speciﬁc size ranges of the carrier PSD , likely deﬁned by the particle formation mechanisms and sites , in rela - tion to the site of infection ( see Sect . II . D ) . Furthermore , PSDs combined with the pathogen number density in mucusalivary particles determines the infection risk as - sociated with multi - pathogen aerosols , which has been recently addressed in a new dose - response model ( Nord - siek et al . , 2021 ) . Beyond the actually inhaled dose , the mixing state is further important for the dose - response relationship of a given pathogen . The size range of the carrier PSD in re - lation to its particle deposition properties deﬁnes which regions of the URT and LRT are reached . As diﬀerent deposition sites in the respiratory tract can show diﬀer - ent susceptibilities to a given pathogen , the dose - response can be size - dependent in terms of the inhaled PSD ( e . g . , Fennelly , 2020 ; Samet et al . , 2021 ; Teske et al . , 2014 ; Thomas , 2013 ) . Previous studies have shown clearly size - dependent infectivities for airborne inﬂuenza virions ( Nikitin et al . , 2014 ) as well as M . tuberculosis ( Sonkin , 1951 ; Wells , 1955 ) , both being signiﬁcantly more infec - tious if carried in smaller particles . Further , pathogen deposition in the LRT relative to the URT is often asso - ciated with higher severity , morbidity and fatality ( e . g . , Druett et al . , 1953 ; Gralton et al . , 2011 ; Matricardi et al . , 2020 ; Port et al . , 2020 ; Thomas , 2013 ; Zuo et al . , 2020 ) . Milton ( 2012 ) introduced the concept of anisotropic in - fection , emphasizing that the clinical severity of certain disease depend on the mode of acquisition . This means that diﬀerences in pathogen deposition site in the respi - ratory tract can be associated with dramatic diﬀerences in disease development , ranging from an acute disease response to a much milder course . 12 4 . Decay of pathogen viability in aerosol Another essential parameter in disease transmission through the aerosol route is the survival of the corre - sponding pathogens during airborne transport . The de - cline in the pathogen’s viability deﬁnes the lifetime of its infectious potential upon airborne transport and must be considered in infection control measures and risk as - sessments . The inactivation typically follows a ﬁrst - order exponential decay function N p ( t ) = N p , 0 exp ( − k t ) ( 11 ) with N p ( t ) as the number of airborne and viable pathogens at a given time t , N p , 0 as the initial number of viable pathogens at t = 0 , and k as the inactivation rate , which further gives the half - life as T 1 / 2 = ln 2 / k ( Hitchman , 2020 ; Knibbs et al . , 2014 ) . Various environ - mental factors , such as temperature , desiccation at low humidity , radiation , i . e . , ultraviolet light , and reactive gaseous species can damage the pathogens’ lipids , pro - teins , or nucleic acids and , thus inactivate them ( e . g . , Dabisch et al . , 2021 ; Fennelly , 2020 ; Leung , 2021 ; Niazi et al . , 2020 ; Pica and Bouvier , 2012 ) . An overview of the eﬀects of temperature and humidity on pathogen viabil - ity is provided by Tang ( 2009 ) . The pathogen viability further depends on the chemical microenvironment and , thus on ELF and saliva composition as well as water con - tent ( Niazi et al . , 2020 ; Vejerano and Marr , 2018 ) . For example , ELF and saliva can act as an organic barrier against environmental exposure after droplet desiccation . Typical half - lives ( T 1 / 2 ) for selected pathogens in aerosol are summarized in Table II . The variability in T 1 / 2 is large , and strongly enhanced decay rates were found , e . g . , for increased temperature and irradiance ( Dabisch et al . , 2021 ; Schuit et al . , 2020 ) . C . Hygroscopic growth and shrinkage of respiratory particles in relation to their chemical composition and hygroscopicity The composition of the exhaled mucosal ﬂuid droplets is complex , highly variable , and not well characterized ( Niazi et al . , 2020 ; Sarkar et al . , 2019 ) . In the respiratory tract and , thus also in freshly emitted droplets , the ﬂuids contain large mass fractions of water with > 99 % in saliva ( Humphrey and Williamson , 2001 ) and ∼ 95 % in ELF ( Bansil and Turner , 2006 ; Hamed and Fiegel , 2014 ) . Dis - solved in the water are various salts acting as electrolytes and buﬀers with sodium ( Na + ) , potassium ( K + ) , and cal - cium ( Ca 2 + ) as main cations as well as chloride ( Cl – ) , hydrogen carbonate ( HCO – 3 ) , and phosphates ( mainly H 2 PO – 4 and HPO 2 – 4 ) as major anions ( see Table III ) . Further , a broad variety of organic constituents is either dissolved or suspended in the water . This includes pro - teins for defensive purposes ( e . g . , lysozyme , immunoglob - ulins ) , glycoproteins responsible for the viscous and elas - tic gel - like properties of the ﬂuids ( i . e . , mucins ) , as well as further compounds such as lipids , surfactants ( i . e . , phospholipids ) , cholesterol , and urea ( Bansil and Turner , 2006 ) . For instance , Bredberg et al . ( 2012 ) detected more than 100 diﬀerent proteins in exhaled particle samples . Further , the ELF composition changes from the upper conducting airways towards the alveolar region ( Cross et al . , 1994 ; Holmgren et al . , 2011 ; Lakey et al . , 2016 ; Ni - azi et al . , 2020 ; van der Vliet and Cross , 2000 ) . Table III provides a general overview of the main constituents and speciﬁes typical concentration ranges , however , does not seek to resolve the entire chemical complexity or variabil - ity of the ﬂuids . The life cycle of the respiratory particles is very dy - namic ( Martin , 2000 ) . At the moment of exhalation , the particles are in a liquid state and can be regarded as droplets of mucosal ﬂuids . The warm ( ∼ 37 ℃ ) , water - saturated ( ∼ 100 % RH ) , and particle - laden air leaves the respiratory tract and typically experiences sudden changes in temperature and RH ( e . g . , Chaudhuri et al . , 2020a ; Chong et al . , 2021 ; Ng et al . , 2020 ) . A frequent scenario is the exhalation into subsaturated water va - por conditions ( i . e . , RH < 100 % ) , such as room air at typically 40 to 80 % RH ( e . g . , Chao et al . , 2009 ; Davies et al . , 2021 ; Drossinos and Stilianakis , 2020 ; Morawska et al . , 2009 ) . Under these conditions , the particles leave the respiratory tract at RH ≈ 100 % with an initial di - ameter ( D exh ) . In relation to the particle composition and the associated hygroscopicity , evaporation of water occurs fast ( i . e . , < 1 s ) and causes a substantial decrease in D ( Chaudhuri et al . , 2020b ; Davies et al . , 2021 ; Marr et al . , 2019 ; Wei and Li , 2015 ) . For complete evapora - tion , the droplets shrink completely to their dry diame - ter ( D dry ) deﬁned by the remaining nonvolatile solutes , whereas at typical intermediate RH levels the droplets shrink to an equilibrium ( wet ) diameter ( D wet ) ( Holm - gren et al . , 2011 ; Morawska et al . , 2009 ; Nicas et al . , 2005 ) . The ratio of the wet diameter as a function of RH ( D wet ( RH ) ) and the dry diameter ( D dry ) deﬁnes the particles’ growth factor ( g d ) as g d = D wet ( RH ) D dry . ( 12 ) The cube of g d gives the volume growth factor ( g V ) through g V = g 3d . Under certain conditions , such as dur - ing mixing of the respiratory puﬀ with cold and humid outdoor air , also supersaturated water vapor conditions ( i . e . , RH > 100 % ) can occur ( Chong et al . , 2021 ; Ng et al . , 2020 ) . Supersaturation can cause an initial and signiﬁcant growth of the droplets , as outlined in more detail below . 13 TABLE III Overview of main constituents in saliva and ELF .

( A ) Thermody - namic modeling : equilibrium diameters plotted against rela - tive humidity ( RH ) assuming diﬀerent initial diameters , D exh ( open circles ) , upon exhalation at 100 % RH . Steps near 50 % RH and 40 % RH correspond to eﬄorescence phase transi - tions of NaCl and KCl , respectively . ( B ) Kinetic modeling : droplet diameters plotted against time assuming diﬀerent ini - tial diameters D exh upon exhalation at 99 . 5 % RH into an environment at 55 % RH . Solid colored lines represent saliva proxy droplets with shadings indicating uncertainties related to diﬀerent diﬀusivity parameterizations for semisolid phase state (cid:46) 80 % RH . Dotted grey lines represent aqueous NaCl droplets for comparison . Grey squares and dashed grey line represent the characteristic time of evaporation t e ( e - folding time ) plotted as a function of initial particle diameter D exh . 14 Figure 4 illustrates the drying process for saliva proxy droplets consisting of an aqueous mixture of salts and protein . 1 It shows , that the droplets – after emission from the respiratory tract with RH ≈ 100 % into an environ - ment with RH < 100 % – shrink substantially in the ini - tial phase of drying . The shrinkage curve in Fig . 4A rep - resents thermodynamic equilibrium states , however , par - ticles might deviate from the equilibrium curve if changes in RH are rapid . A droplet’s evaporation time is roughly proportional to D 2exh ( Langmuir , 1918 ; Seinfeld and Pan - dis , 2016 ; Wells , 1934 ; Wells and Wells , 1936 ) according to D ( t ) 2 = D 2exh + 8 D g M w ρ w ( c g − c gs ) · t ( 13 ) in which D g is the diﬀusion coeﬃcient of water in the gas phase , M w the molar mass of water , and ρ w the density of water . Note that this classical so - called D 2 - law is based on the assumption of isolated , pure liquid droplets evap - orating into a homogeneous environment of a given RH ( Chong et al . , 2021 ) and holds for multi - component mix - tures only in the early stages of the evaporation process , when the diﬀerence between far - surface water concentra - tion and near - surface water concentration ( c g − c gs ) is approximately constant ( Kulmala et al . , 1993 ; Niimura and Hasegawa , 2019 ) . The drying dynamics of saliva proxy particles are il - lustrated in Fig 4B using calculations with the kinetic multi - layer model of gas - particle interactions in aerosols and clouds , KM - GAP ( Shiraiwa et al . , 2012 ) . Pro - cesses limiting particle evaporation are the gas - phase dif - fusion of water molecules away from the particle sur - face , heat transfer to the particle surface after evapo - rational cooling , and , potentially , bulk diﬀusion of wa - ter molecules through the partially dried - out salt - protein matrix . While small particles equilibrate on the millisec - ond time scale , large particles may take seconds to reach thermodynamic equilibrium , especially if the diﬀusion of water through the salt - protein matrix is slow . The shadings in Fig 4B illustrate the minor eﬀect of three diﬀerent diﬀusivity parameterizations ranging from fully liquid particles to particles undergoing a liquid - to - semisolid phase transition and signiﬁcant drop in wa - ter diﬀusivity between 75 and 80 % RH . 2 A Vignes - type 1 Saliva proxy comprises salts NaCl and KCl and protein bovine serum albumin , BSA , with volume fractions (cid:15) NaCl = 0 . 1 , (cid:15) KCl = 0 . 1 , (cid:15) BSA = 0 . 8 . BSA was chosen as proxy protein for complex protein mixture in real saliva ( compare TableIII ) . 2 Diﬀusivity parameterizations employed for the calculations in this study include ( i ) a constant diﬀusivity of water that would be expected in pure liquid water droplets D w = 1 × 10 − 5 cm 2 s − 1 ( lower boundaries in Fig . 4B ) ; ( ii ) a Vignes - type mixing rule ( Vignes , 1966 ) D w = D x w w , w · D 1 − x w w , s between pure liquid water diﬀusing at D w , w = 1 × 10 − 5 cm 2 s − 1 ) and water in a semisolid salt - protein matrix diﬀusing at D w , s = 1 × 10 − 10 cm 2 s − 1 ( solid mixing rule between liquid water and a semi - solid salt - protein matrix yielded near identical results to the fully liquid scenario . The grey dotted lines in Fig . 4B show the correspond - ing drying dynamics of pure NaCl solution droplets , as shown previously and in good agreement with other mod - elling approaches ( Davies et al . , 2021 ) . The KM - GAP model returns near - identical evaporation speeds for saliva proxy and NaCl particles . 3 Due to the consumption of latent heat during evaporation , particles cool to a min - imum temperature of ∼ 291 . 7 K , irrespective of initial particle size . This temperature lies close to the wet bulb temperature , which is the lower limit at which net evap - oration can still take place under the given ambient con - ditions . The grey squares and dashed grey line in Fig . 4B rep - resent the characteristic e - folding time of evaporation t e , which is the time needed for a droplet to shrink by a factor of 1 / e relative to its initial size D exh : t e = D 2exh · (cid:0) e − 2 − 1 (cid:1) ρ w 8 D g M w ( c g − c gs ) ( 14 ) It exhibits a D 2 - dependence analogous to the droplet evaporation rate ( Eq . 13 ) , which applies as long as the evaporation kinetics are governed by gas diﬀusion ( rather than bulk diﬀusion or phase transitions ) . A comparison of these evaporation times with the sedi - mentation times of larger respiratory droplets – as shown in Fig . 2 – reveals that the largest droplets ( i . e . , ∼ 100 µ m and larger ) may settle too fast to reach an equilibrium state with the ambient RH ( Ai and Melikov , 2018 ; Niazi et al . , 2020 ; Nicas et al . , 2005 ; Wei and Li , 2015 ) and can stay in a water - rich state over their entire lifetime . Chong et al . ( 2021 ) further showed that the inﬂuence of the local RH ﬁeld around the droplets in the exhaled hu - mid puﬀs has to be considered as it tends to delay the evaporation signiﬁcantly ( i . e . , factor 30 or even larger ) . In this sense , the calculations in Fig . 4B ( assuming an instantaneous change in environment RH to 55 % ) rep - resent lower limits of the evaporation times ( or upper limits for the equilibration rate / speed ) of characteristic droplet sizes without the inﬂuence of the surrounding puﬀ of humid exhalation air ( de Rivas and Villermaux , 2016 ; Villermaux et al . , 2017 ) . Figure 4A suggests a shrinkage factor of D exh / D dry ≈ 4 . 5 for complete drying of saliva as well as D exh / D wet ≈ 4 lines in Fig . 4B ) ; ( iii ) percolation theory ( Murata et al . , 1999 ; Shante and Kirkpatrick , 1971 ; Shiraiwa et al . , 2011 ) assuming a coordination number of Z = 4 , a packing fraction f = 0 . 95 and values for D w , w and D w , s as deﬁned above ( upper boundaries in Fig . 4B ) . 3 Water activity parameterizations for NaCl particles were ob - tained using the Extended Aerosol Inorganics Model ( E - AIM ) ( Clegg et al . , 1998 ) , water activity in saliva particles was param - eterized according to the ZSR model presented in Fig . 5B . 15 for drying to typical room RH levels ( i . e . , ∼ 40 to ∼ 80 % RH ) . This is consistent with the shrinkage expected based on typical salt concentrations in saliva ( Table III ) : the drying of a saline solution with ∼ 1 % NaCl ( a typical value for saliva , from Humphrey and Williamson , 2001 ) would result in g d ≈ 6 . In previous studies on respiratory particles , estimates or measurements of g d ranged from ∼ 2 and ∼ 6 ( e . g . , Chaudhuri et al . , 2020b ; Davies et al . , 2021 ; Duguid , 1946 ; Holmgren et al . , 2011 ; Marr et al . , 2019 ; Niazi et al . , 2020 ; Nicas et al . , 2005 ; Stadnytskyi et al . , 2020 ; Tang et al . , 2021 ; Wei and Li , 2015 ) . The hygroscopic growth and shrinkage of the respira - tory particles can be calculated by the K¨ohler theory , which describes thermodynamic water equilibrium states between the gas and aqueous phases ( K¨ohler , 1936 ) . Speciﬁcally , it describes the interplay of the enhancement in water saturation vapor pressure ( p 0 ) over a curved relative to a ﬂat surface and the reduction in p 0 over a solute surface relative to pure water . The K¨ohler theory has been broadly applied in atmospheric research as it al - lows to describe and model the water uptake and loss by ambient aerosol particles under variable RH conditions ( Seinfeld and Pandis , 2016 ) . It has been particularly im - portant to describe the nucleation of cloud droplets by ambient aerosol particles ( Andreae and Rosenfeld , 2008 ) . The corresponding K¨ohler equation s = a w Ke ( 15 ) with Ke = exp (cid:18) 4 σ sol M w R T ρ w D wet (cid:19) expresses the necessary conditions for an aqueous solu - tion droplet to be in equilibrium state with the water va - por of the surrounding gas . Speciﬁcally , it relates the wa - ter vapor saturation ratio ( s ) to the Raoult term , which is the water activity in the aqueous solution ( a w ) and describes the size and composition dependencies of the droplet’s solute eﬀect , as well as the Kelvin term ( Ke ) , which describes the increase in equilibrium water vapor pressure due to droplet’s surface curvature ( K¨ohler , 1936 ; Seinfeld and Pandis , 2016 ) . In Ke , σ sol is the solution droplet’s surface tension , M w is the molar weight of wa - ter , ρ w is the water density , R is the universal gas con - stant , T is the absolute temperature , and D wet ( RH ) is the droplet diameter at a given s or RH , with s = RH / 100 % ( Seinfeld and Pandis , 2016 ) . The eﬀect of droplet curva - ture becomes important for D wet < 0 . 1 µ m ( Eq . 16 ) . Diﬀerent approximations and parameterizations exist to describe a w and σ sol as a function of the droplet’s chemical composition as outlined systematically in Rose et al . ( 2008 ) . Typically , σ sol is approximated by the sur - face tension of pure water . A commonly used parameter - ization of a w is based on the hygroscopicity parameter , κ , introduced by Petters and Kreidenweis ( 2007 ) according FIG . 5 Hygroscopic growth curves as a function of RH ( up to 99 . 5 % ) for the reference compounds NaCl , KCl , and protein ( BSA ) ( A ) as well as for authentic saliva ( B , C ) , showing a hysteresis shape in growth factor g d with deliquescence and ef - ﬂorescence phase transitions . Panel ( C ) shows the volume hy - groscopic growth factor ( g V ) corresponding to g d in ( B ) . The modelled data ( solid and dashed lines ) for pure compounds and saliva proxy system ( with volume fractions (cid:15) NaCl = 0 . 1 , (cid:15) KCl = 0 . 1 , (cid:15) BSA = 0 . 8 ) were obtained from the Aerosol In - organic Model ( AIM ) ( Clegg et al . , 1998 ) and the Aerosol Inorganic - Organic Mixtures Functional groups Activity Coef - ﬁcients ( AIOMFAC ) models ( Zuend et al . , 2008 ) ( Jing et al . , 2017 ; Mikhailov and Vlasenko , 2020 ) . The experimental data ( circular markers ) in ( B ) were obtained from high humid - ity tandem diﬀerential mobility analyser ( HHTDMA ) analy - sis according to Mikhailov and Vlasenko ( 2020 ) for stimulated saliva from three healthy , non - smoking individuals . 16 to a w = (cid:18) 1 + κ V s V w (cid:19) − 1 ( 16 ) with V as the volumes of the dry solute ( s ) and pure water ( w ) . The parameter κ reﬂects the chemical com - position of the solutes in the droplets . It is widely used in atmospheric aerosol research ( e . g . , Mikhailov et al . , 2013 ; Paramonov et al . , 2013 ; P¨ohlker et al . , 2018 ) and ( for ambient aerosol samples ) typically ranges from ∼ 0 . 1 for organic solutes to ∼ 0 . 9 for salts ( Andreae and Rosen - feld , 2008 ) . According to Rose et al . ( 2008 ) and Petters and Kreidenweis ( 2007 ) , κ can be related to fundamental properties of the water and solute as well as the solute’s dissociation behavior through κ = i s n s V w n w V s = i s ρ s M w ρ w M s with i s ≈ ν s Φ s ( 17 ) with n as the numbers of moles , ρ as the densities , and M as molar masses of the dry solutes ( s ) and pure water ( w ) as well as the van’t Hoﬀ factor of the solute ( i s ) with ν s as the stoichiometric dissociation number and Φ s as the molar osmotic coeﬃcient in aqueous solution . To calculate κ based on g d , it is convenient to transform Eq . 16 into κ = ( g V − 1 ) ( 1 − a w ) a w . ( 18 ) Figure 5A shows the modelled hygroscopic growth and shrinkage of pure 100 nm NaCl and KCl particles , which are both main constituents of saliva ( Table III ) . Both salts show a pronounced hysteresis in g d with sharp phase transitions at their deliquescence and eﬄorescence rel - ative humidities ( DRH and ERH ) . For increasing RH starting from dry particles ( i . e . , < ERH ) , a sudden del - iquescence phase transition occurs at DRH ≈ 75 % for NaCl and at DRH ≈ 85 % for KCl . In the course of the drying from RH > DRH , the eﬄorescence phase transi - tions occur at ERH ≈ 40 % for NaCl and at ERH ≈ 50 % for KCl ( Li et al . , 2014 ) . Further shown in Fig . 5A is the hygroscopic growth curve of BSA as a proxy for the complex protein mixture in ELF and saliva . The pro - tein ( as well as organic compounds in general ) shows a signiﬁcantly lower g d than the salts and is further char - acterized by the absence of a hysteresis ( Estillore et al . , 2017 ; Mikhailov et al . , 2009 ) . The experimental g d data points for BSA originate from Mikhailov et al . ( 2004 ) and were ﬁtted by a polynomial three - parameter function ac - cording to Kreidenweis et al . ( 2005 ) as follows g d = (cid:20) 1 + (cid:0) k 1 + k 2 s + k 3 s 2 (cid:1) s 1 − s (cid:21) 1 / 3 ( 19 ) using k 1 = 0 . 111 , k 2 = 0 . 0239 , and k 3 = − 0 . 131 , which yields a good ﬁt with R 2 = 0 . 953 . FIG . 6 Hygroscopic growth behavior , represented by growth factor g d , for the reference compounds NaCl , KCl , and the protein bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) under supersaturated water vapor conditions . Mikhailov et al . ( 2009 ) generally deﬁned deliquescence as a transformation of a solid or semisolid substance into a liquid aqueous solution , with gas phase water being absorbed – also called liquefaction / liquescence upon hu - midiﬁcation / hydration . Eﬄorescence is a transformation of a substance from a liquid aqueous solution into a ( semi - ) solid phase upon water evaporation – also called solidi - ﬁcation upon drying / dehydration . Below DRH , the dis - solved salts in the particles are supersaturated until the eﬄorescence phase transition occurs , which is a kinet - ically limited , homogeneous nucleation process and de - pends on particle size as well as impurities ( Gao et al . , 2007 ; Laskina et al . , 2015 ) . Accordingly , for NaCl – as a main constituent in saliva – a range of ERH values from 37 to 50 % has been reported ( Laskina et al . , 2015 ; Mar - tin , 2000 ; Mikhailov et al . , 2004 , and references therein ) . Figure 5A and C show the NaCl ERH at ∼ 40 % , which is at the lower end of the aforementioned RH range . DRH values > 50 % are commonly attributed to heterogeneous nucleation due to the presence of impurities ( Lightstone et al . , 2000 ; Mikhailov et al . , 2004 ; Tang and Munkelwitz , 1994 ) . Figure 6 relates to Fig . 5A and shows the modelled be - havior of g d beyond water saturation into the supersatu - rated regime . Under certain conditions , such as breath - ing into cold and humid air , the respiratory particles can experience an episodic occurrence of supersaturated con - ditions ( Ng et al . , 2020 ) . Figure 6 shows that as long as the supersaturated conditions prevail , the exhaled parti - cles might grow substantially before the onset of droplet drying in the course of dilution and dissipation of the exhaled puﬀs . As a prediction of the expected hygroscopic behavior of saliva , the three - compound system with the main con - 17 stituents NaCl , KCl , and BSA was modelled and is shown in Fig . 5B . The overall g d of multi - compound systems can usually be approximated accurately as the additive inﬂu - ence of the g d , i from the individual compounds i as well as their corresponding volume fractions (cid:15) i in the mixture g d = (cid:32)(cid:88) i (cid:15) i g d , i 3 (cid:33) 13 and (cid:15) i = V s i V s ( 20 ) with V s i as the volume of the individual components and V s as the total particle volume . This approach is based on the Zdanovskii—Stokes—Robinson ( ZSR ) model , which assumes independent water uptake of individual compo - nents in mixtures ( Stokes and Robinson , 1966 ) . The resulting g d of the NaCl - KCl - BSA system in Fig . 5B is characterized by a hysteresis with two subse - quent deliquescence phase transitions , reﬂecting the in - ﬂuence of both salts . These model predictions were com - pared to the results of a ’proof - of - concept’ hygroscopic - ity measurement of authentic saliva and the correspond - ing data points were added to Fig . 5B . 4 The model and experimental results agree remarkably well , despite the fact that the NaCl - KCl - BSA system largely simpliﬁes the chemical complexity of real saliva . The experimental re - sults further underline that a hysteresis in the g d and g V curves can generally be expected in the hygroscopic be - havior of saliva – and presumably also of ELF as both ﬂu - ids are characterized by similar salt concentrations ( Ta - ble III ) . Hygroscopic growth curves for a simulated ELF system with DRH ∼ 70 % and ERH ∼ 50 % were recently reported by Davies et al . ( 2021 ) , which are largely con - sistent with Fig . 5B . Note in this context that the ERH of the saliva at ∼ 38 % is lower than the eﬄorescence RH of the constituents NaCl and KCl at ∼ 41 % and ∼ 52 % ( Fig . 5C ) . This can be explained by a suppression of the eﬄorescence phase transition by organic compounds and a corresponding shift of the ERH of the salts to lower values ( Mikhailov et al . , 2004 , and references therein ) . 4 The experimental proof - of - concept data in Fig . 5B were obtained from high humidity tandem diﬀerential mobility analyser ( HHT - DMA ) analysis in the RH range from 2 to 99 . 5 % according to Mikhailov and Vlasenko ( 2020 ) for stimulated saliva from three healthy , non - smoking individuals . The collected saliva was di - luted ( 1ml aliquot from each sample mixed with 75ml of pure water ) , ﬁltered through a 5 µ m syringe ﬁlter ( 25 mm GD / X , ster - ile , 6901 - 2504 , GE Healthcare Life Science , Whatman ) , and neb - ulized for HHTDMA analysis . The HHTDMA procedure and data analysis is outlined in detail in Mikhailov and Vlasenko ( 2020 ) and Mikhailov et al . ( 2020 ) . Brieﬂy , three operation modes are available for the HHTDMA instrument : a restruc - turing mode , a hydration mode , and a dehydration mode . The restructuring mode was used to specify the optimal RH range , in which initially irregular particles transform into compact spheri - cal particles . In hygroscopic growth experiments , the restructur - ing mode was coupled in - situ with a conventional hydration or dehydration mode . FIG . 7 Hygroscopicity parameter κ in high RH regime obtained for dried and size - selected ( ∼ 100 nm ) saliva par - ticles based on HHTDMA measurements ( see Fig . 5B ) . Or - ange shading indicates uncertainty in κ through error prop - agation as outline in Mikhailov and Vlasenko ( 2020 ) . Gray background shading > 92 % RH with increasing κ values sug - gests that particles underwent liquid - liquid phase separation ( LLPS ) . The occurrence of a hysteresis in g d has been dis - cussed as a presumably important microphysical process in respiratory particles that can aﬀect the viability of em - bedded pathogens ( e . g . , Niazi et al . , 2020 ; Vejerano and Marr , 2018 ) . A hysteresis entails a ’bistability’ in the humidity dependence within the intermediate humidity range ERH < RH < DRH , which corresponds to typi - cal indoor RH levels ( i . e , ∼ 40 to ∼ 80 % ) ( Niazi et al . , 2021 ) . If the particles are dried from RH > DRH , they shrink upon continuous evaporative water loss and retain a certain amount of water in a metastable salt supersat - uration state until the ERH is reached . If the particles are humidiﬁed from RH < ERH , they remain as dried residues until the DRH is reached . This means that for ERH < RH < DRH , the pathogen - laden particles can be either dried residues or contain a certain amount of water , depending on the ’history’ of RH change . It has been proposed that this eﬀect might help to explain con - ﬂicting observations on pathogen survival in relation to RH ( e . g . , Niazi et al . , 2021 , 2020 ) . A further result of the saliva measurement is the RH - dependence of κ in the high humidity regime calculated with Eq . ( 18 ) as shown in Fig . 7 . A declining trend in κ was observed < 92 % RH , followed by a sudden increase > 92 % RH . Liu et al . ( 2018 ) and Mikhailov et al . ( 2020 ) reported very similar results for atmospherically relevant purely organic as well as mixed organic - inorganic aerosol particles . Both studies explained the increasing κ for high RH with occurrence of liquid - liquid phase separa - tion ( LLPS ) in the particles , which was found to be a common and important micro - physical process in atmo - 18 spheric aerosols ( e . g . , Bertram et al . , 2011 ; Renbaum - Wolﬀ et al . , 2016 ; Song et al . , 2017 , 2012 ) . This suggests that LLPS might also be a characteristic phenomenon in saliva and ELF , again with potentially important impli - cations for pathogen viability ( Niazi et al . , 2020 ; Vejerano and Marr , 2018 ) . D . Formation mechanisms and sites of respiratory particles Knowledge of the formation mechanisms of human - expired particles and the corresponding sites in the respi - ratory tract is essential for a mechanistic understanding of airborne pathogen transmission ( e . g . , Dhand and Li , 2020 ; Gralton et al . , 2011 ; Johnson et al . , 2011 ; Patter - son and Wood , 2019 ; Wilson et al . , 2020 , and references therein ) . Generally , the formation is driven by a com - plex combination of shear and ﬁlm rupture instabilities , ejecting parts of the mucosalivary ﬁlms that cover the air - facing surfaces of the respiratory tract ( Bourouiba , 2020a ; Grotberg , 2001 ; Seminara et al . , 2020 ) . These processes are complex as they depend on a variety of fac - tors , such as respiratory activities ( e . g . , breathe , speak , and cough ) , geometries and movements of the air - ﬂuid interfaces in the respiratory tract , as well as composi - tion and viscoelastic properties of the mucosalivary ﬂuids ( e . g . , Anwarul Hasan et al . , 2010 ; Dhand and Li , 2020 ) . The formation site largely deﬁnes the composition of ex - haled particles , comprising a variable mixture of ELF from the LRT and saliva from the URT ( see Sect . II . C ) . Moreover , pathogens preferentially colonize certain re - gions of the airways ( e . g . , van Riel et al . , 2007 ; Shinya et al . , 2006 ) . Thus , expiration particles may carry par - ticularly high pathogen loads if the site of infection is the same or very close to the site of particle formation ( Gralton et al . , 2011 ; Patterson and Wood , 2019 ) . The four particle formation mechanisms and associated sites outlined below and summarized in Fig . 8 are widely dis - cussed and considered as most relevant . 1 . Bronchiole ﬂuid ﬁlm burst mechanism The bronchiole ﬂuid ﬁlm burst ( BFFB ) mechanism – or bronchiolar particle generation – is illustrated in Fig . 8E . It produces comparatively small particles ( < 1 µ m ) from collapsing liquid ﬁlms ( deep ) in the lungs ( Johnson and Morawska , 2009 ; Scheuch , 2020 ; Schwarz et al . , 2020 ) . During exhalation , the airways partly close , which refers to a compression and an associated blockage of air pas - sage when the airway walls get in contact ( Holmgren et al . , 2010 ) . Figure 9 shows conceptually the breath - ing patterns that involve the BFFB process . Closure begins in the lower lungs and progresses toward the up - per lung regions with decreasing lung volume ( Dollfuss et al . , 1967 ; Holmgren et al . , 2013 ) . During ( e . g . , normal tidal ) breathing , the terminal bronchioles are considered as the primary site of airway closure . During the subse - quent inhalation , the bronchioles reopen and ﬁlms of the ELF are spanned across the passages , forming a blockage of liquid menisci ( Holmgren et al . , 2013 ) . When these ﬁlms rupture , small particles form similar to soap ﬁlm droplets ( Lhuissier and Villermaux , 2009 ; Prather et al . , 2013 ) . These particles are ﬁrst drawn into the alveoli and subsequently exhaled , which explains why the concen - trations of emitted particles increase towards the end of an individual expiration ( Holmgren et al . , 2013 ; Schwarz et al . , 2010 ) . Exhaled particle concentrations ( C N ) de - crease upon breath holding at high lung volume due to diﬀusion and sedimentation losses in the alveoli , whereas concentrations increase upon breath holding at low lung volume due to a closure of more and more bronchioles with breath holding time ( Fabian et al . , 2011 ; Holmgren et al . , 2013 ; Johnson and Morawska , 2009 ; Schwarz et al . , 2015 ) . The BFFB particle formation can be modulated by diﬀerent breathing patterns , with the C N of exhaled par - ticles scaling proportionally to the fraction of fully con - tracted bronchioles ( Almstrand et al . , 2010 ; Fabian et al . , 2011 ; Haslbeck et al . , 2010 ; Holmgren et al . , 2013 , 2010 ; Johnson et al . , 2011 ) . Especially exhalation below func - tional residual capacity ( FRC ) is related to airway clo - sure and enhanced particle emission ( Schwarz et al . , 2010 ; Tortora and Derrickson , 2017 ) . Schwarz et al . ( 2010 ) showed that the C N is related to the ventilation ratio V B / V VC through C N = C T exp (cid:18) b V B V VC (cid:19) ( 21 ) with V B as the breathed air volume , V VC as the vital ca - pacity ( Fig . 9 , C T as the particle number concentration during low - volume tidal breathing , and b as an empirical factor representing the shape of exponential function and typically ranging between 4 to 12 ( Schwarz et al . , 2010 ) . The ventilation ratio for ’normal’ tidal breathing corre - sponds to ∼ 0 . 2 and approximates unity for airway closure breathing patterns . Further , Schwarz et al . ( 2010 ) found a large intersubject variability in contrast to a high re - producibility in C N for the same individual and suggested that the properties of the BFFB particle emissions can serve as a ﬁngerprint for the actual individual lung status . The BFFB particle production is active upon breathing and , therefore , also involved in all other respiratory ac - tivities ( e . g . , speak , cough ) ( Johnson et al . , 2011 ) . Thus , BFFB particle production is considered as potentially im - portant for airborne pathogen transmission from symp - tomatic as well as presymptomatic , asymptomatic , and paucisymptomatic infected individuals ( e . g . , Dhand and Li , 2020 ; Scheuch , 2020 ) . 19 FIG . 8 Conceptual scheme summarizing particle formation mechanisms and sites ( B – E ) in human respiratory tract ( A ) . Scheme emphasizes the subdivision into the upper respiratory tract ( URT ) or extrathoracic airways , reaching from larynx to mouth and nose , vs the lower respiratory tract ( LRT ) or tracheobronchial airways , including trachea , bronchi , bronchioles , and alveoli . Note that the four particle formation categories ( B – E ) are distinguished in the literature and also here primarily by production sites , whereas the production mechanisms are governed by the same few ﬂuid mechanical principles .

High - speed and turbulent airﬂows and airway compression and vibration Gas - ﬂuid interactions and especially turbulence in - duced instabilities at the air - mucus interface ( two ﬂu - ids streaming at largely diﬀerent speeds relative to each other ) have been discussed widely as particle generation mechanisms , especially for short and vigorous exspira - tions such as coughing and sneezing ( e . g . , Dhand and Li , 2020 ; Fontes et al . , 2020 ; Holmgren et al . , 2010 ; Moriarty and Grotberg , 1999 ; Patterson and Wood , 2019 ; Wilson et al . , 2020 ) . The central airways , such as the trachea and main bronchi , with their high - speed and often turbulent air ﬂows are considered as the region , where this process is assumed to be most pronounced , whereas air ﬂows in the small airways are mostly laminar due to the strong in - crease in cross - sectional area ( Dhand and Li , 2020 ; Hinds , 1999 ; Holmgren et al . , 2010 ; Johnson and Morawska , 2009 ; Patterson and Wood , 2019 ) . In such high - speed air - ﬂows , the associated interfacial shearing causes Kelvin - Helmholtz instabilities as interfacial waves of mucus with increasing amplitude ( Fig . 8D ) . Eventually small droplets are torn oﬀ the crest of these waves or ﬁlaments of mucus are drawn thin and fragmented into droplets ( Plateau - Rayleigh instability ) ( Dhand and Li , 2020 ; Seminara et al . , 2020 ) . The critical air speed , which created in - stabilities at the ELF - air interface is deﬁned by the ELF layer thickness ( typically 5 − 10 µ m ( Seminara et al . , 2020 ) ) , along with its viscoelastic properties and surface tension ( Anwarul Hasan et al . , 2010 ; Dhand and Li , 2020 ; Moriarty and Grotberg , 1999 ) . Furthermore , dynamic compression and vibration of the airways ”squeezes and loosens mucus and promotes expulsion of foreign mate - rial from the airways” ( Dhand and Li , 2020 ) . For breath - 20 FIG . 9 Conceptual ﬁgure showing breathing patterns , includ - ing ’normal’ tidal breathing ( corresponding to tidal volume ) as well as deep inhalations and exhalations . Similar repre - sentations for a variety of breathing patterns can be found in previous studies ( e . g . , Almstrand et al . , 2010 ; Holmgren et al . , 2013 ; Patterson and Wood , 2019 ) . related emissions , the turbulence - induced aerosolization has been excluded as a relevant mechanism since varia - tions in ﬂow rates had essentially no inﬂuence on droplet emissions ( Johnson and Morawska , 2009 ; Schwarz et al . , 2010 ) . 3 . Larynx with vocal folds adduction and vibration Vocal folds adduction and vibration within the larynx – or laryngeal particle generation – is regarded as rele - vant mechanism during coughing and sneezing as well as during vocalizations such as speaking and singing ( Asadi et al . , 2019 ) ( Fig . 8B ) . It has been suggested that the narrowing of the mucus - bathed folds forms a ﬂow restric - tion , in which a high - speed air - stream caused suﬃcient shear stress at the ELF - air interface to tear oﬀ droplets ( Dhand and Li , 2020 ) . Additionally , vigorous vibration and energetic movement of the ELF - coated folds during vocalization may create instabilities in the ELF surface layer and result in particle formation ( Morawska et al . , 2009 ; Moriarty and Grotberg , 1999 ) . It has been fur - ther considered that – similar to the BFFB mechanism – ELF ﬁlms may form and burst or ELF ﬁlaments may fragment in the open - close cycling of the glottic struc - ture ( i . e . , the opening between the vocal folds ) ( Asadi et al . , 2019 ; Johnson et al . , 2011 ; Patterson and Wood , 2019 ; Wilson et al . , 2020 ) . Some studies suggest that the vocalization frequency ( vocal pitch ) modulates the par - ticles’ emission rate and diameters ( Asadi et al . , 2019 ; Morawska et al . , 2009 ) . 4 . Oral cavity with mouth , lips , and tongue movements The upper respiratory tract , and particularly the oral cavity between lips and epiglottis as well as nasal passage , is regarded as the main site for large droplet formation ( Abkarian et al . , 2020 ) . Here , droplets through fragmen - tation of liquid sheets and ﬁlamentous structures that are formed from the permanently present saliva in the course of mouth , lips , and tongue movements ( Fig . 8C ) ( Johnson et al . , 2011 ; Seminara et al . , 2020 ) . Also pulsed and high velocity air ﬂows , such as coughing and sneez - ing , cause signiﬁcant shear forces in the throat , nasal and buccal passages , creating a droplet spray through Kelvin - Helmholtz instabilities ( Fontes et al . , 2020 ) . The velocity and pressure ﬁelds involved strongly depend on anatomy of the airﬂow passages as well as the chemical and ﬂuid properties of the saliva ( Fontes et al . , 2020 ) . 5 . Clinical aerosol - generating procedures So - termed ”aerosol - generating procedures” ( AGPs ) , e . g . intubation or high ﬂow nasal oxygen treatments , are clinical procedures that are labeled as such , because they can emit aerosols from the patient Klompas et al . ( 2021 ) . Aerosols can be generated from the nose , mouth , throat , or lungs from a patient undergoing various kinds of inva - sive procedures . From a clinical perspective , these AGPs have often been considered the one of the only sources of infectious aerosols from patients with most respiratory diseases , including COVID - 19 . The distinction is vitally important , because protective guidelines are often very diﬀerent for situations when healthcare workers expect to deal with AGPs versus every other situation . When aerosols are present that could contain pathogens , pro - tective equipment ( e . g . masks , respirators , eye coverings ) need to be signiﬁcantly improved to reduce inhalation of small airborne particles ( i . e . FFP2 or N95 respirators ) . Thus , surgical - style procedure masks and face shields are not suﬃcient protection whenever aerosols are present , and so healthcare workers can be left at risk . A survey of AGPs and the physical properties of aerosols emitted by these procedures will not be discussed here , in large part because AGPs have been shown to generally pro - duce fewer aerosols than standard respiratory activities like breathing , speaking , and coughing ( e . g . , Brown et al . , 2021 ; Hamilton et al . , 2021 ; Wilson et al . , 2021 ) . 21 III . MULTIMODAL SIZE DISTRIBUTIONS OF HUMAN RESPIRATORY PARTICLES AND ITS PARAMETERIZATION A . Literature data synthesis and development of a parameterization scheme Published , peer - reviewed studies with size distribution data on human respiratory particles along with informa - tion on sampling conditions and parameters have been collected and summarized in Table IV . The PSDs from the individual studies have been either obtained from data tables , if available , or have been digitized from ﬁg - ures . Table IV summarizes all studies with PSDs that were found . Since not all of them were equally appro - priate for the development of a general parmetrization , the following ﬂags specify in Table IV to what extent the individual studies were used : • A : The study was used in the literature and data synthesis . The reported PSDs agree with the over - all parameterization . The size resolution of the re - ported PSDs is suﬃciently high and allows a multi - modal ﬁtting with comparatively low uncertainty . The reported PSDs were further used to calculate the average parameterizations in Fig . 18 and aver - aged ﬁt parameters in Table VI . • B : The study was used in the literature and data synthesis of this work for comparison only . The reported PSDs agree with the overall parameteri - zation . The size resolution of the reported PSDs is comparatively low and ﬁtting entailed rather high uncertainties . Therefore , the reported PSDs were not used to calculate the average parameterizations in Fig . 18 and averaged ﬁt parameters in Table VI . • C : The corresponding study was not used in the literature and data synthesis of this work . The study was omitted for at least one of the following reasons : ( i ) data points from the original publica - tion could not be unambiguously digitized ( M¨urbe et al . , 2020 ; Papineni and Rosenthal , 1997 ) ; ( ii ) im - portant information for the calculation of concen - trations from the PSDs was missing ( Han et al . , 2013 ; Smith et al . , 2020 ) , or ( iii ) fundamental open questions on the methodology or experimental lim - itations remained ( Yang et al . , 2007 ) . Diﬀerent instruments and measurements strategies for respiratory aerosol characterization have been applied with speciﬁc strengths and limitations and were criti - cally evaluated here . Moreover , the individual studies typically cover only part of the entire aerosol size range . The characterization of the comparatively low concen - trations of respiratory aerosols requires online or oﬄine techniques that provide full size distributions , ideally also at high time resolution ( up to 1 Hz ) . The most commonly applied online instruments are the scanning mobility par - ticle sizer ( SMPS , manufactured by TSI Inc . , St . Paul , MN , USA ) with a nominal size range typically from 0 . 01 to 0 . 4 µ m , the aerodynamic particle sizer ( APS , TSI Inc . ) with a nominal size range from 0 . 5 to 20 µ m , and the optical particle sizer / counter ( OPS / OPC , from diﬀerent manufacturers ) with a nominal size range typically from 0 . 3 to 10 µ m . For larger particle fractions ( i . e . , > 10 µ m ) , passive sampling through particle sedimentation or im - paction of expelled droplets ( often called droplet deposi - tion analysis , DDA ) or active sampling through droplet impaction on solid surfaces ( e . g . , glass slides or culture plates ) followed by image analysis have been used . The APS has been a widely used instrument in respi - ratory aerosol characterization ( e . g . , Asadi et al . , 2019 ; Gregson et al . , 2021 ; Johnson and Morawska , 2009 ; John - son et al . , 2011 ; Morawska et al . , 2009 ) . Diﬀerent models of the APS have been used ( see Table IV ) . However , a va - riety of instrumental issues have been reported for diﬀer - ent APS models and , thus caution is required when using APS - derived size distributions ( Armendariz and Leith , 2002 ; Peters and Leith , 2003 ; Pfeifer et al . , 2016 ; Volck - ens and Peters , 2005 ) . While the sizing accuracy of the APS is generally acceptable , issues with the counting eﬃ - ciency and instrument’s unit - to - unit variability in certain size ranges have been reported ( Peters and Leith , 2003 ; Pfeifer et al . , 2016 ) . Generally , Peters and Leith ( 2003 ) showed that the counting eﬃciency can be strongly size - depend and varies between diﬀerent APS models . Par - ticularly relevant for the characterization of expiration aerosols upon release – which means in humid state – is a substantially decreased counting eﬃciency of liquid parti - cles ( i . e . , declining from 75 % at 0 . 8 µ m to 25 % for 10 µ m ) due to impaction losses in the instrument’s ﬂow system ( Volckens and Peters , 2005 ) . Pfeifer et al . ( 2016 ) recently showed a strongly increased unit - to - unit variability ( up to 60 % ) for particles smaller 0 . 9 µ m and larger 3 µ m , probably due to diﬀerent detector sensitivities . Here we have chosen a conservative approach and limited the size range of reported APS data to the relatively narrow band from 0 . 9 µ m to 5 µ m , where the counting eﬃciency is rel - atively high and unit - to - unit variability relatively low . Note in this context that Martin et al . ( 2010 ) also re - ported a decline in APS counting eﬃciency for ambient aerosols ( relative to an OPC ) and limited the APS size range ( i . e . , to 0 . 8 µ m to 5 µ m ) . The instrumental limita - tions of the APS have been emphasized in previous stud - ies on expiration aerosols ( e . g . , Johnson and Morawska , 2009 ; Morawska et al . , 2009 ) . For all other instruments and sizing strategies the entire reported size ranges ( see Table IV ) have been used . For OPC instruments , polystyrene latex spheres ( PSLs ) are typically used for particle size calibration . The refractive index of PSLs diﬀers from respiratory par - ticles , however , which will eﬀect calculated sizing . Holm - gren et al . ( 2010 ) provides a size correction of ∼ 1 . 6 based 22 TABLE IV Summary of studies in chronological order reporting aerosol number size distributions ( NSDs ) from human respi - ratory activities .

This correction was adopted to all OPS data , if not already implemented in the original studies . The development of the parameterization followed the workﬂow below : 1 . Respiration PSDs were obtained from tables or dig - itized from ﬁgures of the original publications . 5 The size range of the APS data was limited to 0 . 9 – 5 µ m for aforementioned reasons . For OPC data , the size bins were corrected according to diﬀerence in the refractive index of calibration and respira - tory particles . 2 . The data was normalized by the size bin widths to d C / dlog D and d Q / dlog D , if not already available as such in the original publications . 3 . The PSDs where ﬁtted by a multimodal lognormal function with least square in number and volume ( NSD and VSD ) using Eq . 8 . The ﬁtting was con - ducted with IGOR Pro ( version 8 . 04 , Wavemetrics , Inc . , Portland , OR , USA ) . The ﬁt functions were iteratively optimized to equally describe both , the NSD and VSD of a given data set . A ﬁt for a given PSD was accepted if both NSD and VSD were de - scribed in a physically meaningful way with a max - imal coeﬃcient of determination ( R 2 ) . As a part of the ﬁtting process , some ﬁt parameters were con - strained , described in detail in the corresponding parts of Sect . III . 4 . After ﬁtting , the NSDs and VSDs were normalized to allow a comparison between all PSDs of a cer - tain category . Normalization to a speciﬁc area un - der the curve was conducted : ( a ) for small particles ( D < 5 µ m ) , the overall trimodal PSD were nor - malized to the area under breath - related bimodal distribution ( i . e . , modes B1 and B2 , for details see Sect . III . B . 1 ) , ( b ) for large particles ( D > 5 µ m ) , the overall bimodal PSD was normalized to the area under the second of both modes ( i . e . , mode O2 , for details see Sect . III . B . 2 ) . 5 . Average PSDs were calculated by the arithmetic means of the corresponding ﬁt parameters , based on all PSDs ﬂagged with A in Table IV . 5 For digitization , the web application WebPlotDigitizer avail - able under https : / / automeris . io / WebPlotDigitizer / ( last access 30 Jan 2021 ) has been used . Only those data points were col - lected that could unambiguously be picked . B . parameterizations of particle size distributions for speciﬁc respiratory activities 1 . Breathing Breathing is the most fundamental , frequent , and con - tinuous respiratory activity . Speaking , laughing , singing , coughing , and sneezing involve breathing as an underly - ing mode . Hence , the development of a parameteriza - tion of respiration PSDs should start with a robust rep - resentation of breath - related emissions . Several studies have investigated aerosol formation in relation to diﬀer - ent breathing patterns ( see Fig . 9 ) , and it is widely sup - posed that the BFFB mechanism is primarily – if not exclusively – responsible for the breath - related particle formation ( Sect . II . D ) ( Bake et al . , 2019 , 2017 ; Holm - gren and Ljungstr¨om , 2011 ; Holmgren et al . , 2010 ; John - son and Morawska , 2009 ) . Here , we integrate the pub - lished experimental data to parameterize the shape of the breath PSD . The largely variable particle concentrations ( C N , C V ) and emission rates ( Q N , Q V ) of breath - related emissions , in relation to other respiratory activities , are addressed in Sect . III . C . This analysis shows that – af - ter ﬁtting and normalization – all published breath PSDs agree remarkably well , despite diﬀerences in methodology and variable RH conditions during the measurements . The experimental basis for the parameterization com - prises 34 breath PSDs from 14 studies ( see Table IV ) . Good data coverage exists for the particle size range between 0 . 3 and 5 µ m due to the wide use of the in - struments APS ( Alsved et al . , 2020b ; Gregson et al . , 2021 ; Johnson and Morawska , 2009 ; Johnson et al . , 2011 ; Morawska et al . , 2009 ) ( i . e . , 0 . 9 to 5 µ m , see Sect . III . A ) as well as diﬀerent OPC models ( Almstrand et al . , 2010 , 2009 ; Fabian et al . , 2011 , 2008 ; Hartmann et al . , 2020 ; Haslbeck et al . , 2010 ; Holmgren et al . , 2013 , 2010 ; M¨urbe et al . , 2020 ; Schwarz et al . , 2010 , 2015 ) ( i . e . , 0 . 3 to 3 µ m ) ( see Table IV ) . Studies with data coverage < 0 . 3 µ m are sparse . Holmgren et al . ( 2010 ) published the only study so far with highly size - resolved ( SMPS ) measurements with D < 0 . 3 µ m , which covers the peak and overall shape of the breath PSD . Therefore , we used this data to parameterize the lower end of the breath PSD . Figure 10 shows the PSDs from Holmgren et al . ( 2010 ) and the corresponding bimodal lognormal ﬁts for tidal breath - ing vs breathing with airways closure . The ﬁts represent the PSDs accurately in number and volume representa - tion . Relating to Johnson et al . ( 2011 ) , we refer to both bronchiolar breathing modes as B1 ( peaking D < 0 . 1 µ m in NSD ) and B2 ( peaking D > 0 . 1 µ m in NSD ) . In the ﬁts , the position ( D i ) and the height ( A i ) of both log - normal modes were free parameters , whereas the width ( σ i ) of the modes was ﬁxed to 0 . 9 , This σ i value was iteratively optimized in this work . In fact , an impor - tant result of the ﬁtting approach overall is the observa - tion that σ i = 0 . 9 describes the width of all lognormal 24 FIG . 10 Number and volume particle size distributions ( NSD and VSD ) for tidal breathing ( A and C ) vs breathing with airways closure ( B and D ) adapted from Holmgren et al .

For comparison , the width of the characteristic modes in the ambient aerosol is typically smaller with σ ranging from ∼ 0 . 4 to ∼ 0 . 6 ( P¨ohlker et al . , 2016 ) . The data in the studies by Haslbeck et al . ( 2010 ) and Schwarz et al . ( 2010 ) – both with sizing data down to 0 . 1 µ m , though with much lower size resolution – generally support the bimodal character of the breath PSD . Figure 10 and Table V show that the resulting D i val - ues for both modes are rather consistent for both breath - ing patterns and that the diﬀerence in PSD shape is mainly determined by a variable height of mode B2 . Holmgren et al . ( 2010 ) attributed mode B2 to the BFFB mechanism in the terminal bronchioles as it increased strongly for airway closure relative to tidal breathing ( i . e . , A B2 increased by factor 36 ) . They further speculate 25 FIG . 11 Breath aerosol number and volume size distributions obtained from multiple studies ( A , C ) and bimodal ﬁt functions with underlying lognormal modes ( B , D ) for parameterization of NSDs and VSDs . Tidal breathing ( black line ) vs airway closure breathing ( orange line ) maneuvers were discriminated according to Holmgren et al . ( 2010 ) . In the legend , T speciﬁes tidal - like breathing patterns and C speciﬁes breathing patterns with airway closure . After ﬁtting , all NSDs and VSDs were normalized to the area under the curve to account for the widely variable breathe aerosol concentrations . The underlying lognormal modes B1 and B2 are shown as dashed lines .

For further details , refer to the original articles directly . that mode B1 may originate from a similar ﬁlm burst - ing e . g . , at the alveoli openings in the course of alveolar dynamics during respiration , which ( to the best of our knowledge ) so far has remained an unveriﬁed hypothe - sis ( Namati et al . , 2008 ; Scarpelli , 1998 ; Scarpelli and Hills , 2000 ) . The diﬀerence in breath PSD shape can be well described by the ratio of both mode heights in NSD representation with A B1 / A B2 = 7 . 0 for tidal breathing vs A B1 / A B2 = 0 . 3 for breathing with airway closure . These ﬁxed mode height ratios have been used in the course of our further analyses to constrain multimodal ﬁts for PSD data that cover ( part of ) the size range of mode B2 but not of mode B1 . Figure 11 summarizes all breath PSDs found in the literature after ﬁtting and normalization . It shows a consistent picture with essentially all data points falling within a relatively narrow ’corridor’ . Only the VSDs from Morawska et al . ( 2009 ) deviate , for unknown rea - sons . At ﬁrst glance , the good agreement of all breath PSDs is remarkable given that multiple studies with dif - ferent instruments and data from a large number of vol - unteers in the experiments are combined here . In fact , Fig . 11 suggests that breath aerosols are associated with a characteristic bimodal shape of the PSD without a clear inter - or intra - subject variability . This is in stark contrast to the breath - related C N and Q N , which are widely vari - able across individuals ( Sect . III . C ) ( M¨urbe et al . , 2020 ; Schwarz et al . , 2010 ) . At second glance though , the con - sistent PSD shape appears less surprising as the size dis - tribution – after BFFB emission deep in the lung – is ’shaped’ by the transmissibility of the respiratory tract upon exhalation ( Schwarz et al . , 2010 ) . This means that on their way to the mouth or nose certain small par - ticle fractions are removed by diﬀusional losses and cer - tain large particle fractions are removed by sedimentation ( von der Weiden et al . , 2009 ) . In fact , established lung deposition models , such as the International Commission on Radiological Protection ( ICPR ) model ( Hinds , 1999 ) , 26 FIG . 12 Number and volume particle size distributions ( NSD and VSD ) for laboratory generated sea spray aerosols ( SSA ) based on study by Prather et al . ( 2013 ) with lognormal ﬁt functions ( solid lines ) . The size distributions were not nor - malized . Sea spray aerosols in Prather et al . ( 2013 ) were generated with three diﬀerent methods : ( i ) sintered glass , ( ii ) plunging waterfall , and ( iii ) breaking waves ( see diﬀer - ently colored markers ) . Note that the PSDs of SSA react sensitively to the bubble size distributions . Data from plung - ing waterfall and breaking wave were combined and ﬁtted jointly with monomodal lognormal functions as size distribu - tions were similar . Sintered glass data was ﬁtted with sep - arate bimodal lognormal ﬁt and shows remarkable similarity to breath aerosol ( Fig . 11 . The corresponding ﬁt parameters are summarized in Table V . show a penetration maximum of the respiratory tract be - tween 0 . 3 and 0 . 4 µ m , which corresponds with the size distribution maximum in Fig . 11 . Accordingly , the char - acteristic shape of the breath PSD is presumably deter - mined by both , the BFFB emission mechanism as well as particle losses upon exhalation . The ﬁt functions in Fig . 11 were calculated as the av - erages of all ﬁt parameters from the individually ﬁt - ted NSDs and represent a robust parameterization of breath PSDs . The average ﬁt parameters are summa - rized in Table VI . Across all individual NSDs , mode B2 ranges between D B2 = 0 . 15 µ m and 0 . 53 µ m ( aver - age D B2 = 0 . 31 µ m ) . The variability in D B2 can presum - ably be explained by two eﬀects : First , the measured droplet diameters equilibrate quickly as a function of RH ( Sect . II . C ) . Therefore , the diﬀerence in D B2 of the in - dividual NSDs reﬂect to some extent the ( large ) diﬀer - ences in RH under the corresponding measurement con - ditions ( see Table IV ) . Note that temperature and RH are poorly deﬁned or undeﬁned in some studies , which complicates the comparison of diﬀerent NSDs . For many studies in Table IV , RH levels ranged between 80 % and water saturation – a humidity regime , in which a small ∆RH causes a large ∆ D ( Fig . 4 and Fig . 5 ) . A refer - ence point in this context has been provided by Holm - gren et al . ( 2011 ) , who characterized the RH - related ∆ D by measuring comparable breath NSDs ( involving airway closure ) at 75 % vs 99 . 5 % RH . Here , the NSD at 75 % cor - responds to D B2 = 0 . 18 µ m and the NSD at 99 . 5 % cor - responds to D B2 = 0 . 45 µ m , yielding an increase in D by a factor of 2 . 5 in good agreement with Fig . 5 . The RH - related diﬀerence in mode B2 for both PSDs is shown in Fig . 11A and C as background shading . It shows that the RH - related variability in D corresponds well with the overall scattering of the data points . Second , the dif - ferent breathing pattern summarized in Fig . 11 and the associated diﬀerences in air residence time in the respi - ratory tract might also cause certain modulations in the overall PSD shape ( e . g . , Holmgren et al . , 2013 ; Johnson and Morawska , 2009 ; Schwarz et al . , 2010 ) . This eﬀect seems to be smaller than the RH inﬂuence , though fur - ther studies are needed . In Sect . II . D , the mechanistic analogy between respi - ratory aerosol formation through the BFFB process and other natural bubble bursting processes , such as sea spray aerosol ( SSA ) formation through bubble bursting at the air - ocean interface , has been pointed out Holmgren et al . ( 2010 ) . For further illustration , Fig . 12 shows SSA size distributions from Prather et al . ( 2013 ) , generated in the laboratory with natural sea water through three diﬀerent processes . Worth noting here is that the breath aerosol vs SSA PSDs span across a similar size range and fur - ther show some analogies in terms of mode position and shape ( i . e . , similar bimodal shape of sintered glass PSD vs tidal breath PSD ) . This might reﬂect the mechanistic relationship of both aerosol formation processes , how - ever , should probably not be over - interpreted . In this context , the similarity underlines the general plausibil - ity of the breath PSD parameterizations in Fig . 11 in the relation to the relatively well characterized SSA size dis - tributions ( e . g . , Gong et al . , 2020 ; Quinn et al . , 2015 ; Wex et al . , 2016 ) . 2 . Speaking and singing Speaking and singing involve opening or closing of the glottis as well as tensing and vibrating of the vocal folds in the larynx , producing – together with 27 FIG . 13 Combined literature data on speaking - and singing - related particle NSDs ( A , B ) and VSDs ( C , D ) with parameteri - zation based on ﬁve lognormal modes . The modes B1 , B2 , and LT , centered < 5 µ m , are described by a trimodal lognormal ﬁt ( A , C ) . The trimodal distributions in ( A ) and ( C ) were normalized to the area under the breath - related bimodal curve ( combined area of modes B1 and B2 ) to emphasize the relative contribution of mode LT . Grey shading shows variability of mode LT . The inﬂuence of varying RH ( i . e . , 71 . 8 % vs 96 . 7 % ) based on experimental data from Morawska et al . ( 2009 ) is illustrated as light blue shading in ( A ) and ( C ) . Note that this study is an outlier in terms of LT mode position ( i . e . , D LT = 0 . 45 lowest value observed , which , however , does not diminish its value in specifying the RH - related variability . The modes O1 and O2 , centered > 5 µ m , are described by mono - or bimodal lognormal ﬁts ( B , D ) . All NSDs and VSDs in ( B ) and ( D ) were normalized to the area under mode O2 to emphasize the relative variability of mode O1 . Legend summarizes information on speciﬁc speak and sing activities conducted in the individual studies . For further details , refer to the original articles directly . mouth , lips , and tongue movements – a wide spectrum of sounds ( e . g . , Abkarian et al . , 2020 ) . Both , speak - ing and singing , are widely variable with , e . g . , speak - ing spanning from whispering to shouting . Speaking is a relatively frequent and semi - continuous respiratory ac - tivity . In relation to speaking , singing is typically char - acterized by continuous vocalization , higher sound pres - sure , higher frequencies , deeper breaths , higher peak air ﬂows and more articulated consonants ( Alsved et al . , 2020b ) . In airborne pathogen transmission , both speak - ing and singing have been considered as signiﬁcant driv - ing forces as they are major sources of respiratory parti - cles ( e . g . , Asadi et al . , 2019 ; Gregson et al . , 2021 ; M¨urbe et al . , 2020 ) . Mechanistically , particle formation through speaking and singing is still somewhat uncertain ( John - son and Morawska , 2009 ; Johnson et al . , 2011 ) . Each likely involves two or even three formation mechanisms and sites : ( i ) laryngeal particle generation , ( ii ) particle formation through mouth , lips , and tongue movements , and ( iii ) under vigorous conditions probably also high - speed shear forces at the ELF - air interface in the trachea ( e . g . , Johnson and Morawska , 2009 ; Johnson et al . , 2011 ) . The breath - related bronchiolar particle formation is in - volved as an underlying process . Figure 13 summarizes the existing experimental data on speaking - and singing - related particle emissions , span - ning across a wide size range from > 10 nm to ∼ 1000 µ m . We found that a parameterization based on ﬁve lognor - mal modes represents the experimental data well . Two of these modes are the bronchiolar modes B1 and B2 since breathing is inherently involved in speaking and singing . Beyond the modes B1 and B2 ( located at D B1 = 0 . 07 µ m and D B2 = 0 . 3 µ m ) , a third mode emerges , which presumably originates from particle formation in 28 TABLE VI Average ﬁt parameters for breathing ( see Fig . 11 ) , speaking and singing ( see Fig . 13 ) as well as coughing ( see Fig . 15 ) size distributions in d N / dlog D representation .

( 2011 ) . We termed the third mode LT ( L and T for larynx and trachea ) , accordingly . Based on the individual NSDs in Fig . 13 , mode LT ranges between D LT = 0 . 7 µ m and 1 . 5 µ m ( average D LT = 1 . 0 µ m ) . Note that we omitted one outlier at D LT = 0 . 45 based on the study by Morawska et al . ( 2009 ) in this general state - ment . In the size range of large particles , the individual PSDs can be described well by either one or two lognor - mal modes ( Fig . 13B , D ) . As these large droplets presum - ably originate from mouth , lips , and tongue movements , we refer to them as oral modes O1 and O2 ( Johnson et al . , 2011 ) . Mode O1 ranges between D O1 = 8 µ m and 13 µ m ( average D O1 = 10 µ m ) and mode O2 is located be - tween D O2 = 60 µ m and 130 µ m ( average D O2 = 96 µ m ) . A summary of all average ﬁt parameters can be found in Table VI . Overall , the ﬁve modes have signiﬁcant overlap and constitute a rather continuous PSD across more than ﬁve orders of magnitude in D . The parameterization of speaking - and singing - related PSDs has been developed separately for two size regimes : a small particle range < 5 µ m with modes B1 , B2 and LT ( Fig . 13A , C ) vs a large particle range > 5 µ m with modes O1 and O2 ( Fig . 13B , D ) . This two - step approach was chosen because the existing experimental data originates from two ’groups’ of instruments that focus primarily ei - ther on the small or the large particle regime . For the small particle range , the data coverage is comparatively good between 0 . 9 and 5 µ m , due to predominant use of the APS ( Alsved et al . , 2020b ; Asadi et al . , 2019 ; Gregson et al . , 2021 ; Johnson et al . , 2011 ; Morawska et al . , 2009 ) . Data < 0 . 9 µ m is relatively sparse and so far based on three studies with OPC measurements only ( Hartmann et al . , 2020 ; Lai et al . , 2011 ; M¨urbe et al . , 2020 ) . Over - all , we collected 17 speaking - related PSDs from 7 studies and 4 singing - related PSDs from 2 study for the range < 5 µ m ( see Table VI ) . For the analysis of the large parti - cle range between ∼ 5 to > 1000 µ m , instruments such as an open - path laser diﬀraction droplet sizer ( Han et al . , 2013 ; Smith et al . , 2020 ) , sedimentation sampling in com - bination with microscopy ( Duguid , 1946 ; Johnson et al . , 2011 ; Loudon and Roberts , 1967a , b ; Xie et al . , 2009 ) , and interferometric Mie imaging ( Chao et al . , 2009 ) have been used . We found 7 speaking - related PSDs from 5 studies and no singing - related PSD for the size range > 5 µ m ( see Table VI ) . In the trimodal lognormal ﬁts of the modes B1 , B2 , and LT , some of the 9 ﬁt parameters had to be ﬁxed because ( i ) the available experimental data cover only a comparatively narrow band of the relevant size range and ( ii ) the modes are not separately resolved due to signiﬁ - cant overlap . Speciﬁcally , the parameters D B1 , D B2 , σ B1 , and σ B2 were ﬁxed as they were adapted from the average breath PSD in Fig . 11 . The only exception are two stud - ies ( Alsved et al . , 2020b ; Morawska et al . , 2009 ) , in which the data points resolved part of the mode B2 suﬃciently well so that D B2 could also be implemented as a free ﬁt - ting parameter . Moreover the ratio A B1 / A B2 = 7 . 0 for tidal breathing was ﬁxed , whereas the overall height of this bimodal ﬁt for B1 and B2 was a free parameter . For the mode LT , the parameters D LT and A LT were free , whereas σ LT was ﬁxed to 0 . 9 for reasons outlined in Sect . III . B . 1 . In the bimodal lognormal ﬁts of the modes O1 and O2 , all ﬁt parameters ( i . e . , D O1 , D O2 , A O1 , A O2 , 29 FIG . 14 Number aerosol size distributions ( NSD ) for diﬀerent speaking and singing maneuvers from multiple studies with trimodal lognormal ﬁt functions ( solid black line ) . Panel ( A ) shows tidal breathing with underlying modes B1 and B2 in relation to Fig . 10A to emphasize the emerging third speaking - and singing - related mode LT . Strength of mode LT appears to increase with increasingly ’vigorous’ speaking and / or singing . As tidal breathe underlies all speaking and singing maneuvers , tidal breath - related bimodal ﬁt from Fig . 10A ( with ﬁxed ratio A B1 / A B2 = 7 . 0 ) has been used in all trimodal ﬁts here . Underlying modes B1 and B2 are marked by grey shading in all panels . The individual size distributions here were not normalized . All three modes B1 , B2 , and LT are shown as black dashed lines . σ O1 , and σ O2 ) were free because the experimental data cover the relevant size range well and the modes O1 and O2 were suﬃciently separated . Note that also in these ﬁts , where σ i was implemented as a free parameters , σ O1 and σ O2 values close to 0 . 9 were obtained , which under - lines that this lognormal peak width is a good represen - tation for respiration PSD modes overall . Figure 13 shows the variability of mode LT on top of the modes B1 and B2 . We found no systematic changes in D LT as a function of speak or sing activities as illus - trated in Fig . 14 . This suggests that the shape of the trimodal distribution is generally consistent for diﬀerent speak and sing activities , which is in line with previ - ous studies reporting no major changes in PSD shape in relation to vocalization , loudness , and language spo - ken ( Asadi et al . , 2019 ; Gregson et al . , 2021 ; M¨urbe et al . , 2020 ) . In contrast , the ratio of the modes B2 and LT varies widely from A B2 / A LT = 180 ( dominated by the breath - related mode B2 ) to 0 . 06 ( dominated by the speaking - or singing - related mode LT ) . Here , the cal - culation of A B2 / A LT is associated with some uncertainty since most available speaking - and singing - related PSDs do not reach below 0 . 9 µ m and , therefore , cover mode B2 only partly . Figure 14 suggests that the ratio A B2 / A LT depends on the intensity of the speaking or singing activ - ities , which is also in line with previous evidence ( Asadi et al . , 2019 ; Gregson et al . , 2021 ) . Here , the tidal breathe example in Fig . 14A serve as a reference case for the range of speak and sing activities from whispering in Fig . 14B to load singing in Fig . 14I . In relation to the general vari - ability of the mode LT , Fig . 13A and C emphasize that the RH inﬂuence on mode position and shape is compar - atively small . 30 Mode O2 was found for all individual PSDs in Fig . 13B and D . The presence of mode O1 is less conclusive though . It is clearly resolved in three studies ( Chao et al . , 2009 ; Duguid , 1946 ; Loudon and Roberts , 1967a ) and ap - pears to be absent in one study ( Johnson et al . , 2011 ) . Speciﬁcally , in the three PSDs in Xie et al . ( 2009 ) , mode O1 was clearly resolved in one of them and absent in the other two . The ratio of the mode heights A O1 / A O2 varies largely from ∼ 10 in Duguid ( 1946 ) to ∼ 0 . 14 in Xie et al . ( 2009 ) . The ambiguous ﬁnding on mode O1 can potentially be explained by either experimental is - sues such as particle drying dynamics and , therefore , ob - servations in diﬀerent non - equilibrium states or diﬀerent sensitivities of the instruments used in this particular size range . Further , the rather variable appearance of mode O1 could potentially also be caused by mechanistic dif - ference in the course of droplet formation in the mouth . The remarkable diﬀerences among the PSDs in Xie et al . ( 2009 ) ( which were taken under comparable conditions and with the same technique ) suggest that the presence of mode O1 indeed depends on diﬀerences in e . g . , saliva composition . This particular study focused on the PSDs in relation to the use of food dye in the mouth for better microscopic detection of settled particles . Here , mode O1 was present when sugar and dye were used , whereas mode O1 was absent when no dye was used . Clearly , further studies are needed to extent our knowledge on speaking - and singing - related emission in this large par - ticle range . Regarding the drying dynamics and measurements un - der non - equilibrium states , Fig . 4B shows that the evap - oration times of particles in the smaller modes B1 , B2 , and LT is comparatively short , which implies that these particle were likely dried to a signiﬁcant extent under the experimental conditions of most studies in Table IV . For the particles in the larger modes O1 and O2 , how - ever , Fig . 4B shows comparatively long evaporation times – especially if evaporation delays as shown in Chong et al . ( 2021 ) are taken into account – which implies that these particles were likely measured under non - equilibrium conditions . Accordingly , these kinetic eﬀects probably entail that the extent of drying decreases from mode B1 towards O2 . For Fig . 13 , this presumably en - tails that the modes O1 and O2 are shifted to larger diameters and would move closer towards the mode LT , if they were dried to the equilibrium state under the given RH conditions . 3 . Coughing and sneezing Coughing is caused by an abrupt parting of the vocal folds and an associated sudden expulsion of air ( Grot - berg , 2001 ; Morawska et al . , 2009 ) . Sneezing is a sud - den violent spasmodic expiration with a blast of air being driven through the nasal and mouth chambers ( Brubaker , 1919 ; Fontes et al . , 2020 ; Han et al . , 2013 ) . Both are short , non - continuous , and vigorous respiratory activities associated with an ejection of ELF and saliva . Traditionally , they have been regarded as main drivers for pathogen transmission ( e . g . , Bourouiba et al . , 2014 ; Dhand and Li , 2020 ) . Similar to speaking and singing , ( i ) laryngeal aerosol generation , ( ii ) droplet formation through mouth , lips , and tongue movements , and ( iii ) high - speed shear forces at the ELF - air interface in the trachea and ( main ) bronchi are probably the relevant for - mation mechanisms and sites ( Johnson and Morawska , 2009 ; Johnson et al . , 2011 ; Patterson and Wood , 2019 ) . The breath - related bronchiolar particle formation is in - volved as an underlying process . Compared to breathing and speaking , the available data on cough - and sneezing - related particle formation is relatively sparse : for the size range < 5 µ m , we found 5 PSDs from 5 studies for cough - ing and no PSD for sneezing . For the size range > 5 µ m , we found 5 PSDs from 5 studies for coughing and 1 PSD for sneezing . Figure 15 summarizes the experimental data on cough - related particle emissions in the size range from > 10 nm to ∼ 1000 µ m . The PSD shape is similar to the speaking - and singing - related PSDs and can also be described by ﬁve lognormal modes ( Fig . 13 ) . In addition to the bronchiolar modes B1 and B2 , the LT mode emerges , similar to speaking and singing . The mode LT is lo - cated between D LT = 0 . 8 µ m and 1 . 2 µ m ( on average D LT = 1 . 0 µ m ) . The mode height ratio A B 2 / A LT ranges from 20 to 7 . 5 and is therefore higher than the ratio A B 2 / A LT for speaking - and singing - related PSDs , which means that the cough - related mode LT is weaker than the speaking - and singing - related mode LT , relative to mode B2 ( at least within the scope of the data reviewed here ) . The large particle size range can be represented by two oral modes O1 and O2 as for speaking and singing ( Johnson et al . , 2011 ) . Mode O1 is located between D O1 = 8 µ m and 13 µ m ( on average D O1 = 11 µ m ) . Mode O2 is located between D O2 = 90 µ m and 200 µ m ( on av - erage D O2 = 128 µ m ) . The mode height ratio A O1 / A O2 is rather variable , ranging from 0 in Duguid ( 1946 ) to ∼ 16 in Loudon and Roberts ( 1967a , b ) . Similar to speak - ing and singing , mode O2 is present in all ﬁve studies , whereas mode O1 is present in three studies ( Chao et al . , 2009 ; Duguid , 1946 ; Loudon and Roberts , 1967a ) and absent in two studies ( Johnson et al . , 2011 ; Xie et al . , 2009 ) . The PSD for sneezing for the large particle size range based on Duguid ( 1946 ) shows mode positions D O1 = 8 and D O2 = 130 as well as a mode height ratio A O1 / A O2 = 48 . A summary of all average ﬁt parame - ters can be found in Table VI . A remarkable observation is the similarity between speaking - / singing - related vs coughing - related PSDs in terms of properties of all ﬁve modes ( compare Figs . 13 and 15 ) . This suggests that for both respiratory activi - 31 FIG . 15 Combined literature data on cough - related particle number size distributions , NSDs , ( A , B ) with calculated volume size distributions , VSDs , ( C , D ) and parameterization based on ﬁve lognormal modes . Figure is closely related to Fig . 13 . The modes B1 , B2 , and LT , centered < 5 µ m , are described by a trimodal lognormal ﬁt ( A , C ) . The trimodal distributions in ( A ) and ( C ) were normalized to the area under the breath - related bimodal curve ( combined area of modes B1 and B2 ) to emphasize the relative contribution of mode LT . The modes O1 and O2 , centered > 5 µ m , are described by mono - or bimodal lognormal ﬁts ( B , D ) . All NSDs and VSDs in ( B ) and ( D ) were normalized to the area under mode O2 to emphasize the relative variability of mode O1 . ties the modes LT , O1 , and O2 are formed by the same or at least similar mechanisms in the respiratory tract . Another remarkable observation is that the sneezing - related PSD in Fig . 15B and D resembles the correspond - ing coughing - related PSDs . At least in the range of modes O1 and O2 ) , both respiratory activities can be described by a similar PSD , at least within the scope of data in Fig . 15 . Note that PSD data on sneezing is generally sparse . Besides Duguid ( 1946 ) , also Han et al . ( 2013 ) reported sneeze PSDs , which , however , could not be implemented in Fig . 15 due to diﬃculties with normal - ization . 6 Nevertheless , qualitatively the data from Han 6 Since the area under mode O2 was used for normalization in Fig . 15B and D and not all PSDs in Han et al . ( 2013 ) showed mode O2 , the data could not consistently be normalized . Fur - thermore , the PSDs were only provided in relative and not in absolute terms so that no mode - speciﬁc particle number and vol - ume concentrations could be retrieved for the further steps of our analysis . et al . ( 2013 ) are mostly consistent with Fig . 15 as about half of the their PSDs show a bimodal PSDs with one mode at ∼ 70 µ m , corresponding to mode O2 . In their data , another mode is reported at ∼ 400 µ m , indicating the presence of an additional mode O3 , although com - prising very low particle concentrations . The other half of PSDs in Han et al . ( 2013 ) is monomodal showing mode O3 only . C . Number concentrations and emission rates The previous sections focused on the shape of the PSDs and developed a consistent parameterization of their multimodal character . Here , we used the multi - modal parameterization to calculate and summarize the statistics of mode - speciﬁc properties in Fig . 16 , such as number and volume concentrations ( C N , C V ) as well as number and volume emission rates ( Q N , Q V ) based on the available studies with quantitative PSDs ( ﬂag A in 32 FIG . 16 Statistical summary of mode - speciﬁc particle concentrations ( C ) , emission rates ( Q ) , and peak diameters ( D ) for individual modes B1 , B2 , LT , O1 , and O2 . Figure illustrates the wide variability of C and Q across several orders of magnitude . Particle concentrations and emission rates are provided for number and volume ( C N vs C V and Q N vs Q V ) . Further , the ratios of C N of adjacent modes ( C N ( i ) / C N ( i + 1 ) ) , derived from individual studies with PSD data covering two or more modes ( i . e . , C N ( B1 ) / C N ( B2 ) , C N ( B2 ) / C N ( LT ) , C N ( LT ) / C N ( O1 ) , and C N ( O1 ) / C N ( O2 ) ) are shown . Colored markers ( short vertical lines ) distinguish between respiratory activities ( see legend ) . In the box - whisker plots , the boxes represent the 25 and 75 percentiles , the grey lines the medians , the blue diamond markers the means and the whiskers the 9 and 91 percentiles . Table IV ) . Consistent with previous studies ( e . g . , Asadi et al . , 2019 ; Bake et al . , 2017 ; Gregson et al . , 2021 ; Holm - gren et al . , 2010 ; M¨urbe et al . , 2020 ; Schwarz et al . , 2015 ; Xie et al . , 2009 ) , the obtained C and Q levels are highly variable and span across several orders of magnitude . The large variability in Q among infected individuals has been considered as a potential explanation for the exis - tence of superspreaders in infectious disease transmission as they emit much more potentially pathogen - laden par - ticles than others ( e . g . , Asadi et al . , 2019 ; Bischoﬀ et al . , 2013 ; Edwards et al . , 2021 ) . On average , the highest C N and Q N levels were found for the modes B1 and B2 , which then decrease via mode LT to modes O1 and O2 . The opposite trend – a strong increase from mode B1 to O2 – was found for C V and Q V since the volume scales with D 3 and , therefore overcom - pensates the decreasing trend in number representation . Figure 16F shows the comparatively low variability of the peak position of individual modes and further emphasizes that some modes ( i . e . , B2 and LT ) overlap signiﬁcantly , whereas others ( i . e . , O1 and O2 ) appear rather well sep - arated . The ratios C N ( i ) / C N ( i + 1 ) in Fig . 16C shows that the variability of the relative strength of individ - ual modes is rather high ( compare with Sect . III . B . 2 and Sect . III . B . 3 ) . Both the particle concentration and emission ﬂux for a given respiratory activity are relevant quantities for a better understanding of airborne disease transmission , which can in principle occur in the near - ﬁeld or far - ﬁeld ( Fig . 1 ) . Figure 17 provides total C and Q levels for se - lected particle size ranges to emphasize the relative im - portance of breathing , speaking , and coughing in near - and far - ﬁeld scenarios of disease transmission . In a potential near - ﬁeld aerosol transmission scenario , the recipient is located closely ( few meters ) to the emit - ter and inhales her / his concentrated particle puﬀ ( s ) rel - atively soon after release ( Fig . 17A ) . Thus , the time span between emission and inhalation is presumably too short for particle cloud dilution as well as large particle sedi - mentation to occur to a signiﬁcant degree . Thus , Fig . 17B and C compare the total C N and C V levels for the size range from 0 . 1 to 100 µ m . Here , 0 . 1 µ m was chosen as a lower limit as it is the physical size of , e . g . , SARS - CoV - 2 and infuenza virions ( see Sect . III . D ) . Coughing as well as presumably also sneezing ( not shown here due to sparse data availability ) causes the highest concentrations in the near - ﬁeld aerosol cloud . For C N in the range from 0 . 1 to 100 µ m , coughing clearly exceeds speaking , which is closely followed by breathing . For C V in the range from 0 . 1 to 100 µ m , coughing is highest , comparatively closely 33 FIG . 17 Total number and volume concentrations ( C N , C V ) as well as emission rates ( Q N , Q V ) of exhaled particles for diﬀerent respiratory activities . Two diﬀerent particle size ranges were chosen to compare conditions under near - vs far - ﬁeld disease transmission scenarios : ( i ) In the near - ﬁeld ( A – C ) , C N and C V in the exhaled puﬀ ( s ) prior to dilution and dissipation are primarily relevant . Here , a lower threshold of 0 . 1 µ m ( typical size of virus pathogens , Fig . 19 ) and an upper threshold of 100 µ m ( upper limit of common aerosol deﬁnitions , see Sect . II . A ) were chosen . ( ii ) In the far - ﬁeld ( D – F ) , Q N and Q V are primarily relevant , especially if emission extends over longer periods . Here , a lower threshold of 0 . 1 µ m and an upper threshold of 5 µ m ( particles below this threshold have particularly long residence time in air , Fig . 2 ) were chosen . In addition , C and Q across the entire size range of the parameterization ( i . e . , 0 . 002 to 4000 µ m ) are shown in all cases for reference . The total C N and C V as well as Q N and Q V values were derived as the integral under the average multimodal PSDs ( e . g . , Fig . 19B and C ) . followed by speaking , and breathing being signiﬁcantly smaller . These trends in number and volume representa - tion result from the diﬀerences in the multimodal shape of the corresponding PSDs and have to be considered in the choice of either C N or C V for risk assessments . In a potential far - ﬁeld aerosol transmission scenario , an infected individual emits pathogen - laden particles and those can accumulate over time in conﬁned spaces , such as a restaurant room or public transport ( Fig . 17D ) ( e . g . , Azimi et al . , 2021 ; Birnir and Angheluta , 2020 ; Hwang et al . , 2021 ; Kohanski et al . , 2020 ; Lelieveld et al . , 2020 ) . If critical pathogen concentrations can build up in room air , depends on multiple factors , such as particle size , room size , ventilation rates etc ( e . g . , Helleis et al . , 2021 ; Lai , 2002 ; Nazaroﬀ , 2016 ; Riley et al . , 2002 , and refer - ences therein ) . Infection risks depend on the airborne pathogen concentrations , exposure times , and the recip - ient’s susceptibility . Here , the source strength , which is represented by the particle emission rate as a function of respiratory activities , is of primary relevance . To empha - size the diﬀerent source strengths of breathing , speaking , and coughing , we focus on the particle size range from 0 . 1 to 5 µ m , comprising those particles with particularly long airborne residence times . Figure 17E and F shows that in a far - ﬁeld scenario speaking clearly dominates in Q N and Q V in the range from 0 . 1 to 5 µ m , followed by coughing and then breathing . This suggests that speaking might be a particularly important driver for airborne trans - mission as it represents a comparatively strong particle source and further occurs more frequent / continuous that , e . g . , coughing . Note further that the transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 occurs mostly pre - symptomatically , which further diminishes the supposed relevance of coughing and emphasizes the supposed importance of speaking . D . Multi - modality of size distributions in airborne disease transmission Figure 18 combines main ﬁndings of this review and data synthesis and emphasizes that a detailed under - standing of the multimodal shape of the respiration PSDs provides novel mechanistic insight into airborne disease transmission and the eﬀectiveness of preventative mea - sures ( Johnson et al . , 2011 ) . An important parameter for the transport of viruses , bacteria , as well as bacterial or fungal spores by respiratory particles is the pathogen’s size . Figure 18A , summarizes the size of selected aerosol 34 transmissible pathogens , such as rhinoviruses ( one of the agent groups causing the ’common cold’ ) ( e . g . , Fabian et al . , 2011 ; Pitkaranta and Hayden , 1998 ) , measles mor - billiviruses ( e . g . , Liljeroos et al . , 2011 ) , SARS - CoV - 2 ( e . g . , Ke et al . , 2020 ; Yao et al . , 2020 ; Zhu et al . , 2020 ) , inﬂuenza viruses ( e . g . , Enoki et al . , 2012 ; Mosley and Wyckoﬀ , 1946 ; Rossman and Lamb , 2011 ) and M . tu - berculosis ( e . g . , Schafer , 1999 ) . The pathogen size de - ﬁnes the lower limit for the respiratory particle size range that is relevant for pathogen transport . Figure 18B and C combine the parameterizations for diﬀerent respira - tory activities , in relation to the average mode - speciﬁc emission rates from Fig . 16 and Fig . 17 . The breath - related bimodal PSD is shown in relation to the speaking - and singing - related as well as cough - related pentamodal PSDs , yielding a coherent overall picture . The compar - ison shows that all viruses in Fig . 18A are in principle small enough to be transmitted with all ﬁve modes . For the larger M . tuberculosis , the modes B1 and B2 can pre - sumably be excluded as potential carriers , which leaves the modes LT , O1 , and O2 for transmission . Particularly valuable – but also sparse since diﬃcult to obtain – is experimental data on the actual pathogen size distributions in the carrier aerosol as introduced in Sect . II . B . 3 . It provides evidence on the modes , in which the pathogens are actually being transmitted . The avail - able data from size - resolved sampling of airborne M . tu - berculosis , inﬂuenza virions , and SARS - CoV - 2 virions are shown in Fig . 18D , E and F . Generally , the available data suggest that these pathogens are enriched in a certain size range of the overall PSD , which presumably reﬂects the sites of infection and particle formation in the respiratory tract . Note however , that the number of existing studies is small and certain parts of the overall size range ( i . e . , > 10 µ m ) have not been investigated with size - resolved sampling approaches , yet . 7 Under the assumption that airborne pathogen trans - mission is driven by speciﬁc respiratory activities and their associated PSD modes , we applied the previously deﬁned parameterization to the pathogen size distribu - 7 Diﬀerent aerosol samplers were used in the studies summarized in Fig . 18D , E and F : ( i ) the Sioutas ﬁve - stage personal cascade impactor ( SKC , Inc . ) ( described in Misra et al . , 2002 ; Singh et al . , 2003 ) and ( used in Lednicky et al . , 2021 ; Lednicky and Loeb , 2013 ; Liu et al . , 2020 ) ; ( ii ) the cascade cyclone of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH ) sampler ( described in Cao et al . , 2011 ) and ( used in Chia et al . , 2020 ; Lindsley et al . , 2010 ; Santarpia et al . , 2020a ) ; ( iii ) the An - dersen six - stage cascade impactor ( described in Fennelly et al . , 2015 ) and ( used in Fennelly et al . , 2012 , 2004b ; Patterson et al . , 2018 ) , and ( iv ) a two - stage slit impactor with an intermediate condensational growth step as part of the G - II sampling setup ( described in McDevitt et al . , 2013 ) and ( used in Milton et al . , 2013 ) . Strengths and limitations of the individual sampling ap - proaches have to be kept in mind when results are compared ( further information can be found in Mainelis , 2020 ) . tions . Speciﬁcally , we described the size - resolved concen - trations of the pathogens – i . e . , ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) copies for virions and culture forming unit ( CFU ) for M . tuberculosis – by the previously deﬁned mode prop - erties ( see Table VI ) . Here , the position ( D i ) and width ( σ i ) of the mode ( s ) were mostly constrained and only slightly adjusted , whereas the number of modes ( one or two ) as well as their heights ( A i ) were scaled to repre - sent the pathogen size distributions best . In all cases , the pathogen size distributions could be described con - sistently with one to three of the modes B2 , LT , and O1 . This approach holds uncertainties , especially due to the small number of data sets as well as the comparatively coarse size resolution ( e . g . , three to six size bins only ) . Nevertheless , Fig . 18D , E and F show conceptually that the pathogen size distributions can be described consis - tently with an underlying modal structure in agreement with the overall PSD parameterization . M . tuberculosis in Fig . 18D was sampled by Fen - nelly et al . ( 2012 , 2004b ) and Patterson et al . ( 2018 ) from infected and coughing individuals and the result - ing pathogen size distributions can be ﬁtted well by the cough - related mode LT . The agreement between the M . tuberculosis size distributions and mode LT is remark - ably consistent . The M . tuberculosis size distribution decreases towards the modes B1 and B2 , which is con - sistent with the fact that those exhaled particles are too small for pathogen transport . Moreover , the M . tubercu - losis size distribution decreases ( rather steeply ) towards the modes O1 and O2 , which suggests that also these modes may not play a primary role in TB transmission . It has to be kept in mind , however , that large particles are particular prone to impaction and sedimentation losses in the sampling setup and that the potential inﬂuence of such sampling artifacts on the shape of the pathogen size distribution has to be critically evaluated ( Mainelis , 2020 ; Niazi et al . , 2020 ; von der Weiden et al . , 2009 ) . The size distributions of airborne inﬂuenza virions , obtained from breathing ( Fabian et al . , 2008 ; Fennelly , 2020 ; Milton et al . , 2013 ) and coughing ( Lindsley et al . , 2010 ) individuals as well as from mixed respiratory activ - ities ( Lednicky and Loeb , 2013 ) are shown in Fig . 18E . 8 The breath - related inﬂuenza size distributions suggest a 8 The upper limit of the largest size bin is not speciﬁed on all stud - ies or pre - deﬁned by the design of the samplers . It is needed , how - ever , for the normalization of concentrations to the bin widths . Lednicky et al . ( 2021 ) and Liu et al . ( 2020 ) deﬁne 10 µ m as up - per limit of the largest size bin . For all other inﬂuenza - and SARS - CoV - 2 - related studies ( Chia et al . , 2020 ; Lednicky and Loeb , 2013 ; Milton et al . , 2013 ; Santarpia et al . , 2020a ) 10 µ m were chosen here as well for consistency . Note also that 20 µ m was tested instead of 10 µ m as an upper size limit and did not aﬀect the bin width - normalized concentration of the correspond - ing size bin signiﬁcantly . The lower size threshold of the smallest size bin was set to 0 . 1 µ m , which is given by the average size of the SARS - CoV - 2 virions . 35 FIG . 18 Synthesis ﬁgure emphasizing the relevance of the multimodal character of the exhaled particle size distribution ( PSD ) in airborne disease transmission . Figure combines the PSD parameterization ( B & C ) with the size of selected pathogens ( physical diameter , D p , for all viruses and aerodynamic diameter , D a , for M . tuberculosis ) as a lower limit for pathogen carriage ( A ) , measured size distributions of selected pathogens embedded in respiratory particles ( D – F ) , deposition properties of the respiratory tract ( ICPR model ) ( G ) , and ﬁltration eﬃcacy of face masks ( H ) . D – F : The pathogen size distributions were obtained from the original studies ( see legend ) , bin - normalized , and converted in pathogen entities per air volume . The legend further speciﬁes involved respiratory activities ( bold , black font ) and activities that might be involved as well ( gray font ) . The parameterization was applied to the pathogen size distributions by adapting the position ( s ) and width ( s ) of modes B2 , LT , and O1 ( with only slight changes ) and freely adjusting the mode height ( s ) . H : Face mask transmission curves were measured at high air velocity , with surgical mask transmissibility representing the average of three types of surgical masks and community mask transmissibility representing the average of three materials : velvet polyester , 2 layers of cotton jersey , and thin silk . 36 predominance of mode B2 without strong contributions by mode LT . This underlines a statement by Scheuch ( 2020 ) that ”breathing is enough” for the transmission of inﬂuenza . Furthermore consistent with our results ( Sect . III . B . 3 ) is that the cough - related inﬂuenza size dis - tribution involves the mode B2 as well as the modes LT and O1 , which both occur in relation to cough - ing . The low size resolution bears rather large uncer - tainties regarding the relative contributions from modes LT and O1 . Nevertheless , a co - occurrence of both these modes would be expected for coughing according to Sect . III . B . 3 . The upper size limit of the sampling at ∼ 10 µ m does not allow solid conclusions on the inﬂuenza abundance in modes O1 and particularly O2 . Overall , these results underline previous observations of inﬂuenza virions especially in the small aerosol size range and em - phasize that essentially all respiratory activities might be driving forces in the spread of this virus ( e . g . , Bischoﬀ et al . , 2013 ; Cowling et al . , 2013 ; Leung et al . , 2020 ; Mil - ton et al . , 2013 ; Shiu et al . , 2020 ; Yan et al . , 2018 ) . The four available SARS - CoV - 2 size distributions with at least two size bins based on studies by Santarpia et al . ( 2020a ) , Liu et al . ( 2020 ) , Lednicky et al . ( 2021 ) , and Chia et al . ( 2020 ) are summarized in Fig . 18F . In the studies by Santarpia et al . ( 2020a ) , Liu et al . ( 2020 ) , and Chia et al . ( 2020 ) , the sampling did not target speciﬁc respiratory activities , but was rather conducted inside hospital rooms with COVID - 19 patients . Presumably , the sampling probed a mixture of breathing , coughing ( a common symptom of COVID - 19 ) , and probably also speaking . Chia et al . ( 2020 ) speciﬁed that the sampled patients were coughing . In the study by Lednicky et al . ( 2021 ) , aerosol samples were collected inside a car driven by a COVID - 19 patient with a mild clinical course of the disease and , thus an unknown mixture of respiratory activities was probed . The size distributions show a sim - ilar bimodal shape and the mode B2 could be allocated to them rather clearly , which suggests that COVID - 19 is also transmissible by breathing ( Scheuch , 2020 ) . Further a second mode centered between the modes LT and O1 is resolved . This suggests that also the modes LT and / or O1 from speaking / singing or coughing can be drivers in COVID - 19 transmission . Generally , the cough - related in - ﬂuenza and both SARS - CoV - 2 size distributions show a rather similar bimodal shape , which might indicate mech - anistic analogies in transmission mechanisms of both dis - eases . Beyond aerosol emission and transport from host to host , the size - dependent deposition of pathogen - laden particles throughout the human respiratory tract is of critical importance . Figure 18G shows the established ICPR deposition model , distinguishing deposition in the alveolar , tracheobronchiolar , and head airways , which is driven by the size - dependent inﬂuences of diﬀusion , im - paction , and sedimentation particle losses . Here , a de - tailed understanding of the modality of the inhaled PSD FIG . 19 Eﬀects of particle deposition in respiratory tract and face mask ﬁltration on speaking - related particle size dis - tribution ( PSD , here number emission rate , Q N , adapted from Fig . 18B ) . Figure compares ( i ) PSD after emission , ( ii ) frac - tion of PSD deposited in respiratory tract ( compare Fig . 18G ) , and ( iii ) fraction of PSD deposited in respiratory tract af - ter ﬁltration through community masks , surgical masks , and FFP2 masks ( compare Fig . 18H ) . Only the mask ﬁltration and not the mask ﬁtting properties ( loose vs tight ) are taken into account . Background shading divides overall size range according to common deﬁnitions ( up to 100 µ m ) and a size spanning from the physical size of inﬂuenza and SARS - CoV - 2 virions ( ∼ 0 . 1 µ m ) to ∼ 5 µ m , which the fraction being partic - ularly relevant for far - ﬁeld transmission . ( Fig . 18B and C ) in combination with knowledge on those modes that presumably carry most of a given pathogen ( Fig . 18D , E and F ) allows to assess to what extend the pathogens reach their corresponding target sites in the respiratory tract . For example , alveolar macrophages are the target site for airborne infection with M . tuberculosis ( Lin and Flynn , 2010 ; Roy and Milton , 2004 ) . The com - bination of Fig . 18D and G shows that the carrier mode LT is co - located with a secondary maximum of alveo - lar deposition , underlining that the bacteria could reach the target directly in airborne state . Note further , that the modes O1 and O2 , for which Fig . 18D suggests that the bacteria are only sparsely present , corresponds with a size range in which the alveolar deposition approaches to zero . In this sense , mode LT appears to be the ’evolu - tionary optimized’ vehicle for the airborne spread of TB directly to its target sites . Finally , Fig . 18H completes the picture by illustrating the characteristic size - dependent ﬁltration eﬃciencies of selected face mask materials . Wearing face masks is a main measure to decelerate the spread of diseases , given that ( semi ) ballistic droplet spray and aerosol transmis - sion are major infection routes . Accordingly , the liter - 37 ature on the inﬂuence of face masks - especially in the context of the current COVID - 19 pandemic – has grown considerably ( e . g . , Asadi et al . , 2020b ; Cheng et al . , 2021 ; Clapp et al . , 2020 ; Drewnick et al . , 2020 ; Gandhi and Marr , 2021 ; Leith et al . , 2021 ; Li et al . , 2020 ; Lindsley et al . , 2021 ; Mitze et al . , 2020 ; Pan et al . , 2020 ; Rogak et al . , 2020 ) . The similarity between the size - dependent deposition in the respiratory tract and the face mask ﬁltration eﬃciency is obvious , which can be explained by the fact that the relevant particle loss mechanisms ( i . e . , diﬀusional , impaction , and sedimentation losses ) are comparatively ineﬀective in the range roughly between 100 to 500 nm . In the ﬁeld of atmospheric aerosol physics , this size band is known as the location of the so called ac - cumulation mode because particles tend to accumulate in here due to the minimum in particle loss / removal eﬃcien - cies ( e . g . , Cheng , 1997 ; He et al . , 2005 ; Lai , 2002 ; Seinfeld and Pandis , 2016 ) . Scheuch ( 2020 ) emphasized that this size band is particularly important as it is the co - location of the minimum in face mask eﬃciency and the maximum of the atmospheric lifetime of pathogen - laden particles . The peak of mode B2 falls within this range , which im - plies that it has on average the longest lifetime in the air as well as the largest transmissibility through com - mon face mask materials ( especially so called community masks ) . Face masks with high ﬁltration eﬃciencies ( e . g . , N95 / FFP2 ) show a much lower transmissibility in this particular size range and are thus particularly useful for preventing the airborne transmission of diseases such as COVID - 19 ( e . g . , Cheng et al . , 2021 ; Howard et al . , 2021 ; Lelieveld et al . , 2020 ; Nordsiek et al . , 2021 ) . Figure 19 visualizes the ﬁltration eﬀect of face masks on the size distribution of speaking - related particles emis - sion rates as shown in Fig . 18B . All PSDs – the initial speaking - related PSD and the PSDs after face mask ﬁl - tration – have been multiplied by the total deposition curve of the respiratory tract as shown in Fig . 18H . Thus , the ( black ) PSDs in Fig . 19B compare the deposited par - ticle fractions with and without face mask ﬁltration . Note that this assumes mask ﬁltration without leaks ( i . e . , a tight ﬁt of the mask ) . Beyond the ﬁltration eﬃciency of the mask materials , the tightness of the ﬁt and potential leakage between mask and face is of crucial importance for the overall mask performance ( e . g . , Shaﬀer and Ren - gasamy , 2009 ) . Clearly , all masks have a high eﬃcacy for large particles ( i . e . , larger ∼ 5 µ m ) . For the small parti - cle range ( i . e . , smaller ∼ 5 µ m ) , however , the transmission curves of community , surgical , and FFP2 masks show sig - niﬁcant diﬀerences . Note that these diﬀerences overlap with the size range of the modes B2 and LT , which are likely involved in the transmission of the pathogen shown in Fig . 18D , E , and F . IV . SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS A . Aerosol and droplet transmission of infectious human diseases ( 1 ) A critical review of deﬁnitions , nomenclature , and concepts regarding airborne or contact - free disease trans - mission was presented . Through this process we clariﬁed critical aspects of the discussion for eﬃcient transdisci - plinary exchange and collaboration between the medical and physical sciences ( e . g . , use of the term airborne , the continuity and overlap of respiratory aerosol and droplet size ranges , as well as droplet desiccation and hygroscop - icity ) . Moreover , we highlighted important knowledge gaps that currently hamper the quantitative assessment and prediction of the spread of pathogens . Improved con - nection between infectious disease medicine and a phys - ical or mechanistic understanding of respiratory emis - sions thus provides basis for improved control of disease transmission , including non - pharmaceutical intervention strategies ( e . g . mask type , ventilation , ﬁltration ) , espe - cially for diseases for which no eﬀective vaccination ex - ists . While we endeavor to provide tools to bring groups of scientists closer together , we acknowledge disciplinary bias is implicit and have written primarily from the per - spective of physical scientists . ( 2 ) Based on a comprehensive review and synthesis of the scientiﬁc literature , we developed a parameteriza - tion of particle emissions from the full respiratory tract . The parameterization requires only ﬁve lognormal modes for the size range from > 10 nm to ∼ 1000 µ m to eﬃ - ciently describe all PSDs available in published litera - ture . The parameterization was optimized in the course of a ’multi - dimensional ﬁtting’ to represent both number and volume size distributions . As a further development of Johnson et al . ( 2011 ) , the ﬁve lognormal modes can be subdivided in three categories that elucidate unique and diﬀerent particle formation mechanisms and sites in the respiratory tract . The bronchiolar modes B1 and B2 are formed in the terminal brochioles through ﬁlm bursting processes . The mode LT is presumably formed through vibrations and shear forces in the larynx and / or high tur - bulence and shear forces in the trachea . Modes O1 and O2 are formed by mouth , tongue , and lips movements . ( 3 ) Breathing is associated with a bimodal PSD ( B1 & B2 ) , whereas speaking and singing as well as coughing are associated with pentamodal PSDs ( B1 , B2 , LT , O1 , & O2 ) . Overall , the PSDs of all respiratory activities yield a consistent pattern . Respiratory activities show a characteristic , multimodal PSD shape , while the as - sociated particle concentrations and emission rates vary across orders of magnitude . ( 4 ) The variability among PSDs within a given respi - ratory activity can be explained by ( i ) the fact that the 38 FIG . 20 Illustration of near - and far - ﬁeld aerosol transmission in relation to the respiratory particle size distribution ( PSD ) and preventive measures : M = mask , D = distance , F = ﬁltration , and V = ventilation . Only the aerosol emission from the in - fected emitter is visualized . The approximated infection risks for the recipients are illustrated by colored circles ( red = highest risk > orange > yellow > green = lowest risk ) . Bottom panel shows speaking - related PSD ( adapted from Fig . 19B ) , which repre - sents particle concentration ( most relevant in near - ﬁeld ) and emission rate ( most relevant in far - ﬁeld ) that can be converted into each other by a constant factor ( see Table I ) . Blue dashed line in PSD panel shows that the travel range of exhaled particles ( for an exemplary emission velocity of 20 m s − 1 and emission height of 1 . 5 m ) in still air is strongly size - dependent ( D 2 relationship ) : large particles ( i . e . , > 100 µ m ) are exclusively relevant in near - ﬁeld , whereas smaller particles ( i . e . , < 100 µ m ) are relevant in both , near - and far - ﬁeld . Blue background shading in PSD panel illustrates qualitatively that particle concentrations decrease with distance from emitter due to dilution and mixing . Threshold at 100 nm marks the physical size of SARS - CoV - 2 and inﬂuenza virions . particles were measured under diﬀerent RH conditions and thus diﬀerent particle drying states after exhalation as well as by ( ii ) diﬀerences in mode height relative to each other in relation to breathing patterns and vocal - ization volumes . ( 5 ) The emission of pathogen - laden particles in the course of all respiratory activities can transmit diseases in the near - and far - ﬁeld . For near - ﬁeld aerosol trans - mission , the particle concentration in the exhaled puﬀs is of primary relevance . Here , our parameterization shows the following order for number concentrations ( C N ) : C N ( cough ) > C N ( speak ) ≈ C N ( breathe ) and for volume concentrations ( C V ) : C V ( cough ) ≈ C V ( speak ) > C V ( breathe ) . For far - ﬁeld aerosol transmission , the par - ticle emission rate – which strongly depend on the fre - quency of a given respiratory activity – is of primary relevance . Here , our parameterization shows the follow - ing order for number emission rates ( Q N ) : Q N ( speak ) > Q N ( cough ) > Q N ( breathe ) and for volume emission rates ( Q V ) : Q V ( speak ) > Q V ( cough ) > Q V ( breathe ) . 39 ( 6 ) An understanding of the multimodal shape of the respiration PSDs provides novel mechanistic insight into airborne disease transmission and the eﬃcacy of preven - tative measures . For common aerosol - transmissible dis - eases , modes were identiﬁed through which the pathogens are most likely transmitted : e . g . , cough - related mode LT for tuberculosis ; breath - , speaking - / singing - , and cough - related modes B2 , LT , and O1 for inﬂuenza and SARS - CoV - 2 . ( 7 ) Public health recommendations can beneﬁt from an improved understanding of the respiration PSDs pa - rameterized here and through an updated view of the mechanisms of particle mixing and transmission as il - lustrated in Fig . 20 . Larger droplets ( > 100 µ m ) are not generally inhalable , have rapid settling velocity , and are thus relevant only in the near - ﬁeld where ballistic trajec - tories can launch them onto nearby surfaces or directly onto mucosal membranes of the recipient . For respira - tory particles in this size regime , even relatively loose ﬁtting masks ( i . e . surgical - style ) or face shields are suf - ﬁcient for protection ( e . g . , Cappa et al . , 2021 ) . Smaller aerosols ( < 100 µ m ) can be inhaled , have lower settling velocity and so can remain suspended for many minutes to hours , and are thus relevant in both the near - and far - ﬁelds . In the near - ﬁeld , aerosols are concentrated in the breathing zone of the emitting person , but rapidly mix into the full room volume . In both near - and far - ﬁeld , improved masks ( i . e . FFP2 or N95 style respirators ) are most appropriate to guard against aerosol inhalation ( e . g . , Bischoﬀ et al . , 2013 ; Cheng et al . , 2021 ; Goldberg et al . , 2021 ) , and physical barriers are not very eﬀective . In the far - ﬁeld , aerosols that build up in poorly ventilated rooms ( e . g . , He et al . , 2005 ; Helleis et al . , 2021 ; Lai , 2002 , and references therein ) can also be removed via ventila - tion and ﬁltration , but these added controls provide little beneﬁt in the near - ﬁeld . Appropriate control measures and non - pharmaceutical intervention tools , such as use of high - quality face masks , physical distancing , ventilation , and room ﬁltration should thus be matched to the type of space involved and the sizes and properties of the res - piratory particles relevant for a given respiratory disease . Other engineering controls , such as upper - room germici - dal UV light , can also be deployed as one of a layered strategy for virus inactivation , with primary application against far - ﬁeld aerosols ( e . g . , Miller et al . , 2013 ) . It is also important to note that far - ﬁeld aerosol transmis - sion is almost exclusively an indoor challenge , because dilution as a function of increasing distance from emitter becomes so large outdoors that infection risk is dramat - ically lower ( although not to zero , depending on wind patterns and other variables ) ( e . g . , Bulfone et al . , 2021 ; Maggiore et al . , 2021 ) . The near - ﬁeld aerosol transmis - sion , however , is relevant under both , indoor and outdoor settings . B . Aerosol and droplet transmission of COVID - 19 via SARS - CoV - 2 virus ( 1 ) No deﬁnitive proof exists that SARS - CoV - 2 ( or almost any other individual viral pathogens ) is trans - mitted by a speciﬁc transmission mechanism ( Leung , 2021 ) . That said , considerable evidence suggests that the transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 proceeds primarily through aerosol particles in the size range of ∼ 0 . 1 to ∼ 10 µ m , pos - sibly dominated by near - ﬁeld exposure , but with impor - tant contribution from far - ﬁeld mixing in rooms ( e . g . , Allen and Marr , 2020 ; Azimi et al . , 2021 ; Chen et al . , 2020 ; Hwang et al . , 2021 ; Klompas et al . , 2020 ; Kutter et al . , 2020 ; Kwon et al . , 2020 ; Lednicky et al . , 2021 , 2020 ; Lee et al . , 2020 ; Lu et al . , 2020 ; Miller et al . , 2020 ; Prather et al . , 2020b ; Tang et al . , 2021 , 2020 ) . The parameterization here suggests that the source of these particles is PSD modes B2 , LT and / or O1 , orig - inating from multiple respiratory activities , including breathing , speaking / singing , and coughing . Fecal ma - terial aerosolized in broadly similar size ranges ( (cid:46) 10 µ m ) have also been suggested to be important for disease spread in some cases ( e . g . , Gormley et al . , 2021 ; Kang et al . , 2020 ) , but was not discussed in detail here . ( 2 ) The relevance of SARS - CoV - 2 - carrying aerosol particles in the size range of ∼ 0 . 1 to ∼ 10 µ m , com - bined with the variable ﬁltration eﬃciency and poor av - erage ﬁt quality of so - called community face masks in this size range imply that tight - ﬁtting , high eﬃciency masks such as N95 / FFP2 are particularly important for mitigating the airborne transmission of COVID - 19 ( e . g . , Cheng et al . , 2021 ; Drewnick et al . , 2020 ) . The small size of these particles also supports the suggestion that in - creased ventilation and room - ﬁltration will provide com - munity health beneﬁt against COVID - 19 ( e . g . , Curtius et al . , 2021 ; Helleis et al . , 2021 ; Mathai et al . , 2021 ; Nis - sen et al . , 2020 ; Rothamer et al . , 2021 ) . ( 3 ) With regard to studies suggesting that the upper respiratory tract ( i . e . , the nose ) is the initial target site for SARS - CoV - 2 ( e . g . , Hou et al . , 2020 ; Wolfel et al . , 2020 ) , the particle modes LT and O1 may be particularly important because they overlap with the size range of highest deposition probability in the upper airways . ( 4 ) Speaking is a frequent activity of everyday life , often with other persons in close proximity , and is also associated with high particle emission rates . Therefore , speaking can play a particularly important role in both near - and far - ﬁeld transmission of COVID - 19 . A sum - mary of the aerosol emission rates and particle sizes , as shown supports the ideas that speaking is likely an stronger driver of the pandemic than was generally con - sidered early in the development of the COVID - 19 pan - demic . 40 ( 5 ) Remarkably similar bimodal distributions ob - served for inﬂuenza and SARS - CoV - 2 in the size range of the modes B2 , LT and / or O1 indicate analogies in the airborne transmission routes of these two pathogens . This is a critical piece in context of available preven - tative against each , because it shows that observations about mask - wearing and ventilation can be leveraged for tremendous public health beneﬁt against seasonal in - ﬂuenza as well as other emerging respiratory diseases . ( 6 ) Together , these ﬁndings ( e . g . , Fig . 20 ) should be implemented in updated and sophisticated hygiene con - cepts allowing common work and life in times of pan - demics . C . Open questions and research perspectives ( 1 ) Experimental data on respiratory PSDs , includ - ing relevant variability , should be extended to reduce un - certainties across individuals and with respect to diﬀer - ent respiratory diseases . Data coverage of the smallest mode B1 ( centered at ∼ 70 nm ) and largest modes O1 and O2 ( centered at ∼ 10 µ m & ∼ 100 µ m ) is especially sparse . Further , most available measurements have fo - cused on a limited portion of the full range of respiratory particle sizes ( < 10 nm to > 1000 µ m ) . We propose that systematic experiments across the full size should be con - ducted for diﬀerent respiratory activities and a large co - hort of volunteers ( including healthy and individual dis - ease groups ) to consolidate our knowledge on the overall modality , mode ratios and their variability as a function of respiratory activities . A number of instruments will be required to span the full range of particle sizes ( e . g . , Johnson et al . , 2011 ) . Within the design of these exper - iments , care should be taken so that instrument PSDs overlap for cross - validation . Instruments with high size resolution are preferred to resolve details of the PSDs , which ideally can be acquired at high time - resolution to also observe diﬀerences in PSD properties as a function of rapidly changing emission mechanisms . ( 2 ) Existing measurements have been conducted under widely diﬀerent experimental conditions , which hampers the comparison across studies and individuals . Standard - ized operational procedures for the analysis of respiratory aerosols would therefore be desirable ( e . g . , as outlined for atmospheric aerosols in Wiedensohler et al . , 2014 ) . One eﬀort in this area was recently conducted as a part of a journal special issues focused on standardizing bioaerosol measurements , however , this was only a ﬁrst step , with signiﬁcant follow - up required ( e . g . , Alsved et al . , 2020a ; Cox et al . , 2020 ; Huﬀman et al . , 2020 ; Huﬀman and Ratnesar - Shumate , 2020 ; Mainelis , 2020 ; Santarpia et al . , 2020b ; Santl - Temkiv et al . , 2019 ) . Important aspects of such a standardization might be : ( i ) deﬁned drying con - ditions e . g . , < 40 % RH , which is a rather reproducible state , ( ii ) isokinetic and isoaxial aerosol sampling , es - pecially for large particles , ( iii ) corrections for particle losses in the experimental setup ( von der Weiden et al . , 2009 ) , ( iv ) documentation of the precise sampling condi - tions ( i . e . , RH , temperature ) , and ( v ) a documentation of basic physiological , spirometric , and demographic pa - rameters . ( 3 ) Recorded measurements of respiratory activities have thus far been mostly standardized maneuvers and , therefore reﬂect ’normal live’ emissions only imperfectly . Therefore , continuous measurements of respiratory emis - sion from volunteers during diﬀerent everyday activities ( e . g . , conversation , oﬃce work , at school , gym workout ) would be very useful to better assess infection risks under real - world conditions . ( 4 ) Edwards et al . ( 2021 ) showed signiﬁcant diﬀerences in SARS - CoV - 2 aerosol emission rate as a function of age and several physiological factors , but otherwise data is still relatively sparse regarding the physical basis to explain why some individuals act as viral aerosol super - spreaders . For example , it is still relatively uncertain to what extent the superspreading of many diseases by certain individuals correlates with particularly high emis - sion rates of exhaled particles overall and why this might be the case . Dedicated studies on the high inter - subject variability of emission rates would be important to close gaps in this area of knowledge . ( 5 ) Data on the chemical composition of saliva and ELF and its variability is sparse . Further experiments are needed as the chemical microenvironment plays a primary role for the decay of viability of the embedded pathogens during airborne transport . ( 6 ) Data on the hygroscopic properties of mucosali - vary particles and their shrinkage or growth under chang - ing RH conditions , including the inﬂuence of potential hysteresis eﬀects upon eﬄorescence and deliquescence , is sparse . Instruments reaching high RH , such as a high - humidity tandem diﬀerential mobility analyzer ( HHT - DMA ) ( Mikhailov et al . , 2020 ; Mikhailov and Vlasenko , 2020 ) or similar , may allow investigation of these param - eters . ( 7 ) The precise pathogen emission mechanisms and sites are still largely uncertain . In this sense , our assign - ment of certain modes and likely emission mechanisms and sites ( i . e . , B1 , B2 , LT , O1 , and O2 ) can be con - sidered as preliminary estimates . While the processes behind mode B2 are rather well documented , the origin of mode B1 is widely unknown . Additionally , the inter - play of emission from the larynx and trachea , which we combined here in mode LT , present large uncertainties . Finally , the precise mechanisms and sites of droplet for - mation in the mouth that generate modes O1 and O2 are poorly understood . ( 8 ) Further experimental studies on the pathogen size 41 distributions and their mixing in the carrier PSD are highly needed as they ( i ) provide suggestions on droplet formation mechanisms and sites in the respiratory tract , ( ii ) allow the assessment of which PSD modes are most relevant as drivers of pathogen spread , and ( iii ) help the identiﬁcation of the most likely deposition sites in the respiratory tract in relation to data on pathogen tropism ( e . g . , Hou et al . , 2020 ; Nomaguchi et al . , 2012 ) . ( 9 ) A better understanding of respiratory particle transport and dilution in air as a function of particle size will be required to help model the relative risk of infection in both indoor and outdoor settings . Without the abil - ity to detect the small fraction of respiratory particles , it is impossible to use particle sizing instruments alone to observe respiratory emissions in a room . Thus , improved instrumental techniques will be required to selectively an - alyze respiratory particles amidst the overwhelming pool of existing aerosols in any room or outdoor air volume . Further , an improved understanding will be required on the quantitative range of how many pathogen entities ( e . g . , virions ) for each disease are necessary for infection via the inhalation of the aerosol phase or deposition of the droplet phase ( Jones and Brosseau , 2015 ; Rudnick and Milton , 2003 ; Wells , 1955 ) . ( 10 ) Improved understanding of environmental viabil - ity of pathogens , as a function of aerosol size and compo - sition , RH , temperature , and UV ﬂux , will aid the esti - mation of infectivity as a function of real - world parame - ters ( e . g . , van Doremalen et al . , 2020 ; Fears et al . , 2020a ; Santarpia et al . , 2020c ) .
