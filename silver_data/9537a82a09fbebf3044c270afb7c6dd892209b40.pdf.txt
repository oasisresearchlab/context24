Current Topics Regulation of Actin Filament Dynamics by Actin Depolymerizing Factor / Cofilin and Actin - Interacting Protein 1 : New Blades for Twisted Filaments † Shoichiro Ono * Department of Pathology , Emory Uni V ersity , Atlanta , Georgia 30322 Recei V ed April 14 , 2003 ; Re V ised Manuscript Recei V ed June 19 , 2003 ABSTRACT : Actin depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) / cofilin enhances turnover of actin filaments by severing and depolymerizing filaments . A number of proteins functionally interact with ADF / cofilin to modulate the dynamics of actin filaments . Actin - interacting protein 1 ( AIP1 ) has emerged as a conserved WD - repeat protein that specifically enhances ADF / cofilin - induced actin dynamics . Interaction of AIP1 with actin was originally characterized by a yeast two - hybrid system . However , biochemical studies revealed its unique activity on ADF / cofilin - bound actin filaments . AIP1 alone has negligible effects on actin filament dynamics , whereas in the presence of ADF / cofilin , AIP1 enhances filament fragmentation by capping ends of severed filaments . Studies in model organisms demonstrated that AIP1 genetically interacts with ADF / cofilin and participates in several actin - dependent cellular events . The crystal structure of AIP1 revealed its unique structure with two seven - bladed (cid:226) - propeller domains . Thus , AIP1 is a new class of actin regulatory proteins that selectively enhances ADF / cofilin - dependent actin filament dynamics . 1 . Regulation of Actin Filament Dynamics by Actin Depolymerizing Factor / Cofilin Actin is one of the major cytoskeletal proteins in eukary - otes . Actin polymerizes into a filamentous form and serves as a core of the microfilament system . Dynamic assembly and disassembly of the actin cytoskeleton are required for a number of biological processes , such as cell division , cell motility , endocytosis , and morphogenesis . Actin by itself undergoes polymerization and depolymerization under physi - ological conditions . However , the rate of filament turnover by actin itself is much slower than that of actin filaments in V i V o . Therefore , a number of actin regulatory proteins regulate nucleation , depolymerization , and fragmentation when rapid reorganization of the actin filaments is needed ( 1 - 4 ) . ADF / cofilin 1 is one of the essential factors for enhancing actin filament turnover ( 5 - 8 ) . ADF / cofilin weakly severs actin filaments without capping ends ( 9 - 16 ) , thereby increasing the number of free filament ends where polym - erization and depolymerization occur ( Figure 1 ) . It also enhances the rate of monomer dissociation from the pointed ends ( 17 , 18 ) ( Figure 1 ) . Most ADF / cofilin proteins exhibit stronger depolymerizing activity at pHs above 7 . 5 than at lower pHs ( 11 , 12 , 19 ) . This pH dependence is due to an increase in the critical concentration for the actin - ADF / cofilin complex at high pHs ( 20 , 21 ) . ADF / cofilin binds preferentially to ADP - bound actin ( 22 ) and inhibits its † This work was supported by grants from the National Science Foundation ( MCB - 0110464 ) and the National Institutes of Health ( AR48615 ) to S .

Electron microscopic observations revealed that filament binding by ADF / cofilin changes the twist of the actin filaments ( 24 ) or stabilizes a preexisting tilted conformation of actin subunits ( 25 ) , and weakens lateral contacts in the filaments ( 26 ) . An ADF / cofilin - induced conformational change in actin subunits was also observed in solution ( 27 , 28 ) . Structures of ADF / cofilin proteins have a core of four or five (cid:226) - sheets , which is surrounded by four or five helices ( 29 - 32 ) ( Figure 2 ) . This structural fold is very similar to that of the individual segments of the gelsolin family of actin - severing / capping proteins ( 33 ) . The presence of two actin - binding sites , the G / F - site and the F - site ( Figure 2 ) , has been demonstrated by various methods , including site - directed mutagenesis , cross - linking , peptide competition , electron microscopy , and synchrotron footprinting . The G / F - site that includes the long helix R 3 and the N - terminus ( Figure 2 ) is responsible for both G - and F - actin binding and sufficient for depolymerizing activity ( 34 - 39 ) . The F - site , including the C - terminus and the loop ( F - loop ) at the opposite side of the G / F - site ( Figure 2 ) , is required in addition to the G / F - site for F - actin binding and severing activity ( 37 , 40 - 42 ) . However , in the absence of the structure of the actin - ADF / cofilin complex at atomic resolution , the structural basis of severing and depolymerization by ADF / cofilin is not fully understood . The ADF / cofilin proteins have been demonstrated to be involved in many cellular events in which rapid turnover or reorganization of actin filaments is required . In migrating cells , ADF / cofilin is localized to the lamellipodia ( 43 , 44 ) where it severs filaments and increases the number of exposed ends ( 45 - 47 ) or enhances turnover of the Arp2 / 3 - mediated dendritic network of actin filaments ( 48 ) . Over - expression of ADF / cofilin enhances cell motility ( 49 , 50 ) , whereas genetic ablation of ADF / cofilin impairs cell motility F IGURE 1 : Current model of the regulation of actin dynamics by ADF / cofilin , CAP1 , profilin , and AIP1 . ADF / cofilin preferentially binds to ADP - actin , enhances depolymerization from the pointed ends , and severs filaments . Although ADF / cofilin inhibits exchange of actin - bound nucleotide , profilin and CAP1 enhance exchange of actin - bound ADP with ATP and promote barbed end elongation .

Recently , Dawe et al . demonstrated that ADF / cofilin controls the polarity of cell migration ( 52 ) . In addition , ADF / cofilin is required for cytokinesis ( 53 - 55 ) , endocytosis ( 56 ) , and myofibril assembly ( 57 ) and is implicated in many diseases ( reviewed in refs 58 and 59 ) . As ADF / cofilin is involved in many fundamental cellular activities , mutations in ADF / cofilin genes cause lethality in yeast ( 60 , 61 ) , the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster ( 53 ) , and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans ( 62 ) . Multicellular organisms have multiple ADF / cofilin iso - forms that have redundant or nonredundant functions ( re - viewed in refs 6 and 59 ) . Mammals have three ADF / cofilin isoforms [ ADF , cofilin - 1 ( non - muscle - type cofilin ) , and cofilin - 2 ( muscle - type cofilin ) ( 63 - 66 ) ] , while green plants have more than 10 isoforms ( reviewed in refs 8 and 67 ) . These isoforms are often expressed in different tissues and show quantitative differences in actin depolymerizing activity ( 21 , 66 , 68 , 69 ) . In C . elegans , UNC - 60A , the nonmuscle isoform , has strong depolymerizing activity and is required for early embryonic development , while UNC - 60B , the muscle isoform , has weaker activity and is required specif - ically for myofibril assembly ( 55 ) . Isoform - specific functions of ADF / cofilin in other organisms are yet to be examined . 2 . Regulators of ADF / Cofilin ADF / cofilin interacts with a number of cellular factors that influence actin cytoskeletal dynamics . Phosphorylation of ADF / cofilin at a conserved serine residue near the N - terminus inhibits its actin binding activity ( 70 , 71 ) . The N - terminus of ADF / cofilin is predicted to be an actin - binding site ( 72 ) . Introduction of an acidic residue in the N - terminal region of ADF / cofilin greatly reduces its affinity for actin ( 20 , 40 , 73 ) . In vertebrates , LIM - kinases and TES kinases are specific for ADF / cofilin and mediate various signals for remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton ( reviewed in refs 74 and 75 ) . On the other hand , dephosphorylation of ADF / cofilin is induced by many stimuli , but their signaling components are poorly understood ( reviewed in ref 76 ) . Effects of pharmacological phosphatase inhibitors on de - phosphorylation of ADF / cofilin are not consistent among different cell types ( 77 - 80 ) . Recently , a specific ADF / cofilin phosphatase , Slingshot , has been identified ( 81 ) . In addition , 14 - 3 - 3 œ binds to phosphorylated cofilin and prevents de - phosphorylation by a phosphatase ( 82 ) . However , how these regulators participate in the previously reported pathways for ADF / cofilin dephosphorylation is not known . Phosphoinositides , such as phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bis - phosphate ( PIP2 ) , bind to ADF / cofilin and compete with actin ( 83 ) . A PIP2 binding site on ADF / cofilin is mapped to long helix R 3 ( 84 - 86 ) and several other positively charged residues ( 86 ) which overlap with the actin - binding surface . At high concentrations , PIP2 inhibits the interaction between ADF / cofilin and actin in V itro . The activity of chicken cofilin to reorganize the actin cytoskeleton in microinjected cultured cells is significantly inhibited by its preincubation with PIP2 ( 87 ) . However , in V i V o , the role of PIP2 in the regulation of ADF / cofilin has not been established . Tropomyosin competes with ADF / cofilin for F - actin binding and inhibits depolymerization ( 9 , 88 - 92 ) . In yeasts , cofilin is restricted to cortical actin patches ( 61 ) , while tropomyosin is localized to actin cables ( 93 ) . However , in tropomyosin mutant cells , cofilin is localized to a cable - like structure ( 94 ) . In C . elegans , tropomyosin is important for stabilization of actin filaments because tropomyosin protects them from ADF / cofilin ( 92 ) . In migrating cells , ADF / cofilin is enriched in the lamellipodia near the leading edge ( 43 , 44 ) , whereas tropomyosin is depleted from the leading edge and localized to proximal regions of the lamellipodia and the stress fibers ( 95 ) . Thus , tropomyosin spatially segregates stable filaments from dynamic filaments to establish com - partments of functionally distinct cytoskeleton in a cell ( reviewed in ref 96 ) . However , vertebrates have more than 40 tropomyosin isoforms , and one of the nonmuscle isoform is colocalized with ADF / cofilin to actin filaments in the lamellipodia ( 97 ) , suggesting that not all tropomyosins compete with ADF / cofilin for F - actin binding . In addition to these regulators of ADF / cofilin , several actin - binding proteins have recently been shown to col - laborate with ADF / cofilin to promote actin filament dynamics ( Figure 1 ) . Profilin binds to G - actin , enhances exchange of actin - bound ADP with ATP , and promotes filament growth from the barbed ends . However , when the barbed ends are capped , profilin sequesters actin monomers ( reviewed in ref 98 ) . Profilin competes with ADF / cofilin for G - actin binding ( 14 , 99 ) and enhances exchange of actin - bound nucleotide in the presence of ADF / cofilin , thereby increasing the rate of actin turnover synergistically with ADF / cofilin ( 100 ) ( Figure 1 ) . Cyclase - associated protein ( CAP ) sequesters actin monomers by binding to G - actin through its C - terminal region ( reviewed in ref 101 ) that contains a WH2 ( WASP - homology 2 ) domain ( 102 ) . Recently , Moriyama and Yahara ( 103 ) demonstrated that the N - terminal domain of CAP binds to the actin - cofilin complex and accelerates actin depolym - erization from the pointed ends ( Figure 1 ) . Furthermore , the C - terminal domain of CAP enhances exchange of actin - bound ADP with ATP and promotes barbed end elongation , thus enhancing rapid subunit turnover ( Figure 1 ) . Actin - interacting protein 1 ( AIP1 ) is a unique protein that enhances filament severing only in the presence of ADF / cofilin . The function of AIP1 is discussed in the following sections in detail . 3 . Enhancement of ADF / Cofilin - Dependent Actin Filament Disassembly by AIP1 AIP1 was originally identified in yeast as one of actin - interacting proteins from a two - hybrid screen ( 104 ) . Subse - quently , AIP1 was rediscovered as a protein that binds to ADF / cofilin by affinity chromatography ( 105 ) or a yeast two - hybrid system ( 106 ) and as a high - copy number suppressor of a mutant cofilin allele in yeast ( 107 ) . In yeasts , the AIP1 gene is not essential for viability , whereas a deletion of AIP1 is synthetic lethal with mutant cofilin alleles ( 106 , 107 ) . In C . elegans , AIP1 is encoded by the unc - 78 gene and shows genetic interaction with the unc - 60B ADF / cofilin gene ( 108 ) . This genetic evidence strongly suggests that AIP1 and ADF / cofilin functionally interact in V i V o . Biochemical studies have revealed that AIP1 collaborates with ADF / cofilin to disassemble actin filaments ( 105 , 106 , 109 ) . AIP1 alone has negligible effects on the dynamics of actin filaments . However , in the presence of ADF / cofilin , it induces extensive disassembly of actin filaments . Electron microscopy showed that AIP1 and ADF / cofilin increased a Current Topics Biochemistry , Vol . 42 , No . 46 , 2003 13365 population of short filaments ( 105 , 109 ) , suggesting that filament disassembly is due to enhanced filament fragmenta - tion . Okada et al . ( 110 ) demonstrated that Xenopus AIP1 binds to filament ends and inhibits elongation from the barbed ends without affecting ADF / cofilin’s severing activity . Therefore , enhanced filament fragmentation by AIP1 is caused by its barbed end capping activity that prevents elongation and reannealing of the severed filaments ( Figure 1 ) . AIP1 appears to recognize the ends of ADF / cofilin - bound filaments rather than ADP - actin subunits at the ends of ADF / cofilin - severed filaments , because AIP1 does not prevent reannealing of mechanically fragmented ADP - actin in the absence of ADF / cofilin ( 110 ) . C . elegans AIP1 ( UNC - 78 ) weakly enhances monomer dissociation from filaments , suggesting that AIP1 has activity to enhance ADF / cofilin - mediated filament turnover ( 111 ) . In addition , UNC - 78 / AIP1 does not enhance depolymerization by mutants of ADF / cofilin which binds to G - actin , but not to F - actin , suggesting filament binding by ADF / cofilin is required for AIP1 to interact with filaments ( 111 ) . UNC - 78 / AIP1 shows prefer - ential interaction with a specific ADF / cofilin isoform ( 111 ) . Enhancement of filament disassembly by UNC - 78 / AIP1 is very efficient in the presence of UNC - 60B , a muscle - specific C . elegans isoform of ADF / cofilin ( 57 ) but not remarkable in the presence of UNC - 60A , a ubiquitously expressed isoform that has strong depolymerizing activity on its own ( 55 , 69 ) . Thus , in multicellular organisms , AIP1 and ADF / cofilin may interact in an isoform - specific manner . The AIP1 - binding site on actin is mapped to subdomains 3 and 4 by the yeast two - hybrid system ( 104 ) . The cofilin - binding site on G - actin is localized to subdomains 1 and 3 by molecular dynamics simulation and biochemical competi - tion with gelsolin segment - 1 that binds to the same region of G - actin ( 72 ) . In addition , electron cryomicroscopy revealed that cofilin interacts with F - actin at two sites : subdomains 1 and 3 of the upper and subdomains 2 and 1 of the lower actin subunits ( 24 , 41 ) . Biochemical analysis also showed two cofilin - binding sites on F - actin ( 112 , 113 ) . Thus , the AIP1 - binding site in subdomain 3 overlaps with the cofilin - binding site , while that in subdomain 4 is unique for AIP1 binding . Nevertheless , since mapping of the AIP1 - binding site on actin was determined as yeast two - hybrid interactions , endogenously expressed cofilin or other proteins could mediate the interactions . AIP1 cosediments with F - actin with low affinity ( estimated dissociation constant of 15 (cid:237) M ) ( 109 ) , and cosedimentation is enhanced in the presence of cofilin ( 105 , 106 ) . However , in these studies , cosedimentation of AIP1 with F - actin did not reach saturation , and in the presence of cofilin , a large amount of F - actin is disassembled . Therefore , the stoichiometry and affinity of binding between AIP1 and actin remain unclear . 4 . Structure of AIP1 Orthologs of AIP1 have been identified in a wide range of eukaryotic species . They have 597 - 615 amino acids that are 20 - 95 % identical . AIP1s have been predicted to contain up to 10 WD repeats that match the consensus sequence ( 114 ) . WD repeats are found in a wide range of proteins , and they are believed to fold into a (cid:226) - propeller structure in which each repeat corresponds to a single blade containing a four - stranded antiparallel (cid:226) - sheet ( 114 ) . Recently deter - mined crystal structures of yeast AIP1 ( 137 ) and C . elegans AIP1 ( UNC - 78 ) ( S . Vorobiev , K . Mohri , S . Ono , and S . C . Almo , manuscript in preparation ) revealed that AIP1 indeed folds into a (cid:226) - propeller , but surprisingly that it has two seven - bladed (cid:226) - propeller domains totaling 14 blades in a single molecule ( Figure 3 ) . The two domains are connected with a hinge and slightly twisted . AIP1 is the first protein to be characterized as a (cid:226) - propeller protein with two propeller domains in a single molecule . Other WD repeat proteins , such as the (cid:226) - subunit of trimeric G - protein ( 115 - 117 ) , the p40 subunit of the Arp2 / 3 complex ( 118 ) , and the CDC4 ubiquitin ligase ( 119 ) , have seven or eight repeats ( blades ) in a single propeller . The (cid:226) - propeller fold is also present in other nonhomologous proteins , but only four to eight blades have been found to date in a single molecule ( 120 ) . Interestingly , from sequence analysis , a protein with 16 WD repeats is predicted ( 114 ) . Therefore , the structure of AIP1 suggests that other WD repeat proteins with more than nine repeats could have multiple (cid:226) - propeller domains . Functional residues of AIP1 have not yet been identified . In addition , no sequence motif for actin binding has been proposed for AIP1 . Therefore , the structure of AIP1 will be very important in the study of its function and molecular interactions with actin and ADF / cofilin . Four mutations in the C . elegans unc - 78 gene that cause disorganization of the myofibril structure have been reported ( 108 ) . However , recombinant UNC - 78 proteins with these mutations become insoluble when they are expressed in Escherichia coli ( K . Mohri and S . Ono , unpublished observations ) , suggesting that the structure , rather than the functional residues , is altered by the mutations . Structure - based mutagenesis analy - sis of surface residues should be a straightforward approach to identifying functional sites on AIP1 . 5 . Cell Biological Function of AIP1 5 . 1 . Yeasts . As briefly described above , the budding yeast Saccharomyces cere V isiae AIP1 gene , AIP1 , is nonessential and genetically interacts with the cofilin gene . However , the function of AIP1 is not clear because deletion of the AIP1 gene does not cause detectable growth or morphological defects ( 106 , 107 ) . AIP1 is localized to cortical actin patches where cofilin is also localized ( 61 ) . Its localization to cortical patches is dependent on actin and cofilin as AIP1 becomes F IGURE 3 : Structure of C . elegans AIP1 ( UNC - 78 ) ( Protein Data Bank entry 1NR0 ; the coordinates will be released upon publication of the structure by S . Vorobiev , K . Mohri , S . Ono , and S . Almo ) . The chain is depicted as gradual changes in color from the N - terminus ( blue ) to the C - terminus ( red ) . Blades 1 - 14 are denoted .

On the other hand , in the absence of AIP1 , cofilin is found in actin cables where cofilin is not normally found ( 106 , 107 ) , suggesting that AIP1 has a role in restricting the localization of cofilin to cortical patches . Deletion of AIP1 is synthetic lethal with the V159N mutation of the ACT1 actin gene , which decreases rates of actin filament turnover ( 94 ) , suggesting that AIP1 supports enhancement of actin turnover . It has not yet been demonstrated whether AIP1 has a role in endocytosis in which cofilin is required ( 56 ) . An AIP1 sequence has been identified in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe , but functional study on this gene is not reported . 5 . 2 . Slime Molds . In Physarum polycephalum , an AIP1 ortholog , p66 , was identified as a heat shock protein ( 121 ) . Upon heat shock , the Physarum amoeboid cells reorganize the actin cytoskeleton and undergo transformation into dormant microcysts . p66 is strongly upregulated by heat shock and becomes associated with cytoplasmic actin rods ( 122 ) . Partially purified p66 coprecipitates with F - actin ( 122 ) , but highly purified p66 does not ( 121 ) , suggesting the presence of a factor ( s ) , possibly cofilin , that mediates interaction of p66 with F - actin . These reports suggest that Physarum p66 is involved in actin reorganization during microcyst formation . However , its mechanism and the role of cofilin in this process have not been reported . Intracellular localization of Dictyostelium AIP1 ( DAIP1 ) is very similar to that of cofilin ( 123 , 124 ) , and it is enriched in dynamic actin - rich structures such as leading edges of motile cells , phagocytic cups , and macropinosomes , but not in a cleavage furrow ( 125 ) . DAIP1 is also colocalized with cofilin to hyperosmotic stress - induced cortical actin bundles and dimethyl sulfoxide - induced intranuclear actin rods ( 109 ) . These suggest that DAIP1 closely collaborates with cofilin in reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton . A null mutation of DAIP1 causes reduced rates of growth , cytokinesis , fluid - phase uptake , phagocytosis , and cell motility ( 125 ) . However , unlike in yeasts and C . elegans ( see below ) , the localization of cofilin is not changed in DAIP1 - null cells ( 125 ) . Over - expression of DAIP1 enhances fluid - phase uptake ( 125 ) and partially impairs cytokinesis ( 109 ) . These cellular events require dynamic regulation of actin filaments , suggesting that DAIP1 is important in enhancing the filament dynamics by disassembling filaments . Nonetheless , the phenotypes of DAIP1 - null cells are not severe , suggesting that DAIP1 has a supporting role in actin dynamics mediated by cofilin and / or other actin regulatory proteins . 5 . 3 . C . elegans . Two AIP1 genes are predicted in the C . elegans genome sequence . One of them ( C04F6 . 4 ) has been identified as the unc - 78 gene ( 108 ) . The unc - 78 locus was originally defined from mutant screens for muscle - affecting uncoordinated worms ( 126 , 127 ) . An unc - 78 - null mutation causes severe disorganization of actin filaments and forma - tion of actin aggregates in body wall muscle , resulting in a defect in muscle contractile activity ( 108 ) ( Figure 4 ) . Point mutations in the WD repeats of the UNC - 78 protein also cause similar , but weaker , phenotypes as compared to the null mutant . unc - 78 mutations enhance the motility defects of the unc - 60B ADF / cofilin mutants , which also exhibit disorganized actin filaments in body wall muscle ( 57 ) . In addition , UNC - 60B ( ADF / cofilin ) is mislocalized to actin aggregates in unc - 78 mutants ( 108 ) , while it is normally localized in the diffuse cytoplasm and to a part of myofibrils ( 57 , 92 ) . UNC - 78 is expressed in body wall muscle and other muscle tissues and localized to thin filaments ( 111 ) . Thus , UNC - 78 / AIP1 functionally interacts with UNC - 60B to organize actin filaments in muscle cells . Interestingly , UNC - 78 is colocalized with actin in unc - 60B - null mutant muscle cells , suggesting that there is an unknown mechanism that mediates interaction between UNC - 78 and actin . Functional analysis of the second AIP1 isoform ( K08F9 . 2 ) is not reported except that large - scale RNA interference projects yielded no detectable phenotype for this gene ( 128 , 129 ) . 5 . 4 . Vertebrates . In Xenopus embryos , AIP1 ( XAIP1 ) is localized to the cell cortex , diffuse cytoplasm , and nuclei ( 105 ) . During the first cleavage , XAIP1 is accumulated in the cytoplasmic side of the progressing cleavage furrow ( 105 ) where Xenopus ADF / cofilin ( XAC ) is also enriched ( 54 ) and active actin polymerization occurs ( 130 ) . Microinjection of blastomeres with purified XAIP1 causes arrest of cleavage and later development by disrupting cortical accumulation of actin and XAC ( 105 ) , suggesting that XAIP1 function together with XAC to regulate actin organization in V i V o . In chickens , an AIP1 ortholog , WDR1 , was identified as a gene that is upregulated in the auditory epithelium of the inner ear upon noise damage ( 131 ) . WDR1 is expressed in normal auditory epithelium and colocalized with ADF / cofilin and actin , but noise damage transiently induces overexpres - sion of WDR1 in the supporting cells that are important for the structural integrity of the epithelium ( 132 ) . This epithe - lium has the ability to regenerate the damaged tissues and restore hearing capability , suggesting that WDR1 is involved in cytoskeletal reorganization during regeneration . cDNAs for human and mouse WDR1 were cloned ( 131 ) , but no functional analysis of these proteins has been reported . 5 . 5 . Plants . In the green plant Arabidopsis thaliana , two AIP1 genes are identified ( 133 ) . Interestingly , AtAIP1 - 1 is F IGURE 4 : Disorganization of actin filaments by a null mutation of the C . elegans AIP1 ( unc - 78 ) gene . Wild - type ( A ) or unc - 78 - null ( B ) worms were stained with tetramethylrhodamine phalloidin to visualize filamentous actin , and parts of the body wall muscle are shown . Striated organization of actin filaments in the wild type ( A ) is significantly disturbed in the unc - 78 mutant with formation of extensive aggregates ( B ) . The bar is 20 (cid:237) m . Current Topics Biochemistry , Vol . 42 , No . 46 , 2003 13367 specifically expressed in reproductive tissues , whereas AtAIP1 - 2 is in both reproductive and vegetative tissues . An antibody against AtAIP1 - 1 is cross - reactive with a lily protein that is localized to actin bundles in pollen grains and diffuse cytoplasm in pollen tubes ( 133 ) . This pattern is very similar to that of LIADF1 , a pollen - specific ADF / cofilin in lily , suggesting collaboration of AIP1 and ADF / cofilin in actin reorganization in pollens . 6 . Conclusion and Future Directions Functional studies in different model systems agree that ADF / cofilin and AIP1 collaborate to enhance actin filament disassembly and participate in cytoskeletal reorganization . ADF / cofilin has been studied in a variety of systems , but studies on AIP1 are still limited . Therefore , it is not known whether AIP1 is generally involved in a number of cellular events that are regulated by ADF / cofilin . For example , ADF / cofilin promotes filament severing during lamellipodial extension and enhances cell motility . AIP1 is also localized at the leading edge of motile Dictyostelium amoeboid cells , and AIP1 - null cells show impaired cell motility ( 125 ) . However , how AIP1 regulates cell motility is not known . For efficient protrusion of lamellipodia , capping protein is recruited to the leading edge , blocks most barbed ends , and contributes to maintaining high concentrations of monomeric actin ( 134 , 135 ) . AIP1 may function as a barbed end capping protein specific for ADF / cofilin - severed filaments . Therefore , when AIP1 is absent , inefficient capping will allow excessive filament elongation and consumption of actin monomers , thus impairing efficient protrusion of lamellipodia . ADF / cofilin and capping protein are also identified as essential compo - nents of an in V itro model of actin - based motility ( 136 ) . Therefore , it would be interesting to test whether AIP1 can substitute for capping protein in this system . Recent advances in the structure and function of the AIP1 proteins should greatly help further the understanding of the mechanism of cytoskeletal regulation by ADF / cofilin and AIP1 . First of all , the structure should help in identifying functional surface residues on AIP1 , which will be essential in modeling the structure of the complex of actin , ADF / cofilin , and AIP1 . However , binding of AIP1 to actin or ADF / cofilin has been demonstrated only by immunoelectron microscopy or crude systems ( yeast two - hybrid interactions and affinity chromatography of cell lysates ) . Therefore , the interaction of AIP1 with actin and ADF / cofilin is not fully understood . Evidence of binding of AIP1 to the side of actin filaments is presented ( 110 ) , but its functional significance is not known . Also , AIP1 enhances actin depolymerization in the presence of ADF / cofilin , but it is not known whether AIP1 affects the off rate of actin subunits at the pointed ends . In conclusion , AIP1 is a conserved helper for ADF / cofilin in enhancing filament fragmentation and promoting reorga - nization of the filaments . Even though AIP1 is not a central player in actin filament dynamics , it may be required for fine - tuning of the ADF / cofilin - mediated actin dynamics in the highly complex in V i V o cytoskeletal systems .
