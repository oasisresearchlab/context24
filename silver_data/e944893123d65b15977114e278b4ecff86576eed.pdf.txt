The reasons for gender disparity in disease severity is unclear and can be due to host factors . To determine whether males have delayed viral clearance after infection , we evaluated the time to clearance in symptomatic patients tested by serial oropharyngeal / nasopharyngeal swabs followed by RT - PCR at a reference lab in Mumbai , India . A total of 68 subjects with median age of 37 years ( 3 - 75 range ) were examined and included 48 ( 71 % ) males and 20 ( 29 % ) females . We observed that females were able to achieve viral clearance significantly earlier than males , with a median difference of 2 days in achieving a negative PCR result ( P value = 0 . 038 ) . Furthermore , examination of 3 families with both male and female patients followed serially , demonstrated that female members of the same household cleared the SARS - CoV2 infection earlier in each family . To determine reasons for delayed clearance in males , we examined the expression patterns of the SARS - CoV2 receptor , Angiotensin - converting enzyme 2 ( ACE2 ) , in tissue specific repositories . We observed that the testes was one of the highest sites of ACE2 expression in 3 independent RNA expression databases ( Human Protein Atlas , FAMTOM5 and GETx ) . ACE2 was also determined to be highly expressed in testicular cells at the protein levels . Interestingly , very little expression of ACE2 was seen in ovarian tissue . Taken together , these observations demonstrate for the first time that male subjects have delayed viral clearance of SARS - CoV2 . High expression of ACE2 in testes raises the possibility that testicular viral reservoirs may play a role in viral persistence in males and should be further investigated . Introduction : The novel coronavirus SARS - CoV2 , the causative infectious agent of the COVID19 pandemic , represents a significant risk to global health , health care infrastructure , the global financial markets , and social stability . As coronaviruses rarely transfer from their zoonotic species to humans and cause serious disease , there remain many questions related to how these viruses interact with their human host to propagate infection which is causative of the resultant morbidity and mortality . Multiple early studies have demonstrated a gender imbalance in disease severity and duration , with both the incidence of disease and morbidity in men being more than double that of women . 1 , 2 This is similar to prior data regarding disease severity with the SARS - CoV1 outbreak in the early 2000s and the MERS epidemic . 3 , 4 While some of these effects have been attributed All rights reserved .

The first positive case for SARS - CoV 2 was detected in Mumbai on March 11th 2020 . Patients with suspected symptoms were admitted to the isolation ward at the Kasturba Hospital & monitored . Nasopharyngeal / orophryngeal swabs collected at the time of diagnosis were analyzed by RT - PCR for positivity / negativity per the Berlin protocol . 8 Subsequent swabs were collected at approximately 48 hours intervals until the swab test was documented to be negative . Persons residing in the same household as the index case as well as contacts were also tested . A log rank test was used to compare the difference in viral clearance between males and females and is represented in Figure 1 . B using Kaplan - Meier curves . Mean & median times towards viral clearance were also calculated for each gender . Statistical calculations and analysis were performed in the R version 3 . 6 . 1 environment . Three RNA and protein expression datasets ( Human Protein Atlas , FAMTOM5 and GETx ) were subsequently queried to quantify the expression of the Angiotensin - converting enzyme 2 ( ACE2 ) which is the receptor for SAR - CoV2 entry into human tissue . mRNA as well as protein expression was queried in each organ . Results and Discussion : Delayed clearance of SARS - CoV2 is seen in males : To test whether males have delayed clearance , we examined patterns in patients that were symptomatic and tested positive for SARS - CoV2 by swabs followed by RT - PCR at the Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory at the Kasturba Hospital for Infectious Diseases in Mumbai , India . A total of 68 subjects with median age of 37 years ( 3 - 75 range ) were examined . The subjects included 48 ( 71 % ) males and 20 ( 29 % ) females ( Fig 1A ) . SARS - CoV2 clearance was determined by the number of days it took to achieve a persistently negative test by RT - PCR . The procedure involved was that serial oropharyngeal / nasopharyngeal swabbing till negative results were obtained . We observed that females were able to achieve viral clearance significantly earlier than males ( Fig 1B , Log Rank All rights reserved .

Female subjects achieved viral clearance at a median of 4 days ( range 1 - 10 days ) vs a median of 6 days ( range 1 - 15 days ) in male subjects ( Fig 1A , B ) . As the population was composed of heterogeneous subjects , we next identified 3 families ( with all family members residing in the same household ) with a recent positive swab for SARS - CoV2 . In all 3 families , the female members cleared the SARS - COV2 infection earlier than the male members of the same family ( Fig 1C ) . These data show for the first time that males clear the virus later than females . Testes express high levels of ACE2 receptor : SARS - CoV2 enters cells via a complex , multiple - step process which begins with interaction of the viral surface spike protein with ACE2 . 9 , 10 ACE2 is a plasma membrane bound monocarboxypeptidase that converts angiotensin II to angiotensin 1 - 7 ( Ang 1 - 7 ) , which antagonizes the hypertensive effects of Angiotensin I via stimulation of the MAS receptor . 11 We evaluated ACE2 expression at the mRNA and protein levels using tissue specific databases . We observed that ACE2 is expressed at high levels in the lungs , GI tract , myocardium , testes , and brush border cells of the renal proximal tubule at the mRNA levels ( Fig 2A ) . Interestingly , the testes was one of the sites with highest ACE2 expression in 3 independent RNA expression databases ( Human Protein Atlas , FAMTOM5 and GETx ) ( Fig 2B ) , consistent with prior reports . 12 - 14 ACE2 was also determined to be highly expressed in testicular cells at the protein levels ( Fig 2D , E ) . Interestingly , very little expression was seen in ovarian tissue ( Fig 2C , F ) . These data raise the possibility that SARS - CoV2 may bind to testicular ACE2 and the testes may serve as a male specific viral reservoir . Consistent with this hypothesis , a very recent study demonstrated testicular gonadal loss - of - function in SARS - CoV2 patients , suggesting possible damage to testicular cells during infection . 15 Taken together , these observations demonstrate that male subjects have delayed viral clearance . High expression of ACE2 RNA and protein in testes leads to the hypothesis that testicular viral reservoirs may exist and play a role in viral persistence , and should be further investigated by larger clinical studies . This hypothesis may have important implications for understanding the transmission and persistence of SARS - CoV2 virus in humans , and in a gender - specific manner . All rights reserved .
