It can self - assemble actively into dynamical structures that govern the mechanical properties of the cell , its motility and its division . However , only very few studies characterize the kinetics of the active actin self - assembly process beyond the formation of an entangled network . Here , we follow actin polymerization kinetics and organization into entangled networks using time resolved passive microrheology . We establish a relationship between the initial concentration of monomers , the active polymerization and network formation kinetics , and the viscoelastic properties from the onset of actin polymerization upto the formation of a steady state entangled network . Surprisingly , we ﬁnd that at high enough initial monomer concentrations the elastic modulus of the forming actin networks overshoots and then relaxes with a - 2 / 5 power law , that we attribute to rearrangements of the network into a steady state structure . 2 PACS numbers : INTRODUCTION The mechanisms governing self - organization processes have long been a subject of interest for a large community of physicists , chemists and engineers . Of special interest are biological systems , as the cell cytoskeleton , that self - assemble and organize while consuming chemical energy . These systems self - organize continuously with little errors on many length scales , and in highly noisy conditions . The most noted example being the coding and transcription of genetic information [ 1 ] . The actin cytoskeleton plays a major role in maintaining the cell shape and mechanical properties [ 2 – 4 ] . Actin ﬁlaments are also the substrate for the action of the myosin motor protein and together they take a prominent role in many active cellular processes such as cell motility and cell division [ 5 , 6 ] . In order to characterize the kinetics of the self - assembly of actin monomers into actin ﬁlaments and their organization into actin networks , it is necessary to observe both the nucleation and growth of actin polymer chains as well as the network formation process . Previous experiments investigated actin polymerization kinetics by using in - vitro model systems , in order to isolate the relevant variables of the network formation process [ 7 – 9 ] . So far , little is known about the dynamics of this process due to the sub - diﬀraction - limit size of the actin ﬁlaments at the initial stages , and the diﬃculty to visually examine this process in real time at intermediate and ﬁnal stages in bulk solution . The kinetics of actin networks formation was mostly investigated by pyrene assay [ 10 – 12 ] , which is based on the enhanced ﬂuorescence of pyrene - conjugated actin that occurs during polymerization . When pyrene with monomeric G - actin forms pyrene F - actin , the intensity of ﬂuorescence increases until it saturates to a ﬁnal value when the polymerization process ends . Therefore , this method alone does not give information about the structural and mechanical properties of the forming network , and does not insure that a network has been formed . In order to overcome the sub - diﬀraction limit , super resolution imaging of actin was preformed [ 13 – 15 ] on dilute suspensions , low density networks and in the cortex of cells [ 16 , 17 ] . Super resolution methods are direct and reliable but cannot resolve the evolution of actin networks , which dynamically changes their properties in time scales of milliseconds . Here , we characterize the kinetics of self - organization of actin networks at time scales 3 unattainable previously . We do so by starting at diﬀerent monomeric actin concentrations , using time resolved microrheology . Using tracer particles that are larger than the ﬁnal mesh size of the formed networks , allows us to follow through the formation and relaxation of the self - organized network until it reaches a steady state . We note that microrheology of actin networks with and without myosin motors was studied extensively [ 18 – 22 ] . However , it was not used previously to obtain the details of polymerization kinetics and network rearrangement . MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials G - actin was puriﬁed from rabbit skeletal muscle acetone powder [ 23 ] , with a gel ﬁltration step , stored on ice in G - buﬀer ( 5 mM Tris HCl , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 1 mM DTT , 0 . 01 % NaN 3 , pH 7 . 8 ) and used within two weeks . G - actin concentration was determined by absorbance , using a UV / Visible spectrophotometer ( Ultraspec 2100 pro , Pharmacia ) in a cuvette with a 1 cm path length and extinction coeﬃcient of ǫ 290 = 26 , 460 M − 1 cm − 1 . Polystyrene colloids with diameter of 1 . 5 µm ( Polysciences , Catalog No . 09719 - 10 ) were incubated for 2hr before the experiment began with a 10 mg / ml bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) solution ( Sigma ) to prevent nonspeciﬁc binding of protein to the bead surface [ 24 ] . Actin polymerization was initiated by adding G - actin at various concentrations to F - buﬀer solution ( 5 mM Tris HCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 05 M KCl , 200 µ M EGTA , 1 mM ATP ) and gently mixing . The colloidal particles were added before mixing . The initial actin monomer concentration varied between C A = 2 − 24 µM , corresponding to a mesh size range of ξ = 0 . 95 − 0 . 25 µm , respectively [ 25 ] . Sample preparation Samples were prepared on glass coverslips ( 40mm in diameter ) coated with methoxy - terminated PEG ( Polyethylene glycol , Mw = 5000 g / mol , Nanocs ) for 2hr before the exper - iment began to prevent F - actin ﬁlaments from sticking to the glass surface . The sample chamber was ∼ 150 µm high and sealed with paraﬃn wax . Actin polymerization was car - ried out by mixing the monomers , buﬀer , and the ﬂuorescent tracer particles together . The 4 sample holder was initially positioned on the microscope . Immediately after mixing , the sus - pensions were placed on the sample holder and the sample was sealed . This ensured minimal drifts in the sample and enabled us to see the polymerization process from its onset . The lag time between mixing and recording was measured by a stop watch . In order to avoid wall eﬀects , imaging was done in the solution bulk approximately 60 µm away from the two glass coverslips . The resulting F - actin networks are well described as networks of semi - ﬂexible polymers , and their mesh size , ξ = 0 . 3 / √ c a [ 25 ] , was easily controlled by controlling the initial monomer concentration c a ( c a in mg / ml and ξ in µm ) . Fluorescence microscopy and imaging Imaging the motion of the tracer particles within the suspensions was done using an Olympus IX71 epi - ﬂuorescence microscope , at λ = 480nm with a 40x air objective . We recorded the motion of approximately 250 particles in the ﬁeld of view using a CMOS video camera ( Grasshoper 3 , Point Gray ) at a frame rate of 30Hz with an exposure time of 10ms . We used data from at least 10 5 frames per experiment and repeated each experiment three times . Particle tracking was done by conventional video microscopy , using the protocol of Crocker and Grier [ 26 ] implemented in MATLAB software . Time resolved microrheology The transient mechanical properties of the polymerizing actin solution were measured by one point microrheology ( 1P microrheology ) [ 27 – 29 ] using the following protocol . First we recorded movies of the mixed actin solution with the tracer particles as the actin polymerized . We then extracted the trajectories of the tracer particles throughout the movies . The movies were divided into sections of 30s . For each such a section we extracted the viscoelastic properties of the suspension , assuming it represents the average mechanical properties of the suspension in that time window . Namely , for all trajectories belonging to a given section we calculated the mean squared displacement ( MSD ) as a function of lag time , according to : h ∆ ~ r 2 ( τ ) i = h | ~ r ( t + τ ) − ~ r ( t ) | 2 i t , where ~ r is the particle position , τ is the lag time and t is the time since the beginning of the experiment . The averages were done both on t and on the ensemble of tracer particles per section . The shear modulus at time t 5 of the evolving network was calculated using the generalized , frequency - dependent form of the Stokes - Einstein relation . Speciﬁcally , the macroscopic Laplace - transformed complex shear modulus G ( s ) and the Laplace transform of the MSD h ∆˜ r 2 ( s ) i are related through [ 27 , 30 , 31 ] : ˜ G ( s ) = k B T πas h ∆˜ r 2 ( s ) i , ( 1 ) The storage and loss shear modulus are deﬁned as the real and imaginary part of the shear modulus ˜ G ( ω ) = G ′ ( ω ) + iG ′′ ( ω ) and can be obtained directly from G ( s ) [ 27 ] . Errors where estimated by the standard error of the mean . RESULTS FIG . 1 : Frequency dependence of the storage and loss modulus . ( a ) Illustration of the full range of behavior of an entangled semiﬂexible polymer system . ( b - e ) measurements of the shear moduli at the same frequency window . We note that in diﬀerent conditions , i . e . diﬀerent times and actin monomer concentrations , diﬀerent regions of ( a ) are accessible . Experimental conditions : ( b ) 3 µM actin after 2 . 5 min of polymerization , ( c ) 17 µM after 2 . 5 min of polymerization , ( d ) 17 µM actin after 3 . 5min of polymerization and ( e ) 3 µM after 60min of polymerization respectively ( b - e ) . Although the frequency is identical for all measurements , they exhibit diﬀerent regions of frequency in illustration ( a ) due to the reptation time increase ( see supplementary Table S2 ) . In order to capture in detail the whole process of self - assembly of the actin ﬁlaments and the self - organization of the actin networks , we tuned the initial concentration of actin monomers according to previous reports of pyrene based experiments [ 11 ] . Our primary 6 concern was to ensure that the polymerization and network formation process occur in timescales that are amenable for time resolved microrheology , i . e . , in the range of several to tens of minutes . For each monomer concentration , we record the movement of the tracer particles during the polymerization process . We then segmented the movie into sections of 30s and calculate the shear modulus as a function of frequency ( see Methods for details ) . Since we work with a given time window , we can access a given range of frequencies , 0 . 2 Hz < ω < 30 Hz . These frequencies reﬂect diﬀerent sections of the functional dependence of G ′ and G ′′ on frequency , depending on actin concentration and / or polymerization time ( e . g . , the time passed since the initiation of the polymerization ) . Fig . 1 illustrates G ′ ( ω ) and G ′′ ( ω ) at a full frequency range according to the tube theory of entangled polymer dynamics [ 32 – 35 ] with corresponding examples from our measurements . The transition between windows ( b - e ) in Fig . 1 is attributed to the reptation time increase ( † ESI , Table S2 ) [ 36 ] . A full time progression for the same actin monomer concentrations that are plotted in Fig . 1 ( b - e ) , is shown in the † ESI , Fig . S4 . The storage and loss moduli in Fig . 1 ( e ) exhibit a scaling of 3 / 4 corresponds to theory [ 37 ] . We note here , that the calculated complex shear modulus is only an estimation of the actual shear modulus , since we are far from thermal equilibrium and since the tracer particle is not big enough compared to the mesh size to provide the true bulk response throughout the experiment [ 38 ] . None - the - less , for the purpose of following the kinetics of the process , it is the change in the shear modulus that is important and not its absolute value . We characterize the temporal evolution of self - organizing actin networks by recording the values of G ′ and G ” at ω 0 = 0 . 25 Hz Hz ( or τ = 4 s ) for each time segment since the initiation of polymerization . This is repeated for diﬀerent values of the initial concentration of actin . Ideally , we would characterize the viscoelastic properties of the networks in a well deﬁned region such as the elastic plateau , namely at ω − > 0 . However , this region is not attainable in our experiments . We therefore compromise on a value that allows collection of a suﬃcient amount of data while at the lowest possible frequency . The values of the shear modulus obtained thus for each segment of the movie are then plotted as a function of time since polymerization initiated ( Fig . 2 ) . For all actin concentrations , we observe that at the beginning of polymerization , G ′ is lower than G ′′ for all measurable frequencies ω ( including at ω 0 ) , indicating that the actin suspension behaves as a viscous ﬂuid . Later , ﬁlaments start to elongate and overlap and we observe a viscoelastic behavior at the lower frequencies . After entanglement of ﬁlaments has occurred , G ′ is higher than 7 G ′′ at low frequencies and lower at high frequencies ( as seen in Fig . 2 ( b , c ) ) . At high actin concentrations , we reach a range in which the actin network is fully formed indicated by the fact that G ′ is higher than G ′′ at all frequencies FIG . 2 : A typical plot of the process of 3 µM actin network polymerization as observed from the change of the elastic and loss shear modulus at ω 0 for entanglement time determination ( a ) , and the corresponding G ( ω ) graphs at the beginning ( b ) and at the end ( c ) of network’s formation . The kinetics of the polymerization and self - organization of the actin network can be ex - tracted from the functional dependence of the shear moduli on the time since polymerization initiated Fig . 2 ( a ) , where we deﬁne the time for the onset of entanglements t onset to be the time in which G ′ ( ω 0 ) becomes larger than G ′′ ( ω 0 ) ( see dashed line in Fig . 2 ( a ) ) . We also deﬁne the averaged shear moduli of the ﬁnal network as its average value at long times ( Fig . 2 ( a ) ) . The total duration of the polymerization and organization of the actin network is the time in which G ′ and G ′′ reach their steady state value . Using a range of initial actin monomer concentrations , we are able to study the kinetics of self - organization at diﬀerent conditions and for networks with diﬀerent mesh sizes , as shown in Fig . 3 . As seen in Fig . 3 , at very short times and mostly at low concentrations of actin we observe a time delay before the suspension starts to increase it’s viscosity . We attribute this lag to the lower probability of nucleation . An abrupt increase in the shear modulus is observed after a few minutes , depending on actin concentration . In this stage the suspension still behaves 8 FIG . 3 : The temporal evolution of G ′ and G ′′ at ω 0 for actin monomer concentrations varying from 2 to 24 µM . The shear moduli of C A = 7 − 24 µM exhibit overshoot after network entanglement . A short lag phase observed at the beginning of polymerization for C A = 2 − 7 µM . as a viscous ﬂuid with increasing viscosity , probably reﬂecting the growth of actin ﬁlaments . When the length of the ﬁlaments reaches a critical value , the system becomes an entangled network and proceeds to stabilize until reaching a steady state . In actin concentrations which are greater than 4 µM , a strong overshoot of the networks’ storage modulus occurs at the later stages of ﬁlament elongation and then relaxes to the steady state value . Interestingly , the relaxation curves of all samples which exhibited an overshoot collapse into a master curve when normalized by the initial actin monomer concentration [ 39 ] with a relaxation power law of - 2 / 5 , as shown in Fig . 4 . We assume that this eﬀect is related to rearrangements of the ﬁlaments within the network , since we eliminated the possibility that it is caused by a lack of ATP ( see † ESI Fig . S1 ) . All curves were taken from G’ values that exhibit a frequency dependency corresponds to Fig . 1 ( d , e ) . For each curve in Fig . 3 , the entanglement time and the averaged shear modulus of the ﬁnal network were extracted ( see Fig . 5 ) . We ﬁnd that the lower the monomer concentration is , the longer it takes the solution to form a network . In addition , the ﬁnal stiﬀness of the networks increases with actin concentration ( Fig . 5 ( b ) ) , as expected ( consistent with G ′ ∼ c A ) [ 39 ] . 9 FIG . 4 : G ′ Relaxation regions fall on a master curve once G ′ is normalized by actin monomer concentration and presented as a function of time . FIG . 5 : Eﬀect of actin concentration on the entanglement time ( a ) , and the averaged stiﬀness of the network at long experiment times ( b ) . The dashed lines represent a ﬁt to a linear dependence between the shear moduli and C A In order to estimate the ﬁlament length during polymerization , we refer to the theory of diﬀusion of dilute suspension of rigid rods [ 40 ] . This is justiﬁed since the actin ﬁlaments have a long persistence length of l p ∼ 17 µm [ 41 , 42 ] . The averaged ﬁlament length L is thus given by [ 40 ] : L ∼ D r η eﬀ / η 0 − 1 A , ( 2 ) where A = 4 3 1 ln ( 1 / φ ) ( 1 − ln ( ln ( 1 / φ ) ln ( 1 / φ ) + 0 . 6634 ln ( 1 / φ ) ) , D is the ﬁlament width , η eﬀ and η 0 are the viscosity 10 of the solution and the solvent respectively and φ is the volume fraction of polymerized actin monomers . It is important to note that this calculation is valid before entanglement occurs only ( i . e . until t onset ) . After the onset of entanglements , the suspension can not be treated as a viscous ﬂuid . FIG . 6 : Average ﬁlament length ( L ) as a function of time extracted from Eq . 2 for monomer concentrations varying from 2 to 24 µM . t onset denotes the time in which entanglement starts , e . g . when the dilute diﬀusing rod suspension limit is no longer valid . The ﬁnal average length of ﬁlaments decreases with an increase in actin monomer concentration . We ﬁnd that the lower the monomer concentration is , the longer the forming ﬁlaments are . When the concentration is low , fewer nucleation sites are being formed and the ﬁla - ments can use the free monomers to elongate more . This is due to the fact that the rate determining step for actin polymerization at these concentration is the nucleation . When the initial concentration of actin monomers increases , there are more nucleation sites , which reduces the amount of available monomers per growing ﬁlament . It is important to note that the calculated lengths reﬂect the relative length in the diﬀerent networks and not the actual values . This is because they were extracted from a shear modulus obtained by 1P microrheology ( which does not reﬂect the bulk’s viscosity ) . In fact , we expect the actual shear modulus to be higher than measured here , indicating that the actual ﬁlament length is longer ( see comparison to 2P microrheology in supporting information ( Fig . S2 ) and 11 previous reports [ 43 – 45 ] ) . This is especially true at low actin concentrations where the ratio between the mesh size and the diameter of the tracer particles is small [ 38 ] . The initial elongation rate , L rate was calculated for each actin concentration at the be - ginning of the polymerization process in order to derive estimation for the rate law . The dependence of L rate on the initial actin monomer concentration is shown in Fig . 7 . We FIG . 7 : The initial elongation rate L rate extracted from Fig . 6 as a function of actin monomer concentration with ﬁtted power laws of L rate ∝ [ actin ] 3 and L rate ∝ [ actin ] respectively . observe two distinct regimes , for low actin concentrations L rate ∝ [ actin ] 3 and for higher concentrations L rate ∝ [ actin ] . This is consistent with a nucleation limited growth at low concentrations and diﬀusion limited growth at higher concentrations . The L rate ∝ [ actin ] 3 power law obtained here might indicate that the nucleus is built of three monomers , which is consistent with previous results that estimate the size of the nucleus to be two to four monomer units [ 11 ] . For high actin concentrations , the reaction rate grows linearly with the concentration as expected , since the elongation rate depends on the collisions rate [ 17 , 46 , 47 ] . Consistent results were obtained from the 2P microrheology analysis ( see † ESI Fig . S3 ) . By knowing the mechanical properties of the forming network at each time point , the entanglement length l e can be estimated according to [ 44 , 48 ] : τ e = 1 ω e ∼ = η 0 ℓ 4 e k B T l p , ( 3 ) where τ e and ω e are the entanglement time and frequency respectively . We note that we deﬁne ω e as the crossover frequency in which G ′′ becomes larger than G ′ ( Fig . 1e ) . This choice is slightly diﬀerent than the actual deﬁnition of ω e , but is easier to extract in a consistent manner from our experiments . We extracted ω e only for the samples in which this crossover was observed , namely for low initial actin monomer concentrations . The evolution of ℓ e with 12 time for these concentrations is presented in Fig . 8 . As expected the entanglement length , FIG . 8 : The entanglement length ( ℓ e ) as a function of time for samples with low actin monomer concentration . ℓ e decreases by increasing actin monomer concentration . ℓ e , decreases with time as the ﬁlaments grow and the mesh size decreases . Furthermore , we ﬁnd that the entanglement length decreases upon increasing monomer concentration , as the ﬁlament density increases and the mesh size decreases [ 25 ] . CONCLUSIONS In this paper we have presented a new , indirect way of characterizing the kinetics of entangled F - actin networks formation . By using time resolved 1P microrheology , we obtained the evolution of the mechanical properties of a forming network with time resolution of 30s , for initial actin monomer concentrations varying from 2 to 24 µM . We found that the kinetics of the self - organization process is governed by nucleation at low actin monomer concentrations , with an indication that the stable nucleus is made of three monomers . This result is in accord with previous reports [ 11 ] . At higher monomer concentrations , we found that the kinetics of self - organization is limited by diﬀusion corresponding to a pseudo - ﬁrst order process suggested in earlier reports [ 46 , 47 ] . We assume that in these higher actin monomer concentrations nucleation occurs rapidly . Our characterization technique enabled a unique measurement of the self organization kinetics past the formation of ﬁlaments , providing insight into how networks reorganize into an equilibrium structure once the initial polymerization is ﬁnished . Interestingly , we ﬁnd that the shear modulus overshoots its ﬁnal value at concentrations where polymerization is rapid . More striking , is the universal power law of - 2 / 5 we ﬁnd for the relaxation of the stor - 13 age modulus to the equilibrium value . We assume the relaxation is related to actin ﬁlaments rearrangements , however , complementary experiments using cryo - electron microscopy might shed light on this relaxation process . These experiments set up the stage for studying the polymerization kinetics of actin networks of diﬀerent structures , such as the branched network structure obtained in the presence of the arp2 / 3 protein . Experiments studying the eﬀect of the presence of myosin motors on actin polymerization kinetics using the same methodology are presently under - way . Our simpliﬁed in - vitro approach furthers the understanding of how underling physical principles contribute to the cytoskeleton active self - organization process .
