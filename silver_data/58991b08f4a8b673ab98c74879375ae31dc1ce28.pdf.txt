Various tools can be used to support B2B brands , including the internet and other interactive technologies . Yet research on how organizations use Social Networking Sites ( SNS ) to achieve brand objectives remains limited . This study addresses the gap by focusing on B2B SMEs and their social networking practices , particularly , usage , perceived barriers , and the measurement of effectiveness of SNS as a marketing tool . Findings from a mail survey show that over a quarter of B2B SMEs in the UK are currently using SNS to achieve brand objectives , the most popular of which is to attract new customers . On the other hand , the most significant barrier is the lack of perceived relevance for particular sectors . Notably , the overwhelming majority of users do not adopt any metrics to assess SNS effectiveness . Almost half of the sample of SMEs that currently use SNS have indicated their intention to increase their marketing spending on this channel , highlighting the growing importance of SNS in a B2B context . Keywords : Social Media , Social Networking Sites , B2B brands , SMEs 5 1 . Introduction The advent of Web 2 . 0 has created new ways to communicate , collaborate and share content ( Enders , Hungenberg , Denker , & Mauch 2008 ) . Statistics from NielsenWire ( 2010 ) show that in 2009 , social media and specifically , social networking sites ( SNS ) such as such as Facebook , Twitter , MySpace and LinkedIn , were a popular online activity in terms of average time spent . Currently , there are more than 150 SNS ; in 2009 , Facebook was ranked first in terms of popularity , with 206 . 9 million unique visitors globally ( NielsenWire 2010 ) . Social media , also known as ‘user - generated communication’ , now represents a prevalent source of information ; it has changed the tools and strategies companies use to communicate , highlighting that information control now lies with the customer ( Mangold & Faulds 2009 ) . A study by Cone ( 2008 ) ( http : / / www . coneinc . com / ) shows that 93 % of social media users believe that companies should have a social media presence , while 85 % of them think that companies should interact with customers via SNS . Companies have now penetrated the online social networking scene , offering direct links from their corporate websites to Facebook and Twitter , and use these tools to promote brands and support the creation of brand communities ( Kaplan & Haenlein 2010 ) . Recent statistics show that advertising spending on Facebook and MySpace is expected to reach $ 605m and $ 435m respectively for 2010 , whilst a significant portion of this spending will go towards building and maintaining a social network presence ( Williamson 2009 ) . Despite the popularity of SNS , their importance in shaping commercial online interaction ( Mislove et al . 2007 ) and their potential to support brands ( Christodoulides 2009 ) , research into SNS is very limited , and focuses largely on the consumer in a B2C domain . To date , there is paucity of systematic research on how SNS are used by companies , particularly B2B 6 companies , and how they contribute to brand objectives . Anecdotal evidence ( e . g . Shih 2009 ) suggests that social media is important for B2B companies . B2B companies can use social media and specifically SNS such as Facebook and LinkedIn to communicate with their customers and suppliers , build relationships and trust , as well as to identify prospective partners in terms of B2B selling ( Shih 2009 ) . It is notable that while B2B e - commerce is valued at more than three and half times that of B2C e - commerce ( Kalapesi , Willesdof & Zwillenberg 2010 ) the interest in , and subsequent adoption of , social media by B2B organizations has been slow compared to their B2C counterparts . This lack of research into SNS in a B2B environment provides the impetus for our studywhich addresses this gap , and contributes to existing literature in the following ways . First , it examines how B2B SMEs use SNS . Our decision to focus on small and medium sized companies within a B2B context is because they represent the majority of industrial businesses , and are a significant driver of economic growth ( LaPlaca 2011 ) . Second , the study provides insights into the extent of use and the reasons why B2B SMEs use SNS , as well as insights into the perceived barriers that inhibit usage . Third , it examines differences between organizations from different industries in terms of their usage of SNS . Fourth , the study explores the measurement practices used by companies who engage in brand activities on SNS . Despite calls from both industry and academia for new and creative metrics to suit the social media environment ( Russell 2009 ) , very little is known as to the metrics actually used by B2B organizations to assess their branding efforts on SNS . Fifth , it investigates whether there are differences between users and non - users of SNS , based on their organizational innovativeness levels . 7 The paper opens by reviewing the literature on B2B branding and social media . It then discusses the methodology and main findings of a postal survey administered to a sample of B2B SMEs in the UK . The findings are discussed in the light of the previous literature highlighting implications for practitioners and suggestions are made for further research . 2 . Background 2 . 1 B2B Branding and the Internet Previous research has established the importance of branding for B2B firms ( e . g . Mudambi 2002 ; Lynch & de Chernatony 2004 ; Leek & Christodoulides 2010 ; Lindgreen , Beverland & Farrelly 2010 ) . In an age characterized by increasing commoditization ( van Riel et al . 2005 ) , branding allows B2B organizations to differentiate by creating a unique and consistent identity ( Mitchell , King & Reast 2001 ) . A strong B2B brand results in enhanced quality perceptions in the market ( Cretu & Brodie 2007 ) and allows organizations to transfer brand equity in other categories through extensions ( Hutton 1997 ) . It raises the barriers to entry for competitive brands and leads to higher demand and / or allows companies to command a premium price ( Mitchell et al . 2001 ; Low & Bois 2002 ; Ohnnemus 2009 ) . In competitive bidding situations , which are often the norm in industrial markets , a branded product may help achieve consensus in the decision making unit , and influence the decision in favor of the owning brand ( Wise & Zendnickova 2009 ) . In the distribution channel , a strong B2B brand increases the company’s negotiating power , and opens up opportunities for licensing ( Low & Bois , 2002 ; Ohnemus 2009 ) . Finally , a strong B2B brand is more likely to enjoy higher loyalty ( McQuiston 2004 ) and more referrals from buyers ( Bendixen , Bukasa & Abratt 2004 ) . 8 Following the advent of the internet , business marketing companies have started to appreciate this tool as a value - adding channel that enables companies to provide information , to accommodate connectivity , community and transactions , and to share cost reductions ( Sharma 2002 ) . According to Pitt et al . ( 2006 : 600 ) “…the internet is becoming the most important vehicle for global business - to - business commerce” . B2B marketers thus use the internet to generate value for their brands through information , knowledge , conversations , relationships and e - commerce ( Sharma 2002 ) . Along similar lines to Sharma ( 2002 ) , Walters ( 2008 ) advocates three value - adding strategies when using the internet , namely information rich strategy , relational exchange , and joint learning strategy . Bauer , Grether and Leach ( 2002 ) focus solely on the significant role of the internet in building customer relationships in a B2B context . By examining the impact of specific internet characteristics ( e . g . interactivity and information availability ) on key relational variables ( e . g . trust , satisfaction and commitment ) the authors underline the suitability of the internet as a relationship marketing channel . 2 . 2 Social Networks , Social Media and SNS Social networks originate from sociology and , in a business context , refer to two or more connected business relationships , where an ‘exchange’ exists between business partners ( Anderson , Hakansson , & Johanson 1994 ; Pitt et al . 2006 ) . The notion of a ‘network’ is based on the establishment of ties between individuals , groups of people , organizational departments or corporations , that leads to the creation of social networks ( Wasserman & Faust 1994 ) . Social networks differ with respect to their size and heterogeneity ( Garton , Haythornthwaite & Wellman 1997 ) . Smaller , homogenous networks can be found in work groups ( Lea et al . 2006 ) , while larger , more heterogeneous networks are typically more complex and are associated with more diverse social characteristics . 9 In general , social networks are beneficial and valuable for the network participants in that they promote activities and the use of resources ( Gamunden , Ritter & Walter 1997 ) . Within a commercial context , social networks offer significant benefits , including the enhancement of economic value for organizations ( Stephen & Toubia , 2010 ) . A number of studies have used social networking theory to study the social networks of firms in B2B environments ( e . g . Björkman & Kock 1995 ) . Further , Pitt et al . ( 2006 ) and McCarthy et al . ( 2007 ) used social network theory to examine internet links between B2B firms . Social networks are important for the survival of small firms , and critical in competing with larger businesses ( Pitt et al . 2006 ; Copp & Ivy , 2001 ) . Technological progress and innovation have altered the nature of social networks . In particular , while traditional social networks have involved personal interactions of humans over time ( Kimball & Rheingold 2000 ) , interactions are now mediated by computers , which suggests a more impersonal form of communication . These computer - mediated networks or online social networks are more complex , and involve a greater degree of heterogeneity . Yet , the benefits associated with social networks are enhanced in an online environment , where the problems of time and geographical location become less significant . Members of an online network can exchange information and provide solutions from and to different locations across the world in a very short period of time ( Lea et al . 2006 ) . Given the importance of social networks and the internet ( e . g . Sharma 2002 ; Walters 2008 ) , which facilitate direct unmediated inter - organizational associations ( Berthon et al . 2003 ; Pitt et al . 2006 ) , it is argued that social media , and particularly SNS , can support brands , including B2B brands by developing and maintaining relationships between B2B firms . 10 According to Mangold and Faulds ( 2009 ) , social media consists of new sources of online information such as SNS , blogs , chat - rooms , rating websites , video and photo sharing websites and podcasts , created and used for educational purposes about issues including products and brands . In particular , SNS such as Facebook are some of the most popular and frequently visited web sites in the world ( alexa . com ) and , as such , marketers have intuitively recognized their potential in helping to achieve brand objectives ( van den Bulte & Wuyts 2007 ) . Social media are becoming more important as an internet marketing tool given their wide adoption by the general public . Evidence suggests that in consumer markets , SNS have become “de facto modus operandi” ( Mangold & Faulds 2009 : 359 ) for users to disseminate information about brands . However , research into social media , and specifically SNS , is still at an embryonic stage , and interest is focused mostly on a B2C context . In particular , previous academic research with regard to SNS has examined privacy and ethical issues , the prevalence of SNS among groups ( e . g . students , professionals ) , and the motivations for usage ( Dwyer , Hiltz & Passerini 2007 ; DiMicco et al . 2008 ; Pempek , Yermolayeva & Calvert 2009 ; Clark & Roberts , 2010 ) . Other research has examined how SNS generates word - of - mouth ( WOM ) in comparison with traditional marketing vehicles ( Trusov , Bucklin & Koen 2009 ) , how they generate revenue ( Enders et al . 2008 ) and how they can serve as shopping channels ( Cha 2009 ) . Despite the aforementioned benefits , B2B organizations seem to have realized SNS potential in supporting their brands later than B2C organizations . A time - line based on Google trends shows a growing interest in social media since 2004 , while specific interest in social media in B2B only emerged in 2010 . Place Figure 1 Here 11 Place Figure 2 Here 2 . 3 Benefits and Barriers of Social Media Anecdotal evidence from market research reports suggests that firms use social media , including SNS , inter alia , to build direct relationships with customers , increase traffic to their website , identify new business opportunities , create communities , distribute content , collect feedback from customers , and generally to support their brand ( Breslauer & Smith 2009 ; eMarketer 2010 ) . Indeed , due to their non - transactional nature , SNS are particularly suited for collecting information / feedback from customers , initiating two - way conversations with customers and developing relationships with customers through communication and interaction ( Enders et al . 2008 ; Kaplan & Haenlein 2010 ) . Additionally , one must consider that being a new technology , SNS may not be particularly attractive to B2B companies . Previous literature highlights barriers , both internal and external , to the adoption of new technologies by B2B organizations ( Buehrer , Senecal & Bolman Pullins 2005 ) . Indeed many organizations have been slow to adopt new technologies due to perceived barriers such as lack of money , time and training , negative views about usefulness , as well as unfamiliarity with the particular technology ( Buehrer et al . 2005 ; Venkatesh & Davis 2000 ) . Adoption of an innovation is therefore based on the perceptions of organizations regarding the particular technology , which ultimately determines the time of adoption ( Dillon & Morris 1996 ; Iacovou , Benbasat & Dexter 1995 ) . In addition , the adoption of technologies such as the internet also depends , inter alia , on the innovativeness of the specific organization as well as the personal innovativeness of the CEO ( Gauvin & Sinha 1993 ; Thong & Yap 1995 ; Agarwal & Prasad 1998 ; Premkumar & Roberts 12 1999 ; Mehrtens , Cragg & Mills 2001 ; Lu , Yao & Yu 2005 ) . Similarly , Frambach and Schillewaert ( 2002 ) , suggest that organizational innovativeness as well as firm size determine the adoption decision . Frambach and Schillewaert further suggest that smaller firms are more innovative , and are therefore expected to be more receptive to new technologies . On this basis , more innovative small and medium B2B companies are expected to be early adopters of SNS . 2 . 4 Social Media Metrics As with every marketing tool , SNS need to be evaluated for their effectiveness in achieving brand - related objectives . In an era characterized by increasing transparency and accountability ( McDonald & Mouncey 2009 ) and decreasing marketing budgets , the development of the right metrics is paramount for marketers , who are under immense pressure to show results for their spending . Traditional marketing metrics ( for a summary see Ambler 2003 ) are based on a linear form of communication , and do not suit the interactivity of Web 2 . 0 ( Hoffman & Novak 1996 ) . The literature suggests that the measurement of such networks pose significant problems for marketing managers , who need to evidence the results of their spending . The measurement problem is highlighted in existing studies , with Borders , Johnston and Rigdon ( 2001 ) suggesting that , “…existing business metrics were designed for a world of concrete boundaries and fixed categories – a world that is slipping away day by day… The same phenomenon will plague the business economy , as networks become more influential while remaining temporary and informal . On the other hand , perhaps this change will finally force researchers to develop metrics that are truly customer - centric , instead of relying on categories of business organizations as a convenient crutch . ” ( p . 204 ) . 13 3 . Method Data was collected from a sample of 1 , 000 UK B2B SMEs , randomly derived from the FAME 2 database via a mailed questionnaire . The questionnaire was sent to the marketing director or general director of each B2B SME , and a completion incentive was offered in the form of providing a summary of the study’s results . Companies targeted derived from various industrial sectors ( e . g . manufacturing , agriculture , etc . ) and varied in terms of employee numbers from 1 to 250 , with a turnover below 50 million Euros , in line the EU definition of small and medium enterprises ( European Commission 2003 ) . One hundred and forty - six questionnaires were returned with 102 being fully completed , representing a response rate of 15 % ( effective response rate 10 . 2 % ) . Ten companies were excluded from the sample as they did not conform to the definition of SMEs . The questionnaire consisted of four parts , and included measures based on the previous literature ( e . g . , Buehrer et al . 2005 ) , to capture the extent of usage of SNS by SMEs , barriers and benefits of usage , as well as questions about metrics used to evaluate the effectiveness of SNS in supporting brand objectives . Finally , three items were used to capture organizational innovativeness based on previous research ( Garcia - Morales , Llorens - Montes & Verdu - Jover 2006 ) . 4 . Analysis and Findings Initial statistics show that the average number of employees in SMEs in the sample was 66 , and the average sales turnover was between £1 and £10 million . Respondents had held their positions in the companies concerned for an average of 9 years . Table 1 shows the companies’ characteristics . 2 FAME is a business database which contains information on companies in the UK . Fame can be used to research individual companies and to search for and analyze companies with specific profiles ( e . g . SMEs ) . 14 Place Table 1 Here Analysis of the data was conducted to explore usage or non - usage of SNS , as well as to uncover the perceived benefits of using SNS and the perceived barriers . Chi - square tests were also conducted to identify any differences among B2B companies in terms of usage , based on industry , small / medium size , and sales turnover . The results are presented below and are organized by users / non - users of SNS . 4 . 1 SNS Users The findings indicate that 27 % of the B2B SMEs included in the sample used SNS . The majority of those SMEs used Facebook ( 77 % ) as a platform to meet their targets . The data shows that those using social networks had a presence on more than one site ( Table 2 ) . Fifty percent of the companies were either not investing any financial resources from their marketing budgets to SNS , or they were only using one percent of their budgets for this purpose . Place Table 2 Here In addition , none of the companies included in the sample planned to decrease their investments in SNS , whilst 44 % considered increasing the budget allocated to SNS . Table 3 summarizes the main reasons why companies use SNS . The majority of companies that use SNS were doing so to attract new customers ( 91 % ) , to cultivate relationships with their audience ( 86 % ) , to increase awareness of their brand ( 82 % ) or to communicate the brand 15 online ( 73 % ) . Receiving feedback ( 46 % ) and interacting with suppliers ( 14 % ) were found to be less popular reasons for using SNS . Place Table 3 Here Companies using SNS tend not to evaluate their effectiveness in supporting their brands ( 53 % ) . Respondents seem to mildly agree that their lack of knowledge with respect to possible metrics was one of the reasons why they failed to investigate SNS’ effectiveness ( M = 2 . 81 sd = 1 . 47 ) . Yet , more than half of them claimed that they are considering evaluating SNS effectiveness in the near future ( 61 % ) . The vast majority of those measuring SNS effectiveness were doing so predominantly based on the number of users joining their group ( 73 % ) . The number of comments ( irrespective of their nature ) also prevailed as an important metric to evaluate SNS effectiveness ( 55 % ) . Notably , friends’ requests were among the least popular indicators amongst managers of B2B SMEs ( 46 % were using friends’ requests ) . Table 4 presents the most significant measures of SNS effectiveness used by companies . Place Table 4 Here 4 . 2 SNS Non - Users On the other hand , 73 % of B2B SMEs indicated that they were not using SNS to support their brand strategies . The majority of respondents supported the view that SNS are not important for their industries ( 61 % ) , while 44 % were unsure as to whether or how SNS could help their brands . Unfamiliarity on the part of staff , limited staff technical skills and increased investment in terms of time , indicated that the participating firms lacked the necessary 16 experience , expertise and resources to adopt SNS . This makes SMEs less confident about using this channel to achieve marketing objectives . Finally , as in every competitive situation , competitors’ current practices and their decision not to use SNS also constituted a significant barrier to SNS adoption . Table 5 summarizes the main barriers perceived by the respondents . Place Table 5 Here Chi - square tests were also conducted to uncover any differences among the companies in terms of usage of SNS based on industry membership and employee numbers . Interestingly , no differences were observed between companies operating in the services and goods industries with respect to their usage of SNS ( χ 2 = 1 . 13 , p > . 005 ) . Similarly , no differences were found in terms of usage based on the SME’s sales turnover ( χ 2 = 2 . 13 , p > . 005 ) and between small and medium sized businesses ( χ 2 = . 68 , p > . 005 ) . Thus , results highlight thefact that SMEs’ use of SNS does not differ with respect to a specific B2B industry , small / medium size and sales turnover . Finally , a t - test was performed in order to investigate differences between users and non - users of SNS based on organizational innovativeness . Reliability for the innovativeness scale was acceptable ; α = . 83 . The results indicate significant differences in terms of organizational innovativeness between SNS users ( M = 2 . 46 , sd = 0 . 71 ) and non - users ( M = 3 . 1 , sd = 1 . 34 ) ; t ( 88 ) = 2 . 94 , p < . 005 ) . 17 5 . Discussion Our study contributes to the paucity of research on the usage , barriers and measurement of social media marketing by B2B SMEs . The findings from our postal survey indicate that over a quarter of B2B SMEs in the UK are currently using SNS to achieve their marketing objectives . This is an interesting finding given the fact that SNS have received no attention to date in the academic B2B literature . Also , none of the firms in the sample , plan to decrease their budgets with regard to SNS , while 44 percent of firms plan to increase their spending on SNS in the following year , suggesting an emerging “legitimacy” of social media as a marketing tool in a B2B context . B2B SMEs using SNS have recognized the importance of this tool to support marketing outcomes ( van den Bulte & Wuyts 2007 ) . In contrast to a B2C context , where awareness is the most prominent reason for adopting SNS ( eMarketer 2010 ) , awareness comes third in importance for B2B SMEs . Attracting new customers and cultivating customer relationships are considered to be the most important goals for such organizations when using SNS . This finding highlights the important role of relationship marketing in a B2B setting , and is aligned with past evidence suggesting that the internet and technology could be used as tools to build relationships ( Sharma 2002 ; Bauer et al . 2002 ) . In addition , considering that branding is a valuable differentiation strategy , not only for B2C but also B2B organizations ( Mitchell et al . 2001 ) , managers should strive to establish brand awareness as a first step towards making their brand stand out from that of the competition . Through SNS , B2B firms can capitalize on pre - existing business networks to achieve word of mouth and to make their brands better known . This justifies the increased importance of awareness as a reason for using SNS . To achieve a stronger competitive advantage , B2B SMEs indicate that SNS are important tools for communicating their brands online by capitalizing on SNS ' potential to 18 reach wide audiences . Along similar lines to the internet , B2B SMEs could also benefit from the use of SNS by their joint learning nature and the feedback provided through this channel ( e . g . Walters 2008 ; Sharma 2002 ) . Furthermore , the main reason for firms’ reluctance to use SNS is the nature of the industries these firms operate in , and the perceived irrelevance of SNS within that context . Although results indicate that usage patterns do not differ based on the industry SMEs operate in , relevance perceptions with respect to industries prevail as a significant external barrier to SNS usage . Consistent with the extant literature , where lack of training and management / technical support were established as significant barriers to using technology ( del Aguila - Obra & Padilla - Meléndez 2006 ; Buehrer et al . 2005 ) , our findings also highlight internal barriers such as lack of staff familiarity and technical skills as factors that prevent SMEs from using SNS to support their brands . This is also in line with Rogers ( 1983 ) , who argues that complexity is one of the five general attributes that influence adoption . In addition , our findings provide further support to the importance of cost ( in this case in terms of time ) as a barrier to SNS usage ( e . g . Buehrer et al . 2005 ; Tornatzky & Klein 1982 ) . Consistent with previous literature on the adoption of technologies ( e . g . , Mehrtens et al . 2001 ; Frambach & Schillewaert 2002 ) , the adoption of SNS by SMEs is also determined by the innovativeness of the specific organization . More innovative companies are more likely to use SNS , a finding which is probably linked to the early stages of interest for SNS in a B2B context ( see , for example Figures 1 & 2 ) . In addition , the findings of this study illustrate that SNS users fail to satisfy the need for more creative metrics ( Russell 2009 ) . Despite the increased pressure for marketing managers to 19 provide evidence of the effectiveness of their marketing activities , the vast majority of SNS users are not evaluating the effectiveness of their SNS in supporting their brands . Consequently , marketing managers are not able to provide quantified data that illustrate the importance of SNS , which might explain the reason why professionals remain skeptical about SNS as an effective marketing tool . Yet , the increased influence of social networks ( e . g . , customer reviews / feedback ) might force organizations to develop more customer - centered metrics to evaluate SNS effectiveness ( Borders et al . 2001 ) . In fact , the number of users joining the groups created by the B2B SMEs , and the discussions as well as the number of comments made , constitute the most popular measurement tools . This comes in agreement with the significant role of feedback as a driver towards SNS use ( Sharma 2002 ; Walters 2008 ) . The list of metrics used by B2B SMEs is in line with the extant literature that discusses possible effectiveness indicators ( e . g . Berkowitz 2009 in Sterne 2010 ) . Interestingly , although attracting new customers prevailed as the most important reason for using SNS , the importance of the number of customers attracted via SNS as a measurement tool is relatively low , coming only fourth amongst the most popular metrics . This finding illustrates that there is inconsistency between the goals of SNS use and the metrics used to assess whether or not these goals have been satisfied . Finally , despite evidence suggesting that firm size is positively related to the use of technology ( del Aguila - Obra & Padilla - Meléndez 2006 ; Premkumar & Roberts 1999 ) , findings from this study illustrate that the usage of SNS does not differ in terms of firm size . A possible explanation for the lack of a significant relationship between firm size and the usage of SNS is the cost effectiveness of SNS , and the relatively limited financial resources required for their adoption . Consequently , even small or medium sized B2B organizations could invest in SNS to embrace their brand objectives . The lack of a relationship between 20 size and usage could also be attributed to the focus of this study , which is on B2B SMEs ; differences might be observed when SMEs are compared with larger B2B organizations . 6 . Conclusion There is dearth of literature focusing on how B2B companies use SNS . This study contributes to knowledge by exploring the barriers , usage and perceived benefits of SNS among B2B SMEs in the UK , and reveals some interesting findings . Specifically , the study sheds light on the barriers with regard to the use of SNS which include the perceived irrelevance of SNS within the industry the company operates in , uncertainty as to the use of SNS to support brands , as well as barriers such as staff familiarity and lack of training . The finding highlights the varied managerial mindsets regarding the usage of SNS to support brands across B2B SMEs , irrespective of industry , and this has implications for the adoption of SNS and generally social media by B2B firms . In contrast to other technologies ( e . g . e - commerce ) , SNS do not require a large investment . However , their diffusion among B2B SMEs is ostensibly slow , with the majority of B2B SMEs in the UK being uncertain as to how SNS can be used to support their brands . Additionally , the study shows that over a quarter of B2B SMEs have recognized the importance of SNS in supporting brands ( van den Bulte & Wuyts 2007 ) and are therefore using SNS primarily to attract customers and to cultivate customer relationships . Additional perceived benefits stemming from the use of SNS include increasing awareness and communicating the brand online . This finding has implications for the use of SNS in customer relationship management . Following from evidence highlighting the important role of branding in a B2B setting , B2B firms can use SNS to create customer value in the form of interacting with customers , as well as building and fostering customer relationships . Being 21 closer to their customers will enable them to create a unique brand identity and to differentiate themselves from the competition . Customers can also benefit from the company in that through the use of SNS , they will be able to communicate with the company and provide feedback . 7 . Limitations and Future Research The study highlights the limited extent of metrics used by B2B SMEs to evaluate the effectiveness of SNS . However , it does not provide a full account of the reasons why B2B SMEs are not assessing SNS effectiveness . Future research should therefore focus on enhancing knowledge with respect to the reasons why the majority of SNS users are not assessing the effectiveness of their sites . In addition , evidence suggests that attitudes to technology affect adoption ( e . g . Ha and Stoel 2009 ) . However , this study did not provide insights into the attitudes of SMEs towards technology and , in particular , SNS . Future research should focus on establishing the link between attitudes towards technology and the intention to adopt or actual adoption behavior . Our study could also stimulate future research , focusing on the use of SNS by B2B customers . Our research highlights that the most prominent reason for the use of SNS by B2B SMEs is to attract new customers . Consequently , it would be useful to investigate whether SNS satisfy this objective by addressing this issue from the buyer’s point of view . Finally , this study could be replicated with a sample of large B2B companies to investigate whether adoption rates , usage , barriers and metrics strategies are the same as those relating to smaller B2B companies . 22 This study’s findings indicate that perceived SNS irrelevance within certain industries is an important barrier to SNS use . Considering that SNS may be more relevant to certain industries than others , future research might focus on adoption times , and might investigate the impact of industry type on how quickly B2B firms adopt SNS . For example , it is expected that IT B2B organizations will be early adopters , and therefore might have had an established presence in SNS for a relatively longer time than organizations operating in other industries ( e . g . office supplies ) . An investigation of the relationship between adoption time and reasons for adoption would also provide valuable insight into the factors that encourage organizations to be early adopters of SNS . 23 References Agarwal , R . & Prasad , J .
