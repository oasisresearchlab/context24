We investigated an outbreak due to Omicron variant in a restaurant . Besides the epidemiological and phylogenetic analysis , the secondary attack rates of customers of restaurant - related COVID - 19 before ( outbreak R1 ) and after enhancement of indoor air dilution ( outbreak R2 ) were compared . On 27 th December 2021 , an index case attended restaurant R2 for 98 minutes . Except for 1 sitting in the same table , six other secondary cases sat in 3 corners at 3 different zones , where designated staff served customers at different zones . The median exposure time was 34 minutes ( range : 19 - 98 minutes ) . All 7 secondary cases were phylogenetically related to the index . Smoke test demonstrated the airflow direction airflow which explained the distribution of secondary cases . Compared with an earlier COVID - 19 outbreak in another restaurant R1 ( 19 th February 2021 ) , just preceding the mandatory requirement of enhancement of indoor air dilution , the secondary attack rates among customers in R2 was significantly lower than that in R1 ( 3 . 4 % , 7 / 207vs 28 . 9 % , 22 / 76 , p < 0 . 001 ) . E nhancement of indoor air dilution including ventilation and installation of air purifier and upper - room ultraviolet - C germicidal irradiation could minimize the risk of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in the restaurant . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 3 1 . Introduction The Coronavirus Disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) , is the most devastating emerging infectious disease in the 21 st century . The cumulative number of infected cases had already exceeded 278 million with almost 5 . 4 million deaths as of 26 th December 2021 . 1 The case number further increased steeply after the report of Omicron ( B . 1 . 1 . 529 ) - SARS - CoV - 2 variant of concern . 2 Although the severity of disease caused by Omicron variant appeared to be decreased compared with the previously reported variants of concern , 3 probably due to the less efficient replication and virus - cell fusion than Delta variant as shown in transmembrane serine protease 2 - overexpressing VeroE6 cells , 4 The effective reproduction number of Omicron is 3 times greater than that of Delta under the same epidemiological conditons , 5 which may be related to the potential of better airborne transmissibility 6 , epidemic fatigue of the public and decreased compliance to control measures , and reduced neutralizing antibody against the Omicron variant in the vaccine recipients . 7 In Hong Kong , we adopted stringent measures on border control and required all inbound travelers arriving at the Hong Kong International Airport ( HKIA ) to undergo compulsory quarantine in the designated quarantine hotels for up to 21 days , except for the air crew who were allowed to be quarantined at home if the first COVID - 19 test was negative for SARS - CoV - 2 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) at the HKIA . With these measures , there was no community outbreak of COVID - 19 when the fourth wave of COVID - 19 came to the end on April 2021 . Despite some sporadic episodes of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in the designated quarantine hotels between quarantinees , 8 , 9 these did not result in a new wave of COVID - 19 in our community . 10 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 4 However , the risk of Omicron variant transmission remains substantial in Hong Kong because of the potential risk from quarantine exemption of air crew in the designated hotel . The risk of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission is even higher in the indoor areas , especially when the air crew members carrying Omicron variant visit eateries and bars where people take off their masks during drinking and dining . In March 2021 , the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government legislated on the requirement on air change or air purifier in the seating area of dine in catering premises to reduce the risk of indoor SARS - CoV - 2 transmission . 11 In brief , catering business operators require to attain an air change per hour ( ACH ) at 6 or above in the seating area . Otherwise air purifiers are to be installed as an alternative measure to reduce the risk of airborne transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 . 12 Here , our aim is to report a COVID - 19 outbreak due to Omicron variant in a restaurant with a relatively lower secondary attack rate possibly as a result of indoor air dilution enhancement by installation of ultraviolet - C air purifying system . 2 . Methods 2 . 1 Epidemiology of COVID - 19 in Hong Kong Since the official announcement of the outbreak of community acquired pneumonia in Wuhan , Hubei Province on 31 st December 2019 ( day 1 ) , 13 rapid and dynamic public health and infection control measures were implemented in the community and hospitals in response to the evolving epidemic to minimize the number of COVID - 19 infection . 14 - 18 Each COVID - 19 case , regardless of symptomatic or asymptomatic , was investigated for the potential source of acquisition . The epidemiological information found was uploaded to the website of the J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 5 Centre for Health Protection , Department of Health , the Government of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region , China . 19 2 . 2 Restaurant related COVID - 19 outbreaks before and after implementation of enhancement of air dilution in catering premises The epidemiology of COVID - 19 cases was analyzed , especially for those patients who had acquired the infection from the restaurants during the evolving COVID - 19 pandemic in Hong Kong . Outbreak investigation was specifically conducted to understand the risk of acquisition of Omicron variant in the restaurant ( Outbreak R2 ) . The secondary attack rate of this current episode was compared with the preceding COVID - 19 outbreak in a restaurant ( Outbreak R1 ) on 19 th February 2021 . Outbreak R1 occurred in a period prior to the mandatory implementation of enhancement of air dilution . 2 . 3 Estimation of quanta generation Estimation of quanta generation in outbreak R2 and R1 was carried out by using a steady - state mathematical model to describe the transmission of airborne infectious diseases , which is known as the Wells - Riley equation . 20 The volume of air and the air change rate were measured to calculate the virus - free air in R2 and R1 . An aerosol deposition rate of 0 . 30 h â1 and virus deactivation rate of 0 . 63 h â1 were adopted as described previously . 21 The pulmonary flow rate per susceptible person of 0 . 15 L / s was used for the estimation . The median duration of exposure to the infectious case among the susceptible person was recorded . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 6 2 . 4 Study design and participants This is a descriptive epidemiological study to evaluate the effect of enhancement of air dilution in the restaurant on the secondary attack rate during COVID - 19 outbreak . For the air crew who was required to undergo compulsory testing for COVID - 19 in the community testing centers , those symptomatic patients , and asymptomatic persons who were tested for contact tracing due to potential exposure to a COVID - 19 confirmed case , combined nasal and throat swabs were collected by staff with medical and healthcare training in the community testing centers , or inside the hospitals including the newly built temporary hospital adjacent to the community treatment facility at AsiaWorld - Expo in Hong Kong . Respiratory specimens such as nasopharyngeal swabs , throat swabs , and sputum were collected for serial monitoring of viral load by RT - PCR upon hospitalization . Deep throat saliva was accepted as an alternative specimen . 22 Whole genome sequencing was performed directly on respiratory specimens or deep throat saliva from laboratory - confirmed COVID - 19 cases . This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of The University of Hong Kong / Hospital Authority Hong Kong West Hospital Cluster . 2 . 5 Whole genome sequencing Whole - genome sequencing of SARS - CoV - 2 was performed using Nanopore sequencing technology ( Oxford Nanopore Technologies , Oxford , UK ) as we previously described . 23 Briefly , RNA extracted from respiratory specimens by QIAamp Viral RNA Kit ( Qiagen , Hilden , Germany ) was reverse transcribed into cDNA using SuperScriptTM IV reverse transcriptase ( ThermoFisher Scientific , Waltham , MA , USA ) . PCR was then performed using the ARTIC nCov - 2019 V3 Panel ( IDT , USA ) and Q5Â® Hot Start High - Fidelity 2X Master Mix ( New England Biolabs , Ipswich , Massachusetts , United States ) . PCR J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 7 products clean - up was done by 1x Agencourt AMPure XP ( Beckman Coulter , California , USA ) . End - prep , barcode ligation and sequencing adaptor ligation were performed according to the PCR tiling of SARS - CoV - 2 virus with Native Barcoding Expansion 96 protocol ( Version : PTCN _ 9103 _ v109 _ revH _ 13Jul2020 ) . The library was loaded and sequenced on MinION with R9 . 4 . 1 flow cells for 48 h . Nanopore sequencing data were analyzed using Artic Network nCoV - 2019 novel coronavirus bioinformatics protocol . 24 2 . 6 Phylogenetic analysis The sequences were first aligned using MAFFT . 25 The maximum - likelihood whole genome phylogenetic tree was constructed using IQTREE . 26 The best fit substitution model was chosen automatically according to the bayesian information criterion score ( BIC ) . Then 1000 ultrafast bootstraps were applied to calculate the final tree . The unrelated substructures of the tree with branch length representing mutation count of less than 1 were removed using the - czb option . Finally , the SARS - CoV - 2 reference genome ( accession no . : MN908947 . 3 ) is chosen as the outgroup representative . 2 . 7 Statistical Analysis Differences in the secondary attack rates of SARS - CoV - 2 acquisition in the restaurants were evaluated between outbreak R1 and R2 which occurred before and after the implementation of enhancement measure of indoor air dilution , in particular in persons with or without wearing masks , using Chi - square test or Fisher exact test for categorical variables . Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics ( version 26 ) . A two - sided p - value of < 0 . 05 was considered statistically significant .

Results 3 . 1 Epidemiology of COVID - 19 in Hong Kong By 31 st December 2021 , there were 12 , 655 laboratory - confirmed COVID - 19 cases in Hong Kong of whom 6 , 113 ( 48 . 3 % ) male . The median age was 43 years ( range , 1 month to 100 years ) . The overall case - fatality rate was 1 . 7 % ( 213 / 12 , 655 ) . The weekly number of COVID - 19 cases was illustrated in Figure 1 . Imported cases and their secondary cases constituted 26 . 1 % ( 3306 / 12 , 655 ) of all COVID - 19 patients . The proportion of imported cases and their secondary cases was significantly increased to 99 . 3 % ( 807 / 813 ) from 1 st June 2021 to 31 st December 2021 ( p < 0 . 001 ) . The first case of Omicron variant was retrospectively recognized in an imported case on 15 th November 2021 . One hundred and thirty - four ( 50 . 0 % ) of 268 imported cases were infected by Omicron variant between 15 th November 2021 to 31 st December 2021 ( Figure 2 ) . 3 . 2 Restaurant related COVID - 19 outbreaks before and after enhancement of air dilution in catering premises A 44 - year - old male air crew who might have not complied with the administrative requirement of home quarantine after returning from the United States on 25 th December 2021 . He had symptoms of headache on 26 th December 2021 , but he attended a restaurant ( R2 ) for lunch with his father on 27 th December 2021 ( 13 : 16 to 14 : 54 ) , when he still complained of headache on that day . He was subsequently confirmed to have Omicron J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 9 variant by regular compulsory testing at community testing center per protocol on 27 th December 2021 in the evening ( case 1 , index case ) with a cycle threshold ( Ct ) value of 21 . Based on the record on dining table reservation , credit card payment , and closed - circuit television of R2 , a total of 207 persons who attended the restaurant for lunch were exposed to the index case between 13 : 00 to 15 : 00 , 27 th December 2021 . They , together with 22 staff serving at R2 , were sent to quarantine camp for observation . Review of closed - circuit television showed that the index case did not leave the seat during the entire duration of lunch . Outbreak R2 involved 7 secondary cases of Omicron variant , who were diagnosed during the quarantine period ( Table 1 ) . Of these 7 secondary cases , the median age was 50 years ( range : 13 to 76 years ) . Symptomatic infection was observed in 5 ( 71 . 4 % ) of 7 cases , with the median onset 5 days after exposure ( range : 3 to 7 days after exposure ) . All of them had completed 2 doses of COVID - 19 vaccine at a median of 164 days prior to exposure ( range : 129 to 238 days ) . All secondary cases were customers who did not wear masks while staying in the dining area of R2 , resulting in a secondary attack rate of 3 . 4 % ( 7 / 207 ) among the customers ( Table 2 ) . The restaurant R2 ( 245 m 2 , 0 . 84 customer per m 2 ) is adjacent to another restaurant R3 ( 70 m 2 ) , where they are interconnected by a doorway in the middle , but have separate entrance and kitchen . The primary air handling unit ( PAU ) is located at R3 , and fresh air is distributed to the R3 and R2 . The PAU rate capacity was 5400 m 3 / hour , and designated ACH for the whole premises is equivalent to 5 . 7 . Following the on - site measurement of the outdoor air supply in air ducts on 30 th December 2021 in R2 , the ACH in the seating area was 2 . 0 . Ultraviolet - C air purifier system was installed in R2 to comply with Hong Kong legal requirement . 27 There were 14 UV - C air purifiers installed at the ceiling of the restaurant ( ranging from 3 . 4 â 4 . 1 m above ground level ) , all near the return air grille of the fan coil unit ( FCU ) . All air purifiers were under normal operation on the day when the index case visited J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 10 on 27 th December 2021 . The restaurant was suggested to improve the air balancing and augment distribution of fresh air supply to R2 . The post - adjustment ACH was 4 . 6 in seating area . Smoke test was conducted on 4 th January 2022 , which demonstrated dominant flow from entrance to kitchen across the seating area . Smoke test also demonstrated inward flow and leakage of smoke through crevices into VIP rooms ( Figure 3a & 3b ) . The relative position of the table of index case and the tables of the secondary cases was also shown in Figure 3a & 3b . The vertical airflow in R2 was illustrated in Figure 4 . Outbreak R1 occurred on 19 th February 2021 . The outbreak was located at the ground level of R1 ( 138 m 2 , 0 . 55 customer per m 2 ) . All the affected cases , with the median age of 54 years ( range : 33 to 74 years ) , were located at the ground level seating area , and the ACH measured onsite was 1 . 2 . There was no air purifier installed in R1 . All customers and restaurant staff were not vaccinated and quarantined according to the prevailing policy of public health measures . The secondary attack rates of customers and restaurant staff were 28 . 9 % ( 22 / 76 ) and 52 . 6 % ( 10 / 19 ) , respectively , during the quarantine period . The improvement of indoor air dilution with installation of air purifiers and upper - room ultraviolet - C germicidal irradiation significantly decreased the secondary attack rate during COVID - 19 outbreak among the customers in the Chinese restaurants ( Table 2 ) . The number of restaurant clustering per 100 episodes of exposure by COVID - 19 patients was inversely related to the number of air purifiers being installed in the restaurants ( Figure 5 ) . 3 . 3 Estimation of quanta generation Given the aerosol deposition rate ( 0 . 30 h â1 ) , virus deactivation rate ( 0 . 63 h â 1 ) , and the pulmonary flow rate per susceptible person ( 0 . 15 L / s ) in R2 and R1 , the quanta generation rate was estimated in R2 and R1 . In R2 , the virus - free air was 2530 . 2 L / s . Of 207 customers , J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 11 7 infected secondary cases were exposed with a median of 0 . 57 h . The estimated quanta generation rate was 1023 . 4 quanta per h in R2 . In R1 , the virus - free air was 232 . 5 L / s . Of 76 customers , 22 infected secondary cases were exposed with a median of 0 . 95 h . The estimated quanta generation rate was 557 . 7 quanta per h in R2 . 3 . 4 Whole genome phylogenetic analysis Whole genome sequencing was performed for the 8 cases in the cluster in R2 ( Figure 6 ) . Phylogenetic tree showed that they clustered together . Four cases had identical sequence ( case 1 - index case , case 2 , case 3 and case 5 ) . For cases 4 and 6 , there was one additional mutation ( A19950G ) . For case 8 , there was on addition mutation ( G3947A ) . For case 7 , there were two additional mutations ( C12459T and A19950G ) . The phylogenetic analysis of the infected cases in outbreak R1 were also cluster together suggestive of transmission in R1 ( Supplementary Figure ) . Discussion With the evolution of COVID - 19 pandemic , there has been increasing evidence of airborne transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 , 28 especially in the poorly ventilated indoor areas . 29 - 31 Dining places and bars were considered as the high - risk area for COVID - 19 outbreaks as people may interact closely without wearing masks . 32 - 34 In fact , social gathering with mask - off activities has been shown to increase the risk of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission during the early phase of COVID - 19 pandemic . 14 In Hong Kong , the first community outbreak of COVID - 19 with superspreading event was attributed to the family gathering and dining in a commercial party room . 35 During the subsequent waves of COVID - 19 , there were at least 12 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 12 restaurants related COVID - 19 outbreaks with an average of 23 infected cases per each outbreak episode ( unpublished data ) until the report of outbreak R1 in February 2021 . Poor ventilation or indoor air dilution worsens short - range and even long - range airborne transmission of respiratory viruses including SARS - CoV - 2 . Based on the analysis using a macroscopic aerosol balance model , the risk of airborne transmission of respiratory viruses was high , but a ventilation rate of 10 L / s per person provided a similar concentration and distance decay profile to that in outdoor settings . 36 Of the COVID - 19 outbreak with probable long - range airborne transmission in a restaurant , the measured ventilation rate was only 0 . 9 L / s per person . 32 Similarly , insufficient ventilation may probably lead to long - range airborne transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 on two buses where the time - averaged ventilation rates were approximately 1 . 7 and 3 . 2 L / s per person , respectively . 37 With these findings , the Hong Kong Government stipulated on infection control grounds a requirement on a standard of air change or the use of air purifier to be complied with in the indoor seating area of dine within catering premises in March 2021 . 11 It provides an opportunity for us to investigate the effect of enhancement of indoor air dilution on the extent of COVID - 19 outbreak by measuring the secondary attack rate . Before the implementation of enhanced indoor air dilution , the overall secondary attack rate of COVID - 19 in outbreak R1 ( 33 . 4 % ) was two times higher than that of the household contacts . 38 The postulation of airborne transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 may not fully explain the unusually high secondary attack rate among the restaurant staff as they were supposed to wear masks all the time at work . Wearing mask in the healthcare setting has already been shown to minimize the nosocomial transmission of respiratory viruses . 39 , 40 The risk of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission during their social gathering may not be completely excluded . Therefore , we analyzed the secondary attack rate of COVID - 19 among the customers , which should have fewer confounding factors . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 13 After the enhancement of indoor air dilution in the restaurant , the secondary attack rate of COVID - 19 was significantly lower in outbreak R2 than that in outbreak R1 . On - site investigation demonstrated a strong air current from entrance to kitchen that may drag the virus - laden aerosol exhaled from the index case to other parts of the restaurant . Theoretically , increased indoor air dilution may also reduce the air stagnation and minimize the risk of short - range airborne transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 . Therefore , except for the father of index case , staying in the same table at a distance of less than 1 meter , those sitting immediately next to the table of index case were not infected . However , it appears unusual to find the remaining 6 secondary cases who were sitting at the corner of the restaurant . In fact , three of 6 secondary cases were staying into 2 different VIP rooms , where air may pass through the gaps of partitions used to segregate the rooms . It is postulated that local stagnation at the corner with inadequate fresh air and insufficient air mixing may result in recirculation of contaminated air without air exchange in that zone ; hence the distribution of secondary cases was all located at the corners of the restaurant . Since the ultraviolet - C air purifiers were located at a relatively high level , and there was inadequate mixing of air especially at physical corners , this may affect their efficacy at locations with poor air mixing . Moreover , ultraviolet - C air purifier can only reduce , but not completely eliminate the risk of COVID - 19 infection by virus - laden aerosols . Transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 by the indirect contact via fomites or droplet route might also be possible in R2 . However , the practice of infection control and other preventive measures in R2 has been found to be satisfactory upon interviewing their staff concerned and reviewing the closed - circuit television record . The restaurant was divided into 4 zones where a designated team of staff was assigned to serve each zone to reduce the risk of cross - contamination . Except for case 2 who sat adjacent to the index case in the same table , the other secondary cases were located outside the zone of index case and also distributed in 3 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 14 different zones . The likelihood of contact or droplet transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 was low in this outbreak . Whole genome sequencing of the Omicron variant revealed identical nucleotide sequence in 4 patients , including the index case , while one nucleotide difference in 3 patients . Presumably , these cases were phylogenetically related . However , case 7 , a 13 - year old girl had two nucleotide differences compared with the index case , and also had one nucleotide difference with case 4 , who was her mother , sitting in Table 95 inside the VIP room . Based on the phylogenetic analysis , case 7 may also acquire COVID - 19 from her mother , instead of acquiring the infection from the index case during her stay in R2 , especially the symptom onset of case 7 was later than case 4 by 4 days . Therefore , genomic analysis may provide new insight to enrich the epidemiological investigation . Regardless of the possibility of second or third generation infection of case 7 , we did include this case in the calculation of secondary attack rate in outbreak R2 for comparison with that in outbreak R1 , where whole genome sequencing also demonstrated a phylogenetic clustering suggestive of a point source outbreak . Airborne transmission of COVID - 19 becomes a great concern , especially with the emergence of Omicron variant of greater basic reproduction number . 5 Our serial air sampling conducted in the airborne infection isolation facilitates designated for COVID - 19 patients have eventually demonstrated the presence of viral RNA in the air samples . 16 , 41 , 42 Airborne transmission with superspreading phenomenon was also observed in the medical ward with 6 ACH , 43 posing a new challenge to our infection control and prevention measures in the hospitals . 18 Therefore , it would be impossible to achieve zero SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in the restaurant . The enhancement measures of indoor air dilution can only reduce the risk of transmission as illustrated in our comparison of secondary attack rates between two COVID - 19 outbreaks in the restaurants . Restaurant remains a high - risk area , especially if crowded and poorly ventilated , for all variants and not only Omicron . In outbreak R2 and R1 , the J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 15 estimated quanta generation rate was 1023 . 4 h - 1 and 557 . 6 h - 1 , respectively , which is much higher than the estimated quanta generation rate of 79 . 3 h - 1 in a restaurant outbreak , and 35 . 0 h - 1 and 58 . 3 h - 1 in a two buses outbreak in early 2020 . 32 , 37 Although the quanta generation rate for the Omicron variant in R2 is 83 . 5 % larger than that for the non - Omicron variant in R1 , the secondary attack rate is much lower in R2 ( 3 . 4 % ) than in R1 ( 28 . 9 % ) , suggesting that enhancement of indoor air dilution may mitigate the SARS - CoV - 2 transmission . While the catering premises are adopting our recommendation by improving the indoor air dilution with installation of air purifier and ultraviolet germicidal irradiation , it is more important to educate the public of not attending restaurants if they have respiratory symptoms suggestive of COVID - 19 . It is because even completion of two or three doses COVID - 19 vaccination may not be able to protect against infection by Omicron variant . However , extra costs are required for energy consumption and materials of upgrading heating and ventilation systems to reduce infection risk . 44 In the modern heating , ventilation , and air conditioning systems , increasing ventilation can be overly costly with limited benefit since indoor air must be maintained at a given temperature and humidity , while improving filtration may deliver more benefit with less cost . There are several limitations in this study . First , we are not able to compare the secondary attack rates of all COVID - 19 outbreaks in the restaurants in Hong Kong . It is because the practice of contact tracing has been evolving during the COVID - 19 pandemic that not all exposed persons in the restaurants were quarantined in the initial phase of COVID - 19 . Secondly , the epidemiological background of two outbreaks in R1 and R2 may be heterogeneous in terms of the area occupied per customer , vaccination rate among the secondary cases , and more importantly , the difference in SARS - CoV - 2 variants . All secondary cases in outbreak R1 were not vaccinated because the COVID - 19 vaccination program was launched on 26 February 2021 ( 7 days after the onset of outbreak R1 ) . However , J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 16 all secondary cases in outbreak R2 were fully vaccinated because of lower neutralizing antibody against the Omicron variant among the vaccine recipients . 7 Thirdly , it is not possible for us to perform an aerodynamic study in detail because the fresh air supply was augmented soon after the COVID - 19 outbreak . However , smoke test demonstrated the direction of airflow and that the finding provided valuable information to support our epidemiological investigation . Although the improvement of indoor air dilution is not definitely associated with the reduction of secondary cases of COVID - 19 in outbreak R2 , the role of indoor air dilution and risk of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission warrant further investigation . 45 Declaration of Competing Interest All authors declare no conflict of interest Acknowledgement We thank our frontline staff and management team of Centre for Health Protection , Department of Health and Hospital Authority to facilitate this study .

Floor plan of the restaurant with outbreak of SARS - CoV - 2 Omicron variant Note of Figure 3a . The table marked in red with customers infected with COVID - 19 . The red dotted line indicated that the restaurant was divided into 4 different zones with designated staff working in each zone . Table 35 , 36 , 37 , 95 , 96 , 97 were located in a VIP room , while Table 101 was located in another VIP room . The arrow in blue indicated the direction of airflow from the entrance to the kitchen as demonstrated by smoke test in the air layer occupied by the customers . The blue dotted line indicated the tiny gaps of partitions which were used to segregate the VIP rooms and also at the entrance of the restaurant . Note of Figure 3b . The direction of airflow in the upper air layer is illustrated . The arrow in blue indicated the direction of clean air ( upper unpolluted zone ) from the entrance . The arrow in red indicated the direction of contaminated air at the upper polluted zone after passing through the index case in Table A2 . Figure 4 . Schematic representation of vertical airflow in the restaurant ( R2 ) with outbreak of Omicron variant Note . The upper partial layer which was polluted by the rising exhaled air stream assisted by rising plumes of body and even warm food . The cool clean air generated from the fan coil units with upper - room ultraviolet germicidal irradiation ( UVGI ) , and also mainly from entrance . For the corner or the two VIP rooms ( illustrated by the blue dotted line ) , if their temperature was lower than the main area , there would be a bi - directional flow with upper inflow and lower outflow . This would explain why the air as polluted by the index case would âjumpâ to the âdistantâ corner or VIP rooms , and somehow bypass the main area tables .

Environmental implication In view of the increased airborne transmissibility of Omicron variant , it would be difficult to prevent the SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in the indoor areas , especially in the restaurants , which should be regarded as the high - risk area where people take off the masks during dining . Our study demonstrated that the risk of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission could be significantly reduced in the restaurant , even for Omicron variant , after the implementation of enhancing measure in the ventilation with installation of high - efficiency particular air filter and ultraviolet - C germicidal irradiation .
