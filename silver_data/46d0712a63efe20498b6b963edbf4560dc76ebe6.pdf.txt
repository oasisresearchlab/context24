INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND Figure 1 : Parallel chat ( yellow box ) in a video meeting on Microsoft Teams . This parallel chat is typically open to all meeting invitees and fows concurrently with the A / V focus of the meeting . The COVID - 19 pandemic has thrown the use of parallel chat in video meetings into sharp relief , yet it is largely overlooked as an optimisation tar - get for tools and best practices . Meeting platforms provide only brief instructions [ 61 ] , and even comprehensive remote work guides are largely quiet on the subject [ 2 ] . Their design is limited to text panes , windows , or overlays , and while machine learning has enabled live meeting transcription and translation ( e . g . [ 23 , 44 ] , it has not yet impacted meeting chat . As parallel chat becomes commonplace , we CHI ’21 Extended Abstracts , May 8 – 13 , 2021 , Yokohama , Japan A . Sarkar , S . Rintel , D . Borowiec , R . Bergmann , S . Gillet , D . Bragg , N . Baym , & A . Sellen need to better understand its opportunities and challenges so that we can recommend improvements in practices and design . 1 . 1 Prior Work Video - mediated collaboration evolved alongside and often with chat in asynchronous and quasi - synchronous workspaces [ 46 ] , but while research collections of video - mediated communication [ 18 ] , media spaces [ 25 ] , and remote work [ 32 ] provide frameworks and designs for multi - modal collaboration , there is surprisingly little prior ex - ploration of parallel chat in video meetings . Rather , parallelism is discussed in terms of A / V side conversations [ 10 ] , combining digital and physical resources [ 9 ] , and enabling non - A / V resources [ 30 ] . While task efectiveness , trust , or other values have been com - pared and contrasted in videoconferencing against other modalities [ 8 , 16 , 45 ] , comparisons of video meetings with and without parallel chat are not available . In work contexts , video - meeting research on attention and multi - tasking has noted parallel chat as one among many distractions [ 11 , 34 , 41 ] , but not provided detail . The most evidence we have comes from educational contexts , in which live online A / V of teacher presentations and student - teacher or student - student interactions is accompanied by a chat ‘backchan - nel’ [ 4 , 60 ] . Its advantages include enabling questions , clarifcations , afrmations , and posting resources . Everyone may contribute simul - taneously , including less those vocal , which develops community and maintains engagement . However , parallel chat has the major disadvantage of being dis - tracting . Again , from the educational context , beyond the obvious problem of students having of - topic discussions , even when on - topic there is a danger of “processing information at increasingly superfcial levels while [ attempting ] to juggle tasks and transfer attention across multiple domains simultaneously” [ 27 , 60 ] . This “continuous partial inattention” [ 42 ] may permeate down to the micro level , and efect everyone in the encounter , e . g . teachers using parallel chat to scafold language teaching via Skype may disattend some student disfuencies [ 31 ] . Yardi [ 60 ] argues for ex - ploring how scafolding , permeability , and assisted moderation in backchannels might change educational dynamics , but notes that contextual etiquette ( s ) will need to evolve to deal with distraction . The other disadvantage of parallel chat is that it may not be accessible or inclusive . This has at least two strands . First , given the increasingly global work environment , we should no longer assume that all participants can engage equally in single dominant language chat . Manual instant annotation of chat - based brainstorming and decision - making has been found to improve cross - cultural partici - pation [ 35 ] , but such annotation has not made the jump to parallel chat in video meetings . Second , in the U . S . , 26 % of adults have some form of disability [ 19 ] , and similar fgures can be found worldwide . However , work on accessibility of online meetings , work environ - ments , and education [ 7 , 15 , 29 , 52 ] , and accessibility guidelines [ 1 , 33 ] , has not focused on parallel chat . Livestreaming services incorporate parallel chat for audiences watching content as diverse as video gameplay [ 24 ] , eating [ 14 ] , and events [ 55 ] . Hosts have learned to permeate their streams with au - dience engagement techniques in the chat [ 13 , 58 ] [ 57 ] , but the chat is also rife with abuse and spam that is amplifed by imitation , such that hosts have also had to learn how to shape pro and anti - social behavior with moderation and example - setting [ 53 ] . Livestreaming services themselves are developing more holistic multi - modal expe - riences , such as “Danmaku " , in which text and reactions foat over video [ 36 , 37 , 40 , 59 ] . Danmaku concepts have not yet made the jump to parallel chat in commercial video meeting systems , with the exception of foating reactions and hand - raising [ 43 ] . This may be entirely understandable given that its combination of modalities seems to be a high cognitive load just to comprehend , let alone engage with . However , research on the StreamWiki [ 38 ] system has found that , in the context of knowledge sharing live streaming , Danmaku can be combined with other techniques to enable viewers to interactively learn material as well as help producers and mod - erators produce useful archives of interactive learning experiences for future asynchronous use . Parallel chat in work video meetings has evolved somewhat under the noses of researchers , and yet there are clearly signifcant challenges for both practice and design if multi - modal engagement is becoming a professional expectation . 2 METHOD Between mid - April and mid - August 2020 , we conducted a large scale study of Microsoft employees’ experiences in remote meet - ings while working from due to COVID - 19 . To enable global data collection over a signifcant period of time and covering multiple topics ( of which parallel chat was just one ) , and to provide a rich quantitative and qualitative picture , diaries were used to capture changing refections on experiences or similar experiences at dif - ferent times [ 47 ] , and these were augmented with one - of polls on specifc topics to dive more deeply into specifc topics [ 5 ] . Recruited via internal mailing lists between April and June , 849 participants completed the onboarding study , 715 completed at least one diary entry , and 357 at least one poll . For this report we draw from the onboarding survey , a poll on parallel chat , and relevant diary en - tries . Full methodology and participation details are available in a technical report [ 49 ] . Our parallel chat poll received 149 responses . Participants an - swered six questions about their use and experience of parallel chat using a 7 - point Likert scale ( Strongly Disagree - Strongly Agree ) . The questions and the breakdown of responses can be seen in Fig - ure 2 . The poll ended with the free text prompt : “What experience / s led to your answers above ? For example : Does chat become more or less distracting or useful depending on the type of meeting , or the meeting size ? Are there diferent kinds of chat during meetings ? Do you feel obligated to use text chat in meetings ? ” We included exam - ple prompts for the free text response to encourage participants to explain the reasoning for their Likert scale responses . Participants could also author up to 24 diary entries , organized in three cycles of eight guided topics : Physical workspace , Interaction , Productivity , Tools , Multitasking , Types of meetings , Time in meet - ings , and Approaches to meetings . In these entries , participants occasionally mentioned parallel chat experiences without respect to a specifc question as they did in the poll . In total 159 unique participants mentioned 331 parallel chat issues in the diaries . A key linked participants to onboarding , diary , and poll data . Verbatims were scrubbed for all identifying referents . For qualitative analysis of the verbatims we used semantic thematic analysis [ 6 ] to The promise and peril of parallel chat in video meetings for work CHI ’21 Extended Abstracts , May 8 – 13 , 2021 , Yokohama , Japan group responses representing how participants used parallel chat and their evaluations of its efectiveness . One researcher coded the poll verbatims and another coded the diary verbatims ( both to saturation ) and then the team aggregated themes [ 20 ] . Throughout the paper we indicate in parentheses the number of individuals who mentioned a theme at least once . 3 RESULTS Parallel chat in video meetings was common for a substantial ma - jority of participants . From the onboarding survey ( N = 849 ) , 69 . 7 % reported using parallel chat . Of the total , 26 . 6 % reported using par - allel chat in every meeting or almost every meeting , 24 . 1 % at least once a week , 16 . 8 % a few times a month , and 2 . 1 % once a month or less . In our poll ( N = 149 ) ( Figure 2 ) , most respondents reported an increase in parallel chat use after the shift to remote work . Respon - dents were polarized over whether parallel chat was distracting . However , they were positive about the value of chat for helping with conversational issues and adding resources , and most felt it was a net positive . P3 : [ . . . ] I very frequently use text chat to share links , screenshots , etc . that are relevant to the discussion , as well as quick thoughts / signals of assent with the speaker , if I don’t want to interrupt the main thread . On the whole , I fnd the ability to have concurrent chat very helpful for efective meetings , even if it can be a distraction at times . P154 : [ . . . ] there have been meetings where important links were able to be provided in the text chat , important and * relevant * topics were brought up and then incorporated into the meeting , etc – these are times when I feel like I really could not live without [ it ] [ . . . ] . Most respondents found that use of parallel chat had increased for both themselves ( 72 % ) and others ( 76 % ) since mandatory work - ing from home ( aggregating “Somewhat Agree” , “Agree” , and “Strongly Agree” ) . This is likely due to increased remote meetings [ 3 ] and increased appreciation for the uses of parallel chat . Participants in both the poll and diaries reported using parallel chat for at least seven distinct types of messages : • Questions for the speaker or someone else in the meeting ( 96 participants ) • Links to resources such as documents and webpages ( 64 participants ) • Unrelated conversation held in the same chat ( 44 partici - pants ) . • Voicing agreement with the speaker , or sending messages of praise / congratulations ( ‘kudos’ ) . ( 40 participants ) • Adding information to what is being said , or starting a con - versation about a related topic ( 37 participants ) • Responses to previous messages ( 34 participants ) • Humour and casual conversation ( 26 participants ) 3 . 1 Positive impacts of parallel chat 3 . 1 . 1 Inclusion and managing the flow of the primary conversation . A key advantage of parallel chat is participation without interrupt - ing the fow of the A / V conversation ( 62 participants ) . Being able to ask a question or make a comment in parallel chat may reduce the competition for the foor [ 12 , 17 ] as defned by the A / V stage , because there is another space in which to have their say . With less competition , there may be in turn , fewer moments of the stop - start competitive overlaps [ 21 ] which occur due to latency [ 48 , 50 , 51 , 54 ] and constrained visual cues [ 9 , 26 , 39 ] . P670 : [ . . . ] in person , there are visual cues a person wants to speak - a hand raised , a lean forward , a clearing of the throat . We don’t have those cues in video meetings [ . . . ] [ It is an ] ever - more - important way , especially as meetings get larger [ . . . ] . P217 : [ . . . ] I’ve found it most useful when we are on a tight schedule and there are several speakers . Once I’m done presenting , and have handed of to another speaker , I usually get on chat to answer all the questions that arose - this helps manage time better & helps me provide links to answers where necessary , which would beneft everyone . P349 : [ . . . ] It has also been wonderful when doing demos , because customers can ask questions ( and we often answer them ) in text chat vs . interrupting the demo . [ . . . ] Moreover , parallel chat gives participants a way to engage if they are otherwise unable to get a chance to speak . Even though Microsoft Teams and other systems now include hand - raise features that mark a participant as desiring a turn , these may go unnoticed or there may simply be too many to accommodate . Parallel chat ofers a way to have a say while avoiding the risk of a hand - raise not being seen . Further , since a hand raise is a contextless bid for the foor , asking a question or a comment in the parallel chat enables a method for speakers or moderators to triage potential engagement . In this way , parallel chat may make meetings more inclusive ( 41 participants ) . P208 : Text chat can be a great way for more introverted members of staf to contribute to a conversation . [ . . . ] P640 : [ . . . ] It also allows users who have distracting home lives to participate without fear of judgment . [ . . . ] P153 : [ . . . ] people contributing through chat that might not have a voice otherwise – either limited by technology ( no microphone ) , environment ( loud , distracting ) or personal preference ( shy , new , still fnding the way in the team’s culture . ) P222 : [ . . . ] It helps level the “playing feld” by allowing all partici - pants to have a voice and engage by sharing ideas and opinions , [ . . . ] it’s one of the most valuable meeting capabilities [ . . . ] 3 . 1 . 2 Coordination of action and collaboration . Another key func - tion of parallel chat is to share links to relevant resources and documents ( 64 participants ) . Many participants noted that such sharing might have otherwise been follow - up actions . Moreover , as some platforms enable parallel chat to persist beyond the end of the A / V meeting , it can act as both a record and a means of enabling post - meeting discussion ( 34 participants ) . P12 : [ . . . ] individuals will reference external materials , items , specs , etc and when they include a link to the referenced material it provides clarity that has made a huge impact on my comprehension – especially in areas that are new to me . P584 : [ . . . ] it has the nice side efect of having a record of those resources shared or links provided in meetings . [ . . . ] P168 : [ . . . ] Being able to add documentation , links and relevant information during a meeting and starting a chat that can continue post meeting has really helped cut down on follow ups . Parallel chat also enables coordination pathways in the face of technical issues such as poor connectivity , device / software mal - functions , camera / microphone issues , etc .

Sellen Figure 2 : Parallel chat poll ( N = 149 ) results for all six Likert questions . with language barriers , and written precision when it is useful ( e . g . technical terms ) . P47 : [ . . . ] [ When ] one of the participants are on their phone and can’t see the presentation [ . . . ] we end up sending a screenshot of the current presented screen and the person on the phone can quickly check the chat . [ . . . ] P658 : [ . . . ] useful to convey information that is hard to convey orally : links , names or contact info , sometimes images , etc . P260 : Usually text chat is relevant links and spellings for technical words , so it has been a great beneft . P97 : [ . . . ] It helps if you want to ask question but broadband is poor or there is noise at your end . 3 . 1 . 3 Social connection . Casual conversation and humour can give meetings a greater sense of social support and connection , making them more interpersonal and pleasurable ( 26 participants ) . P642 : [ . . . ] chat provides me an easy way to interact with meeting participants , creating a feeling of participation and providing a sense of the general mood [ . . . ] it makes the meetings more personal . P42 : [ . . . ] we use text chat to send ‘cheers’ and fun gifs to celebrate moments [ . . . ] this tends to generate a lot of enthusiasm and makes these types of meetings more fun . like people’s personalities coming out . [ . . . ] P173 : [ . . . ] a place where people can express themselves casually , or ofer support to the presenter . [ . . . ] 3 . 2 Negative impacts of parallel chat 3 . 2 . 1 Distraction and division of atention . Parallel chat provides room for unrelated topics to emerge , distracting meeting partic - ipants who wish to focus on the meeting topic ( 68 participants ) . Participants may feel obliged to divide their attention between the A / V and the parallel chat , and many report this division to be difcult to maintain ( 43 participants ) . P579 : It’s very distracting in large meetings and often is of topic . There are separate conversations occurring between a small few people amongst themselves . P692 : [ . . . ] A large meeting where the text chat is busy with a con - stant stream of loosely related comments [ . . . ] If I paid attention to text chat and tried to keep up with it , I would no longer be paying attention to the meeting itself [ . . . ] . P245 : [ . . . ] sometimes it’s very distracting as multiple threads are happening that get tangential from the main presenter / speaker . [ . . . ] it’s really hard to keep track of multiple conversations AND pay attention to the speaker . 3 . 2 . 2 Difering expectations on how chat should be used . Infor - mality and side conversations were perceived negatively by some participants ( 25 participants ) , with some reporting difculty fnding important information in chat due to message volume or topic irrel - evancy ( 16 participants ) . Some expressed a desire for more concrete norms and expectations around parallel chat use ( 15 participants ) . Others reported having designated moderators , whether to ensure professionalism and respectful behaviour , or to monitor the fow of the meeting and ensure voices are heard ( 43 participants ) . P305 : Unless it’s stated up front and managed well during the meet - ing , putting something in the chat window still stops the presentation , everyone stops to read or ( in most cases ) someone who didn’t text in the chat window calls out that the meeting needs to pause as someone else has a question . It still causes a distraction . P779 : [ . . . ] Value really depends on call / how participants are using it : in some cases it provides great value , in other cases people use it to socialize , joke , where it can be more distraction than value . [ . . . ] P14 : It feels increasingly important to monitor meeting chats along - side the AV component – especially in large meetings . People contribute many kinds of comments [ . . . ] 3 . 2 . 3 Information asymmetries . Meeting presenters reported that it was hard to engage with the parallel chat , both in terms of at - tentional efort and limitations of the platform’s interface ( 27 par - ticipants ) . Further , without timestamps linked to A / V , references to parallel chat in meeting recordings were difcult to follow post - hoc , and conversely , visiting the chat afterwards without the A / V context could be confusing ( 18 participants ) . P159 : [ . . . ] it would be useful for the presenter to see the chat when presenting . A function to highlight questions as opposed to links or comments would be great , too . P153 : [ . . . ] I have to keep an eye on the text chat as a presenter , and address points raised / questions asked . But sometimes there is The promise and peril of parallel chat in video meetings for work CHI ’21 Extended Abstracts , May 8 – 13 , 2021 , Yokohama , Japan so much chatter of agreement / memes / personal anecdotes that it is hard to fnd the more important messages . [ . . . ] P350 : [ . . . ] as a presenter it is almost impossible to keep up with chat and present coherently . [ . . . ] Additionally , for recorded meetings , [ . . . ] [ it is hard when people ] refer to something in the chat that the listener has no context for . 3 . 3 Factors afecting parallel chat use and outcomes 3 . 3 . 1 Demographic factors . We found no relationships with mean - ingful efect sizes between participants’ chat use and their job role ( e . g . , engineering , research , sales , etc . ) or prior work from home status . However , as noted above , women in the age group 25 - 34 were more likely to strongly agree that their chat use has increased , in comparison to any other gender - age group ( Figure 3 ) ( 59 % of women aged 25 - 34 , versus 27 % across all well - represented groups in our sample ; Z = 2 . 9924 , p = 0 . 00278 ) . Figure 3 : Increased chat use was most reported by women aged 25 - 34 . The fgure shows the proportion responding ‘strongly agree’ that their own chat use has increased . Age groups below 25 / above 64 omitted due to low sample size . A similar fnding was refected in the relative frequency of themes in the combined journal and poll verbatims : women were twice as likely as men to report using parallel chat for questions and answers during meetings ( 16 % of women , versus 8 % of men ; Z = 3 . 3998 , p = 0 . 00068 ) . This may be because women , particularly younger women , fnd it difcult to be heard in meetings , which is consistent with research on gender and meeting participation [ 28 ] . 3 . 3 . 2 Meeting type and team dynamics . Several participants ob - served that chat can be both benefcial and distracting , depending on the nature of the meeting and its participants . Major distinc - tions were drawn depending on the size of the group , whether the meeting was in the form of a talk / presentation , and how familiar the participants were with each other . The likelihood of distraction was greater both in large meetings and presentations . However , some participants felt the opposite : that the use of informal mes - sages made a large group discussion feel more community - minded , inclusive , and energetic . Participants were more conservative with their chat use when the audience was unfamiliar , but within the context of a regular team meeting , participants developed norms around chat use , whether explicit or unspoken . P267 : I’m torn - it’s satisfying in some ways to be able to chime in and interact - we give each other a lot of hearts on my team , but it totally pulls away from the presentations . P252 : Distractions are less about the use of chat and more about the people involved . Sometimes there is conversation amongst participants that doesn’t directly align with the content - other times it stays somewhat quiet . I think it is starting to mirror interactions people have in gatherings of diferent types and sizes in the analog world . [ . . . ] P312 : On my team , we have meetings that are heavy on chat . Chat is particularly efective as it serializes communication , however like anything , if overused it becomes a distraction . [ . . . ] 4 IMPLICATIONS FOR BEST PRACTICES AND DESIGN 4 . 1 Guidelines for best practices The polarization around parallel chat indicates the need for all at - tendees to be more intentional in balancing utility and distraction . Further , several of our participants reported that moderators im - prove the efective use of parallel chat . We suggest the following guidelines to make parallel chat more efective . Meeting organisers , teams , and moderators should make a guideline document ( e . g . [ 22 ] ) available generally and at the beginning of meetings . Establish expectations : Share guidance on expected uses of chat before the meeting starts . For example , if a meeting features a speaker , announce their preference up front for when and how to receive questions . Because monitoring and facilitating chat imposes cognitive load , plan to rotate moderator duties across meetings and within longer meetings . Consider accessibility : Chat - related accessibility challenges in - clude processing parallel sources in multiple modalities ( e . g . with a sensory disability ) , consuming and generating text ( e . g . with read - ing disabilities ) , and understanding sentiment behind text ( e . g . with autism ) . Ensure that accessibility requests are met , for example by providing text descriptions of non - text chat content and visual con - tent in a video call ( e . g . for participants with visual impairments ) , and leaving appropriate time for participants with disabilities to respond ( e . g . if using an interpreter or screen reader ) . Encourage engagement : Encourage chat that explores diferent aspects of the meeting’s topic , for example by providing supporting links or materials , questions , or requests for clarifcations . Also encourage chat that allows more voices to be heard , such as con - tributions from people who may otherwise have difculty getting heard for many reasons , including lack of seniority / power , minority status , or disability . Moderators can encourage positive types of chat by speaking them aloud or asking their creators to voice their written content if desired . Discourage distraction : Discourage chat that diverges from the meeting’s topic , is of interest to only a small subgroup , or is inac - cessible to those requiring accommodation . Diplomatic discourage - ment may use a private backchannel to avoid public shaming , or by asking participants engaged in a divergent topic to shift to a separate channel . Loop in the speaker : Communicate non - intrusively with the cur - rent speaker to facilitate key information exchange with the au - dience . In particular , monitor the chat for questions that may be asynchronously directed to the speaker , and raise them in a fow - respecting manner . CHI ’21 Extended Abstracts , May 8 – 13 , 2021 , Yokohama , Japan A . Sarkar , S . Rintel , D . Borowiec , R . Bergmann , S . Gillet , D . Bragg , N . Baym , & A . Sellen Synthesize and disseminate : Incorporate chat highlights into meet - ing recaps . Example highlights from chat could include relevant links or topics raised that warrant further attention or discussion . 4 . 2 Implications for design Diferentiate and annotate the content of chat : Despite there being several distinct categories of chat messages , current tools do not visually distinguish them . This makes it hard for presenters and audience members to visually search text for the material most relevant to them . While manual annotation [ 35 ] is a good frst step , automated classifcation of messages could vastly reduce the cog - nitive burden by diferentiating diferent kinds of material ( both visually for sighted users , and through other mechanisms for blind and low vision users ) . For example , this would enable kudos ( e . g . positive emoji , terms like “great job” ) to be visually diferentiated from substantive comments . Questions , clarifcations , comments , kudos , on - and of - topic talk could potentially all be diferentiated . Further , automated categorisation could enable semantic zoom - ing [ 56 ] in chat , where zooming out would group posts by time , keyword , reaction , etc . , to reveal patterns and ‘hotspots’ of activity and enable efective scanning . Integrate chat with A / V : Given the problem of attending to sepa - rated A / V and chat , there are lessons to be learned from Danmaku [ 36 , 37 , 40 , 59 ] and even recent flm and television in which text and other resources form an integrated narrative . For example , non - textual activity indicators to enable presenters to see when chat is busy or quiet , intelligent placement of chat to avoid other text or attach chat to parts of the visual image , highlighting messages with posted terms that match spoken terms , and creating non - intrusive question queues that show and hide questions automatically for presenters as relevant or addressed . These features complement diferentiated chat . For example , kudos from chat could be shown on the A / V in disaggregated manner during the presentation but available aggregated afterwards . Images , documents , or websites shared into chat could be elevated to the main A / V in a seamless manner . Connect timestamped textual material : During the meeting , en - abling parallel chat , transcript , and meeting notes to be accessed side - by - side could reduce duplication and facilitate more targeted use of each . For improved contextualisation after meetings , times - tamping of chat , transcription , and notes with A / V would enable later viewers to understand the relationship between them . Moderator’s view : In line with the value of moderators , modera - tors could have access to special versions of the tools above , and more , so that they could both publicly and privately help manage the manner in which parallel chat integrates with the meeting . This could include the ability to compartmentalise chat content , remove / mute participants , hide content , etc . It could also facili - tate non - disruptive information exchange between moderator and presenter . 5 LIMITATIONS Most employees reported on experiences in Microsoft Teams . While this clearly impacts our results , and future research certainly should expand to both other companies and other platforms , the current similarity of chat features in major platforms leads us to believe that this study provides at least a strong high level overview of the phenomena . Our overview shows a range of positive and negative expectations surrounding the use of parallel chat in work meetings , but we do not have sufcient data to explain whether these difer - ent expectations were due to individual diferences or because of diferent tasks / types of collaboration . This will be a crucial step for future research . 6 CONCLUSIONS Our study has uncovered a diversity of uses and benefts of parallel chat in work video meetings . It allows for communication during a meeting , enables efective coordination around resources , acts as a record and a venue for continued discussion , enables pathways to recovery from technical issues , and makes meetings more inclusive . Parallel chat also has pitfalls . When the chat conversation diverges from the main audio - visual conversation , the chat may distract listeners and cause them to miss out on the primary content . Diver - gent chats may be missed entirely , distract and derail the primary speaker , or be seen as unprofessional . More intentional use , and especially moderation , may help guide participants to realize its value and avoid its problems . Moreover , the design of the parallel chat experience could respond to these challenges by enabling dif - ferentiated and integrated usage . As with many aspects of remote and hybrid meeting practice and design , we argue that there is a need to take a more intentional stance so that organizational pur - pose is more accountable in the tools we have to achieve it . Any design or normative solutions must recognize the dialectical nature of parallel chat as ofering both opportunities and challenges and see the goal as striking the right balances between them .
