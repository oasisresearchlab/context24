Here we present the crystal struc - ture of one such module found within human FCHo2 . This F - BAR ( extended FCH ) module consists of two F - BAR domains , forming an intrinsically curved all - helical antiparallel dimer with a K d of 2 . 5 m M . The module binds lipo - somes via a concave face , deforming them into tubules with variable diameters of up to 130 nm . Pulse EPR studies showed the membrane - bound dimer is the same as the crystal dimer , although the N - terminal helix changed confor - mation on membrane binding . Mutation of a phenylalanine on this helix partially attenuated narrow tubule formation , and resulted in a gain of curvature sensitivity . This structure shows a distant relationship to curvature - sensing BAR modules , and suggests how similar coiled - coil architectures in the BAR superfamily have evolved to expand the repertoire of mem - brane - sculpting possibilities . INTRODUCTION A necessary prerequisite for motility , communication be - tween intracellular compartments , and cell division is that cells must be able to remodel their membranes . Pro - teins that bind to membranes can aid this remodeling by imposing , stabilizing , or preferentially binding particular membrane curvatures . Furthermore , they can thereby dy - namically recruit effector functions to speciﬁc regions of the cell . An increasing number of membrane - interacting proteins have been shown to have domains / modules that inﬂuence membrane curvature ( Chitu and Stanley , 2007 ; Itoh and De Camilli , 2006 ; McMahon and Gallop , 2005 ) . Most of these proteins that have been character - ized are involved in vesicle budding and membrane traf - ﬁcking . For example , during the process of clathrin - coated vesicle formation , membrane regions of distinct curvature are created and maintained . The vesicles pro - duced are approximately 50 nm in diameter , and the necks of fully invaginated coated pits can be 20 nm or less in diameter . These curvatures are driven by a combi - nation of membrane - interacting proteins that can directly sculpt the lipid bilayer and the clathrin scaffold that indi - rectly interacts with membranes and polymerizes around nascent vesicles . In this prior class , the epsin family of pro - teins has phosphoinositol - binding ENTH domains that , upon membrane binding , insert an amphipathic helix into the bilayer ( Ford et al . , 2002 ) . This works like a wedge in the membrane and , by increasing the area of the acceptor monolayer , causes this local area of membrane to bend toward the site of insertion . Amphiphysin is another curva - ture - effecting protein that can function in clathrin - coated vesicle formation . This protein contains a BAR domain , where a dimeric module has a membrane - binding face with an intrinsic curvature , allowing it to stabilize mem - branes with this curvature ( Peter et al . , 2004 ) . An addi - tional N - terminal amphipathic helix on amphiphysin works like the amphipathic helix of ENTH domains , providing the ability to drive curvature via helix insertion . This complete module is called an N - BAR , and it has two functions , those of driving ( amphipathic helix ) and stabilizing ( BAR ) its in - trinsically preferred curvature . BAR domains are not limited to roles in clathrin - coated vesicle formation , and several structures of BAR modules have now been solved ( Gallop et al . , 2006 ; Masuda et al . , 2006 ; Peter et al . , 2004 ; Tarricone et al . , 2001 ; Weissenhorn , 2005 ) . All appear rigid and prefer a similar range of curvatures . A structural relative of the BAR module is that of the IRSp53 / missing - in - metastasis homology domain ( IMD ) dimer . IRSp53 has a role in formation of ﬁlopodia ( Millard et al . , 2005 ) . Like the BAR , the IMD is an antiparallel dimer module with each subunit folded as a three - helix bundle ( Habermann , 2004 ; Lee et al . , 2007 ; Millard et al . , 2005 ) . The IMD has a zeppelin - shape compared to the banana shape of BAR modules , and in vitro this protein can bind to membranes via a convex surface and can generate negatively curved membranes . It has thus been called an inverse BAR domain ( I - BAR ) ( Mattila et al . , 2007 ) .

We ﬁrst rec - ognized this BAR homology in pacsin / syndapin proteins ( Peter et al . , 2004 ) . Proteins with such a homology region had previously been grouped in the Saccharomyces p ombe c dc15 h omology ( PCH ) family of adaptor proteins ( Lippincott and Li , 2000 ) . The work of Aspenstro¨m ( 1997 ) ﬁrst identiﬁed that the N terminus of all these proteins con - tained an FCH ( F es and C IP4 h omology ) domain followed by a coiled - coil region . These combined regions are now called F - BAR ( FCH - BAR ) or EFC ( e xtended FC H ) domains ( Itoh et al . , 2005 ; Tsujita et al . , 2006 ) . They were ﬁrst de - scribed as adaptor proteins involved in the regulation of cytokinesis and actin dynamics ( Lippincott and Li , 2000 ) , but many are now implicated in membrane trafﬁcking and are capable of membrane binding and tubulation . This has been shown in vitro in the cases of FBP17 , CIP4 , and Pacsin1 / Syndapin1 ( Itoh et al . , 2005 ; Tsujita et al . , 2006 ) , and in vivo in the cases of Toca1 , CIP4 , PSPIP2 , and Pac - sin1 / Syndapin1 ( Itoh et al . , 2005 ; Kakimoto et al . , 2006 ; Tsujita et al . , 2006 ) . Some have C - terminal SH3 domains which bind to dynamin ( see below ) . Several family mem - bers are also known to bind to WASP / N - WASP and have involvement in cytoskeletal dynamics , placing these pro - teins on an important interface in cell biology . Mutations in PCH family proteins , or in interacting partners , are also associated with autoinﬂammatory , neurological , and neoplastic diseases ( Chitu and Stanley , 2007 ) . We set out to elucidate the structure of the F - BAR do - main , and thus set the basis for understanding its effect on membrane curvature . We solved the structure of FCHo2 F - BAR , which is a relative of the previously studied F - BAR - containing proteins listed above , and examined the mechanism by which it can deform membranes . RESULTS Crescent - Shaped F - BAR Module of FCHo2 The crystal structure of residues 3 – 274 of hFCHo2 was determined to a resolution of 2 . 3 A˚ ( Figure 1 ; Table 1 ; see Supplemental Data available with this article online ) . The overall structure appears crescent shaped witha shal - low curvature from a side view , and tilde shaped when viewed from below ( Figure 1A ) . Two monomers interact to form an antiparallel dimer ( Figure 1A , blue / green ) . Each monomer is composed of ﬁve helices . The ﬁrst and last helices ( helices 1 and 5 , respectively ) of adjacent mono - mers lie side by side ( Figure 1B ) . The longer helices 2 , 3 , and 4 form the core module , composed of a central dimer - ization region ﬂanked by ‘‘wings’’ ( Figure 1A ) . Helix 2 is the shortest of the core helices but runs the length of the dimerization interface and has a kink at a conserved gly - cine ( Figure 1C ) . Helix 3 extends the length of the mono - mer , and a kink bisecting this helix occurs on the interface of the dimerization region and the beginning of the wing structure ( Figure 1D ) . Helix 4 also runs the length of the monomer and is curved but unkinked . There is no struc - tural discontinuity between the predicted FCH region ( residues 10 – 94 ) and downstream sequences ( domain marked in Figure 1F ) , and thus this is well described as an e xtended FCH ( EFC ) domain . The core FCH region covers helix 2 and part of helix 3 , forming the central dimerization interface . The wings on each domain are more divergent , with stronger homology returning in the latter part of helix 4 , where this helix rejoins the dimeriza - tion interface ( Figure 1 ) . This dimerization region is struc - turally conserved in BAR and I - BAR proteins , suggesting that EFC domains are another selected conformation of BAR modules , where the wings are most divergent ( see below ) . For clarity , and to enable this conservation with BAR domains to be appreciated , we have chosen to use the term F - BAR for the complete domain . There are three molecules in the crystal asymmetric unit , comprising one dimer plus another subunit , which forms an identical dimer with its symmetry mate . The monomers superpose with root - mean - square deviations ( rmsd ) on C a atoms of 0 . 4 – 0 . 6 A˚ , demonstrating that the structure is essentially rigid . A hydrophobic dimerization interface covers a surface area of 4620 A˚ 2 ( Figure 2 ) . Most of the exposed hydropho - bic residues of the monomer are buried on dimerization . The long axis of the F - BAR dimer is 195 A˚ , and one surface of the dimer has a very shallow concave curvature , with an arc depth of (cid:2) 9 A˚ ( Figure 1 ) , smaller than the arc depth of (cid:2) 30 A˚ for the classical BAR modules . In this side view , the domain can hug a circle with a curvature of greater than 110 nm in diameter . The wings of the structure are twisted away from the dimerization interface , giving the antiparal - lel dimer a tilde shape ( (cid:2) ) ( see bottom panel in Figure 1A ) . The curvature of the concave face of the dimer is gener - ated mainly from the kinked helix 3 and the bent shape of helix 4 . The less - structured N - terminal helix 1 of each monomer associates with helix 5 of its dimerization part - ner , forming additional interactions with helices 2 and 4 and burying conserved hydrophobic residues including Phe10 and Trp11 ( Figure 1B ) . Helices 1 and 5 are con - served in F - BAR proteins ( Figure 1F ) . Cys273 and Cys147 from opposing monomers form a disulﬁde bond in the crystal ( Figure S6 ) , which may explain the good elec - tron density of the residues from 266 to 274 . FCHo2 F - BAR Binds to Membranes as a Dimer To probe whether the F - BAR protein is a dimer in solution as in the crystal , we truncated our construct at residue 261 to remove the C - terminal region and the cysteine residue at position 273 that could crosslink the proteins into a di - mer , if oxidized . Analytical gel ﬁltration using the truncated protein provided evidence of dimerization ( Figure 3A ) . The example absorbance trace from a column loaded with 130 m M F - BAR ( residues 1 – 261 ) showed dimer and mono - mer peaks . There was no evidence of any contaminants on Coomassie - stained gels and no evidence of any aggre - gates larger than dimers on the column ( data not shown ) . By analytical ultracentrifugation , the dimer dissociation constant was calculated to be approximately 2 . 5 m M ( Figure 3B ) , and again we did not detect any higher - order oligomers . F - BAR domains have been shown to bind to membranes ( Itoh et al . , 2005 ; Tsujita et al . , 2006 ) , and our protein bound to Folch fraction 1 liposomes in Structure F - BAR Crystallization , EPR Analysis , and Tubulation 2 Structure 15 , 1 – 14 , July 2007 ª 2007 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved Please cite this article in press as : Henne et al . , Structure and Analysis of FCHo2 F - BAR Domain : A Dimerizing and Membrane Recruitment Module that Effects Membrane Curvature , Structure ( 2007 ) , doi : 10 . 1016 / j . str . 2007 . 05 . 002 Figure 1 .

In this assay , protein that is bound to liposomes copellets with them on ultracentrifu - gation . The protein does not pellet in the absence of liposomes . Given that we used concentrations above the dimerization constant in solution , it is apparent that dimer - ization does not inhibit membrane binding as might be ex - pected if the monomer were the membrane - interacting species . In subsequent experiments , we used concentra - tions of proteins and lipids that were below half - maximal protein saturation on liposomes . To test more directly whether the dimer seen in the crys - tal could bind to membranes , we exploited the fortuitous disulﬁde bond seen in the crystal between the cysteine residues at position 147 in one monomer and 273 in the dimerization partner , and used protein from the FCHo2 3 – 274 construct , as used for the crystal structure , in a co - sedimentationassay ( Figure3D ) . Intheabsenceofareduc - ing agent , the protein ran as a dimer on SDS - PAGE ( minus b - mercaptoethanol ) . In the absence of liposomes , this dimerremainedentirelyinthesupernatantafterultracentri - fugation , but with liposomes it cosedimented . A faint monomer band was seen in the presence of liposomes due to background reducing agent used during liposome preparation . When we added dithiothreitol ( DTT ) to an identical sample , most of the disulﬁde bonds were reduced and this protein bound liposomes with a similar efﬁciency . Pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance ( EPR ) was used to test whether the dimeric structure observed in the crystal extends to the soluble and membrane - bound forms . We generated the Cys86R1 derivative of FCHo2 1 – 261 ( see Experimental Procedures ) , which can be de - tected by EPR . In the crystal dimer , the residue Cys86 is not far from Cys86 in the dimerization partner , and thus there should be detectable spin - spin interaction between these spin - labeled sites if they are found in close proxim - ity . The distance between the a carbons of these residues in the structure was (cid:2) 20 A ˚ , and assuming the commonly observed set of dihedral angles ( c 1 and c 2 in the g + / g + conformer ) ( Langen et al . , 2000 ) , a distance of around 29 A ˚ could be expected ( Figure 4A ) .

The EPR spectrum for this derivative in solution indicates a highly anisotropic motion of intermediate mobility that is consistent with its location in the X - ray crystal structure . Importantly , a very similar EPR spectrum is observed for the membrane - bound form , suggesting that membrane interaction does not cause signiﬁcant conformational changes in this re - gion . In order to obtain distance information , we employed a four - pulse double electron - electron resonance ( DEER ) experiment ( see Experimental Procedures ) . In contrast to continuous - wave EPR methods that can measure dis - tances of up to (cid:2) 20 A˚ ( Hubbell et al . , 2000 ) , this pulse EPR method extends the distance range up to 50 – 80 A˚ ( Jeschke et al . , 2002 ) . Well - deﬁned periodic oscillations are observed for the time - dependent echo intensities in solution ( Figure 4C ) and on membranes ( Figure 4E ) . From the underlying frequencies of these oscillations ( which are a direct measure of interspin distance ) , we ob - tained a distance of 29 A ˚ with a rather narrow distance dis - tribution for both the soluble and membrane - bound forms of the Cys86R1 derivative ( Figures 4D and 4F ) . This dis - tance is in agreement with the crystal structure , suggest - ing that the crystal - like dimer is likely retained in solution and on membranes . Concave Membrane - Binding Face of the F - BAR Module There are at least 25 positively charged residues on the shallow concave face of the F - BAR dimer ( Figure 5A ) . Such clustering of positively charged residues occurs on the lipid - binding concave face of amphiphysin BAR and other BAR modules ( Peter et al . , 2004 ) . However , there is also a patch of negatively charged residues in a central groove of the concave face of the F - BAR . To test whether membrane binding involved basic residues on the con - cave surface , as we found in the BAR module , we made a double lysine / arginine mutant Lys146Glu + Arg152Glu ( Figure 1F ) , thus reversing the charge of four residues on this surface of the dimer . This reduced membrane binding by approximately 40 % ( Figure 5B ) . In contrast , a Lys154 - Glu + Lys155Glu mutant ( where the mutated residues are on the convex face of the F - BAR dimer ) failed to reduce membrane binding ( Figure 5B ) . These results are similar to those from experiments in amphiphysin and endophilin , where double mutants of positively charged residues on their concave faces reduced membrane binding but did not completely abolish the interactions . In endophilin , the BAR domain begins at residue 30 , but residues N - terminal to this fold into an amphipathic helix upon membrane binding by the N - BAR module . The Figure 2 .

Given the potential amphipathic nature of the initial residues of the F - BAR domain , we asked whether they may also contribute to the membrane interaction . How - ever , in our F - BAR crystal structure ( residues 3 – 274 ) , res - idues 4 – 11 already form an a helix ( helix 1 ) that interacts with helix 5 of the adjacent monomer . As would be ex - pected , we found no evidence of any change in a helicity by circular dichroism spectroscopy upon membrane bind - ing ( data not shown ) , and thus this region is likely a consti - tutive helix . To test for a role for helix 1 in membrane bind - ing , we deleted this helix and assayed whether the protein could be more easily displaced from membranes with buffers of increasing ionic strength ( Figure 5C ) . We used two amphiphysin constructs as controls , the N - BAR module ( residues 1 – 244 ) and the BAR module ( residues 27 – 244 , missing the N - terminal amphipathic helix ) . The complete N - BAR module was not displaced by increasing salt concentration , likely due to hydrophobic insertions of residues on the amphipathic helix , but the BAR module was easily displaced , conﬁrming the ionic nature of the BAR interaction . The F - BAR module was intermediate in its displacement characteristics , and helix 1 deletion re - sulted in a mild increase in salt sensitivity , suggesting that whereas the F - BAR interaction is predominantly ionic , there may be a small contribution from hydrophobic residues . Helix 1 Is Structured in Solution and on Membranes To obtain further structure information on the N - terminal residues of F - BAR , we introduced spin labels at residues Val2 and Glu8 . Our structure starts at residue 3 , but we predicted that valine 2 should be accessible for labeling , and glutamate 8 is also exposed on helix 1 and so can also be labeled . The EPR spectra of both spin - labeled de - rivatives in solution exhibited intermediate mobility ( Figure 5D , black traces ) . Thus , in contrast to the high mo - bility observed in the case of endophilin N - terminal resi - dues ( Gallop et al . , 2006 ) , these data indicate that residues 2 and 8 are part of an ordered structure . Similarly , both sites were also part of an ordered structure upon mem - brane interaction ( Figure 5D , red traces ) . To assess whether the N terminus participates in membrane interac - tion , we recorded the accessibility of the labeled Val2R1 and Glu8R1 derivatives to O 2 and NiEDDA . Extensive pre - vious data have shown that R1 accessibility to O 2 in - creases with increasing immersion depth in the mem - brane , whereas R1 accessibility to NiEDDA decreases under those conditions . This allows the ratio of the O 2 and NiEDDA accessibilities of a given membrane - ex - posed site ( typically expressed by the contrast parameter F ) to be used as an indicator of membrane immersion depth . We found that Val2R1 , but not Glu8R1 , exhibits el - evated O 2 accessibility and reduced NiEDDA accessibility upon membrane interaction . Based upon the F value of 1 . 1 for the Val2R1 derivative , the nitroxide moiety is mem - brane inserted at a depth of approximately 3 A˚ . These data show that the N terminus is capable of interacting with the Figure 3 . The F - BAR Dimer Binds to Membranes ( A ) The F - BAR domain of FCHo2 eluted as a twin peak on analytical gel ﬁltration using aSuperdex200column ; 130 m MmFCHo2 ( res - idues 1 – 261 ) was loaded . Fraction 40 was cali - brated to 66 kDa BSA and fraction 45 was 28 kDa GST . The larger peak runs at about 60 kDa , and the smaller peak > 30 kDa , are consistent with a monomer : dimer equilibrium of a protein having a predicted monomer mass of 30 kDa . ( B ) Analytical ultracentrifugation of FCHo2 F - BAR domain showed a monomer : dimer equilibrium in solution with a K d of 2 – 8 m M . ( C ) The F - BAR domain of mFCHo2 bound lipo - somes in a saturable manner . Liposomes were made from Folch fraction 1 and extruded through a 0 . 8 m m ﬁlter . Cosedimentation with 0 . 5 mg / ml liposomes was quantiﬁed from the Coomassie - stained gel . P , pellet ; S , superna - tant . At protein concentrations above 24 m M , there was signiﬁcant nonspeciﬁc protein aggregation . ( D ) The crystal dimer of FCHo2 binds mem - branes . The crystallized F - BAR domain was concentrated in the absence of the reducing agent DTT to generate a constitutive dimer like that in the crystal from two disulﬁde bonds between Cys147 - Cys273 in the adjacent monomers ( see Figure S6 ) . This sample pelleted with 0 . 5 mg / ml 0 . 8 m m ﬁltered Folch liposomes , and ran as a dimer of (cid:2) 62 kDa on SDS - PAGE gel . The protein did not pellet in the absence of liposomes . The addition of DTT released the constitutive dimer , which still pelleted with 0 . 8 m m ﬁltered liposomes , and ran as a monomer on SDS - PAGE gel . It appears that higher concentrations of the dimer migrate slightly further on SDS - PAGE . 6 Structure 15 , 1 – 14 , July 2007 ª 2007 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved Please cite this article in press as : Henne et al . , Structure and Analysis of FCHo2 F - BAR Domain : A Dimerizing and Membrane Recruitment Module that Effects Membrane Curvature , Structure ( 2007 ) , doi : 10 . 1016 / j . str . 2007 . 05 . 002 Structure F - BAR Crystallization , EPR Analysis , and Tubulation membrane , but at least for the sites tested it is not inserted as deeply as the amphipathic helices of N - BARs . For com - parison , the hydrophobic residues of endophilin amphi - pathic helix have F values of up to 2 . 0 ( Gallop et al . , 2006 ) . The lack of deep insertion for Val2 correlates with the absence of positively charged residues ﬂanking the hydrophobic surface of the helix . Membrane Tubulation and Curvature Sensitivity BAR modules show a binding preference for highly curved membrane interfaces ( Peter et al . , 2004 ) , which is a result of the curvature of the concave face ( Gallop et al . , 2006 ; Masuda et al . , 2006 ) . In contrast , N - BAR modules bind dif - ferent - sized liposomes without preference , as they im - pose their own curvature on membranes via N - terminal helix insertion ( Gallop et al . , 2006 ; Masuda et al . , 2006 ; Pe - ter et al . , 2004 ) . As the F - BAR module also has a concave curvature , but of a distinctly different arc depth to the BARs , we examined the binding of wild - type and mutant F - BAR modules to liposomes of different sizes . Like the N - BAR , the F - BAR wild - type module bound equally to all liposome sizes tested ( Figure 5E ) . The Lys146Glu + Arg152Glu mutant on the concave face reduced lipo - some binding ( Figure 5B ) but also showed no curvature preference ( Figure 5E ) . A double Lys mutant on the convex surface did not affect binding . Deletion of helix 1 caused the F - BAR module to bind to liposomes in a curvature - sensitive manner ( data not shown ) . However , this is a se - vere mutation , causing exposure of hydrophobic residues . We therefore made a point mutation on this helix : Phe10 - Glu . This protein also showed curvature - sensitive lipo - some interactions ( Figure 5E ) . Interestingly , it bound less well to smaller liposomes ; this is the opposite curvature preference than was seen for the BAR domains of both amphiphysin and endophilin . A curvature preference of Phe10Glu for larger liposomes implies that the F - BAR module does not stabilize extreme positive curvatures , but by analogy with the N - BAR domain , the curvature in - sensitivity of the wild - type F - BAR suggests that it can im - pose its curvature on membranes . Tubulation by F - BAR domains has previously been reported for other family members ( Itoh et al . , 2005 ; Tsujita et al . , 2006 ) , and thus we tested FCHo2 F - BAR for its ability to tubulate lipo - somes by examining protein - bound liposomes by electron microscopy ( EM ) . The F - BAR domain tubulated Folch liposomes , ex - truded through a 0 . 8 m m ﬁlter , to a mixture of broad - diam - eter , cigar - like tubules ( (cid:2) 130 nm ) and more heteroge - neous but narrower tubules of 20 nm and above ( Figure 6A ) . There were relatively few broad tubules , but they were uniform in diameter , and occasionally long ver - sions of the tubules were observed ( Figure 6B ) . A visible coat could be identiﬁed ( Figure 6C ) , and some large tu - bules appeared to be in the process of being formed where elongated liposomes showed upturned rims ( see example in Figure 6D ) . These samples are negatively stained and dehydrated before microscopy , and this could explain the ﬂat appearance of some large tubules ( Figure 6C ) . With small liposomes , extruded through a 50 nm ﬁlter , we found no broad tubules , but narrower tubules were still produced ( Figure 6E ) . Individual small liposomes often had multiple sprouts of narrow tubules ( Figure 6E ) . It is clear from these micrographs that the narrower tubules were of very variable diameters along their lengths , and thus are unlikely to arise from precise packing of the F - BAR protein . We next tested the Phe10Glu mutant of helix 1 , which we have shown to be curvature sensitive , binding prefer - entially to larger liposomes ( Figure 5E ) . Notably , with Phe10Glu there was still tubulation , but we found very few examples of narrow tubules ( Figures 6F and 6G ) . Given that curvature driving and curvature sensing are op - posite ends of a continuum , it is not surprising that there are fewer narrow tubules . Changes in curvature sensitivity may therefore be a more quantitative assay for changes in tubulation efﬁcacy . To our knowledge , this is the ﬁrst re - port of narrow tubules being generated by an F - BAR mod - ule . It may well be that these narrow tubules are much Figure 4 .

We have seen examples where they have fused to each other , but they may also fragment due to their extreme curvature ( Figure 6A ) . Given the twisted shape of the F - BAR module , the di - ameter of a tubule on which this protein would comfort - ably sit in an approximately tangential manner is around 110 – 130 nm , which is close to the diameter of the large tubules seen by EM . If the F - BAR were at a more oblique angle to the axis of the tubule , then the diameter accom - modated would be narrower ( Figure 6G 0 ) . Thus , the FCHo2 F - BAR module can accommodate variable diame - ters up to approximately 130 nm . The Structurally Deﬁned F - BAR Domain Protein Family Our structure has now allowed us to accurately extend the F - BAR family , and thus we have listed the human F - BAR - containing proteins identiﬁed from our analysis ( Figure 7 ) . F - BAR domains are preferentially found at N termini of proteins but not exclusively , as GAS7 and hMHA1 have F - BAR domains at the C terminus and middle , respec - tively . There should be no structural reason why the F - BAR cannot be located at the middle or the C terminus of a protein , given that both the N and C termini of the module are likely to be free to continue without disrupting Figure 6 .

However , if the ability of helix 1 to change conformation is important for membrane binding , then this helix may well prefer to be at the N terminus . BAR domains are frequently coupled to other direct membrane recruitment modules ( such as PH or PX do - mains ) . These work synergistically to localize the proteins to membranes of speciﬁc composition and curvature ( Carlton et al . , 2004 ; Peter et al . , 2004 ) , but it is interesting to note that this synergy is not a prominent feature of F - BAR proteins . Overall , F - BAR family proteins play diverse and signiﬁcant roles as both effectors and regulators in cytoskeletal and endocytic processes in the cell through indirect and direct association with the cytoskeleton and endocytic proteins ( Table 2 ) . The BAR Superfamily The F - BAR , BAR / N - BAR , and I - BAR domains are structur - ally similar homodimeric modules with antiparallel ar - rangement of monomers ( Figure 8 ) . They all share a com - mon central core region of extended a helices , where the cores of all three domains can be overlaid with a high degree of architectural conservation ( Figure 8 , bottom panel ) . However , the ﬂanking wing regions differ . The an - gle of dimerization and conserved kinks produce these wings of varying splay . The dimerization interface of the F - BAR covers a solvent - accessible area of 4620 A˚ 2 . When the additional helices 1 and 5 ( which are less well or - dered than the central dimerization core ) are not included in the calculation , then the area buried is 2150 A˚ 2 . This is comparable to the BAR module of amphiphysin ( 2410 A˚ 2 ) and the BAR module of endophilin ( 2800 A ˚ 2 ) , and the K d s of all are in a similar range . The I - BAR module contains wings in the same plane as the a helices of its core region , producing a ﬂat zeppelin - or lens - like structure . In the F - BAR module , a kink in helix 3 and a bend in helix 4 gener - ate a shallow concave face that is of intermediate splay compared with BAR and I - BAR modules . The same heli - ces have kinks in the BAR module , and extra curvature is achieved by having a less antiparallel dimerization inter - face ( Figure 8 ) . BAR modules from at least three different protein fami - lies have been solved , and they can all be overlaid with a high degree of architectural conservation . The central di - merization cores are almost identical , but the wings are slightly contorted with respect to each other . The same will likely be true for F - BAR modules . An overlay of cross - sections through the axis of symmetry of each of the three domains shows that the different helices are in approximately the same position ( Figure 8 ) . Taken to - gether , our data suggest that the F - BAR module is indeed a member of a larger BAR superfamily . DISCUSSION Unlike the previously studied F - BAR - containing proteins , FCHo1 and 2 ( FCH domain only 1 and 2 ) , as the names suggest , contain no C - terminal SH3 domain nor any other known domains . The central and C - terminal regions are predicted to be largely disordered , but the last 300 amino acids are conserved across species and homologous to a region in endophilin interacting protein - 1 . Homologs of FCHo2 exist among mammalian , Drosophila , and Caeno - rhabditis elegans genomes , and human FCHo2 has been characterized in situ as a 26 - exon gene on chromosome position 5q13 . 2 ( Katoh and Katoh , 2004 ) . The F - BAR module of FCHo2 is a dimeric membrane - binding curvature effector . Its interaction with membranes was found to be largely ionic and via a shallow concave face . It deformed liposomes into a range of tubule diame - ters from 20 to 130 nm , where variable diameters may be achieved by orientating the F - BAR module at various ob - lique angles relative to the tubule axis . As in the case of amphiphysin ( Peter et al . , 2004 ) , the curvature preference is obscured in the wild - type protein , because tight binding allows the protein to deform liposomes to match their pref - erence . Mutation of the N - terminal helix ( Phe10Glu Figure 7 .

These different preferences correspond to the approxi - mate curvatures accommodated by the concave face of the modules . The dimeric nature of the F - BAR architecture means that other domains within F - BAR - containing proteins are presented as pairs on a membrane surface , and this may well increase their avidity for ligands , making these effective recruitment proteins . Curvatures induced by var - ious BAR modules represent the most extreme positively curved membranes observed in vivo . Having another module , the F - BAR , that can induce or accommodate a less extreme positive curvature broadens the repertoire of membrane - sculpting possibilities . It may also point to the existence of other modules with yet different curvature preferences . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Protein Expression and Puriﬁcation Human ( hFCHo2 , residues 3 – 274 ) and mouse ( mFCHo2 , residues 1 – 261 ) constructs were cloned into pGEX - 6P1 and transformed into Escherichia coli Rosetta or BL21 pLysS strains . Protein was harvested following overnight induction with 50 m M IPTG at 25 (cid:3) C . GST - tagged protein was puriﬁed from the bacterial lysate using GSH Sepharose beads ( GE Healthcare ) . The beads were washed with HN buffer ( 150 mM NaCl , 20 mM HEPES [ pH 7 . 5 ] , 2 . 5 mM DTT ) , and the GST tag was cleaved off overnight with PreScission protease ( GE Healthcare ) . Protein was further puriﬁed on a Superdex 200 gel - ﬁltration column ( GE Healthcare ) and concentrated . Protein Crystal Optimization , Data Collection , Phasing , Reﬁnement , and Model Building hFCHo2 protein was concentrated to a minimum of 5 mg / ml . Crystals were obtained using sitting drop vapor diffusion against a reservoir containing 18 % PEG 4000 , 300 mM sodium acetate , and 100 mM Tris ( pH 9 ) at room temperature . Crystals appeared after 24 hr and grew to typical dimensions of approximately 0 . 4 3 0 . 2 3 0 . 2 mm . Forcryocooling , crystalsweretransferredstepwiseintothecrystalliza - tion condition supplemented with up to 24 % glycerol . Derivative crys - tals were generated by soaking the crystals in mother liquor supple - mented with 1 mM ethyl mercury thiosalicylate ( EMTS ) for variable lengths of time ranging from 30 min to several days . Native and derivative data were collected at ID14 - 4 and ID29 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility inGrenoble , France . Crystals belonged to space group C2 with cell dimensions a = 254 . 4 A˚ , b = 65 . 7A˚ , c = 89 . 9A˚ , b = 110 . 3 (cid:3) andhadthreemoleculesintheasymmetric unit , forming one and a half dimers ( i . e . , with one dimer related by the crystallographic dyad ) . The intensities were markedly anisotropic : na - tive data extended to 2 . 3 A˚ along a * but not much beyond 2 . 8 A˚ in the other directions ( eigenvalues of the anisotropic distribution of j F j = 0 . 35 , 0 . 65 , 1 . 0 ) . The two derivative data sets were each somewhat in - complete ( see Table 1 ) , but together they covered nearly all reﬂections to 3 . 1 A˚ resolution . Reﬂections were integrated with MOSFLM ( Leslie , 2006 ) and scaled with SCALA ( Evans , 2006 ) from the CCP4 suite of crystallographic software ( CCP4 , 1994 ) .

Following solvent ﬂattening using SOLOMON ( Abrahams , 1997 ) with 60 % sol - vent , the experimentalmap was clearly traceable . The model was built using O ( Jones et al . , 1991 ) and Coot ( Emsley and Cowtan , 2004 ) and was reﬁned using REFMAC5 ( Murshudov et al . , 1997 ) . Liposome Preparation and Cosedimentation Spin Assays Folch fraction 1 liposomes ( Sigma ) were mixed in a 3 : 1 ratio of meth - anol : chloroform and evaporated in a glass tube with a gas stream of argon . After vacuum desiccation to ensure the complete removal of solvent , liposomes were hydrated in HN buffer to a concentration of 1mg / ml . They were then sequentially passed through Nuclepore poly - carbonate ﬁlters ( Whatman ) by syringe extrusion through the following ﬁlters : 0 . 8 , 0 . 2 , 0 . 1 , and 0 . 05 m m . In cosedimentation assays , protein was added to 0 . 5 mg / ml ( ﬁnal concentration ) liposomes in HN buffer for 30 min at room temperature in Beckman7 3 20 mm polycarbonate tubes and spun down in an Optima TL desktop ultracentrifuge .

Experiments testing for curvature sensitivity used Dab2 PTB domain ( curvature - insensitive lipid - binding domain ) to control for the amount of available liposome ( data not shown ) .

Equilibrium Ultracentrifugation Please see Supplemental Data . Spin Labeling and EPR Spectroscopy N - terminal single - cysteine mutants , Val2Cys and Glu8Cys , were gen - erated in an otherwise cysteine - free background , in which the native cysteines ( Cys147 and Cys86 ) were replaced with serines . The Cys86single - cysteinemutantwasmadebyreplacingCys147withser - ine . Puriﬁed single - cysteine mutants in HN buffer were subjected to size - exclusion chromatography ( PD - 10 column ; Amersham Biosci - ences ) in buffer to remove DTT . Immediately following DTT removal , proteinswerelabeledwitha10 - foldmolarexcessofanMTSLnitroxide spin label ( [ 1 - oxyl - 2 , 2 , 5 , 5 - tetramethylpyrroline - 3 - methyl ] - methane - thiosulfonate ) to generate the new side chain R1 . After 1 hr incubation , unreacted label was removed by size - exclusion chromatography ( PD - 10 column ; Amersham Biosciences ) . EPR spectra at room temperature were recorded using X - band Bruker EMX spectrometers that were ﬁtted with a Bruker ER4119HS resonator ( 12 . 7 mW power ) . The scan width for the magnetic ﬁeld was 150 Gauss . Membrane - bound samples were generated by incu - bating 30 m g of protein with 700 m g of extruded 400 nm Folch lipo - somes in a total volume of 1 . 5 ml . For all samples , membrane interac - tion was veriﬁed by a copelleting assay . Whereas no pelleting was observed at 210 , 000 3 g in the absence of membranes , nearly quan - titative pelleting occurred in the presence of liposomes . The same co - pelleting method was also used as a means of concentrating mem - brane - bound F - BAR for EPR analysis ( ﬁnal volume 10 – 20 m l ) . Accessibility to oxygen ( from air ; P [ O 2 ] ) or 10 mM NiEDDA ( P [ NiEDDA ] ) was determined by power saturation using a Bruker ER4123D dielectric resonator . The contrast parameter F is deﬁned as F = ln [ P ( O 2 ) / P ( NiEDDA ) ] . Through calibration with 1 - palmitoyl - 2 - stearoyl - ( n - DOXYL ) - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine ( Avanti Polar Lipids ) , F can be converted into immersion depth ( Altenbach et al . , 1994 ) . Using this approach , we previously obtained the following rela - tionship between immersion depth ( d ) and F for tubulated Folch mem - branes : d [ A˚ ] = 6 . 3 * F (cid:4) 3 . 9 ( Gallopetal . , 2006 ) . Weveriﬁedthatthiscal - ibration was also applicable to the tubulated Folch membranes generated by the F - BAR protein . Long - rangedistanceswereobtainedfromfour - pulseDEER ( Pannier et al . , 2000 ) experiments that were performed on a Bruker Elexsys E 580 X - band pulsed EPR instrument ﬁtted with a 3 mm split - ring ( MS - 3 ) resonator . The DEER experiment measures how the refocused echo of a given spin population is affected by dipolar interactions with other spins . Thisdipolar interactiongivesrisetoperiodicoscillationsin the spin echo intensity and their frequencies are a direct measure of interspin distance . Samples ( (cid:2) 20 m l ) were ﬂash - frozen in the presence of either 30 % glycerol or 30 % sucrose and data were acquired at 78K . Identicaldistanceswereobtained inthepresenceofthedifferentcryo - protectants . Theobserverpulselengths forthe P / 2and P pulseswere 16 and 32 ns , respectively . The observe frequency was set to the maximum of the low - ﬁeld absorption peak , while the ELDOR pump frequency was set to the maximum of the central absorption peak . Measurementswererepeatedwitharepetitionrateof500Hz . Thetotal acquisition time ranged from 5 to 12 hr . Distance information from the dipolar time evolution data was generated using the DEERAnalysis 2006 package ( freely available at http : / / www . mpip - mainz . mpg . de / (cid:2) jeschke / distance . html ) ( Jeschke , 2002 ) . Similar results were also obtained using DEFit , which was kindly provided by Dr . Peter G . Fajer ( Florida State University ) . The background contribution from nonspe - ciﬁc protein - protein contacts was subtracted using a three - dimen - sional model for soluble F - BAR and a two - dimensional ( planar ) model formembrane - boundF - BAR ( Hilger etal . , 2005 ) . Distanceswere ﬁtted to a Gaussian distance distribution . Negative - Stain Electron Microscopy Sample protein was coincubated for 10 min with Folch fraction 1 lipo - somes and placed on glow discharged carbon - coated copper grids ( CANEMCO - MARIVAC ) for (cid:2) 60 s . The grids were subsequently washed in buffer , then in water , and then stained with 2 % uranyl ace - tate for 60 s . Grids were then dried and observed with a Phillips trans - mission electron microscope .
