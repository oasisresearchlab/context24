Wsp1 - VCA binds both Arp2 / 3 complex and actin monomers with high affinity . These two ligands have only modest impacts on the interactionoftheotherligandwithVCA . Simulationsofamath - ematical model based on the kinetic parameters determined in this study and elsewhere account for the full time course of actin polymerization in the presence of Arp2 / 3 complex and Wsp1 - VCAandshowthatanactivationstep , postulatedtofollowbind - ing of a ternary complex of Arp2 / 3 complex , a bound nucle - ation - promoting factor , and an actin monomer to an actin filament , hasarateconstantatleast0 . 15s (cid:1) 1 . Kineticparameters determined in this study constrain the process of actin filament branch formation during cellular motility to one main pathway . Arp ( actin - related protein ) 3 2 / 3 complex nucleates actin fil - aments as branches on pre - existing actin filaments so that growth of these filaments can transmit force for cellular motil - ity through the cytoskeleton to the substrate ( 1 ) . Extensive structural and biochemical data established that Arp2 / 3 com - plex is intrinsically inactive , so nucleation depends on interac - tions with proteins called nucleation - promoting factors ( 2 ) , actin monomers , and actin filaments . Four reactants create many possible pathways to the birth of a daughter filament on the side of a mother filament ( see Fig . 1 ) . The only way to iden - tify the favored pathway is to measure the rates of all of the reactions and the concentrations of each of the reactants . An initial study by Marchand et al . showed that the VCA ( verprolin homology , central , and acidic ) region of the nucle - ation - promoting factor WASp ( Wiskott - Aldrich - syndrome protein ) interacts with both actin monomers and Arp2 / 3 com - plex in rapid equilibria ( 3 ) . The verprolin homology and central region of these nucleation - promoting factors binds actin monomers , and the CA region binds Arp2 / 3 complex . Thus the C region binds both actin and Arp2 / 3 complex but not simul - taneously ( 4 ) . The dissociation equilibrium constant for human WASp - VCA binding actin monomers is 0 . 6 (cid:1) M , and the rate of exchange at equilibrium ( k (cid:1) ) is 3 s (cid:1) 1 . WASp - VCA binds bovine Arp2 / 3 complex with a K d of 0 . 9 (cid:1) M and k (cid:1) of 0 . 2 s (cid:1) 1 . Because a mutation in human WASp - VCA from a patient with Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome did not alter its affinity for actin monomers or Arp2 / 3 complex but decreased the number of actin filament barbed ends formed in bulk samples , Marchand et al . proposed a rate - limiting activation step , after a ternary complex consist - ing of Arp2 / 3 complex , VCA , and an actin monomer binds a mother filament and before the branch starts to grow . In the absence of a full set of rate constants , the possible pathways from reactants to branches were not well constrained . In particular nothing was known about the rates of which Arp2 / 3 complex binds and dissociates on the sides of mother filaments . To define the pathway more rigorously , we sought new spectroscopic assays to measure the rates of interactions between Arp2 / 3 complex , nucleation - promoting factors , actin monomers , and actin filaments . Ideally , the signal from an assay to measure the interaction between any two of the reactants will be insensitive to the presence of other binding partners , so that any perturbation of the reaction by other binding partners can be determined . Fig . 1 shows a detailed kinetic mechanism for the formation of actin filament branches to provide a guide to the reactions that we studied . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Purification of S . pombe Arp2 / 3 Complex —Native Arp2 / 3 complex was purified from protease - deficient TM011 strain of Schizosaccharomyces pombe . Cells were suspended in 1 ml of buffer U ( 50 m M HEPES , 100 m M KCl , 3 m M MgCl 2 , 1 m M EGTA , and 1 m M DTT , pH 7 . 5 ) per gram of wet cell pellet and stored at (cid:1) 80 °C . All subsequent steps were carried out at 0 – 4 °C . Complete protease inhibitor tablets ( Roche Applied Science , 1 tablet per 50 ml ) were added to thawed cell pellets , and cells were lysed by mechanical disruption in a Microfluid - izer ( model M - 110S , Microfluidics ) . Lysates were centrifuged at 20 , 000 (cid:2) g for 20 min , and the supernatant was centrifuged again at 100 , 000 (cid:2) g for 1 h . Proteins in the supernatant were precipitated with 40 % ammonium sulfate , resuspended in buffer PKME ( 10 m M PIPES , 50 m M KCl , 3 m M MgCl 2 , 1 m M * This work was supported by National Institutes of Health Grant GM - 26338 ( to T .

The dialyzed sample was clarified by centrifugation at 150 , 000 (cid:2) g for 1 h before being applied to a column of 15 mg of GST - N - WASp - VCA immobilized on 2 ml of glutathione - Sepharose . The column was washed with 30 ml of PKME , 20 ml of PKME - 150 ( 10 m M PIPES , 150 m M KCl , 3 m M MgCl 2 , 1 m M EGTA , 0 . 1 m M ATP , 1 m M DTT , pH 6 . 5 ) , eluted with buffer Q ( 10 m M PIPES , pH 6 . 8 , 25 m M NaCl , 0 . 25 m M MgCl 2 , 0 . 25 m M EGTA , 1 m M DTT ) containing 1 M NaCl and then dialyzed against buffer Q for at least 2 h . Arp2 / 3 complex was further purified by ion - exchange chromatography on a 1 - ml column of Mono Q ( AKTA FPLC , GE Healthcare ) . DTT was omitted from FPLC buffers , if the protein was to be labeled with a fluorescent dye . A typical yield was 1 . 2 mg from 50 grams of cells . Labeling Arp2 / 3 Complex —Arp2 / 3 complex for fluorescent labeling was immediately pooled from the Mono Q fractions and concentrated to at least 1 mg / ml using an Amicon ultra - 4 , 50 , 000 MWCO ( Millipore ) . Concentrated fractions were reacted with a 20 - fold molar excess of N - ( 1 - pyrenyl ) iodoacet - amide or Oregon Green 488 iodoacetamide on ice in the dark for up to 2 h . The reaction was quenched by addition of 10 m M DTT , centrifuged at 16 , 000 (cid:2) g for 15 min at 4 °C to remove insoluble dye and dialyzed against KMEI ( 10 m M imidazole , pH 7 . 0 , 50 m M KCl , 1 m M MgCl 2 , 1 m M EGTA ) with 0 . 1 m M ATP and 1 m M DTT overnight before use . Purification and Labeling of Other Proteins —Skeletal muscle actin ( 5 ) , pyrene - labeled actin ( 6 ) , GST fusion of Wsp1 VCA ( 7 ) , rhodamine - VCA ( 3 ) , and capping protein ( 8 ) were purified and labeled with fluorescent dyes . Fission Yeast Mutagenesis —Mutations were created by intro - ducing nucleotide changes into the forward integration primer for fission yeast transformations using the pFA6a vector ( 9 ) . Isolating the non - parental ditype in tetrad analysis identified the double mutant strain . Mass Spectrometry —Purified S . pombe Arp2 / 3 complex was incubated with a 20 - fold molar excess of Oregon - Green 488 iodoacetamide for 2 h on ice . Labeled and unlabeled samples were analyzed by SDS - PAGE . The fluorescence band ( Fig . 2 B ) and corresponding band on the unlabeled control were cut from the gel and subjected to in - gel trypsin digest . Analysis of peptide masses by matrix - assisted laser desorption ionization time - of - flight mass spectroscopy by the Yates laboratory at Scripps Research Institute revealed a single peptide differing by 550 atomic mass units between the two samples . Theoretical trypsin digest maps of ARPC3 and ARPC4 identified the pep - tide as the C - terminal peptide of ARPC4 , containing a single cysteine , residue 167 . Pyrene Arp2 / 3 Complex Binding Assays —For equilibrium binding assays involving actin filaments , actin was polymerized for 1 h at room temperature before adding 50 n M pyrene - la - beled Arp2 / 3 complex and incubating for an additional 2 h . Pyrene fluorescence was measured with an Alphascan fluorom - eter ( Photon Technology International ) with excitation at 365 nm and emission at 390 nm . The average counts per second for a 10 - s scan are reported . For kinetic experiments , actin fila - ments were polymerized for 10 – 20 min before mixing by hand with 50 n M pyrene Arp2 / 3 complex and starting time courses . Fluorescence emission was measured for 1 s at 5 - s intervals . Time courses were fit to single or double exponentials to yield observed rate constants . Fluorescence Anisotropy —Anisotropy measurements were made with an Alphascan fluorometer in a T - format . Fixed con - centrations of rhodamine - VCA or VCA - rhodamine were mixed with actin or Arp2 / 3 complex and incubated for at least 30 min in KMEI or buffer G . Samples were excited with polar - ized light at 552 nm , and polarized emitted light was measured at 574 nm with 0 . 1 point / s for 30 s . The average anisotropy was calculated using PTI Felix software . FRET Measurements —FRET measurements were made with an Alphascan fluorometer . For steady - state measurements a fixed concentration of actin labeled on Cys - 374 with Oregon Green 488 ( Oregon Green actin ) was mixed with a range of concentrations of rhodamine - VCA in the presence or absence of 1 . 5 (cid:1) M Arp2 / 3 complex in KMEI and incubated for at least 30 min at room temperature . Emission scans from 510 to 610 nm were made using an excitation wavelength of 470 nm . Percent donor fluorescence quenched was calculated by comparing the average fluorescence from 519 to 524 nm with OG - actin alone . Kinetic experiments were performed using a MiniMixer stopped - flow apparatus ( KinTek ) . The samples were excited at 470 nm , and emission was measured at 519 nm with a 3 - nm slit width on the Alphascan monochromator . Time courses were fit to single exponentials to yield observed rate constants . Determination of Equilibrium and Kinetic Constants —Equi - librium dissociation constants ( K d ) were calculated by fitting Equation 1 to the ligand concentration dependence of the signal ( S ) for pyrene fluorescence , anisotropy , or fraction donor fluo - rescence quenched , S (cid:2) S f (cid:3) (cid:3) S b (cid:4) S f (cid:4)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:5) R (cid:6) (cid:3) (cid:5) L (cid:6) (cid:3) K d (cid:4) (cid:4) (cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:5) R (cid:6) (cid:3) (cid:5) L (cid:6) (cid:3) K d (cid:4) ∧ 2 (cid:4) 4 * (cid:5) R (cid:6) * (cid:5) L (cid:6)(cid:4) ∧ 0 . 5 (cid:4) / 2 * (cid:5) L (cid:6) ( Eq . 1 ) where S f is the signal of the free receptor ( R ) , S b is the signal of the bound receptor , and [ L ] is the concentration of the ligand ( species on the x - axis ) . S b and K d were left as parameters to be fit . For Fig . 4 D , S f was also left as a parameter to be fit . We calculated the association ( k (cid:7) ) and dissociation ( k (cid:1) ) rate constants by fitting Equation 2 to the observed rate constants ( k obs ) , k obs (cid:2) k (cid:7) (cid:5) L (cid:6) (cid:3) k (cid:1) ( Eq . 2 ) where [ L ] is the total concentration of ligand ( species on the x - axis ) . Actin Filament Assembly Assays —Assembly of actin was measured with an Alphascan fluorometer from the fluores - cence of pyrene - labeled actin ( 10 ) with 4 (cid:1) M actin monomers ( 5 % pyrene - labeled ) , 1 (cid:1) M rhodamine - VCA , and a range of con - centrations of fission yeast Arp2 / 3 complex . Fluorescence read - ings were converted to actin filament concentrations by nor - malizing the starting signal to 0 (cid:1) M actin filaments and the average plateau value to 3 . 84 (cid:1) M . Simulations of Actin Filament Assembly —Models were built , and simulations were run using Vcell 4 . 2 from National Resource for Cell Analysis and Modeling ( NRCAM , www . vcell .

Chemical species present and reactions are defined in Figs . 1 A and 5 C . Rate constants are reported in Tables 1 and 2 . The LSODA integrator was used , and residuals were calculated using an output interval of 5 s to match the data acquisition rate of the actin assembly assays . RESULTS Creation of Fluorescent Derivatives of S . pombe Arp2 / 3 Complex —Cysteine 167 of ARPC4 is the only reactive cysteine in S . pombe Arp2 / 3 complex , but it is not a good site to attach a fluorescent dye for biochemical experiments , because it inter - feres with Arp2 / 3 complex function ( see supplemental text ) . Reaction of purified S . pombe Arp2 / 3 complex with Oregon Green 488 iodoacetamide resulted in dye incorporation into only the ARPC4 subunit ( Fig . 2 , A and B ) . Analysis of tryptic peptides by mass spectroscopy identified a single peptide of ARPC4 containing cysteine 167 that differed by (cid:8) 550 atomic mass units between labeled and unlabeled samples . The other 22 cysteines in the complex did not react with Oregon Green 488 iodoacetamide . Mutation of ARPC4 cysteine167 to serine resulted in the loss of Oregon Green 488 incorporation into Arp2 / 3 complex with - out altering its biochemical activity in actin filament nucleation assays ( data not shown ) . Fission yeast expressing this mutation had no noticeable growth or morphology defects . Therefore the C167S mutation in ARPC4 provided a suitable background for creating new labeling sites . To develop a spectroscopic assay for interactions between Arp2 / 3 complex and actin filaments , we used our phylogenetic analysis of Arp2 / 3 complex ( 12 ) and existing biochemical evi - dence to pick a labeling site that might be close to the mother filament in branches . We chose to mutate the genome to replace a solvent - exposed , unconserved alanine ( 317 ) at the C terminus of ARPC2 with cysteine . We crossed the ARPC2 A317C strain with the strain containing the ARPC4 C167S mutation . The double mutant had normal growth and mor - phology under the conditions tested . Reaction of Oregon Green 488 iodoacetamide with purified Arp2 / 3 complex from the double mutant ( ARPC4 - C167S / ARPC2 - A317C ) consistently labeled the ARPC2 subunit ( Fig . 2 B ) . The reaction went to completion in 2 h ( data not shown ) . Oregon Green 488 occasionally labeled the band containing Arp2 and ARPC1 ( Fig . 2 B ) .

However , pyrene - labeled Arp2 / 3 com - plex contributes to the overall pyrene fluorescence , so we did not attempt a quantitative analysis of actin assembly with this assay . Interaction of Arp2 / 3 Complex with Actin Filaments —Titra - tion of pyrene - labeled Arp2 / 3 complex with unlabeled chicken skeletal muscle actin filaments gave a concentration - dependent increase in fluorescence up to (cid:8) 5 - fold ( Fig . 2 C ) . Fitting a bind - ing isotherm to this data yielded a dissociation equilibrium con - stant of 4 . 6 (cid:9) 0 . 5 (cid:1) M ( Fig . 2 D ) , similar to the affinity of Acan - thamoeba Arp2 / 3 complex for actin filaments measured with cosedimentation assays ( 11 ) . The extent of fluorescence enhancement was not affected by the presence of capping pro - tein or by extensive shearing of the actin filaments ( data not shown ) , treatments that increase the number of filament ends . The fluorescence enhancement being sensitive to the concen - tration of polymerized actin , but not the number of filament ends , suggests that the fluorescence enhancement is due to Arp2 / 3 complex binding to the sides of actin filaments rather than barbed or pointed ends . The fluorescence of pyrene - labeled Arp2 / 3 complex increased very slowly following the addition of actin filaments ( Fig . 2 E ) . A single exponential with a rate constant on the order of 10 (cid:1) 3 s (cid:1) 1 fit the time course of the fluorescence change . We measured the time courses of the fluorescence change over a range of actin filament concentrations and plotted k obs versus actin filament concentration ( Fig . 2 F ) . The plot was linear with FIGURE 2 . Development of pyrene - labeled S . pombe Arp2 / 3 complex and its interaction with actin filaments .

The ratio of these rate constants ( K d (cid:10) k (cid:1) / k (cid:7) (cid:10) 6 . 7 (cid:1) M ) confirmed the equilibrium measurements of the affinity . The time course of binding did not differ significantly for actin filaments poly - merized for 6 min ( a mixture of ATP - , ADP - P i , and ADP - actin ) and 45 min ( mostly ADP - actin ) ( data not shown ) . The presence of a saturating concentration , 3 (cid:1) M , of the nucleation - promot - ing factor S . pombe Wsp1 VCA fused to GST did not alter the association rate constant , but increased the dissociation rate constant to 3 . 4 (cid:2) 10 (cid:1) 3 s (cid:1) 1 ( Fig . 2 F ) . Fluorescence Anisotropy Assays for Binding of a Nucleation - promoting Factor to Arp2 / 3 Complex or Actin Monomers —We used fluorescence anisotropy ( 3 ) to measure interactions between S . pombe Wsp1 VCA labeled on an N - terminal cys - teine residue with tetramethylrhodamine iodoacetamide ( rho - damine - VCA ) and chicken skeletal muscle actin monomers or S . pombe Arp2 / 3 complex ( Fig . 3 ) . Titration of a low concentra - tion of rhodamine - VCA with unlabeled actin monomers ( Fig . 3 A ) or unlabeled Arp2 / 3 complex ( Fig . 3 B ) both gave binding isotherms with K d s of 16 n M . The anisotropy of rhodamine - VCA does not have a favorable signal - to - noise ratio to measure interactions of the complex of VCA and an actin monomer with Arp2 / 3 complex , so we used S . pombe Wsp1 VCA labeled on the C terminus ( VCA - rhoda - mine ) . The fluorescent dye on the C terminus is far from the actin binding site , allowing the flexible VCA - rhodamine pep - tide to retain considerable rotational diffusion even when bound to an actin monomer . The rotational diffusion decreases when the C - terminal A region of VCA binds Arp2 / 3 complex , giving a favorable anisotropy change . VCA - rhodamine bound Arp2 / 3 complex with a K d of 130 n M by itself and a K d of 310 n M in the presence of 3 (cid:1) M actin monomers in a low ionic strength buffer ( G - buffer , Fig . 3 C ) . In a physiological strength buffer ( KMEI ) , VCA - rhodamine bound Arp2 / 3 complex with a K d of 180 n M by itself and a K d of 100 n M in the presence of 3 (cid:1) M Latrunculin - A ( Lat - A ) actin ( Fig . 3 D ) . Therefore actin bound to VCA has only a small effect on the affinity of VCA for Arp2 / 3 complex , a 2 - fold negative effect at low ionic strength , and a 2 - fold positive effect with Lat - A actin at physiological ionic strength . FRET Assay for Binding of a Nucleation - promoting Factor to Actin Monomers —We developed an assay based on FRET to measure interactions between nucleation - promoting factors and actin monomers without interference by Arp2 / 3 complex . Actin monomers labeled with Oregon - Green 488 on Cys - 374 served as the “donor” and VCA containing an N - terminal cys - teine labeled with tetramethylrhodamine ( rhodamine - VCA ) served as the “acceptor . ” Equilibrium binding experiments showed that a saturating concentration of acceptor quenches the donor fluorescence by (cid:8) 80 % ( Fig . 4 , A and B ) . From the concentration dependence of the FRET signal we measured the affinity of rhodamine - VCA for Oregon Green actin monomers . The dissociation equilibrium constant was 15 n M in the absence and 29 n M in the presence of 1 . 5 (cid:1) M Arp2 / 3 complex ( Fig . 4 B ) . We used competition experiments with unlabeled actin monomers to determine the dissociation rate of Oregon Green actin from rhodamine - VCA in the presence and absence of S . pombe Arp2 / 3 complex . In both experiments the rate of flu - orescence increase due to the loss of FRET was 0 . 44 s (cid:1) 1 ( Fig . 4 C ) . From the K d and k (cid:1) measured in these experiments we calculate the k (cid:7) for rhodamine - VCA binding an actin mon - omer to be 29 . 3 (cid:1) M (cid:1) 1 s (cid:1) 1 when rhodamine - VCA is free in solution and 15 . 2 (cid:1) M (cid:1) 1 s (cid:1) 1 when rhodamine - VCA is bound to Arp2 / 3 complex . Estimation of the Activation Rate Constant by Mathematical Modeling —With our measurement of the kinetics of Arp2 / 3 complex interactions with actin filaments , we felt we had enough information to develop a mathematical model of actin assembly under standard in vitro conditions . Primarily , we wanted to measure the rate of an activation step , which was postulated to occur after the ternary complex of actin mono - mer , VCA , and Arp2 / 3 complex binds to the side of a mother filament and before the daughter filament starts to grow ( 3 ) . This activation step was proposed to explain how a mutation in WASp VCA might reduce the rate of branch formation with FIGURE 3 .

To estimate the activation rate constant we collected the full time course of actin assembly over a range of Arp2 / 3 complex concentrations ( 0 – 100 n M ) ( Fig . 5 A ) . The assay contained 4 (cid:1) M actin ( 5 % pyrene - labeled ) and a saturating concentration of rhodamine - VCA ( 1 (cid:1) M ) . We used Virtual Cell software to sim - ulate the time course of polymerization , using the reaction parameters in Table 1 . Fig . 5 C shows a graphical depiction of the reaction pathway . We varied the value of the activation rate constant until the simulations matched the experimental data for the full range of concentrations of Arp2 / 3 complex . With activation rate con - stants (cid:11) 0 . 1 s (cid:1) 1 the simulations were slower than the experi - mental observations . An activation rate constant of 0 . 15 s (cid:1) 1 gave simulated time courses that matched the observations . Activation rate constants (cid:12) 0 . 15 s (cid:1) 1 accelerated the simulated time course of polymerization only modestly beyond the exper - imental observations . For example , with an activation rate con - stant of 0 . 15 s (cid:1) 1 and 50 n M Arp2 / 3 complex the simulated time course reached 80 % completion in 318 s ( similar to the experi - mental time of 324 s ) , whereas simulations with activation rate constants of 1 . 5 s (cid:1) 1 to 5 s (cid:1) 1 reached this point in 300 s . This analysis puts a lower limit of 0 . 15 s (cid:1) 1 on the activation rate constant . The simulations deviated systematically to a small extent from the experimental data ( Fig . 5 B ) . The residuals shared a non - random sinusoidal appearance , even for actin alone , because we used a simplified model of actin filament nucleation to allow us to focus on the reactions involved in branch forma - tion . This simplification contributed most of the error but is unlikely to have a significant impact on the overall analysis . With kinetic data on more of the interactions among Arp2 / 3 complex , VCA , actin monomers , and actin filaments , we sought to determine the predominant pathway of actin filament branch formation during cellular motility . For this simulation we used established rate constants for interactions between human WASp VCA and bovine Arp2 / 3 complex and skeletal muscle actin ( 3 ) along with rate constants for interactions of Arp2 / 3 complex and actin filaments , and activation of Arp2 / 3 complex from this study ( Table 2 ) . Marchand et al . determined equilibrium binding constants and dissociation rates for rhoda - mine - VCA and equilibrium binding values for unlabeled VCA . We wanted to use the rate constants for unlabeled VCA , so we adjusted the k (cid:1) to correct for the effect of rhodamine on bind - ing affinity . We also decreased by 2 - fold the k (cid:7) for actin mon - omer binding to VCA in the presence of Arp2 / 3 complex ( reac - tions 5 , 6 , 8 , and 10 ) based on our FRET results ( Fig . 4 , B and C ) . Marchand et al . determined that the presence of 5 (cid:1) M actin filaments increased the affinity of human WASp VCA for bovine Arp2 / 3 complex 5 - fold but did not determine if this was due to a decrease in the k (cid:1) or an increase in the k (cid:7) ( Table 2 ) . We included this observation in our model by decreasing the k (cid:1) of reactions 4 , 5 , and 9 by 5 - fold . With these adjustments , the free energy change is equivalent along each pathway to form an actin filament branch . We used estimated cellular concentra - tions of reactants found at the leading edge of motile cell types : 10 (cid:1) M actin monomers ( 13 ) , 200 n M activated nucleation - pro - moting factor ( VCA ) ( our estimate ) , 5 (cid:1) M Arp2 / 3 complex ( 10 ) , and 1000 (cid:1) M polymerized actin ( 14 ) . The concentrations were held constant to mimic steady - state motility where recycling mechanisms actively turn over cytoskeletal components . We did not take into account the presence of profilin , which com - petes with VCA for binding actin monomers ( 10 , 15 , 16 ) , because these reactions have not yet been fully characterized . Fig . 1 B lists the steady - state rates of the reactions . The slow - est reaction ( 4 ) is 0 . 085 (cid:1) M / s , and the fastest ( reaction 7 ) is 1 . 3 (cid:1) M / s among reactions of the competing pathways ( reactions 1 – 10 ) . At steady state the process produced 2 . 1 (cid:1) M actin fila - ment branches per second . Each of these barbed ends would grow at 116 subunits per second . Reaction 3 reached its steady - state value in 3 s ; reactions 1 , 2 , 7 , 8 , 9 , and 10 reached their steady - state values in (cid:8) 10 s ; reactions 4 , 5 , 6 , and 11 reached their steady - state values within 50 s .

The availability of quantitative assays for Arp2 / 3 complex in live fission yeast ( 7 ) allowed us to verify that these mutations did not compromise function and will offer the opportunity to test the mechanisms studied here in live cells in the future . The association rate constant for Arp2 / 3 complex - binding actin filaments is slower than many macromolecular interac - tions .

As in the cases of phalloi - din ( 19 ) and cofilin ( 20 , 21 ) binding to actin filaments , few seg - ments of the filaments may be in a conformation favorable for binding Arp2 / 3 complex at any given time . The inactive con - formation of Arp2 / 3 complex may also be unfavorable for inter - acting with an actin filament . Alternatively , the initial interac - tion between Arp2 / 3 complex and actin filaments may be a fast reversible reaction that depends on a slow first order confor - mational change to produce the signal from pyrene - labeled Arp2 / 3 complex . Despite the slow rate of association , the affin - ity of Arp2 / 3 complex for a filament is relatively high due to the slow rate of dissociation . Perhaps conformational changes in both Arp2 / 3 complex and the mother filament together with the large contact area are responsible for the slow dissociation . The presence of a bound nucleation - promoting factor on Arp2 / 3 complex only had a modest effect on the rate that Arp2 / 3 complex binds filaments . With bound VCA , Arp2 / 3 complex did not bind actin filaments faster , but it dissociated from them three times faster . Thus it differs from the finding that the presence of 5 (cid:1) M actin filaments increases the affinity of human WASp rhodamine - VCA for bovine Arp2 / 3 complex 5 - fold . This may reflect mechanistic differences in the activity of Arp2 / 3 complex from fungi and mammals , either in their mechanism of binding actin filaments or may reflect differences in the equilibrium between different conformations induced by VCA and / or actin filament binding . Even with the development of pyrene - labeled Arp2 / 3 com - plex , we were unable to measure the rate of the interaction between an actin filament and the ternary complex of Arp2 / 3 complex with a bound nucleation - promoting factor and actin monomer . We doped a mixture of pyrene - labeled Arp2 / 3 com - plex and VCA with 1 (cid:1) M actin monomers to make the ternary complex before mixing with actin filaments . The time course of binding to actin filaments was the same as VCA - bound pyrene - labeled Arp2 / 3 complex . This result is inconclusive , because of a side reaction ; actin monomers assemble on the ends of the actin filaments faster than Arp2 / 3 complex binds to filaments , so actin monomers are depleted rather than remaining bound to VCA and Arp2 / 3 complex . Depletion of actin monomers by polymerization on a faster time scale than Arp2 / 3 complex binding to filaments also compromised FRET and anisotropy assays to measure interactions between actin monomers , VCA , and Arp2 / 3 complex in the presence of actin filaments . Capping barbed ends would overcome some of these problems but would complicate the experiments by adding competing reac - tions . Chemical cross - linking may be required to form a stable ternary complex for filament binding assays . In the absence of better biochemical data , for the purposes of kinetic simulations of actin filament branch formation by Arp2 / 3 complex , we assumed that an actin monomer bound to VCA does not change the interaction between VCA bound Arp2 / 3 complex and an actin filament and that the presence of actin filaments do not influence the rate of actin monomer association and dissociation with VCA bound to Arp2 / 3 com - plex . This assumption is reasonable , because it only affects the third , and last , reaction in the pathway ( Fig . 1 , reactions 5 , 6 , and 9 ) leading to activation , whereas earlier steps have a stronger influence on the predominant pathway . In fact , modest changes of 2 - to 10 - fold in the rates of these reactions do not affect the overall interpretation of pathway 4 as the dominant one in the simulations . Therefore , errors in the parameters for these reac - tions have only a small impact in the overall process of actin filament branch formation . Interactions between Arp2 / 3 Complex , VCA , and Actin Monomers — S . pombe Wsp1 - VCA binds S . pombe Arp2 / 3 com - plex and muscle actin monomers with high affinity , similar to previous findings with human WASp - VCA , muscle actin , and bovine Arp2 / 3 complex ( 3 ) . Compared with human WASp - VCA , fission yeast Wsp1 - VCA binds muscle actin monomers (cid:8) 4 - fold tighter and Arp2 / 3 complex 15 - fold tighter . Our FRET assay to measure interactions between Oregon Green - labeled actin monomers and rhodamine - VCA is much more sensitive than the anisotropy assay ( 3 ) . This sensitivity is important for measuring high affinity interactions with low nanomolar con - centrations of labeled probes . Even at low nanomolar concen - trations , the emission of Oregon Green - labeled actin is well above background , whereas readings for anisotropy measure - ments are only a few - fold above background . Similarities in the equilibrium dissociation constant between anisotropy and FRET - based assays demonstrate the lack of interference to this interaction by having a fluorescent probe attached near the C terminus of actin . We used both assays to measure interactions between VCA and Arp2 / 3 complex or actin monomers in the presence of the other component . The FRET assay showed that the presence of Arp2 / 3 complex inhibits the interaction of rhodamine - VCA and Oregon Green - labeled actin monomers ( Fig . 4 B ) . In the less sensitive anisotropy assay , actin monomers inhibited the inter - TABLE 2 Reactions and parameters used in the mathematical model shown in Fig . 1 A Reaction Description k (cid:2) k (cid:1) Reference (cid:1) M (cid:1) 1 s (cid:1) 1 s (cid:1) 1 1 Arp2 / 3 complex binding to VCA 0 . 8 0 . 74 ( 3 ) 2 VCA bound Arp2 / 3 complex binding to filament 1 . 5 (cid:2) 10 (cid:1) 4 0 . 2 (cid:2) 10 (cid:1) 3 This study , ( 3 ) 3 Arp2 / 3 complex binding to filament 1 . 5 (cid:2) 10 (cid:1) 4 1 . 0 (cid:2) 10 (cid:1) 3 This study 4 Filament bound Arp2 / 3 complex binding to VCA 0 . 8 0 . 15 ( 3 ) 5 Filament bound Arp2 / 3 complex binding to monomer bound VCA 0 . 4 0 . 15 This study , ( 3 ) 6 Filament bound Arp2 / 3 complex bound to VCA binding to actin monomer 21 . 5 25 . 7 This study , ( 3 ) 7 VCA binding to monomer 42 . 9 25 . 7 ( 3 ) 8 VCA bound monomer binding to Arp2 / 3 complex 0 . 4 0 . 74 This study , ( 3 ) 9 Arp2 / 3 complex bound VCA bound to monomer binding to filament 1 . 5 (cid:2) 10 (cid:1) 4 0 . 2 (cid:2) 10 (cid:1) 3 This study , ( 3 ) 10 Arp2 / 3 complex bound to VCA binding to monomer 21 . 5 25 . 7 This study , ( 3 ) 11 Activation of Arp2 / 3 complex 0 . 15 a 0 This study a Units are s (cid:1) 1 .

We conclude that Arp2 / 3 complex and actin monomers compete with each other for binding VCA as first pointed out by Kelly et al . ( 4 ) , who used anisotropy to show that binding of C region of VCA to actin monomers and Arp2 / 3 complex is mutually exclusive . The assay with Lat - A gave a contrary result , however , the effect of Lat - A is unknown in the context of this interaction . The similarity in the time course of Oregon Green - labeled actin dissociation from rhodamine - VCA in the presence and absence of Arp2 / 3 complex suggests that the mutually exclusive portion of the C region interacts with actin in the ternary complex of VCA , actin , and Arp2 / 3 complex . Activation —Several factors are thought to activate Arp2 / 3 complex to allow formation of an actin filament branch . In addition to assembling a stable ternary complex of Arp2 / 3 com - plex with a nucleation - promoting factor and an actin monomer bound to the side of an actin filament , Arp2 / 3 complex requires ATP and is proposed to require several conformational changes ( 12 , 22 ) . Formation of a short - pitch dimer between Arp2 and Arp3 is consistent with two - dimensional reconstructions of electron micrographs ( 18 , 23 , 24 ) , but these reconstructions do not show how the proposed clashes between subdomain 2 of Arp2 and ARPC3 or the helical insert in Arp3 and the first actin monomer of the daughter filament are accommodated in the branch junction ( 12 ) . A rate - limiting reaction with a rate constant of 0 . 15 s (cid:1) 1 ( t 1 ⁄ 2 (cid:10) 4 . 6 s ) between the binding of Arp2 / 3 complex - VCA - actin to the mother filament and elongation of the daughter filament improves the simulation of the time course of actin polymeri - zation in bulk samples . This “activation reaction” converts an inactive barbed end into a barbed end that can elongate by addition of actin monomers . This step might correspond to the conformational change that rearranges Arp2 relative to Arp3 , making an Arp dimer similar to the barbed end of an actin filament . Without a rate - limiting activation reaction following binding of Arp2 / 3 complex to the side of a filament , simulations proceed somewhat faster than the time course of actin polym - erization in bulk samples . Only a few more branches are formed with an activation rate constant of 1 . 5 s (cid:1) 1 rather than 0 . 15 s (cid:1) 1 . Differences in the overall branching nucleation reactions suggest that some of the reaction rates differ for the vertebrate and fission yeast systems . Under optimal conditions bovine Arp2 / 3 complex forms over 4 - fold more branches than fission yeast Arp2 / 3 complex ( 10 n M bovine Arp2 / 3 complex produced 8 n M ends ( 3 ) and 10 n M fission yeast Arp2 / 3 complex produced 2 n M ends ( 7 ) but 10 - fold less fission yeast Wsp1 - VCA was required than human WASp VCA , because of its higher affinity for actin monomers and Arp2 / 3 complex ) . Assuming a lower limit of 0 . 15 s (cid:1) 1 for the activation rate constant , another reac - tion must increase the efficiency of nucleation by bovine Arp2 / 3 complex . A good candidate is faster binding of bovine Arp2 / 3 complex to actin filaments . In our simulations binding of Arp2 / 3 complex to actin filaments must be 15 - fold faster to achieve a 4 - fold increase in the number of ends formed . These simulated reactions reached completion in under 300 s similar as seen by Marchand et al . Adjusting the rate constant for dis - sociation of Arp2 / 3 complex from actin filaments to agree with the K d of 2 (cid:1) M measured for recombinant human Arp2 / 3 com - plex ( 25 ) had little effect on the simulations . Overview of the Branching Pathway —The events producing the full time course of polymerization of mixtures of actin monomers , Arp2 / 3 complex , and VCA are more complicated than usually recognized . Simulations of the reactions in Fig . 5 C show that the reaction passes through several stages . Initially formation of new barbed ends is limited by the spontaneous nucleation of filaments from actin monomers to create binding sites for Arp2 / 3 complex . The formation of new barbed ends then speeds up as Arp2 / 3 complex binds to these first filaments and generates more ends in an autocatalytic manner . The branching reaction abruptly stops as growth of the filaments depletes actin monomers , which are no longer available to bind to VCA and Arp2 / 3 complex . The slow rate of association of Arp2 / 3 complex with a limited number of spontaneously formed actin filaments creates the initial lag in the time course of assembly . The rate of dissociation of Arp2 / 3 complex from actin filaments has little effect on the time course of the polym - erization reaction . For example , increasing the rate of dissoci - ation 10 - fold does not change the simulations . When actin monomers are available , a large fraction of Arp2 / 3 complexes that bind an actin filament eventually form a new barbed end , because the activation rate constant is at least 40 times faster than the rate of dissociation of Arp2 / 3 complex from actin fil - aments ( t 1 ⁄ 2 (cid:13) 200 s ) . Elongation of nascent branches ( Fig . 5 C , reaction 7 ) lags behind binding of the ternary complex to a mother filament ( Fig . 5 C , reactions 4 and 6 ) owing to the first order activation reaction . With critical details added to the pathway of actin filament branch formation , we reassessed the question of the dominant pathway in vivo , finding that it is the same pathway ( # 4 in Fig . 1 ) proposed by Marchand et al . ( 3 ) . Despite very slow association of Arp2 / 3 complex with actin filaments , this binding reaction is fast in the cell owing to the high local concentration of fila - ments . Pathways 2 and 3 , which begin with Arp2 / 3 complex associating with an actin filament ( 4 ) , are unlikely to be produc - tive collisions in vivo , due to nucleation - promoting factors being anchored to the membrane . Therefore , we discount these pathways as significant contributors to actin filament branch formation during cell motility . Pathways 1 and 5 begin with the same first step , but the second step is four times faster in path - way 5 than in pathway 1 . Pathway 4 is favored under the conditions of our simulations , but the effects of profilin have not been considered . Profilin competes with VCA for binding actin monomers ( 10 , 15 , 16 ) and binds to Arp2 ( 26 ) . Further characterization of these reac - tions and their inclusion in the mechanism may favor pathway 5 over 4 . Pathways 4 and 5 produce 1 . 2 (cid:1) M / s of actin filament branches in our simulation . With a half time for the activation reaction of 4 . 6 s , every second (cid:8) 14 % , or 170 n M , of inactive nascent branches are converted to growing actin filaments capable of pushing on the membrane or an intracellular bacte - rium to drive motility . Assuming that active nucleation - pro - moting factors are tethered to the plasma membrane in rapidly moving cells , it is likely that activation is restricted to a short Kinetics of Arp2 / 3 Complex Interactions MARCH 14 , 2008• VOLUME 283•NUMBER 11 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 7143 a t YA L E UN I V | K li ne S c i en c e L i b r a r y on F eb r ua r y 9 , 2009 www . j b c . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m interval of time ( perhaps (cid:11) 100 ms ) after the ternary complex binds to an actin filament . The remaining inactive branches would be recycled to the pool of reactants for continued motil - ity . Slow intrinsic association of Arp2 / 3 complex with actin filaments coupled with recycling mechanisms would maintain a soluble pool of Arp2 / 3 complex available to bind activated nucleation - promoting factors . Nucleation - promoting factors stay behind on the surface of Listeria ( 2 ) and on the plasma membrane of yeast ( 7 , 27 ) after interacting with Arp2 / 3 complex , so the VCA region must dis - sociate rapidly from Arp2 / 3 complex at branch junctions whether Arp2 / 3 complex is activated or not . This should allow a single , active nucleation - promoting factor to participate in multiple rounds of branching . The relative effects of physical coupling of nucleation - promoting factors to the plasma mem - brane and kinetics of interactions between VCA and Arp2 / 3 complex are unknown . An attractive hypothesis for regulation of cell motility is that cells control the amount of force gener - ated for motility directly through the amount of nucleation - promoting factors activated by signaling pathways . It will be critical to determine the concentration of active nucleation - promoting factors during cellular motility to understand this process better .
