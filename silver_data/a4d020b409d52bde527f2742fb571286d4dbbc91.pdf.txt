Using both light and high resolution electron microscopy , we analyzed the spatial and temporal rela - tionships between the Arp2 / 3 complex and the nucle - ation activity that is required for lamellipod extension in mammary carcinoma cells after epidermal growth factor stimulation . A rapid two - to fourfold increase in filament barbed end number occurs transiently after stimulation and remains confined almost exclusively to the extreme outer edge of the extending lamellipod ( within 100—200 nm of the plasma membrane ) . This is accompanied by an increase in filament density at the leading edge and a general decrease in filament length , with a specific loss of long filaments . Concomitantly , the Arp2 / 3 complex is recruited with a 1 . 5 - fold increase throughout the entire cortical filament network extend - ing 1—1 . 5 (cid:109) m in depth from the membrane at the lead - ing edge . The recruitment of the Arp2 / 3 complex at the membrane of the extending lamellipod indicates that Arp2 / 3 may be involved in initial generation of growing filaments . However , only a small subset of the complex present in the cortical network colocalizes near free barbed ends . This suggests that the 100—200 - nm sub - membraneous compartment at the leading edge of the extending lamellipod constitutes a special biochemical microenvironment that favors the generation and main - tenance of free barbed ends , possibly through the lo - cally active Arp2 / 3 complex , severing or decreasing the on - rate of capping protein . Our results are inconsistent with the hypothesis suggesting uncapping is the domi - nant mechanism responsible for the generation of nu - cleation activity . However , they support the hypothesis of an Arp2 / 3 - mediated capture of actin oligomers that formed close to the membrane by other mechanisms such as severing . They also support pointed - end cap - ping by the Arp2 / 3 complex , accounting for its wide dis - tribution at the leading edge . Key words : Arp2 / 3 complex • actin • nucleation sites • ultrastructure • chemotaxis M otility is an essential property of cells that is mandatory for normal and pathological pro - cesses such as embryonic development , inflam - matory responses , or tumor metastasis . In vitro , cell motility is largely associated with the ability to extend F - actin—rich protrusions , usually in the form of lamelli - pods ( Abercrombie et al . , 1970 ; Chen et al . , 1994 ; Ver - schueren et al . , 1994 ; Xie et al . , 1995 ; Lauffenburger and Horwitz , 1996 ; Mitchison and Cramer , 1996 ; Segall et al . , 1996 ; Condeelis , 1998 ) . It is believed that motility is largely dependent on localized actin polymerization at the leading edge of these structures ( Mitchison and Cramer , 1996 ; Mogilner and Oster , 1996 ; Chan et al . , 1998 ; Condeelis , 1998 ) , whereas further traction of the cell body is achieved through myosin motors ( Lee et al . , 1993 ; Oliver et al . , 1994 ; Lauffenburger and Horwitz , 1996 ; Svitkina et al . , 1997 ) . However , the mechanisms controlling actin poly - merization at the leading edge are still unclear . For actin to polymerize into filaments , some free ends must be cre - ated locally at the leading edge . Efficient polymerization requires that these ends are the fast growing barbed ends of the filaments . Three potential mechanisms can account for the genera - tion of free barbed ends ( for review see Eddy et al . , 1997 ) : uncapping preexisting filaments , severing preexisting fila - ments , or de novo nucleation of new filaments . Although some of these mechanisms appear more likely than others ( Eddy et al . , 1997 ) , the mechanism dominating generation of the nucleation sites at the leading edge and its associ - Address correspondence to Maryse Bailly , Department of Anatomy and Structural Biology , Albert Einstein College of Medicine , 1300 Morris Park Avenue , Bronx , NY 10461 .

Biochemical analyses have been very useful in giving insights into the potential mechanisms of actin polymerization . However , their rele - vance to the leading edge is unclear because they can only analyze whole cells . Since mammalian cells are highly compartmentalized , a detailed ultrastructural analysis of the leading edge is necessary . Some of this information has been provided for constitutively moving cells ( Small and Celis , 1978 ; Karlsson et al . , 1984 ; Small , 1988 ; Small et al . , 1995 ; Svitkina et al . , 1995 , 1997 ) and stimulated cells ( Hartwig and Shevlin , 1986 ; Hartwig and Yin , 1988 ; Hartwig and DeSisto , 1991 ; Rinnerthaler et al . , 1991 ; Cox et al . , 1995 ) , but none of those studies gave clear answers as to where and how the nucleation sites at the leading edge are generated . Previous studies have demonstrated , using cells microin - jected with or permeabilized in the presence of labeled G - actin , that most of the nucleation activity in constitu - tively moving cells is located at the leading edge of the cell ( Okabe and Hirokawa , 1989 ; Symons and Mitchison , 1991 ) . Okabe and Hirokawa ( 1989 ) used electron micros - copy to analyze the distribution of microinjected biotin - labeled actin , but focused more on internal structures such as stress fibers and focal contacts . They did show that labeled actin incorporation occurred initially at the (cid:210)membrane - associated , distal margin of actin meshworks . (cid:211) However , 5 min after injection , all lamellipodia actin fila - ments were labeled homogeneously ( Okabe and Hiro - kawa , 1989 ) , making it impossible to determine if the nu - cleation sites stayed stationary as the cell moved or if they moved with the membrane . A convenient way to control nucleation activity is to use a system where lamellipod ex - tension and cell motility can be stimulated with known re - producible kinetics ( Segall et al . , 1996 ; Bailly et al . , 1998 ) . Under such conditions , we showed that the newly gener - ated nucleation sites localize at the tips of lamellipods that extend after stimulation ( Chan et al . , 1998 ) . We present in this paper a comprehensive study of this phenomenon at the electron microscope level , analyzing the position of the nucleation sites relative to the membrane and the ultra - structure of the actin network at the leading edge as the lamellipod advances . Recently , it was shown that one of the major players controlling actin polymerization at the leading edge might be the Arp2 / 3 complex , a structure first described in Acan - thamoeba castellani . It is composed of two actin - related proteins , Arp2 and Arp3 , and five polypeptides , p40 , p35 , p19 , p18 , and p14 , all present in approximately equal stoichiometry ( Machesky et al . , 1994 ; Mullins et al . , 1997 ) . This complex appears to be conserved highly throughout evolution ( Machesky et al . , 1997 ; Welch et al . , 1997a ) , and a number of studies suggest that it might play a crucial role in promoting actin assembly in extending lamellipods ( Machesky et al . , 1997 ; Welch et al . , 1997a , b , 1998 ; Ma - chesky and Insall , 1998 ) . The Arp2 / 3 complex has been shown in vitro to interact with actin to increase nucleation activity , cap the pointed ends efficiently , and form branch - ing networks of filaments ( Mullins et al . , 1998 ) . Its ability to nucleate actin filaments can be enhanced greatly by ad - ditional factors ( Welch et al . , 1998 ) . This has led to the elaboration of a model attempting to describe how the Arp2 / 3 complex promotes actin polymerization and lamel - lipod extension ( Machesky and Way , 1998 ; Mullins et al . , 1998 ; Zigmond , 1998 ) . We describe here the first study an - alyzing the temporal and spatial relationships between the Arp2 / 3 complex and the actin nucleation sites at the lead - ing edge of cells after stimulation of lamellipod extension , using high resolution electron microscopy . This analysis enables the development of more refined models that ac - count for the control of actin polymerization at the leading edge , including how the nucleation sites might be gener - ated and what role the Arp2 / 3 complex might play in the complete process . Materials and Methods Cells MTLn3 metastatic rat mammary adenocarcinoma cells were provided by Dr . Garth Nicholson ( M . D . Anderson Cancer Center , Houston , TX ) . Cells were grown in alpha - MEM ( Gibco Laboratories ) , supplemented with 5 % FCS and antibiotics , as previously described ( Segall et al . , 1996 ) . Unless otherwise mentioned , MTLn3 cells were prepared for all experi - ments as follows : cells were plated at low density in complete medium for (cid:122) 24 h and starved for 3 h before the experiment in alpha - MEM medium supplemented with 0 . 35 % BSA and 12 mM Hepes ( starvation medium ) . Stimulation was done with a final concentration of 5 nM murine epider - mal growth factor ( EGF 1 ; Life Technologies , Inc . ) in starvation medium . Antibodies Monospecific anti - Arp3 , anti - p21 , and anti - p34 rabbit polyclonal antibod - ies were provided by Dr . Matthew Welch ( Department of Molecular and Cell Biology , University of California , Berkeley , CA ) , and have been characterized previously ( Welch et al . , 1997a ) . Anti - actin mAb was pur - chased from Boehringer Mannheim . Cy5 - conjugated goat anti – mouse IgG was purchased from Accurate Laboratories and Scientific Corp . Fluores - cein - conjugated goat anti – rabbit IgG was purchased from Cappel Labora - tories . Goat antibiotin antibodies coupled to 5 nm gold particles , and goat anti – rabbit antibodies coupled to 10 nm gold particles were purchased from Nanoprobes . Light Microscopy Immunofluorescence . Cells were plated on dishes ( Mattek ) or coverslips as previously described ( Bailly et al . , 1998 ) and stimulated with EGF or left untreated . They were fixed for 5 min at 37 (cid:56) C with 3 . 7 % formaldehyde in a buffer containing 5 mM KCl , 137 mM NaCl , 4 mM NaHCO 3 , 0 . 4 mM KH 2 PO 4 , 1 . 1 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM Pipes , 2 mM EGTA , and 5 . 5 mM glucose ( cytoskeleton stabilization buffer , pH 6 . 1 ; Small and Celis , 1978 ) . They were treated with cold methanol for 2 min , rinsed , and perme - abilized for 20 min at room temperature in 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 in stabiliza - tion buffer . Next , the cells were rinsed once with 0 . 1 M glycine in stabiliza - tion buffer and incubated for an additional 10 min in glycine . After five washes with TBS ( Tris 20 mM , NaCl 154 mM , pH 8 ) , the preparations were blocked / stabilized by incubation for 20 min with 5 (cid:109) M phalloidin ( Calbiochem - Novabiochem Corp . ) in TBS , pH 8 , supplemented with 1 % BSA and 1 % FCS . Cells were incubated further for 1 h with primary anti - bodies followed by five rinses in TBS plus 1 % BSA and incubation for 1 h with Cy5 - conjugated anti—mouse antibodies and FITC - conjugated anti— rabbit antibodies . After final washes , the coverslips were mounted in 50 % glycerol in TBS supplemented with 6 mg / ml N - propyl gallate . Nucleation Site Visualization and Arp2 / 3 Colocalization . Nucleation sites were visualized using a previously described protocol ( Chan et al . , 1998 ) with slight modifications . Briefly , cells grown on Mattek dishes were stim - ulated with EGF , and permeabilized in the presence of 0 . 45 (cid:109) M rhodamine - labeled actin ( Chan et al . , 1998 ) in buffer C ( 138 mM KCl , 10 mM 1 .

Relationship of Arp2 / 3 Complex to Actin Barbed Ends 333 Pipes , pH 6 . 9 , 0 . 1 mM ATP , 3 mM EGTA , pH 6 . 9 , 4 mM MgCl 2 ) with 0 . 025 % saponin and 1 % BSA for 1 min . After a brief rinse in buffer C cells were fixed in 3 . 7 % formaldehyde in cytoskeleton stabilization buffer ( see above ) for 5 min , followed by a 10 min incubation in 0 . 1 M glycine in cytoskeleton stabilization buffer . After a rinse in TBS , samples were incu - bated with 5 (cid:109) M phalloidin for 20 min in TBS / BSA / FCS ( pH 8 . 1 , see above ) , washed five times for 5 min with TBS / BSA , and mounted in 50 % glycerol in TBS , pH 8 . 1 , and 6 mg / ml N - propyl gallate . For colocaliza - tion of nucleation sites and Arp3 or p21 , cells were permeabilized in the presence of rhodamine - labeled actin and fixed with formaldehyde as above . The samples were treated further with methanol for 2 min before being processed for immunolabeling as described in the immunofluores - cence protocol above , with the Triton permeabilization step omitted . Fluorescence Quantification . Images were taken using constant settings on an Olympus IX70 microscope with 60 (cid:51) NA 1 . 4 infinity - corrected op - tics coupled to a computer - driven cooled CCD camera using IPLab Spec - trum software ( VayTek ) . The digitized images were converted linearly in NIH Image ( program developed at the National Institutes of Health and available on the internet at http : / / rsb . info . nih . gov / nih - image / ) and ana - lyzed using different macros . For measurement of the fluorescence from the leading edge back to (cid:122) 3 (cid:109) m inside the cell , the macro gives the mean of pixel intensity within 1 pixel concentric perimeter , running from the outside of the cell to the inside ( Chan et al . , 1998 ) . For the kinetic experi - ment , rhodamine fluorescence was expressed as the mean pixel intensity within a 1 . 1 - (cid:109) m band covering the whole cell perimeter at the leading edge . As shown previously ( Bailly et al . , 1998 ; Chan et al . , 1998 ) , lamelli - pods are flat and of uniform thickness so that variations in cell thickness do not contribute to fluorescence signal intensity . The same results were obtained using conventional imaging , confocal or digital deconvolution methods . Electron Microscopy Preparation of Biotin - labeled Actin . Biotin - labeled actin was prepared ac - cording to Okabe and Hirokawa ( 1989 ) with modifications . 25 mg of G - actin ( alpha / rabbit skeletal muscle ) was dialyzed for 24 h in depolymer - ization buffer ( 2 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM ATP ) . It was clarified for 20 min at 95 , 000 rpm in a centrifuge ( TL100 Ultracentri - fuge ; Beckman ) , diluted to 3 mg / ml in depolymerization buffer above , and polymerized at room temperature for 2 h by adding final concentrations of : 10 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 100 mM KCl , and 1 mM ATP . 8 mg N - hydroxysuccinimidobiotin ( Pierce Chemical ) was added to the so - lution and biotinylation was allowed to proceed for 10 min at room temper - ature . The reaction was quenched by adding 100 mg of sodium glutamate and F - actin was pelleted . Afterwards , F - actin was run through two cycles of polymerization / depolymerization , where the G - actin suspension was polymerized by adding 2 mM MgCl 2 , 50 mM KCl , 10 mM Pipes , pH 7 , in a water bath at room temperature for 1 h , and depolymerized in buffer A ( 2 mM Tris , pH 8 , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 02 % NaN 3 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 5 mM DTT ) . Actin was purified on a gel filtration column ( Sephadex G180 ; Pharmacia ) in buffer A . Storage was done in liquid nitrogen in 1 M sucrose . The initial coupling ratio was (cid:122) 2 mol ( biotin ) / mol ( actin ) , but some loss occurred on storage . The biotin - labeled actin had a polymerization activity comparable to that of unlabeled actin , both in terms of percent polymerizable at equilib - rium ( (cid:46) 90 % ) and polymerization rates ( as measured by viscometry ) . Preparation of Biotin - labeled Gelsolin—Actin Complexes ( b - GA2 ) . b - GA2 was prepared as described previously ( Chan et al . , 1998 ) using G - actin la - beled with biotin as described above . For immunoelectron microscopy and colocalization with the Arp2 / 3 complex , 100 nM of the complexes was used in place of biotin – actin in the permeabilization buffer and the prepa - rations were further processed as described below . Preparation of Samples for Negative Staining . MTLn3 cells were grown on formvar or parlodion – carbon - coated gold square support grids ( Elec - tron Microscopy Science ) on coverslips for 18 – 24 h . The immunoelectron microscopy was based on a previously described protocol ( Ursitti and Wade , 1993 ; Ursitti and Fowler , 1994 ) with some modifications . Cover - slips were treated with 0 . 25 % Triton X - 100 in buffer C in the presence of 1 % BSA and 0 . 45 (cid:109) M biotin - labeled actin for 1 min . After a rapid wash in buffer C , the preparations were fixed with 0 . 5 % glutaraldehyde in cyto - skeleton stabilization buffer , pH 6 – 6 . 1 , in the presence of 5 (cid:109)(cid:77) phalloidin for 10 min . The grids were rinsed in cytoskeletal buffer and incubated for 15 min in 50 mM NH 4 Cl in PBS ( 145 . 5 mM NaCl , 4 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 6 mM Na 2 HPO 4 (cid:63) 7 H 2 O ) , with a change to fresh solution after 7 min . This was followed by a 30 - min incubation in 0 . 1 % gelatin ( IGSS gelatin ; Amer - sham ) in PBS , with a change to fresh solution after 15 min . The grids were incubated for 6 h with 5 nm gold - conjugated antibiotin antibodies . They were washed three times for 10 min in 0 . 1 % gelatin , 1 min in 0 . 05 % Triton in PBS , and four 1 - min washes in PBS . They were postfixed in 1 % glu - taraldehyde / 5 (cid:109) M phalloidin in cytoskeleton stabilization buffer for 15 min , and transferred briefly in cytoskeleton stabilization buffer before be - ing negatively stained . For double labeling the actin and Arp2 / 3 complex , grids were treated additionally with methanol for 2 min before the NH 4 Cl step , blocked for 30 min with gelatin , and incubated for 1 . 5—2 h with anti - Arp3 or anti - p21 antibodies . The grids were rinsed three times for 10 min in 0 . 1 % gelatin and incubated for 6 h in a mixture of 5 nm gold - conjugated antibiotin anti - bodies and 10 nm gold - conjugated anti—rabbit antibodies . They were washed and postfixed as described above . For negative staining , the grids were transferred sequentially through four drops of 40 (cid:109) g / ml bacitracin in water and four drops of 1 % phosphotungstic acid . The grids were blotted dry and observed using 100 (cid:51) transmission electron microscope ( JEOL USA , Inc . ) at 80 kV . Preparation of Samples for Rapid Freezing , Freeze Drying , and Rotary Shadowing ( FDS ) . MTLn3 cells were grown on 5 - mm glass coverslips and processed for immunoelectron microscopy as described above . For better preservation of the actin cytoskeleton , methanol treatment during the double labeling with anti - Arp2 / 3 complex antibodies was done with 70 % methanol . After the postfixation step , coverslips were rinsed three times in water and processed for FDS based on the procedure described by Hartwig ( 1992 ) . Briefly , fixed coverslips were washed with two changes of distilled water . They were placed on a specimen mount of the rapid freez - ing apparatus ( CF100 ; Life Cell Corp . ) and frozen by slamming them into a liquid nitrogen – cooled copper block . Freezing tabs containing the frozen coverslips were transferred to a liquid nitrogen – cooled stage of a freeze fracture apparatus ( CFE - 50 ; Cressington ) , the stage temperature raised to (cid:50) 90 (cid:56) C for 90 min , and rotary shadowed at a 45 (cid:56) angle with 1 . 2 – 1 . 3 nm tan - talum - tungsten , and 2 . 5 nm carbon at 90 (cid:56) . Replicas were separated from the coverslip with 25 % hydrofluoric acid , washed into distilled water , and picked up on the surface of formvar - coated copper grids . The samples were observed using a JEOL 100CX transmission electron microscope at 100 kV . Images were viewed as negatives for better contrast , the gold par - ticles appearing white . Morphometric Analysis . Morphometric analysis was done on randomly chosen intact cytoskeletons . Leading edges of lamellipodia were identified at low magnification and their typical lamellipodial character , as defined by the presence of a dense orthogonal network of actin filaments ( see Figs . 5 and 7 ) , was confirmed at high magnification . In some instances , two different areas of the cell periphery were analyzed for unstimulated cells : nonlamellipodial areas , representing cell edges that did not possess the characteristics of lamellipodia ( see Figs . 5 A and 7 B ) ; and typical leading edges ( see Fig . 5 B ) . Unless those two categories are mentioned specifi - cally , all data for unstimulated cells ( EGF0 ) were obtained from typical lamellipodial areas . Quantitation was done using blind ( see Figs . 6 and 9 ) or double - blind ( see Figs . 8 and 10 ) methods . The negatives were scanned at high resolu - tion and the digitized images were transferred to NIH image . A macro was written that enabled us to analyze the distribution of the gold parti - cles : within a given area , the position of each particle was marked and we counted the particles in contiguous boxes . The size of the boxes was ad - justable so that we could analyze the distribution of the particles along the leading edge ( not shown ) , or across the leading edge . Typically boxes 2 - (cid:109) m wide were run at 0 . 1 - (cid:109) m steps into the leading edge , starting outside the cell ( see Fig . 5 E ) . Two different sizes of particles could be analyzed si - multaneously on the same image . This allowed direct colocalization of ac - tin and Arp2 / 3 on the same image , with the same reference for the mem - brane . Since the cells were Triton - permeabilized and exogenous actin had po - lymerized onto preexisting filaments , the membrane position was assigned as the external edge of the dense filament network at the leading edge . This was done easily and reproducibly at low magnification ( see Fig . 4 ) . ( A ) Analysis of the distribution of the nucleation sites and / or Arp2 / 3 com - plex ( see Figs . 6 A , 9 , and 10 ) . Consecutive boxes of 2 (cid:51) 0 . 1 (cid:109) m were drawn at the leading edge from the outside to the inside of the cells ( see Fig . 5 E ) and the number of particles in each box was plotted as a function of the distance of the box from the membrane . ( B ) Analysis of the fila - ment density at the leading edge ( see Fig . 6 B ) . Five lines were drawn per - pendicular to the membrane at the leading edge and the filaments crossing the lines were marked . The macro described above was run with 0 . 1 - (cid:109) m steps along the lines and the total number of filaments crossing each of the five lines was counted in each 0 . 1 (cid:109) m interval . ( C ) Analysis of filament length ( see Fig . 8 , Table I ) . Measurements were done using the standard length feature in NIH Image . Since most of the actin network at the lead - The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 145 , 1999 334 ing edge is within a single plane ( only a small proportion of the filaments are growing perpendicular to the lamellipod ) , the tracings and corre - sponding measurements were done in two dimensions only as shown in Fig . 7 G . Two complementary sets of data were generated : the global fila - ment population terminating within 0 . 5 – 1 (cid:109) m at the leading edge was ana - lyzed , both filaments with a free end and filaments within the network with no free end ( but showing distinctive origin and end at the intersection with another filament ) were followed carefully inside the network to their origin . The second analysis involved exclusive measurements of filaments with one free end terminating within 0 . 2 – 0 . 3 (cid:109) m at the leading edge and presenting an easily identifiable origin ( Fig . 7 G ) . The F - actin concentra - tion at the leading edge was calculated from the total length of filaments within a 1 (cid:51) 1 (cid:109) m square at the leading edge , assuming a thickness of 176 (cid:54) 14 nm for the lamellipod in that particular zone ( Lanni , F . , personal com - munication ) , and a monomer size within the filament of 2 . 75 nm ( Kabsch and Vandekerckhove , 1992 ) . Results Distribution of Actin , Actin Nucleation Sites , and Arp2 / 3 Complex MTLn3 cells stimulated with EGF undergo a broad lamel - lipod extension which is maximal within 3 min and driven by actin polymerization at the leading edge ( Segall et al . , 1996 ; Chan et al . , 1998 ) . Using this well characterized model , we investigated the relationship between sites of actin polymerization and Arp2 / 3 complex location in lead - ing edges . We used antibodies raised against three differ - ent subunits of the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Arp3 , p21 , and p34 ; Welch et al . , 1997a ) to analyze the distribution of the Arp2 / 3 complex in these cells . We first analyzed the local - ization of the Arp2 / 3 complex in MTLn3 cells in reference to actin distribution . Since these anti - Arp2 / 3 complex anti - bodies all require methanol fixation , which alters phalloi - din binding , actin was visualized in the cells using anti - actin antibodies . The pattern obtained for actin using anti - actin antibodies was virtually identical to the F - actin pattern revealed by fluorescent phalloidin labeling ( data not shown ) . Immunofluorescence data show that the Arp3 and p21 subunits of the Arp2 / 3 complex colocalize with ac - tin at the leading edge of these stimulated cells ( Fig . 1 A ) . Although the signal was somewhat weaker , p34 showed a similar distribution ( data not shown ) . None of the proteins localized to stress fibers , though occasional weak staining of stress fibers was noticed with the anti - Arp3 antibodies ( data not shown , see Fig . 3 , EGF3 ) . Some cytoplasmic staining was also observed , including staining in discrete particles that also contain F - actin , as demonstrated by FITC - phalloidin staining ( data not shown ) . The nuclear staining represented mostly nonspecific binding of the sec - ondary antibodies . Quantitative analysis of the distribu - tion of actin and Arp3 or p21 at the leading edge showed Figure 1 . Arp2 / 3 complex colocalizes with F - actin at the leading edge of cells after stimulation . Cells were stimu - lated with EGF for 3 min , fixed , permeabilized , and im - munostained for Arp2 / 3 and actin . ( A ) Both Arp3 and p21 localize in the actin - rich zone at the extreme periphery of the cells ( matching arrow - heads ) . Frames 1 and 3 , actin ; frame 2 , Arp3 ; and frame 4 , p21 . The box indicates the size of the region at the lead - ing edge where all further analyses were done , includ - ing electron microscopy . In cells stimulated with a uni - form upshift of EGF , the en - tire periphery of the cell be - comes a lamellipod , the leading edge of which is identical to the leading edge of a polar - ized cell ( Segall et al . , 1996 ; Bailly et al . , 1998 ; Chan et al . , 1998 ) . Therefore , the box could be positioned at ran - dom sites on the periphery of a stimulated cell . ( B ) Quanti - tation of immunofluorescence showing colocalization of Arp2 / 3 and actin within 1 . 5 (cid:109) m at the leading edge . The fluorescence intensity graphed is the mean of the entire cell perimeter for 1 - pixel - wide steps ( see Materials and Methods ) . Gray diamonds represent actin ; circles , Arp3 ; and squares represent p21 . Both Arp2 / 3 ( Arp3 and p21 ) and actin concen - trations peak within 0 . 5 (cid:109) m of the leading edge . The increase in fluorescence intensity that is observed further back from the membrane occurs because of interference from stress fibers for the actin and dense particles for Arp3 and p21 , which emphasizes the need to use electron microscopy in this analysis . Bar , 10 (cid:109) m . Bailly et al . Relationship of Arp2 / 3 Complex to Actin Barbed Ends 335 very similar localization , both protein concentrations max - imizing within (cid:44) 1 µm at the leading edge ( Fig . 1 B ) . We demonstrated previously that EGF - stimulated lamel - lipod extension is dependent on actin polymerization at the leading edge ( Segall et al . , 1996 ; Chan et al . , 1998 ) . By permeabilizing stimulated cells in the presence of 0 . 45 (cid:109) M rhodamine - labeled actin stimulation , the sites of actin nu - cleation ( i . e . , free barbed ends ) can be visualized directly ( Chan et al . , 1998 ) . Since 0 . 45 (cid:109) M is below the critical con - centration for the pointed end ( Pollard , 1986 ) , only free barbed ends are visualized ( Symons and Mitchison , 1991 ; Chan et al . , 1998 ) . As the polymerization of exogenous G - actin is not diffusion limited ( Chan et al . , 1998 ) , exogenous and endogenous G - actin must be exchanged rapidly , and endogenous G - actin should fall to negligible levels quickly after permeabilization . This is consistent with the unifor - mity of rhodamine—actin incorporation into the leading edge observed in our experiments that would not occur if there were punctate pools of endogenous G - actin released during permeabilization . Under the current experimental conditions , most of the nucleation activity is localized within (cid:44) 2 (cid:181)m at the leading edge after stimulation ( see be - low ) . Quantitative analysis of fluorescence within that spe - cific zone at the leading edge ( Fig . 1 A , frame 2 , boxed area ) gives an accurate view of the kinetics of appearance of the nucleation sites : EGF stimulation generates a tran - sient increase in nucleation activity , peaking sharply at 50 s , and generates an average 2 . 4 - fold increase in nucleation activity at the leading edge ( Fig . 2 ) .

Relationship of Arp2 / 3 Complex to Actin Barbed Ends 337 We performed direct colocalization of these active nu - cleation sites and the Arp3 subunit in MTLn3 cells after stimulation ( Fig . 3 ) . In unstimulated cells ( EGF0 ) , Arp3 is enriched in the peripheral submembraneous compart - ment , in conjunction with nucleation activity , and in ruf - fling areas . After EGF stimulation ( EGF1 ) , Arp3 is re - cruited homogeneously to the extreme edge of cells in conjunction with newly created nucleation sites ( Fig . 3 , EGF1 ) . After 3 min ( EGF3 ) , nucleation activity remains confined to the very submembraneous compartment and the tips of the stress fibers ( presumably focal contacts ) . Arp3 distribution also is restricted mainly to the outer - most part of the leading edge but sometimes tends to ex - tend further inside the cell , beyond the nucleation site location . Some particulate staining is seen in these con - ditions that correspond to small dorsal protrusions contain - ing F - actin , Arp3 , and nucleation sites ( Fig . 3 , EGF1 ; Bailly et al . , 1998 ) . These are similar to the Arp - , capping protein - , and actin - containing dorsal protrusions recently described on fibroblasts ( Schafer et al . , 1998 ) . Ultrastructural Characterization of Actin Nucleation Activity at the Leading Edge The above results showed that Arp2 / 3 complex and nucle - ation sites colocalize at the leading edge , but the resolu - tion of light microscopy ( (cid:122) 0 . 3 (cid:109) m ) was not sufficient to determine if they actually overlapped . To study the distri - bution of the nucleation sites at the leading edge of lamel - lipods at high resolution as well as their spatial and tem - poral relationship with the Arp2 / 3 complex , we adapted the protocol used to visualize nucleation sites at the light microscope level and used biotin - labeled actin to visualize nucleation sites at the electron microscope level . We stud - ied the leading edge where the lamellipod is flat enough to allow unequivocal identification of actin - containing struc - tures relative to the plasma membrane . To obtain a com - prehensive view of the cytoskeleton’s ultrastructure at the leading edge , independent of technique - specific artifacts , we used both negative staining and FDS techniques . The kinetics , amplitude , and localization of the nucleation ac - tivity obtained with these techniques were strikingly simi - lar to those measured at the light microscope level , as well as highly reproducible ( data not shown ) . We used only light permeabilization ( low detergent concentration and short extraction time ) to minimalize extraction . Under such con - ditions , even omitting the exogenous actin in the permeabi - lization step does not affect the structure of the cytoskel - eton at the leading edge markedly ( Chan et al . , 1998 ) . Negatively stained images show that the cytoskeleton at the leading edge is arranged as a dense network of filaments ( Figs . 4 and 5 ) . In unstimulated cells , two types of cytoskele - ton organization are found : cell edges in nonlamellipodial areas ( not organized as leading edges ) contain loose net - works of long filaments with little , if any , exogenous biotin - labeled actin incorporation ( as revealed by the presence of 5 nm gold particles , Fig . 5 A ) ; and typical leading edges of dense filament networks where individual filaments can be seen growing radially from the edge , with some exogenous biotin - labeled actin incorporation ( Fig . 5 B ) . After stimula - tion , a large proportion of the cell periphery is arranged as a typical leading edge with a broad peripheral lamellipod ex - tension ( Figs . 1 and 2 ; Bailly et al . , 1998 ) . The filaments form a denser network of actin where intense biotin - labeled actin Figure 6 . Morphometric analysis of the distribution of nucleation sites and filament density at the leading edge . ( A ) Quantitation of nucleation activity at the leading edge was done on negatively stained samples by analyzing the distribution of the gold particles reflecting biotin - labeled actin incorporation , using a macro de - signed for NIH Image , as described in Fig . 5 . All the counts were performed blind : ( squares ) unstimulated cells , nonlamellipod - like edges ( see Fig . 5 A ) ; ( open circles ) leading edges in unstimu - lated cells ( see Fig . 5 B ) ; ( triangles ) EGF 30 s ; ( diamonds ) EGF 1 min ( see Fig . 5 C ) ; ( stars ) EGF 3 min ; and ( closed circles ) EGF 5 min .

Morphometric analysis of the distribution of the nucleation sites was conducted using a macro running in NIH Image ( see Materials and Methods ) . With the membrane position set as the extreme edge of the lamellipod when viewed at low magnification ( Fig . 4 ) , the macro enabled us to count the gold particles in contiguous 2 (cid:51) 0 . 1 (cid:109) m 2 boxes from the outside to a few microns inside Figure 7 .

Relationship of Arp2 / 3 Complex to Actin Barbed Ends 339 the cell ( Fig . 5 D ) . The resulting distribution was plotted ( Fig . 6 A ) . On the same negatives , the filament density at the leading edge was evaluated , with the same membrane reference as that taken for the gold particle counts ( Fig . 6 B ) . Quantitation of nucleation activity as biotin—actin den - sity at the leading edge confirms a transient increase 1 min after stimulation and a rapid decrease back to resting lev - els after 3 min ( Fig . 6 A and data not shown ) . The maxi - mum nucleation activity generated after stimulation is confined within a 0 . 2—0 . 3 (cid:109) m zone , directly at the mem - brane , and only residual ( background ) nucleation activity remains (cid:46) 1—1 . 5 (cid:109) m away from the membrane ( Fig . 6 A ) . As opposed to the sharp location and transient generation of nucleation sites , EGF stimulation results in an (cid:122) 1 . 5 - fold increase in filament density within a 1 . 5—2 - (cid:109) m zone adjacent to the membrane . This high density remains for 5 min after stimulation ( Fig . 6 B ) . Thus , the maximum nu - cleation activity generated after stimulation is confined to a narrower region than the one covered by the high fila - ment density zone generated after stimulation . To get greater insight into the three - dimensional fila - ment architecture at the leading edge , we used the FDS technique . This technique allows a very high resolution of the cytoskeleton with minimum reorganization of the actin filaments , potentially minimizing the generation of arti - facts . The results obtained using this technique were en - tirely consistent with those acquired on negatively stained samples . Furthermore , the diameter of the filaments ob - served in the replicas was routinely (cid:44) 11 nm , indicating that a high degree of resolution was achieved with minimal metal deposition . We analyzed the filament architecture at the leading edge of the cells before and after stimulation with EGF . As with negative staining , leading edges could be identi - fied easily by their typical orthogonal arrangement of fila - ments with a denser zone at the extreme edge ( Fig . 7 , A and C ) , as opposed to loose bundles of parallel filaments in other parts of the cells ( Fig . 7 B ) . The 5 nm gold particle distribution reveals filaments that have incorporated biotin—actin , localizing the active nucleation sites at the ex - treme edge of the cells ( Fig . 7 , D and E , and data not shown ) , as shown previously with negative staining ( Figs . 5 and 6 A ) . The network of actin filaments was denser after stimulation ( Fig . 7 C ) . Different types of filament crossing and / or branching were observed ( Fig . 7 F ) including : branching with an angle of (cid:122) 70 (cid:56) , typical of the in vitro branching observed for Arp2 / 3 complex ( Machesky and Way , 1998 ; Mullins et al . , 1998 ) on filaments growing radi - ally at the leading edge or within the network ; T - branching inside the network at the leading edge ( Niederman et al . , 1983 ; Hartwig and Shevlin , 1986 ) ; and Y - branching and filament branching with smaller angles ( Niederman et al . , 1983 ; Hartwig and Shevlin , 1986 ) .

For data set # 1 , filaments terminating within a 0 . 5 – 1 (cid:109) m area at the leading edge were measured carefully using high magnification and control viewing in three dimensions using stereo images . Both filaments with a free end and filaments with no visible free ends ( but terminating clearly on both ends at an intersection with another filament ) were included in the study . In total , 51 cells ( 10 – 19 per time point ) were analyzed for data set # 1 . For data set # 2 , only filaments with one free end terminating within 0 . 2 – 0 . 3 (cid:109) m at the leading edge and showing an easily identifiable origin were analyzed . 92 cells ( 20 – 32 per time point ) from two different experiments were analyzed for data set # 2 . ‡ Filament length is expressed as mean (cid:54) SE ; n is the total number of filaments ana - lyzed for each time point . § In unstimulated cells ( EGF0 ) , the peripheral regions of analyzed cells were divided in two categories : nonlamellipodial areas ( EGF0 / no LE ) , where no distinctive leading edge structure could be identified ; and leading edge - type areas ( EGF0 / LE ) that pre - sented the characteristic aspect and the dense orthogonal actin network of a leading edge ( see Materials and Methods ) . Figure 8 . Filament length distribution within a 1 - (cid:109) m zone at the leading edge . Filament length was measured on samples pro - cessed for FDS using NIH Image ( see Materials and Methods and Table I ) . The data correspond to data set # 1 in Table I . ( A ) Cell edges not organized as typical leading edges in resting cells are shown ( Fig . 7 B ) . ( B ) Leading edges in resting cells are shown . ( C ) Leading edges in cells stimulated with EGF for 1 min ( Fig . 7 C ) and ( D ) leading edges in cells stimulated with EGF for 3 min are shown . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 145 , 1999 340 actin filaments was evaluated in a 1 (cid:51) 1 (cid:109) m 2 box at the leading edge , and was found to be 66 (cid:54) 6 (cid:109) m / (cid:109) m 2 . Assum - ing 176 (cid:54) 14 nm for the thickness of the lamellipod at the leading edge ( Lanni , F . , personal communication ) , this gave us an approximate concentration of 9 . 3 mg / ml for F - actin at the leading edge . We measured the length of the filaments within 1 (cid:109) m of the leading edge ( see Materials and Methods ) . Two differ - ent sets of data were generated corresponding either to the total filament population at the leading edge ( Fig . 8 , Table I , data set # 1 ) , or a more restricted compartment corresponding exclusively to filaments with one free end ( Table I , data set # 2 , Fig . 7 G ) . Both sets of data show an average 30 % decrease in filament length at the leading edge 1 min after EGF stimulation compared with unstimu - lated cells ( Table I , nonlamellipodial and lamellipodial ar - eas combined ) . This is consistent with measurements made on negatively stained samples showing 32 and 28 % decreases in length at 1 and 3 min , respectively ( data not shown ) . The filament length distribution within a 1 - (cid:109) m zone behind the membrane of resting cells ( nonlamellipo - dial - type and typical leading edges combined ) is widely distributed with filaments ranging in size from 30 to 1 , 000 nm ( Fig . 8 , A and B ) . In contrast , after EGF stimulation Figure 9 . Arp3 and p21 are re - cruited to the leading edge after stimulation . Cells were perme - abilized in the presence of 0 . 45 (cid:109) M biotin—actin , fixed , and pro - cessed for immunostaining with 5 nm gold - conjugated antibiotin antibodies and rabbit anti - Arp3 or rabbit anti - p21 antibodies fol - lowed by 10 nm gold - conjugated anti—rabbit antibodies . Samples were processed for FDS ( A ) or negatively stained with 1 % phosphotungstic acid and the distribution of the particles was analyzed in NIH Image ( B ) as described in Fig . 5 D .

Images shown are from the leading edge of a cell 1 min after stimulation : large ( (cid:50) 10 nm gold ) particles , p21 distribution ( examples shown at large arrow - heads ) , small ( (cid:50) 5 nm gold ) par - ticles , and biotin—actin distribu - tion ( small arrows ) .

Relationship of Arp2 / 3 Complex to Actin Barbed Ends 341 the cell periphery consists of broad lamellipodial struc - tures with typical leading edges containing mainly short filaments , ranging from 30 to (cid:44) 300 nm ( Fig . 8 C ) . This par - ticular arrangement of short filaments persists after 3 min of stimulation ( Fig . 8 D ) , and is consistent with the mainte - nance of a high filament density ( Fig . 6 B ) . The specific loss of long filaments that accompanies the general de - crease in filament length after stimulation strongly sug - gests the intervention of a filament severing activity . Spatial and Temporal Relationships between the Nucleation Sites and Arp2 / 3 Complex The Arp2 / 3 complex is present at the leading edge ( Fig . 9 A , frame 1 ) and shows the distribution expected ( Mullins et al . , 1997 , 1998 ) . It can be identified on the sides of fila - ments ( Fig . 9 A , frames 1 and 4 ) and at filament intersec - tions ( Fig . 9 A , frames 1 – 4 ) . As a control , the distribution of another cross - linking protein , ABP280 , was also ana - lyzed . As expected from previous work ( Hartwig et al . , 1980 ; Hartwig and Shevlin , 1986 ) , ABP280 is present at the leading edge where it localizes at filament intersec - tions , and unlike Arp2 / 3 complex , does not show any obvi - ous side binding ( data not shown ) . Colocalization of the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Arp3 and p21 subunits ) and the nucleation sites was performed on nega - tively stained samples using the morphometric analysis de - scribed above . For each cell , Arp2 / 3 ( 10 nm gold particles ) and the nucleation sites ( 5 nm gold particles ) were mea - sured on the same image with the same reference for the position of the membrane ( determined as above ) . The amount of Arp3 at the leading edge approximately dou - bles 1 min after EGF stimulation and is distributed as a broad peak starting (cid:122) 100 nm back from the membrane ( offset from the nucleation sites , Fig . 9 B ) . 3 min after stimulation , the amount of Arp3 at the leading edge is slightly reduced , but is still higher than before stimulation . p21 distribution follows the same trend as Arp3 ( Fig . 9 B ) . During this 3 - min interval of stimulation with EGF , the membrane has moved (cid:122) 5 . 2 (cid:109) m to the left ( data not shown ) . To refine our positioning of the Arp2 / 3 complex relative to the barbed ends and obtain a precise count of the num - ber of barbed ends , we used a different method to localize barbed ends . Since our usual method involves the growth of the actin filaments from exogenous actin , we designed an experiment where we could prevent actin polymeriza - tion , and label barbed ends directly where they are by cap - ping them with b - GA2 . As shown in Fig . 10 , under these conditions the edge of Arp3 distribution is still offset from the membrane , whereas the barbed end distribution re - mains highly localized at the membrane . In addition , the concentration of the Arp2 / 3 complex at the leading edge barely doubles after stimulation , whereas there is a five - fold increase in barbed ends . Discussion Organization of the Leading Edge of Cells after Stimulation Although the extreme edge of MTLn3 cells has some fea - tures comparable to those of constitutively moving cells such as keratocytes ( Svitkina et al . , 1997 ) , the general or - ganization of the actin cytoskeleton in these carcinoma cells more closely resembles that of chemotactic ameboid cells such as macrophages ( Hartwig and Shevlin , 1986 ) , leukocytes ( Ryder et al . , 1984 ) , and Dictyostelium discoi - deum ( Rubino and Small , 1987 ; Cox et al . , 1995 ) . In un - stimulated cells , the cytoskeleton at the periphery is ar - ranged as a loose network of long , occasionally bundled , Figure 10 . Colocalization of Arp3 and gelsolin - capped actin barbed ends at the leading edge . Cells were permeabilized in presence of 100 nM b - GA2 ( GA2 ) , fixed , and processed for immunostaining as in Fig . 9 . Samples were negatively stained with 1 % phosphotungstic acid . Squares represent unstimulated cells and circles represent cells stimulated with EGF for 1 min . The vertical bar marks the posi - tion of the membrane . The top frames show barbed end ( GA2 ) distribution and the bottom frames show matching Arp sub - unit distribution ( left , Arp3 ; right , p21 ) . The data for the Arp3 set are pooled from three experiments with a total of 28 and 29 cells for EGF0 and EGF1 , respectively . The data from the p21 set are from one experiment with a total of 9 and 10 cells for EGF0 and EGF1 , re - spectively . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 145 , 1999 342 filaments . Some cells are polarized and present a leading edge where filaments are arranged in a 1 – 1 . 5 - (cid:109) m wide , high density orthogonal network , similar to the leading edge of unstimulated fibroblasts ( Small and Celis , 1978 ; Small , 1981 , 1988 ; Svitkina et al . , 1997 ) . The density of fila - ments rapidly decreases a few microns away from the edge . After stimulation , the density and width of the or - thogonal network at the edge increases and a clear zone , mostly devoid of actin filaments , is created behind the leading edge as the lamellipod advances . These are fea - tures that are not observed in keratocytes ( Small et al . , 1995 ; Svitkina et al . , 1997 ) . The network at the leading edge of MTLn3 cell is composed of tightly entangled inter - woven filaments , featuring multiple intersections of two or more filaments , and its complexity increases with filament density after stimulation . Most of the filaments inside the network are relatively short ( 0 . 2 – 0 . 3 (cid:109) m on average be - fore stimulation and even less after stimulation ) . This is slightly shorter than previously reported filament lengths measured on quick frozen deep - etched macrophages ( 0 . 5 (cid:109) m ; Yin and Hartwig , 1988 ) , or inferred from depoly - merization kinetics in leukocytes ( 0 . 3 (cid:109) m ; Cano et al . , 1991 ) . However , it is remarkably similar to what has been measured in stimulated platelets ( 0 . 1 – 0 . 3 (cid:109) m ; Hartwig , 1992 ) or in Dictyostelium , where the mean filament length was 0 . 2 (cid:109) m with a large proportion of small ( (cid:44) 140 nm ) fil - aments ( Podolski and Steck , 1990 ) . The Arp2 / 3 complex can generate 70 (cid:56) angle branches between filaments in vitro ( Mullins et al . , 1998 ) . In vivo , a large subset of the branches observed in the cytoskeleton of keratocytes displays similar 70 (cid:56) angles ( Svitkina et al . , 1997 ) . This has drawn others to the conclusion that Arp2 / 3 could be a major component of cytoskeleton organization by nucleating and branching actin filaments ( Machesky and Way , 1998 ; Mullins et al . , 1998 , Zigmond , 1998 ) . Al - though we have noticed some 70 (cid:56) branching at the leading edge of MTLn3 cells , the organization of the cytoskeleton that we observed is more typical of what has been de - scribed in chemotactic ameboid cells , with a more complex set of branching , including T - , Y - , and X - branching ( Ryder et al . , 1984 ; Hartwig and Shevlin , 1986 ; Cox et al . , 1995 ) . This morphology does not appear to be technique depen - dent , but rather common to chemotactic cells as seen by different techniques such as critical point drying ( Hartwig and Shevlin , 1986 ; Wolosewick and Condeelis , 1986 ) , FDS ( this study and Hartwig and Shevlin , 1986 ) , or negative staining ( this study and Small , 1988 ) . Although we have lo - calized the Arp2 / 3 complex at filament vertices , other cross - linkers like ABP280 are present at the leading edge ( data not shown ) where they can contribute to maintain the integrity of the cytoskeleton and define filament branching ( Cunningham et al . , 1992 ; Cox et al . , 1995 ) . In - deed , the three - dimensional architecture of the cytoskele - ton , the distance between filament intersections ( data not shown ) , and the actin concentration that we measured at the leading edge are consistent with a network of actin and filamin - type cross - linkers ( Hartwig et al . , 1980 ; Niederman et al . , 1983 ) . The relative contributions of these different molecules to filament organization might differ from one type of cell to the other , which could explain why a 70 (cid:56) Arp2 / 3 branching pattern is more common in the kerato - cyte ( Svitkina et al . , 1997 ) . Alternatively , Arp2 / 3 branch - ing might be more involved in constitutive movement , as shown in keratocytes , as opposed to transient and rapid re - organization of the cytoskeleton after EGF stimulation . Interestingly , we also see the Arp2 / 3 complex along the sides of filaments in the absence of any obvious branching , in agreement with previous in vitro observations ( Mullins et al . , 1997 , 1998 ) . Spatial and Temporal Regulation of the Arp2 / 3 Complex EGF stimulation triggers a transient increase in nucleation activity that is highly controlled in terms of kinetics ( sharp peak at 50 – 60 s ) and localization ( within 100 – 200 nm at the extreme edge of the lamellipod ) . The position of the nucleation sites remains constant with respect to the mem - brane of the extending edge as the cells form lamellipods . The increase in nucleation activity after stimulation is ac - companied by an increase in filament density at the lead - ing edge , covering a zone extending up to 2 – 2 . 5 (cid:109) m further inside the cells . Both light and electron microscopy show that the Arp2 / 3 complex is localized within this network , where its concentration increases after EGF stimulation . Although a subset is present close to the membrane where Figure 11 . Model of generation of nucleation sites at the leading edge after stimulation : cooperation of Arp2 / 3 complex and a cofi - lin - like severing activity . Numbers above arrows show the rate constants for each reaction ( events / s ) , calculated from the molar on - rate constants presented in Mullins et al . ( 1998 ) and assuming a G - actin concentration of 1 (cid:109) M . Longer arrows show preferred direction for the reactions . The rate constant of assembly of actin monomers into a dimer virtually precludes spontaneous genera - tion of actin dimers in vivo ( dotted line ) . Similarly , the formation of a complex between Arp2 / 3 and one actin monomer and the addition of a second actin monomer to this complex to create a nucleus is extremely unlikely . We propose that EGF stimulation triggers a signal that transiently and locally turns on cofilin activ - ity at the leading edge . Activated cofilin severs preexisting fila - ments , generating small actin oligomers free both at their pointed ends and barbed ends ( n designates two or more subunits ) . The oligomers are captured and stabilized by capping of pointed ends by the Arp2 / 3 complex to efficiently generate nucleation sites for actin polymerization . These stable nuclei can then polymerize very rapidly until their barbed ends are capped by capping pro - tein ( not shown ) . Bailly et al . Relationship of Arp2 / 3 Complex to Actin Barbed Ends 343 the nucleation sites are , the distribution of the Arp2 / 3 complex is not restricted to the 100 – 200 - nm polymeriza - tion zone at the membrane , but extends 1 . 5 – 2 (cid:109) m inside the dense F - actin network both before and after stimula - tion . Furthermore , in most cases , the increase in Arp2 / 3 concentration at the membrane does not reflect the in - crease in nucleation activity : the Arp2 / 3 amount never in - creases more than twofold in any of our experiments , whereas up to fivefold increases were observed for the number of free barbed ends ( Fig . 10 ) . 1 min after stimula - tion , the Arp2 / 3 concentration is maximum close to the membrane , and decreases back to the level measured in unstimulated cells within a distance of 2 (cid:109) m from the growing edge . This corresponds to the site where the mem - brane was located before stimulation ( since the lamellipod has extended 2 . 2 (cid:109) m at 1 min and 5 . 2 (cid:109) m at 3 min after stimulation , data not shown ) . Thus , we propose that the Arp2 / 3 distribution that we observed is the result of the progressive binding of Arp2 / 3 to filaments as the leading edge advances . The Arp2 / 3 complex is recruited to fila - ments under the membrane as the nucleation activity in - creases but , unlike the nucleation sites that continue to ad - vance with the membrane , the majority of the Arp2 / 3 complex stays in place . This suggests that Arp2 / 3 is func - tioning as a pointed end capper , which would explain the broad peak of Arp2 / 3 distribution compared with the sharp peak of nucleation sites at the leading edge . Interaction of Arp2 / 3 and the Nucleation Sites at the Leading Edge The Arp2 / 3 complex caps the pointed ends of actin fila - ments with high affinity ( Mullins et al . , 1998 ) . Could the Arp2 / 3 complex have only a passive role of pointed - end capping at the leading edge ? In this model , the increase in Arp2 / 3 concentration at the leading edge after stimulation simply could reflect the increase in pointed ends that we observed ( Chan et al . , 1998 ) . However , the Arp2 / 3 distri - bution does not follow exactly the filament distribution , as it tends to increase more than the filament number does , and drops more rapidly than the filament density within 2 (cid:109) m of the leading edge . While we cannot rule out a simple pointed - end capping role for Arp2 / 3 , it seems likely that the complex has a more active role in actin polymer - ization . Altogether , the increase in the number of pointed ends observed after stimulation ( Chan et al . , 1998 ) , the de - crease in filament length , and disappearance of the long filaments shown here rule out uncapping as the dominant mechanism for generating the increase in nucleation activ - ity observed at the leading edge after EGF stimulation . Nonetheless , uncapping could be the mechanism responsi - ble for generating the nucleation sites that we see at the ends of the stress fibers , since the growth happens only at the extreme ends of the stress fibers ( i . e . , not consistent with severing ) and does not seem to involve any Arp2 / 3 complex recruitment . The other two mechanisms capable of generating new nucleation sites after stimulation are de novo nucleation or severing ( or both combined ) . Both mechanisms could account for the decrease in filament length that we observed : the former because it might gen - erate a large population of filaments that will be shorter than the preexisting ones , and the latter because it actually cuts the preexisting filaments into smaller ones . However , the disappearance of the longer filaments that we ob - served immediately after stimulation is highly suggestive of a severing mechanism . Original work on the Arp2 / 3 complex suggested that it could nucleate actin polymerization at the surface of the bacteria , Listeria monocytogenes ( Welch et al . , 1997b ) . However , the Arp2 / 3 complex probably is not a true nu - cleator , but rather captures and stabilizes unstable actin dimers ( Mullins et al . , 1998 ) . The rate constants of assem - bly / disassembly of actin monomers into a dimer are such that the probability of generating actin dimers from free monomers or monomers bound to sequestering proteins in vivo is essentially null . Similarly , the formation of a com - plex between Arp2 / 3 and one actin monomer , as well as addition of a second actin monomer to this complex to cre - ate a nucleus is extremely unlikely ( Fig . 11 ) . However , capture and stabilization of actin dimers or oligomers by the capping of pointed ends by the Arp2 / 3 complex is a very efficient process that can lead to the stabilization of nucleation sites for actin polymerization . We propose that a severing activity occurs after stimulation that rap - idly generates actin oligomers stabilized by the Arp2 / 3 ( Fig . 11 ) . A likely candidate for this severing activity is cofilin , which can generate severed filaments with free barbed ends . Cofilin activity is regulated by pH as well as its phos - phorylation status , the phosphorylated form being unable to bind actin . Chemotactic peptides and PMA in neutro - phils , as well as growth factors in epithelial cells , induce a dephosphorylation of cofilin that is associated with a shift of cofilin into F - actin—rich areas at the cell periphery . This suggests that cofilin could be a major component in gener - ating nucleation activity after stimulation ( Moon and Drubin , 1995 ; Nagaoka et al . , 1996 ; Aizawa et al . , 1997 ; Djafarzadeh and Niggli , 1997 ; Heyworth et al . , 1997 ) . Re - cently , the kinase that turns off cofilin activity has been identified as LIM kinase - 1 . Moreover , some data suggest that LIMK - 1 is a component of the small , GTP protein rac signal transduction pathway leading to lamellipodia for - mation in fibroblasts ( Arber et al . , 1998 ; Yang et al . , 1998 ) . We have evidence that cofilin is recruited at the edge of the lamellipodia in MTLn3 cells after EGF stimulation ( Chan , A . , personal communication ) and that expression of a constitutively active LIMK - 1 in those cells abolishes the EGF - stimulated increase in nucleation activity and subsequent lamellipod extension ( Zebda , N . , personal communication ) . Altogether , these results suggest that co - filin could have a major role in generating a transient in - crease in nucleation activity after EGF stimulation , by sev - ering the filaments to create small actin oligomers with free barbed ends that would be stabilized by Arp2 / 3 com - plex to generate nucleation sites for actin polymerization ( Fig . 11 ) . On the other hand , we cannot exclude the possibility that only a subset of the Arp2 / 3 complex at the membrane is transiently activated to nucleate actin filaments . This could explain why we observed a relatively low increase in Arp2 / 3 concentration at the leading edge after stimulation compared with the increase in nucleation activity . Indeed , it has been suggested that the Arp2 / 3 complex could be ac - The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 145 , 1999 344 tivated in vivo by different partners , which would greatly enhance its nucleating activity ( Zigmond , 1998 ) . Welch et al . ( 1998 ) have reported previously that the bacterial protein ActA could have such an effect . More recently , Machesky and Insall ( 1998 ) described two mammalian proteins , Scar1 and WASP , that interact with the Arp2 / 3 complex to regulate the actin cytoskeleton . Further work is required to decipher the sequence of molecular interactions that lead to actin polymerization and leading edge advance , and determine which mechanism allows the Arp2 / 3 com - plex to influence the outcome of these processes .
