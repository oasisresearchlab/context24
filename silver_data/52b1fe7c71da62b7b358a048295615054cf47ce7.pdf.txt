Walther 1 , 5 , 8 , 9 and Robbie Loewith 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 9 The plasma membrane delimits the cell , and its integrity is essential for cell survival . Lipids and proteins form domains of distinct composition within the plasma membrane . How changes in plasma membrane composition are perceived , and how the abundance of lipids in the plasma membrane is regulated to balance changing needs remains largely unknown . Here , we show that the Slm1 / 2 paralogues and the target of rapamycin kinase complex 2 ( TORC2 ) play a central role in this regulation . Membrane stress , induced by either inhibition of sphingolipid metabolism or by mechanically stretching the plasma membrane , redistributes Slm proteins between distinct plasma membrane domains . This increases Slm protein association with and activation of TORC2 , which is restricted to the domain known as the membrane compartment containing TORC2 ( MCT ; ref . 1 ) . As TORC2 regulates sphingolipid metabolism 2 , our discoveries reveal a homeostasis mechanism in which TORC2 responds to plasma membrane stress to mediate compensatory changes in cellular lipid synthesis and hence modulates the composition of the plasma membrane . The components of this pathway and their involvement in signalling after membrane stretch are evolutionarily conserved . Sphingolipids localize mostly in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane and play a role in maintaining its barrier function 3 , 4 . Sphingolipid abundance is controlled by feedback mechanisms that regulate the activity of sphingolipid biosynthetic enzymes to achieve homeostasis of lipid composition in the membrane 5 . The sensing mechanism detecting changes of sphingolipids in the plasma membrane is yet unknown .

The rapamycin - sensitive TORC1 regulates and is regulated by ribosome biogenesis in a product inhibition feedback loop 7 . The rapamycin - insensitive TORC2 supports growth by enhancing sphingolipid synthesis 2 , but the regulation of this kinase complex , through feedback loops or otherwise , is unknown , although a combination of sterol and sphingolipid defects has been shown to reduce TORC2 activity 8 , implicating a control through lipid homeostasis . To assess TORC2 activity , and thus begin to determine whether it is regulated by sphingolipid levels , we measured the signal intensity on western blots probed with an antiserum generated to detect phosphorylation of the TORC2 target site T662 of the kinase Ypk1 ( Fig . 1a and Supplementary Fig . S1a – c ) . Ypk1 is one of two paralogues crucial for transduction of TORC2 signals to regulate sphingolipid synthesis 2 . The sphingolipid synthesis pathway of yeast 9 is amenable to genetic andpharmaceuticalinhibition ( Fig . 1b ) . Myriocin ( Myr ) inhibitsserine palmitoyltransferase ( SPT ) catalysing the first and committing step of sphingolipid synthesis and treatment of cells strongly reduced phytoceramide ( PHC ) levels , as well as inositolphosphoceramide ( IPC ) and mannosyl - inositolphosphoceramide ( MIPC ) levels within minutes . In contrast , aureobasidin A ( AbA ) , which inhibits synthesis of complex sphingolipids , reduced only IPC and MIPC levels within this time frame . Neither drug strongly affected the levels of mannosyl - di - inositolphosphoceramide ( M ( IP ) 2 C ) ( Fig . 1c ) . Both Myr and AbA stimulated TORC2 activity , evident by increased levels of Ypk1 T662 phosphorylation ( Fig . 1d ) , whereas TORC1 activity , as assessed by monitoring the TORC1 - specific hydrophobic motif phosphorylation of Sch9 ( ref . 10 , 11 ) , was unaltered by these treatments ( Fig . 1d and Supplementary Fig . S1c , d ) . The Myr - or AbA - induced increase of Ypk1 T662 phosphorylation was specifically mediated by TORC2 ( Fig . 1e ) and not by inhibition of a phosphatase ( Supplementary 542 NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 14 | NUMBER 5 | MAY 2012 © 20 1 2 M a c m ill a n P ub li s h e r s L i m i te d .

Each of the biological triplicates was measured six times and mean values and s . d . are presented . PHC - C , IPC - C and MIPC - C levels in treated cells are signiﬁcantly ( ⇤ P < 0 . 05 , two - tailed Student’s t - test ) altered at both 30 and 60min time points with respect to levels in the untreated control ( t = 0min ) . ( d ) Pharmacological inhibition of sphingolipid synthesis activates TORC2 , but not TORC1 . Cells were treated with Myr and AbA for the indicated times and phosphorylation of Ypk1 T662 and Sch9 T737 was monitored . ( e ) Ypk1 T662 phosphorylation following sphingolipid synthesis inhibition is mediated by Tor2 . Ypk1 T662 is not phosphorylated during AbA treatment in cells harbouring a tor2 1 deletion or expressing a non - functional tor2 W2469A , W2473A mutant . ( f ) Genetic interference with complex sphingolipid synthesis activates TORC2 , but not TORC1 . Ypk1 T662 and Sch9 T737 phosphorylation was assayed in cells harbouring the indicated gene deletions ( see b ) . ( g ) Overexpression of Slm1 from the GAL1 promoter triggers TORC2 activation . ( h ) Slm proteins are required for TORC2 activity . slm2 1 slm1 - 2 ts cells exhibit reduced TORC2 activity , particularly after being shifted to the non - permissive temperature . ( i ) Slm proteins act upstream of Ypk kinases . Expression of hyperactive YPK2 D239A rescues growth of a slm2 1 slm1 - 2 ts strain at the restrictive temperature ( e . v . , empty vector ) . ( j ) Slm proteins are required for TORC2 activation following sphingolipid synthesis inhibition . Fig . S1e ) . Neither did it require activation of the flippase kinases Fpk1 / 2 ( Supplementary Fig . S1f ) , which have been proposed to be activated by reduced sphingolipid levels and may have antagonized Ypk function 12 . We also assessed TORC2 activity in yeast strains harbouring mutations in genes encoding enzymes of sphingolipid synthesis ( see Fig . 1b ) . With the exception of a mutant impairing the last step of the pathway ( conversion of MIPC to M ( IP ) 2 C catalysed by Ipt1 ) , all sphingolipid synthesis mutants examined showed elevated TORC2 activity ( Fig . 1f ) . Collectively , these observations show that reduction of sphingolipids , most likely IPC and MIPC , triggers an increase in TORC2 activity towards Ypk1 . Slm1 and Slm2 proteins have previously been implicated in TORC2 signalling and in the regulation of sphingolipid levels 13 – 16 , prompting us to investigate whether these paralogues transduce sphingolipid signals to TORC2 . Indeed , overexpression of Slm1 induced Ypk1 T662 phosphorylation ( Fig . 1g ) whereas loss of Slm function in slm1 ts slm2 1 cells at the non - permissive temperature reduced the level of Ypk1 T662 phosphorylation ( Fig . 1h ) and caused lethality . We examined whether lethality of slm1 1 slm2 1 double mutants is due to their failure to activate TORC2 . Expression of a hyperactive YPK2 allele ( YPK2 D239A ) , known to rescue lethality of TORC2 mutants 17 also rescued the lethality of slm1 ts slm2 1 cells at the non - permissive temperature ( Fig . 1i ) . Moreover , the level of Ypk1 T662 phosphorylation was no longer increased by AbA treatment in slm1 1 slm2 1 cells ( Fig . 1j and Supplementary Fig . S1g ) , providing further evidence that the effect of AbA is transduced to TORC2 by Slm proteins . It is unlikely that TORC2 activity is regulated by its protein levels , which remain stable under conditions where Slm protein function is abolished ( Fig . 2d and Supplementary Fig . S3 ) . Previously , Slm proteins have been implicated in calcineurin signalling 13 – 16 , but calcineurin seems not to be involved in TORC2 activation induced by inhibitionofsphingolipidsynthesis ( SupplementaryFig . S1h ) . Consistent with a recent report , we found the localization of Slm proteins 18 , but not TORC2 or Ypk1 ( Supplementary Fig . S2a , b ) , in distinct plasma membrane domains to be strikingly altered by Myr or AbA treatment ( Fig . 2a , b ) .

S2c ) . Furthermore , it forms less - bright plasma membrane foci that do not co - localize with either eisosomes or membrane compartments containing Pma1 ( MCPs ; ref . 21 ; Supplementary Fig . S2c ) . Time - lapse total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) experiments demonstrated that both pools of Slm1 are highly dynamic and proteins quickly exchange between them ( Fig . 2c and Supplementary Movies S1 and S2 ) . Following Myr or AbA treatment , Slm1 – GFP localized away from eisosomes ( Fig . 2a , b ) . TORC2 activity was not required for this relocalization ( Supplementary Fig . S2d ) . Co - immunoprecipitation experiments revealed increased physical association between Slm1 , TORC2 and Ypk1 during Myr or AbA treatment coincident with the release of Slm1 from eisosomes ( Fig . 2d , e and Supplementary Fig . S2e ) . Consistently , the level of co - localization between Slm1 – 2 ⇥ RFPmars and TORC2 ( marked by Avo3 – GFP ) was significantly increased by 18 % over steady - state levels of co - localization during AbA treatment ( Fig . 2f , g ) , indicating that release from eisosomes increases the pool of Slm proteins that is available to bind and activate TORC2 . It has been suggested that activation of TORC2 stimulates ceramide synthesis through Ypk kinases 2 . As TORC1 is part of a feedback loop regulating protein synthesis , we examined whether TORC2 plays a similar role for lipid regulation . A strong prediction from this feedback model is that Ypk inhibition , similarly to sphingolipid synthesis inhibition , could increase TORC2 activity and phosphorylation of Ypk1 T662 . To test this model , we generated an analogue - sensitive 22 variant of Ypk1 ( ypk1 L424G ) that is specifically inhibited by the ATP analogue 1 - NM - PP1 ( Supplementary Fig . S2f ) . As predicted , inhibition of Ypk1 caused an increase in the level of TORC2 - mediated T662 phosphorylation and the release of Slm1 from eisosomes ( Fig . 2h , i and Supplementary Fig . S2g , h ) . 544 NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 14 | NUMBER 5 | MAY 2012 © 20 1 2 M a c m ill a n P ub li s h e r s L i m i te d . A ll r i gh ts r ese rv e d .

( a ) Schematic illustration of rapamycin ( Rap ) - mediated anchoring of Slm1 – FRB to Sur7 – 2 ⇥ FKBP12 at eisosomes . In untreated cells , Slm1 – FRB ( violet ) dynamically relocalizes to and from eisosomes ( upper panel ) . Irreversible binding of rapamycin ( orange ) to FRB and FKBP12 domains serves to lock Slm1 – FRB with the transmembrane protein Sur7 – FKBP12 ( green ) at eisosomes ( lower panel ) .

Representative optical top sections are shown . Inlays depict magniﬁed regions of interest of Slm1 ( left ) , Sur7 ( middle ) and overlay ( right ) . Scale bar , 5 µ m . ( c ) Anchoring Slm1 – FRB to eisosomes ( Sur7 – 2 ⇥ FKBP12 ) is lethal . Serial dilutions of control cells and cells harbouring the indicated genetic modiﬁcations were spotted on YPD plates or plates containing rapamycin . ( d ) Anchoring Slm1 to eisosomes is lethal but can be rescued by the expression of hyperactive YPK2 D239A . The asterisks in c and d stand for TOR1 - 1 fpr1 1 slm2 1 . ( e ) Rapamycin - mediated anchoring of Slm1 to eisosomes diminishes TORC2 activity . ( f ) Anchoring of Slm1 to eisosomes impairs TORC2 activation following sphingolipid synthesis inhibition . Together , these observations might indicate that Slm proteins relocating from eisosomes following sphingolipid synthesis inhibition activate TORC2 – Ypk1 signalling . A prediction of this hypothesis is that Slm proteins sequestered in eisosomes cannot activate TORC2 . To test this , we engineered a strain that allows inducible anchoring of Slm1 to eisosomes 23 . Specifically , we used rapamycin to trigger irreversible interaction of Slm1 tagged with the FKBP12 - rapamycin - binding ( FRB ) domain of human mTOR and the transmembrane eisosome component Sur7 tagged with the FK506 - binding protein ( FKBP12 ; Fig . 3a ) . In the absence of rapamycin , Slm1 – FRB – GFP behaved similarly to the wild - type GFP - tagged protein , co - localizing with eisosomes and relocalizing following AbA treatment ( Fig . 3b ) . In the presence of rapamycin , however , Slm1 – FRB – GFP localized exclusively to eisosomes and this localization remained unaltered during AbA treatment ( Fig . 3b ) . Anchoring of Slm1 – FRB – GFP to eisosomes was lethal ( Fig . 3c ) , but the phenotype was rescued by expression of hyperactive YPK2 D239A ( Fig . 3d ) . Despite TORC2 remaining intact ( Supplementary Fig . S3 ) , eisosome anchoring of Slm1 decreased basal phosphorylation of Ypk1 T662 ( Fig . 3e ) and diminished the increase in Ypk1 T662 phosphorylation normally observed following AbA treatment ( Fig . 3f ) . On the basis of these observations , we suggest that , in unstimulated cells with normal sphingolipid levels , low levels of Slm1 in the non - eisosomal pool are sufficient to support basal TORC2 activity . Following inhibition of sphingolipid synthesis , release of Slm from eisosomes increases the binding of Slm to TORC2 and thus stimulates TORC2 activity and downstream sphingolipid synthesis . This feedback loop contributes to the return of sphingolipid levels to the homeostatic conditions of the plasma membrane . Finally , we investigated whether TORC2 activation is specific to membrane stress induced by inhibition of sphingolipid synthesis or whether other changes in the physical state of the plasma membrane can also trigger TORC2 activation . In nature , yeasts often face fluctuations in the osmolarity of their external milieu . An acute drop in osmolarity results in a marked increase in turgor pressure and consequently in plasma membrane stretching . To recapitulate this experimentally , we acclimatized yeast cells to growth in medium containing 1M sorbitol . In striking resemblance to Myr or AbA treatment , subsequent shift to sorbitol - free medium resulted in an increase in Ypk1 T662 phosphorylation ( Fig . 4a , b ) . This effect was even more pronounced in fps1 1 cells , which lack the main glycerol efflux channel and thus have a delayed recovery to hypo - osmotic NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 14 | NUMBER 5 | MAY 2012 545 © 20 1 2 M a c m ill a n P ub li s h e r s L i m i te d .

( j ) Schematic illustrating the role of eisosomes , Slm proteins and TORC2 in plasma membrane homeostasis . Plasma membrane stress , due to membrane stretch or inhibition of sphingolipid synthesis , triggers the exit of Slm1 ( violet ) from eisosomes and thus increases the pool available to associate with and activate TORC2 ( blue ) towards Ypk1 T662 ( green ) . Ypk1 in turn phosphorylates Orm proteins ( orange ) and thus antagonizes their ability to repress serine palmitoyl transferase activity , the rate limiting enzyme for sphingolipid production . Subsequent increase in sphingolipid production ultimately restores plasma membrane homeostasis and thus re - equilibrates eisosomal Slm1 pools . shock ( Fig . 4c ) . This increase in Ypk1 T662 phosphorylation was dependent on Slm proteins ( Fig . 4d ) and correlated with the release of Slm1 from eisosomes ( Fig . 4e ) . These observations strongly imply that stretching of the plasma membrane by osmotic changes activates TORC2 signalling . To test this model directly , we examined whether mechanical stretching of the yeast plasma membrane by aspiration into a micropipette causes release of Slm1 from eisosomes . To access the plasma membrane , we removed the cell wall by enzymatic digestion and maintained cell - wall - free spheroplasts in osmotically supported medium . Although eisosomes present as fewer , elongated structures in spheroplasts , Slm1 – TORC2 – Ypk1 signalling , as determined by Ypk1 T662 phosphorylation , and Slm1 relocalization capacity are not compromised ( Supplementary Fig . S4a , b ) . Before mechanical stretch , Slm1 – GFP co - localized with eisosomes ( Fig . 4f and Supplementary Movies S3 and S4 ) . Aspiration of plasma membrane into a micropipette with a 5kPa suction pressure caused fast redistribution of Slm1 – GFP away from eisosomes ( Fig . 4f – h and Supplementary Movie S4 ) . In contrast , Slm1 – GFP remained co - localized with eisosomes in all cells aspirated with a very small suction pressure ( 0 . 1kPa ; Fig . 4f , g , i ) . These dataindicatethat , similarlytosphingolipiddepletionandhypo - osmotic stress , direct mechanical interference with plasma membrane tension elicits release of Slm from eisosomes , a mechanism through which it caninprinciplebecomeavailabletoactivateTORC2kinasefunction . 546 NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 14 | NUMBER 5 | MAY 2012 © 20 1 2 M a c m ill a n P ub li s h e r s L i m i te d . A ll r i gh ts r ese rv e d . L E T T E R S Our results reveal a physiological regulation of TORC2 by Slm proteins during the cellular response to plasma membrane stress . In this model ( Fig . 4j ) , membrane stress induces redistribution of Slm proteins from eisosomes to trigger formation of a highly dynamic and probably short - lived TORC2 activation complex containing Ypk1 , initiating a feedback loop leading to sphingolipid production and resolution of plasma membrane stress . Phosphorylation of the Orm proteins plays a key role in the feedback regulation of serine palmitoyltransferaseactivity 5 , 24 , andconsistentwiththishypothesisand arecentstudy 25 , Orm1washyperphosphorylatedduringMyrtreatment inaYpk1 - activity - dependentfashion ( SupplementaryFig . S5a – c ) . We reason that eisosomes act by sequestering Slm proteins . Another Ypk activating kinase , Pkh2 , may also be regulated by protein relocalization 26 , which might indicate that sequestration of signalling moleculesisageneralfunctionofplasmamembraneorganization . Membrane stress induced by mechanical stretch also activates TORC2 in mammalian cells as determined by an increased level of phosphorylation of the hydrophobic motif in Akt ( ref . 27 ) ( the orthologous residue to Ypk1 T662 ) . How mTORC2 is activated in this mammalian response is unknown , but we propose that plasma membrane domains similar to eisosomes are involved . Caveolae , invaginated plasma membrane domains , may serve as membrane reservoirs , which disassemble following membrane stretch to reduce membrane tension and to release proteins potentially triggering downstream signalling 28 . Although mechanistic details remain to be elucidated , caveolin - 1 , the defining protein of caveolae , has , intriguingly , been implicated in stretch - induced phosphorylation of Akt ( refs 29 – 31 ) . ⇤ METHODS Methods and any associated references are available in the online version of the paper at www . nature . com / naturecellbiology Note : Supplementary Information is available on the Nature Cell Biology website ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The authors are grateful to R .

Antibodies . For both Ypk1 phosphorylated at T662 and Sch9 phosphorylated at T737 , rabbit polyclonal antiserum was raised against the corresponding phosphopeptide and affinity purified ( Eurogentec ) . Specificity of the antibodies ( 1 : 250 – 1 : 500 ) was confirmed as shown in Supplementary Fig . S1a – d . The following antibodieswerealsoused : goatanti - Ypk11 : 1 , 000 ( yl - 15 , SantaCruzBiotechnology ) , rabbit anti - HA 1 : 1 , 000 ( Y - 11 , Santa Cruz ) , rabbit anti - GFP 1 : 1 , 000 ( FL , Santa Cruz ) , mouse anti - Pgk1 1 : 2 , 000 ( Invitrogen ) and the appropriate HRP - conjugated secondary antibodies 1 : 10 , 000 ( all Santa Cruz ) . Protein techniques and interaction studies . For the immunodetection of phosphoproteins , 6 % TCA was directly added to exponentially growing yeast cultures and cells were incubated for 5min on ice before collection . Extracts were prepared as described previously 10 and proteins were resolved on a 7 . 5 % SDS gel and blotted on nitrocellulose membrane . Immunodetection was performed using the indicated antibodies . For co - immunoprecipitation experiments , protein extracts from yeast cells grown in SC media to D 600nm = 0 . 6 were prepared in lysis buffer ( 10mM sodium phosphate at pH7 . 2 , 100mM NaCl , 2mM EDTA , 1 % NP - 40 , protease and phos - phatase inhibitor cocktail ( Roche ) , 2mM dithiothreitol and 1mM phenylmethyl sulphonylfluoride ) byusingabeadbeaterandzirconiumbeads . Thesolubleprotein extracts were adjusted to the same protein concentration and incubated with 50 µ l magnetic GFP beads ( Miltenyi ) for 1h at 4   C . The beads were washed twice with 1ml lysis buffer and once with 500 µ l salt buffer ( lysis buffer containing 300mM NaCl ) . Proteins bound to the magnetic beads were eluted with 60 µ l 75   C hot elution buffer ( 2 ⇥ LDS sample buffer ( NuPAGE ) , 50mM dithiothreitol and 5 % beta - mercaptoethanol ) and heated for 10min at 75   C before SDS – PAGE . The separated proteins were transferred to PVDF membrane and immunodetection was performed using the indicated antibodies . Signal intensities were measured withImageJ ( http : / / rsb . info . nih . gov / ij / index . html ) andquantificationandstatistical analysis ( 2 - tailed Student’s t - test ) were performed in Excel ( Microsoft ) . For the analysis of Orm1 phosphorylation , cell extracts were prepared and proteins resolved on Phos - tag SDS – PAGE ( 7 . 5 % acrylamide resolving gel containing 50 µ MMnCl 2 and 25 µ M Phos - tag acrylamide ; Wako Chemicals ) as described previously 5 . Fluorescence microscopy . Cells were grown at 30   C in SC medium to D 600nm = 0 . 5 , mounted on coverslips coated with concanavalin A ( Sigma ) and immediately imaged either with a laser - based spinning - disc microscope ( Andor - TiLL - Agilent ) as previously described 1 , or a TIRF microscope ( TiLL ) using a ⇥ 100TIRFM objective ( NA = 1 . 45 , Olympus ) and a further ⇥ 2 magnification , or a spinning - disc microscope assembled by 3i ( Goettingen ; microscope : Nikon Ti Eclipse ; spinning disc : Yokogawa ; camera : Andor Ixon ; micromanipulator : MP 285 , Sutter Instruments ) using a ⇥ 100 objective ( NA = 1 . 3 , Nikon ) . FRAP experiments were performed with the TIRF set - up . When different conditions were compared for one experiment , identical microscopic settings were used . Image processing and quantification . For analysis of the FRAP experiment , the mean fluorescence intensity was measured in the indicated regions of interest of raw images using ImageJ . All other images were deconvoluted using Huygens Software ( http : / / www . svi . nl / HomePage ) and background was subtracted . For quantification of Slm1 – GFP foci , optical top sections of cells were recorded and deconvoluted . The same threshold was used for each channel in all tested conditions to create binary images . Binary masks were overlaid to an RGB image and all yellow ( Slm1 – GFP co - localizing with Lsp1 – RFPmars ; = 4pixel ) and all green ( non - co - localizing ; = 4pixel ) foci were counted manually using the ImageJ plug - in Cell Counter ( http : / / www . macbiophotonics . ca / imagej / ) . The percentage of total Slm1 – GFP foci co - localizing with Lsp1 – RFPmars was calculated with Excel ( Microsoft ) . Experiments were done in independent triplicates and average values and standard deviations were calculated in Excel ( Microsoft ) . For the analysis of the co - localization of Slm1 – 2 ⇥ RFPmars with Avo3 – GFP , optical top sections of cells imaged with the 3i spinning - disc microscope ( see above ) were used . A background image acquired before data acquisition was subtracted from each image and a Fourierband - passfilter ( 1pixel ) wasapplied . Thestandarddeviationofbackground signal ( without peak intensity ) was calculated for each channel and frame . Regions of interest containing single cells were cropped manually , and a threshold ( 4 ⇥ red background variance for Slm1 – 2 ⇥ RFPmars ; 6 . 5 ⇥ green background variance for Avo3 – GFP ) was applied . Masks of both channels were overlaid and the percentage of Slm1 – RFPmars signal co - localizing with Avo3 – GFP was quantified for n = 130 control cells and n = 345 AbA - treated cells . Statistical analysis ( two - tailed Student’s t - test ) was performed in Excel ( Microsoft ) . Plasma membrane stretch experiment .
