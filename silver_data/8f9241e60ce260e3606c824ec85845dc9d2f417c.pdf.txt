Recently , EHD1 was found to be enriched at synaptic release sites , suggesting a possible involvement in the trafficking of synaptic vesicles . We have investi - gated the role of an EHD1 / 3 ortholog ( l - EHD ) in the lamprey giant reticulospinal synapse . l - EHD was detected by immunogold at endocytic structures adjacent to release sites . In antibody microinjection experiments , perturbation of l - EHD inhibited synaptic vesicle endocytosis and caused accumulation of clathrin - coated pits with atypical , elongated necks . The necks were covered with helix - like material containing dynamin . To test whether l - EHD directly interferes with dynamin function , we used fluid - supported bilayers as in vitro assay . We found that l - EHD strongly inhibited vesicle budding induced by dynamin in the constant presence of GTP . l - EHD also inhibited dynamin - induced membrane tubulation in the presence of GTP (cid:1) S , a phenomenon linked with dynamin helix assembly . Our in vivo results demonstrate the involvement of l - EHD in clathrin / dynamin - dependent synaptic vesicle budding . Based on our in vitro observations , we suggest that l - EHD acts to limit the formation of long , unproductive dynamin helices , thereby promoting vesicle budding . Introduction Three modes of synaptic vesicle endocytosis have been sug - gested to occur at nerve terminals : clathrin - mediated endocy - tosis , kiss - and - run recapture , and bulk endocytosis ( Takei et al . , 1996 ; Clayton et al . , 2008 ; Dittman and Ryan , 2009 ; Grans - eth et al . , 2009 ; Zhang et al . , 2009 ; Hoopmann et al . , 2010 ) . However , the precise roles of these pathways remain unclear , in part due to lack of information about the molecular com - ponents used by each distinct pathway . One possible pathway - specific protein is the intramembrane lipase Rolling blackout ( Rbo ) . In a temperature - sensitive Drosophila Rbo mutant , clathrin - mediated endocytosis was found to proceed at the restrictive temperature , but bulk endocytosis was impaired ( Vijayakrishnan et al . , 2009 ) . In vertebrates , syndapin / PAC - SIN has been implicated as a specific regulator of a form of bulk membrane retrieval activated during high rates of neu - rotransmitter release ( Andersson et al . , 2008 ; Clayton et al . , 2009 ) . Syndapin contains a membrane - bending F - BAR do - main , NPF motifs , and an SH3 domain that bind proteins implicated in actin regulation and membrane remodeling ( Kessels and Qualmann , 2004 ; Braun et al . , 2005 ; Itoh and De Camilli , 2006 ) . Previous studies have documented critical roles of the SH3 interactions with N - WASP and dynamin ( Anggono et al . , 2006 ; Andersson et al . , 2008 ; Clayton et al . , 2009 ) . Less is known about the NPF motif - binding partners , which include Eps15 homology domain - containing proteins ( EHDs ) ( Braun et al . , 2005 ) . To learn more about the role of syndapin in synaptic vesicle recycling , we have begun to study these proteins . TheEHDfamilyiscomprisedoffourmembersinmammalsand a single member in Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans ( termed RME - 1 ) . EHDproteinscontainanN - terminalG - domainlinkedvia a helical region with a C - terminal EH domain . The G - domain ex - hibits structural similarity to the G - domain of dynamin but binds ATPinsteadofGTP ( Daumkeetal . , 2007 ) . TheEHdomainofEHDs preferentially binds proteins that contain acidic residues following theNPFtripeptide ( Braunetal . , 2005 ; NaslavskyandCaplan , 2011 ) . Initial functional studies have implicated EHD as a regulator of the exit from the endocytic recycling compartment ( Grant et al . , 2001 ; Lin et al . , 2001 ) . Subsequently , EHD family members have been linkedtomultiplestepsinendosomaltraffickingpathways , aswellas with other functions such as non - clathrin - mediated endocytosis of growth factor receptors and cell adhesion molecules ( Naslavsky and Caplan , 2011 ) . Recently , EHD1 was detected in nerve terminals ( Wei et al . , 2010 ) , suggesting a possible involvement in synaptic ves - icle trafficking . In mammals , EHD1 , EHD3 , and EHD4 are all ex - pressed at significant levels in brain ( Blume et al . , 2007 ; Wei et al . , 2010 ) , which complicates studies using genetic approaches .

Materials and Methods CloningoflampreyEHD . TotalmRNAwasisolatedfromlamprey ( Lampetra fluviatilis ofeithersex ) brainsusingaQuickPrepmRNApurificationkit ( GE Healthcare ) . Lamprey cDNA was constructed using an oligo ( dT ) - primer in a ThermoScript Reverse Transcriptase - PCR System ( Invitrogen ) . Sequence datafromthe Petromyzonmarinus genome - sequencingprojectwasusedfor designing primers . Full - length lamprey EHD was cloned by PCR and the product was subcloned into a pCR2 . 1 - TOPO vector ( TOPO cloning kit , Invitrogen ) . The EH domains of lamprey intersectin and lamprey Eps15 were cloned with a similar approach . The Karolinska Institute Se - quencing Core Facility ( KISEQ ) performed sequencing . Sequence align - mentwasperformedusingtheClustalWsoftware ( EuropeanBioinformatics Institute ) . Fusion proteins . Full - length lamprey EHD ( l - EHD , amino acids 1 – 537 ) , the EH domain of l - EHD ( amino acids 439 – 537 ) , the EH do - main of lamprey intersectin ( amino acids 14 – 291 ) , and the EH domain of lamprey Eps15 ( amino acids 1 – 284 ) were PCR amplified and sub - cloned into pGEX - 6P - 2 vectors ( GE Healthcare ) . The GST fusion pro - teins were expressed and purified on a glutathione coupled Hi - Trap column using standard methods ( GE Healthcare ) . For immunization , GST was removed by using PreScission protease ( GE Healthcare ) . The generations of GST - SH3 domains of lamprey endophilin and amphiphysin have been de - scribed previously ( Shupliakov et al . , 1997 ; Ringstad et al . , 1999 ) . Antibodies . The EH domains of lamprey EHD , intersectin , and Eps15 were used for im - munization of rabbits . Each polyclonal anti - body was affinity purified from serum on a N - hydroxysuccinimide Hi - Trap column with the appropriate GST fusion protein covalently linked ( GE Healthcare ) . Synaptotagmin anti - bodies were raised against the cytosolic region of rat synaptotagmin 1 ( amino acids 96 – 421 ) and affinity purified from serum . These anti - bodies reacted with a 65 kDa band in brain extracts from lamprey and rat ( data not shown ) . The generation of antibodies to dy - namin ( LD - 1 ) and VAMP2 have been de - scribed previously ( Evergren et al . , 2004a ; Jakobsson et al . , 2008 ) . Control microinjec - tions were performed with protein A - purified rabbit IgG ( Sigma ) . Western blot of lamprey tissue extracts and rat brain extracts were per - formed using standard techniques ( Jakobsson et al . , 2008 ) . Immunoprecipitation . Lamprey brain tissue was homogenized in 20 m M HEPES , 150 m M KCl , 5 m M MgCl 2 , and 10 m M EDTA , pH 7 . 40 ( IP buffer ) , with protease inhibitors ( protease inhibitor cocktail , Sigma - Aldrich ) . The ho - mogenatewasincubatedat4°Cfor1hwith1 % TritonX - 100 ( SigmaAldrich ) , andthencentri - fuged for 1 h at 45 , 000 rpm in a Ti - 70 rotor ( Beckman ) . Thesupernatantwaspreincubated for 1 h at 4°C with protein A Sepharose ( GE Healthcare ) . Three micrograms of antibodies ( EHD or control antibodies ) were incubated with 5 (cid:2) l of protein A Sepharose ( GE Health - care ) in 0 . 2 ml of IP buffer for 1 h at 4°C and then washed twice with 1 ml of IP buffer ( cen - trifugationfor5minat500 (cid:1) g ) . Twohundred microliters of protein extract or IP buffer were added to the samples and incubated for 2 h at 4°C . The bound material was isolated by cen - trifugation and washed two times with IP buf - fer (cid:2) 1 % Triton X - 100 and two times with IP buffer . Bound proteins were eluted with 2 (cid:1) sample buffer . Bound and unbound material was analyzed by SDS - PAGE as well as Western blot using standard techniques . Presynaptic microinjection . Microinjections were performed as previ - ously described ( Andersson et al . , 2008 ; Jakobsson et al . , 2008 ) . Briefly , lampreys were anesthetized with MS - 222 and the spinal cord was dis - sected and placed in a recording chamber with Ringer’s solution main - tained at 8°C . Microinjections were monitored with a cooled CCD detector ( Princeton Instruments ) . For localization studies , synap - totagmin antibodies ( conjugated with Alexa 546 , Invitrogen ) were co - microinjected with EHD antibodies ( conjugated with Alexa 488 , In - vitrogen ) . Images were obtained with a Nikon Eclipse C1 system using a 40 (cid:1) / 0 . 8NAobjective ( Nikon ) . Inperturbationexperiments , axonswere injected with EHD antibodies and were then stimulated at 5 Hz ( or , for control , maintained at rest in low - Ca 2 (cid:2) Ringer’s solution ) for 30 min and then fixed for 1 h in ice - cold 3 % glutaraldehyde / 0 . 5 % paraformal - dehyde and 4 % tannic acid in 0 . 1 M cacodylic acid buffer , pH 7 . 40 . Spinal cords were then fixed overnight at 4°C in 3 % glutaraldehyde / 0 . 5 % para - formaldehyde in 0 . 1 M cacodylic acid buffer , pH 7 . 40 , followed by 1 h postfixation in 1 % osmium tetroxide in 0 . 1 M cacodylate buffer . Fixed spinal cords were dehydrated in ethanol and embedded in Durcupan ACM . Serial ultrathin sections ( 70 nm ) were cut with an ultratome and placed on formvar - coated grids , counterstained with uranyl acetate and Figure 1 . Phylogeny of EHD proteins .

Neurosci . , September28 , 2011 • 31 ( 39 ) : 13972 – 13980 • 13973 lead citrate , and examined in a Tecnai 12 elec - tron microscope ( FEI ) . Attempts to microin - ject full - length l - EHD failed due to clogging of the micropipette , presumably due to polymer - ization of the protein . Microinjection of the EH domain of l - EHD followed by stimulation led to a massive loss of synaptic vesicles ( con - trol : 157 . 2 (cid:4) 13 . 7 ; EHD EH domain : 33 . 4 (cid:4) 3 . 9 , mean (cid:4) SEM , n (cid:3) 5 and 5 synapses ) , indi - cating a critical role of EH – NPF interactions . Further analysis of such interactions and iden - tification of the participating proteins fall out of the scope of this study . Combined microinjection – immunogold la - beling experiments were performed as previ - ously described ( Evergren et al . , 2004b ) . Axons were microinjected with EHD antibodies ( Fig . 4 ) or GTP (cid:1) S or the endophilin SH3 domain ( Fig . 5 ) , stimulated at 5 Hz for 30 min , and rapidly fixed in 3 % paraformaldehyde and 0 . 1 % glutaraldehyde in 0 . 1 M phosphate buffer ( 4 h , pH 7 . 4 ) . Longitudinal sections ( 60 (cid:2) m thick ) werecutfromtheventralsideofthespinal cords with a vibratome to make the interior of axons accessible to antibodies . Sections were la - beledwithdynaminantibodiesorEHDantibod - ies followed by incubation with gold - conjugated secondary antibodies , and embedded and ana - lyzed as described previously ( Andersson et al . , 2008 ) . Preparation of liposomes . The required lipids DOPC ( 0 . 79m M ) , DOPS ( 0 . 15m M ) , PIP 2 ( 0 . 05 m M ) , and , in the experiments with labeled membranes , RhodaminePE ( 0 . 01 m M ) were mixed in a glass tube . Afterward the lipids were dried under a stream of argon gas and kept under vacuum overnight . Before use , lipids were hydrated in 500 (cid:2) l of 20 m M HEPES and 150 m M NaCl , pH 7 . 5 , for 30 min at 37°C . Sub - sequently the solution was thawed and frozen threetimes . Thelipidswereextrudedthrougha 100 nm filter forming unilamellar vesicles . The liposome stock solution ( 1 m M ) was also used for preparation of the SUPER - template assays and was stored in the dark at 4°C for up to 1 week . For sedimentation assay , purified l - EHD proteinwasaddedataconcentrationof0 . 1m M to liposomes . The protein - lipid solution was incubatedfor60 – 90minatroomtemperature . For sedimentation , the mixture was centri - fuged in an airfuge for 60 – 90 min . The super - natant and pellet fractions were analyzed for the presence of l - EHD with SDS - PAGE and Western blot using l - EHD IgG . The amount of l - EHD in each fraction was quantified by mea - suring the intensity with ImageJ . The sum of the intensity in the supernatant and pellet frac - tions was set to 100 % , and afterward , the per - centage comprising the pellet fraction was calculated . For tubulation assay , a droplet of the protein – lipid solution was put on carbon - coated copper mesh grids ( 200 mesh ) and in - cubated 1 min before negative staining in 1 % uranyl acetate . Tubular structures were ana - lyzed in a Tecnai 12 electron microscope . SUPER template assay .

Subsequently 1 ml of H 2 O was added to the beads to wash off excess unbound lipo - somes . Beads were spun down at 0 . 5 rpm for 2 min and 1 ml of the supernatant was removed . The washing step was repeated six times , and thereafter , the beads were resuspended in the remaining 100 (cid:2) l solution . Two microliters of SUPER templates were diluted in 100 (cid:2) l of 20 m M HEPES , 150 m M NaCl , 1 m M MgCl 2 , and 1 m M nucleotide buffer and imaged on glass bottom culture dishes ( MatTek ) coated with 2 % BSA . Protein stock solutions were added to the edge of the drop of buffer . The final protein concentrations were 0 . 5 (cid:2) M . Fluorescence imaging was per - formed at room temperature on an inverted Angstrom Quorum Grid Confocal Microscope ( Leica Microsystems ) with a 63 (cid:1) ( NA 1 . 4 ) oil - immersion objective . Alexa 488 - labeled EHD was imaged with 490 nm excitation and 525 nm emission filters . For rhodamine - labeled mem - branes , 555nmexcitationand605nmemissionfilterswereused . InFigure 6 , superimposed movies sampled at 1 image / 2 s during 2 min ( A – C ) and 5 min ( D – F ) are shown . Purification of dynamin from rat brain .

Subsequently , the homogenate was centrifuged at 15 , 000 rpm for 30 min at 4°C in a Sorvall 5B centrifuge ( DuPont Instru - ments ) . The supernatant was discarded and the remaining pellet reho - mogenized in 150 ml of 20 m M Tris / HCl , 0 . 1 m M CaCl 2 , 2 m M DTT , 0 . 1 mg / ml PMSF , and 2 . 5 mg / ml leupeptin buffer , and centrifuged again for 30 min at 15 , 000 rpm and 4°C . After centrifugation , the resulting pellet was again rehomogenized in 150 ml of 20 m M Tris / HCl , 2 m M EGTA , 2 m M EDTA , 250 m M NaCl , 2 m M DTT , 0 . 1 mg / ml PMSF , and 2 . 5 mg / ml leupeptin buffer , stirred slowly for 30 min at 4°C and centrifuged for 30 min at 15 , 000 rpm and 4°C . The resultant supernatant was the dynamin extract , which was recentrifuged for 20 min at 15 , 000 rpm and 4°C to remove trace particulate material . Ammonium sulfate was then added to 35 % saturation to the extract and stirred for 30 min at 4°C . Following centrifugation for 30 min at 15 , 000 rpm and 4°C , the pellet was resus - pended in 15 ml of 200 m M NaCl , 20 m M HEPES , 1 m M DTT , 1 m M EDTA , and 0 . 1 % Tween 80 buffer and dialyzed overnight at 4°C against 2000 ml of the same buffer . The dialysate was centrifuged for 30 min at 50 , 000 rpm at 4°C in an ultracentrifuge . The supernatant was filtered througha0 . 2 (cid:2) msyringefilter ( PallLifeSciences ) . Concurrently , aGST - amphiphysin - SH3 or a GST - endophilin - SH3 column was equilibrated withthedialysisbuffer . Subsequently , thefiltereddialysatewasloadedon the column at 4°C . The column was washed with 200 m M NaCl , 20 m M HEPES , and 1 m M DTT , pH 7 . 3 . Dynamin was eluted with 6 ml of 0 . 1 M glycine , pH 2 . 8 . The protein solution was neutralized with 5 (cid:2) l of 1 M Tris , pH 9 . 0 . Fractions with the highest protein concentration were pooled and buffer was changed to 200 m M NaCl , 20 m M HEPES , and 1 m M DTT , pH 7 . 4 . Following concentration , the dynamin solution was stored in small aliquots at (cid:5) 80°C . Purity and activity of dynamin were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and Western blot as well as with the Super - template assay . Fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis . SUPER templates were diluted , 2 (cid:2) lin100 (cid:2) lof20m M HEPES , 150m M NaCl , 1m M MgCl 2 , 1m M ATP , and 1 m M GTP buffer and imaged on glass bottom culture dishes ( MatTek ) coated with 2 % BSA . Labeled protein stock solutions ( EHD - Alexa 488 ; dynamin - Alexa 546 ; dynamin PH domain - Alexa 546 ; endophilin - Alexa 488 ; GST - Alexa 488 ) were added to the SUPER tem - plates shortly before imaging . The final protein concentration was 0 . 2 (cid:2) M .

Student’s t test or the Mann – Whitney test were used where appropriate . Results A conserved EHD1 / 3 ortholog is enriched at synaptic release sites Our first aim was to determine the rela - tionship between EHDs in the river lam - prey ( Lampetra fluviatilis , a commonly used model species ) and those in other vertebrates . An EHD sequence with high - est identity to human EHD1 ( 82 % ) and EHD3 ( 83 % ) was cloned from a river lam - prey brain cDNA library . Searches within the sea lamprey ( Petromyzon marinus ) ge - nome database did not provide evidence for the presence of other EHD genes , in - dicating that lampreys contain a single EHDgene . Figure1illustratestheposition of river lamprey EHD ( termed l - EHD be - low ) in a phylogenetic tree . The l - EHD sequence clusters with high bootstrap support ( 87 ) with the tetrapod and teleost fish sequences for EHD1 and EHD3 . As the l - EHD sequence branches off before the EHD1 - EHD3 split , the tree suggests that l - EHD is an ortholog of the common ancestor of EHD1 and EHD3 . The pattern of sequence relationships with four EHD orthologs found both in tetrapods and teleosts ( and a few more recent duplicates in the latter ) may suggest that a single invertebrate EHD gene was quadrupled in the two basal vertebrate tetraploidizations before the radiation of jawed vertebrates ( Nakatani et al . , 2007 ; Putnam et al . , 2008 ) . The basic properties of l - EHD were examined in vitro . Similar to EHDs studied previously ( Daumke et al . , 2007 ; Pant et al . , 2009 ) , recombinant l - EHD bound to liposomes ( Fig . 2 A ; the pelleted fraction comprised 13 . 0 (cid:4) 1 . 6 % of the total amount in the absence of liposomes and 68 . 4 (cid:4) 18 . 8 in the pres - ence of liposomes ; n (cid:3) 3 , p (cid:6) 0 . 05 ) . Binding of l - EHD to lipid membranes was confirmed using SUPER templates ( Fig . 2 B , see also below ) . When added to liposomes , l - EHD converted them into narrow tubules ( Fig . 2 C ) . Antibodies raised against the EH domain of l - EHD reacted with a 60 kDa band ( Fig . 2 D ) that was expressed in several tissues , including brain and spinal cord ( Fig . 2 G ) . The l - EHD antibodies did not cross - react with intersectin or Eps15 , two major presyn - aptic EH domain proteins ( Fig . 2 D ) . As a further specificity test , immunoprecipitation experiments were performed . The l - EHD antibodies effectively precipitated l - EHD from brain extract without affecting the levels of intersectin or Eps15 ( Fig . 2 E , F ) . To examine the localization of l - EHD within giant reticulospinal axons , Alexa 488 - labeled l - EHD antibodies and Alexa 546 - labeled synaptotagmin antibodies were co - microinjected . The labeling of the two antibodies colocalized ( Fig . 2 H ) , thus showing that l - EHD , like EHD1 ( Wei et al . , 2010 ) , is enriched at synaptic release sites . Perturbation of EHD causes accumulation of clathrin - coated pits with elongated dynamin - coated necks The possible involvement of l - EHD in synaptic vesicle recycling was examined by using experimental conditions identical to those used in our study of syndapin ( Andersson et al . , 2008 ) . Following microinjection of l - EHD antibodies , axons were stim - ulated at 5 Hz for 30 min followed by rapid fixation . Analysis of serially sectioned synapses showed that the number of synaptic vesicles was reduced compared with stimulated control axons ( Fig . 3 A ; control204 . 4 (cid:4) 15 . 6 ; EHDIgG67 . 24 (cid:4) 11 . 81 , n (cid:3) 6and 6 synapses , p (cid:6) 0 . 0001 ) , indicating that synaptic vesicle endocy - tosis was inhibited . Unlike the case of syndapin , however , no significant accumulation of membranous cisternae was observed ( l - EHD antibodies , 10 (cid:4) 2 % ; control , 12 (cid:4) 5 % ; mean (cid:4) SD ; n (cid:3) 6 and 5 synapses ) . A further difference was that the number of coated pits at the plasma membrane in the periactive zone was significantly elevated by l - EHD antibodies ( control 2 . 06 (cid:4) 0 . 34 ; EHD IgG 6 . 02 (cid:4) 0 . 56 , n (cid:3) 6 and 6 synapses , p (cid:6) 0 . 0005 ) . These somewhat unexpected findings indicate that l - EHD , rather than participating in a bulk membrane retrieval pathway , takes part in clathrin - mediated synaptic vesicle endocytosis at the plasma membrane . The most notable finding from the EM analysis , however , was that many of the coated pits in l - EHD antibody - injected axons had elongated , tubular necks ( Fig . 3 A – C ; mean length in nm (cid:4) SEM ; control 64 (cid:4) 19 ; l - EHD IgG 91 (cid:4) 2 . 9 ; n (cid:3) 67 and 117 coated pits , p (cid:6) 0 . 0001 ) . The necks were surrounded by helix - like structures ( Fig . 3 B , arrows ) , an uncommon feature of coated pits under control conditions ( Gad et al . , 1998 ) . Such helices may contain dynamin ( Takei et al . , 1995 ) . This possibility was tested by immunogold labeling of axons cut open after microinjection of l - EHD antibodies ( Evergren et al . , 2004b ) . We found that dynamin was distinctly accumu - lated along the necks ( Fig . 4 A ) . The level of dynamin per coated pit correlated positively with the length of coated pits ( Fig . 4 B ) . Quantitative analysis showed that 98 % ( 150 of 153 ) of the coated pits with elongated necks ( coated pit length of (cid:7) 60 nm ) were labeled . To further examine a possible partner - ship between l - EHD and dynamin , another set of combined microinjection – immunogold labeling experiments were per - formed . In this case , GTP (cid:1) S and the SH3 domain of endophi - lin were used , as these compounds can trap elongated and / or Figure4 .

In axons microinjected with either of these compounds , l - EHD immunolabeling could be detected at such endocytic structures ( Fig . 5 A , B ) . In both cases , (cid:8) 45 % of the endocytic structures were labeled ( 214 of 484 in GTP (cid:1) S - injected axons ; 79 of 175 in endoSH3 - injected axons ) . In addition to the effects of l - EHD antibodies on coated pits at the plasma membrane , we noted , in a few instances , cisternae with coated structures ( Fig . 3 A , arrowhead ) . However , as men - tioned above , the number of cisternae in synaptic regions was not significantly elevated . EHD inhibits dynamin - induced vesiculation and tubulation in vitro The data presented above suggested that EHD may affect the func - tion of dynamin . To test this possibility , we monitored dynamin function in real time using fluid - supported lipid bilayers with excess membrane ( SUPER templates ) ( Pucadyil and Schmid , 2008 ) . As shown in Figure 6 A , addition of dynamin to rhodamine - labeled SUPER templates in the constant presence of GTP induced a massive burst of vesicula - tion ( mean number of vesicles / bead 26 . 7 (cid:4) 8 . 1 , n (cid:3) 3 independent experi - ments ) . When dynamin was coapplied with EHD , however , vesiculation was strongly suppressed ( Fig . 6 B ; 5 . 60 (cid:4) 0 . 99 , n (cid:3) 3 , p (cid:6) 0 . 05 ) . A similar inhibition was seen when the SUPER templates were pre - incubated with EHD before addition of dynamin . EHD alone did not induce ve - siculation ( data not shown ) . In view of recent models of dynamin function ( Bashkirov et al . , 2008 ; Pucadyil and Schmid , 2008 ; see also Discussion ) , it seemed plausible that the effect of EHD could be due either to inhibition of the assembly of dynamin into helices or to in - hibition of their disassembly . Our in vivo observations seemed to favor the former possibility . We addressed this question by modifying the experimental conditions . Long , dynamin - coated tubules can form in vitro in the presence of GTP (cid:1) S due to the fact that assembly but not disassembly can occur under such conditions ( Takei et al . , 1995 ; Zhang and Hinshaw , 2001 ; Bashkirov et al . , 2008 ) . Therefore , we added dynamin to SUPER templates in the constant presence of GTP (cid:1) S . In this case , instead of vesicles , tubular exten - sions formed from the SUPER template surface ( Fig . 6 D ; 22 . 43 (cid:4) 1 . 62 % beads with tubules , mean of three experiments ) . Such tubule formation was strongly sup - pressed when dynamin was coapplied with EHD ( Fig . 6 E , 7 . 03 (cid:4) 0 . 72 % n (cid:3) 42 , p (cid:6) 0 . 0001 ) , indicating that l - EHD indeed inhibits dynamin assembly . Control ex - periments were performed in which ATP was replaced with ATP (cid:1) S . The inhibitory effect of l - EHD on dynamin - induced ve - siculation ( Fig . 6 C , 12 . 63 (cid:4) 2 . 69 , n (cid:3) 3 , p (cid:6) 0 . 05 ) aswellastubulation ( Fig . 6 F , 16 . 61 (cid:4) 1 . 28 % , n (cid:3) 3 , p (cid:6) 0 . 0001 ) was significantly reduced under these conditions . The effect of l - EHD on dynamin function was thus not due to an unspecific increase in the protein concentration . The observations described above suggested that EHD and dynamin can interact physically . We first examined this possibil - ity with GST pulldown assays using lamprey spinal cord extract , with varying binding conditions ( different detergents , salts , and nucleotides ) . Neither full - length GST - l - EHD nor the GST - coupled EH domain of l - EHD bound dynamin at detectable lev - els ( data not shown ) . However , interactions between synaptic proteins may in some cases require a lipid environment to be - come evident ( Guan et al . , 2008 ) . This possibility was examined in FRET experiments using the SUPER templates and different combinations of labeled proteins ( Fig . 7 A – E ) . When Alexa 488 - labeled l - EHD was applied together with Alexa 546 - labeled full - lengthdynamin , aFRETsignalwasrecorded ( Fig . 7 B ) . Itsmagnitude was comparable to that induced by applying full - length dynamin together with its established binding partner endophilin ( Fig . 7 D ) . Thel - EHD – full - lengthdynaminsignalwassignificantlyhigherthan the signals detected with two negative control pairs of proteins : Figure5 .

We conclude that EHD and dynamin can come in close proximity to each other at lipid membranes ( (cid:6) 10 nm ; Taraska and Zagotta , 2010 ) . Discussion At the onset of this study , we considered the possibility that EHD might participate in a syndapin - dependent bulk membrane retrieval pathway ( Andersson et al . , 2008 ; Clayton et al . , 2009 ) . Our findings do not , however , support this hypothesis . Pertur - bation of syndapin results in massive ac - cumulation of large cisternae around release sites , but does not affect clathrin - coated pits at the plasma membrane ( Andersson et al . , 2008 ) . In contrast , we did not detect any accumulation of mem - branous cisternae after perturbation of EHD , while coated pits with an atypical morphology accumulated at the plasma membrane . These observations , along with the occurrence of l - EHD at coated endocytic intermediates , points to a role of l - EHD in clathrin - and dynamin - mediated synaptic vesicle endocytosis . The fact that we detected l - EHD labeling only on part of the endocytic structures examined ( 45 % ) may potentially be ex - plained by the existence of two parallel pathways : one EHD - independent but dynamin - dependent pathway and one de - pendent on both proteins . However , we favor the possibility of a single pathway , and that the incomplete labeling reflected a low l - EHD immunogold signal . Future stud - ies with more sensitive EHD antibodies will hopefully answer this question . Whether or not the interaction between syndapin and EHD has functional significance in nerve terminals is presently not clear . We note that many other proteins interact with EHDs ( Naslavsky and Caplan , 2011 ) . The clathrin - mediated pathway is the most well defined mechanism of synaptic vesicle recycling ( Dittman and Ryan , 2009 ) . A clathrin - coated membrane patch grows and invaginates in a process involving several accessory factors . Following forma - tion of a deeply invaginated coated pit , the neck is surrounded by a dynamin helix , which plays a critical role in membrane fission . Based on initial in vitro studies of dynamin , it was proposed that assembled dynamin helices undergo a conformational change upon GTP hydrolysis ( i . e . , upon addition of GTP ) , which causes tension in the membrane leading to fission ( Stowell et al . , 1999 ; Zhang and Hinshaw , 2001 ; Roux et al . , 2006 ) . More recent stud - ies performed in the constant presence of GTP have led to a somewhat different view of dynamin’s role in membrane fission ( Roux and Antonny , 2008 ) . Dynamin alone can drive vesicula - tion ( as confirmed here ) by accumulating at self - limited assem - blies that continuously cycle in the membrane ( Pucadyil and Schmid , 2008 ) . When applied to lipid tubes , dynamin was found to assemble into short spirals , causing narrowing of the tubes . GTP hydrolysis - driven disassembly of dynamin spirals appeared to result in an unstable state promoting membrane fission ( Bashkirov et al . , 2008 ; see also Roux et al . , 2006 ) . In contrast , long dynamin spirals formed in the absence of GTP were found to be ineffective in inducingfissionuponadditionofGTP . Whenconsideringdynamin functionincells , actionsofaccessoryproteinsthatregulatedynamin function need to be taken into account . For instance , proteins con - tainingadynamin - bindingSH3domainandaBARdomain , suchas endophilin and SNX9 , can promote assembly of dynamin at mem - branes ( Ramachandran and Schmid , 2008 ; Sundborger et al . , 2011 ; see also Takei et al . , 1999 ; Lackner et al . , 2009 ) . In accordance , perturbation of dynamin - SH3 domain interactions at synapses causes trapping of coated pits with short necks lacking dynamin helices ( Shupliakov et al . , 1997 ; Gad et al . , 2000 ; Sundborger et al . , 2011 ) . Unexpectedly , wefoundtheoppositeeffectafterperturbation of EHD ; coated pits with elongated necks surrounded by dynamin - containing material occurred at the plasma membrane . This obser - vation suggests the existence of an in vivo mechanism that acts to limit excessive assembly of dynamin helices ( Fig . 7 F ) . It thereby impliesthattheself - limitingpropertyofdynaminassemblies invitro ( Pucadyil and Schmid , 2008 ) is not sufficient to control helix length in vivo . Such an extrinsic limiting mechanism would be expected to actinbalancewiththeassembly - stimulatingfactorsdiscussedabove , as it could otherwise prevent the nucleation of helices . It is possible that the EHD - dependent mechanism is regulated such that it is not activated until after a short helix has formed . While we find it plausible that other proteins contribute to the presynaptic function of EHD , it is notable that the present in vitro tubulation , vesiculation , and FRET experiments indicate that EHD can interact directly with dynamin at membranes . How might such an interaction occur ? The precise function of EHD Figure 6 . EHD modulates dynamin function in vitro .

One possibility could be that EHD acts by sequestering dynamin at membranes , thereby coun - teracting growth of dynamin spirals . Preliminary data from ex - periments measuring the association of dynamin to membranes by FRET and FRAP are consistent with this possibility ( F . Acker - mann , L . B , unpublishedobservations ) . Anotherpossibilityisthat EHD assembles into a ring above or below the dynamin spiral to sterically limit spiral growth . This explanation appears to be con - sistent with the observation that EHD2 can form rings ( rather than helices ) on lipid tubules with a diameter corresponding to that of the neck of a coated pit ( Daumke et al . , 2007 ) . The inhib - itory effect of l - EHD on dynamin - induced vesiculation and tu - bulation was found to be relieved when ATP was replaced with ATP (cid:1) S , suggesting that cycles of ATP hydrolysis are involved . Further experiments will be required to address the mechanism behind this effect . We note that effects of nucleotides on the behavior of EHDs at membranes depend on the experimental conditions , including the EHD isoform used and the composi - tion of lipids in the assay system ( Daumke et al . , 2007 ; Pant et al . , 2009 ) . Although EHDs exhibit similarities to dynamin with re - gard to structure and membrane - stimulated nucleotide hydroly - sis , it is unclear to what extent the two proteins can be compared functionally . For instance , it is not yet clear whether EHD assem - blies undergo structural changes upon ATP binding or hydroly - sis , and the rate of membrane - stimulated ATP hydrolysis by EHD2 appears to be orders of magnitude slower than that of GTP hydrolysis by dynamin ( Daumke et al . , 2007 ) . In conclusion , we have found that a conserved , brain - expressed EHD1 / 3 - type ATPase is enriched at synaptic release sites . It associates with endocytic structures and its perturbation impairs synaptic vesicle endocytosis , leaving coated pits with long , dynamin - coated necks at the plasma membrane . Under in vitro conditions EHD1 / 3 inhibits dynamin - dependent vesicula - tion and tubulation and interacts with dynamin at membranes as indicated by FRET . We hypothesize that EHD1 / 3 acts by limiting the length of dynamin helices . As short helices are most effective in inducing membrane fission , such an influence on dynamin assembly would be expected to promote synaptic vesicle budding .
