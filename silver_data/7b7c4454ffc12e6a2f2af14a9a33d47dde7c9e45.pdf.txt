Abstract 23 Background . Human behavior , economic activity , vaccination , and social distancing are 24 inseparably entangled in epidemic management . This study aims to investigate the effects of 25 various parameters such as stay - at - home restrictions , work hours , vaccination and social distance 26 on the containment of pandemics such as COVID - 19 . 27 Methods . To achieve this , we developed an agent - based model based on a time - dynamic graph 28 with stochastic transmission events . The graph is constructed from a real - world social network . 29 The graph ' s edges have been categorized into three categories : home , workplaces , and social 30 environment . The conditions needed to mitigate the spread of wild - type ( WT ) COVID - 19 and the 31 delta variant have been analyzed . Our purposeful agent - based model has carefully executed tens 32 of thousands of individual - based simulations . We propose simple relationships for the trade - offs 33 between effective reproduction number ( R e ) , transmission rate , work hours , vaccination , and stay 34 at home restrictions . 35 Results . For the WT , it has been found that a 13 % increase in vaccination impacts the 36 reproduction number , like the magnitude of decreasing nine hours of work to four and a single 37 day of stay - at - home order . For the delta , 16 % vaccination has the same effect . Also , since we can 38 keep track of household and non - household infections , we observed that the change in household 39 transmission rate does not significantly alter the R e . Household infections are not limited by 40 transmission rate due to the high frequency of connections . For COVID - 19 ' s specifications , the 41 R e depends on the non - household transmissions rate . 42 Conclusions . Vaccination and transmission reduction are almost interchangeable . Without 43 vaccination or teaching people how to lower their transmission probability significantly , 44 changing work hours or weekend restrictions will only make people more frustrated 45 Keywords .

Household members 52 have frequent and intimate contact , making the disease spread rapidly within the households [ 4 - 53 5 ] . Developing strategies for preventing infectious diseases is a priority of health organizations . 54 There are three general containment strategies for avoiding and mitigating contagious diseases : 55 antiviral , vaccine , and non - pharmaceutical measures [ 7 ] . The non - pharmaceutical measures 56 include a wide range of policies such as changing the number of work hours , limiting 57 transmissibility between individuals by distancing measures , and stay at home ( short - term ) 58 restrictions [ 6 , 8 , 35 ] . 59 The stay - at - home policy is frequently used [ 8 - 11 ] . The World Health Organization [ 12 , 13 ] and 60 many local authorities [ 14 , 15 ] supported and encouraged stay - at - home measures . Governmental 61 policies upon stay - at - home orders are grouped into four [ 16 ] categories : no measures 62 implemented concerning staying at home , recommended to stay at home , moderate restriction 63 concerning staying at home ( people can do their daily exercise , grocery shopping , and ' essential ' 64 trips ) , and high restriction regarding staying at home ( people allowed to leave only once every 65 few days , or only one person can go at a time ) . The same countries modified the lengthy 66 lockdown to a short - term stay at home orders , such as France [ 17 , 18 ] , Turkey [ 19 , 20 ] , and India 67 [ 21 ] . These countries recommend stay - at - home orders only during weekends . On the downside , 68 stay - at - home orders , limiting work hours and distancing measures affect mental health 69 negatively , physical health , and the economy [ 36 ] . Understanding the interplay of the mentioned 70 non - pharmaceutical policies and vaccination is essential in the containment of the disease and 71 successfully managing the economy . Since the experimental study is not compliant to investigate 72 the social dynamic , control , and management of disease among humans , mathematical models are 73 crucial to quantify and investigate such effects [ 22 ] . 74 The role of stay - at - home ( short - term ) orders , limiting work hours , distancing measures , and 75 vaccination in disseminating COVID - 19 requires modelling the interplay between agents and 76 their environment . The social and spatial heterogeneity of agents and the interaction between 77 agents . These factors make it a complex phenomenon [ 70 ] . The problem can be represented by 78 agent - based models simulated on a time - resolved contact network with stochastic events . We 79 have aimed for a model where the duration of stay - at - home restrictions , number of working 80 hours , distance measures , and vaccination can be varied independently on an individual level . 81 All rights reserved .

Consequently , agent - based models are essential tools for 83 understanding the impact of human behavior in transmitting infectious diseases in different 84 environments such as households , workplaces , and social environments . Aleta et al . [ 40 ] used an 85 agent - based model with three layers : school , workplace , and household . They used their model to 86 investigate the influence of the closure of schools and stay - at - home restrictions . Another study by 87 Hoertel et al . [ 41 ] developed a stochastic agent - based model and ran it over a synthetical social 88 network . Braun et al . [ 42 ] developed a network - based , agent - based model . Using this model , they 89 simulate the synthetic Watts – Strogatz small - world network to catch the efficiency of social 90 distancing , personal protective equipment , and quarantining . Some mathematical models and 91 meta - analyses analyzed the dynamic of COVID - 19 inside and outside of households [ 23 , 6 , 24 , 92 25 , 26 , 69 ] . Many studies found that the probability of indoor transmission was remarkably high 93 compared to outdoors [ 40 ] . 94 The basic reproduction number ( R o ) indicates infectious diseases ' contagiousness or 95 transmissibility when the population is only susceptible [ 44 ] . At the same time , the effective 96 reproduction number ( R e ) estimates an epidemic ' s growth rate , which is influenced by the 97 containment strategies , herd immunity and any other factor [ 44 ] . Thus , estimates of COVID - 19 98 are not exclusively determined by the pathogen , and variability depends on local socio - behavioral 99 and environmental settings [ 45 ] . Anderson RM [ 46 ] and May RM [ 46 ] calculate the effective 100 reproduction number as a function of contacts , transmission rate , and transmission duration . We 101 used it as a measurement parameter to explore the role of stay - at - home restriction , working 102 hours , social distancing , and vaccination in the containment of COVID - 19 . 103 There have been many published works in the efforts to study the role of vaccination [ 71 ] , social 104 distancing [ 6 ] , and household [ 6 , 72 ] in understanding the dynamic and control of the SARS - 105 CoV - 2 virus . Several authors have been designed and used simple models [ 74 , 73 , 75 ] , complex 106 models [ 71 , 77 , 78 ] , and multiscale models [ 82 , 83 ] to simulate the trade - off between 107 pharmaceutical ( vaccination ) and non - pharmaceutical ( social distancing , stay - at - home restriction , 108 decrease in working hours ) intervention in the containment of COVID - 19 pandemic . This study 109 presents an agent - based model based on a time - dynamic network with stochastic transmission 110 events to analyze the interplay between pharmaceutical and non - pharmaceutical interventions . 111 We made thousands of carefully executed individual level simulations of multiscale modelling on 112 All rights reserved .

The advancement is by modelling so that the following are tunable : stay - at - 113 home restriction , working hours , vaccination , and social distancing . The simulations that were 114 made depend on four parameters . The multidimensionality of the problem hinders clear 115 understanding . We represent all our results that show the trade - offs between complex phenomena 116 in a simple mathematical expression . This simple function links the modelled forces with ( R e ) 117 from the generated data . Additionally , since we can distinguish between household and non - 118 household infections , some exciting observations include that the household infections provide 119 resilience for epidemic eradication but do not contribute significantly to spread . 120 Materials & Methods 121 Real - world Social Network Data Description and Classification 122 We use the BBC documentary Contagion to make our simulation more realistic of human 123 interaction patterns ! The BBC Four Pandemic demonstrate social network data of 469 volunteers 124 from Haslemere , England [ 84 ] . The data is not categorized as where the interactions occur . Our 125 main goal is to order each interaction , whether it occurs in workplaces , social environments , or 126 households . By classifying the edges of the graph , we can understand which of the settings and 127 behaviors of staying in that environment would affect the COVID - 19 dynamics . 128 The Haslemere dataset consists of the pairwise distances of up to 50m resolution between 469 129 volunteers from Haslemere , England , at five - minute intervals over three consecutive days 130 ( Thursday 12 Oct – Saturday 14 Oct 2017 ) . It gives users’ data for sixteen daytime hours only , 131 between 07 : 00 : 00am and 22 : 55 : 00pm , excluding the hours between 11 pm and 7 am . There are 132 576 - time points for each user . According to the 2011 UK census , volunteers of the Haslemere 133 dataset establish a sample of 4 . 2 % of the total population of Haslemere . Participants downloaded 134 the BBC Pandemic mobile phone app and then went about their daily business with the app 135 running in the background . The study was restricted to volunteers at least 16 or 13 years of age 136 with parental consent . The pairwise distances between volunteers were calculated using the 137 Haversine formula for great - circle geographic distance and are based on the most accurate GPS 138 coordinates that the volunteers’ mobile phones could provide . [ 37 , 43 ] . 139 We want to categorize this network into households , workplaces , and social environments . In 140 other words , we classify each edge and contact into three categories . We choose contacts with an 141 average pairwise distance of 20m or less , making 3245 unique contacts . Our primary analysis 142 All rights reserved . No reuse allowed without permission .

To investigate the 144 behavior of everyone during these three days , we developed a visualization method ( see 145 supplementary information Fig . S2 ) . After investigation , we developed procedures ( see 146 supplementary information Table S1 ) to categorize the network edges and contacts in the 147 household , workplace , and social environment . There are 1350 unique contacts , which occurred 148 between 1m and 5m . We use the visualization method to classify 123 , 514 , and 713 of them as 149 household , workplace , and social environment contacts , respectively . 150 We established an automated classification algorithm to classify the remaining 1895 unique 151 encounters , which occurred between 6m and 20m distances . We develop the algorithm using 152 procedures from the visualization method , see supplementary information Fig . S1 for algorithm 153 pseudocode . From 1895 unique contacts , 52 , 790 , 1003 of them occurred in the household , 154 workplaces , and social environments . We create a confusion matrix to evaluate the algorithm’s 155 performance by choosing the classified data points ( using the visualization method ) as actual data 156 and the algorithm classified data points as predicted data . Overall , 91 . 73 % of the predictions of 157 our algorithm are correct , and 8 . 27 % are wrong , according to the confusion matrix of the 158 algorithm concerning data points classified by the visualization method ( see supplementary 159 information Fig . S2 ) . The distribution of household , workplace and social environment 160 interactions after classification is illustrated in Fig . 1B . 161 162 Agent - Based Model 163 We have developed a discrete - time stochastic agent - based model , parameterized to simulate 164 distinct types of COVID - 19 outbreaks across the Haslemere data set . An agent in our simulation 165 can be in the following states : E ( t ) ( exposed ) , PS ( t ) ( pre - symptomatic , documented ) , 166 A ( t ) ( asymptomatic , undocumented ) , S ( t ) ( symptomatic , documented ) , H ( t ) ( hospitalized ) 167 and R ( t ) ( recovered ) ( Fig . 1C ) . In our model , symptomatic individuals are symptomatic 168 concerning medical records ; those who do not report symptoms are considered undocumented 169 ( asymptomatic ) . The agent - based model starts with an exposed individual . Initially , the 170 jth individual is exposed to the virus , and he / she cannot infect others during his / her latent period 171 for d1 = 2 . 7 days ( see supplementary information Table S2 ) . After the latency period finishes , 172 the jth individual ends up in one of the two branches : pre - symptomatic with a ratio of s or 173 All rights reserved . No reuse allowed without permission .

When the period of delay from the onset finishes , we generate a 174 random number ε , and there are two probabilities for the j th individual to proceed ; the first one , 175 if ε < 1 - s , he / she proceeds to the asymptomatic stage . The infectious period of the asymptomatic 176 stage is d 3 = 5 . 4 days ( see supplementary information in Table S2 ) . Through the infectious period 177 of the asymptomatic stage , when the j th individual comes in contact with the i th individual , then 178 we infect the i th individual with probability μ H Ph j , i if the edge is classified as household and μ o 179 Poj , i if non - household . The μ H and μ o are the reduction factor for asymptomatic transmission in 180 households and non - household . Ph j , i and Po j , i are the probability that j th individual 181 infects i th individual of his / her contacts in household and non - household . When the infectious 182 period of the asymptomatic stage finishes , the j th individual proceeds to the recovered stage . 183 Alternatively , the j th individual can be in the pre - symptomatic stage . The infectious period of the 184 pre - symptomatic stage is d 2 = 2 . 4 [ 49 ] . The infection probabilities are Ph j , i and Po j , i in 185 household and non - household . When the pre - symptomatic stage finishes , the j th individual 186 proceeds to the symptomatic stage and stays for d 4 = 3 days [ 50 ] . The infection probabilities are 187 the same as in the pre - symptomatic stage . When the delay period from symptomatic 188 finishes , j th individual proceeds to the hospitalization stage where he / she will recover or die . The 189 hospital stage does not necessarily mean that the agent is hospitalized . All reported cases end up 190 in the hospital stage , regardless of severity ( which is not modelled ) . The default parameter values 191 for the simulations with their sources were presented in supplementary information in Table S2 . 192 193 Constructing contact matrices and simulation with real - world social network data 194 We construct classification matrices for households , H i , j , workplaces , W i , j , and social 195 environment , S i , j , which we classified from Haslemere data . H i , j = 1 if the contact 196 of j th and i th agent occurs in a household environment , and H i , j = 0 otherwise . The simulations are 197 made for 5 minutes time step . Each contact is checked at each time step if one of the agents is 198 infectious ; also , if the other is susceptible , then it is infected by the precomputed probability . 199 There are three days in the Haslemere data : Thursday , Friday , and Saturday . Our simulations take 200 14 days , so we construct the more prolonged contact network using real data . The Weekday 201 contacts are taken from Thursday to Friday . We repeat each day sequentially and in whole . We 202 do not mix the data in a day . The weekend contacts are replicated from Saturday contacts of the 203 Haslemere data . We start the simulation with two exposed individuals . The first 14 days are 204 All rights reserved . No reuse allowed without permission .

After 14 days , we randomly chose two individuals whose states are 205 exposed , presymptomatic , asymptomatic , or symptomatic . 206 We start with a more realistic initial sample of states by this method . Then , we restart the 207 simulation for another fourteen . We calculate the effective reproduction number ( R e ) , infection 208 occurrence ratio , and secondary attack rate ( SAR ) of households from the second set of 14 - day 209 simulations . We run five hundred trial simulations for each scenario . The default parameter 210 values for the simulations were present in Table S2 . By starting with only two infected 211 individuals , we aimed that the total cases at the end of 14 days do not exceed 10 % of the total 212 population . Otherwise , the small population and repetitive use of data would have more effect on 213 the estimates . In line with our decision , even after two years , COVID - 19 cases in countries did 214 not reach a substantial percentage [ 62 ] . 215 216 Calculating infection probability ( P ) and basic reproduction number ( R o ) 217 We specify the probability that a susceptible agent i th becomes infected by a j th infectious agent in 218 a 5 - minute interval is given as a function of distance in equation ( 1 ) for household and in 219 equation ( 2 ) for non - household ( workplace , social environment ) . 220 𝑃ℎ 𝑗 , 𝑖 ( 𝑡 ) = { 𝛽 ℎ 𝑒 − ( 𝛼𝑑 𝑗 , 𝑖 ) 𝑑𝑖𝑠 𝑖 , 𝑗 ≤ 𝜃 0 𝑑𝑖𝑠 𝑖 , 𝑗 > 𝜃 ( 1 ) 𝑃𝑜 𝑗 , 𝑖 ( 𝑡 ) = { 𝛽 𝑜 𝑒 − ( 𝛼𝑑 𝑗 , 𝑖 ) 𝑑𝑖𝑠 𝑖 , 𝑗 ≤ 𝜃 0 𝑑𝑖𝑠 𝑖 , 𝑗 > 𝜃 ( 2 ) Ph j , i ( t ) is the probability of infection if the contact occurs in a household . Po j , i ( t ) is the 221 probability of infection if the contact occurs in the workplace or social environment . 222 Also , 𝑑𝑖𝑠 j , i is the distance in meters between individuals i and j at time t ; α , β h , β o are distance 223 scaling parameters , transmission probability per 5 minutes in and out of households , 224 respectively . θ defines the cutoff distance , after which the infection probability is assumed to be 225 zero . Our social network consists of a pairwise distance of up to 50m . Since we choose only 226 those interactions which occurred less than or equal to 20m , so θ = 20 . Infection probability ranges 227 between 0 and 1 . Our network consists of 102831 interactions in 5 minutes time intervals for 228 three consecutive days ( Tuesday , Friday , and Saturday ) . We calculate the infection probability 229 for each interaction separately . Effective reproduction number ( R e ) is estimated directly by 230 counting the descendants of a discovered agent after the simulation is finished , then averaged for 231 All rights reserved .

Percentage reduction of transmission probability is computed as a ratio of the effective - 232 outside transmission probability to WT ( default , estimated ) transmission rate . Thus 233 𝐷 = 𝛽 𝑜 𝛽 𝑊𝑇 100 ( 3 ) 234 Estimating Infection Occurrence Ratio 235 Throughout the simulations , we track down ancestors and descendants of infected agents . Each 236 infection pair is an edge of the classification matrices , H i , j , W i , j , S i , j . Then each classified edge is 237 calculated . 238 239 Calculating Household Secondary attack rate ( SAR ) 240 The household secondary attack rate is defined as the probability of transmission per susceptible 241 household member when a single infected individual is in the house [ 6 , 59 ] . The SAR of 242 households calculates the number of cases among contacts of primary cases divided by the total 243 number of primary cases . Our model starts the simulations with ten exposed individuals executed 244 with a daily life contact matrix to calculate the SAR of households . After that , we tract the 245 infection occurrence environments ( household , workplace , social environment ) . We identify 246 those who are members of different households . We accept those initially exposed individuals 247 who are members of different households as our primary case in each household . At the end of 248 the simulation , we calculate the SAR of each household by the following formula : 249 𝑵𝒖𝒎𝒃𝒆𝒓 𝒐𝒇 𝒄𝒂𝒔𝒆𝒔 𝒂𝒎𝒐𝒏𝒈 𝒄𝒐𝒏𝒕𝒂𝒄𝒕𝒔 𝒐𝒇 𝒑𝒓𝒊𝒎𝒂𝒓𝒚 𝒄𝒂𝒔𝒆𝒔 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑠 𝑜𝑓 𝑝𝑟𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑦 𝑐𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑠 × 𝟏𝟎𝟎 ( 4 ) 250 Calculating scaling parameters of distance ( α ) and transmission rate ( β ) of COVID - 19 251 We estimate scaling parameters of distance and transmission rate by sampling to obtain a 252 baseline Ro = 2 . 87 [ 27 ] and 0 . 46≤ SAR≤ 0 . 72 [ 34 ] , which are the basic reproduction number and 253 secondary attack rate of households of COVID - 19 , respectively . Fig . S4 in supplementary 254 information shows the sampling results for calculating α and β constants for COVID - 19 . To do 255 this , we calculate the absolute error between the estimated model R o and the exact COVID - 19 . 256 We also compute the absolute error between the estimated and the exact household SAR model 257 All rights reserved .

Finally , we add these two errors and choose α and β values that give the smallest 258 error . The estimated values are present in supplementary information in Table S2 . 259 260 Changing number of work hours during weekdays 261 We alter work hours during weekdays by changing the work edges of the network . According to 262 our classification methodology of the network , individuals work for 9 hours from 09 : 00 AM up 263 to 06 : 00 PM during weekdays . To decrease work hours from 9 hours to 9 - i ( 1≤ I ≤ 9 ) hours 264 during weekdays , we identify a home , work , and social environment edges between 06 : 00 PM 265 and 9 - i hour before 06 : 00 PM of each weekday . Secondly , we randomly change only work 266 edges with work , home , and social environment edges from edges between 06 : 00 PM and 11 : 00 267 PM of each weekday . For example , if we want to decrease work hours from 9 hours to 8 hours 268 ( i = 1 ) during weekdays . Firstly , we identify every workplace , social environment , and household 269 contact that occurred between 06 : 00 PM hour and 05 : 00 AM hour . Then we changed only 270 workplace contact with the workplace , social environment and household contacts between 06 : 00 271 PM and 11 : 00 PM . 272 273 Simulating stay - at - home restrictions 274 We have four stay - at - home restrictions scenarios : restrictions on Sunday , restrictions on Sunday 275 and Saturday , restrictions on Sunday , Saturday and Friday and restrictions on Sunday , Saturday , 276 Friday , and Thursday . After we form the 14 days of the contact network , we replace all non - 277 household ( workplace and social environment ) contacts that occurred in a 5 - minute time step 278 with a household contact that also occurred in that 5 - minute interval . 279 280 Lowering transmission probability , increasing social distancing 281 The infection probability is parameterized by two parameters , β and α . The α indicates the 282 probability of decay with the distance of contacts , whereas β is the maximum transmission 283 probability ( at a distance of 0 ) . We have obtained these parameters by sampling many 284 simulations that fit the COVID - 19’s RO and secondary attack rate . We use two β parameters , βh , 285 and βo , to distinguish between the infectiousness in households and outside . In our simulations , 286 we reduce the infectious probability to simulate a population where people reduce the probability 287 of infection by personal social distancing measures . The parameter β could be the total virus 288 All rights reserved . No reuse allowed without permission .

In contrast , α is the “loss parameter” ( due to diffusion and other 289 effects ) for distance . Thus , we have chosen to alter the parameter β on the total number of virus 290 changes when a person engages in protective measures such as wearing masks . The parameter α 291 is left untouched since the events that lead to the distance loss do not change . Alternative 292 explanations can be made ; however , this is how our simulation has been conducted . Whenever 293 we mention a reduction in infectiousness , we reduce the parameter β . So , in some simulations , we 294 alter both βh , and βo when agents at home are also engaging in personal protection ; in other 295 simulations , we change βo when agents do not engage in personal social distancing in 296 households . We have four stay - at - home restrictions scenarios : restrictions on Sunday , restrictions 297 on Sunday and Saturday , restrictions on Sunday , Saturday and Friday and restrictions on Sunday , 298 Saturday , Friday , and Thursday . After we form the 14 days of the contact network , we replace all 299 non - household ( workplace and social environment ) contacts that occurred in a 5 - minute time step 300 with a household contact that occurred in that 5 - minute interval . 301 302 Vaccination and the delta variant . 303 The simulations with delta variants use different values for β and α parameters . Again , we have 304 left α untouched . We have changed β according to the literature [ 47 ] . It is assumed that the 305 infectious probability of the delta variant is double of the wild type of virus . We have used β for 306 the delta variant as 0 . 33 , whereas the wild type was 0 . 167 . 307 The agents that are vaccinated are chosen randomly . The vaccinated agents have reduced β value . 308 We have assumed a 93 % and 88 % reduction in infectiousness for the wild type and delta variants , 309 respectively [ 48 ] . So , β for the vaccinated , wild type and delta variant is 0 . 012 and 0 . 067 , 310 respectively , whilst α is unchanged . 311 Parameters 312 General : d 1 = 2 . 7 days , d 2 = 2 . 4 days , d 3 = 5 . 4 days , s = 0 . 83 , p = 3 days , α = 0 . 9841 , μ H = 0 . 696 313 μ o = 0 . 42 , g = 192 314 Figures 2a - 2b : For the first scenario , β h = 0 . 1672 , 0 . 001 ≤ β o ≤ 0 . 1672 .

To do so , we simulate disease dynamics 325 on a real network . The network ' s edges and contacts between agents ( nodes ) are further classified 326 for the place infections . The three categories are household ( H ) , workplace ( W ) , and social 327 environment ( S ) . Furthermore , the network changes with time and the time - dependent 328 connections between agents . So , the network can be modified by changing the place of infection . 329 For example , social environment edges on weekends can be replaced with household edges , 330 indicating that the agent stayed at home . Furthermore , the change can be made in a specific time 331 interval . For example , the agent ' s work edges on Monday 4 - 6 pm are converted to household 332 edges , indicating he went home after 4 pm . 333 After constructing the network and the tools for alteration , we first investigated how three 334 environments contribute to disseminating the disease on an unaltered network . In that analysis , 335 we also vary the social distancing parameter . Secondly , we investigate the effect of stay - at - home 336 orders on weekends . Thirdly , we investigate all parameters together : change of work hours , 337 vaccination , stay - at - home orders , and social distancing . 338 Estimating Infection Occurrence Ratio in The Household , Workplace and Social 339 Environment 340 It is vital to know where the infections occur depending on the effective reproduction number 341 ( R e ) . Here , we count the infection occurring in three environments : households , work , and social . 342 Our agent - based model simulates R e by independently varying household and non - household 343 transmission rates β h , β o , respectively . People do not conduct social distancing in their homes [ 6 ] . 344 To simulate this phenomenon , we reduce the total transmission rate by decreasing the non - 345 household transmission ( β o ) while fixing the household transmission rate β h . Squares with a line 346 in Fig . 2a show R e ' s dependence on varying β o when β h is constant . Additionally , triangles with a 347 All rights reserved . No reuse allowed without permission .

The latter 348 simulations are made to assess the effect of making the distinction between β o and β h . 349 Interestingly , until R e < 1 , Re does not depend on the decrease of β h . Only after R o < 1 further 350 decreasing in β h decreases R e more than when β h is kept at its maximum . 351 The household , workplace , and social environment infection occurrence ratio has been counted 352 for R e ( for real networks ) . Overall , the household infections are dominant when R e < 1 and most of 353 the infections occur in the social environment when R e < 2 . 5 . 354 We capture the only difference between Fig . 2b ( β h kept constant ) and Fig . 2c ( β h decreases ) was 355 in the slight increase of household infection occurrence ratio when β h was kept constant , R e < 1 . 356 At R e < 1 , the infections ' environments do not change significantly . These results are further 357 supporting the results in Fig . 2a . The decrease in household transmission rate only affects the 358 dynamics at low R e . 359 Additional simulations have been made with random networks . Two separate results are plotted : 360 1 ) the range of β o and β h are the same with the real - network , line with circles in Fig . 2a ; 2 ) the 361 maximum R e is taken as the 2 . 87 ( same as the maximum of the real - network ) , line with diamonds 362 in Fig . 2a . 363 For case 1 , the random networks show much higher R e . Except , when the transmission rate is 364 reduced by more than 88 % , the random network shows lower R e than the simulations with the 365 real network ( β h fixed ) , Fig . 2a . Thus , the real network used is limited by the number of unique 366 connections . The interactions are more clustered and local . On the other hand , the frequency of 367 interactions among the selected agents is significantly higher . 368 R e ' s decreasing is much faster than the real networks ( Fig . 2a ) . Thus , decreasing Re in real 369 networks is harder and retains infection chains . 370 Overall , we speculate that the household transmission reaches its capacity at low β h due to 371 abundant link frequency . The large β h cannot lead to an increase in R e value among the infections 372 in the household . Therefore , the household transmission contributes to the resilience of the 373 eradication but does not contribute significantly to the overall spread . 374 The way we investigate the impact of human behavior on the household , workplace , and social 375 environment can be generalized to other infectious disease epidemics . MERS [ 1 ] is an infectious 376 disease that first appeared in Saudi Arabia in September 2012 . Basic reproduction number ( R o ) 377 for the MERS has ranged from 0 . 42 to 0 . 92 [ 78 , 79 , 80 , 81 ] . In 2017 , a cluster of the MERS was 378 All rights reserved .

According to our results ( Fig . 2a ) , since R e < 1 for the MERS , most 380 infections have occurred in households , which is in line with earlier work . It may also be noted 381 that household infections can increase the resilience of eradication but do not significantly 382 contribute to the spread . 383 384 Estimating Contribution of Household and Non - Household in Stabilizing of COVID - 19 385 To better understand the effect of Household and non - household transmission on the spread of 386 disease , we study the transmission chain of infections . In the earlier results , Fig . 2 , we counted 387 the place of infections in the transmission chain , namely , the household ( H ) , social environment 388 ( S ) , and workplace ( W ) . This can be regarded as the 0 th order knowledge on the transmission 389 chain—we first group S and W to non - household transmission ( O ) to get further information . We 390 then study the third - order knowledge by counting three consecutive places of infections , e . g . , 391 HOH ( the first infection is in Household , the infected person infected another person in O , and 392 that person infected another person in H ) . 393 There are eight combinations of H and O : HHH , HHO , HOH , HOO , OHH , OHO , OOH , OOO . 394 The combination OOO is dominant for Ro at 2 . 87 , the default case Fig . 3 . HHH is the least 395 frequent . Thus , a decrease in β o affects the OOO - chain three times , whereas β h has a minor 396 influence . Therefore , the spread of the disease ( Ro at 2 . 87 ) on our real network depends much 397 more sensitively on β o than β h . 398 Similar analysis can be made for the real network when R e = 1 , β h is fixed or not . The combination 399 OOO is significantly lower . The combinations with Hs are much more frequent . Therefore , the 400 system becomes more sensitive to β h . 401 Besides the real - world network , a random network was also simulated for R e at 2 . 87 . For the 402 correct comparison , the number of H and O edges is kept the same in random and real networks . 403 The number of H connections is more than O connections . It is natural to assume that infections 404 should occur more frequently on H - edges . Indeed , At R o = 2 . 87 , the frequencies of the 405 combinations are the opposite for the random networks and the real network , Fig . 3 . The 406 combination of OOO dominates the real network , while the HHH is the highest random network . 407 The discrepancy is that the unique pairs for H connections are scarce , but their frequency is 408 significantly higher . 409 All rights reserved .

In contrast , when the β decrease , the infection at O 411 diminishes faster than H because the high frequency of connections for the H - edges provides a 412 higher infection probability . 413 414 Calculating The Influence of Stay - at - home Restriction During Weekends in the Spread of 415 COVID - 19 416 After investigating the effects of contagion probability , we have investigated the effect of stay - at - 417 home restrictions on weekends . To understand the impact of stay - at - home restriction versus 418 transmission probability , we have simulated three cases : free weekend without restrictions , 419 restriction on Sunday , and restriction on Saturday and Sunday . We have simulated each 420 restriction scenario when social distancing is applied in the workplace and social environment ( β h 421 fixed ) . The edge frequencies of the altered networks are given in supplementary information Fig . 422 4a , Fig . 4b , and Fig . 4c . As detailed in the methods , the household edges replace the social 423 environment edges to implement the weekend restrictions . 424 We have found that stay - at - home restrictions during the weekends cause a decrease in R e . Figure 425 5a shows that R o drops from 2 . 95 to 2 . 71 for restrictions on Saturdays and to 2 . 56 when 426 restrictions are on Saturdays and Sundays . Fig . 5b , Fig . 5c , Fig . 5d show the ratio of infection 427 occurrence ratio for increasing R e when implementing stay - at - home restrictions during weekends . 428 When stay - at - home restrictions increase , the social environment ' s infection decreases , and work 429 infections increase . 430 Expectedly , decreasing the social environment edges decreases infections in the social 431 environment . However , the increase in household edges does not increase the number of 432 household infections due to saturation . Overall , it leads to a decrease in R o [ 59 - 60 ] . 433 434 Estimating Impact of the Daily Working Hours , Stay - at - home Restriction and 435 Transmission Reduction Level During Weekends and Weekdays on COVID - 19 . 436 The subsequent alteration to the network is on working hours . We alter working hours by 437 changing working edges . For example , if the working hours decreased from nine to eight hours , 438 the work edges between 5 pm to 6 pm are converted to a sample from the edges between 6 pm to 439 All rights reserved .

The edge frequencies of the altered networks are given in 440 supplementary information Fig . 6a , Fig . 6b , Fig . 6c , Fig . 6d , and Fig . 6e . 441 The last alteration is the vaccination . Different vaccination levels have been simulated . At the 442 beginning of the simulations , a certain percentage of randomly selected individuals are 443 vaccinated . 444 We simulate combinations of different vaccination levels , working hours , social distancing 445 measures ( transmission probability ) , and weekend restrictions : thirty thousand simulations were 446 made . The number of parameters hinders us from understanding the interplay of parameters . One 447 would like to understand the following functions Re WT ( DW , SDM , SH , Vac ) , Re delta ( DW , SDM , 448 SH , Vac ) , where DW is the decrease in working hours , the SDM is the social distancing measure , 449 the SH is the stay - at - home restriction ( in weekends and in weekdays ) , Vac is the vaccinated ratio . 450 Plotting for all simulations is hindered due to the multidimensionality of the results . Deducing a 451 closed - form solution is also almost impossible . Instead , we wanted to approximate the solutions 452 by fitting a multidimensional linear surface ( Taylor expansion ) . 453 𝑅𝑒 𝑊𝑇 = 𝛼 0 + 𝛼 1 ∙ 𝐷𝑊 + 𝛼 2 ∙ 𝑆𝐻 + 𝛼 3 ∙ 𝑉𝑎𝑐 + 𝛼 4 ∙ 𝑆𝐷𝑀 ( 5 ) 𝑅𝑒 𝑑𝑒𝑙𝑡𝑎 = 𝛽 0 + 𝛽 1 ∙ 𝐷𝑊 + 𝛽 2 ∙ 𝑆𝐻 + 𝛽 3 ∙ 𝑉𝑎𝑐 + 𝛽 4 ∙ 𝑆𝐷𝑀 ( 6 ) The linear surfaces yielded a poor fit . A nonlinear dependence is clearly observed when the data 454 is plotted against varying SDM . The mathematical expressions are updated semi - intuitively by 455 introducing non - linearity for SDM . The mathematical expression is designed so that the fit 456 parameters will allow us to understand the trade - offs between the DW , SH , and Vac . 457 𝑅𝑒 𝑊𝑇 = ( 𝛼 0 + 𝛼 1 ∙ 𝐷𝑊 + 𝛼 2 ∙ 𝑆𝐻 + 𝛼 3 ∙ 𝑉𝑎𝑐 ) ∙ √1 − 𝑆𝐷𝑀 ( 7 ) 𝑅𝑒 𝑑𝑒𝑙𝑡𝑎 = ( 𝛽 0 + 𝛽 1 ∙ 𝐷𝑊 + 𝛽 2 ∙ 𝑆𝐻 + 𝛽 3 ∙ 𝑉𝑎𝑐 ) ∙ √1 − 𝑆𝐷𝑀 ( 8 ) The expressions are valid for the range of the simulations , 0 to 4 hours for the DW , 0 to 3 for the 458 SH , 0 to 0 . 9 for the Vac ( 90 per cent vaccination ) , and 0 to 1 for the SDM . The scatter plots for 459 the simulated and estimated values are given in Figures 7a - 7b . The coefficients of determination 460 are 0 . 9697 , and 0 . 9756 for WT and delta variant , respectively . After rearranging the equations 7 461 and 8 , the expressional relations are as follows : 462 𝑅𝑜 𝑊𝑇 = 2 . 73 ∙ ( 1 − 0 . 0125 ∙ 𝐷𝑊 − 0 . 072 ∙ 𝑆𝐻 − 0 . 54 ∙ 𝑉𝑎𝑐 ) ∙ √1 − 𝑆𝐷𝑀 ( 9 ) 𝑅𝑜 𝑑𝑒𝑙𝑡𝑎 = 3 . 66 ∙ ( 1 − 0 . 015 ∙ 𝐷𝑊 − 0 . 074 ∙ 𝑆𝐻 − 0 . 35 ∙ 𝑉𝑎𝑐 ) ∙ √1 − 𝑆𝐷𝑀 ( 10 ) According to equations 5 and 6 , the trade - offs are easily measured . Changing working hours has 463 a minor effect for both the WT and delta variants , while vaccination has the most effect . More 464 All rights reserved . No reuse allowed without permission .

In comparison , one day of restriction is equal to 13 . 3 % vaccination . For the delta 466 variant , the effect of the decrease in working hours and weekend restrictions act the same , while 467 one day of restriction is equal to 20 % per cent of vaccination . However , the relative effect of 468 vaccination is 20 % less effective than the WT . 469 It is important to note that the validity of functions is limited to the simulated ranges of 470 parameters . Of course , full vaccination is expected to lower R e below 1 . However , this is not the 471 case for functions in equations ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) . This is expected because our simulated range is 0 to 472 90 per cent . After 90 % vaccination Re depends non - linearly on Vac until reaching R e = 0 . The 473 same discussion can be done for other parameters as well . 474 The SDM ( transmission probability ) varies from 0 to 100 per cent , unlike other parameters . As 475 seen in Fig . 2a , the reduction in transmission probability reduces Re significantly after an 80 % 476 reduction . The square root function approximates the non - linearity . However , at the limit of SDM 477 near 0 , Vac is 0 , DW is 0 , and the SH is 0 , the SDM dependence has a coefficient of - 0 . 5 from 478 the Taylor expansion . The effect of SDM at the mentioned limit is close to that of the 479 vaccination . 480 The parameters that we have simulated , DW and SH , vary marginally . For example , DW 481 ( Decrease in Work hours ) only changes from 0 to 4 hours . In terms of working hours , the DW 482 varies from 9 hours to 5 hours of work . In the simulated range , R e is not significantly affected . 483 Perhaps simulating for the remaining hours , from 9 to 0 hours of work , would show the non - 484 linearity that we have suspected . However , the point we want to make is that a marginal decrease 485 in working hours ( several hours ) leads to a minimal decrease in R e . The working hours must be 486 decreased substantially to decrease Re significantly . However , its burden on economic activity 487 would be profound . 488 The range for SH ( stay - at - home restrictions ) has been simulated from 0 to 4 days . The 489 meaningful range is 0 to 2 days , the weekend . 2 days of restrictions are equal to 26 % vaccination 490 for the WT , 42 % for the delta type . However , it should be noted that the simulations on the delta 491 variant with 90 % vaccination and weekend restrictions have about R e = 2 as the delta variant 492 starts with a higher R e . The weekend restriction on the wild type is more meaningful . The 493 simulations with 90 % vaccination with weekend restrictions have R e = 0 . 98 . 494 All rights reserved .

Also , 500 valuable numerical deductions are made on complex models [ 54 , 55 ] . Here , we have performed 501 complicated simulations on the real network . This network is also inherently heterogeneous . 502 Understanding the numerical solutions is troublesome when there are many parameters . We have 503 guessed a simple mathematical expression for the whole simulation to circumvent that problem . 504 Indeed , the results can be approximated with a simple form . The simple functions allowed us to 505 compare the decrease in working hours , weekend restrictions , vaccination percentage , and the 506 decrease in transmission probability ( social distancing measures ) . 507 First of all , the restrictions can be added to each other . All measures are worth considering . 508 However , any measure that is not taken to almost completion does not significantly affect the 509 outbreak . This means that at least one measure must be performed to its maximum level . Mixing 510 marginal effects would not be strong enough so that R e = 1 . For example , the required reduction 511 in transmission probability for R e = 1 is 86 % . With weekend restrictions , it only decreases to 512 82 % . Worse off , the required reduction of 3 hours the working hour is 85 . 5 % . Vaccination and 513 transmission reduction are almost interchangeable . Thus , our simulations show that changing the 514 working hours or weekend restrictions will only make people more frustrated without vaccination 515 or teaching people how to lower their transmission probability significantly . 516 There are some areas for improvement in our work . The children under thirteen were not 517 included in this data [ 32 ] . Children play a crucial role in bringing infection into the household 518 [ 33 ] . Since there are only three days of data , we reuse the data five times . We tried to decrease 519 the effect of this by only performing brief simulations . Simulations last for 14 days , and we only 520 allow for a maximum of around twenty infections per simulation . We recommend for social 521 network data miners increase their sample size during data collecting from a population . It is 522 important to note that our results depend heavily on the real - world network . We claim that our 523 results are correct on our real - world network . 524 525 All rights reserved .

In this respect , an 528 agent - based model based on a time - dynamic real network with stochastic transmission events has 529 been constructed . The network has been successfully categorized into the household , workplace , 530 and social environment . 531 The conditions needed to mitigate the spread of wild - type COVID - 19 and the delta variant have 532 been analyzed . Complicated simulations have been performed by our agent - based model on the 533 real network . The results of simulations have been interpolated with a simple form . 534 Consequently , the interplay between pharmaceutical and non - pharmaceutical intervention in the 535 containment of COVID - 19 has been investigated . 536 The computed results showed that the restrictions could be added to each other . All measures are 537 worth considering . Vaccination and transmission reduction are almost interchangeable . Our 538 simulations have been shown that without vaccination or teaching people how to lower their 539 transmission probability significantly , changing work hours or weekend restrictions will only 540 make people more frustrated . 541 This study reassures us to investigate the influence of human behavior , economic activity , 542 vaccination , and social distancing by using a more realistic network . The real network that has 543 been used in this study does not include children under thirteen . We also recommend for social 544 network data miners increase their sample size during data collecting from a population . 545 References 546 [ 1 ] Liu J , Xie W , Wang Y , et al .
