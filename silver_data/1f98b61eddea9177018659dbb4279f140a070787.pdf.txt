Here , we 17 devised a novel pipeline combining self - supervised deep learning and transfer learning to generate a 18 Neuronal Organellomics Vision Atlas ( NOVA ) . Analyzing over 1 . 5 million confocal images of 24 distinct 19 membrane - bound and membrane - less organelles in human neurons , we enable a simultaneous 20 evaluation of all organelles . We show that organellomics allows the study of cellular phenotypes by 21 quantifying the localization and morphological properties embodied in multiple different organelles , 22 using a unified score . We further developed a strategy to superimpose all organelles , which represents 23 a new realization of cellular state . The value of our approach is demonstrated by characterizing specific 24 organellar responses of human neurons to stress , cytoplasmic mislocalization of TDP - 43 , or disease - 25 associated variations in ALS genes . Therefore , organellomics offers a novel approach to study the 26 neuro - cellular biology of diseases . 27 3 Highlights 28 29 AI - driven organellomics without cell segmentation or multiplexed imaging . 30 31 Analysis of 24 membrane - bound and membrane - less organelles in more than 1 . 5 million images of 32 human neurons . 33 34 Quantitative organelle - level description of neuronal response to chemical and genetic perturbations . 35 36 Organelles ranked on a single metric scale and integrated organellome view via superposition of 37 multiple organelles . 38 4 Keywords : AI , computer vision , deep learning , machine learning , self - supervised learning , variational 39 autoencoder , neurons , neurodegeneration , subcellular architecture , organelles , biomolecular 40 condensates , inter - organellar interdependency . 41 5 Introduction 42 Organellomics , the systematic study of subcellular organellar architecture ( the organellome ) , may be 43 a useful strategy to directly phenotype cells by their subcellular compartments . This is conceivable 44 since the quantification of RNAs , lipids , metabolites and proteins that compose organelles cannot be 45 directly translated into complex organelle properties . Furthermore , organelles are interconnected by 46 functional crosstalk and inter - organelle interdependency ( Gottschling and Nyström 2017 ; Zung and 47 Schuldiner 2020 ) , further supporting the value of organellomics - level insights for cell biology . 48 The analysis of multiple organelles poses substantial challenges because of the variety of localizations 49 and morphologies , which need to be integrated and evaluated in parallel . Systematic quantification 50 and global evaluation of subcellular architecture has been developed using mass spectrometry - based 51 approaches ( Itzhak et al . 2017 ; Borner 2020 ; Schessner et al . 2023 ; Itzhak , Schessner , and Borner 2019 ; 52 Thul et al . 2017 ) . These do not provide insight about organellar morphology and depend on tedious 53 organelle fractionation , which is limited to only a subset of the organelles . In addition , imaging - based 54 approaches were developed ( Kobayashi et al . 2022 ; Spitzer et al . 2023 ; Carpenter et al . 2006 ; Heinrich 55 et al . 2021 ; Lu et al . 2019 ; Husain et al . 2023 ; Long , Yang , and Shen 2020 ) . However , these are largely 56 in non - polarized cultured cells . 57 Additionally , the study of cellular organization has been traditionally focused on membrane - restricted 58 organelles , such as the nucleus and mitochondria . However , in recent years , certain biomolecular 59 condensates have been identified as membrane - less organelles with specialized functions ( Hirose et 60 al . 2022 ; Banani et al . 2017 ; Brangwynne 2013 ; Lyon , Peeples , and Rosen 2021 ; Alberti and Hyman 61 2021 ) . Therefore , the study of both membrane - restricted and membrane - less organelles is important 62 for gaining a comprehensive view of cellular biology . 63 Accordingly , dysfunction of organelles is a central driver of disease . Disorders of membrane - bound 64 organelles such as mitochondria , lysosomes , or autophagosomes have been comprehensively 65 characterized and are associated with distinctive clinical pictures ( Platt et al . 2018 ; Cox and Cachón - 66 González 2012 ; Gorman et al . 2016 ; Schapira 2006 ; Levine and Kroemer 2008 ; Mizushima and Levine 67 2020 ) . In addition , compelling evidence suggests a role for membrane - less organellar dysfunction in 68 neurodegeneration ( Nedelsky and Taylor 2019 ; Alberti and Dormann 2019 ; Alberti and Hyman 2021 ) . 69 We hypothesized that comprehensively capturing the localization and morphological patterns across 70 the entire organellome will allow inference about the relationships between different organelles and 71 shed light on inter - organellar biology in disease phenotypes . To test this hypothesis , we employed an 72 image representation learning approach , particularly based on deep variational autoencoders , which 73 allows the capturing of high - level abstraction of morphological features from immunofluorescent 74 confocal images ( Long , Yang , and Shen 2020 ; F . Wang and Wei 2022 ; Kobayashi et al . 2022 ; Thul et al . 75 2017 ; Cho et al . 2022 ) . Widely used approaches to extract features from images require a - priori 76 assumptions about objects to be studied ( Bray et al . 2016 ; Stirling et al . 2021 ) . However , deep 77 representation learning enables automatic feature extraction , which is unbiased and does not require 78 a pre - defined object or task , hence can describe any localization pattern in the image . 79 Here , we introduce a N euronal O rganellomics V ision A tlas ( NOVA ) , a systematic and unbiased 80 organellomics approach that is based on a self - supervised Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoder 81 6 technique ( VQ - VAE - 2 , ( van den Oord , Vinyals , and Kavukcuoglu 2017 ; Razavi , van den Oord , and 82 Vinyals 2019 ) ) . NOVA takes as input immunofluorescence images of a panel of cellular organelles in 83 cultured cells , and encodes for subcellular localization patterns . NOVA builds on “Cytoself” , a model 84 trained on massive amounts of OpenCell data ( Cho et al . 2022 ; Kobayashi et al . 2022 ) . We applied 85 transfer learning on the pre - trained Cytoself model for generalization and compatibility with highly 86 polarized human neuronal cells . NOVA does not require detection of the cellular borders 87 ( segmentation ) , overcoming a limitation in neuron image analysis ( Kim , Son , and Palmore 2015 ; Ascoli , 88 Donohue , and Halavi 2007 ; Oberlaender et al . 2007 ) . Furthermore , we associate organelles with 89 unique spectral signatures that enable capturing neuronal cellular states and variable genetic 90 backgrounds . We further developed “synthetic superposition” , an in - silico technique for integrating 91 the organelle - level data to detect subtle differences in cellular architecture that are not observable by 92 examining a single organelle . 93 Organellomics reveals the heterogeneity of cell types and conditions and is sensitive enough to depict 94 organellome changes associated with single nucleotide genetic variants . As such , it can be broadly 95 utilized to provide the foundations for a powerful diagnostic avenue in the future . 96 7 Results 97 A deep learning - based model distinguishes different cellular states 98 The complexity of the organellome in highly polarized cells , like neurons , necessitates a strategy that 99 transforms microscopic images into unbiased , quantitative data . Deep variational autoencoders are 100 generative AI algorithms , successful in encoding images into meaningful features that enable multi - 101 level ( hierarchical ) latent space representation . To analyze organellar morphology and localization 102 features ( referred to here as topography ) , we employed Cytoself , a self - supervised model for 103 subcellular localization patterns from microscopy images ( Kobayashi et al . 2022 ) . We first trained an 104 in - house Cytoself model using the Pytorch framework on the entire dataset of 1 , 311 proteins in 105 1 , 134 , 592 OpenCell image tiles of human embryonic kidney ( HEK293T ) cells that were cultured in basal 106 growth conditions ( Cho et al . 2022 ) , Supplementary Figure 1A ) . Cytoself is based on the VQ - VAE - 2 107 deep learning architecture : a two - level vector quantized variational autoencoder , which converts an 108 image into global and local numerical representations ( Methods ) . The model is trained to find a set of 109 2 , 048 abstract features ( codewords ) that are stored in a codebook , where each codeword captures 110 important morphology and localization properties of images ( Figure 1A ) . Then , a unique combination 111 of codewords is used to represent each image ( Supplementary Figure 1B - D ) . The comparison of 112 codeword usage between different conditions ( phenotypes ) provides a means for uncovering 113 quantitative organellar differences . We created means to compare specific properties of subcellular 114 localization patterns by creating uniform manifold approximation and projection ( UMAP ) of the 115 representations and by histograms of codeword frequencies , or feature spectra , following ( Kobayashi 116 et al . 2022 ) ( Figure 1A , Supplementary Figure 2B , C , Methods ) . Differential feature spectra analysis 117 further enables comparison of organellar topographies and phenotypes ( Supplementary Figure 2D , 118 see Methods ) . 119 First , we evaluated whether Cytoself could be extended beyond its initial training to effectively discern 120 cellular states in other cell lines ( Figure 1 , Supplementary Figure 1B - D ) . Thus , we cultured human 121 osteosarcoma ( U2OS ) cells and induced oxidative stress by sodium arsenite ( 30 minutes , 0 . 4 mM , 122 ( Protter and Parker 2016 ; Anderson and Kedersha 2009 ) . Stress granules ( SGs ) , a type of cytoplasmic 123 biomolecular condensate , form in response to stress conditions and are readily identifiable through 124 specific immunostaining of the protein G3BP1 ( Figure 1B ) . However , the actin cytoskeleton or P - 125 bodies ( labeled by Phalloidin , or DCP1A , respectively ) , did not display visually detectable alterations 126 ( Supplementary Figure 2A ) . Accordingly , UMAP revealed clear segregation of stressed and unstressed 127 U2OS cell clusters based on stress granule data ( G3BP1 , adjusted Rand index ( ARI ) , 0 . 943 ; Figure 1B ) 128 and feature spectra , depicted the codeword frequencies . 129 Although the human eye could not depict the effect of stress on the actin cytoskeleton or P - bodies , 130 the UMAP revealed a moderate degree of separation ( Supplementary Figure 2B , ARI < 0 . 6 ) and feature 131 spectra enables comparison of codewords used to describe the organellar topographies in stress 132 ( Supplementary Figure 2D ) . Therefore , Cytoself’s performance is robust and works well on a cell type 133 ( U2OS ) , perturbation ( stress ) , and labeling techniques ( antibodies and dyes ) that were not part of its 134 initial training . 135 136 8 Transfer learning enables detection of subcellular localization patterns in human neurons 137 While techniques for image analysis of cultured cells are available ( Carpenter et al . 2006 ) , automated 138 microscopic analysis of subcellular neuron organization remains extremely challenging . Thus , we next 139 tested whether Cytoself could be applied to induced pluripotent stem cell ( iPSC ) - derived neurons 140 ( Fernandopulle et al . 2018 ) , Figure 1C ) . Images of immune - stained neurons were captured by a 141 spinning disc confocal microscope and subjected to QC and preprocessing steps . Overall , throughout 142 this work we created a comprehensive dataset composed of > 1 , 200 , 000 image tiles of ~ 3 , 300 , 000 143 human iPSC - derived neurons ( Supplementary Figure 3A , and Supplementary Materials ) . 144 145 Upon introduction of sodium arsenite , visible SGs were assembled in neuron images ( Supplementary 146 Figure 1C ) . However , Cytoself failed to segregate stressed from unstressed neuron populations based 147 on the stress granule marker G3BP1 ( Figure 1D , upper UMAP , ARI = - 0 . 001 ) . Therefore , Cytoself ' s 148 training on HEK293T cells was insufficient for the analysis of neurons . To gain applicability to neurons , 149 we applied transfer learning to the Cytoself model ( Methods , Figure 1D ) . Transfer learning is a 150 machine learning technique where a model developed for one task ( Cytoself , protein localization in 151 cancer cells ) is reused as the starting point for a model on another task ( localization in neurons ) , 152 leveraging pre - learned patterns to improve performance . 153 For robustness , data used for training , validation , and test originated from four different batches 154 ( ~ 580 , 000 human iPSC - derived neuron image tiles ) while inference was conducted solely on the rest 155 of the batches . The new fine - tuned model was successful in correctly clustering neurons by cellular 156 stress state , using G3BP1 as a marker ( Figure 1D , lower UMAP , ARI = 0 . 821 ) . Therefore , the transfer 157 learning into the new NOVA model expands the capabilities to study human neurons . 158 9 159 160 Figure 1 : Deep learning - based representation of subcellular localization and morphological patterns 161 in non - polarized and polarized cells .

( D ) Cytoself model fails to cluster iPSC - derived neurons subjected to stress from cultures 170 under basal growth conditions ( ARI = - 0 . 001 , G3BP1 ) . A transfer learning process on neuronal images 171 established a fine - tuned model termed the NOVA - model , which effectively depicts the response of 172 neurons to stress ( ARI = 0 . 821 ) . 173 174 175 10 Organellomics : the study of 24 organelles in neurons 176 To gain a broad organellomic view , we devised a set of 24 key membrane - bound and membrane - less 177 organelles ( Figure 2A ) . We stained neurons with specific antibodies that demarcate the 24 organelles 178 ( Table 1 ) and captured spinning disc confocal images . The NOVA model allowed encoding of these 179 images and the representations were used to create a UMAP of the full landscape of neuronal 180 organelles ( Figure 2B ) . Thus , cluster proximity signifies similarity in either localization or morphology . 181 Notably , two distinct nuclear clusters emerge : one encompasses the nucleus , nucleolus and hnRNP 182 complex and the other features TDP - 43 granules , ANXA11 granules , and paraspeckles . These 183 potentially suggest distinctive nuclear substructures . Notably , the proximity of TDP - 43 and 184 paraspeckles is consistent with TDP - 43 co - localization in paraspeckles ( West et al . 2016 ; Naganuma et 185 al . 2012 ) . 186 187 Next , we analyzed feature spectra , which describe organellar topographies , following the work of 188 ( Kobayashi et al . 2022 ) . We hierarchically clustered the feature spectra , and generated ordered 189 feature histograms of each organelle ( Supplementary Figure 1C ) . The feature spectra revealed 190 distinctive organellar topographies that could be clustered into 11 groups ( clusters , Figure 2C ) . 191 Notable similarities were identified , e . g . , between nucleus and hnRNP complex or ANXA11 granules 192 and TDP - 43 granules , suggesting similar topographies . In addition , the transport machinery and 193 coated vesicles manifested a shared spectral signal that extended to the presynapse , suggesting 194 coordinated organellar topographies . The 11 clusters were manually aggregated into three families 195 ( Figure 2D ) , corresponding to punctate structures , nuclear localized organelles and 196 cytoplasmic / neuritic localized organelles ( Figure 2D , Supplementary Figure 4A ) . Taken together , 197 neuronal organellomics with 24 organelles reveals distinct localization or morphology patterns , 198 yielding biologically - interpretable feature spectra and providing insights into neuronal subcellular 199 organization . 200 201 11 202 Figure 2 : Organellomics reveals distinct topography patterns in neurons .

To test this , we first characterized the effect of sodium arsenite stress 220 on the organellome in neurons . UMAP analysis revealed differential localization or morphology 221 patterns of some of the organelles upon stress induction ( Figure 3A ) . In stress , both G3BP1 and PURA 222 converge on stress granules ( Di Salvio et al . 2015 ; Daigle et al . 2016 ; Markmiller et al . 2018 ) , consistent 223 with a significant and coordinated change in their topographies ( G3BP1 ARI = 0 . 821 , PURA ARI = 0 . 718 , 224 Figure 3A ) . In addition , PML nuclear bodies displayed altered topography ( ARI = 0 . 756 ) . These results 225 were consistently replicated in three separate batches , and suggest that the most stress - sensitive 226 organelles in neurons are stress granules ( ARI = 0 . 757 or 0 . 546 for G3BP1 or PURA , respectively ) , and 227 PML nuclear bodies ( ARI = 0 . 242 , Supplementary Figure 5A ) . 228 229 We further developed an orthogonal scoring technique to quantify organellar topographies ( organelle 230 scoring ) using the full representation ( instead of only 2 UMAP components ) . For this , we calculated 231 the Euclidean distances of the representations and ranked organelles by their ability to discriminate 232 between states ( Figure 3B , Methods ) . Organelle scoring allows direct comparison of all organelles in 233 neurons under basal and stress conditions . We found substantial alterations in the topography of 234 stress granules ( by both G3BP1 and PURA ) across eight experimental batches . This was substantiated 235 by an additional independent experimental repeat with six batches , together totaling 14 batches 236 ( Supplementary Figure 5B , C ) . Notably , the organelles that were most affected by stress were stress 237 granules and PML nuclear bodies . Reproducible stress - associated changes were also quantified in 238 TDP - 43 granules , the mitochondria , integrin puncta , autophagosomes , P - bodies and nucleoli . While 239 changes in stress granules were noticeable by a human experimentalist , all other organellar changes 240 escaped the human eye , emphasizing the value of computer - based analysis . Furthermore , organelle 241 scoring allows for relative comparison of different organelles even at distinct and physically separated 242 cellular compartments ( nucleus , cytoplasm ) or with very different morphologies . 243 244 We compared the performance of the NOVA - model to CellProfiler , an established object - based image 245 analysis technique ( Stirling et al . 2021 ) . To this end , we developed a pipeline that extracts 347 246 CellProfiler features ( Stirling et al . 2021 ) ) . Organelle ranking on the basis of CellProfiler features in 247 response to neuronal stress revealed changes in PML nuclear bodies , stress granules ( PURA ) and other 248 organelles that were consistent with the NOVA - model . However , unexpectedly , CellProfiler ranked 249 14 stress granules ( marked by G3BP1 ) as a mediocre readout of cellular stress ( Supplementary Figure 250 5D ) . Altogether , the NOVA - model reveals the broad changes neuronal organelles undergo in stress 251 and ranks them on a single scale system . While automatically extracting features , it is comparable or 252 perhaps more sensitive than an object - based approach . 253 254 To uncover coordination in responses between different organelles and identify potential 255 interorganelle regulation we next performed a differential analysis of spectral features in response to 256 stress and utilized it for network graph analysis . We identified four correlating subgroups of organelles 257 ( Figure 3C , Supplementary Figure 5E ) . One subgroup included stress granules ( PURA and G3BP1 ) , the 258 Golgi apparatus , lysosome and mitochondrial outer membrane ( MOM ) . This analysis suggests an 259 orchestrated stress response across these four organelles . The changes in the differential feature 260 spectra of these organelles are accordingly localized to a particular region of the spectrum ( Figure 3D ) . 261 The intriguing correlation of stress granule and mitochondria outer membrane suggests that 262 potentially these organelles display coordinated topographies in response to stress . We provide 263 cursory support for this hypothesis by demonstrating higher colocalization of stress granules and 264 mitochondria in U2OS cells under proteotoxic stress ( Supplementary Figure 5F , G ) . In addition , the 265 correlation of differential feature spectra of PML nuclear bodies and P - bodies , or that of nuclear 266 organelles ( paraspeckles , TDP - 43 granules , nucleoli , and hnRNP granules ) , suggests mutual behaviors 267 and potential underlying biological coordination ( Figure 3C ) . Therefore , organellomics uncovers broad 268 neuronal responses to stress that can be quantified onto a unified scale across organelles . 269 15 270 Figure 3 : A coordinated neuronal organellar response to stress .

Scale varies across organelles ( y axis ) . 278 279 Cytoplasmic TDP - 43 impacts neuronal organellar dynamics and P - body size 280 To investigate whether our organellomics approach can generate novel mechanistic insights into 281 disease states , we studied iPSC - derived neurons expressing doxycycline - inducible TDP - 43 ( TARDBP ) , 282 which lacks a functional nuclear localization signal ( NLS ; TDP - 43 deltaNLS ) leading to mislocalization of 283 TDP - 43 to the cytoplasm ( Figure 4A , B ) . TDP - 43 cytoplasmic malpositioning is a hallmark of human 284 neuropathology in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) and frontotemporal dementia ( FTD , 285 16 ( Tziortzouda , Van Den Bosch , and Hirth 2021 ) . Accordingly , we created a comprehensive dataset 286 composed of an additional 8 batches , yielding > 328 , 000 image tiles . Four of the batches were used to 287 fine - tune the NOVA - model , and the four remaining image batches were used for inference 288 ( Supplementary Figure 3A , 6A , and Supplementary Materials ) . As expected , we observed alterations 289 in TDP - 43 granule topography ( Figure 4C ) . Organelle scoring of TDP - 43 ± Dox reassuringly revealed 290 that the topography of TDP - 43 was affected by the cytoplasmic mislocalization of TDP - 43 granules 291 ( termed TDP - 43 granules 1 and 2 when immunostaining with two different N - terminal specific 292 antibodies recognizing amino acids 203 - 209 ; one monoclonal and one polyclonal antibody ( Tsuji et al . 293 2012 ) , Figure 4D , Supplementary Figure 6B , C ) . However , P - bodies , hnRNP complex , nucleoli and the 294 Golgi apparatus topographies were also altered . In contrast , no discernible changes were identified in 295 stress granules ( ranked 18th and 21st out of 24 , G3BP1 and PURA respectively ) . These findings suggest 296 that the effect of cytoplasmic TDP - 43 on the organellome is largely independent of stress granules , 297 aligning with ( Gasset - Rosa et al . 2019 ) , who observed that cytosolic TDP - 43 assemblies operate 298 separately from conventional stress granules . The strong coordinated response of TDP - 43 granules 299 and P - bodies was validated using CellProfiler , which suggests that P - body area decreased upon 300 cytoplasmic TDP - 43 induction . However , P - body numbers were unchanged ( Figure 4E , Supplementary 301 Figure 6D ) . Altogether , cytoplasmic TDP - 43 mislocalization impacts several organelles , most notably 302 P - bodies . 303 304 305 306 Figure 4 : Impact of Cytoplasmic TDP - 43 on the Neuronal Organellome .

To address this hypothesis , we developed “synthetic 320 super position” , a novel in - silico technique , that combines the representations of all organelles per 321 perturbation ( Figure 5A , Methods ) . Synthetic superposition enables a consolidated perspective on the 322 integrated organellome . This is technically gained by randomly selecting an image tile of each of the 323 24 organelles , encoding them into codeword histograms ( 2 , 048 values per organelle ) , and 324 concatenating these representations ( which yields a single vector of 49 , 152 values ) . We sought to 325 assess the effect of various perturbations on organellome superposition . The integrated organellome 326 effectively captured the impact on neurons of stress ( ARI = 0 . 893 , Figure 5B ) and of cytoplasmic 327 mislocalization of TDP - 43 ( ARI = 0 . 145 , Figure 5C ) . 328 We also asked whether our approach could be used to study organellar dysfunction in the context of 329 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) , a neurodegenerative disease with a substantial genetic 330 component . For this , we utilized iPSC - derived neurons harboring ALS - associated genetic mutations on 331 a single isogenic background , from the iPSC Neurodegenerative Disease Initiative ( iNDI , ( Ramos et al . 332 2021 ) . iNDI lines gained traction as useful tools for research and allow a controlled comparison of 333 different neurodegeneration - associated mutations . We compared the effect of homozygous ALS - 334 associated mutated genes FUS R495 * , TDP - 43 M337V , OPTN Q398E and TBK1 E696K ( Fernandopulle 335 et al . 2018 ; Ramos et al . 2021 ) versus the isogenic control line ( Wild - type Figure 5D ) . In other models , 336 FUS R495 * is depleted from the nucleus and undergoes aberrant phase separation ( Hofweber et al . 337 2018 ; Yoshizawa et al . 2018 ; Dormann et al . 2010 ) . Likewise , the TDP - 43 M337V mutation disrupts its 338 localization ( Zhang et al . 2013 ; Bilican et al . 2012 ; Mutihac et al . 2015 ) . Both TDP - 43 M337V and OPTN 339 Q398E alter vesicular trafficking ( Feneberg et al . 2020 ; Qiu et al . 2022 ) . OPTN Q398E further alters the 340 secretory pathways , causes Golgi fragmentation , dysregulated autophagosomes and enhances ER 341 stress ( Qiu et al . 2022 ) . Finally , TBK1 E696K hampers mitophagy and autophagy ( Li et al . 2016 ) . 342 The integrated organellome of the four ALS - associated genetic models and wild - type , superpositioning 343 all 24 organelles , demonstrate the differences between the cell lines and is reproducible across 344 different batches ( Figure 5E , Supplementary Figure 7A , B ) . TBK1 E696K and FUS R495 * were most 345 different from the wild - type , whereas TDP - 43 M337V and OPTN Q398E remained in the vicinity of the 346 wild - type , suggesting that their organellome is unaffected ( Figure 5E ) . 347 348 Since the topographical changes associated with FUS R495 * were pronounced , we focused on FUS . 349 The integrated organellome revealed a strong similarity between the heterozygous and homozygous 350 FUS R495 * mutants . Additionally , the revertant ( genetically restored ) line was distinct from the FUS 351 mutant clusters , yet it still did not reside near the wild - type line ( Figure 5F ) . This suggests that the 352 differences between the wild - type and the revertant are not fully recovered . 353 18 354 The hnRNP complex ( FUS ) analysis reveals FUS mutants ' clustering apart from the wild - type and 355 revertant lines . Accordingly , microscopic images reveal that hnRNP complex ( FUS ) is detected in the 356 cytoplasm of FUS R495 * heterozygous and homozygous mutants and it is constrained to the nucleus 357 in the wild - type and the FUS revertant lines ( Figure 5G , H ) . Interestingly , feature spectra of the FUS 358 R495 * mutants lines differed from that of the WT and FUS revertant lines ( Pearson correlation r = 359 0 . 11 , 0 . 08 for FUS homozygous , FUS heterozygous , respectively ) . Noteworthy , when synthetic 360 superposition was performed by combining all other 23 organelles , omitting the hnRNP complex , the 361 FUS revertant clustered closer to FUS R495 * and apart from the wild - type line ( Supplementary Figure 362 7C ) . Together , these data suggest that the hnRNP complex is the predominant organelle affected by 363 the FUS R495 * mutation , which is effectively recovered by genetic correction of the mutation . 364 However additional elements , such as the passage in culture , or CRISPR off targets , make the revertant 365 line dissimilar to the wild - type . Finally , a genetic SNCA E46K mutation that is associated with 366 Parkinson ' s Disease ( PD ) was studied . In the integrated organellome , SNCA E46K emerges as another 367 distinct cluster , suggesting that it differs from neurons with ALS - associated mutations ( Supplementary 368 Figure 7D ) . 369 Altogether , our data demonstrate that NOVA is broadly applicable as a tool for image analysis in 370 neuroscience and can facilitate neurodegeneration - focused organellomic studies in human neurons . 371 372 19 373 Figure 5 : Integrated Organellome Characterization of iNDI ALS Cell Lines .

We employ 386 deep variational autoencoder architecture , in a self - supervised strategy , to systematically encode 387 subcellular localization and morphology patterns from immunofluorescent images of 24 membrane - 388 bound and membrane - less organelles . NOVA provides an unprecedented depth to organellar 389 microscopic studies and an integrative view of cell biology . 390 We leveraged the Cytoself model that was trained on the OpenCell dataset . We applied transfer 391 learning to achieve NOVA’s capability to stud y cultured human neurons , which pose several strengths : 392 first , gaining the knowledge captured from learning localization of 1 , 311 proteins , which promotes the 393 improved performance of NOVA compared to training a model from scratch . Second , it significantly 394 reduces the time and resources needed for training . Additionally , NOVA can be the foundational 395 baseline for transfer learning in additional AI neurobiology studies , which minimizes the volume of 396 images required for subsequent inquiries . Moreover , our dataset , composed of myriads of neuron 397 microscopic images , is a valuable resource for further investigations . 398 NOVA does not require cell segmentation , which simplifies data processing and is particularly 399 advantageous when examining highly polarized cells such as neurons . 400 Importantly , the NOVA Synthetic Superposition method provides a unique way to study the whole 401 integrated organellome . Being performed in silico , therefore , NOVA is not limited by the relatively 402 small number of channels that standard light scopes are equipped with . Instead , NOVA relies on simple 403 confocal images , thus providing an inexpensive alternative to cumbersome multiplexing technologies 404 such as CODEX or 4i ( Black et al . 2021 ; Gut , Herrmann , and Pelkmans 2018 ) . Noteworthy , synthetic 405 superposition can be applied to existing microscopy datasets , without setting a limit to the number of 406 organelles . 407 Methods that generate self - explainable manual engineered features ( intensity , shape , granularity , size 408 for a given object ) , such as CellPainting and CellProfiler ( Bray et al . 2016 ; Stirling et al . 2021 ) , are widely 409 used . However , some markers are not easily demarcated by defined objects . NOVA utilizes deep 410 representation learning , which is unbiased and does not require a pre - defined object or task , hence 411 can describe any localization pattern in the image . Computer vision studies have demonstrated that 412 as compared with the hand - crafted features , the multi - scale features automatically learned by a deep 413 learning model can capture and generalize better ( Singh et al . 2020 ; Caicedo et al . 2017 ; Sun , Tárnok , 414 and Su 2020 ; Lavitt et al . 2021 ) . Moreover , NOVA’s hierarchical latent spaces enable encoding complex 415 structures and provide potent representations at various ( global and local ) abstraction levels . 416 Importantly , this fast and easily implementable approach can be applied retroactively to existing 417 microscopy images , without restricting the number of markers examined in a single analysis . The ease 418 and cost - effectiveness of synthetic superpositioning , leveraging standard confocal microscopes , 419 empower users with access to such instruments to effortlessly capture images and evaluate them 420 using NOVA . 421 The relevance of organellomics studies root from the intricate network of organellar interactions , 422 which allows cells to regulate compartment content and functions ( Cohen , Valm , and Lippincott - 423 21 Schwartz 2018 ; Donahue , Ruark , and Burkewitz 2022 ; Rossini , Pizzo , and Filadi 2021 ; Schrader , 424 Kamoshita , and Islinger 2020 ) . This is not limited to membrane - bound organelles , as the intricate 425 cellular communication network extends to encompass interactions of membrane - bound and 426 membraneless organelles ( Bussi et al . 2023 ; Amen and Kaganovich 2021 ; Liao et al . 2019 ; Qin et al . 427 2023 ) and between different membraneless organelles ( Stoecklin and Kedersha 2013 ) . The dynamic 428 interplay within the cellular landscape is accordingly revealed also by the compound multi - organellar 429 dysfunction in disease conditions , e . g . , lysosome - peroxisome dysregulation in peroxisomal disorders , 430 ( Chu et al . 2015 ) or mitochondrial dysfunction in lysosomal storage disorders ( Plotegher and Duchen 431 2017 ) . 432 Our image - based organellomics approach provides a compelling alternative to traditional biochemical 433 methods of organellar fractionation ( Itzhak et al . 2017 ; Borner 2020 ; Schessner et al . 2023 ; Itzhak , 434 Schessner , and Borner 2019 ; Thul et al . 2017 ) , addressing the inherent difficulties of organelle 435 fractionation , particularly in attempting the isolation of liquid - like membraneless organelles ( Mitrea 436 et al . 2018 ) . 437 The NOVA model enables the assessment of how individual organelles respond to perturbations 438 through organelle scoring . This method facilitates direct comparisons across all organelles and 439 provides a way to prioritize them for further studies . Moreover , by capturing the responses of all 440 organelles , it unravels the complete cellular response in a manner previously unachievable , paving the 441 way for evaluating organellar coordination and potential interdependencies . 442 We demonstrate the utility of NOVA via the study of neuronal response to oxidative stress . The 443 observed expected changes in stress granules were accompanied by the response of several other 444 organelles to stress that had been previously overlooked . Thus , stress triggers a coordinated response 445 involving not just stress granules , but also the mitochondrial outer membrane , lysosomes , and the 446 Golgi apparatus . The hypothesized interaction between the mitochondrial outer membrane and stress 447 granules was further experimentally validated and visualized . We also induced cytoplasmic TDP - 43 , 448 which is a model of ALS ( Tziortzouda , Van Den Bosch , and Hirth 2021 ) . In our study , the significant 449 alteration in P - body topography was the most clear change associated with cytoplasmic localization 450 of TDP - 43 . Therefore , the interaction of TDP - 43 granules and P - bodies might be an important facet of 451 biology . Intriguingly , TDP - 43 to P - bodies interactions may be largely independent of stress granules , 452 which did not change in response to the expression of TDP - 43 ( Lee et al . 2021 ; I . - F . Wang et al . 2008 ; 453 Liu - Yesucevitz et al . 2010 ; Gasset - Rosa et al . 2019 ) . 454 A key achievement of our study is the integrated organellome approach for cellular states , which is 455 performed by superimposing the topographic information of multiple or even all organelles . We 456 demonstrate the utility of the integrated organellome in a study of several ALS - associated genetic 457 models and focus primarily on FUS R495 * neurons that display the most pronounced organellar 458 changes relative to wild - type controls . FUS R495 * is deficient of the nuclear localization signal and is 459 clinically associated with an aggressive , juvenile , form of ALS ( Waibel et al . 2010 ) . The changes to FUS 460 R495 * homozygous and heterozygous organellomes were extremely similar , suggesting that a single 461 mutated allele is sufficient to drive the observed phenotype . Additionally , the cytoplasmic 462 mislocalization of the hnRNP ( FUS ) complex is recovered in a revertant FUS line . However , the 463 organellome of the FUS revertant line is not fully restored and seems to exhibit some disruptions 464 22 relative to the wild - type organellome . Such partial organellar dysregulation might be due to passage 465 in culture or CRISPR off targets . 466 We cultured iPSC - derived cortical neurons for 8 days . Therefore these neurons are still rather 467 premature . It is plausible that extended culture age or chronic stress will result in additional 468 phenotypes . In this context , it is not clear if the cytoplasmic malposition of the hnRNP ( FUS ) complex 469 is an early manifestation and whether additional organelle topographies would change with longer 470 culturing time in the FUS R495 * model or in any of the other ALS - associated genetic models . We also 471 acknowledge that while the lack of segmentation makes NOVA very efficient , it is limited to studies in 472 homogenous cultures . Further development of segmentation in NOVA might allow for the study of co - 473 cultures , multiple genotypes or even tissue sections . Finally , the model is currently applicable to iPSC - 474 derived cortical neurons . We expect that the model can be fine - tuned and generalized to other 475 disease - relevant cell types . However this will require additional data collection and transfer learning 476 steps . 477 In summary , organellomics is a novel approach to understanding cellular biology . It can be extended 478 to additional disease phenotypes , to other types of patient - derived cells and to existing image data . 479 Organellomics will likely contribute additional insights to the mechanisms of neuronal diseases and to 480 the generation of novel hypotheses that can be experimentally tested . We suggest that the value of 481 organellomics for genotype - phenotype mapping can broadly impact cellular biology and disease 482 biology research and foster precision medicine for neuronal diseases . 483 484 485 23 References 486 Alberti , Simon , and Dorothee Dormann . 2019 . “Liquid - Liquid Phase Separation in Disease . ” Annual 487 Review of Genetics 53 ( December ) : 171 – 94 . 488 Alberti , Simon , and Anthony A .
