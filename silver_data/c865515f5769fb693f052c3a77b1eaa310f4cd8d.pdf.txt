Despite the e ﬀ orts to increase the target tissue distribution , the safe and e ﬀ ective delivery of siRNA to the diseased cells with su ﬃ cient cytosolic transport is another critical factor for successful RNAi clinical application . Here , the constructed lipid - based liquid crystalline nanoparticles , called nano - Transformers , can transform thestructure in the intra - cellular acidic environment and perform high - e ﬃ cient siRNA delivery for cancer treatment . The developed nano - Trans - formers have satisfactory siRNA loading e ﬃ ciency and low cytotoxicity . Di ﬀ erent from the traditional cationic nanocarriers , the endosomal membrane fusion induced by the conformational transition of lipids contributes to the easy dissociation of siRNA from nanocarriers and direct release of free siRNA into cytoplasm . We show that transfection with cyclin - dependent kinase 1 ( CDK1 ) - siRNA - loaded nano - Transformers causes up to 95 % reduction of relevant mRNA in vitro and greatly inhibits the tumor growth without causing any immunogenic response in vivo . This work highlights that the lipid - based nano - Transformers may become the next generation of siRNA delivery system with higher e ﬃ cacy and improved safety pro ﬁ les . KEYWORDS : Lipids , liquid crystalline nanoparticles , siRNA delivery , endosomal escape , synthetic lethality T he RNA interference ( RNAi ) therapy has gained the world ’ s attention and become a promising new class of medicines that can silence disease - causing genes in cancer , autoimmune disease , and genopathy . 1 − 4 To activate the RNAi pathway , small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) molecules must be delivered across the plasma membrane of the target cells and be incorporated into the RNAi machinery . 5 As the plasma membrane is semipermeable , naked siRNA molecules are di ﬃ cult to di ﬀ use across the cell membranes alone . 6 Consequently , various systems have been explored for siRNA delivery with varying levels of success in speci ﬁ c gene silencing . 7 − 9 Virus have shown high siRNA delivery e ﬃ ciency both in vitro and in vivo . 10 , 11 The low selectivity and potential safety issues , nevertheless , restrict the clinical application of viral systems . 12 , 13 In contrast , nonviral vectors such as polymers , liposomes , and dendrimers have the clear merit of better safety . 14 − 16 In particular , lipid - based nanocarriers have attracted interests for siRNA delivery due to their high biocompatibility . They are basically composed of natural or bioinspired lipid materials and have been used to silence therapeutic genes in several clinical trials . 17 − 19 It should further be noted that most nonviral systems used in academic studies and clinical trials are excessively positive - charged , which is required for e ﬀ ective siRNA condensation but will induce signi ﬁ cant systemic toxicity and lead to low cell selectivity . 20 The cationic complexes are capable of destabilizing the endosomal membrane or bu ﬀ ering the endosomal vesicle , leading to endosomal swelling and lysis , thus releasing siRNA into the cytoplasma . 21 , 22 Although many cationic siRNA delivery systems have been proved to promote decent transfection in cell culture , researches have reported that the cationic - related toxicities , such as radical - mediated pulmonary toxicity , ATPase decrease , cell autophagy , and immunogenic response , limited the broad application of cationic siRNA delivery systems in clinic . 23 − 26 In recent years , a couple of systems such as pH - sensitive charge - reversal copolymers and cationic lipid - assisted PEG − PLA nanoparticles have been reported to exhibit negative charge in the physiological environment and shift to positive charge in the acidic Received : December 27 , 2017 Revised : March 4 , 2018 Published : March 21 , 2018 Letter pubs . acs . org / NanoLett Cite This : Nano Lett .

XXXX , XXX , XXX − XXX endosomal environment , decreasing the immunogenicity during systemic circulation . 27 , 28 However , even these methods cannot completely avoid the in vivo toxicity induced by cationic materials after their endosomal escaping process . 29 In addition , di ﬃ culty in dissociation between siRNA and positive - charged materials hinders siRNA molecules to incorporate into the RNAi machinery , decreasing the overall siRNA transfection e ﬃ ciency . 30 It is signi ﬁ cantly important to develop a new generation of siRNA delivery system to improve the gene transfection e ﬃ ciency and decrease the cationic - related toxicity . 31 Some lipid molecule complexes with rational arranged structures ( gyroid cubic lipid matrix for example ) are reported to possess e ﬀ ective gene silencing . 32 , 33 Here , we synthesized an amphiphilic negative charged lipid and constructed an intelligent lipid - based liquid crystalline nanoparticle platform to improve the gene transfection e ﬃ ciency and decrease the cationic - related toxicity . Di ﬀ erent from the proton sponge e ﬀ ect , the designed nanoparticles ( also called the nano - Transformers ) exhibited endosomal environment - triggered structural transformation property , which could facilitate endosomal escape of siRNA through high endosomal membrane fusion e ﬃ ciency and directly release free siRNA molecules into cytosol . Negative to neutral surface charge allowed the nano - Transformers to avoid cellular toxicity and immunological recognition . As a proof of concept , trans - formability , safety , and other physicochemical properties were characterized ﬁ rst . Cytosolic delivery e ﬃ ciency along with the underlying mechanism was then investigated in human hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) cell line , and in vivo studies were ﬁ nally taken to assess the therapeutic e ﬀ ect and the immunological response . The present study focuses on the design of liquid crystalline nanoparticles with high e ﬃ ciency and low toxicity for siRNA delivery . In order to accomplish this , we designed a lipid material to constitute the nano - Transformers . This lipid material was obtained by linking the primary amine of dioleostearin - 3 - amino - 1 , 2 - propanediol ( DOA ) with citraconic Figure 1 .

Detailed synthesis procedures were shown in the Supporting Information and Figure S1 . Structures of both DOA and DC were veri ﬁ ed by 1 H NMR ( Figure S2 ) . As schematically illustrated in Figure 1A , DC molecules could self - assemble into DC liquid crystalline ( DCLC ) nanoparticles due to the amphiphilic property . When assessed using scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) and cryo - ﬁ eld emission scanning electron microscopy ( cryo - FESEM ) , DCLC nano - Transformers exhibited uniform needle shape with hollow interior ( upper panel in Figure 1B ) . When incubated in the acidic environment ( pH 5 . 0 PBS ) at 37 ° C , it was also found that the morphology of DCLC nano - Transformers would change into nanospheres with nodules inside ( lower panel in Figure 1B ) , and the diameter would change from 170 . 3 ± 10 . 85 nm to 286 . 1 ± 14 . 66 nm ( Figure 1C ) . Moreover , polarized pattern of DCLC nano - Transformers changed from rod - like to spot - like ( Figure S3 ) after incubation . Zeta potential of DCLC nano - Transformers increased from − 30 . 7 ± 2 . 87 to 6 . 4 ± 1 . 80 mV ( Figure 1D ) , which was close to neutral comparing with the commercially available cationic liposome Lipofectamine 2000 ( Lipo 2000 , 32 . 7 ± 3 . 41 mV ) . These results indicated a transformation process of DCLC nano - Transformers that occurred during incubation . To systematically investigate how the nano - Transformers evolve during transformation , ﬂ uorescamine was used to label the amino group of DOA , and the transformation process was monitored using a confocal microscope ( Figure 1E ) . The needle structured crystalline nanoparticles gradually disap - peared after incubation in the pH 5 . 0 PBS for the ﬁ rst 30 min . The colocalization of the ﬂ uorescamine ( blue ) signal with the nanofragments indicated that the shape transformation of DCLC nano - Transformers could be a result of the hydro - lyzation of DC to DOA . During the following 60 min , these nanofragments assembled into the spherical nanoparticles with more ﬂ uorescamine signals associated with the nanoparticles , suggesting the acidic environment triggered morphological transformation . The lipid constituent in DCLC nano - Trans - formers before and after the acidic environment incubation was further validated by 1 H NMR . It has been reported that the citraconic amide is stable in both neutral and basic pH but became unstable in acidic pH . 34 − 36 Thus , DC could degrade back into DOA under this condition . As shown in Figure 1F , two characteristic 1 H NMR peaks of DC , including methyl group and ole ﬁ nic bond of citraconic acid at δ = 2 . 1 and 6 . 1 ppm disappeared after incubation . In addition , the frame structure of 3 - amino - 1 , 2 - propanediol at 2 . 7 − 4 . 1 ppm were observed , which was coordinated to the spectrum of DOA ( Figure S2B ) . It was demonstrated that DC molecules degraded back to DOA after incubation in the acidic environment . According to the Israelachvili theory , DC and DOA molecules were expected to show cylindrical and reversed - conical conformations , respectively . 37 The geometrical change of the building blocks could explain the microstructural transformation of DCLC nano - Transformers . 38 The crystal lattice changing was then determined using small - angle X - ray scattering ( SAXS ) . With the Bragg peak of DCLC nano - Transformers ( Q a = 1 . 337 nm − 1 , consistent with the L β gel phase ) gradually decreasing in the acidic environment , two intense peaks ( Q b = 1 . 461 nm − 1 and Q c = 1 . 698 nm − 1 ) and one broad peak at approximately 2 . 087 nm − 1 then emerged ( Figure 1G ) . Since the amplitude of each peak was proportional to the quantity of relevant repeated structures in that phase , it was reasonable to conclude that the microstructural transformation occurred under this condition . In addition , similar SAXS results were obtained under the pH 6 . 0 PBS condition ( Figure S4 ) , Figure 2 . siRNA encapsulation and characterization of the DCLC nano - Transformers .

XXXX , XXX , XXX − XXX C indicating that the transformation of DCLC nano - Transformers would occur only if there were enough H + s for DC degradation . Considering that pH 5 . 0 was often used to represent the endosomal acidic environment , pH 5 . 0 PBS was then chosen for the following experiments in this study . All these results demonstrated that nano - Transformers with endosomal acidic environment - induced transforming property were successfully synthesized . Particle size of DCLC nano - Transformers was sonication - dependent ( Figure S5 ) . To optimize the formulation of DCLC nano - Transformers , various ratios of the material components were then investigated and drug loading e ﬃ ciency was used as a criterion . The ternary phase diagram of the DC / PBS / oleic oil system was shown in Figure 2A , and the blue area represented the condition of DCLC nano - Transformer growth . The broad area of DCLC nano - Transformer growth demonstrated an easy preparation , which was important for commercialization . As shown in Figure 2B , siRNA encapsulation e ﬃ ciency was promoted along with the increasing volume ratio of DC . When the ratio of DC raised to 80 % , siRNA molecules were all encapsulated ( loading yield = 50 % ) . Therefore , we chose the volume ratio of DC / PBS / oleic oil = 16 / 3 / 1 to prepare the siRNA - loaded DCLC nano - Transformers . The desirable siRNA encapsulation e ﬃ ciency of DCLC nano - Transformers was attributable to the internal hydrophilic hollow space formed by amphiphilic lipid DC . It is essential for DCLC nano - Transformers to remain stable when diluted into serum , as siRNA is vulnerable to serum nuclease after being systemically administrated . 39 Stability of DCLC nano - Transformers during dilution was investigated by measuring the size distribution and zeta potential . As shown in Figure 2C , size and zeta potential of siRNA - loaded DCLC nano - Transformers barely changed . In addition , all siRNA - loaded DCLC nano - Transformers showed similar polarized pattern during dilution ( Figure S6 ) . These results ensured the stability of siRNA - loaded nano - Trans - formers facing dilution , which might be bene ﬁ ted from the highly negative charged hydrophilic surface . Serum stability assay was taken by incubating siRNA - loaded DCLC nano - Transformers with fetal bovine serum for a series of time intervals . As shown in Figure 2D , encapsulation of DCLC nano - Transformers prolonged the time of siRNA against nuclease . Electrophoresis strip of disrupted DCLC nano - Transformers was still detectable at 12 h , but the strip of the naked siRNA molecules disappeared at 10 h . It could be explained by the hollow space inside DCLC nano - Transformers ( Figure 1B ) , which provided shelter for siRNA molecules from degradation . It has been reported that the cationic lipids will induce positive surface charge - dependent cellular toxicity and ATPase activity inhibition . 25 , 26 To investigate the safety of siRNA - loaded DCLC nano - Transformers , we measured the cell viability and cellular ATP level using HepG2 cells treated with DCLC nano - Transformers containing scrambled siRNA . Lipo 2000 - siRNA nanoparticles were used as positive control . As shown in Figure 2E and 2F , DCLC nano - Transformer group had less in ﬂ uence on both cell viability and cellular ATP level compared with Lipo 2000 group . Statistical di ﬀ erence in cell viability between the DCLC nano - Transformer group and the Lipo 2000 group appeared at a siRNA working concentration of 200 nM , and statistical di ﬀ erence in the cellular ATP level appeared at 50 nM . In addition , siRNA concentrations higher than 200 nM of Lipo 2000 group induced remarkable cellular morphology change , while the DCLC nano - Transformer group remained the same ( Figure S7 ) . All these results indicated that the anionic DCLC nano - Transformers provided a safer way for siRNA delivery , which might ensure much more reliable experimental data by decreasing the side e ﬀ ects and false positive rate . Cellular uptake is an important step for siRNA delivery . 6 We used ﬂ ow cytometry , laser scanning confocal microscopy , and super - resolution microscopy ( SRM ) to investigate the endocytosis and intracellular distribution of FAM - siRNA ( green ) in HepG2 cells . The ﬂ uorescent intensities of DCLC nano - Transformer group and Lipo 2000 group were signi ﬁ - cantly higher than free siRNA group after incubation ( Figure 3A , B ) , indicating the enhanced cellular uptake of siRNA delivered by both nanocarriers . Confocal and SRM images ( top panels in Figure 3C ) showed the colocalization of siRNA and endosomes after incubation for 30 min , and the siRNA molecules locating inside the endosomes ( red ﬂ uorescence ring ) . These results demonstrated that siRNA delivered by both nanocarriers were taken up into cells through the endocytosis pathway . The release of free siRNA molecules into cytosol is another key procedure related to overall siRNA silencing e ﬃ ciency . Successful cytosolic delivery of siRNA by DCLC nano - Transformers was shown by the separation of the green siRNA signals from red endosomal signals ( Figure 3C ) . The overlap coe ﬃ ciency of DCLC nano - Transformer group at 120 min was only 0 . 186 ( Figure 3D ) , lower than that of 0 . 264 in Lipo 2000 group , indicating that most siRNAs have escaped from the endosomal entrapment . In addition , siRNA must dissociate from its nanocarrier and release into the cytoplasma before they bind to RNA - induced silencing complex . 30 It has been found that the condensed siRNA in DCLC nano - Transformers or Lipo 2000 showed bright green spots , while the free siRNA showed di ﬀ used ﬂ uorescence ( Figure S8 ) . The e ﬃ cient delivery of free form siRNA by DCLC nano - Transformers was further validated by diminishing the green spots and the di ﬀ usion of siRNA signal in cytosol at 120 min . In contrast , siRNA molecules condensed by Lipo 2000 were still accumulated in cytosol even though escaped from endosomes ( arrows in Figure 3C ) , and the average number of siRNA clusters was signi ﬁ cantly higher than that in the DCLC nano - Transformer group ( Figure 3E ) . This could be explained by the strong electrostatic interaction between positively charged Lipo 2000 and negatively charged siRNA . Instead of using electrostatic interactions , encapsulation of siRNA into DCLC nano - Transformers took advantage of the solubility , leading to an easier dissociation of siRNA from the delivery system during endosomal escape . It was also worth mentioning that almost all siRNA failed to escape from endosomes by 120 min with the presence of the proton pump inhibitor ba ﬁ lomycin A1 ( Figure S9 ) , which hindered the endosomal acidi ﬁ cation and DCLC nanoparticles ’ transformation . This indicated that the endo - somal escape of siRNA delivered by DCLC nano - Transformers was transformation - dependent . Since only fully dissociated siRNA that escaped from endosomes could form the RNA - induced silencing complex and then bind with the downstream mRNA , siRNA delivered by DCLC nano - Transformers was thought to enable more e ﬃ cient gene silencing . Additional e ﬀ orts were devoted to characterize the endo - somal escape process in further detail by live - cell ﬂ uorescence imaging with HepG2 cells . Here , Alexa 647 - labeled dextran was added into the culture medium to label endosomes . 40 , 41 Dextran was water - soluble and membrane - impermeable . Nano Letters Letter DOI : 10 . 1021 / acs . nanolett . 7b05430 Nano Lett . XXXX , XXX , XXX − XXX D Thus , ﬂ uorescent dextran could be used in measuring the integrity of the endosomal membrane during intracellular tracing , as dextran would leak into the cytosol only if the endosomal membrane was damaged . As shown in Figure 4A and Movies 1 and 2 ( Supporting Information ) , the time - dependent appearances of the endosomes ( blue ) , siRNA ( Cy3 - labeled , red ) . and nanoparticles ( DiO - labeled , green ) were visualized in both merged and individual channels . Early , after internalization , endosomes containing siRNA - loaded DCLC nano - Transformers were visible as bright , globular ﬂ uorescent structures . Approximately 10 − 12 min after monitoring , the ﬂ uorescent signal of siRNA quickly disappeared ( red arrows ) and the integrated ﬂ uorescent density showed a signi ﬁ cant decrease ( Figure 4B , C ) , while the ﬂ uorescent signals of both dextran and DCLC nano - Transformers were still colocalized and visible . These results indicated a quick escape and complete dispersion of siRNA into cytosol without endosomal membrane rupture , which was reasonable for the membrane fusion mechanism . However , for Lipo 2000 group ( Figure 4A ) , the ﬂ uorescent signal of dextran quickly disappeared about 15 − 17 min after monitoring ( yellow arrows ) , and signals of both siRNA and Lipo 2000 were colocalized and visible after escaping from endosomes . Comparing with DCLC nano - Transformer group , the disappearance of dextran signal in Lipo 2000 group ( Figure 4D ) revealed a leakage of dextran into the cytosol , further indicating the damage of the endosomal membrane . Consistent with the results in Figure 3 , more than 50 % siRNA delivered by Lipo 2000 remained condensed in the cytosol after escaping from endosomes ( Figure 4E ) , which might decrease the transfection e ﬃ ciency of siRNA . Moreover , similar to the confocal microscopy results ( Figure S9 ) , pretreatment of the cells with ba ﬁ lomycin A1 also inhibited the release of siRNA when delivered by DCLC nano - Transformers ( Figure S10 ) , verifying that the fusion between DCLC nano - Transformers and the endosomal membrane was acidi ﬁ cation - and transformation - dependent . Overall , di ﬀ erent from the disruptive mode of escape mediated by Lipo 2000 , DCLC nano - Transformers achieved endosomal escape of siRNA through highly e ﬃ cient membrane fusion by taking advantage of the transforming process . To verify the enhanced endosomal escape was a result of promoted membrane fusion by transformation , the mimetic endosomes were prepared to visualize the fusion process . DiO - labeled DCLC nano - Transformers ( green ) containing scrambled siRNA were loaded into DiI - labeled model endo - somes ( red , composed of DOPC bilayer and PBS ) to imitate the membrane fusion process occurred inside the cell ( Figure 4F ) . Similar with the previous results , transformation of DCLC nano - Transformers ( pH 5 . 0 ) markedly facilitated the fusion with lipid bilayer , as was evident by the distribution of the green ﬂ uorescent signals along with the red signals . For the Lipo 2000 group , though nanoparticles quickly adhered to the membrane through electrostatic interactions , the di ﬀ usion of green signals was even slower than DCLC nano - Transformers without transformation ( pH 7 . 4 ) . To directly test the membrane fusion e ﬀ ect , the lysosomes isolated from HepG2 cells and siRNA - loaded nanoparticles were labeled with two ﬂ uorescence dyes that constituted a Fo ̈ rster resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) pair . As shown in Figure 4G , it was observed that DCLC nano - Transformers showed a rapid increase of ﬂ uorescence intensity at the emission wavelength around 565 nm within 60 min , indicating the excellent fusion of lysosomes with DCLC nano - Transformers . However , the fusion e ﬀ ect was partial and slow in Lipo 2000 group , indicated by the noticeable lower ﬂ uorescence intensity at 565 nm . These results indicated that the DCLC nano - Transformers were advantageous in promot - ing the membrane fusion with endo / lysosomes . Molecular dynamics simulation was used to investigate the underlying mechanisms . As shown in Figure 4H , insertion of Figure 3 . Cellular uptake and intracellular distribution of siRNA molecules .

XXXX , XXX , XXX − XXX E the DC molecule into the lipid bilayer without conformational transition ( pH 7 . 4 ) increased the free energy by Δ E 1 = 131 kJ mol − 1 of the membrane system . Notably , this free energy di ﬀ erence markedly increased to Δ E 2 = 412 kJ mol − 1 after DC degradation and conformational transition ( pH 5 . 0 ) . Since the total number of atoms did not change during this simulation , the relative energy calculated for each system was only dependent on the van der Waals interactions between the polar parts of the molecules . Changing of the molecular geometry from cylindrical to reversed - conical disturbed the arrangement of DOPC molecules and in ﬂ uenced the van der Waals interactions , resulting in the conspicuous enhancement of the relative free energy . In this way , conformational transition of DC could lead to a considerable decrease of free energy cost for membrane destabilization , which would further Figure 4 .

XXXX , XXX , XXX − XXX F accelerate the membrane fusion process and ﬁ nally facilitated the release of siRNA molecules into cytosol . After escaping from the endosomal entrapment , free siRNA molecules could combine to downstream mRNA to achieve the RNAi e ﬀ ect . Here , RT - qPCR and Western blot were used to investigate whether siRNA delivered by DCLC nano - Trans - formers could play an e ﬀ ective role . As shown in Figure 5A , treatment of HepG2 cells with DCLC nano - Transformers containing CDK1 - siRNA ( siRNA working concentration : 100 nM ) showed a 95 % reduction on CDK1 mRNA and a corresponding decrease in CDK1 protein expression , which was dramatically lower than Lipo 2000 ( approximately 50 % reduction on CDK1 mRNA ) . This remarkable gene silencing ability of DCLC nano - Transformers permitted the application in broader ﬁ elds compared to Lipo 2000 . It has been reported that elevated c - Myc expression rendered HCC cells more proliferative and synthetically lethal with CDK1 inhibition . 42 , 43 Thus , the downregulation of CDK1 protein caused by the nano - Transformers was able to kill HCC cell line HepG2 more e ﬀ ectively and spare normal cells . Cell cycle and apoptosis after treating with nanocarriers containing CDK1 - siRNA were then investigated using ﬂ ow cytometry . Compared with Lipo 2000 group , siRNA delivered by DCLC nano - Transformers obviously caused the arrest of cell cycle at the G2 / M - phase ( Figure 5B ) and enhanced cellular apoptosis ratio ( 68 . 6 % for nano - Transformers group and 38 . 1 % for Lipo 2000 group , Figure 5C ) . Moreover , as shown in Figure 5D , inhibition of CDK1 expression reduced viability of the HepG2 cells to 25 . 8 % . As for normal liver cell line L02 , silencing of the CDK1 expression did not a ﬀ ect the cell viability ( Figure 5E ) . These results indicated that the CDK1 - siRNA - loaded DCLC nano - Transformers were safe and e ﬀ ective for HCC treatment in vitro . To obtain further insight into the antitumor activity , tumor tissue RT - qPCR and tumor volume measurement were taken to monitor the in vivo gene silencing and therapeutic e ﬃ cacy . Balb / c nude mice bearing HepG2 tumors were peritumorally injected with CDK1 - siRNA - loaded DCLC nano - Transformers , scrambled siRNA - loaded DCLC nano - Transformers , CDK1 - siRNA - loaded Lipo 2000 , or PBS every other day . As shown in Figure 6A , CDK1 mRNA reduction for the DCLC nano - Transformer group reached up to 79 . 6 % ( 48 h after administration ) , which was signi ﬁ cantly higher than that for the Lipo 2000 group ( 10 . 5 % reduction ) . Moreover , DCLC nano - Transformer group signi ﬁ cantly inhibited tumor growth compared to Lipo 2000 and scramble groups ( Figure 6B ) . The percentage of tumor growth inhibition in the DCLC nano - Transformer group was 84 . 84 % compared to PBS control after 21 days of treatment ( Figure 6C , D ) . Hematoxylin and eosin ( H & E ) staining results also showed that DCLC nano - Transformer treatment led to more severe apoptosis in the tumor when compared with other groups ( Figure 6E ) . To evaluate the cytosolic siRNA delivery e ﬃ ciency of DCLC nano - Transformers in vivo , frozen tissue sections and immuno ﬂ uorescent staining were used to analyze the siRNA distribution in tumor tissue . As shown in Figure 6F , siRNA delivered by DCLC nano - Transformers di ﬀ used through the cytoplasm while the spot - like structure ( condensed siRNA molecules ) still existed in the Lipo 2000 group , when comparative siRNA ﬂ uorescent signals were observed in tumor tissues of both groups ( Figure 6G ) . It indicated that DCLC nano - Transformers facilitated siRNA dissociation from nanocarriers during endosomal escape process and could achieve remarkable cytosolic delivery e ﬃ ciency even in the complicated in vivo environment . These results were consistent with in vitro observations ( Figure 3C ) . It is reported that cationic siRNA carriers may induce high levels of in ﬂ ammatory cytokines associated with innate immunogenicity . 44 , 45 When applied to the immune - responsive ICR mice , scrambled siRNA - Figure 5 .

XXXX , XXX , XXX − XXX G or CDK1 - siRNA - loaded DCLC nano - Transformers achieved lower immune response than Lipo 2000 - siRNA nanoparticles with an equal amount of DCLC nano - Transformers per unit of siRNA to Lipo 2000 ( Figure 6H ) . This result indicated the superior biocompatibility of the DCLC nano - Transformers . Collectively , we can draw a conclusion that both the transformable capacity and nonimmunogenicity attributed to the satisfactory therapeutic results of DCLC nano - Trans - formers . Achieving the nonimmunogenic and highly e ﬃ cient siRNA delivery ability , DCLC nano - Transformers were safe and e ﬃ cient for HCC treatment in vivo . In this work , DCLC nano - Transformers composed of synthesized lipid material DC were established to achieve high siRNA delivery e ﬃ ciency with low toxicity . The constructed DCLC nano - Transformers could transform the three - dimensional structure at acidic pH , greatly facilitating the endosomal escape of siRNA through highly e ﬃ cient membrane fusion mechanism . This transformation ability was derived from the speci ﬁ c structural features of DC molecules . Linking the small head of DOA to another bigger headgroup with an endosomal acidic environment - degradable amido bond allowed the molecular conformational transition during degradation . Moreover , DCLC nano - Transformers were anionic in physio - logical pH and nearly neutral in endosomal pH , avoiding the cationic - related toxicity both in vitro and in vivo . The desirable safety along with high gene transfection e ﬃ ciency provided a broad application potential of DCLC nano - Transformers , even in the clinical treatment of cancer . The work presented here could help to provide principles for the development of next - generation , conformational transformable lipid material for e ﬃ cient siRNA delivery . ■ ASSOCIATED CONTENT * S Supporting Information The Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI : 10 . 1021 / acs . nano - lett . 7b05430 .
