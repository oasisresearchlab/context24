Cis - and Trans - acting Functions Required for Endocytosis of the Yeast Pheromone Receptors Nicholas G . Davis , Joseph L . Horecka , and George E Sprague , Jr . Institute of Molecular Biology and Department of Biology , University of Oregon , Eugene , Oregon 97403 Abstract . The Saccharomyces cerevisiae a - factor receptor ( STE3 ) is subject to two modes of endocyto - sis : a constitutive process that occurs in the absence of ligand and a regulated process that is triggered by binding of ligand . Both processes result in delivery of the receptor to the vacuole for degradation . Receptor mutants deleted for part of the COOH - terminal cyto - plasmic domain are disabled for constitutive , but not ligand - dependent internalization . Trans - acfing mutants that impair constitutive endocytosis have been isolated . One of these , renl - 1 , is blocked at a late step in the endocytic pathway , as receptor accumulates in a pre - vacuolar endosome - like compartment . REN1 is identi - cal to VPS2 , a gene required for delivery of newly synthesized vacuolar enzymes to the vacuole . Based on this identity , we suggest a model in which the transport pathways to the vacuole - the endocytic path - way and the vacuolar biogenesis pathway - merge at an intermediate endocytic compartment . As receptor also accumulates at the surface of renl cells , receptor may recycle from the putative endosome to the surface , or REN1 may also be required to carry out an early step in endocytosis . NDOCYTOSIS of cell surface receptors plays a vital role in cell physiology . Endocytosis of some receptors , for example , the transferrin or LDL receptors , is the first step in the delivery of essential nutrients to the cell . En - docytosis of other receptors , particularly hormone recep - tors , serves to control receptor abundance and therefore the cell ' s sensitivity to hormone . Most receptor - mediated en - docytosis is thought to occur via clustering of receptors at clathrin - coated pits , which pinch off from the surface giving coated vesicles . Once internalized , receptor and ligand pass through early and late endosomal compartments . From these compartments the endocytic pathway branches , allowing ei - ther recycling back to the cell surface or delivery to the lyso - some for hydrolysis ( for reviews see Goldstein et al . , 1985 ; Schlessinger , 1988 ; Gruenberg and Howell , 1989 ; Kornfeld and Melman , 1989 ; Griffiths and Gruenberg , 1991 ; Pfeffer , 1992 ) . Many features of endocytosis , including the requirement for initial association with clathrin pits , vary among receptor types . Some receptors , for example the low - density lipopro - tein ( LDL ) ~ receptor , associate spontaneously with the pits and are internalized at a constant rate irrespective of their liganded state ( Anderson et al . , 1978 ) . Other receptors , for example the EGF receptor , associate with clathrin pits only when bound by ligand , and thus it is the ligand binding event 1 .

Receptor types also have different destinies once internalized . LDL and its receptor dissociate in the early endosome . The receptor is then recycled to the surface while the ligand is delivered to the lysosome for hydrolysis ( Basu et al . , 1981 ) . On the other hand , both EGF and its receptor are delivered to and degraded in the lysosome ( Car - penter and Cohen , 1976 ) . Although there is a sophisticated picture of the initial events of endocytosis and the subsequent membrane traffic , the mechanisms that underlie and regulate the processes are poorly understood . In particular , aside from clathrin and clathrin - associated proteins termed adaptins ( Pearse and Robinson , 1984 ) , which are involved in coated pit forma - tion , and rab proteins , a class of GTP - binding proteins some of which have been found associated with early and late en - dosomes ( Chavrier et al . , 1990 ; van der Slijs et al . , 1991 , 1992 ; Bucci et al . , 1992 ) , the molecules that catalyze and control each step of the endocytic pathway are unknown . With the expectation that a genetic analysis would contribute to the identification of such molecules , we have investigated the internalization of the pheromone receptors of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and have begun to isolate mutants defective for internalization . Pheromone receptors enable cell - cell communication as a prelude to mating of the two haploid cell types , a and ot ( Herskowitz , 1989 ) . Each cell type secretes a unique peptide pheromone - a - factor by a cells and a - factor by ct cells - and expresses at its surface a receptor for the pheromone secreted by the other cell type . Binding of pheromone to its cognate receptor activates an in - Â© The Rockefeller University Press , 0021 - 9525 / 93 / 07 / 53 / 13 $ 2 . 00 The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 122 , Number 1 , July 1993 53 - 65 53 tracellular signal transduction pathway that leads to the phys - iological alterations that permit mating . The pheromone receptors are members of a large family of G protein - coupled receptors initially defined by the / ~ - adrenergic receptor and the rhodopsins ( Dohlman et al . , 1991 ) . Although receptors of this family often show little se - quence identity , they do share structural similarities . In par - ticular , they are characterized by an NH2 - terminal domain with seven hydrophobic , presumably membrane - spanning segments followed by a hydrophilic COOH - terminal domain oriented toward the cytoplasm . In cases where it has been examined , deletion of the bulk of the COOH - terminal do - main does not interfere with ligand binding or G protein coupling , indicating that the seven transmembrane segment domain suffices for these functions . Deletion of the receptor COOH - terminal domain results in a heightened and pro - longed response to ligand , implying that this domain func - tions to attenuate receptor activity ( Konopka et al . , 1988 ; Reneke et al . , 1988 ; Dohlman et al . , 1991 ; C . Boone , N . Davis , and G . Sprague , manuscript submitted for publi - cation ) . Endocytosis of the seven transmembrane segment recep tor family has not been extensively studied . Treatment of an - imal cells with ~ - adrenergic agonists results in a rapid loss of surface binding sites , implying that the receptor has been internalized ( Benovic et al . , 1988 ) . Whether these receptors associate with clathrin pits has not been investigated . Studies with yeast have suggested that the a - factor receptor is also likely subject to endocytosis . First , treatment with a - factor results in the loss of surface binding sites ( Jenness and Spatrick , 1986 ) . Second , the a - factor ligand is internalized and degraded by a pathway that involves an intracellular vesicular compartment , perhaps an endosome ( Jenness and Spatrick , 1986 ; Chvatchko et al . , 1986 ; Singer and Riez - man , 1990 ) . Because degradation of t ~ - factor requires vac - uolar protease activity , it is presumed that the ligand is deliv - ered to the vacuole , an organelle equivalent to the lysosome . Third , disruption of the yeast clathrin heavy chain gene ( Payne and Schekman , 1985 ; Lemmon and Jones , 1987 ) reduces the rate of a - factor uptake ( Payne et al . , 1988 ) . Re - cently several mutants that block either the uptake or degra - dation of u - factor have been isolated ( Wichmann et al . , 1992 ; Raths et al . , 1993 ) . However , for neither wild - type ceils nor these endocytosis mutants has the fate of the recep - tor itself been investigated . In this paper we demonstrate endocytosis of the phero - mone receptors by examining the receptor protein directly . We focus on the a - factor receptor and measure its stability and location in the presence and absence of pheromone . We conclude that this receptor is subject to two apparently dis - crete modes of endocytosis , both of which deliver the protein to the vacuole for degradation . One mode is constitutive , oc - curnng in the absence of a - factor ligand , whereas the second mode is triggered by ligand . Receptor mutants deleted for part of the COOH - terminal domain are defective for consti - tutive endocytosis but normal for ligand - stimulated endocy - tosis . We also report the isolation of trans - acting mutations that block receptor endocytosis or subsequent steps in the endocytic pathway ( ren mutations ) . Our characterization suggests that the wild - type REN1 product acts relatively late in the endocytic pathway , as internalized receptor accumu - lates in a prevacuolar endosome - like compartment in renl mutants . Based on the identity of renl with vps2 , a class E vps mutant ( defective in vacuolar protein sorting ) , we sug - gest a model in which the two transport pathways to the vacuole - endocytic transport and the transport of newly syn - thesized vacuolar enzymes - merge at an intermediate en - dosomal compartment before vacuolar delivery . Materials and Methods Plasmids pSL552 ( Bender and Sprngue , 1986 ) has S ' / E3 under the control of the GAL / promoter carded on YCp50 . pSL1922 is the same as pSL552 except for the A365 mutation , a deletion of 310 - bp extending from the STEal SalI site to the PstI site . In - frame fusion required addition ofa 12 - bp SalI linker to the PstI end from which the 3 ' overhang had been removed by treatment with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase . This resulted in the inser - tion of an arginine codon between codon 365 and the two COOH - terminal STE3 codons . pSL2099 has the c - myc 9El0 epitope fused to the COOH terminus of GAL / - STE3 , carded on the LEU2 CEN / ARS vector pRS315 ( Sikorski and Hieter , 1989 ) . 18 new codons , including the c - myc epitope ( Evan et al . , 1985 ) were inserted in - frame at the STE3 Pstl site disrupting only the three final STE3 residues ; the resulting COOH - terrnina125 residues of this fusion protein are now ENTGSKMEQKLISEEDLFLDRGP ( protein sequence from STE3 is underlined ) . Strains SY1793 is a MATc ~ mfa / A mfa2A derivative of Sc252 ( Whiteway et al . , 1990 ) , created by GAL - HO promoted mating type interconversion and two - step gene replacement at the MFA loci ( Table I ; Jensen and Herskowitz , 1984 ; Rothstein , 1991 ) . In addition , the pheromone - dependent FUS1 UAS replaced the HIS3 UAS at the HIS3 locus ( Stevenson et al . , 1992 ) . The dele - tion endpoints of mfalA and mfa2A are the same as for previously reported disruption alleles , mfal : : LEU2 and mfa2 : : UK43 ( Michaelis and Her - skowitz , 1988 ) . SY1817 is a ste3A derivative of SY1793 made by two - step gene replace - ment . This deletion removes the b - TE3 coding sequence and UAS , and ex - tends from an RsaI site 417 bp upstream of the AUG , to a Sacl site 111 bp downstream of the stop codon ( Hagen et al . , 1986 ) . SY1884 is a pep4A derivative of SY1817 ( Rothman et al . , 1986 ) . GAL / - bTE3 ( SY2152 ) or GALI - STE3A365 ( SY2132 ) were constructed by two - step gene replacement at the STE3 locus of SY1884 . SY1369 is a Met + revertant of YYl152 ( Clark et al . , 1988 ) . ste3A ( SY1372 ) , GALI - STE3 ( SY1426 ) and GALI - STE3A365 ( SYI610 ) alleles were inserted into the chromosome of SY1369 by one step replacement of ste3 : : URA3 , selecting for Ura - derivatives with 5 - fluoro - orotic acid ( Boeke et al . , 1984 ) . SY1683 is a pep4A derivative of SY1372 ( Rothman et al . , 1986 ) . SY1553 is a MA / h version of SY1426 made via an HO - induced mating type switch . SY1616 is a pep4 : : UK43 derivative of SY1426 made by one step gene replacement ( Rothman et al . , 1986 ) . SY1498 is amata / derivative of SY1426 carrying XhoI linker insertion mutation 23 ( Tatchell et al . , 1981 ) . ten / 4 was isolated in a matad cell carrying the MATer plasmid pSL602 ( Bender and Sprague , 1986 ) . Loss of pSL602 yielded SY1534 . MATa ( SY1560 ) and MA / h ( SY1614 ) derivatives of SY1534 were created by HO - promoted mating type interconversion . SY1650 is a MATer ren / 4 segregant derived from a backcross of SY1614 to SY1426 . The GAL / - S / F _ 3 constructs in SY1426 and SY1560 were replaced with the natural S / E3 promoter by the two step method yielding SY1574 and SY1579 , respectively . SY1675 is MA ~ GA / d - S ' / F , 3 pep4 : : URA3 segregant from a cross be - tween SY1553 and SY1616 . SY1744 and SY1745 are MATer STE3 pep4 : : URA3 and MATa STE3 segregants of a cross between SY1574 and SY1675 . The GA / _ d - bqE3A365 ( c - myc ) strain SY2559 was constructed by two step gene replacement at the bqE3 locus of SY1683 . The C - terminus of STE3 A365 construct ( described for pSL1922 ) was tagged at its SalI site with the in - frame insertion of 18 new codons including the c - myc 9El0 epitope ( Evan et al . , 1985 ) between Asp 365 and Gly 469 . The resulting C - terminal 25 residues of this fusion protein are now YVDGSKMEQKLISEEDLF - LDRG _ . PP ( protein sequence from STE3 is underlined ) . SY1745 was made GAL / - STE2 via the two step method yielding SY1960 ; The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 122 , 1993 54 for this SFE2 allele , a 326 - bp GALI , IO UAS fragment substitutes for the 360 - bp HindlII fragment that includes the natural STE2 UAS . SY2029 is a MATa GALI - STE2 pep4 : : URA3 segregant of a cross between SY1744 and SY1960 . SY2041 is a MA ~ GALI - STE2 renl - I segregant of a cross between SY1579 and SY1960 . Antisera Rabbit antiserum raised against TrpE - STE3 fusion protein ( Clark et ai . , 1988 ) was affinity - purified using the fusion protein antigen coupled to CNBr - activated Sepharose 4B ( Sigma Immunochemicals , St . Louis , MO ; Roberts et al . , 1991 ) . This fusion has the COOH - terminai 183 residues of STE3 . Another aliquot of this antiserum was affinity - purified using a TrpE - STE3A365 fusion . Rabbit antiserum against the STE2 protein was a generous gift from James Konopka ( Konopka et ai . , 1988 ) . Affinity - purified alkaline phospha - tase ( ALP ) rabbit antiserum was generously provided by Chris Raymond ( University of Oregon ) . Mouse mAb - 1 reactive with the c - myc epitope was purchased from Oncugene Science Inc . ( Manhasset , NY ) . Cell Labeling and Immune Precipitation Exponential cultures of cells ( 2 Ã 107 / mi ) growing at 30Â°C in sup - plemented minimal medium lacking methionine and cysteine were pulse - labeled for 10 rain with 35Smethionine ( 0 . 5 mCi / ml ) and then chased with subsequent addition methionine and cysteine to 50 # g / ml . To prepare protein extracts , 250 # 1 of the labeled cell culture was collected by centrifu - gation , suspended in 150 # 1 digestion buffer ( DB ; 1 . 4 M sorbitol , 25 mM Tris / C1 pH 7 . 5 , 10 mM sodium azide , 10 mM potassium fluoride , 2 mM MgCI ) with 0 . 3 % / 3 - mercaptoethanol and oxaiyticase ( Enzogenetics , Cor - vallis , OR ) at 600 U / ml , and incubated at 30Â°C for 30 rain . Spheroplasts were pelleted , suspended in SDS - PAGE sample buffer ( SB ; 40 mM Tris / C1 pH 6 . 8 , 8 M urea , 0 . 1 mM EDTA , 1 % ~ 3 - mercaptoethanol ) with 2 . 5 % SDS , and then lysed at 100Â°C for 5 rain . Protein extract was diluted 20 - fold into immune precipitation buffer ( IP ; 10 mM Tris / C1 pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 , 2 mM EDTA ) with 0 . 5 mM PMSE 1 # g / ml leupeptin , 1 # g / nil pepstatin and 0 . 5 % IgG - Sorb ( The Enzyme Center , Maiden , MA ) . After 15 rain at 0Â°C , IgGSorb was removed by centrifugation and STE3 antiserum was added to the supernatant at 1 : 200 . After 1 h at 0Â°C , IgGSorb was added to 0 . 5 % . After 30 rain further incubation , immune complexes were washed four times with IP plus 0 . 1 % SDS . Precipitated protein was eluted from the antibody - IgGSorb complex by suspension in SB with 5 % SDS and incuba - tion at 100Â°C for 5 rain . The protein was then subjected to SDS - PAGE . Immunoblots To prepare protein extracts for Western blotting , 1 . 5 x l0 s log - phase cells grown at 30Â°C were pelleted , immediately frozen on dry ice , and then stored at - 70Â°C . Cell pellets were thawed by suspension in 100 / ~ 1 of SB with 5 % SDS and transferred to a 1 . 5 ml microfuge tube containing an 80 # 1 volume of glass beads . After being vortexed for 10 min , samples were incubated at 37Â°C for 10 rain . 25 # 1 of SDS - PAGE sample buffer was added , samples were vortexed for 2 rain , and then 10 # 1 of the supernatant fraction from a 5 - min microfuge spin was subj ~ to electrophoresis . Protein was transferred to nitrocellulose and treated with antibody . For STE3 detection , antiserum that had been affinity purified against the large TrpE - STE3 fu - sion was used at 1 : 10 , 000 . For STE2 , antiserum was used at 1 : 500 dilution . Primary antibodies were detected with an HRP - conjugated anti - rabbit IgG second antibody followed by the ECL chemiluminescent system ( Amer - sham Corp . , Arlington Heights , IL ) . Susceptibility to External Proteases At indicated times , 2 x 106 cells from a culture pulse labeled with 35Smethionine ( as described above ) were incubated for 20 rain at 0Â°C with an equal volume of ice - cold medium containing 20 mM potassium fluoride and 20 mM sodium azide . Cells were collected by centrifugation , suspended in 100 # 1 DB with 0 . 5 % / 3 - mercaptoethanol and incubated at 37Â°C for 30 rain . One half of the sample was treated with protease , with addition of a one - quarter volume of 2 , 500 U / nil Pronase ( in DB ) for 60 rain at 37Â°C . The other half was processed identically in parallel except that no protease was added . Protease was removed via two washes of the pelleted cells with 200 # 1 DB with 1 mM PMSE Cells were then treated as described above for spheroplasting , extract preparation , and immune precipitation of STE3 . When Western analysis was used to assess susceptibility of receptor to external protease , the procedure was modified in several ways . For each timepoint , 3 x l0 s cells were collected and prepared as above except that they were incubated in 0 . 5 ml DB with 0 . 5 % B - mercaptoethanol at 37Â°C for 30 min before protease treatment . Proteolysis was terminated with the addition of TCA to 17 % , samples were frozen on dry ice and then further processed as described ( Ohashi et al . , 1982 ) , except that the TCA - extracted protein was precipitated for 10 rain at 0Â°C , followed by a 10 - rain microfuge spin at 4Â°C . The pellet was washed once with acetone , dessicated , and dis - solved at 70Â°C for 5 rain in 100 # l SDS - PAGE sample buffer , 10 # l of which was then subjected to SDS - PAGE and immunoblotting . As a control , accessibility of a cytoplasmic protein , phosphoglycerate ki - nase ( PGK ) , was assessed with this protocol . No effects of protease treat - ment were observed . However , when Pronase was added subsequent to spheroplasting and treatment with 1 % Triton X - 100 , PGK was found to be completely degraded . Cell cultures were treated with a - factor by addition of an equal volume of cell - free filtrate prepared from a saturated culture of EGI23 cells trans - formed with the a - factor overproduction plasmid pKKI6 ( Kuchler et ai . , 1989 ) . Mock a - factor preparations were obtained from the isogenic mfal : : LEU2 mfa2 : : UR43 strain SM1229 . Quantitation of Mating To qnantitate the mating efficiency of various MAT , strains after shut - off of receptor synthesis , 107 MATa cells ( strain 227 ) were mixed either with 2 x los MATt ~ cells from a log phase YEPGaiactose ( 2 % ) culture or with 2 Ã 106 cells from a YEPGaiactose culture to which 3 % glucose had been added during the final 2 h of growth . The mating mixtures were collected on nitrocellulose filters , and the filters were placed on YEPGaiactose ( 2 % ) plates or on YEPGlucose ( 2 % ) plates . After 6 h at 30Â°C , the number of diploids was titered by suspending the cells and plating them on medium selective for diploids . Mating efficiency is expressed as the number of diploids divided by the total number of MATa cells present on control filters that did not contain the MATa mate . Isolation often Mutants Cultures from 12 colonies of mata / GAL / - STE3 strain SY1498 carrying the MAT , plasmid pSL602 were treated with either 5 . 0 , 1 . 5 , 0 . 5 % or no ethyl methane sulfonate for 1 h as described ( Moir et al . , 1982 ) . Cells were then plated on 2 % gaiactose minimal plates lacking uracil at a density of 3 , 000 viable cells per plate . Colonies were replica - plated to minimal glucose ( 2 % ) plates that had been spread with about 5 x 107 MATa cells ( strain 227 ) in 0 . 3 rod of YEPD . Colonies that gave a strong mating reaction were picked for further study . Cells mutagenized with 1 . 5 % ethyl methane sulfonate yielded mutants at a frequency of " o10 - 3 . On the other hand , no mutants were found in a screen of 20 , 000 unmutagenized cells . From lO s colonies , 70 colonies that exhibited a strong mating reaction were picked . Of these , 45 mated when both growth and mating were done on glucose medium , a protocol that should preclude receptor synthesis . These wore presumed to be defective for glucose repression of the GAL pro - moter and were therefore discarded . To determine whether the remaining mutants carried dominant or recessive mutations , they were crossed to mata / strain SY1498 , and the mating phenotype of the resulting diploids was assessed by the same protocol used in the original mutant screen . 12 diploids showed strong mating and therefore the corresponding , mutants were presumed to carry dominant mutations . The other 13 mutants carried recessive mutations . Indirect Immunofluorescence Preparation of fixed , spheroplasted ceils for indirect immunofluorescence was carried out essentially as described ( Roberts et ai . , 1991 ) , except that oxalyticase at a final concentration of 20 # g / ml was used for spheroplasting . For detection of the receptor with the STE3 antiserum , antibodies that had been affinity - purified against the truncated fusion protein TrpE - STE3 A365 were used . These should react equally well with the STE3A365 recep - tor as they do with the wild - type protein . After incubation with the STE3 antibodies , used at a 1 : 20 dilution , signal was further amplified through three subsequent incubations with secondary antibodies ( purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc . , West Grove , PA ) used at 2 # g / nil : ( a ) goat anti - rabbit IgG ; ( b ) rabbit anti - goat IgG ; and ( c ) fluorescei - nated goat anti - rabbit IgG . Antibody incubations were 1 h at room temper - ature . For the double - staining of myc - tagged receptor and ALP , mouse mAb - I ( Oncogene Science Inc . ) was used at a dilution of 1 : 20 , while the rabbit anti - Davis et al .

To analyze receptor fate directly in both the absence and presence of pheromone , we developed antibodies that recognize the COOH - terminal hydrophilic domain of the a - factor receptor , STE3 ( Clark et al . , 1988 ) . We first examined the stability of STE3 protein in the ab - sence of added a - factor in wild - type cells , as well as in pep4A cells , which are deficient for vacuolar protease activ - ity . STE3 protein was labeled with [ 35S ] methionine in a pulse - chase protocol , immunoprecipitated from cell ex - tracts , and subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis . As shown in Fig . 1 A , STE3 was unstable in wild - type cells , exhibiting a half - life of , x , 20 min . In contrast , the receptor was extremely stable in the pep4A background , showing a half - life much greater than 2 h . Because of the possibility that a culture of a cells could contain low levels of a - factor ( for instance , due to rare mating type switches ) we also ex - amined STE3 protein turnover in MATot PEP4 cells deleted for the a - factor structural genes MFAI and MFA2 . In these cells , the kinetics of STE3 turnover were identical to wild - type cells , indicating that turnover is indeed ligand indepen - dent ( data not shown ) . The rapid rate of receptor degradation and the dependence of this degradation on vacuolar proteases suggests that newly synthesized receptor is delivered to the cell surface , but re - sides there only a short time before being internalized and Figure 10 .

MATc ~ pep4 : : URA3 cells ( SY1616 ) or MATc ~ renl pep4 : : URA3 cells ( SY1653 ) transformed with GALI - STE3 - myc plasmid pSL2099 were grown for 4 h in the presence of 2 % galac - tose , 3 % glucose was added , and growth continued for an addi - tional 30 min . Cells were fixed and prepared for immunofluores - cence as described in Materials and Methods . Fixed cells were treated with two antibody preparations , the anti - myc mAb - 1 and affinity - purified polyclonal antiserum raised against the vacuolar membrane protein , ALP .

As one test of this interpretation , we labeled receptor by a pulse - chase pro - tocol and measured its susceptibility to digestion when whole ceils were treated with exogenous protease ( Trueheart and Fink , 1989 ) . pep4A cells were used to preclude endoge - nous turnover of the receptor . As seen in Fig . 1 B , a small fraction of the STE3 protein , labeled during a 10 - min [ 3sS ] methionine pulse , was susceptible to protease after 1 min of chase . This susceptibility is revealed both by a reduc - tion in the amount of full - length ( 48 kD ) protein and by the appearance of a 30 - kD digestion product . The mass of this product , coupled with its reactivity to the STE3 antiserum , implies that it corresponds to the seventh transmembrane segment and the COOH - terminal cytoplasmic domain . After 10 rain of chase , (cid:127)70 % of the radio - labeled receptor is sus - ceptible to proteolysis by exogenous protease . We interpret these results to mean that only a small fraction of receptor synthesized during the 10 - rain pulse has been delivered to the cell surface by 1 rain into the chase period but that the majority of the newly synthesized receptor is at the cell sur - face 10 min into the chase period . At longer chase times , the radio - labeled receptor is resistant to exogenous protease , suggesting that receptor that had been at the surface has been internalized ( Fig . 1 B , 60 - and 90 - min timepoints ) . This in - ternalization requires energy metabolism , as receptor re - mains susceptible to protease if potassium fluoride and so - dium azide ( 10 mM each ) are added 10 min into the chase period ( data not shown ) . As a second test of the idea that cell surface receptor is subject to constitutive internalization and delivery to the vacuole by an endocytic pathway , we determined the location of receptor by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy . For this analysis , STE3 was tagged at the COOH terminus with the c - myc 9El0 epitope ( Evan et al . , 1985 ) , which is recog - nized by a mouse mAb . The tagged receptor complemented ste3 mutations , and like wild - type STE3 , showed rapid turn - over ( data not shown ) . To facilitate detection of the receptor - derived immunofluorescence signal , the c - myc - tagged STE3 was placed under the control of the inducible GAL / pro - moter . Expression from the GAL / promoter results in a 10 - 20 - fold over - production of the STE3 protein ( data not shown ) , but this over - production caused no change either in the receptor ' s sorting to the surface or its subsequent inter - nalization . In particular , as shown below , STE3 protein ex - pressed from the GAL / promoter showed rapid PEP4 - dependent turnover ( see Fig . 3 ) . Moreover , the kinetics of receptor delivery to the surface and subsequent internaliza - tion as measured by protease susceptibility in GALI - STE3 pep4A cells paralleled the kinetics shown in Fig . 1 B ( data not shown ) . We examined the receptor ' s location both under conditions of continuous synthesis and 2 h subsequent to a glucose - mediated repression of new receptor synthesis ( Fig . 2 ) . The cells arepep4A so that receptor degradation is blocked . Un - der conditions of ongoing receptor synthesis , the receptor was found to locate to two distinct places - the cell surface and an internal compartment . This internal compartment is inferred to be the vacuole because the same compartment is stained by antibodies to the vacuolar membrane protein , ALP . Moreover , receptor staining overlays the vacuole , as defined by depressions seen by Nomarski microscopy ( Fig . Figure 3 . Turnover of the COOH - terminal Truncated Receptor . MATc ~ ste3A cells ( SYI817 ) carrying GAL / - STE3 ( pSL552 ) or GAL / - STE3A365 ( pSL1922 ) were grown to log phase on galac - tose medium . Receptor syn - thesis was shut off with the addition of 3 % glucose . Sam - pies were taken just before glucose addition and at 1 and 2 h after glucose addition . STE3 was visualized by Western analysis of extracts . Molecular weight stan - dards ( in kilodaltons ) are indicated at fight . 2 ) . 2 h subsequent to the shut - off of new receptor synthesis , no surface staining was evident . Rather , essentially all of the receptor - derived fluorescence signal was seen to overlay the vacuole . Loss of surface fluorescence likely reflects the inter - nalization of surface receptor and its delivery to the vacuole . As a further test of the conclusion that the a - factor recep - tor is routed to the vacuole via endocytosis from the cell sur - face , we examined the effect of the secl ' ~ mutation on recep - tor location . At the restrictive temperature , delivery of newly synthesized proteins to the surface is blocked in secl ' ~ ceils ; surface - targeted proteins instead accumulate in secretory vesicles ( Novick and Schekman , 1979 ) . In con - trast , delivery of proteins whose primary destination is the vacuole proceeds normally in secl cells ( Stevens et al . , 1982 ; Roberts et al . , 1989 ) . After temperature shift of MATot pep4A secl ~ cells , expression of a GAL / - driven c - myc - tagged STE3 protein was induced with galactose and receptor visualized by immunofluorescence . No vacuolar staining was seen ( data not shown ) . Instead dispersed punctate cyto - plasmic staining was found often concentrated near the growing end of the cell ( data not shown ) . Thus , delivery of receptor to the vacuole requires prior delivery to the cell surface . Receptor COOH - terminal Truncation Mutants Are Disabled for Constitutive Endocytosis Mammalian cell surface receptors that undergo constitutive , Figure 4 . Susceptibility of the COOH - terminal truncated receptor to exogenous pro - tease . MATot pep4 : : URA3 cells that were GALI - STE3 ( SY1616 ) or GALI - STE3A365 ( SY1684 ) were grown for 2 . 5 h in the presence of 2 % galactose , 3 % glucose was added , and growth continued for 2 . 5 h . Whole cells were digested with 1 mg / ml Pro - nase ( + ) , or mock digested with no protease ( - ) for 1 h at 37Â°C . Subsequently , extracts were prepared and subjected to Western analysis using STE3 antiserum . Molecular weight standards ( in kilodal - tons ) are indicated at right . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 122 , 1993 58 ligand - independent endocytosis have been found to have se - quences in their cytoplasmic domains that direct sequestra - tion into clathrin coated pits and subsequent internalization ( Trowbridge , 1991 ) . Receptor mutants deleted for these " en - docytosis signals " do not get internalized . To examine the role of STE3 protein ' s 187 - residue COOH - terminal cytoplas - mic domain in receptor endocytosis , we constructed STE3 mutants partially truncated for this domain . These mutants retain the ability to function in signal transduction as they fully complemented ste3A alleles . The receptor structural genes were placed under control of the inducible GAL / pro - moter and the ability of the mutant receptors to be internal - ized was evaluated by the same assays used above for wild - type receptor : PEP4 - dependent turnover , accessibility to surface protease , and indirect immunofluorescence . To follow turnover , cells with either wild - type or mutant receptor GAL / constructs were grown on galactose , to allow expression , and then glucose was added to block further syn - thesis . At intervals , samples were withdrawn and STE3 abundance was assessed by Western analysis of cell extracts . As with the radioactive pulse - chase experiment , wild - type STE3 was rapidly turned over ( Fig . 3 ) . STE3A433 , missing the COOH - terminal 37 residues , showed a stability similar to wild - type receptor ( data not shown ) . In contrast . STE3A399 and STE3A365 , missing 71 and 105 residues , were very stable and showed no degradation two hours after the block to new synthesis ( Fig . 3 and data not shown ) . The degradation of STE3 protein therefore requires a segment of the COOH - terminal domain . Accessibility of receptor to exogenous protease was as - sessed in pep4A cells having either the GALI - STE3 or the GALl - STE3A365 construct . Cells were grown in galactose for 2 . 5 h , glucose was added to halt further synthesis , and protease treatment was initiated after a 2 . 5 - h incubation in the glucose medium . As seen previously with radiolabeled STE3 ( Fig . 1 B ) , wild - type receptor accumulated in a pro - tease - resistant compartment ( Fig . 4 ) , presumably the vacu - ole . The protease susceptibility of STE3A365 protein was markedly different from wild - type STE3 . Even 2 . 5 h after imposition of the glucose block to synthesis all truncated receptor was sensitive to external protease , as revealed by the disappearance of the 33 - kD STE3A365 band and the ap - pearance of the 18 - kD digestion product . Finally , by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy , the STE3A365 protein accumulated at the cell surface ( Fig . 5 ) , whereas wild - type receptor accumulated in the vacuole , as before ( Fig . 2 ) . The surface accumulation of STE3A365 does not result from its overproduction from the GAL / pro - moter . When expressed from its natural promoter , STE3 - A365 was stable and exclusively located at the cell surface ( data not shown ) . We conclude that the STE3A365 receptor is not subject to constitutive endocytosis . Ligand - dependent Receptor Internalization The experiments described thus far establish that the a - factor receptor is internalized continuously in the absence of ligand . Does the receptor also exhibit ligand - induced en - docytosis ? To answer this question we took advantage of STE3A365 , which is disabled for constitutive endocytosis . Synthesis of receptor was induced by growth of GAL / - STE3A365pep4A cells in galactose for 90 min and receptor was allowed to accumulate at the cell surface during a 60 - min glucose chase . The location of the receptor was evalu - ated by the extracellular protease assay at various times after addition of a - factor . In the absence of added a - factor , STE3A365 was susceptible to digestion by external protease ( Fig . 6 ) . In this experiment the cytoplasmic domain diges - tion product was run off the gel , so protease susceptibility is manifest only by the disappearance of the receptor protein . 10 min after a - factor addition , a substantial portion of the receptor was resistant to protease , and after 90 min , the receptor protein was completely resistant to protease . We conclude that pheromone caused the receptor to be removed from the surface and delivered to an internal cellular com - partment . Thus , although STE3A365 is totally disabled for constitutive endocytosis , it remains capable of a phero - mone - dependent internalization . Figure 5 . Indirect immunofluorescence of the COOH - terminal truncated receptor . MATer pep4A cells harboring either ste3A ( SY1884 ) , GALI - STE3 ( SY2152 ) , or GALI - STE3A365 ( SY2132 ) at the chromosomal STE3 locus were grown for 5 h in the presence of 2 % galactose , 3 % glucose was added , and growth was continued for an additional hour . Cells were fixed and prepared for im - rnunofluorescence as described in Materials and Methods . The top panel shows a representative cell of each strain visualized by Nomarski microscopy . Cell surface depressions correspond to vacuoles . The panels below show the same cells under fluorescent conditions , stained with STE3 antiserum . Figure 6 .

MATt ~ GA / d - STF _ 3 A365 pep4A cells ( SY2132 ) were grown for 1 . 5 h in the presence of 2 % galactose , chased for 1 h with 3 % glu - cose , and then treated with pheromone or mock pheromone . At the times indicated , samples were removed and 10 mM sodium azide was added . Whole cells were then subjected to surface proteolysis with 1 mg / ml Pronase ( + ) for 1 h at 37Â°C or mock digested ( - ) with no protease . STE3A365 protein was visualized by Western analysis . Davis et al . Receptor Endocytosis in Yeast 59 Correlated with the change in subcellular location , phero - mone also caused extensive covalent modification of the receptor protein , as seen in Fig . 6 . Although we have not in - vestigated the nature of this modification , it is known that other members of this receptor family , including the a - factor receptor , show increased phosphorylation on the COOH - terminal domain in response to hormone ( Reneke et al . , 1986 ; Dohlman et al . , 1991 ) . a - factor - dependent internalization was also followed by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy . For this experi - ment , the STE3A365 receptor was tagged at its COOH ter - minus with the c - myc 9El0 epitope ( Evan et al . , 1985 ) and placed under the control of the GAH promoter . These cells were cultured via the galactose - glucose protocol and then treated with a - factor or mock pheromone for 1 . 5 h . The mock - treated cells primarily showed surface staining ( Fig . 7 ) . In contrast , after a - factor treatment no surface staining was evident . Instead all of the receptor - derived fluorescence signal was seen to be vacuolar , showing complete coinci - dence with the ALP - derived fluorescence and with the vacuolar depressions seen by Nomarski microscopy ( Fig . 7 ) . Constitutive and Ligand - dependent Endocytosis Are both G Protein - independent Processes The endocytic uptake of or - factor pheromone and the cor - related loss of surface binding sites was found to proceed upon pheromone challenge in MATa cells lacking the hetero - trimeric G protein ( Jenness and Spatrick , 1986 ; Zanolari et al . , 1992 ) . To determine whether the constitutive or ligand - mediated endocytosis of the a - factor receptor requires the G protein , we expressed GALI - STE3 or GALI - STE3A365 re - ceptor constructs in diploid cells , which do not transcribe the G protein structural genes ( Miyajima et al . , 1987 ; Diet - zel and Kurjan , 1987 ; Whiteway et al . , 1989 ) . Both constitu - tive and ligand - dependent endocytosis proceeded with nor - mal kinetics ( data not shown ) . This implies that the endocytic machinery recognizes the receptor proper , not a G protein / receptor complex . Genetic Screen for Transacting Mutants that Block Endocytic Turnover of STE3 Protein The different locations of wild - type STE3 and STE3A365 proteins following the galactose to glucose pulse - chase pro - tocol might result in different mating capacities for strains carrying these constructs . We therefore compared the ability of GALI - STE3 and GALI - STE3A365 strains to mate under several conditions . When growth and mating were carried out on galactose medium , which allows continuous receptor synthesis , the strains mated equally well ( Table II ) . However , when cells were grown on galactose but transferred to glu - cose medium 2 h before mating , GALl - YlE3A365 cells mated efficiently , but GAL / - STE3 ceils mated poorly ( Table 1I ) . The ability of the STE3A365 cells to mate appears to reflect the retention of receptor at the surface rather than simply the failure to degrade the receptor , as GAL / - STE3 pep4A ceils mated poorly even though the receptor is stable ( Table I ) . We took advantage of the mating difference of GALI - STE3 and GALI - STE3A365 to isolate mutants disabled for recep - tor internalization . Mutagenized GAL / - STT , 3 cells were screened for mutants that showed strong mating following glucose - mediated repression of new receptor synthesis , and 25 mutant colonies were identified ( see Materials and Methods ) . To determine whether the mutations were domi - nant or recessive , the mutants were mated to a mata / strain and the mating properties of the resulting odal - diploid assessed in the galactose / glucose protocol ( note : odal - diploids mate as ot ceils ; Kassir and Simchen , 1976 ) . By this criterion 12 of the 25 mutants carded dominant mutations . Of these , four are likely chain termination mutations in STE3 because immunoblotting revealed that they expressed trun - cated forms of STE3 protein . The other eight dominant mu - tations may be STE3 alleles that lead to more subtle altera - tions in STE3 or they may be mutant alleles of other genes . Analysis of renl - 1 Mutants The recessive mutations should identify trans - acting func - tions required for endocytosis . We chose a particularly strong example of this class for further study . This mutation segregated as a single gene uniinked to STE3 . As the mutant is defective in receptor endocytosis ( see below ) , the gene has been named REN1 . We quantitated the mating of renl - 1 cells in the galactose - glucose mating protocol used to isolate the mutant . As shown in Table II , renl - 1 cells mated as well as GALI - STE3A365 cells . Northern blot analysis showed that renM does not affect the synthesis or stability of STE3 mRNA . Moreover , glucose repression of GALI - STE3 mRNA synthesis occurred with identical kinetics in wild - type and renl - 1 cells ( data not shown ) . We therefore consid - ered it likely that renM affected receptor endocytosis and tested the possibility directly . Table 11 .

STE3 was visualized by Western analysis . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 122 , 1993 60 Figure 9 . Susceptibility of the receptor in renl cells to exog - enous protease . The location of the receptor in three pep4 : : URA3 strains was as - sessed using surface prote - olysis . MATt ~ GALI - STE3 ( SY1616 ) , MATc ~ GALI - STE3 renl - 1 ( SY1653 ) , and MATc ~ GALI - STE3A365 ( SY1684 ) cells were grown and treated as described in the legend to Fig . 3 . An immunoblot of the resulting cell extracts is shown , using STE3 antiserum as probe . Note that the elec - trophoretic mobility of STE3 protein from RENI + cells is slowed relative to its mobility when extracted from renl - 1 cells . This mobility shift is most readily observed in pep4 cells and we therefore believe that it reflects a modification that occurs in the vacuole where the receptor accumulates . Molecular weight stan - dards ( in kilodaltons ) are indicated at right . renl - 1 Slows STE3 Turnover We examined the turnover of wild - type STE3 protein in both REN1 Ã· and renl - 1 cells using the galactose - glucose pulse - chase protocol . In wild - type cells , receptor turnover was rapid . In renl - 1 cells , however , turnover was slowed con - siderably ( Fig . 8 A ) . In separate pulse - chase experiments with [ 3 ~ S ] methionine , STE3 expressed from its own pro - rooter exhibited a half - life of ' ~ 90 rain in the renl - 1 back - ground ( data not shown ) , compared to 20 min in REN / + cells ( Fig . 1 ) . Mutations that slow STE3 protein turnover should lead to steady state over - accumulation of the recep - tor . In keeping with this expectation , STE3 protein ex - pressed from its natural promoter was found to be more abundant in renl - 1 cells than in wild - type cells ( Fig . 8 B ) . The experiments described above established that consti - tutive turnover of wild - type STE3 is slowed in renl - 1 mu - tants . Ligand - mediated turnover of STE3A365 was also slowed in renl - 1 cells ( data not shown ) . STE3 Protein of renl - 1 Cells Is Susceptible To ExtraceUular Protease The mating and receptor turnover phenotypes of the renl - 1 mutant are very similar to those of cells expressing STE3A365 protein . We were therefore interested to compare the location of STE3 protein in renl - 1 cells to its location in wild - type cells . We first used the extraceUular protease assay and the GAL / constructs to evaluate receptor location after a galactose to glucose pulse - chase protocol . As expected , protease caused essentially no diminution of the full - length wild - type STE3 protein expressed in wild - type cells , and only a small amount of released cytoplasmic tail digestion product was observed ( Fig . 9 ) . Under the same conditions , all of the STE3A365 protein was susceptible to the protease and was converted to its corresponding cytoplasmic domain digestion product . The result for ten1 - 1 cells is intermediate between these two extremes . In the renl - 1 background , STE3 protein was partially susceptible to the external protease , and a substantial amount of the cytoplasmic tail digestion prod - uct was seen ( Fig . 9 ) . However , in contrast to the results seen for STE3A365 , a substantial fraction of total STE3 protein was resistant to protease . Internalized STE3 Is Extra - vacuolar in renl - 1 Cells The experiments described above imply that constitutive en - docytosis may be impaired , but not completely blocked , in the renl - 1 background ; some receptor clearly is internalized by the mutant cells . To determine the location of this inter - nalized receptor we stained mutant and wild - type ceils with antibodies that recognize the myc - tagged STE3 protein and antibodies that recognize the vacuolar membrane protein , ALP . 30 min after glucose - mediated shut off of the myc - tagged GAL1 - STE3 renl - 1 , but not REN1 Ã· cells , retained a significant amount of receptor at the cell surface ( Fig . 10 ) . Both genotypes also exhibited internal staining for receptor , but the pattern of staining was markedly different . In the REN1 + background , internalized receptor was vacuolar . Receptor staining showed complete colocalization with the immunofluorescent signal from the vacuolar marker protein ALP . Furthermore both signals coincided with vacuolar depressions seen by Nomarski microscopy . Most renl - 1 cells , on the other hand , showed little or no overlap of the two signals . Instead , bodies staining brightly for the receptor were often seen adjacent to the vacuole . Such bodies may represent an intermediate endocytic compartment through which the receptor normally passes on its way from surface to vacuole . Similar extra - vacuolar bodies have recently been de - scribed for a subset of mutants defective in vacuolar protein sorting , Class E vps mutants ( Raymond et al . , 1992 ) . vps mutants were selected for their aberrant secretion to the cul - ture medium of the soluble vacuolar protease , carboxypepti - dase Y ( CPY ) ( Bankaitis et al . , 1986 ; Rothman and Stevens , 1986 ) . The Class E mutant subset secretes ~ , 40 % of newly synthesized CPY . In addition , CPY that remains intracellu - lar occupies a novel compartment . By immunofluorescence microscopy , it is found to stain bodies located just adjacent to the vacuole . These structures also contain several other vacuolar membrane proteins whose vacuolar delivery is also presumably blocked ( Raymond et al . , 1992 ) . Because of this morphological similarity of renl cells with Class E vps mutants , we asked if renl showed a vps sorting defect for CPY . Indeed , like the Class E vps mutants , renl - 1 cells were shown to secrete some CPY ( data not shown ) . Figure 1L Turnover of the a - factor receptor . Wild - type MAYb ( SY1960 ) , ren / - 1 ( SY2041 ) , and pep4 : : URA3 ( SY2029 ) cells that carry GAL / - STE2 at the STE2 locus were grown for 3 h in the pres - ence of 2 % galactose , 3 % glu - cose was added , and growth continued for several hours . Protein extracts were prepared from samples taken just before glucose addi - tion , and at 1 and 2 h after glucose addition . STE2 was visualized by Western analysis using antisera generously provided by James Konopka . Davis et aL Receptor Endocytosis in Yeast 61 Given that renl - I cells exhibit a weak vps - phenotype , we considered the possibility that renl - 1 may be an allele of a known VPS gene . Complementation analysis of renl - 1 with the complete set of vps mutants indicated an identity with vps2 , a member of the Class E subset ( Raymond et al . , 1992 ) . Turnover of the t ~ - factor Receptor Is REN1 - and PEP4 - dependent To extend the analysis of receptor turnover , we examined the metabolism of the other pheromone receptor , the u - factor receptor ( STE2 ) , in a variety of genetic backgrounds using a GAL / - STE2 construct . Like STE3 protein , STE2 protein was degraded rapidly in wild - type cells during the glucose chase . The renl - 1 mutation slowed this turnover , and pep4A blocked turnover altogether ( Fig . 11 ) . Discussion Pheromone Receptors Are Subject to Two Modes of Endocytosis Two distinct modes of endocytosis appear to operate on the yeast a - factor receptor : a constitutive , ligand - independent mechanism and a regulated , ligand - dependent mechanism . In both types of endocytosis the receptor traverses the same subcellular territory , moving from the cell surface to the vacuole where it is degraded . Three experimental observations established that the a - factor receptor is subject to endocytosis in the absence of ligand . First , pulse - chase experiments demonstrate that the receptor is an unstable protein whose degradation depends on vacuolar proteases . Second , using exogenous protease to measure the amount of receptor present at the cell surface , we found that newly synthesized a - factor receptor remains protease sensitive only for a short interval after its delivery to the surface , implying a rapid constitutive internalization . Finally , indirect immunofluorescence assays show that over the same time course the receptor accumulates in the vacu - ole . Together our results provide the following picture of the dynamics of receptor trafficking . Newly synthesized recep - tor is delivered via the secretory pathway to the cell surface where it resides only transiently , exhibiting a half - life of 20 min . Receptor is then internalized and delivered to the vacuole where it is degraded . A second mode of endocytosis was recognized because of the properties of a - factor receptor mutants lacking half of the COOH - terminal cytoplasmic domain . These mutants fail to undergo constitutive endocytosis , suggesting that the STE3 A365 and STE3A399 mutations delete " signals " on the recep - tor necessary to this process . For example , perhaps these signals are required for capture into clathrin - coated pits ( see below ) . Despite the block to constitutive endocytosis , these mutant receptors are still subject to ligand - mediated endocy - tosis . Because the mutant receptors are defective for one mode of endocytosis but not the other , we suggest that there is at least one mechanistic step that distinguishes the two classes of endo ~ ' ytosis . Another possibility is that the en - docytosis machinery recognizes a holistic feature of the COOH - terminal cytoplasmic domain , perhaps the extent of a posttranslational modification . In this view , the COOH - terminal receptor mutants after pheromone treatment would show the same extent of modification as wild - type receptor exhibits in the absence of pheromone . The a - factor receptor also exhibits both modes of endocy - tosis . By assays identical to those used to analyze the a - fac - tor receptor , we showed that the a - factor receptor is subject to rapid constitutive endocytosis . Previous studies implied that the a - factor receptor was also subject to ligand - mediated endocytosis . In particular , it was found that when cells were treated with pheromone , cell surface binding sites were lost rapidly ( half - life ~ o20 min ) ( Jermess and Spatrick , 1986 ; Konopka et ai . , 1988 ; Reneke et al . , 1988 ) , presum - ably reflecting endocytosis of the receptor . Although not the focus of these studies , the experiments also provided hints that the a - factor receptor undergoes constitutive endocyto - sis . In particular , a slow loss of a - factor binding sites was observed in the absence of ligand ( surface half - life > 2 h at 25Â°C ; about 45 min at 34Â°C ) . This rate differs considerably from the rapid turnover we observe for both pheromone receptors and likely reflects the different protocol used ( their experiments were carried out in the presence of cyclohexi - mide at 25 or 340C ) . Nonetheless , it seems likely that the two experimental protocols reveal the same process , as t ~ - factor receptors deleted for part of the COOH - terminal cy - toplasmic domain were blocked for this slow constitutive loss of binding sites , but remained competent for the ligand - mediated loss ( Konopka et ai . , 1988 ) . If this interpretation is correct , these data again imply that constitutive and ligand - mediated endocytosis may have a different mechanis - tic basis . The rapid constitutive endocytosis of the pheromone receptors is not likely due to bulk endocytosis of the plasma membrane . Rather , two observations imply that the capacity for constitutive endocytosis is specifically built in to these proteins . First , the COOH - terminally truncated receptors , STE3A365 and STE3A399 fail to undergo constitutive en - docytosis presumably because they lack requisite signals . Second , the plasma membrane ATPase is turned over very slowly , showing a half - life of > 10 h ( Benito et al . , 1991 ) . Possible Roles for Constitutive Endocytosis Constitutive endocytosis of the pheromone receptors seems at first glance to be an unproductive and unnecessary pro - cess . What purpose might it serve ? Two possibilities are es - pecially appealing . First , receptor endocytosis may facilitate the switch in receptor type that must occur when yeast cells undergo mating - type interconversion . Most wild strains of yeast are homothailic and under certain conditions can change mating types as frequently as every cell division cy - cle . The change is effected by a switch in the genetic informa - tion present at the mating - type locus , which then directs the synthesis of the receptor and pheromone species appropriate for the new mating type . This rapid phenotypic conversion of mating type likely requires removal of old receptor be - cause cells that express both receptors axe defective for mat - ing ( Bender and Sprague , 1989 ) . Constitutive endocytosis provides a rapid means to achieve removal of old receptor . A second role for constitutive endocytosis may be in part - ner selection during the mating process , a and t ~ cells sense the location of nearby potential mating partners , apparently by detecting a gradient of pheromone concentration ( Jackson and Hartwell , 1990a , b ) . In response , they reorient cell The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 122 , 1993 62 polarity and focus growth toward the partner . Newly synthe - sized receptor is therefore deposited at the region of the cell surface nearest the partner . The simultaneous removal of receptor from other surface sites by constitutive endocytosis would reinforce the emerging asymmetric receptor distribu - tion . Thus , constitutive endocytosis may be an important component of partner selection during the courtship phase of mating . In keeping with this possibility , strains expressing COOH - terminal truncated receptors are impaired for part - ner selection ( Jackson and Hartwell , 1990a ; C . Boone , N . Davis , and G . Sprague , unpublished results ) . In principle , constitutive endocytosis could also serve as a means to set the cell ' s level of sensitivity to pheromone . COOH - terminal truncated receptors are defective for consti - tutive endocytosis and also confer increased sensitivity to pheromone ( Konopka et al . , 1988 ; Reneke et al . , 1988 ; C . Boone , N . Davis and G . Sprague , unpublished results ) . However , we infer that the correspondence of these two receptor properties is fortuitous because renl mutants , which are impaired for constitutive endocytosis of wild - type receptor , do not show increased sensitivity to pheromone ( N . Davis and G . Sprague , unpublished results ) . Thus , it seems unlikely that constitutive endocytosis plays a major role in determining sensitivity to pheromone . Functions Required for Endocytosis To begin to identify gene products required for endocytosis we developed a screen to isolate mutants defective for the process . The screen uses a simple mating assay to reveal mu - tants that retain functional receptor at the surface after a shut off of new receptor synthesis . In principle , mutants may be blocked either at the initial stages of endocytosis or at any stage from which endocytic vesicles can recycle to the sur - face . In this context , it should be noted that receptors located in the vacuole cannot be recycled to the surface . This conclu - sion follows from the observation that pep4 mutants , which accumulate rec , eptor in the vacuole , cannot mate in the assay ( Table II ) . Thus , the mutant isolation scheme will not reveal functions that are simply required for vacuolar proteolytic activity . The scheme requires that the mutants be defective for constitutive endocytosis , but they may also be defective for ligand - mediated endocytosis if the two processes share common steps . Analysis of one mutant strain revealed that constitutive en - docytosis is indeed altered . In this renl strain , receptor ac - cumulates in two locations - at the cell surface and in an in - tracellular compartment that lies near the vacuole . We suggest that this compartment represents a yeast endosome . The ten / defect apparently blocks traffic from the putative endosome to the vacuole . In animal cells , the endosome serves a crossroads where the fate of internalized material is decided - whether to continue on to the lysosome for degradation or to exit the pathway , as many receptors do , and recycle back to the cell surface . If recycling occurs in yeast , then the accumulation of receptor at the surface of ten ~ mu - tant cells could be a secondary result ofa ren / - imposed block to vacuolar delivery . Receptor that accumulates in the endo - some may be free to recycle back to the surface via an exist - ing recycling pathway . Alternatively , the accumulation of receptor at the surface may indicate that REM has a direct role in receptor internalization . Although our analysis of the ren / - 1 mutant has focused on constitutive endocytosis , the observation that ligand mediated turnover of receptor ( STE3A365 ) is slowed in renl - 1 cells indicates that REN1 is also required for ligand mediated endocytosis . The finding that REAr / is identical to VPS2 implies that this gene is required for proper function of two modes of trans - port to the vacuole - transport of proteins internalized by en - docytosis and the transport of newly synthesized vacuolar enzymes . One possibility is that these two pathways converge at a point before delivery to the vacuole and that REN1 / VPS2 is required to carry out a step after the convergence . Indeed , in animal cells , a similar convergence of lysosome biogenic and endocytic pathways has been established ( Griffiths et al . , 1988 ) . In keeping with this possibility , Class E vps mutants , including vps2 , accumulate a novel organelle that contains a number of newly synthesized proteins normally destined for vacuolar delivery : CPY , the vacuolar ATPase , and di - amino - dipeptidyl peptidase B ( Raymond et al . , 1992 ) . ( We note , however , that not all vacuolar proteins - in particular ALP - are impaired for delivery to the vacuole ; for discus - sion see Raymond et al . , 1992 . ) These organelles are likely identical to those containing internalized a - factor receptor that we observe in the ren / mutants . Proof of this will await double - stained immunofluorescence showing colocalization of endocytosed receptor and vacuolar proteins within these presumptive endosomes . Although not identified by our small collection of Ren - mutants , clathrin appears to be a second function required for constitutive endocytosis . As noted in the introduction , disruption of the clathrin heavy chain gene leads to a reduc - tion in the rate of a - factor uptake ( Payne et al . , 1988 ) . Moreover , we find that a temperature - sensitive mutation in this gene leads to a reduction both in the rate of or - factor up - take and in the constitutive internalization of the a - factor receptor upon shift to nonpermissive temperature ( E Tan , N . Davis , G . Sprague , and G . Payne , unpublished results ) . The rapid onset of these phenotypes after temperature shift implies a direct role for clathrin in the endocytosis of the yeast pheromone receptors . Recently , three newly identified genes have been suggested to have a role in the endocytosis of the yeast pheromone receptors ( Wichmann et al . , 1992 ; Raths et al . , 1993 ) . Mu - tation of these genes results in a defect in the uptake and / or degradation of the or - factor pheromone , end3 and end4 mu - tant cells display surface binding sites for a - factor phero - mone but are defective for pheromone uptake , implying that they are defective for the initial step of receptor internaliza - tion from the surface ( Raths et al . , 1993 ) . On the other hand , the yeast YPT7gene , isolated by virtue of homology to Rab7 , which encodes a late endosome - associated GTP - binding protein in animal cells , may control a later step in the endo - cytic pathway . Disruption of YPT7 blocks a - factor degrada - tion , but not the initial uptake of pheromone by the mutant cells ( Wichmann et al . , 1992 ) . However , the defect in a - fac - tor degradation associated with ypt7 mutants may not be due to impaired endocytic transport . Instead , it may reflect im - paired vacuolar function . Indeed , ypt7 mutant cells show a generalized defect in the processing of vacuolar zymogens as well as a grossly disrupted vacuolar morphology ( Wichmann et al . , 1992 ) . Our analysis of the endocytosis of the yeast pheromone receptors has begun to define discrete steps in a pathway for receptor transport connecting the cell surface to the vacuole . Davis et al . Receptor Endocytosis in Yeast 63 The finding that the endocytic and vacuolar biogenic path - ways likely converge in yeast , just as they do in animal cells , coupled with the involvement of clathrin and the possible in - volvement of Rab proteins in both the yeast and animal cell processes ( Chavrier et al . , 1990 ; van der Slijs et al . , 1991 , 1992 ; Bucci et al . , 1992 ; Wichmann et al . , 1992 ) , implies that many functions required for endocytosis in yeast will have animal cell counterparts .
