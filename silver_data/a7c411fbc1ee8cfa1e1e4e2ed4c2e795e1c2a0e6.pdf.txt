Ganze Netzwerke aus dynamischen Protein - Protein Wechselwirkungen steuern das Leben auf zellulärer Ebene . Thema dieser Arbeit ist es mittels Computersimulationen ein besseres Verständnis von Proteinkomplexen und molekularen Rotoren zu erlangen . Hierbei konzentriere ich mich auf drei Schwerpunkt - themen : Erstens trage ich dazu bei ein besseres Verständnis zur methodischen Unter - suchung der Energielandschaften von Proteinen und Proteinkomplexen mittels der Anwendung vektorieller Kräfte zu erlangen . Zweitens wende ich diese Methode an um den biologisch wichtigen Integrin - Talin Komplex zu studieren , welcher die in - itiale , kraftleitende Verbindung zwischen Zellinnerem und - äußerem schaﬀt . Drittens studiere ich wie mittels elektrischer Terahertz - Felder ein molekular Rotor auf einer Goldoberﬂäche gesteuert wird . Kräfte sind von Natur aus vektorielle Größen . Zur eindeutigen Beschreibung sind Betrag , Richtung und Angriﬀspunkt nötig . Am Beispiel zweier Protein Komplexe wer - den Wichtigkeit und Einﬂuß verschiedener Kraftparameter für die Entwicklung des Systems unter Krafteinﬂuss untersucht . Das erste System ist ein Antikörper - Peptid Komplex . Antikörper sind essentielle Bestandteile des adaptiven Immunsystems und ihre Hauptaufgabe besteht in der Bindung pathogener Antigene . Anhand einer solchen Antikörper - Antigen Bindung wird gezeigt , dass die Variation der Kraftangriﬀspunkte zu unterschiedlichen Entbindungspfaden mit jeweils zwei Hauptbarrieren führt . Ex - perimentelle Ergebnisse mittels Atomarer Kraftmikroskopie ( AFM ) stimmen hierbei sehr gut mit Molekularen Dynamik ( MD ) Simulationen des Systems überein . Ferner konnte ich für alle Entbindungsbarrieren die genauen molekularen Wechselwirkungen mittels MD Simulationen identiﬁzieren . Ein weiteres interessantes System ist der Barnase - Barstar Komplex . Die evolutio - näre Optimierung des Ribonuklease - Inhibitor Komplexes hat eine sehr starke Bindung geschaﬀen . Anhand dieses Komplexes werden weitere Protokolle für die Erkundung der Energielandschaft von Protein Komplexen getestet . Besonders hervorzuheben ist , das mittels variierender Parameter eine interne Hierarchie der Stabilität der Bindungs - 1 Zusammenfassung und Faltungsmotive erstellt werden kann . Zusätzlich wird gezeigt , dass mit hohen Zug - geschwindigkeiten die Labilität und somit die Barrieren des Komplexes dominieren , während bei niedrigen Zuggeschwindigkeiten die Stabilität und die Minima in der Energielandschaft das Verhalten des Komplexes bestimmen . Kräfte sind nicht nur Mittel zum Zweck , sondern beeinﬂussen das Leben auf allen Längenskalen , von ganzen Organismen bis zu nanoskopischen Proteinen . Für Inte - grine als die wichtigsten Adhäsionsrezeptoren der Zellen spielen Kräfte physiologisch eine besonders wichtige Rolle . Das Integrin wird von seinem Ligand Talin aktiviert . Der Integrin - Talin Komplex stellt die initiale kraftleitende Verbindung zwischen ex - trazellulärer Matrix und intracellulärem Zytoskelett her . Die zwei wichtigsten Ergeb - nisse sind die Erweiterung des Aktivierungsmechanismusses des Komplexes um eine zusätzlich benötigte Kraftkomponente und die Entdeckung der kraftinduzierten Sta - bilisierung des Komplexes durch die Ausbildung eines stabilisierenden beta - Faltblatts zwischen Integrin und Talin . Des Weiteren konnte ich zeigen , dass der Komplex ver - sucht sich entlang seiner mechanisch stabileren Achse auszurichten , falls er frei rotieren kann . In der Natur sind molekulare Rotoren wichtige Bausteine für einige essentielle Nan - omaschinen . Besonders bekannte Beispiele hierfür sind die F1 - ATPase oder das Fla - gellum von Bakterien . In beiden Fällen entscheidet die Rotationsrichtung sogar über die Wirkung der Maschinen . Für die kontrollierte Verwendung von Rotoren in artiﬁ - ziellen Nanomaschinen wird ein besseres Verständnis dieser Systeme von nöten sein . In meinem letzten Projekt untersuche ich einen diethylsulﬁd Rotor auf einer Gold ( 111 ) Oberﬂäche mittels MD Simulationen . Die Energielandschaft dieses Rotors kann mit elektrischen Feldern im Terahertzbereich so manipuliert werden , dass die eﬀekti - ve Rotationsrichtung und - frequenz im Gigahertzbereich gesteuert werden kann . Eine theoretische Beschreibung dieses Phänomens und seine Abhängigkeit von der Struktur des Rotors werden behandelt . Dies kann ein erster Schritt zu einem Interface zwischen bekannten elektrischen Schaltungen und zukünftigen artiﬁziellen Nanomaschinen sein . 2 Abstract The scope of this work is to gain insight and a deeper understanding of exploring and controlling molecular devices like proteins and rotors by ﬁne tuned manipulation via mechanical or electrical energies . I focus on three main topics . First , I investigate vectorial forces as a tool to explore the energy landscape of protein complexes . Sec - ond , I apply this method to a biologically important force transduction complex , the integrin - talin complex . Third , I use Terahertz electric ﬁelds to manipulate the energy landscape of a molecular rotor on a gold surface and drive their eﬀective rotation bidirectionally . Force is by nature a vector and depends on its three parameters : magnitude , direc - tion and attachment point . Here , the impact of diﬀerent force protocols varying these parameters is shown for an antibody - antigen complex and the ribonuclease - inhibitor complex barnase - barstar . Antibodies are essential for our adaptive immune system in their function to bind speciﬁc antigens . Here , the binding of an antibody to a peptide is probed with varying attachment points . Diﬀerent attachment points clearly change the dissociation pathways . The barriers identiﬁed using experimental atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) and molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulations are in excellent agree - ment . I determine the molecular interactions of two main barriers for each setup . This results in a common outer barrier of the complex and diﬀerent inner barriers probed by AFM . The ribonuclease barnase and its inhibitor barstar form an evolutionary optimized complex . Diﬀerent force protocols are shown to determine the hierarchy of relative stability within a protein complex . For the barnase - barstar complex , the internal fold of the barstar is identiﬁed to be less stable than the barnase - barstar binding interaction . High velocities probe the lability or barriers of the system while low velocities probe the stability or energy wells of this system . Forces impact biological life on totally diﬀerent length scales which range from whole organisms to individual proteins . Integrins are the major cell adhesion recep - tors binding to the extracellular matrix and talin . Talin activates the integrins and creates the initial connection to the actin cytoskeleton of the cell . Here , I have chosen to investigate the integrin - talin complex as a biologically important force transduc - 3 Abstract tion complex . The force dependence of the system is probed by constant force MD simulations . The two main results include the activation of the complex and its force response . I demonstrate , that the binding of talin to integrin does not disrupt the integrin’s transmembrane helix interactions sterically . Since , this disruption is neces - sary for integrin activation , a modiﬁed activation mechanism requiring a small force application is proposed . The response of the integrin - talin complex normal and par - allel to the cell membrane is analyzed . The complete dissociation pathways generated for both directions identify a force - induced formation of a stabilizing beta strand be - tween integrin and talin only for normal forces . Furthermore , the complex tries to rotate such that the external force aligns with the more force resistant axis of the complex . In nature , molecular rotors are essential building blocks of many molecular ma - chines and brownian motors like the F1 - ATPase or the ﬂagellum of a bacterium . The direction of rotation often steers diﬀerent processes in clockwise and counterclockwise directions . Rotation on the nanoscopic level in artiﬁcial devices is still very limited and requires a deeper understanding . In my last project , I study the switching and driving of a molecular diethylsulﬁd rotor on a gold ( 111 ) surface by Terahertz electric ﬁelds . The response of the rotational energy landscape to static and oscillation elec - tric ﬁelds is analyzed . Varying the Terahertz driving frequency , the rotation direction and frequency are controlled . A theoretical framework is presented to describe the behavior of the molecular rotor . This can be seen as the ﬁrst step into the direction of man - made controllable nano - devices driven and controlled by energy from the electric wall - socket . 4 1 Introduction Biological life arose from inorganic matter by forming a ﬁrst generation of organic macromolecules 1 . These macromolecules gained the ability of self - organization and self - replication . Life evolved from single - to multi - cellular organisms . Today , all or - ganisms depend on the functional interaction of highly specialized molecular nanoma - chines , the proteins . How can you gain insight into the nanoscopic world of life on the molecular level ? The answer lies in the combination of diﬀerent approaches . This highly interdisci - plinary research area , the life sciences , complement each other by accumulating ideas and exchanging methods and knowledge from physics , biology , chemistry , computer sciences and medicine . It can be subdivided into many ﬁelds of active research . One of these ﬁelds is biophysics . In this interdisciplinary ﬁeld , physical toolkits and meth - ods are used to study biological building blocks and systems . My contribution to this ﬁeld is the examination and manipulation of the energy landscape of protein - protein complexes using molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulations . In addition to these mechan - ical manipulations I study the control of a non - deterministic molecular rotor with Terahertz electric ﬁelds . Protein function and protein - protein interactions are determined by their dynam - ics as well as by their stability 2 . In the past 15 years , observing protein internal dynamics became possible due to advanced experimental methods like nuclear mag - netic resonance ( NMR ) relaxation experiments 3 – 5 . Förster resonance energy transfer 5 1 Introduction ( FRET ) experiments can be used to study protein folding , protein - protein interac - tions and in vivo protein transport or turnover 6 – 9 . Single - molecule force spectroscopy like atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) or optical traps can detect forces resulting from conformational changes , binding or activation events . The unfolding and refolding of titin and bacteriorhodopsin 10 – 12 or the ligand dependent ﬂuctuations of calmodulin 13 are prominent examples ( For details on AFM see Section 2 . 2 . 4 ) . However , experimental techniques are not capable to yield insight into protein dy - namics on the atomistic level , yet . Therefore , computer simulations can be used to complement experimental techniques 14 . Molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulations in - tegrate classical Newton dynamics using empirical force ﬁelds to simulate the time development of a system . An ever increasing amount of computational power 15 , 16 and improving algorithms allow to reach increasing system sizes and simulation timescales from picoseconds up to a few milliseconds 17 . Large systems with a few million atoms like the simulation of virus capsids 18 , 19 or large macromolecules like a ribosome 20 , 21 can be simulated . Simulations of the NTL9 ( 1 - 39 ) identify a set of 1 . 5 ms long fold - ing pathways 17 . Even though , biological processes and transitions may require even longer times under equilibrium conditions . A reduction of the system size using a coarse graining or the use of implicit water can speed up the simulation at the cost of reduced accuracy . Parallel approaches like replica exchange molecular dynamics simulate the system at multiple temperatures 22 or intelligent sampling methods like the Markov Model approach in the NTL9 protein folding can optimize the sampling of slow processes within a given computational time 23 . Since the protein dynamics is determined by their potential energy landscape , the addition of a potential can speed up such processes . Conformational ﬂooding like methods employ artiﬁcial potentials destabilizing sampled conformations 24 , 25 . The drawbacks are that the system can neither be dynamically steered nor mimicked by experiments . In this work , we use mechanical and electric energy to inﬂuence the energy landscape of the chosen sys - tems . Mechanical forces are used to achieve optimal steering of the transitions along the chosen reaction coordinate by tilting the energy landscapes . The application of forces in MD simulations is realized by mimicking AFM ex - 6 periments . Harmonic potentials are used as analogon to mechanical springs which can manipulate individual atoms , residues or chains . Combining MD simulations and experiments enable to identify the key events in force - induced unfolding of the titin immunoglobulin domain I27 26 or in the exploration of the energy landscape of the antibody fragment H6 binding to the leucine zipper GCN4 - p1 antigen 27 ( Section 3 . 2 ) . Furthermore , MD simulations are challenged to gain predictive character and ﬁrst successes have been made 14 . For example , the talin rod unfolding simulations predicted decryption of hidden vinculin binding sites under force 28 . This eﬀect has been conﬁrmed by magnetic tweezer , total internal reﬂection and AFM measurements approximately one year later 29 . Forces are characterized by their magnitude , their direction and their speciﬁc at - tachment point . These three characteristics determine the inﬂuence of the applied force on the system and its evolution . An example for the importance of the direc - tion and attachment point of forces is the well studied molecule ubiquitin . Chains of ubiquitin molecules linked by diﬀerent covalent bonds are found in nature . It is shown by single molecule force experiments and computer simulations that the me - chanical stability of ubiquitin depends on the attachment points of the force 30 – 32 . The application of forces at diﬀerent attachment points to a protein is also used by the group of Prof . M . Rief to probe the green ﬂuorescent protein ( GFP ) molecule with single molecule force measurements . They gain the unfolding energy landscape of the GFP and can model the dependence on the force application to the molecule with an elastic bond network 33 – 35 . The choice of the force application may critically inﬂuence the results of experiments and simulations . Life at the molecular level is not based on the function of isolated proteins , but on a ﬁnely choreographed interplay of proteins interacting with each other and their environment . Thus , this work focusses on studying the examination of protein - protein interactions . My ﬁrst project in cooperation with Dr . J . Morﬁll and Prof . H . E . Gaub combines experimental AFM measurements with MD simulations to explore the en - ergy landscape of an antibody binding to a target peptide . The binding site of the complex is not only deﬁned by the binding energy since its dissociation pathways 7 1 Introduction diﬀers for each force attachment point . The combined eﬀorts of experiments and sim - ulations could identify a two barrier unbinding with the higher barrier being dominant in the equilibrium dissociations and the lower barrier with the smaller potential width to be dominating the AFM results . The SMD simulations could identify the atomistic interactions for each barrier ( Section 3 . 2 ) . My second project intensiﬁes the studies on the inﬂuence of diﬀerent applied force vectors to protein complexes . The well studied and highly stable barnase barstar complex serves as a model complex . The eﬀect of attachment points , geometry and loading rates of the applied forces are studied . A high loading rate ( fast pulling ) is shown to test the lability of the energy landscape . Slow changes address the stability of the system . The ﬁnal conformational state of the unbound proteins strongly depended on the force attachment points . The individual folds of both binding partners are shown to be less stable than the protein - protein binding site ( Section 3 . 3 ) . Forces are not only a tool to explore and examine proteins . Many biological sys - tems experience forces in a physiological environment . For example , the gigantic titin protein fulﬁlls an essential passive role in muscle contraction and elasticity 26 , 37 . The enzymatic role of the titin kinase has been shown to be actively regulated by forces 38 . On the cellular level tension plays an important role . Cells forming tis - sues interact with each other as well as with the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) 39 – 41 . In this context , adhesion forces and force sensing of the environment are essential . Integrins are the major class of cell adhesion receptors which mediate cell - cell and cell - ECM interactions . Furthermore , they transmit bidirectional signals and forces between ECM and their cytoplasmic domain 42 , 43 . The integrins play central roles in cellular adhesion , migration , apoptosis , development and immune responses 44 , 45 . For functional adhesions , the integrins need to be connected to the cytoskeleton of the cell 46 . Recent three - dimensional interferometric photoactivated localization mi - croscopy ( iPALM ) measurements showed that the talin molecules bridge the cyto - plasmic gap between integrins and the cytoskeleton 47 . Talin is an essential adaptor protein which activates the integrins on the inside - out signaling pathway 48 . It is com - posed of the head domain binding the integrin and its rod domain binding the actin 8 cytoskeleton . The rod domain is shown to decrypt hidden vinculin binding sites under force to allow additional mechanical stabilization 29 , 49 . Recently , structures of the in - tegrins transmembrane region 50 is solved by NMR , while the integrin - talin complex 51 and the complete talin head group 52 are solved by X - ray crystallography . This allows to study the integrin - talin complex by MD simulations . In my third project I focus on the direct interface of the integrin - talin complex by simulating the complex under equilibrium conditions and analyze the ﬂuctuation behavior of the integrin residues . Finally , I probe the integrin - talin complex with constant forces in the range of 20 - 500 pN in diﬀerent directions and identify the residues important for the mechanical stability of the complex . These residues are highly conserved and show strong binding . The force response of the complex is found to to be direction dependent . Further , I determine a force induced formation of an intermolecular beta - sheet which stabilizes the integrin - talin complex against forces normal to the plane of the cell membrane . This is the key mechanism in the self - strengthening force response of the complex . Based on these results , we proposed a force dependent activation of the integrin extending a recently published mechanism by Anthis et al . 51 . More details can be found in Chapter 4 . My last project is a cooperation with Prof . R . D . Astumian . Complementing my previous work , the energy landscape of a molecular diethylsulﬁde ( DES ) rotor on a gold ( 111 ) surface is now inﬂuenced by Terahertz electric ﬁelds instead of by mechan - ical forces . But why should we study molecular rotation ? Since the invention of the wheel approx . 4000 BC , rotation in the macroscopic world is part of our daily lives . Cars , engines or soccer - so much depends on rotation . In the nanoscopic world ro - tations are as widely spread as in the macroscopic . Rotations occur around chemical bonds or in essential machines like the F1 - ATPase 53 or the bacterial ﬂagellar motor 54 . However , the behavior of macroscopic systems is diﬀerent from nanoscopic ones . Low Reynolds numbers and high thermal noise dominate the behavior of many nanoscopic systems 55 , 56 . The harvesting of molecular rotation for biotechnological devices or a deep understanding of rotational concepts are yet to be achieved . Our system is a minimal system of a small molecule rotating on a periodically structured surface in 9 1 Introduction vacuum . It has been studied experimentally with a scanning tunneling microscope ( STM ) by the group of Prof . E . C . H . Sykes 57 . We use parallel static and oscillating electric ﬁelds to characterize and drive the molecular rotor depending on its confor - mational state . The intrinsic energy landscape dependent on the rotational angle and the current ﬁeld is simulated . The rotor’s frequency response on the external electric ﬁeld could be modeled with two main contributions at the characteristic frequency and at twice its value . Thus , we provide a theoretical framework for the understand - ing of electric driving of surface mounted rotational motion . Details can be found in Chapter 5 . This theory can be used as a ﬁrst step to design biotechnical applications driven by surface mounted molecular rotors in the GHz regime . This may be a ﬁrst step to fuel molecular machines like the F1 - ATPase in a highly parallel way directly by electric current from a power socket . In summary , I focussed on gaining a better understanding of manipulating and exploring molecular devices like proteins and rotors by ﬁne tuned manipulation via mechanical or electrical energies . 10 2 Theory This chapter describes the theoretical frameworks and basic methods on which this dissertation is based on . Speciﬁc biological details and particular methods used in the projects can be found in Chapters 3 . 2 - 5 2 . 1 Molecular Dynamics simulations The main method of my thesis are MD simulations . These computer simulations cal - culate the dynamics of molecular systems like proteins , rotors or membranes using statistical mechanics and Newton’s equation of motion in atomistic detail . MD simu - lations are based on the following three main approximations . Textbooks on MD can give further insight 58 , 59 . 2 . 1 . 1 Born - Oppenheimer approximation Aim : Separation of motion into time - independent electron and time - dependent atomic nuclei motion . The time - dependent Schrödinger equation describes the time evolution of a quan - tum system . H Ψ = i (cid:126) δ Ψ δt ( 2 . 1 ) 11 2 Theory where the Hamiltonian H describes the sum of potential and kinetic energy . Ψ is the wave function which contains the information about all particles of the system and (cid:126) the Planck constant divided by 2 π . Since the analytical calculation of the exact solution of the Schrödinger equation for multiple nuclei and electrons is not possible , Max Born and J . Robert Oppenheimer proposed to decouple the motion of the atomic nuclei from the motion of the elec - trons 60 . If the velocity of the atomic nuclei is small compared to the electrons , it can be assumed that the electrons adapt to the state of the atomic nuclei adiabatically and instantaneously . As a result the wave function Ψ of the complete system can be written as a product of the time - dependent wave function of the atomic nuclei Ψ n and the time - independent electron wave function Ψ e Ψ ( R , r , t ) = Ψ n ( R , t ) Ψ e ( r ; R ) ( 2 . 2 ) where R = ( R 1 , R 2 , . . . , R N ) and r = ( r 1 , r 2 , . . . , r K ) are the coordinates of the N nuclei and the K electrons , respectively . The wave function Ψ e of the electronic subsystem depends only on the coordinates R and not on the velocities v R of the nuclei . Thus , the electronic subsystem is solved given ﬁxed nuclei positions R by H e ( R ) Ψ e ( r ; R ) = E e ( R ) Ψ e ( r ; R ) . ( 2 . 3 ) The electric Hamiltonian H e = H − H n can be expressed as the Hamiltonian of the complete system H minus the Hamiltonian of the nuclei H n . The energy eigenvalues E e ( R ) of eq . 2 . 3 represent the potential energy surface . By applying 2 . 2 and 2 . 3 to 2 . 1 , the following time - dependent Schrödinger equation for the atomic nuclei can be obtained : ( T n + E e ( R ) ) Ψ n ( R , t ) = i (cid:126) δ Ψ n ( R , t ) δt ( 2 . 4 ) T n is the kinetic energy of the nuclei . The Born - Oppenheimer approximation is valid as long as the electronic eigenvalues E e of eq . 2 . 3 are not overlapping . This can 12 2 . 1 MD Simulations usually be assumed for molecules in the ground state . 2 . 1 . 2 Classical dynamics Aim : Speed up simulations by treating large quantum mechanical systems with clas - sical physics . Due to the large number of atoms in current MD simulations , the calculation of the molecular dynamics is restricted to the motion of the atomic nuclei . Further - more , solving the time - dependent Schrödinger equation of the system would be too time consuming . Therefore , the nuclei are treated as classical particles ( Ehrenfest theorem 61 ) with a potential energy V ( R ) = E 0 e ( R ) ( 2 . 5 ) with the potential energy surface of the ground state E 0 e ( R ) according to eq . 2 . 3 . The motion of the nuclei is described by Newton mechanics : F i = m i · a i ( 2 . 6 ) −∇ R i V ( R ) = m i · δ 2 R i δt 2 ( 2 . 7 ) with the force F i and the acceleration a i acting on the i th atom of the system . The time evolution of the system is calculated in small time steps ∆ t by the leap - frog algorithm 62 : v i ( t + ∆ t 2 ) = v i ( t − ∆ t 2 ) + F i ( t ) m i · ∆ t ( 2 . 8 ) R i ( t + ∆ t ) = R i ( t ) + v i ( t + ∆ t 2 ) · ∆ t . ( 2 . 9 ) These equations are solved iteratively every time step resulting in trajectories of po - sitions R ( t ) ( and velocities v ( t ) = ( v 1 ( t ) , v 2 ( t ) , . . . , v N ( t ) ) ) for all atoms ( i = 1 , 2 , . . . , N ) 13 2 Theory in the system . The time step ∆ t of the simulation is restricted to 1 fs by the fastest relaxation times of the system , the bond and angle vibrations involving hydrogen atoms . These bond vibrations do not generally couple to the global protein domain motions . They can be constrained by algorithms like LINCS to increase the time step to 2 - 4 fs 63 . 2 . 1 . 3 Force ﬁelds Aim : Replace solving of electronic Schrödinger equation by using empirical potentials . Figure 2 . 1 : This ﬁgure indicates the diﬀerent types of potentials used for a force ﬁeld . MD simulations require a potential energy landscape V ( R ) to describe the atomic interactions in the system . The Born - Oppenheimer approximation reduces this prob - lem to a time - independent Schrödinger equation which depends on the positions of 14 2 . 1 MD Simulations the nuclei of the system only . Due to the large number of electrons in proteins , the computational costs are to high to solve equation 2 . 3 . Thus , the potential energy surface is approximated by a force ﬁeld V ( R ) . It is build from classical potential energy expressions and their associated adjustable parameters 64 . Pairwise additivity of these energy terms is usually assumed . Figure 2 . 1 illustrates the main energy terms contributing to a Force Field V ( R ) . The bonded energy terms describe bond stretching ( V bond ) , angle bending ( V angle ) and torsion around dihedral angles ( V dih ) . The non - bonded terms are the Lennard - Jones ( V LJ ) and Coulomb ( V Coul ) potentials . V ( R ) = V bond + V angle + V torsion + V LJ + V Coulomb ( 2 . 10 ) = (cid:88) bonds k b 2 ( l − l eq ) 2 + (cid:88) angles k θ 2 ( θ − θ eq ) 2 + (cid:88) dihedrals V n 2 ( 1 + cos ( n Φ − δ ) ) + (cid:88) pairs i , j 4 (cid:15) ij (cid:20)(cid:18) σ ij R ij (cid:19) 12 − (cid:18) σ ij R ij (cid:19) 6 (cid:21) + q i q j 4 π(cid:15) 0 R ij ( 2 . 11 ) The bond and angle force ﬁeld parameters are the force constants k b , k θ , the equilib - rium angles θ eq and equilibrium bond lengths l eq . The torsion potential is described by it multiplicity n , its barrier height V n and its phase δ . Improper dihedrals are treated analog to normal angles . The non - bonded parameters are the partial charges q i and the Lennard - Jones ( LJ ) parameters (cid:15) ij and σ ij . Further details can be found in the review by Prof . W . L . Jorgensen 64 . In this thesis , the classical OPLS all atom force ﬁeld is used for all protein - protein interaction projects ( Chapters 3 . 2 - 4 ) 65 . For the simulation of the molecular rotor on gold in Chapter 5 the GolP force ﬁeld is applied . It is optimized to describe peptide adsorption to gold in vacuum 66 . 15 2 Theory 2 . 1 . 4 Simulation details In this subsections , some general details of MD simulations used in this thesis are discussed . All MD simulations are performed using the GROMACS software pack - age 67 – 70 . Further technical details can be found in the GROMACS manual 71 . Explicit water and periodic boundary conditions Proteins do not only interact with other proteins , but their natural environment features membranes , macromolecules , ions and water as interaction partners . For simulating protein - protein interactions the complexes are solvated in explicit water with physiological concentrations of sodium chloride . Periodic boundary conditions are used to minimize artifacts caused by boundaries 58 with simulation boxes large enough to accommodate all simulated conformations of each system properly . Non - bonded interactions The most time consuming step in MD simulations is the calculation of the non - bonded interactions . The number of interactions scales with O ( N 2 ) quadratically with the number of the atoms N in the simulated system ( double sum in eq . 2 . 11 ) . To improve the scaling for large systems , the with R − 6 fast decaying LJ interactions are typically cut oﬀ between 1 . 0 to 1 . 4 nm . The long ranging Coulomb interactions decay slowly with R − 1 and cannot simply be cutoﬀ 72 . Therefore , the Particle - Mesh Ewald ( PME ) algorithm scaling with O ( NlogN ) is used 73 . Here , the interaction potential V Coul is separated into a short ranged term V sr and a long ranged term V lr . By calculating the short ranged term in real space and the long - ranged term in reciprocal space using Fast Fourier Transformation with a discrete mesh both terms converge quickly 74 . 16 2 . 1 MD Simulations Temperature coupling The temperature T in MD simulations is deﬁned by the kinetic energy E kin of the system 70 E kin = (cid:88) atoms i m i 2 v 2 i = 1 2 N f k B T ( 2 . 12 ) with N f degrees of freedom , the Boltzmann constant k B , the velocity v i and mass m i of the i th atom . Numerical integration , approximation of non - bonded interactions or dissipative work done on the system can change the temperature T of a ( sub ) system . Coupling the simulation box to a large temperature bath with a ﬁxed reference temperature T 0 can correct this eﬀect . Therefore , the Berendsen algorithm 75 is based on extending the simple Newtonian equation 2 . 6 to a Langevin formulation by introducing a friction and a stochastic term , using a Gaussian stochastic variable ξ i with zero mean . m i · ˙v i = F i − m i 2 τ T v i + ξ i ( t ) ( 2 . 13 ) (cid:104) ξ i ( t ) ξ j ( t + τ T ) (cid:105) = m i τ T k B T 0 δ ( τ T ) δ ij ( 2 . 14 ) It eﬀectively rescales the velocities of the particles ( v (cid:48) = λv ) with a factor λ = (cid:115) 1 + ∆ t τ T (cid:18) T 0 T − 1 (cid:19) ( 2 . 15 ) with the coupling time constant τ T and the integration time step ∆ t . The change in temperature is then described by d T ( t ) d t = 1 τ T ( T 0 − T ( t ) ) . ( 2 . 16 ) The Berendsen thermostat does not result in a well - deﬁned ensemble . Depending on the coupling time constant τ T something between a micro canonical and a canonical ensemble is created 76 . In 2007 the velocity rescaling algorithm was developed to allow 17 2 Theory a canonical distribution . It can be understood as a Berendsen thermostat with an added stochastic term including Wiener noise d W 77 d T ( t ) d t = 1 τ T ( T 0 − T ( t ) ) + 2 (cid:115) T 0 T ( t ) N f τ T d W d t . ( 2 . 17 ) The velocity rescaling algorithm is used in the more recent integrin / talin and rotor projects . Pressure coupling For the equilibration of the systems , a Berendsen pressure coupling is used 75 . Analog with the temperature coupling the system is coupled to an external pressure bath . The box vectors are scaled to decay toward a chosen reference pressure P 0 by d P ( t ) d t = 1 τ P ( P 0 − P ( t ) ) ( 2 . 18 ) . where τ P is the time constant for the pressure coupling . 18 2 . 2 Force measurements on proteins 2 . 2 Force measurements on proteins The examination of the protein - protein interactions using directed force vectors re - quires a background about proteins . Their energy landscape and kinetic interaction models in equilibrium and under force are reviewed . Relevant force probe techniques will complement this section . 2 . 2 . 1 Protein structure Proteins have diﬀerent levels of internal structure and organization ( Figure 2 . 2 ) . Their basic building blocks are the amino acids . The 22 diﬀerent standard amino acids can be connected via peptide bonds . The sequence of amino acids is called the primary structure of a protein . The functional form of a protein is a complex three dimensional structure . It has two structural main motifs : α - helices and β - sheets , also called secondary structure elements . These are stabilized by hydrogen bond interactions and connected via ﬂexible loops . The ﬁnal three dimensional structure of a single protein is called the tertiary structure of the protein . Its formation is often driven by non - speciﬁc hydrophobic interactions and stabilized by hydrogen bonds , salt - bridges , van - der - Waals interactions and / or disulﬁde bonds . A complex of multiple proteins is called a quaternary structure . It is stabilized by the same interactions as a tertiary structure 79 . The calculation of the three dimensional protein structure from its amino acid sequence is still only possible for small proteins 80 – 85 . Larger structures are solved with the help of experiments . Experimental structure determination at atomistic detail is mainly driven by X - ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) spectroscopy . Both techniques result in static structures of stable conformations . The importance of protein structures is clearly stated by the Nobel Prize in 1962 . It was awarded for the ﬁrst atomic structure of a protein using X - ray crystallography to John Kendrew and Max Perutz 86 . 19 2 Theory Figure 2 . 2 : This ﬁgure shows the diﬀerent levels of protein structure . ( Taken from Wikipedia 78 ) 2 . 2 . 2 Energy landscape of a protein The description of the protein complexes and molecules in terms of an energy land - scape is used in all projects of this thesis . The main development of this energy landscape picture for proteins was done in the ﬁeld of protein folding . The prediction of a protein structure from the knowledge of its sequence alone is one of the goals in 20 2 . 2 Force measurements on proteins proteomics . According to Anﬁnsen’s thermodynamic hypothesis , the native structure of most proteins is a thermodynamically stable structure under the given environmen - tal conditions 87 , 88 . Thus , it is independent of its kinetic folding pathway and depends only on its intrinsic high dimensional energy landscape . Figure 2 . 3 : This ﬁgure shows diﬀerent views of protein folding funnels . ( Taken from Dill et . al . 89 ) Finding the native state by a random search in a huge conformational energy land - scape would require much longer times than biological folding experiments actually do . This conﬂict is thus known as Levinthal’s paradox 89 . Figure 2 . 3 A pictures a golf course potential energy landscape on which a random walk ( e . g . by a golf ball ) 21 2 Theory would search very long to ﬁnd the minimum . Levinthal proposed a folding pathway of intermediates leading to a reduced search time . Lacking a physical basis for this model , the idea of a funnel shaped energy landscape was introduced 89 – 91 ( Fig . 2 . 3 C ) . Thus , diﬀerent pathways can lead to the same energy minimum . The progressive organization through various stages of partial folding on the way to the native struc - ture results in a rugged energy landscape 92 ( Fig . 2 . 3 D and E ) . The ruggedness of the energy landscape around the native structure allows proteins and protein complexes multiple functional conformations 93 , 94 . For a protein to function , it needs to undergo dynamic changes . The functions of a protein like enzymatic reactions , conformational changes , association or dissociation can all be understood as the protein moving on its free energy landscape . Therefore , these processes are controlled by the energy barriers , plateaus and wells in a rugged energy landscape ( Fig . 2 . 3 F ) . As protein - protein complexes are a quaternary protein structure , these protein complexes can be understood in terms of multidimensional energy landscapes as well . 2 . 2 . 3 Thermodynamics and kinetics Protein - protein complexes result from an interplay of multiple weak interactions . Only the sum of multiple interactions designs a stable connection . Force free molecular interactions A single non - covalent bond between two reac - tion partners A and B can be described by a two state model A + B ↔ AB . ( 2 . 19 ) The Arrhenius equation describes the dependence of the rate constant k of such a reaction in terms of temperature T , Boltzmann constant k B , attempt frequency ν on / oﬀ and the height of the activation energy barrier ∆ G on / oﬀ96 . In equilibrium the constant 22 2 . 2 Force measurements on proteins ( a ) Arrhenius reaction rates ( b ) 3D energy landscape ( c ) One barrier ( d ) Two barriers Figure 2 . 4 : This ﬁgure shows a 1 - dimensional potential energy landscape of a chemical bond ( Adapted from 95 ) . ( A ) The activation energy of the on / oﬀ - reactions are indicated as ∆ G on / off and the binding energy is ∆ G . ( B ) This graph shows the schematic energy landscape of a protein - protein interaction . The green and the blue lines represent diﬀerent dissociation pathways . ( C ) Applying a force results in a tilted energy landscape with an eﬀectively reduces barrier height ∆ G off . ( D ) Diﬀerent potential width of multiple barriers can lead to a shift of the global maximum position in the tilted energy landscape . 23 2 Theory binding and unbinding is driven by thermal ﬂuctuations . k 0 on = ν on e − ∆ G on kBT ( 2 . 20 ) k 0 oﬀ = ν oﬀ e − ∆ G oﬀ kBT ( 2 . 21 ) The dissociation constant K D is a measure for the stability of a bond under equilibrium conditions . It is deﬁned as K D = [ A ] [ B ] [ AB ] = k oﬀ k on = ν oﬀ ν on e − ∆ G kBT ( 2 . 22 ) Assuming ∆ G = ∆ G oﬀ − ∆ G on and ν oﬀ ≈ ν on equations 2 . 20 , 2 . 21 and 2 . 22 result in K D = k oﬀ k on = e − ∆ G k B T ( 2 . 23 ) Bell - Evans - model In many biological and experimental systems , bond dissociation occurs under dynamic load . External forces tilt the energy landscape and thus reduce the energy of the transition state . The Arrhenius equation was extended by Bell to describe this inﬂuence of external forces for cell adhesion 98 . The model was further improved by Evans 99 , 100 . The eﬀective decrease of the barrier height is determined by the applied Force F times the potential width ∆ x ( red arrow in Figure 2 . 4 C ) . For deep potentials the potential width ∆ x can be assumed to be independent of the applied force . This leads to a force dependent dissociation rate 101 k off ( F ) = ν 0 e − ∆ Goff − F · ∆ x kBT ( 2 . 24 ) = k 0 off e F · ∆ x kBT ( 2 . 25 ) with the natural vibration frequency ν 0 . From this dissociation rate the time evolution of existing bonds N B can be described as d N B d t = − k off ( t ) N B ( t ) ( 2 . 26 ) 24 2 . 2 Force measurements on proteins Integrating eq . 2 . 26 over time leads to the number of intact interactions N B : N B ( t ) = e − (cid:82) t 0 dt’ k off ( t (cid:48) ) ( 2 . 27 ) = e − (cid:82) F 0 df k off ( f ) · ˙ f − 1 ( 2 . 28 ) It is assumed , that the force can be expressed as a continuous and reversible function of time F ( t ) . The dissociation of molecular interactions are inﬂuenced by thermal ﬂuc - tuations , causing a probability distribution of unbinding forces p ( F ) . It is determined from the number of dissociated bonds ( 1 − N B ) as follows : p ( F ) = d d F ( 1 − N B ( F ) ) ( 2 . 29 ) = k off ( F ) · e − (cid:82) F 0 d fk off ( f ) · ˙ f − 1 ( 2 . 30 ) = k 0 off e F · ∆ x kBT · e − k 0 off (cid:82) F 0 df e F · ∆ x kBT · ˙ f − 1 ( 2 . 31 ) The most probable rupture force F ∗ is deﬁned by the maximum condition d p ( F ) d F = 0 . For a force independent loading rate ˙ F the most probable rupture force can be described as F ∗ ( ˙ F ) = k B T ∆ x ln (cid:18) ˙ F ∆ x k B T k 0 oﬀ (cid:19) ∝ ln ( ˙ F ) ( 2 . 32 ) The most probable rupture force shows a linear dependence on the logarithm of the loading rate ˙ F = d F d t . Thus , in the case of slow pulling ( low loading rates ) , the system has can be used to determine the natural dissociation rate k oﬀ and and the potential width ∆ x . 2 . 2 . 4 Single - molecule AFM force spectroscopy Multiple experimental techniques are available nowadays to investigate the forces on molecular systems . The most important ones are optical and magnetic tweezers , biomembrane force probe , molecular force balance as well as the atomic force micro - 25 2 Theory Figure 2 . 5 : The schematic setup of an atomic force microscope . The sample is at - tached to a piezo for positioning and to the AFM cantilever tip . The bending of the cantilever as a mechanic spring is detected via the reﬂec - tion of a laser beam on a segmented photodiode . scope ( AFM ) 102 – 106 . Here , we focus on the AFM ( Section 3 . 2 ) as a high - sensitive single molecule force spectroscopy technique . It measures and applies forces in the physio - logical picoNewton range with spactial subnanometer resolution to detect unbinding , unfolding and stretching forces of single ( bio ) molecules 33 , 34 , 37 , 107 – 109 . A schematic AFM setup is shown in Figure 2 . 5 . The cantilever , a microscopic small force sensor is the key - part of the AFM , acting as a sensitive force sensor . The cantilever bending is detected by a reﬂected laser beam on a segmented photodiode . It is described as a linear spring F = sx . The spring constant s is determined by the cantilever stiﬀness and the displacement x , measured by the deﬂection . For the examination of molecular complexes , one is bound to the cantilever probe tip and the other is immobilized on a surface mounted on the piezo . For measurement of the interactions , the cantilever tip is brought into contact with the surface , allowing 26 2 . 2 Force measurements on proteins the molecules to interact . Upon retraction of the cantilever , the applied forces are moderated by the piezoelectric actuators . Generally , the forces are applied with either a constant velocity of the retracting cantilever or as constant forces controlled by a force feedback loop . Force - extension curves are recorded by the AFM . From these , rupture forces ( the force at which a speciﬁc interaction dissociates ) and rupture lengths ( distance at which the interaction dissociates ) are determined . The corresponding loading rate is determined from the slope of the force versus time curve at the moment of the rupture event . 2 . 2 . 5 Single - molecule force probe MD simulations Even though the three approximations in Section 2 . 1 allow the simulations of molecu - lar systems on the nano - to microsecond time scale , many processes in biology require longer time scales . As mentioned in the introduction , multiple approaches are avail - able to gain insight into dynamics on a longer time scale using MD simulations . In this thesis , force probe simulations with two diﬀerent puling protocols are used : constant velocity and constant force . As discussed in Section 2 . 2 . 3 , applied forces speed up the simulated protein - protein dissociations to make them accessible with MD simulations and closely mimic the AFM experiments from the previous Section 2 . 2 . 4 . For this , one or more groups of atoms , so called pull groups , are enforced to move along a predeﬁned pulling direc - tion . Furthermore , force probe simulations give insight into protein complex reaction which are either physiologically relevant ( integrin - talin complex in Section 4 ) or are compared to experiments including force probing ( AFM experiments on the antibody - peptide complex in Section 3 . 2 . 27 2 Theory Constant velocity For constant velocity probing , a harmonic potential V spring is added to the atoms of the pull group . V spring ( t ) = s 0 2 [ R ( t ) − R spring ( t ) ] 2 ( 2 . 33 ) where s 0 is the spring constant , R ( t ) is the position of the COM of the pulled atoms and R spring ( t ) is the position of the the spring . The force F ( t ) = s 0 [ R ( t ) − R spring ( t ) ] ( 2 . 34 ) is applied by moving the spring position R spring ( t ) with constant velocity v spring along a chosen reaction coordinate R spring ( t ) = R spring ( t = 0 ) + v spring t . ( 2 . 35 ) For weak springs , the loading rate ˙ F = d F spring d t = s 0 v spring is directly proportional to the pulling velocity v spring . The pulling force F spring on the COM of a group of atoms is redistributed mass weighted to the individual atoms . Constant force In constant force mode , either a linear potential is applied to tilt the energy landscape in the direction of the reaction coordinate ( Fig . 2 . 4 ) or the force is added directly to the calculated forces for each atom of the pull group . The resulting time - independent tilt of the energy landscape permits a direct insight into the dissociation kinetics of the probed system by looking at the unfolding or dissociation lifetimes of the system . 28 2 . 3 Molecular rotors 2 . 3 Molecular rotors 2 . 3 . 1 Basic principles Since the formulation of statistical physics by Maxwell and Boltzmann , the dream of many scientists was to selectively use ﬂuctuations for driving systems . In this context it is important to keep the second law of thermodynamics in mind . Second law of thermodynamics The change of entropy d S in a closed system is related to the change in heat δQ and the temperature T via d S ≥ δQ T ( 2 . 36 ) where the equality holds for reversible and the inequality for irreversible processes . In the formulation according to Carnot : " No series of processes is possible whose sole result is the transfer of energy as heat from a thermal reservoir and the complete conversion of this energy to work . " 110 Langevin dynamics The basic behavior of a rotor is approximated by a one dimensional system interacting with a thermal bath according to a Langevin equation 111 . I d 2 θ d t 2 + Γ d θ d t − δU δθ = ξ ( T , t ) . ( 2 . 37 ) with time t , moment of inertia I , the rotation angle θ and friction constant Γ . ξ is a stochastic torque representing the thermal ﬂuctuations of the system . 29 2 Theory Fluctuation - Dissipation theorem The stochastic interaction of the rotor with the bath is divided into two terms 111 . First , the purely random stochastic torque ξ has a zero average mean (cid:104) ξ (cid:105) = 0 and is rapidly varying . Second , a slower , velocity dependent friction term Γ d θ d t inﬂuences the system if the eﬀective average rotation velocity d θ d t (cid:54) = 0 . Friction constant Γ and stochastic torque ξ ( T , t ) are correlated by the ﬂuctuation - dissipation theorem 111 Γ = 1 k B T (cid:90) ∞ 0 (cid:104) ξ ( t 0 ) ξ ( t 0 + t ) (cid:105) d t . ( 2 . 38 ) This ﬂuctuation - dissipation theorem connects the energy dissipated from the rotor by friction to the ﬂuctuations of the bath . It connects the friction to an autocorrelation of the stochastic noise term ξ weighted by the inverse thermal energy . 2 . 3 . 2 Classiﬁcation of rotors A multitude of rotors is existing . Here , I present a classiﬁcation of rotors according to the review of Kottas et al . 111 . Deﬁnition The molecular rotor consists of a stator and a rotator which can rotate against each other . The part with the larger moment of inertia is commonly regarded as the stator . The axle of the rotor carries the rotator and the rotator turns about the axle . An axle is not required for a rotor to function . For example , surface mounted R - rotors don’t have an axle ( see below ) . 30 2 . 3 Molecular rotors Classiﬁcation by structure The structure of a rotor can be classiﬁed by diﬀerent criteria summarized in Table 2 . 1 . This classiﬁcation occurs according to the chemical bond between rotator and stator , the environment of the rotor , existence and chemical nature of the axle and in case of a surface - mounted rotor the type of its mounting . These criteria are taken from the review 111 . Table 2 . 1 : Rotor classiﬁcation by structure according to review Kottas et al . 111 criteria description chemical bond • covalently bound rotator and stator • non - covalently bound rotator and stator environment • free in solution or vapor • inside solids • surface - mounted type of surface mounting • R - rotor : rotator bound to the surface ( no axle , surface = stator ) • RS - rotor : stator is ﬁxed on the surface rotation axis • free in space • perpendicular to surface ( azimuthal rotor ) • parallel to surface ( altitudinal rotor ) chemical nature of the axle • single bond • double bond ( highly hindered ) • triple bond • metal ion • no axle ( e . g . R - rotor ) Classiﬁcation by function Not only structure deﬁnes a rotor , but also its function ( Table 2 . 2 ) . As for the protein - protein interactions , the rotor motion can be described by its energy landscape ( see Section 2 . 2 . 2 ) . The rotor dynamics depend on the interplay of the various energies in a system . The energy contributions can be divided into environmental ( e . g . thermal energy ) , structural ( e . g . torsional barriers deﬁned by the structure ) and combined structural / environmental ( e . g . dipole coupling ) contributions . The rotor motion can 31 2 Theory be classiﬁed as driven or random , depending on the eﬀect of the external forces ( see Section 2 . 3 . 3 ) . Table 2 . 2 : Rotor classiﬁcation by function according to review Kottas et al . 111 criteria description energy contributions • environmental ( e . g . temperature ) • structural ( e . g . torsional barrier ) • environmental and structural interaction ( e . g . electric dipole coupling to applied electric ﬁeld ) barrier height • low compared to k B T - frequent reorientation • high compared to k B T - only driven rotation rotation mechanism • driven / deterministic - external force dominates dynamics • random / non - deterministic - thermal energy dominates dynamics driven rotation • forces caused by external ﬁeld • forces due to steric interactions random rotation • Brownian motion • Thermally activated hopping 2 . 3 . 3 Rotor behavior Potential energy landscape The potential energy landscape U has two main contributions : the internal torsional potential U tor and the interaction energy due to external ﬁelds U Coul . The internal torsional potential describe the potential energy versus the rotation angle in the ab - sence of external ﬁelds . A typical model is a sinusoidal description with n potential minima and a characteristic amplitude A U tor = A cos ( nθ ) . ( 2 . 39 ) The order of the symmetry of rotator and stator often deﬁne the number of po - 32 2 . 3 Molecular rotors tentials as their least common multiple . For example , a three - fold symmetric stator and a two - fold symmetric rotator have a internal torsional potential with six minima ( e . g . trans - rotor on gold in Chapter 5 ) . In this thesis , the interaction energy is cause by the external electric ﬁeld acting on the partial charge distribution of the rotator . Another example of interaction energy would be the orientation of a dipole along a rotating electric ﬁeld 112 . Depending on the relative strength of the thermal energy , the torsional barrier heights and the external ﬁeld , three typical types of motion can be described . For a dominating external ﬁeld , the rotor shows driven motion . Otherwise , the rotor is subject to random motion . For truly random motion the average change in angle is zero ( (cid:104) θ (cid:105) = 0 ) , but random rotors can achieve directional rotation . Random motion is generally subdivided into Brownian motion dominated by the thermal energy contri - bution and hindered motion dominated by the intrinsic torsional barriers of the rotor . In the following all three types of rotor motion are described . Driven motion For a driven rotor , the external forces dominate the dynamics of the rotor . The external potential V is larger than the magnitude of the internal torsional barriers 2 A and the thermal energy k B T ( V > k B T and V > 2 A ) . The rotor can be driven by forces caused by external ﬁelds or steric interactions . Three types of motion can be distinguished for a driven rotor 111 : • synchronous motion • thermal librations within the potential well • thermally activated hops to neighboring potential wells With decreasing strength of the external driving source or increasing temperature , the dominating deterministic synchronous rotation decreases and the other motions become more important . If the frictional response of the system dominates over the externally driven torque ( δVδt < Γ d θ d t ) , then the response of the rotor is a randomly 33 2 Theory driven motion and diﬀers for each cycle of the external ﬁeld . Still , an eﬀective direc - tional rotation is caused by the external ﬁeld . Brownian motion In the Brownian motion regime the motion of the rotor is dominated by thermal energy . Using d U d θ ≈ 0 to solve eq . 2 . 37 leads to (cid:104) θ 2 (cid:105) = 2 k B T Γ (cid:20) t − I Γ ( 1 − e − Γ t / I ) ) (cid:21) . ( 2 . 40 ) At long time scales t (cid:29) I Γ this reduces to a random walk . (cid:104) θ 2 (cid:105) = 2 k B T Γ t ( 2 . 41 ) For small time scales , an expansion of eq . 2 . 40 by Γ I t yields a motion with an angular velocity (cid:113) k B TI described by (cid:104) θ 2 (cid:105) = k B T I t 2 . ( 2 . 42 ) Small external ﬁelds can cause a preferred direction in this regime . Hindered motion Hindered motion is caused if the barrier height 2 A of the intrinsic torsional potential U tor are dominating ( 2 A > k B T and 2 A > V and 2 A > Γ d θ d t ) . The motion of the rotor is then dominated by thermal librations within the well of the intrinsic torsion potential . Thermally activated hops can move the system from one well to another with the probability P ∝ e − 2 A kBT . This gives rise to the rate of thermally activated hopping k 0 analog to eq . 2 . 20 34 2 . 3 Molecular rotors k 0 = ν 0 e − 2 A kBT ( 2 . 43 ) with the natural vibration frequency ν 0 .

Antibodies play an essential part in the adaptive immune response . They make up to 20 percent of the total amount of proteins in the blood plasma . The antibodies are collectively called immunoglobulins ( Ig ) and are produced by B - cells . Each B - cell produces only a single species of antibody with unique antigen binding sites 79 . Here , we focus on the simplest Y - shaped antibody type , the IgG molecules . Each IgG consists of two heavy and two light chains which are connected by disulﬁde bonds . At the short arms of the Y - shaped antibody there are two variable domains deﬁned by hyper - variable regions in both the heavy and light chain . This variable region is called Fv fragment and contains the complete antigen binding site . The recombinant single chain antibody Fv fragment ( scFv ) H6 is used in our work 114 . It binds a truncated GCN4 - p1 leucine zipper Y 1 HLENEVA 8 RLKK 12 . The crystal structure ( PDB : 1P4B ) 115 of this antibody - antigen complex is well known . 3 . 2 . 2 Summary We examine the inﬂuence of probing forces on the dissociation pathways of an anti - body binding its 12 amino acid antigen peptide ( Fig . 3 . 1 ) . The forces were applied using steered molecular dynamics ( SMD ) simulation and single - molecule AFM force spectroscopy . The crystal structure ( PDB : 1P4B ) 115 contains the 12 amino acid anti - gen . Three diﬀerent attachment points are chosen , the N - terminus ( setup N ) , the C - terminus ( setup C ) and the middle of the peptide at position 8 ( setup M ) . The same attachment points are probed by AFM and SMD . The AFM measurements determine the loading rate dependence of the most proba - ble rupture forces ( Fig . 4 in Ref . P1 ) . From these , diﬀerent potential widths ∆ x and dissociation rates k oﬀ are extracted for all three setups according to eq . 2 . 32 ( Table 1 in Ref . P1 ) . Setup N is the least stable ( k oﬀ = 16 . 9 · 10 − 3 s − 1 ) with the smallest 38 3 . 2 Antibody - Antigen Interaction Figure 3 . 1 : This is the antibody scFv H6 crystal structure binding the truncated GCN4 - p1 leucine zipper . The light chain is indicated in light grey and the heavy chain in dark grey . The antigen is shown as yellow helix with the attachment points for the force probing shown as spheres ( C , M and N from left to right ) . potential width ( ∆ x N = 0 . 82 nm ) . The dissociation of Setup C is 13 times slower ( k oﬀ = 1 . 3 · 10 − 3 s − 1 ) and has a 23 % larger potential width ( ∆ x C = 1 . 10 nm ) . Setup M shows intermediate values for dissociation rate ( k oﬀ = 7 . 6 · 10 − 3 s − 1 ) and potential width ( ∆ x M = 0 . 95 nm ) . The SMD simulations show diﬀerent unbinding pathways in atomistic detail for all three setups ( Figs . 7 - 9 and Table 2 in Ref . P1 ) . In all setups the peptide is zipped oﬀ starting from the force attachment point . For setup M this results in a double zipper dissociation ( Fig . 6 in Ref . P1 ) . For each setup , two main interactions with compa - rable rupture forces were identiﬁed . However , all setups share a pathway - independent main dissociation barrier in the simulation . This barrier can be attributed to the rupture of the hydrogen bond between the peptide’s GLU O(cid:15) - 6 and the heavy chain’s backbone hydrogen GLY H - H40 ( Figs . 7c , 8b and 9c in Ref . P1 ) . 39 3 Force - Based Analysis of Multidimensional Energy Landscapes In the setups N and C , the potential widths ( ∆ x N , ∆ x C ) are in good agreement with the ﬁrst rupture lengths r of the SMD simulations ( r N 1 = 0 . 88 nm and r C 1 = 1 . 03 nm ) ( Fig . 10 in Ref . P1 ) . Hence , the AFM experiments probe the ﬁrst barrier of the system attributed to diﬀerent interactions . For setup N , the hydrophobic contact of the peptides LEU - 3 with the antibody’s light chain TYR - L40 dissociates . In setup C , the hydrogen bond between the peptide residues VAL - 7 and LEU - 10 is broken and the peptide’s C - terminal helix loop opens . The SMD simulations identify a second barrier for each setup . Their longer rupture lengths ( r N 2 = 1 . 72 nm and r C 2 = 1 . 50 nm ) indicate larger potential widths . The enforced tilt of the energy landscape reduces the outer barriers more strongly . This indicates that the AFM is measuring the diﬀerent inner barriers . From the higher rupture forces and the longer rupture lengths of the ﬁrst barrier in setup C it can be assumed to have a higher ﬁrst barrier than setup N . This results in a qualitatively lower dissociation rate for setup C ( k C oﬀ < k N oﬀ , see Fig . 10 in Ref . P1 ) . Concluding , the comparison of the probed energy barriers of both methods ( AFM and SMD ) show an excellent agreement even though the loading rates of the SMD simulations exceeded those of the AFM experiments by orders of magnitudes . The direction of the applied forces in single - molecule force spectroscopy clearly deﬁne the preferred dissociation pathway on a multidimensional energy landscape of the protein complex . 3 . 2 . 3 Publication P1 Julia Morﬁll , Jan Neumann , Kerstin Blank , Uta Steinbach , Elias Puchner , Kay E .

The bacterium Bacillus amyloliquefaciens excretes the ribonuclease ( RNAse ) barnase for food degradation and protection against predators and competitors 116 . Since barnase has a lethal eﬀect on all unprotected cells , the Bacillus amyloliquefa - ciens developed the inhibitor barstar for self - protection . The crystal structure ( PDB : 1BRS ) shows that a barstar α - helix blocks the active site of the barnase 117 . The very high association rate constant of the complex ( k on = 10 8 s − 1 M − 1 ) 118 is achieved by electrostatic steering 119 – 121 . The optimal association pathway involves a region near the RNA binding site 122 , 123 . An overlap of the association and dissociation pathways has been suggested from rigid - body Brownian dynamics simulations with implicit solvent 123 . 3 . 3 . 2 Summary The antibody - antigen project shows clearly that forces can be used to examine the en - ergy landscape of a protein complex dissociation in experiment and simulation . In this project we use SMD simulations to show that the variation of force parameters can be used as a diﬀerential force assay . We examine additional variations of the geometry and velocity of force application ( Fig . 1 in Ref . P2 ) . These allow to determine the relative stability of diﬀerent protein regions within the complex against each other . For this project , we choose the small and fast binding barnase - barstar complex to op - timize the computational eﬀort 117 . In the past , the association of the barnase - barstar complex has been studied extensively under equilibrium conditions 118 – 123 . However , our simulations contribute new insight into the dynamic response of the complex un - der non - equilibrium conditions . We can switch the main dissociation pathway of a protein complex from unfolding to several unbinding pathways . In setup 1 , the inﬂu - ence of the viscous drag compensating the pulling force is increased with increasing 41 3 Force - Based Analysis of Multidimensional Energy Landscapes Figure 3 . 2 : This is the barnase - barstar complex crystal structure ( PDB : 1BRS ) 117 . The dark gray molecule is the barnase RNAse , the light grey is the barnase with a green highlighted binding helix . The light and dark grey spheres are the force attachment points for the end - to - end pulling in setups 1 and 1 m . The red sphere represents the COM of the complete barstar pulled in setup 2 , while the yellow sphere represents the COM of barstar’s binding helix pulled in setup 3 . The blue sphere represents the COM of the barnase locally restrained in setups 2 and 3 . pulling velocity . Therefore , it is important from which side the protein complex is probed ( Fig . 3A in Ref . P2 ) . Two main pathways can be identiﬁed : the energetically more costly shearing of barstar’s β - sheet and the cooperative zipper - like unbinding of the barnase’s N - terminal α - helix ( Fig . 6 in Ref . P2 ) . Given enough time in the slow pulling setups , the system prefers the unbinding of barnase’s α - helix . A rapid change of the system lacks enough time to relax orthogonally to the reaction coordinate and the lability instead of the stability of the system is tested . Thus , fast pulling can be used to study the barriers in the energy landscape . In setups 2 and 3 , barnase’s center of mass ( COM ) is restrained . In setup 2 , barstar’s 42 3 . 3 Barnase - Barstar COM is pulled away from barnase . This shows , that the intramolecular stability of barstar’s conformation is less stable than the intermolecular binding to the barnase . This is reasonable since the evolutionary pressure for the survival of the bacterium based on a blocked barnase is dominating against the conformational stability of the inhibitor as long as it still blocks ( Fig . 3B in Ref . P2 ) . The direct unbinding of the proteins is achieved by force application to the COM of the barstar’s binding helix in setup 3 ( Fig . 3C in Ref . P2 ) . Summarizing , the barnase - barstar simulations show that velocity and geometry have a strong impact on the development of the system . For an atomistic under - standing of unbinding or unfolding pathways a variety of force protocols needs to be tested . 3 . 3 . 3 Publication P2 Jan Neumann , Kay E . Gottschalk .

Integrins are the major cell adhesion receptors of cells 42 . They were optimized by evolution as a force resistant and functional interface between inside and outside of the cell . Design prin - ciples combining functional two - way signaling and mechanical force resistance could improve bioengineering of future nanoscale machinery . The understanding of integrins as major cell adhesion receptors could also lead to improved medical devices such as implant coatings resulting in less immune rejection . Integrins are important not only in cellular processes from cell migration , proliferation to apoptosis , but are also important targets for pharmaceutical research in ﬁghting inﬂammation reactions 124 , multiple sclerosis 125 , tumors 126 , 127 or HIV 128 . The importance of the integrins in basic research is highlighted by the integrin being the molecule of the month February 2011 of the international most important structure database www . pdb . org . 4 . 2 . 2 Integrin Integrins are heterodimeric transmembrane ( TM ) adhesion receptors transducing bi - directional signals and forces through the membrane 42 , 129 . They are composed of two subdomains ( α and β ) . In humans , 18 known α and 8 known β units combine to at least 24 functional adhesion receptors . Both subdomains of the integrin consist of a short cytoplasmic tail , a single TM helix and a large extracellular domain . The size of the extracellular integrin domain contains about 1000 amino acids in the α - and 750 in the β - domain 130 – 132 . The extracellular domain of the integrin has two main conformations - a passive bent switchblade and an active open switchblade ( shown in Fig . 4 . 1 ) 134 . In the passive form , the TM helices are tightly packed 135 – 137 . The α - and β - TM - helices interact via an outer and an inner membrane clasp 50 . The outer membrane clasp stabilizes the TM crossing via a glycine - packing . The inner membrane clasp consists of a hydrophobic 46 4 . 2 Biological background Figure 4 . 1 : This ﬁgure shows the α ( blue ) and β ( green ) subunits of the integrin in a passive ( left ) and an active ( right ) conformation . The bound talin is shown in violet and the bound short ﬁbrinogen peptide is shown in red . The ﬁgure was designed by David S . Goodsell and published by RCSD PDB 133 core ( α IIb - F992 / F993 - β 3 - W715 ) and a salt bridge ( α IIb - R995 - β 3 - D723 ) Integrin activation is accompanied by separation of the α - and β - TM helices 138 . The dissociation of the inner membrane clasp initiates an inside - out signaling path - way activating the integrin . This activation is caused by talin binding to the inte - grin’s cytoplasmic β - tail 48 , 131 , 139 , 140 . The separation of the extracellular integrin legs causes the outside - in signaling by initiating the dissociation of the outer membrane clasp 50 , 141 , 142 . 47 4 Force response of the integrin - talin complex Activation and deactivation of integrins can also be caused by applied forces 41 , 143 . Whether this requires vertical 41 or lateral forces 143 is currently under discussion and motivates the normal and parallel force applications in our project . 4 . 2 . 3 Talin Talin is a special ligand out of the large variety of molecules that bind the integrin , the so called integrin adhesome of more than 155 proteins 144 . Talin binding with its FERM domain to the cytoplasmic β - tail of the integrin is the essential last step in the inside - out activation of the integrins 139 , 145 , 146 . Additionally , talin binds actin with its rod domain 147 . Thus , talin acts as a force clamp between integrin and cytoskeleton . It forms the initial force transmitting link between the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) and the intracellular actin network 47 . Figure 1A in Ref . P3 shows a scheme of this force propagation pathway . Talin completes the mechanical connection from the outside of the cell to the cell’s mechanical carcass , the cytoskeleton . Additionally , the positively charged residues of the FERM domain bind to the cell membrane and enhance the integrin activation 51 , 140 , 148 , 149 . 4 . 3 Summary The integrin - talin interface is essential in the activation of the integrin and in the early stages of the force transmission from the ECM to the intracellular cytoskeleton . Here , we study the eﬀect of forces on the initial integrin - talin complex by simulating the integrin - talin interface region in the recently published complex structure of the integrin β 1 D binding to the talin - 2 FERM F3 domain 50 . A 100 ns long equilibration of this structure results in a stable complex with a root mean square deviation of the C α atoms from the initial structure of ∼ 0 . 2 nm ( Fig . 2A in Ref . P3 ) . A clustering algorithm identiﬁes the most representative structure of the dominating integrin - talin conformation . The dominating cluster represents 47 % of all frames and three times more than the second largest . From the analysis of the 48 4 . 3 Summary structure and the root mean square ﬂuctuations of the amino acids in equilibrium , three modular binding regions with more ﬂexible interconnects are identiﬁed ( Table 4 . 1 and Fig . 3 in Ref . P3 ) . The importance of these tight binding modules is conﬁrmed by a high evolutionary conservation identiﬁed using a multiple sequence alignment . Table 4 . 1 : This overview lists the three modular binding sites of the integrin we iden - tify and describes their interaction sites . integrin binding region interaction type helix 763 F . . . E 769 • hydrophobic interactions of β 1D - F 763 and β 1D - F 766 • hydrogen bonds of the charged amino acids β 1D - D 759 , β 1D - E 767 and β 1D E - 769 tryptophan W 775 • deep hydrophobic talin binding pocket • stabilization via a cation - π interaction possible NPxY motif • hydrogen network of β 1D − 780 NPIY 783 The direct environment of our simulated integrin - talin complex fragment is gener - ated ( Fig . 1B in Ref . P3 ) . We align our long time equilibrated integrin - talin complex fragment to the adjacent structures including the full talin FERM domain and the in - tegrin’s α - / β - TM helix bundle 50 – 52 . Surprisingly , no steric disturbance resulted from the α IIb - cytoplasmic tail and the talin FERM domain , both being bound to the in - tegrin β - tail at the same time . From low force pulling experiments we identify the N - terminal integrin helix near the membrane as the ﬁrst secondary structure element to unfold . We propose that this conformational change disrupts the salt bridge of the inner membrane clasp ( Fig . 9 in Ref . P3 ) . The mechanical stress resulting from the rotation of the talin head by ∼ 20 ◦ during its binding to the cell membrane might already be suﬃcient to cause these forces required for the integrin activation 51 . To identify the force response of the integrin - talin complex , constant force MD simulations ranging from 20 - 500 pN are performed with two perpendicular pulling directions . The N - terminal C α of the β 1D integrin is pulled either normal or parallel to the putative plane of the cell membrane and away from the talin - 2 F3 FERM domain . The integrin - talin COM - COM distance is evaluated as reaction coordinate . 49 4 Force response of the integrin - talin complex Dissociation of the complex within the simulation time of 20 ns starts at 200 pN for parallel forces and at 400 pN for normal forces . Thus , the mechanical force resistance of the integrin - talin complex parallel to the membrane is weaker than that normal to it . To gain an atomistic insight into the dissociation of the complex , a pathway map is generated . A peak detection algorithm determines ( meta ) stable intermediate states from the distance distributions of each force and each probing direction . The struc - tures of each state are clustered and a dissociation pathway map is generated from the representative cluster conformations ( Figs . 6 and 7 in Ref . P3 ) . From these maps , the dissociation pathways for normal and parallel pulling are clearly distinguishable . The three modular binding regions mentioned above unbind characteristically for each setup . The main diﬀerence in the dissociation is the formation of an intermolecular β - sheet which occurs only for normal pulling ( Fig . 8 in Ref . P3 ) . This force induced strengthening of the complex causes the higher normal force resistance . Ubiquitin is a prominent example for such a direction dependence of force resistant β - sheets 30 , 150 . Additional end - to - end simulations without talin restraint show a rotation of the complex . This reorientates the complex to experience the pulling forces along its more force resistant axis corresponding to the force axis of the normal force pulling setup . Summarizing , we clearly show the direction dependence of the mechanical force resistance in the integrin - talin complex . A force induced complex strengthening is attributed to the formation of an intermolecular β - sheet . A complex reorientation to allow this β - sheet formation is identiﬁed . Additionally , the steric compatibility of both integrin α - tail and talin binding to the integrin β - tail was shown . An extension of the integrin activation model 140 is proposed to require the unfolding of the membrane proximal integrin α - helix loop . 50 4 . 4 Outlook 4 . 4 Outlook As described , the talin integrin complex is the initial force resistant connection be - tween the cell’s cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix . The force induced strength - ening of the integrin - talin complex should in the next step be studied including the TM integrin , a cell membrane and possibly the talin - 2 F2 FERM domain . The intro - duction of mutations which prevent the formation of the force - induced beta - sheet at the interface can yield additional insight into the mechanical stability of the complex . Ultimately , the goal is to simulate the complete integrin activation with talin , integrin and a membrane long enough to identify a conformational change of the extracellu - lar integrin domain from passive to active state . Additionally the force transmission pathway in atomistic detail should be identiﬁed including the aforementioned system , actin and an ECM ligand . 4 . 5 Publication P3 Jan Neumann , Kay E .

The F1 - ATP synthase uses rotations to drive the chemical fuel production of adenosinetriphosphate ( ATP ) 53 , 152 . The mechanism of a bacterial ﬂagellum moves or reorientates the bacterium depending on the direction of its rota - tion 54 , 153 . But not only nature builds molecular rotors , also man - made nanodevices are in desperate need for understanding molecular rotation to improve future artiﬁcial designs . 53 5 Controlling molecular rotation on gold In this ﬁeld , unidirectional rotation 154 and electrically driven rotors 112 , 155 have been major research topics . The idea to drive a molecular rotor as a parametric pump was ﬁrst introduced by Horinek et al . to describe a sub - harmonic rotor response 155 . This deterministic rotor is subject to a changing energy landscape . The electric ﬁeld is directly coupling to the dipole moment of the rotor . The position of the energy barriers and energy wells exchange due to the oscillatory driving . In the slow adiabatic limit , the rotor follows exactly the minima positions and rotates at the same frequency as the external ﬁeld . In the parametrically driven mode , the ﬁeld is changing slightly faster than the rotor can respond . Thus , it rotates every second cycle and is reﬂected at a forming barrier every other cycle . 5 . 3 Summary In our simulations a diethylsulﬁd ( DES ) rotor on a gold ( 111 ) surface is simulated ( Fig . 5 . 1 A ) . It was modeled analogously to low temperature STM experiments in which the rotor behavior was experimentally observed on a single - molecule level 57 . The ﬂexibil - ity of the molecular rotors and the eﬀective surface interaction are important for the rotational dynamics of this system 156 . The observed temperature ﬂuctuations even at low temperatures make it a simple and dynamic system to study non - deterministic driving of molecular rotation and allow extensive sampling in computer simulations . We chose to examine the DES rotor by means of Molecular Dynamics ( MD ) simula - tions and its behavior under the inﬂuence of externally applied static and oscillating electric ﬁelds . It is a surface - mounted azimuthal R - rotor bound to the gold via a sulfur gold bond ( Table 2 . 1 ) . Studying the basics of rotation in non - deterministic systems is essential for further development of nanotechnology . Our research aims at highly eﬃcient artiﬁcial rotors driven classically by externally controlled devices such as parallel electric ﬁelds of long wavelength infrared light . Here , we show how to control the rotational behavior of a simple surface mounted rotor using Terahertz electric ﬁelds perpendicular to the surface . Furthermore , we introduce a general theoretical framework to model 54 5 . 3 Summary Figure 5 . 1 : ( A ) Three conformations of the Diethylsulﬁd rotor on gold ( 111 ) surface are shown with indicated rotation angle θ . ( B ) The partial charges in the rotor ( δ + = 0 . 1675 e , δ − = − 0 . 3350 e ) are inﬂuenced by the external electric ﬁeld . ( C ) The potential energy landscape U ( θ , (cid:126)E ) described by eq . 5 . 1 versus the rotation angle θ is plotted for high , neutral and low electric ﬁelds . ( D ) Scheme of the diﬀerent driving regimes for the trans - 1 conformation . 55 5 Controlling molecular rotation on gold bidirectional rotation caused by a combination of external driving and parametric pumping of a non - deterministic system . The isolated rotor has two intrinsic conformations - cis and trans ( Fig . 5 . 1 A ) . Both conformations split in two sub - states when the rotor is bound to the gold ( 111 ) surface . The cis states ( cis - 1 and cis - 2 ) can be transformed into one another with a rotation by 180 ◦ . The trans states ( trans - 1 and trans - 2 ) can only interconvert by conformational change of the molecule , not by rotation around their sulfur - gold bond . The rotor’s partial charges can be inﬂuenced directly with an electric ﬁeld ( Fig . 5 . 1 B ) . All ﬁelds were perpendicular to the gold surface and the plane of rotation . From static ﬁeld simulations we could characterize the potential energy landscapes of the diﬀerent rotor conformations and for diﬀerent electric ﬁeld strengths ranging from - 9 to + 9 V / nm ( Fig . 5 . 1 C , Fig . 2 in Ref . P4 ) . The torsional energy landscape U with n energy minima per full cycle was ﬁtted by U ( θ , (cid:126)E ) = A ( (cid:126)E ) cos [ nθ + Φ ( (cid:126)E ) ] ( 5 . 1 ) Both amplitude A and phase shift Φ depend on the external ﬁeld (cid:126)E for the trans conformations . The phase shift Φ has a diﬀerent sign for trans - 1 and trans - 2 ( Fig . 2 in Ref . P4 ) . As expected from the second law of thermodynamics , no eﬀective driving is detected with static electric ﬁelds . However , the rotational diﬀusion decreases from negative to positive external ﬁelds . The phase shift Φ is constant for the cis states . The Terahertz oscillating ﬁeld (cid:126)E ( t ) = E 0 cos ( ωt ) can drive an eﬀective rotation of the rotor . How is this possible with the potential energy landscape of the rotor U ( θ , (cid:126)E ) being symmetric at every instant of time ? The answer is that the asymmetry necessary for the driving is induced with the coupled time - dependence of phase shift Φ [ (cid:126)E ( t ) ] and amplitude A [ (cid:126) E ( t ) ] . The oscillating phase shift eﬀectively oscillates the position of the minimum while the amplitude oscillates the barrier heights . The direction and eﬀective rotation rate depend also on the driving frequency ω ( ranging from 1 . 5 to 7 . 5 T Hz ) . The oscillation of the energy minimum causes an oscillation of the peak of the angle distribution around the minimum position . The phase shift between 56 5 . 3 Summary the minimum position and the population peak of the rotor depends on the driving frequency . For certain driving frequencies , the peak population experiences eﬀectively a diﬀerent barrier height for forward and backward rotations due to the coupled barrier height oscillations . Thus , a directed rotation depending on the external driving frequency is caused ( Fig . 5 . 1 , Fig . 3 in Ref . P4 ) . The equation of motion for the rotor motion driven by an external ﬁeld (cid:126)E and thermal noise ξ ( t ) is similar to eq . 2 . 37 : I d 2 θ d t 2 + Γ d θ d t − δU ( θ , (cid:126)E ) δθ = ξ ( t ) . ( 5 . 2 ) From this a librational frequency ω 0 = n (cid:113) A ( 0 ) I . Using a reduced mass of 15 amu , n = 6 for the trans conformation and an amplitude of 1 k B T , we calculate ω 0 = 2 . 4 THz . Inspired by the knowledge of a combined external and parametric driving , the following equation describes the eﬀective rotation except for a scaling factor J = J max (cid:26) τ − 1 ( ω − ω 0 ) 1 + [ 2 τ − 1 ( ω − ω 0 ) ] 2 + 1 1 + [ 2 τ − 1 ( ω − 2 ω 0 ) ] 2 (cid:27) ( 5 . 3 ) using three parameters , the characteristic librational frequency ω 0 of approximately 2 . 8 THz and the damping frequency τ − 1 which is a bit less than half the librational frequency and the maximum rotation frequence J max . The ﬁrst term expresses the external driving as a Lorentz oscillator and the second term describes the parametric pumping at double the librational frequency 2 ω 0 . The mirror symmetric rotor confor - mations trans - 1 and trans - 2 are driven in diﬀerent directions . The cis - states without oscillating phase shift do not show directional rotation , but only frequency - dependent diﬀusion . Concluding , we can control bidirectional rotation of a molecular rotor using Tera - hertz electric ﬁelds . The structural design of the rotor molecule determines the most eﬀective rotation rate and the preferred directionality of rotation . Both rotation 57 5 Controlling molecular rotation on gold rate and directionality can be tuned by varying the external driving frequency . A theoretical framework is presented to describe the rotation with only two parameters . 5 . 4 Outlook Design principles for a tunable rotor with the three states rotating clockwise , rotat - ing counterclockwise and a random / locked state are suggested . Furthermore , these simulations can be the starting point for experimental studies to break microscopic and macroscopic reversibility in molecular systems . This is a ﬁrst step in the direc - tion of connecting molecular machines driven by a rotation to the electric wall socket . The neutral rotor and the parallel electric driving ﬁeld perpendicular to the surface both allow an easy parallelization of many rotors . The eﬀective rotation requires no metal surface but only a surface breaking the symmetry of the rotor . Here , we used a threefold symmetric gold and a twofold symmetric trans - conformation . This allows the rotor to be directly mounted on protein machinery . Our rotor is a proof of prin - ciple . Many optimizations need to be explored until a ﬁnal product can be achieved . Important steps on this road are : • Increase the coupling eﬃciency of the rotor to the external ﬁeld by increasing the dipole moment perpendicular to the surface • Develop a surface pattern which prefers a rotor conformation . This might allow a GHz puls which accelerates conformational switching to reset a majority of the rotors to a desired conformation . • Develop a rotor with only one possible rotation on the surface and a method to securely couple it in the right orientation 58 5 . 5 Publication P4 5 . 5 Publication P4 Jan Neumann , Kay .

In order to explore the energy landscape and its implications on the dynamic function of proteins dynamic force spectroscopy and steered molecular dynamics ( SMD ) simulations have proved to be important tools . In this study , these techniques have been employed to analyze the influence of the direction of the probing forces on the complex of an antibody fragment with its peptide antigen . Using an atomic force microscope , experiments were performed where the attachment points of the 12 amino acid long peptide antigen were varied . These measurements yielded clearly distinguishable basal dissociation rates and potential widths , proving that the direction of the applied force determines the unbinding pathway . Complementary atomistic SMD simulations were performed , which also show that the unbinding pathways of the system are dependent on the pulling direction . However , the main barrier to be crossed was independent of the pulling direction and is represented by a backbone hydrogen bond between Gly H - H40 of the antibody fragment and Glu O ε - 6 peptide of the peptide . For each pulling direction , the observed barriers can be correlated with the rupture of specific interactions , which stabilize the bound complex . Furthermore , although the SMD simulations were performed at loading rates exceeding the experimental rates by orders of magnitude due to computational limitations , a detailed comparison of the barriers that were overcome in the SMD simulations with the data obtained from the atomic force microscope unbinding experiments show excellent agreement . © 2008 Elsevier Ltd .

The corresponding complexation rates of a protein – protein interaction are determined by the barriers in the underlying energy landscape ( Fig . 1a ) that can be influenced by a variety of internal and external factors such as phosphoryla - tion , mutations , or even the action of external forces . All these factors can alter the relative energy barrier height between different substates or even generate new local substates . Since force is an ideal control parameter to explore the multidimensional energy landscape of a protein ( Fig . 1b ) , single - molecule force spectroscopy expe - riments have become an important tool for study - ing the dynamic function of individual proteins and protein – protein complexes . 4 – 10 Technically , the appli - cation of forces on the single - molecule level can be realized using different experimental techniques as well as molecular dynamics simulations . The atomic force microscope ( AFM ) and laser tweezers have evolved into the most prominent experimental tools for the analysis of the mechanical and dissocia - tion properties of proteins and protein – protein interactions . 11 – 14 Here , the energy landscape of an antibody frag - ment – peptide complex was explored using single - molecule force spectroscopy and molecular dyna - mics simulations . We chose this system because the crystal structure of the complex is known , 15 and therefore provides the possibility of explaining the response of this complex to the externally applied force with structural data . The peptide antigen was derived from the leucine zipper domain of the yeast transcription factor GCN4 . For the generation of antibodies , two proline mutations have been intro - duced into this 33 amino acid long peptide to prevent coiled coil formation . Using this peptide , mice have been immunized and the mouse antibody genes derived from the spleen cells have been cloned into a ribosome display system to select and improve peptide binders . 15 , 16 The antibody single - chain Fv fragment ( scFv ; clone H6 ) was obtained from this affinity maturation process and has been further modified by site - directed mutagenesis . In order to crystallize the complex of scFv fragment and peptide , a truncated 12 amino acid long peptide was used , which is recognized by the scFv fragment . The truncated peptide binds to the scFv fragment in an α - helical conformation facing the scFv fragment with the side that binds the complementary peptide in the leucine zipper . This region of the peptide corresponds to the so - called trigger sequence , which has been found by Kammerer et al . 17 The trigger region has been shown to be essential for folding and coiled coil formation of the leucine zipper and contains a high α - helical content . 18 It is considered that the interaction of the two peptides upon coiled coil formation involves assembly of these α - helical stretches by conformational selection . The similarity of the peptide conformation in the coiled - coil pep - Fig . 1 . Influence of an externally applied force on the energy land - scape of a protein or a protein – protein complex . ( a ) Two - dimen - sional cross - section through the energy landscape without an exter - nally applied force ( black ) . In this picture the protein or the protein – protein complex ( blue ) is situated in one of the closely related subs - tates at minimal energy . The free energy difference Δ G between the folded protein or the bound protein - protein complex ( blue ) and the unbound or unfolded state is determined by the difference bet - ween the energy barrier Δ G off and the activation energy Δ G on . There - fore , the barrier between these two states ( Δ G off ) , which can be over - come due to thermal fluctuations , determines the rate of interconver - sion ( k off ) . k off is the basal dissocia - tion rate ; Δ x is the potential width . ( b ) Two - dimensional cross - section through the energy landscape with an externally applied force ( red ) . If an external force F is applied , the energy landscape is tilted ( red ) , thereby reducing the energy barrier by – Fx ( broken red line ) . This reduc - tion leads to an increase of the disso - ciation rate . 1254 Unbinding Pathways of an Antibody - Peptide Complex 63 tide and in the complex with the antibody fragment implies that the binding to the antibody fragment follows a similar mechanism with helix formation being the prerequisite for binding to the antibody fragment . For our studies , the peptide antigen provides the possibility to vary the attachment points of the pep - tide , since the amino acid for coupling can be introduced easily at different positions . This gives us the possibility to investigate whether the unbind - ing pathway of the regarded antibody fragment - peptide complex is changed by the direction of the applied force , which would point to the existence of a multidimensional energy landscape . High - resolution AFM - based single molecule force spectroscopy mea - surements were performed to determine the basal dissociation rate k off , which correlates with the height of the energy barrier , which has to be overcome for unbinding , and the potential width Δ x , which is a rough measure of the width of the binding potential . The results for k off were then compared with the k off values determined under equilibrium conditions with surface plasmon resonance ( SPR ) . Complementary , steered molecular dynamics ( SMD ) simulations were performed to provide additional information about the energy landscape of the res - pective antibody fragment - peptide system . Fur - thermore , SMD simulations allow the analysis of the chosen unbinding pathway with atomic resolu - tion . 19 – 22 SMD simulations enable the identification of the rupture events and the corresponding mole - cular interactions correlated with these ruptures . This structural information was related to the results obtained from the AFM measurements . Results and Discussion Single - molecule force spectroscopy The antibody fragment H6 used in our studies binds the truncated 12 amino acid long peptide antigen corresponding to amino acids 17 – 28 of the wildtype leucine zipper GCN4 - p1 . 15 , 23 Here , the numbering of the structure file ( PDB code 1P4B ) is used , which numbers the amino acids of the peptide from 1 to 12 . To explore the energy landscape of the antibody fragment – peptide complex in detail , force spectroscopy measurements were performed using an atomic force microscope ( AFM ) . For this purpose , the antibody fragment H6 was covalently coupled to a surface containing covalently attached poly ( ethy - lene glycol ) ( PEG ) and the peptide was immobilized on the cantilever tip in the same way ( Fig . 2 ) . The use of the elastic spacer PEG minimizes nonspecific interactions and maximizes the probability of de - tecting specific and single rupture events . Three configurations representing different attachment points were analyzed in detail : For configuration N , a cysteine followed by three glycine residues was attached to the N terminus ( Tyr - 1 peptide ; correspond - ing to amino acid 17 of the full - length leucine zipper ) in order to couple the peptide to the canti - lever of the AFM . For configuration M , the coupling Fig . 2 . Experimental setup . The antibody fragment H6 possessing a C - terminal cysteine was covalently immobilized onto an amino - functio - nalized glass slide using a hetero - bifunctional poly ( ethylene glycol ) spacer . The same coupling chemis - try was used for the immobilization of the peptide to the cantilever . N , M and C show different measurement configurations . In configuration N , a cysteine and three glycine residues were attached to the N terminus of the peptide . In configuration M , alanine on position 8 of the peptide sequence was changed to a cysteine . In configuration C , three glycine residues followed by a cysteine were attached to the C terminus of the peptide . 1255 Unbinding Pathways of an Antibody - Peptide Complex 64 to the cantilever was achieved via a cysteine resi - due , which replaced Ala - 8 peptide ( corresponding to amino acid 24 of the full - length leucine zipper ) in the “ middle ” of the peptide . It is obvious from the structure of the peptide that Ala - 8 peptide is not involved in interactions with the antibody fragment . However , this amino acid is in the region of the leucine zipper with the highest helix propensity and mutations in this region might impair helix forma - tion . 24 For configuration C , a spacer of three glycine residues followed by a cysteine was attached to the C terminus of the truncated peptide ( Lys - 12 peptide ; corresponding to amino acid 28 of the full - length leucine zipper ) . In the following , the three different attachment possibilities of the peptide are abbre - viated to N , M and C . In all experiments , the surface was approached with the tip of the cantilever , allowing the antibody fragment – peptide complex to bind . Subsequently , the cantilever was retracted and the antibody fragment – peptide complex was loaded with an increasing force until the complex ruptured and the cantilever relaxed back into its equilibrium position . The force applied to this complex was recorded as a function of the distance between the cantilever tip and the surface . Fig . 3a shows three different force - extension curves , which correspond to the rupture events of the different antibody fragment – peptide complexes N ( red ) , M ( green ) or C ( blue ) respectively . The force - extension curves measured for the three different configura - tions N , M and C exhibit similar rupture forces . To obtain good statistics , several hundreds of force - extension curves at different retract velocities were recorded using only one cantilever for every con - figuration . The use of one cantilever per configura - tion is crucial in these experiments to minimize errors originating from the cantilever calibration . The rupture force and the rupture length were determined from the force - extension curves . Force - time curves revealed the corresponding loading rate . Fig . 3b and c show the rupture force and loading rate distributions for configuration N , measured at a retract velocity of 800 nm / s . The rupture force histogram was fit with a Gaussian distribution ( black curve ) and has a most probable force of 47 . 3 pN . The Gaussian distribution of the loading rates ( plotted logarithmically ) ( Fig . 3c ) shows a maximum at a loading rate of 1307 . 8 pN s − 1 . The maxima of the force and the loading rate distributions were determined for a large range of loading rates ( from 40 pN s − 1 to 31 , 000 pN s − 1 ) for all three configurations , which were each measured with only one cantilever to reduce spring calibration errors within one measurement . In the following step these values were plotted in a force versus load - ing rate ( plotted logarithmically ) diagram ( Fig . 4 ) . Following the approach used by Evans and co - workers , 4 the basal dissociation rate k off and the potential width Δ x were determined from a linear fit to the data points in the force versus loading rate diagram ( Eq . ( 1 ) ) . The measurements of configura - tion N resulted in a k off of 16 . 9 ( ±1 . 0 ) ×10 − 3 s − 1 and a Δ x of 0 . 82±0 . 01 nm . The denoted errors refer to the constant estimated error of ±0 . 2 pN , which includes the injected noise and oscillations as described in Materials and Methods . In order to obtain the total error of the measurement , the systematic error for the calibration of the spring constant needs to be taken into account . The resulting maximum and Fig . 3 . Results from the AFM measurements . ( a ) Example of three typical force - extension curves measured for configurations N , M and C . The force - extension curves show the rupture event of the scFv – peptide complex , recorded at a retract velocity of 800 nm / s . The red force - extension curve corresponds to a rupture event measured for configuration N . The green and blue force - extension curves were gained for configurations M and C , respec - tively . All force - extension curves follow the characteristic shape of an extension curve of the poly ( ethylene glycol ) spacer and possess very similar rupture forces . The elastic behavior of the spacer can be described with the two - state FJC - fit ( black curve ) . ( b ) Example of a rupture force distribution , obtained for configuration N . The rupture force histogram contains ∼ 300 rupture events and was fitted with a Gaussian curve ( black ) . ( c ) Example of a loading rate distribution obtained for configuration N . The histogram of the loading rates was plotted logarith - mically and fit with a Gaussian curve ( black ) . 1256 Unbinding Pathways of an Antibody - Peptide Complex 65 minimum linear fit ( see Materials and Methods ) re - veals the following values for k off and Δ x : 14 . 5 ( ±1 . 0 ) × 10 − 3 s − 1 for k off , max and 0 . 79±0 . 01 nm for Δ x max and 14 . 8 ( ±1 . 0 ) ×10 − 3 s − 1 for k off , min and 0 . 87±0 . 01 nm for Δ x min . The obtained values for k off and Δ x , including their calculated errors , for all configurations N , M and C are given in Table 1 . This detailed error ana - lysis demonstrates that the basal dissociation rates and the potential widths of the three different con - figurations N , M and C can be clearly separated . A comparison of the three different configurations shows that configuration N possesses the smallest potential width and the fastest basal dissociation rate , which corresponds to the smallest energy barrier in the respective multidimensional energy landscape . In contrast , configuration C revealed the largest poten - tial width ( Δ x = 1 . 10 ± 0 . 01 nm ) and the slowest basal dissociation rate ( k off = 1 . 3 ( ±1 . 0 ) ×10 − 3 s − 1 ) , which therefore corresponds to the highest energy barrier of the three measured configurations . The values for the basal dissociation rate ( k off = 7 . 6 ( ±1 . 0 ) ×10 − 3 s − 1 ) and the potential width ( Δ x = 0 . 95±0 . 01 nm ) for con - figuration M are between the values obtained for configurations N and C . Interestingly , the configura - tion with the fastest basal dissociation rate has the smallest potential width ( configuration N ) , and the configuration with the slowest basal dissociation rate has the largest potential width ( configuration C ) . Hence , in our system the length that the complex can be stretched before it finally ruptures is correlated with the basal dissociation rate . This correlation has been observed before for the interaction of different anti - fluorescein scFv fragments with their antigen fluorescein . 25 For the experiments performed here , this correlation can originate from a different starting conformation of the bound complexes . In this case , the number and strength of the stabilizing interac - tions would determine the basal dissociation rate and the potential width . Alternatively , the direction of the applied force can result in different unbinding pathways on the multidimensional energy landscape . Comparison of the basal dissociation rates ( AFM ) with surface plasmon resonance ( SPR ) data In order to rule out the existence of different starting conformations , SPR measurements were done to investigate whether the attached cysteine residues ( at the N terminus , the C terminus and the Ala8Cys peptide mutation ) led to different con - formations of the complex and as a result to diffe - rences in the dissociation rates and potential widths . These measurements revealed a dissociation rate of 1 . 5 ( ±0 . 6 ) ×10 − 3 s − 1 for the peptide with the cys - teine at its N terminus and 0 . 9 ( ±0 . 2 ) ×10 − 3 s − 1 for the peptide with the cysteine at its C terminus . Fur - thermore , the following equilibrium binding con - stants were obtained : 13 . 4 ( ±8 . 7 ) ×10 − 9 M for con - figuration N and 9 . 2 ( ±5 . 0 ) ×10 − 9 M for configuration C . SPR measurements using the peptide with the Ala8Cys peptide mutation failed due to an insufficient signal . As indicated earlier , the mutation might reduce the helix propensity and therefore result in a lower fraction of α - helical peptides that are available for binding to the antibody fragment . On the basis of this assumption , the amount of helical peptides is considered to be too low to produce a signal in the SPR measurements . Therefore , no con - clusion can be drawn about the stability of the complex itself and configuration M is not discussed further . In contrast , the values for the peptides with the cysteine attached at the N or C terminus agree within the experimental error . Concluding from Fig . 4 . Diagram showing the most probable rupture force plotted against the corresponding loading rate ( logarithmically ) for all three configurations N , M and C . The data points were gained from the Gaussian fits of the rupture force histogram and the histogram of loading rates . The red data points ( configuration N ) were fit to a straight line . From this linear fit , Δ x = 0 . 82±0 . 01 nm and k off = 16 . 9 ( ±1 . 3 ) ×10 − 3 s − 1 were obtained . The green data set was measured for configuration M . From the linear fit , Δ x = 0 . 95±0 . 01 nm and k off = 7 . 6 ( ±1 . 0 ) ×10 − 3 s − 1 were obtained . Finally , the measurement of configuration C yielded the blue data set . Here , the linear fit led to Δ x = 1 . 10±0 . 01 nm and k off = 1 . 3 ( ±0 . 2 ) ×10 − 3 s − 1 . Table 1 .

However , from these experiments it cannot be excluded that the different attachment points lead to a disturbance of the system when performing the AFM measurements . The structure together with the SMD simulations ( see below ) show that one of the main interactions between the peptide and the scFv fragment is very close to the N - terminal attachment point . Hence , the faster dissociation rate observed for the AFM in comparison to the SPR results might be caused by a partial unfolding of the peptide close to the attachment point , so that the interaction is partially weakened due to the linker used in the AFM measurements . Although it cannot be ruled out that the immobilization on the AFM cantilever leads to slightly different conformations of the peptide , the data suggest that the different basal dissociation rates and potential widths are a consequence of the direction of the applied force . Assuming that the direction of the applied force results in different unbinding pathways , the values obtained for the basal dissociation rates and potential widths can be explained as follows . Within the experimental error , the basal dissociation rate for the peptide with the C - terminal cysteine determined with SPR agrees with the k off value obtained for configuration C with the AFM . This leads to the conclusion , that the same barrier in the energy landscape is probed . In contrast , configuration N revealed a 13 - fold higher basal dissociation rate , compared with the SPR value for the peptide with the N terminal cysteine . This difference for configuration N can be explained by considering an energy landscape with at least two barriers that need to be overcome ( Fig . 5a ) . If no external force is applied , as is the case in the SPR measurements , the unbinding of the antibody fragment – peptide complex always follows the pathway with the lowest energy barrier . In contrast , in the AFM measurements the externally applied force is considered to define the pathway . In addition , the applied force tilts the energy land - scape . The expected experimentally observed bar - rier heights and unbinding pathways are shown in the 2 - D projection in Fig . 5b . For the SPR measure - ments , the second higher energy barrier is rate limiting for the unbinding of the antibody frag - ment – peptide complex , since this barrier has to be overcome to generate the free antibody fragment and the peptide ( black curve in Fig . 5b ) . If an external force is applied , unbinding follows a different pathway and the energy landscape is tilted ( red curve in Fig . 5b ) such that the first originally lower energy barrier becomes prominent and is rate limiting . This simplified picture of the underlying energy landscape is able to explain the observed higher dissociation rate with the AFM for configuration N compared with the equilibrium measurement . Steered molecular dynamics ( SMD ) simulations SMD simulations were done in order to explore the energy landscape in the high - velocity regime and to obtain more structure - based information about the energy barriers . 8 , 19 – 22 , 26 The structure PDB code 1P4B 15 of the truncated 12 amino acid long peptide bound to the antibody fragment was used for all simulations . Corresponding to the AFM experiments , three different attachment points on the peptide were defined ( see Fig . 6 ) . A pulling po - tential was attached to the N terminus of the pep - tide ( configuration N ; Ala - 1 peptide ) , its C - terminus ( configuration C ; Lys - 12 peptide ) and Ala - 8 peptide Fig . 5 . Simplified model energy landscape explaining the AFM and SPR unbinding pathways of configuration N . ( a ) Three - dimensional representation of the energy land - scape . In the SPR measurements , the unbinding of the antibody fragment – peptide complex always follows the pathway with the lowest energy barrier . In contrast , in the AFM measurements the pathway is determined by the direction of the applied force . ( b ) Two - dimensional pro - jection of the unbinding pathway , including two energy barriers , in a defined direction . For the SPR measurements ( black curve ) , the second higher energy barrier is rate limiting for the unbinding of the antibody fragment – peptide complex . If an external force is applied , the energy landscape is tilted ( red curve ) . As a consequence , the first originally lower barrier becomes prominent and rate limiting for the unbinding process . Therefore , for config - uration N , the AFM and SPR measurements probe different barriers of the energy landscape . 1258 Unbinding Pathways of an Antibody - Peptide Complex 67 ( configuration M ) . In contrast to the AFM measure - ments , no additional amino acid was attached to the N or C terminus of the peptide and the alanine at position 8 was not replaced with a cysteine , which was necessary for the AFM - based analysis . The pulling potential steered the attached amino acid directly away from the antibody fragment at a speed of v pull = 2 nm / ns . The all - atom trajectories and the pulling forces for every time - step were recorded for every simulation . An average force - time curve out of 20 trajectories was generated for every configuration . A character - istic force - time curve with minimal root - mean - square deviation from the average force - time curve is shown in Figs 7 – 9 . At least 65 % of all 20 trajectories show the main pathway of the average force - time curve and were used for further analysis . For each con - figuration , the average times t i j and average forces F i j ( i = 1 , 2 , corresponding to the number of the force peak ; j = N , M , C ) were determined by analyzing the force peaks , which indicate the positions of the major rupture events in the unbindning pathways , and the errors were calculated as Gaussian errors . In configuration N , the peptide is zipped off the antibody fragment starting from its N terminus . Here , two main barriers have been identified ( Fig . 7 ; Table 2 ) . The first barrier is crossed after t 1N = 440± 25 ps with a mean force of F 1N = 567±25 pN and corresponds to the rupture of a hydrophobic contact between the amino acids Tyr - L40 and Leu - 3 peptide . For the first rupture event , a rupture length of r 1N = 0 . 88±0 . 05 nm was detected . The pathway that involves this interaction is taken in 75 % of all trajectories . The second rupture event occurs after t 2N = 860±28 ps with a mean force of F 2N = 716± 23 pN . For this second rupture event , the rupture length equaled r 2N = 1 . 72±0 . 06 nm . The force peak , which corresponds to the second main barrier crossing and appears in 65 % of all trajectories , results from the rupture of the H - bond between Glu O ε - 6 peptide and the backbone hydrogen Gly H - H40 . The last contact for the unbinding process is formed by Asn - L69 , Arg - L70 , Arg - 9 peptide and Leu - 10 peptide . In configuration M , the peptide is separated from the antibody fragment in a double zipper mode , which leads to breakage of two stabilizing inter - actions next to the steered amino acid ( Fig . 8 ) . Fig . 6 . Steered molecular dynamics simulations setup . All molecular dynamics simulations were started using the same initial structure . The center of mass ( COM ) of the heavy chain V H was fixed in space during the whole simulation time , whereas the light chain V L was not constricted . ( a ) For the simulation of the unbinding forces the pulling potential was attached to different C α atoms of the peptide to yield the configurations N , M and C . ( b – d ) Last contacts between the scFv fragment and the peptide revealed by the SMD simulations . The last contacts bet - ween the peptide and the antibody fragment are shown for the respective configurations . The amino acids are identi - fied in the main text . Fig . 7 . Unbinding process of configuration N . ( a ) Force - time curves . The mean average force - time curve ( black ) and a representative force - time graph ( red ) were plotted . The unbinding process shows two important events , which correspond to the highlighted force peaks . The colors of the highlighted force peaks were chosen according to the colors in the molecular structures ( cyan for the first rupture event and purple for the second rup - ture event ) . ( b ) Structural origin of the first unbinding event . The first unbinding event ( cyan ) corresponds to the rupture of the hydrophobic contact between Tyr - L40 and Leu - 3 peptide . The picture shows the molecular structure shortly before the event is observed . c . Structural origin of the second unbinding event . The second unbinding event ( purple ) corresponds to the rupture of the important H - bond between GLY H - H40 and GLU O ε - 6 peptide . The picture shows the molecular structure shortly before the event is observed . This second rupture event has also been found in the two other configurations M and C . 1259 Unbinding Pathways of an Antibody - Peptide Complex 68 Nevertheless , only one major force peak can be identified after an average pulling time of t 1M = 319± 9 ps ( corresponding to a rupture length of r 1M = 0 . 64±0 . 02 nm ) at an average force of F 1M = 1161± 28 pN ( Table 2 ) . The main barrier is identified clearly as the rupture of the H - bond between Gly H - H40 and Glu O ε - 6 peptide ( in 95 % of all trajectories ) . This interaction also causes the second rupture event in the majority of trajectories in configuration N ( Fig . 7 ; Table 2 ) . Subsequent to this H - bond rupture in configuration M , after a mean time of additional Δ t M = 40 ± 8 ps ( corresponding to Δ r M = 0 . 08 ± 0 . 02 nm ) , the double H - bond between Asp O δ i - H137 and Arg H ζ i - 9 peptide ( i = 1 , 2 ) ruptures ( Fig . 8 ) without a resolvable additional force peak . The last contact for the unbinding process in configuration M is formed via Asn - L68 , Asn - L69 and Lys - 11 peptide on the C - terminal side . The last contact on the N - terminal side of the peptide ruptures shortly before the C - terminal last contact between Leu - 3 peptide and His - 2 peptide of the peptide and Asn - L68 , Asp - H33 and Leu - H110 of the scFv fragment . In configuration C , the peptide is zipped off starting from its C terminus end . Again , two main force peaks are identified . The first force peak was detected after t 1C = 514±20 ps ( corresponding to a rupture length of r 1C = 1 . 03±0 . 04 nm ) at a mean force of F 1C = 775±28 pN . This force peak coincides with the opening of the stabilizing backbone H - bond of the first peptide helix loop between Val - 7 peptide and Leu - 10 peptide . Hence , the first major rupture event refers to the opening of the secondary structure of the peptide and not to the breakage of a peptide – antibody fragment bond . The rupture of this interaction on the main unbinding pathway is seen in 85 % of all trajectories . The second barrier crossing occurred after an average time of t 2C = 750±45 ps with an average rupture length of r 2C = 1 . 50±0 . 09 nm and an average force of F 2C = 720±21 pN . This force peak is again determined by the rupture of the H - bond between Gly H - H40 and Glu O ε - 6 peptide ( Fig . 9 ; Table 2 ) . A total of 65 % of all trajectories crossed this second barrier via the main unbinding pathway . The last contact for the unbinding process of configura - tion C is formed via His - 2 peptide , LEU - 3 peptide , Thr - L32 , Thr - L67 , Asn - L68 and Asn - L69 . The three configurations underline the importance of the H - bond between the backbone of Gly H - H40 and Glu O ε - 6 peptide . The breakage of this bond is a Fig . 8 .

This rupture event has also been found in configurations N and M . 1260 Unbinding Pathways of an Antibody - Peptide Complex 69 dominant rupture event in the majority of all trajec - tories independent of the pulling vector . The con - figurations N and C , where the peptide unbinds in a single zipper mode , show two main rupture events . In configuration N , the first force peaks occurs earlier ( t 1N b t 1C ) and at lower forces ( F 1N b F 1C ) with respect to configuration C . The respective first force peak in configurations N and C results from different molecular interactions . Therefore , different force vectors probe different pathways through the land - scape . However , the second force peak corresponds to the same molecular interaction of Gly H - H40 and Glu O ε - 6 peptide in both configurations . The rupture forces of this interaction , indicative of the slope of the energy surface , are comparable in both configura - tions . And yet , in configuration C , the second force peak occurs earlier ( t 2N N t 2C ) . The rupture length for this second force peak of configuration C ( r 2C = 1 . 50± 0 . 09 nm ) is hence shorter than in configuration N ( r 2N = 1 . 72±0 . 06 nm ) , despite probing the identical interaction . This is due to the different intramole - cular distances between force attachment points and the Glu O ε - 6 peptide , demonstrating that , depend - ing on the configuration , the same barrier can have different characteristics ( here , the barrier width ) . Fur - thermore , this interaction between Gly H - H40 with Glu O ε - 6 peptide is also probed in configuration M , showing a very different fingerprint of the force curve than in the other two configurations . The shorter rupture length and higher rupture forces compared with configurations N and C result from the very direct force attachment point , again underlining the fact that the molecular nature of the interaction and the geometry of the force probing crucially determine the characteristics of the probed interaction . Comparison of the SMD and AFM results Both simulation and experiment probe the respec - tive antibody fragment – peptide complex at the same positions on the peptide , thereby exerting forces in the same directions . SMD simulations , due to computational limitations , probe the system at much higher loading rates . 22 , 27 Hence , thermal relaxation occurs only partially . The system lacks the time to relax orthogonally to the pulling direc - tion and resulting from this , lacks the time to explore the energy landscape locally to find the optimal pathway to cross the barrier . 27 This might lead to a steeper pathway on the energy landscape potentially crossing higher barriers and finally resulting in higher rupture forces . Whereas higher rupture forces have been observed for all configurations , this effect is most dominant for configuration M , which unbinds in a double zipper mode ( nearly simulta - neous rupture of two bonds ) . In the simulations , as soon as the first important interaction breaks ( H - bond Gly H - H40 , which binds Glu O ε - 6 peptide ) , the more stable double H - bond of the interaction bet - ween Asp O δ i - H137 and Arg H ζ i - 9 peptide ( i = 1 , 2 ) experiences the full load and ruptures within 40 ps ( Fig . 8 ) . In contrast , in the AFM experiments , the system can relax orthogonally to the applied force and can re - arrange after the first breakage . As a re - sult , after the first breakage the complex might become so unstable that dissociation occurs on a timescale too fast to be observed with the AFM . Furthermore , the Ala8Cys mutation in the peptide used in the AFM experiments may lead to additional disturbances of the peptide structure , which may result in a lower stability of the complex . The muta - tion lies in that region of the peptide with the highest probability for α - helix formation and mutations at this position have been shown to have an influence on the stability of the leucine zipper . 24 , 28 Although , as described previously , this mutation is considered to influence the binding process more than the stability of the bound complex , a destabilizing con - tribution of the mutation on the complex cannot be fully excluded . A more detailed comparison of the values ob - tained from the AFM experiments and the SMD simulations provides an explanation of the energy barriers on the unbinding pathways for the res - pective configurations . The comparison of the po - tential widths obtained with the AFM and the rup - ture lengths obtained from the SMD simulations shows that the rupture lengths for configurations N and C for the first barrier crossing of the main unbinding pathway ( r 1N , r 1C ) are in good agreement with the potential widths obtained with the AFM ( Δ x N , Δ x C ) ( Tables 1 and 2 ) . Hence , the AFM expe - riments probe the first barrier observed in the SMD simulations ( Fig . 10 ) . Again , for configuration M , the observed differences might result from the different relaxation due to different time regimes and from the potentially destabilizing mutation , as discussed above . Furthermore , the SMD simulations provide further evidence for the existence of a second energy barrier , Table 2 .

The forces needed to overcome the second barrier of the main unfolding pathway are of the same order of magnitude as for the first barrier crossing . Yet , the second rupture event for config - urations N and C occurs at nearly twice the distance of the first rupture event ( Table 2 ) . Hence , the second energy barrier of the main unfolding pathway in the energy landscape has a large potential width . Outer barriers are much more influenced by externally applied forces than inner barriers , due to the tilted energy landscape . Because of this large potential width of the second barrier observed in the SMD simulations , it is plausible that this barrier is not probed in the AFM measurements , even at the lowest applied loading rates . Therefore , the existence of two energy barriers is not in conflict with the observation that the AFM data could be fit with a straight line in the force versus loading rate plot in Fig . 4 . The SMD data explain the observed potential widths in the different experimental configurations , and they provide more information about the basal dissociation rates of the first barrier crossing ob - tained from the AFM measurements . As stated earlier , the results from the SMD simulations show that the first barrier crossing in configuration C occurs at a longer rupture length ( r 1C N r 1N ) and at a greater force ( F 1C N F 1N ) than in configuration N . Since the forces measured with the SMD simula - tions correspond to the slope of the energy barrier in the energy landscape , the higher forces observed in configuration C result from a steeper energy barrier . This steeper energy barrier together with the longer rupture length indicates that the first energy barrier of the main unbinding pathway is higher in configuration C than in configuration N . A higher energy barrier corresponds to a lower dissociation rate . Hence , if — as already concluded from the comparison of AFM and SPR — the inner energy barrier is rate - determining for the AFM experiments ( Fig . 5 ) , experiment and simulation agree on a lower dissociation rate for configuration C compared with the dissociation rate for config - uration N ( k off , 1 ( C ) b k off , 1 ( N ) ) . Conclusions Awell - characterized antibody – antigen interaction has been chosen to explore the underlying energy landscape with a combination of different techni - ques . The main focus was to investigate if different pulling directions lead to different unbinding path - ways and therefore provide a more detailed insight into the unbinding process of the interaction . SMD simulations detected two rupture events for every pulling direction . One rupture event in each config - uration is determined by the same molecular bond , whereas the other rupture event originates from the breakage of different bonds . These findings show clearly that the underlying energy landscape is multidimensional . This information could not be obtained from the AFM measurements alone , which show a linear dependence of the rupture forces on the logarithm of the loading rate — a feature that is characteristic for a two - state system with only one barrier . However , a comparison of AFM and SPR points to the existence of at least one more barrier . SPR always probes the lowest energy barrier in the energy landscape . When performing AFM measure - ments , the complex might be forced to follow a steeper unbinding pathway , which would result in a lower dissociation rate ( corresponding to a higher barrier ) . But , as stated earlier , the basal dissociation rate for configuration N obtained with the AFM is higher than the k off value obtained with SPR . This leads to the conclusion that the energy barrier probed with the AFM is lower than the energy barrier that has to be overcome under equilibrium conditions . Therefore , an additional energy barrier has to exist along the pulling direction of configura - tion N ( Fig . 5 ) , which is not detectable with the Fig . 10 . Two - dimensional projection of the energy barriers obtained from the AFM experiments and the rupture lengths obtained from the SMD simulations . To summarize the results , the potential widths and basal dissociation rates have been taken from the AFM mea - surements and plotted in a 2 - D energy diagram ( config - uration N , red ; configuration M , green ; and configuration C , blue ) to provide an overview of the barriers that need to be crossed . Further unbinding pathways on the respective energy landscapes are not known . The arrows above the energy landscapes indicate the positions of the respective rupture lengths for the first and second barrier crossing of the main unbinding pathway , obtained from the SMD simulations . 1262 Unbinding Pathways of an Antibody - Peptide Complex 71 AFM . The results from the SMD simulations further support this conclusion , since the outer ( second ) barrier has a very large potential width so that the inner ( first ) barrier is most likely rate - determining even at the smallest loading rates . For configuration C , the SMD simulations also show a second barrier , which is considered to be lower than the first barrier and which is therefore not probed experimentally . In conclusion , the experimental set - up chosen for the AFM measurements , which allows the site - specific immobilization of the binding partners , shows clearly that the direction of the applied force defines the unbinding pathway on a multidimen - sional energy landscape . This finding points out clearly that non ( site ) - specific coupling procedures provide a simplified picture of the molecular inter - actions as the contributions of different unbinding pathways are averaged out . Materials and Methods Preparation of the peptides and the scFv fragment Peptides representing a truncated version of the GCN4 - p1 leucine zipper Y 1 HLENEVA 8 RLKK 12 were obtained from Jerini Peptide Technologies GmbH , Berlin , Germany . A cysteine has been introduced at different positions during solid - phase synthesis to provide site - specific attachment points for the immobilization on the cantilever ( Fig . 2 ) : NH 2 - CGGGYHLENEVARLKK - amide ( configuration N ) , NH 2 - YHLENEVCRLKK - amide ( configurationM ) , andNH 2 - YHLENEVARLKKGGGC - amide ( configuration C ) . The expression and purification of the scFv fragment H6 was carried out as described . 29 Briefly , the scFv fragment H6 was expressed with a C - terminal His tag followed by cysteine to allow a site - specific immobilization . The plasmid for the periplasmic expression in Escherichia coli is based on the pAK series . 30 The gene for co - expression of the periplasmic chaperone Skp was introduced . 31 The original His tag was replaced by a His 6 tag followed by two glycine residues and a cysteine . For the expression and purification of H6 , the protocol described by Hanes et al . 16 was slightly modified . In short , the bacteria with the transformed plasmid were grown at 25 °C in SB medium ( 20 g l − 1 Tryptone , 10 g l − 1 yeast extract , 5 g l − 1 NaCl , 50 mM K 2 HPO 4 ) containing 30 μ g ml − 1 chloramphenicol . Expression was induced with 1 mM isopropyl - β - d - thiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG ) at an A 600 between 1 . 0 and 1 . 5 . The cells were harvested 3 h after induction by centri - fugation . Cell disruption was achieved by French press lysis . The scFv fragment H6 was purified using two chromatography steps . After chromatography on a Ni 2 + - NTA column ( Qiagen , Hilden , Germany ) using standard protocols the eluted fraction was loaded directly onto an affinity column with immobilized antigen . The fractions from the affinity column were dialyzed against coupling buffer ( 50 mM sodium phosphate , pH 7 . 2 , 50 mM NaCl , 10 mM EDTA ) and concentrated using Centricon YM - 10 ( Millipore , Eschborn , Germany ) . The actual concentration of the purified scFv fragment H6 was determined by measuring A 280 . The extinction coefficient was calculated using the program Vector NTI ( Invitrogen , Karlsruhe , Germany ) . The preparation of the purified protein was adjusted to a concentration of 0 . 8 mg ml − 1 and stored at − 80 °C . Preparation of slides and cantilevers for the AFM measurements Poly ( ethylene glycol ) ( PEG ) was used as a spacer bet - ween the biomolecules and the surfaces . PEG is an ideal spacer for force spectroscopy measurements 25 , 32 – 37 , as it provides protein - resistant surfaces , 38 thereby reducing the number of non - specific binding events . In addition , PEG shows a characteristic force - extension curve , allow - ing the discrimination between specific and non - specific interactions during data analysis . The scFv fragment H6 possessing a C terminal cysteine was immobilized on an amino - functionalized slide using a hetero - bifunctional NHS - PEG - maleimide ( mass = 5000 g / mol ; Nektar , Huntsville , AL , USA ) . The three peptides were separately immobilized via their introduced cysteine to an amino - functionalized cantilever , again using the NHS - PEG - maleimide spacer ( Fig . 2 ) . In detail , the cantilevers ( Bio - lever , Olympus , Tokyo , Japan ) were activated with a 10 min UV - ozone cleaning treatment and amino modified with 3 - aminopropyl - dimethylethoxysilane ( ABCR GmbH , Karlsruhe , Ger - many ) as described . 29 , 35 , 36 Commercially available amino - functionalized slides ( Slide A , Nexterion , Mainz , Germany ) were used for the immobilization of the scFv fragment . For the next steps , both surfaces ( slide and cantilever ) were treated in parallel as described . 39 Briefly , they were incubated in 50 mM sodium borate buffer , pH 8 . 5 , in order to increase the fraction of unprotonated amino groups for coupling to the NHS groups of the PEG . NHS - PEG - maleimide was dissolved at a concentration of 50 mM in borate buffer and incubated on the surfaces for 1 h . In parallel , one of the peptides and the scFv fragment H6 were reduced using TCEP beads ( Perbio Science , Bonn , Germany ) in order to generate free thiols . After washing both surfaces with ultrapure water , a solution of the peptide ( 200 μ M ) was incubated on the cantilever and a solution of the scFv fragment H6 ( 0 . 13 mg / ml ) was incubated on the slide for 1 h . Finally , both surfaces were rinsed with PBS ( 10 mM sodium phosphate , pH 7 . 4 , 137 mM NaCl , 2 . 7 mM KCl ) to remove non - covalently bound material , and stored in PBS at room temperature . Force spectroscopy All force measurements were performed with a MFP - 1D AFM ( Asylum Research , Santa Barbara , CA , USA ) at room temperature in PBS . The cantilever spring constants were 8 . 7 pN / nm for the measurement of configuration N ( see Fig . 2 ) , 3 . 4 pN / nm for the measurement of configuration M , and 4 . 2 pN / nm for the measurement of configuration C ( B - Bio - Lever ) and were obtained as described . 40 , 41 During the experiments , the approach and retract velocity were held constant , whereas the applied force was adjusted by changing the distance between the cantilever tip and the surface to obtain single binding events . Several hundred approach – retract cycles were carried out to achieve good statistics . Each experiment was done for different retract velocities ranging from 50 nm / s to 10 μ m / s to obtain measurements over a broad range of loading rates . Data extraction The experimental data were converted into force - extension curves . From these , the rupture force ( the force at which the antibody fragment – antigen complex rup - tures ) , the rupture length and the loading rate were 1263 Unbinding Pathways of an Antibody - Peptide Complex 72 determined using the program Igor Pro 5 . 0 ( Wavemetrics , Lake Oswego , OR , USA ) and a custom - written set of procedures . The rupture force was determined as described . 4 , 42 The loading rate was determined using the two - state , freely jointed chain fit to the force - extension curve , according to previous studies . 43 Data analysis To analyze the data set obtained from one experiment , which was recorded at a constant retract velocity , the rup - ture forces , the rupture lengths and the loading rates were plotted in three histograms . These histograms were ana - lyzed with a method based on the so - called Bell - Evans model . 4 , 44 The rupture force and loading rate ( plotted logarithmically ) histograms for each data set , i . e . for each retract velocity , were fitted with a Gaussian distribution to determine the maxima . Finally , these obtained maxima were plotted in a force versus loading rate diagram . The max - imum force ( from the Gaussian distribution of the rupture force histogram ) represents the most probable force F * : F * ¼ k B d T D x ln F d D x k B d T d k off ð 1 Þ where k B is the Boltzmann constant , T is temperature , Δ x is the potential width , k off is the basal dissociation rate at zero force and F * ( = d F / d t ) is the loading rate . From a linear fit of the force versus loading rate ( pictured logarithmically ) plot and Eq . ( 1 ) , Δ x and k off of the antibody fragment – antigen complex can be determined from the slope and the intercept of the linear fit with the abscissa . Error estimation To calculate the error of the dissociation rate k off and the potential width Δ x , the following assumptions were made : ( i ) The error in the calibration of the spring constant constitutes 10 % . ( ii ) Injected noise and oscillations lead to an error of ±0 . 2 pN in the measured rupture force . This value was estimated from the integration of the frequency spectrum of the cantilever in PBS to a frequency of 10 Hz . As described above , k off and Δ x can be calculated from the linear fit to the data points in the force versus loading rate diagram . Due to the use of only one cantilever for all data points , the error , originating from the calibration of the spring constant , leads to systematic higher or lower rupture forces and loading rates , and therefore to higher or lower most probable rupture forces and loading rates . We therefore determined the maximum and minimum linear fit . From these two fits , the maximum and minimum k off and Δ x can be calculated . In addition , the estimated value of ±0 . 2 pN was taken into account . This error is not systematic and can be added or subtracted from the most probable rupture force . By using a random generator , a mean linear fit was calculated . From this , we gained a mean value for k off and Δ x with the corresponding standard deviation . This procedure was applied to the original , the maximum and the minimum linear fit in the force versus loading rate plot to receive the maximum and minimum k off and Δ x with their corresponding standard deviations . Proof of specificity To prove the specificity of the force spectroscopy mea - surements , experiments were performed , either without the antibody fragment or without the peptide . By mea - suring the antibody fragment H6 , attached to the surface , against a cantilever tip passivated with PEG , more than 1000 force - extension curves were recorded . Thereby , less than 1 % non - specific interactions were detected . The measurements without the peptide led to similar results . SPR measurements The measurements of the dissociation rate k off ( 25 °C ) and the equilibrium constants K d of the scFv fragment H6 and the peptide with cysteine at either its N or C terminus were done with a Biacore X instrument ( BIAcore , Freiburg , Germany ) . For this purpose a CM5 sensor chip ( BIAcore ) was modified via amine coupling according to the manufacturer ' s protocol . Clone H6 was diluted in immo - bilization buffer ( 10 mM sodium acetate , pH 5 . 0 ) to a final concentration of 11 . 4 ng / μ l and placed onto the chip . The final signal intensity on the surface was ∼ 200 RU . A series of the respective peptide solutions in PBS buffer in the range of 1 . 64 – 400 nM for the measurement of k off and 4 – 400 nM for the measurement of K d was placed onto the chip . After binding , dissociation was followed at a flow rate of 50 μ l / min . The dissociation and association phase was fit globally , using the single - exponential fit function of the program BIAEvaluation 3 . 2 . The equilibrium constants were gained from separate determination of the dissocia - tion and association rate . Molecular dynamics simulations ( MD ) All MD simulations were based on the 2 . 35 Å resolution X - ray structure 1P4B 15 of the antibody scFv fragment bound to the peptide A 1 HLENEVA 8 RLKK 12 . Here , the amino acids of the antibody fragment are labeled with the three - letter code of the amino acid , the location in the V H or V L domain , and the position in the 1P4B PDB structure . The amino acids of the peptide are labeled as a combination of the three - letter code and the number of the amino acid in the crystal structure . To distinguish between antibody fragment and peptide amino acids , the residues of the peptide are identified by the subscript peptide . The first amino acid of the 1P4B PDB structure differs from the experimentally used amino acid . We chose not to mutate the sequence to match the experimental one , because this would have reduced the resolution of the structure . The influence of this sequential difference will not be significant , since it is located at the non - interacting end of the peptide . All MD simulations were performed using the software GROMACS . 45 – 47 We used periodic boundary conditions , the OPLS - AA force field 48 and SPC / E water 49 for all MD simulations . For all simulations first one energy - mini - mized , equilibrated and pre - oriented state of the proteins solved in water was generated . This initial structure was assigned to new Boltzmann - distributed velocities and again equilibrated shortly before the SMD simulations were performed . System preparation The antibody fragment – peptide structure 1P4B was pre - oriented with the helical peptide axis parallel with the z - 1264 Unbinding Pathways of an Antibody - Peptide Complex 73 axis of the system . Then the molecules were solvated in a 6 . 8 nm×6 nm×11 . 6 nm waterbox ( 16 , 034 H 2 O ) ionized with 45 sodium and 43 chloride atoms . The overall charge of the system was neutral . Steepest descent energy minimization was performed with a maximum step size of 0 . 01 nm up to a precision of 2000 kJ / ( mol·nm ) . No pressure or temperature coupling was used . The cut - off radius for Coulomb and van der Waals interactions was set to 1 nm . Afterwards , a water relaxation simulation of 200 ps was preformed . On all protein atoms , a positional restraint was placed using a harmonic potential with a force constant of 2000 kJ / ( mol·nm 2 ) = 3 . 32 nN / nm on the protein atoms . The LINCS algorithm was used on all bond constraints . 50 Protein and non - protein atoms were coupled separately to a heat - bath of 300 K using a time constant of 0 . 1 ps . All further simulations were performed using fast particle - mesh Ewald electrostatics with an order of 4 and a van der Waals cut - off of 1 . 0 nm . A 1 ns equilibration of the whole system followed . A leapfrog algorithm with a time - step of 2 fs was used . All C α atoms were restrained with a harmonic potential of 1000 kJ / ( mol·nm ) = 1 . 8 nN / nm to avoid an unwanted rotation of the system . The restraint potential was weak enough to allow small conformational changes of the backbone due to the equilibration . The side chains were not restricted and therefore freely equilibrating . The RMSD ( nm ) fit of the C α position reached a stable plateau within this equilibration ( data not shown ) . The temperature was restricted to 300 K analogs to the last step . The resulting structure was used as the initial structure for all configurations to allow a better comparison of the results . Before the actual SMD simulations were performed , for each simulation new random Boltzmann distributed velocities were assigned and an additional 200 ps pre - equilibration was performed . Simulations In every SMD simulation the antibody fragment was fixed in space via a COM movement removal of the chain V H of the antibody fragment . In each configuration , a different C α atom was steered away from the antibody fragment ( in the x - direction ) with a harmonic potential using a spring constant of k = 1600 kJ / ( mol·nm 2 ) = 2 . 66 nN / nm . This steering was executed for 3 ns at a speed of v pull = 2 nm / ns resulting in a final separation of 6 nm . The strong steering potential forces the attached atom to follow it closely . No other atom of the peptide is restricted in any way , leaving it to respond freely to the forced movement of the attached atom . Three different configurations were tested in correspon - dence to the AFM experiments . In configuration N , the C α atom of the N - terminal alanine Ala - 1 peptide of the antigen peptide was attached to the steering potential . In config - uration C , the C α atom of the C - terminal amino acid Lys - 12 peptide was attached and in the configuration M the C α atom of the eighth amino acid Ala - 8 peptide was attached . In contrast to the AFM experiments , no mutation in config - uration M was performed , because no cysteine for external linkage was needed in the SMD simulations . Acknowledgements We thank Dr .

Here , we analyze the inﬂuence of the velocity and geometry of the probing forces on a protein complex using this tool . With steered molecular dynamics , we probe the stability of the protein - protein complex Barnase - Barstar . The individual proteins are mechanically labile . The Barnase - Barstar binding site is more stable than the folds of the individual proteins . By using different force protocols , we observe a variety of responses of the system to the applied tension . INTRODUCTION Forces are regulating factors on protein complexes . Applica - tion of forces is important in numerous processes in biolog - ical systems like cell adhesion or cellular mobility ( 1 – 5 ) . In addition , forces are often used as an experimental tool for studying the energy landscapes of both individual proteins and protein - protein complexes ( 6 – 8 ) . The interpretation of these experiments is complex and a thorough description of the inﬂuence of different force protocols on the unbinding pathways is critical ( 9 ) . In particular , force - induced unfold - ing follows pathways that are different from spontaneous free - solution , chemically - induced , or temperature - induced types of unfolding ( 10 , 11 ) . Technically , the application of forces on the nanoscale can be realized using different experimental techniques like atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) , force pipette , optical twee - zers , or simulation methods like steered molecular dynamics ( SMD ) on the single - molecule level ( 12 – 22 ) . The response of secondary structure elements on different orientations of external stresses leads to a large range of un - raveling forces ( 23 – 25 ) . In more recent studies , the depen - dence of the mechanical stability of protein unfolding on the force linkage is demonstrated . On the model system of ubiquitin , it is shown , by experiment and simulation , that different ubiquitin linkages in nature differ in their unfolding forces and unfolding free energy proﬁles ( 26 – 28 ) . The un - folding of ﬁbronectin depends critically on the vector of the applied forces ( 29 ) . The force response and energy land - scape of the ﬂuorescence molecule GFP on different force attachment points has been examined using AFM experi - ments as well as model simulations ( 28 , 30 , 31 ) . An asym - metric nature of the force response of the titin kinase in a symmetrical setup was shown by Gra¨ter et al . , demon - strating the direction dependency of the protein response to force ( 32 ) , recently supported by AFM measurements ( 33 ) . In force - clamp simulations , possible relations between forced and chemically induced unfolding pathways have been suggested ( 34 ) . These studies underline the importance of both the history of force application as well as the direc - tion of the force vector for the observed response . Applied forces have also been used to estimate binding energies and to analyze protein - protein complexes . Recently , SMD simulations were used to force the cytochrome c 2 unbinding from the reaction center ( 35 ) , to unbind an anti - body - antigen complex ( 36 ) as well as to analyze the protein - protein interaction energies of the TCR - pMHC complex ( 37 ) . A general advantage of SMD simulations over the exper - imental techniques is that the chosen unfolding pathway can be analyzed in atomistic detail . However , due to computa - tional limitations , the used velocities exceed the experi - mental ones by orders of magnitude . This renders a direct comparison between experiment and simulation compli - cated . Thus , insight into the atomistic response to different force protocols used is crucial for this comparison . Further - more , it reveals details of the underlying energy landscape not observable without the explicit control over the experi - mental parameters offered by the simulation . In this work , we perform SMD simulations on the protein - protein complex Barnase - Barstar . We use different attach - ment points and different velocities of the force application to observe the response of the model system . This allows us to gain detailed insight into the effect of differently applied forces on a protein complex analogous to the depen - dence of mechanical stability of protein unfolding on the force linkage . Barnase is a bacterial RNase , which is excreted by the bacterium Bacillus amyloliquefaciens and is deadly to unpro - tected cells ( 38 – 42 ) . The natural inhibitor Barstar protects the bacterium . Due to the high evolutional pressure , the Barnase - Barstar complex is one of the fastest forming and most stable complexes known ( 43 ) . The fast association of the Barnase - Barstar is electrostati - cally facilitated ( 44 – 46 ) . Poisson - Boltzmann calculations predicted a stabilizing electrostatic effect in agreement with Submitted May 16 , 2008 , and accepted for publication January 13 , 2009 . * Correspondence : kay . gottschalk @ physik . uni - muenchen . de Editor : Helmut Grubmu¨ller . (cid:2) 2009 by the Biophysical Society 0006 - 3495 / 09 / 09 / 1687 / 13 $ 2 . 00 doi : 10 . 1016 / j . bpj . 2009 . 01 . 052 Biophysical Journal Volume 97 September 2009 1687 – 1699 1687 77 experimental data ( 47 ) . Brownian dynamics studies of the Barnase - Barstar complex showed that its association is diffu - sion - limited and the experimentally measured association rates can be reproduced ( 39 , 44 , 48 , 49 ) . Recently , the free energy landscape of this association has been analyzed . An optimal association pathway was found involving a region close to the RNA binding loop of the protein complex ( 50 , 51 ) . An overlap of association and dissociation path - ways , using rigid - body Brownian dynamics simulations with an implicit solvent model , has been suggested ( 51 ) . Although the equilibrium association of the Barnase - Barstar complex has been studied to a great extent , the response of the complex to nonequilibrium conditions has not been examined as thoroughly . However , during export of the complex , it is exposed to forces . Furthermore , protein complexes are in general an attractive target for force studies : the probing of protein - protein complexes by force can be regarded as a complex differential assay , where the mechan - ical stability of the individual folds is compared to the stability of the noncovalent binding site , depending on a variety of experimental parameters . The aim of this study is to investigate the mechanical stability of this model complex under the inﬂuence of different force applications . Since Barnase needs to be exported from the cell , we expect a low mechanical stability of the individual protein . However , since the cell needs to be protected as long as Barnase is not exported , we expect a high stability of the Barnase - Barstar binding site inhibiting RNA binding . Indeed , we demonstrate here that the complex binding site is more stable than the individual domains . We recapture basic features of the unbinding transition state . We show that we can alter the main trajectory from unfolding to several unbinding pathways by altering the attachment points of the steering forces . Hence , our simulations probe , in a differential force assay , the relative stability of regions within the complex , depending on the force protocol used . METHODS All simulations on the Barnase - Barstar complex ( PDB code : 1BRS ( 52 ) ) were performed with the MD simulation software GROMACS Ver . 3 . 2 – 3 . 3 . 3 ( 53 , 54 ) . Periodic boundary conditions , SPC / E ( 55 ) water , and OPLS - AA ( 56 ) force ﬁeld were used for all simulations . System preparation The Barnase - Barstar structure was preoriented in a 4 nm (cid:2) 5 . 8 nm (cid:2) 12 nm waterbox . The vector connecting C a bn 7 and C a bs 86 was oriented parallel to the z axis of the box . Thirteen Na þ and nine Cl (cid:3) atoms were added to neutralize the overall charge of the system at a 75 mM NaCl concentration . Energy minimization was performed with steepest descent and with a maximum step size of 0 . 01 nm . A cutoff radius of 1 nm for Coulomb and van der Waals interactions was used . A 200 - ps positional restraint simulation followed . All protein atoms were restrained by a harmonic potential with a harmonic force constant of 2000 kJ mol , nm 2 ¼ 3 : 32 nNnm . All bonds were constrained via the LINCS algorithm ( 57 ) . The COM translation of the system was removed . Berendsen temper - ature coupling ( 58 ) was used to couple the protein atoms and the nonprotein atoms separately in two groups with a temperature bath of 300 K and a time - constant of 0 . 1 ps . For all further simulations , electrostatics were calculated with fast particle - mesh Ewald electrostatics ( 59 ) with an order of four and a cutoff for Coulomb and van der Waals interactions of 1 . 0 nm . Five - hundred picoseconds of equilibration were performed using the leap - frog algorithm with a timestep of 2 fs . All C a backbone - atoms were restrained with a harmonic potential with a force constant of 200 kJ mol , nm to avoid a rotation of the system . For equilibration and all SMD runs , the protein complex and the solvent molecules were coupled to two separate Berendsen thermostats , setting each temperature to 300 K . In addition , Berendsen pressure coupling ( 58 ) set the whole system to 1 bar with a compressibility of 4 . 5 (cid:2) 10 (cid:3) 5 bar (cid:3) 1 and a time - constant of 0 . 5 ps . The ﬁnal structure of this equilibration step was used as the initial structure for all SMD simulations . Before an SMD was started , velocities were again randomly assigned and another 200 - ps equilibration were performed . SMD simulation For all setups , constant velocity pulling simulations with fast ( y fast ¼ 2 nmns ) , medium ( y medium ¼ 0 : 5 nmns ) , and slow ( y slow ¼ 0 : 125 nmns ) pulling velocities was done . The COM movement was removed for the atom / group where the complex was ﬁxed in space . A harmonic potential with a spring constant of k ¼ 1600 kJ mol , nm 2 ¼ 2 : 66 nN nm was moved in z direction until the ﬁnal position was at least 3 . 5 nm ( up to 6 nm ) away from the initial position . The majority was pulled 5 nm , which results in a pulling time of 2 . 5 ns for fast , 10 ns for medium , and 40 ns for slow pulling trajectories . The hard spring constantly forces the atom to closely follow the harmonic potential spatially and in time . Because the spring constant was kept constant , its inﬂuence on the loadingrate of theAFM did notvary inSetups1 – 3 . The numberof simulated trajectories per setup and pulling velocity can be found in Table 1 . Setup 1 The harmonic potential mimicking an AFM tip was attached to the C a atom of the ﬁrst residue of the ﬁrst element with regular secondary structure of Barnase ( C a bs 86 ) and ﬁxed the position of the C a atom of the last residue of the last element with regular secondary structure of Barstar ( C a bn 7 ) in Setup 1 . For the mirrored setup , Setup 1 m , the attachment points for pulling and spatial ﬁxation were exchanged ( Fig . 1 B ) . Setup 2 The COM of Barstar was pulled by the time - dependent harmonic potential , whereas the COM of Barnase was ﬁxed . Setup 3 For the direct probing of the protein - protein binding site , the COM of the C a values of the Barstar binding helix was the attachment point of the force . The COM of Barnase was ﬁxed like in Setup 2 . Only fast pulling was simu - lated . Due to the early unbinding of the protein complex , the pulling was only simulated for 2 . 25 ns , corresponding to a pulling length of 4 . 5 nm . Calculation of effective force and work First , the time of separation for each single trajectory in Setups 2 and 3 was determined . The forces exerted on the system after the separation were assumed to be the drag forces of the molecule through the solvent water . These drag forces were averaged for each trajectory individually from the time of the separation to the end of the simulation . To renormalize the forces after the separation to zero , we subtracted the average drag forces from the calculated forces . This resulted in an effective force F eff for the separation : F eff ð x Þ ¼ F ð x Þ (cid:3) (cid:2) F drag (cid:3) : ( 1 ) Biophysical Journal 97 ( 6 ) 1687 – 1699 1688 Neumann and Gottschalk 78 The effective work done during the separation of the complex was calcu - lated by W eff ð x Þ ¼ X x i % x i F eff ð x i Þ (cid:2) ð x i (cid:3) x i (cid:3) 1 Þ : ( 2 ) These work curves W eff ( x ) were then averaged for each pulling velocity of Setups 2 and 3 . No average work distributions for Setups 1 and 1 m were calculated since no unbinding is seen . RESULTS To understand the inﬂuence of force application on the complex , the unfolding pathways need to be described . Due to the high complexity of the system , an approach to reduce this complexity to a small set of descriptive parame - ters is needed . We analyzed the unbinding pathways by deﬁning charac - teristic contacts in the protein , which open during the simula - tion . A careful analysis of our trajectories led to the deﬁnition of the ﬁve speciﬁc contacts for the description of the unfolding pathways . The contacts 1 and 3 are within Barstar . The contact 2 is a contact within Barnase , while the contacts 4 and 5 are between both complex partners ( Fig . 1 , Table 2 ) . The calcula - tion of the average ﬂuctuations of these speciﬁc contacts during the whole equilibration show stochastic ﬂuctuations TABLE 1 The average maximum forces ( unfolding for Setups 1 and 1 m ; unbinding for Setups 2 and 3 ) for the different pulling velocities are given with the standard deviation of the forces as error ; h . i denotes the average Velocity Attachment Loading rate / pNns h F max i / pN Error / pN No . of trajectoriespathway / total number per setup Setup 1 , unfolding Barnase Fast C - C 5320 951 61 12 / 77 Medium C - C 1330 799 55 24 / 31 Slow C - C 332 , 5 753 61 7 / 12 Barstar Fast C - C 5320 903 82 67 / 77 Medium C - C 1330 809 58 14 / 31 Slow C - C 332 , 5 762 33 5 / 12 Setup 1 m , unfolding Barnase Fast C - C 5320 827 57 70 / 73 Medium C - C 1330 732 53 15 / 15 Slow C - C 332 , 5 737 97 12 / 12 Barstar Fast C - C 5320 855 1 / 73 Setup 2 , unbindingFast COM - COM 5320 1310 95 9 / 67 Medium COM - COM 1330 1123 65 10 / 10 Slow COM - COM 332 , 5 938 97 8 / 8 Setup 3 , unbindingFast Helix - COM 5320 1702 175 55 / 55 Medium Helix - COM 1330 1332 214 10 / 10 Slow Helix - COM 332 , 5 1168 201 8 / 8 FIGURE 1 ( A ) Contact points for the analysis of the pathways .

Biophysical Journal 97 ( 6 ) 1687 – 1699 The Effect of Force on Barnase - Barstar 1689 79 of their C a – C a distances of < 0 . 05 nm . This indicates that they areinstableregionsoftheproteincomplex . However , depend - ing on the setup , these contacts separate at certain times in our simulation . A contact is deﬁned as separated if the speciﬁc C a – C a distance of the contact is increased by 0 . 5 nm relative to the starting structure of the simulation ( Fig . 2 ) . The path - ways are characterized by the pulled distances d 1 – d 5 , at which these speciﬁc contacts separate . If the contact did not separate during the simulation , the respective distance was set to zero . By analyzing the histograms of distances d 1 – d 5 , the response of the protein complex to force can be described . Setups 1 and 1 m In Setups 1 and 1 m , we chose to simulate the experimental , directly - accessible force application of the acting force to single C a atoms . We examined the effect of the pulling speed on the unfold - ing pathways of the probed protein complex . The system was simulated using three different pulling velocities ( y fast ¼ 2 nmns , y medium ¼ 0 : 5 nmns , and y slow ¼ 0 : 125 nmns ) . We furthermore tested this setup with two mirrored force vectors : ﬁrst , the moving potential was acting on Barstar ( Setup 1 , Fig . 1 ) and second on Barnase ( Setup 1 m ) . The pathways chosen in these setups are well described by the distances d 1 and d 2 ( Fig . 2 ) . The value d 1 is describing the unfolding of the probed Barstar b - sheet , while d 2 is characterizing the concerted motion of the outermost Barstar a - helix away from the core of the protein complex . Setup 1 Here , the force is acting on C a bs 86 , while C a bn 7 is ﬁxed ( bs , Barstar ; bn , Barnase ) . Two main unfolding pathways and a mixture of the two main pathways were observed ( Fig . 3 A , left ) . The unfolding of the Barstar b - sheet , described by d 1 , was the main unfolding pathway at v fast . The characteristic contact broke after a pulled distance of 1 . 7 nm . However , the concerted movement of the Barnase a - helix shearing away from the core of the protein , described by d 2 , was the main event at the slower pulling speeds ( y medium and y slow ) . Here , the contact broke after a pulled distance of ~ 1 . 4 nm for the medium and at ~ 0 . 9 nm for the slow pulling velocity . The maximum force on the main pathway are slightly lower than for the alternative pathway ( Table 1 ) . With decreasing pulling velocity , the maximum forces decrease . The mixed unfolding pathway was represented by unfolding at both ends of the protein complex , each side being unfolded analogous to one of the main pathways . Setup 1 m Here , we used the mirrored probing protocol of Setup 1 ( pulling C a bn 7 and ﬁxing C a bs 86 ) . The Setup 1 m shows only one main unfolding pathway . This unfolding of Barnase from the N - terminus is character - ized by a distribution of the unbinding distances d 2 fast ~ 1 . 3 nm , d 2medium ~ 1 . 0 nm , and d 2slow ~ 0 . 9 nm ( Fig . 3 A , right ) . The maximum forces during the unfolding decrease , like in Setup 1 , with the pulling speed . The average maximum forces are much lower than for Setup 1 ( Table 1 ) . Hence , the only speed dependency is shifting the unbinding event to lower pulling distances and lower forces , without switching the unbinding pathway , despite nearly identical simulation parameters . Setup 2 Here , we used a different SMD simulation scheme and pulled at the center - of - mass ( COM ) of the two individual proteins ( Fig . 1 C ) . This resulted in drastic changes in the choice of the pathway compared to Setups 1 and 1 m . A different set of speciﬁc contacts d 3 to d 5 describes the taken pathways ( Fig . 3 B ) . The main pathway of the COM pulling in Setup 2 was a two - step process . The two - dimensional histogram of the unbinding distances shows that the structural distortion of Barstar at d 3 ~ 0 . 9 nm is earlier than the unbinding at d 5 ~ 1 . 7 nm ( Fig . 3 B ) . First , an internal rearrangement in Barstar moved the core of the protein away from the binding helix , leaving the binding site intact . This increased the separation d 3 until all side - chain interactions of the Barstar binding - helix with the core of the Barstar protein were broken . Second , the Barstar binding helix began to unbind from the binding pocket of Barnase , starting from its C - terminal end . This caused the partial unbinding of the complex , char - acterized by d 5 ( Fig . 3 B ) . For medium and slow pulling , all trajectories unbind ( all d 4 > 0 nm ) , whereas , at fast pulling speeds , some trajectories were not fully separated at the end of the simulation . Furthermore , for medium and slow pulling velocities , single trajectories show unbinding of the complex without complex distortions ( d 3 ¼ 0 nm ) . Setup 3 In the third setup , the COM of the C a - atoms of Barstar’s binding helix was pulled ( Fig . 1 D ) . This setup was designed to probe the binding site of the Barnase - Barstar complex directly .

Biophysical Journal 97 ( 6 ) 1687 – 1699 1690 Neumann and Gottschalk 80 Here , the rupture of the Barnase - Barstar complex was described by a continuous unbinding event . It started at one end of Barstar’s binding helix until a fully unbound state was reached . No major distortions in the protein structure of the binding partners were observed . Unbinding that starts the separation at d 4 or d 5 can be observed . Thus , two unbinding pathways exist . For fast pull - ing , both pathways are overlapping . For medium pulling , a separation is indicated . For slow pulling , it can be observed in the two populations in the two - dimensional histogram ( Fig . 3 C ) . The main unbinding pathway shifts from starting separa - tion at the C - terminal end of the Barstar binding helix d 5 at high pulling velocities , to starting with an N - terminal separa - tion ( d 4 ) for medium and slow pulling velocities ( Fig . 3 C ) . The forces during the trajectory increase to a maximum force of h F max i ~ 1 . 8 nN . The comparison of the maximum forces depending on the selected pathway show no signiﬁ - cant differences ( Fig . 4 B ) . The median maximum forces of the major pathway with h F max , 5 i ¼ 1 . 75 nN is only slightly smaller than h F max , 4 i ¼ 1 . 80 nN for the minor pathway . The ruptures occurred after the maximum force peak ( Fig . 4 A ) . We deﬁned the rupture force in Setup 3 as the force F ( t rupt ) at the time of the ﬁrst separation ( t rupt ¼ min ( t 4 , t 5 ) ) . The median of the rupture forces of the major unbinding pathway was h F 5 i ¼ 1056 pN ( t 5 < t 4 ) and , surprisingly , higher than of the minor pathway with h F 4 i ¼ 786 pN ( t 5 > t 4 ) ( Fig . 4 C ) . Since the force describes the slope of the energy landscape , this behavior can be explained with an energy landscape of the unbinding event being an energy funnel with a constantly decreasing slope after the point of the maximum force ( Fig . 4 D ) . Hence , the main unbinding pathway has a steeper slope in the energy landscape at the point of breakage . Viscous drag forces after separation After the separation of the complex in Setups 2 and 3 , the pulling forces exerted on the protein are needed to move the protein through the water . These drag forces F drag were calculated by averaging the forces only after complete sepa - ration ( Table 3 ) . Additional drag forces during the actual unbinding process are not investigated . Therefore , the drag forces calculated here are only a lower limit of the drag forces during the separation . The total amount of the friction due to viscous drag forces of ~ 200 pN show that for all pull - ing velocities , these effects cannot be neglected ( Table 3 ) . A transition from higher to lower drag forces can be seen if the pulling velocity is decreased from fast to medium pulling . No major reduction of the average drag forces can FIGURE 2 Setup 1 . These representative distance curves show the devel - opment of the unfolding parameters d 1 ( black ) and d 2 ( gray ) representing the three different types of pathways taken during the experiment . The arrows mark the ﬁrst time at which the contact showed an increased separation of 0 . 5 - nm larger than the equilibrium distance . This time is deﬁned as the sepa - ration time t 1 or t 2 . The ﬁrst graph represents the main pathway at fast pulling ( A ) , whereas the second shows a typical minor pathway that will become important in the medium pulling ( B ) . The third pathway ( C ) can be described as a superposition of the two main pathways ( A and B ) .

Biophysical Journal 97 ( 6 ) 1687 – 1699 1692 Neumann and Gottschalk 82 be detected when decreasing the pulling velocity from medium to slow speeds . In contrast to this , the average of the maximum pulling forces for Setups 2 and 3 decrease with every pulling velocity reduction ( Table 1 ) . The higher viscous drag forces of Setup 2 compared with Setup 3 during fast pulling can be attributed to the increased surface area of the Barstar in Setup 2 due to the extended protein distortions . However , even though the viscous drag forces are higher in Setup 2 , Setup 3 shows the higher average maximum forces . Effective work of the protein - protein separation For Setups 2 and 3 , the average effective work h W eff ( x ) i on the protein complex depending on the reaction coordinate x ( distance pulled ) was calculated ( Fig . 5 , A and B ) . For both setups , lower pulling velocities result in lower work due to increased sampling of the energy landscape perpen - dicular to the reaction coordinate . The comparison of Setups 2 and 3 shows that the ﬁnal effective work of separation is comparable ( Fig . 5 , C – E ) . The work in Setup 2 is higher due to additional conforma - tional distortions during the separation of the complex . To separate Barnase and Barstar , Setup 2 requires ~ 1 nm addi - tional pulling distance , which leads to an increase in simula - tion time of ~ 66 % compared to Setup 3 . DISCUSSION Free , thermal , and forced unfolding Free , thermal , and chemical unfolding are different from enforced unfolding ( 1 , 10 , 60 ) . The spontaneous unfolding of Barnase , without the complexing Barstar , was shown to differ from the forced unfolding by the import machinery of the Mitochondria . The spontaneous unfolding starts at the center region of the protein ; the forced unfolding starts at the N - terminal end without previously inducing a molten globule state at the import site ( 1 , 10 ) , while thermal unfold - ing induced structural changes within the protein’s core ( 11 ) . These results are in line with our simulations in Setup 1 and Setup 1 m , where for slower pulling we also observe an un - folding starting from the N - terminus of Barstar independent of the force vector . Barnase - Barstar in comparison to other proteins AFM experiments on a fusion protein consisting of a Barnase domain fused to titin I27 domains showed that Barnase unfolds at lower forces than the titin domain . The chimera was pulled at the terminal ends of the proteins ( 11 ) , leading to force vectors analogous to our Setup 1 . To compare these experimental results with our simulation , we extrapolated the titin unfolding forces observed in previous simulations to the loading rates of our simulations . All forces were extrapolated due to their logarithmic dependency on the loading rate ( 9 , 61 ) , TABLE 3 The calculated drag forces of the pulled molecules through water after the complete separation of the protein complex h F drag i / pN stdDev ( h F drag i ) / pN No . of separations No . of trajectories Setup 2 Fast 253 25 9 67 Medium 178 10 10 10 Slow 176 22 8 8 Setup 3 Fast 207 20 55 55 Medium 173 7 10 10 Slow 171 5 8 8 A C B D FIGURE 4 Setup3 .

This leads to F rupt ð y 1 Þ (cid:3) F rupt ð y 2 Þ ¼ a (cid:2) ln (cid:4) y 1 y 2 (cid:5) ( 4 ) and results in an extrapolation formula for the rupture force of F extr ð y Þ ¼ a (cid:2) ln y y 1 þ F rupt ð y 1 Þ ( 5 ) with a ¼ k B T D x ¼ F rupt ð y 1 Þ (cid:3) F rupt ð y 2 Þ ln (cid:4) y 1 y 2 (cid:5) ; ( 6 ) where two data points ( y i , F rupt ( y i ) ) need to be known . The loading rates in Eqs . 5 and 6 are dimensionless . In agreement with experiment , the average maximum forces of the Barnase unfolding in Setup 1 ( 951 pN ) and Setup 1 m ( 828 pN ) are lower than the extrapolated unfolding forces of the titin domain I27 of 1228 pN ( Table 4 ) ( 62 ) . Also the unfolding forces of titin domain I1 in its oxidized ( F extr ¼ 1171pN ) aswellasitsreducedform ( F extr ¼ 1022pN ) are higher ( Table 4 ) . The pull - and - wait pulling protocol by Pabo´n and Amzel produced an even higher Force peak of 1440 pN ( 63 ) . Since only one loading rate pair is known , this force was not extrapolated . The energy for the unfolding of the force - transmitting domain I27 of titin ( 500 kcalmol ) ( 64 ) is much higher than for the unbinding of the Barnase - Barstar system ( < 150 kcalmol in Table 5 ) . These data demonstrate the mechanical instability of the Barnase - Barstar system as opposed to the titin family , a family that is designed to operate in a force - exerting environment . The extrapolated unbinding forces of reported data on Barnase unfolding ( 11 ) are comparable to our unbinding forces within the error , if not higher ( Table 4 ) . This indicates that due to the N - terminal unfolding of Barnase , the protein is not signiﬁcantly stabilized by being complexed with Barstar . Antibody - antigen interactions , where the antigen is a small helical peptide , showed lower unbinding forces compared to our results of Setups 2 and 3 , but comparable forces to our unfolding forces ( Tables 1 and 4 ) . This demonstrates 1 ) , the high afﬁnity of the Barnase - Barstar complex ; and 2 ) , the low mechanical stability of the complex . The rupture forces observed for the TCR - pMHC complex and cytochrome c 2 exceed the forces observed in our simu - lations ( Table 4 ) ( 35 , 37 ) . A C E D B FIGURE 5 The effective work versus the pulled distance as reaction coordinate for Setup 2 ( A ) and Setup 3 ( B ) is shown . The work decreases with decreasing pulling velocity from fast pulling at 2 m / s ( highest work curve ) , over medium pulling at 0 . 5 m / s ( middle work curve ) , to slow pulling at 0 . 125 m / s ( lowest work curve ) . The separation of the Barnase - Barstar complex is reached at comparable average effective work values for both setups , but for a sepa - ration in Setup 2 one needs ~ 1 nm additional pulling compared to Setup 3 . The direct comparison of the work in Setup 2 and 3 for fast ( C ) , medium ( D ) , and slow ( E ) pull - ing is also shown . ( Setup 2 ranges from 0 – ~ 2 . 5nm ; Setup 3 from 0 – ~ 1 . 5nm ) . Biophysical Journal 97 ( 6 ) 1687 – 1699 1694 Neumann and Gottschalk 84 In a biological context , the mechanical instability contrasts the equilibrium afﬁnity of the complex . Under equilibrium conditions , the complex has an extremely low off - rate and virtually never unbinds . The equilibrium stability of the complex poses some conceptual problems : while within the cell , Barnase certainly needs to be complexed to ensure cell survival , and the complex somehow must be opened to export Barnase . The mechanical instability may be needed to unfold the complex during export of Barnase to the extra - cellular space , which would allow the inhibitor to unbind only at the point of export , and which is consistent with the N - terminal position of the signal peptide . This would pose an interesting balance between different aspects of mechanical - versus - equilibrium stability , which would ensure maximum protection of the cell while allowing for unbinding during export . Inﬂuence of drag force For fast probing , the complex is unfolding at different ends of the complex ( Fig . 3 A ) in Setups 1 and 1 m . Since all other parameters are identical , the reason for this different behavior is the opposite direction of the probing force vector . The pulling force F pull is compensated by the harmonic potential holding the protein ( F hold ) and the opposing pres - sure of the solvent F solv ( viscous drag ) . The harmonic poten - tials ( F pull and F hold ) are invariant to the pulling direction . Therefore , in the absence of solvent , one would not expect differences between Setups 1 and 1 m . However , the solvent causes a strongly direction - dependent drag force , which is also sensitive to the attachment point of the force . Due to the viscous drag , F pull > F hold under nonequilib - rium conditions . Therefore , in Setup 1 , F bs > F bn and in Setup 1 m , F bn > F bs . These differences in force caused by drag can explain the observed differences in the trajectories at high loading rates . At lower loading rates , the inﬂuence of the drag force is reduced ( Table 3 ) , rendering the simulations more similar ( Fig . 3 ) . For dual unfolding at both ends , two barriers need to be overcome , reducing the probability of such events . Distortions in Setups 1 and 1 m At fast loading rates , due to the unfolding of Barstar’s ﬁnal b - sheet , the structural core of the protein gets disturbed in Setup 1 .

Biophysical Journal 97 ( 6 ) 1687 – 1699 The Effect of Force on Barnase - Barstar 1695 85 structural core of Barnase , in contrast , leaves all the secondary structure elements intact . Only a few contacts between helix and structural core are broken ( Fig . 6 ) . The lateral unbinding of the N - terminal helix of Barnase is a gradual , zipperlike process , while the unfolding of the Barstar b - sheet is a cata - strophic , cooperative event ( Fig . 6 ) . The shearing of a b - sheet has been implicated to be energetically more costly : it has been shown thatthe lateralshearing ofhelix pairs ( comparable to the shearing away of Barnase’s helix observed here ) is energetically more favorable than the shearing of b - sheets ( Tables 4 and 5 ) ( 23 ) . Furthermore , Gra¨ter et al . showed that the probed geometry of b - sheets is very stable ( 32 ) . Our obser - vations at slow pulling velocities , where the system has more time to relax orthogonally to the pulling vector and where the unfolding of the Barstar b - sheet is not observed , support this notion . At slower pulling velocities , only the shearing of the helix is observed , being the thermodynamically more favorable process . AFM experiments as well as theoretical considerations showed the mechanical lability of Barnase and Barstar ( 11 , 60 , 65 ) ( Tables 4 and 5 ) , in line with the unfolding observed here . In particular , Barnase was suggested to unfold during mitochondrial import at forces as low as ~ 10 pN ( 60 ) . Hence , the unfolding of Barnase does not seem to be an artifact of the pulling velocities employed . Distortions in Setups 2 and 3 To avoid unfolding in the simulations and to gain approxi - mate insight into equilibrium barriers , different simulation schemes need to be employed ( 37 ) . One possibility would be to go to signiﬁcantly lower velocities approaching adia - batic conditions , which is hampered by the accompanied computational cost . Recently , Cuendet and Michielin devel - oped an attractive simulation scheme , where the steering force acts only in the direction of the reaction coordinate ( 37 ) . For the sake of simplicity , we changed the attachment of the probing force and pulled at the centers - of - mass of different groups of the complex . Unbinding simulations of complexes often used larger pulling / attachment groups for avoiding unfolding ( 35 – 37 ) . Attaching the pulling and holding forces to the COM of the molecules distributed the applied tension equally over the whole molecules ( Setup 2 ) . Although these simulations are not easily reproduced by AFM measurements , they nevertheless can give insight into aspects of the complex observable by other techniques like double mutant cycle or folding measurements . The resulting structural distortions of the Barstar show that the overall structural integrity of Barstar is weaker than that of Barnase , as also shown exper - imentally ( Table 5 ) .

Biophysical Journal 97 ( 6 ) 1687 – 1699 1696 Neumann and Gottschalk 86 We probe here the stability of the binding of this helix to Barnase , relative to the binding strength to its own protein core in a differential force assay . Since the here - probed off - rate of the complex is dominated by van der Waals interactions , our results demonstrate that these interactions of Barstar’s binding helix with its own protein core are weaker than the interaction with the active side of the RNase Barnase . In an evolutionary point of view , the blocking of the active site of the Barnase is essential to prevent damage to its parental bacterium , while the interac - tion of Barstar’s binding helix with its own protein core is only necessary for the orientation of its charges in the asso - ciation process ( 66 , 67 ) . These charges destabilized Barstar additionally , facilitating the unfolding of the inhibitor ( 43 ) , in agreement with our results . For even lower pulling velocities than used here , the distortions will probably not be observed , as indicated by rare events at slow pulling velocities . Directly addressing the pulling forces to Barstar’s binding helix ( Setup 3 ) results in unbinding without structural distor - tions . The stiffness of the helix ( 23 ) distributes the external mechanical tension over the binding interface . The majority of all direct Barnase - Barstar interactions are mediated by this helix . Unbinding pathways In Setup 3 , unbinding pathways without structural distortions are observed . The high maximum forces ( Table 1 ) point to a very strong binding of the inhibitor to its RNase . A closer examination of the complex unbinding reveals that the main unbinding pathway started separating the complex from the C - terminal end of Barstar’s binding helix for fast pulling , and from the N - terminal for medium and slow pulling ( Fig . 3 C , right ) . For both pathways , the last contacts involve Arg bn 59 , Asp bs 35 , and Asp bs 39 ( Fig . 7 ) . These residues have been implicated to be important for the association pathway of the complex under equilibrium conditions , in particular the loop from residue 57 to residue 60 of Barnase ( 41 , 48 ) . This indicates that the observed , enforced dissociation pathways are a good approximation of equilibrium association path - ways . Based on Brownian dynamics simulations , the overlap of association and dissociation pathways has been suggested before ( 51 ) . The agreement of our simulated dissociation pathway with proposed association pathways shows that the probing of the central helix allows us to sample essential barriers of the equilibrium trajectory .

More complex nonequilibrium simulation schemes of a large protein - protein complex did not reach a better agreement ( 37 ) . The effective work values of Setups 2 and 3 show that the conformational distortions in Setup 2 require additional work , especially for the faster and medium pulling velocities ( Table 5 ) . We did not attempt to use nonequilibrium analysis schemes like the Jarzynski relation ( 68 ) . These relations depend on the observation of rare events . The probability of these events becomes negligible with increasing dissipa - tion and system size ( 69 ) . Standard evaluation schemes use the cumulative expansion of the Jarzynski relation , which is dependent on a Gaussian distribution of work values ( 69 ) . A Gaussian distribution is not usually observed in simulations with a limited number of trajectories ( 37 ) . CONCLUSION The velocity and geometry of the force application have a strong effect on the evolution of a system . Rapidly changing a system may probe the lability of the energy landscape . This may be very different from slow changes , which test the stability of the system . Furthermore , the different attachment points of force have a severe inﬂuence on the ﬁnal conforma - tion . Summarizing , we showed that an atomistic under - standing of unbinding or unfolding pathways needs the application of a variety of force protocols . The applied forces alter the energy landscape in a nontrivial way . The resulting propagation of the probed protein through phase space does not only critically depend on the geometry of force applica - tion , but equally on the velocity of force application . There - fore , for a thorough characterization of the effect of force on a protein complex , multiple simulations with different probing geometries and different velocities need to be performed , carefully testing the lability and stability of the system . Sophisticated attachment simulation schemes allow rapid , but approximate insight into the main barriers of the dissociation pathways , deepening our understanding of the observed system and helping in the design of experiments .

They bind the extracellular matrix and transduce forces to the intracellular space . Talin binds to the cytoplasmic ! - tail of the integrin with its head domain and links them to the actin cytoskeleton with its rod domain . Hence , the integrin - talin complex acts as the force linkage between the extracellular matrix and the cytoskeleton of the cell . In this study , we show that the associated conformation of the integrin transmembrane domains in the integrins resting state can interact with talin without steric clashes . Therefore , talin binding alone may not be sufficient for integrin activation . However , a small force of 20 pN applied to the integrin talin complex breaks a salt bridge between the integrins ! - and " - subunit . The salt bridge has previously been shown to lock the integrin in its resting state . Therefore , we propose that the integrin activation by talin is force - assisted . The application of constant forces in the range of 20 - 500 pN to the integrin - talin complex leads to ( partial ) dissociation of the complex . The pathway of dissociation depends on the direction of the force vector . Forces parallel to the membrane lead to a zipper - like unbinding . Forces normal to the membrane induce strengthening of the complex by formation of a talin - binding beta strand in the integrin tail . This mechanism strengthens the integrin - talin complex at the leading edge of the cell , where forces normal to the membrane facilitate integrin activation . Our results indicate that the integrin - talin complex is physiologically optimized to be strengthened by applied forces only at certain locations within the cell . Author Summary Cells can adhere to the extracellular matrix in the bloodstream , they migrate , and they feel and respond to the mechanical properties of their environment . In all these tasks , cells are either exposed to external forces or exert forces to their environment . This requires protein complexes optimized for withstanding forces . One of these complexes is the intracellular complex of integrin , a cell adhesion receptor , with talin , an adaptor protein that links integrins 92 3 to the cytoskeleton and to many signaling molecules . During the mechanical cycle of cell migration , talin needs to bind strongly to integrins at certain location of the cell and to be released from integrins at other locations of the cell . By using computational simulations of the integrin - talin complex under force , we show here that the direction of force application on this vector alters the resistance of this complex to forces . This implies that by altering the vector of forces acting on the complex , the cell can regulate the strength of the complex and tune it to the needs at a specific cellular location . Introduction Forces impact biological life on different length scales ranging from whole organisms to individual proteins . Force is a vectorial quantity , which acts directionally on proteins . Its effect on proteins is not only dependent on the magnitude of the force , but also on the direction of the force vector [ 1 - 5 ] . Recently , forces are recognized as important regulatory mechanisms in cellular events like cell adhesion and cell migration [ 6 , 7 ] . Both experiments and computation showed that the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin and the rod domain of the intracellular adaptor protein talin unfold partially under physiological stress to expose hidden binding sites [ 8 , 9 ] . For these force - triggered signaling events , forces must be transduced from the extracellular matrix to the cytoskeleton . The most important family of proteins to transduce forces through the cellular membrane are the integrins . Integrins form mechanical and signaling connections from the extracellular matrix over the talin adaptor proteins to the actin cytoskeleton [ 10 - 15 ] . Integrin affinity to extracellular ligands is regulated by the binding of intracellular adaptor proteins like talin or kindlin [ 16 - 21 ] . The activation of integrins is accompanied by a conformational change of its extracellular domain [ 22 ] . This conformational change is triggered by separating the transmembrane helices of the integrins’ ! - and " - subunit for inside - out signaling [ 6 ] . Helix separation is supposedly caused by talin binding to the intracellular domain of the integrin " - subunit , pushing away the ! - subunit [ 23 ] . Forces have 93 4 been identified as an additional regulatory mechanism for the conformation of the integrins extracellular domains , depending on the direction of the applied forces [ 24 ] . The integrin - activating protein talin binds the cytoplasmic integrin ! - tails predominantly with its FERM domain and actin with its rod domain [ 25 , 26 ] . Hence , talin acts as a force clamp between the integrin and the cytoskeleton . Figure 1A shows schematically how forces are propagated between the extracellular domain and the cytoskeleton through the integrin - talin complex . Here , we are interested in the effect of forces to the integrin - talin complex . To investigate this , we firstly equilibrate the recently published complex structure of talin - 2 FERM F3 domain binding the integrin ! 1D cytoplasmic tail in a 100 ns molecular dynamics simulation [ 27 ] . Alignment of our 100 ns equilibrated structure with the recently solved transmembrane complex of the integrin " IIb ! 3 shows that talin binding does not sterically replace the " - subunit of the integrin complex . Secondly , we probe the integrin - ! 1D talin - F3 FERM subdomain complex with constant forces in molecular dynamics simulations . Further , we study the impact of forces on this complex . Our simulations show that physiological forces of 20 pN induce a conformational change , which potentially activates the integrin . This is the force range at which the talin rod starts to decrypt its vinculin binding sites [ 9 ] . Single molecule force measurements with laser tweezers and atomic force microscopes measured peak rupture forces of the integrin - fibronectin complex of 80 - 100 pN and 120 pN respectively [ 28 , 29 ] . Since integrin activation timescales are in the order of seconds , our simulations feature higher forces ( up to 500 pN ) to speed up dissociation processes . Applying constant force in different directions , we identify the sequence of intermediate dissociation states for forces parallel and normal to the membrane . For forces normal to the membrane we observe a force induced strengthening of the integrin - talin complex . This is caused by the formation of a force - resistant ! - sheet between talin and integrin . We further show that when free to rotate the complex orients such that the force vector allows the formation of this ! - sheet . This constitutes a self - enforcing mechanism of the integrin - talin bond . 94 5 Figure 1 : ( A ) Schematic of force linkage from cytoskeleton ( violet ) to the extracellular matrix ( orange ) through the talin ( green ) integrin ( cyan / blue ) complex . The blue box indicates the structure in ( B ) . ( B ) Structural representation of the talin - 2 FERM domain ( green ) binding the cytoplasmic tail of the integrin ! 1D - tail .

The inlay shows the sizes of the larges clusters resulting from clustering of the equilibration . ( B ) Representative structure of the most populated cluster of 100 ns equilibration of the talin - 2 F3 ( green ) integrin " 1D - tail ( cyan ) complex . The black boxes indicate the positions of the zoom in graphs ( C - E ) . Here , we study the interface of the integrin - talin complex consisting of the cytoplasmic integrin " 1D - tail bound to the talin - 2 F3 FERM subdomain . Figure 1B highlights the position of the simulated system in context with the membrane position and the complete talin - 2 FERM domain . Figure 2A shows the time - development of the root mean square displacement ( RMSD ) of the C ! - atoms of the protein . The 100 ns equilibrium simulation reaches a stable plateau at an RMSD of ~ 0 . 2nm ( Figure 2a ) . The structures from the equilibration run are clustered . One cluster dominates ( Figure 2a - inset ) . A representative conformation of this cluster has been chosen as start conformation for further simulations . Based on the analysis of the root mean square fluctuations of the individual amino acids during the equilibrium simulation , the binding interface of the simulated complex can be divided into three modular 96 7 regions . The first is the integrin’s membrane proximal helix region . It is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions of the phenylalanines ! 1D - F 763 and ! 1D - F 766 as well as by the hydrogen bonds of the charged amino acids ! 1D - D 759 , ! 1D - E 767 and ! 1D - E 769 ( Figure 2C ) . The second region is located at the integrin tryptophane ! 1D - W 775 . This tryptophane is bound into a deep hydrophobic binding pocket and may be additionally stabilized via a cation - " interaction with the talin’s ! 1D - R 361 ( Figure 2D ) . The third region stabilizes the integrin ! 1D - 780 NPIY 783 motif via a network of hydrogen bonds ( Figure 2E ) . All those tight binding amino acids show low root mean square fluctuation ( RMSF ) during the 100 ns equilibration of the talin - 2 F3 integrin ! 1D complex ( Figure 3A ) . The regions between the integrins’ binding modules have higher flexibility and may therefore be of less importance for binding . To further analyse the importance of these residues , we perform a multiple sequence alignment . The tight binding amino acids are highly conserved , underlining the importance for integrity of the complex ( Figure 3B ) . Figure 3 : ( A ) Average amino acid root mean square fluctuations ( RMSF ) of 100 ns free equilibration color coded onto structure ( red = high , white = intermediate and blue = low RMSF ) . ( B ) The integrin’s amino acid sequence is colored according to its conservation like in 3A ( except for white being replaced by black ) . The height of the letters indicates their evolutionary conservation . 97 8 To analyze our simulated fragment in a larger structural context , we align current structures of the transmembrane complex of integrin ! IIb " 3 [ 27 ] and of the whole talin FERM domain [ 30 ] with our simulated fragment of the the talin - 2 F3 / integrin ! 1D complex ( Figure 4 ) . Surprisingly , the talin head binding to the integrin ! - tail does not sterically disturb the binding between the integrin’s " - ! - TM - helices . Directional Force Probing Simulations The full - length integrin structure continues N - terminally through the membrane to its ECM binding site . The C - terminus of the talin F3 domain is attached through the talin rod domain to the actin cytoskeleton of the cell . Cellular forces acting on the cytoskeleton are transduced through the integrin - talin complex to the ECM ( Figure 1A ) . Applying 20 pN between the integrin’s C - and the talin’s N - terminus to reproduce physiological conditions lead to talin F3 subdomain rotation , if the forces are applied end - to - end in a direction parallel to the putative Figure 4 : The figures show the talin ( green ) binding the integrin ! - tail ( cyan ) . ( A ) and ( B ) show both sides of the complex . The talin does not interfere with the integrin " - tail ( blue ) . Inlay in ( A ) shows the position of the zoomed in structures . Inlay ( B ) shows an essential transmembrane salt - bridge . 98 9 plane of the membrane ( Figure 5 ) . After rotation , the forces correspond to a vector normal to the putative plane of the membrane . No rotation is observed if the forces are applied normal to the plane of the membrane ( Figure 5 ) . Hence , in the absence of a membrane the complex orients itself such that forces normal to the putative plane of the membrane act on it . A rotational movement may be hampered in the cell by interactions with the cell membrane and stabilizing influence of the F2 FERM domain . Furthermore , we are interested in the question how different force vectors influence the complex . Therefore , to prevent talin from rotation , we constrained the C ! - atoms of the talin F3 domain by a weak force . The constant force is applied only to the integrin N - terminus . Figure 5 : Effect of different force vectors to the relative orientation of the complex over time . A & C : Angle of the vector between the N - terminal Ca of Integrin and the C - terminal CA of Talin during 2 . 5 ns of simulation at a force of 20 pN is shown with respect to the vector at time zero . B : The rotation of the complex during parallel force application is shown . Constant forces between 20 and 500 pN are applied parallel ( P ) and normal ( N ) to the putative plane of the cell membrane ( Fig . 2B ) . To analyze the enforced dissociation , we have 99 10 chosen the integrin - talin COM - COM distance as a reaction coordinate . Figures 6C and D show its time evolution for all trajectories at 200 pN for normal and parallel forces . From these time traces normalized histograms are generated . The normalized histograms of the integrin - talin COM - COM distances are calculated for each probing force and direction ( Figures 6A and B ) . The peaks indicate stable intermediate states . The ground state shows a stable and sharp probability distribution at 20 - 50 pN for normal pulling . The parallel pulling is less stable and already starts destabilizing at 50 pN . Figure 6 : ( A ) and ( B ) show the reaction coordinate for multiple trajectories at 200 pN as well as the corresponding histograms for parallel and normal pulling respectively . The red areas in the histograms were identified as regions representing different dissociation states . ( C ) and ( D ) show the probability histograms of the talin integrin COM - COM distance depending on the applied constant force for parallel and normal pulling respectively . Both setups show two prominent intermediate peaks before dissociation . The dissociation within 20 ns starts at 200 pN for parallel forces and at 400 pN for normal forces . Thus , the talin integrin complex is more resistant to the application of forces normal to the plane of the membrane . 100 11 To understand the dependence of the complex stability on the direction of the force , we reconstructed the dissociation pathways . The states are determined by an automated peak detection in the COM - COM histograms for each force at each probing direction . A representative structure for each peak is obtained . Based on these structures we reconstruct the dissociation pathways ( Figures 7 and 8 ) . 101 12 Figure 7 : Force dissociation pathway with force parallel to membrane Figure 8 : Force dissociation pathway with force normal to membrane Figures 7 and 8 : each box shows the general state of the protein complex with a box marking the position of the zoom in figure with the important amino acids and their labels . Hydrogen bonds are shown in blue . Opened hydrogen bonds are indicated in red . Gray surfaces represent van - der - Waals surfaces . 102 13 Dissociation Pathway under Forces Parallel to Membrane Forces parallel to the membrane cause the integrin dissociation from the talin in four main steps ( Figure 7 ) . First , the integrin helix bends away from the talin and the H - bond between ! 1D - D 759 and F3 - K 337 ruptures ( Fig . 7A ) . For the second step , two pathways exist : either the N - terminal integrin helix loop unfolds ( Fig . 7B - 1 ) or the integrin helix dissociates cooperatively ( Fig 7B - 2 ) . For this cooperative dissociation ! 1D - E 767 to ! 1D - E 769 form a hinge axis around which the helix rotates . The ! 1D - F 763 unbinds from is hydrophobic talin binding pocket . Third , the integrin helix dissociates completely and the ! 1D - W 775 binding site is probed directly ( Fig . 7C ) . Stable ! 1D - W 775 binding to its pocket can be observed up to 100 pN . After the unbinding of the ! 1D - W 775 the hydrogen bond network around the ! 1D - 780 NPxY 783 motif ( Fig 7D ) is the only binding module left . The integrin residues ! 1D - Q 778 , ! 1D - N 780 and ! 1D - Y 783 each bind to talin by at least two H - bonds . Thus , each has an increased rebinding probability if one hydrogen bond ruptures . The talin F3 - R 361 directly couples F3 - D 382 to ! 1D - Q 778 and the ! 1D - Y 783 H - bond network connects to F3 - K 369 and F3 - E 385 . Thus , forces can be distributes to multiple strands of the talin molecule in parallel . In the integrin - talin COM - COM time trace in Figure 6A , the last plateau corresponds to the state in which only the integrin’s NPxY motif is bound . At 200 pN the plateau is reached after 2 - 3 ns , but only one out of seven trajectories shows total dissociation within 20 ns . Thus , the hydrogen bond network around the NPxY motif is the most stable binding module in this setup . Normal dissociation pathway Applying forces normal to the membrane causes a different dissociation behavior . Five steps lead to dissociation . Two pathways are found . First , the ! 1D - D 759 unbinds from F3 - K 337 and - in contrast to parallel force application - rebinds to F3 - K 329 ( Fig 8A ) . The second step shows again two possible pathways : either the hydrophobic interaction of the phenylalanines ! 1D - F 763 and ! 1D - F 766 ( Fig . 8B - 2 ) or the hydrogen bonds of the glutamic acids ! 1D - E 767 and ! 1D - E 769 ( Fig 8B - 1 ) are stable . The two N - 103 14 terminal integrin helix loops as well as the ! 1D - D 759 unbind in either case . In case of stable hydrogen bonds , the axis ! 1D - E 767 to ! 1D - E 769 acts as a hinge to allow a reorientation of the integrin helix along the direction of the force . The C - terminal loop of the helix opens to allow this rotation . In the third step , the integrin helix dissociates completely except for the ! 1D - E 769 still binding to F3 - K 377 . The integrin helix is now completely unfolded . This N - terminal integrin tail aligns with the force direction . This allows the ! 1D - M 771 backbone to bind to the F3 - K 377 . Here , the applied mechanical work is partly dissipated into the talin . The ! 1D - W 775 binding site is probed partially , but the integrin’s flexible ! 1D - 776 DTQ 778 loop is not yet stretched . This allows the ! 1D - Q 778 to induce a ! - sheet binding with the talin ( Fig 8C red ) . Next , F3 - K 377 and then ! 1D - W 775 unbind . Stable ! 1D - W 775 binding in the hydrophobic pocket can be found up to 250pN . After its dissociation the integrin tail is stretched along the talin . This reorientation facilitates the growth of the ! - sheet between talin and integrin ( Fig 8D ) . In addition , the ! 1D - W 775 can form an additional stabilizing hydrogen bond to F3 - T 380 . The combination of the talin integrin ! - sheet binding and the three hydrogen bonds of the ! 1D - N 780 to talin form a very stable complex . Complete dissociation of the integrin - talin complex within 20 ns starts only at 400 pN . After the first dissociation of the talin integrin complex , the integrin shows rebinding to the talin via four hydrogen bonds ( Figure 8E ) . Again F3 - K 377 is very important . This state is short lived . Discussion The integrin - talin interaction is an essential part of the force transduction network from the ECM to the cellular cytoskeleton ( Figure 1 ) . Here , we highlight two main aspects resulting from our simulations . First , we discuss the structural alignment of talin - head binding to the integrin TM helix bundle without distortions . Second , we show that the integrin - talin complex can be understood as a sensor of the direction of the applied forces important for cellular motion . 104 15 Structural Discussion Integrins bi - directionally signal across the cell membrane . This involves TM helix dissociation [ 31 - 34 ] , which then causes conformational changes in the integrins extracellular domain [ 24 , 35 ] . Recently , the structure of the integrin ! IIb " 3 - TM complex has been solved [ 27 ] . This complex is stabilized by the inner membrane clasp consisting of two main interactions . These are the inter - helical hydrophobic core ! IIb - 992 FF 993 with " 3 - W 715 and the salt bridge ! IIb - R 995 to " 3 - D 723 . This salt bridge is thought to be disrupted by the F3 talin head binding to the integrin tail [ 23 , 36 ] . In our work , we create a structural model encompassing the integrin ! - " - TM - helices and the complete talin head . This model shows that the talin head domain can bind the integrin ! - " - TM - helix bundle without disturbing the inner membrane claps interactions . Therefore , a purely sterical mechanism of activation may not be sufficient . The " 1D - D 759 / F3 - K 337 interaction can cause a conformational change to replace the ! IIb - R 995 / " 3 - D 723 salt bridge as suggested earlier [ 36 ] . Hence , talin offers competing interaction partners and with this thermodynamically de - stabilizes the integrin TM complex . Yet , the energetic difference between a " 1D - D 759 / F3 - K 337 and a ! IIb - R 995 / " 3 - D 723 is probably small , which might cause not complete structural re - arrangements . Therefore , further mechanisms enhancing such a mechanism may be desirable . Our simulations show that the integrin helix loops connecting the two essential amino acids " 3 - W 715 and " 3 - D 723 are one of the first regions of secondary structures to unfold even at the physiologically low forces of 20 pN . This may in fact be a lower estimate of the forces needed , since stabilizing membrane components are missing . In a context of an intact TM complex of the integrins’ ! - and " - subunits , this unfolding would disrupt the ! - " - TM - helix interactions ( Figure 9 ) . Therefore , a small force applied to the integrin - talin complex results in the breakage of the salt bridge ! IIb - R 995 to " 3 - D 723 . This destabilizes the integrins’ ! - " - TM - helix interactions . Hence , our results indicate that full integrin activation is fascilitated by a small force acting at the integrin talin complex . The rotation of the talin head by ~ 20° to enable the binding of talin’s positively charged residues to the cell membrane proposed earlier causes a mechanical stress . This stress might already be sufficient to cause the required forces for integrin activation [ 36 , 37 ] . 105 16 In addition , forces acting normal to the membrane enable ! 3 - D 723 to bind to F3 - K 329 . This hydrogen bond is more stable at higher forces ( up to 50 pN ) than the initial ! 1D - D 759 / F3 - K 337 interaction . Figure 9 : ( A ) Integrin " - TM helix ( blue ) binds integrin ! - TM - helix ( cyan ) . Outer salt bridge ! 1D - D 759 to " IIb - R 995 shown as sticks . Both parallel ( B ) and normal ( C ) forces open salt bridge ( red lines ) . Force response of the talin integrin complex Integrins are the major force sensors of cells . They convert the physical stimulus ‘force’ into a biochemical signal . How the forces stimulate cellular responses is still debated . Talin is one of the key players in force sensing [ 11 , 38 - 40 ] . It has been proposed that forces applied to talin lead to local unfolding which exposes hidden binding sites [ 9 ] . Previously , Puklin - Faucher et al . proposed that force applied to the integrin - talin complex can both activate and de - activate the integrins [ 41 ] . During this cycle , forces activate integrins in the leading edge , while they de - activated them in the trailing edge . Our results show that the complex dissociation under force depends on the direction of the applied force . The complex dissociation is more stable against pulling normal to the membrane than parallel to it . Under physiological conditions , this effect would be enhanced by the attractive coulomb interactions between talin and the phospholipids of the cell membrane [ 30 ] . Since the binding free energy of a complex does not change with the unbinding force direction , the integrin - talin complex has direction dependent binding and unbinding barriers . 106 17 We will discuss the three modular interaction sites of the integrin - talin complex individually before the general biological implications are considered ( Figure 2 ) . The membrane proximal integrin helix is bound via the hydrophobic interactions of ! 1D - F 763 and ! 1D - F 766 as well as via hydrogen bonds of ! 1D - D 759 , ! 1D - E 767 and ! 1D - E 769 . All these are highly conserved and their low fluctuations indicate strong binding ( Figure 3B ) . The corresponding hydrophobic interactions for the ! 3 - integrin tail were found to be important for activation in the first chimerical structure of the membrane proximal integrin ! 3 - tail binding to the talin - 1 F3 - domain [ 23 ] . The higher stability in normal force setups at low forces results from the rebinding of the ! 1D - D 759 to another lysine F3 - K 329 . The hydrogen bonds of the ! 1D - E 767 and ! 1D - E 769 are strong enough , that they can act as a hinge region in case of a cooperative unbinding of the integrin helix . This hinge region would be a reasonable mechanism for the cooperative rotation of the integrin helix by ~ 20° as proposed in the integrin activation by Anthis et al . [ 36 ] . The membrane distal region has two modular binding sites separated by the very flexible ! 1D - 776 DTQ 778 loop : the ! 1D - W 775 and the ! 1D - 780 NPIY 783 region ( Figure 2 ) . The tryptophane ! 1D - W 775 is bound in its hydrophobic pocket and may be stabilized by a cation - " interaction with the parallel F3 - R 361 [ 25 , 42 ] . The ! 1D - W 775 binding site is again direction dependent . Forces parallel to the membrane pull the tryptophane on the most direct way out of its binding pocket . For normal forces the binding can resist 2 . 5 times higher forces . This may result from pulling the tryptophane into the direction of the wall instead of out of its binding pocket . The binding module around the NPxY motif consists of many hydrogen bonds and is very stable in both pulling directions . Mutational studies underline the importance of this region : the mutation Y782A abolishes binding [ 43 ] . The fundamental key interaction is the force induced formation of a ! - sheet between integrin and talin ( Figure 10 ) . It is initiated by ! 1D - Q 778 if normal forces are applied . Such a ! - sheet is known to be very force resistant if probed in a shear modus . A prominent example would be the direction dependent force resistant of the ubiquitin [ 44 - 46 ] . The most recent discovery of biological proteins using ! - sheets for force 107 18 resistance is the spider silk [ 47 , 48 ] . Here , we describe for force - induced binding strengthening . Our results further show that , if free to rotate , the complex orients such that this enforcement of the complex is possible . Hence , the integrin - talin complex is optimized as a self - re - enforcing complex . Interestingly , mutations very close to this region drastically improve the affinity of the integrin ! 1D - talin - 2 complex [ 43 ] . Figure 10 : Comparison of crystal structure ( 3G9W ) integrin / talin ! - sheet ( A ) with normal force induced ! - sheet ( B ) which causes increased mechanical resistance . Integrins are activated in the lamellipodium . Here , forces act on the cell membrane due to the fast assembly of actin pushing the cell membrane forward and the actin network backwards [ 49 , 50 ] . These retrograde forces are necessary to initiate focal complexes [ 51 ] . The direction of the forces necessary for activation of the integrins is currently under discussion . While some recent simulations showed an activating conformational change with forces diagonal to the membrane [ 24 ] . Puklin - Faucher et al . argument that forces normal to the membrane are required [ 41 ] . The angle of the force transduction changes with the distance of the adhesion site to the lamellipodium . This is caused because the speed of the actin network changes as the focal adhesion mature and the actin flow slows down [ 51 ] . Recent iPalm measurements recaptured in Figure 9 show the same angle dependence of the talin linkage between integrin and actin [ 15 ] . Our simulations show that the talin integrin complex has the intrinsic ability to react to different force vectors with a force induced strengthening of the complex . Thus , for the activation of the integrin in the leading edge , which requires forces normal to the membrane , the integrin - talin complex is strengthened by the formation of a force resistant ! - sheet between integrin and talin . With time , the integrin 108 19 adhesion matures . The total force resistance in mature focal adhesions may be increased by ligands . All integrins not part of a focal adhesion as well as many nascent adhesion sites are deactivated . Our mechanism predicts , that for non - reinforced integrins , the unbinding is facilitated if the integrins are probed more parallel to the membrane as further away from the lamellipodium . This mechanism adds a molecular description to the mechanical cycle of integrins [ 41 ] . Hence , we show that the initial integrin - talin complex senses the distance to the lamellipodium due to the direction of applied force . In our simulations , as well as in recent structures of the complex , a membrane component is missing . This membrane might be important for further stabilization of the complex through favorable electrostatic interactions between talin and the cell membrane as well as the integrin helix being anchored in the membrane . The effect of the membrane will be tested in future computational studies involving membrane components . Conclusion We have shown , that the talin head binding to the integrin does not sterically disturb the integrin to force a dissociation of the integrins ! - " - TM - helices . Further , we propose a model in which small forces cause a stretching of the integrin " 1D ’s membrane proximal helix . This stretching leads to the dissociation of the essential salt bridge ! IIb - R 995 to " 3 - D 723 between the integrin’s ! - / " - TM helices . Thus , it facilitates an inside - out activation of the integrin . Our simulations show force induced strengthening of the complex for forces normal to the membrane by the formation of a " - sheet between the complex partners . The directional dependence of the force resistance of the integrin - talin bond supports the biological needs for strong nascent adhesion in the leading edge and easily de - activated integrins in the rear of the cell . 109 20 Methods Structure The studied integrin - talin complex consists of the cytoplasmic integrin ! 1D - tail and the talin - 2 F3 FERM subdomain . A subset of the 3G9W structure [ 27 ] without the talin F2 FERM subdomain is used to optimize for computational speed . Molecular Dynamics Simulations All MD simulations are done using the software package GROMACS Version 4 . 05 - 4 . 07 [ 52 - 55 ] with periodic boundary conditions using the OPLS - AA force field [ 56 ] . The structure is solvated in SPC water [ 57 ] with 150mMol NaCl . The energy is minimized using steepest descent method with a maximum step size of 0 . 01nm . The water has been relaxed for 200 ps while the heavy atoms of the protein have been restrained by a strong harmonic potential of 1 . 66 nN / nm . The electrostatics for the position restraint simulation is calculated using a 1nm Coulomb cutoff . Solvent and protein are separately coupled to external heat baths at 300K with a time constant of 0 . 1ps using Berendsen temperature coupling [ 58 ] . Afterwards , the system is equilibrated without restraints for 100 ns resulting in a stable complex . The equilibration structures every 100 ps are clustered using the gromos clustering method of the Gromacs MD software package [ 59 ] with a RMSD cutoff of 0 . 15 nm . The representative structure of the dominating cluster is used as an initial structure for further simulations . Figure 2A shows the structure of the talin - 2 F3 FERM subdomain ( red ) binding the integrin ! 1D - tail ( green ) resulting from 100 ns free equilibration . The RMSF shown in Figure 3A is determined using g _ rmsf from the Gromacs MD software package . Structure Alignment The fully equilibrated structure is aligned with the integrin TM " IIb - ! 3 - bundle ( 2K9J ) [ 27 ] and the complete talin head domain ( 3IVJ ) [ 30 ] binding the integrin ! 1D - tail . All alignments 110 21 are made to the equilibrated structure using pymol alignment . The resulting model is shown in Figures 2B and 4 . Setup Structures The simulation boxes are generated by resolvating the representative equilibrated structure ( Figure 2B ) in different water boxes for each type of pulling setup . For each box , energy minimization , position restraint and a 200 ps long free equilibration simulation analog to the one previously described are done . Each constant force molecular dynamics simulation is preceded by another 100 ps free equilibration with freshly initiated velocity profiles . Constant Force Molecular Dynamics Simulations Constant forces in the range of 20 pN to 500 pN are simulated . The forces are applied to the integrin’s C - terminal C ! - atom is probed with a constant force either parallel ( P ) or normal ( N ) to the putative plane of the cellular membrane . The plane of the membrane is perpendicular to the connection from integrin’s C - terminal to talin’s N - terminal C ! - atoms . In Figure 1B the force vectors are indicated . The positively charged membrane binding talin residues are indicated in red . To these residues a plane can be fitted which is the approximately parallel to the putative plane of the membrane . To avoid rotations of the talin , all C ! - atoms of the talin complex are restrained with a weak position restrained ( 400 pN / nm ) . Representative Structures For each setup at each force the probability distribution of the integrin - talin COM - COM distances is generated . The extrema of these distributions are determined . All structures with COM - COM distances between to minima are attributed to the peak in between these minima . Their structures are added to one trajectory . Each peak represents a ( semi ) stable intermediate state . For all peaks with at least 8 % population , the representative structure is determined by clustering approximately 1000 equially distributed structures within the trajectory corresponding to the peak . The gromos clustering method is used with a cutoff of 111 22 0 . 3nm and three required nearest neighbors [ 59 ] . From these representative structures the dissociation pathways for normal and parallel forces are determined . Evolutionary Conservation For the determination of the evolutionary conservation of the integrin residues , 27 mammalian integrin beta sequences ( ! 1 , ! 2 , ! 3 , ! 6 , ! 7 ) from the UniProtKB database are aligned to the ! 1D sequence of our structure using ClustalW [ 60 ] . The sequence logo visualization of the conservation is done with weblogo 2 . 8 . 2 [ 61 , 62 ] . 112 23 References 1 .

Molecular rotation is important for many biomolecular machines as well as for synthetic brownian molecular motors . Here we describe molecular dynamics studies of a diethylsulﬁde rotor on a gold ( 111 ) surface driven by a high frequency oscillating electric ﬁeld normal to the surface . This molecular system has been experimentally studied with low temperature scanning / tunneling microscopy ( STM ) exper - iments ( 1 ) . In vacuum , the diethylsulﬁde molecule can exist in either a trans - conﬁguration , or a higher energy cis - conﬁguration . Here , we show that on a three - fold symmetric gold surface both cis and trans forms are split into two distinct conﬁgurations ( trans - 1 and trans - 2 , and cis - 1 and cis - 2 ) that diﬀer by a phase angle in their rotational free - energy proﬁles . A high frequency ( THz ) AC ( alter - nating current ) electric ﬁeld applied normal to the surface drives directed rotation of the trans states of the diethylsulﬁde rotor , with the two conﬁgurations rotating in opposite direction . The maximum directed rotation rate is 10 10 rotations per second , signiﬁcantly faster than the rotation of previously reported directional molecular ro - tors . Understanding the fundamental basis of directed motion of surface rotors is essential for the further development of eﬃcient 1 117 externally driven artiﬁcial rotors . Our results represent a ﬁrst step towards the design of a surface - bound molecular rotary motor with a tunable rotation frequency and direction . 2 118 Control and direction of motion at the molecular level is one of the great overarch - ing themes of nanoscience ( 2 , 3 ) . Captivated by the mechanisms of biological molecular motors and rotors , synthetic chemists have recently made great progress in the design and synthesis of molecular machines , including motors ( 4 ) , steppers ( 5 ) , and rotors ( 6 ) , many of which function as brownian machines ( 7 ) that take advantage of , rather than ﬁght against , ineluctably present thermal noise . Most of these , however , operate only rel - atively slowly , well below the MHz regime . Recently , Garcia - Garibay and colleagues ( 8 ) reported on synthesis and characterization of a halogen bonded crystal with a rotational degree of freedom having a rotation rate in the GHz . The rotation is directionless , with equal probability in the clockwise and counterclockwise directions . A key goal in con - struction of a functional molecular machine is to design a mechanism for inputting energy to drive rapid directed rotation . Chemical driving ( 9 ) suﬀers from diﬀusional limita - tions and seems limited to the 10 - 100 kHz range , consistent with biomolecular machines driven by , e . g . , hydrolysis of ATP . Light ( 10 ) oﬀers another possibility ( 11 ) , but optically driven devices may be limited by the ﬁnite number of excitation / de - excitation cycles a molecule can undergo before breaking down . Here we discuss driving directed rotation with externally applied high frequency electric ﬁelds . Inspired by low temperature single - molecule STM experiments on the rotational dy - namics of thioether surface rotors ( 1 , 12 ) we carried out room temperature ( 300 K ) molec - ular dynamics studies ( 13 , 14 ) of a diethylsulﬁde ( DES ) rotor on a gold ( 111 ) surface under the inﬂuence of a high frequency ( THz ) oscillating electric ﬁeld normal to the gold surface . The AC ﬁeld can drive directed rotation that depends on the conformational state of the molecule and on the frequency and amplitude of the ﬁeld . We interpret the mechanism of the ﬁeld induced directed rotation in terms of the dependence of the energy landscape of the diﬀerent rotor conformations on the static electric ﬁeld strength . Cycling through in 3 119 itself symmetric energy landscapes allows to create a time dependent asymmetry in the population of the rotor angles . The frequency dependence can be well ﬁt by a response function that is the sum of an out - of - phase component at the characteristic frequency of the rotor and an in - phase component at twice the characteristic frequency of the rotor . The THz ﬁeld induces GHz rotation of the molecular rotor making it the fastest rotor ( by far ) described to date . The motion of a diethylsulﬁde ( DES ) rotor on a gold ( 111 ) surface was investigated using molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulations with DFT optimized GolP parameters ( 15 ) . The sulfur was bound in an fcc position to the gold thus forming a stationary rotation axis ( Fig 1A ) . By analyzing the free rotation of the rotor we identiﬁed four major conforma - tions , two trans - and two cis - isomers , by ( Fig 1A ) that can be classiﬁed by two dihedral angles , δ 1 ( C 1 − C 2 − S − C 3 ) and δ 2 ( C 2 − S − C 3 − C 4 ) , along the backbone of the DES molecule ( C 1 H 3 − C 2 H 2 − S − C 3 H 2 − C 4 H 3 ) . The two cis - forms , cis - 1 ( δ 1 < 0 , δ 2 > 0 ) and cis - 2 ( δ 1 > 0 , δ 2 < 0 ) , are inter - converted by rotation about an axis normal to the gold surface . The two trans - isomers are trans - 1 ( δ 1 < 0 , δ 2 < 0 ) and trans - 2 ( δ 1 > 0 , δ 2 > 0 ) cannot be converted into one another by rotation about an axis normal to the gold surface . Simulations of free rotation for several diﬀerent static ﬁeld strength ranging from - 9 V / nm to + 9 V / nm were carried out . The mean lifetimes in the cis and trans states varied signiﬁcantly with the ﬁeld as shown in Table I . These data were calculated by analysis of a number of trajectories with a total time of 0 . 2 ms . In our initial studies of the rotational motion under the inﬂuence of an oscillating ﬁeld we noticed that sometimes the rotor turned clockwise , sometimes counter - clockwise , and sometimes the rotation was not directed at all . Generally the direction of rotation remained the same during an entire trajectory , although we sometimes observed that the direction of rotation would abruptly change . At ﬁrst we ascribed this behavior to 4 120 a residual inertial eﬀect and the switching of the direction to the eﬀects of noise , but this explanation was ruled out by showing that the net rotation in all cases stopped very quickly when the ﬁeld was turned oﬀ . Eventually we were able to correlate the behavior at a given frequency with the conformational state of the molecule . Because of the length of simulation possible with the oscillating ﬁeld ( 5 ns ) the conformation was generally , but not always , constant during simulation of a single trajectory . Due to computational constraints it was not practical to simulate a long enough trajectory that the molecule undergoes many conformational transitions during a single run . Thus we decided to investigate the behavior of the diﬀerent conformational states of the molecule separately where during a single trajectory the dihedral angle of the rotor was restrained to within ± π / 9 radians to prevent transition to a diﬀerent conformational state . This allowed us to focus on the almost 1 - D motion of the rotor around an axis perpendicular to the gold surface piercing the center of the sulfur atom . The equation of motion for a 1 - D surface rotor with noise is I ¨ θ + Γ ˙ θ − U " ( θ ) = ξ ( t ) ( 16 ) . In order to determine the energy landscape U ( θ ) we obtained the long - time averaged “equilibrium” occupancy of the rotor as a function of the torsional angle for the diﬀerent rotor conformations by simulating 11 . 4 ms trajectories with restrained dihedral angles to prevent the switching between diﬀerent conformations . The energy landscapes for rotation are then given by relation k B T ln ρ ( θ ) ∝ U ( θ ) . The landscapes for the two trans - conﬁgurations are six - fold symmetric , with trans - 2 shifted by π / 6 rad relative to the trans - 1 conﬁguration ( Fig . 1B ) , and the landscape for the two cis - conﬁgurations are three - fold symmetric , with cis - 2 shifted by π / 3 degrees relative to cis - 1 ( Fig . 1C ) . The interaction between the rotor and the gold surface is inﬂuenced by a static elec - tric ﬁeld E z perpendicular to the gold surface . The partial charges of the DES rotor are distributed such that the negative partial charge of the sulfur ( δq − = − 0 . 335 e ) is com - 5 121 pensated by the two adjacent methylene groups ( each δq + = + 0 . 1675 e ) , leaving the outer methyl groups uncharged . Figure 1B illustrates that since the sulfur is in the rotational axis bound to the gold , the main contribution of the static electric ﬁeld inﬂuencing the rotation is due to a force on the methylene groups . A negative electric ﬁeld pulls the ethylene away from the gold surface reducing the torsional barriers slightly compared to the ﬁeld free state , while a positive electric ﬁeld presses the methylene groups closer to the gold surface thus increasing the torsional barriers . Additionally , the ﬁeld inﬂuences the position of the minima and maxima of the energy for the trans - states , with the phase varying by approximately π / 60 radians from − 9 V / nm to + 9 V / nm Figs . 2a and 2b . The amplitude of the energy proﬁle depends on the ﬁeld for the cis - states but the phase does not shift . The energy landscape for the trans - states is a simple cosine function U ( θ , E z ) = A ( E z ) cos [ nθ + φ ( E z ) ] ( n = 3 for cis - and n = 6 for trans - states ) at each value of the ﬁeld , where the ﬁeld dependent amplitude is well ﬁt by the relation A ( E z ) = A ( 0 ) ( 1 + aE z + · · · ) and we keep only the ﬁrst correction , with a = . 058 nm / V and with A ( 0 ) = k B T . The phase relative to the zero - ﬁeld case is given by φ ( E z ) = bE z , with b = ± . 146 ( nm / V ) where we take the minus sign for trans - 1 and the plus sign for trans - 2 . An oscillating electric ﬁeld normal to the gold surface leads to a time dependent potential in which both the amplitude A ( E z ( t ) ) and phase φ ( E z ( t ) ) vary in time through the external ﬁeld E z ( t ) = E 0 cos ( ωt ) . In our study the amplitude E 0 ranged from 0 . 75 to 9 V / nm and the oscillation frequency ω ranged from 1 . 5 THz to 7 . 5 THz . Stimulation of the surface rotor by a time dependent ﬁeld gives rise to a very rich and complex set of behaviors of the rotor . Neither of the two cis - states undergo directional rotation at any ﬁeld strength or frequency . The eﬀective rotational diﬀusion rate , however , does depend signiﬁcantly on the ﬁeld parameters . Both trans - 1 and trans - 2 are driven 6 122 to undergo directed rotation in a strongly frequency dependent way . At each frequency the magnitude of the driven rotation is a monotonic function of ﬁeld amplitude up to about 9 V / nm so in this paper we focus on the largest ﬁeld amplitude as we consider the frequency response of the system . The net rotation rate approaches zero in the zero frequency limit . As the frequency is increased to greater than THz the rotor begins to undergo net rotation , ﬁrst one way , and then the next , passing through zero . The rotation rate falls back to near zero at slightly higher frequencies . Then , as the frequency increases further there is a large peak in the net rotational rate . Signiﬁcantly , the frequency at which the maximum of the high frequency peak occurs is precisely twice the frequency at which the net rotation goes through zero in switching between clockwise and counterclockwise rotation at the lower frequency feature . We can gain insight into this complex behavior by numerically solving the deterministic equation of motion , which for our sinusoidally oscillating ﬁeld can be rewritten ¨ θ + τ − 1 ˙ θ + ω 20 [ 1 + aE 0 cos ( ωt ) ] [ sin ( θ + bE 0 cos ( ωt ) ) ] = 0 ( 1 ) There are two relevant characteristic frequencies , the damping frequency τ − 1 = Γ I , and the characteristic librational frequency of the molecule near the minima of the sinusoidal potential ω 0 = 2 π ! A ( 0 ) I / ( π / 3 ) . For small molecular rotors the librational frequency is typically of order 10 13 radians / sec ( 6 ) . Using a moment arm r = 1 nm , reduced mass of 15 amu , and an amplitude A 0 = 4 × 10 − 21 J ≈ k B T , we calculate ω 0 = 2 . 4 THz . Judging by the number of overshoots seen in simulations starting with non - zero initial velocity the damping frequency τ − 1 seems to be a bit less than half the librational frequency . The numerical solution of the deterministic diﬀerential equation ( 1 ) already foreshad - ows many of the features observed in the molecular dynamics simulation of the surface rotor . Most notably , for suﬃciently large stimulation and for suﬃciently small damp - 7 123 ing , when the external frequency approaches twice the characteristic frequency there is a period doubling transition close to ω = 2 ω 0 indicative of parametric resonance . The am - plitude of oscillation in the position builds over several periods of the external ﬁeld , ﬁnally reaching a maximum amplitude . The period doubling is similar to the half synchronous rotation described by Horinek and Michl ( 17 ) although here the amplitude of oscillation - not the rotation rate of the rotor - has twice the period of the external stimulation . Inertia is essential for the parametrically driven oscillation and there is neither period doubling nor increase in amplitude of the oscillation if the damping is too strong . However , in the absence of driving , inertial eﬀects are damped very quickly , within about 4 overshoot periods ( ≈ 10 − 12 s − 1 ) with the parameter values we used , as shown in the inset of Fig . 2D , consistent with what we observed in the MD simulations . The behavior demonstrated by solving the deterministic equation ( 1 ) is not in itself suﬃcient to explain the observed directed rotation - the AC ﬁeld acting alone does not provide suﬃcient energy to over - come the barrier . We propose that the rotation is a noise assisted stochastic pumping process ( 18 ) where the asymmetric oscillation in position leads to a greater chance for thermal activation over the barrier in the clockwise direction than in the counterclockwise direction for the trans - 1 state . To emphasize the diﬀusional character of the motion we calculated the probability density near the top of the barrier in both high ( positive , Fig . 3A ) and low ( negative ) ﬁeld . The net currents can be calculated in terms of the simple diﬀusion at the top of the barrier averaged over a cycle of the ﬁeld . Inspired by the Lorentz model for a bound electron in an oscillating ﬁeld and by the behavior of a parametric oscillator ( 19 ) , we search for a theoretical description of the observed features of the induced net rotation in the simulations by cobbling together a linear out - of - phase response function at the characteristic frequency , and an in - phase 8 124 response function at twice the characteristic frequency , J = J max " τ − 1 ( ω − ω 0 ) 1 + [ 2 τ − 1 ( ω − ω 0 ) ] 2 + 1 1 + [ 2 τ − 1 ( ω − 2 ω 0 ) ] 2 # ( 2 ) Rather amazingly this theory describes the frequency dependence of the net rotation quite well as shown in Fig . 3C . The response at the characteristic frequency arises from a direct driving of the phase ( the equilibrium position in a harmonic approximation , Fig . 2B ) while the response at twice the characteristic frequency arises from parametric modulation of the amplitude ( the spring constant in a harmonic approximation , Fig . 2B ) . The essential symmetry breaking occurs because in the trans - 1 state the amplitude relative to that at zero - ﬁeld is large when the phase is negative relative to that at zero ﬁeld and small when the phase is positive relative to that at zero ﬁeld , and vice versa for trans - 2 . If either a or b is zero in Eq . ( 1 ) the oscillation is perfectly symmetric under all conditions and there can be no directed rotation even though energy is continually fed into the system via the external perturbation . In the linear driving regime the net rotation is the diﬀerence between a large rotation rate in one direction and an even larger rate in the other direction ( Fig . 3E ) . On the other hand , in the parametric driving regime the rotation is almost deterministic , with only very infrequent reverse rotations . At still higher frequency both directed and diﬀusional rotation essentially vanish . We have demonstrated by molecular dynamic simulations that THz applied ﬁelds can be used to drive directed motion , and to control both net rotation and rotational diﬀusion , of a diethylsulﬁde molecule on a gold surface . Near a characteristic frequency ( 2 . 8 THz ) that can be calculated from molecular parameters the rotor can be switched between clockwise and counterclockwise rotational modes by small changes in the frequency of the applied ﬁeld . The frequency of the net rotation is relatively small ( 3 GHz ) , and the 9 125 Peclet number ( the magnitude of the diﬀerence divided by the sum of the clockwise and counterclockwise rates ) is about 0 . 5 . At twice this characteristic frequency ( 5 . 6 THz ) the rotor is parametrically pumped to undergo directional rotation at a larger rate ( 10 GHz ) and the Peclet number approaches unity since there are essentially no backward rotations . A simple deterministic model Eq . ( 1 ) captures qualitatively the observed parametric pumping , but the rotation of the molecule requires thermal noise to provide energy for overcoming the barrier once the large asymmetric oscillation is engendered by the applied ﬁeld . The frequency response is well described by a simple theory for the response function with an out - of - phase component at the characteristic frequency and an in - phase component at twice the characteristic frequency . The maximal stimulated net rotation at 10 GHz is very much faster than any other directional rotor with which we are familiar . Although the high frequency seems more likely to have signiﬁcant technological application , it will be impossible to experimentally access directionality by use of previous mechanisms for sensing directional rotation such as the tunneling current to the surface from an AFM tip . However , the rotating partial charge on the inner methyl groups will cause a magnetic ﬁeld ) B = µ 0 δq + / ( T r ) , where µ 0 is the magnetic permeability , and T is the period of the rotation . For maximal rotation rate of 10 GHz this works out to be greater than 10 mG which should be relatively easily measurable . Conversely , the rotation rate should depend on any magnetic ﬁelds , allowing this rotor to act as a molecular compass ( 20 ) The two distinct trans - states , trans - 1 and trans - 2 , rotate in opposite directions at every frequency and amplitude . With an equal mixture of these two forms on a surface there would be no net rotation . Designing some means of switching the relative stability of the two states would provide a very powerful mechanism for switching the net rotational direction . An interesting possibility is to use a magnetic ﬁeld normal to the gold surface 10 126 in combination with a THz ﬁeld to dynamically favor one state over another , depending on the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld , even under conditions where the two conformers are a priori energetically equivalent . The electric ﬁeld breaks microscopic reversibility ( 21 ) , and the magnetic ﬁeld then breaks “macroscopic reversibility” . A detailed study of the conformational dynamics during stimulation would provide important insight into how to proceed in this direction but such a study will be very computationally intensive . We have described a molecular dynamics simulation of a very fast surface rotor that can be sensitively driven and controlled by an external THz AC electric ﬁeld . We anticipate that this work will provide stimulation for experimental as well as for further theoretical work toward the design of controllable rotors that can be used as components in the design of integrated molecular machines References and Notes 1 .

The GolP force ﬁeld is used ( 23 ) . It is optimized for gold ( 111 ) surface simulations and based on the OPLS - AA force ﬁeld ( 24 ) . The diethylsulﬁd parameters have been DFT optimized for this GolP force ﬁeld by the group of Stephano Corni ( 15 ) . The system is simulated in vaccum with periodic boundary conditions . The gold is 5 atom layers thick with a surface area of 3 . 23 × 3 . 56 nm 2 . The DES is positioned on the surface with the sulfur in an fcc position on the gold 0 . 258 nm away from each of its three neighboring gold atoms ( 25 ) . The position of the sulfur is frozen in space to simulate the sulfur gold bond and to form a stable axis for the stationary rotation on the gold . The gold surface and the DES are both neutrally charged . The partial charge distribution of the DES on the gold can be found in Table 2 . Table 2 : The outer two methyl groups are neutrally charged , while the inner two methylen groups are positively charged , each with half the opposite charge of the central sulfur atom .

A cut - oﬀ radius of 1 . 1 nm is used for Coulomb interactions and 1 . 0 nm for van - der - Waals interactions . This energy minimized structure is used as starting 20 136 structure for ﬁeld free simulations . All simulations are done at 300K . For all further simulations electrostatics are calcu - lated with Fast Particle - Mesh Ewald electrostatics ( PME ) ( 26 ) with an order of four and a cutoﬀ for coulomb and van - der - Waals interactions of 1 . 0 nm . Temperature coupling is done by a velocity rescaling thermostat ( 27 ) coupled to the whole system . Angle Deﬁnition The rotation angle α is calculated using the vector v connecting the two inner C α atoms by α = arctan ( v x v y ) − sign ( v y ) ∗ 90 ◦ + n cyc × 360 ◦ with n cyc being the number of full rotations . Relative Energies The free energies are calculated from the population of the angles α by δE ( α ) = − k B T × ln ( N ( α ) N min ) − min ( E ( α ) ) , with the rotation angle α ( from 0 ◦ to 120 ◦ ) , the number of timesteps N ( α ) in which the angle is populated and the minimum population count of all angles N min . Initial Structures for free rotation For further simulations including an electric ﬁeld , a set of 10 structures have been chosen from the ﬁnal structures of the free rotation simulations with 200ns simulation each , allto - gether representing a sample of diﬀerent rotation angles α to increase sampling especially at high ﬁelds . A new starting velocity distribution is generated for each new simulation . Initial Structures for restrained simulations For the restrained simulations , the structures of a 200ns long undisturbed rotation tra - jectory are clustered . The six prominent clusters ( every 60 ◦ ) of each trans conformation 21 137 are chosen as initial structures . In addition two prominent clusters for each cis state are simulated . Restrained simulations The dihedral angle restraints allows a free development of the system in a range of ± 20 ◦ around the energy minimum of the dihedral angle distributions . Thus , the rotor could freely explore its energy landscape in the restraint conformation preventing switching to unwanted conformations . External Electric Field An external electric ﬁeld is applied perpendicular to the gold surface in z - direction . The electrical ﬁeld is positive if it points from the rotor to the surface ( Fig . 1B ) . The electric ﬁeld strength ranges from - 9 to + 9 V / nm . The simulation time is 2ns per trajectory . In the highest ﬁeld regimes the partial charge distribution of the molecular rotor might be subject to additional polarization eﬀects , not taken into account by the DFT derived partial charge distribution . External Oscillating Electric Field We apply an oscillating ﬁeld E ( t ) = E 0 × cos ( ωt ) × ˆ e z perpendicular to the gold surface with ˆ e z pointing from the rotor to the gold surface . The strength of the oscillating ﬁeld E 0 ranges from 0 . 75 to 9 Vnm , while the oscillation frequency of the electric ﬁeld ω ranges from 1 . 5 to 7 . 5 THz . Lower oscillation frequencies interpolated the behavior of the rotor between zero ﬁeld and 1 . 5 THz driving , showing 22 138 no additional features . Higher frequencies strongly arrest the rotor on the surface and no further rotation is observed . 23 139 References 1 . Christof B Mast and Dieter Braun . Thermal trap for dna replication .
