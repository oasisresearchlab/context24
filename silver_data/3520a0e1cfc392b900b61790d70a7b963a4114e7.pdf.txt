J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 2 A B S T R A C T Background : COVID - 19 is arguably the most important public health concern in 2020 worldwide , and efforts are now escalating to suppress or eliminate its spread . Objective : In this study , we undertook a meta - analysis to estimate the global and regional SARS - CoV - 2 seroprevalence rates in humans , and to assess whether seroprevalence associates with geographical , climatic and socio - demographic factors . Data sources : We systematically reviewed PubMed , Scopus , Embase , medRxiv and bioRxiv databases for preprints or peer - reviewed articles ( up to 14 August 2020 ) . Study eligibility criteria : Population - based studies describing the prevalence of anti - SARS - CoV - 2 ( IgG and / or IgM ) serum antibodies . Participants : People of different socio - economic and ethnic backgrounds – from the general population – whose prior COVID - 19 status was unknown were tested for the presence of anti - SARS - CoV - 2 serum antibodies . Interventions : There were no interventions . Methods : We used a random - e ﬀ ects model to estimate pooled seroprevalence , and then extrapolated the findings to the global population ( for 2020 ) . Subgroup and meta - regression analyses explored potential sources of heterogeneity in the data , and relationships between seroprevalence and socio - demographic , geographical and / or climatic factors . Results : In total , 47 studies involving 399 , 265 people from 23 countries met the inclusion criteria . Heterogeneity ( I 2 = 99 . 4 % , P < 0 . 001 ) was seen among studies ; the SARS - CoV - 2 seroprevalence in the general population varied from 0 . 37 % to 22 . 1 % , with a pooled estimate of 3 . 38 % ( 95 % CI , 3 . 05 % – 3 . 72 % ; 15 , 879 / 399 , 265 ) . On a regional level , seroprevalence varied from 1 . 45 % ( 0 . 95 – 1 . 94 % ; South America ) to 5 . 27 % ( 3 . 97 – 6 . 57 % ; Northern Europe , although some variation appeared to relate to the serological assay used . The findings suggested an association of seroprevalence with income levels , human development indices , geographical latitudes and / or climate . Extrapolating to the 2020 world population , we estimated that 263 . 5 million individuals had been exposed or infected at the time of this study . Conclusion : This study showed that SARS - CoV - 2 seroprevalence varied markedly among geographic regions , as might be expected early in a pandemic . Longitudinal surveys to continually monitor seroprevalence around the globe will be critical to support prevention and control efforts , and might indicate levels of endemic stability or instability in particular countries and regions . A . Rostami , Clin Microbiol Infect 2020 Keywords : SARS - CoV - 2 / COVID - 19 Global seroprevalence Serum antibodies ( IgG and / or IgM ) General population Meta - analysis Subgroup analyses J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 3 Introduction COVID - 19 – a severe , acute respiratory syndrome caused by the coronavirus SARS - CoV - 2 – was first identified in Wuhan , China in December 2019 [ 1 , 2 ] , and spread within months to most nations of the world [ 3 ] . By 16 August 2020 , this pandemic disease was affecting people in 213 countries and territories , with ~ 21 million confirmed cases and ~ 800 , 000 deaths reported globally [ 4 ] . The diagnosis and management of COVID - 19 is based on the detection of SARS - CoV - 2 in nasopharyngeal swabs from patients presenting with clinical signs ( including fever , dry cough and / or shortness of breath ) , or in suspected cases , by reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction ( RT – PCR ) [ 5 , 6 ] . Since the manifestation of SARS - CoV - 2 infection ranges from asymptomatic to fatal , the surveillance of confirmed COVID - 19 cases might not be representative for a particular community [ 7 , 8 ] . Although RT - PCR is presently recognized as a “gold standard” for the diagnosis of SARS - CoV - 2 infection [ 5 ] , a significant number of asymptomatic or subclinical , infected individuals is likely to remain undetected . Therefore , it is plausible or likely that the actual number of people exposed to , or infected with , is underestimated [ 7 - 9 ] . Serological screening represents a critical adjunct to PCR - based detection / diagnosis and is a key tool to evaluate the cumulative prevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 infection , and to monitor seroconversion [ 10 ] and seroreversion [ 11 , 12 ] in individuals and a community , to gain insight into the dynamics of specific antibody responses during and after the spread of the virus and , if undertaken routinely , to inform health authorities , politicians and policy makers about seroprevalence at any given stage during an epidemic [ 13 , 14 ] . The prevalence of specific serum antibodies ( IgG and / or IgM ) against SARS - CoV - 2 can provide a sound indication of exposure to SARS - CoV - 2 in a population [ 7 , 9 ] . Due to an apparent persistence of antibodies to SARS - CoV - 2 ( particularly IgG ) after viral clearance [ 7 ] , it is expected that serological monitoring and surveillance provide relevant data sets to estimate the cumulative prevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 infection / exposure in a population [ 7 , 15 ] , and may even indicate the immune status of individuals or populations [ 8 , 9 ] . Several commercial and in - house immunoassays are being used for the detection of IgG and / or IgM serum antibodies to SARS - CoV - 2 ; these are mainly enzyme - linked immunosorbent assays ( ELISAs ) , chemiluminescence immunoassays ( CLIAs ) or lateral flow assays ( LFIAs ) [ 16 , 17 ] . The diagnostic specificity and sensitivity of these methods vary , and depend on the use of recombinant or purified protein antigens ( e . g . , spike ( S ) , envelope ( E ) , membrane ( M ) , nucleocapsid ( N ) or receptor binding domain ( RBD ) proteins ) , and the rigor of assay optimization [ 18 , 19 ] . Since April 2020 , sero - epidemiological studies have been reported from a number of countries most affected by COVID - 19 , including Brazil , China , France , Germany , Iran , Italy , Spain , England and the USA [ 9 , 20 - 27 ] . As the pandemic spreads , it is crucial that a rapid and thorough analysis be undertaken to estimate global seroprevalence at a moment in time . In this study , six months after the commencement of the pandemic , we undertook a meta - analysis to estimate the global and regional seroprevalences of SARS - CoV - 2 in people of the general population ( whose prior COVID - 19 status was unknown ) , and assessed whether geographical , climatic and socio - demographic factors impact on seroprevalence . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 4 Methods Search strategy and selection criteria This study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta - Analyses ( PRISMA ) guidelines ( cf . Fig . 1 ) . We performed a systematic literature search in the databases PubMed , Scopus , Embase , medRxiv and bioRxiv in August , 2020 using the following terms : “SARS - CoV - 2” , “COVID - 19” , “coronavirus” , “antibody” , “ELISA” , “seroprevalence” and “population” , without language or geographical restriction ( Fig . S1 ) . Additional related articles were retrieved from Google Scholar and manually . All articles were imported to Endnote software X8 ( Thompson and Reuters , Philadelphia , USA ) , and duplicates removed . Two independent reviewers ( A . R . , M . S . ) studied all titles and abstracts for eligibility . Included were all peer - reviewed population - based studies , preprints , and research reports which reported the prevalence of anti - SARS - CoV - 2 serum antibodies in the ‘general population’ ( i . e . randomly - selected people of different ages , occupations , educational and ethnic backgrounds , socioeconomic status , living in a defined geographical region , whose prior COVID - 19 status was unknown ) . Articles were excluded if they ( 1 ) involved suspected , confirmed or hospitalised COVID - 19 patients ; ( 2 ) were performed in at - risk population ( e . g . , health - care workers ) or individuals with known diseases ( e . g . , cancer or dialysis patients ) ; ( 3 ) recorded prevalence based on clinical manifestation , computed tomography scan or PCR ; ( 4 ) were comparative studies of diagnostic methods ; ( 5 ) used data sets that overlapped with those of other articles ; ( 6 ) were case reports or case studies ; or ( 7 ) were editorials , commentaries , reviews or systematic reviews . Extraction of data and quality evaluation After the screening of published articles for eligibility , relevant data and information from each eligible study were entered into a specific form in Microsoft Excel ( version 2016 ; Microsoft Corporation , Redmond , USA ) . Two co - authors ( A . R . and M . N . S ) independently collated data from all eligible studies , and two ( M . S . and S . E . ) independently evaluated these data . Any inconsistencies were discussed and consensus decision made . The following items were obtained from each study ( if described ) : primary author ; publication year ; country ; city ; study design and period ; type of serological methods used ; sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic methods ; number of people screened ; the number of people sero - positive for SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies , and data regarding to age , sex and ethnicity . All geographical areas ( i . e . cities and countries ) investigated were classified according to ‘Sustainable Development Goal’ ( SDG ) - regions or sub - regions defined by the United Nations [ 28 ] . For individual countries , we recorded information on the total numbers of confirmed cases and deaths ( up to 15 August 2020 ) reported by World Health Organization ( WHO ) [ 29 ] , World Bank’s income category [ 30 ] , gross national income per capita [ 31 ] and the human development index [ HDI ] [ 32 ] . Furthermore , we recorded total global , regional and national populations ( both sexes combined ) in 2020 , estimated by the United Nations [ 33 ] . If sample size ( s ) and the numbers of sero - positive people were specified in studies , we extracted and critically appraised data for separate geographic regions . We also recorded latitude , longitude , mean relative humidity , and mean environmental temperature in geographic regions / sub - regions during the study period using the database timeanddate . com ( weblink : https : / / www . timeanddate . com ) . The quality of studies included in the meta - analysis was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute ( JBI ) Prevalence Critical Appraisal Tool [ 34 ] . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 5 Individual articles were assessed as to whether they adequately described : sample collection , recruitment method , subjects and the setting , number of subjects , information on subjects , results , reliability of results , statistical analysis method ( s ) , subpopulation analysis and confounder adjustment ( “yes” or “no” answer ) . For each study , the number of “yes” answers to these 10 criteria was counted ; the higher the number of “yes” answers , the lower the risk of bias in a study . Meta - analysis All analyses were carried out using Stata statistical software ( v . 13 Stata Corp . , College Station , TX , USA ) . To conservatively estimate the pooled seroprevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 in the general population , we used a DerSimonian and Laird random - effects model ( REM ) [ 35 ] . For this purpose , first , we estimated the seroprevalence in individual countries by synthesizing the seroprevalence rates of all studies from the same country , and then calculated the seroprevalences of SARS - CoV - 2 for the WHO - defined - regions ( if studies were available for at least two countries ) by synthesizing the data for countries within the same SDG - region . We calculated the pooled seroprevalence rates at a 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) using the ‘metaprop’ command in Stata software . We estimated heterogeneity using the I 2 statistic , and an I 2 of > 75 % and a p < 0 . 05 were considered to represent substantial heterogeneity [ 36 ] . To estimate the number of people exposed to SARS - CoV - 2 , we extrapolated seroprevalence estimates to the total human population ( in 2020 ) living in a country and a region – according to the UN Population Division [ 28 ] . To explore possible sources of heterogeneity and also effects of socio - demographic , geographical and climatic parameters on SARS - CoV - 2 seroprevalence , we undertook several subgroup analyses by REM as well as random effects meta - regression ecological analyses using the ‘metareg’ command in STATA [ 37 ] . These analyses were performed considering SDG - regions ; serological method used ; age , sex and ethnicity of people ; country income level , country HDI ; latitude , longitude ; mean environmental temperature ; mean relative humidity ; and time during the pandemic . To assess the effect of these variables on seroprevalence , we carried out random effects meta - regression analyses using the ‘metareg’ command in STATA [ 37 ] . Further meta - regression analyses were performed to assess whether seroprevalence was associated with the total number of confirmed cases or deaths in individual countries . As publication bias is not relevant for prevalence studies [ 38 ] , it was not assessed . Results were considered as statistically significant if the P value was < 0 . 1 . Results Study characteristics Our search of electronic databases identified a total of 4 , 912 articles ; following the removal of duplicate articles and a critical appraisal of article titles and abstracts , 133 potentially relevant articles were identified for full - text evaluation ( Fig . 1 ) . After applying the eligibility criteria , 47 articles were included in the quantitative synthesis ; these 47 eligible articles contained 107 data sets representing 399 , 265 people from 23 countries in six SDG - regions . Of these data sets , 74 were from Europe and Northern America , 17 from Latin America and the Caribbean , 13 from Eastern and South - eastern Asia , one from Central and Southern Asia , one from North Africa and Western Asia , and one from Sub - Saharan Africa . We did not identify a published study from Oceania . Information on the studies included is provided in Table S1 . Most articles included ( 44 studies ) had a low risk of bias ( score : 7 - 10 / 10 ) , and only three studies had a moderate risk ( 6 / 10 ) of bias ( Table 2 ) . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 6 SARS - CoV - 2 seroprevalence Analysis of the 107 data sets selected from the 47 articles showed that 15 , 879 people from a general population of 399 , 265 had specific serum antibodies to SARS - CoV - 2 , indicating a pooled seroprevalence of 3 . 38 % ( 95 % CI , 3 . 05 % – 3 . 72 % ) . Significant heterogeneity ( I 2 = 99 . 4 % , P < 0 . 001 ) was seen among studies . An extrapolation to a global population ( 2020 ) indicated that ~ 263 . 5 million ( range : 237 , 741 , 369 to 289 , 966 , 523 ) people had been exposed to SARS - CoV - 2 ( 14 July 2020 ) . More detail on the overall and regional SARS - CoV - 2 seroprevalences and burdens is given in Table 1 . According to SDG - subregions ( for which ≥ 2 countries were represented ) , seroprevalences were : 5 . 27 % ( 3 . 97 – 6 . 57 % ) in Northern Europe ; 4 . 41 % ( 2 . 20 – 6 . 61 % ) in Southern Europe ; 4 . 41 % ( 3 . 03 – 5 . 79 % ) in Northern America ; 3 . 17 % ( 1 . 96 – 4 . 38 % ) in Western Europe ; 2 . 02 % ( 1 . 56 – 2 . 49 % ) in Eastern Asia ; and 1 . 45 % ( 0 . 95 – 1 . 94 % ) in South America . Countries with the highest seroprevalences were Iran ( 22 . 1 % ) , Sweden ( 15 . 02 ) , Chile ( 10 . 7 % ) , Switzerland ( 7 . 9 % ) , Italy ( 7 . 27 % ) , South - Korea ( 7 . 5 % ) , Spain ( 5 . 0 % ) and USA ( 4 . 4 % ) . Fig . 2 shows the SARS - CoV - 2 seroprevalence estimates for individual countries . Seroprevalence according to sex , age and population Of the 47 studies included , 29 reported separate , pooled seroprevalences for males and females . Of 145 , 368 males and 151 , 790 females , 6 , 186 males ( 5 . 33 % , 4 . 35 – 6 . 31 % ) and 6 , 958 females ( 5 . 05 % , 4 . 06 – 6 . 04 ) had specific serum antibodies against SARS - CoV - 2 . Fifteen studies reported pooled seroprevalences for different age groups ; subgroup analyses revealed pooled seroprevalences of 2 . 28 % ( 1 . 01 – 3 . 56 % ) , 3 . 22 % ( 1 . 90 – 4 . 55 % ) , 2 . 98 % ( 1 . 59 – 4 . 36 % ) and 2 . 57 % ( 1 . 39 – 3 . 76 % ) in people of ≤ 19 , 20 - 49 , 50 - 64 and ≥ 65 years of age , respectively ( Table 2 ) . Of the 47 studies , 36 tested people of all age groups , whereas nine , and two studies tested only adults and children , respectively ( Table 2 ) . Subgroup analysis revealed pooled seroprevalences of 2 . 43 % ( 2 . 16 – 2 . 70 % ) in people of all ages , 5 . 31 % ( 4 . 12 – 6 . 50 % ) in adults only , and 8 . 76 % ( 7 . 46 – 10 . 06 % ) in children only ( Table 2 ) . Seroprevalence in relation to serological assay used Of 47 studies , 18 studies utilised rapid LFIAs to detect specific serum antibodies against SARS - CoV - 2 , 11 used ELISA , 13 used CLIAs , four studies employed a virus neutralisation assay , and one used a microsphere immunoassay . Thirty - seven studies used commercial kits and 10 employed in - house serological methods . Subgroup analyses , conducted considering the type of serological method employed , revealed pooled seroprevalences of 3 . 95 % ( 3 . 17 – 4 . 74 % ) , 3 . 53 % ( 2 . 65 – 4 . 40 % ) , 2 . 73 % ( 2 . 03 – 3 . 42 % ) and 1 . 32 % ( 0 . 90 – 1 . 74 % ) using LFIA , ELISA , CLIA and neutralisation assays , respectively . One study in the USA , which used a microsphere immunoassay , indicated a seroprevalence of 12 . 5 % ( 11 . 97 - 13 . 03 % ) . Subgroup analysis revealed pooled seroprevalence rates of 3 . 33 % ( 2 . 95 – 3 . 71 % ) using commercial and 3 . 63 % ( 2 . 79 – 4 . 48 % ) employing in - house assays ( Table 2 ) . Seroprevalence in relation to ethnicity J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 7 Seven studies ( five from the USA , one from England and one from Brazil ) had data sets that were stratified according to ethnicity . Subgroup analysis revealed pooled seroprevalences of 3 . 76 % ( 1 . 43 – 6 . 08 % ) , 9 . 96 % ( 2 . 95 – 16 . 97 % ) , 8 . 76 % ( 0 . 01 – 18 . 65 % ) and 5 . 78 % ( 1 . 76 – 9 . 79 % ) in white , black , Hispanic and other ethnic backgrounds ( Asian / other ) , respectively ( Table 2 ) . In the USA , subgroup analysis revealed pooled seroprevalences of 4 . 11 % ( 1 . 45 – 6 . 78 % ) , 10 . 83 % ( 4 . 81 – 16 . 85 % ) , 12 . 79 % ( 2 . 33 – 27 . 91 % ) and 5 . 86 % ( 1 . 12 – 10 . 60 % ) in white / non - Hispanic , black / non - Hispanic , Hispanic and other backgrounds ( Asian / other ) , respectively . Relationship between seroprevalence and socio - demographic variables Thirty - five studies represented countries with high income and very high HDI levels ; 11 represented countries with upper - middle income levels and high HDIs ; and one country had lower - middle income and medium HDI levels . No study was from a low income or low HDI country . Subgroup analysis ( Table 3 ) , according to income and HDI level , revealed higher seroprevalences in countries with high income ( 4 . 44 % , 3 . 77 – 5 . 1 % ) and very high HDI levels ( 4 . 37 % , 3 . 71 – 5 . 02 % ) than in countries with upper - middle income ( 1 . 31 % , 1 . 02 – 1 . 59 % ) and high HDI levels ( 1 . 35 % , 1 . 06 – 1 . 64 % ) . Random - effects meta - regression analyses showed a significant , increased trend in seroprevalence with higher income ( coefficient [ C ] = 3 . 10e - 07 ; P - value = 0 . 09 ) and HDI ( C = 0 . 131 ; P - value = 0 . 01 ) levels ( Fig . 3A - B ) . Relationship between seroprevalence and geographical location , climate or time At geographical latitudes of 0 – 20° , 20 - 40° and 40 - 60° , seroprevalences were 2 . 99 % ( 0 . 71 – 5 . 28 % ) , 2 . 29 % ( 2 . 03 – 2 . 56 % ) and 4 . 68 % ( 3 . 92 – 5 . 43 % ) , respectively ; the highest and lowest seroprevalences were at longitudes 60 – 90° ( 6 . 36 % , 3 . 07 – 9 . 66 % ) and ≥ 120° ( 1 . 63 % , 1 . 01 – 2 . 25 % ) . In relation to climate , seroprevalences were 5 . 48 % ( 3 . 81 – 7 . 87 % ) , 3 . 41 % ( 2 . 96 – 3 . 85 % ) and 2 . 77 % ( 2 . 01 – 3 . 55 % ) in regions with mean relative humidities of < 60 % , 60 - 80 % , and > 80 % , respectively . Subgroup analysis indicated that the highest and lowest seroprevalence rates occurred in climes with average environmental temperatures of < 7°C ( 7 . 87 % , 1 . 54 – 14 . 20 % ) and 19 - 25°C ( 0 . 85 % , 0 . 60 – 1 . 11 % ) , respectively ( Table 3 ) . There was a significant ( coefficient [ C ] = 0 . 0007 ; P - value = 0 . 03 ) , increasing trend in seroprevalence with increasing geographical latitude ( Fig . 3C ) , and a non - significant ( C = - 0 . 00008 ; P - value = 0 . 316 ) , decreasing trend with geographical longitude ( Fig . S2A ) . Furthermore , there was a significant ( C = - 0 . 0017 ; P - value = 0 . 02 ) , decreasing seroprevalence trend with increasing , average environmental temperature ( Fig . 3D ) and a non - significant ( C = - 0 . 0006 , P - value = 0 . 12 ) , decreasing trend with increasing relative humidity ( Fig . S2B ) . Another subgroup analysis was conducted to explore SARS - CoV - 2 seroprevalence over time – from the start of the pandemic to the time of sampling / testing in individual studies . The results indicated that seroprevalence in a country was lowest at the beginning of a COVID - 19 epidemic , higher at 70 days , and highest 4 months after the start of such an epidemic ( P - value ˂ 0 . 001 ; Table 3 ) . Random - effects meta - regression analysis showed a significant , increasing trend in seroprevalence over time ( C = 0 . 002 ; P - value = 0 . 02 ; Fig . 4 ) . Association between seroprevalence and confirmed COVID - 19 cases ( i . e . disease ) and death Meta - regression analyses revealed a non - significant , increasing trend in the number of confirmed cases ( C = 0 . 0002 ; P - value = 0 . 921 ) and of deaths ( C = 0 . 0001 ; P - value = 0 . 640 ) with increasing seroprevalences ( Fig . S3A - B ) . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 8 Discussion Currently , COVID - 19 is the number - one public health concern worldwide . Here we provide a comprehensive appraisal of SARS - CoV - 2 seroprevalence in the ‘general’ human population from continents from which peer - reviewed investigations had been published ( up to 14 August 2020 ) , and excluding studies of high risk patient groups to avoid a overestimation of seroprevalence . The meta - analysis revealed a pooled SARS - CoV - 2 seroprevalence of 3 . 38 % ( 95 % CI , 3 . 05 % – 3 . 72 % ) relating to ~ 264 million individuals worldwide at the time of drafting this manuscript . Our findings are in accord with the World Health Organization ( WHO ) report prediction that 2 – 3 % of the global population might have been infected by the end of the first epidemic wave [ 39 ] . Thus , our findings suggested ( at the time of this study ) that ~ 97 % of the world’s population was susceptible to SARS - CoV - 2 and COVID - 19 . Overall seroprevalence varied markedly among countries and regions , which may be attributable to many factors , including chance variation , cultural practices , political decision - making , policies , mitigation efforts , health infrastructure and prevention / control measures and / or the effectiveness of the implementation of such measures [ 40 , 41 ] . Subgroup analysis suggested higher seroprevalences rates in countries with higher income levels and HDIs . Due to a lack of data for many disadvantaged countries , findings need to be interpreted with caution , but possible explanations might include increased urbanisation and population density , higher levels of social interaction and intensity of international travel . Morever , our analysis did not extend to a time when COVID - 19 will accelerate in the Southern Hemisphere , especially in Africa and South America , or in South Asia . Due to variability in the data and the lack of detailed reporting , the present findings should be interpreted with some caution . We did see a lower seroprevalence in white people compared with other ethnic minority groups , which is in accord with previous studies [ 42 - 45 ] reporting that minority groups are being disproportionately impacted by COVID - 19 . According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) [ 46 ] , factors suggested to contribute to this disproportionate impact include discrimination in health care , housing , education and finances ; communication and language barriers ; cultural differences between patients and health care providers ; lack of health insurance ; increased employment of ethnic minority groups in essential work settings such as healthcare facilities , farms , factories , grocery stores , and public transportation ; and living in more crowded families or conditions . In this analysis , we did not attempt to distinguish prevalence rates within different regions of the USA or other nations . Doing so might have revealed increased seroprevalence in lower income areas due to the factors mentioned above . Indeed , it was noted that the “blue marble health” concept of poverty - related diseases amongst the poor living in high income nations might apply to COVID - 19 , just as it does for neglected tropical diseases , tuberculosis and other poverty - related conditions [ 47 , 48 ] . Regarding the serological tests , our analysis indicated some variation in diagnostic sensitivity ( detecting IgG and / or IgM ) among the serological assays used in published studies . A recent investigation indicated sensitivity and specificity of 85 % and 99 % for both antibody isotypes [ 49 ] . This review showed that similar seroprevalences were established by ELISA ( 3 . 9 % ) and LFIA ( 3 . 5 % ) , while lower seroprevalence rates were obtained using CLIA ( 2 . 7 % ) and virus neutralisation ( 1 . 3 % ) assays . Two recent meta - analyses [ 50 , 51 ] showed that sensitivities were consistently lower for the LFIA ( 66 - 80 % ) assay compared with ELISA ( 84 - J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 9 93 % ) and CLIA ( 90 - 97 % ) , while a specificity of > 95 % was calculated for all methods . Variation in sensitivity could be attributable to differences in the antigens used ( i . e . recombinant or purified protein ) , the antibody conjugate employed and cut - off set for an assay [ 50 , 52 ] . A Cochrane review indicated that the combination of the detection of IgG and IgM achieved a sensitivity of 30 . 1 % one to 7 days , 72 . 2 % for 8 to 14 days , 91 . 4 % for 15 to 21 days after the onset of symptoms [ 53 ] . In present study [ 22 , 25 , 54 , 55 ] , four studies used virus neutralisation to detect serum antibodies to SARS - CoV - 2 , all exhibiting a sensitivity and specificity of > 98 % . Neutralisation assays are more time consuming to perform ( 3 – 5 days ) and are carried out in Biosafety Level - 3 ( BSL - 3 ) laboratories [ 56 ] ; therefore , these assays might be less suited for routine use . One study [ 57 ] used a microsphere immunoassay to detect serum antibodies to SARS - CoV - 2 and indicated a high seroprevalence ( 12 . 5 % ) . Although this method has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) , results might be interpreted with caution , given that only one study has been published to date . The present analyses indicated an increasing trend for seroprevalence at higher latitudes and lower mean environmental temperatures and relative humidities . This trend seems consistent with some previous laboratory , epidemiological and mathematical modelling studies [ 58 - 61 ] , showing that environmental temperature and humidity play key roles in the survival and transmission of seasonal respiratory viruses . The highest seroprevalences were estimated for latitudes between 40°N and 56°N , in accordance with a previous study [ 61 ] , indicating a substantial community - spread of SARS - CoV - 2 up to March 2020 in areas located in a narrow band in the 30° N and 50° N “corridor” . The finding of higher seroprevalence rates in areas with a low mean relative humidity and temperature accords with recent epidemiological [ 61 ] and laboratory [ 62 ] studies of coronavirus survival . Both temperature and humidity are known as critical factors determining survival and community - transmission of SARS - CoV , MERS - CoV and influenza [ 61 , 63 , 64 ] . Processes or mechanisms proposed to be linked to cold temperatures and low humidity include airborne droplet - stabilisation , increased viral replication in the nasopharyngeal mucosa or respiratory epithelium and / or reduced local innate immune responses , as evidenced for other respiratory viruses [ 58 , 61 , 65 - 67 ] . However , much more research is needed to explore these proposals , and the effects of geographical locations and / or climate factors on SARS - CoV - 2 seroprevalence and COVID - 19 prevalence . As the present study represents a first “snap shot” of SARS - CoV - 2 seroprevalence based on a critical evaluation of published information , it has a number of limitations : First , there is a lack of peer - reviewed , population - based studies from many countries across the globe at an early phase of the pandemic , and some studies included here lacked data on sex and age of subjects tested . We hope that these limitations can be addressed over the next months and years , so that longitudinal investigations provide future estimates that will be more representative of the situation worldwide , and so that , eventually , conclusions might be drawn regarding endemic stability and instability in particular countries and regions . Second , different serological methods / assays ( with varying sensitivities and specificities ) were employed in different studies , which will have some effect on our global estimate , although subgroup analyses were undertaken to assess a potential effect of the serological methods used . Third , pooled analyses showed significant heterogeneity . As such heterogeneity was expected in meta - analyses of global prevalence estimates [ 68 - 70 ] , we explored possible sources of heterogeneity , including geographic region and diagnostic methods . However , we did not find the source of this heterogeneity . This study reinforces the major global health threat of SARS - CoV - 2 infection and its very rapid spread , with the global seroprevalence rising to 3 . 38 % only months after the commencement of the pandemic . This prevalance suggest , though , that ~ 96 % of the world’s J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 10 population are still susceptible to infection , which is alarming . This means that many countries could still face multiple surges in cases and , hence , overwhelm medical systems . We have seen in many locations that hospital beds , intensive care units ( ICUs ) and ventilators reached capacity . For instance , early on , in New York city , the USA had to send mercy ships to handle the surge in need . Therefore , countries should have plans and medical resources in place for future , unexpected waves of COVID - 19 . There are indications from some countries that mortality rates for COVID - 19 are higher than those officially reported [ 71 - 73 ] . Hence , until a vaccine ( s ) is ( are ) available , the focus needs to be on education and prevention and strict quarantine measures . Indeed , universal masks and safe distance are our only means of reducing exposure , infections , disease and deaths . A global meta - analysis [ 74 ] showed that applying physical distancing of ≥ 1 m , usage of personal protective equipment ( PPE , including face mask , eye and body protection ) results in a major reduction in transmission / infection risk . However , the lack of preparedness in many countries to control a rapid - spreading , high virulent and pathogenic virus , combined with limited or no biosecurity strategies / policies on how to deal with pandemics in populations , meant that such simple measures were not introduced initially . Our study calls for routine surveys to monitor temporal changes in seroprevalence in a location . In the context of epidemics and pandemics , such surveys might be conducted on a monthly or two - weekly basis to allow authorities to assess the spread of the virus and exposure levels in populations . A global plan is required to monitor SARS - CoV - 2 seroprevalence to assist prevention and control efforts . We aim to continue to follow the global seroprevalence situation over time , and to report on trends and changes . Transparency declaration The authors declare no conflict of interest .
