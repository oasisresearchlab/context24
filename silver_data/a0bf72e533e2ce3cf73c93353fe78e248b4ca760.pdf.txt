It is fundamental to research how this technology is impacting society and what con - siderations should be taken when designing drones . To support research within Human - Drone Interaction ( HDI ) I present an au - toethnographic study as a first step towards a research through design ( RtD ) approach : putting emphasis on detailed and evocative qualitative data to support work on small provocative RtD probes NordiCHI ’22 , October 8 – 12 , 2022 , Aarhus , Denmark Mafalda Gamboa [ 17 ] . To inform the design , I have been conducting a year - long longitudinal study at home , with my own children ( aged 6 and 3 ) and four commercially available robots , one of them being a drone . While the focus of this paper is drones , the combination of different robots aimed at supporting a variety of perspectives , and finding po - tential common or divergent characteristics between flying robots and other types of domestic robots . The study contributes with a description of experienced qualities of flying robots in a natural domestic setting . Figure 2 : An image of the three indoor robots : Doc , the humanoid robot ; Tello with feathers ( the drone ) ; and Purrble , the stuffed animal robot . Elsa’s and Anna’s hands can be seen for scale . This article is grounded on my own first - person knowledge as part of the system being studied , conducted as an autoethnogra - phy . In order to structure and facilitate the systematisation the knowledge acquired through the autoethnographic method , I have combined it with a Sociotechnical Systems ( StS ) approach . I define and describe my family as a micro - sociotechnical system ( micro - StS ) supported by an existing StS framework . The novel combination between the method and the StS perspective aims to be translated into an experimental system approach to design research [ 7 ] . The combination of methods resulted in valuable and intimate insights which might have been otherwise missed , aiming to under - stand aspects of the incorporation of ( potentially disruptive ) robots into everyday family life , and what implications they bring . What are the expectations of a grandparent who buys a toy drone for their grandchild ? What is the impact such technologies have within a family ? While policy - making and regulations are important , and should be informed by research within HDI , this autoethnographic approach instead puts emphasis on unpacking some of the values and qualities materialised into the design drones [ 47 ] for children from a micro - ethics perspective [ 42 ] . Through this study , I have found how my home was impacted in this manner and witnessed unexpected changes in the relationships between family members . 2 BACKGROUND In this section I give insight into the theoretical and methodolog - ical background of this work , starting with a departure from an epistemological description of Third - Wave HCI . This is followed by the suggested role of autoethnography as an essential part of the designerly work within Research through Design ( RtD ) , and finally a novel combination between Sociotechnical Systems perspective and autoethnography to facilitate sense - making and analysis as well as a description of the family as a micro - StS . This combination is framed by two research questions : “What is the contribution of an auto - ethnographic study , supported by Sociotechnical Systems , in formulating design considerations for Research through Design ? ” and “What is the impact of incorporating toy drones in a domestic environment with small children ? ” . 2 . 1 Situated Perspectives The present research is placed within the third wave of HCI [ 3 , 18 , 27 ] , which is informed by many perspectives grounded on un - derstanding interaction as phenomenologically situated . “The goal for interaction is to support situated action and meaning - making in specific contexts , and the questions that arise revolve around how to complement formalized , computational representations and actions with the rich , complex , and messy situations at hand around them . Because of its emphasis on multiple meanings made in con - text , we term the third paradigm situated perspectives . ” [ 18 ] . In short , the third wave recognises the prominence of relationships and meaning - making between humans and machines in context . This wave brings an emphasis on experience as the primary object of study , which has a relevant impact on what methods are suitable . Design problems are generally wicked [ 5 , 38 ] , and therefore , can only be tackled with a large degree of flexibility , where methods need to often be adapted to the specific and unique issue at hand , with more interest in their direct applicability than in generalisation [ 43 ] . This justifies a shift towards a less strict use of methods , where pragmatism is the rule . If all knowledge , use , and experience is assumed to be situated and contextualised , then it is not surprising that ethnographic methods saw a rise in acceptance in this third wave HCI , particularly as a set of approaches that inform system requirements [ 24 ] . Ethnography is a common way to tackle the situated nature of these interactions , including longitudinal studies being applied to families in their homes , in order to reveal the intricacies of their ex - periences . Fernaeus et al . [ 15 ] for example , describe a longitudinal study where a robotic toy animal was sent to six families . Petrelli and Light [ 37 ] on the other hand presents an intricate study of eight families in Northern England , where the results are presented in the manner of rich and detailed histories of how these families celebrate Christmas , without any new technology being the main object of study . Mazmanian and Lanette [ 34 ] set out to understand the difficulties of parenting in a digital age through ethnography stating even that “as with all ethnographic research , the ideal of a large and ‘representative’ sample size is replaced with depth of insight and nuance of findings . ” . Derix and Leong [ 9 ] uses probes to understand different perspectives within sets of parents . While all these studies support a rich and phenomenological situated under - standing of the interactions , they do not serve to give a first - person Living with Drones , Robots , and Young Children : Informing Research through Design with Autoethnography NordiCHI ’22 , October 8 – 12 , 2022 , Aarhus , Denmark perspective to the researcher , nor to inform a RtD process from a unique personalised and intimate standpoint . The detail in the reports in the third person may lack some of the more interest - ing critical challenges which surface through autoethnographic approaches . 2 . 2 Autoethnography in RtD Autoethnography is an increasingly popular approach within third wave ( and potentially fourth wave [ 16 ] ) HCI , which takes into consideration the importance of first - person understanding of the technology at hand and uses the personal experience as research material [ 13 ] . Ellis et al . [ 13 ] describe how autoethnography is a merging of an autobiographical method with the ethnographical one , while challenging ideas about the separability of researcher and research product . Within HCI , Ljungblad [ 31 ] used a life - logging passive camera alongside her participants , while Höök [ 22 ] , for example , transfers many of the qualities she found in her own practice of horseback riding into design . Lucero [ 33 ] reports on living without a mobile phone , offering important themes to be considered when designing for that technology . Homewood et al . [ 21 ] propose removal of technologies as a method for fourth wave HCI based on two autoethnographies on self tracking . A similar approach , connected to RtD , is named autobiographical design , where probes are used by the designers themselves [ 35 ] . Yang and Neustaedter [ 49 ] reports on a three month period use of a telep - resence robot to support a long distance relationship , and Lockton et al . [ 32 ] develop the notion of autoethnographic ’kits’ through the work of undergraduates related to their sleep routines . In a more intimate context , Helms [ 19 ] uses autobiographical design to discuss more - than - human materials and agencies in the context of breastfeeding . In this privileged position as a researcher , we are endowed with the capability to tell stories . But this process is not without ethical and epistemological trouble , which could end up in severe diffi - culties to be executed and published [ 48 ] . Desjardins and Ball [ 10 ] present sincerity , collaboration and authority , and inventiveness as recommendations for autobiographical design projects . I incor - porated these into my work in the form of values to be followed while reporting the results . When approaching design projects with a RtD agenda [ 17 , 29 , 51 ] , we must understand that designers “make all kinds of decisions and judgments , such as , how to frame the situation , who to listen to , what to pay attention to , what to dismiss , and how to explore , extract , recognize , and choose useful information from all of these potential sources . ” [ 43 ] . Ellingson [ 12 ] describes how autoethnog - raphy incorporates embodied experiences directing attention not only on what is said or done , but how it is felt , how the researcher’s body is positioned and understood in space . Therefore , it is vital to incorporate the first - person perspective of the designer into the re - search process , particularly when defining the design space . Hence , I consider autoethnography necessarily and directly connected to RtD . However , I recognise a difficulty in analysing data generated by the researchers themselves , and in articulating design consid - erations which can be applied in further research . Therefore , I set out to experiment on a combination of methods which would work to this end , and recruited a perspective I had been interested in : Sociotechnical Systems . 2 . 3 Sociotechnical Systems Sociotechnical Systems ( StS 1 ) is an example of a holistic theory compatible with design research . It can be combined with an un - derstanding of ’soft systems’ , which opens up for not only focusing on the system itself , but on one’s methodological approach to it [ 6 ] . ’Soft systems’ are open and ill - defined systems , where there are divergent views of what constitutes a problem , and even on what the system boundaries are ( what elements constitute the sys - tem ) . In the context of this research , studying social drones could encompass a large number of specific goals to be tackled . Social drones , as defined by Baytaş et al . [ 2 ] are “applications where fully autonomous drones operate in spaces populated by human users or bystanders” . In the case of current research we depart from tele - operated drones to study relationships built in society which will eventually inform the design of fully autonomous drones . In the case at hand , I advocate for an approach where a singular research goal is not primary , and that the wicked nature of the research field of social drones requires alternative methods . By combining StS with autoethnography , the aim is not to ab - stract knowledge or reduce designer bias into the design process , but instead to incite deep phenomenological first - person experi - ences as a part of the design process and a factor to consider as part of the system itself [ 23 ] . The main aim of this paper is to inform a detailed understanding of a design space , and to that end I propose and engage with autoethnography combined with StS as a suitable method for designers , as it allows for a deep , personal , and detailed understanding of the systems themselves . To be able to study other families , it is important to consider one’s own standpoint as a re - searcher and designer as a first threshold in sensibility towards other engagements with emerging micro - interactions . Applying methods and frameworks pertaining to StS when planning , con - ducting , analysing , and presenting ethnography may be a suitable approach . As exemplified by Kirwan [ 28 ] , the application of StS and ’soft systems’ is more clearly connected to industries and work places [ 28 ] 2 . In this paper , I argue that a family is a ’soft’ multi - level ( albeit small ) system . Due to the relatively small number of elements in families and the tacit nature of the relationship built between them , I denominate the system being studied a micro - sociotechnical system ( micro - StS ) . The distinction between StS and micro - StS is made to allow for systems with much more limited boundaries to be studied and analysed while indicating a high degree of variability and flexibility stemming from the volatility of the elements . The emphasis on a micro - StS is on short emergent and tacit situations which may at first seem nearly insignificant . 1 STS can also be an abbreviation for Science and Technology Studies , which is not to be confused with the use of StS in this paper for Sociotechnical Systems 2 I feel however that I must take an epistemological stance against Kirwan’s under - standing of soft science as described : “The paper itself is written in less formal style than is usually the case for journal articles ; this is partly because it is very much a condensation of practical experience rather than of scientific knowledge or data , and also because a more formal style may lose some of the impact of the lessons that have been learned . ” [ 28 ] Practical experience is most definitely worthwhile knowledge which should not be directly connected to informality or lack of rigour . NordiCHI ’22 , October 8 – 12 , 2022 , Aarhus , Denmark Mafalda Gamboa Silverstone [ 40 ] refers to “domestic socio - technical systems” while studying in detail the intricate network of computers , televi - sions , telephones , all of which have shifted from having a particular place in the domestic environment to now being mobile . The do - mestic space has been extended outside the walls of the home , and therefore , the StS I am studying considers the family its core , rather than the technologies . Even without always explicitly mentioning StS , there are studies that already describe families as system . An example is provided by Taylor and Swan [ 44 ] , where the systems created by caregivers to organise their own families result in de - sign artefacts in the home . One of the robots appropriated in this study ( Purrble ) is the result of a well developed design process informed by StS [ 41 , 45 ] . Multiple stakeholders in families inform the design , becoming an example of how the whole family ought to be taken in consideration when creating domestic probes “The principles of socio - technical design then apply on multiple lev - els : how the ( technology - enabled ) intervention becomes embedded into the current practices of an individual or the family unit ; which mechanisms are assumed to lead to shift of these practices ; and on which timescales and through which ‘levers’ this happens in the family context . ” [ 41 ] 3 METHOD To gain a deep understanding of incorporating small drones into do - mesticity , I have conducted a longitudinal autoethnographic study with my family and the places where we live as a unit . As pointed out by Leite et al . [ 30 ] , longitudinal studies are helpful to explore beyond the novelty value of social robots , particularly in a domestic setting . In this article , I report on a year long introduction of off - the - shelf remotely controlled DJI Tello drones into the micro - StS ( our family ) . The goal was to understand how a drone may be ex - perienced and used by a family in everyday life over a longer time period . The insertion of new technologies into the existing micro - StS results in new interactions which can be turned into important design insight : “Humans and technologies in households are inter - connected as members or elements of the same system . When a new element is introduced to the system , the system goes through a process of integration that may result in the re - organization of roles , relationships and functions . ” [ 26 ] The studies started in December 2020 and span so far until No - vember 2021 . I have documented the events through photo , video , and diary notes . The results presented stem from the most relevant events and opportunities to serve the definition of the design space . I identified and organised elements in the sociotechnical system as shown on Figure 3 . Each of these elements or nodes is described in the following subsection . As a novel approach to autoethnography and an aid to guide the reporting and documenting of the results , I have used repre - sentations of the system based on the framework presented by Davis et al . , which stems from a schema that has been developed by a number of authors . For Davis et al . “the core idea is that any complex organizational system can be represented in the form of a hexagon” [ 8 ] . The framework is described as : “ ( . . . ) a work system will usually have a set of goals and metrics , involve people ( with varying attitudes and skills ) , using a range of technologies and tools , working within a physical infrastructure , operating with a set of cultural assumptions , and using sets of processes and working practices . The system sits within a wider context , incorporating a regulatory framework , sets of stakeholders ( including customers ) , and an economic / financial environment . ” [ 8 ] This framework is used in this paper to support the reader’s in - terpretation of the narratives exposed which can be highly tacit and difficult to pinpoint . The advantage of this framework in particular is that it focuses not only on accident analysis which is important for many work systems , it instead “is an attempt to provide a simple yet powerful representation of the interdependent nature of work systems , providing a framework for analyzing the linkages and relationships between the different social and technical aspects . The potential value of applying such an approach is that it provides a structured and systematic way of analyzing a variety of complex systems , problems and events . ” [ 8 ] In the current work , the wider context is given by the research project it is framed within , and driven by the academic and research expectations described in the background . 3 . 1 Description of the System In this section I describe the elements or nodes represented in Fig - ure 3 . Each of the elements or nodes can also be found on Table 3 . 1 . The study was conducted with our core family of four , composed of the people mentioned on Table 3 . 1 . This description was developed at the start of the study in order to support a reflective analysis of the context at hand . As the system is being researched through autoethnography , I based the description on my own perception of our family and of my goals with the study . While the use of an StS approach attempts to make the representation of the autoethno - graphic context more systematic , it is also not possible to read this description as an objective characterisation of my family . As a member of the system myself , my views are undoubtedly biased , and the forging of the system does not attempt to hide that fact . The buildings / infrastructure involved are mostly our apart - ment , but also a couple of other family vacation locations . Our apartment is a three bedroom on the second floor , 95 square meters , but located in a three family villa where we share a garden and outside space . The robots or technology studied can also be seen on Table 3 . 1 . There are 3 land robots and 1 flying robot . Firstly , Grassy 3 is an outdoor lawn mower and existed in our home before the study started . Doc 4 is an educational humanoid robot with a simple set of tasks and games to support learning programming , and had also been bought at least two years previous . Since the research is focused on drones , Tello 5 represented the most relevant robot and was acquired at the start of the study . The Tello drone is sold and advertised as a drone for children , also supporting activities to learn programming . To match it with another robot , I brought home Purrble 6 as an important addition due to the research background behind its development [ 41 , 45 ] and contrasting characteristics to the drone ( soft , quiet , static ) . The main goals for the system for this particular study are three - fold : wellbeing , documenting , and research . Wellbeing is an 3 https : / / www . worx - europe . com 4 https : / / www . clementoni . com / fi / 78281 - doc - educational - talking - robot / 5 https : / / www . ryzerobotics . com / tello - edu 6 https : / / www . purrble . com / Living with Drones , Robots , and Young Children : Informing Research through Design with Autoethnography NordiCHI ’22 , October 8 – 12 , 2022 , Aarhus , Denmark Figure 3 : To the left , the autoethnographic study as a micro - sociotechnical system based on the StS framework presented by Davis et al . [ 8 ] overarching goal for our family and can include sub - goals such as play , feeding , supporting , or even supporting a quiet environment . The goals as a family are a lot more difficult to describe – these particular three were chosen as the ones leading the interactions and initiatives we take in our home in the context of this study . Therefore , documenting and research became the primary aim . The culture in our home is relevant to the interactions that sur - faced . I identified love , discipline , openness , and unity as essential principles for our family . In general , our parenting is focused on hav - ing open relationships where we discuss emotions without hiding them from the children , and promoting their sharing . Furthermore , we consider our home an open environment where friends are welcome spontaneously , but we still make sure to communicate that we are one unit in acting and making decisions . An important value is discipline , which results in clear rules and boundaries and rules everyone follows , such as keeping order and cleanliness in the apartment . The most relevant processes in the study are rituals , chores , and rules . Related to the value of discipline , there are clear rules that we follow at home ( e . g . shoes are left in the hallway , no candy during week days ) . Life with younger children is filled with rituals ( e . g . bath - time , bed - time , story - time ) , but also chores ( e . g . cleaning after play , taking plates from the table to the kitchen sink ) . Examples of these processes are relevant to the descriptions of the interactions that emerged . 4 RESULTS The results are presented in two sections : ( a ) micro - StS system driven critical incidents which are “documented incidents of use ; and careful articulation of the impact of design decisions on experi - ential qualities of the system in use” [ 35 ] and ( b ) opportunities for child - drone interaction design probes . The first section includes the description of critical incidents informed by the different categories in the StS system described above .

[ 8 ] . connecting elements of the system which are described below as narratives . 4 . 1 Critical Incidents and Narratives In the following sub - section I present diary extracts from incidents that happened , either during short phases or as repeated behaviour . The results presented are analysed through the StS framing , by first gathering and describing the situations through the diary logs , identifying the StS elements present , and developing a narrative of sense - making grounded in both the narrative and the pinpointed elements . Therefore , some of the extracts were written in one ses - sion , while others are composed from a set of different events . The selection of incidents to be included was curated to support and illustrate the understanding of the subsequent opportunities for child - drone interaction . 4 . 1 . 1 Not in bed : As we were going to bed , after brushing our teeth , Purrble was lying in Elsa’s bed together with a number of other stuffed toys . Usually , we read a book before falling asleep but Elsa was more interested in arguing as to why we should get a pet , a real one , not a fake one like Purrble . This small discussion had entirely disrupted our usual bed - time ritual but since I was interested in her reflections I let it continue . As she was overcome by sleepiness , she asked me to turn off the robot and put it away but still in bed . When I asked her why , she said : “I am afraid it will wake me up . ” , Are you not afraid a real pet would also wake you up ? , “Maybe . . . ” , But you are not afraid I will wake you up ? , “I know you want me to sleep . ” , Do you still want a pet ? , “Maybe not , not if it wakes me up . ” . StS Elements : Goals : Wellbeing ; People : Me , Elsa ; Culture : Love ; Processes : Rituals ; Technology : Purrble ; Building : Bed - room ; Sense - making : Even though the aim of this robot is to support children’s self - regulation of strong emotions through a comforting heartbeat , the sound was not a welcoming factor in Elsa’s most intimate moment of sleep . Its soft body made it a logical addition to all the other stuffed toys which “watch over” the children in bed , but its interactive abilities set it apart . Luckily , this led into a discussion about companionship and pet ownership which was valuable for our family . 4 . 1 . 2 Visitors , Fear , and Enactment : On a particularly sunny summer day , we had visitors over , including two girls aged 8 and 6 . The father was interested in the research I am doing and im - mediately started touching and asking about the drones . We went outdoors to our garden , and I took with me some extra batteries . The visiting children were interested in being able to control the drone , but the father was very hesitant . We played for some min - utes a game where the drone chased the kids , which had become the number one activity we did . The father in the visiting family suggested the kids would try driving the drone , but it became clear the drone was too difficult to drive for the visiting child . Instead , the children ended up pretending they were driving on the phone , while Elsa held the drone in her hand , enacting flight . An image of this enactment can be seen on Figure 4 . A similar situation hap - pened when we were out , during the winter , and I took the drone for a visit to the children’s grandparents where we went snow sledging . Both of the grandparents never showed any inclination to fly the drone , and were genuinely afraid of driving it . The drone was seen as more of an annoyance rather than an interesting way to document the day . StS Elements : Goals : Wellbeing ; People : Core Family plus Visitors ; Culture : Love , Discipline ; Processes : Rules ; Technology : Tello Building : Garden and Elsewhere ; Sense - making : While the children had no reservations towards the drones , the adults were more careful . Upon further inquiry , I noticed they were either afraid the children would get hurt or the drone would be destroyed . Remarkably , children themselves found ways around the limitations , through deeply embodied enactment Living with Drones , Robots , and Young Children : Informing Research through Design with Autoethnography NordiCHI ’22 , October 8 – 12 , 2022 , Aarhus , Denmark of the technical interactions they could not perform . Their activity made the drone active even though it was turned off . Furthermore , the fact that I did not even consider flying the drone indoors with that many children at home made me realise I was afraid of doing so – would I not be afraid as well to conduct other ethnographic studies with other children ? 4 . 1 . 3 A Broken Pool : Since its installation , the robot lawn mower ( Grassy ) had been an object of entertainment for the family . I found myself and the neighbour downstairs often staring at it as it moved around the garden . When it was first installed , the path it would follow was rather defective , and the children found it amusing to wake up in the morning and check where the robot had gotten stuck , and would say “Poor little robot” . On a summer evening , we filled a small inflatable pool with water and left it outdoors over the night . The next morning , the robot had cut through the plastic and the pool was ruined . The feelings of the children towards the robot changed somewhat after this event , and in the morning , they were no longer as worried about the robot , but rather more concerned to remove things from its path . Curiously , Anna is a lot more comfortable with the mower than with the drone . When I asked her about it , she was unable to say why . But as time passed , I noted how she knew exactly what the lawn mower could do and where she would be safe from it , which she never could with the drone . Its predictability became a reassurance . StS Elements : Goals : Wellbeing ; People : Core family ; Culture : Discipline , Openness ; Processes : Rules ; Technology : Grassy ; Building : Garden ; Sense - making : Both the children and adults in our household of - ten laughed at the small troubles Grassy would find itself in during its grass - cutting tours ( An example lawn mower in trouble can be seen on Figure 4 ) . The mishaps became part of a constructed per - sonality . But once it started harming their ownership , the children quickly started rearranging their environment around it because they could better understand where the robot would go : the pre - dictability of the path of the lawn mower is a safety point and a quality . They never asked if the robot could be put away or turned off , they instead adapted their lives to its presence . What could be the potential accommodations made towards a companion drone in the home ? 4 . 1 . 4 TalkingAboutRobots , Autonomy , andOwnership : Six months after the drone was brought into our apartment , the chil - dren had been talking about robots in school . They came home imitating a robot ( talking slowly , moving with stiff arms ) . We had repeatedly tried to talk about what a robot is or is not , but their opinions changed throughout the year . According to Elsa , of the robots we had at home , only the drone was not one . Why is that ? “This one can speak . ” , she says , picking up Doc . But the other ones do not “Yes , the fluffy one does . Just a little . Like this . ” , and she starts imitating the gibberish Purrble does when happy or sad . But what about the lawn mower ? “It is also a robot , it does what it wants . ” . When further questioned , the drone seemed to lack agency in her eyes , even if the humanoid robot ( Doc ) also needed to be controlled through the buttons on its head , the fact that it could talk back was perceived as agency . Another interesting piece of this conversation had to do with ownership . While the robots that lived in our home were seen by the children as ours , the lawn mower seemed to own itself , which contributed to its robotic status . It was clear to Elsa that the drone was mine , Doc was hers , and the Purrble was ev - eryone’s . Doc was therefore a toy robot , the Purrble a pet robot , and the drone just mom’s stuff , therefore not a robot . StS Elements : Goals : Wellbeing , Research ; People : Me , Elsa ; Culture : Openness ; Processes : Rules ; Technology : All ; Building : Living Room ; Sense - making : The repetitions of ownership continued beyond this journal entry . Both the children had a hard time ever perceiving the drone as a robot : what was constant was the argument of own - ership . This made me reconsider the way the drone was introduced to the family – perhaps I made a mistake not gifting it to one of the children . The Purrble , for example , has a very well designed box where the transfer of ownership is made to the children in a careful manner . In what way could the sense of autonomy and ownership be developed with the drone ? 4 . 1 . 5 Excluding the Small One : During this year of engaging with robots , Anna , who has been between 2 , 5 and 3 , 5 years old has developed a complicated relationship with the drone . While at first both children were equally excited when the drone was flying , as time passed , Anna became wary of the robot . Her body language showed clearly that she was not up to any closer contact ( e . g . the second image in Figure 6 , where Anna holds her arms up . Picture taken from the drone’s perspective ) , and very seldom asked for the drone to be active . In comparison , she was always happy to engage with the other robots at home . Anna is particularly sensitive to noise , and therefore she would often hide in another room when the drone was flying . Her mistrust of the robot eventually became just an annoyance for her ( e . g . the third image on Figure 6 shows how she used the drone’s box as a resting place for her pacifier , while every time I moved the box , Elsa would ask me to turn on the drone ) . The first image in Figure 6 shows Anna in the background and playing around me , my partner , and her sister while we figure out how to program the drone . Anna was completely uninterested in the situation . Because of this , I used the drone less and less in our family as I felt it was excluding Anna from participating in our activities , coming into conflict with our culture of unity . This was much unlike the use of Purrble , where Anna’s interest developed during this year and she would more and more often reach out to it , and even have it close to her body . The last image on Figure 7 shows Anna holding the robot next to her face while petting it . StS Elements : Goals : Wellbeing , Research ; People : Core fam - ily towards Anna ; Culture : Love , Unity ; Processes : Rituals ; Tech - nology : Tello ; Building : Indoors ; Sense - making : When a drone is introduced into a home – even if the robot is age appropriate for one of the children or adults – there is a strong bystander effect where many others may be affected . Unlike the other robots , the drone strongly impacted the feelings in our home and created conflict where the younger child found herself being excluded . In this moment , the wellbeing of our family came over the other goals , and the lack of care we had had with our youngest became evident . This is an important factor to be considered when developing drones . While all robots may be NordiCHI ’22 , October 8 – 12 , 2022 , Aarhus , Denmark Mafalda Gamboa Figure 4 : Three images showing ( left ) two 6 year old girls enacting the control and flight of a drone , ( middle ) a snow sled ride on a winter day , and ( right ) a lawn mower stuck on a net .

Should age appropriateness therefore include potential harm to other groups , particularly in a home context ? 4 . 1 . 6 CommandandEmbodiedInteractionswiththeDrone . Elsa was from the start eager to be able to control the drone herself , but I was hesitant . The times she tried , it was too difficult for her to remote control the drone , which eventually felt unsafe in her hands . She had difficulties programming the drone from its perspective , and not hers . Her enthusiasm for the drone was great at first and we could even start to see representations of it in her drawings ( See Figure 5 ) . To try to compensate for her own lack of potential direct control , Elsa came up with games and obstacles in our living room which she would then ask me to overcome with the drone . The hurdle tracks she would create included furniture and pillows , and one time , it even included candles that the drone should blow off through the air movements of the propellers ( Figure 5 , on the right , shows a drone flying over a candle ) . While she could eventually understand how Doc was programmed ( step - wise , in a grid ) , the drone was always too complicated for her , with too many dimen - sions and granularity of movement . But because of its intricate movement , the paths she imagined the drone could fly were more interesting than any of the spaces of the other robots . The drone had the capacity to make her imagine worlds where it could do things by her pointing , following gestural command , but even to be able to engage with other toys in our home . For example , she imagined the drone could turn off the lights , carry other toys to her , or even be part of the stories in the games . On Figure 6 , Elsa can be seen trying to program the drone with me , but her most important contribution was picking up a small figurine that would ride the drone ( it can be seen lying next to the drone in the image ) . StS Elements : Goals : Research People : Elsa , Me ; Culture : Open - ness ; Processes : Rules ; Technology : Tello ; Building : Indoors ; Sense - making : The clear advantage of the drone over the other robots is its freedom of movement . While the other robots did not seem to inspire any other possible interactions , the drone supported a creation of worlds and functions in a three dimensional space . Is there an opportunity for truly engaged embodied interactions in the home , expanding the space of the home from the floor to the ceiling ? This particular situation made me reflect on the antiquated user - bystander dichotomy . In this situation , who was the user and who was the bystander ? To me , Elsa was the user and I was merely a translator between her and the drone . This means any age limit in the box of the drone is rendered almost irrelevant – even if the Tello drone is not advised for such small children , the actual user ( me ) was well above the age recommendation . 4 . 1 . 7 My Own Relationship with the Research Material . As this year of autoethnography started , I would fiddle with the drone often . I was excited to get started , and recruited my partner to start documenting if he saw anything interesting . The enthusiasm wore off on our oldest daughter , who showed a lot of interest at Living with Drones , Robots , and Young Children : Informing Research through Design with Autoethnography NordiCHI ’22 , October 8 – 12 , 2022 , Aarhus , Denmark Figure 6 : Three images showing ( left ) Elsa and I setting up the drone for programmed flight , in the background , Anna can be seen playing , ( middle ) picture taken by the drone where Anna covers her face from the drone , ( right ) Anna leaves her pacifier on top of the drone box Figure 7 : Four images showing ( left ) Elsa chasing the drone to help it land by climbing on furniture , ( middle - left ) Elsa fiddling with the drone propellers , ( middle - right ) Elsa with the drone stuck to her hair and ( right ) Anna holding Purrble close to her face . first on what the drone was and could do . But as time went by , I found less and less patience to cope with yet another noisy element in our home during the evenings . Living with small children leads to a hectic environment , and the noise of the drone became too much to bear at times . When taking the drone with us to interact with others , I often felt as if the people around me were bothered by the presence of the drone and showed a lack of interest in it - it was my research object and not theirs . It was extremely rare that anyone asked or was willing to control the drone themselves . So as time passed , I too lost interest in being engaged with the drone , and as I lost interest , nobody else picked it up . The drone started gathering dust , while both me and the children often engage with Purrble . Its calm nature helps in creating peaceful relationships with the children , while both Doc and the Tello contribute to a noisy but more active environment . Elsa did often ask if we could fly the drone , but in our busy lives , the addition of another moment of exciting and noisy activity in the evenings became less and less desirable . The documentation process was easier due to the drone’s camera : when conducting autoethnography with children and robots , if there is no assistance in documenting , the act of documenting itself can be disruptive . Therefore , many of the interactions with the other robots were only registered through diaries , and many of the interesting quotes the children said were lost . I had expected the robots to be embedded into our rituals and routines , but this never happened , and alas , each documentation session felt somewhat forced . StSElements : Goals : Documenting , Research ; People : Me , Part - ner ; Culture : Love , Unity ; Processes : Rituals , Chores ; Technol - ogy : Tello , Purrble ; Building : Indoors ; Sense - making : The novelty effect wore off quickly for the drone , not only because of our hectic lives , but also because of its disruptive nature . This resulted in some guilt on my side , where I felt like I was disconnecting from the technology I was meant to research . But most of all I did not know what to do with the drone itself as it started fading into the background of our home : was there an appropriate way to unmake its presence ? 4 . 2 Opportunities for Child - Drone Interaction Design Through the relationship created between the drone and my chil - dren I have extracted design opportunities for child - drone Interac - tion as a guiding compass for the creation of design probes . These opportunities are described as ideas to consider and do not have any prescriptive value . They seek to offer perspectives to be added to a more sensible and critical approach to HDI , rather than desirable or necessary actions . NordiCHI ’22 , October 8 – 12 , 2022 , Aarhus , Denmark Mafalda Gamboa Figure 8 : The children hide from the drone behind furniture . Touch : The children created intricate touch interactions with the drone , which were not limited to carrying it . The propellers are easy to fiddle with when the drone is inactive . However , its cold surface never led to a closer contact with any other body part . Even when decorated with feathers ( which the children did touch and play with ) , no further closeness was exhibited . The most exciting of activities were connected with the drone landing or taking off on body parts , such as on the hand . Although the ability to touch does not seem to have any relationship to the childrens perception of autonomy , it still promoted a clearer path to ownership . Carefully manipulating the materiality of the drone is a relevant endeavour to consider . Enactment in 3D Space : A unique characteristic of the drone is its ability to be enacted as a flying robot . From an embodied perspective , the play that it generates is more interesting than what land robots do . The children were able to stretch their arms to the sky , and relate to the spaces higher above , while when interacting with all other robots , their bodily positioning was either crouched or curled up . Therefore the drone clearly opens up for a varied experience in the kinaesthetic relationship between the children and the robotic agent . Directed Play in 3D Space : While the children were interested in learning how to program the robots , they were even more inter - ested in being able to give it commands to follow verbally . While the land robots could easily reach the points the children wanted them to , the drone engaged them in a much richer repertoire of play . Because of its ability to move in all directions , move air , make noise , and collapse catastrophically , the children came up with paths and stories for the drone to enact around the apartment , using different obstacles and spaces in a dynamic way . Creating probes that take into consideration these substantial engagements with the context is worthwhile . Wickedness and Attention : The drone had the ability to en - gage the children . While every time the drone was active there was general excitement , which was sometimes resolved by brave attempts to engage bodily in proximity with the drone , but mostly resulted in hiding or protective behaviours . The children would either hide behind furniture or an adult , and observe intensely the activity of the drone ( See Figure 8 ) . This wickedness of the drone had the great ability to fully absorb the attention of the children , and direct it elsewhere . In - between States : Drones are either off , or on . And their off or on states are dramatic : a drone can not turn off mid - flight or it will collapse . It also does not exhibit stand - by behaviour . Therefore , when inactive , the drone appears to be entirely lifeless , when ac - tive , it is in constant movement . When constructing probes for the home it may be valuable to consider the possible spectrum of states designed for . Difficult Ownership , Safety , and Right to Repair : The chil - dren had trouble understanding how they could independently engage with the drone . Simple tasks such as the handling of the bat - teries or replacement of the propellers make the drone an unlikely companion for young children . Considering independence in the design of all the stages of the interaction is fundamental to support a feeling of ownership . However , the difficulty here is to combine the possibility of ownership with the complicated task of making the drone safe or even compatible with small children , given that so many of their characteristics are inherently dangerous or inac - cessible ( e . g . high noise volumes , dangerous moving parts , unstable movement ) . There is a possibility that the care - taking necessities of the drone could contribute to the interaction , but these need to be carefully developed with all members of the families in mind . At times , the shelving of the drone was due to minor repairs that were too complex or time consuming . The right for repair to be conducted by the children is also a necessary element for the true sense of ownership to be developed through relationships of care , using simple interactions and modular open - access design . Culture , Values , and Type of Play : When using the drone , it became clear that the structures in the family changed . Some dis - tanced themselves , other engaged directly . Some family members were annoyed , disturbed , or even fearful of the technology . Most def - initely , the drone created an impression . One must consider which cultural weight is designed into the drones , and what type of play it is supporting . Actively stating the goals , culture , and processes within StS the probe is aiming at may be helpful in appreciating which values and type of engagement the drone is creating within a family . Similarly , when designing and promoting the drones to a wider audience , it is important to clearly communicate which values the design is supporting , and inform on the potential harm it may cause . Anticipated Experience and Death of the Drone : The pack - aging of the drone was not particularly appealing to the children Living with Drones , Robots , and Young Children : Informing Research through Design with Autoethnography NordiCHI ’22 , October 8 – 12 , 2022 , Aarhus , Denmark and required a lot of support from an adult in unpacking and mak - ing sense of all the information . When trying to store the drone , the packaging was not particularly helpful , and therefore the robot ended up literally collecting dust on a shelf . We were uncertain how to sustainably deal with the lack of interest from the children towards the drone . Ultimately – we were uncertain how to dispose of the drone in a sustainable way . It is necessary to consider how to support both the anticipated use [ 25 ] , and the post - use of the drone as a part of the design . Together with work on the right to repair , the death of the drone may be more sustainably delayed . Unmaking : Mostimportantly , whendesigningdrones , oneshould consider if they should at all be designed for the context at hand . While a product can be labelled as not appropriate for a 3 year old , it may still be used in their vicinity , forcing them to interact with it . Through considerate reflection and the design of critical probes , designers can question unresolved issues of sustainability , safety , legislation , and ethics . The work of designers may be to aid in the unmaking of drones in certain situations , and support the discussion of issues such as the potentially obsolete user - bystander dichotomy . 5 DISCUSSION In this section , I discuss the results as framed by the two research questions , startingwithissuesrelatingtodrones , followedby method - ological considerations , and a shorter discussion on the ethics of this study . 5 . 1 Drones and Children The second research question that framed this study was : “What is the impact of incorporating toy drones in a domestic environment with small children ? ” After one year of cohabiting with these robots , observing , facilitating , and supporting my children’s relationship with them , I have found myself in a deeply critical posture towards children - drone interaction in a domestic context . As a designer , I am concerned about which values are embedded into the systems we produce . And indeed , this ethnographic account brought forward the disturbances that the presence of a drone left in our family , and the impact in terms of relational concerns from an ethics per - spective e . g . [ 13 ] . As mentioned in the introduction , it is vital for my research to understand why families bring these potentially disruptive robots into their everyday , and what value they bring . It is fair to say that the grandparent who buys a toy drone for their grandchild is unaware of the imbalance they may unwillingly bring into the home . Previous research has shown that there are concerns both on how drones may be used to stalk children , but also when regarding children as users [ 4 ] . Boucher [ 4 ] notes how a number of participants in a survey were surprised that toy drones were available on a small budget and feared deliberate and accidental misuse . As designers , it is our responsibility to clearly state and communicate the values materialised into the design [ 47 ] , and seek to either prevent these risks , transparently communicate them , or work together in the potential ethical unmaking of these drones . This call for transparency is not novel within technology for chil - dren [ 50 ] , but it seems to be particularly relevant for drones . The lack of studies with children and drones [ 36 ] is problematic , not only when perceiving children as users , but by merely considering their encounters with drones . It is perhaps no surprise that there are nearly no research studies with children and drones , given the ethical and safety issues they could cause . The few studies that can be found make sure , for example , to reduce all risk by casing in the drones [ 39 ] . This lack of studies seems to be in mismatch with the reality of toy drones , as a simple search on Amazon for “toy drone” generates more than 2 , 000 products and some with more than 15 , 000 reviews . But the issue with children interacting with drones exists beyond considering them users in a traditional way . My autoethnographic study could have been conducted in the same way by describing myself ( an adult ) as the sole user of the drone – and yet , the children would have been exactly as impacted and engaged with it . This indicates that the borders of user - bystander may be less helpful than we would think in HDI . 5 . 2 Autoethnography and micro - StS in RtD I applied a combination of methods in order to answer the first research question , “What is the contribution of an auto - ethnographic study , supported by Sociotechnical Systems , in formulating design considerations for Research through Design ? ” From a methodolog - ical perspective , I found resonance with many of the difficulties presented by Wall [ 48 ] , in a struggle to make the value of this study clear to my academic peers . In fact , these studies may have harmed my relationship to drones as an RtD design material : I find myself often questioning if drones and children are at all a compatible combination , and to what extent I would like to introduce these machines as objects of study in other families . Simultaneously , the knowledge gained made me acutely aware of my importance as a researcher and designer within HDI . While this study made me rather sceptical of the role of drones in the home , it also opened up for a more nuanced and techno - critical stance moving along . The conclusions presented offer a reflective longitudinal account of a shared space informed by a genuine and contextualised ap - propriation of the technology which can be easily translated into RtD probes , particularly ones of a provocative nature . However , any researcher considering conducting autoethnography with their own design material should be aware that while the conclusions and the process are useful and substantial , they come at the cost of an understanding of the technology at hand which will strongly impact their approach to the research material . Helms and Fernaeus [ 20 ] exemplify these struggles , mentioning for example how au - tobiographical design researchers may have trouble in the dual relationship between designing for loved ones and being a good researcher . Theusethenovelmicro - StSapproachcombinedwithautoethnog - raphy was helpful as a base to express tacit experiences , and to be able to reflect upon the interactions that emerged and make them explicit . Because the documentation and results were centred on a negotiation of the goals , processes , and values in our home , it was easier to pinpoint and report upon changes in the relationships within the system . In hindsight , for example , my ambition to make this work happen should have been regarded as a clear value in the system – this missed cultural value could have resulted in fur - ther reflections when analysing the data . As the work continues , I propose informing the method with further research done in the social sciences within autoethnography in order to inform a more NordiCHI ’22 , October 8 – 12 , 2022 , Aarhus , Denmark Mafalda Gamboa appropriate framework which could lead into evocative narratives . The attempt to summarise the findings into design implications may have reduced some of their usefulness as rich stories , as the stories themselves are tacit and derived from a daily reality which is not always appropriate or possible to express into design knowl - edge . The design implications may be misread without the coupling to the stories . Apropos , Dourish [ 11 ] questions the formulation of results within ethnography as implications for design , arguing that they are not necessary – furthermore , that expressing ethnographic knowledge as design requirements is instead a limitation : “the liaison between analytic ethnography and de - sign could well form the field of a practical sociology committed to a serious engagement with the design problematic - the interventionist impulse . Such a prac - tical sociology could not eschew prescriptivism , as designers frequently accuse ethnography of doing . But its prescriptions and predictions may well not match those that designers currently seek . Instead of providing yet more grist to the mill of conventional design solutions , ethnography may offer sensibilities that will cause designers to question the presupposi - tions of their conventional outlooks . ” [ 1 ] In this aspect , the novel micro - StS approach presented is a valu - able tool to document and make explicit to others what is relevant in the system being studied , rather than focusing merely on require - ment gathering or even prescription of action . While the results presented are helpful from a reflective practice perspective , they are difficult to express as design knowledge . The opportunities sug - gested are topics to be consider rather than best practices , and have no particular intention in solving problems , but rather in offering critical perspectives which ought to be considered in future research in a sensitivity - building manner . However , to be able to transmit and represent tacit ethnographic findings in a readable manner , we can make use of StS frameworks . It is likely that this first year of ethnography was highly stained by what criteria I perceive to be important to present as results within HCI . In following work , I find the need to reconsider how to best present the work and its narrative : “The narrative text refuses the impulse to abstract and explain , stressing the journey over the destina - tion , and thus eclipses the scientific illusion of control and mastery ; and the episodic portrayal of the ebb and flow of relationship experience dramatises the motion of connected lives across the curve of time , and thus resists the standard practice of portraying social life and relationships as a snapshot . Evocative stories activate subjectivity and compile emotional response . They long to be used rather than analysed ; to be told and retold rather than theorised and set - tled ; to offer lessons for further conversation rather than undebatable conclusions ; and to substitute the companionship of intimate detail for the loneliness of abstracted facts . ” [ 14 , 744 ] 5 . 3 Ethics and Limitations The question of ethics in this study is a complicated one – while I advocate that incorporating the perspective of children is funda - mental , the process of involving them in research should be careful through and through . As a parent , I consider that my children have benefited from this autoethnographic study , but that is no guaran - tee that further studies would have the same result . My children learnt about and had the opportunity to discuss robots with me , and expanded on their knowledge of technology in a critical manner , but this relied heavily on my own consistent and situated under - standing of the ethical approach accepted within our family . The inclusion of children in research and design processes has a long history , and their influence in the development of robotics and AI along with their own understanding of the technology should be encouraged [ 46 ] . This paper contributes to the discussion from a micro - ethics perspective [ 42 ] , as autoethnography leads into a great number of smaller exchanges . Many of the interactions that emerged in our home ( e . g . the exclusion of the younger child when the older is interacting with the drone ) could have easily been missed or ignored in larger and more representative studies . While generalisation is not the aim , nor can it be achieved through this method , the conclusions offered are still of great relevance to the re - search community . Autoethnography offers a strong and important methodological contribution to the field , as the changes ( from dis - ruptive to positive ) between different parts of the micro - StS ought to be considered in research , the design process , and definitely in the development of regulation for drones . 6 CONCLUSION As drones become more prevalent in our society , younger children will have contact with them in one form or another . Studying child - drone interaction is a worthwhile endeavour , but it does bring a set of difficulties . Drones can be dangerous , and are robots with a set of characteristics that definitely make contact between them and younger children a potential hazard . Simultaneously , their capacity to capture attention and their novelty opens up for critical approaches . Now is the time to tackle these issues . To understand the role of this technology in a domestic context , particularly in relationship to small children , I engaged in a year - long autoethnographic study with my family and my two children ( aged 3 and 6 ) . We progressively learned how to live with different robots at home , and absorbed attitudes towards these from each other . Autoethnography is a difficult method to apply , as it involves a deeply personal engagement both with the research but also with its participants . To aid in making sense of the emerging relation - ships , I introduce the combined use of a socio - technical systems ( StS ) approach and framework with autoethnography , representing this study as a set of different components and relationships which complement the existing methodology . The framing of the family as a micro - StS was helpful in supporting the analysis of the data and extracting design knowledge to be considered for the RtD of drone probes for this context , as well as developing and describing these tacit narratives to a reader . More work in making autoethnography a relevant method for RtD is needed , but in this paper , I present a set of narratives and design opportunities which can be made useful by other researchers in the field to support a more nuanced and Living with Drones , Robots , and Young Children : Informing Research through Design with Autoethnography NordiCHI ’22 , October 8 – 12 , 2022 , Aarhus , Denmark critical approach to child - drone interaction . They have , in many ways , already made a dramatic impact in my own understanding of this design space .
