Quate , Stanford University , Stanford , CA , and approved March 21 , 2005 ( received for review February 11 , 2005 ) Multicellular microbial communities are the predominant form of existence for microorganisms in nature . As one of the most prim - itive social organisms , Myxococcus xanthus has been an ideal model bacterium for studying intercellular interaction and multi - cellular organization . Through previous genetic and EM studies , various extracellular appendages and matrix components have been found to be involved in the social behavior of M . xanthus , but none of them was directly visualized and analyzed under native conditions . Here , we used atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) imaging and in vivo force spectroscopy to characterize these cellular struc - tures under native conditions . AFM imaging revealed morpholog - ical details on the extracellular ultrastructures at an unprecedented resolution , and in vivo force spectroscopy of live cells in ﬂuid allowed us to nanomechanically characterize extracellular poly - meric substances . The ﬁndings provide the basis for AFM as a useful tool for investigating microbial - surface ultrastructures and nanomechanical properties under native conditions . force spectroscopy (cid:2) nonomechanics (cid:2) bacteria (cid:2) swarm B acteria live mainly as single - or multispecies multicellular communities ( 1 , 2 ) , usually assuming the form of surface - associated cell assemblages , or biofilms ( 3 – 5 ) . Intercellular com - munication and concerted multicellular activities , through which the cells can differentiate and produce spatially organized struc - tures , are common within microbial communities ( refs . 6 – 8 and reviewed in ref . 2 ) . An important component of these structures is the matrix , formed by extracellular polymeric substances , which plays a critical role in collective motility . Extensive cell – cell and cell – matrix interaction is essential to the building and maintaining of the microcommunities , and these interactions have been re - vealed in detail with scanning EM ( SEM ) ( e . g . , refs . 9 and 10 ) . However , despite the high resolution that EM can achieve , the extensive sample processing involved limits its application in visu - alization under physiological conditions . One of the best - studied social bacteria , Myxococcus xanthus , has been an excellent model system for investigating the intercellular interaction and multicellular organizations in microbial communi - ties . When nutrients are available , M . xanthus forms swarms and cooperatively pools extracellular digestive enzymes to prey on other bacteria ( 11 , 12 ) . When the food supply runs low , cells initiate a complex developmental program that leads to the formation of dome - like structures called fruiting bodies , inside which individual cells undergo sporulation ( 13 ) . A key characteristic in both M . xanthus vegetative swarming and developmental aggregation is large - scale coordinated motion , which is realized through social ( S ) gliding motility ( 14 , 15 ) . Genetic and behavioral analyses revealed that S motility requires at least three major cellular components : type IV pili ( TFP ) , extracellular fibril material , and LPS O antigen ( 16 – 18 ) . The role of LPS O antigen in S motility remains elusive ( 18 ) , but both TFP and fibril material have been studied in greater detail . M . xanthus TFP were seen under EM as polar filaments measuring 5 – 7 nm in diameter and 4 – 10 (cid:1) m in length ( 19 ) . Previous studies have revealed that TFP - dependent surface motilities are achieved through TFP ex - tension and attachment to an external substrate followed by re - traction , which pulls the cells forward ( 20 – 22 ) . Extracellular fibril material has been visualized under SEM as 30 - to 50 - nm - thick intercellular fibers ( 23 ) that form a mesh - like network surrounding the cell body ( 24 ) . Because mutants lacking fibril material are unable to agglutinate in liquid suspension , it was hypothesized that cohesion is the major role of fibril material ( 23 ) . Biochemical analysis suggested that fibril material is composed of approximately equal amounts of protein and carbohydrate ( 25 ) . A recent study indicated that , in addition to mere cohesion , the amine - containing polysaccharide of the fibril material may function to trigger pilus retraction ( 26 ) , providing another perspective on the role of fibril material in S motility . Despite extensive genetic and functional studies , neither TFP nor fibril material had been imaged under native conditions . Although the social behaviors of M . xanthus have been investigated in detail , its cellular organization in a social group had never been revealed under physiological conditions at high resolution . In this study , we used atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) ( 59 ) to visualize the cellular ultrastructures as well as social swarming groups of M . xanthus , revealing their morphological details under native conditions at an unprecedented resolution . By imaging a panel of M . xanthus mutants ( Table 1 ) , we were able to correlate nanoscale morphology and nanomechanical characterization of the cell wall properties with the mutants’ genetic backgrounds , demonstrating the quanti - fiable phenotypic differences among the M . xanthus mutants . Through AFM imaging and in vivo force spectroscopy , we were also abletoperformnanomechanicalcharacterizationofthecellsurfaceandextracellularpolymericsubstancesonlive M . xanthus cells . These results revealed the elasticity of the M . xanthus surface and the mechanical nature of the adhesion mediated by fibril material ; the latter provided nanomechanical evidence for the role of extra - cellular polysaccharides in cellular cohesion and the social behav - iors of M . xanthus . Materials and Methods Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions . The M . xanthus strains used were DK1622 ( wild type ) ( 19 ) , DK10407 ( pilA , pilus (cid:1) ) ( strain supplied by D .

Cell Immobilization . For imaging in air , logarithmic - phase M . xan - thus cells were collected by centrifugation at 6 , 000 (cid:5) g for 5 min , washed in Mops buffer ( 10 mM Mops (cid:3) 4 mM MgSO 4 , pH 7 . 6 ) , and resuspended to 1 (cid:5) 10 7 cells per ml in the same buffer . A 12 - well Cel - Line glass slide ( Erie Scientific , Portsmouth , NH ) was cleaned with 75 % ethanol and wiped dry with lens paper . Resuspended M . xanthus cells ( 20 (cid:1) l ) were added to one well for 30 min , and excess liquid was removed with filter paper . The slide was then air - dried before imaging . To image cell groups , cells were resuspended to 1 (cid:5) 10 8 cells per ml and prepared as above ; a wash step was added after the 30 - min incubation to remove the unattached cells . For imaging in fluid , samples were prepared as described in ref . 29 , withslightmodifications . An18 - (cid:5) 18 - mmcoverslipwascleaned with 75 % ethanol . A drop of 1 % polyethyleneimine ( PEI ) ( M r 1 , 200 ) dissolved in deionized water was placed on one side of the glass and allowed to adsorb for 3 h , after which the drop was decanted , and the coverslip was rinsed in water and air - dried . Logarithmic - phase M . xanthus cellswerecollectedbycentrifugation at 6 , 000 (cid:5) g for 5 min , washed with PBS ( pH 7 . 4 ) , and resuspended to 10 9 cells per ml . For fixing , the cells were stirred in 2 . 5 % ( vol (cid:3) vol ) glutaraldehyde for 2 h at 4°C , rinsed , and resuspended in 1 mM Tris ( pH 7 . 5 ) . One drop of the cell suspension ( with or without fixing ) was placed on a PEI - coated coverslip and placed in a CentriVap concentrator ( Labconco , Kansas City , MO ) ( without spinning ) for 20 – 30 min at 35°C to evaporate excess water without drying the cells . The coverslip was then adhered to a Petri dish and submerged in deionized water for AFM imaging . After imaging , cell viability was verified by streaking the M . xanthus cells on a CYE agar plate and checking growth after 24 h . AFM . All imaging in air and fluid was carried out with a Nanoscope IV Bioscope ( Veeco Digital Instruments , Santa Barbara , CA ) . Oxide - sharpened cantilevers ( OTR4 , Olympus , Tokyo ) with spring constants of 0 . 02 N (cid:3) m and a tip radius of (cid:6) 10 nm were used in contact mode . Fluid imaging and mechanical measurements were performed at room temperature . All force measurements were recorded at a pulling rate of 1 Hz . ‘‘Height’’ and ‘‘deflection’’ images were simultaneously recorded . Deflection images do not represent the true topography of the sample ; however , they con - sistently revealed a higher sensitivity to small surface features and yielded images with greater detail ( 30 ) . Images presented in this study are deflection images , but the quantitative measurements of cell structures were taken from the height data on the same sample . Results M . xanthus Cell Organization in a Social Group . Actively growing wild - type M . xanthus cells ( DK1622 ) were dotted at various con - centrations on glass slides and allowed to settle for 30 min ( see Materials and Methods for details ) . The samples were washed several times to remove the unattached cells , air dried , and imaged under AFM in contact mode . As shown in Fig . 1 A , attached cells were seen as large mound - like cell packs , and aligned individual cells were found connecting different ‘‘mounds . ’’ When we zoomed in on the edge of a cell mound , where cells were in a single layer , the cell alignment and organization were clearly seen ( Fig . 1 B ) . Individual cells measured (cid:7) 5 (cid:1) m long ( sometimes as long as 10 (cid:1) m ) and (cid:7) 800 nm wide . When a higher - resolution image was taken on the edge of the cell group , pili were clearly seen at the cell poles ( arrows , Fig . 1 C ) . Cell - Surface Ultrastructures . Wild type and S - motility mutants were imaged in air to examine their cellular ultrastructures . A lower concentration of actively growing M . xanthus cells was dotted directly from liquid culture onto glass slides . As described in Table 1 , many S - motility mutants are defective in certain extracellular structures . The pilA mutant lacks pili , the dif mutant lacks fibril material and has been reported to be overpiliated ( 26 ) , the stk mutant overproduces fibril material , and the LPS O antigen mutant lacks LPS O antigen ( a component of the outer cell wall ) . To examine the effects of these genetic mutations on nanoscale surface morphology under native conditions , we harvested the cells from actively growing cultures , air - dried , and imaged directly with AFM ( see Materials and Methods ) . PolarTFP . As shown in Fig . 1 D , TFP filaments measuring (cid:7) 4 – 6 (cid:1) m in length and 5 – 8 nm in diameter could be clearly seen at the cell poles of wild - type strain DK1622 , whereas the filaments were missing from the pilA mutant ( Fig . 1 F ) . The filaments extended from the cell pole and spread out from the long axis of the cell , with a slight curve in all filaments . This native pili morphology is rather different from that seen in EM micrographs , where pili appeared as randomly arranged fibers ( 19 ) . It is interesting to note that cells adjacent to each other often have pili at the same end ( Fig . 1 D ) . Because little sample preparation was involved for AFM imaging , this observation suggested that cells in close proximity to each other may coordinate their pili - shooting direction . Overpiliation has been reported in the dif mutants that lack extracellular fibril material ( 26 ) . When a dif mutant , SW504 ( (cid:2) difA ) , was examined under AFM , the cells did display longer pili at cell poles ( Fig . 1 G ) . Notably , the pili morphology in the dif mutant also appeared to be different from that of the wild - type cells , with the majority bending backwards toward the cell body instead of shooting forward as in the wild type ( Fig . 1 G ) . It has been reported that pili in dif mutants fail to retract , leading to the overpiliation phenotype and S - motility defect ( 26 ) . The pili mor - phology observed here might be a result of the pili overextension and may correlate with the defective pili function in the S motility in dif mutants . Extracellularpolysaccharidematrix . The dif mutants lack extracellular fibril material . SEM observations had originally defined ‘‘fibrils’’ as a matrix material consisting of branching extensions (cid:7) 30 nm in diameter that surrounds the wild - type cells ( 23 , 24 ) . Later studies revealed that these fibrils likely form a mesh of extracellular polymeric substances over the entire cell body ( 25 , 31 ) . When wild - type M . xanthus cells were examined by using AFM , no filamentous structures were seen on the cell body ( Fig . 1 D and E ) . Table 1 .

( i ) The cell surfaces appeared rather ‘‘rough , ’’ as shown in Fig . 1 D , and ( ii ) slime - like structures were often seen covering or extending from the cell body , as shown in Fig . 1 E . The dif mutant , however , appeared much ‘‘smoother’’ ( Fig . 1 G ) . To quantify the visual differences , a roughness analysis of the cellular surfaces was carried out . As detailed in Supporting Text , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site , we define roughness ( R ) as the standard deviation of the height values ( h ) away from the mean height ( h 0 ) of a given scan line over the cell surface ( see Fig . 4 , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site ) . The R rms for the wild - type and pilA cells were determined to be 4 . 30 (cid:8) 1 . 09 nm and 3 . 43 (cid:8) 0 . 91 nm , respec - tively . However , the dif mutant displayed much less roughness ( 2 . 54 (cid:8) 0 . 77 nm ) . The M . xanthus stk mutants are known to have constitutively high polysaccharide production and a higher - than - normal level of fibril material ( 28 , 32 ) . When this mutant ( DK3088 ) was examined under AFM , an excessive amount of slime - like substances were seen on the cell surface , and long filamentous structures were often found extendingfromthecellbody ( Fig . 1 H ) . The stk mutantswereknown to exhibit a variety of properties including the clumping of cells during growth in liquid culture , rapid agglutination , and the for - mation of colonies in which cells adhere tightly to each other and the agar surface ( 28 ) . The striking amount of extracellular sub - stances observed under physiological conditions provided the struc - tural basis for these phenotypes . The surface roughness of the stk mutant was also measured and averaged 7 . 16 (cid:8) 2 . 74 nm , signifi - cantly higher than that of wild - type cells ( 4 . 30 (cid:8) 1 . 09 nm ) . Another important type of extracellular polysaccharide in M . xanthus is LPS . M . xanthus LPS is typical of Gram - negative bacteria and consists of lipid A , which forms the outer leaflet of the outer membrane bilayer ; core , which is a chain of carbohydrates attached to lipid A ; and O antigen , which contains a variable number of repeating oligosaccharide units and extends outward from the core ( 33 ) . Genetic studies showed that the wzm wzt wbgA genes in the sasA locus of M . xanthus encode LPS O antigen biogenesis proteins , and the LPS O antigen mutant ( HK1324 , (cid:2) wzm wzt wbgA ) was defective in S motility ( 18 ) . When this mutant was imaged with AFM , it exhibited a relatively ‘‘clean’’ cell surface ( Fig . 1 I ) as compared with wild type . The cell - surface roughness of the mutant was quantified and averaged 4 . 05 (cid:8) 1 . 42 nm , comparable to that of wild - type cell surface . This finding is expected because LPS O antigen mutants exhibit a wild - type level of extracellular fibril material ( 18 ) , which presumably masks the cell wall and contributes to a wild - type - like cell - surface roughness .

Aside from the ultrastructure imaging , some unique cell morphology was also observed . As shown in Fig . 2 A , M . xanthus cells were occasionally seen curling their cell bodies and twisting about each other , leading to a braid - like morphology . Bending and flexing of the cell body was often seen in M . xanthus cells and was believed to be a means for directional change during gliding ( 34 ) . The formation observed here suggested that adjacent cells can somehow coordinate their flexing to twist around each other . Interestingly , when examined at a higher resolution , extend - ing pili could be seen at the same cell pole of both twisted cells ( Fig . 2 B ) , demonstrating again that pili on adjacent cells tend to shoot from the same cell ends . Another noteworthy observation involves individual cell mor - phology . Earlier studies using shock - freezing and SEM revealed motility - associated surface patterns in gliding M . xanthus ( 35 ) . The cells appeared to be ‘‘rotated’’ along the long axis of the cell , and the rotation patterns were lost in sodium - azide - treated cells , sug - gesting that the rotation was associated with active gliding ( 35 ) . Under AFM , similar patterns were observed ( Fig . 2 C ) . Individual cells were seen to be twisted along their long axis , with a helical surface fold running through the cell body . A height profile of the twisted cell body revealed (cid:7) 25 - to 100 - nm ‘‘peaks’’ separated by (cid:7) 500 - nm ‘‘valleys’’ on the helical patterns along the cell axis ( Fig . 2 C ) , comparable to the patterns obtained by Lunsdorf et al . ( 35 ) ( 600 - to 1 , 000 - nm separations ) . When the cells were treated with 0 . 02 % sodium azide for 10 min , no twisting was seen in the entire sample ( data not shown ) , demonstrating that these morphological changes were correlated with active gliding , rather than represent - ing a drying artifact . Local Elasticity of Live M . xanthus Cells in Fluid . The ability of M . xanthus to flex and twist its cell body suggests the high level of flexibility in live M . xanthus cells . Because of its force - spectroscopy capacity , AFM allows the investigation of cell local flexibility or elasticity that is unattainable with any other imaging tools . Wild - type M . xanthus cells were immobilized on a glass coverslip , submerged in fluid ( see Materials and Methods ) , and probed with AFM . In contrast to imaging in air , the scanning of the AFM tip in fluid caused slight movements of the cell bodies that compromised image quality ( see Fig . 5 , which is published as supporting infor - mation on the PNAS web site ) . However , these cells were stable enough to be isolated and used for the determination of the local cell - wall elasticity or ‘‘stiffness’’ ( Young’s modulus , E ) by measuring force curves ( Fig . 3 A and Supporting Text ) on the cell ( 36 ) . As detailed in Supporting Text , E can be determined by converting force – displacement curves ( Fig . 3 A ) into force – indentation curves obtained on stable areas of cell surfaces ( Fig . 6 , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site ) . Based on these curves , wild - type cells were found to have a local Young’s modulus of 0 . 25 (cid:8) 0 . 18 million pascals ( MPa ) ( see Supporting Text for calculationdetails ) . Afterglutaraldehydefixation ( see Materialsand Methods ) , wild - type cells displayed an E of 1 . 34 (cid:8) 0 . 66 MPa , demonstrating a significant change in cell - surface elasticity upon glutaraldehyde treatment . Although measurements of bacterial turgor pressure and local spring constants have been reported in refs . 37 – 39 , very little is known about the Young’s modulus of bacterial cell walls , and the AFM measurement of E on a living bacterium in aqueous condi - tions has not been previously reported . Studies using ‘‘bacteria threads’’ have estimated E on ‘‘wet’’ Bacillus subtilis at (cid:7) 30 MPa ( 40 ) , 100 times higher that the values we obtained with AFM on unfixed M . xanthus in aqueous conditions . AFM has been used to measure the Young’s modulus on yeast cells ( averaging (cid:7) 1 MPa ) ( 36 , 41 ) and mammalian cells , which have highly variable and spatially dependent E , and usually falls in the 1 - to 200 - kPa range ( 42 – 45 ) . The E value we obtained on wild - type M . xanthus cells therefore reflects the relative stiffness of the M . xanthus cell wall as compared with other organisms . InVivo Force Spectroscopy of Extracellular Fibrils on the M . xanthus Cell Surface . Contact - mediated cell – cell interactions are an impor - tant aspect of the social behavior of M . xanthus and are facilitated by extracellular fibril material that exists on the surface of the cells ( 17 , 23 , 24 ) . The force - spectroscopy capacity of AFM allows us to investigatethenanomechanicalpropertiesofthe M . xanthus surface adhesive molecules . Wild - type cells were immobilized in liquid as described above , and force – displacement curves were measured on the cell by lowering the tip and pressing it against the cell surface with a force of (cid:7) 10 nN . Upon tip retraction , a sequence of rupture events occurred at distances of 1 – 3 (cid:1) m , presumably arising from the breakage of multiple adhesions between the AFM tip and the cell - surface substances ( Fig . 3 A ) . The cantilever displacement always returned to its initial zero position after the series of rupture events . Similar retraction curves have been reported for other adhesive polymers ( DNA , proteins , and polysaccharides ) ( 46 – 49 ) , suggesting that the adhesive substances on the M . xanthus cell surface were extracellular polymeric molecules . Wild - type cells fixed with glutaraldehyde , which cross - links the extracellular poly - Fig . 2 . The twisting morphology of M . xanthus cells . ( A ) Two cells twisted around each other .

Force curves were also measured on bare substrate , before and after measurement on the cell , confirming that there was no contamination on the AFM tip that may have caused nonspecific adhesion between the tip and the cell surface ( Fig . 3 B ) . Therefore , we ascribe the adhesion events to the stretching of extracellular polymeric substances with the AFM tip . The average adhesion force of each rupture event is (cid:7) 2 . 5 nN , significantly greater than forces obtained on most other microbial surfaces ( (cid:7) 20 – 900 pN ) ( 50 , 51 ) , suggesting the high degree of surface adhesiveness in this social bacterium . The stk mutants were examined under the same conditions and exhibited a greater number of major adhesions ( one to nine events ) compared with the wild type ( one to three events ) . However , both cell types exhibit a similar average adhesion force ( Fig . 3 A ) , indicating that the fibril material from both strains is similar in its chemical adhesion properties . More than 100 measurements were made on each cell type for the force - spectroscopy study . The adhesion events on the stk mutant occurred after the tip was retracted more than 1 (cid:1) m , whereas wild - type adhesion events usually ceased after (cid:7) 1 (cid:1) m of tip retraction ( Fig . 3 A ) . Although the measured retraction length is partly determined by where the tip contacts the fibril , stk cells still display a 50 – 80 % longer retraction length than do the wild type , indicating that the fibril - material molecules on the stk mutant are longer , in general , than those of the wild - type cells . These obser - vations are consistent with the fibril - overproducing phenotype of the stk mutant and the morphological features observed by using AFM ( Fig . 1 H ) . These in vivo systems are complex and very different from the idealized systems presented in previous polysaccharide force - spectroscopy studies ( 52 , 53 ) . In an artificial system , the concen - tration of polysaccharide on a surface can be precisely controlled so that only one polysaccharide filament can be pulled for each force - spectroscopy measurement . On a cell surface , however , this precision is impossible to achieve . Fibril material forms a complex mesh - like structure that has not been precisely determined , but the transient and local contact between an AFM tip and a cell surface is a reasonable model for examining the adhesive property of the M . xanthus cell surface . Discussion In this study , we achieved high - resolution AFM imaging of the socialbacterium M . xanthus , revealingnotonlythecellcoordination and organization in a social gliding group ( Fig . 1 A – C ) but also the morphological details of extracellular ultrastructures ( TFP and extracellular substances ) ( Fig . 1 D and E ) under native conditions and at a resolution comparable to EM . Three noteworthy obser - vations were made during imaging . ( i ) Pili , the S - motility motor , were seen on the same pole of a group of active cells ( considering the minimal sample preparation before imaging ) ( Fig . 1 D ) , reveal - ing that pili on adjacent gliding cells may coordinate shooting direction as a means to concert S motility . ( ii ) Roughness analysis on a variety of mutants with altered extracellular polysaccharide production was performed and clearly correlated the changes in surface topology with the genetic defects , allowing quantitative morphological characterization of the extracellular polysaccharide mutants . ( iii ) Individual M . xanthus cells with helical surface patterns obviously related to gliding were seen ( Fig . 2 ) , confirming the earlier discoveries made through SEM ( 35 ) and suggesting that gliding motility is correlated with helical twisting along the long axis of the cell body . In addition to high - resolution imaging , the mechanical properties and surface features of M . xanthus cells were investigated with AFM in aqueous conditions . The local modulus of elasticity ( Young’s modulus , E ) , which averaged 0 . 25 MPa , was determined for live M . xanthus cells . This E value falls between that of yeast cells ( (cid:7) 1 MPa ) ( 36 , 41 ) and mammalian cells ( (cid:7) 1 – 200 kPa ) , measured with AFM ( 42 – 45 ) . AFM measurements are innately local and deal with mechanical properties of the cell at the nanoscale . Therefore , the AFM results indicate the mechanical properties of the samples at local scales . The relatively small value of E for M . xanthus provided mechanical evidence for the often observed flexing of the cell body ( Fig . 2 ) ( 34 ) and for the helical twisting observed on gliding cells ( Fig . 2 ) ( 35 ) . When the mechanism of adventurous ( A ) motility was investigated , it was proposed that slime - hydration extrusion powers cellular movement ( 54 ) . The flexible cell surface will , therefore , allow such processes to take place and accommodates this hypothesis . The unique ability of AFM to operate in fluid enables us to perform in vivo force spectroscopy on M . xanthus cell - surface molecules . Single - molecule force spectroscopy ( SMFS ) has been widely used on well defined monolayers of structurally character - ized molecules ( 48 , 55 , 56 ) . However , except for a few reports ( 57 , 58 ) , little SMFS study has been carried out on living systems , which display much higher morphological heterogeneity . Here , we re - ported SMFS analysis of the extracellular substances on wild - type Fig . 3 . Force – displacement curves . ( A ) Force curves measured on living wild - type ( curve i ) , stk ( curve ii ) , and glutaraldehyde - ﬁxed wild - type M . xan - thus ( curveiii ) cells ( thecurvesareshifted4nNforclarity ) . Force – displacement curves were recorded as ‘‘approach’’ ( red ) and ‘‘retraction’’ ( blue ) curves . During the approach curve , the force acting on the AFM cantilever was recorded as a function of the displacement of the piezoelectric crystal , which moves the cantilever toward the sample . The force acting on the cantilever remains at zero as long as the AFM cantilever is not in contact with a surface , andtheforceincreasesmonotonicallyaftercontact .

As the predominant form of existence for microorganisms in nature , the microbial communities and biofilms have not been studied under native conditions at resolutions comparable to EM . Results from this study demonstrated the capacity of AFM in studying the social bacteria M . xanthus and serve as a good example for further studies on other microbial communities . The minimal sample preparation involved in AFM allows direct high - resolution imaging on individual cells as well as on microbial communities under native conditions , and the force sensitivity of AFM enables nanomechanical study of cell - surface properties , including cellular elasticity , the nature of adhesive molecules , adhesion forces , etc . The combination of these capacities makes AFM a powerful tool for investigating the morphological and nanomechanical details of microbial communities and biofilms that will greatly enhance our understanding of the biological nature of the microbial world .
