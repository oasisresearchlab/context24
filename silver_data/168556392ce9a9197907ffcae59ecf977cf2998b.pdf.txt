The cells were treated with three bioactive compounds with proven beneﬁcial effects in the therapy of patients with VV , diosmin , escin , and bromelain . Two concentrations of tested drugs were used ( 1 , 10 mg / mL ) , which did not affect the viability of either cell type . Escin led to a slight generation of reactive oxygen species in HUVEC cells . We observed a slight release of superoxide in HVVEC cells upon treatment with diosmin and escin . Diosmin and bromelain showed a tendency to release nitric oxide in HUVEC . Using membrane ﬂuorescent probes , we demonstrated a reduced ﬂuidity of HVVEC , which may lead to their increased adhesion , and , consequently , a much more frequent occurrence of venous thrombosis . For the ﬁrst time , we show the mechanism of action of drugs used in VV therapy on endothelial cells derived from a VV . Studies with HVVEC have shown that tested drugs may lead to a reduction in the adhesive properties of these cells , and thus to a lower risk of thrombosis . Keywords : varicose vein ; human endothelial cells ; diosmin ; escin ; bromelain 1 . Introduction Varicose veins ( VV ) are swollen , twisted blood vessels that appear under the surface of the skin in the form of blue and purple bulges , most often in the lower limbs . Varicose veins are the result of blood stagnation , or slow or turbulent venous blood ﬂow in the vessels when their walls are weak and the valves are not working properly . They cause swelling of the lower limbs , hyperpigmentation of the skin , and , in more severe cases , chronic venous ulcers and a high risk of venous thrombosis . Some of the symptoms associated with varicose veins can be relieved with medication , sclerotherapy , laser therapy , or surgery . Occasionally , in cases of severe varicose veins , blood clot formation may become a serious health problem , leading to venous thrombosis [ 1 ] . Varicose veins are common and occur in approximately 35 % of US adults in the general population [ 2 ] . In turn , in the United Kingdom , it is estimated that patients with VV constitute 40 % of the total population [ 3 ] . Varicose veins are the result of many factors , such as the age of patients , aging pro - cesses , overweight , poor physical condition , and a standing lifestyle . Varicose veins are changed , weakened veins and are the symptom of chronic venous insufﬁciency . As hydro - static blood pressure increases , the vein becomes enlarged and the valves that keep the blood moving in one direction stop working properly , leading to stagnation and hypoxia . Under low oxygen conditions , many factors are expressed , such as hypoxia inducible Biomedicines 2023 , 11 , 1702 . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 3390 / biomedicines11061702 https : / / www . mdpi . com / journal / biomedicines Biomedicines 2023 , 11 , 1702 2 of 20 factors ( HIF - 1 , HIF - 2 ) , but also matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) inducers or activators , for example , the matrix metalloproteinase inducer . The activities of the matrix metallopro - teinases cause inﬂammation and damage to endothelial cells covering the lumen of the vessel , and the appearance of structural and functional changes in the vein wall [ 4 ] . The inﬂuence of MMPs on the degradation of the extracellular matrix has also been demon - strated , which in turn causes a signiﬁcant remodeling of the venous tissue , leading to structural and degenerative changes in the vein wall and valve dysfunction . The MMPs can also induce early changes in endothelial and venous smooth muscle function and venous dilation . In turn , leukocyte inﬁltration and vein wall inﬂammation further increase the number of MMPs , vein wall dilation , valve degradation , and the further development of chronic venous disease ( CVD ) , including varicose veins [ 5 ] . Studies carried out on cell cultures and ex vivo explants have shown a hypoxia - induced activation of leukocytes and endothelial cells , which secrete mediators involved in the remodeling of the vein wall . Similar mediators are released in the case of varicose veins [ 6 ] . Under hypoxia , venous endothelial cells release greater amounts of HIF , which regulate many genes related to oxygen homeostasis . In hypoxia , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) and endothelial isoforms of nitric oxide synthase ( eNOS ) are ex - pressed , and prostaglandin I2 and cyclooxygenase - 2 ( COX - 2 ) are increased . It was also found that polymorphonuclear nuclear ( PMN ) cells in hypoxia generate large amounts of superoxide and leukotriene B 4 [ 6 ] . Under hypoxic conditions , an increase in xanthine de - hydrogenase ( XD ) and xanthine oxidase ( XO ) activity was observed in cultured pulmonary arterial endothelial ( EC ) cells without a change in the XD / XO ratio . Hypoxia can lead to oxidative and inﬂammatory damage to the endothelium [ 7 ] . It has been shown that reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) play an important role in the pathogenesis of a varicose vein . ROS are released by activated leukocytes ( mainly neutrophils ) , which adhere to endothelial cells on the vessel wall [ 8 , 9 ] . In patients with a VV , a disturbed antioxidant defense mechanism in the blood , a decreased activity of superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) and total antioxidant status in plasma , and the malondialdehyde ( MDA ) release of an oxidative stress marker have been observed [ 9 , 10 ] . A decreased activity of SOD and the total antioxidant status and an increased MDA level were observed in the vein wall in a varicose vein in comparison to a normal vein [ 8 ] . On the other hand , there was an increase in antioxidant defense in the wall of varicose veins and an increase in the SOD activity [ 9 ] . In addition , ROS led to damage to the subendothelial tissue , smooth muscle cell hyperplasia , and an increase in endothelial permeability [ 10 ] . Bromelain is an extract obtained from the pineapple fruit ( Ananas comosus ) , which includes enzymes such as thiol endopeptidases and phosphatases , glucosidases , peroxi - dase , cellulase , and other components such as glycoprotein and protease inhibitors [ 11 , 12 ] . Bromelain has antimicrobial , anticoagulant , antitumor , and anti - inﬂammatory proper - ties [ 11 , 12 ] . This drug can be used in the treatment of many inﬂammatory diseases , cardio - vascular diseases , coagulation and ﬁbrinolysis disorders , infectious diseases , neoplastic diseases , and in oral surgery [ 13 ] . Bromelain is effective in reducing the development of inﬂammation and swelling . It was recently shown that bromelain can be effectively used in patients undergoing alveolar preservation surgery after tooth extraction [ 14 ] . However , the molecular mechanism of bromelain remains unclear . Escin is a mixture of saponin found in horse chestnut seeds ( Aesculus hippocastanum L . , Sapindaceae ) containing cryptoescin , α - escin , and β - escin isomers that have antioxidant properties [ 15 ] . It exerts an anti - inﬂammatory effect , inhibiting the formation of edema , and it restores the elasticity and proper tension of blood vessels , improving blood ﬂow . Escin is used in the treatment of chronic venous insufﬁciency of the lower extremities and thrombophlebitis in varicose veins or hemorrhoids [ 16 ] . Diosmin belongs to a group of glycosylated ﬂavonoids and was ﬁrst isolated from the plants of the Rutaceae family . It is composed of diosmetin ( aglycone ) and a sugar part , which is the disaccharide 6 - O - α - L - rhamnosyl - D - glucose . This ﬂavonoid , as a phlebotonic drug , is used to improve the condition of the veins with its anti - inﬂammatory and antioxi - Biomedicines 2023 , 11 , 1702 3 of 20 dant properties . It is used in chronic venous insufﬁciency and in varicose veins to slow the progression of the disease . It improves venous tone , reduces the inﬂammatory response and capillary leakage , and improves microcirculation [ 17 ] . This paper compares the effects of plant - derived compounds commonly used in venous diseases , such as diosmin , escin , and bromelain , on the endothelial cells derived from umbilical vein and varicose vein patients ( HUVEC and HVVEC cells ) . The obtained endothelial cells were tested with diosmin , escin , and bromelain for viability , various reactive oxygen species generation , and changes in cell membrane ﬂuidity . 2 .

Chemicals Diosmin ( 3 (cid:48) , 5 , 7 - Trihydroxy - 4 (cid:48) - methoxyflavone 7 - rutinoside ) , escin ( β - D - Glucopyranosyl - ( 1 → 2 ) - [ β - D - glucopyranosyl - ( 1 → 4 ) ] - ( 22 α - ( acetyloxy ) - 16 α , 24 , 28 - trihydroxy - 21 β - { [ ( 2 Z ) - 2 - methylbut - 2 - enoyl ] oxy } olean - 12 - en - 3 β - yl β - D - glucopyranosiduronic acid ) , and brome - lain from a pineapple stem were purchased from Sigma - Aldrich ( St . Louis , MO , USA ) . All the investigated compounds were dissolved according to the suggestions of the manu - facturers . Diosmin was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) ; the ﬁnal concentration of the solvent at the highest concentration did not exceed 0 . 02 % . Escin was dissolved in methanol , and similarly the ﬁnal concentration of the solvent at its highest did not exceed 0 . 02 % . An additional control for solvents at 0 . 02 % concentration was performed . Bromelain was dissolved in PBS . Resazurin , 1 - ( 4 - ( trimethylamino ) phenyl ) - 6 - phenylhexa - 1 , 3 , 5 - triene ( TMA - DPH ) , 11 - ( Dansylamino ) undecanoic acid ( DAUDA ) , 2 (cid:48) , 7 (cid:48) - dichloroﬂuorescin diac - etate ( H 2 DCFDA ) , dihydroethidium ( DHEt ) , and diaminoﬂuorescein - FM ( DAF - FM ) were obtained from Sigma - Aldrich ( St . Louis , MO , USA ) . Sodium salts and other reagents were of the highest available purity and were purchased from POCH ( Gliwice , Poland ) . 2 . 2 . Cell Culture The experiments were conducted on the two types of endothelial cells : human umbili - cal vein endothelial cells ( HUVEC ) and human varicose vein endothelial cells ( HVVEC ) . HUVEC cells were isolated from umbilical cord veins obtained from six healthy volunteers directly after labor . The varicose vein endothelial cells were isolated from varicose veins obtained during surgery from six patients suffering from a chronic venous disease ( sex ( M / F 4 / 2 ) , age ( 54 . 4 ± 10 . 6 years ) , body mass index ( BMI ) ( 27 . 7 ± 3 . 0 kg / m 2 ) ) . The obtained varicose veins were categorized as C 2 E s A 3 P r class using the CEAP classiﬁcation . None of these patients used any phlebotropic drugs or any drugs that could affect the blood coagulation pathways . Both types of the endothelial cells were isolated by collagenase type II ( Gibco , Life technologies , Merelbeke , Belgium ) digestion , according to Jaffe’s protocol [ 18 ] , and used for the experiments at passage 3 – 4 . The cells were cultured in an MCDB131 medium ( Corning B . V . Life Science , Amsterdam , The Netherlands ) containing 10 ng / mL of the epidermal growth factor ( Merck Millipore , Darmstadt , Germany ) , 2 mM glutamine ( Corning B . V . Life Science , Amsterdam , The Netherlands ) , 10 % heat - inactivated fetal bovine serum ( Biowest SAS , Nuaill é , France ) , and antibiotics ( penicillin / streptomycin ) ( Biowest SAS , Nuaill é , France ) . For comparative purposes , Figure 1 presents the microscopic images of the cultured HUVEC and HVVEC cells . The culture flasks were incubated at 37 ◦ C in a 95 % air / 5 % CO 2 atmosphere saturated with H 2 O . The cells were fed twice a week with a complete change of a fresh culture medium . For subculture , the cells were harvested with 0 . 25 % trypsin – ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid sodium salt ( EDTA ) solution ( Biowest SAS , Nuaill é , France ) . The study was conducted in accordance with the rules of the Declaration of Helsinki , and it conformed to the ethical principles set out by the Belmont Report , Ethical Principles and Guidelines for the Protection of Human Subjects of Research .

All partici - pants signed an informed consent form prior to enrolment in the study . 2 . 3 . The Cytotoxicity Test The cytotoxicity of the investigated compounds was estimated spectrophotometri - cally , using a resazurin reduction assay . Resazurin is a blue dye which is reduced by living cells to the pink colored resorufin by cytosolic , mitochondrial , and microsomal redox en - zymes . Dye reduction is highly correlated with the number of viable and metabolically active cells [ 19 ] . The cells were seeded into 96 - well plates at a density of 10 × 10 3 in a 100 μL culture medium per well , 24 h before the experiment , and then they were exposed for 24 h to a range of concentrations from 1 . 25 μg / mL to 50 μg / mL . After the treatment , the cells were washed with phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) , then the resazurin solution was added at a final concentration of 12 . 5 μg / mL , and the plate was returned to the incubator for another 2 h . The absorbances of resazurin and resorufin were measured , respectively , at 570 and 600 nm with a BioTek microplate reader . 2 . 4 . Cell Treatment Conditions The cells were seeded into Petri dishes at a suitable density for the performed assay and incubated for 24 h with diosmin , escin , or bromelain at two concentrations : 1 μg / mL and 10 μg / mL . The control cells were treated with a corresponding volume of PBS , meth - anol , or DMSO ( instead of the investigated compounds ) . After the incubation , the cells were washed with PBS and used for the following measurements . 2 . 5 . Measurement of Reactive Oxygen and Nitrogen Species The measurement of the intracellular ROS and reactive nitrogen species ( RNS ) pro - duction in the endothelial cells was recorded by changes in the fluorescence of three dif - ferent fluorescent probes . The H 2 DCFDA and DHEt are fluorescent probes , which may react with several reactive oxygen species . The cell - permeant H 2 DCFDA passively dif - fuses into the cells , and is retained at the intracellular level after cleavage by intracellular esterases . Upon oxidation by ROS ( including hydrogen peroxide , hydroxyl radicals , and nitrogen dioxide radicals , but also hypochlorous acid and peroxynitrite ) , the Figure 1 .

The Cytotoxicity Test The cytotoxicity of the investigated compounds was estimated spectrophotometrically , using a resazurin reduction assay . Resazurin is a blue dye which is reduced by living cells to the pink colored resoruﬁn by cytosolic , mitochondrial , and microsomal redox enzymes . Dye reduction is highly correlated with the number of viable and metabolically active cells [ 19 ] . The cells were seeded into 96 - well plates at a density of 10 × 10 3 in a 100 µ L culture medium per well , 24 h before the experiment , and then they were exposed for 24 h to a range of concentrations from 1 . 25 µ g / mL to 50 µ g / mL . After the treatment , the cells were washed with phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) , then the resazurin solution was added at a ﬁnal concentration of 12 . 5 µ g / mL , and the plate was returned to the incubator for another 2 h .

The control cells were treated with a corresponding volume of PBS , methanol , or DMSO ( instead of the investigated compounds ) . After the incubation , the cells were washed with PBS and used for the following measurements . 2 . 5 . Measurement of Reactive Oxygen and Nitrogen Species The measurement of the intracellular ROS and reactive nitrogen species ( RNS ) produc - tion in the endothelial cells was recorded by changes in the ﬂuorescence of three different ﬂuorescent probes . The H 2 DCFDA and DHEt are ﬂuorescent probes , which may react with several reactive oxygen species . The cell - permeant H 2 DCFDA passively diffuses into the cells , and is retained at the intracellular level after cleavage by intracellular esterases . Upon oxidation by ROS ( including hydrogen peroxide , hydroxyl radicals , and nitrogen dioxide radicals , but also hypochlorous acid and peroxynitrite ) , the nonﬂuorescent H 2 DCFDA is converted to the highly green ﬂuorescent product 2 (cid:48) , 7 (cid:48) - dichloroﬂuorescein ( DCF ) ( ab - sorption / emission : 504 / 529 nm ) [ 20 ] . DHEt also possesses the ability to freely permeate the cell membranes , and is mainly used to monitor the superoxide production . Dihy - droethidium itself shows a blue ﬂuorescence ( absorption / emission : 370 / 420 nm ) , but , in the cell cytoplasm , it is oxidized by superoxide to 2 - hydroxyethidium , which becomes red ﬂuorescent ( absorption / emission : 535 / 610 nm ) upon DNA intercalation [ 21 ] . The DAF - FM is a cell permeant reagent commonly used to detect and quantify even low concentrations of reactive nitrogen species , especially nitric oxide ( • NO ) . DAF - FM is essentially nonﬂuo - Biomedicines 2023 , 11 , 1702 5 of 20 rescent until it reacts with • NO to form a ﬂuorescent benzotriazole ( absorption / emission : 495 / 515 nm ) [ 22 ] . The ﬁnal concentration of the ﬂuorescent labels in the solution was 5 µ M . The ﬂuorescence intensity was measured with a Cary Eclipse ﬂuorescence spec - trophotometer ( Varian , Inc . , Cary Eclipse , Fluorescence Spectrometer , USA ) , after 30 min of incubation under culture conditions , at the following excitation / emission wavelengths : 504 / 529 nm for H 2 DCFDA , 535 / 610 nm for DHEt , and 495 / 515 nm for DAF - FM . The ﬂuo - rescence intensity was normalized to protein concentrations and expressed as a percentage of the control . 2 . 6 . Measurement of Membrane Fluidity The membrane ﬂuidity of the endothelial cells was monitored by changes in the ﬂuorescence anisotropy of two ﬂuorescent membrane probes , TMA - DPH and DAUDA [ 23 ] . The location of the ﬂuorescent labels in the speciﬁc regions of the cell membrane allows the evaluation of the changes in the ﬂuidity , and the identiﬁcation of the region in which these changes occur . DAUDA was located in the hydrophobic region of the lipid membrane , while the TMA - DPH probe was near the hydrophilic part of the lipid bilayer . An increase in the ﬂuorescence anisotropy of the label is a consequence of a decrease in the membrane ﬂuidity [ 24 ] . The ﬁnal concentration of the ﬂuorescent labels in the solution was 1 µ M . The probe mobilities in the lipid membrane were analyzed after 10 min of incubation under culture conditions at the following excitation / emission wavelengths : 355 / 516 nm for DAUDA , and 355 / 430 nm for TMA - DPH . Fluorescence anisotropy was measured with a Cary Eclipse ﬂuorescence spectrophotometer ( Varian , Inc . ) . 2 . 7 . Statistical Analysis The results represent mean ± standard deviation ( SD ) . The normality of the data was analyzed using the Kolmogorov – Smirnov test , and the homogeneity of variance was tested with a Brown – Forsyth test . The signiﬁcance of the differences between the groups was estimated with a one - way ANOVA and a post hoc Tukey test . The statistical analysis was performed using Statistica v . 13 . 1 ( StatSoft Polska , Krakow , Poland ) . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . Cytotoxicity of the Investigated Compounds The cytotoxicity of bromelain , escin , and diosmin to the endothelial cells in the con - centration range from 1 . 25 µ g / mL to 50 µ g / mL using resazurin was determined . Reduced cell survival was observed after 24 h of cell incubation with diosmin and escin ; however , the cytotoxicity of escin was greater . ( Figure 2A , B ) . In addition , a signiﬁcant reduction in the number of living varicose vein endothelial cells was observed after treatment with escin and diosmin at concentrations ≥ 15 µ g / mL . Diosmin had a slightly greater effect on HUVEC viability than on HVVEC , reducing the cell survival by 15 % and 12 % , respec - tively ( Figure 2A ) . Meanwhile , escin concentrations of 35 µ g / mL and 50 µ g / mL decreased HUVEC and HVVEC viability by approx . 22 % and 30 % ( Figure 2B ) . In case of bromelain , its lower concentration did not affect the human umbilical vein endothelial cell or the vascular endothelial cell survival . The highest concentrations ( 35 µ g / mL and 50 µ g / mL ) of bromelain reduced HUVEC and HVVEC viability by approx . 8 – 10 % . However , these data were not statistically signiﬁcant ( Figure 2C ) . Thus , in further experiments , endothelial cells were treated with diosmin , escin , or bromelain at two concentrations , 1 µ g / mL and 10 µ g / mL , which did not exhibit any inﬂuence on the viability of the two cell types . Additionally , we observed a lack of cytotoxicity in all the solutions used to dissolve the test compounds .

Reactive Oxygen and Nitrogen Species In this work , we also investigated the effect of the plant - derived drugs on the gener - ation of reactive oxygen species in the two types of cells using three ﬂuorescent probes . We measured the total amount of ROS using the H 2 DCFDA probe . It was shown that H 2 DCFDA reacted with superoxide ( O 2 •− ) , hydrogen peroxide ( H 2 O 2 ) , hypochlorous acid ( HClO ) , peroxynitrite ( ONOO − ) , and nitrogen dioxide ( • NO 2 ) [ 25 ] . For the detection of O 2 •− , the selective DHEt probe was used , while the nitric oxide was identiﬁed using the DAF - FM probe . Potentially , ROS could have been released after HUVECs . The varicose vein endothelial cells were incubated with diosmin , escin , and bromelain , and we measured their presence in our study . Generally , it is accepted that diosmin , escin , and bromelain have antioxidant properties . However , we checked the pro - oxidizing nature of these drugs on both types of cells . The cells were exposed to bromelain , diosmin , or escin for 24 h at two concentrations , 1 µ g / mL and 10 µ g / mL , and then the level of ROS was measured . In the case of the HUVEC treated with escin , a slight increase in the ﬂuorescence of H 2 DCFDA was observed ( Figure 3 ) . A slight increase in the ﬂuorescence of this probe was also found for HVVEC treated with bromelain . However , these results were statistically insigniﬁcant .

Cell Membrane Fluidity Changes in the plasma membrane ﬂuidity of human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVEC ) and varicose vein endothelial cells treated with diosmin , escin , and bromelain were investigated using two ﬂuorescent probes located at different depths of the membrane lipid monolayer : TMA - DPH is located in the surface of the lipid membrane , and DAUDA is located in the hydrophobic core [ 23 ] . Comparing the ﬂuorescence anisotropy ( r ) values for both probes , we showed the differences in the membrane ﬂuidity of HUVECs and HVVECs . For the TMA - DPH probe and HUVECs the r was 0 . 280 ± 0 . 014 , and for HVVECs the r was 0 . 297 ± 0 . 03 ( Figure 6 ) . Figure 6 shows an upward trend in the anisotropy for the HUVEC cells treated with diosmin , while the trend for the HVVEC cells was exactly the opposite .

Cell Membrane Fluidity Changes in the plasma membrane fluidity of human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVEC ) and varicose vein endothelial cells treated with diosmin , escin , and bromelain were investigated using two fluorescent probes located at different depths of the mem - brane lipid monolayer : TMA - DPH is located in the surface of the lipid membrane , and DAUDA is located in the hydrophobic core [ 23 ] .

Similar results were obtained for escin and bromelain ; however , these results were statistically insignificant . ( A ) ( B ) ( C ) Figure 6 .

The influence of the tested compounds on the membrane fluidity was also studied using the DAUDA probe located in a deeper region of the lipid bilayer . The differences in the fluorescence anisotropy between HUVEC and HVVEC in the plasma membrane were greater for the DAUDA probe , 0 . 278 ± 0 . 049 and 0 . 320 ± 0 . 030 , respectively ( Figure 7 ) . These results show that HVVEC cells’ plasma membranes are stiffer than those of HU - VEC , and suggest that the investigated compounds can modulate the fluidity of plasma membranes in both cell types .

The results represent mean ± SD of data from six individual experiments for varicose veins and for umbilical veins , each conducted with at least six repeats . The obtained results indicate that the tested compounds did not cause statistically significant changes in the endothelial cell membrane fluidity . No changes were observed for either of the concentrations ( 1 and 10 μg / mL ) . In addition , no change in the fluidity of the membrane of endothelial cells exposed to the tested compounds was observed for both the hydrophilic and the hydrophobic regions of the lipid monolayer . 4 . Discussion Chronic venous disease ( CVD ) is associated with pathological changes in the vein wall as well as with the dysfunction of vein valves . This disease is characterized by the appearance of varicose veins , the hyperpigmentation of lower limb skin , venous leg ul - cers , and skin lesions . The primary stage of CVD is thought to be faulty venous valves causing blood stagnation leading to increased and sustained venous hypertension [ 26 , 27 ] . Vein morphology studies have shown that valve damage is a consequence of the dilatation of the venous wall and the shortening of the valve leaflet , leading to incomplete valve closure and subsequent reflux . In addition , valvular studies showed an increased leuko - cyte infiltration by granulocytes , monocytes , and T cells . The expression of P - selectin and ICAM - 1 , two adhesion molecules on the endothelial cell membrane , was also observed on the endothelial cells of the saphenous vein wall [ 28 ] . Slow blood flow , or blood stagnation in varicose veins , leads to hypoxia and inflam - mation within the vessel wall . Blood samples collected from varicose veins showed an increased concentration of interleukin - 6 , fibrinogen , and hemoglobin in comparison with blood samples from the antecubital vein of the same patient [ 29 ] . Under these conditions , purine metabolism begins with ATP and ends with hypoxanthine and xanthine . However , during the conversion of hypoxanthine to xanthine with the participation of xanthine ox - idase , the superoxide molecule is released . The second O 2•− molecule is released during the oxidation of xanthine to uric acid [ 30 ] . Both oxidative stress and inflammation exist in a varicose vein . It has been reported that hypoxia and cytokines , such as TNF - α , IFN - γ , IL - 6 , and IL - 1 , may activate xanthine oxidoreductase ( XOR ) gene transcription [ 31 , 32 ] . At the same time , the adhesion and activation of neutrophils and monocytes , which addi - tionally release ROS , take place [ 33 , 34 ] . ROS can lead to endothelial dysfunction and the development of atherosclerosis , inflammation , chronic venous insufficiency , and also thrombosis . It has also been shown that endothelial dysfunction plays a crucial role in varicose veins , and deep venous thrombosis ( DVT ) [ 35 ] . f l uo r e sc en c e an i s o t r op y o f D A UD A HU VE C H VVE C 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 c on t r o l d i o s m i n 1  g / m l d i o s m i n 10  g / m l f l uo r e sc en c e an i s o t r op y o f D A UD A HU VE C H VVE C 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 c on t r o l e sc i n 1  g / m l e sc i n 10  g / m l f l uo r e sc en c e an i s o t r op y o f D A UD A HUVEC HVVEC 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 control bromelain 1  g / ml bromelain 10  g / ml Figure 7 .

Discussion Chronic venous disease ( CVD ) is associated with pathological changes in the vein wall as well as with the dysfunction of vein valves . This disease is characterized by the appearance of varicose veins , the hyperpigmentation of lower limb skin , venous leg ulcers , and skin lesions . The primary stage of CVD is thought to be faulty venous valves causing blood stagnation leading to increased and sustained venous hypertension [ 26 , 27 ] . Vein morphology studies have shown that valve damage is a consequence of the dilatation of the venous wall and the shortening of the valve leaﬂet , leading to incomplete valve closure and subsequent reﬂux . In addition , valvular studies showed an increased leukocyte inﬁltration by granulocytes , monocytes , and T cells . The expression of P - selectin and ICAM - 1 , two adhesion molecules on the endothelial cell membrane , was also observed on the endothelial cells of the saphenous vein wall [ 28 ] . Slow blood ﬂow , or blood stagnation in varicose veins , leads to hypoxia and inﬂam - mation within the vessel wall . Blood samples collected from varicose veins showed an increased concentration of interleukin - 6 , ﬁbrinogen , and hemoglobin in comparison with blood samples from the antecubital vein of the same patient [ 29 ] . Under these conditions , purine metabolism begins with ATP and ends with hypoxanthine and xanthine . However , during the conversion of hypoxanthine to xanthine with the participation of xanthine oxidase , the superoxide molecule is released . The second O 2 •− molecule is released during the oxidation of xanthine to uric acid [ 30 ] . Both oxidative stress and inﬂammation exist in a varicose vein . It has been reported that hypoxia and cytokines , such as TNF - α , IFN - γ , IL - 6 , and IL - 1 , may activate xanthine oxidoreductase ( XOR ) gene transcription [ 31 , 32 ] . At the same time , the adhesion and activation of neutrophils and monocytes , which additionally release ROS , take place [ 33 , 34 ] . ROS can lead to endothelial dysfunction and the develop - ment of atherosclerosis , inﬂammation , chronic venous insufﬁciency , and also thrombosis . It has also been shown that endothelial dysfunction plays a crucial role in varicose veins , and deep venous thrombosis ( DVT ) [ 35 ] . Biomedicines 2023 , 11 , 1702 11 of 20 Unstimulated endothelial cells express intercellular adhesion molecules ( ICAM ) . In contrast , E - selectin and vascular cell adhesion molecules ( VCAM ) are present only on activated endothelial cells . In inﬂammation , the cytokines ( TNF - α , IL1 - β and IFN ) acting on endothelial cells can induce the synthesis and expression of E - selectin and VCAM , as well as an increase in the ICAM levels [ 36 ] . Interactions between selectins and their respective ligands are involved in the adhesion of leukocytes to the EC under ﬂow conditions [ 37 ] . Varicose veins are associated with elevated levels of inﬂammatory and prothrombotic markers [ 38 , 39 ] . Inﬂammation is believed to be associated with the pathophysiology of DVT ( deep vein thrombosis ) , PE ( pulmonary embolism ) , and PAD ( peripheral artery disease ) [ 40 ] . The inﬂammation in a varicose vein can also damage the veins , causing blood clots to form . Adult patients with varicose veins are at a signiﬁcantly increased risk of developing a DVT [ 41 ] . It was found that the interactions between blood cells and the vessel wall belong to the main hematological factors determining hemostasis . Plasma factors , red blood cells , leukocytes , and endothelial cells are involved in thrombus formation . In inﬂammation , leukocytes play an important role in endothelial dysfunction , and , consequently , in the changes to the vessel wall , and the increase in coagulation potential through the production of the tissue factor [ 42 ] . 4 . 1 . Endothelial Cells Viability We showed that diosmin and escin concentrations up to 10 µ g / mL did not decrease the viability of the two investigated types of cells . In contrast , higher concentrations of diosmin ( > 35 µ g / mL ) led to a signiﬁcant decrease in the viability of both types of cells , but a higher cytotoxicity was observed for HUVEC than for HVVEC cells . On the other hand , for escin , a greater decrease in cell viability was found at the concentration of 25 µ g / mL . Escin showed higher cytotoxicity to HVVEC than HUVEC cells . Moreover , bromelain showed the lowest cytotoxic effect compared to diosmin and escin . It has been shown that diosmin supports microcirculation , increases venous tone , venous elasticity , and capillary resistance , and reduces capillary ﬁltration and capillary hyperpermeability , and has a beneﬁcial effect on lymphatic drainage [ 43 , 44 ] . Moreover , it also has an anti - inﬂammatory effect and alleviates oxidative stress , and is considered an important drug in the treatment of chronic venous disorders ( CVD ) [ 45 ] . Diosmin is a drug used to treat venous diseases , such as chronic venous insufﬁciency , varicose veins , spider veins , venous ulcers , and leg edema . However , the mechanism of action of diosmin is not deﬁned . In addition to its vasoprotective effects , diosmin has the ability to inﬂuence the production of nitric oxide by the endothelium [ 46 , 47 ] . The antioxidant properties of diosmin , escin , and bromelain , as a factor alleviating oxidative stress initiated by various chemical agents or / and ionizing radiation , have been demonstrated in many studies , both in vivo and in vitro [ 48 – 52 ] . The administration of diosmin to patients suffering from CVD has led to a signiﬁcant reduction in the level of TNF - alpha , vascular endothelial growth factors ( VEGF - A and VEGF - C ) , angiostatin , interleukin 6 ( IL - 6 ) , and ﬁbroblast growth factor 2 ( FGF2 ) , and an increase in plasma angiostatin levels after three months of treatment [ 53 ] . Diosmin has been shown to decrease the survival rate of skin cancer cells ( A431 ) compared to the control . The IC50 determined was 45 µ g / mL [ 54 ] . In many pharmacological studies in animals , diosmin reduced the rolling , adhesion , and migration of leukocytes . In clinical trials , diosmin decreased the expression of mono - cytes or neutrophils , and the endothelial activation markers of the intercellular adhesion molecule 1 ( ICAM - 1 ) and the vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 ( VCAM - 1 ) on human leukocytes in patients with venous ulceration [ 55 ] . Another drug escin is an anti - inﬂammatory drug that reduces swelling and improves blood ﬂow . The pharmacological effect of escin is associated with its anti - edema and anti - inﬂammatory action , effect on the venous tone , and protective effect on the initiation of endothelial damage in hypoxia . In addition , it restores the elasticity and proper tension of blood vessels and increases tissue oxygenation , as well as accelerates the dissolution of blood clots . Due to its positive effect on the vessels , escin is a drug used in the treatment Biomedicines 2023 , 11 , 1702 12 of 20 of chronic venous insufﬁciency including varicose veins . The effect of β - escin sodium up to 40 µ g / mL has been shown to inhibit proliferation and migration but also to initiate apoptosis at the maximum concentration in HUVEC and human umbilical vein endothelial ( ECV304 ) cells [ 56 ] . β - escin - induced cytotoxicity , assessed at the same time as in our study , was observed at concentrations above 4 µ M [ 57 ] . This result revealed that the isolated β - escin isomer may show greater toxicity to endothelial cells than an isomer mixture . Escin led to an increase in the antioxidant potential demonstrated with DPPH and FRAP , as well as to the inactivation of O 2 •− . A signiﬁcant decrease in the viability of A2780 cells was also observed after the treatment with escin . However , it did not cause cytotoxicity to the normal Vero cells ( immortalized cell line established from the kidney epithelial cells of the African green monkey ) [ 58 ] . Recent studies conﬁrm the anti - inﬂammatory properties of escin in decreasing the permeability of blood vessels in inﬂammation , which leads to the inhibition of edema formation . Moreover , it was found that escin prevents hypoxia - induced disturbances in the proper expression and distribution of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule - 1 ( PECAM - 1 ) , which may explain its protective effect on vascular permeability [ 59 ] . Endothelial dysfunction accompanies the pathogenesis of decompression sickness ( DCS ) , and has a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the subsequent inﬂammatory response . It was shown that the administration of escin signiﬁcantly reduced the mortality of rats caused by DCS . In addition , it alleviated endothelial dysfunction , led to a decrease in serum E - selectin and ICAM - 1 , and decreased the level of pro - inﬂammatory cytokines IL - 6 and TNF - α in the serum and MPO , as well as the MDA of the oxidative stress marker [ 60 ] . It was shown that β - escin had an inhibitory effect on proliferation , migration , and tube formation induced by basic ﬁbroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) in HUVEC cells , and that it decreased the viability of concentration - dependent cells in vitro . This saponin also inhibited critical steps in the angiogenic process by β - escin , which may be related to the suppression of the Akt ( protein kinase B ) activation in response to bFGF [ 61 ] . The effect of escin has been studied in glioma and lung adenocarcinoma cell lines , C6 and A549 cells , respectively , as well as the ovarian cell line A2780 cells . This saponin has been shown to have a strong antiproliferative effect on C6 and A549 glioma cells . Escin led to cell cycle arrest in the G0 / G1 phase and an increase in selective apoptotic activity in A549 cells , which is associated with an increase in annexin V binding , bax protein expression , and caspase - 3 activity , but also with observed morphological changes in cells [ 62 ] . Our studies showed that the effect of bromelain on the viability of HUVEC and HVVEC was similar at all tested concentrations . Bromelain showed the lowest cytotoxicity compared to diosmin and escin . Bromelain did not inﬂuence RAW264 . 7 cell viability in concentrations of 10 – 80 µ g / mL [ 63 ] . Our results showed that endothelial cells were more sensitive to bromelain treatment than RAW264 . 7 cells . On the other hand , a strong effect of bromelain on the viability of low cells at concentrations up to 25 µ g / mL was found in the two tumor cell lines : human oral squamous carcinoma ( SCC - 25 ) and Ca9 - 22 , but not in the human keratinocyte HCaT and human gingival ﬁbroblast HGF - 1 lines [ 64 ] . This results conﬁrm that bromelain is more sensitive to tumor cell lines than to normal cell lines . 4 . 2 . Reactive Oxygen and Nitrogen Species Generation The tested drugs , apart from their antioxidant properties , also showed a pro - oxidative effect . In our studies using the H 2 DCF - DA probe , which reacts with many ROS , we found that escin slightly increased the ﬂuorescence in HUVECs . A slight increase in the ﬂu - orescence was also observed in HVVECs following the treatment with bromelain . The generation of ROS using H 2 DCF - DA was also observed in normal and cancer cells follow - ing treatment with diosmin , escin , and bromelain . The excessive release of ROS under the inﬂuence of diosmin has been shown . ROS were the cause of the apoptosis of A431 cells . Diosmin could inhibit cell proliferation through ROS - mediated apoptosis . The apoptotic properties of diosmin were also tested by performing a DNA fragmentation test [ 54 ] . It was shown that an exposure of PMN cells to a mixture containing bromelain ( Wobenzym ) caused a signiﬁcant increase in the release of ROS detected by the chemiluminescence Biomedicines 2023 , 11 , 1702 13 of 20 method . A signiﬁcant increase in the ROS generation was also observed after the adminis - tration of Wobenzym to healthy volunteers [ 65 ] . Moreover , p38 mitogen - activated protein kinases ( MAPKs ) and reactive oxygen species were activated by escin . Escin induced ROS formation in a dose - dependent manner . A p38 MAPK inhibitor partially attenuated the autophagy and apoptosis triggered by escin , but a ROS scavenger showed a greater inhibitory effect in human osteosarcoma cells in vitro and in vivo [ 66 ] . On the other hand , escin led to an increase in the lipid peroxidation and suppressed the SOD activity and glutathione ( GSH ) level in A2780 cells . A drastic increase in ROS generation , and apop - totic cells , following the saponin treatment was also observed . Escin suppressed the p38 MAPK / ERK signaling axis in A2780 cells [ 58 ] . Diosmin induced signiﬁcant ROS generation in tumor cells : human breast cancer cells MCF - 7 , MDA - MB - 231 , and SK - BR - 3 treated with diosmin [ 67 ] . Similar results were found in the prostate cancer cell DU145 [ 68 ] . We also used a DHEt - speciﬁc probe to estimate the superoxide generation . We ob - served a slight increase in the ﬂuorescent intensity in HVVEC after the diosmin and escin treatment , but the differences were statistically insigniﬁcant . Superoxide production was found using the DHEt ﬂuorescent probe after the treatment of human breast cancer cells MCF - 7 , MDA - MB - 231 , and SK - BR - 3 with diosmin [ 67 ] , and also in prostate cancer DU145 [ 68 ] . Escin has been shown to induce apoptosis in human renal cancer cells by producing ROS , which was detected by DHEt [ 69 ] . Superoxide was also found in escin - treated human bladder cancer cells , where ROS induced apoptosis [ 70 ] . On the other hand , the antioxidant effect of diosmin and bromelain was observed in red blood cells . Both compounds induced an increase in total thiols and glutathione , and a decrease in carbonyls . The increase in GSH concentration and the total level of thiol compounds favored the protection of RBCs against oxidative stress [ 71 ] . Another speciﬁc probe for nitric oxide measurement , DAF - FM , showed a slight in - crease in the ﬂuorescence following the diosmin treatment of HUVEC cells . A similar result for this probe was also found in HUVECs after the treatment with bromelain . These results can be indicative of a slight release of • NO in HUVEC cells . However , these results were not statistically signiﬁcant . The production of nitric oxide in tumor cells has been demonstrated , i . e . , in human breast cancer cells MCF - 7 , MDA - MB - 231 , and SK - BR - 3 treated with diosmin using the MitoSOX™ probe [ 67 ] . In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that the administration of bromelain prevents the aggregation of human platelets [ 72 , 73 ] . Fibrinolytic activity has also been demonstrated , as well as the inhibition of thrombus formation [ 74 ] . It was shown that the incubation of platelets with bromelain completely prevented thrombin - induced platelet aggregation . In addition , bromelain decreased the adhesion of thrombin - stimulated platelets to bovine aortic endothelial cells in vitro . In a laser - initiated thrombosis model in rats , orally - administered bromelain inhibited thrombus formation . However , when given intravenously , it was somewhat more effective . These studies also showed that orally administered bromelain is biologically active [ 72 ] . It was reported that bromelain stimulated the inﬂammatory mediators , such as interleukin IL - 1 β , IL - 6 , interferon ( INF - γ ) , and tumor necrosis factor ( TNF - α ) , in mouse macrophage and in human mononuclear cells [ 75 , 76 ] . Another report showed that bromelain can stimulate a healthy immune system in connection with a fast response to cellular stress . On the other hand , bromelain decreases the release of pro - inﬂammatory cytokines in activated immune cells when it occurs during their expression [ 77 , 78 ] . A potent anti - inﬂammatory effect of bromelain has been demonstrated in RAW264 . 7 cells treated with LPS . A reduction in cytokines and inﬂammatory mediators has been observed . Bromelain led to a decreased expression of iNOS and COX - 2 , NF - κ B ( nuclear factor kappa B ) , as well as extracellular signal - regulated kinases and the amino - terminal c - Jun kinase and p38 protein in LPS - treated cells [ 63 ] . Bromelain inhibited the activity of adhesion proteins on the surface of leukocytes responsible for the adhesion and migration of inﬂamed cells . Changes in the protein activity were observed at a concentration of 1 µ g / mL [ 79 ] . Biomedicines 2023 , 11 , 1702 14 of 20 4 . 3 . Cell Membrane Fluidity We also determined the ﬂuidity of the plasma membranes of human umbilical vein endothelial cells and endothelial cells derived from a varicose vein using two ﬂuorescent probes located at different depths of the lipid monolayer of the membrane . By using the TMA - DPH probe , we showed a lower ﬂuidity of the HVVEC membrane than of HUVEC . Even greater differences in the membrane ﬂuidity were observed with the second DAUDA probe , located in the deeper region of the monolayer . These results show a higher stiffness of the HVVEC plasma membranes compared to HUVEC cells . The cell membrane is an organized structure ( lipid bilayer ) composed of phospholipids , proteins , and carbohydrates as a result of lipid – lipid and lipid – protein interactions ; together they create a ﬂuid mosaic . The movement of molecules ( molecular motion ) in the membrane can be monitored with the use of spin probes or ﬂuorescent probes . One of the parameters characterizing the membrane is the ﬂuidity of the membrane , which depends on the chemical structure of phospholipids , including the degree of saturation of fatty acids , as well as the protein – lipid ratio and the presence of cholesterol in the membrane . The plasma membranes have a gradient of ﬂuidity from the water interface with the interior of the bilayer [ 80 , 81 ] . The membrane ﬂexibility is closely related to the transport of the substance across the membranes into and out of the cell , both passive and active [ 82 , 83 ] . The increase in the HVVEC plasma membrane stiffness may be a consequence of the oxidative stress that occurs in a varicose vein . Moreover , the adhesion of leukocytes to the vessel wall may promote additional oxidative stress and the remodeling of the vessel wall . Changes in the structure of VV - derived RBCs may reﬂect changes that occur in other cells derived from the pathological vein , including endothelial cells . A signiﬁcant decrease in the ﬂuidity of the lipid membrane of erythrocytes ( RBC ) derived from varicose veins , in comparison to the antecubital vein , was also observed using spin - labeled 5 - doxylstearic acid ( 5 - DS ) , which is located in the polar region of the lipid layer . In addition , we demonstrated the changes in the structure of the spectrin – actin complex , which is an important component of the membrane cytoskeleton . We also found a decrease in the internal viscosity of RBCs from varicose veins . These changes were accompanied by the greater osmotic sensitivity of RBCs from a varicose vein [ 84 ] . These changes have an inﬂuence on the rheological properties of RBCs , which are related to their deformation when they pass through capillaries in the microcirculation . Rheological properties of cells are determined by the viscosity of the interior , the ﬂuidity of plasma membranes , and the condition of the membrane cytoskeleton . We also found an increased level of oxidative stress in blood derived from a varicose vein compared to blood from an antecubital vein , resulting from a failure of the antioxidant defense system . The observed changes in RBC ( VV ) properties could be caused by the per - manent oxidative stress prevailing in the varicose vein environment . In our previous paper , we compared the antioxidant status of plasma and RBC obtained from peripheral veins and varicose veins in the same patients . We demonstrated a decrease in non - enzymatic antioxidant capacity ( NEAC ) in plasma obtained from varicose veins compared to periph - eral veins . These changes were accompanied by a decrease in the activity of catalase ( CAT ) and acetylcholinesterase ( AChE ) . We observed a decrease in the level of thiols in plasma , hemolysate , and plasma membranes , and an increase in parameters related to oxidative stress , such as the level of protein carbonyl compounds and the level of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances ( TBARS ) in varicose veins [ 85 ] . Diosmin and bromelain reduced the internal viscosity of erythrocytes and led to a signiﬁcant decrease in the mobility of the spin label attached to cytosolic thiols . In addition , a change in hemoglobin conformation was observed at higher diosmin concentrations and for both bromelain concentrations . Both compounds tended to reduce cell membrane ﬂuidity in the subsurface area , but not in deeper areas . A higher concentration of bromelain led to a signiﬁcant decrease in membrane ﬂuidity . In addition , both compounds showed a stabilizing effect on the cell membrane , and improved the rheological properties of RBCs [ 71 ] . Biomedicines 2023 , 11 , 1702 15 of 20 Many studies have shown that membrane ﬂuidity is crucial for the cell adhesion mech - anism [ 86 , 87 ] . Membrane ﬂuidity also has an inﬂuence on cell – cell communication [ 88 , 89 ] . Cell adhesion is optimized by building nanoclusters of ordered lipid rafts that are associated with adhesive complexes [ 90 ] . Lipid rafts are ﬂuid domains heterogeneously distributed throughout the membrane . A more ﬂuid membrane can also help to disperse the lipid rafts quickly , thus reducing adhesions [ 86 , 87 ] . Using the 5 - DS spin probe , it was shown that compared to growing MT3 breast cancer cells , conﬂuent cells had a signiﬁcantly higher membrane ﬂuidity , which was associated with a higher relative proportion of unordered domains , and a smaller proportion of the most ordered domains . The higher ﬂuidity of the membranes led to a lower adhesion of cells to the surface and a higher invasion of these cells [ 91 ] . Both types of cells responded differently to the drug treatment . Diosmin and escin caused an increase in the HVVEC membrane ﬂuidity and a decrease in the HUVEC ﬂuidity in the polar region of the monolayer of the plasma membrane . A similar trend was observed for both types of cells for escin and bromelain in the hydrophobic region membrane . In contrast , diosmin led to a decrease in the membrane ﬂuidity for both HUVEC and HVVEC cells . An in vitro analysis of cellular and molecular responses in human endothelial cells in inﬂammation showed that β - escin strongly induced choles - terol synthesis , which resulted in a decrease in the integrity of the actin cytoskeleton in endothelial cells . As a consequence , there were changes in cell function which caused a signiﬁcantly reduced response to the TNF - α stimulation . These included decreased mi - gration , decreased endothelial monolayer permeability , and the inhibition of NF - κ B signal transduction , leading to a downward expression of TNF - α - induced effector proteins [ 57 ] . This result is consistent with our results because escin led to an increase in the membrane ﬂuidity , which is usually accompanied by an increase in the mobility of the spectrin – actin complex included in the membrane cytoskeleton . In our earlier work , we showed that the decrease in the ﬂuidity of the membrane was correlated with the decrease in the motion of the spin labeled spectrin – actin complex [ 84 ] . It was reported that the pre - incubation of platelets with bromelain , prior to thrombin activation , decreased the platelet adhesion to endothelial cells to a value characteristic of unstimulated platelets [ 72 ] . The obtained results indicate that the tested drugs at the concentrations of 1 and 10 µ g / mL did not induce signiﬁcant changes in the ﬂuidity of the cell membrane at different depths of the monolayer in both types of endothelial cells . These results are consistent with cytotoxicity and reactive oxygen species studies , which showed no deleterious effects of diosmin , escin , and bromelain on endothelial cells . Our ﬁndings suggest that the presented abnormalities in the endothelial plasma membrane may have signiﬁcant pathophysiological implications , including varicose vein thrombosis . The tendency for the membrane ﬂuidity of HVVECs to increase following treatment with diosmin , escin , and bromelain may lead to a lower adhesion of blood cells to the endothelium , and , consequently , to a lower risk of vein thrombosis . 5 . Conclusions We found that a decrease in the ﬂuidity of the endothelial cell membrane in patients with varicose veins may cause increased cell adhesion properties . This may be the reason for a much more frequent occurrence of venous thrombosis in these patients . We demonstrated , for the ﬁrst time , the mechanism of action of anti - varicose drugs ( diosmin , escin , and bromelain ) on endothelial cells derived from a varicose vein .
