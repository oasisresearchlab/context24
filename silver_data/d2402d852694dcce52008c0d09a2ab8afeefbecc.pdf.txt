While the dynamics of canonical focal adhesion 17 complexes ( FAs ) have been extensively studied , the regulation and physiological implications of 18 the recently identified clathrin - containing adhesion complexes ( CCACs ) are still not well 19 understood . In this study , we investigated the spatiotemporal mechanoregulations of FAs and 20 CCACs in a breast cancer model . Employing single - molecule force spectroscopy coupled with 21 live - cell fluorescence microscopy , we discovered that FAs and CCACs are mutually exclusive 22 and inversely regulated complexes . This regulation is orchestrated through the modulation of 23 plasma membrane tension , in combination with distinct modes of actomyosin contractility that 24 can either synergize with or counteract this modulation . Our findings indicate that increased 25 membrane tension promotes the association of CCACs at integrin αVβ5 adhesion sites , leading 26 to decreased cancer cell proliferation , spreading , and migration . Conversely , lower membrane 27 tension promotes the formation of FAs , which correlates with the softer membranes observed in 28 cancer cells , thus potentially facilitating cancer progression . Our research provides novel insights 29 into the biomechanical regulation of CCACs and FAs , revealing their critical and contrasting 30 roles in modulating cancer cell progression . 31 32 33 2 Introduction 34 Cellular adhesion to the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) is a complex , tightly regulated 35 process essential to most cellular functions , such as proliferation , differentiation , and motility ( 1 – 36 3 ) . This adhesion is primarily mediated by membrane bound integrin receptors , which assemble 37 into highly organized structures known as adhesion complexes . These structures integrate signals 38 from both the internal and external environments of the cell , serving as pivotal points for signal 39 transduction ( 4 – 6 ) . Although cells exhibit a variety of integrin - based adhesion complexes with 40 distinct properties and roles ( 5 – 11 ) , the overall interaction between these complexes and their 41 collective influence on cellular behaviors is not fully understood . Investigating the 42 spatiotemporal regulations of adhesion complexes , especially by mechanical cues at the plasma 43 membrane , is crucial for comprehensive understanding of their roles in processes involving 44 extensive membrane remodeling , such as cell proliferation , migration , and differentiation . 45 Focal adhesions ( FAs ) are the most extensively studied integrin - based adhesion 46 complexes that link the ECM and cytoskeleton , playing a critical role in mechanotransduction 47 and cellular dynamics . The dynamic regulation of FAs is influenced by both the chemical and 48 physical properties of the ECM , as well as the contractile forces from actomyosin networks 49 ( 7 , 12 – 17 ) . Different actin structures within cells lead to various contractile behaviors and are 50 responsible for distinct cellular adhesions . Aligned stress fibers , higher - order cytoskeletal 51 structures made of cross - linked actin filaments and myosin motor proteins , induce dipole - like 52 contractility ( 18 , 19 ) . This contractility is key in the assembly and stabilization of FAs . In 53 contrast , cortical actins , which are disordered actomyosin networks beneath the plasma 54 membrane , promote isotropic contraction and support cell - cell adhesion ( 20 – 22 ) . Shifts in actin 55 organization from stress fibers to cortical structures lead to the dissociation of FAs , highlighting 56 the critical balance of actomyosin organization and modes of contractility in FA regulation ( 23 – 57 25 ) . 58 Recent studies revealed a novel class of integrin - based adhesion complexes that are 59 enriched in clathrin ( 26 – 30 ) . In the canonical scheme , clathrin , along with its adaptor proteins , 60 creates curved and dynamic clathrin - coated pits to drive the internalization of membrane 61 components , including FAs , through a process known as clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) 62 ( 31 – 35 ) . However , not all clathrin - coated structures ( CCS ) mature into pits and invaginate ; some 63 3 remain flat and reside on the membrane for long periods of time ( 36 – 40 ) . These remarkably static 64 and larger arrays of CCS are often termed as clathrin - coated plaques , flat clathrin lattices or 65 clathrin sheets and exclusively localized on the ventral / adherent surface of cultured cell ( 29 , 41 ) . 66 Besides their endocytic roles , they are known to have pleiotropic non endocytic functions . For 67 instance , they are observed in close proximity to the substrate and directly associate with 68 integrins and ECM substrates ( 28 , 42 – 49 ) , indicating their putative role in cell adhesion . 69 Furthermore , they function as mechanotransduction units by sensing the extracellular milieu and 70 facilitating signaling via clustering plasma membrane receptors , therefore regulating distinct 71 tissue specific cellular processes ( 45 , 50 – 52 ) . Given their adhesive and mechanosensitive 72 properties , we will refer to these structures as clathrin - containing adhesion complexes ( CCACs ) 73 throughout the remainder of this article . 74 Although CCACs share many features with FAs as adhesive entities , they lack classical 75 components of adhesion complexes and as well as a link to the actomyosin cytoskeleton ( 53 ) . 76 Thus , CCACs are not directly influenced by actomyosin contractility ; instead , they are affected 77 by the biomechanical properties of the ECM and the local membrane tension . Therefore , 78 impediments of endocytosis due to physical or structural constraints including the size of cargo 79 molecules ( 54 – 56 ) , substrate rigidity ( Baschieri et al . , 2018 ) , strength of cell adhesion sites ( 58 , 59 ) 80 and failure to overcome local forces to generate curvature due to high membrane tension prolong 81 the presence of CCS on the plasma membrane and promote CCAC formation ( 60 – 64 ) . Restoring 82 the plasma membrane tension facilitates formation of clathrin pits and triggers CCAC 83 dissociation ( 60 – 64 ) , indicating membrane tension acts as a potent and reversible regulator of 84 CCAC formation and stability . Taken together , our understanding of cellular adhesion reveals a 85 complex landscape where two distinct mechanical forces—plasma membrane tension and stress 86 fiber - based contractile tension—uniquely regulate the formation and stability of CCACs and 87 FAs , respectively . 88 Despite their distinct composition and dynamics , many adhesion complexes are 89 functionally and spatially linked structures ( 65 – 70 ) . Perturbation in one structure often promotes 90 the formation of the other ( s ) through redistribution of integrin receptors ( 65 , 71 – 74 ) , indicating 91 complementary utilization of various adhesion complexes . In the same way , depleting FAs 92 through changes in actomyosin contractility or reducing the expression of FA components 93 4 increases CCAC formation and colocalization with integrin αVβ5 , while disruption of CCACs 94 promotes an increase in size and number of FAs and their integrin αVβ5 content . This 95 competitive conditional existence is most evident during mitosis , where CCACs predominate in 96 the absence of FAs ( 75 , 76 ) . The absence of FAs during the M phase can be attributed to loss of 97 stress fiber - based contractility due to the reorganization of actins into a cortical arrangement ( 77 – 98 79 ) . This cortical actin , tethered to the plasma membrane by membrane - to - cortex adhesion 99 complexes , underlies the heightened membrane tension , which in turn , triggers the formation of 100 CCACs ( 80 – 86 ) . 101 This suggests that crosstalk between actin network organization and plasma membrane 102 tension dictates the context - specific and complementary employment of CCACs and FAs . For 103 comprehensive understanding of reciprocal regulation between cell adhesion and cell cycle 104 progression , it is crucial to establish whether the regulatory mechanisms observed during mitosis 105 persist throughout the cell cycle , potentially influencing phase specific utilization of adhesion 106 complexes . Moreover , while the relationship between membrane tension and actomyosin 107 contractility is well - documented in the context of cell spreading and migration ( 87 – 90 ) , the 108 precise coordination of adhesion complexes by different mechanical forces during these 109 processes require further investigation . 110 In this study , we explain the spatiotemporal regulation of adhesion complexes by 112 fluctuations in mechanical forces during the cell cycle and their impact on proliferation , 113 spreading and migration . Our findings reveal that FAs and CCACs are mutually exclusive , their 114 expression being intricately regulated by cell cycle dependent modulation of membrane tension 115 and transitions of actomyosin contractility modes . Significantly , our data emphasize the 116 competitive dynamics between CCACs and FAs for integrin αVβ5 adhesion sites : elevated 117 membrane tension and cortical actin arrangement predisposes CCACs towards αVβ5 , while 118 reduced tension and stress fiber formation facilitates αVβ5 association with FAs . This 119 competitive binding to αVβ5 adhesion sites critically governs oncogenic cellular behaviors , 120 including cancer cell proliferation , spreading , and migration . Overall , our study provides novel 121 insights into the biomechanical regulation of CCACs and FAs , elucidating their respective roles 122 as suppressors and promoters of cancer progression . 123 124 5 RESULTS 125 1 . CCAC and FA are inversely regulated throughout the cell cycle . 126 To observe the regulation of CCAC and FA structures during cell cycle , we transfected 127 genome - edited eGFP tagged AP - 2 expressing SUM159 triple - negative breast cancer cells with 128 mCardinal tagged paxillin . Cells were synchronized to M phase , harvested with the mitotic 129 shake - off method and imaged with spinning disc confocal microscopy during cell cycle 130 progression . Our results supported the notion that these structures were interchangeably 131 employed ; the expression of AP - 2 marked CCACs and paxillin marked FAs swung inversely 132 during the entire cell cycle ( Figure 1a ) . AP - 2 GFP labels all CCS including CCACs , therefore it 133 is critical to establish a reliable method for distinguishing CCACs . Given their longevity and 134 larger size , CCACs were quantified using specific thresholds applied to both the intensity ( > 150 135 a . u . ) and lifetime ( > 120 seconds ) of the tracked CCS particles ( Figure S1a ) . We validated the 136 reliability of our discrimination method by comparing the Z positions of CCS structures and 137 found that the particles above the thresholds are indeed located closer to the substrate ( Figure 138 S1b ) , which is the prominent feature of CCACs ( 91 ) . 139 Once we optimized the quantification approaches , we compared the abundance of FAs 140 and CCACs during cell cycle stages . We found out that CCAC expression was not limited to the 141 M phase ; instead , it slowly decreased towards the S phase and increased back before the G2 / M 142 phase ( Figure 1b ) . Conversely , FAs displayed a gradual increase starting from the G1 phase , 143 reaching a peak during the S phase , followed by a significant reduction at the G2 / M phase , and 144 ultimately becoming undetectable during the M phase ( Figure 1 b ) . 145 Interestingly , the level of clathrin pits demonstrated a similar profile to FAs throughout 146 the cell cycle ( Figure 1c ) . These findings were consistent with the observed changes in CME 147 dynamics quantified by the standard deviation of growth rate , and initiation and conclusion rates 148 of CCS formation ( Figure S1c , d ) . The initiation and conclusion rates were low during early and 149 late interphase but significantly higher during mid - interphase , indicating heightened CME 150 dynamics at this stage . 151 Furthermore , we found that although the CCAC density in individually monitored cells 152 exhibit a comparable trend throughout the cell cycle , the timing of decline and increase in CCAC 153 6 density was not perfectly synchronized ( Figure s1e ) , likely due to slight variations in the 154 progression rate of the cell cycle . Interestingly , we also noticed that the inverse regulation of 155 CCAC and FA expression was evident in the asynchronized cell population ( Figure s1f ) , where 156 transient overexpression of FAs coincided with lower expression of CCACs , and vice versa . 157 These results further confirm that that CCAC and FAs are mutually exclusive structures , 158 mutually inhibiting each other ' s presence . 159 FAs significantly vary in size and dynamics ( 92 ) . In addition to FA density , we found out 160 that the morphometry ( mean particle intensity and area coverage ( Figure S1g ) of FAs oscillates 161 during interphase , indicating both nascent and mature focal complexes were cell cycle regulated . 162 In contrast to previous reports ( 75 ) , we did not observe any significant changes in cellular 163 localizations of both CCACs and FAs during interphase . To track the CCAC subcellular 164 localization , we generated a temporal color map of CCS particles ( Figure S1j ) . Further 165 application of the intensity threshold and imaging the lowest possible z - position , left us with 166 CCACs alone , by excluding smaller and dynamic pits . Although FAs were located at the cellular 167 edges in some cells , the subcellular localizations of both CCACs and FAs during interphase were 168 different for each cell , lacking any remarkable cell cycle - specific spatial imprint . Population of 169 cells at particular cell cycle stages was verified by quantifying PI - stained nuclei with Flow 170 Cytometry ( Figure S1k ) . 171 Furthermore , to validate the functional role of CCACs as adhesion units and investigate 172 their localization with integrins , we conducted immunostaining experiments . Previous research 173 identified that integrins αVβ5 , β3 and β1 reside in both FAs and CCACs ( 30 , 53 , 71 , 93 – 98 ) . Our 174 findings confirm that αVβ5 integrin exhibited colocalization with bright and large CCS located 175 in proximity to surface , the features associated with CCACs , as well as with the FAs . However , 176 no significant colocalizations of CCS and β3 and β1 integrins were observed ( Figure S2a , b ) . 177 Lastly , it has been reported that CCAC colocalizes with αVβ5 exclusively during 178 mitosis ( 76 ) . However , we observed that αVβ5 to CCAC colocalization persists throughout the 179 interphase in synchronized cells ( Figure S2c ) . The degree of colocalization corresponded with 180 the cell cycle - regulated oscillation of FA and CCAC densities ( Figure S2d ) . 181 182 7 183 184 185 2 . Cyclin D1 - Cdk4 / 6 inhibition prevents CCAC to FA switch . 186 The decrease in CCAC abundance and the onset of FA expression during the G1 phase 187 ( Figure 1b ) temporally associated with the peak expression of Cyclin D1 , which marks the 188 Cyclin D1 - Cdk4 / 6 activity ( Figure S3a ) . Cdk4 / 6 has been identified as an upstream kinase in 189 integrin signaling and is suggested to regulate integrin - based adhesion complexes ( 99 ) . Moreover , 190 cytoplasmic Cyclin D1 - Cdk4 phosphorylates membrane - associated paxillin , promoting Rac1 191 activation and triggering cell spreading and migration ( 100 ) . This evidence prompted us to 192 hypothesize a potential role for Cyclin D1 - Cdk4 / 6 in the adhesion mode switch from CCACs to 193 FAs . 194 To investigate this hypothesis , we treated cells with PD332991 , a selective Cyclin D - 195 Cdk4 / 6 inhibitor ( 101 ) . Our findings revealed a significant increase in CCAC density upon 196 functional depletion of Cdk4 / 6 , while concurrently reducing the morphometric parameters of 197 FAs including density ( Figure 2a , b ) , intensity , and area coverage ( Figure S3b ) . Additionally , 198 there was a notable shift in the proportion of CCACs and clathrin pits in Cdk4 / 6 - inhibited cells 199 ( Figure 2c ) . Furthermore , the colocalization patterns of FA and CCAC with integrin αVβ5 also 200 demonstrated alterations in response to functional depletion of Cdk4 / 6 ( Figure S3c ) . 201 Interestingly , in Cdk4 / 6 inhibitor treated cells , in addition to individually organized 202 CCAC and FA structures , we identified aligned arrays of CCAC and FA presumably sharing the 203 same adhesion sites ( Figure 2a , marked by arrows in the middle panel ) . These adhesion sites , 204 whether exclusively occupied by individual complexes or jointly by both CCACs and FAs , 205 exhibited linear and radially asymmetric configurations . Their sizes varied from 0 . 25µm ^ 2 to 206 0 . 85µm ^ 2 , falling within typical range of integrin - based adhesion sites . Remarkably , not only 207 did these adhesion sites maintain a consistent orientation , but the internal arrangement of FA and 208 CCACs within them also showed a consistent pattern , pointing existence of polarized mechanical 209 and molecular cues ( Figure 2a , middle panel ) . 210 Through immunostaining experiments , we discerned that certain integrin αVβ5 adhesion 211 sites were distinctly occupied by either FAs or CCACs , while some sites indeed occupied by 212 8 both complexes ( Figure 2d ) . This underscores that these adjacently suited entities inhabit the 213 same adhesion sites . Intriguingly , while the majority of these adjacent CCACs and FAs remained 214 stable over time without evident spatial overlap or interchange ( Figure S3d ) , we observed a 215 marked shift at specific adhesion sites ( Figure 2a , zoomed in subset in the middle panel ) . Here , 216 CCACs appeared to exert force to gradually push against and eventually supplanting the FAs . 217 This forceful dynamic suggests a competitive antagonism between CCACs and FAs . Our 218 observations lead us to theorize that , upon extended exposure to Cdk4 / 6 inhibitors , CCACs 219 might dominate and eventually replace FAs in a manner reminiscent of a relentless tug - of - war . 220 Building on this , with longer treatment ( 48 hours ) , we indeed observed occupation of 221 most adhesion sites by CCACs , and FA expression was almost eliminated ( Figure 2a , right 222 panel ) . The CCACs appeared in extended linear arrays and oriented similarly to FA stripes in 223 polarized cells , indicating CCACs might have replaced FAs on integrin αVβ5 adhesion sites over 224 time . However , this duration of treatment caused significant cell death ( Figure S3e ) , possibly 225 indicating the intricate balance between adhesion complexes is essential for cell survival . 226 To further validate the impact of Cdk4 / 6 activity on adhesion mode switch and rule out 227 potential side effects of the Cdk4 / 6 inhibitor , we knocked down Cyclin D1 , which is required for 228 Cdk4 / 6 activation ( Figure S3i ) . Consistent with previous findings , shRNA - mediated 229 downregulation of Cyclin D1 expression also promoted CCAC formation and FA dissociation 230 ( Figure S3f , g ) . 231 Both chemical and genetic perturbation of Cyclin D1 - Cdk4 / 6 activation resulted in cell 232 cycle arrest at the G1 phase ( Figure S3h ) , raising the question of whether Cyclin D1 - Cdk4 / 6 233 might be regulating the switch between adhesion modes through impeding the cell cycle 234 progression . The absence of active Cyclin D1 - Cdk4 / 6 results in cell cycle arrest at the G1 / S 235 checkpoint , ultimately triggering an exit from the cell cycle into a quiescent state ( G0 ) ( 102 , 103 ) . 236 To investigate this , we examined the regulation of adhesion complexes during G0 state by 237 serum - starving cells for 72 hours . Similar to depletion of Cyclin D1 - Cdk4 / 6 activity , we 238 observed a significant increase in CCAC density as cells exited the cell cycle , whereas FAs 239 almost completely dissociated . Reintroducing serum stimulated cell cycle reentry and partially 240 restored the adhesion complex ratio , promoting FA formation and dissociating CCACs cells 241 ( Figure S3j ) . However , this restoration was not to the extent in asynchronized cells . This 242 indicates that , although cell cycle progression was reestablished with introduction of serum 243 9 ( Figure S3h ) , active Cdk4 is required for complete recovery of adhesion mode . These 244 observations suggest that Cyclin D1 - Cdk4 / 6 may regulate adhesion mode switching not only 245 directly through its kinase effect but also indirectly by influencing the cell cycle progression . 246 247 3 . Membrane tension is the major regulator of adhesion mode switch . 248 Membrane tension has been identified as a key regulator of CCAC formation . Therefore , 249 we hypothesized that alterations in CCACs during the cell cycle may be governed by changes in 250 plasma membrane tension . In support of this hypothesis , our optical tweezer - based 251 measurements of tether force revealed cell cycle - dependent fluctuations in membrane tension 252 force ( Figure 3a ) . The tether force correlates with the energy necessary for the invagination of a 253 clathrin - coated vesicle , elucidating the oscillation we observed in the CCAC to clathrin pit ratio 254 across the cell cycle ( Figure 1c ) . In addition , the inhibition of Cyclin D1 - Cdk4 / 6 activity also 255 resulted in a significant increase in membrane tension ( Figure 3b ) . 256 Mirroring the mechanoregulatory influence of membrane tension on CCACs , FAs are 257 similarly governed by fluctuations of actomyosin contractility throughout the cell cycle . Similar 258 to many morphogenic events , the cell cycle is punctuated by a periodic transition between the 259 contractility modes , driven by the intracellular reorganization of actin network between cortical 260 and stress fibers in N2A and CHO cells ( 104 ) . We showed that during G1 to S phase transition , 261 actins reorganize from mostly cortical arrangement into stress fibers and subsequently returns to 262 cortical structure towards the end of G2 phase in SUM159 breast cancer cells ( Figure 3d ) . This 263 observation accounts for the elevated membrane tension observed during early G1 and late G2 264 phases , as the cortical actin network is known to contribute to membrane tension ( 105 , 106 ) . 265 However , during late G1 and S phase , low membrane tension is associated with appearance and 266 consolidation of stress fibers , thereby promoting FA formation . In addition to this , the 267 disassembly of the cortical actin arrangement during G1 renders actins readily accessible , 268 presumably facilitating their role in CCS invagination ( Figure 1c , ( 107 ) , therefore promoting 269 CCAC dissociation . 270 To further corroborate our hypothesis and establish a link between membrane tension and 271 adhesion mode switch , we utilized both chemical and mechanical approaches to ectopically 272 modulate membrane tension . We recently reported that , fasudil , a Rho kinase inhibitor , increases 273 10 membrane tension and cortical actins . Conversely , leptin , which increases stress fibers - based 274 actomyosin contractility , reduces membrane tension ( Figure 3c ) ( 108 ) . We further verified these 275 results by comparing the phosphorylated ERM ( Ezrin , radixin , moesin ) proteins in these cells . 276 pERM mediates membrane - to - cortex attachment , therefore , are associated with increased 277 membrane tension ( 109 – 112 ) . Consistent with our prior findings , fasudil treatment resulted in a 278 marked increase in pERM localization on the plasma membrane . In contrast , leptin treated cells 279 exhibited primarily cytoplasmic pERM , with no detectable pERM accumulation on the 280 membrane ( Figure S4a ) . 281 As anticipated , we observed a remarkable switch in densities of the adhesion complexes 282 in response to changes in these forces . Specifically , a fasudil induced elevation in membrane 283 tension promoted CCAC formation , whereas a leptin induced reduction in membrane tension 284 promoted FA formation ( Figure 3g ) . In addition to this , with the elevated membrane tension 285 induced by fasudil , we saw a predominant localization of CCAC to integrin αVβ5 . On the other 286 hand , leptin treatment facilitated occupation of αVβ5 sites primarily with FA complexes ( Figure 287 3j , k ) . 288 We next assessed the effect of changes in membrane tension on cell cycle regulation of 289 adhesion complexes . We treated cells synchronized to S phase with fasudil and found out that 290 fasudil treatment reversed the adhesion complex ratio and stimulated actin reorganization from 291 stress fibers into cortical actin network ( Figure 3e , h ) . Similarly , in cells arrested at G1 phase due 292 to Cdk4 / 6 inhibition , leptin treatment was sufficient to reverse the adhesion complex density and 293 stimulated transition from cortical arrangement into stress fibers ( Figure 3f , i ) . We also observed 294 that although fasudil and leptin induced minor shifts in the cell cycle profile , these changes were 295 not significant , indicating that their effects are predominantly exerted through direct modulation 296 of cell membrane mechanics ( Figure S4h ) . 297 Although leptin stimulates actin stress fiber formation , it doesn ' t directly govern actin 298 rearrangement ( 113 ) . To rule out any indirect effects influencing adhesion complex dynamics 299 during leptin treatment , we exposed cells to Rho A activator I , a recognized promoter of stress 300 fiber formation and its corresponding actomyosin contractility . Similar to leptin treatment , Rho 301 activator I treatment had a counteractive impact on the adhesion complexes : CCACs were 302 reduced by ~ 30 % , while FAs rose significantly ( Figure S4b , e ) . However , unlike fasudil and 303 11 leptin , we found that Rho A activator I had significant cytotoxic effects ( Figure S4g ) . Moreover , 304 changes in ratios of the cortical actin to the stress fibers and the subcellular distribution of pERM 305 in Rho activator I treated cells was not as profound as in leptin treatment . This suggests that 306 leptin is a more effective and safer agent for inducing actin rearrangement and consequently , 307 mediating the switch in adhesion mode . 308 Although we have explored the roles of both actomyosin contractility and membrane 309 tension , it remains unclear which of these mechanical forces is the upstream regulator of the 310 interchangeable deployment of adhesion complexes . To demystify this , our subsequent approach 311 was to directly modulate membrane tension . First , we mechanically induced changes in 312 membrane tension by subjecting cells to a hypoosmotic solution , which increases in - plane 313 tension on the membrane . This intervention led to an increase in CCAC density , a decline in FA 314 density and interestingly reorganization of actin into cortical actin arrangement ( Figure S4c , e ) . 315 Concurrently , we observed a pronounced localization of pERM to the membrane during 316 hypoosmotic shock ( Figure S4 f ) . Our observations resonate with prior studies highlighting the 317 reciprocal regulation between cortical contractility and membrane tension ( 87 , 105 , 114 – 116 ) . In 318 conjunction with these studies , our data indicate that while cortical tension contributes to 319 increased membrane tension , a rise in in - plane membrane tension also actively promotes cortical 320 actin organization . 321 As an alternative approach to modulate membrane tension directly , we treated cells with 322 methyl - beta - cyclodextrin ( MBCD ) , a compound known for depleting cholesterol and increasing 323 cell membrane tension . This treatment mirrored our earlier findings , revealing a surge in CCAC 324 density and a drop in FAs ( Figure S4 d , e ) . Further , MBCD also induced cortical actin formation 325 and pERM clustering on the membrane ( Figure S4 f ) . Interestingly , upon removal of MBCD and 326 its replacement with normal media , as well as post - restoration of tension following hypoosmotic 327 shock , we detected reformation of FAs accompanied by rearrangement of stress fibers ( Figure 328 S4c ) . These data collectively indicate that change in membrane tension serves as the primary 329 driving force behind the adhesion mode transition , with the actin arrangement either synergizing 330 with or counteracting this mechanism . 331 332 12 4 . Membrane tension regulates cell spreading and migration via coordinating adhesion 333 complexes . 334 Coordination of membrane tension and actomyosin contractility is essential for several 335 processes including cell spreading and migration ( 18 , 88 , 117 – 119 ) . Notably , cancer cells , 336 characterized by enhanced proliferation , spreading , and migration , tend to have softer 337 membranes compared to non - cancerous cells ( Ref ) . Based on this observation , we hypothesized 338 that the mechanical state of a cancer cell , particularly its adhesive behaviors , plays a central role 339 in its increased capacity for spreading and migration . 340 To test this , we first compared the spread area and migration speed of SUM159 cells 341 during the cell cycle . We found that cell cycle stages associated with increased membrane 342 tension —and consequently , a predominance of CCACs at adhesion sites—correlated with 343 reduced spreading and migration abilities ( Figure 4a - c ) . In contrast , during the late G1 and S 344 phases where membrane tension is low , stress fibers - based contractility is high and therefore 345 adhesion sites are dominated by FAs , we observed significant increase in cell spreading and 346 migration . Interestingly during the early G1 and G2 phases - the cell cycle stages which 347 corresponds to switch in adhesion modes - we noted a discernible inflection point in the trajectory 348 of cell migration speed , further indicating the counteractive roles of CCACs and FAs in cell 349 migration ( Figure 4a , S5a , pointed by arrows ) . Reinforcing these findings , pharmacological 350 inhibition of Cdk4 / 6 activity and cell cycle exit to quiescent ( G0 ) state , which increase 351 membrane tension , substantially reduced the migration abilities of a cell ( Figure S5 b ) . 352 We observed similar results when membrane tension and actomyosin contractility were 353 modulated externally . Fasudil treatment reduced spreading and migratory capabilities , whereas 354 leptin expanded the cell spread area and enhanced motility ( Figure 4d - g ) . Furthermore , we 355 observed significantly more blebbing and protrusions in leptin treated cells ( Figure 4g , right 356 bottom panel ) . Collectively , these observations emphasize the role of the intricate interplay 357 between membrane tension and actomyosin contractility in determining a cell ' s adhesive 358 modalities , which subsequently influence its spreading and migration dynamics . 359 In addition to the mode of adhesion , the strength of adhesion plays critical role in cell 360 spreading and migration ( 120 ) . It is known that strong and stable adhesion prevents the cell from 361 releasing its cytoskeleton - ECM linkages , whereas weak and transient adhesion does not generate 362 the contractile force necessary for cell movement ( 121 – 125 ) , indicating that an intermediate state 363 13 of adhesion is most favorable for efficient migration and spreading . To delve deeper into 364 understanding adhesion complexes’ dynamics , we treated cells with cilengitide . This compound 365 acts as competitive ligand mimetic inhibitor to integrins ( 126 ) and does not disrupt existing 366 integrin binding sites . Instead , it selectively impedes the formation of new integrin interactions , 367 thereby can be used to assess the stability of adhesion complexes . Live imaging of cilengitide 368 treated cells showed that FAs persisted longer than CCACs ( Figure S5 c ) , indicating FAs are 369 more stable structures . The transient or weak interaction of CCACs with the ECM is presumably 370 insufficient for establishing robust anchoring points necessary for effective membrane 371 protrusions , which explains reduced cell spreading and migration . On the contrary , cells treated 372 with a high concentration of leptin ( 100nM ) and Rho activator I ( 10µl / ml ) , also resulted in 373 stalled migration ( Figure S5d ) , presumably due to highly stabilized FAs and stress fibers . This 374 indicates that cells require a fine - tuned balance between CCACs and FAs to efficiently spread 375 and migrate . 376 In addition to their role in cell spreading and migration , regulation of cell adhesion is 377 imperative for proper cell cycle progression and proliferation ( 13 , 127 – 134 ) . While short term 378 treatment of cells with fasudil ( 20µM , 2 hours ) and leptin ( 30nM , 24 hours ) did not markedly 379 alter cell cycle profile ( Figure S4h ) , interestingly , extended exposure elicited substantial changes 380 in cell proliferation rate . Time - lapse imaging of cells for 36 hours showed that , Fasudil ( 1µm ) 381 treatment notable decreased proliferation , whereas leptin ( 30nM ) enhanced it ( Figure 4g , S5e ) . 382 Based on these observations , we speculate that when membrane tension is high , CCACs 383 act as an antagonist of FAs at integrin αVβ5 based adhesion sites . Through their weak and 384 transient interaction with ECM , CCACs act as restrains on cell proliferation , spreading and 385 migration . However , when membrane tension is low , CCACs dissociate from these adhesion 386 sites , allowing the formation of FAs and generation of forces necessary for these cellular 387 behaviors ( Figure 5 ) . 388 389 Discussion : 390 Membrane tension is increasingly appreciated to be a key regulator of many cellular 391 functions ( 90 , 112 , 118 , 119 , 135 – 139 ) . Here , we found that change in membrane tension exerts an 392 14 upstream control in adhesion modes of cells eventually affecting multiple cellular process which 393 demand extensive membrane remodeling . Our findings indicate that two distinct adhesion 394 complexes - CCACs and FAs - are not only utilized interchangeably but also compete in their 395 deployment . This competitive and interchangeable utilization of the adhesion complexes is 396 coordinated by the intricate interplay of membrane tension and actomyosin contractility , 397 ultimately influencing the extent of cell proliferation , spreading and migration in cancer cells . 398 Cancer cells exhibit enhanced proliferation and migration ( 140 ) , This is partly due to 399 their softer plasma membrane and disrupted actin dynamics that allow rapid and extensive 400 morphological changes ( 141 – 152 ) . In a multicellular setting , higher cortical contractility in 401 epithelial cells reinforces cell - cell adhesions and contribute to preservation of tissue integrity . 402 Whereas enhanced stress - fiber - based contractility and reduced cortical stiffness in mesenchymal 403 cells , enable them to detach and migrate from the primary tumor into ECM during 404 metastasis ( 143 , 153 – 155 ) . Our data corroborates these concepts and reveals that decreased 405 membrane tension along with increased stress fiber formation enhances the aggressive behaviors 406 observed in cancer cells via promoting occupation of integrin αVβ5 based adhesions sites with 407 FA . However , elevated membrane tension and cortical actin organization facilitates occupation 408 of integrin αVβ5 based adhesions sites with CCAC and reduces malignant features of cancer 409 cells . 410 Alterations in membrane tension not only dictate adhesion modes but also lead to 411 dysregulated endocytosis in cancer cells . Our findings indicate that reduced membrane tension is 412 associated with an increase in clathrin pit formation ( Figure 1c ) , influencing CME dynamics . 413 The enhancement in CME dynamics facilitates the uptake of nutrients , signaling receptors , and 414 adhesion complexes , furthering cancer progression ( 156 – 159 ) . Consequently , targeting 415 endocytosis systematically has been recognized as a promising anticancer strategy ( 160 , 161 ) . 416 Beyond molecular interventions in CME , manipulating the mechanical properties of cancer cell 417 membranes has shown potential in reducing malignancy ( 152 , 162 – 164 ) . For instance , it was 418 shown that increasing membrane tension prevented endocytosis of death receptors , thereby 419 enhancing sensitivity of cancer cells to immune cell - mediated destruction ( 108 , 165 ) . Therefore , 420 increasing membrane tension might not only sensitize cancer cells to apoptosis but also inhibit 421 clathrin pit and FA formation , further impeding cancer progression . 422 15 Moreover , consistent with others , we observed an inverse relationship between the 423 strength of membrane - to - cortex attachment and cancer malignancy ( 166 – 169 ) . We found that 424 pERMs are translocated to plasma membrane when cells were treated with fasudil , MBCD or 425 exposed to hypoosmotic shock ( Figures S5 a , f ) , indicating positive feedback loop between 426 membrane tension and localization of pERM to the membrane . High levels of pERM on cell 427 surface are reported to prevent BAR / F - BAR proteins to deform the plasma membrane . 428 Constitutively active ezrin promotes pERM translocation to the plasma membrane , reducing 429 metastasis and proliferation ( 170 , 171 ) , while dephosphorylated ERM detaches from the 430 membrane and facilitates lamellipodia formation and cell migration in breast cancer cells ( 172 ) . 431 Additionally , functional perturbation of ERM proteins impedes CCP maturation and reduces rate 432 of endocytosis ( 173 ) . Hence , these observations , along with our own , imply that the translocation 433 of pERM to the membrane promotes the formation of CCACs rather than clathrin pits by 434 hindering membrane curvature . This could occur either by directly obstructing curvature - 435 generating proteins or by increasing membrane tension through a reinforced connection to the 436 cortical actin . 437 In addition to mechanoregulations of adhesion complexes , we identified CyclinD1 - 438 CDK4 / 6 – an oncogene notably overexpressed in most tumor cells – as an essential upstream 439 regulator influencing adhesion mode of the cell . We found that inhibition of CyclinD1 - CDK4 / 6 440 prevented CCAC to FA switch and induced membrane tension elevation presumably via 441 triggering G1 / S checkpoint ( Figure 2a , b and 3b ) . This observation is consistent with previous 442 studies showing that the failure to degrade adhesion complexes in a timely manner or alterations 443 in membrane tension due to high osmolarity or reorganization of actin network can induce cell 444 cycle arrests ( 13 , 174 , 175 ) . While further investigation is necessary to determine the reciprocal 445 relationship between checkpoint activation and tension induced adhesion mode switch , our data 446 further underscore the rationale of targeting Cdk4 / 6 activity as a therapeutic strategy in oncology 447 ( 176 , 177 ) . 448 The observed inverse crosstalk between CCACs and FAs which is mediated by the 449 competitive redistribution of αVβ5 integrins also exists between other adhesion complexes 450 ( 72 , 74 , 178 – 180 ) . For instance , competitive interactions of hemidesmosomes and FAs with 451 integrin α6β4 determines the invasive phenotype in cancer cells , where presence of integrin α6β4 452 16 in hemidesmosomes is correlated with a diminished invasive capability ( 181 – 184 ) . Moreover , 453 hemidesmosomes contribute to regulate FA and CCAC stability in keratinocytes via controlling 454 their localization to αVβ5 integrin in tension dependent manner ( 72 , 185 ) . Similar inverse 455 dynamics is observed between invadosomes and FAs : invadosome assembly is favored when FA 456 and stress fiber - based actomyosin contractility are low ( 179 , 186 ) ( Kedziora 2016 ) . Conversely , 457 the dissolution of invadosomes correlates with the formation of β3 - integrin - rich FAs , impairing 458 the ECM remodeling during invasion ( 187 ) . These observations underscore that , beyond the mere 459 availability of integrins , the affinity of integrins to adhesion complexes is critical in determining 460 the adhesion mode of a cell . Drawing on these findings , we hypothesize that CCACs exhibit a 461 greater affinity for integrin αVβ5 than FAs ( Figure S5c ) , therefore predominate αVβ5 adhesion 462 sites and prevent FA assembly . This hypothesis is substantiated by studies showing that 463 overexpression of β5 facilitates the formation of CCACs , whereas the depletion of β5 impairs 464 CCACs without similarly affecting FAs ( Baschieri et al . , 2018b ; J . G . Lock et al . , 2018a ) , 465 indicating higher affinity of β5 to CCACs . 466 Adhesion dynamics is also affected by binding strength of adhesion complexes to ECM 467 and cytoskeletal fibers . For efficient spreading and migration , strong yet dynamic anchoring 468 adhesion points are required ( 188 – 190 ) . Our data suggest that CCAC mediated adhesions are 469 weaker and more transient ( Figure S5c ) , insufficient to drive forces for cellular protrusions . This 470 is consistent with observations that adhesion strength is at its minimum during mitosis ( 191 ) , 471 where CCACs are the predominant adhesion complexes , rendering cells immobile ( 192 , 193 ) . 472 Furthermore , not only the overall force exerted by the cells , but the traction force normalized by 473 the area are cell cycle regulated . Traction force tend to increase as cells progress through G1 , 474 before reaching a plateau in S phase , and then decline during G2 ( 194 , 195 ) which mirrors FA 475 expression ( Figure 1a , b ) . This implies that when bound to αVβ5 adhesion sites , FA links the 476 stress fibers to ECM and exert localized and optimal forces conducive to efficient cell spreading 477 and migration . In contrast , αVβ5 integrin sites occupied by CCACs fail to serve as robust 478 anchoring points , as they are not tethered to actomyosin fibers but are influenced solely by the 479 overall mechanical state of the membrane . Although these hypotheses have valid assumptions to 480 build on , further detailed assessments are needed for quantification of CCAC versus FA driven 481 cell to ECM attachment strength . 482 17 Collectively , our research demonstrates that elevated membrane tension imparts a 483 dominant negative effect of CCACs on FAs at integrin αVβ5 adhesion sites . This results in 484 weaker and more transient ECM interactions , thereby inhibiting cell proliferation , spreading , and 485 migration . Conversely , when membrane tension is reduced , CCACs release their hold on these 486 adhesion sites , facilitating the formation of FAs and the exertion of mechanical forces essential 487 for cellular protrusions ( Figure 5 ) . In summary , our findings provide novel insights into the 488 biomechanical regulation of CCACs and FAs , highlighting their respective roles in either 489 suppressing or promoting cancer cell progression . The data we present serve as a benchmark for 490 future research into the coordination of diverse adhesion complexes across various biological 491 contexts . Furthermore , examining the levels of CCACs and FAs in cancer cells of varying 492 degrees of malignancy , as well as their healthy counterparts could be insightful . Such an 493 investigation may contribute to the identification of novel biomarkers for cancer malignancy . 494 Overall , these studies have the potential to significantly advance our understanding of the 495 complex biological mechanisms that contribute to cellular processes demanding extensive 496 membrane remodeling . 497 498 Acknowledgements 499 This work was funded by Pelotonia Fellowship awarded to U .

A ) The schematic summary of the report where high membrane 1197 tension , along with cortically arranged actins and reduced Cyclin D - Cdk4 / 6 activity results in occupation 1198 of integrin αVβ5 adhesion sites with CCACs . This prevents cells migration , spreading and proliferation . 1199 APs : Adaptor proteins 1200 1201 B ) When membrane tension drops , actins organize into stress fibers and in presence of active Cyclin D - 1202 Cdk4 / 6 , CCACs dissociate , allowing formation of FAs on integrin αVβ5 adhesion sites . This facilitates 1203 migration , spreading and proliferation . 1204 1205 1206 1207 1208 1209 1210 1211 1212 1213
