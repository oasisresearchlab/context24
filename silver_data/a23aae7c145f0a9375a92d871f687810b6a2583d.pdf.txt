ON THE STRENGTH OF CONNECTEDNESS OF A RANDOM GRAPH P . ERDbS ( Budapest ) , corresponding member of the Academy , and A . @ NY1 ( Budapest ) , member of the Academy Let G be a non - oriented graph without parallel edges and without slings , with vertices VI , V ? , . . . , Vgl . Let us denote by d ( Vk ) the valency ( or degree ) of a point VP in G , i . e . the number of edges starting from 6 : . Let us put ( 1 ) c ( G ) = , _ “ , ‘i , d ( V ~ ) . . = z < If G is an arbitrary non - complete graph , let cZ1 ( G ) denote the least number k such that by deleting k appropriately chosen vertices from G ( i . e . deleting the k points in question and all edges starting from these points ) the result - ing graph is not connected . If G is a complete graph of order n , we put c , ( G ) = n - l . Let cY ( G ) denote the least number 1 such that by deleting 1 appropriately chosen edges from G the resulting graph is not connected . We may measure the strength of connectedness of G by any of the numbers c ] , ( G ) , c $ , ( G ) and in a certain sense { if G is known to be connected ) also by c ( G ) . Evidently one has ( 2 ) c ( G ) z cc ( G ) s c , ( G ) . It is known further that any two points of G are connected by at least c , ( G ) paths having no point in common , except the two endpoints ( theorem of MENGER - WHITNEY , see [ I ] and [ 2 ] ) and by at least c ( G ) paths having no edge in common ( theorem of FORD and FULKERSON , see [ 3 ] > . We shall denote by T , . ( G ) the number of vertices of G which have the valency r ( r = 0 , 1 , 2 , . . . ) . As in two previous papers ( [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] ) we consider the random graph C7 , s defined as follows : Let there be given n labelled points VI , V . . , . . . , V , , . Let us choose at random N edges among the possible edges connecting these n points , so that each of the possible choices of these edges should be equiprobable . We denote by r , i . s the random graph thus obtained . We shall denote by P ( s ) the probability of the event in the brackets . 262 P . ERDdS AND A . RtiNYI The aim of this note is to investigate the strength of connettedness of the random graph f ; , , N when n and N both tend to + 60 , N = N ( n ) being a function of n . As it has been shown in [ 4 ] , the following theorem holds : THEOREM 1 . If we have N ( n ) = Gn log n + cm + o ( n ) where cc is ~ 1 real constant , then the probability of r , , , - \ ( , * ) being connected tends to exp ( - e - 3M ) for n - + $ - m . In this paper we shall prove the following theorem : THEOREM 2 . If we have N ( n ) = $ n logn + $ nloglogn + crn + o ( n ) where u is a real constant and r a non - negative integer , then ( 3 ) further lim P ( c , ( r ! , > - Y ( ~ ) ) = r ) = I - exp 91 + + DZ and ( 5 ) 11 e - “a lim P ( c ( r , , , xiFLj ) = r ) = l - exp - yl . - + + a , ( I REMARK . Clearly Theorem 2 can be considered as a generalization of Theorem 1 . As a matter of fact , any of the statements c , ( G ) = 0 or c , ( G ) = 0 is equivalent to G not being connected and thus for r = 0 ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) reduce to the statement of Theorem 1 . It has been shown further in [ 4 ] that if N ( n ) = $ - log n + cm + o ( n ) and r , l . s ( , , ) is not connected , then it con - sists almost surely of a connected component and of a few isolated points . Therefore ( 5 ) is for r = 0 also equivalent to the statement of Theorem 1 . Thus in proving Theorem 2 we may restrict ourselves to the case r 2 1 . The statement ( 5 ) of Theorem 2 gives information about the minimal valency of points of r , X , s . In a forthcoming note we shall deal with the same question for larger ranges of N ( when c ( ~ + ~ , A - ) tends to infinity with n ) , further with the related question about the maximal valency of points of r , , , s . We shall prove further the following THEOREM 3 . If we have N ( n ) = - $ n log n + $ - n log log n + rcn + o ( n ) where u is a real constant and r a non - negafive integer , then we have ( 6 ) lim P ( Yf . ( r’ , , NcnJ = k ) = y for k = O , 1 , . ‘ . IL - - f + CD ON THE STRENGTH OF CONNECTEDNESS OF A RANDOM GRAPH 263 where i = G ; in oiher words , the distribution of v , v ( l ; , , Ncn , ) tends to a Poisson distribution . PROOF OF THEOREMS 2 AND 3 . Let r 2 1 be an integer and - 00 < a ! < + 00 . Let us suppose that ( 7 ) N ( n ) = ~ nlogn + + nloglogn + cfn + o ( n ) . Let ra , N be a random graph with the n vertices VI , VZ , . . . , V , and having N edges . Let Pk ( n , N , r ) denote the probability that by removing r suitably chosen points from r , , , there remain two disjoint of k and n - k - r points , respectively . We may suppose k we have clearly It follows by some obvious estimations that ( 8 ) 2 ( r + 3j $ p @ < k & q P , ( n , N ( n ) , r ) = 0 [ i ) . Now we consider the case k s ( rf 3 ) logn log log n ’ Let Pt ( n , N , r ) denote the probability that by removing r suitably chosen points ( the set of which will be denoted by A ) r jJ , N can be split into two disjoint subgraphs r’ and r” consisting of k and n - k - r points , respectively , but that r , , N can not be made disconnected by removing only r - l points . If r , , , N has these pro - perties and if s denotes the number of edges of r , , x connecting a point of d with a point of P , then we have clearly s 2 r . Otherwise , by definition , s s rk . Thus we have ( 9 ) . 264 P . ERDi ) S AND A . R ~ NYI It follows that 00 ) [ - - I @ + 3 ~ ~ v1 Ph” ( n , N ( n ) , r ) = * ( g - - j . From ( 8 ) and ( 10 ) it follows that for n + + CL ( 11 ) P ( cp ( CT , X ( n ) ) = r ) - P ( c ( rn , , ( 71 , ) = r ) . As a matter of fact , ( 8 ) and ( 10 ) imply that if by removing f suitably chosen points ( but not by removing less than r points ) T + N ( ~ , , can be split into two disjoint subgraphs I“ and r” consisting of k and n - k - r points , respec - then only the case k = l has to be considered , the probability of k > 1 being negligibly small . It remains to prove ( 5 ) . This can be done as follows . First we prove that ( 12 ) lim P { c ( r , : , , 370LJ z r - l ) = 0 . n - t + o , For r = 1 this follows already from Theorem I . Thus we may suppose here r 2 2 . We have and thus ( 13 ) P ( c ( F , , xc3Lj ) s r - l ) = 0 - - A - ( 1 log n which proves ( 12 ) . Now let v , , ( m , h ) denote the number of vertices of r , ! , , ~ - which have the valency r . Then we have clearly by ( 12 ) ( 14 ) P ( c ( T , , A ~ ( , ~ ) ) = r ) - P ( y , ( G , X @ ? , ) # 0 ) . Now evidently ( 15 ) where ( 16 ) Jj + . & y ~ f . . 2 P ( d ( Vi , ) = r , d ( V , , ) I - r , . . . , d ( Kj ) = r ) . l ~ k , < 1 , < . . ~ ih , ~ + a Evidently , if we stop after taking an even or odd number of terms of the ON THE STRENGTH OF CONNECTEDNESS OF A RANDOM GRAPH 265 sum on the right - hand side of ( 15 ) , we obtain a quantity which is greater or smaller , respectively , than the left - hand side of ( 15 ) . Now clearly and thus ( 17 ) lim S 1 - e - “” iL + + m r ! * Now let us consider P ( d ( Vk , ) = I - , d ( VkJ = r ) where k , # kg . If both V , , and V , , have valency r , three cases have to be considered : a ) either V , , and Vh3 are not connected , and there is no point which is connected with both M , and V , , ; b ) or Vkt and L ; , , are not connected , but there is a point connected with both ; c ) VTC , and VP2 are connected . We denote the probabilities of the corresponding subcases by P , ( d ( Vk , ) = r , d ( Kc , ) = r ) , P & ‘ ( I / h - , ) = r , d ( V , ; J = r ) and P , ( d ( Vk , ) = r , d ( VI ; J = r ) , respectively . We evidently have ( ( ; I - - ( Zn - 3lj P , ( d ( K ; , ) = r , d ( Vk , ) = r ) - r , ‘ ( n ( + ; 2 ) L2 ) , N ( n ) n ? * i i il 2 and thus . . A & ) : On the other hand ( denoting by 1 the number of points which are connected with both VT , , and ViJ . , > , we have P & y VA , ) = Y , d ( VLJ = r ) = ( 19 ) 266 P . ERDdS AND A . R6NYl Similarly one has P , ( d ( Vlk , ) = = r , d ( V , , ) = 1 . ) = Thus we obtain The cases j > 2 can be dealt with similarly . Thus we obtain ( 21 ) ( j = 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , . . . ) . > t + + CC It follows from ( 16 ) and ( 21 ) that ( 22 ) lim P ( vg . ( T , , , rr7 , j ) # 0 ) = I - exp Il + + o ) In view of ( 2 ) , ( 11 ) and ( 14 ) Theorem 2 follows . To prove Theorem 3 it is sufficient to remark that by the well - known formula of CH . JORDAN and thus by ( 21 ) , putting i , = yl , we obtain for k = 0 , 1 , . . . ( 24 ) Thus Theorem 3 is proved . Our thanks are due to T . GALLAI for his valuable remarks .
