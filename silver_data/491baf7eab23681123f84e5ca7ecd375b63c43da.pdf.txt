Speci ﬁ cally , photopatterning is emerging to introduce heterogeneity in hydrogel properties ; however , currently employed systems are limited in the range of properties that can be obtained , as well as in decoupling mechanical properties from changes in chemical signals . Here , we present an orthogonal photopatterning system that utilizes thiol - norbornene chemistry and permits extensive hydrogel modi ﬁ cation , including with multiple sig - nals , due to the number of reactive handles accessible for secondary reaction . Hyaluronic acid was functionalized with norbornene groups ( NorHA ) and reacted with di - thiols to create non - toxic hydrogels with a wide range of mechanical properties . For example , for 4 wt % NorHA at 20 % modi ﬁ cation , hydrogel mechanics from w 1 kPa up to w 70 kPa could be obtained by simply changing the amount of crosslinker . By limiting the initial extent of crosslinking , NorHA gels were synthesized with remaining pendent norbornene groups that could be reacted with thiol containing molecules in the presence of light and an initiator , including with spatial control . Secondary reactions with a di - thiol crosslinker changed me - chanical properties , whereas reaction with mono - thiol peptides had no in ﬂ uence on the gel elastic modulus . This orthogonal chemistry was used sequentially to pattern multiple peptides into a single hydrogel , demonstrating the robustness of this system for the formation of complex hydrogels .

Introduction Hydrogels have become a ubiquitous tool for bioengineers since their properties mimic features of the extracellular environment and can provide structure and molecule delivery to control cell behavior [ 1 , 2 ] . Hydrogels have evolved into complex materials where they present temporally and spatially controlled mechanical properties , ligands , degradation , drug elution , and topography to cells [ 3 e 6 ] . This enhanced complexity better mimics the natural behavior of the extracellular matrix and can be used to investigate heterogeneous environments , such as during development and in disease states . To address questions related to cells and their microenvironment , it is important to independently alter only one property , so that the impact of that feature on cells can be decou - pled from other signals . Creating a hydrogel with the ﬂ exibility to spatiotemporally alter multiple properties independently is not trivial and requires the careful selection of chemistry that permits both gel formation and subsequent modi ﬁ cation . Photopatterning is one method to alter the properties of a hydrogel monolith as it provides both spatial and temporal control since the desired reaction only occurs when and where light is applied [ 3 ] . Furthermore , light based multi - photon reactions pro - vide a means to pattern features within a hydrogel without altering its surface properties , unlike 2D patterning techniques such as wrinkling and soft lithography [ 7 , 8 ] . In the simplest form , such systems use the same chemistry ( e . g . , light induced radical poly - merization of ( meth ) acrylate functionalized macromers ) to form the initial gel , as well as to photopattern peptides , proteins , or small molecules containing reactive groups [ 9 ] . These traditional radical - ( meth ) acrylate systems are straightforward , but the concentration of crosslinks and peptides are coupled within the photopatterned regions . Thus , systems to photopattern hydrogels such that cross - link density and peptide / molecule modi ﬁ cations can be altered independently are needed . Orthogonal systems are useful for the formation and subsequent modi ﬁ cation of hydrogels , where the reactions used have high speci ﬁ city and reactivity toward a particular functional group . These systems typically employ a spontaneous gelation reaction ( i . e . , the * Corresponding author .

After gelation , the above systems can be designed to permit photopatterning . For example , light sensitive nitrobenzyl ether moieties allow for cleavage of chemicalgroupsingels to reduce gel modulus , introduce topography , or release molecules [ 6 , 13 , 26 ] . Radical generation with light sensitive initiators has also been used to pattern additional crosslinks in gels , temporally increasing me - chanical properties and controlling proteolytic degradation , but these systems are limited only to changing the mechanics of gels [ 17 e 20 , 22 ] . To pattern proteins and peptides , coumarin - protected thiols can be exposed with light and then further reacted for patterning [ 15 , 24 ] . Finally , the radically initiated thiol - ene reaction between thiols and ( meth ) acrylates has been used to pattern ligands , but due to the high reactivity of the ( meth ) acrylates to radical polymerization they polymerize as well , changing mechanical properties while patterning ligands [ 10 e 13 , 27 , 28 ] . In contrast , the radically induced thiol - norbornene click reac - tion alleviates the concerns of non - speci ﬁ c reactions due to the high reactivity of thio - radicals to norbornene and the low reactivity of norbornene - radicals to norbornenes [ 27 , 28 ] . This light induced thiol e norbornene reaction has been used extensively to form hydrogels [ 29 e 37 ] , but few approaches have utilized this chemistry to photopattern hydrogels [ 16 ] . These thiol - norbornene hydrogels have been made exclusively from multi - arm ( 4 e 8 ) PEG macromers that are end functionalized with norbornene groups . In a typical system , three of the norbornene functional groups are required to form a network , leaving only one norbornene per macromer on average for further functionalization of peptides , proteins , and small molecules . As a result , these systems are limited in the range of functionalization possible during patterning of mechanics or chemical ligands . Here , we addressed the limitations of previous orthogonal photopatterning approaches by developing a simple but robust system using the thiol - norbornene chemistry to form and photo - pattern hydrogels . To facilitate this goal , hyaluronic acid ( HA ) was used as the macromolecular backbone as it is not only part of the native extracellular matrix , but it has numerous groups along its backbone that are accessible for functionalizationwith norbornene . 2 .

Proton nuclear magnetic resonance ( 1 H NMR ) spectroscopy was performed on a 360 MHz Bruker DMX 360 . Statistical signi ﬁ cance was found using single - factor ANOVA with a ¼ 0 . 5 . 2 . 2 . Synthesis of norbornene modi ﬁ ed hyaluronic acid ( NorHA ) Prior to NorHA synthesis , HA was converted to its tetrabutylammonium salt ( HA - TBA ) so that it would be soluble in dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) . To make HA - TBA , NaHA was dissolved in deionized water ( DI H 2 O ) at 2 wt % and the Dowex 50W proton exchange resin was added to the solution ( 3 g resin per 1 g NaHA ) and allowed to exchange for 5 h . The resinwas ﬁ ltered off and the ﬁ ltrate was titrated to a pH of 7 . 03 with TBA - OH ( w 1 . 4 TBA per HA repeat unit ) . The resulting solutionwas frozen at (cid:2) 80 (cid:3) C , lyophilized , and stored at (cid:2) 20 (cid:3) C until used . See Figure S1 for the 1 H NMR spectrum of HA - TBA . To synthesize NorHA , HA - TBAwas dissolved in anhydrous DMSO ( 2 wt % ) with a 3 : 1 M ratio of 5 - norbornene - 2 - carboxylic acid ( mixture of endo and exo isomers ) to HA - TBA repeat units and 4 - ( dimethylamino ) pyridine ( 1 . 5 M ratio to HA - TBA repeat units ) was added under a N 2 atmosphere . The solution was heated to 45 (cid:3) C and di - tert - butyldicarbonate ( Boc 2 O ) was added bysyringe intothe ﬂ ask at a 0 . 4 M ratioto HA - TBA repeat units . After 20 h , cold water was added to quench the reaction and thesolutionwaspuri ﬁ edbydialysisfor3dtoremoveDMSO .

Synthesis of ﬂ uorescent and thiol containing peptides Using standard solid supported ( glycinol 2 - chlorotrityl resin ) Fmoc protected peptide synthesis , peptides with the sequence GCDDD - Fluor were synthesized , where Fluor denotes one of three ﬂ uorescent molecules : 5 ( 6 ) - carboxy ﬂ uorescein ( FSH ) , rhodamine b ( RSH ) , or 7 - methoxycoumarin - 2 - acetic acid ( McSH ) . The pep - tidewascleavedfromtheresinwithtri ﬂ uoroaceticacid , precipitatedtwiceintocold diethyl ether , dissolved in PBS , frozen at (cid:2) 80 (cid:3) C , and lyophilized .

See Figure S2 for 1 H NMR spectra and Figures S3 e S5 for MALDI spectra of the various peptides . 2 . 4 . Fabrication of NorHA gels and mechanical testing NorHAwas dissolved in PBS to a desired concentrationwith varying amounts of dithiothreitol ( DTT ) and 0 . 05 wt % 2 - hydroxy - 4 0 - ( 2 - hydroxyethoxy ) - 2 - methylpropiophenone ( I2959 ) . The weight percent of NorHA ( W NorHA ) , ratio of DTTthiolstonorbornenes ( X DTT ) , andirradiationtime ( t I ) werevariedsystematically for the gels . The prepolymer solution ( 50 m L ) was transferred to syringes with their tips removed , covered with a No . 1 cover slip , and irradiated for the desired time with UVlight at 10 mW / cm 2 power . Individual gelswereremovedfromthe syringes andplacedin1mLofPBStoswellovernight beforemechanicaltesting . Compressive moduli were found using a TA Instruments DMA Q800 ﬁ tted with a compression clamp , running at a constant strain rate of 10 % / min in air at room temperature . The modulus was calculated from the slope of the stress e strain curve between 10 and 20 % strain ( n (cid:4) 3 ) . 2 . 5 . Cell toxicity and encapsulation studies Forassessmentof thetoxicityof solubleNorHA , humanmesenchymalstemcells ( hMSCs ) wereplatedatadensityof2500cells / cm 2 onTCPSandincubatedingrowth media overnight . Subsequently , the media was supplemented with NorHA at vary - ing concentrations ( 0 , 1 . 25 , 2 . 5 , and 5 mg / mL ) and changed every 3 days . On days 4 and 7 , metabolic activity was assessed with Alamar Blue ( Invitrogen ) as speci ﬁ ed in manufacturer ’ s instructions . Brie ﬂ y , cells were incubated with 10 % Alamar Blue in serum - free media for 3 h and the ﬂ uorescence was read with 570 / 610 nm as the excitation / emission wavelengths . The % relative viability for NorHA containing media was calculated as the ratio of each solution ’ s ﬂ uorescence to the average ﬂ uorescence of the Alamar Blue solution for cells cultured without NorHA . For encapsulation studies , hMSCs were suspended in macromer precursor ( W NorHA ¼ 4 wt % , X DTT ¼ 0 . 3 , 0 . 05 wt % I2959 ) solution in PBS at 10 7 cells per mL under sterile conditions . The solution ( 40 m l ) was transferred to sterile syringe tips , covered with a cover slip , and irradiated for 30 s with UV light ( 10 mW / cm 2 ) . The gels were transferred to 24 - well plates with 2 mL of hMSC growth media and incubatedat37 (cid:3) C . At1and3dofincubation , gels ( n ¼ 3 ) wereremovedfrommedia and stained with a LIVE / DEAD cell viability assay ( Invitrogen ) following the man - ufacturer ’ s instructions and imaged with confocal microscopy . 2 . 6 . Secondary modi ﬁ cation of NorHA gels NorHA gels were made as described above ( W NorHA ¼ 4 % , X DTT ¼ 0 . 3 or 0 . 5 , t I ¼ 30s ) andtheresultinggelswereswollenovernightinPBSat4 (cid:3) C . Afterthiswash step , the desired secondary reactionsolutionwas introduced intothe gels overnight at 4 (cid:3) C and the gels were irradiated with UV light ( 10 mW / cm 2 ) for 120 s . To achieve additional crosslinking , solutions of DTT at various concentrations ( C DTT ) with 0 . 05 wt % I2959 in PBS were introduced into each gel . To demonstrate that modi ﬁ - cation with a mono - thiol molecule does not alter the mechanical properties , a so - lutionoftheFSH ( 0 . 04m M ) and0 . 05wt % I2959inPBSwasintroducedintoaseriesof gels . To demonstrate that functionalizing the gels with RGD does not alter the me - chanical properties , RGD ( 2 m M ) and 0 . 05 wt % I2959 were introduced into the gels . All gels were compression tested as described above . W . M . Gramlich et al . / Biomaterials 34 ( 2013 ) 9803 e 9811 9804 2 . 7 . Photopatterning NorHA gels To provide a stable surface to attach thin gels , cover slips ( No . 2 glass , 22 (cid:5) 22 mm ) were plasma etched for 2 min , coated with ( 3 - mercaptopropyl ) tri - methyl siloxane , and baked for 1 h at 100 (cid:3) C and then 10 min at 110 (cid:3) C . The residue was washed from these thiolated cover slips ( with dichloromethane , acetone , and methanol ) , dried , and stored under N 2 ( no more than 24 h ) prior to use . To fabricate the gels , 100 m L of prepolymer solution ( W NorHA ¼ 4 wt % , 0 . 05 wt % I2959 , various X DTT ) was placed on a large cover slip ( No . 1 glass , 45 by 50 mm dimensions ) . The thiolated cover slips were placed thiol - side down on the solution while supported by No . 2 glass cover slips at its edges and the solution was irradiated through the thiolatedcoverslipwithUVlight ( 10mW / cm 2 ) for30s , yieldingagelwith w 200 m m thickness that could be removed from the bottom cover slip while remaining attached to the thiolated cover slip . Gels prepared as described above were incubated overnight at 4 (cid:3) C in the desired peptide or DTT solutions . Typical patterning solutions for ﬂ uorescent pep - tides were 60 , 4 , and 5 m M of McSH , RSH , and FSH , respectively , with 0 . 05 wt % I2959 and 1 wt % bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) in PBS . Solutions to pattern RGD and DTT consistedof 2 m M thiols ( 1 m M DTT , 2 m M RGD ) , 0 . 05 wt % I2959 , and5 m M FSH inPBS ( as an indicator of pattern location ) . Gels containing the desired solution were covered with a CAD drawn photomask transparency ( CAD / Art Services , Inc ) and irradiatedfor 60 s ( 10 mW / cm 2 ) . Patternedgels were placed in PBS and incubated at 4 (cid:3) C for at least 48 h with PBS changes twice a day to remove unreacted peptide or DTT . For sequentially patterned gels , after the previously mentioned incubation period the next dye solution was introduced , photopatterned , and washed out as describedabove .

Atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) characterization Thin 3D NorHA gels were synthesized as described above ( X DTT ¼ 0 . 3 , t I ¼ 30 s , W NorHA ¼ 4 % ) . Gels were photopatterned ( 120 s irradiation , 10 mW / cm 2 ) with so - lutions of either DTT ( 1 m M ) or RGD ( 2 m M ) using a 100 m m parallel line photomask . FSH was patterned simultaneously with DTT or RGD for visualization of the patterned regions . AFM was performed on an Asylum Research MFP - 3D AFM equipped with an inverted optical microscope . The tips used were 1 m m diameter SiO 2 beads with a 0 . 06 N / m cantilever spring constant ( Novascan ) . Contact force maps were obtained such that they had patterned and unpatterned regions with two force maps obtained per gel . A Hertzian model of contact behavior was used to Fig . 1 .

Modulus values from patterned regions were normalized to the unpatterned regions of the gel to give a normalized modulus ( n (cid:4) 15 ) . 3 . Results and discussion 3 . 1 . Synthesis of NorHA and gelation scheme NorHA was synthesized from HA - TBA ( Fig . 1a ) using Boc 2 O coupling chemistry to couple norbornene acid to the HA backbone . The NorHA was collected in high yield after dialysis ( 90 % ) and had w 20 % of its repeat units functionalized with pendent norbornenes . With this degree of functionalization , the NorHA had nearly ﬁ fty norbornenes per 90 kg / mol chain , presenting numerous reaction points . These pendent norbornenes can undergo a thiol - ene reac - tion with a di - thiol crosslinker to form a gel ( Fig . 1b ) . Ideally , only three norbornenes per polymer chain are required to form a network , leaving numerous other unreacted norbornenes in the network that can undergo secondary reactions to increase the crosslink density or couple chemical ligands ( Fig . 1b ) . 3 . 2 . Tunability in NorHA gel properties Due to the robustness of the thiol - norbornene chemistry , nearly any water soluble di - thiol molecule ( e . g . , peptide containing two cysteine residues ) can crosslink NorHA to form a gel . In our study , DTT was used as the di - thiol linker to produce hydrolytically stable gels ( Figure S6 ) . All gels were formed with UV light ( 320 e 390 nm ) irradiated ( 10 mW / cm 2 ) radical generation by the I2959 initiator at 0 . 05 wt % concentration for all experiments . The three parameters that were varied to control the compressive moduli ( E c ) of the gels were the UV light irradiation time ( t I ) , ratio of DTT thiols to nor - bornene ( X DTT ) , and weight percent NorHA in the solution ( W NorHA ) . At a X DTT of 0 . 5 and W NorHA of 4 % , precursor solutions were irradiated with UV light for various t I to observe the kinetics of gelation ( Fig . 2a ) . Upon irradiation , within seconds the solution gelled and the E c quickly plateaued such that after 5 min the E c was w 90 % of its plateau value ( 20 min ) . Rheology ( Figure S7 ) con ﬁ rmed this fast gelation as the storage modulus ( G 0 ) increased orders of magnitude in less than 10 s and it also con ﬁ rmed that once irra - diation ceased gelation stopped as evidenced by the unchanging modulus . Unlike other orthogonal gelation / patterning systems , the E c of NorHA gels can be controlled simply by t I as the reaction ceases once light is removed , whereas spontaneous reactions go to completion . The X DTT was also varied at W NorHA equal to 4 % and a t I of 45 min , well past the 20 min to reach plateau E c ( Fig . 2b ) . For X DTT values of 0 . 1 e 0 . 6 , the plateau E c increased nearly linearly with increasing X DTT due to increased crosslink density from the DTT reacting with the excess norbornenes off NorHA . At X DTT equal to 1 , an equal Fig . 2 .

At X DTT values around 1 ( 0 . 6 e 1 ) , this maximum was observed ( Fig . 2b ) . The maximum E c begins at a lower X DTT than expected likely due to the non - ideal nature of the systemwhere some of the DTT - norbornene reactions occurred with norbornenes on the same NorHA chain and as a result did not form an effective crosslink . With a X DTT greater than one , the E c drops from the maximum value due to excess thiols in the system Fig . 3 . ( a ) E c of NorHA gels ( X DTT ¼ 0 . 3 , t I ¼ 30 s , W NorHA ¼ 4 % ) after secondary reactions with different concentrations of DTT introduced into gel ( C DTT ) and UV light irradiation ( 0 . 05 wt % I2959 , 2 min irradiation , 10 mW / cm 2 ) .

Thus , the resulting gels likely have free thiols pendent off the NorHA chains in the network . Further demonstration of the ﬂ exibility of the E c obtained from the NorHA systemwas observed by varying the W NorHA at t I and X DTT equal to 30 s and 0 . 5 , respectively ( Fig . 2c ) . By changing the W NorHA an order of magnitude , the observed E c changed two orders of magnitude . These results along with the t I and X DTT data demon - strate the tunability of this system without the need to synthesize a new macromer . Additionally , the control afforded to the system due to its initiation with light allows for speci ﬁ c moduli to be targeted and the possibility for further reactions after gelation . 3 . 3 . NorHA cytocompatibility To demonstrate NorHA ’ s utility as a biomaterial , the cyto - compatibility of the macromer with human mesenchymal stem cells ( hMSCs ) was studied . hMSCs were cultured with NorHA at various concentrations ingrowth media ( 0 e 5 mg / mL ) for 7 days . After 4 days of incubation , there was no statistically signi ﬁ cant difference in metabolic activity of the hMSCs ( Alamar Blue ) cultured in NorHA containing media as compared those cultured in media without NorHA ( Figure S8 ) . After 7 days , there was a reduction in the meta - bolic activity for cells cultured at the highest NorHA concentration ( 5 mg / mL ) . Additionally , hMSCs were encapsulated in 3D NorHA gels ( W NorHA ¼ 4 % , X DTT ¼ 0 . 3 , t I ¼ 30 s ) and incubated for one and three days . The fast gelation of this system allowed for cells to be quickly encapsulated ( 30 s ) with low toxicity ( 96 and 88 % viability for one and three days after encapsulation , respectively , Figure S9 ) , con - ﬁ rming the low toxicity of NorHA and suggesting its possible use for cell studies . 3 . 4 . NorHA gel secondary modi ﬁ cation After gelation , we targeted secondary reactions between thiol - containing molecules and unreacted norbornenes in the gel . To ensure that norbornenes did remain after gelation , all gels to be patterned had X DTT values below 1 ( 0 . 3 e 0 . 5 ) and a t I equal to 30 s . During rheological studies , sequential irradiation ( t I ¼ 30 s ) pro - duced step changes in G 0 , indicating that norbornenes remained after the initial gelation ( Figure S7 ) . 1 H NMR spectroscopy of gels degraded by hyaluronidase ( Figure S10 ) con ﬁ rmed the presence of norbornenes after the initial 30 s exposure . Fora t I of 30 s , the E c as a function of X DTT still behaved as it did at t I equal to 45 min ( Fig . 2d ) and a maximum E c was observed around X DTT equal to 1 and gels with a range of E c were produced . NorHA gels irradiated for 30 s ( X DTT ¼ 0 . 3 , W NorHA ¼ 4 % ) were used as starting materials to alter the mechanical properties after initial gelation . The initial gels were washed with PBS and a reaction solution consisting of 0 . 05 wt % I2959 and various concentrations Fig . 5 . Patterned ﬂ uorescein dye ( FSH ) ﬂ uorescence intensity as a function of irradiation time and position on the gel with confocal images of selected regions of the patterned gel . The spatial and temporal gradient of ﬂ uorescence was generated by passing an opaque mask over a 100 m m line patterned photomask irradiated with UV light ( 10 mW / cm 2 ) . Each second of irradiation corresponds to 147 m m of linear travel . Images above the plot correspond to the red outlined areas on the plot .

Gramlich et al . / Biomaterials 34 ( 2013 ) 9803 e 9811 9808 of DTT ( C DTT ) was incubated with the gel overnight . The gels were subsequently irradiated with UV light ( 10 mW / cm 2 ) for 2 min and their E c was measured ( Fig . 3a ) . When a solution of only I2959 ( C DTT ¼ 0 ) was reacted with the gel , no change in E c from the original gel was observed . This result suggests that there are few free thiols remaining inthe gel that can form additional crosslinks . Additionally , this result con ﬁ rms that the norbornenes will not signi ﬁ cantly react with each other through a radical mechanism .

This secondary crosslinking gives an over 2 - fold increase in E c over the initial value . The maximum E c value obtained through a secondary reaction is less than the maximum E c through initial gelation ( 46 versus 70 kPa ) , which could be a result of unreacted NorHA being removed during the initial swelling with PBS e nearly 15 % as indicated by the aforementioned stability study ( Figure S6 ) e before the secondary reaction . To further demonstrate the orthogonal nature of this system , mono - thiols were reacted with NorHA gels ( X DTT ¼ 0 . 5 , t I ¼ 30 s , W NorHA ¼ 4 % ) in a similar fashion to the DTT secondary reaction . The mono - thiols should not increase the E c of the NorHA gel since they lack the di - thiol structure to make effective crosslinks . Adding a cysteine functionalized ﬂ uorescein dye ( FSH ) or RGD cell adhe - sion peptide containing a cysteine group with I2959 did not signi ﬁ cantly ( p ¼ 0 . 9 and 0 . 2 for FSH and RGD , respectively ) in - crease the E c after irradiation for 2 min ( Fig . 3b ) . As expected , when DTT and initiator were reacted with the original gel , a signi ﬁ cant increase in E c occurred ( p ¼ 6 (cid:5) 10 (cid:2) 5 ) . These results demonstrate that due to the low reactivity of norbornene to itself during light induced radical reactions , mono - thiol molecules can react with the gel and not change E c , while di - thiols can change E c . This ability to decouple mechanical and chemical modi ﬁ cations permits appli - cation of this gel to a range of biological studies . 3 . 5 . Photopatterning NorHA gels with ﬂ uorescent dyes With the success of the secondary reactions to alter NorHA gels , we investigated the ability to photopattern various dyes within a NorHA gel . The process to photopattern involved introducing the dye molecule that contained a thiol , exposing to light in the pres - ence of an initiator through a mask , and washing out the unreacted dye ( Fig . 4a ) . Speci ﬁ cally , a NorHA gel ( X DTT ¼ 0 . 3 , t I ¼ 30 s , W NorHA ¼ 4 % ) was placed in a reaction solution containing the desired thiol containing molecule and 0 . 05 wt % I2959 and incu - bated overnight . The gel now containing the thiol solution was covered with a transparency photomask and irradiated with UV light . Regions exposed to light underwent the thiol - norbornene reaction , while unexposed regions did not . The gel was then placed in PBS ( washed for several days ) for the unreacted molecules to diffuse out of the gel , leaving behind a photopatterned gel . For easy visualization of photopatterned regions of gels , several thiol contain ﬂ uorescent dyes were developed ( Fig . 4b ) using solid state peptide synthesis . The peptide sequence contained a single cysteine residue that undergoes a thiol - norbornene reaction with NorHA and three aspartic acid residues to give a negatively charge peptide to decrease non - speci ﬁ c binding of the peptide to the gel , facilitating removal of unreacted dye . Due to the ﬂ exibility of solid state peptide synthesis , nearly any molecule containing a free car - boxylic acid can be added to the N - terminus of the peptide . The dyes 7 - methoxycoumarin - 2 - acetic acid , 5 ( 6 ) - carboxy ﬂ uorescein , and rhodamine b were chosen to give reactive peptides that ﬂ uo - resce blue , green , and red , respectively ( McSH , FSH , and RSH ) . These dyes were individually introduced into NorHA gels with 1 wt % BSA and 0 . 05 wt % I2959 , masked with a 100 m m stripe pattern , irradi - ated ( 10 mW / cm 2 ) for 60 s , and washed out with PBS over several days . Confocal microscopy images of the patterned gels ( Fig . 4b ) illustrate the ability of this process to photopattern gels . All three gels have stripes ( 100 (cid:6) 1 m m , n ¼ 7 ) of their respective dye separated by dark unpatterned regions . 3 . 6 . Temporal and spatial control of gel patterns To demonstrate thatthe NorHA system can bemodi ﬁ edwith dyes with precise spatial and temporal control , a w 200 m m thick NorHA gel was synthesized attached to a cover slip ( X DTT ¼ 0 . 3 , t I ¼ 30 s , W NorHA ¼ 4 % ) to provide easy handling and imaging of the gel . A solution of FSH , I2959 ( 0 . 05 wt % ) , and BSA ( 1 wt % ) was introduced into the gel and a gradient photopatterning process was developed where a mask of 100 m m stripes was placed on the gel . The gel was initially irradiated for 30 s before an opaque slide was moved across the gel at a constant rate ( 147 m m / s ) , blocking the UV light . The resulting photopatterned gel had regions irradiated over the range of 30 s e 110 s with UV light . The intensity of the dye ﬂ uorescence increased with longer irradiation time and consequently with posi - tion along the gel ( Fig . 5 ) . Each peak in Fig . 5 corresponds to a region exposedto light where the valleys correspondto regionsnot exposed ( see image insets ) . The intensity increased as more dye reacted with the gel and eventually plateaued as the rate of photobleaching of the dye caught upto the rate of addition . Longer irradiation times led to a decrease in intensity due to this photobleaching ( 100 e 110 s ) . The temporal control of the dye coupling further con ﬁ rms that the sec - ondary thiol - norbornene reaction can be used to control the dosage of molecules throughout the gel . 3 . 7 . Mechanical properties of photopatterned gels Secondary reactions to the bulk gels altered mechanics and ligand introduction ( Fig . 2 ) , so we investigated whether such behavior translates to photopatterned gels . NorHA gels ( 200 m m thickness , X DTT ¼ 0 . 3 , t I ¼ 30 s , W NorHA ¼ 4 % ) were photopatterned Fig . 6 . Normalized modulus for photopattened and non - photopatterned regions of NorHA gels , patterned with either RGD or DTT . Modulus values ( Hertzian ) were calculated from AFM and normalized to the unpatterned regions of each gel . Gels were patterned by irradiationwith UV light ( 10 mW / cm 2 ) through a 100 m m line photomask for 120 s . FSH was included in the patterned regions for visual con ﬁ rmation of pat - terns . Average values were calculated from force mapping over two areas for each gel that were unpatterned and patterned . Error bars are of one standard deviation . * de - notes statistical signi ﬁ cance . W . M . Gramlich et al . / Biomaterials 34 ( 2013 ) 9803 e 9811 9809 with 100 m m stripes of either DTT ( 1 m M DTT , 2 m M thiols ) or RGD ( 2 m M ) . FSH was included to visually identify regions photo - patterned from those not patterned . The normalized modulus ( normalized to the unpatterned region of the gel ) of patterned and unpatterned regions was found by AFM assuming Hertzian me - chanics ( Fig . 6 ) . The RGD patterned gel had a uniform normalized modulus throughout with no signi ﬁ cant difference observed be - tween the patterned and unpatterned regions . As expected , patterning DTT gave a signi ﬁ cant 2 - fold increase in the normalized modulus . Interestingly , a similar 2 - fold increase in E c was observed in the bulk gels with 2 m M DTT ( Fig . 3a ) , suggesting that the reac - tion is consistent for both patterned and bulk reactions . These re - sults con ﬁ rm that patterning modulus and the introduction of mono - functionalized molecules can be achieved independently . 3 . 8 . Sequential photopatterning NorHA gels ( X DTT ¼ 0 . 3 , t I ¼ 30 s , W NorHA ¼ 4 % ) were sequentially patterned with each ﬂ uorescent dye to demonstrate the ﬂ exibility of the system to independently pattern several molecules into one gel . The above patterning procedure for one dye was used to pattern McSH with 100 m m diameter circles , then FSH with 100 m m per side triangles , and then RSH with 100 m m wide stripes . Imaging of the stained gel revealed that all dyes and their respective pat - terns were incorporated into the gel ( Fig . 7 ) . Additionally , several dyes and their patterns overlapped ( McSH and RSH , McSH and FSH ) , indicating that under the conditions investigated norbor - nenes remained after the ﬁ rst dye was patterned so that the second dye could be patterned over it . Such results suggest that several molecules can be sequentially patterned in a single region , effec - tively creating complex shapes of molecules . The FSH triangle mask did have some loss of pattern size when transferred to the gel as indicated by the triangles having edges of w 50 m m and not 100 m m ( Fig . 7a ) . The loss of dimensions could be due to the fact the FSH triangles were patterned on top of the McSH circles . McSH has a non - zero absorbance over the range of the UV light source ( 320 e 390 nm ) and it may have absorbed the UV light that would have been used to couple FSH to gel . The reduction in UV light may have reduced the FSH concentration reacting with the gel and therefore its overall intensity , reducing pattern size . Further evidence of such absorption by McSH can be seen in the vertical slice through the gel ( Fig . 7e ) . The FSH intensity reduces more quickly through the depth of the gel when compared to the other two dyes . Both McSH and RSH pattern through the depth of the gel ( w 200 m m , w 325 m m in thicker gels in Figure S11 ) demonstrating that this system could be used to pattern in 3D a projection of the Fig . 7 . Fluorescent confocal images of sequentially patterned NorHA gel ( X DTT ¼ 0 . 3 , t I ¼ 30 s , W NorHA ¼ 4 % ) . Images for the split channels are presented for ( a ) FSH triangles , ( b ) RSH lines and ( c ) McSH circles , as well as the ( d ) combined ﬂ uorescent channels .

Also , multi - photon approaches could be used to increase the depth and complexity of the patterns . 4 . Conclusions NorHA is an easily synthesized and versatile macromer that can be crosslinked with UV light and di - thiol molecules to create gels with a wide range of mechanical properties from a single macro - mer . By selecting conditions where pendent norbornenes remain in the gel , orthogonal secondary reactions can be performed . The high speci ﬁ city of the norbornenes to react only with thiols allowed for the photopatterning of mono - thiol molecules without changing the gel compressive modulus , as well as patterning of mechanical properties with di - thiol molecules . The robust photopatterning reaction created gels that were spatially and temporally patterned , as well as sequential patterned materials with several different molecules and patterns . The straightforward synthesis , orthogonal patterning , and tunability of this system makes it ideal to system - atically and independently study the effects of mechanical prop - erties and molecules in biological systems .
