VCH SCHOOL STAFF AND STUDENT CASES AND CLUSTERS MeSH : SARS - CoV - 2 , Communicable Disease Control , Schools , Epidemiology 2 Abstract Background : There is an urgent need to assess the role of schools in the spread of SARS - CoV - 2 in Canada to inform public health measures . We describe the epidemiology of SARS - CoV - 2 infection in students and staff in the Vancouver Coastal Health ( VCH ) region in the first three months of the 2020 / 2021 academic year , and examine the extent of transmission in schools . Methods : This descriptive epidemiologic study using contact tracing data included all SARS - CoV - 2 cases reported to VCH between September 10 and December 18 , 2020 who worked in or attended K - 12 schools in - person . Case and cluster characteristics were described . Results : There were 699 school staff and student cases during the study period , for an incidence of 55 cases per 10 , 000 population , compared to 73 per 10 , 000 population in all VCH residents . Among VCH resident staff and student cases , 53 % were linked to a household case / cluster , < 1 . 5 % were hospitalized and there were no deaths . Out of 699 cases present at school , 26 clusters with school - based transmission resulted in 55 secondary cases . Staff members accounted for 54 % of index cases ( 14 / 26 ) while comprising 14 % of the school population . Among clusters , 88 % had fewer than 4 secondary cases . Interpretation : COVID - 19 incidence in the school population was lower than that of the general population . There were no deaths and severe disease was rare . School - based transmissions of SARS - CoV - 2 were uncommon and clusters were small . Our results support the growing body of evidence that schools do not play a major role in the spread of SARS - CoV - 2 . Introduction Early in the pandemic , schools closed across Canada to help reduce the circulation of SARS - CoV - 2 and decrease risks associated with infection among staff and students ( 1 ) . Evidence has since suggested that school closures and decreased in - person learning have had negative impacts on the mental health , wellbeing , educational attainment , social connection , healthcare access , and health behaviors of students , families , and staff ( 1 - 12 ) . Combined with high socioeconomic tolls ( 13 - 15 ) , these unintended All rights reserved . No reuse allowed without permission .

Evidence now indicates that age is a risk factor for severe disease and children typically experience a mild course of illness ( 16 - 22 ) . There is also a growing body of literature suggesting children’s in - person school attendance may not be a significant driver of transmission ; contact - tracing and test - based studies from other jurisdictions have identified little or no transmission in the school setting ( 23 - 34 ) . Internationally , studies illustrate that school re - opening has not impacted numbers of paediatric cases ( 23 , 35 , 36 ) and that the risk of SARS - CoV - 2 infection has not increased for educational staff working with children ( 30 , 36 , 37 ) . There is limited peer - reviewed data in Canada regarding risk of SARS - COV - 2 transmission in schools , although Ottawa Public Health has reported low rates of school - based transmission ( 38 ) . Given that transmission risk is influenced by community - level epidemiology , public health measures , health system infrastructure , and other jurisdictional factors , this study contributes needed evidence within the Canadian context . We aimed to describe cases who attended kindergarten to grade 12 ( K - 12 ) schools in - person , assess the extent of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in schools , and characterize clusters where school - based transmission was observed . Methods Setting During the study period , while mass gatherings remained prohibited , schools and businesses were open with safety plans in place , and masks were encouraged but not required . Travel and gatherings in private residences were restricted gradually starting in November 2020 . There were no stay - at - home requirements ( 39 ) . Symptomatic testing was widely available and contact tracing was conducted for all positive cases ( 40 ) . All rights reserved . No reuse allowed without permission .

During the study period , 17 , 742 staff and 105 , 905 students worked in or attended school in - person at a total of 358 schools ( 104 independent and 254 public ) in the VCH region . Schools in BC reopened following summer holidays on September 10 , 2020 and closed for winter break after December 18 , 2020 . Prior to reopening , schools implemented COVID - 19 safety plans developed with support from Public Health , which included public health measures ( e . g . testing and contact tracing protocols ) , environmental measures ( e . g . enhanced cleaning and disinfection ) , administrative measures ( e . g . scheduling and work practices , health and wellness policies , and cohorting ) , personal measures ( e . g . staying home when sick , physical distancing , hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette ) , and personal protective equipment . Non - medical mask use was supported , but not required ( 42 ) . Public Health Investigation and Response SARS - CoV - 2 Nucleic Acid Amplification testing ( NAAT ) was available for anyone with symptoms , and advised for students or staff with fever or new symptoms persisting > 24 hours . Tests were generally processed within 24 hours . Positive tests were automatically reported to VCH’s Office of the Chief Medical Health Officer , which investigated cases within 24 hours and identified contacts ( 43 ) . Individual risk assessments were performed for all contacts , integrating cases’ symptoms , ages of cases and contacts , nature and duration of contact , setting ( e . g . indoor / outdoor ) , and presence / absence of known SARS - CoV - 2 transmission . Factors constituting high - risk exposures included direct contact with infectious body fluids ( e . g . , via sharing vapes , being coughed or sneezed upon ) and prolonged ( > 15 minutes ) contact with a symptomatic case face to face or at close range ; thus , close contacts were identified among classmates . Factors constituting low - risk exposures included the absence of interactions or interactions outdoors of limited duration and at a distance ( > 2m ) . Individuals with high - risk exposures were advised to self - isolate for 14 days and were monitored by Public Health for emergence of symptoms during their incubation period . Symptomatic individuals were directed to seek testing and few declined . Those with lower risk exposures were advised to self - monitor for symptoms and present for testing accordingly .

Mass asymptomatic testing was undertaken in outbreak settings where uncontrolled spread was observed ; this did not occur in any schools during the study period , and there were no school closures due to SARS - CoV - 2 transmission . Data sources We obtained data from VCH’s electronic COVID - 19 case and contact management platform , capturing contact tracing interview data including demographics , school name , grade , role ( staff / student ) , attendance dates , comorbidities , symptoms , and epidemiologic linkage to other cases within and outside of school . Hospitalizations and ICU admissions to VCH hospitals were determined using individual data linkages to acute care data . Provincial Health Services Authority provided hospitalization data for BC Children’s Hospital . Districts confirmed denominators of staff and students attending in - person during the study period . Duplicate case entries were discarded based on unique identifiers . Cases with missing or incorrect locations were reclassified based on city of residence or postal code . Study design We extracted all lab - confirmed and probable cases aged 5 and older at time of case report between September 10 and December 18 , 2020 who reported working in or attending a K - 12 school within VCH during their incubation or infectious periods . We excluded cases who exclusively worked in or attended a daycare or post - secondary institution , attended school online , or were homeschooled . School staff and student cases were categorized as either school aged ( aged 5 - 17 ) or aged 18 + . We described case characteristics including age , sex , location , linkage to known cases / clusters , comorbidities , symptoms at time of initial interview , status ( recovered / removed from isolation or deceased ) , and hospitalization / ICU admission . To identify potential school transmission events , we analyzed all clusters where 2 or more cases were reported within a 14 - day period in a school .

A chart review of the cluster cases and their epidemiologically linked cases was conducted to verify the likely source of SARS - CoV - 2 infection . A case was determined to be a contact’s likely source if they had prolonged contact during the case’s infectious period and the contact’s incubation period . Sources were categorized as household , social , school , or other . Index and secondary cases were determined by symptom onset date . If there was no contact with a positive case , this was recorded . All cases with multiple potential exposures were reviewed by DB and AC . The source of acquisition was attributed to the school if the non - school source had an unclear symptom onset date and no clear source of acquisition themselves . Finally , secondary cases’ close contacts who became lab - confirmed or probable cases were deemed tertiary cases . The primary outcome was the number of school - based transmissions . All analyses were conducted via statistical computing software R Studio ( 44 ) . P - values were based on Pearson’s chi - squared and independent t - tests for categorical and continuous variables respectively . Results Description of cases in schools In the four weeks prior to school reopening , weekly incidence of SARS - CoV - 2 infection ranged 0 . 8 - 3 . 2 per 10 , 000 population in VCH based on 2019 population estimates ( 41 ) , compared to 2 . 4 - 2 . 8 per 10 , 000 population in the four weeks following reopening . Weekly incidence peaked November 15 - 21 among VCH residents at 9 . 4 per 10 , 000 population and among K - 12 staff and students at 6 . 6 per 10 , 000 population . Between September 10 and December 18 , 8 , 755 cases among VCH residents were reported ( 73 per 10 , 000 population ) , of which 674 ( 8 % ) were K - 12 staff or students . With an additional 25 staff and student cases who resided outside the VCH region , there were 699 cases among 123 , 646 staff and students working in or attending school in - person ( 55 per 10 , 000 population ) in 270 unique VCH region K - 12 schools during the same period .

Excludes 25 cases who resided outside of VCH region but worked in / attended school in - person in the VCH region . b Comorbidity types were not mutually exclusive . Clusters of SARS - CoV - 2 infection in schools There were 71 school clusters totaling 251 cases during the study period . No school - based transmission was suspected in 45 clusters ( 63 % ) , with all 142 cases within these clusters likely acquiring SARS - CoV - 2 outside of school . Within the 26 clusters containing at least one school - acquired case , a further 28 cases likely acquired infection outside of school . Of the 170 cases ( 19 staff and 151 students ) temporally clustered but without evidence of school - based transmission , 107 ( 63 % ) were attributable to household contacts , 17 ( 10 % ) to social networks , 4 ( 2 . 4 % ) to sports teams , and 2 ( 1 . 2 % ) to work outside of school . 40 students and staff ( 24 % ) had no known contact with another case inside or outside of school . Cases with evidence of school - based transmission Out of 699 cases present at school , transmission stemming from 26 index cases resulted in 55 secondary cases at school . Two hundred and thirty - seven close contacts were identified from these 55 secondary cases , and 10 became tertiary cases . Staff accounted for 54 % of index cases ( 14 / 26 ) and 25 % of secondary cases ( 14 / 55 ) . Staff cases ( n = 28 ) included 19 teachers , 6 support workers , and 3 principals / office staff members . Of the 81 index and secondary cases , 47 ( 58 % ) worked in or attended a K - 7 school , 25 ( 31 % ) a grade 8 - 12 school , and 9 ( 11 % ) a K - 12 school . The characteristics of clusters with school - based transmission are presented in Table 2 . Among 26 total clusters , 13 ( 50 % ) had only 1 secondary case , 10 ( 38 % ) had 2 - 3 secondary cases , and 3 ( 12 % ) had 4 or more secondary cases . All clusters with 4 or more secondary cases had an index staff case and occurred in grades K - 7 . The median size of clusters was 3 ( range 2 - 8 ) when the index case was a staff member compared to 2 ( range 2 - 3 ) when the index case was a student .

Of the 14 clusters including both staff and students , 9 ( 64 % ) occurred in grades K - 7 and 5 ( 36 % ) in grades 8 - 12 . School - based activities where transmission may have occurred are presented in Table 3 . Evidence of transmission was most commonly found in a shared classroom , but no specific class type was more frequently identified . For some cases , there were multiple exposures settings within the school , notably through socializing with a classmate . Table 2 .

Interpretation During the study period 8 , 755 cases of SARS - CoV - 2 infection were reported among VCH residents ( 73 per 10 , 000 population ) compared to 699 among VCH K - 12 student and staff ( 55 per 10 , 000 population ) . While 251 cases were temporally clustered with another case in the same school within a 14 - day period , 170 ( 68 % ) of these cases had no evidence of school - based transmission . We identified 26 clusters with evidence of school - based transmission resulting in 55 school - acquired cases ( 0 . 04 % of 123 , 646 individuals working in or attending school ) in 25 / 358 ( 7 . 0 % ) K - 12 schools in the VCH region . Cluster sizes were small , with 50 % leading to 1 secondary case and 88 % having fewer than 5 cases total ; largest clusters were observed in elementary schools . The index case was a staff member in over half of the clusters ( 54 % ) , although staff only constituted 35 % ( 28 / 81 ) of all cases linked to school - based All rights reserved .

A shared classroom accounted for most transmissions ; no particular class / activity was noticeably higher risk . Our findings support the growing body of evidence that schools are likely not a significant driver of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission ( 23 , 35 , 36 ) . In concordance with other studies , we found that a household case was the predominant source of infection for school - aged children ( 30 , 32 ) , and that school - based acquisitions were uncommon ( 29 , 30 , 32 , 33 ) . Individuals with COVID - 19 seldom infected others at school ; out of 699 student and staff cases , we identified school - based transmissions stemming from 26 index cases ( 3 . 9 % ) . The ratio of secondary cases to total primary cases was 0 . 09 in the school setting , compared to 0 . 27 observed in Luxembourg ( 30 ) , 0 . 08 in Germany ( 32 ) and 0 . 02 in South Korea ( 23 ) . While we did not systematically track the number of school contacts per index case , the secondary attack rate is likely to be very low given the low number of identified secondary cases , in concordance with prior studies across several countries ( 24 , 25 , 28 , 30 ) . As observed elsewhere , where school - based transmission occurred , the number of secondary cases was limited ( 23 , 31 , 45 ) , although one large high school outbreak was described in Israel ( 46 ) in the context of crowding and a concurrent heat wave . Interestingly , we observed a larger number of secondary cases when the index case was an adult , similar to the experience in England ( 31 ) and Singapore ( 26 ) . Finally , our findings reinforced the observation that numerous cases in a school can reflect multiple introductions from the community rather than school - based transmissions ( 2 ) . Of note , our study was conducted in the context of limited circulation of SARS - CoV - 2 variants of concern , strong collaboration between the public health and education sectors , good school - based infection prevention and control measures , and rapid access to testing and contact tracing . Contact tracing within 24 hours and regular monitoring of cases and contacts may have prevented transmission to tertiary cases . Further studies will be required to evaluate the impact of individual infection prevention and control measures . All rights reserved . No reuse allowed without permission .

However , our analysis was limited by reliance on routinely collected data and by potential recall bias , although case / proxy report was supplemented with information from school administrators as needed . While Medical Health Officers could request asymptomatic testing for the purposes of public health investigation , universal testing was not required . Transmissions to undetected ( e . g . asymptomatic and not tested ) secondary and tertiary cases were therefore not examined , which could disproportionately affect groups more likely to experience asymptomatic infection . However , studies that employed asymptomatic testing of school contacts reported low levels of transmission ( 24 , 25 , 28 ) . Class sizes were not measured ; thus , any association with school - based transmissions was not assessed . The potential for misclassification of the likely source of acquisition for cases with multiple exposures was minimized via independent review of these cases by two members of the research team . This study was limited to descriptive statistics and causal inferences cannot be drawn . Conclusion In conclusion , from September 10 to December 18 , 2020 we detected minimal clusters and low rates of secondary transmission at schools . In - person school attendance may not expose students and staff to higher risks than those experienced in the community when infection prevention and control measures are in place , and adequate case and contact management capacity is available . Caution should be taken in generalizing these findings due to differences in underlying epidemiology , public health measures , health system infrastructure , and culture , among other factors that may differ by jurisdictions . However , our findings suggest that schools may be able to safely remain open in settings with moderate community transmission ( i . e . , weekly incidence of 10 - 100 cases per 100 , 000 as observed in this study ) with infection prevention and control measures in place and sufficient public health capacity for rapid testing and contact tracing .

Table A1 . Data dictionary Term Definition Lab confirmed case A person with laboratory confirmation of infection with the virus that causes COVID - 19 performed at a community , hospital or reference laboratory ( NML or a provincial public health laboratory ) running a validated assay . This consists of detection of at least one specific gene target by a NAAT assay ( e . g . real - time PCR or nucleic acid sequencing ) . ( 47 ) Probable - lab case A person ( who has had a laboratory test ) with fever ( over 38 degrees Celsius ) or new onset of ( or exacerbation of chronic ) cough AND who meets the COVID - 19 exposure criteria and in whom a laboratory diagnosis of COVID - 19 is inconclusive . Inconclusive is defined as an indeterminate test on a single or multiple real - time PCR target ( s ) without sequencing confirmation or a positive test with an assay that has limited performance data available . ( 47 ) Probable epi - linked case A person ( who has not had a laboratory test ) with fever ( over 38 degrees Celsius ) or new onset of ( or exacerbation of chronic ) cough AND either close contact with a confirmed case of COVID - 19 or lived in or worked in a closed facility known to be experiencing an outbreak of COVID - 19 ( e . g . , long - term care facility , prison ) . ( 47 ) COVID - 19 Symptoms Any one of : abdominal pain , arthralgia , chills , coma , confusion , conjunctivitis , cough , diarrhea , discoloration of toes or fingers , dizziness , fatigue , fever , headache , loss of appetite loss of sense of smell / taste , myalgia , nasal congestion , nausea , pharyngitis , rash , rhinorrhea , shortness of breath / breathing difficulty , or vomiting . ( 47 ) Recovered / Removed from isolation Self - isolation for a person diagnosed with COVID - 19 has been discontinued based on criteria outlined by Interim Guidance ( 43 , 47 ) . Deceased Death from any cause occurring in a person diagnosed with COVID - 19 with no period of complete recovery between illness and death . ( 47 ) Ever Hospitalized Any person admitted to a hospital for at least an overnight stay , or with a prolongation of hospitalization , for reasons directly or indirectly related to their COVID - 19 infection , and with no period of complete recovery between illness and admission . ( 47 ) Ever Admitted to ICU Any person admitted to an intensive care unit ( ICU ) for at least an overnight stay , or with a prolongation of ICU stay , for reasons directly or indirectly related to their COVID - 19 infection , and with no period of complete recovery between illness and admission .

Smoking / vaping Client self - report at time of case interview . Linked to confirmed case : Yes , non - household contact Client report close contact with a probable or confirmed case of COVID - 19 in a non - household setting within 14 days prior to illness onset . Linked to confirmed case : Yes , household contact Client reported close contact with a probable or confirmed case of COVID - 19 in a household setting within 14 days prior to illness onset . Linked to confirmed case : No Client did not report close contact with a probable or confirmed case of COVID - 19 within 14 days prior to illness onset . Staff Case reporting working in a K - 12 school within the learning setting in - person , or directly interacting with those within the learning setting , including teachers , support workers , principals / vice principals and office staff members . Student Case ( or proxy ) reporting attending a K - 12 school in - person . Cohort A group of students and staff who remain together throughout a school term , the composition of which is consistent for all activities that occur in schools ( 42 ) . While classes are the primary form of grouping where students spend the majority of their time , classes within a shared cohort may interact with each other for activities like physical education or music .
