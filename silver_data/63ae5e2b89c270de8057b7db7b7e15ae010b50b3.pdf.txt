Such forces are used for cell motility , cytokinesis , and tissue remodeling . Among those actin networks , we focus on the actin cortex , a dense branched network beneath the plasma membrane that is of particular impor - tance for the mechanical properties of the cell . Here we reproduce the cellular cortex by activating actin ﬁlament growth on a solid surface . We unveil the existence of a sparse actin network that emanates from the surface and extends over a distance that is at least 10 times larger than the cortex itself . We call this sparse actin network the ‘‘actin cloud’’ and characterize its me - chanical properties with optical tweezers . We show , both experimentally and theoretically , that the actin cloud is mechanically relevant and that it should be taken into account because it can sustain forces as high as several picoNewtons ( pN ) . In particular , it is known that in plant cells , actin networks similar to the actin cloud have a role in positioning the nucleus ; in large oocytes , they play a role in driving chromosome movement . Recent evidence shows that such networks even prevent granule condensation in large cells . INTRODUCTION The actin cytoskeleton plays a major role in cellular me - chanics ( 1 ) , force generation ( 2 ) , and cell motility ( 3 ) . Its mechanical properties have been extensively studied in the past decades ( 4 ) . The detailed characterization and modeling of the actin cytoskeleton has proven to be a complex task , mainly due to the different structures formed by the actin biopolymer in cells . A major experimental approach to un - derstand the architecture and detailed properties of the actin cytoskeleton is to reconstitute the structures commonly found in cells using puriﬁed components ( 5 – 8 ) . Such controlled in vitro studies gave detailed insights into the me - chanical properties of cytoskeletal structures like actin bun - dles ( 9 ) , actin stress ﬁbers ( 10 ) , and cortical actin networks ( 7 , 11 ) . Of particular importance is the mechanical contribution of the actin cortex , which provides a mechanical barrier sup - porting the plasma membrane against extracellular forces , but also acts as a steric obstacle for intracellular organelles . The actin cortex in cells was estimated to extend over a thick - ness of a few hundred nanometers underneath the cell mem - brane ( 12 , 13 ) . However , actin structures connected with the actin cortex appear to be key elements for organelle positioning in plant cells ( 14 , 15 ) and nuclear positioning in oocytes ( 14 , 16 ) . Moreover , nuclear actin dynamics is involved in the movement of chromosomal foci in large cells like oocytes ( 17 ) . A recent study shows that such networks can even prevent the condensation of nuclear droplets in large cells ( 18 ) . How these actin networks could be connected to the cortex , and can we envision that they could emanate from the actin cortex , are the questions we address here . How this cortical actin network is nucleated at the mem - brane is still a debate ( 19 ) . Although ﬂuorescence techniques did not allow detection of the presence of the Arp2 / 3 com - plex and formins as a nucleating agent of the actin network at the membrane ( 20 ) , the branched structure that is observed under the plasma membrane hints for a contribution of Arp2 / 3 ( 12 ) . Therefore , it is important to understand how networks produced by the Arp2 / 3 complex branching mech - anism can impact cell mechanics and behavior . Such a branched and entangled actin network can be reproduced at the surface of beads covered with an activator of the Arp2 / 3 complex ( 11 ) . The thickness of such an actin network was detected by epiﬂuorescence microscopy and deﬁned as the distance of the bead surface from the half - maximum intensity position along a radial proﬁle . However , in these experiments , the drop of ﬂuorescence away from the bead is not abrupt as shown in Fig . 1 , A and B ( 11 ) . This is what we explore here , by characterizing the mechanical and struc - tural organization of this actin network further away from the zone detected by ﬂuorescence . Our experimental system , based on the high force sensitivity of optical tweezers ( see Fig . 1 C ) , allows detection of a mechanically relevant actin network that is inaccessible to direct visualization .

The originality of our work is that we show the Arp2 / 3 complex can give rise to a mechanically resistant actin cloud that spans over distances larger than the dense and branched network close to the Arp2 / 3 activation . We characterize its mechanical parameters and show that this actin cloud al - lows sustaining forces able to displace objects on a cellular length - scale . Our ﬁndings suggest that even a few ﬁlaments that may emanate from the actin cortex can lead to sufﬁcient resistance and can generate forces that may explain the role of actin in organelle positioning within the cell . Similar ﬁl - aments have been recently described to emanate from a nu - clear actin cortex in starﬁsh oocytes ( 21 ) . MATERIALS AND METHODS Proteins Products are obtained from Sigma - Aldrich ( St . Louis , MO ) , unless stated otherwise . Actin and the Arp2 / 3 complex are purchased from Cytoskeleton ( Denver , CO ) , and used without further puriﬁcation . Fluorescent Alexa - 488 actin is obtained from Molecular Probes ( Eugene , OR ) . Capping Protein ( CP ) , proﬁlin , and pVCA are puriﬁed as previously described in Bern - heim - Groswasser et al . ( 5 ) and Paluch et al . ( 22 ) . Monomeric actin contain - ing 10 % molar of labeled Alexa - 488 actin in G - Buffer ( 2 mM Tris , 0 . 2 mM CaCl2 , and 0 . 2 mM DTT , at pH 8 . 0 ) at a concentration of 40 m M is obtained by keeping the solution one night on ice at 4 (cid:1) C before experiments . Bead coating Carboxylated polystyrene beads ( Polysciences , Philadelphia , PA ) of 4 . 34 5 0 . 239 m m ( standard deviation , SD ) diameter were used for actin and probe beads . Probe beads Polystyrene beads are incubated for 20 min at 20 (cid:1) C under agitation with 10 mg / mL BSA at room temperature for 30 min in the working buffer ( pH 7 . 4 , 10 mM HEPES , 100 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl2 , 0 . 1 mM CaCl2 , 1 . 8 mM ATP , and 1 mg / mL BSA ) , and stored for a few days at 4 (cid:1) C . Actin beads Polystyrene beads are ﬁrst incubated for 20 min at 20 (cid:1) C under agitation with 2 m M pVCA and stored in working buffer ( as above ) for the day . Then they are placed in the polymerization mix , which is a solution of 4 m M G - actin , 12 m M proﬁlin , and 25 nM of Arp2 / 3 complex and various concentrations of CP ( 0 – 50 nM ) in the working buffer . A quantity of 15 m L of this mix is sealed between coverslips . Experimental procedure and data analysis For the bead approach experiments , the pVCA - coated beads , which will later polymerize actin , are mixed with BSA - passivated probe beads . Poly - merization of actin on the beads is triggered by adding the bead mixture to the polymerization mix . Approximately 15 m L of the mix is sealed between two coverslips and observed in an inverse microscope ( model No . IX71 ; Olympus , Melville , NY ) using a 60 (cid:3) water immersion objective ( NA ¼ 1 . 2 ) . Optical tweezers are used to trap and manipulate the beads in three di - mensions by the gradient forces of a focused infrared ﬁber laser ( l ¼ 1064 m m , YLP - 1 - 1064 ; IPG Photonics , Oxford , MA ) . The XY position and trap - ping forces are controlled by acousto - optical deﬂectors ( AA - Opto Elec - tronic , Orsay , France ) . Multiple traps are realized by time - sharing where the laser is switched within z 6 m s between two positions , while resting 20 m s on each position . Position and force applied on each bead are measured using a quadrant photodiode ( QPD ) positioned in the back focal plane of the condenser ( Fig . 1 ) . The trap stiffness is calibrated using the power spectral density of trapped beads ( 23 ) , and determined to be 34 pN / m m with the laser power of 119 mW as used during all experiments . The signal from the QPD is recorded with a sampling rate of 500 kHz using a commercial data acquisition card ( NI PCIe - 6363 ; National Instruments , Austin , TX ) , and processed using the software LABVIEW ( National Instruments ) and the software MATLAB ( The MathWorks , Natick , MA ) . Data acquisition and trap positioning are synchronized to recover the individual data for each bead . The signal from the QPD is converted to both the force exerted by the trap on the bead , and the bead position in the trap , thanks to previous calibration . To measure the viscoelastic properties , we perform a force - indentation experiment . An actin and a probe bead are selected , trapped , and checked for compromising adhesion to the upper or lower coverslip . The presence of the actin network is conﬁrmed using ﬂuorescence microscopy ( 200 - W mercury lamp ; Osram , Munich , Germany ) . All measurements are made on the dynamically polymerizing system , before symmetry breaking of the actin network . To avoid too - strong forces on the beads , which could push them out of the trap , single approach / retraction cycles were done while decreasing the minimal approach distance stepwise by 0 . 2 – 0 . 5 m m until the maximum FIGURE 1 Sketch describing the experimental situation : ( A ) Normalized intensityproﬁleof theﬂuorescent actincortex shown inpanel B , takenalong the bead diameter .

A1Winfraredﬁberlaser ( l ¼ 1064nm ; IPGPhotonics , Oxford , MA ) is steered by two acousto - optical deﬂectors ( AOD s ) and multi - plexed by time - sharing . The resulting beams are imaged in the back focal plane of a water immersion objective ( Obj1 , 60 (cid:3) , NA ¼ 1 . 2 ) , by a twofold magniﬁcation telescope ( with focal measurement of the L x lenses being f L 1 ¼ 10 cm , f L 2 ¼ 20 cm ) . The light is coupled in the optical path of a model No . IX71 microscope ( Olympus , Melville , NY ) by a dichroic mirror ( DM ) . After interaction with the beads , the light is collected by a water immersion objective ( Obj2 , 40 (cid:3) , NA ¼ 0 . 9 ) and the back focal plane of Obj2 is imaged onto a quadrant - photodiode ( QPD ) via two lenses ( f L 3 ¼ 6 cm , f L 4 ¼ 3 cm ) . ( D ) Thelaserstraptheactinbead ( left ) andtheprobebead . Duringtheexper - iments , the probe bead is approaching the actin bead and moved from an initial position ( transparent , right ) to a ﬁnal position at a velocity v , resting 3 s at the closest proximity ( middle ) and retracting back to the original posi - tion ( movementindicatedbythe purplearrow ) . Thedisplacementofthetwo beadsfromtheirrespectivetrapcenter ( markedbya straightline ) isrecorded by the QPD during the whole time . Optical forces are calculated using the calibrated trap stiffness . Biophysical Journal 107 ( 4 ) 854 – 862 Detection of a Long - Range Actin Network 855 force reached 8 – 10 pN . In these conditions , the experimental protocol was stable and multiple consecutive approach experiments were done . For the approach phase , the three ﬁt parameters ( a , b , and d ) are esti - mated using a Levenberg - Marquardt algorithm as provided by MATLAB . To facilitate stability in the ﬁt algorithms , distances are expressed in micro - meters and forces in pN . Phenomenological ﬁt of retraction curve To ﬁt the retracting part , we introduce the function A ð d Þ ¼ R b ð d c Þ a with R : 0 % R % 1 ; which corresponds to the elastic part of the actin - cloud , and is hence the discussed forces - distance curve ( Eq . 2 ) scaled with the relaxation R , as described in the main text ( see Fig . S4 , dashed line in the Supporting Material , and Eq . 9 ) . A ( d ) is fully determined from the approach and the relaxation data . For the plot in the retraction phase , we use the difference between the actual data and the expected elastic forces A ( d ) to estimate the force that results from the actin cloud that has closed behind the bead . This is attributed to a second power - law function B ð d Þ ¼ (cid:4) Z ð d c Þ w ( see Fig . S4 , red ) , which is ﬁtted to the difference between the measured force during the retraction and A ( d ) for the long distance ( after force minimum is when the retraction phase was reached ) . To determine the curve plotted later in Fig . 4 , we smoothly converge from A ( d ) to B ( d ) by using a the smoothing function S ð x Þ ¼ R R ð 1 (cid:4) ð x (cid:4) t Þ 2 Þ (cid:3) L ð t Þ dt ; which corresponds to a convolution between the projected bead area and a linear ramp function L that is 0 for t % 0 and 1 for t R 1 .

Beads coated with pVCA are then placed in the mix of puriﬁed proteins , containing 25 nM of the Arp2 / 3 complex , 4 m M actin , 12 m M proﬁlin , and various amounts of CP . In these conditions , a network of actin ﬁlaments grows from the bead surface . In the following , these beads , once covered with their actin network , are called ‘‘actin beads’’ ( Fig . 2 A ) . In the absence of CP , actin ﬁlaments grow with their barbed ends away from the surface ( 24 ) . The presence of CP limits the ﬁlament growth . In a spherical geometry of a bead , a stress builds up because new branches are formed at the surface of the bead , and symmetry breaks in a concen - tration range of CP from 15 to 35 nM ( 11 , 25 ) . The choice of a bead diameter of 4 . 3 m m allows us to perform measurements on an actin network that is homoge - neous in the angular direction—hence , before the appear - ance of heterogeneities that are a signature of symmetry breaking ( Fig . 1 B ) . A characteristic symmetry - breaking time for those beads is indeed ~ 20 min ( 11 ) .

We use this distance , d 0 , as the actin cloud size for the presented analysis . However , it should be noted that this measure may depend on the measurement method and the size of the probe beads .

Biophysical Journal 107 ( 4 ) 854 – 862 856 Bussonnier et al . experiments are performed before symmetry - breaking , both the actin gel and the actin cloud are still growing , and no steady state has been reached . However , as previously inves - tigated ( 11 ) , the growth velocity is small , with ~ 0 . 1 m m / min , so that during the 2 min required for the approach experi - ments the actin - gel growth of ~ 200 nm is negligible compared to the typical distances of ~ 10 m m studied in this work . Experiment description Using optical tweezers , the probe bead is moved toward an actin bead . The forces on each bead are monitored , as shown in Fig . 1 C . Time - shared optical tweezers are used to trap the probe - and actin - beads ( see Materials and Methods for more details ( 26 ) ) . The displacement of each bead from its trap center is recorded using a QPD , as shown in Fig . 1 C . For further analysis , we exclusively use forces determined from the stationary trap that holds the actin bead to avoid systematic errors that might arise from the trap displace - ment . The absence of interaction between bead and glass coverslip is probed before each experiment by moving it in all directions using the tweezers . A typical experiment starts as follows : the distance between traps is at least set to 20 m m , and beads are positioned at the trap centers . Then , the probe trap approaches the actin bead at a constant velocity of v ¼ 10 m m / s ( 0 % t % t 1 ; Fig . 2 A , left ) . During this process , as soon as the actin bead feels the force exerted by the probe bead , it becomes off - centered in its trap ( Fig . 2 A , t ( t 1 ) . The approach phase is followed by two other phases , a relaxation phase ( t 1 < t < t 2 ; Fig . 2 A , center , white back - ground ) , and a retraction phase ( t 2 < t < t 3 ; Fig . A , right , light yellow background ) . During the retraction phase , the probe bead returns to its initial position with the same absolute velocity of 10 m m / s as in the approach phase . The duration of the relaxation phase ( t 2 (cid:4) t 1 ¼ 3 s ) is chosen to be long enough to allow relaxation to happen , and short enough for actin polymerization not to change the properties of the network . The time - dependent force on the actin bead ( Fig . 2 A ) is converted into a force - distance curve as shown in Fig . 2 , B and C , where d is the distance between the sur - faces of the actin bead and the probe bead . The force dis - tance curve Fig . 2 B reads as follows : i ) ( t % t 1 ) the force between beads starts from an asymptotic zero value at long distance and increases as the distance decreases ( green points ) . ii ) ( t 1 % t % t 2 ) the probe bead stops and relaxation occurs . During the relaxation , the force decreases with a very little distance decrease ( red points , top left in Fig . 2 B ) . iii ) ( t 2 % t % t 3 ) the force decreases , becomes negative , and eventually reaches asymptotically zero again when distance increases ( blue points ) . Those curves are repeatable and show only small changes if multiple approach - retraction cycles are probed ( see Fig . 2 C ) . Previous experiments suggest that for frequencies > 0 . 1 Hz , viscous relaxation becomes comparable to the elastic properties ( 27 ) . To check the importance of stress relaxation during the approach phase , we verify that the probe trap velocity did not affect the force - distance curves , by performing experiments at variable velocities ranging from 5 to 30 m m / s ( see Fig . S1 ) . These experiments did not show any striking differences in the recorded measure - ments ; hence , for the analysis of the approach phase , we use an elastic model . EXPERIMENTAL OBSERVATIONS Approach phase The bead system provides a way to reconstruct actin cortices in vitro . Moreover , these reconstituted systems can be manip - ulated to investigate three - dimensional mechanical properties of a biomimetic actin cortex in experimental conditions inaccessible to other microscopy techniques that are typically used to investigate single actin ﬁlament dynamics , like total internal reﬂection . Optical tweezer and force measurements on the bead allow us to precisely probe for the actin network emanating from a bead in a three - dimensional environment . To approximate the size of the actin cloud , we determine the distance d 0 ( Table 1 , Fig . 2 B , dotted lines ) where the forces ontheprobedbeadbecomehigherthantheexperimentalnoiseoftheforcedetection ( 2 pN ) . The found values for d 0 remain large compared to the ﬂuorescent actin gel thickness . Indeed , the probe bead already feels the presence of actin ﬁlaments at a distance from 13 to ~ 4 m m ( Fig . 1 , A and B ; Table 1 ) . This distance depends on CP concentration ( Table 1 ) , but is always much larger than 1 m m . This has been established as an upper estimation of the actin network thickness e , previ - ouslymeasured as the distance ofhalf - maximum ﬂuorescence intensity ( 11 ) and Fig . 1 A . As the bead distance decreases , the force gradually in - creases , until the trap stops at the minimal displacement distance . The force - distance data are ﬁtted by a power - law with ﬁt parameters b , a , and d ( Fig . 2 , A and B ) , F ð d Þ ¼ b (cid:3) ð d (cid:4) d Þ a ; ( 2 ) where we obtain a high ﬁt quality measured by a median R 2 ¼ 0 . 97 . Because the power - law exponent , a , is found to be negative ( Table 1 ) , d corresponds to the offset distance between bead surfaces at which the force would diverge ( vertical black line in Fig . 2 B ) . We experimentally ﬁnd a negative power - law exponent close to (cid:4) 1 with a statistical distribution of h a i ¼ (cid:4) 1 . 10 5 0 . 38 ( n ¼ 103 , mean 5 SD ) for all CP concentrations probed ( Fig . 2 D , inset ) . This inverse relation hints for a far - reaching network , or actin cloud , which is mechanically evidenced here . In our experiments , it is detectable over distances that are larger than the ﬂuorescence - estimated thickness of ~ 1 m m ( see Movie S1 in the Supporting Material ) . Biophysical Journal 107 ( 4 ) 854 – 862 Detection of a Long - Range Actin Network 857 Due to the scale invariance of the power - law , we can collapse all 103 experimental curves into a single master curve by normalizing the force with the point of maximal force ( F max ) reached at t 1 , and the distance between bead surface at the minimal approach ( d t 1 , Fig . 2 D ) . This re - scaling procedure allows us to determine the power - law exponent of all averaged data curves to be ( a rs ¼ (cid:4) 1 . 06 ) , which conﬁrms the (cid:4) 1 exponent . Nonlinear elastic modulus To determine the Young’s modulus from the force - distance curves , we use its deﬁnition as given by Hooke’s law : E ¼ s / u , where s ¼ F / ( p R 2 ) is the stress on the projected bead surface , R is the bead radius , u ¼ ( d c – x ) / d c is the strain where we deﬁne d c ¼ ( d – d ) , and x is the experimentally controlled bead position for the small deformations . Hence du ¼ (cid:4) dx / d c , where the minus sign reﬂects the choice of the coordinate system for the deformation , which has to be consistent with the direction of the force to ensure a positive elastic modulus . Here we study the situation in which a pre - deformation of the gel of d c is applied , and then we apply a stress s and strain u when displacing the probe bead by a small distance . In such a situation , the global Young’s modulus as function of d c reads E ( d c ) ¼ ( d s / du ) j dc . The deformation - dependent Young’s modulus can hence be ex - pressed as the derivative of the force , with respect to the deformation at the distance d c , to yield E ð d c Þ ¼ (cid:4) d c p R 2 (cid:3) (cid:2) dF dx (cid:3) j x ¼ d c ; ( 3 ) ¼ E 0 (cid:3) d a c ; ( 4 ) where E 0 ¼ (cid:4) ab / ( p R 2 ) . In this expression , we use the ﬁt function of Eq . 2 to calculate the derivative . Interestingly , us - ing the strain at a position d c gives rise to the same power - law between the nonlinear Young’s modulus and the measured force . It should be noted that , experimentally , we can only ac - cess the average mechanical properties between the probe - and the actin bead . Hence , all reported values present mean values of the material between these two beads . The dis - cussed model describes the reported mean values , and assumes an effectively averaged Young’s modulus . Here E ( d c ) is then this global Young’s modulus that measures the material properties of the actin cloud that is conﬁned between the two beads . These values ( Table 1 ) are three orders - of - magnitude smaller than the elasticity of the actin gel gener - ated from an Arp2 / 3 - activated bead ( known to be z 1 kPa ( 28 ) ) . This large difference in rigidity might explain why the actin cloud was not observed in previous mechanical measurements such as micropipette , microneedle deforma - tion , or atomic - force microscopy indentation that were sensi - tiveto largeforces in the nanoNewton ( nN ) regime . However , such small moduli are commonly found in loosely entangled actin networks ( 27 ) . It also shows that the actin cloud is of a fundamentally different network type , resulting in such a drastic change of mechanical properties compared to the dense actin gel found at the bead surface . Optical tweezers are the optimal measurement technique to determine such small elastic parameters . Relaxation phase In the 3 s resting phase , we observe that the beads move to - ward the center of their traps , corresponding to a force relax - ation ( Fig . 2 A , central ) during which the beads get closer to each other ( Fig . 2 A , t ¼ t 1 and t ¼ t 2 ) . The force - drop during the relaxation is typically of 20 % ( see Fig . S3 ) . Retraction phase We observe a rapid decrease of the force toward negative forces , leading to two different behaviors that may add up : 1 . A general tendency is that the rapid drop of the force is followed by a slow force increase through an inﬂection point ( Fig . 2 B , lower curve ) , and 2 . In z 25 % of the experiments , we ﬁnd evidence of rapid detachments that are identiﬁed by a sawtooth shape of the force - distance curve ( see Fig . S2 ) . Irreversibility An important ﬁnding is that the approach phase does not su - perimpose with the relaxation and retraction phases , which indicates dissipation of energy during a cycle of approach and retraction . Apart from the relaxation phase , a contri - bution to this dissipation is the negative force that is re - miniscent of the sticky behavior similar to atomic - force microscopy indentation / retraction experiments .

Inﬂuence of Capping Protein ( CP ) concentration Actin ﬁlament length is controlled by the amount of CP in the protein mix ( 24 ) . To check the inﬂuence of the CP con - centration on the actin cloud we analyze experiments at 0 , 10 , 30 , and 50 nM CP . As shown in Fig . 3 and Table 1 , the value of the power - law exponent a does not change signiﬁcantly with CP concentration . In contrast , we ﬁnd that the distance offset d changes under variable conditions and the parameter b decreases ﬁvefold when CP concentra - tion increases from 0 to 50 nM . DISCUSSION Approach phase : interpretation of the power - law To further investigate this power - law exponent ( of x (cid:4) 1 ) , we model the deformation of the actin cloud by the estab - lished theory of semiﬂexible , entangled polymer networks ( 29 – 31 ) . In the approach phase , we focus on the elastic properties quantiﬁed by the deformation - dependent Young’s modulus E ( d c ) and neglect any viscous term , given that the force in this phase does not depend signiﬁcantly on the approach speed . The Young’s modulus E of semiﬂexible ﬁl - aments is well studied and can be expressed as a function of ﬁlament contour length density r and the entanglement length L e as E ¼ 2 $ ( 1 þ n ) $ 7 $ k B T r / ( 5 L e ) ( 31 ) . The prefac - tor is model - dependent and includes the transition from shear to Young’s modulus using the Poisson ratio . Previous studies have investigated the nonlinear stiffening of actin gels for large deformations comparable to the presented approach protocol ( 32 ) . For actin concentrations similar to the concentration used in our study , these previous experi - ments show that a linear description holds , and hence the proposed model should correctly describe the mechanics of the polymer network . The entanglement length itself can be expressed as a function of density r and persistence length L p as L e z L p 1 / 5 r (cid:4) 2 / 5 ( 31 ) . For the general case of a compressible material , the only variable that might change under the strong deformation is r / r ( d c ) . Hence , we can express the Young’s modulus as a function of density r that depends on the compression of the network , therefore noted r ( d c ) : E ð d c Þ ¼ ð 1 þ n Þ $ 14 $ k B T 5 L 1 = 5 p (cid:3) ð r ð d c ÞÞ 7 = 5 : ( 5 ) Using the experimentally found power - law , Eq . 5 allows us to infer a relation for the density r f d c 5 / 7 (cid:3) a . Using the scaling arguments that at the distance d 0 , which corresponds to the undeformed actin cloud , the density is r 0 , we can directly express r ( d c ) ¼ r 0 ( d c / d 0 ) 5 / 7 (cid:3) a . These changes in the density can be also used to estimate the Poisson’s ratio of the actin cloud , which connects the distance - dependent density and the deformation by r ( d c ) ¼ r 0 ( d c / d 0 ) 2 n (cid:4) 1 . Hence , we infer for Poisson’s ratio : n ¼ 1 / 2 ( 1 þ 5 / 7 a ) . Due to the deﬁnition of r that corresponds to the ﬁlament contour length per unit volume , we can determine the average mesh - size x 0 of the undeformed network by r 0 ¼ 1 / x 20 . Combining these expressions then leads to E ð d c Þ ¼ ð 1 þ n Þ $ 14 $ k B T 5 L 1 = 5 p x 14 = 5 0 d a 0 (cid:3) d a c ; ( 6 ) ¼ E 0 0 (cid:3) d a c : ( 7 ) To determine the expected mesh - size , we can set E 0 as found in Eq . 3 , equal to Eq . 6 : x 0 ¼ 0 BB @ (cid:4) (cid:2) 2 (cid:4) 5 7 a (cid:3) : k B T p R 2 5 ab L 15 p d a 0 1 CCA 514 : ( 8 ) The resulting values of x 0 are listed in Table 1 , which are ~ 0 . 3 – 0 . 4 m m . Such average values are consistent with other rheology experiments and have been described in Morse ( 31 ) . Unlike previous studies of bulk actin networks that ﬁnd a bulk Poisson ratio of 0 . 5 for actin gels formed at actin concentration of 21 . 5 m M ( 27 ) , we ﬁnd that the actin cloud can almost collapse under the applied forces , with approxi - mated Poisson’s ratio of 0 . 1 – 0 . 2 . The difference may be ex - plained by the lower actin concentration ( 4 m M ) or by the geometrical arrangement of the actin network used in our experiments . Approach phase : interpretation of distance offset d The third ﬁt parameter in the power - law of Eq . 2 is d , which marks the position at which the power - law diverges . Because the actin network around the bead is known to have an elastic modulus of z 1 kPa ( 28 , 33 ) , the forces 2 . 5 2 . 0 1 . 5 1 . 0 0 . 5 0 10 30 50 [ CP ] μM 0 10 20 30 β ( p N μ m ) FIGURE 3 Distribution of power exponent a and prefactor b for different concentrations in CP ( see Table 1 ) . ( Box plot , blue line ) Mean ; ( box limit ) ﬁrst ( q 1 ) and third ( q 3 ) quartiles ; ( whiskers ) extension to the most extreme data point within the 1 . 5 (cid:3) ( q 3 – q 1 ) data range . None of the values of a are statistically different than the value for [ CP ] ¼ 50 m M . Biophysical Journal 107 ( 4 ) 854 – 862 Detection of a Long - Range Actin Network 859 provided by our optical tweezers ( maximum 30 pN ) are un - able to deform this network . This suggests that in our mea - surements , the actin network close to the bead acts as a rigid object , which in turn suggests interpreting d as the thickness of the actin network deﬁned by epiﬂuorescence ( Fig . 1 B ) . As shown in Table 1 , d decreases with increasing CP con - centration . The determined values of z 1 – 2 m m are consis - tent with previous measurements of the actin thickness e by ﬂuorescence microscopy ( 11 ) . This general dependence is not found in the absence of CP , where the system is in a completely different regime because the ﬁlament growth away from the bead is only limited by the amount of G - actin . Indeed , in the absence of Capping Protein , ﬁlaments grow mainly away from the bead ( 11 ) , leading to the absence of symmetry breaking . Therefore , without CP it remains difﬁcult to deﬁne an actin shell thickness . The increasing number of ﬁlaments growing away from the bead surface changes the overall structure of the gel , which does not allow interpretation of d . Relaxation phase The apparent mechanical effect of the actin cloud shows a dominant elastic component , while the force - distance plot gives a signiﬁcant dissipation marked by the hysteresis . The repeatable approach - retraction excludes a signiﬁcant plastic deformation , like breakage of the ﬁlaments or rupture of the sparse actin network . To understand the relax - ation and the retraction behavior , we further follow the approach inspired by Morse ( 31 ) , and investigate the pro - posed relaxation function c ( t ) , which determines the time dependence of E ( t ) ¼ E (cid:3) c ( t ) , c ð t Þ ¼ X n ; odd 8 n 2 p 2 exp (cid:4) (cid:4) n 2 p 2 t (cid:5) t rep (cid:6) ; ( 9 ) where t rep ¼ l 2 f = D rep : In this model , the relaxation is a sum of exponential decays with well - deﬁned decay times for a reptation - dominated relaxation . The unknown parameters are the diffusion constant for ﬁlament reptation D rep and the ﬁlament length l f , which are combined in the single ﬁt parameter ( t rep ) . We limit the ﬁt to the ﬁrst 40 terms of the sum in Eq . 9 , because the higher modes relax faster that can be observed with the experimental resolution . Such a sum of exponentials remains consistent with the common ﬁnding of a power - law behavior of the shear modulus in in vitro actin networks ( 27 ) and the relaxation behavior found in cells ( 34 ) . To check whether the resulting ﬁt parameter gives real - istic values , we estimate D rep ¼ k B T = ð g l f Þ ; where g z 2 ph s = ln ð x = d f Þ is the friction coefﬁcient per unit length that depends on the solvent viscosity h s ; the mesh - size x , which has been estimated in Eq . 8 ; and the ﬁlament diameter d f . We can also use h s ¼ 10 (cid:4) 3 Pa (cid:3) s , d f ¼ 7 nm and the mesh - size of ~ 400 nm . Knowing the value of the relaxation parameter t rep given by the ﬁt , we can estimate the ﬁlament length l f from the two previous expressions in the different CP conditions and determine values of ~ 3 – 8 m m ( see Table 1 ) . Interestingly , these values are very close to the size of the actin cloud d 0 , which we determine independently by the ﬁrst measurable mechanical signature of the cloud . Hence , the found values of the ﬁt are directly consistent with the predictions of a decrease of ﬁlament length when CP concentration is increased ( 24 ) . The model of entangled actin ﬁlaments can therefore explain both the approach and the relaxation phases . Retraction phase During the retraction phase , we observe two types of events : 1 . Sticking events ( see Fig . S2 ) , where the force becomes abruptly negative until a threshold value is reached and then quickly relaxes ; and 2 . A continuous decrease of the force that becomes negative after an average retraction of 3 . 5 m m and returns to zero at large distances . Although the sticking event can be explained by interac - tion between the probe bead and the actin , the second case can be modeled phenomenologically by assuming a partial closure of the actin network behind the bead , as sketched in Fig . 4 ( right part of the graph ) . The details of the ﬁt func - tion are given in the Materials and Methods . Brieﬂy , we as - sume a transition between the elastic force generated by the actin cloud between the two beads and an additional visco - elastic contribution that accounts for the partially closed actin cloud behind the bead during the resting phase . Biological relevance of the actin cloud emanating from cortical actin The actin cytoskeleton is involved in many cellular events spanning from setting cell shape to the regulation of gene expression . Further experiments hint for a possible direct mechanical transmission of forces from the outside toward the nucleus via the actin cytoskeleton . Because the actin cytoskeleton is already known to be important in the posi - tioning of the nucleus and presents a force transmission role in cells , it can be speculated that such force transmis - sion may directly or indirectly trigger changes in gene expression . The mechanical link from extracellular environ - ment to the nucleus is established by actin bundles that con - nect integrins and proteins of the nuclear envelope ( 35 ) . However , to explain the role of actin in organelle and nu - cleus positioning ( 14 , 15 ) , more than just such actin bundles should be taken into account . Our experiments highlight that an actin network emanating from the actin cortex can sustain forces in the range of 10 pN . A force of 10 pN is sufﬁcient for dragging Biophysical Journal 107 ( 4 ) 854 – 862 860 Bussonnier et al . organelles inside cells . Moreover , the capacity of Arp2 / 3 branched networks to reorganize in parallel structure , as well as nucleators as formins ( 6 ) , can allow a constantly polymerizing cortical network to push throughout the inside of a cell and exert sufﬁcient forces to move organelles and chromosomes ( 17 ) . Indeed , networks observed inside cells are generally anchored to the cortical actin network ( 14 , 36 – 38 ) . Because we show that mechanical parameters of ﬁlaments far away from nucleation sites may sustain forces up to 15 pN , we anticipate that unbranched actin ﬁl - aments connected to cortical actin may provide a mechani - cal scaffold for a general mechanism of positioning and long - range interplay between organelles in oocytes ( 39 , 40 ) or even in large - scale systems like Drosophila development ( 16 ) . Recently , the role of an actin network with similar properties as the here - described actin cloud had been iden - tiﬁed in large cells such as Xenopus oocytes , which directly shows the mechanical relevance of the actin cloud in intra - cellular organization ( 18 ) . CONCLUSION The transition from a dense actin network , which is poly - merized off an Arp2 / 3 complex - activated surface to the bulk medium , is not abrupt . We identify and characterize a large transition zone , the actin cloud . These actin clouds are very soft compared to the dense actin network that is formed at the location of the Arp2 / 3 complex activation . Our in vitro experiments show that this actin cloud also gives a mechanical support with a far - reaching mechanical effect that scales inversely to the distance , a property that can be explained by polymer theory . The predicted visco - elastic properties and extracted material properties are in good agreement with our measurements . The actin cloud cannot be ignored in the context of cellular events such as nucleus positioning and oocyte maturation that have been shown to happen on force scales of several pN ( 18 ) . More - over , we enlighten a general mechanical feature of sparse actin networks that can serve as a useful mechanism to displace and organize the different cellular compartments .
