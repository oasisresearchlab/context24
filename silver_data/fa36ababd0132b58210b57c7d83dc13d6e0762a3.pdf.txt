Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol 289 : L489 – L496 , 2005 . First published May 20 , 2005 ; doi : 10 . 1152 / ajplung . 00074 . 2005 . —We developed a heterologous system to study the effect of mechanical deformation on alveolar epithelial cells . First , isolated primary rat alveolar type II ( ATII ) cells were plated onto silastic substrata coated with ﬁbronectin and main - tained in culture under conditions where they become alveolar type I - like ( ATI ) cells . This was followed by a second set of ATII cells labeled with the nontransferable , vital ﬂuorescent stain 5 - chlorometh - ylﬂuorescein diacetate to distinguish them from ATI cells . By mor - phometric analysis , equibiaxial deformation ( stretch ) of the silastic substratum induced comparable changes in cell surface area for both ATII and ATI cells . Surfactant lipid secretion was measured using cells metabolically labeled with [ 3 H ] choline . In response to 21 % tonic stretch for 15 min , ATII cells seeded with ATI cells secreted nearly threefold more surfactant lipid compared with ATII cells seeded alone . ATI cells did not secrete lipid in response to stretch . The enhanced lipid secretion by ATII plus ATI cocultures was inhibited by treatment with apyrase and adenosine deaminase , suggesting that ATP release by ATI cells enhanced surfactant lipid secretion at 21 % stretch . This was conﬁrmed using a luciferase assay where , in re - sponse to 21 % stretch , ATI cells released fourfold more ATP than ATII cells . Because ATI cells release signiﬁcantly more ATP at a lower level of stretch than ATII cells , this supports the hypothesis that ATI cells are mechanosensors in the lung and that paracrine stimula - tion of ATII cells by extracellular ATP released from ATI cells plays a role in regulating surfactant secretion . pulmonary surfactant ; alveolar epithelia ; phosphatidylcholine ; pneu - mocytes ; adenosine 5 ' - triphosphate TYPE II ALVEOLAR EPITHELIAL CELLS secrete pulmonary surfactant in response to mechanical deformation ( 26 , 59 ) . However , the adult alveolar epithelium is a mixed monolayer consisting of type I and type II cells . Although type II cells outnumber type I cells by a 2 : 1 ratio in the normal lung , (cid:1) 90 % of the alveolar surface is covered by large , ﬂat type I cells that serve as the surface for gas exchange with the external environment ( 18 ) . Virtually all type II cells are in direct contact with type I cells , suggesting that the type II - type I cell interface may have a role in regulating alveolar function ( 39 ) . Using in situ ﬂuorescence microscopy , Ashino et al . ( 3 ) demonstrated that type I cells serve as mechanosensors in the lung . In response to hyperinﬂation , a transient increase in cytosolic calcium was initiated by type I cells , which was then transmitted to type II cells through gap junctions . This in turn stimulated lamellar body - plasma membrane fusion by type II cells , as measured by release of LysoTracker dye preloaded into the lamellar bodies . Consistent with this , mixed cultures of isolated alveolar epithelial cells with type II - like ( ATII ) and type I - like ( ATI ) phenotypes form functional gap junctions with the capacity to transmit mechanically initiated calcium transients from one cell type to another ( 2 , 33 , 36 ) . On the other hand , calcium transients can also be transmitted to ATII cells by extracellular ATP through subsequent paracrine stim - ulation of purinergic receptors ( 37 ) . ATP is a potent secretagogue that stimulates type II cell surfactant secretion ( 22 , 27 , 41 , 49 ) . Pharmacological and molecular evidence supports the expression of P2Y 2 receptors by type II cells ( 27 , 48 ) . However , alveolar epithelial cells also express P2X - type purinergic receptors ( 45 , 60 ) . In addition to ATP , agents that stimulate cAMP formation , including aden - osine and adenosine analogs , enhance surfactant secretion through PKA - dependent pathways ( 29 , 32 ) . Although secretion of surfactant lipid by type II cells in response to purines and other agonists has been pharmacologically well characterized ( 49 ) , little is known about the origin of extracellular ATP in the alveolus . To date , the mechanical stimulation of surfactant lipid se - cretion by ATII cells in vitro has been examined only in monocultures . To mimic elements of a native alveolar epithe - lium , we used a coculture model based on two separate isola - tions of rat alveolar epithelial cells . The ﬁrst preparation consisted of alveolar epithelial cells cultured under conditions where they lose type II cell markers ( e . g . , surfactant proteins ) and gain expression of type I cell markers ( including T1 (cid:2) and aquaporin - 5 ) , which we refer to as ATI cells . Although ATI cells generated from cultured ATII cells are not bona ﬁde type I cells ( 31 ) , they are a practical model system that expresses several hundred genes in common with type I cells and that has similar morphology ( 10 – 12 , 19 , 31 , 39 , 43 , 45 , 55 , 58 ) . The second preparation consisted of freshly isolated ATII cells ﬂuorescently labeled to distinguish them from the ATI cells . This second isolation was seeded onto the ATI monolayer to create an alveolar epithelial coculture model . We found that surfactant lipid secretion by ATII cells cocultured with ATI cells was more sensitive to stretch than ATII cells alone . This was due to stretch - stimulated ATP release by ATI cells and suggests a paracrine pathway to stimulate surfactant release . Address for reprint requests and other correspondence : M .

Animal protocols were reviewed and authorized by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Pennsylvania . Sprague - Dawley rat ATII cells were isolated from lavaged , perfused lungs by elastase digestion using the method of Dobbs et al . ( 23 ) with modiﬁcations ( 1 ) . With the use of this approach , preparations routinely contained 90 – 95 % ATII cells ( 1 ) . Cells were cultured in Earle’s MEM ( Life Technologies , Rockville , MD ) con - taining 10 % FBS , 25 (cid:3) g / ml gentamicin , and 0 . 25 (cid:3) g / ml amphotericin B ( Life Technologies ) at a seeding density of 1 (cid:4) 10 6 cells / cm 2 on either tissue culture - treated plastic or on custom - made wells contain - ing a deformable silastic substratum coated with 10 (cid:3) g / cm 2 of ﬁbronectin ( Boehringer Mannheim Biochemicals ) as previously de - scribed ( 55 ) . Cell attachment was limited to the central portion of each well by placing a piece of Tygon tubing in the center of each well and seeding cells only within this restricted area . Cells were studied 1 ) after overnight culture ( ATII ) or 2 ) after 5 – 6 days ( ATI cells ) or 3 ) the ATI cells were used for coculture experiments . For cocultures , a second preparation of ATII cells was made using the protocol de - scribed above except isolated ATII cells in suspension were labeled with medium containing 10 (cid:3) M CellTracker Green 5 - chloromethyl - ﬂuorescein diacetate ( CMFDA ; Invitrogen - Molecular Probes , Eu - gene , OR ) . Under these conditions , CMFDA permeates into the cells and covalently binds to proteins , providing a vital , nontransferable ﬂuorescent stain that remains speciﬁcally associated with the second set of ATII cells ( 44 ) . CMFDA - labeled ATII cells were cultured alone or were cultured on plates or substrata containing preexisting ATI cells ( plating density (cid:5) 1 (cid:4) 10 6 cells / cm 2 ) . Using FITC - anti - cyto - keratin ( Sigma ) as an epithelial cell marker and Cy3 - anti - vimentin ( Sigma ) as a ﬁbroblast marker , we found that ATI cell preparations contained 86 . 5 (cid:6) 7 . 9 % epithelial cells ( n (cid:5) 6 ﬁelds , 2 independent preparations ) . Expression of type I cell markers by these ATI cells was previously demonstrated ( 55 ) . Quantitative ﬂuorescence and microscopy . To determine whether cell - associated CMFDA ﬂuorescence was a linear function of cell number , a speciﬁc number of ATII cells was plated into a multiwell tissue culture dish and cultured overnight , and then CMFDA ﬂuores - cence was measured using a PE Biosystems microplate ﬂuorometer ( excitation : 485 nm , emission : 535 nm ) . The relative ﬂuorescence units ( RFU ) were correlated to the input number of ATII cells . A similar method was used to quantify ATII cell number in cocultures stimulated with ATP . For cocultures on silastic substrata , cells were imaged by phase - contrast and ﬂuorescence microscopy using an Olympus IX70 with a U - MWIBA ﬁlter pack ( BP460 – 490 , DM505 , BA515 - 550 ) . Images were acquired using Image Pro software and threshold ﬁltered to select areas with ﬂuorescent cells , which were then quantiﬁed to give the fraction of the surface covered by CMFDA - labeled cells . Changes in cell area in response to mechanical deformation were determined by morphometric analysis . Cells were cultured on silastic substrata contained in a plastic well device that allowed equibiaxial mechanical stretch of the substratum ( 55 ) ( see Fig . 3 ) . The top piece of the device was mounted into a threaded holder and manually turned to lower the substratum onto a hollow ring - shaped indentor . More rotations lowered the substratum a greater amount onto the indentor ; in other words , more turns resulted in greater stretch of the substra - tum . Cells in coculture were imaged by phase - contrast and ﬂuores - cence microscopy , and the change in cell surface area as a function of number of turns was determined using Image Pro by manually tracing cell outlines and morphometric analysis of cell area . Assay for secreted surfactant lipid . Cells were incubated overnight in medium containing 0 . 5 mCi [ 3 H ] choline chloride . The cells were then washed , the medium was replaced , and the cells were incubated at 37°C for a 30 - min recovery period . An aliquot of medium was removed as a baseline control , and then surfactant secretion was stimulated by adding ATP from a 100 (cid:4) concentrated stock ( 1 mM ﬁnal concentration ) followed by a 2 - h incubation at 37°C , conditions previously optimized for ATP - stimulated surfactant lipid release ( 5 , 28 ) . For mechanical deformation , cells were stretched by the indicated amount for 15 min and then relaxed and further incubated at 37°C for 2 h total ( 59 ) . Unstimulated cells in parallel cultures were used as controls . Lipids were isolated from medium and cell fractions by Bligh - Dyer extraction and measured by liquid scintillation counting as previously described ( 5 ) . The amount of surfactant [ 3 H ] phosphatidyl - choline ( [ 3 H ] PC ) in the medium was normalized to total radiolabeled lipid ( medium (cid:7) cells ) or to CMFDA ﬂuorescence as determined above . To inhibit receptor stimulation by secreted ATP , cells were prein - cubated for 30 min and mechanically stimulated in the presence of a mixture of 20 U / ml apyrase ( A - 6535 ; Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) and 5 U / ml adenosine deaminase ( ADA ; A - 5168 , Sigma ) to metabolize ATP and adenosine to an inactive form ( inosine ) . Some experiments were done using cells treated with apyrase alone . To inhibit gap junctional communication , cells were pretreated for 30 min and mechanically stimulated in the presence of either a mixture of con - nexin mimetic peptides ( 160 (cid:3) M GAP - 26 (cid:7) 130 (cid:3) M GAP - 27 ) ( 24 ) or 40 (cid:3) M (cid:8) - glycyrrhetinic acid ( 20 ) . To measure gap junctional communication between ATI cells , a glass micropipette containing 2 mg / ml of Alexa Fluor 488 ( Molecular Probes ) in water was used to microinject a single cell in a ﬁeld , and the diffusion of Alexa 488 by gap junctional intercellular communication was assessed as the num - ber of cells containing ﬂuorescent dye after a 3 - min incubation period ( 40 ) . A cell was scored as positive if it had a representative area with an average ﬂuorescence intensity of at least 10 % of the microinjected cell ﬂuorescence intensity as determined with Image Pro . ATI - ATII cell communication was measured using the preloading assay as previously described ( 2 ) . ATP concentration measurements . ATII cells alone or ATI cells alone on deformable substrata were washed and the culture medium was replaced with 2 ml of serum - free Earle’s MEM containing 100 (cid:3) M ARL - 67156 to inhibit extracellular ATP degradation by ectoen - zymes ( 17 , 38 ) . A 50 - (cid:3) l aliquot of medium was harvested , frozen , and stored at (cid:9) 20°C . The cells were then stretched by the indicated amount for 10 min , and a second 50 - (cid:3) l aliquot of medium was harvested and frozen . Care was taken to avoid disrupting the cell monolayer while obtaining aliquots of medium for the ATP assay . Medium ATP concentration was detected with the chemiluminescent luciferin - luciferase assay using previously published techniques ( 47 ) . In brief , luciferin - luciferase stock solution was prepared from one vial of ATP assay solution ( Sigma ) plus 450 (cid:3) l of isotonic buffer ( 105 mM NaCl , 5 mM KCl , 10 mM HEPES , 5 mM NaHCO 3 , 60 mM mannitol , 5 mM glucose , 0 . 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 . 3 mM CaCl 2 , pH 7 . 4 ) plus 50 (cid:3) l of distilled water . This stock solution was further diluted 25 - fold in Earle’s MEM to make a working luciferin - luciferase assay solution . Twenty - ﬁve microliters of each medium sample were placed into a well of an opaque white 96 - well plate and diluted with an equal volume of luciferin - luciferase assay solution . Light emitted from luciferase luminescence , which is proportional to the concentration of ATP in the solution , was recorded with a Luminoskan Ascent micro - plate luminometer ( Labsystems , Franklin , MA ) . Luminescence mea - surements were taken every minute for 15 min with an integration time of 100 ms / well . The ATP content in each sample was calculated as the mean signal obtained in the ﬁrst 5 min of measurements calibrated to a standard curve . Statistics . Data are presented as means (cid:6) SE . Least squares analysis was calculated with Microsoft Excel , and statistical signiﬁ - cance was calculated with SigmaStat ( Jandel Scientiﬁc ) using either a standard t - test or paired t - test as noted in the ﬁgure legends . For comparisons , P values (cid:10) 0 . 05 were considered to reﬂect statistically signiﬁcant differences . L490 PARACRINE STIMULATION OF SURFACTANT SECRETION BY ATP AJP - Lung Cell Mol Physiol • VOL 289 • SEPTEMBER 2005 • www . ajplung . org on M a y 6 , 2010 a j p l ung . ph ys i o l og y . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m RESULTS We used a model based on two preparations of isolated rat alveolar epithelial cells as a method to mimic interactions that occur between alveolar epithelial cells . To distinguish between the two different cell types in coculture , CellTracker CMFDA was used as a vital ﬂuorescent stain to label a subpopulation of alveolar epithelial cells . As shown in Fig . 1 , CMFDA incor - poration by ATII cells was a linear function of cell number . CMFDA remained associated with ATII cells after overnight incubation and did not transfer to unlabeled ATI cells . By phase - contrast microscopy , CMFDA - labeled cells showed la - mellar bodies suggesting they have the capacity to secrete surfactant lipid . Also , cocultures contained 1 . 2 (cid:6) 0 . 4 ( n (cid:5) 8 ) ATII cells for each ATI cell , slightly less than the 2 : 1 ratio typically found in the adult lung ( 18 ) . Surfactant lipids in ATII cells can be metabolically labeled using [ 3 H ] choline to produce [ 3 H ] PC . With the use of this approach , it was found that extracellular ATP stimulates iso - lated ATII cells to secrete [ 3 H ] PC ( 5 , 28 ) . We conﬁrmed that metabolically labeled ATII cells incubated for 2 h with 1 mM ATP were stimulated to secrete [ 3 H ] PC compared with un - stimulated controls ( Fig . 2 A ) . In contrast , ATI cells secreted little , if any , [ 3 H ] PC in response to extracellular ATP , consis - tent with a previous report ( 53 ) . This also suggests that in cocultures , any [ 3 H ] PC secreted would be due to ATII cells rather than ATI cells . Metabolically labeled lipid provides a direct measure of surfactant secretion . This method works well for isolated ATII cells , since the amount of secreted lipid can be normalized to the total lipid pool as a way to control for the number of ATII cells per dish . However , when ATII cells are combined with ATI cells , [ 3 H ] choline is incorporated into the intracellular PC pools of both ATII and ATI cells . Thus to compare the amount of surfactant lipid secreted by ATII cells alone to the amount of secretion by ATII cells cocultured with ATI cells , we normalized the amount of [ 3 H ] PC secreted to the number of ATII cells using CMFDA ﬂuorescence ( [ 3 H ] PC secreted / ATII cell ) . CMFDA incorporation by ATII cells was linear with respect to ATII cell number , and ATI cells were not ﬂuores - cent . Using this approach , we found that ATII cells were stimulated to secrete comparable amounts of [ 3 H ] PC in re - sponse to 1 mM ATP regardless of whether they were alone or combined with ATI cells ( Fig . 2 B ) . Thus ATI cells did not alter the ability of ATII cells to secrete surfactant lipid in response to extracellular ATP . To assess the effect of stretch on alveolar epithelial cells , we used a previously described cell deformation apparatus ( 55 ) . Cells were plated onto a ﬁbronectin - coated silastic substratum in a well mounted into a holder / indentor ( Fig . 3 A ) . Cells were stretched by rotating the well a deﬁned number of turns , which caused the indentor to push up on the substratum . This in turn stretched the substratum , creating an equibiaxial deformation ( 55 ) . Microscopy and morphometric analysis were used to measure changes in cell surface area as a function of the number of turns for ATI and ATII cells in coculture . Both ATI and ATII cells had comparable changes in cell size as a function of number of turns . Thus the ATII cells were ﬁrmly Fig . 1 . Vital cell staining of alveolar epithelial cells is shown . A : alveolar type II ( ATII ) cells were isolated and labeled with the ﬂuorescent vital dye 5 - chloromethylﬂuorescein diacetate ( CMFDA ) during the biopanning step of the isolation procedure , seeded to different densities , and cultured overnight in a 24 - well dish . Cell - associated ﬂuorescence was measured using a PE Biosys - tems ﬂuorescence microplate reader . Data points represent the means of triplicate wells , and SD was less than data point symbol size . By least squares analysis , cell - associated CMFDA relative ﬂuorescence units ( RFU ) were linearly related to ATII cell number . B – G : cultures containing only CMFDA - labeled ATII cells ( B and E ) , a mixture of ATII and alveolar type I - like ( ATI ) cells ( C and F ) , or ATI cells alone ( D and G ) were visualized by phase - contrast microscopy ( B – D ) and labeled ATII cells by CMDFA ﬂuorescence ( E – G ) .

ATP - stimulated phospholipid secretion by ATII cells was comparable for monocultures and cocultures . A : cells were metabolically labeled overnight with [ 3 H ] choline , washed , and then treated with 1 mM ATP for 2 h at 37°C to stimulate [ 3 H ] phosphatidylcholine ( [ 3 H ] PC ) secretion . Shown is the mean percentage (cid:6) SE of total [ 3 H ] PC secreted into the medium by unstimulated [ control ( con ) , gray bars ] or ATP - stimulated ( black bars ) cells . Monocultures of ATII cells showed signiﬁcant [ 3 H ] PC secretion in response to ATP com - pared with untreated controls ; however , ATI cells were not responsive to ATP . B : CMFDA - labeled ATII cells alone or cocultured with ATI cells were metabolically labeled overnight and stimulated with ATP as above . The amount of [ 3 H ] PC secreted into the medium by unstimulated ( con , gray bars ) or ATP - stimulated cells ( black bars ) was normalized to CMFDA ﬂuorescence ( [ 3 H ] PC secreted / ATII cells ) as described in METHODS . Data were calculated from 3 independent determinations ; * signiﬁcantly different from unstimulated controls ( P (cid:10) 0 . 05 ) .

Wirtz and Dobbs ( 59 ) previously found that metabolically labeled ATII cells secrete [ 3 H ] PC in response to mechanical deformation . As shown in Fig . 4 , we conﬁrmed that ATII cells mechanically stretched to 25 % were stimulated to secrete [ 3 H ] PC . However , ATI cells did not secrete [ 3 H ] PC in re - sponse to stretch . As was the case for ATP - stimulated [ 3 H ] PC secretion , this suggests that any [ 3 H ] PC secreted into the medium by cocultures in response to mechanical stimulation would be from ATII cells , not ATI cells . [ 3 H ] PC secretion by ATII cells alone or cocultured with ATI cells was determined as a function of increasing levels of mechanical deformation ( Fig . 5 ) . For these experiments , the level of [ 3 H ] PC secreted / ATII cell RFU was calculated so that unstretched controls were set to a value of 0 . For each magni - tude of stretch tested , cells were stimulated to secrete more [ 3 H ] PC than unstretched controls . At 12 % stretch , ATII cells secreted comparable levels of [ 3 H ] PC regardless of whether or not ATI cells were present . However , at 21 % stretch , there was a difference in the level of surfactant lipid secretion . ATII cells cocultured with ATI cells secreted roughly two - to threefold more [ 3 H ] PC than ATII cells alone . Thus coculture with ATI cells enhanced the ability of the ATII cells to respond to 21 % stretch . At 30 % stretch , ATII cells cocultured with ATI cells maintained this higher level of [ 3 H ] PC secretion . ATII cells alone also showed a higher level of [ 3 H ] PC secretion at 30 % compared with lesser stretch magnitudes . This is consistent with a ﬂuorescence microscopy study that showed that ATII cells had signiﬁcantly more lamellar body - plasma membrane fusion at 30 – 50 % stretch as opposed to 10 – 20 % stretch where few lamellar body fusion events were detected ( 26 ) . Thus the amount of [ 3 H ] PC secreted in response to mechanical defor - mation was a function of both cell population and the magni - tude of stretch . In particular , the enhanced amount of [ 3 H ] PC secreted by ATII cells cocultured with ATI cells at 21 % stretch indicated that there was likely to be signaling from ATI cells to ATII cells .

Shown is mean cell area (cid:6) SE calculated morphometrically as a function of the number of turns of the well in the indentor housing . Data are from 5 independent wells , measuring 5 – 8 cells of each type per well . Both ATII cells ( F ) and ATI cells ( ■ ) increased in size with increasing number of turns . Fig . 4 . ATI cells do not secrete PC in response to mechanical deformation . ATII cells alone or ATI cells alone were labeled overnight with [ 3 H ] choline , washed , tonically stretched to 25 % for 15 min , released , and then further incubated for 2 h at37°C . Shown is the mean percentage (cid:6) SE of total [ 3 H ] PC secreted into the medium by unstimulated ( con , gray bars ) or stretched ( black bars ) cells .

Neither treatment had a signiﬁcant effect on surfactant lipid secretion at 21 % stretch . Cocultures pretreated and stretched in the presence of GAP inhibitor peptides secreted 96 . 9 (cid:6) 0 . 7 % of the level of [ 3 H ] PC secreted by untreated control cocultures . Also , cocultures pre - treated and stretched in the presence of 40 (cid:3) M (cid:8) - glycyrrhetinic acid secreted 107 . 6 (cid:6) 2 . 4 % of the level of [ 3 H ] PC secreted by untreated control cocultures . Thus we were unable to detect a role for gap junctional communication in the control of sur - factant secretion in this experimental system . Despite the lack of an affect on [ 3 H ] PC secretion , (cid:8) - glycyrrhetinic acid inhib - ited gap junctional communication between ATI cells by 95 % , whereas control cells showed extensive transfer of microin - jected Alexa Fluor 488 [ 16 . 5 (cid:6) 2 . 3 labeled cells / injection ( n (cid:5) 12 ) ] vs . (cid:8) - glycyrrhetinic acid - treated cells [ 0 . 8 (cid:6) 0 . 8 labeled cells / injection ( n (cid:5) 7 ) ] . Qualitatively , (cid:8) - glycyrrhetinic acid also inhibited gap junctional communication between ATI and ATII cells , as measured using the preloading assay . Although gap junction inhibitors did not inhibit stretch - induced [ 3 H ] PC secretion , it is important to note that , even in coculture with ATI cells , ATII cells are also directly stretched , which was likely to inﬂuence their response ( see DISCUSSION ) . To determine whether extracellular ATP release contributed to the increased sensitivity of cocultures to mechanical stimu - lation , ATII cells alone or cocultured with ATI cells were pretreated with a combination of apyrase and ADA to com - pletely metabolize any extracellular ATP released by cells in response to mechanical deformation . Although the main end product of apyrase is AMP , ADA was included to degrade any potential adenosine generated by AMP hydrolysis , since aden - osine is known to stimulate surfactant secretion ( 29 , 32 ) . In each case , cells were ﬁrst pretreated with ATPases and then mechanically stimulated in the presence of the enzymes . At 21 % stretch , ATPases had little effect on ATII cells alone ( Fig . 5 B ) . In contrast , at 21 % stretch , ATPases signiﬁcantly inhib - ited [ 3 H ] PC secretion by ATII cells cocultured with ATI cells . At 30 % stretch , ATPases inhibited surfactant secretion by ATII cells regardless of whether they were alone or cocultured with ATI cells . Thus , at high levels of mechanical deformation , there was a component of [ 3 H ] PC secretion due to extracellular ATP release , regardless of whether ATI cells were present . This was further conﬁrmed to be due to extracellular ATP release , since apyrase alone inhibited stretch - induced [ 3 H ] PC secretion by ATII cells [ 73 (cid:6) 24 % inhibition ( n (cid:5) 2 ) ] and cocultures [ 60 (cid:6) 13 % ( n (cid:5) 2 ) ] to levels comparable to cells treated with both apyrase and ADA ( Fig . 5 ) . To directly measure ATP release by mechanically stimulated cells , we used a luciferase assay to measure ATP secreted into the medium by either ATI or ATII cells . Note that our mea - surements of ATP release were taken using cells treated with ARL - 67156 to inhibit degradation of extracellular ATP by ecto - ATPases ( 17 , 38 ) . As shown in Fig . 6 , ATI cells showed signiﬁcantly more ATP release at 21 % stretch than ATII cells . At 30 % stretch , both ATI and ATII cells released ATP . Comparable results were obtained at 5 and 10 min following stretch , suggesting that stretch - induced ATP release had reached a plateau value . For instance , medium collected from ATI cells 5 and 10 min after initiating 21 % stretch contained 23 . 6 (cid:6) 12 . 8 nM ATP and 22 . 0 (cid:6) 3 . 6 nM ATP , respectively ( n (cid:5) 4 ) . These results were consistent with the results in Fig . 5 and suggest that ATP release by ATI cells plays a role in mechanically stimulated surfactant secretion by ATII cells . DISCUSSION In response to mechanical deformation , ATII cells secrete pulmonary surfactant ( 59 ) . We found that at 21 % stretch , surfactant lipid secretion by ATII cells was stimulated by paracrine ATP release by ATI cells . At higher levels of stretch , ATII cells also showed an autocrine ATP stimulated surfactant secretion pathway . This suggests that mechanically stimulated extracellular ATP release might be a normal function of type I cells to provide a pathway for mechanically stimulated surfac - tant release at modest levels of stretch . Consistent with the notion of a speciﬁc ATP release pathway for alveolar epithelial cells , other types of epithelial cells have been shown to mediate physiological secretion of ATP in response to mechanical or osmotic stress ( 8 , 51 ) . There are several distinct mechanisms that have been implicated in ATP Fig . 6 . ATI cells release ATP at a lower mechanical threshold than ATII cells . A : representative luminometric traces showing medium ATP concentration for ATII cells ( top ) or ATI cells ( bottom ) . Gray lines denote readings from medium harvested before stretch ( (cid:9) ) ; black lines denote medium harvested after 10 min of stretch at either 12 , 21 , or 30 % increase in cell area ( (cid:7) ) . Readings collected during the ﬁrst 5 min of collecting luminescence data were averaged to provide a measure of luminescence from each individual sample . B : luminescence measurements were calibrated to an ATP standard curve . Bars represent means (cid:6) SE for n (cid:5) 3 – 4 independent determinations for ATII cells ( gray bars ) or ATI cells ( black bars ) following 10 min of stretch at 12 , 21 , or 30 % increase in cell area . ATP release by ATI cells was signiﬁcantly greater than unstretched controls for 21 and 31 % stretch and by ATII cells for 30 % stretch ( * P (cid:10) 0 . 05 ) . ATI cells also were signiﬁcantly more sensitive than ATII cells to release ATP at 21 % stretch ( † P (cid:10) 0 . 05 ) .

Many of these channels are present in alveolar epithelial cells , including CFTR ( 14 ) and P - glycoprotein ( 15 ) . Although the mechanisms mediating mechanically induced ATP release by alveolar epithelial cells remain to be deter - mined , we can rule out the possibility of ATP permeability through plasma membrane gap junction hemichannels ( 4 , 16 , 52 ) , since gap junction inhibitors had little effect on enhanced surfactant lipid secretion by cocultures subjected to 21 % stretch . Differences in mechanical sensitivity were not likely to be due to a difference in cell adhesion , since ATI and ATII cells were well attached to the membrane whether or not they were in monocultures or cocultures , and their deformation was indistinguishable from the membrane substrate ( Fig . 3 and Ref . 54 ) . One possibility is that a difference in mechanical sensi - tivity was due to the greater surface area for ATI cells com - pared with ATII cells , a trait ATI cells have in common with type I cells in situ . ATI cells have a large , ﬂat surface in contact with the substratum with the potential to have a higher capacity to transduce changes in substratum surface area than the more cuboidal ATII cells . Also , ATI and ATII cells have differences in cytoskeletal organization as determined using beads coated with Arg - Gly - Asp ( RGD ) peptides ( RGD beads ) that bind to integrins at the cell surface and magnetic twisting cytometry to measure the extent of integrin association with the cytoskeleton ( 7 ) . Berrios et al . ( 7 ) showed that RGD beads bound to ATI cells had twice the resistance to rotation than RGD beads bound to ATII cells . This suggests that integrins expressed by ATI were more tightly associated with the cytoskeleton than ATII cell integrins . Because integrin - cytoskeletal interactions are a critical component of stretch - induced signal transduction ( 34 ) , a more stable integrin - cytoskeleton complex for ATI cells compared with ATII cells is consistent with the notion that ATI cells were more efﬁcient at transducing mechanical signals than ATII cells . Critically , we can rule out plasma membrane rupture as a mechanism for ATP release by ATI cells . Tschumperlin and colleagues ( 55 , 56 ) have shown that ATI cells are remarkably resistant to stretch - induced injury compared with ATII cells , even at extreme levels of stretch beyond the magnitudes tested here . As previously determined ( 55 ) , 21 % tonic stretch causes plasma membrane rupture in roughly 13 % of ATII cells and (cid:10) 1 % of ATI cells . However , at the same stretch magnitude , ATI cells secreted approximately ﬁvefold more ATP than ATII cells ( Fig . 6 ) . Thus ATI cells were less susceptible to damage than ATII cells yet secreted more ATP . ATI cell damage is also extremely low at 30 % stretch ( 55 ) . Whether ATII cell damage plays a role in ATP release at 30 % stretch where roughly 30 % of ATII cells are damaged remains to be determined . However , we can rule out cell damage as a source for enhanced [ 3 H ] PC secretion by ATII cells in general since it was inhibited by apyrase treatment at all stretch magnitudes examined . Gap junction inhibitors had no effect on [ 3 H ] PC secretion by ATII cells regardless of whether or not they were combined with ATI cells . We were surprised by this observation since these agents inhibited transmission of mechanically induced calcium transients from ATI to ATII cells by cultured cells ( 9 , 35 , 36 ) . Also , Ashino et al . ( 3 ) showed using in situ whole lung microscopy that hyperinﬂation initiated a transient increase in type I cell cytosolic calcium that was transmitted to type II cells through gap junctions and was required to initiate lamellar body fusion with the plasma membrane . In that study , hyper - inﬂation did not directly stretch type II cells , which under - scores the physiological relevance of type I cell mechanical stimulation as a pathway to stimulate surfactant secretion . We found that ATII cells were subjected to direct mechanical stimulation in our system . Direct stimulation of ATII cells stimulates lipid insertion into the plasma membrane ( 25 , 57 ) and surfactant release ( 59 ) . Cell stretch also causes the direct inﬂux of extracellular calcium , through either plasma mem - brane disruption or activation of channels ( 26 , 46 ) . Thus , in our coculture system , recruitment of calcium or inositol 1 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate from ATI cells via gap junctions was not likely to be required to initiate a calcium signaling pathway in ATII cells since this pathway would be directly stimulated by ATII cell stretch . We found that ATI cells released ATP in response to stretch at a concentration sufﬁcient to induce surfactant lipid secretion by ATII cells . However , Isakson et al . ( 35 , 36 ) found that mechanical stimulation of an individual ATI cell with a glass micropipette did not induce a detectable level of extracellular ATP release . Thus , on a per cell basis , ATP release by mechanically stimulated ATI cells is likely to be low . How - ever , when we stimulated the entire monolayer , the net release of ATP was signiﬁcant ( Fig . 6 ) . Although the net level of ATP released into the medium is apparently low ( (cid:11) 10 – 50 nM ) , ATP concentrations near the cell surface are typically orders of magnitude higher than bulk measurements of ATP released into the medium ( 6 ) . It also has been suggested that ATP release sites and receptors may be compartmentalized into membrane microdomains to enable high local ATP concentra - tions ( 38 ) . These two factors are likely to bring the local extracellular ATP concentration into the micromolar range required to stimulate surfactant lipid secretion ( 30 ) . In contrast to ATI cells , Isakson et al . ( 35 , 36 ) found that micropipette stimulation of ATII cells induced extracellular ATP release . Because we also observed ATP release by ATII cells at high levels of stretch , this suggests that micropipette stimulation of small , cuboidal ATII cells may create focal distortions equivalent to signiﬁcant changes in cell surface area . However , the same focal membrane deformation of large , ﬂat ATI cells results in a smaller change in surface area , suggesting a rationale for the ability of the micropipette method to be more effective at stimulating ATII cells com - pared with ATI cells . In summary , we found that ATI cells release extracellular ATP at a lower threshold of stretch than ATII cells and that this can serve as a paracrine pathway to stimulate surfactant secre - tion . Because there are many other cell types in the lung , such as ﬁbroblasts , it is certainly possible that other cells could be sources of extracellular ATP . However , A549 lung epithelial cells release 12 - fold more ATP in response to mechanical stimulation than NIH / 3T3 ﬁbroblasts ( 13 ) , suggesting that the epithelium in the lung is likely the major source of extracellular ATP released in response to stretch . For alveolar epithelial cells cultured on a deformable silastic substratum , 21 % stretch corresponds to 60 – 80 % total lung capacity ( 54 ) . This level of L494 PARACRINE STIMULATION OF SURFACTANT SECRETION BY ATP AJP - Lung Cell Mol Physiol • VOL 289 • SEPTEMBER 2005 • www . ajplung . org on M a y 6 , 2010 a j p l ung . ph ys i o l og y . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m mechanical distension is in the physiological range of a deep breath , yawn , or sigh ( 21 , 42 ) . Also , in the injured lung , there are likely to be hot spots where alveoli are inﬂated to a comparable level to compensate for atelectasis of neighboring alveoli ( 50 ) . Although type I cells are more likely to be subjected to greater relative changes in cell size than type II cells in the intact lung ( 3 ) , type I cell stretch might not be required in vivo since alveolar unfolding might also stimulate type I cells to secrete ATP by subjecting the cells to shear forces . Regardless of the mechanism , our results are consistent with a role for type I cells as mechanosensors in the lung and underscore the notion that type II and type I alveolar epithelial cells act in concert to regulate pulmonary surfactant secretion .
