Siminovitch † INTRODUCTION : The essential role of actin cyto - skeletal regulatory proteins in expression of effective immune responses is exemplified by the impaired immunity manifested by patients deficient for the Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome actin modulatory protein ( WASp ) . Among other WASp - related drivers of actin rearrange - ment , the WASp family verprolin homologous protein 2 ( WAVE2 ) is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells and has been implicated in the cytoskeletal remodeling required for T cell adhesion and organization of the immu - nological synapse . However , the precise roles of WAVE2 in modulating T cell functions that govern immunity remain unknown . RATIONALE : WAVE2 stability and subcellular localization depend on its constitutive associ - ation with the ABI1 / 2 ( Abelson interactor 1 / 2 ) , HEM1 ( hematopoietic protein 1 ) , HSPC300 ( haematopoietic stem / progenitor cell protein 300 ) , and CYFIP1 ( cytoplasmic FMR1 interact - ing protein 1 ) proteins , which together consti - tute a pentameric WAVE regulatory complex ( WRC ) that supports WAVE2 activation by the Rac guanosine triphosphatase and other stimulatorysignals thattrigger WAVE2 - driven actin - related protein - 2 / 3 ( Arp2 / 3 ) – dependent actin nucleation . Genetic data implicating sev - eral WAVE2 - associated WRC proteins in auto - immunediseaseandtheestablishedlink between cytoskeletal regulator dysfunction and immune deficiency raise the possibility that WAVE2 represents an important effector of T cell contri - butionstoimmunecompetence . Thus , wederived WAVE2 T cell conditional knockout ( Wave2 cKO ) mice to enable investigation of WAVE2 influence on T cell homeostasis and function . RESULTS : Characterization of Wave2 cKO mice expressing WAVE2 - deficient T cells revealed numbers of peripheral T cells to be reduced in young ( < 4 weeks old ) mice but progres - sively increased and surpassed those of con - trolmicebyage8weeks . AlthoughthymicTcell development appeared normal , Wave2 cKO mice manifested progressive severe autoimmune and inflammatory disease characterized by splenomegaly , lymphadenopathy , multiorgan lymphocyte infiltration , and early death . Sig - nificant increases in proinflammatory cyto - kine and autoantibody expression were also detected in these mice and were accompa - nied by spontaneous activation and accel - erated differentiation of peripheral T cells . Wave2 cKO mice also exhibited markedly im - paired antigen - specific immune responses associated with exhausted T cells , showing increases in T cell inhibitory receptor expres - sion , dysregulated mitochondrial function , and increased activation - induced cell death . T cell antigen receptor ( TCR ) – driven actin polymerization and chemotaxis were also im - paired in WAVE2 - deficient T cells , with aber - rant trafficking of these cells to nonlymphoid organs . WAVE2 deficiency had negligible ef - fects on proximal TCR signaling but was asso - ciated with significantly increased activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR ) in response to antigen receptor or cytokine stimulation . Mechanistically , WAVE2 bound mTOR and constrained mTOR binding to RAPTOR ( regulatory - associated protein of mTOR ) and RICTOR ( rapamycin - insensitive companion of mTOR ) , key components of the mTOR complexes 1 and 2 , respectively . Con - sistent with WAVE2 ’ s suppressive effect on mTOR activation , pharmacologic inhibition ofmTORameliorated theTcell anomalies and the immunodysregulatory phenotypes man - ifested in Wave2 cKO mice .

Siminovitch 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 6 † Cytoskeletal regulatory protein dysfunction has been etiologically linked to inherited diseases associated with immunodeficiency and autoimmunity , but the mechanisms involved are incompletely understood . Here , we show that conditional Wave2 ablation in T cells causes severe autoimmunity associated with increased mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR ) activation and metabolic reprogramming that engender spontaneous activation and accelerated differentiation of peripheral T cells . These mice also manifest diminished antigen - specific T cell responses associated with increased inhibitory receptor expression , dysregulated mitochondrial function , and reduced cell survival upon activation . Mechanistically , WAVE2 directly bound mTOR and inhibited its activation by impeding mTOR interactions with RAPTOR ( regulatory - associated protein of mTOR ) and RICTOR ( rapamycin - insensitive companion of mTOR ) . Both the T cell defects and immunodysregulatory disease were ameliorated by pharmacological mTOR inhibitors . Thus , WAVE2 restraint of mTOR activation is an absolute requirement for maintaining the T cell homeostasis supporting adaptive immune responses and preventing autoimmunity . W iskott – Aldrich immune deficiency syndrome ( WAS ) is caused by the dysfunction or deficiency of an actin cytoskeletalregulatoryprotein , WASp , highlighting the critical contribution of actin dynamics to immune cellular re - sponses . The WASp - related family of proteins use a C - terminal verprolin homology – central – acidic ( VCA ) domain to bind and activate the actin - nucleating actin - related protein - 2 / 3 ( Arp2 / 3 ) complex ( 1 , 2 ) . Within this family are three WASp family verprolin homologous proteins ( WAVE1 - 3 ) that are distinguished from other family members by their consti - tutive association with ABI1 ( Abelson inter - actor1 ) / ABI2 , HEM1 ( hematopoieticprotein1 ) / HEM2 / NCKAP1L , HSPC300 ( haematopoietic stem / progenitor cell protein 300 ) , and CYFIP1 ( cytoplasmicFMR1interactingprotein1 ) within a WAVE regulatory complex ( WRC ) . These in - teractions are key to WAVE stability and to its inducibleassociationwith activated Rac , phos - phorylation , and other intra - and intermolecu - lar modifications that promote WAVE2 - driven Arp2 / 3 activation ( 3 , 4 ) . Among the WAVE proteins , only WAVE2 is predominantly ex - pressed in hemopoietic cells . WAVE2 plays a roleinTcellantigenreceptor ( TCR ) – stimulated integrin clustering and in the actin remodel - ing required for immunologic synapse forma - tion ( 5 ) . Recent association data implicating variants in the ABI1 / 2 , HEM1 , and ARP2 / 3 gene loci in autoimmune disease raise the possibility that WAVE2 roles in T cells may also be relevant to the immune dysfunction underpinning such conditions ( 6 , 7 ) . However , the extent to which WAVE2 modulates T cell contributions to immunity and the mecha - nisms by which it subserves such roles remains largely unknown . WAVE2 deficiency is associated with enhanced T cell activation and autoimmunity Because germline ablation of Wave2 in mice leads to embryonic death ( 8 ) , WAVE2 contri - butions to T cell functions were investigated by breeding mice carrying a germline loxP - flanked Wave2 gene with mice expressing Cd4 - promoter – driven Cre recombinase ( fig . S1 , A and B ) . Immunoblotting analysis confirmed that WAVE2 protein expression was undetect - able in CD4 + CD8 + double - positive ( DP ) and CD4 + and CD8 + single - positive ( SP ) thymocytes and peripheral T cells in the Wave2 T cell con - ditional knockout ( Wave2 cKO ) mice ( fig . S1 , C and D ) . By contrast , WAVE2 was normally expressed in other immune cell lineages . Com - pared with control ( Wave2 fl / fl ) mice , Wave2 cKO mice displayed normal thymic cellularity , with minor increases in frequencies and numbers of CD4 + and CD8 + SP thymocytes ( fig . S2 , A to C ) . The expression of developmental mark - ers such as TCR b , CD3 , CD5 , CD25 , and CD44 ( fig . S2D ) and proportions of CD69 hi CD5 hi cells , which primarily represent positively se - lected TCR ab SP thymocytes , were normal in the Wave2 cKO mice ( fig . S2E ) . Furthermore , positive and negative selection of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells were comparable in Wave2 cKO and control mice carrying either OT - II or H - Y TCR transgenes ( fig . S2 , F and G ) . Thus , WAVE2 is not required for intrathymic T cell selection and development . Despite near - normal T cell development , Wave2 cKO mice manifested early onset inflam - matory autoimmune disease , which is char - acterized by progressive enlargement of the spleen and peripheral lymph nodes ; extensive T cell infiltration in the liver , lung , kidney , and other organs by age 8 weeks ; and early death ( Fig . 1 , A to C , and fig . S3 , A to C ) . Immuno - globulin G ( IgG ) immune complex deposi - tion in the kidney was also observed in about 20 % of these mice ( fig . S3 , D and E ) . The frequencies and absolute numbers of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells in the spleen and lymph nodes were significantly decreased in young Wave2 cKO compared with control mice ( Fig . 1 , D and E ) , but numbers of T cells progressively increased in the Wave2 cKO mice , significantly surpassing thoseofcontrol micebyage8 weeks ( Fig . 1E ) . The frequency of CD44 hi CD62L lo ef - fectormemoryTcellswasparticularlyincreasedinthe Wave2 cKO mice , with CD44 lo CD62L hi naïve T cell frequency concomitantly decreased in both lymph nodes and spleen ( Fig . 1F ) . Con - sistent with an activated phenotype , Ki - 67 + T cell numbers were increased in the lymph nodes of Wave2 cKO mice ( Fig . 1G ) , and ex vivo stimulation of CD4 + T cells purified from Wave2 cKO lymph nodes elicited aberrantly in - creased expression of proinflammatory cyto - kinessuchasinterferon - g ( IFN - g ) , interleukin - 2 ( IL - 2 ) , IL - 4 , IL - 17a , and tumor necrosis factor – a ( TNF - a ) ( Fig . 1H ) . CD8 + T cells from these mice also expressed increased amounts of IFN - g , IL - 2 , granzyme B , and TNF - a compared with control cells ( Fig . 1I ) . Expansion of B cell , den - dritic cell , and myeloid cell populations was observed in the Wave2 cKO mice ( fig . S3F ) together with elevated levels of serum IgG1 and IgE antibodies as well as antinuclear , anti – double - strandedDNA , and anti – Sjögren ’ s syndrome – related antigen A autoantibodies ( Fig . 1 , J and K ) . Thus , the selective deficiency of WAVE2 in T cells is associated with their aberrant activation in the periphery , with likely bystander effects on other immune cell pop - ulations and consequent inflammation and autoimmunity .

Moreover , when adoptively transferred into Rag2 - deficient ( fig . S5 , D and E ) or C57BL / 6 ( fig .

The hyperproliferative phenotype of adoptively transferred Wave2 cKO T cells was dramatically reduced by treating C57BL / 6 re - cipient mice with antibodies against major histocompatibility complex II ( MHC - II ) or the IL - 7 receptor or by transferring these cells into MHC - II – deficient mice ( fig .

Comparedwithcontrolcells , WAVE2 - deficient CD4 + T cells expressed significantly higher levels of T - bet and GATA - binding protein 3 ( GATA3 ) , in response to ex vivo stimulation ( Fig . 2C ) . Moreover , under T helper 1 ( T H 1 ) or T H 2 cell – polarizing conditions , Wave2 cKO CD4 + T cells expressed abnormally high levels of IFN - g , IL - 4 , T - bet , and GATA3 ( Fig . 2 , D and E ) . The KLRG1 hi CD127 lo terminal effector CD8 + T cell population also expanded in Wave2 cKO mice compared with control counterparts ( fig . S5 , H and I ) . Thus , WAVE2 deficiency is associated with skewed differentiation of T H 1 and T H 2 CD4 + T cells and an acceleration of terminal differentiation of CD8 + T cells . To test whether the T cell defects imbued byWAVE2deficiencywerecellintrinsic , mixed bone marrow ( BM ) chimeric mice were de - rived by adoptively transferring equal ratios of CD45 . 1 + wild - type BM cells and CD45 . 2 + Wave2 cKO BM cells into irradiated Rag2 − / − mice . In contrast to control mice reconsti - tuted with only wild - type BM , the mixed BM chimeras developed a lymphoproliferative phenotype similar to but milder than the phe - notype of Wave2 cKO mice . The frequencies of CD44 hi CD62 lo and BrdU + post - pulse – labeled T cells were higher , and expression of IFN - g and IL - 4 as well as T - bet / GATA3 was also increased in the WAVE2 - deficient T cells com - pared with wild - type BM - derived CD4 + T cells ( Fig . 2 , F to I ) . The T cell – intrinsic effects of WAVE2 deficiency were further tested in mice derived by crossing Wave2 fl / fl with Cd4 Cre ER T2 mice so as to enable tamoxifen - induced dele - tion of WAVE2 in peripheral CD4 + T cells ( 11 ) . Tamoxifen treatment resulted in a peripheral CD4 + T cell population lacking WAVE2 and exhibiting more rapid cycling and increased expression of CD44 , Ki - 67 , IFN - g , IL - 4 , T - bet , and GATA3 relative to cells from similarly treated control mice ( Fig . 2 , J to N ) . Thus , WAVE2 plays an essential , cell - intrinsic role in restraining T cell activation and effector dif - ferentiation so as to maintain T cell quiescence and homeostasis . Because WAVE2 regulates actin remodeling ( 12 , 13 ) , the extent to which impaired actin cytoskeletal dynamics contributes to the dis - ruption of T cell homeostasis in Wave2 cKO mice was also explored . TCR - and cytokine - induced actin polymerization ( fig . S6 , A and B ) , in vivo cell displacement and migration speed ( fig . S6 , C and D ) , and in vitro chemo - taxic responses ( fig . S6E ) were decreased in WAVE2 - deficient T cells . Export of fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) – labeled thymocytes to the periphery was comparable in Wave2 cKO and control mice ( fig . S6F ) . However , when adoptively transferred into C57BL / 6 mice , the Wave2 cKO T cells showed reduced ability to hometolymphoidorgansbutmanifestedmark - edly increased trafficking to the liver , lung , and other nonlymphoid organs ( fig . S6G ) . Con - sistently , expression of CXCR3 , a chemokine receptor critical for T cell trafficking to non - lymphoid organs ( 14 ) , was relatively high ( fig . S6 , H and I ) , and expression of CD62L , a re - ceptor that supports T cell localization in sec - ondary lymphoid organs ( 15 ) , was relatively low ( Fig . 1F ) in Wave2 cKO compared with con - trol T cells . WAVE2 is therefore dispensable for T cell egress from the thymus but plays a substantial role in regulating the homing and migration of mature T cells . WAVE2 ablation results in aberrant AKT - mTOR activation and metabolic reprogramming To delineatethemechanisms bywhich WAVE2 affects T cell homeostasis , we next investigated the effects of WAVE2 deficiency on signaling pathways integral to T cell activation . Although WAVE2istransientlyrecruitedtotheTCRafterTCRengagement ( 5 ) , LCK , ZAP70 , and PLC - g phosphorylation as well as intracellular Ca 2 + influx induced by antibodies to CD3 / CD28 or ovalbumin peptide 323 - 339 ( OVA 323 - 339 ) – pulsed antigen presenting cells ( APCs ) were all comparablein Wave2 cKO and control T cells ( fig . S7 , A to C ) . Because the mTORsignaling cascade plays a central role in the regulation of T cell activa - tion and homeostasis ( 16 , 17 ) , we explored the possibility that WAVE2 deficiency affects mTORactivity . PhosphorylationofthemTORC1 targets S6K , S6 ( Ser 240 / 244 ) , and 4E - BP1 and the mTORC2 target AKT ( Ser 473 ) was dramatically increased in both anti - CD3 / CD28 – stimulated ( Fig . 3 , A and B ) and OVA 323 - 339 peptide – stimulated ( fig . S8A ) Wave2 cKO T cells relative to control T cells . Stimulation with g - chain cytokines such as IL - 2 and IL - 7 , which are critical regulators of T cell homeostasis , also elicited markedly greater phosphorylation of S6 ( Ser 240 / 244 ) and AKT ( Ser 473 ) in WAVE2 cKO relative to control T cells ( Fig . 3 , C and D ) . However , phosphoinositide 3 kinase ( PI3K ) activation was not significantly affected in T cells by WAVE2 deficiency ( fig . S8B ) , sug - gesting that WAVE2 effects on mTOR are pri - marily realized by molecular interactions occurring downstream of membrane proxi - mal stimulatory signals . Consistent with these findings , the hyperactivation of AKT - mTOR signaling observed in Wave2 cKO T cells af - ter anti - CD3 / CD28 ( Fig . 3E and fig . S8C ) or OVA 323 - 339 peptide ( fig . S8D ) stimulation was significantly reduced by treatment with the mTORC1 / mTORC2 inhibitor Torin 2 ( 18 ) . Overexpression of WAVE2 in Jurkat cells also resulted in marked reduction of anti - CD3 / CD28 – induced AKT - mTOR activation ( fig . S8E ) . Thus , WAVE2 plays an essential role in restraining mTOR activation in response to tonic and stimulatory activating signals . Given the critical roles for mTOR in regulat - ing the metabolic reprogramming required for T cell activation and differentiation ( 17 , 19 ) , we examined the effects of WAVE2 deficiency on selected outputs of T cell metabolic pathways . In line with increased mTOR activity , cell size , basal aerobic glycolysis , and glucose uptake as well as oxygen consumption rates were signif - icantly increased in Wave2 cKO compared with control cells ( Fig . 3 , F to I ) . Moreover , TCR ( anti - CD3 / CD28 or OVA ) – induced phospho - rylation of FOXO1 ( forkhead box O1 ) , a tran - scription factor that modulates metabolic pathways so as to promote T cell quiescence and is inactivated by AKT - mediated phos - phorylation and nuclear exclusion ( 20 ) , was dramatically enhanced in WAVE2 - deficient compared with control T cells ( Fig . 3J and fig . S8 , F and G ) . This alteration was essentially normalized in the Wave2 cKO T cells through Torin 2 treatment ( Fig . 3K and fig . S8 , H and I ) . Thus , WAVE2 deficiency engenders aberrantly increased mTOR activation in naïve T cells along with metabolic reprogramming and FOXO1 inactivation , alterations that are known to promote the transition of T cells from quiescence to activation and functional differentiation ( 21 ) . To confirm that WAVE2 effects on T cell activation and effector differentiation relate to aberrant mTOR signaling , naïve CD4 + T cells from Wave2 cKO mice were activated with sub - optimal doses of antibodies to CD3 / CD28 and culturedinthepresenceofIL - 2 . Again , WAVE2 - deficient T cells displayed dramatic increases in cell size ; proliferation ; T - bet and GATA3 expression ; and AKT ( Ser 473 ) , S6 ( Ser 240 / 244 ) , and FOXO1 phosphorylation ( Fig . 3 , L to O ) . These defects were normalized by treating the cells with Torin 2 , suggesting that suppres - sion of mTOR signaling is essentialto WAVE2 - mediated restraints on the activation and differentiation of naïve T cells . WAVE2 is required for antigen - specific T cell immune responses Disruption of T cell homeostasis and un - restrained T cell activation are known to be associated with impaired immune responses to antigen ( 22 ) . A comparison of OVA - specific T cell responses in Wave2 cKO to control OT - II T cells revealed markedly reduced prolifera - tive response of the Wave2 cKO cells to ex vivo stimulation with OVA 323 - 339 peptide ( Fig . 4A ) . In vivo proliferative responses of Wave2 cKO OT - II T cells to OVA immunization were also reduced compared with that of control cells ( fig . S9 , A and B ) . Similarly , lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus ( LCMV ) infection yielded reduced cytotoxic T cell responses in Wave2 cKO mice as evidenced by reduced fre - quenciesandnumbersofantigen - reactiveCD8 + cells and of IFN - g – and of TNF - a – producing CD8 + T cells ( Fig . 4 , B and C ) .

Although TCR - and cytokine - induced AKT - mTOR signaling as well as steady - state meta - bolic activities are up - regulated in Wave2 cKO T cells , sustained mTOR hyperactivation has been associated with mitochondrial bioener - getic insufficiency that may be relevant to the impaired antigen responses observed in Wave2 cKO mice ( 23 ) .

S9 , C to E ) . In addition , the frequencies of apoptosis and caspase ac - tivation were significantly greater in activated T cells from OVA - immunized Wave2 cKO com - pared with control mice ( fig . S9 , F and G ) , although expression of apoptotic - regulatory factors B cell lymphoma 2 ( BCL - 2 ) and BCL - 2 – interacting mediator of cell death ( BIM ) were unaffected by a lack of WAVE2 ( fig . S9 , H and I ) . T cells from LCMV - infected Wave2 cKO mice also exhibited substantially increased expression of interferon regulatory factor 4 ( IRF4 ) ( Fig . 4D ) , a transcription factor that is induced by mTOR activation and promotes the expression of the programmed cell death protein 1 ( PD - 1 ) coinhibitory receptor impli - cated in T cell exhaustion ( 24 – 26 ) . The PD - 1 , T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 3 ( TIM - 3 ) , and lymphocyte activation gene 3 ( LAG - 3 ) coinhibitory receptors were also ab - errantly up - regulated in CD8 + T cells from LCMV - infected Wave2 cKO mice ( Fig . 4E ) . PD - 1 expression was also modestly up - regulated in effector memory , but not naïve T cells of uninfected Wave2 cKO mice ( Fig . 4F ) . Torin 2 treatment of LCMV - infected Wave2 cKO mice significantly reduced PD - 1 and IRF4 expres - sion levels and rescued T cell mitochondrial membrane potential ( Fig . 4 , G to I ) . Thus , these aberrations appear to reflect high mTOR activity as is consistent with the known role for chronic mTOR activation in promoting PD - 1 up - regulation and downstream metabolic changes that engender T cell exhaustion ( 27 ) . Together , these findings identify WAVE2 as a critical player in the coupling of antigen and cytokinestimulation to Tcelleffectorresponses because a lack of WAVE2 - mediated mTOR in - hibition engenders up - regulated co - inhibitory receptorexpression , metabolicdysfunction , and consequent T cell exhaustion . WAVE2 binds and regulates mTOR to support T cell homeostasis and function To define the molecular basis for WAVE2 ef - fects on mTOR signaling , we explored the pos - sibility that WAVE2 interacts with the mTOR complex . WAVE2 colocalized with mTOR in the cell perinuclear region ( fig . S10 , A and B ) and coimmunoprecipitated with mTOR in T cells and with MYC - tagged mTOR in trans - fected cells ( Fig . 5A ) . This association appears to be direct because glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) – tagged WAVE2 recombinant protein also precipitated recombinant MYC - tagged mTOR in vitro ( Fig . 5B ) . To delineate the structural basis for WAVE2 - mTOR associa - tion , we explored the ability of specific mTOR or WAVE2 domains to pull down WAVE2 or mTOR , respectively . The association was me - diated by binding of the WAVE2 N - terminal WHdomain to aregion ( residues1271 to 2008 ) withinmTORcontainingtheFAT ( FRAP / ATM / TRRAP ) domain , which is known to facilitate protein - protein interactions ( Fig . 5 , C to E ) . In addition to mTOR , RAPTOR ( regulatory - associated protein of mTOR ) and RICTOR ( rapamycin - insensitive companion of mTOR ) — key components of mTORC1 and mTORC2 , respectively — also coimmunoprecipitated WAVE2 ( Fig . 5F ) , suggesting that WAVE2 associates with both mTORC1 and mTORC2 in vivo . The overexpression of WAVE2 was associated with a reduction in the amounts of RAPTOR or RICTOR coimmunoprecipitated with mTOR ( Fig . 5 , G and H , and fig . S11 , A and B ) and with a reduction in mTOR acti - vation , as gauged by S6K and AKT ( Ser 473 ) phosphorylation ( Fig . 5I and fig . S11C ) . Con - versely , coprecipitationofmTORwithRAPTOR andRICTORwasincreasedinWAVE2 - deficient T cells ( Fig . 5 , J and K , and fig . S11D ) . WAVE2 ’ s inhibitory effect on mTOR activation was fur - ther demonstrated in an in vitro kinase assay showing that recombinant WAVE2 reduces mTOR - evoked 4E - BP1 and AKT ( Ser 473 ) phos - phorylation ( Fig . 5 , LandM , andfig . S11 , Eand F ) and by the finding that GFP - Cre – triggered acute deletion of WAVE2 in primary Wave2 fl / fl T cells resulted in enhanced mTOR phospho - rylation associated with increased T cell activa - tion in response to anti - CD3 / CD28 stimulation ( fig . S12 , A to C ) . Thus , WAVE2 and mTOR are binding partners in T cells , and their interac - tion is associated with the repression of mTOR activity , possibly by WAVE2 - mediated imped - ance of other effector interactions that are key to mTOR activation . To validate the central role for dysregulated mTOR activation in the immune dysfunction manifested by Wave2 cKO mice , these animals were treated with rapamycin at a dose known Liu et al . , Science 371 , eaaz4544 ( 2021 ) 26 March 2021 6 of 14 Fig . 4 .

This pharmaceutical treatment res - cued both body weight and survival in these mice ( Fig . 6 , A and B ) ; dramatically reduced lymphocytic tissue infiltration and serum IgE and antinuclear antibodies ( ANA ) levels ( Fig . 6 , C to E ) ; and suppressed the spontane - ous activation , hyperproliferation , and skewed T H 1 and T H 2 cell differentiation of WAVE2 - deficient T cells ( Fig . 6 , F to J ) . These findings are consistent with a critical role for mTOR hyperactivation in the disruption of T cell quiescence and induction of spontaneous T cell activation , effector differentiation , and autoimmunity engendered by WAVE2 defi - ciency . These results also reinforce the impor - tance of the WAVE2 - mTOR signaling axis to the regulation of T cell activation and differen - tiation required for normal immune homeo - stasis and antigen - specific immune responses . Conclusion Inherited human immunodeficiency diseases caused by cytoskeletal regulatory protein defects are often associated with clinically relevant autoimmunity , but the mechanistic underpinnings of this association are unclear ( 30 – 32 ) . We show that selective ablation of the actin - modulatory WAVE2 protein in T cells engenders both multiorgan autoimmune dis - ease and impaired antigen - specific responses , which arise , respectively , in conjunction with profound increases in the spontaneous activa - tion and accelerated effector differentiation of peripheral T cells and in the exhaustion and apoptosis of antigen - reactive T cells during antigen - driven immune responses . These de - fects are cell - intrinsic , are present despite nor - mal thymic cell maturation and selection , and collectivelyidentifyanessentialroleforWAVE2insupportingtheperipheralTcellquiescenceandimmunehomeostasisthatunderpinadap - tive immune responses . Our data also reveal the association of WAVE2 deficiency with enhanced activation of AKT - mTOR signaling .

Although the in vivo trafficking of T cells to lymphoid organs was diminished by WAVE2 deficiency , trafficking of these cells to nonlymphoid organs was increased in the Wave2 cKO mice , suggesting that mechanisms beyond actin polymerization are primarily responsible for the disruption of immune homeostasis in these animals . This conclusion is supported by our biochemical data showing that WAVE2 directly suppresses mTOR activ - ity and not only physicallybindsmTORwithin the mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes but may also impede mTOR from interacting with two effectors , RAPTOR and RICTOR , that are key to mTOR activation . These findings , together with the rescue of T cell homeostasis and function in Wave2 cKO mice treated with mTOR inhibitor , identify dysregulated AKT - mTOR signaling as a critical mechanistic factor underpinning the autoimmunity and impaired adaptive immune responses evoked by T cell – selective ablation of WAVE2 . The importance of WAVE2 to immune ho - meostasis has also been suggested by recent data identifying WAVE2 as a substrate for the leucine - rich repeat kinase 2 ( LRRK2 ) , variants of which are associated with risk for autoim - mune and neurodegenerative diseases ( 33 , 34 ) . The Rac guanosine triphosphatase , an up - stream activator or WAVE2 , as well as several other WRC components have also been impli - cated in autoimmune disease ( 7 , 32 ) . Among these latter proteins , HEM1 ( also known as NCKAP1L ) has very recently been linked to an inherited human immunodysregulatory dis - ease , with recessive loss - of - function mutations in the HEM1 gene leading to a syndrome of immunodeficiency and autoimmunity that closely resembles the Wave2 cKO clinical phe - notype ( 35 – 37 ) . The T cell anomalies detected in these patients also resemble those found in Wave2 cKO mice — including , for example , the Liu et al . , Science 371 , eaaz4544 ( 2021 ) 26 March 2021 8 of 14 Fig . 6 .

This effect of HEM1 appears to involve its function outside of the WRC , suggesting that HEM1 ’ s influence on mTORC2 may be mediated , at least in part , bymechanismsindependentofWAVE2 . More - over , the increases in inducible mTOR activa - tiondetectedin Wave2 cKO Tcellswereobserved in naïve cells and would not be expected in the context of a predominantly exhausted T cell populationthat likelyoccurs in HEM1 - deficient patients . These possibilities require further in - vestigation , but immunoregulatory inhibitory effects of WAVE2 on mTOR activation are consistent with the ability of mTOR inhibitor treatment to ameliorate both the T cell defects and the inflammatory and autoimmune phe - notype of Wave2 cKO mice . The similarities of the clinical and biochemical phenotype of Wave2 cKO mice with that found in patients with activated PI3K d syndrome ( APDS ) caused by activating mutations in genes involved in PI3K signaling ( 38 – 40 ) further establishes aberrantly activated AKT - mTOR signaling as a mechanistic pathway leading to the expres - sion of immune deficiency and autoimmunity . Thus , the demonstration that WAVE2 inhibi - tion of mTOR signaling is key to the critical role for this cytoskeletal regulator in governing T cell quiescence , homeostasis , and antigen - driven immune responses identifies the blocking of mTOR activation as a potential therapeutic avenue for suppressing pathologic T cell re - sponses that drive the immune dysregulation underlying combined immunodeficiency and autoimmune disease .

Micecarryingthefloxed Wave2 ( Wave2 fl / fl ) alleles in the germline were used as control mice and bred with Cd4 Cre mice ex - pressing the Cre recombinase under the T cell – specific Cd4 promoter ( Jackson Laboratory ) to generate conditional T cell WAVE2 knock - out ( Wave2 cKO ) mice in which WAVE2 was specifically deleted in T cells . Wave2 fl / + Cd4 Cre mice were also bred to OT - II - TCR and H - Y - TCR transgenic mice ( Jackson Laboratory , Bar Harbor ) to generate Wave2 cKO mice carrying OT - II - TCR or H - Y - TCR transgenes . Wave2 fl / fl mice were also bred with Cd4 Cre ER T2 mice in which a gene encoding a fusion of Cre recombinase and the estrogen receptor T2 moiety is recombined into the Cd4 locus ( 10 ) to generate Wave2 fl / fl Cd4 Cre Cre ER T2 mice . To induce WAVE2 deletion in peripheral CD4 + T cells , tamoxifen ( 1 mg per mouse in 50 m l ) was delivered by gavage to both Wave2 fl / fl ( control ) and Wave2 fl / fl Cd4 Cre ER T2 ( iKO ) mice ( 4 to 6 weeks old ) daily for 4 to 5 days and the mice sacrificed and studied 5 days later .
