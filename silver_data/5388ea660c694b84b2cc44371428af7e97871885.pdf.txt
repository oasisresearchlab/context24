Q . Ru Abstract . This study aimed to develop an explicit JKR - type model for adhesive contact of a rigid sphere ( of radius R ) on a compressible elastic thin layer ( of thickness h , Young’s modulus E , and Poisson ratio ν ) bonded or sliding on a rigid substrate . Based on a simple Kerr model for a compressible elastic layer , an explicit expression for strain energy of the elastic layer is derived in terms of the two JKR - type variables ( δ , a ) , where a is the radius of contact zone and δ is the indentation depth of the rigid sphere . Thus the equilibrium values of ( δ , a ) can be determined as the stationary point of the potential energy . The explicit model is justiﬁed by detailed comparison of the predicted results ( for Poisson ratio ν ≤ 0 . 45 ) with known data reported in recent literature . For example , the validity and accuracy of the present model are demonstrated for moderately soft elastic thin layers under the condition 2 (cid:2) 1 − v 2 (cid:3) WR 2 (cid:4)(cid:2) Eh 3 (cid:3) ≥ 100 ( where W is adhesion energy per unit contact area , for instance , for typical materials with R = 500 µ m E = 100 KPa and W = 100 mJ / m 2 , the condition requests h < 20 µ m ) . As compared to existing methods that request more substantial numerical calculations , the present model achieves an explicit expression for strain energy of a compressible elastic layer and could oﬀer a simpler analytical method for adhesion mechanics of a rigid sphere on a compressible thin elastic layer bonded or sliding on a rigid substrate .

Introduction The well - known Johnson – Kendall – Roberts ( JKR ) model [ 1 , 2 ] for adhesive contact between two elastic spheres is based on the classical Boussinesq solution of an elastic half - space , which cannot be applied to a thin elastic layer bonded or sliding on a rigid substrate [ 3 – 8 ] ( such as a MEMS component coated by a soft thin layer [ 3 ] or atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) on a biological shell bonded on a petri dish [ 4 , 6 ] ) . In such cases , the contact radius can be much larger than the thickness of the elastic thin layer and the classical JKR model [ 1 , 2 ] is inapplicable . Recently , a remarkable research eﬀort has been made to extend the classical JKR theory [ 1 , 2 ] to adhesive contact of a rigid sphere on an elastic layer bonded or sliding on a rigid substrate [ 9 – 23 ] . For example , Choi [ 9 ] studied adhesive contact of a rigid sphere on an elastic ﬁlm bonded to a rigid substrate by using an elasticity solution of axisymmetric indentation with an elastic ﬁlm , and concluded that the classical JKR model fails to correctly evaluate the adhesion energy between the spherical tip and the elastic ﬁlm when the contact radius is larger than the thickness of elastic ﬁlm . Yang [ 14 ] used a perturbation technique to analyze the axisymmetric indentation of a rigid sphere on a compressible elastic thin ﬁlm bonded to a rigid substrate when the contact radius is much larger than the thickness of thin ﬁlm . Sridhar et al . [ 11 , 12 ] obtained empirical relations for the indentation load and contact compliance as a function of contact radius for several practical layer – substrate material systems . Chung et al . [ 16 ] studied mechanical properties of suﬃciently thin polymer ﬁlms supported by stiﬀ substrates using AFM nanoindentation experiments . Zhu and Xu [ 18 ] investigated adhesive contact of a rigid sphere 31 Page 2 of 12 L . Zhang and C . Q . Ru ZAMP Fig . 1 . Adhesive contact of a rigid sphere on a compressible elastic thin layer bonded or sliding on a rigid substrate on an elastic ﬁlm bonded or sliding on a rigid substrate using linear fracture mechanics , and formulated a semi - analytical approach to study the relation between the indentation force , penetration depth and contact radius . However , most of the mentioned works request substantial numerical calculations , and it remains an interesting problem how to achieve a simpler explicit method to analyze adhesive contact of a rigid sphere on an elastic thin layer bonded or sliding on a rigid substrate . The present work aims to develop an explicit JKR - like model based on an expression for strain energy of an elastic layer on a rigid substrate . This paper is organized as follows . In Sect . 2 , the Kerr model is used to derive an explicit expression for strain energy of a compressible elastic layer bonded or sliding on a rigid substrate , based on which the indentation depth and contact radius can be determined as the stationary point of the potential energy . The present model is validated in Sect . 3 by detailed comparison with known data available in the recent literature . Section 4 is devoted to a further study on the role of Young’s modulus and thickness of the elastic layer in adhesion mechanics . Finally , the main conclusions are summarized in Sect . 5 . 2 . An extended JKR model based on Kerr model for a compressible elastic layer An extended JKR - type model is developed here for adhesion of a rigid sphere ( of radius R ) on a com - pressible elastic thin layer ( of Young’s modulus E and Poisson ratio ν ) of thickness h which is either perfectly bonded or sliding on a rigid substrate under the condition R (cid:2) a (cid:2) h ( see Fig . 1 ) . The adhesion contact is deﬁned by two geometrical variables ( δa ) , where δ is the indentation depth of the rigid sphere , and a is the radius of circular contact zone . The total potential energy of the rigid sphere - elastic layer system is given by U = U e − πa 2 W − Fδ , ( 1 ) where U e is the strain energy of elastic layer , F is the external indentation force applied to the rigid sphere , and W = γ 1 + γ 2 − γ 12 is the adhesion energy ( per unit area ) of contact zone , and γ 1 , γ 2 and γ 12 are the surface energy ( per unit area ) of the rigid sphere , the elastic layer and the interfacial energy of contact zone , respectively . The key problem is how to derive an explicit expression U e ( δ , a ) for the strain energy of a compressible elastic thin layer bonded or sliding on a rigid substrate , in terms of the two variables ( δ , a ) . ZAMP An extended JKR model for adhesion of a rigid sphere Page 3 of 12 31 Clearly , strain energy U e of the elastic layer can be calculated by U e ( a , δ ) = 1 2 a (cid:5) 0 2 πp ( r ) w ( r ) r d r , ( 2 ) where w ( r ) is the surface deﬂection of the elastic layer , and p ( r ) is the surface pressure in the circular contact zone ( 0 ≤ r ≤ a ) . In what follows , the pressure p ( r ) inside the contact zone will be determined by Kerr model [ 24 ] which oﬀers a simple diﬀerential relationship between the surface deﬂection w ( r ) and the surface pressure p ( r ) inside the contact zone . 2 . 1 . Kerr model for a compressible elastic thin layer on a rigid substrate It is known that the Kerr model [ 24 ] gives a simple diﬀerential relation between the surface pressure p and the downward surface deﬂection w of an elastic layer ( of thickness h ) on a rigid substrate . For example , up to the second - order diﬀerential terms , the Kerr model in axisymmetric case gives w − Ah 2 ∇ 2 w = C h E p − Dh 3 E ∇ 2 p , ( 3 ) where ∇ 2 = (cid:6) ∂ 2 ∂r 2 + 1 r ∂∂r (cid:7) , E is Young’s modulus of the elastic layer , and A , C , D are some nonnegative constants determined by the Poisson ratio ν of the elastic layer . For an elastic layer bonded on a rigid substrate [ 25 ] A = 1 1 − ν , C = ( 1 − 2 ν ) ( 1 + ν ) 1 − ν , D = ( 3 − 4 ν ) ( 1 + ν ) 3 ( 1 − ν ) , ( 4 ) and for an elastic layer sliding on a rigid substrate [ 24 ] A = 1 3 , C = 1 − ν 2 , D = 1 − ν 2 3 . ( 5 ) Similar to existing related works [ 9 , 11 , 12 , 14 ] , let us focus on compressible elastic layers with ν < 0 . 5 , and thus C (cid:5) = 0 . Therefore , all results given in this paper are applied to either a bonded compressible layer or a ( compressible / incompressible ) sliding layer , but should not be applied to a bonded incompressible layer ( for which C = 0 in Eq . ( 4 ) ) . 2 . 2 . Pressure p ( r ) inside contact zone Assume that the rigid sphere of radius R penetrates into the elastic layer by depth δ , with a circular contact zone of radius a . Thus , inside the contact zone ( r ≤ a ) between the rigid sphere and the elastic layer , the axisymmetric surface ( downward ) deﬂection w ( r ) of the elastic layer is given by ( see Fig . 1 , with R (cid:2) a ) w ( r ) = (cid:8) R 2 − r 2 − R + δ ≈ δ − r 2 2 R . ( 6 ) It follows from Kerr model ( Eq . 3 ) that the surface pressure p ( r ) inside the contact zone is determined by the second - order diﬀerential equation C h E p − Dh 3 E ∇ 2 p ≈ (cid:9) δ + 2 Ah 2 R (cid:10) − (cid:9) 1 − 4 A h 2 R 2 (cid:10) r 2 2 R . ( 7 ) An exact particular solution of the above non - homogeneous equation is of the form p ( r ) = c + dr 2 ( 8 ) 31 Page 4 of 12 L . Zhang and C . Q . Ru ZAMP with two coeﬃcients c and d given by c = E C (cid:11)(cid:9) δ h + 2 A h R (cid:10) − 2 hD CR (cid:9) 1 − 4 A h 2 R 2 (cid:10)(cid:12) , d = − E 2 hCR (cid:9) 1 − 4 A h 2 R 2 (cid:10) . ( 9 ) Under the assumed conditions R (cid:2) a (cid:2) h ( i . e . , (cid:2) aR (cid:3) 2 (cid:7) 1 and (cid:2) ha (cid:3) 2 (cid:7) 1 ) , we have c ≈ E C (cid:11)(cid:9) δ h (cid:10) + 2 (cid:9) A − D C (cid:10) h R (cid:12) , d ≈ − E 2 hCR . ( 10 ) Since the homogeneous equation C hE p − D h 3 E ∇ 2 p = 0 is a modiﬁed Bessel equation of order 0 ( the solution is given by eI 0 (cid:6)(cid:13) CD rh (cid:7) ) , the general solution p ( r ) of Eq . ( 7 ) inside the contact zone is given by p ( r ) = eI 0 (cid:14)(cid:15) C D r h (cid:16) + c + dr 2 , 0 ≤ r ≤ a , ( 11 ) where I 0 (cid:6)(cid:13) CD rh (cid:7) is the zeroth - order modiﬁed Bessel function of the ﬁrst kind which becomes inﬁnite at inﬁnity and remains bounded at (cid:13) CD rh = 0 , and the coeﬃcient e is to be determined by an extra condition derived by Betti reciprocal theorem as shown below . Here , it should be noted that , unlike elastic contact of a rigid sphere on an elastic layer without adhesion ( for which p ( a ) = 0 at r = a inside contact zone , see [ 20 ] ) , adhesive contact of JKR type causes a nonzero value of p ( a ) at r = a inside contact zone . ( Actually , it is known from JKR model [ 1 , 2 ] that p ( r ) can be tensile and even inﬁnite as r = a is approached inside contact zone . ) In addition , the slope of deﬂection d w d r is generally discontinuous at the edge r = a of contact zone . Therefore , for the present adhesive contact problem , the only continuity condition imposed at the edge r = a is the continuity of the deﬂection w ( r ) . 2 . 3 . Deﬂection w ( r ) of elastic layer outside contact zone The coeﬃcient e in Eq . ( 11 ) will be determined in Sect . 2 . 4 by an application of Betti reciprocal theorem to the entire elastic layer . For this end , the deﬂection w ( r ) outside the contact zone ( r > a ) needs to be determined . Outside the contact zone ( r > a ) , the deﬂection w ( r ) is determined by Kerr model ( Eq . 3 ) with the continuity condition of w ( r ) on the edge r = a of contact zone as follows w − Ah 2 (cid:9) ∂ 2 ∂r 2 + 1 r ∂ ∂r (cid:10) w = 0 ; w | r = ∞ = 0 , w | r = a = w a = (cid:9) δ − a 2 2 R (cid:10) . ( 12 ) Equation ( 12 ) is written as the modiﬁed Bessel equation of order 0 and variable s ( deﬁned by s = r h √ A ) w ( s ) − (cid:9) d 2 w d s 2 + 1 s d w d s (cid:10) = 0 . ( 13 ) Thus , the solution of Eq . ( 12 ) is given by w ( r ) = bK 0 (cid:9) r h √ A (cid:10) , b = w a K 0 (cid:6) a h √ A (cid:7) , ( 14 ) where K 0 ( s ) is the zeroth - order modiﬁed Bessel function of the second kind which goes to zero at inﬁnity and becomes inﬁnity at s = 0 , and b is a constant coeﬃcient determined by the edge condition w | r = a = w a . ZAMP An extended JKR model for adhesion of a rigid sphere Page 5 of 12 31 2 . 4 . Determination of the coeﬃcient ( Betti theorem ) To use Betti reciprocal theorem , let us consider the uniform deﬂection w 0 of the elastic layer under a uniform surface pressure p 0 , related by the Kerr model as follows w 0 = C h E p 0 . ( 15 ) Thus , since no mechanical work appears on the bottom interface between the elastic layer and the rigid substrate for a bonded layer or a sliding layer , it follows from Betti reciprocal theorem that 2 πp 0 ∞ (cid:5) 0 w ( r ) r d r = 2 πC h E p 0 a (cid:5) 0 p ( r ) r d r ( 16 ) Inside the contact zone , w ( r ) is given by Eq . ( 6 ) and p ( r ) is given by Eq . ( 11 ) with the constants c and d given by Eq . ( 10 ) . Outside the contact zone , p ( r ) = 0 and w ( r ) is given by Eq . ( 14 ) . Thus , substituting the expressions of w ( r ) ( Eq . 6 ) and p ( r ) ( Eq . 11 ) and the expressions of c and d ( Eq . 10 ) into Eq . ( 16 ) and using the formulas d d x [ xI 1 ( x ) ] = xI 0 ( x ) ; d d x [ xK 1 ( x ) ] = − xK 0 ( x ) , ( 17 ) where K 1 ( x ) is the ﬁrst - order modiﬁed Bessel function of the second kind , and I 1 ( x ) is the ﬁrst - order modiﬁed Bessel function of the ﬁrst kind , we get √ A (cid:9) δ − a 2 2 R (cid:10) K 1 (cid:6) a h √ A (cid:7) K 0 (cid:6) a h √ A (cid:7) = Ch E e (cid:15) D C I 1 (cid:14)(cid:15) C D a h (cid:16) + (cid:9) A − D C (cid:10) ah R . ( 18 ) Finally , the coeﬃcient e is expressed , in terms of ( δ , a ) , by e ( a , δ ) = √ A (cid:6) δ − a 2 2 R (cid:7) K 1 (cid:6) ah √ A (cid:7) K 0 (cid:6) ah √ A (cid:7) − (cid:2) A − DC (cid:3) ahR hE √ CDI 1 (cid:6)(cid:13) CD ah (cid:7) ( 19 ) 2 . 5 . Explicit expression of U e for a compressible elastic layer on a rigid substrate Thus , by introducing Eqs . ( 6 ) and ( 11 ) into Eq . ( 2 ) , the strain energy U e ( δ , a ) of a compressible elastic layer , as a function of ( δ , a ) , is given by U e ( a , δ ) = π (cid:17) eδah (cid:15) D C I 1 (cid:14)(cid:15) C D a h (cid:16) − e 2 R Y + cδa 2 2 − ca 4 8 R + d δa 4 4 − d a 6 12 R (cid:18) ( 20 ) where Y = Da 2 h 2 C (cid:17)(cid:15) C D a hI 1 (cid:14)(cid:15) C D a h (cid:16) − 2 I 2 (cid:14)(cid:15) C D a h (cid:16)(cid:18) ( 21 ) and c and d are determined by Eq . ( 10 ) and e is determined by Eq . ( 19 ) . Substituting the derived expression of U e ( a , δ ) ( Eq . 20 ) into the total potential energy U ( Eq . 1 ) gives U = π (cid:17) eδah (cid:15) D C I 1 (cid:14)(cid:15) C D a h (cid:16) − e 2 RY + cδa 2 2 − ca 4 8 R + d δa 4 4 − d a 6 12 R (cid:18) − πa 2 W − Fδ . ( 22 ) Thus , the equilibrium values of ( δ , a ) can be determined by the two equilibrium conditions “ ∂U / ∂δ = 0” and “ ∂U / ∂a = 0” in terms of all given parameters , with the coeﬃcients A , C and D given by Eq . ( 4 ) for a compressible bonded layer , or with the coeﬃcients A , C , and D given by Eq . ( 5 ) for 31 Page 6 of 12 L . Zhang and C . Q . Ru ZAMP Fig . 2 .

Compared to existing methods [ 11 , 12 , 14 , 16 ] , only for a bonded layer that request more substantial numerical calculations , the present model is characterized by an explicit expression ( 20 ) for strain energy of the compressible elastic layer and could oﬀer a simpler analytical method for a bonded or a sliding layer on a rigid substrate . 3 . Comparison with known data for a bonded compressible layer Now let us ﬁrst compare the results given by the present model with some known data available in the recent literature on adhesion of a rigid sphere on a compressible elastic layer ( for Poisson ratio ν ≤ 0 . 45 ) bonded on a rigid substrate . 3 . 1 . Without an external force ( F = 0 ) ( ν ≤ 0 . 45 ) First , let us consider the case in the absence of an applied force ( F = 0 ) . Through solving the two equilibrium equations “ ∂U / ∂δ = 0” and “ ∂U / ∂a = 0” with F = 0 , we calculate the normalized contact radius a 0 (cid:19) 4 E / (cid:2) 9 πWR 2 (cid:2) 1 − v 2 (cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:20) with respect to a non - dimensional parameter α deﬁned by α = (cid:13)(cid:2) 2 ( 1 − v 2 ) WR 2 (cid:4) ( Eh 3 ) (cid:3) ( 23 ) for Poisson ratio ν = 0 . 2 or ν = 0 . 3 or ν = 0 . 45 , respectively , as shown in Fig . 2 , with a comparison to Sridhar et al . ’s numerical results ( see Fig . 7 ( a ) in [ 12 ] ) . Figure 2 shows that our results well ﬁt Sridhar et al . ’s results for the cases of a bonded compressible layer ( ν ≤ 0 . 45 ) under the condition α ≥ 1 , with the relative error less than 10 % . Therefore , it is concluded that the results predicted by the present model are in good agreement with known data ( with relative errors less than 10 % ) under the condition that the bonded compressible ( ν ≤ 0 . 45 ) elastic thin layer is relatively soft so that 2 (cid:2) 1 − v 2 (cid:3) WR 2 (cid:4)(cid:2) Eh 3 (cid:3) ≥ 1 for case F = 0 .

With an external force ( F (cid:3) = 0 ) Now let us make detailed comparison of the present model with available known data in the case of an applied force F (cid:5) = 0 . 3 . 2 . 1 . Comparison with Sridhar et al . [ 12 ] ( ν ≤ 0 . 45 ) : In the case of an applied force F (cid:5) = 0 , through solving the two equilibrium equations ( “ ∂U / ∂δ = 0” and “ ∂U / ∂a = 0” ) and using the condition d F / d a = 0 , we plot the normalized pull - oﬀ force F oﬀ / ( 3 πWR ) with respect to a non - dimensional parameter α ( deﬁned by Eq . ( 23 ) ) for the cases of a compressible layer ( Poisson ratio ν = 0 . 2 or ν = 0 . 3 or ν = 0 . 45 ) , respectively , as shown in Fig . 3 , in comparison with the results of Sridhar et al . ( see Fig . 6 ( a ) in [ 12 ] ) . Figure 3 shows that our results for the normalized pull - oﬀ force F oﬀ / ( 3 πWR ) agree well to Sridhar et al . ’s results ( with the relative error less than 10 % ) under the condition α ≥ 10 . It is concluded that the results for pull - oﬀ force predicted by the present model are in good agreement with known data ( with relative errors less than 10 % ) under the condition that the bonded compressible ( ν ≤ 0 . 45 ) elastic thin layer is relatively soft so that 2 (cid:2) 1 − v 2 (cid:3) WR 2 / (cid:2) Eh 3 (cid:3) ≥ 100 for case F (cid:5) = 0 . 3 . 2 . 2 . Comparison with Choi [ 9 ] ( ν = 0 . 3 ) : In addition , the dimensionless pulling force − F (cid:4)(cid:2) μh 2 (cid:3) ( μ is shear modulus deﬁned by μ = E (cid:4) ( 2 ( 1 + v ) ) ) is calculated against a / h for two values of R / h ( R / h = 10 and R / h = 100 ) with Poisson ratio v = 0 . 3 . Then , using the condition d (cid:2) − F (cid:4)(cid:2) μh 2 (cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:4) d ( a / h ) = 0 , the relations between a non - dimensional parameter α 2 / ( 1 − v ) ( i . e . , WR 2 / (cid:2) μh 3 (cid:3) used in Choi’s results in [ 9 ] ) , where α is deﬁned by Eq . ( 23 ) , the normalized contact radius at pull - oﬀ a oﬀ / h , and the associated normalized pull - oﬀ force − F oﬀ / (cid:2) μh 2 (cid:3) are obtained and plotted in Figs . 4 and 5 , respectively , with a comparison to Choi’s results ( see the Figs . 6 and 8 in [ 9 ] ) and the JKR model ( included in Choi’s Figs . 6 and 8 in [ 9 ] ) . Figure 4 shows that our results for the normalized contact radius at pull - oﬀ a oﬀ / h well ﬁt to Choi’s results within the range of the non - dimensional parameter α 2 / ( 1 − v ) ≥ 1 . 5 ( approximately , α 2 ≥ 1 ) with relative errors less than 10 % , consistent with our previous conclusion shown for the comparison with Sridhar’s results ( see Fig . 2 ) . On the other hand , Fig . 5 shows that our results for the associated normalized pull - oﬀ force − F oﬀ / (cid:2) μh 2 (cid:3) for both R / h = 10 and R / h = 100 ﬁt well to Choi’s results with relative errors less than 10 % when the normalized contact radius at pull - oﬀ a oﬀ / h ≥ 4 ( approximately , α 2 / ( 1 − v ) ≥ 150 or α 2 ≥ 100 , as shown in Fig . 4 ) , also consistent with our previous conclusion shown for the comparison with Sridhar’s results ( see Fig . 3 ) . 31 Page 8 of 12 L .

Comparison for the non - dimensional parameter α 2 / ( 1 − v ) ( α is deﬁned by Eq . 23 ) versus the normalized contact radius at pull - oﬀ a oﬀ / h with JKR model and Choi’s model [ 9 ] ( Poisson ratio ν = 0 . 3 ) Fig . 5 . Comparison for the normalized pull - oﬀ force − F oﬀ / (cid:2) μh 2 (cid:3) versus the normalized contact radius at pull - oﬀ a oﬀ / h with JKR model and Choi’s model [ 9 ] a R / h = 10 ; b R / h = 100 ( Poisson ratio ν = 0 . 3 ) Therefore , it is concluded that the present model for adhesion of a rigid sphere on a compressible elastic layer bonded on a rigid substrate is valid with robust accuracy under the condition that the compressible thin layer ( deﬁned by ν ≤ 0 . 45 ) is relatively soft so that α 2 = 2 (cid:2) 1 − v 2 (cid:3) WR 2 (cid:4)(cid:2) Eh 3 (cid:3) ≥ 1 in the absence of an external force ( F = 0 ) or α 2 = 2 (cid:2) 1 − v 2 (cid:3) WR 2 (cid:4)(cid:2) Eh 3 (cid:3) ≥ 100 for a pulling force F < 0 . Since the contact radius a is expected to increase with the indentation force F and reaches its minimum value with the pulling - oﬀ force , this conclusion is consistent with the fact that Kerr model ( Eq . 3 ) for a thin elastic layer , on which the present model is based , is increasingly accurate under the assumption a (cid:2) h .

It is seen from Fig . 6 that the results predicted by the present model are in good agreement with Yang’s results . Also , as shown in Fig . 6 , both our model and Yang’s model predict that , for the same contact area , higher indentation force is required for a thin layer than for an elastic half - space ( predicted by the JKR theory ) . In addition , higher pull - oﬀ force is required to separate the indenter from a thin elastic layer than that to separate the indenter from an elastic half - space as given by the JKR theory , as shown in Fig . 6 . 4 . Eﬀects of Young’s modulus and thickness of the elastic layer ( ν = 0 . 4 ) The comparisons with known data shown in Sect . 3 indicate that the present model based on Kerr model for a thin elastic layer [ Eq . ( 3 ) , which is increasingly accurate under the assumption a (cid:2) h ] is reasonably accurate for adhesion - driven contact of a rigid sphere on a softer thin layer on a rigid substrate . In this section , the role of Young’s modulus and thickness of the elastic layer will be further studied with reference to recent results of Zhu and Xu [ 18 ] for Poisson ratio v = 0 . 4 and various values of the non - dimensional parameter α 2 ( α is deﬁned by Eq .

Ru ZAMP Fig . 7 . a the normalized contact radius a ∗ versus normalized applied force F ∗ , and b the normalized applied force F ∗ versus the normalized indent depth δ ∗ , with diﬀerent values of the non - dimensional parameter α 2 ( α is deﬁned by Eq . 23 ) for a bonded or a sliding layer ( Poisson ratio ν = 0 . 4 ) we examine the case α 2 ≥ 100 with four values α 2 = 100 , α 2 = 2500 , α 2 = 2 . 5 × 10 5 and α 2 = 1 . 0 × 10 8 ( approximately , h ∗ = 0 . 1 , h ∗ = 0 . 05 , h ∗ = 0 . 01 and h ∗ = 0 . 001 , respectively ) Figure 7a shows that within the range of α 2 ≥ 100 , the normalized pull - oﬀ forces F oﬀ needed to separate the rigid sphere from the elastic layer bonded or sliding on a rigid substrate keep almost un - changed ( around F oﬀ = F ∗ oﬀ ( 3 πWR ) = − 0 . 65 ( 3 πWR ) ≈ − 6 WR ) , which is consistent with Sridhar et al . ’s results ( see Fig . 6 ( a ) in [ 12 ] or our Fig . 3 ) . In other words , if the parameters satisfy the condition ( α 2 = 2 (cid:2) 1 − v 2 (cid:3) WR 2 (cid:4)(cid:2) Eh 3 (cid:3) ≥ 100 and ν ≤ 0 . 45 ) , the pull - oﬀ force predicted by the present model is insensitive to the Young’s modulus and thickness of the elastic layer . Meanwhile , it is seen from Fig . 7a that with the same value of α 2 , the contact radius at pull - oﬀ case and the contact radius with ( F = 0 ) predicted for a sliding elastic layer are larger than those for a bonded elastic layer under otherwise iden - tical conditions , in qualitative agreement with Zhu and Xu’s results ( see Fig . 2 in [ 18 ] ) . Here , it should be noted that , similar with Zhu and Xu’s assumption [ 18 ] , the sliding layer is assumed to slide but yet remain contact to the rigid substrate and thus can support a pulling force . In addition , Fig . 7b shows that in the absence of the applied force ( F = 0 ) , with the same value of α 2 , the indentation depth pre - dicted for a sliding layer is larger than those for a bonded layer under otherwise identical conditions , also qualitatively consistent with Zhu and Xu’s results ( see Fig . 5 in [ 18 ] ) . Thus , it is concluded that for adhesion - driven contact of a rigid sphere on a soft thin compressible ( ν ≤ 0 . 45 ) layer bonded or sliding on a rigid substrate ( deﬁned by α 2 = 2 (cid:2) 1 − v 2 (cid:3) WR 2 (cid:4)(cid:2) Eh 3 (cid:3) ≥ 100 ) , the pull - oﬀ force predicted by our model keeps almost unchanged ( F oﬀ ≈ − 6 WR ) , insensitive to the Young’s modulus and thickness of the elastic layer . In addition , the contact radius at pull - oﬀ case , the contact radius and the indentation depth with ( F = 0 ) predicted for a sliding layer are larger than those for a bonded layer under otherwise identical conditions . ZAMP An extended JKR model for adhesion of a rigid sphere Page 11 of 12 31 5 . Conclusions An extended JKR model is proposed in this paper to examine adhesion contact of a rigid sphere ( of radius R ) on a compressible elastic thin layer ( of thickness h , Young’s modulus E and Poisson ratio ν ) bonded or sliding on a rigid substrate . The present model is based on an explicit expression for strain energy of the elastic layer derived from Kerr’s model in terms of the two JKR - type variables ( a , δ ) , where a is the radius of contact zone and δ is the indent depth of the rigid particle . Our main results are summarized as follows 1 . An explicit expression for strain energy of the elastic layer is derived , based on which the equilibrium values of contact radius and indentation depth ( a , δ ) can be determined as the stationary point of the potential energy . 2 . The results given by the present model agree well to known data with relative errors typically less than 10 % for adhesion - driven contact of a rigid sphere on a soft thin compressible layer under the conditions ν ≤ 0 . 45 and 2 (cid:2) 1 − v 2 (cid:3) WR 2 (cid:4)(cid:2) Eh 3 (cid:3) ≥ 100 ( where W is the adhesion energy per unit contact area , for instance , for typical materials with R = 500 µ m E = 100 KPa and W = 100 mJ / m 2 , the condition requests h < 20 µ m ) . Since the Kerr model for a thin elastic layer , on which the present model is based , is increasingly accurate under the assumption a (cid:2) h , this condition “2 (cid:2) 1 − v 2 (cid:3) WR 2 (cid:4)(cid:2) Eh 3 (cid:3) ≥ 100” actually ensures that the contact radius a is large as compared to the thickness of soft elastic thin layer 3 . When the conditions listed in 2 ) are met , the present model predicts that the pull - oﬀ force needed to separate the rigid sphere from an elastic layer bonded or sliding on a rigid substrate is nearly F oﬀ ≈ − 6 WR , in agreement with some known results , which is insensitive to the Young’s modulus and thickness of the elastic layer . 4 . Based on the assumption that a sliding layer is sliding but yet remain contact to the rigid substrate , the present model predicts that the contact radius at pull - oﬀ case , the contact radius and the indentation depth in the absence of the applied force ( F = 0 ) for a sliding layer are larger than those for a bonded layer under otherwise identical conditions , also in agreement with some known results .
