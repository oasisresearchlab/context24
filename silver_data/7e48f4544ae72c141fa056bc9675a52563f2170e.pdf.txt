We show that attention is preferentially deployed to stimuli 28 matching a target template , even when alternate strategies would reduce the number of searches 29 necessary . We argue that this effect is an involuntary consequence of goal - directed processing , 30 and show that it can be reduced when ample time is provided to prepare for search . These results 31 support the notion that capacity - limited cognitive processes contribute to the biased selection of 32 information that characterizes confirmation bias . 33 Keywords : Attention , Visual Search , Decision - Making , Confirmation Bias 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 Running Head : CONFIRMATION BIAS IN VISUAL SEARCH 3 Introduction 48 Although the claim that humans are rational is central to traditional economic and legal 49 thinking , experimental psychology has uncovered many situations where our reasoning is limited 50 or biased ( Tversky & Kahneman , 1981 ) . One of the most well - known cognitive biases is 51 confirmation bias , wherein selection and evaluation of information that would confirm a focal 52 hypothesis is given priority – or even exclusivity ( Nickerson , 1998 ) . As a consequence , ill - 53 founded beliefs can persist , as contradictory evidence tends to be ignored , underweighted , or 54 even misinterpreted as evidence in favor of existing beliefs . The bias can be found in a wide 55 variety of domains , from problem - solving and reasoning ( Wason , 1960 ; 1966 ) , to real - world 56 settings including law ( Kassin , Dror , & Kukuchka , 2013 ) , medicine ( Pines , 2006 ) , and science 57 ( Fugelsang , Stein , Green , & Dunbar , 2004 ) . Although confirmation bias is often studied in the 58 context of explicit reasoning , selection occurs in nearly every stage of human information 59 processing , including vision , where attentional mechanisms have been researched extensively 60 ( see Carrasco , 2011 , for a review ) . In this paper , we pursue the question of whether visual 61 selection exhibits a confirmation bias ; specifically , when searching for a particular stimulus in a 62 noisy environment , is the search confirmatory in nature . First , however , we highlight the 63 connections between several theories of confirmation bias and theories of selective visual 64 processing . 65 Of those theories that seek to account for confirmation bias in terms of psychological 66 processes , many have implicated cognitive mechanisms of selection in one form or another 67 ( Kunda , 1990 ; Doherty , Mynatt , & Dragan , 1993 ; Neuberg , 1994 , Sanbonmatsu et al . , 1998 ) . For 68 example , Kunda ( 1990 ) has argued that confirmation bias in reasoning is due to a biased search 69 through memory for information that is consistent with one’s goal . The core notion is that , when 70 Running Head : CONFIRMATION BIAS IN VISUAL SEARCH 4 seeking information for the purposes of a particular goal , cognitive processes increase the 71 availability of information from memory that supports the goal . Such selective activation leads to 72 the biased strengthening of the goal - centered proposition , where information that is inconsistent 73 with the proposition is relatively less salient or available than consistent information . Other 74 accounts stress the notion of capacity limits in reasoning , such as Evans’ ( 2006 ) heuristic - 75 analytic model of reasoning which states that when reasoning about hypothetical possibilities , we 76 are limited to the consideration of a single hypothesis at a given time . Similarly , Doherty , 77 Mynatt , and colleagues ( 1990 ; 1991 ; 1993 ) suggest that failing to optimally test multiple 78 hypotheses is due to limitations of working memory ; only one possible interpretation of evidence 79 ( i . e . , only one hypothesis ) can be held in working memory at a time , and so participants can only 80 reason about the conclusions drawn from evidence contingent on this hypothesis . Both of these 81 proposals bear some similarity to Koehler ' s notion of conditional reference frames ( 1991 ) , but 82 Doherty and Mynatt’s account points specifically to capacity limitations in working memory as 83 the cause of participants ' tendency to evaluate one possibility at a time . 84 While the aforementioned proposals are intended to explain the particular way that we 85 search for information , the features of these accounts are analogous in many ways to features in 86 accounts of another type of search : visual search . Many theories of top - down visual selection 87 also propose that information processing is biased towards goal - relevant information , and that 88 core information processing units have a limited capacity . Guided Search ( Wolfe , 1998 ; 2004 ) , 89 Feature Integration Theory ( Triesman & Sato , 1990 ) , the Theory of Visual Attention ( Bundesen , 90 1990 ) , the Boolean Map Theory of Visual Attention ( Huang & Pashler , 2007 ) , and Biased 91 Competition ( Desimone & Duncan , 1995 ) all state that visual search is guided , biased , or 92 otherwise prioritized towards stimuli matching some template of the stimulus that is being 93 Running Head : CONFIRMATION BIAS IN VISUAL SEARCH 5 searched for , whether that be through applying gain to template - matching stimuli or through 94 suppressing of template - mismatching stimuli . In addition , research on the role of working 95 memory in visual search guidance has led some investigators to conclude that visual selection 96 can only be guided by a single template at a time ( Olivers et al . , 2011 ; but see Beck , 97 Hollingworth , & Luck , 2012 ) . These theorized mechanisms allow for more economical 98 processing of visual information , so that aspects of the visual input that are task - relevant can 99 receive preferential processing . However , prioritizing stimuli that are similar to a target template , 100 paired with the limitation of a single template being maintained , is theoretically sufficient to 101 produce a confirmation bias in visual search . If we consider the target template as a hypothetical 102 visual state , evidence for alternative visual states will take longer to accumulate to the extent that 103 this information is incongruent with features in the template . This sort of visual guidance is 104 confirmatory ; information that supports the presence of goal - relevant information is increased in 105 salience . Moreover , in the case where critical visual information is fleeting , alternative states 106 may never reach awareness during episodes of heightened top - down guidance . The latter 107 possibility has been demonstrated in studies of inattentional blindness , where conspicuous events 108 go unnoticed while one is engaged in a demanding visual task , despite no change in sensory 109 input ( Mack & Rock , 1998 ; Simons & Chabris , 1999 ) . For example , observers are readily able 110 to maintain the mundane percept of “people playing basketball” in the face of visual information 111 that is grossly inconsistent with this interpretation : namely , a gorilla walking through the middle 112 of the group . 113 Though the evidence to date supports the possibility that top - down visual selection 114 mechanisms may automatically lead to confirmatory searching , the design of visual search tasks 115 encourages confirmatory selection as a useful strategy , and so confirmatory searching could be a 116 Running Head : CONFIRMATION BIAS IN VISUAL SEARCH 6 voluntarily adopted strategy . In the typical visual search task , the task goal is to report whether a 117 target is present or absent in a given array of stimuli , any one of which could be the target 118 stimuli . In such tasks , where a target can be present or absent , distractors ( or non - targets ) provide 119 no information about the potential target , making a confirmatory search strategy optimal . The 120 proposition “there is a target” can be verified in less time ( on target - present trials ) than it can be 121 falsified because registration of the presence of a target stimulus can occur before every stimulus 122 in the display is fully processed , providing sufficient information to execute the correct response . 123 Falsification of target presence , however , cannot be completed until all stimuli are analysed to 124 the level of response - discriminating categories . Therefore , it is unclear whether visual selection 125 is confirmatory by its nature , or whether confirmatory selection is simply adopted as a useful 126 strategy for visual search . 127 To determine whether top - down visual guidance has a confirmation bias by default , or 128 whether this potential bias may simply result from tasks demands , it is necessary to provide a 129 direct measurement of the perceptual hypothesis testing used in visual search . To this end we 130 used a task where on each trial a target stimulus could have one of two features , with each 131 conjunction of target identity and target feature being equally probable . To assess confirmatory 132 searching , one particular conjunction was designated as a target template by framing the search 133 as a question that was to be answered about a given search display . In each search , a variable 134 proportion of distractor stimuli possessed the template - matching feature , with the remaining 135 proportion possessing the template - mismatching feature . By measuring search times , we are able 136 to determine whether participants perseverate on searching through template matching stimuli – 137 those that could confirm the presence of the target defined in the template , if inspected with 138 Running Head : CONFIRMATION BIAS IN VISUAL SEARCH 7 covert attention – instead of opting to search through template mismatching stimuli – those that 139 could , when inspected , disconfirm the presence of the target defined in the template . 140 For example , imagine a search where one is instructed to report whether the letter “p” 141 that appeared once in a given display was blue , knowing that a lone p , amongst other letters , 142 would be present in the display in some color . Eight letters onset , two of which are red , and six 143 of which are blue . If one takes “p is blue” as a perceptual hypothesis , and searches so as to 144 confirm this hypothesis , then one will prioritize the blue stimuli in search , as they are potential 145 exemplars of the target template . On the other hand , a clever observer may realize that , in this 146 situation , disconfirming the hypothesis “p is blue” would require less work , as only two stimuli 147 need be expected before sufficient information has been collected to provide a response . If this 148 searcher scans the red letters and finds a p , they may report that the p is not blue . If a red p is not 149 found , one can then conclude that the p must be blue . 150 Because the target letter is always present in a display , participants can always infer the 151 feature of the target stimulus by an exhaustive search through the smallest subset of colored 152 stimuli . Although a number of studies have investigated the guidance of attention to a subset of a 153 display ( Bacon & Egeth , 1997 ; Sobel & Cave , 2002 ) , in these tasks no stimuli on their own can 154 provide information against the target’s presence , and so it is not possible for the observer to 155 adopt a strategy of disconfirmation . 156 Our goal in using this paradigm was to determine whether visual search exhibited 157 confirmation bias . A confirmation bias would comprise any tendency to prioritize search stimuli 158 that matched the target template over those that did not ; in other words , a bias to search stimuli 159 that would lead to a “yes” response , with respect to the question of whether the target defined by 160 the template was present in the display . In Experiment 1 , we demonstrate that indeed it does , and 161 Running Head : CONFIRMATION BIAS IN VISUAL SEARCH 8 subsequent experiments were conducted in order to home in on the locus of the bias . In doing so , 162 we entertained two broad possibilities : that confirmation bias in search results from failure of a 163 top - down search strategy ( i . e . , a failure to recognize that the minimal search strategy exists ) , or 164 that confirmation bias in search results from relatively automatic search heuristics , possibly 165 arising from mechanisms underlying intertrial priming ( Kristjánsson , Wang , & Nakayama , 166 2002 ) . Specifically , intertrial priming could lead to confirmatory searching if stimulus selection 167 is primarily driven by a biased selection history for template - matching colors initiated by early 168 confirmatory searches . 169 Experiment 1 170 Experiment 1 was designed to assess whether confirmation bias exists in visual search . 171 More specifically , our goal was to determine whether participants would perseverate in searching 172 using a given target template even when this strategy was inefficient ( i . e . , more stimuli had to be 173 examined ) . By manipulating the proportion of search stimuli possessing a template - matching 174 feature , we were able to track participants’ search behavior by measuring the response time cost 175 associated with increasing the size of the target - matching stimulus subset . This allows us to 176 contrast two theoretically possible search styles ; a confirmatory search strategy ( i . e . , 177 confirmation bias ; search through the template - matching color ) , and a minimal search strategy 178 ( i . e . , an ideal performer ; search through the minority color ) . Although both strategies allow for 179 the eventual , veridical confirmation or disconfirmation of the target template , they differ in the 180 priority of the two conclusions : under a confirmatory strategy , confirmation of the presence of 181 stimuli matching the target template will take less time than disconfirmation . This difference can 182 be seen in the predicted search times that follow from the two search strategies . 183 Running Head : CONFIRMATION BIAS IN VISUAL SEARCH 9 The confirmatory search strategy , in which stimulus selection is biased towards those 184 stimuli that would confirm the target template , predicts a monotonic increase in search time as 185 the proportion of template - color matching stimuli increase , and a response time benefit when the 186 search target matches the search template . 1 The minimal search strategy , in which stimulus 187 selection is intended to minimize the number of stimulus inspections necessary to produce a 188 response , predicts a quadratic relationship between the proportion of template - color matching 189 stimuli and response time , with the longest searches occurring when there is an equal proportion 190 of template - color matching stimuli and template - color mismatching stimuli , and a reduction in 191 search time as the smaller subset of stimuli reduces in size . In addition , the minimal search 192 strategy predicts no consistent relationship between whether the target stimulus matches or does 193 not match the search template , as the template adopted for a given search would depend on 194 which stimulus color was in the minority . The two factors , Color Proportion and Color Match , 195 should therefore produce a cross - over interaction effect on search times with a minimal search 196 strategy . A sample search instruction and illustration of the predictions of these two strategies is 197 provided in Figure 1 . 198 A third possible strategy , not pictured , is that participants will not use color to guide 199 search at all , but instead inspect items randomly and , after finding the target letter , report its 200 color . Because this strategy is insensitive to color in the selection stage , it predicts a flat search 201 slope across the target - matching subset conditions , and an overall response time cost for 202 reporting the target when it appears in a template - mismatching color . 203 1 In addition , a 2 : 1 ratio between search slopes for trials where the target appears in the template mismatching color and trials where the target appears in the template matching color could occur . However , this prediction requires the very strict assumption that selection of stimuli is completely color - based , i . e . , that information is accumulated about items in one color subset exclusively . Given our relatively small display size ( eight items ) , and the fact that all items are in view , it is not clear that this assumption can be upheld , and so we put forward a more robust prediction that response times should be proportional to the number of template - matching stimuli . We thank Derrick Watson for bringing this issue to our attention . Running Head : CONFIRMATION BIAS IN VISUAL SEARCH 10 204 Figure 1 .

Panel ( a ) depicts a sample instruction for a block of searches where the 206 target letter is p , and the template color is blue .

All 218 participants provided informed consent . 219 Stimuli 220 Search displays were composed of eight letters , spread evenly along the perimeter of an 221 imaginary circle centred on a fixation cross . Each letter in a search display was a lowercase p , q , 222 b , or d , approximately 2° in height and 1° in width , and was drawn approximately 8° from 223 fixation using Arial font . The letters were always one of four similar letters ( lowercase b’s , p’s , 224 q’s , and d’s ) , chosen to discourage the possibility of target pop - out . Search displays had a dark 225 grey background display . In addition , stimulus colors were selected from a pool of seven 226 possible colors ; purple , yellow , green , orange , pink , blue , and red ( RGB values , respectively : 227 200 , 0 , 255 ; 200 , 200 , 0 ; 0 , 255 , 0 ; 255 , 128 , 0 ; 255 , 128 , 255 ; 50 , 50 , 255 ; 255 , 50 , 50 ) . Before 228 each block of searches , a set of instructions were presented on the screen . 229 Procedure 230 In a given block , one letter was selected as the target letter , and two stimulus colors were 231 selected from the aforementioned pool of eight colors . At the outset of each block , participants 232 were instructed to report whether the chosen target letter was one of the two colors , or not , using 233 one of two keys ( M and Z , on a standard keyboard ) for each response . For example , if the target 234 letter on a given block was p , and the two selected colors were red and blue , the participant may 235 have seen the instruction , “For each search , respond as follows : Press Z if the p is this color 236 ( blue ) , press M if the p is another color . ” The particular response mapping changed from block to 237 block , such that no key was constantly mapped to either type of response . Once participants had 238 Running Head : CONFIRMATION BIAS IN VISUAL SEARCH 12 read and memorized the search rule , they initiated a block of 30 searches by pressing the Enter 239 key . Each participant completed 16 different blocks . 240 For each search , the target letter was always present , accompanied by seven distractor 241 letters . The participant’s task was to determine , for a given display , which of two possible colors 242 the target letter appeared in . Distractor letters were each colored with one of the two colors 243 selected for the block , which we will refer to as the template matching color and template 244 mismatching color , with the former referring to the color explicitly mentioned in the block’s 245 search rule . Two factors were manipulated within search blocks : which color the target was 246 drawn in ( template matching or template mismatching ; each equally likely ) , and the proportion 247 of search stimuli of the template matching color ( 0 . 25 – two of eight letters , 0 . 5 – four of eight 248 letters , and 0 . 75 – six of eight letters ; each equally likely ) . Each block contained an equal 249 number of trials from each condition , and their order was randomized so that participants’ global 250 strategy could be measured . Distractor letters were randomly sampled with replacement from the 251 pool of non - target letters . Search stimuli remained on screen until a response was provided , after 252 which the word “Correct” or “Incorrect” was presented at fixation as feedback . 253 Results and Discussion 254 To determine which strategy was implemented by participants , we conducted a 3 X 2 255 repeated measures ANOVA on median response time ( RT ) for trials with a correct response , 256 with Color Proportion ( 0 . 25 , 0 . 5 , 0 . 75 ) and Match - Color ( template match , template mismatch ) as 257 factors . Unless otherwise noted , all RT analyses include only trials with a correct response . 258 Predicted results for the confirmatory search strategy are a monotonic effect of Color Proportion 259 and a main effect of Match - Color , whereas the minimal search strategy predicted a quadratic 260 ( i . e . , non - monotonic ) effect of Color Proportion and an interaction between Match - Color and 261 Running Head : CONFIRMATION BIAS IN VISUAL SEARCH 13 Color Proportion , as searches should terminate with template matching targets and template 262 mismatching targets , respectively , when the template matching color is in the minority and 263 majority , respectively . Our results ( Figure 2 ) showed that search indeed slowed when 264 proportionally more hypothesis - confirming stimuli were present in the display . Response times 265 increased as the proportion of template - matching colors increased , F ( 2 , 22 ) = 28 . 37 , p < . 001 , 266 partial η 2 = . 72 ; a linear contrast proved statistically reliable , F ( 1 , 11 ) = 47 . 03 , p < . 001 , partial 267 268 Figure 2 . Median Response Times ( left ) and Mean Accuracy ( right ) for the search task in 269 Experiment 1 . Error bars in this and all other figures depict one within - subjects standard error 270 ( Cousineau , 2005 ) . 271 272 η 2 = . 81 , accompanied by a marginally significant quadratic contrast , F ( 1 , 11 ) = 4 . 33¸ p = . 06 , 273 partial η 2 = . 28 . These results show that search time indeed increased as more template - matching 274 colors appeared in the search display , although the increase in search time was not completely 275 linear ( we return to this point in Experiment 3 ) . 276 Responses were also overall slower for template mismatching colors , F ( 1 , 11 ) = 58 . 39 , p 277 < . 001 , partial η 2 = . 84 , and , crucially , this effect did not interact with Color Proportion , F ( 2 , 22 ) 278 Running Head : CONFIRMATION BIAS IN VISUAL SEARCH 14 = 1 . 21 , p = . 32 , partial η 2 = . 10 . Although we observed a quadratic trend of Color Proportion on 279 search time , the lack of an interaction between Color Proportion and Color Match contradicts the 280 possibility that participants adaptively switched search strategies to minimize their searches 281 when the target - mismatching color was the smaller color subset , as in that case , the Color 282 Mismatch trials would now be those where the target matched the updated template , and 283 therefore ought to have exhibited a reduction i n search time . We return to the issue of this 284 quadratic trend in the results section of Experiment 3 . In addition to supporting the confirmatory 285 selection strategy , these results rule out a post - selection strategy , where stimuli are selected 286 randomly and color is only analysed after the target letter is identified . 287 We analysed overall accuracy using a similar repeated measures ANOVA to determine 288 whether results may have been due to a speed - accuracy trade - off . No main effects or interactions 289 were observed , F s < 1 . 75 , p s > . 20 , partial η 2 s < . 14 , ruling out the possibility of a trade - off 290 between speed and accuracy . 291 One possible source of perseveration on selection of the template - matching color is inter - 292 trial priming . Inter - trial priming refers to the facilitation of target selection when one of the 293 targets’ features repeat across sequential trials . Such priming is known to occur when a target’s 294 presence varies ( Olivers & Meeter , 2006 ) , and Experiment 1’s design meets that criterion if we 295 consider template matching and template mismatching targets to be distinct target 296 representations . 297 To assess the possibility that inter - trial priming contributed to confirmatory selection , we 298 divided trials into those that were preceded by a template matching target trial , and those that 299 were preceded by a template mismatching target trial , which we will refer to as the Priming 300 condition . Prime X Match - Color X Color Proportion repeated measures ANOVA revealed a 301 Running Head : CONFIRMATION BIAS IN VISUAL SEARCH 15 main effect of Prime , F ( 1 , 11 ) = 14 . 96 , p = . 003 , but no interactions between Prime and other 302 factors , F s < 1 . 92 , p s > . 17 . It therefore appears that inter - trial priming did not greatly affect 303 selection performance , but that trials requiring falsification of the target template led to a small 304 overall reduction ( M = 59ms , SE = 11ms ) in search time on the subsequent trial . 305 Experiment 2 306 The results of Experiment 1 show a robust effect of confirmatory searching . Overall , 307 search tended to be biased by the target template provided in initial search instructions , despite 308 the fact that both bottom - up saliency and top - down strategy should have encouraged selection of 309 the smaller subset when the template matching stimuli were more numerous . In the present 310 experiment , we sought to determine whether search may have been confirmatory because it is 311 less cognitively demanding to retain a single template across a number of trials ( Shiffrin & 312 Schneider , 1977 ) , rather than switch templates based on the properties of any one search display . 313 To examine this , a new search target template was presented before each search trial in 314 Experiment 2 . This allows us to test the possibility that maintaining a consistent mapping 315 between a given target letter and color as a search template was the source of confirmatory 316 search behavior in the previous experiment . If confirmatory searching occurs due to a resistance 317 to template - switching across trials , then we would expect a minimal search pattern of results ( see 318 Figure 1c ) . However , if confirmatory searching is an automatic consequence of guiding search , 319 then the results of Experiment 2 will mirror those of Experiment 1 . 320 Running Head : CONFIRMATION BIAS IN VISUAL SEARCH 16 Methods 321 Participants 322 Twelve new undergraduate students were recruited for the present experiment . All 323 participants provided informed consent and were compensated with course credit . We chose 324 twelve participants in order to match Experiment 1 for statistical power , and this general 325 approach was also adopted for all subsequent experiments . 326 Stimuli and Procedure 327 The stimuli and procedure for Experiment 2 were identical to those of Experiment 1 , with 328 the exception that participants now completed 300 trials where search displays on every trial 329 were preceded by a new set of search instructions providing a new target template . With this 330 change , the two possible stimulus colors , the target letter , template color , and response mapping 331 were randomized before every trial . 332 Results and Discussion 333 We analysed median response time ( Figure 3 ) and accuracy using separate 3 X 2 repeated 334 measures ANOVAs as in Experiment 1 . Once again , a main effect of Color Proportion was 335 present , F ( 2 , 22 ) = 44 . 04 , p < . 001 , partial η 2 = . 80 . Consistent with confirmatory searching , we 336 observed a significant linear trend , F ( 1 , 11 ) = 59 . 78 , p < . 001 , partial η 2 = . 84 , but no reliable 337 quadratic trend , F ( 1 , 11 ) = 1 . 40 , p = . 26 , partial η 2 = . 11 . In addition , a main effect of Color - 338 Match was again observed , F ( 1 , 11 ) = 49 . 97 , p < . 001 , partial η 2 = . 82 , such that RT was faster 339 when the target matched the template color , and , critically , no interaction was present , F ( 2 , 22 ) = 340 0 . 16 , p = . 85 , partial η 2 = . 02 . These results suggest that template - color matching stimuli were 341 prioritized for search , and that searches terminated upon the detection of a template - color 342 Running Head : CONFIRMATION BIAS IN VISUAL SEARCH 17 matching target . Search template repetition , then , does not appear to be necessary for a 343 confirmatory search strategy to emerge . 344 Unlike Experiment 1 , we observed an accuracy effect in Experiment 2 . Color Proportion 345 did not reliably alter accuracy , F ( 2 , 22 ) = 1 . 21 , p = . 32 , partial η 2 = . 10 , nor did Color Proportion 346 interact with Color - Match , F ( 2 , 22 ) = 0 . 92 , p = . 41 , partial η 2 = . 08 , but Color - Match did , F ( 1 , 347 348 Figure 3 . Median Response Times ( left ) and Mean Accuracy ( right ) for the search task in 349 Experiment 2 . 350 351 11 ) = 5 . 03 , p < . 001 , partial η 2 = . 31 , such that more errors were made in reporting a template 352 mismatching target than in reporting a template matching target . Combined with the RT effects , 353 the overall picture is that template - color mismatching targets were associated with poorer 354 performance in general . 355 Experiment 3 356 The results of Experiment 2 shows that confirmatory selection still occurs when the target 357 template changed from trial to trial , meaning that confirmatory searching does not occur simply 358 as a result of an attempt to minimize cognitive effort . However , memorizing a new target 359 Running Head : CONFIRMATION BIAS IN VISUAL SEARCH 18 template on every trial would certainly tax working memory ; for example , Carlisle and 360 Woodman ( 2011 ) have shown that new search targets are held in visual working memory , but the 361 working memory load decreases as searches continue with the same template . The lack of an 362 optimal selection strategy in Experiments 1 and 2 , then , may have been due to the relatively high 363 working memory load associated with adopting new search targets . In Experiment 3 , we reduced 364 cognitive load by having participants maintain the same search template for the entire 365 experiment . This allowed us to determine whether a flexible selection strategy could be adopted 366 when working memory demands were minimized . We anticipated two possibilities ; that 367 confirmatory searching would again occur , showing that - while not necessary – template 368 repetition could be sufficient to encourage a confirmation bias , or that confirmatory searching 369 would cease , showing that it was the increased cognitive load associated with adopting new 370 target templates that prevented the use of an optimal search strategy . 371 Methods 372 Participants 373 Twelve undergraduate students were recruited for the third experiment . All participants 374 provided informed consent and were compensated with course credit . 375 Stimuli and Procedure 376 We used the same stimuli and procedure as Experiments 1 and 2 , with the exception of 377 the number of trials and blocks , which were changed to 300 and 1 , respectively . As a 378 consequence , each participant received a single pair of stimulus colors , target template 379 instruction , and response mapping that persisted for all searches in the experiment . 380 Running Head : CONFIRMATION BIAS IN VISUAL SEARCH 19 Results and Discussion 381 The results of a 3 X 2 repeated measures ANOVA again showed a main effect of Color 382 Proportion , F ( 2 , 22 ) = 8 . 20 , p = . 002 , partial η 2 = . 43 on search times ( Figure 4 ) . Polynomial 383 contrasts revealed that the effect of Color Proportion was linear , F ( 1 , 11 ) = 11 . 12 , p = . 007 , 384 partial η 2 = . 50 , and not quadratic , F ( 1 , 11 ) = 1 . 06 , p = . 33 , partial η 2 = . 09 . In addition , a main 385 effect of Color Match was also evident , F ( 1 , 11 ) = 7 . 36 , p = . 02 , partial η 2 = . 40 , with no 386 interaction between the two factors , F ( 2 , 22 ) = 0 . 38 , p = . 69 , partial η 2 = . 03 . The results of the 387 388 Figure 4 . Median Response Times ( left ) and Mean Accuracy ( right ) for the search task in 389 Experiment 3 390 391 search time analyses were quite clear : search time was consistently slower when more stimuli 392 matched the target template , and when the target did not match the template . Both of these main 393 effects showed that despite the reduced working memory load in Experiment 3 , confirmatory 394 selection once again occurred . 395 A 3X2 repeated measures ANOVA on accuracy showed no main effects or interactions , 396 F s < 1 . 015 , p s > . 38 , partial η 2 s < . 085 , thus ruling out the possibility of speed - accuracy trade - 397 Running Head : CONFIRMATION BIAS IN VISUAL SEARCH 20 offs . Furthermore , adding reported strategy as a between - subjects factor yielded no reliable 398 interactions with any factors for either RT or accuracy , F s < 0 . 69 , p s > . 52 , partial η 2 s < . 06 , 399 suggesting that explicit search strategies did not substantially alter participant’s searches . 400 Overall , the results of Experiment 3 suggest that repeated search does not reduce the 401 confirmatory nature of visual search . Thus , the results of Experiment 2 cannot be attributed 402 solely to the increased cognitive load of the switching search targets . 403 As can be seen from Figures 3 and 4 , the Color Proportion X RT slopes were more 404 shallow in Experiment 3 than in Experiment 2 ; the average RT cost incurred for each additional 405 template - color matching stimulus in Experiment 2 was 151 ms , whereas in Experiment 3 , this 406 cost was reduced to 56 ms , t ( 11 ) = 2 . 68 , p = . 02 . Experiment 3 , then , shows that experience with 407 a given template increases search efficiency , driven presumably by accumulated priming 408 ( Kristjánsson , Wang , & Nakayama , 2002 ) . Coupled with the results of Experiment 2 , we 409 tentatively suggest that the quadratic trend in Experiment 1 reflects the contribution of 410 economical color selection – that is , selection of the Color Mismatching subset when it is smaller 411 – once sufficient experience has been acquired with a given template . This suggestion may seem 412 paradoxical given that in Experiment 3 , where only one template is ever used , no quadratic trend 413 emerged , but this could reflect the fact that , as guidance is practiced , the costs of switching to the 414 Color Mismatching subset exceed the costs of searching through the larger , Color Matching 415 subset . 416 Experiment 4 417 When the cognitive load of juggling multiple target templates was eliminated in 418 Experiment 3 , confirmatory searching nonetheless persisted . In Experiment 4 , we evaluated the 419 role of search strategy . In our previous experiments , the participants were simply instructed to 420 Running Head : CONFIRMATION BIAS IN VISUAL SEARCH 21 respond to searches as set out in the instructions , and we aimed to observe which strategy they 421 would adopt . Although the strategy evident in the search behavior appeared to be a confirmatory 422 strategy , it is possible that this strategy was adopted because participants did not recognize the 423 other strategies made available by task structure ; namely , that if a target was not observed in a 424 given color set , one could infer that , on that trial , it appeared in the opposite color set . In 425 Experiment 4 , we explicitly told this fact to participants at the outset of the experiment . In 426 addition , participants were informed that the fastest way to complete a search would be to 427 examine the stimuli in the smallest color subset to check for a target letter . We expected that , if 428 confirmatory search was the default , or preferred , strategy , these instructions would not affect 429 search behavior . However , if confirmatory searches were simply an artifact of participants’ lack 430 of familiarity with the task and its idiosyncrasies , these instructions would eliminate 431 confirmatory searching . In the former case , a linear effect of Color Proportion on search time and 432 a main effect of Color Match on search time should again be found . However , if instructions are 433 able to curb the use of confirmatory selection , then a quadratic effect of Color Proportion on 434 search time , and an interaction between Color Proportion and Color Match should be found . 435 Methods 436 Participants 437 Twelve undergraduate students were again recruited for the present experiment . All participants 438 provided informed consent and were compensated with course credit . 439 Stimuli and Procedure 440 The stimuli and procedure for Experiment 4 were identical to those of Experiment 1 . Only the 441 instructions given at the outset were modified . This consisted of the addition of the following 442 sentences : 443 Running Head : CONFIRMATION BIAS IN VISUAL SEARCH 22 “The fastest way to do these searches is to look through whichever colored 444 letters there are fewer of . If you see the target letter , you can respond 445 appropriately , but if you don’t , you will know it must be in the other 446 group , and can make the opposite response . ” 447 Participants were then led through an example where the template mismatching 448 color was in the minority , and told that if the target letter was in that set , they could 449 immediately report the absence of the target - letter in the template - matching color . 450 In addition to verbally describing the strategy , participants were asked to identify 451 the stimulus that would be best to inspect first in the example mentioned above . If 452 the participant indicated that a template mismatching stimulus would be the best to 453 inspect first , this was taken to mean that the participant had understood the strategy . 454 However , if the participant failed to identify the mismatching stimulus , the optimal 455 strategy and illustrative example were reiterated until the participant chose a 456 template mismatching stimulus in the example . 457 Running Head : CONFIRMATION BIAS IN VISUAL SEARCH 23 Results and Discussion 458 Search behavior once again exhibited a confirmatory search pattern . A 3X2 repeated 459 measures ANOVA on search RT ( Figure 5 ) showed a main effect of Color Proportion , F ( 2 , 22 ) = 460 8 . 66 , p = . 002 , partial η 2 = . 44 , which consisted of a linear trend , F ( 1 , 11 ) = 9 . 00 , p = . 012 , 461 partial η 2 = . 45 , and a marginally significant quadratic trend , F ( 1 , 11 ) = 4 . 74 , p = . 052 , partial η 2 462 = . 30 . In addition , a main effect of Color Match was again present , F ( 1 , 11 ) = 35 . 36 , p < . 001 , 463 partial η 2 = . 76 , and Color Match did not interact with Color Proportion , F ( 2 , 22 ) = 1 . 30 , p = . 29 , 464 partial η 2 = . 11 . A 3X2 repeated measures ANOVA on search accuracy showed no main effects 465 or interactions , F s < 0 . 10 , p s > . 91 , partial η 2 s < . 01 . 466 These results of Experiment 4 were qualitatively identical to Experiment 1 , supporting 467 the notion that confirmatory search was not an artifact of a lack of awareness of proper strategy . 468 Although the results suggest that a quadratic relationship between the number of template - color 469 matching stimuli and search time was present , the lack of an interaction between Color Match 470 and Color Proportion again indicates that participants were not consistently switching templates 471 when the template - color matching stimuli outnumbered the template - color matching stimuli . As 472 outlined in the discussion of Experiment 3 , we suggest that this may reflect the contribution of 473 some economical searches , which become possible once the template becomes learned through 474 use . 475 Further supporting the conclusion that explicit strategy did not reduce confirmatory 476 searching is the observation that only five of twelve participants reported using the minimal 477 search strategy when debriefed , despite having been informed of it at the outset . Indeed , reported 478 search strategy did not reliably interact with any factors for either RT , F s < 0 . 63 , p s > . 55 , partial 479 η 2 s < . 06 , or for accuracy , F s < 0 . 71 , p s > . 42 , partial η 2 s < . 07 . 480 Running Head : CONFIRMATION BIAS IN VISUAL SEARCH 24 481 482 Figure 5 . Median Response Times ( left ) and Mean Accuracy ( right ) for the search task in 483 Experiment 4 . 484 485 Given that explicitly instructing participants to use a particular strategy did not affect 486 their search performance , we combined the data from Experiment 1 and 4 , where the procedure 487 had been otherwise identical , to provide a more powerful analysis of the effect of learned 488 strategy on search behavior . Although the cost of reporting template - color mismatching targets 489 was slightly attenuated for those reporting a minimal search strategy , F ( 1 , 22 ) = 4 . 05 , p = . 06 , 490 partial η 2 s < . 16 , as in Experiment 1 , all other interactions were still unreliable for both search 491 time , F s < 1 . 29 , p s > . 29 , partial η 2 s < . 06 , and for accuracy , F s < 2 . 43 , p s > . 13 , partial η 2 s < . 10 . 492 If anything , it seems that a reported minimal search strategy manifests only in a reduced RT and 493 accuracy cost associated with finding the template - color mismatching target . This demonstrates 494 that , at least in this task , search performance and metacognitive strategy are dissociable ; 495 participants appear to know how to complete the task most efficiently , but do not behave in 496 accordance with this approach . 497 Running Head : CONFIRMATION BIAS IN VISUAL SEARCH 25 Experiment 5 498 Thus far , our results have consistently provided evidence for a confirmatory search bias . 499 The effect is largely insensitive to the presence or lack of repetitions of template use , as well as 500 knowledge of the task . In Experiment 5 , we tested whether the confirmatory search bias could be 501 reduced by presenting a preview of the color of search stimuli in advance of the search . Given 502 the robustness of confirmatory selection observed thus far , it is tempting to conclude that 503 confirmatory selection of stimuli matching a template is a relatively automatic process . In 504 previous experiments , participants often did report using a minimal selection strategy , even 505 though their search times told a different story . It may be the case that the strategic guidance of 506 search lags behind the more automatic orienting towards template matching stimuli . An 507 alternative to automatic guidance to template matching stimuli that one could reasonably expect 508 is for automatic orienting to be towards the fewest , and therefore most perceptually salient 509 stimuli . However , at least for our search task , confirmation bias seems to be the default tendency 510 that must be overcome . 511 To test this possibility , we presented a color preview in advance of the search stimuli on 512 every trial . Our reasoning is that , if given the chance to observe the statistics of the colors while 513 not having the ability to begin searching , participants might more appropriately plan their search 514 in advance . If strategic control of selection is simply slower than template - guided selection , we 515 predict a quadratic trend between search time and the proportion of Color Proportion , and an 516 interaction between Color Match and Color Proportion . 517 Running Head : CONFIRMATION BIAS IN VISUAL SEARCH 26 Methods 518 Participants 519 Twelve undergraduate students were recruited for the present experiment . All participants 520 provided informed consent and were compensated with course credit . 521 Stimuli and Procedure 522 The stimuli and procedure were very similar to Experiment 1 ; 16 blocks of 30 trials were 523 again implemented , and a search template was provided prior to each search block , but search 524 stimuli themselves were slightly changed . For each search , a color preview display was 525 presented for 1000 ms in which colored squares , approximately 1 . 2° x 1 . 2º , appeared centered on 526 the positions of their respectively colored search stimuli . After 1000 ms had elapsed , the letters 527 used as search stimuli onset in front of the colored squares . These letters were uniformly colored 528 in white . Instructions were changed accordingly , such that participants were now asked to 529 respond regarding whether the target letter was on a particular color . 530 Running Head : CONFIRMATION BIAS IN VISUAL SEARCH 27 Results and Discussion 531 Preliminary RT analyses showed a number of outlying trials , consisting of both 532 suspiciously long search times ( > 10s , 0 . 013 % of all trials ) , and anticipatory responses ( < 100ms , 533 0 . 06 % of all trials ) . Trials with search times falling outside of either of the aforementioned 534 bounds were excluded before conducting the following analyses . The extended color preview 535 display led to a change in the pattern of search RT ( Figure 6 ) , but this change was also 536 accompanied by changes in search accuracy . A 3X2 repeated measures ANOVA on RT revealed 537 a main effect of Color Proportion , F ( 2 , 22 ) = 17 . 05 , p < . 001 , partial η 2 = . 61 , which was 538 comprised of a linear , F ( 1 , 11 ) = 8 . 70 , p = . 013 , partial η 2 = . 44 , and quadratic , F ( 1 , 11 ) = 46 . 97 , 539 p < . 001 , partial η 2 = . 81 , trend . The effect of Color Proportion was accompanied by a main 540 effect of Color Match , F ( 1 , 11 ) = 15 . 62 , p = . 002 , partial η 2 = . 59 , but no interaction was 541 observed , F ( 2 , 22 ) = 2 . 34 , p = . 12 , partial η 2 = . 18 . 542 The RT data alone is suggestive of a flexible selection strategy , but a repeated measures 543 ANOVA on accuracy revealed speed - accuracy trade - offs . A main effect of Color Match , with 544 template - color matching targets being reported with lower accuracy , approached significance , 545 F ( 1 , 11 ) = 4 . 41 , p = . 06 , partial η 2 = . 29 . In addition , Color Proportion decreased search 546 accuracy , F ( 2 , 2 ) = 13 . 88 , p < . 001 , partial η 2 = . 56 , in a monotonic fashion , F ( 1 , 11 ) = 37 . 38 , p 547 Running Head : CONFIRMATION BIAS IN VISUAL SEARCH 28 548 Figure 6 . Median Response Times ( left ) and Mean Accuracy ( right ) for the search task in 549 Experiment 5 . 550 551 < . 001 , partial η 2 = . 77 , such that search responses were less accurate as more stimuli matched 552 the template color . In addition , Color Match and Color Proportion interacted , F ( 2 , 22 ) = 3 . 71 , p 553 = . 04 , partial η 2 = . 25 , such that the difference in accuracy between Color Match conditions 554 increased as the proportion of template - matching colors increased , F ( 1 , 11 ) = 6 . 71 , p = . 025 , 555 partial η 2 = . 38 , with accuracy suffering most when the target appeared in the template matching 556 color . Combined with the increase in the number of participants reporting a minimal search 557 strategy ( 10 of 12 ) , these results suggest that while participants improved their search speed on 558 trials when the task demands encouraged prioritizing the color not mentioned in the instructions , 559 this also led to more search errors . Participants may have opted to switch templates for these 560 searches , but the increased cognitive load of these switches led to more errors at the response 561 planning stage . 562 To further clarify the effect of color previews on search strategy , we supplemented these 563 analyses by computing efficiency scores ( mean accuracy divided by median response time for 564 Running Head : CONFIRMATION BIAS IN VISUAL SEARCH 29 correct and incorrect trials ) . Efficiency was greatest with 2 of 8 stimuli matching the template 565 color ( M Color Match = 1 . 23 , SE = 0 . 10 ; M Color Mismatch = 1 . 10 , SE = 0 . 09 ) , worst with 4 / 8 matching 566 the template color ( M Color Match = 0 . 79 , SE = 0 . 06 ; M Color Mismatch = 0 . 68 , SE = 0 . 04 ) , and slightly 567 better with 6 / 8 matching the template color ( M Color Match = 0 . 81 , SE = 0 . 08 ; M Color Mismatch = 0 . 88 , 568 SE = 0 . 10 ) . Estimates of efficiency were affected by Color Proportion , F ( 2 , 22 ) = 74 . 95 , p < 569 . 001 , partial η 2 = . 51 , with both linear , F ( 1 , 11 ) = 27 . 31 , p < . 001 , partial η 2 = . 71 , and quadratic , 570 F ( 1 , 11 ) = 40 . 97 , p < . 001 , partial η 2 = . 79 , components . Although Color Match was only 571 marginally significant , F ( 1 , 11 ) = 4 . 23 , p = . 062 , partial η 2 = . 28 , it critically interacted with 572 Color Proportion , F ( 2 , 22 ) = 7 . 98 , p = . 002 , partial η 2 = . 42 . This interaction was such that , when 573 the number of template - matching colors was greater than the number of template - mismatching 574 colors , template - color matching targets were less efficiently detected than template - color 575 mismatching targets , suggesting that participants indeed did adapt their search strategy to the 576 proportion of colors in a search display . However , that this effect was accompanied by a linear 577 effect of Color Proportion suggests that the strategic search strategy coexisted with a 578 confirmatory tendency . Searches where confirmatory searching was strategically optimal were 579 overall more efficient than trials where it was not , as indicated by a pairwise comparison 580 between 25 % template - matching color trials and 75 % template - matching color trials , F ( 1 , 11 ) = 581 27 . 31 , p < . 001 , partial η 2 = . 71 . Nonetheless , the previews did alter the extent of confirmatory 582 searching ; a Mixed Model ANOVA comparing efficiency scores between Experiments 1 and 5 583 showed that Experiment interacted with the effect of Color Proportion , F ( 2 , 44 ) = 15 . 88 , p < 584 . 001 , partial η 2 = . 42 , as well as with the interaction between Color Proportion and Color Match , 585 F ( 2 , 44 ) = 4 . 12 , p = . 023 , partial η 2 = . 16 . Overall , these results show that color preview displays 586 can attenuate confirmatory searching , but not completely . 587 Running Head : CONFIRMATION BIAS IN VISUAL SEARCH 30 General Discussion 588 Across five experiments , we measured visual search performance in a novel task 589 designed to examine the use of confirmatory search strategies . Participants were asked to report 590 whether a target letter was a target color or not , and across searches we varied the proportion of 591 stimuli in search displays that were the target color or non - target color . Despite the fact that this 592 search task allowed participants to adopt a strategy of target disconfirmation – that is , they could 593 examine the stimuli in a non - target color – the target confirmation strategy dominated 594 performance . We conclude , therefore , that a confirmation bias exists even in simple visual search 595 tasks . This conclusion is supported by the conjunction of two general findings ; first , that 596 participants were slower to report the target identity when proportionally more search stimuli 597 matched the target template , as defined in search instructions , even though a more economical 598 selection strategy was available , and second , that participants were faster to report the target 599 identity when the target was the color of the template than when the target was another color . 600 The first finding is reminiscent of studies of subset search ( e . g . , Bacon & Egeth , 1997 ; 601 Sobel & Cave , 2002 ) , where participants perseverate in selecting stimuli possessing a particular 602 guiding feature if instructed , even when this feature is present in the larger of two equally useful 603 search subsets . While subset search research speaks to the strength of instructions in dictating 604 top - down selection , these results cannot , by themselves , demonstrate confirmatory searching , as 605 no other search strategy ( i . e . , disconfirmation of target presence ) is available in these tasks as a 606 viable alternative to confirmatory searching . Similarly , the finding of slower search times for 607 targets not matching the template may be considered to be an instantiation of the classic finding 608 of slower searches for targets defined by the absence of a feature ( Wolfe , 2001 ) . If this 609 comparison is valid , then our results provide a demonstration that feature absence may be 610 Running Head : CONFIRMATION BIAS IN VISUAL SEARCH 31 relative to task set . That is , the particular stimulus that would be considered “feature - present” 611 and “feature - absent” in our task was a consequence of an arbitrary assignment of one of two 612 colors in the search instructions . 613 The results of these experiments converge on the conclusion that the default , or preferred , 614 search strategy is one in which searcher prioritizes stimuli that share features with a target 615 template , and opts to determine the status of a target by matching it to the template rather than by 616 switching to a disconfirmation strategy of searching for stimuli that would provide evidence 617 against the presence of a template - matching target . Our results therefore rule out the possibility 618 that confirmatory searching is task - contingent selection strategy . In our search task , matching 619 search stimuli to a single color - letter conjunction entailed conducting more analysis than strictly 620 necessary to complete a search . However , search times indicated that this is how participants 621 opted to search . It is important to note that , because our data rely only on overall response time , 622 increases in response time caused by increases in the proportion of template - matching stimuli 623 may not simply reflect increases in the total number of stimuli inspected in search , but may also 624 reflect increases in time spent processing the color statistics in the display to plan searches , 625 updating templates , processing individual stimuli , or selecting responses . While additional 626 stimulus manipulations , or within - trial search metrics ( e . g . , eye tracking ) are needed to resolve 627 this uncertainty , from a purely performance based perspective , we may still conclude that visual 628 search is successfully terminated faster when a target’s presence is confirmed , not disconfirmed . 629 Confirmatory search may stem from a number of underlying sources . The first possibility 630 is , as has been suggested before , that visual search can only be guided by one template at a time . 631 A number of studies investigating the control of visual search guidance by representations in 632 visual working memory have demonstrated that only one representation appears to be prioritized 633 Running Head : CONFIRMATION BIAS IN VISUAL SEARCH 32 to guide search at a time ( reviewed in Olivers et al . , 2011 ) . Although contrary findings exist 634 ( Beck , Hollingworth , & Luck , 2013 ; Irons , Folk , & Remington , 2012 ) , a sufficiently 635 sophisticated notion of search templates , such as the Boolean Map Theory of Visual Selection 636 ( BMTVS ) can accommodate guidance by multiple features , but via a single template . In the 637 BMTVS , multiple features may be combined using Boolean ( conjunctive and disjunctive ) 638 operations , with the critical consequence that any stimuli selected using a given Boolean setting 639 cannot be distinguished from each other on the selection dimension ( e . g . , color ) ; further template 640 adjustments would need to be made in order to distinguish these selected stimuli from each other 641 on any a particular dimension . In our selection task , because color is a dimension that is 642 necessary to select the appropriate response , BMTVS predicts that only a single color can be 643 used to guide selection and analysis , because color is necessary for deciding between responses 644 in addition to selecting potential target stimuli . A single template architecture introduces costs 645 associated with updating the target template to the appropriate template for a particular display . 646 The costs associated with calculating and updating to the appropriate template to use may simply 647 outweigh the benefits of updating in terms of overall search time . Thus , capacity limitations in 648 search template guidance from working memory are a potential culprit in the source of 649 confirmatory searching . As suggested earlier , a similar limitation has been suggested in 650 reasoning ( Mynatt , Doherty , & Dragan , 1993 ) , which requires search for information through a 651 possibility space . 652 On the other hand , confirmatory searching in our task may be due to difficulties in 653 guiding search with negative information . In the instructions , we framed the search such that the 654 target could either be one particular color , or not that particular color . While the search 655 performance appears to reflect a confirmatory , template matching stimulus prioritization , it may 656 Running Head : CONFIRMATION BIAS IN VISUAL SEARCH 33 be that search cannot be strategically guided by negative information ( e . g . , “not blue” ) . As noted 657 earlier , search for absent features is well - known to be difficult . If it is the case that our mere 658 framing of the non - template color as the absence of the template color was sufficient to recode 659 the non - template color as an absent feature , this may account for why selection was 660 preferentially guided towards the template color . In this case , the template color would have been 661 treated as a “present” feature , and therefore would lead to easier selection , making the 662 perseveration of selection on this color optimal for participants . While plausible , this account 663 would require an additional interpretation of feature - absent effects : until now , these effects have 664 been taken to reflect a property of the visual system’s coding , as opposed to task demands . The 665 nearest approximation of a cognitive , rather than perceptual , interpretation of feature - absent 666 effects that we are aware of stems from work on familiarity as a feature in visual search ( e . g . , 667 Wang , Cavanagh , & Green , 1994 ; Shen & Reingold , 2001 ) . These studies have shown that 668 stimuli whose low - level visual properties are otherwise identical interact with search efficiency 669 depending on whether they are meaningful stimuli : finding an unfamiliar stimulus ( a rotated 670 letter ) among familiar stimuli ( un - rotated stimuli ) is easier than finding a familiar stimulus 671 amongst many unfamiliar stimuli . If the negative - framing of the search task in our instructions is 672 indeed the reason for confirmatory searching , then we will have incidentally provided a 673 demonstration of the top - down construction of what defines a feature in visual search . 674 Although in this task , participants performed in a way that was not strategically optimal , 675 confirmatory searching is likely a globally optimal strategy for visual search . For falsification to 676 be an economical strategy requires some features or stimuli exist that are negatively correlated 677 with the presence of whatever is being searched for . When target presence and absence is 678 independent of other environmental features , only confirmation of the target’s presence can 679 Running Head : CONFIRMATION BIAS IN VISUAL SEARCH 34 reduce search times compared to an exhaustive search . In light of arguments that visual search 680 may be optimized for foraging ( Klein & MacInnes , 1998 ; Cain , Vul , Clark , & Mitroff , 2012 ) , 681 confirmatory searching would prove beneficial , in that the analysis of the environment would be 682 tailored towards the goal of finding any extant resources , and promote the sustained pursuit of a 683 goal even in situations where positive evidence is scant . Friedrich ( 1993 ) has argued for a related 684 basis of confirmation bias in reasoning , noting that different types of errors produce more or less 685 costs in the context of particular goals , and that it is more pragmatic to minimize costly errors 686 than to simply minimize all errors , irrespective of their consequences . In the context of our visual 687 search , additional covert costs – such as switching templates in working memory – may simply 688 be more costly than the additional time spent searching in those cases where more stimuli match 689 target templates . More broadly , expending cognitive ( and motoric , in the case of saccades ) 690 resources to sustain a purely visual search for signs of prey is a relatively low cost investment , 691 given the potential payoffs . Mechanisms in visual search , therefore , may be tuned to allow 692 perseveration on the possibility that a real resource is indeed present , so that visual inspections 693 can be sufficiently thorough . Cognition in general may be seen as a ( relatively ) biologically 694 cheap way of tuning our actions in advance so as to acquire proportionally greater survival gains . 695 While we have shown that visual search tends to prioritize the confirmation of the 696 presence of a target stimulus , even when suboptimal , it is not yet clear whether the confirmatory 697 tendencies of top - down visual attention are related to confirmation bias as it exists in more 698 cognitively complex social behavior and problem solving . A surface relationship between visual 699 search and reasoning has been suggested by Mercier ( 2012 ) , who noted the utility of using visual 700 search as an analogy for how individuals seek arguments in order to persuade another person . In 701 principle , both vision and reasoning are subject to the problem of combinatorial explosion 702 Running Head : CONFIRMATION BIAS IN VISUAL SEARCH 35 ( Tsotsos , 1995 ; Evans , 2006 ) where the number of possible interpretations of observations 703 exceeds any reasonable estimate of computability . In both cases , selection is necessary in order 704 to arrive at any conclusion , and goal - driven selection is a sensible implementation for motivated 705 agents . Despite the differences in complexities , visual selection and complex cognition may be 706 related on the basis of shared executive processes or working memory , as suggested by Mynatt , 707 Doherty , and colleagues ( 1990 , 1991 , 1993 ) . Indeed , Hills and colleagues ( 2006 ; 2014 ) argue 708 that goal directed cognition may find its evolutionary roots in foraging behavior , and has shown 709 that search styles can be primed across domains – for example , between a visual foraging task 710 and a lexical search task ( Hills , Todd , & Goldstone , 2008 ) – suggesting shared cognitive control 711 mechanisms . Clearly , goal - driven selection is a broad feature of the human mind , and while 712 globally beneficial , it can lead us to flawed beliefs or behaviors when the assumptions borne by 713 particular goal - driven attentional settings are themselves flawed , irrespective of the domain of 714 analysis . Of course , all is not lost ; flawed beliefs and interpretations can be corrected by a 715 sufficient amount of inconsistent evidence . The effect of selection is merely a bias towards 716 certain conclusions , not utter hegemony of beliefs and expectations in the face of all available 717 evidence . Our primary proposal is that the effects of selection on evaluation of information will 718 occur regardless of the domain in question . 719 Conclusions 720 By using a modified visual search task , we measured whether stimuli that could confirm 721 the presence of a target are prioritized over those that could disconfirm the presence of a target . 722 Our results provide support for the notion that top - down attention prioritizes stimuli that match a 723 template , even when this strategy is not optimal for the task at hand . This constitutes a 724 confirmatory search tendency , and given the similarities between features of theories of limits in 725 Running Head : CONFIRMATION BIAS IN VISUAL SEARCH 36 both visual search and reasoning , we take these results as suggesting that mechanisms of top - 726 down , selective attention , to the extent that they are shared across cognitive domains , may 727 contribute to confirmation bias beyond visual search . 728 Running Head : CONFIRMATION BIAS IN VISUAL SEARCH 37 Acknowledgements 729 This research was supported by a Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada 730 Discovery to Jay Pratt ( 194537 ) .
