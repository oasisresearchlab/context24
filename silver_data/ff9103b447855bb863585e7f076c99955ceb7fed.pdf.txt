After the cellular prion protein ( PrP c ) transits to the cell surface where it is bound by a glycophosphatidyl inositol ( GPI ) anchor , PrP c is either metabolized or converted into the scrapie isoform ( Prpsc ) . Because most GPI - anchored proteins are as - sociated with cholesterol - rich membranous microdo - mains , we asked whether such structures participate in the metabolism of PrP c or the formation of PrP sc . The initial degradation of PrP c involves removal of the NH2 terminus of PrP c to produce a 17 - kD polypeptide which was found in a Triton X - 100 insoluble fraction . Both the formation of PrP s ~ and the initial degradation of PrP c were diminished by lovastatin - mediated deple - tion of cellular cholesterol but were insensitive to NI - LCI . Further degradation of the 17 - kD polypeptide did occur within an NI - LCl - sensitive , acidic compart - ment . Replacing the GPI addition signal with the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of mouse CD4 rendered chimeric CD4PrP c soluble in cold Tri - ton X - 100 . Both CD4PrP c and truncated PrP c without the GPI addition signal ( Rogers , M . , E Yehieley , M . Scott , and S . B . Prusiner . 1993 . Proc . Natl . Acad . Sci . USA . 90 : 3182 - 3186 ) were poor substrates for PrP s¢ formation . Thus , it seems likely that both the initial degradation of PrP c to the 17 - kD polypeptide and the formation of PrP s¢ occur within a non - acidic compart - ment bound by cholesterol - rich membranes , possibly glycolipid - rich microdomains , where the metabolic fate of PrP c is determined . The pathway remains to be identified by which the 17 - kD polypeptide and PrP s¢ are transported to an acidic compartment , presumably endosomes , where the 17 - kD polypeptide is hydro - lyzed and limited proteolysis of PrP s ~ produces PrP 27 - 30 . T HV . scrapie prion protein ( prps¢ ) ' is the only known component of the transmissible prion ( Bfieler et al . , 1993 ; Prusiner , 1991 ; Prusiner et al . , 1993 ) and is de - rived from a normal cellular protein ( PrP c ) which is bound to the surface of cells by a glycophosphatidyl inositol ( GPI ) anchor ( Stahlet al . , 1987 ) .

Spectroscopic studies have shown that PrP c contains ~ 40 % c ~ - helix , and is devoid of B - sheet while PrP s ~ has more than 40 % / ~ - sheet ( Pan et al . , 1993 ; Safar et al . , 1993 ) . Upon conversion of PrP c into PrP so , prion protein ( PrP ) molecules acquire new biochem - ical and biophysical properties that can be used as markers for identification . Whereas PrP c is readily soluble in most detergent and is completely degraded by proteases , PrP s ~ is insoluble in detergents , possesses a protease - resistant core termed PrP 27 - 30 ( Meyer et al . , 1986 ) , and po ! ymedzes into amyloid designated prion rods ( Prusiner et al . , 1983 ) . In scrapie - infected cells in culture , two mutually exclusive metabolic fates await plasma membrane prpc : ( 1 ) ~ 5 % of PrP c molecules are converted into PrP s ~ ( Borchelt et al . , 1990 ; Taraboulos et al . , 1990a ) and ( 2 ) > 90 % of PrP c is degraded with a h / 2 = , x , 6 h ( Caughey et al . , 1989 ) . The subeellular sites for these two processes are unknown . The formation of PrP sc is thought to require direct interaction between PrP c and existing PrP s ~ molecules ( Kocisko et al . , 1994 ; Prusiner et al . , 1990 ) . Nascent PrP s¢ is then NH2 - terminally trimmed in an acidic compartment ( Caughey et al . , 1991 ; Taraboulos et al . , 1992 ) and accumulates within © The Rockefeller University Press , 0021 - 9525 / 95 / 04 / 121 / 12 $ 2 . 00 Tbe Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 129 , Number 1 , April 1995 121 - 132 121 secondary lysosomes ( McKinley et al . , 1991 ; Taraboulos et al . , 1990b ) . Uninfected cells do not produce PrP s ~ . Since understanding the metabolism of PrP c is important in the study of prions , we have explored the influence of its GPI anchor on the two alternative metabolic fates described above . GPI moieties are emerging as powerful sorting and targeting signals that direct proteins to specialized domains of the plasma membrane ( PM ) in various cell types . In par - ticular , GPI - anchored proteins seem to be directed to a membrane microenvironment ( Simons and van Meer , 1988 ) that renders them insoluble in cold Triton X - 100 ( Brown and Rose , 1992 ; Cerneus et al . , 1993 ; Cinek and Horejsi , 1992 ; Hooper and Bashir , 1991 ) . Detergent insolubility is acquired in the Golgi apparatus and appears to remain a property of these proteins throughout their lifetime . When this property is lost during turnover processes is unknown . While the exact nature of these Triton X - 100 insoluble membrane domains is unknown , they are thought to be considerably enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids ( Brown and Rose , 1992 ) . Caveolae seem either to constitute a structurally and func - tionally specialized subset of the Triton X - 100 insoluble membrane domains , or to associate closely with them ( An - derson et al . , 1992 ) . In cells possessing caveolae , the folate receptor , PrP c and other GPI - anchored proteins cluster in the vicinity of these PM invaginations ( Ying et al . , 1992 ) . However , the immunoelectron microscopic and the im - munofluorescence data supporting this caveolar clustering have recently been criticized on the ground that antibody cross - linking was responsible for some of this clustering ( Mayor et al . , 1994 ) . Cholesterol is necessary both for the structural integrity of caveolae and their only currently known function , folate potocytosis ( Anderson et al . , 1992 ; Anderson , 1993 ; Chang et al . , 1992 ; Rothberg et al . , 1990b ) . In one study , caveolae were identified on the surface of neuroblastoma ( N2a ) cells and quantitative immunocyto - chemistry of PrP c revealed numerous clusters of gold parti - cles on the surfaces of these cells , 12 % of which were in cav - eolae ( Ying et al . , 1992 ) . In contrast , other investigators failed to identify caveolae in N : a cells ( Shyng et al . , 1994 ) . Because there is disagreement about morphologically defined caveolae in N2a cells , our studies focused on mem - brane microdomains defined operationally by their insolubil - ity in Triton X - 100 ( Brown and Rose , 1992 ) . In addition to measuring the Triton X - 100 insolubility of PrP c and its degradation products , we examined the cholesterol depriva - tion of cells and replacement of the GPI anchor of PrP with a transmembrane sequence . Upon analyzing the turnover of PrP c , we unexpectedly found that degradation occurs in two distinct steps . First , the polypeptide is NH2 - terminally clipped resulting in a 17 - kD polypeptide ( unglycosylated Mr ) similar , or possibly identical , to prpc - II first identified in Syrian hamster ( SHa ) brain ( Haraguchi et al . , 1989 ; Pan et al . , 1992 ) . This degradative step occurs within Triton X - 100 insoluble domains . Second , the 17 - kD fragment was completely degraded within an acidic compartment which is likely to be endosomal . When cells were depleted of choles - terol , PrP c degradation was slowed , and the generation of PrP s ~ molecules was inhibited . Under these conditions , the synthesis of PrP c proceeded normally or was even in - creased . To examine the importance of the GPI anchoring of PrE we replaced the GPI addition signal with the transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions of mouse CD4 ( Littman and Gett - ner , 1987 ) that target proteins to clathrin - coated pits ( Keller et al . , 1992 ) . In contrast to GPI - anchored PrP c , chimeric CD4PrP expressed in ScN : a cells was equally soluble in Triton X - 100 at 4°C and 37°C and was not converted into PrP s ~ . Deletion of the GPI addition signal at the COOH terminus of PrP was previously found to diminish but not abolish PrP h synthesis in scrapie - infected neuroblastoma ( ScN2a ) cells ( Rogers et al . , 1993 ) . In addition , a patient with Creutzfeldt - Jakob disease has been identified who has an amber mutation at codon 145 resulting in the translation of truncated , anchorless PrP molecules some of which formed PrP amyloid plaques ( Kitamoto et al . , 1993 ) . Thus , the GPI anchor seems to be dispensable for the structural changes which occur during the formation of PrP s ~ . The foregoing results suggest that a cholesterol - dependent pathway related to the membrane microenvironment of PrP c is involved in the degradation of PrP c and in the for - mation of PrP s ~ . Materials and Methods Materials Cholesterol standard ( 965 - 25 ) , lipid - cholesterol rich supplements ( L 4848 ) , and mevalonic acid lactone ( M 9627 ) were from Sigma Chem . Co . ( St . Louis , MO ) . Lovastatin ( a generous gift from Merck , Sharp , and Dohme research laboratories , West Point , PA ) was saponified ( Langan and Volpe , 1986 ) before use . 3SSMethionine was from New England Nuclear ( Bos - ton , MA ) . Reduced lipid FBS was first purchased from Sigma Chem . Co . ( F 8895 ) . When this product was discontinued we prepared reduced lipid FBS ( Goldstein et al . , 1983 ) . Reagents for cell culture were purchased from the University of California San Francisco Cell Culture Facility ( San Fran - cisco , CA ) , except the methionlne - free medium and the ( 3418 which were from GIBCO BRL ( Gaithersburg , MD ) . Tunlcamycin and phosphatidyl - inositol - specific phospholipase C ( PIPLC ) ( B . Cereus ) were from Boeh - ringer Mannheim Corp . ( Indianapolis , IN ) . Protein A - Sepharose was from Pharmacia Biotech ( Piscataway , NJ ) . All other chemicals and inhibitors were from Sigma Chem . Co . Cultured Cells N2a cells were obtained from the Amer . Tissue Culture Collection ( Rock - ville , MD ) . ScN2a cells are the persistently infected clone as described ( Butler et al . , 1988 ) . Hamster brain ( HaB ) cells were derived from the cul - ture of a Syrian hamster ( SHa ) brain as described ( Taraboulos et al . , 1990a ) . ScN ~ a - MHM2 expressing the gene PrP - MHM2 were as described ( Scott et al . , 1992 ) . All the cells were grown and maintained at 37 . 5 " C in DME16 supplemented with 10 % FBS , except when specified otherwise . Cells transfected with CIMPrP in the pSPOX vector were grown in the same medium suppiemented with 1 g / ml G418 . Cells for the lovastatin experi - ments were set up according to the following standard format unless other - wise specified : On day zero , (cid:127)1 . 5 × 106 cells were seeded on 6 - cm plates ( Coming Glass Works , Coming , NY ) , and grown for 2 d in regular medium . On day 2 , the medium was replaced by fresh DME supplemented in some cases with 10 % reduced lipid FBS ( Goldstein et al . , 1983 ) and 200 # M mevalonate . When needed , lovastatin was added to 0 . 3 # M on day 2 . On day 5 , the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing identical supplements . The experiments were carried out on day 6 , except when specified otherwise . Antibodies R073 is an antiserum raised in a rabbit against SDS - PAGE purified SHaPrP 2 % 30 which reacts with SHaPrE mouse ( Mo ) PrP , and MHM2PrP ( Serban et al . , 1990 ; Taraboulos et al . , 1990b ) . 3F4 is a mAb raised against SHaPrP 2 % 30 ( Kascsak et al . , 1987 ) , Its epitope , ( Meh09 - Meht2 ) is present on SHa as well as on MHM2PrP , but not on the MoPrP gene ( Rogers et al . , 1992 ) . Thus , the 3F4 mAb does not recognize the wild - type ( wt ) MoPrP in ScN2a ceils but reacts with the products of the chimeric PrP genes MHM2PrP ( Scott et al . , 1992 ) and MHM2 - CD4PrP . The mAb 13A5 was The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 129 , 1995 122 raised against SHaPrP 2 % 30 ( Barry and Prusiner , 1986 ) . Anti Pl , anti P5 , and anti P3 are monospecific rabbit sera raised against the SHaprP peptides 90 - 102 , 142 - 174 , and 220 - 233 , respectively . Metabolic Radiolabeling and Inhibitors Confluent cells growing on 5 - cm plates were rinsed three times with PBS and incubated for 30 rain with methionine free DME16 medium ( MF - DME ) . The medium was then replaced with fresh MF - DME supplemented with 0 . 5 mCi of 35S L - methionine ( New England Nuclear , Boston , MA ) supplemented with 5 % of the appropriate serum as indicated in each experi - ment . At the end of the labeling period , the cells were rinsed twice with ice - cold PBS , and then either lysed and processed for immunoprecipitation or chased in DME plus 10 % FCS for the appropriate length of time . When needed , mevalonate was added throughout the pulse and chase . Inhibitors were added either to the pulse or the chase periods , or both , as necessary . Inhibitors used in the pulse period were also added to the methionine starva - tion period . Tunicamycin ( 5 mg / ml in DMSO ) was freshly prepared for each experi - ment . Lovastatin was solubilized in EtOH , and then saponified with NaOH before its solubilization in water . Mevalonate was dissolved in EtOH at 4 # g / ml and stored at - 20°C . Triton X - IO0 Solubility Assay Assays for solubility in Triton X - 100 were performed on ice in a cold room ( " ~ 4°C ) . Cells growing on 5 - cm plates were rinsed twice with ice - cold PBS , chilled on ice for 15 rain , and then lysed with 1 - ml ice - cold Triton X - 100 lysis buffer ( 1 % Triton X - 100 , 150 mM NaCI , 10 mM Tris - HC1 , pH 7 . 8 ) for 10 mih . The lysates were then split into two equal fractions and trans - ferred to 1 . 5 - ml centrifugation tubes ; one half was incubated at 37°C for 5 rain while the other half was kept on ice . In some cases , aliquots of lysates were incubated with saponin ( to a final concentration of 1 % ) for 10 rain on ice before ultracentrifugation . The lysates were then centrifuged at 30000 rpm ( 39 , 000 g ) for 30 rain in a TLA 100 . 3 rotor ( Beckman Instrs . , Fuller - ton , CA ) at 2°C . The supernatant was then processed for immunoprecipita - tion ( see next section ) after the addition of sodium sarcosinate ( Sarkosyl ) ( 1 % ( vol / vol ) final concentration ) . The pellets of the high speed centrifuga - tion were discarded . We found that prolonged ultracentrifugation was necessary to sediment quantitatively the Triton X - 100 insoluble PrPC ; this contrasts with work of others using different cells and assaying for Triton X - 100 insolubility of different GPI - proteins ( Brown and Rose , 1992 ) . Possible reasons for differ - ences in sedimentation of GPI - proteins in cold Triton X - 100 are discussed in the Results section . Since Triton X - 100 insoluble PrP c could be detected only when the temperature of the lysates was kept under 4°C at all times , it was essential to perform the procedure on ice in the cold room . Cell Lysis and Immunoprecipitation The cells were processed for immunoprecipitation as described elsewhere ( Taraboulos et al . , 1992 ) with some modifications . Cells growing on 5 - cm plates were lysed in cold lysis buffer ( 100 mM NaCI , 10 mM EDTA , 0 . 5 % NP - 40 , 0 . 5 % sodium deoxycholate , 10 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 8 ) ; this lysis was performed at room temperature and the insoluble material was removed by a low - speed centrifugation for 10 s in an Eppendorf centrifuge at room temperature . Sarkosyl , PMSF and the relevant antiserum were added to final concentrations of 1 % , 0 . 1 M , and 1 # l / ml , respectively , for immuno - precipitation of PrP c . For the purification of PrP so , the lysates were digested with proteinase K before guanidine thiocyanate ( GdnSCN ) denatu - ration and methanol precipitation . The methanol pellets were resuspended in 1 ml TNS ( 100 mM NaCI , 1 % Sarkosyl , 10 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 8 ) ; sup - plemented with 0 . 1 mM PMSF for immunoprecipitation . When needed , PrP c was separated from PrP sc by ultracentrifugation be - fore immunoprecipitation . 1 % Sarkosyl and 0 . 1 M PMSF wore added to the lysate that was then centrifuged at 39 , 000 g , 1 h in a Beckman TL - 100 cen - trifuge equipped with a TLA - 100 . 3 rotor to remove Prt se ( Meyer et al . , 1986 ) , and the supernatant was used for immunopurification . The antibody ( Ab ) was then incubated overnight at 4°C . Protein A - Sepharose beads were then added to the lysate for a 1 - h incubation at room temperature , and the inununoadsorbed proteins wore purified by rinsing in TNS buffer . Protein A - Sepharose was used for all the rabbit sera as well as for 3F4 , which binds well protein A . For 13A5 , an additional incubation step with rabbit anti - mouse IgG serum ( Sigma Chem . Co . ) was added before the precipita - tion with protein A . SDS - PAGE and Autoradiography The imrnunopurified proteins were analyzed on 12 % SDS acrylamide gels as previously described ( Laemmli , 1970 ) . Radiolabeled proteins were de - tected by autoradiography on AR X - ray films ( Kodak ) . In some cases , the radioactivity in the gels was quantified using a PhosphorImnger from Mo - lecular Dynamics ( San Diego , CA ) . Cholesterol and Protein Determination Cells were lysed in lysis buffer , and 20 # 1 of the postnuclear supernatant was used for the fluorogenic reaction which measures free cholesterol ( Heider and Boyett , 1978 ) . The system was calibrated using a cholesterol calibration solution from Sigma Chem . Co . Excitation was at 325 nm and emission was monitored between 315 nm and 500 nm . Fluorescence was assayed in a spectrofluorimeter model LS 50 B ( Perkin Elmer Corp . , Nor - walk , CT ) . Total protein content of the cells was determined using the BCA kit from Pierce ( Rockford , IL ) . Recombinant MHM2 - CD4PrP Gene To construct the MHM2 - CD4PrP , the transmembrane and cytoplasmic re - gions of CD4 ( Littman and Gettner , 1987 ) were fused to the MHM2PrP - ( del 231 - 254 ) gene lacking the GPI attachment sequence ( Rogers et al . , 1993 ) . First , PvuI and XhoI restriction sites were introduced in the CIM sequence by PCR using the mismatched primers CD1 ( 5 ' A GGG GTG AAC C . G _ b _ T CQ GTG TTC CTG GCT ) resulting in the mutations Gin3 ~ : ~ Arg and Thr36s ~ Ser , and CD2 ( 5 ' CTC ATC TGA ~ CTC GAG CCA CCT GCA ) ( the mismatched nucleotides are underlined ) . The polymerase chain reaction fragment was then restricted with PvuI and XhoI and ligated into the MHM2PrP ( del 231 - 254 ) , yielding with MHM2 - CIMPrP sequence , which was then introduced into the expression plasmid pSPOX ( Scott et al . , 1992 ) at the unique sites BglII and XhoI . MHM2 - CIMPrP is referred to as CD4PrP throughout this article . N2a and SCNea cells were transfected with pSPOX - CD4PrP using lipofectin ( GIBCO BRL ) used according to the manufacturer ' s instructions , and they were then selected and maintained with 1 mg / ml of G418 . Western Blotting In some cases , PrP sc from cells was concentrated by limited proteolysis followed by ultracentrifugation before Western blot analysis . This permitted the loading of an entire 9 - cm plate - equivalent per lane of the SDS - PAGE , resulting in an increase in the sensitivity of PrP sc detection . One ml of lysis buffer was added to the cells on a 9 - cm plate and the postnuclear supernatant was digested with proteinase K ( 50 # g / ml , 37°C , 1 h ) . Sarkosyl and PMSF were added to final concentrations of 1 % and 0 . 1 raM , respectively , and the samples centrifuged at 57 , 000 g , 1 h , 4°C . The pellets were solubilized in 100 # 1 containing 3 M of GdnSCN and 1 % Sarkosyl ; after incubating the samples at 65°C for 5 h , the GdnSCN was then removed by EtOH precipitation before loading the SDS - PAGE . Immunofluorescence For the immunofluorescent detection of cell surface PrP , cells growing on Permanox slides ( Nunc , Inc . , Naperville , IL ) were incubated with the rele - vant Ab ( 1 : 50 of either antiserum or ascitic fluid ) for 2 h at 4oc in PBS sup - plemented with reduced lipid FBS . For detection of MoPrP endogenous to the N2a cells , we used the rabbit antiserum R073 . For the detection of CD4PrE we used the rnAb 3F4 ( Kascsak et al . , 1987 ) ascitic fluid . After rinsing with ice - cold PBS , the cells were fixed ( 10 % formalin in PBS , 4°C , 30 rain ) , in appropriate cases permeahilized ( 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 , RT , 5 min ) , and incubated for 30 min in 1 % NH + C1 in PBS to quench the alde - hydes . The cells were then blocked in 5 % milk in PBS , incubated with a fluorescein isothiocyanate - labeled anti - rabbit or anti - mouse IgG for 3F4 and R073 , respectively , for 30 min under the same conditions as the primary Ab , rinsed , and finally mounted in propyl gallate ( Giloh and Sedat , 1982 ) . Results Metabolism and Degradation of PrP c The degradation of PrP c and formation of PrP s ~ in ScN2a cells are mutually exclusive fates experienced by plasma membrane PrP c molecules . We first examined the turnover Taraboulos et al . Prion Protein Modification and Degradation 123 of PrP c and its possible association with Triton X - 100 in - soluble microdomains . To dissect the pathway of PrP c deg - radation , we used pulse - chase radiolabeling experiments . ScN2a cells were radiolabeled for 2 h , and then chased for the indicated period of time , and PrP c ( the detergent solu - ble PrP ) was immunoprecipitated with the polyclonal antise - rum R073 and analyzed by SDS - PAGE ( Fig . 1 A ) . The 33 - 35 - kD band was degraded with a t1 / 2 of several hours , as previously described ( Borchelt et al . , 1990 ; Caughey et al . , 1989 ) . when NI - LC1 ( 40 raM ) was added to the pulse and the chase media , a lower ( Mr = 26 - 29 kD ) band appeared E F 3 . 0 2 . 5 2 . 0 I ~ - 10 0 1 2 3 4 5 0 1 2 3 4 5 Time of chase ( h ) Figure 1 . Degradation of PrP c . ( . 4 ) ScN2a cells were radiolabeled for 2 h and chased for 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 10 , or 24 h . ( B ) ScN2a cells were both radiolabeled for 2 h and chased for the same times as in A in the presence of 40 / ~ M NI - hC1 . After lysis , the cells were cen - trifuged at 57 , 000 g for 1 h at 4°C to sediment PrP so . PrP c was immunoprecipitated from the supernatant using the polyclonal R073 antiserum . ( C ) Hail cells were radiolabeled for 1 h in the presence of tunicamycin ( 5 / ~ g / ml ) , and chased for 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , or 5 h . Cellular PrP c was then immunoprecipitated with R073 . The 17 - kD band is marked by an arrow and the 26 - kD band by an arrow - head . ( D ) NI ~ CI ( 40 izM ) was added throughout the pulse and the chase . In the NI - hCl - treated cells , the 17 - kD degradation product ( arrow ) accumulated during longer chases . ( E ) Radioactivity in the PrP bands of HaB cells in C treated with tunicamycin quantified with a Phosphorlmager scanner . ( F ) Radioactivity in the PrP bands of HaB cells in D treated with both tunieamycin and NI - hCI . ( Closed circles ) 26 kD PrP . ( Open circles ) 17 kD PrP . after 2 h of chase ( Fig . 1 B ) . The increase in the 26 - 29 - kD band correlated with the decrease in the 33 - 35 - kD band , suggesting that this lower band is a degradation product sta - bilized by NI - hC1 . To reduce the heterogeneity in the Mr of the PrP bands , which obscured their identity , we used tunicamycin . In both ScN2a cells ( not shown ) and SHa brain cells ( Fig . 1 , C and D ) , unglycosylated PrP c was rapidly degraded to a 17 - kD product ( arrow ) . HaB cells were used in order to take advan - tage of the ot - PrP mAbs and ct - PrP peptide monospecific an - tisera ( Barry et al . , 1988 ; Rogers et al . , 1991 ) in the mapping of this 17 - kD degradation intermediate . HaB cells were ra - diolabeled for I h in the presence of 5 # M tunicamycin and chased for increasing periods of time ranging from 0 to 5 h ( Fig . 1 , C and D ) . Samples were lysed and PrP c immuno - precipitated with R073 antiserum followed by SDS - PAGE . To ensure that all degradation fragments are detected , we ini - tially used the R073 polyclonal antiserum which was raised against PrP 27 - 30 ( Serban et al . , 1990 ) . The radioactivities in each of the PrP bands was quantified by phosphorimaging ( Fig . 1 , E and F ) . Unglycosylated PrP c ( the 25 - kD band , arrowhead ) was rapidly degraded while the 17 - kD product ( arrow ) was degraded more slowly ( Fig . 1 , C and E ) . When NI - LCI was added to both the pulse and chase periods , the 17 - kD polypeptide increased with a concomitant decrease in the 26 - kD band , suggesting a precursor - product relationship between these two PrP forms ( Fig . 1 , D and F ) . That NI - LCI prevented the degradation of the 17 - kD polypeptide is reminiscent of the inhibition by NI - LC1 of the NH2 - terminal digestion of PrP s " to form PrP 27 - 30 ( Taraboulos et al . , 1992 ) . It seems likely that both the degradation of the 17 - kD polypeptide and the production of PrP 27 - 30 occur in an acidic compartment of the endosomal pathway . In ScN2a cells not treated with tunicamycin ( Fig . 1 A ) , the 26 - 29 - kD degradation product probably corresponds to the unglycosylated 17 - kD polypeptide . While NI - LCI pre - vented degradation of the 17 - kD polypeptide , the degrada - tion of full - length PrP c was similar whether or not NI - LCI was present in the cell medium ( Fig . 1 , B and D ) . Scrapie infection did not alter the degradation of PrP c as assessed in studies comparing uninfected N2a and infected ScN2a cells ( not shown ) . To map the 17 - kD fragment , we used a panel of ot - PrP pep - tide monospecific antisera and ot - PrP mAbs directed against SHaPrP ( Fig . 2 A ) . while the full - length 26 - kD band ( Fig . 2 B , arrowhead ) was immunoprecipitated with all the Abs , the 17 - kD degradation intermediate ( arrow ) reacted only with Abs directed against epitopes situated in the COOH - terminal portion of the molecule ( Fig . 2 B ) including epitope P3 at the COOH terminus of the mature protein . These results argue that the 17 - kD product is generated by cleavage between the 3F4 and the 13A5 epitopes , i . e . , between amino acids 111 and 138 of MoPrP or 112 and 139 of SHaPrP , and consists of the COOH - terminal portion of PrP c ( Fig . 2 A ) . A cleavage site in the corresponding region of the chicken PrP has been reported ( Harris et al . , 1993 ) . We conclude that the first step in PrP c degradation involves the hydroly - sis of the , ~ , 90 NH2 - terminal residues which are removed in a NI - LCl - insensitive process . The remaining 17 - kD frag - ment is stabilized by NI - LC1 and its degradation is thus likely to take place in an acidic , presumably endocytic com - partment . These results argue that the 17 - kD polypeptide is The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 129 , 1995 124 Figure 2 . Characterization of the 17 - kD degradative intermediate of PrP c .

The hatched bar denotes the 17 - kD intermediate identified in R ( B ) HaB cells were labeled for 4 h with tunicamycin and NI - hC1 , and PrP c was immunoprecipitated with the following Abs : ~ xP1 ( lane 1 ) , 3F4 ( lane 2 ) , 13A5 ( lane 3 ) , c ~ P5 ( lane 4 ) , and otP3 ( lane 5 ) . The 17 - kD band ( arrow ) reacted with 13A5 , otP5 , and otP3 but not with otP1 and 3F4 , whereas the 26 - kD band ( arrow - head ) reacted with all Abs . the same as or very similar to the NH2 terminally truncated PrP c found in purified fractions from SHa brain which we earlier designated prpc - II ( Haraguchi et al . , 1989 ; Pan et al . , 1992 ) . NH2 - Terminal Degradation of PrP c Occurs within Triton X - IO0 Insoluble Domains The removal of the NH2 terminus of PrP c is an important metabolic event since it probably renders PrP c ineligible for conversion to PrP s ~ . To characterize the subcellular site of this proteolytic process , we analyzed the solubility of both the precursor and product after treatment with Triton X - 100 . ScN2a cells treated with NILC1 ( 40 / zM ) were radiolabeled for 2 h , and then either harvested immediately ( Fig . 3 A , lanes 1 - 4 ) or chased in unlabeled medium ( lanes 5 - 8 ) . The cells were lysed in 1 % Triton X - 100 either at 4°C ( lanes 1 , 2 , 5 , and 6 ) or at 370C ( lanes 3 , 4 , 7 , and 8 ) and centrifuged at 39000 g for 1 h at 2°C . PrP was immunoprecipitated from the supernatant using R073 antiserum . Both full - length PrP c and the 17 - kD degradation intermediate displayed similar differential solubility in Triton X - 100 suggesting a similar membrane microenvironment for both these PrP spe - cies . To determine if similar results would hold for the un - glycosylated PrP c , we radiolabeled ScN2a cells for 1 h in the presence of tunicamycin ( Fig . 3 B ) , and then chased them l ~ gure 3 . PrP c degradation occurs within cholesterol - rich rafts . ( A ) ScN2a cells were radiolabeled for 2 h . In lanes 5 - 8 , the cells were then chased in unlabeled medium for an additional 18 h . NtGCl ( 40 / ~ M ) was present during the pulse and the chase period . The cells were then lysed in 1 % Triton X - 100 at either 4°C ( lanes 1 , 2 , 5 , and 6 ) or 37°C ( lanes 3 , 4 , 7 , and 8 ) . The lysates were centrifuged at 39 , 000 g for 1 h at either 2 * ( 2 ( cells lysed at 4°C ) or at 25°C ( cells lysed at 37°C ) . PrP was immunoprecipitated from the supematant using R073 antiserum . ( B ) ScN2a cells were radiolabeled for 1 h in the presence of tunicamycin ( 20 tiM ) and chased for 0 , 1 , 2 , or 3 h . ( lanes 1 and 2 , 3 and 4 , 3 and 6 , and 7 and 8 , respectively . ) NI - hC1 ( 40 / , M ) was included during both the pulse and the chase periods . The cells were lysed in 1 % Triton X - 100 either at 4°C ( odd - numbered lanes ) or at 37° ( 2 ( even - num - bered lanes ) , centrifuged and analyzed as described for panel A . for increasing periods of times ranging from 0 to 3 h . The cells were then extracted with 1 % Triton X - 100 at either 4°C or 37°C , spun as before , and PrP c was immunoprecipitated from the supernatant . Both the 26 - kD band ( arrowhead ) and the 17 - kD band ( arrow ) were almost insoluble at 370C sug - gesting their association with cholesterol - rich complexes . Using PIPLC , we also found that the degradation intermedi - ate is GPI linked to membranes ( data not shown ) . The initial step in PrP c degradation appears to take place within a Triton X - 100 insoluble , presumably cholesterol - rich microenvironment . Whether PrP s ~ is also formed within a similar environment remains to be established . Sedimen - tation in cold Triton X - 100 cannot be used to appraise the association of PrP s ~ with these microdomains , because PrP sc is insoluble in non - denaturing detergents ( Meyer et al . , 1986 ) . Lovastatin Diminishes PrP c Degradation To investigate the influence of cholesterol depletion on PrP c degradation , we compared N2a and ScN2a cells treated ei - ther with or without 0 . 3 ~ M lovastatin for 4 d ( Fig . 4 ) . The cells were radiolabeled for 1 h in the presence of tunicamycin ( 20 ftM ) , and PrP c was immunopurified after increasing Tarabou | os el al . Prion Protein Modification and Degradation 125 Figure 4 . Slowed degradation of PrP c for lovastatin - treated cells . ( A ) N2a and ( B ) ScN2a ceils grown in reduced lipid medium with - out ( odd - numbered lanes ) or with lovastatin ( 0 . 3 # M ) ( even - numbered lanes ) were pulse radiolabeled for 1 h in the presence of tunicarnycin ( 20 # g / ml ) , and then chased for 0 ( lanes I and 2 ) , 1 h ( lanes 3 and 4 ) , 2 h ( lanes 5 and 6 ) , 3 h ( lanes 7 and 8 ) , or 4 h ( lanes 9 and 10 ) . PrP c was then immunoprecipitated and analyzed by SDS - PAGE . periods of chase ranging from 0 to 4 h and analyzed by SDS - PAGE . The rate of PrP c degradation was reduced in the lovastatin - treated cells . Whether decreased degradation of PrP c is a consequence of disrupting cholesterol - rich do - mains on the plasma membrane or results from a delayed ex - port of PrP c to the cell surface remains to be determined . Lovastatin Reduces PrP sc Synthesis Since lovastatin diminished the degradation of PrP c , we de - termined whether depriving cells from cholesterol interfaces with the synthesis of prps % ScN2a cells were plated at low density ( ca . 5 x 1 @ cells per 5 - cm dish ) in DME16 sup - plemented with lipid deficient FBS . Lovastatin was added at concentrations of 0 . 1 , 0 . 3 , 1 , or 3 / ~ M to inhibit cellular sterols synthesis ; with the two highest lovastatin concentra - tions , cytopathology was considerable after 5 d . Cells were lysed and PrP s ~ analyzed by Western immunoblotting of proteinase K digested lysates . PrP s ~ content decreased with increasing lovastatin concentration ( not shown ) . A concen - tration of 0 . 3 # M lovastatin was chosen for subsequent ex - periments because it reduced the amount of PrP s ~ while be - ing only minimally cytopathic . To explore the effect of cholesterol , depletion on PrP s ~ , we incubated ScN2a cells for 4 d in a variety of conditions : normal FBS ( Fig . 5 , lane 1 ) , normal FBS and 0 . 3 # M Figure 5 . Lovastatin reduces PrP s ~ synthesis in ScN2a cells . ( Lanes 1 - 5 [ Immunoblots ] ) ScN2a ceils were grown for 4 d with normal FBS ( lane 1 ) , normal FBS and 0 . 3 # M lovastatin ( lane 2 ) , reduced fat FBS and 0 . 3 # M lovastatin ( lane 3 ) , reduced fat FBS ( lane 4 ) , or reduced fat FBS and 0 . 3 # M lovastatin supplemented with 2 . 5 # g / ml cholesterol ( lane 5 ) . They were then lysed , sub - jected to proteolysis catalyzed by proteinase K ( 50 # g / ml , 1 h , 37°C ) , and analyzed by SDS - PAGE . Western immunoblots were probed with the polyclonal Ab R073 . PrP s ~ was reduced in cells treated with lovastatin in reduced fat serum when no exogenous cholesterol was added . ( Lanes 6 - - 8 [ Autoradiographs ] ) PrP c in ScN : a cells were grown for 4 d with reduced fat serum . In lane 6 , no other chemical was added , whereas the cells in lane 7were sup - plemented with lovastatin ( 0 . 3 ttM ) , and in lane 8 both lovastatin ( 0 . 3 # M ) and cholesterol ( 2 . 5 # g / ml ) were added to the medium . The ceils were then metabolically radiolabeled for 2 h , lysed , im - munoprecipitated with R073 , and analyzed by SDS - PAGE . lovastatin ( lane 2 ) , reduced lipid FBS and 0 . 3 / ~ M lovastatin ( lane 3 ) , reduced lipid FBS and lovastatin with the addition of cholesterol ( 2 . 5 # g / ml , lane 4 ) and reduced lipid FBS ( lane 5 ) . Mevalonate ( 200 # M ) was included in the medium of all samples to provide for non - sterol pathways , such as protein isoprenylation . Western immunoblots showed that protease - resistant PrP s ~ was reduced in cells treated with lovastatin in the presence of reduced fat FBS ( Fig . 5 , lane 3 ) in which cellular free cholesterol was reduced by 30 % . Ad - dition of cholesterol throughout the lovastatin treatment prevented the decrease in PrP s ~ ( Fig . 5 , lane 4 ) , arguing that the inhibition of PrP s ~ was caused by the depletion in cholesterol rather than in other mevalonate metabolites . The synthesis of PrP s ~ in lovastatin - treated cells was also studied in pulse - chase metabolic radiolabeling experiments , in which cells were labeled for 2 h and chased for 7 h before PrP s ~ analysis ( data not shown ) . These experiments also showed that PrP s ~ synthesis was reduced in lovastatin - treated cells . In contrast , Pr ~ synthesis was unaltered by lovastatin ( Fig . 5 , lanes 6 - 8 ) . ScN2a cells were grown for 4 d under conditions similar to those described above for the immunoblotting experiments and radiolabeled for 2 h with [ 3sS ] methionine . After lysis , PrP immunopurified before SDS - PAGE and autoradiography ( Fig . 5 , lanes 6 - 8 ) . Since no detectable radiolabeled PrP s ~ is produced in ScN2a cells within this time frame ( Borchelt et al . , 1990 , 1992 ) , we did not separate radiolabeled PrP c from unlabeled PrP s ~ . In - terestingly , not only did PrP c not decrease , but it often in - creased in cells treated with lovastatin and low - fat serum , as The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 129 , 1995 126 compared to cells incubated with low - fat serum alone . In contrast , less PrP c could be released by PIPLC from the surface of the lovastatin - treated ceils , suggesting that PrP c might not be available for conversion into PrP s¢ in choles - terol - depleted cells ( data not shown ) . Whether this is due to the inaccessibility of cell surface PrP c to PIPLC , to a re - duced export of the protein to the plasma membrane , or to the increased partition of PrP c into internal recycling com - partments in cholesterol - deprived cells remains to be deter - mined . Delays in export of PrP c to the plasma membrane could result in decreased PrP sc formation , since it was shown earlier with PIPLC - releasable PrP c is the precursor to PrP s ~ in ScNza cells ( Borchelt et al . , 1992 ; Caughey and Raymond , 1991 ) . In contrast to these results with PrP c , the pool of intracellular folate receptor was diminished , rather than increased , in lovastatin - treated MA104 cells ( Chang et al . , 1992 ) . Transmerabrane Anchorage Inhibits PrP sc Formation To appreciate better the role of the cholesterol - rich microdo - mains in the metabolism of GPI - anchored PrP c , we sought to uncouple PrP c from this microenvironment by replac - ing the GPI anchor by a transmembrane fragment . Data from a previous study suggested that the GPI anchor is dis - pensable for the structural changes that occur in PrP s ~ for - Figure 6 . Expression of CD4PrP in ScN2a cells . ( . 4 ) Map of the MHM2PrP and CD4PrP constructs . ( Full bar ) GPI attachment se - quence . ( Hatched bar ) Transmembrane and cytoplasmic sequences from MoCIM . ( B ) ScN2a cells ( lanes 1 , 3 , 5 , and 6 ) and ScN2a cells transfected with the CIMPrP construct ( lanes 2 , 4 , 6 , and 8 ) were analyzed for PrP c 0anes 1 and 2 ) and PrP s¢ ( lanes 3 - 8 ) by Western immunoblotting using R073 ( lanes 1 , 3 , 5 , and 6 ) or 3F4 ( lanes 2 , 4 , 7 , and 8 ) . In lanes 5 - 8 , PrP s ~ was concentrated as fol - lows : 1 ml lysates from a 9 - cm plate were subjected to proteolysis ( 20 # g / ml proteinase K , 37°C , 1 h ) followed by a high - speed spin to purify PrP s¢ , and a whole plate equivalent was loaded in each lane . 20 # 1 of the lysates were centrifuged ( 57 , 000 g , 1 h , 4°C ) to separate PrP c from prps ~ ; supernatants were loaded on lanes 1 and 2 and pellets loaded on lanes 3 and 4 . ScN2a ceils transfected with CD4PrP did not synthesize appreciable amounts of CD4 - PrP s¢ ( lanes 4 and 8 ) . mation ( Rogers et al . , 1993 ) ; we constructed a hybrid PrP gene in which the GPI attachment signal was replaced with the putative transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions of mouse CIM ( Fig . 6 A ) ( Littman and Gettner , 1987 ) . Proteins anchored through this CD4 fragment cluster on clathrin - coated pits rather than on uncoated regions of the plasma membrane ( Keller et ai . , 1992 ) . To construct the hybrid PrP , we employed the chimeric MHM2PrP gene ( Scott et al . , 1992 ) which carries a SHa - specific PrP epitope recognized by the 3F4 mAb ( Kascsak et al . , 1987 ) ( Fig . 6 A ) . This con - struction permitted us to discriminate the CD4MHM2PrP from the endogenous MoPrP in ScN2a cells . Introduction of the 3F4 mAb epitope ( Metl08 - MetiH ) did not prevent PrP s ~ formation when introduced into the GPI - anchored MoPrP ( Rogers et al . , 1991 ; Scott et al . , 1992 ) . We transfected ScN2a cells with the recombinant CD4 - PrP gene and used an uncloned cell population in the subse - quent experiments , which was selected by an addition of G418 to the cultures . Western immunoblotting developed with 3F4 confirmed that transfected ScN2a cells synthesized CIMPrP c ( Fig . 6 B , lane 2 ) . As expected , the Mr of this CD4PrP c was slightly larger than that of GPI - anchored wtPrP ( lane 1 ) . To determine whether CD4PrP can be con - verted into PrP s ~ , the CD4PrP construct was transfected into ScN2a ceils ( lanes 3 - 8 ) . No 3F4 reacting PrP s ~ signal could be detected in transfected ScN2a cells ( lane 4 ) while the control ScN2a cells were positive with the polyclonal Ab R073 , which recognizes wtPrP ( lane 3 ) . To increase the sensitivity of PrP s ~ detection in cell lysates , we concen - trated PrP s ~ ~ 50 - fold by proteolysis followed by ultracen - trifugation . In the transfected cells lane , only a very faint protease - resistant signal could be detected with 3F4 , even when the lysate from an entire 9 - cm dish was loaded onto a single lane ( Fig . 6 , lane 8 ) . This signal was specific for the 3F4 epitope since a lysate from untransfected ScN2a cells yielded no immunoreactive band with this Ab ( lane 7 ) . Since our assay is based on the host cells being persistently in - fected , thereby providing endogenous prions necessary for the synthesis of PrP so , we used the polyclonal antiserum R073 to confirm that these ScN2a cells were still synthesiz - ing MoPrP s ~ at the same level as the original ScN2a popula - tion ( lanes 5 and 6 ) . We also compared the internalization patterns of GPI - anchored wtPrP and CD4PrP ( Fig . 7 ) . ScN2a cells were la - beled at 4°C with R073 Abs or 3F4 mAbs , and then chased for 45 min at either 4 or 37°C . After fixing and permeabiliz - ing the cells , the pattern of PrP Ab internalization was exam - ined by immunofluorescence ( Fig . 7 B ) . After the 37°C chase , GPI - anchored wtPrP either remained on the cell surface or was internalized to a compartment near the surface ; whereas , CD4PrP was internalized to the perinu - clear region . Thus , CIMPrP c seems to differ from its GPI - anchored counterpart both by its plasma membrane distribu - tion and by its internalization pattern ( Keller et al . , 1992 ) . CD4PrP c Is Soluble in Cold Triton X - IO0 The purpose of the chimeric CD4PrP was to remove PrP from the cholesterol - rich , Triton X - 100 insoluble microen - vironment with which GPI anchored PrP c associates . We employed Triton X - 100 solubility to ascertain that the chi - meric protein was indeed not associated with these microdo - mains ( Brown and Rose , 1992 ; Cerneus et al . , 1993 ) . First , Taraboulos et al . Prion Protein Modification and Degradation 127 Figure 7 . Contrasting localization and internalization of GPI - and CDgl - anchored PrP . ScN2a cells were incubated at 4°C with R073 antiserum ( , 4 and B ) and ScN2a cells expressing CD4HM2 - PrP with 3F4 mAb ( C and D ) , and then chased for 45 min at 4°C ( A and C ) or 370C ( B and D ) . The cells were then fixed , permeabilized , and the PrP Abs revealed by immunofluorescence . While GPI - anchored PrP c either remained on the plasma membrane or was internal - ized within a shallow compartment , the CD4PrP accumulated in the perinuclear region . we verified that the solubility of GPI - linked wtPrP c in Tri - ton X - 100 is temperature - dependent . ScN2a cells were ra - diolabeled for 2 h , and then lysed in 1 % Triton X - 100 at ei - ther 4°C ( Fig . 8 , lane 1 ) or 370C ( lane 2 ) or at 4°C in 1 % Triton X - 100 supplemented with 1 % saponin ( lane 3 ) . The lysates were centrifuged at 39 , 000 g for 30 min at either 4°C or 25°C and the supernatants were analyzed by immunopre - cipitation and SDS - PAGE . As expected , PrP c was relatively insoluble in Triton X - 100 at 4°C , and saponin increased its solubility arguing that PrP c is bound to cholesterol - rich domains ( Cerneus et al . , 1993 ) . In contrast to the GPI - anchored PrP c , CD4PrP c was solubilized equally well at 4°C and at 37°C ( lanes 4 and 5 ) , confirming that the re - combinant protein is not associated with cholesterol - rich complexes . We found that ultracentrifugation at 39 , 000 g for 30 min was essential to detect the differential insolubility of PrP c in cold Triton X - 100 . These sedimentation conditions are more extreme than those used for MDCK cells and suggest that the cholesterol and glycolipid rich microdomains de - rived from N2a cells are either smaller or more buoyant than those from MDCK cells ( Brown and Rose , 1992 ) . Because earlier studies showed that the formation of PrP s ~ is inhibited by brefeldin A ( BFA ) ( Taraboulos et al . , 1992 ) , we examined the effect of BFA on the compartmental - ization of PrP c . When ScN2a cells were radiolabeled in the presence of BFA ( 5 # g / ml ) , PrP c solubility was found to be similar at 4°C and at 370C . These results and the finding that the solubilization of PrP c was unaltered by saponin ( Fig . 8 , lanes 6 - 8 ) , suggest that nascent PrP c molecules synthe - sized in the presence of BFA did not associate to the choles - terol - rich environment . Therefore , as in the case of the CD4PrP chimera , we observed a correlation between associ - ation of PrP c with Triton X - 100 insoluble membrane do - mains , and the ability of this PrP c to be converted into prps ~ . Discussion In cells infected with prions , PrP c has two different meta - The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 129 , 1995 128 Figure 8 . Contrasting solubil - ity of wtPrP and CIMPrP in Triton X - 100 . Untransfected ScNza cells ( lanes 1 - 3 , 6 - 8 ) and ScN2a ceils transfeeted with the CD4PrP gene ( lanes 4 - 5 ) were radiolabeled for 2 h , and then lysed in 1 % Triton X - 100 either at 37 " C ( lanes 2 , 5 , and 6 ) or at 4°C ( lanes 1 , 4 , and 7 ) , or at 4 " C in 1 % Triton X - 100 + 1 % saponin ( lanes 3 and 8 ) . In lanes 6 - - 8 , BFA ( 5 / ~ g / ml ) was included in the labeling me - dium . The lysates were centri - fuged ( 39 , 000 g , 30 mill ) , and PrP was immunopurified from the supernatants with either R073 ( lanes 1 - 3 , 6 - 8 ) or 3F4 ( lanes 4 and 5 ) . wtMoPrP was almost insoluble in Triton X - 100 at 4°C ( lane 1 ) while CD4PrP was as soluble at 4°C as it was at 37°C . bolic fates which are mutually exclusive . A minority of PrP c molecules undergoes a conformational change to be - come PrP s ~ while most of the PrP c is degraded through a pathway which is indistinguishable from that found in unin - fected cells . Our results suggest that both metabolic fates in - volve events mediated by membranes which are rich in cho - lesterol . Multiple lines of experimentation point to relationship be - tween cholesterol - dependent pathways and the metabolism of PrP , First , PrP s ~ synthesis was substantially reduced in cells treated with lovastatin while PrP c levels were un - changed or increased . Since addition of cholesterol together with lovastatin prevented inhibition of PrP s ~ synthesis , we surmise that lovastatin exerted its effect through depletion of other mevalonate metabolites . While mevalonate is an ob - ligate precursor for all isoprenoids , studies have shown that sterols are far more sensitive to reduced mevalonate concen - tration . To provide for non - sterol isoprenoid synthesis , we added 200 / ~ M mevalonate to all lovastatin - treated cells in our experiments . Second , replacing the GPI anchor of PrP with the CIM transmembrane domain targeted it to clathrin - coated pits and reduced the conversion of PrP c into PrP so . Since truncated PrP c lacking the GPI anchor addition sig - nal can be converted into PrP s ~ but at a diminished level ( Kitamoto et al . , 1993 ; Rogers et al . , 1993 ) , we surmise that the failure of CIMPrP c to be transformed into CD4PrP s ~ is likely to result from its targeting to clathrin - coated pits instead of cholesterol - rich membrane domains . It will be important to examine additional amino acid sequences which are known to target proteins to clathrin - coated pits in order to determine whether it is the targeting or altered conformation that prevents PrP s ~ formation , Third , tem - perature - dependent solubility in Triton X - 100 confirmed the association of GPI - anchored PrP c with cholesterol - and glycolipid - rich complexes , in contrast to CD4PrP c . Since the degradation intermediate of PrP c was also GPI an - chored to these complexes , as judged by its differential solu - bility in Triton X - 100 and its releasability with PIPLC , it ap - pears that the first step in PrP c degradation takes place within these cholesterol - rich complexes . Fourth , PrP c deg - radation was diminished in cells deprived of cholesterol . Fifth , that cholesterol - rich complexes are involved in PrP s ~ synthesis is suggested by the finding that BFA , known to in - hibit PrP s ~ formation in ScN2a cells ( Taraboulos et al . , 1992 ) , prevented the association of PrP c with detergent - insoluble complexes . The failure of PrP c to associate with cholesterol - rich domains may provide a mechanism to ac - count for the inhibition of PrP s " formation by BFA . PrP c Degradation Studies of the turnover of PrP c are of considerable impor - tance with respect to prion diseases since diminished expres - sion in gene targeted mice prolongs incubation times ( Biieler et al . , 1993 ; Prusiner et al . , 1993 ) while overexpression shortens them ( Carlson et al . , 1994 ; Prusiner et al . , 1990 ) . In older mice overexpression of wtPrP transgenes produced spongiform degeneration of the CNS , a necrotizing myopa - thy of skeletal muscle , a demyelinating peripheral neuropa - thy and spontaneous formation of prion infectivity ( Westa - way et al . , 1994 ) . Results from cell culture studies are consistent with earlier investigations which identified an NH2 - terminaUy truncated molecule labeled prpc - II in ex - tracts and partially purified fractions from the brains of Syrian hamsters ( Haraguchi et al . , 1989 ; Pan et al . , 1992 ) . SHaPrpc - H was thought to be generated by enzymatic cleavage of PrP c at a site specific for a protease with the specificity of chymotrypsin . For MoPrpc - A present in N2a cells ( Borchelt et al . , 1992 ; Westaway et al . , 1987 ) , the most likely cleavage point for a protease with chymotrypsin - like activity is Tyrt2s since chymotrypsin cleaves preferentially on the carboxyl site of Tyr , Trp , or Phe . Tyro28 is conserved in all known species studied , to date ( Gabriel et al . , 1992 ) . It is interesting to note that in the chicken PrP sequence , the substitution of Phe in position 109 ( numbered according to SHaPrP ) ( Harris et al . , 1991 ) provides an additional cleav - age site for chymotrypsin - like proteases in this region , and that cleavage at this site has been reported in N ~ a cells transfected with chicken PrP ( Harris et al . , 1993 ) . These findings taken together argue that it is likely that a chymo - tryptic protease initiates the degradation of PrP c by excis - ing a ~ 9 - kD fragment from the NH2 - terminus of PrP c resulting in the formation of prpc - II . Although the first degradation step of PrP c seems to occur within detergent insoluble membrane complexes , Taraboulos et al . Prion Protein Modification and Degradation 129 whether it takes place on the plasma membrane or requires internalization remains to be determined . At present , it is unknown whether proteases specific for cholesterol - dependent pathways participate in PrP c degradation . Sev - erai GPI - anchored peptidases have been described ( Deddish et al . , 1990 ; Hooper et al . , 1990 ) . The presence of these peptidases in rafts suggests that other proteases , such as a putative prpc - cleaving enzyme , may also be present in these membrane domains . Since CD4PrP c is not GPI an - chored , it seems likely that the degradation of this protein will differ from that of wtPrP c . Several studies have shown that GPI - anchored molecules are endocytosed through different pathways than their transmembrane counterparts ( Keller et ai . , 1992 ; Yanagishita , 1992 ) . Whether prpc - II can be converted into a truncated form of PrP s " is unknown , prpc - II appears to lack the first puta - tive or - helical domain ( H1 , codons 109 - 122 ) which is likely to be necessary for PrP s ~ formation ( Gasset et ai . , 1992 ) . Of note are two familial prion diseases where the patients ac - cumulated truncated PrP s ~ molecules within PrP amyloid plaques but in each case these proteins contained the H1 re - gion ( Kitamoto et al . , 1993 ; Tagliavini et ai . , 1991 ) . A trun - cated PrP gene was constructed in which the signal peptide ( codons 1 - 22 ) was fused to codons 90 - 254 to produce a pro - tein similar in length to PrP 27 - 30 which contains HI . In ScN2a cells this truncated PrP did acquire the protease re - sistance which is a hallmark of PrP s ~ ( Rogers et ai . , 1993 ) . Studies are in progress to determine if a molecule the size of prpc - II can acquire protease resistance in cultured cells and support scrapie infectivity in transgenic mice . Do Cholesterol - Rich Domains Play a Role in the Formation of PrPsc ? The formation of PrP s ~ is a posttranslational process in which PrP s ~ combines with PrP c to form a transient com - plex ( Prusiner et al . , 1990 ; Scott et al . , 1993 ) . The conver - sion of PrP c into PrP s ~ involves a profound conformational change where the primary event seems to be the acquisition of a structure rich in B - sheet ( Pan et al . , 1993 ) . PrP s ~ ap - pears to serve as a " template " for the conversion of PrP c which may explain , at least in part , the apparent diversity of prions which has often been referred to as " strains . " Whether each strain represents a distinct conformer of PrP s ~ which exhibits a particular incubation time and pattern of PrP s ~ deposition in a specific host remains to be established ( Carl - son et al . , 1994 ; DeArmond et al . , 1993 ; Prusiner , 1991 ) . Our results argue that PrP s ~ formation occurs in cholesterol - rich , detergent - insoluble domains that contain GPI - anchored PrP c . The insolubility of PrP s ~ in nondenaturing detergents such as Triton X - 100 ( Meyer et al . , 1986 ) has precluded demonstrating attachment of PrP s ~ in these cholesterol - rich , detergent - insoluble domains . The presumed transient nature of the prpc / prP s ~ complexes may also make detec - tion of PrP s ~ in this compartment difficult . While immuno - electron microscopy has localized PrP s ~ primarily to lyso - somes in cultured cells , we cannot rule out the possibility of small amounts of PrP s ~ in other compartments ( McKinley et al . , 1991 ) . Whether or not cholesterol - rich membrane domains pro - mote the formation of PrP s ~ by concentrating PrP c to high surface density remains to be established . Caveolar GPI - anchored folate receptor is very densely packed : 30 , 000 molecules / / ~ m 2 in MA104 cells ( Rothberg et ai . , 1990a ) . If cholesterol - rich domains were to concentrate GPI - anchored PrP c either on the plasma membrane or in other sites , they could provide a propitious environment for the formation of PrP s ~ . Alternatively , cholesterol - rich domains might func - tion by targeting PrP c to other compartments where PrP s ~ is formed . Of note , an extensive caveolar recycling of cholesterol - rich domains from the PM to the TGN is likely to exist , since transport of the influenza HA to the PM pro - ceeds in MDCK cells even when the viral infection halts the synthesis of endogenous proteins ( Wandinger - Ness et al . , 1990 ) . In the case of the folate receptor , caveolae are en - gaged in the recycling of this GPI - anchored protein before becoming acidified ( Anderson et al . , 1992 ) . It is interest - ing to note that PrP s ~ formation is insensitive to lysosomo - tropic amines ( Caughey et ai . , 1991 ; Taraboulos et al . , 1992 ) whereas receptor - mediated folate uptake is inhibited by NI - LC1 . Subcellular Sites of PrP sc Formation The studies described here coupled with earlier reports be - gin to refine our view of PrP s ~ formation at the subcellular level . It seems likely that PrP s ~ is formed in a compartment bounded by cholesterol - rich , detergent - insoluble membrane domains . Whether these domains might anchor other pro - teins that facilitate the conversion of PrP c into PrP s ~ is un - known ( Raeber et ai . , 1992 ) . Considerable evidence argues that the conversion of PrP c into PrP s ~ involves the post - translational unfolding and refolding of PrP into a patho - genic conformer ( Pan et al . , 1993 ) . Attempts to identify a chemical event that triggers the acquisition of this pathogenic conformation have been unrewarding , to date ( Stahl et al . , 1993 ) . Transgenetic studies argue that the production of PrP s ~ requires formation of an intermediate complex in which PrP s ~ and PrP c interact ( Prusiner et ai . , 1990 ; Scott et al . , 1993 ) . The results of other transgenic mouse studies argue that an additional host protein participates in the generation of PrP s ~ ( Telling et al . , 1994 ) . Whether the subcellular compartment ( s ) in which PrP s ~ is formed is the same in which the initial degradation of PrP c to a 17 - kD polypeptide ( prpc - II ) occurs remains to be established . That both the formation of PrP s ~ and the initial degradation of PrP c occur in the same non - acidic compart - mentbounded by cholesterol - rich membranes is an attractive hypothesis that warrants further study . Since the formation of PrP s ~ uses full - length PrP c , such a compartment would be a metabolic branch point where the fate of PrP c is deter - mined . The minimal formation of CD4PrP s ~ is in accord with the low levels of truncated PrP s ~ which appears to lack a GPI anchor ( Rogers et al . , 1993 ) . These results taken together with the inhibition of PrP s ~ formation by cholesterol deple - tion support the hypothesis that GPI anchorage , probably functioning in concert with cholesterol - dependent pathways , is instrumental in the formation of PrP s ~ in ScN2a cells . Such conclusions must be tempered by the results of studies which suggest that GPI - anchored proteins may not be con - stitutively bound to caveolae , but rather associate with these structures when multimerized , for instance , with divalent antibodies ( Mayor et al . , 1994 ) . Since the PrP antibodies are divalent , it is possible that the behavior of PrP c displayed in Fig . 3 was induced by cross - linking with ct - PrP antibodies . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 129 , 1995 130 However , the results clearly indicate that wtPrP c was inter - nalized differently under the conditions of the experiments than chimeric CD4PrP c which was targeted to clathrin - coated pits . It seems likely that as the roles of caveolae and cholesterol - rich membranous microdomains become better understood , new tools will become available to decipher the subcellular events that feature in prion replication . If PrP s ~ is formed in a single subcellular compartment , then isolation of those or - ganelles might facilitate development of a system for the in vitro formation of PrP s ~ and the identification of proteins which function in this process ( Telling et al . , 1994 ) .
