Synthetic - lethal Interactions Identify Two Novel Genes , SLA / and SLA2 , That Control Membrane Cytoskeleton Assembly in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Douglas A . Holtzman , Shirley Yang , and David G . Drubin Department of Molecular and Cell Biology , University of California , Berkeley , California 94720 Abstract . Abplp is a yeast cortical actin - binding pro - tein that contains an SH3 domain similar to those found in signal transduction proteins that function at the membrane / cytoskeleton interface . Although no de - tectable phenotypes are associated with a disruption allele of ABP1 , mutations that create a requirement for this protein have now been isolated in the previously identified gene SAC6 and in two new genes , SLA / and SLA2 . The SAC6 gene encodes yeast fimbrin , an actin filament - bundling protein . Null mutations in SLA / and SLA2 cause temperature - sensitive growth defects . Slalp contains three SH3 domains and is essential for the proper formation of the cortical actin cytoskeleton . The COOH terminus of Sla2p contains a 200 amino acid region with homology to the COOH terminus of talin , a membrane cytoskeletal protein which is a component of fibroblast focal adhesions . Sla2p is re - quired for cellular morphogenesis and polarization of the cortical cytoskeleton . In addition , synthetic - lethal interactions were observed for double - mutants contain - ing null alleles of SLA2 and SAC6 . In total , the mu - tant phenotypes , sequences , and genetic interactions indicate that we have identified novel proteins that cooperate to control the dynamic cytoskeletal rear - rangements that are required for the development of cell polarity in budding yeast . T HE cortical actin cytoskeleton underlies the plasma membrane and is responsible for cell motility and adhesion , surface phenomena such as membrane ruffling and receptor capping , and transduction of extracel - lular signals to the interior of the cell ( reviewed by Luna and Hitt , 1992 ; Schwartz , 1992 ) . Genetic defects in components of the cortical cytoskeleton can lead to disease states , includ - ing muscular dystrophy and certain hereditary anemias ( reviewed by Luna and Hitt , 1992 ) . A complete understand - ing of how the cortical cytoskeleton functions in these processes is hampered by its complexity ; a large number of cortical cytoskeletal proteins are known , and it is probable that there are others as yet unidentified . However , even if a thorough characterization of the in vitro activities of each protein could be achieved , it is unlikely that this would pro - vide a complete understanding of how the actin cytoskeleton influences cell behavior . One reason for this is that there are likely to be a host of regulatory as well as competetive and cooperative interactions that may be difficult to model in vitro . Moreover , molecular - genetic studies have shown that the in vivo contributions of individual cytoskeletal proteins can be more subtle than previously supposed ( De Lozanne and Spudich , 1987 ; Witke et al . , 1992 ; Adams et al . , 1993 ) , adding an additional obstacle to understanding the cortical cytoskeleton . Saccharomyces cerevisiae has a single actin gene , ACT1 , that is , o90 % identical to most vertebrate actins ( Ng and Abelson , 1980 ; Gallwitz and Sures , 1980 ) and is essential for the polarized growth of the cell ( Novick and Botstein , 1985 ; Read et al . , 1992 ) . Wild - type cells initiate daughter cell formation by choosing a bud site and confining surface growth to this region . Two different actin structures have been identified in budding yeast through fluorescence mi - croscopy techniques ( Adams and Pringle , 1984 ) , and both are likely to contribute to morphogenesis . Actin cables are arrayed parallel to the mother - bud axis and might be in - volved in the spatially directed secretion ( Field and Schek - man , 1980 ) that is essential for the polarized growth of the yeast cell . In addition , cortical actin structures are found as - sociated with the growing surfaces of the cell , and the local - ization of these structures changes in a cell cycle - dependent manner ( Kilmartin and Adams , 1984 ) . The phenotypes of mutants defective in the polarized assembly of the yeast cor - tical cytoskeleton demonstrate a role for these structures in cellular morphogenesis ( Novick and Botstein , 1985 ; Adams et al . , 1989 , 1990 ; Amatruda et al . , 1990 ; Read et al . , 1992 ) . One component of the yeast cortical cytoskeleton is the 65 - kD product of the ABP1 gene ( Drubin et al . , 1988 ) . The NH2 terminus of Abplp shares 41 % similarity with yeast cofilin , a low molecular weight actin filament - sever - ing protein ( Moon et al . , 1993 ) , while its COOH termi - Â© The Rockefeller University Press , 0021 - 9525 / 93 / 08 / 635 / 10 $ 2 . 00 The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 122 , Number 3 , August 1993 635 - 644 635 nus contains a 50 amino acid region termed the src - homology domain 3 ( SH3 ) ~ ( Drubin et al . , 1990 ) . This motif is found in a large and diverse group of proteins that appear to interact with the cortical cytoskeleton ( Koch et al . , 1991 ) . BEM1 , a gene required for morphogenesis in S . cerevisiae , contains two SH3 domains ( Chenevert et al . , 1992 ) , providing an in - dication that this sequence element might be involved in cell polarity development . Interestingly , the SH3 domains of both the c - abl and c - src proto - oncogenes have been shown recently to bind specifically to 3BP - 1 , a protein which has homology to rho - GTPase activators of the bcr / N - chimaerin family ( Cicchetti et al . , 1992 ; Yu et al . , 1992 ) . Proteins of this class might mediate interactions between GTP - binding proteins implicated in polarity development ( reviewed by Drubin , 1991 ) and the cytoskeleton via the SH3 domains of Abplp and / or Bemlp . Overexpression of ABP1 grossly perturbs the cytoskeleton ( Drubin et al . , 1988 ) . Cells with elevated Abplp levels are temperature sensitive ( Ts - ) for their growth and become large and spherical , losing the polarity found in wild - type cells . These studies , along with immunolocalization of Abplp to regions of active cell surface growth , implicated this protein in the polarized growth of S . cerevisiae . How - ever , when the ABP1 gene was disrupted , the mutant cells showed no defects in morphogenesis nor any discernable loss of cytoskeletal polarity ( Drubin et al . , 1990 ) . These results suggested that there might be another gene product ( s ) in yeast that compensates for the loss of Abplp . In an attempt to isolate more components of the membrane cytoskeleton , and to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of cellular morphogenesis , we have undertaken a genetic screen to identify mutations that create a requirement for ABP1 . This strategy , termed a synthetic lethal screen , has been use - ful for the identification of genes that are involved in a com - mon process ( Bender and Pringle , 1991 ) . Mutations that cre - ate a requirement for ABP1 were isolated in three genes . One of these genes , SAC6 , encodes the yeast homolog of fimbrin ( Adams et al . , 1989 ) . The two other genes , S / A / and SLA2 ( Synthetically Lethal with ABP1 ) encode novel proteins . The phenotypes of null mutations in SLA / and SLA2 show that these genes are essential for the assembly and function of the cortical cytoskeleton . Furthermore , the SLA / and SLA2 sequences suggest protein interactions that might allow each gene product to regulate cortical actin cytoskeleton as - sembly . Materials and Methods Yeast Methods and DNA Manipulations Yeast media and genetic manipulations were performed as described ( Sher - man et al . , 1986 ) . Yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table I . Plas - mid DNA manipulations were carded out using standard methods ( Ausubel et al . , 1989 ) . Mutant Isolation The s / a mutants were isolated using a synthetic lethal strategy based on se - lection against the LYS2 and URA3 genes ( Basson et al . , 1987 ) . DDY 262 ( Table I ) contains a nearly complete disruption of the ABP1 gene ( extending from an XhoI site 227 - bp upstream of the start codon to a PvulI site 246 - bp 1 .

Strains were transformed with a centromere plasmid pDD13 ( URA3 , LYS2 , ABP1 ) . upstream of the stop codon , thus leaving only the last 82 amino acids at the COOH terminus intact , see Drubin et al . , 1990 ) , and a centromere - based plasmid ( pDD13 ) which contains the URA3 , LYS2 , and ABP1 genes . A sta - tionary culture of DDY 262 was mutagenized with ethylmethanesulfonate until only 15 % of the ceils were viable . Approximately 25D00 colonies were plated onto 100 YPD plates and then replica plated onto plates containing ct - aminoadipate to select against the LYS2 gene as described ( Sherman et al . , 1986 ) . After 3 d , colonies which failed to grow on the or - amino adipate plates were picked from the master plate and streaked to single colonies on YPD plates . These strains were then tested for their ability to grow on plates containing 5 - Fluoro - orotic acid ( 5 - FOA ) , to select against the URA3 gene ( Boeke et al . , 1984 ) . Colonies which failed to grow under both selections were backcrossed three times to the unmutagenized parent strain ( DDY 262 or DDY 277 ) before the complementation analysis was performed . Complementation Analysis Strains containing all possible double - mutant combinations were generated by mating plasmid - dependent MATa ade2 - 101 ura3 - 52 leu2 - 3 , 112 lys2 - 801am abpl : : LEU2 sla and MATer his4 - 619 1eu2 - 3 , 112 lys2 - 8Olam ura3 - 52 abpl : : LEU2 sla strains , and selecting for diploids on minimal media ( SD ) plates supplemented with uracil and lysine to allow for the loss of pDD13 . These strains were then replica plated to YPD plates and incubated at 37Â°C , and to YPD , ~ aminoadipate and 5 - FOA plates at 25Â°C . Plates were exam - ined for growth at 36 h ( 37Â°C ) , 48 h ( YPD 250C ) , or 72 h ( Â¢ - aminoadipate and 5 - FOA , 25Â°C ) . Cloning , Sequencing , and Disruption of SLA1 and SLA2 A YCp50 library ( Rose et al . , 1987 ) was introduced into the well - behaved Ts - sial - 3 and sla2 - 2 strains , DDY 538 and DDY 539 , by lithium acetate transformation ( Ito et al . , 1983 ; Schiestl and Gietz , 1989 ) . The Ura + transformants were then replica plated onto SD plates lacking uracil and in - cubated at 37Â°C for 36 h . Colonies that grew well at 37Â°C were restreaked and tested for their ability to grow on both SD and 5 - FOA plates at 37Â°C . Nine sial - 3 and two sla2 - 2 colonies displayed plasmid - dependent growth at 37Â°C . Plasmids from these strains were recovered by preparing DNA from the Ts + colonies , and transforming competent DH5c ~ E . coli to ampicillin resistance . The plasmid DNAs were then retransformed into the appropriate strain to confirm their ability to complement the Ts - phenotypes of the sial - 3 and sla2 - 2 strains , respectively . Eight of the nine s / aLcomplementing plasmids were shown to be identical based on restriction mapping , and the remaining plasmid contained a smaller insert that was contained entirely within the other plasmid . The two s / a2 - complementing plasmids shared re - striction fragments , and this information was used to identify the SLA2 open reading frame . DNA sequences were determined using the dideoxy chain The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 122 , 1993 636 termination method ( Sanger et al . , 1977 ) using Sequenase ( United States Biochemical , Cleveland , OH ) according to the suggested protocol of the manufacturer . SLA / was sequenced using an Exonuelease III deletion strategy and double - stranded plasmid DNA preparations ; SLA2 was se - quenced by subcloning fragments into double stranded M13 phage and generating single - stranded DNA templates ( Ausubel et al . , 1989 ) . Linkage of the cloned DNA to the SLA / locus was demonstrated by integrating the URA3 gene into the chromosome adjacent to the open reading frame and mating this strain ( DDY 296 ) to two different Ts - slal mutations . All of the 44 tetrads dissected from the matings showed linkage ( 2 : 2 , Ts Ã· , UraÃ· : Ts - , Ura - ) . For S LA2 , a gene disruption mutant ( described below ) was mated to an sla2 mutant isolated in the genetic screen , and the diploid was then sporulated . A total of 11 complete tetrads and seven tetrads which had three viable spores were scored , and in all cases the spores were temperature sen - sitive , demonstrating linkage between the cloned DNA and the sla2 mu - tation . A complete disruption of the SLA / gene , including 409 nueleotides 5 ' to the NH2 - terminal methionine and 213 nueleotides 3 ' to the stop codon ( from XbaI at position 49 through Sall at position 4402 in the SLA / gene sequence ) , was generated using the " ~ t - disruption " strategy with pRS306 , a yeast integrating plasmid that contains the URA3 gene ( Sikorski and Hieter , 1989 ) . While it is possible that this disruption might interfere with the expression of neighboring genes , the cortical defects of the s / a / deletion strain ( see Results ) are the same as those observed in the Ts - sial mutants isolated in the genetic screen ( data not shown ) , and no additional pheno - types were observed in the null mutant . The disruption of SLA2 removes all but the first 30 amino acids of the coding sequence ( from the SphI site at position 862 through the Bell at position 3675 , which includes the stop codon of the SLA2 gene sequence ) by a simple one step gene replacement ( Rothstein , 1983 ) . Briefly , a plasmid containing the SLA2 gene on a 4 . 5okb EcoRI fragment was digested with SphI and treated with T4 DNA Polymer - ase before Bell linkers were ligated onto the ends . This plasmid was then digested with BclI , and a 1 . 1 - kb Bgill fragment containing the URA3 gene was ligated to generate the disruption fragment . The resulting plasmid was then digested with EcoRI and transformed into DDY 288 , a wild - type diploid strain . Both gene disruptions were confirmed by Southern blotting techniques ( Ausubel et al . , 1989 ) . Microscopy Yeast cells grown to early log phase in YPD were prepared for immuno - fluorescence as previously described ( Pringle et al . , 1991 ) . Affinity - purified rabbit anti - aetin antibodies were used at a 1 : 50 dilution and visualized using fluorescein - labeled goat anti - rabbit secondary antibodies ( Cappel / Organon Teknika , Malvern , PA ) at a dilution of 1 : 1 , 000 . Ceils were photographed with a Zeiss Axioscope fluorescence microscope with an HB100 W / Z high pressure mercury lamp and a Zeiss 100x Plan - Neofluar oil immersion ob - jective ( Carl Zeiss Inc . , Thornwood , NY ) with either phase or Nomarski optics . Results Isolation of ABPl - requiring Mutants The strategy that we used to isolate mutations that require ABP1 relies on the ability to select against the URA3 and LYS2 genes with 5 - FOA and t ~ - aminoadipate , respectively ( Boeke et al . , 1984 ; Chattoo and Sherman , 1979 ) , and on the fact that in the absence of positive selection , centromere - based plasmids are lost from a small percentage of the cells that form a colony ( Basson et al . , 1987 ) . The starting haploid strain , DDY 262 ( Table I ) , contains a complete disruption of ABP1 ( see Materials and Methods ) . Additionally , this strain was transformed with pDD13 , a centromere - based plasmid that contains the ABP1 , URA3 , and LYS2 genes . The population of cells that loses the plasmid during growth on non - selective plates will be insensitive to the negative selec - tions by 5 - FOA and u - aminoadipate . After mutagenesis , however , cells that have aquired a mutation which makes ABP1 essential will be unable to lose the plasmid , and will Table II . Complementation Analysis of ABPl - requiring mutants Number of Group Gene alleles ( Ts - ) I SLA1 13 ( 5 ) II SLA2 5 ( 5 ) III SAC6 4 ( 4 ) For each complementation group , the gene name , total number of alleles , and number of temperature - sensitive alleles ( ) are shown . therefore fail to form colonies on either ct - aminoadipate or 5 - FOA plates . We tested , ' , , 25 , 000 ethylmethanesulfonate - mutagenized colonies for their ability to grow on tx - aminoadipate plates . Colonies ( 1148 ) which showed reduced growth were picked . These strains were then analyzed for their ability to grow on plates which contained 5 - FOA . A total of 148 colonies failed to grow under both negative selection schemes and were thus good candidates for ABPl - requiring mutants , After three rounds of backcrossing , 24 independent strains showed segregation of a single nuclear mutation that made the ceils dependent on pDD13 for their growth . The other 124 strains appeared to require multiple mutations to create the plasmid dependence , or had severe defects in their ability to sporu - late , and were not studied further . The 24 well - behaved strains were also tested for their ability to grow at both high ( 37Â°C ) and low ( 14Â°C ) temperatures , and 14 strains showed a Ts - growth defect genetically linked to the ct - aminoadi - pate / 5 - FOA sensitivity ( Table II ) . No cold - sensitive muta - tions ( Cs - ) were found . Two of these 24 strains could not be complemented by a plasmid which carried only the LYS2 and ABP1 genes , and were subsequently shown to require the URA3 gene for their growth ( N . Machin , unpublished obser - vations ) . To determine the number of loci that were represented by the 22 ABPl - requiring mutant strains , a complementation test was performed . Diploids created by crossing the haploid single mutants ( see Materials and Methods ) were tested for their ability to grow on 5 - FOA . All of the mutations isolated were found to be recessive . The 22 strains fell into three complementation groups ( Table II ) . The four mutations in complementation group III are new alleles of SAC6 , a gene which encodes an actin filament - bundling protein that is the yeast homolog of fimbrin ( Adams et al . , 1989 , 1991 ) . This was determined by a failure of these strains to complement a null allele of SAC6 , and additionally by demonstrating link - age to a marked SAC6 locus ( data not shown ) . The two other complementation groups , termed SLA / and SLA2 , contained 13 and five alleles , respectively . Isolation and Sequence Analysis of the SI . A1 and SLA2 Genes The SLA / and SLA2 genes were isolated by complementing the temperature sensitivity of mutant alleles of these genes ( see Materials and Methods ) . For SLA / , targeted integration was used to show that the cloned DNA represents the mutant locus ; for SLA2 , an sla2 gene disruption mutant ( see below ) was mated to an sla2 mutant isolated in the original screen and spore analysis was used to prove linkage ( see Materials and Methods ) . In each case , deletion analysis and subcloning were used to identify the minimum complementing frag - Hoitzman et al .

( D ) Comparison of one extended repeat from Slalp to the related region of bindins from Strongelocentrotus pur - puratus ( S . pur . ) ( Gao et al . , 1986 ) and Strongelocentrotus franciscanis ( S . fran . ) ( Minor et al . , 1991 ) . The SLA / se - quence data are available from EMBL under accession num - ber Z22810 . ment , and the nucleotide sequence of the fragment was then determined . The sequences of the predicted protein products are shown in Figs . 1 and " ~ 2 . The SLA / gene contains a 1244 amino acid open reading frame that could encode a protein of 136 kD . Slalp shares structural homology with Abplp ; Abplp has one SH3 do - main , while Slalp has three of these domains ( Fig . 1 , A and B ) . Another interesting feature of Slalp is a repeat structure found in the COOH terminus , including numerous elements with the core TGGAMMP ( Fig . 1 , A and C ) . This region is nearly devoid of charged residues , with only three acidic and eight basic residues in the COOH - terminal 386 amino acids . Database searches with this sequence identified significant similarity to a region of the sea urchin sperm adhesion pro - tein bindin ( Fig . 1 D ) , although many of the Slalp repeats are more divergent and / or are truncated ( Fig . 1 A ) . In strik - ing contrast to the COOH terminus , the central third of Slalp is highly charged ; one stretch of 50 amino acids contains 37 ( 74 % ) charged residues ( Fig . 1 A ) . The SLA2 gene sequence predicts a 109 - kD protein prod - uct of 968 amino acids ( Fig . 2 ) . A database search identified significant similarity between Sla2p and a Caenorhabditis elegans talinlike protein ( Genpept accession No . celzk370 - 3 ; Bob Waterston , personal communication ) . The sequences are 22 % identical and 34 % similar in a pairwise alignment . The COOH termini of these proteins are more highly related , with 34 % identity and 46 % similarity over the last 200 residues . In addition , the COOH termini of both these sequences are related to murine talin ( Rees et al . , 1990 ) . Sla2p is 28 % identical and 36 % similar to murine talin over this same 200 amino acids ( Fig . 2 ) . Several regions ( e . g . , GLI / LSAA and V / IAASTI / AQL , beginning at residues 818 and 861 of Sla2p , respectively ) are well conserved in all three proteins .

Null Mutations in SLA1 and SLA2 Cause Morphological Defects To determine the in vivo roles of Slalp and Sla2p , homolo - gous recombination was used to delete one copy of SLA / and SLA2 ( independently ) in wild - type diploid strains ( see Materials and Methods ) , and the heterozygous diploids were Figure 3 . sial and sla2 deletion strains show temperature - sensi - tive growth defects .

Deletions of either SLA / or SL42 make cells temperature sensitive for growth , with the sla2 deletion strains showing a narrower permissive temperature range ( Fig . 3 ) . sial deletion mutant strains grow well at 34Â°C , while sla2A mutants fail to grow at 34Â°C and grow poorly at 30Â°C . sial and sla2 null strains also show morphological defects , despite the fact that these cells have an intact copy of ABP1 . Wild - type diploid strains are ellipsoid in shape ( Fig . 4 , a and c ) . In contrast , sla2 null strains are spherical in appearance , even at 200C ( Fig . 4 i ) . In addition , DAPI staining showed that a small number of cells ( ' ~ 3 % ) are multinucleate ( data not shown ) .

At non - permissive temperatures ( 37Â°C ) s / a / null strains show more pronounced morphological defects ( Fig . 4 g ) .

The morphologic defects of s / a / A and sla2A mutants , like those seen with other mu - tants defective in cytoskeletal proteins ( Liu and Brescher , 1989 ; Amatruda et al . , 1990 ; Adams et al . , 1991 ) , are hetero - geneous . Further studies using synchronized populations of cells will be required to determine if these genes function at a particular phase in the cell cycle or are required continu - ously throughout the budding process . sial and sla2 Mutants Have Unique Cytoskeletal Defects SLA / and SLA2 are both required for the normal organization of the cortical cytoskeleton . The actin cytoskeleton of wild - type cells shows two identifiable structures . Actin cables are arrayed parallel to the mother - bud axis , while cortical patches are highly polarized , being concentrated at the bud surface during vegetative growth ( Fig . 5 , a and c ) ( Adams and Pringle , 1984 ; Kilmartin and Adams , 1984 ) . In sial null strains , a dramatic defect exists in the formation of the corti - cal cytoskeleton , even at the nominally permissive tempera - ture of 20Â°C . Instead of the regular punctate staining seen in wild - type cells , fewer , larger " chunks " of actin are visible in all cells ( Fig . 5 e ) . Despite this defect , the cortical actin structures are properly polarized to the bud surface . These structures are likely to be composed of actin filaments as they stain with rhodamine - phalloidin , a polymer - specific probe ( data not shown ) . Actin cables are properly oriented in slal null strains , although their fluorescence intensity ap - pears reduced compared to staining in wild - type cells . Upon shift to non - permissive temperature ( 37Â°C ) , the cortical ac - tin structures become delocalized , and cell death becomes apparent based on phase microscopy observations ( not shown ) . In addition , (cid:127)5 - 10 % of the cells show other defects in actin organization , such as bars of actin and actin staining in the nucleus ( data not shown ) . The sla2A strain shows a different defect in its cortical cytoskeleton . This strain shows a delocalization of cortical structures , even at 20Â°C ( Fig . 5 i ) . Cells also show an appar - ent increase in the number of cortical structures per unit sur - face area . Cables are present in these cells , though they ap - pear to be oriented randomly and are often obscured by the large number of cortical structures . Upon shift to the non - permissive temperature of 37Â°C , sla2A cells increase in size , and after 90 min , as stated above , ~ 20 % of the ceils are mul - tinucleate ( Fig . 5 , k and 1 ) .

Scale bar in a is 5 / zm and applies to all panels . Genetic Interactions between SLA1 , SLA2 , and SAC6 Null mutations in the nonessential SLA / , S / . M2 , and SAC6 genes all create a requirement for the ABP1 gene , although some viable double - mutant spores that are severely com - promised for their ability to grow do germinate ( Adams et al . , 1993 , and data not shown ) . To determine whether the SLA1 , $ I212 , and SAC6 genes showed any other examples of functional interactions , heterozygous diploids for all three pair - wise combinations of null alleles were sporulated , and the dissected tetrads were analyzed for their ability to grow at a variety of temperatures , sla2A - sac6A double - mutant spores are extremely sick , with > 30 % inferred spore invia - bility ( Fig . 6 B ) . The s / a2A - sac6A double - mutant spores that do germinate do not show growth after 72 h at 20Â°C when replica plated ( data not shown ) , s / a / A - sac6A double mutants are viable , Ts - strains that show the same permis - sive temperature range as the single mutants ( Fig . 6 C , and data not shown ) . The s / a / A - sla2A double - mutant strains are viable , but are sicker than null alleles of either SLA / or SL , 42 ( Fig . 6 A ) . Double - mutant strains grow poorly at 20Â°C and 25Â°C , and fail to grow at 30Â°C , a temperature at which both s / a / and sla2 single mutant strains are viable ( Fig . 3 , and data not shown ) . The interactions between mutations in ABP1 , SAC6 , SLAI , and SLA2 are summarized in Fig . 7 . Discussion In this study we have identified proteins required for cortical cytoskeletal function based on their interactions in the living cell . Mutations in three genes can create a requirement for the cortical actin - binding protein Abplp in S . cerevisiae . One of these genes , SAC6 , encodes an actin filament - bundling protein previously shown to be a component of the cortical cytoskeleton . The two new genes isolated in this screen , SLA / and SLA2 , have homologies which suggest that they are novel components or regulators of the actin cytoskeleton . Phenotypic analysis of slalA and sla2A mu - tants confirms that these genes , unlike ABP1 , are essential for proper membrane cytoskeleton assembly and morpho - genesis . One unexpected finding is the structural diversity of pro - teins that , based on genetic interactions , define a function - ally overlapping set . For example , although null mutations Holtzman et al . Genetic Analysis of Yeast Membrane Cytoskeleton 641 Figure 6 . Genetic interactions between s / a / , sla2 , and sac6 deletion mutations . ( A - C ) Heterozygous diploids containing all three pair - wise combinations of null mutant alleles were sporulated , dissected and grown for 4 d at 25Â°C before being photographed . Colonies were then replica plated to determine the segregation of the marked mutant alleles .

Importantly , not all double - mutant combinations within the group of four genes studied here show a negative synergism at 25Â°C ( e . g . , sac6A - slah ~ ) . This demonstrates that the con - tributions of Sac6p , Slalp , and Sla2p to cell viability are not identical , and therefore that the nature of their redundancies with Abplp may also be distinct . Understanding the synthetic - lethal relationships between mutations in ABP1 , SAC6 , SLA1 , and SLA2 could shed light on the roles that their protein products play in the regulation of the cortical cytoskeleton . Null mutations in SAC6 , SLA1 , and SLA2 all result in inviability at 37Â°C , indicating that the yeast actin cytoskeleton is functionally compromised at high I I - - ~ - I s , . 2p i : : : ! ! i ! i : ~ ! i ! : i : ! : : i ~ i : : ! i ~ t Sac6p \ I L ~ Slalp SH3 ~ Cofilin - like ~ Actin - binding Talin - like ~ Bindin - like ~ - Synthetic Effects ~ 1 . . . . . . ~ Additive Effects Figure 7 .

How can we explain the genetic interactions be - tween mutations in this set of genes ? One model is suggested by biochemical analyses of cytoskeletal components . In vitro , many actin - binding proteins are multifunctional ( Pol - lard and Cooper , 1986 ; Hartwig and Kwiatkowski , 1991 ) , and perhaps this is reflected in the genetic relationships we observe . Thus , Abplp might be multi functional , and Sac6p , Slalp , and Sla2p might be redundant with different biochemi - cal activities of Abplp . An additional point that must be con - sidered is that abpl null mutants grow well at 37Â°C . It may be that the temperature sensitivity of strains lacking either Sac6p , Slalp , or Sla2p is due to the loss of functions that are not redundant with Abplp . In support of this possibility , we have isolated eight alleles of SLA / which create a dependence on ABP1 but do not cause cells to become Ts - . These al - leles may be specifically deficient in an Slalp activity which is redundant with Abplp while retaining other functions necessary for growth at high temperature . On a biochemical level , it is possible that the synthetic - lethal interactions are due to the loss of activities that exert similar effects on the actin cytoskeleton , albeit through different mechanisms . For example , it is possible that pro - teins which cap the ends of filaments and proteins which bind to the sides of filaments might each slow actin filament depo - lymerization in vivo . In addition , the function of the yeast actin cytoskeleton can be affected by gene dosage ( Drubin et al . , 1988 ; Wertman et al . , 1992 ) , and this may help to ex - plain the results of our screen . In this case , Sac6p , Abplp , and Sla2p might all have similar effects on actin organiza - tion , and cell viability would depend on the expression of at least two of these proteins . Sac6p is known to bundle actin filaments ( Adams et al . , 1991 ) . In vitro assays to determine the effects that Abplp , Slalp , and Sla2p have on actin assem - bly may provide clues to help understand the genetically defined redundancies . While all of these gene products can affect the actin cytoskeleton ( Drubin et al . , 1988 ; Adams et al . , 1991 ; Fig . 5 ) , it is also possible that the lethality of cer - tain double - mutant combinations is the result of deficiencies that are unrelated to the effects these proteins have on the or - The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 122 , 1993 642 ganization of actin . For example , some mutant combinations might hinder the integration of cortical events with those oc - curring in other compartments of the cell . What role do SLA / and SLA2 play in polarized growth and the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton ? Mutations in both genes affect the ellipsoid cell shape characteristic of wild - type diploid cells , with the mutants growing more spherically . Immunofluorescence experiments reveal striking defects in the cortical cytoskeletons of these strains . Significantly , the s / a / A and sla2A defects are distinct , indicating that these genes play fundamentally different roles in the cell . The s / a / A mutants show a unique defect in the formation of their cortical cytoskeleton . Previously , all mutations affecting the cortical actin cytoskeleton were found to cause a delocaliza - tion of wild - type actin structures ( as judged by immunoflu - orescence experiments ) . In s / a / null strains , a smaller num - ber of F - actin structures are found at the cortex , and these structures appear larger in size . However , these aberrant structures are properly polarized to the growing bud . Slalp might therefore be involved in controlling the size of the cor - tical patches , perhaps by regulating the nucleation of fila - ments at the cortex . A decrease in the number of actin nucle - ation sites might be expected to favor incorporation of monomeric actin onto preexisting filaments , resulting in fewer , larger structures . In contrast to s / a / A strains , sla2A strains show a cytoskeletal phenotype more similar to muta - tions that affect cell polarity ( e . g . , cdc42 , cdc43 ) , where the cortical patches are uniformly distributed at the cell cortex rather than being concentrated in the bud , and cell growth is isotropic rather than polarized ( Adams et al . , 1990 ) . Therefore , Sla2p might act in concert with proteins such as Cdc42p and Cdc43p to limit the region of cortical patch for - mation to the cortex of the bud . A complete understanding of yeast morphogenesis will re - quire determining how actin assembly is controlled both spa - tially and temporally . Slalp contains three SH3 domains . Abplp and Bemlp , other proteins implicated in polarized growth in S . cerevisiae , also contain SH3 domains ( Drubin et al . , 1990 ; Chenevert et al . , 1992 ) . This motif has been shown recently to bind specific ligands including 3BP - 1 , a protein which has a region of homology with rho GTPase ac - tivators of the bcr / N - chimaerin family ( Cicchetti et al . , 1992 ) . Finding an SH3 - 1igand ( s ) in yeast might help estab - lish a biochemical link between the bud site selection / polar - ity genes and the cytoskeleton ( reviewed in Chant and Prin - gle , 1991 ; Drubin , 1991 ) . Unlike SLA / , however , null mutations in BEM1 are not lethal in combination with abpl null alleles ( Chenevert , J . , and D . A . Holtzman , unpublished observations ) , indicating that although these SH3 - containing proteins all contribute to the development of cell polarity , distinctions exist between their specific functions . This is perhaps not surprising as various SH3 domains , while pos - sessing several well - conserved consensus residues , do show significant divergence ( Musacchio et al . , 1992 ) and different affinities in their interactions with ligands ( Cicchetti et al . , 1992 ; Ren et al . , 1993 ) . Another striking feature of Slalp is the extensive repeat structure of the COOH terminus that shows limited homol - ogy to bindins , a family of species - specific sperm adhesion proteins from sea urchins . Bindins have been shown to inter - act directly with phospholipid vesicles and to facilitate vesi - cle fusion in vitro ( Glabe , 1985a , b ) . It is interesting to note that the amino acid composition of this sequence is hydro - phobic , a characteristic of viral fusion proteins ( White , 1992 ) , although no activity has yet been ascribed to this re - gion of bindin . Perhaps the COOH terminus of Slalp associ - ates with the plasma membrane , or contributes to localized vesicle fusion at the growing surfaces of the cell . Small GTP binding proteins of the rho family ( CDC42 , Rtt03 , RH04 ) are required for bud site formation and the asymmetric disposition of the cortical actin cytoskeleton ( Adams et al . , 1990 ; Johnson and Pringle , 1990 ; Matsui and Toh - e , 1992 ) . In fibroblasts , rho proteins are essential for mitogen - induced formation of focal adhesions ( Ridley and Hall , 1992 ) , protein complexes that link actin stress fibers to the plasma membrane and extracellular matrix ( reviewed in Burridge et al . , 1988 ) . It is intriguing that the other gene isolated in our screen shows significant similarity to the COOH terminus of talin , a protein recruited to focal adhe - sions by the actions of rho proteins and capable of nucleating actin filament assembly in vitro ( Ridley and Hall , 1992 ; Muguruma et al . , 1990 ; Kaufmann et al . , 1991 ) . By analogy , rho - like proteins in S . cerevisiae might regulate the forma - tion of a cortical protein complex of which Sla2p is a compo - nent , and this in turn could influence the local assembly of the actin cytoskeleton . The in vivo activity of rho proteins is likely to be downregulated by bcr - GAP molecules ( Dick - mann et al . , 1991 ; Settleman et al . , 1992 ) , and this interac - tion might be modulated by SH3 - containing proteins . It is now important to determine the in vivo localizations of both Sla proteins , and to determine if the s / a / and sla2 mutations affect the localization of other components of the cortical cytoskeleton . In conclusion , the actin cytoskeleton of S . cerevisiae pro - vides a facile genetic route to examine the complexities of the eukaryotic cell cortex . Our identification of proteins re - quired for membrane cytoskeletal function and assembly in vivo provides a step toward developing a deeper understand - ing of the biochemical basis for the genetic redundancies in the cytoskeleton , and the way intracellular and extracellular signals are integrated to regulate cytoskeletal assembly and cell polarity .
