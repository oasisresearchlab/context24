Translational tracer diffusion of spherical macromolecules in crowded suspensions of rodlike colloids is investigated . Experiments are done using several kinds of spherical tracers in fd - virus suspensions . A wide range of size ratios L / 2 a of the length L of the rods and the diameter 2 a of the tracer sphere is covered by combining several experimental methods : ﬂuorescence correlation spectroscopy for small tracer spheres , dynamic light scattering for intermediate sized spheres , and video microscopy for large spheres . Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy is shown to measure long - time diffusion only for relatively small tracer spheres . Scaling of diffusion coefﬁcients with a / j , predicted for static networks , is not found for our dynamical network of rods ~ with j the mesh size of the network ! . Self - diffusion of tracer spheres in the dynamical network of freely suspended rods is thus fundamentally different as compared to cross - linked networks . A theory is developed for the rod - concentration dependence of the translational diffusion coefﬁcient at low rod concentrations for freely suspended rods . The proposed theory is based on a variational solution of the appropriate Smoluchowski equation without hydrodynamic interactions . The theory can , in principle , be further developed to describe diffusion through dynamical networks at higher rod concentrations with the inclusion of hydrodynamic interactions . Quantitative agreement with the experiments is found for large tracer spheres , and qualitative agreement for smaller spheres . This is probably due to the increasing importance of hydrodynamic interactions as compared to direct interactions as the size of the tracer sphere decreases . © 2005 American Institute of Physics . @ DOI : 10 . 1063 / 1 . 1834895 # I . INTRODUCTION There is a large body of literature on diffusion of spheres and , to a lesser extent , of rods . Much less is known about diffusion of spheres in host dispersions of rodlike particles , which is both of biological and technological importance . Due to the relevance of long - time self - diffusion for mass transport in cells , the majority of diffusion experiments of this kind reported so far are on self - diffusion of proteins in suspensions of F actin , both in vitro and in vivo . 1 – 10 Contrary to F - actin networks in vivo , where many actin - binding pro - teins regulate actin polymerization , F - actin networks in vitro are ~ sometimes cross linked ! networks of relatively long ﬁla - ments with a highly dispersed length . Uncontrolled bundling of ﬁlaments is sometimes found and continuous polymeriza - tion and depolymerization of the ﬁlaments occurs ~ for an overview of properties of actin and the role played by bind - ing proteins , see Ref . 11 ! . The dynamics of F - actin networks is so slow , that it does not couple to the diffusion of tracer spheres . This leads to scaling of the diffusive properties with a / j ~ where a is the tracer sphere radius and j the mesh size of the F - actin network ! . As will be seen , such a scaling is not found for highly dynamical networks of rods , such as the fd - virus suspensions investigated in the present paper . Anomalous diffusion in F - actin networks and the cell interior has been found in Refs . 4 , 7 , 8 , and 10 , where a tracer sphere resides for some time within a ‘‘cage’’ formed by the network , and occasionally ‘‘jumps’’ from one cage to the other . Due to the very slow dynamics of the cross linked or strongly entangled F - actin networks , a spherical Brownian particle is captured in a quasistatic cage from which it es - capes on a time scale that is much larger than the time the tracer needs to diffuse over distances comparable to the size of each cage ~ typical length and time scales for various dy - THE JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS 122 , 044905 ~ 2005 ! 122 , 044905 - 1 0021 - 9606 / 2005 / 122 ( 4 ) / 044905 / 13 / $ 22 . 50 © 2005 American Institute of Physics Downloaded 21 Dec 2006 to 134 . 94 . 122 . 39 .

F - actin networks are thus quite complicated by themselves . To gain in fundamental understanding of transport of spheri - cal Brownian particles through highly dynamical networks , where the dynamics of the network couples to the diffusive properties of a tracer sphere , other types of host systems are therefore more appropriate . In four very recent papers , diffusion of spheres in host suspensions of slender particles , other than F actin , have been reported : nucleosome core particles in dispersions of DNA , 13 colloidal spheres in solutions of ‘‘living polymers’’ , 14 colloidal spheres in dispersions of xanthan , 15 and polymer spheres in dilute suspensions of tobacco mosaic virus . 16 Diffusion of the nucleosome core particles in DNA is in part controlled by ‘‘histone tails’’ that fold out of the pro - tein core on increasing ionic strength . These histone tails interact speciﬁcally with DNA , and lead to adsorption of the nucleosome core particle on DNA . Adsorption leads to anomalous , ‘‘stretched exponential , ’’ diffusive behavior and an almost discontinuous jump of the diffusion coefﬁcient at the ionic strength where unfolding occurs . 13 These experi - ments were done using ﬂuorescence correlation spectros - copy , which for the small protein probably probes long - time diffusion . Short - and long - time translational diffusion of tracer spheres ~ with radii 125 and 250 nm ! in a host disper - sion living polymers have been discussed in Ref . 14 . The living polymers consist of self - associating monomers bis - ~ ethylhexylureido ! toluene ~ EHUT ! . Both the polymerization / depolymerization kinetics of EHUT and the length distribu - tion of the living polymers probably have a strong inﬂuence on the diffusive properties of the tracer spheres . Short - time translational and rotational diffusion of a tracer sphere with a radius of 93 nm in high molecular weight xanthan disper - sions has been studied in Ref . 15 . The xanthan used in this study is a relatively ﬂexible molecule ~ contour length 2 m m and persistence length 120 nm ! . Diffusion in these xanthan solutions is probably comparable to diffusion in polymer net - works . In Ref . 16 , diffusion of polymer spheres and tobacco mosaic virus ~ TMV ! particles in their mixtures with low TMV concentration have been studied . Here , the emphasis is on the salt concentration dependence of diffusion coefﬁcients of both species . The dependence of diffusion coefﬁcients on the concentration of both species has not been probed in these experiments . In the present study we use fd virus as a rodlike colloidal host particle . These are relative stiff rods , which are chemi - cally inert without any speciﬁc interactions with the tracer spheres . Fd - virus suspensions have been recognized before as very good model system for rod dispersions in connection to ~ micro ! rheology 17 – 20 and phase transitions ~ sometimes of binary mixtures with spherical colloids or polymers ! . 21 – 24 There are a number of theories on translational diffusion of tracer spheres through networks . 25 – 28 In all these theories it is assumed that the network can be described as being ﬁxed in space . This results in the above mentioned a / j scal - ing , which is shown to be invalid for dynamical networks of rods ~ see Ref . 14 and the present paper ! . So far , there is no theory that incorporates the dynamics of the network itself on diffusion of tracer spheres . An exception are a mode - coupling theory 29 and simulations 30 on diffusion close to the isotropic - nematic phase transition , where slowing down of orientational diffusion is a necessary condition for the valid - ity of the mode - coupling approach . In the present paper we report on experiments on tracer diffusion in dynamical networks of rigid , chemically inert fd - virus rods , and propose a theory for low concentrations of rods , where Brownian motion of the rods is accounted for . The theory is discussed in Sec . II . Its validity is limited to concentrations below the overlap concentration , but might be extended ~ in future work ! to describe diffusion in highly en - tangled dynamical networks as well . The colloidal systems are introduced in Sec . III . Fd - virus particles are used as host particles ~ contour length 880 nm , thickness 6 nm , and per - sistence length 2 . 2 m m ! , while the radii of the colloidal spheres vary between 3 and 500 nm . Due to this large range of tracer sizes we needed various techniques to probe tracer diffusion . These experimental techniques are discussed in some detail in Sec . IV . Experimental results are presented in Sec . V , and are compared to the theoretical predictions for low rod concentrations . II . THEORY : A VARIATIONAL APPROACH FOR LOW ROD CONCENTRATIONS AND BIG SPHERES In the theory discussed here , the assumption will be that the tracer sphere interacts with uncorrelated rods at each in - stant of time , that is , with rods which do not mutually inter - act with each other . This limits the validity of the theory to rod concentrations below the overlap concentration . Hydro - dynamic interactions between the tracer sphere and the rods are neglected in the present treatment . In a future extension of the theory , hydrodynamic interactions and correlations be - tween rods might be included . A . The variational approach Little is known about long - time self - diffusion of spheres in host dispersions of rigid , Brownian rods . A variational approach that has been successfully applied to self - diffusion of rods 31 will be formulated here for self - diffusion of spheres in suspensions of rods , to leading order in concentration of the rods . This approach leads to predictions for the coefﬁ - cient a in an expansion of the long - time self - diffusion coef - ﬁcient D s of the spheres with respect to the volume fraction w of the rods , D s 5 D 0 @ 1 2 aw 1 O ~ w 2 ! # , ~ 1 ! where D 0 5 k B T / 6 ph a is the Einstein diffusion coefﬁcient of a single , noninteracting sphere with radius a in solvent with shear viscosity h . The variational approach presented here renders numerical values for a as a function of the rod aspect ratio ~ L is the length and D the thickness of the rods ! , p 5 L / D , ~ 2 ! and the ratio of the length of the rod and the diameter 2 a of the sphere , q 5 L / 2 a . ~ 3 ! 044905 - 2 Kang etal .

This can be done when the sphere and rod are not ‘‘massive’’ bodies compared to each other . That is , the sphere should not be larger than the rod length ~ that is 2 a < L ) , while the rod diameter should not be larger than the sphere diameter ~ that is D < 2 a ) . Hydrody - namic interactions are thus probably not so important in the range , 1 < q < p . ~ 4 ! Results presented here are limited to this range of size ratios . However , as will be seen later when comparing to experi - ments , hydrodynamic interactions probably become more important when the size of the tracer sphere is decreased . For a quantitative prediction of the initial rod - concentration de - pendence of the tracer diffusion coefﬁcient for relatively small tracer spheres , hydrodynamic interactions should be taken into account . The present theory will turn out to agree quantitatively with experiments for relatively large tracer spheres , but only qualitatively for small tracer spheres . End - capped rods will be considered , where L is the total length of the rod . L / D 5 1 thus corresponds to a sphere with diameter D ~ see Fig . 1 ! . The basic idea of the variational approach is as follows . As noted by Batchelor , 32 the long - time self - diffusion coefﬁ - cient can be written as D s 5 k B T / g , where the friction coef - ﬁcient g includes both interactions of the sphere with solvent molecules and the rods . Hence , a weak constant force F ext is exerted on the sphere , until the sphere attains a stationary ensemble averaged velocity ^ v & , from which the friction co - efﬁcient follows as , F ext 5 g ^ v & . ~ 5 ! The calculation of the long - time self - diffusion coefﬁcients thus amounts to calculate the stationary velocity of the sphere due to a constant , weak external force . On the Brown - ian time scale , and with the neglect of hydrodynamic inter - actions , this velocity is equal to , ^ v & 5 b D 0 @ F ext 2 N ~ ^ „ 1 V & 1 k B T ^ „ 1 ln $ P % & ! # , ~ 6 ! to leading order in the concentration of host rods . Here , b 5 1 / k B T ~ with k B Boltzmann’s constant and T the tempera - ture ! , N is the number of rods in the system under consider - ation , V the pair - interaction energy of the tracer sphere and the host rods , and P the probability density function ~ pdf ! of the phase space coordinates of the tracer sphere and a rod . Furthermore , „ 1 is the gradient operator with respect to the position coordinate r 1 of the tracer sphere . The second term between the rectangular brackets in Eq . ~ 6 ! is the force that rods exert on the sphere while the third term is the Brownian force on the sphere . The ensemble averaged velocity can be calculated once the pdf P is known . In order to calculate a in Eq . ~ 1 ! , it is sufﬁcient to consider the tracer sphere to interact with a single rod , in which case the pdf P is a function of the position coordinate r 1 of the sphere , the position coordinate r 2 of the rod , and the orientation uˆ of the rod , which is the unit vector along its long axis .

These expressions have been shown in Ref . 32 to accurately describe diffusion of single rods for a large range of size ratios . For small forces , one can write , FIG . 1 .

This Smoluchowski equation for the perturbation C of the equilibrium pdf due to the external force acting on the tracer sphere is too complicated to solve analytically . Instead we shall discuss a method to obtain a variational solution . The following theorem 33 will be employed to arrive at a varia - tional solution of the Smoluchowski equation . Consider the functional , F @ v # [ ^ v u A ˆ v & 2 2 ^ v u f & , ~ 14 ! with A ˆ a linear , Hermitian , and negative deﬁnite operator with respect to the inner product ^ ﬂ u ﬂ & , and with f a known function . The unique function C that maximizes this func - tional is easily shown to be the solution of the equation A ˆ C 5 f . The Smoluchowski equation ~ 13 ! can be recast in this form as follows . First deﬁne the backward Smolu - chowski operator L ˆ B ( 0 ) as the Hermitian conjugate of L ˆ ( 0 ) with respect to the unweighted inner product ^ u uu v & [ * d R 1 * d R 2 r d uˆ u v , where r is the integral over the unit spherical surface , that is , over all orientations uˆ of a rod . By partial integration it can be shown that , L ˆ B ~ 0 ! v 5 e ~ „ 1 2 b @ „ 1 V # ! (cid:149) „ 1 v 1 ~ „ 2 2 b @ „ 2 V # ! (cid:149) „ 2 v 1 e t ~ „ 2 2 b @ „ 2 V # !

The square brackets around „ j V and R ˆ V are used to indicate that the differentiations are limited to the pair - interaction po - tential V . By substitution it is found that , L ˆ ( 0 ) @ P eq v # 5 P eq L ˆ B ( 0 ) v . The Smoluchowski equation ~ 13 ! can thus be rewritten as , L ˆ B ~ 0 ! C 52 @ P eq # 2 1 L ˆ ~ 1 ! P eq . ~ 16 ! By partial integration it is found that L ˆ B ( 0 ) is Hermitian with respect to the weighted inner product ^ u u v & [ * d R 1 * d R 2 r d uˆ P eq u v , that is , ^ u u L ˆ B ( 0 ) v & 5 ^ L ˆ B ( 0 ) u u v & . Furthermore , the backward Smoluchowski operator is nega - tive deﬁnite with respect to the weighted inner product .

B . The trial function As a last step , a reasonable trial function C has to be chosen with respect to which the functional ~ 18 ! should be maximized . For spherical host particles , instead of rods , the exact solution of the Smoluchowski equation at low concen - trations reads C 5 ( ] / ] Z ) 1 / R ~ see Refs . 34 and 35 ! . This function reﬂects a decrease of local concentration in the wake of the tracer sphere , and an increase ahead of the sphere . The corresponding value for a in this case is 2 ~ in - cluding hydrodynamic interactions changes this number to 2 . 10 ! . Note that normalization of the pdf in Eq . ~ 12 ! requires that , E d R R d uˆ C 5 0 . ~ 19 ! This condition is satisﬁed by the above mentioned exact so - lution for a sphere , since it is antisymmetric on reﬂection in the xy plane . Regarding the rod as a string of spherical beads , a reasonable trial function for rodlike host particles is a sum of the above mentioned solution for a sphere over the beads , that is , C ~ R , u ˆ ! 5 ] ] Z H a 1 1 R 1 a 2 E 2 1 / 2 @ ~ L / D ! 2 1 # 1 / 2 @ ~ L / D ! 2 1 # dl 1 u R 2 l uˆ u J , ~ 20 ! where the sum over beads is replaced by a contour integral . For L / D 5 1 , that is for spherical host particles , the integral vanishes and the exact result for spheres is recovered from the ﬁrst term in the curly brackets . For ﬁnite sized rods , both coefﬁcients a 1 and a 2 are parameters with respect to which the functional ~ 18 ! should be maximized . A similar trial function for tracer diffusion of rods has been shown to be reasonably accurate . 31 In Ref . 31 , two trial functions have been used : a function similar to Eq . ~ 20 ! , and a more ad - vanced trial function , where the connectedness of the beads within the rods is taken into account . The coefﬁcient a 2 is thereby replaced by an angular and contour - length dependent function , which is taken equal to the ﬁrst terms in a Taylor expansion with respect to these angular variables and the contour length . For the present purpose , this advanced trial function reads ~ with u ˆ z the z component of u ˆ ! , 044905 - 4 Kang etal . J . Chem .

Numerical values for a as a function of p 5 L / D and q 5 L / 2 a , obtained from the advanced trial function , were found to be equal to within an accuracy of about 5 % – 10 % , to the Pade´ approximant , a 5 2 p 2 q 1 1 9 100 ~ p 2 1 ! 1 15 100 ~ q 2 1 ! 1 1 30 ~ q 2 1 ! 2 1 29 50 000 ~ p 2 1 ! ~ q 2 1 ! 2 2 7 50 000 ~ q 2 1 ! 3 1 1 7 5 ~ p 2 1 ! 2 1 4 ~ q 2 1 ! 1 14 25 ~ p 2 1 ! ~ q 2 1 ! 1 57 500 ~ q 2 1 ! 2 1 1 100 ~ p 2 1 ! ~ q 2 1 ! 2 . ~ 24 ! In Fig . 3 , a is plotted as a function of q for various values of p ~ with 1 < q < p ) . This ﬁgure shows the strong variation of a with p and q . Note the very large value of a for large values of p and q ’ 1 . This implies a strong concentration dependence of the long - time self - diffusion coefﬁcient of a tracer sphere with a diameter that is approximately equal to the length of long and thin host rods . Such a strong concen - tration dependence is not due to network formation of the rods , since the present theory is only valid below the overlap concentration . III . THE COLLOIDAL SYSTEMS As tracer spheres we used silica particles ~ with radii 35 , 210 , and 500 nm ! labeled with Rhodamine B and the protein Bovine serum albumin ~ BSA ! ~ radius is 3 . 5 nm ! . The solvent was a 20 mM TRIS / HCl buffer with p H 5 8 . 15 . Most experi - ments are done with 100 mM added NaCl . The ionic strength with added salt is 110 mM , and without added salt 10 mM . The smallest silica particles with a radius of 35 nm were prepared in several steps , leading to a polydispersity that is much less as for a direct Sto¨ber synthesis . First the core of pure silica is synthesized in a microemulsion . 36 This dispersion was then coated with Rhodamine B 5 - isothiocyanate ~ RBITC ! , a layer of about 1 . 5 nm thickness , and then covered with two more silica layers of about the same thickness . 37 For the two largest silica particles with radii of 210 and 500 nm , ﬁrst a Rhodamine - B labeled core was synthesized , which is then coated with a 100 – 200 nm layer of nonﬂuorescent silica according to Ref . 38 , which is a modiﬁcation of the Sto¨ber synthesis . 39 Typical dye contents FIG . 2 .

BSA ~ Serva Feinbiochimica , Germany , product number 11925 , Lot 05185 ! has molecular weight of 66 kDa and a radius of 3 nm . BSA was ﬂuorescently labeled with 5 ~ 6 ! TAMRA - SE @ 5 ~ 6 ! carboxytetramethylrhodamine , succinim - idyl ester # —Sigma - Aldrich , Product number C4759 , Lot 100 k 1600 . The dye was connected to the N terminus of the protein chain using a standard procedure . After the labeling the BSA - TAMRA was puriﬁed from the free dye and the BSA aggregates using a Sephadex G - 75 column . The bacteriophage fd is a rodlike molecule with a con - tour length of L 5 880 nm , a bare diameter of D 5 6 . 6 nm , a persistence length of P 5 2200 nm , a molecular weight of M 5 1 . 64 3 10 7 g / mol , and an effective density of 10 e / nm in water at p H 5 8 . 15 . 40 The fd virus was grown and puriﬁed following standard biochemical protocols 41 using the XL 1 blue strain of E . coli as the host bacteria . The standard yield is ca . 15 mg of fd per liter of infected bacteria , and virus is typically grown in 6 l batches . The virus particles were pu - riﬁed by repeated centrifugation ( 10 5 g for 5 h ! and ﬁnally redispersed in a 20 mM TRIS - HCl buffer at p H 8 . 15 with 100 mM NaCl to screen the electrostatic interactions . The buffer contributes about 10 mM to the total ionic strength . In order to compare experiments with theory , we have to deﬁne the thickness of the rods and the radii of the spheres . The Debye length for the TRIS / HCl buffer with added salt is about 0 . 9 nm . For the larger spheres , where no salt is added , the Debye screening length is 3 . 0 nm . These screening lengths are so small that DLVO theory is probably not appli - cable anymore . The effective thickness of charged rods as proposed in Refs . 42 and 43 is therefore questionable . It turns out that a correction of the thickness of the rods does not signiﬁcantly affect the comparison between experiment and theory : an increase of the effective thickness of the rods decreases a ~ see Fig . 3 ! and increases the volume fraction . It turns out that the product aw is relatively insensitive to cor - rections of the thickness of the rods . We shall therefore sim - ply use the bare thickness of the rods in comparing experi - ment to theory . In addition , the effective radii of the spheres ~ except possibly for BSA ! is not much different from their bare radii . The aspect ratio of the fd rods is therefore taken equal to , p 5 133 . ~ 25 ! Furthermore , from the molar mass 1 . 64 3 10 7 g / mol , it fol - lows that the volume fraction w of rods can be obtained from the weight concentration c in units mg / ml as , w 5 ~ 1 . 10 3 10 2 3 ! c 3 @ mg / ml # . ~ 26 ! These two relations allow the comparison between the theo - retical predictions of Sec . III and experiments in Sec . V . IV . EXPERIMENTAL METHODS Depending on the size of the tracer spheres , different methods must be applied to measure the long - time self - diffusion coefﬁcient . As will turn out , ﬂuorescence correla - tion spectroscopy ~ FCS ! can only be used for sufﬁciently small tracer spheres . For larger spheres , the diffusion coefﬁ - cient as measured with FCS is somewhere in between the long - time and short - time diffusion coefﬁcient . Dynamic light scattering ~ DLS ! can be used when the tracer spheres scatter as least 10 – 20 times as much as the host rods . This limits the use of DLS to sufﬁciently large spheres . For very large spheres , however , the scattering angles that should be probed are outside the experimental window where accurate mea - surements can be done . In addition , the scattered intensity of the host rods dramatically increases at such small scattering angles . For such very large spheres , video microscopy is the more appropriate method to measure self - diffusion coefﬁ - cients . In this section we shall discuss FCS , DLS , and video microscopy in some detail . A . Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy In ﬂuorescence correlation spectroscopy a single laser beam is strongly focussed , and the ﬂuorescent intensity from a region around the focal point ~ the so - called ‘‘confocal vol - ume’’ ! is probed . The detected intensity distribution within the confocal volume is well described by a Gaussian proﬁle , I 0 ~ r ! ; exp $ 2 ~ x 2 1 y 2 ! / 2 s 12 % exp $ 2 z 2 / 2 s 22 % , ~ 27 ! where s 1 and s 2 measure the width of the confocal volume in the plane perpendicular to the propagation of the beam and its height along the propagation direction , respectively . Typically , s 1 ’ 200 nm , and s 2 ’ 800 nm . The ﬂuorescent intensity is equal to , I f ~ t ! ; E d r I 0 ~ r ! c d ~ r , t ! , ~ 28 ! where c d is the local concentration of ﬂuorescent dye mol - ecules , which are ~ at least in part ! attached to the colloidal spheres . The time dependence of the ﬂuorescent intensity is entirely due to Brownian motion of spheres in and out of the confocal volume . What is neglected in Eq . ~ 28 ! is the depen - dence of excitation probabilities and ﬂuorescent intensities FIG . 3 . a as obtained from the advanced trial function as a function of q 5 L / 2 a for various values of the rod aspect ratio p 5 L / D , as indicated in the ﬁgure , for 1 < q < p @ see Eq . ~ 4 ! # . The fd rods used in the experiments have an aspect ratio of 133 ~ see Sec . III ! . The size ratios for the tracer spheres used in our experiments are indicated . 044905 - 6 Kang etal . J . Chem .

This is probably a good approximation when there are many dye molecules with ran - dom orientations attached to the colloidal particles . In a FCS experiment , the ﬂuorescent intensity correlation function C f ( t ) [ ^ I f ( t ) I f ( t 5 0 ) & is measured , where the brackets ^ ﬂ & refer to ensemble averaging . From Eq . ~ 28 ! it is found that , C f ~ t ! 5 E d r E d r 8 I 0 ~ r ! I 0 ~ r 8 ! ^ c d ~ r , t ! c d ~ r 8 , t 5 0 ! & ; E d k E d k 8 I 0 ~ k ! I 0 ~ k 8 ! ^ c d ~ k , t ! c d ~ k 8 , t 5 0 ! & . ~ 29 ! Here , k - and k 8 - dependent functions are understood to be spatial Fourier transforms with respect to r and r 8 , respec - tively . Now suppose that there is at most a single ﬂuorescent colloidal particle inside the confocal volume . The Fourier transform of the dye concentration c d can then be written as , c d ~ k , t ! 5 B f ~ k ! exp $ i k (cid:149) r c ~ t ! % , where B f ~ k ! 5 E V 0 ~ t ! d r x d ~ r ! exp $ i k (cid:149) r % . ~ 30 ! Here , r c is the position coordinate ~ the position of the center - of - mass ! of the colloidal particle , B f is referred to as the ‘‘ﬂuorescence amplitude , ’’ with V 0 the volume occupied by the colloidal sphere with its center of mass at the origin ~ as indicated by the subscript ‘‘0’’ ! , and x d ( r ) is the character - istic function for the dye on the surface and within the core of the colloidal particle @ x d ( r ) 5 1 when there is a dye mol - ecule at r , and 5 0 otherwise # . Note that the ﬂuorescence amplitude in Eq . ~ 30 ! is time independent when the distribu - tion of ﬂuorescent dye is spherically symmetric . For transla - tionally invariant systems ~ with d the delta distribution ! and in the long - time limit , one has , ^ c d ~ k , t ! c d ~ k 8 , t 5 0 ! & ; d ~ k 1 k 8 ! @ B ~ k ! # 2 ^ exp $ i k (cid:149) @ r c ~ t ! 2 r c ~ t 5 0 ! # % & 5 d ~ k 1 k 8 ! @ B ~ k ! # 2 exp $ 2 D s k 2 t % , ~ 31 ! where D s is the long - time self - diffusion coefﬁcient . This ex - pression is valid when the tracer particle resides in the con - focal volume for sufﬁciently long times , such that long - time diffusive behavior is attained . It thus follows from Eq . ~ 29 ! that , C f ~ t ! ; E d k I 02 ~ k ! u B f ~ k ! u 2 exp $ 2 D s k 2 t % . ~ 32 ! Note that the ensemble average in Eq . ~ 32 ! for the ﬂuores - cence autocorrelation function is a k - weighted average of the electric ﬁeld autocorrelation function that is measured in a dynamic light scattering experiment . Assuming small spheres , such that u B ( k ) u 2 ’ 1 for the wave vectors of interest in the integral in Eq . ~ 32 ! , and from the Fourier transform of the confocal intensity in Eq . ~ 27 ! , it follows by integration that , C f ~ t ! ; F 1 1 D s t s 1 2 G 2 1 F 1 1 D s t s 2 2 G 2 1 / 2 . ~ 33 ! The ﬂuorescent intensity autocorrelation function thus de - cays algebraically with time , with two characteristic time constants s 1 , 2 2 / D s . The geometrical constants s 1 , 2 can be determined from a measurement of a dilute system where D s is equal to the Einstein diffusion constant , that can be ob - tained independently from dynamic light scattering . When the particles are not small , the ﬂuorescent inten - sity is nonzero already when the outer part of a particle en - ters the confocal volume . At that moment the center of the colloid is still outside the confocal volume . In such cases the k dependence of the ﬂuorescence amplitudes in Eq . ~ 32 ! comes into play . For homogeneously labeled spheres , u B ( k ) u can be represented quite accurately by a Gaussian ; exp $ 2 0 . 11 k 2 a 2 % , up to wave vectors where B ( k ) is small enough that it does not contribute anymore to the integral over k . Here , a is the radius of the spherical colloidal par - ticle . We thus obtain the ‘‘effective size’’ of the confocal volume as s 1 , 2 eff 5 A s 1 , 2 2 1 0 . 22 a 2 . This effective increase of the confocal volume quantiﬁes the ﬁnite ﬂuorescent intensity before the center of the sphere actually entered the confocal volume . Experimental correlation functions show some features that we have not discussed above . First of all , in the various steps taken in the above analysis , prefactors are always omit - ted . It turns out , by including all prefactors , that the propor - tionality constant in Eq . ~ 33 ! is equal to 1 / @ the average num - ber of ﬂuorescent colloidal particles in the confocal volume # . This reﬂects the relative decrease of number ﬂuctuations in a given volume with increase of volume . Second , there may be free dye molecules , not attached to colloidal particles , in the solvent . When this is the case , there is a second , additive contribution of the form ~ 33 ! , except that the time constants are much smaller than those for the colloidal particles . Free dye is therefore seen only at very small times . Third , dye molecules that are excited in long lived triplet states , do not contribute to the ﬂuorescent intensity and therefore tempo - rarily reduce the number of ﬂuorescent dye molecules . Trip - let state excitation can thus be regarded as ‘‘reversible bleaching . ’’ The relative amplitude of such contributions depends on the sort of dye that is used , as well as the con - centration of dye on the surface and / or inside the core of a colloidal particle . For our samples , triplet state contributions were found to be very small . In addition , these very small triplet contributions decay on a time scale that is orders of magnitude faster than the diffusion times of the colloidal spheres . The above analysis is a simpliﬁed version of a more elaborate analysis in Ref . 44 . Overviews of FCS and its ap - plication to biological systems can be found in Refs . 45 – 49 . An extensive literature list can be found on the FCS website of Zeiss . B . Dynamic light scattering In order to verify whether the true long - time limit of the tracer diffusion coefﬁcient is measured in the FCS experi - 044905 - 7 Diffusion of spheres in crowded suspensions of rods J . Chem . Phys . 122 , 044905 ( 2005 ) Downloaded 21 Dec 2006 to 134 . 94 . 122 . 39 .

For tracer systems , dynamic light scattering can be used to measure the entire time dependence of the mean - squared dis - placement , allowing for an unambiguous determination of the long - time limit of the self - diffusion coefﬁcient . The nec - essary condition to probe self - diffusion of the spheres is that the scattered intensity of the rods is very much smaller than that of the spheres , and that the concentration of the spheres is so low that a sphere does not interact with other spheres . This limits the applicability of dynamic light scattering to intermediate sized spheres , for radii a in the range 50 nm , a , 500 nm . For smaller spheres the scattered intensity of the rods can no longer be neglected . For larger spheres the scattered intensity for typical experimentally accessible scat - tering angles is also too small as compared to the scattered intensity by the rods , while extrapolations must be done from relatively small scattering angles . The procedure to obtain the time - dependent mean - squared displacement from dynamic light scattering data is as follows ~ see , for example , Refs . 50 and 51 ! . When the intensity of the tracer spheres dominates and the spheres do not mutually interact , the measured normalized electric ﬁeld autocorrelation function g 1 ( k , t ) is equal to , g 1 ~ k , t ! 5 ^ exp $ i k (cid:149) @ r ~ t ! 2 r ~ 0 ! # % & , ~ 34 ! where k is the scattered wavevector and r ( t ) is position of a tracer sphere at time t . For translationally and rotationally invariant systems , an expansion with respect to small wave vectors leads to , g 1 ~ k , t ! 5 exp H 2 1 6 W ~ t ! k 2 1 ‘‘ O ~ k 4 ! ’’ J , ~ 35 ! where , W ~ t ! 5 ^ u r ~ t ! 2 r ~ 0 ! u 2 & [ 6 D s ~ t ! t , ~ 36 ! is the mean - squared displacement . The second equation de - ﬁnes the time - dependent self - diffusion coefﬁcient . The long - time self - diffusion coefﬁcient is the long - time limit of D s ( t ) , which is obtained from the slope of W ( t ) as a function of t at sufﬁciently large times . Hence , plotting 2 6 ln $ g 1 ( k , t ) % / k 2 for a given time as a function of k 2 , and extrapolating to k 5 0 , yields W ( t ) for the particular time under consideration . Typi - cally this procedure is applied for about 50 linearly spaced times . The long - time self - diffusion coefﬁcient D s then fol - lows from dW ( t ) / dt 5 6 D s for times much larger than typi - cal microstructural relaxation times of the host rods . C . Video microscopy For video microscopy we used the method described in Refs . 52 and 53 . Video Microscopy is used for the 500 nm spheres , with a Carl Zeiss AxioCam camera and AxioVison 3 . 0 software to measure particle coordinates . The was Carl Zeiss plan - apochromat 20 X , N . A . 0 . 75 , and 256 3 324 pixels black and white enhanced gain contrast TIFF image formats are stored in real time for 100 consecutive shots . The size of a pixel is 0 . 260 m m while frames were recorded at a speed of 0 . 23 s per frame with the exposure time of the camera in the range 4 – 7 ms . The samples are contained in a microslide ~ VITRO Dynamics Inc . Cat . No . 3520 ! , with a thickness of 200 m m . The focus is in the middle of the cuvette to avoid the effects of interactions with the walls . An IDL particle - tracking program is used to calculate mean squared displace - ments as functions of time from two - dimensional ~ 2D ! im - ages . V . EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS Four different tracer particles have been used , with radii 500 , 210 , 35 , and 3 nm . Depending on the size of these spheres , suitable techniques to measure long - time self - diffusion coefﬁcients are video microscopy , DLS , and FCS . For the 500 nm spheres we used video microscopy to mea - sure the long - time self - diffusion coefﬁcient , for the 210 and 35 nm spheres both DLS and FCS were employed , while the 3 nm spheres we used FCS . The suitability of DLS depends on the ratio of the scattered light by the tracer spheres and host rods , and the accessible wave vector range . This limits the suitability of DLS to the 210 and 35 nm particles : the 3 nm particles do not scatter enough as compared to the fd rods to prepare a tracer system , while the form factor of the 500 nm spheres goes to zero within a too small wave vector range to be able to do the extrapolation to zero wave vector , as discussed before . For the 210 nm spheres extrapolations are done from the scattering angle range 15° – 60° , and for the 35 nm particles from 25° – 120° in steps of 5° , where two independent measurements are averaged . FCS is difﬁcult to perform for the 500 nm , since the number density at a given low volume fraction is low and diffusion through the confo - cal volume takes a relatively long time . As will become clear in the following , the combination of the three techniques is a fertile combination in order to study long - time diffusive behavior over a large range of tracer particle radii . An overview of the tracer sphere sizes and the applied techniques is given in the table . Diffusion coefﬁcients as measured by means of FCS cannot always be identiﬁed as long - time diffusion coefﬁ - cients . This is illustrated in Fig . 4 , where both the long - and short - time diffusion coefﬁcients as obtained from DLS and diffusion coefﬁcients obtained from FCS are plotted as func - tions of the fd concentration . Clearly , for small fd concentra - tions FCS measures short - time diffusion , whereas for high fd concentrations the FCS diffusion coefﬁcient seems to be - come equal to the long - time diffusion coefﬁcient . The reason that FCS does not measure long - time diffusion can be seen from Fig . 5 ~ a ! , where the mean squared displacement of the 210 nm spheres as obtained from DLS experiments is plotted for various fd concentrations . As can be seen , the mean TABLE I . Overview of tracer sphere sizes , applied methods , and experi - mental versus theoretical values for a .

The linear dimensions of the confocal volume @ as deﬁned by the param - eters s 1 , 2 in Eq . ~ 27 ! # are s 1 ’ 0 . 2 m m and s 2 ’ 0 . 8 m m . Hence , the minimum mean - squared displacement to reach the long - time diffusive limit is of the order of the squared linear dimension of the confocal volume . A 210 nm tracer sphere therefore diffuses through the confocal volume with - out reaching its long - time limit . FCS then measures the short - time diffusion coefﬁcient ~ similar considerations con - cerning FCS measurements can be found in Ref . 16 ! . For higher fd concentration , long - time diffusive behavior is reached for a mean - squared displacement of ; 0 . 01 m m 2 , which is small compared to the squared linear dimension of the confocal volume , so that FCS now probes long - time dif - fusive motion . As can be seen from Fig . 5 ~ c ! , where the mean - squared displacement is plotted for the 35 nm spheres , the long - time limit is reached for much smaller displace - ments for all concentrations , so that FCS probes long - time diffusion for these smaller spheres ~ FCS and DLS long - time data are indeed shown in Fig . 7 to coincide ! . This will also be the case then for the 3 nm spheres . Figures 5 ~ b ! and 5 ~ c ! show mean squared displacements for a shorter time interval , which allows for the determination of short - time diffusion coefﬁcients . Note that in Fig . 4 short - time self diffusion is found to be much less hindered by the rods as compared to long - time diffusion , in accordance to what has been found in Refs . 14 and 15 . Short - time rotational diffusion , however , is affected by the rods in a way that is comparable to long - time trans - lational diffusion . 15 Mean - squared displacements and diffusion coefﬁcients as a function of fd concentration of the 500 nm spheres as obtained from video microscopy are given in Figs . 6 ~ a ! and 6 ~ b ! , respectively . Mean - squared displacements are averages over 15 tracer spheres . Note the relatively large value of the mean - squared displacement before long - time diffusive be - havior is found . Here , FCS would probably probe short - time diffusion for all fd concentrations . The dotted line in Fig . 6 ~ a ! is the predicted slope from Eqs . ~ 1 ! and ~ 24 ! . As can be seen , the theoretical prediction is in accordance with the ex - periments . For the smaller spheres , the predicted slope is about a factor of 2 – 3 smaller than the experimental slope : see the dotted lines in Figs . 4 and 7 . The table contains an overview of the experimentally obtained values a exp for the slope a and the value a theor as predicted by theory . The dis - crepancy between experiment and theory for the smaller par - ticles is probably due to the neglect of hydrodynamic inter - actions in our theory . Hydrodynamic interactions of the FIG . 4 .

Long - time diffusion coefﬁcients as functions of fd con - centration for the various tracer spheres are collected in Fig . 7 . All ﬁlled symbols relate to high salt concentration ~ 20 mM TRIS 1 100 mM NaCl ! , while the open symbols for the 35 nm spheres are measured at low salt concentration ~ 20 mM TRIS without adding salt ! . As can be seen , there is no dif - ference between high and low salt for the 35 nm spheres , so that the hard core limit at these salt concentrations is reached for these spheres , and also for the larger spheres . In view of the fact that the Debye length at high salt is about 0 . 9 nm , the 3 nm spheres are also expected to behave as hard spheres . The large spheres were found to be unstable at high salt concentration . The Debye length at low salt is so small in comparison to 500 nm , that these spheres most probably also behave as hard spheres . The two types of open symbols for the 35 nm spheres relate to two concentrations of tracer spheres , complying with volume fractions of 8 . 5 3 10 2 4 ~ ^ ! and 1 . 3 3 10 2 3 ~ s ! . As can be seen , the volume fraction of the spheres is small enough to neglect mutual interactions , so that true self diffusion is measured . The volume fraction of tracer spheres was less than 1 . 0 3 10 2 3 for all other samples . On various occasions we referred to diffusion of small tracer spheres as diffusion through the meshes of a network spanned by the fd rods . There are three parameters of impor - tance for diffusion of spheres through networks : ~ i ! the size ratio a / j , where j is the mesh size of the network , ~ ii ! the size ratio a / D , and ~ iii ! the dynamical properties of the net - work itself which couples to the motion of the sphere . When a / D is large and the dynamics of the network is insigniﬁcant for diffusion of the tracer sphere , D s / D 0 should be a func - tion of the single parameter a / j . For cross - linked networks , it has been shown experimentally for various kinds of sys - tems , that D s / D 0 indeed scales with a / j . Except for a mode coupling approach that is valid only in the vicinity of the isotropic - nematic phase transition , 29 , 30 the existing theories 25 – 28 treat diffusion of spheres in rod networks with the neglect of the dynamics of the network itself . In that case this scaling is also predicted by theory . Scaling with a / j is not found for fd - virus suspensions , as can be seen from Fig . 8 . 54 Even for the two tracer spheres for which a / D is large , there is no scaling . This implies that the dynamics of the network is responsible for the absence of scaling . Failure of such a scaling is also found for diffusion in suspensions of ‘‘living polymers’’ . 14 In this reference , the modiﬁed scaling relation D s / D 0 5 ( h 0 / h ) @ 1 1 600 ( j / a ) 6 # is postulated ~ where h 0 is the shear viscosity of pure solvent , and h is the stationary zero - shear viscosity of the suspension of living polymer ! . This relation ﬁts experimental results for two dif - ferent tracer sphere sizes in Ref . 14 ~ 250 and 500 nm ! . For very large spheres , D s / D 0 5 h 0 / h , as it should . However , for very small tracer spheres one should have D s / D 0 ’ 1 . The long - time self - diffusion coefﬁcient in Fig . 7 for the small particles is indeed seen to be very weakly depending on the fd concentration . The empirical modiﬁed scaling rela - tion does not comply with the latter limiting behavior . A theory for diffusion of spheres through dynamical networks is still lacking . The variational approach discussed above may be a way to develop such a theory . VI . SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION The systematic study of long - time self - diffusion of tracer spheres in fd - rod dispersions has been possible by combining various experimental techniques , FCS ~ for small tracers ! , DLS ~ for intermediate sized tracers ! , and video microscopy ~ for large tracers ! . For larger spheres , it is shown that FCS does not measure long - time self - diffusion . DLS experiments show that this is due to the fact that the tracer sphere diffuses through the confocal volume in a time interval that is too short to attain long - time limiting diffusive behavior . Long - time self - diffusion of spherical tracers in rod dis - persions is found to strongly depend on the size of the spheres relative to the length of the rods . This strong size dependence is not the result of stronger hinderance of motion of the tracer by a network formed by the rods , but is already evident below the overlap concentration , where the tracer sphere predominantly interacts with mutually uncorrelated FIG . 7 .

For the smaller spheres , the theoretical slope is a factor of 2 – 3 smaller than the experimentally found slope . This is probably due to the neglect of hydrody - namic interactions between the tracer sphere and the rods , which become relatively more important as compared to di - rect interactions for such smaller spheres . For concentrations of rods much higher than the overlap concentration , diffusion can be discussed in terms of diffu - sion through a network which is characterized by a certain mesh size j . The few theories that exist , however , neglect the dynamics of the network and assume the existence of perma - nent cross links between the rods or describe the network as a porous medium . In that case D s is predicted to be a func - tion of the size ratio a / j ~ with a the radius of the tracer sphere and j the mesh size ! . This kind of scaling is indeed found in experiments on cross - linked networks . These theo - ries , however , do not incorporate spatial inhomogeneities of the cross - linked network , which gives rise to the experimen - tally found anomalous diffusive behavior . The network spanned by the fd rods is a dynamical network , where the rods are not cross linked to each other . A strong deviation from scaling with a / j is found in the present experiments . It follows that the dynamics of the fd - rod network itself is very important . So far , there is no theory that takes such network dynamics into account . The variational approach developed here might be extended to diffusion through a dynamical network of rods . ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors thank N . A . M . Verhaegh , C . M . van Kats , and G .

APPENDIX A : DERIVATION OF THE EXPLICIT FORM OF THE FUNCTIONAL Some of the mathematical steps involved to arrive at Eq . ~ 18 ! for the functional in Eq . ~ 17 ! will be outlined in this appendix . First introduce the separation R 5 R 1 2 R 2 between the centers of the sphere and a rod in units of the thickness D of the rod . Substitution of the deﬁnitions of the operators yields ( V is the volume of the system and (cid:147) is the gradient operator with respect to R ! , ^ C u L ˆ B ~ 0 !

(cid:149) uˆuˆ (cid:149)(cid:147) C 1 e r ~ R ˆ 2 b @ R ˆ V # ! (cid:149) R ˆ C J . ~ A1 ! Using Gauss’s integral theorem and using that P eq ; exp $ 2 b V % , it is easily veriﬁed that , E d R P eq C (cid:147)(cid:149)(cid:147) C 52 E d R P eq $ u (cid:147) C u 2 1 bC @ (cid:147) C # (cid:149) @ (cid:147) V # % , ~ A2 ! so that the integral corresponding to the ﬁrst term within the curly brackets in the integrand in Eq . ~ A1 ! is found to be equal to , E d R P eq C ~ (cid:147) 2 b @ (cid:147) V # ! (cid:149)(cid:147) C 52 E d R P eq u (cid:147) C u 2 . ~ A3 ! The integral corresponding to the second term is reduced similarly as , E d R P eq C ~ (cid:147) 2 b @ (cid:147) V # ! (cid:149) uˆuˆ (cid:149)(cid:147) C 52 E d R P eq u uˆ (cid:149)(cid:147) C u 2 . ~ A4 ! The last integral can be treated similarly , using that , R d uˆ R ˆ ~ ﬂ ! 5 0 , ~ A5 ! which is a direct consequence of Stokes’s theorem . It follows from this theorem , similar to Eq . ~ A2 ! , that , R d uˆ P eq C R ˆ (cid:149) R ˆ C 52 R d uˆ P eq @ u R ˆ C u 2 1 bC @ R ˆ C # (cid:149) @ R ˆ V # # , ~ A6 ! and hence , similar to Eq . ~ A3 ! , R d uˆ P eq C ~ R ˆ 2 b @ R ˆ V # ! (cid:149) R ˆ C 52 R d uˆ P eq u R ˆ C u 2 . ~ A7 ! The bilinear contribution ~ A1 ! to the functional can thus be written as , ^ C u L ˆ B ~ 0 !

P eq & 52 2 e VD 3 eˆ 3 (cid:149) E d R R d uˆ C (cid:147) P eq , ~ A9 ! where eˆ 3 5 ( 0 , 0 , 1 ) . Since P eq is a constant , independent of R for R > ( L 1 2 a ) / 2 D , the integral with respect to R does not extend beyond R 5 ( L 1 2 a ) / 2 D . Hence , applying Gauss’s integral theorem , E d R C (cid:147) P eq 52 E R , ~ L 1 2 a ! / 2 D d R P eq (cid:147) C 1 S L 1 2 a 2 D D 2 R R 5 ~ L 1 2 a ! / 2 D d RˆRˆ C P eq , ~ A10 ! where r d Rˆ ( ﬂ ) denotes integration over the angular coor - dinates of R over a spherical surface with radius R 5 ( L 1 2 a ) / 2 D , and Rˆ 5 R / R . Substitution into Eq . ~ A9 ! , thus leads to , 2 ^ C u @ P eq # 2 1 L ˆ ~ 1 !

Apart from the irrelevant prefactor VD 3 P eq / x 5 D 3 / 4 p V , this reproduces the expression in Eq . ~ 18 ! @ note that x 5 1 for R 5 ( L 1 2 a ) / 2 D ] . APPENDIX B : DERIVATION OF EQ . (cid:132) 23 (cid:133) The ensemble average of the pair - interaction potential in Eq . ~ 6 ! for the stationary velocity of the tracer sphere is equal to , N ^ „ 1 V & 5 NVD 2 E d R R d uˆ P „ 1 V , ~ B1 ! where , as before , distances are expressed in units of the thickness D of the rods . Substitution of Eq . ~ 12 ! , using that for hard - core interactions „ 1 x 52 bx„ 1 V and that the vol - ume fraction w of end - capped rods is equal to , w 5 p 4 D 2 L S 1 2 D 3 L D , ~ B2 ! thus leads to , N ^ „ 1 V & 52 w p 2 p S 1 2 1 3 p D F ext E d R R d uˆ C„ 1 x . ~ B3 ! Next consider the ensemble averaged Brownian force in Eq . ~ 6 ! . From Eq . ~ 12 ! it is immediately found that , Nk B T ^ „ 1 ln $ P % & 5 w p 2 p S 1 2 1 3 p D F ext E d R R d uˆ $ C„ 1 x 1 x„ 1 C % . ~ B4 ! The ﬁrst term in the curly brackets cancels against the aver - age potential energy in Eq . ~ B3 ! . Hence , the magnitude of the ensemble averaged velocity is equal to , ^ v & 5 b D 0 F ext F 1 2 w p 2 p S 1 2 1 3 p D E d R R d uˆ x ] ] Z C G . ~ B5 ! where it is used that the ensemble averaged velocity is along the z direction . The effective friction coefﬁcient g 5 F ext / ^ v & follows immediately from this expression , from which the long - time self - diffusion D s 5 k B T / g follows as , D s 5 D 0 F 1 2 w p 2 p S 1 2 1 3 p D E d R R d uˆ x ] ] Z C G . ~ B6 ! Using Gauss’s integral theorem in order to transform the vol - ume integral to integrals with a bounded integration range @ like in Eq . ~ A10 ! in Appendix A , which is handy for numeri - cal integration # ﬁnally leads to Eq . ~ 23 ! . 1 S .
