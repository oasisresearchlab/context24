Journal : Nat Biotechnol Publication Year : 2009 Authors : Robert L Judson , Joshua E Babiarz , Monica Venere , Robert Blelloch PubMed link : 19363475 Funding Grants : MicroRNA Regulation of Human Embryonic Stem Cell Self - Renewal and Differentiation Public Summary : Scientific Abstract : This report demonstrates that introduction of microRNAs ( miRNAs ) specific to embryonic stem cells enhances the production of mouse induced pluripotent stem ( iPS ) cells . The miRNAs miR - 291 - 3p , miR - 294 and miR - 295 increase the efficiency of reprogramming by Oct4 , Sox2 and Klf4 , but not by these factors plus cMyc . cMyc binds the promoter of the miRNAs , suggesting that they are downstream effectors of cMyc during reprogramming . However , unlike cMyc , the miRNAs induce a homogeneous population of iPS cell colonies . 1
