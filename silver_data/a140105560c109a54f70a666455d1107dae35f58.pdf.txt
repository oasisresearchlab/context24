The departure of key employees leads to leakages of valuable technological know - how to competitors , who could beneﬁt from such knowledge without incurring the costs of creating it ( Agarwal , Ganco , and Ziedonis , 2009 ; Shaver and Flyer , 2000 ) . Thus , companies frequently use non - competition contractual agreements ( hereafter , non - competes ) to prevent employees from joining a competitor or forming a new company ( e . g . , Holley , 1998 ; Kaplan and Stromberg , 2003 ) . Consider the case of Kai - Fu - Lee , a renowned computer scientist and technology executive who worked on revolution - ary speech recognition technology for Microsoft . Keywords : appropriability ; R & D strategy ; innovation ; technological breakthroughs ; non - competition agree - ments * Correspondence to : Raffaele Conti , Catolica Lisbon School of Business and Economics , Palma de Cima , 1649 – 023 Lisbon , Portugal . E - mail : raffaele . conti @ ucp . pt Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . In 2005 , he joined Google , and Microsoft immediately went to a court in Washington , D . C . , to enforce its non - compete contract with him . The court eventually issued a restraining order , forbid - ding Lee from working on projects for Google that were similar to those he performed for Microsoft . The protection granted by non - competes might change the very nature of ﬁrm R & D strategy if companies choose R & D characteristics that enable them to avoid or minimize the costs due to outbound mobility ( Zhao , 2006 ) . This idea echoes the words of Brian Halligan , CEO of Hubspot , who calls his company ‘super entrepreneurial’ in its persistent development of novel technological solutions , which occur precisely because the non - competes that employees sign ‘encourage new thought about the way Hubspot does business’ ( Psaty , 2010 ) . Thus , non - competes likely affect ﬁrms’ choices to follow risky but high - potential technological trajectories . The decision to commit resources to a safe or risky R & D path has important implications for the stream of corporate returns and , therefore , has been extensively inves - tigated in previous research ( e . g . , Cabral , 2003 ; Henderson , 1993 ; March , 1991 ) . The role played Non - Competition Agreements and Firm R & D Riskiness 1231 by things like non - competes , which can determine the knowledge appropriability regime , has been largely neglected , though . I propose that ﬁrms choose their degree of R & D riskiness according to the extent of non - compete enforcement they con - front . Speciﬁcally , I argue that mobility - induced knowledge leakages imply that the ﬁrm shares its proﬁts , but not its losses , from R & D with rivals . Therefore , a stronger enforcement of non - competes should make high - risk R & D projects relatively more valuable than low - risk ones , such that in regions in which non - competes are enforced more strictly , ﬁrms likely undertake R & D paths whose outcomes have a higher probability of being both extremely valuable ( i . e . , breakthroughs ) and extremely poor ( i . e . , failures ) . Moreover , to the extent that non - competes create incentives to undertake riskier R & D paths , they also affect the direction of research efforts and induce ﬁrms to undertake projects in new technological areas . To test this prediction , I have gathered data on U . S . patent applications by public companies from 1990 to 2000 . I identify the impact of non - competes by considering longitudinal variation in U . S . non - compete enforcement . The ﬁndings indi - cate that in states where non - compete enforce - ment becomes stricter , companies choose riskier R & D paths , such that corporate inventions are more likely to lie in the tails of the inventions’ value distribution ( as breakthroughs or failures ) and appear in novel technological areas . Accord - ingly , this study provides several contributions to strategy literature . First , this work contributes to the growing stream of research into the relationship between business activity and the institutional context ( e . g . , Furman , 2003 ; Ingram and Silverman , 2002 ; Pe’er and Gottschalg , 2011 ) . This link is of central interest to practitioners , especially because gov - ernment policies , such as those that I investigate , are more likely to affect companies’ economic values than actions by any other group of stake - holders , except customers . In addition , govern - ment impacts are expected to increase ( McKinsey Global Survey , 2010 ) . In this respect , I show how a ﬁrm’s R & D strategy depends strongly on the institutional environment in which it is embedded . Second , this study clariﬁes how the impact of knowledge leakages on ﬁrm proﬁtability varies with ﬁrm characteristics . Shaver and Flyer ( 2000 ) argue that unintended knowledge spillovers to competitors are asymmetric with respect to the quality of ﬁrm technologies ; losses are higher for ﬁrms that possess better technologies . In an extension of their contribution , this work theorizes that mobility - induced knowledge leakages are asymmetric with respect to the riskiness of the ﬁrm’s R & D strategy , in that losses are higher for ﬁrms that pursue riskier research projects . Third , in the framework of strategic entrepreneurship literature , this study points out that non - competes , though they reduce the formation of new companies ( e . g . , Samila and Sorenson , 2011 ) , might stimulate corporate entrepreneurship by encouraging managers to explore novel and potentially pathbreaking tech - nological solutions . From a policy perspective , non - competition agreements , thus , may cre - ate , at the regional level , a trade - off between entrepreneurship and intrapreneurship . Fourth , the study extends a growing stream of research that examines the determinants of inventive breakthroughs ( e . g . , Ahuja and Lam - pert , 2001 ; Fleming and Singh , 2010 ; Phene , Fladmoe - Lindquist , and Marsch , 2005 ) . Interest in breakthroughs is mainly motivated by the skewed distribution of inventions’ value , such that a small minority of inventions account for a dispropor - tionate share of value ( Gambardella , Harhoff , and Verspagen , 2008 ) . In this context , non - competes enhance the likelihood that any inventive outcome will be extremely proﬁtable . BACKGROUND AND THEORY DEVELOPMENT Non - competes , appropriability , and the incentive to invest in R & D For ﬁrms competing in knowledge - intensive industries , a key strategic problem involves capturing the value created by investing in R & D and limiting unintended knowledge leaks to rivals ( Agarwal et al . , 2009 ; Shaver and Flyer , 2000 ) . If proprietary knowledge cannot be protected at all and complementary assets are freely available , innovative ﬁrms suffer a constant disadvantage ; competitors simply imitate their knowledge without incurring the costs of creating it . Thus , companies use different mechanisms to limit unin - tended knowledge spillovers to rivals ( Levin et al . , 1987 ) , including protections granted by patent or Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . Strat . Mgmt . J . , 35 : 1230 – 1248 ( 2014 ) DOI : 10 . 1002 / smj 1232 R . Conti copyright laws . Tacit knowledge can also be pro - tected by embedding it in organizational practices and routines ( Nelson and Winter , 1982 ) . Yet some knowledge may be inherent to individual members of the organization , in which case it is difﬁcult to share throughout the organization . The most effec - tive way ﬁrms can retain such knowledge is by restricting the possibility of employees leaving the company , such as through non - competes . These non - competes signiﬁcantly limit outbound mobil - ity to competitors ( Garmaise , 2011 ; Marx , Strum - sky , and Fleming , 2009 ) and are widely used in contracts with scientists , engineers , and technology executives . In the United States , almost 70 percent of entrepreneurs receiving venture capital ﬁnanc - ing are required to sign non - competition clauses by the venture capital ﬁrms ( Kaplan and Stromberg , 2003 ) , and about 80 percent of newly hired IT pro - fessionals are asked to sign non - compete contracts ( Holley , 1998 ) . The historical origins of modern non - competes stem from England . In 1711 , a court allowed partial restraints on workers’ mobility in certain circumstances . This partial restraint logic spread to the United States in the nineteenth century ; by the start of the twentieth century , U . S . courts generally considered non - competes enforceable if they met reasonableness standards . Although most U . S . states , thus , allow some form of non - competition contracts , their enforcement varies substantially . For example , in California , non - compete agreements are not enforceable and in Texas , they are valid only if employees receive some ancillary compensation for entering into them . The geographical reach and duration of a non - compete also varies by jurisdiction . In most states , a non - compete contract cannot specify a time restriction greater than two years , but Pennsylvania courts routinely accept three - year covenants . The social desirability of non - competes remains a topic of debate . On one side , Gilson ( 1999 ) argues that Silicon Valley’s entrepreneurial growth mainly reﬂects California’s proscription of non - competes . Stuart and Sorenson ( 2003 ) conﬁrm that liquidity events , such as acquisitions or initial public offerings , increase the number of new ﬁrms , especially in areas where non - compete covenants are forbidden . And Samila and Sorenson ( 2011 ) show that the positive impact of venture capital on the number of new ﬁrms , inventions , and employment is signiﬁcantly greater in regions that do not enforce non - compete agreements strictly . On the other side , the knowledge protection provided by non - competes may be essential during emergent stages of a new industry to stimulate both entrepreneurship and innovation ( Franco and Mitchell , 2008 ) . Although the macro implications of non - competes for regional growth and performance have been dealt with extensively , their implications for companies’ R & D strategies have been neglected , despite their widespread use in contracts for scientists , engineers , and technology executives . How do non - competes affect company R & D strategy ? Companies might invest more in R & D if non - competes were enforced more strictly . Non - competes encourage ﬁrms to allocate resources to the innovation process because they protect the ﬁrms from the loss of their R & D invest - ments that would ensue if researchers depart . Moreover , R & D investments beneﬁt from the presence of highly skilled researchers , but compa - nies likely spend money developing researchers’ skills only if they can secure their employee human capital within ﬁrm boundaries ( Garmaise , 2011 ) . In contrast , non - competes could decrease ﬁrms’ R & D investment because they prevent competitors from eliciting rents from previ - ous innovations , which reduces the incentive to innovate . Furthermore , fewer mobility - induced knowledge spillovers might diminish the returns to R & D investments to the extent that R & D across ﬁrms becomes complementary . Finally , non - competes can reduce the average quality of the match between an employee and the employer , which likely reduces R & D produc - tivity ( Samila and Sorenson , 2011 ) . Theoreti - cally then , the impact of non - compete agree - ments on the amount of corporate R & D expen - diture is ambiguous . Empirically , it appears to be null ( Garmaise , 2011 ) , which aligns with the results that have been produced by research into the impact of intellectual property rights ( IPR ) on R & D expenditures ( e . g . , Sakakibara and Branstetter , 2001 ) . Therefore , rather than analyzing again the rela - tionship between non - compete enforcement and the sheer amount of company R & D expenditure , I attempt to determine how non - competes affect the type of R & D investments . In particular , I focus on the riskiness of the R & D undertaken by com - panies that operate under different non - compete enforcement regimes . Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . Strat .

Committing ﬁrm resources to a safe versus a risky research path has important implications for corporate returns . Consider , for example , a pharmaceutical ﬁrm that performed research in the antidepressant market in the early 1990s ( see Cabral , 2000 ) . Broadly speaking , it faced a choice of two strategies : ( 1 ) it could invest in developing an antidepressant based on a serotonin inhibitor , a relatively well - known method which would provide a high probability of success but a limited payoff considering the incremental nature of the innovation ; or ( 2 ) it could invest in developing an antidepressant that used a substance P receptor blocker approach . For this relatively risky strategy , which had not been used by previous drugs , there was a signiﬁcant probability of complete failure , but also the promise of a substantial payoff in the case of success : it would represent a radical innovation . Similar R & D riskiness choices for ﬁrms depend on their organizational and environmental charac - teristics , as well as their relative competitive posi - tion . Among the organizational factors , substantial literature suggests that incumbency may hamper a ﬁrm’s incentive and ability to undertake riskier technological trajectories . This is because the research efforts of incumbents seeking to exploit novel and uncertain technological trajectories are signiﬁcantly less productive than those of new entrants ( e . g . , Henderson , 1993 ) . Environmental factors also play important roles . As March ( 1991 ) shows , organizations operating in winner - take - all environments and facing a multitude of rivals likely undertake strategies designed to enhance performance variance , rather than mean perfor - mance . As the number of competitors increases , ‘the contribution of the variance to competitive advantage increases , ’ whereas ‘the mean becomes irrelevant’ ( March 1991 , p . 83 ) . Moreover , in winner - take - all environments , the initial position of the company with respect to competitors mat - ters . Cabral ( 2003 ) argues that market leaders likely invest in safe R & D strategies , whereas mar - ket laggards pursue risky R & D because the latter have a lot to gain from reversing their relative position and little ( or nothing ) to lose from just remaining a laggard . However , previous research has not considered how the decision about R & D riskiness may depend on the appropriability regime faced by companies . That is , ﬁrms cope with potential knowledge leakages by strategically choosing R & D project characteristics that enable them to avoid or minimize the costs of knowledge out - ﬂows to rivals . Zhao ( 2006 ) and Alcacer and Zhao ( 2012 ) ﬁnd that multilocation companies facing appropriability risks usually choose projects characterized by strong linkages with other corporate proprietary knowledge—because this interdependence creates knowledge that is hard for competitors to replicate . The degree of R & D risk - iness provides another characteristic that might minimize knowledge leakages costs because mobility - induced knowledge leakages should have asymmetric impacts on R & D projects of varying riskiness . In particular , the proﬁt decrease should be relatively higher for riskier projects . Hence , by reducing outbound mobility , non - competes may make high - risk R & D projects relatively more valuable . As an illustration , imagine the following sit - uation : two R & D projects have the same ini - tial expected value . The ﬁrst , R & D Project A is safe and produces a positive proﬁt a with prob - ability 1 . The second R & D Project B is risky and generates a positive proﬁt b with a probabil - ity p , but it produces an economic loss L with a probability ( 1 − p ) . In principle , a risk - neutral ﬁrm is indifferent between Projects A and B because they have the same expected value a , that is , a = pb − ( 1 − p ) L . Their preference changes , though , when non - competes are not enforceable because researchers working on a proﬁtable project leave the ﬁrm with probability λ , in which case the company loses a share γ of proﬁts . Its proﬁts decrease but losses do not , so the expected value of the risky Project B , or ( 1 − λγ ) pb − ( 1 − p ) L , falls to below the expected value of the safe Project A , which is ( 1 − λγ ) a . Such reasoning generalizes to projects with varying degrees of riskiness ( see Appendix 1 ) . Therefore , when companies cannot enforce non - competes , a high - risk project becomes less valuable than a low - risk one with the same initial expected value . If ﬁrms pass from a sit - uation in which non - competes are forbidden to one in which the competes can be enforced , their high - risk R & D projects should become relatively more valuable . Using the previous example , with - out non - competes , a risk - neutral company prefers Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . Strat . Mgmt . J . , 35 : 1230 – 1248 ( 2014 ) DOI : 10 . 1002 / smj 1234 R . Conti Project A , but if the possibility of enforcing non - competes exists , it is indifferent between projects . In this case , the non - compete enforcement induces ﬁrms to invest more resources in riskier R & D projects . High - risk projects are more likely to gen - erate technological breakthroughs than low - risk ones . Greater riskiness in the outcome distribu - tion appears preferable in the quest for extremely valuable outcomes ( Fleming , 2007 ; March , 1991 ) because it fattens the right - hand tail of inven - tions’ value distributions , increasing the likelihood of breakthroughs . Yet , greater riskiness implies an increase in the mass of both tails of the distribu - tion . That is , a greater probability of breakthrough outliers is accompanied by a greater probability of dead ends and failures . Therefore , I hypothesize : Hypothesis 1 ( H1 ) : The stricter the enforcement of non - competes , the greater the likelihood that corporate inventions are breakthroughs . Hypothesis 2 ( H2 ) : The stricter the enforcement of non - competes , the greater the likelihood that corporate inventions are failures . The enforcement of non - competes also affects the direction of research endeavors . Firms can choose whether to undertake projects closely related to their preexisting knowledge base or pur - sue projects distant from their current technologi - cal know - how . This choice has implications for the distribution of rewards , in that the exploration of novel technological competences is usually riskier than the exploitation of existing know - how , so ‘compared to returns from exploitation , returns from exploration are systematically less certain’ ( March , 1991 : 73 ) . To the extent that non - competes create incentives to undertake riskier R & D paths , they also affect the direction of research efforts and induce ﬁrms to undertake projects in new techno - logical areas . I hypothesize : Hypothesis 3 ( H3 ) : The stricter the enforcement of non - competes , the greater the likelihood that corporate inventions occur in new technological areas . In summary , stronger enforcement of non - competes should encourage riskier R & D projects whose outcomes have a higher probability of being both breakthroughs and failures . Moreover , stronger non - compete enforcement should lead companies to produce inventions in technologi - cal domains that are distant from their current technological know - how . METHODS Sample and data To investigate how non - compete enforcement affects ﬁrms’ inventive outcomes , I gathered a data set that includes all granted patents whose applications were ﬁled in the United States by a public ﬁrm from 1990 to 2000 . In particular , I focused on patented inventions whose ﬁrst inven - tor resides in a U . S . state ; similar to prior work ( Thompson , 2005 ) , I assigned each patent to the state of residence of the ﬁrst inventor . Information about patents came from the most recent update of the National Bureau of Economic Research ( NBER ) patent database ( www . nber . org / patents ) , which provides citations for all U . S . patents granted from 1976 to 2006 ( Hall , Jaffe , and Tra - jtenberg , 2001 ) . To ensure that I could assign each patent to an organization , I considered only pub - lic ﬁrms , for which I could identify subsidiaries relatively easily over time . I used the concor - dance ﬁle provided by Bessen ( 2009 ) to con - nect the assignee identiﬁcation number of the NBER patent data set to the Compustat GVKEY identiﬁcation number . These connections revealed the ﬁrms and subsidiaries identiﬁed in the ‘Who Owns Whom ? ’ database . Ownership may change through mergers , acquisitions , or spin - offs , and when an organization is acquired / merged / spun - off , its patents likely go to the new owner . These changes have been tracked using data on the merg - ers and acquisitions of public companies reported in the SDC database . In total , I gathered 337 , 054 U . S . patents whose ﬁrst inventor resides in the United States , were applied for from 1990 to 2000 , and were eventually granted to public companies , which represented the sample used in the empirical analysis . The selection of the 1990 to 2000 time period mainly reﬂected practical reasons . First , the enforcement index elaborated for U . S . states by Garmaise ( 2011 ) , which I used in my empirical analysis , similarly refers to this time Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . Strat . Mgmt . J . , 35 : 1230 – 1248 ( 2014 ) DOI : 10 . 1002 / smj Non - Competition Agreements and Firm R & D Riskiness 1235 period . 1 Second , choosing a relatively short window of time enabled me to estimate the effects of a change in non - compete regulations while keeping other possible state - level changes constant . Third , I ended the data collection in 2000 to ensure sufﬁcient additional time to measure the patented inventions’ value , according to the number of forward citations received . This time period limitation also produces some shortcom - ings , especially because it excludes two important longitudinal changes in non - compete enforcement ( in Michigan in 1985 and in Louisiana in 2004 ) from the analysis . However , the alternative of a longer time window was even worse , for three reasons . First , the 1985 non - compete enforcement change in Michigan was simultaneous to the intro - duction of an antitakeover law ( cf . Atanassov , 2013 ) and preceded a branch banking deregulation by just one year ( cf . Kerr and Nanda , 2009 ) . This would lead to a spurious estimate of the impact of non - compete enforcement . Second , using data before 1985 would prevent me from assigning patents to their correct organization because the SDC database I used to identify the ownership structure of public companies over time is reliable only after 1986 . 2 Finally , the last version of the NBER patent database includes information about all patents granted up to December 2006 . Thus , it would be impossible to obtain a reliable measure of the number of forward citations received by patents applied for after 2004 . Empirical strategy The empirical analysis pertains to the invention level . I estimated the impact of the strength of non - compete enforcement in a certain state on the likelihood that an invention produced by an inventor residing in that state would be a breakthrough ( H1 ) or a failure ( H2 ) or would refer to a new technological area ( H3 ) . Breakthroughs are extremely valuable inven - tions , so I measured inventive breakthroughs according to the number of forward citations 1 To be precise , the index elaborated by Garmaise ( 2011 ) refers to 1992 to 2004 . However , no changes in non - compete enforcement occurred in 1990 to 1991 . According to Samila and Sorenson ( 2011 : 427 ) , ‘only four states have experienced meaningful changes over the last 30years’ and none of them took place in 1990 or 1991 . 2 The SDC database covers acquisition of non - U . S . targets only from 1985 to present . received by a patent since the year of its appli - cation . The number of citations correlates with several measures of technological and economic value , including consumer surplus generated ( Trajtenberg , 1990 ) , expert evaluations of patent value ( Albert et al . , 1991 ) , patent renewal rates ( Harhoff et al . , 1999 ) , contribution to an organiza - tion’s market value ( Hall , Jaffe , and Trajtenberg , 2005 ) , and inventors’ assessments of economic value ( Gambardella et al . , 2008 ) . Similar to previous studies ( Fleming and Singh 2010 ; Phene et al . , 2005 ) , I employed a dichotomous variable that takes a value of ‘1’ if the patent is in the top 5 percent in terms of forward citations received , with respect to all patents applied for in the same year ( by application date ) and in the same technological class ( i . e . , four - digit International Patent Classiﬁcation ( IPC ) classes ) . The variable equals ‘0’ otherwise . In line with Fleming and Singh ( 2010 ) , I measured a failure according to whether the invention received no forward citations . Therefore , I used a dummy variable that takes the value of ‘1’ if a patent received no citations and ‘0’ otherwise . Finally , I coded a ﬁrm’s invention in new tech - nological areas as equal to ‘1’ if the patented invention referred to a primary patent class dif - ferent from the primary classes of patents applied for by that organization in the previous ﬁve years ; and ‘0’ otherwise ( Gilsing et al . , 2008 ) . The patent class referred to the ﬁrst four digits of the IPC sys - tem . Consistent with prior research ( Argote , Beck - man , and Epple , 1990 ) , I considered a ﬁve - year window to account for the rate of organizational forgetting . To identify the impact of non - compete agree - ments , I took advantage of an index that mea - sures the enforcement of non - compete covenants in U . S . states , as elaborated by Garmaise ( 2011 ) and based on 12 questions proposed by Mals - berger ( 2004 ) . 3 Speciﬁcally , I exploited the fact that two states ( Texas and Florida ) exhibited two opposite and almost simultaneous shifts in this index . In June 1994 , in Light v . Centel Cellular Co . , the Texas Supreme Court issued a new set of requirements for enforcement of non - compete agreements . Therefore , whereas the 3 This index assigns one point for each dimension for which the jurisdiction’s enforcement exceeds a given threshold , so total scores range from 0 to 12 . A complete list of questions , thresholds , and state totals appear in Appendix 2 . Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . Strat . Mgmt . J . , 35 : 1230 – 1248 ( 2014 ) DOI : 10 . 1002 / smj 1236 R . Conti non - competition enforcement index score for Texas equaled 5 before 1994 , it fell to 3 after the decision . The Florida law change instead resulted from actions by the state legislature which , in May 1996 , replaced the state’s existing law regulat - ing non - competes . As a result of this change , its enforcement index increased from seven to nine . To the extent that changes in non - compete regula - tions are neither inﬂuenced nor predicted by indi - viduals , such treatments can be considered truly exogenous . For Texas , this consideration appears well supported because the change in non - compete enforcement was generated by a Texas Supreme Court decision . It is reasonable to assume that companies were not aware of the impending deci - sion by the Court . However , the change in Florida resulted from the actions of the state legislature , so companies were probably aware of the widely debated possible change ( Marx et al . , 2009 ) . Even in this case though , endogeneity does not seem to be an issue . If managers expected the change in regulation , the R & D organization could have started changing its practices prior to the approval of the new law , and the coefﬁcient would under - estimate the impact of the change in enforcement . Therefore , my test would be even more conserva - tive . Using a difference - in - differences technique , I estimated the effect of the treatment ( i . e . , the exogenous change in non - compete enforcement in Texas and Florida ) on the outcome variables by comparing what happened to the treatment group before and after the treatment against what hap - pened to a group that was not subject to the treatment ( control group ) , again before and after the treatment . The inventions generated in Texas and Florida represent the treated groups , whereas inventions in other U . S . states constitute the con - trol group . A crucial assumption underlying the difference - in - differences technique is that differ - ences in the outcome variables between treated and control groups would have remained constant without the treatment . Both visual inspection of the trends and a t - test of their differences before the Texas and Florida treatments indicate that this assumption is viable . To estimate the effect of decreased non - compete enforcement in Texas in 1994 on the probability that an invention i generated by ﬁrm j , in state s at time t , is a breakthrough ( H1 ) , a failure ( H2 ) , or in a new technological area ( H3 ) , I excluded the Florida observations and estimated the following logit models : Prob (cid:2) Breakthrough ijst = 1 | X (cid:3) = Prob ( α ( TX ∗ Post1994 ) + β TX + γ Post1994 + δ Z + e ijst > 0 (cid:3) ( 1 ) Prob (cid:2) Failure ijst = 1 | X (cid:3) = Prob ( α ( TX ∗ Post1994 ) + β TX + γ Post1994 + δ Z + e ijst > 0 (cid:3) ( 2 ) Prob (cid:2) NewArea ijst = 1 | X (cid:3) = Prob ( α ( TX ∗ Post1994 ) + β TX + γ Post1994 + δ Z + e ijst > 0 (cid:3) ( 3 ) In these equations , ( TX * Post1994 ) is the treat - ment ; TX is the dummy variable that takes a value of ‘1’ for inventions in Texas and ‘0’ otherwise , and Post1994 is a dummy that takes the value of ‘1’ for inventions applied for in the period after 1994 and ‘0’ otherwise . Furthermore , Z is the vec - tor of controls , including state ﬁxed effects . In Texas , the treatment reduces non - compete enforce - ment , so I expect α to be negative in Equations 1 , 2 , and 3 , consistent with H1 - H3 . 4 For Florida , which experienced increasing enforcement in 1996 , I excluded observations referring to Texas and estimated the following regressions : Prob (cid:2) Breakthrough ijst = 1 | X (cid:3) = Prob ( α ( FL ∗ Post1996 ) + β FL + γ Post1996 + δ Z + e ijst > 0 (cid:3) ( 4 ) Prob (cid:2) Failure ijst = 1 | X (cid:3) = Prob ( α ( FL ∗ Post1996 ) + β FL + γ Post1996 + δ Z + e ijst > 0 (cid:3) ( 5 ) Prob (cid:2) NewArea ijst = 1 | X (cid:3) = Prob ( α ( FL ∗ Post1996 ) + β FL + γ Post1996 + δ Z + e ijst > 0 (cid:3) ( 6 ) 4 Despite some concerns about the interpretation of interaction terms in nonlinear models ( Ai and Norton , 2003 ) , Puhani ( 2008 ) demonstrates that they are not relevant for treatment effects in nonlinear difference - in - differences models .

J . , 35 : 1230 – 1248 ( 2014 ) DOI : 10 . 1002 / smj Non - Competition Agreements and Firm R & D Riskiness 1237 In these equations , FL is a dummy that takes the value of ‘1’ for inventions in Florida and ‘0’ otherwise , and Post1996 is a dummy that takes a value of ‘1’ for inventions applied for in the period after 1996 and ‘0’ otherwise . For Florida , the treatment entails an increase in non - compete enforcement , so I expect α to be positive in Equations 4 , 5 , and 6 . A potential pitfall of the difference - in - differences estimation is the inconsistency in standard errors that can result from serial cor - relations among observations and that may be extremely high if the analysis includes several periods of time . This issue may lead to spurious statistical signiﬁcance in the treatment . Therefore , I adopted the strategy suggested by Bertrand , Duﬂo , and Mullainathan ( 2004 ) and clustered the errors to the state level . In Equations 1 to 6 , the vector Z of controls also includes ﬁrm - level variables . Speciﬁcally , I took into account the number of employees and the size of the ﬁrm’s knowledge base , 5 measured as the number of patents granted to the ﬁrm and applied for in the ﬁve - year window previous to the year of observation . Both variables aimed to capture the impact of the ﬁrm’s scale , which is clearly impor - tant for R & D activity , though ﬁndings about the exact sign of this effect remain controversial ( see Ahuja , Lampert , and Tandon , 2008 ) . To address the diversity of ﬁrm technological knowledge , which may prevent routine thinking and increase the chances of a breakthrough ( Ahuja and Lampert , 2001 ) , I controlled for the specialization of the ﬁrm’s knowledge base , according to the indicator specializatio n it = (cid:4) k (cid:5) n kt n t (cid:6) 2 , where n t is the total number of patents applied for by the ﬁrm in the ﬁve years preceding year t , and n kt is the num - ber of patents in the ( four - digit ) IPC technological class k , applied for in the same period of time . The indicator measured the concentration of a ﬁrm’s knowledge stock within some technology classes in the ﬁve years before year t . Table 1 summa - rizes the operationalization of the variables for the analysis . 5 I did not include ﬁrms’ R & D expenditures for two reasons . First , its correlation with the size of ﬁrm knowledge base is greater than 0 . 8 . Second , Garmaise ( 2011 ) shows that non - competes do not inﬂuence R & D expenditures . Excluding this variable from the empirical analysis should not create a bias in the estimated impact of non - compete enforcement . RESULTS Descriptive statistics Tables 2 and 3 contain the descriptive statistics and pairwise correlations among variables . The correlation between non - compete enforcement and the probability that an invention is a breakthrough is negative ; however , this result may reﬂect other variables at the state level that correlate negatively with the degree of non - compete enforcement but positively with inventive performance . As a con - crete example , California forbids non - competes , but its culture , which promotes knowledge exchanges and risk taking , allows many California companies to produce pathbreaking inventions ( Saxenian , 1994 ) . Ignoring other state - level vari - ables would mistakenly attribute to non - competes a negative impact on the probability of achieving technological breakthroughs . There is a strong correlation between the size of ﬁrms’ knowledge stocks ( log of the number of patents ) , ﬁrm technological diversiﬁcation , and the number of employees . However , potential multicollinearity problems are lessened by the large number of observations in the sample . The results of the difference - in - differences approaches , in Tables 4 and 5 , refer to each state . In Table 4 , the results for Texas are con - sistent with H1 and H2 , such that the decrease in non - compete enforcement led to a lower likelihood of any invention being pathbreaking or a failure . Moreover , in line with H3 , when non - compete agreements were enforced less strictly , the probability of any invention occurring in a novel technological area declined . In addi - tion , the results in Table 5 conﬁrm the predicted outcomes for Florida . Speciﬁcally , the greater non - compete enforcement after 1996 augmented the likelihood of any invention being pathbreaking ( H1 ) , a failure ( H2 ) , and in a new technological domain ( H3 ) . I analyzed the time path of the response to variation in non - compete enforcement . As the results in Tables 6 and 7 show , the magnitude of coefﬁcients representing the impact of a change in non - compete enforcement tended to decrease over time . For Texas , for instance , the greatest impact took place in 1996 , two years after the change in the non - compete regulation ( Table 6 ) . Similarly , for Florida , the greatest impact in most cases ( cf . impact on the probability of failures ) arose one Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . Strat . Mgmt .

These results suggest that any variation in the enforcement of non - competes mainly affected ﬁrms’ R & D riskiness in the short run . In the long run , organizational changes aimed at protecting the ﬁrm’s knowledge base likely would compensate for these effects . The analyses exploit - ing cross - state , rather than longitudinal , differences in non - compete enforcement also indicated no signiﬁcant impact of non - compete enforcement on the variables of interest ( available on request ) . This ﬁnding might be due to the expiration of the non - compete effect over time , in that cross - state differences likely reﬂect a long - term equilibrium . However , I cannot ignore an alternative explana - tion : that non - competes do not actually exert any effect on the riskiness of R & D strategy , and the results in Tables 4 and 5 are produced by some idiosyncratic events occurring in Texas and Florida in the same years of the non - compete enforcement changes . Yet , an analysis of the legislation archives for Texas and Florida and of previous literature about changes in U . S . laws potentially affecting innovation , suggest that no other simultaneous shocks may , in fact , drive the ﬁndings . 6 Robustness checks The previous difference - in differences analysis may raise some concerns . First , despite the statis - tical signiﬁcance of the coefﬁcients , results might be due to chance . In order to discard this possi - bility , I adopted a completely diverse difference - in - differences design . Speciﬁcally , I compared the inventions produced in Texas ( Florida ) by one group of ﬁrms affected by non - competes against the inventions produced in Texas ( Florida ) by 6 Speciﬁcally , all changes in banking deregulation laws ( Kerr and Nanda , 2009 ) , antitakeover laws ( Atanassov , 2013 ) , labor market laws ( Autor , 2003 ) , and trade secrecy laws ( Png , 2012 ) occurred in most U . S . states ( including Texas and Florida ) well before the time period ( 1990 to 2000 ) considered in this work . Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . Strat . Mgmt .

Therefore , the treated group is represented by inventions pro - duced in Texas ( Florida ) by ﬁrms with at least one competitor ( i . e . , another ﬁrm in the same four - digit standard industrial classiﬁcation ( SIC ) code ) that had invented in the same state before the non - compete change . The large majority of inventors move within the state boundaries ( Marx , Singh , and Fleming , 2010 ) , so an increase in non - compete enforcement would help these ﬁrms prevent their employees from migrating to competitors . The control group consists of inventions produced in Texas ( Florida ) by ﬁrms without any rivals in the same state . These companies are only marginally affected by a change in non - compete enforce - ment , because the possibility of their employ - ees being hired by a competitor is already very low . The results in Tables 8 and 9 reafﬁrm my previous ﬁndings and the underlying theory . Speciﬁcally , the 1994 Texas decrease in non - compete enforcement decreased the probability of any invention being a breakthrough , a failure , and in new technological areas for ﬁrms with competitors in the same state ( Table 8 ) . By contrast , the 1996 Florida increase in non - compete enforcement signiﬁcantly increased the probability of any invention being a breakthrough , a failure , and in new technological areas for ﬁrms with competitors within the state ( Table 9 ) . It is worth stressing that since this was a completely different experimental design , it was extremely unlikely to again obtain results consistent with theory , both for Texas and Florida , simply due to chance . An additional concern is that , due to the large sample size , even substantively small effects might show as statistically signiﬁcant . To address this concern , I aggregated the data at the state and year levels , and I replicated the difference - in - differences models presented in Tables 4 and 5 .

To deal with a regression in which the dependent variable is bound between 0 and 1 , they propose a quasi - maximum likelihood estimator based on the logistic distribution . This approach has several advantages over alternative solutions . First , a linear functional form of the conditional mean might miss important nonlinearities . Second , a log - odds transformation fails when the variable falls at the corners . The analyses I perform with these variations at the state levels ( Tables 10 and 11 ) fully conﬁrm my previous ﬁndings . In Texas , where enforcement decreased , the propor - tion of breakthroughs , failures , and inventions in new technological domains also decreased ( Table 10 ) . In Florida , where the enforcement increased , so did these proportions ( Table 11 ) . Furthermore , the results might not be robust to different deﬁnitions of the dependent variables .

Therefore , I replicated the empirical analyses using a measure of breakthrough that indicated whether the patent was in the top 1 percent ( rather than 5 percent ) of the value distribution of patents applied for in the same year and in the same four - digit IPC class . The results were similar ( Tables 10 and 11 , Column 4 ) .

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS Previous research has extensively studied the implications of non - compete agreements for regional growth and performance , but far less is known about the impact of these contracts on ﬁrms’ strategies . This study investigates the impact of non - competition agreements on the type of R & D activity undertaken by companies . In areas where non - compete agreements are enforced more strictly , the likelihood that corporate inventions are explorative and pathbreaking increases .

Accordingly , this work offers several key contributions to prior literature . First , I provide relevant insights into how the strategies and competitive advantages of ﬁrms depend on the institutional environments in which they are embedded ( see also Furman , 2003 ; Ingram and Silverman , 2002 ; Pe’er and Gottschalg , 2011 ) . With regard to innovative performance , Hall and Soskice ( 2001 ) suggest that in liberal market economies ( e . g . , U . S . , U . K . ) , labor turnover pushes companies to innovate more radically than ﬁrms in coordinated market countries ( e . g . , Germany , France ) , where ﬁrms instead specialize in incremental , less risky innovation . However , this study provides evidence that in regions that enforce non - competes strictly , which limits mobility , corporate inventions actually tend to be radical and pathbreaking . Second , I clarify how the effect of knowledge leakages on ﬁrm proﬁtability varies with ﬁrm characteristics . Shaver and Flyer ( 2000 ) have argued that unintended knowledge spillovers to competitors are asymmetric with respect to the quality of the ﬁrm’s technologies . This work extends their contribution by showing that mobility - induced knowledge leakages are asymmetric with respect to the riskiness of the ﬁrm’s R & D , such that proﬁt decreases relatively more when ﬁrms pursue riskier research projects . Third , this study offers interesting ﬁndings for entrepreneurship literature , which previously has assumed non - competition agreements are barriers to the formation of new companies that decrease technological variety and risk taking . But my study shows that the strong appropriability regime cre - ated by non - competes actually can stimulate cor - porate entrepreneurship and encourage managers to experiment with and explore risky , potentially pathbreaking technological solutions . Thus non - competes , by increasing the degree of technolog - ical exploration and risk taking within companies , might indirectly increase the degree of exploration and risk taking across the regions that host these companies . This last result is consistent with some recent research that shows that non - competition agreements , by providing entrepreneurs with IPR for their ideas , can foster regional innovation and growth ( Franco and Mitchell , 2008 ) . Fourth , I offer insights for the growing stream of research that examines the tails of inventions’ value distributions , rather than the average value of inventions ( e . g . , Ahuja and Lampert 2001 ; Fleming and Singh 2010 ) . The interest in tails is motivated mainly by the skewed distribution of inventions’ value ; a few inventions account for a dispropor - tionate share of value ( Gambardella et al . , 2008 ) . Non - competes enhance the likelihood that any sin - gle invention appears in the tails of the inventions’ value distribution , whether as a breakthrough or a failure . In this sense , this study contributes to investigations of the impact of legal appropriability regimes on inventive performance ( e . g . , Ginarte and Park , 1997 ; Kanwar and Evenson , 2003 ; Qian , 2007 ; Sakakibara and Branstetter , 2001 ) . Further studies should consider how IPR laws might affect not only the average inventive perfor - mance , but also the tails of the inventive outcome distribution .

First , the underlying theory assumes that the decision about whether to undertake a safe or a risky project is made centrally by the ﬁrm , rather than autonomously by researchers . Anecdotal evi - dence suggests that , in general , this assumption holds . Even at Google—famous for providing cor - porate researchers with autonomy to work on their own projects—employees must work on projects chosen centrally during at least 80 percent of their work time . However , if researchers , rather than the company , choose the type of projects , an alterna - tive explanation might emerge . To the extent that workers move from one state to another , they may choose states that support their job attitudes or pro - vide a preferred degree of non - compete enforce - ment . Career - oriented researchers , who enjoy moving throughout their career and like to pur - sue incremental projects , might select and move to states where non - compete enforcement is rela - tively low . This sorting argument appears theoret - ically appealing , but it cannot explicate the results of this study for at least two main reasons : ( 1 ) the proportion of U . S . inventors who have relocated to states following a change in non - compete enforce - ment is quite low ( Marx et al . , 2010 ) ; and ( 2 ) in unreported analyses , I determined that a change in non - compete enforcement had no signiﬁcant impact on inventors’ skills ( as measured by educa - tional attainment ) or salary ( available on request ) . Second , this study relies on the assumption that companies actually use non - competes . If they did not , any increase in enforcement would have little inﬂuence on companies’ R & D choices . However , evidence provided by Kaplan and Stromberg ( 2003 ) and Holley ( 1998 ) strongly indicates that companies use non - competes whenever possible . Third , restricting the sample to public compa - nies implies a need to conduct additional stud - ies with private companies , which likely differ in several dimensions . The ownership structure of a ﬁrm may directly inﬂuence its corporate risk taking ( e . g . , Jensen and Meckling , 1976 ; May , 1995 ) . In turn , the same degree of non - compete enforcement could have differential impacts for public versus private corporate decisions to pursue risky but high potential R & D projects . Moreover , focusing on just public companies prevents us from assessing the overall impact of non - competes . Therefore , this study cannot offer any clear - cut social welfare implications regarding changes to non - compete enforcement . Fourth and ﬁnally , I measured inventive perfor - mance using forward citations to patents , which creates a biased measure of failure . That is , I can observe only patented inventions that receive no forward citations ; I cannot observe real fail - ures , such as R & D projects that never lead to any patents . In addition , forward citations have another shortcoming : non - competes reduce inven - tors’ mobility , which means they could also have a direct negative impact on the amount of for - ward citations , which are proxies for knowledge spillovers . However , in this case , a stricter non - compete enforcement would decrease the likeli - hood of extremely valuable inventions , which is the opposite of what results show . Despite these limitations , this study provides important insights for managers and policy makers . Practitioners have shown growing interest in the relationship between business activity and institutional environment , and government policies have strong inﬂuence on companies’ economic value ( McKinsey Global Survey , 2010 ) . Among the different activities that governments perform , passing laws and enforcing regulations likely have the greatest effect on business man - agement . This study helps clarify the relationship between non - compete regulation and strategic R & D management . In particular , the argument and ﬁndings support the idea that mobility - induced knowledge leakages are asymmetric with respect to the degree of risk in R & D strategies . Therefore , R & D managers should choose their risk levels according to the extent to which they can use non - competes and appropriate returns from R & D . They should undertake risky trajectories only if they can prevent employees from leaving and taking their knowledge with them . Another implication relates to the management of R & D in multilocation corporations . To the extent that a company can choose to allocate projects to different locations , it should strate - gically move the riskiest R & D projects to areas where non - compete enforcement is strict or , more generally , where IPR protections are strong . Whereas this study considers the degree of R & D riskiness as something ﬁrms can choose , some risk is inherent in R & D and , thus , beyond managerial control . In the long run , even laws may be the object of organizational strategies , though ( Ingram and Silverman , 2002 ) . Companies operating in highly uncertain technological sectors ( i . e . , where R & D is very risky ) have more to Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . Strat . Mgmt . J . , 35 : 1230 – 1248 ( 2014 ) DOI : 10 . 1002 / smj Non - Competition Agreements and Firm R & D Riskiness 1245 gain from stronger appropriability regimes , so they should proactively interact with the gov - ernment to encourage increased enforcement of non - competes . Finally , by offering information that can support decisions by policy makers , this study should indi - rectly improve the interactions between business and government . Managers complain that regula - tors do not fully understand the economic impact of government policies ( McKinsey Global Survey , 2010 ) . For example , my ﬁndings indicate that non - compete agreements create , at the regional level , a trade - off between entrepreneurship and intrapreneurship . They likely limit the formation of new companies , which might create technological variety in a region . However , non - competes also increase the degree of technological exploration by existing companies and enhance the likelihood that corporate inventions will be pathbreaking . The extent to which policy makers should favor exploration by entrepreneurship , rather than explo - ration by intrapreneurship , remains an interesting question for further research .

APPENDIX 1 The proﬁts π A and π B of two R & D projects , A and B , are two random variables , π A ∼ F A ( x ) and π B ∼ F B ( x ) , where F A and F B are two continuous cdf with support ( − L , P ) , where L is the maximum loss a ﬁrm can sustain for a project and P is the highest payoff a ﬁrm can achieve . Project B is riskier than Project A , according to the classical deﬁnition by Rothschild and Stiglitz ( 1970 ) , because B is a mean - preserving spread of A : π B = π A + z , where z ∼ F ( z ) is a random vari - able with the same support of π A and with E ( z | π A ) = 0 for all π A . By deﬁnition , E ( π B ) = E ( π A ) . Once a project turns out to be proﬁtable , the employee working on it leaves with probability λ and , in that case , the ﬁrm’s proﬁts drop of a share γ . The ﬁrm’s expected proﬁts from Project A are E ( π A ) = (cid:7) 0 − L x A dF A ( x ) + ( 1 − λγ ) (cid:7) P 0 x A dF A ( x ) , whereas the expected proﬁts from Project B are E ( π B ) = E ( π A + z ) = E ( π A ) + (cid:7) 0 − L ZdF z + ( 1 − λγ ) (cid:7) P 0 ZdF z . If λ and γ are both greater than 0 , then (cid:7) 0 − L ZdF z + ( 1 − λγ ) (cid:7) P 0 ZdF z < 0 and E ( π B ) < E ( π A ) . APPENDIX 2 QUESTIONS AND THRESHOLDS TO ASSESS NON - COMPETE ENFORCEMENT The list of questions and thresholds is provided by Garmaise ( 2011 ) . Each state is granted one point for each question when its laws lie above the threshold . Question 1 . Is there a state statute of gen - eral application that governs the enforcement of covenants not to compete ? Threshold 1 . States with statutes that enforce non - competition agreements outside a sale - of - business context receive a score of 1 . Question 2 . What is an employer’s protectable interest and how is it deﬁned ? Threshold 2 . States in which the employer can prevent the employee from future independent dealings with all the ﬁrm’s customers , not merely with the customers with whom the employee had direct contact , receive a score of 1 . Question 3 . What must the plaintiff be able to show to prove the existence of an enforceable covenant not to compete ? Threshold 3 . Laws that place greater weight on the interests of the ﬁrm relative to those of the former employee are above the threshold . For example , a law that requires that the contract be reasonably protective of the ﬁrm’s business interests and only meet the condition of not being unreasonably injurious to the employee’s interests would receive a score of 1 . Question 4 . Does the signing of a covenant not to compete at the inception of the employment relationship provide sufﬁcient consideration to support the covenant ? Threshold 4 . States for which the answer to Question 4 is clearly ‘yes’ are above the threshold . Question 5 . Will a change in the terms and conditions of employment provide sufﬁcient con - sideration to support a covenant not to compete entered into after the employment relationship has begun ? Threshold 5 . States for which the answer to Question 5 is clearly ‘yes’ are above the threshold . Question 6 . Will continued employment provide sufﬁcient consideration to support a covenant not to compete entered into after the employment relationship has begun ? Threshold 6 . States for which the answer to Question 6 is clearly ‘yes’ are above the threshold . Question 7 . What factors will the court con - sider in determining whether time and geographic restrictions in the covenant are reasonable ? Threshold 7 . Jurisdictions in which courts are instructed not to consider economic or other Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . Strat . Mgmt . J . , 35 : 1230 – 1248 ( 2014 ) DOI : 10 . 1002 / smj 1248 R . Conti hardships faced by the employee are above the threshold . Question 8 . Who has the burden of proving the reasonableness or unreasonableness of the covenant not to compete ? Threshold 8 . States in which the burden of proof is clearly placed on the employee are above the threshold . Question 9 . What type of time or geographic restrictions has the court found to be reasonable ? Unreasonable ? Threshold 9 . Jurisdictions in which three - year statewide restrictions have been upheld receive a score of 1 . Question 10 . If the restrictions in the covenant not to compete are unenforceable because they are overbroad , are the courts permitted to modify the covenant to make the restrictions more narrow and to make the covenants enforceable ? Threshold 10 . States for which the answer to Question 10 is clearly ‘yes’ are above the threshold . Question 11 . If the employer terminates the employment relationship , is the covenant enforce - able ? Threshold 11 . States for which the answer to Question 11 is clearly ‘yes’ are above the threshold . Question 12 . What damages may an employer recover and from whom for breach of a covenant not to compete ? Threshold 12 . If , in addition to lost proﬁts , there is a potential for punitive damages against the former employee , the state receives a score of one . States that explicitly exclude considera - tion of the reasonableness of the contract from the calculation of damages are also above the threshold .
