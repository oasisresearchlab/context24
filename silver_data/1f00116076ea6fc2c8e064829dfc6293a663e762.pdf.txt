Together , they mediate a signal transduction pathway initiated by ligand binding to cell surface receptors . Interaction with Rab5 is conﬁned to the amino ( N ) - terminal region of APPL1 . We report the crystal structures of human APPL1 N - terminal BAR - PH domain motif . The BAR and PH do - mains , together with a novel linker helix , form an inte - grated , crescent - shaped , symmetrical dimer . This BAR – PH interaction is likely conserved in the class of BAR - PH containing proteins . Biochemical analyses indicate two independent Rab - binding sites located at the opposite ends of the dimer , where the PH domain directly interacts with Rab5 and Rab21 . Besides structurally supporting the PH domain , the BAR domain also contributes to Rab binding through a small surface region in the vicinity of the PH domain . In stark contrast to the helix - dominated , Rab - binding domains previously reported , APPL1 PH do - main employs b - strands to interact with Rab5 . On the Rab5 side , both switch regions are involved in the interaction . Thus we identiﬁed a new binding mode between PH domains and small GTPases .

The small GTPase Rab5 is a generally acknowledged prominent regulator of vesicle trafﬁcking en - route from the plasma membrane to early endosomes ( Li , 1996 ) , whereas APPL1 ( also called DIP13 a ) is identiﬁed with signaling pathways of adiponectin , insulin , EGF , follicle stimulating hormone receptor , neurotrophin receptor ( TrkA ) , oxidative stress , and DCC - mediated apoptosis ( Liu et al , 2002 ; Miaczynska et al , 2004 ; Lin et al , 2006 ; Mao et al , 2006 ; Varsano et al , 2006 ; Nechamen et al , 2007 ) . Within this milieu , APPL1 speciﬁcally binds to the GTP - bound , active form of Rab5 . In response to extracellular stimuli , Rab5 hydrolyzes its bound GTP , releasing APPL1 from an endocytic structure , and allowing APPL1 to further interact with com - ponents of nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylase complexes . The interaction with Rab5 is essential for APPL1 localization to the endosomes and is indispensable for the functional cycle of APPL1 ( Miaczynska et al , 2004 ) . Human APPL1 , a multidomain protein 709 amino - acid ( aa ) residues in length contains an amino ( N ) - terminal BAR ( B in1 / A mphiphysin / R VS167 ) domain and a PH ( p leckstrin h omology ) domain followed by a carboxy ( C ) - terminal PTB ( p hospho t yrosine b inding ) domain ( Sakamuro et al , 1996 ; Liu et al , 2002 ; Miaczynska et al , 2004 ) . The Rab5 - binding site is located in the N - terminal BAR - PH region ( Miaczynska et al , 2004 ) , while the C - terminal region is found to interact with a host of other proteins , including the adiponectin receptor ( Mao et al , 2006 ) , Akt2 / PKB b kinase ( Mitsuuchi et al , 1999 ) , tumor suppressor DCC ( Liu et al , 2002 ) , TrkA , and TrkA interacting protein GIPC1 ( Lin et al , 2006 ) . Based on aa sequence analysis , BAR domains have been identiﬁed in many proteins involved in intracellular trafﬁck - ing , but sequence homology is low in general among known BAR domains ( Farsad et al , 2001 ; Habermann , 2004 ) . The BAR domain typically contains three long kinked a - helices ( a 1 , a 2 , and a 3 ) that form a well - packed , crescent - shaped , symmetrical , six - helix bundle , side - by - side antiparallel homodimer ; a structure proposed to exert its function as a convex membrane - curvature sensor or stabilizer . The con - cave surface of the BAR dimer is proposed to bind preferen - tially to a negatively charged , curved membrane largely through electrostatic interactions . Furthermore , some BAR domains have been found to bind to small GTPases , a class of intracellular molecular switches ( Tarricone et al , 2001 ; Habermann , 2004 ) ; thus , their membrane association is directly linked to regulation of signal transduction and traf - ﬁcking .

The BAR domain of APPL1 is required for Rab5 binding and membrane recruitment ( Miaczynska et al , 2004 ) , although the mechanisms remain to be elucidated . The PH domain is approximately 100 - residue long , and has been identiﬁed in over 100 different eukaryotic proteins such as kinases , isoforms of phospholipase C ( PLC ) , GTPases , and their regulators ; most of which participate in cell signaling and cytoskeletal regulation ( Rebecchi and Scarlata , 1998 ) . Despite their minimal sequence homology , the three - dimen - sional ( 3D ) structures of PH domains are remarkably con - served . They possess a common core consisting of seven b - strands and a C - terminal a - helix ( Rebecchi and Scarlata , 1998 ) . Some PH domains speciﬁcally bind to phosphatidyl - inositol phosphates , suggesting that one possible function of this family is to anchor the host proteins to membranes . PH domains are also suggested to bind to the G bg complex of the heterotrimeric G protein , protein kinase C , and small GTPases . Nevertheless , none of these functions is absolutely conserved . For instance , the PH domain of APPL1 alone is insufﬁcient for binding to the membrane ( Miaczynska et al , 2004 ) . The PH domain immediately follows the C - terminus of the BAR domain ; such a BAR - PH motif is essential for Rab5 binding . The same motif has also been found in a homolog Rab5 effector APPL2 , centaurin - b family members , GRAF2 , and oligophrenin ( Habermann , 2004 ) , but the 3D structure organization of BAR - PH motif and its functional implication remained elusive until now . In order to address the functional roles of the BAR - PH motif in APPL1 and related proteins , we have carried out structure - function studies on human APPL1 and determined the crystal structures of the Rab5 - binding region of APPL1 as well as the BAR domain alone . The results show that two BAR - PH molecules form an integrated , symmetric homodi - mer , and the PH domain has extensive intermolecular inter - actions with the BAR domain . The BAR dimer of APPL1 has a stronger curvature than other reported BAR structures . Further mutagenesis analyses allowed us to identify the binding sites on both APPL1 and Rab5 . In sharp contrast to the presumed conﬂict between concurrent membrane asso - ciation and GTPase binding by the BAR dimer ( Habermann , 2004 ) , the novel binding mode of the BAR - PH dimer should permit simultaneous interactions with both . Results Protein expression and crystallography Recombinant proteins of human APPL1 N - terminal fragments including the BAR ( residues 5 (cid:1) 265 ) and BAR - PH domains ( residues 5 (cid:1) 385 ) were expressed in Escherichia coli , then puriﬁed using His tag afﬁnity chromatography . The samples were crystallized after removing the tag with thrombin , which generated a four - residue ( Gly – Ser – His – Met ) peptide N - terminal to the native Asp5 residue . The BAR domain crystal diffracted up to 1 . 8 - A˚ resolution on a beamline at the Argonne Advanced Photon Source ( APS ) synchrotron facility . The crystal belongs to P2 1 2 1 2 space group . Phases of the structural factors were determined using the Se - Met - based single - wavelength anomalous dispersion ( SAD ) method ( Supplementary data ) . There is one APPL1 BAR molecule per asymmetric unit , with B 41 % solvent content . Regions of the N - terminus ( up to Thr12 ) , Leu75 (cid:1) Asp79 , and C - terminus ( i . e . , Pro260 (cid:1) Asp265 ) were missing from the ﬁnal reﬁned model because of lack of interpretable electron density . The BAR - PH crystal diffracted to 2 . 05 - A˚ resolution at the synchrotron facility . The crystal also belongs to P2 1 2 1 2 space group . There is one APPL1 BAR - PH molecule per asymmetric unit , with B 45 % solvent content . Phases of this crystal form were calculated using a combination of molecular replace - ment and SAD methods , and further improved with density modiﬁcation . Regions of N - terminal non - native tripeptide ( i . e . , Gly – Ser – His ) , Gly76 (cid:1) Asp78 , Asn288 (cid:1) Ser295 , and C - terminus ( i . e . , Ser380 (cid:1) Glu385 ) lacked interpretable electron density and were omitted from the ﬁnal reﬁned model . Data collection and reﬁnement statistics are summarized in Table I . BAR domain structure and dimerization From the two crystal forms of APPL1 peptides , we obtained two crystallographically independent BAR domain models . In both cases , the APPL1 BAR domain has three long helices , namely a 1 , a 2 , and a 3 . In addition , the APPL1 BAR domain contains an extra nine - turn a - helix , a 4 ( Figure 1 ; Supplementary Figure 1 ) . The two models could be super - imposed onto each other with a moderate , 1 . 3 - A˚ , C a - atom root mean square deviation ( r . m . s . d . ) if ﬂexible terminal and loop regions ( i . e . , residues 5 (cid:1) 18 , 75 (cid:1) 79 , 151 (cid:1) 153 , and 255 (cid:1) 265 ) were omitted . Thus , the overall structure of the BAR domain remains the same either alone or in the context of BAR - PH motif .

Structure of APPL1 BAR - PH domain G Zhu et al & 2007 European Molecular Biology Organization The EMBO Journal VOL 26 | NO 14 | 2007 3485 In each of the two crystal forms , two BAR molecules form a tightly packed dimer , which assumes a crescent - like shape , a hallmark of the BAR dimer structure ( Figure 1 ) . In the BAR dimer , the helix a 1 forms an antiparallel helix bundle with its symmetry counterpart , giving shape to the concave surface of the crescent - like dimer . Helix a 4 packs against a 3 of the symmetry mate on the convex side of the dimer , and its C - terminus points to the tip of the crescent . Over 4400A˚ 2 solvent accessible surface ( SAS ) from each protomer is buried in the dimer interface . The addition of each a 4 helix to the canonical BAR motif results in approximate 1900A˚ 2 buried SAS on the two protomers , corresponding to over 40 % of the total buried SAS . Although the overall folding of APPL1 BAR domain is similar to previously reported BAR domain 3D structures ( i . e . , arfaptin2 , PDB ﬁle 1I4T ; amphiphysin , 1URU ; and en - dophilin , 1ZWW ) , those structures are in general more similar to each other than to the APPL1 BAR domain . For instance , using 150 C a atoms of the common helical regions , the r . m . s . d . values between the dimer of APPL1 BAR and 1I4T , 1URU , and 1ZWW were 3 . 7 , 3 . 8 , and 4 . 4A˚ , respectively , while those among 1I4T , 1URU , and 1ZWW range between 2 . 4 and 2 . 6A˚ . In addition , the APPL1 a 1 and a 2 helices lack extensive patches of positively charged aa residues on the concave surface ( Figure 2 ) ; such patches are thought to be essential for some BAR containing proteins to induce in vitro tubule formation ( Carlton et al , 2004 ) . The curvature of the concave face of the BAR dimer is thought to play an important role in membrane bending and / or curvature sensing ( Habermann , 2004 ) . We implemented a computing algorithm to calculate the curvature radius ( r C ) and found that the APPL1 BAR dimer has an r C about 55A˚ ( Supplementary data ; Supplementary Figure 2 ) , signiﬁcantly smaller than the r C values of other BAR dimers ( Peter et al , 2004 ) . Thus , the APPL1 BAR dimer has the strongest curva - ture among known BAR dimer structures . Structure of the APPL1 PH domain The APPL1 PH domain encompasses residues Asn276 (cid:1) Leu379 and has a typical PH folding ( Supplementary Figure 3 ) . The core structure of PH domain consists of a pair of nearly orthogonal b - sheets of four and three antiparallel b - strands ( b 1 – b 2 – b 3 – b 4 and b 5 – b 6 – b 7 ; Supplementary Figure 1 ) . The C - terminal a - helix , a C , packs against both b - sheets and contributes to the core of the domain . In the PH domain , connecting loops are named after the preceding b - strands ( e . g . , the loop between b 1 and b 2 is called L1 , etc ) . The canonical ligand - binding site is composed of b 1 , L1 , b 2 , L3 , and L6 ( exempliﬁed in the crystal structure of PLC - d 1 , PDB ﬁle 1MAI ) and , roughly speaking , is conﬁned to a triangular area with L1 , L3 , and L6 as the three vertices . Some positively charged or polar residues that have been previously identiﬁed as critical for lipid binding in this ligand - binding triangle are not conserved in APPL1 ( Supplementary Figures 1 and 3 ) , consistent with the fact that APPL1 alone lacks membrane binding ability . Packing of the BAR and PH domains In our crystal structure of the APPL1 BAR - PH dimer , the two PH domains are located at the opposite ends of the crescent - shaped dimer , and each has fairly extensive contact with the BAR domain of its symmetry mate ( Figure 1 ) . The addition of the PH domain expands the BAR dimer in the longest dimension from 140 to 170 A˚ , but hardly changes the height of the dimer ( i . e . , the dimension along the two - fold axis direction ) and its curvature . Using its b 1 , b 2 , L3 , and L7 regions , the PH domain contacts the BAR domain of its symmetry mate in two places ( Figures 1B , C and 3 ; Supplementary Figure 3 ) . First , the motif of D 15 SPxxR 20 ( where x stands for any aa residue ) at the N - terminal of BAR domain contacts b 1 , b 2 , and L3 regions of PH domain . For instance , the hydroxyl group of Tyr283 in b 1 forms a 2 . 6 - A˚ hydrogen bond with the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Asp15 ( Figure 3A ) . Second , the conserved D 334 xxDRRYCF 342 motif in the loop L7 of the PH domain is directly in contact with the loop connecting a 2 and a 3 in the BAR domain ( Figure 3B ) .

Electrostatic potentials of APPL1 BAR - PH protomer ( left ) and dimer ( middle and right ) are mapped on their molecular surfaces . Negatively charged regions ( p (cid:1) 0 . 5V ) are colored red , positively charged regions ( X þ 0 . 5V ) blue , and neutral regions gray .

( B , C ) A close view of the BAR – PH interface . These images were generated using the program PyMol . Structure of APPL1 BAR - PH domain G Zhu et al The EMBO Journal VOL 26 | NO 14 | 2007 & 2007 European Molecular Biology Organization 3486 the dimer is about 6600A˚ 2 . Thus , in the presence of PH domain , the buried SAS is 50 % larger than that of the dimer formed by BAR domain alone ( 4400 A˚ 2 ) . The canonical ‘ligand’ - binding triangle of the PH domain is oriented about 60 1 from the concave side of the BAR dimmer , so that both the PH triangle and BAR concave surface could be brought within the vicinity of a curved membrane simultaneously . Nevertheless , as discussed earlier , key residues for lipid interaction are not conserved in APPL1 . The C - terminus of PH is exposed to solvent in the dimer , consistent with the fact that it connects to the C - terminal region including the PTB domain . Because of the interaction between D 15 SPxxR 20 motif and PH domain , the rest N - terminus peptide ( residues 5 (cid:1) 12 ) clearly became ordered in the BAR - PH crystal structure , in comparison to the BAR domain - alone crystal structure , where residues N - terminal to Leu13 were invisible in the electron density map . The ﬁxed N - terminal peptide in the BAR - PH structure has an extended backbone conformation between Met4 ( remnant from the His - tag cleavage ) and Pro8 , followed by a one - turn 3 10 helix ( Figure 3C ) . This region has several important intramolecular contacts mainly with helices a 1 and a 3 . For instance , the Leu7 side chain inserts between the aromatic rings of Phe26 in a 1 and Phe182 in a 3 . Meanwhile , the side chain of Asn186 forms two hydrogen bonds with the backbone amide and carbonyl groups of Leu7 , respectively . All these hydrophobic and hydrogen bond interactions appear conserved among BAR - PH containing proteins ( Supplementary Figure 1 ) . Furthermore , the N - terminus is surrounded by a number of regions from the dimer partner , including the helix a 4 and ﬂexible loop connecting a 1 and a 2 ( where residues 76 (cid:1) 78 were mobile in the crystal structure ) . For instance , Lys6’ ( where the prime stands for the dimer partner ) forms a salt bridge with Asp243 in a 4 between the protomers . In addition , Ile9’ forms hydrophobic interactions with Met247 , Ile251 , and Leu254 in a 4 ( Figure 3C ) . To investigate roles of the BAR (cid:1) PH interaction in solution , a double point mutation , S16E / P17E , at the BAR (cid:1) PH inter - face was made . These residues are located in the region N - terminal to the BAR domain and form close contacts with b 2 and L3 of the PH domain ( Figure 3A ) . The recombinant protein of S16E / P17E double mutant in the context of BAR - PH was expressed predominantly in the insoluble fraction of cell lysate ; however , the same mutations behaved normal in the BAR - only construct ( data not shown ) . Moreover , expres - sion of the APPL1 PH domain alone in E . coli did not produce soluble recombinant protein . The data suggest that the dimer interaction between PH and BAR domains is critical for the solubility and stability of the APPL1 PH domain . Consistent with this , our analytical ultracentrifugation ( AUC ) data showed that BAR - PH protein has a higher dimerization afﬁnity in solution ( k d ¼ 0 . 34nM ) than BAR domain alone ( k d ¼ 0 . 13 m M ; Supplementary data ) . APPL1 (cid:1) Rab5 interaction in solution To study APPL1 (cid:1) Rab5 interaction in solution , we performed glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) - mediated pull - down assays . The APPL1 BAR - PH domain ( residues 5 (cid:1) 385 ) and a longer fragment with a 40 - residue extension downstream of the PH domain , APPL1 ( 5 (cid:1) 419 ) , were each effectively pulled down by GTP - bound GST (cid:1) Rab5 fusion protein ( Figure 4 ) . The APPL1 protein was pulled down by either WT Rab5 pre - loaded with non - hydrolysable GTP analog ( GppNHp ) or Rab5 - Q79L defective in GTP hydrolysis ( with or without preloaded GTP analog ) , but could not be effectively pulled down by either the WT Rab5 preloaded with GDP or Rab5 - S34N defective in GTP binding ( Figure 4 and data not shown ) . In contrast to the BAR - PH domain , we conﬁrmed Figure 3 APPL1 domain packing . ( A , B ) , Stereoviews of two major interacting regions between the PH and BAR domains .

Hydrogen bonds ( o 3 . 0A˚ ) are shown as dash - lines . Note that most residues displayed are highly conserved among the known BAR - PH containing proteins ( Supplementary Figure 1 ) . ( C ) Stereo - view of interactions of the APPL1 N - terminal region . The two protomers are colored gray and yellow , respectively . This ﬁgure was generated with the programs Molscript and Raster3D . Figure 4 Pull - down analysis of APPL1 - Rab interaction . GST fusion proteins of Rab5 , Rab21 , and Rab22 were used to pull down His - tagged APPL1 ( 5 (cid:1) 385 ) and ( 5 (cid:1) 419 ) fragments in the presence of GDP or GTP analog ( GppNHp ) . The results were analyzed with SDS – PAGE and anti - His Western blot . Structure of APPL1 BAR - PH domain G Zhu et al & 2007 European Molecular Biology Organization The EMBO Journal VOL 26 | NO 14 | 2007 3487 that APPL1 BAR domain alone ( residues 5 (cid:1) 265 ) cannot directly interact with Rab5 ( data not shown ) ( Miaczynska et al , 2004 ) . Furthermore , using different Rab5 truncation variants , we demonstrated that the N - terminus ( residues 1 (cid:1) 15 ) and C - terminus ( residues 185 (cid:1) 215 ) of Rab5 are dis - pensable for interaction with APPL1 ( Figure 4 ) . Binding afﬁnity between full - length Rab5 - Q79L and APPL1 ( 5 (cid:1) 419 ) was quantitatively determined in a surface plasmon resonance ( SPR ) experiment . Rab5 was coupled to the SPR biosensor chip in random orientations , and APPL1 ( 5 (cid:1) 419 ) was applied as the analyte at concentrations of 0 . 15 (cid:1) 12 m M ( Supplementary Figure 4 ) . The dissociation constant , k d , for the Rab5 (cid:1) APPL1 interaction measured from this experi - ment was 0 . 9 ( 7 0 . 7 ) m M , with k on and k off of 1 . 3 ( 7 0 . 6 ) (cid:4) 10 3 M (cid:1) 1 s (cid:1) 1 , and 1 . 2 ( 7 0 . 4 ) (cid:4) 10 (cid:1) 3 s (cid:1) 1 , respec - tively . This k d value is typical for an interaction between a Rab and its effectors ( Eathiraj et al , 2005 ) . A major Rab5 - binding site in the PH domain To identify Rab5 - binding site ( s ) in APPL1 , GST (cid:1) Rab5 - Q79L ( full length ) was used to pull down APPL1 variants having surface point mutations . The WT APPL1 ( 5 (cid:1) 419 ) fragment was used as the parental construct for the mutagenesis , because this fragment is easily distinguishable from GST (cid:1) Rab5 by size on SDS – PAGE gels without the need for Western blot analysis . A total of 31 point mutations were made at 27 distinct , solvent - exposed positions ( Figure 5 ; Supplementary Figures 1 and 3 ) , based on the structural information of BAR - PH motif . Most of these point mutations were located in the PH domain or near the BAR (cid:1) PH interface , which are the surface regions most conserved between APPL1 and APPL2 ( Supplementary Figure 5 ) . Substitution mutants were designed to maximize potential mutational effects on Rab5 binding ( e . g . , by ﬂipping charges or switching between hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues ) without dis - rupting the overall structure . In addition , the ﬂexible L1 loop ( residues 289 (cid:1) 294 ) was truncated and replaced with one Gly residue . All of these APPL1 variants , as well as the WT construct , were expressed in E . coli , with comparable yields from the soluble fractions ( data not shown ) , in contrast to the mutations at BAR (cid:1) PH interface mentioned earlier . This sug - gested that the thirty or so surface mutations had little effect on the stability of BAR - PH dimer . Among them , seven mu - tants , including V25D , N308D , M310K , A318D , G319R , L321D , and D324A , either abolished or signiﬁcantly reduced ( i . e . , retaining o 30 % ) Rab5 binding compared with the WT APPL1 ( Figure 5A ) . In the 3D structure , most of these residues cluster in an elongated surface area formed by b 3 , L3 , and b 4 of the PH domain , deﬁning a major Rab5 - binding site ( Figure 5B ; Supplementary Figure 3 ) . In addition , the effect of the V25D mutant suggests that the BAR domain also contributes to Rab binding either directly or indirectly . On the other hand , L1 loop seems not to be required for Rab5 binding ; signiﬁcance of the apparent , positive effect of the truncation mutant ( Figure 5A ) remains to be studied . We further extended these binding studies and conﬁrmed the above Rab5 - binding site in vivo in the cell , by monitoring Rab5 - mediated APPL1 recruitment to early endosomes in the cell via confocal microscopy . In this case , the RFP ( DsRed - monomer ) (cid:1) Rab5 - Q79L fusion protein was expressed in PC12 cells , targeted to the early endosomes , and recruited effectively the coexpressed GFP ( green ﬂuorescence protein ) (cid:1) APPL1 to these early endosomes ( Figure 5C ) . Importantly , APPL1 ( 5 (cid:1) 385 ) , that is , the BAR - PH domain , was sufﬁcient to target to Rab5 - Q79L containing early endo - somes ( Figure 5C ) . In contrast , one of the Rab5 - binding defective mutants ( A318D ) failed to target the early endo - somes and exhibited a diffused pattern throughout the cyto - plasm in the cell ( Figure 5C ) . Interaction between small GTPase and BAR domain has been exempliﬁed in a complex crystal structure of Rac and arfaptin2 before ( Tarricone et al , 2001 ) . Based on the follow - ing observations , however , we excluded the possibility of a Rac (cid:1) arfaptin2 - like binding mode for the Rab5 (cid:1) APPL1 inter - action . First , the linear dimension of Rab5 is less than 50A˚ , which is signiﬁcantly smaller than the distance ( B 60A˚ ) between the putative Rab5 - binding site in the PH domain and the central region of the BAR dimmer , where Rac binds with arfaptin2 . Second , the isolated APPL1 BAR domain did not bind to Rab5 in our pull - down assay . Third , we mutated APPL1 Asn52 , which is at the position equivalent to Rac - binding site in arfaptin2 , to either a smaller ( Ala ) or larger ( Arg ) side - chain residue , and the mutations showed no effect on the binding to Rab5 . APPL1 as a Rab21 effector Rab5 subfamily contains several members , including Rab5 , Rab21 , and Rab22 . Among them , Rab5 and Rab22 share a higher overall sequence identity with each other than with Rab21 ( Pereira - Leal and Seabra , 2000 ) . This difference was used to explain the ability of Rab5 and Rab22 , but not Rab21 , to share some common effectors such as EEA1 and rabeno - syn5 ( Kauppi et al , 2002 ; Eathiraj et al , 2005 ) . Therefore , we tested APPL1 binding speciﬁcity towards other members in the Rab5 subfamily , using GST (cid:1) Rab21 ( full length ) and GST (cid:1) Rab22 ( 2 (cid:1) 192 ) to pull down APPL1 ( 5 (cid:1) 419 ) . Interestingly , APPL1 would bind to Rab21 in a GTP - depen - dent manner ( Figure 4 ) , indicating that APPL1 is an effector for both Rab5 and Rab21 . On the other hand , we were unable to detect any binding between APPL1 and Rab22 in the pull - down assay ( Figure 4 ) . We could not rule out possible in vivo interaction between them because our recombinant Rab22 might not have folded correctly in E . coli based on the following observations : ( 1 ) the expression level of Rab22 was 10 - to 20 - fold lower than Rab5 and Rab21 , and ( 2 ) the GTP loading rate of Rab22 was lower too ( data not shown ) . Therefore , we focused our study on Rab5 and Rab21 for their interactions with APPL1 . We demonstrated that Rab21 and Rab5 have similar but not identical binding proﬁles towards APPL1 variants ( Figure 5 ) , which may be explained by their sequence divergence . This differential binding to Rab5 and Rab21 by APPL1 may allow in vivo analysis of the functional roles of each Rab (cid:1) APPL1 interaction , for example , by speci - ﬁcally abolishing one interaction while retaining others . A novel Rab effector binding mode between Rab5 and APPL1 Next we investigated the APPL1 - binding regions in Rab5 . Since residues responsible for APPL1 binding are likely to be located in the switch I , switch II , and interswitch regions , whose conformations change between different nucleotide binding states , these regions became the main objects of our investigation . In addition to relevant Rab5 mutations that we made in previous studies , several point mutations in the Rab5 Structure of APPL1 BAR - PH domain G Zhu et al The EMBO Journal VOL 26 | NO 14 | 2007 & 2007 European Molecular Biology Organization 3488 switch I region ( i . e . , residues 40 (cid:1) 53 ) were tested for APPL1 binding . We found that point mutations in the 42 (cid:1) 48 region signiﬁcantly reduced APPL1 binding , while L38R , Q49A , E50A , and I53N showed little or no detectable effect ( Figure 6A ) . Consistent with our previous structural studies on Rab5 – rabaptin5 interaction ( Zhu et al , 2004 ) , all muta - Figure 5 Mutational analyses of APPL1 . ( A ) Quantifying the Rab binding ability of APPL1 variants . The Rab5 - and Rab21 binding abilities of APPL1 variants relative to that of WTAPPL1 ( 5 (cid:1) 419 ) were estimated based on chemiluminescence - labeled Western blot ( see the Materials and methods ) and shown as the white and gray bars , respectively . Standard deviations calculated from multiple experiments were represented by the thin lines . ( B ) Mutational effects on binding to Rab5 and Rab21 . Distribution of point mutations is shown on the molecular surface of the BAR - PH dimer where the two protomers are colored gray and light green , respectively . APPL1 mutations that affect binding strongly ( i . e . , o 30 % binding comparing to WT ) are colored red ; otherwise , the mutants are colored blue . The position showing reversed binding property is colored yellow . Mutation positions are selectively labeled ; note that the PH domain contains residues 276 (cid:1) 379 . ( C ) Mutational effects on APPL1 targeting to Rab5 - positive early endosomes in the cell .

Shown are typical confocal microscopic images indicating the RFP (cid:1) Rab5 - Q79L labeled early endosomes ( red ) and the colocalization of GFP (cid:1) APPL1 or mutants ( green ) in the same cells . Scale bar , 16 m m . Structure of APPL1 BAR - PH domain G Zhu et al & 2007 European Molecular Biology Organization The EMBO Journal VOL 26 | NO 14 | 2007 3489 tions within the 38 (cid:1) 50 region did not interfere with Rab5 (cid:1) rabaptin5 binding ( Figure 6A ) . Furthermore , with the knowledge of crystal structures of Rab5 – rabaptin5 and Rab22 – rabenosyn5 complexes , it is clear that both Rab5 effectors rabaptin5 and rabenosyn5 bind to the so called invariant hydrophobic triad of Rab5 ( i . e . , Phe57 , Trp74 , and Tyr89 ) ( Merithew et al , 2001 ) . Mutation of any of these residues usually strongly inhibits the Rab - effector binding ( Zhu et al , 2004 ; Eathiraj et al , 2005 ) . Interestingly , in our mutagenesis analysis , the APPL1 - binding was affected by W74R and Y89R , but not by F57R point mutation in Rab5 ( Figure 6 ) . Taken together , our results indicate that APPL1 binds to Rab5 regions including the 40 (cid:1) 48 loop and switch II , B 30A˚ across . In addition , we showed that the two effectors , APPL1 and rapaptin5 , could compete for Rab5 - binding ( data not shown ) , conﬁrming that the binding sites of APPL1 and rabaptin5 on the Rab5 surface overlap with each other . To further deﬁne the Rab5 (cid:1) APPL1 binding mode , we performed extensive pull - down analyses between variants of Rab5 and APPL1 , looking for reversal mutants that could rescue the lost binding ability of others . We identiﬁed one such pair ; APPL1 - N308D abolished the binding to Rab5 , while Rab5 - L38R had no effect on APPL1 binding . However , Rab5 - L38R was found to bind with APPL1 - N308D , but not with the other tested APPL1 variants of similar hydrophobic - to - charged mutations , including V25D , A318D , and L321D ( Supplementary Figure 6 ) . This result suggests that Rab5 - L38R restores binding for APPL1 - N308D through complementary , electrostatic , yet speciﬁc interac - tions . It further implies that the position 308 in the b 3 strand of APPL1 PH domain is in the vicinity of position 38 in the a 1 helix of Rab5 in their complex . Discussion BAR - stabilized PH domain is essential for Rab5 binding Since both APPL1 and APPL2 bind to Rab5 , their Rab - binding sites are likely located in a surface region that is conserved between the two APPL proteins . There are no deletion / insertion differences in the BAR - PH region between them ( Supplementary Figure 1 ) , and an inspection of the APPL1 BAR - PH dimer surface indicates that the most conserved surface region is located on the PH domain surface and the BAR - PH junction ( Supplementary Figure 5 ) . Furthermore , neither PH domain ( Miaczynska et al , 2004 ) nor BAR domain alone ( data not shown ) can directly bind Rab5 , suggesting that the dimer interface between PH and BAR domains plays a critical role in Rab5 binding directly or indirectly . This binding mode between Rab5 and APPL1 is apparently distinct from that between Rac and arfaptin , which only requires BAR dimerization ( Tarricone et al , 2001 ) . To investigate further the structural basis of APPL1 and Rab5 interaction , we have performed extensive mutagenesis analyses . A BAR dimer breaking mutant ( F210D / F211D ) and the BAR (cid:1) PH interface mutant ( S16E / P17E ) are both insolu - ble when expressed in E . coli ( data not shown ) , supporting the notion that the functional form of APPL1 BAR - PH domain is a dimer . Importantly a series of surface point mutants are soluble , allowing us to analyze the in vitro binding properties between these APPL1 mutants and Rab5 ( Figure 5 ) . The results indicate that Rab5 speciﬁcally binds to the PH domain of APPL1 in the context of BAR - PH dimer , and this binding may marginally extend to the neighboring BAR domain . Our structure - functional analyses are consistent with existing biochemical data . For example , a previously reported triple mutation of APPL1 within the PH domain , K280E / Y283C / G319R , disrupts Rab5 binding ( Miaczynska et al , 2004 ) . This effect can be fully explained based on the importance of the BAR (cid:1) PH and PH (cid:1) Rab5 interfaces . Combined results from our mutagenesis pull - down experi - ments ( Figures 4 – 6 ) , crystal structures of the BAR - PH domain of APPL1 ( Figure 1 ) , and structures of GTPase domain of human Rab5 in different nucleotide binding modes ( Zhu et al , 2003 , 2004 ) clearly explain the requirement of GTP - bound Rab5 for APPL1 binding . Based on available information , we have modeled the interaction between the two proteins . With the assumption that both proteins remain rigid bodies , our complex model satisﬁes constraints imposed by the mutagen - esis pull - down results ( Figure 7 ) . Over 1200A˚ 2 SAS area combined from both the APPL1 dimer and Rab5 would be buried in their interface . In this putative Rab5 (cid:1) APPL1 bind - ing mode , APPL1 interface includes L2 , b 3 , L3 , and b 4 regions . Note that the L3 - b 4 region showed weak electron density in the crystal structure , indicating its higher mobility and possible adaptability in forming a complex with Rab5 . On the Rab5 side , two regions that harbor binding - defective mutations are involved in the complex formation : the loop 42 (cid:1) 48 and switch II ( Figure 6 ) . Furthermore , the reversal mutation pair , Rab5 - L38R and APPL1 - N308D ( Supplementary Figure 6 ) would directly interact with each other inside the interface of our complex model . The bound Rab5 molecules would extend the concave surface of the APPL1 dimer , with both the N - and C - termini of Rab5 exposed to solvent . Considering that there are about 30 residues C - terminal to our Rab5 model , which are necessary for membrane associa - Figure 6 Mutational analyses of Rab5 . ( A ) Pull - down assay on Rab5 variants . Point mutations in switch regions were introduced in the full - length Rab5 - Q79L background of the GST fusion con - struct . Each mutant was expressed in E . coli , puriﬁed , and equal amounts of each Rab5 sample was used to pull down recombinant proteins of His - tagged WT APPL1 ( 5 (cid:1) 419 ) ( top panel ) and His - tagged rabaptin5 ( 551 (cid:1) 862 ) ( bottom panel ) . The results were visualized by Coomassie blue stain . ( B ) Molecular surface model of Rab5 GTPase domain . Its N - terminus , switch I ( SW1 ) and switch II ( SW2 ) regions are labeled . Rab5 mutations that have effects and have no effect on binding are labeled red and blue , respectively . The position showing reversed binding property with the APPL1 N308D mutant is colored yellow . Structure of APPL1 BAR - PH domain G Zhu et al The EMBO Journal VOL 26 | NO 14 | 2007 & 2007 European Molecular Biology Organization 3490 tion but excluded from the crystallography study , our model would allow Rab5 molecules to anchor to the membrane through the added C - terminal tails and to interact with APPL1 at both ends of the BAR - PH dimer ( Figure 7 ) . The Rab5 C - terminal tail is likely ﬂexible , supporting that recruitment of APPL1 to the endocytic vesicle may not require its direct contact with the membrane . In the complex , the Rab5 mole - cule does not block the C - terminus of the PH domain , allowing peptide extension of the APPL1 molecule from the BAR - PH domain . Rab5 – APPL1 interaction represents a novel Rab effector binding mode In contrast to the a - helix dominant Rab - binding motifs of all other effectors of known 3D structures ( Ostermeier and Brunger , 1999 ; Zhu et al , 2004 ; Eathiraj et al , 2005 ; Wu et al , 2005 ; Wei et al , 2006 ) , the Rab5 - binding motif of APPL1 is mainly composed of two b - strands , b 3 and b 4 , and their connecting loop L3 . Although the exact binding position on the Rab protein and orientation of the effector helices may differ among available complex structures , all these Rab - binding domains interact with the invariant hydro - phobic triad . However , we have identiﬁed a Rab5 mutation in the hydrophobic triad , F57R , that does not interfere with APPL1 binding , but abolishes the binding to another Rab5 effector , rabaptin5 ( Figure 6A ; Zhu et al , 2004 ) . In contrast , several point mutations in the switch I region of Rab5 affect the binding of APPL1 but not rabaptin5 . The 42 (cid:1) 48 region in Rab5 has not been previously reported to be involved in effector binding . GTPase binding has emerged as a major function of PH domains in addition to lipid binding ( Lemmon , 2004 ) . For example , PH domains in some guanine nucleotide - exchange factors ( GEF ) have been shown to bind directly to their cognate small GTPases ( Rossman et al , 2002 , 2003 ; Lu et al , 2004 ) , and our data now show direct interaction between the APPL1 PH domain and Rab5 . So far , only two crystal struc - tures of small GTPase (cid:1) PH domain complexes are available . One is Ran (cid:1) RanBD1 ( PDB ﬁle 1RRP ) . The interactions between the Ran GTPase domain and RanBD1 PH core domain is fairly minor , occurring between the switch I region of the GTPase ( equivalent to the 40’s in Rab5 ) and strand b 2 of the PH domain . This interaction alone is unlikely to be sufﬁcient to form a stable complex . Indeed , Ran has a long C - terminal peptide beside the GTPase domain , while the PH domain of RanBD1 has an extra N - terminal peptide . These two terminal peptides wrap around the partner proteins forming the major interaction between Ran and RanBD1 . Such an interaction seems not to be required for Rab5 and APPL1 , because the GTPase domain of Rab5 and BAR - PH domain of APPL1 are sufﬁcient to mediate their interaction . The second published small GTPase (cid:1) PH complex is that of Ral (cid:1) Exo84 ( PDB ﬁle 1ZC3 ) . In this complex , the PH domain of Exo84 uses L1 , b 5 , and L6 to interact with the interswitch and switch II regions of Ral forming an intermolecular b - sheet extension mediated by the PH b 5 strand and GTPase b 2 strand ( Jin et al , 2005 ) . Our mutagenesis analysis points to a different surface region ( b 3 , L3 , and b 4 ) of the PH domain for Rab5 binding . Therefore , the Rab5 (cid:1) APPL1 inter - action represents a new GTPase (cid:1) PH binding mode . APPL1 is a representative of BAR - PH containing proteins Both APPL1 and APPL2 are identiﬁed as Rab5 effectors , and their overall aa sequences are highly homologous . In parti - cular , residues on the APPL1 BAR dimer interface , BAR (cid:1) PH interface , and the presence of the a 4 helix seem well con - served in APPL2 ( Supplementary Figure 5 ) . Therefore , APPL2 BAR - PH domain most likely forms a homodimer very similar to that of APPL1 . Furthermore , these conserved structural features may also extend to other BAR - PH containing proteins ( Supplementary Figure 1 ; Habermann , 2004 ) . For instance , no helix breaking aa sequence appears in the middle of their predicted a 4 regions . Based on the APPL1 BAR - PH crystal structure , we ﬁnd that , in general , the PH domain is more conserved than the BAR domain , and most of the highly conserved positions are located closer to the BAR (cid:1) PH inter - face rather than the central region of the symmetric dimer . For example , the two major contact regions between PH and BAR domains ( i . e . , D 15 SPxxR 20 and D 334 xxDRRYCF 342 ) are conserved at the aa sequence level among BAR - PH containing proteins . In addition , correlated mutations are present bet - ween these proteins at the BAR (cid:1) PH interface . Thus , we propose that all BAR - PH containing proteins share similar 3D structures in the corresponding regions and that the BAR - PH motif may function as a general structural unit to interact with membrane - bound proteins and other molecular moieties . In some BAR containing proteins , it is proposed that there exists an amphipathic helix N - terminal to the a 1 helix of BAR domain , and they are called an N - BAR motif ( Peter et al , 2004 ; Gallop et al , 2006 ) . It is suggested that this extra N - terminal region facilitates membrane binding ( or bending ) . A similar N - BAR structure was predicted for APPL1 and APPL2 ( Habermann , 2004 ) , but our current APPL1 crystal structure does not show such a structural motif . Instead , the N - terminal region assumes an extended conformation and packs in the groove formed between helices a 1 and a 3 on the convex side of the crescent - shaped dimer ( Figure 3C ) . Since the N - terminal regions of the other BAR - PH containing pro - teins ( Supplementary Figure 1 ) share similar sequences , we suggest that none of these proteins contains an N - BAR motif in their 3D structure .

( B ) Membrane recruitment of APPL1 mediated by Rab5 . The APPL1 BAR - PH protomers are colored gray and yellow , and APPL1 C - terminal peptides are represented by ovals .

Structure of APPL1 BAR - PH domain G Zhu et al & 2007 European Molecular Biology Organization The EMBO Journal VOL 26 | NO 14 | 2007 3491 Lacking both the amphipathic helix N - terminal to the BAR domain and the lipid - binding motif in the PH domain ( Supplementary Figure 1 ) may explain the Rab5 - dependent membrane association of APPL1 . In contrast , the PH domains of centaurin - b 1 / 2 contain the key , basic residues for phos - phoinositide binding ( Dinitto and Lambright , 2006 ; Supplementary Figure 1 ) . If their PH domains are oriented similarly to that in the APPL1 dimer , the canonical ( i . e . , L1 – L3 – L6 ) , ligand - binding triangle in their PH domains likely contributes to direct membrane association of these proteins . Functional implications of the BAR - PH structure While it is suggested that Rab5 (cid:1) APPL1 interaction mediates a signal transduction pathway between the plasma membrane and the nucleus , the mechanism by which Rab5 binding stimulates APPL1 translocation to the nucleus remains elu - sive . The current BAR - PH structure may help to clarify the mechanism . Interestingly , the sequence of ‘PKKKENE’ was identiﬁed in the BAR domain of APPL2 as a potential nuclear localization signal ( Miaczynska et al , 2004 ) . The correspond - ing region in APPL1 is the solvent exposed loop connecting a 2 and a 3 at the tip of the dimer ( Figure 1B ) and has a fairly conserved sequence ( Supplementary Figure 1 ) . In addition , our preliminary data suggest that there is no detectable binding between the BAR - PH domain and the C - terminal region of APPL1 ( data not shown ) , which makes it unlikely that Rab5 may regulate APPL1 through interference with the intramolecular interaction of the latter . It seems more prob - able that the Rab5 (cid:1) APPL1 complex recruits downstream effectors to propagate the signal transduction process . Unlike other Rab effectors , APPL1 / 2 proteins function in the signaling pathway from the so - called signaling endosome to nucleus . Our data show that APPL1 interacts with the Rab5 protein using a novel binding mode ; it remains to be proven whether such a binding mode is essential for APPL1 function . Whereas it has been shown that APPL1 does not bind other Rab proteins miscellaneously ( Miaczynska et al , 2004 ) , we demonstrate that APPL1 is also an effector of Rab21 , indicat - ing that APPL1 adopts a binding mode shared by both Rab5 and Rab21 . It raises the possibility that , besides Rab5 , other members of this Rab subfamily may also be involved in the APPL1 signaling pathway . Materials and methods Protein expression and puriﬁcation Constructs of human APPL1 ( GenBank ID : NP _ 036228 ) ( 5 (cid:1) 265 ) ( i . e . , the BAR domain ) and APPL1 ( 5 (cid:1) 385 ) ( i . e . , the BAR - PH domain ) were inserted into the vectors pET28a and pET15b ( Novagen ) , respectively , between Nde I and Bam HI restriction sites . The N - terminal few residues in the native sequence are hydrophobic and were deleted in an attempt to improve the solubility . Point mutations were introduced into the pET15b - APPL1 ( 5 (cid:1) 419 ) parental construct using Quick - Change TM site - directed mutagenesis kit ( Stratagene ) . His - tagged proteins of APPL1 ( 5 (cid:1) 265 ) and APPL1 ( 5 (cid:1) 385 ) were expressed as soluble recombinant proteins in BL21 Star TM ( DE3 ) strain of E . coli ( Invitrogen ) , and cells were harvested after induction with 0 . 1mM isopropyl - b - D - thiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG ) for 8h at 25 1 C . The cells were lysed with lysozyme , and the lysate supernatant was puriﬁed with His - Select TM afﬁnity beads ( Sigma ) . In both cases , the His tag was removed with thrombin . After further puriﬁcation with Resource - Q TM anion - exchange chromatography ( GE Healthcare ) , both protein samples were concentrated to B 30mgml (cid:1) 1 in ( 20mM Tris – HCl ( pH 8 . 0 ) and 0 . 1 % ( v / v ) b - mercaptoethanol ( b ME ) ) and stored at (cid:1) 85 1 C until needed . APPL1 ( 5 (cid:1) 419 ) mutants were expressed similarly . Se - Met - substituted proteins were expressed in E . coli B834 ( DE3 ) pLysS cells ( Novagen ) in minimal media supplemented with 40mgl (cid:1) 1 Se - Met ( Sigma ) and puriﬁed using the same procedure as the native protein . Recombinant proteins of human Rab5a variants ( GenBank ID : NM _ 004162 ) , human Rab21 ( BC021901 ) , and human Rab22a ( NM _ 020673 ) fused with an N - terminal GST were expressed in BL21 E . coli and puriﬁed with GST - afﬁnity chromatography . The sample was concentrated to B 20mgml (cid:1) 1 and stored in 1 (cid:4) phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) with 0 . 1 % ( v / v ) b ME at (cid:1) 80 1 C . Recombinant protein of human rabaptin5 ( 551 – 862 ) ( GenBank ID : CAA62580 ) was expressed and puriﬁed as described previously ( Zhai et al , 2003 ) ; two additional point mutations , C719S and C734S , were introduced to reduce aggregation . Protein crystallization and data collection Crystals of APPL1 ( 5 – 265 ) were grown at 20 1 C with the hanging drop vapor diffusion method . The Se - Met incorporated protein sample diluted to 10 – 20mgml (cid:1) 1 was mixed 1 : 1 ( v / v ) with the reservoir solution of 0 . 1M magnesium formate and 0 . 1 % ( v / v ) b ME . Crystals were transferred to a cryo - protectant solution of ( 88 % saturated Li 2 SO 4 , 14mM magnesium formate , 20mM Tris – HCl ( pH 8 . 0 ) , and 0 . 1 % ( v / v ) b ME ) by gradually changing the drop solution in 20min , followed by cooling in liquid nitrogen . A data set was collected at selenium edge at sector 22 BM of the Argonne APS facility . Crystals of APPL1 ( 5 – 385 ) were also grown in hanging drops at 20 1 C . The reservoir contained 6 % ( w / v ) polyethylene glycol 6000 ( PEG6K ) , 0 . 6M NaCl , and 0 . 1 % ( v / v ) b ME . The crystals were quickly soaked in a solution of ( 7 . 5 % ( w / v ) PEG6K , 0 . 25M NaCl , and 10 % ( v / v ) glycerol ) and ﬂash - cooled under liquid nitrogen . Both native and SAD data sets were collected at the APS facility . Analyzing the crystal content by SDS – PAGE conﬁrmed the integrity of the protein sample . All data were processed with the program suite HKL2000 . Pull - down assay for analyzing protein – protein interactions In the Rab5 (cid:1) APPL1 pull - down experiment , 30 m g GST (cid:1) Rab fusion protein ( 52kDa ) was incubated with 60 m l of 30 % slurry of GSH – Sepharose 4B ( GE Healthcare ) at 22 1 C for 30min . Nucleotide loading reaction was performed on the GSH beads in an exchange buffer of ( 1 (cid:4) PBS , 2mM DTT , 1mM MgCl 2 , 4mM EDTA , and 400 m M GppNHp or GDP ) at 22 1 C for 30min . Increasing the magnesium ion concentration to 20mM terminated the loading reaction . Soluble fractions of cell lysate containing all His - tagged APPL1 ( 5 – 419 ) variants were analyzed by SDS – PAGE to conﬁrm their comparable expression level and solubility . The GSH resin carrying nucleotide - loaded GST (cid:1) Rab fusion protein was incubated with B 50 m l cell lysate ( B 200 m g APPL1 variant , 50kDa ) at 22 1 C for 30min , then washed three times with 200 m l of ( 1 (cid:4) PBS , 2mM DTT , and 4mM MgCl 2 ) and resuspended in 20 m l of 2 (cid:4) reducing SDS sample buffer . The sample was subjected to SDS – PAGE analysis , visualized with Coomassie blue stain . The same samples were analyzed with chemiluminescence Western blot ( GE Healthcare ) and His - tag anti - body then detected on ﬁlms which were semi - quantiﬁed using the computer software ImageJ ( http : / / rsb . info . nih . gov / ij / ) including its default calibration .
