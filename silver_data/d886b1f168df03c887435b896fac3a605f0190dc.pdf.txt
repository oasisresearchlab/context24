Here we investigated the role of SLK in chemotaxis downstream of the tyrosine kinase receptor , HER2 / ErbB2 / Neu , which is frequently over - expressed in human breast cancers . Our results show that SLK is required for the efﬁcient cell migration of human and mouse mammary epithelial cell lines in the presence of the Neu activator , heregulin , as a chemoattractant . SLK activity is stimulated by heregulin treatment or by overexpression of activated Neu . Phosphorylation of tyrosine 1201 or tyrosines 1226 / 7 on Neu is a key event for SLK activation and cell migration , and cancer cell invasion mediated by these tyrosines is inhibited by kinase - inactive SLK . Signaling pathway inhibitors show that Neu - mediated SLK activation is dependent on MEK , PI3K , PLC c and Shc signaling . Furthermore , heregulin - stimulated SLK activity requires signals from the focal adhesion proteins , FAK and src . Finally , phospho - FAK analysis shows that SLK is required for Neu - dependent focal adhesion turnover . Together , these studies deﬁne an interaction between Neu and SLK signaling in the regulation of cancer cell motility . Oncogene ( 2009 ) 28 , 2839 – 2848 ; doi : 10 . 1038 / onc . 2009 . 146 ; published online 15 June 2009 Keywords : cell migration ; focal adhesion ; Ste20 - like kinase ; ErbB2 ; HER2 Introduction ErbB - 2 ( HER2 / Neu ) , a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase family , is over - expressed in B 30 % of primary human breast cancers ( reviewed Mansour et al . , 1994 ; Dankort and Muller , 2000 ) . It is also believed that HER2 overexpression leads to an aggressive tumor phenotype as high levels of HER2 expression are observed in many invasive human ductal carcinomas , but rarely observed in benign breast disorders . Patients with cancer whose tumors over - express HER2 receptors tend to have a more metastatic disease predicting a poor prognosis ( Mansour et al . , 1994 ; Hynes and Lane , 2005 ) . Transgenic studies have provided direct evidence supporting a role for HER2 in mammary tumorigenesis . Mice expressing a mouse mammary tumor virus - driven activated Neu , the rat homolog of HER2 , rapidly develop mammary tumors that histologically resemble human breast carcinomas overexpressing HER2 ( Guy et al . , 1992 ; Dankort and Muller , 1996 ; Siegel et al . , 2000 ) . Activation of HER2 / ErbB2 / Neu ( referred hereafter as Neu ) intrinsic kinase activity induces the trans - phosphorylation of speciﬁc tyrosine residues within the cytoplasmic tail of the receptor . Mutation of these tyrosines results in a dramatic impairment of the transforming potential of an activated Neu . Reversion of any one of four mutated sites to tyrosines ( Tyr1144 , YB ; Tyr1201 , YC ; Tyr1227 , YD ; or Tyr1253 , YE ) restores transforming activity ( Dankort et al . , 1997 ) . Distinct docking proteins are recruited to these different tyrosines on Neu and provide links to the Ras / MAPK - , PI3K - and Src - dependent signaling pathways . The transforming ability of NeuNT - YB and NeuNT - YD mutants is correlated with their ability to bind Grb2 and Shc adapter molecules , respectively ( Dankort et al . , 2001a , b ) . Neu is also implicated in many steps required for metastasis ( Holbro et al . , 2003 ; Holbro and Hynes , 2004 ) . Distinct autophosphorylations , including YC , YD and YE , were shown to mediate the epithelial – mesenchymal transition induced by an activated Neu receptor in Madin – Darby canine kidney epithelial cells , namely the YC , YD and YE sites ( Khoury et al . , 2001 ) . Interestingly , focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) signaling is critical for Neu transformation and invasion ( Benli - mame et al . , 2005 ) . Activation of MAPK , PI3K and Src are required for ErbB2 - dependent lamellipodia forma - tion and for motility of breast carcinoma cells ( Marone et al . , 2004 ) . However , stimulation of these signals fails to induce efﬁcient cell migration in the absence of Neu phosphorylation at the YC or YD site ( Marone et al . , 2004 ) . Recently , Memo ( mediator of ErbB2 - driven motility ) was found to interact with phospho - YD through the Shc adaptor protein , coupling Neu to the microtubule network ( Marone et al . , 2004 ) .

The Ste20 - like kinase , SLK , is a GCK - related kinase that shares extensive homology with a lymphocyte - speciﬁc kinase , LOK ( Kuramochi et al . , 1997 ) . SLK is ubiquitously expressed in adult tissues and cell lines ( Sabourin and Rudnicki , 1999 ) and is restricted to the neurogenic and myogenic lineages in the early embryo ( Zhang et al . , 2002 ) . To date , SLK homologs and splice variants have been reported by different groups ( Itoh et al . , 1997 ; Pytowski et al . , 1998 ; Yamada et al . , 2000 ) . Initial characterization showed that SLK overexpression leads to actin stress ﬁber dissolution and induction of apoptosis ( Sabourin and Rudnicki , 1999 ; Sabourin et al . , 2000 ) . SLK indirectly associates with the microtubule network and can induce stress ﬁber break - down that can be partially rescued by inactive Rac1 ( Wagner et al . , 2002 ) . SLK is also required for cell - cycle progression through G2 / M phase ( O’Reilly et al . , 2005 ) . A role for SLK in Plk1 activation during the cell cycle has been recently suggested ( Ellinger - Ziegelbauer et al . , 2000 ) . Supporting this , SLK was found to be important for microtubule radial array orientation ( Burakov et al . , 2008 ) . Recently , we have shown that scratch wounding promotes the recruitment of SLK to the leading edge of migrating cells moving into the injury and stimulates SLK kinase activity through the activation of FAK / src / MAPK ( Wagner et al . , 2008 ) . Furthermore , SLK is required for cell migration in Boyden chamber hapto - taxis assays and microtubule - dependent focal adhesion turnover ( Wagner et al . , 2008 ) . Here we provide evidence that SLK is a novel mediator of cell migration downstream of Neu . Through two of its autophosphorylation sites , Neu stimulates MEK - , PI3K - and PLC g - dependent SLK activation , required to destabilize focal adhesions during Neu - mediated cell motility . Results Neu receptor signaling stimulates SLK activity It is well known that integrin and growth factor receptors activate many of the same signaling pathways . We have recently shown that SLK is activated by scratch wounding downstream of FAK and is required for haptotaxis on ﬁbronectin - coated matrices ( Wagner et al . , 2008 ) . As cross - talk between growth factor receptors and FAK has been shown , we investigated whether SLK is required for Neu - driven motility . Heregulin ( HRG ) activates Neu / ErbB2 signaling by binding to ErbB3 and ErbB4 , and results in the preferential formation of active Neu - containing hetero - dimers . We ﬁrst investigated whether the SLK activity could be modulated by activated Neu and HRG b in various cell lines . The T47D human breast carcinoma cell line expresses moderate levels of HER2 and migrates in response to HRG b ( Marone et al . , 2004 ) . The T47D - 5R cell line expresses an anti - human HER2 single - chain antibody resulting in trapping of the endogenous receptor in the Q1 endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) ( Beerli et al . , 1994 ; Marone et al . , 2004 ) . As shown in Figure 1 , stimulation of T47D cells resulted in a marked SLK activation . In contrast , no activation was observed in T47D - 5R cell line , in which the HER2 receptor does not get exported to the membrane . Supporting this , little or no activation was observed in murine NMuMG breast epithelium expressing low levels of Neu ( Figure 1b ) . However , a dramatic upregulation of SLK was seen in the mouse breast cancer cell line , 4T1 , that expresses high levels of ErbB2 / Neu ( Figure 1b ) . Interestingly , the basal level of SLK activity was also higher in 4T1 cells . Similarly , overexpression of activated Neu ( NeuNT ) , bearing a valine to glutamic acid mutation ( V64E ) , was sufﬁcient to upregulate SLK activity in the absence of HRG stimulation in HeLa and NIH3T3 cells ( Figure 1c ) . Although our SLK polyclonal antibody does not efﬁciently precipitate human SLK , we have observed elevated kinase activity in MCF - 7 ( human breast adenocarcinoma cell line ) cells ( Figure 1d ) but only a modest increase in MDA - MB - 231 or Sk - Br - 3 cells . One possibility is that SLK is regulated differently in these tumor cell lines , perhaps requiring HER2 receptor stimulation in MDA - MB - 231 and Sk - Br - 3 cells . Together , these results suggest that HER2 / Neu / ErbB2 activation or overexpression induces SLK activity in breast cancer cell lines . Inactivation of SLK inhibits Neu - mediated cell migration We next investigated the role of SLK in HRG - mediated chemotaxis using collagen - based Transwells and HRG b 1 . A dominant - negative version of SLK consist - ing of a kinase inactive catalytic domain ( aa 1 – 373 with a K63R mutation ; HA - K D C ) was expressed in the various cell lines by adenoviral infection . Control infections were also performed using a green ﬂuorescent protein ( GFP ) - expressing vector . Expression of HA - K D C in T47D cells attenuated HRG - induced cell migration by B 75 % compared to GFP - expressing ( control ) cells ( Figure 2a ) . As for the kinase activity assays , no effect was observed on the chemotactic ability of the T47D - 5R derivative . Similarly , we tested the effect of DN - SLK on human breast cancer cell lines expressing different levels of HER2 . The expression of HA - K D C also resulted in the inhibition of chemotaxis in MCF - 7 , MDA - MB - 231 and Sk - Br - 3 cells ( Figure 2b ) . Interestingly , the basal level of haptotaxis was also reduced by HA - K D C in MDA - MB - 231 and Sk - Br - 3 cells , supporting our previous observations ( Wagner et al . , 2008 ) . One possibility is that the higher levels of HER2 expression in these cells are sufﬁcient to increase their migration in the absence of HRG b , which can be suppressed by DN - SLK . Supporting these observations , adenovirus - mediated expression of a murine SLK short hairpin RNA in 4T1 cells also resulted in a marked inhibition of HRG - driven chemotaxis and haptotaxis in ErbB2 - mediated cell migration requires SLK K Roovers et al 2840 Oncogene the non - stimulated cells ( Figure 2c ) . Together , these data support a role for SLK in HER2 / Neu / ErbB2 - driven cell migration . Autophosphorylation of Neu on tyrosine 1201 and tyrosine 1226 / 7 are required for SLK activation Activation of the Neu receptor induces the trans - phosphorylation of numerous tyrosines on the cyto - plasmic tail creating docking sites for signaling adapter proteins . We examined the contribution of these sites to SLK activation and cell migration using NMuMG breast epithelium stably expressing a panel of activated Neu ( NeuNT ) mutants ( Dankort et al . , 2001a ) . There - fore , NeuNT , a Neu phosphorylation - deﬁcient mutant ( NYPD ) where phenylalanine has been substituted for each of the ﬁve tyrosine autophosphorylation sites , and a series of NeuNT add - back mutants , in which each tyrosine is restored individually ( YA through YE , corresponding to tyrosines Y1028 , Y1144 , Y1201 , Y1227 and Y1253 ) , were transfected in NMuMG cells . The stable pools were ﬂow sorted for similar levels of Neu expression , serum - starved and stimulated with HRG b . As previously reported , tyrosine residues 1201 ( YC ) and 1227 / 26 ( YD ) efﬁciently coupled the Neu / Neu receptor to the motility system ( Figure 3b ) ( Marone et al . , 2004 ) . Supporting a role for these docking sites in cell motility , they were also found to mediate SLK activation after HRG b stimulation and in vitro kinase assays ( Figure 3a ) . Identical results were observed in transiently transfected HeLa cells ( data not shown ) . Although the YE site could partially induce SLK activity , it did not signiﬁcantly contribute to HRG - induced motility , suggesting that SLK can also be stimulated by additional pathways . These results suggest that SLK activation is coupled to Neu through three phosphotyrosine docking sites , namely Y1201 , Y1226 / 27 and Y1251 . With regard to human and murine breast cancer cell lines , SLK knockdown in NMuMG cells expressing activated Neu resulted in a marked inhibition of HRG - induced chemotaxis ( Figure 4a ) . In addition , inhibition of haptotaxis was also observed in the absence of HRG stimulation . More importantly , SLK knockdown also leads to a marked decrease in the invasive potential of NeuNT - expressing NMuMG cells in matrigel invasion assays ( Figure 4b ) . Neu - mediated SLK activation requires the MEK , PI3K and PLC g signaling pathways Recent studies have shown that activation of the MAPK , p38 , PI3K and PLC g pathways are necessary but not sufﬁcient for Neu - induced cell motility ( Marone et al . , 2004 ) . Therefore , to investigate the signaling Figure 1 Neu / HER2 stimulation induces SLK kinase activity . ( a ) T47D and T47D - 5R cells were serum starved and stimulated with 1n M HRG b for 2h . SLK kinase activity was assayed by immunoprecipitation and in vitro autophosphorylation as described in Materials and methods . Transferred kinase assays were probed back with anti - SLK to assess the efﬁciency of the IPs . Whole - cell lysate ( WCL ) was also surveyed for Neu expression . Phospho - Neu ( pNeu ) is apparent in the T47D cells but undetectable in the 5R cells in which Neu is retained in the ER . Kinase assays and SLK westerns were subjected to Image J densitometry , and kinase activity was normalized to total SLK levels . ( b ) HRG b stimulation was performed as in panel a on murine 4T1 breast carcinomas and NMuMG breast epithelium . ( c ) HeLa cells and NIH3T3 ﬁbroblasts were transiently co - transfected with an activated Neu ( NeuNT ) and HA - SLK . At 24h later , HA - SLK was immunoprecipitated and assayed for kinase activity . SLK was found to be activated in the presence of NeuNT without further stimulation by HRG b . ( d ) SLK was immunoprecipitated from various human breast cell lines and assayed for kinase activity in vitro . ErbB2 - mediated cell migration requires SLK K Roovers et al 2841 Oncogene Figure 2 SLK is required for Neu - driven motility . ( a ) Serum - starved T47D and T47D - 5R cells were infected with adenovirus carrying dominant - negative SLK ( HA - K D C ) or GFP and plated in collagen - coated Transwell chambers . Chemotactic assays were initiated by adding HRG b to the bottom chamber . After 24h , the ﬁlters were stained with DAPI and the cells were counted using ﬂuorescent microscopy . Expression of the HA - tagged kinase is shown on the side panel . ( b ) All three cell lines were infected and subjected to chemotaxis assays as in panel a . Expression was also conﬁrmed by western blotting ( data not shown ) . ( c ) Murine 4T1 cells were infected with adenovirus carrying shSLK or a scrambled control and subjected to HRG b chemotaxis assays as described above . The SLK knockdown is shown on the left panel . All assays were performed in triplicate in three independent experiments . Similar results were obtained when the cells were plated in ﬁbronectin - coated supports ( data not shown ) . * P o 0 . 01 ; * * P o 0 . 005 . ErbB2 - mediated cell migration requires SLK K Roovers et al 2842 Oncogene systems involved in SLK activation downstream of NeuNT , YC and YD , we treated NMuMG Neu mutant cell lines with HRG in the presence of speciﬁc pharmacological inhibitors . Sub - conﬂuent cultures were pre - incubated with PP2 , U0126 , SB203580 , LY294002 and U - 73122 to inhibit src - family kinases , MEK1 , p38 , PI3K and PLC g , respectively . Interestingly , inhibition of src family kinases ( SFK ) by PP2 resulted in a failure to activate SLK after HRG treatment of all three different NMuMG cell lines , suggesting that SFK are required for SLK activation ( Figure 5a ) . No effect was observed with the inactive analog PP3 . Similarly , no SLK activation was observed in the presence of the MEK1 inhibitor U0126 , suggesting a requirement for the MAPK pathway . This was also previously observed in haptotaxis studies in mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts ( Wagner et al . , 2008 ) . Interestingly , regard - less of the NeuNT mutation , inhibition of p38 had no effect on SLK activation ( Figure 5a ) , suggesting that the potential role of p38 in motility does not involve SLK regulation . However , inhibition of either PI3K or PLC g resulted in partial SLK activation in NeuNT - expressing cells . To further dissect these systems , PI3K and PLC g were inhibited in the YC - and YD - expressing cultures . Inhibition of PI3K in YC - expressing cells still lead to SLK activation , whereas inhibition in YD cultures resulted in poor activation . Supporting a differential signaling role for these tyrosine residues , inhibition of PLC g in YC , but not YD cultures , failed to activate SLK . Overall , these results suggest that at least four signaling systems may be contributing to SLK activation : an SFK - dependent system and MAPK - , PI3K - and PLC g - dependent pathways . Whether those are indepen - dent or part of the same cascade remains to be elucidated . Figure 3 SLK is activated by NeuNT YC and NeuNT YD . ( a ) Neu - ﬂow - sorted NMuMG cells expressing various tyrosine add - back mutants were assessed for SLK kinase activity after HRG b stimulation . Kinase assays and SLK westerns were subjected to Image J densitometry , and kinase activity was normalized to total SLK levels . ( b ) The same cells as in panel a were subjected to HRG b chemotaxis assays . NeuNT YC and NeuNT YD mutants were found to be important for chemotaxis and SLK activation . Figure 4 SLK knockdown impairs matrigel invasion of NeuNT - expressing cells . ( a ) The NMuMG cells expressing NeuNT or the signaling - deﬁcient mutant NYPD were transfected with SLK siRNA or a non - targeting control and subjected to chemotaxis assays . A marked reduction in chemotaxis was observed upon SLK depletion . ( b ) The same cell preparation as in panel a was also subjected to matrigel invasion assays in the presence of HRG b . A marked reduction in invasion was observed after SLK knockdown . ( c ) SLK knockdown was conﬁrmed by western blot analysis . * P o 0 . 01 ; * * P o 0 . 005 . ErbB2 - mediated cell migration requires SLK K Roovers et al 2843 Oncogene Previous reports have highlighted growth factor receptor cross - talk with FAK and adhesion signaling ( Sieg et al . , 2000 ; Hauck et al . , 2001 ) . Importantly , the oncogenic and invasive potential of the ErbB3 / Erb2 heterodimer was recently shown to be dependent on FAK expression ( Benlimame et al . , 2005 ; Lahlou et al . , 2007 ) . Similarly , we have recently shown that SLK activation by haptotactic signals is FAK - dependent ( Wagner et al . , 2008 ) . Therefore , we tested the require - ment for FAK in Neu - mediated SLK activation . FAK - null ﬁbroblasts were stably transfected with NeuNYPD or NeuNT and compared for SLK activity after HRG stimulation . Comparison of the NT expressing cells for SLK activity showed that in the presence of FAK , SLK activity was markedly increased relative to FAK - null cells ( Figure 5b ) . Similar results were obtained in cells lacking the SFKs but expressing the NeuNT construct . Re - expression of c - src restored SLK activity in the presence of HRG b , suggesting that SFK are required for SLK activation downstream of Neu stimulation . Together , these results strongly suggest that FAK signaling is necessary for Neu - mediated SLK activation . The docking of the signaling adapter , Shc , on the YC and YD sites has been previously reported ( Dankort et al . , 2001b ; Hynes and Lane , 2005 ) . To test the requirement of ShcA in SLK activation , NMuMG cells expressing the Neu - YC or YD mutant were subjected to ShcA knockdowns and then stimulated with HRG b . SLK activity was then assessed by in vitro kinase assays . As shown in Figure 6 , ShcA signaling from the YC site was required for SLK activation by HRG b . Although SLK activation was observed with the YD site in the context of ShcA downregulation , SLK activity was found to be reduced by B 50 % . These results suggest that ShcA - dependent signals from the YC site are necessary and may cooperate with YD signals such as PLC g . Neu - SLK signaling induces focal adhesion turnover The process of cell migration requires the dynamic assembly and disassembly of focal adhesions ( Webb et al . , 2002 , 2004 ; Broussard et al . , 2008 ; Siesser et al . , 2008 ) . This turnover is associated with dynamic changes in the tyrosine and serine phosphorylation status of key molecules , such as FAK and paxillin . We recently reported that SLK is required for microtubule - depen - dent focal adhesion turnover during cell migration ( Wagner et al . , 2008 ) . To investigate whether SLK plays a role in focal adhesion dynamics downstream of Neu activation , NMuMG cells expressing the various Neu mutants were infected with GFP control or kinase - Figure 5 SLK activation is mediated by multiple pathways . ( a ) NMuMG cells expressing NeuNT , YC or YD were serum - starved and pretreated with various inhibitors as described in Materials and methods and then stimulated with HRG b for 2h . SLK kinase activity was assessed as above . The src family kinases ( SFKs ) and the MAPK pathway were found to be required for full SLK activation . Partial activation was observed when PI3K or PLC g was inhibited in NeuNT - expressing cells . Contribution from the PI3K pathway requires the YD site , whereas PLC g proceeds through the YC residue . ( b ) NeuNT ( NT ) or NYPD ( PD ) vectors were stably transfected in FAK - null and wild - type cells , as well as in Src / Yes / Fyn - deﬁcient cells and src - reconstituted cells . SLK activity was compared after HRG b stimulation . SLK activity was markedly reduced in the absence of FAK and the SFKs . ErbB2 - mediated cell migration requires SLK K Roovers et al 2844 Oncogene inactive SLK expressing adenoviruses and monitored for focal adhesion dynamics after HRG b treatment . The level of FAK phosphorylation at tyrosine 397 has been shown to correlate with adhesion turnover , as high levels are indicative of stable adhesions ( Cook et al . , 1998 ; Palazzo et al . , 2001 ; Webb et al . , 2002 ; Hamadi et al . , 2005 ) . We ﬁrst evaluated the levels of phospho - FAK - Y397 in NeuNT - or NYPD - expressing cells after infection with a dominant - negative SLK . Supporting our previous observations , expression of kinase - inactive SLK resulted in a marked increase in the levels of pFAK - Y397 ( Figure 7a ) , suggesting that an SLK - dependent pathway is required for Neu - stimulated focal adhesion turnover . Supporting the motility defects in NYPD - expressing cells , high levels of pFAK - Y397 were observed in GFP - control - infected cultures . However , no changes were observed after the expression of kinase - inactive SLK , suggesting that the levels of pFAK - Y397 in stable adhesions cannot be further increased . To quantitate the increase in adhesion stability imparted by dominant - negative SLK , we performed immunoﬂuorescence for HA - K D C and evaluated the surface area of vinculin - positive adhesions . In cells expressing the inactive Neu ( NYPD ) , large focal adhesions were observed , irrespective of SLK activity ( Figure 7b ) . However , in NeuNT - expressing cells ( YC and YD ) , vinculin - positive adhesions were much smaller . Expression of kinase - inactive SLK in these cells resulted in the appearance of larger focal adhesions ( about twice the size ; Figures 7b and c ) . Together , these data suggest that SLK is involved in Neu - dependent destabilization of focal adhesions required for efﬁcient cell migration . Discussion The processes of haptotaxis and chemotaxis require complex signaling events and cytoskeletal reorganiza - tion . We have recently shown that SLK is required for ﬁbronectin haptotaxis ( Wagner et al . , 2008 ) . Further - more , its activation by scratch wounding requires FAK . Figure 6 Activation of SLK through YC requires Shc . ( a ) NMuMG cells expressing the YC and YD constructs were transfected with pan - Shc siRNAs and surveyed for Shc expression using anti - ShcA antibodies . Efﬁcient knockdown was observed after 72h . ( b ) Shc - depleted cultures were stimulated with HRG b , and SLK kinase activity was assayed . No induction was observed in the YC - expressing cells in the absence of Shc . Figure 7 Dominant - negative SLK induces focal adhesion stabilization . ( a ) NMuMG cells expressing NeuNT or the NYPD mutant were infected with a dominant - negative SLK ( K D C ) adenovirus and surveyed for the levels of phosphoFAK - Y397 ( pY397 ) . Expression of kinase - inactive SLK results in increased pY397 FAK levels . ( b ) Immunostaining for vinculin , a focal adhesion marker , shows enlarged focal adhesions in K D C - expressing cells . ( c ) The area of the vinculin - positive sites was calculated in NMuMG cells expressing K D C or the GFP control . Adhesions were found to be enlarged by two - to four - fold . * P o 0 . 01 . ErbB2 - mediated cell migration requires SLK K Roovers et al 2845 Oncogene Here we provide evidence that SLK is also required for chemotaxis and invasion of breast cancer cells expressing oncogenic Neu . Our results show that SLK can be activated downstream of HRG b stimulation in 4T1 breast carcinomas and that the expression of dominant - negative SLK or siRNA - mediated knock - down results in impaired motility and invasion . As previously reported , we have shown that Neu - driven motility requires Tyr 1201 ( YC ) and 1227 ( YD ) ( Marone et al . , 2004 ) . Supporting this , SLK activation through Neu appears to require signaling from at least one of those residues . SLK activation through those tyrosines requires the SFKs , MEK1 , PI3K , Shc and PLC g signaling . Interestingly , activation by the Tyr 1201 requires PLC g and the Shc adapter , whereas PI3K activity is necessary for Tyr 1226 / 27 - dependent activa - tion . However , the MAPK pathway appears to be important for both YC and YD signaling . These pathways have also been shown to be required for Neu - mediated chemotaxis ( Marone et al . , 2004 ) . As SLK activity from either the YC or YD mutant appears to be similar to that of NeuNT , it is possible that these pathways converge on similar activation signals . Interestingly , TGF - b pretreatment of NMuMG cells expressing NeuNT induces the coupling of ShcA to YD and YE , but not to YC . In contrast , SLK activation by HRG b involves ShcA coupling to YC but not to YD . This may be speciﬁc to HRG - induced motility that requires YC - mediated Shc signaling in cooperation with YD signals such as PLC g . A signaling cross - talk between growth factor receptors and focal adhesion proteins has been previously shown ( Hauck et al . , 2000 ; Sieg et al . , 2000 ; Benlimame et al . , 2005 ) . In addition , we have previously reported that integrin - dependent FAK / Src / MEK signaling is required to activate SLK in a haptotactic model ( Wagner et al . , 2008 ) . Supporting this , SLK activity after HRG b treatment of FAK - null cells expressing NeuNT is markedly impaired . With regard to ﬁbronectin - stimu - lated haptotaxis , these results suggest that SLK activa - tion through activated Neu requires and must proceed through FAK signaling . It is then likely that haptotactic and chemotactic signals converge upon SLK activation . Recently , it has been shown that HRG stimulation of Neu / ErbB3 - overexpressing cells results in FAK phos - phorylation on Tyr 397 , but mainly on Tyr 861 and Tyr 925 in a Src - dependent manner ( Benlimame et al . , 2005 ) . Therefore , one possibility is that Neu activation at YC and YD sites is crucial for its coupling to FAK and subsequent SLK activation . As the activation of Neu leads to c - Src activation , coupling to the adhesion system may result in FAK autophosphorylation in addition to Src - dependent phosphorylation . The requirement for c - src may then be limited to Neu - mediated FAK activation , whereas the PI3K - , PLC g - and MAPK - dependent activation of SLK may result from signaling through FAK - Y397 and Y925 , respec - tively ( Mitra and Schlaepfer , 2006 ) . Focal adhesions are super - assemblies of proteins that form at sites of integrin adhesion to the extracellular matrix containing numerous cytoplasmic proteins , such as vinculin and paxillin . Cell motility is a dynamic process that requires the turnover of these structures . Growing evidence suggests that FAK autophosphorylation at Tyr 397 is important to signal turnover ( Hamadi et al . , 2005 ) by a src - dependent mechanism ( Frame , 2004 ) . Indeed , high levels of FAK - Y397 appear to correlate with stable adhesions and decreased motility ( Palazzo et al . , 2001 ; Palazzo and Gundersen , 2002 ) . Supporting this , NT - expressing cells display small adhesion and a low level of phospho - FAK - Y397 compared with the non - motile NYPD cultures . With regard to cultured ﬁbroblasts ( Wagner et al . , 2008 ) , expression of dominant - negative SLK in these cells results in increased phopsho - FAK - Y397 levels , enlarged adhesions and decreased cell migration . These observations suggest that SLK may act downstream of FAK - coupled chemotactic signals to control the turnover and stability of adhesions . Overall , our data show that Neu stimulation leads to SLK activation through the FAK complex . This activation requires Neu Tyr 1201 and Neu Tyr 1227 , previously implicated in motility . Our work , however , has not identiﬁed the FAK - dependent pathways that mediate SLK activation . Nevertheless , our data show that SLK may be an important therapeutic target down - stream of Neu / HER2 - driven migration and invasion .

FAK - null and SYF cells were supple - mented with 100 m M b - mercaptoethanol and 1m M sodium pyruvate . NMuMG cells were maintained in the above media with 20m M Hepes ( 4 - ( 2 - hydroxyethyl ) - 1 - piperazineethanesul - fonic acid ) buffer ( Q3 Sigma , Oakville , Ontario , Canada ) and 20 m g / ml insulin ( Sigma ) . All cell lines stably expressing Neu expression vectors were also maintained in 1 m g / ml puromycin . Cells were grown in a humidiﬁed 37 1 C incubator at 5 % CO 2 . For experiments , cells were grown to 60 % conﬂuence , serum - starved for up to 16h ( DMEM with 1 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) ) and then treated with 1n M HRG b 1 ( prepared with phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) þ 0 . 1 % BSA , Sigma ) . Plasmids and transient transfections Neu cDNA and point mutants inserted in pMSCV - puro vector ( Invitrogen ) were kindly provided by Dr William Muller ( Q4 McGill , Montreal , Quebec , Canada ) . Transient transfections in HeLa cells were performed with 3 m g of plasmid DNA per 60 mm plate of cells using Lipofectamine / Plus transfection reagents ( Gibco ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . For stable expression in FAK (cid:2) / (cid:2) FAK þ , SYF and SYF þ src cells , the transfections were as described above and then selected with 2 m g / ml puromycin . siRNA knockdown and adenovirus infections Cells plated at a density of 2 (cid:3) 10 5 in 60mm plates were transfected with 10 p M SLK siRNA ( Q5 Dharmacon , Lafayette , ErbB2 - mediated cell migration requires SLK K Roovers et al 2846 Oncogene CO , USA ) duplex ( 5 0 - GGUUGAGAUUGACAUAUUA - 3 0 Q6 ) using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent ( Invitrogen ) . Dharmacon’s non - targeting duplex was used as a control siRNA . The Shc siRNA knockdowns were performed as described ( Northey et al . , 2008 ) . For some experiments , cells were infected at an MOI ( multiplicity of infection ) of 50 with an adenoviral vector expressing an SLK short hairpin ( psiSTRIKE ; Fisher , Ottawa , Ontario , Canada ) that consisted in the same SLK siRNA sequence . The control was a scrambled sequence . On the basis of western analysis , SLK and Shc expressions were suppressed most efﬁciently 48 and 72h post - transfection , respectively . Therefore , cells were used in the assays at those time points . Adenoviral vectors expressing kinase - inactive SLK ( HA - K D C : residues 1 – 373 with an ATP - binding site mutation ; K63R ) or a GFP control were used to infect cultures . Cells were infected at a MOI of 10 by the addition of adenovirus directly to the cells in 0 . 25 % fetal bovine serum - DMEM 18 h before cell migration or kinase assays . Expression of the SLK or GFP constructs was conﬁrmed by immunoblotting . Transwell migration and invasion assays For migration assays , cells ( 2 (cid:3) 10 4 ) were resuspended in DMEM containing 0 . 5 % BSA and added to the top of a Transwell ( Fisher , Ottawa , Ontario , Canada ) migration chamber ( 24 - well , 8 m m pore ) pre - coated with collagen I ( 100 m g / ml ) and allowed to migrate for 24h in the presence of 1n M HRG b in the bottom chamber . Residual cells were removed from the top of the membrane and the cells on underside of the membrane were washed in PBS , ﬁxed in 4 % paraformaldehyde and stained with DAPI ( 4 , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ; 0 . 5 m g / ml , Sigma ) . The cells that migrated were counted from ﬁve random ﬁelds ( (cid:3) 10 ) using DAPI ﬂuorescence and photographed using a Q9 Sony ( Toronto , Canada ) HB050 or Zeiss Axiocam digital camera and analysed by using Northern Eclipse software or AxioVision software , respectively . Three chambers for each condition were counted . Experiments were repeated three times . Representative experiments are shown . Invasion assays were performed similar to the above - described migration assays except cells were plated on Matrigel - coated invasion chambers ( Q11 BD Bioscience ) and cells were allowed to invade / migrate for 48h . Western blotting , immunoprecipitation and kinase assays Cells were washed with cold PBS , collected by scraping into PBS and recovered by centrifugation at 5000 g for 2 min . Cell pellets were lysed in RIPA buffer with inhibitors ( 25 ) and lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 10 000 g for 2min . Protein concentrations were determined using protein assay dye reagent ( Q12 Bio - Rad , Mississauga , Ontario , Canada ) . Equal amounts of protein ( 20 – 40 m g ) were electrophoresed on 8 % polyacrylamide gels and transferred to PVDF ( polyvinylidene diﬂuoride ) membrane . The membranes were probed with the indicated primary antibodies overnight at 4 1 C in 5 % BSA or skim milk powder in 1 (cid:3) TBST ( 50m M Tris pH 7 . 4 , 150m M NaCl , 0 . 05 Tween 20 ) . Target proteins were detected with horseradish peroxidase - coupled secondary antibodies com - bined with chemiluminescence ( Q13 Perkin - Elmer , Waltham , MA , USA ) and exposure to X - ray ﬁlm . The following antibodies were used : anti - SLK ( 25 ) , anti - Neu ( Q14 EMD - Calbiochem , Gibbstown , NJ , USA ) , anti - FAK ( Q15 Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA , USA ) , anti - pTyr397 - FAK ( Q16 BD Biosciences , Mississauga , Ontario , Canada ) , anti - src ( Santa Cruz Biotech - nology ) , anti - actin ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , anti - HA ( 12CA5 mouse ascites ) and anti - GFP ( Q17 Clontech , Mountain - view , CA , USA ) . For immunoprecipitations , 300 – 400 m g of protein lysate was immunoprecipitated with 3 m g of anti - SLK and 30 – 40 m l of protein A sepharose ( Q18 GE Health Care , Piscataway , NJ , USA ) for 2h . Immune complexes were recovered by centrifugation and washed with the NETN buffer ( 20m M Tris - HCl pH 8 . 0 , 1 m M EDTA , 150 m M NaCl , 0 . 5 % Nonidet P - 40 ) and subjected to kinase assay . In vitro SLK kinase assays were performed after SLK immunoprecipitation as described previously ( 25 ) . Kinase reactions were stopped by the addition of 7 m l of 4 (cid:3) SDS sample buffer and electrophoresed on 8 % SDS – PAGE . The gels were transferred to PVDF membranes and subjected to autoradiography followed by western blotting with anti - SLK antibody . Inhibitor studies Serum - starved NMuMG cell lines were pre - incubated for 60min with 10 m M of U0126 ( Q19 Cell Signaling Technologies , Pickering , Ontario , Canada ) , 20 m M SB203580 , 25 m M LY294002 , 2 m M U - 73122 , 10 m M PP2 , 10 m M PP3 ( EMD - Calbiochem ) or DMSO , or EtOH control and then treated with 1n M HRG for 2h . Immunoﬂuorescence Cells were plated onto coverslips . After experiments , cells were washed with PBS , ﬁxed in 4 % paraformaldehyde , permeabilized with Triton X - 100 and blocked in 5 % goat serum / PBS for 20min . Fresh blocking solution containing primary antibodies ( anti - vinculin ; 1 : 100 , VIN - 11 - 5 , Sigma ) was added and incubated for 1h at room temperature . Primary antibodies were detected with anti - mouse AF594 Q20 secondary ( 1 : 1000 , Alexa Fluor , Invitrogen ) . The samples were visualized with a Zeiss Axioscope100 epiﬂuorescence microscope ( Ziess ) equipped with the appropriate ﬁlters . Digital images of (cid:3) 100 ﬁelds were captured with a Zeiss Axiocam digital camera and AxioVision software using identical acquisition parameters . Images were saved as JPEG ﬁles , and immunoﬂuor - escent areas and gray values were quantiﬁed using ImageJ ( NIH software ) . One distinct lamellipodium was chosen on a cell , and focal adhesions ( 6 – 10 ) were identiﬁed and measured . Twelve cells ( four from three independent experiments ) for each condition were used for this evaluation .
