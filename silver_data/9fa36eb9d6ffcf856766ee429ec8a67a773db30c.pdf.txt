WAVE2 is Regulated by Multiple Phosphorylation Events Within its VCA Domain Shirin M . Pocha and Giles O . Cory * Department of Biochemistry , Faculty of Medical and Veterinary Sciences , University of Bristol , Bristol , United Kingdom The ( Wiskott - Aldrich Syndrome Protein ) - family verprolin homologous protein ( WAVE ) family of proteins occupies a pivotal position in the cell , converting extracellular signals into the formation of branched ﬁlamentous ( F ) actin struc - tures . WAVE proteins contain a verprolin central acidic ( VCA ) domain at their C - terminus , responsible for binding to and activating the Arp2 / 3 complex , which in - turn nucleates the formation of new actin ﬁlaments . Here we identify ﬁve Casein Kinase 2 ( CK2 ) phosphorylation sites within the VCA domain of WAVE2 , serines 482 , 484 , 488 , 489 , and 497 . Phosphorylation of these sites is required for a high afﬁnity interaction with the Arp2 / 3 complex . Phosphorylation of ser 482 and 484 speciﬁcally inhibits the activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex by the WAVE2 VCA domain , but has no effect on the afﬁnity for the Arp2 / 3 complex when the other phosphorylation sites are occupied . We demonstrate phosphorylation of all ﬁve sites on endogenous WAVE2 and show that their mutation to non - phosphory - latable alanine residues inhibits WAVE2 function in vivo , inhibiting cell rufﬂing and disrupting the integrity of the leading edge of migrating cells .

Key words : actin ; Arp2 / 3 complex ; CK2 ; cytoskeleton ; rufﬂes INTRODUCTION The regulated polymerization of actin monomers into ﬁlaments underlies several cellular processes includ - ing the protrusion of cell membranes , endocytosis and the establishment of polarity [ Ridley , 2006 ] . The forma - tion of new actin ﬁlaments is energetically unfavourable under cellular conditions . This enables the tight regula - tion of actin dynamics via a number of catalytic factors which allow for the spatial and temporal control of F - actin production [ Pollard , 2007 ] . The ﬁrst of these fac - tors identiﬁed was the Arp2 / 3 complex , which stimulates the formation of branched actin structures seen in the leading edge lamellipodia of migrating cells [ Machesky et al . , 1999 ] . The Arp2 / 3 complex is a complex of seven pro - teins and can itself be activated by interaction with pro - teins containing verprolin central acidic ( VCA ) domains . VCA domains bind both globular actin and the Arp2 / 3 complex and are thought to stimulate a conformational change in the quaternary structure of the Arp2 / 3 complex [ Robinson et al . , 2001 ; Goley et al . , 2004 ; Rodal et al . , 2005 ] . In this state the Arp2 / 3 complex could potentially mimic an actin dimer , overcoming the initial barrier to * Correspondence to : Giles O .

Wiskott - Aldrich Syndrome Protein / WASP family verprolin homologous protein ( WASP / WAVE ) proteins are characterized by a C - terminal VCA domain , preceded by numerous protein domains postulated to regulate its activity or subcellular localization [ Ibarra et al . , 2005 ] . Thus , WASP / WAVE proteins act as nodes through which extracellular signals are converted into the co - ordinated formation of F - actin structures . There are three mammalian WAVE isoforms . WAVE2 is essential for life and mediates the formation of lamellipodia downstream of Rac in murine embryonic ﬁbroblasts ( MEFs ) [ Yan et al . , 2003 ] , as well as regulat - ing the polarization of the Golgi apparatus downstream of MAP kinases [ Magdalena et al . , 2003 ; Danson et al . , 2007 ] . The mechanism of WAVE regulation is still not settled , with several models proposed , including regula - tion through its interaction with a protein complex con - taining Nap1 , Pir , Abi and HSC300 and / or through bind - ing IRSp53 [ Ibarra et al . , 2005 ] . It is becoming clear that phosphorylation of WAVE proteins is crucial for their biochemical and cellular function , with both serine and tyrosine phosphorylation playing important roles [ Leng et al . , 2005 ; Ardern et al . , 2006 ; Kim et al . , 2006 ; Dan - son et al . , 2007 ] . We have shown that the activity of WASP is dependent upon phosphorylation of its VCA domain by casein kinase ( CK2 ) [ Cory et al . , 2003 ] , and others have shown WAVE2 VCA domain phosphoryla - tion by Erk at two sites [ Nakanishi et al . , 2007 ] . We sought to characterise WAVE2 VCA domain phospho - rylation more fully and report here the identiﬁcation of ﬁve phosphorylation sites in the WAVE2 - VCA domain . We found that the previously reported sites were not tar - gets for Erk , but instead that these and three novel sites are CK2 targets . We characterise the varying effects of phosphorylation on the VCA domain’s afﬁnity for and ability to activate the Arp2 / 3 complex . By introducing phospho - deﬁcient mutants into NIH - 3T3 cells , we show that phosphorylation of the WAVE2 - VCA domain has profound effects on its cellular properties . MATERIALS AND METHODS Reagents and Cells NIH - 3T3 ﬁbroblasts were grown in DMEM ( Invi - trogen ) supplemented with 10 % newborn calf serum ( Invitrogen ) and pen / strep . Cos - 7 cells were grown with 10 % foetal calf serum . Antibodies anti - WAVE2 ( D16 ) , anti - GST and secondary HRP linked secondary antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotech . Inc . Anti - p34Arc was obtained from Upstate Biotech . Inc . Anti - FLAG ( M2 ) was obtained from Sigma . Alexa 568 labelled phalloidin was obtained from Invitrogen . Phospho - speciﬁc antibodies were raised against the phospho - peptides shown in Fig . 2 . Peptides correspond - ing to pser482 / 4 and pser488 / 9 were terminated with an amide . Peptides were conjugated to KLH and used to immunize rabbits ( Eurogentec Ltd . ) . Serum from the ﬁnal bleed was clariﬁed by centrifugation at 25 , 000 g for 30 min , and the supernatant was supplemented with 1 3 TTBS ( 0 . 5 M NaCl , 20 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 1 % Tween - 20 ) and 1 % phosphatase inhibitor cocktail 1 ( Sigma p - 2850 ) . This was negatively puriﬁed against the non - phospho peptide coupled to epoxy sepharose 6B ( ES6B ) ( GE Healthcare ) . Flow through was passed over an ES6B phospho - peptide afﬁnity column three times and washed with TTBS until the ﬂow through had an OD280 nm < 0 . 01 . Antibody was then eluted with 0 . 2 M glycine ( pH 2 . 8 ) and neutralized with Tris - HCl ( pH 8 . 0 ) . Expression Constructs WAVE2 - VCA domain ( residues 420 – 498 ) was ampliﬁed from human cDNA by PCR and cloned into ei - ther pEF - Bos downstream of GST or pCMV5 ( accession AF239249 ) downstream of a FLAG epitope . Point muta - tions were introduced using the Stratagene Quikchange method , and sequenced . Lentiviral vectors were generated by transfer of EGFP - WAVE2 cDNA into a pSEW sin vector backbone [ Danson et al . , 2007 ] . Virus was produced by co - trans - fection of 293T cells with this plasmid , and pCMV D R8 . 91 ( packaging plasmid ) and pMD . G2 ( VSV - G pseudotyping plasmid ) , and recovering cell supernatant after 48 h . Recombinant Protein Production Cos - 7 cells ( 5 3 10 6 ) were electroporated with 10 l g of plasmid in electroporation buffer : ( 120 mM KCl , 10 mM K2PO4 / KH2PO4 , pH 7 . 6 , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 25 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 6 , 0 . 5 % Ficoll 400 ) using a Bio - Rad Gene - pulser at 250 V , 960 l F . After growth overnight COS - 7 cells were lysed on ice with lysis buffer : IGEPAL - 630 ( 1 % ) , 130 mM NaCl , 20 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 , 10 mM NaF , 2 mM sodium orthovanadate , 1 % aprotinin , 10 l g / ml leupeptin , 1 mM phenylmethyl - sulfonyl ﬂuoride , 1 mM EDTA . Lysates were clariﬁcatied by centrifugation and incubated with 50 l l glutathione - Sepharose 4B beads at 4 8 C for 2 h . Beads were washed three times with LB , twice with 0 . 8 M LiCl , 20 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 , and once with 10 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 Phospho - Regulation of the WAVE2 VCA Domain 37 Immunoprecipitation Endogenous WAVE2 was immunoprecipitated from 3 3 10 6 NIH - 3T3 cells lysed as above . 5 l l Santa - Cruz anti - WAVE2 antibody was incubated per sample for 2 h at 4 8 C , followed by immobilization with 20 l l Protein A / G sepharose mix , Santa Cruz for a further 2 h . Beads were washed as above . Metabolic Labelling Cos - 7 cells were electroporated with GST - VCA or FLAG - VCA domain constructs as described above . After growth ovenight , cells were incubated in growth medium containing 10 Mbq orthophosphate ( GE Healthcare ) for 3 h , washed and lysed before afﬁnity puriﬁcation . Phosphatase / Kinase Reactions GST pull - downs or WAVE2 immunoprecipitates were washed in lysis buffer and 0 . 8M LiCl , 20mM Tris pH 8 . 0 prior to incubation with 40 U calf intestinal phos - phatase ( New England Biolabs ) for 30 min at 37 8 C in the manufacturer’s buffer . Following further washing , precipitates were resuspended with 10 U CK2 ( New England Biolabs ) ( in 50 mM Tris pH 7 . 4 , 50 mM NaCl , 10 mM MgCl 2 , 12 l M ATP ) or 100 ng recombinant Jnk2 or Erk2 ( Upstate Biotech . Inc . ) according to manu - facturer’s instructions , for 45 min at 37 8 C . These steps were performed prior to elution of the protein where required ( see below ) . Afﬁnity Puriﬁcation Equal quantities of GST - WAVE2 - VCA proteins attached to glutathione sepharose 4B ( GS4B ) beads were washed thoroughly ( 0 . 8 M LiCl ) to remove interacting proteins and incubated with fresh lysate from Cos - 7 or U937 cells at the indicated concentration , for 2 h prior to washing 3 3 with lysis buffer . Actin Polymerization Assays GST - WAVE2 - VCA domain was over - expressed in Cos - 7 cells and puriﬁed with glutathione sepharose beads . Where indicated WAVE2 was treated with calf intestinal phosphatase ( CIP ) then CK2 as described prior to elution three times for 30 min at RT with 200 l l of : 20 mM reduced glutathione , 130 mM NaCl , 50 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 . Eluates were pooled and dialysed against 10 mM Tris pH 8 , 1 mM EDTA . Protein concentration was esti - mated using Bradford reagent with BSA as a standard . Arp2 / 3 complex , actin and pyrene actin were from Cytoskeleton Inc . Polymerization assays were performed in 75 mM KCl , 1mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 10 mM im - idazole , pH 7 . 0 with 10 nM Arp2 / 3 complex and 2 . 5 l M actin ( 0 . 125 l M ) pyrene actin ) , pre exchanged with 200 l M ATP . Fluorescence was measured using excita - tion of 365 nm and emission at 405 nm . Rufﬂing NIH - 3T3 cells were infected with lentivirus con - taining cDNA for EGFP - WAVE2 with a multiplicity of infection of one , as calculated using titrations of NIH - 3T3 cells . After 48 h cells were washed and grown on for 1 week prior to freezing . Aliquots were thawed and grown further prior to seeding onto coverslips ( coated with poly - L - lysine followed by ﬁbronectin 12 . 5 l g / ml ) in medium containing 0 . 5 % serum at (cid:1) 60 % conﬂuence . After 24 h cells were stimulated with platelet - derived growth factor ( PDGF ) bb ( Upstate Biotechnology Inc . ) at 1 ng / ml for 25 min then ﬁxed and stained with phalloi - din . Cells with one or more F - actin rich rufﬂe were scored . Data were obtained from three separate experi - ments each counting 5 or 10 ﬁelds per condition . Scratch - Wounding Lentivirally infected cells ( see above ) were seeded into 4 - well glass chambers as described [ Danson et al . , 2007 ] . Wounds were generated using a (cid:1) 0 . 5 mm point , and cells tracked as described [ Danson et al . , 2007 ] . Leading edges were analyzed after 7 . 5 h . Movie stills were taken and the ratio between the wound perim - eter and the straight line distance calculated to give an indication of raggedness . Data were gathered from three separate experiments with 20 wound edge ﬁelds per con - dition analyzed in total . Statistics Data were analyzed using Graphpad Prism soft - ware and Fisher’s exact test ( rufﬂing ) , and ANOVA ( per - sistence and raggedness ) as detailed in the ﬁgure legends . RESULTS Phosphorylation of the WASP - VCA domain by CK2 has marked effects on its Arp2 / 3 complex binding and activation properties [ Cory et al . , 2003 ] . We noted that the WAVE2 - VCA domain also contains several potential CK2 sites ( Fig . 1A ) and were interested to know if phosphorylation of this region inﬂuenced its actin nucleation activity . The WAVE2 - VCA Domain Is Phosphorylated on Five Residues We noted that the GST - tagged WAVE2 - VCA domain puriﬁed from Cos - 7 cells migrated faster on SDS - PAGE following treatment with CIP ( Fig . 1B ) , indicating the presence of one or more phosphates . Three residues within the WAVE2 - VCA domain fall within the 38 Pocha and Cory strictest CK2 consensus sequence of ser / thr - X - X - asp / glu [ Kuenzel et al . , 1987 ; Meggio and Pinna , 2003 ] , namely ser482 , ser484 , and ser489 , making them candidates for phosphorylation . Individual mutations of these residues to a non - phosphorylatable alanine did not noticeably alter the mobility of the VCA domain on SDS - PAGE . However , dual mutation of ser482 and ser489 markedly increased the mobility of the VCA domain ( Fig . 1B ) . As the mobility was not increased further by CIP treatment , it appears that phosphorylation of ser482 and ser489 is responsible for the mobility shift . However , as not all phosphorylation events alter protein mobility , we also looked at the incorporation of radiolabelled phosphate into the WAVE2 - VCA domain using metabolic label - ling . While mutation of ser484 to alanine had no effect on mobility of the WAVE2 - VCA domain , it did reduce incorporation of 32 P when mutated in addition to the dual ser482 / 489 ala mutation ( Fig . 1C ) , suggesting it is also a phosphorylation site . Additional mutation of the remaining serine residues within the WAVE2 - VCA do - main—ser488 ( 4A mutant ) and ser497 ( 5A mutant ) — also cumulatively reduced incorporation of phosphate ( Fig . 1D ) , indicating that all ﬁve serine residues within the acidic region of the WAVE2 - VCA domain are poten - tial phosphorylation sites . Endogenous WAVE2 Is Phosphorylated Within the VCA Domain To determine whether the ﬁve serine residues iden - tiﬁed above were true phosphorylation targets , we raised antibodies against the appropriate phospho - peptide sequences ( Fig . 2A ) . Due to their close proximity , dou - bly phosphorylated peptides were used to generate anti - bodies against p482 / p484 and p488 / p489 . All antibodies recognized wild type GST - WAVE2 - VCA domain fusion proteins puriﬁed from Cos - 7 cells , but had no reactivity against phosphatased forms or GST ( Fig . 2B ) . Mutation of target residues also prevented reactivity , demonstrat - ing that the antibodies are both phospho - and site speciﬁc . As expected , the p488 / p489 antibody had full reactivity with the dual WAVE2 - VCA ser482 / ser484ala mutant , but it still retained some reactivity following fur - ther mutation of ser489ala in a triple mutant ( Fig . 2B , lane 3A ) . This was lost following further mutation of ser488 ala , demonstrating an absolute requirement for phosphorylation of ser488 and a partial requirement for phosphorylation of ser489 for reactivity . WAVE2 immunoprecipitates from NIH - 3T3 cells were detected by all antibodies ( Fig . 2C ) , showing that WAVE2 is phosphorylated on these sites in vivo ( with the caveat regarding ser489 discussed above ) . CK2 and Not MAP Kinases Phosphorylate the WAVE2 VCA Domain A recent report claimed that WAVE2 ser482 and ser484 are targets for Erk2 in vitro [ Nakanishi et al . , 2007 ] . We thought this unlikely ( 1 ) due to the lack of an Erk consensus sequence S / T - P and ( 2 ) due to the homol - ogy of these residues with the CK2 sites in the WASP - VCA domain [ Cory et al . , 2003 ] , a fact overlooked by the authors . We found that dephosphorylated WAVE2 immunoprecipitates could be restored to endogenous lev - els of phosphorylation by CK2 treatment ( Fig . 2C ) . Next , we puriﬁed GST - WAVE2 - VCA domain from Cos - 7 cells and treated it with CIP . In vitro kinase assays were performed with CK2 , Erk2 or Jnk2 and samples were immunoblotted with phospho - speciﬁc antibodies . CK2 treatment led to phosphorylation at all ﬁve sites , whereas Erk or Jnk treatment did not phosphorylate any ( Fig . 2D ) . Erk and Jnk were shown to be functional by parallel assays demonstrating their ability to phosphoryl - ate sites in the poly - proline rich region of a GST - WAVE2 fusion protein [ Danson et al . , 2007 ] ( Fig . 2E ) . WAVE2 Is Constitutively Phosphorylated In Vivo We have used our phospho - speciﬁc antibodies to monitor levels of phosphorylation of endogenous WAVE2 . We ﬁnd that WAVE2 is constitutively phos - phorylated in the VCA domain in all conditions Fig . 1 . The WAVE2 VCA domain is phosphorylated on multiple serines .

D : FLAG tagged WAVE2 VCA domains were metabolically labelled in Cos - 7 cells and analyzed as indicated . 3A 5 482A 1 484A 1 489A ; 4A 5 3A 1 488A ; 5A 5 4A 1 497A . Phospho - Regulation of the WAVE2 VCA Domain 39 tested , including serum starvation / stimulation , growth factor stimulation and scratch wounding among others ( data not shown ) . WAVE2 isolated from NIH - 3T3 cells cannot be further phosphorylated on the VCA domain by CK2 treatment ( Fig . 2C ) suggesting that a large proportion of cellular WAVE2 is phosphorylated in the VCA domain , similar to WASP [ Cory et al . , 2003 ] , indicating the constitutively active nature of CK2 . However , in contrast to WASP we are unable to inhibit this phosphorylation using CK2 inhibitors , de - spite a reduction of N - WASP phosphorylation at its CK2 dependent VCA domain phosphorylation site ( Fig . 3B ) . A panel of other kinase inhibitors ( including PI3 kinase and MAP kinase inhibitors ) have been tested under a variety of conditions and have also failed to reduce WAVE2 - VCA domain phosphorylation ( Fig . 3 and data not shown ) . The rea - son for this resistance to CK2 inhibitors is unclear but it may reﬂect the existence of an inaccessible pool of CK2 , a very long - lived and stable phospho - protein species or the involvement of a distinct kinase , resist - ant to the inhibitors tested . It is also possible that there are spatial , temporal or signal dependent changes in WAVE2 VCA domain phosphorylation that we are unable to detect using our methodology . Multiple Phosphorylation Increases the Afﬁnity of the VCA Domain for the Arp2 / 3 Complex VCA domain binding to the Arp2 / 3 complex occurs through residues within the central ( C ) and acidic ( A ) regions of the VCA domain [ Marchand et al . , 2001 ; Panchal et al . , 2003 ] . Wild type WAVE2 - VCA domain puriﬁed from Cos - 7 cells was highly phosphorylated within the VCA domain ( see Fig . 2 ) and bound the Arp2 / 3 complex from fresh cell lysates ( Fig . 4A ) . Phosphatase treatment of the WAVE2 - VCA drastically reduced the amount of Arp2 / 3 complex bound . The role of phospho - rylation was conﬁrmed by the ﬁnding that binding could be restored by CK2 treatment ( Figs . 4A and 4B ) . We found in contrast to the ﬁndings of Nakanishi et al . that Fig . 2 . The WAVE2 VCA domain is phosphorylated by CK2 . A : phospho - peptides used to generate antibodies . pS indicates phospho - serine . B : GST - WAVE2 VCA domains were puriﬁed from Cos - 7 cells and treated with CIP where indicated . Numeric lane descriptors ( left panel ) indicate residues mutated to alanine , or additive mutants ( nA ) as described in legend to Fig . 1 . Antibodies used for immuno - blotting are indicated on the right of relevant panel . C : Endogenous WAVE2 was immuno - precipitated from NIH - 3T3 cells and treated with CIP / CK2 as indicated , before immuno - blotting . D : WAVE2 VCA domains were puriﬁed from Cos - 7 cells and treated with CIP / kinase as indi - cated before immuno - blotting . E : Fusion proteins were puriﬁed from Cos - 7 cells and treated with CIP / kinase as a control for kinase activity . 40 Pocha and Cory WAVE2 - VCA domains bearing a double alanine muta - tion at sites 482 and 484 showed no reduction in afﬁnity for the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Figs . 4A and 4B ) . Instead , cu - mulative mutation of the phosphorylation sites within the VCA domain lead to a decrease in the afﬁnity for the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Fig . 4A ) . We could not attribute this decrease in binding to phosphorylation of any speciﬁc residues as independent alanine substitutions at 482 1 4 , 488 1 9 , and 497 all bound the Arp2 / 3 complex with similar afﬁnity over a range of concentrations ( Fig . 4B ) . Binding to G - actin is independent of the phosphorylation state of the VCA domain ( Fig . 4A ) . This would be expected as the G - actin binding V region lies N - terminal to the CK2 phosphorylation sites [ Kelly et al . , 2006 ] . Phosphorylation Inhibits the Activity of the WAVE2 - VCA Domain The effect of phosphorylation on the activity of the WAVE2 - VCA domain was tested using in vitro poly - merization assays . Wild type ( phosphorylated ) GST - WAVE2 - VCA domains isolated from Cos - 7 cells were inactive in these assays , and were unable to stimulate the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Figs . 4C and 4D ) . Higher concentra - tions ( > 100 nM ) of WT - WAVE2 VCA were unable to stimulate the Arp2 / 3 complex ( data not shown ) . How - ever , dephosphorylation resulted in an active VCA do - main , capable of stimulating the Arp2 / 3 complex to nu - cleate branched actin structures , suggesting an inhibitory role for phosphorylation ( Fig . 4C ) . Use of VCA domain point mutants , revealed that prevention of phosphoryla - tion of ser482 and ser484 , but not the other sites , leads to activity akin to the dephosphorylated protein , suggesting that ser482 and ser484 phosphorylation by CK2 is inhibi - tory . Mutation of ser488 and ser489 together or ser497 alone resulted in an inactive VCA domain ( ie compara - ble to the activity of wild - type VCA domain ) , showing that their phosphorylation is not inhibitory . Treatment of dephosphorylated wild type VCA domain protein with CK2 caused reversion of the VCA domain to an inactive form , whereas treatment of the ser482 / 484 ala mutant with CK2 does not suppress its activity ( Fig . 4D ) , con - ﬁrming that inhibition by CK2 is speciﬁc to phosphoryla - tion of these residues . A ser482 / 484 / 488 / 489 ala quadru - ple mutant in which only ser497 is phosphorylated showed no increase in activity over the 5A mutant ( ie . in the absence of inhibitory ser482 / 484 phosphorylation , data not shown ) . This shows that the increase in afﬁnity for the Arp2 / 3 complex in the 4A mutant compared to the 5A ( Fig 4A ) does not enhance the ability of the VCA domain to stimulate Arp2 / 3 complex function , in line with the studies divorcing the afﬁnity from the efﬁcacy of Arp2 / 3 complex activation [ Panchal et al . , 2003 ] . Phosphorylation and Cellular Function of WAVE2 We were interested to know whether VCA domain phosphorylation was required for the cellular function of WAVE2 . PDGF stimulation of ﬁbroblasts results in the formation of both peripheral and dorsal ( circular ) rufﬂes , a process thought to rely on WAVEs [ Suetsugu et al . , 2003 ; Yan et al . , 2003 ] . Imaging of the actin cytoskele - ton with ﬂuorescently labelled phalloidin revealed a pre - dominance of circular rufﬂes that form on the dorsal sur - face of the cells upon PDGF stimulation . There were also some cells that exhibited small peripheral rufﬂes . We found that low - level expression of a dominant nega - tive GFP - WAVE2 construct lacking its VCA domain signiﬁcantly inhibited rufﬂe formation in response to PDGF ( Fig . 5 ) whereas wild type GFP - WAVE2 or a green ﬂuorescent protein ( GFP ) control did not . Intro - duction of GFP - WAVE2 5A also inhibited rufﬂe forma - tion ( Figs . 5A – 5C ) , indicating that phosphorylation of the VCA domain is required for its cellular function , and that in its absence , WAVE2 expression exerts apparently dominant negative effects . We next looked at the effects Fig . 3 . Effect of inhibitors on endogenous WAVE2 . NIH - 3T3 ﬁbro - blasts were starved by plating in 0 . 5 % calf serum and incubating over - night . The indicated inhibitors were added to the culture medium for 3 h prior to stimulation with 10 % serum for 7 min where indicated . A : Cells were lysed and WAVE2 immunoprecipitated . Samples were split in three and immunoblotted with phospho - speciﬁc antibodies . Blots were stripped and reprobed for WAVE2 showing equal loading ( the pp488 / 9 blot reprobe is shown here . The others showed similar loading but are omitted for clarity ) . Lysates were probed with phos - pho - Erk antibodies ( pERK ) , stripped and reprobed with antibodies for total Erk ( tot . ERK ) . B : As A except lysates were blotted for SK896 , a phospho - speciﬁc antibody recognizing CK2 dependent phosphoryla - tion of N - WASP [ Cory et al . , 2003 ] . Tubulin blots were used as a loading control .

Phospho - Regulation of the WAVE2 VCA Domain 41 of cumulatively mutating the VCA domain phosphoryla - tion sites on the effect of WAVE2 transgene expression on rufﬂe formation . A dual mutation of ser482 / 4 ala ( 2A ) , had no signiﬁcant effect on rufﬂe formation , whereas the 4A and 5A mutants did show signiﬁcant in - hibition of rufﬂe formation in response to PDGF ( Figs . 5D and 5E ) . These ﬁndings suggest that the phospho - de - pendence of the afﬁnity of the WAVE2 VCA domain for the Arp2 / 3 complex may be important for WAVE2 func - tion in vivo . These data extend the ﬁndings of Nakanishi et al , who show that a 2A mutant was adept at restoring rufﬂe formation in WAVE2 null ﬁbroblasts [ Nakanishi et al . , 2007 ] . We ﬁnd that WAVE1 is upregulated in NIH - 3T3 cells following WAVE2 siRNAi treatment ( data not shown ) , making attempts to study the ability of the transgene to rescue cells with knocked - down WAVE2 levels difﬁcult to interpret . In order to induce the formation of peripheral cell protrusions ( or lamellae ) we performed scratch - wound - ing assays on conﬂuent monolayers of NIH - 3T3 cells which respond by extending lamellae into the wound space , followed by migration towards the opposing wound edge . We observed that the wound edge was con - siderably more ragged in appearance following expres - sion of either delta VCA or 5A WAVE2 ( Figs . 6A and 6C ) . This was quantiﬁed by dividing the straight - line distance between the edges of a wound by the total perimeter distance or ‘coastline’ of the wound edge ( Fig . Fig . 4 .

This analysis revealed a signiﬁcant increase in rag - gedness caused by WAVE2 5A expression ( Fig . 6D ) suggesting that the integrity of the leading edge had been compromised and that formation of lamellipodia had been disrupted . Knock - down of WAVE2 has been shown to decrease the persistence of migration direction [ Danson et al . , 2007 ] , providing another means to test the importance of VCA domain phosphorylation . We observed that low level expression of GFP - WAVE2 5A caused a slight but signiﬁcant reduction in the persist - ence of migration ( Fig . 7A ) , with wound edge cells dis - playing frequent changes in direction compared to GFP - WAVE2 - WT expressing cells or GFP controls ( Fig . 7B ) . Overall migration speed was not affected ( Fig . 7C ) . These data are consistent with the PDGF rufﬂing experi - ments and demonstrate a requirement for phosphoryla - tion of WAVE2 for it to contribute to cell protrusion . DISCUSSION In this paper we show that WAVE2 is subject to multiple functional phosphorylation events within its VCA domain . As the VCA domain is the key output Fig . 6 .

Two other reports of VCA domain phosphorylation have been published . A recent paper identiﬁed ser482 and ser484 as in vitro targets for Erk2 , despite the ab - sence of a proline in the 1 1 position [ Nakanishi et al . , 2007 ] , generally regarded as the minimal consensus sequence for this kinase [ Shaul and Seger , 2007 ] . Our use of gel shift analysis and phospho - speciﬁc antibodies demonstrates a high stoicheometry of phosphorylation by CK2 , whereas Nakanishi et al . rely on incorporation of radiolabelled phosphate , which while demonstrating phosphorylation of the VCA domain gives no indication of the stoicheometry . We were unable to show any phosphorylation of the WAVE2 VCA domain using Fig . 7 . Decrease in migration persistence in cells expressing VCA - phospho - deﬁcient WAVE2 .

Phospho - Regulation of the WAVE2 VCA Domain 45 recombinant Erk2 , and suggest that the results of Naka - nishi et al may reﬂect a contaminant in their Erk2 prepa - ration or extended incubation times . In addition , the phosphorylated residues we have identiﬁed comply largely with established CK2 consensus sequences [ Kuenzel et al . , 1987 ; Meggio and Pinna , 2003 ] , and complement an earlier study of phosphorylation of the WASP VCA domain by CK2 [ Cory et al . , 2003 ] . In addition to ser482 and ser484 we have used phospho - speciﬁc antibodies to identify ser487 , ser488 , and ser497 as true in vivo phosphorylation sites in WAVE2 . Our results suggest that multiple phosphoryla - tion of the WAVE2 - VCA domain is required for high afﬁnity binding to the Arp2 / 3 complex . Abolition of ser482 and ser484 phosphorylation , did not affect the afﬁnity of the interaction when the other phosphorylation sites were occupied , despite the inhibitory effect of phos - phorylation of ser482 and 484 on the activity of the VCA domain . The lack of correlation between the afﬁn - ity of a VCA domain for the Arp2 / 3 complex and its ac - tivity has long been established , suggesting the presence of a two step mechanism [ Marchand et al . , 2001 ; Panchal et al . , 2003 ; Beltzner and Pollard , 2008 ] . Our data on the afﬁnity of the VCA domain for the Arp2 / 3 complex cor - relate with work showing that regions of the WAVE1 VCA domain equivalent to ser488 and ser497 form con - tacts with the Arp2 / 3 complex whereas ser482 and ser484 do not [ Panchal et al . , 2003 ; Kelly et al . , 2006 ] . Hence , phosphorylation of these residues in WAVE2 could potentially affect the binding interface . In contrast to the ﬁndings with WASP we do not detect any effect of VCA domain phosphorylation on the activity of the full length WAVE2 protein in vitro ( data not shown ) . Like WASP , the full length WAVE2 protein is considerably more active than the isolated VCA domain [ Cory et al . , 2003 ] and our unpublished data , suggesting that other determinants in the protein can overcome the inhibitory effect caused by phosphoryla - tion of ser482 and ser484 in vitro . Our cellular experiments show that mutation of the ﬁve phosphorylation sites within the WAVE2 A domain generate a protein with properties resembling the D VCA mutant more than the wild - type . In cases such as protru - sion raggedness and persistence , the phenotypes are more extreme for the 5A phospho - mutant than the D VCA mutant . This may indicate that the 5A protein is still able to bind actin and sequester it from other , compensatory , nucleation pathways . The 5A phospho - mutant VCA domain has a low afﬁnity for the Arp2 / 3 complex , and while this does not appear to be important for the activity of the isolated VCA domain in vitro , it is possible that a high afﬁnity is required to generate a signiﬁcant concentration of a WAVE2 / Arp2 / 3 complex in vivo . The loss of rufﬂes and the irregular protrusions formed in scratch - wounding assays in the presence of non - phosphorylatable WAVE2 , suggest that phosphoryl - ation of the WAVE2 VCA domain is crucial for normal WAVE2 function . In particular the ragged leading edges of scratch - wound cells suggest that the integrity of cell protrusion is compromised . This could potentially be explained by disrupted lamellipodium formation as would be expected in a cell lacking functional WAVE2 [ Kunda et al . , 2003 ; Yan et al . , 2003 ] . This may in turn explain the loss of persistent migration , another pheno - type observed in WAVE2 depleted cells [ Danson et al . , 2007 ] . CONCLUSIONS The questions remain as to the nature of the regula - tion of these phosphorylation events . It appears that phosphorylation is constitutive and not signal dependent , although there may well be stimuli / cellular events that trigger dephosphorylation that we have not yet identiﬁed . Bearing in mind the impact of phosphorylations on VCA domain function it is interesting to note the number of sites in various WASP / WAVE family members - WASP / N - WASP have two sites , WAVE2 has ﬁve sites only three of which are found in WAVE1 and four of which in WAVE3 . Could phosphorylation of the VCA domain be a way of introducing distinct levels of activity and functions of the distinct isoforms ?
