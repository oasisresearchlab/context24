Fostering acts of care for the environment is a complex endeavor entailing multi - lifespan relations to people and institutions , to the environment and other non - human actors , and to existing infrastructures and processes . The workshop addresses such challenges by exploring the role of data , and the work of mak - ing them actionable for the many actors involved in protecting the environment . It will bring together interdisciplinary scholars , repre - sentatives of public institutions , activists , environmental collectives , and IT practitioners interested in the design of more sustainable futures . The workshop will discuss analytical and design issues of data - enabled sustainability , along with the practical opportunities of using data to infrastructure acts of care for the environment . The workshop will accommodate up to twenty participants and will be mainly run on - site . CCS CONCEPTS • Human - centered computing → Human computer interac - tion ( HCI ) .

Domains as diverse as waste management , water and air quality , food systems , biodiversity , energy consump - tion , traffic and transportation have become areas of relevance for data - centered environmental care . Extracting patterns of behaviors , quantifying environmental harm , or predicting societal and indi - vidual changes show the potential of using machine learning and big - data artificial intelligence to develop awareness and support decision - making in contexts of sustainability . The techno - centrism of such approaches , however , overlooks the socio - ecological rela - tions and the collaborative work underpinning both the creation and use of environmental data ( see [ 11 ] [ 29 ] ) . Moreover , it resists the more - than - human perspectives that can be encompassed in structuring data and caring for the environment . This narrow fo - cus on data fails to capture processes and interactions whereby data can enable sense - making about sustainability concerns , be - come a capacity to infrastructure partnerships between various actors [ 38 ] , influence governance , and create specific opportunities for environmental care ( see [ 36 ] ) . 506 CSCW ’23 Companion , October 14 – 18 , 2023 , Minneapolis , MN , USA Rossitto et al . This workshop is open to researchers , practitioners , and activists interested in sustainable interactions between humans , digital sys - tems , and the world we inhabit . It targets the many actors ( e . g . , think tanks , public institutions ) concerned with both environmental and social sustainability , participatory forms of data collection ( e . g . , Cit - izen Sciences projects ) , alternative representations of data ( e . g . , by the inclusion of indigenous perspectives ) , and explorations of vari - ous data - centered sociotechnical advances . We invite participants to investigate the potential benefits and multiple challenges of a data - enabled , multi - stakeholder , action - oriented approach that takes seriously the cooperative work underpinning computer - supported efforts for environmental sustainability . 2 BACKGROUND Actions aiming at more sustainable futures are bound up in care , and a turn towards action is also a turn toward caring about the environment [ 36 ] . This ethical standpoint is framed by the commit - ments and attachments that different stakeholders develop towards environmentally - concerned actions , and by the partnerships and relations such stakeholders develop with specific socio - ecological contexts , not only with digital technologies . Data – in the broad sense of information about a certain entity or phenomenon – have the potential to promote and initiate actions toward more sustainable futures . The acquisition , representation , and accessibility of data about our environment ( e . g . , data on harm - ful air particles , or global temperature patterns ) have , to a large degree , resulted in increased awareness and in - depth understanding of global sustainability issues . Providing awareness about specific pollutants might , for instance , inspire people to change individual behaviors and habits . Societal and infrastructural changes require , however , more ecological understandings of how environmental data become meaningful and actionable . Different studies have explored ways to use data in sustainability contexts , by focusing on physical data artifacts ( e . g . , [ 12 , 32 , 37 ] ) , data - enabled negotiations ( e . g . , [ 8 , 9 , 31 ] ) , embodied experiences of data ( e . g . , [ 4 , 30 ] ) , data imaginaries [ 39 – 41 ] , or data transparency . Prior HCI research has outlined diverse approaches to collect and visualize environmental data for diverse stakeholder groups . We draw on this scholarship for an initial framing of the workshop’s discussions . Data collection can be broadly categorized as follows : 1 ) Public - private partnerships , which often include government and technologist stakeholders but lack the expertise of residents [ 10 ] , which may , thus , leave little room for resident agency [ 15 , 19 , 23 ] ; 2 ) Crowdsourced , which cedes some power to residents but may exclude minority groups [ 14 ] and can make residents feel like data sources rather than collaborators [ 1 ] ; 3 ) Community - driven , which enables local communities to drive design decisions and can in - crease community engagement [ 2 , 24 ] , but can exclude essential municipal stakeholders [ 21 ] and put an excess burden on the com - munities most affected by environmental harms [ 17 , 42 ] ; 4 ) Par - ticipatory , which engage residents as collaborators in co - design through activities such as workshops [ 3 , 18 , 22 , 23 ] , but can lead to projects without feedback from government agents [ 21 ] who are es - sential stakeholders in leading to environmental policy changes [ 26 ] . Environmental data visualizations often include mapping platforms , timelines , and dashboards [ 7 , 13 , 28 ] , which allow users to compare the data to other spatially and / or temporally correlated phenomena , but risk simplifying the complex interactions that both drive and provide solutions for environmental issues [ 34 ] . Physically situated visualizations have been shown to drive engagement and create community sensemaking and education opportunities [ 11 , 35 , 43 ] , yet there is still a need for environmental data visualizations that enable diverse stakeholders to easily manipulate data and work together collaboratively for environmental care [ 11 ] . Furthering this scholarship , this workshop will develop concep - tual , empirical , and technological investigations showing how the creation and use of environmental data are shaped by sociotechnical practices and by the work performed by various actors to promote , or hinder , acts of care for the environment . Moreover , it sets out to explore the collaborations and partnerships that make the use of environmental data possible , as well as the political , ethical , and economic relations underpinning the creation of such alliances . 2 . 1 Topics of interest Authors may wish to address a range of themes including but not limited to : Making data actionable . Technology is never neutral and neither are the visual and tangible representations and the embedded data structures that characterize environmental data . As specific tech - nological features , such qualities uniquely shape the uptake of concrete actions to responsibly inhabit , protect , or restore the en - vironment . We invite discussions on how and when data become meaningful , the different practices and collaborations that make them meaningful , and on the different values data might have for different actors and stakeholders . Challenges associated with data literacy , transparency , or data ownership are relevant to this theme . We encourage contributions illustrating the partnerships , power relations , and political and economic factors ( e . g . , relations between technology and governance , business models ) that underpin the creation of environmental data , and that shape how data can be used for environmental sustainability . Entangling data . Scholarship within Sustainable HCI ( SHCI ) has outlined the need to focus on current circumstances to understand what can be in the future . Eli Blevis’ call [ 5 ] to ‘See What Is and What Can Be’ puts emphasis on the production of action ( as op - posed to the mere action ) as relevant to understand how sustainable actions come to be , and how design matters in the ecology of that action . Relatedly , our previous work [ 33 , 36 ] has emphasized that acts of care for the environment can be seen as interconnected and additive . This practically means considering how the outcomes of specific interventions ( e . g . , collection of data about urban littering ) can activate other acts of environmental care ( e . g . , from policy - making to developing awareness ) , and what type of resources ( e . g . , evidence to enforce policy change , educational material ) such out - comes become in that context . We invite authors to discuss case studies that illustrate the mechanisms and processes whereby data become actionable . This can include the participatory production of data , the development of multi - stakeholders collaborations , in - teractions with governance , policy , and policy - making . Accounts of the political and power dynamics that might actually hinder the 507 Data - Enabled Sustainability CSCW ’23 Companion , October 14 – 18 , 2023 , Minneapolis , MN , USA disclosure of environmental data ( e . g . , air pollution ) are particularly relevant to this theme . Situating data . Studies within SHCI have been criticized for ab - stracting and simplifying sustainable actions , by merely focusing on individual behaviors , attitudes , and cognition [ 6 , 16 , 20 , 27 ] . We welcome theoretical and analytical frameworks , as well as design interventions and examples of existing technologies that highlight the ecology of relations that exist between environmental data , en - vironmentally sustainable practices , and broader social contexts – e . g . , physical infrastructures , governance , the law and other regula - tions . While the “good” of data is often associated with the idea that data can easily grow and globally scale up , we invite authors to re - flect on the locally bound qualities of environmental care , the global relevance of data collected at specific localities , and the extent to which aggregated data sets can mobilize actions across contexts . 2 . 2 Workshop goals The workshop aims at developing visions and possible scenarios to use data from within an action - oriented perspective to sustainabil - ity . The workshop’s goals can be summarized as follows : ( 1 ) Identify data sources and structures that can better address urging environmental actions ; ( 2 ) Identify conceptual , empirical , and technological examples that unpack how data can become resources to structure collective acts of care for the environment ; ( 3 ) Account for power structures embedded in data sources , the interfaces and affordances that enable their creation and representation , as well as in the narratives that promote the use of such data ; ( 4 ) Account for the political , ethical , and power relations that underpin the creation of partnerships , collaborative projects , or design interventions whereby environmental data are made available and become contextually meaningful and instrumental to environmental protection . ( 5 ) Brainstorm ideas for future studies that can contribute better understandings of data - enabled sustainability and the work to infrastructure action - oriented sustainability ; ( 6 ) Synthesize ideas into future plans for research collaborations and dissemination beyond the time frame of the workshop ( 7 ) Develop strategies to encourage collaborations and partner - ships between researchers , practitioners , public and private institutions , and other actors for whom data can be a means to structure and sustain environmental care over time . 3 PRE - WORKSHOP PLAN The call for participation and other workshop - related information will be made available at the following link : http : / / www . sustws . medieteknik . info . We will circulate the workshop call through the organizers’ pro - fessional networks ( e . g . , EUSSET ) , relevant mailing lists , and social media groups ( e . g . , CHI Meta , CSCW Meta , Researchers of the socio - technical , personal social media accounts ) . Authors are invited to submit a 2 - 4 page position paper follow - ing the ACM single - column format – either by using the Word or LaTeX template . To promote broader participation ( including but not limited to activists , representatives of the public sector , collectives , or industry practitioners ) , we offer the option to sub - mit other research and design materials , such as design portfolios , short manifestos , pictorials , and design fictions . We encourage au - thors to explicitly address their interest in the workshop themes . We welcome reports of design cases , data sets , empirical results , theoretical pieces , or short calls for future research . Submissions will be reviewed by the workshop organizers and selected based on their quality , novelty , relevance to the workshop’s topics , and potential to spark discussion . In selecting the contributions , we will aim for a good balance of perspectives and cases . Given the authors’ consent , the submitted papers will be made available at the above - mentioned website before the workshop , to give participants the time to familiarize themselves with each contribution . We will do our best to accommodate specific accessibility needs . Authors will be invited to specify any particular requirement in their position papers , or to directly contact the organizers . 3 . 1 Key dates The workshop’s planned key dates are : • July 6st , 2023 : the workshop call is advertised • August 31st , 2023 : submission deadline for authors . • September 10th , 2023 : notification of acceptance . • Saturday , October 15th , 2023 : Workshop at CSCW 2023 4 WORKSHOP STRUCTURE The workshop is organized as a one - day event with presentations , design explorations , and discussions ( see table for an overview of the day ) . To jointly develop visions and identify challenges con - nected to the ways environmental actions can be infrastructured through data , we will limit the time spent on presentations of po - sition papers . By situating parts of the workshop in the outdoor setting of the city of Minneapolis , we aim to gather real - life exam - ples that can serve as inspiration for the conversations and activities that will follow . We believe this setup will contribute to creating an open - minded and playful atmosphere to engage with the workshop topics . 5 POST - WORKSHOP PLAN The workshop aims at building community between researchers and practitioners with an interest in environmental sustainability , particularly in how collective acts of care for the environment can be infrastructured and enabled through data . The workshop will act as an initial step for fostering long - term collaborations , including the organization of future events ( e . g . , organizing research work - shops or other joint research activities ) . We aim to write a piece for ACM Interactions to outline the most challenging and inspirational outcomes of the workshop and point to future opportunities for joint research . Participants’ suggestions on possible future actions will also be discussed at the workshop . Given the participants’ con - sent , the position papers will remain available at the workshop’s website . 6 CALL FOR PARTICIPATION ‘The Collective Work of Turning Data into Actions for Environmen - tal Care’ workshop explores the intersections between data , diverse 508 CSCW ’23 Companion , October 14 – 18 , 2023 , Minneapolis , MN , USA Rossitto et al .
