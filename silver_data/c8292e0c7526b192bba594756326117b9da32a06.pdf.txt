ABSTRACT The burden of premature death and health loss from ESRD is well described . Less is known regarding the burden of cardiovascular disease attributable to reduced GFR . We estimated the prevalence of reduced GFR categories 3 , 4 , and 5 ( not on RRT ) for 188 countries at six time points from 1990 to 2013 . Relative risks of cardiovascular outcomes by three categories of reduced GFR were calculated by pooled random effects meta - analysis . Results are presented as deaths for outcomes of cardiovascular disease and ESRD and as disability - adjusted life years for outcomes of cardiovascular disease , GFR categories 3 , 4 , and 5 , and ESRD . In 2013 , reduced GFR was associated with 4 % of deaths worldwide , or 2 . 2 million deaths ( 95 % uncertainty interval [ 95 % UI ] , 2 . 0 to 2 . 4 million ) . More than half of these attributable deaths were cardiovascular deaths ( 1 . 2 million ; 95 % UI , 1 . 1 to 1 . 4 million ) , whereas 0 . 96 million ( 95 % UI , 0 . 81 to 1 . 0 million ) were ESRD - related deaths . Compared with metabolic risk factors , reduced GFR ranked below high systolic BP , high body mass index , and high fasting plasma glucose , and similarly with high total cholesterol as a risk factor for disability - adjusted life years in both developed and developing world regions . In conclusion , by 2013 , cardiovascular deaths attributed to reduced GFR outnumbered ESRD deaths throughout the world . Stud - ies are needed to evaluate the bene ﬁ t of early detection of CKD and treatment to decrease these deaths .

In the United States , it is estimated that 13 . 1 % of adults have CKD , and that CKD prevalence has been increasing over time . 1 A survey in Japan found 19 . 1 % of the adult population have CKD . 2 Determining CKD burden within de - veloping countries is more challenging . A recent meta - analysis of CKD prevalence of any stage in sub - Saharan Africa estimated a population prevalence of 13 . 9 % among adults , although the analysis was lim - ited by availability of few high - quality data sources . 3 A recent survey in two Indian cities found one in 12 individuals have CKD , and among those with CKD almost 80 % were assessed to be at high risk for a car - diovascular ( CV ) event . 4 These dataindicate that CKD is common in diverse parts of the world . ThehealthandsocialeffectsofCKDpatientswho progress to ESRD are well known . 5 – 7 The burden of health loss and premature mortality to CV disease within the CKD population is less known . Increas - ing severity of predialysis reduced GFR is associated with a higher likelihood of CV disease diagnoses , severity , and death . 8 – 11 Many studies have subse - quently demonstrated a consistent association between reduced GFR and speci ﬁ c CV diagnoses of congestive heart failure , myocardial infarction , stroke , and peripheral vascular disease . 8 , 12 – 14 This independent contribution of reduced GFR to the fatal and nonfatal CV disease burden has not yet been quanti ﬁ ed at a population level .

RESULTS Global Reduced - GFR Mortality and Disability adjusted life - years in 2013 In 2013 , 2 . 2 million deaths were associated with reduced GFR ( Figure 1A , Table 1 ) . 17 Nearly 52 million disability - adjusted life years ( DALYs ) were associated with reduced GFR ( Figure 1B , Table 1 ) . These attributable deaths and DALYs account for 3 . 9 % of total global deaths and 2 . 1 % of total global DALYs in 2013 , respectively ( Table 1 ) . Changes in Reduced GFR DALY Rates since 1990 At the global level , among all ages , GFR - attributable median DALY counts have increased by 52 . 0 % , respectively , whereas age - standardized rates of DALYs associated with reduced GFR have decreased by 8 . 1 % , respectively ( Supplemental Table 1 , Tables 1 and 2 ) . Compared with other metabolic risk factors , since 1990 , among all ages , DALYs attributed to high fasting glucose ( 69 . 6 % ; 95 % uncertainty interval [ 95 % UI ] , 60 . 9 to 78 . 7 ) , high total cholesterol ( 26 . 9 % ; 95 % UI , 19 . 8 to 36 . 3 ) , and high BP ( 49 . 1 % ; 95 % UI , 43 . 2 to 55 . 2 ) have all increased ( Supplemental Figure 1 ) . Age - standardized DALY rates for the risk factors high BP ( 2 16 . 5 mmHg ; 95 % UI , 2 20 . 0 to 2 12 . 5 ) and high total cholesterol ( 2 27 . 5 ; 95 % UI , 2 31 . 5 to 2 22 . 1 ) have decreased , whereas DALY rates associated with high fasting glucose have remained relatively constant ( 0 . 2 % ; 95 % UI , 2 4 . 8 to 5 . 6 ) . Geographic Patterns for Reduced GFR Mortality in 2013 Among super - regions , reduced GFR ranked highest in Latin America and the Caribbean ( ﬁ fth ) , with 7 . 0 % of total attrib - uted deaths and outranking metabolic risk factor high total cholesterol ( seventh ) .

Re - ducedGFRrankedlowestinsub - SaharanAfrica ( 16th ) , butstill outranked high total cholesterol ( 25th ) with regards to deaths ( Figures 2 and 3 ) . CV Disease Attributed to Reduced GFR In 2013 , globally there were 1 . 2 million CV deaths attributed to reduced GFR , with an age - standardized rate of 20 . 8 deaths per 100 , 000 ( Table 2 ) . Since 1990 , reduced GFR – associated CV deaths have increased by 33 . 8 % ( 95 % UI , 24 . 6 to 43 . 8 ) , whereas the age - standardized GFR - attributable rate has de - creased by 28 . 6 % ( Table 2 ) . The 2013 age - standardized CV mortality rate within the developing world ( 21 . 5 per 100 , 000 ) was slightly higher than in the developed world ( 19 . 2 per 100 , 000 ) ( Table 2 ) . Notably , the age - standardized CV mortal - ity rate in the developing world has decreased slightly since 1990 ( 9 . 5 % decline ) , whereas the developed world has demonstrated a 44 % decline in age - standardized CV mortality ( Table 2 ) . Reduced GFR was responsible for 18 . 7 million CV DALYs in 2013 among all ages , with an age - standardized rate of 304 . 2 DALYS per 100 , 000 ( Figure 4 , Table 3 ) . The developing world had a higher rate , as well as a smaller decrease in rate since 1990 , when compared with the developed world ( Table 3 ) . Among super - regions , the highest age - standardized GFR - attributed CV mortality rates were estimated for Central Eu - rope , Eastern Europe , Central Asia , and sub - Saharan Africa ( Table 2 ) . Since 1990 , GFR - attributed CV mortality rates in sub - Saharan Africa and South Asia tended to increase , as op - posed to all other super - regions . The high - income super - region demonstrated the greatest decrease in mortality rate since 1990 ( Table 2 ) . ESRD Deaths and CKD DALYs Globally there were 956 , 246 ( 95 % UI , 812 , 896 to 1 , 034 , 491 ) deaths because of ESRD in 2013 , with an age - standardized rate of 15 . 8 per 100 , 000 ( Table 2 ) . Since 1990 , both the number of deaths ( 134 . 6 % ; 95 % UI , 115 . 7 % to 150 . 2 % ) and age - standardized mortality rate ( 36 . 9 % ) have increased ( Table 2 ) . The age - standardized mortality rate in the developing world was almost twice that of the developed , and has increased by 44 . 7 % since 1990 , compared with the 9 . 8 % increase within the developed world ( Table 2 ) . The super - region with highest ESRD mortality rate in 2013 was Latin America and the Caribbean , with an ESRD mortality rate of 32 per 100 , 000 , which is almost double the global rate ( Table 2 ) . South Asia demonstrated the greatest increase in CKD deaths ( 82 . 9 % ) since 1990 , although all developing super - regions demonstrated an increase in ESRD mortality ( Table 2 ) .

J Am Soc Nephrol 28 : 2167 – 2179 , 2017 Health Outcomes of Reduced GFR 2169 www . jasn . org CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY At the global level , age - standardized CKD DALY rates have increased by 12 . 3 % , but this increase largely occurred within the developing world ( Table 3 ) . In 2013 , CKD DALY rates were highest in the Latin America and the Caribbean region ( 829 per 100 , 000 ) , and lowest for Central Europe , Eastern Europe , Central Asia ( 398 per 100 , 000 ) and Southeast Asia , East Asia , andOceania ( 393per100 , 000 ) ( Figure5 , Table3 ) . Age - standardized rates have decreased in three world regions since 1990 ( Cen - tral Europe , Eastern Europe , and Central Asia [ 2 6 . 7 % ] ; high - income [ 2 0 . 7 % ] ; and North Africa and Middle East [ 2 3 . 1 % ] ) ( Table 3 ) . The largest increases in age - standardized CKD DALY rates occurred in Latin America and the Caribbean ( 39 . 1 % ) and South Asia ( 39 . 6 % ) , driving the notable increase in the CKD DALY rate within the developing world in comparison to the developed world . DISCUSSION TheGlobalBurdenofDisease ( GBD ) Study2013ranksreduced GFR as the 12th leading risk factor for CVand ESRD deaths at the global level , and the 14th leading risk factor for DALYs among 79 risk factors in 2013 . 17 Within world regions such as high - income and Latin America and the Caribbean , the mor - tality ranking was as high as eighth and ﬁ fth , respectively . This analysis provides granular detail regarding the contribution of CV disease caused by reduced GFR to these rankings . In 2013 , . 2 million deaths and 52 million DALYs were associated with reduced GFR . More than half of attributable deaths were es - timated to have occurred secondary to CV disease . The GBD Study indicates that in 1990 , the developed world demonstrated notably higher rates of total CV disease among all ages than in developing world regions . Over time , the bur - den ofage - standardized fatalCVdiseasehasmarkedlydeclined in the developed world , whereas it has largely remained stable within developing regions . 18 These shifting patterns of total CV disease activity in the developed and developing worlds are driving the overall pattern of GFR - attributable CV DALYand death activity . There are likely three factors contributing to the change in prevalence of total CV disease within the developing world . First , improved success in treating leading causes of premature mortality within resource - limited nations , mainly related to infectious diseases and maternal – perinatal mortal - ity , has allowed individuals to reach more advanced age and thus develop conditions related to aging . 18 – 20 Second , the shift in diet toward greater intake of animal fat and high - caloric food has been documented within the developing world for at least the past decade , facilitating CV disease development . Third , limited implementation of CV risk factor detection , treatment , and disease management within the developing world in the setting of a growing burden has led to sustained mortality rates . 18 , 20 , 21 The differences between age - standardized and all age rates merit further research . Our results showing the attributable CV burden within the developed world may illustrate the success within regions such T a b l e 2 .

RegardingESRDdeathsandCKDDALYs , recentmeta - analyses have estimated . 2 million individuals to have died prema - turely in 2010 because of lack of access to dialysis , and that the majority of these deaths occurred within Southeast Asia and Africa . 23 , 24 Sim - ilar to these estimates , our results indicate a high burden of CKD DALYs to have oc - curred in sub - Saharan Africa , but our re - sults also highlight the very high burden of CKD DALYs in Mexico , most likely re - lated to their extraordinarily high rate of diabetes mellitus . 25 Despite high death rates to ESRD within world regions with no ESRD care access , the literature also de - scribes the encouraging statistic of growth in dialysis provision over the past two de - cades . Studies indicate that this growth relates more to government expansion of dialysis programs rather than the increase in causative diseases of ESRD , such as dia - betes and hypertension . 24 Considering this , attention needs to be paid to ESRD prevention strategies alongside continued development of ESRD programs . The potential public health bene ﬁ ts of CKD screening have been evaluated in the past . 15 , 24 – 26 Cost - effectiveness CKD screening studies that fully incorporated fatal and nonfatal CV outcomes as well as incident ESRD have concluded CKD screening within the general population to be cost - effective , in opposition to results of studies that only incorporated ESRD outcomes and fatal CV disease . 16 , 29 , 30 These results are the ﬁ rst to quantify and compare ESRD and reduced GFR attribut - able CVoutcomes across developed and de - veloping nations , and illustrate that ESRD represents less than half of health events attributable to reduced GFR , even within the developing world . This reiterates the importance of CV fatal and nonfatal dis - ease incorporation into evaluations of the health and economic bene ﬁ ts of population CKD screening . Within low - and middle - income countries , it is possible that CKD screening is of even higher importance in forestalling ESRD development , because RRT is limited in more than half of the world ’ s countries . 24 Evidence exists from randomized controlled trials of the bene ﬁ t of statins in lowering CV morbidity . 33 A recent major meta - analysis described that intensive BP control tended to reduce the relative risk of some CV outcomes , although not CV mortality or ESRD development . 34 There is need for sim - ilar evidence demonstrating that diagnosing CKD early and slowing CKD progression lowers CV disease incidence and mortality . There are strong arguments that population - level CKD screening using urinary albumin and GFR measurement could potentially complement screening for hypertension and Figure 2 .

A nonpro ﬁ t organization within Cambodia uses a community health worker approach to screen rural Cambodian adults for diabetes , hypertension , obesity , and CKD , and initiates treatment for these conditions , paired with diet and lifestyle modi ﬁ cation and strict follow - up . 38 Results from this organization indicatevery favorable con - trol of diabetes mellitus , hypertension , and CKD progression . 39 Similar results have been published for chronic disease outreach programs in the Philippines and the Democratic Republic of Congo . 40 Such screening and management interventions illustrate the importance and feasibility of chronic disease detection and management to delay progression , even in remote set - tings . Within the developed region , although CKD DALY rates have decreased slightly since 1990 , mortality rates have not , which couldbeexplained inpartby increas - ing age at death . This is in notable contrast to the almost 45 % reduction over that time period in CV disease deaths associated with reduced GFR within the developed world . Success in addressing this CKD burden will likely involve continued efforts at early di - agnosis and treatment of hypertension , di - abetes mellitus , and early - stage CKD . These measures will also be necessary within de - veloping nations , coupled with infrastruc - ture development for treatment of ESRD . 31 , 32 Within certain regions , unique contrib - utors to ESRD development require fo - cused attention by that nation ’ s health care infrastructure . This concerns not only diabetes mellitus , hypertension , HIV , and other well known factors leading to kidney damage , but also the CKDu , the lat - ter studied recently mainly in speci ﬁ c Latin American and Southeast Asian coun - tries , 41 – 45 with several hypothesized causes , including environmental exposures , tox - ins , and climate change . To date , there is no clear leading etiological factor . 36 CKDu often targets young men to a higher degree than CKD caused by known fac - tors , 41 – 45 and is now considered endemic in countries such as Sri Lanka , India , El Salvador , and Nicaragua , and is the leading cause of hospital deaths in El Salvador . 36 , 37 The challenges surrounding the CKDu ep - idemic exemplify how methods for detecting and addressing CKD burden may have to extend beyond screening for tradi - tional CKD risk factors within classically de ﬁ ned high - risk portions of the population , in order to prevent ESRD deaths and CKD DALYs . Making global estimates inherently requires assumptions andhaslimitations . First , CKDprevalencedatawereonlyavail - able for 44 countries ; among . 1000 surveys , methods were often not optimal ; and within most countries , not all time points were included . The Bayesian methods provide the best estimates possible but are limited by the quality of the available data . Furthermore , inconsistency of data collection of time and world region could in ﬂ uence trends and geo - graphic variation . An area for improvement of this analysis would involve incorporating albuminuria into the exposure de ﬁ nition for the population - attributable fractions ( PAF ) cal - culation ; there is strong evidence in the literature demonstrat - ing the independent association between albuminuria and CV events , in isolation of and in addition to reduced GFR . 46 Thus , the estimates that we present might possibly underestimate the true burden of CV events associated with CKD . These limita - tions serve as steps for improvement of future estimations . Figure 3 . Fluctuating ranking of GFR risk factor by world region in 2013 .

Further strengths involve our ability to estimate fatal and nonfatal burden for speci ﬁ c CV diseases as well as ESRD throughout the world and across time . Reduced GFR - attributable CV deaths outnumber ESRD deaths at the global level , and the death rate from ESRD is increasing throughout the world and is a leading cause of death in world regions such as Latin America and the Caribbean . Efforts to forestall such rates will involve earlier detection of CKD . Affordable means of detecting early - stage CKD are avail - able , as well as affordable means of treating early - stage CKD to delay progression . 47 In order to evaluate whether such screening methods should be recommended for the general popula - tion , further cost - effectiveness analyses will need to be con - ducted that incorporate the 1 . 2 million reduced GFR - attributable CV disease deaths . It will be dif ﬁ cult to alter death rates within the CKD population without such studies and screening efforts . CONCISE METHODS Study Overview This analysis follows the risk assessment framework used in the 2013 GBD Study for 79 individual and combined risk factors , where prev - alence of the exposure is determined , a theoretical minimum risk is de ﬁ ned , and the relative risk of a causally - related health outcome is quanti ﬁ ed ( Supplemental Appendix 1 , Supplemental Table 3 ) . 17 , 48 PAFs We calculated the CV fatal and nonfatal burden attributable to the categorical exposure of reduced GFR categories using the following equation : PAF ¼ ∑ ni ¼ 1 P i ð RR i 2 1 Þ ∑ ni ¼ 1 P i ð RR i 2 1 Þ þ 1 where RR i is the relative risk for exposure level i , P i is the proportion of the population in that exposure category , and n is the number of exposure categories . 49 Exposure An overview of the modeling method used for determining country - level prevalence of GFR categories , 15 ml / min per 1 . 73 m 2 ( not on dialysis ) , 15 – 29 ml / min per 1 . 73 m 2 , and 30 – 59 ml / min per 1 . 73 m 2 is provided in Supplemental Appendices 2 and 5 . We used these coun - try - level prevalence estimates of reduced GFR categories as our exposure categories ( Supplemental Tables 4 – 6 ) . Relative Risk Determination Relative risks of CVoutcomes of ischemic heart disease and stroke per GFRexposure category were derived from cohort data included in the Figure 4 . Higher burden of cardiovascular disability - adjusted life years ( DALYs ) by world region in 2013 . Cardiovascular DALYS per 100 , 000 attributable to reduced GFR in 2013 .

We attributed 100 % of ESRD incidence and mortality to reduced GFR ( details provided in Supplemental Appendix 3 , Relative Risk Determination ) . Outcomes CV outcomes of ischemic heart disease , stroke , as well as peripheral vascular disease , ESRD deaths , and CKD DALYs at the country , age , sex , and year level were obtained from the 2013 GBD Study ( Supple - mental Appendix 4 ) .
