Smith @ warwick . ac . uk E ndocytosis enables material to be absorbed via specific ligand - receptor interactions through the assembly of specialized pro - tein coats around vesicles formed from the plasma membrane . In the case of clathrin - mediated endocytosis , three - legged clathrin structures called triskelia form a latticed scaffold around the out - side of a vesicle derived from the plasma membrane and coordinate binding of a network of adapter proteins , which together drive cargo selection , vesicle formation and detachment from the membrane 1 , 2 . Clathrin - coated vesicles have been seen to emerge directly from flat clathrin lattices indicating that clathrin assemblies adapt to changes in membrane shape at endocytic sites 3 . Avinoam et al . 4 provided evidence that these changes may be enabled by the rapid exchange of clathrin triskelia 5 with the membrane - bound clathrin coat . The multiple shapes adopted by the assemblies observed in cells are also seen with purified clathrin , which forms cages with different archi - tectures 6 . The ability of clathrin to form diverse structures is inher - ently determined by its molecular structure but how this occurs has remained unclear . The role of clathrin in endocytosis is mediated through engage - ment with adapter proteins , most notably the heterotetrameric complex AP - 2 , which interacts with clathrin through a ‘clathrin box’ motif on an extended linker region within its β 2 - adaptin subunit and through a binding site on the β 2 - appendage domain 7 – 9 , which interacts with the ankle domain of clathrin 10 . AP - 1 , a homolog of AP - 2 , engages with clathrin during intracellular trafficking . A series of elegant studies leading to structures of the AP - 1 ( refs . 11 – 14 ) and AP - 2 ( refs . 15 – 18 ) core domains have made transformative advances in our understanding of adaptor proteins but , despite these , the nature of the interaction of these key complexes with assembled clathrin is not fully understood . While NMR and X - ray studies of the clathrin terminal domain bound to β - arrestin 2 ( ref . 19 ) and adapter binding motifs 20 – 23 revealed multiple adapter protein binding sites on the clathrin terminal domain , understanding how such interactions are coordinated within the context of a growing clathrin coat requires a molecular level understanding of the clathrin scaffold with which they must engage . This highlights the importance of obtaining high - resolution structural information of clathrin in its assembled form . Clathrin can be purified from endogenous clathrin - coated vesi - cles and reconstituted into cage structures reminiscent of the clath - rin polyhedral lattices seen in cells . The symmetry adopted by some of these cages led to their exploitation for single - particle structural studies by cryo - EM as early as 1986 ( refs . 24 , 25 ) . Furthermore , clath - rin cryo - EM structures have revealed the arrangement of clathrin triskelia within a cage 26 – 28 , and the location of bound auxilin and Hsc70 ( refs . 29 – 32 ) . X - ray structures of the clathrin proximal , termi - nal and linker domains provided atomic resolution information for these individual domains 33 , 34 and a crystallographic study 35 of clathrin hubs revealed coordinated changes in light and heavy chain conformation suggesting that the light chain could regulate assem - bly by influencing changes in knee conformation . In 2004 , a 7 . 9 Å cryo - EM map of assembled clathrin provided an ɑ - carbon model of a hexagonal barrel cage 28 that revealed the location of the clath - rin light chains and a helical tripod structure at the trimerization domain ( TxD ) . Here we present a higher resolution map and molecular model for assembled clathrin . Details of the interactions made by the tri - pod of helices identified previously 28 are now much clearer , experi - mentally proving that it adopts a coiled - coil structure . Density for the key light chain tryptophans is now visible , enabling the light chain interaction with the proximal domain to be further defined .

Smith 1 * Clathrin forms diverse lattice and cage structures that change size and shape rapidly in response to the needs of eukaryotic cells during clathrin - mediated endocytosis and intracellular trafficking . We present the cryo - EM structure and molecular model of assembled porcine clathrin , providing insights into interactions that stabilize key elements of the clathrin lattice , namely , between adjacent heavy chains , at the light chain – heavy chain interface and within the trimerization domain . Furthermore , we report cryo - EM maps for five different clathrin cage architectures . Fitting structural models to three of these maps shows that their assembly requires only a limited range of triskelion leg conformations , yet inherent flexibility is required to maintain con - tacts . Analysis of the protein – protein interfaces shows remarkable conservation of contact sites despite architectural variation . These data reveal a universal mode of clathrin assembly that allows variable cage architecture and adaptation of coated vesicle size and shape during clathrin - mediated vesicular trafficking or endocytosis .

Furthermore , structural analysis of three different clathrin cage architectures reveals how these archi - tectures can arise as a result of flexibility at defined positions on the clathrin leg combined with remarkable conservation of contact sites between the heavy chain legs . Thus , clathrin adopts a univer - sal mode of assembly that allows variable cage geometry and may facilitate the rapid adaptation of coated vesicle size and shape dur - ing clathrin - mediated vesicular trafficking or endocytosis . Results Multiple clathrin cage architectures . We determined structures of five clathrin cage architectures ( Fig . 1a ) from 12 , 785 particles selected from cryo - EM images of endogenous clathrin assembled in the presence of the clathrin - binding domain of β 2 - adaptin ( Supplementary Note 1a ) . We found that incorporating β 2 - adaptin into the cages promoted the formation of more regular cage struc - tures , as reported previously 9 . To address the challenge that the mul - tiple cage types in the sample presented for structural analysis , cages were identified using a library of ten cage architectures built in silico ( Fig . 1b ) . Schein and Sands - Kidner had proposed that these were the most likely stable structures to be formed for cages with fewer than 60 vertices 36 . A supervised and subsequent unsupervised structure classification scheme determined the five cage architectures , which could be refined to nominal resolutions of 24 – 9 . 1 Å ( Supplementary Notes 1c – e , 2 and 3 , Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1 ) . Mini coat cage and hub substructure . The most abundant clath - rin architecture was the mini coat cage , which reached the highest resolution of 9 . 1 Å ( Fig . 1c and Supplementary Note 3 ) . We note that the terminal domain densities are weaker than the main cage density due to domain flexibility , and consequently adapter binding was not resolved . The density around the mini coat is observed to be variable ( Supplementary Video 1 ) and presented an opportunity for further structural averaging . Thus , to improve the resolution further , we used subparticle extraction and refinement 37 to obtain the structure of the invariant mini coat hub , which encompasses the vertex of the cage . This yielded an improved map resolution of 5 . 1 Å . The subparticle extraction and refinement procedure was repeated for all five of the cage architectures , determining the invariant hub 28 Mini coat 32 Sweet potato 36 D6 barrel 36 Tennis ball 37 Big apple 90° 20 Dice 24 Brussel 26 Pumpkin 28 Mini coat 32 Sweet potato ( L ) 32 Sweet potato ( R ) 36 Barrel 36 Tennis ball 38 Big apple ( L ) 38 Big apple ( R ) 200 Å a b c Fig . 1 | Identification of multiple clathrin cage architectures . a , Cryo - EM maps of five clathrin cage architectures with resolutions between 24 and 9 . 1 Å . b , A library of cage architectures with 20 – 38 vertices 36 used for particle classification , as described in ‘data processing’ . c , Cryo - EM map of the mini coat architecture ( left ) with four triskelia highlighted to show quaternary level interactions .

All of the hub substructures were combined and refined to determine a single consensus hub structure across all determined cage types , with a global resolution of 4 . 7 Å , local resolutions reach - ing 4 . 3 Å and a marked improvement in density quality ( Fig . 2b – d and Supplementary Notes 3 and 4 ) . Such improvement indicates the invariance across all the hub substructures , even though they are from different cage structures . This improved map enabled us to build a model of the consensus clathrin hub ( Supplementary Table 2 ) . The model , built into the C 3 averaged map , contains contigu - ous segments of three heavy chains ( residues 635 – 1075 , 809 – 1474 and 1 , 250 – 1 , 629 ) and two light chains ( residues 99 – 157 of one and 99 – 165 and 189 – 225 of the other ) . Together , the heavy chain com - prises heavy chain repeat ( HCR ) 1g through to HCR7j , including the TxD ( Fig . 2a and Supplementary Table 3 ) . Within these areas of the map , local measurements report resolution ranges of 5 . 9 – 4 . 3 Å and 6 . 7 – 4 . 4 Å for the heavy and light chain , respectively , with the poorest density appearing in regions furthest from the hub . Bulky side chains from landmark aromatic residues are well - resolved to model the main chain through the density and assign the register ( Fig . 2c and Supplementary Fig . 1a ) . The model was validated using EMRinger , map - vs - model measurements and per residue attribute plots ( Supplementary Fig . 1a , b , Table 1 and Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 ) . These report reasonable statistics 38 for a model at this resolution .

Interface stabilization analysis . Our model provides insights into the interactions made by triskelion legs within a clathrin cage and our understanding of the cage assembly mechanism . A cage edge is formed from four separate triskelion legs and is composed of two antiparallel proximal domains that sit above two antiparallel distal domains ( Fig . 1c and Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . We were inter - ested in identifying areas of the structure that formed stable inter - actions and so performed an analysis of intermolecular interaction energies predicted by our model using Rosetta . Complementary analysis that accommodated uncertainty in rotamer position was made in an application of the molecular docking program , Bristol University Docking Engine ( BUDE ) 39 , 40 , where we were able to cal - culate interaction energies for all favorable rotamer positions in the model . Results from both Rosetta and BUDE calculations ( Fig . 3 and Supplementary Fig . 1c , d ) showed good agreement in energy scoring indicated by an overall cross - correlation of 0 . 80 and 0 . 81 for the heavy and light chains , respectively . To illustrate the implica - tions of these results for an entire cage , the Rosetta results obtained for the consensus hub model were mapped onto the mini coat cage map ( Fig . 3a ) . While the energy - per - residue profiles of the EM structure compared between the BUDE analysis and the Rosetta scoring after relaxation are similar , there are some differences . For example , while BUDE identifies the interaction of light chain tryp - tophan 105 with the heavy chain , this interaction is not evident in the Rosetta scoring , which is more sensitive to the conformational uncertainties associated with a map in the 4 Å resolution range . Nonetheless , results from both approaches showed strong interac - tion energies between light chain tryptophans 127 and 138 and the proximal domain , and at the TxD . This is consistent with biochemi - cal studies that have shown that two light chain tryptophans ( W105 and W127 ) are required for light chain binding to the heavy chain 41 , and demonstrated the stability of the TxD interaction 42 . There were also strong interaction energies at additional positions along the length of the cage edge . This led us to investigate our molecular model at these positions , as discussed in the following sections . Leg to leg interactions . Our analysis of interaction energy indicated several interaction ‘hotspots’ along the length of the assembled legs ( Fig . 3 ) . Of these , two are close to point mutations in the human clathrin gene that have been identified in patients with autosomal dominant mental retardation - 56 ( MRD56 ) ( refs . 43 , 44 ) . These muta - tions , P890L and L1074P , fall close to interaction hotspots formed between residues 883 – 888 and 981 – 984 of the distal domain and between distal and proximal domain residues 1 , 040 – 1 , 046 and 1 , 428 – 1 , 433 ( Fig . 3c , Supplementary Fig . 2 and Supplementary Terminal Ankle Distal Knee Proximal TxD 1 a b c d 330 838 1 , 074 1 , 198 1 , 576 1 , 675 395CHCR0 543CHCR1 692CHCR2 839CHCR3 985CHCR4 1 , 134CHCR5 1 , 280CHCR6 1 , 429CHCR7 1 , 576TxD Heavy chain repeat ( CHCR no . ) Distal Proximal TxD LC 60° 1 227 LC proximal LC TxD2 LC TxD1 0 . 00 0 . 20 0 . 40 0 . 60 0 . 80 1 . 00 0 . 000 0 . 025 0 . 050 0 . 075 0 . 100 0 . 125 0 . 150 0 . 175 0 . 200 0 . 225 0 . 250 0 . 275 0 . 300 F ou r i e r s he ll c o rr e l a t i on Resolution ( 1 / Å ) / 28 Mini coat / 32 Sweet potato / 36 Barrel / 36 Tennis ball / 37 Big apple Structure / substructure / All hubs HCR6i HCR6g HCR6e HCR7a HCR7c HCR6c Fig . 2 | the consensus hub substructure from all and individual clathrin cage architectures . a , The domain structure of the clathrin heavy ( including TxD1 and TxD2 ) and light chains ( including LC TxD1 and LC TxD2 ) . b , The consensus hub structure resulting from subparticle refinement of all cage types , at 4 . 7 Å resolution .

This emphasizes the importance of such stabilizing inter - actions for the cellular function of clathrin . A number of studies have highlighted the potential significance of histidines in clathrin assembly , which is pH dependent in vitro 45 – 47 . In our consensus hub structure , the only histidines involved in potential intermolecular contacts are 1 , 279 and 1 , 432 , which are close to asparagine 853 and glutamate 1 , 042 respectively on neighboring heavy chain legs , and have favorable interaction energies in our Rosetta analysis . This does not rule out the possibility that other histidines 46 , not identi - fied in our structure as forming stabilizing interactions , contribute to clathrin cage assembly via alternative mechanisms . TxD stabilization . Our model of the assembled clathrin hub reveals the interactions that stabilize key elements of the clathrin lattice , between adjacent heavy chains , at the light chain – heavy chain interface and within the TxD . In the clathrin TxD , strong interac - tions between the C termini of three heavy chains 42 determine the triskelion structure . Biochemical studies have defined residues 1 , 550 – 1 , 675 as the smallest region capable of trimerization 48 and further show that the C terminus of the light chain stabilizes trimer - ization 42 . It has also been shown previously that the respective heavy chains of the TxD form a tripod of three helices 28 with two further C - terminal light chain helices embedded in the heavy chain tripod structure 35 . Our structure reveals ( Fig . 4a , b ) that this helical tripod forms extensive coiled - coil contacts between residues 1 , 606 – 1 , 617 ( within helix TxD2 ) . Cysteines 1 , 565 , 1 , 569 and 1 , 573 have been implicated in hub assembly 49 . In our model , these residues face helix HCR7h - i 1 , 546 - 1 , 561 and align along one side of helix HCR7j 1 , 564 - 1 , 575 , which interacts with one of the light chain C - terminal helices ( LC TxD1 ) that engage the hub ( Supplementary Fig . 3a , b ) . Their role in hub assembly may , therefore , be to stabilize the helices involved in creating the interface for the energetically favored light chain - heavy chain interaction ( Fig . 3b and Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . Light chain association at the proximal and TxD . Our struc - ture reveals in detail how the light chain associates with the heavy chain and how the light chain C - terminal helices engage with the heavy chain TxD . Light chains of 23 – 26 kDa are tightly associated with heavy chains , requiring strong chemical denaturants such as sodium thiocyanate to remove them 50 . They have been implicated in the timing and productivity of vesicle formation 51 , in the regula - tion of GPCR endocytosis 52 , clathrin disassembly 53 , and the nega - tive regulation of the association of huntingtin interacting proteins ( HIP1 and HIP1R ) with actin 54 , 55 .

In our map , this proximal binding light chain helix is well - resolved , enabling fit - ting of the continuous density from residues 99 to 157 , spanning 11 helical repeats of the heavy chain proximal domain from HCR6b to HCR7f ( Fig . 4c ) . The sequence register of this area of our map and model also agrees closely with the X - ray structure of residues 1 , 210 – 1 , 517 ( ref . 34 ) of the proximal domain ( Supplementary Fig . 1e ) . Our model explains yeast two - hybrid studies 41 that have previously demonstrated the importance of Trp 105 and Trp 127 for light chain binding and their stabilizing role is highlighted by energetic analysis ( Fig . 3 ) . In our model , Trp 105 forms an aromatic stacking interac - tion with Phe 1 , 327 and Phe 1 , 296 ( Fig . 4c ) . Mutation of Trp 105 to arginine abolishes light chain - heavy chain binding but it is rescued by the mutation of lysine to glutamate at 1 , 326 41 . We show that LC Trp 127 binds in a hydrophobic pocket between HCR6h and HCR6i created by Phe 1 , 410 , Phe 1 , 414 and Trp 1 , 386 , further adjacent to Lys 1 , 415 ( Fig . 4c ) . In the yeast two - hybrid study , binding was lost on the mutation of Trp 127 to arginine but rescued by mutation of Lys 1 , 415 to glutamate 41 . We modeled the mutations resulting from yeast two - hybrid studies , using the most common rotamers . In each case , the rescue mutation forms a plausible salt bridge with the origi - nally disruptive mutation , with the charged groups for the pairs Arg 105 / Glu 1 , 326 and Arg 127 / Glu 1 , 415 within 3 Å of one another ( Supplementary Fig . 3c , d ) . Between residues 158 and 189 , the light chain becomes disordered before rebinding at the TxD in a helix - loop - helix arrangement . The further two helices ( LC TxD1 and TxD2 ) in the helix - loop - helix arrangement stably associate with two heavy chain TxD domains in trans , bridging adjacent legs that join to make the triskelion vertex ( Fig . 4c and Supplementary Fig . 3a ) .

To find out how triskelion legs adapt to form varying cage archi - tectures , we locally fitted triskelion leg segments from our con - sensus hub structure into the whole cage maps determined in this study . Three cages , the 28 mini coat , 36 barrel and 36 tennis ball ( Fig . 5 ) were at sufficient resolution to allow docking of the segments 1 , 629 – 1 , 281 , 1 , 280 – 1 , 131 , 1 , 130 – 840 and 839 – 635 for each leg . The independent local fitting of each cage type provides an unbiased view of the variable leg conformations and angles across three different cage types ( Supplementary Movies 2 and 3 ) . We found across cage types , as expected , that there were variable leg conformations ( Supplementary Fig . 4a ) . These were charac - terized by consistent angular differences of ~ 18° in the proximal to distal joint region , ~ 12° in the distal to ankle region , and more substantial angular variation of 7 – 17° between the distal joint and distal domain . We note that the heavy chain helices from the N terminus to residue 965 are twisted relative to previously published 28 ɑ - carbon models ( Supplementary Fig . 4b , c ) . This indicates that a different ankle - distal surface is presented to the inside of the cage , which may have implications for understanding adapter protein binding . It might be expected that the distribution of the leg angles would correlate with the local cage geometry to which a leg contributes , for instance , whether a leg segment associates with a hexagon or a pentagon . To address this question , we assigned each leg a geo - metric signature describing its local geometric context within the cage architecture and plotted the leg angles for each individual conformation ( Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . We found that legs related by symmetry in the mini coat and barrel cages had , as expected , comparable conformations . However , where some legs shared the same geometric signature but were not related by global symmetry , as frequently found in the tennis ball , this was not the case . This shows that legs can fit within a particular geometric context with a variety of conformations and suggests that individual leg conforma - tions may result from longer range influences from other legs more than simply the local geometric environment . Conserved interaction patterns between cage types . To exam - ine how universal the leg - leg contacts were in the formation of different clathrin structures we determined contact maps for the complete cage maps of the mini coat , hexagonal barrel and ten - nis ball structures based on the individual fitting of triskelion legs into these maps discussed above ( Fig . 5 ) . The envelope provided by the lower resolution whole cage maps provides information on the path of a particular triskelion leg , which we observed to vary in whole cages . Such changes in the path of a leg might be presumed to result in differences in the contacts made between legs in a whole cage in comparison to the consensus hub structure . To investigate this , we determined contact maps reporting contact pairs between ɑ - carbons on different chains that were within 6 Å resolution of one another for individual legs within whole cage models . At the resolutions of the whole cage maps ( Supplementary Table 1 ) , we do not expect to be able to define precise molecular contacts , however , changes in the pattern of intermolecular contacts could indicate broader changes in the interaction between legs in whole cages . Interestingly , we see no obvious qualitative change in the pattern of these contacts across cage types nor in comparison to the consensus hub structure contact map ( Fig . 5 ) . Thus , while angular changes , which may result from small movements within the hub and leg conformation ( Supplementary Figs . 4 and 5 ) , enable a leg to adapt to different cage geometries , they do not significantly alter the pat - tern of intermolecular contacts that are formed . We do note intrigu - ing differences in the distributions of contacts between heavy chain legs of different geometries ( Supplementary Fig . 6 ) but higher reso - lution structures of these whole cages would be required for fur - ther interpretation .

Discussion Our map and molecular model for assembled clathrin in combina - tion with analysis of five distinct cage architectures provide insights into the assembly mechanism of clathrin coats . The pattern of inter - actions we observe , combined with a limited range of leg confor - mations , suggests that gentle flexing of the legs between established contact points allows clathrin to adapt its conformation to form the architecture required to support membrane and adapter dynamics , without the requirement for new contacts specific to a particular cage architecture . This extends previous observations on the con - tribution of variations in leg conformation to the hexagonal barrel cage structure 27 , 28 , 57 . The series of interaction points that we have identified at intervals along the clathrin legs suggests the strength of the leg - leg interaction would depend on the degree of alignment of these multiple binding sites . Thus , we can speculate that where binding sites are aligned this would result in a stable lattice , which may nonetheless be easily destabilized by factors that alter that alignment . This scenario is consistent with the rapid exchange of triskelia observed during clathrin - coated vesicle formation 4 , 5 , 58 . Our data thus reveal a universal mode of clathrin assembly that supports its role in rapidly changing and morphologically varied cellular coat structures . For the rapid exchange of triskelia to take place , clathrin - adapter interactions must also be considered . Clathrin is recruited to the growing coated vesicle at the plasma membrane by adapter proteins , primarily AP - 2 , which , through specific binding to recep - tor internalization motifs , enables selection of cargo for inclusion in the vesicle . AP - 2 recruits further adapter proteins through its appendage domains , which can bring additional cargo to the vesi - cle 59 or influence the size or shape of the resulting coated vesicle 60 , 61 . Aguet et al . 61 showed that removing the α− appendage domain from AP - 2 resulted in clathrin - coated structures that lacked curvature suggesting that , in cells , the interaction between AP - 2 and certain adapter proteins is required to generate a curved clathrin lattice . This contrasts with experiments in vitro 62 in which clathrin polym - erization on liposomes incubated with a clathrin - binding epsin domain drove membrane curvature sufficiently to form clathrin - coated buds . This highlights the fine balance of competing inter - actions involved in coated vesicle formation . In allowing diverse cage architectures to be formed using relatively small changes in leg conformation and common sites of interaction , the structure of clathrin presents a neutral framework amenable to adaptation by changing conditions . The cage architectures examined in this study are relatively small compared to many of the structures likely to occur in cells . However , along with other larger ( less symmetrical ) cage arrangements , the tennis ball structure has been observed to enclose a membrane in purified coated vesicles 63 . Since the hub structure does not signifi - cantly vary across cage architecture , it seems possible that the inter - action patterns observed in this study are relevant for other cage types formed from pentagons and hexagons . Whether these inter - actions are universal for other types of clathrin lattice , for example , flat 3 or cylindrical lattices 56 or coats with heptagonal 3 , 63 or square faces 64 , remains to be determined . online content Any methods , additional references , Nature Research reporting summaries , source data , statements of code and data availability and associated accession codes are available at https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41594 - 019 - 0292 - 0 .

Endogenous clathrin - coated vesicles were extracted from the brains of Sus scrofa and clathrin was purified from them as triskelia using previously described methods 65 . The initial assembly for harvesting cages was performed by dialysis into polymerization buffer pH 6 . 2 and subsequent ultracentrifugation with concentration by resuspension of the pellet into a small volume of polymerization buffer . All subsequent uses of polymerization buffer used a pH of 6 . 4 . Clathrin concentration was assayed by A 280 of triskelia to avoid the effects from light scattering . The glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) β 2 - adaptin 616 - 951 plasmid was a kind gift from Steve Royle , University of Warwick 66 . β 2 - adaptin 616 - 951 was expressed as a GST fusion protein in an Escherichia coli BL21 strain and purified using glutathione resin ( GE Healthcare ) , the GST tag was subsequently removed by cleavage using a commercially available GST fusion 3C protease ( Prescission , GE Healthcare ) overnight at 4 °C in Prescission buffer . Cleavage enzyme was removed by glutathione resin and the cleaved protein collected from the flow - through after which it was concentrated and exchanged into Tris buffer on Vivaspin columns ( Sartorius ) . Complex preparation . The clathrin cage β 2 - adaptin complex was made by reconstitution in depolymerization buffer ( pH 8 . 0 ) at 4 °C , at 3 . 0 μ M clathrin with a sixfold molar excess of β 2 - adaptin and dialysis overnight into polymerization buffer at pH 6 . 4 . Clathrin - β 2 cages were harvested by centrifugation at 230 , 000 g for 30 min and concentrated 10 - fold by pellet resuspension into a small volume of polymerization buffer pH 6 . 4 .

Assembled clathrin cages ( 4 μ l of 1 μ M ) were applied to a glow - discharged formvar carbon 300 - mesh copper grid ( Agar Scientific ) and allowed to adsorb for 1 min . The sample was removed by blotting and 4 μ l of 2 % w / v uranyl acetate was rapidly applied to the grid . This was incubated at room temperature for 1 min to stain the sample after which the uranyl acetate removed by blotting . Grids were air - dried at room temperature before transfer to the microscope . Samples were imaged using a JEOL 2010F FEG transmission electron microscope with a Gatan Ultrascan 2000 camera , at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV . Cryo - electron microscopy . Samples of clathrin - β 2 cages were inspected by negative stain transmission electron microscopy before freezing in vitreous ice for cryo - EM . The concentration of clathrin for cryo - EM grid preparation was between 15 – 30 μ M and determined by inspection of particle distribution in negative stain before freezing . Clathrin - β 2 cages ( 3 μ l ) were applied to glow - discharged 300 - mesh copper Quantifoil R1 . 2 / 1 . 3 grids and blotted at ambient temperature and humidity for 3 s before plunging into an ethane / propane ( 80 / 20 % ) mix liquefied and cooled by liquid nitrogen using a hand freezing device ( built by Birkbeck mechanical workshop , University of London ) . Cryo - EM micrographs were collected automatically in movie mode and acquired in four datasets using a Titan Krios ( MRC LMB ) operated at 300 kV each equipped with a Falcon II detector . Using EPU for data acquisition of each dataset , a total dose of 42 – 69 e − / Å 2 were collected over 3 s at dose rates of between 1 – 1 . 2 e − / Å 2 s − 1 and a magnified pixel ( px ) size of 1 . 705 Å / px using a 1 . 5 µ m beam and 70 µ m C2 aperture to ensure illumination of the carbon support with one image acquired per hole . Micrographs were targeted for collection between 1 . 4 – 3 . 2 μ m defocus . Cage library construction . A list was made of those cage species that are geometrically ‘probable’ conformations , according to the ‘head - to - tail dihedral angle discrepancy exclusion’ rule that has been proposed by Schein and co - workers 36 , and such that the number of vertices was less than or equal to 38 . The software CaGe 67 , 68 ( http : / / www . math . uni - bielefeld . de / ~ CaGe http : / / caagt . ugent . be / CaGe ) was used to generate a set of labeled coordinates in three dimensions and a tabulation of vertex connectivity that identifies the edges of the polyhedron . These coordinates were then manipulated in R ( ref . 69 ) so that the centroid was positioned at the origin , the fullerene’s axes of symmetry were correctly orientated for application of symmetrical averaging at a later stage ( see Data processing ) , alternate ‘handed’ versions of the ( chiral ) 32 - and 38 - vertex fullerenes were obtained by a reflection , the coordinates were scaled to give a distance between connected vertices of 185 Å ( ref . 26 ) and the coordinate set was augmented by points at a spacing of 1 Å along each edge . Hence , a library of ten species of fullerene or cage architecture were compiled . The R library ‘bio3d’ ( ref . 70 ) was used to record each coordinate set in PDB format , which was then converted to an MRC volume suitable for use as a reference for classification using the program e2pdb2mrc . py from the EMAN2 package 71 . Coordinates were converted to a volume at a low pass filtered resolution of 60 Å . Data processing . The movies were motion - corrected using MotionCor2 ( ref . 72 ) to produce motion - corrected summed micrographs , with and without dose weighting . The contrast transfer function of the micrographs was estimated from the non - dose weighted micrographs using gctf v . 1 . 06 ( ref . 73 ) using the validation and EPA functions . A total of 12 , 785 particles were manually picked from the motion - corrected micrographs using e2boxer . py from the Eman2 package . Non - dose weighted particles at a binned pixel size of 10 . 2 Å / px were extracted and subjected to reference - free two - dimensional ( 2D ) classification over 28 iterations in Relion . High - quality 2D classes were selected for further classification . The selected subset of particles contained 9 , 500 particles and was used in a supervised asymmetric three - dimensional ( 3D ) classification into ten structural classes ( see Cage library construction sections ) . The big apple reference contained 38 triskelia , however , the resulting 3D classification volume contained only 37 triskelia indicative of the robustness against reference bias in this particular analysis . The volumes from the classification and associated particles were used for subsequent classification and refinement . Reconstructions with and without imposing symmetry were found to correlate , further indicating a lack of reference and symmetry bias . Further image processing was performed using Relion - 2 . 1 ( ref . 74 ) . Phase flipped particles were extracted from the dose weighted micrographs . The extracted box size was 500 px at a pixel size of 1 . 705 Å to include cages up to a size of 850 Å . Each cage architecture was refined unbinned without imposing symmetry ( Table 1 ) from the supervised 3D classification subsets and volumes low pass filtered to 40 Å . A mask was generated from the C 1 reconstruction at 3 σ , extended and softened by 4 and 9 px . This mask was used to refine the respective structures imposing symmetry whilst employing solvent flattening and a Gaussian noise background . The resolutions of each reconstruction were estimated using the gold - standard Fourier shell correlation ( FSC ) measurement within a mask created from the refinement volume at a contour level of 3 σ , expanded by 4 px and softened by 9 px ( 3 σ / e4 / s9 ) . The MTF of the Falcon II camera operated at 300 keV was applied and the B factor of the map automatically calculated when the resolution exceeded 10 Å ( ref . 75 ) . The resolution of each reconstruction was found to correlate with the number of asymmetric units used in the refinement ( Supplementary Note 1d ) . Further unsupervised 3D classification of each structure was performed into three classes with a regularization parameter T of 4 , no imposed symmetry and no mask to ensure no reference bias was present in the particle subsets ( Supplementary Note 2 ) . Localized subparticle extraction and reconstruction . Relion localized reconstruction python scripts 37 and in - house written scripts were used to extract trimerization hub subparticles from the whole cage particles . The hub subparticles were then refined and reconstructed independently to obtain the highest resolution hub structure . This is described in detail in the Supplementary Methods . A structure of the hub containing residues 581 – 1 , 180 , 700 – 1 , 550 and 1 , 100 – 1 , 630 was generated from 3IYV and fitted into the hub of the 9 . 1 Å 28 mini coat volume . This model was fitted at each of the hub vertexes of each cage and used to define a vector in UCSF Chimera describing the location of the hub in the respective C 1 whole cage reconstruction . The hubs were extracted and recentred as new subparticles in 256 px boxes . The subparticles were extracted from whole cage particles boxed in at 750 px at 1 . 705 Å without phase flipping to include all signal delocalized due to the defocus 75 applied during data collection . This was repeated for each cage architecture and , thus , in each case , the subparticle extraction expanded each whole cage dataset to n times the original particle number , where n is equal to the number of hubs in the respective cage architecture . Reconstructions of the newly extracted hub subparticles were made to serve as references for refinements . Refinements were first conducted in C 1 without masking , and further refinements made using C 3 symmetry , masking applied from a 3 σ extended 4 px and softened 9 px mask ( 3 σ / e6 / s9 ) , with solvent flattening and a Gaussian noise background . Due to the special case where protein density extends outside of the refinement mask and box , for the hub subparticles it was necessary to apply a soft spherical mask ( 320 Å diameter , 10 Å softened ) to the unfiltered half maps before resolution estimation , to remove protein density outside the sphere of refinement . A gold - standard resolution estimation of each hub subparticle then followed and the reconstructions were estimated to be a resolution between 5 . 1 and 7 . 8 Å . Each hub subparticle particle set was combined to create a consensus refinement of the hub structure in every cage architecture that had been determined . This structure was refined as previously described and the map used for subsequent final model building and optimization ( see model building ) . Global resolution was measured as described by gold - standard FSC ( 3 σ / e6 / s11 ) and found the reconstruction to have converged at a resolution of 4 . 7 Å , with a measured map B factor of − 165 Å 2 . Local resolution estimations were made using Relion revealing resolutions extending to 4 . 3 Å in the areas that were modeled . Protocol for localized subparticle extraction and reconstruction . The invariant hub structures at the vertices of all cage types present an opportunity for symmetry averaging . However , the formal symmetry of these cages does not describe the NAtuRE StRuCtuRAL & MoLECuLAR BIoLogY | www . nature . com / nsmb Articles NATurE STruCTurAl & MolECulAr Biology location of every hub due to the presence of additional local symmetry and potentially cage deformation . We used localized reconstruction 37 as described in the previous section to identify the locations of all repeating hub subunits within each cage structure . A generalized protocol for this is shown as follows , also describing the additional steps ( 7 – 10 ) should partial signal subtraction be employed : ( 1 ) Complete C 1 refinement of whole cage complex . ( 2 ) Generate and fit a hub PDB to the repeating subparticle of the whole complex . ( 3 ) Use localrec _ create _ cmm . sh to create a vector defining the origin of the map and the center of mass of each PDB fitted to the subparticle . ( 4 ) Use localrec _ create _ subparticles . sh and relion _ localized _ reconstruction . py to localize the position of the subparticle in the C 1 reconstruction and , by refer - ence to the Relion star file , the subparticle in each original particle image . Subparticles will be reboxed and extracted with new origins . ( 5 ) Use localrec _ create _ substructures . sh and relion _ localized _ reconstruction . py to reconstruct the substructure volume representing each subparticle . ( 6 ) Join all subparticle star files to process in 2D / 3D classification , and 3D refinement . ( 7 ) Use localrec _ create _ subtration _ masks . sh to generate softened volumes minus the subparticle of interest for partial signal subtraction . ( 8 ) Use localrec _ create _ subparticles . sh to generate the same localized subparti - cles with and without signal subtraction . ( 9 ) Use localrec _ create _ substructures . sh to reconstruct the substructure volume representing each partial signal subtracted subparticle ( 10 ) Join all star files for the partially signal subtracted subparticles and process in 2D and 3D classification , and refinement . Model building . Density for bulky side chains was visible , and comparison of the relevant map density to an X - ray structure of residues 1 , 210 – 1 , 517 of the proximal domain showed a good agreement in residue register 34 . The crystal structure of the proximal clathrin heavy chain ( 1B89 ) fitted to the hub substructure was thus used to obtain the initial register of the map . The remaining helices were built as ideal polyalanine helices in Coot 76 . Register was assigned manually in Coot using landmark residues , secondary structure prediction and comparison to the existing C α cryo - EM model of clathrin ( 3IYV ) . Loops were initially modeled using phenix . fit _ loops . The light chain modeled as isoform B ( Accession : F1S398 _ PIG ) was assigned sequence register by landmark tryptophan residues in the proximal region ( W105 / 127 / 138 ) . The TxD associated helix - loop - helix sequence register was assigned by density consistent with the landmark tryptophan residue ( W191 ) as well as a C - terminal phenylalanine ( F200 ) . For clarity and consistency with the literature , we have referred to light chain residues using the bovine numbering . Further modeling proceeded iteratively between Coot 76 , O 77 and phenix . real _ space _ refine 78 aiming to maintain idealized geometry and sequence register . Map - to - model comparison in phenix . mtriage validated that no overfitting was present in the structures . Atomic displacement factor refinement was used to calculate the residue B factors and EMRinger used to score side chains . Model geometry was validated using MolProbity 79 . All map and model statistics are detailed in Table 1 . Interface energy analysis with BUDE and Rosetta . Interface energy analysis was performed on the cryo - EM consensus hub structure using Rosetta and the docking program BUDE . Rosetta ( v . 3 . 10 ) was used to calculate interface energy scores , reported in rosetta energy units ( REU ) using the residue _ energy _ breakdown application and the ref2015 scoring function 80 , 81 . The structure was prepared for energy scoring by minimizing the structure with the relax application 82 , 83 with all - atom constraints for five iterations and a final single iteration of backbone - only constrained relaxation . The r . m . s . deviation between the starting and relaxed structure for C ɑ positions and all atoms was 0 . 22 and 1 . 48 Å , respectively . A utility was written to sum the energy contribution of all pairwise attractive and repulsive intermolecular contacts identified by Rosetta for each residue in the consensus hub structure , which were subsequently summed over five residue windows for comparison to the analysis by BUDE . BUDE ( v . 1 . 2 . 9 ) ( refs . 39 , 40 ) was configured to report the theoretical free energy ( Δ G kJ mol − 1 ) of binding between two static input structures using the heavy _ by - atom _ 2016 - v1 . bhff forcefield . BUDE is suitable for use with a medium resolution model because it uses soft - core atoms and distance - based functions ( with 2 – 6 Å resolution range beyond the sum of the atomic radii permitted ) to describe hydrophobicity , hydrogen bonding and salt bridges and is therefore tolerant of model inaccuracies inevitable in the 4 Å resolution range . BUDE analysis was initially performed on the consensus hub structure . Then , to examine the influence of sidechain positioning , the interaction energy between pairs of sidechain residues across the interface was calculated as the average of all favorable rotamer - rotamer interactions using a customized version of BUDE . A utility was written to extract one chain from the consensus hub structure and assign the rest of the structure as the BUDE receptor . The extracted chain was split into five residue segments , at one - residue increment , and passed to BUDE as the ligand . This produced a sliding window of interaction energies along the interfaces of the clathrin structure . A good agreement in the energy scoring determined by BUDE and Rosetta is indicated by high cross correlations ( Supplementary Fig . 1c , d ) . Energy minima in the Rosetta and BUDE energy scoring data were found using a five residue sliding window and using threshold criteria rejecting minima that are below 20 % of the largest minima of the data ( Supplementary Table 4 ) . We note that BUDE successfully reports realistic energy scoring without the necessity to modify the input structure . Cage architecture model building . Molecular models for the whole cage maps were constructed in UCSF Chimera by building a complete triskelion ( 635 – 1 , 629 ) from the consensus hub structure as follows . First , the consensus hub model was fitted as a rigid body into each hub of the 28 mini coat , 36 barrel and 36 tennis ball . Each hub contains segments of nine clathrin heavy chains ( chains A , F , K : 1 , 248 – 1 , 629 ; chains B , G , L : 809 – 1 , 474 ; chains C , H , M : 635 – 1 , 075 ) and six clathrin light chains ( chains D , I , N : 99 – 225 ; chains E , J , O ) . To construct a full triskelion the common portions of each of these chains were structurally superimposed keeping the TxD - proximal 1 , 629 – 1 , 281 region fixed to maintain the invariant hub . The fit of the triskelion from 1 , 280 – 635 was then optimized by local model to map the rigid body fitting of heavy chain segments . In summary , the hub structure from 1 , 629 – 1 , 281 was maintained and three fragments , 1 , 280 – 1 , 131 , 1 , 130 – 840 and 839 – 635 , were fitted to the map . These fragments were selected manually through inspection of the density and we note that an analysis of the ɑ - carbon models of clathrin heavy chains from the previously published 36 barrel 28 reveal bend points at 1 , 281 – 1 , 130 and 837 – 840 , consistent with the choice of fragments for fitting in this study . The heavy chain modeling was repeated individually for each heavy chain in every triskelia of the 28 mini coat , 36 barrel and 36 tennis ball to produce molecular models that reflect the changing heavy chain conformations in the cages studied . Principal axes were defined through the regions 1 , 629 – 1 , 594 ( TxD ) , 1 , 550 – 1 , 280 ( proximal ) , 1 , 230 – 1 , 135 ( distal junction ) , 1 , 090 – 870 ( distal ) , 815 – 635 ( ankle ) using the UCSF Chimera . The angles between the regions were measured in every heavy chain for each cage type , using the minor principal axes . The proximal to TxD angle was found to be effectively invariant and as such only the remaining angles were plotted in python . Contact maps . Contact maps were generated using UCSF Chimera ‘Find Clashes / Contacts’ to detect ɑ - carbons in proximity of one another ( less than 6 Å resolution ) . The points on each map represent a contact between residues on separate chains . Map and model visualization . Maps and models were visualized using UCSF Chimera 84 . Reporting Summary .
