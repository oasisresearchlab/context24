An Examination of the Impact of International Student Status on Global Virtual Teams Kerri Anne Crowne Ph . D . School of Business Administration , Widener University , Chester , Pennsylvania , USA ABSTRACT Scant research exists on international student status and global virtual teams ( GVTs ) . Yet , study abroad post - COVID - 19 Pandemic is rebounding and GVTs are frequently used in class - rooms and workplaces . This article fills this literary gap through developing and testing models examining student status , per - formance , creativity , and leadership , while investigating the impact of English language ability in order to inform the inter - national business education ( IBE ) field . Specifically , the focus here is to understand how international student status affects a student’s individual performance on GVTs . Hypotheses were generated that English language ability would moderate the relationship between international student status and creativity , as well as international student status and leadership . Results showed support , although weak , for these hypotheses . However , the most significant finding was the direct impact of English language ability on the dependent variables . Furthermore , an important contribution here is evidence that international students provide creativity and leadership on teams as long as their language ability is perceived to be good . Instructors may use these findings to design mechanisms to aid cross - cultural teams to work more effectively by providing a better understand how English language ability may influence the team and control for this ability when including peer eva - luations scores in grades . KEYWORDS Creativity ; English language proficiency ; global virtual teams ; international students ; performance ; study abroad Much research has focused on global virtual teams ( GVT ) as a result of the X - Culture project ( see https : / / x - culture . org / for - researchers / publications - etc / ) ( X - Culture 2023 ) . Yet , there are still areas to investigate in international business education ( IBE ) . This article examines the underexplored area of international students’ impact on GVTs . To answer the question : Research Question : Does international student status affect a student’s individual perfor - mance on GVTs ? International students are both inbound students , who visit a country for a degree , and study abroad students , who are earning credits toward their degree while in another country ( Niehaus 2018 ) . GVTs are teams where CONTACT Kerri Anne Crowne kabrannen @ widener . edu School of Business Administration , Widener University , PA , Chester , USA JOURNAL OF TEACHING IN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS 2023 , VOL . 34 , NO . 3 , 66 – 91 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1080 / 08975930 . 2023 . 2234643 © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group , LLC individuals use technology to communicate across national and geographic areas ( Li et al . 2017 ; Paul et al . 2004 ) . While some research has examined nationality and peer evaluation of performance on GVT ( Tavoletti et al . 2022 ) and others have examined culture and peer evaluation of perfor - mance on GVTs ( Crowne 2020 ) , to date , no research has examined the impact of international student status on individual performance on GVTs . This lack of scholarly research in this area is problematic . First , GVTs , are being used in educational settings ( Ndubuisi et al . 2022 ; Rauer et al . 2021 ) , where they are found to increase international business learning and cul - tural understanding ( Gonzalez - Perez et al . 2014 ) , as well as contribute to positive changes in behavior ( Taras et al . 2013 ) . Moreover , they are more frequently being used in the workplace ( Iskhakova and Ott 2020 ; Li et al . 2017 ) . Second , because over 5 million students studied abroad in 2017 ( Education : Outbound internationally mobile students by host region 2018 ) ; thus , making interantionl students a substantial portion of the higher education population . While the pandemic canceled many study abroad programs ( Carrasco 2022 ; Peralta , Díaz , and Díaz 2021 ) , some schools are seeing numbers rebounding ( Carrasco 2022 ) . Third , the inter - national student population in higher education deserve attention since many higher education institutions seek globally and culturally skilled students ( Rosch and Haber - Curran 2013 ) . Fourth , international educational environments are important for accreditation ( Avolio and Benzaquen 2020 ) and in - depth cultural emersions programs are important form of business school internationalization ( Blasco 2009 ; Klarin et al . 2021 ) . Thus , provid - ing evidence to advocate these programs to those in higher education . It would seem plausible that individuals who are exposed to multiple cultures as an international student may have developed skills that would allow them to perform better in cross - cultural interactions , such as GVTs ; however , this relationship has not been tested . Thus , this article aims to fill a gap in this research area . To investigate the research question posed , models were developed based on the literature . Hypotheses were created and tested . The first model , while simplistic , analyzes international student status on performance , and provides the foundation for the second model . The second model examines the rela - tionship of study abroad on creativity and leadership , while also examining how English language ability impacts the proposed relationships . These mod - els are developed separately because the performance measure included con - sideration of creativity , leadership , and English language ability . The unique contribution and value of this study is the evidence it provides of the impact of student status on individuals’ performance , creativity , and leadership on GVTs , while also showing how English language ability influences these variables . From a review of the literature , it does not appear that these relationships have been previously tested . JOURNAL OF TEACHING IN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS 67 2 . Literature review 2 . 1 . International students , individual performance , and GVTs Inherently , GVTs include two or more cultures , which contribute to cultural challenges . Cultures are multifaceted ( Hofstede 1994 ; Hofstede , Hofstede , and Minkov 2010 ; Trompenaars and Hampden - Turner 1998 ) and include shared and accepted symbols , rituals , norms , attitudes , and behaviors of a group ( Hofstede 1991 ) . They shape cultural members’ thoughts ( O’Grady and Lane 1996 ) and actions ( O’Grady and Lane 1996 ; Shim and Paprock 2002 ) . Therefore , a GVTs members’ thoughts and actions are guided by their culture , which is likely different from those of other cultures . Evidence suggests cultural differences can create challenges ( Gavidia , Mogollón , and Baena 2004 ) and are frequently apparent in teams ( Gibson and Zellmer - Bruhn 2002 ; Lin Siew , Kuan Khye Ling , and Chang Kuan 2022 ) . Furthermore , GVTs find knowledge sharing difficult ( Eisenberg and Mattarelli 2017 ) . However , study abroad is a form of national cultural exposure , which are experiences related to a geographic area that allow someone to develop cultural awareness ( Crowne 2013 ; Haas 2018 ; Wickline et al . 2020 ) . It is considered a valuable learning experience ( Haas 2018 ; Wickline et al . 2020 ) . An international study experience should help students be more effective on GVTs , since exposure multiple cultures likely broadens a student’s perspective . Course evaluations related to short - term study abroad experience supports this point indicating students identified many non - academic benefits from the experience , including developing independence , self - confidence , self - reliance , and stronger interpersonal skills ( Harrison and Palmer 2019 ) . All these ben - efits should contribute to better performance . Higher cultural intelligence ( CQ ) , the ability to be flexible and adapt to diverse cultural situations ( Ang , Van Dyne , and Koh 2006 ; Earley and Ang 2003 ) , was found in individuals who were abroad for education or work rather than for other purposes ( Crowne 2008 ) . Increased CQ levels was also found in individuals who participated service - abroad program ( Pless , Maak , and Stahl 2011 ) even when the service project where short - term ( Engle and Crowne 2014 ) . Others found that higher CQ levels were also found in expatriates versus non - expatriates ( Sousa and Gonçalvesab 2017 ) . Additionally , indivi - duals working on GVTs who had higher CQ had better quality deliverables ( Li et al . 2017 ) . Another study found an individual’s motivational cultural intelli - gence ( MCQ ) , a subset of CQ that involves one’s desire to learn and function in different cultures , increased after studying abroad ( Peng , Van Dyne , and Oh 2015 ) . This desire to learn about other cultures should positively influence variables such as performance , because students want to learn about others’ cultures . Also , it helps students become more sensitive to new and different cultures ( Wright and Clarke 2010 ) . Alumni of study abroad programs indi - cated the experience contributed to an increased work ethic ( Hubbard and 68 K . CROWNE Rexeisen 2020 ) , which should lead to better performance . While here CQ was not examine for this study , it is likely that higher levels of CQ are found in international students and they are eager to learn about other cultures . Furthermore , one study found that at the team level , teams formed of indivi - duals with GVT project experience produced better quality results than teams of individuals who had not previously been on a GVT project ( Taras et al . 2013 ) . Thus , it is likely ( see Figure 1 ) : Hypothesis 1 : On GVTs , international students will have better individual performance than domestic students . To delve further into the relationship of international student status and GVTs , two other outcome variables were examined – creativity and leadership . Furthermore , English language ability was analyzed . This second analysis occurred because these variables contributed to overall performance ; thus , they could not be included in the first analysis . 2 . 2 . Study abroad and creativity Scholars note creativity in projects includes novel ideas , solutions , and other project aspects which were considered appropriate and useful in meeting the team’s objectives ( Suh and Badrinarayanan 2014 ) . Often divergent thinking , original and alternative responses to the problems , is used interchangeably with creativity ( Karatas and Aktan - Erciyes 2022 ) . It is critical in problem solving and a source of competitive advantage ( Devanna and Tichy 1990 ; Rosa , Qualls , and Fuentes 2008 ; Suh and Badrinarayanan 2014 ) , as well as a crucial economic resource of the 21 st Century ( Kaufman and Beghetto 2009 ) . Student creativity is considered important in business programs because of the dynamic international workplace ( Riordan , Sullivan , and Fink 2003 ) and organizational expectations that college graduates exhibit them ( Glassman and Opengart 2016 ) . Limited research exists on international student’s individual creativity ; however , some past studies found living in other cultures improved creative abilities ( Gurman 1989 ; Maddux and Galinsky 2007 ) . Additionally , research - ers found more creative problem - solving strategies ( Lambert , Tucker , and d’Anglejan 1973 ) , advantages in tasks involving creative problem solving ( Cushen and Wiley 2011 ) , and more creative functioning ( Karatas and Aktan - Erciyes 2022 ) in that bilingual students . Moreover , bilingualism was found to be a positive influence on divergent thinking ( Leikin , Tovli , and Woldo 2020 ) and positively correlated with cognitive flexibility and openness to experience ( Chen , He , and Fan 2022 ) . International students are probably bi - or multi - lingual , thus they would likely have more creative abilities .

CROWNE Previous research associated openness to experience with study abroad participation ( Bakalis and Joiner 2004 ; Goldstein 2019 ; Niehoff , Petersdotter , and Freund 2017 ) . Students with high openness to experi - ence have shown more creativity ( Zhang , Rasheed , and Luqman 2020 ) and innovative work behaviors ( Javed et al . 2020 ) . Moreover , CQ was found to positively impact one’s creativity ( Yunlu , Clapp - Smith , and Shaffer 2017 ) and influenced cultural learning , which had a positive effect on creativity ( Xiao - Jun and Xiao - Ping 2017 ) . Furthermore , at the team level , it was found that GVTs that had team charters and were nationally diverse developed more creative outputs ( Johnson et al . 2022 ) . Therefore , while scant research associates international students to increased creativity , it seems likely those with these experiences will be more creative on GVTs due to their possible openness to experience , bilingual skills , and higher CQ . Thus : Hypothesis 2 : On GVTs , international students will have higher levels of creativity than domestic students . 2 . 3 . International students , leadership , and GVTs Openness to experience , an important leadership trait ( Samardžija , Walker , and Bazdan 2017 ) , has been associated with study abroad participation ( Bakalis and Joiner 2004 ; Goldstein 2019 ; Niehoff , Petersdotter , and Freund 2017 ) . Additionally , the trait was positively associated with effective leadership ( Cirtautienė and Endriulaitienė 2018 ) and transformational leadership ( Lopez - Perry 2020 ) . This result may be because scholars believe study abroad provides opportunities for students to develop effective global leadership skills ( Niehaus 2018 ) . Being an effective global leader has been associated with environmental adaptability ( Cirtautienė and Endriulaitienė 2018 ) , likely a skill of international students because they choose to study in a foreign country where they may need to adjust their behaviors . Moreover , study abroad may influence leadership development ( Samardžija , Walker , and Bazdan 2017 ) . A study focused on short - term study abroad experiences found students developed responsible leadership competencies from their experience ( Sroufe et al . 2015 ) . Additionally , in a study of Croatian students , those who participated in study abroad pro - grams , often self - reported characteristics associated with leadership develop - ment ( Samardžija , Walker , and Bazdan 2017 ) , and study abroad showed a significant correlation with self - efficacy similar to leadership development programs ( Leupold , Lopina , and Skloot 2020 ) . JOURNAL OF TEACHING IN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS 71 Other studies examined competences related to leadership and found these competencies were strengthened during study abroad . Past research found study tour students acquired a substantial amount of CQ , a critical leadership competency ( Rockstuhl et al . 2011 ) , while also consciously adjusting their leadership behaviors to meet other’s needs ( Hermond , Vairez , and Tanner 2018 ) . Some scholars believe global leaders with high CQ will have high levels of transformational leadership ( Ramsey et al . 2017 ) . Moreover , study abroad improved student’s interpersonal skills ( DeGraaf et al . 2013 ) and communica - tion skills ( Wright and Clarke 2010 ) . Thus , international students should display leadership skills on GVTs . They are likely high on openness to experience and have developed stronger inter - personal skills , such as CQ and communication skills , which should make them strong team leaders . Therefore : Hypothesis 3 : On GVTs , international students will have higher levels of leadership than domestic students . 2 . 4 . Moderating relationship of English language ability English is the native language of over 500 million people , is spoken in over 100 countries , is the official language of many countries , and is the most com - monly studied language ( Noack and Gamio 2015 ) . It is important in business ( Fidrmuc and Fidrmuc 2016 ) and is often the lingua franca , the common language used which may not be the speakers’ native languages ( Fang and Baker 2018 ) , for business communications ( Klarin et al . 2021 ) . It is likely the common language , when working on GVTs . While some past work did not find an impact of English language ability on performance , this study look at an objective measure of language ability and not peer evaluation of the ability ( Tavoletti et al . 2022 ) . A different study found that peer evaluation of English language ability did have a significant impact on individual performance ( Crowne 2020 ) . Thus , these mixed results warrant more investigation of the impact of language ability on individual performance . Furthermore , language barriers are important to understand in teamwork ( Tenzer and Pudelko 2015 ) . Knowledge can be blocked by language differ - ences because some information can be lost when one is communicating in a non - native language ( Ford and Chan 2003 ) . Scholars also found a positive influence of shared language on the quality of shared knowledge ( Van Dijk , Hendriks , and Romo - Leroux 2016 ) . Language skills are also crucial in the transfer of knowledge ( Kivrak et al . 2014 ) . One empirical article found that Turkish students , who studied in Germany , and then re - migrated back to 72 K . CROWNE Turkey to work for a German subsidiary , helped facilitate effective knowledge transfer based , in part , on their language skills ( Verfürth 2022 ) . Furthermore , research indicates it is important for expatriates to understand English in the local context ( Abugre and Debrah 2019 ) and foreign students vocabulary is limited when they do not understand local slang ( God and Zhang 2019 ) . Therefore , the international student’s English fluency level should increase a student’s ability to communicate ideas on GVTs . This increased commu - nication and understanding by others on the team should influence interna - tional student’s ability to be creative and exhibit leadership ( see Figure 2 ) . Therefore : Hypothesis 4a : On GVTs , international student’s creativity will be moderated by the student’s English language skills , whereas students with better English language skills display higher levels of creativity than domestic students . Hypothesis 4b : On GVTs , international student’s leadership will be moderated by the student’s English language skills , whereas students with better English language skills will display higher levels of leadership than domestic students . 3 . Methodology The data was collected through online surveys administered by X - Culture , an international collaboration where thousands of individuals participate on GVTs and complete a multi - week project ( http : / / x - culture . org / , 2017 ) . Students develop various deliverables which teams were required to submit . The weekly assignments help build to the final project , which was a report on the expansion of a real company . Teams are formed by X - Culture and each team selects from 6 – 12 companies with which to work . X - Culture occurs four times during the year , two times during each of the traditional fall and spring United States’ semesters . This project is primarily completed as part of an undergraduate or graduate course . X - Culture requires the project be at least 20 % of the student’s grade in the course , but the faculty whose students are participating determines the final percentage . For this study , data collection occurred over a three - year period . While the company specific deliverables of the project are over 8 weeks , there are pre - and post - project components which extend the project to 10 weeks . 3 . 1 . Sample The sample included data from 7 , 888 undergraduate and graduate students , who were studying in over 50 countries and from nearly 150 different birth JOURNAL OF TEACHING IN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS 73 E n g li s h L a n g u a g e A b ili t y H 2 + C r e a ! v i t y I n t e r n a ! o n a l S t ud e n t S t a t u s L e a d e r s h i p H 3 + H 4 a + H 4 b + F i g u r e 2 .

The gender breakdown of the sample was even with 50 % males and females . In regards to education level , the majority of the sample was under - graduate students ( 70 . 3 % ) . The mean age of the sample was just over 23 years old . Finally , while the sample was mostly domestic students ( 81 . 3 % ) , over 1 , 400 students were international students . 3 . 2 . Measures To be classified as an international or domestic student , participants responded to two questions asking their country of birth and study . If these countries were different , a participant was classified as an inter - national student . This information was recoded as a dummy variable – No = 0 ( domestic student status ) and Yes = 1 ( international student status ) . Weekly peer evaluations occurred online for a variety of items related to the project . The Likert scale ranged from 1 to 5 for all the variables with 1 equaling poor performance and 5 equaling excellent performance . For this study , the dependent variables came from the Week 10 evaluations , which occurred post - project and were to include an evaluation of participants for the whole project . These scores were the average score a student received from each of their teammates on each dependent variable . Usually the teams were about four to six students ; therefore , three to five other students evaluated each student . For the performance variable , evaluators rated the student on the overall average of all dimensions for the project , not just Week 10 on the 1 to 5 scale noted above . The dimensions this question was referencing included commu - nication , effort , creativity , leadership , helpfulness , language ability , and work ethic . To assess creativity , evaluators rated teammates on the quality of their ideas during the project on the Likert 1 to 5 scale noted above . This measure is relevant as a proxy for creativity because novel ideas are an aspect of creativity ( Suh and Badrinarayanan 2014 ) . For leadership , the item asked the students to rate teammates on their help with coordination during the entire project , on the same 1 to 5 scale noted above . While there are many aspects of leadership , task - oriented leadership includes coordination ( Havig et al . 2011 ) ; therefore , this question was used as a proxy for leadership . The project required a minimum level of English ; however , for this study , teammates evaluated the English language proficiency of their teammates on a 1 to 5 Likert scale . This measure is relevant because the team’s perception of how well an individual communicates is more relevant than whether someone passed an English language test . Scholars note strong communication skills are important on effective teams ( Braender and Naples 2013 ) . All of these mea - sures were 1 - item survey questions . JOURNAL OF TEACHING IN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS 75 3 . 3 . Controls Age , gender , and education level were controlled in this study . The numerical age the participants inputted was used for age . For gender a dummy variable was created with male = 0 and female = 1 . For education level , the data was grouped into two categories and another dummy variable was created with undergraduate = 0 and MBA or other Masters = 1 . 3 . 4 . Data analysis Data analysis was conducted using SPSS 27 . To test the hypotheses , stepwise regression was conducted . Table 1 provides the means , standard deviations , and Pearson correlations for the sample . The table shows that international student status was positively correlated with the outcome variables . To analyze the sample further to determine if differences exist between the domestic and international students , Tables 2 – 6 were generated to exam the top countries of birth and study in the sample , just domestic students , and just international students . Table 2 shows the top countries of birth for the entire sample and Table 3 shows the top countries of study for the sample . In both tables , the United States of America ( USA ) represents the largest portion of the sample . Table 4 shows the top country of birth for the domestic only sample . Since these students are studying in the same country where they were born , it also shows the country of study . Again , USA represents the largest portion of the sample . Finally , Tables 5 and 6 displays the top country of birth and study respec - tively of only those classified as international students . China represents the top country of birth ; closely followed by Germany , and France , while USA represents the top country of study . Furthermore , the descriptive statistics for the domestic students and the international students were similar to the sample as a whole . Table 7 shows this comparison . 4 . Results To determine if the relationships posited were significant the change in the F - statistic and adjusted R - squared were examined . Additionally , the β for the hypothesized independent variables were analyzed for significance . Results for all the models generated are displayed in Table 8 . To test Hypothesis 1 , On GVTs , international students will have better individual performance than domestic students , stepwise regression was used . First , the control variables , age , gender , and education level , then in the second step , international student status was entered ( Model 1 ) . The change in the 76 K . CROWNE T a b l e 1 .

CROWNE To test Hypotheses 2 and 3 , stepwise regression analysis was again con - ducted where the controls were entered first and each outcome variable was entered individually in the second step . Model 2 tests Hypothesis 2 , On GVTs , international students will have higher levels of creativity than domestic stu - dents . It was also found to be significant when international student status was added ( change in F - statistic p < . 000 ) , and the adjusted R - squared = . 023 . Furthermore , the coefficient for international student status was significant in the model ( β = . 063 , p < . 000 ) . Again , the adjusted R - squared was low , showing weak support for the hypothesis . Hypotheses 3 , On GVTs , international students will have higher levels of leadership than domestic students , ( Model 3 ) was also found to be significant ( Change in F - statistic p < . 000 and the adjusted R - squared = . 027 ) . The coeffi - cient for international student status was also significant ( β = . 059 , p < . 000 ) . Again , showing weak support for the hypothesis since the adjusted R - squared was low . Hypotheses , H4a and H4b predicted a moderating effect of English lan - guage ability on creativity and leadership ; therefore , additional models were generated to determine if the interaction variable had an impact . The interac - tion variable was computed by standardizing international student status and English language ability , and then multiplying these standardized values . This new interaction variable was then used in the stepwise linear regression to test for moderation . The first step included the controls , the second step included international student status , the third step included English language ability , and the fourth step included English language ability and the interaction variable of English language ability and international student status . To test H4a , On GVTs , international student’s creativity will be moderated by the student’s English language skills , whereas students with better English language skills display higher levels of creativity than domestic students , the control measures were entered ( step 1 ) , then international student status ( step 2 ) , then English language ability ( step 3 ; Model 4 ) , then the interaction variable ( step 4 ; Model 5 ) . For Model 4 , which did not include the interaction variable , the change in adjusted R - squared was . 658 . The coefficient for international student status ( β = . 017 , p = . 008 ) and for English language ability ( β = . 819 , p < . 000 ) were both significant . The model was significant at p < . 000 ; thus , indicating a significant effect of adding English language ability .

CROWNE student status and English language ability , was also significant ( p < . 000 ) . The change in the adjusted R - squared from Model 4 to 5 was also significant ( p < . 000 ) . In Model 5 the coefficients for international student status ( β = . 016 , p = . 014 ) , English language ability ( β = . 820 , p < . 000 ) , and the interaction vari - able ( β = . 011 , p = . 088 ) were all significant . The interaction variable was only moderately significant ; however , the inclusion of the interaction variable reduces the effect of the international student status as the β lowers by . 001 and the p - value of the β of this variable less significant . Thus , Hypotheses 4a is weakly supported . To test H4b , On GVTs , international student’s leadership will be moderated by the student’s English language skills , whereas students with better English language skills will display higher levels of leadership than domestic students ; a similar process was used as with H4a . The control measures were entered ( step 1 ) , then international student status ( step 2 ) , then English language ability ( step 3 ; Model 6 ) , then the interaction variable ( step 4 ; Model 7 ) . For Model 6 , the change in the adjusted R - squared was . 587 . The coefficients for international student status ( β = . 015 , p = . 032 ) and for English language ability ( β = . 774 , p < . 000 ) were both significant for Model 6 which did not include the interaction variable . The model was significant at a p < . 000 ; thus , again , indicating a significant effect of adding English language . Model 7 , which included the interaction variable along with international student status and English language ability , was also significant ( p < . 000 ) . The change in the adjusted R - squared from Model 6 to 7 was also significant ( p < . 000 ) . In Model 7 , the coefficients for international student status ( β = . 014 , p = . 055 ) , English Language ability ( β = . 775 , p < . 000 ) , and the interaction variable ( β = . 013 , p = . 062 ) were all at least moderately significant . Again , the interaction variable was only moderately significant ; however , the inclusion of the interaction variable reduces the effect of the international student status as the β lowers by . 001 and the p - value of the β of this variable was less significant . Thus , Hypotheses 4b is also weakly supported . 5 . Discussion Developing a broader understanding of the impact of international students on GVTs is important because higher education institutions need to manage the diversity created by the increased mobility of students ( Pantelic , Brandstaetter , and Samuelsson 2021 ) and , in particular , it is critical to under - stand how these students function in classroom settings including GVTs . This article aimed to answer the research question , Does international student status affect a student’s individual performance on GVTs ? The findings indicate some specific benefits for international student on GVTs . While weak support for the hypotheses was found , the findings still indicate the significance of study abroad on individual outcomes on GVTs . However , the adjusted R - squared JOURNAL OF TEACHING IN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS 81 statistic was greatest when English language ability was included as an inde - pendent variable ( Models 4 and 6 ) . While it lessened the impact of study abroad on the outcome variables , it did not negate them . Thus , the impact of language skills as assessed by peers should be examined more due to its stronger , direct relationship to the outcome variables . The next sections will discuss more specifically the research implications , the practical implications for business schools and students , the study limitations , and future research . These sections will address the value of the findings of this study . 5 . 1 . Research implications This article adds to the extensive and ongoing international business educa - tion ( IBE ) ( Klarin et al . 2021 ) . It expands on the understanding GVTs , which are becoming frequently used in the classroom ( Li et al . 2017 ) , by providing evidence of the influence of international student status on these teams . This study identifies that international student status should improve team mem - bers performance , creativity , and leadership , if their English language ability is perceived to be good . This finding also expands on the lingua franca literature , which is another key are of the international business research ( Klarin et al . 2021 ) , and on research on English language ability’s impact on peer perfor - mance assessment , which were recently studied ( Crowne 2020 ) . 5 . 2 . Practical implications for business schools and students The use of GVTs is very relevant in business classrooms because organizations are increasingly using them ( Iskhakova and Ott 2020 ; Li et al . 2017 ) . Even prior to the COVID - 19 pandemic , a survey conducted by RW3 Cultural Wizard , with over 1 , 600 participants from 90 countries , found 89 % of major organization executives previously worked on GVTs ( RW3 2018 ) . As a result of the pandemic , some instructors created international experiences by using GVTs ( Rauer et al . 2021 ) and with the advances of communication technology and the minimal resources needed for GVTs , instructors likely will utilize them more in the future to provide an international perspective for students . Furthermore , GVTs are thought to be an important area of study ( Kramer , Shuffler , and Feitosa 2017 ) . The results here indicated English language proficiency assessed by testing might not be the most appropriate measure of this ability . Educational institutions should consider including multiple measures of language ability . These additional measures would aid institutions in preparing students whose native language differs from those at the institution . Then educators could provide more compre - hensive or focused language training to assist those in need . Furthermore , business programs with international students should provide training not only to students whose native language is not that of those at the institution , but also to domestic students on effective cross - cultural communicate . 82 K . CROWNE Instructors should closely examine how international students ' language ability influences team projects , especially if peer evaluation contributes to grades . Instructors could use an assessment of language ability as a control mechanism when evaluating peer performance . Therefore , minimizing the impact of language ability on the peer assessment and student grades . Finally , this study indicates that international students should be effective teammates on GVTs in school and in their future work . Thus , at a curriculum level , this study supports previous work which advocated for study abroad programs ( Hubbard and Rexeisen 2020 ) , which note organizations often seek individuals with global leadership competencies ( Walker 2018 ) . Therefore , business programs want to consider integrating more short - and long - term study abroad opportunities to build useful global skills for students to utilize in the classroom and in their future careers . 5 . 3 . Limitations and future research This study is limited , despite the interesting findings . First , international students’ international experiences were only measured as studying outside their home country – defined as a country different than their birth country . Since the measure is the country of birth , if a person moved at a young age , they may not consider their birth country their home country . Also , not captured was any past international experiences , types of experiences , or duration of international student status , since this data was not available . Furthermore , the available data did not delineate on these aspects of interna - tional status . Some students may be studying abroad for a single semester , while others may be abroad for multiple years . The length and breadth of their experience may influence how much the international experience affected the studied variables . Thus , future scholars should conduct an examination of international student status which separates students based on these factors . Another limit is the single - item measures for the dependent variables . Future researchers should use multiple - item measures for the variables exam - ined here . Additionally , the data set provided the average rating per person ; thus , individual ratings per person were pre - calculated and interrater relia - bility could not be assessed . However , the study generally included 3 – 5 evaluators per person , which including multiple evaluates for each variable . Moreover , instructors use peer evaluations frequently in coursework ( Aurand and Wakefield 2006 ) , because they are deemed an effective technique to engage students ( Dingel and Wei 2014 ; Hye - Jung and Cheolil 2012 ) and provide rewards for an individual’s effort ( Dingel and Wei 2014 ) . Thus , this form of evaluation is appropriate . For this study the Week 10 evaluations where used , and students have seen these items evaluated weekly throughout the project . The students could vocalize concerns before Week 10 , if they felt inappropriately evaluated . Anecdotally , instructors reported that when JOURNAL OF TEACHING IN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS 83 students receive unexpected scores , students have expressed concerns to instructors , which may influence final scores . The project was conducted in English ; yet , perceived language ability sig - nificantly impacted the outcome variables . IBE research should also expand more on the impact of language ability in cross - cultural studies using peer assessments , to determine what other potential student outcome variables the ability may affect . Researchers may to compare peer perception of language ability and objective language assessments to determine if differences exist . At minimum , it may be necessary to control language ability when peer assess - ments are used in cross - cultural research . Finally , scholars should investigate language ability for the most common language of the group , not just English . While the study included many countries , the overwhelming majority of students were from USA or studying in the USA . Future scholars should examine samples that do not have one dominate population or location . Furthermore , 20 % of the sample was international students and future researchers should aim for a more even split between domestic and international students . Moreover , while some past research did not find that national cultures influenced peer evaluations of performance ( Crowne 2020 ) , a recent study noted that during the COVID - 19 pandemic , individual performance of GVT members was affected by cultural value orientations through increasing self - regulation ( Schlaegel , Gunkel , and Taras 2022 ) . Thus , future research may want to examine the cultural value orientations of the home country and host country of the international student to determine if these influences individual performance on GVTs . 6 . Conclusion Does international student status affect a student’s individual performance on GVTs ? Yes , according to this study , it does . This answer is critical because international students are crucial in higher education settings . Their presence on campuses lead to more diversity and allows domestic students the opportunity to interact with those from other cultures . However , this diversity needs to be managed by instructors and administrators . Moreover , on GVTs , international students can provide a multicultural perspective which may create better team performance . International experiences are valuable for students and include being an international student and working on GVTs , yet scant research exists analyz - ing them together . Both are likely to continue to be important components to higher education . Thus , this study begins to fill the gap in the literature . Business programs and international business educators will benefit from broadening their understanding of international student status impacts stu - dent work on GVTs which will allow them to better prepare their students for the global workforce . 84 K .
