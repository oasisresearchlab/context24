By using a coarse - grained molecular dynamics model , we demonstrate that the competition between the depletion force and the active force of the motors gives rise to actin accumulation in the membrane vicinity . The resulting actomyosin structure exerts pressure on the membrane , that , due to nematic alignment of the ﬁlaments , converges to a constant for large motor active force . The results are independent of ﬁlament length and membrane curvature , indicating the universality of this phenomenon . Thus , this study proposes a novel mechanism by which the compounds of the cytoskeleton can self - organize into a higher - order structure . I . INTRODUCTION The ﬁeld of active matter has seen signiﬁcant devel - opment in recent decades . Seminal studies include the ﬁnding of the ordered state in the Vicsek model [ 1 ] , the theoretical study on Purcel’s swimmer [ 2 ] , and the ex - perimental realization of active colloids [ 3 – 5 ] . Following these , a number of studies have found that the active system can self - organize into various patterns [ 6 , 7 ] . In addition , many studies , such as the ones on suspensions of microorganisms [ 8 , 9 ] , examined the rheological prop - erties , that are aﬀected by coordinated activity . These studies suggest that the pattern formation observed in ac - tive matter systems may build a basis for complex emer - gent functions [ 10 ] . In fact , the mechanical functions of self - organized structures are of fundamental importance in biological systems . For instance , cells that exhibit spontaneous mo - tion such as migration and shape deformation [ 11 – 13 ] co - ordinate their motion to close wounds and to enable tis - sue morphogenesis [ 14 – 17 ] . In these processes , the major force - generating component in cells is cytoskeleton , such as actin ﬁlaments and microtubules [ 18 – 23 ] . These are considered composite active matter as they exhibit active dynamics through the force generated by their associated motor proteins . They form a rich variety of structures , such as the actomyosin cortex [ 24 , 25 ] , asters [ 26 – 28 ] , clusters [ 29 ] , vortices [ 30 – 32 ] , stress ﬁbers [ 33 – 37 ] , con - tractile rings [ 38 , 39 ] , polarity sorting [ 40 ] , and mitotic spindles [ 41 ] , which possess characteristic functions [ 42 – 48 ] . Among them , the actomyosin cortex is one of the most basic structures , as it maintains the cellular shape . It is a network underneath the cellular membrane , consisting of actin ﬁlaments and myosin motors as well as other as - ∗ tarama . mitsusuke @ phys . kyushu - u . ac . jp sociated proteins . Thus , to form the actomyosin cortex , these molecules ﬁrst need to accumulate in the membrane vicinity . Interestingly , such accumulation of active mat - ter under conﬁnement has been reported in recent studies using very simple models of active colloids [ 49 , 50 ] and active rods [ 51 , 52 ] . The phenomenon has been com - pared with motility - induced phase separation [ 53 , 54 ] . However , while actomyosin and active colloids show sim - ilar active dynamics , there are signiﬁcant diﬀerences be - tween these systems . Firstly , unlike active colloids , actin ﬁlaments do not self - propel unless they treadmill ( an ef - fect not considered in our study ) [ 55 ] . Secondly , actin ﬁlaments are very long compared to the typical active colloidal rods . They are ﬁlamentous molecules of about 10 nm in width and a few tens of nm to several µ m in length [ 56 ] . In addition , their persistence length is about 10 µ m , comparable to the size of a cell , which also makes them quite stiﬀ . Generally , such a long stiﬀ object expe - riences a strong depletion force when conﬁned due to the resulting restriction of its rotational degree of freedom . Therefore , in the case of these long stiﬀ objects that only becomes active when bound by the motors that produce force on them , accumulation at a conﬁning membrane is both non - trivial yet highly relevant for biological sys - tems . The purpose of this study is to investigate pattern for - mation of an actomyosin network that interacts with a conﬁning membrane and to analyze the mechanical func - tion of the resulting self - organized structure . In partic - ular , we focus on the competition between the depletion force and the motor active force . Previously , the dynam - ics of actomyosin has been studied by using a macroscopic continuum model referred to as active gel model [ 57 – 59 ] . However , in order to bridge the microscopic molecular information and macroscopic structures , we develop a mesoscopic molecular dynamics model , in a similar spirit of those in Refs [ 60 , 61 ] , in which the molecular origin of the macroscopic mechanics were analyzed . This paper is organised as follows . We ﬁrst deﬁne the a r X i v : 2 1 09 . 00841v2 [ c ond - m a t . s o f t ] 1 1 A p r 2023 2 coarse - grained molecular dynamics model of cytoskeleton in the next section , which is followed by the explanation of the simulation results in section III . Finally , Sec . IV is devoted to the summary and discussion . II . MODEL We start by deﬁning our coarse - grained molecular dy - namics model of actin ﬁlaments and myosin motors . We model a ﬁlament by a linear series of discrete particles connected by elastic springs and a motor by a particle with two heads ( Fig . 1 ) . The two motor heads can bind to two diﬀerent ﬁlaments and walk actively along them . This reproduces the motion of a bipolar motor such as the non - muscle myosin II miniﬁlaments that possess mul - tiple actin binding sites on both ends [ 62 ] . The equations of motion for the ﬁlament and motor particles are given by γ f d r f f , i dt = f f , str f , i + f f , bend f , i + f f , mot f , i + f f , memb f , i + ξ f f , i ( 1 ) γ mot d r mot m dt = (cid:88) h = 0 , 1 (cid:0) − f mot , str m , h − f mot , bend m , h (cid:1) + ξ mot m ( 2 ) Here r f f , i represents the position of the i th particle of ﬁlament f . The index f is omitted hereafter for ease of notation . r mot m is the position of the motor m , and the coordinate 0 ≤ α mot m , h ≤ 1 along the ﬁlament segment r f i – r f i + 1 gives the position of the h th head of motor m as ( 1 − α mot m , h ) r f i + α mot m , h r f i + 1 ( Fig . 1 ) . Then , the equation of motion for the motor head reads ζr f i ( i + 1 ) dα mot m , h dt = f walk , ( 3 ) where r f i ( i + 1 ) = | r f i + 1 − r f i | is the ﬁlament segment length . See Appendix A for the derivation . Inertia terms are neglected because of the small size and velocity of the molecules ; The typical sizes of the cytoskeletal ﬁlament and the motor are less than a few µ m and submicrome - ters , respectively . The sliding velocity of the motor head is submicrometers per second . Note that the ﬁlament polarity is taken into account by the order of the ﬁla - ment particle indices , which gives the cue for the motor ( a ) m e m b r a n e ﬁlament plusend minusend r f i f f , str f f , bend f f , memb motor r mot m α mot m , h f mot , str f mot , bend f walk ( b ) r f i r f i + 1 α 1 − α f mot m , h ( 1 − α ) r f i + α r f i + 1 ( 1 − α ) × f mot m , h α f mot m , h FIG . 1 . ( a ) Schematics of the coarse - grained model of ﬁl - aments and motors conﬁned by a membrane . ( b ) Sketch of the interpolation between the ﬁlament particles , on which the motor head force is assigned using the coordinate α . heads to walk actively towards the ﬁlament plus end , i . e . , in increasing index i . The ﬁlament and motor particles experience friction and ﬂuctuation from the surrounding cytosolic ﬂuid , which satisfy the ﬂuctuation - dissipation theorem ; (cid:104) ξ X i (cid:105) = 0 and (cid:104) ξ X i , a ( 0 ) ξ X j , b ( t ) (cid:105) = 2 γ X δ ij δ ab δ ( t ) with X = { f , mot } . The cytosolic friction is deﬁned us - ing a cylindrical approximation [ 63 ] as γ f = 3 πη cyto ( 3 d f + 2 (cid:96) f0 / 5 ) and γ mot = 6 πη cyto ( 3 d mot + (cid:96) mot0 / 5 ) , where η cyto is the cytosolic viscousity and d f ( d mot ) and (cid:96) f0 ( (cid:96) mot0 ) are the width and length of the ﬁlament segment ( motor ) , respectively . On the other hand , since the motor heads are bound to and walk along ﬁlaments due to the mo - tor walk force ( MWF ) f walk , they experience a sliding friction ζr f i ( i + 1 ) dα mot m , h / dt . The immobile membrane is also discretized by small particles [ 64 ] , which conﬁne the ﬁlament through the re - pulsive interaction f f , memb i = − ∂ ∂ r f i U rep ( (cid:12)(cid:12) r memb k − r f i (cid:12)(cid:12) ; (cid:15) rep , σ rep , r rep ∗ ) ( 4 ) with U rep ( r ; (cid:15) , σ , r ∗ ) = (cid:15) 1 − σ / r ∗ ( σ / r − σ / r ∗ ) H ( r ∗ − r ) . (cid:15) rep , σ rep , and r rep ∗ are the intensity , decay length , and cutoﬀ length of the repulsive interaction . r memb k is the position of the membrane particle closest to the ﬁlament particle r f i . H ( x ) is the Heaviside step function that takes the value 1 for x > 0 and 0 otherwise . The length and straightness of the ﬁlament are main - tained by the stretching and bending elasticity acting between the ﬁlament particles : f f , str i = − ∂ ∂ r f i (cid:88) i U harm ( r f i ( i + 1 ) ; κ f , str , (cid:96) f0 ) , ( 5 ) f f , bend i = − ∂ ∂ r f i (cid:88) i U bend ( r f ( i − 1 ) i , r f i ( i + 1 ) ; k f , bend ) , ( 6 ) where U harm ( r ; κ , (cid:96) 0 ) is a harmonic potential with elastic modulus κ and rest length (cid:96) 0 , and U bend ( r − , r + ; k ) = − k ˆ r − · ˆ r + is bending energy with bending rigidity k f , bend . Here , we use the abbreviations r = | r | , r f ij = r f j − r f i , and ˆ x = x / | x | . Similarly , the stretching and bending forces act be - tween the motor particles and motor heads : f mot , str m , h = − ∂ ∂ r mot m , h (cid:88) h U harm ( l mot m , h ; κ mot , str , (cid:96) mot0 / 2 ) ( 7 ) f mot , bend m , h = − ∂ ∂ r mot m , h U bend ( − l mot m , 0 , l mot m , 1 ; k mot , bend ) , ( 8 ) where l mot m , h = r mot m , h − r mot m . Their contribution to the motor heads , f mot m , h = f mot , str m , h + f mot , bend m , h , is assigned to the ﬁlament particles with the geometric weight α mot m , h , which is necessary because the binding position may be in between the ﬁlament particles ( Fig . 1b ) . Therefore , the force on the ﬁlament particle i from the motors reads f f , mot i = (cid:80) m , h ( 1 − α mot m , h ) f mot m , h − (cid:80) m , h α mot m , h f mot m , h . Here the ﬁrst and second summations are calculated over the 3 motor heads bound to the ﬁlament segments r f i – r f i + 1 and r f i − 1 – r f i , respectively . This ensures force and torque con - servation of the ﬁlament segments . Note that the counter force of the motor sliding friction and MWF , which act on the ﬁlaments , vanishes because of the force balance equation ( 3 ) . Therefore , Eqs . ( 1 ) – ( 3 ) statistically satisfy the force - and torque - free conditions , which are required for active systems including migrating cells [ 12 , 13 ] . In addition to the equations of motion ( 1 ) - ( 3 ) , we con - sider the following stochastic processes . The ﬁrst one is the process of motor binding and unbinding . Unbind - ing of a motor head occurs in three cases . Firstly , a motor head that is bound to a ﬁlament unbinds stochas - tically at the rate of ω motTO . Secondly , when a motor head reaches the end of a ﬁlament by actively walking along it , it unbinds instantaneously with the probability unity . Thirdly , a motor head unbinds with the probability unity when the other head of the motor unbinds . Here we as - sume that a motor takes either the bound state where both of the heads are bound to ﬁlaments or the free state where neither of the two heads are bound to ﬁlaments for simplicity . The free motors are assumed to diﬀuse suﬃ - ciently fast , so that they distribute uniformly . Then , a free motor binds to a randomly - selected pair of ﬁlaments whenever they ﬁnd a position on each ﬁlament that are separated by the length of the motor (cid:96) mot0 . Thus , this motor binding process alone causes no force on the sys - tem . The active force is generated in the cytoskeleton through the motor stretching and bending energies that are stored when motor heads move along ﬁlaments . The second stochastic process is ﬁlament turnover that takes place at a rate of ω fTO . The ﬁlament undergoing turnover is placed back into the system immediately at random po - sition with random orientation , and all the motors previ - ously bound to it become free . Although this model can be applied to both actin ﬁlaments and microtubules , in this paper , we focus on the system of actin ﬁlaments and myosin motors with an appropriate choice of the relevant parameters as summarized in Appendix B . We solve the set of time - evolution equations in the fol - lowing manner ; First , we calculate the turnover of the ﬁl - aments and motors , and the position of the motor head is updated by solving Eq . ( 3 ) with the Euler method . Then , Eqs . ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are solved by using the fourth - order Runge - Kutta method . In the following , energy , length , and time are rescaled by using thermal energy U 0 = k B T , motor length l 0 = (cid:96) mot0 , and motor cytosolic friction coeﬃcient t 0 = γ mot ( (cid:96) mot0 ) 2 / k B T . Finally we comment on the diﬀerence of this approach from existing models . There are several open source packages based on similar molecular dynamics models , including AFINES [ 65 ] , aLENS [ 66 ] , CyLaKS [ 67 ] , Cy - tosim [ 68 ] , and Medyan [ 69 ] . In these models , a motor is reduced to a harmonic potential with zero rest length or it is represented as a single segment with ﬁnite length since myosin motors often form miniﬁlaments . In constrast to these pre - packaged simulation approaches , a motor in our model is modeled by two segments , which connect the motor particle with the two heads . This treatment is very similar to those in Ref . [ 63 , 70 ] and allows to in - clude both the ﬁnite length of the motor and its cytosolic friction , which is mechanically more relevant to the ac - tual situation since the cytosolic friction depends on the length of the motor . III . RESULTS III . 1 . Accumulation in the membrane vicinity First , we consider actomyosin dynamics inside a cir - cular membrane . Without motors , the ﬁlaments are de - pleted near the membrane . The depletion zone is also observed when motors are introduced but no MWF is ap - plied ( Fig . 2a ) . For ﬁnite MWF , however , the ﬁlaments accumulate in the vicinity of the membrane , forming a structure that resembles the actomyosin cortex ( Fig . 2b ) . Here , the membrane curvature is set to κ = 0 . 05 , corre - sponding to a radius R = 20 ( 4 µ m ) , which is twice the ﬁlament length L f = 10 ( 2 µ m ) . To investigate whether the observed accumulation is universal or a simple consequence of the conﬁnement cur - vature , we varied the curvature of the membrane . Inter - estingly , the ﬁlament accumulation is found for planar membranes with zero curvature and even for an oppo - sitely curved circular membrane with positive curvature , in which case the ﬁlaments are present outside the mem - brane ( Figs . 2c and 2d ) . To quantify this accumulation , we calculated the den - sity distribution of ﬁlaments ( DDF ) ρ f deﬁned as a func - tion of the distance from the membrane d memb by ρ f ( d memb ) = (cid:68) 1 A ( d memb ) (cid:88) i δ i ( d memb ; d (cid:48) d ) (cid:69) t , ( 9 ) where the function δ f , i ( d memb ; d (cid:48) d ) is 1 if the ﬁlament seg - ment r f i – r f i + 1 is at the distance [ d memb − d (cid:48) d / 2 , d memb + d (cid:48) d / 2 ] from the membrane and equals 0 otherwise : δ i ( d memb ) = 1 − H ( d memb − d (cid:48) d 2 − d f i ) H ( d f i − d memb − d (cid:48) d 2 ) × H ( d memb − d (cid:48) d 2 − d f i + 1 ) H ( d f i + 1 − d memb − d (cid:48) d 2 ) . ( 10 ) A ( d memb ) is the area of the region within the distance d memb − d (cid:48) d / 2 ≤ r ≤ d memb + d (cid:48) d / 2 from the membrane , and d (cid:48) d gives the width of the average region , which we set to d (cid:48) d = (cid:96) f0 / 2 . (cid:104) x (cid:105) t represents the time average . Since the ﬁlaments can bend , we calculate the DDF using the distance of all ﬁlament particles from the membrane d f i = ( r f i − r memb k ) · n k , where n k is the normal direction to the membrane . The DDF reaches zero at the membrane and increases with d memb ( Fig . 2e ) . When MWF is absent , ρ f almost vanishes at small d memb showing a peak at larger dis - tance , which represents the fact that the ﬁlaments are 4 FIG . 2 . Snapshots of the ﬁlaments ( blue ) and motors ( red ) conﬁned by the membrane ( black ) . ( a ) A depletion zone of the ﬁlaments of length L f = 10 is observed in the absence of motors . ( b – d ) Cortex - like structure is formed around the membrane with curvature ( b ) κ = − 0 . 05 , ( c ) 0 , and ( d ) 0 . 05 . The number of ﬁlaments and motors are ( a – c ) ( N f , N m ) = ( 200 , 600 ) and ( d ) ( 600 , 600 ) . The motor walk force ( MWF ) is set to f walk = 0 in ( a ) and ≈ 2 . 4 in ( b – d ) , which gives the estimated speed of 0 . 5 µ m / sec consistent with experimental measurements . In panels ( c , d ) , thin gray lines indicate the periodic boundaries . ( e ) Density distribution of ﬁlaments ( DDF ) ρ f as a function of the distance from the membrane d memb with its ﬁrst peak position indicated by arrow heads . The cutoﬀ distance of the ﬁlament - membrane repulsive interaction is set to r ∗ = 1 . 05 . The lines correspond to the snapshots in ( a – d ) . depleted from the membrane vicinity . When MWF is switched on , however , the peak in ρ f appears closer to the membrane , as marked by the arrow heads . This indicates the ﬁlament accumulation in the membrane vicinity . At equilibrium , ﬁlaments are depleted from the mem - brane vicinity where their rotational degrees of freedom are restricted ( See Appendix C ) . This is also true when motors cross - link ﬁlaments but lack the active force gen - eration ( Fig . 2a ) . In order for ﬁlaments to accumulate in the membrane vicinity , MWF needs to overcome the depletion force . To quantify this point , we plotted the DDF peak distance , ˆ d memb , as a function of MWF . Al - though ˆ d memb also depends on the number of ﬁlaments and motors , we found that all data collapse on top of each other when the MWF is rescaled to the average MWF F walk = f walk N m / N f ( Fig . 3a ) . This indicates the uni - versality of the observed phenomena . As F walk increases , ˆ d memb shifts towards the membrane and becomes smaller than L f / 2 , at which the depletion force sets in , and thus , ˆ d memb < L f / 2 corresponds to the ﬁlament accumulation in the membrane vicinity . We deﬁne the transition point by F walk = F walk ∗ that gives ˆ d memb = L f / 2 . Note that the critical average MWF is smaller for larger membrane curvature κ ( Fig . 3c ) . Presumably this eﬀect occurs be - cause the rotational degree of freedom of the ﬁlaments increases with the membrane curvature , which weakens the depletion force ( See Fig . 7c in Appendix C ) . In ad - dition , we note that , ˆ d memb in the limit of large F walk converges to a constant value ˆ d ∞ memb , which is smaller than L f / 2 ( Fig . 3d ) . In conclusion , MWF exerted on the cytoskeleton is able to overcome the depletion force , lead - ing to a ﬁlament accumulation in the membrane vicinity that resembles the actomyosin cortex . III . 2 . Pressure One major function of the cytoskeleton is force gen - eration in the cell . Thus , we are interested in the pres - sure that the actomyosin produces on the membrane as a function of MWF and calculate it by P = (cid:68) ( A memb ) − 1 (cid:88) k (cid:16) − ∂U rep ∂ r memb k (cid:17) · n k (cid:69) t ( 11 ) where A memb is the length ( area in 3d ) of the membrane . The pressure depends on the number of motors and it scales with the number of ﬁlaments N f ( Fig . 3b ) . In fact , all the data of the scaled pressure P = P / N f col - lapse except for the intermediate F walk . Peculiarly , in the intermediate regime of F walk , the scaled pressure P takes a larger value for a smaller number of motors N m / N f , although the data of P collapses for each ra - tio N m / N f ( Fig . 3e ) . Another interesting point is that the scaled pressure converges to a constant value P ∞ for large F walk . P ∞ decreases as the membrane curvature increases ( Fig . 3f ) . This convergence means that the ac - tive force that the motors generate on the actomyosin accumulation in the membrane vicinity is not directly converted to the pressure on the membrane . III . 3 . Filament structure in the accumulation To understand the reason why the pressure on the membrane become a constant for large MWF , we investi - gate the structural order of ﬁlaments inside the accumu - lation . To this end , we measure the polar and nematic order of the ﬁlaments with respect to the membrane nor - mal direction in the membrane vicinity . The polar and nematic order parameters of the ﬁlaments in the mem - 5 0 5 10 F walk 0 5 10 ˆ d m e m b ( a ) κ = − 0 . 05 0 5 10 F walk 0 5 10 κ = 0 0 5 10 F walk 0 5 10 κ = 0 . 05 0 5 10 F walk 0 2 4 P × 1e - 3 ( b ) N f = 200 N m 200400600 N f = 400 N m 4008001200 N f = 400 N m 4008001200 0 5 10 F walk 0 2 4 × 1e - 3 N f = 200 N m 200400600 N f = 400 N m 4008001200 N f = 400 N m 4008001200 0 5 10 F walk 0 1 2 × 1e - 3 N f = 600 N m 60012001800 N f = 1000 N m 100020003000 N f = 1000 N m 100020003000 0 5 10 F walk 0 0 . 5 1 p ( g ) κ = − 0 . 05 0 5 10 F walk 0 0 . 5 1 κ = 0 0 5 10 F walk 0 0 . 5 1 κ = 0 . 05 0 5 10 F walk − π 0 π φ ( h ) 0 5 10 F walk − π 0 π 0 5 10 F walk − π 0 π 0 5 10 F walk 0 0 . 5 1 n ( i ) 0 5 10 F walk 0 0 . 5 1 0 5 10 F walk 0 0 . 5 1 0 5 10 F walk 0 π 2 π θ ( j ) N f = 200 N m 200400600 N f = 400 N m 4008001200 N f = 400 N m 4008001200 0 5 10 F walk 0 π 2 π N f = 200 N m 200400600 N f = 400 N m 4008001200 N f = 400 N m 4008001200 0 5 10 F walk 0 π 2 π N f = 600 N m 60012001800 N f = 1000 N m 100020003000 N f = 1000 N m 100020003000 - 0 . 05 0 0 . 05 κ 0 2 4 F w a l k ∗ ( c ) - 0 . 05 0 0 . 05 κ 0 2 4 ˆ d ∞ m e m b ( d ) 1 2 3 N m / N f 0 2 4 P κ = − 0 . 05 0 0 . 05 ( e ) × 1e - 3 - 0 . 05 0 0 . 05 κ 0 2 4 P ∞ ( f ) × 1e - 3 FIG . 3 .

The magnitude and direction of the polar and nematic order parameters are obtained by using the re - lationship P = p ( cos φ , sin φ ) , N = n (cid:18) cos 2 θ sin 2 θ sin 2 θ − cos 2 θ (cid:19) . ( 14 ) Firstly , the magnitude of the polar order p decreases as F walk increases ( Fig . 3g ) , with its direction perpendic - ular to the membrane φ ≈ 0 as shown in Fig . 3h . Sec - ondly , the nematic order n increases for F walk (cid:39) F walk ∗ ( Fig . 3i ) , with its direction parallel to the membrane θ ≈ π / 2 as depicted in Fig . 3j . These results indicate that the ﬁlaments approach the membrane as a result of MWF for F walk (cid:47) F walk ∗ , whereas they tend to align ne - matically parallel to the membrane for F walk (cid:39) F walk ∗ . This high nematic order of ﬁlaments aligning parallel to the membrane is the reason why ˆ d memb and P converge to constant values for large F walk since the parallel ﬁl - aments can slide along the membrane without pushing it . This also explains why P ∞ decreases as κ increases , since for larger membrane curvature the ﬁlaments ne - matically aligned parallel to the membrane have more chance to point away from the membrane ( See Fig . 7 in Appendix C ) .

F walk (cid:47) F walk ∗ are induced by the high polar order p , and thus both direction are the same ( θ ≈ φ ≈ 0 ) . III . 4 . Eﬀect of ﬁlament length In this section , we study the impact of the ﬁlament length . We performed simulations with shorter ( L f = 8 ) and longer ( L f = 13 ) ﬁlaments than those used so far ( L f = 10 ) . The results are summarized in Fig . 4 . The data collapse of both the DDF peak distance ˆ d memb and the scaled pressure P is unaltered by the ﬁlament length . In particular , the odd increase in P for smaller motor number at intermediate F walk is also observed . These results are evidence of the universality of the observed phenomena in the cytoskeleton active dynamics . For even shorter ﬁlaments , the collapse of data became worse , although the ﬁlament accumulation in the mem - brane vicinity is still observed for large MWF as shown in Fig . 5 . One possible reason is that the cytosolic friction decreases with ﬁlament length , and thus , the cytosolic ﬂuctuation increases . In all cases , however , ˆ d memb as well as P still converge to constant values ( ˆ d ∞ memb and P ∞ ) for large F walk . 0 5 10 F walk 0 5 10 ˆ d m e m b ( a ) κ = − 0 . 05 0 5 10 F walk 0 5 10 κ = 0 0 5 10 F walk 0 5 10 κ = 0 . 05 0 5 10 F walk 0 2 4 P × 1e - 3 ( b ) ( L f , N f , N m ) ( 10 , 200 , 200 ) ( 5 , 400 , 400 ) ( 4 , 500 , 500 ) ( L f , N f , N m ) ( 10 , 200 , 200 ) ( 5 , 400 , 400 ) ( 4 , 500 , 500 ) 0 5 10 F walk 0 2 4 × 1e - 3 ( L f , N f , N m ) ( 10 , 200 , 200 ) ( 5 , 400 , 400 ) ( 4 , 500 , 500 ) ( L f , N f , N m ) ( 10 , 200 , 200 ) ( 5 , 400 , 400 ) ( 4 , 500 , 500 ) 0 5 10 F walk 0 1 2 × 1e - 3 ( L f , N f , N m ) ( 10 , 600 , 600 ) ( 5 , 800 , 800 ) ( 4 , 1000 , 1000 ) ( L f , N f , N m ) ( 10 , 600 , 600 ) ( 5 , 800 , 800 ) ( 4 , 1000 , 1000 ) FIG . 5 .

Filament motion Finally , to understand how the ﬁlaments move and ac - cumulate in the membrane vicinity , we plot the time evo - lution of the polar and nematic order parameters , and the ratio of the tangential and normal speed and veloc - ity ( i . e . , signed speed ) with respect to the membrane in Fig . 6 . Starting from a uniform distribution , ﬁlaments ﬁrst form polar order in the bulk , i . e . , far from the membrane ( purple region around t (cid:46) 20 in Fig . 6a ) . This drives the ﬁlaments towards the membrane with a velocity given by the perpendicular component of the speed (cid:104) | v ⊥ | (cid:105) . At the same time , the ﬁlaments also move in the parallel di - rection to the membrane as indicated by the high value of the tangential speed (cid:104) | v (cid:107) | (cid:105) . In fact , these two com - ponents are comparable in strength ( with the tangential component slightly higher than the normal one ) , causing a diagonal motion . In contrast , the tangential compo - nent of the signed velocity almost vanishes indicating a tangential motion of the ﬁlaments in two opposing direc - tions , while the perpendicular component of the signed velocity again indicates the net ﬁlament motion towards the membrane ( blue region in Fig . 6h corresponding to the purple region in Fig . 6a ) . This motion leads to the accumulation of the ﬁlaments in the membrane vicinity . When the ﬁlaments accumulate in the membrane vicin - ity at the later stage t (cid:38) 20 , the polar order decreases and the nematic order appears . The ﬁlaments in the ac - cumulation slide along the membrane as indicated by a 7 FIG . 6 . Time evolution of ( a ) the polar order parameter p and ( b ) its angle φ , ( c ) the nematic order parameter n and ( d ) its angle θ , ( e ) the tangential (cid:104) | v (cid:107) | (cid:105) and ( f ) normal speed (cid:104) | v ⊥ | (cid:105) and ( g ) their ratio ( (cid:104) | v (cid:107) | (cid:105) − (cid:104) | v ⊥ | (cid:105) ) / ( (cid:104) | v (cid:107) | (cid:105) + (cid:104) | v ⊥ | (cid:105) | , and ( h ) the ratio ( | (cid:104) v (cid:107) (cid:105) | − | (cid:104) v ⊥ (cid:105) | ) / ( | (cid:104) v (cid:107) (cid:105) | + | (cid:104) v ⊥ (cid:105) | ) of the tangential (cid:104) v (cid:107) (cid:105) and normal velocity (cid:104) v ⊥ (cid:105) . In panel ( c ) , the boundary of the high nematic region is displayed by the gray solid line , and its time - average at the steady state ( t ≥ 40 ) is displayed by the black dotted line . The data corresponds to the case plotted in Fig . 2b . The kymographs are displayed in the region where ρ f > 0 . 01 . ﬁnite value of their tangential speed . Note the similar motion was reported for self - propelled rods [ 51 ] although the propulsion mechanism is diﬀerent from actomyosin . Since the ﬁlaments form nematic order , however , the tan - gential motion vanishes on average ( (cid:104) v (cid:107) (cid:105) ≈ 0 ) due to the existence of the counter - moving ﬁlaments . Finally , we estimate the width of the high nematic or - der region in the membrane vicinity . To this end , we measured the maximum nematic order parameter at each time after the system has reached a steady state ( for t ≥ 40 ) . The time average of the maximum nematic or - der parameter is n max ≈ 0 . 75 . We deﬁne the high nematic order region in the membrane vicinity as the region with n ≥ n max / 2 . The boundary with n = n max / 2 is displayed by the gray solid line in Fig . 6c . We estimate the width of the high nematic order region as the time - average of the boundary distance d memb . The obtained length scale is d memb ≈ 5 . 12 , which is plotted by the black dotted line in Fig . 6c . This width is approximately given by half the ﬁl - ament length b memb = L f / 2 , at which the ﬁlaments start to experience the depletion force . This agrees with the picture that the ﬁlaments are driven by the bulk polar order to accumulate in the membrane vicinity , and then exhibit a nematic order due to their interaction with the membrane . IV . DISCUSSION To summarize , we demonstrated that the competition between the depletion force and MWF leads to an accu - mulation of ﬁlaments in the membrane vicinity , which re - sembles the actomyosin cortex . The self - organized struc - ture exerts pressure on the membrane , which converges to a constant value for large MWF because of nematic alignment of the ﬁlaments parallel to the membrane . Interestingly , for intermediate MWF , the pressure in - creases when the number of motors is decreased . We highlighted the universality of the phenomenon by show - ing the data collapse of the DDF peak position and the scaled pressure ( P = P / N f ) as functions of the aver - age MWF F walk = f walk N m / N f . Qualitatively the same results are obtained for diﬀerent membrane curvatures . Moreover , the results are quantitatively unaltered by the ﬁlament length , except for very short ﬁlaments for which the pressure proﬁle changes while the structure forma - tion is still observed . Our results provide a novel insight into the self - organization of cytoskeleton active matter into higher - order structures and its emergent mechanical function . Our model is relatively simple , such that our ﬁndings can in principle be tested against experiments on artiﬁcial cells [ 71 , 72 ] . However , to our knowledge , experiments on the self - organization of actomyosin cortex in artiﬁcial cells remain challenging [ 73 ] , and oftentimes depletion agents are used instead to study the dynamics with the cortex . In comparison to the actomyosin cortex of real cells , our model omits many elements . For instance , actin nucleators and severing proteins are not included , which are thought to play a major role in the cortex forma - tion [ 74 ] . Instead , we simpliﬁed the polymerization / de - polymerization processes with a stochastic turnover . As a result , the self - organized structures tend to fade away for very large turnover rates , leading to a uniform distri - bution of actin ﬁlaments . Recent studies reported that contraction occurs due to additional passive crosslinkers between ﬁlaments with - out force generating activity [ 75 – 77 ] . This eﬀect also 8 appeared in our simulation when crosslinkers were intro - duced , but was observed at positions both close to and far away from the membrane starting form a uniform distri - bution . This contraction occurs even without the mem - brane . Therefore , to reproduce a contractile actomyosin cortex in simulation , both motors and crosslinkers need to be introduced to a ﬁlamentous network that is enriched in the membrane vicinity due to membrane - associated nucleation and biased polymerization . To maintain the localization of the contractile actomyosin cortex in the membrane vicinity , additional linkers between the ﬁla - ments and membranes are necessary . Finally , the extension of our system to three dimen - sions is important . In 3d , we expect defects to appear in the accumulation , which move dynamically . Such de - fects were previously found in the experiment using mi - crotubules [ 78 ] . Further , several studies using epithelial monolayers , another type of active system , focused on the dynamics of the defects , which causes cell exclusion and cell death due to the local stress [ 15 ] . Therefore , it would be interesting to see if the defects in the accumu - lation of actomyosin also leads to the local change in the pressure .

Appendix A : Equation of motion for motor head The position of the motor head h ( = 1 , 2 ) of motor m bound to a ﬁlament segment connecting r f i and r f i + 1 is given by r mot m , h = ( 1 − α m , h ) r f i + α m , h r f i + 1 , ( A1 ) where 0 ≤ α m , h ≤ 1 measures the relative position along the ﬁlament segment . This allows us to take into consid - eration the situation where the motor head is bound to a position in between the ﬁlament particles . Then , the time derivative of Eq . ( A1 ) consists of two terms : d r mot m , h dt = r f i ( i + 1 ) dα m , h dt + d r f f , α m , h dt . ( A2 ) The ﬁrst term represents the sliding motion of the mo - tor head along the ﬁlament segment , whereas the second term d r f α m , h dt = ( 1 − α m , h ) d r f i dt + α m , h d r f i + 1 dt ( A3 ) is the velocity of the ﬁlament at the motor head position . The latter corresponds to the transport of the motor head caused by the translation of the binding ﬁlament . Note that the left - hand side of Eq . ( A2 ) is the velocity of the motor head measured in the Lab frame . Since we assume that the heads of the bound motors are always on the ﬁlaments , we only need to consider the time evolution of α m , h to specify the position of the mo - tor heads . The motor heads experience motor stretching and bending force as well as a motor walk force ( MWF ) f mot , walk m , h . We assign the former two to the particles of the ﬁlament segments to which the motor heads bind , to keep the motor heads on them . Then , the time - evolution equation of the motor head h is given by ζ r f i ( i + 1 ) dα m , h dt = f mot , walk m , h , ( A4 ) where ζ is the sliding friction coeﬃcient between the mo - tor head and ﬁlament . The molecular motor has an ability to walk actively along the ﬁlament by consum - ing chemical energy in the form of ATP . This eﬀect is included in the model as the MWF f mot , walk m , h = ± f walk ˆ r f i ( i + 1 ) . ( A5 ) The sign speciﬁes the direction of the motion ; the plus ( minus ) sign corresponds to active walking towards the plus ( minus ) end of the ﬁlament . The direction of the motor walk is characteristic to the type of motor . In the case of the non - muscle myosin II motors that we con - sider in this study , the walking takes place towards the plus end of the actin ﬁlaments : f mot , walk m , h = f walk ˆ r f i ( i + 1 ) . Here , we make a simpliﬁcation on the process of motor head stepping forward along a ﬁlament , which is mod - elled by a constant walk force , since we are interested in the long time scale dynamics . This simpliﬁcation allows us to neglect the transient unbind of the motor head while stepping forward . Note that , since the motor heads are moving along the ﬁlament , MWF acts in the direction parallel to the ﬁlament segments . The force from the motor head on the ﬁlament is given by f mot ( r mot m , h ) = ζ r f i ( i + 1 ) dα m , h dt − f mot , walk m , h + f mot , str m , h + f mot , bend m , h . ( A6 ) 9 The ﬁrst and second terms represent the counterpart of the sliding friction force between the motor head and ﬁlament and the MWF , respectively , so that the law of action and reaction is satisﬁed . The last two terms are the motor stretching and bending force acting on the motor head h , which is assigned on the ﬁlament particles . From Eq . ( A4 ) , however , the ﬁrst two terms on the right - hand side of Eq . ( A6 ) cancel and the remainder reads f mot ( r mot m , h ) = f mot , str m , h + f mot , bend m , h . ( A7 ) Since the ﬁlament is modeled by discrete particles , this force should be split to the two edge particles ( r f i and r f i + 1 ) depending on the geometric weight α m , h as f f , mot i = ( 1 − α m , h ) f mot ( r mot m , h ) , f f , mot i + 1 = α m , h f mot ( r mot m , h ) . ( A8 ) See Fig . 1b . Note that α m , h measures the position of the motor head bound to in between the ﬁlament particles . This assignment of the force ensures the conservation of the force and torque acting on the ﬁlament segment due to f mot ( r mot m , h ) . If there is more than one motor head on the ﬁlament segment r f i – r f i + 1 , then the right hand side of Eq . ( A8 ) is summed up over them . As a result , the ﬁlament element i experiences the force from the motors given by f f , mot f , i = (cid:88) ( m , h ) ∈M i − 1 α m , h f f , mot ( r mot m , h ) + (cid:88) ( m , h ) ∈M i ( 1 − α m , h ) f f , mot ( r mot m , h ) , ( A9 ) where the ﬁrst and second summations correspond to the contribution from the motor heads on the ﬁlament seg - ments r f i − 1 – r f i and r f i – r f i + 1 , respectively . Here , M i rep - resents the list of the motor heads bound to the ﬁlament segment r f i – r f i + 1 . Appendix B : Parameter values The simulation parameters for the ﬁlaments and mo - tors are set as summarized in Table I , unless otherwise stated . Some of the parameters are compared with ex - isting experimental measurements . The bending rigidity of the motors is set to the value same as that of the ﬁlaments , since , to our knowledge , it has not been mea - sured for myosin miniﬁlaments yet . The parameters of the conﬁning membrane and system size are set as fol - lows . For the circular membrane with negative curvature , the radius is set as R = 20 , which leads to the curvature κ = − 0 . 05 . For the plane membrane with zero curva - ture κ = 0 , the distance between membranes is L x = 30 and the length of the membrane L y = 41 . 75 with peri - odic boundaries . For the circular membrane with positive curvature , in which case the ﬁlaments are present around the membrane , the radius is R = 20 , and the width and height of the simulation box is set L x = L y = 70 . 9 with periodic boundaries . This leads to the curvature κ = 0 . 05 . Appendix C : Depletion force To provide an intuitive idea of the depletion force , we show schematic sketches depicting a ﬁlament placed far from and close to the membrane in Fig . 7 . A ﬁlament placed far from the membrane can rotate freely due to thermal noise ( Fig . 7a ) , whereas the rotational degree of freedom of a ﬁlament placed close to the membrane is re - stricted ( Fig . 7b ) . This entropic penalty tries to keep the ﬁlament away from the membrane , giving rise to a deple - tion force . The threshold distance at which the ﬁlament starts to experience the depletion force is approximately given by half of the ﬁlament length d memb = L f / 2 . The cutoﬀ distance of the repulsive interaction between the membrane and ﬁlament particles lies within the threshold distance in this study . In Fig . 7c , we show the eﬀect of the membrane cur - vature on the depletion force . As the membrane curva - ture decreases , the ﬁlament rotation is more restricted . Therefore , the ﬁlaments experience a stronger depletion force for decreasing the membrane curvature . As a re - sult , in the membrane vicinity , ﬁlaments originally placed parallel to the membrane at the same distance are more likely to point away from the membrane due to ﬂuctua - tion as the membrane curvature increases .

Schematics of the rotation of a ﬁlament ( blue ) due to thermal ﬂuctuation depending on its relative position to the membrane ( black ) . Filament placed ( a ) far from and ( b ) close to the membrane . A ﬁlament placed far from membrane can rotate freely , while the rotational degree of freedom of a ﬁlament placed close to the membrane is restricted , which gives rise to a depletion force . The rotation of a ﬁlament placed parallel to the membrane is indicated by the light blue arrows . The threshold distance at which the ﬁlament starts to experience depletion force is given by half of the ﬁlament length L f / 2 . ( c ) Filament has more rotational degrees of freedom as the membrane curvature increases . The thin ash blue arrows indicate the rotation of the ﬁlaments around the membrane with κ = − 0 . 05 , and the light blue and cyan arrows represent the additional rotational degrees of freedom around the membrane with κ = 0 and κ = 0 . 05 , respectively . The dotted , solid , and dashed black lines represent the membrane with curvature κ = − 0 . 05 , 0 , and 0 . 05 , respectively . 36 ( 2018 ) . [ 18 ] J . V . Small , K . Rottner , I .

[ 55 ] Constant polymerization and de - polymerization pro - cesses cause the treadmilling of actin ﬁlaments , where they undergo translational motion . However , in our model we model these processes as a stochastic turnover , which is another simpliﬁed way often used . Nevertheless , actomyosin without actin treadmilling is still an active matter as a composite of actin ﬁlaments and myosin mo - tors because myosin motors bound to actin ﬁlaments walk along them by consuming the chemical energy of ATP , which causes active force on actomyosin .
