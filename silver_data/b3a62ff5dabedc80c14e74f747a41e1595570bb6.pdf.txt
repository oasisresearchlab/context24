Here we report a method , based on atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) with tips bearing biologically active molecules , for measuring the speciﬁc binding forces of individual adhesins and for mapping their distribution on the surface of living bacteria . First , we determined the adhesion forces between the heparin - binding haemagglutinin adhesin ( HBHA ) produced by Mycobacterium tuberculosis and heparin , used as a model sulphated glycoconjugate receptor . Both the adhesion frequency and adhesion force increased with contact time , indicating that the HBHA - heparin complex is formed via multiple intermolecular bridges . We then mapped the distribution of single HBHA molecules on the surface of living mycobacteria and found that the adhesin is not randomly distributed over the mycobacterial surface , but concentrated into nanodomains . M . tuberculosis , the worldwide leading causative agent of death owing to a single etiologic agent , adheres to epithelial cells via the HBHA , a 199 - residue protein that recognizes heparan sulphate proteoglycans ( HSPG ) . Besides the M . tuberculosis complex mem - bers 1 , 2 , other pathogenic mycobacteria , such as Mycobacterium leprae ( F . D . M . and M . C . Vidal - Pessolani , unpublished data ; http : / / genolist . pasteur / leproma ) and Mycobacterium avium also produce HBHA - related molecules 3 . Non - pathogenic mycobacteria , such as Mycobacterium smegmatis produce only distantly - related HBHA - like proteins ( F . D . M . and F . Biet , unpublished data ; http : / / www . tigr . org / tigr - scripts / CMR2 / CMRGenomes . spl ) . M . tuberculo - sis HBHA has been shown to be involved ( i ) in the mycobacterial interaction with epithelial cells , but not with professional phago - cytes 4 , 5 , and ( ii ) in the extrapulmonary dissemination of the bacilli by a mechanism that still remains to be explained 5 , 6 . The HBHA - mediated adherence relies on the interaction of its C - terminal lysine - rich domain with HSPG receptors present on the surface of its target cells 2 , 7 . Grafting of the C - terminal lysine - rich domain onto heterologous proteins has revealed that the entire adherence determinant of HBHA is located in this roughly 50 - residue region , consisting of two identical repeats exclusively composed of ala - nines , lysines and prolines 2 . The afﬁnity of this lysine - rich repeat region to model sulphated glycoconjugates , such as heparin , has been determined by surface plasmon resonance to be in the nanomolar range 2 . In the past decade , AFM 8 has emerged as a powerful tool to image biological structures at high resolution 9 – 11 and to measure the forces within or between single biomolecules 11 – 15 . In particular , functionalization of the AFM tip with ligands has allowed mapping the distribution of complementary receptors on model or cellular surfaces 16 – 20 . Here we used AFM to measure the speciﬁc interaction forces between HBHA and its receptor at the single - molecule level . We demonstrated that the HBHA - heparin adhesion forces have a bimodal distribution and increase with contact time , suggesting the interaction involves multiple intermolecular bridges . We also demonstrated that the approach can be used to map single HBHA molecules on the surface of living mycobacteria , revealing that the adhesin is localized in discrete regions of the cell surface . Virtually applicable to any microbial adhesin , the nanoscale functional imaging of living cells presented here provides new oppor - tunities for explaining cellular interaction processes at the single - molecule level . RESULTSAttaching HBHA and heparin to AFM tips and substrates To probe the HBHA - heparin interaction force , recombinant HBHA bearing a His tag at its N - terminal end ( rHBHA N - His ) 7 was attached to gold - coated AFM tips bearing Ni 2 + - nitrilotriacetate ( NTA ) groups 21 , and biotinylated heparin molecules were immo - bilized onto plane gold substrates via a sandwich layer of strepta - vidin and biotinylated bovine serum albumin ( BBSA ; Fig . 1a ) .

The morphology of both surfaces was homogeneous , smooth and stable upon repeated scanning , indicating strong attachment of HBHA and heparin to the gold surfaces . This was conﬁrmed by scanning small areas ( 1 m m (cid:1) 1 m m ) at large forces ( 10 nN ) , which resulted in the removal of the biomolecular layers and allowed us to directly determine their thickness ( 1 7 0 . 1 nm and 4 7 1 nm for HBHA and heparin - streptavidin layers , respectively ) . Measuring the interaction forces of the HBHA - heparin pair We recorded force - distance curves at a loading rate of 10 , 000 pN / s between the HBHA tip and the heparin - coated surface ( Fig . 2a ) . Adhesion forces were detected in 32 % of a total of 1 , 000 curves . The adhesion force histogram revealed a bimodal distribution with average rupture forces of 50 7 23 pN and 117 7 18 pN . The rupture length of the adhesion events ranged from 10 to 55 nm , which is consistent with the elasticity of polysaccharide chains like heparin 22 . To determine the speciﬁcity of the measured interaction , ( i ) force - distance curves between the HBHA tip and the heparin - coated surface were recorded in a 50 m g / ml heparin solution , and ( ii ) the HBHA tip was replaced by a bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) - coated tip . Both the presence of free heparin and the use of a BSA tip dramatically reduced the number of curves showing adhesion events , as well as the measured binding forces ( Fig . 2b , c ) , indicating that the adhesion forces measured using the HBHA tip are speciﬁc to the HBHA - heparin interaction . Exploring the dynamics of the HBHA - heparin interaction To investigate the dynamics of the HBHA - heparin interaction , force curves between the HBHA tip and the heparin - coated surface were recorded at various retraction rates and contact times ( Fig . 3 ) . The mean adhesion force did not substantially depend on the loading rate applied during retraction , over the experimentally accessible range ( Fig . 3a ) . This observation , in contrast to the behavior of several other receptor - ligand complexes that usually have an increase in the adhesion force with the logarithm of the loading rate 23 , 24 , indicates that the force measurements were done 0 1 2 3 4 5 – 505 – 5 0 5 H e i gh t ( n m ) H e i gh t ( n m ) Distance ( µ m ) 0 1 2 3 4 5 Distance ( µ m ) NTA - Ni 2 + N - His + + + + AFM tip HBHA SO 4 – SO 4 – SO 4 – SO 4 – SO 4 – Heparin Streptavidin BBSA Substrate Au a b c 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 68 % 50 ± 23 pN 117 ± 18 pN Piezo displacement Piezo displacement Piezo displacement F o r c e 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 91 % 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 94 % 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 Adhesion force ( pN ) 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 20 nm 2 00 p N 20 nm 20 nm 200 p N 2 0 0 p N F o r c e F o r c e F r equen cy ( % ) a b c Figure 2 | Measurement of the binding force of the HBHA - heparin complex . ( a ) Force curves and adhesion force histogram obtained in PBS between a HBHA tip and a heparin substrate . The curves are three representative examples from a total of 1 , 000 force curves obtained using independent tips and substrates . The adhesion force histogram obtained from the 1 , 000 force curves ( n ¼ 1 , 000 ) reveals a bimodal distribution of adhesion forces with maxima at 50 7 23 pN and 117 7 18 pN , as determined by a Gaussian ﬁt . As indicated by the arrow , 68 % of the curves show no adhesion . ( b ) Force curves and adhesion force histogram ( n ¼ 1 , 000 ) obtained after injection of free heparin ( 50 m g / ml ) in the solution . The dramatic reduction of adhesion frequency and broadening of the distribution reﬂect the blocking of the HBHA adhesion sites . ( c ) Force curves and histogram ( n ¼ 1 , 000 ) obtained using a BSA tip . The reduction of adhesion probability and adhesion force is attributed to the nonspeciﬁc adhesion between the BSA and heparin surfaces . All the curves were obtained using a loading rate of 10 , 000 pN / s ( both during approach and retraction ) and an interaction time of 500 ms . Similar data were obtained using more than ten different probes and independent samples . Figure 1 | Strategy for measuring the HBHA - heparin binding force at the single - molecule level using AFM .

We then varied the contact time ( few ms to 10 s ) , while keeping the loading rate during approach and retraction constant ( 10 , 000 pN / s ) . Under these conditions , the adhesion frequency ( that is , the number of curves with adhesion events ) increased exponentially with contact time and reached a plateau after 5 s ( Fig . 3b ) . This type of interaction is reminiscent of that described for the vascular endothelial cadher - in 24 involved in intercellular adhesion within endothelial barriers , except that for this protein the plateau was reached after 0 . 2 s , indicating that bond formation is much faster . We also observed that the HBHA - heparin adhesion force increased exponentially with contact time ( Fig . 3c ) . Accordingly , the dependence of adhesion frequency and adhesion force on contact time suggests that the HBHA - heparin complex is formed via multiple inter - molecular electrostatic bridges . Mapping single adhesins on living mycobacteria We used AFM to explore the surface of living Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette Gue´rin ( BCG ) immobilized on a polycarbonate membrane ( Figs . 4 and 5 ) . Topographic images revealed a smooth and homogeneous surface ( Fig . 4a , b ) , which is consistent with scanning electron microscopy observations 26 . Using a heparin tip , 1 , 024 force - distance curves were recorded across the cell surface , and the curves showed adhesion forces in about half of the cases ( Fig . 4c ) . These forces again had a bimodal distribution with mean values of 53 7 18 pN and 110 7 11 pN that matched remarkably well with the data obtained using puriﬁed HBHA immobilized on gold surface ( Fig . 2a ) . Two sets of experiments conﬁrmed the speciﬁcity of the measured interaction . First , 1 , 024 force curves recorded in the presence of free heparin showed a marked reduc - tion of adhesion frequency ( from 49 % to 4 % ; data not shown ) . Second , although a mutant M . bovis BCG strain lacking HBHA , had a smooth and homogeneous surface comparable to that of the parental strain ( data not shown ) , it did not bind the heparin tip substantially ( Fig . 4e ) . Taken together , these observations suggest that the measured binding forces are speciﬁc of the HBHA - heparin interaction , the heparin - binding region of HBHA is surface - exposed and the HBHA - heparin interaction most likely occurs through multiple intermolecular bridges . To address the HBHA distribution on the M . bovis BCG surface , spatially - resolved adhesion maps were recorded using a heparin tip over 300 nm (cid:1) 300 nm areas with a lateral resolution of 20 nm ( Figs . 4d and 5a ) . In about half of the locations , the mapping revealed adhesion events ( clear pixels ) owing to the presence of HBHA molecules , as these events were not observed in experiments with the mutant deﬁcient in HBHA production ( Figs . 4f and 5b ) . Notably , the HBHA distribution was not homogeneous , but apparently concentrated into nanodomains that may have impor - tant biological functions . DISCUSSION The results presented here demonstrate that AFM with tips bearing biologically active molecules is a powerful tool for measuring the adhesion forces that trigger cognate interactions in microbiological processes , and for mapping , at the nanometer level , functional molecules present on the surface of living bacteria . The strategy for measuring the speciﬁc HBHA - heparin interaction forces at the single - molecule level involved attaching recombinant histidine - tagged HBHA onto an AFM tip terminated with Ni 2 + - NTA and EG3 groups and binding biotinylated heparin to a gold substrate via streptavidin and BBSA layers ( Fig . 1 ) . The HBHA coupling approach offers several advantages , as it allows an optimal exposure of the C - terminal adhesive domain , confers high mobility to the attached adhesin , minimizes nonspeciﬁc protein adsorption and allows low - density coupling to ensure single - molecule recognition 13 , 21 . The bimodal distribution of the speciﬁc adhesion forces ( Fig . 2a ) reﬂects the occurrence of one and two binding events between HBHA and heparin , as has been reported for other receptor - ligand 0 25 50 75 100 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 1 , 000 10 , 000 100 , 000 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 A dhe s i on f o r c e ( p N ) A dhe s i on f o r c e ( p N ) A dhe s i on f r equen cy ( % ) Loading rate ( pN / s ) Interaction time ( s ) a b c Figure 3 | Dynamics of the HBHA - heparin interaction .

The B 50 pN binding force may correspond to the interaction strength quantum between heparin and a monomeric form of HBHA , whereas the B 117 pN force may be due either to the simultaneous interaction of two single HBHA molecules or to the binding of an HBHA dimer . Indeed , based on its amino acid sequence , the N - terminal domain of HBHA has been predicted to contain a coiled - coil region , which could potentially be involved in homotypic interactions leading to dimerization 7 . Moreover , gel ﬁltration analysis of puriﬁed HBHA indicates that the adhesin can form dimers ( F . D . M . , unpublished data ) . Our ﬁnding that the adhesion frequency and adhesion force increase with contact time ( Fig . 3b , c ) is consistent with the formation of multiple intermolecular bridges between HBHA and its receptor . As a matter of fact , the prolonged contact time required to establish strong HBHA - heparin interaction would reﬂect the time necessary for conformational changes within both molecules to allow an optimal ﬁtting between the positive charges of the HBHA heparin - binding domain and the sulphate groups of heparin 28 . This model is consistent with the fact that the HBHA afﬁnity for heparin directly correlates with the number of the lysine - rich repeats in the heparin - binding site of HBHA 2 . As the number of electrostatic bridges between HBHA and heparin modulates the strength of the complex , it suggests that , during natural infection , M . tuberculosis may exhibit broad - range epithelial adherence behaviors that could represent an adaptive trait by favoring bacterial aggregation or dissemination . Using heparin tips , we detected single HBHA molecules on the surface of living M . bovis BCG cells ( Figs . 4c , d and 5a ) . Notably , spatially - resolved adhesion maps revealed that the HBHA - mediated heparin binding activity is not randomly distributed over the mycobacterial surface , but apparently concentrated into nanodomains for which we propose the term adherosome . As HSPG - binding adhesins may induce oligomerization of their receptors upon binding 29 and the recruitment of these receptors within membrane rafts 30 , the clustering of HBHA at the mycobac - terial surface may promote adhesion to target cells . Such an hypothesis will clearly deserve further investigation . There are other exciting issues to address in future AFM research , which include assessing whether the partitioning is a speciﬁc property of HBHA or reﬂects the organization of other bacterial surface proteins , and whether the HBHA concentration at the cell pole differs from that on the rest of the bacterial surface . In conclusion , the present study demonstrates that AFM is a valuable method for exploring the interaction forces of bacterial adhesins and for assessing their distribution on the surface of living cells . This nanoscale approach offers two major advantages over existing high - resolution imaging techniques .

In future research , the use of biologically modiﬁed tips should shed new light on the molecular bases of microbial adhesion processes , and may help in the development of new drugs capable of blocking the adhesin - receptor interaction 31 . Promising applications are also expected in other ﬁelds , such as environmental microbiolgy in which , for instance , the technique should contribute to the understanding of bio - ﬁlm formation . METHODS Bacterial cultures and protein puriﬁcation . M . bovis BCG and its isogenic mutant strain deﬁcient in HBHA production 5 were grown in Sauton medium as described 1 . Escherichia coli BL21 ( pGD51 ) producing rHBHA N - His has been described else - where 7 , and the recombinant protein was puriﬁed by heparin Sepharose chromatography 1 . Preparation of HBHA tips and substrates . To attach puriﬁed rHBHA N - His onto Ni 2 + - NTA – terminated AFM tips and silicon substrates , AFM cantilevers and silicon wafers ( Siltronix ) were coated using electron beam thermal evaporation with a 5 - nm thick chromium layer followed by a 30 - nm thick gold layer . The gold - coated surfaces were cleaned for 5 min by UVand ozone treatment ( Jelight Co . ) , rinsed with ethanol , dried with a gentle nitrogen ﬂow and immersed overnight in ethanol containing 0 . 05 mM of NTA - terminated ( 20 % ) and tri ( ethylene glycol ( EG ) ) - terminated ( 80 % ) alkanethiols 21 . After rinsing with ethanol , the samples coated with alkanethiols were immersed in a 40 mM aqueous solution of NiSO 4 ( pH 7 . 2 ) for 1 h , rinsed with PBS , incubated in a PBS solution containing 2 m M rHBHA N - His for 2 h , and ﬁnally rinsed with PBS . The functionalized surfaces were always kept hydrated and used immediately after preparation . Preparation of heparin tips and substrates . Gold - coated canti - levers and substrates were immersed overnight at room tempera - ture in a 25 m g / ml solution of BBSA ( Sigma ) in PBS . After rinsing with PBS , the BBSA surfaces were exposed to a 10 m g / ml solution of streptavidin ( Sigma ) in PBS for 2 h followed by thorough rinsing with PBS . Finally , the BBSA - streptavidin surfaces were immersed for 2 h in a PBS solution containing 10 m g / ml biotinylated heparin ( Sigma ) and rinsed with PBS . AFM measurements . To probe mycobacteria in their native state by AFM , the bacteria were mechanically immobilized onto Isopore polycarbonate membranes ( Millipore ) , an approach that permits the imaging of single cells under aqueous conditions while minimizing denaturation of the specimen 11 . After ﬁltering a concentrated cell suspension , the membrane was ﬁrst imaged at low resolution ( typically 20 m m (cid:1) 20 m m ) to identify single bacteria . Then , by reducing the image size progressively , high - resolution topographic images and adhesion force maps ( 300 nm (cid:1) 300 nm size ) could be recorded at the surface of individual cells . A topographic image was always recorded after a force mapping to conﬁrm that the force measurements were nondestructive . AFM contact mode images and force - distance curves were obtained using a Nanoscope IV Multimode AFM ( Veeco Metrol - ogy Group ) . Measurements were performed in PBS solutions at room temperature using triangular silicon nitride cantilevers ( Microlevers , Veeco Metrology Group ) . Unless otherwise speciﬁed , all force measurements were recorded with a loading rate of 10 , 000 pN / s , calculated by multiplying the tip pulling velocity ( nm / s ) by the spring constant of the cantilever ( pN / nm ) . Blocking experi - ments were performed with a heparin solution ( 50 m g / ml in PBS ) . BSA tips were prepared by incubating gold - coated cantilevers overnight in a BSA solution ( 25 m g / ml in PBS ) and then rinsing with PBS . The spring constants of the cantilevers were estimated as follows . The geometrical dimensions of each functionalized canti - lever were accurately measured by scanning electron microscopy , and their free resonance frequency was measured . Then , their mechanical properties were adjusted to match the calculated frequencies to the measured ones . The determined mechanical properties and the measured geometrical dimensions were then used to calculate the spring constants , yielding values ranging from 0 . 0098 to 0 . 0103 N / m .
