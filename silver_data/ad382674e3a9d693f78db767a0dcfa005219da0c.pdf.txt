Introduction Actin is a fundamental cytoskeletal protein abundantly found in nearly all eukaryotic cells . It is highly con - served protein mediating many processes such as cell growth , motility , structural organization , as well as intracellular trafficking ( Griffin et al . 2014 ) . Being a crit - ical cytoskeletal factor , tight regulation of the rapidly occurring assembly and disassembly of actin filaments is required for proper cellular operation ( Remedios et al . 2003 ) . Throughout the cell , actin is found in two standard forms : globular ( G - actin ) and filamentous ( F - actin ) . The distribution and organization of these filaments into functionally relevant unit is regulated by several actin - binding proteins ( ABPs ) that modulate the underlying polymerization and depolymerization activ - ities ( Griffin et al . 2014 ; Remedios et al . 2003 ) . These actin - binding proteins actively control the overall actin dynamics to perform different functions by modifying its structure both in vitro and in vivo ( Fechheimer and Zigmond 1993 ; Pollard 2016 ) . One of the representative classes of an actin - binding protein includes the gelsolin family , composed of six similar domains namely G1 – G6 each having a Ca 2 + binding site ( Kinosian et al . 1998 ) . This actin depolymerizing factor is found to bind tightly to the growing side of the actin filament thus decreas - ing its size and increasing the amount of monomeric actin present in the actin pool ( Tellam 1985 ) . Function - ally , gelsolin causes rapid disassembly of actin filaments through severing , a mechanism involving breaking of the inner non - covalent bonds to produce shortened , broken filaments ( Sun et al . 1999 ) . Besides , the regula - tion of gelsolin and its counterpart is mainly affected by pH , phosphoinositides , lysophosphatidic acid and Open Access Journal of Analytical Science and Technology * Correspondence : jmchung @ catholic . ac . kr ; hsjung @ kangwon . ac . kr 1 Division of Chemistry , Department of Biochemistry , College of Natural Sciences , Kangwon National University , Chuncheon , Gangwon 24341 , Republic of Korea 3 Department of Biotechnology , The Catholic University of Korea , Bucheon‑si , Gyeonggi 14662 , Republic of Korea Full list of author information is available at the end of the article Page 2 of 6 Kim et al . J Anal Sci Technol ( 2021 ) 12 : 49 high micromolar concentrations of Ca 2 + under physi - ological conditions ( Sun et al . 1999 ; Spinardi and Witke 2007 ) . In certain kinds of eukaryotic cells , gelsolin has been implicated to participate in numerous cytoskeletal events such as cytokinesis , cell movement and apop - tosis besides its generic role as an actin - binding pro - tein ( Lappalainen 2016 ) . Recent studies have shown its critical role in several conditions including amyloidosis , inflammation , cardiovascular diseases and cancer ( Spi - nardi and Witke 2007 ) . Another class of actin - binding protein , ABP34 is a small , 34 kDa crosslinking protein organizing F - actin into condensed bundles in a calcium dependent manner ( Lim et al . 1999 ) . Several in vivo studies have reported a part of this protein involved in the formation of Hirano bodies ( Maselli et al . 2003 ) . Hirano bodies are large , eosinophilic , actin - rich intra - cytoplasmic structures that contain paracrystalline arrays of F - actin ( Goldman 1983 ) and ABPs ( Galloway et al . 1987 ) . Such cytoplasmic actin - rich aggregations comprising actin and ABPs are associated with various neurodegenerative diseases and can assemble as either actin / cofilin rods or Hirano bodies ( Bamburg and Bloom 2009 ; Hirano 1994 ) . Hirano bodies have been found to be associated with various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease ( Gibson and Tom - linson 1977 ; Mitake et al . 1997 ; Schmidt et al . 1989 ) , Pick’s disease ( Schochet et al . 1968 ; Rewcastle and Ball 1968 ) , Guam amylotrophic lateral sclerosis and parkin - sonism - dementia complex ( Hirano et al . 1968 ) , chronic alcoholism ( Laas and Hagel 1994 ) as well as general aging ( Hirano 1994 ) . Despite a large body of literature describing the structure , incidence , and antigens asso - ciated with Hirano bodies , the mechanism of formation remains largely unexplored . Here we demonstrated the potential application of actin - severing protein , gelso - lin on actin - rich intracellular inclusions Hirano body by co - sedimentation assay and TEM . In this study , we used gelsolin to compete with enormous bundled actin filaments for resolving the phenomenon of actin aggregation . Materials and methods Protein sample preparation ABP34 protein was purified from E . coli BL21 ( DE3 ) cells ( Novagen , USA ) ( Chung et al . 2017 ) , dialyzed against buffer containing 50 mM sodium acetate , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 20 mM MOPS , pH 7 . 0 and stored at - 80 °C . Purification of gelsolin protein from bovine serum ( Pel - Freez Biologicals , USA ) was done as per ( Kurokawa et al . 1990 ) which was subjected to dialysis in rigor solution ( relaxing solution without mgATP ) , pH 6 . 5 and stored at - 80 °C . Actin from rabbit skeletal muscle was a generous gift from M . Ikebe laboratory and stored at - 80 oC . Acto‑myosin preparation from scallop tissue The adductor muscle was dissected and cleaned from live scallops which were collected from a local market and placed in rigor solution ( 100 mM NaCl , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM PIPES , 5 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 1 mM EGTA , 1 mM NaN 3 , pH 7 . 0 ) on ice . Muscles were then teased into thin strips and permeabilized with 0 . 5 % saponin rigor solution for 4 h at 4 ℃ with gentle agitation followed by Fig . 1 Electron microscopic analysis of actin‑severing and bundling activities of gelsolin and ABP34 in the presence of Ca 2 + . Negative staining ( NS ) electron micrographs taken from F‑actin alone ( a , b ) ; mixture of F‑actin and gelsolin ( c , d ) ; mixture of F‑actin and ABP34 ( e , f ) . All the samples were mixed in low ionic strength buffer ( at a molar ratio of 1 : 1 ; final concentration 3 μM ) . In the presence of Ca 2 + , actin‑binding proteins typically exhibited their native activity . NS‑electron micrographs were taken at both low 4200 ( a , c and e ; left panels ) and high 34 , 000 ( b , d and f ; right panels ) nominal magnifications . Scale bars represent 2 μm ( a , c and e ) and 200 nm ( b , d and f ) in each field Page 3 of 6 Kim et al . J Anal Sci Technol ( 2021 ) 12 : 49 thorough rinsing in rigor solution ( Jung and Craig 2008 ) . The weighed muscle tissue ( approx . 0 . 4 g ) was washed thrice using wash buffer ( 40 mM NaCl , 5 mM phosphate buffer ) . It was efficiently chopped and homogenized using HG - 15D homogenizer ( Daihan Scientific , R . O . K ) at 15 , 000 rpm for 1 min on ice . The resulting suspension was re - homogenized with a glass homogenizer ( Whea - ton , U . S ) under “low ionic buffer” condition ( 20 mM PIPES , 50 mM KCl , 5 mM EGTA , 1 mM MgCl 2 , pH 7 . 0 ) on ice with 3 – 5 full passes ( Jung et al . 2008a ) . The prepa - ration was immediately centrifuged using Micro 17TR ( Hanil Science , R . O . K ) at 15 , 000 rpm for 10 min . The resulting pellet containing acto - myosin was resuspended up to 4 ml with relaxing solution , pH 6 . 5 and equally dis - tributed into 4 tubes . Gelsolin treatment in scallop muscle In the first place , 1 mM mgATP was added to each tube containing the resuspended acto - myosin suspension . Next , each tube was treated for 30 min with different conditions involving 5 . 1 mM CaCl 2 and 3 uM gelsolin either alone or in combination , except for the control . This was then centrifuged to confirm the migration of actin band by SDS - PAGE . The gels were stained with Coomasie Brilliant Blue R - 250 ( Bio - Rad ) and analyzed using ImageJ software ( Schneider et al . 2012 ) whereas the statistical procedures were performed using SigmaPlot ( Systat Software , San Jose , CA , USA ) . Actin co‑sedimentation assay Co - sedimentation assay was conducted to understand the binding activity of actin with ABP34 and gelso - lin . Actin was first polymerized under low ionic buffer ( 20 mM PIPES , 50 mM KCl , 5 mM EGTA , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM mgATP , pH 7 . 0 ) for 1 h at room temperature form - ing F - actin . The F - actin was then mixed in equal pro - portion with ABP34 protein ( 3 μM ) for 30 min at RT to form the actin bundles ( Kim et al . 2015 ) . Gelsolin ( 3 μM ) was mixed with the former F - actin / ABP34 mixture for 30 min at RT followed by centrifugation in Micro 17TR Fig . 2 SDS – PAGE and electron microscopic analysis of co‑sedimentation assay .

Here the molecular states were dramatically changed when the molar ratio was modulated to 1 : 1 : 2 and depolymerization states of the mixture were visualized in ( f , ( c . f . c ) ) . Scale bars represent 200 nm in each field Page 4 of 6 Kim et al . J Anal Sci Technol ( 2021 ) 12 : 49 ( Hanil , R . O . K ) at 15 , 000 RPM for 10 min ( Kinosian et al . 1998 ) . The obtained supernatant and pellet fractions were collected and analyzed by gel electrophoresis . Low ionic buffer conditions were maintained throughout the experiment . Transmission electron microscopy An aliquot of 5 μl of the sample under investigation was applied to a carbon - coated grid formerly glow - dis - charged ( Harrick plasma , USA ) for 3 min in air . The grid was negatively stained with 1 % uranyl acetate ( Jung et al . 2008b ) . The prepared grids were examined by Technai 10 TEM system ( FEI , USA ) operating at 100 kV . Images were acquired with UltraScan 1000 CCD camera ( Gatan , USA ) . Instrumentation was used in Kangwon Center for Systems Imaging , Chuncheon , Republic of Korea . Results and discussion Activity of actin‑binding proteins in the presence of calcium Negatively stained electron micrographs were analyzed to understand the activity of actin in the presence of Ca 2 + with or without ABPs such as ABP34 and Gelsolin . In the presence of Ca 2 , G - actins were polymerized to from a fil - amentous actin called F - actin ( Fig . 1a , b ) . However , when the F - actins were treated with gelsolin , they were depo - lymerized causing the formation of relatively shorter and fewer F - actin molecules ( Fig . 1c , d ) . Compared to that , ABP34 effectively caused the formation of F - actin bun - dles in the presence of Ca 2 ( Fig . 1e , f ) . These implies that in the presence of Ca 2 + , both gelsolin and ABP34 effec - tively execute their functions over F - actin such severing and bundling activities , respectively . Poor tendency of actin aggregation in the presence of gelsolin To understand the effect of gelsolin on the actin - bundling activity of ABP34 , co - sedimentation assay was conducted ( Fig . 2 ) . When actin was incubated with gelsolin , it was found in the supernatant , while the band were predomi - nantly seen in the pallet when it was treated with ABP34 ( Fig . 2a ) . And also , the actin band significantly shifted to the supernatant when the two APBs were mixed together along with actin ( Molar ratio 1 : 1 : 1 ) , indicating that the severing activity of gelsolin somehow affect the actin - bundling function of ABP34 . To evaluate the mechanism of the inhibition effect of gelsolin on the actin - bundling activity of ABP34 , actin was incubated with both ABPs in different orders . In the experiment , the inhibition effect of gelsolin was more effective when it was incubated with actin before adding ABP34 , suggesting that both ABP34 and gelsolin share same binding sties on F - actin ( Fig . 2b , d , e ) . Notably , the actin bundles formed by ABP34 was eliminated by the doubled concentration of gelsolin , indicating that gelsolin has stronger binding affinity then ABP34 ( Fig . 2c , f ) . Gelsolin activity on actin aggregation in muscle To understand the effect of gelsolin on the actin aggrega - tion in the physiological environment , co - sedimentation assay was demonstrated using scallop muscle tissue . Based on the analysis of migration pattern of actin band , addition of Gelsolin in the presence of Ca 2 + showed actin - band shift from pallet to supernatant significantly , Fig . 3 Gelsolin activity in scallop muscle .

J Anal Sci Technol ( 2021 ) 12 : 49 and this indicates that gelsolin enable its inhibition effect on the actin bundling formation in the physiological con - ditions ( Fig . 3a , b ) . In this study , a decreasing tendency of aggregated actin by gelsolin molecules was determined through co - sed - imentation assay and EM analysis . Taken together , we proposed that addition of gelsolin can eliminate aggre - gated form of actin , and this can be used to purify actin more efficiently from muscle tissue ( Fig . 4 ) . Further - more , this finding can also provide fundamental clue on further studies devising a novel therapeutic approach to treat various actin aggregation related diseases ( Carnell and Insall 2011 ; Gourlay and Ayscough 2005 ) . A previ - ous study demonstrating the role of actin - severing pro - teins in a variety of neurodegenerative conditions showed increased vulnerability to excitotoxicity when gelsolin deficiency was present in hippocampal neurons , both in cell culture and in vivo ( Furukawa et al . 1997 ) . Moreover , a study investigating the effect of antibiotics on the actin aggregates concluded that the actin aggregates are signifi - cant therapeutic target site not only for the treatment of various neurovegetative diseases , but also neurodevelop - mental disorders ( Pathak et al . 2016 ) . Although , this is in very early stage of studying new therapeutic strategies for neurogenerative conditions associated with actin aggregation , it provided a funda - mental knowledge of how actin - severing proteins could be used to solve problems involved in the neurovegeta - tive diseases ( Furukawa et al . 1997 ; Pathak et al . 2016 ; Moseley et al . 2006 ) .
