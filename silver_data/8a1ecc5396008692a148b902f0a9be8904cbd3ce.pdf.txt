Results : Using microﬂuidics and live - cell microscopy , coupled with new computational methods for image analysis , we investigated septin function during pheromone - dependent chemotropic growth in yeast . We show that septins colocalize with the regulator of G protein signaling ( RGS ) Sst2 , a GTPase - activating protein that dampens pheromone receptor signaling . We show further that the septin structure surrounds the polar cap , ensuring that cell growth is directed toward the source of pheromone . When RGS activity is abrogated , sep - tins are partially disorganized . Under these circumstances , the polar cap travels toward septin structures and away from sites of exocytosis , resulting in a loss of gradient tracking . Conclusions : SeptinorganizationisdependentonRGSprotein activity . When assembled correctly , septins promote turning of the polar cap and proper tracking of a pheromone gradient . Introduction To respond to spatial cues in their environment , cells must be capable of detecting and transforming those signals into an appropriate response . For example , neutrophils follow a gradient of secreted factors to ﬁnd and destroy invading path - ogens [ 1 ] . Similarly , the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae can expand toward a gradient of pheromone to ﬁnd a mating partner [ 2 , 3 ] . In this instance of yeast chemotropic growth , detection of the pheromone gradient is accomplished by a G protein - coupled receptor . The receptor activates a large G protein composed of an a subunit , Gpa1 , and a G bg dimer of Ste4 and Ste18 [ 4 ] . Upon activation , Gpa1 - GTP dissociates from the G bg dimer [ 5 ] . Free G bg then recruits scaffolds and kinases to initiate two effector pathways , one leading to acti - vation of a mitogen - activated protein kinase and to transcrip - tional induction , and the second leading to activation of the small G protein Cdc42 [ 5 ] . It is this second pathway that en - sures proper expansion toward a pheromone gradient [ 2 , 6 ] . In particular , G bg recruitment of the guanine nucleotide ex - change factor Cdc24 ensures that activation of Cdc42 is spatially coupled to sites of receptor activation [ 7 , 8 ] . Cdc42 - GTP promotes actin polymerization and exocytosis , thereby deﬁning the polarity of the cell [ 9 ] . Cdc42 and the machinery that drives its spatial distribution are collectively known as the polar cap [ 10 ] . The pheromone - induced morphogenesis pathway shares many components with the mitosis / budding machinery . How - ever , whereas bud site formation occurs in response to an in - ternal , static queue [ 11 ] , chemotropic growth is dynamic so as to adapt to changing external signals [ 2 , 12 ] . Such dynamic behavior is accomplished by pheromone signaling factors up - stream of Cdc42 in the pathway . Aside from the pheromone re - ceptor and G protein there are three proteins known to be required for gradient tracking : Fus3 , Far1 , and Sst2 [ 3 , 13 , 14 ] . Far1 is necessary for gradient tracking because it couples Cdc24 to free G bg , which results in the production of Cdc42 - GTP proximal to sites of pheromone binding [ 7 , 15 ] . Without this cue the Cdc42 polarity machinery is spatially uncoupled from receptor activation , and the cells expand in a random di - rection [ 15 , 16 ] . Fus3 is required to phosphorylate Far1 , pro - moting release of Far1 from the nucleus and delivery to G bg [ 7 , 13 , 14 , 16 , 17 ] . The role of Sst2 is , by comparison , poorly un - derstood . Sst2 is the founding member of the regulator of G protein signaling ( RGS ) family [ 18 ] . It binds to the pheromone receptor and also functions as a GTPase - activating protein ( GAP ) for Gpa1 [ 19 , 20 ] . Both functions contribute equally to desensitization of the pathway [ 21 ] . However , it is the GAP ac - tivity alone that is required for proper gradient tracking [ 21 ] . In this study , we demonstrate that Sst2 promotes polarized cell expansion , and does so by organizing the localization of cytoskeletal scaffolding proteins known as septins [ 22 , 23 ] . We thought to examine septins because of their well - charac - terized role during mitosis . Septins form a double - ring struc - ture at the mother - daughter bud neck , serving as a diffusional barrier between the two cells [ 24 ] and constraining the move - ment of the polar cap [ 25 , 26 ] . Likewise , septin bundles form at the base of the mating projection , or ‘‘shmoo’’ tip [ 27 , 28 ] . In this case , septins are organized parallel to the axis of the shmoo and have no known barrier function [ 28 ] . Here we show that Sst2 GAP activity is required to maintain separation of the polar cap and septins . In the absence of GAP activity , septins distribute asymmetrically and the polar cap follows . Thus , Sst2 acts to limit movement of the polar cap and prevent aberrant turning from the pheromone gradient . Collectively , these ﬁndings reveal a new function for RGS proteins in mem - brane trafﬁcking and cytoskeletal organization , as well as a new role for septins in gradient tracking behavior . Results Sst2 Promotes the Persistence of Polarized Growth In preparation for mating , yeast cells stop dividing and instead form a pear - shaped structure , or shmoo , that is competent to fuse with cells of the opposite mating type . In addition to the * Correspondence : timothy _ elston @ med . unc . edu ( T . C . E . ) , henrik _ dohlman @ med . unc . edu ( H . G . D . ) budding ( no pheromone ) and shmooing ( high pheromone ) morphologies , there exists a third morphogenic state , evident at intermediate pheromone concentrations , where cells have stopped dividing but continue to grow in the direction of a weak pheromone gradient [ 14 ] . We refer to this as ‘‘elongated’’ or ‘‘chemotropic’’ growth . During chemotropic growth , the po - lar cap wanders back and forth across the growing edge of the cell , and this behavior is required for gradient tracking [ 29 ] . Given that Sst2 is also required for cells to track a gradient [ 3 , 21 ] , we considered the role of Sst2 in controlling the move - ment of the polar cap . We began by comparing the distribution of the polar cap in wild - type cells and in mutant cells lacking Sst2 ( sst2 D ) . Experiments were performed in a custom - de - signed microﬂuidic device that produces a gradient across the cells [ 16 , 21 ] . Using the microﬂuidic chamber , we exposed cells to a 0 – 150 nM gradient of pheromone and examined the localization of the Cdc42 - GTP - binding protein Bem1 over time [ 30 , 31 ] . We used the same gradient conditions throughout to ensure equal receptor occupancy . As shown in Figure 1A , wild - type cells initially polarized to the site of cytokinesis but later redirected growth in the direction of the gradient ( Movie S1 available online ) . In contrast , the sst2 D mutant cells turned frequently , and often abruptly , away from the gradient ( Fig - ure 1A ; Movie S2 ) . To quantify gradient tracking behaviors , we used four read - outs of polar cap function : angle of orientation , frequency of turning , memory , and persistence . The angle of orientation is deﬁned as the angle between the polar cap ( determined by the method shown in Figure S1A ) and the direction of the gradient . Perfect alignment toward the gradient is deﬁned as zero . As shown in Figure 1B , wild - type cells became oriented within 100 min . However , in sst2 D cells , the angle of orientation tended to move in a single direction across the periphery of the cell , and over an extended period of time ( Figure 1B ) . This ‘‘spinning’’ behavior is evident from time - averaged polar cap tracks of individual cells shown in Figure 1C . In cells lacking Sst2 , the average path of the polar cap exhibited turns that were both sharper and more frequent than those seen in wild - type cells . To quantify the turning behavior , we next examined the frequency of turns greater than 60 (cid:1) . Whereas wild - type cells displayed large turns less than 1 % of the time , cells lacking Sst2 displayed large turns 13 % of the time ( Figure 1D ) . A third measure of polar cap function is memory , or the time period for which the current angle of orientation is correlated with future angles of orientation ( autocorrelation ) . By this measure , we found that the memory of sst2 D cells was roughly twice that of wild - type ( Figure 1E ) . That is , the polar cap sweeps uniformly in one direction for a longer period of time in sst2 D cells . Finally , we measured persistence of growth , deﬁned as the difference between the position of the polar cap at the beginning and end of a ﬁxed time interval divided by the total length of the path traveled by the polar cap during that interval ( Figure 1F ) . A persistence of 1 implies that the polar cap moved in a straight line during the time inter - val , and values less than 1 indicate polar cap wandering . As shown in Figure 1F , cells lacking Sst2 displayed half the persis - tence of that shown by wild - type cells . Taken together , these data suggest that Sst2 constrains movement of the polar cap , thereby promoting directed expansion toward a stimulus . Sst2 localization to the periphery of the cell is dependent upon interaction with the pheromone receptor Ste2 [ 20 ] . We have shown previously that Sst2 localization is highly dynamic , and after prolonged pheromone treatment the protein be - comes concentrated at the base of the mating projection A C D E G F B Figure 1 .

This subcellular distribution of Sst2 is remi - niscent of septin localization [ 28 ] . The septin collar is well known to restrict polar cap movement during mitosis [ 25 , 26 ] , but little is known about the role of septin bundles in che - motropic growth or how their localization is regulated .

See also Figure S2 and Movies S3 and S4 . examine the functional relationship be - tween these proteins , we began by monitoring Sst2 - GFP localization in cells expressing the septin marker Cdc3 - mCherry [ 32 ] . We observed overlapping localization of these proteins in shmoo - ing ( Figure 1G ) and elongated cells ( Fig - ures S1B and S1C ) . By associating with the septin structure in this way , Sst2 may serve to restrict the movement of the polar cap past septins and drive it back toward the center of the shmoo tip . Septin Structures Are Formed during Chemotropic Growth Septins are known to form a bundled structure of ﬁbers along the side of the shmoo at the base of the mating projec - tion . This pattern of assembly is in contrast to the double - ring structure formed orthogonally to the mother - daughter axis in mitosis [ 23 , 27 , 28 ] . Although the septin structure formed at the base of the shmoo does not appear to be contiguous ( Figure 1G ) [ 28 ] , and therefore is unlikely to form a physical diffusion barrier , scaffolding of the nega - tive regulator Sst2 may serve to create a biochemical boundary around the polar cap . Accordingly , we next investigated whether septins form a deﬁned structure duringchemotropicgrowth , andwhether that structure is required for gradient tracking . To that end , we monitoredseptins ( usingCdc3 - mCherry [ 32 ] ) andthepolarcap ( using Bem1 - GFP ) over time . In high pheromone ( 300 nM uni - form ) , septins formed structures at the base of the mating pro - jection , as previously reported [ 27 , 28 ] ( Figure 2A ; Movie S3 ) . In 277 a pheromone gradient ( 0 – 150 nM ) , septins formed discernible structures at the periphery of the elongated cells ( Figure 2B ; Movie S4 ) . These structures appeared to be excluded from the sites of polarity , as deﬁned by Bem1 . To compare changes in the polar cap and septins over time , we plotted the A B C D E Figure 3 .

See also Movies S5 and S6 . distribution of Cdc3 and Bem1 as line scans taken around the cell boundary ( kymographs ) ( Figures 2C and 2D ) . Note that the cells start in mitosis , so the strong initial septin staining represents the mitotic ring . These ﬁgures clearly demonstrate that , as cells elongate , the polar patch is constrained between re - gions of high Cdc3 concentration . To quantify these results , we calculated the correlation coefﬁcient over time , be - tween the polar cap and septins , from the average of many individual cells . As shown in Figure 2E , the correlation coef - ﬁcient started high during mitosis , then decreased after w 100 min , and eventu - ally became anticorrelated during che - motropic growth . Interestingly , this change coincides with a decrease in po - lar cap angle variation ( Figure 1B ) , sug - gesting that septins help to stabilize the position of the polar cap . The anticorre - lation was stronger in elongating ( che - motropic ) cells ( Figure 2E , blue curve ) than in shmooing cells ( Figure 2E , green curve ) . This difference is likely due to the much larger surface area in elon - gating cells . Thus , itappearsthatseptins form symmetric structures that surround andexcludethepolarcapduringchemo - tropic growth . Sst2 Is Necessary for Proper Septin Organization As shown above , septins and Sst2 co - localize to the boundary of the polar cap during both shmooing and elon - gated growth . Given that sst2 D mutants fail to undergo persistent directional movement ( Figure 1 ) , we hypothesized that these cells might also be deﬁcient in boundary function . To that end , we exam - ined septin localization in the sst2 D mutant strain ( Figure 3 ) . In this case , septins exhibited aberrant colocalization with the polar cap in high pheromone concentrations ( Figures 3A and 278 3C ; Movie S5 ) as well as aberrant organization and occasional colocalization in a pheromone gradient ( Figures 3B and 3D ; Movie S6 ) . The prolonged loss of Cdc3 is distinct from the dispersal that typically occurs following mitosis ( Figure 2D ) . In a high dose , the septin structure appeared to be mislocal - ized to the polar cap rather than forming a symmetric structure at the boundary . Under gradient conditions , cells alternated between elongation and turning , with random positioning of septin structures . The same aberrant behavior was seen after chitin staining , demonstrating that the septin misorganization is not an artifact of the ﬂuorescently tagged Cdc3 ( Figure S2 ) . From these data , we conclude that Sst2 is necessary for proper septin localization and segregation from the polar cap during shmooing as well as during elongated growth . GAP Activity Is Necessary for Proper Septin Structure Formation Sst2 has two known binding partners . First , Sst2 binds to Gpa1 and accelerates GTPase activity [ 19 ] . Second , Sst2 binds to the C - terminal tail of the receptor Ste2 [ 20 ] . We have previously shown that these interactions contribute equally to attenuating the response to pheromone but that GAP activity alone is needed for proper chemotropic growth [ 21 ] . Because deletion of Sst2 disrupts both functions , we used point mutants that selectively uncouple the interactions . The RGS mutant sst2 Q304N decreases Sst2 binding to the receptor while leaving RGS - G protein interactions intact [ 20 ] . The G protein mutant gpa1 G302S decreases Sst2 binding to the G protein a subunit ( Figure 4A ) , abrogating RGS - stimulated GTPase activity but leaving both intrinsic GTPase activity and G bg binding unal - tered [ 33 ] . As shown in Figure 4B , cells bearing the receptor - uncoupled Sst2 mutant exhibited normal septin structures and separation from the polar cap . In contrast , cells express - ing the unGAPable gpa1 G302S mutant exhibited abnormal sep - tin structures and aberrant colocalization of the polar cap and septins ( Figure 4B ) . The altered localization persisted throughout the experiment ( Figure 4C , yellow curve ) , as seen in the sst2 D cells ( Figure 4C , purple curve ) . Because the sst2 Q304N and gpa1 G302S strains are equally sensitive to phero - mone [ 21 ] , the defect exhibited by gpa1 G302S is not due to altered signaling strength . Thus , GAP activity is required for proper polarization and septin structure formation during che - motropic growth . Deﬁning the Spatial Distribution of Proteins at the Site of Polarity A signiﬁcant challenge in single - cell analysis is to relate the behavior of individual cells to general trends in the population . This is a particular challenge when tracking the localization of proteins on the leading edge of the cell , given that they display signiﬁcant heterogeneity in space and over time . We reasoned that by using the polar cap as a point of reference , we would be able to discern patterns in protein distribution across the lead - ing edge . To that end , we developed a method to conduct pair - wise spatial comparisons of a given protein to active Cdc42 ( indicated by Bem1 - GFP ) . Our method is analogous to one used previously to compare the temporal activation of Rho family members in mammalian cells [ 34 ] . Speciﬁcally , we generated Cdc3 proﬁles at each time point , using the peak in - tensity of Bem1 as a common reference point . The data were then normalized such that the ﬂuorescence distribution at each time point sums to 1 , and averaged for 25 or more individ - ual cells ( Figure 5 , top ) . We further combined the data ( time points > 150 min ) to create a single distribution for protein localization versus distance from peak Cdc42 - GTP ( Figure 5 , bottom ) . As shown in Figure 5 , septins were properly resolved from the polar cap in wild - type cells starting at w 120 min . The sep - aration was evident after treatment with either 0 – 150 nM or 300 nM pheromone , but was more pronounced in elongating cells than in shmooing cells ( compare Figures 5A and 5B ) . Again , the observed differences in septin separation are ex - pected , given the larger size of the leading edge in elongating cells . Cells lacking Sst2 showed a strong ( aberrant ) accumula - tion of septins at the polar cap following treatment with 300 nM pheromone ( shmoo formation ) but a mostly ﬂat septin distribu - tion at 0 – 150 nM pheromone ( elongated morphology ) . The ﬂat distribution of septins should not be interpreted as a complete lack of septin structures ; rather , any septin structures were likely to be randomly distributed with respect to the polar cap , and therefore the location of the polar cap would not be predictive of septin localization . The proﬁles of the receptor - uncoupled sst2 Q304N and the GAP - deﬁcient gpa1 G302S mutants resembled wild - type and sst2 D cells , respectively ( Figures 5B and 5C ) . By this approach , we consistently saw a spike of A B C Figure4 .

This new method of analysis provides quantitative infor - mation about the position of septins relative to Bem1 and , more broadly , can be used to compare the position of any membrane - associated protein relative to the polar cap . Below we use this method to compare distributions of different pro - teins across multiple strains . GAP Function Promotes Focused Exocytosis We next considered the role of Sst2 in membrane trafﬁcking . Exocytosis and endocytosis are important for the establish - ment of polarity and for gradient tracking in yeast [ 37 – 40 ] . Exocytosis is responsible for delivery of proteins to the site of polarity , and has been implicated in polar cap wandering as well as the promotion of gradient tracking [ 29 ] . Moreover , the delivery of naive vesicles to the polar cap may help push septins into their characteristic ring shape , as occurs during budding [ 26 ] . Conversely , endocytosis removes proteins as they diffuse toward the periphery of the polar cap [ 38 , 39 ] . Given the potential roles of vesicle trafﬁcking in polarity and in septin structure formation , we next examined the role of Sst2 GAP activity in endocytosis and exocytosis . To that end , we examined the distribution of known markers for endocytosis ( Ede1 - GFP ) [ 41 ] and exocytosis ( Exo84 - GFP ) [ 42 ] relative to the polar cap in both wild - type and the GAP - deﬁcient gpa1 G302S strains treated with 300 nM pheromone ( Figure 6A ) . The regions of exocytosis and endocytosis are diagrammed in Figure 6B , where each line represents the me - dian distance of the marker protein from the center of the polar cap . As shown in Figure 6C , we observed the same relative distri - bution of Bem1 and the endocytic marker in both the wild - type and the GAP - deﬁcient mutant cells . Cells lacking GAP activity exhibited an unusual broadening in the distribution of the exo - cytic marker ; however , there was no change in the shape of the marker when aligned to itself ( Figure S3A ) . Thus , the observed distribution arose from increased variability in the site of exocytosis relative to the polar cap . Likewise , the mutant cells exhibited mislocalized septins with a broadened distribution similar to that of the endocytic marker . These data indicate that the GAP activity of Sst2 is necessary to restrict the area in which exocytosis occurs , and to promote separation of sep - tins from sites of endocytosis . A B C Figure 5 .

Thespikein Cdc3 at peak Bem1 is not due to bleedthrough . Data shown are derived from the experiments shown in Figures 2 , 3 , and 4 . 280 The defects in septin localization were most evident in cells that were spinning . This correlation prompted us to ask whether septins might inﬂuence the direction of travel . To that end , we sorted the septin proﬁles into two groups based on the direction of movement . When we oriented each of the proﬁles in the same direction and averaged the distribution , we observed a striking enrichment of septins in advance of the polar cap ( Figure 6D ) . Whereas the polar cap moved to - ward septins , it moved away from the sites of exocytosis and endocytosis . Both types of trafﬁcking were asymmetri - cally distributed behind the polar cap ( w 67 % higher frequency behind the cap than in front of the cap ; Figures S3B and S3C ) . Based on current models [ 29 ] , the asymmetric distribution of exocytosis would be predicted to drive movement of the polar cap in the opposite direction of the fusion event . Although the trend to move toward septins was most obvious in the gpa1 G302S mutant , the same phenomenon was evident in those rare wild - type cells that were initially A C E F D B Figure 6 .

The scale bars represent 5 m m . See also Figure S3 . 281 misaligned and had to turn toward the gradient ( Figure 6E ) . Thus , in addition to restricting the range of motion of the polar cap , it appears that septins direct the polar cap toward the pheromone stimulus . The septins , in turn , are most likely to follow the pheromone receptor Ste2 . In support of this idea , we found that receptors were consistently enriched , together with septins , on the inside of turning cells ( Figures 6E and 6F ) . From these data , we conclude that septins bias the direc - tion of polar cap movement . Our results indicated that septin structures bias polar cap movement in cells that are turning , as occurs during gradient tracking . Thus , we considered whether septins are needed to track a gradient . For these experiments , we tested a strain bearing a temperature - sensitive septin mutation , cdc12 - 6 [ 43 ] . As shown in Figure 7 , the mutant strain was unable to track a 0 – 150 nM gradient at the restrictive temperature . To accommodate the response at the higher temperature , we also tested the cdc12 - 6 strain in a 0 – 600 nM gradient . The A C E F D B Figure 7 . Septins Are Required for Gradient Tracking ( A – D ) Wild - type ( A ) ( n = 40 ) and cdc12 - 6 cells ( B ) ( n = 56 ) expressing Bem1 - GFP were exposed to a 0 – 150 nM gradient of pheromone ( high on the right ) at 37 (cid:1) C . Gradient tracking was assessed at 3 hr and is displayed as a polar histogram . Bar length represents the fraction of cells oriented to the given angle ; 0 (cid:1) is upgradient .

( F ) The role of Sst2 in gradient tracking . In wild - type cells , Sst2 is localized to the septin structures surrounding the polar cap and promotes conversion of Gpa1 - GTP to Gpa1 - GDP . Exocytic events occur near the center of the polar cap , driving wandering . In the absence of Sst2 , septins no longer exclude the polar cap , biasing exocytic events to the opposite side of the polar cap relative to septins . The biased exocytic events push the polar cap consistently to - ward the septins , resulting in sharp turns , or spinning of the polar cap around the periphery of the cell . 282 mutant strain was able to properly track a gradient at the semi - permissive temperature ( 30 (cid:1) C ) but not at the fully restrictive temperature ( 37 (cid:1) C ) . The septin - deﬁcient cells still elongated in a straight line ( Figures 7B and 7D ) , suggesting that the tracking defect was due to an inability of the cells to turn and that any septin boundary function is unnecessary for persis - tent polar cap movement . Taken together , our data indicate that Sst2 is required for proper septin organization , and that organized septins are required to dynamically regulate polar cap movement in response to a pheromone stimulus . Discussion Here we describe several new and unexpected functions for two well - known signaling proteins . In particular , we show that the RGS protein Sst2 is required for proper septin organi - zation , and that septins are required for proper gradient tracking . By orienting cell expansion toward a weak phero - mone gradient , the RGS and septins work together to promote cell - cell interactions leading to mating . In the absence of RGS function , septin structures are disorganized and become colo - calized with the polar cap . As a consequence , the polar cap turns past the source of pheromone and the cell expands in the wrong direction . Thus , in the absence of well - organized septins , cells no longer track a gradient of pheromone . Central to our analysis was the development of a new computational method for determining the spatial distribution of membrane proteins . By this method , we have shown that the polar cap is bounded by septins and by Sst2 . In the absence of Sst2 , the septins no longer exclude the polar cap . However , the septins may nevertheless function as a bar - rier to exocytic events , because exocytosis occurs asymmet - rically , away from septin structures . Measuring the probability distribution of proteins at the leading edge , as we have done here , could be used to inform both deterministic and probabi - listic models of cell signaling . By performing the analysis over time for single cells , such distribution proﬁles can be sorted based on metadata such as angle of orientation of the polar cap , direction of travel , and speed of travel . With sufﬁciently fast sampling , the approach could lead to improved under - standing of how trafﬁcking inﬂuences morphogenesis . Whereas septins are well known to facilitate mitosis , their contribution to other morphogenic states has received little attention . During mitosis , septins form a characteristic dou - ble - ring structure that is thought to prevent the exchange of membrane proteins between mother and daughter cells [ 22 ] . Inpheromone - treatedcells , septinsinsteadassembleasparal - lelﬁbersthatwouldpresumably allowsomediffusion ofthepo - lar cap [ 28 ] . Our observations reveal additional important dif - ferences between mitotic and chemotropic cells . Although septins are necessary for proper budding , we have shown here that they are dispensable for elongated cell growth . Another major difference between mitosis and chemotropic growth is the role of Sst2 . Although Sst2 is not required for mitosis , wehaveshownherethatitisrequiredforproperseptin organization during chemotropic growth . In mitotic cells , sep - tins recruit the GAPs for Cdc42 [ 44 , 45 ] . It has recently been suggested by Okada et al . that the association of Cdc42 GAPs with the septin ring forms a negative feedback loop necessary for septin ring formation during mitosis [ 26 ] . In che - motropic cells , septins do not recruit GAPs for Cdc42 ( Fig - ure S4 ) but instead recruit Sst2 , the GAP for Gpa1 . Thus , whereas mitotic cells exhibit localized inactivation of Cdc42 , chemotropic cells limit the activation of Cdc42 indirectly through inhibition of Gpa1 . In either case , the polar cap is de - stabilized in the vicinity of the septin ring , leading to directed cellular expansion . Although septins are dispensable for forming elongated structures , they are required for turning toward a gradient . This indicates that the septin barrier function is dispensable for persistent growth . Rather , it is likely that the mislocalization of septins , seen in sst2 D cells , leads to aberrant turning and inability to track a gradient . This observation is consistent with earlier ﬁndings that mislocalized septins can lead to morphological defects [ 46 ] . Another contributor to cell polarization is vesicle trafﬁcking . There is emerging evidence that exocytosis of vesicles clears existing proteins from the site of delivery , thereby pushing the septins into their characteristic ring structure [ 26 ] . Because the exocytic vesicles lack activated Cdc42 , these fusion events are likely to trigger some degree of wandering by the emerging polar cap [ 29 ] . Conversely , it is unclear whether endocytosis has the ability to inﬂuence polar cap movement . Rather , endo - cytosis is thought to promote the removal of proteins as they diffuse away from the leading edge , thereby restricting their distribution to an area surrounding the polar cap [ 38 , 39 ] . Taken together , our ﬁndings reveal a likely mechanism by which RGS proteins and septins cooperate to promote gradient tracking behavior ( Figure 7 ) . During chemotropic growth , as in mitosis , septins set the boundary for polar cap migration and the delivery of exocytic vesicles . In contrast to mitosis , these septin structures assemble over a much larger area , are more diffuse , and are more dynamic . Because of its relatively broad distribution in chemotropic cells , the polar cap has more opportunity to wander [ 29 , 40 ] . Such wandering behavior would presumably allow the cell to change polar cap orientation and improve gradient tracking [ 29 ] . When Sst2 is absent , the septins are malformed and polar cap wandering is exaggerated . The loss of Sst2 does not affect mitosis because the mitotic septin ring structure ﬁxes the polar cap position , and the site of bud emergence does not change over time or in the presence of an external stimulus [ 25 ] . In conclusion , we have deﬁned a new role for RGS proteins as regulators of septin organization , distinct from their role as regulators of G protein signaling . Further , we have deﬁned a new role for septins in chemotropic growth , distinct from their role in mitotic cell division . Given the similarities in G protein signaling across species , our ﬁndings are likely to ﬁnd parallels in more complex systems , including neutrophil migration and cancer metastasis .
