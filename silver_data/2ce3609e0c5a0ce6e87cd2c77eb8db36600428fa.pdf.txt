1225 Research Article Introduction The actin cytoskeleton is highly dynamic and must be remodelled rapidly to perform its essential roles in cell morphogenesis and motility , and other membrane - associated events such as endocytosis , phagocytosis and cytokinesis . Organization and dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton are regulated by a large set of proteins that interact with monomeric and / or filamentous actin ( reviewed by Pollard and Borisy , 2002 ; Paavilainen et al . , 2004 ; Nicholson - Dykstra et al . , 2005 ) . A key player in the rapid turnover of actin networks is ADF / cofilin , which severs and / or depolymerises actin filaments ( Carlier et al . , 1997 ) . This leads to the rapid accumulation of ADF / cofilin - bound ADP - actin monomers , which are inhibited from undergoing nucleotide exchange . Two conserved cellular factors implicated in recycling ADP - actin monomers to an ATP - bound and assembly - competent state are profilin and Srv2 . Profilins are small proteins ( 12 - 15 kDa ) that bind ATP - actin monomers with high affinity and catalyze nucleotide exchange ( ATP for ADP ) on actin ( Witke , 2004 ) . When bound to an actin monomer , profilin inhibits spontaneous filament nucleation and blocks addition of monomers to the pointed ends of filaments . On the other hand , profilin promotes addition of actin subunits to the free barbed ends of filaments ( Pantaloni and Carlier , 1993 ) and targets actin growth to barbed ends capped by regulators such as Ena / VASP and formins ( reviewed by Krause et al . , 2003 ; Goode and Eck , 2007 ) . Genetic studies have demonstrated that profilin plays an essential role in regulating actin dynamics in flies , yeasts , mammals and Dictyostelium ( Witke , 2004 ) . Together with ADF / cofilin , Arp2 / 3 complex and capping protein , profilin is one of the core components sufficient to promote actin - based motility of Listeria in vitro ( Loisel et al . , 1999 ) . In addition to binding G - actin , profilin interacts with phosphoinositides and proline - rich sequence motifs . The PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - and actin - binding surfaces on profilin partially overlap and thus actin binding is inhibited by phosphoinositides ( Skare and Karlsson , 2002 ; Lambrechts et al . , 2002 ) . However , the polyproline - binding site on profilin is separate and completely non - overlapping with its actin - binding site ; thus , profilin can simultaneously interact with poly - L - proline and G - actin ( Mahoney et al . , 1997 ) . Poly - L - proline binding is thought to target profilin – actin - monomer complexes to sites of rapid actin assembly in cells by delivering actin monomers to polymerizing filament barbed ends ( Witke , 2004 ) . Indeed , profilin binds to many proline - rich proteins that are known to promote filament barbed end elongation , including VASP , N - WASP and formins ( Reinhard et al . , 1995 ; Suetsugu et al . , 1998 ; Vavylonis et al . , 2006 ) . Consistent with these roles , mutant profilins defective in polyproline binding fail to complement profilin - null cells in yeast ( Wolven et al . , 2000 ; Lu and Pollard , 2001 ) . Cyclase - associated protein ( CAP ) is a highly conserved actin monomer binding protein found in all eukaryotic organisms examined ( Hubberstey and Mottillo , 2002 ) . It was first identified in budding yeast as both a factor associated with adenylyl cyclase ( Field et al . , 1990 ) and a suppressor of the activated ras allele ( Fedor - Chaiken et al . , 1990 ) . The yeast CAP homolog is named Srv2 and binds to adenylyl cyclase Profilin and cyclase - associated protein ( CAP , known in yeast as Srv2 ) are ubiquitous and abundant actin monomer - binding proteins . Profilin catalyses the nucleotide exchange on actin monomers and promotes their addition to filament barbed ends . Srv2 / CAP recycles newly depolymerized actin monomers from ADF / cofilin for subsequent rounds of polymerization . Srv2 / CAP also harbors two proline - rich motifs and has been suggested to interact with profilin . However , the mechanism and biological role of the possible profilin - Srv2 / CAP interaction has not been investigated . Here , we show that Saccharomyces cerevisiae Srv2 and profilin interact directly ( K D ~ 1 . 3 (cid:2) M ) and demonstrate that a specific proline - rich motif in Srv2 mediates this interaction in vitro and in vivo . ADP - actin monomers and profilin do not interfere with each other’s binding to Srv2 , suggesting that these three proteins can form a ternary complex . Genetic and cell biological analyses on an Srv2 allele ( srv2 - 201 ) defective in binding profilin reveals that a direct interaction with profilin is not essential for Srv2 cellular function . However , srv2 - 201 causes a moderate increase in cell size and partially suppresses the cell growth and actin organization defects of an actin binding mutant profilin ( pfy1 - 4 ) . Together these data suggest that Srv2 is an important physiological interaction partner of profilin .

Recent study also revealed that Srv2 links actin dynamics and Ras signaling during apoptosis ( Gourlay and Ayscough , 2006 ) . However , the adenylyl cyclase binding activity does not appear to be conserved in animals and plants , whereas its role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton is conserved in all Srv2 or CAP proteins tested so far ( Hubberstey and Mottillo , 2002 ) . Srv2 / CAP has been demonstrated to be a part of a multimeric complex that recycles actin monomers from ADF / cofilins , making them available for new rounds of filament assembly ( Moriyama and Yahara , 2002 ; Balcer et al . , 2003 ; Bertling et al . , 2004 ) . In budding yeast , the native Srv2 complex oligomerizes apparently as a hexamer with each Srv2 molecule capable of binding to one actin monomer ( Balcer et al . , 2003 ) . Deletion of the SRV2 gene in yeast results in abnormally large cell size , random budding pattern , and defects in actin distribution ( Gerst et al . , 1991 ; Votjek et al . , 1991 ) . The role of Srv2 or CAP in regulating the actin cytoskeleton is conserved in a wide range of eukaryotes : Srv2 or CAP defective cells have severe abnormalities in actin organization in Dictyostelium discoideum , Drosophila , plants and mammals ( Gottwald et al . , 1996 ; Noegel et al . , 1999 ; Baum et al . , 2000 ; Benlali et al . , 2000 ; Barrero et al . , 2002 ; Bertling et al . , 2004 ) . In addition , mutations that specifically disrupt actin monomer binding by yeast Srv2 cause defects in cell morphology and actin organization , demonstrating that G - actin binding plays a crucial role in Srv2 function in vivo ( Mattila et al . , 2004 ) . Srv2 harbors two conserved proline - rich regions and based on high - throughput yeast two - hybrid screens and biochemical studies using synthetic peptides it has been proposed that Srv2 may interact with profilin ( Drees et al . , 2001 ; Lambrechts et al . , 1997 ) . However , the mechanism of this potential interaction and its role in actin dynamics has not been investigated . Here , we demonstrate that yeast Srv2 directly interacts with profilin and we have mapped the binding interfaces of these proteins . Furthermore , co - immunoprecipitation of Srv2 and profilin from cell extracts and genetic analyses with an srv2 mutant that specifically disrupts profilin - binding demonstrate that the Srv2 - profilin interaction occurs in vivo and contributes to the regulation of cellular actin organization . Results Yeast Srv2 interacts directly with profilin To examine whether yeast Srv2 interacts with profilin , we expressed and purified its C - terminal half ( Srv2 253 - 526 ) . This Srv2 fragment contains the complete actin - binding site of the protein ( Mattila et al . , 2004 ) and two proline - rich regions ( P1 and P2 ) suggested to be involved in profilin interactions . Interaction of this Srv2 fragment with profilin was examined by a supernatant depletion pull - down assay in which the ability of bead - immobilized GST - Srv2 253 - 526 to deplete profilin from the supernatant was measured . The assay was carried out at physiological salt concentration and pH 7 . 5 , and the average values of five independent experiments are shown in Fig . 1B . Wild - type Srv2 253 - 526 efficiently decreased the amount of profilin remaining in the supernatant , suggesting that these two proteins directly interact in vitro ( Fig . 1A , B ) . Profilin interacts with proline - rich sequence motifs and its binding to these motifs can be disrupted by mutating specific aromatic residues that are highly conserved on the surface of profilin ( Wolven et al . , 2000 ; Lu and Pollard , 2001 ) . We next examined the interaction of Srv2 253 - 526 with a mutant yeast profilin ( Pfy1 - 14 ) that harbours tyrosine - to - alanine substitutions at residues 119 and 125 and consequently has markedly reduced affinity for proline - rich sequences compared with wild - type profilin ( Wolven et al . , 2000 ) . Supernatant depletion pull - down assays revealed that Pfy1 - 14 does not bind Srv2 253 - 526 with a detectable affinity , suggesting that the proline - rich region ( s ) of Srv2 play an essential role in this interaction ( Fig . 1A , B ) . A tryptophan fluorescence assay was applied for determining the dissociation constant of the Srv2 - profilin interaction . In order to diminish the background fluorescence Journal of Cell Science 120 ( 7 ) Fig . 1 . Srv2 binds directly to profilin ( K D = 1 . 3 (cid:2) M ) . ( A ) Profilin binding to GST - Srv2 253 - 526 on glutathione agarose beads measured by supernatant depletion pull - down assays . Reactions contained 2 (cid:2) M wild - type profilin ( Pfy1 ) or mutant profilin with impaired binding to polyproline ( Pfy1 - 14 ) and variable concentrations of Srv2 ( 0 - 20 (cid:2) M ) . The amount of Pfy1 in the supernatant was examined by SDS gel electrophoresis . First lane , no beads ; second lane , control - beads ; lanes 3 - 6 , 3 , 6 , 12 and 20 (cid:2) M Srv2 immobilized on beads . ( B ) Quantification of five independent pull - down assays comparing Pfy1 with Pfy1 - 14 . Srv2 efficiently depleted Pfy1 from the supernatant , but failed to deplete Pfy1 - 14 . Standard deviations are indicated with error bars . ( C ) Tryptophan fluorescence assay for determining the dissociation constant of the Srv2 - profilin complex . Reactions contained 1 (cid:2) M profilin . Pfy1 binds to Srv2 253 - 373 with a K D of 1 . 3 (cid:2) M , whereas Pfy1 - 14 shows no detectable affinity for Srv2 253 - 373 . J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e 1227 Interaction of Srv2 with profilin from Srv2 , we purified an Srv2 fragment corresponding to residues 253 - 373 . This segment includes both proline - rich regions but does not contain any tryptophan or tyrosine residues . Titration of Srv2 253 - 373 ( 0 - 15 (cid:2) M ) binding to profilin ( 1 (cid:2) M ) yielded a K D of 1 . 3 (cid:2) M for the interaction ( Fig . 1C ) . Consistent with results from the supernatant depletion pull - down assay described above , Pfy1 - 14 did not bind to Srv2 with detectable affinity in the tryptophan fluorescent assay ( Fig . 1C ) . Profilin binds to the first proline - rich motif ( P1 ) of Srv2 Profilin binds to proline - rich target motifs ( Tanaka and Shibata , 1985 ; Witke , 2004 ) , two of which are found in Srv2 / CAP ( P1 and P2 , Fig . 2A ) . A mutant profilin with defects in binding polyproline ( Pfy1 - 14 ) failed to interact with Srv2 ( Fig . 1 ) , suggesting that polyproline regions in Srv2 are required for binding profilin . Therefore , we introduced mutations designed to disrupt P1 and P2 separately in Srv2 . Three and two proline - to - alanine substitutions were introduced into P1 to generate srv2 - 201 and srv2 - 202 alleles , respectively . Three proline - to - alanine substitutions were introduced into P2 to generate srv2 - 203 ( Fig . 2A ) . Supernatant depletion assays carried out with Srv2 - 201 , Srv2 - 202 , and Srv2 - 203 GST - fusion proteins demonstrated that Srv2 - 203 , which contains mutations in P2 , bound to profilin with a similar affinity to wild - type Srv2 . Interestingly , Srv2 - 201 and Srv - 202 , in which P1 was mutated , showed no detectable binding to profilin in this assay ( Fig . 2B ) . Binding of Srv2 - 201 to profilin was also examined by tryptophan fluorescence assay using a shorter fragment of Srv2 - 201 corresponding to residues 253 - 373 . High concentrations of this fragment induced only a small increase in tryptophan fluorescence , suggesting non - saturable , low - affinity binding ( estimated K D greater than 20 (cid:2) M ) . This provides further evidence that the P1 region of Srv2 is essential for profilin binding . The first proline - rich region of Srv2 ( P1 ) is not involved in actin binding The C - terminal half of Srv2 binds ADP - G - actin with much higher affinity ( K D ~ 0 . 02 (cid:2) M ) than ATP - G - actin ( K D = 1 . 9 (cid:2) M ) ( Mattila et al . , 2004 ) . Mutational analysis showed that the actin - binding activity of yeast Srv2 is derived largely from the C - terminal (cid:3) - strand domain ( residues 396 - 526 ) with important additional contributions made by adjacent sequences ( residues 253 - 368 ) that contain P1 and P2 ( Mattila et al . , 2004 ) . To examine the role of Srv2 / CAP’s polyproline regions in actin binding , we carried out NBD - actin monomer binding assays to compare the ADP - G - actin binding affinities of wild - type , Srv2 - 201 , Srv2 - 202 , and Srv2 - 203 proteins under physiological ionic conditions . In these assays , we used Srv2 fragments corresponding to residues 253 - 526 as described previously ( Mattila et al . , 2004 ) . NBD - actin assays showed that Srv2 - 203 , containing mutations in P2 , binds to ADP - G - actin with a similar affinity to wild - type Srv2 . Interestingly , the affinity of Srv2 - 202 for ADP - G - actin was only 10 % of that of wild - type Srv2 , whereas Srv2 - 201 actin - binding was not affected ( Fig . 3 ) . These data suggest that neither one of the proline - rich regions is directly involved in actin binding , but that introducing two proline - to - alanine substitutions in P1 may induce a conformational change in the Srv2 polypeptide that affects interactions of the nearby (cid:3) - strand domain ( residues 396 - 526 ) with ADP - G - actin . Most importantly , these assays Fig . 2 . The P1 polyproline sequence is required for Srv2 binding to profilin . ( A ) Sequence alignment of the two mouse Srv2 / CAP isoforms ( CAP1 and CAP2 ) and yeast Srv2 . Positions of the proline - to - alanine substitutions in Srv2 - 201 , Srv2 - 202 and Srv2 - 203 mutants are indicated below the sequences . ( B ) Quantification of four independent supernatant depletion pull - down assays . Wild - type Srv2 and Srv2 - 203 bind profilin efficiently , whereas Srv2 - 201 and Srv2 - 202 fail to bind profilin in this assay . Standard deviations are indicated by error bars . ( C ) Tryptophan fluorescence assay of wild - type Srv2 253 - 373 and mutant Srv2 - 201 253 - 373 . Wild - type Srv2 253 - 373 but not Srv2 - 201 253 - 373 induces a saturable increase in tryptophan fluorescence of 1 (cid:2) M profilin . J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e 1228 show that Srv2 - 201 ( three proline - to - alanine substitutions in P1 ) displays severe defects in binding profilin but binds to G - actin with wild - type affinity . Srv2 can simultaneously interact with actin and profilin If the binding sites of two proteins overlap on a mutual ligand , they typically interfere with each other’s binding interactions with the ligand . Sometimes binding of one protein also alters the conformation of the ligand and thus changes the affinity of the ligand for other proteins . We thus telabested whether the C - terminal half of Srv2 ( 253 - 526 ) can bind simultaneously to both profilin and G - actin , or whether these two proteins interfere with each other’s binding to Srv2 . To examine the effects of profilin on Srv2 binding to actin , we monitored the fluorescence change of Srv2 - bound 0 . 2 (cid:2) M NBD - labeled actin . Addition of 1 (cid:2) M Srv2 253 - 526 induced an ~ 30 % increase in the NBD fluorescence owing to the interaction between ADP - G - actin and Srv2 253 - 526 . Titration of the reaction with 0 . 2 - 40 (cid:2) M wild - type profilin did not significantly decrease the fluorescence , suggesting that even in the presence of 80 - fold molar excess of profilin , the majority of Srv2 253 - 526 was still bound to actin . Importantly , previous studies showed that , in contrast to Srv2 , profilin does not bind ADP - actin with high affinity ( reviewed by Pollard et al . , 2000 ) . In addition , it was reported that NBD labelling of actin decreases its affinity to profilin ( Malm , 1984 ) . Thus , profilin does not significantly compete with Srv2 for ADP - G - actin binding in these assays . The same assay was also carried out with Srv2 - 201 , which binds to actin with normal affinity but is defective in profilin binding . Titration of the Srv2 - 201 – ADP - G - actin complex yielded very similar results to those obtained with wild - type Srv2 , suggesting further that the small decrease in fluorescence of Srv2 – ADP - G - actin complexes after addition of high concentrations of profilin does not result from competitive interactions between profilin and actin for binding Srv2 ( Fig . 4A ) . We next carried out supernatant depletion pull - down assays to examine the ability of Srv2 to bind profilin in the presence of actin . GST - Srv2 253 - 526 bound to glutathione agarose beads efficiently decreased the concentration of profilin in the supernatant . Titration of the reaction with increasing amounts of purified ADP - G - actin did not cause a significant reduction in the amount of profilin depleted by Srv2 , suggesting that ADP - G - actin does not interfere with profilin binding to Srv2 . It is important to note that Srv2 has a very high affinity for ADP - G - actin ( K D ~ 0 . 02 (cid:2) M ) and thus 10 (cid:2) M ADP - G - actin is expected to saturate approximately half of the 20 (cid:2) M Srv2 molecules . Therefore , if actin interferes with profilin binding to Srv2 , one should observe a ~ 50 % decrease in the amount of depleted profilin in the presence of 10 (cid:2) M ADP - G - actin compared with reactions without actin . We also examined the pellet fractions of these reactions and found that both profilin and actin were present in the pellet ( data not shown ) . To confirm that profilin did not bind to Srv2 indirectly , through associations with ADP - actin , the same assay was carried out with Srv2 - 201 , which could not deplete profilin from the supernatant . In this case , addition of actin did not decrease the amount of profilin in the supernatant , and only actin was detected in the pellet fractions as analyzed by SDS gels ( Fig . 4B , and data not shown ) . Together , these experiments suggest that Srv2 , profilin and ADP - G - actin form a ternary complex in which profilin and ADP - G - actin bind to Srv2 through separate interactions . However , further work is required to confirm the presence of this complex and to reveal the stoichiometry of these proteins in the complex . Profilin interacts with Srv2 in vivo To test whether Srv2 and profilin also associate in vivo , we carried out a co - immunoprecipitation assay from wild - type ( SRV2 ) , srv2 - 201 and srv2 (cid:4) yeast cell lysates . Wild - type or mutant Srv2 proteins were immunoprecipitated with an antibody against Srv2 and the amount of profilin in the lysates was detected by using an anti - profilin antibody . This assay revealed that profilin co - immunoprecipitated with wild - type Srv2 . By contrast , only very small amounts of profilin were detected in immunoprecipitates from the srv2 - 201 strain and from the srv2 (cid:4) strain ( Fig . 5A ) . Srv2 localizes to patch - like structures that partially co - localize with cortical actin patches in wild - type yeast cells ( Gourlay and Ayscough , 2006 ) . Mutations in the Srv2 proline - rich region P2 were previously shown to affect the subcellular localization of this protein , as a result of disrupting molecular interactions with the actin - patch resident protein Abp1 ( Lila and Drubin , 1997 ) . We thus compared the localization of Srv2 protein in SRV2 and srv2 - 201 yeast strains ( which harbors mutations in the Srv2 proline - rich region P1 ) by immunofluorescence microscopy . In both strains , Srv2 localized to patch - like structures that partially overlapped with the cortical actin cytoskeleton ( Fig . 5B ) . Journal of Cell Science 120 ( 7 ) Fig . 3 . Interactions of wild - type Srv2 and mutants Srv2 - 201 , Srv2 - 202 and Srv2 - 203 with ADP - G - actin . An increase in the fluorescence of 0 . 2 (cid:2) M NDB - labeled G - actin was measured under physiological salt conditions at pH 8 . 0 . Dissociation constants were calculated from the binding curves . Srv2 , Srv2 - 201 and Srv2 - 203 bound to actin monomers with high affinity ( K D = 0 . 066 (cid:2) M , 0 . 056 (cid:2) M and 0 . 074 (cid:2) M , respectively ) , whereas Srv2 - 202 bound actin monomers with considerably lower affinity ( K D = 0 . 4 (cid:2) M ) . J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e 1229 Interaction of Srv2 with profilin Together , these data show that full - length Srv2 and profilin interact with each other in vivo and that the P1 polyproline motif is necessary for this interaction . However , unlike the P2 motif that is crucial for Srv2 localization , through an interaction with the SH3 domain of Abp1 ( Lila and Drubin , 1997 ; Balcer et al . , 2003 ) , the P1 motif does not contribute to the subcellular localization of Srv2 . Genetic evidence for an in vivo functional interaction between Srv2 and profilin Identification of an srv2 mutant allele ( Srv2 - 201 ) defective in binding profilin but with normal actin - binding interactions enabled us to examine the functional role of the Srv2 - profilin interaction in yeast cells . To facilitate this analysis , we integrated wild - type ( SRV2 ) and mutant ( srv2 - 201 ) alleles at the SRV2 locus of an srv2 (cid:4) yeast strain . These isogenic strains ( SRV2 , srv2 - 201 and srv2 (cid:4) ) were grown in parallel at different temperatures ( 25 , 30 and 37°C ) and compared for defects in cell growth , morphology , and actin cytoskeleton organization . At all temperatures , the srv2 (cid:4) strain showed reduced rates of cell growth compared with wild - type cells , as well as enlarged cell size and depolarized actin patches and cables ( not shown ) , consistent with previous studies ( Gerst et al . , 1991 ; Vojtek et al . , 1991 ) . By contrast , SRV2 and srv2 - 201 strains displayed indistinguishable rates of cell growth and actin cytoskeleton organization ( not shown ) . However , despite the absence of obvious defects in cell growth , the srv2 - 201 mutation caused a statistically significant increase in average cell size compared with the isogenic wild - type SRV2 strain , albeit not to the same extent as the srv2 (cid:4) mutation ( supplementary material Fig . S1 ) . These data show that the srv2 - profilin interaction is not crucial for cell growth , but makes a supportive contribution to Srv2 regulation of cell morphology . In addition , we tested the srv2 - 201 mutation for possible Fig . 4 . Actin and profilin do not interfere with each other’s binding to Srv2 . ( A ) The presence of profilin does not alter the affinity of Srv2 for G - actin . Addition of 1 (cid:2) M Srv2 or Srv2 - 201 to 0 . 2 (cid:2) M NBD - labeled ADP - G - actin resulted in a ~ 30 % increase in the fluorescence . Addition of profilin ( 0 - 40 (cid:2) M ) did not significantly reduce the NBD fluorescence signal , suggesting that profilin does not affect the binding of Srv2 or Srv2 - 201 to ADP - G - actin . Standard deviations are indicated by error bars . ( B ) Actin - binding does not change Srv2 affinity for profilin . Supernatant depletion pull - down assays were carried out with reactions containing 2 (cid:2) M profilin ; the average of five independent assays is shown . Lane 1 , profilin alone ; lanes 2 - 6 , 20 (cid:2) M GST - Srv2 on beads ; lanes 3 - 6 , variable concentrations of ADP - G - actin ( 1 , 2 , 4 , 10 (cid:2) M ) . Addition of ADP - G - actin does not change the amount of profilin in the supernatant , demonstrating that actin monomers do not interfere with Srv2 - profilin interaction . Results using Srv2 - 201 show that profilin does not bind indirectly to Srv2 through interaction with G - actin in this assay . Standard deviations are indicated by error bars . Fig . 5 . Srv2 interacts with profilin in vivo . ( A ) Immunoprecipitation of Srv2 with anti - Srv2 antibody was carried out from wild - type SRV2 , srv2 - 201 and srv2 (cid:4) yeast strains . The blot was probed with anti - profilin antibody and demonstrates specific co - immunoprecipitation of profilin with wild - type Srv2 . By contrast , only very small amounts of profilin were detected in immunoprecipitates from srv2 - 201 and srv2 (cid:4) cells . The amounts of profilin in cell lysates before co - immunoprecipitation are shown as a control . ( B ) Srv2 localizes in patch - like manner in SRV2 and srv2 - 201 cells . The Srv2 dots occasionally co - localize with cortical actin patches . J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e 1230 genetic interactions with pfy1 - 4 , cof1 - 19 , and aip1 (cid:4) mutations , each of which is synthetic lethal with srv2 (cid:4) ( Wolven et al . , 2000 ; Balcer et al . , 2003 ) . Interestingly , srv2 - 201 partially suppressed the growth defects caused by pfy1 - 4 , but showed no genetic interactions with cof1 - 19 or aip1 (cid:4) mutations , as determined by tetrad analysis and by carefully comparing the resulting single and double haploid mutant strains for cell growth at a range of temperatures ( Fig . 6A and data not shown ) . Thus , suppression of pfy1 - 4 growth defects by srv2 - 201 is a highly specific genetic interaction . As an independent test of this suppression , we transformed the double mutant strains pfy1 - 4 , srv2 - 201 and aip1 (cid:4) , srv2 - 201 with either a low copy wild - type SRV2 plasmid or empty vector . Transformed cells were serially diluted and compared for growth at a range of temperatures ( Fig . 6B ) . Consistent with the genetic results above , this assay showed that the defects caused by pfy1 - 4 are suppressed by srv2 - 201 , since the cells carrying the SRV2 plasmid were significantly more impaired for growth than cells carrying empty vector . Yeasts carrying mutations aip1 (cid:4) , srv2 - 201 did not show similar effects . Further , this suggests that Journal of Cell Science 120 ( 7 ) Fig . 6 . The srv2 - 201 allele suppresses defects in cell growth and actin organization caused by pfy1 - 4 . ( A ) Comparison of cell growth defects for progeny from a cross between pfy1 - 4 and srv2 - 201 strains . Diploids from this cross were sporulated , tetrads were dissected . Lethality of spores was scored on the tetrad plates . Viable haploid strains from these plates were re - plated on YPD and scored for cell growth at 25 and 37°C . n , number of haploid progeny with the indicated genotype analyzed . ( B ) Transformation assay showing that srv2 - 201 suppresses the growth defects of pfy1 - 4 . Double mutant pfy1 - 4 , srv2 - 201 cells were transformed with a low copy URA - marked empty vector ( pRS316 ) or p SRV2 ( pBG334 ) . Serial dilutions of transformed cells were plated on Ura – selective medium and grown at 25 , 30 , 34 and 37°C . As a control , double mutant aip1 , srv2 - 201 cells were transformed with same vectors . ( C ) Cells from A above were grown to log phase , chemically fixed and stained with Alexa Fluor 488 - phalloidin to label F - actin structures . ( D ) Quantitative comparison of actin patch polarization defects in pfy - 4 and pfy1 - 4 srv2 - 201 cells . Medium - budded cells ( n > 200 , each strain ) were scored for actin patch distribution in the bud . Actin patches were classified as being polarized , unpolarized or intermediate polarized . J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e 1231 Interaction of Srv2 with profilin physical interactions between Pfy1 - 4 and Srv2 lead to dominant negative effects in vivo ( see Discussion ) . A close examination of actin organization in these mutant strains revealed that srv2 - 201 partially rescues the actin patch polarization defects caused by the pfy1 - 4 mutation . Single mutant pfy1 - 4 cells exhibited greatly diminished actin cable staining and a highly depolarized distribution of actin patches , consistent with previous reports ( Wolven et al . , 2000 ) ; notably , there was no enrichment of actin patches in the bud ( Fig . 6C ; panels d and e ) . By contrast , srv2 - 201 pfy1 - 4 double mutant cells exhibited an enrichment of actin patches in the bud compared with pfy1 - 4 cells ( Fig . 6C ; panels i and j ) . These effects were scored , comparing the number of medium - budded pfy1 - 4 cells and pfy1 - 4 srv2 - 201 cells showing polarized , partially polarized , or completely unpolarized actin patch distribution ( Fig . 6D ) . Thus , the partial suppression of pfy1 - 4 growth defects by srv2 - 201 correlates with partial restoration of actin polarization . Interestingly , restoration of visible actin cables was not observed in pfy1 - 4 srv2 - 201 cells . This suggests that the profilin - Srv2 functional interaction may specifically influence actin patches . Discussion Srv2 / CAP is a highly abundant protein that binds actin monomers and ADF / cofilin ( Mattila et al . , 2004 ; Moriyama and Yahara , 2002 ) to promote the rapid actin filament turnover in cells ( Balcer et al . , 2003 ; Bertling et al . , 2004 ) . In addition to actin and ADF / cofilin , Srv2 / CAP has been proposed to interact physically with profilin ( Lambrechts et al . , 1997 ; Drees et al . , 2001 ; Balcer et al . , 2003 ) . Further , an Srv2 - profilin functional interaction was suggested by earlier studies showing that defects arising from truncation of the yeast Srv2 C - terminus are partially suppressed by overexpression of profilin ( Votjek et al . , 1991 ) . However , the mechanism and biological role of this possible Srv2 - profilin interaction has not been demonstrated so far . In this study , we used Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model organism to examine this interaction and revealed that : ( 1 ) Srv2 binds directly to profilin ( K D = 1 . 3 (cid:2) M ) in vitro ; ( 2 ) The profilin - binding site is located in the first proline - rich region ( P1 ) of Srv2 ; ( 3 ) Profilin and ADP - G - actin can bind simultaneously to the C - terminus of Srv2 ; ( 4 ) The Srv2 - profilin interaction also occurs in vivo , but is not essential for Srv2 function in yeast cells . Nevertheless , Srv2 interaction with profilin participates in regulating actin organization and cell morphology , as revealed by the ability of srv2 - 201 to partially suppress the defects of pfy1 - 4 . Previously , Lambrechts et al . ( Lambrechts et al . , 1997 ) applied fluorescence spectroscopy to examine the interaction between mammalian profilin I and a 15 - residue - long synthetic peptide corresponding to P1 of mammalian CAP1 . These studies defined an interaction with a K D of approximately 5 (cid:2) M . This affinity is approximately four times lower than measured here using a 120 - residue yeast Srv2 fragment , suggesting either that yeast Srv2 binds to profilin with higher affinity than the mammalian protein or that sequences adjacent to the polyproline motif affect the binding interaction with profilin . It remains to be shown , whether this affinity is the same or even higher with full - length protein . It was previously shown that in vitro ten proline residues is the optimal length of a polyproline peptide for binding profilin ( Perelroizen et al . , 1994 ) . The P1 motif in yeast Srv2 spans eleven residues , of which nine are prolines . By contrast , P2 spans eight residues , of which five are prolines ( see Fig . 2A ) . Our experiments showed that profilin binding to Srv2 requires P1 , whereas P2 does not contribute to profilin binding . This is in good agreement with previous studies demonstrating the importance of P2 for interactions with the SH3 domain of Abp1 ( Freeman et al . , 1996 ; Lila and Drubin , 1997 ; Balcer et al . , 2003 ) . Together , these data suggest that P1 defines the profilin - binding site on Srv2 ( and is thus not required for localization of Srv2 in cells ) , while P2 binds to Abp1 and other SH3 domain proteins that control the localization of Srv2 in cells . One unexpected result from our study was that some , but not all mutations in P1 impair binding of Srv2 to actin . Proline - rich regions are known to form a helix - like structure containing approximately three prolines per turn . Srv2 - 201 , which has three proline - to - alanine substitutions ( amino acids 278 - 280 ) , showed a severe defect in profilin - binding but interacted with actin with wild - type affinity . This suggests that in Srv2 - 201 replacing a ‘full turn’ of prolines in the helix retains a functional conformation similar to wild - type Srv2 . However , in Srv2 - 202 the two proline - to - alanine substitutions might have disrupted the register of the helix and thereby resulted in decreased affinity for ADP - G - actin . These data suggest that in the three - dimensional structure of Srv2 , the profilin - and actin - binding sites may be in close proximity , making it possible that the Srv2 - bound profilin and actin monomer can also interact with each other . This possibility is further supported by our previous mutational analysis demonstrating that the C - terminal (cid:3) - sheet structure ( residues 369 - 526 ) is sufficient to bind actin but its affinity for actin is greatly enhanced by adjacent sequences N - terminal to this domain ( Mattila et al . , 2004 ) . However , it is important to note that although these binding sites may be located close to each other in the three - dimensional structure of Srv2 , our studies suggest that profilin and ADP - G - actin can bind simultaneously to Srv2 . Deletion of the SRV2 gene in budding yeast results in impaired cell growth , enlargement of cell size , and severe depolarization of cortical actin patches ( Gerst et al . , 1991 ; Votjek et al . , 1991 ) . Similar phenotypes were also detected from yeast cells expressing mutant Srv2 proteins with defects in ADP - G - actin binding , demonstrating that the Srv2 interaction with actin monomers is essential for Srv2 function in vivo ( Mattila et al . , 2004 ) . Our co - immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that Srv2 interacts with profilin in vivo . Interestingly , studies with a mutant Srv2 impaired specifically in binding profilin ( srv2 - 201 ) revealed first that this interaction is not essential for Srv2 cellular functions . The srv2 - 201 cells grew at wild - type rates at a range of temperatures and did not display detectable defects in actin cytoskeleton organization at the light microscopy level . On the other hand , srv2 - 201 cells were enlarged compared with wild - type cells , indicating that direct interactions between Srv2 and profilin must contribute to Srv2 function in maintaining polarized cell growth . Further , we showed that a profilin mutant ( pfy1 - 4 ) with defective actin binding interactions but normal affinity for polyproline is compromised in vivo by its direct interactions with Srv2 . This was indicated by the ability of srv2 - 201 to partially suppress the cell growth defects of pfy1 - 4 . Together , these genetic data indicate that Srv2 is an important physiological target of profilin . One explanation for the ability of srv2 - 201 to suppress pfy1 - 4 defects is that in cells expressing wild - type Srv2 , Pfy1 - J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e 1232 4 molecules ( with reduced actin - binding affinity ) may become sequestered on Srv2 in a dominant negative fashion , and thereby diminish the pool of Pfy1 - 4 molecules available to deliver actin monomers to the growing barbed ends of filaments . In this case , disrupting the profilin binding site on Srv2 ( srv2 - 201 ) would liberate Pfy1 - 4 molecules to perform their role in actin filament growth . Importantly , this does not rule out other possible explanations . However , regardless of the exact mechanism underlying these effects , this genetic interaction demonstrates that the Srv2 - profilin interaction occurs in vivo ( supported further by Srv2 and profilin co - immunoprecipitation ) and can strongly affect the polarization of actin patches and cell growth . Given that the P1 motif is highly conserved in Srv2 / CAP homologues , these profilin - Srv2 / CAP interactions are likely to make similar contributions to actin dynamics in other organisms . Together with previously reported observations , our new data on the Srv2 - profilin interaction supports the following model for how Srv2 / CAP regulates actin dynamics . ADF / cofilin severs actin filaments and promotes dissociation of ADP - G - actin monomers from filament pointed ends ( Bamburg , 1999 ) and the N - terminus of Srv2 / CAP binds to ADF / cofilin – G - actin complexes ( Moriyama and Yahara , 2002 ) . Srv2 / CAP forms a high molecular weight multimeric complex with G - actin ( Balcer et al . , 2003 ) , which in yeast localizes to the cortical actin cytoskeleton through interactions with the actin filament binding protein Abp1 ( Freeman et al . , 1995 ; Lila and Drubin , 1997 ) . We propose that following the interaction of the N - terminus of Srv2 / CAP with ADF / cofilin – G - actin , ADP - actin dissociates from cofilin and is transferred to the C - terminal actin - binding domain of Srv2 / CAP ( Mattila et al . , 2004 ) . This transfer may occur either in cis ( within the same Srv2 molecule ) or in trans ( between two different Srv2 / CAP molecules in the same complex ) . Because the profilin - and actin - binding sites are predicted to be adjacent in the three - dimensional structure of Srv2 / CAP ( see above ) , we propose that the Srv2 / CAP - bound ADP - actin monomer next interacts with profilin . Some combination of these interactions ( profilin and Srv2 / CAP with ADP - actin ) stimulates nucleotide exchange to produce ATP - G - actin . It was previously shown that Srv2 and profilin have additive biochemical effects in promoting nucleotide exchange in vitro ( Balcer et al . , 2003 ) . Owing to the low affinity of Srv2 / CAP for ATP - G - actin ( K D = 1 . 9 (cid:2) M ) , the profilin - actin monomer complex rapidly dissociates from Srv2 / CAP and becomes available for filament barbed end assembly . However , it is important to note that our genetic studies revealed that the interaction with profilin is not essential for yeast Srv2 function in vivo . Thus , we speculate that the actin monomer can also be recycled from Srv2 / CAP to profilin if profilin is not directly bound to Srv2 / CAP , but that the direct interaction between Srv2 / CAP and profilin increases the efficiency of this process . Previous studies have shown that many proteins contain proline - rich motifs that interact with profilin , used to recruit ATP - actin - profilin complexes to specific sites and promote filament barbed end growth ( e . g . Reinhard et al . , 1995 ; Suetsugu et al . , 1998 ; Evangelista et al . , 2003 ) . Our study reveals that proline - rich sequence motifs can also be used for a different function , loading profilin molecules onto actin monomers and thus replenishing the assembly - competent actin monomer pool . In the future it will be important to elucidate whether this function is also conserved in Srv2 / CAP proteins of other organisms as well as to gain structural information of the Srv2 / CAP – profilin – actin - monomer complex . Materials and Methods Plasmid constructs , mutant integration , and genetic analyses For expression as glutathione - S - transferase ( GST ) fusion proteins , SRV2 DNA fragments encoding amino acid residues 253 - 526 ( pPL143 ) or 253 - 373 ( pPL241 ) were cloned to pGAT2 vector ( Peränen et al . , 1996 ) using Nco I and Hin dIII sites at the 5 (cid:5) and 3 (cid:5) ends as described ( Mattila et al . , 2004 ) . Specific mutations were introduced into these fragments to generate plasmids pPL267 ( srv2 - 201 ) , pPL339 ( srv2 - 201 residues 253 - 373 ) , pPL268 ( srv2 - 202 ) and pPL266 ( srv2 - 203 ) . A mutant allele of yeast profilin ( pfy1 - 14 ) defective in polyproline binding ( Wolven et al . , 2000 ) was cloned into the pBAT4 vector ( pPL338 ) for expression in E . coli ( Peränen et al . , 1996 ) . To generate yeast strains BGY1190 and BGY1191 , an integration plasmid was constructed carrying the SRV2 coding region plus 492 bp upstream and 496 bp downstream sequences . The TRP1 gene was inserted 54 bp downstream of the SRV2 stop codon to generate pBG652 . From this template , the srv2 - 201 mutant allele was generated by QuikChange site - directed mutagenesis ( Stratagene ; Cedar Creek , TX ) . All plasmids were sequenced . Wild - type and mutant SRV2 : : TRP1 alleles were integrated at the SRV2 locus in the haploid yeast strain BGY330 ( Mat (cid:6) , his3 (cid:4) 200 , leu2 - 3 , 112 , ura3 - 52 , trp1 - 1 , lys2 - 801 , srv2 (cid:4) : : HIS3 ) , replacing srv2 (cid:4) : : HIS3 . Integration at the correct locus was confirmed by PCR analysis of isolated genomic DNA . Genetic interactions with pfy1 - 4 , aip1 (cid:4) and cof1 - 19 mutations were tested by crossing haploid srv2 - 201 and SRV2 strains to each of the following strains : ( 1 ) Mat a , his3 (cid:4) 200 , leu2 - 3 , 112 , ura3 - 52 , trp1 - 1 , lys2 - 801 , pfy1 - 4 : : LEU2 ; ( 2 ) Mat a , his3 (cid:4) 200 , leu2 - 3 , 112 , ura3 - 52 , trp1 - 1 , lys2 - 801 , aip1 (cid:4) : : URA3 ; ( 3 ) Mat a , his3 (cid:4) 200 , leu2 - 3 , 112 , ura3 - 52 , trp1 - 1 , lys2 - 801 , cof1 - 19 : : LEU2 . Diploids were selected and then sporulated , tetrads were dissected and resulting haploids ( wild type , single mutants and double mutants ) were serially diluted and compared for growth on YPD plates at 25 , 30 , 34 and 37°C . Protein expression and purification All Srv2 fragments and profilins used in this study were expressed and purified using the E . coli BL - 21 ( DE3 ) strain . Wild - type and mutant fragments of the Srv2 C - terminal region ( 253 - 526 and 253 - 373 ) were purified as GST fusions as previously described ( Mattila et al . , 2004 ) . In all cases except for supernatant depletion pull - down assays , the GST - tag was removed by thrombin cleavage . Wild - type Pfy1 ( pBG073 ) and mutant Pfy1 - 14 ( pPL338 ) were purified as described ( Wolven et al . , 2000 ) . Rabbit muscle actin was prepared from acetone powder ( Pardee and Spudich , 1982 ) . Actin monomer binding assay Rabbit muscle actin was labeled with NBD ( 7 - chloro - 4 - nitrobenz - 2 - oxa - 1 , 3 - diazole - Cl ) as described ( Detmers et al . , 1981 ) . ATP - actin was converted to ADP - actin by incubation with hexokinase - agarose beads for 2 hours at + 4°C ( Pollard , 1986 ) . Hexokinase - agarose beads were prepared by coupling pure hexokinase ( Sigma ) to CNBr - activated Sepharose 4B beads ( Amersham Biosciences AB , Sweden ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Binding of wild - type and mutant C - terminal Srv2 proteins Srv2 - 201 , Srv2 - 202 and Srv2 - 203 to actin was measured by change in fluorescence of NBD - actin ( excitation and emission wavelengths of 482 nm and 535 nm , respectively ) . Binding reactions [ total volume 100 (cid:2) l , reaction buffer 2 mM Tris - HCl pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 100 mM KCl , 0 . 1 mM DTT , 0 . 2 mM ADP , 1 mg / ml Bovine serum albumin ( Sigma ) ] contained a constant concentration of actin ( 0 . 2 (cid:2) M ) and variable concentrations of other proteins and were carried out at room temperature . Data were collected with BioLogic MOS250 fluorometer ( Claix , France ) and fitted and analyzed using SigmaPlot 9 . 0 software ( Systat Software , USA ) and equations as described ( Mattila et al . , 2004 ) . Tryptophan fluorescence assay Interactions between yeast profilin ( 1 (cid:2) M ) and Srv2 253 - 373 or Srv2 - 201 253 - 373 ( 0 to 15 (cid:2) M ) were measured by change in profilin tryptophan fluorescence at excitation and emission wavelengths of 295 nm and 350 nm , respectively . These shorter fragments of Srv2 were prepared to diminish Srv2 background tryptophan fluorescence . The background Srv2 fluorescence values ( without profilin ) were subtracted from the fluorescence values of Srv2 - profilin samples to obtain the fluorescence changes resulting from Srv2 - profilin interactions . All reactions were carried out in a sample volume of 100 (cid:2) l in the following buffer : 30 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 5 , 100 mM NaCl . The fluorescence was recorded after a 20 - minute incubation at room temperature . Binding constants were measured from the curves as described above for actin monomer binding assays . Supernatant depletion pull - down assays For these assays , GST - fusions of wild - type and mutant Srv2 fragments were produced in E . coli . Cells were lysed and GST - fusion proteins were bound to Journal of Cell Science 120 ( 7 ) J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e 1233 Interaction of Srv2 with profilin glutathione - Sepharose 4B beads ( Amersham Biosciences AB , Sweden ) as described ( Mattila et al . , 2004 ) . Beads containing GST or beads only washed with reaction buffer were used as a control . Total amount of protein bound to the beads was estimated from Coomassie stained SDS - PAGE gels . Reactions of 250 (cid:2) l were prepared in 30 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 5 , 100 - 150 mM NaCl with a constant final concentration of profilin ( 2 (cid:2) M ) and variable ( 0 to 20 (cid:2) M ) concentrations of wild - type and mutant Srv2 immobilized on beads . After 20 min incubation at room temperature , the samples were centrifuged at 13 , 000 g for 5 minutes to pellet Srv2 - beads and bound profilin . Amount of unbound profilin remaining in the supernatant was examined on Coomassie stained 15 % SDS - PAGE gels and quantified using TINA software . Binding interference assays The ability of profilin to interfere with Srv2 binding to G - actin was measured in an applied NBD - actin fluorescence assay . All samples were prepared as described above for except that the concentrations of actin ( 0 . 2 (cid:2) M ) and Srv2 ( 1 (cid:2) M ) were constant and profilin concentration was varied ( 0 to 40 (cid:2) M ) . Data was collected and analyzed as above . The stability of the Srv2 - profilin association in the presence of G - actin was measured and analyzed by a modified version of that described above using 2 (cid:2) M profilin in the supernatant , 20 (cid:2) M Srv2 on beads and a variable concentration of ADP - actin ( 0 to 10 (cid:2) M ) . The assay was carried out in 2 mM Tris - HCl pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 1 mM DTT , 0 . 2 mM ADP , 50 mM NaCl . Co - immunoprecipitation The co - immunoprecipitation assay from SRV2 , srv2 - 201 and srv2 (cid:4) strains was carried out as described ( Falck et al . , 2004 ) . Proteins were examined by western blotting as described previously ( Vartiainen et al . , 2003 ) . The antibodies against yeast Srv2 , profilin and actin were generated in chicken , mouse and guinea - pig , respectively . Microscopy To visualize filamentous actin organization in cells , yeast were grown in liquid culture to early log phase ( OD 600 = 0 . 1 ) then fixed with formaldehyde , washed and stained with Alexa Fluor 488 phalloidin ( Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR ) . Images were captured on a Zeiss Axioskop2 mot plus ( Carl Zeiss , Thornwood , NY ) using a Hamamatsu IEEE1394 digital CCD camera ( Hamamatsu Photonics , Bridgewater , NJ ) . Image analysis was performed using Openlab TM software ( Improvision , Lexington , MA ) . For analysis of cell size , DIC images of non - fixed cells ( OD 600 = 0 . 1 ) were captured using the instrumentation described above . With system software , unbudded cells and mother cell compartments of budded cells were traced and the area within each compartment was computed . For each strain , at least 250 cells were analyzed . Analysis of cell growth SRV2 , srv2 - 201 and srv2 (cid:4) strains were directly compared for rates of cell growth at 30°C and 37°C . Cell cultures grown in YPD liquid media were maintained in log phase ( OD 600 < 0 . 5 ) for 12 hours , during which time aliquots of cells were removed and counted by cytometry and plated on YPD to determine cell viability as colony forming units . All assays were performed in duplicate . This study was supported by grants from Academy of Finland and Emil Aaltonen Foundation to P .
