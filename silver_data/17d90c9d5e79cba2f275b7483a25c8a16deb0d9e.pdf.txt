However , a notable limitation of TSI models is their primary reliance on incidence data . Even when hospitalization data are available , existing TSI models have not been crafted to estimate disease transmission or predict disease - related hospitalizations - metrics crucial for understanding a pandemic and planning hospital resources . Moreover , their dependence on reported infection data makes them vulnerable to variations in data quality . In this study , we advance TSI models by integrating hospitalization data , marking a significant step forward in modeling with TSI models . Our improvements enable the estimation of key infectious disease parameters without relying on contact tracing data , reduce bias in incidence data , and provide a foundation to connect TSI models with other infectious disease models . We introduce hospitalization propensity parameters to jointly model incidence and hospitalization data . We use a composite likelihood function to accommodate complex data structure and an MCEM algorithm to estimate model parameters . We apply our method to COVID - 19 data to estimate disease transmission , assess risk factor impacts , and calculate hospitalization propensity . ∗ To whom correspondence should be addressed . a r X i v : 2403 . 12243v1 [ s t a t .

Introduction Mathematical modeling plays a crucial role in comprehending infectious disease transmission . By estimating essential transmission parameters , predicting epidemic trends , and enabling real - time comparisons of response strategies , quantitative models transform information about disease processes into actionable statistics . In the early stages of novel pandemics , when vaccines and treatments are unavailable , and the entire population lacks immunity , policymakers often rely on a selected set of key statistics to make timely and effective decisions . These statistics in - clude but are not limited to , the effective reproduction number ( R t ) , projected incidence counts , projected hospitalization counts , and the impact of intervenable factors . A plethora of model - ing approaches have been developed to estimate these statistics , particularly in response to the COVID - 19 pandemic , each with its unique advantages and limitations . These models encompass a range of methodologies , including compartmental models , agent - based simulations , time - series analyses , and network - based approaches . Within this field , one noteworthy category is the Time Since Infection ( TSI ) models . The concept of Time since Infection ( TSI ) models can be traced back to the work of Ross and Hudson in the 1910s Ross ( 1916 ) ; Ross and Hudson ( 1917 a , b ) . Their mathematical basis was described in a seminal paper by Kermack and McKendrick in 1927 Kermack and McKendrick ( 1927 ) and was formally formulated and gained more prominence with Wallinga’s work in 2004 and Fraser’s contributions in 2007 Wallinga and Teunis ( 2004 ) ; Fraser ( 2007 ) . The models then gained further recognition in the statistics community following Cori’s work in 2013 Cori and others ( 2013 ) . Thanks to Cori’s development of an R package named EpiEstim Cori ( 2021 ) , these models have been increasingly employed to estimate real - time disease transmission rates over the past decade . During the COVID - 19 pandemic , TSI models were extensively used to analyze the TSI model for Hospitalization and Incidence Data 3 pandemic ( Pan and others , 2020 ; Nouvellet and others , 2021 ; Amman and others , 2022 ; Nash and others , 2022 ; Ge and others , 2023 ) and demonstrated superior accuracy in estimating R t compared to many other methods ( Gostic and others , 2020 ; Nash and others , 2022 ) . Moreover , building upon the original TSI models , researchers have proposed several enhancements that either relax model assumptions or address challenges with real data . These improvements include integrating TSI models with regression models , addressing reporting delays and underreporting , refining the estimation of serial interval distributions , and enabling the simultaneous analysis of multiple locations , among other innovations ( Wilder and others , 2021 ; Salas , 2021 ; Quick and others , 2021 ; Shi and others , 2022 ; Ge and others , 2023 ) . The TSI models are designed around the premise that the number of new infections at a particular moment is influenced by three primary factors : the count of recent infections , the reproduction number at that moment , and an infectiousness function that measures the conta - giousness of an infected person at each time since infection . For illustration , consider discrete time by day and let I t represent the number of newly infected individuals on day t . If we know the num - ber of infections before day t , denoted by I 0 , . . . , I t − 1 , the expected number of new infections on day t is written as the multiplication of the instantaneous reproduction number and the infection potential on that particular day . This relationship can be expressed as E ( I t | I 0 , · · · , I t − 1 ) = R t Λ t , where Λ t ≜ (cid:80) t s = 1 I t − s ω s stands for the infection potential on day t . It is shaped by the current number of infectious individuals and the infectiousness function ω s , which quantifies the infec - tiousness of the existing infectious individuals on the s - th day after infection , with (cid:80) + ∞ s = 0 ω s = 1 . Practically , we can assume ω s = 0 for s = 0 and s > η with η being the duration between infection and recovery . This infectiousness function can be approximated using the probability distribution of the serial interval or generation time ( Svensson , 2007 ) . To estimate R t , one may assume distribution assumptions for I t and use methods like maximum likelihood or Bayesian approaches with predetermined values of ω s ( Cori and others , 2013 ; WHO Ebola Response Team , 4 J . Shi and others 2014 ; Quick and others , 2021 ) . Compared to other methods , TSI models stand out due to their practicality and flexibility . Being statistical in nature , the models can be integrated with advanced statistical structures , offering significant potential for modeling complex questions ( Quick and others , 2021 ; Shi and others , 2022 ; Nash and others , 2022 ) . The models are empirical , suggesting that they can be practically applied with a reasonable understanding of how available data are generated , even without a detailed epidemiological understanding of transmission characteristics ( Jewell , 2021 ) . This makes them highly useful for modeling outbreaks caused by novel infectious pathogens . Most notably , TSI models only require incidence data to estimate R t . This simplicity ensures the models are easy to estimate and remain user - friendly , even when other disease surveillance data are unavailable . This characteristic is particularly attractive during the early stages of pandemics when national disease surveillance systems are still developing . However , a significant weakness of the TSI model also stems from this reliance . Since they primarily rely on incidence data , even when hospital data become available , the original TSI models cannot model or predict disease - related hospitalizations , a crucial statistic for evaluating a pandemic’s trajectory and for hospital planning . Additionally , this reliance also makes the models susceptible to fluctuations in the quality of reported infection data . In this study , we focus on advancing the framework of TSI models by incorporating a critical yet overlooked aspect : the modeling of hospitalization data . This inclusion represents a signifi - cant step forward in infectious disease modeling using TSI models , with profound implications for both research and practical applications . Our motivation for this advancement is threefold . First , it enables the modeling of hospitalizations , an indispensable tool for managing healthcare resources during epidemics . As shown in our data application , the proposed method allows es - timation of key hospitalization related parameters without using contacting tracing data which are often difficult to obtain . Second , it helps reduce bias stemming from errors in incidence data , TSI model for Hospitalization and Incidence Data 5 leading to a more accurate representation of disease dynamics . Third , from a model development perspective , integrating both hospitalization and incidence data into the models could allow us to draw connections and unify the strengths of TSI models with other infectious disease models , such as compartmental models , given their common heritage . While the potential benefits of incorporating hospitalization data into TSI models are clear , the technical challenges posed by this endeavor are non - trivial . To jointly model incidence and hospitalization counts , we introduce a new set of parameters , similar to the infectiousness func - tion , named hospitalization propensity , ˜ ω s , which quantifies the tendency of infectious individuals being hospitalized on the s - th day after infection . These parameters can be approximated using the probability distribution of the time between disease onset and hospitalization , or they can be estimated directly from the proposed model . The relationship between the incidence data and the hospitalization data is then linked using the hospitalization propensity . However , specifying the joint likelihood function is challenging due to the complicated recurrence relation between incidence and hospitalization data . To address this , we propose using a composite likelihood function , providing a flexible and robust way to accommodate complex structures inherent in the hospitalization and incidence data . We develop an MCEM algorithm to estimate the model parameters and derive the asymptotic properties of the estimators . We evaluate the performance of our model through simulation studies and study its robustness by conducting sensitivity anal - yses in a range of scenarios of misspecified models . We apply the proposed methods to analyze county - level COVID - 19 daily confirmed infection counts , and hospitalization data across the U . S . in 2021 , estimating the reproductive numbers , and the impact of local - level risk factors on dis - ease transmission . In the following sections , we delve into the details of our novel TSI model , elucidating its key components and demonstrating its advantages through empirical analyses . Our goal is to contribute to the ongoing discourse in infectious disease modeling , offering a fresh perspective on leveraging hospitalization data to enhance our understanding of disease dynamics 6 J . Shi and others and strengthen public health efforts . 2 . Model 2 . 1 Model and Notations We use subscripts t to denote calendar time and s to indicate time since infection . By “hospital - ization” , we refer to hospital admission due to the infectious disease . Here , we consider discrete time . Let I t represent the number of new infections and H t denote the number of new hospitaliza - tions at time t . We define the filtrations F t = σ ( { I r , 0 ⩽ r ⩽ t } ) and G t = σ ( { I r , H r , 0 ⩽ r ⩽ t } ) which represent the information on past infections and the combined information on both past infections and hospitalizations , respectively . In line with the original TSI models , we assume the number of new infections at time t , given the number of previously infected individuals , follows a Poisson distribution : I t | F t − 1 ∼ Poisson ( R t Λ t ) , ( 2 . 1 ) Next , we denote h t , s as the number of patients infected at calendar time t and admitted at calendar time t + s , i . e . , time s since infection . We assume the hospitalization propensity of an infected individual , ˜ ω s , describes the tendency of infectious individuals to be hospitalized on the s - th time after infection and it is independent of the calendar time t . Then , the expected value of h t , s can be expressed as E ( h t , s | F t ) = ˜ ω s I t . In practice , we can assume that if an infected individual is not hospitalized within a certain period after their infection , their hospitalization propensity approaches zero . We then set h t , s = 0 and ˜ ω s = 0 for s > ˜ η for all t , where the positive integer ˜ η represents the duration from infection to the time after which the likelihood of hospitalization becomes negligible . We also define h t , − 1 as the total number of patients infected at time t who will never be hospitalized due to the infection and set the tendency ˜ ω − 1 = 1 − (cid:80) ˜ η s = 0 ˜ ω s . Thus , the total incidence at time t is equal to the sum of patients who were infected at calendar time t and admitted at time s since infection , plus those infected at calendar time t and never TSI model for Hospitalization and Incidence Data 7 hospitalized . The total hospitalizations at time t is the sum of patients who were infected at calendar time t − s and admitted at time s since infection . In this way , the relationship between disease incidence and hospitalization is connected through I t = h t , − 1 + (cid:88) s ⩾ 0 h t , s , and H t = t (cid:88) s = 0 h t − s , s , for t = 0 , 1 , 2 , · · · . ( 2 . 2 ) Based on the above setup , we further assume (cid:0) h t , − 1 , h t , 0 , · · · , h t , ˜ η (cid:1) | I t ∼ Multinomial (cid:0) I t , ˜ ω − 1 , ˜ ω 0 , · · · , ˜ ω ˜ η (cid:1) . ( 2 . 3 ) From Equations ( 2 . 2 ) and ( 2 . 3 ) , we can see that the time - series data of daily infections and hospitalizations exhibit deeply connected , crossover , and overlapping structures . This intricate relationship is illustrated in two plots , as shown in Figure 1 . Fig . 1 . The relationship between incidence data I t and hospitalization data H t . The left panel illustrates the relationship between calendar time 0 and 2 and time since infection from 0 to 2 . The right panel illustrates the relationship between calendar time i and i + 2 and time since infection from j to j + 2 . Furthermore , to model the impact of risk factors on R t , we draw inspiration from Shi and others ( 2022 ) ; Quick and others ( 2021 ) and Zeger and Qaqish ( 1988 ) to assume a regression 8 J . Shi and others structure in which : h ( R t ) = X Tt β + q (cid:88) i = 1 θ i f i ( D 1 , t , D 2 , t , D 3 , t ) , ( 2 . 4 ) where t ⩾ q > 0 and X t is a p - dimensional vector that includes a constant 1 and a vector of risk factors of disease transmission , Z t , such as temperature , social distancing measures , and population density . In this equation , h ( · ) and f i ( · ) represent a known link function and functions of past outcomes , respectively . Additionally , D 1 , t = (cid:8) X r (cid:9) 0 ⩽ r ⩽ t , D 2 , t = (cid:8) I r , E ( H r ) (cid:9) 0 ⩽ r ⩽ t − 1 , D 3 , t = (cid:8) R r (cid:9) 0 ⩽ r ⩽ t − 1 . ( 2 . 5 ) Assuming D 1 , t is observed , ( 2 . 4 ) ensures R t ∈ F t . By combining ( 2 . 1 ) - ( 2 . 5 ) , we build a TSI model for hospitalization and incidence data . Indeed , the terms { E ( H r ) } 1 ⩽ r ⩽ t − 1 in D 2 , t can be expressed as functions of the hospitalization propensity and the R t according to our model . This implies that D 2 , t ⊂ σ (cid:16) { I r , R r } 0 ⩽ r ⩽ t − 1 (cid:17) and hospitalization data are linked with the disease transmission through the hospitalization propensity . In a broader context , one could substitute D 2 , t in ( 2 . 5 ) with (cid:8) I r , H r (cid:9) 0 ⩽ r ⩽ t − 1 . We have reserved this general setting and its simulation performance to the Supplementary Materials , focusing here on the model shown in Equation ( 2 . 5 ) . 2 . 2 Composite Likelihood Function Specifying the full likelihood function for the proposed model is challenging . Specifically , the joint distribution of ( I r , H r ) given G r − 1 for 0 ⩽ r ⩽ t is difficult to retrieve due to the convolution structure outlined in Equation ( 2 . 2 ) , the irregular boundaries and range restrictions applied to { I r , H r } 0 ⩽ r ⩽ t , and the fact that h t , s are often unobserved in practice . Therefore , we adopt a composite likelihood approach to estimate the model parameters . Specifically , we use joint distribution of ( I r , H r ) given F r − 1 instead of G r − 1 to construct a composite log - likelihood function ℓ C = (cid:88) 0 ⩽ r ⩽ t log P (cid:0) H r , I r | F r − 1 (cid:1) . ( 2 . 6 ) TSI model for Hospitalization and Incidence Data 9 To derive this function , we first demonstrate in the following lemma that h t , s given F t − 1 follows a Poisson distribution and that h t , k 1 and h t , k 2 are independent given F t − 1 when k 1 ̸ = k 2 . Then we derive the form of individual component P (cid:0) H r , I r | F r − 1 (cid:1) based on this lemma . Lemma 1 For arbitrary t > 0 , − 1 ⩽ k 1 , k 2 ⩽ min { t , ˜ η } and k 1 ̸ = k 2 , we have h t , k 1 | F t − 1 ∼ Poisson ( ˜ ω k 1 R t Λ t ) , h t , k 2 | F t − 1 ∼ Poisson ( ˜ ω k 2 R t Λ t ) , ( 2 . 7 ) and h t , k 1 | F t − 1 ⊥ h t , k 2 | F t − 1 . Moreover , ( h t , k 1 , h t , k 2 ) | G t − 1 = ( h t , k 1 , h t , k 2 ) | F t − 1 , and h t , k 1 | G t − 1 ⊥ h t , k 2 | G t − 1 . The joint distribution of ( H r , I r ) and { h r − s , s } 1 ⩽ s ⩽ ˜ η conditioning on F r − 1 can be written as P (cid:0) H r , I r , h r − ˜ η , ˜ η , · · · , h r − 1 , 1 | F r − 1 (cid:1) = P (cid:18) h r − ˜ η , ˜ η , · · · , h r − 1 , 1 , h r , 0 = H r − ˜ η (cid:88) s = 1 h r − s , s , (cid:88) s = − 1 , 1 , ··· , ˜ η h r , s = I r − H r + ˜ η (cid:88) s = 1 h r − s , s (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) F r − 1 (cid:19) . According to Equation ( 2 . 3 ) and Lemma 1 , it can be written as the product of the probability density functions of a few binomial distributions and two Poisson distributions , such that P (cid:0) H r , I r , h r − ˜ η , ˜ η , · · · , h r − 1 , 1 | F r − 1 (cid:1) ( 2 . 8 ) = ˜ η (cid:89) s = 1 P (cid:16) Binomial ( I r − s , ˜ ω s ) = h r − s , s (cid:17) 1 (cid:16) H r − I r ⩽ ˜ η (cid:88) s = 1 h r − s , s ⩽ H r (cid:17) · P (cid:16) Poisson ( ˜ ω 0 R r Λ r ) = H r − ˜ η (cid:88) s = 1 h r − s , s (cid:17) · P (cid:16) Poisson ( ( 1 − ˜ ω 0 ) R r Λ r ) = I r − H r + ˜ η (cid:88) s = 1 h r − s , s (cid:17) Therefore , the joint distribution of ( H r , I r ) conditioning on F r − 1 can be calculated by sum - ming over all possible values of { h r − s , s } 1 ⩽ s ⩽ ˜ η as follows . P (cid:0) H r , I r | F r − 1 (cid:1) = (cid:88) h r − ˜ η , ˜ η , ··· , h r − 1 , 1 P (cid:0) H r , I r , h r − ˜ η , ˜ η , · · · , h r − 1 , 1 | F r − 1 (cid:1) . ( 2 . 9 ) 10 J . Shi and others 3 . Inference 3 . 1 Estimation In this section , we describe the procedures for estimating model parameters using Monte Carlo expectation – maximization ( MCEM ) algorithms , treating { h r − s , s } 1 ⩽ s ⩽ ˜ η as missing data . Let γ = ( β , θ , ω , ˜ ω ) ∈ Γ denote the model parameters , and we use notations like P γ to indicate that the probability is associated with the parameter value γ . We use γ 0 to denote the parameter values corresponding to the underlying true data - generating mechanism , and ˆ γ denote the maximum composite likelihood estimator . Let D obs , r = { X j , I j } 0 ⩽ j ⩽ r ∪ { H r } denote the observed data and D miss , r = { h r − s , s } 1 ⩽ s ⩽ ˜ η denote the missing data at time r . In the MCEM algorithm , we use N 0 to denote the Monte - Carlo sample size , and D ( m , k ) miss , r , 1 ⩽ m ⩽ N 0 to denote the m - th Monte - Carlo sample in the k - th iteration of the EM algorithm . In addition , we use γ ( k ) to denote the current estimate after the k - th EM iteration , and similarly , use R ( k ) r and Λ ( k ) r to denote the estimates of R r and Λ r based on ( 2 . 1 ) and ( 2 . 4 ) with parameters replaced by γ ( k ) . The estimation procedure is conceptualized in the following steps and a pseudo - code to implement these steps is shown in Algorithm 1 . E step At the ( k + 1 ) - th iteration , given the current estimate γ ( k ) = ( β ( k ) , θ ( k ) , ω ( k ) , ˜ ω ( k ) ) , this step is to compute the expected complete data composite log - likelihood , or the Q - function , which is defined as Q ( γ | γ ( k ) ) def = (cid:88) 0 ⩽ r ⩽ t E γ ( k ) (cid:16) log P γ (cid:0) H r , I r , D miss , r | F r − 1 (cid:1) | D obs , r (cid:17) , ( 3 . 10 ) where the expectation is taken with respect to the distribution of D miss , r conditional on ( D obs , r , γ ( k ) ) . Due to the computational complexity , the Q - function is calculated using the Monte Carlo method by sampling D miss , r from P γ ( k ) (cid:0) D miss , r | D obs , r (cid:1) and is calculated as ˆ Q ( γ | γ ( k ) ) def = (cid:88) 0 ⩽ r ⩽ t 1 N 0 N 0 (cid:88) m = 1 log P γ (cid:0) H r , I r , D ( m , k ) miss , r | F r − 1 (cid:1) . TSI model for Hospitalization and Incidence Data 11 M step This step is to compute γ ( k + 1 ) = arg max γ ∈ Γ ˆ Q ( γ | γ ( k ) ) . If arg max γ ∈ Γ ˆ Q ( γ | γ ( k ) ) is not unique , we randomly choose one as γ ( k + 1 ) . When ˆ Q ( γ ( k ) | γ ( k ) ) = max γ ∈ Γ ˆ Q ( γ | γ ( k ) ) , we choose γ ( k + 1 ) = γ ( k ) . It is worth noting that drawing samples from P γ ( k ) ( D miss , r | D obs , r ) is equivalent to drawing from P γ ( k ) ( H r , I r , D miss , r | F r − 1 ) because P γ ( k ) ( H r , I r | F r − 1 ) in Equation ( 2 . 9 ) is a constant for a known γ ( k ) . Therefore , in Algorithm 1 , we first draw samples from P γ ( k ) ( D miss , r | F r − 1 ) and accept them with an acceptance rate , p acceptance , proportional to P γ ( k ) ( H r , I r | D miss , r , F r − 1 ) . In practice , the acceptance rate can be adjusted to accelerate the sampling speed . Specifically , according to Stirling’s approximation and the shape of Poisson distributions , we may replace p acceptance in Algorithm 1 with p acceptance - adj = 2 πR ( k ) r Λ ( k ) r (cid:113) ˜ ω ( k ) 0 ( 1 − ˜ ω ( k ) 0 ) p acceptance . to improve the algorithm efficiency when the number of infections and hospitalizations is large in the later periods of pandemics . In Algorithm 1 , the parameters of the infectiousness function , ω s , and hospitalization propen - sity , ˜ ω s , are assumed to be unknown . This scenario is often encountered in the early stages of novel pandemics when little is known about the infectious pathogens . However , prior knowledge about ω s and ˜ ω s may sometimes be available from multiple biomedical or contact tracing studies . In such scenarios , we may consider these estimates from other studies as prior knowledge . In the Supplementary Materials , we provide another MCEM algorithm , Algorithm 2 , to estimate the model parameters when prior knowledge about ω s and ˜ ω s is available . 3 . 2 Asymptotic Properties The basic TSI model ( 2 . 1 ) , which describes the generative nature of an infectious pathogen , has many similarities to a branching process . Given that the branching process degenerates on an 12 J . Shi and others Algorithm 1 An MCEM algorithm for estimating the model parameters when both ω s and ˜ ω s are unknown .

Often , no consistent estimator ˆ γ is anticipated in E . Therefore , we set aside the extinction probability P (cid:0) E (cid:1) = P (cid:16) (cid:91) r ⩾ 1 (cid:110) ∂ log P ( I r , H r | F r − 1 ) ∂γ = 0 (cid:111)(cid:17) and focus on the asymptotic behavior of ˆ γ on the non - extinction set E none . In the following theorems , we demonstrate that the ascent property of the composite likeli - hood function is preserved with the application of the proposed MCEM algorithm and that this algorithm converges for our model . Subsequently , we establish the consistency of the maximum composite likelihood estimator and present it in a practical form of Equation ( 2 . 4 ) , subject to certain regularity conditions . Details of the proof can be found in the Supplementary Materials . Theorem 1 ( Ascent property of the composite likelihood function ) For k ⩾ 0 , we have ℓ C ( γ ( k + 1 ) ) ⩾ ℓ C ( γ ( k ) ) . Theorem 2 ( Convergence of the MCEM - algorithm ) Assume Γ is a compact set , then with k → ∞ , the MCEM - estimator γ ( k ) at the k - th iteration converges to one of the stationary point γ s induced by M ( · ) = arg max γ ∈ Γ Q ( γ | · ) , and ℓ C ( γ ( k ) ) converges monotonically to ℓ C ( γ s ) . To demonstrate the consistency of the maximum composite likelihood estimator , we require additional regularity conditions for the behaviors of the observed time series . Drawing inspiration from pioneering work in counting process ( Zeger , 1988 ; Zeger and Qaqish , 1988 ; Davis and others , 1999 , 2000 , 2003 ; Fokianos and others , 2009 ; Neumann and others , 2011 ; Doukhan and others , 2012 ) , we first assume Condition 1 ( Series ergodicity ) There exist t 0 > 0 , such that , lim t →∞ t 0 t t (cid:88) s = 1 R s Λ s → a . s . t 0 (cid:88) s = 1 E R s Λ s , lim t →∞ t 0 t t (cid:88) s = 1 I s log ( R s ) → a . s . t 0 (cid:88) s = 1 E I s log ( R s ) . We also assume that the time series regression , represented by Equation ( 2 . 4 ) , uses a log 14 J . Shi and others link function and is characterized as an autoregressive model of order 1 , such that log ( R t ) = Z Tt β + θ 0 + θ 1 log ( R t − 1 ) . We then establish the consistency of the maximum composite likelihood estimator for the time series regression coefficients when the infectiousness function and hospital - ization propensity , ( ω s , ˜ ω s ) , are known . We denote the parameters of interest as γ | ω = ( β , θ ) . The consistency of the maximum composite likelihood estimator , ˆ γ | ω = ( ˆ β , ˆ θ ) , is shown as follows . Theorem 3 ( Strong consistency of the estimators ) Under condition 1 and assuming that Γ is a compact set , we have ˆ γ | ω a . s . −−→ γ 0 | ω as the length of the observational days t → ∞ , where γ 0 | ω is the parameter value corresponding to the true data generating mechanism . Furthermore , with the following conditions from the theorem 3 of Kaufmann ( 1987 ) , that is Condition 2 ( Non - singularity ) For each 1 ⩽ r ⩽ t , define ξ r ( γ | ω ) = ∂R r ∂γ | ω · R − 1 r · (cid:0) I r − R r Λ r (cid:1) .

Simulation Studies 4 . 1 Simulation Setups To evaluate the performance of the proposed method , we conducted several simulation studies under two sets of scenarios . In the first set of scenarios , the reported counts of new infections represent the true number of new infections , indicating that the TSI model for the generation of new infections is correctly specified ( correctly specified model ) . In the second set of scenarios , the reported numbers of new infections contain errors due to under - reporting , limited testing or any other reporting errors , implying that the TSI model is misspecified ( misspecified model ) . In all scenarios , we assumed the hospitalization data to be accurate . Each scenario was repeated for 1 , 000 replications to calculate the bias and coverage probability of the proposed estimator . In the simulations , data on daily new infections , hospital admissions , and the covariates as - sociated with disease transmission are generated from the proposed model ( 2 . 1 ) - ( 2 . 5 ) , with ( 2 . 4 ) simplified as log ( R r ) = Z Tr β + θ 0 + θ 1 log ( R r − 1 ) , for r ⩾ 1 , which means that the logarithm of the instantaneous reproduction number { R r } 1 ⩽ r ⩽ t , follows an AR ( 1 ) structure with exoge - nous terms . Following the results in an earlier study by Li and others ( 2020 ) , we configured the infectiousness function and the hospitalization propensity as follows ω s = P (cid:0) Γ ( k 1 , µ 1 ) ∈ [ s − 1 , s ) (cid:1) , s = 1 , · · · , 24 , and ω 25 = P (cid:0) Γ ( k 1 , µ 1 ) ⩾ 24 (cid:1) , 2˜ ω s = P (cid:0) Γ ( k 2 , µ 2 ) ∈ [ s , s + 1 ) (cid:1) , s = 0 , · · · , 4 , 2˜ ω 5 = P (cid:0) Γ ( k 2 , µ 2 ) ⩾ 5 (cid:1) , and ˜ ω − 1 = 0 . 5 , 16 J . Shi and others with the Gamma distributions Γ ( · , · ) having shape parameters k 1 = 2 . 5 , k 2 = 1 . 6 , and scale parameters µ 1 = 3 , µ 2 = 1 . 5 . We set the study duration T = 120 and fixed p = 2 . Parameter values were assigned as ( θ 0 , θ 1 , β T ) = ( 0 . 7 , 0 . 5 , − . 02 , − . 125 ) . We independently simulated the two sequences of covariates { Z r , 1 , Z r , 2 } 1 ⩽ r ⩽ t to emulate real data on temperature in Philadelphia and social distancing data derived from daily cellular telephone movements , as provided by Unacast Unacast ( 1st ) . This data represented the percentage change in visits to non - essential businesses , such as restaurants and hair salons , between March 1st and June 30th , 2020 . 4 . 2 Simulation Results with Correctly Specified Model In this set of scenarios , we explored three circumstances and compared the model’s performance against the reference approach by Cori and others ( 2013 ) . In the first circumstance , we assumed the infectiousness function ω s and hospitalization propensity ˜ ω s were known . The model param - eters were reduced to γ = ( θ T , β T ) . For the reference approach , we selected the sliding window by minimizing the L 2 - distance of the estimated and oracle sequence of { R r } 1 ⩽ r ⩽ t . For the pro - posed method , we selected the initial γ ( 0 ) randomly and away from the oracle value . Figure 2 demonstrates the estimation bias of { R r } 1 ⩽ r ⩽ t for both methods . We found that both methods could capture the trend of { R r } 1 ⩽ r ⩽ t well with a very small estimation bias , but the proposed method performed better than the baseline method with a smaller bias . Moreover , when ω s and ˜ ω s were known , we found the proposed MCEM algorithm converged very fast , and the estima - tion bias for { R r } 1 ⩽ r ⩽ t reached its limit after only two iterations of running the algorithm . In the second circumstance , we assumed that ω s and ˜ ω s were unknown but prior knowledge about ω s was available . We used the estimated infectiousness functions from previous studies as the prior knowledge , ( Wu and others , 2020 ; Ali and others , 2020 ; Chen and others , 2022 ; Deng and others , 2021 ) , set the true function according to the results in Li and others ( 2020 ) , and used Algorithm 2 to estimate the parameters . The results were similar to those observed in the first TSI model for Hospitalization and Incidence Data 17 circumstance when ω s and ˜ ω s were known , except for a small increase in estimation bias for both approaches . In the third circumstance , we assumed that ω s and ˜ ω s were unknown and no prior knowledge was available . In this situation , we only estimated the parameters using the proposed method , since the reference approach either requires user - specified values to constrain the overall shape of the infectiousness function or needs user - provided contact tracking data to estimate the infectiousness function . Using the proposed method , we estimated the regression coefficients as well as the infectiousness function and hospitalization propensity . As shown in Table . 1 , the proposed method produced accurate estimates for parameters with small bias and good coverage probability . The method also consistently estimated the instantaneous reproduction numbers , as shown in Figure 3 . Overall , when the TSI model is correctly specified , the proposed composite likelihood MCEM algorithm benefits from incorporating hospital admission data , outperforming the reference approach . Table 1 . Performance of the proposed method when the reported number of daily new infections was accurate , the infectiousness function ω s and hospitalization propensity ˜ ω s were unknown and no prior knowledge was available . For ω s and ˜ ω s , only estimates of selected parameters are presented , due to the large number of parameters . Estimates of the other parameters not shown here yield similar results . θ 0 θ 1 β 1 β 2 ω 5 ω 6 ˜ ω 0 Empirical bias ( × 10 − 3 ) - 0 . 15 2 . 10 0 . 08 0 . 15 - 0 . 45 - 0 . 40 - 0 . 04 Relative bias ( × 10 − 3 ) - 0 . 22 4 . 20 - 3 . 79 - 1 . 23 - 4 . 40 - 4 . 01 - 0 . 32 Standard error ( × 10 − 3 ) 6 . 29 3 . 34 0 . 23 0 . 39 2 . 23 2 . 29 0 . 60 95 % Coverage probability 94 . 6 % 92 . 0 % 94 . 2 % 96 . 2 % 96 . 2 % 97 . 0 % 94 . 4 % 4 . 3 Simulation Results with Misspecified Model In the second sets of scenarios , we assumed the reported number of daily new infections was not accurate . In these scenarios , only a proportion of true infections were reported , and this proportion varied from day to day . We generated the daily proportion of unreported infections from a normal distribution with mean and standard deviation equal to 15 % and 5 % , respectively . This allowed the daily under - reporting proportion to vary from 0 % to 30 % , resulting in poor data 18 J . Shi and others Fig . 2 . Comparison of the estimation bias in the daily instantaneous reproduction number , R t , between the proposed method and Cori’s method ( Cori and others , 2013 ) when the reported number of daily new infections was accurate , and both the infectiousness function ω s and hospitalization propensity ˜ ω s were known . The estimation bias was calculated as the difference between the estimated daily R t and the oracle R t that generates the data . Fig . 3 .

TSI model for Hospitalization and Incidence Data 19 quality for the reported infection numbers . However , we assumed the daily hospital admission data were accurate , ensuring that all hospitalized patients were reported and documented in a timely manner . Given the oracle instantaneous reproduction number , we simulated the number of true daily infections , the underreporting proportion , and hospital admission data in each replication . We calculated parameter estimates and the instantaneous reproduction number using the proposed method . We found that the performance was very similar to the correctly specified model scenario shown in Table 1 . For example , the mean of the point estimates for β was very close to the estimated parameter value ( - 0 . 0206 , - 0 . 1239 ) in the mis - specified model , compared to ( - 0 . 02 , - 0 . 125 ) in the correctly specified model . However , the standard error for β was higher in the mis - specified model scenario ( 0 . 003 , 0 . 009 ) compared to the correctly specified model ( 0 . 0003 , 0 . 0004 ) . We also compared the results with another recently proposed method that used a measurement error model to account for the data errors in the reported infections ( Shi and others , 2022 ) . We found that although both methods reduced the bias induced by data errors , the proposed method performed slightly better than Shi and others ( 2022 ) , providing more accurate estimates of the instantaneous reproduction number , as shown in Figure 4 . 5 . Application to COVID - 19 Data We applied the proposed method to a COVID - 19 dataset comprising daily reported infections and hospital admissions from January 1st to June 30th , 2021 , across four counties : Miami - Dade , FL ; New York , NY ; Cook ( Chicago ) , IL ; and Wayne ( Detroit ) , MI . These counties represent four major metropolitan areas in the Southeast coast , Tri - State area , and Great Lakes region of the United States . We obtained county - level data on daily new infections and hospitalizations due to COVID - 19 from the National Healthcare Safety Network ( NHSN ) database . Additionally , two county - level variables were sourced : daily social distancing practices , indicated by the percentage 20 J . Shi and others Fig . 4 .

Black dotted line stands for the oracle instantaneous reproduction number .

Blue dashed line stands for the estimates using a com - parison method ( Shi and others , 2022 ) . change in visits to nonessential businesses ( from Unacast ) , and wet - bulb temperature ( from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ) . Our objectives included estimating the daily instantaneous reproduction number R t , the infectiousness function ω s , and the hospitalization propensity ˜ ω s of COVID - 19 during the study period . We also aimed to evaluate the association between county - level factors and COVID - 19 disease transmission . Our findings are intended to provide evidence supporting the selection of appropriate public health policies and guide health resource allocation in each county . When fitting the proposed model , we allowed the hospitalization propensity to vary by county considering differential health resources and access to healthcare across the four counties . In addition , given the limitations of the US COVID - 19 disease surveillance data , which record in - cidence at the time of disease diagnosis rather than actual infection and considering that the exact infection times are rarely known , we interpret the infectiousness function and hospital - ization propensity estimated from this data based on the diagnosis time rather than infection TSI model for Hospitalization and Incidence Data 21 time . Specifically , we designated ˜ ω − 1 , c and ˜ ω s , c to represent the propensities of never becoming hospitalized and being hospitalized on the s - th day after diagnosis , respectively , for each county with c ∈ { 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 } . This specification facilitates modeling heterogeneity across counties . We also assume the ω s reflects the infectiousness of the existing infectious individuals on the s - th day af - ter diagnosis . We employed the block approach ( B¨uhlmann and K¨unsch , 1999 ; B¨uhlmann , 2002 ; Hall , 1985 ; K¨unsch , 1989 ) to calculate the bootstrap confidence interval . Additionally , the fitted time series structure ( 2 . 4 ) was determined by data using AIC among the family of autoregres - sive models with exogenous terms . The lengths of the infectiousness function and hospitalization propensity , η and ˜ η , were directly determined by maximizing the composite likelihood . The final model selected was the same as the AR ( 1 ) model used in the simulation study . The η and ˜ η were estimated to be 22 and 4 , respectively . The estimated effect sizes for social distanc - ing and wet - bulb temperature were 0 . 1539 , with a 95 % confidence interval of ( 0 . 1537 , 0 . 1541 ) , and − 7 . 3 × 10 − 4 , with a 95 % confidence interval of ( − 8 . 3 × 10 − 4 , − 6 . 4 × 10 − 4 ) , respectively . These results suggested that lack of social distancing was a strong risk factor for elevated disease transmission during the study period . For example , a 50 % reduction in the frequency of visiting non - essential businesses was estimated to reduce R t by an average of 7 . 4 % . On the contrary , temperature exerted only a minor effect on disease transmission during the study period . The estimated county - level R t exhibited a similar trend during the study period among all four coun - ties , as depicted in Figure 5 . A decrease in disease transmission was observed since April 2021 , which , in this dataset , was largely attributed to a reduction in social distancing value . Figure 6 illustrates the estimated infectiousness function . The shape of the infectiousness functions resem - bled the probability density function of either a Gamma or Weibull distribution ( Figure 6a ) , with nearly two - thirds of secondary infections being diagnosed within the first week after the diagnosis of the infectors ( Figure 6b ) . If we assume that the duration between infection and diagnosis is roughly the same for both infectors and secondary infections , our finding suggests that timely 22 J .

Shaded areas indicate the bootstrap confidence intervals . testing and a subsequent week - long quarantine of infected individuals can significantly mitigate disease transmission . The estimated hospitalization propensity for each county is presented in Figure 7 . Given the varied access to healthcare , hospitalization propensity diverged across locations . In New York , the propensity for hospitalization sometime after diagnosis was highest among the four studied counties , slightly lower than 20 % , compared to about 10 % in Miami ( Figure 7b ) . The propensity for hospitalization on the first day of diagnosis was also highest in New York , at approximately TSI model for Hospitalization and Incidence Data 23 Fig . 6 .

Despite these differences , we found that most hospitalizations occurred within 4 days after a COVID - 19 diagnosis , and the mean time from diagnosis to hospital admission was around 1 day in all four counties . Assuming it takes , on average , 48 hours from symptom onset to diagnosis , then most COVID - 19 hospital - izations occurred within 6 days after symptom onset , and the mean time from symptom onset to hospital admission is around 3 days . These results generated from our analysis are consistent with findings from other COVID - 19 studies based on different cohorts . For example , a CDC report showed that 20 . 9 % diagnosed COVID - 19 patients in US were hospitalized before March 28 , 2020 ( Team and others , 2020 ) . Zhang and others ( 2020 ) studied patients from early Hubei , China , for COVID patients during Jan 19 to Feb 17 , 2020 . They found that the mean time from symptom onset to hospital admission decreased from 4 . 4 days ( 95 % CI 0 . 0 – 14 . 0 ) for the period of Dec 24 to Jan 27 , to 2 . 6 days ( 0 . 0 – 9 . 0 ) for the period of Jan 28 to Feb 17 . These estimates of COVID - 19 24 J . Shi and others hospitalizations are important and can inform hospital planning . However , traditionally , study - ing such durations requires epidemiological studies with contact tracing data , which poses a high requirement for the US disease surveillance system . Our study demonstrates that our method can utilize US disease surveillance data to estimate these parameters . Fig . 7 .

Most of the hospitalized patients were admitted to a hospital on the day of infection . 6 . Discussion Given the existing importance of the TSI model in studying infectious diseases , the proposed method and algorithm elevate its usefulness and potential to a higher level . The proposed model not only enhances the robustness of the TSI model by incorporating hospitalization data but also enables investigations into infectiousness functions and hospitalization propensities . This , in turn , facilitates the prediction of hospitalization using the TSI model . REFERENCES 25 The proposed method can be extended in several ways . First , the framework can be expanded to incorporate additional data elements , such as disease - related daily death counts , PCR tests , and serological data , aiming to further enhance the accuracy of parameter estimates and enable the modeling and prediction of death counts . Second , the proposed method does not take into account potential spatial correlations between locations in disease transmission . Traffic data can be utilized to construct a correlation matrix for modeling such correlations , thus improving the model’s efficiency . Third , the evolution of infectious pathogens and changes in immunity due to infections and vaccinations can alter the dynamics of disease transmission . The proposed method can be extended to study different variants of the virus and assess the impact of population immu - nity on disease transmission . Fourth , the model can be expanded to accommodate overdispersion in daily infection numbers or reduce parametric assumptions through method constraints .
