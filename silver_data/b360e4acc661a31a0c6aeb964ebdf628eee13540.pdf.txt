Here we report that srGAP2 negatively regulates neuronal migration and induces neurite outgrowth and branching through the ability of its F - BAR domain to induce ﬁlo - podia - like membrane protrusions resembling those induced by I - BAR domains in vivo and in vitro . Previous work has suggested that in nonneuronal cells ﬁlopodia dynamics decrease the rate of cell migration and the persistence of leading edge protrusions . srGAP2 knockdown reduces leading process branching and increases the rate of neuronal migration in vivo . Overexpression of srGAP2 or its F - BAR domain has the opposite effects , increasing leading process branching and decreasing migra - tion . These results suggest that F - BAR domains are functionally diverse and highlight the functional importance of proteins directly regulating membrane deformation for proper neuronal migration and morphogenesis . INTRODUCTION During brain development , neural progenitor proliferation , neuronal migration , and differentiation require considerable changes in cell shape involving coordinated cytoskeletal and membrane remodeling ( Ayala et al . , 2007 ; Luo , 2002 ) . Neuronal migration involves the coordinated extension and adhesion of the leading process ( LP ) along the radial glial scaffold with the forward translocation of the nucleus , which requires regulation of centrosome and microtubule dynamics by proteins such as Lis1 , Doublecortin , and Nudel among others ( Ayala et al . , 2007 ; Higginbotham and Gleeson , 2007 ; Lambert de Rouvroit and Gofﬁnet , 2001 ) . However , little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying membrane dynamics during neuronal migration and morphogenesis . The basis of neurite initiation , outgrowth , and branching is rooted in the ability of the actin and microtubule cytoskeleton to undergo dynamic changes ( Gupton and Gertler , 2007 ; Luo , 2002 ; Mattila and Lappalainen , 2008 ) . Filopodia have been shown to play a role in neurite initiation ( Dent et al . , 2007 ; Kwiat - kowski et al . , 2007 ) , growth cone dynamics ( Burnette et al . , 2007 ; Gallo and Letourneau , 2004 ) , neurite outgrowth ( Luo , 2002 ) , and branching ( Dent et al . , 2004 ; Gallo and Letourneau , 1998 ) . Down - regulation of the actin anti - cappers ENA / VASP proteins , which are potent inducers of ﬁlopodia , resulted in failed neurite initia - tion and also in defects in cortical lamination ( Kwiatkowski et al . , 2007 ) , suggesting a functional relationship between ﬁlopo - dia formation , neurite initiation , and neuronal migration . Classically , ﬁlopodia formation is thought to be primarily dependent on proteins that regulate actin polymerization at the barbedendofactinﬁlamentsandproteinsbundlingF - actin ( Gup - ton and Gertler , 2007 ) . Interestingly , the BAR superfamily member IRSp53 has been shown to induce ﬁlopodia through membrane deformation independently of its F - actin bundling activity ( Lim et al . , 2008 ; Mattila et al . , 2007 ; Saarikangas et al . , 2009 ) . The BAR domain superfamily contains three main groups : ( 1 ) the Bin / Amphiphysin / Rvs ( BAR ) domain subfamily ( Itoh and De Camilli , 2006 ) , ( 2 ) the Fes - Cip4 homology BAR ( also called F - BAR or EFC ) domain subfamily ( Itoh et al . , 2005 ; Tsujita et al . , 2006 ; reviewed in Frost et al . , 2009 ) , and ( 3 ) the I - BAR subfamily ( reviewed in Scita et al . , 2008 ) . Structural analysis of three F - BAR domains demonstrated that these domains are elongated homo - dimers characterized by a shallow curvature formed by the anti - parallel interaction of two a - helical coiled coils ( Henne et al . , 2007 ; Shimada et al . , 2007 ) . In addition to sharing the general fold and quaternary organization of the BAR domain superfamily , 990 Cell 138 , 990 – 1004 , September 4 , 2009 ª 2009 Elsevier Inc . F - BAR domains share functional properties with ‘‘classical’’ BAR domains , mostnotably theability tobindanddeformmembranes in vitro and in living cells ( Frost et al . , 2008 ; Itoh et al . , 2005 ; Kaki - moto et al . , 2006 ; Shimada et al . , 2007 ) . However , to date , the invivo functions ofF - BAR domain - containing proteins are largely unknown ( Frost et al . , 2009 ) . Here we identify slit - robo GTPase activating protein ( srGAP2 ) as a regulator of neuronal migration and morphogenesis through the unexpected ability of its N - terminal F - BAR domain to induce ﬁlopodia - like membrane protrusions resembling those induced by I - BAR domains . Our results highlight the functional impor - tance of proteins directly regulating membrane deformation for proper neuronal migration and axon - dendrite morphogenesis . RESULTS Expression of srGAP2 in the Developing Cortex To begin our study of the role of srGAP2 in cortical development , we ﬁrst examined its pattern of expression . srGAP1 – 3 have recently been reported to be expressed throughout the cortex during and after radial migration ( Bacon et al . , 2009 ; Mattar et al . , 2004 ; Yao et al . , 2008 ) . Our analysis conﬁrmed that srGAP2 mRNA is expressed throughout the developing cortex and is found both in proliferative zones ( ventricular zone [ VZ ] and sub - ventricular zone [ SVZ ] ) at embryonic day 13 ( E13 ) and E15 and in postmitotic regions ( cortical plate [ CP ] ) at E15 and postnatal day 1 ( P1 ) ( Figure 1A ) . In order to determine the pattern of srGAP2 protein expression , we used a polyclonal antibody raised against the C terminus of srGAP2 ( Figures 1B and 1C ; Yao et al . , 2008 ) . srGAP2 protein is expressed throughout cortical development culminating at P1 corresponding to the peak of neuronal migra - tion in the cortex . Its expression is maintained at P15 and reduced , but still present , in adult cortex ( Figure 1C ) . Immunoﬂuorescent staining for srGAP2 shows that it is ubiqui - touslyexpressedinthecorticalwall ( Figure1D ) beingfoundbothin Nestin - positiveneuronalprogenitorsintheVZ ( Figures1H – 1J ) and MAP2 - positive postmitotic neurons in the CP ( Figures 1E – 1G ) . At the subcellular level , endogenous srGAP2 is found at the cell periphery ( Figures 1K – 1M , arrows ) and was often local - ized along F - actin - rich ﬁlopodia - like protrusions ( arrowhead in Figures 1K – 1P ) in acutely dissociated E15 cortical neurons . Full - Length srGAP2 and Its F - BAR Domain Induce Filopodia Formation Overexpression of F - BAR domain - containing proteins such as FBP17 or CIP4 have been shown to cause membrane invagina - tion and tubulation in cell lines ( Itoh et al . , 2005 ; Tsujita et al . , 2006 ) . Surprisingly , expression of srGAP2 did not induce any membrane invaginations but instead induced ﬁlopodia formation ( see Figures S1D – S1F and S1P available online ) . This effect requires its F - BAR domain since deletion of the F - BAR domain ( srGAP2 D F - BAR - EGFP ) does not induce ﬁlopodia formation in COS7 cells ( Figures S1G – S1I and S1P ) . Interestingly , unlike the F - BAR domains of FBP17 and CIP4 ( Itoh et al . , 2005 ) , expression of the F - BAR domain of srGAP2 did not inhibit endocytosis , as assessed using Alexa546 - Trans - ferrin uptake assay ( Figure S2 ) . Furthermore , expression of the isolated F - BAR domain fused to EGFP induced ﬁlopodia forma - tion similar to full - length srGAP2 ( Figures S1J , S1K , and S1P ) . Of note , the F - BAR domain is a potent membrane - targeting motif ( Figure S1J ) . These data suggest that the F - BAR domain of srGAP2 is necessary and sufﬁcient for membrane localization and the induction of ﬁlopodia - like membrane protrusions . In order to distinguish the membrane - targeting function of the F - BAR domain from its membrane deformation activity , we identiﬁed a small truncation of the last C - terminal 49 amino acids ( F - BAR D 49 ) ( Figure S3A and Supplemental Experimental Proce - dures for details ) . Expression of F - BAR D 49 - EGFP results in signif - icant membrane targeting ( Figure S4 ) but fails to induce ﬁlopodia in COS7 cells ( Figures S1M – S1P ) . We do not currently know the structural basis for the inability of this truncation to elicit ﬁlopodia but we can at least exclude two possibilities : ( 1 ) instability of the F - BAR D 49 protein since it expresses at a level comparable to full - length srGAP2 or its F - BAR domain in cells ( Figure S5 ) and ( 2 ) this truncation does not disrupt its dimerization properties since F - BAR D 49 can dimerize with F - BAR or full - length srGAP2 ( data not shown ) . Interestingly , these 49 amino acids reside in an extension speciﬁc to the srGAP subfamily ( a 6 – 8 ; Figure S3A ) that is C - terminal to the minimal , predicted F - BAR domain ( amino acids 1 – 358 ; Itoh et al . , 2005 ) ( Figure S3B ) . Indeed , we were unable to obtain stable protein expression of this minimal predicted F - BAR domain ( amino acids 1 – 358 ) in mammalian cells or bacteria ( data not shown ) . Furthermore , as shown for other F - BAR domains ( Frost et al . , 2008 ; Itoh et al . , 2005 ; Kaki - moto et al . , 2006 ; Shimada et al . , 2007 ) , srGAP2 forms a stable dimer in solution as assessed by light scattering assays ( Figure S3C ) , and deletion of the Fes - Cip4 homology ( FCH ) domain ( green box in Figure S3A ) , which represents a signiﬁcant portion of the dimerization interface , abolishes the ability of srGAP2 to induce ﬁlopodia in COS7 cells ( data not shown ) . Alto - gether , these data suggest that all eight predicted a helices are likely to be required for formation of the functional F - BAR domain of srGAP2 . The F - BAR Domain of srGAP2 Deforms Membrane Like an I - BAR Domain The ability of srGAP2 or its F - BAR domain to induce ﬁlopodia in COS7 cells is reminiscent of the activity of the structurally related I - BAR domain - containing proteins ( Mattila et al . , 2007 ; Millard et al . , 2007 ; Saarikangas et al . , 2009 ; Scita et al . , 2008 ) . Interest - ingly , F - actin depolymerization prevents the dynamics and formation of new ﬁlopodia but does not affect the maintenance of preexisting ﬁlopodia induced by the I - BAR domains of IRSp53 or MIM ( Mattila et al . , 2007 ) . We found the same results for the F - BAR domain of srGAP2 ( Figures 2A – 2C ) , while cells treated with cytochalasin D were depleted of F - actin . Strikingly , this treatment had no effect on membrane localization of the F - BAR domain or on the maintenance of ﬁlopodia - like protru - sions ( Figures 2D – 2F ) . F - BAR - induced ﬁlopodia were highly dynamic in COS7 cells ( Figures 2G – 2J and Movie S1 ) . Treatment with cytochalasin D signiﬁcantly impaired the extension and retraction of F - BAR - induced ﬁlopodia ( Figures 2K – 2N and Movie S2 ) , suggesting that F - actin is required for the dynamics of these protrusions . In order to directly test the membrane deformation properties of the F - BAR domain of srGAP2 , we incubated puriﬁed F - BAR Cell 138 , 990 – 1004 , September 4 , 2009 ª 2009 Elsevier Inc . 991 Figure 1 . srGAP2 Is Expressed in Neuronal Progenitors and Postmitotic Neurons and Localizes to Sites of Membrane Protrusion ( A ) In situ hybridization for srGAP2 in developing cortex at E13 , E15 , and P1 .

As visualized by negative stain transmission electron microscopy , this did not result in lipo - some outward tubulation as has been reported for other F - BAR domains ( see Figure S5B ) . Rather , the F - BAR domain of srGAP2 induced an inward dimpling or ‘‘scalloping’’ of the liposome surface ( Figures 2O and 2P ) , which is reminiscent of the activity of I - BAR domains in the same conditions ( Suetsugu et al . , 2006 ) , suggesting that the F - BAR domain of srGAP2 can induce ‘‘inverse’’ membrane tubulation . These results suggested the possibility that if the puriﬁed F - BAR domain of srGAP2 could be exposed to the inside surface of liposomes , then protrusive tubules would form ( Figure 2Q ) . To test this hypothesis , mixtures of the F - BAR domain with intact , large unilamellar vesicles ( LUVs ) were brieﬂy sonicated , which presumably resulted in transient pore formation in liposomes and introduction of the recombinant F - BAR inside LUVs . Following a wash , liposomes were ﬁxed , negatively stained , and imaged using transmission electron microscopy . As pre - dicted by theI - BAR model , this resulted in numerous longtubular extensions emerging from LUVs ( Figure 2R ) , which is in stark contrast with control sonicated liposomes not incubated with re - combinant protein ( Figure S6A ) . Consistent with the dimensions of tubules induced by other members of the F - BAR and I - BAR families ( Frost et al . , 2008 ; Mattila et al . , 2007 ) , the srGAP2 F - BAR - induced tubules were 83 nm ± 15 nm ( average ± SD , n = 38 ) in diameter . Importantly , at higher magniﬁcation , the tubules observed by negative staining electron microscopy after sonication do not have an obvious protein coat surrounding the liposomes ( Figure 2R ) . This is in contrast with tubules induced by other F - BAR and BAR domains that coat the outer surface of the tubule ( Figure S6B ; Frost et al . , 2008 ; Shimada et al . , 2007 ) . Together , these results suggest that unlike previously characterized F - BAR domains , the F - BAR domain of srGAP2 functions as an I - BAR domain ( Mattila et al . , 2007 ; Suetsugu et al . , 2006 ) . srGAP2 Regulates Neurite Formation and Branching through the Ability of Its F - BAR Domain to Form Filopodia We next tested the function of srGAP2 in neuronal morphogen - esis by designing short hairpin interfering RNA ( shRNA ) in order to acutely knock down srGAP2 expression ( Figure 3A ) . We found that srGAP2 knockdown in E15 cortical neurons led to a signiﬁ - cant decrease in both axonal ( Figures 3C , 3D , and 3F ) and dendritic branching after 5 days in vitro ( DIV ) ( Figures 3G , 3H , and 3J ) . Both of these effects were rescued by cotransfection of a shRNA - resistant form of srGAP2 ( srGAP2 * ; Figures 3B , 3E , 3F , 3I , and 3J ) , demonstrating that this is not an off - target effect . The fact that srGAP2 knockdown reduced branching in cortical neurons , a process previously shown to require ﬁlopodia forma - tion ( Dent et al . , 2004 ; Gallo and Letourneau , 1998 ) , suggests that srGAP2 may promote neurite branching through its ability to induce ﬁlopodia in neurons . To test this hypothesis , we performed a structure / function analysis using electroporation of E15 cortical progenitors with various srGAP2 constructs followed by dissociation and culture , which induces rapid differentiation . First , we restricted our anal - ysis to stage 1 neurons ( Dotti et al . , 1988 ) , when immature post - mitotic neurons produce a signiﬁcant number of ﬁlopodia - like protrusions ( Dent et al . , 2007 ; Kwiatkowski et al . , 2007 ) . Our analysis shows that expression of full - length srGAP2 induced a signiﬁcant increase in ﬁlopodia - like protrusions in stage 1 cortical neurons compared to control EGFP ( Figures 4A – 4C and 4F ) . This effect requires the F - BAR domain since deletion of the F - BAR domain ( srGAP2 D F - BAR ) signiﬁcantly reduced the ability of srGAP2 to induce ﬁlopodia in stage 1 neurons ( Figures 4C and 4F ) . As in COS7 cells , expression of the F - BAR domain alone potently induces formation of F - actin - rich ﬁlopodia ( Figures 4D and 4F ) . Again , the effect of the F - BAR domain requires its membrane deformation properties and not simply its membrane targeting property since expression of F - BAR D 49 does not induce ﬁlopodia in stage 1 cortical neurons ( Figures 4E and 4F ) and instead induces large lamellipodia ( arrowhead in Figure 4E ) . These data suggest that srGAP2 , through its F - BAR domain , induces ﬁlopodia in cortical neurons as shown in COS7 cells . We then analyzed stage 2 neurons , i . e . , prior the emergence of a single axon ( Dotti et al . , 1988 ) , in order to test if srGAP2 and its F - BAR domain were sufﬁcient to promote the transition between ﬁlopodia and elongating neurites deﬁned by the presence of bundled microtubules ( see also Figure S7 for isolated b III - tubulin signal ) . Both full - length srGAP2 and the F - BAR domain signiﬁ - cantly increased the total number of primary neurites emerging fromthecellbody ( Figures4G – 4K ) aswellasthenumberofprimary neurite branches ( Figure 4L ) . Expression of srGAP2 D F - BAR as well as F - BAR D 49 fails to increase primary neurite number and neurite branching compared to control ( Figures 4J – 4L ) . Reduction of srGAP2 Expression Promotes Neuronal Migration To determine the function of srGAP2 during cortical develop - ment , we introduced our shRNA constructs directed against srGAP2 ( Dha2 and Dha5 ; Figure 3A ) into radial glial progenitors at E15 using ex vivo cortical electroporation coupled with orga - notypic slice culture ( Hand et al . , 2005 ) . Interestingly , after 3 days in culture , at a time point when few control shRNA electropo - rated neurons have already migrated ( Figures 5A , 5C , and 5D ) , slices expressing srGAP2 shRNA showed a signiﬁcant increase in the percentage of neurons that have reached the dense CP and a corresponding decreased percentage of neurons in the intermediate zone ( IZ ) ( Figures 5B – 5D ) , suggesting that reduc - tion of srGAP2 expression accelerated radial migration . To test this directly , we used time - lapse confocal microscopy to visu - alize neurons coexpressing nuclear EGFP ( to ease cell tracking ) and control shRNA ( Figures 5E – 5H and Movie S3 ) or srGAP2 shRNA ( Figures 5E – 5L and Movie S4 ) in slice culture . We found ( D – J ) Immunoﬂuorescence staining of srGAP2 protein expression on ﬁxed coronal sections of E15 mouse cortex . srGAP2 protein colocalizes ( arrowheads ) with MAP2 ( postmitotic neuron marker ) in the CP ( D – F ) and also colocalizes with Nestin ( arrowheads ) ( neuronal precursor marker ) in the VZ ( G – I ) . ( K – P ) Immunoﬂuorescence staining of srGAP2 protein in early dissociated cortical neuron cultures ( E15 + 24 hr in vitro [ hiv ] ) . srGAP2 protein is found close to the plasma membrane of immature cortical neurons ( arrow in K – M ) and to F - actin - rich ﬁlopodia ( stained with Alexa546 - phalloidin ; arrowheads in K – P ) . Cell 138 , 990 – 1004 , September 4 , 2009 ª 2009 Elsevier Inc . 993 that srGAP2 shRNA - expressing neurons migrated 25 % faster than those expressing control shRNA ( Figure 5M ) , suggesting that reduction of srGAP2 increased the actual rate of cell trans - location . Excessive LP branching in migrating cortical neurons can inhibit neuronal migration ( Gupta et al . , 2003 ; Ohshima et al . , 2007 ) . Indeed , the LP of srGAP2 knockdown neurons in layers 5 / 6 was signiﬁcantly less branched compared to control shRNA neurons ( Figures 5N – 5P ) . These data suggest that srGAP2 may negatively regulate the rate of radial migration by promoting LP branching and dynamics . The F - BAR Domain Is Necessary and Sufﬁcient for srGAP2 - Mediated Inhibition of Radial Migration We hypothesized that overexpression of srGAP2 or its F - BAR domain should be sufﬁcient to block migration by increasing ﬁlo - podia formation and LP dynamics . Indeed , overexpression of srGAP2 severely inhibited radial migration compared to control EGFP - expressing slices electroporated at E15 and cultured for 5 DIV ( Figures 6E – 6H ) . We quantiﬁed radial migration by deter - mining the ratio of neurons in the dense CP ( where pyramidal neurons complete migration ) and in the IZ , where they initiate radial migration ( see Figure S8 for deﬁnition of cytoarchitecture ) . This CP / IZ ratio ( Figure 6U ) is signiﬁcantly decreased by srGAP2 overexpression ( Figures 6E – 6H ) when compared to control EGFP - expressing neurons ( Figures 6A – 6D ) , demonstrating that srGAP2 overexpression inhibits neuronal migration . Expression of srGAP2 D F - BAR did not signiﬁcantly reduce the CP / IZ ratio compared to EGFP control ( Figures 6I – 6L and 6U ) and is signif - icantly different from the ratio measured by srGAP2 overexpres - sion ( Figure 6U ) , suggesting that the F - BAR domain is partially required for srGAP2’s ability to inhibit migration . Moreover , expression of the F - BAR domain alone was sufﬁcient to reduce neuronal migration to the same extent as srGAP2 while expres - sion of F - BAR D 49 had no effect on the ability of neurons to migrate ( Figures 6M – 6U ) , suggesting that the ability of the F - BAR domain to induce ﬁlopodia is required for the ability of srGAP2 to inhibit neuronal migration . srGAP2 Inhibits Migration by Increasing Leading Process Dynamics and Branching The accumulation of neurons expressing srGAP2 or its F - BAR domain in the IZ suggested that the neurons might be partially blocked in the multipolar to unipolar transition ( Noctor et al . , 2004 ) . Indeed quantiﬁcation of the percentage of multipolar cells Figure 2 .

( cells displaying three or more neurites ) in the IZ of slices electro - porated with srGAP2 or the F - BAR domain revealed a signiﬁcant increase in the percentage of neurons with multiple processes emerging from the cell body compared to control ( Figure 6V ) . This is consistent with the ability of srGAP2 to induce ﬁlopodia and neurite initiation / branching in dissociated neurons ( see Figure 4 ) . Our time - lapse confocal microscopy analysis shows that control neurons in the IZ form a stable LP upon initiating radial migration ( green arrowheads in Figure 6W and Movie S5 ) and undergo efﬁcient cell body translocation ( green arrows in Figure 6W and Movie S5 ) . In contrast , neurons overexpressing srGAP2 or the F - BAR domain alone do not undergo cell body translocation ( red arrows in Figures 6X and 6Y and Movies S6 Figure 3 .

The plasma membrane of these cells appears highly dynamic showing large , transient protrusions ( green arrowheads in Figure 6X ) . While many neurons accumu - late in the IZ , some did manage to translocate into layers 5 / 6 ( Figures 6E – 6H and 6M – 6P ) , where expression of srGAP2 or its F - BAR domain signiﬁcantly increases LP branching compared Figure 7 .

Together , these data suggest that srGAP2 increases neurite initiation and branching through the ability of its F - BAR domain to induce ﬁlopodia , which in turn negatively regulates neuronal migration . Finally , to ensure that the ability of srGAP2 expression to inhibit migration was not due to an indirect effect of srGAP2 expression on progenitor cell cycle exit , we designed a vector allowing us to express srGAP2 in early postmitotic neurons using the 2 . 2 kB NeuroD promoter ( Figure S9A ) . NeuroD is a bHLH transcription factor and a direct tran - scriptional target of Ngn2 ( Hand et al . , 2005 ; Heng et al . , 2008 ) , thereby inducing cDNA expression in intermediate progenitors and early postmitotic neurons in the subventricu - larzonesandIZ ( Figures S10E – S10H ) butnot by Nestin + radial glial progenitors in the VZ as obtained by the chicken b - actin promoter ( Figures S10A – S10D ) . Furthermore , the level of protein expression in neurons obtained with this promoter is signiﬁcantly lower than using the chicken b - actin promoter ( data not shown ; Heng et al . , 2008 ) . Expression of srGAP2 using this NeuroD promoter signiﬁ - cantly reduced the number of cells reaching the CP compared to control ( Figures S9B – S9J ) . srGAP2 Partially Requires Its RhoGAP and SH3 Domains to Inhibit Migration We next wanted to determine the contribu - tions of the RhoGAP and SH3 domains to srGAP2 function in neuronal migration and morphogenesis . In order to determine the substrate speciﬁcity of the GAP domain of srGAP2 , we puriﬁed its GAP domain as a GST fusion ( Figure S11A ) . We then performed ﬂuorescence - based GTP hydrolysis assays ( Figure S11B ; Shutes and Der , 2006 ) . The GAP domain of srGAP2 increased the rate of GTP hydrolysis on Rac1 , but had no effect on RhoA or Cdc42 ( Figure S11B ) or RhoG ( data not shown ) . In addition , full - length srGAP2 strongly interacted with activated Rac1 ( Rac1 Q61L ) but Cell 138 , 990 – 1004 , September 4 , 2009 ª 2009 Elsevier Inc . 999 only weakly interacted with activated Cdc42 Q61L ( Figure S11C ) and activated RhoA Q63L ( data not shown ) . These two indepen - dent approaches demonstrate that the GAP domain of srGAP2 is speciﬁc for Rac1 . To determine the contribution of the Rac1 - GAP domain on srGAP2’s ability to regulate neuronal morphogenesis and migra - tion , we engineered a catalytically inactive form of srGAP2 ( srGAP2 R527L ) . Indeed this mutant was unable to accelerate GTP hydrolysis of Rac1 ( Figure S11D ) . Expression of the ‘‘GAP - dead’’ srGAP2 R527L was as potent as srGAP2 at inducing ﬁlopodia - like membrane protrusions in stage 1 cortical neurons ( compare Figures S12B and S12C ; quantiﬁed in Figure S12F ) and at promoting primary neurite initiation ( Figures S12H and S12I ; quantiﬁed in Figure S12L ) . While this mutation was compe - tent to increase neurite initiation , there were signiﬁcantly fewer ( 2 - fold ) srGAP2 R527L - expressing neurons at stage 2 when compared to srGAP2 ( Figure S13 ) . In addition , srGAP2 R527L displays a reduced ability to induce neurite branching when compared to srGAP2 ( Figure S12L ) , suggesting that the Rac1 - GAP activity of srGAP2 might participate in its function in neurite branching . We tested the contribution of the Rac1 - GAP activity of srGAP2 in its ability to inhibit neuronal migration by expressing srGAP2 R527L in E15 cortical progenitors . This signiﬁcantly inhibited migration compared to control EGFP ( Figures S14A – S14D , S14I – S14L , and S14U ) although not as potently as full - length srGAP2 ( Figures S14E – S14H and S14U ) , suggesting that the Rac1 - GAP activity of srGAP2 contributes to its ability to inhibit migration . In addition , similarly to srGAP2 , expression of srGAP2 R527L increased the percentage of multipolar cells in the IZ ( Figure S14V ) and increased LP branching of radially migrating neurons in layer 5 / 6 ( Figures S14X and 6Z ) . These data suggest that the Rac1 - GAP activity may act to modulate protrusion formation induced by the F - BAR domain of srGAP2 , but is not absolutely required to induce ﬁlopodia - like membrane protrusions and inhibit neuronal migration . To test the contribution of the SH3 domain of srGAP2 , we engineered a mutant to a conserved tryptophan residue ( srGAP2 W765A ) , which was shown to be required for the ability of the SH3 domain of srGAP1 to bind to Robo1 and for the SH3 domain of srGAP3 to bind to WAVE - 1 ( Wong et al . , 2001 ; Li et al . , 2006 ; Soderling et al . , 2002 ) . Expression of srGAP2 W765A , unlike the expression of full - length srGAP2 or its F - BAR domain , did not efﬁciently induce ﬁlopodia - like membrane protrusions in stage 1 cortical neurons ( Figures S12D and S12F ) and had asigniﬁcantlydecreasedabilitytoinduceprimaryneuritebranch - ing compared to full - length srGAP2 ( Figures S12J and S12L ) . Expression of srGAP2 W765A increased primary neurite initiation , but showed a signiﬁcantly reduced percentage ( 2 - fold ) of neurons transitioning from stage 1 to stage 2 compared to srGAP2 ( Figure S13 ) , suggesting that all functional domains of srGAP2 are required for its ability to promote the transition from a ﬁlopodia to an elongating neurite . Interestingly , expression of srGAP2 W765A had no effect on cortical neuron migration ( Figures S14M – S14P and S14U ) , although there was a slight increase in cells with multipolar morphology in the IZ compared to EGFP ( Figure S14V ) . The lack of effect of srGAP2 W765A overexpression on the CP / IZ ratio prompted us to use time - lapse microscopy to observe LP dynamics in radially migrating neurons . This analysis revealed that migrating neurons expressing srGAP2 W765A did not display increased LP branching but instead had a single , stable LP ( red arrowheads in Figure S14W and Movie S8 ) and translocated efﬁciently ( green arrowheads in Figure S14W and Movie S8 ) , which is strikingly different from neurons overexpressing full - length srGAP2 ( Figure 6X ) . Moreover , analysis of neurons in layer 5 / 6 showed no signiﬁcant increase in LP branching as demon - strated with other constructs containing an F - BAR domain ( Figures 6 , 7E , and S14X ) . The fact that srGAP2 W765A showed weak ﬁlopodia formation compared to full - length srGAP2 and no increase in neurite branching suggested that the F - BAR domain might be inhibited in srGAP2 W765A . By analogy to the mode of activation of other RhoGAP and RhoGEF proteins ( Eberth et al . , 2009 ; Mitin et al . , 2007 ; Yohe et al . , 2007 ) , we hypothesized that srGAP2 might normally be in an autoinhibited conformation through structural interaction between the N - terminal F - BAR domain and the C - terminal region ( including the SH3 domain ) that is released upon effector binding to its SH3 domain ( see model in Figure 7G ) . To test this model , we generated a C - terminal deletion of srGAP2 ( srGAP2 D C - term ) , which deletes the entire C - terminal portion starting from the SH3 domain to the C - terminal end . Expression of srGAP2 D C - term potently induced ﬁlopodia forma - tion in stage 1 neurons ( Figures S12E and S12F ) and neurite outgrowth and branching in stage 2 neurons ( Figures S12K and S12L ) . In sharp contrast to srGAP2 W765A , expression of srGAP2 D C - term potently inhibited migration ( Figures S14Q – S14U ) resulting in increased multipolar cells in the IZ ( Figure S14V ) as well as increased LP branching of migrating neurons in layer 5 / 6 similarly to other F - BAR - containing constructs but unlike srGAP2 W765A ( Figures S14X and 7F ) . DISCUSSION srGAP2 Is a Novel F - BAR Domain - Containing Protein It is well established that cytoskeletal dynamics produce forces to generate plasma membrane protrusions and invaginations ; however , recent evidence suggests that many membrane - asso - ciated proteins directly sculpt and deform biological membranes ( Doherty and McMahon , 2008 ) . Here we report that srGAP2 regulates neuronal migration as well as neurite initiation and branching through the ability of its F - BAR domain to deform membranes and form ﬁlopodia - like membrane protrusions . This is a surprising ﬁnding since F - BAR domains have been mostly characterized for their ability to induce membrane tubula - tion and invaginations ( Frost et al . , 2008 ; Habermann , 2004 ; Henne et al . , 2007 ; Itoh and De Camilli , 2006 ; Peter et al . , 2004 ; Shimada et al . , 2007 ) . F - BAR domains are composed of a series of a helices forming a strong dimerization motif , which allow the homodimers to adopt a quaternary ‘‘banana - like’’ structure ( Frost et al . , 2008 ; Henne et al . , 2007 ; Peter et al . , 2004 ; Shimada et al . , 2007 ) . One possibility for how srGAP2’s F - BAR domain may induce ﬁlopodia - like protrusions is by having a different curvature leading to a different surface distribution of positively charged residues than ‘‘canonical’’ F - BAR domains . Interestingly , I - BAR domains present in proteins such as 1000 Cell 138 , 990 – 1004 , September 4 , 2009 ª 2009 Elsevier Inc . IRSp53 or MIM induce ﬁlopodia , a property linked to the inherent curvature of the I - BAR homodimer and the presence of phos - pholipid - binding residues on the convex side of the homodimers ( Lim et al . , 2008 ; Mattila et al . , 2007 ; Millard et al . , 2007 ; Saari - kangas et al . , 2009 ) . We hypothesize that the homodimer formed by the F - BAR domain of srGAP2 displays a general quaternary structure and charge distribution comparable to I - BAR domains . While this can only be proven by structural information , we provide several lines of evidence supporting an I - BAR like behavior : ( a ) the struc - tural maintenance of ﬁlopodia induced by the F - BAR domain of srGAP2 is resistant to F - actin depolymerization , ( b ) overex - pression of the F - BAR domain of srGAP2 does not inhibit endo - cytosis , and ( c ) theF - BARdomainofsrGAP2inducessimilarlipo - some deformations compared to IRSp53 ( Suetsugu et al . , 2006 ) . Interestingly , srGAP2 is not the only predicted F - BAR domain - containing protein inducing ﬁlopodia formation : Gas7 and PSTPIP2 ( MAYP ) have also been shown to induce ﬁlopodia in cell lines ( Chitu et al . , 2005 ; She et al . , 2002 ) . However , these proteins and more importantly their predicted F - BAR domains have not been directly tested for their ability to deform membranes . Our results suggest that the F - BAR domain subfamily could be functionally diverse and that this diversity might be due to subtle structural differences . A Role for srGAP2 during Neuronal Development It was recently shown that ﬁlopodia were required for neurite initiation in cortical neurons ( Dent et al . , 2007 ) . The absence of effect of srGAP2 knockdown on neurite initiation is likely due to the presence of many other proteins involved in ﬁlopodia forma - tion such as I - BAR - containing proteins such as IRSp53 or ABBA ( Mattila and Lappalainen , 2008 ; Saarikangas et al . , 2008 ) or other classes of proteins previously shown to promote ﬁlopodia forma - tion and neurite initiation through distinct mechanisms ( Dent et al . , 2007 ; Kwiatkowski et al . , 2007 ) . The ability of srGAP2 to promote neurite initiation and branch - ing appears to also be important for its regulation of migration ( Figure 7H ) . Knockdown of srGAP2 increased the rate of migra - tion and signiﬁcantly reduced LP complexity and branching ( Figure 7H ) . This could potentially explain the increase in the rate of cell migration , since in ﬁbroblasts , reduction of the activity of proteins promoting ﬁlopodia formation , such as ENA / VASP proteins , increased lamellipodia persistence and increased cell speed ( Bear et al . , 2000 , 2002 ) . In addition , it was recently shown that loss of ENA / VASP proteins in cortical neurons lead to a more superﬁcial laminar position , which could be due to increased rate of migration ( Goh et al . , 2002 ; Kwiatkowski et al . , 2007 ) . Recent siRNA screens in cancer cell lines revealed that downregulation of the srGAP2 homologue srGAP3 also increased the rate of cell migration , suggesting that negative regulation of cell migration may be a conserved function of the srGAP family ( Simpson et al . , 2008 ) . Regulation of srGAP2 : GAP and SH3 Domains The BAR superfamily of proteins are involved in a wide range of functions and this diversity arises from the different functional domains associated with BAR - like domain ( Itoh and De Camilli , 2006 ) . We demonstrate that srGAP2 is a Rac1 - speciﬁc GAP ( as previously shown for srGAP3 ) and recent work has high - lighted the importance of Rac1 regulation in neuronal develop - ment ( Govek et al . , 2005 ) . Mutation of the Rac1 / Cdc42 GEF ARHGEF6 ( also called Cool - 2 or a - PIX ) results in X - linked mental retardation , suggesting the importance of properly regulating Rac1 activity during neuronal development ( Kutsche et al . , 2000 ) . Interestingly , the BAR domain - containing protein Oligo - phrenin - 1 as well as the F - BAR - containing protein srGAP3 ( also called mental retardation GAP or MEGAP ) are both Rac1 - GAPs that have been involved in severe forms of mental retarda - tion ( Billuart et al . , 1998 ; Endris et al . , 2002 ; Govek et al . , 2004 ) . Rac1 has also been implicated in regulating radial migration and neurite outgrowth ( Causeret et al . , 2008 ; Govek et al . , 2005 ; Kawauchi et al . , 2003 ; Konno et al . , 2005 ; Yoshizawa et al . , 2005 ) . Although not required , the GAP activity of srGAP2 might play a role in neurite formation in two ways : ( 1 ) local inac - tivation of Rac1 could result in increased Cdc42 activity , which could in turn activate pathways that promote bundled F - actin that are required for ﬁlopodia formation ( Raftopoulou and Hall , 2004 ) , and / or , ( 2 ) alternatively , Rac1 inactivation could lead to increased activation of RhoA ( since Rac1 activation has been shown to inactivate RhoA [ Nimnual et al . , 2003 ] ) , which in turn could lead to the activation of the formin mDia2 and increased actin nucleation ( Figure 7G ) . A high percentage of F - BAR domain - containing proteins possess SH3 domains ( Itoh and De Camilli , 2006 ) , which bind to effectors ranging from regulators of endocytosis such as dynamin ( Itoh and De Camilli , 2006 ) to regulators of actin poly - merization ( Aspenstrom et al . , 2006 ; Chitu et al . , 2005 ) such as WAVE1 ( Soderling et al . , 2002 ) . The SH3 domain of srGAP2 has been shown to bind the Robo1 receptor ( Wong et al . , 2001 ) and has also been shown to bind N - WASP ( Linkermann et al . , 2009 ) , but the functional relevance of these interactions has yet to be determined . Our results strongly suggest that srGAP2 is autoinhibited at resting state , which is a commonly accepted model of regulation of many RhoGEF and RhoGAP proteins ( Rossman et al . , 2005 ) and the BAR domain - containing proteins GRAF and Oligophrenin - 1 ( Eberth et al . , 2009 ) . Future experiments will test if this autoinhibition can be released by effector binding to the SH3 domain exposing the F - BAR domain to facilitate membrane protrusion ( Figure 7G ) .
