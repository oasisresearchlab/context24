Adaptor proteins play a central role in cargo collection by linking targeting signals to the endocytic machinery . We have characterized NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) ( NPFX [ 1 , 2 ] D ) targeting signals and identiﬁed the actin - associated protein Sla1p as the adaptor for NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D - mediated endocytosis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae . 11 amino acids encompassing an NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D sequence were sufﬁcient to direct uptake of a truncated form of the pheromone receptor Ste2p . In this context , endocytic targeting activity was not sustained by conservative substitutions of the phenylalanine or aspartate . An NPFX 1 , 2 D - related sequence was identiﬁed in native Ste2p that functions redundantly with ubiquitin - based E endocytic signals . A two - hybrid interaction screen for NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D - interacting proteins yielded SLA1 , but no genes encoding Eps15 homology ( EH ) domains , protein modules known to recognize NPF peptides . Furthermore , EH domains did not recognize an NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D signal when directly tested by two - hybrid analysis . SLA1 disruption severely inhibited NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D - mediated endocytosis , but only marginally affected ubiquitin - directed uptake . NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D - dependent internalization required a conserved domain of Sla1p , SLA1 homology domain , which selectively bound an NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D - containing fusion protein in vitro . Thus , through a novel NPF - binding domain , Sla1p serves as an endocytic targeting signal adaptor , providing a means to couple cargo with clathrin - and actin - based endocytic machineries . Introduction Internalization of cell surface components by endocytosis mediates important processes such as nutrient uptake , cell sur - face remodeling , and downregulation of signal transduction events . Rapid internalization of cell surface proteins relies largely on endocytic targeting determinants within their cyto - plasmic domains ( Marks et al . , 1997 ) . In general , such target - ing signals are recognized by adaptors that also interact with core components of the endocytic machinery , thereby guiding bound cargo into nascent endocytic vesicles ( Kirchhausen , 1999 ) . Thus , defining endocytic targeting signals and identi - fying the corresponding adaptors is critical to understanding the endocytic process . Common examples of mammalian endocytic targeting signals include tyrosine - based motifs , YXX (cid:2) and NPXY ( where X is any amino acid [ aa ] * and (cid:2) is a bulky hydropho - bic aa ) , and di - leucine motifs , all of which act as signals for packaging into endocytic clathrin - coated vesicles ( Kirchhausen et al . , 1997 ; Marks et al . , 1997 ) . In the best - characterized case , YXX (cid:2) motifs interact with the (cid:3) subunit of the het - erotetrameric AP - 2 adaptor complex ( Ohno et al . , 1995 ) . AP - 2 also binds to clathrin , promoting assembly of individual clathrin molecules into a polyhedral scaffold ( Kirchhausen , 1999 ) . By serving as an adaptor linking receptors to the clathrin coat , AP - 2 is thought to couple cargo recruitment with vesicle formation . A variety of other endocytic targeting sequences likely functions in a similar fashion by direct or indirect interaction with AP - 2 ( Kirchhausen et al . , 1997 ; Kirchhausen , 1999 ) . In a possible exception , the NPXY motif has been reported to interact directly with clathrin ( Kibbey et al . , 1998 ) . In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae , two distinct classes of clathrin - facilitated endocytic targeting signals have been un - covered , one containing critical lysine residues , and the other consisting of the sequence NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) ( NPFX [ 1 , 2 ] D ) ( Rohrer et al . , 1993 ; Tan et al . , 1996 ) . The lysine - based sig - nal relies on ubiquitylation subsequent to local serine and threonine phosphorylation ( Hicke and Riezman , 1996 ; Hicke et al . , 1998 ) . Mono - ubiquitylation is sufficient to trigger endocytosis , in contrast to the polyubiquitin chains of four or more residues required for proteasome - mediated degradation ( Chau et al . , 1989 ; Galan and Haguenauer - Tsapis , Address correspondence to Gregory S .

Expanding evidence suggests that ubiquitin acts as an endocytic targeting signal in mammals as well as yeast , al - though the mechanism by which this signal directs cargo to the endocytic machinery is currently unclear ( Hicke , 2001 ) . The NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D signal was originally discovered in the cy - toplasmic domain of the furin - like protease Kex2p ( Tan et al . , 1996 ) . Kex2p cycles between the Golgi complex and en - dosomes without normally encountering the cell surface ( Wilcox et al . , 1992 ; Brickner and Fuller , 1997 ) . Despite this itinerary , the Kex2p cytoplasmic domain directs rapid endocytosis when fused to an endocytically inactive version of a cell surface protein , the (cid:4) - factor mating pheromone re - ceptor , Ste2p ( Tan et al . , 1996 ) . Mutational analysis of the Ste2p / Kex2p chimeric protein defined the sequence NPFSD as the endocytic targeting signal . Characterization of a simi - lar sequence , NPFSTD , naturally present in Ste3p ( the cell surface receptor for (cid:4) - factor mating pheromone ) , estab - lished NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D as a motif that can direct rapid internal - ization of an integral membrane protein that normally tran - sits the plasma membrane . The NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D motif shares sequence features with the mammalian NPXY endocytic targeting signal . Furthering this resemblance , phenylalanine can function in place of ty - rosine in the NPXY signal ( Davis et al . , 1987 ) . In addition , both motifs can direct clathrin - mediated uptake , raising the possibility that the two signals might function by similar mechanisms ( Davis et al . , 1986 ; Tan et al . , 1996 ) . An alter - native model derives from identification of NPF as a motif recognized by proteins bearing Eps15 homology ( EH ) do - mains ( Salcini et al . , 1997 ) . Involvement in endocytosis is a common characteristic of EH domain proteins , including Eps15 and the yeast proteins Pan1p , End3p , and Ede1p ( Benedetti et al . , 1994 ; Wendland et al . , 1996 ; Carbone et al . , 1997 ; Benmerah et al . , 1998 ; Gagny et al . , 2000 ) . Ac - cordingly , EH domain proteins are candidate endocytic adaptors for the NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D signal . Here we present in - depth mutational analysis of the NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D signal , indicating a closer relationship with EH domain ligands than with the NPXY endocytic targeting sig - nal . However , the NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D motif is not efficiently recog - nized by yeast EH domain proteins . Instead , we identified the actin - associated protein Sla1p as the component of the endocytic machinery that recognizes NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D . Sla1p binds NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D through a domain unrelated in sequence to EH domains . Our results suggest that Sla1p represents a novel type of endocytic adaptor that can link NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D - containing cargo to the actin and clathrin - based endocytic machinery in yeast . Results Conservative mutations in the NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D motif inhibit endocytosis NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D was originally defined as an endocytic targeting signal by introducing alanine substitution mutations into a Ste2p / Kex2p chimera and a truncated form of Ste3p ( Tan et al . , 1996 ) . However , in neither case was the targeting sig - nal demonstrated to function completely independently of other Kex2p or Ste3p sequences . Consequently , an 11 - aa se - quence containing NPFSD from Kex2p was appended to residue 318 of Ste2p , replacing most of the Ste2p COOH - terminal cytoplasmic domain ( Fig . 1 A , Ste2p (cid:5) 318 - NPFSD ) . Truncation of Ste2p at position 318 leaves phero - mone binding intact but eliminates the native endocytic targeting determinants ( Konopka et al . , 1988 ; Reneke et al . , 1988 ) . For comparison , a second construct was generated that carries the first five aa of the Kex2p sequence , but lacks the NPFSD signal ( Fig . 1 A , Ste2p (cid:5) 318 * ) . Ste2p (cid:5) 318 - NPFSD and Ste2p (cid:5) 318 * were introduced into cells lacking endogenous STE2 , and endocytosis was assessed by measur - Figure 1 .

Shaded rectangles represent the COOH - terminal region of Ste2p to aa 318 and the vertical black line represents the plasma membrane .

Analysis of NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) - mediated endocytosis | Howard et al . 317 ing uptake of radiolabelled (cid:4) - factor ( Fig . 1 , B and C ) . Ste2p (cid:5) 318 - NPFSD was rapidly internalized ( Fig . 1 C ) , al - beit not as efficiently as wild - type Ste2p ( compare Figs . 1 B and 2 A ) . In contrast , Ste2p (cid:5) 318 * was not internalized ( Fig . 1 C ) . These results indicate that the 11 - aa peptide encom - passing NPFSD functions autonomously to direct endocyto - sis in the absence of other Kex2p sequences . The NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D motif resembles two signals involved in the endocytic process , the mammalian NPXY endocytic tar - geting signal and the NPF ligand of EH domains . To exam - ine this relationship in more detail , we introduced muta - tions at selected sites in Ste2p (cid:5) 318 - NPFSD and measured endocytosis of the resulting constructs . Both NPXY and NPF peptides adopt type I (cid:7) turns in vitro and lose activity when proline is replaced with aa such as alanine or glycine that disfavor the turn conformation ( Chen et al . , 1990 ; Ban - sal and Gierasch , 1991 ; Salcini et al . , 1997 ; de Beer et al . , 2000 ) . Mutation of NPFSD to NPASD in the original Ste2p / Kex2p chimera eliminated internalization ( Tan et al . , 1996 ) . To extend this finding , we replaced proline with gly - cine in Ste2p (cid:5) 318 - NPFSD . The resulting mutant was in - ternalization - defective ( Fig . 1 B , NgFSD ) , consistent with a possible role for a (cid:7) turn conformation in endocytic target - ing by NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D . NPXY and NPF signals differ in de - pendence on aromatic residues ; tyrosine in NPXY can be functionally replaced by other aromatic aa , whereas phenyl - alanine in NPF cannot ( Davis et al . , 1987 ; Salcini et al . , 1997 ) . Mutation of phenylalanine to tyrosine or tryptophan in Ste2p (cid:5) 318 - NPFSD abolished endocytosis ( Fig . 1 B , NPySD and NPwSD ) . These results suggest that the NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D motif more closely resembles an EH domain ligand . In the context of the original Ste2p / Kex2p chimera , the aspartate in NPFSD is an important component of the sig - nal , although an aspartate to alanine mutant displayed a re - sidual level of endocytosis ( Tan et al . , 1996 ) . We tested the role of aspartate by substituting either alanine or glutamate in Ste2p (cid:5) 318 - NPFSD . In this receptor , the alanine muta - tion reduced endocytosis to background levels ( Fig . 1 C ) . More importantly , the glutamate mutation was also disrup - tive ( Fig . 1 C ) , establishing that aspartate , not simply a neg - atively charged side chain , is required for full endocytic tar - geting activity . Serine phosphorylation is required for ubiquitylation of the yeast lysine - based endocytic targeting signal and several serine and / or threonine kinases have been implicated in en - docytosis ( Hicke et al . , 1998 ; Cope et al . , 1999 ; Zeng and Cai , 1999 ) . Serine and / or threonine residues are located within and surrounding the NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D signals derived from Kex2p and Ste3p . To determine whether phosphorylation might influence efficacy of the NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D motif , serine and threonine residues were converted to alanine in Ste2p (cid:5) 318 - NPFSD . In the same construct , the glutamate preceding the NPFSD motif was also replaced with alanine . Alternatively , serine and threonine residues were changed to aspartate to mimic phosphoserine . Endocytosis of both mutants was normal ( unpublished data ) , arguing that local phosphoryla - tion / negative charge is not important for NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D target - ing activity . Native Ste2p contains a functional NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D - like motif Ste2p contains a sequence related to the NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D signal , GPFAD , beginning at residue 392 in the COOH - terminal cytoplasmic domain . We examined the endocytic targeting potential of this sequence in the context of the native recep - tor by introducing alanine ( inactivating ) or asparagine ( pos - sibly activating ) mutations at G392 . The alanine mutation did not affect Ste2p endocytosis ( Fig . 2 A ) . However , G392N resulted in a reproducible enhancement in uptake kinetics at the 5 - min time point ( Fig . 2 A ) , suggesting that the sequence contributes to endocytosis . Ste2p utilizes ubiquitin as an endocytic targeting determi - nant ( Hicke and Riezman , 1996 ) . Multiple Ste2p lysines can serve as ubiquitin acceptors , providing redundant endocytic targeting information ( Terrell et al . , 1998 ) . Also , there are ex - amples of proteins with more than one type of endocytic tar - Figure 2 . NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D directs rapid endocytosis in the absence of ubiquitin acceptor sites . Endocytosis of wild - type and mutant forms of Ste2p expressed in GPY779 were determined by measuring (cid:4) - factor uptake as described in the legend to Fig . 1 . 318 The Journal of Cell Biology | Volume 157 , Number 2 , 2002 geting signal ( Kirchhausen et al . , 1997 ) . Therefore , it was possible that ubiquitylation masks a role for the GFPAD se - quence in endocytosis . Accordingly , G392A and G392N were introduced into a version of Ste2p in which seven of eight COOH - terminal domain lysines were converted to ar - ginine ( Ste2p7KR ) to prevent ubiquitin conjugation while maintaining overall charge . The remaining lysine , K304 , does not suffice to direct internalization ( Fig . 1 C , Ste2p (cid:5) 318 * ) , and does not appear to be ubiquitylated ( Dunn and Hicke , 2001 ) . Ste2p7KR was internalized at initial rates four - to fivefold slower than wild - type ( Fig . 2 B ) . The G392A muta - tion further reduced the initial internalization rate about fourfold , whereas G392N increased internalization to a rate approaching that of wild - type Ste2p ( Fig . 2 B ) . Although Ste2p7KR does not appear to be ubiquitylated , it was formally possible that the remaining cytosolic lysines could act as low - level or transient ubiquitin acceptors . To as - sess this possibility , the G392A and G392N mutations were analyzed in a form of Ste2p in which arginines replaced all 11 cytoplasmic lysines ( Ste2p11KR ) . Ste2p11KR and Ste2p11KR - G392N were internalized (cid:2) 1 . 5 - fold more efficiently than the cognate 7KR versions ( Fig . 2 C ; unpublished data ) , for reasons that are currently unclear . However , internalization remained sensitive to the G392A mu - tation ( Fig . 2 C ) . Thus , NPFAD and GPFAD function in the absence of cytoplasmic lysines , indicating that NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D - mediated endocytosis does not require cargo ubiquitylation . Collectively , these data provide evidence that an NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D - related motif participates redundantly with ubiquitin in directing endocytosis of Ste2p . Although GPFAD directs endocytosis , glycine is less optimal than as - paragine at the first position . Consequently , Ste2p11KR - G392N and Ste2p - G392A represent sensitive reporters to distinguish NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D - and ubiquitin - dependent modes of endocytosis . Henceforth , we will refer to these reporters as Ste2p - NPFXD and Ste2p - Ub , respectively . NPFSD interacts with Sla1p To isolate an endocytic adaptor for the NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D signal , we carried out a yeast two - hybrid screen . We generated a bait that carried the cytoplasmic domain sequences from Ste2p (cid:5) 318 fused to three tandem copies of the 11 - residue Kex2p - derived NPFSD sequence ( Fig . 3 A ) . To eliminate activation of reporter genes by the NPFSD bait alone , glutamates in the Kex2p de - rived sequences were altered to alanine , a mutation that does not affect NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D - mediated endocytosis ( Tan et al . , 1996 ) . We reasoned that the triple repeat might improve chances of detecting interactions , as the initial internalization rate of Ste2p (cid:5) 318 - NPFSD was enhanced (cid:2) 2 . 5 - fold by adding two additional copies of the Kex2p NPFSD - containing sequence ( unpublished data ) . Using the triple - repeat bait we identified a plasmid carrying a fragment of the SLA1 gene , but no plasmids expressing EH domain proteins . SLA1 encodes a 1 , 244 - aa pro - tein implicated in actin dynamics ( Holtzman et al . , 1993 ; Ay - scough et al . , 1997 , 1999 ) . Furthermore , Sla1p interacts with Pan1p and End3p , two proteins that function in actin organiza - tion and endocytosis , suggesting a role for Sla1p in the en - docytic process ( Tang et al . , 2000 ) . Sla1p contains three NH 2 - terminal SH3 domains , a central region with a proline rich sequence flanked by two domains unrelated to each other but conserved in other fungal and plant species ( SLA1 homol - ogy domains [ SHDs ] ) , and multiple repeats of the sequence TGGXXXPQ in the COOH - terminal domain that potentially serve as phosphorylation sites ( Fig . 3 B ) ( Ayscough et al . , 1999 ; Zeng and Cai , 1999 ) . The fragment isolated in the two - hybrid screen spans aa 471 – 1185 , lacking the SH3 domains . Because an endocytic adaptor for NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D would be expected to interact only with an endocytically functional version of the motif , we compared interaction of the Sla1p fragment with NPFSD , or with endocytically defective vari - Figure 3 . NPFSD specifically interacts with the COOH - terminal region of Sla1p . ( A ) Bait constructs used in the two - hybrid analysis . Three repeats of the NPFSD signal linked by Ste2p aa298 – 318 to the Gal4p DNA binding domain ( GBD ) , and mutant versions shown below , were tested for interaction with the SLA1 fragment isolated in the two - hybrid screen . Interaction was assessed in PJ69 – 4A by growth of serial diluted cells at 30 (cid:6) C on synthetic media containing ( (cid:8) ADE ) or lacking ( (cid:9) ADE ) adenine . ( B ) Domain architecture of Sla1p . Indicated are SH3 domains , SLA1 homology domain 1 and 2 ( SHD1 and SHD2 ) , a predicted proline - rich SH3 binding site ( P ) , and multiple repeats of TGGXXXPQ ( vertical lines ) . The Sla1p frag - ment isolated from the two - hybrid screen ( K471 - T1185 ) is under - lined . ( C ) The Sla1p fragment and indicated EH - domain proteins were tested for interaction with NPFSD as in A . ( D ) Yeast EH - domain encoding genes were tested for interaction with YAP180 s as above . Analysis of NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) - mediated endocytosis | Howard et al . 319 ants , by two - hybrid analysis . As monitored by growth on se - lective media , two - hybrid interactions paralleled endocytic activity of the different sequences ; the Sla1p fragment inter - acted strongly with NPFSD , very weakly with NPFSE , and not at all with NPASD or NPWSD ( Fig . 3 A ) . We also tested NPFSD for interaction with each of the five EH domain - containing proteins encoded in S . cerevisiae . These proteins were of particular interest because of sequence similarities between the NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D signal and EH domain ligands , and because three of these proteins ( Pan1p , End3p , and Ede1p ) , are involved in endocytosis ( Benedetti et al . , 1994 ; Wendland et al . , 1996 ; Gagny et al . , 2000 ) . Using the two - hybrid assay , only the SLA1 fragment displayed interac - tion with NPFSD ( Fig . 3 C ) . In contrast , Pan1p interacted with Yap1801p and Yap1802p , two proteins with five NPF motifs each , none containing an aspartate at position (cid:8) 5 and only one containing an aspartate at (cid:8) 6 ( Fig . 3 D ) ( Wend - land and Emr , 1998 ) . Ede1p and End3p interacted with Yap1802p but not Yap1801p ( Fig . 3 D ) . These results imply that Sla1p uniquely recognizes the NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D motif . NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D - mediated endocytosis requires SLA1 The role of Sla1p in NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D - mediated endocytosis was investigated by evaluating the effects of disrupting SLA1 ( sla1 (cid:5) ) on internalization of Ste2p - G392N , Ste2p - NPFXD ( Ste2p11KR - G392N ) , and Ste2p - Ub ( Ste2p - G392A ) . Up - take of (cid:4) - factor mediated by Ste2p - NPFXD was abolished in sla1 (cid:5) cells ( Fig . 4 A ) . The effects of sla1 (cid:5) on Ste2p - G392N and Ste2p - Ub were far more subtle ; after a 5 - min lag , internalization of both receptors was essentially normal . Sla1p was also required for uptake directed by the native GPFAD sequence in Ste2p ( Fig . 4 B ) . The selectivity of sla1 (cid:5) effects on Ste2p - NPFXD and Ste2p - GPFXD supports the hypothesis that Sla1p acts as a specific endocytic adaptor for the NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D signal . However , the lag in ubiquitin - mediated endocytosis suggests Sla1p also participates more generally in the initiation of cargo internalization . A conserved domain of Sla1p binds NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D To define the region of Sla1p that interacts with NPFSD , deletion mutants of the SLA1 fragment were tested for NPFSD binding by two - hybrid analysis . The fragment iso - lated in the original two - hybrid screen extended from K471 to T1185 , encompassing the two SHD domains , the pro - line - rich sequence , and a majority of the COOH - terminal TGGXXXPQ repeats ( Fig . 5 A ) . Using (cid:7) - galactosidase ac - tivity as a measure of interaction , COOH - terminal excision of most of the fragment , leaving only K471 - E555 , produced little effect on NPFSD interaction ( Fig . 5 A ) . In contrast , an NH 2 - terminal truncation of 39 aa reduced (cid:7) - galactosidase activity to (cid:2) 10 % of the original fragment ( Fig . 5 A ) . These results suggest that the 84 aa between K471 and E555 con - tain an NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D interaction site . This fragment includes SHD1 ( P492 - G551 ) , first recognized as a domain of un - known function that is conserved in an orthologue of SLA1 from Schizosaccharomyces pombe ( Ayscough et al . , 1999 ) . ( It should be noted that SHD1 is distinct from a region in Pan1p containing TGGXXXPQ repeats that has been re - ferred to as a Sla1p homology domain [ Tang and Cai , 1996 ] . ) Affinity chromatography was used as an independent assessment of NPFSD binding by SHD1 . Glutathione - S - transferase ( GST ) fusion inserts to triple repeats of either NPFSD or NPASD were expressed in bacteria and purified by binding to glutathione - Sepharose . Equivalent amounts of the purified fusions were tested for binding to hexahistidine - tagged SHD1 ( S486 - E555 ) in Escherichia coli extracts ( Fig . 5 B ) , or purified SHD1 ( Fig . 5 C ) . SHD1 present in bacte - rial extract ( Fig . 5 B , lanes 1 and 3 , Immunoblot ) was en - riched in the bound fraction from GST - NPFSD but not GST - NPASD beads , as detected by Coomassie blue staining or immunoblotting with antibody to a hexahistidine tag ( Fig . 5 B , lanes 2 and 4 ) . Similarly , purified SHD1 bound preferentially to GST - NPFSD beads ( Fig . 5 C , lanes 2 and 3 ) . These results demonstrate that SHD1 can directly associ - ate with a NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D motif . Sla1p SHD1 is required for NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D - mediated endocytosis We designed a mutant of SLA1 lacking sequences encoding SHD1 ( P492 - G551 , sla1 - (cid:5) shd1 ) to examine the role of this domain in endocytosis . Centromere - based plasmids express - ing either SLA1 or sla1 - (cid:5) shd1 were introduced into sla1 (cid:5) cells and Sla1p expression was monitored by immunoblot - Figure 4 . NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D - mediated endocytosis requires SLA1 . ( A and B ) Centromere plasmids encoding Ste2p - G392N , Ste2p - NPFXD ( Ste2p11KR - G392N ) , and Ste2p - GPFXD ( Ste2p11KR ) were intro - duced into SLA1 cells ( GPY2490 , GPY2454 , and GPY2665 ) , and the same plasmids plus Ste2p - Ub ( Ste2p - G392A ) were introduced into sla1 (cid:5) cells ( GPY2487 , GPY 2488 , GPY2489 , GPY2451 , and GPY2666 ) . Endocytosis was monitored by (cid:4) - factor uptake as described in the legend to Fig . 1 . 320 The Journal of Cell Biology | Volume 157 , Number 2 , 2002 ting . The results indicated that deletion of SHD1 does not destabilize Sla1p ( unpublished data ) . We then compared en - docytosis of Ste2p - G392N , Ste2p - NPFXD , and Ste2p - Ub in sla1 - (cid:5) shd1 cells to Ste2p - G392N endocytosis in wild - type cells . As shown in Fig . 6 A , internalization of Ste2p - G392N and Ste2p - Ub in sla1 - (cid:5) shd1 cells lagged only at the 5 - min time point compared to the wild - type control . The delay was less pronounced than that observed for the same receptors in sla1 (cid:5) cells ( compare Figs . 4 and 6 A ) . However , uptake of Ste2p - NPFXD was essentially eliminated ( Fig . 6 A ) , as was uptake of Ste2p - GPFXD ( unpublished data ) , equivalent to the effects of deleting the entire SLA1 gene ( Fig . 4 ) . Other Sla1p - related phenotypes were monitored to probe the specificity of sla1 - (cid:5) shd1 effects on NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D - mediated endocytosis . Deletion of SLA1 leads to temperature - sensitive growth at 37 (cid:6) C and defects in organization of the actin cyto - skeleton ( Holtzman et al . , 1993 ) . As shown in Fig . 6 B , SLA1 or sla1 - (cid:5) shd1 expressed from centromere - based plas - mids fully restored growth at 37 (cid:6) C , whereas vector alone did not . Similarly , sla1 (cid:5) - shd1 was comparable to SLA1 in sup - pressing the loss in number and intensity of cortical actin patches in sla1 (cid:5) cells ( Fig . 6 C ) . These results provide evi - dence that deletion of SHD1 specifically compromises NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D - mediated endocytosis , whereas other Sla1p ac - tivities remain intact . Discussion We have characterized sequence requirements for endocytic targeting by the motif NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D and uncovered a novel role for Sla1p as an adaptor for NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D - mediated internaliza - tion in yeast . A role for Sla1p in endocytosis is further sup - ported by previous studies documenting physical interactions of Sla1p with End3p and Pan1p , two components of the gen - eral actin - based endocytic machinery in yeast ( Tang et al . , 1997 , 2000 ) . We propose that Sla1p can act as an endocytic adaptor , coupling NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D - containing cargo to the en - docytic machinery by its ability to bind the NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D tar - geting signal , End3p , and Pan1p . To our knowledge , Sla1p represents the first example of a protein involved in recogni - tion of endocytic targeting signals in yeast . SHD1 : a novel NPF - binding domain Our results identify the Sla1p SHD1 as a novel NPF - bind - ing domain , unrelated in primary structure to NPF - binding EH domains . Some basic characteristics of NPF recognition by SHD1 can be inferred from analysis of endocytic target - ing by the NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D signal and from two - hybrid interac - tion studies . Recognition can occur relatively independent of NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D position within the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor constructs tested , as close as 20 aa from the membrane spanning domain in Ste2p (cid:5) 318 - NPFSD , or as far as 96 aa from the membrane spanning domain of Ste2p - NPFXD . Several sequence features of NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D appear to be especially important for SHD1 binding . Previous alanine mutagenesis identified key residues at positions 1 – 3 and 5 in NPFSD ( Tan et al . , 1996 ) . Our current results indicate a preference for asparagine over glycine at position 1 , and Figure 5 . NPFSD interacts specifically with the SHD1 region of Sla1p . ( A ) Two - hybrid analysis of the NPFSD - interacting region of Sla1p . Fragments encoded by the original SLA1 clone isolated in the two - hybrid screen ( 471 – 1 , 185 ) and two deletion mutants are diagrammed . Numbers indicate the amino acid boundaries of Sla1p fused to the Gal4p activation domain . Each construct was tested for interaction with active ( NPF ) and inactive ( NPA ) versions of the Kex2p - derived signal by measuring (cid:7) - galactosidase activity ( units (cid:10) 10 3 ) in cell extracts . ( B ) GST - fusion protein affinity chromatography of SHD1 from cell extracts . Triple repeats of active ( NPF ) and inactive ( NPA ) forms of the 11 aa Kex2p - derived signal joined to Ste2p residues 298 – 318 were fused to GST and expressed in E . coli . Fusion proteins bound to glutathione - Sepharose were incubated with extracts from E . coli cells expressing hexahistidine - tagged SHD1 . Bound proteins were eluted with reduced glutathione , separated by SDS - PAGE , and visualized by staining with Coomassie blue or by immunoblotting with antibodies against hexahistidine epitope . Positions of molecular mass standards ( in kD ) , GST fusions , SHD1 , and an apparently dimeric form of SHD1 ( * ) are indicated . Input represents 0 . 5 % of the extract used for the incubations with GST fusions . ( C ) SHD1 purified as described in Materials and methods was tested for interactions with GST - NPASD ( NPA ) or GST - NPFSD ( NPF ) as described in B . Eluted proteins were subjected to SDS - PAGE and detected by Coomassie blue staining . Input represents 30 % of purified SHD1 incubated with GST fusions . Analysis of NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) - mediated endocytosis | Howard et al . 321 strict requirements for phenylalanine rather than tryptophan and tyrosine at position 3 , and aspartate instead of glutamate at position 5 . The sequence requirements at positions 1 – 3 are similar to EH domain ligands and consistent with the type I – like (cid:7) turn conformation observed in the solution structure of an NPF peptide bound to the second EH do - main of Eps15 ( de Beer et al . , 2000 ) . Accordingly , we sug - gest that the NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D signal binds to SHD1 in a confor - mation similar to a type I (cid:7) turn with intimate hydrophilic contacts through the aspartate at position 5 or 6 . The NPFSD signal interacted with SHD1 but not EH do - main – containing proteins . For EH domains , residues flanking NPF can influence specificity for different domains ( Paoluzi et al . , 1998 ) . Of the EH domains from yeast proteins impli - cated in endocytosis ( Pan1p , End3p , and Ede1p ) , only the second EH domain of Pan1p preferentially selected NPFXD peptides from a phage display library ( Paoluzi et al . , 1998 ) . However , this binding was reportedly weaker than other EH domain – NPF interactions . Thus , aspartate may play a key role in determining the preference of NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D for SHD1 rather than EH domains , although other surrounding residues may also contribute to binding specificity . After discovery of the NPFSD endocytic targeting signal in Kex2p , we sought the motif in proteins that normally un - dergo endocytosis . Two such proteins , Ste2p and Ste3p , con - tain NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D and ubiquitin - based signals , although the apparent contributions differ in the two receptors . In Ste2p , these two signals appear to function in both pheromone - stimulated and constitutive uptake ( Hicke et al . , 1998 ; un - published data ) . In Ste3p , the NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D signal is particu - larly important for pheromone - stimulated internalization ( Tan et al . , 1996 ) . A search of the Saccharomyces Genome Database revealed seven established or putative plasma mem - brane proteins with the sequence [ G , N ] PFX ( 1 - 2 ) D , suggesting that the NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D motif , either alone or with ubiquitin - based signals , potentially directs endocytosis of a subset of cell surface proteins . Diversification provided by NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D sig - nals could allow special regulatory inputs , or increase overall endocytic efficiency by contributing contacts to the endocytic machinery distinct from those of other signals . Furthermore , the targeting function of NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D may not be limited to endocytosis , as the signal was first identified in Kex2p , a pro - tein that cycles between the Golgi and endosomes without normally transiting the cell surface . Therefore , it is possible that Sla1p SHD1 interactions with NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D signals play roles at multiple protein sorting steps . Sla1p : an endocytic adaptor SLA1 was originally uncovered in a screen for mutations that result in lethality when combined with a deletion of the gene encoding the actin binding protein Abp1p ( Holtzman et al . , 1993 ) . Characterization of sla1 mutants and Sla1p interac - tion partners indicate a role for Sla1p in actin cytoskeleton dynamics ( Ayscough et al . , 1997 , 1999 ; Li , 1997 ; Madania et al . , 1999 ; Drees et al . , 2001 ) . Importantly , Tang et al . ( 2000 ) have provided evidence that Sla1p forms a complex with Pan1p and End3p , two proteins essential for endocytosis . Our results extend the connection of Sla1p to endocytosis by demonstrating the role of the SHD1 domain in NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D - mediated internalization . Considering these findings , we pro - pose that the Sla1p / Pan1p / End3p complex serves as an endocytic adaptor complex linking cargo to the actin and clathrin - based endocytic machinery in yeast ( Fig . 7 ) . The Sla1p component of the Sla1p / Pan1p / End3p com - plex has the capacity to bridge NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D - containing cargo with the actin cytoskeleton . Deletion of SLA1 disrupts actin organization , a phenotype primarily attributable to the re - gion encompassing the most COOH - terminal SH3 domain ( Holtzman et al . , 1993 ; Ayscough et al . , 1999 ) . This region may be particularly important in mediating interactions Figure 6 . NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D mediated endocytosis requires SHD1 . ( A ) Effects of deleting Sla1p SHD1 on receptor mediated endocytosis . Uptake of Ste2p - G392N , Ste2p - Ub ( Ste2p - G392A ) , or Ste2p - NPFXD ( Ste2p11KR - G392N ) was measured in sla1 - (cid:5) shd1 cells ( GPY 2493 , GPY2494 , and GPY 2495 ) and Ste2p - G392N in SLA1 cells ( GPY2490 ) as in Fig . 1 . ( B ) Effects of deleting Sla1p SHD1 on growth . GPY2448 ( sla1 (cid:5) ) was transformed with centromeric plasmids containing no insert ( vector ) , wild - type SLA1 , or sla1 - (cid:5) shd1 and the resulting strains ( GPY2487 , GPY 2490 , and GPY 2493 , respectively ) plus wild - type strain GPY1805 were serially diluted onto synthetic media and examined for growth after 3 d at the indicated temperatures .

Additionally , Pan1p functions as an activator of the ARP2 / 3 complex , a key factor in actin polymerization ( Duncan et al . , 2001 ) . Like other ARP2 / 3 activators , Pan1p contains a motif consisting of an acidic aa stretch followed by a tryptophan . Mutation of this sequence affected Pan1p activity in vivo , and ARP2 / 3 activation in vitro ( Duncan et al . , 2001 ) . Interestingly , Sla1p also harbors three versions of the acidic aa tryptophan motif , two within SH3 domains and another COOH - terminal to SHD1 ( Fig . 7 ) . Therefore , the Sla1p / Pan1p / End3p complex could stim - ulate actin polymerization by Pan1p - and / or Sla1p - mediated ARP2 / 3 complex activation ( Fig . 7 ) . Sla1p also interacts , di - rectly or indirectly with Las17p , and genetically with Abp1p , two additional proteins that stimulate the ARP2 / 3 complex ( Fig . 7 ) ( Holtzman et al . , 1993 ; Li , 1997 ; Winter et al . , 1999 ; Goode et al . , 2001 ) . Perhaps formation of an endocytic vesicle requires a high level of ARP2 / 3 stimulatory activity , provided through presentation of multiple activa - tors by the Sla1p / Pan1p / End3 complex . In this scenario , the unusual lag observed in uptake of Ste2p - G392N and Ste2p - Ub in Sla1p - deficient cells could result from a delay in effec - tive ARP2 / 3 activation . Members of the Sla1p / Pan1p / End3p complex also inter - act with clathrin - associated proteins ( Fig . 7 ) . Through its second EH domain , Pan1p binds yeast epsins ( Ent1p and Ent2p ) and AP180s ( Yap1801p and Yap1802p ) , presum - ably by recognizing NPF motifs within these proteins ( Wendland and Emr , 1998 ; Wendland et al . , 1999 ) . Our two - hybrid results suggest that End3p can also associate with Ap1802p . In turn , yeast epsins and AP180s interact with clathrin , likely through COOH - terminal clathrin - binding motifs ( Wendland and Emr , 1998 ; Wendland et al . , 1999 ) . Epsins and AP180s contain NH 2 - terminal ENTH domains , which in mammalian proteins have been reported to mediate binding to phosphatidyl 4 , 5 bisphosphate ( Ford et al . , 2001 ; Itoh et al . , 2001 ; Mao et al . , 2001 ) . Consider - ing these interactions in sum , the Sla1p / Pan1p / End3p com - plex can coordinate a network linking the vesicle coat pro - tein clathrin to the plasma membrane and endocytic cargo . Mutations of clathrin generally have less severe effects on endocytosis than mutations affecting actin cytoskeleton components . However , clathrin inactivation decreases inter - nalization rates of different receptors ( including NPFX [ 1 , 2 ] D - dependent proteins ) between two - and fivefold ( Tan et al . , 1993 , 1996 ; Payne et al . , 1988 ) . These results , and the well - established role of clathrin in mammalian cell endocytosis , argue that clathrin coat formation at least facilitates endocy - tosis in yeast . Through the interactions shown in Fig . 7 , the Sla1p / Pan1p / End3p complex has the potential to couple cargo collection to clathrin coat formation , similar to the mammalian AP - 2 clathrin adaptor complex . Database searches for homologues of Sla1p or the SHD1 domain identify significant matches in several fungal species and Arabidopsis , but not other organisms for which sequence information is available . However , there are provocative par - allels between the Sla1p / Pan1p / End3p complex and a pro - tein network coordinated by Eps15 , raising the possibility of an analogous complex in mammals . Pan1p and Eps15 simi - larly consist of multiple NH 2 - terminal EH domains , central predicted coiled - coil regions , and proline - rich COOH ter - mini , and both participate in endocytosis ( Wendland et al . , 1996 ; Carbone et al . , 1997 ; Tang et al . , 1997 ; Benmerah et al . , 1998 ) . Eps15 interacts with intersectin , a protein with two NH 2 - terminal EH domains , and five COOH - terminal SH3 domains that has also been implicated in endocytosis ( Yamabhai et al . , 1998 ; Sengar et al . , 1999 ; Simpson et al . , 1999 ) . Like Sla1p , intersectin combines NPF recognition modules with SH3 domains . Furthermore , through its EH domains , intersectin recognizes NPFXD sequences in a cytoplasmic domain of the integral membrane protein , SCAMP1 ( Fernandez - Chacon et al . , 2000 ) . Importantly , the NPFXD motifs in SCAMP1 can interact with intersec - tin EH domains , but not Eps15 EH domains , a selectivity mirroring preferential association of NPFX ( 1 , 2 ) D with SHD1 over Pan1p EH domains . Therefore , the intersectin EH do - main and the Sla1p SHD1 domain may exemplify conver - gent evolution for ligand binding specificity , suggesting that Sla1p and intersectin may be , at least in part , functionally homologous . As we have proposed for the Sla1p / Pan1p / End3p complex , the Eps15 / intersectin complex has the potential to couple NPFXD - containing cargo to the actin cytoskeleton and clath - rin - coats . One such cargo could be SCAMP1 , as it cycles through the plasma membrane and interacts with intersectin through NPFXD sequences ( Brand et al . , 1991 ; Brand and Castle , 1993 ) . Eps15 and intersectin each contain candidate acidic aa tryptophan ARP2 / 3 activation sequences . Addition - ally , a splice variant of intersectin contains a DBL homology domain that stimulates actin polymerization through Cdc42 nucleotide exchange activity ( Hussain et al . , 2001 ) . Interac - tions with clathrin coats could be mediated by EH domains in both Eps15 and intersectin that bind epsins ( Chen et al . , 1998 ; Yamabhai et al . , 1998 ; Sengar et al . , 1999 ) , and SH3 domains in intersectin that bind proline - rich domains of Figure 7 .

Also , Eps15 binds AP - 2 ( Benmerah et al . , 1995 ) . Thus , the interaction networks radi - ating from the Sla1p / Pan1p / End3p and Eps15 / intersectin complexes incorporate common functional targets . Based on the models derived from our studies , it should now be possi - ble to test the extent of functional analogy between these com - ponents of the endocytic machinery in yeast and mammals . Materials and methods General methods and media General molecular biology methods were performed as described ( Sam - brook et al . , 1989 ) . PCR amplifications were performed with Elongase ( In - vitrogen ) , and automated sequencing carried out with ABI Prism ® Big Dye TM Terminators Cycle Sequencing Kit ( Applied Biosystems ) . All PCR products were sequenced to confirm accurate amplification . Yeast extract peptone dextrose media ( YPD ) and synthetic media ( SD and SD CAA ) have been described previously ( Tan et al . , 1996 ) . Strains and plasmids Table 1 describes the strains used in this study . Plasmids pEK3 ( sst1 : : LYS2 ) , a gift from Howard Riezman ( University of Basel , Basel , Switzerland ) and pAB506 ( ste2 : : LEU2 ) , a gift from James Konopka ( University of Oregon , Eugene , OR ) were used for single - step gene replacements ( Rothstein , 1991 ) after cleavage with Eco RI and Bam HI , respectively . SLA1 was dis - rupted by generating two overlapping PCR fragments and cotransforma - tion . DNA was introduced into yeast strains by a lithium acetate protocol ( Woods and Gietz , 2001 ) . Plasmids used in this study were constructed as follows . pJH106 ( pRS314 - STE2 ) : a 1 . 3 - kb Hpa I / Sac I fragment from pJR3 ( Rohrer et al . , 1993 ) was inserted into pRS314 - STEX22 ( Tan et al . , 1996 ) , resulting in re - placement of the Kex2p cytoplasmic domain with the native Ste2p cyto - plasmic domain . pJH108 ( pRS314 - STE2 - 7KR ) : the analogous Hpa I / Sac I fragment from a plasmid - encoding mutant ste2 ( ste2 - 7xR ) ( Terrell et al . , 1998 ) was inserted into pJH106 , introducing lysine to arginine mutations in the last seven lysine residues of Ste2p . G392A and G392N mutations were generated by the megaprimer method ( Sarkar and Sommer , 1990 ) and introduced into pJH106 and pJH108 . pJH108 - 11KR : a 0 . 94 - kb Hpa I / Pst I fragment from LHP409 , a gift from Linda Hicke ( Northwestern Univer - sity , Evanston , IL ) , was inserted into pJH108 plasmids , altering the remain - ing cytosolic lysines to arginines . pJH121 ( pRS314 - STE2 (cid:5) 318 - NPFSD ) : a PCR product encoding the sequence VLTNENPFSDP * fused to aa 318 of Ste2p was introduced into the Cla I / Hind III sites of pRS314 - STEX2h ( Tan et al . , 1996 ) . This insertion replaces the Kex2p cytoplasmic tail in a Ste2p / Kex2p fusion with VLTNENPFSDP * . In addition , a PCR product containing (cid:2) 500 bp of the KEX2 3 (cid:11) untranslated region was introduced into the Hind III site . Point mutations in Ste2p (cid:5) 318 - NPFSD were similarly engineered by PCR using mutant primers . pJH122 ( pRS314 - STE2 (cid:5) 318 * ) was derived by a similar strategy with a PCR product encoding VLTNE * fused to aa 318 of Ste2p . pKA51 ( pRS313 - SLA1 ) is described in Ayscough et al . ( 1999 ) . pKA51 (cid:5) shd1 : deletion of Sla1p aa 492 – 551 was generated using the megaprimer method and insertion into the Apa I and Aat II sites of pKA51 . pGBD - NPFSDx3 : a PCR product encoding aa 298 – 318 of Ste2p fused to the sequence VLTNANPFSDP repeated three times in tandem was inserted into pGBD - C1 ( James et al . , 1996 ) . Plasmids containing mutant versions of the targeting signal were constructed similarly . Complementary plasmids in pGAD - C1 ( James et al . , 1996 ) were generated using fragments from pGBD plasmids . Yeast two - hybrid plasmids encoding NH 2 - terminal re - gions of Pan1p and Ede1p , and full - length Yap1801p and Yap1802p , are described in Wendland and Emr ( 1998 ) . Yeast two - hybrid plasmids con - taining END3 , IRS4 , and YJL083w were generated by PCR amplification of genomic DNA and insertion into pGBD - C1 . pGEX - KG - NP ( F / A ) SD : the cor - responding sequences from pGBD - NP ( F / A ) SDx3 were amplified by PCR and inserted into pGEX - KG ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) , to generate GST fused NH 2 - terminal to NP ( F / A ) SDx3 ( as above ) . pET21 - SHD1 : the re - gion of SLA1 encoding K471 to E555 was amplified by PCR and inserted into pET21b ( Novagen ) , introducing a COOH - terminal hexahistidine tag . p926 - SHD1 : the region of SLA1 encoding K482 to E555 was amplified by PCR and inserted into p926 , a gift from Jean L . Perry ( University of Califor - nia , Los Angeles , Los Angeles , CA ) . This plasmid encodes a TEV protease cleavage site separating an NH 2 - terminal hexahistidine tag from SHD1 . Yeast two - hybrid screen Strain PJ69 - 4A was cotransformed with genomic DNA libraries in pGAD yeast two - hybrid vectors ( James et al . , 1996 ) and plasmid pGBD - NPFSDx3 , and incubated on SD agar plates lacking adenine for up to 2 wk at 30 (cid:6) C . More than 2 (cid:10) 10 6 transformants were plated for each reading frame , covering the entire library at a (cid:12) 99 % confidence level . Bait plas - Table I .

Cells cured of bait vector were retransformed with either pGBD - NPFSDx3 , or versions carrying mutations of the signal , and examined for growth on SD plates lacking adenine or histidine . No prey genes were isolated more than once , suggesting that the screen was not carried out to saturation . Other than SLA1 , there were no other isolates likely to be involved in endocytosis or other protein trafficking steps . Liquid (cid:7) - galactosidase assays were performed as described ( Breeden and Nasmyth , 1987 ) . Units were calculated as ( 1 , 000 (cid:10) OD 420 ) / ( [ ml ex - tract ] (cid:10) [ incubation time { min } ] (cid:10) [ protein concentration extract { mg / ml } ] ) . To assess relative growth on agar plates , freshly transformed PJ69 - 4A cells were grown overnight to stationary phase in SD CAA – trp - leu media , di - luted to 1 (cid:10) 10 7 cells / ml , and then tenfold serially diluted . Dilutions were spotted onto SD plates with or without adenine and incubated at 30 (cid:6) C for 5 d . Images were collected on a SPEEDLIGHT PLATINUM gel documenta - tion system ( Lightools Research ) and adjusted using standard settings in Adobe Photoshop ( Adobe Systems ) . Preparation of 35 S - labeled (cid:4) - factor Metabolically labeled (cid:4) - factor was prepared and purified from filtered cul - ture supernatant over a cellulose - phosphate column essentially as de - scribed ( Tan et al . , 1993 ) , using strain RK537 - 3B , a gift from Kendall Blumer ( Washington University School of Medicine , St .

The assay for binding and internalization of 35 S - labelled (cid:4) - factor was performed essentially as that described ( Tan et al . , 1996 ) , except that internalization was carried out in 1 % Bacto - yeast extract ( Difco ) , 2 % Bacto - peptone ( Difco ) , 50 mM PO 4 , pH 6 , 1 % BSA , 20 (cid:3) g / ml histidine , adenine and uracil ) and dextrose was added to 5 % to initiate endocytosis . Percent uptake is 100 (cid:10) the ratio of ( internal CPM - background CPM / bound CPM - background CPM ) . All samples were measured in duplicate , and each exper - iment performed at least three times . GST fusion affinity binding pGEX - KG - NPFSDx3 and pGEX - KG - NPASDx3 were expressed in bacterial strain BL21 ( DE3 ) , and GST fusion proteins were affinity purified with glu - tathione - Sepharose ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) as described in Smith and Johnson ( 1988 ) . pET21b - SHD1 was induced by 0 . 1 M IPTG for 16 h at 18 (cid:6) C and cells were lysed by sonication . Lysates were incubated with GST - NPFSD or GST - NPASD beads overnight at 4 (cid:6) C . Bound proteins were resolved by SDS - PAGE on a 15 % gel , and visualized by Coomassie blue stain or immunoblotting ( Burnette , 1981 ) with anti - pentaHis antibody ( QIAGEN ) and secondary antibodies coupled to HRP ( Bio - Rad Laborato - ries ) . HRP was visualized using enhanced chemilumenescence ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) . p926 - SHD1 was expressed and purified as described ( Pettit et al . , 1998 ) , except that protein expression was induced for 12 h at 18 (cid:6) C . To remove the NH 2 - terminal tag , purified protein was dialyzed into Tris buffer ( 20 mM Tris , 10 % [ vol / vol ] glycerol , pH 8 . 0 ) using Spectra / Por dialysis membrane 2 ( Spectrum ) , and then treated with rTEV protease ( In - vitrogen ) for 1 h at 30 (cid:6) C in TEV cleavage buffer ( 50 mM Tris , 0 . 5 mM EDTA , and 1 mM DTT . pH 8 . 0 ) . KCl was added to a final concentration of 100 mM , and then cleaved tag and recombinant protease were removed by incubation with Ni - NTA beads ( QIAGEN ) for 20 min at 4 (cid:6) C . Binding experiments with GST fusion proteins were carried out as above , except that the incubation step was performed for 20 min at 4 (cid:6) C . Samples were resolved by SDS - PAGE analysis on a 20 % gel ( Giulian et al . , 1983 ) and vi - sualized by Coomassie blue staining . Images were collected by laser den - sitometry and adjusted using standard settings in Adobe Photoshop . Temperature - sensitive growth assay Cells grown to stationary phase in SD CAA media at 30 (cid:6) C were diluted to 1 (cid:10) 10 6 cells / ml , and then tenfold serially diluted .
