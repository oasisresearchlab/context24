The actin cytoskeleton of the growth cone underlies the formation of lamellipodia and filopodia that control growth cone outgrowth and guidance . The role of the Arp2 / 3 complex in growth cone filopodia formation has been controversial , and other mechanisms of growth cone filopodia formation remain to be described . Results : Here we show that mutations in genes encoding the Arp2 / 3 complex ( arx genes ) caused defects in axon guidance . Analysis of developing growth cones in vivo showed that arx mutants displayed defects in filopodia and reduced growth cone size . Time - lapse analysis of growth cones in living animals indicated that arx mutants affected the rate of growth cone filopodia formation but not filopodia stability or length . Two other actin modulatory proteins , UNC - 115 / abLIM and UNC - 34 / Enabled , that had been shown previously to affect axon guidance had overlapping roles with Arp2 / 3 in axon guidance and also affected the rate of filopodia initiation but not stability or length . Conclusion : Our results indicate that the Arp2 / 3 complex is required cell - autonomously for axon guidance and growth cone filopodia initiation . Furthermore , they show that two other actin - binding proteins , UNC - 115 / abLIM and UNC - 34 / Enabled , also control growth cone filopodia formation , possibly in parallel to Arp2 / 3 . These studies indicate that , in vivo , multiple actin modulatory pathways including the Arp2 / 3 complex contribute to growth cone filopodia formation during growth cone outgrowth . Background The growth cone of a developing axon senses and responds to extracellular cues , resulting in the migration of the growth cone and thus axon to its correct target region in the nervous system [ 1 , 2 ] . Growth cones display dynamic , actin - based lamellipodial protrusions ringed by filopodia that together guide the growth cone to its target [ 3 - 5 ] . The Arp2 / 3 complex is a seven - member protein complex that nucleates actin filaments from the sides of pre - existing actin filaments . In cultured cells , the Arp2 / 3 complex is necessary to form the network of branched actin filaments underlying lamellipodia [ 6 - 8 ] .

In Drosophila , the Arp2 / 3 complex and its regulators WAVE / Scar and Kette are required for proper axon pathfinding [ 9 ] , and in Caenorhabditis elegans , the Arp2 / 3 regulators WAVE - 1 / WAVE , WASP - 1 / WASP , GEX - 2 / Sra - 1 , and GEX - 3 / Kette are required for proper axon guidance [ 10 ] . However , in these studies , the effects of Arp2 / 3 on growth cone outgrowth were not described . The role of the Arp2 / 3 complex in growth cone morphol - ogy has been controversial . In two studies using cultured hippocampal neurons , inhibition of Arp2 / 3 activity resulted in increased axon length with little or no effect on growth cone filopodia or morphology [ 11 , 12 ] . Another recent study using cultured hippocampal neurons and neuroblastoma cells showed that Arp2 / 3 knock - down resulted in defective actin organization and defective lamellipodia and filopodia formation in the growth cone [ 13 ] . Studies reported here show that Arp2 / 3 is indeed required for growth cone morphology and filopodia for - mation in vivo , and that Arp2 / 3 is required specifically for the rate of filopodia initiation but not filopodial stability or length . Thus , our studies demonstrate that Arp2 / 3 is required for growth cone filopodia formation and extend these findings in vivo , explaining the axon pathfinding defects observed in Arp2 / 3 mutants . Furthermore , UNC - 115 / abLIM has been implicated in axon pathfinding in C . elegans [ 14 - 16 ] and Drosophila [ 17 ] , but its role in growth cone dynamics and morphology during outgrowth is not understood . Our results here show that UNC - 115 / abLIM is also involved in the initiation of growth cone filopodia . Experiments described here in C . elegans show that muta - tions in genes encoding subunits of the Arp2 / 3 complex ( arx genes ) cause defects in axon guidance , and that Arp2 / 3 is required cell - autonomously in neurons for proper axon guidance . Analysis of growth cones during out - growth in vivo revealed that arx mutants displayed reduced numbers of growth cone filopodia and also reduced growth cone size . Time - lapse analysis of growth cones in living animals indicated that the Arp2 / 3 complex control - led the rate of growth cone filopodia initiation but not filopodia stability or length . These results indicate that , in C . elegans , the Arp2 / 3 complex is a key regulator of growth cone filopodia initiation during outgrowth . The actin modulatory proteins UNC - 34 / Enabled and UNC - 115 / abLIM have been shown previously to affect axon guidance in C . elegans [ 15 , 16 , 18 ] . Enabled is a key regulator of filopodia formation in many systems , includ - ing neurons , and is thought to act by blocking actin - cap - ping activity , thus allowing for long filament growth in filopodia [ 19 , 20 ] , although recent studies indicate that Enabled might have anti - capping independent roles [ 21 ] that are involved in filopodia formation [ 22 ] . The actin binding protein UNC - 115 / abLIM controls axon pathfinding and lamellipodia and filopodia formation in cultured cells and in C . elegans neurons [ 14 , 15 , 23 ] . We show here that unc - 115 also caused defects in growth cone filopodia initiation and growth cone size , similar to arx . The role of Enabled in growth cone filopodia formation has been described previously , and we found that UNC - 34 / Enabled affected growth cone filopodia initiation , but did not affect filopodial growth or stability once a filopo - dium formed . This is in contrast to previous studies that indicated that Enabled also affected filopodial elongation [ 19 ] . In sum , our results indicate that three distinct actin modulatory molecules , Arp2 / 3 , UNC - 115 / abLIM , and UNC - 34 / Enabled , control filopodia initiation in growth cones in vivo that are required for proper axon guidance Materials and methods Genetic methods All experiments were performed at 20°C using standard C . elegans techniques [ 24 ] . The following mutations and transgenic constructs were used : X : unc - 115 ( mn481 and ky275 ) , lqIs2 [ osm - 6 : : gfp ] , mig - 2 ( mu28 ) ; I : arx - 7 ( ok1118 ) , hT2 [ bli - 4 ( e937 ) let - ? ( q782 ) qIs48 ] ( I ; III ) , lqIs40 [ gcy - 32 : : gfp ] ; II : juIs76 [ unc - 25 : : gfp ] ; III : arx - 4 ( ok1093 ) , sC1 [ dpy - 1 ( s2170 ) ] ; IV : ced - 10 ( n1993 ) , lqIs3 [ osm - 6 : : gfp ] , nT1 [ qIs51 ] ( IV ; V ) ; V : arx - 2 ( ok1269 ) , unc - 34 ( e951 ) . The chro - mosomal locations of lqIs49 [ gcy - 32 : : gfp ] and lqIs75 [ gcy - 32 : : arx - 7 : : mCherry ] were not determined . The arx - 2 ( + ) , arx - 4 ( + ) , and arx - 7 ( + ) whole - gene regions were main - tained as extrachromosomal arrays . Extrachromosomal arrays were generated by germ line microinjection and integrated into the genome by standard techniques [ 25 ] . arx - 2 , arx - 4 , and arx - 7 mutations were balanced by the rearrangements nT1 , sC1 , and hT2 , respectively . nT1 and hT2 harbored transgenes that drove gfp expression in the pharynx , whereas sC1 had no gfp marker . arx - 2 and arx - 7 homozygotes were identified by lack of pharyngeal green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) , whereas arx - 4 homozygotes were identified by the protruding vulva ( Pvl ) phenotype in young adults . arx - 4 L1 larvae were not imaged because they could not be unambiguously identified as could arx - 2 and arx - 7 . Double mutants with ced - 10 were confirmed by the gonad misrouting phenotype and by the persistent cell corpse phenotype [ 26 ] , and double mutants with mig - 2 were confirmed by the gonad misrouting phenotype [ 27 ] . Double mutants with unc - 34 and unc - 115 were con - firmed by the uncoordinated phenotype of these mutants . arx transgene construction The arx - 2 , arx - 4 , and arx - 7 genes were amplified by PCR from wild - type N2 genomic DNA ( Figure 1 ) . The coding regions and splice junctions were sequenced to ensure that no mutations were introduced by PCR . The sequences Neural Development 2009 , 4 : 38 http : / / www . neuraldevelopment . com / content / 4 / 1 / 38 Page 3 of 20 ( page number not for citation purposes ) of all primers and amplified regions used in this work are available upon request . For cell - specific rescue , the coding regions of arx - 4 and arx - 7 ( from the initiator methionine to the stop codon ) were amplified from N2 genomic DNA and placed behind the osm - 6 promoter to drive PDE expression , or the gcy - 32 promoter to drive PQR expression . For arx - 7 , the stop codon was not included , and the coding region was fused in frame to the coding region for GFP . Analysis of PDE axon guidance defects As previously described , PDE axons were visualized with an osm - 6 promoter : : gfp transgene [ 15 ] . osm - 6 : : gfp , expressed in all ciliated sensory neurons including PDE , allows unambiguous identification of the PDE axon from other axons [ 28 ] . A PDE axon was considered defective if the axon failed to reach the ventral nerve cord or if it reached the ventral nerve cord at a position greater than a 45° angle from the PDE cell body . Young adult animals were scored , although arx mutants were often scored as L3 or L4 larvae . Percentages of defective PDE axon guidance in each strain were determined , and significance was judged by a two - sided t - test with unequal variance unless other - wise noted . Imaging and analysis of PQR dendrite development The PQR dendrite was visualized using gcy - 32 : : gfp trans - genes [ 29 ] . Larvae were synchronized by washing adults and larvae from a plate with many eggs and allowing the eggs to hatch . Newly hatched larvae were washed from the plate at 0 . 5 h intervals and allowed to develop for the fol - lowing times before imaging : 6 h , 6 . 5 h , 7 h , 7 . 5 h , and 8 h . Animals were imaged using a Leica DMR microscope with a Qimaging Retiga EXi camera . Z - stacks of each PQR were captured and were subject to nearest neighbor deconvolution using Openlab software ( Improvision , Waltham , MA USA ) . Mutations in arx - 2 , arx - 4 , arx - 7 , and erm - 1 Figure 1 Mutations in arx - 2 , arx - 4 , arx - 7 , and erm - 1 . The structures of the arx - 2 , arx - 4 , arx - 7 , and erm - 1 genes are shown . Filled boxes represent exons , arrows represent translational start sites in putative cDNAs , and 5 ' is to the left . The extent of dele - tions in each of the genes is shown below the structure . The arx - 7 ( ok1118 ) deletion extends into the gene to the 3 ' of arx - 7 . Neural Development 2009 , 4 : 38 http : / / www . neuraldevelopment . com / content / 4 / 1 / 38 Page 4 of 20 ( page number not for citation purposes ) Filopodia were defined as growth cone protrusions that were less than 0 . 5 μ m in width . The number of filopodial protrusions from the growth cone of PQR neurons at the 7 to 7 . 5 h timepoint was determined by scrolling through each Z - stack of images . An average number and standard deviation of filopodial protrusions per PQR dendrite was determined , and significance of difference between geno - types was determined by a two - sided t - test with unequal variance unless otherwise noted . The lamellipodial perimeter of the growth cone was used as an indicator of growth cone size . At the 7 to 7 . 5 h time - point , the distal 3 μ m of the tip of the PQR dendritic pro - trusion was traced using ImageJ software , and a value representing the perimeter of this region was derived . An average was derived from multiple tracings , and signifi - cance of difference between genotypes was determined by a two - sided t - test with unequal variance unless otherwise noted . Time lapse imaging of VD growth cones VD growth cones were imaged using an unc - 25 : : gfp trans - gene juIs76 [ 30 ] . Early L2 stage larvae were isolated by washing hatched worms off of a plate and allowing eggs to hatch for one - half hour . Newly hatched larvae were washed off and allowed to develop at 20°C for 16 h . Lar - vae with visible VD growth cones were imaged . Animals were transferred to a 2 % agarose pad with a drop of 10 mM muscimol ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO USA ) in M9 [ 31 ] . The drop was allowed to evaporate for 4 to 5 minutes before a coverslip was placed over the animals . Growth cones that were just emerging from the ventral muscle quadrant were imaged with a Leica DMR microscope with a BD CARV II wide - field light source and QImaging Rolera mGi camera at intervals of 120 s . Total duration of time - lapse imaging ranged from 20 to 60 minutes . Dynamic projections emanating from the growth cone less than 0 . 5 μ m in width were scored as filopodia . Filo - podia length was measured using ImageJ software . Growth cone translocation speed was determined by measuring the distance from the distal tip of the lamel - lipodial portion of the growth cone to a fixed reference point along the axon , often a point at which the axon has crossed a lateral axon tract , which can cause a slight bulge in the axon . Significance of difference was determined by a two - sided t - test with unequal variance . Results Mutations in arx - 2 , arx - 4 , and arx - 7 cause PDE axon guidance defects The Arp2 / 3 complex is composed of seven molecules , Arp2 , Arp3 , and ArpC1 - ArpC5 [ 8 ] . The C . elegans genome contains genes encoding each of these subunits . Deletion mutations in genes encoding three subunits were ana - lyzed ; arx - 2 Arp2 , arx - 4 ArpC2 , and arx - 7 ArpC5 ( Figure 1 ) . arx - 2 ( ok1269 ) was a 1 , 330 - bp deletion that removed part of exon 4 and all of exons 5 and 6 . arx - 4 ( ok1093 ) was a 772 - bp deletion that removed the 3 ' splice site of intron 4 and part of exon 5 . arx - 7 ( ok1118 ) was a 1 , 352 - bp deletion that removed most of exon 3 of arx - 7 ( almost half of the arx - 7 coding region ) and extended into the downstream gene Y54E10BR . 1 , removing exon 1 and most of intron 1 . While arx - 2 ( ok1269 ) and arx - 4 ( ok1093 ) are predicted to affect only arx - 2 and arx - 4 , respectively , arx - 7 ( ok1118 ) might affect both arx - 7 and Y54E10BR . 1 . From mothers heterozygous for each mutation ( wild - type maternal contribution , M + ) , arx - 2 ( ok1269M + ) , arx - 4 ( ok1093M + ) , and arx - 7 ( ok1118M + ) homozygotes grew slowly and arrested as larvae or young adults . Animals that survived to adulthood were sterile and had protrud - ing vulvae ( Pvl phenotype ) . Most arx - 2 ( ok1269M + ) ani - mals arrested before reaching adulthood in the L3 or L4 larval stage . arx - 7 ( ok1118 ) animals arrested in L4 or early adulthood , and arx - 4 ( ok1093 ) animals survived to adult - hood but were sterile and Pvl . RNA interference of arx - 2 and arx - 7 caused embryonic lethality due to defects in gas - trulation as previously described [ 32 ] , indicating that arx - 2 , arx - 7 , and likely arx - 4 have strong maternal contribu - tions that are sufficient for embryonic and larval develop - ment . The variation in arrest phenotype of arx mutants could be due to differences in maternal contribution and not distinct functions of each arx gene . Axon morphology of the PDE neuron was scored in arx homozygous animals . The PDEs are bilateral sensory neu - rons in the posterior of the animal with single , unbranched axons that extend ventrally to the ventral nerve cord ( VNC ) , where the axons bifurcate and extend anteriorly and posteriorly in the VNC ( Figure 2A ) [ 33 ] . In each arx homozygous mutant , defects in axon guidance were observed ( Figure 2B - D ) . arx - 2 ( ok1269M + ) displayed 15 % PDE axon guidance defects , arx - 4 ( ok1093M + ) 34 % , and arx - 7 ( ok1118M + ) 30 % ( Figure 2E ) . Defects included failure of the axon to extend straight ventrally with lateral wandering , often never reaching the VNC ( Figure 2B ) . Mutant PDE axons sometimes bifurcated prematurely before reaching the VNC ( Figure 2C ) . Furthermore , some axons appeared to initiate from the sides of the PDE cell body rather than the ventral surface ( Figure 2D ) . This could reflect a defect in polarity of axon initiation or could be a consequence of growth cone misguidance . arx mutants did not display a high frequency of ectopic axon formation as do other mutations that also affect PDE axon guidance ( for example , mig - 2 , ced - 10 and unc - 115 ) . To ensure that the phenotype observed in arx mutants was due to disruption of the arx gene , the entire wild - type genomic region for each locus was amplified by PCR and Neural Development 2009 , 4 : 38 http : / / www . neuraldevelopment . com / content / 4 / 1 / 38 Page 5 of 20 ( page number not for citation purposes ) Figure 2 ( see legend on next page ) Neural Development 2009 , 4 : 38 http : / / www . neuraldevelopment . com / content / 4 / 1 / 38 Page 6 of 20 ( page number not for citation purposes ) used in transgenic rescue experiments ( see Materials and methods ) . arx - 4 is the downstream gene in a C . elegans operon , and the entire operon region composed of the genes K02F3 . 1 , K02F3 . 12 , and Y6D11A . 1 was included in the fragment . The arx - 2 ( + ) and arx - 4 ( + ) transgenes res - cued the slow growth , sterility and pVul phenotype of arx - 2 ( ok1269 ) and arx - 4 ( ok1093 ) , respectively , and transgenic animals were viable and fertile . Furthermore , PDE axon defects were completely rescued ( Figure 2E ; 15 % to 3 % for arx - 2 ( ok1269M + ) and 34 % to 1 % for arx - 4 ( ok1093 ) ; P < 0 . 0001 for each ) . The arx - 7 ( + ) fragment rescued the slow growth and pVul components of the arx - 7 ( ok1118 ) phenotype as well as PDE axon pathfinding defects ( 30 % to 3 % ; P < 0 . 0001 ; Figure 2E ) . However , arx - 7 ( ok1118 ) ; Ex [ arx - 7 ( + ) ] animals were still sterile . The arx - 7 ( ok1118 ) deletion also affected the downstream gene Y54E10BR . 1 , which was not included in the rescuing fragment . The ste - rility of arx - 7 ( ok118 ) ; Ex [ arx - 7 ( + ) ] transgenic animals might be due to the effects of ok1118 on Y54E10BR . 1 . These data indicate that the PDE axon guidance defects observed in arx mutants are due to mutation of the arx genes . arx - 4 acts cell - autonomously in PDE axon guidance To determine if arx - 4 acts in neurons to control axon path - finding , a transgene was constructed consisting of the osm - 6 promoter upstream of the arx - 4 coding region . The osm - 6 promoter is active exclusively in ciliated sensory neu - rons including PDE and has no apparent activity in other tissues [ 15 , 28 ] . arx - 4 ( ok1093M + ) animals harboring the Posm - 6 : : arx - 4 ( + ) transgene were slow - growing , Pvl , and sterile , similar to arx - 4 ( ok1093 ) homozygotes alone , con - firming that the Posm - 6 : : arx - 4 ( + ) transgene was not broadly active . However , PDE axon guidance defects were rescued in these animals ( 34 % to 2 % ; P < 0 . 0001 ; Figure 2E ) , suggesting that expression of arx - 4 in the PDE neu - rons rescued arx - 4 axon guidance defects . These results suggest that arx - 4 acts cell - autonomously in the PDE neu - rons in axon guidance . arx mutations enhance mutations in ced - 10 / Rac , mig - 2 / RhoG Previous results indicated that the Rac - like molecules CED - 10 / Rac [ 26 ] and MIG - 2 / RhoG [ 27 ] act redundantly in axon guidance [ 34 ] and that the Arp2 / 3 activators WVE - 1 / WAVE and WSP - 1 / WASP might act in the CED - 10 / Rac and MIG - 2 / RhoG pathways , respectively [ 10 ] . The loss - of - function alleles ced - 10 ( n1993 ) and mig - 2 ( mu28 ) enhanced the PDE axon pathfinding defects of arx - 2 ( ok1269M + ) , arx - 4 ( ok1093M + ) , and arx - 7 ( ok1118M + ) ( Figure 2F ) . For example , ced - 10 ( n1993 ) ; arx - 4 ( ok1093M + ) displayed 77 % PDE axon guidance defects compared to 34 % for arx - 4 ( ok1093M + ) alone ; and mig - 2 ( mu28 ) ; arx - 7 ( ok1118M + ) displayed 68 % compared to 30 % for arx - 7 ( ok1118M + ) alone ( P < 0 . 0001 for all com - parisons ) . Double mutants did not exhibit ectopic axon formation as observed in ced - 10 ; mig - 2 double mutants [ 34 ] . That each arx mutation was enhanced by both ced - 10 ( n1993 ) and mig - 2 ( mu28 ) suggests that the Arp2 / 3 complex might act in both the CED - 10 Rac and MIG - 2 RhoG pathways in PDE axon guidance . Possibly , both WVE - 1 / WAVE and WSP - 1 / WASP pathways converge on regulation of Arp2 / 3 in axon guidance . The actin - binding proteins UNC - 115 / abLIM and UNC - 34 / Enabled have redundant function with Arp2 / 3 in axon guidance Previous studies showed that the actin - binding protein UNC - 115 / abLIM acts downstream of Rac signaling in axon guidance [ 15 ] , raising the possibility that Rac signal - ing employs multiple actin - modulating pathways in axon guidance ( UNC - 115 / abLIM and Arp2 / 3 ) . Indeed , unc - 115 mutations enhanced PDE guidance defects of arx mutants ( Figure 2G ) . For example , unc - 115 ( ky275 ) ; arx - 2 ( ok1269M + ) displayed 83 % PDE axon guidance defects compared to 15 % for arx - 2 ( ok1269M + ) alone ( P < 0 . 0001 for all differences ) . Double mutants did not display enhanced ectopic axon formation as observed in double mutants of unc - 115 with ced - 10 and mig - 2 . That unc - 115 mutations enhanced PDE axon guidance defects of arx mutations indicates that UNC - 115 / abLIM acts in parallel PDE axon pathfinding defects in arx mutants Figure 2 ( see previous page ) PDE axon pathfinding defects in arx mutants . ( A - D ) Shown are fluorescent micrographs of larval or young adult animals with osm - 6 : : gfp expression in the PDE neurons . ( A ) A wild - type PDE neuron extended a single unbranched axon ( arrow ) straight ventrally to the ventral nerve cord ( VNC ) , which is out of focus but represented by a dashed line . ( B - D ) PDE axons were misguided in arx - 2 , arx - 4 , and arx - 7 mutants . The axons failed to reach the VNC and wandered laterally ( B , C ) or wan - dered laterally before extending to the VNC ( D ) . In all micrographs , anterior is to the left and dorsal is up ; dashed lines repre - sent the location of the out - of - focus VNC , and scale bars = 10 μ m . In genotypes , ' M + ' denotes that the animal had wild - type maternal arx contribution . ( E - G ) Quantification of PDE axon guidance defects . Genotypes are along the x - axis , and proportion of misguided PDE axons is on the y - axis . The numbers of PDE axons scored for each genotype is listed above the graph . In ( E ) , Ex [ arx ( + ) ] indicates that the animals harbored a wild - type arx ( + ) transgene , and Ex [ Posm - 6 : : arx - 4 ] indicates that the animals harbored a transgene that expressed the arx - 4 ( + ) gene specifically in the PDEs . The differences between arx mutants alone and those harboring transgenes were significant in all cases ( P ≤ 0 . 0001 , indicated by an asterisk ) . Neural Development 2009 , 4 : 38 http : / / www . neuraldevelopment . com / content / 4 / 1 / 38 Page 7 of 20 ( page number not for citation purposes ) to Arp2 / 3 in PDE axon guidance , a result consistent with the idea that Rac GTPases employ both Arp2 / 3 and UNC - 115 / abLIM . Previous studies showed that UNC - 115 / abLIM and UNC - 34 / Enabled had redundant roles in PDE axon guidance [ 16 ] . As predicted by this result , UNC - 34 / Enabled and Arp2 / 3 also had parallel function in PDE axon guidance ( Figure 2G ) . Alone , loss - of - function unc - 34 ( e951 ) mutants displayed 8 % PDE guidance defects . unc - 34 ( e951 ) ; arx - 4 ( ok1093 ) and unc - 34 ( e951 ) ; arx - 7 ( ok1118M + ) displayed 91 % and 97 % PDE guidance defects compared to 35 % and 35 % for the arx mutants alone ( P < 0 . 0001 for each comparison ) . Together , these data indicate that Arp2 / 3 , UNC - 115 / abLIM , and UNC - 34 / Enabled all act redundantly to control PDE axon guid - ance . Ezrin / radixin / moesin ( ERM ) proteins are regulators of actin organization and interaction with the plasma mem - brane . The C . elegans genome encodes one molecule sim - ilar to ezrin , radixin , and moesin called ERM - 1 . erm - 1 ( tm677 ) is an out - of - frame deletion of the locus ( Figure 1 ) that causes maternal - effect lethality ( that is , homozy - gotes from a heterozygous mother survive until adult - hood ) . RNA interference of erm - 1 results in disrupted morphogenesis of the gut lumen [ 35 , 36 ] . We found that erm - 1 ( tm677M + ) animals displayed weak but significant defects in PDE axon guidance ( 9 % ; Figure 3 ) . Double mutants of erm - 1 ( tm677M + ) with unc - 115 ( ky275 ) and unc - 34 ( e951 ) displayed PDE axon guidance defects that were not significantly different from the singles alone . These results indicate that ERM - 1 has a role in PDE axon guidance but does not act redundantly with UNC - 115 and UNC - 34 . Thus , the synergistic enhancement of arx mutants by unc - 34 and unc - 115 is not likely due to general actin cytoskeletal disruption . Rather , these results suggest that the genetic interaction is specific and that Arp2 / 3 , UNC - 115 , and UNC - 34 might act in a common process in axon guidance not affected by ERM - 1 . Development of the posterior PQR neurite involves a growth - cone - like structure with filopodia Mutations in arx genes caused axon guidance defects , but the effect of arx mutations on the growth cone during neu - rite extension was unclear . Developing neurites in arx mutants were analyzed . Transgenes used to assay PDE axon morphology were not visibly expressed early in PDE development during axon extension , including osm - 6 : : gfp [ 28 ] and cat - 1 : : gfp [ 37 ] . Therefore , the development of a distinct neurite was examined . A gcy - 32 : : gfp reporter [ 29 ] was used to analyze outgrowth of the posterior PQR neu - rite , which develops into a ciliated sensory dendrite [ 33 ] . The PQR neuron , a descendant of the QL neuroblast , is born in the posterior of the L1 larva and migrates to its final position in the tail near the phasmid ganglia [ 38 ] . At 6 . 5 h after hatching , the PQR cell body had reached its final position and differentiation began . At this time , gcy - 32 : : gfp expression was evident , revealing a large , wedge - shaped cell body with multiple finger - like filopodial pro - trusions emanating from around the cell body ( Figure 4A ) .

From 7 to 7 . 5 h , posterior extensions thinned into neurite - like structures with distal growth cones and multiple filopodial protrusions ( Figure 4C ) . Filopodia also protruded along the lengths of the neurites . Also at this time , the cell bodies of the PQR neurons began to resemble a typical neuronal cell body : they became smaller in size and oval - shaped with fewer filopodial extensions . From 7 . 5 to 8 h , the neurites were thin and the growth cones at their tips continued to extend ( Figure 5D ) . Filopodial extensions became mostly restricted to the distal growth cone at this time . By 8 . 5 h , the neurites had extended completely and the growth cone - like struc - tures were no longer evident . In broad terms , PQR den - dritic extension involved initial dorsal - posterior protrusion , consolidation of the protrusion into a neurite with a growth cone , and growth cone extension .

The finger - like extensions on PQR growth cones resem - bled filopodia .

To con - firm that the finger - like protrusions that emanated from the PQR dendrite were filopodia , we determined if they were affected by mutation in unc - 34 / Enabled .

These larvae exhibited a general growth delay , and timing of PQR dendritic events were slowed by approximately one - half hour . At 7 h , initial wedge - like cell shape with filopodia appeared normal in arx - 2 and arx - 7 mutants ( Figure 4E ) . From 7 to 7 . 5 hours , arx - 2 and arx - 7 extended dorsal - posterior foot - like structures . How - ever , these protrusions displayed fewer filopodial exten - sions than wild type ( Figure 4F ) . Neurite consolidation appeared normal in arx - 2 and arx - 7 , but from 7 . 5 to 8 . 5 hours , the growth cones at the distal tip displayed fewer filopodia ( Figure 4G , H ) . Furthermore , fewer filopodia were evident along the length of the neurites . The poste - rior protrusions and growth cones of arx - 2 and arx - 7 mutants often appeared thinner and less ramified than in wild type , possibly indicating a growth cone lamellipodial defect as well ( see Figure 5 for additional representative images of wild - type and arx - 7 ( ok1118M + ) growth cones ) . The number of filopodia on the growth cones and neur - ites of wild type ( 7 - 8 h ) , arx - 2 ( ok1269M + ) , and arx - 7 ( ok1118M + ) ( 7 . 5 - 8 . 5 h ) were counted ( Figure 6A ; see Materials and methods ) . Wild type displayed an average of 4 . 89 filopodia per neurite whereas arx - 2 ( ok1269M + ) displayed 2 . 27 and arx - 7 ( ok1118M + ) 1 . 78 ( P < 0 . 0001 for each ; Figure 6B ) . As mentioned previously , the growth cones of arx mutants often appeared less robust and smaller in size than wild type . To quantify this defect , the perimeters of growth cones ( excluding filopodia ) from wild type and mutant backgrounds were traced ( Figure 6A ; see Materials and methods ) . The growth cone was defined as the widened region at the tip of the neurite , starting at 3 μ m from the distal growth cone tip . Wild - type growth cones displayed an average perimeter of 7 . 96 ± 0 . 91 μ m ( Figure 6C ) . arx - 7 displayed a significantly reduced average growth perime - ter ( 6 . 77 ± 0 . 51 μ m ; P < 0 . 001 ) . To determine if these growth cone defects resulted in neu - rite guidance defects , we scored the final morphology of the PQR dendrites after outgrowth . Initial posterior pro - trusion , axon consolidation , and outgrowth of the neurite to its normal position in the tail were generally normal in arx mutants . However , PQR dendrites did not extend directly to the posterior as in wild type ( Figure 7A ) . Rather , the dendrites displayed multiple turns , resulting in an undulating dendrite appearance ( Figure 7B , C ; 45 % in arx - 7 compared to 19 % in wild type ) . These data indi - cate that arx - 7 ( ok1118M + ) affects the guidance of the PQR dendrite . arx - 7 acts cell - autonomously in PQR filopodia regulation A transgene consisting of the gcy - 32 promoter driving arx - 7 tagged with coding region for GFP was constructed . This transgene was predicted to express full - length ARX - 7 with GFP at the carboxyl terminus . Animals harboring this transgene showed ARX - 7 : : GFP fluorescence in the URX , AQR , and PQR neurons and nowhere else ( data not shown ) . arx - 7 ( ok1118M + ) animals harboring this trans - gene displayed the gross phenotype of arx - 7 ( ok1118M + ) alone ( arrested larvae and sterile , Pvl adults ) , indicating that arx - 7 ( + ) activity was not widely provided by the Pgcy - 32 : : arx - 7 : : gfp transgene . However , this transgene rescued filopodia formation to wild - type levels in arx - 7 ( ok1118M + ) PQR neurites ( Figure 6B ) : an average of 5 . 1 filopodia per neurite compared to 1 . 78 for arx - 7 ( ok1118M + ) alone ( P < 0 . 0001 ) . arx - 7 rescue was not sig - nificantly different than wild type ( 5 . 1 versus 4 . 89 ; P = 0 . 71 ) . These data indicate that arx - 7 acts cell - autono - mously in the regulation of growth cone filopodia . unc - 115 / abLIM mutation enhanced PQR filopodia defects of arx - 2 and arx - 7 As reported above , unc - 115 mutations enhanced PDE axon guidance defects of arx - 2 , arx - 4 , and arx - 7 , indicating redundancy of function in PDE axon guidance . The effect of unc - 115 on PQR posterior neurite extension was exam - ined . Alone , unc - 115 ( ky275 ) , a null allele , displayed no defects in PQR posterior neurite filopodia formation ( for example , 4 . 61 filopodia versus 4 . 89 for wild type , P = 0 . 51 ; Figure 6B ) . However , unc - 115 ( ky275 ) enhanced filo - podia defects of arx - 2 ( ok1269M + ) and arx - 7 ( ok1118M + ) . unc - 115 ( ky275 ) ; arx - 2 ( ok1269M + ) displayed 1 . 22 filopo - dia per neurite compared to 2 . 27 for arx - 2 ( ok1269M + ) alone ( P = 0 . 003 ) , and unc - 115 ( ky275 ) ; arx - 7 ( ok1118M + ) displayed 1 . 04 compared to 1 . 78 for arx - 7 ( ok1118M + ) alone ( P = 0 . 007 ) . unc - 115 ( ky275 ) mutants also displayed a reduced growth cone perimeter ( Figure 6C ; 6 . 52 ± 0 . 57 μ m compared to 7 . 96 ± 0 . 91 μ m for wild type ; P < 0 . 001 ) , indicating that UNC - 115 might be involved in growth cone lamellipo - dium regulation . unc - 115 ( ky275 ) displayed 41 % PQR dendrite guidance defects ( the undulating dendrite ) , com - pared to 19 % for wild type ( Figure 7C ) . Alone , unc - 115 ( ky275 ) had no affect on filopodia , suggesting that unc - 115 PQR dendrite guidance defects were due to affects on lamellipodia and not filopodia . unc - 115 ; arx double mutants displayed a defect not seen in unc - 115 , arx - 2 , or arx - 7 single mutants , a rudimentary or absent posterior PQR neurite ( Figure 4J , K ) : 12 of 70 PQR neurons from unc - 115 ( ky275 ) ; arx - 2 ( ok1269M + ) and 9 of 75 unc - 115 ( ky275 ) ; arx - 7 ( ok1118M + ) animals lacked a significant posterior protrusion . Some animals showed a rudimentary posterior protrusion ( Figure 4J ) Neural Development 2009 , 4 : 38 http : / / www . neuraldevelopment . com / content / 4 / 1 / 38 Page 12 of 20 ( page number not for citation purposes ) whereas other showed no posterior neurite ( Figure 4K ) . These observations suggest that in addition to being required for filopodia formation , the Arp2 / 3 complex and UNC - 115 / abLIM might also redundantly control neurite initiation or the ability of a neurite to form and extend . unc - 34 / Enabled affects filopodia but not growth cone perimeter As previously observed in the HSN neuron [ 40 ] , unc - 34 ( e951 ) mutants displayed severely reduced filopodia - like protrusions on the PQR dendritic neurite ( Figures 4I and 6 ; 1 . 48 , P < 0 . 0001 ) . That unc - 34 affected these thin , filopodia - like protrusions supports the notion that they are bona fide filopodia , as Enabled molecules have been shown to control filopodia formation in many systems , including C . elegans neurons [ 40 , 41 ] . arx - 7 ( ok1118M + ) ; unc - 34 ( e951 ) displayed significantly fewer filopodia than each single alone , but an additive effect of the two muta - tions combined could not be excluded ( Figure 6B ) . Some arx - 7 ( ok1118M + ) ; unc - 34 ( e951 ) double mutants lacked a strong posterior neurite from PQR ( 2 of 17 ) , similar to arx ; unc - 115 double mutants , suggesting that UNC - 34 / Enabled and the Arp2 / 3 complex might control the ability of a neurite to form or to extend . unc - 34 mutants did not display a reduction in PQR growth cone perimeter ( 7 . 78 ± 0 . 9 μ m compared to 7 . 96 ± 0 . 91 μ m for wild type ; P = 0 . 387 ; Figure 6C ) . These data indicate that Arp2 / 3 and UNC - 115 affect both growth cone filopodia and growth cone perimeter , which might reflect lamellipodial protrusion . In contrast , unc - 34 affected only growth cone filopodia but not growth cone perimeter . Thus , growth cone perimeter and number of filopodia are at least partially independent processes . For example , unc - 115 alone affected growth cone perimeter but not filopodia , and unc - 34 affected filopodia but not growth cone size . These results indicate that the filopodial defects seen in arx mutants might be a specific defect in filopodia and are unlikely to simply be a secondary effect of reduced lamellipodial protrusion . ARX - 7 , UNC - 115 / abLIM , and UNC - 34 affect filopodia initiation but not duration or length The effects of Arp2 / 3 , UNC - 115 , and UNC - 34 on PQR growth cone filopodia formation could be due to decreased filopodial stability or half - life , or could be due to a decrease in the rate of filopodial initiation . We imaged growth cones from wild type and mutants over time to assess the dynamic effects of these mutations of filopodia formation .

The VD axons begin extension dur - ing the L1 / L2 larval molt and continue to extend early in the second larval stage . As the VD commissural growth cones emerge dorsally after traversing the ventral muscle quadrant , they display a spread appearance with multiple dynamic filopodial extensions [ 42 ] . Until the growth cones reach the dorsal muscle quadrant , they generally retain a spread morphology with multiple filopodial extensions ( [ 42 ] and our observations ) . To understand the roles of Arp2 / 3 and UNC - 115 in filo - podia formation , we imaged VD growth cones as they migrated between the ventral and dorsal muscle quad - rants . In wild type , the VD growth cones displayed dynamic extension and retraction of lamellipodia - like and filopodia - like projections ( Figure 8A ; Additional file 1 ) . In arx - 7 , unc - 115 and unc - 34 mutants , VD growth cone dynamics appeared generally reduced , and the growth cones displayed a less ramified appearance ( Figure 8B - D ; Additional files 2 , 3 and 4 ) . Notably , fewer filopodia were observed on the growth cones of mutants , consistent with results in PQR . Reduced steady - state filopodia number could be due to a defect in filopodia initiation or filopodia stability or dura - tion . We tracked the emergence and dynamics of multiple individual filopodial from multiple growth cones over time ( Figure 9A ) . This analysis revealed that filopodia had an initiation rate of 0 . 26 filopodia per minute in wild type ( approximately one new filopodium initiated every 4 minutes ; Figure 9B ) . Filopodia initiation rate was signifi - cantly reduced in arx - 7 , unc - 115 , and unc - 34 mutants ( Fig - ure 9B ) : 0 . 16 per minute , 0 . 17 per minute , and 0 . 07 per minute , respectively . Filopodia did occasionally form in these mutants , and we measured their duration time and Time lapse images of VD growth cone outgrowth Figure 8 Time lapse images of VD growth cone outgrowth .

We found no significant difference between wild type and any of these mutants in filopodial duration ( 4 to 5 . 5 minutes ; Figure 9C ) or maximal filopo - dial length ( 0 . 8 to 1 μ m ; Figure 9D ) . These data indicate that arx - 7 , unc - 115 , and unc - 34 primarily affected the rate of filopodia initiation but did not affect the duration or maximal length of filopodia once they had formed . How - ever , we cannot rule out the possibility that some filopo - dia initiate but abort before they are detectable in our assay . We also determined the average translocation rates of wild - type and mutant growth cones ( see Materials and methods ; Table 1 ) . Wild type had a translocation rate of 7 . 38 μ m / h . This rate is consistent with what has been observed previously for VD growth cones in mounted and anaesthetized larvae ( 4 to 8 . 7 μ m / h ) [ 42 ] . arx - 7 and unc - 34 had significantly reduced growth cone translocation rates : 4 . 08 μ m / h for arx - 7 and 3 . 84 μ m / h for unc - 34 ( Table 1 ) . unc - 115 did not have a significantly reduced translocation rate ( 7 . 02 μ m / h ) . Variability in transloca - tion rate in each genotype , including wild type , was very high , making it difficult to assign a direct effect on growth cone morphology to translocation rate . For example , unc - 115 affected filopodia to the same extent as arx - 7 but did not affect translocation rate . It is possible , however , that these mutants have distinct effects on growth cones aside from filopodia that were not assayed in these studies . unc - 115 and unc - 34 have been shown previously to have VD / DD axon guidance defects [ 14 , 16 , 18 ] . arx - 7 mutants also displayed VD / DD pathfinding defects ( compare Fig - ure 10A and 10B ) . In arx - 7 , VD and DD axons wandered laterally and crossed other commissural axons in 77 % ( n = 40 ) of animals ( Figure 10C ) . All arx - 7 VD / DD axons reached the dorsal nerve cord . Such crossings were occa - sionally observed in wild type ( 38 % , n = 100 ) , but occurred at a significantly higher rate in arx - 7 ( P < 0 . 0001 ) . While the penetrance of axon guidance defects of arx - 7 , unc - 115 , and unc - 34 were similar ( Figure 10C ) , the misguided axons in arx - 7 always reached the dorsal cord , whereas misguided unc - 115 and unc - 34 axons wandered laterally , terminated prematurely , and sometimes failed to reach the dorsal nerve cord [ 14 , 16 ] . The filopodia defects of arx - 7 were as severe as those of unc - 34 and unc - 115 , suggesting that unc - 115 and unc - 34 might have other , non - filopodial roles in axon guidance not shared by arx - 7 . Discussion The Arp2 / 3 complex controls growth cone size and filopodia formation in vivo The results presented here show that the Arp2 / 3 complex is required for the initiation of growth cone filopodia of C . elegans neurons in vivo . The role of Arp2 / 3 in growth cone morphology has been controversial , based on stud - ies in cultured neurons . Some studies concluded that Arp2 / 3 was not involved in growth cone filopodia forma - tion [ 11 , 12 ] , while another demonstrated a role for Arp2 / 3 in growth cone filopodia formation [ 13 ] . Our results presented here clearly demonstrate that Arp2 / 3 is required for growth cone filopodia formation in vivo . The previous study that found no role of Arp2 / 3 in cultured hippocam - pal growth cone filopodia formation used expression of a dominant negative WAVE construct to inhibit Arp2 / 3 [ 11 ] , whereas the study that found an effect of Arp2 / 3 in hippocampal growth cones used small interfering RNA knockdown of the p34 - Arc subunit of the Arp2 / 3 complex [ 13 ] . Possibly , the dominant - negative WAVE construct did not inhibit Arp2 / 3 as well as the small interfering RNA . In any case , our studies of C . elegans growth cones in vivo demonstrate that Arp2 / 3 is a key regulator of growth cone filopodia formation . A previous study using cultured hippocampal neurons [ 13 ] showed that Arp2 / 3 was present in the growth cone at branch points of actin filaments as observed in other cell types , and filaments with Arp2 / 3 at their base contrib - uted to filopodial bundles , suggesting that Arp2 / 3 pro - vides a source of actin filaments for filopodial formation [ 13 ] . The nature of the growth cone cytoskeletal defects in arx mutant growth cones is difficult to discern , as the growth cones are very small compared to those of cultured hippocampal neurons ( < 5 μ m in diameter compared to approximately 20 μ m for cultured hippocampal neu - rons ) . However , it is possible that there is reduced nucle - ation of lamellipodial actin filaments in arx - 7 mutant growth cones , resulting in less availability of lamellipo - dial actin filaments to contribute to filopodial bundles . This idea is consistent with the time - lapse analysis of growth cone filopodia , which showed that arx mutants had reduced filopodial initiation rates compared to wild type ( Figure 9 ) . arx - 7 mutant PQR growth cones also dis - played a reduction in the size of the growth cone ( Figures 5 and 6 ) , consistent with a role of Arp2 / 3 in the nuclea - tion of growth cone lamellipodial actin filaments . Inter - estingly , once filopodia formed in arx - 7 mutants , they had characteristics similar to wild type , including time of per - sistence / stability and maximal length . Thus , the Arp2 / 3 complex might primarily affect the initiation of filopodia and have only a minor role in filopodial stability or exten - sion once a filopodium has initiated . However , we cannot rule out the possibility that filopodia initiate and collapse before they are visible as filopodia in our imaging assays . The Arp2 / 3 complex is required for axon guidance As a growth cone navigates its environment , filopodia are thought to act as sensors of extracellular cues and have a role in guiding the growth cone [ 43 , 44 ] . Consistent with this idea , we found that arx mutants have defects in the guidance of the PDE and VD / DD axons and of the PQR Neural Development 2009 , 4 : 38 http : / / www . neuraldevelopment . com / content / 4 / 1 / 38 Page 15 of 20 ( page number not for citation purposes ) Quantification of VD / DD growth cone dynamics Figure 9 Quantification of VD / DD growth cone dynamics .

Reduction of filopodia on arx mutant growth cones might lead to growth cone guidance defects . How - ever , arx axon guidance defects were incompletely pene - trant ( for example , 15 to 34 % for the PDEs ) . This could be due to the action of the remaining few filopodia on arx mutant growth cones or could be due to lamellipodial guidance . Indeed , unc - 34 / Enabled mutants lack most or all growth cone filopodia but have relatively weak effects on axon guidance ( [ 16 , 18 , 40 ] and this work ) . Rac GTPases are thought to regulate Arp2 / 3 activity via the WAVE family of Arp2 / 3 activators : WAVE is present in a complex with Sra - 1 and kette , and Rac - GTP binding to Sra - 1 activates WAVE and thus Arp2 / 3 [ 45 , 46 ] . Previous studies showed that in C . elegans PDE axon guidance , CED - 10 Rac acts with WVE - 1 / WAVE , and that MIG - 2 / RhoG acts with the WSP - 1 / WASP molecule , a member of the WASP family of Arp2 / 3 activators [ 10 ] . Shown here is that PDE axon guidance defects of arx mutations were enhanced by both ced - 10 and mig - 2 , consistent with a role of both CED - 10 / Rac and MIG - 2 / RhoG in the Arp2 / 3 pathway ( Figure 11 ) . CED - 10 / Rac might also control UNC - 115 / abLIM [ 15 ] , explaining the enhancement of arx mutations by ced - 10 . UNC - 115 / abLIM controls growth cone size and filopodia formation As mentioned above , the weak axon guidance defects of arx mutants could be explained by the lamellipodial guid - ance or by the activity of the remaining few filopodia on mutant growth cones , presumably formed by Arp2 / 3 - independent mechanisms .

We found that UNC - 115 / abLIM also affected the formation of growth cone filopodia . While unc - 115 dis - played no significant reduction of filopodia on PQR growth cones , it did enhance filopodia defects of arx - 7 . Furthermore , unc - 115 displayed reduced filopodia initia - tion rate on VD / DD growth cones . These data indicate that UNC - 115 / abLIM is also a regulator of filopodia initi - ation similar to Arp2 / 3 . That unc - 115 / abLIM mutants alone have defects in VD filopodia but not PQR filopodia suggests that different neurons have distinct requirements for UNC - 115 / abLIM in growth cone filopodia formation . This could be due to different guidance signals detected by these neurons that trigger distinct downstream signal transduction pathways , resulting in different require - ments for UNC - 115 / abLIM . UNC - 115 / abLIM binds to actin filaments via the carboxy - terminal villin headpiece domain ( VHD ) , and promotes the formation of lamellipodia and filopodia in C . elegans neurons and cultured fibroblasts [ 15 , 23 ] . UNC - 115 / abLIM might act as a bundling protein in filopodial bun - dles , or it might produce new actin filaments for use in filopodia , similar to Arp2 / 3 . Indeed , the villin headpiece domain from human villin can nucleate actin polymeriza - tion [ 47 ] , but this activity has not been described for UNC - 115 / abLIM . Our results here suggest that UNC - 115 / abLIM might also have a role in lamellipodia organiza - tion similar to Arp2 / 3 , as unc - 115 mutants also displayed reduced PQR growth cone size . UNC - 34 / Enabled affects filopodia formation without affecting growth cone morphology Enabled has been extensively implicated in filopodia for - mation , including on growth cones , and our results that unc - 34 mutant growth cones had reduced filopodia num - bers confirm this role of Enabled . In time - lapse studies , we found that unc - 34 affected the rate of filopodia forma - tion , suggesting that Enabled controls filopodia initiation similar to Arp2 / 3 and UNC - 115 / abLIM . This is similar to previous results in cultured neurons in response to netrin [ 19 ] . We found that unc - 34 had no effect on filopodia sta - bility or length once a rare filopodium formed , indicating that UNC - 34 has no role in filopodia outgrowth or stabil - ity . This is in contrast to cultured neurons , where Ena / VASP inhibition also resulted in filopodia extension defects [ 19 ] . In contrast to arx - 7 and unc - 115 mutants , unc - 34 mutant PQR growth cones , while nearly devoid of filopodia , dis - A model of Arp2 / 3 , UNC - 115 / abLIM , and UNC - 34 in growth cone filopodia formation Figure 11 A model of Arp2 / 3 , UNC - 115 / abLIM , and UNC - 34 in growth cone filopodia formation . Arp2 / 3 might act down - stream of both CED - 10 / Rac and MIG - 2 / RhoG and in parallel to UNC - 115 / abLIM and UNC - 34 / Enabled . CED - 10 / Rac might also regulate UNC - 115 / abLIM . Neural Development 2009 , 4 : 38 http : / / www . neuraldevelopment . com / content / 4 / 1 / 38 Page 18 of 20 ( page number not for citation purposes ) played no significant reduction in size . While all three mutations caused reduced filopodia initiation , this differ - ence might hint at distinct mechanisms of action of these molecules . Possibly , Arp2 / 3 and UNC - 115 / abLIM prima - rily affect lamellipodial actin organization such that fila - ments are less available for filopodia formation in mutants . In contrast , UNC - 34 / Enabled had a filopodia - specific effect , consistent with the role of Ena / VASP mole - cules as actin anti - capping proteins . It is surprising that unc - 34 had little or no effect on stability or length of the few filopodia that did form in these mutants . Possibly , the anti - capping activity of UNC - 34 / Enabled is required only during initiation and other proteins can serve its function during elongation . It is also possible that filopodial initi - ation requires other actin - interacting properties of Ena - bled that have been described recently ( for example , filament nucleation or bundling ) [ 21 , 22 ] . Arp2 / 3 , UNC - 115 / abLIM , and UNC - 34 / Enabled act together in axon guidance Our results indicate that Arp2 / 3 , UNC - 115 / abLIM , and UNC - 34 / Enabled are required for growth cone filopodia formation . However , the effects of these mutations on PDE and VD / DD axon guidance and PQR dendritic guid - ance were incompletely penetrant . Strikingly , double mutants of arx with unc - 115 and unc - 34 displayed greatly enhanced PDE axon guidance defects , and previous stud - ies showed that unc - 34 and unc - 115 had overlapping roles in PDE axon guidance . Possibly , perturbing multiple actin modulating molecules had general , nonspecific effects on the cytoskeleton , resulting in increased defects . We think this is not the case as these interactions were specific . erm - 1 encodes the only member of the ezrin / radixin / moesin family of actin - membrane linking proteins in the C . ele - gans genome . erm - 1 mutation caused weak guidance defects on its own , indicating that ERM - 1 is required for axon guidance . However , erm - 1 did not enhance unc - 115 or unc - 34 , suggesting that the enhancement of arx , unc - 115 , and unc - 34 is specific to these genes and is not the result of general cytoskeletal disruption . Together , our data indicate that Arp2 / 3 , UNC - 115 / abLIM , and UNC34 / Enabled might act in a common process in axon guidance , namely in the initiation of growth cone filopodia ( Figure 11 ) . Indeed , unc - 115 and unc - 34 enhanced the PQR filopodia defects of arx - 7 , although the enhancement by unc - 34 might simply be an additive effect because unc - 34 mutants alone display severely reduced filopodia numbers . It is also possible that all three mole - cules affect filopodia formation and have redundant roles in other aspects of growth cone morphology . Indeed , this seems to be the case , as both unc - 115 ; arx and unc - 34 ; arx double mutants displayed severe PQR neurite outgrowth and formation defects . This is surprising for unc - 34 / Ena - bled , as Ena / VASP molecules were traditionally considered to be anti - capping proteins with specific effects on filopo - dia . However , recent studies have suggested that Ena / VASP molecules have other effects on actin , including bundling and nucleation [ 21 ] , have anti - capping - inde - pendent roles in filopodia formation [ 22 ] and control the initiation of neurites in the mammalian central nervous system [ 48 , 49 ] . Possibly these other roles of UNC - 34 / Enabled explain the severe defects in neurite formation in unc - 34 ; arx double mutants . Conclusion Many molecules have been implicated in axon guidance through genetic , molecular , and biochemical studies . The effects of these molecules on the behavior and dynamics of the growth cone during axon guidance are unclear in many cases . Through a combination of genetic analysis and time - lapse imaging of growth cones during out - growth , we show that the Arp2 / 3 complex acts cell auton - omously in the initiation of new growth cone filopodia during growth cone outgrowth , possibly explaining the axon guidance defects observed in arx mutants . We show that two other actin modulatory molecules , UNC - 115 / abLIM and UNC - 34 / Enabled , also affect growth cone filo - podia initiation , which might explain the genetic redun - dancy of Arp2 / 3 , UNC - 115 / abLIM , and UNC - 34 / Enabled in axon guidance . Arp2 / 3 and UNC - 115 / abLIM , but not UNC - 34 / Enabled , also affect the size of the growth cone , possibly reflecting a role in the formation of growth cone lamellipodium . Thus , multiple actin regulatory molecules have shared roles ( filopodia initiation ) and distinct roles ( lamellipodia formation ) in the growth cone during axon outgrowth .
