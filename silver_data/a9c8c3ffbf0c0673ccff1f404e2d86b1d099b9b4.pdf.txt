Ka Materials as different as granular matter , colloidal sus - pensions , or lithospheric block systems share the common property that they may exist in a highly fragile state [ 1 , 2 ] . While , in principle , able to withstand static shear stresses , small changes in the loading conditions may lead to large scale structural rearrangements or even to the complete ﬂuidization of the material [ 2 – 4 ] . To understand the ex - traordinary mechanical properties of these systems , new concepts have to be developed that go beyond the applica - tion of classical elasticity theory and that sufﬁciently re - ﬂect the presence of the microstructure [ 5 ] . One example is the ‘‘stress - only’’ approach to the elasticity of granular materials [ 6 ] , where the elimination of the kinematic de - grees of freedom accounts for the inﬁnite stiffness of the grains . This seems to capture the inhomogeneous distribu - tion of stresses in the sample and their concentration along the so - called force chains [ 7 ] . In jammed systems of soft spheres , on the other hand , fragility has recently been shown to directly affect the deformation response of the system . While it may induce anomalous deformation ﬁelds that strongly deviate from the expectations of homogene - ous elasticity ( ‘‘nonafﬁne’’ deformations ) [ 8 ] , it may also lead to a proliferation of low - frequency vibrational states far beyond the usual Debye behavior of ordinary solids [ 9 ] . It has been argued that these low - energy vibrations derive from a set of zero - frequency modes ( ﬂoppy modes ) that are present just below the jamming threshold [ 10 ] and relate to the ability of the structure to internally rearrange without any change in its potential energy . This concept of ﬂoppy modes has also been used in connection with elastic per - colation networks where the fragile state is reached by diluting a certain fraction of nearest - neighbor contacts . In these systems , constraint - counting arguments may be used to determine the percolation transition at which the system loses its rigidity [ 11 ] . Here our focus is on a particular class of heterogeneous networks composed of cross - linked ﬁbers . These systems have recently been suggested as model systems for study - ing the mechanical properties of paper sheets [ 12 ] or biological networks of semiﬂexible polymers [ 13 , 14 ] . While these networks are known to have a rigidity perco - lation transition at low densities [ 15 , 16 ] , we show here that even networks in the high - density regime in many ways resemble the behavior of fragile matter , despite the fact that they are far away from the percolation threshold . We identify the relevant ﬂoppy modes and highlight their importance for understanding the macroscopic elasticity of the network . In particular , we will be able to explain the occurrence of an anomalous intermediate scaling regime observed in recent simulations [ 15 , 17 , 18 ] . In this regime , the shear modulus was found to depend on density ( mea - sured relative to the percolation threshold ) as G (cid:1) (cid:1)(cid:2) (cid:3) with a fractional exponent as large as (cid:3) (cid:2) 6 : 67 [ 15 ] . Also , highly nonafﬁne deformations [ 17 , 19 ] as well as inhomo - geneous distribution of stresses in the network have been found . Heuristic nonafﬁnity measures have been devised [ 17 , 19 ] ; however , little is known about the actual nature of the deformations present . While the expression ‘‘nonaf - ﬁne’’ is exclusively used to signal the absence of conven - tional homogeneous elasticity , scarce positive characterization of nonafﬁne deformations has been achieved up to now [ 20 ] . This Letter tries to ﬁll this gap by characterizing in detail the nonafﬁne deformation ﬁeld present in ﬁbrous networks . By relating nonafﬁnity to the ﬂoppy modes of the structure , we can , starting from a microscopic picture , calculate the macroscopic elastic moduli in both a scaling theory and a self - consistent ef - fective medium theory . In analogy with the afﬁne theory of rubber elasticity for ﬂexible polymer gels , our approach might very well serve as a second paradigm to understand the elasticity of microstructured materials . Because of the proximity to the fragile state , it might also be of relevance to force transmission in granular media and to the phe - nomenon of jamming . The two - dimensional ﬁber network we consider is de - ﬁned by randomly placing N elastic ﬁbers of length l f on a plane of area A (cid:3) L 2 such that both the position and orientation are uniformly distributed . We consider the ﬁber - ﬁber intersections to be perfectly rigid but freely rotatable cross - links that do not allow for relative sliding PRL 97 , 105501 ( 2006 ) P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S week ending 8 SEPTEMBER 2006 0031 - 9007 = 06 = 97 ( 10 ) = 105501 ( 4 ) 105501 - 1 © 2006 The American Physical Society of the ﬁlaments . The randomness entails a distribution of angles (cid:4)(cid:5) (cid:4) 0 ; (cid:6) (cid:5) between two intersecting ﬁlaments P (cid:6) (cid:4) (cid:7) (cid:3) sin (cid:6) (cid:4) (cid:7) 2 ; ( 1 ) while distances between neighboring intersections , the segment lengths l s , follow an exponential distribution [ 21 ] P (cid:6) l s (cid:7) (cid:3) h l s i (cid:8) 1 e (cid:8) l s = h l s i : ( 2 ) The mean segment length h l s i is inversely related to the line density (cid:2) (cid:3) Nl f = A as h l s i (cid:3) (cid:6) = 2 (cid:2) . The segments are modeled as classical beams with cross - section radius r and bending rigidity (cid:7) . Loaded along their axis ( ‘‘stretch - ing’’ ) , such slender rods have a rather high stiffness k k (cid:6) l s (cid:7) (cid:3) 4 (cid:7) = l s r 2 , while they are much softer with respect to transverse deformations k ? (cid:6) l s (cid:7) (cid:3) 3 (cid:7) = l 3 s ( ‘‘bending’’ ) . Numerical simulations for the effective shear modulus G of this network have identiﬁed a crossover scaling scenario characterized by a length scale (cid:8) (cid:3) l f (cid:6) (cid:1)(cid:2)l f (cid:7) (cid:8) (cid:9) and (cid:9) (cid:2) 2 : 84 [ 15 ] that mediates the transition between two drasti - cally different elastic regimes . For ﬁber radius r (cid:9) (cid:8) , the system is in an afﬁne regime where the elastic response is dominated mainly by stretching deformations homogene - ously distributed throughout the sample . The modulus in this regime is simply proportional to the typical stretching stiffness G aff / k k (cid:6)h l s i(cid:7) and independent of the ﬁber length l f . This is in marked contrast to the second regime at r (cid:10) (cid:8) . There , only nonafﬁne bending deformations are excited , and the modulus shows a strong dependence on ﬁber length G na / k ? (cid:6)h l s i(cid:7)(cid:6) l f = h l s i(cid:7) (cid:3) (cid:8) 3 . Using renormalization - group language , the parameters r and l f may be viewed as scaling ﬁelds ( measured in units of the ‘‘lattice constant’’ h l s i ) . The stretching dominated regime may then be characterized by an ( afﬁne ) ﬁxed point at l f ! 1 and ﬁnite radius r (cid:1) 0 . On the other hand , the ( nonafﬁne ) ﬁxed point of the bend - ing dominated regime is obtained by ﬁrst letting r ! 0 and then performing l f ! 1 . This suggests that the elastic properties in the latter regime may be analyzed at vanish - ing radius r (cid:3) 0 , that is , by putting the system on the stable manifold of the ﬁxed point . In the following , we will exploit this limit to calculate the modulus G na in the nonafﬁne regime . Central to the analysis is the recognition that in this limit the ratio of bending to stretching stiffness k ? = k k / r 2 tends to zero and bending deformations become increasingly soft . We thus obtain the much simpler problem of a central - force network . However , as only two ﬁbers may intersect at a cross - link , the coordination is z < 4 [ 22 ] and rigid regions may not percolate through the system [ 23 , 24 ] . This implies that , on a macroscopic level , the elastic moduli will be zero , while microscopically displacements can be chosen such that segment lengths need not be changed . These are the ﬂoppy modes of the structure that entail the fragility of the network in the bending dominated regime . It has been argued that a critical coordination of z c (cid:3) 4 is necessary to give the network rigidity [ 24 ] . This value deﬁnes the ‘‘iso - static’’ point , which in our network corresponds to taking the limit l f ! 1 . Thus , we arrive at the conclusion that isostaticity and the onset of rigidity seem to be intimately connected to the ﬁxed point governing the nonafﬁne re - gime . While it is usually not possible to deduce the speciﬁc form of the ﬂoppy modes , the ﬁbrous architecture allows for their straightforward construction ( see Fig . 1 ) . In a ﬁrst step , we perform an arbitrary axial displacement (cid:1)z of a given ( primary ) ﬁber as a whole . This , of course , will also affect the crossing ( secondary ) ﬁbers such that the lengths of interconnecting segments change . In a second step , therefore , one has to account for the length constraints on these segments by introducing cross - link deﬂections (cid:1) y i (cid:3) (cid:8) (cid:1)z cot (cid:4) i transverse to the contour of the primary ﬁber . As a result , all segment lengths remain unchanged to ﬁrst order in (cid:1)z [ 25 ] . The construction is , therefore , suitable to describe the linear response properties of the network , while at the same time it offers an explanation for the stiffening behavior found in fully nonlinear simulations [ 19 , 26 ] . Any ﬁnite strain necessarily leads to the energeti - cally more expensive stretching of bonds and , therefore , to an increase of the modulus . The identiﬁed modes take the form of localized excita - tions that affect only single ﬁlaments and their immediate surroundings . By superposition , we may therefore con - struct a displacement ﬁeld that allows the calculation of macroscopic quantities such as the elastic moduli . To achieve this , we need to know the typical magnitude of displacements (cid:1)z of a given ﬁber relative to its surround - ings , the crossing secondary ﬁbers . Since (cid:1)z is deﬁned on the scale of the complete ﬁber , we do not expect any dependence on average segment length h l s i , such that (cid:1)z / l f remains as the only conceivable possibility . Alterna - tively , one may obtain the same result by assuming that the individual ﬁber centers follow the macroscopic strain δ z y θ z y FIG . 1 ( color online ) .

Initial cross - link positions are marked as black squares , ﬁnal conﬁgurations as green circles .

Then relative displacements of centers of neighboring ﬁbers would be proportional to their typical distance . This is of the order ﬁlament length l f and again (cid:1)z / l f . Note , however , that the assumption of afﬁne displacement of the ﬁber centers cannot be literally true for ﬁbers intersecting at very small angles (cid:4) ! 0 . To avoid a diverging transverse deﬂection (cid:1) y i (cid:3) (cid:8) (cid:1)z cot (cid:4) ! 1 , the two ﬁbers will most likely not experience any relative motion at all and (cid:1)z ! 0 . Truly afﬁne displacements can , therefore , be established only on scales larger than the ﬁlament length . It should also be clear that the assump - tion of afﬁne displacements of the ﬁber centers is different from the usual approach of assigning afﬁne deformations on the scale of the single segment . The latter would lead to deformations (cid:1) aff / l s , proportional to the length l s of the segment . Instead , axial displacements of the ﬁber as a whole are , by construction of the ﬂoppy mode , directly translated into nonafﬁne deformations (cid:1) na / l f , which do not depend on the length of the segment . Restoring the radius r to its ﬁnite value , the ﬂoppy modes acquire energy and lead to bending of the ﬁbers . A segment of length l s will then typically store the energy w b (cid:6) l s (cid:7) ’ (cid:7)(cid:1) 2na = l 3 s ’ (cid:7)l 2 f = l 3 s . By averaging over the segment length distribution Eq . ( 2 ) , one may calculate the average bending energy h W b i , stored in a ﬁber consisting of n ’ (cid:2)l f segments , h W b i ’ (cid:2)l f Z 1 l min dl s P (cid:6) l s (cid:7) (cid:7)(cid:1) 2na l 3 s : ( 3 ) We assume the integral to be regularized by a lower cutoff length l min that we now determine in a self - consistent manner . Physically , l min corresponds to the shortest seg - ments along the ﬁber that contribute to the elastic energy . Even though we know [ see Eq . ( 2 ) ] that arbitrarily short segments do exist , their high bending stiffness k ? (cid:6) l s (cid:7) / l (cid:8) 3 s makes their deformation increasingly expensive . Segments with length l s < l min will , therefore , be able to relax from their ﬂoppy mode deformation (cid:1) na , thereby reducing their bending energy from w b (cid:6) l min (cid:7) to nearly zero . However , due to the length constraints , this relaxation necessarily leads to the movement of an entire secondary ﬁber and to the excitation of a ﬂoppy mode there . By balancing w b (cid:6) l min (cid:7) (cid:3) h W b i , this gives l min ’ 1 = (cid:2) 2 l f and for the average bending energy of a single ﬁber h W b i ’ (cid:7) = l f (cid:6) (cid:2)l f (cid:7) 6 . This implies for the modulus G na ’ (cid:2) = l f h W b i / (cid:2) 7 , which compares well with the simulation result of (cid:3) (cid:3) 6 : 67 . What is more , by equating the energy h W b i with h W s i ’ (cid:7)l f r (cid:8) 2 valid in the afﬁne stretching regime , one can also infer the crossover exponent (cid:9) (cid:3) 3 . In summary , we have succeeded in explaining the elas - ticity of the bending dominated regime starting from the microscopic picture of the ﬂoppy modes that characterize directly the deformation ﬁeld deep inside the nonafﬁne regime . Alternatively , one might try to understand the emergent nonafﬁnity in a perturbative approach that con - siders deviations from an afﬁne reference state . Such a line of reasoning has recently been suggested in Ref . [ 18 ] , where nonafﬁne boundary layers , growing from the ﬁla - ment ends , are assumed to perturb the perfect afﬁne order . However , comparing with their simulation data , the au - thors could not conﬁrm the scaling picture unambiguously and acknowledged the need for further numerical as well as improved theoretical work [ 18 ] . Thus , nonafﬁne elasticity in ﬁbrous networks appears to be intrinsically a nonpertur - bative strong - coupling phenomenon for which the ﬂoppy mode picture provides the correct low - energy excitations . As we will explicitly show next , one particular strength of our approach is that the scaling picture can readily be extended to a full theory that self - consistently calculates the modulus in a nonafﬁne effective medium theory . To set up the theory , we consider a single ﬁlament together with its cross - links that provide the coupling to the medium . The energy of this assembly consists of two parts . First , the bending energy of the primary ﬁber W b (cid:4) y (cid:6) z (cid:7)(cid:5) (cid:3) (cid:7) 2 Z (cid:1) @ 2 y @ z 2 (cid:2) 2 dz ; ( 4 ) due to a transverse deﬂection y (cid:6) z (cid:7) . A second stretching energy contribution arises whenever a cross - link deﬂection y i (cid:3) y (cid:6) z i (cid:7) differs from its prescribed value (cid:1) y i (cid:3) (cid:8) (cid:1)z cot (cid:4) i and may be written in the form of an harmonic conﬁning potential W s (cid:6) y i (cid:7) (cid:3) 12 k i (cid:6) y i (cid:8) (cid:1) y i (cid:7) 2 that acts individually on each of the n ’ (cid:2)l f cross - links . It allows the ﬁlament to reduce its own energy at the cost of deforming the elastic matrix into which it is imbedded .

As we have argued above , any relaxation of this kind must act as axial displacement on a secondary ﬁber , thus exciting a new ﬂoppy mode there . The energy scale associated with this is h W i such that we can write k (cid:6) (cid:4) i (cid:7) (cid:3) 2 h W i sin 2 (cid:6) (cid:4) i (cid:7) (cid:1)z 2 ; ( 6 ) where the angular dependence derives from the projection onto the axis of the secondary ﬁlament . Equations ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) represent a closed set of equations to calculate the conﬁgurationally averaged deformation energy h W i as a function of the number of cross - links n . In implementing this scheme , we have generated ensembles of ﬁlaments with a distribution of cross - linking angles as given by Eq . ( 1 ) and segment lengths according to Eq . ( 2 ) . Note that there is no free parameter in this calculation . The equations are solved graphically in Fig . 2 by plotting both sides of Eq . ( 5 ) as a function of h W i . The point of intersection , which solves the equation , is shown in the inset as a function of the number of cross - links n . For the same parameter window as used in the network simulations [ 15 ] , it yields the scaling behavior of h W i / n 5 : 75 . This implies for the modulus the exponent of (cid:3) (cid:3) 6 : 75 , which improves upon the simple scaling picture presented above and provides a very accurate calculation of the scaling exponent (cid:3) . In conclusion , we have succeeded in deriving the macro - scopic elasticity of random ﬁbrous networks starting from a microscopic description of the displacement ﬁeld in a manner that does not rely on the notion of afﬁne deforma - tions . We have given a ﬂoppy mode construction that may be applied to any two - or three - dimensional network with ﬁbrous architecture , for example , paper or biological net - works of semiﬂexible ﬁlaments . It may also be shown to be relevant to systems where the constraint of straight ﬁbers is relaxed [ 26 ] . The unusually strong density dependence of the modulus found here is a consequence of the exponen - tial segment length distribution Eq . ( 2 ) and the presence of the length scale l min . While identiﬁcation of the ﬂoppy modes has been recognized to be highly important for a description of force transmission in granular media or the jamming transition in colloidal systems , one can rarely give the exact form of these zero - energy excitations . On the contrary , we have achieved an explicit construction of the ﬂoppy modes that can be put in the form of localized elementary excitations affecting only single ﬁlaments and their immediate surroundings .
