Received : July 2022 ; Accepted : August 2022 ; Published online : 19 October 2022 Abstract : Introduction : It is critical to quickly and easily identify severe coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) patients and predict their mortality . This study aimed to determine the accuracy of the physiologic scoring systems in predicting the mortality of COVID - 19 patients . Methods : This prospective cross - sectional study was per - formed on COVID - 19 patients admitted to the emergency department ( ED ) . The clinical characteristics of the participants were collected by the emergency physicians and the accuracy of the Quick Sequential Failure As - sessment ( qSOFA ) , Coronavirus Clinical Characterization Consortium ( 4C ) Mortality , National Early Warning Score - 2 ( NEWS2 ) , and Pandemic Respiratory Infection Emergency System Triage ( PRIEST ) scores for mortality prediction was evaluated . Results : Nine hundred and twenty - one subjects were included . Of whom , 745 ( 80 . 9 % ) patients survived after 30 days of admission . The mean age of patients was 59 . 13 ± 17 . 52 years , and 550 ( 61 . 6 % ) subjects were male . Non - Survived patients were signiﬁcantly older ( 66 . 02 ± 17 . 80 vs . 57 . 45 ± 17 . 07 , P < 0 . 001 ) and had more comorbidities ( diabetes mellitus , respiratory , cardiovascular , and cerebrovascular disease ) in compar - ison with survived patients . For COVID - 19 mortality prediction , the AUROCs of PRIEST , qSOFA , NEWS2 , and 4C Mortality score were 0 . 846 ( 95 % CI [ 0 . 821 - 0 . 868 ] ) , 0 . 788 ( 95 % CI [ 0 . 760 - 0 . 814 ] ) , 0 . 843 ( 95 % CI [ 0 . 818 - 0 . 866 ] ) , and 0 . 804 ( 95 % CI [ 0 . 776 - 0 . 829 ] ) , respectively . All scores were good predictors of COVID - 19 mortality . Conclu - sion : All studied physiologic scores were good predictors of COVID - 19 mortality and could be a useful screening tool for identifying high - risk patients . The NEWS2 and PRIEST scores predicted mortality in COVID - 19 patients signiﬁcantly better than qSOFA .

Introduction The coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) , a respiratory dis - ease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coron - avirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) , has unfolded globally with unheard - of rapidity ( 1 ) . COVID - 19 has had a devastating impact on health care , internationally ( 1 , 2 ) . 6 to 20 % of sufferers need to be hospitalized ( 2 , 3 ) . The incidence of critical disorder This open - access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution NonCommercial 3 . 0 License ( CC BY - NC 3 . 0 ) .

Heydari et al . 2 amongst hospitalized patients is about 5 - 20 % , and intensive care treatment may also be required in > 25 % of them ( 4 , 5 ) . The mortality rate amongst hospitalized subjects is esti - mated to be 11 - 28 % ( 2 , 6 ) . Therefore , it is essential to identify subjects that emerge as severely or even critically ill quickly and without problems , which can help in allocation of the limited medical and mon - itoring resources . Using scoring systems to estimate a pa - tient’s risk of unfavorable outcome can decrease unnecessary use of the limited available resources ( 1 , 2 , 5 ) . Several medi - cal scoring tools have been used For risk stratiﬁcation regard - ing sepsis and community - acquired pneumonia ( CAP ) ( 2 , 5 ) . There are several valid scoring systems for predicting pneu - monia mortality . The Quick Sequential Failure Assessment ( qSOFA ) criteria were developed in 2016 ( 2 , 5 ) to predict mor - tality in septic patients . Still , recent research has recom - mended that qSOFA is an effective tool to evaluate mortality risk in seriously ill subjects with a variety of diseases , espe - cially in resource - constrained eventualities ( 7 , 8 ) . The Coronavirus Clinical Characterization Consortium ( 4C ) Mortality Score was developed by the International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infections Consortium ( IS - ARIC ) . It was used on adult hospitalized COVID - 19 patients in England , Wales , and Scotland to predict 30 - day mortality ( 9 , 10 ) . In studies conducted on emergency department ( ED ) pa - tients , the National Early Warning Score ( NEWS ) was the most accurate in predicting in - hospital mortality ( 11 ) . In 2017 , NEWS was updated to NEWS2 by adding new oxygen saturation ( SpO2 ) scoring scale . NEWS2 is recommended by the Royal College of Physicians for use in COVID - 19 pa - tients ( 11 ) and is a standardized scoring tool developed to improve the detection of deterioration in acutely ill patients ( 12 ) . NEWS2 has shown good ability in prediction of ad - verse outcomes in patients attending the ED with suspected COVID - 19 . In 2021 , Pandemic Respiratory Infection Emergency System Triage ( PRIEST ) tool was developed and validated among adult patients with suspected COVID - 19 in ED to address any pandemic respiratory infection , including COVID - 19 . It was created by adding age , sex , and performance status to NEWS2 ( 13 ) . The present study was performed at the time of the circu - lation of the Delta variant . Previous studies have suggested that physiologic scoring systems are practical tools to assess mortality risk in critically ill patients ( 9 - 14 ) . Therefore , these scores can assist emergency physicians in predicting the mortality of COVID - 19 hospitalized patients . This study was conducted to estimate and compare the accu - racy of the qSOFA , 4C Mortality , NEWS2 , and PRIEST scores in predicting the mortality of COVID - 19 patients in the emer - gency department setting . 2 . Methods 2 . 1 . Study setting and design This prospective cross - sectional study was conducted at Al - Zahra hospital ( a university - afﬁliated , COVID - 19 refer - ral hospital ) in Isfahan , Iran , between June 22 , 2021 , and November 21 , 2021 ( at the time of circulation of the Delta variant of the coronavirus ) . The clinical characteristics of the participants were collected by the emergency physicians and the accuracy of the Quick Sequential Failure Assessment ( qSOFA ) , Coronavirus Clinical Characterization Consortium ( 4C ) Mortality , National Early Warning Score - 2 ( NEWS2 ) , and Pandemic Respiratory Infection Emergency System Triage ( PRIEST ) scores in prediction of one - month mortality was evaluated . This study was approved by the ethics commit - tee of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences ( code : IR . MUI . MED . REC . 1399 . 932 ) , and the study participants signed the informed consent . 2 . 2 . Participants Adult subjects ( over 18 years of age ) with conﬁrmed COVID - 19 infection , who were admitted to the emergency depart - ment ( ED ) of Al - Zahra hospital were eligible for study par - ticipation . COVID - 19 infection was established according to the WHO interim guidance ( 15 ) . Pregnant patients , those who disagreed to participate in the study , those hospitalized for other medical conditions unrelated to COVID - 19 , and pa - tients transferred from other hospitals were excluded . 2 . 3 . Data collection The emergency medicine residents evaluated and managed the patients in the ED based on the standard protocol at Al - Zahra Hospital . The patients’ demographic information ( gender and age ) , baseline variables , and clinical and labo - ratory data were collected on ED admission . Clinical data including signs and symptoms , blood pressure ( BP ) , respi - ratory rate ( RR ) , heart rate ( HR ) , AVPU ( ’Alert’ , ’Voice’ , ’Pain’ , ’Unresponsive’ ) , temperature , O2 saturation ( SpO2 ) , labora - tory ﬁndings , and triage level based on Emergency Severity Index ( ESI ) version 4 , and chest computed tomography ( CT ) scans were recorded . These data were extracted to calculate theqSOFA , 4CMortality , NEWS2 , andPRIESTscores . Thepri - mary outcome was mortality within 30 days after admission to the ED . TheqSOFAconsistsofthreeparameters . Onepointisallotted to each variable : SBP ≤ 100 mm Hg , RR ≥ 22 breaths / minute , and altered mental status ( GCS < 15 ) . The score ranges from 0 to 3 ( 7 ) . The NEWS2 tool comprises six physiological variables ( RR , SpO2 , SBP , HR , level of consciousness or new confusion , and temperature ) . Each variable is scored from 0 to 3 . Finally , two This open - access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution NonCommercial 3 . 0 License ( CC BY - NC 3 . 0 ) .

The NEWS - 2 assessment categorizes patients into low risk ( 0 – 4 ) , medium risk ( 5 – 6 ) , and high risk ( ≥ 7 ) . The PRIEST score can be calculated by adding age and gen - der , and performance status to the parameters of the NEWS2 score ( Appendix 1 ) . The score ranges from zero to 29 points ( 13 ) . The 4C Mortality Score includes eight variables ( age , sex , number of comorbidities , RR , SpO2 , GCS , BUN level , and C - reactive protein level ) ( Appendix 2 ) . The total score ranges between 0 and 21 points ( 9 ) . 2 . 4 . Statistical analysis Based on similar studies ( 2 ) , assuming speciﬁcity of 80 % , the mortality rate of 20 % , the estimation accuracy of 95 % , and type - 1 error of 3 % , the minimum required sample size was 853 people . SPSS software version 25 . 0 ( IBM , Armonk , NY ) was applied to analyze the variables . Categorical data were described as frequency ( % ) , and continuous data were ex - pressed as mean and standard deviation ( SD ) or 95 % conﬁ - dence interval ( CI ) . Chi - square test and Student’s t - test , or the Mann - Whitney U test were performed to compare vari - ables . Thearea under areceiveroperatingcharacteristic ( AU - ROC ) curve was calculated to evaluate and compare the ef - fectiveness of the qSOFA , 4C Mortality , NEWS2 , and PRIEST scores in predicting mortality . P - value less than 0 . 05 in two - tailed tests was considered signiﬁcant . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . Patients’ baseline characteristics Nine hundred and twenty - one subjects were included in this study . Of them , 745 ( 80 . 9 % ) patients had survived 30 days af - ter admission . The mean age of patients was 59 . 13 ± 17 . 52 years , and 550 ( 61 . 6 % ) subjects were male . The mean length of hospital stay was 8 . 69 ± 8 . 91 days . The most common underlying diseases were hypertension ( 32 . 6 % ) and diabetes ( 32 . 2 % ) . The most common symptoms on admission were dyspnea ( 72 . 6 % ) and fever ( 65 . 1 % ) . The baseline characteris - tics and laboratory parameters of survived and non - survived patients are compared in table 1 and 2 . Non - Survived patients were signiﬁcantly older ( 66 . 02 ± 17 . 80 vs . 57 . 45 ± 17 . 07 , P < 0 . 001 ) and had more comorbidities ( di - abetes mellitus , respiratory , cardiovascular , and cerebrovas - cular disease ) in comparison with survived patients . Among vital parameters on ED admission , SpO2 , RR and HR sig - niﬁcantly differed between survived and non - survived pa - tients . There were signiﬁcant differences between survivor and non - survivor patients regarding GCS , length of hospital stay , qSOFA , PRIEST , NEWS2 , and 4C Mortality scores . The lymphocyte counts and hemoglobin in non - survived pa - Figure 1 : Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of different scoring systems in predicting the 30 - day mortality of COVID - 19 patients . tients were signiﬁcantly lower than survived patients ( P < 0 . 001 ) . The d - Dimer , blood sugar , and Lactate Dehydroge - nase levels in non - survived patients were signiﬁcantly higher than those who survived . 3 . 2 . Comparing the Accuracy of scoring systems ROC curves were drawn to calculate the sensitivity , speci - ﬁcity , positive predictive value ( PPV ) , negative predictive value ( NPV ) , and cut - off values of scores to predict COVID - 19 mortality . The optimal cut - off values of ≥ 2 for the qSOFA , ≥ 8 for PRIEST , ≥ 6 for NEWS2 , and ≥ 13 for the 4C Mortal - ity score were established . The NPV of the PRIEST , qSOFA , NEWS2 , and 4C Mortality scores for mortality were 96 . 0 % , 95 . 2 % , 94 . 0 % , and 91 . 5 % , respectively ( Table 3 ) . For COVID - 19 mortality prediction , the AUROCs of PRIEST , qSOFA , NEWS2 , and 4C Mortality score were 0 . 846 ( 95 % CI [ 0 . 821 - 0 . 868 ] ) , 0 . 788 ( 95 % CI [ 0 . 760 - 0 . 814 ] ) , 0 . 843 ( 95 % CI [ 0 . 818 - 0 . 866 ] ) , and 0 . 804 ( 95 % CI [ 0 . 776 - 0 . 829 ] ) , respectively . All scores were good predictors of COVID - 19 mortality ( Fig - ure 1 ) . The AUROC analysis showed that the NEWS2 and PRIEST scores were more successful than qSOFA ( P = 0 . 004 and P = 0 . 001 ) in predicting mortality for COVID - 19 patients ( Table 4 ) . 4 . Discussion Due to the limitations of medical resources during the COVID - 19 outbreak , it is essential to initially assess COVID - 19 patients in terms of disease severity to ensure primary medical management and interventions .

In such situations , scoring systems can help overcome limita - tions . Each scoring tool has its advantages and disadvan - tages . The 30 - day mortality in the current study was high ( 19 . 1 % ) . It was in line with previous studies ( ranging from 19 . 2 % to 20 . 9 % ) ( 2 , 6 , 10 ) . Consistent with the current study , pre - vious studies have shown that non - survived COVID - 19 pa - tients were signiﬁcantly older , had a higher respiratory rate , a lower SpO2 on ED arrival , and had more underlying diseases than those who survived ( 2 , 5 , 8 , 11 ) . Most patients presented with respiratory tract symptoms such as dyspnea and cough , fever , and fatigue . Previous stud - ies reported that the most common symptoms include cough ( 60 – 86 % ) , dyspnea ( 53 – 80 % ) , and taste or smell disturbance ( 64 – 80 % ) ( 10 , 17 - 19 ) . These results are similar to the present study . The current study has compared the performance of four different scoring systems in predicting COVID - 19 mortality .

PRIEST score did not perform signiﬁcantly better than the NEWS2 score . Covino et al . demonstrated that NEWS2 predicted death within 48 hours from ED admission with AUROC of 0 . 753 [ 95 % CI 0 . 703 - 0 . 798 ] , with 72 . 7 % [ 95 % CI 39 . 0 - 94 . 0 ] sensitivity and 72 . 7 % [ 95 % CI 67 . 6 - 77 . 5 ] speciﬁcity ( 11 ) . In another study , NEWS2 demonstrated an AUROC of 0 . 78 for in - hospital mortality ( 4 ) . Previous studies reported that NEWS - 2 had an excellent per - formance ( AUC = 0 . 842 – 0 . 894 ) ( 13 , 20 , 21 ) . They showed that NEWS - 2 was the best tool for evaluating the prognosis of COVID - 19 patients compared to several other tools ( 12 , 20 ) . These ﬁndings were in line with the present study .

Downloadedfrom : http : / / journals . sbmu . ac . ir / aaem F . Heydari et al . 6 can be used as a triage tool to predict the mortality of COVID - 19 patients and allocate the limited resources . The diagnostic ability of qSOFA for the prediction of hospi - tal mortality in the current study ( AUROC = 0 . 788 ) was com - parable to Liu et al . ( AUROC = 0 . 742 ) , Wilfong et al . ( AU - ROC = 0 . 801 ) , and Jang et al . ( AUROC = 0 . 779 ) in COVID - 19 pa - tients ( 16 , 22 , 23 ) . These ﬁndings showed that qSOFA is quite a good tool for predicting hospital mortality in COVID - 19 pa - tients . The PRIEST study examined 20891 suspected COVID - 19 pa - tients in 70 emergency departments . Triage scores provided goodbutnot excellentdiscriminationwithgood sensitivity at the expense of speciﬁcity in patients with suspected COVID - 19 ( 24 ) . This study did not suggest any cut - off point to apply for decision - making in COVID - 19 patients . Goodacre et al . demonstrated that PRIEST scores ≥ 5 predicted 30 - day mor - tality with 98 % sensitivity ( 13 ) . Marincowitz et al . reported that the NEWS2 and PRIEST scores achieved high estimated sensitivities concerning 30 - day mortality ( 14 ) . In the present study , the additional components of the PRIEST score im - proved sensitivity and NPV . The 4C Mortality score has been validated in over 57 , 000 pa - tients in previous studies in several settings ( 4 , 9 , 10 , 25 , 26 ) . The AUROC of the 4C Mortality score in the present study ( 0 . 804 [ 95 % CI , 0 . 776 - 0 . 829 ] ) is consistent with the results of previous studies in other countries . The AUROC of the 4C Mortality score was 0 . 84 ( 95 % CI , 0 . 79 - 0 . 88 ) in a Dutch pop - ulation ( 25 ) , 0 . 78 ( 95 % CI , 0 . 75 - 0 . 81 ) in a Brazilian and Span - ish population ( 26 ) , and 0 . 85 ( 95 % CI , 0 . 79 - 0 . 89 ) in a United States population ( 27 ) . Citu et al . showed that the NEWS with an AUROC of 0 . 861 predicted mortality in COVID - 19 patients and was signiﬁ - cantly superior to the 4C Mortality score ( AUROC = 0 . 818 ) ( 28 ) . Ocho et al . demonstrated that for mortality prediction , AUROC of the 4C Mortality score ( 0 . 84 [ 95 % CI , 0 . 76 – 0 . 92 ] ) was higher than qSOFA ( 0 . 66 [ 95 % CI , 0 . 53 – 0 . 78 ] ) ( 29 ) . These results were similar to the present study . Therefore , the 4C Mortality score is a useful tool to assess mortality risk in COVID - 19 patients . The NPV of the PRIEST , qSOFA , NEWS2 , and 4C Mortality scores for in - hospital mortality were 96 . 0 % , 95 . 2 % , 94 . 0 % , and 91 . 5 % , respectively . The high NPV acts as a gatekeeper accurately identifying low - risk patients . The PRIEST had the highest sensitivity and NPV for mortality prediction . Thus , it is particularly well in identifying COVID - 19 patients who were at low risk of death . For triaging patients in the ED , it is importanttohaveahighNPVforpredictingsevereCOVID - 19 to avoid inappropriately admitting patients at risk of deteri - oration to a non - critical care area . The PRIEST , qSOFA , and NEWS2 scores are calculated with - out laboratory tests or diagnostic imaging , while the 4C Mor - tality score needs laboratory tests . Therefore , the 4C Mortal - ity score is more time - consuming than others . The PRIEST , qSOFA , and NEWS2 scores can predict patient deterioration quickly and simply in COVID - 19 patients who need imme - diate treatment to minimize mortality in COVID - 19 patients . Although a single evaluation on hospital admission has lim - ited predictive ability , these scores could be a helpful screen - ing tool to evaluate COVID - 19 patients at the time of ED ar - rival . However , these should only supplement and not re - place clinical judgment . Due to silent hypoxemia in severe COVID - 19 , the accuracy of the qSOFA score in predicting hospital mortality decreases . These patients appear to breathe comfortably even at low SPO2 . This score only counts the respiratory rate and does not consider SpO2 . Therefore , it has limitations in predicting mortality in COVID - 19 patients . An advantage of other scores compared to the qSOFA is that both hypoxemia and respira - tory rate are included as scoring parameters . 5 . Limitations Our study has some limitations . A convenience sampling method was used , and the researcher was present in the ED , which may have caused selection bias . This study was a single - center study with limited generalizability , and the ﬁndings may not apply to other environments with different populations or healthcare systems . Additionally , the value of a single evaluation is limited , and patients admitted to the hospital should be reassessed frequently for signs of deterio - ration . 6 . Conclusion All studied physiologic scores were good predictors of COVID - 19 mortality and these can be considered a useful screening tool to identify the high - risk patients . The NEWS2 and PRIEST scores predicted mortality in COVID - 19 patients signiﬁcantly better than qSOFA . 7 . Declarations 7 . 1 .
