ABSTRACT Embodied Pedagogical Agents ( EPAs ) possess significant potential for using multimodal interactions to effectively convey social and educational information . While previous studies have examined the impact of EPAs on learning performance , the incorporation of mean - ingful gestures into EPAs remains relatively unexplored . This study employs a case study approach and systemic functional - multimodal discourse analysis to investigate the multimodal interactions of a hu - man lecturer during teaching and explores the relationship between in - class meaningful gestures and corresponding words . We analyze the alignment between gestures , words , and contextual meanings , with a specific focus on personal pronouns , adjectives , adverbs , and verbs . The findings contribute to the understanding of lecturers’ multimodal orchestration in classroom settings . Additionally , we provide a preliminary design guideline for EPAs that integrates meaningful word - synchronized gestures , using multimodal infor - mation to enhance students’ embodied learning experiences .

Numerous studies have evaluated the impact of EPAs on students’ learning performance [ 4 , 7 , 13 , 20 , 22 ] . Recent research has shown that PAs with high levels of human - like behaviors positively influence students’ per - ception of social presence [ 31 , 33 ] . Additionally , studies have indi - cated that PAs incorporating meaningful gestures , such as deictics , iconics , and metaphorics , can enhance students’ learning outcomes 39 CSCW ’23 Companion , October 14 – 18 , 2023 , Minneapolis , MN , USA Lai Wei and Kenny K . N . Chow [ 8 , 30 , 35 ] . Scholars have noted that teachers across different re - gions use gestures during instructional analogies to foster students’ abstract thinking and enhance comprehension [ 26 , 27 ] . Therefore , it is crucial to investigate the multimodal interactions of human lecturers during in - class teaching to inform the design of EPAs that incorporate meaningful gestures . While some researchers have explored co - speech gesture gener - ation for designing gestural agents , with focuses on speech rhythm [ 1 , 16 , 19 ] and word embedding [ 34 ] , the incorporation of mean - ingful word - synchronized gestures into EPAs remains largely un - explored . Examining the natural movements of human lecturers and their alignment with speech in real - life teaching scenarios holds promise for designing EPAs that incorporate meaningful word - synchronized gestures , ultimately leading to improved stu - dent learning effectiveness . This study presents an initial understanding of the alignments between lecturers’ gestures and corresponding words and their parts of speech , specifically focusing on personal pronouns , adjec - tives , adverbs , and verbs . The findings contribute in the following ways : 1 ) It provides empirical insights into the alignment between gestures , words , and their contextual meanings . 2 ) It offers a prelim - inary exploration of word - synchronized gestures used by human lecturers . 3 ) It presents the design of word - synchronized gestural EPAs that use integrated multimodal information to convey con - textual meanings and enhance embodied learning experiences for students . 2 RELATED WORK 2 . 1 Gesture Gesture , as an essential form of multimodal interaction , reflects human thought and enhances language semantics [ 10 , 15 , 23 ] . Previ - ous studies on human gestures have primarily focused on three key attributes : gesture types , continuum , and meanings . McNeill identi - fied five types of gestures : beats , cohesives , deictics , metaphorics , and iconics [ 21 ] . Furthermore , gesture exhibits a continuum pro - cess , involving four stages : pre - preparation position , pre - stroke hold , stroke , and post - stroke hold , which convey a chronological system of gestures’ trajectory [ 15 ] . The study of gesture types and continuum has been adopted in the field of human - computer in - teraction to understand the representations of human cognitive processes and behavioral patterns [ 24 , 25 , 29 ] . Lim formulated a social - related classification of gestures [ 24 ] , which includes com - municative gestures reflecting self - representation and language correlation , as well as performative gestures [ 18 ] . This study draws on the classifications of gestures by McNeill [ 21 ] , Kendon [ 34 ] , and Lim [ 18 ] to identify word - synchronized gestures of a lecturer in a real - life teaching environment , aiming to gain an initial understanding of the in - class multimodal interaction exhib - ited by human lecturers . 2 . 2 Word Verbal language serves as the primary communication medium be - tween lecturers and students [ 28 ] . It has been observed that human communicative signals are often accompanied by the integration of spoken language and gestures [ 2 ] . Neuroscientific research has indicated that human comprehension and pronunciation of words , particularly their meanings and part - of - speech ( PoS , e . g . , adjec - tives , adverbs , verbs , etc . ) , rely on sensorimotor systems rather than purely linguistic systems , which primarily function in abstract word awareness [ 5 , 9 , 14 ] . The meanings of words that relate to images and pictorial scenarios often elicit iconic gestures . For in - stance , these gestures , such as mimicking drinking when engaging in a conversation about thirst , serve as vivid visual representations of the concepts they embody [ 32 ] . The alignment of words with gestures holds great potential for uncovering the multimodal inter - action exhibited by human lecturers . However , research focusing on analyzing the PoS of words in lectures and their corresponding gestures is relatively scarce . Exploring word usage within linguistic contexts shows promise in understanding the gestures employed by lecturers . 3 A CASE STUDY The case study approach shows potential in revealing multimodal interactions , specifically the alignment between a lecturer’s ges - tures and words , and it offers an initial design guideline for EPAs incorporating word - synchronized gestures . To analyze the mean - ings conveyed through linguistic and gestural elements , this study adopts a lens of Systemic Functional Theory [ 17 ] . By employing systemic functional - multimodal discourse analysis , the study aligns gesture and action type analysis with content analysis , thus explor - ing the relationship between gestures and words . 3 . 1 Subject , Research Site , and Procedure Based on the characteristics of natural behaviors exhibited by in - structors in a real - life teaching setting , we conducted an initial study in a typical university classroom ( a square - shaped room with the lecturer standing at the front ) . To ensure high - quality in - class gesture data , specific requirements were established for participant recruitment . The recruited instructor had to meet two criteria : 1 ) actively using gestures to capture students’ attention and enhance comprehension , and 2 ) having noticeable and substantial in - class gestures as reported by students . A male participant , identified as George ( a pseudonym ) , was re - cruited for the study . George is a university lecturer with ten years of teaching experience at the undergraduate level , specializing in the field of design . He met the recruitment requirements and will - ingly participated in the study . The observed course was George’s class on user experience design . During the class session , a camera was positioned at a 3 / 4 angle approximately 3 meters away from the instructor . One of our re - searchers was present to observe the instructor’s actions and en - sure uninterrupted operation of the camera , without disrupting the regular teaching process . Around thirty university students were present in the classroom , attentively listening to George’s lecture . The observation and video recording lasted for one hour , encom - passing George’s speech , non - verbal behaviors , and the entirety of the teaching process . 3 . 2 Materials The study used the multimodal discourse analysis software ELAN . Four tiers were created , recorded , annotated , and analyzed , encom - passing lecturer action types , gesture types and continuum , as well 40 When Gestures and Words Synchronize : Exploring A Human Lecturer’s Multimodal Interaction toward the Design of Embodied Pedagogical Agents CSCW ’23 Companion , October 14 – 18 , 2023 , Minneapolis , MN , USA Table 1 : A Description of Gesture Types and Continuum , and Action Types from George’s Lecture Video Recording Gesture Type Beats Cohesives Deictics Iconics Metaphorics Null Total Fre . 1040 560 461 83 284 374 2802 % 37 . 1 20 . 0 16 . 5 3 . 0 10 . 1 13 . 3 100 . 0 Duration ( ms ) Ave . 1693 863 . 53 965 . 62 1575 . 3 1356 . 25 Max . 23970 9100 15060 7800 15770 Total 1760715 483577 445150 130750 375680 3195872 Action type IndexicalAction PresentingAction RepresentingAction Null Total Fre . 1640 202 731 229 2802 % 58 . 5 7 . 2 26 . 1 8 . 2 100 . 0 RepresentingandPresentingAction BehaviorProcess InterpersonalMeanings MaterialProcess Null Total Fre . 108 1987 511 196 2802 % 3 . 9 70 . 9 18 . 2 6 . 9 100 . 0 Pre - preparation position Prestroke hold Stroke Post - stroke hold Null Total Gesture Continuum Fre . 261 239 1655 347 300 2802 % 9 . 3 8 . 5 61 . 0 12 . 4 10 . 7 100 . 0 Null = George doesn’t show any bodily language ; Fre . = the frequency of certain gesture type in George’s lecture ; % = percentage of certain gesture type in George’s lecture ; Ave . = the average duration of certain gesture type in George’s lecture ; Max . = the maximum duration of certain gesture type in George’s lecture . as speech content , to examine lecturers’ social involvement . An online transcription service was employed to transcribe the spoken words in George’s lecture video , resulting in a total of 13 , 659 words that were manually reviewed for accuracy . During the manual re - view , the use of personal pronouns , adjectives , adverbs , and verbs was specifically annotated . Data analysis involved the use of statis - tical software to calculate word frequencies and their co - occurrence with gestures . 3 . 3 Lecturer’s Gestures and Words Synchronize 3 . 3 . 1 George’s In - class Gesture Description . We have annotated the frequency and duration ( i . e . , total , average , maximum ) of the five gesture types in George’s lecture video recording , as well as the frequency and percentage of gesture continuum and action types , using SPSS . The data is presented in Table 1 . George performed the beats gesture 1040 times , with a maximum duration of 23970ms and an average duration of 1693ms . He used cohesive gestures 560 times , with a maximum duration of 9100ms and an average duration of 863 . 53ms . Deictic gestures occurred 461 times , with a maximum duration of 15060ms and an average duration of 965 . 62ms . Iconic gestures were used 83 times , with a maximum duration of 7800ms and an average duration of 1575 . 3ms . Metaphoric gestures were observed 277 times , with a maximum duration of 15770ms and an average duration of 1356 . 25ms . Additionally , George used non - bodily movements 374 times . The data reveals that George extensively used beats gestures ( 37 . 1 % ) in terms of both frequency and duration . Cohesive gestures occurred frequently and had shorter durations , suggesting their common usage as auxiliary gestures . Deictic gestures had a rela - tively high usage rate ( 16 . 5 % ) , and metaphoric gestures ( 10 . 1 % ) also showed significant frequency . George used deictic and metaphoric gestures relatively more . Although he used iconic gestures less frequently , their average duration was longer . Contiguous stroking gestures ( 61 % ) were highly observed , while gestures in the gesture preparation stage ( pre - preparation position : 9 . 3 % ; pre - stroke hold : 8 . 5 % ) were less frequent . Indexical action ( 58 . 5 % ) and representing action ( 26 . 1 % ) were highly exhibited , with interpersonal meanings ( 70 . 9 % ) showing a significant presence . During George’s one - hour lecture , he intentionally interacted with students and used abundant nonverbal language to comple - ment his verbal explanations . He engaged in numerous social ac - tions while teaching . George effectively used gestures primarily to interact with students and the physical teaching environment . Based on the results of gesture frequency and duration in the class - room , we consider the analysis of George’s gestures feasible for gaining an initial understanding of intentionally embodied interac - tion by human lecturers . 3 . 3 . 2 The Alignments between Gestures and Words . Based on George’s speech , we found he used the pronoun " I " 41 times , " we " 30 times , and " you " 76 times , indicating a relatively equal distribution of first - person and second - person pronouns in his language use during the teaching process . He frequently employed the adjectives " different " ( 39 times , 0 . 29 % ) , " same " ( 5 times , 0 . 04 % ) , and " more " ( 14 times , 0 . 1 % ) , as well as adjectives like " new " ( 11 times , 0 . 08 % ) , " first " ( 8 times , 0 . 06 % ) , and " small " ( 7 times , 0 . 05 % ) . These adjectives were primarily associated with nouns related to abstract concepts such as titles , projects , time , and groups . They consistently appeared along - side George’s beat , metaphoric , and iconic gestures . The purpose 41 CSCW ’23 Companion , October 14 – 18 , 2023 , Minneapolis , MN , USA Lai Wei and Kenny K . N . Chow of using these adjectives was to externalize the lecturer’s percep - tion by employing visually comprehensible gestures to enhance the understanding of abstract content . However , this alignment between adjectives and gestures was not observed in George’s use of adverbs . Lexis like " so " ( 41 times , 0 . 3 % ) , " not " ( 36 times , 0 . 26 % ) , and " then " ( 15 times , 0 . 11 % ) frequently occurred , presumably contributing to the cohesion of sentence structure . Other adverbs like " really " ( 9 times , 0 . 07 % ) , " better " ( 2 times , 0 . 01 % ) , and " much " ( 6 times , 0 . 04 % ) were used to express emphasis and aligned with beat and cohesive gestures . The use of verbs in the teaching process was actively rele - vant with meaningful gestures . In addition to common verbs like " be / is / was / are / am / been " ( 167 times , 1 . 22 % ) , " do / doing / does " ( 36 times , 0 . 26 % ) , and " have " ( 30 times , 0 . 22 % ) , verbs like " see " ( 21 times , 0 . 15 % ) , " come " ( 8 times , 0 . 06 % ) , " put " ( 8 times , 0 . 06 % ) , and " follow " ( 9 times , 0 . 07 % ) were identified . The use of these verbs is able to visualize bodily movements and scenarios and frequently co - occurred with metaphoric and iconic gestures , revealing significant and relevant patterns . 3 . 4 Four Patterns of the Lecturer’s Part - of - speech - Lexis - Gesture Alignments Based on the typic part - of - speech - word - gesture alignments ob - served in George’s one - hour lecture ( refer to Table 2 ) , four main patterns of word - synchronized gestures were identified . The alignment between personal pronouns and deictic and beat gestures . The data indicates that George primarily used beat gestures when speaking from a first - person perspective ( e . g . , " I can create . . . " ) . Conversely , he employed numerous deictic gestures when addressing second - and third - person perspectives ( e . g . , " but you have time . . . " ) . The alignment between adjectives and metaphoric , iconic , and beat gestures . When the meaning of the adjectives pertained to space and size , which are spatial and constructive approaches ( e . g . , different , more , small , following , whole , little ) , George used metaphorical and iconic gestures . Generally , the use of adjectives prompted George to employ beat gestures . The alignment between adverbs and cohesive , beat , and iconic gestures . George seemingly used adverbs to emphasize the subject words and logical aspects of the speech context . When emphasizing , he used beat gestures ( e . g . , " even have all these pa - tients . . . " ) . Furthermore , when explaining the logic , he predominantly employed cohesive gestures ( e . g . , " . . . so it’s not just two factors . . . " ) . Additionally , he employed adverbs with spatial and constructive meanings ( e . g . , together , back ) in conjunction with metaphorical and iconic gestures . The alignment between verbs and metaphoric and beat gestures . A strong relationship was observed between speaking verbs associated with pictorial actions ( e . g . , see , follow , come , put , read , analyze , etc . ) and contextual gestures , including metaphorical and iconic gestures . For instance , George’s left - hand moves from left to right to show two separate spaces , when he said “ . . . have different titles and different ways of doing ” ( shown in Figure 1 left ) . When he mentioned “ when you put that together . . . ” , his left - hand moves toward his chest ( Figure 1 middle ) . His left hand draws a continuity circle , while he said “ I’m processing . I know what you can . . . ” ( Figure 1 right ) . 4 TOWARDS A DESIGN OF WORD - SYNCHRONIZED GESTURAL PEDAGOGICAL AGENTS The study aims to investigate the multimodal interaction of hu - man lecturers in real - life classrooms to inform thedevelopment of Embodied Pedagogical Agents ( EPAs ) with word - synchronized gestures . The findings reveal a strong correlation between lec - turers’ spoken words and specific types of gestures . When em - ploying personal pronouns , lecturers establish social connections through second - and third - person perspectives , often accompanied by spatial - oriented gestures like deictic gestures . Conversely , when providing self - related information , lecturers tend to focus on self - comprehension , leading to the use of beat gestures . These findings partially support McNeill’s concept of dual viewpoints in gestures [ 21 ] . In the use of adjectives , adverbs , and verbs , lecturers intentionally emphasize attributes to highlight speech content . Rhetoric - oriented adjectives , adverbs , and beat gestures are performed accordingly . When employing words for sentence coherence , such as " so , " " then , " " following , " and " going to , " lecturers use beat or cohesive gestures . This finding aligns with McNeill’s gesture study [ 21 ] . Additionally , contextual gestures , including metaphoric and iconic gestures , are extensively employed by lecturers when discussing speech content with spatial , constructive , and pictorial - action meanings . This re - sult is consistent with neuroscientific studies discussed in previous sections [ 5 , 14 , 32 ] . EPA designers should consider the four patterns of the lecturer’s part - of - speech - lexis - gesture alignments as a funda - mental design guideline for the development of word - synchronized gestural pedagogical agents . 5 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION Our results offer preliminary insights into the alignment between a lecturer’s meaningful gestures and words in a classroom setting . Gesture has evidenced that it obtains great potential in enhanc - ing lecturers’ self - comprehension during the teaching process and improving students’ learning outcomes [ 3 , 6 , 11 , 12 ] . Several stud - ies have explored gesture generation algorithms that demonstrate excellent accuracy and usability [ 1 , 16 , 19 , 34 ] . Our findings hold promise in bridging the previous research and providing a design guideline for creating EPAs that effectively integrate meaningful word - synchronized gestures . Implication . This study provides a foundation for the design and development of the EPAs that effectively integrate meaningful word - synchronized gestures , aiming to enhance student learning effectiveness and enrich the educational experience . a ) This empirical exploration provides insights into a lecturer’s mul - timodal interaction , the integration of verbal and visual information , in educational settings . b ) In addition to enhancing human - like behaviors , EPAs can be designed with meaningful word - synchronized gestures to enrich the multimodal information of conveying educational meaning .

This perspective on the structural aspect of language contributes to more accurate and synchronized gesture cues , creat - ing a more cohesive and meaningful interaction between EPAs and students . d ) The study highlights the importance of considering gestures in conjunction with words . It recognizes that human communication involves the integration of spoken language and gestures , and that the alignment between words and gestures holds potential for un - derstanding multimodal interactions in educational contexts . This insight opens avenues for further research in analyzing the part - of - speech of words and their corresponding gestures , contributing to a deeper understanding of lecturers’ gesture usage . Future Work . This research is ongoing , and we will continue to analyze the multimodal interaction of human lecturers and evaluate the usability of the gesture design framework through laboratory experiments . In the future development phase , we will engage lec - turers in the co - design of gestural EPAs . Ultimately , we will create EPAs with meaningful word - synchronized gestures and assess their impact on students’ learning performance and perception . Addition - ally , it is important to consider factors such as students’ perception of the lecturer’s gestures and cultural differences in human gesture use , which may influence the embodied movements of lecturers in the classroom . Therefore , further research should be conducted to explore these factors . 43 CSCW ’23 Companion , October 14 – 18 , 2023 , Minneapolis , MN , USA Lai Wei and Kenny K . N . Chow Limitation . This study is based on a case study , and the speech and gesture behaviors of individuals may influence the results , po - tentially leading to sample bias . The analysis in this study primarily focuses on four parts of speech , but other parts of speech , such as nouns and adverbs , may also interact and have an impact . In future research , a mixed - method analysis will be employed , incorporat - ing a broader range of vocabulary to offer a more comprehensive framework for gesture design . Conclusion . Our study expands on EPA design that uses a word as a unit and explores its contextual meanings to provide students with a more authentic and embodied learning experience . It differs from previous EPA studies in that we found the alignments between words and gestures and uncovered word - synchronized gestures rather than speech - rhythm - based gestures . The analysis results show the importance of EPA studies in the HCI community . REFERENCES [ 1 ] G . Ali , M . Lee , and J . - I . Hwang . 2020 .
