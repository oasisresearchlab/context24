All too often , these technologies are not oriented towards their speciﬁc modes of sense - making , but rather to - wards an outcome behaviour deﬁned by a neurotypically dominant society [ 7 ] . These technologies are then also evaluated according to the extrinsic motivations driving their design . Recently , though , more and more Participatory De - sign ( PD ) projects create technologies together with autis - tic children , albeit still mostly remaining in a medicalised view of autism . Hence , there is a lack of research into par - ticipatory design with autistic children aiming to develop technologies that reﬂect their intrinsic interests , holistic well - being and considers the embodied experiences they have with these technologies . Constructive notions of experience in the research ﬁeld of Human - Computer Interaction ( HCI ) rely on empathy as a core component of experience - driven evaluations [ 2 ] . However , autistic individuals perceive the world differently and , hence , make sense of it differently than non - autistic re - searchers [ 1 ] . This divide becomes especially pronounced when working with children , whose life worlds vastly differ from those of adult researchers . While empathy is a core requirement for the evaluation of the experience of autistic children , my work shows that researchers cannot rely solely on their empathy . Hence , evaluating these experiences re - CHI 2020 Award Talk CHI 2020 , April 25 – 30 , 2020 , Honolulu , HI , USA award05 , Page 1 quires a structured process capturing multiple views [ 6 ] . My work makes three main contributions : 1 . a concept for evaluating experiences of autistic chil - dren with technologies [ 4 ] , 2 . a participatory evaluation method tailored speciﬁcally to autistic children [ 8 ] , 3 . a discussion on the micro - ethics of conducting partici - patory research with autistic children [ 3 ] . I give a critical overview of current technologies available for autistic children and the ways of evaluating them . The concept of ‘Critical Experience’ offers a novel way for the evaluation of the experiences of autistic children with tech - nologies that are designed for their holistic well - being and enjoyment . The case studies then show how autistic chil - dren experience these technologies and which implica - tions that brings for PD processes involving autistic chil - dren [ 5 ] . I make a methodological contribution by showing how PEACE ( Participatory Evaluation with Autistic Chil - drEn ) enables researchers to evaluate these technolo - gies together with autistic children . There , the case stud - ies present unique direct insights into what matters to the children . In my discussion I further offer perspectives on the dynamics of making micro - ethical judgments when working with marginalised children more generally . Not only researchers working with users who have very different life worlds , but also a community of developers and designers of assistive technologies in general are the audience for this work . This thesis argues the case for a considerate and critically informed approach when working with marginalised user groups and shows how this can be accomplished successfully .

Before that , they were part of the Social Play Technologies and OutsideTheBox projects at TU Wien ( Vienna University of Technology ) . There , they investigated the experiences of autistic chil - dren in technological contexts , moving away from empathy and developed a concept for participatory evaluation as part of a PhD . Both their bachelor degrees in Media Culture ( BA ) CHI 2020 Award Talk CHI 2020 , April 25 – 30 , 2020 , Honolulu , HI , USA award05 , Page 2 and Media Systems ( BSc ) as well as their master’s degree in computer science and media ( MSc ) , Katta has acquired at Bauhaus Universität Weimar . Their research agenda is centred around the critical participatory design and evalu - ation of playful technologies with a focus on marginalised people , speciﬁcally around notions of gender and disabil - ity . They are also enthusiastic about service work and have previously held elected political positions such as city coun - cil member of Weimar . Acknowledgements As the thesis stems from participatory research , the chil - dren who were part of the OutsideTheBox project are at the core of this work . Each one of them showed me a new perspective on technologies and experiences , but also chal - lenged me in being attentive and continuously re - evaluating and confronting my assumptions about them and about the knowledge we co - created . I also have to thank my incredible trio of supervisors , Chris Frauenberger , Geraldine Fitzpatrick and Eva Hornecker . They were the perfect mix of extraordinary kindness , nudg - ing guidance and always , always , honest feedback . Further , I am thankful for the rest of my committee , Hannes Kauf - mann for heading it and Sarah Parsons and Jen Mankoff for providing invaluable feedback that strengthened the work in its background as well as epistemological reﬂection . Finally , thank you , David , for aggressively reminding me that there are things more important than academia and that sometimes these things are ﬁsh . REFERENCES [ 1 ] Hanne De Jaegher . 2013 .
