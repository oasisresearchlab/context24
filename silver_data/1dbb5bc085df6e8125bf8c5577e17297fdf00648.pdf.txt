172 VOLUME 23 NUMBER 2 FEBRUARY 2016 nature structural & molecular biology a r t i c l e s Integrins are heterodimeric transmembrane receptors composed of an α and a β subunit . They mediate cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix and link it to the cellular cytoskeleton and signaling apparatus . Integrins regulate many physiological events , such as cell motility , cell survival , migration , proliferation and gene expression 1 . In mammals , 24 different integrin heterodimers are expressed in a cell type – and tissue - specific manner , in which each heterodimer fulfills a specific biological role 2 . The majority of matrix - binding integrins are com - posed of an α subunit paired with the common β 1 subunit , thus giving rise to a total of 12 integrin receptors . These bind to a repertoire of ligands and exhibit a certain degree of overlap in terms of binding specificity 3 . However , the signaling pathways activated by specific integrin heterodimers are distinct even when they are triggered by the same extracellular ligands . Thus , within subsets of integrins with overlapping ligand binding specificity , each receptor fulfills a distinct biological function . Integrin signaling occurs via the short , unstruc - tured integrin cytoplasmic domains , and signaling specificity has been assigned to the α - subunit cytoplasmic domains . This is exemplified by the observations that swapping the α cytoplasmic domains in integrins is sufficient to switch the intracellular signaling pathway triggered by the receptor , irrespective of the extracellular - matrix ligand engaged 4 and that integrin - mediated adhesion to collagen via distinct α sub - units triggers either attenuation of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling or activation of a MAP kinase signaling cascade 5 , 6 , on the basis of distinct protein - protein interactions at the α cytoplasmic domain . Integrins are constantly endocytosed and recycled back to the plasma membrane ( PM ) through multiple routes 7 . Tight regulation of integrin turnover from the cell surface is essential to a number of biological processes , including cell migration and cytokinesis 8 , 9 , and has been implicated in cancer cell invasion and metastasis 10 . Integrins are predominantly endocytosed via clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) , and this process is governed by the intracellular domains of both α and β subunits . On the α subunit , binding of the small GTPase Rab21 and p120RasGAP ( RASA1 ) to the conserved membrane - proximal GFFKR sequence , shared by all α subunits , regulates endocytosis and recycling of the receptor , respectively 11 , 12 . Conversely , monomeric clathrin adaptor components Dab2 and ARH associate with conserved segments shared by all β - integrin subunits and have been impli - cated in integrin endocytosis , whereas binding of the small GTPase Rab25 to β subunits regulates recycling in invasive protrusions 13 . Thus , substantial advances have been made in understanding of the mechanisms regulating integrin traffic . Nevertheless , the existence of regulatory pathways that would trigger preferential internalization of one integrin heterodimer over another was unknown . Should they exist , such mechanisms would explain how cells rapidly and efficiently respond to the changing extracellular environment and orchestrate complex biological processes such as cell migration . Therefore , we sought to identify a mechanism that allows cells to specifically regu - late the traffic of a specific subset of integrins , which is one of the major outstanding issues in the field of integrin traffic . The assembly polypeptide 2 ( AP2 ) complex is a central player in CME and controls both the formation of clathrin - coated pits ( CCPs ) and the recruitment of endocytic cargo . AP2 recruitment of receptors is mediated by the µ 2 and σ 2 subunits of the complex .

They control a range of cell functions in a matrix - and ligand - specific manner . Integrins can be internalized by clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) through b subunit – based motifs found in all integrin heterodimers . However , whether specific integrin heterodimers can be selectively endocytosed was unknown . Here , we found that a subset of a subunits contain an evolutionarily conserved and functional Yxx  motif directing integrins to selective internalization by the most abundant endocytic clathrin adaptor , AP2 . We determined the structure of the human integrin a 4 - tail motif in complex with the AP2 C - m 2 subunit and confirmed the interaction by isothermal titration calorimetry . Mutagenesis of the motif impaired selective heterodimer endocytosis and attenuated integrin - mediated cell migration . We propose that integrins evolved to enable selective integrin - receptor turnover in response to changing matrix conditions . n p g © 201 6 N a t u r e A m e r i ca , I n c .

Here , we identified a previously uncharacter - ized Yxx φ motif in a subset of integrin - α cytoplasmic domains and set out to investigate its evolutionary conservation , AP2 binding and functionality in integrin endocytosis on different matrices . RESULTS A subset of integrin a - chains carries a conserved Yxx f motif By aligning the membrane - proximal and cytoplasmic regions of all human integrin α - chains , we identified a putative Yxx φ internali - zation motif ( in which φ can be leucine , isoleucine , methionine or valine ) present in a subset of α - chains ( Fig . 1a ) . We then separated integrins with overlapping ligand specificity into motif - containing and motif - lacking subgroups ( Fig . 1b ) . The results suggested that the sequence might be important in differential integrin endocy - tosis on the same matrix . A related internalization motif , YxxG φ ( ref . 15 ) , is also present but it is embedded in the membrane and thus is not accessible to cytoplasmic interactors . Because evolution - ary conservation can define the functional importance of a specific sequence , we analyzed the evolutionary distribution of the integrin Yxx φ motif . The mechanism of endocytosis is evolutionarily ancient , and the AP2 complex is present in almost all eukaryotes 16 , whereas integrins evolved later 17 . Our results showed that , in addition to the membrane proximal GFFKR sequence , the most conserved region in all integrin α - chains , the Yxx φ motif , is highly conserved . The GFFKR motif in the α - integrin cytoplasmic domain is present in all metazoans , whereas the Yxx φ motif first emerged in Branchiostoma floridae ( Cephalochordata ) ( Fig . 1c ) , thus suggesting a later appear - ance of this motif in evolution . Interestingly , the integrin I domain , an important ligand - binding structural module present in a subset of integrin α - chains , appeared to have evolved only in Tunicata , later than the Yxx φ motif ( Fig . 1c ) . These events predate the first diver - sification of the integrins from the more primitive receptor family found in Tunicata to the full set of human - like integrin α subunits found in Clupeocephala , which belongs to a class of ray - finned fishes ( Actinopterygii ) 17 . Surprisingly , Clupeocephala shares similarities with humans in the number and types of integrin α - chains as well as in the distribution of the Yxx φ motif , with the exception of α 4 ( ITA4 ) and α E ( ITAE ) ( Supplementary Fig . 1a ) .

However , we unveiled a further element of complexity by aligning the splice variants of these integrins . These three laminin - binding integrins clustered together on the basis of sequence similarity and ligand specificity 18 . Interestingly , they all had splicing isoforms showing modulation of the intracellular domain , exhibiting isoforms both with and without the Yxx φ motif ( Supplementary Fig . 1b ) . Sequence analysis on several mammals 19 revealed that the cyto - plasmic regions of some integrins ( α M ITAM , α E ITAE , α X ITAX and α D ITAD ) exhibited clear sequence variation , but the critical residues of the Yxx φ motif were strictly conserved , similarly to the GFFKR sequence ( Supplementary Fig . 1c ) . In addition , even in lower organisms 19 , the Yxx φ motif exhibited stricter conservation compared to the C - terminal cytoplasmic domain in the α 2 ( ITA2 ) and α 4 ( ITA4 ) chains ( Supplementary Fig . 1d ) . The conservation of the GFFKR motif parallels its functional importance in integrin activation 20 and integrin traffic 8 , 10 . A similar degree of conservation of the Yxx φ sequence suggests that this motif also has a critical role in integrin function . Integrin a 2 and a 4 Yxx f motifs interact with the AP2 complex Prompted by the potential functional importance of the Yxx φ motif in the integrin α subunit , we tested whether this sequence could mediate binding of integrin α - chains to the µ subunit of the AP complex . In vitro histidine - tagged AP2 µ 2 C - terminal subdomain ( C - µ 2 ) ( Supplementary Fig . 2a ) exhibited clear binding to the α 2 wild - type ( WT ) peptide ( Fig . 1d ) . This interaction was significantly impaired upon mutation of the Y and φ residues ( α 2 AxxA ) ( Fig . 1d and Supplementary Fig . 2b , c ) or after incubation with a competing unlabeled α 2 peptide ( Supplementary Fig . 2b , c ) . ( We were unable to test the motif containing full - length biotinylated α 4 - integrin cytoplasmic peptide in this assay , owing to insolubility issues . ) Integrin peptides lacking the Yxx φ motif ( including another collagen - binding integrin α 1 ) demonstrated weaker binding to C - µ 2 ( Fig . 1d ) . We analyzed the strength of α - integrin tail – C - µ 2 interactions with isothermal titration calorimetry ( ITC ) , using an α 4 peptide ( QYKSILQE ) and a longer α 2 integrin ( WKLGFFKRKYEKMTKNP DEIDETTELSS ) . ( Solubility issues precluded the use of a comparably short α 2 peptide , as described below . ) These peptides showed clear , robust and reproducible binding to C - µ 2 with a K d of ~ 70 µ M for the α 4 peptide ( Fig . 1e ) and ~ 50 µ M for the α 2 peptide ( Supplementary Fig . 2d ) , as compared with that for an α 5 - integrin peptide ( YKLG FFKRSLPYGTAMEKAQLKPPATSDA ; Supplementary Fig . 2d ) , β 1 - integrin peptide and a control peptide of unrelated sequence , none of which showed any clearly detectable binding ( i . e . , K d > 300 µ M ) . By way of comparison , the mainly internally localized proteins with strong endocytic signals TGN38 ( DYQRLN ) , transferrin receptor ( SYTRFS ) and epidermal growth factor receptor ( FYRLMS ) had K d values for C - µ 2 of ~ 4 µ M , ~ 15 µ M and ~ 20 µ M , respectively ( primary data not shown ) . In all cases , there was a large and similar enthalpic contribution to binding of between 35 and 40 kJ / mol , as would be expected because all peptides bind through key Y and φ residues and β - augmentation backbone hydrogen bonds but differ in their entropic counterbalance , a factor that may result from different num - bers of water molecules associated with the peptides and their flex - ibility . In vivo , all full - length transmembrane proteins are embedded in a membrane , and there is hence less entropy to lose because the tails are essentially restricted to only lateral diffusion in the plane of the membrane . Therefore , although there may be a modest increase in affinity when the interaction is measured on a membrane rather than in solution , there should be a similar increase for all transmem - brane cargo proteins . However , previous liposome - based surface plasmon resonance measurements of TGN38 immobilized in phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PtdIns4 , 5P 2 ) - containing liposome membranes 21 have shown a considerable increase in the apparent affinity of a Yxx φ signal for holo AP2 , of approximately an order of magnitude , for the strongest known endocytic signal , TGN38 , owing to the co - recognition of the cargo with multiple PtdIns4 , 5P 2 molecules ( affinity for PtdIns4 , 5P 2 of ~ 5 µ M ) . In line with the in vitro data , in cells endogenous collagen receptor α 2 integrin , but not α 1 integrin or α 5 integrin , significantly associ - ated with AP2 in proximity ligation assays ( PLAs ) with antibodies specific to the AP2 subunit α - adaptin and α 2 integrin ( Fig . 1f and Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . Together , these data demonstrate that the Yxx φ motif in α 2 and α 4 integrin interacts with the AP2 µ 2 subunit . Cocrystal of C - m 2 and a 4 - integrin Yxx f peptide We solved the structure of C - µ 2 in complex with the Yxx φ motif ( QYKSILQE ) from α 4 integrin to 2 . 8 - Å resolution ( data collection and refinement in Table 1 ) . The details of the integrin - motif binding closely resembled those of previously characterized Yxx φ endocytic motifs . C - µ 2 is composed of two interlinked β - sandwich subdomains ( subdomain 1 strands 1 – 6 and 15 – 17 , and subdomain 2 strands 7 – 14 ) ( Fig . 2a ) . The peptide , for which there was good electron density for residues 2 – 7 ( Fig . 2b , c ) , formed a β - augmentation with subdomain 1 , packing next to strand β 16 and forming three backbone - to - backbone hydrogen bonds . The tyrosine and isoleucine side chains sat in com - plementary pockets primarily lined with side chains from residues on strands 1 and 16 ( Fig . 2b , c ) , and all other visible peptide residue side chains pointed into the solvent . The walls of the tyrosine side chain pocket were created by Phe174 , Lys203 , Trp421 and Arg423 , and the tyrosine of the motif formed a π - cation bond with Arg423 Table 1 Data collection and refinement statistics C - µ 2 – α 4 peptide Data collection Space group P 6 4 Cell dimensions a , b , c ( Å ) 42 . 08 , 86 . 93 , 86 . 24 α , β , γ ( ° ) 118 . 11 , 99 . 65 , 95 . 47 Resolution ( Å ) 2 . 75 ( 2 . 90 – 2 . 75 ) a R meas 0 . 078 ( 0 . 415 ) I / σ I 14 . 2 ( 3 . 7 ) CC 1 / 2 b 0 . 997 ( 0 . 776 ) Completeness ( % ) 97 . 2 ( 80 . 8 ) Redundancy 4 . 9 ( 4 . 6 ) Refinement Resolution ( Å ) 2 . 77 No . reflections 16 , 115 R work / R free 0 . 174 / 0 . 224 No . atoms Protein 2130 Water 45 B factors Protein 62 Water 48 r . m . s . deviations Bond lengths ( Å ) 0 . 019 Bond angles ( ° ) 2 . 1 Data were collected from one crystal . a Values in parentheses are for highest - resolution shell . b CC 1 / 2 , correlation coefficient between random half – data sets . n p g © 201 6 N a t u r e A m e r i ca , I n c .

The presence of this negatively charged residue and the size of the pocket would be expected to preclude the binding of a phosphorylated tyrosine residue , owing to electrostatic repulsion and steric clashing , respectively ( Supplementary Fig . 3a ) . This was indeed the case for the α 4 - integrin motif—because the tyrosine - phosphorylated peptide ( QY ( p ) KSILQE ) ( in which p indicates phosphorylation ) showed no detectable binding to C - µ 2 in ITC ( Fig . 1e ) —as well as for the TGN38 motif in its tyrosine - phosphorylated form ( D . J . O . , unpublished data ) . The inability to bind a phosphorylated motif could provide a switch to regulate integrin endocytosis , although to date no published evidence exists for tyro - sine phosphorylation at this site . The leucine side chain pocket was lined with aliphatic residues and , overall , the interaction of the α 4 integrin – C - µ 2 buried approximately 850 Å 2 of total solvent - accessible surface area , in accordance with its micromolar K d . In complexes between other proteins and juxtamembrane fragments of integrin α - chain tails , including the region of an α integrin cor - responding to that in the complex with C - µ 2 described here , integrin α - chain tails adopt either a helical 22 , 23 or a largely unstructured confor - mation 24 – 26 . According to our structure , to bind C - µ 2 the α - integrin tail must be in an extended conformation and must be accessible from the cytosol . This is in line with results from a previous study showing that a serine - phosphorylated α 4 tail , which does contain a Yxx Φ motif , adopts an extended conformation when in complex with 14 - 3 - 3 ζ ( ref . 26 ) . The serine - phosphorylated α 4 - integrin tail in this structure and the C - µ 2 – bound unphosphorylated α 4 peptide were conformationally very similar ( Fig . 2d ) , even though their respective binding partners exhibited entirely different folds . Given that the intervening x residues of the Yxx φ motif pointed away from the C - µ 2 surface into the solvent , phosphorylation of the Y + 2 serine ( Ser1011 ) in the α 4 - integrin sequence QYKSIL would probably have little effect on the affinity of the motif for AP2 ( Fig . 2e ) . In conjunction with our observation that tyrosine phosphorylation of the Yxx φ motif in the α 4 tail inhibited the interaction with C - µ 2 ( Fig . 1e ) , these data suggest that phosphor - ylation events at different sites could potentially function as integrin switches regulating endocytosis and signaling in cells . However , this possibility requires extensive further investigations in the context of the full - length integrin in cells . Yxx f motif controls integrin recruitment to CCPs CME is a major pathway for integrin endocytosis 8 , 27 , and cargo recruitment to CCPs on the PM can be visualized in live cells with expression of fluorescently tagged clathrin light chain ( CLC ) or AP2 µ ( ref . 28 ) . Through total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy , we found that endogenous α 2 was transiently recruited to AP2 µ - mCherry puncta on the ventral sides of cells ( Supplementary Fig . 3b and Supplementary Movie 1 ) . To investigate this further , we coexpressed WT or Yxx φ motif – mutated ( Supplementary Fig . 3c ) GFP - tagged α 2 and α 4 integrins with AP2 µ - mCherry in cells . We selected these two integrins for investigation because they rec - ognize different ligands and have biologically distinct functions and expression patterns . WT and AxxA mutant were expressed at similar levels on the cell surface for both α 2 and α 4 constructs ( Supplementary Fig . 3d , e ) . Interestingly , WT α 2 and α 4 integrins , but not their mutant counterparts , colocalized with AP2 µ - mCherry ( Fig . 3a ) . α 4 WT also localized to focal adhesions , whereas such a localization was limited for α 2 WT ( Fig . 3a ) . However , the α 2 AxxA mutant , compared to the WT , exhibited increased localization to focal adhesions ( Fig . 3b ) , thus suggesting that reduced integrin endocytosis could indirectly result in increased integrin localiza - tion to focal adhesions . α 2 was also markedly endosomal compared to the AxxA mutant ( Fig . 3c ) and overlapped partially with Rab5 , Rab7 and most prominently with Rab21 vesicles ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) , in line with the important role of Rab21 in integrin endo - cytosis 29 .

Integrins are endocytosed to vesicles that move along microtubules at an average velocity of 0 . 5 – 2 µ m / s ( ref . 29 ) . α 2 WT positive vesicles showed similar dynamics , with abrupt accel - erations followed by long pauses and an average speed of 0 . 9 – 4 . 6 µ m / s . In contrast , α 2 AxxA was predominantly localized to the PM ( Fig . 3c and Supplementary Movies 2 and 3 ) . In cells spreading on collagen , α 2 WT showed dynamic vesicular - tubular movements sup - portive of cell spreading ( Supplementary Movie 4 ) , whereas α 2 AxxA was present mainly in the cell periphery on the PM ( Supplementary Movie 5 ) . Together , these data show that mutagenesis of the Yxx φ motif on α 2 and α 4 integrins alters receptor dynamics on the PM . Yxx f - motif mutation impairs a 2 - and a 4 - integrin endocytosis We found that AP2 - mediated CME was important for α 2 - integrin endocytosis . The presence of specific short interfering RNA ( siRNA ) targeting AP2 ( ref . 30 ) resulted in the downregulation of the AP2 complex as a whole , as shown by α - adaptin staining ( Supplementary Fig . 5a , b ) and inhibited endocytosis of endogenous α 2 integrin sig - nificantly ( Fig . 4a ; transferrin receptor was used as a positive con - trol 7 ) . Concordantly , integrin α 2 or α 4 AxxA mutants displayed significantly impaired endocytosis when compared with the WT receptor , as detected with a well - established biotin - based endocytosis assay 7 ( Fig . 4b , c ) . The conserved Y in the motif was the most critical residue , because mutating it alone was sufficient to disrupt the motif and to inhibit α 2 endocytosis ( α 2 AxxM ) to a similar extent as the inhibition caused by the AxxA mutation ( Supplementary Fig . 5c ) . These effects were predominantly due to impaired endocytosis rather than altered integrin recycling , because inhibition of recycling with primaquine 31 did not abolish the difference between internalization of α 4 AxxA - mutant receptor and internalized α 4 WT ( Supplementary Fig . 5d ) . The inability of AP2 silencing or disruption of the motif to fully abolish integrin endocytosis is in line with the ability of α 2 integrin to be endocytosed via different pathways including AP - 2 – independent CME 11 and a Numb - dependent and Dab2 - dependent pathway from the dorsal side of cells 32 , 33 . For α 4 integrin , the inter - nalization routes remain poorly investigated . Integrin activity influ - ences the trafficking kinetics of β 1 integrins 7 . In line with this finding , collagen engagement of α 2 integrin increased endocytosis of α 2 - GFP by 40 % ± 28 % when compared to α 2 - GFP endocytosis on fibronectin ( Fig . 4d ) . Interestingly , the difference between endocytosed WT and AxxA - mutant α 2 - integrin levels remained unaltered by collagen adhe - sion , thus suggesting that the Yxx φ motif is critical especially for uptake of unengaged integrins in cells ( Fig . 4d ) . Accordingly , silencing of AP2 reduced the endocytosis of inactive α 2 β 1 heterodimer by 60 % without having a significant effect on active α 2 β 1 endocytosis ( Supplementary Fig . 5e ) . According to our data , the α 5 tail does not interact with C - µ 2 , although it contains a Yxx φ motif – like sequence ( YxxAM ) . Accordingly , we found that mutagenesis of α 5 integrin ( AxxxA mutant ) had no effect on receptor endocytosis ( Supplementary Fig . 5f ) . Together , our results indicate that C - µ 2 – mediated integrin endo - cytosis is highly selective for Yxx φ motif – containing integrins and predominantly regulates the endocytosis of inactive integrins . Introduction of Yxx f into a V integrin stimulates endocytosis To further investigate the role of the C - µ 2 – binding Yxx φ motif in integrin endocytosis , we introduced the WT ( YEKM ) or mutant motif ( AxxA ) from α 2 integrin into α V integrin , which lacks the Yxx φ motif , either by replacing four or two of the endogenous residues with the motif sequences ( Fig . 5a ) . Strikingly , introduction of the WT motif induced α V – cyan fluorescent protein ( CFP ) endocytosis significantly compared to the nonmutated α V - CFP , and insertion of the AxxA motif fully abolished α V - CFP uptake ( Fig . 5a ) . Interestingly , the gain - of - function ( GOF ) effect was even more prominent in the α V chimera , in which two instead of four α V residues were replaced ( Fig . 5a ) . Given that we did not test the affinity status of these GOF integrins , we cannot rule out the possibility that their increased endocytosis could be linked to altered activity . Together , these data demonstrate that the Yxx φ motif in integrins is functionally important for AP2 binding and integrin endocytosis . 1 . 1 1 . 4 1 . 3 1 . 2 1 . 5 α 2 W T α 2 A xx A * * * α 2 W T α 2 A xx A * α 2 W T α 2 A xx A α 4 W T α 4 A xx A 020 806040100 * * * * 120140 0 . 9 0 . 8 α 2 W T α 2 A xx A 0 20 40 60 80 1 . 0 10 µ M α 2 - i n t eg r i n fl uo r e sc en c e i n F A s ( s i gna l i n F A s / s i gna l i n cy t o s o l ) α 2 AxxA Paxillin 10 µ M α 2 WT α 2 AxxA α 4 AxxA µ 2 – adaptin µ 2 – adaptin µ 2 – adaptin µ 2 – adaptin α 4 WT α i n t eg r i n – po s i t i v e CC P s ( % ) 2 µ M % o f c e ll s w i t h end o s o m a l α 2 - G F P Merged a b c DAPI GFP Figure 3 Yxx φ motif controls integrin recruitment to CCPs .

A ll r i gh t s r ese r ve d . nature structural & molecular biology VOLUME 23 NUMBER 2 FEBRUARY 2016 177 a r t i c l e s AP2 regulates integrin endocytosis via the Yxx f motif Because the AP2 complex regulates CME both by direct cargo recruit - ment and by mediating the formation of CCPs as a whole 14 , we inves - tigated whether decreased integrin endocytosis was the result of a loss of the AP2 µ - integrin Yxx φ - motif interaction or of a general effect of AP2 depletion on CME . We generated stable cells lines expressing siRNA - resistant myc - tagged AP2 µ WT or AP2 µ F174A D176S mutant ( AP2 Mut , which is unable to bind the Yxx φ motif but is fully functional in other aspects of CME 30 ) and assessed integrin endocytosis in these cells . As previously reported 30 , endogenous AP2 was downregulated upon stable expression of exogenous AP2 µ subunits ( Supplementary Fig . 5g ) and was completely absent after siRNA silencing ( Supplementary Fig . 5h ) . Importantly , expression of the AP2 µ F174A D176S mutant failed to support α 2 WT and α 4 WT endocytosis , whereas cells expressing AP2 µ - myc WT effectively endocytosed the WT integrins ( Fig . 5b , c ) . As expected , the endo - cytosis of AxxA - mutant integrins was not supported by the expression of either AP2 µ WT or the AP2 µ F174A D176S mutant ( Fig . 5b , c ) . These data demonstrate that specific interaction between AP2 and the integrin Yxx φ motif is functionally important for the CME of α 2 and α 4 integrins . Yxx f mutagenesis impairs a 2 and a 4 integrin functions Integrin traffic has been implicated in cell spreading 29 , 34 and is funda - mentally important for efficient cell migration 27 . To assess the effect of the Yxx φ - motif mutation on cell migration , we expressed α 2 - or α 4 - GFP WT or their AxxA mutants in cells lacking both endogenous collagen receptors ( including α 2 integrin ) and α 4 integrin ( GD25 β 1A cells ) 35 , 36 , and we monitored cell migration on collagen or the α 4 integrin – specific ligand H120 ( fibronectin fragment ) .

Mutation of the Yxx φ motif in α 2 and α 4 integrins strongly influenced cell shape and motility , such that cells express - ing the mutant integrins adhered with multiple prominent adhesive protrusions ( Fig . 6a ) and were severely impaired in cell migration on collagen and on H120 ( Fig . 6b ) . Importantly , these differences in migration were not due to different cell - surface expression levels ( Supplementary Fig . 5i , j ) . In more migratory cells , we also observed the presence of retraction fibers when adhesion was mediated via the α 2 AxxA mutant on collagen I ( Supplementary Fig . 5k ) . These data are in line with a reduced ability of AxxA - mutant integrins to be endocytosed . These data suggest that integrin endocytosis is linked to cell motility , potentially via indirect effects on adhesion - site disas - sembly , as previously demonstrated 9 , 38 , and that the ability of AP2 to recruit a subset of integrins as cargo is critical for the normal function of these integrins on their specific matrix ligands . DISCUSSION Here we identified a previously uncharacterized conserved Yxx φ motif present in a subset of integrin α subunits and demonstrated its functional importance in α 2 - and α 4 - integrin endocytosis . We propose that the Yxx φ motif in the integrin superfamily is a cru - cial and ancient molecular code aimed at modulating endocytosis and possibly other trafficking events within the subcellular traffick - ing machinery . Indeed , the AP superfamily of adaptors includes at least five members mediating trafficking from different subcellular membrane compartments , and they all recognize the same motif sequence 39 . Thus , this motif may function as a regulator of integrin traffic at multiple distinct steps . Therefore , the discovery of this motif on α integrins may potentially open a new perspective into selective regulation of integrin traffic . In conjunction with the evolutionary diversification of integrins , our findings provide insight into how a mechanism occurred to fine - tune their endocytosis to be specific to only one heterodimer out of several that are expressed in the same cell types at the same time and bind to the same matrix ligand . The ability of a cell to use the Yxx φ motif to discriminate between different integrin heterodimers at the level of endocytosis is likely to be fundamentally important , because different α / β 1 - integrin heterodimers with overlapping ligand specificity have fundamentally different signaling and cytoskeleton - regulatory functions in cells 5 , 6 . Tetraspanin CD151 is an integrin - binding protein with a Yxx φ motif . Mutation of this motif , however , has no effect on the overall integrin endocytosis rate , although it decreases the rate of endocytosis of the CD151 - associated integrin 40 . Several proteins binding to the conserved GFFKR motif in the integrin α subunit have been char - acterized in the past few years 20 , 41 . Two such proteins are Rab21 and RASA1 , which bind the GFFKR motif in a mutually exclusive fashion and mediate integrin endocytosis and recycling , respectively 12 . These proteins would be in proximity to the Yxx φ motif when in complex with the integrin α - chain , and they may have synergistic or antago - nistic effects on integrin function in adhesion and traffic . Integrins undergo complex cross - talk with multiple kinases 42 , 43 . We found here that tyrosine phosphorylation of the Yxx φ motif is incompatible in vitro with C - µ 2 binding . This implies the possibility of an addi - tional level of regulation of integrin endocytosis in cells , whereby tyrosine kinases capable of phosphorylating the motif - containing integrin α - tails could regulate an endocytosis switch and potentially induce retention of a phosphorylated subset of integrins at the plasma membrane . Given that focal adhesions are hubs for active tyrosine kinases , adhesion signaling might regulate endocytosis via such a phosphorylation - dependent switch . This , however , remains to be investigated in cells . Several trafficking regulators binding to the integrin β - tail have been described 41 . Numb and Dab2 interact with the membrane - proximal NPXY motif on the integrin β subunit 44 . Interestingly , both Numb and Dab2 interact with AP2 ( refs . 45 , 46 ) . Therefore , describing the nature of these interactions in relation to AP2 binding will be a stimulating avenue to explore and will be critically important to understanding of how integrin heterodimer – specific endocytosis occurs and how it is regulated within the numerous overlapping protein - protein interactions in the adhesome .

Through the Conserved Domain Database 47 , the sequence of the transmembrane cytoplasmic region of integrin α was found to be the Pfam 48 superfamily member Integrin _ alpha pfam00357 ( InterPro entry IPR018184 ) . Initial analysis of the integrin - α cytoplasmic regions was made with the NCBI conserved - domain search , which identified 407 sequences from 77 species with the Integrin _ alpha pfam00357 signature sequence , and 12 known structures . The taxonomy of these sequences was analyzed manually . For the complete analysis , we extracted all ( 3 , 856 ) sequences from the UniProt database that belonged to the integrin α - chain family , among which there were 1 , 171 reviewed sequences , according to UniProtKB / Swiss - Prot ( the manually anno - tated and reviewed section of the UniProt Knowledgebase ( UniProtKB ) ) , and 2 , 685 unreviewed sequences , according to UniProtKB / TrEMBL . All incomplete sequences showing lack of the transmembrane cytoplasmic regions were then discarded . All the remaining sequences were analyzed , and the presence of the Yxx Φ motif was identified in every sequence by analyzing the segment immedi - ately adjacent to the GFFKR transmembrane motif . The existence of the putative I domain was identified by the subsequent analysis of every UniProtKB integrin α - chain sequence through NCBI Conserved Protein Domain analysis . Sequences potentially containing the I domains in their structure did show Von Willebrand factor type A ( vWA ; cd00198 ) domain consensus signatures , whereas those that did not showed only the existence of separate FG - GAP ( β - propeller ; smart00191 ) repeats . The taxonomy of all identified sequences was analyzed both manually and with the UniProtKB database taxonomy tools . Additional missing annota - tion was performed with the Ensemble automatic gene annotation system 49 . In Figure 1a , UniProt entry codes are P17301 , P13612 , Q13797 , P11215 , P20702 , Q13349 , P38570 , P23229 , Q13683 , P26006 , P56199 , P08648 , P20701 , P06756 , P53708 , P08514 , O75578 , Q9UKX5 .

In addition , the antibodies specific to AP2 adaptin and AP2 µ were validated in this manuscript by silencing as shown in the figures . Original images of immunoblots used in this study can be found in Supplementary Data Set 1 . Plasmids . The following plasmids were used in this study : pMWH 6 C - µ 2 ( 160 – 435 ) 50 , Myc - µ 2 ( ref . 30 ) , integrin α 2 - GFP 29 , integrin α 4 - GFP 51 , integrin α 5 - GFP 52 , dsRed - Rab7 ( ref . 53 ) , RFP - Rab5 ( ref . 53 ) , dsRed - Rab21 ( ref . 29 ) , pPS - CFP2 - α V integrin ( Addgene , 57212 ) , mCherry - Rab4a ( Addgene , 55125 ) , and mCherry - Rab11 ( Addgene , 55124 ) . Point mutations were performed with a QuikChange II Mutagenesis kit ( Agilent Technologies ) according to the manufacturer’s instruc - tions . All constructs were checked for integrity and correctness with sequencing . TIRF microscopy . For total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy ( TIRF - M ) , HeLa cells seeded onto a collagen - ( for α 2 - GFP expressing cells ) or fibronectin - ( for α 4 - GFP expressing cells ) coated glass - bottomed dish were transfected with the indicated constructs and imaged the next day through a 100× 1 . 49 - NA TIRF objective on a Nikon TE2000 ( Nikon France ) inverted microscope equipped with a QuantEM EMCCD camera ( Roper Scientific / Photometrics ) and a dual - output laser launch that included 491 - nm and 561 - nm 50 mW DPSS lasers ( Roper Scientific ) and was driven by Metamorph 7 software ( MDS Analytical Technologies ) . A DV2 beam - splitter system ( Roper Scientific / Photometrics ) mounted on the light path enabled the simultaneous acquisition of the two emission channels . A motorized device driven by Metamorph allowed the accurate positioning of the illumination light for evanescent - wave excitation . Mann - Whitney tests were used for statistical analysis . Cells and transfections . HEK293 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 1 % penicillin - streptomycin , 10 % FBS , and 1 % l - glutamine . HeLa cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 1 % penicillin - streptomycin , 10 % FBS , 1 % Na pyruvate , 2 % HEPES , 1 % nonessential amino acids and 1 % l - glutamine . Plasmid and siRNA transfections were performed with Lipofectamine 2000 ( Life Technologies ) and Hiperfect ( Qiagen ) , respectively . HEK293 cells stably expressing AP2 µ rescue constructs were obtained by selection with 250 µ g / ml of G418 ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . The MDA - 231 stable cell line was grown in DMEM sup - plemented with 10 % FBS and 0 . 5 % geneticin . The GD25 - β 1A cells are described in ref . 36 . They were grown in DMEM Glutamax supplemented with 10 % FCS and 10 µ g / ml of puromycin . Unless indicated otherwise , cell lines were from the American Type Culture Collection ( ATTC ) . All cells were routinely tested for mycoplasma and found to be mycoplasma free . FACS analysis . FACS staining was performed as described previously 54 . Briefly , transfected HEK293 or HeLa cells were detached , fixed , washed with PBS and stained with primary antibodies against α 2 integrin ( MCA2025 , Serotec , 1 : 100 ) or α 4 ( MAB16983 , Millipore , 1 : 100 ) or with secondary antibody only in control cells for 1 h . Cells were then washed with PBS and stained with AlexaFluor647 - conjugated secondary antibody ( ab150107 , Invitrogen , 1 : 400 ) . After being washed , cells were suspended in PBS , and fluorescence was analyzed with flow cytometry ( FACSCalibur , BD ) . Cell - surface integrin levels ( AlexaFluor647 signal ) were analyzed from the GFP - integrin – positive cells . Structure determination . Residues 160 – 435 of rat µ 2 ( C - µ 2 ) were purified as described previously 50 and cocrystallized with the QYKSILQE peptide from integrin α 4 by hanging - drop vapor diffusion against 2 . 2 M NaCl , 0 . 4 M NaK phosphate , 20 % ( v / v ) glycerol , 0 . 1 M MES , pH 6 . 5 , and 5 mM DTT . Crystals were of space group P 62 ( unit - cell dimensions 125 . 6 Å , 125 . 6 Å and 74 . 4 Å ) and diffracted to 2 . 8 - Å resolution . Data were collected at 100 K on a RIGAKU rotating anode and were processed and scaled as described in ref . 50 . The structure was solved by molecular replacement with PHASER and refined to final R and R free of 18 . 2 % and 23 . 2 % with sequential rounds of refinement in REFMAC and manual rebuilding . Isothermal titration calorimetry . C - µ 2 was gel filtered into 100 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 5 , 500 mM NaCl and 1 mM TCEP . Peptides were dissolved in the same buffer . Experiments were performed with a Nano ITC from TA Instruments . C - µ 2 at 100 or 300 µ M was placed in the cell at 10 °C , and peptides at concentrations from 1 to 3 mM , depending on peptide , were titrated in with 24 injections of 2 µ l with injections separated by 5 min . A buffer into protein blank was subtracted from all data , and a minimum of at least four independent runs that showed clear saturation of binding were used to calculate the mean K d of the binding reaction , its stoichiometry and the corresponding s . e . m . values . Analysis of results and final figures were carried out with the NanoAnalyze Software . Synthetic peptides and recombinant proteins . Synthetic biotinylated peptides corresponding to the cytoplasmic domains of human ITGA1 , ITGA2 WT , ITGA2 AxxA mutant , ITGA4 , ITGA5 and ITGB1 or the unlabeled competing ITGA2 WT peptide were purchased from LifeProtein . Recombinant histidine - tagged AP2 µ C - terminal subunit ( residues 158 to 435 ) used in pulldown assays was produced in Escherichia coli strain Rosetta BL21 ( DE3 ) and purified according to the manufacturer’s instructions ( BD Biosciences ) . For crystallization and ITC , the following unlabeled peptides were used : TGN38 ( DYQRLN ) , integrin α 4 ( QYKSILQE ) , phosphorylated integrin α 4 ( QpYKSILQE ) , α 2 integrin ( WKLGFFKRKYEKMTKNPDEIDETTELSS ) , α 5 - integrin peptide ( YKLGFFKRSLPYGTAMEKAQLKPPATSDA ) , trans - ferrin receptor ( SYTRFS ) , EGFR ( FYRLMS ) and unrelated control peptide ( RMSQKIRLLSE ) . Pulldown assays . For pulldown assays , equimolar amounts of biotinylated pep - tides were incubated with equal amounts of recombinant C - µ 2 in TBSt buffer plus 3 % BSA at 4 °C for 2 h . Streptavidin - Sepharose beads were added and incubated 1 h at 4 °C . After the beads were washed , the bound protein was detected by western blot analysis . In competition experiments , a ten - fold molar excess of unlabeled peptide compared to the biotinylated peptide was added . n p g © 201 6 N a t u r e A m e r i ca , I n c .

Silenced cells were plated on µ - Slide 8 - well plates ( Ibidi ) coated with collagen I ( 5 µ g / ml ) . Slides were cooled on ice , and cell - surface α 2 integrins or transferrin recep - tor were labeled either with indicated anti - α 2 and secondary AlexaFluor488 - conjugated antibodies or AlexaFluor561 - labeled transferrin , respectively , in serum - free cell culture medium . Staining medium was aspirated , washed and replaced with fresh culture medium at 37 °C . After internalization , plates were lifted on ice . The AlexaFluor488 fluorescence on the cell surface was quenched by addition of anti - AlexaFluor488 antibody as described in ref . 7 and incubation for 1 h on ice or with an acid - wash protocol , which was performed as described in ref . 55 . Cells were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde ( PFAH ) for 20 min at room temperature , and samples were imaged by confocal microscopy . For the PLA endocytosis assays , control or AP2 - silenced cells growing on 5 µ g / ml collagen were cooled on ice and labeled with integrin α 2 and inactive ( 4B4 ) or active ( 12G10 ) integrin β 1 in serum - free medium . After washing , endocytosis was permitted for 15 min at 37 °C in serum - free medium , after which the cells were transferred back to ice . Subsequently , cells were fixed and permeabilized , and the PLA reaction was carried out according to the manufacturer’s standard protocol ( Duolink , Sigma - Aldrich ) with specific secondary antibodies recognizing the anti - α 2 antibody or the anti – β 1 integrin antibody . Biotin - based endocytosis assay . Biotin - based endocytosis assays were per - formed as described previously 7 . In brief , cells transfected with the fluorescent protein – tagged integrins ( WT of mutant ) were placed on ice and washed once with ice - cold PBS , and surface proteins were then labeled with cleavable NHS - SS - biotin ( Pierce ) in PBS at 4 °C for 30 min . Labeled cells were subsequently transferred to prewarmed serum - free medium , and internalization was allowed at 37 °C for the indicated times . Remaining surface biotin was removed by MesNa cleavage at 4 °C for 30 min ; this was followed by quenching with iodoacetamide for 15 min on ice . Cells were lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation with GFP - Trap beads according to the manufacturer’s instructions ( Chromotek ) . The immunoprecipitated integrin was released from the beads by boiling in nonreducing Laemmli buffer . Internalized integrin was blotted with anti – biotin - HRP , and the total immunoprecipitated integrin was blotted with anti - GFP antibody and used for normalization . Statistical analysis . Statistical significance was analyzed with Student’s t test for normal distribution and unequal variance or Mann - Whitney test . * P < 0 . 05 ; * * P < 0 . 01 ; * * * P < 0 . 005 . No statistical method was used to predetermine sample size . 47 . Marchler - Bauer , A . et al . CDD : NCBI’s conserved domain database . Nucleic Acids Res . 43 , D222 – D226 ( 2015 ) . 48 .
