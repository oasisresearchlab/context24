Different chromosomal loci have been linked with three autosomal dominant , ‘intermediate’ types of CMT : DI - CMTA 1 , DI - CMTB 2 and DI - CMTC 3 . We reﬁned the locus associated with DI - CMTB on chromosome 19p12 – 13 . 2 to 4 . 2 Mb in three unrelated families with CMT originating from Australia , Belgium and North America . After screening candidate genes , we identiﬁed unique mutations in dynamin 2 ( DNM2 ) in all families . DNM2 belongs to the family of large GTPases and is part of the cellular fusion - ﬁssion apparatus 4 . In transiently transfected cell lines , mutations of DNM2 substantially diminish binding of DNM2 to membranes by altering the conformation of the b 3 / b 4 loop of the pleckstrin homology domain . Additionally , in the Australian and Belgian pedigrees , which carry two different mutations affecting the same amino acid , Lys558 , CMT cosegregated with neutropenia , which has not previously been associated with CMT neuropathies . CMT has historically been divided into predominantly demyelinating and predominantly axonal forms , CMT1 and CMT2 , respectively 5 . CMT1 is characterized by slow nerve conduction velocities , whereas nerve conduction velocities are at or near normal ( Z 45 m s – 1 ) in CMT2 . In some families with CMT ( designated intermediate CMT ) , however , nerve conduction velocities range from normal to 25 m s – 1 ( refs . 1 – 3 ) . We previously carried out a genome - wide linkage study in two large pedigrees with intermediate CMT , family DUK1118 ( North Amer - ican ) 6 and family CMT310 ( Australian ) 2 , 7 , and assigned the locus ( DI - CMTB ) to chromosome 19p12 – 13 . 2 . By genotyping additional geno - mic markers in family DUK1118 , we reﬁned the chromosomal region to 4 . 2 Mb between D19S586 and the SNP rs3745454 ( Fig . 1 ) . We identiﬁed an additional multigenerational family from Belgium with DI - CMTB , family CMT - 48 , in whom we found a two - point lod score of 3 . 31 ( y ¼ 0 . 00 ) at the marker D19S586 . We then excluded 15 candidate genes and predicted genes in the remaining chromosomal area ( CACNA1A , CALR , DNAJB1 , FARSLA , FLJ23447 , HSPC023 , MGC3207 , MGC10471 , NOTCH3 , PKN1 , PRKACA , RAB8A , RFX1 , RLN3 and ZSWIM4 ) by sequencing analysis . We looked for genes that shared similar domains with genes known to be involved in CMT2 , especially the recently identiﬁed gene mitofusin 2 ( MFN2 ) , which is associated with CMT2A 8 , and identiﬁed the gene dynamin 2 ( DNM2 ) . We found that all three families with DI - CMTB carried unique mutations in DNM2 that cosegregated with the CMT phenotype ( Fig . 1 ) . The mutations were not detected in 250 healthy controls of European descent ( 500 chromosomes ) . We then screened DNM2 in a sample of 30 unlinked families with CMT2 but identiﬁed no additional mutations . DNM2 , a mechanochemical protein , is ubiquitously expressed and has a role in modulating several important cellular processes , including receptor - mediated endocytosis , membrane trafﬁcking from the late endosomes and Golgi 4 , actin assembly 9 and centrosome cohesion 10 . DNM2 is expressed in the peripheral nervous system and in the spinal cord ( Supplementary Fig . 1 online ) . DNM2 has not yet been implicated in causing human disease . The North American family DUK1118 showed a 9 - bp deletion of the 3 ¢ end of exon 14 , 1652 _ 1659 + 1delATGAGGAGg ( Fig . 1c ) . This mutation is predicted to result in two alternative mRNA products : ( i ) a shift of the open reading frame leading to a premature stop codon , D550fs ; and ( ii ) disruption of the original 3 ¢ splice site and use of a newly introduced splice site with higher predicted splicing activity , producing an in - frame mRNA with predicted deletion of three amino acids , D551 _ E553del ( Figs . 1 and 2 ) .

NATURE GENETICS VOLUME 37 [ NUMBER 3 [ MARCH 2005 289 L E T T E R S © 2005 N a t u r e P ub li s h i ng G r oup h tt p : / / ww w . n a t u r e . c o m / n a t u r e g e n e t i cs mutation in affected individuals , we conﬁrmed the existence of both predicted mRNA transcripts and detected the truncated protein in a western blot ( Fig . 2 ) . The Australian family CMT310 carries a missense mutation in exon 15 , 1672A - G , resulting in the amino acid substitution K558E ( Fig . 1c ) . Analysis of family CMT48 identiﬁed a deletion of a single amino acid , K558del ( 1672 _ 1674delAAG ; Fig . 1c ) . The mutations in families CMT310 and CMT48 affect the same amino acid residue of DNM2 : Lys558 . Cosegregating with CMT , these two families show subclinically low counts of neutrophils and , in some affected individuals , few lymphocytes , erythrocytes and platelets . Affected members of family DUK1118 have normal blood cell counts , however , suggesting that neutropenia or pancytopenia is not a general feature of DI - CMTB ( Supplementary Table 1 online ) . This implies that residue Lys558 has an unknown function in maturation or survival of peripheral blood cells . Congenital neutro - penia , also known as Kostmann disease ( OMIM 202700 ) , is caused by mutations in the gene elastase 2 ( ELA2 ) on 19p13 . 3 ( ref . 11 ) , which lies about 9 Mb upstream to the most telomeric short tandem repeat marker for DI - CMTB . We excluded mutations in ELA2 as a cause of neutropenia in family CMT48 by sequencing analysis of all coding exons . All three mutations in DNM2 occur in the pleckstrin homology domain ( Fig . 1b ) . Alignment of DNM2 orthologs and human homologs ( DNM1 and DNM3 ) showed that the mutant amino acid residues in the pleckstrin homology domain are highly conserved in different species ( Fig . 1d ) . Pleckstrin homology domains are found in hundreds of proteins 4 and enable protein binding to cell membranes through phosphoinositides 12 . Structural studies of the pleckstrin homology domain of dynamin suggest that the residues affected in families with CMT are part of a speciﬁc site in the b 3 / b 4 loop that confers interaction with the acyl chain of phosphoinositides 13 , 14 . Therefore , these mutations could affect binding of DNM2 to mem - branes and disturb cellular distribution . To explore further the effect of these mutations , we transiently transfected COS7 cells ( kidney ) and Neuro - 2a cells ( neuroblastoma ) with His - tagged expression vectors that contained cDNA encoding wild - type DNM2 , DNM2 truncated by 553 amino acids ( 553X ) and DNM2 with a deletion of three amino acids in the pleckstrin homology domain ( 551 D 3 ; Supplementary Fig . 2 online ) . After 24 h , all studied cell lines had marked morphological changes . Cells expressing wild - type DNM2 showed binding to vesicular ( endosomal vesicles ) and ﬁlamentous structures ( microtubules , actin ; Fig . 3a ) , as previously reported 15 . Cells expressing the truncated construct DNM2 553X did not survive for more than 48 h . After 24 h , the few remaining cells were smaller and had severely disrupted cellular organization ( Fig . 3b ) . The latter effects are probably mediated not only by the loss of half of the pleckstrin homology domain but also by the lack of the proline - rich domain ( PRD ) at the C terminus of DNM2 ( Figs . 1b and 2b ) . The PRD enables binding to microtu - bules 16 , 17 and recruits accessory proteins that contain SH3 - binding sites to DNM2 ( ref . 18 ) . In contrast , B 60 % of COS7 cells expressing DNM2 551 D 3 showed prominent decoration of the microtubule cytoskeleton , which appeared rather disorganized ( Fig . 3c ) . Although vesicular structures were not visible in these cells after staining with antibody to His , costaining with antibody to tubulin , a marker for microtubules , indicated that the mutant DNM2 colocalized with microtubules ( Fig . 4d ) . To our knowledge , a similar cellular phenotype has not been previously reported with mutant DNM2 constructs .

In another 30 % of cells expressing DNM2 551 D 3 , the mutant protein retained partial colocalization to vesicular elements , although these were concentrated to the perinuclear region ( Figs . 3d and 5d – f ) . We speculate that these aggregates represent misfolded protein that was not able to leave the Golgi apparatus . After staining with the Golgi marker ceramide , we found that mutant DNM2 colocalized with the observed perinuclear aggregates ( Supplementary Fig . 3 online ) . Only 10 % of cells expressing DNM2 551 D 3 had a phenotype comparable to that of cells expressing wild - type DNM2 . Moreover , in our cell models , cells expressing wild - type DNM2 showed the expected colocalization of staining with antibody to His and antibody to clathrin ( Fig . 5a – c ) . In cells expressing DNM2 551 D 3 , however , this colocalization was severely reduced ( Fig . 5d – f ) . In cells expressing DNM2 553X , which were reduced in size , the clathrin signal merged partially with peri - nuclear aggregates ( Fig . 5g – i ) . These results are indicative of dysfunc - tion of the DNM2 mutants .

( b ) Three different cDNAs were predicted in silico and conﬁrmed in mRNA from an affected individual by RT - PCR and sequencing analysis . In addition to the wild - type mRNA ( WT ) , the destroyed splice site leads to a shift of the reading frame and results in a premature termination of translation ( cDNA 1 ) . Accidentally , a new splice site with high predicted activity is introduced ( orange background in cDNA 2 ) and leads to an in - frame deletion of three amino acids ( DEE ) . ( c ) A western blot with protein lysates from an unaffected control ( Unaff ) , from three different affected individuals ( Aff1 – Aff3 ) in family DUK1118 and from HeLa cells showed a 100 - kDa band in all samples and an additional 65 - kDa band in affected individuals . The size of this latter band corresponds to the expected size of the truncated protein product ( cDNA 1 ) . The 65 - kDa band showed a higher intensity than expected , given that nonsense - mediated decay should reduce the amount of preliminary truncated transcripts . One explanation could be that the DNM2 antibody showed preferential binding to the truncated protein . To exclude cross - reactive binding of the antibody to an unspeciﬁc protein target , we intentionally overloaded the control lanes with protein lysates . HeLa represents cell lysates from HeLa cell culture . a b c d e I 0 WT 551 ∆ 3 553X P e r c en t pe r pheno t y pe 20 40 60 80 100 * II III f g Figure 3 Morphology of transiently transfected cell lines .

DNM2 is attached to cell membranes and forces ‘pinching’ of newly formed clathrin - coated vesicles 19 . This function depends on the protein’s ability to assemble into tetramers and higher - order oligomers that form a - helical arrays around necks of invaginated pits 20 . The pleckstrin homology domain inﬂuences oligomerization and GTPase activity 21 . We modeled in silico the tertiary structure of the identiﬁed mutations in the pleckstrin homology domain of DNM2 and found evidence for a disturbed stereoisometry of pleckstrin homology domains after self - assembly into homotypic or heterotypic dimers ( Supplementary Fig . 4 online ) . Pleckstrin homology domains are also crucial for receptor - mediated endocytosis 22 – 24 . Therefore , receptor - mediated endocytosis could be disturbed owing to the mutations that we identiﬁed in families with CMT . Endocytosis has been measured in several studies by applying transferrin to COS7 cells 15 , 23 . We incubated COS7 and Neuro - 2a cells expressing wild - type DNM2 with biotin - conjugated transferrin and observed regular transferrin uptake and transferrin distribution ( Fig . 6a – c ) . In COS7 and Neuro - 2a cells ex - pressing DNM2 551 D 3 , however , we observed an almost complete lack of colocalization between mutant DNM2 and transferrin - containing vesicles ( Fig . 6d – f ) . A number of these cells contained less transferrin than did surrounding nontransfected cells . In three independent studies , cells expressing DNM2 551 D 3 did not have reduced survival up to 72 h after transfection , although our observations indicate that functional changes occurred . Taken together , our results show that the mutations that we identiﬁed in a circumscript area of the pleckstrin homology domain of DNM2 cause a variant of CMT neuropathy with intermediate clinical features . These mutations disturb the function of DNM2 in a cellular model . Because DNM2 is involved in a broad variety of cellular mechanisms , dissecting its intertwined functions with respect to the mechanism of action in peripheral neuropathies will be a challenge . Whether the function of DNM2 at synapses 25 , its effects on microtubule organization and clathrin - dependent endocytosis ( as shown here ) or other mechanisms lead to CMT should be the subject of future studies . DNM2 now represents the third protein mutated in CMT that contains a GTPase domain and is related to fusion or ﬁssion of cellular membranes 8 , 26 , suggesting that these pathways have an exceptional role in CMT and in neuropathies in general . METHODS Clinical studies . We previously published linkage data on the Australian family CMT310 and the North American family DUK1118 ( refs . 2 , 6 ) . We identiﬁed the Belgian family CMT48 . We isolated genomic DNA from blood samples using standard protocols . Informed consent was obtained from all family members , and the study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the participating institutions . We determined blood cell counts on freshly obtained samples from affected and unaffected individuals from all three families using an automated cell counter in accordance with standard procedures .

We carried out genotyping for micro - satellites as previously described 2 , 6 . We determined the genotypes of SNP markers either by sequencing analysis or by denaturating high - performance liquid chromatography ( Transgenomics ) . We carried out sequencing analysis on an ABI3730 in accordance with standard procedures and the manufacturer’s recommendations ( Applied Biosystems ) . We analyzed all detected mutations at least twice by sequencing in both directions and conﬁrmed them independently by denaturating high - performance liquid chromatography . Expression studies . We extracted whole mRNA from brain , spinal cord , peripheral nerve and skeletal muscle of adult mice and from MN - 1 moto - neuron cells . We ampliﬁed cDNA using a primer pair that ampliﬁed a DNM2 fragment between exons 12 and 16 . Primer sequences are available on request . We separated the products on 2 % agarose gels and then sequenced them for speciﬁcity . Human tissue was obtained from the New York Brain Bank . cDNA cloning . In family DUK1118 , we veriﬁed the three different cDNA products in mRNA extracts ( RNEasy , Qiagen ) from two affected individuals . We obtained cDNA products with RT - PCR ( Promega ) using strategically placed primers and then separated them and puriﬁed them from agarose gels . We cloned the products directly into the expression vector pcDNA3 . 1 / V5 - His - Topo ( Invitrogen ) . We veriﬁed all three constructs by direct sequencing ( Supplementary Fig . 2 online ) . Cell culture and transfection conditions . We maintained COS7 and Neuro - 2a cells in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum in a 37 1 C incubator supplemented with 5 % CO 2 . We grew cells on 22 - mm round cover glasses and transfected them with 2 m g of plasmid , using the transfection reagent Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen ) , in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations . We then incubated cells in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum for 24 , 48 or 72 h . We ﬁxed transfected cells in 4 % formaldehyde and 0 . 7 % Triton - X in phosphate buffer for 30 min and then washed them several times in Dulbecco’s phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) . We initially veriﬁed the expression and correct translation of all three constructs by western blotting ( Supplementary Fig . 2 online ) . Immunostaining and microscopy . We detected His - tagged proteins with ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate – conjugated antibody to His - tagged IgG ( 1 : 1 , 000 ; Invitrogen ) . We used mouse monoclonal antibodies to clathrin or to tubulin ( bovine ) at 1 : 1 , 000 ( Molecular Probes ) coupled to rhodamine - conjugated sheep antibodies to mouse IgG ( 1 : 1 , 000 ; Chemicon ) . We used biotin - conjugated transferrin ( Rockland ) at 0 . 1 mg ml – 1 at incubation times of 2 , 7 and 15 min at 37 1 C and visualized proteins by coupling to streptavidin - conjugated Alexa Fluor568 ( Molecular Probes ) . We applied the Golgi marker BODIPY TR ceramide ( Molecular Probes ) in accordance with the manufac - turer’s recommendations . We then washed cells in PBS , ﬁxed them as described above and mounted them in Fluoromount - G ( Electron Microscopy Science ) . We observed cells by confocal laser microscopy ( Leica model TCS SP2 ) . Western - blot analysis . We transfected COS7 cells with constructs encoding His - tagged DMN2 proteins and maintained them as described above . At the time of protein extraction , we removed the culture media and washed cells twice in ice - cold PBS . We then lysed cells in 200 m l of ice - cold lysis buffer ( Promega ) . We extracted lymphocytes from blood samples of three affected individuals and one unaffected control by applying Lympholyte ( Cedarlane Laboratories ) . We washed lymphocytes twice in PBS and lysed them in lysis buffer ( Promega ) . We boiled lysates for 10 min in lammlie buffer , subjected them to SDS - PAGE using 4 – 20 % Tris - HCl gradient gels ( BioRad ) , electroblotted them onto nitrocellulose and probed them with primary antibody to His - tagged IgG ( 1 : 2 , 000 ; Invitrogen ) or antibody to DMN2 ( 1 : 100 ; BD Biosciences ) overnight at 4 1 C in TBS - T buffer containing 5 % nonfat dried milk . We detected bound antibodies with a 1 : 5 , 000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase – coupled secondary antibody to mouse ( Upstate ) and visualized proteins using enhanced chemiluminescence ( Amersham ) and autoradiography . Molecular modeling of b 3 / b 4 loops . We used the ModLoop program 27 to model DNM2 mutants by editing the PDB ﬁle to reﬂect the mutated DNA sequences that we observed in affected individuals . To model the wild - type pleckstrin homology domain ( D48E ) , we inserted a line with estimated coordinates for d - carbon atom into both chains after the g - carbon ( atom 321 CG ) . We altered labels as necessary ( e . g . , we replaced Asp with Glu and replaced the d - oxygens with e - oxygens ) . We converted a copy to a PDB ﬁle for input into ModLoop . We determined range parameters for loop optimization empirically . Similarly , we edited four copies of the wild - type text ﬁle to create each of the four mutants and converted these to PDB ﬁles for input into ModLoop . The results were viewed in RasMol .
