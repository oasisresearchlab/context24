THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SULFHYDRYL GROUPS AND THE ACTIVATION OF MYOSIN ADENOSINETRIPHOSPHATASE * BY W . WAYNE KIELLEY AND LOUISE B . BRADLEY ( From the Laboratory of Cellular Physiology , National Heart Institute , National Institutes of Health , Department of Health , Education , and Welfare , Bethesda , Maryland ) ( Received for publication , May 27 , 1955 ) Greenstein and Edsall ( 1 ) in early observations on the quantitative esti - mation of sulfhydryl groups in the muscle protein myosin classified the SH groups of the native protein into “free” and unavailable groups on the basis of porphyrindine titration with nitroprusside as an external indicator . In subsequent experiments , Singer and Barron ( 2 ) observed that combination of the “free” groups of myosin wit . h p - chloromercuribenzoate ( PCMB ) re - sulted in little alteration of the adenosinetriphosphatase ( ATPase ) activity of myosin , while addition of PCMB equal to the total SH led to complete inhibition . It has been observed by one of us ( 3 ) that low concentrations of PCMB resulted in some increase in ATPase activity and this was also observed occasionally by Polis and Meyerhof ( 4 ) . On reexamination of the influence of PCMB titration of myosin SH , we observed that a marked increase in ATPase activity occurred when ap - proximately one - half the sulfhydryl groups had been titrated , when Ca + + was employed as ATPase activator . On the other hand , only inhibition occurred when ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( EDTA ) was employed as activator ( cf . ( 5 , 6 ) for EDTA activation ) . The reaction of myosin with N - ethylmaleimide ( NEM ) gave similar results . After the work presented here was completed , two reports ( 7 , 8 ) appeared on the influence of phenylmercuric acetate and dinitrophenol on myosin ATPase . In these the authors appear to be dealing with similar phenom - ena . EXPERIMENTAL Materials and Methods Myosin - Myosin was prepared by either of two procedures . One is a slight modification of that of Tsao ( 9 ) , the other a modification of the pro - cedure of Weber and Portzehl ( 10 ) . The products obtained were indis - t , inguishable in so far as the work presented here is concerned . * A preliminary report of this work was presented at the 127th meeting of the American Chemical Society , Cincinnati , Ohio , April 2 , 1955 . 653 by gu e s t on O c t ob e r 28 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m 654 SH GROUPS AND MYOSIN ACTIVATION The only modification in the procedure of Tsno was the inclusion of 0 . 01 M EDTA in the saturated ammonium sulfate . No attempt was made to ascertain that this was essential . However , Tsao observed that his prepa - rations were rather low in ATPase activity , whereas our preparations were of consistent , ly high activity . In the modified Weber and Port’zehl pro - cedure , t , he muscle was extracted with 3 volumes of 0 . 5 M KCl , 0 . 1 M K2HPOd for 20 or 30 minutes , and then treated in the Waring blendor for $ minute . The material was then centrifuged , and the myosins A and B were precipitated from the supernatant solution by dilution with 10 vol - umes of water . The redissolved precipitate ( 0 . 5 M KCl ) was then adjusted to 0 . 28 M KC1 at pH 6 . 7 to 6 . 8 and the precipitat’e ( myosin B ) removed . The myosin A of the supernatant solution was obtained by further dilution to 0 . 04 M KCl . The latter fraction , after resolution in 0 . 5 M KCl , was then subjected to ( NH & S04 fractionation as in the first procedure . ’ This con - sisted of addition of a saturated solution of ( NH & S04 ( adjusted to pH 6 . 5 to 7 . 0 and containing 0 . 01 M EDTA ) to the myosin solution to 40 per cent saturation . The precipitate formed was removed and discarded . The supernatant solution was then brought to 50 per cent saturation by further addition of the ( NH & S04 solution . The precipitate was collected by cen - trifugat’ion , redissolved in 0 . 5 M KCl , and dialyzed against 0 . 5 M KC1 over - night . Protein was estimated from micro - Kjeldahl nitrogen determina - tions with correction for NHd + remaining after dialysis . Adenosine triphosphate was obtained commercially as the crystalline sodium salt . Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( EDTA ) was obtained commercially and used as the potassium salt ( pH 7 . 0 ) . The method of Whitmore and Woodward ( 11 ) was used to prepare PCMB or to purify the material obtained commercially . NEM was obtained commercially and purified by sublimation . ATPase Activity - Enzymatic activity was measured in a system con - taining 0 . 001 M ATP , 0 . 02 M histidine ( pH 7 . 6 ) , either 0 . 005 M CaClz or 0 . 001 M EDTA , and either 0 . 05 M KC1 ( when CaClz is present ) or 0 . 4 M KC1 ( when EDTA is present ) . Treatment of Myosin with SulTfhydryl Reagents . PCMB - PCMB was added to myosin dissolved in 0 . 5 M KC1 in quantities indicated in Fig . 1 and Table I . The tubes containing the treated protein were kept chilled and assayed immediately by adding aliquots containing 20 to 30 y of pro - tein to the medium given above ( final volume 1 . 0 ml . ) . The spectrophotometric procedure of Boyer ( 12 ) was employed to follow the reaction of protein SH with PCMB . 1 Both myosin B and myosin A without the ( NH & SO4 fractionation exhibit a behavior identical to that described here . by gu e s t on O c t ob e r 28 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m W .

The total SH is calculated to be 0 . 11 pmole of SH per mg . of protein . Curve B presents the behavior of ATPase activity with Ca + + as activator . Titration of about one - half the groups led to about a 4 - fold increase in ac - tivity in this experiment ( between 3 - and 4 - fold generally ) with inhibition at higher concentrations of PCMB , complete inhibition corresponding to complete titration of the SH .

The inhibition by PCMB was reversed to some extent by other sulfhydryl compounds , as was indicated by Singer and Barron ( 2 ) . When assayed in the presence of Ca + + it can be seen ( Table I ) that the effect of an amount of PCMB ( 0 . 04 pmole per mg . of protein ) approaching one - half the total SH was readily reversed by @ - mercaptoethanol . How - ever , for a higher concentration of PCMB , approaching complete inhibi - tion , no reversal was observed .

The pattern of these re - sults suggests that under the conditions ( time , etc . ) removal of the mercu - rial from the protein by even the large excesses of / 3 - mercaptoethanol is in - complete and that those mercaptide groups reacting most readily with the & mercaptoethanol may be sulfhydryl groups reacting first with PCMB , In the case of Ca * activation , these latter SH groups appear to be inhibit - ing groups when free . The results of incubating myosin with NEM at pH 7 . 2 and 8 . 0 ( both at 0’ ) are shown in Fig . 2 . Tsao and Bailey ( 13 ) observed that only about 50 per cent of the sulfhydryl groups of native myosin will react with this reagent . Comparison of the results for 2 and 20 hour incubations of myo - sin with NEM at 0” indicates that the reaction is slow . It is also evident from Fig . 2 that the rate and extent of the reaction are influenced by pH . Though only a fraction of the SH groups react with NEM , comparison by gu e s t on O c t ob e r 28 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m W . W . KIELLEY AND L . B . BRADLEY 657 with PCMB indicates that a fractional reaction with either reagent may not involve the same groups and that “availability” of any particular SH group depends on the binding agent . Thus for an apparent reaction of about one - half the SH with NEM ( on the basis of reagent concentration no more than one - half could have reacted ) the same phenomenon of in - 30 . 0 cn p 25 . 0 A 3 z r 20 . 0 Lo \ z w 15 . 0 z rx CL F IO . 0 \ . - CL 5 . 0 22 a " 0 I , , , , , I I I 0 . 02 0 . 04 0 . 06 0 . 08 0 . 10 PM NEM / mg .

However , the magnitude of this increase and the influence of reagent con - centration on its development are different from that observed with PCMB . The difference in behavior relative to the SH reagent is particularly notice - able with EDTA as activator when , wit . h NEM , complete inhibition occurs when no more than one - quarter of the SH could have combined with the reagent , in contrast to the reaction of three - quarters of the SH groups with PCMB before complete inhibition occurs in EDTA activation . by gu e s t on O c t ob e r 28 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m 658 SH GROUPS AND MYOSIN ACTIVATION DISCUSSION From results with the two sulfhydryl - binding agents it appears possible to conclude that myosin possesses more than one sulfhydryl group per ac - tive center . It also appears likely that not all the SH groups are directly concerned with t , he enzymatic activity . Of the SH groups occurring at the active center one or more appear to participate in an interaction with some unidentified group , and this interaction prevents the enzyme from exhibit - , ing its potential maximal activity in the presence of Ca as activator . The behavior of the enzyme in the presence of EDTA as contrasted to that in the presence of Ca suggests that EDTA may interfere with this sulfhydryl interaction which results in suppression of activity when Ca + + or K + is present as activator . The characteristic properties of EDTA fur - ther suggest that the unidentified group interacting with the SH groups is a metal . In a recent note Friess et al . ( 14 ) have concluded that , if a metal is involved in the EDTA activation , this metal must be very firmly bound and t . hat it is not removed by treatment with EDTA . Analysis of EDTA - treated myosin leads them to suggest that this metal may be Mg . The observations presented here further suggest that the groups on the protein involved in t , his binding of metal are , at least in part , sulfhydryl groups . SUMMARY 1 . The behavior of myosin ATPase after treatment with p - chloromercuri - benzoate or N - ethylmaleimide has been studied with either Ca + + or ethyl - enediaminetetraacetic acid as activator . 2 . The ATPase activity of myosin exhibited a marked increase with Ca + + as activator when about one - half the sulfhydryl groups had been titrated with PCMB . Further titrations led to inhibition , the process being com - plete when all the SH groups had reacted . 3 . On the other hand , only inhibition was observed with EDTA as ac - tivator , the results indicating that removal of only one - half of the SH groups is required for complete inactivation when EDTA is used as acti - vator . 4 . The results with NEM were qualitatively similar . Wit , h EDTA as activator , binding of no more than one - quarter of the SH is required for complete inactivation . 5 . In attempting to reverse the effects of PCMB with p - mercaptoethanol , only the activity as measured in the presence of EDTA appeared to follow a course which is the reverse of PCMB combination , starting at any degree of PCMB combination .
