Introduction The excellent synthetic size and shape control of gold nano - particles ( Au NPs ) allows for the localized surface plasmon resonance ( LSPR ) of Au NPs to be easily ﬁ ne - tuned . Cou - pled with the ease of surface functionalization of Au NPs , the use of Au NPs is very popular in biological applications . [ 1 – 4 ] For example , the sensitivity of the LSPR to changes in the Au NPs’ immediate environment as well as the high scattering coefﬁ cient of metallic Au NPS allows them to be used as sensing and imaging probes . [ 5 – 7 ] The conversion of absorbed light into heat by Au NPs shows potential in photothermal therapy . [ 8 , 9 ] Small molecules can also be attached via var - ious means ( electrostatic , covalent , hydrophobic ) to Au NPs in order to enable applications in gene / drug delivery . [ 10 , 11 ] Tuning Cellular Response to Nanoparticles via Surface Chemistry and Aggregation Jie An Yang , Samuel E . Lohse , and Catherine J . Murphy * However , while Au NPs have the potential to revolutionize nanotechnology based biomedical applications , in order to predict their biological interactions in detail , a more holistic understanding of the particle physiochemical properties after immersion in biological media is required . In a usual in vitro cell - nanoparticle experiment , cells are ﬁ rst plated on a hard substrate such as a culture dish . The Au NPs are then dispersed in cell media , which is added as a suspension to the cells . In such a scenario , the Au NPs are often assumed to be well - dispersed . However , Au NPs are commonly observed to aggregate when introduced into a high protein , high salt environment . [ 12 ] Au NPs aggrega - tion is also observed as a function of pH and results from the presence of crosslinking species ( e . g . , divalent cations or polyelectrolytes ) in solution , which implies that NPs in cel - lular or environmental media are primarily stabilized elec - trostatically . [ 13 ] Accordingly , NP aggregation complicates in vitro studies of NP bio - interactions . For instance , in vitro uptake of aggregated Au NPs has been shown to occur at dif - ferent rates than well - dispersed Au NPs ( although the pre - cise uptake rate also depends on the initial Au NP size and the cell type ) . [ 14 , 15 ] In addition , metallic Au NPs are dense and can settle to the bottom of the culture plates over time , and such phenomena has been observed for Au NPs larger DOI : 10 . 1002 / smll . 201302835 T he aggregation of gold nanoparticles ( Au NPs ) in cell media is a common phenomenon that can inﬂ uence NP - cell interactions . Here , we control Au NP aggregation in cell media and study the impact of Au NP aggregation on human dermal ﬁ broblast ( HDF ) cells . By ﬁ rst adding Au NPs to fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) and then subsequently to a buffer , aggregation can be avoided . Aggregation of Au NPs also can be avoided by coating Au NPs with other biomolecules such as lipids . The aggregation state of the Au NPs inﬂ uences cellular toxicity and Au NP uptake : non - aggregated cationic Au NPs are four - fold less toxic to HDF cells than aggregated cationic Au NPs , and the uptake of non - aggregated anionic citrate Au NPs is three orders of magnitude less than that of aggregated citrate Au NPs . Upon uptake of Au NPs , cellular F - actin ﬁ ber formation is disrupted and actin dots are predominant . When lipid - coated Au NPs are doped with a ﬂ uorescent lipid ( F - lipid ) and incubated with HDF cells , the ﬂ uorescence from the F - lipid was found throughout the cell , showing that lipids can dissociate from the Au NP surface upon entering the cell .

KGaA , Weinheim than 90 nm in diameter as well as long gold nanorods ( Au NRs ) . [ 16 , 17 ] This poses another challenge as NP uptake by cells is directly related to NP concentration , and cells plated at the bottom or top of the culture plate will have different cellular uptake of NPs as the cells experience a different effective NP dose . [ 12 , 17 , 18 ] Even before introduction of NPs to cells , evidence points towards the formation of a protein corona around NPs when incubated with cell media or blood plasma . [ 19 , 20 ] The adsorp - tion of proteins occurs regardless of initial surface chemistry on NPs ( although surface chemistry may inﬂ uence the com - position of the corona ) . Au NPs with different initial surface charges have been shown to develop similar ζ - potentials after incubation in cell media loaded with bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) , signifying BSA adsorption . [ 21 ] The adsorption of pro - teins onto NPs is non - speciﬁ c : a plethora of proteins bind onto the NP surface when introduced into blood plasma . [ 22 ] Further analysis of the protein adsorption onto NPs showed that protein adsorption can be resolved into two layers : a hard inner corona of strongly associating proteins and a soft outer corona comprised of weakly bound , highly labile proteins in constant exchange with free proteins in solution , which ulti - mately inﬂ uences how cells “perceive” NPs . [ 23 , 24 ] While this protein corona had been shown to mitigate and reduce NP’s capabilities and functions , [ 25 ] effects from NP incubation are still felt by cells . For example , cetyltrimethylammonium bro - mide ( CTAB ) , a surfactant that is commonly used in the syn - thesis of Au NPs and is toxic to certain culture cells at 10 −7 M concentrations , [ 21 ] can lead to apparent toxicity that is actu - ally due to incomplete removal of free CTAB from the CTAB - Au NPs . [ 26 , 27 ] Au NPs can also cause cells to undergo potentially damaging morphological changes . The actin ﬁ bers of human dermal ﬁ broblasts ( HDF ) cells had been shown to be disrupted when incubated with citrate capped Au NPs . [ 28 ] The cellular uptake via endocytosis of Au NPs resulted in the enlargement of lysosomes and reduced the lysosome degra - dation capacity by increasing its pH . [ 29 ] Au NPs can also alter cellular migration , and depending on the cell type can either slow down or speed up migration . [ 16 ] To be able to analyze and study NP - cell interactions more reproducibly , it is thus crucial to have methods to 1 ) avoid the aggregation of NPs in cell media , and 2 ) understand both the acute toxicity and sub - lethal effects of NPs on cells . The Derjaguin - Landau - Verwey - Overbeek ( DLVO ) theory , which proposed that the stability of a suspension is determined by the interaction of two opposing electrostatic and van der Waals interactions , [ 30 – 32 ] suggests that aggregation of NPs can be prevented by electrostatic and / or steric repulsive forces . It thus implies that by carefully controlling the pH , ionic strength and protein concentration , it is possible to prevent NP aggregation . In order to develop a more global picture of in vitro AuNP toxicity , the impact of NPs on acute cel - lular mortality should be supplemented by studies of how cell morphology , metabolism , and gene expression change fol - lowing NP exposure . The protein corona formation on Au NPs can be embraced and used as an additional electrostatic / steric sta - bilizer to prevent the aggregation of Au NPs in cell media . Previously , Kah et al . showed that the protein corona can be exploited to trap DNA or drugs for triggered release , and the sequential addition of ﬁ rst serum protein in PBS fol - lowed by the payload resulted in smaller Au NP clusters than when added simultaneously . [ 33 ] In this paper , we show that by incubating Au NPs sequentially ﬁ rst with serum pro - teins in nanopure deionized water , and then dispersing the protein - Au NP complexes in buffer ( containing amino acids , salts and nutrients ) to make up the complete cell media , aggregation can be prevented . The cellular uptake of Au NPs as well as their toxicity was shown to be signiﬁ cantly different depending if Au NPs are aggregated or not . We also show that the use of other biomolecules such as phos - pholipids to overcoat Au NPs can prevent their aggregation in cell media . Cell viability assays were supplemented with ﬂ uorescent confocal images which showed that while cells are still viable , cell morphology may changed upon Au NP exposure . Overall , our results highlight that the aggregation of Au NPs in cell media can be prevented , and should be fac - tored in as a major component of NP - cell interaction in in vitro uptake and toxicity assays . 2 . Results Four types of 20 nm spherical Au NPs were investigated : anionic citrate - capped Au NPs , cationic poly ( allylamine hydrochloride ) ( PAH ) coated Au NPs , and two types of lipid coated Au NPs ( Scheme 1 ) . A 1 : 1 lipid mixture of 1 - palmitoyl - 2 - oleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phospho - L - serine ( anionic , POPS ) / 1 - palmitoyl - 2 - hydroxy - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine ( zwitterionic , LPC ) was used to coat Au NPs . These lipids , which we have used before , were conjugated onto Au NPs in two ways . [ 34 ] By utilizing the hydrophobic interactions of the acyl tails with octadecanethiol ( C 18 SH ) - functionalized Au NPs , a hybrid lipid layer on Au NPs with the inner leaﬂ et comprising of C 18 SH and the outer leaﬂ et comprising of lipids can be made ( HL Au NPs ) . Alternatively , by using elec - trostatic attractions between the polar headgroup of lipids with positively - charged PAH Au NPs , lipids can be coated onto PAH Au NPs ( L - PAH Au NPs ) . UV - vis spectra of these Au NPs in water showed that after lipid coating , red shifts in the plasmon peak maxima of ∼ 1 – 3 nm was seen , signifying a change in the refractive index around the Au NP after func - tionalization ( dotted spectra , Figure 1 a , b ) . Dynamic light scattering ( DLS ) data showed an increase in the hydrody - namic diameter after lipid functionalization : ∼ 6 nm for HL Au NPs and a larger increase of ∼ 128 nm for L - PAH Au NPs , possibly suggesting multilayered lipid formation on PAH Au NPs ( Table 1 ) . Upon lipid coating , the zeta potential became more negative ( – 51 . 9 ± 1 . 3 mV for HL Au NP and – 48 . 7 ± 1 . 3 mV for L - PAH Au NP ) , reﬂ ecting the presence of POPS ( negatively charged lipid ) in the lipids on Au NPs . The four types of Au NPs were incubated with cell media in the following two ways : 1 ) direct incubation with the full cell media ( 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) in buffer with amino acids , salts and nutrients ) , or 2 ) sequential addition by ﬁ rst incubating Au NPs with 20 % FBS in water , followed by the addition of 2x buffer ( containing amino acids , salts and nutrients ) in a 1 : 1 ratio ( Scheme 2 ) .

KGaA , Weinheim full papers incubation with just bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) alone , these methods mimic the complexity of the environment . When Au NPs were incubated directly in cell media , aggre - gation was observed for citrate and PAH Au NPs ( Figure 1 ) . The UV - vis plasmon band red shifted and broadened , sig - nifying the presence of larger aggregates as compared to their respective Au NP suspensions in water . Visually , a red to purple color transition of the Au NP suspension was observed . However , when ﬁ rst incubated with 20 % FBS , and subsequently added to an equal volume of 2x buffer , no aggregation was observed even after an overnight incubation . In this case , no peak broadening was observed in the UV - vis spectra and the Au NP suspensions remained red in color . Lipid coated Au NPs ( HL and L - PAH ) were stable in both methods , suggesting that the lipid layer can effectively reduce Au NP aggregation . DLS data showed increases in hydrodynamic diameter on going from water , to direct or sequential addition of cell media , for most Au NPs ( Table 1 ) . An increase in the hydro - dynamic diameter of citrate Au NPs was seen when directly added to cell media ( from 32 . 3 ± 0 . 2 nm to 83 . 2 ± 1 . 1 nm ) , but when sequentially added to cell media , only a small increase was observed ( from 32 . 3 ± 0 . 2 nm to 36 . 8 ± 0 . 3 nm ) . The diameter of PAH Au NPs increased from 34 . 7 ± 0 . 3 nm in water to 169 . 1 ± 7 . 2 nm in direct addition to cell media , but only to 66 . 8 ± 1 . 1 nm in the sequential addition method . HL Au NPs maintained their hydrodynamic diameters in all 3 types of solutions , at 38 . 4 ± 0 . 3 nm in water , 43 . 1 ± 2 . 0 nm in direct addition to cell media and 35 . 8 ± 0 . 4 nm in sequential addition . Interestingly , sequential addition of L - PAH Au NPs to cell media showed a larger hydrodynamic size increase of 315 . 0 ± 5 . 7 nm than when directly added to cell media ( 150 . 2 ± 1 . 2 nm ) .

KGaA , Weinheim the Bradford assay ( Table 1 ) . With the exception of L - PAH Au NPs , when sequentially added to cell media , citrate , PAH and HL Au NPs had similar amounts of protein adsorbed on the 20 nm Au NPs ( 47 ± 3 , 45 ± 1 and 44 ± 1 protein / NP respectively ) . Approximately twice as much protein was adsorbed onto L - PAH Au NPs ( 85 ± 2 protein / NP ) , probably due to the larger size after multilayered adsorption of lipids onto PAH Au NPs . When Au NPs were incubated directly in cell media , more variation was observed . The amount of pro - tein adsorbed per Au NP for citrate , PAH , L - PAH and HL Au NPs was 22 ± 1 , 43 ± 4 , 69 ± 4 and 36 ± 2 respectively . Au NPs from both addition methods were incubated with human dermal ﬁ broblast ( HDF ) cells to study the impact of surface chemistry and sequence of addition on cell viability . Au NPs were incubated with HDF cells for at least 24 h and the relative cell viability was quantiﬁ ed ( Figure 2 a , b ) . When Au NPs were added directly in cell media , incubation of HDF cells with citrate , L - PAH and HL Au NPs did not result in signiﬁ cant decrease of cell viability at up to 1 . 0 nM Au NP concentration . In the presence of PAH Au NPs , the relative cell viability decreased to close to 0 % at the 1 . 0 nM PAH Au NP concentration . In comparison , when Au NPs were sequentially added to cell media , relative cell viability remained high at about 100 % for citrate and HL Au NPs . These Au NP types did not signiﬁ cantly reduce HDF cells cell viability at up to 4 . 0 nM Au NP concentrations . With L - PAH Au NPs , a slight decrease in relative cell viability to ( 78 ± 27 ) % was observed at 4 . 0 nM Au NP . HDF cells incubated with PAH Au NPs after sequential addition to cell media had a relative cell viability of ( 102 ± 4 ) % at 1 . 0 nM PAH Au NP concentration ; HDF cells relative cell viability only decreases to ( 12 ± 4 ) % at 4 . 0 nM PAH Au NP concentration , four - fold the concentration as compared to PAH Au NPs in cell media . The uptake of Au NP by HDF cells was quantiﬁ ed using ICP - MS ( Figure 4 c ) . Au NP uptake by HDF cells was largest for Au NPs that had been directly added to cell media . ( 2 . 3 – 4 . 8 ) × 10 5 Au NPs were detected per HDF cell when incubated with citrate , PAH or L - PAH Au NPs . With HL Au NPs , ( 3 . 2 ± 2 . 5 ) x 10 4 Au NP were found per HDF cell . In contrast , sequential addition of Au NPs to cell media resulted in a smaller Au NP uptake by HDF cells . With cit - rate Au NPs , a signiﬁ cant decrease in uptake was observed : only ( 250 ± 130 ) Au NP / cell was detected , a thousand - fold decrease . Uptake of PAH , L - PAH and HL Au NPs by HDF cells were decreased but less drastically ; PAH and L - PAH Au NPs uptake was decreased by half to about ( 1 . 2 – 2 . 3 ) × 10 5 Au NP / cell , while with HL Au NPs , a 20 - fold decrease was observed ( ( 1 . 6 ± 0 . 3 ) × 10 3 Au NP / cell ) . While Au NPs are non - toxic to HDF cells at low concen - trations , cell morphology has been shown to be inﬂ uenced by the uptake of Au NPs . [ 28 ] In particular , actin ﬁ bers were observed to be disrupted when incubated with citrate Au NPs . [ 28 ] To further explore the effect of Au NPs on cells , HDF cells incubated with Au NPs ( 1 . 0 nM ) using both addition methods were stained for F - actin ﬁ bers using ﬂ uorescent phal - loidin and imaged using ﬂ uorescence confocal microscopy . HDF cells incubated with Au NPs using the direct method is shown in Figure 3 . Control HDF cells ( without Au NPs ) had well deﬁ ned F - actin ﬁ bers . Incubation of HDF cells with citrate Au NPs disrupted the F - actin ﬁ bers , as judged by many globular ﬂ uorescent dots within the cell . In comparison , F - actin ﬁ bers were still prominent when incubated with HL Au NPs , although some ﬂ uorescent dots can be seen , signifying that some disruption still occurred . At a 1 . 0 nM PAH Au NP concentration , HDF cells were not viable : all observed HDF cells were shrunk , lost their multipolar nature and the F - actin ﬁ bers were not clearly deﬁ ned . At the same concentration , L - PAH Au NPs did not totally disrupt F - actin ﬁ bers of HDF Table 1 .

KGaA , Weinheim full papers cells ; while the ﬁ bers can still be seen , they were not as well deﬁ ned as control cells . In contrast , incubation of HDF cells with Au NPs in using the sequential method at the same concentration disrupted F - actin ﬁ bers of HDF cells to a lesser extent for all types of Au NPs ( Figure 4 ) . The high scattering cross section of Au NPs allows them to be easily located under the reﬂ ectance mode of confocal microscopy . Large scattering was observed from HDF cells when incubated with citrate and L - PAH Au NPs , and to a lesser extent HL Au NPs , suggesting large uptake of Au NPs by HDF cells ( Figure 3 ) . In contrast , much less scattering was observed for HDF cells incubated with citrate Au NPs with sequential addition to cell media ( Figure 4 a ) . HDF cells incubated with PAH and L - PAH Au NPs showed large scat - tering from Au NPs , reﬂ ecting the large uptake of Au NPs . A critical question regarding intracellular Au NPs is if the surface chemistry is changing on entering the cell . To under - stand if the lipids are displaced from Au NPs when they are uptaken into HDF cells , the lipid layer on HL and L - PAH Au NPs were doped with a ﬂ uorescent lipid ( F - lipid ) and incu - bated with HDF cells . In the absence of Au NPs , ﬂ uorescence from the F - lipid was not detected , signifying that uptake of lipid vesicles alone by HDF cells is not favorable ( Figure 5 ) . With L - PAH Au NPs carrying F - lipid , ﬂ uorescent vesicles ( ∼ 0 . 8 μ m ) could be detected inside HDF cells . In addition , a weaker ﬂ uorescence was observed to be diffused all over the cell membrane , even after multiple washing steps . F - lipid on any of the Au NPs did not produce any ﬂ uorescence , as judged by confocal microscopy . Therefore the observation of F - lipid in HDF cells suggests that PAH Au NPs aid in the uptake of biomolecules into cells and this layer can be stripped from Au NPs after cellular entry with a 16 h incubation . Fluorescence from F - lipid was not observed when HDF cells were incu - bated with HL Au NPs . This can be due to either the lipids remained trapped on the Au NP surface or the ﬂ uorescence is too weak to be detected due to the lower uptake of HL Au NPs . 3 . Discussion A previous study have shown that the protein corona for - mation on Au NPs is dependent on the type of cell culture media and time , and that the nanoparticle - protein interac - tion can be mediated by the different components of cell media . [ 35 ] In our investigations , we have further broken down the cell media into its buffer and FBS components , such that their respective impact on Au NPs can be studied . Figure 3 .

KGaA , Weinheim The initial surface chemistry of the AuNP strongly inﬂ u - ences its tendency to aggregate in cell media . When cit - rate and PAH Au NPs were added to cell media using the sequential method , no signiﬁ cant aggregation of Au NPs was observed . The addition of FBS alone to Au NPs allowed for the complete formation of a protein corona , which potentially stabilizes Au NPs to the harsh conditions of ionic strength changes introduced by the salts added subsequently . On the other hand , while the protein corona can still form on citrate and PAH Au NPs when introduced directly to cell media , the concurrent , and possibly faster kinetics of aggregation of Au NPs due to the salts prevents complete passivation of Au NP surface before aggregation occurs . This suggests that aggregation of Au NPs in cell media is due to the exposure of Au NPs to salts prior to the formation of a well - developed protein corona . Multilayers of lipids on L - PAH Au NPs ( but not HL Au NPs ) also seem to inﬂ uence protein binding and aggregation ; DLS data showed larger increase from sequential addition com - pared to direct addition . It was observed that lipid coated Au NPs ( HL and L - PAH Au NPs ) did not aggregate when introduced directly into a high - salt cell media . These results sug - gest that biomolecules such as proteins and lipids can be used to mitigate Au NP aggregation . Based on the DLVO theory , the attractive van der Waals interaction must be counterbalanced by a potential barrier introduced by repulsive electro - static interactions from the electric double layer of NPs for them to be well dispersed in solution . [ 30 – 32 ] For NPs , this potential barrier is small and can be easily over - come by a change in the ionic strength of solution . However , unlike Au NPs , due to the shape and the non - uniform distribu - tion of charges in proteins , the electro - static interactions between proteins can have both attractive and repulsive inter - actions and cannot be fully described by DLVO theory . [ 36 ] In a high salt medium such as cell media , proteins were shown to stabilize NPs through solvation forces . [ 37 ] It is this energy penalty that increases the intermolecular repulsion and hence stabi - lizes protein and lipid coated Au NPs from aggregation . [ 38 ] Under our experimental conditions , fewer proteins adsorb onto citrate Au NPs when they are aggregated compared to when they are well - dispersed , while similar amounts of proteins adsorb onto PAH Au NPs regardless of their aggregation state . PAH Au NPs had 43 ± 4 protein / NP from direct addition to cell media ( aggregated ) and 45 ± 1 protein / NP from sequential addition to cell media ( not aggregated ) , while citrate Au NPs in direct addition ( aggregated ) had 22 ± 1 protein / NP and 47 ± 3 in sequential addition ( not aggregated ) . At equilibrium , the size and sur - face curvature of NPs may inﬂ uence the extent of protein corona formation . Given that the total surface area exposed is smaller for aggregated Au NPs than for non - aggregated Au NPs , fewer proteins would be able to adsorb on aggregated Au NPs . Interestingly , lipids did not reduce protein corona for - mation on Au NPs . In fact , even more proteins bound onto L - PAH Au NPs than the other types of Au NPs . It is possible that lipids can trap lipohilic proteins in the media . This has been shown for lipid coated Au NRs , where lipophilic ana - lytes can be trapped on the Au NR surface for enhanced detection . [ 39 ] In our study , we limited the sedimentation of Au NPs by using smaller 20 nm Au NPs . Previously , we have shown that larger 90 nm Au NPs as well as Au NRs , because of their mass , Figure 4 .

Yang et al . 1648 www . small - journal . com © 2013 Wiley - VCH Verlag GmbH & Co . KGaA , Weinheim full papers can sediment in a relatively short amount of time ( ∼ 3 . 5 h for 90 nm Au NPs and ∼ 14 . 1 h for Au NRs to fall 1 mm ) . [ 16 ] Simi - larly , using Stokes’ law , the settling velocity for 20 nm Au NPs ( assuming the Au NPs remain well - dispersed ) is 3 . 9 × 10 −3 nm / s , which translates to ∼ 7 . 1 × 10 4 h or ∼ 3000 days to fall a distance of 1 mm . Such a time frame is much longer than a typical Au NP - cell incubation study ( ∼ 1 – 2 days ) , and the effects from sedimentation should be negligible . Indeed , for the duration of our experiments ( ∼ 1 – 2 days ) , non - aggregated Au NPs were observed to remain in suspension . When aggregated ( direct addition ) citrate and PAH Au NP were added to HDF cells , more Au NPs were taken up by cells . This is not surprising , as aggregated Au NPs are heavier and settle to the bottom of the plate much faster ( where the cells are ) . The sedimented Au NPs , either on the plate surface or on HDF cells , increased the local Au NP concentration at the substrate interface , resulting in a larger cellular uptake . However , by ensuring that the Au NPs are well dispersed , a much lower Au NP uptake was observed . In fact , for well - dis - persed Au NPs , completely different trends in the relative Au NP uptake were observed . In the absence of aggregation , the uptake of the citrate Au NPs was almost negligible compared to the other AuNPs tested . The toxicity of PAH Au NPs was also found to be dramatically altered when using either aggregated ( direct addition ) or non - aggregated ( sequential addition ) samples . However , the aggregation of citrate Au NP did not affect the relative cell viability of HDF cells . Similar results have been observed in other studies and are found to be dependent on various factors such as cell type and NP surface : transferrin - coated Au NPs ( aggregated ) are non - toxic to HeLa , A549 cells and MDA - MB - 435 cells [ 14 ] while single walled carbon nano - tubes were shown to be toxic to mice only when aggregated . [ 40 ] The toxicity of cationic NPs is commonly attributed to strong interactions with cell membranes , and resulted in the disruption of mem - brane integrity . [ 41 ] In our work , the aggre - gation of cationic PAH Au NPs increased its concentration at the bottom of the dish ( where the cells are ) , and hence possibly enhanced its toxicity . Given that proteins adsorbed onto Au NPs , it is highly likely that the underlying coating layers on the Au NPs can inﬂ uence cellular response , and also implies that the protein corona is evolving as it enters the cell . A total of ( 4 . 8 ± 0 . 3 ) × 10 5 PAH Au NP / cell was found in HDF cells using the direct addition method ( aggregated PAH Au NPs , 0 . 1 nM ) , while when added sequentially ( non - aggregated PAH Au NPs , 0 . 1 nM ) , ( 2 . 3 ± 0 . 4 ) × 10 5 PAH Au NP / cell was measured . At the same dose , the uptake of PAH Au NPs was twice as much when aggregated as compared to non - aggregated . The relative cell viability of HDF cells in well - dispersed PAH Au NPs only decreases to ∼ 10 % at 4 . 0 nM , while in aggregated PAH Au NPs the relative cell viability decreases to ∼ 0 % at 1 . 0 nM , indicating that the effective toxic dosage of PAH Au NPs is four - fold higher when non - aggregated . While these results suggest that aggregated PAH Au NPs are uptaken at a higher rate and are more toxic , it is not possible to deduce correlation from causation ; the uptake of PAH Au NPs may not be linearly related to PAH Au NP concentration and toxicity can be due to either an increased uptake of PAH Au NPs or the disrup - tive process of PAH Au NP size and accumulation in HDF cells . In addition , since a fraction of ICP - MS results may be due to Au NPs on the cell surfaces that are not washed away ( in addition to internalized Au NPs ) , this fraction might be larger with aggregated PAH Au NPS , and hence cannot be correlated to toxicity . Confocal imaging showed that F - actin ﬁ bers were dis - rupted to a various extents depending on Au NP type . Com - pared to control HDF cells , incubation of all Au NPs types to HDF cells resulted in varying decrease in F - actin ﬁ ber inten - sity and thickness , with the appearance of actin dots . Similar to results reported by Pernodet et al . , incubation of citrate Au NPs to HDF cells showed F - actin ﬁ ber disruption . [ 28 ] The F - actin disruption was more obvious and pronounced with aggregated ( direct addition ) citrate and PAH Au NPs and suggest either F - actin de - polymerization or a lack of F - actin Figure 5 .

KGaA , Weinheim polymerization and formation . Since HDF cells are exposed to a higher relative concentration of Au NPs when aggre - gated , it suggests that the F - actin disruption is Au NP con - centration dependent . Indeed , when non - aggregated citrate and PAH Au NPs are used , F - actin disruption occurred to a lesser extent . The incubation of lipid Au NPs with HDF cells helped reduced but did not eliminate F - actin ﬁ bers disrup - tion , as judged by the appearance of actin dots . Since phal - loidin stains speciﬁ cally for F - actin , the actin dots observed are unlikely to be due to G - actin ( monomer ) accumulation . Increasing evidence showed that in addition to its cytoskel - etal role , actin also plays an essential role in the endocytotic process . [ 42 , 43 ] It is thus possible that the presence of actin dots in HDF cells is due to an increase in endocytotic events that occur at the cell surface due to Au NP uptake . Our interpre - tation of actin dots formation is in line with previous results , which showed that actin dots only form at the ’top’ surface of HDF cells . [ 28 ] To investigate the lability of surface ligands on Au NPs , lipid coated Au NPs were doped with F - lipid and incubated with HDF cells . It was observed that only when exposed to L - PAH Au NPs did HDF cells show ﬂ uorescence due to F - lipid . Since the lipid vesicles ( POPS / LPC / F - lipid ) was shown to not be actively taken up by HDF cells , it can be concluded that the uptake and presence of F - lipid was aided by the endocytosis of L - PAH Au NPs . The bright ﬂ uores - cence from F - lipid in HDF cells is believed to be due to 1 ) L - PAH Au NPs uptaken in extremely large quantities and 2 ) the multilayered lipid adsorption allowed for more F - lipid to be adsorbed per PAH Au NP . While bright ﬂ uorescent spots can be detected on HDF cells , probably due to endo - cytosized L - PAH Au NPs , ﬂ uorescence can also be detected throughout the cell surface . The delocalization of F - lipid from endocytotic vesicles implies that surface ligands on PAH Au NPs can be stripped from the surface . It also further implies that the underlying surface chemistry is equally important in facilitating the dissociation of the lipid layer , i . e . the electro - static interaction between the lipid layer and PAH layer can be disrupted upon entering the cell . In addition , coupled with the relative cell viability of HDF cells when incubated with L - PAH Au NPs , the data further showed that the toxicity of the underlying layer cannot be discounted . 4 . Conclusion In conclusion , we have demonstrated how the formation of the protein corona can be used as a method to prevent Au NP aggregation in cell media . We show that the surface chemistry of Au NPs and its sequence of addition to cell media can elicit differential cellular response . Even before endocytosis into HDF cells , the surface chemistry affects Au NP aggregation in cell media . However , by ﬁ rst adding Au NPs to FBS and then subsequently to the buffer , aggregation can be avoided . Aggregation of Au NPs can also be avoided by over - coating Au NPs with other biomolecules such as lipids . The aggrega - tion state of the AuNPs is shown to strongly inﬂ uence both cellular toxicity and Au NP uptake : non - aggregated PAH Au NPs are four - fold less toxic to HDF cells than aggregated PAH Au NPs and the uptake of non - aggregated citrate Au NPs is a thousand - fold less than aggregated citrate Au NPs . The aggregation state of the AuNPs can also inﬂ uence the sub - lethal toxicity of Au NPs in vitro , speciﬁ cally their effect on cell morphology . Upon uptake of Au NPs , the F - actin formation is disrupted and actin dots are predominant , pos - sibly a response to the increase in endocytotic processes . The actin ﬁ ber disruption is more pronounced when aggregated AuNPs enter the cells . The lipid layer on L - PAH Au NPs was also seen to dissociate from PAH Au NP on entering the cell . In light of our ﬁ ndings , we suggest that future experiments regarding NP - cell interaction should be carefully regulated for NP aggregation and that the literature should be perused with this in mind . 5 .

Fetal bovine serum ( lot # : A45D03D ) was obtained from Gemini Bio - products . Fluorescein phalloidin and DAPI was obtained from Invitrogen and used as suggested . Coomassie ( Bradford ) protein assay was obtained from Thermo Scientiﬁ c . Ultrapure deionized water ( 17 . 9 M Ω , Barnstead Nanopure II ) was used for all solution preparations , which was fur - ther sterile ﬁ ltered as needed . A solution of HEPES buffer ( 20 mM , pH 7 ) was prepared in ultrapure deionized water . Glassware was cleaned with aqua regia and rinsed thoroughly before use . Synthesis and Coating of Gold Nanoparticles : Au NPs ( diam - eter 20 nm ) were synthesized by the boiling citrate method as previously described with modiﬁ cations . [ 44 ] Brieﬂ y , 2 . 5 mL of 0 . 01 M HAuCl 4 ·3H 2 O was added to 97 . 5 mL of ultrapure water in a 200 mL Erlenmeyer ﬂ ask and heated to a gentle boil with stirring . An aqueous solution of sodium citrate ( 5 % w / w , 2 mL ) was added and the solution was allowed to boil for another 30 min . During this period , the color of the solution changed slowly to a deep red . Another portion of sodium citrate ( 5 % w / w , 0 . 2 mL ) was added and the solution was allowed to boil for another 20 min , following which the solution was allowed to cool slowly to room temperature while stirring . The hydrodynamic diameter measured by dynamic light scattering was 32 . 3 ± 0 . 2 nm . Poly ( allylamine hydrochloride ) ( PAH ) Au NPs were made by ﬁ rst purifying 1 mL of citrate Au NPs by centrifugation . The Au pellet was collected and resuspended in 1 mL of water . To this puriﬁ ed Au NPs pellet , 100 μ L of NaCl ( 0 . 1 M ) and 200 μ L of PAH ( 10 mg / mL ) were added simultaneously , and the solution vortexed for 10 s . The NPs were allowed to incubate overnight or longer before being puriﬁ ed by centrifugation . Lipid Coating of Gold Nanoparticles : A 1 : 1 weight ratio of POPS : LPC was used to coat Au NPs . F - lipid was doped at 10 % of small 2014 , 10 , No . 8 , 1642 – 1651 J . A . Yang et al . 1650 www . small - journal . com © 2013 Wiley - VCH Verlag GmbH & Co . KGaA , Weinheim full papers the total lipid mass . Brieﬂ y , a total of 1 mg of lipid ( 0 . 5 mg of each POPS and LPC ) in chloroform was dried under a stream of nitrogen . The lipid ﬁ lm was then further dried under vacuum for about 6 h , after which 2 mL HEPES buffer was added to give a ﬁ nal concentra - tion of 0 . 5 mg / mL . The mixture was sonicated for about 60 min to totally suspend the lipids , affording a clear colorless solution . To make lipid coated PAH ( L - PAH ) Au NPs , puriﬁ ed PAH Au NPs was added directly to the lipid mixture and mixed ( 1 pmole PAH Au NPs in 0 . 5 mg lipids ) . The mixture was allowed to incubate over - night before puriﬁ cation by centrifugation at 600 rcf for 30 min . The supernatant was again centrifuged at 3000 rcf for 20 min . For hybrid lipid coated ( HL ) Au NPs , puriﬁ ed citrate - capped NPs was ﬁ rst added to lipid mixture ( 1 pmole citrate Au NPs in 0 . 5 mg lipids ) , followed by 2 μ L C 18 SH ( 0 . 5 mg / mL ethanol ) . The mixture was mixed and incubated overnight at room temperature , then centrifuged at 4000 rcf for 25 min . Cell Media : Cell media for growth of HDF cells and Au NP studies was made in house . Regular cell media was made from high glucose Dulbecco’s Modiﬁ ed Eagle Medium ( DMEM ) con - taining 4 mM L - glutamine , 1 mM sodium pyruvate , 3 . 7 g / L sodium bicarbonate and supplemented with 10 % FBS and 1 % pen - strep . For the two steps addition of cell media , serum free 2x high glu - cose DMEM was supplemented with 8 mM L - glutamine , 2 mM sodium pyruvate and 3 . 0 g / L sodium bicarbonate . FBS was diluted to 20 % with sterile water and when needed , added to 2x DMEM in a 1 : 1 ratio . Incubation of Gold Nanoparticles in Cell Media : Au NPs were added to cell media in 2 ways . Au NPs were centrifuged , puri - ﬁ ed , pelleted and the concentration measured . For Au NPs added directly to cell media , an aliquot of Au NPs was taken and added to a 15 mL tube . Cell media was then added to the tube and pipetted up and down several times to disperse the Au NPs . For sequential addition of Au NPs to cell media , an aliquot of Au NPs was ﬁ rst added to a 15 mL tube , followed by the addition of 20 % FBS and mixed . An equal volume of buffer ( with other amino acids , salts and nutrients ) was then added to the Au NP solution and mixed thoroughly by pipetting . Bradford assay : Au NPs , after incubation with serum proteins , were centrifuged 3 times with 1x phosphate buffer saline ( PBS ) to remove excess unbound proteins . The Au NP pellet was incu - bated with 5 μ L KCN ( 1 mM ) until all the Au NP had dissolved . The protein sample was then made up to 150 μ L in 1x PBS . Samples ( 150 μ L ) were ﬁ rst added to 96 well plates , followed by 150 μ L of Bradford assay reagent and mixed well . The mixture was allowed to incubate for about 10 min before analyzing the absorbance at 590 nm using a plate reader . Standard curves were made using albumin standards in 1x PBS from 0 – 200 μ g / mL . Staining of HDF Cells for Confocal Imaging : HDF cells were plated at a density of 20 , 000 cells / dish in 35 mm MatTek dishes and allowed to grow overnight . Au NPs ( 1 nM ) were added and the cells incubated again overnight . After incubation , HDF cells were washed 2 times with 1x PBS and ﬁ xed with 4 % paraformaldehyde ( in 1x PBS ) for 30 min . HDF cells were then washed 3 times with 1x PBS with 5 min incubation each . The cells were permeabilized with 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 for 10 min and washed 3 times with 1x PBS for 5 min each . HDF cells were then incubated with 10 % goat serum ( in 1x PBS , 0 . 1 % NaN 3 ) for 1 h before washing again 3 times with 1x PBS . Fluorescein phalloidin was added and HDF cells incubated for 30 min , following a 3 times wash with 1x PBS . DAPI was then added to the cells for 10 min and washed 3 times with 1x PBS before imaging under confocal microscope . Instrumentation : A microcentrifuge ( Eppendorf model 5418 , Fisher - Thermo Electron ) was used in various steps of synthesis and puriﬁ cation as detailed above . Standard absorption spectra were taken on a Cary 500 Scan UV - vis - NIR spectrophotometer at a scan rate of 30 nm / s . Dynamic light scattering and zeta potential measurements were performed on a Brookhaven Zeta PALS instru - ment .
