Surfactant Copolymer Annealing of Chemically Permeabilized Cell Membranes Hongfeng Chen 1 & Colin McFaul 2 & Igor Titushkin 3 , 4 & Michael Cho 3 , 5 & Raphael Lee 2 , 6 , 7 Received : 30 April 2017 / Accepted : 5 December 2017 / Published online : 27 March 2018 # The Regenerative Engineering Society 2018 Abstract Structural breakdown of the cell membrane is a primary mediator in trauma - induced tissue necrosis . When membrane disruption exceeds intrinsic membrane sealing processes , biocompatible multi - block amphiphilic copolymer surfactants such as Poloxamer 188 ( P188 ) have been found to be effective in catalyze or augment sealing . Although in living cells copolymer - induced sealing of membrane defects has been detected by changes in membrane transport properties , it has not been directly imaged . In this project , we used Atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) to directly image saponin permeabilized and poloxamer - sealed plasma membranes of monolayer - cultured MDCK and 3T3 fibroblasts . AFM image analysis resulted in the density and diameter ranges for membrane indentations per 5 × 5 μ m area . For control , saponin lysed , and P188 treatment of saponin - lysed membranes , the supra - threshold indentation density was 3 . 6 ± 2 . 8 , 13 . 8 ± 6 . 7 , and 4 . 9 ± 3 . 3 / cell , respectively . These results indicated that P188 catalyzed reduc - tion in size of AFM indentations which correlated with increase cell survival . This evidence confirms that biocompatible surfactant P188 augments natural cell membrane sealing capability when intrinsic processes are incapable alone . Lay Summary and Future Studies The fundamental purpose of this study was to compare the topography of living mammalian cell membranes before and after detergent disruption using direct atomic force microscope ( AFM ) measurement membrane surface topography . Because in - creased roughness was observed , as reflected in greater depth and diameter of AFM tip indentations , the effect of Poloxamer 188 ( P188 , ~ 9 kDa ) on the membrane was investigated . P188 is a copolymer surfactant that is known to seal disrupted pure lipid bilayer membranes . We observed that P188 reduced the roughness disrupted cell membranes consistent with defect sealing . The pure hydrophilic ( 10 kDa ) neutral polyethylene glycol did not induce sealing . Future investigation will focus on optimizing the molecular design of block copolymer surfactants to maximize their mem - brane sealing efficacy . The optimal structure or membrane sealing is likely to be cell phenotype specific . Keywords Copolymer surfactant . Plasmalemma sealing . Membrane defects . Cell injury . Atomic force microscopy .

Because traumatic injury remains the prima - ry cause of disability and death of humans under 40 years old , development of treatment options is extremely important [ 1 , 2 ] . Physical trauma disrupts tissue structure , which then leads to recovery responses at the cellular , tissue , and organismal levels . The ultimate outcome is governed by the balance be - tween injury and repair . Healing subsequent to cell injury involves molecular regen - eration or repair . Because the cell membrane lipid bilayer is a supramolecular assembly of amphiphilic phospholipids stabi - lized by entropic forces , the energy required to disrupt it is less than that required to disrupt hydrogen or covalent bonds stabi - lizing proteins and other macromolecules [ 3 ] . Consequently , plasma membrane disruption is a common immediate conse - quence of tissue trauma [ 4 , 5 ] . The intrinsic highly evolved and regulated membrane repair ( i . e . , membrane sealing ) capacity of cells is a particularly important survival capability that is criti - cally important for cell survival on this planet . Body trauma can cause tissue necrosis mediated by disrupting cell membranes beyond the capability of cell mem - brane repair ( i . e . , sealing ) processes . In this condition , trauma therapies are necessary to augment membrane sealing and enhance cell survival . Amphiphilic triblock copolymer surfac - tants such as Poloxamer 188 ( P188 ) are known to catalyze the sealing of disrupted cell membranes [ 6 ] . P188 consists of a central polyoxypropylene block flanked by two polyoxy - ethylene blocks . At sub - CMC concentrations , it has been shown to seal damaged membranes of many cell types , in - cluding skeletal myocytes disrupted by electroporation , ioniz - ing irradiation or hyperthemia [ 7 – 9 ] , mechanically damaged neurons [ 10 ] , and mutant cells with defective membrane sealing proteins [ 11 , 12 ] . Poloxamer 188 can be used to seal cell membranes both in vivo and cell culture [ 11 , 13 ] . The mechanism of copolymer surfactant sealing has been studied extensively in pure bilayer lipid membrane models [ 6 , 14 ] . These studies suggest that the hydrophobic domain of P188 targets delivery of the copolymer to sites of membrane disruption then absorbs in the membrane defect . This concen - trates the copolymer leading to corralling of the edge lipids . The hydrophilic component alters the local water structure , altering local thermodynamics such that sealing of the mem - brane defect is catalyzed . Finally , as membrane sealing occurs , the copolymer is squeezed out [ 14 , 15 ] , as illustrated in Fig . 1 . In addition to physical trauma , cell membrane disruption is commonly mediated by altering the chemical structure of membrane fatty acids or detergent extraction of membrane lipids . Undulations and membrane - attached vesicles function as lipid bilayer reservoir to maintain membrane integrity and control cell plasma membrane tension [ 16 ] . In this capacity , the membrane reservoir buffers acute changes of cell mem - brane tension induced by environmental factors and plays a role in the cell membrane morphology and function . The buff - ering effect of the membrane reservoir can be measured by straining the membrane using a laser optical tweezers ( LOT ) to pull a membrane - attached dielectric bead under quasistatic strain - rate conditions while recording the force required . The maximum length that the membrane can be strained before the bead breaks away is the tether length which depends on the mechanical properties of the membrane and the surrounding water structure . The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that P188 acts to catalyze sealing of mammalian cell membrane defects created by extraction of membrane lipids into micelles . The defects can be created by using various detergents including saponin , saponins preferentially on the plasma membrane be - cause of their high - binding affinity to cholesterol [ 17 ] . In low concentrations , saponin might integrate transiently into the cell membrane to create small spontaneously sealing defects that transiently increase the permeability of the cell membrane [ 18 ] . In higher concentrations , larger stable structural defects are produced , resulting in cell death [ 13 , 19 , 20 ] . Saponin ’ s specific ability to extract lipids in cell membranes has contrib - uted to its wide use in cell research [ 18 , 21 ] . To directly observe the defects and sealing , we choose to use tapping mode Atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) that al - lows recording of the cell surface topography at a spatial res - olution down to nanometer range [ 22 , 23 ] , in physiologically relevant conditions [ 24 ] . Under cell culture conditions , mam - malian cells are typically soft which makes precise structural interpretation of the images challenging . For this investiga - tion , we used Madin - Darby Canine Kidney ( MDCK ) epithe - lial cell line and an NIH 3T3 fibroblast cell line . We use AFM and LOT to demonstrate P188 ’ s ability to reverse saponin - induced membrane defects . The membrane damage and repair were correlated with cell survival assays . Materials and Methods Materials Research - quality Poloxamer 188 ( 8800 Da , PD < 1 . 1 ) was pur - chased from Maroon Biotech Corp ( Chicago , IL ) . Polyethylene Glycol ( molecular weight 10 , 000 Da ) and octane were pur - chased from Sigma - Aldrich ( St . Louis , MO ) . Cell culture MDCK were obtained from the Karl Matlin lab , Department of Surgery at the University of Chicago . NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection ( ATCC ) ( Manassas , VA ) . Both cell lines were monolayer 2 Regen . Eng . Transl . Med . ( 2018 ) 4 : 1 – 10 cultured in Dulbecco ’ s modified Eagle ’ s medium ( DMEM ) containing L - glutamine , 10 % fetal bovine serum and 1 % pen - icillin streptomycin ( GIBCO , Carlsbad , CA , on tissue culture plastic ) . The cells were maintained in standard cell culture incubator at 37 °C with 5 % CO 2 in an air filter clean room . Plasma Membrane Permeabilization The cells were harvested with trypsin / EDTA and plated on collagen Type I - coated cover slides purchased from BD Biosciences ( Franklin Lakes , NJ ) . Collagen - coated slides were used in order to minimize the number of cells lost to detachment . When cells were in sub - confluent condition , they were treated with 0 . 01 % saponin for 15 min , washed with PBS , and incubated with 1 mg / ml P188 for 30 min . The growth medium was washed away by PBS three times . 0 . 01 % saponin was added to the Petri dish to cover the slides . After 10 min , the saponin was washed away by PBS two to three times . The cells were recovered by incubating for 30 min in a solution of 10 mg / mL of either P188 ( experimental group ) or PEG ( control ) in DMEM . Optical Viability Imaging Assay After recovery , the cells were labeled with LIVE / DEAD® Viability / Cytotoxicity Kit for mammalian cells ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) . Calcium Am ( 1 μ M for 15 minutes ) was used to label the live cells , and ethidium homodimer - 1 ( 1 μ M for 15 minutes ) was used to label the cell membrane - permeated cells . A cover slide was mounted on the glass slide for observation . An Olympus IX81 DSU confocal microscope was used to image the cells . Slidebook software V4 . 2 ( Intelligent Imaging Innovations Inc . Denver , CO ) was used to collect and analyze images . Cell Surface Topology by Atom Force Microscopy Following the various cell treatment protocols used , cells on coverslips were fixed with 2 % glutaraldehyde for 30 min , then 4 % Osmium tetroxide solution for 30 min . The membrane surface topography was recorded using tapping - mode AFM ( Novascan Technologies , Ames , IA ) mounted on an inverted microscope ( Nikon , Tokyo , Japan ) . Scanning was carried out in water using a triangular contact - mode AFM probe with soft silicone nitride cantilevers ( Veeco Co . , Santa Barbara , CA ) with a spring constant of 0 . 06 N / m . This resulted in a force of 0 . 1 – 0 . 5 nN applied to the surface . The membrane surface was scanned at 1 . 5 Hz line speed and high - proportional / integral / derivative ( PID ) feedback gain . The scan area was 5 μ m × 5 μ m and was positioned on the non - attached cell surface away from both the lateral edges and the nucleus . Membrane Tension Assay by Laser Optical Tweezers Fluorescent 0 . 5 μ m diameter polystyrene beads ( FluoSpheres , 515 nm emission , Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR ) were used as the observation target . CD 29 antibody was conjugated to the beads using the protocol provided by the manufacturer . MDCK for study were grown on coverslips in a standard cell culture dish . After 1 – 2 days incubation , cells were sub - confluent . The coverslips were removed for study . Some were treated with 0 . 01 % saponin for 10 min , washed three times in a 3 % BSA PBS solution for 15 – 20 min . Then 100 μ l of antibody - conjugated fluorescent polystyrene beads was added to the solu - tion for 15 min at room temperature . The coverslip was washed by PBS twice and mounted on a microscope slide . The laser optical tweezer system consisted of a Nd / YAG laser beam ( 1064 nm , 5 W maximum output power ) focused with an oil - immersion microscope objective ( 100x / NA 1 . 4 ) and translated in the specimen plane at a constant speed of 1 μ m / s . Fluorescent images of trapped beads were recorded with a CCD camera at a 10 - Hz frame rate . The beads were held to the cell surface for 4 s before pulling at constant speed , as in past work by Raucher [ 16 ] and Dai [ 25 ] . The tether growth was observed as the membrane tether was pulled , until the bead escaped from the trap and quick - ly returned to the original position . Cell Viability by Flow Cytometry The MDCK cells were incubated to confluent condition in 10 % serum medium in a cell culture flask . Trypsin / EDTA was used to dissociate the MDCK cells from the culture flask . Fig . 1 A conceptual illustration of copolymer surfactant absorption onto sites of lipid bilayer structural defects mediated by hydrophobic effects Regen . Eng . Transl . Med . ( 2018 ) 4 : 1 – 10 3 Growth medium with serum was added to the flask , and the cell suspension was transferred to a sterile centrifuge tube and centrifuged . After centrifugation , as much of the supernatant was removed as possible . The cells were re - suspended in me - dium without serum to a cell density of 5 × 10 5 / ml . The suspended cells were treated with 0 . 005 % saponin for 5 min . The tube was centrifuged again , and the supernatant was re - moved . The cells were re - suspended into 2 – 20 mg / ml solution of P188 or polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) in DMEM for 30 min . Calcein AM solution and ethidium homodimer - 1 stock [ LIVE / DEAD® Viability / Cytotoxicity Kit for mammalian cells ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) ] were added to each tube for 20 min to label the cells . A BD LSRII Flow Cytometer was used in this experiment . FACS - DiVa Software ( Version 6 . 1 ) was used for data collection , and Flowjo software ( Version 8 . 8 . 4 ) was used for data analysis . Only cells labeled only by calcein ( green fluorescence ) were considered viable and to have intact plasmalemma mem - branes . Cells labeled with Ethidium Homodimer , regardless of whether they also contained calcein , were considered non - vi - able . This meant that cells transiently permeabilized by exper - imental manipulation and still viable would be considered non - viable . Data Analysis Statistical comparisons were made between the uninjured con - trol and saponin - permeabilized cells , the injured and post - permeabilized polymer treated cells , and the uninjured control and polymer treated cells . In all three pairs , the Welch ’ s two - sample t test was used to evaluate differences in the mean density , mean diameter , and mean depth of topological fea - tures . Between the uninjured and injured cells , the null hy - pothesis was that the saponin injury did not increase the num - ber density , mean diameter , or mean depth of the defects . Between the injured and treated cells , the null hypothesis was that the P188 treatment did not reduce the number density , mean diameter , or mean depth of the defects . Between the uninjured and treated cells , the null hypothesis was that the two populations had the same number density , mean diameter , and mean depth of defects . Results The population doubling time of our MDCK and Swiss 3T3 fibroblast cells was approximately 20 h . Under cell culture conditions , they remained viable and proliferative over the six population - doubling levels used in this investigation . In order to avoid to losing the cell because of detachment , the cells were cultured in the collagen - coated glass cover slides . Optical Viability Imaging Nearly all cells survived the transplantation on the 22 × 22 poly - D - lysine - coated coverslips ( Fig . 2a ) . MDCK cells were permeabilized by saponin as indicated by the increase in num - ber of EH - labeled cell ( Fig . 3b ) . Cells treated with P188 alone were similar to control cells in viability ( Fig . 2c ) . P188 sealed cells after saponin treatment as indicated by a qualitative in - crease in viable cells . In contrast , PEG treatment of saponin - permeabilized cells did not restore cell viability ( Fig . 2d ) . The NIH 3T3 fibroblast cell line manifested similar results to MDCK cells . Comparison of flourescent micrographs in Fig . 3a , b reveals that most of the 3T3 fibroblasts did not survive the saponin injury protocol . In addition , the 3T3 fibro - blasts were much less adherent to collagen - coated cover slides than healthy controls . P188 - treated cells showed both good attachment and high viability ( Fig . 3c ) . PEG treatment re - stored neither viability nor attachment ( Fig . 3d ) . This result indicates that P188 repairs the cell membrane defects and helps cell survival . Analysis AFM Cell Surface Topology AFM imaging of cell surfaces in physiological aqueous media is soft enough to substantially reduce resolution of the AFM imaging . Figure 4 contains four representative images of more than 26 cells from each arm of the study . Figure 4a illustrates a typical AFM topographical image of normal MDCK cell in culture and reflects the baseline degree of roughness we ob - served . In these images , brighter area indicates positive dis - placement of the AFM cantilever . Typical cantilever displace - ments were no more than 200 nm , comparable to that seen in past AFM imaging of wet cells [ 24 ] . Cell surface topographic variations observed for control viable cells were considered to be free of structural defects and thus were used to define the normal cantilever displacement amplitude and width ranges for cells anchored to collagen - coated coverslips . AFM tip in - dentations with magnitudes greater than two standard devia - tions above the control range were classified as B supra - threshold ^ and considered to be caused by structural defects in the cell membrane . Figure 4b reveals the characteristic AFM image ob - tained for normal MDCK cells in which the media was supplemented with 1 mM P188 . Treatment with P188 along did not alter substantially the topographical fea - tures in the membrane surface ( Fig . 4b ) . After injury with 0 . 01 % saponin for 15 min , AFM images reflected substantial changes . The number density of supra - threshold displacements became significantly larger , indi - cating that the cell membrane became more fragile . We expect the larger displacements and widths reflected ac - tual membrane defects ( Fig . 4c ) . Cells permeabilized by saponin , then treated with P188 exhibited less membrane 4 Regen . Eng .

Eng . Transl . Med . ( 2018 ) 4 : 1 – 10 5 roughness which likely represents consequences of mem - brane sealing ( Fig . 4d ) . Graphical plots obtained by analyzing the AFM data over 26 MDCK cells in each treatment group , roughness increased from 3 . 6 ± 2 . 8 to 13 . 8 ± 6 . 7 ( p < 0 . 001 ) per cell in a 5 μ m × 5 μ m area ( Fig . 5 ) . For the cells that were permeabilized by saponin and then treated with P188 , the membrane surface roughness was reduced toward normal compared to saponin treatment group alone . The roughness decreased from 13 . 8 ± 6 . 7 to 4 . 9 ± 3 . 3 ( p < 0 . 001 ) , comparable to uninjured cells ( Fig . 5a ) . The average cantilever displacement wide diameter did not significantly increase ( 442 ± 279 to 486 ± 229 nm ; p = 0 . 08 ) after saponin injury . P188 treatment decreased the defect diameter to 389 ± 233 nm ( p < 0 . 001 ) , comparable to unin - jured cells . The distribution of the number of AFM amplitudes among the treatments is shown in Fig . 5b , and the spectrum of displacement widths is shown in Fig . 5c . As Figs . 4 and 5 reveal visually , P188 and PEG treatment of non - permeabilized control MDCK cells alone did alter the cell membrane topography to small but reproducible degree . Additional studies are being done to better understand this effect . Laser Optical Tweezers and Cell Tether Length Changes in mechanical quasistatic stiffness were recorded to correlate to the AFM images . In each group , more than 30 tethers from 30 different cells were pulled by laser optical tweezers . In the control group , the average tether length was 18 . 4 ± 2 . 0 μ m . P188 did not change the tether length ( Fig . 6 ) . Saponin injury significantly decreased the average cell tether length to 7 . 5 ± 2 . 0 μ m ( p < 0 . 5 ) , indicated that the modulus was increasing . As a result , the tether lengths were shorter in permeabilized membranes . Culturing the cells with PEG did not change this decrease ( 6 . 9 ± 1 . 6 μ m ) . P188 partially re - stored the tether length to 13 . 7 ± 3 . 7 μ m . This result suggests that P188 aids sealing for membrane defects and reduces membrane water content . Quantitative Cell Survival The viability of saponin - treated MDCK cells was about 70 % in P188 culture , but only about 55 % in PEG culture ( p = 2 × 10 − 5 , Fig . 7 ) . To determine if P188 membrane sealing was cell - type dependent , NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells were perme - abilized then P188 sealed under the same conditions as MDCK cells . With P188 culture , the fibroblast viability was about 45 % , but with PEG culture , the viability was only about 25 % . The viability of saponin - permeabilized P188 - treated MDCK cells viability was not P188 dose dependent in the P188 concentration range of 0 . 2 to 2 mM in DMEM culture media ( Fig . 7a . Interestingly , the addition of octane did inter - fere with the therapeutic efficacy of P188 , lowering cell via - bility from 70 to 46 % ( p = 5 . 2 × 10 − 8 , Fig . 7b ) . Poloxamer 188 had no beneficial membrane sealing effect on octane - pretreated cells . Fig . 4 AFM image of an MDCK cell membrane in a 5 μ m × 5 μ m area .

( 2018 ) 4 : 1 – 10 Discussion Although , atomic force microscopy has been used to demon - strate surfactant sealing of supported pure lipid bilayer mem - branes , this is the first reported investigation of cell membrane typography of disrupted cell membranes sealed with surfac - tant copolymers [ 23 ] . These studies demonstrate recovery to - ward normal cell membrane structure of P188 - treated sapo - nin - permeabilized cell membranes . Saponin was equally ef - fective in permeabilizing 3T3 fibroblast and MDCK cells . The addition of saponin to the cells created a significant struc - tural alteration in plasma membrane that corresponded to a sig - nificant reduction in cell viability . The rather specific targeting of saponins and its permeabilizing action on cell membranes are well documented , thought to be mediated by the interaction between saponins and the cholesterol molecules in the cell mem - brane [ 17 , 21 ] . Scanning electron microscopy of saponin - treated cells has revealed membrane defects that range in size from 100 nm to 1 μ m , consistent with the size of the membrane defects found in our study [ 26 ] . Many other methods of inducing injury to the cellular membrane have been used , including elec - troporation [ 27 , 28 ] , ionizing irradiation [ 8 ] , and hyperthernia [ 29 , 30 ] , but saponin - induced membrane permeabilization is unique in that it extracts the lipids from the membrane bilayer . In this study , the addition of P188 to injured cells catalyzes sealing of saponin defects , a rescue effect , decreasing the num - ber and the diameter of membrane defects , and restoring viabil - ity of injured cells . We were able to directly visualize by AFM the structural restoration P188 provided to disrupted mem - branes . The ability of P188 to restore the integrity of cellular Fig . 5 a Distribution of the number of defects from 26 MDCK cells .

Viability with P188 treatment was about 70 % , but only about 55 % with PEG treatment ( p < 0 . 05 ) . b 20 mM n - octane pretreatment blocks the effect of the P188 and PEG on cell viability Fig . 6 P188 and PEG have no effect on a healthy MDCK cell membrane reservoir . The average celltether length is around 18 μ m . After saponin injury , the tether length significantly decreased from 18 . 4 ± 2 . 0 to 7 . 5 ± 2 . 0 μ m . Culturing with dextran did not affect the cell tether length ( 6 . 9 ± 1 . 6 μ m , p > 0 . 05 ) , but culturing with P188 , significantly increased the cell tether length to 13 . 7± 3 . 7 μ m . * p value is smaller than 0 . 05 8 Regen . Eng . Transl . Med . ( 2018 ) 4 : 1 – 10 membranes has been demonstrated in a variety of settings , in - cluding thermal injury [ 29 , 30 ] , ionizing radiation [ 8 , 31 ] , trau - matic brain injury [ 32 ] , neuronal injury [ 33 ] , and mechanical damage [ 34 ] . The membrane - sealing effects of P188 are largely attributed to its amphiphilic nature . P188 has been observed to selectively insert into injured portions of the membrane where local lipid packing density is reduced and then is B squeezed out ^ once normal surface pressure is restored [ 15 ] . This sug - gests that the copolymer surfactant co - localizes to exposed hy - drophobic regions in a disrupted plasma membrane ( Fig . 1 ) , and the hydrophobic core of the P188 allows for the selective insertion of the molecule into the disrupted membrane . This proposed mode of surfactant sealing is supported by our studies indicating that n - octane prevented membrane - sealing ef - fects of P188 . Pretreatment of saponin - lysed cells with 20 mM n - octane reduced the cytoprotective effects of P188 on saponin - permerabilized 3T3 fibroblasts . The most plausible explanation is that n - octane absorbs into the exposed hydrophibic regions at the edge of bilayer lipid membrane defects , thus blocking the target sites that P188 can potentially repair . Cell death thus ensues since octane does not exert the membrane annealing effects that P188 does . Ongoing studies focused on understanding the effects of octane on cell membrane defects would shed light on the extent of interaction between the hydrophobic moieties , whether the interaction involves only the disrupted parts of the membrane or the entire bilayer , altering certain membrane properties . This ability to target defects in the membrane distinguishes P188 from PEG . PEG has been shown to have protective effects against myocardial reperfusion injury [ 35 ] and to hasten recov - ery from spinal cord injury in dogs [ 33 ] through a mechanism that may mediate by effects on mitochondria . However , the concentrations of PEG used in this study are substantially lower to be equivalent in molar concentration with P188 . On the other hand , P188 is capable of catalyzing the sealing of disrupted cell membranes at sub - CMC millimolar concentrations . Such low concentrations of P188 have been found to be well tolerated in humans [ 36 ] . The safety of P188 for short - term use in humans has been demonstrated for the treatment of vaso - occlusive crises in sickle cell patients [ 36 ] . The time it takes for damaged mem - branes to be sealed is short with the beneficial effect of structural recovery taking place within half an hour of adding P188 . This suggests the delivery of P188 in boluses by intravenous admin - istration may be effective with few adverse effects . Conclusion This study used AFM to directly image the effects of a widely used blood compatible amphiphilic copolymer P188 on the surface topography of normal and detergent permeabilized cell membranes . The images documented recovery of more normal membrane architecture that correlated with increased cell survival .
