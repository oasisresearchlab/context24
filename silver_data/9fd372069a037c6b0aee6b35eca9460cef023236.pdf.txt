Bc – Linear viscoelasticity Abstract . - Polymer gels have been shown to behave as viscoelastic materials but only a small amount of data is usually provided in the glass transition . In this paper , the dynamic moduli G ′ and G ′′ of polyacrylamide hydrogels are investigated using both an AFM in contact force modu - lation mode and a classical rheometer . The validity is shown by matching of the two techniques . Measurements are carried out on gels of increasing polymer concentration in a wide frequency range . A model based on fractional derivatives is successfully used , covering the whole frequency range . G 0N , the plateau modulus , as well as several other parameters are obtained at low frequen - cies . The model also predicts the slope a of both moduli in the glass transition , and a transition frequency f T is introduced to separate the gel – like behavior with the glassy state . Its variation with polymer content c gives a dependence f T ∼ c 1 . 6 , in good agreement with previous theories . Therefore the AFM data provides new information on the physics of polymer gels . Introduction . – Polymers exhibit interesting rheo - logical behavior for they can successively behave as liq - uids , elastic materials showing a rubbery plateau , then undergo a glass transition before reaching the solid domain [ 1 ] . These processes are temperature - dependent . Because of this broad range of properties , polymers are widely used in industrial applications , as well as biological processes . However , it is often diﬃcult to characterize their mate - rial properties , as the range of relevant frequencies covers several decades [ 2 , 3 ] . Techniques such as classical rheome - try , diﬀusing - wave spectroscopy ( DWS ) [ 4 ] , dynamic light scattering [ 5 ] or ultrasonic experiments have been used to describe the complex behavior of polymers each in its own range of frequencies [ 6 , 7 ] . In particular , an important way to extend the linear viscoelastic behavior ( LVE ) is to use the time – temperature superposition principle , wherein re - ( a ) E - Mail : Liviu - Iulian . Palade @ insa - lyon . fr ( b ) E - Mail : Claude . Verdier @ ujf - grenoble . fr sults obtained at various temperatures are shifted onto a reference temperature master curve [ 3 ] . These obser - vations have motivated quite a lot of theoretical studies . Diﬀerent models providing relaxation spectra have been proposed , ranging from multiple Maxwell models to con - tinuous relaxation spectra [ 2 ] , involving both liquid and glassy modes . The concept of soft glassy rheology [ 8 , 9 ] appeared recently and provides another alternative suited for many systems . Indeed it is based on the idea that sub – elements in the microstructure are linked via weak interactions , in a disordered metastable state . Based on this concept , many complex ﬂuids can be described thanks to this model , in particular packed colloidal suspensions , the cell cytoskeleton [ 10 ] as well as foams or slurries . Due to their cross - linked network , polymer gels share similar properties [ 8 ] with polymers . They can be charac - terized using microrheology techniques [ 11 , 12 ] , as applied in particular for actin networks [ 13 , 14 ] . The behavior of p - 1 Y . Abidine et al . classical gels is in fact similar in the glass transition do - main , but no modelling attempt has been made so far to characterize the entire frequency domain covered by re - cent instruments . Therefore , it is worthy to characterize various polymeric gels in a wide range of frequencies , and develop a model for the whole range . This is the main purpose of the work presented here . An AFM – based mi - crorheology method [ 15 – 18 ] will be designed to investigate a wider range of frequencies , in combination with classical rheometry . This dynamic AFM technique , used to char - acterize [ 19 ] and probe the mechanical properties locally [ 16 ] , was developped and validated up to 10 Hz for poly - mers [ 15 ] . Here , we will extend it up to 500 Hz by check - ing the overlap of the AFM and rheology data . We will choose to characterize polyacrylamide hydrogels due to their widely used mechanical properties [ 20 , 21 ] , in partic - ular in biology . These gels exhibit viscoelastic properties [ 21 ] , depending on concentration or cross – linking density . A theoretical model based on a continuous relaxation spectrum modiﬁed using fractional derivatives for the higher frequencies [ 3 ] will be used to describe the whole rheology spectrum . In the classical rheology domain [ 0 . 001 Hz − 2 Hz ] , information on the plateau modulus G 0N [ 22 ] will show an increase with a power dependence with acrylamide concentration . Other model parameters will be also discussed . Further data in the high frequency range [ 1 Hz − 500 Hz ] will allow to investigate the glass tran - sition regime ( slope a of dynamic moduli ) using AFM – microrheology . In particular , a new transition time λ T between the gel – like region and the glass regime will be introduced and compared to previous theories [ 23 , 24 ] . Experiments and modelling . – AFM and rheology measurements . Polyacrylamide gels were synthesized by mixing acrylamide ( 30 % w / w ) at four diﬀerent weight concentrations ( 5 − 7 . 5 − 10 − 15 % ) , and N , N – methylene – bisacrylamide 1 % w / w at a ﬁxed con - centration 0 . 03 % in deionized water . This means that hy - drogels were slightly crosslinked . Polymerization was then initiated by incorporating N , N , N , N - tetramethylethylene - diamine ( TEMED , Sigma ) and ammonium persulfate 10 % solution ( APS ) , as described earlier [ 20 ] . Gels of thick - ness 70 µ m were prepared on a pre – treated glass Petri dish for a better adhesion [ 20 ] . Gels were always kept in humid conditions , so that they were swollen and in equi - librium . The Petri dish containing the gel was set onto the AFM ( JPK Instruments , Berlin ) equipped with an in - verted microscope ( Zeiss , model D1 , Berlin ) . The AFM chips ( Bruker , MLCT , pyramid shape ) had 4 sharp sides with an average tip half – angle θ = 20 o . The radius of cur - vature at the tip was around 20 nm . Stiﬀness constants used were ∼ 0 . 01 N / m when mounted onto the AFM glass block and were calibrated using the thermal ﬂuctuations method . Then an initial indentation δ 0 of the sample was made under a controlled force F 0 , given by Hertz model : F 0 = 3 E tan θ 4 ( 1 − ν 2 ) δ 20 ( 1 ) where E is the Young modulus , ν the Poisson ratio ( usu - ally assumed to be close to 0 . 5 for such gels [ 25 ] ) and θ as deﬁned above . It has been shown [ 26 ] that the ef - fect of the tip curvature does not aﬀect measurements as long as the penetration depth δ 0 is large , usually higher than 300 nm . Therefore δ 0 was chosen large enough ( usu - ally around 500 nm ) allowing a suﬃcient contact area . In order to carry out microrheology measurements , a small perturbation δ ( ω ) ( frequency f from 1 Hz to 0 . 5 kHz , and ω = 2 πf is the angular frequency ) was superposed to the initial indentation . The perturbation being small , Eq . ( 1 ) can be linearized about the equilibrium . By the correspon - dence principle of LVE , in the ω – domain , one operates with complex quantities . Let δ ∗ , F ∗ be the complex in - dentation and force . Substracting the hydrodynamic drag iωb ( 0 ) [ 16 ] , the complex shear modulus G ∗ ( ω ) is given by : G ∗ ( ω ) = 1 − ν 3 δ 0 tan θ { F ∗ ( ω ) δ ∗ ( ω ) − iωb ( 0 ) } ( 2 ) where b ( h ) is a function accounting for the geometry of the tip and depends on the height h from tip to sample , and was measured [ 16 ] by extrapolation of the function at h = 0 . Checking of the data was also carried out using other MLCT cantilevers on the same chip , and the same results were obtained ( data not shown ) . Frequencies were varied from 1 Hz to 500 Hz , and signals corresponding to δ ( ω ) and F ( ω ) were recorded , showing that 500 Hz is the upper frequency limit , beyond which spurious eﬀects occur as we get close to the resonant frequency of the cantilever . As it is possible that inhomogeneous structures appear within such polymer networks ( depending on concentra - tion and crosslinker ) , AFM experiments were repeated several times . At least 16 experiments per gel were made in the frequency range . Further indentation tests were also carried out to obtain the Young modulus ( E ) from Eq . ( 1 ) . Histograms of E , G ′ and G ′′ ( at 1 Hz ) are shown ( 10 % concentration gel ) in Fig . 1 . The data show that het - erogeneities do not aﬀect the rheological measurements so much , and conﬁrms that E ∼ 3 G ′ ( at low frequencies ) , as expected for incompressible elastic materials ( ν ∼ 0 . 5 ) . Fig . 1 : Histograms showing the 10 % gel rheological properties : elastic modulus ( E ) and dynamic moduli G ′ and G ′′ at 1 Hz . E = 7111 Pa ± 34 Pa , G ′ ( 1 Hz ) = 2315 Pa ± 25 Pa . Note that E ∼ 3 G ′ . Rheometry measurements were carried out on a con - trolled stress rheometer ( Malvern , Gemini 150 ) at low fre - p - 2 Viscoelasticity of PAM gels quencies [ 0 . 001 Hz − 2 Hz ] in the linear regime ( deformation of 1 % ) , and possible slip was avoided . Interestingly , an ex - cellent agreement was found between these measurements and AFM microrheology experiments for all gels , as seen in Fig . 2 where matching occurs around 2 Hz for the 10 % gel . Note that with an adequate AFM equipment operat - ing at lower frequencies , all data should be obtained only with the AFM . Still it is interesting here to use rheometry and match both sets of data . 10 −2 10 0 10 2 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 f ( Hz ) G ′ , G ′′ ( P a ) G ′ Rheo G ′ AFM G ′′ Rheo G ′′ AFM Fig . 2 : Superposition of rheometrical ( open circles ) and AFM measurements ( stars , with standard deviations shown ) . The acrylamide content is 10 % in this case . T = 25 o C . The variations of the dynamic moduli ( Fig . 2 ) showed a constant elastic plateau modulus ( G 0N ) at low frequencies ( G 0N ≃ 2300 Pa ) . The gel underwent a glassy transition in the higher frequency regime as the AFM measurements did show . The slopes of both moduli G ′ and G ′′ vs . ω ( slightly smaller than 1 . 0 ) , were similar above 100 Hz . Rheological modelling . To predict the observed behav - ior , a rheological model was used . The complex modulus G ∗ ( ω ) was related to a relaxation function H ( λ ) using the formalism introduced by Winter and collaborators [ 2 ] : G ∗ ( ω ) = Z ∞ 0 H ( λ ) iωλ 1 + iωλ dλ λ ( 3 ) H ( λ ) is the continuous relaxation spectrum , the expres - sion of which is shown in this work to model the LVE response from ﬂow to glassy state . In particular , the ﬂow regime was described by the function H f ( λ ) , and associ - ated complex modulus G ∗ f ( ω ) from Eq . ( 3 ) : H f ( λ ) =     n f G 0N (cid:18) λ λ max (cid:19) n f if λ ≤ λ max 0 if λ > λ max ( 4 ) This power law behavior can describe the continuous relaxation time distribution required to model the plateau regime observed for G ′ in Fig . 2 at low frequencies , while G ′′ decreases with slope − n f . This model is unsuitable to describe the high frequency state , and consequently the BSW description [ 2 ] is insuﬃcient to predict the data ac - curately . Therefore a fractional derivative model [ 3 ] was prefered and added to the previous one , to account for high frequency data . The corresponding expression for G ∗ g ( ω ) in the transition , was simply given by : G ∗ g ( ω ) = G 1 ( iωλ 1 ) b 1 + ( iωλ 1 ) a ( 5 ) where a and b are the orders of fractional derivatives . Compatibility with thermodynamics [ 27 ] requires 0 < a ≤ b . This type of model accounts for the slopes in the glassy transition , as observed in the current data . The coupling of the two linear models is insured by the simple relationship G ∗ ( ω ) = G ∗ f ( ω ) + G ∗ g ( ω ) , and covers the whole frequency spectrum . The parameters of this global model are G 0N , λ max , n f , a , b , G 1 and λ 1 . Fig . 3 presents the role of each parameter , in a frequency range comparable with our experiments . G 0N appears naturally to be the classical elastic plateau modulus ( Fig . 3 ) . λ max is the maximum relaxation time corresponding to the ﬂow domain . In the case of gels , this speciﬁc time is out of reach since gels do not actually ﬂow and exhibit a plateau even at very low frequencies [ 28 ] . − n f is the slope of G ′′ at low frequencies , in a log – log plot and is found to lie between − 0 . 73 and − 0 . 06 . a represents the slopes of G ′ and G ′′ in the glass transition regime ( with a = b in Fig . 3 ) . G 1 is the high frequency modulus of G ′ , and is far above our data , so complementary rheological experiments would be nec - essary to reveal such high values of the limiting modulus [ 3 ] . λ 1 is a relaxation time related to the ﬁne microstruc - ture and is not shown in Fig . 3 . Actually 1 / λ 1 is a typical crossover frequency between the glass and solid domains . Finally b − a would correspond to the limiting slopes of G ′ and G ′′ moduli at the highest frequencies , not shown in Fig . 3 . We found that a = b leads to the optimal ﬁt . Fitting of the data was carried out for the four gels de - scribed above , characterized both in rheometry and AFM microrheology . The best - ﬁtting values of the parameters were determined by minimizing a weighted sum of squared residuals . The weights were chosen from the data . Min - imization was achieved using the Levenberg – Marquardt method . The initial guesses followed the discussion on the role of each single parameter ( see Fig . 3 ) . The best - ﬁtting values of the parameters are reported in Table 1 and the associated curves are presented in Fig - ures 4 – 7 . Very good agreement between the predictions and the model were obtained . Discussion . – Let us look at the behavior of the plateau modulus G 0 N , which increases with c , the acry - lamide concentration . G 0N is shown in log – log scale in Fig . 8 . A power law dependence G 0N ∼ c 3 . 0 ± 0 . 3 is found from the data . This exponent can be compared to other values from the literature . Indeed , previous observations p - 3 Y . Abidine et al .

The slope of the power law exponent corresponds to 3 . 0 ± 0 . 3 . a signiﬁcant role , as it is related to a possible crossover of the G ′ and G ′′ moduli at low frequencies which does not occur for such gels ( in our frequency range ) since they do not ﬂow at low frequencies . However , − n f , the low – frequency slope of G ′′ vs . ω , is a parameter of interest , and becomes closer to 0 , as gel concentration increases . This emphasizes the fact that high concentration gels exhibit moduli with almost ﬂat G ′ and G ′′ moduli ( see gels in Fig - ures 6 – 7 at 10 % and 15 % acrylamide concentration ) . Note that values of G ′ and G ′′ at low frequencies ( 0 . 001 Hz ) us - ing classical rheometry were diﬃcult to obtain , due to the long experimental times required , therefore a larger uncer - tainty is unavoidable for n f . Nevertheless , n f increases as c decreases , meaning that a lower crosslinking could even - tually lead to a crossing of G ′ and G ′′ at lower frequencies . At higher frequencies , G ′ and G ′′ vs . f exhibit slopes a and b between 0 . 82 and 0 . 98 ( see Table 1 ) . In all cases , the optimum was found for a = b , and used in the optimisation method . Both G ′ and G ′′ exhibit a slope a , related to the fractional derivatives in the model . The dependence of G ′ , G ′′ ∼ ω 3 / 4 suggested in the litterature for semiﬂexible polymers [ 32 ] is therefore close to our data . λ 1 was found to be almost constant ∼ 2 . 0 × 10 − 4 s , within experimental error , revealing no clear diﬀerence in the entanglement relaxational processes of the polyacry - lamide gels at very high frequencies . Therefore , all four networks show similar trends at high frequencies . Finally , the onset of the glass transition can be linked to the crossing of the G ′ and G ′′ moduli , at a typical fre - quency f T . Above this crossing frequency , both moduli increase with a similar power dependence G ′ ∼ ω a and G ′′ ∼ ω a , up to 500 Hz . This frequency is associated to a transition time λ T = 1 / 2 πf T . As can be seen in Figures 4 – 7 , when c increases , G ′ exhibits a longer plateau , and the crossing frequency f T increases between 40 Hz and 190 Hz . It is therefore a signature of the gel . This frequency f T can be found by inspection of G ′ . On the plateau , G ′ ∼ G 0N , then for higher frequencies , using Eq . ( 5 ) and a = b , we ﬁnd G ′ ∼ G 1 cos ( πa / 2 ) ( ωλ 1 ) a since ωλ 1 < < 1 in this domain . Therefore the transition frequency f T reads : f T = 1 2 πλ 1 (cid:18) G 0N G 1 cos ( πa / 2 ) (cid:19) 1 / a ( 6 ) The increase of f T with c is conﬁrmed by inspection of Table 1 . G 0N G 1 increases with c , since G 0N varies faster than G 1 with c , while cos ( πa / 2 ) decreases , thus the ra - tio G 0N G 1 cos ( πa / 2 ) increases and 1 / a increases with c as well . Since λ 1 is almost constant , we deduce that f T increases with polymer concentration . f T can be understood as an important parameter characterizing the transition from a polymer gel to a system where single – chains may ﬂuctuate between crosslinks . In this respect , it has been shown that polymeric systems undergo transitions , in the context of the Rouse model [ 23 ] or considering hydrodynamic inter - actions [ 24 ] . Theses processes involve a correlation length ξ , i . e . a characteristic length scale which estimates the ﬂuctuations and is usually measured by elastic and light scattering measurements . The correlation length ξ usu - ally varies like ξ ∼ c − 0 . 75 [ 23 ] , as veriﬁed experimentally for polyacrylamide gels [ 33 ] . The theoretical frequency f T possibly varies as f T ∼ c 2 . 75 [ 23 ] or c 2 . 25 [ 24 ] for entangled polymeric networks . In the context of gels , these features may show diﬀerences and have not yet been tested . Our measurements provide accurate data on the crossing of G ′ and G ′′ , thanks to AFM measurements . As the bisacry - lamide concentration is small , one can except the correla - tion length to be rather constant , on the order or 10nm as shown previously [ 34 ] , thus ξ and f T will depend mainly on polymer concentration c . A careful analysis of the data in Fig . 9 shows a power behavior f T ∼ c 1 . 6 ± 0 . 1 . This ex - ponent is slightly below the exponent predicted previously [ 24 ] . Nevertheless , the change in f T was captured , as an important network parameter – sensitive to concentration c – accessible from such measurements . Thus , our AFM – technique , coupled with classical rheology , brings together important information on the dynamics of such gels . p - 5 Y .

Both methods were used and matched on the elastic plateau , with higher fre - quency data obtained thanks to the AFM technique . A model was proposed to predict the experimental data . It includes a multiple relaxation spectrum at low frequen - cies combined with a fractional model for higher frequen - cies . The model parameters are related to the gels physical properties . In particular , a new characteristic frequency f T has been introduced at the onset of the glass transition and was compared to previous theories . Further applications of the model may be considered with other physical ( or chemical ) gels , as well as the study of biological systems , such as actin , tubulin newtworks , and ﬁnally living cells [ 16 ] . Indeed , this model , coupled with the use of high frequency AFM measurements , may allow to investigate more complex materials and provide simple parameters to distinguish them .
