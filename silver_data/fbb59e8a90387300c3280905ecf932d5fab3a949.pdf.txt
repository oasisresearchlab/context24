The Folate Receptor Works in Tandem with a Probenecid - sensitive Carrier in MAI04 Cells In Vitro Barton A . Kamen , Angela K . Smith , and Richard G . W . Anderson Departments ofPediatrics , Pharmacology , and Cell Biology and Neuroscience , University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center , Dallas , Texas 75235 - 9039 Abstract Previous studies have defined a novel route of internalization for the essential vitamin 5 - methyltetrahydrofolate in MA104 cells that begins with binding of the vitamin to the membrane receptor for folate . One of the critical steps in the pathway is the passage of 5 - methyltetrahydrofolate through the mem - brane into the cytoplasm . Utilizing both probenecid and low temperature as selective inhibitors , we have successfully blocked transmembrane movement of the vitamin into the cyto - plasm without affecting binding to the receptor or the internal - ization of the vitamin - receptor complex , which suggests that passage is through an anion carrier . This anion carrier , which mediates inward movement of 5 - methyltetrahydrofolate after it dissociates from the receptor , also appears to mediate the ef - flux of folylmonoglutamate , but not folylpolyglutamate , when the concentration of the former in the cytoplasm is sufficiently high . Since we also found that the synthesis of folylpolygluta - mates is regulated in these cells , most likely the intracellular concentration of the vitamin is controlled by regulating the flux of folylmonoglutamate through this carrier .

Invest . 1991 . 87 : 1442 - 1449 . ) Key words : caveola * endocytosis * folyl - polyglutamate * 5 - methyltetrahydrofolic acid * regulation Introduction The concentration of the essential vitamin 5 - methyltetrahy - drofolate ( 5 - CH3FH4 ) in human plasma varies between 10 and 20 nM . By contrast , the intracellular concentration ranges from 10 to 20 gM in hepatocytes and from 0 . 1 to 1 . 0 , uM in fibroblasts ( 1 ) . Most likely this wide variation in cellular folate concentration reflects the tissue demands for the vitamin . Rap - idly dividing cells , for example , may require large amounts of reduced folate for pyrimidine and purine synthesis whereas interphase cells do not have this demand . Transport epithelial cells such as those in mammary gland , kidney and placenta , on the other hand , may have a high intracellular concentration because they are specialized for scavenging folate and deliver - ing it with high efficiency to specific tissue spaces . The mecha - nisms that the cells in these tissues use to maintain a constant intracellular level of the vitamin are not known . In certain tissues the folate receptor is likely to play a key Address reprint requests to Dr .

Originally designated as a folate binding protein that is found in plasma and tissues ( 2 , 3 ) , this integral membrane protein is abundant in kidney and placenta , where most likely it is involved in transcellular 5 - methyltetra - hydrofolate transport . Receptor activity is also found in hemo - poietic cells ( 4 ) as well as several established epithelial cell lines ( 5 - 8 ) . The amino acid sequence derived from the cDNA for this protein predicts that it is held in the membrane by a glyco - syl - phosphatidylinositol linkage ( 9 ) . Biochemical studies have confirmed this prediction and , in addition , found that both alkyl and acyl - linked fatty chains are the probable anchors ( 9 , 10 ) . In an effort to understand the function of the folate recep - tor , we have focused our studies on the folate - deficient MA 104 cell , an established cell line that expresses large numbers of receptors ( 5 ) . These studies ( 5 , 11 - 13 ) have revealed that the folate receptor mediates 5 - methyltetrahydrofolate internaliza - tion using a novel form of endocytosis termed receptor - cou - pled transmembrane transport ( RCT ) . ' Current evidence sug - gests that this transport process takes place in four steps : ( a ) high - affinity binding of 5 - methyltetrahydrofolate to the recep - tor ; ( b ) translocation of the ligand - receptor complex into an internal , membrane bound compartment ; ( c ) dissociation of the folate from the receptor in response to an acidic environ - ment and movement across the membrane into the cytoplasm through an anion carrier ; ( d ) covalent addition of multiple glu - tamic acid residues to the 5 - methyltetrahydrofolate . Most likely this receptor system permits receptor - bearing cells to take up 5 - methyltetrahydrofolate efficiently when growing in physiological concentrations of the vitamin ( 12 ) . Deutsch et al . ( 14 ) have reported that the folate receptor in the KB line of nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells can mediate the uptake of methotrexate , which suggests that this transpoft pathway may be a target for chemotherapeutic strategies that employ antifo - late compounds . In contrast to the receptor - mediated internalization of 5 - methyltetrahydrofolate , a number of laboratories have shown that the uptake of folates and folate analogs by cultured cells involves a transmembrane carrier ( reviewed in reference 15 ) . A few of the characteristics ofthis carnier include : ( a ) Km for trans - port of 5 - 10 , uM ; ( b ) a V . . of 1 - 30 pmol / min per 10 6 cells ; ( c ) inhibition by low temperature ( 15 ) ; ( d ) inhibition by probene - cid as well as other anion carrier inhibitors ( 15 - 18 ) . This same organic anion carrier could be the carrier postulated to move folates from the receptor across the membrane into the cyto - plasm of cells during RCT ( 10 ) . If this is the case , then move - ment of receptor - bound 5 - methyltetrahydrofolate into the cy - toplasm of folate - deplete cells should be sensitive to those treat - ments that impair carrier activity . 1 .

Whereas there is good evidence that the receptor is organized into dense clusters on the cell surface in association with uncoated pits , electron mi - croscopy has failed so far to pinpoint the exact endocytic com - partment that houses the internal population of receptors ( 13 ) . Until the vesicular compartment can be identified , there re - mains the possibility that the receptor uses some method for becoming sequestered away from the cell surface that does not involve vesicle formation . Although the existence of a carrier or transporter for carrying 5 - methyltetrahydrofolate across the membrane has been postulated because ofthe unlikely possibil - ity that this highly charged molecule would be able to penetrate the lipid bilayer , there has not been any direct evidence that the folate receptor works in concert with such a carrier . Finally , previous studies ( 12 ) have shown that 5 - methyltetrahydrofo - late accumulation in the cytoplasm is regulated independently of receptor activity ; however , the exact mechanism of regula - tion has not been determined . The current study was designed to investigate further each of these three aspects of the model . We present evidence that there is an anion carrier that is used during RCT to transport folate from the receptor into the cytoplasm ; that folylmonoglu - tamate but not folylpolyglutamate derivatives of 5 - methylte - trahydrofolate can efflux through this same carrier ; that the formation of folylpolyglutamates is regulated in MA 104 cells ; and that this regulation , in turn , regulates the amount of 5 - methyltetrahydrofolate that the cell accumulates . Methods Materials Tissue culture . Culture flasks ( T - 25 ) were from Costar Data Packaging Corp . , Cambridge , MA . Medium 199 ( M199 ) with Earle ' s salts with or without folic acid was prepared per the Gibco Laboratories catalog .

Chemicals and radiochemicals . Radiolabeled folic acid ( [ 3H ] ; 20 - 40 Ci / M , MT783 ) was purchased from Moravek Biochemicals , City of Industry , CA . 5 - Methyltetrahydrofolate and 5 - methyl [ 3H ] tetrahydro - folate were synthesized from folic acid or [ 3H ] folic acid using enzy - matic reduction and chemical methylation as previously described ( 5 , 19 ) . Folic acid polyglutamates were purchased from Dr . G . Nair , De - partment of Biochemistry , University of South Alabama , Mobile , AL . DL - 5 - methyltetrahydrofolate ( MO132 ) , sodium Hepes ( H - 3375 ) , and probenecid ( P - 876 1 ) were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co . , St . Louis , MO . High pressure liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) reagents PIC - A [ ( tetrabutylammonium phosphate ( 85191 ) ] , and acetonitrile ( 84935 ) were purchased from Waters Associates , Milford , MA . HPLC - grade methanol ( A - 452 ) was from Fisher Scientific Co . , Pittsburgh , PA . Deionized water was made by filtration through a model 1000 reagent water system ( Hydro Service and Supplies , Inc . , Research Triangle Park , NC ) . All HPLC solvents were filtered before use through either a 0 . 45 - Mm filter ( HAWPO4700 ; Millipore Continental Water Systems , Bedford , MA ) or , ifthe volume was < 1 ml , through a 0 . 45 - Mm Millex - HV4 filter unit ( SJHV004NS ; Nihon Millipore , Yonezawa , Japan ) . Cell culture MA 104 cells , a monkey kidney epithelial cell line , were either grown continuously as a monolayer in folate - free M199 supplemented with 5 % ( vol / vol ) FCS ( medium A ) for folate deplete cells or grown in me - dium A that was supplemented with 10 AM 5 - methyltetrahydrofolate for folate - replete cells . Medium A contained - 5 nM folate and 0 . 68 mM glutamine . Fresh medium was added to stock cultures every 3 d . Cells for each experiment were set up according to a standard format . On day 0 , 2 . 0 X 105 cells were seeded into a T - 25 flask and grown for 5 d in the same medium . By day 5 of cell growth , folate deplete cells con - tained 0 . 5 - 1 . 0 pmol of folate / 106 cells , whereas folate - replete cells con - tained 20 - 30 pmol of folate / 106 cells . All experiments were done on day 5 . Measurement of membrane and cytoplasmicfolate After the labeling experiments , the cells were washed with DPBS and 1 . 5 ml of buffer A ( 10 mM Tris - base , pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 02 , gg / ml leupeptin and aprotinin , and 1 qM DL - 5 - methyltetrahydrofolate acid ) was added to each T - 25 flask at 4VC and the flasks were placed at - 80 ' C for at least 15 min . After the freezing step the cells were placed on an ice tray , and 0 . 5 ml ofice - cold buffer A was added to the dish to thaw the cells . The dissolved extract was aspirated , each flask was rinsed with 1 ml of buffer A , and the two samples were combined , all at 4VC . The com - bined extracts were centrifuged for 1 hr at 100 , 000 g in either an L8 - 70 using a 50 TI rotor or a TL - 100 using TLA 100 . 3 rotor ( Beckman Instruments , Inc . , Palo Alto , CA ) to separate the membrane fraction ( pellet ) from the cytoplasmic fraction ( supernatant fluid ) . The addition of unlabeled folate to the isolation buffer served to prevent cytoplasmic [ 3H ] folate from binding to unoccupied receptors on the membrane . The unlabeled folate did not displace receptor - bound [ 3H ] folate at 4Â°C ( l1 ) . Folate receptor activity was determined by either measuring the amount of 3H - folic acid binding or the amount of endogeneous 5 - methyltetrahydrofolate already bound using previously described methods ( 5 , 11 , 12 ) . Preparation of samples for HPLC analysis and analysis of folyl - polyglutamates Analysis ofradiolabeled folates in cells was carried out as previously described ( 12 ) . Briefly , the lyophilized cell lysate was dissolved in 0 . 1 - 0 . 3 ml of 1 % ( vol / vol ) fi - mercaptoethanol to which was added 9 vol of ice - cold acetonitrile . The sample was centrifuged for 3 min in a Beck - man model B microfuge at 4Â°C to pellet precipitated protein . The acetonitrile was evaporated from the supernatant fraction by incubat - ing for 30 - 40 min at 4Â°C under a stream ofnitrogen . The sample was subjected to a second microfuge centrifugation and the supernatant fraction filtered through a 0 . 45 gm filter before analysis by HPLC . HPLC identification of 5 - methyl [ 3H ] tetrahydrofolic acid and metabo - lites was carried out exactly as described previously ( 1 1 , 12 ) . The same chromatographic techniques were used to analyze unlabeled folate pools . However , the detection of unlabeled folates in the various frac - tions was made using a competition binding assay as previously de - scribed ( 20 ) . Collection and analysis of 100 0 . 3 - min samples allowed adequate resolution of the endogenous polyglutamates . Other methods All protein measurements were determined by the method ofBrad - ford ( 21 ) . Cells were counted using a standard hemocytometer . Results Characterization of 5 - methyltetrahydrofolate transmembrane transport . For the current studies we needed to know how effec - tively the receptor will function in MA 104 cells because we did not want receptor activity to obscure attempts to measure transmembrane carrier activity . Therefore , folate - deplete cells were incubated in the presence of either 20 , 10 , or 2 nM 5 - Receptor - coupled Carrier - mediated Folate Uptake 1443 methyl [ 3H ] tetrahydrofolate for 30 , 60 , or 120 min ( Fig . 1 ) and the amount of 5 - methyl [ 3H ] tetrahydrofolate present in the cy - toplasmic fraction was measured . After only 30 min ofincuba - tion , there was not any difference in the total amount of 5 - methyl [ 3H ] tetrahydrofolate that accumulated in cells that were exposed to the three different concentrations ; moreover , the proportion of 5 - methyl [ 3H ] tetrahydrofolate that was polyglu - tamated was approximately the same in all three sets of cells . After 2 h of incubation , however , cells incubated in the pres - ence of 10 and 20 nM had the same amount ofvitamin whereas there was a reduction in the amount of 5 - methyl [ 3H ] tetrahy - drofolate in cells that received the 2 nM concentration even though the level of folylpolyglutamate was not proportionally reduced . Upon examination of the uptake media for these cells , however , we found that the reduced uptake by these cells could be attributed to the depletion of 5 - methyl [ 3H ] tetrahydrofolate from the medium . These cells took up > 50 % of the vitamin initially present in the medium . These results indicate that receptor - mediated uptake of 5 - methyltetrahydrofolate is very effective ( Fig . 1 ) and , therefore , it would be necessary to bypass or inactivate the folate receptor to detect the presence of an anion carrier in the membrane . Three different sets of experimental conditions were used to disarm the receptor . First , we analyzed vitamin accumulation in folate replete MA 104 cells that have reduced receptor activ - ity ( 5 ) . Second , we measured uptake in both deplete and replete cells that were incubated in the presence of 2 , 000 nM 5 - methyl [ 3H ] tetrahydrofolate , which is a concentration that is close to the average Km for organic anion carriers involved in folate transport ( 15 ) but 1 , 000 - fold higher than the concentra - tion required to saturate the receptor . Finally , in some experi - ments receptor activity was blocked with folic acid , the high affinity ligand for this receptor that is not transported across the membrane ( 1 1 ) . The characteristics of folate deplete and replete cells are compared in Table I . Deplete cells had - 20 - fold fewer cyto - plasmic folates than replete cells and no detectable membrane - bound vitamin .

Accumulation of 5 - methyl [ 3H ] tetrahydrofolate by folate deplete cells . Folate - deplete MA 104 cells were prepared as described ( 5 ) . After washing with PBS , the cells were incubated for either 30 , 60 , or 120 min at 37Â°C in the presence of the indicated concentration of 5 - methyl [ 3H ] tetrahydrofolate . At the end of the incubation , both the total amount of [ 3H ] folate ( open bars ) and the amount of 3H - fo - lylpolyglutamates ( solid bars ) present in the cytoplasmic fraction were measured as described .

All values are normalized for 106 cells . Protein content was measured by the method of Bradford ( 18 ) . Cytoplasmic folate was determined by preparing cytoplasm , extracting the folates , and measuring the con - centration using a competitive binding assay ( 20 ) . Similar methodol - ogy was used to determine the concentration of 5 - methyltetrahydro - folate in the membrane fraction of these cells . Folate receptor activity corresponds to the amount of 5 - methyl [ 3Hltetrahydrofolate that bound to intact cells at 4VC after they had been washed with acid sa - line to remove any endogenous folate . in the presence of [ 3H ] folic acid at 4VC , the deplete cells bound two to five times more folic acid than replete cells , which con - firms that under these conditions the folate receptor is less ac - tive in replete cells . Folate - deplete cells took up 5 - methyl [ 3H ] tetrahydrofolate quite differently than did folate replete cells ( Fig . 2 ) . When folate - deplete cells ( Fig . 2 A ) were incubated for 2 h in the presence of either 20 or 2 , 000 nM 5 - methyl [ 3H ] tetrahydrofo - late , the 100 - fold difference in external ligand concentration U ) 5 u 0 4 , 5 0 4 - to . - 0 U ' - to lOr 5 TF 20 2000 2000 ( + ) 5 - Methyltetrahydrofolate ( nM ) B TV Glu , rF Glu , ~ T 20 2000 2000 ( + ) 5 - Nethyltetrahydrofolate ( nMl ) Figure 2 . Comparative ability of folate - deplete cells ( A ) and folate - re - plete cells ( B ) to accu - mulate 5 - methyl [ 3H ] - tetrahydrofolate . Folate replete cells ( 25 pmol folate / 106 cells ) and fo - late deplete cells ( 0 . 5 pmol folate / 106 cells ) were prepared as de - scribed . One set of dishes from each group ( + ) were preincubated for2h at 37Â°C in the presence of 50 nM un - labeled folic acid to block any receptors present on the mem - brane . This set of cells , together with a set that had not received folic acid were incubated for 2 h at 37Â°C in the pres - ence of 2 , 000 nM 5 - methyl [ 3H ] tetrahydrofolate . A third set ofcells was incubated for 2 h at 370C in the presence of 20 nM 5 - methyl [ 3H ] - tetrahydrofolate . At the end of the incubation , the cytoplasmic frac - tion was prepared and analyzed for total [ 3H ] folate ( open bars ) and for [ 3H ] folypolyglutamates ( Glu5 - 7 , solid bars ) as described . 1444 Kamen et al . I ^ - Ir A TF TF I caused only a threefold increase in cellular accumulation . More importantly , there was no difference between these two sets of cells in the amount of 5 - methyl [ 3H ] tetrahydrofolate polyglutamate that was synthesized ( solid column , Fig . 2 A ) . The uptake profile was the same for deplete cells that had their receptors blocked with folic acid before exposure to 2 , 000 nM 5 - methyl [ 3H ] tetrahydrofolate ( + , Fig . 2 A ) , although in the pres - ence of20 nM 5 - methyl [ 3H ] tetrahydrofolate folic acid - blocked cells did not take up any vitamin ( data not shown ) . In contrast to deplete cells , in the presence of 20 nM 5 - methyl [ 3H ] tetrahy - drofolate the replete cells did not take up any vitamin ( Fig . 2 B ) . Raising the concentration to 2 , 000 nM induced the replete cells to accumulate significant amounts of 5 - methyltetrahydro - folate ; however , under these conditions neither receptor blocked ( + , Fig . 2 B ) nor unblocked cells synthesized any folyl - polyglutamates . The above results clearly show that in the presence of 2 , 000 nM 5 - methyltetrahydrofolate uptake is independent of the fo - late receptor . Previous studies have shown ( 16 - 18 ) that folate replete cells can accumulate folates by a probenecid - sensitive , anion carrier . To see if this inhibitor affected 5 - methyltetrahy - drofolate uptake in MA 104 cells , folate deplete cells were incu - bated in the presence or absence of 10 mM probenecid for 30 min before the addition of 2 , 000 nM 5 - methyl [ 3Hltetrahydro - folate . After 2 h of incubation the control cells had bound 2 pmol / 106 cells to the membrane and accumulated 9 pmol / 106 cells in the cytoplasm . By contrast , the probenecid treated cells had the same amount on the membrane but there was an 80 % decrease in the amount of vitamin in the cytoplasm . Since receptor independent uptake was inhibited by pro - benecid , we next ascertained the effect of this drug on receptor dependent accumulation ( Fig . 3 ) . Cells were incubated in the presence of 20 nM 5 - methyl [ 3H ] tetrahydrofolate with varying concentrations of probenecid for 4 h at 370C and assayed for accumulation of folate in the cytoplasmic fraction . Whereas 0 . 01 - 0 . 1 mM probenecid had no effect , there was progressive inhibition at higher concentrations with nearly complete inhibi - tion of uptake at 10 mM . We also measured the amount of 5 - methyl [ 3H ] tetrahydrofolate that was bound to the mem - brane of 10 mM probenecid - treated cells and found that both the internal and external populations of receptor were labeled ; therefore , neither binding nor internalization of receptor were affected by probenecid ( data not shown ) . These results suggested that both receptor - independent and 4 - Figure 3 .

At the end ofthe incubation , 20 nM 5 - methyl [ 3H ] tetrahydrofolate was added to each dish and the cells were further incubated for 4 h at 37Â°C . The cells were then rinsed and the amount of [ 3H ~ folate in the cytoplasm was determined as described . 20 - - Figure 4 .

To determine the proper incubation time for linear transport , sets ofcells were incubated for either 5 , 10 , or 120 min in the presence of four different concentrations of 5 - methyl [ 3H ] - tetrahydrofolate : 0 . 2 AM ( 5 X 103 cpm / pmol ) ; 0 . 5 AM ( 5 X 103 cpm / pmol ) ; 1 AM ( 1 x 103 cpm / pmol ) ; 2 AM ( 1 X 103 cpm / pmol ) . At the end of the incubation , the cells were washed and the cytoplasmic pool offolates was extracted and analyzed by HPLC . To ensure that only the transport of 5 - methyl [ 3H ] tetrahydrofolate was being measured , only the 5 - methyl [ 3H ] tetrahydrofolate peak was used in the calcula - tion . In addition , a parallel set of dishes was used to measure transport in the presence of 10 mM probenecid , and the amount of authentic 5 - methyl [ H ] tetrahydrofolate taken up under these conditions was subtracted from all values shown . The plotted data is from the 10 - min incubation time . Each value is the average of duplicate measurements . receptor - dependent uptake in folate - deplete MA 104 cells uti - lize an anion carrier for the transmembrane transport step . We next measured the Km and Va , for 5 - methyl [ 3H ] tetrahydrofo - late transport through this carrier in folate deplete cells that had been pretreated with 10 nM folic acid to block any receptor activity . The Lineweaver - Burk plot shown in Fig . 4 was derived from measuring initial velocity at substrate concentrations ranging from 200 to 2 , 000 nM 5 - methyl [ 3H ] tetrahydrofolate . The initial velocity represents the velocity measured in un - treated cells minus the velocity obtained when the cells were preincubated in the presence of 10 mM probenecid for thirty minutes . This method of calculation insured that we were mea - suring the properties of the transport step that is used by the folate receptor pathway . From this plot , we determined that the Km = 1 . 0 , uM and the Vm . = 0 . 32 pmol / min per 106 cells . Other studies have shown that carrier - mediated transport of 5 - methyl [ 3H ] tetrahydrofolate is temperature sensitive ( re - viewed in reference 15 ) . Therefore , we next compared the up - take of 5 - methyl [ 3H ] tetrahydrofolate in folate - depleted MA104 cells at 370C with uptake at 210C ( Fig . 5 ) . Cells were incubated in the presence of 5 - methyl [ 3H ] tetrahydrofolate at either temperature for various times and assayed for the amount that bound to the outside of the cell surface ( Fig . 5 A ) and the amount that was internalized into both membrane and cytoplasmic compartments ( Fig . 5 B ) . At both temperatures the externally oriented receptor bound folate with the same kinetics . Internalization , by contrast , was markedly inhibited in 21 ' C incubated cells ( Fig . 5 B ) . Moreover , in separate exper - iments we used ultracentrifugation to separate the membrane bound and cytoplasmic fractions of internalized folate from cells that had been incubated for 4 h at 21 ' C in the presence of the vitamin and found that all of the folate was in the mem - brane fraction . These results indicate that the anion carrier that transports 5 - methyltetrahydrofolate into the cytoplasm of MA 104 cells is very temperature sensitive .

At the end of each in - cubation , the cells were chilled and washed before being treated with an acid wash to remove externally oriented , surface - bound 5 - methyl [ 3H ] tetrahydrofo - late ( A ) . The acid stripped cells were then analyzed for the total amount of folate that had accumulated ( B ) . Each value is the average of duplicate measurements . Polyglutamation regulates cytoplasmic accumulation of 5 - methyltetrahydrofolate . The direction of movement through a carrier is dictated by the concentration gradient ofthe substrate ( 22 ) . For movement to be inward , therefore , the 5 - methyltetra - hydrofolate that reaches the cytoplasm must be modified so that it cannot diffuse back across the membrane carrier . Sev - eral investigators have suggested that folylpolyglutamates are generated for the purpose of retaining the vitamin in the cell ( 23 ) . If this is true , then folylmonoglutamates but not folylpo - lyglutamates should be able to move out of the cell via the anion carrier . We took advantage ofthe high concentration of folylmon - oglutamate that accumulated in cells incubated in the presence of 2 , 000 nM 5 - methyl [ 3Hltetrahydrofolate ( Fig . 2 ) to see if this form ofthe intracellular vitamin was capable of effluxing from the cell by the probenecid inhibitable anion carrier .

This loss was rapid and completely blocked by probenecid ( U , Fig . 6 ) . Upon analy - sis of what remained in the cytoplasmic fraction after efflux , all of the loss was from the folylmonoglutamate pool . In Fig . 2 we found that when cells with higher than normal levels of folate ( folate - replete cells ) were incubated in the pres - ence of 2 , 000 nM 5 - methyl [ 3H ] tetrahydrofolate , only folyl - monoglutamate derivatives accumulated in the cytoplasm . Moreover , exposing folate deplete cells to this concentration of 5 - methyltetrahydrofolate did not force cells to synthesize any more folylpolyglutamate than did incubating the cells in the presence of 20 nM vitamin even though there was a four - to fivefold difference in the cytoplasmic concentration of folyl - monoglutamate . These results suggested that the synthesis of folylpolyglutamates was regulated . This was confirmed by comparing the time course of [ 3H ] folylpolyglutamate accumu - lation with total accumulation offolates ( Fig . 7 ) . Folate - deplete cells were incubated in the presence 20 nM 5 - methyl [ 3Hjtetra - hydrofolate for various times and then analyzed for the pres - ence of [ 3H ] folypolyglutamate ( - , Fig . 7 ) as compared to total [ 3H ] folate ( 0 , Fig . 7 ) . Initially only folylmonoglutamate accu - mulated ; however , after 2 h of incubation , significant amounts of [ 3H ] folylpolyglutamate began to appear . After 2 h ofincuba - tion , the concentration of [ 3H ] folylmonoglutamate plateaued at 0 . 5 - 0 . 7 pmol / 106 cells and did not change for the next 24 h . Therefore , the increase in total [ 3H ] folate after this time was due exclusively to an accumulation of [ 3H ] folylpolyglutamate and the majority ofthis was folylpentaglutamate and folylhex - aglutamate ( data not shown ) . Likewise , after 6 h ofincubation the total accumulation plateaued as the rate of folylpolygluta - mate accumulation declined . In contrast to these cells , folate - replete cells incubated in the presence of 20 nM 5 - methyl [ 3H ] - tetrahydrofolate took up only a modest amount of 5 - methyl [ 3Hjtetrahydrofolate during the 24 - h incubation ( 0 , Fig . 7 ) and virtually all of this was folylmonoglutamate . These results ( Figs . 2 and 7 ) indicate that regardless of whether folate is delivered by the receptor - dependent or the receptor - independent pathway , cells will only accumulate a certain amount of folylpolyglutamate and then the synthesis of 0 - 0 A 0 0 4 8 12 16 20 24 Time ( hours ) Figure 7 .

Folate - deplete cells were incubated for 24 h at 370C in the presence of 20 nM 5 - methyl [ 3H ] tetrahydrofolate and the total radiolabeled folate profile was determined by HPLC . Folate - replete cells , by contrast , were grown for 5 wk in l0 ' n M 5 - methyltetrahydrofolate . Total folate was extracted from the cells and 50 pmol of the sample were loadjed on an HPLC column . Fractions were collected at 0 . 3 - min intervals and the concentration of folate was measured using a com - petition binding assay as previously described ( 17 ) . Glue = the total number of glutamic acid residues . these derivatives is inhibited . If cells are presented with a high extracellular concentration of folate , the additional vitamin taken up is found primarily in the folylmonoglutamate pool . This is shown dramatically in Table II where the folylpolyglu - tamate profile is compared between folate replete cells grown continuously in the presence of high concentrations ( 10 ' M ) of 5 - methyltetrahydrofolate for several weeks and folate de - plete cells grown over night in the presence of 20 nM 5 - methyl [ 3H ] tetrahydrofolate . There was very little difference be - tween the two sets of cells in the amount of 5 - methyltetrahy - drofolate that contained five to seven glutamic acid residues . On the other hand , the folate replete cells had 10 times more folylmonoglutamate and a significant amount of folyltrigluta - mate . Discussion The folate binding protein was discovered more than 20 years ago as a soluble protein in milk and plasma that had a high affinity for folic acid ( 2 , 3 ) . Since that time , evidence has accu - mulated that this molecule behaves like a membrane receptor ( 24 ) that concentrates folates at the surface of certain cells for delivery to the cytoplasm ( 5 , 7 , 11 - 13 ) . During the same time period , extensive research has documented the ability offolates to gain entrance to cells by an organic anion carrier ( 15 - 18 , 25 - 27 ) . The results of the current investigation bring these two lines of research together by showing that the receptor - me - diated delivery of 5 - methyltetrahydrofolate involves the move - ment of the vitamin from the receptor through a membrane carrier into the cytoplasm and that this carrier has the proper - ties of the same anion carrier that has been characterized by these different investigators . Existence of the carrier . An important goal in our experi - mental design was to gather data that would clarify the relation - ship , if any , between the transport of folates through the or - ganic anion carrier characterized by other laboratories and the internalization of 5 - methyltetrahydrofolate by the folate recep - tor pathway . The conditions for inactivating the folate receptor - blocking with folic acid or growth in the presence of5 - meth - yltetrahydrofolate - produce cells that are similar to those used in the transport studies ( 15 ) . We , too , found that these cells will take up 5 - methyltetrahydrofolate through an organic anion car - rier but that to measure significant uptake under these condi - tions required 100 - 1 , 000 - fold more vitamin than is required to achieve comparable intracellular concentrations in cells that have an active folate receptor pathway . We also found that transport was inhibited by probenecid and that the carrier in - volved had a Km for transport of 1 gM and a V . , , of 0 . 32 pmol / min per 106 cells , which are values that are in the range for folate transport in other systems ( 15 ) . Finally , we found that the carrier allows folylmonoglutamates to move in both direc - tions across the membrane ( Fig . 6 ) . Therefore , MA104 cells have an anion carrier that is similar to the carrier characterized in other laboratories . Since probenecid inhibited folate transport through the an - ion carrier in cells with inactivated folate receptors , we next assessed the effect ofthis agent on receptor dependent uptake . Probenecid totally inhibited the receptor - mediated delivery of 5 - methyltetrahydrofolate to the cytoplasm of cells without af - fecting either binding to the receptor or the internalization of the 5 - methyltetrahydrofolate - receptor complex . We also found that at 21 ' C accumulation of 5 - methyl [ 3H ] tetrahydro - folate into the cytoplasm was completely blocked without af - fecting total membrane binding and only slowing receptor in - ternalization . Since these treatments are known to inhibit the movement of folates through organic anion carriers ( 15 - 18 ) , this is strong evidence that after dissociating from the receptor , 5 - methyltetrahydrofolate moves across the membrane through a transmembrane carrier . These results present a paradox . We noted while measuring the Km and Vma . for the anion carrier ( Fig . 4 ) that when the extracellular concentration of folate fell below 200 nM , we could not detect any receptor independent 5 - methyltetrahy - drofolate accumulation in the cytoplasm offolate deplete cells even after 2 h ofincubation . The calculated V . for the carrier , however , predicts that even if the extracellular concentration was as low as 20 nM 5 - methyltetrahydrofolate the cells should have accumulated 0 . 8 pmol / 106 cells in this time . There are several possible explanations for this discrepancy . First , the car - rier may not obey Michaelis - Menton kinetics at low concentra - tions offolate . Secondly , the unstirred water layer at the mem - brane surface may not easily equilibrate with the extracellular space at low vitamin concentrations so that in the vicinity of the carrier the actual concentration of 5 - methyltetrahydrofo - late is far lower than what it is in the medium . A third consider - ation is the intracellular concentration of 5 - methyltetrahydro - folate . Folate deplete cells still have an intracellular folate con - centration of 1 gM . Within 1 h of incubation in the presence of 20 nM 5 - methyltetrahydrofolate , the cytoplasmic concentra - tion has risen to 2 jM with half of this being folylmonogluta - mate ( 12 ) . Therefore , the carrier is always transporting against a gradient of folate , which is not taken into consideration in the calculation of Vmi , , and Km . Regardless of the correct reason for the difference between calculated and observed receptor inde - pendent uptake , our results show that a functional folate recep - tor can effectively deliver 5 - methyltetrahydrofolate to the cyto - plasm of deplete cells even when the extracellular concentra - tion is < 2 nM ( Fig . 1 ) . Receptor - coupled Carrier - mediated Folate Uptake 1447 Polyglutamation regulates cytoplasmic accumulation of5 - methyltetrahydrofolate . Previously we showed that folate de - plete cells accumulate 5 - methyltetrahydrofolate for - 6 h but after this time the rate of accumulation plateaus ( 1 1 , 12 ) ; cessa - tion of uptake was not due to inactivation ofthe receptor . Since folylpolyglutamate derivatives will not efflux through the an - ion carrier , a convenient way to control 5 - methyltetrahydrofo - late accumulation would be to regulate the size of the folyl - polyglutamate pool . This could be accomplished by inhibiting the activity of folylpoly - y - glutamate synthetase , the enzyme responsible for the addition of glutamic acid residues to folyl - monoglutamate ( 23 , 28 - 30 ) . Four pieces of evidence from the current study suggest that this enzyme is the target for regu - lating intracellular folate levels . ( a ) When cells grown in l - 5 M 5 - methyltetrahydrofolate for several weeks ( folate replete ) were incubated in the presence of 2 , 000 nM 5 - methyl [ 3H ] tetrahy - drofolate for 2 h at 370C , the cells accumulated only the folyl - monoglutamate derivative . In the same experiment , however , folate deplete cells incubated under the same conditions synthe - sized a significant amount of folylpolyglutamates . ( b ) The total uptake of 5 - methyl [ 3H ] tetrahydrofolate and the synthesis of folylpolyglutamate derivatives plateau together , suggesting that as synthesis of the folylpolylglutamate derivatives ceases , up - take stops . ( c ) Folate deplete cells incubated in the presence of either 2 , 000 or 20 nM 5 - methyl [ 3H ] tetrahydrofolate for 2 h have the same amount of folylpolyglutamate derivatives , which suggests that after a critical intracellular concentration of folylpolyglutamates is reached , further synthesis is inhibited . ( d ) Cells that are induced to accumulate high concentrations of folylmonoglutamate rapidly lose this folate , but not polygluta - mate derivatives , when incubated in folate free medium . The results ofthis study extend earlier proposals ( reviewed in 23 ) that polyglutamation of folates is important for cellular retention by implicating folylpoly - ' y - glutamate synthetase in the control ofintracellular folate concentration . In the absence of this enzyme cultured cells fail to accumulate normal amounts offolates ( 31 ) . Cook et al . ( 30 ) have purified mamma - lian folylpoly - y - glutamate and found evidence that long - chain folylpolyglutamates inhibit the activity of the enzyme . The fo - late deplete MA 104 cell has allowed us to detect a similar type of regulatory phenomenon . The exact mechanism of regula - tion in these cells , however , remains to be determined . Spatial organization of the receptor and the anion carrier in the membrane . A striking conclusion from this study is that the folate receptor provides the 5 - methyltetrahydrofolate substrate for the anion carrier when these cells are incubated in the pres - ence of low concentrations of the vitamin . At these concentra - tions of folate , there is minimal movement into the cell in the absence of the receptor ! The most likely explanation for this phenomenon is that the receptor and the carrier are coupled at the cell surface ; in other words , the two molecules must be spatially arranged so that they are contiguous in the plane of the lipid bilayer . Otherwise , when the 5 - methyltetrahydrofo - late dissociates from the receptor , it will tend to diffuse into the medium instead of the cell . Whereas morphological evidence has implicated the caveola , or uncoated pit , as the region of plasma membrane that compartmentalizes receptor - mediated folate transport ( 13 ) , these biochemical results independently emphasize the need for specialized membrane machinery to carry out receptor coupled transmembrane transport .
