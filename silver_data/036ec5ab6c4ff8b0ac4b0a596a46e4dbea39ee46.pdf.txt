Hess 5 * We introduce a method for optically imaging intracellular proteins at nanometer spatial resolution . Numerous sparse subsets of photoactivatable fluorescent protein molecules were activated , localized ( to È 2 to 25 nanometers ) , and then bleached . The aggregate position information from all subsets was then assembled into a superresolution image . We used this method—termed photoactivated localization microscopy—to image specific target proteins in thin sections of lysosomes and mitochondria ; in fixed whole cells , we imaged vinculin at focal adhesions , actin within a lamellipodium , and the distribution of the retroviral protein Gag at the plasma membrane . T ransfected cells expressing fluorescent proteins ( 1 ) contain information that is accurate at the molecular level about the spatial organization of the target proteins to which they are bound . However , the best reso - lution that can be obtained by diffraction - limited conventional optical techniques is coarser than the molecular level by two orders of mag - nitude . Great progress has been made with superresolution methods that penetrate beyond this limit , such as near field ( 2 ) , stimulated emis - sion depletion ( 3 ) , structured illumination ( 4 , 5 ) , and reversible saturable optical fluorescence tran - sitions microscopy ( 6 ) , but the goal remains a fluorescence technique capable of achieving reso - lution closer to the molecular scale . Early results ( 7 ) in single - molecule micros - copy ( 8 ) and the spatiospectral isolation of individual exciton recombination sites in a semi - conductor quantum well ( 9 ) led to a proposal for a means of molecular resolution fluorescence microscopy a decade ago ( 10 ) . In brief , individual molecules densely packed within the resolution limit of a given instrument E as defined by its point - spread function ( PSF ) ^ are first isolated from one another on the basis of one or more distinguishing optical character - istics . Each molecule is then localized to much higher precision by determining its center of fluorescence emission through a statistical fit of the ideal PSF to its measured photon distribu - tion ( Fig . 1 ) . When the background noise is negligible compared with the molecular signal , the error in the fitted position is s x , y , s / ( N ½ ) , where s is the standard deviation of a Gaussian approximating the true PSF ( , 200 nm for light of wavelength l 0 500 nm ) and N is the total number of detected photons ( 11 , 12 ) . Given that it is possible to detect many more than 10 4 photons from a single fluorophore before it bleaches , single - molecule localization to nearly 1 - nm precision has already been demonstrated ( 13 – 15 ) and applied to studies of molecular motor dynamics ( 13 ) . Multiple emitters within a single diffraction - limitedregion ( DLR ) havebeenisolatedfromone another by either spectral ( 15 , 16 ) or temporal means , the latter exploiting the photobleaching ( 14 , 17 ) or blinking ( 18 ) of the emitters . How - ever , the number of emitters isolated per DLR ( typically 2 to 5 ) has been too small to give resolution within the DLR that is comparable to existing superresolution techniques , and it is far from the molecular level . Here , we developed a method for isolation of single molecules at high densities ( up to È 10 5 / m m 2 ) based on the serial photoactivation and subsequent bleaching of numerous sparse subsets of photoactivatable fluorescent protein ( PA - FP ) molecules ( 19 – 24 ) within a sample . We then applied the method to image specific target proteins in thin ( È 50 - to 80 - nm ) sections and near the surfaces of fixed cultured cells , resolving the most precisely localized molecules therein at separations ( È 10 nm ) approaching the molecular level . The method and typical data subsets are shown in Fig . 1 . Cultured mammalian cells ex - pressing PA - FP – tagged target proteins were prepared by transient transfection , fixed , and processed on cover slips either as whole cells or in cryosections cut from a centrifuged pellet of cells ( 25 ) . Such cover slips were then placed in a custom microscope chamber ( fig . S1 ) de - signed to minimize thermal and mechanical drift ( fig . S2 ) ( 25 ) . They were continuously excited by a laser at a wavelength ( l exc 0 561 nm ) near the excitation maximum of the ac - tivated form of the expressed PA - FPs . Finally , to minimize both autofluorescence and detector noise , they were imaged by total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy ( 13 , 26 ) onto an electron - multiplying charge coupled device ( EMCCD ) camera that can detect single photons . Initial image frames typically consisted of sparse fields of individually resolvable single molecules on a weaker background presumably dominated by the much larger population of PA - FP molecules still in the inactivated state . When necessary , excitation and thus bleach - ing was maintained until such sparse fields were obtained . Additional image frames were then captured until single - molecule bleaching resulted in a mean molecular separation con - siderably larger than that required for isolation ( Fig . 1 , A and C ) . At that point , we applied a light pulse from a second laser at a wavelength ( l act 0 405 nm ) capable of activating the re - maining inactive PA - FPs , at a duration and in - tensity chosen so that the overall density of activated PA - FPs was increased back to a higher , but still resolvable , level ( Fig . 1 , B and D ) . This process of photoactivation , measurement , and bleaching was then repeated ( movie S1 ) for many cycles over È 10 4 to 9 10 5 image frames ( depending on the expression level and spatial distribution of the PA - FPs ) until the population of inactivated , unbleached molecules was de - pleted . At typical frame rates of È 0 . 5 to 1 . 0 s , between 2 and 12 hours were required to acquire a complete image stack that could be distilled to a single superresolution image containing È 10 5 to 9 10 6 localized molecules . We con - tinued to explore methods ( such as brighter molecules , higher excitation power , and higher activation density ) to speed this process . When the xy frames from any such image stack are summed across time t , the molecular signals overlap to produce a diffraction - limited image ( Fig . 1 , E and F ) similar to that obtained by conventional TIRF , in which all molecules emit simultaneously ( fig . S3 ) . However , when the data are plotted in a multidimensional volume xyt ( Fig . 1 , center ) , the signal from each molecule m is uniquely isolated and can be summed at each pixel and across all of 1 Howard Hughes Medical Institute , Janelia Farm Research Campus , Ashburn , VA 20147 , USA . 2 New Millennium Re - search , LLC , Okemos , MI 48864 , USA . 3 Cell Biology and Metabolism Branch , National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ( NICHD ) , Bethesda , MD 20892 , USA . 4 National High Magnetic Field Laboratory , Florida State University , Tallahassee , FL 32310 , USA . 5 NuQuest Research , LLC , La Jolla , CA 92037 , USA . * These authors contributed equally to this work . †To whom correspondence should be addressed .

This result ( Fig . 1G , left ) is then fitted using a robust nonlinear least squares algorithm to an assumed Gaussian PSF of free center coordinates x o , y o ( Fig . 1G , center ) ( 25 ) , yielding coordinates x m , y m for the location of the molecule , with a position uncertainty ( s x , y ) m . Finally , each molecule is rendered in a new xy frame as a Gaussian of standard deviation ( s x , y ) m ( rather than the much larger standard deviation s of the original PSF ) , centered at x m , y m ( Fig . 1 , G , right , and A ¶ to D ¶ ) and normalized to unit strength when integrated over all xy space . Thus , the super - resolution image obtained by summing the rendered Gaussians associated with all localized molecules in the original image stack ( Fig . 1 , E ¶ and F ¶ ) provides a probability density map where brightness is proportional to the likeli - hood that a PA - FP molecule can be found at a given location . This technique , termed photoactivated lo - calization microscopy ( PALM ) , is capable of resolving the most precisely localized mole - cules at separations of a few nanometers . These represent the very brightest emitters ( the much larger population of all isolated molecules ex - hibits a much broader range of photon counts ; fig . S4 ) . Thus , when rendering PALM images , a fundamental trade - off exists : Including fewer , but brighter , molecules results in higher local - ization and crisper images , but at a reduced molecular density giving less complete infor - mation about the spatial distribution of the target protein ( fig . S5 ) . Both parameters— localization precision and the density of rendered molecules—are key to defining performance in PALM . Their specific values for the images in Figs . 2 to 4 are given in table S1 . This performance is largely dictated by the photophysical characteristics of the PA - FPs . Longer photobleaching half - life leads to more photons per molecule , but for a given excitation intensity , it also requires longer data acquisition times between activation pulses to maintain an appropriate density of individually resolv - able molecules . Higher excitation cross - sectional s and fluorescence quantum efficiency F can speed this process of signal extraction and bleaching , with the added benefit of increasing the molecular contrast relative to the autofluo - rescence background . Also vital is the contrast C ( l exc ) 0 ( sF ) act / ( sF ) inact between the PA - FP in its activated and inactivated state at l exc , because this dictates the maximum molecular density beyond which the background from many weakly emitting inactivated molecules in a DLR dominates the signal from a single ac - tivated one . PA - FPs that remain activated until bleached ensure that all possible photons are extracted . Finally , PA - FPs less prone to blinking are desirable , given that it can be difficult to distinguish a single blinking molecule from multiple molecules that are serially activated and bleached in the same DLR ( 25 ) . Although we have demonstrated isolation and localization with both green E photoactivatable green fluorescent protein ( PA - GFP ) and Dronpa ^ Fig . 2 . Comparative summed - molecule TIRF ( A ) and PALM ( B ) images of the same region within a cryo - prepared thin section from a COS - 7 cell expressing the lysosomal transmembrane protein CD63 tagged with the PA - FP Kaede . The larger boxed region in ( B ) , when viewed at higher magnification ( C ) reveals smaller associated membranes that may represent interacting lysosomes or late endosomes that are not resolvable by TIRF . In a region where the section is nearly orthogonal to the lysosomal membrane , the most highly localized molecules fall on a line of width È 10 nm ( inset ) . In an obliquely cut region [ ( D ) , from the smaller boxed region in ( B ) ] , the distribution of CD63 within the membrane plane can be discerned . Fig . 1 . The principle behind PALM . A sparse subset of PA - FP molecules that are attached to proteins of interest and then fixed within a cell are activated ( A and B ) with a brief laser pulse at l act 0 405 mm and then imaged at l exc 0 561 mm until most are bleached ( C ) . This process is repeated many times ( C and D ) until the population of inactivated , unbleached molecules is depleted . Summing the molecular images across all frames results in a diffraction - limited image ( E and F ) . However , if the location of each molecule is first determined by fitting the expected molecular image given by the PSF of the microscope [ ( G ) , center ] to the actual molecular image [ ( G ) , left ] , the molecule can be plotted [ ( G ) , right ] as a Gaussian that has a standard deviation equal to the uncertainty s x , y in the fitted position . Repeating with all molecules across all frames ( A ¶ through D ¶ ) and summing the results yields a superresolution image ( E ¶ and F ¶ ) in which resolution is dictated by the uncertainties s x , y as well as by the density of localized molecules .

Each also exhibits high contrast rela - tive to both the inactivated state and autoflu - orescence background at l exc 0 561 nm . We used PALM imaging to view intra - cellular structures in thin cryosections ( 25 ) , akin to those used in transmission electron microsco - py ( TEM ) but imaged under ambient conditions ( Figs . 2 and 3 ) . In Fig . 2 , lysosomes in a COS - 7 cell are visualized through expression of the lysosomal transmembrane protein CD63 fused to Kaede . Localization to the lysosome mem - brane was confirmed by comparative immuno - fluorescence labeling in similarly prepared samples ( fig . S6 ) . A TIRF image shows the outlines of the limiting membrane ( Fig . 2A ) but only hints at the intricate structure that is re - solved by PALM , such as smaller associated membranes that may represent interacting lyso - somes or late endosomes ( Fig . 2 , B and C ) . Indeed , in regions where the section plane is nearly orthogonal to the membrane , the most highly localized molecules fall on a line with an apparent width of È 10 nm ( inset , Fig . 2C ) , demonstrating that they are indeed fixed and that sample drift has been successfully miti - gated ( 25 ) . In other regions of the cryosection where the cut is more oblique to the lysosome , a wider , yet still sharply defined , swath of mem - brane is projected onto the image plane ( Fig . 2D ) , permitting detailed investigation of the distribution of CD63 within the membrane plane . In Fig . 3 , PALM images of dEosFP - tagged cytochrome - C oxidase import sequence local - ized within the matrix of mitochondria in a COS - 7 cell are compared with TEM images of the same mitochondria . The high degree of correlation between the two data sets validates the PALM imaging principle , and the sharpness of the mitochondrial edges ( Fig . 3H ) as viewed by PALM is far closer to that seen by TEM than that observed by diffraction - limited TIRF ( Fig . 3A ) . Such comparative PALM / TEM im - aging permits the nanometer - scale distribution of a specified protein to be determined in relation to the rest of the cellular ultrastructure at much higher molecular density than in im - munolabeled TEM—more than 5500 molecules are localized in Fig . 3E , compared with the 20 or so particles typical in immunogold labeling of the mitochondrial matrix . Superposition of the PALM and TEM images ( Fig . 3 , D and G ) also reveals that the matrix reporter molecules extend up to , but not into , the È 20 - nm outer mitochondrial membrane , underscoring the resolution capability of the technique . Corre - lated PALM / TEM does not have the added preparation steps and specificity issues asso - ciated with exogenous labels for combined fluorescence / EM such as fluorescein or resoru - fin arsenical helix binder ( 27 ) . Finally , efforts are underway to establish dual - labeled PALM or PALM fluorescence resonance energy trans - fer , which would permit the relative distribution or regions of interaction between multiple proteins to be discerned at the nanometer level . Thin sections are advantageous for PALM be - cause they exhibit less autofluorescence than bulk samples , ensure that the PA - FPs are immobile , and permit the study of intracellular organelles that are inaccessible under TIRF excitation . How - ever , demonstration of PALM on fixed cultured cells in phosphate - buffered saline ( Fig . 4 ) is also notable both as a means to study proteins at or near the plasma membrane under minimally invasive conditions and as a precursor to eventual three - dimensional ( 3D ) PALM imaging . Confirmation that the nanometer - level resolu - tion of PALM is retained under such conditions is given by the comparison of TIRF ( Fig . 4A ) and PALM ( Fig . 4B ) images of dEos - fused vinculin at focal adhesion regions ( fig . S7 ) of a fox lung fibroblast ( FoLu ) cell to a cover slip . PALM reveals the heterogeneity within a selected attach - ment ( box , Fig . 4A ) and , in one subregion , sug - gests the partial assembly of a vinculin network ( arrows , Fig . 4B ) . Similarly , a TIRF image ( Fig . 4C ) of tandem - dimer EosFP - fused actin in a cultured FoLu cell ( fig . S8 ) shows both large cytoskeletal stress fibers and a lamellipodium , whereas PALM within the latter ( Fig . 4D ) reveals an increased concentration of actin at the leading Fig . 3 . Comparative summed - molecule TIRF ( A ) , PALM ( B ) , TEM ( C ) , and PALM / TEM overlay ( D ) images of mitochondria in a cryo - prepared thin section from a COS - 7 cell expressing dEosFP - tagged cytochrome - C ox - idase import sequence . Higher magnification PALM ( E ) , TEM ( F ) , and overlay ( G ) images within the box in ( B ) reveal that these matrix re - porter molecules extend up to , but not into , the È 20 - nm outer mito - chondrial membrane . The molecular distribution across two mitochon - dria along lines 1 and 2 in PALM image ( E ) are compared in ( H ) to the TEM signal along lines 3 and 4 in ( F ) across the same mitochondria .

Under even higher magnification ( inset , Fig . 4D ) , numerous short filaments are observed . These may be independent structures fixed in the process of assembly , or they may be part of a larger , continuous 3D network only partially revealed by the short extent of the evanescent excitation field . In whole cells , PALM with TIRF excitation is well suited to studies of proteins bound to the plasma membrane , such as the dEosFP - fused Gag protein of human immunodeficiency virus 1 imaged by TIRF and PALM in Fig . 4 , E and F , respectively . Gag , a retroviral protein that medi - ates the assembly of virus - like particles ( VLPs ) , is revealed by PALM in various stages of organi - zation : voids ( arrows marked V ) , one high - density region ( arrow R ) , and several tight clusters probably indicative of budding VLPs ( arrows marked P , and magnified inset of Fig . 4F ) . In the future , PALM should benefit from im - provements in and additions to the palette of available PA - FPs , as well as from the discovery of means to modify the PA - FP environment to en - hance photostability ( 13 ) and suppress blinking . Recently , we demonstrated photoactivation in PALM through ultraviolet - induced uncaging ( 28 ) of fluorophores ( fig . S10 ) which , when combined with immunolabeling or other devel - oping methods to achieve high - specificity intra - cellular protein labeling ( 27 , 29 ) , might offer a different avenue to improved localization pre - cision and faster frame rates , given that a broad spectrum of high - brightness caged fluorophores is potentially available . Algorithmically , additional well - localized mol - ecules might be mined from the data if better means are found to unambiguously collate the multiple photon bursts from blinking molecules . Possible improvements to the fitting algorithm to achieve higher localization accuracy should also be explored . Although most of the observed mol - ecules are well represented by a circularly sym - metric Gaussian PSF , possible systematic position errors due to chromophore orientation , pixel non - uniformity , and chromatic aberration deserve closer attention . Perhaps most importantly , position error due to background nonuniformity within the molecular fitting window needs to be addressed , particularly when the number of inactivated mole - cules contributing to this background is high . Experimentally , multiple angles and polariza - tions of TIRF excitation may eventually permit the precise determination of the xyz position and dipole orientation for fixed PA - FP molecules within the evanescent field . Standing wave TIRF could provide an excitation PSF of width È l exc / 6 , improving localization precision for a given photon count . Bulk cellular autofluorescence complicates the extension of PALM to 3D , but the improved single - molecule sensitivity predicted for a proposed optical lattice microscope ( 30 ) may help . However , the most promising path to 3D may involve cryogenic PALM of vitrified cells , due to the narrow molecular line widths , large cross - sections , and improved stability expected ( 8 ) . On the other hand , the ambient , TIRF - based PALM system demonstrated here has the ad - vantage of simplicity , requiring only a TIRF - capable microscope with appropriate lasers , filters , and EMCCD camera , as well as basic acquisition , localization , and image rendering software . As such , it could be widely adopted in short order for the near - molecular resolution imaging of specified proteins for in vitro preparations and fixed cells . References and Notes 1 . J .
