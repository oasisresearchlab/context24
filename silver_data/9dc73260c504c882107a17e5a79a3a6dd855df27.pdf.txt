xxiii SIGCSE 2003 Addresses Keynote Address : Expanding the Audience for Computer Science Eric Roberts Department of Computer Science Stanford University eroberts @ cs . stanford . edu According to prevailing labor projections , the demand for well - trained computer scientists and software developers will continue to grow in the coming years , in spite of the dot - com collapse . For the most part , the people who fill these positions - - and particularly those that require high levels of creativity and independence of thought - - will be trained by colleges and universities . Unfortunately , many highly talented students never investigate computer science as an academic option , either because they have not been exposed to what computing has to offer or because they feel themselves outside of the traditional computer science milieu . As computer science teachers , we have a collective responsibility to ensure that this discipline remains open to the widest possible range of students . In this talk , I will describe several strategies and tactics for achieving that goal .
