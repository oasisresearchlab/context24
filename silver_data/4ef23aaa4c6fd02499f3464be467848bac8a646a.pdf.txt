However , in the crystal structure of the inactive complex , they are too far apart to form such a nucleus . Here , we show using EM that yeast and bovine Arp2 / 3 complexes exist in a distribution among open , intermediate and closed conformations . The crystal structure docks well into the open conformation . The activator WASp binds at the cleft between Arp2 and Arp3 , and all WASp - bound complexes are closed . The inhibitor coronin binds near the p35 subunit , and all coronin - bound complexes are open . Activating and loss - of - function mutations in the p35 subunit skew conformational distribution in opposite directions , closed and open , respectively . We conclude that WASp stabilizes p35 - dependent closure of the complex , holding Arp2 and Arp3 closer together to nucleate an actin filament . The rapid assembly of actin filament networks is required for cell loco - motion , endocytosis , and the intracellular motility of vesicles , organelles and specific pathogens . At the heart of these processes is the evolution - arily conserved seven - subunit Arp2 / 3 complex , which directly nucleates actin assembly 1 . The complex is thought to seed actin polymerization by forming a pseudo actin dimer composed of its two actin - related pro - tein subunits , Arp2 and Arp3 . However , by itself , the Arp2 / 3 complex is relatively inactive , and efficient actin nucleation requires its interactions with the WA / VCA domain of a nucleation - promoting factor ( NPF ) , such as SCAR / WASp family proteins and / or a pre - existing ( mother ) actin filament . These signals stimulate the Arp2 / 3 complex to nucleate the polymerization of a new ( daughter ) filament 1 . This tight regulation of the activity of the Arp2 / 3 complex is thought to be critical in vivo for controlling the spatial and temporal assembly of cellular actin filament networks . The precise mechanism by which the Arp2 / 3 complex is activated remains poorly understood . The crystal structure of the Arp2 / 3 complex shows the inactive form , in which there is a large separation between the Arp2 and Arp3 subunits that prohibits formation of a pseudo actin dimer 2 . This observation has led to the proposal that NPFs may induce major structural rearrangements in the Arp2 / 3 complex to bring the Arp2 and Arp3 subunits closer together 2 . However , experimental evi - dence for such conformational changes has been limited . Chemical crosslinking of free and NPF - bound Arp2 / 3 complex reveals differences consistent with conformational changes 3 , 4 . In addition , a comparison of the structures of free Arp2 / 3 complex and Arp2 / 3 complex at fila - ment branchpoints , as determined by cryo - EM and three - dimensional reconstruction 5 , suggests a conformational change coupled to branch - ing . The change occurs in a region of the complex located at the base of the daughter filament . Based on the assumption that Arp2 and Arp3 sub - units are located at this end , it was suggested that these changes involve rearrangement of at least one of the actin - related protein subunits ( Arp2 or Arp3 , or both ) . However , it was not possible to make a more detailed interpretation because of the resolution of these reconstructions , which precluded specific subunit assignments . As a result , it has not been possible to define the subunit rearrangements that occur upon activation of Arp2 / 3 complex or to visualize possible transition states . One limitation of crystallography is that it usually provides the struc - ture of only a single conformation of a protein , when most proteins in solution exist in dynamic equilibrium among several conformations . Here , we used EM and single - particle averaging to image purified yeast and bovine Arp2 / 3 complexes , because this technique has the potential to detect distinct classes of structures for a protein . We show that the Arp2 / 3 complex exists in several conformations . The inactive Arp2 / 3 complex is stabilized in an open conformation , and WASp - mediated closure of the gap between Arp2 and Arp3 primes the complex for actin nucleation . RESULTSArp2 / 3 complex exists in several conformations Using EM and single - particle averaging techniques , we imaged purified wild - type Saccharomyces cerevisiae Arp2 / 3 complex ( Fig . 1 ) .

Classification of S . cerevisiae Arp2 / 3 complex particles revealed three distinct conformations , for which projection maps were generated ( Fig . 1d – f ) . The number of distinct classes that contained the vast majority of particles did not depend on the number of classes gener - ated , suggesting that only three conformations existed . This does not rule out the possibility that additional conformations exist but suggests that the three identified are the predominant stable species . The resolution of the projection structures was ∼ 25 Å , estimated by the Fourier ring correlation method ( data not shown ) . We refer to these conformations as ‘open , ’ ‘intermediate’ and ‘closed , ’ on the basis of differences in the size of the major cleft ( arrow in Fig . 1d ) . The three structures were distributed in approximately equal ratios ( see below ) . For comparison , we created a projection map from the crystal struc - ture of inactive bovine Arp2 / 3 complex 2 ( Fig . 1a – c ) and found that it closely resembles our open and intermediate conformations ( Fig . 1d , e ) . This resemblance is not due to bias introduced into the alignment , because the crystal structure was never used as a reference in processing the data . We could not compare the structures determined here to those previously obtained by cryo - EM 5 , because there are no recognizable features in the cryo - EM structures that align with the crystal structure or our negatively stained structures . The resolution of our experimental projections was notable given the relatively small size of the Arp2 / 3 complex ( 231 kDa ) and allowed us to assign the positions of each subunit when compared with the crystal structure . The region of the complex that undergoes the most notice - able changes among open , intermediate and closed conformations is located near the Arp2 , Arp3 and p18 subunits . The dynamic nature of this region may help to explain why half of Arp2 was disordered and absent from the crystal structure , and a mass that appears in this location in our intermediate and closed conformations may represent that part of Arp2 . The difference map created by subtracting the open from the intermediate conformations suggests that Arp2 moves from the bottom center of the projection in Figure 1d toward the bottom right , whereas Arp3 drops toward Arp2 , resulting in a loss of mass from the center right ( Fig . 1g ) . The difference map created by subtracting the intermediate from the closed conformation revealed a further ‘tuck’ of Arp2 , Arp3 and p18 ( bovine p21 ) from the periphery toward the center of the complex ( Fig . 1h ) . The difference map created by subtracting the open from the closed conformation reveals net shifts in the positions of Arp2 , Arp3 and p18 , resulting in compaction of the complex ( Fig . 1i ) . We observed little or no change in the positions of the other four subunits . To verify that the conformational differences characterizing the open , intermediate and closed states are not merely the result of different views of the complex in the electron microscope , we derived three - dimensional maps for each conformation , aligned them to each other and calculated difference maps . The Arp2 / 3 crystal structure docks well into the three - dimensional map of the open but not the closed state ( Fig . 1j , k ) , consistent with the two - dimensional results . The three - dimensional difference map between the open and closed state ( Fig . 1l ) confirmed that the primary change occurs in the positions of Arp2 , Arp3 and p18 . The structure of WASp - bound Arp2 / 3 complex To address how NPFs influence Arp2 / 3 complex conformation , we imaged Arp2 / 3 complex in the presence of full - length yeast WASp ( Las17 ) , which has a stronger Arp2 / 3 - complex binding affinity ( data not shown ) and nucleation - promoting activity 6 than its WA / VCA domain alone . Four classes of particles were detected , as opposed to three classes in the absence of WASp . All of the particles in the new class ( 35 % of total particles ) were in a conformation most similar to the closed conforma - tion and had an additional mass near the protrusion formed by Arp3 and p18 ( Fig . 2 ) . We interpret this new class as WASp - bound Arp2 / 3 complex . The remaining 65 % of particles aligned well with the previously calcu - lated open , intermediate and closed conformations and probably repre - sent free complex . The difference map generated by subtracting the free closed structure from the new structure shows that the additional mass ( arrows , Fig . 2b , c ) resides at a position on or between Arp2 and Arp3 . One possibility is that this mass results solely from marked rearrange - ments of the Arp2 and Arp3 subunits themselves , but because we never observed such a mass in the three structures of free Arp2 / 3 complex , we favor the interpretation that the additional mass comes from WASp itself . Furthermore , the location of this mass is consistent with the chemical crosslinking of WASp to p40 , Arp2 and Arp3 ( refs . 3 , 4 ) . The new mass is slightly smaller than might be predicted for yeast WASp ( 67 kDa ) and Figure 1 Three different conformations of wild - type Arp2 / 3 complex .

The WASp - bound structure more strongly resembles the free closed conformation than the free open or intermediate conforma - tions , as seen by comparing the difference maps ( Supplementary Fig . 1 online ) . These data are consistent with a model in which WASp binds near Arp2 and Arp3 and stabilizes the closed conformation . The structure of coronin - bound Arp2 / 3 complex We next imaged Arp2 / 3 complex in the presence of its direct inhibi - tor , coronin 7 . A total of 69 % of particles aligned well with the open , intermediate and closed conformations , again probably representing free complex . The remaining particles fell into classes that were most similar to the open conformation but showed additional density near the p35 subunit . Because these classes were visible only in the presence of coronin , they probably represent coronin - bound Arp2 / 3 complex ( Fig . 2e ) . The detection of these new open structures is the opposite result from imaging WASp and Arp2 / 3 complex , which produced a new closed structure . The difference map ( Fig . 2f ) generated by subtracting the free open structure ( Fig . 2d ) from the most prominent of the new open coronin - bound structures showed a new mass ∼ 40 Å in diameter ( arrows , Fig . 2e , f ) that resides ∼ 20 Å from the p35 subunit . This mass probably represents the largest domain of coronin , its 40 - kDa WD - repeat region , which is predicted to form a β - propeller structure . This domain does not participate in interactions with Arp2 / 3 complex 7 , so it is not surprising that it does not directly contact the complex . Instead , a short ( 50 - residue ) coiled - coil domain located at the C terminus of coronin has been shown to mediate both the physical association with and inhibition of Arp2 / 3 complex 7 . In the primary structure of yeast coronin , the coiled - coil domain is separated from the β - propeller by a 20 - kDa central region of unknown structure . This segment may account for the 20 - Å spacing of the coronin β - propeller from p35 . The proximity of the visible coronin mass to the p35 subunit is consistent with reported physical interactions between the coiled - coil domain and p35 ( ref . 7 ) . Together , the data indicate that coronin binds near p35 and stabilizes the open conformation of Arp2 / 3 complex to inhibit nucleation activity . Comparison of yeast and bovine Arp2 / 3 complex To address whether Arp2 / 3 complexes from other species have similar conformations to yeast Arp2 / 3 complex , we imaged bovine Arp2 / 3 com - plex . First , we directly compared the actin nucleation activities of bovine and S . cerevisiae Arp2 / 3 complexes . The two were activated equally using a WA / VCA fragment of mammalian WASp ; however , the S . cerevisiae com - plex had a more ‘leaky’ or constitutive activity in the absence of activator compared with bovine Arp2 / 3 complex ( Fig . 3a ) . We then generated single - particle averages of bovine Arp2 / 3 complex and compared them with the averages of yeast Arp2 / 3 complex ( Fig . 3b – g ) . Although its subunits share only ∼ 50 % amino acid sequence identity with their yeast counterparts , the single - particle averages of bovine Arp2 / 3 complex were similar to yeast Arp2 / 3 complex and classified similarly into three conformations : open , intermediate and closed . Consistent with its lower spontaneous nucleation activity , the bovine Arp2 / 3 complex had a skewed conformational distri - bution toward the open state compared with yeast complex , with 60 % of particles open and only 18 % closed . These correlative data further support the assignment of the open conformation as inactive . Role of p35 subunit in activation of Arp2 / 3 complex Activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex is thought to involve interactions both with NPFs and the sides of mother filaments 1 , 8 – 10 , and these sig - nals may be coordinated to act additively , in a specific temporal order , Figure 2 Activated ( WASp - bound ) Arp2 / 3 complex is in the closed conformation and inactive ( coronin - bound ) Arp2 / 3 complex is in the open conformation .

The p35 subunit is not predicted to participate directly in actin nucleation or to bind NPFs . However , p35 is required for structural integrity of the complex and serves as a hub , making direct contacts with the sides of mother filaments , three other subunits in the complex ( p19 , Arp2 and Arp3 ) and the inhibitor coronin 2 , 7 , 8 , 10 , 11 . Thus , p35 is in a prime position to receive several regulatory inputs and relay conformational changes to Arp2 and Arp3 subunits to signal activation or inhibition of nucle - ation . Using a random mutagenesis strategy , we isolated temperature - sensitive alleles of ARC35 , the essential gene in S . cerevisiae that encodes p35 . Sequencing showed that each allele contained five to eight substi - tutions of single amino acid residues ( Supplementary Fig . 2 online ) . We purified Arp2 / 3 complex from the wild - type strain and > 12 arc35 mutant strains ( examples in Fig . 4a ) and compared their actin nucle - ation activities alone and in the presence of full - length yeast WASp ( Fig . 4b – e ) or its WA / VCA domain ( Fig . 4e ) . The actin nucleation activities of the mutants fell into two separate classes , typified by Arc35 - 5 and Arc35 - 6 . Arc35 - 6 is impaired for activation by both full - length WASp and WA frag - ment ( Fig . 4b , e ) . When stimulated by WASp , Arc35 - 6 had the same activity as a three - fold lower concentration of wild - type Arp2 / 3 complex ( Fig . 4b ) . Arc35 - 6 responded similarly to wild - type Arp2 / 3 complex to increasing WASp concentrations ( Supplementary Fig . 3 online ) , suggesting that it does not sim - ply have reduced affinity for WASp . In contrast , a nucleation - impaired mutation in the Arp2 subunit , which is predicted to bind to WASp , is rescued by elevating WASp concentrations in vivo and in vitro , consistent with reduced affinity for WASp ( J . D’Agostino , Brandeis University , and B . G . , unpublished results ) . In contrast to Arc35 - 6 , Arc35 - 5 had pronounced leaky or constitu - tive actin nucleation activity in the absence of any NPF . Furthermore , Arc35 - 5 was more strongly activated than wild - type Arp2 / 3 complex by WA fragment , but not by WASp ( Fig . 4c – e ) . Arc35 - 5 , in the absence of any NPF , had activity comparable to a ten - fold higher concentration of wild - type Arp2 / 3 complex ( Fig . 4d ) . Our preparations contained no contaminating WASp ( Supplementary Fig . 4 online ) . These observa - tions demonstrate that mutations in Arc35 - 5 partially mimic activated Arp2 / 3 complex , whereas mutations in Arc35 - 6 partially impair respon - siveness to WASp , but not because of defects in NPF binding . We compared the structures of Arp2 / 3 complex isolated in two inde - pendent preparations each from wild - type , arc35 - 5 and arc35 - 6 strains . The abundance of intermediate conformation was constant within the error margins for wild type and both mutants . However , the abundance of open and closed conformations differed substantially among Arc35 - 6 ( loss of function ) , Arc35 ( wild type ) and Arc35 - 5 ( constitutively active ) ( Fig . 5a ) . The prevalence of the open conformation in Arc35 - 6 supports further our assignment of this conformation as inactive . The prevalence of the closed conformation in Arc35 - 5 supports further our assignment of this conformation as primed for activation . It is not surprising that the arc35 mutants we isolated from our temperature - sensitive screen are only partially skewed toward the open or closed conformations , because mutations causing a more severe bias would probably be lethal in vivo . DISCUSSION We draw three major conclusions from our data . First , the Arp2 / 3 complex is in equilibrium among several conformations ranging from open to closed . Second , the p35 subunit has an important role in regulating transitions between the open and closed conformations . Third , the open conforma - tion represents an inactive state , and transition to the closed conformation primes the complex for actin nucleation . These activity assignments for the open and closed conformations are supported by several observations : ( i ) 100 % of Arp2 / 3 - complex molecules bound by the activator WASp are closed ; ( ii ) 100 % of Arp2 / 3 - complex molecules bound by the inhibitor coro - nin are open ; ( iii ) the inactive crystal structure of bovine Arp2 / 3 complex docks well into our two - dimensional and three - dimensional reconstruc - tions of the open but not the closed conformation ; ( iv ) in the absence of WASp , bovine Arp2 / 3 complex has reduced spontaneous actin nucleation activity compared with yeast Arp2 / 3 complex , and a corresponding skewed distribution toward the open conformation ; ( v ) inactivating mutants in the p35 subunit of the Arp2 / 3 complex show a shifted distribution of particles toward the open conformation , whereas activating mutants show a shifted distribution toward the closed conformation . In our model , the p35 subunit has a pivotal role in relaying activa - tion signals to other subunits in the complex . This is demonstrated in two ways : first , different mutations in this subunit can have opposite effects on activity and conformation . Second , coronin binds near p35 and shifts 100 % of Arp2 / 3 - complex molecules to which it is bound into the open conformation ( Fig . 5a ) . At present , it remains unclear Figure 4 Actin nucleation activities of mutant and wild - type Arp2 / 3 complexes .

However , one possibility is that signals are relayed through the long C - terminal helix of p35 , which extends toward Arp2 in the crystal structure 2 . In fact , the contacts between p35 and Arp2 may be even more extensive , because a considerable stretch of the p35 C terminus is missing from the crystal structure ( 16 amino acids of bovine p35 and a corresponding 27 residues of S . cerevisiae p35 ) . The p35 sub - unit also is implicated in binding to the sides of filaments 8 , 10 , 11 , and filament - side binding contributes to WA / VCA - induced activation 9 , 10 , 12 . Thus , the mutations in Arc35 - 5 and Arc35 - 6 may partially mimic the filament - bound and filament - free conformations of Arp2 / 3 com - plex , respectively . This proposal is consistent with our actin assembly kinetics results . Arc35 - 5 remains more active than wild - type Arp2 / 3 complex when stimulated by the WA / VCA domain but not WASp ( Fig . 4e ) , suggesting that WA / VCA - independent aspects of WASp activation are constitutive in this mutant . A putative actin filament – binding domain in the N terminus of WASp 13 , 14 may recruit Arp2 / 3 complex to filament sides , masking the effects of Arc35 - 5 . Our data suggest an actin nucleation mechanism in which WASP and filament - bound p35 stabilize the closed conformation of Arp2 / 3 com - plex , holding Arp2 and Arp3 close together to promote actin nucleation ( Fig . 5b ) . Our model for closure of the Arp2 / 3 complex is consistent with reported differences in the chemical crosslinking patterns of free and NPF - bound Arp2 / 3 complex 3 , 4 , with differences in the cryo - EM structures of free Arp2 / 3 complex and Arp2 / 3 complex at filament branchpoints 5 , and with NMR and photo crosslinking data showing that the central acidic ( CA ) region of WASp binds to Arp2 , Arp3 and p18 ( M . Rosen , University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas , personal communication ) . Our results also agree with the gen - eral predictions of Robinson and colleagues 2 but show that the subunit movements are more complex than the suggested simple rigid - body rotation . It should be emphasized that although closure of the complex represents a key step in the activation mechanism , it is not sufficient to promote strong actin nucleation . In addition to stabilizing the closed conformation of the Arp2 / 3 complex , WASp must provide an actin monomer to the barbed ends of the Arp subunits 1 , and WASP and / or actin binding are required to alter the nucleotide - bound state of Arp subunits to promote actin nucleation 15 – 18 . Future structural analyses of the Arp2 / 3 complex in different nucleotide - bound states , and bound to both WASp and an actin monomer , should help clarify the precise mechanism for actin nucleation . METHODS Generation of arc35 mutant strains . A centromere - based plasmid ( YEPlac211 ; ref . 19 ) containing genomic DNA 125 base pairs ( bp ) upstream to 500 bp down - stream of the ARC35 open reading frame ( ORF ) was mutagenized by error - prone PCR and transformed into an arc35 ∆ strain carrying pLYS2 - ARC35 . Transformants were plated on α - aminoadipic acid to select against pLYS2 - ARC35 . Mutant plasmids were rescued , and mutagenized ARC35 genomic fragments were subcloned into XbaI and PstI sites of pRS305 and integrated at the LEU2 locus of strain BGY848 ( MATa , leu2 , ura3 , his3 , ARP2 : TEV3xHA : HISMX , arc35 ∆ : KANMX , pRS316 - ARC35 ) . URA3 - marked pRS316 - ARC35 was removed by plat - ing transformants on 5 - fluoroorotic acid . The ARC35 ORF was amplified from these strains by PCR and sequenced . Protein purification . Arp2 / 3 complex was purified from strains expressing mutant Arc35 alleles as their only source of Arc35 ( described earlier ) and Arp2 tagged with a TEV protease site followed by three copies of the hemagglutinin ( HA ) epitope as their only source of Arp2 . Frozen yeast were lysed as described 6 and thawed in a 1 : 1 ( w / v ) ratio of HEK buffer ( 20 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 5 , 1 mM EDTA , 50 mM KCl ) with protease inhibitors 6 and 0 . 5 % ( v / v ) Triton X - 100 . Lysate ( 18 ml ) was cleared for 20 min at 80 , 000 r . p . m . ( 260 , 000 g ) in a TLA100 . 3 rotor ( Beckman ) and incubated for 1 . 5 h with HA antibody - coated beads 6 . Beads were washed with 15 ml HEK + 0 . 5 % ( v / v ) Triton X - 100 , 15 ml HEK + 450 mM KCl and 15 ml HEK , then resuspended in 200 µ l HEK and 3 units of rTEV protease ( Invitrogen ) . After 1 h of incubation at room temperature , 3 additional units of rTEV were added and proteins were incubated again for 1 h . The supernatant was removed and flash - frozen in liquid N 2 . rTEV has no effect on actin polymeriza - tion mediated by Arp2 / 3 complex 6 . Bovine Arp2 / 3 complex and GST - VCA 20 , yeast coronin 7 , full - length yeast WASp ( Las17 ) 6 and its WA fragment 21 were puri - fied as described . Rabbit skeletal muscle actin ( unlabeled and pyrene - labeled ) was purchased from Cytoskeleton . Actin assembly kinetics . Actin assembly reactions contained 3 µ M rabbit skeletal muscle actin ( 1 % pyrene - labeled ) and were carried out in a PTI spectrofluo - rometer . Monomeric actin ( 22 . 5 µ M ) was mixed with the relevant proteins at the indicated concentrations and added to initiation salts ( final concentration F buffer : 10 mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 , 0 . 2 mM DTT , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 100 mM KCl , 0 . 5 mM ATP , 2 mM MgCl 2 ) . The rate of polymerization was calculated from the slope of assembly curves at 50 % polymerization . EM and single - particle analysis . Preparations of Arp2 / 3 complex were diluted to 0 . 25 µ M with HEK and applied to glow - discharged carbon - coated copper 400 - mesh grids . Excess protein solution was blotted away , and specimens were negatively contrasted with 0 . 75 % ( w / v ) uranyl formate in water ( yeast Arp2 / 3 , free and bound to WASp ) or with 1 % ( w / v ) uranyl acetate in water ( yeast Arp2 / 3 bound to coronin and bovine Arp2 / 3 ) . Grids were examined in a Philips CM12 electron microscope at 120 kV under low - dose conditions . Negatives were taken at 45 , 000 × magnification and an image defocus of 1 . 8 µ m , and scanned on a Zeiss SCAI scanner , using a pixel size of 7 µ m . After 3 × 3 pixel averaging , the pixel size on the specimen was 4 . 67 Å pixel – 1 . A typical field is shown in Supplementary Figure 5 online .

Next , there is a further closure of the gap between Arp2 and Arp3 by a movement of Arp2 toward Arp3 , and possibly a small movement of Arc18 toward the center of the gap , creating the closed conformation . WASp is shown binding to Arp2 and Arp3 , and possibly also to p40 , stabilizing the closed conformation . Coronin is shown binding to p35 , stabilizing the open conformation .

A total of 3 , 192 particles were processed using the IMAGIC package 22 . Classification into six classes yielded three distinct classes that contained the majority of particles representing three conformations of the protein . The three remaining classes each contained ≤ 5 % of the particles from the data set , showed no similarity to the Arp2 / 3 complex crystal structure 2 and were discarded . The three primary classes were used as the new references for multiple - reference alignment of the data set , yielding improved classes . A second set of 3 , 735 particles was processed independently under identi - cal conditions , giving classes that were virtually indistinguishable from the first data set . The second data set was used to estimate the errors in the distributions determined for the three conformations of the complex . Difference maps were calculated after scaling each projection structure to give the same variance and zero mean . The Fourier ring correlation 23 , calculated between projection struc - tures that each included one - half of the data , was used to estimate the resolution of the projection structures . The resolution of all structures was estimated at 25 Å , corresponding approximately to the first zero of the contrast transfer function of the electron microscope . To image Arp2 / 3 complex bound to WASp or coronin , the complex and WASp or coronin were mixed at a 1 : 1 molar ratio and applied to copper 400 - mesh grids as before . For WASp , manual selection from 18 negatives yielded 1 , 408 images in one data set and 1 , 756 images in a second data set . Particles were classified as before , yielding only four strong classes . Three of these classes were virtu - ally indistinguishable from the previously obtained classes . The difference maps between the closed conformation of unbound Arp2 / 3 complex and the WASp - bound complex , and the open conformation and the coronin - bound complex were calculated as described earlier . Three - dimensional reconstructions of the open , intermediate and closed states were determined using the random conical tilt method 24 , 25 , as implemented in the SPIDER 25 . Particles were selected from images of specimens tilted at 0 ° and 45 ° . The data sets contained 1 , 025 tilt pairs for closed conformation , 988 tilt pairs for open conformation and 762 tilt pairs for the intermediate conforma - tion . Refinement and correction for the contrast transfer function of the elec - tron microscope were done using FREALIGN 26 , resulting in three - dimensional structures with a resolution of 25 Å . The three - dimensional difference maps were calculated using IMAGIC 22 after alignment of the structures to each other by maximization of a correlation coefficient . All three - dimensional maps were visualized using the molecular viewer CHIMERA 27 . The Arp2 / 3 crystal structure was docked into the three - dimensional map of the open conformation using SITUS 28 ; the best match gave a correlation coefficient of 0 . 3 .
