The attachment of the plasma membrane to the underlying actomyosin cortex has been proposed to be important for cellular processes involving membrane deformation . However , little is known about the actual function of membrane - to - cortex attachment ( MCA ) in cell protrusion formation and migration , in particular in the context of the developing embryo . Here , we use a multidisciplinary approach to study MCA in zebrafish mesoderm and endoderm ( mesendoderm ) germ layer progenitor cells , which migrate using a combination of different protrusion types , namely , lamellipodia , filopodia , and blebs , during zebrafish gastrulation . By interfering with the activity of molecules linking the cortex to the membrane and measuring resulting changes in MCA by atomic force microscopy , we show that reducing MCA in mesendoderm progenitors increases the proportion of cellular blebs and reduces the directionality of cell migration . We propose that MCA is a key parameter controlling the relative proportions of different cell protrusion types in mesendoderm progenitors , and thus is key in controlling directed migration during gastrulation .

Introduction During development of the vertebrate body , progenitor cells must migrate from the site at which they are specified to the site where they will eventually form the different body parts . Cell migration is the direct result of mechanical forces mediating cell shape changes and cell - substrate translocation [ 1 ] . Thus , the study of cellular mechanics is a prerequisite for understanding cell migration [ 2 – 4 ] . In recent years , most studies of cell migration have focused on its molecular control [ 5 ] . To fully understand migration , the molecules controlling cell migration must be linked to the mechanics underlying this process . The attachment of the plasma membrane to the cytoskeleton ( membrane - to - cortex attachment [ MCA ] ) has been proposed to be an important mechanical parameter involved in cell shape changes , such as protrusion formation [ 6 ] . MCA is thought to modulate the protrusive activity of cells by providing resistance to the flow of plasma membrane into the expanding protrusion [ 7 ] . Several molecules are involved in the regulation of MCA , including Ezrin / Radixin / Moesin ( ERM ) proteins and class 1 myosins [ 8 , 9 ] . Studies in mice , Drosophila melanogaster , Caenorhabditis elegans , and cultured cells have shown that ERM proteins are critical for cell shape control during mitotic cell rounding , cell polarization , cell migration , and cell - cell adhesion [ 10 – 14 ] . Likewise , class 1 myosins in both single - celled eukaryotes and metazoans have been implicated in various morphogenetic processes , ranging from actin polymerization and microvilli formation to cell motility [ 15 ] . In zebrafish , ERM proteins , and in particular Ezrin , are essential for tissue morphogenesis during gastrulation ( [ 16 ] and Figure S1 ; for methods see Text S1 ) , while the role of zebrafish class 1 myosins has not yet been studied . It remains unclear whether the functions of ERM proteins and class 1 myosins in cell and tissue morphogenesis are the direct consequence of MCA modulation , or are linked to other functions of these proteins [ 15 , 17 ] . To analyze the role of MCA in cell protrusion formation and migration in vivo , we turned to zebrafish anterior axial mesendoderm progenitor cells ( prechordal plate progenitors ) , which during the course of gastrulation migrate from the germ ring margin , where they are specified , towards the animal pole of the gastrula using a combination of different protrusion types [ 18 , 19 ] . Several signaling pathways , including PDGF / PI3K and Wnt / PCP signaling , have been suggested to control protrusion formation and migration of prechordal plate progenitors [ 18 , 19 ] . PLoS Biology | www . plosbiology . org 1 November 2010 | Volume 8 | Issue 11 | e1000544 Recently , we showed that ERM proteins are phosphorylated and thus activated in prechordal plate progenitor cells , and are required for prechordal plate morphogenesis ( [ 16 ] and Figure S1 ; for methods see Text S1 ) , alluding to the possibility that ERM proteins modulate prechordal plate cell morphogenesis by regulating MCA . Here , we show that MCA is a critical mechanical parameter determining the proportion of different protrusion types formed by prechordal plate progenitors , and thereby controlling directed migration during zebrafish gastrulation . Results To test whether MCA can be modulated in prechordal plate cells by interfering with ERM protein activity , we developed an assay for measuring MCA using atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) , and compared MCA in isolated control and ERM - deficient prechordal plate cells . Control cells were obtained from embryos expressing the Nodal - ligand Cyclops ( Cyc ) , previously shown to induce prechordal plate progenitor cell fate and activate ERM proteins [ 16 , 20 ] . ERM - deficient cells were obtained from embryos expressing Cyc in combination with either a dominant negative non - phosphorylatable version of ezrin ( DN Ezrin T564A ; [ 21 ] ) or a combination of morpholinos ( MOs ) targeted against ezrin and moesin - a to inactivate ERM protein function ( [ 16 ] ; details about MO and controls in Materials and Methods ) . To quantify MCA , we estimated the adhesion energy density between the plasma membrane and the subjacent cytoskeleton ( W 0 ; Figure 1A and 1B ; [ 22 , 23 ] ) by measuring via single cell force spectroscopy [ 24 ] the force needed to extrude single lipid - membrane nanotubes ( or tethers ) from the cell plasma membrane . Various models of tether extrusion have shown that the force required to hold a tether at a constant height ( static tether force , F 0 ; see Figure 1A and 1B ) depends on the membrane bending rigidity ( k ) , the plasma membrane surface tension ( s ) , and the energy density of MCA ( W 0 ; [ 22 , 23 ] ) : F 0 ~ 2 p 2 s z W 0 ð Þ k ð Þ 1 = 2 ð 1 Þ where s + W 0 is also called apparent surface tension of the membrane ( T app ; [ 22 ] ) . By extruding tethers from control and ERM - deficient prechordal plate cells , we found that the static tether force F 0 was significantly reduced in ERM - deficient cells ( Figure 1C ; Table S1 ) . We then used F 0 to calculate the reduc - tion of apparent tension T app in ERM - deficient cells ( T app = 18 m N ? m 2 1 , median ) compared to control cells ( T app = 46 m N ? m 2 1 , median ) , using a previously determined value for k , which we assumed was unchanged upon ERM depletion ( [ 25 ] ; details in Materials and Methods ) . To estimate the corresponding decrease in MCA energy ( W 0 ) , we then measured the plasma membrane tension s by extruding tethers from cells treated with Latrunculin A ( LatA ) to depolymerize the actin cortex , where W 0 is negligible and thus T app > s [ 26 ] . We found T app to be strongly reduced in LatA - treated cells ( T app > 2 . 5 m N ? m 2 1 > s ) , indicating that s is small compared to W 0 and contributes very little to T app ( W 0 > T app ) . Using this value of s , we calculated W 0 and found it to be strongly reduced upon ERM inactivation in prechordal plate cells ( Figure 1D ) . Inactivating ERM proteins is expected to result in a decrease in the number of molecules cross - linking the cortex to the membrane ( cross - linkers ) . To analyze whether the density of cross - linkers is indeed reduced in ERM - deficient prechordal plate cells , we extruded tethers at varying velocities in control and ERM - deficient cells ( Figure 1E and 1F ; [ 22 , 27 ] ) . The tether pulling force has to counteract the friction of the cross - linkers against lipid bilayer flowing into the tether , and increases with increasing pulling velocities ( Figure 1G ) . A recent model has related pulling force – velocity profiles to the density of cross - linkers and the lipid bilayer viscosity ( [ 23 ] ; details in Materials and Methods ) . By measuring the diffusion of a palmitoyl - anchored GFP ( GAP43 - GFP ) within the plasma membrane as a reporter of lipid mobility [ 28 ] , we first verified that the viscosity of the plasma membrane remains unchanged between control and ERM - deficient cells ( Figure S2A – S2F ; details in Text S1 ) . Using a published value for membrane viscosity ( details in Materials and Methods ) , we then deduced the density of membrane - to - cortex cross - linking mole - cules from the fits of the force – velocity profiles . We found that control cells displayed about 600 cross - linking molecules per square micrometer , which corresponds to a 41 - nm lateral separation between molecules on average ( Figure S2G ) . In ERM - deficient cells , the density of cross - linking molecules was strongly reduced ( Figures 1H and S2G ) , indicating that the reduction of W 0 in ERM - deficient cells is caused by a decrease in the density of active cross - linking molecules . Mechanical coupling of the plasma membrane to the underlying actin cortex has been proposed to influence the formation of cellular blebs [ 29 ] . Bleb - like protrusions are a common alternative to lamellipodia during migration in various cell types ranging from primordial germ cells in zebrafish to cancer cells in culture [ 30 , 31 ] . We thus compared protrusion formation in isolated control and ERM - deficient prechordal plate cells expressing membrane - anchored RFP to mark the plasma membrane and Lifeact - GFP to label F - actin [ 32 ] . Isolated control cells on nonadhesive substrates formed only blebs , recognizable by the local detachment of the plasma membrane from the underlying actin cortex ( Figure 2A ; Video S1 ) . Some of these blebs propagated around the cell circumference by asymmetric assembly of the actin cortex at the bleb neck , a behavior previously described as ‘‘circus movements’’ [ 33 ] . In contrast , ERM - deficient Author Summary Cell migration , like any event involving shape changes , is a mechanical process controlled by complex biochemical pathways . Here , we examine cell migration in developing embryos with a combination of cell biological tools and atomic force microscopy , so as to investigate how cellular mechanical properties control migration . A fundamental step during migration is the formation of a protrusion at the leading edge of the cell . In three - dimensional environments , and particularly in vivo , cells use different protrusion types : spike - like filopodia and flattened lamel - lipodia , whose growth is driven by actin polymerization , and spherical blebs , which grow because of intracellular pressure pushing on the membrane . It is important to understand how the formation of different protrusion types is mechanically and molecularly controlled , and how the different protrusions specifically contribute to migra - tion . We have addressed this using the zebrafish embryo as a model system . We show that reducing the strength of the attachment between the plasma membrane and the underlying cortical network of actin filaments , or increas - ing intracellular pressure , increases the proportion of cellular blebs and reduces the directionality of cell migration . Our work reveals that blebs , lamellipodia , and filopodia are not interchangeable and that the relative proportion of each type of protrusion , under the control of mechanical parameters , determines migration directional - ity during zebrafish gastrulation .

These findings indicate that reduced MCA in isolated ERM - deficient prechordal plate cells correlates with increased blebbing activity . To determine whether similar changes in cell blebbing occur in ERM - deficient prechordal plate cells in vivo , we analyzed prechordal plate progenitor cell protrusion formation in wild type ( wt ) and ERM - deficient embryos expressing membrane - anchored RFP and Lifeact - GFP to distinguish between protrusion types ( Videos S4 , S5 , S6 ) . Three types of cellular protrusions were found in both wt and ERM - deficient prechordal plate progenitors ( Figure 2D and 2E ) : ( i ) spherical protrusions initially devoid of actin , a characteristic of blebs [ 34 ] , ( ii ) sheet - like protrusions containing actin throughout their expansion , resembling lamelli - podia , and ( iii ) long , thin , actin - containing protrusions resembling filopodia . To quantify the formation of these different cellular protrusions in prechordal plate progenitors , we determined the frequencies of their formation , their respective proportions , and the mean time spent by the cell forming each type of protrusion . We found that in ERM - deficient prechordal plate progenitors , the frequency and size of blebs , the mean time spent blebbing , and the proportion of blebs were significantly increased , at the expense of lamellipodia and filopodia ( Figures 2F – 2H and S3 ) . These observations indicate that , similar to isolated cells in culture , ERM - deficient prechordal plate progenitors with reduced MCA in vivo exhibit increased blebbing and that increased blebbing is accompanied by reduced filopodium and lamellipodium formation . Both cortical contractility and MCA have been previously shown to be key mechanical properties controlling bleb formation [ 35 , 36 ] . To exclude that changes in cortical tension rather than in MCA are responsible for the increased blebbing phenotype , we compared tension between control and ERM - deficient cells by colloidal force microscopy using AFM [ 37 ] . We found no significant differences in cell cortex tension between control and ERM - deficient cells ( Figure S4 ) , indicating that increased blebbing of ERM - deficient prechordal plate progenitors is not due to altered contractility . We next asked whether increased blebbing activity in ERM - deficient prechordal plate progenitors with reduced MCA changes their migratory behavior . To analyze the migratory activity of prechordal plate progenitors , we tracked the nuclei of individual progenitors at the leading edge of the prechordal plate marked with Histone - Alexa - 488 from mid to late gastrulation stages ( 8 – 10 h post - fertilization [ hpf ] ; Figure 3A ; Video S7 ) . While the instantaneous speed of the cells remained largely unchanged , we found a significant decrease in the directional persistence and thus net speed of prechordal plate progenitor cell migration in ERM - deficient embryos ( Figure 3B – 3D ) . This suggests that increased blebbing activity in ERM - deficient prechordal plate progenitors with reduced MCA leads to reduced net movement speed and directionality . To determine whether ERM proteins function cell - autono - mously in mesendoderm progenitors to modulate cell migration , we co - transplanted single mesendoderm control cells ( expressing Cyc , which activates ERM proteins ; [ 16 ] ) with ERM - deficient cells ( expressing Cyc in combination with ezrin - MO to inactivate ERM proteins ) into the lateral side of MZ oep mutant embryos lacking most of their endogenous mesendoderm progenitors [ 38 ] . Under these conditions , transplanted cells only rarely interact with their neighbors and mostly undergo single cell migration [ 39 ] . We then tracked the movement of the cell nuclei from mid to late gastrulation stages ( 6 – 10 hpf ; Figure 3E ; Video S8 ) . Similar to the Figure 2 .

This suggests that ERM proteins cell - autonomously modulate mesendoderm progenitor cell migration . We found that in ERM - deficient cells , reduced MCA correlates with increased blebbing and that increased blebbing correlates with reduced movement directionality , which suggests that these phenotypes are functionally linked . To test whether the observed changes in cell blebbing and migration are caused by the reduction in MCA rather than by potential changes in other ERM - controlled activities , we reduced MCA independent of ERM proteins . To reduce MCA in prechordal plate progenitors , we injected a MO targeted against myosin1b - like2 ( details about MO and controls in Materials and Methods ) to interfere with the activity of Myosin1b , which has been previously associated with regulating MCA [ 9 ] . Similar to ERM - deficient cells , Myosin1b - deficient mesendoderm cells exhibited reduced MCA , increased blebbing , and reduced movement directionality and net speed both within the prechordal plate and as single cells transplanted in MZ oep mutant embryos ( Figures 4A – 4G and S5 ; Video S9 ) . This supports our suggestion that reducing MCA is sufficient to enhance mesendoderm cell blebbing and interfere with movement directionality and net speed , and that these phenotypes are functionally linked . We next sought to test whether increased cell blebbing leads to the observed reduced movement directionality or whether these phenotypes are independent consequences of reduced MCA . To do so , we analyzed prechordal plate progenitor cell movement directionality when cell blebbing is increased but MCA is not reduced . To increase cell blebbing without reducing MCA , we injected a MO targeted against myosin phosphatase , target subunit 2 ( myop - MO ) , which has previously been shown to promote the Figure 3 .

MyoP - deficient prechordal plate pro - genitor cells showed increased cortex tension , as well as increased blebbing activity , reduced formation of lamellipodia and filopodia , and increased MCA ( Figures 4H – 4K and S6 ; Video S10 ) . As in ERM - and Myosin1b - deficient cells , enhanced blebbing activity of MyoP - deficient mesendoderm cells , both within the prechordal plate and as single cells transplanted in MZ oep mutant embryos , was accompanied by a significant reduction in the directional persistence and net speed of their migration , while the instanta - neous speed of the cells did not change ( Figure 4L – 4N ) . This indicates that increased cell blebbing leads to reduced movement directionality and net speed in mesendoderm progenitors . Discussion We have shown that reducing MCA in prechordal plate progenitors by interfering with the function of ERM proteins and class 1 myosins leads to increased bleb formation , at the expense of filopodia and lamellipodia , and that this increased proportion of blebs leads to less directed migration during gastrulation . These findings indicate that MCA is a key mechanical parameter controlling the protrusive and migratory activity of prechordal plate progenitor cells during gastrulation . The mechanical coupling of the plasma membrane to the underlying actin cortex has been proposed to regulate various cellular processes ranging from endocytosis to cell spreading [ 6 ] . Although MCA has been directly measured in cultured cells [ 6 , 22 , 23 ] , very little is known about its actual regulation and function in cell morphogenesis in vivo , in particular in a developmental context . To directly evaluate the function of MCA in migrating prechordal plate progenitors in vivo , we developed a highly sensitive assay system based on AFM and high resolution confocal microscopy . We showed that changes in MCA lead to alterations in prechordal plate progenitor cell protrusion formation and migration . Moreover , to establish a causative relationship between MCA strength and prechordal plate progenitor cell morphogenesis , we showed that similar reductions in MCA due to inactivation of different proteins ( ERM and Myosin1b ) lead to comparable changes in cell morphogenesis . These experiments strongly support a critical function of MCA in cell protrusion formation and directed migration . Our finding that reducing MCA in prechordal plate progenitor cells leads to an increase in the formation of blebs , as compared to lamellipodia and filopodia , suggests that MCA is an important mechanical parameter determining the proportion of different protrusion types formed by migrating cells . Decreasing MCA has previously been suggested to promote the formation of cellular blebs in cultured cells [ 36 ] ; however , the mechanisms of bleb formation are still poorly understood [ 30 ] . Our finding that in both ERM - and Myosin1 - deficient prechordal plate progenitors , reduced MCA leads to enhanced blebbing provides direct experimental evidence for a critical function of MCA in bleb formation during prechordal plate progenitor cell migration . MCA has also been proposed to modulate the extension of lamellipodia [ 7 ] , although the role of MCA in this process in not yet clear . The observation that in Myosin1 - deficient prechordal plate progenitor cells , reduced MCA increases blebbing but leaves the mean time spent forming lamellipodia unaltered ( Figures 4 and S5 ) argues against a major function of MCA in lamellipodium formation in our system . However , as the frequency of lamellipodium formation is reduced in both ERM - and Myosin1 - deficient cells ( Figures S3 and S5 ) , a role of MCA in controlling certain aspects of lamellipodium extension cannot be ruled out . The observation that not only decreasing MCA , but also increasing cortical tension , which raises intracellular pressure , enhances blebbing in prechordal plate progenitors ( Figure 4 ) suggests that the balance between MCA and intracellular pressure controls bleb formation . Interestingly , lowering MCA and / or elevating cortical tension increases not only the frequency but also the size of blebs ( Figures 2 and 4 ) . We have previously shown that cortical tension , and the resulting intracellular pressure , regulate bleb size by directly determining the force driving bleb expansion [ 35 ] . MCA , on the other hand , might control bleb size by regulating the size of the bleb base , which has been shown to correlate with bleb size [ 35 ] and is enlarged upon treatments reducing MCA ( Figure 2 ) . In addition , MCA might influence bleb size by setting the mechanical resistance to membrane flow into the expanding bleb , which in turn may control bleb expansion . Future studies addressing the contribution of cytoplasmic stream - ing , bleb base opening , and membrane flow to the dynamics of bleb growth will help to elucidate the mechanisms by which cortical tension and MCA together control bleb size and frequency . We found that changing the proportions of blebs versus lamellipodia and filopodia by reducing MCA leads to less directed migration of prechordal plate progenitors . This finding indicates that the correct proportion of different protrusion types is critical for directed migration in these cells . Blebs are required for the directed migration of various cell types , including zebrafish primordial germ cells and cancer cells [ 34 , 41 , 42 ] . Studies in the teleost Fundulus heteroclitus have demonstrated that germ layer progenitor cells can also undergo directional migration by blebbing locomotion , suggesting that blebs are sufficient for directional migration [ 43 , 44 ] . Interestingly , these cells change from bleb - to filopodium - and lamellipodium - driven migration during the course of gastrulation , resulting in individual progen - itors often simultaneously forming different protrusion types [ 45 ] . While this suggests that both blebs and lamellipodia / filopodia function in directed progenitor cell migration , it remains unclear whether these different protrusion types are interchangeable or specifically contribute to directed migration . Our finding that the proportion of different protrusion types is critical for the directed deficient embryos ( left panels ) and instantaneous speed , directional persistence , and net speed ratios ( relative to co - transplanted control cells in the same embryo ) of Myosin1b - deficient single lateral mesendoderm cells transplanted into MZ oep mutant embryos ( right panels ) .

Nodal / TGF b signals are thought to be key regulators of mesendoderm cell fate specification and morphogenesis [ 20 ] . Since Nodal signaling is required for ERM phosphorylation and hence activation in mesendoderm progenitors [ 16 ] , it is conceivable that Nodal proteins control mesendoderm protru - sion formation and migration by regulating ERM - dependent MCA . Future studies analyzing the function of Nodal signal - ing in MCA will be needed to elucidate the specific contribu - tion of MCA in Nodal - mediated mesendoderm progenitor morphogenesis . The regulation of MCA is also likely to be important for cell migration in processes other than zebrafish gastrulation . Notably , ERM deregulation has been implicated in tumor metastasis [ 46 ] , raising the possibility that the regulation of MCA is critical for cell protrusion formation and migration during tumor progression and metastasis . Materials and Methods Embryo Staging and Maintenance Zebrafish maintenance was carried out as described in [ 47 ] . Embryos were grown at 31 u C in E3 medium and staged as described in [ 48 ] . mRNA , Morpholino , and Dye Injection mRNA was synthesized as described in [ 49 ] . For tether force measurements wt TL embryos were injected with 100 pg of cyc alone ( control ) or together with a combination of 4 ng of ezrin - UTR - MO [ 16 ] plus 4 ng of moesin - a - MO ( TGGTCTCTTCC - TTCACGAATGTGTC ) or 300 pg of DN Ezrin to generate ERM - deficient cells , 2 ng of myop - MO [ 40 ] to generate MyoP - deficient cells , and 8 ng of myo1b - UTR - MO ( CGAGCAGTGATGTTTT - CACCTCCAT ) to generate Myo1b - deficient cells . For in vitro confocal microscopy , an additional 50 pg of lifeact - GFP plus 100 pg of GPI - RFP were injected in control and ERM - deficient embryos . For in vivo confocal microscopy , wt TL embryos were injected with 50 pg of lifeact - GFP plus 100 pg of GPI - RFP alone ( control ) or together with 250 pg of DN Ezrin ( ERM - deficient ) , 4 ng of ezrin - UTR - MO ( ERM - deficient ) , 3 ng of myop - MO ( MyoP - deficient ) , or 8 ng of myo1b - ATG - MO ( Myo1b - deficient ) . For tracking of prechordal plate cell nuclei , wt embryos were injected with Alexa Fluor - 488 conjugated histone H1 ( H13188 , Invitrogen ) and 100 pg of GPI - RFP . For tracking of cell nuclei in the transplantation experiments , wt donor embryos were injected with 100 pg of cyc together with Alexa Fluor - 488 conjugated histone H1 ( H13188 , Invitrogen ) ( control ) , 100 pg of histoneH2A - zf : : mcherry plus 4 ng of ezrin - UTR - MO ( ERM - deficient ) , 100 pg of histoneH2A - zf : : mcherry plus 3 ng of myop - MO [ 40 ] ( MyoP - deficient ) , or 100 pg of histoneH2A - zf : : mcherry plus 8 ng of myo1b - ATG - MO ( Myo1b - deficient ) . MZ oep host embryos were injected with Dextran Alexa Fluor - 647 ( D22914 , Invitrogen ) . The ezrin - UTR - MO and myop - MO were used and controlled as described in [ 16 ] . As a further control for the ezrin morphant phenotype , we expressed a dominant negative non - phosphoryla - table zebrafish version of ezrin [ 21 ] , resulting in a phenotype similar to that observed in ezrin morphant embryos . The myo1b - ATG - MO was designed according to Gene Tools targeting guidelines against myosin1b - like2 gene . To control the myo1b morphant phenotype , we tested a second myo1b - UTR - MO and a zebrafish dominant negative myosin1b - like2 version truncated as in [ 50 ] , which produced similar prechordal plate progenitor cell blebbing phenotypes as observed with the ATG - MO . We also rescued the myo1b - UTR - MO prechordal plate progenitor cell blebbing phenotype by co - expressing mouse full - length myosin1a mRNA [ 50 ] ( data not shown ) . Confocal Microscopy and Bleb Size Measurement For in vivo experiments , images were obtained with an Andor spinning disc system equipped with a 63 6 / 1 . 2 objective using 488 - nm and 563 - nm laser lines . Frames were captured at 10 - s intervals for 15 min between 8 and 10 hpf . The temperature was kept constant at 28 u C . For in vitro experiments , cells from Lifeact - and GPI - RFP - expressing embryos were seeded on a BSA - coated glass slide to prevent attachment and imaged using a Leica SP5 inverted microscope equipped with a 63 6 / 1 . 2 lens using 488 - nm and 561 - nm laser lines for 2 min at 2 - s intervals . For bleb size measurements , the projected area of the bleb at its maximal extension was measured using ImageJ and normalized to the projected area of the whole cell . Transplantation Experiments Wt TL and MZ oep mutant donor and host embryos were dechorionated with Pronase ( 2 mg ? ml 2 1 in E2 ) and transferred onto an agarose plate with E3 medium . Two to three cells were taken from control and experimental donor embryos at dome stage ( 5 hpf ) and transplanted into the emerging lateral mesendoderm of a MZ oep dharma : : GFP host embryo labeled with Dextran Alexa Fluor - 647 at shield stage ( 6 hpf ) . Time - lapse images were obtained with an upright Leica SP5 confocal microscope equipped with a 20 6 water immersion lens using 488 - nm Argon , DPSS 561 - nm , and 633 - nm HeNe laser lines . Frames were captured at 90 - s intervals for 3 . 5 h ( 7 – 10 hpf ) . The temperature was kept constant in all videos ( 28 u C ) . Cell Tracking Cell / nuclei tracking in three dimensions ( x , y , and z ) was performed with Imaris 6 . 2 . 0 software . The instantaneous and net speeds , as well as directional persistence ( ratio of the net displacement to the distance actually traveled by the cells ) , were extracted from the tracks . Tether Extrusion Using Atomic Force Microscopy Tethers were extruded as described in [ 24 ] using a JPK Instruments Nanowizard equipped with a CellHesion module . In short , Olympus Biolevers ( k = 6 mN ? m 2 1 ) were plasma - cleaned and incubated in 2 . 5 mg ? ml 2 1 Concanavalin A ( Sigma ) for 4 h at room temperature . Before the measurements , cantilevers were rinsed in PBS plus Ca 2 + and calibrated using the thermal noise method . For the measurement , cells were seeded on a glass slide in a home - built fluid chamber filled with DMEM - F12 cell culture medium and not used longer than 1 h for data acquisition . To depolymerize actin , cells were treated with 1 m M LatA for 10 min . Approach velocity was set to 5 m m ? s 2 1 , contact time was minimized to yield an interaction in 30 % of all contacts ( between 0 . 0 and 0 . 6 s ) , and contact force was set to 100 pN . For static tether force measurements , the cantilever was retracted for 6 m m at a speed of 10 m m ? s 2 1 , and the position was kept constant for 30 s . Resulting force – time curves were analyzed using IgorPro . For dynamic tether force measurements , each cell was probed with different speeds ranging from 1 to 50 m m ? s 2 1 in a random order . Tethers were allowed to retract completely between successive pulls . Raw data were analyzed using a home - written IgorPro procedure adapted from the Kerssemakers algorithm . Membrane - to - Cortex Attachment in Cell Migration PLoS Biology | www . plosbiology . org 8 November 2010 | Volume 8 | Issue 11 | e1000544 Tether Data Analysis and Model Assumptions Static and dynamic tether pulling experiments were used to measure the MCA energy density W 0 and the density of plasma - membrane - to - cortex cross - linking molecules n , respectively . For static tether pulling , Equation 1 , described in the Results , was used to extract W 0 from the static tether force ( F 0 ) . For dynamic tether pulling experiments , the force ( f ) – velocity ( n ) profiles were analyzed using the model described in [ 23 ] , where the pulling force depends on the surface viscosity of the plasma membrane g and on n : f 3 { fF 02 ~ av , with a ~ 2 p ð Þ 3 2 k 2 gn ln R c = R t ð Þ ð 2 Þ where F 0 is the static tether force , R c is the radius of the cell , and R t is the radius of the tether . The model was fitted to the data using a home - written least squares minimization procedure . This yielded the static tether force F 0 and the coefficient characterizing the dynamics of extrusion , a . Values for cell radius were measured with light microscopy ( Figure S2H ) , and the tether radius was calculated from static tether forces according to R t = 2 pk / F 0 [ 22 ] . The other parameters of the model ( Equations 1 and 2 ) are the plasma membrane bending rigidity k , the membrane tension s , and the membrane surface viscosity g . All three are properties of the plasma membrane that change only if the composition of the membrane itself changes , which is unlikely to happen upon perturbations affecting proteins lying within the cortex under the plasma membrane [ 51 ] . Supporting this assumption , FRAP experiments showed that the diffusion coefficient of lipids within the plasma membrane was not changed between ERM - deficient and control cells ( Figure S2A – S2F ; for methods see Text S1 ) , suggesting that membrane surface viscosity g was unchanged . Moreover , we measured the tether force ( F ) and membrane tension ( s ) in isolated control and ERM - deficient prechordal plate progenitor cells that were treated with LatA to disassemble their actin cortex . The tether force in LatA - treated cells is determined by s and k only ( see also Equation 1 ) . Both the tether force F and the membrane tension s remained unchanged in LatA - treated ERM - deficient cells relative to control LatA - treated cells ( Table S1 and data not shown ) , suggesting that k is also unchanged . The values of k , s , and g were thus kept constant for all the experimental conditions . k and g were taken from the literature with k = 2 . 9 6 10 2 19 N ? m [ 22 , 25 , 36 ] and g = 1 . 5 6 10 2 7 Pa ? m ? s [ 26 ] . Plasma membrane tension s was calculated from tether pulling experiments using cells treated with LatA ( T app = s = 2 . 5 m N ? m 2 1 ) . During tether extrusion , the model assumes that the lipids flow past the cytoskeleton - bound transmembrane molecules as they are dragged into the tether ( permeation regime ) . This is true for intermediate velocities up to several 100 m m ? s 2 1 ( Figure S2I ) , while transmembrane molecules unbind from the cortical cytoskeleton if tethers are extruded faster or membrane viscosity becomes greater [ 23 ] . Since the tether pulling velocities in our experiments were # 50 m m ? s 2 1 , we were most likely within the permeation regime , allowing us to investigate the density of binding molecules . No history effect was observed when sequential tethers were extruded from one cell ( Figure S2J ) . Cortex Tension Measurements by Colloidal Force Microscopy Cortex tension measurements were carried out as described previously [ 37 ] . In short , an AFM cantilever was modified with a glass bead ( diameter D = 5 m m ) and coated with heat - inactivated FCS to prevent unspecific binding with the cell during the contact measurement . The colloidal force probe was then brought into contact with the cell with 500 pN contact force at 1 m m ? s 2 1 . A fit to the cortical shell liquid core model [ 37 ] between 125 pN and 250 pN yielded cortex tension . To depolymerize actin , cells were treated with 1 m M LatA for 10 min . Statistical Analysis Analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) and t tests were performed after data were confirmed to have normal distribution and equal variance ; otherwise , Kruskal – Wallis tests or Mann – Whitney U tests were applied . p - values were computed in R . For cell transplantation experiments , ttest2 from Matlab was used , which compared our data points with a random distribution of numbers around one with the same standard deviation as our data .

Error bars indicate error propagated from the fit . p - value was estimated using t test . ( I ) Estimation of the range of velocities for which Equation 2 is valid . The plot represents theoretical curves , computed as in [ 52 ] , of the forces exerted on transmembrane proteins during tether extraction . The friction force ( F f , dark grey squares ) due to the flow of membrane into the tether increases linearly with pulling velocities , whereas the rupture force ( F r , light grey squares ) , at which the transmembrane protein would unbind from the cortex , increases logarithmically . The intersection between these two curves ( 600 m m ? s 2 1 ) gives the critical velocity at which transmembrane proteins unbind from the cortex . Therefore , the velocities we used for tether pulling ( lower than 100 m m ? s 2 1 ) are suitable to estimate n . The parameters used to compute the curves are the membrane viscosity ( 1 . 5 6 10 2 7 Pa ? m ? s ; Membrane - to - Cortex Attachment in Cell Migration PLoS Biology | www . plosbiology . org 9 November 2010 | Volume 8 | Issue 11 | e1000544 see Materials and Methods ) and the typical distance between cortex – membrane linkers ( 0 . 35 nm [ 53 ] ) .
