ORIGINAL ARTICLE Genomic structure and alternative splicing of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate of 53 - kDa protein Received : 2 April 2003 / Accepted : 26 May 2003 / Published online : 16 July 2003 (cid:1) The Japan Society of Human Genetics and Springer - Verlag 2003 Abstract Insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate of 53 - kDa protein ( IRSp53 ) is now known to be a key factor in cytoskeleton reorganization . The human IRSp53 was identiﬁed as a binding partner with DRPLA protein , a product of the gene responsible for a neurodegenerative disorder , dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy , as well as a binding partner with brain - speciﬁc angiogenesis inhibitor 1 . Previous studies identiﬁed at least four iso - forms ( L - , M - , S - and T - forms ) in human , where 511 amino acid residues from the N - terminus were identical , followed by unique sequences of 9 – 41 amino acid resi - dues . As each isoform had a distinct function , the unique sequences at the C - terminus had a vital role in its func - tion . Here we report that these isoforms were indeed generated by alternative splicing , which was established by experimental and computational studies on human and rodent genomes . Previous biochemical reports suggested that rodents may lack one of the isoforms ( L - form ) . This study solved this issue , as a nucleotide substitution occurred at a splice donor site followed by a large deletion in the rodent genome compared with hu - man , which made the generation of the L - form impossi - ble . This study also revealed overlapping of the IRSp53 and AATK genes coded for by complementary strands . Keywords Alternative splicing Æ Genomic organization Æ Insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate Æ IRSp53 Æ AATK Introduction An insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate of 53 / 58 - kDa protein was originally identiﬁed in hamster cells through biochemical studies after insulin and / or IGF - I treatment ( Yeh et al . 1996 ) . It is phosphorylated upon stimulation with insulin and / or IGF - I , but diﬀers from other members of the well - known insulin receptor substrate groups ( namely , human IRS1 , IRS2 and IRS4 ) in terms of conserved amino - acid sequence motifs and other features ( Hubbard and Till 2000 ) . The human homologue was identiﬁed as a binding partner with DRPLA ( Okamura - Oho et al . 1999 ) , in which CAG triplet repeat expansion in the coding region causes a neurodegenerative disorders , dentatorubral pallidoluy - sian atrophy ( Naito and Oyanagi 1982 ; Nagafuchi et al . 1994a , 1994b ; Koide et al . 1994 ) . The human homologue was also identiﬁed as a binding partner with a serpentine receptor , brain - speciﬁc angiogenesis inhibitor 1 ( BAI1 ) , and named as BAI1 - associated protein 2 ( BAIAP2 ) ( Oda et al . 1999 ) . The human homologue not only has a sequence similarity with hamster IRSp53 / 58 , but also has been demonstrated to be phosphorylated upon stimulation with insulin and / or IGF - I ( Okamura - Oho et al . 1999 ) . IRSp53 is now highlighted as a key factor in the cytoskeleton reorganization : IRSp53 functions as an adaptor that binds Rho family GTPases ( Rho , Rac and cdc42 ) and their eﬀectors ( mDia , WAVE2 and Mena ) , and mediates the activation of these molecules ( Miki et al . 2000 ; Krugmann et al . 2001 ; Miki and Takenawa 2002 ) . The cdc42 protein controls the formation of actin bundles in membrane ruﬄing and ﬁlopodia formation at the cellular periphery . IRSp53 is also known to localize at postsynaptic density of the central nerve system , which suggests a role in neurite outgrowth ( Abbott et al . 1999 ; Soltau et al . 2002 ) . To date , at least four isoforms of IRSp53 have been identiﬁed in human . We identiﬁed IRSp53 - L and IRSp53 - S , consisting of 552 and 521 amino acid resi - dues , respectively , as binding partners with DRPLA protein ( Okamura - Oho et al . 1999 ) .

Miyahara Æ A . Hoshika Department of Pediatrics , Tokyo Medical University , 6 - 7 - 1 Nishishinjuku , Shinjuku - ku , Tokyo 160 - 0023 , Japan ( 1999 ) identiﬁed two isoforms , named as BAIAP2 - a and - b , which were composed of 521 and 520 amino acids , respectively . BAIAP2 - a is identical to IRSp53 - S , while BAIAP2 - b is unique . Accordingly , we use IRSp53 - T in this report rather than BAIAP2 - b . The fourth isoform ( IRS - 58 ) , with 534 amino acid residues , was identiﬁed during a cloning process of binding partners with cdc42 ( Govind et al . 2001 ) . As the relationship between protein isoforms of 53 or 58 kDa and mRNA isoforms is still uncertain , IRS - M is used in this report for the isoform . The four mRNA isoforms have been repeatedly con - ﬁrmed in RT - PCR by both others and ourselves , as well as in many expression sequence tags ( EST ) . The four IRSp53 transcripts generate respective protein isoforms sharing the identical 511 amino acid residues from the N - terminus and diﬀering only in short peptide sequences at their C - terminus . Each isoform has distinct functions ; for example , IRSp53 - L and - S were phosphorylated with insulin but not with IGF - I in transfected cultured cells , while IGF - I phosphorylated only the T - form ( Okamura - Oho et al . 2001 ) . Thus , the unique short peptide sequences at the C - terminus have a vital role in its function probably through regulating accessibility to functional sites by intra - molecular binding . This is quite important as there are several discordance results in functional analyses with IRSp53 expression vectors . These isoforms are supposed to be generated by alter - native splicing , but it has been proved yet . Here , we report that the four isoforms are indeed generated by alternative splicing by experimental and computational studies . This study on human and rodent genomes solved the issue of whether rodents lack one of the isoforms ( L - form ) . Materials and methods DNA analyses Human genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral leukocytes with the standard phenol / chloroform extraction method . Genomic DNA of mouse and Sprague - Dawley ( SD ) rat was prepared from tail tissues with the Dneasy Tissue Kit ( QUIAGEN , Hilden , Ger - many ) . Polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) was conducted as previ - ously described ( Tadokoro et al . 1992 ) . Brieﬂy , the reaction mixture consisted of 10 ng genomic DNA , 0 . 5 l M primers , 200 l M of each dNTP and 0 . 5 U Taq DNA polymerase ( Takara , Shiga , Japan ) in standard reaction buﬀer . The PCR conditions consisted of one cycle at 94 (cid:2) C for 4 min , 30 cycles at 94 (cid:2) C for 1 min for denaturation , 56 (cid:2) C for 1 min for annealing and 72 (cid:2) C for 4 min for extension , and then another step at 72 (cid:2) C for 6 min to ensure complete extension . The following primer sets were used to amplify the exon 16 - AATK region : mouse 5 ¢ - TGCAGTCCTGT - GCCTTGCGA - 3 ¢ ( forward ) and 5 ¢ - AGAGATGCCCTCTGCA - GGGTAGT - 3 ¢ ( reverse ) ; rat 5 ¢ - CAGGAATCCCTTCGCCAAC - GTC - 3 ¢ ( forward ) and 5 ¢ - AGATGCCCTCTGCAGGGTAGT - 3 ¢ ( reverse ) . PCR products were puriﬁed with QIAXII ( QIAGEN , Hilden , Germany ) , and subjected to a direct sequence analysis with CEQ2000 Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing with the Quick Start Kit ( Beckman Coulter , Fullerton , Calif . , USA ) and a Beckman CEQ2000 automatic sequencer ( Beckman Coulter , Fullerton , Calif . , USA ) . Sequence analyses were done with computer soft - ware , Genetyx - Win ( Genetyx , Tokyo , Japan ) . Results and discussion Genomic organization of human IRSp53 When we started this study , few genomic sequences for IRSp53 were detectable in public databases , which made it impossible to determine the genomic organi - zation of the IRSp53 gene only with computational analyses . Thus , we attempted to isolate genomic clones especially covering the C - terminal region with primer pairs designed based on the cDNA sequences . As the order of exons and their boundaries were unknown at that time , multiple combinations of primers were used to try to clone intronic sequences . Several sets of primers successfully generated DNA fragments by PCR and the nucleotide sequences were determined , some of which were deposited in a public database ( see Comments ) . After more genomic sequences were deposited in public databases , along with the progress of human genome project , it became easier to identify genomic sequences covering the IRSp53 gene by BLAST searches with the cDNA sequences as well as the genomic sequences we determined . The represen - tative clones and sequences covering the IRSp53 gene turned out to be PR11 - 149I9 ( AC115099 ) and RP13 - 1277B16 ( AC129919 ) . These sequences had no annota - tion for IRSp53 to date . Comparing the cDNA ( accession numbers NM _ 017450 , NM _ 017451 and NM _ 006340 for the S - , L - and T - forms ) and genomic sequences , the human IRSp53 gene spanned about 82 kb , and consisted of 17 exons ( Fig . 1 ) . Except for the transcriptional termini ( exons 14 , 16 and 17 ) , all the exon - intron boundaries were accorded for the consensus GT - AG rule ( Fig . 2 ) . The common part of the four isoforms was encoded by exon 1 through 13 ( Fig . 3 ) . The S - form went through to exon 14 and ended with a polyadenylation ( polyA ) sig - nal . The nucleotide sequence we previously determined ( AB017120 ) had 2 , 033 bp followed by the polyA tail , while the NM _ 017450 sequence had additional 135 bp . Fig . 1 Genomic organization of human and mouse IRSp53 genes . Schematic illustrations showing that the genomic organization is generally well conserved between human and mouse , except for exon 17 . Note that although we have tried to illustrate it as faithfully as possible , the exons and several introns are too small to draw in scale 411 There was a typical polyA signal in the genomic se - quence near the end of AB017120 , but also a continuous A sequence as well in the genome ( at 96747 in AC115099 ) . Thus , the exact termini of transcripts are somewhat uncertain , and we use a longer transcript in comparison in Fig . 2 . The T - form skipped exon 14 and used exons15 and 16 . Both the L and M forms skipped exons14 and 15 and reached to exon 16 . The M - form ended with the polyA signal near the downstream boundary of exon 16 . In contrast , the L form left exon 16 halfway , just ahead of the stop codon in frame , and resumed at exon 17 , resulting in further extension of amino acid coding . The splice donor site in exon 16 for the L - form was also accorded for the consensus GT - AG rule , but slightly irregular as intronic + 3 and 4 was CT ( see below ) . It should be noted that there were only 5 bp between exons 16 and 17 , but the downstream boundary of exon 16 did not provide a splice donor site . Genomic organization in rodents Mouse and human IRSp53 were well conserved despite of long evolutional history . When compared with the S - form cDNA , they were 96 % identical over the 522 amino acids and 87 % identical at the nucleotide level over the entire coding region . Although three isoforms ( S , T and M ) were identiﬁed in rodents ( including mouse , rat and hamster ) , it has been argued whether the L - form existed in rodents ( Alvarez et al . 2002 ) . We determined mouse and rat genomic sequences covering the region downstream of exon 16 ( AB105194 and AB105195 , respectively ) . Rat has been frequently used in studies on IRSp53 as its brain , one of the main expres - sion sites , is larger than mouse . Recently , a mouse genomic sequence covering the entire coding region of IRSp53 was deposited in the public database ( NT _ 039521 ) . Comparing the cDNA ( AF390178 ) and genomic sequences , the mouse IRSp53 gene spanned about 64 kb , and consisted of 16 exons ( Fig . 1 ) . The Fig . 3 Pattern of alternative splicing of the human IRSp53 gene to generate four isoforms . The black shaded regions are used by respective isoforms ; aaa polyA tails Fig . 2 Exon - intron boundaries of the human and mouse IRSp53 genes . The boundaries were deﬁned by alignment of the cDNA and genomic sequences . It should be noted that the downstream boundaries for exons 14 , 16 and 17 are the end of the cDNA sequences indicated , and does not necessarily mean the position of the polyA tail . Upper and lower cases indicate exon and intron sequences , respectively , and the position of the boundary nucleo - tide in the given sequences are indicated . The accession numbers of referenced sequences are AC115099 for human genome , NM _ 017450 for human S - form cDNA , NM _ 017451 for human L - form cDNA , NM _ 006340 for human T - form cDNA , NT _ 039521 for mouse genome and AF390178 for mouse cDNA 412 genomic organization was also well conserved between human and mouse , although the size of several intron sequences varied . The exon - intron boundaries were similar ( Fig . 2 ) , and the generation mechanism of the M , S and T - forms was identical to human . However , there was a notable diﬀerence between human and rodent genomes , which aﬀected the generation of the L - form . Mouse and rat sequences were shorter by about 400 bp in the region corresponding to human exon 17 . In addition , there were many discordant nucleotides in the distal half of exon 16 and most parts of exon 17 when these were aligned ( Fig . 4 ) . The G nucleotide situated at the position corresponding to the splice donor site within exon 16 in human , was replaced with A in rodents ( Fig . 4 arrow ) . Although several computer programs to predict splice sites ( Splice view , http : / / l25 . itba . mi . cnr . it / (cid:1) webgene / wwwspliceview . html and Splice Site Prediction by Neural Network in Berkley Drosophila Genome Project http : / / www . fruitﬂy . org / seq _ tools / splice . html ) poorly recognized the splice do - nor site in human , the nucleotide substitution in rodents further decreased the possibility as the substitution abolished the GT consensus sequence at the boundary . Together with the ﬁnding of lack of the coding sequence speciﬁc to the L - form , we conclude that rodents do not generate the L - form . We previously detected each protein isoform with speciﬁc antibodies recognizing the unique amino acid sequences at the C - terminus , where the L - form - speciﬁc antibody recognized some protein species in rat brain tissues ( Okamura - Oho et al . 2001 ) . Based on the study described here , the detected protein species were not derived from the IRSp53 L - form , although other results are still valid . The L - form - speciﬁc amino acid sequence may be coded for by another gene in rodents , as sug - gested ( Alvarez 2002 ) . The ﬁfth isoform was recently Fig . 4 Alignment of human , mouse and rat nucleotide sequences covering exons 16 and 17 of IRSp53 . Upper and lower cases indicate exon and intron sequences , respectively . The identical nucleotides and gaps are indicate with an asterisk and a dash , respectively . The nucleotide change aﬀecting the generation of the L - form is indicated by an arrow , and is also shown in Fig . 5 . The accession numbers of the sequences are AC115099 for human , NT _ 039521 for mouse and AC105195 for rat . The regions for exon 16 and 17 for IRSp53 are boxed . As the 3 ¢ terminus of the AATK gene is unknown , it is not boxed but just indicated 413 reported in rodents , which lacks 40 amino acids encoded by exon 9 ( Alvarez et al . 2002 ) . This is generated by the use of an additional splice acceptor site within exon 9 instead of the start position of exon 9 described in this report . A similar mechanism may be possible in human ; however , no such transcripts detectable in human by RT - PCR were reported . The isoforms with and without the 40 amino acids may reﬂect the size diﬀerence in protein between 53 and 58 kDa . However , there is still confusion regarding the identity of protein species , some of which may due to diﬀerent conditions for SDS - PAGE and as yet unknown posttranscriptional modiﬁcations . Therefore further studies will be required to identify protein species . As regards evolution , it is interesting whether humans ( or ancestor species ) have gained the additional L - form or rodents have lost one of the isoforms . The former is plausible as each isoform of IRSp53 is involved in ﬁne - tuning of its function , which may contribute to advancement of the central nerve system . This should be clariﬁed by examination of other mammalian genomes , as well as by functional analyses of each isoform . Finally , the downstream sequence ( about 130 bp ) of IRSp53 was overlapped with the AATK gene , which encoded apoptosis - associated tyrosine kinase ( Gaozza et al . 1997 ) ( Fig . 4 ) . The orientation of the transcripts was opposite ( thus , encoded by the complementary strands ) and the overlap occurred in their 3 ¢ - non - coding regions . This is highlighted by homology between human and rodent sequences in the vicinity of the end of exon 17 , although the region was not used for IRSp53 in rodents . The overlap is one of the examples for enriched gene distribution in a particular region of genome . Acknowledgements We thank A . Asaka and Y . Ohtsuka for tech - nical assistance , and K .
