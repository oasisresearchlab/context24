The sensors for this process have been proposed to include cationic mechanosensitive ion channels that are opened by membrane tension . We tested this hypothesis using a microﬂuidic device to measure cell volume and the peptide GsMTx4 , a speciﬁc inhibitor of cationic mechanosensitive channels . GsMTx4 had no effect on RVD in primary rat astrocytes or Madin - Darby canine kidney ( MDCK ) cells but was able to completely inhibit RVD and the associated Ca 2 (cid:1) uptake in normal rat kidney ( NRK - 49F ) cells in a dose - dependent manner . Gadolinium ( Gd 3 (cid:1) ) , a nonspeciﬁc blocker of many mechanosensitive channels , inhibited RVD and Ca 2 (cid:1) uptake in all three cell types , demonstrating the existence of at least two types of volume sensors . Single - channel stretch - activated currents are present in outside - out patches from NRK - 49F , MDCK , and astrocytes , and they are reversibly inhibited by GsMTx4 . While mechanosensitive channels are involved in volume regula - tion , their role for volume sensing is specialized . The NRK cells form a stable platform from which to screen drugs that affect volume regulation via mechanosensory channels and as a sensitive system to clone the channel . cytoskeleton ; GsMTx4 ; intracellular Ca 2 (cid:1) ; regulatory volume de - crease ; stretch - activated channels CELL VOLUME REGULATION is essential for viability since metab - olism and the resulting changes in osmotic pressure are uni - versal , and environmental challenges are commonplace ( 1 , 21 ) . How does a cell know if its volume has changed ? One common model uses mechanosensitive ion channels ( MSCs ) , either cation selective ( 8 , 9 , 25 ) or anion selective ( 30 , 33 ) and activated by membrane tension in a swollen cell . Proposed effector proteins that restore volume after a perturbation include transporters of neutral osmolytes such as the KCl cotransporter ( 13 , 40 ) , amino acid transporters ( 20 ) , paired anion / cation channels , or the cytoskeleton operating in a three - dimensional mode ( 34 ) . In the traditional interpretation of cell volume regulation as a membrane - bound process ( 33 , 35 ) , cell swelling causes an increase in membrane tension that activates mechanosensitive channels , allowing an inﬂux of Ca 2 (cid:1) and Na (cid:1) . Most cells do show an inﬂux and elevation of intracellular Ca 2 (cid:1) before regulatory volume decrease ( RVD ) , suggesting that it serves as a second messenger for effector proteins ( 15 ) . Ca 2 (cid:1) elevation can be triggered directly by Ca 2 (cid:1) passing through MSCs ( 8 ) or arriving through the Na (cid:1) / Ca 2 (cid:1) exchanger ( 31 ) . Channels se - lective for particular ions cannot regulate volume by them - selves since volume regulation requires transport of net neutral solutes . In bacteria , the nonselective MSCs protect against extreme osmotic stress ( 22 ) because they open before lysis . Despite the presumptive role of MSCs as sensors of animal cell volume , channel activation has only been occasionally ob - served in patch - clamp experiments ( 8 , 25 ) and there is no direct evidence linking MSCs to volume regulation . The hy - pothesis that MSCs play a role in volume regulation began as an explanation of why MSCs are present in all cells ( 8 ) . Supporting the idea of MSCs having a sensory function for RVD , the lanthanides such as Gd 3 (cid:1) and La 3 (cid:1) prove capable of inhibiting both the channels ( 17 , 43 ) , swelling - induced Ca 2 (cid:1) elevation , and volume regulation ( 4 , 9 ) . However , the lan - thanides are nonspeciﬁc reagents and may have multiple tar - gets . In contrast , the cationic MSCs are speciﬁcally inhibited by GsMTx4 , a 4 - kDa inhibitory cysteine knot ( ICK ) peptide ( 28 ) found in tarantula venom ( 6 ) . The peptide has unusual phar - macological properties as it functions in both the D and L enantiomeric forms ( 39 ) . If these mechanosensitive channels serve as sensors for volume regulation , then RVD should be blocked by GsMTx4 , and we have tested this prediction in three different cell types . Only one cell type , normal rat kidney ( NRK - 49F ) , responded to GsMTx4 with a loss of RVD and Ca 2 (cid:1) inﬂux , while astrocytes and Madin - Darby canine kidney ( MDCK ) cells were unaffected . In contrast , Gd 3 (cid:1) inhibited both responses in all three cell types , consistent with its observed nonspeciﬁc interaction with MSCs and other mem - brane - bound proteins and lipids . The ability of GsMTx4 to inhibit RVD in NRK cells by inhibiting the channels , Ca 2 (cid:1) uptake , and volume regulation suggests that in this cell type the channels do in fact serve as physiological sensors of cytoplas - mic osmotic stress . The MSCs in other cell types apparently serve different functions . MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell volume measurement . Cell volume was measured at room temperature using an impedance - based microﬂuidic sensor ( 3 ) that measures the resistance of a small chamber containing the cells . As cells swell , they displace saline and thus increase the chamber resis - tance . The cells were grown as monolayers on coverslips , and these were inverted over the 24 - (cid:2) m deep sensing chamber and clamped in place . The chamber resistance was measured using a four - point resistance bridge ( evaporated Pt ) driven at 1 (cid:2) A and 50 Hz , and the voltage drop was measured using a lock - in ampliﬁer . A commercial version of this instrument is now available ( CVC - 7000 , Reichert Instruments , Depew , NY ) . The chamber was perfused with test solutions , and the cell volume was monitored in real time . The ratio of the volume change to the resting volume was calculated as previously described ( 18 ) . A fresh cell culture was used for each trace , and the data represent the ﬁrst challenge since we have found that RVD rapidly disappears with repeated stimulation ( 3 ) . Results are plotted as means (cid:3) SE of n traces . Address for reprint requests and other correspondence : S . Z .

Cells were washed and incubated in isotonic solution containing 6 (cid:2) M Fluo - 4 AM ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) at 37°C for 15 min for astrocytes , and 40 min for MDCK and NRK cells . The cells were then washed and kept in the dark at room temperature for 15 min before the experiment . The microﬂuidic chamber was also used for ﬂuorescence measurements using a Zeiss upright microscope ( Axio Imager M1 , Zeiss ) , and the data were recorded using a charge - coupled device camera ( Axiocam MRm , Zeiss ) . We used the ﬁlter set 38 HE EGFP ( excitation : 470 (cid:3) 40 nm ; dichroic ﬁlter : 495 nm ; emission : 525 (cid:3) 50 nm , Zeiss ) . Time - lapse experiments were recorded with AxioVision software ( Zeiss ) . The latencies for the Ca 2 (cid:1) increase were quantiﬁed as the time from solution change until reaching 10 % of ( peak - baseline ) Ca 2 (cid:1) . Patch clamp . An Axopatch 200B ( Axon Instruments ) was used to control patch voltage . Data were collected ( National Instruments ) using QUBIO software . Currents were sampled at 10 kHz and low - pass ﬁltered at 2 kHz through a four - pole Bessel ﬁlter . All potentials are deﬁned with respect to the extracellular surface . Electrodes were pulled on a HEKA pipette puller ( PIP5 ) , painted with Sylgard 184 ( Dow Corning ) , and ﬁre polished . Electrodes were ﬁlled with potassium solution of ( in mM ) 140 KCl , 5 EGTA , 3 MgCl 2 , and 10 HEPES , pH 7 . 4 . Electrode resistances ranged from 3 to 8 M (cid:4) . Bath saline contained ( in mM ) 140 NaCl , 5 KCl , 3 MgCl 2 , 1 CaCl 2 , and 10 HEPES , pH 7 . 4 . Pressure pulses were generated with a high - speed pressure clamp ( ALA Scientiﬁc , Farmingdale , NY ) . GsMTx4 was perfused over the patch at the indicated concentration using an ALA Scientiﬁc perfusion system . Ofﬂine data analysis was done with free QUB software ( www . qub . buffalo . edu ) . Data were averaged for a minimum of ﬁve pressure pulses . Cell culture . Cells were grown to 80 – 95 % conﬂuence on glass coverslips in 35 - mm petri dishes . Primary astrocytes were isolated from rat brain and stored frozen as previously described ( 37 ) and cultured in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium ( DMEM ) containing 10 % fetal bovine serum and 1 % penicillin and streptomycin . NRK - 49F cells obtained from American Type Culture Collection were cultured in DMEM containing 5 % calf serum and 1 % penicillin and streptomycin . MDCK epithelial cells were grown in DMEM contain - ing 10 % fetal bovine serum and 1 % penicillin and streptomycin . Solution and reagents . Isotonic and hypotonic solutions both con - tained ( in mM ) 75 NaCl , 5 KCl , 1 CaCl 2 , 2 MgCl 2 , and 10 HEPES titrated to pH 7 . 4 . The isotonic solution ( 320 mosM ) was prepared by adding mannitol to the hypotonic solution ( 187 mosM ) , keeping the ionic strength ﬁxed . To remove extracellular Ca 2 (cid:1) , CaCl 2 was re - placed with MgCl 2 . The conductivity of all solutions was gently titrated to equality using NaCl , and the ﬁnal osmolarity was measured with an osmometer ( model 303 , Advanced Instrument ) . Gadolinium chloride ( Signa - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) was prepared as a 10 mM stock solution in water . The enantiomeric forms of Fig . 1 .

The ratio of the volume change to the resting cell volume , (cid:5) V / V o , is plotted in A – D .

The cells responded in a dose - dependent fashion ( B ) with an apparent K d of 100 – 200 nM . In primary rat astrocytes ( n (cid:6) 5 ) and MDCK ( n (cid:6) 6 ) cells , 5 (cid:2) M GsMTx4 in both isotonic and hypotonic solutions had no signiﬁcant effect on RVD ( C and D ) .

RESULTS Effects of GsMTx4 on RVD . Cells were initially tested for RVD in the sensing chamber by perfusing an isotonic solution ( 320 mosM ) followed by a hypotonic solution ( 187 mosM ) . To test the effect of GsMTx4 , we perfused fresh cultures ( to avoid the adaptation seen in repeated stimulation ) with isotonic saline containing 5 (cid:2) M GsMTx4 for 10 – 15 min followed by a hypotonic challenge in saline also containing 5 (cid:2) M GsMTx4 . In NRK cells , GsMTx4 eliminated RVD and the cells contin - ued to swell as long as the stimulus was applied ( Fig . 1 A ) . The D enantiomer of GsMTx4 ( 2 . 5 (cid:2) M ) also blocked the RVD in NRK cells as shown in Fig . 1 A . However , GsMTx4 had no effect on RVD in either astrocytes or MDCK cells ( Fig . 1 , C and D ) . In NRK cells , the dose - response behavior of RVD to GsMTx4 ( Fig . 1 B ) indicated a K d of 100 – 200 nM in agreement with published results on the sensitivity of MSCs to GsMTx4 in patch - clamp experiments ( 37 ) . GsMTx4 had no signiﬁcant effect on the steady - state volume of challenged MDCK or astrocytes , although it slightly slowed the kinetics of RVD in both cell types . While all three cell types have cationic MSCs that are inhibited by GsMTx4 as shown later in this section , the results above suggest that cationic MSCs do not universally function as volume sensors . MSC currents that are visible in inside - out or cell - attached patch - clamp recordings appear generally un - responsive to osmotic stress in the bath , suggesting that they Fig . 2 .

The effect of GsMTx4 on mild slowing of the RVD kinetics in astrocytes and MDCK cells may be an effect of GsMTx4 on Ca 2 (cid:1) - activated K (cid:1) channels ( 19 , 32 ) . Since the lanthanides are known to inhibit RVD ( 9 ) , swell - ing - induced Ca 2 (cid:1) uptake ( 2 ) , and MSC activity ( 43 ) , we tested the cells’ sensitivity to 100 (cid:2) M Gd 3 (cid:1) . In agreement with previously published work ( 25 ) , Fig . 2 , A – C , shows that Gd 3 (cid:1) inhibited RVD and Ca 2 (cid:1) uptake ( data not shown ) in the three cell types by mechanisms that may include sensors and / or effectors . Extracellular Ca 2 (cid:1) entry is required for RVD . Most cells require an inﬂux of extracellular calcium ( 23 ) for RVD , and cationic MSCs that are permeable to Ca 2 (cid:1) are a likely source . We tested the effect of extracellular Ca 2 (cid:1) concentration on the swelling - induced Ca 2 (cid:1) uptake . As expected ( 37 ) , replacing extracellular Ca 2 (cid:1) with Mg 2 (cid:1) suppressed the swelling - induced Ca 2 (cid:1) increase in all three cell types ( Fig . 3 , A – C ) . These results are consistent with previous ﬁndings for astrocytes ( 8 ) and MDCK ( 32 ) . Inward Ca 2 (cid:1) current via L - type channels has been reported in NRK - 49F cells ( 10 ) , although there are no data available in the literature on RVD in NRK cells . Remov - ing extracellular Ca 2 (cid:1) without chelation did not completely abolish RVD , probably resulting from contamination with 50 – 100 (cid:2) M Ca 2 (cid:1) present in other salts . MSCs are coupled to RVD via Ca 2 (cid:1) entry in NRK cells . If Ca 2 (cid:1) entry in a hypotonic challenge occurs via MSCs , it should be blocked by GsMTx4 . In NRK cells a hypotonic challenge led to an elevation of Ca 2 (cid:1) with a striking 30 (cid:3) 8 . 6 - s latency ( Fig . 4 , A – C ) . The Ca 2 (cid:1) elevation was inhibited by 5 (cid:2) M GsMTx4 ( Fig . 4 , D – F ) . Thus , for NRK cells the simple picture of cell swelling increasing membrane tension and opening cationic MSCs causing Ca 2 (cid:1) inﬂux seems correct . The long latency may reﬂect the time required for cell swelling to cause fracturing of the cytoskeleton that normally protects the channels from osmotic stress ( 38 ) . In both astrocytes and MDCK cells , a hypotonic challenge increased intracellular Ca 2 (cid:1) ( Fig . 5 , A and C ) , but in these cells , GsMTx4 ( 5 (cid:2) M ) had no effect on swelling - induced Ca 2 (cid:1) elevation ( Fig . 5 , B and D ) . This observation suggests that the swelling - induced Ca 2 (cid:1) ﬂux did not enter through cationic MSCs . In apparent contradiction , the latency for Ca 2 (cid:1) eleva - tion in these cells was signiﬁcantly shorter than for the NRK cells ( P (cid:7) 0 . 0001 ) , as though the volume sensors in those cells were not cationic MSCs and were unprotected . Effect of GsMTx4 on stretch - activated currents . Both MDCK and NRK cells showed mechanosensitive channel activity in outside - out patch recordings , and these currents were inhibited by GsMTx4 ( Fig . 6 ) . The same effect of GsMTx4 was ob - served in primary astrocytes and reported previously ( 28 ) . The patches were perfused with bath solution to determine the baseline activity ( Fig . 6 , A and B , black line ) . GsMTx4 ( 3 (cid:2) M ) dissolved in bath solution was perfused over the patch ( Fig . 6 , A and B , red line ) to demonstrate inhibition . This reaction was reversible when the peptide was washed out with bath saline ( Fig . 6 , A and B , blue line ) . The channels in both cell types were nonselective cation channels reversing near 0 mV ( data not shown ) . The response for three patches is shown in Fig . 6 C , determined by averaging channel currents during the pressure pulse in the presence and absence of GsMTx4 . Fig . 4 .

However , only in NRK cells did the L and D enantiomers of GsMTx4 block both Ca 2 (cid:1) uptake and RVD . GsMTx4 is known to inhibit cationic MSCs in a variety of cell types including rat astrocytes , chick heart , skeletal muscle , and human smooth muscle ( 6 , 11 , 37 ) . Although the physiological function of these channels remains uncertain , the general function is not volume regulation . The inﬂux of Ca 2 (cid:1) through MSCs seems to couple channel activation to the effectors that are responsible for RVD . The effectors in NRK cells are not known , although their sensitivity to GsMTx4 , RVD , and extracellular Ca 2 (cid:1) provides a useful tool to screen candidates . Since RVD requires an inﬂux of Ca 2 (cid:1) to trigger a release from intracellular stores , the MSCs that mediate Ca 2 (cid:1) entry must be close to the Ca 2 (cid:1) release sites so the Ca 2 (cid:1) concentration will rise signiﬁcantly above the mean . Most work on cell volume regulation has focused on mem - brane - based models that utilize transport mechanisms across membranes to sense and determine cells volume , consistent with a process for the early transient stage of volume regulation before the involvement of three - dimensional cytoskeleton . However , attached cells under osmotic stress are not spheres so that the stress in the cytoskeleton dominates the response . The role of the cytoskeleton in determining the steady - state cell volume appears to have been underestimated ( 12 ) and this can account for the continued swelling when volume regulation is inhibited . When highly swelled cells were returned to normal media there was undershoot in the volume , suggesting that the cells did lose diffusible osmolytes during the RVD ( control data in Figs . 1 – 3 ) . However , the NRK cells treated with GsMTx4 ( Fig . 1 A ) and cells treated with Gd 3 (cid:1) ( Fig . 2 , A – C ) returned to the resting volume , suggesting no net gain or loss of osmolytes during the challenge . There is a 1 : 1 correlation between cytoskeletal volume and cell volume . The response to a hypotonic challenge begins with an inﬂux of water , with the cell volume lagging as it increases only with the integral of the ﬂux . Recent atomic force micros - copy experiments show that most of the osmotic stress of attached cells is borne by the cytoskeleton ( 34 ) . Swelling of the cytoskeleton may lead to breakage of cross - links and subse - quent reformation in a new pattern of interaction ( 7 ) with a lower osmotic pressure . The osmotic pressure of a gel is inversely related to the cross - link density ( 41 ) . The swelling - induced Ca 2 (cid:1) elevation could have a signiﬁcant effect on cytoskeleton cross - linking ( 14 ) , so that the cytoskeleton itself may serve as one of the effectors . During the initial phase of Fig . 5 . GsMTx4 has little effect on swelling - induced Ca 2 (cid:1) elevation in astrocytes and MDCK cells . A : time dependence of swelling - induced intracellular Ca 2 (cid:1) in astrocytes as taken from representative cells . B : time dependence of swelling - induced Ca 2 (cid:1) elevation in the presence of 5 (cid:2) M GsMTx4 . C and D : swelling - induced Ca 2 (cid:1) elevation in MDCK cells ( as per A and B ) .

The physiological function of MSCs may be to detect weakness in the local cytoskeleton . The pronounced latency of the Ca 2 (cid:1) increase with NRK cells ( Fig . 4 C ) , also observed with cells in cultures of astro - cytes and MDCK cells ( cf . Fig . 5 ) , is a signature of multiple reactions preceding Ca 2 (cid:1) entry . Some of the delay will arise from the fact that the cell volume is the integral of the ﬂux , but that will not explain the differences in latency between cell types . We hypothesize that the latency reﬂects the time re - quired for delamination of the membrane from the cytoskeleton as described for blebs ( 7 ) , and this will vary with cell type , shape and metabolic status . The short latency of astrocytes and MDCK cells to a hypotonic challenge implies that if they use membrane - bound sensors , they are partly delaminated at rest . The cell volume sensors employed in astrocytes and MDCK cells are clearly different from the MSCs observed in patch - clamp recordings since the channels in the patch experiments are blocked by GsMTx4 ( Fig . 6 A ) . This subtle variability in the sensor of cell volume may explain why cloning of the endog - enous sensors has proven so difﬁcult ( 16 ) . While cationic MSCs are likely to be members of the transient receptor potential superfamily , there are clearly many variations ( 29 ) . The ready characterization of MSCs in NRK cells using only cell volume and / or intracellular Ca 2 (cid:1) probes creates a screen for pharmacological agents that are active on that class of MSCs . The MSCs have been implicated as drug targets for the treatment of muscular dystrophy ( 36 ) , atrial ﬁbrillation ( 5 ) , glial tumors ( 27 ) , and other diseases that may involve defects in the distribution of mechanical stress . The NRK screen could be exploited to clone the GsMTx4 - sensitive channels by using randomized RNAi libraries ( 42 ) . ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank Dr .
