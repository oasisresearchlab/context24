We aimed to assess in this group the attack rate of 25 asymptomatic carriers and the symptoms most frequently associated with the infection . 26 Methods Occupational and clinical characteristics of HCWs who performed a 27 nasopharyngeal swab for the detection of SARS - CoV - 2 in a University Hospital from 28 February 24 , to March 31 , 2020 , were collected . For those who tested positive and for the 29 asymptomatic positives we checked laboratory and clinical data as of May 22 to calculate the 30 time necessary to become test - negative and to verify whether symptoms developed thereafter . 31 Frequencies of positive tests were compared according to selected variables using 32 multivariable logistic regression models . 33 Results Positive tests were 139 among 1 , 573 HCWs ( 8 . 8 % , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] : 34 7 . 5 - 10 . 3 ) , with a marked difference between symptomatic ( 122 / 503 , 24 . 2 % ) and 35 asymptomatic ( 17 / 1 , 070 , 1 . 6 % ) workers ( p < 0 . 001 ) . Physicians were the group with the 36 highest frequency of positive tests ( 61 / 582 , 10 . 5 % ) , whereas clerical workers and technicians 37 displayed the lowest frequency ( 5 / 137 , 3 . 6 % ) . The likelihood of being positive increased with 38 the number of reported symptoms and the strongest predictors were taste and smell 39 alterations ( odds ratio [ OR ] = 76 . 9 ) and fever ( OR = 9 . 12 ) . The median time from first 40 positive test to a negative test was 27 days ( 95 % CI : 24 - 30 ) . 41 Conclusions A relevant number of HCWs can be infected by SARS - CoV - 2 without 42 displaying any symptom . Among symptomatic workers , the key symptoms to guide diagnosis 43 are taste and smell alterations and fever . In median , almost four weeks are necessary to 44 achieve negativity of nasopharyngeal swab . 45 46 3 Introduction 47 Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) is a previously unknown 48 virus which recently jumped from a not yet identified animal host to humans and it is 49 responsible of coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) . 1 The virus has now spread worldwide 50 from China , causing the first pandemic of the XXI century , disrupting health - care services in 51 the affected countries and exacting a terrific toll of human lives . 2 - 3 52 Healthcare workers ( HCWs ) are a crucial actor in the pandemic . Indeed , they are acting in an 53 emergency situation and are continuously at risk of being infected . At the same time , they are 54 in contact with the most fragile elements of our society , those who need health assistance . It 55 is therefore mandatory to avoid that infected HCWs act as spreaders of the disease . 56 Unfortunately , it is still unclear which microbiologic investigations and procedures should be 57 adopted toward HCWs in COVID - 19 settings , especially to those exposed to confirmed cases 58 of COVID - 19 and at risk for infection . To answer this question , we reviewed all the 59 nasopharyngeal swab performed in HCWs exposed to confirmed cases of COVID - 19 at the 60 Foundation IRCCS Ca ' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico located in Milan , the capital 61 of Lombardy , by large the Italian region mostly affected by COVID - 19 . 4 We assessed 62 frequency of positive tests among symptomatic and asymptomatic HCWs and evaluated the 63 association between occupation , symptoms ( type and number ) , and presence of the infection . 64 Furthermore , we also calculated the median time between the day of diagnosis ( first positive 65 test ) and the day in which the HCW became test - negative . 66 Methods 67 We collected occupational and clinical characteristics of all the consecutive HCWs who 68 performed a nasopharyngeal swab for the detection of SARS - CoV - 2 at the Foundation 69 IRCCS Ca ' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico in Milan , Italy in the period from 70 4 February 24 , 2020 , ( the day after the first COVID - 19 case occurred in a physician of our 71 hospital ) to March 31 , 2020 . For workers with a positive test , we collected laboratory results 72 as of May 22 , 2020 to calculate time to test - negative . 73 We tested HCWs at risk for infection , which is defined as a contact with a patient or another 74 HCW with ( or later diagnosed with ) SARS - CoV - 2 infection . All those at risk were , according 75 to the internal protocol , identified and contacted by the hospital infection prevention unit , 76 isolated at home and tested . HCWs were subdivided into physicians ( including residents ) , 77 nurses and midwives , healthcare assistants , health technicians , and clerical workers and 78 technicians . All the information was collected by the infectious disease notification form 79 associated to each test . Workers were defined as symptomatic if presented any of the 80 following in the 14 days preceding the test : fever , cough , dyspnoea , asthenia , myalgia , 81 coryza , sore throat , headache , ageusia or dysgeusia , anosmia or parosmia , ocular symptoms , 82 diarrhoea , nausea , and vomit . For those without symptoms who tested positive as of March 83 31 , we verified through clinical records whether they developed symptoms thereafter . The 84 study was approved by the Ethical Committee ( 368 _ 2020bis ) of our institution and was 85 conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration . 86 SARS - CoV - 2 detection 87 For viral detection two different methods were used . The first one employed Seegene Inc 88 reagents ( Seoul , Korea ) . RNA extraction was performed with STARMag Universal Cartridge 89 kit on Nimbus instrument ( Hamilton , Agrate Brianza , Italy ) and amplification with Allplex® 90 2019 - nCoV assay . The second one employed a GeneFinder® COVID - 19 Plus RealAmp Kit 91 ( OSANG Healthcare , Anyangcheondong - ro , Dongan - gu , Anyang - si , Gyeonggi - do , Korea ) on 92 ELITech InGenius® instrument ( Torino , Italy ) . Both assays identify the virus by multiplex 93 rRT - PCR targeting three viral genes ( E , RdRP and N ) . 94 5 Statistical analysis 95 We compared frequencies of positive tests according to selected variables using chi - squared 96 test , adjusted odds ratios ( OR ) , and 95 % confidence intervals ( CI ) calculated with a 97 multivariable logistic regression model including as covariates gender , age class , occupation , 98 and having reported any symptom . We evaluated the discriminating ability of the number of 99 reported symptoms in a univariate logistic model and assessed the performance of each of 11 100 groups of symptoms by fitting a multivariable logistic model containing all groups of 101 symptoms . Area under the ROC curve ( AUC ) was calculated after these models . We 102 calculated the time since first positive test until HCWs became negative by using the Kaplan - 103 Meier function . Log - rank test was used to evaluate the association of gender , age class , or 104 symptoms with median time to test negativity . Statistical analysis was performed with Stata 105 16 ( StataCorp . 2019 ) 106 Results 107 In the period from February 24 , 2020 , to March 31 , 2020 , 1 , 573 HCWs , 1 , 010 women 108 ( 64 . 2 % ) and 563 men ( 35 . 8 % ) performed at least a first nasopharyngeal swab for the 109 detection of SARS - CoV - 2 ( Table 1 ) . Mean age was 44 . 5 years and the majority ( 1 , 104 / 1 , 573 , 110 70 . 2 % ) were physicians ( including residents ) or nurses / midwives . One third of women 111 ( 343 / 1010 ) and one fourth of men ( 137 / 563 ) reported having had at least one symptom at the 112 time of testing or thereafter . The majority ( 1 , 224 / 1 , 573 , 77 . 8 % ) performed only one test , 113 while 350 / 1 , 573 individuals ( 22 . 2 % ) had from two to seven tests . The overall frequency of 114 workers with at least one positive test was 8 . 8 % ( 138 / 1 , 573 , 95 % CI : 7 . 5 - 10 . 3 % ) . The 115 frequency of positive tests ranged from 8 . 0 % ( 13 / 162 , healthcare assistants ) to 10 . 5 % 116 ( 61 / 582 , physicians ) , much higher than among clerical workers ( 5 / 137 , 3 . 6 % ) . Among HCWs 117 with symptoms the frequency of positive tests was 24 . 2 % ( 122 / 503 ) . At the time of first 118 6 positive test , 28 workers among the 139 positives ( 20 . 1 % ) reported no symptoms ; of these , 119 11 developed symptoms in the subsequent weeks . Therefore , over the whole period from 120 February 24 to May 22 the frequency of test - positives among the 1070 asymptomatic HCWs 121 was 17 ( 1 . 6 % ) and the final proportion of asymptomatic among test - positives was 17 / 139 122 ( 12 . 2 % ) . The predictive role of occupation and presence of symptoms was confirmed in the 123 multivariable logistic model . The likelihood of being positive increased with the number of 124 reported symptoms . 125 All symptoms excluding sore throat were positively associated with test positivity , especially 126 fever and taste and smell alterations ( Table 2 ) . In a multivariable model , the strongest 127 predictors of a positive test were taste and smell alterations ( OR = 76 . 9 ) and fever ( OR = 128 9 . 12 ) , followed by myalgias , asthenia , ocular symptoms , and dyspnoea ( ORs ranging from 129 2 . 15 to 5 . 78 ) . The AUC from the model including these six group of symptoms was 0 . 83 130 ( 95 % CI : 0·79 - 0 . 87 ) , similar to an AUC of 0 . 86 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 82 - 0 . 90 ) when including all 131 symptoms . Sore throat was negatively associated with positivity ( OR = 0 . 30 ) . 132 Among the 139 positive HCWs , 100 ( 71 . 9 % ) were already positive at first testing , while 39 133 ( 28 . 1 % ) were found positive in a subsequent test . As of May 22 , all workers were test - 134 negative except for three who did not yet return to work ( hence did not have a control test 135 performed ) . The rate of becoming test - negative was almost null in the first two weeks , then 136 started to rise at an approximately constant rate ( Figure 1 ) . The median time from first 137 positive test to a negative test was 27 days ( 95 % CI : 24 - 30 ) ( Figure 1 ) . Workers still test - 138 positives within 30 and 60 days were 55 / 139 ( 39 . 6 % ) and 10 / 139 ( 7 . 2 % ) , respectively . 139 Median time was one week shorter in HCWs without symptoms ( 22 days , 95 % CI : 15 - 30 ) 140 than in those with symptoms ( 29 days , 95 % CI : 24 - 31 ) , but p - value from log - rank test was 141 high ( p = 0 . 91 ) due to the low number of asymptomatic workers . Median time was also not 142 associated with gender ( p = 0 . 96 ) nor age ( p = 0 . 69 ) . As of May 22 , 2020 , eight workers , five 143 7 men ( three physicians and two nurses ) and three women ( two physicians and a clerical 144 worker ) were hospitalized . 145 A minority of the HCWs ( 81 / 1 , 537 , 5 . 3 % ) reported to have had a contact with an infected 146 person outside the hospital ( relatives , colleague , or friends ) . Of these , 12 / 81 ( 14 / 81 , 8 . 7 % ) 147 were found to be positive . 148 Discussion 149 In this Italian group of HCWs exposed to confirmed cases of COVID - 19 , the presence of 150 symptoms , and particularly taste and smell alterations and fever , was associated with 151 positivity of nasopharyngeal swab for SARS - CoV - 2 . Despite the low relative frequency of 152 positive tests among asymptomatic workers , their number was high in absolute terms ( one 153 fifth of all those infected at the time of first positive test and about one eighth thereafter ) . 154 Interestingly , the AUC of a model considering six groups of symptoms ( fever , myalgia , 155 asthenia , ocular symptoms , dyspnoea , and taste and smell alterations ) was 0 . 83 . Based on 156 these results , it seems reasonable to tailor the screening approach of HCWs at risk based on 157 the resources available . In low - resource settings we suggest focusing to test those with 158 symptoms to maximize efficacy , especially considering the continuous exposure of HCWs to 159 at risk situations , thus requiring repeated testing sessions . Nevertheless , it should be 160 underlined that in our study a non - negligible number of workers were infected but displayed 161 no symptoms , meaning that a fraction of those infected can be lost with a symptoms - based 162 screening strategy . Therefore , in middle - and high - resource settings a mass screening for all 163 HCWs exposed to confirmed COVID - 19 cases appears the best approach to limit the spread 164 of the virus . More detailed cost - effectiveness study , encompassing the epidemiological 165 context , should be performed to define the optimal method . 166 8 The frequency of positive tests among symptomatic workers in our study population ( 24 . 2 % ) 167 is similar to the one ( 18 % ) reported by Keeley and colleagues 5 in their cohort composed of 168 1 , 533 symptomatic HCWs presenting with fever plus one among cough , sore throat , runny 169 nose , myalgia , headache and persistent cough . However , it should be remarked that focussing 170 only on symptomatic workers results in missing a significant number of infected subjects . 171 Indeed , we had 50 / 139 ( 36 . 0 % ) positive HCWs presenting without or with only one 172 symptom . When we consider the overall frequency , our proportion of positive subjects 173 ( 8 . 8 % ) is comparable to the 6 % described by Kluytmans - van den Bergh et al . in a small 174 Dutch cohort of HCWs , whereas it is significantly lower than the 38 % reported by Folgueira 175 and colleagues in their Spanish cohort . 6 , 7 176 When stratified according to occupation , test - positive frequencies were clearly higher among 177 subsets with direct contact with patients ( physicians including residents , nurses and 178 midwives , healthcare assistants and health technicians ) than those without ( clerical works and 179 technicians ) . Consequently , careful screening of these groups of workers should be 180 mandatory . No differences in terms of infection attack rate were seen between different age 181 groups nor between men and women , suggesting that risk factors for acquiring COVID - 19 182 among HCWs are unrelated to age and sex . 183 Another relevant point is the significant number of HCWs who were negative at the first test 184 but resulted positive when tested a second time . This might represent a serious concern , as a 185 discrete fraction of those can further spread the virus unnoticed , thus hampering the efficacy 186 of the screening strategy . It should be noted , however , that the second test was performed on 187 a small number of operators and not on a routine basis , making these considerations subject 188 to several potential biases . In addition , in a relevant proportion of our population we could 189 not retrieve information about the most likely date of exposure to a documented COVID - 19 190 case . Thus , we cannot exclude a recent contact in which case the first test may have been 191 9 performed too early ( i . e . still in the incubation period which has been estimated to be five 192 days ) , before a sufficient amount of viral particles is detectable in the nasopharynx . 8 193 Moreover , it has to be considered that HCWs employed in COVID - 19 units / hospitals are at 194 risk of SARS - CoV - 2 exposure on a daily basis and therefore repeated exposures , even 195 unnoticed , can occur also after the first one who motivated the test . Moreover , technical 196 limitation can be responsible of falsely negative test , considering that the sensitivity of 197 nasopharyngeal swab for SARS - CoV - 2 detection has been estimated to be around 71 % . 9 198 Finally , we observed a median time from first positive test to a negative test of 27 days . This 199 is in accordance with several already published reports and have a significant impact on the 200 efficiency of health systems . 10 - 12 Indeed , it means that an infected HCW will be unavailable 201 to perform its duty for almost four weeks since diagnosis . Our results were based on a three 202 genes qualitative RT - PCR . To understand the real significance of this viral detection new 203 studies assessing the infectivity of viral particles and the possible impact of quantitative 204 techniques are needed . 205 Our study has some limitations . First , the surveillance system was quickly set - up in a few 206 days due the virus spread in our region since February 20 , when the first Italian case was 207 identified in the south - east part of Lombardy . Therefore , data quality was imperfect and 208 extensive time - consuming data editing ( through review of electronical records and , when 209 necessary , of paper forms ) was required to retrieve and complete the relevant information . 210 For the same reason , and because we wanted to provide a rapid response to concerns about 211 virus spread in the hospital , we were forced to limit the analyses to only a part of the work - 212 force , i . e . , those first tested as of March 31 . Data revision as of May 22 was performed only 213 for a subset of workers ( those with a positive test and for the asymptomatic ones ) . 214 10 In conclusion , our results show that symptomatic HCWs exposed to confirmed cases of 215 COVID - 19 are almost eight times more likely to be infected than asymptomatic HCWs . 216 Nevertheless , also a non - negligible amount of asymptomatic HCWs is infected . Therefore , 217 screening strategies may be tailored according to the available resources . Taste and smell 218 alterations and fever should be considered the most relevant alarm bells suggesting the 219 opportunity of performing a test . Finally , the median time to achieve the negativity of the 220 nasopharyngeal swab was almost four weeks . These results should be merged with the 221 mounting amount of evidences showing that in many cases those identified are non - infective 222 viral particles , to find the best moment in which perform a surveillance nasopharyngeal swab . 223 Authors contributions AL , DC and AG conceived the study .
