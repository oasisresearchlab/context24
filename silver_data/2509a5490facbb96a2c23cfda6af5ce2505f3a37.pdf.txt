RES EAR CH Open Access Metallothionein - 3 modulates the amyloid β endocytosis of astrocytes through its effects on actin polymerization Sook - Jeong Lee 1 , 3 † , Bo - Ra Seo 1 † and Jae - Young Koh 1 , 2 * Abstract Background : Astrocytes may play important roles in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer ’ s disease ( AD ) by clearing extracellular amyloid beta ( A β ) through endocytosis and degradation . We recently showed that metallothionein 3 ( Mt3 ) , a zinc - binding metallothionein that is enriched in the central nervous system , contributes to actin polymerization in astrocytes . Because actin is likely involved in the endocytosis of A β , we investigated the possible role of Mt3 in A β endocytosis by cortical astrocytes in this study . Results : To assess the route of A β uptake , we exposed cultured astrocytes to fluorescently labeled A β 1 – 40 or A β 1 – 42 together with chloropromazine ( CP ) or methyl - beta - cyclodextrin ( M β CD ) , inhibitors of clathrin - and caveolin - dependent endocytosis , respectively . CP treatment almost completely blocked A β 1 – 40 and A β 1 – 42 endocytosis , whereas exposure to M β CD had no significant effect . Actin disruption with cytochalasin D ( CytD ) or latrunculin B also completely blocked A β 1 – 40 and A β 1 – 42 endocytosis . Because the absence of Mt3 also results in actin disruption , we examined A β 1 – 40 and A β 1 – 42 uptake and expression in Mt3 − / − astrocytes . Compared with wild - type ( WT ) cells , Mt3 − / − cells exhibited markedly reduced A β 1 – 40 and A β 1 – 42 endocytosis and expression of A β 1 - 42 monomers and oligomers . A similar reduction was observed in CytD - treated WT cells . Finally , actin disruption and Mt3 knockout each increased the overall levels of clathrin and the associated protein phosphatidylinositol - binding clathrin assembly protein ( PICALM ) in astrocytes . Conclusions : Our results suggest that the absence of Mt3 reduces A β uptake in astrocytes through an abnormality in actin polymerization . In light of evidence that Mt3 is downregulated in AD , our findings indicate that this mechanism may contribute to the extracellular accumulation of A β in this disease . Keywords : Amyloid beta , Endocytosis , Metallothioneins Background Alzheimer ’ s disease ( AD ) is the most common cause of dementia throughout the world . Pathological character - istics of AD include amyloid plaques , neurofibrillary tan - gles and neuronal loss . In most developed countries , the number of AD patients is rapidly increasing in parallel with the increase in aging populations . As a slowly pro - gressive disorder that affects cognition , AD imposes enormous clinical , economic and psychological burdens on families and societies , but unfortunately , no disease - modifying treatment for AD is currently available . Although diverse pathogenic mechanisms for AD have been proposed , most research has focused on the roles of amyloid beta ( A β ) and hyperphosphorylated tau — the main components of plaques and tangles , respect - ively [ 1 ] . A β plaques are dense and mostly insoluble de - posits of A β protein fragments that build up outside and around neurons . In contrast , neurofibrillary tangles are twisted fibers of tau proteins that accumulate inside nerve cells [ 1 ] . These abnormal protein aggregates dis - turb neuronal networks in the brain , eventually resulting in synaptic malfunction and neuronal loss . Of the two , A β may be a more proximal cause of AD because * Correspondence : jkko @ amc . seoul . kr † Equal contributors 1 Neural Injury Research Center , Asan Institute for Life Sciences , University of Ulsan College of Medicine , Seoul , South Korea 2 Department of Neurology , Asan Medical Center , University of Ulsan College of Medicine , 88 , Olympic - ro 43 - Gil , Songpa - Gu , Seoul 05505 , South Korea Full list of author information is available at the end of the article © 2015 Lee et al .

Lee et al . Molecular Brain ( 2015 ) 8 : 84 DOI 10 . 1186 / s13041 - 015 - 0173 - 3 mutations in the amyloid precursor protein ( APP ) gene are sufficient to cause AD . APP is a plasma membrane protein whose physio - logical functions are not yet clear [ 2 – 4 ] . Generating A β from APP requires sequential β - and γ - proteolytic cleavages inside cells [ 5 , 6 ] . Once it has been formed inside neurons , A β is secreted to the extracellular space . The extracellular A β level is determined by the A β secretion rate and the rate of A β clearance through endocytosis and degradation [ 7 , 8 ] . Accord - ingly , alterations in the endocytosis of neuronal APP affect the A β level in the brain [ 9 , 10 ] . Astrocytes produce low amounts of A β [ 11 ] . Therefore , the intracellular pool of A β in astrocytes could be derived primarily from increased internalization of the ex - ogenous A β generated by neurons , suggesting that as - trocytes may be the main contributors to the clearance and degradation of A β peptide [ 11 , 12 ] . The cytoskeletal protein actin regulates various cellular functions . It dynamically forms a polar filamentous structure ( F - actin ) that associates with diverse proteins [ 13 , 14 ] . Actin bundles localized under the plasma mem - brane play a key role in the endocytosis of external signaling - molecule complexes [ 15 , 16 ] . In particular , actin dynamics affect clathrin - mediated endocytosis [ 17 , 18 ] . Actin bundles interact with invaginated clathrin - coated pits , pulling them into the intracellu - lar space [ 18 ] . Internalized vesicles associated with di - verse proteins are then sent to their final destinations , such as lysosomes or Golgi bodies , and are thereby degraded or recycled . Therefore , the actin cytoskeleton has a key role in both membrane signal transduction and the metabolism of membrane proteins and their ligands , including APP and A β peptides . In addition to having a role in endocytosis , actin contributes to synaptic stability [ 19 , 20 ] . An increasing body of evi - dence suggests a role for actin modulatory proteins , such as cofilin and drebrin , in AD pathology [ 21 , 22 ] . Metallothionein 3 ( Mt3 ) , a zinc - binding protein enriched in the central nervous system ( CNS ) [ 23 , 24 ] , interacts with a variety of proteins , including actin [ 25 ] . Previously , we found that Mt3 plays an important role in c - Abl activation downstream of the epidermal growth factor receptor in cultured astrocytes through its effects on actin dynamics [ 26 ] . Thus , the absence of Mt3 results in a defect in actin polymerization [ 26 ] . This finding raises the possibility that Mt3 may contribute to A β endocytosis processes mediated by actin polymerization , such as clathrin - dependent endocytosis . Significant downregulation of Mt3 has been shown in AD brains ; therefore , such a reduction in astrocytic A β uptake could contribute to the accumulation of extracellular A β [ 27 ] . Thus , in the present study , we assessed the role of Mt3 in the endocytosis of A β by astrocytes . Results Clathrin - dependent endocytosis and A β uptake in cultured cortical astrocytes Cellular endocytosis occurs through two main mecha - nisms : clathrin - dependent and caveolin - dependent . To differentiate these two pathways , we monitored endo - cytosis in astrocytes by confocal microscopy in the presence or absence of M β CD or CP , inhibitors of caveolin - and clathrin - dependent endocytosis , respect - ively . To confirm the specificity of this strategy , we first evaluated the endocytosis of Alexa Fluor 488 - CtxB ( cholera toxin subunit B ) , which is known to be clathrin - dependent . To this end , we preincubated as - trocytes for 30 min at 37 °C with or without 1 mM M β CD or 1 μ M CP before adding Alexa Fluor 488 - CtxB . Although M β CD treatment did not significantly alter the endocytosis of Alexa Fluor 488 - CtxB ( green ) , which ultimately localized to Golgi bodies ( GM130 fluorescence , red ) , CP pre - treatment almost com - pletely prevented Alexa Fluor 488 - CtxB from reaching the Golgi , with CP - treated astrocytes showing only dispersed CtxB fluorescent signals ( Fig . 1a ) . These re - sults confirm the selective inhibition of the clathrin - dependent endocytosis of CtxB by CP . Because astrocytes are considered principal players in the clearance of extracellular A β in AD , understanding the underlying mechanism could be important for the development of effective treatment strategies . Using the same pharmacological approach described above for Alexa Fluor 488 - CtxB , we investigated which endocyto - sis pathway was involved in the A β uptake by astrocytes using fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) - conjugated A β 1 – 40 and A β 1 – 42 ( FITC - A β 1 – 40 , FITC - A β 1 – 42 ) . Astrocytes were incubated for 15 min with 1 μ M each of FITC - A β 1 – 40 and FITC - A β 1 – 42 after a 1 - h pretreatment with vehicle alone , 1 mM M β CD , or 1 μ M CP . Although a number of astrocytes exhibited FITC - positive ( FITC + ) particles in their cell bodies in the cultures treated with vehicle or M β CD ( Fig . 1b , arrowheads ) , few astrocytes in the CP - treated cultures contained intracellular FITC + particles . Quantification of FITC + cells showed that compared with the vehicle or M β CD treatment , the CP treatment markedly reduced the number of FITC - A β 1 – 40 + cells ( Fig . 1c ) . These results indicate that simi - lar to the case for CtxB endocytosis , both FITC - A β 1 – 40 and FITC - A β 1 – 42 also mainly enter astrocytes in a CP - sensitive , clathrin - dependent manner . Mt3 deletion disrupts clathrin - dependent endocytosis in astrocytes We next examined the possibility that Mt3 might be involved in endocytosis . As described above , we used Alexa Fluor 488 - CtxB to assess endocytosis in wild - type ( WT ) and Mt3 − / − astrocytes . Confocal Lee et al . Molecular Brain ( 2015 ) 8 : 84 Page 2 of 12 microscopy showed that fluorescently labeled CtxB appeared in the Golgi body ( stained with GM130 ) 30 min after addition in WT astrocytes ( Fig . 2a ) . In contrast , the CtxB fluorescence in Mt3 − / − astrocytes appeared largely separate from the GM130 fluores - cence , consistent with defective endocytosis ( Fig . 2b ) . Furthermore , the distribution of early endosomes ( EAA1 fluorescence ) was more concentrated around the nuclei in Mt3 − / − astrocytes than in WT cells ( data not shown ) . These findings indicate that the endo - cytotic process is defective in M3t − / − astrocytes . In a previous study , we reported that a fragment of Mt3 , the sequence unique to Mt3 and containing a TCPCP motif at position 5 – 9 in the N - terminus , inter - acted physically with F - actin [ 26 , 28 ] . Thus , we exam - ined whether this Mt3 peptide fragment as added to the medium had any effect on CtxB uptake in astrocytes . Treatment with the N - terminal TCPCP - containing Mt3 Fig . 1 A β uptake in astrocytes occurs mainly through clathrin - dependent endocytosis . a Confocal fluorescence micrographs of WT ( Mt3 + / + ) astrocytes treated with 20 nM FITC - CtxB for 30 min at 37 °C . Cells were pretreated with vehicle , 1 μ M CP , or 1 mM M β CD for 30 min before and during exposure to CtxB . After fixation , the cells were immunostained for the Golgi marker GM130 ( red ) and for the astrocyte marker GFAP ( purple ) . Hoechst 33342 ( blue ) was used to counterstain the nuclei . CtxB uptake was disrupted by CP but not by M β CD , consistent with the involvement of the clathrin - dependent endocytotic pathway ( n = 4 experiments ) . 3D images were added to help visualize the endocytosed CtxB ( 3D ) . All imaging experiments of the study were performed four times with different cultures .

Cells treated with or without 1 mM M β CD or 1 μ M CP were incubated with 1 μ M FITC - A β 1 – 42 ( B ) or FITC - A β 1 – 40 ( C ) ( green dots , arrowheads ) for 1 h at 37 °C and then with Alexa Fluor 594 - WGA ( red ) to stain the plasma membrane .

Molecular Brain ( 2015 ) 8 : 84 Page 3 of 12 peptide of Mt3 − / − astrocytes partially but not completely restored CtxB uptake ( Fig . 2c ) . Mt3 deletion decreases A β endocytosis The finding that clathrin - dependent endocytosis was defective in Mt3 − / − astrocytes strongly suggested that A β endocytosis , which is clathrin - dependent , might also be defective . To examine this possibility , we first incubated Mt3 − / − astrocytes with 1 μ M FITC - A β 1 – 40 or FITC - A β 1 – 42 ; then , the fluorescence caused by FITC - A β uptake was monitored for 15 min using a confocal microscope . After a 15 - min incubation , WT cells already showed numerous intracellular FITC + signals ( Fig . 3a – d , arrowheads ; Mt3 + / + CTL ) . In contrast , Mt3 − / − astrocytes exhib - ited much fewer FITC + dots ( Fig . 3a – d , arrowheads ) . As the case of CtxB uptake , when compared to Mt3 − / − itself , Mt3 peptide - treated Mt3 − / − cells exhibited a slight increase in FITC + signals ( Fig . 3a – d ) . Western blot analysis using an anti - 6E10 antibody also re - vealed that uptake of both A β oligomers and mono - mers was markedly reduced in Mt3 − / − astrocytes compared with WT cells ( Fig . 3e – g ) . Actin disruption affects clathrin - dependent endocytosis Actin dynamics are important for cellular functions , such as protein endocytosis and subsequent intracellular traf - ficking and recycling of various cellular proteins [ 29 , 30 ] . As such , alterations in actin dynamics have been linked to various neurodegenerative diseases , including AD , Parkin - son ’ s disease and Huntington ’ s disease [ 21 , 22 ] . Therefore , we tested whether actin disruption per se was sufficient to affect clathrin - dependent endocytosis in cortical astro - cytes using the actin - disrupting drugs cytochalasin D ( CytD ) and latrunculin B ( LatB ) . Moreover , to clarify whether Mt3 itself also regulated actin dynamics , 200 μ g of Mt3 peptide was also added to the Mt3 − / − cells . The results obtained in cells pretreated with 100 nM CytD , 1 μ M LatB , or Mt3 peptide were compared with those obtained in cells pretreated with vehicle . Although vehicle - treated control astrocytes exhibited a typical fibrillary pattern of actin staining ( phal - loidin ) , astrocytes treated with either inhibitor exhib - ited a mostly fragmented and clumped actin distribution pattern ( Fig . 4a , arrows ) . Mt3 − / − cells also mimicked the effect of these inhibitors but were re - stored to acting in a similar manner as the vehicle - treated cells when the Mt3 peptide was added ( Fig . 4a , Mt3 − / − , Mt3 − / − + Mt3 peptide ) . In addition , to observe the actin disruption - induced CtxB uptake , pretreated astrocytes were incubated with 20 nM Alexa Fluor 488 - CtxB for 30 min at 37 °C , followed by immuno - staining for the Golgi marker GM130 ( red ) and im - aging under a confocal microscope ( Fig . 4b ) . Actin disruption by either drug blocked the movement of Alexa Fluor 488 - CtxB into the Golgi , consistent with a defect in clathrin - dependent endocytosis . In addition , as was the case in Mt3 − / − astrocytes , Fig . 2 Mt3 deletion disrupts clathrin - dependent CtxB endocytosis in astrocytes . a - c Confocal fluorescence micrographs of WT ( Mt3 + / + ) and Mt3 − / − astrocytes treated with 20 nM FITC - CtxB for 30 min at 37 °C and of Mt3 − / − astrocytes treated with 20 nM FITC - CtxB for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of 10 μ g / ml of the N - terminal Mt3 peptide ( C ) . Fixed cells were immunostained for the Golgi marker GM130 ( red ) or with GFAP ( purple ) to stain the astrocytes . In contrast to WT cells , Mt3 − / − cells showed disruption of the Golgi localization of CtxB ( green ) , which exhibited a dispersed distribution 30 min after uptake , but this effect was partially reversed by the Mt3 peptide treatment ( 10 μ g / ml ) . Scale bar , 20 μ m Lee et al . Molecular Brain ( 2015 ) 8 : 84 Page 4 of 12 inhibitors of actin polymerization caused early endo - somes to concentrate in the vicinity of the nuclei ( data not shown ) . Actin disruption per se inhibits A β endocytosis Next , we examined whether actin disruption caused a reduction in A β endocytosis . As shown in Fig . 5 , a num - ber of FITC - A β + dots were present in the cytosol of con - trol astrocytes after a 30 - min incubation ; however , there were substantially fewer such dots in CytD - treated astro - cytes ( Fig . 5a – d ) . Furthermore , Western blotting analysis using an anti - 6E10 antibody revealed that the uptake of both A β oligomers and monomers was markedly re - duced in CytD - treated astrocytes compared with control cells ( Fig . 5e – g ) . Mt3 deletion causes an abnormal distribution of clathrin and PICALM , an effect that is mimicked by CytD and by LatB The clathrin coat machinery , of which PICALM ( phos - phatidylinositol - binding clathrin assembly protein ) is a key component , promotes cargo recruitment and vesicle formation and is thus essential for clathrin - dependent endocytosis . Another component of this machinery is actin , which participates in the invagination of coated pits and the subsequent transport of cargo proteins to targeted cellular regions [ 31 , 32 ] . Having found that the Mt3 deletion altered actin dynamics and disturbed clathrin - mediated endocytosis , we tested whether changes in actin dynamics in Mt3 − / − astrocytes also modulated clathrin or PICALM Fig . 3 Mt3 deletion decreases A β endocytosis . a , b Confocal fluorescence micrographs of WT and Mt3 − / − astrocytes . Cells were incubated with 200 nM FITC - A β 1 – 42 ( A ) or FITC - A β 1 – 40 ( B ) ( green dots , arrowheads ) for 15 min at 37 °C . The plasma membrane was stained with Alexa Fluor 594 - WGA ( red ) . Both the FITC - A β 1 – 42 and FITC - A β 1 − 40 uptake were noticeably reduced in Mt3 − / − cells compared with WT control cells . Again , addition of 10 μ g / ml of the Mt3 peptide partly restored the endocytosis of FITC - A β 1 – 42 and FITC - A β 1 – 40 . Scale bar , 20 μ m . c , d Bars depict the percentage of FITC ( + ) cells in the above experiments . The values were normalized to the percentage of FITC - A β 1 – 42 + ( C ) or FITC - A β 1 – 40 + ( D ) cells in the WT controls , defined as 100 % ( * * P < 0 . 01 vs . WT CTL ; n = 4 cultures ) . e Western blots for A β monomer and oligomers . Astrocytes from WT and Mt3 − / − mice were incubated with 1 μ M A β monomers .

All ratio values were normalized to the ratio in WT controls , which was defined as 1 ( * * P < 0 . 01 vs . WT CTL ; * P < 0 . 05 vs . Mt3 − / − CTL or WT A β groups ; n = 4 experiments ) Lee et al . Molecular Brain ( 2015 ) 8 : 84 Page 5 of 12 expression and / or distribution . For this purpose , astro - cytes from WT or Mt3 − / − mice were treated with 100 nM CytD , 1 μ M LatB , 10 μ g / ml Mt3 peptide , or vehicle for 1 h at 37 °C , after which the cells were fixed and im - munostained for PICALM ( green ) or clathrin ( green ) . The location of protein signals was clarified by staining the plasma membrane . Quantitative analyses of confocal images clearly demonstrated that the small - coat forma - tion in the vicinity of the plasma membrane was strik - ingly altered in the drug - treated WT cells and untreated Mt3 − / − cells , manifesting as increased intensity and stronger cytosolic or plasma membrane localization of a wide - necked - pit morphology compared with WT con - trols ( Fig . 6a – d ) . In addition , the PICALM and clathrin fluorescent signals were stronger in Mt3 − / − cells , an ef - fect that was mimicked by inhibition of actin polymerization in WT cells treated with CytD or LatB ( Fig . 6a – d ) . Conversely , adding of Mt3 peptide in Mt3 − / − cells partly restored the Mt3 WT pattern in terms of the localization and intensity of PICALM and clathrin ( Fig . 6a – d ) . Consistent with this finding , Western blots showed that both PICALM and clathrin were expressed at higher levels in actin - disrupted cells than in the WT control ( Fig . 6e ) . On the basis of these phenomena , we conclude that the absence of Mt3 alters PICALM and clathrin activity through abnormalities in actin polymerization . Discussion The central finding of the present study is that Mt3 plays a key role in the clathrin - dependent endocytosis of A β in astrocytes . In Mt3 − / − astrocytes , clathrin - mediated endocytosis , the mechanism responsible for A β endo - cytosis , was markedly decreased , whereas caveolin - mediated endocytosis was not altered . Astrocytes are likely key players in the clearance of extracellular A β ; thus , our results suggest that changes in the Mt3 expres - sion in astrocytes may have clinical relevance in AD .

After fixation , the cells were stained . Both CytD and LatB disrupted the actin cytoskeleton structure and polymerization ( arrows ) . Mt3 − / − astrocytes ( Mt3 − / − , CTL ) exhibited fragmented actin staining similar to that in CytD - or LatB - treated WT astrocytes , but this effect was reversed in part by treatment with the Mt3 peptide ( 10 μ g / ml ) .

Molecular Brain ( 2015 ) 8 : 84 Page 6 of 12 Taken together with our previous findings that Mt3 helps to maintain lysosomal degradation in astrocytes , the reduction in Mt3 in astrocytes may aggravate A β ac - cumulation in the extracellular space . Early studies showed that AD brain extracts induce more neurite outgrowth in cell cultures than do control brain extracts [ 27 ] , suggesting upregulation of a growth - inducing factor or downregulation of a growth - inhibitory factor ( GIF ) in AD brains . The latter was shown to be the case , and a subsequent study identified the downregulated GIF as Mt3 [ 27 , 33 ] . However , a later study reported controversial findings regarding the downregulation of Mt3 in AD brains [ 27 ] . Furthermore , whether Mt3 has pathogenic significance in AD has not yet been determined . Because oxidative stress may con - tribute to disease progression in AD [ 34 , 35 ] , it was pos - tulated that reduced Mt3 expression might increase the sensitivity of neurons to oxidative injury [ 24 , 36 ] . How - ever , in our previous studies , we found that Mt3 plays a key role in autophagy / lysosomal degradation in cultured Fig . 5 Actin disruption reduces A β uptake by astrocytes . a , b Confocal fluorescence micrographs of WT astrocytes were sham washed or exposed to 100 nM CytD for 1 h , then incubated with 1 μ M FITC - A β 1 – 42 ( A ) or FITC - A β 1 – 40 ( B ) ( green dots , arrowheads ) for 15 min at 37 °C . The plasma membrane was stained with Alexa Fluor 594 - WGA ( red ) .

Molecular Brain ( 2015 ) 8 : 84 Page 7 of 12 cortical astrocytes through an actin polymerization - dependent mechanism [ 26 ] , suggesting a role for Mt3 in abnormal protein degradation in AD . Notably , Mt3 downregulation in AD has been reported to occur mainly in astrocytes [ 27 , 37 ] . The present results suggest an additional significance for Mt3 downregulation in AD pathogenesis , namely a defect in A β endocytosis . Thus , Mt3 - dependent defects in A β endocytosis and Fig . 6 Mt3 deletion likely causes an abnormal distribution of clathrin and PICALM through actin disruption . a , b Confocal fluorescence micrographs of WT and Mt3 − / − astrocytes immunostained with an anti - PICALM antibody ( A ) or an anti - clathrin antibody ( B ) .

The plasma membrane was stained with Alexa Fluor 594 - WGA , and the nuclei were identified by counterstaining with Hoechst 33342 ( blue ) . Mt3 − / − cells recapitulated the CytD - and LatB - triggered alterations in the size and localization of the PICALM - and clathrin - positive signals .

Molecular Brain ( 2015 ) 8 : 84 Page 8 of 12 degradation may contribute to extracellular A β depos - ition in AD . Actin polymerization plays diverse roles in cell biology . Actin fibers are involved in cell division , cell signaling , cell motility and the establishment and maintenance of the cell shape [ 29 , 30 ] . In addition , actin plays an essential role in endocytosis and endosome trafficking [ 14 , 38 ] . Endocytosis mainly occurs through two differ - ent mechanisms : caveolin - mediated and clathrin - mediated [ 39 , 40 ] . Caveolin - mediated endocytosis is re - sponsible for the internalization of ligands that bind to GPI - anchored proteins , lipid raft - associated receptors , cholesterol , interleukin - 2 and albumin [ 41 , 42 ] . In con - trast , clathrin - mediated endocytosis is responsible for the internalization of low - density lipoprotein ( LDL ) via the LDL receptor , iron via transferrin and certain G - protein coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) [ 43 – 45 ] . A growing body of evidence indicates that the latter mechanism is dependent on actin polymerization [ 14 , 46 , 47 ] . CtxB endocytosis , which is clathrin - mediated , was also shown to be markedly reduced by drugs that disrupt actin polymerization in the present study . As we demon - strated previously , Mt3 interacts with actin and pro - motes its polymerization [ 26 ] . Consequently , in Mt3 − / − astrocytes , actin fibers were found to be fragmented , similar to how they were in astrocytes treated with the actin - disrupting drugs CytD and LatB . Moreover , the fact that only clathrin - mediated endocytosis is specific - ally reduced in Mt3 − / − astrocytes also strongly supports the interpretation that an actin polymerization defect underlies this phenomenon . Because A β endocytosis oc - curs largely via clathrin - mediated endocytosis , Mt3 − / − astrocytes were not efficient at clearing A β from the extracellular space . Clathrin - mediated endocytosis requires several pro - teins , including PICALM , which binds to clathrin heavy chain 1 ( CLTCL1 ) . CLTCL1 , in turn , is the basic subunit of the clathrin coat assembly and is thus involved in cla - thrin coat function during endocytosis [ 48 , 49 ] . Consist - ent with the observed changes in clathrin - mediated endocytosis , Mt3 − / − and CytD - or LatB - treated astro - cytes also exhibited significantly increased expression levels of both clathrin and PICALM . It is likely that the reduced endocytosis under these three conditions may have resulted in the accumulation of clathrin and PICALM in cultured astrocytes . Our previous study demonstrated that Mt3 peptides , especially those containing the N - terminal region with the TCPCP motif , mimic Mt3 in effects on the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton [ 26 ] . Since all changes shown in Mt3 − / − cells such as actin structure , CtxB uptake , localization and expression of PICALM and clathrin , and A β uptake were partly reversed when the TCPCP - containing Mt3 peptide was added , the Mt3 peptide might be taken up and compensate for the deficiency of endogenous Mt3 in astrocytes . It is likely that endocytosis , endosome trafficking and lysosomal degradation are closely interrelated in cells . Actin polymerization appears to be involved in all three processes . In the case of endosome trafficking , we found that actin disruption resulted in the accumulation of early endosomes in the vicinity of nuclei . Furthermore , actin disruption completely inhibited the delivery of CtxB to the Golgi , which is an endosome - mediated process . Thus , the delivery of endosomes to their desti - nations ( Golgi or lysosomes ) may be abnormal in astro - cytes in which actin polymerization is abnormal . Therefore , abnormalities in all three actin - dependent processes , as may occur in Mt3 - null cells , may result in reduced uptake of A β by astrocytes . Conclusions The results of the present study suggest that Mt3 plays a significant role in clathrin - dependent endocytosis , which is the main mechanism for A β uptake in astrocytes . Considering the potential significance of A β clearance in the pathogenesis of AD [ 50 , 51 ] , these new insights into the roles of Mt3 in A β endocytosis and endosome traf - ficking may provide helpful clues for strategies to pro - mote A β clearance in AD . Methods Chemicals and antibodies FITC - conjugated A β 1 – 40 and A β 1 – 42 , Alexa Fluor 488 - conjugated recombinant CtxB ( Alexa Fluor 488 - CtxB ) , Alexa Fluor 594 - conjugated WGA ( Alexa Fluor 594 - WGA ) , Alexa Fluor 633 - conjugated phalloidin ( Alexa Fluor 633 - phalloidin ) , Alexa Fluor 555 - conjugated don - key anti - rabbit IgG ( H + L ) , and Hoechst 33342 were purchased from Invitrogen ( Carlsbad , CA , USA ) . Mt3 peptide ( N - terminal region ; MDPETCPCPTGGSCTC SDKC ) was synthesized by Peptron ( Daejeon , Korea ) . Antibodies against GM130 and PICALM were obtained from Abcam ( Cambridge , MA , USA ) ; antibodies against GFAP ( glial fibrillary acidic protein ) and clathrin were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology ( Danvers , MA , USA ) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology ( Dallas , TX , USA ) , respectively . CP , an inhibitor of clathrin - dependent endocytosis , and M β CD , which removes or disrupts cholesterol in plasma membranes , were pur - chased from Sigma - Aldrich ( St . Louis , MO , USA ) . CytD and LatB , which disrupt actin , were also obtained from Sigma - Aldrich . Animals Mt3 − / − mice , produced as described by Erickson et al . [ 52 ] , were kindly provided by Dr . Palmiter ( University of Washington , Seattle , USA ) . Mt3 + / + wild - type ( WT ) mice Lee et al . Molecular Brain ( 2015 ) 8 : 84 Page 9 of 12 and Mt3 − / − mice were obtained by breeding male heterozygous C67BL6 / 129Sv hybrid mice ( Mt3 + / − ) with female heterozygous mice . The mice were maintained in the Animal Facility of the University of Ulsan , College of Medicine ( Seoul , Republic of Korea ) . The offspring of the matings were genotyped by polymerase chain reac - tion ( PCR ) using the WT - specific sense primer 5 ′ - CTC TCT ACA GAG GCC CGG CAG TCA C - 3 ′ and the primer 5 ′ - CAC AGT CCT TGG CAC ACT TCT CAC ATC CG - 3 ′ ( for both types ) . Cell culture Astrocytes were prepared from neonatal ( 2 - to 3 d old ) mice . Cerebral cortices were removed , triturated by pip - etting and seeded into multi - well culture plates ( BD Bio - sciences , Franklin Lakes , NJ , USA ) in Dulbecco ’ s modified Eagle ’ s medium ( DMEM ) supplemented with fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) and horse serum ( 7 % [ v / v ] of each component ) and with penicillin - streptomycin ( 100 IU / mL and 100 μ g / mL , respectively ) . Primary cor - tical cultures were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified 5 % ( v / v ) CO 2 atmosphere until the cells reached conflu - ence . The medium was changed every 3 d with rigorous shaking to remove contaminating non - adherent cells from adherent astrocytes . The resulting astrocyte - enriched cultures were approximately 95 % pure , as indi - cated by tests for glial fibrillary acidic protein ( GFAP ) immunoreactivity . All culture reagents except FBS ( Hyclone , Logan , UT , USA ) were purchased from Invitrogen . Uptake of cholera toxin subunit B After a wash with minimal essential medium ( MEM ) , astrocyte cultures were incubated with 20 nM CtxB for 1 h at 4 °C . After reaching a steady state of CtxB bind - ing , the washed cells were further incubated at 37 °C in a humidified CO 2 incubator for the indicated times . After incubation , the cells were washed with cold phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) to remove unbound CtxB and fixed by incubation with ice - cold 4 % parafor - maldehyde ( PFA ) in PBS for 30 min at 4 °C . Internalized CtxB was observed by confocal fluorescence microscopy using an LSM - 710 microscope ( Carl Zeiss , Oberkochen , Germany ) equipped with ZEN software and a laser - imaging system with different filters . Preparation of A β oligomers Throughout this work , A β 40 or A β 42 ( Genscript , Piscat - away , NJ , USA ) was used to generate the oligomeric form according to a previously published protocol [ 53 ] . In brief , lyophilized peptides were dissolved in 1 , 1 , 1 , 3 , 3 , 3 - hexafluoro - 2 - propanol ( HFIP ; Sigma - Aldrich , Oakville , Ontario , Canada ) to ensure that the starting material was in a homogeneous non - aggregated monomeric state ; then , the aliquots containing peptide were placed in polypropylene microcentrifuge tubes . HFIP was removed by evaporation , and the resulting A β 40 or A β 42 peptide films were stored at − 80 °C . For aggregation protocols , the peptide film was reconstituted in dimethylsulfoxide to give a 5 mM A β 40 or A β 42 stock solution . For oligomeric conditions , DMEM / F - 12 ( Dul - becco ’ s modified Eagle ’ s medium : nutrient mixture F - 12 ) without phenol red was added to bring the peptide to a final concentration of 100 μ M , and the solution was then incubated at 4 °C for 24 h . Uptake of FITC - A β fragments Primary astrocytes plated on cover slips were stained with 5 μ g / ml Alexa Fluor 594 - WGA for 10 min at 37 °C . Stained astrocytes were incubated with 1 μ M FITC - A β 1 – 40 or FITC - A β 1 – 42 , then chased with a FITC - A β 1 – 40 - or FITC - A β 1 – 42 - free solution ; the cellular uptake of FITC - A β fragments was analyzed at the indicated times during the chase period using a Carl Zeiss LSM710 laser - scanning confocal microscope . For counting A β - internalized astrocytes , at least five fields per slip con - taining more than 20 cells were randomly chosen . Only cells with clear intracellular A β were considered A β - positive ( A β + ) cells . To examine whether the actin cyto - skeleton influenced the route of A β internalization or extent of A β uptake , we treated cells with 100 nM CytD , 1 μ M LatB , 1 mM M β CD , 1 μ M CP , or 10 μ g / ml of Mt3 peptide during the chase periods . Immunocytochemistry CtxB - internalized or normal astrocytes were fixed with 4 % ( v / v ) PFA for 30 min and permeabilized by incuba - tion with PBS containing 0 . 2 % ( v / v ) Triton X - 100 and 1 % ( w / v ) bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) for 10 min . After a PBS wash , the astrocytes were blocked with PBS con - taining 1 % BSA . The cells were incubated overnight with primary antibodies against clathrin , PICALM , GFAP and GM130 at 4 °C . The next day , the cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 - conjugated ( clathrin , and PICALM ) or Alexa Fluor 555 - conjugated ( GM130 ) secondary antibodies . For astrocyte staining , the cells were co - stained with a GFAP antibody . For counter - staining of the plasma membrane and nuclei , the cells were incubated with 5 μ g / ml Alexa Fluor 594 - WGA ( at 37 °C ) and 1 μ M Hoechst 33342 ( Invitrogen ) ( at RT ) for 10 min . After incubation , the cells were washed three times with PBS and slide - mounted with mounting media ( Dako , Glostrup , Denmark ) . Western blot analysis Protein expression levels were measured in whole - cell extracts of cultured cortical astrocytes . Astrocytes ob - tained from both WT and Mt3 - null mice were cultured Lee et al . Molecular Brain ( 2015 ) 8 : 84 Page 10 of 12 for 14 – 21 days in vitro ( DIV ) and then sonicated in lysis buffer ( 20 mM Tris - Cl pH 7 . 4 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM EGTA , 1 % [ v / v ] Triton X - 100 , 2 . 5 mM sodium pyrophosphate , 1 μ M Na 3 VO 4 , 1 μ g / mL leupep - tin , and 1 mM PMSF ) . After centrifugation , the protein concentrations in the supernatants were determined by the bicinchoninic acid ( BCA ) method ( Thermo Scien - tific , Rockford , IL , USA ) . For Western blotting , equal amounts of protein were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS - PAGE ) and transferred to polyviny - lidene difluoride membranes . Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit ( Pierce , Rockford , IL , USA ) and protein expression was quantitatively assessed by densitometric analysis of the intensity of protein bands . All experiments were re - peated at least three times using cultures from neonatal mice born from different females . Statistics All of the data are presented as the means ± SEMs . For multiple comparisons among groups , one - way analysis of variance followed by a Fisher LSD post hoc test was employed . Paired t - tests were used to analyze differences between two groups . P - values < 0 . 05 were considered statistically significant .
