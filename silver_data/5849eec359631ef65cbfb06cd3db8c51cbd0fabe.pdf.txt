How - ever , despite similar primary sequences , structural folds , and affinities for G - actin and poly - l - proline , budding yeast profilin ScPFY fails to complement fission yeast profilin SpPRF temperature - sensitive mutant cdc3 - 124 cells . To identify profilin’s essential properties , we built a combinatorial library of ScPFY variants containing either WT or SpPRF residues at multiple positions and carried out a genetic selection to isolate variants that support life in fission yeast . We subsequently engineered ScPFY ( 9 - Mut ) , a variant containing nine substitu - tions in the actin - binding region , which complements cdc3 - 124 cells . ScPFY ( 9 - Mut ) , but not WT ScPFY , suppresses severe cytokinesis defects in cdc3 - 124 cells . Furthermore , the major activity rescued by ScPFY ( 9 - Mut ) is the ability to enhance cytokinesis formin Cdc12 - mediated actin assembly in vitro , which allows cells to assemble functional contractile rings . Therefore an essential role of profilin is to specifically facilitate formin - mediated actin assembly for cytokinesis in fission yeast . INTRODUCTION Cells are poised to rapidly assemble actin filaments because they maintain a large reserve of actin monomers bound to the small , ∼ 14 - kDa protein profilin ( Carlsson et al . , 1977 ; Pollard and Cooper , 1984 ) . Profilin prevents unwanted spontaneous actin assembly by strongly inhibiting nucleation , but profilin - actin readily adds to free barbed ends once new filaments are formed by an expanding list of nucleation and elongation factors ( Chhabra and Higgs , 2007 ; Chesarone and Goode , 2009 ; Dominguez , 2009 ) . These factors in - clude proteins like formin and Ena / VASP , which contain continuous stretches of proline residues that profilin can bind simultaneously with actin ( Schutt et al . , 1993 ; Reinhard et al . , 1995 ; Chang et al . , 1997 ; Evangelista et al . , 1997 ; Mahoney et al . , 1997 , 1999 ) . In addition , most profilins increase the nucleotide exchange rate of actin mono - mers ( Mockrin and Korn , 1980 ) , which is essential in yeast ( Wolven et al . , 2000 ; Lu and Pollard , 2001 ) . Profilin also binds to phosphati - dylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ; Goldschmidt - Clermont et al . , 1990 ) , although the physiological significance is less clear . Formins are specialized nucleation factors that drive rapid profi - lin - actin assembly for processes such as division , motility , and polar - ization ( Higgs , 2005 ; Kovar , 2006 ; Breitsprecher and Goode , 2013 ) . Formins are large proteins with two internal actin assembly formin homology ( FH ) domains FH1 and FH2 , which are flanked by regula - tory domains . The FH1 domain binds profilin - actin and transfers it to the FH2 domain – associated barbed end ( Vavylonis et al . , 2006 ) . This direct transfer mechanism has been proposed to explain how the FH1 and FH2 domains cooperate to nucleate filaments that elon - gate profilin - actin up to 12 - fold faster than control filaments ( Romero et al . , 2004 ; Kovar et al . , 2006 ; Vavylonis et al . , 2006 ; Paul and Pollard , 2008 ; Vidali et al . , 2009 ) . However , this model is oversimpli - fied , as we discovered that the FH2 domain plays a critical role in allowing formins to drive the rapid assembly of profilin - actin ( Neidt et al . , 2009 ; Scott et al . , 2011 ) . We hypothesized that profilin may interact directly with the FH2 domain , which might help facilitate dissociation of profilin from the barbed end in preparation for the Monitoring Editor Fred Chang Columbia University Received : May 28 , 2013 Revised : Nov 5 , 2014 Accepted : Nov 6 , 2014 This article was published online ahead of print in MBoC in Press ( http : / / www . molbiolcell . org / cgi / doi / 10 . 1091 / mbc .

Molecular Biology of the Cell profilin temperature - sensitive ( ts ) mutant ( Christensen et al . , 1996 ) , and bovine profilin 1 moderately rescues growth and cytokinesis defects in profilin - minus Dictyostelium cells ( Schluter et al . , 1998 ) . However , multiple pro - filin isoforms within the same cell interact dif - ferently with particular actin filament nuclea - tors to carry out different cellular roles ( Pilo Boyl et al . , 2007 ; Khadka et al . , 2009 ; Mou - neimne et al . , 2012 ) , and some profilins can - not replace each other . For example , bud - ding yeast profilin ScPFY fails to complement the fission yeast profilin SpPRF ts mutant cdc3 - 124 ( Balasubramanian et al . , 1994 ) . Therefore ScPFY may not be capable of per - forming a critical function in fission yeast , which could reveal profilin’s essential cellular functions . Fission yeast cells have at least four distinct actin structures , which each car - ries out specific cellular roles ( La Carbona et al . , 2006 ; Kovar et al . , 2011 ) . Arp2 / 3 com - plex makes highly dynamic branched fila - ments for endocytic actin patches , whereas formins make less dynamic straight filaments for the cytokinetic contractile ring ( Cdc12 ) , polarized actin cables ( For3 ) , and mating ( Fus1 ; Kovar et al . , 2011 ) . To elucidate the essential function ( s ) of profilin in fission yeast , we created a combi - natorial library of budding yeast profilin ScPFY variants and selected for mutations that complement the fission yeast profilin ts mutant cdc3 - 124 ( Nurse et al . , 1976 ) . To de - termine the fundamental properties rescued by the isolated ScPFY mutants , we used a combination of in vitro bio chemistry and live - cell time - lapse fluorescence microscopy . RESULTS Isolation of an evolved budding yeast profilin ( ScPFY ) that supports life in fission yeast Despite 72 % similar amino acid sequences , similar structural folds , and similar affinities for monomeric actin and poly - l - proline ( Table 1 ; Eads et al . , 1998 ; Lu and Pollard , 2001 ) , budding yeast profilin ( ScPFY ) fails to complement fission yeast profilin ts mutant cdc3 - 124 cells at the restrictive temperature of 36°C ( Figure 1A ; Balasubramanian et al . , 1994 ) . To identify the function that ScPFY is not capable of performing in fission yeast , we carried out directed evolution to convert ScPFY into fission yeast profilin ( SpPRF ) by single - residue editing and selected for ScPFY variants that make cdc3 - 124 cells viable at the restrictive temperature ( see Materials and Methods ) . We initially targeted 16 of the 39 divergent residues between ScPFY and SpPRF ( Supplemental Figure S1 , A and B ) . Residues were selected because they 1 ) are invariant in profilins from the fission yeast genus Schizosaccharomyces , 2 ) are spread throughout the ScPFY structure , and 3 ) have single nucleotide degeneracy between next round of actin monomer addition ( Neidt et al . , 2009 ; Scott et al . , 2011 ) . Given their similar biochemical properties and general role in maintaining a common pool of ATP - loaded G - actin ( Witke , 2004 ; Jockusch et al . , 2007 ) , it is not surprising that diverse profilins can often substitute for each other . For example , human profilin 1 comple - ments a budding yeast profilin - null mutant ( Ostrander et al . , 1999 ) , the plant profilins AtPRF1 and AtPRF3 partially rescue a fission yeast FIGURE 1 : Nine mutations in budding yeast profilin , ScPFY ( 9 - Mut ) , partially complement fission yeast profilin - ts cells .

Selection of ∼ 500 , 000 variants identified 17 unique ScPFY mutants containing 3 – 11 residue changes that are capable of allowing cdc3 - 124 cells to grow at the restrictive temperature ( Supplemental Figure S1C and Supplemental Table S1 ) . All but one of the 17 mu - tants included the M69I mutation ( Supplemental Table S2 ) . Although M69I is neither necessary nor sufficient to complement cdc3 - 124 cells , we found that the surrounding area that includes the actin - binding region is generally important for complementation ( Supple - mental Figure S2 ) . There are nine amino acid differences between SpPRF and ScPFY in this region , of which only five were initially se - lected for mutation . We therefore made ScPFY ( 9 - Mut ) , in which all nine residues were edited to their SpPRF counterpart ( red residues in Figure 1B , red boxes in Supplemental Figure S1A ) . ScPFY ( 9 - Mut ) functions better in fission yeast cells than either wild - type ( WT ) ScPFY or the originally isolated ScPFY variants but not as well as SpPRF ( Figure 1 , A and C – E ) . Cdc3 - 124 cells express - ing ScPFY ( 9 - Mut ) from a plasmid under control of the weakest P81nmt1 promoter are significantly healthier than an empty vector control , WT ScPFY , or an original ScPFY ( V16 ) mutant ( Figure 1 , C – E ) . For example , the percentage of cdc3 - 124 cells with greater than two nuclei dropped from 60 % for WT ScPFY to 28 % for ScPFY ( 9 - Mut ) ( Figure 1D ) , and the percentage of abnormal septa decreased from 96 % for WT ScPFY to 65 % for ScPFY ( 9 - Mut ) ( Figure 1E ) . Comparison of ScPFY ( 9 - Mut ) ’s general biochemical properties To determine the rescued fundamental activity that allows comple - mentation of cdc3 - 124 cells , we purified ScPFY ( 9 - Mut ) and investi - gated its general biochemical properties . We found that most of the properties of ScPFY ( 9 - Mut ) are not closer to SpPRF than to ScPFY and are therefore unlikely the reason for ScPFY ( 9 - Mut ) ’s ability to rescue growth in cdc3 - 124 cells ( Table 1 ; described in detail in the Supplemental Results ) . 1 ) The stability of ScPFY ( 9 - Mut ) , as deter - mined by urea denaturation , is lower than that of either ScPFY or SpPRF ( Supplemental Figure S3A ) . 2 ) The affinity of ScPFY ( 9 - Mut ) for muscle G - actin and ability to prevent spontaneous actin assembly are similar to those of both ScPFY and SpPRF ( Supplemental Figure S3 , B and C ) . 3 ) The affinities of both ScPFY ( 9 - Mut ) and ScPFY for fission yeast G - actin are slightly higher than that of SpPRF ( Supple - mental Figure S3 , D and E ) . 4 ) Both ScPFY ( 9 - Mut ) and ScPFY increase the rate of G - actin nucleotide exchange significantly more than does SpPRF ( Supplemental Figure S3 , F and G ) . 5 ) The affinity of ScPFY ( 9 - Mut ) and ScPFY for the proline - rich ligands poly - l - proline ( PLP ) and the formin Cdc12 FH1 domain are ∼ 3 . 5 - fold lower than that of SpPRF ( Supplemental Figure S4 , A and B ; Chang et al . , 1997 ) . Conversely , ScPFY ( 9 - Mut ) binds PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 micelles twofold better than SpPRF and fivefold better than WT ScPFY ( Table 1 and Supplemental Figure S4C ) . However , we do not believe that ScPFY ( 9 - Mut ) ’s increased affinity for PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 explains its ability to complement cdc3 - 124 cells . First , human profilin HsPRO1 also binds PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 micelles very well ( Kovar et al . , 2001 ; Skare and Karlsson , 2002 ) , yet it fails to complement cdc3 - 124 cells ( see later discussion of Figure 4A ; Ezezika et al . , 2009 ) . Second , plant profilin AtPRF1 weakly complements cdc3 - 124 cells ( see Figure 4A ; Christensen et al . , 1996 ) , yet it binds PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 poorly ( Skare and Karlsson , 2002 ) . ScPFY ( 9 - Mut ) suppresses cytokinesis defects in profilin - mutant cdc3 - 124 cells Because WT ScPFY and ScPFY ( 9 - Mut ) bind similarly to their general ligands G - actin and proline - rich peptides , the basis for P r o fi li n P r o t e i n s t a b ili t y a ( D 1 / 2 , M u r e a ) P o l y - l - p r o li ne b i n d i n g b ( K d , μ M ) C d c 12 ( F H 1 ) b i n d i n g c ( K d , μ M ) M u s c l e G - a c t i n b i n d i n g d ( K d , μ M ) F i ss i o n y e a s t G - a c t i n b i n d - i n g e ( a c t i n b a n d i n t en s i t y a t 5 μ M p r o fi li n , a . u . ) N u c l e o t i d e e x c h a n g e f ( t i m e t o o ne - h a l f e x c h a n g e a t 0 . 5 μ M p r o fi li n , s ) P t d I n s ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 b i n d i n g g ( p e r c en t a g e un b o un d p r o fi li n i n fl o w t h r o u g h , 100 μ M P t d I n s ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) S p P R F 4 . 5 59 6 . 4 0 . 8 6 . 4 59 . 3 ± 6 . 7 34 . 1 ± 1 . 6 S c P F Y 3 . 3 224 24 . 7 0 . 7 10 . 1 29 . 0 ± 3 . 9 57 . 4 ± 2 . 8 S c P F Y ( 9 - M u t ) 2 . 6 195 22 . 7 0 . 4 9 . 4 16 . 3 ± 3 . 9 18 . 0 ± 2 . 9 a S u pp l e m en t a l F i g u r e S3 A . b S u pp l e m en t a l F i g u r e S4 A . c Su pp l e m en t a l F i g u r e S4 B . d S u pp l e m en t a l F i g u r e S3 , B a n d C . e Su pp l e m en t a l F i g u r e S 3 , D a n d E . f Su p p l e m en t a l F i g u r e S 3 , F a n d G . g S u pp l e m en t a l F i g u r e S4 C .

Molecular Biology of the Cell cells expressing WT ScPFY ( Figure 3 , A and B , and Supplemental Video S2 ) . However , expression of either SpPRF or ScPFY ( 9 - Mut ) increases the percentage of functional rings to ∼ 40 % by 35 min . The decreased expression level of SpPRF from the weakest P81nmt1 promoter likely accounts for < 100 % functional contractile rings ( Supplemental Figure S5 ) . Therefore profilin’s essential role in formin Cdc12 - mediated cytokinetic contractile ring assembly is properly performed only by profilins that support life in fission yeast ( SpPRF and ScPFY ( 9 - Mut ) ) . Profilins that do not support life in fission yeast cells do not stimulate formin Cdc12 - mediated actin assembly in vitro Profilin’s capacity to facilitate contractile ring assembly appears to be critical for viability . Formin Cdc12 is essential for cytokinesis ( Chang et al . , 1997 ) , and its ability to rapidly assemble actin fila - ments for contractile ring assembly requires profilin ( Chang et al . , 1997 ; Kovar et al . , 2003 ; Yonetani et al . , 2008 ) . Human profilin HsPRO1 does not complement cdc3 - 124 cells and is utilized poorly by Cdc12 in vitro ( Ezezika et al . , 2009 ) . Therefore we determined whether there is a correlation between the ability of diverse profilins to complement cdc3 - 124 cells and to enhance actin assembly in vitro mediated by a constitutively active Cdc12 construct containing the formin homology FH1 and FH2 domains ( Figure 4 ; Kovar et al . , 2003 , 2006 ; Kovar and Pollard , 2004 ; Neidt et al . , 2008 ; Scott et al . , 2011 ) . We found that only profilins from the fission yeast genus Schizosaccharomyces ( SpPRF , SjPRF ) complement cdc3 - 124 cells well ( Figure 4A ) and increase the in vitro rate of Cdc12 - mediated actin assembly over the rate of formin alone ( Figure 4 , B and C ) . Budding yeast ( ScPFY ) , mammalian ( HsPRO1 , MmPRF1 ) , and worm ( CePFN - 1 ) profilins do not complement cdc3 - 124 cells ( Figure 4A ) and decrease the rate of Cdc12 - mediated actin assembly over a range of profilin concentrations ( Figure 4 , B and C ; Ezezika et al . , 2009 ; Neidt et al . , 2009 ) . Plant profilin AtPRF1 somewhat comple - ments cdc3 - 124 cells ( Figure 4A ; Christensen et al . , 1996 ) and , com - pared with the noncomplementing profilins , decreases the rate of Cdc12 - mediated actin assembly more modestly ( Figure 4C ) . There - fore there is a general correlation between the ability of diverse pro - filins to support life in fission yeast and to facilitate formin Cdc12 - mediated actin assembly . ScPFY ( 9 - Mut ) complementing cdc3 - 124 cells is likely more compli - cated . Vegetatively growing fission yeast cells primarily have three actin - dependent structures , each of which is dependent on a spe - cific actin assembly factor : endocytic actin patches ( Arp2 / 3 com - plex ) , cytokinetic contractile rings ( formin Cdc12 ) , and polarizing actin cables ( formin For3 ; Kovar et al . , 2011 ) . However , actin cables are not required for viability ( Feierbach and Chang , 2001 ) . Fission yeast profilin mutant cells are primarily defective in cytokinesis ( Balasubramanian et al . , 1994 , 1996 ; Chang et al . , 1996 ; Lu and Pol - lard , 2001 ) , although endocytic actin patch defects have also been reported ( Pelham and Chang , 2001 , 2002 ) . Therefore we used fluo - rescence imaging to determine whether defects in either Arp2 / 3 complex – mediated endocytosis or formin Cdc12 - mediated cytoki - nesis are the primary reasons that cdc3 - 124 cells are not viable . Vi - sualizing the internalization of the integral membrane marker green fluorescent protein GFP - Syb1 ( Basu and Chang , 2011 ) revealed that compared with WT cells treated with the Arp2 / 3 complex in - hibitor CK - 666 ( Nolen et al . , 2009 ) , cdc3 - 124 cells do not have ma - jor endocytosis defects at permissive ( 25°C ) , semipermissive ( 32°C ) , or restrictive ( 36°C ) temperature ( Figure 2 ) . It is therefore unlikely that cdc3 - 124 cells are inviable due to endocytosis defects . Con - versely , depletion of profilin in fission yeast leads to dysfunctional formin Cdc12 - mediated contractile rings that fail to constrict during cytokinesis ( Figure 3 ) . Contractile rings were labeled with the myo - sin - II regulatory light chain Rlc1 - GFP to follow their assembly and constriction ( Figure 3A ; Le Goff et al . , 2000 ) . Time - lapse fluores - cence microscopy revealed that 100 % of dividing WT cells form a functional contractile ring that begins constricting by 35 min , whereas after 2 h at the semirestrictive temperature of 32°C , no di - viding cdc3 - 124 cells form constricting rings by 35 min ( Figure 3B and Supplemental Video S1 ) . Therefore profilin mutant cdc3 - 124 cells have significant functional defects in cytokinesis but not endocytosis . We next determined whether contractile ring assembly defects in cdc3 - 124 cells are suppressed by expression of ScPFY ( 9 - Mut ) . We constructed cdc3 - 124 strains with SpPRF , WT ScPFY , or ScPFY ( 9 - Mut ) integrated at the ura4 locus ( one copy per cell ) under control of the P81nmt1 thiamine - repressible promoter . After 2 h at 32°C , no functional contractile rings are assembled after 35 min in cdc3 - 124 FIGURE 2 : Profilin mutant cdc3 - 124 cells do not have significant endocytosis defects .

Therefore we used three different pyrene actin assays to determine profilin’s general effect on Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) - mediated actin filament assembly ( Figure 5 ) . First , we followed the spontaneous assembly of 2 . 5 μM actin monomers with 50 nM Cdc12 and a range of profilin concen - trations ( Figure 5 , A and B ) . Over a large range of profilin concentra - tions , SpPRF increases Cdc12 - mediated actin assembly , whereas WT ScPFY decreases it . ScPFY ( 9 - Mut ) has an intermediate ability to stimulate Cdc12 - mediated actin assembly , increasing the rate at lower concentrations and gradually decreasing the rate at higher concentrations . Second , we examined the ability of a range of Cdc12 concentrations to stimulate the assembly of equimolar con - centrations of actin and profilin ( 1 . 5 μM ; Figure 5 , C and D ) . Cdc12 assembles actin associated with ScPFY ( 9 - Mut ) at a level intermedi - ate between SpPRF and WT ScPFY . Third , we followed the effect of a range of profilin concentrations on the elongation of preassem - bled actin filament barbed ends associated with Cdc12 ( Figure 5 , E and F ) . Both SpPRF and ScPFY ( 9 - Mut ) increase the seeded assembly rate , whereas WT ScPFY does not . We also used total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) micros - copy to visualize and quantify the specific effect of profilin on the barbed - end elongation rate of individual actin filaments ( Figures 6 , A and B , Supplemental Figure S6 , and Supplemental Videos S3 – S6 ) . In the absence of profilin , Cdc12 - associated filaments elongate at ∼ 0 . 5 subunit / s , whereas internal control filaments elongate at ∼ 9 . 0 subunits / s ( Figure 6A ; Kovar et al . , 2003 ; Neidt et al . , 2008 ; Skau et al . , 2009 ; Scott et al . , 2011 ) . All three profilins increase the elon - gation rate of Cdc12 - associated filaments but by significantly differ - ent amounts ( Figure 6 , A and B ) . SpPRF increases Cdc12 - mediated barbed - end elongation by ∼ 30 - fold , WT ScPRF by only ∼ 10 - fold , and ScPFY ( 9 - Mut ) by an intermediate ∼ 20 - fold . Therefore the fission yeast cytokinesis formin Cdc12 assembles actin associated with ScPFY ( 9 - Mut ) significantly better than actin associated with WT ScPFY , likely explaining why ScPFY ( 9 - Mut ) allows Cdc12 - mediated contractile ring assembly in cells . DISCUSSION An essential role of profilin is to facilitate formin - mediated actin assembly for cytokinesis We report here that profilin’s ability to enhance formin Cdc12 - medi - ated actin filament elongation for assembly of the cytokinesis con - tractile ring is essential in fission yeast . Inefficient actin filament elongation presumably leads to a deficient number of appropriately long actin filaments . Actin filaments assembled by Cdc12 at the di - vision site de novo ( Wu et al . , 2006 ; Vavylonis et al . , 2008 ; Coffman et al . , 2009 ; Laporte et al . , 2011 ) and cortical filaments assembled by Cdc12 and transported to the division site ( Huang et al . , 2012 ) may both contribute to contractile ring assembly . Search , capture , pull , and release ( SCPR ) is a stochastic ring assembly model by which Cdc12 assembles ∼ 1 - μm - long filaments de novo from precur - sor nodes that are captured by myosin - II motors on neighboring nodes ( Vavylonis et al . , 2008 ; Coffman et al . , 2009 ; Laporte et al . , 2011 ) . Inadequate profilins may not allow Cdc12 to produce fila - ments quickly enough to facilitate sufficient connections between nodes ( Vavylonis et al . , 2008 ) . In the absence of precursor nodes , Cdc12 assembles actin filaments for contractile rings de novo from one or a few spots via a pathway that depends on the septation initiation network ( Hachet and Simanis , 2008 ; Huang et al . , 2008 ; FIGURE 3 : ScPFY ( 9 - Mut ) rescues cytokinesis defects of cdc3 - 124 cells .

J . Bestul , J . R . Christensen , et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell Roberts - Galbraith and Gould , 2008 ; Saha and Pollard , 2012 ) . The actin assembly parameters of Cdc12 ( number of filaments and their elongation rate ) have not been well defined for node - independent pathways . However , it is reasonable to assume that these mecha - nisms also require a sufficient number of rapidly elongating actin filaments for proper ring assembly ( Hachet and Simanis , 2008 ; Huang et al . , 2008 , 2012 ; Saha and Pollard , 2012 ) . What role in formin - mediated actin assembly is rescued by ScPFY ( 9 - Mut ) ? Profilin is believed to increase the elongation rate of formin - asso - ciated actin filaments by increasing the local actin concentration and orienting actin monomers to the barbed end of the growing actin filament ( Figure 6C ; Romero et al . , 2004 ; Kovar et al . , 2006 ; Vavylonis et al . , 2006 ) . FH1 and FH2 domains have been pro - posed to play distinct but complementary roles in the assembly of profilin - actin ( Figure 6C ; Kovar et al . , 2006 ; Vavylonis et al . , 2006 ; Paul and Pollard , 2008 ; Courtemanche and Pollard , 2012 ) . The FH2 domain remains processively associated with the elon - gating F - actin barbed end , whereas the FH1 do main binds profi - lin - actin and transfers it to the FH2 domain – associated barbed end ( Chang et al . , 1997 ; Kovar et al . , 2003 ; Yonetani et al . , 2008 ) . Profilin then dissociates from both the FH1 domain and the barbed end to allow additional rounds of actin monomer addition . However , this model does not explain several experimental re - sults that implicate a direct involvement of the FH2 domain in formin - mediated assembly of profilin - actin . First , both the FH1 and FH2 domains contribute to the preference of specific formin iso - forms for actin bound to particular profilin isoforms ( Neidt et al . , 2009 ) . Second , the FH2 domain influences the degree to which formins select against labeled actin in the presence of profilin ( Scott et al . , 2011 ) . Third , it has been documented multiple times that the FH2 domain influences the elongation rate of profilin - actin ( Paul and Pollard , 2008 ; Neidt et al . , 2009 ; Vidali et al . , 2009 ; Scott et al . , 2011 ) . Therefore the FH2 domain appears to have a direct influence on profilin - actin elongation , which we hypothesize occurs through a novel profilin – FH2 domain interaction ( Figure 6C ) . Considering that the nine mutations in ScPFY ( 9 - Mut ) do not alter the affinity for either the proline - rich FH1 domain or G - actin ( Table 1 ) , we suspect that the mutations rescue an as - yet - undefined interaction with the FH2 domain . We predict that profilin binds the FH2 domain quite weakly , which prevents free profilin or profilin - actin from associating with the FH2 domain but allows interaction when profilin - actin is tethered to the FH1 domain in the “ring complex” during processive elongation ( Figure 6C ) . This is consistent with our failure to detect interactions between profilin and the FH2 by simple pull - down assays ( unpub - lished data ) . It is possible that association of profilin or profilin - actin with the FH2 domain contributes to the addition of new actin mono - mers to the barbed end ( Figure 6C , step 3 ) and / or contributes to the dissociation of profilin from the formin - associated barbed end FIGURE 4 : Enhancement of actin assembly with formin Cdc12 correlates with profilin’s ability to complement profilin mutant cdc3 - 124 cells .

Volume 26 January 15 , 2015 Primary role of fission yeast profilin | 289 Profilin also has a role in Arp2 / 3 complex – mediated endocytic actin patches Although endocytosis is not significantly perturbed in profilin mu - tant cdc3 - 124 cells ( Figure 2 ) , the kinetics of Arp2 / 3 complex - me - diated actin patches is disrupted . Time - lapse fluorescence micros - copy of actin patches revealed that compared with wild - type cells , cdc3 - 124 cells at the semipermissive temperature of 33 . 5°C con - tain approximately threefold more F - actin and internalize one - third as well ( Suarez et al . , 2015 ) . The accumulation of additional F - actin can explain slower actin patch migration , since cofilin - me - diated filament severing is critical for actin patch internalization ( Okreglak and Drubin , 2007 ; Berro et al . , 2010 ) . Given that actin patches in cdc3 - 124 cells contain more F - actin , we hypothesized that an additional role of profilin is to limit Arp2 / 3 complex – medi - ated actin assembly . Furthermore , an antagonistic relationship between profilin and Arp2 / 3 complex has been revealed geneti - cally , by which mutations in the Arp2 / 3 complex components sop2 , arp2 , and arp3 suppress the profilin cdc3 - 124 mutation ( Balasubramanian et al . , 1996 ; McCollum et al . , 1996 ; Morrell et al . , 1999 ) . We discovered that profilin directly inhibits actin branch formation by Arp2 / 3 complex , which is necessary for ( Figure 6C , steps 4 and 5 ) . Aligning crystal structures of actin in complex with either profilin or the budding yeast formin Bni1 FH2 domain suggests that the FH2 domain and profilin may both con - tact the most recently added actin subunit at similar positions ( Otomo et al . , 2005 ; Vavylonis et al . , 2006 ) . If profilin remains bound to the ultimate actin subunit while the FH2 domain translocates to the barbed end , the backbones of the FH2 domain and profilin might be in close contact ; such a clash could explain why mathemat - ical models of formin - mediated elongation of profilin - actin require the use of a dissociation constant that is substantially higher than that measured for the isolated profilin - actin interaction ( Vavylonis et al . , 2006 ) . Strikingly , this putative profilin – FH2 domain interaction is predicted to overlap with the site of the nine mutations in ScPFY ( 9 - Mut ) . Thus this interface might be finely tuned to specific formin and profilin isoform pairs that are tailored for rapid actin assembly . The profilin - FH2 domain interaction is predicted to occur in the “stair - stepping” model of formin - mediated actin filament elonga - tion ( Xu et al . , 2004 ; Otomo et al . , 2005 ; Mizuno et al . , 2011 ) but not the “stepping second” model , in which profilin dissociates before the FH2 domain translocates to the ultimate actin subunit ( Paul and Pollard , 2009a , b ) .

Differential interference contrast ( DIC ) and epifluorescence images were collected on an Orca - ER camera ( Hamamatsu , Bridgewater , NJ ) on an IX - 81 microscope ( Olympus , Tokyo , Japan ) , with a 60 × / 1 . 4 numerical aperture ( NA ) Plan Apo objective . Confocal images were collected on a Cascade 512BT camera ( Photometrics , Tucson , AZ ) on a Zeiss Axioimager M1 – equipped 63 × / 1 . 4 NA oil - immersion lens and a Yokogawa CSU - X1 spinning - disk unit ( Solamere , Salt Lake City , UT ) . Nuclei and septa were visualized with 4 ′ , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( DAPI ) ( nuclei ) and calcofluor ( septa ; Kovar et al . , 2003 ) and quantified for at least 200 cells . Cells were grown for 48 h in EMM5S before visualization of contractile rings . Integrated profilins under control of the P81nmt1 promoter were expressed by growing cells for 24 h in EMM5S after the re - moval of thiamine ( 5 μg / ml ) . Cells were grown for an additional 2 h at 32 or 36°C before imaging . For contractile ring movies , cells formin Cdc12 - mediated contractile ring assembly ( Suarez et al . , 2015 ) . Therefore , in addition to profilin’s essential role in facilitat - ing contractile ring assembly by Cdc12 for cytokinesis , profilin is also required for yeast cells to maintain the proper density and size of diverse homeostatic F - actin networks ( Burke et al . , 2014 ; Suarez et al . , 2015 ) . Even though fission yeast cells have relatively few F - actin net - works ( Kovar et al . , 2011 ) , the single profilin isoform has at least two distinct roles . Higher eukaryotes express multiple profilin iso - forms and contain a far higher number of different filament net - works , which depend on a diverse array of nucleation factors ( Chhabra and Higgs , 2007 ; Chesarone and Goode , 2009 ; Dominguez , 2009 ) . Previous work in our lab revealed that the worm formin CYK - 1 differently utilizes the three worm profilins in vitro ( Neidt et al . , 2009 ) . There is also growing evidence that form - ins ( Khadka et al . , 2009 ) or Ena / VASP proteins ( Mouneimne et al . , 2012 ) utilize profilin isoforms differently in vivo . Thus profilin isoforms may be sophisticated regulators of actin nucleation fac - tors for diverse cellular processes . FIGURE 6 : TIRF microscopy of formin - mediated assembly of profilin - actin .

Ca - ATP actin was purified from chicken skeletal muscle as described ( Neidt et al . , 2008 ) . Gel - filtered actin was la - beled on Cys - 374 with pyrenyl iodoacetamide or Oregon Green iodoacetamide ( Life Technologies - Invitrogen , Grand Island , NY ; Kovar et al . , 2003 ) . Immediately before each experiment , Ca - ATP actin was converted to Mg - ATP actin by addition of 0 . 1 volume of 2 mM ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid ( EGTA ) and 0 . 5 mM MgCl 2 for 2 min at 25°C . Extinction coefficients for Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) ( 51 , 255 M − 1 ; Kovar et al . , 2003 ) , SpPRF ( 20 , 065 M − 1 ; Lu and Pol - lard , 2001 ) , SjPRF ( 19 , 940 M − 1 ) , ScPFY ( 19 , 940 M − 1 ; Haarer et al . , 1990 ) , AtPRF1 ( 17 , 085 M − 1 ; Christensen et al . , 1996 ) , CePFN - 1 ( 18 , 450 M − 1 ; Polet et al . , 2006 ) , MmPRF1 ( 21 , 600 M − 1 ) , and HsPRO1 ( 18 , 500 M − 1 ; Metzler et al . , 1994 ) were estimated from the amino acid composition . Fluorescence spectroscopy Spontaneous and seeded actin assembly was measured from the fluorescence of pyrene - actin ( excitation at 364 nm and emission at 407 nm ) with a Safire 2 ( Tecan , Durham , NC ) fluorescence plate reader as described previously ( Neidt et al . , 2008 ) . Final protein concentrations are indicated in the figure legends . Conditions were as follows : 10 mM imidazole , pH 7 . 0 , 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 5 mM DTT , 0 . 2 mM ATP , and 90 μM CaCl 2 . Profilin K d values were determined by fitting the spontaneous actin assembly data to an exponential decay equation . Profilin’s affinity for PLP ( Sigma - Aldrich ) or Cdc12 ( FH1 ) was de - termined by measuring profilin’s intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence with excitation at 295 nm and emission at 323 nm ( Neidt et al . , 2009 ) . Profilin ( 1 . 0 μM ) was incubated with a range of PLP or Cdc12 ( FH1 ) concentrations for 30 min at room temperature and the fluorescence read in a Safire 2 plate reader . Plots of the dependence of the concentration of bound profilin on the concentration of PLP or Cdc12 ( FH1 ) were fitted with a quadratic equation to determine K d values . Profilin’s stability was measured by denaturation with urea ( Lu and Pollard , 2001 ) . Profilin ( 1 . 0 μM ) was incubated with a range of urea concentrations for 30 min at room temperature , and the fluorescence ( excitation , 295 nm ; emission , 370 nm ) was read in the Safire 2 plate reader . The reported values are an average of three independent experiments . Profilin’s effect on the exchange the nucleotide of the actin mono - mer was measured by the loss of ε ATP fluorescence with excitation at 360 nm and emission at 410 nm ( Lu and Pollard , 2001 ) . Muscle actin was incubated with AG1 - x4 resin ( Bio - Rad , Hercules , CA ) at 4ºC for 30 min to remove ATP . ε ATP Mg - actin was made by adding 400 μM ε ATP , 200 μM EGTA , and 50 μM MgCl 2 to the resin - treated actin for 50 min at 4ºC . Excess ε ATP was removed by incubation with AG1 - x4 resin for 30 min at 4ºC . ε ATP fluorescence after the addition of 500 μM unlabeled ATP was plotted versus time . The time to half - maximal fluorescence was plotted versus profilin concentration . Fission yeast actin pull - down assay Fission yeast cells were grown to OD 595 of ∼ 1 . 7 at 25ºC . The cells were harvested , washed with water and phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) , resuspended in PBS , and broken open by a FastPrep - 24 benchtop homogenizer ( MP Biomedicals , Santa Ana , CA ) after add - ing ∼ 0 . 3 g of acid - washed glass beads ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . The homoge - nate was clarified at 13 , 000 rpm for 15 min at 4ºC and at 50 , 000 rpm for 30 min at 4ºC . The supernatant was incubated with 25 μl of bed volume PLP - Sepharose beads and a range of concentrations of were imaged on EMM5S - agar ( 2 . 5 % ) pads containing 0 . 1 mM n - propyl gallate . Contractile rings from a single Z - plane were visual - ized with Rlc1 - GFP every minute . Endocytosis defects were deter - mined by acquiring confocal Z - series ( 0 . 50 - μm intervals spanning the entire cell ) of GFP - Syb1 after incubating cells for 2 h at the in - dicated temperatures . Stock solutions of 10 mM CK - 666 ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide . A 500 - μl amount of exponentially growing cells ( OD of 0 . 2 – 0 . 6 ) was incubated in a 1 . 5 - ml tube for 30 min with 100 μM CK - 666 . For experiments at restrictive temperature , cells were preincubated at the indicated temperature for 2 h , followed by an additional 30 min with 100 μM CK - 666 ( Burke et al . , 2014 ) . Fluorescence intensity at the ends of the cells was normalized to background fluorescence and quantified using ImageJ ( National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , MD ) . ScPFY mutant library construction A combinatorial budding yeast profilin ScPFY mutant library was constructed by PCR mutagenesis ( Yuan et al . , 2005 ) . ScPFY was di - vided into ten 60 - mer primers ( IDT , Coralville , IA ) that overlapped by 20 base pairs at both ends . Primers contained a 50 / 50 mix of the ScPFY and SpPRF base for each of 16 variable positions ( theoretical library size , 2 16 = 65 , 536 ) . After an initial PCR with Taq polymerase ( New England BioLabs , Ipswich , MA ) and all 10 primers , the prod - ucts were used as a template for a second clean - up PCR using an 8 : 2 ratio of Taq polymerase to Pfu Turbo ( Agilent Technologies - Stratagene , Santa Clara , CA ) with only the outermost primers . The final products were cloned into the S . pombe pREP81 expression vector by restriction digest and ligation . The pREP81 - ScPFY library was electroporated into S . pombe cdc3 - 124 cells , plated on EMM5S - leu media for 2 d at 25°C , and then transferred to 36°C for 3 d . Of 192 colonies recovered from ∼ 500 , 000 mutant profilins , 17 were selected for further study after retesting their ability to complement the cdc3 - 124 strain at 36°C . Recovered plasmids were sequenced ( Table 1 ) . ScPFY ( 9 - Mut ) was constructed by the same two - step PCR method . Bacterial expres - sion constructs ( pMW ) for profilin were prepared by standard clon - ing procedures . Immunoblotting To determine level of detection of SpPRF , ScPFY , or ScPFY ( 9 - Mut ) profilins by α - SpPRF antibody ( Lu and Pollard , 2001 ) , 1 . 0 μg of each purified profilin was run on an SDS – PAGE gel , transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane , and probed with α - SpPRF and IRDye 800 CW goat anti - mouse immunoglobulin G secondary an - tibody ( LI - COR Biosciences , Lincoln , NE ) . Optical density normal - ized to Coomassie - stained gel was quantified using ImageJ . To determine profilin expression levels in fission yeast cells , wild - type cells , cdc3 - 124 cells , or cdc3 - 124 cells expressing integrated Sp - PRF , ScPFY , or ScPFY ( 9 - Mutant ) under the low - strength P81nmt1 promoter were grown overnight at 25°C , then rinsed three times with EMM5S without thiamine and grown in EMM5S without thia - mine at 25°C for 24 h . Cells were then grown at 32°C for 2 h before being broken open by glass bead lysis in a FastPrep - 24 ( MP Bio - medicals , Solon , OH ) in profilin buffer ( 20 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM KCl , 0 . 2 mM dithiothreitol [ DTT ] ) and Complete protease inhibitors ( Roche , Fishers , IN ) . A Bradford assay was used to deter - mine total protein concentration with equal amounts loaded and separated on an SDS – PAGE gel , transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride ( PVDF ) membrane , and probed with α - SpPRF . Profilin amounts in different cell types were quantified relative to the wild - type using ImageJ ( Burke et al . , 2014 ) . 292 | A . J . Bestul , J . R . Christensen , et al .

PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding Profilin’s ability to bind PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 micelles was assayed by micro - filtration ( Haarer et al . , 1993 ; Lambrechts et al . , 1997 ) . PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( Sigma - Aldrich ) micelles were prepared at a concentration of 1 mg / ml in water by water bath sonication for 5 min at room tem - perature . A range of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 micelle concentrations was incu - bated with 2 . 5 μM profilin for 2 h at 4ºC . The samples were then transferred to Amicon Ultracel membranes ( Millipore , Billerica , MA ) with a molecular weight cutoff of 30 , 000 Da . The samples were cen - trifuged through the membranes for 1 min at 2000 rpm . The flowthrough was collected , run on a 15 % SDS – PAGE gel , and stained with Coomassie Blue . The intensity of the profilin bands was measured by an Odyssey infrared imager ( LI - COR ) . TIRF microscopy TIRF images of Oregon Green – labeled Mg - ATP actin excited by evanescent wave fluorescence were acquired every 10 s on an IX - 71 microscope ( Olympus ) fitted with through - the - objective TIRF illumi - nation and an iXon electron - multiplying charge - coupled device camera ( Andor Technology , South Windsor , CT ) as described previ - ously ( Neidt et al . , 2008 ) . A mixture of 1 . 0 μM unlabeled Mg - ATP actin and 0 . 5 μM ( 33 % ) Mg - ATP Oregon Green actin was mixed with 2 × TIRF buffer ( 1 × : 10 mM imidazole , pH 7 . 0 , 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 50 mM DTT , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 50 μM CaCl 2 , 15 mM glucose , 20 μg / ml catalase , 100 μg / ml glucose oxidase , and 0 . 5 % [ 500 cp ] methylcellulose ) and formin alone or with profilin and trans - ferred to a flow cell for imaging .
