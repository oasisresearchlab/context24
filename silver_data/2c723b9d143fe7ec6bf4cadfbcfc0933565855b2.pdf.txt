Vesicular stomatitis virus ( VSV ) , an enveloped virus with bullet - shaped virions that measure 70 6 200 nm , enters cells by clathrin - dependent endocytosis . We showed previously that VSV particles exceed the capacity of typical clathrin - coated vesicles and instead enter through endocytic carriers that acquire a partial clathrin coat and require local actin filament assembly to complete vesicle budding and internalization . To understand why the actin system is required for VSV uptake , we compared the internalization mechanisms of VSV and its shorter ( 75 nm long ) defective interfering particle , DI - T . By imaging the uptake of individual particles into live cells , we found that , as with parental virions , DI - T enters via the clathrin endocytic pathway . Unlike VSV , DI - T internalization occurs through complete clathrin - coated vesicles and does not require actin polymerization . Since VSV and DI - T particles display similar surface densities of the same attachment glycoprotein , we conclude that the physical properties of the particle dictate whether a virus - containing clathrin pit engages the actin system . We suggest that the elongated shape of a VSV particle prevents full enclosure by the clathrin coat and that stalling of coat assembly triggers recruitment of the actin machinery to finish the internalization process . Since some enveloped viruses have pleomorphic particle shapes and sizes , our work suggests that they may use altered modes of endocytic uptake . More generally , our findings show the importance of cargo geometry for specifying cellular entry modes , even when the receptor recognition properties of a ligand are maintained .

The most prominent and well - characterized endocytic carriers are clathrin - coated vesicles ( reviewed in [ 1 – 3 ] ) . Coated vesicles transport lipids , proteins , and other essential macromolecules from the cell surface to endosomal organelles . Extensive biochemical and cell biological research supports the following model for conventional coated vesicle formation in higher eukaryotes . The AP - 2 clathrin adaptor complex recruits clathrin to the cytosolic leaflet of the plasma membrane and sequesters cargos at the endocytic site [ 4 , 5 ] . The continued assembly of clathrin into a lattice - like configuration helps deform the underlying membrane and ultimately creates an invagination , or ‘pit’ [ 2 ] . Recruitment of the GTPase , dynamin , then facilitates scission of the coated pit from the plasma membrane [ 6 ] , and clathrin is rapidly removed from the cargo - loaded vesicle by the combined action of the heat shock cognate protein 70 ( Hsc70 ) and its co - chaperone auxilin [ 7 , 8 ] . The entire process is typically complete within 30 – 60 s [ 9 , 10 ] . Coated pits incorporate and internalize soluble cargos of various sizes , such as transferrin ( 5 nm ) [ 9 , 11 ] and low density lipoproteins ( 25 nm ) [ 9 , 12 ] . Many viruses and intracellular bacteria are also internalized by the clathrin machinery [ 9 , 13 – 16 ] . We previously evaluated how cells internalize the 70 6 200 nm bullet - shaped vesicular stomatitis virus ( VSV ) . We found that VSV internalization occurs through elongated , partially clathrin - coated structures that have longer lifetimes ( , 2 min . ) than typical endocytic clathrin - coated vesicles and require local actin polymerization for uptake [ 15 ] . During VSV internalization , the clathrin coat first assembles as a partially closed dome at one end of the virion [ 15 , 17 ] , and growth of the coat stalls when it encounters the long particle axis . Actin assembly then drives one or more late stage ( s ) of the internalization process , as recruitment of the actin machinery peaks during completion of clathrin assembly , and pharmacological inhibition of actin polymerization blocks VSV internalization without interfering with clathrin coat assembly [ 15 ] . Relatively small , spherical viruses like dengue virus ( 50 nm ) [ 13 ] and some influenza A viruses ( X - 31 strain , , 120 nm ) [ 14 , 18 ] also enter using a clathrin - dependent route , but it is unclear whether actin function is required for their uptake . Our observations with VSV led us to PLoS Pathogens | www . plospathogens . org 1 September 2010 | Volume 6 | Issue 9 | e1001127 hypothesize that the physical dimensions of the virion block the ongoing polymerization of clathrin during its uptake , and that the stalled structure recruits regulators of actin assembly whose activity is required to complete the internalization process . Defective interfering ( DI ) particles arise spontaneously during virus replication . Such particles depend upon coinfecting helper virus to support their replication but contain all the essential cis - acting regulatory elements for genome replication and assembly . One such well - characterized DI particle of VSV is termed DI - T , which lacks 82 % of the viral genome [ 19 , 20 ] . Since the length of a VSV particle is dictated by the genome size [ 21 ] , DI - T particles are 75 nm long and appear as truncated bullets by electron microscopy [ 22 ] . DI - T particles contain normal proportions of the viral structural proteins [ 23 ] , including the viral surface glycopro - tein ( G ) , which mediates VSV attachment and entry into host cells . Here we took advantage of significant differences in the physical dimensions of VSV and DI - T to investigate how the geometry of a viral cargo influences the actin - dependency of clathrin internal - ization . Using live cell fluorescence microscopic imaging , we compared the uptake mechanisms of VSV and DI - T at the single particle level . We report that in contrast to the clathrin - and actin - dependent uptake of VSV , the shorter DI - T particles enter cells through fully coated clathrin carriers that do not require actin dynamics for vesicle budding . These observations highlight the plasticity of the clathrin endocytic system , where clathrin coats serve as a scaffold to direct actin assembly when the clathrin machinery alone is not sufficient to mediate internalization . Results Biological properties of DI - T particles To generate a clonal population of VSV DI - T particles , we recovered DI - T from cDNA ( Figure 1A ) [ 24 ] and amplified the particles by co - infection of cells with VSV [ 25 ] . We separated DI - T particles from VSV by rate zonal centrifugation in a sucrose density gradient . Electron microscopic analysis ( Figure 1B , C ) confirmed that VSV virions measure 70 + / 2 8 nm by 204 + / 2 14 nm ( n = 114 ) [ 21 ] , while the shorter DI - T particles have a length of 76 + / 2 8 nm ( n = 81 ) [ 22 ] . DI - T particles , like VSV , are covered with spike - like projections that correspond to homotrimers of G protein ( Figure 1B ) , and SDS - PAGE analysis of purified particles confirmed that VSV and DI - T particles contain similar ratios of G protein to core virion components ( Figure 1D ) [ 23 ] . The purified stocks of DI - T lacked full - length virions ( Figure 1B ) , with only a single VSV virion observed amongst more than 3 , 000 DI - T particles . Limited dilutions of the purified DI - T stock contained , 1x10 6 plaque forming units of virus per microgram of total viral protein , or 10 - 5 times fewer infectious particles than for an equivalent protein quantity of VSV particles ( not shown ) . Thus , we have successfully purified relatively homogeneous populations of VSV and DI - T particles , which differ only in their physical dimensions . DI - T particles enter cells by clathrin - dependent endocytosis To visualize VSV and DI - T by fluorescence microscopy , we covalently labeled the G proteins with spectrally separable fluorescent dye molecules ( Alexa Fluor 568 and 647 , respectively ) using conditions that do not reduce viral infectivity [ 15 ] . Spinning disk confocal images of labeled particles adsorbed onto glass coverslips showed diffraction - limited objects with single - peaked distributions of fluorescence intensity values ( Figure 1E ) , indicating that the DI - T and VSV populations primarily consist of individual particles [ 15 ] . We tracked the entry of DI - T particles into BSC1 cells stably expressing an eGFP - tagged s 2 subunit of the AP - 2 adaptor complex ( s 2 - eGFP ) , which incorporates into all clathrin - coated structures that form on the plasma membrane [ 9 , 15 , 26 ] . Single DI - T particles readily attached to cells and progressed through the following set of defined events ( see Figures 2A , B ; Video S1 for examples ) : ( 1 ) membrane - bound DI - T particles diffused slowly ( D = 5 6 10 2 11 – 5 6 10 2 12 cm 2 s 2 1 ) and with the random directionality characteristic of Brownian motion ; ( 2 ) shortly after DI - T attachment , a dim spot of AP - 2 signal arose and remained colocalized with the particle , signifying incorporation of DI - T into an assembling clathrin - coated pit ; ( 3 ) the AP - 2 signal steadily increased over time until it peaked as coat assembly completed , and the DI - T particle then underwent an abrupt movement into the cell , after which the AP - 2 signal disappeared due to clathrin uncoating . This sequence of events is identical to what we previously observed for VSV entering cells by clathrin - dependent endocytosis [ 15 ] . Moreover , the efficiency of DI - T uptake via the clathrin pathway is similar to that of the full - length VSV particles , as 89 % ( 55 / 62 ) of DI - T particles that attached to 3 individual cells during imaging entered by clathrin - dependent endocytosis . These data show that DI - T efficiently enters cells through the clathrin pathway and validate the use of DI - T and VSV as comparative endocytic cargos . Clathrin structures capture VSV and DI - T particles with similar kinetics To directly compare how DI - T and VSV particles engage the clathrin machinery , we simultaneously inoculated BSC1 cells with the two spectrally distinct particle forms and then analyzed their mode of incorporation into AP - 2 containing clathrin structures on a single cell basis ( Figure 2C ) . For each complete virus uptake event , we quantified the kinetics of particle capture by measuring the elapsed time between virion attachment and the appearance of an AP - 2 signal that colocalized with the bound particle . The capture time for DI - T particles was 110 + / 2 80 s ( n = 121 ) , which is statistically indistinguishable ( Student’s t - test , p = 0 . 2 ) to that measured for VSV ( 130 + / 2 125 s ( n = 87 ) ) and agrees well with our prior measurements ( Figure 2D ) [ 15 ] . The AP - 2 structures that captured DI - T or VSV initiated within a , 250 nm zone ( the resolution limit of the optical system ) of the attached particle . We therefore conclude that DI - T and VSV particles engage the clathrin system in an indistinguishable manner , which likely reflects a shared mechanism triggered by the same viral glycoprotein - receptor interactions . Author Summary We present a detailed comparison between the clathrin - dependent entry mechanisms of a parental virus ( VSV ) and its smaller defective interfering particle ( DI - T ) . We used the difference in virion length to probe why actin assembly is required for the uptake of full - length VSV particles by nonpolarized mammalian cells . By imaging the entry of single particles in an unbiased manner , we resolved differences in the maturation kinetics , clathrin content , and actin dependency of clathrin endocytic structures internalizing VSV or DI - T virions . Our principal finding is that , unlike VSV uptake , DI - T internalization does not induce or require robust actin polymerization . We have also established , for the first time , that the geometry of an endocytic cargo can alter the mechanism of clathrin uptake . We propose that VSV - containing clathrin struc - tures display characteristics of ‘frustrated’ endocytic intermediates that cells resolve by using the force of actin assembly to deform the plasma membrane into a complete endocytic vesicle . Virus Length Alters Clathrin - Dependent Endocytosis PLoS Pathogens | www . plospathogens . org 2 September 2010 | Volume 6 | Issue 9 | e1001127 Cells internalize DI - T particles using conventional clathrin - coated vesicles To investigate the characteristics of the clathrin coat responsible for DI - T internalization , we imaged the uptake of both particle forms by the same BSC1 cell . We found that DI - T particles are internalized through AP - 2 containing structures significantly faster than full - length virions ( Figure 3A , B ; Video S2 ) . Quantitative analysis of data compiled from 4 cells showed that pits incorporating DI - T ( n = 36 ) form in 43 + / 2 14 s , which is similar to the assembly kinetics of pits that lack virus particles ( n = 212 , 35 + / 2 10 s ) ( Figure 3C , Table 1 ) . As expected , AP - 2 structures that capture VSV ( n = 29 ) require longer ( 75 + / 2 22 s ) to complete ( Figure 3C , Table 1 ) . A similar analysis conducted in cells transiently expressing eGFP - tagged clathrin light chain A1 ( eGFP - LCa ) yielded analogous results ( Figure 3D , E , Table 1 , Videos S3 , S4 ) . The interaction of full - length VSV with a cell had no impact on the uptake kinetics of DI - T into the same cell ( Table 1 ) . The different kinetics of DI - T versus VSV internalization suggests that DI - T enters cells through conventional fully coated clathrin structures and not the partially coated vesicles responsible for VSV uptake . To further investigate this possibility , we measured the maximum fluorescent signal of eGFP - tagged AP - 2 or clathrin molecules , as this peak signal is known to be proportional to the overall size of a clathrin coat [ 9 , 15 , 26 ] . We compared this value for structures that contained DI - T with those that contained VSV or lacked either particle . Similar quantities of coat components were present in structures associated with DI - T to those lacking viral particles ( Figure 3C , E , Table 1 ) . As expected , VSV - containing structures accumulate more AP - 2 and LCa molecules than structures lacking virus ( Figure 3C , E , Table 1 ) . Taken together , the above experiments suggest that DI - T enters cells through pits that acquire a full clathrin coat . Consistent with this , electron micrographs of DI - T particles captured during cell entry show particles present in circular pits entirely surrounded by a clathrin coat ( Figure 4A ) . This is in marked contrast to the partial clathrin coat found at one end of the endocytic carriers that internalize VSV ( Figure 4B ) [ 15 ] . Clathrin structures containing VSV recruit more cortactin that pits that internalize DI - T During the final phase of coat assembly , endocytic clathrin structures associated with VSV show a strong recruitment of cortactin , an F - actin and dynamin binding protein that activates Arp2 / 3 - mediated assembly of branched actin filaments [ 15 , 27 , 28 ] . To determine whether DI - T uptake is associated with an acute recruitment of cortactin , we monitored internalization Figure 1 . Biological properties of DI - T particles .

As previously shown [ 15 , 26 , 29 ] , conventional clathrin - coated pits exhibit minimal cortactin recruitment that typically peaks just before completion of clathrin assembly ( Figure 5A , Video S5 ) . Cortactin recruitment is similarly sparse during the uptake of DI - T particles ( Figure 5B , Video S6 ) . In marked contrast , and as expected [ 15 ] , large bursts of cortactin accompany the internalization of VSV ( Figure 5C , Video S7 ) . Quantitative analysis revealed that the peak fluorescence intensity of cortactin detected in the late phase of VSV uptake averaged 3 - fold higher than the signal associated with pits containing DI - T or pits that did not capture a virus particle ( Figure 5D , Table 1 ) . These data suggest that while formation of short - branched actin filaments is required during the late stages of clathrin - mediated VSV entry , this need is obviated during clathrin - dependent DI - T entry . Actin polymerization is not required for DI - T internalization To directly test whether actin assembly is required for DI - T entry , we treated BSC1 cells with latrunculin B ( latB ) , a chemical inhibitor of actin filament assembly [ 30 ] , and tracked the endocytic fate of DI - T and VSV in the same cells . Treatment of cells with 6 . 3 m M latB did not change the efficiency of DI - T entry ( Figure 6A – C , Video S8 ) , but it reduced the internalization of VSV by . 75 % ( Figure 6A – C ) . As expected [ 15 ] , latB treatment did not affect the capture efficiency of either particle type by clathrin ( Figure 6C ) . The lifetimes and AP - 2 content of pits lacking particles or containing DI - T was similarly unaffected by latB ( Figure 6D ) . We conclude that the shorter DI - T particles bypass the actin requirement displayed by the larger VSV for efficient clathrin - based uptake . Figure 2 . Clathrin structures capture VSV and DI - T particles with similar kinetics . ( A ) Schematic of clathrin - dependent virus internalization . 1 . A particle ( blue ) attaches to receptor moieties ( orange ) on the cell surface ( black horizontal line ) , and the virus - receptor complex diffuses in the plane of the membrane . 2 . The virus particle is captured by the clathrin endocytic machinery ( AP - 2 , green ; clathrin , red ) after diffusion into an existing clathrin structure ( e . g . Dengue virus ) or entrapment within a clathrin structure that initiates in close proximity to the virion ( e . g . VSV and influenza A virus ) . 3 . Clathrin assembly completes , and the virus - containing pit is severed from the cell surface in a dynamin - dependent process . Internalization of VSV also requires local actin assembly . Clathrin is rapidly removed from the nascent vesicle , and the vesicle is actively transported further into cell . ( B ) Example of a complete DI - T internalization event . A single DI - T particle ( red ) attaches to a BSC1 cell expressing s 2 - eGFP ( green ) and diffuses on the cell surface . A dim spot of AP - 2 appears beneath the virion , signifying capture of the particle . The AP - 2 fluorescence intensity increases as the clathrin coat assembles , and the virus disappears into the cell shortly after the AP - 2 signal reaches a maximum ( Video S1 ) . Numbered stages correspond to the events described in A . The path of particle motion is depicted as a linear , color - coded trace that progresses with time from blue to red .

We formulate this conclusion based on tracking the clathrin - depen - dent internalization of VSV and its shorter DI - T particle into live cells . Internalization of VSV is accompanied by the recruitment of Figure 3 . Cells internalize DI - T particles using conventional clathrin - coated vesicles . ( A ) Internalization of VSV and DI - T by the same cell . BSC1 cells stably expressing s 2 - eGFP ( green ) were inoculated with VSV ( red ) and DI - T ( blue ) particles , and confocal images were captured at 4 s intervals . The images show the sequential internalization of single VSV ( red , red arrowheads ) and DI - T ( blue , blue arrowheads ) particles , followed by the formation of a canonical coated vesicle ( white arrowhead ) within a 3 . 5 6 3 . 5 m m 2 area of the plasma membrane ( Video S2 ) .

Values are expressed as percentages to facilitate comparison of viral and nonviral uptake events across multiple cells . Approximately 50 pits lacking virus were analyzed in each cell , and the mean of the measured values was calculated for each parameter . The values for each nonviral and viral uptake event were divided by the mean for pits lacking virus in the same cell , and the resulting values were multiplied by 100 .

By contrast , internalization of the shorter DI - T particles is insensitive to chemical inhibition of actin polymerization and is not accompanied by the same spike of cortactin recruitment observed for the full - length VSV particles . VSV and DI - T particles differ in their length and not the density of the glycoprotein spike that dictates their entry . We suggest that the shape of the full - length VSV particles presents a physical barrier that frustrates completion of the clathrin - coated pit . The stalled clathrin structure then recruits the actin machinery required to finalize internalization . The shorter DI - T particles no longer provide such a physical barrier during engulfment , which results in their actin - independent internalization through coated vesicles that acquire a full complement of clathrin . The importance of particle length for the clathrin - dependent uptake of VSV Receptor - dependent signaling events lead to actin filament assembly during the clathrin - independent uptake of other viruses , including poliovirus and coxsackie B virus [ 31 , 32 ] . Here we show that the initial interactions of DI - T with the cell are indistinguish - able to those of VSV , as both particle types diffuse slowly on the cell surface and are captured by coated pits with similar kinetics ( Figure 2 ) . Such similar behavior suggests that DI - T and VSV engage an as yet unknown viral receptor in an analogous manner . Since initial receptor interactions appear indistinguishable , it seems remote that VSV G - receptor interactions induce a signaling cascade that leads to actin polymerization at sites of VSV but not DI - T uptake . We therefore conclude that the glycoprotein is not the primary trigger of actin assembly during clathrin - dependent VSV internalization . We previously showed that endocytic structures containing VSV do not acquire a full clathrin coat [ 15 ] , which agreed with earlier electron micrographs depicting virus particles in tubular invagi - nations with clathrin at the cytosolic tip [ 17 ] . The morphology of those structures suggests that cells initially capture one tip of the virus particle , and clathrin assembly stalls when the constricting coat encounters the long axis of the virion ( Figure 7 ) . Here we found that DI - T particles do not alter the process of clathrin - coated vesicle formation ( Figures 3 , 4 ) . This finding implies that clathrin can fully enclose cargos displaying VSV G provided that the particle shape does not physically prohibit clathrin assembly or closure of the plasma membrane ( Figure 7 ) . Consequently , the physical properties of the VSV particle captured by a clathrin - coated pit are what dictate the altered mode of actin - dependent uptake . We therefore propose the model ( Figure 7 ) that it is the incomplete clathrin structure formed during VSV uptake that elicits the actin - based response to rescue the endocytic process and leads to the successful engulfment of the trapped virus particle . Actin - dependent clathrin - mediated endocytosis The importance of actin function during clathrin - mediated endocytosis varies . In yeast cells , actin polymerization drives invagination and endocytosis of long - lived ( . 2 min . ) clathrin assemblies through tubular intermediates with clathrin at the cytosolic tip [ 33 – 35 ] . Mammalian cells also form large ( 0 . 2 – 1 m m ) , relatively flat arrays of clathrin , or ‘plaques , ’ on the adherent cell surface [ 26 , 36 ] . These structures also exhibit long lifetimes ( 2 - 15 + min . ) and require local actin assembly for internalization [ 26 ] . Coated pit internalization from the apical ( but not the basolateral ) surface of polarized mammalian cells [ 37 , 38 ] and lamprey neuronal synapses [ 39 , 40 ] is also actin - dependent .

Thus , while actin dynamics play an evolutionarily conserved role in clathrin - dependent endocytosis , mammalian cells regulate the interplay between the clathrin and actin systems . Our analyses of VSV and coated plaque internalization reveal two properties that correlate with their actin - dependent uptake mechanisms . First , plaques and VSV - containing structures remain on the plasma membrane for . 2 - fold longer than standard coated pits [ 15 , 26 ] ( Figure 3C , E ) . The prolonged presence of a clathrin lattice might promote interactions between clathrin - associated proteins and regulators of actin polymerization . Second , clathrin plaques and VSV - containing structures physically differ from standard coated pits . Plaques fail to constrict their outer boundaries during the final phase of clathrin assembly [ 26 ] , and pits containing VSV lack a complete clathrin coat [ 15 , 17 ] . Such unusual structural features might attract proteins that associate with exposed lipids , such as dynamin . Indeed , significantly more dynamin molecules accumulate during the final stages of VSV uptake [ 15 ] . This localized increase in dynamin may enhance the recruitment of dynamin - interacting proteins with the capacity to bind lipids and activate the Arp2 / 3 complex through N - WASP , including endophilin , syndapin , and SNX9 [ 42 – 46 ] . Although these proteins may link the clathrin and actin systems and facilitate localized membrane remodeling during endocytosis ( reviewed in [ 47 ] ) , further studies are needed to determine whether they play a role in clathrin - dependent VSV endocytosis . Comparative studies of VSV and DI - T uptake may provide a useful tool to dissect the mechanisms that regulate actin assembly during clathrin - mediated endocytosis . Implications for the internalization mechanisms of other viruses The dimensions of the actin - dependent VSV particle and the actin - independent DI - T particle fall within the range of shapes present in many pleomorphic viruses . Our work suggests that this may lead to important distinctions in their mode of uptake . For example , some influenza A virus strains , such as X - 31 , produce spherical particles that measure 80 – 120 nm in diameter [ 18 ] . By contrast , the Udorn strain forms filamentous particles that measure 80 – 100 nm wide and up to 30 microns in length [ 48 , 49 ] . Although influenza A virus can enter cells by clathrin - dependent and - independent mechanisms [ 14 ] , the impact of particle shape on the entry pathway remains unknown . It seems likely that remodeling of the cortical actin cytoskeleton will be important for uptake of filamentous influenza particles , and clathrin may facilitate local membrane deformation during the endocytic process . The Arenaviridae generate roughly spherical particles that range in diameter from 40 – 300 nm [ 50 , 51 ] , and it is known that clathrin function is important for efficient infection of cells by some New World arenaviruses [ 52 ] . It will now be of interest to determine whether spherical particles of different diameter employ altered modes of clathrin - based endocytosis . Pseudotyping is often used to study the entry pathway of highly pathogenic viruses , including the long filamentous filoviruses , Ebola and Marburg , as well as several arenaviruses . Such pseudotypes are frequently based on VSV or retroviral virions in which the endogenous entry proteins have been replaced with the surface glycoproteins of the pathogenic virus [ 53 – 56 ] . Although viral pseudotypes are useful for studying the entry process , VSV and the spherical virions of retroviruses ( , 100 nm in diameter ) do not accurately recapitulate the sizes or shapes of the pleomorphic viruses . Our studies of VSV and DI - T clearly show that virion geometry can fundamentally alter aspects of the viral internaliza - tion process . Therefore , it is critically important to study viral endocytosis using pseudotyped or virus - like particles that closely approximate the physical properties of a virus in question .

BSC1 cells stably expressing rat s 2 adaptin - eGFP ( s 2 - eGFP ) [ 9 ] were maintained as above in the presence of 0 . 4 mg mL 2 1 geneticin ( G418 , Invitrogen ) . Figure 4 .

Defective interfering T ( DI - T ) particles of VSV were recovered from a cDNA clone of the DI - T genome [ 24 ] . The DI - T particles were amplified by co - infecting baby hamster kidney cells ( BHK - 21 , ATCC C - 13 ) with rVSV ( multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) 50 ) . A subsequent passage was performed by inoculating cells with filtered , undiluted supernatant from the primary amplification and rVSV ( MOI of 50 ) . Viruses were concentrated by centrifugation at 44 , 000 6 g , and the virus pellet was resuspended in NTE ( 10 mM Tris pH 7 . 4 , 100 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA ) . The two particle forms were separated on a 15 – 45 % sucrose gradient prepared in NTE by centrifugation at 77 , 000 6 g for 5 h . The DI - T particles were extracted from the upper virus band , concentrated as before , and resuspended to 1 mg mL 2 1 of total protein in PBS . Dye conjugation to virus particles Purified DI - T and VSV particles were labeled with Alexa Fluor dye molecules ( Molecular Probes , Invitrogen ) as previously described [ 15 ] except that the final dye concentration in the labeling reaction was reduced to 25 m g ml 2 1 . Plaque assays of virus preps before and after labeling showed that dye conjugation did not affect the infectivity of VSV particles or the capacity of DI - T virions to inhibit plaque formation by VSV . The surface density of G protein on VSV or DI - T particles was estimated by measuring the ratio of G protein to N protein in each particle population . To separate and visualize the viral proteins , purified virions were subjected to SDS - PAGE using 10 % polyacrylamide and 0 . 13 % bis - acrylamide and stained with Coomassie blue . The relative amounts of N or G protein were established using ImageJ ( U . S . National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , Maryland ; http : / / rsb . info . nih . gov / ij / ) .

Prior to trans - fection , media on the cells was replaced with 1 ml OPTIMEM ( Invitrogen ) . After addition of the transfection mixture , cells were incubated at 37 u C for 5 h , and the existing media was supplemented with 2 ml DMEM containing 10 % FBS . To ensure optimal replacement of endogenous clathrin light chain molecules with rat eGFP - clathrin light chain A1 ( eGFP - LCa ) [ 9 ] , cells were transfected with 0 . 75 m g of plasmid DNA encoding eGFP - LCa . The cells were cultured for , 36 h and seeded onto glass coverslips , 14 h prior to image acquisition . Co - expression of mCherry - LCa ( constructed as described for tomato - LCa [ 8 ] ) and mouse cortactin - eGFP [ 57 , 58 ] was achieved by transfection of cells on glass coverslips with 1 m g of each plasmid , and the cells were imaged , 18 h later .

Right , maximum fluorescence intensity of AP - 2 in the events at left . Data are from 4 of the 5 cells analyzed in C , as thermal drift during imaging prevented accurate fluorescence intensity measurements in one cell . The number of events in each category is shown above the corresponding plots at right . DI - T ( blue ) data consists only of productive internalization events . VSV events are categorized as productive internalizations ( VSV entry , red ) or non - productive captures ( trapped VSV , red ) . A non - productive capture is defined as a stable colocalization between a spot of AP - 2 and a VSV particle that began at least 300 s before the last captured image and did not result in virus uptake before cessation of imaging . The 300 s cutoff was chosen because a majority ( 22 / 24 ) of productive internalizations occurred within 300 s of capture . Captures in which the final image frame was acquired before 300 s elapsed were excluded from the analysis , as the eventual endocytic fate of the particle cannot be predicted . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . ppat . 1001127 . g006 Virus Length Alters Clathrin - Dependent Endocytosis PLoS Pathogens | www . plospathogens . org 9 September 2010 | Volume 6 | Issue 9 | e1001127 Live cell imaging Cells on 25 mm coverslips ( No . 1 . 5 , Electron Microscopy Sciences ; Hatfield , PA ) were placed into a perfusion chamber and overlaid with a - MEM lacking phenol red ( Invitrogen ) and supplemented with 20 mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 and 2 % FBS . The chamber was placed in a heated sample holder ( 20 / 20 Technology Inc . ; Wilmington , NC ) mounted on the stage of a Mariana imaging system ( Intelligent Imaging Innovations , Denver , CO ) based on an Axiovert 200M inverted microscope ( Carl Zeiss , Inc . ; Thornwood , NY ) . The microscope stage and objective lenses were maintained at 37 u C within an environmental chamber , and the air above the cells was supplied with 5 % CO 2 . The position of the sample holder with respect to the objective lens was manipulated using a PZ - 2000 automated stage ( Applied Scientific Instrumen - tation ; Eugene , OR ) . Samples were illuminated using 40 – 50 mW solid state lasers ( l = 488 , Coherent , Inc . ; Santa Clara , CA , l = 561 , Cobolt AB ; Solna , Sweden , l = 640 , 40 mW ; Coherent ) directed through an acousto - optic tunable filter ( AOTF ; Gooch and Housego L . L . C . ; Melbourne , FL ) . Laser illumination was imparted on the sample through a CSU - X1 spinning disk confocal unit ( Yokogawa Electric Corporation ; Tokyo , Japan ) and a 63X objective lens ( Plan - Apochromat , NA 1 . 4 , Carl Zeiss ) . Emission spectra were selected using single band width emission filters ( LF405 / 488 / 561 / 635 - A , Semrock ; Rochester , NY ) , and after transmission through a spherical aberration correction device ( Infinity Photo - Optical ; Boulder , CO ) , the emission photons were collected using a Cascade II : 512B back - illuminated EMCCD camera ( Roper Scientific , Photometrics ; Tuscon , AZ ) . Under this configuration , a single pixel corresponds to 0 . 07 6 0 . 07 m m 2 . Slidebook 4 . 2 . 13 ( Intelligent Imaging Innovations , Inc . ( III ) ; Denver , CO ) was used to command the hardware devices and visualize the acquired data . To image virus internalization , Alexa - labeled virus was centrifuged briefly to remove aggregates , and cells were inoculated with virus to result in attachment of , 50 particles per cell within 20 min . ( , 1 6 10 7 p . f . u . of VSV , , MOI 100 , 0 . 005 – 0 . 05 particles per m m 2 of cell surface area ) . Time - lapse acquisitions were typically carried out for 8 – 10 min . per cell , and images were captured at 3 – 4 s intervals after sequentially illuminating the sample with the appropriate laser for 50 – 100 ms per wavelength . To assess the effect of latrunculin B ( latB ) ( Sigma - Aldrich , Inc . ; St . Louis , MO ) on coated vesicle formation and virus entry , cells were treated with 6 . 3 m M of latB for , 10 min . at 37 u C prior to the addition of virus particles . Image analysis Image analysis was performed as previously described [ 15 ] with the following modifications . Slidebook 4 . 2 . 13 ( III ) was used to view , scale , and export images for publication . Movies were generated by exporting a series of continuous TIFF files from a Slidebook time - lapse acquisition and compiling the images into a single AVI file using ImageJ ( NIH ) . SigmaPlot 8 . 0 ( SYSTAT ; Point Richmond , CA ) was used to plot data . Microsoft Excel was used to determine whether data from 2 categories differ in a statistically significant manner using two - tailed Student’s t - tests . An automated image analysis application ( IMAB ) [ 8 ] developed within MATLAB ( Mathworks ; Natick , MA ) was used to track the formation of clathrin - coated structures and the internalization of single virus particles . Images were processed for analysis as previously described , and established criteria were used to exclude incomplete endocytic events and events in which pixels assigned to one clathrin structure merged with or split from an adjacent structure [ 8 ] . For each cell of interest , the first , 50 pits lacking virus particles were analyzed in detail to measure the coat lifetime and protein composition ( see below ) . All complete virus uptake events that occurred in these cells were also analyzed in a similar manner . With the exception of internalization events blocked by latB , incomplete internalization events or events truncated by the start / end of image acquisition were not analyzed . Aggregates of virus were identified as objects with fluorescence intensities greater than that of single particles and were excluded from all analyses . IMAB was used to measure the fluorescence intensity of coat components or virus particles in the following manner . A roughly spherical mask encompassing 69 pixels was centered on the peak fluorescence intensity of the object in all frames that the object was detectable above the local background fluorescence . The contri - bution of the local background fluorescence was estimated by measuring the average intensity of pixels within a ring of single pixel width that extended from the outer boundary of the object mask . The intensity of the pixels within the object mask was then summed , and the average intensity value of pixels in the local background was subtracted from each pixel within the object mask to estimate the fluorescence contributed by proteins ( or dye molecules ) within the object of interest . Electron microscopy Purified virus particles were deposited onto carbon - coated copper grids and stained with 2 % phosphotungstic acid ( PTA ) in H 2 O ( pH 7 . 5 ) . To visualize DI - T particles in clathrin - coated pits , BSC1 cells were inoculated with unlabeled DI - T particles using a dose that yielded , 1000 attached particles per cell after 10 min . Samples were then processed for ultra - thin sectioning as previously described [ 15 , 59 ] . Electron micrographs of VSV particles in clathrin endocytic structures were obtained from cells infected with VSV for 6 h , where the entry of newly released particles could readily be visualized . Virus particles and ultra - thin sections of cells were viewed using a Tecnai G 2 Spirit BioTWIN transmission electron microscope ( FEI , Hillsboro , OR ) . Figure 7 . Model of DI - T and VSV entry . DI - T ( above ) and VSV ( below ) particles engage host cells through interactions between the viral surface glycoproteins and unknown cellular receptor moieties . Following attachment , both particle types undergo slow diffusion ( diffusion coefficient , 5 6 10 2 11 cm 2 s 2 1 ) on the cell surface for an average of , 2 min . before being captured by a clathrin - coated pit . For DI - T , continued clathrin assembly drives complete particle envelopment by the plasma membrane and leads to virus endocytosis . In contrast , the presence of a VSV particle in a coated pit physically prevents complete membrane constriction by the clathrin machinery and causes clathrin assembly to halt prematurely . The force provided by actin polymerization then further remodels the plasma membrane and thereby encloses the virus particle in a partially clathrin - coated vesicle . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . ppat . 1001127 . g007 Virus Length Alters Clathrin - Dependent Endocytosis PLoS Pathogens | www . plospathogens . org 10 September 2010 | Volume 6 | Issue 9 | e1001127 Supporting Information Video S1 Clathrin - dependent DI - T internalization .

A clathrin - coated pit captures the virus particle when a dim adaptor spot colocalizes with the virus signal . The adaptor fluorescence intensity increases as coated pit assembly proceeds , and particle internalization occurs shortly after the adaptor signal peaks . Disappearance of the adaptor signal signifies clathrin uncoating , and the virus - containing vesicle is then transported toward the cell interior .
