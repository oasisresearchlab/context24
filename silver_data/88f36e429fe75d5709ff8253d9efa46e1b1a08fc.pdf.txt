Crystal structures have shown the tandem CH domains of  - actinin to be in a compact , closed conformation , but the interpretations of complexes of such tandem CH domains with F - actin have been ambiguous . We show that the tandem CH domains of  - actinin bind F - actin in an open conformation , explaining mutations that cause human diseases and suggesting that the opening of these domains may be one of the main regulatory mechanisms for proteins with tandem CH domains . Many actin - binding proteins have a modular architecture , and the calponin homology ( CH ) domain is found in some actin - binding proteins in one , two or four copies . But the manner in which these domains interact with F - actin has been controversial 1 , 2 . α - actinin is an actin - filament cross - linking protein that was originally found in skeletal muscle . It is now known that α - actinin has a crucial role in many cell types in forming the actin cytoskeleton and is involved in cell - cell and cell - matrix interactions , lamelli - podia and stress fibers , among other cellular sites . As expected , mutations in α - actinin have been linked to a number of human diseases 3 . The actin - binding domain ( ABD ) of α - actinin contains two CH domains . Multiple crystal struc - tures 4 , 5 have shown these CH domains to be in a compact , closed conformation ( where there is a substantial interface between the two domains ) . Crystal structures of tandem CH domains from other proteins such as utrophin 6 , dystrophin 7 and filamin 8 have shown the same conformation , although in some of these crystals the compact conformation is maintained by domain swapping of CH1 and CH2 between two different extended molecules . Solution studies 4 have shown that the CH domains of α - actinin adopt a closed conformation independently of crystal packing . An electron microscopy study at 20 - Å resolution of two - dimensional crystals of α - actinin revealed that both closed and open ( where the two CH domains are substantially separated ) tandem CH domains were present 9 . In complexes of tandem CH domains with F - actin , however , most electron microscopy reconstructions have suffered from limited resolution , and there has been a debate as to whether the density bound to actin arises from CH domains in an open or closed conformation 1 , 2 , 5 . A three - dimensional reconstruction of the α - actinin tandem CH domains bound to F - actin was made 10 before atomic structures were available for any CH domain . That low - resolution reconstruction has been subsequently interpreted as showing that the two CH domains are in a compact or closed conformation 1 , 5 . We have used both electron microscopy of negatively stained samples and cryo – electron microscopy of unstained , frozen - hydrated samples ( see Supplementary Methods ) to examine complexes of the α - actinin ABD with F - actin ( Fig . 1 ) . Because previous controversies involv - ing CH domains bound to F - actin have used either cryo – electron microscopy or negative stain , it is important to understand whether the different specimen - preparation methods and imaging techniques can account for any of the differences . Reconstructions generated with the iterative helical real - space reconstruction method from negatively stained specimens ( Fig . 1e ) and frozen - hydrated specimens ( Fig . 1f ) , when filtered to the limit - ing resolution in negative stain ( ~ 23 Å ) , are similar , and they show a single mass of additional density bound to each subunit in the actin filament ( arrows , Fig . 1e , f ) . These reconstructions are similar to a pre - vious reconstruction 10 of F - actin decorated with the α - actinin ABD , and full decoration is seen without the need for any additional sorting 1 Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics , University of Virginia Medical Center , Charlottesville , Virginia , USA . 2 Department for Structural and Computational Biology , Max F .

This contrasts with the binding of fimbrin’s ABD1 ( containing CH1 and CH2 ) to F - actin , where very weak decoration was seen 11 , 12 , or the binding of utrophin’s ABD to F - actin , where both weak and polymorphic binding was seen 2 . Even with full decoration , at this limited resolution , ambiguities exist in the interpretation of such a volume . We have therefore used the cryo – electron microscopy reconstruction at a resolution of 16 Å ( Fig . 2a ) for model building . At this resolution , we found that the actin subunits must actually have a more closed nucleotide - binding cleft than in the more than 20 existing crystal structures of G - actin . When the thres - hold of the surface is chosen to enclose an atomic model of actin , the additional mass bound to F - actin can only accommodate a single CH domain . Lowering the threshold ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) shows some density at higher radius but is inconsistent with closed tandem CH domains bound to actin . Given the separation by ~ 25 Å of CH domains within the same molecule in the crystal of the utrophin ABD 6 , a second CH domain in the open state that is not bound to F - actin could be at a considerable radius from F - actin and thus not be seen after helical averaging . For comparison , when the volume 12 of F - actin decorated with fimbrin’s ABD2 ( CH3 - CH4 ) is filtered to the same 16 - Å resolution and thresholded to enclose actin ( Fig . 2b ) , the surface encloses two CH domains . A potential ambiguity exists at this resolution as to whether the additional mass is due to CH1 or CH2 from α - actinin , given the high level of structural similarity between these domains . Because it has been shown 13 that the main binding site within α - actinin for actin is contained within CH1 , we think it reasonable to fit CH1 into this vol - ume . At the available resolution , there is no ambiguity in docking CH1 to actin , either manually or with automated procedures , with respect to any translational or rotational degrees of freedom . Our new model of α - actinin CH1 bound to F - actin is very similar to the model of fimbrin CH3 bound to F - actin ( Fig . 2c ) , indicating that some features of this interactions are conserved . Using CH1 for alignment , superimposition of the compact α - actinin CH1 - CH2 crystal structure on CH1 bound to F - actin ( Fig . 3a ) results in a steric clash of CH2 with actin . Thus , the two domains of this closed CH1 - CH2 ABD must either rearrange or separate to allow binding . In the case of fimbrin’s ABD2 , the two domains undergo a small rearrangement with respect to each other compared to crystal structures , as steric clashes between CH4 and actin would result in the absence of such rearrangments 12 . In a crystal of fimbrin’s actin - binding core ( containing two tandem CH domains , CH1 - CH2 and CH3 - CH4 ; PDB 1PXY ) , a substantial difference in the CH1 - CH2 interface was seen between two molecules in the asymmetric unit , whereas the CH3 - CH4 interface was structurally very similar between the two molecules . This new interpretation can be applied to previous results with α - actinin . A mutation ( K255E ) of a residue located at the inter - face between CH1 and CH2 in α - actinin ( Fig . 3a ) has been shown to be respon - sible for an inherited late - onset kidney failure . In vitro , this mutant protein has a six - fold higher affinity for actin filaments ( K d = 5 µ M ) than the wild - type protein ( K d = 32 µ M ) . It was suggested 14 that the mutation destabilizes the CH1 - CH2 inter - face and exposes an additional actin - binding surface ( ABS1 ) on CH1 that is buried in the closed CH1 - CH2 ABD . This proposal for ABS1 arose from peptide studies 15 on dystrophin binding to actin , but such a binding site was not seen in a subsequent study using larger protein fragments from dystrophin 16 . Our results ( Fig . 3a ) suggest that no new actin - binding surface is exposed ; rather , the presence of CH2 provides steric hindrance to binding F - actin , and opening of the a b c CH4 CH3 CH1 Figure 2 Pseudoatomic models .

Residues 133 – 147 are shown in blue , as the corresponding residues in smooth - muscle α - actinin were shown to be making the dominant contact with actin 13 . ( c ) A superposition of the models for the binding to F - actin of α - actinin’s CH1 and fimbrin’s CH3 - CH4 shows that the interaction between CH1 and actin is very similar to the interaction between CH3 and actin . a b CH1 CH2 CH1 CH2 Figure 3 Steric clash between CH2 of α - actinin and actin . ( a ) The crystal structure of the ABD of α - actinin ( PDB 1TJT ) has been docked onto F - actin so that CH1 is superimposed on the model for CH1 bound to F - actin in Figure 2a . CH2 has a significant penetration into the actin volume , indicated by the black arrows . The position of residue 255 at the CH1 - CH2 interface is indicated by the magenta space - filling atoms . The K255E mutation destabilizes this interface and increases the affinity of α - actinin for actin 14 . ( b ) The binding of α - actinin’s ABD to F - actin is likely to explain observations made about plectin 19 , another actin - binding protein containing tandem CH domains . When CH1 of plectin ( PDB 1MB8 ) is aligned with CH1 of α - actinin , CH2 of plectin makes a steric clash with an actin protomer ( black arrow ) . When the two plectin CH domains can separate , the affinity for F - actin is approximately three times greater than when the two CH domains are cross - linked ( the disulfide cross - link is indicated by the space filling atoms at the CH1 - CH2 interface ) in a closed conformation 19 , suggesting that the strain introduced into either F - actin or plectin to eliminate the steric clash reduces the binding affinity . © 2010 N a t u r e A m e r i ca , I n c . A ll r i gh t s r ese r ve d . 616 VOLUME 17 NUMBER 5 MAY 2010 NATURE STRUCTURAl & MOlECUlAR BIOlOgy CH1 - CH2 interface is required for normal binding . Thus , destabiliza - tion of the CH1 - CH2 interface enhances binding F - actin . Strikingly , all of the α – actinin - 4 mutations causing focal segmental glomeru - losclerosis in humans map to residues at the CH1 - CH2 interface 14 , and most of these have been shown to result in an increased affinity for binding F - actin . The increased affinity undermines normal func - tion , most likely by preventing the rapid exchange of α - actinin during cytoskeletal remodeling . The notion that CH2 is a negative regulator in the binding of tandem CH domains to F - actin is consistent with the fact that , whereas isolated CH1 domains bind F - actin , isolated CH2 domains show no affinity for binding F - actin 17 . The ability of the two CH domains in α - actinin to open is supported by direct observations of a two - dimensional crystal of α - actinin dimers in which one molecule in each dimer exists with the CH domains in a closed conformation , whereas the other molecule has the CH domains in an open confor - mation 9 . It should be noted , however , that CH1 alone of α - actinin has been observed to bind F - actin with lower affinity than that of a CH1 - CH2 fragment 17 . CH2 may thus also serve as a positive regulator of binding of CH1 to F - actin , and a regulatory role for CH2 has pre - viously been suggested based in part upon the fact that PIP2 , a lipid that has been shown to regulate the bundling of F - actin by α - actinin , binds CH2 ( ref . 18 ) . Our results suggest a reinterpretation of some previous observa - tions with other actin - binding proteins . It was shown for plectin , which also contains tandem CH domains , that a disulfide cross - link that keeps CH1 and CH2 in a closed conformation still allows bind - ing to F - actin but reduces the affinity of such binding by a factor of about 3 ( ref . 19 ) ( from K d = 23 µ M in the absence of the cross - link to K d = 59 µ M in the presence of the cross - link ) . When the closed CH1 - CH2 crystal structure of plectin is superimposed on the model of α - actinin CH1 bound to F - actin ( Fig . 3b ) , it can be seen that CH2 of plectin is making a steric clash with an actin subunit . We sug - gest that the opening of the two CH domains in plectin is required to eliminate this steric clash , and that the reduction in affinity for binding when the two domains are cross - linked is due to the strain imposed upon either the plectin ABD or F - actin . This contrasts with the interpretation that the opening of the two domains is required to reveal an actin - binding interface that is otherwise buried between the two CH domains 19 . Similarly , a mutation in human dystrophin ( Y231N ) that is found in Becker muscular dystrophy patients is buried 7 at the interface of CH1 and CH2 . In filamin , missense mutations within CH1 lead to a loss - of - function phenotype , whereas mutations within CH2 lead to increased affinity for actin and skeletal disorders 8 . One filamin mutation , S235P , that leads to boomerang dysplasia is found at the CH1 - CH2 interface . Two other filamin mutations that are buried in CH2 ( where they could not interact with actin ) but near the CH1 - CH2 interface result in decreased thermostability and increased crystallographic temperature factors 8 , with increased affin - ity for F - actin ( a shift of the K d from 7 µ M for the wild type to either 2 µ M or 0 . 6 µ M for the mutants ) , completely consistent with our model that CH2 is a negative regulator whose destabilization would lead to increased binding to actin . It is clear that , although the structural homology among all CH domains is great , the conserved structure does not dictate conserved interactions with F - actin . The CH domain within the eponymous protein calponin has been shown 20 to never bind F - actin , just as CH2 of α - actinin does not interact with F - actin , as shown previously 13 and in this report . When both CH domains in a protein with tandem CH domains do interact with F - actin , as in ABD2 of fimbrin 12 , the inter - action between CH4 and actin is very different from the interaction of CH3 with actin . Structural homology only really establishes that two proteins share common ancestry , and not that they have conserved interactions or functions . The CH domains found in many actin - binding proteins have thus evolved to have different functions , and the CH2 domains in proteins such as α - actinin , plectin and filamin appear to be negative regulatory elements .
