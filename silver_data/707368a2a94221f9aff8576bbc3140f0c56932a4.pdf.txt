CASE STUDY To manage a large and heterogenous population of patients with confirmed or presumed Covid - 19 , but well enough to remain at home , the University of Pennsylvania Health System ( UPHS ) developed a program to monitor for worsening dyspnea or other concerning symptoms . “COVID Watch” combined automated twice - daily text message check - ins with a dedicated team of telemedicine clinicians who could respond 24 / 7 to escalations in patient need . We report our experience with the first 3 , 000 invited patients . Approximately 83 % of patients were managed by the automated program without escalating to human care . KEY TAKEAWAYS » An automated text - messaging system was effective in remotely monitoring patients with confirmed or suspected Covid - 19 and rapidly connecting them by phone with human care 24 / 7 when needed . We call this approach “automated hovering . ” » Automated systems for patient care are likely to be more effective , and have more use cases , if paired with human care in the form of escalation or exception management .

Both groups might benefit from regular check - ins . In early March 2020 , as the U . S . began to take seriously the threat of this disease , and as the clinical progression of the virus was still being understood , our team developed a strategy for watching over patients with confirmed or presumed Covid - 19 at home . The Goal We sought to solve several goals simultaneously : 1 . Support a heterogeneous population of patients infected with Covid - 19 who were remaining at home . 2 . Identify and expedite the care of infected patients whose conditions were worsening . 3 . Reduce health care personnel burden at a time when clinicians were being diverted to other tasks . The Execution Overview We developed a Short Message Service ( SMS ) - based automated remote monitoring program , called “COVID Watch , ” for Penn Medicine patients with presumed or confirmed Covid - 19 infection . The texting program , which triggers calls from telemedicine clinicians when needed , was designed to supplement existing lines of care . We call our approach “automated hovering . ”2 The texting program , which triggers calls from telemedicine clinicians when needed , was designed to supplement existing lines of care . We call our approach “automated hovering . ” " “ NEJM CATALYST INNOVATIONS IN CARE DELIVERY 3 Figure 1 depicts the program’s overall patient flow . Patients with presumed or confirmed Covid - 19 are invited to enroll in COVID Watch . The program sends each patient automated twice - daily text messages to assess their health status . Based largely on dyspnea ( shortness of breath ) , patients may be automatically escalated to a team of registered nurses available 24 / 7 . Patients can also text “worse” at any time and be immediately escalated to a nurse , or end their participation by texting “bye . ” Nurses call escalating patients within one hour to assess and address their needs , and may refer them to the ED or an on - call team of physicians and advanced practice providers for additional telemedicine assessments . The program continues for 14 days from enrollment , at which point patients may opt for an additional seven days , after which they “graduate . ” Graduating patients are asked if they would recommend the program to others . FIGURE 1 NEJM CATALYST INNOVATIONS IN CARE DELIVERY 4 Enrollment mechanics Patients are enrolled by a clinician entering the patient’s cell phone number in the COVID Watch order embedded within our Epic electronic health record ( EHR ) . Enrollment can take place at different times , including after a patient tests positive ( by physicians staffing our results reporting system ) , during an ED visit , a call or telehealth visit with any UPHS clinician , or following discharge from an inpatient admission for Covid - 19 . We included patients with symptoms suggestive of Covid - 19 , such as cough and shortness of breath , because at the program’s onset testing was limited , results were often delayed a week , and we felt the constellation of concordant symptoms was sufficient indication . Enrolled patients received a text message inviting their participation and could accept or decline . Those declining were dropped . Those not responding were sent a reminder in the evening and were dropped after 48 hours of no response . Texts were sent in English at the start , and a Spanish version was added later . Clinical escalations Figure 2 shows a sample SMS exchange . Patients who reported dyspnea in response to the twice - daily check - ins , or who texted “worse” at any time , triggered an EHR inbox message into a pool monitored 24 / 7 by registered nurses dedicated to COVID Watch . Nurses were expected to call patients within one hour . NEJM CATALYST INNOVATIONS IN CARE DELIVERY 5 FIGURE 2 Nurses were guided by a clinical algorithm that we developed to identify patients as ( a ) “emergent” and referred to the ED ( e . g . , patient cannot complete sentences ) , ( b ) “urgent” and referred to a 24 / 7 on - call team of physicians and advanced practice providers for a telemedicine appointment within 2 - 12 hours ( e . g . , breathing harder or faster than usual ) , or ( c ) “routine” and given immediate advice and asked to self - monitor or follow up with a PCP . Physicians supervised the clinical program 24 hours a day . NEJM CATALYST INNOVATIONS IN CARE DELIVERY 6 Oversight and rapid cycle innovation The COVID Watch team met seven days a week for the first eight weeks of the program , ramping down to three days a week . We built a comprehensive web - based dashboard , taking feeds from our EHR and the regional health information exchange , a database for sharing patient information on ED visits , admissions , and discharges . The dashboard enabled immediate review of every patient escalation and monitored patients enrolled in COVID Watch who visited any regional ED . Patients who were sent to the ED but not admitted helped reveal how the automated program might be too sensitive . Patients who visited the ED without the program and were admitted revealed how it might not be sensitive enough . We paid careful attention to the latter patients , even though we saw those catches as successes , too ; COVID Watch was never meant to be the only way patients could find their way to an ED but as a supplement to conventional approaches . Given delays in ascertaining out - of - hospital deaths , we could not identify false negatives — those patients monitored by the program who failed to escalate in our system and died at home . Refining the algorithm We also conducted telephone interviews with patients who declined the program or dropped out before 14 days . These interviews , and our analysis of clinical escalations , helped us refine the algorithm , messaging , and clinical protocols . One such change broadened the focus on dyspnea to include fever , fatigue , nausea / vomiting , or chest pain . This alteration immediately resulted in a nearly 10 - fold increase in escalation call volume , but did not result in any more patients referred to the emergency department . As a result , we reverted back to our dyspnea - focused algorithm after one day and excluded those escalations from the outcomes reported below . The Institutional Review Board at the University of Pennsylvania reviewed the program and deemed it Quality Improvement . Hurdles Application - or web - based Covid - 19 screening tools appeared early in the pandemic , relying first on travel history and later on symptoms alone . These programs recommended that high - risk individuals contact a doctor . An early hurdle was recognizing that we were trying to solve a few different problems . First , distinguishing who was infected and who was not was less important than distinguishing who was infected and needed hospitalization , and everyone else . Second , we did not want seriously ill patients to arrange their own care but wanted to connect them to care immediately . Third , as knowledge about Covid - 19’s course was evolving , we needed short - cycle quality assurance to oversee and modify the decisions of the algorithm and the clinical support that followed . Our Center for Health Care Innovation ( CHCI ) conceived and led COVID Watch . Our first meeting to develop the program was on March 11 , 2020 ; our first patient was invited on March 23 ; and by April 27 we had invited 3 , 000 patients . We were able to quickly build on Penn Medicine’s previous investments in platforms and foundational experiences necessary for rapid innovation , including : NEJM CATALYST INNOVATIONS IN CARE DELIVERY 7 [ 1 ] Way to Health3 , 4 ( W2H ) is an automated platform created in 2010 with NIH funding to facilitate clinical trials of patient - engagement strategies and to become the platform for those strategies if successful . Way to Health combines messaging capabilities ( SMS , e - mail , robocall ) and other relevant automated features , such as electronic patient consent and secure data collection . Since its creation , W2H has been the foundation of over 170 clinical trials serving over 85 , 000 patients . It had already been integrated into our Epic EHR , so that individual clinicians could order W2H programs for their patients directly from the medical record . [ 2 ] Penn Medicine had developed OnDemand , 5 a telemedicine program designed originally to serve the urgent care needs of Penn Medicine employees , and then rapidly scaled to support the general patient community during the Covid - 19 pandemic . This program provided the initial clinical infrastructure and experience for the team to feel comfortable offering automated engagement with infected patients at home . [ 3 ] The innovation center had also developed Agent , 6 a platform that merges data from our EHR and other digital sources . Agent applies data analysis and provides visualizations to support the monitoring of patient populations without needing to check individual patient records . Agent facilitated our ability to oversee this new program in real time . Team The team comprised members from the Center for Health Care Innovation and the three programs listed above , and eventually included its own medical director , a nursing director , the clinical nurses ( approximately seven FTE at peak ) , and several medical students . Metrics Enrollment and satisfaction Table 1 reports the first 3 , 000 patients invited into COVID Watch , from March 23 to April 27 , 2020 . During that period , 2 , 652 patients ( 88 . 4 % ) were tested for Covid - 19 , of whom 1907 ( 72 % ) tested positive . Approximately 78 % of invited patients accepted and remained in the program for a mean of 12 . 7 days ( SD 5 . 7 ) . Patient acceptance rates and mean days in the program were largely similar across gender , race , and age . Approximately half of participating patients asked to extend their engagement from 14 days to 21 . COVID Watch received a net promoter score of 80 from the ratings of 554 patients ( 24 % of those participating ) , substantially exceeding the means in measured industries . 7 , 8 Escalations Each day , 59 . 7 % of participating patients responded to both check - ins ; 27 . 5 % to either the morning or afternoon check - in ; and 12 . 8 % responded to neither . During the observation period , 396 patients ( 17 % ) escalated to needing clinical care 537 times and 1 , 952 ( 83 % ) never escalated . On any given day , approximately 2 % of patients escalated to a nurse . Peak simultaneous participation was around 1 , 000 patients . At peak , COVID Watch generated approximately 20 escalations daily , largely NEJM CATALYST INNOVATIONS IN CARE DELIVERY 8 concentrated but well - distributed during typical waking hours , so all patients were easily assessed by the nurses on call . During the observation period , 396 patients ( 17 % ) escalated to needing clinical care 537 times and 1 , 952 ( 83 % ) never escalated . " Clinical responses Each escalation was followed by a telephone call back from a nurse ; 33 patients ( 6 % ) could not be reached . The mean and median response times were 16 and 9 minutes . Table 2 reports the clinical disposition of those responses : 83 patients ( 15 . 5 % ) prompted a recommendation to go to the ED and another 26 ( 5 % ) were already in the ED or admitted when the nurse responded . Emergency Department visit records could be found for 90 patients who had escalated within 12 hours of their ED visit , and of these 38 ( 42 % ) were admitted . Table 1 .

These patients had approximately the same rate of inpatient admission ( 39 % - 43 % ) as those who escalated through the program ( 42 % ) . As with an intention - to - treat analysis , we also followed patients who were enrolled in COVID Watch but declined or dropped out early from the program . These patients generated 58 ED visits ; 52 % of them were admitted . Table 3 illustrates these ED outcomes . Limitations A SMS - based program in English and Spanish can’t support patients who don’t use text messages or don’t speak those languages . Both of those problems are surmountable with more language options and the use of other digital communication tools , such as interactive voice recording . The latter is available through the Way to Health platform . The pressing need to quickly stand up a program for as many patients as possible , and to refine its design based on early experience , limited our ability to create a comparable control group . Nevertheless , robust existing data systems allowed us to evaluate the program’s outcomes in real time . Table 2 .

The work required is determined more by the spread of the virus than by the organizational structure . " Funding The automated component of COVID Watch used existing health system resources , including Way to Health and Agent . The follow - up call component was staffed by physicians and nurses whose normal clinical activities were displaced by the pandemic . As clinical staff return to their usual roles , we have faced the question of how to support continued operations . An initiative that uses centralized resources can seem like an additional cost to a system , but that is an accounting fiction : The system would need to care for these patients one way or another . The work required is determined more by the spread of the virus than by the organizational structure . We expect to continue centralized support for COVID Watch and related programs , like our Covid - 19 results - reporting system , because they provide economic efficiency and quality control . Conclusion COVID Watch combines automated SMS - based monitoring of patients with a 24 / 7 clinical back end . The program was designed to remotely observe patients with suspected or confirmed Covid - 19 and to rapidly escalate to human care when needed . Our experience with the first 3 , 000 invited patients demonstrates efficiency and patient satisfaction . This is based on several factors , including automated check - ins that enabled seven FTE nurses to manage 1 , 000 sick patients 24 / 7 at the program’s peak , and a high net promoter score . As of June 21 , 2020 , COVID Watch has managed 4 , 249 COVID - 19 patients at home . We also launched several companion programs , designed for overlapping purposes : • Pregnancy Watch enrolled pregnant patients with Covid - 19 and followed an essentially identical protocol , except that it escalated to experts in maternal fetal medicine . As of June 21 , 2020 , it had enrolled 138 patients . • COVID Pulse was designed partly in response to reports that some patients with Covid - 19 have little dyspnea , despite concerning hypoxemia ( low blood oxygen ) . 9 This program enrolls patients from emergency departments with depressed oxygen saturations , providing them with pulse oximeters , and escalates to care based on declines in measured oxygen saturation . As of June 21 , 2020 , it had enrolled 56 patients . “ NEJM CATALYST INNOVATIONS IN CARE DELIVERY 11 While we hope there will be no long - term need for COVID Watch , we believe that its broad uptake and support sets an example for future automated programs that facilitate patient care and communication while increasing efficiency . " While we hope there will be no long - term need for COVID Watch , we believe that its broad uptake and support sets an example for future automated programs that facilitate patient care and communication while increasing efficiency . We have a similar program running for patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease that also combines SMS - based monitoring with human back - up support , and we are in various stages of conceiving , developing , or evaluating programs for other conditions , including hypertension , congestive heart failure , and cirrhosis .
