Summary Candida albicans is a diploid fungal pathogen lacking a deﬁned complete sexual cycle , and thus has been refractory to standard forward genetic analysis . Instead , transcription proﬁling and reverse genetic strategies based on Saccharomyces cerevisiae have typically been used to link genes to functions . To overcome restrictions inherent in such indirect approaches , we have investigated a forward genetic mutagenesis strategy based on the UAU1 technology . We screened 4700 random insertion mutants for defects in hyphal development and linked two new genes ( ARP2 and VPS52 ) to hyphal growth . Deleting ARP2 abolished hyphal formation , generated round and swollen yeast phase cells , disrupted cortical actin patches and blocked virulence in mice . The mutants also showed a global lack of induction of hyphae - speciﬁc genes upon the yeast - to - hyphae switch . Surprisingly , both arp2 D / D and arp2 D / D arp3 D / D mutants were still able to endocytose FM4 - 64 and Lucifer Yellow , although as shown by time - lapse movies internalization of FM4 - 64 was somewhat delayed in mutant cells . Thus the non - essential role of the Arp2 / 3 complex discovered by forward genetic screening in C . albicans showed that uptake of mem - brane components from the plasma membrane to vacuolar structures is not dependent on this actin nucleating machinery . Introduction Candida albicans is among the leading causes of hospital - acquired mycosis with an estimated mortality rate of 38 – 49 % ( Pfaller and Diekema , 2007 ; Koh et al . , 2008 ; Leroy et al . , 2009 ) . Although found as a normal commen - sal in the gastrointestinal tracts and mouths of 70 % of the healthy human population , C . albicans can become life - threatening to the increasing population of immunocom - promized individuals that result from conditions such as HIV infections and organ transplatation and from patients undergoing broad - spectrum - antibiotic or chemotherapy treatments ( Ruhnke and Maschmeyer , 2002 ; Pfaller and Diekema , 2007 ) . Identifying new genes involved in the virulence of this fungus remains a challenge , especially because genetic manipulation and functional character - ization studies in C . albicans have been limited because of its diploidy , the absence of a true sexual cycle and the pathogen’s use of a non - canonical genetic code that translates CUG into a serine instead of a leucine ( Kurtz et al . , 1988 ) . The well - studied yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has frequently been used as a model to identify functions in C . albicans . For instance , our understanding of morphogen - esis , signal transduction , mating and drug resistance in S . cerevisiae has led to successful gene discovery and sub - sequently to functional analysis in the fungal pathogen ( Berman and Sudbery , 2002 ; Casamayor and Snyder , 2002 ; Schwartz and Madhani , 2004 ; Bennett and Johnson , 2005 ; Berman , 2006 ; Whiteway and Bachewich , 2007 ; Cowen , 2008 ) . There are , however , evident limita - tions to using yeast to deﬁne C . albicans processes . For example , clear homologues of many S . cerevisiae pro - teins have not been identiﬁed in C . albicans ( Weig et al . , 2004 ; Bennett and Johnson , 2005 ; Braun et al . , 2005 ) . In other cases a homologue of a S . cerevisiae gene was identiﬁed in C . albicans , but no functional conservation could be observed ( Nicholls et al . , 2004 ; Santos et al . , 2004 ) .

One such example is hyphal morphogenesis in C . albicans . Although for many years researchers have relied on principles of bud emergence in S . cerevisiae in an attempt to understand hyphal formation of ﬁlamentous fungi such as C . albicans , several features of hyphal growth cannot be explained by extrapolating ﬁndings from the model yeast ( Harris and Momany , 2004 ) . Overall , this reversible yeast - to - hyphal switch has been intensively studied in the polymorphic fungus ( Liu , 2001 ; Whiteway and Bachewich , 2007 ) . Well - known environmental signals that trigger the morphological transition involve high tem - perature ( 37°C ) , serum , neutral pH , starvation , CO 2 , adherence and N - acetylglucosamine ( GlcNAc ) ( Gow , 1997 ; Sudbery et al . , 2004 ) . Multiple pathways , for instance the cAMP protein kinase , MAP kinase or the pH - responsive pathways then transmit these signals to activate expression of hyphal - speciﬁc genes ( Biswas et al . , 2007 ) . The importance of the yeast - to - hyphae tran - sition in C . albicans is highlighted by its implication in virulence ; C . albicans mutants unable to switch between a yeast and hyphal growth mode are greatly reduced in virulence in mouse infection models ( Lo et al . , 1997 ; Laprade et al . , 2002 ; Kumamoto and Vinces , 2005 ) . It has been proposed that while the yeast form contributes to the dissemination of an infection in the host , the hyphal form facilitates penetrating tissue surfaces and escaping host cell internalization ( Gow et al . , 2002 ; Whiteway and Ober - holzer , 2004 ) . With the goal of identifying new genes involved in the yeast - to - hyphae transition in C . albicans , we have used an unbiased approach for randomly generating homozy - gous null mutants directly in the pathogen . Screening 4700 random transposon insertion mutants identiﬁed two new genes , ARP2 and VPS52 , which are both required for hyphal formation . Surprisingly , in contrast to many other organisms , the highly conserved Arp2 / 3 complex was not essential for viability or endocytosis in C . albicans , while structural differences in actin organization support the importance of a functional cytoskeletal architecture in per - mitting morphological switching . These ﬁndings underline the potential for forward genetics in the pathogen itself to link functions to genes . Results Strategy for an in vivo random forward mutagenesis screen in C . albicans The UAU1 marker cassette ( Enloe et al . , 2000 ) allows the selection of homozygosed mutants in the diploid organism C . albicans . This insertional mutagenesis strategy employs a single transformation in an arg4 / arg4 , ura3 / ura3 double auxotrophic background selecting initially for Arg + / Ura - colonies ( genotype orf : : UAU1 / ORF ) , then allow - ing mitotic recombination to homozygose the insertion ( genotype orf : : UAU1 / orf : : UAU1 ) , and following this with a second round of selection yielding Arg + / Ura + segregants ( genotype orf : : UAU1 / orf : : URA3 ) that potentially carry a homozygous disruption at the site of the initial insertion . Mitchell et al . ( Davis et al . , 2002 ) have used this UAU1 marker cassette to randomly mutagenize in vitro the genome of C . albicans . This in vitro random mutagenesis resulted in a pool of plasmids each carrying the UAU1 marker cassette ﬂanked by a speciﬁc C . albicans genomic DNA sequence . We used the entire pool , rather than a chosen set of characterized UAU1 plasmids , to randomly mutagenize the genome of C . albicans in vivo , and then screened the potentially homozygous orf : : UAU1 / orf : : URA3 inserts for a phenotype of interest . To assess whether it is possible to extract a desired phenotype by using the entire UAU1 plasmid pool , we created a preliminary set of 300 orf : : UAU1 / orf : : URA3 random insertion mutants and screened for speciﬁc aux - otrophic mutants . We found one mutant that was unable to grow on SD - Trp media ( Fig . 1A ) . To map this mutation we performed inverse PCR ( Ochman et al . , 1988 ) and found the transposon insertion in TRP1 ( ORF19 . 6096 ) , the phosphoribosylanthranilate isomerase gene . TRP1 is an essential enzyme for tryptophan biosynthesis , and mutating this gene results in tryptophan auxotrophy ( Ostrander and Gorman , 1994 ) . In an attempt to link genes to more challenging and less conserved phenotypes between fungal species , such as carbon source utilization ( Martchenko et al . , 2007a , b ; Askew et al . , 2009 ) , we expanded the number of orf : : UAU1 / ORF insertions to about 5000 . From these we obtained about 4700 ( 94 % ) that generated Arg + Ura + seg - regants that represent potential orf : : UAU1 / orf : : URA3 derivatives . Among them we found one insertion mutant ( Tn - orf19 . 875 ) that cannot grow on glycerol ( Fig . 1B ) . A deletion mutant and revertant strain conﬁrmed the link between growth defects on glycerol and this uncharacter - ized C . albicans gene that has no obvious homologues in budding and ﬁssion yeast ( Arnaud et al . , 2007 ) . Thus , this preliminary screen for auxotrophs and mutants that can not grow on media containing glycerol as the sole carbon source showed that it is possible to directly link functions to a gene by using the whole pool of UAU1 plasmids . Screening for random mutants involved in hyphal formation In order to link genes to a phenotype that is absent S . cerevisiae , we phenotypically analysed the 4700 candi - date homozygotes for hyphae formation defects . No con - Arp2 / 3mutantsinC . albicans 1183 © 2010 Crown in the right of Canada , Molecular Microbiology , 75 , 1182 – 1198 vincingly hyper - ﬁlamentous colonies were identiﬁed . By contrast , we isolated a total of 20 mutants with a strong and consistent hypo - ﬁlamentous phenotype and con - ﬁrmed these phenotypes by retesting a single colony from each mutant . Mapping the 20 hits by inverse PCR showed that 11 insertions were directly in an ORF , while one insertion was mapped in the promoter of ORF19 . 860 . In the remaining eight events we either could not map the insertion because of repeated sequences ( six events ) or they fell in an intergenic region ( two events ) . Mutants that had a transposon insertion in an intergenic region were excluded from further analysis as it was unclear if the observed phenotype was linked to one of the genes adja - cent to the transposon insertion . Figures 1C and S1 sum - marize hypo - ﬁlamentation phenotypes of the 11 ORF and one promoter insertion mutant hits as determined by plate assays . To distinguish between hypo - ﬁlamentation and non - ﬁlamenting phenotypes , we analysed the 11 ORF and one promoter hypo - ﬁlamentation insertion mutants under liquid hyphal inducing conditions [ Yeast extract , peptone , dextrose ( YPD ) media + 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) at 37°C for 3 h ] and found that insertions in CDC39 , VPS52 and ARP2 failed to form true hyphae in liquid . VPS52 and ARP2 deletion mutants do not form hyphae CDC39 was previously linked to a hypo - ﬁlamentation phe - notype ( Uhl et al . , 2003 ) , while ARP2 and VPS52 were newly identiﬁed mutants that could not form hyphae under liquid - inducing conditions . We validated these latter two transposon insertion hits by both verifying the absence of the WT band in each transposon mutant and constructing deletion mutants ( Fig . S2 ) . To conﬁrm that ARP2 and VPS52 mutants are unable to form true hyphae , we re - analysed polarized morphogenesis under hyphal inducing conditions in liquid culture ( Fig . 2 ) . Tn : : arp2 ( the transposon mutant for ARP2 ) , arp2 D / D ( the deletion mutant for ARP2 ) , Tn : : vps52 and vps52 D / D did not form true hyphae , while BWP17 ( WT strain for all transposon mutants ) and SN95 ( WT strain for all deletion mutants ) , both heterozygous mutants ( arp2 / ARP2 , vps52 / VPS52 ) as well as the ARP2 and VPS52 revertants ( arp2 D / D + ARP2 , vps52 D / D + VPS52 ) did . To analyse polarized morphogenesis in more detail , we stained strains with calcoﬂuor white ( CFW ) to assess what percentage of cells were growing as yeast , pseudohyphae or true hyphae ( Fig . 2B ) . Cells that had the ﬁrst septum / septin ring located in the growing bud tube and showed no constrictions at septal junctions were considered true hyphae ( Sudbery et al . , 2004 ) . Under the conditions tested , more than 96 % of the WT strain and both heterozygotes and revertants were growing as true hyphae . On the other hand , no true hyphal formation was observed in either arp2 D / D or vps52 D / D cells , while 60 % of arp2 D / D and 77 % of vps52 D / D cells were found to grow as pseudohyphae and 40 % of arp2 D / D and 23 % of vps52 D / D cells were still in the yeast state .

Screening for glycerol - sensitive mutants identiﬁed ORF19 . 875 . An over night culture was adjusted to OD 600 of 0 . 1 and then 10 - fold serially diluted . Two microlitres was then spotted , and plates were incubated for 2 days before being photographed . C . Examples of phenotypic hits involved in hyphal formation . Hyphae formation was assessed by spotting 10 m l of an over night culture diluted to OD 600 0 . 1 on different hyphae inducting media ( 10 % FBS and Spider ) or YPD media . Plates were incubated at 37°C for 2 – 3 days and photographed . Transposon insertions in CDC39 ( Tn : : cdc39 ) , VPS52 ( Tn : : vps52 ) and ARP2 ( Tn : : arp2 ) blocked wrinkle formation on the cell surface on all inducing media . The last column indicates the site of insertion , relative to the start codon , over the entire length of the ORF . See also Fig . S1 for morphology phenotypes associated with the remaining nine potential insertion mutant hits . 1184 E . Eppet al . (cid:2) © 2010 Crown in the right of Canada , Molecular Microbiology , 75 , 1182 – 1198 Taken together , the hyphal - deﬁcient transposon inser - tion phenotypes for ARP2 and VPS52 were conﬁrmed by deletion mutants and by reverting phenotypes after rein - troduction of the WT genes . Comparative genome hybrid - ization analysis further showed that no aneuploidies were found in the arp2 D / D or vps52 D / D strains ( Fig . S3 ) . Because other C . albicans vacuolar protein sorting ( VPS ) - type mutants such as vps11 D / D , vps28 D / D , vps32 D / D and the conditional vps1 D / VPS1 - tetR mutant showed hyphal formation defects similar to vps52 D / D cells ( Palmer et al . , 2003 ; Cornet et al . , 2005 ; Bernardo et al . , 2008 ) , we decided to focus further investigation on the Arp2 / 3 complex . C . albicans Arp2 / 3 complex mutants show dramatic actin cytoskeleton defects , but are still able to endocytose ARP2 encodes one of seven evolutionary conserved sub - units of the Arp2 / 3 complex , which nucleates actin ﬁla - ments ( F - actin ) into branched networks ( Machesky et al . , 1994 ; Welch et al . , 1997 ) . Given its conserved association Fig . 2 . VSP52 and Arp2 / 3 complex mutants do not form hyphae . A . Overnight cultures grown in YPD media were diluted 1 : 200 in YPD ( yeast conditions ) or YPD + 10 % FBS ( hyphae conditions ) and placed for 3 h at either 30°C ( yeast ) or 37°C ( hyphae ) . Both transposon and deletion mutants for VSP52 and ARP2 do not form hyphae under these conditions . Heterozgygous mutants and revertants behaved like WT .

Arp2 / 3mutantsinC . albicans 1185 © 2010 Crown in the right of Canada , Molecular Microbiology , 75 , 1182 – 1198 with actin regulation , we asked how deletion of ARP2 in C . albicans affects the actin cytoskeleton by staining loga - rithmically growing yeast cells with rhodamine / phalloidin ( Fig . 3 ) . In contrast to WT stained cells where actin patches are observed as bright dots localizing to sites of polarized growth , the C . albicans arp2 D / D mutant did not show such distinct , bright actin patches . Instead , the most prominent actin structures that formed in arp2 D / D cells were large ﬁlamentous aggregates similar to those observed in conditional arp2 and arp3 mutants of S . cer - evisiae or in bee1 / las17 yeast mutants , which also lack actin patches ( Li , 1997 ; Winter et al . , 1997 ; Martin et al . , 2005 ) . On the other hand , other actin - based structures such as actin cables and cytokinetic rings were still observed in arp2 D / D cells ( Fig . 3 ) . When only one copy of the ARP2 gene was present ( arp2 D / D + ARP2 ) , distinct actin patches were observed and hyphal formation was restored , but these patches appeared less frequent when compared with WT . A double KO mutant , where the two copies of both ARP2 and ARP3 were deleted ( arp2 D / D arp3 D / D ) , showed similar morphological phenotypes to the arp2 D / D single mutant . These mutants also exhibited hyphal formation defects , cells clumping together when grown in logarithmic phase , and individual cells appearing phenotypically round and swollen with a wider bud neck as well as similar actin cytoskeleton defects ( Figs 2 and 3 ) . Because assembly of actin ﬁlaments mediated by the Arp2 / 3 complex has been shown to be an essential part of endocytosis in a wide range of organisms ( for reviews see : Goley and Welch , 2006 ; Kaksonen et al . , 2006 ; Gal - letta and Cooper , 2009 ) , we stained C . albicans Arp2 / 3 complex mutants with the lipophilic dye FM4 - 64 , which is commonly used to visualize membrane internalization and endocytotic delivery to the vacuole ( Vida and Emr , 1995 ) . Both arp2 D / D and arp2 D / D arp3 D / D mutants were clearly able to deliver FM4 - 64 to the vacuole as observed by the intracellular appearance of the dye after a 45 min chase period ( Fig . 4A ) . In some Arp2 / 3 mutant cells , however , the vacuolar morphology appeared to be frag - mented , which sometimes resulted in staining throughout the vacuole . While in WT cells typically one to three vacu - oles were apparent , four or more smaller vacuoles could be observed in Arp2 / 3 complex mutant cells . This frag - mented vacuolar morphology has also been described for C . albicans wal1 D / D ( LAS17 in S . cerevisiae ) mutants , an activator of the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Walther and Wendland , 2004 ) . As some S . cerevisiae conditional Arp2 / 3 complex mutants were partially able to endocytose FM4 - 64 , but not LY ( Lucifer Yellow is a dye taken up by ﬂuid phase endocytosis ) ( Riezman , 1985 ; Moreau et al . , 1996 ; 1997 ; Martin et al . , 2005 ; Daugherty and Goode , 2008 ) , we assessed LY uptake in C . albicans Arp2 / 3 complex Fig . 3 . Assaying actin cytoskeleton structures in Arp2 / 3 complex mutants . Rhodamine / phalloidin staining was used to visualize the actin cytoskeleton in logarithmically growing yeast cells . In WT ( SN95 ) cells , actin patches localize to sites of polarized growth in most phases of the cell cycle . Independent of the cell cycle , distinctive actin patch structures were not observed in arp2 D / D or arp2 D / D arp3 D / D cells . Actin cables seemed unaffected in mutant cells . Bar = 5 m m . 1186 E . Eppet al . (cid:2) © 2010 Crown in the right of Canada , Molecular Microbiology , 75 , 1182 – 1198 mutants . No difference in LY uptake was observed in Arp2 / 3 mutants when compared with WT after 90 min incubation ( Fig . 4B ) . To quantitatively assess endocytosis , we performed time - lapse microscopy and included a C . albicans myo5 D / D mutant that has been shown to be endocytosis - defective ( Oberholzer et al . , 2004 ) . Co - incubation of GFP - labelled WT C . albicans with either arp2 D / D , arp2 D / D arp3 D / D or myo5 D / D cells conﬁrmed that endocytosis still occurred in arp2 D / D and arp2 D / D arp3 D / D mutants , while myo5 D / D cells did not endocytose FM4 - 64 within 3 h ( see movies 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 as well as Fig . S4 , which can be found in the Supporting information ) . However , vacuolar staining was somewhat delayed in arp2 D / D and arp2 D / D arp3 D / D cells ; FM4 - 64 staining appeared after 20 – 30 min in WT cells , and it took between 70 and 80 min until the dye reached the vacuole in the arp2 D / D and arp2 D / D arp3 D / D mutants . In both arp2 D / D , arp2 D / D arp3 D / D and myo5 D / D cells , the dye initially appeared as punctate - like dots apparently stuck in the plasma membrane . As dye - internalization occurred in arp2 D / D and arp2 D / D arp3 D / D cells over time , the bright dots at the membrane slowly faded at the same time as vacuolar staining began to emerge . In myo5 D / D cells , on the other hand , bright dot - like structures remained at the cell mem - brane until the end of our observations with no distinct vacuolar structures appearing . Taken together , these results suggest the Arp2 / 3 complex plays a crucial role in actin cytoskeleton organization in C . albicans , and while clearly delayed in endocytosis , Arp2 / 3 complex mutants can still endocytose as assessed by FM4 - 64 or LY uptake . Transcriptional analysis of Arp2 / 3 complex mutants To gain insights into cellular processes affected by dis - rupting Arp2 / 3 complex functions , we performed transcrip - tional proﬁling under yeast growth conditions ( YPD at 30°C for 3 h ) or hyphal induction ( YPD + 10 % FBS at 37°C for 3 h ) and compared transcriptional consequences of deleting ARP2 to MYO5 and SLA2 microarray data sets ( Oberholzer et al . , 2006 ) . MYO5 is an Arp2 / 3 complex activator , while SLA2 is an actin binding protein that couples actin to the vesicle coat during endocytosis ( Rob - ertson et al . , 2009a ) . Both sla2 D / D and myo5 D / D C . albi - cans mutants suffer similar related complications , such as no hyphal formation , delocalized actin patches and endocytosis defects ( Asleson et al . , 2001 ; Oberholzer et al . , 2002 ; 2004 ) . Despite using different chip platforms and different WT strains , there was a good overall corre - lation of the ARP2 microaray data set and the MYO5 and SLA2 data sets ( compare ‘HY Epp’ and ‘HY Oberholzer’ in Fig . 5A , Table S1 shows numerical values for each corre - lation coefficient ) . When signiﬁcantly regulated genes ( more than twofold , P < 0 . 05 ) were compared , deleting ARP2 , MYO5 or SLA2 resulted in similar cellular responses , although the overlap of regulated genes was Fig . 4 . Arp2 / 3 complex mutants can still endocytose FM4 - 64 and LY . A . Cells in logarithmic phase were incubated for 5 min with 20 m M FM4 - 64 , washed twice , chased for 45 min and visualized by epiﬂuorescence microscopy . Under these conditions , the dye is endocytosed and reliably visualized by vacuolar membrane staining in WT ( SN95 ) and mutant cells . B . Logarithmically growing cells were incubated with 4 mg ml - 1 Lucifer Yellow ( LY ) , incubated for 90 min , washed twice and visualized . LY is endocytosed in both WT and Arp2 / 3 complex mutants .

Arp2 / 3mutantsinC . albicans 1187 © 2010 Crown in the right of Canada , Molecular Microbiology , 75 , 1182 – 1198 much more signiﬁcant under yeast compared with hyphal growth conditions ( Fig . 5B and C ) . To further compare the transcriptional response of arp2 D / D mutants upon hyphal induction , hyphae - speciﬁc genes , i . e . genes that are sig - niﬁcantly regulated ( more than twofold , P < 0 . 05 ) in our WT - HY comparison , were clustered in Fig . 6 . Many of the genes in that list are known to become highly induced upon activation of the hyphal programme , for example ECE1 , ALS3 , HYR1 , SAP5 , SAP6 , HWP1 , RBT8 , IHD1 , PST1 , CIP1 , DCK1 and ORF19 . 1691 ( Nantel et al . , 2002 ; Garcia - Sanchez et al . , 2005 ; Kadosh and Johnson , 2005 ) ( Table S2 ) . Deleting ARP2 resulted in a global lack of hyphal - speciﬁc gene induction ( arp2 - H in Fig . 6 ) . When arp2 - Y was compared directly with arp2 - H , this observa - tion of improper hyphae - speciﬁc gene induction was con - ﬁrmed as > 92 % or 35 out of 38 of the most highly upregulated ( more than fourfold ) hyphae - speciﬁc genes were at least twofold less induced in the absence of ARP2 and > 95 % or 75 out of 79 of the remaining upregulated hyphae - speciﬁc genes were less induced in arp2 D / D mutants compared WT cells ( Fig . 6 , Table S2 ) . Deleting myo5 D / D resulted in a comparable response in that some hyphae - speciﬁc genes are not properly induced ( Ober - holzer et al . , 2006 ) . However , the lack of proper gene induction was much more pronounced in the absence of ARP2 than in the absence of MYO5 ( compare arp2 - H vs . myo5 - H in Fig . 6 , Table S3 ) . Together , these results suggest that while the ARP2 proﬁle showed signiﬁcant similarities to the MYO5 and SLA2 proﬁles under yeast growth conditions , there was less correlation under hyphal growth conditions possibly because of the pro - nounced lack of proper hyphal - speciﬁc gene induction in the absence of ARP2 . These observations suggest the failure in hyphal growth of Arp2 / 3 complex mutants could be a result of either impaired endocytosis , problems with the actin cytoskel - eton , failure to activate hyphal - speciﬁc genes or some combination of these defects . If the hyphal defect was primarily due to failure to activate gene expression , dere - pressing hyphal - speciﬁc gene expression by deleting the NRG1 repressor could potentially suppress the defect , as deletion of NRG1 leads to constitutive ﬁlamentous growth even in the absence of any hyphal induction signals ( Garcia - Sanchez et al . , 2005 ; Kadosh and Johnson , 2005 ) . We created an nrg1 D / D arp2 D / D mutant , which exhibited a doubling time more than twice as long as WT Fig . 5 . Transcript similarities of the ARP2 microaray data set and MYO5 / SLA2 data sets .

(cid:2) © 2010 Crown in the right of Canada , Molecular Microbiology , 75 , 1182 – 1198 ( Fig . S5 ) . When grown under non - inducing conditions , nrg1 D / D arp2 D / D cells showed the arp2 D / D mutant mor - phology of round and swollen cells . When induced for hyphal growth , nrg1 D / D arp2 D / D cells also exhibited the arp2 D / D cell morphology and did not form hyphae even after extended overnight incubation times ( Fig . 7 ) . We also attempted to create a tup1 D / D arp2 D / D mutant , but were not successful . To determine if the hyphal - speciﬁc genes are dere - pressed in the nrg1 D / D arp2 D / D mutant , we performed transcript proﬁling . We compared the nrg1 D / D arp2 D / D mutant grown under hyphal conditions to the arp2 D / D mutant grown under the same conditions ( YPD + 10 % serum , 37°C , 3 h ) and found that a signiﬁcant number of hyphal - speciﬁc genes that are normally induced when WT cells are undergoing the yeast - to - hyphae switch ( WT - HY ) showed greater expression in the nrg1 D / D arp2 D / D mutant compared with arp2 D / D cells ( P - value 4 . 9 ¥ 10 - 9 ) . When we examined the set of NRG1 - dependent hyphal - speciﬁc genes previously identiﬁed ( Kadosh and Johnson , 2005 ) , we found that seven of 28 genes ( HYR1 , SAP5 , SAP4 , KIP4 , ORF19 . 6079 , ALS3 and UME6 ) showed signiﬁ - cantly increased expression ( twofold or more ) in nrg1 D / D arp2 D / D cells compared with arp2 D / D cells , while a further four genes ( IHD1 , CBP1 , ORF19 . 6705 and ALS10 ) showed moderately increased expression between 1 . 5 - and 2 - fold ( Table S4 ) . Thus , while deleting a transcriptional repressor of the ﬁlamentation programme leads to derepression of many hyphal genes , the entire regulated gene set is not derepressed ; this presumably reﬂects the complex interplay that different transcriptional ( co - ) repressors exert on the yeast - to - hyphae transition ( Garcia - Sanchez et al . , 2005 ; Kadosh and Johnson , 2005 ) . We further found that despite the increased induc - tion of some hyphal genes in the nrg1 D / D arp2 D / D mutant , a few of those genes are not as highly induced as in WT cells ( Table S4 ) . One gene that was induced in both the ‘ nrg1 D / D arp2 D / D vs arp2 D / D ’ and the ‘ nrg1 D / D arp2 D / D vs WT’ comparisons is UME6 , a recently identiﬁed key regu - Fig . 6 . Cluster tree of hyphae - speciﬁc genes . While the majority of hyphae - speciﬁc genes are not properly induced in the absence of ARP2 , MYO5 or SLA2 , this lack of hyphal gene induction is most prominent in arp2 D / D cells . Table S2 reports values used to create this cluster tree . Fig . 7 . The nrg1 D / D arp2 D / D mutant phenocopies arp2 D / D cell morphologies . Hyphal formation was assayed as described in Fig . 2A . Deletion of one transcriptional repressor for hyphal - speciﬁc genes , NRG1 , leads to constitutive ﬁlamentous growth even in the absence of any hyphal signals ( yeast ) . Deleting NRG1 in the arp2 D / D mutant ( nrg1 D / D arp2 D / D ) did not restore ﬁlamentous growth even in the presence of hyphal signals ( hyphae ) . Bar = 10 m m . Arp2 / 3mutantsinC . albicans 1189 © 2010 Crown in the right of Canada , Molecular Microbiology , 75 , 1182 – 1198 lator of the hyphal programme ( Banerjee et al . , 2008 ; Zeidler et al . , 2009 ) . Interestingly , although constitutive overexpression of UME6 in WT cells resulted in constitu - tive ﬁlamentous growth even in the absence of hyphae signals ( Carlisle et al . , 2009 ) , the increased expression level of UME6 in the nrg1 D / D arp2 D / D mutant is not suffi - cient to restore ﬁlamentation in the absence of a func - tional Arp2 / 3 complex . Thus despite partial derepression of the hyphal programme , hyphae do not form , making it likely other roles of the Arp2 / 3 complex , such as its func - tion in actin patch formation and actin branching , are required for hyphal development . Conﬁrming ‘actin - patch’ phenotypes Besides defects in ﬁlamentous growth , many phenotypes found in myo5 D / D and sla2 D / D mutants have been linked to the Arp2 / 3 complex and include cell membrane and cell wall defects as well as salt sensitivity ( Oberholzer et al . , 2006 ) . We tested whether these actin patch - associated phenotypes are also observed in Arp2 / 3 complex mutants . arp2 D / D and arp2 D / D arp3 D / D cells showed typical actin - patch phenotypes such as salt sensitivity as well as cell wall and cell membrane defects , illustrated by increased sensitivity to congo red , CFW , SDS and hygro - mycin B . Arp2 / 3 complex mutants also showed abnormal cell wall patterning with aberrant , relatively random chitin deposition ( Fig . 8 ) . Transcriptional analysis also showed that many ergos - terol genes ( e . g . ERG1 , ERG5 , ERG6 , ERG10 , ERG11 , ERG27 and ERG252 ) were downregulated when arp2 D / D cells were compared with WT cells in either yeast or hyphae condition ( Table S5 ) . We reasoned that Arp2 / 3 complex mutants might be more sensitive to drugs target - ing this important component of fungal cell membranes . Figure 9 illustrates that both arp2 D / D and arp2 D / D arp3 D / D mutants showed increased sensitivity to the ergosterol targeting drug ﬂuconazole , a phenotype that has also been described for mob2 D / D cells , a key component of the RAM pathway that showed additional related actin - patch phenotypes ( Song et al . , 2008 ) . Taken together , many actin patch - associated phenotypes previously described for myo5 D / D , sla2 D / D , wal1 D / D and mob2 D / D cells could be conﬁrmed with Arp2 / 3 complex mutants . A functional Arp2 / 3 complex is required for virulence Because the yeast - to - hyphae switch is one important viru - lence attribute , we tested the arp2 D / D mutant for fungal replication in a complement - 5 ( C5 ) - deﬁcient mouse model Fig . 8 . Arp2 / 3 complex mutants show typical actin patch - associated phenotypes . A . Plate spotting assays were done as described in Fig . 1 legend .

Mice infected with the WT strain SN95 were moribund after 24 h post infection , while all mice infected with arp2 D / D cells did not show any clinical signs such as lethargy , ruffled fur or hunched back even on day 4 post infection ( Fig . 10A ) . This observation was con - ﬁrmed by measuring fungal load from the kidney , the site of highest fungal replication in the A / J mouse model ( Mullick et al . , 2004 ) . WT - infected mice had a signiﬁcantly higher fungal burden at 24 h post infection compared with the arp2 D / D - infected mice sacriﬁced at the same time and at 4 days post infection hardly any fungal cells could be recovered from the kidneys of mice infected with arp2 D / D mutants ( Fig . 10B ) . To gain further insights into the host – pathogen interac - tion and whether arp2 D / D cells trigger a host response despite their reduced capacity to replicate in the A / J mice background , we biochemically analysed the host blood collected by heart puncture at 24 h post infection . We focused on two metabolic markers that typically show a speciﬁc response upon infection with C . albicans ( Mullick et al . , 2006 ) : levels of interleukin 6 ( IL - 6 ) , a key inﬂamma - tory cytokine , and creatine kinase ( CK ) , a cardiac protein , both of which become highly upregulated upon encounter with C . albicans . The blood from arp2 D / D mutant - infected mice had signiﬁcantly lower levels of IL - 6 compared with WT - infected mice ( Fig . 10C ) . Likewise , signiﬁcantly lower amounts of CK were found in blood collected from mice infected with arp2 D / D compared with the WT - infected mice ( Fig . 10D ) . These results indicate that arp2 D / D cells do not trigger a normal host response as determined by IL - 6 and CK levels . Taken together , based on survival time , fungal burden and the biochemical analysis of the host blood , we conclude that C . albicans arp2 D / D mutants are avirulent in this mouse model of infection . Discussion While the complete sequence of the C . albicans genome ( assembly 20 became available in 2006 ) , in combination with molecular tools such as epitope - tagging , inducible promoters , reporter genes , auxotrophic and dominant markers , has tremendously facilitated functional analysis in C . albicans ( Care et al . , 1999 ; Reuss et al . , 2004 ; Nantel , 2006 ; Schaub et al . , 2006 ; Lavoie et al . , 2008 ) , a comprehensive genome - wide collection of C . albicans mutants is not available , although clearly desirable for functional genomics . The inherent difficulty of genetic manipulation in C . albicans has resulted in only a few large - scale mutagenesis efforts capable of directly linking a gene to a cellular function ( Roemer et al . , 2003 ; Uhl et al . , 2003 ; Nobile and Mitchell , 2005 ; Bruno et al . , 2006 ; Shen et al . , 2008 ) . Here , we have investigated a forward genetics approach in C . albicans . Screening of 4700 insertion mutants showed that VPS52 and ARP2 are essential for the yeast - to - hyphae transition , demonstrat - ing that this approach can successfully link genes to a phenotype of interest in C . albicans . Advantages of forward genetics in C . albicans Given that mutating any of the seven Arp2 / 3 complex subunits resulted in severe growth defects or lethality in S . cerevisiae , Schizosaccharomyces pombe , Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhbditis elegans ( Lees - Miller et al . , 1992 ; Schwob and Martin , 1992 ; Balasubramanian et al . , 1996 ; Mccollum et al . , 1996 ; Winter et al . , 1997 ; 1999 ; Hudson and Cooley , 2002 ; Zallen et al . , 2002 ; Sawa et al . , 2003 ) , we were surprised that in C . albicans loss of two Arp2 / 3 complex subunits does not severely compro - mise viability ( Fig . S5 ) . Using reverse genetics by relying on other yeast models might have led to incorrect assump - tions that theArp2 / 3 complex is essential in C . albicans and therefore it might have escaped functional characteriza - tion . Functional analysis based on alternate models would also have proven challenging in linking ORF19 . 875 , an uncharacterized gene in C . albicans with no obvious homo - logues in S . cerevisiae or S . pombe ( Arnaud et al . , 2007 ) , to a glycerol growth defect phenotype ( Fig . 1B ) . These two examples demonstrate the utility of unbiased large - scale mutagenesis directly in C . albicans . Limitations of forward genetics in C . albicans Why did only two new robust ﬁlamentation phenotypes result out of 4700 potentially homozygosed orf : : UAU1 / orf : : URA3 mutants ? First , only about 50 % of the inser - tions were directly in an ORF or in a putative promoter Fig . 9 . Arp2 / 3 complex mutants show increased ﬂuconazole sensitivity . arp2 D / D and arp2 D / D arp3 D / D mutants are more sensitive to the ergosterol targeting drug ﬂuconazole compared with WT and revertant strains . Serial dilution and spotting was done as describe in Fig . 1 legend . Arp2 / 3mutantsinC . albicans 1191 © 2010 Crown in the right of Canada , Molecular Microbiology , 75 , 1182 – 1198 region ( see Supporting information ) . For our analysis , we restricted in - depth characterization and deletion mutant construction of orf : : UAU1 / orf : : URA3 mutants to ORF insertions , because these showed the most con - sistent and pronounced phenotypes . Second , many insertion mutants were aneuploid , consistent with previ - ous ﬁndings when directed UAU1 plasmids were used ( Enloe et al . , 2000 ) , or showed major chromosomal rear - rangements on chromosomes other than where the initial UAU1 marker had inserted ( Figs S2 and S3 ) . Finally , we cannot exclude multiple insertions per trans - formant , which might explain why we could not map some insertions . As well , insertions into repeated regions can be difficult to map . For instance , we had several interesting phenotypes mapped to genes of the TLO ( TeLOmere - associated gene ) family , but because these genes are known to contain 80 % or more similar - ity ( van het Hoog et al . , 2007 ) we could not conveniently map the insertions to a single gene . Taken together , based on random selection and veriﬁ - cation of the WT band , we speculate that out of the 4700 potentially homozygosed orf : : UAU1 / orf : : URA3 mutants , about 5 % or 200 would be simple homozygous gene insertion mutants with no aneuploidy at the site of insertion . This would make the overall isolation rate of hyphal defects close to one in 100 genes inactivated . Fig . 10 . The Arp2 / 3 complex is required for virulence in an A / J mouse model .

Error bars indicate the standard errors of the means . 1192 E . Eppet al . (cid:2) © 2010 Crown in the right of Canada , Molecular Microbiology , 75 , 1182 – 1198 Exploiting the non - essential function of the Arp2 / 3 complex in C . albicans The actin cytoskeleton plays a crucial role in cell polarity across most eukaryotes and hyphal growth in several fungal species in particular ( Pruyne and Bretscher , 2000 ; Steinberg , 2007 ) . In C . albicans , for instance , the impor - tance of actin cytoskeleton structure and dynamics to morphogenesis was shown by experiments where C . albi - cans cells treated with Cytochalasin A , an actin monomer sequestering drug , led to hyphal formation defects while preserving other cellular growth processes ( Akashi et al . , 1994 ) . Subsequent work demonstrated a link between actin cytoskeleton stability and hyphae - speciﬁc gene expression , observations that corroborate our ﬁndings in that disrupting the Arp2 / 3 complex prevented morphologi - cal switching and that many hyphal - speciﬁc genes are not properly induced . This is consistent with the idea that besides a complex transcriptional regulatory system the actin cytoskeleton itself could inﬂuence hyphal gene acti - vation ( Hazan and Liu , 2002 ; Wolyniak and Sundstrom , 2007 ) , potentially through cAMP signalling ( Zou et al . , 2009 ) . However , our data also show that partial derepres - sion of the hyphal programme does not restore hyphae formation in the absence of a functional Arp2 / 3 complex , suggesting that in Arp2 / 3 complex mutants , additional factors are involved . Several actin - patch phenotypes previously described for C . albicans myo5 D / D , wal1 D / D , sla2 D / D or RAM pathway mutants could be conﬁrmed with arp2 D / D and arp2 D / D arp3 D / D mutants . While a link between the Arp2 / 3 complex and the two Arp2 / 3 complex activators , WAL1 and MYO5 , or SLA2 , an actin binding protein , are more obvious , it remains speculative how the RAM pathway could inﬂuence actin dynamics in general and the Arp2 / 3 complex in particular . Of all phenotypes displayed by Arp2 / 3 complex mutants , the most surprising was the ability to endocytose as it is now widely accepted that actin patches are the major sites of endocytosis from yeast to mammals ( Kaksonen et al . , 2006 ; Moseley and Goode , 2006 ; Smythe and Ayscough , 2006 ; Galletta and Cooper , 2009 ) . In general , although delayed , arp2 D / D and arp2 D / D arp3 D / D cells were clearly able to endocytose LY and FM4 - 64 , which was not the case for the Arp2 / 3 complex activator Myo5p ( compare movie 2 with movie 3 , Supporting information ) , suggesting that in myo5 D / D cells Arp2 / 3 complex - independent , MYO5 - dependent path - ways exist that contribute to plasma membrane compo - nent uptake . Together with our microarray studies that showed that the degree of similarity of the transcriptional response of arp2 D / D and myo5 D / D mutants was condition - dependent , this supports previous conclusions ( Ober - holzer et al . , 2006 ) that some myo5 D / D phenotypes are Arp2 / 3 complex - independent . The process of endocytosis can be divided into four phases ( Robertson et al . , 2009a ) . During the earliest phase , assembly of the endocytic coat complex takes place and involves cargo recruitment , initial membrane curvature to facilitate the invagination process , as well as recruitment of proteins that will trigger actin polarization . This initial process seems unaffected in Arp2 / 3 complex mutants as bright FM4 - 64 dots still accumulate at the plasma membrane prior to membrane internalization in both WT and arp2 D / D and arp2 D / D arp3 D / D deletion mutants . These observations are consistent with the model that this ﬁrst step of endocytosis is actin - independent ( Robertson et al . , 2009a ) . During the second step of endocytosis , WT cells invaginate the FM4 - 64 - loaded vesicles , while inArp2 / 3 complex mutants a distinct invagi - nation was not observed , again in good agreement with current models in thatArp2 / 3 complex - mediated actin poly - merization is a central driving force during this step of membrane invagination . Instead , in arp2 D / D and arp2 D / D arp3 D / D mutants bright distinct dots appeared to be stuck in the membrane with little movement within the membrane and no appearance of invagination even after 3 h . Finally , during later steps of endocytosis , vesicle scission and movement away from the plasma membrane was readily detected in WT cells showing internalization of rapidly moving vesicles with subsequent dye accumulation in the vacuole . While although vacuolar dye accumulation was observed somewhat delayed and appeared overall weaker in Arp2 / 3 complex mutants , vacuolar accumulation of FM4 - 64 gradually occurred concomitantly with fading of the plasma membrane staining . Curiously , this vacuolar staining appeared independent of vesicle movement , as no clear , distinct vesicles emanating from the plasma membrane could be detected . This observation is lending support to recent reports in S . cerevisiae that Arp2 / 3 - independent routes for actin - driven polymerization could be involved in endocytosis ( Robertson et al . , 2009b ) , an idea that is particularly attractive in more distantly related eukaryotes like red algae where BLAST searches did not detect Arp2 / 3 complex subunits ( Galletta and Cooper , 2009 ) . While more work is needed to reﬁne the interplay of various endocytotic machinery components and the Arp2 / 3 complex in order to explore their spatiotemporal involvement in processes such as endocytosis or ﬁlamen - tous growth in C . albicans , the Arp2 / 3 complex mutants in this molecularly manipulatible model organism provide a powerful tool to probe this process in greater depth . Experimental procedures Strains , plasmids , primers and media Strains , plasmids and primers ( oligonucleotides ) used in this study are listed in Tables S6 – S8 . YPD media consisted of Arp2 / 3mutantsinC . albicans 1193 © 2010 Crown in the right of Canada , Molecular Microbiology , 75 , 1182 – 1198 1 % yeast extract , 2 % peptone , 2 % dextrose and 2 % agar supplemented with 50 mg l - 1 of uridine . YPD + 10 % FBS and Spider media ( 1 % Difco nutrient broth , 1 % mannitol , 0 . 2 % K 2 HPO 4 , 1 . 35 % agar , pH 7 . 2 ) , two media known to potently induce hyphal formation , were used for the hyphae screen ( Liu et al . , 1994 ; Uhl et al . , 2003 ) . SD media con - tained 2 % dextrose , 6 . 7 % yeast nitrogen base without amino acids , 2 % agar and was supplemented with the appropriate amino acids . In vivo random mutagenesis and mapping the mutation The Escherichia coli - based UAU1 plasmid pool ( Davis et al . , 2002 ) was ﬁrst ampliﬁed on Luria broth ( LB ) plates supple - mented with 50 m g ml - 1 kanamycin and 50 m g ml - 1 ampicillin at 37°C for 2 days followed by a 2 h liquid incubation at 37°C . For each transformation round into C . albicans , roughly 5 m g of a maxi - kit ( Quiagen ) extracted plasmid mix was Not I - digested and transformed ( Chen et al . , 1992 ) into BWP17 ( relevant genotype : ura3 / ura3 his1 / his1 arg4 / arg4 ) ( Wilson et al . , 1999 ) . The orf : : UAU1 / ORF heterozygotes were selected on SD - Arg + Uri plates , patched on YPD media , grown at 30°C for 1 – 2 days and serially replica - plated up to eight times onto SD - Arg - Ura plates selecting for orf : : UAU1 / orf : : URA3 homozygotes . Generally , ~ 94 % of the orf : : UAU1 / ORF heterozygotes gave rise to one or more orf : : UAU1 / orf : : URA3 homozygote colonies when replica - plated to SD - Arg - Ura plates from YPD plates compared with ~ 30 % of heterozygotes that generated homozygotes when replica - plating the transformation plates directly to SD - Arg - Ura plates . For phenotypic analysis , potential orf : : UAU1 / orf : : URA3 insertion mutants were screened for a desired phenotype and simultaneously for Arg + / Ura + prototrophy . If a desired phenotype was detected , a single colony of that mutant was selected , retested for growth on SD - Arg and SD - Ura media to verify segregation of the markers and at the same time retested for robustness of the desired phenotype . Only when each colony of this second testing showed a consistent phenotype , i . e . growth on SD - Arg , SD - Ura media together with a stable phenotype , was the insertion mapped . If the insertion was mapped directly in an ORF and no WT band was found by PCR analysis , a deletion mutant was constructed of this gene . To map the transposon insertions inverse PCR was per - formed ( Ochman et al . , 1988 ) . For all mutants where we used inverse PCR or PCR to verify the absence of a WT band in orf : : UAU1 / orf : : URA3 mutants , a single colony was isolated and genomic DNA was extracted . Brieﬂy , 20 m g of extracted DNA ( Rose et al . , 1990 ) was puriﬁed using an ice - cold 2 . 5 M NH 4 AcO solution ( Maniatis et al . , 1982 ) . Mbo I ( New England Biolabs , NEB ) was added at 2 U m g - 1 of DNA and incubated at 37 C for 2 h . After enzyme inactivation and dilution of the DNA , T4 DNA ligase ( NEB ) was added to circularize the fragments that were then PCR - ampliﬁed with Taq polymerase ( NEB ) and oligonucleotides ( primers ) oEE5 / oEE6 . PCR products were sequenced with primers oEE9 and oEE23 at the Genome Sequencing Centre at McGill ( http : / / www . genomequebecplatforms . com / mcgill ) . Sequences obtained after inverse PCR were mapped using the BLAST tools on the CDG homepage ( http : / / www . candidagenome . org / ) . Deletion mutant construction and phenotypic analysis Strain SN95 ( Noble and Johnson , 2005 ) was used for dele - tion mutant constructions . For each deletion mutant , at least two homozygotes derived from two different heterozygotes were constructed . One hundred - mer or 120 - mer oligos ﬂank - ing the coding sequence of genes ARP2 or VPS52 were used to amplify the Arginine and Histidine auxotrophic marker cas - settes ( Wilson et al . , 1999 ) for sequential disruption of both alleles . For the arp2 D / D arp3 D / D double mutant , a fusion PCR approach and strain SN148 were used ( Noble and Johnson , 2005 ) . Correct integration of the marker cassettes and the absence of the WT gene were veriﬁed for each mutant by standard PCR analysis ( Schaub et al . , 2006 ) ( Fig . S2 ) . In order to reintegrate the WT gene in each mutant at the WT locus , the nourseothricin marker was used ( Reuss et al . , 2004 ) . Brieﬂy , the WT gene was ampliﬁed with primers oEE166 / oEE228 , oEE174 / oEE232 , oEE170 / oEE229 for genes ARP2 , VPS52 and ORF19 . 875 , respectively , and cloned into the Kpn I / Xho I - digested pSFS2A plasmid ( Reuss et al . , 2004 ) . The resulting plasmids , designated pEE22 , pEE18 and pEE23 , were sequenced . Downstream ﬂanking sequences for ARP2 , VPS52 and ORF19 . 875 were ampliﬁed with primers oEE167 / oEE169 , oEE233 / oEE234 and oEE230 / oEE231 and cloned into the Not I / Sac II - digested plasmids pEE22 , pEE18 and pEE23 respectively . This resulted in plas - mids pEE33 , pEE20 and pEE30 , which were then Kpn I / Sac II - digested and directly transformed into the corresponding deletion mutant . Selection was done on 200 m g ml - 1 of nourseothricin , and correct integration was veriﬁed by PCR analysis . Finally , before revertant phenotypes were com - pared with mutant and WT phenotypes , the nourseothricin marker cassette was looped out by incubating the revertants for 6 h in YP media supplemented with 2 % maltose . Loop out of the SAT1 ﬂipper cassette was conﬁrmed by nourseothricin sensitivity , Histidine or Arginine auxotrophy and ﬁnally by PCR analysis ( not shown ) . The nrg1 D / D arp2 D / D mutant was created in the nrg1 D / D deletion strain ( Murad et al . , 2001 ) . Brieﬂy , the upstream ﬂanking sequence of ARP2 was ﬁrst ampliﬁed with primers oEE166 / oEE382 and cloned into the Kpn I / Not I - digested plasmid pEE33 , which resulted in plasmid pEE59 . This plasmid was then used to sequentially delete both alleles of the ARP2 gene in the nrg1 D / D mutant . Microscopy and time - lapse For microscopic analysis , an upright Leitz Aristoplan or an inverted Leica DMIRE2 microscope with a 100 ¥ immersion oil objective , and a 10 ¥ projection lense was used . Character - ization of Arp2 / 3 complex mutant phenotypes was done as previously described for CFW , rhodamine / phalloidin and FM4 - 64 staining in ( Vida and Emr , 1995 ; Oberholzer et al . , 2002 ) and LY visualization in ( Baggett et al . , 2003 ) . Time - lapse movies ( Supporting information ) were per - formed with TEF1 - GFP labelled WT cells that were co - incubated with mutant cells in a one - to - one ratio . Cells were grown to exponential phase and washed with SD media . Agar slides were prepared as follows : 0 . 75 ml of half strength YPD media was mixed with 0 . 75 ml of 3 . 4 % Agarose ( pre - heated ) after which 1 m l of FM4 - 64 ( 200 m g ml - 1 , in dimethyl - sulphoxide ) was added . A total of 100 m l of this mixture was 1194 E . Eppet al . (cid:2) © 2010 Crown in the right of Canada , Molecular Microbiology , 75 , 1182 – 1198 then transferred to the deep well slides and covered with a coverslip without sealing . After the medium had solidiﬁed , the coverslip was removed ; 1 m l of mixed WT / mutant culture was applied and covered with a fresh coverslip on top . Differential interference contrast ( DIC ) and GFP images were taken prior to time - lapse microscopy to distinguish between WT and mutant cells ( Fig . S4 ) . Time - lapse image acquisition started 5 minafterapplicationofthecellsandwasfollowedfor3 hwith one image per minute . Images were taken with a Zeiss Axio Imager M1 microscope with a Photometrics Coolsnap HQ camera . Image acquisition and movie ﬁle assembly was per - formed with Metamorph 7 software ( Molecular Devices ) . Comparative genome hybridization and microarray studies Comparative genome hybridization analysis was done as previously described ( Znaidi et al . , 2007 ) with the following modiﬁcations . Genomic DNA was extracted from a C . albi - cans culture grown to saturation with the Qiagen Genomic DNA Extraction kit according to manufacturer’s instructions . DNA hybridization was done with the Advalytix SlideBooster for 16 h at 42°C according to manufacturer’s instructions . For the transcriptional proﬁling experiment , total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini kit ( Qiagen ) . Total RNA quantiﬁcation was measured by nanodrop ( ND - 1000 spectro - photometer , NanoDrop Technologies ) . The quality of the mRNA was veriﬁed with a RNA lab - on - chip assay using a 2100 expert mRNA nano BIO analyser ( Agilent ) . cDNA label - ling , DNA microarray hybridization , washing and scanning was adapted from a standardized protocol ( Nantel et al . , 2006 ) . Each condition was covered by a minimum of three DNA microarrays , and results were analysed using Gene - Spring software ( Silicon Genetics , Redwood City , CA ) . In order to compare signiﬁcantly overlapping gene lists , the P - value was calculated using hypergeometric distribution as described in the GO Term Finder Tool web site ( http : / / www . candidagenome . org / cgi - bin / GO / goTermFinder ) . Gene lists can be found in Tables S2 – S5 . The entire data set for all microarray experiments has also been deposited at GEO under the accession number GSE19583 . ( http : / / www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov / geo ) . For calculating the Pearson correlation , GraphPad Prism 5 was used . Virulence studies Virulence testing of C . albicans , including survival experi - ments , tissue fungal burden counting and biochemical analy - sis of the host blood , was done as previously described ( Mullick et al . , 2004 ; 2006 ) . Brieﬂy , 8 - to 12 - week - oldA / J mice ( Jackson Laboratories , Bar Harbor , ME ) were inoculated via the tail vein with 200 m l of a suspension containing 3 ¥ 10 5 C . albicans in PBS . Three male and three female mice were used for each experimental group . Mice were closely moni - tored over a period of maximal 4 days for clinical signs of disease such as lethargy , ruffled fur or hunched back . Mice showing extreme lethargy were considered moribund and were euthanized . All experimental procedures involving animals were approved by the Biotechnology Research Insti - tute Animal Care Committee , which operates under the guidelines of the Canadian Council of Animal Care .

We found that in six of these 24 mutants the transposon had inserted directly in an open reading frame ( ORF ) , in a further six the transposon had inserted in the promoter region ( < 1 kb upstream of an ORF ) , in four transformants the insertion was less than 1 kb downstream of an ORF , while six transposons had inserted in a clear intergenic region ( > 1 kb away from any ORF ) and two insertions could not be mapped . One of the two unmapped insertions was flanked by an E . coli sequence , but how this transposon construct was inserted into the C . albicans genome along with E . coli coding sequence is unclear . The other unmapped insertion generated an unusually large , very faint band after inverse PCR that gave ambiguous sequence . We used Mbo I ( restriction digestion site : GATC ) to generate the inverse PCR template , so it is possible that this insertion falls in a region with infrequent Mbo I sites and thus was difficult to amplify . Next , we checked the six ORF and the six promoter insertion mutants for aneuploidy . PCR analysis showed that in only one instance was the WT gene clearly missing ( Figure S2E , left ) . Thus , while recombination of a transposon insertion into a gene or potential regulatory region is efficient , insertions that ultimately create a clean homozygous diploid orf : : UAU1 / orf : : URA3 mutant can be as low as one out of 24 after random selection . 2 SI Figure S1 . Potential hypo - filamentation phenotypes recovered from the screen Hyphal formation was assessed as described in Figure legend 1 . The mutants listed here showed reduced wrinkle formation on Spider media , YPD + 10 % FBS or on both , but all of these mutants could still form true hyphae under liquid inducing conditions ( not shown ) . For each mutant , a description from CGD ( www . candidagenome . org ) and the site of insertion relative to the start codon of the coding sequence is given in the last column . 3 SI Figure S2 . PCR confirmation of mutant construction For each deletion mutant , genomic DNA was used to confirm correct integration of the marker cassettes as well as the absence of the WT gene after the second allele was knocked out . In each case , at least two different homozygous mutants were derived from two independently transformed heterozygotes to ascertain mutant phenotypes . Strain names are given above each picture ( SN95 was used as WT , X represent additional mutants not further used ) , and primers as well as PCR product sizes ( in brackets ) are indicated . A . Deletion mutant construction for orf19 . 875 Δ / Δ . B . Deletion mutant construction for arp2 Δ / Δ . C . Deletion mutant construction for arp2 Δ / Δ arp3 Δ / Δ double knock out . D . Deletion mutant construction for vps52 Δ / Δ . E . Examples of PCR confirmation to verify the absence of the WT band in different orf : : UAU1 / orf : : URA3 insertion mutants . Genomic DNA isolated from a single colony was used in each case . PCR primers were designed so that they flank the site of initial UAU1 insertion by at least 300 bp . Note that this verification strategy could potentially be misleading in cases where the insertion has integrated at non - homologous locations . No WT band was detected in Tn : : 875 , Tn : : arp2 , Tn : : vps52 , Tn : : cdc39 and Tn : : r5 , while a WT band was still present in mutants Tn : : r1 , Tn : : r6 and Tn : : r8 . The insertion mutant allele bands , which are roughly three kb larger than the WT band , were not amplified under the PCR conditions used . “ Tn : : r ” refers to randomly chosen mutants ( see supplementary text ) . 4 SI Figure S3 . The UAU1 system can introduce major chromosomal rearrangements Cy3 labeled genomic DNA from either three randomly chosen UAU1 mutants ( Tn : : r4 , Tn : : r6 and Tn : : r9 ) or from strain SN95 was hybridized to DNA microarrays with Cy5 labeled genomic DNA from the reference strain SC5314 . Shown are plots of CGH ( comparative genome hybridization ) analyses , where the y - axis shows the log2 fluorescence ratio of the mutant strains versus SC5314 and the x - axis shows all chromosomes ( 1 to R ) . A single black rhombus represents the log2 fluorescence ratio plotted as a function of its position in the C . albicans’ assembly 21 . In this representation , a 1 . 5 - fold increase in fluorescence ratio ( i . e . three chromosome copies versus two ) equals a log2 ratio of ∼ 0 . 58 . A . Mutant Tn : : r4 has at least one more copy of chromosome four and one copy less of chromosome seven compared to SC5314 . The UAU1 cassette integrated on chromosome three . B . Mutant Tn : : r6 has acquired at least one copy each for chromosomes one , three , seven and R , while chromosomes two , four , five and six have lost at least one copy each . The UAU1 cassette integrated on chromosome R . C - F . No aneuploidy was detected in mutant Tn : : r9 , SN95 and the deletion mutants for arp2 Δ / Δ and vps52 Δ / Δ . 5 SI Figure S4 . Coincubation of mutant and WT strains during time - lapse analysis . A GFP - labeled WT strain was coincubated with different mutant strains to simulate equal conditions for time - lapse analysis . The pictures shown here represent images taken at the beginning of time - lapse movies to distinguish between WT and mutant strains . Movie 1 shows the arp2 Δ / ARP2 heterozygous mutant and WT cells , movie 2 shows the arp2 Δ / Δ deletion mutant and WT cells , movie 3 shows the myo5 Δ / Δ deletion mutant and WT cells , and movie 4 shows the arp2 Δ / Δ arp3 Δ / Δ double deletion mutant and WT cells . Movies can be found in the supplementary material . 6 SI Figure S5 . Growth properties of VSP52 , NRG1 and Arp2 / 3 complex mutants . To measure growth , an overnight culture of each strain was diluted to an OD 600 of 0 . 5 in YPD media and incubated at 30 ° C with constant shaking . OD 600 measurements were taken at indicated times . The doubling time was equal to ln2 / [ ( ln ( A / A 0 ) / t ] where A is the OD 600 at time t ( 12 hours ) , A o is the initial OD 600 ( 2 hours ) and t is the time ( 10 hours ) . 7 SI Table S1 .
