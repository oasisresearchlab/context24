Pearson , Paul S . Maddox , E . D . Salmon , and Kerry Bloom Department of Biology , University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill , Chapel Hill , North Carolina 27599 Abstract . Using green ﬂuorescent protein probes and rapid acquisition of high - resolution ﬂuorescence images , sister centromeres in budding yeast are found to be separated and oscillate between spindle poles before anaphase B spindle elongation . The rates of movement during these oscillations are similar to those of microtu - bule plus end dynamics . The degree of preanaphase sep - aration varies widely , with infrequent centromere reas - sociations observed before anaphase . Centromeres are in a metaphase - like conformation , whereas chromo - some arms are neither aligned nor separated before anaphase . Upon spindle elongation , centromere to pole movement ( anaphase A ) was synchronous for all cen - tromeres and occurred coincident with or immediately after spindle pole separation ( anaphase B ) . Chromatin proximal to the centromere is stretched poleward before and during anaphase onset . The stretched chromatin was observed to segregate to the spindle pole bodies at rates greater than centromere to pole movement , indica - tive of rapid elastic recoil between the chromosome arm and the centromere . These results indicate that the elas - tic properties of DNA play an as of yet undiscovered role in the poleward movement of chromosome arms . Key words : budding yeast • motility • mitosis • chromosome dynamics • centromeres Introduction The discovery of centromere DNA and kinetochore proteins in budding yeast has been dependent upon genetic and biochemical assays . These studies indicate that many proteins and features of mitosis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae appear to be analogous to those of mammalian tissue cul - ture cells , making budding yeast an excellent genetic system to study the molecular mechanisms of mitosis ( Maney et al . , 2000 ; Pidoux and Allshire , 2000 ; O’Toole and Winey , 2001 ) . The mechanics of chromosome segregation in budding yeast has been difficult to analyze because of its small size and problems produced by the lack of chromosome conden - sation during mitosis . The 1 . 5 – 2 - m m preanaphase spindle labeled with green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) 1 – tubulin probes appears as two bright fluorescent half - spindles joined by a region of much lower fluorescence intensity in the middle of the spindle ( Maddox et al . , 2000 ) . EM has shown a central spindle composed of approximately four overlapping microtubules from each pole . Also emanating from each pole are microtubules peripheral to the central spindle and extending on average 0 . 3 m m towards the spin - dle equator ( Peterson and Ris , 1976 ; Winey et al . , 1995 ; O’Toole et al . , 1999 ) . These microtubules have been pro - posed to be individual kinetochore microtubules linking centromeres to the spindle poles ( Peterson and Ris , 1976 ; Winey et al . , 1995 ; O’Toole et al . , 1999 ) . The average num - ber of these microtubules , 16 , matches the number of chromosomes , however , they do not reach the spindle equator , indicating that kinetochore proteins or cen - tromeres must either be elongated or separated to attain a bipolar attachment ( Winey et al . , 1995 ; O’Toole et al . , 1999 ) . The medial lengths of these presumptive kineto - chore microtubules decrease in anaphase 0 . 3 – 0 . 03 m m , as expected for centromere movement to the spindle poles ( anaphase A ) ( O’Toole et al . , 1999 ) . However , it has not been possible to identify either centromere chromatin densities or kinetochores at the ends of these peripheral microtubules . As a result , it has been difficult to identify centromere position and their movement to the poles during anaphase . Major advances in our understanding of how chromo - somes move during mitosis in budding yeast have come from the development of live cell imaging and GFP probes for marking spindle microtubules , spindle poles , cen - tromeres ( kinetochores ) , and loci along chromosome arms . To determine how chromosomes move and when chromosomes separate during mitosis , Straight et al . ( 1997 ) generated fluorescent marks on chromosome arms by incorporating 256 copies ( z 13 . 6 kb ) of a truncated lacO sequence , 23 kb from the centromere in cells expressing a GFP - labeled lac repressor ( lacI ) . This study showed that chromosomes in budding yeast oscillate from pole to pole Address correspondence to Chad G .

The 23 - kb marker was not separated before anaphase onset in appar - ent conflict with the distribution of the presumptive ki - netochore microtubules from EM analyses ( Peterson and Ris , 1976 ; Winey et al . , 1995 ; O’Toole et al . , 1999 ) . This is - sue remained unresolved until lacO arrays were integrated 1 . 8 – 3 . 8 kb from the centromere ( Goshima and Yanagida , 2000 ) . Unlike the 23 - kb marker , the centromere proximal markers were seen in fixed preparations to be separated # 0 . 8 m m before anaphase onset , indicating that the cen - tromere proximal sister chromatin is stretched apart ( Goshima and Yanagida , 2000 ) . Subsequently , live cell im - aging of cells with GFP markers on individual chromo - somes 1 . 4 – 2 kb from centromeres and at spindle pole bod - ies showed that separated sister centromeres oscillate relative to each other and to their poles before anaphase in a microtubule - and kinetochore - dependent manner ( He et al . , 2000 ; Tanaka et al . , 2000 ) . This dynamic stretching of centromere proximal chromatin reconciles the position of centromeres with EM studies . However , it raises new questions about the dynamic movements of centromeres , specifically during mitosis . We have used live cell imaging of GFP - labeled kineto - chores , chromosome loci , and spindle poles at higher tempo - ral resolution to address centromere alignment , oscillations , and poleward movement at anaphase and poleward chro - matin recoil at anaphase onset . To increase resolution , we have used a short 1 . 7 - kb lacO repeat to mark chromatin 1 . 1 , 12 . 7 , and 23 kb from the centromere of individual chromo - somes . The tandem repeat sequences used previously to measure chromosome movements and centromere proximal chromatin stretch were 5 . 6 – 13 . 6 kb in length ( Straight et al . , 1997 ; Goshima and Yanagida , 2000 ; He et al . , 2000 ; Tanaka et al . , 2000 ) . Thus , the actual position and movements of the centromeres may have been significantly underestimated . These changes , together with a sensitive imaging system , were used to detect the much weaker fluorescence of shorter lacO ( z 1 . 7 kb ) spots . To avoid conclusions based on observations of only one chromosome , we also marked cen - tromeres of all chromosomes using Cse4 – GFP , a kineto - chore protein ( Meluh et al . , 1998 ; Chen et al . , 2000 ) . In contrast to tissue cells , fluorescent marks on yeast chromosome arms have not been previously observed to congress to a metaphase plate ( Straight et al . , 1997 ) . This may reflect underlying differences in yeast versus other eukaryotic cells and is critical for evaluating the impor - tance and evolutionary significance of metaphase ( Nicklas and Arana , 1992 ) . However , Peterson and Ris’ studies ( 1976 ) indicate that the site of microtubule attachment to chromatin or centromere localization occurs within the medial portion of the spindle , and the ends of presumptive kinetochore microtubules are on average found within two bands on either side of the spindle equator close to the central spindle ( Peterson and Ris , 1976 ; Winey et al . , 1995 ; O’Toole et al . , 1999 ) . Our imaging of Cse4 - GFP – labeled centromeres shows that oscillations in position occur , but , on average , the separation between sister centromeres spans a large part of the central spindle , and the midpoint of the separated centromeres defines a metaphase plate . With respect to timing , it has not been clear when anaphase A starts relative to the onset of anaphase B and how fast centromeres move poleward , since the chromo - some arm markers do not accurately locate the position of the centromeres . Also , none of the previous studies using centromere proximal markers has addressed anaphase . Our experiments show that anaphase A begins synchro - nously for all centromeres at or within several minutes af - ter the onset of anaphase B . Finally , the centromere proxi - mal markers move poleward at z 0 . 33 m m / min . In contrast , chromosome disjunction of a marker 23 kb from the cen - tromere rapidly moves poleward , recoiling from stretching produced by poleward movement of centromeres and anaphase B separation of the spindle poles .

PCR Fragments for Integration Integration of the lac operator into defined chromosomal loci was per - formed using PCR - based methods with 50 bp of homology flanking each 5 9 and 3 9 primer to the plasmid pLKL60Y . pLKL60Y was constructed us - ing a BstEII – AccI fragment of an 8 mer of the lacO repeat ( Robinett et al . , 1996 ) . Four copies of this repeat were then cloned into SmaI of pFA6MX4 ( Wach et al . , 1994 ) to create a 32 mer ( 1 . 2 kb in length ) of the lac operator adjacent to the G418 resistance marker . The lacI – GFP fragment was synthesized from pLKL55Y and targeted for integration into LYS2 . pLKL55Y contains the lacI sequence , fused a nuclear localization signal ( NLS ) , S65T GFP , and the NAT1 r dominant drug resistance marker gene under the HIS3 promoter ( Robinett et al . , 1996 ) cloned into pRS303 ( Sikorski and Hieter , 1989 ) . A COOH - terminal fusion of SPC29 – cyan fluorescent protein ( CFP ) was synthesized from pDH5 ( Yeast Resource Center ) . Primers were con - structed by using 50 bp of homology one codon upstream of the SPC29 stop codon and one codon downstream of the SPC29 coding region to am - plify the CFP - G418 sequence . Yeast Strains and Media The S . cerevisiae strains and references or sources used in these experi - ments are listed in Tables I and II . Strains with stable integrations were maintained in YEPD ( 2 % glucose , 2 % peptone , and 1 % yeast extract ) . All strains requiring selection for maintenance of plasmids were grown on synthetic medium containing dextrose ( 0 . 67 % yeast nitrogen base , 2 % glucose , and the appropriate amino acids ) . To induce lacI - NLS - GFP , cells were resuspended in synthetic media lacking histidine for z 1 . 5 h at 30 8 C before adding 20 mM 3 - aminotriazole ( Sigma - Aldrich ) for z 30 min . All strains were grown to midlogarithmic phase growth before preparation for imaging . Imaging Techniques and equipment for GFP imaging have been previously de - scribed ( Shaw et al . , 1997 ; Maddox et al . , 2000 ) . For two - color imaging , excitation and emission of the fluorescent proteins was performed using the Chroma CFP – yellow fluorescent protein ( YFP ) narrow pass excita - tion and emission filters ( 86002 series ; Chroma Technology Corp . ) . The CFP signal was imaged using the CFP excitation filters , whereas GFP was imaged in the YFP channel using the YFP narrow pass filters . YFP filters were used to accurately separate the GFP and CFP emission signals with a loss in the efficiency of GFP detection . The centromere - specific histone ( Cse4p ) fused to GFP was used as a pan - specific marker for all centromeres ( Chen et al . , 2000 ) . Centromere proximal spots were labeled with a lacO spot ( Robinett et al . , 1996 ; Straight et al . , 1996 ) placed at z 1 . 1 kb from CEN11 ( centromere proximal spot ) . Chromosome arms were labeled z 12 . 7 kb from CEN11 and z 23 kb from CEN3 with lacO markers . To visualize the lacO elements , LacI – GFP was expressed under the control of the His3 promoter . This system facili - tated the dynamic analysis of particular domains along chromosomes . Spindle pole bodies and the mitotic spindle were labeled with GFP to pro - vide a reference point for the analysis of chromosome movement . Multi - ple spindle pole body markers ( Spc72 – GFP , Nuf2 – GFP , and Spc29 – GFP ) and GFP – Tub1 were used for these studies to ensure that alterations in spindle architecture by different fluorescent protein fusions did not influ - ence results . Nuf2p , reported as a spindle pole body protein ( Osborne et al . , 1994 ; Kahana et al . , 1995 ) , also localizes to the kinetochore , based on GFP fusion protein localization relative to fluorescently labeled spindle pole bodies ( data not shown ; Janke et al . , 2001 ; Wigge and Kilmartin , 2001 ) . However , in strains used in this study , we observed the predomi - nant Nuf2 – GFP localization to occur at the spindle pole bodies , based on localization relative to a lacO centromere proximal marker and distance measurements of the separated Nuf2 – GFP fluorescent spots ( data not shown ) . The predominant localization of Nuf2 – GFP and Spc72 – GFP at the spindle pole body allowed us to accurately measure the anaphase movements of centromere proximal spots relative to the spindle pole body during anaphase onset . Images were acquired at 0 . 7 – 60 - s intervals , depending on the experi - ment . Fast rate analysis ( 0 . 7 – 5 - s intervals ) and single plane acquisitions were used to measure the rate of preanaphase chromosome oscillations , the rapid spot separation rates at anaphase onset , and Cse4 – GFP move - ments . The single plane images had a depth of focus of z 1 m m . Therefore , a slightly tilted spindle may appear in focus , however , oscillation dis - tances and rates could be underestimated . Additionally , our measure - ments reflect a distance measurement from one spindle pole body to a chromosome spot . Chromosome rate measurements that are not along the spindle axis will also likely reflect an underestimate in movement rates . Time - lapse acquisition of optical Z - series of either three or five frames , separated by 0 . 75 m m steps , were used in all other imaging proce - dures . All images were acquired using 2 3 2 binning to increase camera signal - to - noise fourfold . However , preanaphase Cse4 – GFP images and anaphase Tub1 – GFP images were collected without binning for twofold - increased resolution . Rate and Distance Measurement Analysis All rate measurements were analyzed using the spindle pole body as a fi - ducial marker for chromosome movement along the spindle . Frame stacks were analyzed using the Metamorph Track Points function ( Universal Im - aging Corp . ) , and data sets were exported into Microsoft Excel™ for anal - ysis . To correct for random errors in tracking , each frame stack analysis was repeated three times , and the mean for all collected data points was recorded . The rate of chromosome movement was determined in se - quences where the length of the spindle did not change by a distance . 0 . 2 m m . Linear regression plots were drawn through directed movements of greater than four data points . The slope of each linear regression plot was used to determine the rate of movement , and the average for all observed directed movements was calculated . Half - spindle microtubules were measured by determining the distance from the spindle pole body to the outer edge of the half - spindle microtu - bules or tufts . Fluorescence intensity measurements on half - spindle micro - tubules were performed when the objective resolution ( z 250 – 300 nm ) limited the detection of half - spindle microtubule shortening . A 10 3 10 pixel region was placed over each half - spindle and the total integrated flu - orescence intensity was measured . The background , determined by plac - ing the same size region on a nonlabeled portion of the cell , was then sub - tracted from this value . This measurement was then standardized to the distance measurement of the last spindle pole body to the end of half - spin - dle measurement . Each decreasing intensity measurement , expressed as a decrease in distance from the spindle pole body , represented a loss in the total integrated fluorescence intensity for that particular half - spindle at the indicated time points . All measurements using Z - series acquisitions were performed using the Metamorph Measure Pixel function . In - focus data points were measured us - ing Cartesian coordinates . This allowed for manually calculated three - dimensional reconstructions to determine the localization of chromosome spot ( s ) or centromere spots , relative to the mitotic spindle . All collected data was exported into Microsoft Excel for analysis of rates and / or localization . Image Presentation Presentation images were prepared as previously described ( Shaw et al . , 1997 ; Maddox et al . , 2000 ) . Note that all analyses were performed using a manually calculated three - dimensional reconstruction with Cartesian co - ordinates . Kymographs were used to project all data points for an entire collected sequence of preanaphase movements at fast rate intervals . A re - gion 5 – 8 pixels wide was drawn through the long axis of the mitotic spin - dle , and the brightest pixel was recorded on a single line . This was re - peated for each time point and was displayed along the x axis to show the entire time course . Table II .

In live large budded cells before anaphase onset , centromeres labeled with Cse4 – GFP were often observed as two clusters or groups separated on av - erage by 0 . 58 6 0 . 36 m m ( minimum 5 0 m m , maximum 5 1 . 84 m m ; n 5 63 ) ( Fig . 1 A ; Table III ) . In contrast , average separation of the z 1 . 1 - kb centromere proximal spot was 0 . 26 6 0 . 32 m m ( min 5 0 m m , max 5 1 . 48 m m ; n 5 95 ) ( Fig . 1 B ; Table III ) . This is z 0 . 32 m m less separated than the average separation of the Cse4 – GFP centromere marker ( Fig . 1 , A and B ; Table III ) . Chromosome arms with lac operator repeats integrated more distal to the cen - tromere were on average separated by 0 . 07 6 0 . 19 m m ( min 5 0 m m , max 5 0 . 85 m m ; n 5 94 ) at loci z 12 . 7 - kb CEN11 and were observed as a single unseparated spot when integrated z 23 kb from CEN3 ( n 5 101 ) ( Fig . 1 , C and D ; Table III ) . The centromere separation and out - ward stretch of the arms near the centromeric region shown in Fig . 1 E is consistent with previous reports that centromeres are on average separated before anaphase onset by poleward forces ( Goshima and Yanagida , 2000 ; He et al . , 2000 ; Tanaka et al . , 2000 ) . To measure the dynamic movements of centromeres in preanaphase cells , we recorded the z 1 . 1 - kb centromere proximal marker movements relative to GFP - labeled spin - dle pole bodies using rapid frame acquisition rates ( z 1 frame / s ) ( Fig . 2 ) . Fig . 2 shows that , in addition to dynamic movements between the separated chromosome spots , there were also distinctive oscillations of the centromere proximal spots along the mitotic spindle with Spc72 – GFP - labeled spindle pole bodies . Two classes of centromere proximal spot movements are evident in Fig . 2 : major oscil - latory movements relative to the spindle pole body ( Fig . 2 C , directed oscillation ) and minor movements of , 0 . 25 m m that may be due to diffusional motion . Analyses were re - peated three times for each time - lapse sequence , and the mean was displayed , indicating that the smaller movements are not a product of tracking errors ( Fig . 2 C ) . The cen - tromere proximal markers separated # 1 . 26 m m ( Fig . 2 C , time point 5 70 . 3 s ) and reassociated with each other before reseparation ( Fig . 2 C , time point 5 199 . 0 s ) . There was no apparent strong coordination of the separated centromere spot oscillations relative to the spindle pole bodies , as deter - mined by the independent movement of each spot relative to its sister ( Fig . 2 C , directed oscillation ) . However , we did occasionally observe both separated spots to move toward a single pole in what appeared to be coordinated movements toward the spindle pole body ( data not shown ) . Figure 1 .

This is indicative of a metaphase - like conformation . Chromosome arms do not exhibit this phenotype as frequently . Optical Z - series were acquired for a population of cells . Using distance measurements with the Z - distance taken into account , the chromosome spot localization relative to the spindle was determined . For separated spots , the average distance relative to the spindle was used . on A p r il 10 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published March 19 , 2001 Pearson et al . Chromosome Dynamics in Budding Yeast 1259 To confirm the centromere oscillations observed using the z 1 . 1 - kb centromere proximal marker , we analyzed the movements of the pan - specific centromere marker Cse4 – GFP . Fig . 3 , A and B , describes two distinct groups of cen - tromeres at time point 145 s that separate into multiple spots , as observed with broader , less intense bands of fluo - rescence ( Fig . 3 A , time point 5 305 s , arrowheads ) , and then reassociate into two diffuse clusters or groups ( Fig . 3 A , time point 5 550 s ) . Transient Cse4 – GFP movements were observed between the clustered groups of fluores - cence ( Fig . 3 , arrowheads ) , indicating that centromeres ex - hibit dynamic movements relative to other centromeres in each clustered group . Furthermore , two - color imaging of Cse4 – GFP with CFP - labeled spindle pole bodies shows that the centromeres move relative to the spindle pole bodies ( data not shown ) . Velocity Calculations of the Preanaphase z 1 . 1 - kb CEN Proximal Spot Oscillations We have measured the rate of movement of centromere proximal spots relative to GFP - marked spindle pole bod - ies .

Centromeres but Not Chromosome Arms Exhibit a Metaphase Conformation We considered a metaphase conformation to exist if the midpoint of sister chromatids aligned within a medial 25 % of the mitotic spindle . To determine the average position of each chromosome marker along the spindle in a popula - tion of cells , we examined chromosome arm or centromere markers with GFP - labeled microtubules or spindle pole bodies . Z - series images of cell populations containing ei - ther Cse4 – GFP , z 1 . 1 - kb CEN11 , z 12 . 7 - kb CEN11 , or z 23 - kb CEN3 chromosome markers were collected in three separate experiments . The localization of markers in each cell was measured by determining the midpoint of the separated Cse4 – GFP sister clusters or the lacO – GFP spots relative to the spindle pole bodies . The midpoint of separated Cse4 – GFP foci were ob - served within the medial 25 % of the spindle in 83 % of the population of large budded cells ( n 5 63 ; Table III ) . The z 1 . 1 - kb CEN11 midpoint spot , z 12 . 7 - kb CEN11 , and z 23 - kb CEN3 spots were found to be within the medial 25 % of the spindle in 62 , 47 , and 36 % of the populations , respectively ( n 5 94 , 95 , and 101 , respec - tively ; Table III ) .

Temporal Resolution of Anaphase A Centromere Movement and Microtubule Shortening to the Spindle Pole Bodies Relative to Anaphase B Spindle Pole Body Separation To resolve the timing of anaphase A chromosome movement to the spindle pole body , we studied anaphase movements of GFP - marked chromosomes , centromeres , and spindle micro - tubules relative to anaphase B spindle elongation . The z 1 . 1 - kb CEN11 lacO marker was integrated into strains containing spindle pole bodies marked with Nuf2 – GFP or Spc72 – GFP . Z - series time - lapses were acquired at 15 – 45 s . We observed the z 1 . 1 - kb CEN11 proximal spots to move toward the GFP - marked spindle pole bodies coin - cident with or within 3 min after anaphase onset , as de - fined by the start of anaphase B spindle elongation ( Figs . 4 , A and B and 5 ) . Fig . 5 B ( arrow ) shows the separation of the spindle pole bodies to begin at the 0 . 0 - min time point . Movement of the CEN proximal spots toward the spindle pole body ensues at 1 . 0 min ( Fig . 5 B , arrow ) . This delay results in a transient increase in the distance between the centromere proximal spot and its spindle pole body . The centromere proximal spot began anaphase A chromosome movement toward the spindle pole body at an average spindle length of 2 . 87 6 0 . 51 m m ( Table IV ; n 5 15 ) . Re - gression lines were drawn through each plot of centromere proximal chromosome spot movement to the spindle pole Figure 4 .

Using GFP – Tub1 , we show that , upon elongation of the spindle , the fluores - cent tufts emanating from each spindle pole body , presumed to be kinetochore microtubules , shortened toward the spindle pole bodies . Plots also indicate that there were dynamic movements in the lengths of half - spindle microtubules emanating from the spindle pole body . When the half - spindle had shortened to within the resolution limit of the light microscope ( z 250 – 300 nm ) , integrated fluorescent intensities , standardized to the last distance measurement ( 6 . 26 min ) , were plotted to show that flu - orescence intensities decreased , indicating that microtubule polymer further decreased from the optical resolution limited tufts ( m ) .

The average rate observed was 0 . 33 6 0 . 16 m m / min ( Fig . 5 C ; Table IV ; n 5 23 ) . The average distance moved was 0 . 98 6 0 . 28 m m ( Table III ; n 5 23 ) . Cse4 – GFP and Spc29 – CFP facilitated the visualization of all centromeres relative to the spindle pole bodies . We found the centromere movement to the spindle pole body did not begin until anaphase B spindle pole body separa - tion ( Fig . 4 , C and D ) . Fig . 4 D describes the coincident in - cidence of anaphase A relative to anaphase B . At 3 min , spindle pole body separation and centromere movement to the spindle pole body began ( Fig . 4 D , arrow ) . We did not observe an increase in the distance between the spindle pole bodies and the Cse4 – GFP clusters , as observed for the CEN11 proximal marker ( Fig . 5 B ; data not shown ) . The delay observed between the start of anaphase B and anaphase A observed for the CEN11 proximal marker ( Fig . 5 B ) may be due to the timing of release of sister chromatid cohesion from the centromere proximal region . EM and fluorescent analysis of the mitotic spindle shows that two populations of microtubules emanate from the spindle pole bodies : 4 – 8 interpolar microtubules between the spindle pole bodies and 16 presumptive kinetochore microtubules , creating a half - spindle from each spindle pole body ( Winey et al . , 1995 ; O’Toole et al . , 1999 ; Maddox et al . , 2000 ) . Using GFP – Tub1 to analyze the behavior of the presumptive kinetochore microtubules , we measured shortening of the mitotic half - spindle as the length of the interpolar spindle increased during anaphase B . Fig . 4 E ( arrows ) shows images of fluorescent half - spindles or tufts emanating from the spindle pole body as they shortened af - ter anaphase B onset . The half - spindle distance was mea - sured until their length decreased to the resolution limit of the light microscope , z 250 – 300 nm ( Fig . 4 F , solid line ; to 6 . 26 min ) . Fluorescence intensity measurements , standard - ized to the 6 . 26 - min time point , were then determined for the remaining time points measured . The fluorescence in - tensity decreased , indicating a further loss in microtubule polymer within the resolution - limited half - spindles ( Fig . 4 F , dashed line ) . In addition to half - spindle shortening at the onset of anaphase B , Fig . 4 F shows several dynamic changes in the length of the half - spindles relative to their spindle pole bodies that may reflect either dynamic move - ments of clustered centromeres or slight changes in the fo - cal plane . Also , note that the half - spindle emanating from each spindle pole body only decreases in length after spin - dle pole body separation , indicating that anaphase A mi - crotubule shortening to the spindle pole body does not be - gin before anaphase B has initiated ( Fig . 4 F ) . Synchrony of Chromosome Separation at Anaphase Onset Analysis of the anaphase movements of centromeres la - beled with Cse4 – GFP indicated that the initiation of anaphase A movement toward the spindle pole body was synchronous . Distinct groups of fluorescence , presumed to be a cluster of the 16 sister pairs , were observed to undergo anaphase A movements toward the spindle pole body with very few centromeres moving distinct from each discrete cluster of centromeres ( Fig . 4 C ) . This is consistent with our observations that z 1 . 1 - kb centromere proximal spots on two different chromosomes in the same cell separated synchronously during anaphase onset ( data not shown ) . Chromatin Stretching Occurs between the Centromere and the Centromere Proximal Spot upon Anaphase B Spindle Pole Body Separation Upon anaphase B spindle elongation , we often observed ( 12 / 13 measured ) the distance between the spindle pole bodies and their respective centromere proximal spot to increase before undergoing anaphase A shortening to the spindle pole body ( Fig . 5 B , 0 . 0 – 1 . 0 min ) . This length in - Figure 5 . Centromere proximal ( z 1 . 1 kb ) marker movement to the spindle pole body during anaphase A .

Chromosome Dynamics in Budding Yeast 1263 crease was due to either the lengthening of the microtu - bules attached to chromosomes , stretching of the kineto - chore , and / or stretching of the chromatin between the centromere and the z 1 . 1 - kb CEN11 marker . The distance between the Cse4 – GFP cluster and the spindle pole body did not increase upon spindle pole body separation , nor did the half - spindle length measured , using GFP – Tub1 ( Figs . 4 , C – F ; data not shown ) . This indicates that the in - creased distance between the spindle pole body and the z 1 . 1 – kb CEN11 spot is likely due to further stretch in the chromatin between the centromere and the lacO marker . Rapid Poleward Recoil of Chromosomal DNA upon Anaphase B Spindle Pole Body Separation The above analyses indicate that chromatin surrounding the centromere is stretched and therefore predict that re - lease of cohesions should result in poleward chromatin recoil . To test this prediction , lacO markers , labeling chromosomes at z 1 . 1 or z 23 kb from their respective centromeres , were imaged using single plane and , 1 - s ac - quisition intervals without spindle pole body markers to determine their behavior and rate of separation upon anaphase onset . Chromosome separation rates similar to those observed for biphasic spindle elongation rates pre - viously characterized ( Kahana et al . , 1995 ; Yeh et al . , 1995 ; Straight et al . , 1998 ) would be expected if the chro - mosomes passively followed the separating spindle pole bodies . Anaphase A movements also contribute to the rate of early chromatid separation ( Figs . 4 and 5 ) . There - fore , the rate of spot separation would be expected to be the sum of spindle pole body separation in early anaphase ( z 1 m m / min ) ( Kahana et al . , 1995 ; Yeh et al . , 1995 ; Straight et al . , 1998 ) and anaphase A rates for both spots moving to their respective spindle pole bodies ( 1 . 66 m m / min ; Table IV ) . The centromere proximal spot was generally observed to separate at rates slightly greater than those observed for fast anaphase B spindle pole body separation . This is con - sistent with anaphase A and B movements being responsi - ble for the rates of sister centromere separation ( 1 . 21 6 0 . 46 m m / min ; Table V ) . However , infrequently ( 3 / 16 ob - served ; Table V ) , the initial rate of separation was ob - served to be much greater than that expected for the sepa - ration of sister chromatids ( see above ) . Fig . 6 A shows initial separation of the z 1 . 1 - kb centromere proximal spots with a short rapid separation ( arrow ) . These rates were 2 . 73 – 9 . 67 m m / min ( average 5 5 . 22 6 3 . 87 m m / min ; Table V , initial separation ) for a distance of 1 . 16 6 0 . 22 m m ( Table V ) . Although there was some evidence for chromatin recoil at the centromere proximal marker , it is not a frequent event with a significant contribution to chromosome poleward movement . In time - lapse sequences for the z 23 - kb CEN3 chromo - some arm marker , all observations ( 7 / 7 observed ; Table V ) of the initial separation of sister chromatids showed a rapid initial separation of sister chromosome arm markers at an average separation rate of 10 . 48 6 6 . 38 m m / min ( n 5 7 ; Table V ) for an average distance of 1 . 26 6 0 . 28 m m ( Fig . 6 B , arrow ; Table V ) . Although there was a large variabil - ity in the rates of separation , 5 . 12 – 21 . 77 m m / min , the z 23 - kb CEN3 lacO chromosome arm spot was observed to consistently separate at rapid rates . Poleward recoil of the z 23 - kb lacO spot indicates that stretch of the chromatin z 23 kb from the centromere makes a significant contribu - tion to the kinetics of chromosome arm movement .

Tension across the centromere results in separation of the sister centromeres and proximal chromatin before the on - set of anaphase . Centromere - specific proteins labeled with GFP , such as Cse4p ( Cse4 – GFP ) , show that the separation between sister centromeres spans a large part of the spin - dle and the midpoint of the separated centromere clus - ters preferentially localizes to the spindle equator in a metaphase - like conformation ( Figs . 1 E and 7 ) . This pre - anaphase separation of sister centromeres is likely impor - tant for the maintenance of bipolar chromosome attach - ment and the functional processes of properly segregating the duplicated genome . Similar stretching in centromere chromatin has been observed in human tissue culture cells ( Shelby et al . , 1996 ) and in the diatoms ( Pickett - Heaps and Tippit , 1978 ; Tippit et al . , 1980 ) . The kinetochore mi - crotubule attachment in meiotic grasshopper spermato - cytes is stabilized with tension ( Nicklas and Koch , 1969 ) , and the direction of chromosome motility is also sensitive to tension ( Nicklas , 1977 ; Inoue and Salmon , 1995 ; Skibbens et al . , 1995 ) . Additionally , tension in higher eu - karyotes has roles in regulating the cell cycle progression from metaphase to anaphase ( McIntosh , 1991 ; Nicklas , 1997 ; Rieder and Salmon , 1998 ) . Our observation of clustered centromeres based on Cse4 – GFP localization allowed us to corroborate in vivo the mitotic spindle structure previously proposed based on EM studies ( Peterson and Ris , 1976 ; Winey et al . , 1995 ; O’Toole et al . , 1999 ) . The spindle structure based on EM work shows kinetochore microtubules to be localized in a parallel structure contradictory to the splayed mitotic structure seen in higher eukaryotes . Centromere - linked lacO spots integrated at various loci along chromosome arms were clearly off the spindle axis ; however , this is likely because these markers do not represent the actual localization of the centromeres . Therefore , localization of clustered centromeres between the spindle pole bodies us - ing Cse4 – GFP leads us to postulate that the kinetochore microtubule arrays are organized in parallel arrays consis - tent with EM data . This view of the budding yeast spindle organization is not consistent with the splayed mitotic spindle proposed by He et al . ( 2000 ) . The large difference in the average separation of the z 1 . 1 - kb CEN11 chromosome marker and Cse4 – GFP foci indicates that the z 1 . 1 kb of DNA between these markers is highly elongated by an average distance of 0 . 16 or 0 . 15 m m / kb of DNA ( Fig . 1 ; Table III ) before the onset of anaphase . Naked B form DNA is 0 . 34 m m / kb , and a seven - fold nucleosomal compaction predicts that 1 kb of mitotic chromatin covers a distance of 0 . 05 m m ( Finch et al . , 1977 ) . Our results predict that the level of DNA compaction at the centromere and surrounding chromatin in large budded cells is threefold less than nucleosomal DNA . Upon anaphase onset , this stretching of DNA is further amplified due to large forces generated by the elongating central spindle . Functionally , this centromeric DNA conformation may be indicative of an active structure that can be dynam - ically stretched and is responsible for proper centromere function . Importantly , our lacO sequence is 1 . 7 kb in length , and it has been shown that lacO sequences can be stretched by forces generated from the mitotic spindle ( He et al . , 2000 ) . Therefore , the measured spot for the z 1 . 1 - kb CEN11 lacO marker may represent a distance greater than the z 1 . 1 - kb ( * 2 . 8 kb ) distance from the centromere , be - cause portions of the lacO array are stretched toward the spindle pole bodies . Centromeres undergo oscillatory movements relative to each other and to the spindle pole bodies , as shown for vertebrate kinetochores in tissue cells ( Skibbens et al . , 1993 ; Rieder and Salmon , 1994 , 1998 ) . The microtu - bule - and kinetochore - dependent separation of sister cen - tromeres in S . cerevisiae ( Goshima and Yanagida , 2000 ; He et al . , 2000 ; Tanaka et al . , 2000 ) before anaphase onset indicates that the functions involved at the interface be - Figure 7 . Model of chromosome oscillations , alignment , and segregation . on A p r il 10 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published March 19 , 2001 Pearson et al . Chromosome Dynamics in Budding Yeast 1265 tween the microtubule and kinetochore are important for chromosome dynamics in mitosis . Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching studies of the mitotic half - spindle also show that microtubule dynamics are evident before the onset of anaphase ( Maddox et al . , 2000 ) . We show that these half - spindle microtubules shorten upon anaphase B spindle pole body separation , as would be expected for ki - netochore microtubule shortening during anaphase A ( Figs . 4 E and 7 ) . Interestingly , the rate of chromosome movement we observed before the onset of anaphase ( see Results ) is similar to the in vivo growth and shortening rates of wild - type astral microtubule plus ends ( Tirnauer et al . , 1999 ) . Capped microtubule minus ends shown by EM studies in yeast provide evidence that microtubule mi - nus ends may be stable , whereas the flared microtubule plus ends may be dynamic ( O’Toole et al . , 1999 ) . These re - sults lead us to further postulate that the minus end mi - crotubule dynamics of kinetochore microtubules or tread - milling may have little involvement in chromosome movements , whereas plus end dynamics at the kinetochore are important in budding yeast ( Maddox et al . , 2000 ) . The duration and frequency of yeast sister centromere movements relative to each other is important to the mechanism for how a chromosome maintains a bipolar at - tachment to the mitotic spindle and may also be important for why sister centromeres separate and reassociate before the onset of anaphase . Fig . 2 provides an example of sister centromere rejoining and separation . During these se - quences , we observed centromere proximal spots to reas - sociate for only 0 . 4 % , or 19 . 5 s , of the entire imaging time ( 25 . 5 min ) , beginning with separated sister centromeres . These reassociations were observed in only two of eight time - lapse sequences , indicating that once centromeres have separated , they infrequently reassociate . Consistent with He et al . ( 2000 ) , we did not observe the centromere proximal spots to remain separated for longer than 8 min before rejoining , however our low sample time may have been limiting to these analyses . The rejoining of sister cen - tromere proximal spots may be due to unstable attach - ments of sister kinetochores to kinetochore microtubules , thereby collapsing the separated lacO spots . However , be - cause we do not observe rapid inward recoil of separated spots , it is more likely that the rejoining of centromere proximal spots is due to directional instability of kineto - chore microtubules ( Skibbens et al . , 1993 ) . This behav - ior may be analogous to the tension - dependent regula - tory mechanism in higher eukaryotes , where coordinated movements between sister kinetochores regulates the di - rection of chromosome movement essential for congres - sion to a metaphase plate ( Skibbens et al . , 1993 , 1995 ) . In large budded cells , centromeres , and not the chromo - some arms , adopt a metaphase - like conformation . The Cse4 – GFP localization ( Table III ) persists within the me - dial 25 % of the mitotic spindle , whereas chromosome arms do not . This centromere configuration is similar to tissue cell kinetochores that are separated and aligned at the spindle equator during metaphase ( Skibbens et al . , 1993 , 1995 ; Khodjakov and Rieder , 1996 ; Waters et al . , 1996 , 1998 ) . Our metaphase observation is consistent with Peterson and Ris ( 1976 ) original EM observation that there is a metaphase plate that separates into two “ana - phase plates” upon anaphase onset . A single metaphase plate , rather than two separated clusters surrounding the spindle equator , may have been observed in their studies because chromatin proximal to the centromere was likely detectable in a single thick EM image plane between the separated centromeres . More recent EM studies show a population of shorter kinetochore microtubules found to be of approximately the same length , consistent with a metaphase alignment of chromosomes ( O’Toole et al . , 1999 ) . Chromosome congression to a metaphase - like con - formation is believed to have evolved with the spindle as - sembly checkpoint ( Nicklas and Arana , 1992 ) . Although some organisms do not contain a metaphase plate ( Kubai , 1975 ) , this conformation may have significant importance to the physical processes of segregating DNA in an orga - nized and regulated manner . The greatest physical evidence for tension - dependent chromatin stretching and elastic recoil during mitosis is ap - parent upon anaphase onset , when chromatin snaps to - ward the separating spindle pole body at rates much greater than exhibited by centromeres during anaphase A and B movements . A previous report indicated that a marker z 23 kb from CEN3 separated by 1 . 8 m m in the 26 - s interval observed , predicting a rapid separation rate of 3 . 6 m m / min ( Straight et al . , 1997 ) . Using rapid image ac - quisition , we were able to obtain velocity measurements of these fast chromosome separation rates . Upon anaphase onset , spindle elongation and centromere movement to the spindle pole body began coincidentally and was fol - lowed by further stretching of the chromatin linking sister centromeres ( Figs . 5 B and 7 ) . This increase in distance from the spindle pole body is not evident in the GFP – Tub1 or Cse4 – GFP analyses , indicating that the stretching occurs between the centromere and the chromosome markers . This stretching is presumably before the release of cohesion , since chromosome arms have not segregated ( Fig . 7 ) . Loss of cohesion creates a release of tension in the chromatin stretched between sister centromeres and causes chromosome arms to undergo a rapid elastic recoil toward the spindle pole body ( Fig . 7 ) . Because markers closer to the centromere segregate earlier than telomere proximal markers ( Straight et al . , 1997 ) , the simplest model for the elastic recoil is a “zippering” effect that re - sults in a progressive separation and recoil of the DNA to - ward the spindle pole bodies ( Fig . 7 ) . Interestingly , the rate of spindle elongation ( labeled with Spc29 – GFP , GFP – Tub1 , Spc72 – GFP , or Nuf2 – GFP ) did not exhibit rapid transient movements distinguishable from the normal rates of spindle elongation . This indicates that the polar forces involved in maintaining the proper spindle length during anaphase B spindle pole body separation are much greater than the forces provided by stretched chromo - somes . The ability for stretched DNA to recoil in vivo is analogous to a histone - dependent folding mechanism where stretched nucleosomal DNA is placed under ten - sion and then undergoes a reversible repacking ( Cui and Bustamante , 2000 ; Poirier et al . , 2000 ) . Centromere - specific and spindle pole body fluorescent probes used in combination with sensitive high temporal resolution imaging techniques allowed us to characterize the structural and dynamic features of chromosome move - ments during metaphase and anaphase in S . cerevisiae . The major features of these movements are similar to mi - on A p r il 10 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published March 19 , 2001 The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 152 , 2001 1266 totic chromosome movements in mammalian tissue cells making budding yeast a useful tool to study the fundamen - tal molecular mechanisms that produce and regulate chro - mosome motility and segregation .
