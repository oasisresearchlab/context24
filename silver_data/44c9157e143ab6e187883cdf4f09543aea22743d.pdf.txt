However , the exact neural processes underlying creative problem solving remain unclear . Insightful problem solving tasks were shown to be a valid method for investigating one subcomponent of creativity : the Aha ! - moment . Finding insightful solutions during a remote associ - ates task ( RAT ) was found to elicit specific cortical activity changes . Considering the strong affective components of Aha ! - moments , as manifested in the subjectively experienced feeling of relief following the sudden emergence of the solution of the problem without any conscious fore - warning , we hypothesized the subcortical dopaminergic reward network to be critically engaged during Aha . To investigate those subcortical contributions to insight , we employed ultra - high - field 7 T fMRI during a German Version of the RAT . During this task , subjects were exposed to word triplets and instructed to find a solution word being associated with all the three given words . They were supposed to press a button as soon as they felt confident about their solution without further revision , allowing us to capture the exact event of Aha ! - moment . Besides the finding on cortical involvement of the left anterior middle temporal gyrus ( aMTG ) , here we showed for the first time robust subcortical activity changes related to insightful problem solving in the bilateral thalamus , hippocampus , and the dopaminergic midbrain comprising ventral tegmental area ( VTA ) , nucleus accumbens ( NAcc ) , and caudate nucleus . These results shed new light on the affective neural mechanisms underlying insightful problem solving .

This process often occurs with a unique phenomenal experience , the Aha ! - moment , referring to the moment of transition from being completely dark about the solution to suddenly “ seeing ” it . This phenomenological experience brings a sense of ease , is intrinsically pleasurable , and accompanied by a feeling of certainty about the solution ( Shen , Yuan , Liu , & Luo , 2016 ; Topolinski & Reber , 2010 ) . One of the first anecdotal evidence of Aha ! or Eureka ! - moment was associ - ated with Archimedes , a leading scientist in classical antiquity , who had leapt from his bath and shouted “ Eureka ! ( Greek meaning , “ I have found it ” ) when he suddenly ( from his perspective ) found out a brilliant solu - tion to a difficult problem ( Biello , 2006 ) . Since that time , many scien - tists were described to have this experience as source for their groundbreaking ideas , among them Carl Friedrich Gauss , Albert Einstein , and Sir Alec Jeffreys . Due to its mystical phenomenology , 20th century psychologists started to get to the bottom of this Martin Tik and Ronald Sladky contributed equally to this manuscript . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Since then insightful problem solving has been associ - ated with many different cognitive and affective processes as memory , enforcement learning , and emotion ( Kizilirmak , Thuerich , Folta - Schoofs , Schott , & Richardson - Klavehn , 2016a ; Milivojevic , Vicente - Grabovetsky , & Doeller , 2015 ; Shen et al . , 2016 ; Webb , Little , & Crop - per , 2017 ) . Despite the importance of the Aha ! - experience in obtaining creative and insightful solutions and the large corpus of behavioral evi - dence , imaging studies on the brain mechanisms involved in this phe - nomenon just emerged recently . A few fMRI and EEG studies exist on insight , reporting cortical areas that include parts of the temporal lobes , especially the superior temporal gyrus , and parts of the prefrontal cortex ( Dietrich & Kanso , 2010 ; Jung - Beeman et al . , 2004 ) . These results indicate higher order cognitive processes as task monitoring and ( semantic ) retrieval to be at the core of Aha ! - experience , which is in line with psychological models on insight ( Knoblich , Ohlsson , & Raney , 2001 ; MacGregor , Ormerod , & Chronicle , 2001 ) . However , given the fact that the Aha ! - experience is usually associated with an affective state best described in parallel to reward processing ( Canestrari , Bianchi , Branchini , Burro , & Savardi , 2017 ) , dopaminergic midbrain and associated brain structures are expected to be involved in this phenomenon as well . Subtle activation changes , not exceeding strict statistical thresholds , were reported in subcortical areas such as bilateral hippocampi , parahippocampal gyri , and anterior and posterior cingulate cortex ( Subramaniam , Kounios , Parrish , & Jung - Beeman , 2009 ; Zhao et al . , 2013 ) . Furthermore , in a recent study , Kizilirmak et al . ( 2016a ) found left hippocampal and para - hippocampal activation during insight , though not surviving a strict threshold , and a significant activation in the anterior cingulate cortex ( ACC ) . Additionally , event - related potentials indicate that the ACC as well as the parahippocampal gyrus are involved in insightful problem solving ( Mai , Luo , Wu , & Luo , 2004 ; Qiu & Zhang , 2008 ) . Taking into account a strong affective and learning component as part of the insight experience ( Cranford & Moss , 2012 ; Metcalfe , 1986a , 1986b ) and the newly drawn link between creativity and dopa - minergic activity ( Chermahini & Hommel , 2010 ; Flaherty , 2005 ; Kuli - sevsky , Pagonabarraga , & Martinez - Corral , 2009 ; Lhommee et al . , 2014 ; Salvi , Bricolo , Franconeri , Kounios , & Beeman , 2015 ; Schwingen - schuh , Katschnig , Saurugg , Ott , & Bhatia , 2010 ; Zabelina , Colzato , Bee - man , & Hommel , 2016 ) , raises the question if the influence of subcortical areas during insight processing was underestimated so far . This assumption becomes even clearer considering the results of a comprehensive psychological study , where the participants had to freely describe their emotional states associated with insight ( Shen et al . , 2016 ) , and the three main emotions identified with an Aha - moment are happy , ease , and certainty . 3 Tesla fMRI studies on cortical underpinnings of insight and EEG studies to capture short - lived phe - nomena associated with Aha ! focused on cognitive components and led to illuminating insights . However , the neural underpinnings of the aforementioned affective component of the Aha ! - moment remains to be unraveled . Therefore , fast high - resolution imaging techniques in combinations with elaborated insightful problem solving tasks are needed to answer some of the remaining questions on insightful prob - lem solving tackled in this study . The compound word RAT was used and validated in previous neu - roimaging studies as an appropriate instrument to measure insight problem solving ( Jung - Beeman et al . , 2004 ; Sandkuhler & Bhattacharya , 2008 ) . The goal of compound word remote associates tasks is to find a word that makes three compound words with three given stimulus words . The participants in our study were instructed to answer promptly as soon as they feel confident about their solution , without making a strong revision of the found answer , which allows defining the very moment of the subject experiencing an insight or Aha ! Here we investigated insightful problem solving using fMRI at , for the first time , ultra - high magnetic field ( 7 T ) . We applied an optimized acquisition protocol allowing for high spatial resolution required to reveal BOLD signal changes in subcortical structures during insight . More specifically , we employed the RAT at 7 T to acquire functional brain images with high spatial resolution ( voxel size 5 1 . 5 3 1 . 5 3 1 mm 3 ) to adequately image subcortical regions , such as the nucleus accumbens , hippocampus , and the dopaminergic midbrain . Thereby we assessed activation in areas involved in the phenomenological aspects of positive effect , the feeling of certainty about a solution found with insight , and the formation of new memories and associations . 2 | PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS 2 . 1 | Study population Thirty healthy volunteers were recruited for participation in the fMRI study from the general public via flyers and online platforms . One sub - ject ( male ) had to be excluded after data acquisition due to noncompli - ance with task instructions , resulting in a final sample of 29 subjects ( 15f / 14m , age mean 6 standard deviation [ min , max ] : 27 . 7 6 3 . 7 [ 21 , 38 ] years ) . Standard fMRI exclusion criteria were applied that included neurological or psychiatric abnormalities , claustrophobia , use or abuse of psychotropic substances , the presence of metallic objects on or inside the body that could not be removed before the measurement , implants such as pacemakers , and pregnancy . They were furthermore checked for nonverbal reasoning as a proxy for general intelligence using the adaptive matrices test ( Hornke , Etzel , & Rettig , 2003 ) . This test revealed a mean performance of 88 % ( SD 5 12 % ) correctly solved trials in our sample , indicating normal to above average general intelli - gence in these participants . 2 . 2 | fMRI task The remote associates test ( RAT ) was shown to be one of the most promising experimental setups to investigate insightful problem solving . In this task , the subject is presented with a sequence of three words ( e . g . , HOUSE – BARK – APPLE ) and instructed to find a fourth word to form an associated compound noun ( e . g . , TREE ) . The methodological benefit of this task is that it encompasses a divergent thinking and a convergent thinking task component . Although in the creativity litera - ture the RAT is usually associated with convergent thinking , successful RAT solution requires both divergent and convergent thinking ( Kout - staal & Binks , 2015 ) . To obtain the solution word , we often have to suppress those words that are closely associated with the presented 2 | TIK ET AL . words , and instead , search for the word that is remotely associated , thereby requiring a break from our habitual mode of thinking , a key cri - terion for divergent thinking . Divergent thinking is required as the most salient solution candidates ( i . e . , those with the closest associations ) are supposed to be incorrect to fully qualify as a proper insight solution . However , the RAT solutions are usually unambiguous and , once uncov - ered , easily reportable , which is ideal for controlled experiments ( Die - trich & Kanso , 2010 ; Salvi et al . , 2015 ) . Finding the solution is therefore the convergence towards a definite goal . For this study , a German version of the RAT has been developed and implemented in Python 2 . 7 using pyglet as graphical front end . The flow chart of an experimental trial is shown in Figure 1 . Each trial con - sisted of the following phases : ( a ) PRE : crosshair at the beginning dis - played for 5 s . ( b ) TASK : word triplet and a series of underscore characters ( i . e . , “ _ ” ) to indicate the length of the correct solution pre - sented for a maximum duration of 20 s . A button press allowed the subject to report that they found a solution . On button press , a cross - hair was shown for 5 . 0 s . ( c ) HINT : if the subject did not press a button during the 20 s TASK period , the first letter of the solution was revealed as a hint . The maximum length of this phase was 10 s . ( 4 ) PROMPT : if the subject did not respond in time , the correct solution was presented for 5 s and the subject had to indicate if they under - stood the solution or not . ( 5 ) CHOICE : if the subject pressed a button during TASK or HINT , they were asked to verify their solution . ( 6 ) RAT - ING : at the end of each trial the subject was asked to rate their subjec - tive experience during the trial . On a discrete scale from 0 to 5 , they indicated the amount of insight and impasse they experienced during the task . ( 7 ) POST : crosshair at the end to ensure a total length of each trial sums up to 60 s . Participants attempted to solve 48 RAT items ( randomly selected from the 135 German RAT items ) inside the MRI scanner . These items were subdivided into 4 runs ( 12 RAT items per run ) . For both CHOICE and RATING periods , the subject reacted nonverbally . Solution verification and the amount of insight / impasse were done via a button press on a 4 - key keypad . To verify the right solution during CHOICE , we asked for the last letter of the solution word , that is , 3 letters were presented with an additional option for [ other ] . The subjects had to press the corresponding button on the controller . For the RATING scales ( insight / impasse ) , a 6 - point Likert - like scale was shown and button 1 ( 1 ) and 2 ( 2 ) were used to set the amount . Considering that the list of validated compound word RAT was pub - lished in English , we developed a German version of the task , by translat - ing the version adapted by Sandkuhler and Bhattacharya ( 2008 ) into German . Although there are other recent German translations of the RAT available ( Kizilirmak , Wiegmann , & Richardson - Klavehn , 2016b ; Land - mann et al . , 2014 ) , no validated tasks were available when we setup the study . Moreover , developing our own translation accounts for some cul - tural semantic differences between German Standard German and Aus - trian Standard German . Translating the task into German was an important step , as the test population consisted exclusively of German native - speakers . To evaluate the translated items before they could be used in the fMRI experiment , one native German speaker assessed these items for strange or uncommon items . Subsequently , a sample of five native German speakers who did not participate in the subsequent fMRI study attempted to solve the items . Based on their evaluation , 135 trans - lated items were chosen . In order to validate if this German version evoked a balanced amount of insight ratings we additionally administered an online version of the paradigm to an additional sample of 163 subjects . Analogous to the English version of the compound word RAT , the Ger - man version was supposed to consist of items with varying degrees of difficulty . Also , it should provide items that could be solved either analyti - cally or with a sudden insight . Those two premises were essential to col - lect control trials for fMRI data analysis and they are demonstrated in the results session . Importantly , the varying degree of difficulty for different items allowed us to collect a number of trials that could be solved with or without hint or were too hard to be solved . Measurements were performed on a MAGNETOM 7T whole - body MR scanner ( Siemens , Erlangen , DE ) at the MR Centre of Excellence , Medical University of Vienna , Austria . For data acquisition a 32 - channel head coil was used with the CMRR multiband EPI sequence ( Moeller et al . , 2010 ) . The sequence parameters to acquire 508 vol - umes for each of the four sessions were as follows : repetition time TR 5 1 . 4 s , echo time TE 5 23 ms , flip angle a5 62 8 , 78 slices with a spatial resolution of 1 . 5 3 1 . 5 3 1 mm 3 ( slice gap 0 . 25 mm ) . Note that using such small voxels sizes increases fMRI sensitivity in ventral brain areas as signal losses from intravoxel dephasing effects due to the FIGURE 1 Flow chart of an RAT trial . Each trial consists of 6 phases , with fixed and variable durations . A schematic representation of the response box that was used during the experiments indicates the possibility of button presses to report a solution ( during TASK or HINT ) , to select one of the presented options ( PROMPT , CHOICE ) , and to provide a subjective rating on a discrete scale ( RATING ) [ Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary . com ] TIK ET AL . | 3 presence of field inhomogeneity are strongly reduced ( Robinson , Wind - ischberger , Rauscher , & Moser , 2004 ; Windischberger , Robinson , Rauscher , Barth , & Moser , 2004 ) . Stimuli were shown on a screen mounted at the scanner bore via a video projector . A mirror was used to allow subjects to view the stimuli while lying comfortably inside the MR scanner . Feedback from the subject ( i . e . , responding to a given task ) was recorded by the use of an MR compatible response box ( Cur - rent Designs , Philadelphia , PA ) . All subjects were financially reimbursed for their participation and provided informed written consent . The study protocol was approved by the institutional review board of the Medical University of Vienna . The study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Hel - sinki ( 1964 ) , including current revisions . 2 . 3 | Preprocessing and general linear model ( GLM ) analysis of fMRI data Data were slice - timing corrected ( FSL ) ( Sladky et al . , 2011 ) , bias - field cor - rected ( ANTs ) ( Avants et al . , 2011 ) , realigned ( FSL ) , normalized ( ANTs ) , and spatially smoothed with a 3 mm FWHM Gaussian kernel ( FSL ) using a custom preprocessing pipeline to focus on small subcortical structures . Data analyses were performed in SPM12 . For single - subject ( first level ) analysis , linear regression was performed at each voxel , using generalized least squares with a global approximate AR ( 1 ) autocorrelation model , drift fit with Discrete Cosine Transform basis ( 128 s cutoff ) . Single - subject GLM analyses were conducted for all four sessions and included boxcar functions to model longer task periods ( i . e . , UNSOLVED TASK , SOLVED TASK with or without insight and with or without hint , HINT , CHOICE , PROMPT , RATING ) and stick functions for events ( i . e . , EVENT of found solution with high or low insight and a time - out event for UNSOLVED ) . As criterion for an item solved with high insight versus low insight , we calculated mean splits for each run per sub - ject and accounted insights above individual means as solved with insight and trials solved below mean as solved without insight . This way we guaranteed a balanced amount of trials per condition and accounted for inter - and intraindividual differences , for example , learning effects and dif - ferent concepts on scoring on a Likert scale ( Csikszentmihalyi & Larson , 2014 ) over the course of the experiment . Both types of regressors were convolved with SPM ’ s canonical HRF . Additionally , realignment parame - ter estimates were added as nuisance regressors to model movement - related variance not accounted for during preprocessing . Resulting contrast maps from single - subject GLM analyses were used for group analysis as implemented in SPM12 , that is , linear regres - sion was performed at each voxel , using generalized least squares with a global repeated measures correlation model . To map brain - activation during single task conditions , we calcu - lated t maps with a threshold of p < . 05 with whole - brain FWE correc - tion ( Figure 2 High Insight , Low Insight ) . To detect differences between conditions ( Figure 2 High Insight > Low Insight , Figure 3 Solved > Not Solved ) we calculated t statistics p < . 05 cluster - wise FWE correction with an initial cluster defining threshold of p < . 001 . For anatomical labeling of activation patterns , we used the TT _ Dae - mon atlas in AFNI ( whereami function ) . To perform region of interest analysis , we used marsbar ( Brett , Anton , Valabregue , & Poline , 2002 ) to extract mean beta values from bilateral NAcc , hippocampus , and VTA separately for solved with insight , solved without insight and unsolved tri - als . Post - hoc t tests on ROI results were calculated using MATLAB . 2 . 4 | Dynamic causal modeling ( DCM ) Dynamic causal modeling ( DCM ) is a well - established model selection procedure ( Friston , Harrison , & Penny , 2003 ) that is used to identify opti - mal causal models from an a priori defined model space within a fully Bayesian framework . DCM12 ( SPM12 , build 7134 ) was used for effective connectivity analysis . Motivated by our findings for task and event condi - tion , detrended time courses of the left DLPFC , NAcc , posterior Hipp , and SN / VTA ( anatomical masks that were also used in the VOI analysis ) were extracted for each participant using SPM ’ s volume of interest ( VOI ) extraction batch script based on a single - subject significance threshold p < . 05 ( first eigenvariate used as summary statistic , adjusted for effect of interest ) . In all models , the RAT task blocks were used as driving input for the DLPFC . Bidirectional connections between DLPFC , hippocampus ( Hipp ) , nucleus accumbens ( NAcc ) , and ventral tegmental area ( VTA ) were modeled . Given that there is no clear a priori assumption on the effective connectivity between the VOIs , we created a model space that comprised permutations of all possible bidirectional connections between these regions , that is , 2 2 * 3 5 64 different models . On all con - nections , the events for solution with high insight , solution with low insight , and no solution were modeled as modulators to assess how these conditions alter the effective connectivity . This model space was the basis for a random effects Bayesian model averaging ( BMA ) to determine a group average of the connectivity parameter estimates . 3 | RESULTS 3 . 1 | Behavioral data We intended to design a task with a set of compound remote associate problems where , on average , about half of the problems would be solved . As shown in Supporting Information , Table S1 , we succeeded to create a translation comparable to ( Sandkuhler & Bhattacharya , 2008 ) , with problems that were easy , medium , and hard to solve as tested on an independent sample outside the scanner . This was transferable on inside scanner behavioral data ( Support - ing Information , Table S2 ) where on average , participants proposed sol - utions for 58 % ( SD : 49 % ) of the 48 trials . Out of these answered trials , 71 % were correct . The first run evoked average insight ratings of 2 . 61 ( SD 5 1 . 42 ) , the second run 2 . 72 ( SD 5 1 . 39 ) , the third run 2 . 87 ( SD 5 1 . 35 ) , and the fourth 3 . 02 ( SD 5 1 . 42 ) . There was no significant correlation between run and insight rating ( two - tailed rho 5 . 179 , p 5 . 054 ) , indicating no significant training effect . A detailed overview of mean insight rating per run and subject is depicted in Supporting Information , Table S 3 . Behavioral data outside the scanner revealed a mean probability of solving items of 53 % ( SD 5 23 % , min 5 8 % , max 5 96 % ) . 74 % of the items were solved correctly , that is , by the predefined solution , and 4 | TIK ET AL . 26 % were solved with an alternative solution . Out of correctly solved items subjects showed a mean insight rating of 1 . 85 ( SD 5 . 60 , min 5 0 , max 5 4 ) , where 0 means no insight and 5 means highest imaginable insight experience . The probability to solve an item ( r 5 2 . 013 , p 5 . 879 ) did not correlate with insight ratings . 3 . 2 | fMRI results Based on the subjective mean split per run and subject insight ratings , successful trials ( i . e . , trials with solutions ) with a rating below individual mean per run were classified as low insight solutions and those with a FIGURE 2 Neural correlates of Insight . Significant brain activation changes ( p < . 05 FWE whole - brain ) when the solution was found with a low feeling of Insight , that is , more analytical solutions ( RIGHT ) including areas associated with semantic memory retrieval and during Aha ! - moments , that is , solutions with a high amount of Insight ( LEFT ) , featuring the same areas and additional stronger VTA and NAcc activa - tions . Contrast of trials solved with high versus low subjective Insight rating ( BOTTOM , p < . 05 cluster - level ) shows the anterior superior temporal sulcus / gyrus ( Jung - Beeman et al . , 2004 ) and importantly highlights the nucleus accumbens ( NAcc ) as the subcortical core region of the Aha ! - moment [ Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary . com ] TIK ET AL . | 5 rating above the mean as high insight solutions . Out of these data event , regressors were used to model brain activity changes at the moment of the behavioral response ( i . e . , button press ) indicating the high insight versus low insight condition . The regressors for task included the whole period in which the participants were trying to solve the problems and were differentiated into trials that were solved with low insight , with high insight , or not solved . 3 . 2 . 1 | Event While task activations for low insight and high insight trials both included the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus ( IFG ) , insular cortex , dorso - medial pre - frontal cortex ( DMPFC ) , precuneus VTA , hippocampus , striatum , and thal - amus , the activations for high insight revealed additionally stronger activations in large parts of the striatum most prominent the nucleus accumbens ( right peak : 10 , 11 , 2 1 [ MNI ] , T peak 5 10 . 08 , p FWEc < . 001 , left peak : 2 8 , 5 , 2 2 [ MNI ] , T peak 5 9 . 96 , p FWEc < 0 . 001 ) , and the VTA . The regions identified from the contrast of high insight versus low insight ( Figure 2 , bottom ) were covering parts of the anterior superior temporal sulcus ( aSTS ; peak : 2 51 , 2 10 , 2 20 mm [ MNI ] , T peak 5 4 . 53 , p FWEc 5 . 026 ) , NAcc ( peak : 2 6 , 14 , 2 4 mm [ MNI ] , T peak 5 3 . 70 , p FWEc 5 . 005 ) and caudate nucleus ( peak : 2 14 , 20 , 0 mm [ MNI ] , T peak 5 4 . 53 , p FWEc 5 . 005 ) . 3 . 2 . 2 | Task Comparison of task activity during trials , that is , ongoing problem solv - ing , solved versus unsolved revealed three distinct clusters on the cor - tex ( Figure 3 , top right ) : one cluster located around the middle temporal gyrus ( MTG ) , a second around the dorsolateral prefrontal FIGURE 3 Brain activation during TASK related to successful problem - solving . Significant brain activations for the whole TASK period ( i . e . , the total length of the RAT task block ) when solved compared to unsolved trials . The threshold of the t statistics was set to p < . 05 , cluster - wise FWE correction ( initial cluster defining threshold p < . 001 ) . Hipp , and thalamic regions , MTG , IPL seem to be related to successful solu - tion of a language task and reinforcement learning . Highest activation changes were observed in subcortical and cortical dopaminergic regions ( i . e . , NAcc , VTA ) and DLPFC leading to the hypothesis that insightful problem solving is highly dependent on different dopaminergic pathways ( Boot et al . , 2017 ) [ Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary . com ] 6 | TIK ET AL . cortex ( DLPFC ) , and a third cluster in the anterior cingulate cortex ( ACC ) . Additionally , we found a widespread subcortical network to be activated during the task consisting of the thalamus ( Thal ) , hippocam - pus ( Hipp ) , ventral tegmental area ( VTA ) , and nucleus accumbens ( NAcc ) ( Figure 3 , top left ) . To better specify most relevant subcortical nuclei , an additional analysis was performed on event contrasts using anatomical masks for nucleus accumbens ( AAL atlas ) and VTA ( Talairach atlas transformed to MNI space ) . Activation increase in the left nucleus accumbens ( NAcc ) was asso - ciated with insightful problem solving as compared to unsolved trials ( p < . 05 ) and in the right NAcc as compared to noninsightful and unsolved trials ( p < . 01 ) ( Figure 4 , first column ) . Given that only the posterior part of hippocampus showed rele - vant activation in the whole - brain analysis , we used a functionally defined brain mask based on the significant group activation , to con - firm with the approach used in current literature relevant for the study of insight effects ( Milivojevic et al . , 2015 ) . We found more activation in solution events with insight compared to non - insight solution ( p < . 05 ) and no solution ( p < . 05 ) in the left posterior hippocampus and solved with insight versus without insight ( p < . 05 ) and insight vs . not solved ( p < . 01 ) in the right hemisphere ( Figure 4 , second column ) . Bilateral VTA was significantly more active for solutions with insight compared to unsolved trials ( p < . 01 ) and solved with insight versus without insight ( p < . 01 , left hemisphere ; p < . 05 , right hemi - sphere ) ( Figure 4 , third column ) . 3 . 3 | Dynamic causal modeling Investigating effective connectivity differences between the three pos - sible trial outcomes , we analyzed the sum of intrinsic connectivity ( A - matrix ) and its modulation by the respective conditions ( B - matrix ) ( Figure 5 ) . We observed that DLPFC connectivity was only positive during high insight moments ( 1 0 . 095 6 0 . 121 ) and negative for low insight moments ( 2 0 . 051 6 0 . 121 ) . At the same time , we observed only for high insight , significantly positive VTA to NAcc forward ( 1 0 . 072 6 0 . 136 ) and backward connectivity ( 1 0 . 072 6 0 . 134 ) . VTA to DLPFC connectivity was also positive for high ( 1 0 . 065 6 0 . 133 ) and low insight ( 1 0 . 088 6 0 . 133 ) , yet not for no solution . Low insight was also characterized by VTA upregulation by the DLPFC ( 1 0 . 067 6 0 . 118 ) and Hippocampus ( 1 0 . 074 6 0 . 136 ) , which was not found in the other conditions . Positive connections from Hippocampus to DLPFC and NAcc for all conditions . Finally , the Hippocampus was inhibited during insight moments by the DLPFC ( 2 0 . 042 6 0 . 110 ) . 4 | DISCUSSION In this study , we focused on revealing brain structures involved during Aha - moments , and therefore used ultra - high - field fMRI at 7 T and a fast , multiband - accelerated sequence to assess brain activity while par - ticipants were solving remote associate task ( RAT ) problems . A creative endeavor requires divergent thinking ( Guilford , 1967 ; Torrance , 1968 ) as well as convergent thinking ( Dietrich & Kanso , 2010 ) . While com - mon tests restrain creative performance to divergent thinking , for exmaple , the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking ( Torrance , 1968 ) or the Alternative Uses Test ( Guilford , 1967 ) , the RAT is designed as a paradigm to measure both convergent and divergent thinking . While some of the problems might be solved analytically , insight trials let the subject experience a sudden jump to a solution experienced as pleasur - able Aha ! - moment . The increased signal - to - noise - ratio ( SNR ) at ultra - high magnetic field strengths ( Sladky et al . , 2013 ) allowed us to find robust effects in a number of cortical and subcortical areas that are particularly related to a higher level of insight ( Figure 2 ) . Thereby we are ( a ) corroborating former research linking insight to aSMG and hippocampus and ( b ) for the first time highlighting subcortical structures of the dopaminergic pathway , particularly the NAcc as a critical hub linked to this very moment of creative insight ( Aha ! ) . Interestingly , we found that the nucleus accumbens ( NAcc ) showed higher BOLD response during the solved versus not solved trials , and was also modulated by insight : higher insights evoked increased NAcc activations as compared to FIGURE 4 Condition - dependent activation of subcortical structures . Nucleus accumbens , hippocampus , and VTA activations were significantly stronger for insightfully solved trials . ROI definitions for bilateral NAcc , ventral tegmental area were based on a priori information from anatomical atlases , posterior hippocampus ROI is based on group statistics . * p < . 05 , * * p < . 01 in t test [ Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary . com ] TIK ET AL . | 7 lower insights . For the EVENT of insight , the NAcc was the most prom - inent area specifying this phenomenon . NAcc has been implicated in reward processing as it responds to pleasant stimuli or positive rein - forcement ( Abler , Walter , Erk , Kammerer , & Spitzer , 2006 ; Sabatinelli , Bradley , Lang , Costa , & Versace , 2007 ) , however , its functions are not restricted to the processing of primary rewards alone ( Salamone , Cor - rea , Mingote , & Weber , 2005 ) . This brain structure receives inputs from hippocampus , amygdala , and prefrontal cortex ( e . g . , orbitofrontal , medial prefrontal , and ACC ) and sends outputs to basal ganglia , dorsal thalamus , substantia nigra ( SN ) , ventral tegmental area ( VTA ) , and the reticular formation ( Floresco , Blaha , Yang , & Phillips , 2001 ; Haber & McFarland , 1999 ) . Resting - state functional connectivity ( Cauda et al . , 2011 ) revealed that the NAcc is functionally connected to the orbito - frontal and prefrontal cortex , globus pallidus , thalamus , midbrain , amyg - dala , and insula . These structural connections place the NAcc in a good position to functionally integrate processes within subcortical and corti - cal regions . The connection between NAcc , hippocampus , and medial prefrontal cortex ( see below ) , has the potential to explain the effects of positive mood on insight ( Isen , Daubman , & Nowicki , 1987 ; Subrama - niam et al . , 2009 ) . Increased nucleus accumbens activation as seen in our study may reflect the sudden jump to a solution candidate accompanied by a moment of relief , ease , joy , and confidence com - monly referred to as Aha ! - moment . Supposing that the last phases of insight processing follows a reward like pattern , a rewarding pro - cess during insightful problem solving , leads to reinforced learning ( conditioning ) for insightful solutions resulting in memory consolida - tion as reflected by increased hippocampal activity . Another area specific to higher insight was the head of the caudate nucleus . Boot , Baas , van Gaal , Cools , and Dreu ( 2017 ) propose the striatal pathway to be involved in cognitive flexibility , including perspective switching , divergent thinking , broad attention , and facilitated access to remote associations . Stronger activations in striatal areas associ - ated with insight therefore strongly correspond with the task demands of the RAT and go in line with the proposed model by Boot et al . ( 2017 ) of dopaminergic pathways to be involved in dif - ferent demands of creative thinking . Dopaminergic midbrain struc - tures , such as the VTA and substantia nigra , have recently been linked with the encoding of the expected certainty about a desired outcome ( Schwartenbeck , FitzGerald , Mathys , Dolan , & Friston , 2014 ) . While they found an effect related to the estimation of preci - sion of an anticipated future reward , it did not relate to the respec - tive value of this reward . In this study , we found that activation in the VTA was strongly associated with finding solutions ( Figure 3 ) , and showed heightened activity during highly insightful trials ( Figure 2 ) , which corresponds to the first person phenomenology of cer - tainty that is usually associated with insight moments . As already discussed by Kounios and Beeman ( 2014 ) with EEG and fMRI , the middle temporal cortex is an important cortical hub for insightful problem solving . We were able to extend this finding , show - ing that the left anterior MTG / STS shows heightened activation for stronger insight solutions . The anterior MTG is involved in phoneme perception ( Du , Buchsbaum , Grady , & Alain , 2014 ) . Its involvement in insight during the solution of a verbal jigsaw might represent increased phonemic search as strategy to solve the item . An alternative interpre - tation is that of Jung - Beeman ( 2005 ) , which suggests that temporal areas would be appropriate for integration with unusual or unexpected words . Critically , the anterior MTG / STS remains higher activated for insightful problem solving , which might be indicative for the cognitive functions associated with this brain area to be generally involved in more insightful problem solving . As stated in the verbal overshadowing theory cf . Chein and Weisberg ( 2014 ) , insight will only take place unconsciously and nonverbally eluding the individuals cognitive control . However , being exposed to irrelevant speech during insight problems increased performance ( Ball , Marsh , Litchfield , Cook , & Booth , 2015 ) , suggesting that pure phonemic search during RAT might potentially have led to facilitated insight in our study . The hippocampus has already been linked to insight in previous fMRI studies ( Kizilirmak et al . , 2016a ; Luo & Niki , 2003 ; Zhao , Zhou , Xu , Fan , & Han , 2014 ) . However , previous studies did not let partici - pants find the solution to word riddles on their own but exposed them to the correct answers with one conventional answer and one novel solution possibility . Therefore it is not clear if this contrast reflects insight in given solution candidates rather than self - generated , creative solutions . The hippocampus plays a central role in memory consolida - tion and retrieval . It has been known for a long time that animals ( Epstein , Kirshnit , Lanza , & Rubin , 1984 ) and humans ( Auble , Franks , & Soraci , 1979 ) undergoing problem - solving tasks , show improved mem - ory for content that was associated with an insight moment . Luo and Niki ( 2003 ) were the first to show activation in the right hippocampus ( not exceeding FWE threshold ) in an fMRI experiment when subjects performed an insightful problem - solving task ( i . e . , Japanese riddles ) and linked them with the formation of novel associations and breaking of mental fixations . A very recent study on narrative comprehension was FIGURE 5 Condition - dependent effective connectivity of subcortical structures . Most importantly , DLPFC connectivity was only positive during high insight and negative for low insight moments . Additionally , high insight was associated with significantly positive VTA to NAcc forward ( 1 0 . 072 6 0 . 136 ) and backward connectivity ( 1 0 . 072 6 0 . 134 ) . Bayesian model averaging group results of intrinsic connectivity plus modulation , p < . 05 [ Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary . com ] 8 | TIK ET AL . able to demonstrate that activation in the posterior part of the hippocam - pus is strongly associated with the reorganization of memories after an insight , in terms of integrating life - like events to coherent narratives ( Mili - vojevic et al . , 2015 ) . Focusing their analysis on the posterior section of the hippocampus , revealed stronger activation for solution events with insight versus unsolved trials and those solved without insight ( left hemi - sphere : not significant ) . The present findings support the importance of hippocampal function in the integration and reorganization of associa - tions , particularly those of high novelty that are associated with insight moments . Neural correlates of solved trials were generally associated with — besides the already discussed areas — the bilateral IFG and insular cor - tex , inferior parietal lobules ( IPL ) , precuneus , and dorsomedial PFC ( DMPFC ) , especially if the trials were solved with insight , which are all core elements of the semantic memory network . These findings specifi - cally depict what is unique to the solution of linguistic puzzles and simi - lar activation patterns were found in association with metaphor generation ( Beaty , Silvia , & Benedek , 2017 ) . Binder and Desai ( 2011 ) summarize that the IFG and DMPFC are associated with goal - direction and selective memory retrieval . The role of semantic memory retrieval in creativity was currently stressed by Benedek et al . ( 2017 ) . The IPL is in the model of Binder and Desai ( 2011 ) is moreover associated with the storage of abstract semantic knowledge , while the precuneus is speculated to build a nexus between the semantic memory system and the hippocampus network associated with episodic memory . Activation patterns to the event of insight ( Figure 2 , bottom ) not only extend former findings ( Jung - Beeman et al . , 2004 ; Sandkuhler & Bhattacharya , 2008 ; Subramaniam et al . , 2009 ; Zhao et al . , 2014 ) for temporal lobe involvement in RAT to the left hemisphere , but also extend activation patterns to task - related motivational and affective subcortical areas . This is in accordance to the studies mentioned above ( Jung - Beeman et al . , 2004 ; Kounios et al . , 2006 ) , along with subcortical areas such as bilateral amygdala . The latter authors mentioned that the signal on subcortical regions was low , which could have caused some effects to be undetected , especially in regions near the temporal pole and orbitofrontal areas , which are more prone to magnetic susceptibil - ity artifacts . The activation in pre - SMA and ACC for high and low insight events , which were even higher for high insight events , can be related to semantic coherence judgments . Using a similar version of the RAT , Ilg et al . ( 2007 ) demonstrated that intuitive impressions of semantic coherence are associated with activation in these anterior midline structures . Explicit coherence judgments , however , were lateral and posterior within the inferior parietal lobule and right superior temporal lobe . As already mentioned , our results show robust activation in bilat - eral IPL for insight solution events . Comparing the activation during solved trials ( whole period in which the participants were trying to solve the problems ) to trials not solved revealed three distinct cortical clusters ( Figure 3 , top ) : one clus - ter located around DLPFC , a second cluster in the MTG and a last clus - ter in the subgenual ACC . While the DLPFC is involved in goal selection ( Feil et al . , 2010 ) , the middle part of the MTG is an associative area that plays an important role in the representation of abstract semantic knowledge ( Binder & Desai , 2011 ) . Medial prefrontal activa - tion is associated with monitoring brain areas for conflicting action ten - dencies ( Botvinick , Cohen , & Carter , 2004 ) , performance monitoring or the evaluation / processing of the solutions ( Anderson , Anderson , Ferris , Fincham , & Jung , 2009 ) . Kounios et al . ( 2006 ) found heightened activa - tion of the ACC prior to RAT problem presentation for trials that were followed by insight solutions and propose that the ACC ’ s role in problem solving is detection of conflicting solution strategies . According to their view , a highly activated ACC during problem presentation allows detec - tion of nondominant solution candidates . During solution of the task in comparison to nonsolution trials , additional areas of the dopaminergic midbrain including thalamic pathways , VTA , and substantia nigra ( SN ) as well as the striatum , especially the NAcc and the posterior hippocampus were highly engaged . This stresses the role of a positive reinforcement circuit related to moments of success as mentioned above . In this study , we have shown that structures of the dopaminergic midbrain are associated with solutions per se and especially with highly insightful solutions . By means of investigating the association between task solution and insightful problem solving in a large independent sam - ple , we showed that there is no relationship between the difficulty of the items and Aha ! - ratings . These results suggest that there is a certain degree of specificity to the insight rating which is not overlapping with pure solution of an item . In addition to the robust replication of activa - tions in cortical regions reported in previous studies , we have estab - lished herein an association between insightful problem solving to subcortical structures . Aha ! - moments are characterized by hyperactiva - tion in ( a ) nucleus accumbens , which has been shown to be involved in the feeling of relief , ease , and joy , ( b ) VTA , which is related to the encoding of certainty about a decision , ( c ) the posterior hippocampus , responsible for memory reorganization following an insight , and ( d ) aSTS / STG associated coarse semantic coding . Solution - related task processing periods induced stronger activation in ( a ) regions that are related with implicit judgment of semantic coherence and ( b ) nucleus accumbens and other structures of dopaminergic midbrain , indicating elevated mood compared to unsuccessful trials as well as ( c ) the poste - rior hippocampus , responsible for memory reorganization following a moment of success . Our results thus suggest that the Aha ! - event is a formative situation that goes along with learning processes and increased involvement in creating solutions . We suppose that the inter - play between VTA , NAcc , Hippocampus , and aSTS / STG stresses the Aha ! - Moment as a higher cognitive process not purely consisting of affective and rewarding components . As those structures are part of a dopaminergic pathway , associated with reinforcement , we suggest the Aha ! - Moment as a special form of fast retrieval , combination , and encoding process . Future research is needed to specify the exact network modulations that underlie the Aha ! - Moment in this regard . 5 | LIMITATIONS Limitations of this work include the inability to modulate the temporal evolution of the Aha ! - moment . For this purpose , a further combined TIK ET AL . | 9 fMRI / EEG experiment could further bring together evidence from methods with high temporal and spatial resolution . Furthermore , it remains unclear if significant differences between high and low insight reflected a pure affective epiphenomenon of insight as we could not demonstrate a causal relationship . Converging evidence from pharma - cological studies and combined TMS / fMRI studies targeting the DLPFC as an effective cortical hub ( Tik et al . , 2017a , 2017b ) could be imple - mented in the future .
