We assess if any epidemiological or clinical factors in SARS index patients were associated with increased probability of transmission . Methods : We used epidemiological and clinical data on probable SARS patients admitted to Tan Tock Seng Hospital . Using a case - control approach , index patients who had probable SARS who subsequently transmitted the disease to at least one other patient were analysed as " cases " against patients with no transmission as " controls " , using multivariate logistic regression analysis . Results : 98 index patients were available for analysis ( 22 with transmission , 76 with no transmission ) . Covariates positively associated with transmission in univariate analysis at p < 0 . 05 included delay to isolation ( Day 7 of illness or later ) , admission to a non - isolation facility , pre - existing chronic respiratory disease and immunosuppressive disease , need for oxygen , shortness of breath , vomiting , and higher lactate dehydrogenase levels and higher neutrophil counts . In the multivariate analysis , only three factors were significant : delay to isolation , admission to a non - isolation facility and higher lactate dehydrogenase levels of > 650 IU / L ( OR 6 . 4 , 23 . 8 and 4 . 7 respectively ) . Conclusion : Clinical and epidemiological factors can help us to explain why transmission was observed in some instances but not in others . Background Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ( SARS ) was the first emerging infectious disease of the new century with epi - demic potential . First recognized on 26 Feb 2003 , SARS spread rapidly and resulted in 8098 reported cases and 774 deaths in close to 30 countries [ 1 ] . While there was no endemic transmission in the majority of these countries , explosive outbreaks were observed in China , Hong Kong , Taiwan , Canada , Vietnam and Singapore . Ongoing research points to an existing animal reservoir for the virus Published : 18 October 2006 BMC Infectious Diseases 2006 , 6 : 151 doi : 10 . 1186 / 1471 - 2334 - 6 - 151 Received : 26 January 2006 Accepted : 18 October 2006 This article is available from : http : / / www . biomedcentral . com / 1471 - 2334 / 6 / 151 © 2006 Chen et al ; licensee BioMed Central Ltd .

A key feature in the epidemiology of SARS is the wide - spread variation in the number of secondary infections caused by each potentially infectious case . While multiple secondary infections were traced to single individuals in several super - spreading events [ 5 - 7 ] , the majority of infected individuals did not cause any secondary infec - tions [ 7 ] . A recent paper showed that the efficiency of outbreak con - trol measures could be greatly enhanced if there were pre - dictive methods for identifying infectious individuals [ 8 ] . However , a review by Yu and Sung noted that the key risk factors for transmission remain largely unknown [ 9 ] . While two previous papers attempted to identify risk fac - tors for onward transmission from index patients [ 10 , 11 ] , both studies were restricted to household contacts , and neither accounted for factors such as clinical presentation , immune status and disease severity in the index patient , all of which have been suspected to play a role in disease transmission [ 9 ] . In this study , we analysed epidemiological and clinical data on probable SARS patients admitted to Tan Tock Seng Hospital . We attempted to identify if any of these factors could explain if individual index patients had transmitted the disease by the time they were detected and isolated , and developed a simple model for explaining the variability in secondary transmission . Methods We used data collected during the outbreak of SARS in Singapore from 1 March to 31 May 2003 . Diagnosis of probable SARS was based on the standard WHO case def - initions dated 1 st May 2003 [ 12 ] . Briefly , it required a patient to have fever , respiratory symptoms and a signifi - cant contact history , in the presence of a chest radiograph consistent with pneumonia or adult respiratory distress syndrome , or laboratory assays diagnostic of SARS . We defined an index patient as any individual who had been established , during contact tracing investigations , to have come into effective contact with susceptible individuals , be it in healthcare , household or other social settings . This study included all individuals who were part of the chain of transmission within Tan Tock Seng Hospital – i . e . all index patients causing secondary infections within ( TTSH ) , as well as all individuals exposed in TTSH who , in the course of follow - up surveillance and contact tracing , were found to have contracted SARS , and hence also became index patients . Index patients within TTSH were identified from outbreak investigations by on - site epide - miologists [ 13 ] . The hospital contact tracing team was also updated on individuals exposed in TTSH who were subsequently confirmed to be infected . This information was obtained , either when these infected individuals returned to us for clinical assessment , or through the Min - istry of Health in the event that these infected individuals presented elsewhere . The team then collated epidemio - logical information on dates of onset , admission and iso - lation for these index patients , and verified with other healthcare institutions and the Ministry of Health if these index patients had in turn caused any secondary transmis - sion in either nosocomial or community settings . Secondary infections were linked to an index patient if either of the following criteria were met : - there was effective contact between the index patient and the secondarily infected patient , either as recalled by the index patient or the secondarily infected patient , or docu - mented in medical notes ( eg . of physical examination of an index patient by a healthcare worker who became sec - ondarily infected ) - there were movement records indicating that effective contact could have occurred between an index patient and a secondarily infected patient , with the same movement records indicating that no other index patients could be an alternative source of infection Eg . an index patient sharing the same room / cubicle as a secondarily infected patient , even if neither patient could give a history of direct contact with each other , as long as no other infec - tious SARS cases were detected in the same general area In situations where a secondary infection could be linked to more than one index case , the first index patient with whom the secondary infection came into effective contact with was considered to be the source of the infection . Effective contact was defined as conversation or physical contact within a 1 metre distance , where the index patient had to already be symptomatic from SARS , and the onset of symptoms for the secondarily infected patient had to be 2 to 10 days after the exposure which presumptively led to the infection . The above criteria were then used to classify all index patients as to whether the index patient had transmitted SARS to one or more other individuals , which was our outcome of interest . In the case - control analysis , index patients who caused at least one secondary infection were analysed as " cases " ; all index patients who did not cause any secondary infections were analysed as " controls " . Exposure variables of interest included the demographic , epidemiological and clinical features associated with indi - vidual index patients . Epidemiological variables were the context of the exposure to SARS for that index patient , the date of illness onset relative to the implementation of per - BMC Infectious Diseases 2006 , 6 : 151 http : / / www . biomedcentral . com / 1471 - 2334 / 6 / 151 Page 3 of 10 ( page number not for citation purposes ) sonal protective equipment ( PPE ) across the entire hospi - tal on 22 nd Mar 2003 , delayed isolation , and admission to a non - isolation ward . We defined delayed isolation as admission to isolation wards on Day 7 of illness or later , as an exploratory analysis of the data showed a sharp rise in the proportion causing secondary infections from Day 7 ( Figure 1 ) . Isolation wards were facilities where visitors were disallowed , and where healthcare staff wore special - ized personal protective equipment while managing patients . All other wards are hereafter referred to as non - isolation wards . This included general wards and inten - sive care units ( ICU ) and high dependency ( HD ) wards where isolation precautions had not been instituted by the time the index patient for that ward was admitted . Clinical signs and symptoms , as well as laboratory and radiological investigations , were obtained from a clinical database maintained for all probable SARS patients admitted to TTSH . Index patients were coded on whether key clinical signs and symptoms were absent or present on the date the patient was moved to isolation . For labora - tory investigations , we used the results of tests carried out closest in time to the date of isolation . Co - morbid chronic illnesses were grouped as those with possible impact on respiratory function ( pre - existing ischemic heart disease / congestive cardiac failure , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ) , and those that could suppress the immune status ( diabetes mellitus , chronic renal failure , malignancies , chronic immunosuppressive therapies ) . We then identified factors significantly associated with secondary transmission through a univariate analysis . In the multivariate analyses , we started from the most signif - icant factor identified in the univariate analysis , and then performed a forward step - wise regression , using the likeli - hood ratio test to see if inclusion of the next covariate sig - nificantly improved the fit of the multivariate model . Odds ratio and their 95 % confidence intervals are pre - sented as estimates of the effect sizes . The final multivari - ate model was then used to model the probability of transmission for combinations of individual patient char - acteristics . All statistical analyses were performed using Stata V9 . 0 ( Stata Corp , Tex ) for Windows , with the level of signifi - cance set at 5 % . Ethical Approval Ethical approval for the clinical database and its subse - quent use in this study was granted by the TTSH Hospital SARS Clinical Management Workgroup and the institu - tional representative for the hospital .

BMC Infectious Diseases 2006 , 6 : 151 http : / / www . biomedcentral . com / 1471 - 2334 / 6 / 151 Page 4 of 10 ( page number not for citation purposes ) Results In all , 106 individuals satisfied our study inclusion criteria of being part of the chain of transmission within TTSH . Epidemiological investigations identified secondary transmission in 24 index patients , including 4 which were involved in super - spreading events ; 10 of the 24 index patients caused secondary transmission within TTSH itself , while another 14 index patients caused secondary transmission in other healthcare institutions and / or the community . Two index patients with secondary transmis - sion , and six index patients without secondary transmis - sion , had to be excluded due to missing information on key variables . In all , 22 index patients who transmitted the disease were analysed as " cases " , against 76 index patients with no identifiable secondary transmission serving as the " controls " . Table 1 presents the characteristics of our study popula - tion . In all , 58 % were infected in the course of their duty as healthcare workers . Another 10 % were infected while admitted as inpatients of TTSH for unrelated medical con - ditions and , with the exception of the imported index patient , the remainder was infected while visiting friends and relatives in TTSH . 90 % of our cases eventually devel - oped radiographic abnormalities , and positive confirma - tory tests for SARS - CoV infection were available for 93 % of the study patients . Median values for the laboratory investigations fell within the accepted reference ranges ; for all subsequent analysis , we compared index patients with the most extreme quartile of results against all other index patients . Table 2 compares index patients with and without trans - mission . None of the demographic characteristics were significantly associated with increased risk of transmis - sion . However , index patients originally infected as inpa - tients were more likely to transmit the disease . Delay to isolation and admission to a non - isolation facility were both strongly associated with transmission . In terms of clinical characteristics , pre - existing chronic respiratory disease and immunosuppressive disease were more likely to be associated with increased risk of transmission . There were also indications that index patients with more severe illness were more likely to transmit the disease ; while 4 / 22 ( 18 % ) of the index patients who transmitted the dis - ease had been admitted to ICU or HD by the time of iso - lation , this was observed in none of the index patients who did not transmit the disease ( p = 0 . 002 , Fisher ' s exact test ) . Moreover , the need for oxygen , shortness of breath , vomiting , and higher lactate dehydrogenase levels and higher neutrophil counts , were all more frequent in index patients who transmitted the disease . The results of the multivariate logistic regression are pre - sented in Table 3 . On multivariate analysis , the strongest predictor of transmission was admission to a non - isola - tion ward , followed by delay in isolation , and having a lactate dehydrogenase value > 650IU / L . No significant interactions were identified between these three covari - ates . We used the coefficients given in Table 3 to construct a tool for predicting if an index patient would have caused transmission by the time he / she is identified and isolated . The predicted probabilities ( p i ) of transmission in Table 4 are calculated for the i th individual ( i = 1 to 98 ) , using the equation below , where x 1 , x 2 , and x 3 are indicator variables taking on the values of 1 for those with delayed isolation , admission to a non - isolation ward , and lactate dehydrogenase > 650 IU / L respectively ; the term takes the value of 0 in the absence of each respective indicator . The results of the predictive model ( Table 4 ) illustrate the wide variability in transmission observed between index patients . While index patients with two or more risk fac - tors have a predicted probability of transmission exceed - ing 0 . 5 , they comprise only 20 % of our study population . If we use the model in a predictive fashion , we see that , under the best - case scenario , when no risk factors are present at the point of isolation , the predicted probability that transmission has occurred is less than 5 % . In con - trast , in a situation where all the three significant risk fac - tors are present , the model predicts that there is a 97 % chance of secondary transmission having occurred . An ROC for the model was plotted ( not shown ) . The area under the curve was 0 . 903 ( 95 % CI 0 . 832 – 0 . 974 ) , indicat - ing that the model had a very good ability to discriminate index patients with secondary transmission from those with no secondary transmission . Discussion Our study confirms previous observations that the major - ity of SARS transmission is caused by a minority of cases [ 7 ] . Moreover , we have identified several key factors asso - ciated with an increased probability of transmission , and show that the main determinants were delayed isolation ( Day 7 or later ) , admission to a non - isolation ward , and higher lactate dehydrogenase values at the time of isola - tion . These findings are important in several ways . Firstly , our findings improve the current understanding of SARS transmission .

isola - tion ward . This has previously been suspected based on outbreak descriptions from healthcare settings . For exam - ple , in an outbreak of SARS among hospital workers in a community hospital in Hong Kong , it was observed that most staff was infected from exposure to patients with unsuspected SARS in non - isolation wards [ 15 ] . Similar observations of nosocomial transmission arising from unsuspected , non - isolated cases of SARS have been made across different countries and different hospital settings . These include other community hospitals [ 16 , 17 ] , acute care wards [ 5 , 18 , 19 ] , intensive care units [ 20 , 21 ] , and emergency rooms [ 22 , 23 ] . While such descriptive accounts may be faulted on the basis of reporting biases , we were able to confirm through this analytic study that index patients admitted without isolation precautions were much more likely to result in secondary transmission of SARS . In addition , we are able to show the association of patient factors with transmission probability . While multiple symptoms and clinical manifestations are significantly associated with transmission in the univariate analysis , variables such as oxygen dependency , prior history of co - morbid illness , higher neutrophil counts and lactate dehy - drogenase levels are correlated to each other and to dis - ease severity [ 24 , 25 ] . It was not surprising therefore that , in the multivariate analysis , only the strongest predictor of disease severity is retained . Higher levels of lactate dehy - drogenase had previously been found to be one of the best correlates of severe disease [ 26 ] . As higher viral loads have also been found to be associated with more severe disease [ 27 ] , it would hence be reasonable to hypothesize that higher viral loads may be the underlying mechanism for the increased risk of transmission in patients who are more severely ill . Although no one has directly linked viral load to infec - tiousness , others have previously observed an association between disease severity in the index patient and disease transmission . Shen and colleagues found an association between disease severity , defined as eventual progression to death , and the extent of transmission , although their findings were based only on a univariate analysis of four super - spreading events against 73 other case - patients [ 5 ] . Numerous outbreak reports , including incidents of trans - mission in intensive care units [ 19 , 21 ] , the key super - spreading event in hotel M [ 28 ] , the outbreak in Vietnam [ 29 ] , as well as the flight from Hong Kong to Beijing on which 13 passengers were infected [ 30 ] , all involved index patients who succumbed to their illness shortly after . It would appear therefore that , not only is disease severity associated with the probability of transmission , but it is also a factor in the intensity of transmission . The link may lie in the number of susceptible contacts exposed to such Table 4 : Predictive model showing probability of transmission for index patients with different combinations of risk factors Risk factor combination , sorted by decreasing probability of transmission Total index patients in group Cumulative % of all patients Predicted probability of transmission Expected no . with transmission Observed no . with transmission Delayed isolation + Admitted non - isolation + lactate dehydrogenase > 650 IU / L 7 7 . 1 % 0 . 969 6 . 78 6 Delayed isolation + Admitted non - isolation 2 9 . 2 % 0 . 867 1 . 73 2 Admitted non - isolation + lactate dehydrogenase > 650 IU / L 3 12 . 2 % 0 . 828 2 . 48 3 Delayed isolation + lactate dehydrogenase > 650 IU / L 6 18 . 4 % 0 . 565 3 . 39 3 Admitted non - isolation only Nil 18 . 4 % 0 . 504 - - Delayed isolation only 19 37 . 8 % 0 . 215 4 . 09 5 Lactate dehydrogenase > 650 IU / L only 8 45 . 9 % 0 . 168 1 . 34 2 No risk factors 53 100 . 0 % 0 . 041 2 . 17 1 Table 3 : Multivariate analysis of factors associated with transmission Features OR ( 95 % CI ) p - values Epidemiological features Delayed isolation ( on Day 7 or later ) 6 . 43 ( 1 . 66 – 24 . 84 ) 0 . 007 Ever admitted to a non - isolation ward 23 . 83 ( 2 . 41 – 235 . 27 ) 0 . 007 Laboratory investigations - maximum lactate dehydrogenase > 650IU / L 4 . 73 ( 1 . 14 – 19 . 65 ) 0 . 032 BMC Infectious Diseases 2006 , 6 : 151 http : / / www . biomedcentral . com / 1471 - 2334 / 6 / 151 Page 8 of 10 ( page number not for citation purposes ) severely ill patients , and follow - up studies on the Singa - pore data are in progress to verify this hypothesis . Our findings have several key implications . Firstly , because admission to non - isolation wards was the most important predictor of secondary transmission , good case - detection and infection control at the point of entry into the inpatient healthcare setting is a priority area in the management of SARS outbreaks . Secondly , we have shown through our predictive model that there is a vast and real difference in the risk of transmission between dif - ferent index patients . In the majority of cases , with no risk factors , the predicted probability of secondary transmis - sion is small , whereas in those with a combination of the various factors , the risk of transmission is many times greater . Moreover , as Lloyd - Smith and colleagues pointed out , this variability in transmission risk amongst cases is not restricted to SARS , but may be common to other infec - tious diseases [ 8 ] . This raises the possibility that manage - ment of future outbreaks of emerging and re - emerging infectious diseases should include real - time analysis of clinical and epidemiological correlates similar to the one we have performed , so as to facilitate targeted outbreak interventions . We acknowledge several limitations and weaknesses in our study . Firstly , the assessment of epidemiological link - ages was partially subjective , and dependant on the infor - mation volunteered by index patients and family members . However , close to 7 out of every 10 infected contacts were healthcare workers and household mem - bers ( data not shown ) , for which epidemiological link - ages were obvious , and we are hence confident that the 22 index patients analysed as " cases " did transmit SARS to at least one other individual . The key weakness of our study therefore , is whether some of the index patients analysed as " controls " actually caused undetected transmission . With regards to this , we note that , within TTSH itself , 18 of 105 individuals infected in TTSH could not be defi - nitely linked to a single index patient by the criteria we used . Of these , 3 were suspected to be linked to 3 of the index patients which were already classified as " cases " on the basis of having infected other individuals , 10 were exposed to multiple index cases within one single ward where a super - spreading event had occurred , and in 5 individuals we could not trace the infection to a specific source case or even a definite location within TTSH . In addition , any of our 76 controls could also have caused asymptomatic secondary infections , and we hence acknowledge that some bias from misclassification of " cases " as " controls " would be inherent in our study . However , we believe that comparing the index patients which caused secondary transmission against a set of imperfect controls is a superior approach to simply draw - ing qualitative conclusions on possible factors associated with transmission based on descriptions of index patients with transmission , and we have done so while attempting to minimise biases by the use of fairly stringent criteria in linking any index patients and secondary infections . We also acknowledge that recall and interviewer bias could have affected ascertainment of symptomatology and the timing onset . However , the other key findings of admis - sion to a non - isolation ward and having higher lactate dehydrogenase levels are fairly objective criteria . Thirdly , the number of patients who transmitted was small . Con - sequently , the study may have lacked power to identify some important risk factors . The small number of events also contributed to the wide confidence intervals for some of the odds ratios . Also , unmeasured confounders could have affected the results of the study . In particular , other than including a variable for admission to non - isolation wards , we did not measure the characteristics of exposed susceptible individuals and the environmental circum - stances surrounding the index patients . These would have included the size and configuration of households exposed to these index patients , and for patients admitted to non - isolation wards , the type of wards and any proce - dures the index patients were subjected to , as these may have resulted in differences in opportunities for transmis - sion . Household factors have been explored in other work [ 10 , 11 ] but hospital - related factors remain a subject for future research , and would require a larger dataset of index patients admitted to non - isolation wards , or meth - odologies treating entire wards rather than individual index patients as the unit of analysis . In the absence of more detailed data and a larger dataset on household and hospital - related circumstances surrounding the index patients , we have opted simply to group the combined effect of transmission in these settings , and hence cannot rule out the possibility that unmeasured factors in the household and hospital environment may have con - founded our findings . However , while we could not adjust for these potential confounders , it must be noted that those factors found to be significant in the multivari - ate analysis had reasonably high odds ratios , indicating that any residual confounding are less likely to affect our conclusions . Finally , we acknowledge that the predictive model derived from the study needs to be validated exter - nally against retrospective data from other countries , or through prospective data , in the unfortunate event that SARS re - emerges . This is particularly since the infectious - ness of the virus is likely to vary between strains . Inter - strain variations in infectiousness was not likely to be an important confounder in our study , since all the index cases here were within a few generations of the original imported case which started the outbreak in Singapore . However , any re - emergence of the virus would possibly involve a strain with fairly different features , and hence extreme caution should be exercised in generalising our results to any future outbreaks . However , the final model BMC Infectious Diseases 2006 , 6 : 151 http : / / www . biomedcentral . com / 1471 - 2334 / 6 / 151 Page 9 of 10 ( page number not for citation purposes ) presented in this study does explain to a large extent the variability in transmission that was observed during the outbreak , and the prominent role of healthcare institu - tions and severely ill patients in the propagation of the outbreak . In the event of a future outbreak of SARS , our analysis pro - vides a starting point for risk assessment and risk commu - nication . Our study also makes the case for the timely collation and correlation of clinical with epidemiologic data . In any future outbreak of emerging and re - emerging infectious diseases , such analyses may well allow index patients with higher transmission probability to be iden - tified , and consequently facilitate better targeting of out - break control measures . Conclusion In this observational study amongst probable SARS patients , we have found that delayed isolation , admission to a non - isolation ward , and higher lactate dehydrogenase levels were independently and significantly associated with increased transmission risk . Our paper is the first analytic study to demonstrate the above associations while adjusting for possible confounders . Our final regres - sion model based on these three factors , while not perfect , does explain some of the variability in transmission between cases . It also hints that a similar approach may be possible for other emerging and re - emerging infectious diseases , if data on epidemiological data on transmission can be linked to clinical and laboratory data in real - time .
