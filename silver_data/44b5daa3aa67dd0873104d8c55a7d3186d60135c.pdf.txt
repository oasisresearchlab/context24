Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd 1 | INTRODUCTION 1 . 1 | The actin cytoskeleton The actin cytoskeleton is critical to the integrity of all cells . There is a dynamic balance between G - actin monomers and F - actin filaments that supports the development of key cellular structures necessary for proper cell shape , motility , the engulfment of particles and cel - lular fragments , and interactions between various cell types . 1 - 4 In ad - dition to the contraction and elongation of actin filaments , branching is also important in forming a three - dimensional network . 5 The ini - tiation of F - actin filaments is a thermodynamically unstable process , so actin nucleation proteins are required for initiation as well as pro - motion of branching . 6 , 7 In the immune system , these actin nucle - ating proteins and regulators respond to signals including antigen receptor ligation , chemokine receptor engagement , and integrin ac - tivation . 8 - 11 The Wiskott - Aldrich Syndrome protein ( WASp ) , as illus - trated in Figure 1 , is a key regulator of the actin cytoskeleton . WASp , its binding partners , and other actin regulatory proteins are the focus of this review . 1 . 2 | Regulators of the actin cytoskeleton WASp is expressed exclusively in hematopoietic cells . Much has been learned about its function from studying patients with muta - tions in the X - linked Wiskott - Aldrich Syndrome ( WAS ) gene and WASp deficient mice . Lymphocytes lacking WASp are abnormally shaped with changes in F - actin distribution . 12 This leads to impaired homing of WASp deficient cells to sites of infection . 13 , 14 WASp is heavily regulated both with regard to its protein sta - bility and activation . WASp interacting protein ( WIP ) interacts with WASp via its WH1 domain . 15 This interaction is crucial for WASp stability . In cells lacking WIP , WASp is virtually absent . 16 WIP also acts as an adaptor protein , bridging WASp with other regulators . 17 - 19 In the inactive state , WASp exists in a folded autoinhibited inactive conformation ( Figure 2 ) . The GTPase , Cell Division Control protein 42 ( CDC42 ) , acts as a WASp activator . Once loaded with GTP by a guanine exchange factor ( GEF ) , CDC42 associates with WASp , pro - moting its conversion into the active conformation . 20 - 22 Activated Received : 3 August 2018 | Accepted : 31 August 2018 DOI : 10 . 1111 / imr . 12716 I N V I T E D R E V I E W Primary immunodeficiencies caused by mutations in actin regulatory proteins Erin Janssen | Raif S .

Many of these actin regulatory proteins are exclusively ex - pressed in leukocytes and regulate the formation and branching of actin filaments . Their absence or abnormal function leads to defects in immune cell shape , cellular projections , migration , and signaling . Through the study of patients’ mutations and generation of mouse models that recapitulate the patients’ phenotypes , our labora - tory and others have gained a better understanding of the role these proteins play in cell biology and the underlying pathogenesis of immunodeficiencies and immune dysregulatory syndromes . K E Y WO R DS actin , primary immunodeficiencies , WASp This article is part of a series of reviews covering Lessons primary immunodeficiencies teach about the healthy and diseased immune system appearing in Volume 287 of Immunological Reviews . 122 | JANSSEN ANd GEHA WASp associates with and regulates the Actin Related Proteins 2 / 3 ( ARP2 / 3 ) complex . 23 The ARP2 / 3 complex is critical for the nucle - ation of actin filaments and assembly of branching actin filaments . 24 The ARP2 / 3 complex is regulated by five subunits , ARP2 / 3 Complex 1 - 5 ( ARPC1 - 5 ) . The combination of regulatory subunits associated with ARP2 / 3 affects its function and stability . 25 The CDC42 GEF , Dedicator of Cytokinesis protein 8 ( DOCK8 ) , interacts with WASp via WIP . WASp activation is severely impaired downstream of TCR ligation in the absence of DOCK8 . 18 , 26 DOCK8 activation may be promoted downstream of Mammalian STE20 - like protein Kinase 1 ( MST1 ) . 27 In addition to CDC42 , RAC GTPases have specific roles in regulating the actin cytoskeleton . The absence of RAC2 in neutrophils leads to severe impairment of F - actin assembly with abnormal migration of neutrophils . 28 Another DOCK superfamily member , DOCK2 , acts as a GEF for RAC proteins . 29 , 30 Lack of DOCK2 leads to impaired polarization and migration of cells . 31 DOCK2 and RAC proteins are also important for “inside - out” integrin signaling . 32 Several other proteins have been identified that regulate dis - crete aspects of the actin cytoskeleton . Moesin ( MSN ) and related proteins link actin with cellular membranes . 33 Coronin1A binds to mature F - actin filaments and enhances their severing by Cofilin . 34 WD - Repeat domain 1 ( WDR1 ) functions to promote Cofilin’s actin severing ability , and actin disassembly into G - actin monomers 35 , 36 Megakaryoblastic leukemia ( MKL1 ) is a member of the MTRF family that regulates the transcription of actin related proteins including serum response factor ( SRF ) and Profilin . 37 , 38 Mutations in the actin regulatory genes described above have been seen in human immune dysregulation and immunodeficiency syndromes ( Figure 1 ) . By studying these diseases and their murine counterparts , much has been learned about the regulation of the FIGURE 1 Actin regulatory proteins involved in human primary immunodeficiencies . The proteins discussed in this review are illustrated here in a prototypic immune cell . Activation of these regulators occurs downstream of antigen , chemokine , and integrin receptors ( not shown ) . DOCK8 and DOCK2 are important in the activation of CDC42 and RAC2 , respectively . Activated CDC42 plays a crucial role in WASp mediated activation of the ARP2 / 3 complex and nucleation of actin filaments and branching . RAC2 is important for downstream F - actin formation . MSN connects actin with the membrane . MKL1 is a transcription factor important for the expression of actin related genes . Coronin1A and WDR1 augment F - actin severing by Cofilin .

In the inactive state ( top ) , WASp is stabilized by WIP binding at the WH1 domain . In the inactivate state , the VCA region of WASp associates with the GBD domain and WASp is autoinhibited . WASp is activated ( bottom ) through several different mechanisms including PIP 2 binding to the basic ( B ) domain , CDC42 - GTP binding to the GBD , phosphorylation of tyrosine residue 291 in the GBD , and NCK binding to the PRR . Activated WASp assumes an open conformation leading to binding of the VCA domain to G - actin and the ARP2 / 3 complex .

Due to their predominant expression in hematopoietic cells , mutations in these genes often do not cause significant develop - mental issues in affected individuals . 2 | HUMAN DISEASE CAUSED BY REGULATORS OF THE ACTIN CYTOSKELETON 2 . 1 | WASp WASp is one member of the WASp family of proteins . Family mem - bers with more ubiquitous expression , including N - WASp , WAVE1 - 3 , WASH , are all embryonic lethal , 39 - 41 so the study of WASp has been especially informative . WASp has a five domain structure with an N - terminal Drosophila - Enabled / Vasodilator - stimulated phospho - protein homology 1 ( EVH1 ) / WASp Homology Domain 1 ( WH1 ) , a basic region , a GTPase Binding Domain ( GBD ) , Proline Rich Region ( PRR ) , and a C - terminal Verprolin homology / Central region / Acidic region ( VCA ) domain 42 ( Figure 2 ) . In its inactive state , WASp exists in the closed conformation , so that the VCA domain is inaccessible . 23 Downstream of receptor activation , WASp assumes an open , acti - vated conformation promoted by a variety of factors . They include binding of activated CDC42 to the GBD , binding of the adaptor pro - tein NCK to the PRR , phosphorylation at tyrosine residue 291 in the GBD , serine phosphorylation of the VCA domain , and PIP 2 binding to the basic domain . 20 - 22 , 43 - 45 Once in the active state , the VCA domain , including its WASp homology 2 ( WH2 ) domains , is accessible to the ARP2 / 3 complex . The WH2 domains bind G - actin , while the remain - der of the VCA region associates with the ARP2 / 3 complex . 5 , 46 The major effect of WASp deficiency is impaired ARP2 / 3 mediated actin polymerization . 47 The WAS gene is on the X chromosome , therefore individuals af - fected by WASP deficiency are male . There is a spectrum of disease severity depending on whether the WASp protein expression is pre - served , and which domains are affected by the mutations ( Table 1 ) . In classical WAS , affected males tend to have absent WASp ex - pression or mutations which severely impair WASp function . These individuals have a severe combined immunodeficiency associated with thrombocytopenia , eczema , and an increased risk of develop - ing autoimmune and malignant diseases . On the other end of the spectrum , patients with moderately reduced WASp expression have a milder phenotype referred to as X - linked thrombocytopenia ( XLT ) . These patients tend to suffer fewer immunologic complications , but still have significant platelet involvement . 48 , 49 Rare missense muta - tions in the GDB can disrupt the autoinhibition of WASp and lead to enhanced actin polymerization . Patients with these mutations have X - linked neutropenia ( XLN ) and develop congenital neutropenia and monocytopenia . 50 , 51 Due to expression of WASp in all immune cells , its absence or mutations in key WASp domains causes widespread dysregulation of the immune system . It has been shown that WASp expression confers a selective advantage for lymphocytes , macrophages , and platelets . 52 , 53 While lymphocyte numbers tend to be normal early in life , they decline with age , with a prominent decrease in naive T cells . 54 , 55 Unstimulated lymphocytes from WAS patients undergo accelerated apoptosis . 56 WAS patients also mount poor antibody responses to vaccines , especially polysaccharide antigens . 57 Adult WAS patients tend to have a decrease in the percentage of memory B lymphocytes , 23 along with a reduction in circulating T follicular helper ( Tfh ) cells . 58 T cells from WAS patients exhibit abnormal projections and de - creased microvilli . 59 They fail to increase their F - actin content and reorganize the actin cytoskeleton when stimulated with immobi - lized anti - CD3 monoclonal antibodies . 12 , 60 After stimulation with anti - CD3 , decreased proliferation , upregulation of activation mark - ers , and IL - 2 secretion are all observed in WASp deficient T cells compared to controls . 12 , 61 - 63 Like WASp deficient T cells , WASp deficient B cells are impaired in their ability to make filopodia and microvilli . They also have abnormal spreading , adhesion to surfaces , and migration . 64 , 65 The interface between the T cell and antigen - presenting cell ( APC ) is known as the immune synapse ( IS ) . Actin polymerization and reorganization at the IS is crucial for directing surface proteins and the recruitment of signaling molecules . 66 While WASp is not re - quired for the initial formation of the IS , F - actin “foci” polymerization downstream of TCR engagement in the IS is impaired in its absence . TABLE 1 Features of WASp Deficiency WAS XLT XLN WAS mutation Absent WASp expression or severely impaired WASp function Moderately reduced WASp expression Activating mutations in the GBD Infections Severe and recurrent bacterial , viral , and fungal infections Mild increase in infections Recurrent bacterial infections Platelets Decreased and small Decreased and small Decreased to normal Immune Phenotype Hyper - IgE , decreased response to polysac - charide vaccines , decreased T cell function Severe neutropenia and monocyto - penia , variable myelodysplasia Other clinical manifestations Eczema , autoimmune disease , increased risk of malignancies Mild eczema , may have an increased risk of autoimmun - ity and malignancy 124 | JANSSEN ANd GEHA Formation of these “foci” is important for optimal downstream sig - naling . 67 Furthermore , WASp is required for the reformation of the IS after periodic breaks in symmetry occur , and thus is important for IS stability . 68 WASp deficient natural killer ( NK ) cells also have abnormalities in their ability to form stable conjugates with target cells . 69 , 70 They have impaired actin polymerization and perforin accumulation at points of cell - cell contact . 69 WASp deficient neutrophils have impaired migration . 14 , 71 Macrophages , monocytes , and dendritic cells ( DCs ) also have defects in polarization and formation of actin - rich podosomes , lamellipodia , and filopodia . WASp deficient myeloid cells have poor adhesion to substrates and impaired migration to chemokines . 72 - 75 WAS − / − DCs have inefficient migration and form unstable IS with T cells . 76 , 77 WAS patients have increased expression of type - I interferons , and plas - macytoid DCs that are hyperresponsive to TLR9 . 78 This may be due to the role of WASp regulated actin polymerization in the compart - mentalization of TLR9 in pDCs , which limits hyperstimulation . 78 In addition to being prone to infection , WAS patients tend to have an increased incidence of allergic diseases and elevated serum IgE . 79 , 80 WAS − / − mice are also more prone to develop food allergies after sensitization with ovalbumin . 80 One explanation may be re - lated to defects in Th1 cytokine production seen in WASp deficient CD4 + T cells . Nuclear WASp has been shown to be important for transcription of genes promoting Th1 cell differentiation and cyto - kine production . 63 , 81 Patients with WAS and XLT are also prone to develop autoimmu - nity . 82 , 83 One study found that more than 20 % of WASp deficient patients had autoantibodies to common self - antigens . 84 The devel - opment of autoimmunity in these patients suggests that they may have regulatory T ( Treg ) cell abnormalities . While present in normal percentages , Treg cells from both WAS patients and WAS − / − mice have decreased in vitro suppressive abilities . 85 , 86 WASp deficient Treg cells also are unable to prevent colitis in a murine T cell transfer model . 87 In the context of autoimmune colitis , WASp deficient mice were found to have an imbalance in the Treg / Th1 cell ratio . 88 Both B cells and macrophages have also been implicated in the development of autoimmunity in WAS deficient patients and mice . WAS patients were found to have an increase in CD21 lo B cells , 89 , 90 which have been associated with autoimmune conditions . 91 , 92 They also have elevated serum levels of the B cell growth factor , BAFF . 90 Mice specifically lacking WASp in B cells have signs of spontaneous autoimmunity , with elevated serum IgM and increased production of autoantibodies . These mice exhibit expansion of germinal center ( GC ) B cells and increased differentiation of plasmablasts . 93 , 94 In ad - dition , both WAS deficient patients and WAS − / − mice have reduced percentages of IL - 10 producing regulatory B cells . 88 WASp has also been shown to be important for anti - inflammatory macrophage function . Expression of WASp in macrophages regulates the devel - opment of colitis in mice . 95 WAS is the prototypic immune dysregulatory syndrome affect - ing the actin cytoskeleton . Its absence or dysfunction has wide - spread effects on both lymphoid and myeloid cells . This leads to not only an increase in infections but also a predisposition to allergic , autoimmune , and inflammatory diseases . 2 . 2 | WIP WIP is a ubiquitously expressed protein with increased abundance in hematopoietic cells . We identified in a yeast - two - hybrid screen using WASp as bait . 15 Many of the mutations identified in WAS patients are within the WASp WH1 domain . These mutations are associated with decreased WASp affinity for WIP and increased degradation of WASp . 96 In WIP − / − T cells , Wasp mRNA levels are preserved , but protein levels are severely diminished . WIP stabilizes WASp by pre - venting its proteasomal and calpain degradation . 16 We found that a 41 amino acid peptide derived from the WASp binding domain of WIP was sufficient to stabilize WASp expression and correct defects in F - actin in a WAS patient’s lymphocytes with a mutation in the WH1 domain . 60 In 2012 , we described a female patient with a clinical syndrome similar to WAS . She had eczema , thrombocytopenia , and recurrent infections . She had no detectable WASp protein by immunoblotting but had normal WAS gene sequencing . Immunoblotting for WIP was also performed , and it too was absent . DNA sequencing revealed a homozygous p . S434X mutation in the WIPF1 gene . 97 Two additional reports have identified patients with autosomal recessive mutations in WIPF1 . These patients also had CMV infections and chronic bloody diarrhea . 98 , 99 Like WAS patients , WIP deficient patients tend to have increased serum IgE with reduced T cell percentages and memory B cells . 97 WIP − / − mice also have a similar phenotype and develop auto - antibodies and inflammatory disease . 100 WIP deficient lymphocytes have profound defects in their subcor - tical actin networks . 101 WIP deficient patient T cells are abnormally large with aberrant shapes , impaired migration to chemokines , and diminished proliferation to anti - CD3 . 97 , 99 Likewise , the T cells from WIP − / − mice have abnormal proliferation , IL - 2 secretion , F - actin po - lymerization , and polarization following TCR ligation . 101 In addition , WIP deficient T cells form poor conjugates with anti - CD3 bilayers or superantigen presenting B cells . 101 Interactions between WIP and the adaptors NCK and CRKL facilitate WASp recruitment to the IS after TCR stimulation 17 , 19 ( Figure 3 ) . WIP deficient CD8 + T cells fail to as - semble an IS and organize lytic granules toward target cells . 99 WIP is also important for B cell responses . In the absence of WIP , CD19 co - receptor activation and signaling through PI3K are im - paired . Chimeric mice lacking WIP in B cells have impaired responses to T - dependent antigens , reduced GC formation , and a decrease in Tfh cell generation . 102 WIP deficient B cells also have reduced capac - ity to migrate in vivo and have decreased activation of PI3K down - stream of CXCL13 . 102 However , Mice lacking WIP specifically in B cells are able to mount normal responses to T - dependent antigens . Their B cells are hyperactivated and have enhanced proliferation after BCR cross - linking . 101 The definition of WIP as a WASp protein stabilizer is an oversim - plification of its functions . WIP has both additional WASp dependent and independent functions . WIP binding to WASp plays an important | 125 JANSSEN ANd GEHA role in the fine - tuning of WASp mediated ARP2 / 3 F - actin polymeriza - tion . WIP binding stabilizes the closed conformation of WASp , so ac - tivated CDC42 and the additional signals outlined above are required for its full activation . 103 Fried et al determined using FRET that WIP and WASp interact via two interfaces . The WH1 domain of WASp binds the C - terminal domain of WIP once it has been phosphorylated by PKC - θ ( Figure 3 ) . A second interaction occurs between the VCA do - main of WASp and the N - terminal domain of WIP and involves actin . Once WASp is activated , the WH1 - C - terminal WIP domain interaction breaks , leaving the second interaction intact . This conformation ex - poses an ubiquitination site on WASp , leaving it vulnerable to degra - dation . 104 WIP is also important for the localization of WASp to sites of active actin polymerization such as the IS and podosomes . 19 , 105 , 106 WIP deficiency causes a more severe phenotype than WASp de - ficiency in both humans and mice . 107 Mice expressing a mutated WIP protein that binds WASp , but not actin , have normal WASp levels . B cells expressing this WIP mutant have a selective disadvantage com - pared to WT B cells and impaired GC formation after immunization . 108 Both B and T cells expressing the actin binding WIP mutant have ab - normalities in their actin cytoskeleton and impaired motility and che - motaxis . 108 , 109 WIP also associates with Profilin and Cortactin . 15 , 110 Profilin regulates actin dynamics in part by depolymerizing fila - ments , 111 while Cortactin localizes with the ARP2 / 3 complex at sites of F - actin polymerization contributing to ARP2 / 3 complex activation and actin filament stabilization . 112 , 113 WIP can serve as a bridge be - tween Profilin and the adaptor protein NCK . 17 Likewise , WIP facilitates the interaction between G - actin monomers and the Cortactin - ARP2 / 3 complex . 114 Independent of WASp , the WIP - Cortactin complex is im - portant for DC podosome formation and the ability of DCs to degrade the extracellular matrix . 110 , 115 WIP has several other binding partners including DOCK8 , HCK , and SRC that may play a role in WASp in - dependent processes . 18 , 116 , 117 A better understanding of WIP’s non - WASp interactions is needed to fully understand its multitude of roles in immune cell biology and is an ongoing focus of our work . 2 . 3 | ARPC1B The ARP2 / 3 complex is composed of seven proteins . Five of these proteins are regulatory subunits , ARPC1 - 5 , while ARP2 and ARP3 serve as nucleation sites for new actin filaments . 24 , 118 Arp2 and Arp3 gene deletions are embryonic lethal in mice , with Arp3 deficient mouse embryos not progressing past the blastocyst stage . Electron micrographs of Arp3 − / − blastocysts show a lack of the normal mesh - like actin structure at the periphery . 119 There are two isoforms of the ARPC1 protein encoded by the two tandem ARPC1A and ARPC1B genes . ARPC1B is strongly ex - pressed in human bone marrow . 120 Branched actin filaments asso - ciated with ARP2 / 3 complexes containing ARPC1B have increased Cortactin binding and stability . 25 Mice deficient in ARPC1B have normal development of T cells and platelets but develop hyper - IgE and vasculitis . In zebra fish , Arpc1b has been shown to be important for both T cell and platelet development . 120 Three reports have described patients with mutations in the ARPC1B genes . 120 - 122 While the immune phenotype was variable , all patients had thrombocytopenia . Their platelets were small with spreading abnormalities similar to WAS deficient platelets . 121 Two brothers were described who developed colitis and eczematous rashes . The elder brother’s condition was complicated by a CMV in - fection . They had increased B cell percentages with elevated IgG and IgE . 120 These siblings had a T cell defect with low T cell receptor exci - sion circles ( TRECs ) , T cell lymphopenia , reduced T cell proliferation to CD3 ligation , and limited TCR diversity . 120 Another patient had similar symptoms in addition to a small cell vasculitis . This patient , however , had normal TRECs and T cell proliferation to anti - CD3 . 121 Patient neutrophils were also found to have defects in motility and F - actin polymerization . 122 These species and patient differences may be due to the differential expression of ARPC1A to compensate for lack of ARPC1B . 2 . 4 | DOCK8 DOCK8 is a member of the DOCK180 superfamily of Rho family GEFs . 123 DOCK8 was initially identified in a yeast - 2 - hybrid screen for CDC42 interacting proteins . 124 The DOCK180 family members each contain a DOCK Homology Region - 1 ( DHR - 1 ) and DOCK Homology Region - 2 ( DHR - 2 ) domain . The DHR - 1 domain binds phosphoinositides leading to DOCK protein localization to cell mem - branes , 125 while the DHR - 2 domain contains the catalytic subunit that exchanges GTP for GDP for RAC or CDC42 . 126 , 127 The DOCK8 DHR2 domain has specificity for CDC42 . 18 , 128 For several decades , patients have been identified with an auto - somal recessive form of hyper - IgE syndrome ( AR - HIES ) . Sequencing of these patients showed no mutations in the STAT3 genes . 129 In 2009 , two groups determined that mutations in DOCK8 were the responsible for majority of the AR - HIES cases . 130 , 131 Many of the phenotypic similarities to STAT3 deficiency may be due to DOCK8’s ability to interact with STAT3 promoting its phosphorylation and translocation to the nucleus . Like STAT3 deficient patients , DOCK8 deficient patients have defects in STAT3 mediated gene transcrip - tion and differentiation of Th17 cells . 132 DOCK8 deficiency presents early in life as a combined immu - nodeficiency . Patients are predisposed toward developing chronic FIGURE 3 WIP domain structure and binding partners . WIP contains several domains important for the recruitment of its binding partners . Its WH2 domains contain an actin binding motif ( grey box ) that binds actin . WIP also contains 3 Actin - Based Motility 2 ( ABM2 ) ( purple boxes ) that bind to profilin . WIP interacts with NCK , CRKL , and Cortactin and has a Proline Rich Region ( PRR ) in the center of the protein . The C - terminus contains a WASp Binding Domain ( WBD ) and serine residue 488 that is phosphorylated by PKC - θ PRR WBD WH2 WASp CRKL Profilin Cortactin NCK HCK Profilin Profilin S488 P WH2 126 | JANSSEN ANd GEHA viral mucocutaneous infections and sinopulmonary infections . They also have severe skin inflammation and food allergies . Malignancies , especially those driven by the human papilloma virus ( HPV ) , are common in older patients . 133 , 134 The majority of patients also have elevated IgE levels and food allergies . 133 DOCK8 deficient patients have impaired antibody responses to T - dependent antigens and decreased memory B cells . 135 - 137 Mice expressing a mutation in the DOCK8 DHR2 domain have a marked decreased in marginal zone B cells and generate few , small germinal centers after immunization with T - dependent antigens . 138 In B cells , DOCK8 acts as an adaptor linking TLR9 to MyD88 and is important for TLR9 - driven B cell proliferation and differentiation . 135 T cells are also impaired in DOCK8 deficiency . DOCK8 deficient patients have reduced to absent TRECs , 139 and a reduction in recent thymic emigrants . 137 There is an increase in CD8 + T cells in DOCK8 deficient patients with an exhausted ( CD45RA + CCR7 − ) pheno - type . 140 In DOCK8 deficient mice , CD8 + T cells have decreased sur - vival and poor polarization of LFA - 1 when interacting with DCs . They also have reduced persistence of memory CD8 + T cells and recall to viral infections . 140 , 141 In a mouse herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) model , DOCK8 deficient mice are unable to control infection , and there is a paucity of CD4 + cells in their skin . 142 DOCK8 deficient T cells migrat - ing through collagen - dense tissues had abnormalities in shape and undergo abnormal elongation with subsequent fragmentation . 143 DOCK8 deficient patients are predisposed toward infection . DOCK8 has shown to be critical in immune cells other than T and B cells in mediating immunity . DOCK8 deficient patients have a decrease in circulating plasmacytoid DCs ( pDCs ) and a marked decrease in production of IFN - α after stimulation of PBMCs with CpG . 144 , 145 This lack of type I IFNs may lead to impaired clearance of viral skin infections . In addition , innate lymphoid cells ( ILCs ) in the gut are important in regulating the gut’s response to infection and damage . DOCK8 deficient mice have markedly reduced ROR γ t + ILCs , and those ILCs that are present have altered cytokine profiles due to abnormal STAT3 activation . DOCK8 deficient mice infected with the enteric pathogen , Citrobacter rodentium , are unable to control the in - fection and succumb unlike WT mice . 146 Due to similarities between WAS and DOCK8 deficient patients , we examined possible interactions between WASp and DOCK8 . It was already shown that in NK cells , DOCK8 exists in a complex with WASp and Talin . 26 Our studies revealed that in T cells , WIP acts as the bridge between DOCK8 and WASp . When the WASp binding domain is deleted from WIP , the association between DOCK8 and WASp is abolished . 18 In both T cells lacking DOCK8 protein and in those expressing DOCK8 with a mutation in the DHR2 domain , WASp activation is impaired , and F - actin polymerization and forma - tion of foci are diminished in response to stimuli . 18 DOCK8 deficient cells have several similarities to WIP and WASp deficient cells including decreased ability to migrate in three - dimensions , impaired spreading , and abnormalities in their ability to form a synapse with other cells . 18 , 128 DOCK8 deficient NK cells have reduced polarity toward target cells , defects in F - actin accumulation at the IS , and impaired cytotoxicity . 26 , 147 DOCK8 deficient DCs have impaired polarization and defects migrating in 3 - D . In DOCK8 defi - cient DCs , global activation of CDC42 is not impaired , but CDC42 activation at the leading edge is deficient . 128 Like WIP and WASP deficient patients , DOCK8 deficient patients are predisposed toward developing autoimmunity . 131 , 133 , 148 - 150 They have increased antibodies against self - antigens . 150 DOCK8 deficient patients have a defect in the peripheral B cell checkpoint associated with reduced Treg cell percentages and impaired Treg cell in vitro sup - pressive ability . 150 While Dock8 − / − mice do not develop spontaneous autoimmunity or inflammation , mice lacking DOCK8 specifically in Treg cells do . 151 , 152 These mice have hyperactivation of their T cells with increased production of pro - inflammatory cytokines . DOCK8 de - ficient Treg cells have an in vivo competitive disadvantage and poor in vivo suppressive activity . DOCK8 interacts with STAT5 , and DOCK8 deficient Treg cells have abnormalities in phosphorylation of STAT5 downstream of IL - 2 . 151 , 152 DOCK8 is important for TCR driven actin polymerization and stability of the IS in Treg cells . 152 While WAS patients develop eczema and food allergies , these are more severe and frequent in DOCK8 deficient patients . Unlike DOCK8 deficient patients , Dock8 − / − mice do not have spontaneously elevated levels of IgE . How DOCK8 leads to such severe allergic dis - ease remains a mystery and is an area of ongoing study . 2 . 5 | MST1 MST1 is a member of the STE20 protein kinase family . It contains an N - terminal kinase domain and a C - terminal SARAH domain , which allows it to form homo - and heterodimers . 153 MST1 phosphoryl - ates MOB1 . 154 In thymocytes , phosphorylation of MOB1 down - stream of sphingosine - 1 - phosphate ( S1P ) and CCL21 is dependent on MST1 . 27 Phospho - MOB1 interacts with DOCK8 and promotes its activation . 27 Patients with MST1 deficiency have recurrent bacterial , viral , and fungal infections . Similar to DOCK8 deficient patients , they are especially prone to viral mucocutaneous infections . 155 - 158 MST1 deficient patients have CD4 + T cell lymphopenia principally affect - ing naive T cells with decreased recent thymic emigrants . 155 Their T cells have upregulation of FAS protein and FAS mediated apopto - sis , 158 and they proliferate poorly to anti - CD3 , mitogens , and anti - gens . MST1 deficient patients also have hypergammaglobulinemia with variable response to vaccines . 155 Unlike DOCK8 deficient pa - tients , 136 , 137 they tend to have normal to high percentages of mem - ory B cells . 157 Mst1 − / − mice have reduced lymphoid tissue . Lymphocytes from these mice have impaired trafficking to peripheral lymph nodes . Mst1 − / − lymphocytes have defects in actin polarization , LFA - 1 clus - tering , and stable adhesion under flow conditions . 159 , 160 In addition , single positive thymocytes from Mst1 − / − / Mst2 − / − mice undergo in - creased apoptosis and egress from the thymus . 27 This suggests a combined survival and migration defect leading to the peripheral T cell lymphopenia observed in patients . MST1 deficient patients are also prone to autoimmunity . Two sib - lings with MST1 deficiency developed autoimmune cytopenias . 157 | 127 JANSSEN ANd GEHA Mst1 − / − mice have impaired Treg cell development and function . MST1 deficient mice develop autoimmune disease with hyperacti - vation of effector T cells and splenomegaly . This is ameliorated by transfer of WT Treg cells into Mst1 − / − mice . 161 Further study is re - quired to fully understand the interaction between MST1 , DOCK8 , and actin cytoskeleton . 2 . 6 | RAC2 Another Rho family GTPase , RAC2 , is only expressed in hematopoi - etic cells and is the major RAC species in neutrophils . 162 RAC2 has been shown to affect F - actin assembly , migration , and superoxide production in neutrophils . 28 , 163 The RAC2 p . D57N mutation has been identified in several pa - tients . 164 - 167 These patients develop severe bacterial infections and have impaired wound healing . Their abscesses have few neutrophils due to decreased neutrophil chemotaxis . 164 , 166 Neutrophils express - ing this mutation also have impaired superoxide production and granule secretion . 165 - 167 Another report described an infant with a de novo RAC2 p . D57N mutation identified by newborn screen due to low TRECs . He had leukocytosis and neutrophilia . In addition to the expected neutrophil defects , his lymphocytes had abnormalities in integrin - dependent aggregation despite normal CD18 expression . 164 Neutrophils expressing the RAC2 p . D57N were found to have decreased RAC2 protein levels . 165 The D57 RAC2 residue is con - served in all mammalian Rho GTPases and is involved in nucleotide binding . RAC2 p . D57N binds to GDP but not to GTP , and thus per - sists in the inactive form . 165 - 167 The expression of RAC2 p . D57N in mice also lead to the reduced endogenous activity of RAC1 . 166 Other RAC2 mutations may have more profound effects on lym - phocytes . Two siblings who were initially diagnosed with CVID due to IgA deficiency , urticaria , autoimmune thyroid disease , frequent infections , and the development of poststreptococcal glomerulone - phritis ; they were found to have a novel homozygous p . W56X muta - tion in RAC2 . They had B cell lymphopenia with gradually decreasing serum IgG . In addition , they had decreased recent thymic emigrants , a reversed CD4 : CD8 ratio with low naive T cells , and decreased Treg cells . Like patients with the p . D57N mutation , their neutrophils had abnormalities in their granules and decreased chemotaxis . 168 How different RAC2 mutations affect immune cells aside from neutrophils is not yet fully understood . For instance , RAC2 local - izes to the phagosomal membranes , 169 and in the absence of WASp , RAC2 may play a compensatory role . WASp deficient DCs have increased localization and activation of RAC2 to the phagosomal membrane . This permits increased MHC class I presentation to ac - tivate CD8 + T cells , 169 and possibly alters T cell activation patterns leading to autoimmunity in WASp deficiency . 2 . 7 | DOCK2 DOCK2 is a member of the DOCK - A subfamily that is primarily ex - pressed in hematopoietic cells . It dimerizes and is a GEF for RAC protein activation . 29 , 30 , 170 Unlike DOCK8 , DOCK2 contains an SH3 domain that interacts with Engulfment and cell Motility factor 1 ( ELMO1 ) . ELMO1 inhibits the ubiquitination and degradation of DOCK2 and also may play a role in its activation . 171 , 172 Binding of the DHR - 1 domain of DOCK2 to PIP 3 is important for its localization to the cell’s leading edge for proper cell polarity and chemotaxis . 173 DOCK2 accumulation is further augmented by binding of phospha - tidic acid to its C - terminal polyamino acid ( PAA ) region . 173 Patients with DOCK2 deficiency have recurrent infections and increased susceptibility to CMV . They have reduced antibody responses to T - dependent antigens . 174 , 175 In addition , DOCK2 de - ficient patients have T cell lymphopenia with low TRECs and a de - crease in naive cells , along with impaired in vitro T cell proliferation to mitogens . 175 DOCK2 deficient T , B , and NK cells have defective F - actin polymerization and chemokine - induced migration . 175 DOCK2 deficient NK cells also have abnormal degranulation . Fibroblasts from DOCK2 deficient patients poorly control viral replication with diminished interferon - α and λ production . 175 DOCK2 expression is important for RAC activation and cell mi - gration in response to chemoattractants . In DOCK2 − / − mice , T and B cell homing to chemokines is reduced , along with markedly de - creased RAC activation and actin polymerization . 31 In addition , lym - phocyte egress from the LNs in response to spingosine - 1 - phosphate is impaired in the absence of DOCK2 . 176 In B cells , DOCK2 is also important for integrin activation downstream of chemokines . 32 Like lymphocytes , DOCK2 − / − pDCs have markedly reduced RAC activa - tion in response to chemokines and subsequently impaired migra - tion . 177 They also have impaired production of IFN - α . 178 DOCK2 deficient neutrophils migrate more slowly and abnormally to chemo - attractants . They also have loss of polarized F - actin and PIP 3 at the leading edge of the cell . 179 In T cells , DOCK2 is also important for IS formation . RAC acti - vation downstream of TCR activation is abolished . In the absence of DOCK2 , translocation of the TCR and lipid rafts to the IS is impaired , while PKC - θ and LFA - 1 translocation are preserved . 180 Similar to DOCK8 deficient NK cells , DOCK2 deficient NK cells have normal conjugate formation but reduced killing with defects in lytic synapse formation . 181 Like DOCK2 deficient patients , DOCK2 − / − mice have increased susceptibility to infections . 182 , 183 Mice lacking DOCK2 are more susceptible to C . rodentium bacteria . 183 This may be related to de - creased neutrophils and macrophage in the lamina propria at later timepoints after infection . 183 2 . 8 | MSN MSN is in the ERM ( Ezrin , Radixin , MSN ) family . These family mem - bers link actin filaments to the plasma membrane and are important for cell polarization , rigidity , and signaling . 184 They have a multi - domain structure . In the inactive conformation , the C - terminal F - actin binding domain is unavailable . Activation is mediated by PIP 2 binding to the N - terminal FERM domain and threonine residue phos - phorylation . 185 The Rho GTPase , RhoA , was found to be important for MSN phosphorylation . 186 128 | JANSSEN ANd GEHA The MSN gene is on the X chromosome . Two reports describe several boys with frequent bacterial and varicella infections having mutations in the MSN gene . 187 , 188 They had decreased naive T cells with reduced proliferation and an increase in the CD57 senescence marker . While MSN deficient T cells were able to form an IS with Raji B cell , they had decreased chemokine receptor and adhesion marker expression along with decreased in vitro migration to the chemok - ines CCL21 and SDF1 α . 188 2 . 9 | Coronin - 1A Coronin - 1A binds the ARP2 / 3 complex and exhibits an inhibitory ef - fect on F - actin formation . This is through stabilization of the inactive ARP2 / 3 confirmation . 189 , 190 Mice with gain of function mutations in Coronin - 1A have increased inhibition of ARP2 / 3 activity in actin polymerization assays . 191 Coronin - 1 also associates with Cofilin and WDR1 , promoting disassembly of actin filaments . 34 Coronin - 1A is more highly expressed in leukocytes than other Coronins . 192 Several reports have described patients with muta - tions in the CORO1A gene . 191 , 193 - 197 Many of these patients were first identified as having T - B + NK + SCID with development of post - vaccination varicella 191 , 195 or lymphoproliferation with EBV infec - tion . 193 , 194 Patients also are prone to other mucocutaneous viral infections . 196 , 197 Unlike T − SCID patients with other gene defects , Coronin - 1A pa - tients have detectable thymic tissue . 193 Two siblings that we studied had a C - terminal frameshift mutation . While the CORO1A S401fs mu - tant was expressed at wildtype levels , it failed to form oligomers . T cells from these patients had increased F - actin accumulation . Thymic output was decreased and associated with impaired T cell survival . 197 This suggested that the C - terminal domain of Coronin - 1A is important for thymic egress and T cell homeostasis . Mutations in the Coro1a gene protect from autoimmunity in mice . A mutation in Coro1a suppresses development of SLE in mice . 198 These mice have impaired T - dependent humoral immune responses including altered GC responses . 198 Coro1a deficient mice have an ameliorated form of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis after immunization with MOG compared to wildtype controls . 199 , 200 However , Coro1a deficient T cells produce increased amount of IL - 17 , so their response with repeated immunization was enhanced with more severe CNS symptoms . 199 The enhanced Th17 responses are linked to a defect in TGF β R - mediated SMAD3 activation . 199 2 . 10 | WDR1 WDR1 or Actin - Interacting protein 1 ( AIP1 ) is expressed in most leukocytes as well as smooth muscle and cardiac muscle , but not skeletal muscle . As noted above , Cofilin is involved in severing F - actin filaments , 34 WDR1 interacts with and enhances Cofilin activ - ity by forming a complex with actin . 35 , 201 WDR1 also promotes rapid F - actin disassembly into G - actin monomers as opposed to shorter fragments . 36 A T cell line knockdown of WDR1 has reduced chemot - axis , which is offset by expression of an activated mutant of Cofilin . 36 Lack of WDR1 expression is embryonic lethal . Reduced expres - sion or activity in mice leads to thrombocytopenia , neutrophilia , and inflammation of the extremities , nose , and tail . Neutrophils from WDR1 mutant mice have elevated levels of F - actin and reduced di - rected migration with abnormal cellular localization of Cofilin . 202 Three reports have been published identifying children with autosomal recessive missense mutations in the WDR1 gene . WDR1 deficient patients have frequent infections , severe stomatitis , and impaired wound healing . 203 - 205 Their neutrophils have elevated basal F - actin levels with impaired spreading , polarization , adhesion , and chemotaxis . 203 , 204 WDR1 deficient neutrophils also have augmen - tation of their oxidative burst . 203 Monocytes are similarly affected in these patients and have abnormal morphology and reduced adhe - sion to substrates . 204 Lymphocytes are also affected by mutations in WDR1 . T and B cells from WDR1 deficient patients have abnormal spreading and actin containing structures , while lymphocyte migration along a chemokine gradient is intact . These patients have B cell lymph - openia with decreased progenitor B cells in the bone marrow and switched memory B cells in the periphery . Their percentage of Tfh cells is also decreased . 204 Two siblings with a homozygous WDR1 missense mutation pre - dicted to disrupt intramolecular interactions were identified with periodic fevers and high serum levels of the pro - inflammatory cy - tokine IL - 18 . Transfected cells form aggregates of mutated WDR1 protein that co - localizes with pyrin . 205 This is similar to the elevated levels of IL - 18 observed in mice expressing a hypomorphic allele of WDR1 . These mice also have a spontaneous autoinflammatory disease and thrombocytopenia . 206 This suggests that some of the effects of WDR1 mutations may be due to activation of the inflam - masome . More study is needed examining patients and mice with WDR1 mutations to fully understand the role of WDR1 in regulating actin dynamics and the inflammasome . 2 . 11 | MKL1 MKL1 is an important co - activator for the SRF transcription fac - tor . In its inactive state , MKL1 sequesters G - actin in the cytosol . 207 Activation of MKL1 leads to its release of G - actin and translocation in the nucleus to stimulate SRF mediated transcription of actin and actin related genes . 37 Recently , it was determined that MKL1 is ac - tivated through interaction with the F - actin binding protein Filamin A . 208 MKL1 silencing in a myeloid cells line resulted in a reduction of G - actin stores and abnormal expression of several actin - regulatory genes . 209 A patient was identified with a homozygous nonsense mutation in the MKL1 gene , who had increased susceptibility to bacterial in - fections . The patient’s lymphoid and myeloid cells also had a dra - matic reduction in F - actin . MKL1 deficient neutrophils have reduced phagocytosis and migration in vitro . DCs from the MKL1 deficient patients have abnormal spreading and impaired ability to form podo - somes . 209 MKL1 is an intriguing protein with functions both related to regulating actin stores and the expression of actin related genes . | 129 JANSSEN ANd GEHA Identification of additional patients with mutations in this gene would be enlightening . 3 | CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS Mutations in actin regulatory protein genes lead to a range of con - sequences in immune cells . Foremost , abnormalities in the actin cy - toskeleton lead to aberrant actin - based structures , cell shape , and adhesion . This results in impaired migration along chemokine gradi - ents and homing to tissues and is a hallmark of the immune dysregu - latory syndromes discussed above . In addition , cell - cell interactions including polarization and granule secretion from CD8 + T cells , NK cells , and neutrophils are affected by these gene mutations . IS forma - tion is significantly impaired in several of these diseases , leading to im - paired communication between T cells and APCs , as well as Treg cells and their targets . This leads to impairment not only in immunity but also promotes the development of autoimmune conditions . Molecular signaling cascades are often impaired in cells affected by these muta - tions . The actin cytoskeleton is important for localization of lipid rafts and signaling molecules to specific regions of the IS . In addition , many of these proteins function as adaptor proteins and can lead to other signaling abnormalities distinct from their roles in actin remodeling . These gene mutations are often tolerated in the humans and mice due to the redundancy of actin regulatory proteins outside of the immune system . Studying the consequences of their abnormal expression or functional mutations provides us with a better under - standing of their related family members expressed in cells outside of the immune system . Currently , bone marrow transplantation offers the best chance of cure for patients with mutations in actin regulatory proteins . Gene therapy is also proving to be a promising avenue , especially for treat - ment of WAS . 210 - 214 Through better understanding of the expres - sion , function , and interactions of these proteins , we seek to develop better targeted and tolerated therapies .
