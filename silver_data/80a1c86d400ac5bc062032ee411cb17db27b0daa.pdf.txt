Until recently , strategies for robust and quantitative development of pharmacological tools for manipulating phosphoinositide levels have focused selectively on PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 due to the importance of this lipid in growth factor signaling and cell proliferation . However , drugs that a ﬀ ect levels of other phosphoinositides have potential therapeutic applications and will be powerful research tools . Here , we describe methodology for the high - throughput screening of small molecule modulators of the inositol 5 - phosphatases , which dephosphorylate PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( the precursor for PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ) and PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ) . We developed three complementary in vitro activity assays , tested hit compounds on a panel of 5 - phosphatases , and monitored e ﬃ cacy toward various substrates . Two prominent chemical sca ﬀ olds were identi ﬁ ed with high nanomolar / low micromolar activity , with one class showing inhibitory activity toward all 5 - phosphatases tested and the other selective activity toward OCRL and INPP5B , which are closely related to each other . One highly soluble OCRL / INPP5B - speci ﬁ c inhibitor shows a direct interaction with the catalytic domain of INPP5B . The e ﬃ cacy of this compound in living cells was validated through its property to enhance actin nucleation at the cell cortex , a PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 dependent process , and to inhibit PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 dephosphorylation by OCRL ( both overexpressed and endogenous enzyme ) . The assays and screening strategies described here are applicable to other phosphoinositide - metabolizing enzymes , at least several of which have major clinical relevance . Most importantly , this study identi ﬁ es the ﬁ rst OCRL / INPP5B speci ﬁ c inhibitor and provides a platform for the design of more potent inhibitors of this family of enzymes . Phosphoinositide ( PI ) lipids derive from the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol at the 3 , 4 , and 5 positions of the inositol ring resulting in the generation of seven phosphoinosi - tide species with di ﬀ ering localization and functions within cells . Dynamic control of their levels and of their heterogeneous distribution within cellular membranes is achieved through the actions of an array of kinases , phosphatases , and phospholi - pases . Aberrant phosphoinositide metabolism underlies several pathological conditions , 1 most notably cancer , given the key role of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 in cell growth and proliferation . Accordingly , enzymes controlling the levels of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 are an important therapeutic target . 2 Other therapeutic uses of drugs directed against PI metabolizing enzymes have been recently suggested . 3 − 6 One important class of PI metabolizing enzymes are inositol 5 - phosphatases . Members of this protein family play a major role in the control of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , a PI that resides primarily , although not exclusively , on the cytoplasmic lea ﬂ et of the plasma membrane . Via direct interactions of its phosphorylated headgroup , this phospholipid has a broad range of actions , including e ﬀ ects on signaling sca ﬀ olds , ion channel function , exo - endocytosis , the actin cytoskeleton , and thus cell polarity and migration . Impaired spatiotemporal control of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 has been implicated in several leukemias , metabolic disorders , neurodegenerative diseases , and genetic disorders . 7 , 8 Addition - ally , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is the precursor of other important signaling molecules , such as IP3 ( inositol triphosphate , a soluble phosphoinositol ) , via the action of phospholipase C and PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 via the action of PI 3 - kinases . Both IP3 , as well as other inositolpolyphosphates ( IPs ) and PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 are also substrates of 5 - phosphatases , so that this class of enzymes has a multiplicity of key physiological functions . There are 10 mammalian enzymes with a conserved inositol 5 - phosphatase domain . Each enzyme has unique substrate preferences , IPs , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , or PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 , with one enzyme , INPP5A ( also called type I inositol 5 - phosphatase ) selectively acting on IPs . 9 Additionally , each family member has a speci ﬁ c pattern of tissue distribution and subcellular localization Received : March 1 , 2014 Accepted : April 17 , 2014 Published : April 17 , 2014 Articles pubs . acs . org / acschemicalbiology © 2014 American Chemical Society 1359 dx . doi . org / 10 . 1021 / cb500161z | ACS Chem . Biol . 2014 , 9 , 1359 − 1368 Terms of Use ( re ﬂ ecting unique sets of protein − protein interactions and preferential actions on speci ﬁ c PI pools ) . Thus , these enzymes display both unique and partially overlapping functions . Current methods for studying speci ﬁ c 5 - phosphatases rely primarily upon genetic models , overexpression , chronic enzyme depletion ( by knockdown or knockout methods ) , or changes arising from spontaneous mutations in human patients or model organisms . These methods , however , are susceptible to compensatory mechanisms . Thus , the availability of small compounds for the selective and acute manipulation of endogenous 5 - phosphatase activities , and possibly of speci ﬁ c member ( s ) of this protein family , would represent a powerful tool for basic research . These compounds could also have important therapeutic applications . 7 , 8 Assays toward the development of speci ﬁ c small molecule modulators of 5 - phosphatases have been reported , and some of them have led to the isolation of SHIP1 and SHIP2 inhibitors and activators , 5 , 10 − 13 but no inhibitors with selectivity for other members of the 5 - phosphatase family have been described . Here , we describe a screening strategy for the identi ﬁ cation of small molecule modulators of 5 - phosphatases . The initial high - throughput screens focused on identifying synaptojanin 1 and OCRL modi ﬁ ers . Synaptojanin 1 is the major 5 - phosphatase of synapses . 14 , 15 OCRL is a ubiquitously expressed 5 - phosphatase whose loss of function results in OculoCere - broRenal Syndrome of Lowe , a condition involving renal tubular dysfunction , developmental delay / intellectual disability , and congenital cataracts . Candidate compounds were then assayed for their activity toward other inositol 5 - phophatases : INPP5B , a close homologue of OCRL , and the more structurally divergent phosphatases SHIP2 , INPP5E , and INPP5A . Inhibitory e ﬀ ectiveness on 5 - phosphatase activity using di ﬀ erent substrates , such as diC16 PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , diC8 PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 , and IP3 was also analyzed . As a result of this comprehensive screening strategy , which could be extended to the isolation of modulators of other PI modifying enzymes , we have identi ﬁ ed a small molecule inhibitor with speci ﬁ city for OCRL / INPP5B over the enzymes tested in our panel and veri ﬁ ed the e ﬃ cacy of this compound in three separate assays in living cells . ■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION High Throughput Screening and Assay Development . We developed three di ﬀ erent assay formats for screening Figure 1 .

Biol . 2014 , 9 , 1359 − 1368 1360 compound libraries . These assays were complementary to each other , and the combination of three separate assays allowed us to exclude false - positive hits due to assay interference . Importantly , this strategy also allowed us to test e ﬃ cacy of our compounds against phosphoinositides with di ﬀ erences in both their lipid chain ( IP3 , diC8 , diC16 ) and degree of phosphorylation . Our main tool for the screening of 5 - phosphatase activity was a competitive ﬂ ourescence polarization ( FP ) assay that detects the conversion of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 into PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 , using a GST - tagged TAPP1 PH domain as a detector for PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 . Speci ﬁ cally , dephosphorylation of diC8 PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 produced excess , unlabeled , diC8 PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 , which competitively displaced a trace amount of BODIPY TMR - PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 pre - bound to the TAPP1 PH domain . 16 This assay was very sensitive and highly reproducible with Z ′ scores ranging 0 . 6 − 0 . 9 ( a score of 0 . 5 − 1 indicates an excellent screening assay ) . Representative data from this assay is shown in Figure 1a . Results from the FP assay were complemented by a malachite green assay ( Z ′ scores 0 . 5 − 0 . 8 ) , which was signi ﬁ cantly less sensitive but had the advantage of ﬂ exibility in the substrate used ( diC8 PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in our initial screening , also used subsequently for diC16 PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and IP3 ) ( Figure 1b ) . Finally , a mobility shift ( MS ) assay monitored the conversion of ﬂ uorescein - tagged substrate ( either PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 or PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ) using a combination of capillary electrophoresis and micro ﬂ uidics 13 ( Figure 1C , Z ′ scores 0 . 5 − 0 . 7 ) . This assay e ﬀ ectively removed signal contributions from compounds and reduced assay interference . However , dose response analysis in this assay was hindered by the speed of the detection step . Thus , this assay was primarily utilized to con ﬁ rm hits from the other assays . Our overall screening strategy is outlined in Scheme 1 . Using a combination of the FP and malachite green assays , a total of 37 579 compounds were screened in 384 well format for activity toward Synaptojanin 1 . The FP assay was used exclusively to screen for OCRL modi ﬁ ers in 384 well format with a total of 29 087 compounds tested . We choose a hit enrichment boundary of 3 standard deviations away from the median percent e ﬀ ect , and with this boundary we had a hit rate of 0 . 56 − 1 . 8 % . Hit pick plates , with 320 ( Synaptojanin 1 ) and 298 ( OCRL ) compounds were then tested with both enzymes , since each enzyme was screened independently with partially overlapping libraries . We found 33 compounds with signi ﬁ cant activity in the OCRL hit pick screens and 76 compounds with signi ﬁ cant activity in the Synaptojanin 1 hit pick screen . Compounds were further characterized with dose response . Many of the compounds identi ﬁ ed in the OCRL and Synaptojanin hit pick screens overlapped . Thus , for the dose response curves we picked 36 compounds which had either ( 1 ) activity toward both OCRL and Synaptojanin or ( 2 ) activity in two of our activity assays ( 22 for OCRL and 21 for Synaptojanin ) . We also included a known SHIP2 inhibitor as a negative control . 12 We initially measured 4 point curves with 36 compounds , of which 12 displayed inhibitory activity toward OCRL in both the malachite green and ﬂ uorescence polar - ization assays , and 10 displayed inhibitory activity toward Synaptojanin in the same two assays ( Supporting Information ( SI ) Table 1 ) . After the 4 point dose response , we followed up with a 12 point curve with the 12 best candidates . See Figure 1d , e for representative 12 point dose response curves . Our top compounds fell within the acceptable range for Lipinski ’ s rule of ﬁ ve for druglike properties ( Figure 2a ) . All were less than 500 Da , carried less than 5 hydrogen bond donors and less than 10 hydrogen bond acceptors , and had calculated partition coe ﬃ cient ( LogP ) values ranging 0 . 7 − 5 . However , many of the top hits were not soluble in aqueous solution , hampering their further characterization . Thus , we explored related compounds with enhanced solubility for activity in our assays . Structure activity relationship ( SAR ) analysis of the top compounds from both dose response and primary screening data prompted us to screen all other compounds in the available libraries with chemical similarity . We identi ﬁ ed eight major sca ﬀ old classes among the screen positives ( see SI Figure 1 ) . Compounds with signi ﬁ cant activity were further characterized by dose response , and the process was iterated several times . This iterative optimization process quickly showed that members of only the ﬁ rst two sca ﬀ old classes , Class I and Class II , produced multiple hits with favorable qualities . Criteria included reproducible IC50 values of less than 10 μ M , saturating dose response curves with maximal percent e ﬀ ects that reached > 90 % , and a Hill coe ﬃ cient that is close to 1 ( a steep dose response curve can indicate compound aggregation ) . In fact , even in the ﬁ rst 36 compound dose response analysis , one can see an enrichment of compounds belonging to Class I and II . In total , we identi ﬁ ed 13 compounds containing a triazolo [ 3 , 4 - b ] [ 1 , 3 , 4 ] thiadiazole with substitutions at the 3 and 6 positions that were grouped into Class I . Class II compounds , which comprised 24 members , contained a core benzyl amine group ( see SI Figure 1 ) . The three top compounds from Class I and Class II are illustrated in Figure 2A . IC50 values were in the low Scheme 1 . Schematic of Our Screening Strategy a a * denotes places where structure − activity relationship ( SAR ) - directed iterations occurred .

To our knowledge , none of the identi ﬁ ed compounds have structural similarity to currently identi ﬁ ed 5 - phosphatase modi ﬁ ers . We were particularly interested in YU142670 because of its chemical similarity to molecules in one of our main sca ﬀ old classes ( Class I ) along with a favorable calculated LogP value ( 0 . 34 ) , predicting better solubility . Interestingly , YU142670 , was present in our initial high - throughput screening but was not identi ﬁ ed as a hit due to interference in the FP assay ( Table 1 ) , which manifested as high background ﬂ uorescence values . When measured by dose response in the FP assay , this interference shifted the apparent percent e ﬀ ects of the compound in the dose response curves . Even with this background , saturating dose - dependent inhibition of enzyme activity by this compound was measured for OCRL and INPP5B ( although it did not reach 80 % e ﬀ ect ) and not other family members tested ( either no response , or a small response at very high concentrations of the compound ) ( see also below ) . To gain a more accurate measurement of the IC50 we measured the dose response curve for YU142670 in the malachite green assay with diC16 PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 as a substrate ( Figure 1D ) . In this assay , we reached 100 % e ﬀ ect on OCRL and INPP5B activity with an IC50 of 0 . 71 and 1 . 78 μ M , respectively ( Table 1 ) . Thus , given its favorable chemical properties , this compound became our lead compound for measurement of binding a ﬃ nity by Isothermal Titration Calorimetry and for several assays to test e ﬃ cacy in cell culture ( see below ) . As negative controls , we analyzed e ﬃ cacy toward two unrelated phosphatases : Shrimp Alkaline phosphatase ( SAP ) , a general phosphatase which can also act on nucleic acids , and Phosphatase and TENsin homologue ( PTEN ) , a PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 3 - phosphatase . No representatives from the two main sca ﬀ old classes displayed signi ﬁ cant inhibitory activity toward these enzymes , shown in Table 1 . A third enzyme , neutral bacterial sphingomyelinase , which shares a similar fold to the inositol 5 - phosphatases ( a DNase I fold ) , was also tested . This enzyme was not sensitive to any Class I compounds screened . Results with Class II compounds were not conclusive due to assay interference ( compounds caused a signal increase , which resulted in negative , compound concentration - dependent , percent e ﬀ ects ) . Selectivity within the 5 - Phosphatase Family . The core of the Inositol 5 - phosphatase domain consists of 11 β - strands mainly running antiparallel to each other , forming 2 β - sheets Figure 2 .

Biol . 2014 , 9 , 1359 − 1368 1362 surrounded by a layer of α - helices . 17 , 18 The active site sits in a relatively shallow pocket formed by the tips of the β - strands at one pole of the module ( SI Figure 2 ) , which shares several common features among family members . 18 The active site geometry is held in place by the core fold of the protein , which can withstand some variability in its sequence while maintaining the correct secondary structure . Thus , members of the 5 - phosphatase family have the same basic enzymatic function while displaying quite distinct amino acid sequences , as revealed by sequence identities for the human 5 - phosphatase domains ranging from 15 − 60 % ( sequence homology is ∼ 30 − 70 % ) ( see SI Table 3 ) . Di ﬀ erences in the regions surrounding the active site likely help determine substrate speci ﬁ city . 7 The relatedness of the catalytic domains of the human inositol 5 - phosphatases is depicted in a phylogenetic dendrogram in Figure 2b . In order to assess the speci ﬁ city of our compounds toward various members of the 5 - phosphatase family , we tested the compounds toward other members of this family that can act on PIs : INPP5B , SHIP1 and INPP5E . INPP5B is the closest homologue to OCRL , with 69 % homology in the catalytic domain . We chose SHIP1 and INPP5E as our other control enzymes due to their clinical relevance 8 and their sequence diversity within the family . The IC50 values for representatives from our lead sca ﬀ old classes are indicated in Table 1 . Assessment of the activity of these enzymes in dose response curves shows that while Class II compounds inhibit all 5 - phosphatases in the panel , no inhibition was detected when Synaptojanin , SHIP1 , or INPP5E were assayed with the Class I compounds ( see Figure 2c for a summary ) . Note that our original screening assays utilized either full length OCRL , or a construct of Synaptojanin - 1 containing the Sac1 and 5 - phosphatase domains . When we tested e ﬃ cacy of these compounds toward INPP5B we used a construct comprising only the 5 - phosphatase domain . The ﬁ nding that both compounds classes displayed activity toward the INPP5B catalytic domain indicates that they act on the 5 - phosphatase domain ( Table 1 ) ( see also below ) . We also tested our lead compounds in 5 - phosphatase assays ( malachite assays ) with IP3 as the substrate . IP3 is the precursor of other inositol polyphosphates and of pyrophos - phates , the molecules that result from the reversible phosphorylation and pyrophosphorylation of the inositol ring ( by well over 25 mammalian enzymes ) , to generate 13 species with important signaling functions . We included in this assay INPP5A , the only 5 - phosphatase that acts exclusively on IPs , while the other 9 members of the 5 - phosphatase family act on both IP3 and PIs with varied e ﬃ cacy . The identi ﬁ cation of small molecules that selectively interfere with either lipid or soluble substrates would be useful research and therapeutic tools with potentially fewer o ﬀ - target e ﬀ ects . Consistent with previous reports , we found that INPP5B ( here the catalytic domain ) displayed robust activity against IP3 , whereas OCRL had barely detectable activity at high enzyme concentrations ( SI Figure 3 ) . 19 , 20 Importantly , using IP3 as the substrate , as shown in Table 1 , we found signi ﬁ cant inhibitory activity of both compounds toward the catalytic domain of INPP5B ( IC50 values ranging 0 . 5 − 1 . 1 μ M ) . The same sca ﬀ old class with inhibitory activity toward OCRL , INPP5B , Synaptojanin 1 , INPP5E , and SHIP1 ( Class II ) also showed dose - dependent activity against INPP5A , while the Class I compounds did not inhibit INPP5A . Altogether , our dose response data suggests that Class II compounds are pan 5 - phosphatase inhibitors whereas the Class I compounds speci ﬁ cally target OCRL and INPP5B . Direct Interaction between YU142670 and the INPP5B Catalytic Domain . We utilized isothermal titration calorimetry ( ITC ) to measure interactions of the most soluble compounds of each class ( YU142670 from Class I , YU144369 from Class II ) with the catalytic domain of the OCRL / INPP5B subgroup of 5 - phosphatases . More speci ﬁ cally , we used the catalytic domain of human INPP5B due to its robust expression from a bacterial source , which was needed to produce su ﬃ cient quantities of protein for the experiments . We detected a speci ﬁ c interaction between the INPP5B catalytic domain and YU142670 ( Ka = 2 . 35 × 10 5 ± 8 . 744 × 10 4 ) ( Figure 3 ) . YU144369 also showed measurable heat of binding , however , protein precipitation during the experiment render these results inconclusive ( data not shown ) . E ﬃ cacy of YU142670 in Live Cells . We next explored the e ﬀ ect of these compounds in living cells . Preliminary experiments revealed that YU144369 ( Class II ) had an acute toxicity on cell cultures . Thus , we focused our analysis on YU142670 ( Class I ) , which shows speci ﬁ city toward OCRL and INPP5B . Cells defective in OCRL function have been previously reported to exhibit enhanced actin nucleation due to accumulation of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , 21 − 23 which is a critical factor for the recruitment of actin nucleating proteins to membranes . 24 Thus , we examined whether inhibition of OCRL / INPP5B by YU142670 had an impact on the organization of the actin cytoskeleton . Toward this aim , we expressed an F - actin reporter , CH Utrophin - mCherry , 25 in wild - type human skin ﬁ broblasts and we assessed actin dynamics by live cell confocal microscopy upon addition of YU142670 . This compound was used at a concentration which was approximately 50 fold higher than the biochemically measured IC50 ( pilot experiments showed this concentration did not produce obvious toxicity ) to account for potentially incomplete cell penetration of the compound ( although lower concentrations of compound did produce a measurable e ﬀ ect , data not shown ) . Addition of YU142670 in 0 . 5 % DMSO , but not 0 . 5 % DMSO alone , produced , within minutes , an accumulation of F - actin foci at the plasma membrane ( Figure 4a and b ) . The number of foci increased over 12 - fold in the presence of YU142670 compared with DMSO controls ( Figure 4c − e ) . Many of them developed into dynamic ru ﬄ es or ﬁ lopodia ( Figure 4f ) . The localization of these foci at PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 rich sites was con ﬁ rmed at the same sites by the increase of ﬂ uorescence signal for the co - expressed GFP - PH PLC δ , a PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 biosensor . It remains unclear whether GFP - PH PLC δ hot spots represent a focal accumulation of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 or a change in membrane geometry induced by actin nucleation , as membrane ru ﬄ es / folds result in increased membrane associated signal in the optic path . To further con ﬁ rm the e ﬀ ects of YU142670 on the 5 - phosphatase catalytic activity of OCRL in cells , we utilized an optogenetic method that allows us to monitor selectively this activity . 26 The method is based on the blue light dependent heterodimerization of a “ bait ” module ( CIBN - CAAX ) targeted to the plasma membrane and a light - sensitive cryptochrome module ( CRY2 ) fused to the 5 - phosphatase domain of OCRL ( CRY2 - 5 - ptaseOCRL ) . Blue - light illumination causes rapid and reversible binding of CRY2 - 5 - ptaseOCRL to CIBN , thus recruiting the 5 - phosphatase to the plasma membrane where it will convert its substrate lipid PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 to PI4P . This change can be monitored by the loss of plasma membrane associated ﬂ uorescence using iRFP - PH - PLC δ 1 , as a PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 reporter . 26 ACS Chemical Biology Articles dx . doi . org / 10 . 1021 / cb500161z | ACS Chem . Biol . 2014 , 9 , 1359 − 1368 1363 COS - 7 cells expressing CRY2 - 5 - ptaseOCRL , CIBN - CAAX and iRFP - PH - PLC δ 1 were imaged with TIRF microscopy . In control cells , pre - incubated for 15 min with 0 . 5 % DMSO , blue - light illumination ( 488 - nm , 50 pulses , 200 ms duration , 4 s intervals ) delivered through the evanescent ﬁ eld resulted in rapid ( t1 / 2 = 18 ± 3s , n = 14 cells ) and pronounced ( 52 ± 5 % , n = 14 cells ) loss of iRFP - PH - PLC δ 1 ﬂ uorescence , re ﬂ ecting primarily plasma membrane associated ﬂ uorescence ( Figure 5a ) . Interruption of the illumination resulted in redistribution of the biosensor back to the plasma membrane ( t1 / 2 = 480 ± 50 s , n = 11 cells ) , indicating resynthesis of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . When the experiment was repeated in the presence of 50 μ M YU142670 ( Figure 5b ) , blue - light illumination still caused a rapid ( t1 / 2 = 25 ± 4 s , n = 14 cells ) drop in plasma membrane iRFP - PH - PLC δ 1 ﬂ uorescence , but this drop was less pronounced ( 32 ± 3 % , n = 14 cells , P < 0 . 001 ) . Furthermore , interruption of the illumination resulted in a faster recovery of plasma membrane iRFP - PH - PLC δ 1 ﬂ uorescence ( t1 / 2 = 180 ± 23 s , n = 13 cells , P < 0 . 001 ) relative to controls , indicating that resynthesis of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 was accelerated compared to control cells . This is consistent with an inhibition of endogenous OCRL . Finally , we examined the impact of YU142670 on endogenous phosphoinositide levels in human dermal ﬁ bro - blasts after 3 H - myo - inositol labeling and HPLC analysis of phosphoinositide species . Following a 1 h treatment with 50 μ M YU142670 , increased levels of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , leading to an increased PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 / PI4P ratio , was observed ( see Figure 6a for two representative traces and Figure 6b for average ratios ) . In samples treated with YU142670 ( n = 6 ) the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 / PI4P ratio increased 50 % ( p value of 0 . 0004 ) ( Figure 6B ) . All other phosphoinositide levels measured remained unchanged ( Figure 6a ) In conclusion , in three separate assay systems , we observe changes in the cortical cytoskeleton , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 biosensor signal , and endogenous PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels that are consistent with a speci ﬁ c action of this compound on OCRL / INPP5B activity . Concluding Remarks . Here , we describe an e ﬃ cient method for high - throughput screening of modulators of the inositol 5 - phosphatases , and identify a small molecule inhibitor for OCRL and INPP5B . The identi ﬁ cation of the ﬁ rst compound with selective activity toward OCRL / INPP5B exempli ﬁ es the power of our screening strategy . This inhibitor has modest e ﬃ cacy , and thus this study is a starting point for the design and selection of more potent inhibitors . Our strategy utilized three separate assays formats : a ﬂ uorescence polarization assay which was highly sensitive but could be biased by compound interference , a much less sensitive malachite green assay , and a mobility shift assay which separated the reaction product from the compound , thus removing artifacts due to compound interference . We leveraged the malachite green and mobility shift assays to detect e ﬀ ects of substrate composition on compound e ﬃ cacy . In addition , we tested representative members of major structural sub - classes among the 5 - phosphatases , thus gaining knowledge of speci ﬁ city and selectivity , useful information toward reducing potential o ﬀ - target e ﬀ ects . Importantly , the assays employed in this study could be applied to other phosphoinositide phosphorylating and dephosphorylating enzymes . We focused our primary screen on Synaptojanin 1 and OCRL , and identi ﬁ ed two sca ﬀ olds with distinct speci ﬁ city pro ﬁ les . The ﬁ rst sca ﬀ old was speci ﬁ c for OCRL / INPP5B , with no activity against the other 5 - phosphatases tested in this study . A representative compound from this class ( YU142670 ) increased the levels of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in mouse embryonic ﬁ broblasts or human dermal ﬁ broblasts and inhibited the activity of over - expressed human OCRL in Cos - 7 cells . ITC experiments veri ﬁ ed a direct interaction between YU142670 and the catalytic domain of INPP5B . This compound inhibited reactions utilizing all substrates of OCRL and INPP5B , irrespective of lipid chain length or phosphorylation of the 3 ′ position of the inositol ring . Given its e ﬀ ects in cells , it is also inhibitory when OCRL / INPP5B acts on the membrane bilayer . It will be interesting to determine how this compound inhibits enzyme activity , as it likely hits a unique feature of OCRL / INPP5B not present in other 5 - Figure 3 .

Biol . 2014 , 9 , 1359 − 1368 1365 phosphatases . Conversely , the second class of compounds inhibited all 5 - phosphatases tested and displayed signi ﬁ cant cellular toxicity ( data not shown ) . Modulators of the inositol 5 - phosphatases could have diverse applications , both in basic research and in the clinic . Phosphoinositide metabolism is often targeted by pathogens . 27 OCRL and INPP5B reside on the earliest endocytic compart - ments , 28 and their activity is important , for example , in phagosome maturation , 29 a mechanism by which pathogens can gain entry . Accordingly , the regulation of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( and therefore actin polymerization ) by OCRL and INPP5B has been implicated in the infectivity of several pathogens , although the speci ﬁ c requirements of OCRL / INPP5B activity varies with the pathogen studied . Depletion of OCRL / INPP5B activity has been linked to a reduction in the inclusion formation of chlamydiae . 30 Similarly , in a genome - wide RNAi screen in Listeria monocytogenes , knockdown of OCRL led to decreased entry , reduced vaculor escape , and less intracellular growth . 31 The catalytic activity of OCRL and INPP5B has also been implicated in Yersinia invasion . 32 Thus , the inhibition of OCRL / INPP5B may be of bene ﬁ t in protection against pathogen entry . Concerning other 5 - phosphatases , it was reported that decreased levels of synaptojanin 1 , a condition that impacts neuronal PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , may have a protective e ﬀ ect on nervous tissue impairment in a mouse model of Alzheimer ’ s disease . 33 , 34 Furthermore , a chronic steady state decrease of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels ( due to enhanced expression of synaptojanin 1 ) may cooperate with the enhanced expression of the A β peptide precursor , Figure 5 .

This could be of bene ﬁ t , for instance , in the treatment of selected cases of Lowe Syndrome due to destabilizing missense mutations in OCRL that may be rescued by chemical chaperones . More importantly , an activator of OCRL / INPP5B might allow for better compensation of OCRL function by INPP5B , and thus some alleviation of symptoms . Additionally , as PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 pools controlled by di ﬀ erent 5 - phosphatases partially overlap , impaired function of a 5 - phosphatase could be partially rescued by the activation of others . In summary , our strategy utilizes the major structural classes of this enzyme family , and provides a means for testing substrate selectivity . Additionally , we have identi ﬁ ed two novel inhibitor classes that could serve as a starting point for the design of more pharmacologically desirable inhibitors . ■ METHODS Fluorescence Polarization Assay . Enzyme ( 10 μ L ) ( see SI Table 2 for ﬁ nal enzyme concentrations ) and 10 μ L of PI ( 3 , 4 5 ) P 3 lipid substrate were added to the assay plate ( ﬁ nal concentration of 2 . 5 μ M substrate ) . The reaction was stopped by adding 10 μ L of detection mix ( 50 nM GST - TAPP1 , 10 nM GloPIPs BODIPY TMR - PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 , 20 mM EDTA , ﬁ nal assay concentrations ) . Fluorescence polarization was read on an Envision plate reader ( PerkinElmer ) at 531 / 595 nm excitation / emission . Malachite Green Assay . Enzyme ( 10 μ L ) ( see SI Table 2 for ﬁ nal enzyme concentrations ) and 10 μ L of PI ( 4 5 ) P 2 lipid substrate were added to the assay plate ( ﬁ nal 25 μ M substrate ) . The reaction was stopped by adding 40 μ L of malachite green solution + 0 . 01 % w / v Tween20 . Absorbance was read on an Envision plate reader ( PerkinElmer ) at 620 nm . Mobility Shift Assay . Enzyme ( 10 μ L ) ( see SI Table 2 for ﬁ nal enzyme concentrations ) and 10 μ L of PI ( 3 , 4 5 ) P 3 - ﬂ uorescein substrate were added to the assay plate ( ﬁ nal concentration of 1 μ M ) . Assay plates were incubated for 30 min at RT for hit pick assays , see SI Table 2 for conditions for dose response curves . The reaction was stopped by adding 1 μ L of 500 mM EDTA using a MultiChannel Pipettor and heating to 65 ° C for 10 min . The shift in electrophoretic mobility caused by removal of the phosphate group from the ﬂ uorescent substrate was detected using a LabChip EZReader ( Caliper LifeSciences ) . The percent conversion of substrate to product for each well is calculated from the relative heights of the substrate and product peaks . ■ ASSOCIATED CONTENT * S Supporting Information Additional tables and ﬁ gures , detailed methods for protein puri ﬁ cation , assay conditions ( including a table summarizing all of the reaction conditions used for dose response ) , methods for isothermal titration calorimetry and cellular assays .
