Here , we report 21 the biochemical characterization of human cytoskeletal  – actin carrying mutation E334Q , a mutation 22 that leads to a hitherto unspecified non – muscle actinopathy . Following expression , purification , and 23 removal of linker and thymosin β4 tag sequences , the p . E334Q monomers show normal integration 24 into linear and branched actin filaments . The mutation does not affect thermal stability , actin filament 25 nucleation , elongation and turnover . Model building and normal mode analysis predict significant 26 differences in the interaction of p . E334Q – filaments with myosin motors and members of the 27 ADF / cofilin family of actin – binding proteins . Assays probing the interactions of p . E334Q – filaments with 28 human class 2 and class 5 myosin motor constructs show significant reductions in sliding velocity and 29 actin – affinity . E334Q differentially affects cofilin - mediated actin dynamics by increasing the rate of 30 cofilin - mediated de novo nucleation of actin filaments and decreasing the efficiency of cofilin - mediated 31 filament severing . Thus , it is likely that p . E334Q - mediated changes in myosin motor activity , as well as 32 filament turnover contribute to the observed disease phenotype . 33 34 35 3 Introduction 36 Cytoskeletal β – and  – actin are the basic building blocks of the actin cytoskeleton in human non – 37 muscle cells . The spatio – temporal regulation of these two actin isoforms , mediated by distinct actin – 38 binding proteins ( ABPs ) , drives the establishment and maintenance of specialized cytoskeletal 39 compartments that are defined by their network architecture and the presence of specific filamentous 40 actin – associated proteins ( Pollard , 2016 ; Plastino & Blanchoin , 2019 ) . The regulated ATP – dependent 41 turnover of these actin networks as well as the coordinated interplay of actin with network – specific 42 ABPs contribute to essential cellular processes like directed migration , adhesion , division and 43 mechanotransduction ( Ponti et al , 2004 ; Abercrombie et al , 1970 , 1971 ; Ridley et al , 2003 ; Pollard et 44 al , 2002 ; Lauffenburger & Horwitz , 1996 ) . 45 β – and  – actin differ by only four amino acids in the N – terminal region of the molecule but show 46 isoform – specific spatial organization in studies performed with monoclonal antibodies . In motile and 47 stationary cells , β – actin is found in contractile stress fibers and the cell periphery ( Dugina et al , 2009 ; 48 Latham et al , 2013 ; Dugina et al , 2015 ) . In contrast ,  – actin localization is less static . During cell 49 movement ,  – actin is recruited to the leading edge of the cell , resulting in an enrichment of the isoform 50 in the lamellipodium together with β – actin ( Dugina et al , 2009 ) . In non – moving cell states ,  – actin is 51 co – localized with β – actin in stress fibers ( Dugina et al , 2009 ) . In order to reconcile the highly similar 52 protein sequences with the varying localization , several hypotheses on isoform regulation were put 53 forward . These include the preferential interaction of ABPs with a particular isoform depending on the 54 minor differences in the protein sequence , post – translational modifications as a means of isoform – 55 specific regulation , and differences in the translation speed of ACTB and ACTG1 , the genes encoding 56 cytoskeletal β – actin and  – actin ( Zhang et al , 2010 ; Vedula et al , 2017 ; Pavlyk et al , 2018 ; Müller et al , 57 2013 ) . 58 Diseases associated with heterozygous pathogenic variants in ACTB and ACTG1 are typically referred 59 to as non – muscle actinopathies . These include a spectrum of rare syndromes that manifest themselves 60 as more or less pronounced developmental disorders in patients ( Verloes et al , 2015 ; Di Donato et al , 61 2014 ; Latham et al , 2018 ; Rivière et al , 2012 ; Baraitser & Winter , 1988 ; Cuvertino et al , 2017 ) . 62 Baraitser – Winter – Cerebrontofacial – Syndrome ( BWCFF , ( Baraitser & Winter , 1988 ) ) is a condition that 63 affects the development of multiple organs , but particularly results in facial anomalies and brain 64 malformations . BWCFF occurs due to various missense mutations in ACTB or ACTG1 ( Verloes et al , 65 2015 ; Di Donato et al , 2014 ; Rivière et al , 2012 ; Di Donato et al , 2016 ) . BWCFF – patients show a 66 recognizable facial gestalt , with variants in ACTB generally resulting in a stronger facial phenotype than 67 mutations in ACTG1 ( Di Donato et al , 2014 ) . BWCFF – patients regularly suffer from cortical 68 malformations that lead to severe developmental and mental impairments . In addition , symptoms 69 such as hearing loss , dystonia , hypotonia and polydactyly occur with increased frequency ( Di Donato 70 et al , 2014 ; Rivière et al , 2012 ) . Variants in ACTB alone are responsible for two other well – defined 71 syndromes . ACTB – associated pleiotropic malformation syndrome and ACTB – associated syndromic 72 thrombocytopenia can be caused by single – point missense mutations , truncating mutations , 73 frameshift mutations or deletion ( Latham et al , 2018 ; Cuvertino et al , 2017 ) . These ACTB – associated 74 syndromes differ from BWCFF in that they cause only mild craniofacial malformations and 75 developmental disorders ( Cuvertino et al , 2017 ; Latham et al , 2018 ) . Selected single – point missense 76 mutations in ACTG1 lead to a non – syndromic form of hearing loss ( Rendtorff et al , 2006 ; van Wijk et 77 al , 2003 ; Yuan et al , 2016 ) . 78 4 How exactly mutations in the ubiquitously produced actin isoforms of the cytoskeleton lead to various 79 syndromes and mutation - specific symptoms remains unclear . Currently , four main disease 80 mechanisms are under discussion ( Greve et al , 2022 ; Costa et al , 2004 ) . First , mutations in the actin 81 isoform can lead to functional haploinsufficiency , where the produced molecule is either intrinsically 82 unstable and therefore degraded by the proteasome or unable to associate with other actin molecules 83 and thus unable to partake in the necessary steps involved in the dynamic remodeling of the actin 84 cytoskeleton . This results in a reduced amount of “active“ actin molecules , which cannot fully be 85 compensated for by the remaining allele ( Vang et al , 2005 ) . Second , the mutant protein is produced in 86 normal quantities and integrated into filaments but interferes with actin filament turnover ( Costa et 87 al , 2004 ) . Third , the mutation perturbs interactions with actin binding proteins , either by direct or 88 allosteric disturbance of actin – actin or actin – ABP interaction interfaces ( Greve et al , 2022 ; Hundt et al , 89 2014 ; Bryan et al , 2006 ; Müller et al , 2012 ) . Fourth , the mutant protein shows an increased propensity 90 for forming toxic rod – like oligomeric structures , which can potentially harm the cell ( Ilkovski et al , 91 2004 ; Schröder et al , 2004 ) . 92 Therefore , one of the significant challenges is elucidating the relationship between the disturbed 93 molecular mechanisms of the cell ' s actin dynamics and disease patterns observed in patients . In order 94 to achieve this , it is necessary to resolve the structure – function relationship of the various actin 95 mutations at the molecular level . 96 Here , we report the biochemical characterization of p . E334Q , a cytoskeletal  – actin variant , which 97 causes a syndromic form of non – muscle actinopathy . Features associated with the production of 98 p . E334Q include mild facial anomalies and an abnormal gyral pattern of the cerebral cortex ( Di Donato 99 et al , 2016 ) . At four years ( age of diagnosis ) , a patient carrying this mutation showed developmental 100 delay and severe muscle hypotonia ( Di Donato et al , 2016 ) . Although the patient was initially reported 101 within the ACTG1 – associated BWCFF cohort , careful reassessment of the phenotype revealed that the 102 clinical phenotype cannot be classified as BWCFF and is therefore assigned as an unclassified NMA . 103 Structural analysis of the disease – causing mutation shows that residue E334 is located in the hinge 104 region of the actin molecule , which connects the two subdomain pairs of the protein . The region’s 105 flexibility and ability to act as a pivot point are essential for the subdomain rearrangement when actin 106 monomers polymerize into filaments ( Figure 1A ) . Furthermore , E334 is part of a contact region on the 107 F – actin surface that interacts with the so - called cardiomyopathy – loop in the motor domain of 108 cytoskeletal myosin isoforms and contributes to the formation of the actin – cofilin complex ( Figure 3 ) . 109 Here , we present experimental evidence for the impact of changes involving residue E334 with respect 110 to productive interactions with cytoskeletal myosin isoforms , actin polymerization dynamics , and the 111 formation of stable actin - cofilin complexes . We show that mutation E334Q does not adversely affect 112 protein folding . The thermal stability of p . E334Q resembles that of the wild – type protein , both as a 113 monomer and following integration into filaments . The mutant protein efficiently copolymerizes with 114 wildtype ( WT ) monomers and integrates into linear and branched filament networks . In contrast , the 115 interaction of mutant filaments with non - muscle myosin - 2A / C and myosin - 5A is strongly impaired , as 116 shown by in vitro motility experiments and solution kinetics . Furthermore , p . E334Q filaments are less 117 susceptible to cofilin – mediated disassembly , while monomers are more susceptible to cofilin – 118 mediated nucleation . 119 120 5 Results 121 Production of cytoskeletal  – actin and its variant p . E334Q 122 We produced untagged cytoskeletal  – actin and its variant p . E334Q in insect cells , free of 123 contaminating endogenous S . frugiperda actin , using a method that was originally designed for the 124 production of toxic actin mutants in Dictyostelium discoideum and later adapted for use with the 125 baculovirus / Sf9 insect cell expression system ( Noguchi et al , 2007 ; Lu et al , 2015 ) . The monomeric actin 126 constructs were initially produced fused to the actin - monomer sequestering protein thymosin - β4 . 127 Purification of the fusion protein by immobilized metal affinity chromatography , followed by 128 chymotrypsin – mediated cleavage of C – terminal linker and tag sequences , results in homogeneous 129 protein without non – native residues and native N - terminal processing , which includes cleavage of the 130 initial methionine and acetylation of the following glutamate . The method worked equally well for both 131 WT and mutant actin . Starting with 2 × 10 9 cells , typical yields ranged from 5 – 7 mg of purified protein 132 for cytoskeletal  – actin and p . E334Q ( N = 3 for WT and N = 4 for p . E334Q ) ( Figure 1 – figure supplement 133 1 ) . 134 135 Impact of mutation E334Q on protein folding and thermal stability 136 Mutation – induced misfolding of actin has been identified as one of the main causes for the 137 development of actinopathies ( Bryan et al , 2006 ; Vang et al , 2005 ) . Residue E334 is located in the hinge 138 region , formed by residues 137 – 145 and 333 – 338 ( Figure 1A ) , which is strongly involved in the 139 structural reorganization of the monomer upon incorporation into a growing filament ( Dominguez & 140 Holmes , 2011 ) . Previous studies have shown that an intact hinge region is crucial for the interactions 141 with the eukaryotic chaperonin CCT / TriC and myosin ( Noguchi et al , 2012 ; McCormack et al , 2001b , 142 2001a ) . We first performed a DNase – I inhibition assay to analyze the effect of mutation E334Q on the 143 folding of the protein . Previous studies have shown that the activity of DNase – I is only effectively 144 inhibited by correctly folded actin ( Schüler et al , 2000 ) . We observed a 10 % increase in the apparent 145 IC 50 – value of p . E334Q ( 25 . 7± 0 . 6 nM ) compared to the WT protein ( 22 . 7± 0 . 7 nM ) ( Figure 1B ) . This is 146 in good agreement with CD – spectroscopy results showing nearly identical secondary structure 147 compositions for WT and mutant proteins ( Figure 1 – figure supplement 2 ) . Thermal denaturation 148 temperatures ( T M ) analyzed by differential scanning fluorimetry ( DSF ) gave values of 56 . 77 ± 0 . 24°C 149 and 56 . 19 ± 0 . 30°C for monomeric WT actin and p . E334Q . The values obtained for WT and E334Q 150 filaments were 65 . 00 ± 0 . 76°C and 64 . 83 ± 0 . 25°C , respectively ( Figure 1C , Table 1 ) . Overall , these 151 results show that the mutant actin is correctly folded and has comparable stability to the WT protein . 152 As the hinge region is in close proximity to the nucleotide – binding cleft , we examined a potential effect 153 of the mutation on the interaction with nucleotides and the turnover of ATP . Initial tests gave near 154 identical rates of 0 . 00089 ± 0 . 00005 s - 1 and 0 . 00088 ± 0 . 00004 s - 1 for the steady – state turnover of ATP 155 by filaments formed from cytoskeletal  – actin or the p . E334Q variant ( Table 1 ) . Next , we determined 156 the nucleotide dissociation rates k - T and k - D by monitoring the decrease in fluorescence amplitude 157 associated with the displacement of ε – ATP or ε – ADP after rapid mixing with a large excess of unlabeled 158 ATP . With p . E334Q - actin , we observed rates of k - T = 0 . 0972 ± 0 . 0019 s - 1 and k - D = 0 . 3199 ± 0 . 0027 s - 1 . 159 These rates are about 2 - fold and 1 . 5 - fold faster than those observed in experiments performed with 160 WT monomers ( k - T = 0 . 0473 ± 0 . 0013 s - 1 , k - D = 0 . 2155 ± 0 . 0017 s - 1 ( Figure 1D , Table 1 ) . The observed 161 nucleotide dissociation rates for human cytoskeletal  – actin are in good agreement with values 162 6 obtained for a mixture of pyrene - labeled cytoskeletal  – actin ( 15 % ) and β – actin ( 85 % ) purified from 163 human platelets in experiments performed at the same ionic strength ( De La Cruz & Sept , 2010 ) . 164 165 p . E334Q shows normal polymerization behavior and is efficiently integrated into 166 linear and branched actin structures 167 The regulated assembly and disassembly of filamentous actin drive various cellular processes , including 168 directed cell migration , adhesion and endocytosis . A slight conformational change of the actin 169 monomer accompanies the integration of a monomeric actin molecule into a growing filament . A small 170 change in the hinge region leading to a 12° to 13° rotation of the inner subdomain pair relative to the 171 outer subdomain pair results in a flatter actin molecule within the filament compared to the free actin 172 monomer ( Dominguez & Holmes , 2011 ; Oda et al , 2009 ) . Mutations in the hinge region can thus 173 potentially affect filament assembly by impairing the required structural reorganization of the 174 monomer , as it attaches to the growing filament end . TIRF microscopy – based tracking of the 175 polymerization of monomeric Atto – 655 – labeled WT or mutant actin in vitro revealed a small but 176 significant reduction in the elongation rate from 12 . 6 ± 0 . 3 nm s - 1 for WT to 11 . 1 ± 0 . 3 nm s - 1 for mutant 177 filaments ( Figure 2A , B ) . To detect any differences in nucleation efficiency , we determined the time - 178 dependent increase in the number of filaments ( Figure 2C ) . Aside from short - term fluctuations , the 179 linear increase in the number of filaments recorded for WT ( 0 . 039 ± 0 . 002 s – 1 ) and p . E334Q ( 0 . 041 ± 180 0 . 004 s – 1 ) was similar over the full 1000 s duration of the experiment . Overall , p . E334Q shows only a 181 mild polymerization defect . 182 Since actin polymerization in vivo is tightly regulated in a spatio – temporal manner by different ABPs , 183 we analyzed the interaction of p . E334Q with one of the key – regulators of actin polymerization , the 184 Arp2 / 3 complex ( Goley & Welch , 2006 ) . The Arp2 / 3 complex promotes the nucleation of new actin 185 filaments from the sides of existing filaments and caps their pointed ends . Thereby , it promotes the 186 formation of branched actin networks and contributes to essential processes that depend on the 187 dynamic remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton , such as cell migration , endocytosis , and organelle 188 positioning ( Nicholson - Dykstra et al , 2005 ; Mullins et al , 1998 ; Blanchoin et al , 2000 ; Loisel et al , 1999 ) . 189 The ability of p . E334Q to form branched actin networks was probed in TIRF microscopy – based 190 experiments in the presence of increasing concentrations of VCA – activated human Arp2 / 3 complex 191 ( Figure 2D ) . At the lowest Arp2 / 3 concentration used ( 0 . 01 nM ) , we observed the appearance of the 192 first branches after approximately 250 s . In the presence of 0 . 1 nM and 0 . 2 nM of the VCA - activated 193 Arp2 / 3 complex , mutant and WT actin continued forming branched networks with comparable branch 194 formation and branch elongation rates . Similar results were obtained with WT actin , mutant actin or 195 with 1 : 1 mixtures of WT and mutant actin , when we analyzed the effect of adding increasing 196 concentrations of VCA – activated human Arp2 / 3 in pyrene – actin based bulk – polymerization assays 197 ( Figure 2E , F ) . The results are summarized in Table 1 . 198 199 Impact of E334Q mutation on interactions with ADF / cofilin family proteins 200 Homology models of the complexes formed by human cofilin – 1 with filamentous cytoskeletal  – actin 201 and p . E334Q were generated to evaluate the functional impact of mutation E334Q . Cofilin - 1 binds to 202 actin filaments by making simultaneous contact with two adjacent monomers . Actin residue E334 is 203 located halfway between two adjacent cofilin molecules , but only makes direct contact with residue 204 7 L111 of the cofilin – 1 molecule on the pointed end side ( Figure 3A ) . Cofilin – 1 residue L111 is located in 205 an  - helix ( L111 - L128 ) that is essential for actin – binding ( Pope et al , 2000 ) . Mutation E334Q maintains 206 the van der Waals interaction with L111 , but reduces the electrostatic attraction between the 207 interacting surfaces , with likely effects on the stability and allosteric coupling of the complex ( Figure 208 3B , C ) . 209 To evaluate the impact of mutation E334Q on the elastic properties of F – actin in the presence and 210 absence of cofilin – 1 binding , we performed normal mode analysis using bare , partially decorated and 211 fully decorated filaments ( ( Figure 3 , Figure 3 – figure supplement 1A ) . Since residue E334 is located 212 on the outer surface of the actin filament , the mutation produces no significant change in the normal 213 mode frequencies of bare filaments . Similarly , fully decorated filaments show only minor differences . 214 Substantial changes in the low - frequency modes associated with global conformational changes were 215 observed when comparing the partially cofilin - decorated filaments of WT and mutant filaments , where 216 the bare and cofilin – decorated regions move as rigid bodies and the interface between the two regions 217 acts as a hinge ( modes 7 , 8 ) or fulcrum ( mode 9 ) ( Figure 3 – figure supplement 1B ) . 218 To test the validity of our modeling results , we performed biochemical and functional assays probing 219 the interactions of human cofilin – 1 with monomeric and filamentous cytoskeletal  – actin and p . E334Q . 220 The effect of cofilin – 1 on filament assembly was assessed by TIRF microscopy experiments . The 221 polymerization of 1 µM actin was induced in the presence of 0 , 50 or 100 nM cofilin – 1 . Following an 222 initial lag phase of 200 to 300 seconds , the filament formation rate increased with the cofilin – 1 223 concentration ( Figure 4 ) . In experiments with p . E334Q - actin , de novo filament nucleation proceeded 224 faster ( Figure 4A , B ) . Movies showing filament formation by de novo nucleation in the presence of 225 cofilin - 1 are available in Figure 4 – video supplement 1 – 6 . 226 Next , we investigated the effect of cofilin – 1 on the disassembly of preformed cytoskeletal  – actin and 227 p . E334Q filaments . The effect of cofilin – 1 on existing WT and mutant filaments was initially tested by 228 performing pyrene – based dilution – induced disassembly experiments with actin filaments polymerized 229 for 16 hours and containing predominately ADP – actin . Cofilin – 1 has previously been shown to increase 230 the bulk – disassembly rate of actin in this experimental setup ( Breitsprecher et al , 2011 ; Greve et al , 231 2022 ) . In the absence of cofilin , the changes in pyrene – fluorescence are best described by single 232 exponential functions with k obs values of 0 . 0022 ± 0 . 0002 s - 1 and 0 . 0029 ± 0 . 0003 s - 1 for WT and p . E334Q 233 filaments , respectively ( Figure 5A , Figure 5 – figure supplement 1 ) . The addition of cofilin – 1 increased 234 the observed rate of the dilution – induced disassembly in a concentration – dependent manner for both 235 mutant and WT filaments . At the highest cofilin – 1 concentration used ( 40 nM ) , the change in pyrene – 236 fluorescence with p . E334Q filaments is still best described by a single exponential function with a k obs 237 value of 0 . 0059 ± 0 . 0008 s - 1 . In contrast , the change for WT filaments is best - fitted to a bi - exponential 238 function . Here , the k obs values for the fast and slow phases are 0 . 0163 ± 0 . 0028 s - 1 and 0 . 0002 ± 0 . 00003 239 s - 1 , respectively ( Figure 5A , Figure 5 – figure supplement 1 ) . Additional experiments with 240 heterofilaments showed milder but significant differences ( Table 1 ) . The observed rate constant values 241 were linearly dependent on the concentration of cofilin – 1 in the range 0 – 40 nM , with the slopes 242 corresponding to the apparent second – order rate constant ( k C ) for the cofilin - 1 induced 243 depolymerization of F – actin . In experiments performed with p . E334Q filaments , the value obtained for 244 k C was 4 . 2 - fold lower ( 0 . 81 × 10 - 4 ± 0 . 08 × 10 - 4 nM - 1 s - 1 ) compared to experiments with WT filaments 245 ( 3 . 42 × 10 - 4 ± 0 . 22 × 10 - 4 nM - 1 s - 1 ) . When heterofilaments were used , the effect of the mutation was 246 reduced to a 2 . 2 - fold difference compared to WT filaments ( 1 . 54 × 10 - 4 ± 0 . 11 × 10 - 4 nM - 1 s - 1 ) . 247 8 The pyrene - based bulk experiments show an evident change in the p . E334Q – cofilin interaction . 248 However , they cannot distinguish between cofilin – 1 binding defects and a disassembly efficiency 249 change . To analyze the perturbed interaction of p . E334Q with cofilin – 1 in more detail , we first 250 performed high - speed co – sedimentation assays with constant concentrations of F – actin ( 5 µM ) and 251 increasing concentrations of cofilin - 1 ( 0 . 0625 – 20 µM ) at pH 6 . 5 and pH 7 . 8 . Cofilin - 1 binds faster but 252 severs filaments less efficiently under slightly acidic pH conditions , whereas a weakly basic 253 environment favors cofilin – mediated severing ( Wioland et al , 2019 ) . We first performed experiments 254 at pH 6 . 5 . This endpoint experiment showed that cofilin – 1 binds to and disassembles p . E334Q and WT 255 filaments ( Figure 5B , C ) . Most pellet fractions from the experiments conducted with WT filaments were 256 found to contain less cofilin - 1 , as higher disassembly efficiency results in more cofilin – 1 being bound 257 to actin monomers and retained in the supernatant fraction . We repeated the experiment at pH 7 . 8 258 with an equimolar and a 2 – fold excess of cofilin , ( Figure 5B , C ) . In experiments with equimolar cofilin – 259 1 , we found significantly less WT actin in the pellet fraction than at pH 6 . 5 , consistent with a higher 260 disassembly – efficiency at pH 7 . 8 . The shift to pH 7 . 8 did not have the same enhancing effect on the 261 disassembly of p . E334Q filaments , as indicated by an increase of p . E334Q actin in the pellet fraction . 262 The endpoint measurements show that cofilin – 1 binds to p . E334Q filaments but severs them less 263 efficiently . Next , we performed fluorescence quench experiments with pyrene - labeled WT and 264 p . E334Q filaments , as it was previously shown that cofilin - 1 efficiently quenches the fluorescence of 265 pyrene - labeled actin filaments ( Blanchoin & Pollard , 1999 ; De La Cruz , 2005 ) . We determined the 266 change in fluorescence amplitude when 2 µM pyrene - labeled p . E334Q or WT filaments were mixed 267 with increasing concentrations of cofilin - 1 . Fitting a quadratic equation to the obtained experimental 268 values gave only slightly different dissociation equilibrium constants of K D , p . E334Q = 1 . 83 ± 0 . 13 µM and 269 K D , WT = 1 . 61 ± 0 . 07 µM ( Figure 5D ) . These K D values are in the range of values previously determined 270 for muscle α - actin filaments ( Blanchoin & Pollard , 1999 ; De La Cruz , 2005 ) , actin filaments from 271 Acanthamoeba castellanii ( Blanchoin & Pollard , 1999 ) and filaments containing a mixture of human  – 272 an d β – actin ( De La Cruz , 2005 ) using the same method . 273 To better understand the underlying changes leading to the differences in cofilin – mediated filament 274 disassembly efficiency , we performed two – color TIRF microscopy experiments using Atto – 655 labeled 275 WT or mutant filaments and eGFP – cofilin – 1 . This setup allows us to observe the binding of eGFP – 276 cofilin – 1 to individual filaments and the resulting disassembly of the filaments in real – time . eGFP – 277 cofilin – 1 was shown to bind to actin filaments and disassemble actin as efficiently as WT cofilin – 1 278 ( Wioland et al , 2019 , 2017 ; Breitsprecher et al , 2011 ) . Immediately after mixing 300 nM “aged” actin 279 filaments , capped at their barbed end by human capping protein ( CP ) , with 100 nM eGFP – cofilin – 1 , 280 the reaction mixture was flushed into a flow – chamber and imaging was started . The delay between 281 mixing and the start of imaging was approximately 15 seconds for each sample . At the end of the 282 experimental dead time , almost twice as many cofilin clusters had formed in the field of view on WT 283 filaments ( 151 ± 29 ) as on p . E334Q filaments ( 82 ± 6 ) ( Figure 6A ) , the number of both WT and mutant 284 actin filaments had doubled from initially about 95 to about 200 filaments ( Figure 6B ) , and the Atto – 285 655 fluorescence of the WT filaments had decreased to 30 % of the starting value , whereas the Atto – 286 655 fluorescence of p . E334Q filaments remained unchanged ( Figure 6C ) . During the following 500 s , 287 total eGFP - cofilin - 1 fluorescence increased linearly , with the rate of increase being approximately 288 twice as fast for WT as for p . E334Q filaments ( Figure 6D ) . While the total eGFP - cofilin - 1 fluorescence 289 in the presence of p . E334Q filaments continued to increase linearly over the next 1000 seconds , the 290 signal for WT filaments began to saturate and reached a plateau value ( Figure 6D ) . The number of 291 cofilin clusters on WT filaments decreased steadily during the observation period of 1500 s . In contrast , 292 9 their number increased in the presence of p . E334Q filaments , reaching a maximum after 500 s , 293 followed by a plateau of 400 s and a subsequent slow decrease ( Figure 6A ) . The changes in the number 294 of actin filaments showed similar time dependencies , a steady decrease for WT filaments and an initial 295 increase for p . E334Q filaments followed immediately by a linear decrease without an intervening 296 plateau phase ( Figure 6B ) . For WT and p . E334Q filaments , the size of eGFP – cofilin – 1 clusters on the 297 steadily shrinking filaments expanded continuously until either severing occurred or the actin filament 298 was fully decorated . No severing events were observed with fully decorated filaments . 299 300 Impact of E334Q mutation on interactions with myosin family proteins 301 The precise nature of the six actin - binding elements in the myosin motor domain varies considerably 302 among myosin isoforms ( Sellers , 2000 ; Cope et al , 1996 ) . The associated sequences have conserved 303 hydrophobic and electrostatic properties , variations of which contribute to the tuning of kinetic and 304 functional properties . Actin residue E334 interacts with a positively charged patch in the 305 cardiomyopathy loop ( CM – loop ) of the myosin upper 50 kDa domain of NM2C and Myo5A ( Pospich et 306 al , 2021 ; Von Der Ecken et al , 2016 ) . In the case of NM2C , the electrostatic interaction of E334 with 307 K429 in the CM – loop is further stabilized by van der Waals interactions with I420 and V427 ( Figure 7 ) . 308 A lysine residue corresponding to K429 in NM2C is present in all human myosin – 2 and myosin – 5 309 isoforms . During force - generating interactions with mutant actin filaments , the weakening of 310 complementary electrostatic interactions in this region of the actomyosin interface is likely to 311 attenuate the binding affinity of class 2 and 5 myosins as well as the coupling between their actin and 312 nucleotide binding sites . 313 Cytoskeletal  – actin filaments move with an average sliding velocity of 195 . 3 ± 5 . 0 nm s – 1 on lawns of 314 surface immobilized NM2A – HMM molecules ( Figure 8A , B ) . For NM2A - HMM densities below about 315 10 , 000 molecules per μm 2 , the average sliding speed for cytoskeletal actin filaments drops steeply 316 ( Hundt et al , 2016 ) . Filaments formed by p . E334Q actin move 5 - fold slower , resulting in an observed 317 average sliding velocity of 39 . 1 ± 3 . 2 nm / s . Filaments copolymerized from a 1 : 1 mixture of WT and 318 p . E334Q actin move with an average sliding velocity of 131 . 2 ± 10 nm s – 1 ( Figure 8A , B ) . When equal 319 densities of surface - attached WT and mutant filaments were used , we observed that the number of 320 rapid dissociation and association events increased markedly for p . E334Q filaments ( Figure 8 – video 321 supplement 7 – 9 ) . 322 Using a NADH - coupled enzymatic assay , we determined the ability of p . E334Q and WT filaments to 323 activate the ATPase of NM2A - HMM over the range of 0 - 25 µM F - actin ( Figure 8C ) . While we observed 324 no significant difference in K app , indicated by the actin concentration at half - maximal activation , in 325 experiments with p . E334Q filaments ( 2 . 89 ± 0 . 49 µM ) and WT filaments ( 3 . 20 ± 0 . 74 µM ) , we observed 326 a 28 % slower maximal ATP turnover at saturating actin concentration ( k cat ) with p . E334Q filaments 327 ( 0 . 076 ± 0 . 005 s - 1 vs . 0 . 097 ± 0 . 002 s - 1 ) . To investigate the impact of the mutation on actomyosin – 328 affinity using transient – kinetic approaches , we determined the dissociation rate constants using a 329 single – headed NM2A – 2R construct ( Figure 8D ) . NM2A – 2R is a constitutively active motor – domain 330 construct generated by fusing the motor – domain of NM2A to two spectrin – like repeats serving as a 331 rigid lever arm extension ( Anson et al , 1996 ) . The construct is ideally suited for the kinetic 332 characterization of the NM2 – isoforms ( Heissler & Manstein , 2011 ) . The dissociation rate constant k - A 333 is 5 . 6 – fold increased from 0 . 08 × 10 - 3 s – 1 to 0 . 45 × 10 - 3 s – 1 for NM2A – 2R when p . E334Q filaments are 334 used . A similar change from 0 . 31 × 10 - 3 s – 1 to 1 . 70 × 10 - 3 s – 1 was observed for the analogous NM2C – 2R 335 10 construct ( Figure 8 – figure supplement 1 ) . Next , we determined the affinities of NM2A – 2R for WT and 336 p . E334Q filaments in the absence of nucleotide ( K A ) and the presence of saturating concentrations of 337 ADP ( K DA ) . We performed affinity – titration experiments with pyrene – labeled , phalloidin – stabilized 338 filaments and NM2A – 2R ( Kurzawa & Geeves , 1996 ) . The values measured under rigor conditions show 339 a 9 . 9 - fold reduced affinity of NM2A – 2R for p . E334Q filaments ( K A = 16 . 9 ± 1 . 3 nM ) compared to WT 340 filaments ( K A = 1 . 7 ± 0 . 3 nM ) ( Figure 8E ) . When the experiment was performed in the presence of 341 saturating concentrations of ADP , we obtained values for K DA of 353 . 0 ± 20 . 6 nM in the presence of 342 p . E334Q filaments and 122 . 6 ± 11 . 4 nM with WT filaments ( Figure 8F ) . The apparent ATP – affinity 343 ( 1 / K 1 ) , the maximal dissociation rate of NM2A from F - actin in the presence of ATP ( k + 2 ) , and the 344 apparent second - order rate constant of ATP binding ( K 1 k + 2 ) showed no significant differences for 345 complexes formed between NM2A and WT or p . E334Q filaments ( Table 1 , Figure 8 – figure 346 supplement 3 ) . 347 Next , we investigated the effects of the E334Q mutation on the motile activity of the processive motor 348 Myo5A ( Figure 9 ) . Since the lysine residue corresponding to K429 in the CM loop of NM2C is also 349 present in all human myosin 5 isoforms , the resulting changes in binding strength and thermodynamic 350 coupling are expected to reduce the motor activity of Myo5A upon interactions with p . E334Q 351 filaments . Structural studies have shown that the interaction between actin residue E334 and the CM - 352 loop in the Myo5A motor domain is maintained from the rigor to the ADP – bound state ( Pospich et al , 353 2021 ) . We performed unloaded in vitro motility assays to evaluate the effect of the mutation on the 354 interaction with Myo5A – HMM . The rapid transition from weak to strong binding with a slow and rate - 355 limiting ADP release leading to a high working ratio ( De La Cruz et al , 1999 ) allows the in vitro motility 356 assay to be performed on surfaces with a low motor density . In initial experiments , we found a Myo5A – 357 HMM surface density of 770 molecules µm – 2 to be optimal for experiments with WT filaments . This 358 much lower optimal motor surface density compared to the NM2A - HMM construct , which requires 359 densities above 10 , 000 molecules per μm 2 , is a manifestation of the processive properties of the 360 Myo5A – HMM construct . Movement was steady and filament breaks were practically non – existent at 361 770 molecules µm – 2 , while higher surface densities led to increased filament breaks , resulting in rapid 362 fragmentation . At all Myo5A – HMM surface densities used , the sliding velocity was significantly 363 reduced for p . E334Q compared to WT filaments . In experiments with p . E334Q filaments , a 4 - fold 364 higher Myo5A – HMM surface density was required to achieve a similar actin surface decoration and 365 optimal motile activity . Furthermore , filament breaks occurred less frequently , indicating a weaker 366 actomyosin interaction . The number of moving filaments and their sliding velocity decreased sharply 367 below surface densities of 770 molecules µm - 2 for WT filaments and 3100 molecules µm – 2 for p . E334Q 368 filaments . Below a surface density of 380 Myo5A – HMM molecules µm – 2 , no productive attachment 369 events were observed with p . E334Q filaments . Thus , mutation E334Q in cytoskeletal − actin leads to 370 an impairment of the interaction of the actin filament with Myo5A , similar to the changes observed 371 with NM2A and NM2C , but with additional manifestations specific to processive motors . 372 373 Discussion 374 At present , the exact pathogenesis of non - muscular actinopathies remains poorly understood . A 375 rigorous molecular characterization of the contribution of disturbances in actin dynamics , contractility 376 and transport processes is necessary to develop an understanding of the diverse disease patterns . 377 11 In the past , the functional characterization of disease – associated mutations in cytoskeletal − actin 378 focused on mutations p . T89I , p . K118N / M , p . E241K , p . T278I , p . P264L , p . P332A , and p . V370A , which all 379 cause non – syndromic hearing loss . Two mutants showed abnormal polymerization behavior , indicated 380 by a reduced polymerization rate ( p . V370A ) ( Bryan et al , 2006 ) or an increased propensity for bundle 381 formation ( p . E241K ) ( Morín et al , 2009 ) . The mutants p . K118N / M showed a perturbed interaction with 382 the Arp2 / 3 complex , reducing branching efficiency ( Kruth & Rubenstein , 2012 ; Jepsen et al , 2016 ) . A 383 significantly reduced protein stability was observed for two mutant proteins ( p . P264L , p . P332A ) ( Bryan 384 et al , 2006 ) . Perturbed interactions with cofilin were observed for a range of mutations . p . T89I , 385 p . E241K , p . T278I , and p . V370A are characterized by an increased sensitivity to cofilin – mediated 386 filament severing ( Bryan & Rubenstein , 2009 ) . Interestingly , mutation p . P332A , close to the analyzed 387 mutation p . E334Q , enhances resistance towards cofilin − mediated severing ( Bryan & Rubenstein , 388 2009 ) . The perturbed cofilin interaction is the only overlap between the spectrum of molecular 389 phenotypes observed for syndromic deafness − associated mutations and mutation p . E334Q , which 390 results in a non − syndromic actinopathy . It has to be noted that all cited studies relied on the use of 391 actin purified from budding yeast for their biochemical studies , which shows 91 % sequence identity to 392 human cytoskeletal − actin ( Ng & Abelson , 1980 ) . 393 Here , we describe mutation E334Q in cytoskeletal  – actin that leads to a syndromic actinopathy with 394 hypotonia and is not associated with non – syndromic hearing loss . Our biochemical analysis shows that 395 the mutation does not affect the folding of the actin monomer or the stability of the monomer and the 396 resulting filaments , demonstrating that mutations in the hinge region do not necessarily affect protein 397 stability . The mutant protein displays a robust interaction with the VCA - activated Arp2 / 3 complex . Its 398 polymerization kinetics are equivalent to those of the WT protein , with which it effectively 399 copolymerizes in vitro . Based on these observations , we exclude functional haploinsufficiency as a 400 potential disease mechanism and favor a mechanism in which p . E334Q integrates into the cytoskeletal 401 actin networks of the cell but shows defects in the interaction with key binding partners . Consistent 402 with this hypothesis and based on several structural studies ( Pospich et al , 2021 ; Behrmann et al , 2012 ; 403 Robert - Paganin et al , 2021 ; Risi et al , 2021 ; Fujii & Namba , 2017 ; Gyimesi et al , 2020 ; Gong et al , 2022 ; 404 Gurel et al , 2017 ; Von Der Ecken et al , 2016 ) as well as our initial modeling of complexes formed by 405 p . E334Q – filaments , we observed perturbed interactions with cofilin – 1 and human cytoskeletal myosin 406 isoforms NM2A , NM2C and Myo5A ( Table 1 ) . 407 We interpret the observed changes in the interaction with NM2A , NM2C and Myo5A to primarily 408 reflect the weakening of complementary interactions between actin residue E334 and a core contact 409 triad in the myosin CM – loop , which in the case of NM2C consists of K429 and hydrophobic residues 410 I420 and V427 ( Figure 7 ) . Analogous changes in the interaction of mutant filaments with Myo1D , 411 Myo1G , NM2B , Myo5B , Myo5C and Myo19 are expected due to the presence of the core contact triad 412 residues in their CM – loops ( Figure 7B ) . In contrast , the absence of a basic residue corresponding to 413 K429 in NM2C and additional changes affecting their CM loop structure make it difficult to predict the 414 consequences for the interaction of p . E334Q – filaments with the cytoskeletal myosin isoforms Myo1A , 415 Myo1C , Myo1E , Myo1F , Myo3A , Myo3B , Myo15 , Myo18A , Myo18B and Myo19 . 416 In addition to primary consequences , reflected in the observed changes in the binding interactions 417 with NM2A and cofilin – 1 , our results point to significant changes that result from allosteric 418 perturbations . The results from our transient – kinetic analysis of the complexes formed by p . E334Q 419 with NM2A – 2R indicate that reduced allosteric coupling between the actin and nucleotide binding sites 420 within the myosin motor domain contributes to the observed decrease in motor activity . The coupling 421 12 efficiency is given by the ratio of the dissociation equilibrium constants for actin binding in the absence 422 ( K A ) and presence of ADP ( K DA ) . The value for K DA / K D obtained for the interaction of NM2A – 2R in the 423 presence of p . E334Q ( 20 . 9 ) is 3 . 5 – fold lower than the value measured in the presence of WT actin 424 ( Table 1 ) . Allosteric perturbations are also major contributors mediating the impact of mutation E334Q 425 to the changes in elastic properties and the rate of actin filament disassembly in the presence of cofilin – 426 1 . Our results are consistent with the E334Q mutation slowing the initial complex formation due to less 427 favorable charge interactions and allosteric perturbations having a major impact on subsequent steps . 428 Patients carrying mutations in ACTB or ACTG1 predominately suffer from developmental disabilities , 429 which can be directly linked to cortical malformations of varying severity . Therefore , neuronal cells 430 and / or neuronal progenitor cells are assumed to be the most affected cell population in the patients 431 ( Verloes et al , 2015 ; Di Donato et al , 2016 ; Rivière et al , 2012 ) . The actin composition of the neuron is 432 thought to reach ratios between 1 : 1 and 1 : 2 for − actin to β − actin in the mature state after fluctuations 433 during neuronal development ( Cheever & Ervasti , 2013 ) . Studies of the spatial localization of the 434 cytoskeletal actin isoforms in the mature neuron are contradictory . A study showing that β − and 435 − actin strongly colocalize in hippocampal and cerebral neurons ( Cheever et al , 2012 ) appears to 436 contradict previous studies , which reported spatial enrichment of β − actin in dynamic structures such 437 as the dendritic spine and exclusion from less dynamic structures such as the axon shaft , where − actin 438 was found to be enriched ( Weinberger et al , 1996 ; Micheva et al , 1998 ; Bassell et al , 1998 ) . Based on 439 our results , we conclude that p . E334Q actin is readily produced and integrated into the cytoskeletal 440 actin networks of neuronal cells , where it perturbs interactions with cytoskeletal myosin isoforms that 441 play essential roles in the function and maintenance of healthy neurons . The functions of myosin - 5 442 isoforms in neuronal cells are all linked to their role as actin barbed - end directed processive cargo 443 transporters ( Hammer & Wagner , 2013 ) . Several of the myosin - 5 driven transport - processes are 444 important contributors to synaptic plasticity , i . e . the ability of the neurons to change synaptic strength 445 based on previous activities ( Hammer & Wagner , 2013 ) . 446 The different NM2 isoforms are found in a wide range of cell types in the brain , but they show varying 447 spatial expressions ( Murakami & Elzinga , 1992 ; Golomb et al , 2004 ; Rochlin et al , 1995 ; Kawamoto & 448 Adelstein , 1991 ) . NM2A is predominately enriched in the vasculature of the brain , consistent with the 449 importance of NM2A for angiogenesis ( Ma et al , 2020 ) . NM2B and NM2C are mainly found in growth 450 cones and dendritic spines of neuronal cells ( Murakami & Elzinga , 1992 ; Golomb et al , 2004 ; Rochlin et 451 al , 1995 ) . NM2 isoforms are known to contribute to various neuronal processes , but unlike for Myo5A , 452 their exact role is less well understood . NM2B was shown to determine the maturation and 453 morphology of the dendritic spines in hippocampal neurons and was additionally linked to basal 454 synaptic function and plasticity ( Hodges et al , 2011 ; Ma et al , 2004 ; Rex et al , 2010 ) . NM2C and NM2B 455 contribute to the differentiation of oligodendrocytes ( Domingues et al , 2020 ) . The NM2 isoforms 456 compete with proteins of the ADF / cofilin family for binding to F – actin and this competition is essential 457 for stable actomyosin contractility and an intact cell cortex ( Wiggan et al , 2012 ) . 458 In line with this , ADF / cofilin family members are highly abundant in growth cones and dendritic spines 459 and essential for spine morphology and determination of spine length by modulating actin turnover 460 ( Star et al , 2002 ; Hotulainen et al , 2009 ; Namme et al , 2021 ) . Cofilin - mediated severing and nucleation 461 were previously proposed to synergistically contribute to global actin turnover in cells 462 ( Andrianantoandro & Pollard , 2006 ; Du & Frieden , 1998 ) . Our results show that the mutation affects 463 these different cofilin functions in actin dynamics in opposite ways . Cofilin - mediated filament 464 nucleation is more efficient for p . E334Q monomers , while cofilin - mediated severing of filaments 465 13 containing p . E334Q is significantly reduced . The interaction of both actin monomers and actin 466 filaments with ADF / cofilin proteins involves several distinct overlapping reactions . In the case of actin 467 filaments , cofilin binding is followed by structural modification of the filament , severing and 468 depolymerizing the filament ( De La Cruz & Sept , 2010 ) . Cofilin binding to monomeric actin is followed 469 by the closure of the nucleotide cleft and the formation of sta bilized “ long - pitch ” actin dimers , which 470 stimulate nucleation ( Andrianantoandro & Pollard , 2006 ) . 471 While the number of disease – associated mutations reported for ACTB and ACTG1 is steadily increasing , 472 the total number of patients affected remains low compared to patients with disease – associated 473 mutations in muscle actin isoforms ( Parker et al , 2020 ) . High sequence and structure conservation 474 across all actin isoforms enable us to extrapolate our findings obtained with cytoskeletal  – actin to 475 diseases associated with mutations of E334 in other actin isoforms . Mutations of residue E334 in α – 476 skeletal actin ( encoded by ACTA1 ) are reported to result in nemaline myopathy ( E334K , ( Laing et al , 477 2009 ) ) or core myopathy ( E334A , ( Kaindl et al , 2004 ) ) ( reviewed in ( Parker et al , 2020 ) ) . The mutations 478 either lead to the inversion of the charge at residue 334 ( E334K ) or the complete loss of charge ( E334A ) . 479 Our study shows that loss of charge at actin residue 334 leads to the loss of a conserved core contact 480 between actin and the myosin motor domain of cytoskeletal class 2 myosin . Skeletal muscle myosin – 2 481 is a central component of the sarcomere . The myosin forms the thick filaments that interact with the 482 thin filaments formed by actin and regulatory proteins , generating force that powers muscle 483 contraction ( Sweeney & Hammers , 2018 ) . Because the core contact triad that interacts with actin 484 residue E334 is present in all class 2 myosin isoforms , it is reasonable to assume that mutations of 485 residue E334 in α - skeletal actin affect the interaction with skeletal muscle myosin 2 to a similar extent , 486 resulting in less efficient force generation and thereby contributing to the development of myopathy 487 in patients . 488 Interestingly , a recent study analyzing the prevalence of cytoskeletal actin mutations in cancer using 489 the cBioPortal database found that mutations in ACTB and ACTG1 are associated with lymphoid 490 cancers , specifically mutations in ACTB with diffuse large B – cell lymphoma and mutations in ACTG1 491 with multiple myeloma . When the authors extended the analysis to all cancer types , they found that 492 the observed mutations in the two genes were scattered across the entire actin sequence , with no 493 apparent preference for a particular region . Nevertheless , the group identified residue E334 in ACTB 494 as a potential hotspot , as the missense variants p . E334Q / p . E334K are more frequent in all analyzed 495 datasets ( Witjes et al , 2020 ) . In this paper , we investigated the impact of the E334Q exchange on the 496 function of cytoskeletal  – actin in the context of developmental diseases . However , the high sequence 497 similarity between the cytoskeletal actin isoforms makes it highly likely that the E334Q mutation in 498 cytoskeletal β – actin results in similar molecular perturbations of actin dynamics but with potentially 499 different consequences for the organism due to varying enrichment of the two isoforms in functional 500 compartments of the actin cytoskeleton . Although future studies are needed to determine the role of 501 ACTB and ACTG1 mutations as driver or passenger mutations in different cancers , our data show a 502 possible link between impaired cytoskeletal actomyosin dynamics , cofilin – mediated actin turnover and 503 cancer development . 504 505 Material and Methods 506 Plasmids 507 14 The coding sequence of human cytoskeletal  – actin ( Uniprot - ID : P63261 ) was fused via a C – terminal 508 linker to a His 6 – tagged thymosin β4 moiety ( Uniprot - ID : P62328 ) , as previously described for yeast 509 actin ( Uniprot - ID : P60010 ) ( Noguchi et al , 2007 ) . The fusion protein was cloned into the multiple 510 cloning site of the pFastBac – Dual vector under the control of the polyhedrin promotor . The plasmid 511 encoding the mutant protein p . E334Q was generated by performing site - directed mutagenesis on the 512 WT plasmid . Motor domain carrying fragments of human NM2A , NM2C , and Myo5A were produced 513 using MYH9 , MYH14 , and MYO5A heavy chain sequences , respectively ( Uniprot - IDs : P35579 , Q7Z406 , 514 Q9Y4I1 ) . For the production of HMM - like constructs of human NM2A and human Myo5A , expression 515 vectors derived from pFastBac were used , as described previously ( Hundt et al , 2016 ; Reindl et al , 516 2022 ) . NM2A – HMM was co – produced with human light chains MYL6a ( Uniprot - ID : P60660 ) and 517 MYL12b ( Uniprot - ID : O14950 ) . Myo5A HMM was co – produced with human calmodulin ( Uniprot - ID : 518 P0DP23 ) . NM2A – 2R and NM2C – 2R , single – headed , constitutively active motor domain constructs of 519 human NM2A and NM2C – 2C0 with an artificial lever arm region , were produced using pFastBac – 520 derived expression vectors , as described previously ( Heissler & Manstein , 2011 ; Müller et al , 2013 ) . 521 Human cofilin – 1 ( Uniprot - ID : P23528 ) was cloned into the expression vector pGEX – 6P – 2 ( Greve et al , 522 2022 ) . The human Arp2 / 3 complex consisting of subunits Arp2 ( Uniprot - ID : P61160 ) , Arp3 ( Uniprot - ID : 523 P61158 ) , ArpC1B ( Uniprot - ID : O15143 , ArpC2 ( Uniprot - ID : O15144 ) , ArpC3A ( Uniprot - ID : O15145 ) , 524 ArpC4 ( Uniprot - ID : P59998 ) , ArpC5 ( Uniprot - ID : O15511 ) and a C – terminal FLAG tag on ArpC3A was 525 produced using the expression vector pBIG2abc , provided by Roberto Dominguez ( University of 526 Pennsylvania , Philadelphia , USA ) . The VCA domain of human N – WASP ( Uniprot - ID : O00401 ) was 527 cloned into pGEX – 6P – 2 . Human capping protein ( subunits α1 / β2 , Uniprot - ID : P52907 / P47756 ) in pET – 528 Duet – 1 and eGFP – tagged human cofilin – 1 ( Uniprot - ID : P23528 ) in pGEX – 6P – 2 vector were provided 529 by Jan Faix ( Medizinische Hochschule Hannover , Hannover , Germany ) . Recombinant bacmids and 530 viruses for the production of proteins in the Sf9 system were produced according to the Bac – to – Bac 531 baculovirus expression system protocol ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA , USA ) . 532 533 Protein production and purification 534 We produced recombinant human cytoskeletal  – actin and p . E334Q mutant protein as actin – thymosin 535 β4 – His 6 fusion protein using the baculovirus / S . frugiperda insect cell expression system . The C - terminal 536 native actin residue is a Phe , which provides a cleavage site for chymotrypsin to remove downstream 537 tag sequences completely . The tag sequence employed consists of a 14 - amino acid linker 538 ( ASSGGSGSGGSGGA ) , 43 thymosin - β4 residues , followed by 6 histidine residues . To produce WT and 539 mutant fusion proteins , 2×10 9 cells were harvested 72 hours after infection . Cells were pelleted , 540 washed with PBS , shock frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at – 80 °C . Cell pellets from two liters of 541 Sf – 9 culture were thawed for a typical preparation . For lysis , cells were resuspended in lysis buffer – A 542 ( 10 mM Tris pH 7 . 8 , 5 mM CaCl 2 , 10 mM imidazole , 1 . 25 % Triton X – 100 , 100 mM KCl , 7 mM  – 543 mercaptoethanol , 1 mM ATP , 1 mM PMSF , 100 μg / mL TAME , 80 μg / mL TPCK , 2 μg / mL pepstatin , 5 544 μg / mL leupeptin ) and sonicated . The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 30 , 000 × g ( 30 min , 4°C ) . 545 The cleared lysate was loaded onto 3 mL equilibrated PureCube 100 NiNTA agarose ( Cube Biotech , 546 Manheim am Rhein , Germany ) and incubated for two hours under constant rotation . Afterwards , the 547 material was washed extensively with 10 mM Tris pH 7 . 8 , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 10 mM imidazole , 50 mM KCl , 548 1 mM ATP and the actin – thymosin β4 fusion protein was eluted with 10 mM Tris pH 7 . 8 , 250 mM 549 imidazole , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM ATP . Peak fractions were pooled and dialyzed overnight against G – 550 buffer ( 10 mM Tris pH 7 . 8 , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 1 mM ATP , 0 . 5 mM DTT ) . The next day , protein aggregates 551 15 were removed by centrifugation at 15 , 000 × g ( 20 min , 4 °C ) . The supernatant was pooled and α – 552 chymotrypsin ( Sigma - Aldrich , Schnelldorf , Germany ) was added at a w / w ratio of 1 : 300 553 ( chymotrypsin : actin ) to remove the tag - sequences . The optimal digestion time varied from 45 to 80 554 min and needs to be determined for each batch of α – chymotrypsin . PMSF was added to a final 555 concentration of 0 . 2 mM to stop the digestion . Actin was separated from the thymosin - His tag using 556 polymerization - depolymerization steps . Unless otherwise stated , all protein purification steps were 557 carried out at 4°C . F - actin was stored on ice . G - actin was concentrated to approximately 150 µM , flash 558 frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at – 80°C in G – buffer . Clarified G - actin , free of aggregates and 559 oligomers , was always prepared fresh . G - actin stocks were thawed , diluted in G - buffer to the 560 appropriate concentration , and centrifuged at 136 , 000 × g ( 15 min , 4°C ) . The top 2 / 3 of the centrifuged 561 sample was carefully removed for use in further experiments . All myosin constructs were produced in 562 the baculovirus / S . frugiperda insect cell expression system and purified as previously described for 563 NM2A – HMM ( Greve et al , 2022 ; Hundt et al , 2016 ; Pathan - Chhatbar et al , 2018 ) , Myo5A – HMM ( Reindl 564 et al , 2022 ) , the single – headed , constitutively active constructs NM2A – 2R ( Heissler & Manstein , 2011 ; 565 Müller et al , 2013 ) and NM2C – 2R ( Heissler & Manstein , 2011 ; Müller et al , 2013 ) . Production of the 566 human Arp2 / 3 complex in insect cells followed the procedure described in Zimmet et al . ( Zimmet et al , 567 2020 ) . Human cofilin – 1 and human eGFP – cofilin – 1 were produced as GST – fusion proteins in Rosetta2 568 ( DE3 ) cells . Purification was carried out as previously described for human cofilin – 1 ( Greve et al , 2022 ) . 569 Human GST – N – WASP – VCA was produced in ArcticExpress ( DE3 ) cells . The cells were lysed by 570 treatment with lysozyme followed by sonification in lysis buffer – W ( 25 mM Tris pH 7 . 4 , 50 mM NaCl , 571 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM DTT , 0 . 5 % Triton X – 100 , 1 mM PMSF ) . The cleared cell lysate was loaded onto a 572 self – packed GSH – Sepharose column . The column was then washed with five column volumes of wash 573 buffer – W ( 25 mM TRIS pH 7 . 4 , 50 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM DTT ) . GST – N – WASP – VCA was eluted 574 from the column by applying 10 mM glutathione in wash buffer – W . The eluted protein was 575 concentrated and loaded onto a S75 16 / 600 size exclusion chromatography column ( GE Healthcare , 576 Chicago , USA ) . After chromatography , fractions containing pure protein were pooled , concentrated 577 and the concentration was determined via absorbance at 280 nm . The GST – N – WASP – VCA protein was 578 frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at – 80°C . 579 Human capping protein ( α1 / β2 ) carrying a 6×His – tag was produced in Rosetta2 ( DE3 ) cells . For 580 purification , cells were lysed by lysozyme followed by sonification in lysis buffer - CP ( 25 mM Tris pH 7 . 8 , 581 250 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM PMSF , 1 . 5 % Triton X – 100 , 10 mM imidazole , 7 mM beta – 582 mercaptoethanol ) . The cleared lysate was loaded onto PureCube 100 NiNTA agarose ( Cube Biotech , 583 Monheim am Rhein , Germany ) in a gravity – flow column . The agarose was washed with wash buffer – 584 CP ( 25 mM Tris pH 7 . 8 , 250 mM NaCl , 30 mM imidazole ) and the protein was then eluted with elution 585 buffer – CP ( 25 mM Tris pH 7 . 8 , 50 mM NaCl , 250 mM imidazole ) . Fractions with pure capping protein 586 were pooled , concentrated and loaded onto a S200 16 / 600 size exclusion chromatography column ( GE 587 Healthcare , Chicago , USA ) . The purified protein was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at – 80°C . 588  – skeletal actin ( Uniprot - ID : P68139 ) was prepared from chicken pectoralis major muscle , as 589 previously described for rabbit  – skeletal actin ( Lehrer & Kerwar , 1972 ) . 590 Unless otherwise stated , all purification steps were performed at 4°C . 591 592 DNase – I inhibition assay , DSF and nucleotide exchange assay 593 16 The DNase – I inhibition assay and DSF to study actin folding and thermal stability were performed as 594 previously described ( Greve et al , 2022 ) . 595 Nucleotide exchange experiments were performed with freshly clarified G – actin as follows . The G – 596 actin solution was pas sed through a Zeba™ spin desalting column ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , 597 MA , USA ) equilibrated with G – buffer to remove excess nucleotide . The sample was then incubated 598 with a 2 – fold excess of ε – ATP or ε – ADP ( Jena Bioscience , Jena , Germany ) for two hours on ice . After 599 incubation , excess nucleotide was removed by passing the sample through a Zeba™ spin desalting 600 column equilibrated with 10 mM TRIS pH 8 . 0 and 10 µM ε – ATP / ε – ADP . The concentration of the Ca 2 + – 601 ε – ATP / ε – ADP – G – actin solution was determined using the Coomassie protein assay ( Thermo Fisher 602 Scientific , Waltham , MA , USA ) . Prior to the nucleotide exchange experiment the Ca 2 + – ε – ATP / ε – ADP – 603 G – actin solution was supplemented with 10× Mg 2 + - exchange buffer ( 1 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM EGTA ) to a 604 final concentration of 0 . 1 mM MgCl 2 and 1 mM EGTA . The resulting solution was rapidly mixed 1 : 1 with 605 assay buffer – SF containing excess unlabeled ATP ( 10 mM TRIS pH 7 . 8 , 0 . 2 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM ATP ) 606 using a HiTech Scientific SF61 stopped – flow system ( TgK Scientific Limited , Bradford on Avon , UK ) . The 607 ε – ATP / ε – ADP fluorescence was excited at 335 nm and monitored through a KV389 cut – off filter . The 608 displacement of the fluorescent nucleotide analogs by ATP results in a decrease in the fluorescence 609 amplitude , which is best described by a single exponential fit that yields the apparent rate of nucleotide 610 dissociation 611 CD spectroscopy 612 Directly prior to the measurement , the freshly clarified G - actin was diluted to 0 . 05 mg / mL in 10 mM 613 phosphate buffer pH 7 . 4 . A buffer reference was prepared by mixing G buffer with 10 mM phosphate 614 buffer pH 7 . 4 in the same ratio . CD spectroscopy was performed with a PiStar 180 spectrometer 615 ( Applied Photophysics , Leatherhead , UK ) . Measurements were performed at 25°C using quartz 616 cuvettes ( 0 . 3 cm path length ) and nitrogen purging . CD spectra were recorded from 176 nm to 280 nm 617 in steps of 1 nm using a bandwidth of 4 nm . For every sample , three spectra were recorded and 618 subsequently averaged . The averaged buffer spectrum was subtracted , and the resulting protein 619 spectrum smoothed using a Savitsky – Golay filter ( Savitzky & Golay , 1964 ) in two consecutive iterations . 620 The DichroWeb online platform was used to determine the secondary structure composition 621 ( Whitmore & Wallace , 2004 ) . Data were analyzed based on the mean residue ellipticity [ 𝜃 ] MRE of the 622 sample using the CDSSTR algorithm and reference set 3 ( optimized for 185 nm – 240 nm ) . 623 624 Steady – state ATPase assay 625 The steady – state ATPase activity of F – actin was measured using a NADH – coupled enzymatic assay 626 ( Furch et al , 1998 ) . Experiments were performed with 10 µM F – actin at 37 °C in assay buffer – A ( 25 mM 627 HEPES pH 7 . 3 , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 50 mM KCl , 0 . 5 mM DTT ) supplemented with the enzymatic system , which 628 generates the quantifiable readout ( 1 mM ATP , 0 . 5 mM NADH , 0 . 5 mM 2 – phosphoenolpyruvate , 0 . 02 629 mg / mL lactate dehydrogenase from rabbit muscle ( Sigma - Aldrich , Schnelldorf , Germany ) , 0 . 05 mg / mL 630 pyruvate kinase from rabbit muscle ( Sigma - Aldrich , Schnelldorf , Germany ) , 0 . 5 mM NADH ) . For 631 measurements of the basal and actin – activated NM2A – HMM ATPase , 0 . 5 µM MLCK - treated HMM was 632 used . Phalloidin – stabilized WT or mutant F - actin was added over the range of 0 – 25 µM . The change in 633 absorbance at 340 nm due to oxidation of NADH was recorded in a Multiskan FC Microplate 634 Photometer ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA , USA ) . The data were fitted to the Michaelis - 635 17 Menten equation to obtain values for the actin concentration at half - maximal activation of ATP - 636 turnover ( K app ) and for the maximum ATP - turnover at saturated actin concentration ( k cat ) . 637 638 TIRF microscopy – based assays 639 To distinguish between the impact of the mutation on filament nucleation and elongation , we 640 performed TIRF microscopy – based assays using freshly clarified protein . Unlabeled WT or mutant G – 641 actin was supplemented with 10 % Atto – 655 labeled WT or mutant G – actin for visualization of the 642 filament assembly process . Glass coverslips were cleaned , surfaces chemically treated and flow cells 643 assembled as described previously ( Greve et al , 2022 ) . To induce polymerization , the G – actin solutions 644 were diluted to a final concentration of 1 µM with 2× TIRF – buffer ( 20 mM imidazole , 50 mM KCl , 1 mM 645 MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 15 mM glucose , 20 mM β – ME , 0 . 25 % methylcellulose , 0 . 1 mg / mL 646 glucose oxidase and 0 . 02 mg / mL catalase . The solutions were mixed , immediately flushed into flow 647 cells and image acquisition was started . 648 To follow filament disassembly , two – color TIRF experiments with Atto – 655 labeled actin and eGFP – 649 cofilin – 1 were performed with preformed filaments that were “aged” and capped at their barb ed end 650 by human capping protein . WT or mutant actin was polymerized for 3 hours at room temperature and 651 then moved to 4 °C overnight . “Aged” F – actin and human capping protein were diluted into TIRF – 652 buffer to generate capped actin filaments . eGFP – cofilin – 1 was added to final concentrations of 300 nM 653 F – actin , 25 nM capping protein and 100 nM eGFP – cofilin – 1 . Immediately adding eGFP – cofilin – 1 , the 654 reaction mixture was flushed into the flow cell and image acquisition was started . Images were 655 captured using a Nikon Eclipse TI – E inverted microscope equipped with a 100× / 1 . 49 NA Apo oil 656 immersion objective and Ixon3 897 EMCCD cameras ( Andor , Belfast , UK ) under control of the NIS 657 software ( Nikon , Minato , Japan ) . Images were taken every 3 seconds with an exposure time of 60 ms . 658 To analyze actin polymerization in the presence of ABPs , the ABPs were first pre – diluted in KMEI buffer 659 and diluted to their final concentration in TIRF buffer just before adding actin . Image acquisition was 660 performed as described for experiments with actin only . Image analysis for all TIRF microscopy 661 experiments was performed using ImageJ ( Rueden et al , 2017 ) . The elongation rate of actin filaments 662 was determined by manually tracking individual filaments . Only filaments that could be tracked for at 663 least four consecutive minutes were used to determine the elongation rate . Using these criteria , 20 to 664 30 filaments were tracked in each individual experiment ( in a microscopic field of view of 81 . 41 × 665 81 . 41 µm ) . For quantification of two – color TIRFM – experiments , 52 × 52 µm ROIs from the entire 666 microscopic field of view were used . The number of filaments observed throughout an experiment was 667 determined using the Analyze Particle tool in ImageJ after background – subtraction ( sliding paraboloid , 668 rolling ball radius : 25 pixels ) . 669 670 Unloaded in vitro motility assay 671 The unloaded in vitro motility assay to study the interaction between WT and mutant actin and NM2A – 672 HMM or Myo5A – HMM was essentially performed as previously described ( Greve et al , 2022 ; Reindl et 673 al , 2022 ; Kron & Spudich , 1986 ) . Flow cells used in the in vitro motility assay were constructed using 674 nitrocellulose – coated coverslips . NM2A – HMM requires phosphorylation of the associated regulatory 675 light chain for full enzymatic activity . Purified NM2A – HMM was incubated with the GST – tagged kinase 676 domain ( residues 1425 - 1776 ) of human smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase ( Uniprot - ID : 677 18 A0A8I5KU53 ) at a molar ratio of 10 : 1 in 25 mM MOPS , pH 7 . 3 , 50 mM KCl , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM CaCl 2 , 678 0 . 2 µM calmodulin , 3 µM regulatory light chain ( MLC12b ) , 3 µM essential light chain ( MLC6a ) , 1 mM 679 DTT and 1 mM ATP for 30 minutes at 30 °C . In experiments with Myo5A – HMM , each buffer and actin 680 solution was supplemented with 2 μM calmodulin to prevent calmodulin dissociation from Myo5A – 681 HMM . Olympus IX70 or Olympus IX83 inverted fluorescence microscopes ( Olympus , Hamburg , 682 Germany ) equipped with a 60× / 1 . 49 NA PlanApo oil immersion objective and an Orca Flash 4 . 0 CMOS 683 camera ( Hamamatsu Photonics Deutschland GmbH , Herrsching , Germany ) were used for image 684 acquisition . All in vitro motility experiments were performed at a 37°C . Analysis of the recorded image 685 series was performed in ImageJ ( Rueden et al , 2017 ) . The Plugin wrmTrck ( Nussbaum - Krammer et al , 686 2015 ) , developed by Jesper S . Pedersen , was used to determine the trajectories and corresponding 687 velocities of the individual actin filaments . Only filaments that showed movement for at least 30 688 consecutive seconds were tracked and used to determine the average sliding velocity . 689 690 Pyrene – actin based bulk – polymerization assays 691 The polymerization and depolymerization of pyrene – labeled recombinant WT or mutant actin ( 5 % 692 pyrene - labeled WT or mutant actin ) was monitored as a function of increasing or decreasing pyrene – 693 fluorescence using a Synergy 4™ microplate reader ( BioTek Instruments , Winooski , VT , USA ) and the 694 built – in filter set ( Excitation : 340 / 30 nm , Emission : 400 / 30 nm ) at 25 °C . For polymerization 695 experiments , 20 µL of a 10 µM solution of pyrene – labeled Mg 2 + – ATP – G – actin ( WT or mutant ) was 696 placed in a black flat bottom 96 – well plate ( BrandTech Scientific , USA ) . 80 µL of 1 . 25 × polymerization 697 buffer ( 10 mM TRIS , pH 7 . 8 , 100 mM KCl , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 5 mM EGTA , 0 . 1 mM DTT and 0 . 1 mM ATP ) 698 was added to the wells using the built – in pipetting function of the plate reader and the polymerization 699 of actin was followed as an increase in pyrene – fluorescence . For depolymerization experiments , 3 µL 700 of a 20 µM F – actin solution was placed in one well of the plate . The solution was rapidly diluted by the 701 addition of 297 µL G – buffer . The depolymerization of the filaments was monitored as a decrease in 702 pyrene – fluorescence . 703 The effects of Arp2 / 3 ( + GST – N – WASP – VCA ) and cofilin – 1 on filament assembly or disassembly were 704 analyzed by dispensing the actin solution and the ABP solution into the well by hand without mixing . 705 Polymerization buffer or G – buffer was added , the reaction components were thereby mixed and 706 recording of the ensuing changes in fluorescence intensity was started . 707 The bulk – polymerization rate was determined according to Doolittle et al . ( Doolittle et al , 2013 ) . A 708 linear regression was fitted to the linear region around the time – point of half – maximal fluorescence . 709 The depolymerization experiments were evaluated by fitting a single exponential function to the data , 710 including a linear component that accounts for bleaching . 711 712 Co – sedimentation experiments 713 Actin was polymerized at 20 μM for 3 hours at room temperature before being moved to 4 °C 714 overnight . For co – sedimentation experiments at pH 7 . 8 , 5 μM of “aged” F – actin and varying 715 concentrations of human cofilin – 1 were mixed in assay buffer – C ( 10 mM TRIS , pH 7 . 8 , 100 mM KCl , 5 716 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 5 mM EGTA , 0 . 1 mM DTT and 0 . 1 mM ATP ) to a final volume of 50 μL in 1 . 5 mL 717 polypropylene centrifuge tubes ( Beckman Coulter , Brea , CA , USA ) suited for high – speed centrifugation . 718 For experiments performed at pH 6 . 5 , assay buffer – C was supplemented with piperazine – N , N′ – bis ( 2 – 719 19 ethanesulfonic acid ) ( PIPES , pH 6 . 5 ) to a final concentration of 100 mM to induce a pH shift from 7 . 8 720 to 6 . 5 . Actin and cofilin – 1 were added after the pH shift . Samples were incubated for 10 minutes at 721 23°C and then centrifuged at 136 , 000 × g ( 15 min , 4°C ) . The pellet and supernatant fractions were 722 subjected to SDS – PAGE and the gel was imaged at a ChemiDoc – MP – gel documentation system ( Bio – 723 Rad Laboratories , Hercule , CA , USA ) . The amount of actin and cofilin – 1 in the pellet and supernatant 724 was determined via densitometry using the Image Lab software ( Bio – Rad Laboratories , Hercule , CA , 725 USA ) . 726 727 Transient kinetic analysis of the actomyosin complex 728 Myosin binding to pyrene – labeled actin leads to strong pyrene – fluorescence quenching . Mixing of the 729 rigor – pyrene – acto – NM2A – 2R / NM2C – 2R complex with an excess of unlabeled actin allows the 730 determination of k - A ( dissociation rate of myosin from F – actin in the absence of nucleotide ) . Prior to 731 the experiment , pyrene – labeled phalloidin – stabilized WT or mutant F – actin and the myosin solutions 732 were treated with apyrase ( Merck KGaA , Darmstadt , Germany ) to remove residual nucleotide . Pyrene – 733 labeled actin was mixed with a 1 . 5 – fold excess of NM2A – 2R / NM2C – 2R in assay buffer – P ( 20 mM MOPS 734 pH 7 . 0 , 100 mM KCl , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM DTT ) and incubated for 5 minutes on ice . The solution was 735 mixed with an excess of chicken  – skeletal actin in assay buffer – P to final concentrations of 0 . 5 μM 736 pyrene – labeled actin , 0 . 75 μM NM2A – 2R and 5 μM  – skeletal actin . The solution was immediately 737 transferred into the well of a black 96 – well microplate with a transparent bottom and a lid ( Corning , 738 Corning , NY , USA ) . Fluorescence was excited at 365 nm and measured at 407 nm in a CLARIOstar Plus 739 microplate reader ( BMG LABTECH , Offenburg , Germany ) using bottom optics over 9 hours . The 740 dissociation rate ( k - A ) of myosin from actin was determined by applying a single – exponential fit to the 741 data . 742 The apparent affinity of NM2A – 2R to WT or mutant F – actin in the absence ( K A ) or presence ( K DA ) of 743 nucleotide was determined using the method developed by Kurzawa and Geeves ( Kurzawa & Geeves , 744 1996 ) . To determine K A , all protein samples were treated with apyrase before the experiment . 100 nM 745 pyrene – labeled phalloidin – stabilized F – actin was incubated with increasing concentrations of NM2A – 746 2R ( 10 – 1 , 300 nM ) for 5 minutes on ice in assay buffer – P without DTT . The solutions were shot against 747 20 µM ATP at a HiTech Scientific SF61 stopped – flow system ( TgK Scientific Limited , Bradford on Avon , 748 UK ) in a 1 : 1 ratio at 20 °C . Fluorescence was excited at 365 nm and recorded using a KV389 cut – off 749 filter . At least five transients were averaged for each concentration of NM2A – 2R and fitted using a 750 single – exponential function . The relative fluorescence amplitudes were plotted against the pre – mix 751 myosin concentrations . The affinity was determined by applying a quadratic equation to the dataset , 752 where A is the amplitude , A max the amplitude under saturation , [ F – actin ] the actin concentration prior 753 mix , [ NM2A – 2R ] the variable NM2A – 2R concentration and K the dissociation constant in the absence 754 or presence of nucleotide . 755 A = A max × ( [ F − Actin ] + [ NM2A − 2R ] + 𝐾 ) − √ ( [ F − Actin ] + [ NM2A − 2R ] + 𝐾 ) 2 − 4 × [ F − Actin ] × [ NM2A − 2R ] 2 × [ F − Actin ] 756 757 Slight modifications of the experimental protocol were necessary to determine K DA . Incubation with 758 apyrase was omitted , instead the pyrene – actomyosin complex was incubated with 30 µM ADP ( Merck 759 KGaA , Darmstadt , Germany ) for 20 minutes on ice prior to measurement . To account for the lower 760 affinity in the presence of ADP , the range of used myosin concentrations was extended up to 3 , 000 761 20 nM . Additionally , the concentration of ATP in the mixing experiment was increased to 300 µM pre – 762 mix . Data was recorded and evaluated as done for experiments without nucleotide . 763 The apparent ATP – affinity of the actomyosin complex was determined by mixing the apyrase – treated , 764 pyrene – labeled , phalloidin – stabilized actomyosin complex with increasing concentrations of ATP at 765 the stopped – flow system . Fitting an exponential function to the individual transients yields the ATP – 766 dependent dissociation rate of NM2A – 2R from F – actin ( k obs ) . The k obs – values were plotted against the 767 corresponding ATP concentrations and a hyperbola was fitted to the data . The fit yields the apparent 768 ATP – affinity ( 1 / K 1 ) of the actomyosin complex and the maximal dissociation rate k + 2 . The apparent 769 second – order rate constant for ATP binding ( K 1 k + 2 ) was determined by applying a linear fit to the data 770 obtained at low ATP concentrations ( 0 – 25 µM ) . 771 772 Molecular modelling 773 Homology models of human cytoskeletal  – actin , human cofilin – 1 and the human NM2A motor 774 domain were generated with MODELLER ( Sali & Blundell , 1993 ) . Models of filamentous human 775 cytoskeletal  – actin with bound cofilin – 1 or NM2A motor domain were generated based on cryo – EM 776 structures obtained from the Protein Data Bank of the barbed end side of a cofilactin cluster ( pdb : 777 6UC4 , 6UBY , 6VAO ) ( Huehn et al , 2020 ) and a human cytoplasmic actomyosin complex ( pdb : 5JLH ) 778 ( Von Der Ecken et al , 2016 ) . The structures were accessed on May 25 , 2023 . Mutation E334Q was 779 introduced using the mutagenesis tool in PyMOL ( Schrödinger , LLC , 2015 ) . PyMOL and ChimeraX 780 ( Goddard et al , 2018 ; Pettersen et al , 2021 ) were used for distance measurements and visualization of 781 Coulomb surfaces . 782 Identification and alignment of the CM – loop region of cytoskeletal myosin isoforms were performed 783 using the match function of ChimeraX , by superimposing and aligning cytoskeletal myosin isoform 784 structures on NM2C ( pdb - NM2C : 5JLH , pdb - Myo5A : 7PM5 , pdb - Myo5C : 5HMP , pdb - Myo1D : AF - 785 O94832 - F1 , pdb - Myo15 : 7UDT , pdb - Myo19 : AF - Q96H55 - F1 ) . Where appropriate , the corresponding 786 human sequences were retrieved from UniProt and structurally aligned . 787 Normal mode analyses ( NMA ) were performed using the Elastic Network Model ( ENM ) elNémo ( Suhre 788 & Sanejouand , 2004 ) and an nrbl value of 5 . 789 790 Data Analysis 791 Data analysis and graph plotting were performed with Origin 2023 ( OriginLab Corporation . 792 Massachusetts , USA ) . Errors are given as standard deviation ( SD ) based on three independent 793 experiments if not otherwise specified .

The k - A values are the results of 5 – 11 individual experiments . 1449 1450 1451 1452 1453 1454 1455 53 1456 Figure 8 – figure supplement 3 . Analysis of the apparent ATP – affinity ( 1 / K 1 ) , the maximal ATP – 1457 induced dissociation rate of NM2A from actin ( k + 2 ) and the second - order rate constant for ATP 1458 binding ( K 1 k + 2 ) for complexes formed between NM2A - 2R and WT or p . E334Q filaments . ( A ) ATP - 1459 induced dissociation experiments with phalloidin – stabilized pyrene – labeled acto – NM2A – 2R 1460 complexes were performed as described in Material and Methods . A hyperbolic fit to the obtained 1461 data yields 1 / K 1 and k + 2 . Data is shown as the mean ± SD of six individual experiments . ( B ) A linear fit 1462 to the data obtained with low ATP concentrations ( 0 – 25 µM ) yields K 1 k + 2 . 1463
