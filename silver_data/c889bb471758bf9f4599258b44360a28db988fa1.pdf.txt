uilford ( 1962 ) hypothesized that creative indi - viduals possess divergent thinking abilities that traditional IQ tests do not measure , and other researchers have shown that creativity test scores , divergent thinking tasks , and creative achievement are independent from IQ ( e . g . , Getzels & Jackson , 1958 ; Gough , 1976 ; Guilford , 1950 ; Helson & Crutchfield , 1970 ; Helson & Crutchfield 1971 ; Herr , Moore , & Hansen , 1965 ; Rossman & Horn , 1972 ; Rotter , Langland & Berger , 1971 ; Torrance , 1977 ) . In seeming contrast , other research has shown a relationship between creativity test scores and IQ scores ( e . g . , Runco & Albert , 1986 ; Wallach , 1970 ) . However , many researchers agree with the threshold theory , which explains that creativity and intelligence are separate constructs ; that is , more intelligence does not nec - essarily mean greater creativity . Threshold theory assumes that , below a critical IQ level ( which is usually said to be about 120 ) , there is some correlation between IQ and cre - ative potential , and above it there is not ( Barron , 1961 ; Getzels & Jackson , 1962 ; Guilford , 1967 ; Guilford & Christensen , 1973 ; MacKinnon , 1961 , 1962 , 1967 ; Simonton , 1994 ; Walberg , 1988 ; Walberg & Herbig , 1991 ; Yamamoto , 1964 ) . Although threshold theory sup - poses that intelligence and creativity are related only up to an IQ of approximately 120 , investigations of the threshold theory have contradictory and inconclusive results ( e . g . , Runco & Albert , 1986 ) . This inconsistency may come from different measures of intelligence and cre - ativity and various features of samples , including gender , age , and socioeconomic status ( SES ) . Meta - analysis , or quantitative synthesis , attempts to find resolution of apparent conflicts in literature , to dis - cover consistencies and account variability in similarly appearing studies , and to identify core issues for future research ( Cooper & Hedges , 1994 ) . Thus , this study syn - thesized empirical research in the areas of creativity and intelligence for the purpose of creating a generalization about the relationship between creativity and intelligence . 57 The Journal of Secondary Gifted Education JSGE Vol . XVI , No . 2 / 3 , Winter / Spring 2005 , pp . 57 – 66 . Copyright ©2005 Prufrock Press , P . O . Box 8813 , Waco , TX 76714 Can Only Intelligent People Be Creative ? A Meta - Analysis Kyung Hee Kim Eastern Michigan University Some research has shown that creativity test scores are independent from IQ scores , whereas other research has shown a rela - tionship between the two . To clarify the cumulative evidence in this ﬁeld , a quantitative review of the relationship between creativity test scores and IQ scores was conducted . Moderating influences of IQ tests , IQ score levels , creativity tests , cre - ativity subscales , creativity test types , gender , age , and below and above the threshold ( IQ 120 ) were examined . Four hundred forty - seven correlation coefﬁcients from 21 studies and 45 , 880 participants were retrieved . The mean correlation coefﬁcient was small ( r = . 174 ; 95 % CI = . 165 – . 183 ) , but heterogeneous ; this correlation coefficient indicates that the relationship between creativity test scores and IQ scores is negligible . Age contributed to the relationship between intelligence and cre - ativity the most ; different creativity tests contributed to it secondly . This study does not support threshold theory . G The four primary purposes of this synthesis were to 1 . conduct a quantitative synthesis of correlations between IQ and creativity test scores ; 2 . compare the correlations between IQ and creativity scores for IQ above 120 with those for IQ below 120 to conﬁrm threshold theory ; 3 . identify some of the variables that moderate those cor - relations ( e . g . , IQ tests , different levels of IQ scores , creativity tests , creativity test types , creativity sub - scales , gender , and age ) ; and 4 . use the correlations derived from the quantitative syn - thesis to investigate models of the relationships between intelligence and creativity . Methods Literature Review More than 100 studies published from 1961 through the summer of 2004 were located from computer searches and personal retrieval within the body of English - language creativity and intelligence literature using Academic Search Premier , ERIC , PsycARTICLES , PsycINFO , and biblio - graphic searches of each reference . IQ , creativity , intelli - gence , and threshold theory were the keywords used . The criteria for study selection included the reporting of the correlations among measures of intelligence and creativ - ity ; t tests , chi - square , and F tests with a single df , as well as exact p values . Much of the research examined in the pre - sent study failed to report detailed information on proce - dures , results , or both , thus making it difficult or impossible to generate correlation coefﬁcients . Some stud - ies did report on IQ scores and creativity scores , but the correlation coefﬁcients that were reported were IQ and cre - ativity scores with various creative achievements . Effect Size Calculations A quantitative synthesis of the remaining 21 studies was conducted , which was assisted by Schwarzer’s Meta 5 . 3 statistical software . Fisher’s z transformation of r was used for analyses in order to adjust for the nonnormal distribu - tion of r . Most researchers believe that studies that employ large samples should get more credit than those that are based on small samples because correlations are known to become more stable as sample size increases ( Schwarzer , 1991 ) . Thus , the effect size z r was weighted by sample size : The weighted mean z r = ∑ ( N j – 3 ) z rj / ∑ ( N j – 3 ) , in this equation z rj is the Fisher z r , corresponding to any r ( Rosenthal , 1991 ) . Each mean r was tested using a random effects model of variance , and the reported values of r are back transformations from z ( Hunter , Schmidt , & Jackson , 1982 ) . A correlation coefficient was judged het - erogeneous when the residual standard deviation exceeded three fourths of the effect size and sampling error was less than 75 % of the observed variance ( Schwarzer ) . The resid - ual standard deviation was used as the standard error in estimating 95 % conﬁdence intervals ( CI ) . Four - hundred forty - seven correlation coefﬁcients were retrieved from 21 studies , for a total sample size of 45 , 880 people . Multiple correlation coefficients were obtained from studies that included more than one correlation using several creativity subscales and reported separate results for gender . When using several correlation coefﬁcients per study in analyses of moderators , a conservative statistical criterion ( p < . 001 ) was used to protect against Type I error ( Rosenthal , 1991 ; Rosenthal & Rubin , 1984 ) . As reported above , individual correlation coefficients were weighted by sample sizes ( Hedges & Olkin , 1985 ; Hunter & Schmidt , 1990 ; Rosenthal ) in order to adjust for sampling errors in r , giving more credence to studies with large samples because small sample sizes can increase Type II error ( Hedges & Olkin ) . Moderator Variables In order to test whether correlation coefficient sizes vary systematically across differing levels of variables that are posited to influence the relationship between intelli - gence and creativity , analyses of moderator variables were conducted . Correlation coefficient size heterogeneity can be explained through moderator variables . The modera - tor variables were categorized in a manner that seemed the - oretically valid . The correlation coefficients between divergent thinking abilities and intelligence vary widely depending upon the divergent thinking tests , the hetero - geneity of the sample , and the testing conditions ( Barron & Harrington , 1981 ) . Therefore , factors that might mod - erate the estimated population correlation coefficients between IQ scores and creativity scores in the present study were considered by comparing correlation coeffi - cients based on various IQ tests , levels of IQ scores , sev - eral creativity tests , creativity test types , creativity subscales , gender , age , and IQ scores below and above 120 . Most studies did not report information about subjects’ ethnic - ity , making it impossible to include ethnicity as a modera - tor variable . When data was entered , the creativity test subscales of associational ﬂuency , ideational ﬂuency , and verbal and figural fluency were classified as “fluency , ” whereas sponta - neous flexibility , adaptive flexibility , and verbal and fig - 58 The Journal of Secondary Gifted Education Kim ural flexibility were classified as “flexibility . ” Both verbal and ﬁgural originality were categorized as “originality . ” In several of the creativity tests in the present study ( e . g . , Flescher , 1963 ; Getzels & Jackson , 1962 ; Hocevar , 1980 ; Kogan & Pankove , 1972 ; Vernon , 1972 ; Wallach & Kogan , 1965 ) , subscales were not reported . Thus , the tasks in these studies were examined and categorized based on the nature of those tasks . For age , 87 kindergarteners ( from Ward , 1968 ) were included in the elementary group , and naval recruits ( from Richards , 1976 ) and college students were included in the adult group . Hedges’ g was derived for each individual correlation coefficient in the moderator analysis using Johnson’s DSTAT 1 . 10 meta - analysis software ( 1993 ) . When sig - nificant moderator effects were found , the proportion of variance in the variables that were accounted for by the moderators was determined . Variables that were signiﬁcant moderators were entered into a weighted linear multiple regression model ( weighted by N – 3 ; Rosenthal , 1991 ) using SPSS to clarify their independent effects for explain - ing variations in z r . Then , threshold ( IQ 120 ) was added to the previous weighted linear multiple regression model to check the R ? change to clarify whether the threshold theory had its independent effect for explaining a variation in z r . Results A stem - and - leaf display of the 447 effects is presented in Figure 1 , indicating a nearly normal distribution of cor - relation coefficients . The mean value of r was . 137 ( 95 % CI = . 128 – . 146 ) , or . 174 ( 95 % CI = . 165 – . 183 ) after weighting by sample size . Thus , the mean correlation coef - ﬁcient was judged to be small and statistically signiﬁcant . However , the correlation coefﬁcients were heterogeneous , Q ( 446 ) = 937 . 058 , p < . 0001 ; residual standard deviation was greater than one fourth of population correlation coef - ficient size ( . 044 ) ; and percent of observed variance accounted for by sampling error was 47 . 64 % , which was less than 75 % . Because the data set was heterogeneous , searching for moderators that may account for the remaining systematic variation in the data was necessary ( see Schwarzer , 1991 ) . Analyses of moderators were performed by breaking down the data into at least three subsets with respect to theo - retically relevant variables . Moderator analyses were con - ducted to determine whether moderators describing subjects or features of IQ and creativity tests might account for variability in the magnitude of correlation coefficients . Each simple contrast tested as z at p < . 001 . Correlation coefficients for each moderator are reported in Tables 1 – 8 as mean r . Variability in the magnitude of correlation coefficients between creativity test scores and IQ scores among different IQ tests ( QB [ 6 ] = 170 . 193 , p < . 0001 ) , different IQ levels ( QB [ 4 ] = 55 . 441 , p < . 0001 ) , threshold ( QB [ 2 ] = 17 . 625 , p < . 001 ) , different creativity tests ( QB [ 3 ] = 203 . 079 , p < . 0001 ) , creativity test types ( QB [ 3 ] = 34 . 718 , p < . 0001 ) , creativity subscales ( QB [ 4 ] = 88 . 380 , p < . 0001 ) , gender ( QB [ 2 ] = 19 . 163 , p < . 0001 ) , and age ( QB [ 4 ] = 223 . 282 , p < . 0001 ) were sig - niﬁcant .

Stem - and - leaf - display for 447 correlation coefficients ( r ) between IQ and creativity scores Note . The correlation coefﬁcients r ranged from - . 46 in the ﬁrst row of the display to + . 76 in the last row . Threshold As Table 1 shows , the mean of the 65 correlation coef - ﬁcients for below IQ 120 was . 201 . The correlation coef - ﬁcients were heterogeneous , Q ( 64 ) = 159 . 170 , p > . 0001 . The mean of the 14 correlation coefficients for above IQ 120 was . 235 . The correlation coefﬁcients were heteroge - neous , Q ( 13 ) = 45 . 654 , p > . 0001 . These heterogeneities observed within the different levels or classes imply that the mean correlation coefﬁcients for each level or class can - not be adequately described with a single correlation coef - ficient . In other words , the variation in the relationships is due to one or more additional factors that the levels or classes do not capture . Post hoc contrasts revealed no statistically significant differences among below and above the threshold and unreported , likely because there were so few correlation coefficients for above IQ 120 . On an a priori basis , IQ below ( r = . 201 ) and above 120 ( r = . 235 ) were not statis - tically different either , χ 2 = 2 . 004 , p = . 157 .

Multiple Regression Analysis Variables that were statistically signiﬁcant moderators ( based on the results of post hoc contrasts ) were entered into a weighted linear multiple regression model to deter - mine their independent effects for explaining variation in the magnitude of correlation coefficients . The results of the direct entry of the four statistically signiﬁcant moder - ating variables of IQ tests , creativity tests , creativity sub - scales , and age into a weighted multiple linear regression analysis indicated that age and creativity subscales inde - pendently accounted for variation in z r . The regression model yielded R ? = . 260 , adjusted R ? = . 235 , F ( 221 ) = 10 . 716 , p < . 0001 .

According to Johnson ( 1993 ) , the tests of meta - ana - lytic predictor’s signiﬁcance are inappropriate because the error degrees of freedom in the weighted regression proce - dure of SPSS are too large . Thus , the appropriate correc - tions in its regression model were made using DSTAT . The results of the weighted multiple linear regression of effect size z r on moderator variables are presented in Table 9 . The various creativity tests ( β = - . 01179 , z = - 2 . 33020 , p < . 001 ) and age ( β = . 03917 , z = 6 . 19332 , p < . 0001 ) had signiﬁcant effects on the magnitude of the correlation coef - ficients between creativity test scores and IQ test scores . Various IQ tests ( β = - . 00170 , z = - . 53790 , p = . 59 . 64 ) and creativity subscales ( β = . 01647 , z = 3 . 72019 , p = . 01980 ) were uncorrelated with the magnitude of the correlation coefficients . The results of the weighted multiple linear regression of effect size z r with the threshold variable are presented in Table 10 . The threshold variable ( β = - . 00726 , z = - . 76628 , p = . 44351 ) was not related to the magnitude of the correlation coefﬁcients . Discussion The quantitative synthesis of the literature results indi - cate that the relationship between IQ scores and creativity scores is small and positive , in which the mean effect r was . 174 ( 95 % CI , . 165 - . 183 ) . The correlation coeffi - cients were heterogeneous , but the threshold of IQ 120 , which was examined as one of the possible moderators , could not explain variance in the studies’ correlation coef - ficients . Further , when the IQ scores were divided into the four levels ( IQ < 100 [ r = . 260 ] ; 100 < IQ > 120 [ r = . 140 ] ; 120 < IQ > 135 [ r = . 259 ] ; IQ > 135 [ r = - . 215 ] ) , there were no statistically signiﬁcant differences among the levels according to the results of the post hoc contrasts , although IQ > 135 had a negative mean correlation coef - ﬁcient , r = - . 215 . Thus , the threshold theory was not sup - ported . The results of the post hoc contrasts revealed that IQ tests , creativity tests , creativity subscales , and age explained the differences in correlation coefﬁcients between IQ and creativity tests scores . However , the variance in the mag - nitude of the correlation coefﬁcients was not signiﬁcantly explained by the various IQ tests , subscales of the creativ - ity tests , creativity test types , and gender , but it was sig - niﬁcantly explained by different creativity tests ( p < . 001 ) and age ( p < . 0001 ) according to the results of the weighted multiple linear regression , which determines moderators’ independent effects for explaining variation . Post hoc contrasts revealed a statistically significant difference between Guilford Tests and Wallach - Kogan divergent thinking measures . According to the results of the weighted multiple linear regression , various creativity tests had significant independent effects on the magni - tude of the correlation coefﬁcients between creativity test Winter / Spring 2005 , Volume XVI , Number 2 / 3 63 IQ and Creativity Table 6 Creativity Subscales as a Moderator Creativity Subscale N Mean r Homogeneity Contrast p - value ( # of r ) for contrast Originality 175 . 131 heterogeneous ac , ad < . 0001 Fluency 184 . 170 heterogeneous bc < . 0001 Figural Redeﬁnition 6 . 362 homogeneous ac , bc < . 0001 Flexibility 25 . 231 heterogeneous ad < . 0001 General Creativity 57 . 206 heterogeneous Note .

The mean weighted correlation coefficients between IQ test scores and Wallach - Kogan divergent thinking measure scores , r = . 116 , was much smaller than the mean weighted correlation coefficients between IQ tests scores and Guilford Test scores , r = . 250 . This might be because Wallach - Kogan divergent thinking measures were administered as a game - like activity , whereas the Guilford Tests were administered as tests . Wallach and Kogan ( 1965 ) concluded that traditional intelligence test scores are independent from creativity test scores when the creativity tests are assessed in a game - like , nonevaluative context . Some other studies also support this conclusion ( e . g . , Cropley & Maslany 1969 ; Iscoe & Pierce - Jones , 1964 ; Kogan & Pankove , 1972 ; Pankove & Kogan , 1968 ; Wallach & Wing , 1969 ; Ward , 1968 ) . Torrance ( 1966 ) also recommended the creation of a game - like , thinking , or problem - solving atmosphere in order to avoid the threatening situation associated with testing . His intent was to set a tone so that the examinees would expect to enjoy the activities . Examinees should be encouraged to “have fun , ” and they should experience a psychological climate that is as comfortable and stimulating as possible ( see Kim , in press ) . Thus , according to the TTCT manual ( Ball & Torrance , 1984 ) , administrators of the tests should invite the examinees to enjoy the activities and view the tests as a series of fun activities , thereby reducing test anxiety . Torrance ( 1987 ) suggested a warm - up activity before administration of the TTCT for arousing the incubation processes and increasing motivation , thereby enabling cre - ative energy . Despite Torrance’s recommendation , how - ever , none of the studies using the TTCT included in the present study reported that the TTCT was administered in a game - like testing context . Thus , how many adminis - trators of the TTCT included in this study invited the examinees to enjoy the activities cannot be known . That might be why the mean correlation coefficient of the TTCT was . 218 , which was not significantly different from either test - like Guilford Tests ( r = . 250 ) or game - like 64 The Journal of Secondary Gifted Education Kim Table 8 Age as a Moderator Age Group N Mean r Homogeneity Contrast p - value ( # of r ) for contrast Elementary 251 . 086 homogeneous ab , ac , ad < . 0001 Middle 27 . 210 heterogeneous ab < . 0001 High 105 . 261 heterogeneous ac < . 0001 Adult 53 . 205 heterogeneous ad < . 0001 Unreported 11 . 267 heterogeneous Note .

Therefore , it can be concluded that , when creativity tests are administered in a game - like testing context , the cre - ativity test scores have smaller relationships with IQ test scores . The variance in the magnitude of the correlation coef - ficients was also significantly explained by the variance among age groups . For older groups ( middle school , high school , and adult groups ) , IQ scores were more closely associated with creativity scores than within the younger group ( kindergarten through fifth - grader group ) . Given that even the same tests may measure different processes when administered to subjects of differing ages ( Ward , 1968 ) , creativity tests may also measure different con - structs among various ages . This is supported by previous studies ( Kim , 2004 ; Kim , Cramond , & Bandalos , 2004 , in press ) that show that the latent structure of the TTCT is more invariant across gender than across grade groups . The relationship between creativity and IQ scores among younger children might be smaller because of less educa - tional inﬂuence over the use of their cognitive abilities , as compared with older people . In conclusion , the negligible relationship between cre - ativity and IQ scores indicates that even students with low IQ scores can be creative . Therefore , teachers should be aware of characteristics of creative students—this will enable teachers to see the potential of each child . In con - trast with the threshold theory , neither IQ 120 nor differ - ent levels of IQ scores explained variation in the correlation coefﬁcients . The differences in the correlation coefficients between IQ scores and creativity test scores were not significantly explained by the various IQ tests , subscales of the creativity tests , or creativity test types , whereas different creativity tests and age were consistent moderator variables . The signiﬁcantly independent mod - erator effect for creativity tests indicates that , when cre - ativity tests are administered in a game - like context , the creativity test scores have smaller relationships with IQ test scores than when creativity tests are administered in a test - like context . The significantly independent moderator effect for age , in which IQ scores were more closely asso - ciated with creativity scores for younger groups than for older groups , indicates less educational influence on stu - dents’ use of their cognitive abilities for younger groups compared with older groups . However , the findings of the present study in terms of the threshold theory are limited in generalizability because , for the 368 of the 447 correlation coefﬁcients , the subjects’ IQ scores were unreported or unable to be used . For future studies , more studies that have reported IQ scores are needed . References Ball , O . E . , & Torrance , E . P . ( 1984 ) . Streamlines scoring workbook : Figural A .
