This can be problematic as the materials may not be relevant or useful to users’ contexts or goals , or , at worst , could lead to alienation and exclusion . We propose an approach that shifts control of design materials to users , supporting them to select and utilize personal objects in the design process . We conducted a case study alongside a STEM education nonprofit based in Chicago to explore how 9 young adults brought in and engaged with personal objects in the co - design of a “Safe Spaces” event for peers . We found that the personal objects helped inform participants’ designs , structure the conversation , and foster inclusion and common ground . We provide suggestions for how to support users bringing in and using personal objects as design materials .

Despite being an integral component of the design process [ 34 ] and human experience [ 7 , 13 , 38 ] , the selection and use of design materials is not only overlooked , but can also adversely affect or exacerbate this exclusivity . For example , design materials ( e . g . , sticky notes [ 23 ] , crayons [ 31 ] , microcontrollers , tablets ) are often ascribed to users despite not being relevant or useful to users’ goals This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution International 4 . 0 License .

These materials are often value - laden and overlook users’ situated contexts [ 4 , 20 ] . Users may also prefer to draw on their own tangible or intangible artifacts , such as oral narratives [ 4 ] , metaphors and symbols [ 1 ] , and skills and wisdom [ 40 ] . What if , instead of facilitators imposing materials on users , we shift control by inviting users to bring in objects from their lives to use as design materials ? What are some mechanisms to support this process , as well as the myriad of possible ( tangible and intangible ) objects users may want to bring in ? In this paper , we present preliminary findings from a case study with a STEM ( science , technology , engineering , math ) education nonprofit in Chicago focused on providing out - of - school oppor - tunities for underrepresented young adults . We collaborated with nonprofit leadership to embed our innovative concept and approach in a co - design workshop focused on creating a “Safe Spaces” kick - back event by and for young adults . We observed how 9 young adults ( ages 16 - 21 ) brought in and engaged with a myriad of per - sonal objects in the design of the kickback event for peers . We found that personal objects and our “4 C’s” approach helped inform participants’ event design , add structure to the workshop , and con - nect participants to one another and foster common ground . We contribute an empirical investigation into how users can leverage personal objects in design , and provide suggestions for activities to scaffold this process . 2 RELATED WORK We situate our work within the broader paradigm of Assets - based design in CSCW and HCI [ 5 , 8 , 40 ] , which draws from the para - digm of Assets - based community development ( ABCD ) [ 30 ] . Assets - based design aims to shift design from a deficit - based view to one leveraging communities’ strengths , capacities , and assets ( e . g . , skills , relationships , and infrastructure ) . Our approach extends this para - digm by focusing in particular on how assets are linked to personal objects . Some common co - design techniques foregrounding materials include Cultural probes [ 19 ] , Bags of stuff [ 12 ] , Toolkits [ 27 , 39 ] , and Contestational artifacts [ 10 , 33 ] . Importantly , facilitators typically decide the materials in these techniques . Our approach differs as it aims to shift control of materials to users , thus enabling users to have more say over design . Other techniques encourage users to bring in “things” from their lives , such as different types of End - user photography [ 35 ] including Photo - elicitation [ 18 , 32 ] , Photovoice [ 23 ] , and Photo collaging [ 28 ] , as well as Journaling [ 15 , 36 ] . To support users to share what they want in the format they want , we extend the range of objects users can bring in and design with . This may include objects that are found , personally meaningful ( e . g . , mementos ) , tangible , intangible , 235 CSCW ’23 Companion , October 14 – 18 , 2023 , Minneapolis , MN , USA Salma Elsayed - Ali et al . analog , or digital . This way , our approach may also be used in more contexts and more frequently . Two previous approaches focus on material - based prototyping using physical , locally - embedded objects [ 22 ] : Small change [ 21 ] focuses on “real” objects as prototypes drawing on and implemented into local practice , such as a bus stop prototype that engenders a marketplace and activates a local community [ 22 ] . A related , broader approach is Frugal innovation , which draws on renewable materials that are “ affordable , sustainable , lightweight , and rugged ” [ 2 ] . Our approach differs in that it is not focused specifically on prototyping , and it promotes contributions at the individual level . Our approach aims to bridge the gap between previous ap - proaches by 1 ) shifting control of design materials to users , 2 ) extending the range of objects users can bring in and design with , 3 ) promoting individuals’ contributions , and 4 ) foregrounding the potential of personal objects as design materials . From an empirical perspective , we also extend past work [ 9 , 11 , 13 , 17 , 26 , 29 , 37 ] by conducting empirical investigations specifically focusing on under - standing the impact of personal objects on the design process and partners’ participation as designers . 3 INTEGRATING PERSONAL OBJECTS INTO CO - DESIGN WITH THE “4 C’S” APPROACH Design Activities : To scaffold co - design and support participants’ bringing in and engaging with their objects , the research team suggested pre - workshop and in - workshop design activities . These activities had been iteratively developed and tested by the research team in pilots . They were created with the intention of integrating into communities’ existing practice , as well as being self - directed ( i . e . , without supervision from the research team ) . We structured design activities to build on one another so that participants’ objects were interwoven throughout the process . We were intentional in our design of the sequence of activities , but also wanted to allow for the flexibility of communities to pick and choose which activities to incorporate , when , how often , and for how long . Depending on the goals of the community , it may be helpful to repeat or omit certain design activities . At a high level , the design activities include ( using the “4 C’s” mnemonic ) : • Choose : Participants select object ( s ) to bring in before ses - sion ( see prompt below ) ; during the session , participants go around and share what they brought in and why . • Connect : Participants draw connections between the objects they shared . • Consider : Participants think of key considerations when creating solutions to their topic . • Create : Participants brainstorm or design solutions to their topic . Prompt : In addition to the suggested design activities , the re - search team iteratively developed a prompt that lends itself to the design topic at hand and supports participants to choose the per - sonal objects to bring in . The prompt enabled participants to think about and engage with the project outside of workshop time [ 11 ] , as well as encouraged forethought , reminded participants to bring in their objects , and was an opportunity to articulate what it was they were bringing in before sharing with the group . The workshop facil - itator , who we refer to as Noora , and the lead author came up with a generative prompt reflecting the theme of “Safe Spaces , ” which was to “bring in something from your life that represents safety or makes you feel safe . ” The young adults texted Noora what they planned to bring in a day before the workshop . We provide a tem - plate for prompts in Appendix A . 1 , which can be altered depending on the goals of the community . 4 CASE STUDY : METHODS Partners : We collaborated with a nonprofit in Chicago focused on providing meaningful learning experiences for local youth un - derrepresented in STEM . A member of our research team , who had established trust through sustained engagement , facilitated our connection to the organization . Through a 1 - year grant from Chicago , our partner organization hired 9 Black young adults ( ages 16 - 21 ) as community ambassadors to organize safe spaces and pro - grams for peers , with an emphasis on STEM . Noora , who is also a member of our partner organization’s leadership , led this effort . Noora and the young adults knew each other , had engaged in simi - lar design activities , and could compare their experiences in this workshop with previous workshops . Table 1 more information on participants . We received informed consent from the young adults or their guardians and all aspects of this study were approved by our university’s review board . Setting : The goal of the co - design workshop was for young adults to plan a “Safe Spaces” kickback event for peers , which entailed brainstorming event themes and activities . We were inter - ested in how the young adults’ personal objects would help them achieve this goal . Noora and the lead author worked closely to embed our approach into existing processes and settings the young adults were familiar with . For example , design activities were struc - tured like a discussion while Noora took notes on a whiteboard , as this was what the young adults were accustomed to . The co - design workshop also took place in a STEM learning center in a community space rented by the organization , in which all young adults had been to on numerous occasions . The co - design workshop lasted 1 . 5 hours . All co - design activities were conducted as a group . Data Collection and Analysis : We triangulated data from a variety of sources to gain a better understanding of how young adults engaged with their materials in the design of a “Safe Spaces” event for peers . We collected observational and artifact data from the co - design workshop . To gather feedback at the end of the work - shop , the young adults participated in a 15 - minute focus group and completed individual surveys on their phones , which included short answer and slider questions . Examples of survey questions include : What made you feel included / not included ? If you have participated in similar sessions before , how would you compare this session to others you have participated in ? We also conducted 1 - hour semi - structured interviews before and after the workshop with Noora . Recordings from the workshop and interviews were transcribed . To make sense of the data , we performed thematic analysis [ 3 ] . The lead researcher open coded the data to identify emerging themes . The research team then discussed and iterated upon emergent themes . 236 Personal Objects as Design Materials : CSCW ’23 Companion , October 14 – 18 , 2023 , Minneapolis , MN , USA 5 CASE STUDY : FINDINGS How did Noora and the young adults instantiate the approach in their co - design workshop ? Choose : Seated around a confer - ence table ( Figure 1 ) , the young adults went around the room shar - ing their names , items they brought in that made them feel safe , and something they learned about another participant . Participants’ ob - jects and their descriptions are noted in Table 1 and listed in Figure 2 . Connect : Noora then asked the young adults , “ So in looking at the board and looking around at the people who have these kind of items , which do you feel connect or kind of like are on the same page , as far as what they do for somebody ? Or any themes that you may notice ? ” Noora drew arrows between the objects that participants made connections between . Participants drew the following connections : ( 1 ) Leire connected the crystal and fringes for spirituality ; ( 2 ) Ana connected the necklace and headphones for overcoming difficulties ; ( 3 ) Aisha connected the dog and Mr . Snuggles for comfort ; ( 4 ) Rosa connected the crystal and necklace for how similar they are ; ( 5 ) Emad connected the headphones and art for expressing emotions ; ( 6 ) Ana connected the crystal and water bottle for radiating energy ; and , ( 7 ) Zuri and Aisha connected the necklace and candle for serv - ing as reminders . While participants drew connections between some objects more than others ( i . e . , Leire’s crystal and Ana’s neck - lace ) , participants found connections between every object at least once . Consider : Next , Noora posed the question , “ Keeping in mind these items and what y’all discussed already today , what are some key things that you think we should consider when designing a ’Safe Space ? ’ ” Noora listed these considerations to the right of the white - board ( Figure 2 ) . Young adults mentioned the following 8 things to consider : ( 1 ) Good energy ; ( 2 ) Boundaries ; ( 3 ) Transparency ; ( 4 ) Open - mindedness ; ( 5 ) Respect of the space ; ( 6 ) One mic , so one per - son talking at a time ; ( 7 ) Correlation and how people connect ; and ( 8 ) Love . It was evident that the previous two activities , Choose and Connect , helped inspire some key considerations like Good energy , Transparency , and Connection . Create : Lastly , the young adults brainstormed themes and activities for the spring kickback event ( Figure 3 ) . Young adults came up with themes including “Spring Fling , ” rebirth , and Hawaiian luau . Noora asked , “ Do you all want to do any activities based off of the items that made y’all feel safe ? ” Leire , Zuri , and Ana suggested doing something relating to art ( in - spired by Eabha’s object ) , such as having an art gallery or painting activity . The young adults agreed music was a given , harkening back to Aisha’s headphones . Ana also suggested including affirma - tions inside Easter eggs , with statements like “You’re so beautiful , ” an idea inspired by their objects that made them feel good . Figure 1 : Young adults seated around table ; Figure 2 : Choose , Connect , and Consider activities ; Figure 3 : Create activity How did the personal objects and our approach impact the design work ? The young adults drew on their personal objects as sources of inspiration in the design of a kickback event for peers . We can trace how participants’ objects , in Noora’s words , “ informed their designs . ” For example , Leire’s crystal and Zuri’s water bottle motivated the young adults to think about the importance of transparency and good energy in their event . Eabha’s art inspired her peers to come up with art - related activities . Likewise , Ana came up with Easter egg hunt affirmations based on a peers’ object that made them feel good . In the Noora’s post - workshop interview , she said “ like with the Easter egg hunt with the affirmations and all that kind of stuff I feel like directly came from what they talked about what made them feel safe versus usually it’s just ’I saw a silent party last week that looked cool , let’s do that . ’ You know , so definitely different . ” Along with drawing inspiration from their personal objects , the young adults felt their objects helped structure the conversation and co - design workshop . Sharing their personal objects was a way to get “everybody to talk , like it got me wanting to talk . . . It didn’t feel like work , you feel me ? You tricked us into working , ” as Leire expressed . Compared to previous workshops , participants thought this workshop was more structured . For example , Baoyi shared “ This one was pretty quick , others usually drag too long , this one 237 CSCW ’23 Companion , October 14 – 18 , 2023 , Minneapolis , MN , USA Salma Elsayed - Ali et al . Table 1 : Participants’ name ( pseudonyms for anonymity ) , age , gender , race , and personal object ( as described by participants ) . Pseudonym Age Gender Race Personal Object Object Description ( In participants’ words ) Leire 21 Female Black Black tourmaline crystal “My crystal makes me feel safe because it radiates this protective energy . I usually just leave it in my car like it’s all the bad juju bounces off of my car . ” Zuri 18 Non - binary Black Water bottle “The thing I brought today , or like my safe item , is a bottle of water . It makes me feel safe because I relate to water so much like our body is made up of 72 % water . My sign is Aquarius , we are bearers of water . I just love water so much and water loves me . ” Aisha 16 Female Black Headphones “My safe thing that I brought was my headphones because I love music . Like the vibrations from music exude me . It’s like when I turn it up on the highest level I can’t hear nothing else around me . ” Eabha 17 Female Black Art [ pictures on phone ] “The thing I brought in was my art , and I say art because it allows me to get away from my thoughts . ” Coral 18 Female Black Dog [ pictures on phone ] “I brought a picture of my dog [ named Cash ] because he is really my baby . He is so sweet , even though he can get his moments when I’m gone . ” Ana 18 Female Black Necklace “The thing that I brought in today is a necklace . It represents cause and effect within my life . It’s like chaos to peace . Before there was chaos and then I feel like I connected with a talk that brought peace in my life [ necklace reminds her of a talk ] . ” Emad 17 Male Black Fringes on clothes “I brought my fringes that I wear every day [ unzips jacket to show shirt underneath ] . These are something I wear every day because I follow the Bible . These are something that God told us to wear to protect us and to keep us with like a righteous mind . ” Baoyi 17 Male Black Candle “I brought a candle from my grandpa who passed away . He used to make me feel safe . ” Rosa 16 Female Black Mr . Snuggles “I brought in Mr . Snuggles [ stuffed animal in the shape of a purple sloth ] . He makes me feel happy and I’ve had him since I was 10 years old . ” was perfect . ” Ana added , “ It was good , it was like very accordant , like everything was in order . ” Noora also thought this workshop was more intentional and thoughtful : “ I will say it was a lot more intentional of a session . because a lot of it [ previous sessions ] is just kind of them thinking in the air . We talk , we brainstorm , and then we vote on the best ideas and like , although that still solicits results , they’re less thoughtful of a result . ” Noora considered what the session would have looked like had the young adults only participated in the first design activity ( Choose ) : “ I think the process was helpful . I think , just bringing in items minus the process probably would not have elicited the same feedback . ” How did the personal objects and our approach impact the young adults as designers ? Overall , the young adults shared that they felt more included in the co - design process . Sharing their personal objects was a way for young adults to open up to their peers . Ana recounted how “ it made me feel good to have a nice , safe place to open up to tell people about my experience , my cause and my effect . ” Similarly , Emad felt “ It was good , got to show who I am to my coworkers . ” Young adults recounted how the experience of bringing in and sharing their personal objects helped them to feel heard and seen . In their post - workshop survey responses , the young adults shared what made them feel included : ( 1 ) Zuri wrote “ people listening to me , I don’t feel like many people do that . ” ( 2 ) Baoyi wrote , “ how everyone spoke to each other and made you feel included . ” ( 3 ) and Emad wrote , “ I had a voice . ” Only one participant , Zuri , shared in the focus group and survey that “ it was scary , I don’t like letting people in my personal life , ” but liked the process of “ getting to know and understand each other better . ” Zuri’s feedback was an important reminder of the need for mechanisms that support different social preferences or personalities in co - design . The personal objects also led to outcomes participants could carry over into other workshops and their personal lives . For example , personal objects were a way of building connections and fostering common ground . In Noora’s words , “ I think finding the connections between the artifacts helped the students to find connections just between each other in general and find common ground . ” The young adults recounted how they enjoyed connecting with their peers and how opening up to one another made connecting easier . Leire stated , “ It made me feel more connected and like , I feel like when people open up you can actually like connect with people . You get to do some introspection with people you’ve been working with . ” Additionally , young adults emerged with a newfound understanding of their objects and what can constitute a design material . For example , Ana shared that “ It made me want to think more about things on a deeper level , like if I got a teddy bear at home I can take this thing home and do it to my teddy bears . ” 238 Personal Objects as Design Materials : CSCW ’23 Companion , October 14 – 18 , 2023 , Minneapolis , MN , USA 6 DISCUSSION Previous work has documented instances where Participatory de - sign has fallen short of its inclusive ideals [ 14 , 24 , 25 ] . One aspect of Participatory design , materials , is critical to the experience and participation of users—as well as design output— yet is often over - looked or imposed on users . In this paper , we proposed an approach that shifts control of design materials to users by inviting them to bring in personal objects from their lives . Extending prior work on Assets - based design [ 5 , 8 , 40 ] , we aimed to leverage tangible or intangible artifacts that participants choose to bring in . To support participants in their selection and use of their objects , we suggested a set of pre - workshop and in - workshop design activities ( the “4 C’s” ) as well as a prompt . We presented observations and direct accounts from young adults and the workshop facilitator into their experiences of engaging in the co - design of a “Safe Spaces” kick - back event for peers . From these observations and accounts , we see how the young adults were able to share aspects of their identities and lived experiences in the design process , perhaps more than in previous workshops . The outcomes of Participatory design engage - ments may not always be tangible solutions , but may be increases in self - efficacy , capacities , and shifts in mindsets . An example of this is how Hussain et al . focused on building local capacity of Cambodian prosthetists and engineers by teaching them design principles so that future design projects could be carried out in - dependent of researchers [ 26 ] . In this case study , we encouraged the young adults to think about their objects in new ways and to recognize the viability of everyday objects , whether tangible or intangible , as design material . An outcome of this was participants , like Ana , wanting to adopt this approach outside of the immediate design context and on their own . In future work , we will explore the scalability of this approach and how other groups embed our approach in their co - design workshops . We are curious how this approach can be adapted across design contexts , modalities ( e . g . , Distributed Participatory design [ 6 , 16 ] ) , and beyond a single work - shop ; what happens when the design activities are implemented differently than suggested ; what happens when participants do not know each other ; and how the personal objects can be used in physical prototyping of co - design solutions .
