During this process , normal epithelial 54 cells can recognize and actively eliminate transformed cells , a process called 55 Epithelial Defence Against Cancer ( EDAC ) . Here , we show that mitochondrial 56 membrane potential is diminished in RasV12 - transformed cells when they are 57 surrounded by normal cells . In addition , glucose - uptake is elevated , leading to 58 higher lactate production . The mitochondrial dysfunction is driven by 59 upregulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 , which positively regulates 60 elimination of RasV12 - transformed cells . Furthermore , EDAC from the 61 surrounding normal cells , involving Filamin , drives the Warburg effect - like 62 metabolic alteration . Moreover , using a cell competition mouse model , we 63 demonstrate that PDK - mediated metabolic changes promote the elimination of 64 RasV12 - transformed cells from intestinal epithelia . These data indicate that non - 65 cell - autonomous metabolic modulation is a crucial regulator for cell competition , 66 shedding light on the unexplored events at the initial stage of carcinogenesis . 67 68 4 INTRODUCTION 69 70 It remains enigmatic what happens at the initial stage of carcinogenesis where 71 oncogenic transformation occurs in a single cell within the epithelium 1 - 3 . Recent 72 studies have demonstrated that newly emerging transformed cells are often eliminated 73 from epithelial tissues via cell competition against the neighbouring normal epithelial 74 cells . Cell competition is a process by which two different cell populations , upon 75 interaction , compete with each other for survival and space ; consequently , the loser 76 cells are eliminated from the tissues , while the winner cells occupy the vacant spaces . 77 This phenomenon was originally found and has been extensively studied in 78 Drosophila 4 - 9 . But , recent studies have revealed that cell competition can also occur in 79 mammals between normal and various types of transformed epithelial cells . For 80 example , RasV12 - , Src - or erbB2 - transformed cells are apically extruded when they 81 are surrounded by normal epithelial cells 10 - 13 . In addition , tumour suppressor protein 82 Scribble - or Mahjong - knockdown cells undergo apoptosis and leave a monolayer of 83 normal epithelial cells 7 , 14 . Importantly , when transformed cells alone are present , 84 neither apical extrusion nor apoptosis occurs , indicating that the presence of the 85 surrounding normal cells profoundly influences the behaviour and fate of transformed 86 cells . 87 We and other groups have explored the molecular mechanisms of cell competition 88 between normal and RasV12 - transformed epithelial cells and revealed that various 89 non - cell - autonomous changes occur in both cells at their interface . For instance , 90 normal epithelial cells accumulate cytoskeletal protein Filamin at the interface with 91 the adjacent transformed cells , thereby actively eliminating them 15 . This implies a 92 notion that normal epithelial cells have anti - tumour activity that does not involve 93 5 immune cells : a process termed EDAC ( Epithelial Defence Against Cancer ) 15 . By 94 contrast , in RasV12 - transformed cells that are surrounded by normal cells , actin - 95 binding protein Epithelial Protein Lost In Neoplasm ( EPLIN ) is accumulated 16 . The 96 accumulated EPLIN then activates the downstream molecules such as PKA and 97 myosin - II , which positively regulate apical extrusion of RasV12 cells . However , the 98 molecular mechanisms of how EDAC from normal cells affects the neighbouring 99 transformed cells and promotes their elimination are still poorly understood . 100 Cellular metabolism is dynamically modulated and adjusted in accordance with 101 various conditions . For example , at the later stage of cancer development , aerobic 102 glycolysis is enhanced in tumour cells , often accompanied by the downregulation of 103 mitochondrial activity ; these metabolic changes are called Warburg effect 17 - 21 . But , it 104 is not clearly understood whether cellular metabolism is also affected at the initial 105 stage of carcinogenesis . In this study , we have examined whether and how the 106 metabolic status is regulated at the interface between normal and newly emerging 107 transformed epithelial cells . 108 109 6 RESULTS 110 Warburg effect - like metabolic changes occur in RasV12 - transformed cells that 111 are surrounded by normal cells 112 To examine the involvement of metabolic regulation in cell competition , we first 113 examined mitochondrial energy metabolism at the interface between normal and 114 RasV12 - transformed epithelial cells . TMRM ( tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester ) is a 115 positively charged red fluorescent dye that accumulates in active mitochondria 116 according to the negative membrane potential gradient across their inner membranes . 117 We found that the TMRM fluorescence , but not the fluorescence of a control dye 118 CMTPX , was strongly reduced in RasV12 - transformed epithelial cells surrounded by 119 normal epithelial cells compared to that in RasV12 - transformed cells cultured alone 120 or in GFP - expressing cells surrounded by normal cells ( Fig . 1a - c , g ) . The comparable 121 phenomenon was also observed in Src - transformed cells , but not in Scribble - 122 knockdown cells ( Supplementary Fig . 1a , b ) . The decreased incorporation of TMRM 123 was observed in both apically extruding and extruded RasV12 cells ( Fig . 1d ) . The mix 124 ratio of normal and RasV12 cells affected the TMRM incorporation in RasV12 cells ; 125 the decreased TMRM incorporation was clearly observed at 50 : 1 or 10 : 1 , but less 126 frequently occurred at 4 : 1 or 1 : 1 . This is compatible with the previous report 127 demonstrating that the proportion of winner - loser cells profoundly influences the 128 occurrence of cell competition 22 . The non - cell - autonomous downregulation of 129 mitochondrial membrane potential was also confirmed by using mitoSOX , an 130 indicator for mitochondrial superoxide production that reflects mitochondrial ATP 131 production ( Fig . 1e - g ) . Immunofluorescence of the mitochondrial resident protein 132 Tom20 or MitoTracker Green fluorescence which is incorporated into mitochondria in 133 a membrane potential - independent manner showed that the number of mitochondria 134 7 was not altered in RasV12 cells surrounded by normal cells ( Fig . 1h and 135 Supplementary Fig . 1c - h ) . In addition , by electron microscopic analyses , 136 mitophagosome - like structures were frequently observed in RasV12 cells that were 137 surrounded by normal epithelial cells ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . Collectively , these data 138 imply that the decreased TMRM incorporation does not result from a change in 139 mitochondrial mass , but from a change in mitochondrial function . Furthermore , we 140 found that incorporation of glucose analogue 2 - NBDG was enhanced in RasV12 cells 141 surrounded by normal cells ( Fig . 2a , b ) , suggesting that uptake of glucose is enhanced 142 in a non - cell - autonomous fashion . Moreover , expression of LDHA , which converts 143 pyruvate to lactate , was significantly increased in RasV12 - transformed cells that were 144 surrounded by normal cells ( Fig . 2c - e and Supplementary Fig . 3a ) . Accordingly , 145 lactate secretion was higher in RasV12 cells than normal cells , and was further 146 enhanced when RasV12 cells were surrounded by normal cells ( Fig . 2f ) . This non - 147 cell - autonomous increase in lactate secretion was abolished when LDHA was 148 knocked down in RasV12 cells ( Fig . 2f and Supplementary Fig . 4e ) . These data 149 indicate that the interaction with the neighbouring normal epithelial cells potentiates 150 the Warburg effect - like metabolic changes in transformed cells : downregulation of 151 mitochondrial function and enhanced aerobic glycolysis . 152 153 PDK4 plays a crucial role in the decreased mitochondrial membrane potential 154 and apical extrusion of RasV12 - transformed cells surrounded by normal cells 155 To reveal the molecular mechanism that causes the Warburg effect - like phenomenon , 156 we examined expression of various metabolic enzymes by quantitative real - time PCR 157 and found that expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 ( PDK4 ) was 158 significantly elevated in RasV12 - transformed cells when they were co - cultured with 159 8 normal cells ( Fig . 3a ) . PDK4 phosphorylates and thus inactivates pyruvate 160 dehydrogenase ( PDH ) that catalyses conversion of pyruvate to acetyl - CoA , thereby 161 blocking the entry into the TCA cycle ( Supplementary Fig . 3a ) . Indeed , 162 phosphorylation of PDH was also enhanced in RasV12 cells when they were 163 surrounded by normal cells ( Fig . 3b - d ) . To examine the functional involvement of 164 PDK4 , we established RasV12 - transformed cells stably expressing PDK4 - shRNA 165 ( Fig . 3e ) and CRISPR - edited PDK4 - knockout RasV12 - transformed cells 166 ( Supplementary Fig . 3b ) . PDK4 - knockdown or PDK4 - knockout suppressed PDH 167 phosphorylation and significantly restored TMRM incorporation in RasV12 cells 168 surrounded by normal cells ( Fig . 3f , g and Supplementary Fig . 3c - g ) , suggesting that 169 upregulation of PDK4 is , at least partly , responsible for the decreased mitochondrial 170 membrane potential . PDK4 - knockdown or - knockout also suppressed LDHA 171 accumulation ( Supplementary Fig . 3h - j ) . Interestingly , PDK4 - knockdown or - 172 knockout drastically suppressed apical extrusion of RasV12 cells , while promoting 173 formation of basal protrusions that extended beneath the neighbouring normal cells 174 ( Fig . 3h , i and Supplementary Fig . 3k - n ) . DCA is a specific inhibitor of the PDK 175 family 23 , 24 of which upregulation is often observed in the later stage of cancer 25 - 28 . 176 Therefore , DCA has been intensively tested in clinical trials for treatment of 177 malignant cancer including glioblastoma and various solid tumours 29 - 32 . We found 178 that treatment of DCA caused the comparable effect to that induced by PDK4 179 knockdown / knockout : suppression of PDH phosphorylation ( Fig . 4a ) , restoration of 180 TMRM incorporation ( Fig . 4b , c ) and suppression of apical extrusion and promotion 181 of basal protrusions ( Fig . 4d , e ) . We also demonstrated that another PDK inhibitor 182 Radicicol phenocopied the effect of DCA ( Supplementary Fig . 4a - d ) . DCA treatment 183 also suppressed elevated LDHA expression in RasV12 cells surrounded by normal 184 9 cells ( Fig . 4a ) . In contrast , knockdown of LDHA in RasV12 cells did not affect 185 TMRM incorporation ( Supplementary Fig . 4e , f ) , suggesting that decreased 186 mitochondrial membrane potential causes LDHA upregulation . Moreover , 187 knockdown of LDHA moderately suppressed apical extrusion ( Supplementary Fig . 188 4g ) . These results imply that the PDK4 - mediated Warburg effect - like metabolic 189 alteration influences the behaviour of transformed cells and promotes their 190 elimination from epithelia . When PDH - knockdown cells were surrounded by normal 191 cells , apical extrusion did not occur ( Supplementary Fig . 4h - j ) , indicating that 192 downregulation of mitochondrial membrane potential alone is not sufficient to cause 193 apical extrusion . Thus , while the non - cell - autonomously induced metabolic changes 194 play an indispensable role in the elimination of transformed cells , additional , 195 unidentified molecular mechanisms are also involved in this process , which need to 196 be explored in future studies . 197 198 EDAC and EPLIN act upstream of the Warburg effect - like metabolic changes in 199 RasV12 cells surrounded by normal cells 200 We further examined the molecular mechanism underlying the Warburg effect - like 201 phenomenon . In a previous study , we demonstrated that EPLIN accumulates in 202 RasV12 - transformed cells surrounded by normal cells and plays a positive role in the 203 apical extrusion via activation of the downstream molecules , protein kinase A ( PKA ) 204 and myosin - II 16 . We found that knockdown of EPLIN in RasV12 cells significantly 205 restored mitochondrial membrane potential ( Fig . 5a , b and Supplementary Fig . 5a ) . In 206 addition , EPLIN - knockdown suppressed PDK4 upregulation , phosphorylation of 207 PDH and LDHA accumulation ( Fig . 5c , d and Supplementary Fig . 5b ) . These data 208 indicate that EPLIN is a crucial upstream regulator of the Warburg effect - like 209 10 metabolic changes . Furthermore , we examined the effect of various inhibitors on 210 TMRM incorporation and apical extrusion . Concerning downstream molecules of 211 EPLIN , PKA inhibitor KT5720 reverted TMRM incorporation , whereas myosin - II 212 inhibitor Blebbistatin did not ( Supplementary Fig . 5c and Supplementary Fig . 8a ) . 213 The other tested inhibitors ( Cytochalasin D , NAC , 3 - MA , Y27632 , L - NAME ) did not 214 affect TMRM incorporation ( Supplementary Fig . 5c and Supplementary Fig . 8a ) , 215 indicating the specific effect of KT5720 on TMRM incorporation . Furthermore , 216 KT5720 did not significantly affect expression of PDK4 . These data suggest that 217 EPLIN regulates those metabolic changes via PDK4 - and PKA - dependent pathways 218 ( Supplementary Fig . 8c ) . 219 It was previously reported that normal epithelial cells can recognize and actively 220 eliminate the neighbouring transformed cells , in which Filamin in the normal cells 221 plays an important role , at least partly , by inducing the accumulation of EPLIN in 222 transformed cells 15 , 16 ; this tumour - suppressing process is called EDAC 15 . When 223 RasV12 cells were surrounded by EDAC - deficient Filamin - knockdown cells , TMRM 224 incorporation in RasV12 cells was restored , instead rather promoted in comparison to 225 that in the surrounding knockdown cells ( Fig . 5e , f and Supplementary Fig . 3f and 226 5a ) . In addition , knockdown of Filamin in the surrounding normal cells substantially 227 suppressed phosphorylation of PDH and accumulation of LDHA ( Fig . 5g and 228 Supplementary Fig . 3d , i and 5b ) . Collectively , these data demonstrate that EDAC 229 from normal cells induces the metabolic alterations of the neighbouring transformed 230 cells via EPLIN , thereby promoting elimination of the transformed cells from 231 epithelia ( Supplementary Fig . 8c ) . 232 233 11 Upregulation of the glycolytic pathway plays a positive role in the elimination of 234 RasV12 - transformed cells 235 What is the functional significance of EDAC - induced Warburg effect - like metabolic 236 changes in the apical elimination of transformed cells ? The metabolic shift from 237 mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis can affect various cellular 238 processes such as glucose metabolism , ATP production and resistance to ROS - 239 mediated oxidative stress . Using a glucose - FRET probe , we found that intracellular 240 glucose concentration was substantially diminished in RasV12 cells surrounded by 241 normal cells ( Fig . 6a - c ) , indicating that intracellular glucose is exhausted via 242 massively elevated glycolysis despite of the increased glucose uptake ( Fig . 2a , b ) . The 243 comparable glucose metabolic condition is also reported in conventional Warburg 244 effect 33 - 35 . In addition , the result with the FRET - based ATP sensor ( ATeam ) showed 245 that the ATP level was moderately increased in RasV12 - transformed cells that were 246 surrounded by normal cells ( Supplementary Fig . 5d - f ) , suggesting that the ATP 247 production is fully compensated and even promoted by the enhanced glycolytic 248 pathway . To further understand the functional significance of this process , we 249 examined the effect of a hexokinase inhibitor 2 - deoxy - D - glucose ( 2 - DG ) . Addition of 250 2 - DG diminished the non - cell - autonomously upregulated ATP level ( Supplementary 251 Fig . 5e - g ) and significantly suppressed apical extrusion of RasV12 cells surrounded 252 by normal cells ( Supplementary Fig . 5h , i ) , indicating that the upregulation of the 253 glycolytic pathway plays a positive role in the elimination of transformed cells . The 254 ATP production speed via glycolysis is far greater than that via mitochondria 36 , hence 255 the metabolic shift to glycolysis may be of benefit to transformed cells by supporting 256 prompt energy supply required for the dynamic process of apical extrusion . Note that 257 2 - DG could inhibit both oxidative and fermentative glucose metabolism . To further 258 12 clarify the metabolic alterations during apical extrusion , additional experiments are 259 required in future studies . 260 261 PDK - mediated mitochondrial dysfunction induces apical elimination of RasV12 - 262 transformed cells ex vivo and in vivo 263 To understand the generality and functional significance of these findings , we 264 established an LSL - RasV12 - IRES - eGFP mouse whereby RasV12 expression is 265 induced in a Cre - dependent fashion and traced by simultaneous expression of eGFP 266 ( Supplementary Fig . 6a , b ) . By crossing a Villin - Cre - ERT2 mouse with an LSL - 267 RasV12 - IRES - eGFP mouse , we obtained a cell competition mouse model ( Fig . 7a ) . 268 Administration of a low dose of tamoxifen induces recombination events less 269 frequently , resulting in expression of RasV12 in a mosaic manner within intestinal 270 epithelia ( Supplementary Fig . 6c ) . Using this system , we examined the fate of newly 271 emerging RasV12 - transformed cells that are surrounded by normal epithelial cells ex 272 vivo and in vivo . First , intestinal epithelial cells were collected from these mice and 273 were subjected to crypt organoid culture in the matrigel , followed by tamoxifen 274 treatment 37 . At 12 - 24 h after treatment with a low dose of tamoxifen , RasV12 - 275 expressing cells were apically shifted with wedge - like morphology ; at 36 - 48 h , 276 RasV12 cells were detached from the basement membrane and eventually extruded 277 into the apical lumen ( Fig . 7b , top ) . In contrast , cells expressing only GFP remained 278 within the epithelium , and apical extrusion did not frequently occur ( Fig . 7b , bottom ) . 279 When RasV12 were predominantly expressed in the whole epithelium by a high dose 280 of tamoxifen , the frequency of apical extrusion was strongly suppressed ( Fig . 7c ) , 281 indicating that the presence of the surrounding normal cells induced the elimination of 282 transformed cells in the ex vivo system as well . We also found that EPLIN was 283 13 accumulated in RasV12 cells surrounded by normal cells in a non - cell - autonomous 284 fashion ( Supplementary Fig . 7a ) . Time - lapse analyses of the crypt organoid culture 285 revealed that the event of apical extrusion took rather variable times between 2 - 20 h 286 and that the extruded transformed cells disappeared into the apical lumen 287 ( Supplementary Fig . 7b and Supplementary Videos 1 - 3 ) . Thus , we have successfully 288 established a mouse model system , in which apical elimination of RasV12 - 289 transformed cells can be captured three - dimensionally . Using this experimental 290 system , we found that TMRM incorporation was diminished in both extruding and 291 extruded RasV12 - expressing cells that were surrounded by normal cells ( Fig . 7d , first 292 and second upper panels , e ) , but not in RasV12 - expressing cells surrounded by 293 themselves or in GFP - expressing cells ( Fig . 7d , third and fourth panels , e ) . In 294 addition , phosphorylation of PDH was elevated in RasV12 cells surrounded by 295 normal cells ( Fig . 7f ) . Furthermore , DCA treatment restored the TMRM incorporation 296 and suppressed the apical extrusion of RasV12 cells ( Fig . 7g , h and Supplementary 297 Fig . 7c , d ) . Finally , we examined the fate of RasV12 - transformed cells in vivo . 298 Intraperitoneal injection of a low dose of tamoxifen induced RasV12 expression in a 299 mosaic manner within the intestinal epithelium , and most of RasV12 - expressing cells 300 were apically eliminated after three days of tamoxifen treatment , whereas GFP - 301 expressing cells remained in the epithelial layer ( Fig . 8a - c ) . Using two - photon 302 microscopic in vivo time - lapse imaging , the dynamic mode of apical extrusion of 303 RasV12 - expressing cells was captured ( Fig . 8d and Supplementary Video 4 ) . Finally , 304 we examined the functional role of PDK in the elimination of RasV12 cells from 305 epithelia in vivo . When DCA was administered , apical extrusion of RasV12 cells was 306 significantly suppressed ( Fig . 8e , f ) . Furthermore , we used the recently established 307 iGT ( intestine - specific gene transfer ) system where mouse intestinal epithelia can be 308 14 transfected with siRNA using HVJ - E ( haemagglutinating virus of Japan envelope ) 309 ( Fig . 8g , h ) 38 . We then demonstrated that knockdown of PDK4 significantly 310 suppressed apical extrusion ( Fig . 8i - k ) . Collectively , these data suggest that apical 311 elimination of RasV12 - transformed cells occurs ex vivo and in vivo , which is 312 promoted by the PDK4 - mediated mitochondrial downregulation . 313 314 15 Discussion 315 The glycolytic pathway and mitochondrial function are frequently de - regulated in 316 neoplastic cells in various ways . These metabolic alterations are generally thought to 317 promote cancer progression , though its biological and pathological significance still 318 remains elusive 17 - 20 . Indeed , clinical trials targeting derailed mitochondrial 319 metabolism , such as with DCA , are currently undergoing 29 - 32 . By contrast , our study 320 suggests that the Warburg effect - like metabolic changes can occur at the early stage 321 of carcinogenesis in a non - cell - autonomous fashion and that DCA treatment could 322 potentially suppress eradication of newly emerging transformed cells . Thus , the 323 adverse effect of DCA may need to be carefully re - examined for the longer time 324 periods . 325 The EDAC - mediated Warburg effect - like metabolic shift does not accommodate 326 several features of the prevailing Warburg effect ( Supplementary Fig . 8b ) . 327 Conventional Warburg effect , which is often observed at the relatively late phase of 328 cancer progression , is caused by various genetic and epigenetic insults and adaptation 329 to harsh tumour microenvironments . In contrast , EDAC - induced Warburg effect - like 330 metabolic changes are triggered by the inputs from neighbouring normal cells at the 331 initial stage of carcinogenesis . The conventional Warburg effect is generally 332 associated with upregulation of HIF1 , PDK1 / 3 and PKM2 39 - 46 , whereas in EDAC - 333 induced Warburg effect - like metabolic changes the expression of these enzymes is not 334 elevated , instead EPLIN and PDK4 act as key upstream regulators . Moreover , the 335 most crucial difference between conventional Warburg effect and EDAC - induced 336 metabolic changes is their roles in tumourigenesis ; the former generally plays a 337 tumour - promoting role , whereas the latter potentially plays a tumour - suppressive role 338 by actively eliminating transformed cells . Thus , though these two processes share 339 16 similar metabolic alterations ( mitochondrial downregulation and increased aerobic 340 glycolysis ) , they are governed by distinct upstream and downstream mediators . 341 HIF1 is a crucial regulator for Warburg effect by modulating multiple metabolic 342 pathways including the TCA cycle and glycolytic pathway 47 . Therefore , we explored 343 the involvement of HIF1 in EDAC - induced Warburg effect - like metabolic changes . 344 By using the 5xHRE ( HIF1 responsive element ) reporter assay , we found that HIF1 345 activity was not enhanced in RasV12 cells surrounded by normal cells , compared with 346 that in RasV12 cells cultured alone ( Supplementary Fig . 7e ) . It has been reported that 347 HIF1 enhances transcription of PDK1 / 3 and LDHA , thereby inducing Warburg 348 effect 47 . But , qRT - PCR analysis demonstrated that the mRNA level of PDK1 / 3 or 349 LDHA was not increased in RasV12 cells surrounded by normal cells ( Fig . 3a ) . Thus , 350 we could not obtain evidence showing the involvement of HIF1 in EDAC - induced 351 metabolic changes , and our data suggest that LDHA is post - transcriptionally 352 upregulated by a HIF1 - independent , unknown mechanism . 353 In this study , we have mainly used fluorescence imaging to demonstrate the non - 354 cell - autonomous changes between normal and transformed epithelial cells . In the 355 research field of cell competition , the researchers have struggled with the technical 356 problem : biochemical analyses of each cell population in co - cultures . The non - cell - 357 autonomous changes induced by the neighbouring normal cells are regulated 358 temporally and dynamically , thus once the interaction with normal cells is disrupted , 359 the non - cell - autonomous biochemical changes ( not the mRNA level ) will instantly 360 vanish . To perform biochemical analyses for each cell population , the co - cultured 361 epithelial cells should be first treated with trypsin to disrupt cell - cell adhesions and 362 dissociate cells from each other , which will be then FACS sorted for a few hours . 363 Despite of the substantial number of trials , we have found just minor remaining non - 364 17 cell - autonomous traces after those procedures . To further intensify the findings in this 365 study , we need to exploit new methods such as FRET probes for metabolites in future 366 studies . 367 A previous study in Drosophila has shown that mitochondrial metabolism can be 368 regulated during cell competition 48 . Our data in this study demonstrate that metabolic 369 modulation is a crucial regulator for cell competition between normal and transformed 370 epithelial cells in mammals as well . Further elucidation of the molecular mechanisms 371 that drive the EDAC - induced metabolic changes will lead to novel approaches for 372 cancer prevention . 373 374 375 18 References 376 1 .

Parental MDCK cell is the gift from Walter 23 Birchmeier . The cell line was not found in the database of commonly misidentified cell 24 lines that is maintained by ICLAC and NCBI Biosample . Mycoplasma contamination is 25 regularly tested for all cell lines in use using a commercially available kit ( MycoAlert , 26 Lonza ) . The cell lines were not further authenticated . MDCK , MDCK - pTR 27 GFP - RasV12 , MDCK - pTR cSrcY527F - GFP , MDCK - pTR Scribble - shRNA , 28 MDCK - pTR GFP - RasV12 EPLIN - shRNA and MDCK - pTR Filamin A - shRNA cells 29 were cultured as previously described 10 , 14 - 16 . To establish MDCK - pTRE3G 30 myc - RasV12 cells , cDNA of myc - H - RasV12 was cloned into BamH I / EcoR I sites of 31 pPB - TRE3G - MCS - CEH - rtTA3 - IP , which was constructed by introducing the TRE3G 32 3 promoter with cloning sites , insulator and rtTA3 - expressing elements into a 33 PiggyBac - based vector ( SBI ) . MDCK cells were then transfected with pPB - TRE3G 34 myc - RasV12 by nucleofection ( nucleofector 2b Kit L , Lonza ) , followed by selection in 35 medium containing 5 μ g ml - 1 blasticidin ( Invitrogen ) . MDCK - pTRE3G myc - RasV12 36 cells stably expressing FLII 12 Pglu - 700 μδ 6 49 were established by co - transfecting MDCK 37 cells with pPB - TRE3G myc - RasV12 and pPB - FLII 12 Pglu - 700 μδ 6 , followed by the 38 same selection method as above . To establish MDCK - pTR GFP - RasV12 cells stably 39 expressing PDK4 - shRNA , LDHA - shRNA or Luciferase - shRNA , or MDCK cells stably 40 expressing PDH - shRNA or Luciferase - shRNA in a tetracycline - inducible manner , each 41 shRNA sequences were cloned into the BglII and XhoI site of pSUPER . neo + gfp ( for the 42 former three shRNAs ) or pSUPERIOR . neo + gfp ( for the latter two 43 shRNAs ) ( Oligoengine ) . Sequences of shRNAs are listed in Supplementary Table 1 . For 44 tetracycline - inducible MDCK cell lines , 2 μ g ml - 1 of tetracycline ( Sigma - Aldrich ) was 45 used to induce expression of proteins or shRNAs except for MDCK - pTRE3G 46 myc - RasV12 cells for which 1 μ g ml - 1 of doxycycline ( Sigma - Aldrich ) was used . 47 MDCK - pTR Filamin A - shRNA cells were incubated with tetracycline for 48 h to 48 4 induce sufficient knockdown prior to co - incubation with MDCK - pTR GFP - RasV12 49 cells . For immunofluorescence , cells were plated onto collagen gel - coated coverslips . 50 Type - I collagen ( Cellmatrix Type I - A ) was obtained from Nitta Gelatin and was 51 neutralized on ice to a final concentration of 2 mg ml – 1 according to the manufacturer’s 52 instructions . The CellTracker dyes , CMTPX ( red dye ) , CMFDA ( green dye ) and 53 CMAC ( blue dye ) ( Life Technologies ) were used according to the manufacturer’s 54 instructions . 55 56 CRISPR / Cas9 - based generation of PDK4 knockout cells 57 Guide sequences of PDK4 sgRNA1 and 2 targeting canis PDK4 were designed on the 58 exon 1 and 9 , respectively , as described previously 50 . PDK4 sgRNA sequences ( PDK4 59 sgRNA1 , 5’ - GCTTCGTGATGCGCAGCGC - 3’ ; PDK4 sgRNA2 , 60 5’ - ACGGCACCAACGCCTGTGA - 3’ ) were introduced into the 61 pCDH - EF1 - Hygro - sgRNA vector 51 using primers listed in Supplementary Table 1 . 62 First , MDCK cells were infected with lentivirus carrying pCW - Cas9 as described 51 , and 63 were cultured in the 500 ng ml - 1 puromycin - containing medium . The 64 5 tetracycline - inducible MDCK - Cas9 cells were transfected with the pCDH - EF1 - PDK4 65 sgRNA1 and 2 by nucleofection , followed by selection in medium containing 200 μ g 66 ml - 1 of Hygromycin and subjected to limiting dilution . Indels on the PDK4 exons in 67 each monoclone were analysed by direct sequencing using primers listed in 68 Supplementary Table 1 . To generate PDK4 - deleted cells carrying doxycycline - inducible 69 GFP - RasV12 , pPB - TRE3G GFP - RasV12 was introduced into the PDK4 - deleted cells 70 by nucleofection and antibiotics selection . In addition to the PDK4 - / - MDCK - pTRE3G 71 GFP - RasV12 cells , we generated PDK4 + / + MDCK - pTRE3G GFP - RasV12 cells as a 72 control cell line . 73 74 Mice 75 All animal experiments were conducted under the guidelines by the Animal Care 76 Committee of Hokkaido University . The animal protocols were reviewed and approved 77 by the Hokkaido University Animal Care Committee ( Approval number : 12 - 0116 ) . We 78 used 6 - 10 weeks old C57BL / 6 mice of either sex . To establish 79 DNMT1 - CAG - loxP - STOP - loxP - HRas V12 - IRES - eGFP knock - in mice , the genomic 80 6 fragments of DNA methyltransferase 1 ( DNMT1 ) locus , the loxP - flanked stop and 81 neomycin resistance cassette , cDNA encoding HRas V12 plus frt - flanked IRES - eGFP and 82 diphtheria toxin subunit A gene were inserted into the targeting vector . The resulting 83 plasmid DNA was linearized and electrophoretically transfected into IB10 ES cells . 84 Recombinant alleles were verified by Southern blot analysis . The independent clones 85 were each injected into blastcysts of C57BL / 6 mice and were successfully transmitted 86 through the germ - line , and DNMT1 - CAG - loxP - STOP - loxP - HRas V12 - IRES - eGFP mice 87 ( acc . no . CDB0706K : http : / / www2 . clst . riken . jp / arg / mutant % 20mice % 20list . html ) were 88 thus established . Villin - Cre ERT2 mice 52 were crossed with 89 DNMT1 - CAG - loxP - STOP - loxP - HRas V12 - IRES - eGFP mice or 90 CAG - loxP - STOP - loxP - eGFP mice 53 to create Villin - RasV12 - GFP or Villin - GFP mice 91 respectively . Mice heterozygous for each transgene were used for experiments . For PCR 92 genotyping of mice , primers listed in Supplementary Table 1 were used . The expected 93 sizes of PCR products were 220 bp , 403 bp and 390 bp for Villin - Cre ERT2 , 94 DNMT1 - CAG - loxP - STOP - loxP - HRas V12 - IRES - eGFP and 95 CAG - loxP - STOP - loxP - eGFP mice , respectively . For culturing intestinal organoids , 96 7 isolated crypts from the mouse small intestine were entrapped in Matrigel ( Corning ) and 97 plated in a non - coated 35 - mm glass bottom dish as previously described 36 . The crypts 98 embedded in Matrigel were covered with Advanced DMEM / F12 supplemented with N2 99 ( Invitrogen ) , B27 ( Invitrogen ) , 50 ng ml – 1 EGF ( Peprotech ) , 100 ng ml – 1 Noggin 100 ( Peprotech ) , 1 . 25 mM N - Acetylcystein ( Sigma - Aldrich ) and R - spondin conditioned 101 medium collected from 293T - HA - Rspol - Fc cells kindly provided by Dr . Calvin Kuo 102 ( Stanford University ) . After 96 h culture , organoids were incubated with tamoxifen 103 ( Sigma ) for 24 h to induce transgenes . Subsequently , tamoxifen was washed out , and 104 organoids were cultured for the indicated times for analyses . For in vivo experiments , 105 6 - 10 weeks old Villin - RasV12 - GFP or Villin - GFP mice were given a single 106 intraperitoneal injection of 2 mg of tamoxifen in corn oil ( Sigma ) , and were then 107 sacrificed at 2 , 3 , 5 or 7 days after Cre activation . To examine the effect of DCA , the 108 mice were first pretreated with 5 . 0 g l – 1 DCA in the drinking water for 2 weeks . 109 Subsequently , the mice were injected intraperitoneally with 2 . 0 mg of tamoxifen and 110 sacrificed 3 days later while DCA was continuously administrated during this period . 111 The iGT ( intestine - specific gene transfer ) experiments were performed as previously 112 8 described 37 . Briefly , 3 - 5 cm regions of small intestine drawn out from the peritoneal 113 cavity were tied with nylon string . 300 μ l of the mucus removing solution ( 20 mM 114 DTT , 0 . 05 % Tween - 20 in PBS ) was injected into the intestinal lumen for 15 min , 115 removed and incubated with the same solution for 10 min . After washing with PBS 116 three times by pipetting , 300 μ l of the transfection solution containing Cy3 - labelled 117 siRNA and HVJ - E ( haemagglutinating virus of Japan envelope ) was injected , and the 118 mice were left for 1 h . The sequences of Scramble - and PDK4 - siRNA are listed in 119 Supplementary Table 1 . 2 . 0 mg of tamoxifen was injected into the peritoneal cavity 120 when the wound was sutured . The mice were sacrificed for the analysis after 3 days of 121 iGT . 122 123 Immunofluorescence and western blotting 124 For immunofluorescence , MDCK - pTR GFP - RasV12 , MDCK - pTR cSrcY527F - GFP , 125 MDCK - pTR Scribble - shRNA , MDCK - pTRE3G myc - RasV12 , MDCK - pTR 126 GFP - RasV12 PDK4 - shRNA , MDCK - pTRE3G GFP - RasV12 PDK4 - sgRNA , 127 MDCK - pTR PDH - shRNA , MDCK - pTR GFP - RasV12 EPLIN - shRNA , MDCK - pTR 128 9 GFP - RasV12 LDHA - shRNA or MDCK - pTR GFP - RasV12 Luciferase - shRNA cells 129 were mixed with MDCK , MDCK - pTR Filamin A - shRNA or MDCK - pTR 130 Luciferase - shRNA cells at a ratio of 1 : 50 and plated onto collagen - coated coverslips as 131 previously described 10 . The mixture of cells was incubated for 8 - 12 h , followed by 132 tetracycline or doxycycline treatment for 16 h , except for analyses of apical extrusions 133 that were examined after 24 h of tetracycline or doxycycline addition . Cells were fixed 134 with 4 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) in PBS and permeabilised as previously described 11 . 135 All primary antibodies were used at 1 : 100 , and all secondary antibodies were used at 136 1 : 200 . To monitor the mitochondrial activity or superoxide production , cells were 137 loaded with 50 nM TMRM or 5 μ M MitoSOX respectively for 30 min and subjected to 138 microscopic observation or quantitatively analysed by CellInsight TM image cytometer 139 ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . As to TMRM , we have thoroughly checked and optimized 140 the experimental conditions . After titration of TMRM concentration , we chose 50 nM 141 that provides clear and sufficient fluorescence intensity . By checking the effect of 142 oligomycin and FCCP , we confirmed that the experimental condition is under the 143 non - quenching mode using 50 nM TMRM 54 . We also confirmed that 2 μ g ml - 1 144 10 tetracycline did not affect TMRM fluorescence . The ratiometric images of TMRM and 145 MitoTracker Green were obtained by incubating cells with 200 nM MitoTracker Green 146 for 2 h , briefly washed , and then loaded with 50 nM TMRM . The 2 - NBDG uptake was 147 examined by incubating cells with glucose - free DMEM for 2 h followed by addition of 148 100 μ M 2 - NBDG for 30 min . For immunofluorescence using intestinal organoids , cells 149 grown in matrigels were incubated with Cell Recovery Solution ( Corning ) for 8 min 150 before fixation with 4 % PFA . After fixation , cells were permeabilised in 0 . 5 % Triton 151 X - 100 / PBS for 1 h and blocked in 1 % BSA / PBS for 1 h . For immunohistochemical 152 examinations of the small intestine , the tissues were isolated and fixed in 4 % PFA , 153 dehydrated , and embedded in paraffin . Microsections of each specimen were placed on 154 glass slides , de - paraffinized and processed for immunostaining . The iGT - operated small 155 intestine was embedded in OCT compound ( Tissue - Tek ) , and frozen sections ( 10 μ m ) 156 were cut on a cryostat . Immunofluorescence images were analysed by the Olympus 157 FV1000 or FV1200 system and Olympus FV10 - ASW software . Images were quantified 158 by the MetaMorph software ( Molecular Devices ) . Western blotting was performed as 159 11 previously described 55 . Primary antibodies were used at 1 : 1 , 000 . The western blotting 160 data were analysed using ImageQuant TM LAS4010 ( GE Healthcare ) . 161 162 FRET analysis 163 Glucose - FRET experiments were performed as previously described 56 . In brief , 164 MDCK - pTRE3G myc - RasV12 cells stably expressing FLII 12 Pglu - 700 μδ 6 were 165 co - cultured with MDCK cells at a ratio of 1 : 50 or cultured alone on a collagen gel in 166 35 - mm - diameter , glass - bottom dishes ( Matsunami Glass ) . At 16 h after doxycycline 167 addition , a differential interference contrast ( DIC ) image and CFP and FRET 168 fluorescence images were recorded . FRET efficiency was calculated as a quotient of 169 background - subtracted FRET and CFP images and is presented in an intensity - modified 170 display mode with the MetaMorph software . In the intensity - modified display mode , 171 eight colors from red to blue are used to represent the FRET efficiency . To evaluate 172 ATP level , MDCK - pTRE3G myc - RasV12 cells were transiently transfected with 173 ATeam probe 57 , stained with CMTPX , and were co - cultured with MDCK cells at ratio 174 12 of 1 : 50 or cultured alone on a collagen gel in 35 - mm - diameter , glass - bottom dishes . At 175 16 h after doxycycline addition , FRET efficiency was examined as described above . 176 177 Time - lapse microscopic observation 178 For ex vivo time - lapse analyses , intestinal organoids grown in matrigels were incubated 179 with 100 nM tamoxifen for 24 h to induce transgenes . Subsequently , time - lapse 180 observation was carried out for 24 h in the medium containing no tamoxifen by the 181 Nipkow spinning disk confocal microscopy ( X - Light ; Crest Optics ) . Fluorescence 182 images ( 853 x 720 pixels , 0 . 975 - μ m resolution ) were captured at an exposure of 0 . 25 s . 183 Images of 42 - μ m depth in the z - axis were obtained at 3 - μ m z - steps . 184 For intravital imaging of small intestine in living mice , mice were anesthetized with 185 isoflurane , the small intestine was surgically exposed , and then villi were observed by 186 using two - photon excitation microscopy . Intestinal lumen was visualized with 70 - kDa 187 tetramethylrhodamine - conjugated dextran ( Sigma ) . Nuclei of cells were stained with 188 intravenous injection of Hoechst33342 ( Life Technologies ) just before imaging . The 189 imaging system was composed of a two - photon microscope ( A1 - MP ; Nikon ) driven by 190 13 a laser ( Chameleon Vision II Ti : Sapphire ; Coherent ) tuned to 880 nm and an inverted 191 microscope equipped with a 20× objective lens ( Plan Fluor ; N . A . , 0 . 75 ; Nikon ) . 192 Fluorescent signals were detected through band - pass emission filters at 525 / 50 nm ( for 193 GFP ) and at 575 / 25 nm ( for tetramethylrhodamine ) . Raw imaging data were processed 194 using the Imaris software ( Bitplane ) . 195 196 Electron microscopy 197 MDCK - pTR GFP - RasV12 cells were cultured alone or co - cultured with MDCK cells in 198 collagen gel - coated , grid - imprinted plastic dishes ( μ - Dish 35 - mm Grid - 500 , Ibidi 199 Corporation ) . After tetracycline treatment for 24 h , cells were fixed in 2 % 200 glutaraldehyde in HEPES buffer ( 30 mM HEPES , 0 . 1 M NaCl and 2 mM CaCl 2 ( pH 201 7 . 4 ) ) , and fluorescence and DIC images of GFP - RasV12 cells and the surrounding cells 202 were captured together with the underlying , numbered grid information . Cells were then 203 post - fixed in 2 % osmium tetroxide in 0 . 1 M imidazole ( pH 7 . 4 ) and stained with 1 % 204 uranyl acetate ( UA ) before being dehydrated and embedded in Araldite - Epon resin 205 ( Electron Microscopy Sciences ) . During these procedures , GFP fluorescence was lost , 206 14 but the grid was imprinted onto the resin . Subsequently , GFP - RasV12 cells and the 2 or 207 3 rows of surrounding MDCK cells were selected and excised , while referring to the 208 grid information , morphology of the cells and the captured images . Ultrathin sections of 209 the trimmed sample were poststained with UA and lead citrate , and cells were imaged 210 with an electron microscope ( JEM - 1400 ; JEOL Corporation ) operating at 80 kV . 211 212 Quantitative real - time PCR 213 MDCK - pTR GFP - RasV12 cells or 10 : 1 mix culture of MDCK and MDCK - pTR 214 GFP - RasV12 cells were cultured at a density of 2x10 7 cells on the collagen - coated 215 15 - cm dishes ( Greiner - Bio - One ) . After incubation with tetracycline for 16 h , 216 GFP - positive RasV12 cells and GFP - negative MDCK cells were separated with an 217 analytical flow cytometer . Total RNA was extracted from the isolated cells using 218 Trizol ® ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) and the RNeasy Mini Kit ( QIAGEN ) and reverse 219 transcribed using QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit ( QIAGEN ) . GeneAce SYBR 220 qPCR Mix ( NIPPON GENE ) was used to perform qPCR using the StepOne TM system 221 15 ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . The primer sequences used are listed in Supplementary 222 Table 1 . We used β - actin as a reference gene to normalise data . 223 224 Lactate assay 225 For lactate assay , MDCK cells , MDCK - pTR GFP - RasV12 cells , MDCK - pTR 226 GFP - RasV12 LDHA - shRNA cells or 1 : 1 mix of MDCK and MDCK - pTR GFP - RasV12 227 or MDCK - pTR GFP - RasV12 LDHA - shRNA cells were cultured at a density of 6 . 5x10 5 228 cells on the collagen - coated 12 - well dishes ( Falcon ) in DMEM containing neither 229 phenol red nor fetal calf serum . The culture medium was replaced with fresh medium at 230 12 h after tetracycline addition and collected 12 h later . Samples were subjected to 231 measurement of lactate concentration using Lactate Assay kit ( BioVision ) . 232 233 HIF1 reporter assay 234 MDCK or MDCK - pTR GFP - RasV12 cells were co - transfected with pCDH / 5HRE - Luc 235 ( kindly provided by Dr . Hiroshi Harada ( Kyoto University ) ) and pRL - TK . After 24 h , 236 cells were trypsinised , and cultured alone or co - cultured with the indicated cells ( total 237 16 cell number : 3 . 5x10 5 ) for 8 h , followed by tetracycline treatment for 16 h . Firefly 238 luciferase activity was measured using Dual - Lucifease Reporter assay ( Promega ) and 239 normalized by Renilla luciferase activity . 240 241 Statistics and reproducibility 242 For data analyses , unpaired two - tailed Student’s t - tests were used to determine 243 P - values . P - values less than 0 . 05 were considered to be significant . No statistical 244 method was used to predetermine sample size . For animal studies , the experiments were 245 not randomized , and the investigators were not blinded to allocation during 246 experiments . All results were reproduced with at least two independent experiments and 247 at least three mice of each genotype .
