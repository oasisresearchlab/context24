AUTHOR ' S PROOF U N C O R R E C T E D P R O O F 1 23 4 Once more with feeling : Normative data for the aha experience 5 in insight and noninsight problems 6 Margaret E . Webb 1 , 2 & Daniel R . Little 1 & Simon . J . Cropper 1 7 89 # Psychonomic Society , Inc . 2017 10 Abstract Despite the presumed ability of insight problems to 11 elicit the subjective feeling of insight , as well as the use of so - 12 called insight problems to investigate this phenomenon for 13 over 100 years , no research has collected normative data re - 14 garding the ability of insight problems to actually elicit the 15 feeling of insight in a given individual . The work described 16 in this article provides an overview of both classic and con - 17 temporary problems used to examine the construct of insight 18 and presents normative data on the success rate , mean time to 19 solution , and mean rating of aha experience for each problem 20 and task type . We suggest using these data in future work as a 21 reference for selecting problems on the basis of their ability to 22 elicit an aha experience . 23 Keywords Insight problem solving . Creativity . Aha 24 experience 25 The feeling of sudden clarity and understanding , often accom - 26 panied by a sub - vocal or exuberantly shouted “ aha , ” is known 27 to many as insight in problem solving contexts . This feeling of 28 insight ( also known as an aha experience ) has been shown to 29 both improve motivation in problem solving ( Liljedahl , 2005 ) 30 and facilitate recall ( Danek , Fraps , von Müller , Grothe , & 31 Öllinger , 2013 ; Kizilirmak , Gomes da Silva , Imamoglu , & 32 Richardson - Klavehn , 2016 ) . Despite these benefits , finding 33 methods that reliably test insight is a recognised challenge 34 ( Bowden , Jung - Beeman , Fleck , & Kounios , 2005 ) . For in - 35 stance , although the investigation of insight has had a long 36 history ( Duncker , 1945 ; see , e . g . , Gilhooly & Murphy , 2005 ; 37 Jung - Beeman et al . , 2004 ; Knoblich , Ohlsson , Haider , & 38 Rhenius , 1999 ; Köhler , 1921 ; Maier , 1931 ; Metcalfe , 1986a ; 39 see also Sternberg & Davidson , 1995 ) , only a handful studies 40 have investigated which specific problems reliably elicit the 41 feeling of insight ( Davidson , 1995 ; Metcalfe , 1986b ; Metcalfe 42 & Wiebe , 1987 ) . Furthermore , those studies that have inves - 43 tigated insight problem reliability were predominantly con - 44 cerned with the subjective experiences ( e . g . , the feeling of 45 warmth to a solution ) leading to solution in insight and 46 noninsight problems . The goal of the present article is to pro - 47 vide a detailed investigation of the strength and reliability of a 48 range of problems used to elicit the cognitive processes and 49 affective components of insight in the individual solving the 50 problem . 51 Recent research in cognitive neuroscience has demonstrat - 52 ed that problems currently used as insight problems ( i . e . , com - 53 pound remote associates , remote associate problems , and an - 54 agrams ) can elicit insight and noninsight responses ( Aziz - 55 Zadeh , Kaplan , & Iacoboni , 2009 ; Bowden & Beeman , 56 1998 ; Kounios et al . , 2008 ; see Kounios & Beeman , 2014 , 57 for a review ; see also Luo & Knoblich , 2007 ) . However , these 58 studies investigate insight as a categorical response ( i . e . , par - 59 ticipants indicate whether the solution occurred to them 60 through insight or noninsight ) . Consequently , this method 61 does not reveal the strength of the aha experience elicited . A 62 more recent investigation ( Danek , Wiley , & Öllinger , 2016 ) 63 examined the strength of insight elicited by insight problems 64 but only for three classic problems , making the results difficult 65 to generalize . Here we test a wide array of different problems 66 using a continuous measure of insight strength .

Aside from evidence 69 indicating that the experience of insight is common ( Jarman , 70 2014 ; Ovington , Saliba , Moran , Goldring , & MacDonald , 71 2015 ) and thus of significant general interest , insight has been 72 associated with new and innovative thinking ( Feynman , 1999 ; 73 Poincaré , 1913 ; Schultz , 1890 ) , facilitated recall ( Danek et al . , 74 2013 ; Kizilirmak , Thuerich , Folta - Schoofs , Schott , & 75 Richardson - Klavehn , 2016 ) , improved learning 76 ( Dominowski & Buyer , 2000 ; Kizilirmak , Gomes da Silva , 77 et al . , 2016 ) , and increased motivation ( Liljedahl , 2004 , 78 2005 ) . For example , Kizilirmak , Thuerich , et al . ( 2016 ) pre - 79 sented participants with a series of compound remote associ - 80 ates ( a type of insight problem that has been increasingly used , 81 particularly in the cognitive neuroscience literature ) . Aha ex - 82 periences during encoding predicted a significantly higher 83 proportion of solutions to be both recalled and recognised 84 during subsequent testing , presumably due to the deeper 85 encoding afforded by the sudden realisation of the relation 86 between the word problems . To take a second example , 87 Liljedahl ( 2005 ) evaluated the impact of the aha experience 88 on motivation for learning mathematics ; students who had had 89 an aha experience became less anxious about mathematics and 90 more willing to continue through a problem solving process 91 until they had reached the solution . The investigation of in - 92 sight delves into the processes underlying these problem - 93 solving techniques , the understanding of which may aid crea - 94 tive problem solving , motivation in learning , and memory . 95 Defining Q1 insight 96 Definitions of insight can be approached in three ways : ( 1 ) the 97 process - based approach , which is concerned with the cogni - 98 tive processes involved in problem solving ; ( 2 ) the task - based 99 approach , which is concerned with identifying problems that 100 are capable of eliciting insight , with much of this approach 101 being used to determine insight problems that elicit insight 102 processes ( e . g . , Davidson , 1995 ; Metcalfe & Wiebe , 1987 ; 103 Weisberg , 1995b ) ; and ( 3 ) phenomenological approaches , 104 which are focused more on the feeling of insight ( Chronicle , 105 MacGregor , & Ormerod , 2004 ) . Both task and process ap - 106 proaches to insight require an understanding of the problem 107 space associated with each problem ; that is , the mapping of all 108 possible steps from an unresolved question or issue to the 109 solution . When the steps from one point in the problem space 110 to the next are clear , problem solving is able to progress in 111 steady , incremental , steps . However , in instances when the 112 steps toward solution are not clear , problem solving becomes 113 discontinuous ( Weisberg , 1995b ) ; that is , there is a need to 114 wait until further thought about the problem reveals or clar - 115 ifies the solution process , or until a mental restructuring oc - 116 curs ( Ohlsson , 1984 ; Sandkühler & Bhattacharya , 2011 ) . The 117 term restructuring implies that the way an individual perceives 118 or conceives a problem , and possibly the solution pathway , is 119 fundamentally changed ( Weisberg , 1995b ) . It is this sudden 120 restructuring that is presumed to elicit the phenomenological 121 component of insight ( Cushen & Wiley , 2012 ; Fleck & 122 Weisberg , 2004 ) . In contrast , from a problem - space perspec - 123 tive , a noninsight problem is a problem that does not require 124 restructuring because all problem - solving steps are known 125 from the outset , or at least follow logically from the first step . 126 Cognitive restructuring is a fundamental aspect of contem - 127 porary research on insight ( e . g . , Ash & Wiley , 2006 ; Cushen 128 & Wiley , 2012 ; Sandkühler & Bhattacharya , 2011 ; Weisberg , 129 1995a ) , which focuses on ( 1 ) the psychological response lead - 130 ing to and resulting from restructuring of a problem space 131 ( Ash & Wiley , 2006 ) ; ( 2 ) the use of heuristics ( Chronicle 132 et al . , 2004 ; Öllinger , Jones , Faber , & Knoblich , 2012 ) ; and 133 ( 3 ) progress monitoring ( in which a problem solver attempts 134 to minimize the gap between the current state of the problem 135 and the goal state ; see , e . g . , Jones , 2003 ; MacGregor , 136 Ormerod , & Chronicle , 2001 ) . In process - based approaches , 137 the solution of an insight problem is often presumed to indi - 138 cate insight , which in turn depends upon the definition of the 139 problem itself . 140 Task - oriented approaches to defining insight are similarly 141 concerned with designing or identifying those problems that 142 require restructuring for their solutions ( i . e . , insightful pro - 143 cessing ) . This is often achieved by creating a problem with 144 an initially uncertain or unusual path from problem to solution 145 ( i . e . , an ill - defined problem space ) , perhaps by encouraging a 146 faulty initial representation of the problem , through the over - 147 representation of problem constraints ( i . e . , subjects are en - 148 couraged to believe that the problem includes constraints that 149 are not there ) , infrequent word use , uncommon object use , or 150 suggestive instruction . Insight tasks ( insight problems ) are 151 then compared to tasks that require incremental solutions 152 ( see the supplementary materials for a selection of insight 153 and noninsight problems ) . 154 Finally , a phenomenological approach to defining insight 155 focuses on the experience of insight , including the emotional 156 components of that experience ( Danek , Fraps , von Müller , 157 Grothe , & Öllinger , 2014a ; Shen , Yuan , Liu , & Luo , 2016 ) , 158 and what might elicit or predict those feelings ( Topolinski & 159 Reber , 2010 ) . This area of research has grown abruptly in the 160 last decade , with a number of researchers noting the somewhat 161 circular reasoning of terming insight problems as “ problems 162 that require insight , ” and inferring that “ insight occurs when 163 insight problems are solved ” ( Öllinger & Knoblich , 2009 , p . 164 277 Q2 ) . To break this circularity , investigators have used self - 165 report to determine whether a given question has elicited an 166 experience of insight or otherwise ( Bowden & Jung - Beeman , 167 2003a ; Danek et al . , 2014a ; Danek et al . , 2016 ) . These self - 168 reports may be gathered either during problem solving ( e . g . , 169 Metcalfe & Wiebe , 1987 ) or directly after problem solving Behav Res JrnlID 13428 _ ArtID 972 _ Proof # 1 - 25 / 09 / 2017 AUTHOR ' S PROOF U N C O R R E C T E D P R O O F 170 ( e . g . , Bowden & Jung - Beeman , 2003a ; Danek et al . , 2014a ; 171 Kounios et al . , 2008 ) . In the present article , we have opted to 172 use the post - problem self - report scales developed by Danek 173 et al . ( 2014a ) , which are concerned with the phenomenologi - 174 cal components of insight ; namely confidence , aha experi - 175 ence , surprise , pleasure , impasse . 176 One of the most distinctive components of an experience of 177 insight is the aha experience . The aha experience has been 178 used as a synonymous term for insight ; it is generally de - 179 scribed as sudden , accompanied by strong emotional arousal 180 that may be either positive or negative ( Danek et al . , 2014a ; 181 Hill & Kemp , 2016b ; Shen et al . , 2016 ) , as well as a strong 182 sense of certainty in the reanalysis of the problem . A number 183 of researchers consider the aha experience to be definitive of 184 an insightful solution ( Cushen & Wiley , 2011 ; Gick & 185 Lockhart , 1995 ; Metcalfe & Wiebe , 1987 ) , or at least the most 186 indicative characteristic of insight problem solving ( Danek 187 et al . , 2014a ; Faber , 2012 ; Jung - Beeman et al . , 2004 ; 188 Schooler , Ohlsson , & Brooks , 1993 ) . 189 Much of the cognitive neuroscience literature on insight 190 has focused on validating the procedure developed by 191 Bowden ( 1997 ) , who solicited trial - by - trial judgments from 192 participants regarding whether a solution was derived through 193 a process of insight or through a process of analysis . Bowden 194 ( 1997 ) found that the conscious awareness of insight process - 195 es is related to unconscious processing prior to the experience 196 of insight ( i . e . , when solution words are presented subliminal - 197 ly , solutions are rated by participants as feeling insightful ) . 198 Subsequent research using this procedure has indicated that 199 the number of solutions that have involved insight varied with 200 distinct brain activations ( Jung - Beeman et al . , 2004 ; Kounios 201 et al . , 2006 ; Subramaniam , Kounios , Parrish , & Jung - 202 Beeman , 2009 ) , with specific areas associated with distinct 203 stages of preparation for problem solving . However , these 204 trial - by - trial procedures for measuring insight have consistent - 205 ly used binary or categorical classifications of response [ e . g . , 206 “ Was this problem solved : ( 1 ) with insight , ( 2 ) not with in - 207 sight , ( 3 ) unsure . ” ] ; consequently , investigating the potential 208 strength of the insight response has been curtailed by investi - 209 gating differences in physiological measures ( Hill & Kemp , 210 2016a ) . Although these ( hopefully ) should correlate , there is 211 no evidence that this is the case . 212 Finally , some researchers have considered the aha experi - 213 ence sufficient to define insight ( Gick & Lockhart , 1995 ; 214 Kounios & Beeman , 2009 ) , whereas others dissociate the 215 aha experience from the experience of insight ( Danek et al . , 216 2014a ; Sandkühler & Bhattacharya , 2011 ) , arguing that in - 217 sight comprises many components ( e . g . , surprise , confidence 218 and impasse ; Danek et al . , 2014a ) , of which a feeling of aha is 219 only one ( Danek et al . , 2014a ; Danek , Fraps , von Müller , 220 Grothe , & Öllinger , 2014b ; Klein & Jarosz , 2011 ) . Yet others 221 consider the aha experience to be a mere epiphenomenon of 222 restructuring the problem space ( Ormerod , MacGregor , & 223 Chronicle , 2002 ; Sandkühler & Bhattacharya , 2011 ; 224 Weisberg & Alba , 1981 ) . Irrespective of this debate , the aha 225 experience is a strong emotional marker that has been associ - 226 ated with new discoveries ( Feynman , 1999 ; Poincaré , 1913 ; 227 Schultz , 1890 ) , facilitated recall ( Danek et al . , 2013 ) , im - 228 proved learning ( Dominowski & Buyer , 2000 ; Kizilirmak , 229 Gomes da Silva , et al . , 2016 ) , and increased motivation 230 ( Liljedahl , 2004 ) . As such , it is worthy of study regardless 231 of whether it is necessary and or sufficient as an indicator of 232 an insight experience . In this article , we investigate the valid - 233 ity of a number of commonly used insight and noninsight 234 tasks by testing each problem ’ s ability to elicit insight . 235 Tasks used to elicit insight and their controls 236 Insight problems are designed to elicit a feeling of impasse , or 237 being stuck , by creating a problem with an uncertain or un - 238 usual path from problem to solution ( a so - called ill - defined 239 problem space ) . For example : 240241 A man is escaping from a 60 - m tower . He has a length of 242 rope that is 30 m long . He cuts the rope in half , ties it 243 together again , and uses it to escape . How does he do 244 this ? 245 The answer may or may not be immediately clear ; howev - 246 er , the solution becomes obvious if one thinks about cutting 247 the rope along its length rather than its width . 1 It is this sudden 248 clarity of solution and feeling of aha that is used as an indica - 249 tion of insight processes . However , the initial misinterpreta - 250 tion and consequent misrepresentation of problem space 251 varies across observers , as problem solvers are able to solve 252 these problems using both logical deductions and mental leaps 253 toward a solution ( Weisberg , 2014 ) Q3 . 254 In contrast , noninsight problems are designed to be solv - 255 able in a simple and incremental process , with a clear path 256 through the problem space from the initial problem to the 257 solution . A classic example of noninsight problems are 258 logic - based questions , though there are also many examples 259 using fluid intelligence tasks ( such as Raven ’ s Advanced 260 Progressive Matrices ; Raven , 2000 ) : 1 The rope / prisoner problem highlights some issues with scoring insight prob - lems . In this case , the more knowledgeable you are about rope , the more difficult this problem becomes . Since most common rope is made of three strands twisted together , the rope would be very difficult to cut in half length - ways . In this case , higher crystallized knowledge would be detrimental , highlighting the fact that although insight problems were developed in order to be answerable with the same level of prior knowledge , differences in prior knowledge will affect the ease with which one can generate a solution and , presumably , the experience of insight . For instance , a person with no prior experience with rope might experience insight at the solution , whereas a rope expert might or might not experience insight at realizing the problem required ignoring quite common properties of the rope ( e . g . , its twisted strands ) .

They were both 263 born in October . Four years ago , he was four times 264 older . How old are Bob and his father ? 265 The solution ( Bob is 12 ; his father is 36 ) requires basic 266 arithmetic ( 3 × 12 = 36 ; 36 – 4 = 32 ; 4 × 8 = 32 ) ; however , 267 although this question arguably requires simply stepping 268 through the arithmetic , it does require a problem solver to 269 remember their basic maths , and not to get caught by multi - 270 plying the three and four to get a 12 - year - old father , which is 271 actually a frequent response . Thus , the sudden memory of how 272 to solve the problem may result in a feeling of insight . The 273 tendency for problem solvers to solve insight problems using 274 both insightful and analytic methods and feelings was made 275 particularly clear in recent research by Danek et al . ( 2016 ) , 276 who tested three classic insight problems and found problem 277 solvers would solve these problems both with and without 278 insight affect . 279 Types of insight and noninsight problems 280 So far we have discussed predominantly “ classic problems ” 281 ( so dubbed by Cunningham , MacGregor , Gibb , & Haar , 282 2009 ) ; however , although these problem types were initially 283 the most frequently used , they have been superseded in recent 284 years by other problem tasks , such as compound remote asso - 285 ciates , anagrams , matchstick arithmetic , and rebus puzzles 286 ( Table 1 provides an outline of the problem types , along 287 with links to the studies introducing these into the literature 288 or to normative studies , where available ) . The majority of 289 research into the ability of insight problems to actually elicit 290 insight has been conducted on compound remote associates 291 ( see , e . g . , Jung - Beeman et al . , 2004 ; Kounios et al . , 2006 ; 292 Salvi , Bricolo , Bowden , Kounios , & Beeman , 2016 ; 293 Sandkühler & Bhattacharya , 2011 ; Wegbreit , Suzuki , 294 Grabowecky , Kounios , & Beeman , 2012 ) , but many of the 295 theories around insight processes arise from research in classic 296 problems ( see Sternberg & Davidson , 1995 , for a 297 comprehensive review of this literature ) . We next review clas - 298 sic insight problems and more contemporary insight problems 299 such as the aforementioned , compound remote associates ( but 300 also several other more contemporary problem types ) . 301 Classic problems 302 The example above ( i . e . , the rope problem ) is an example of a 303 classic insight problem . These are often riddle - type vignettes , 304 sometimes accompanied by images to create a spatial problem 305 ( see Supplementary Materials for list of problems and 306 solutions ) . Classic insight problems are typically described as 307 impossible to solve without restructuring ( Ash & Wiley , 2006 ; 308 Gilhooly & Murphy , 2005 ; Weisberg , 1995b ) . That is , 309 developing a mental representation of the problem that con - 310 siders the relations between the elements of the problem in a 311 way other than as presented Q22 . Weisberg ( 1995a , b ) developed a 312 taxonomy of insight and noninsight problems , based on the 313 degree of restructuring required , and whether or not a problem 314 was discontinuous ( whether a problem solver needs to change 315 direction / start again in order to proceed ) . This taxonomy out - 316 lines “ pure ” noninsight problems for which no restructuring is 317 required , “ pure ” insight problems , which are both discontinuous 318 and require restructuring , and hybrid problems , which are dis - 319 continuous and may require restructuring on a subject - to - subject 320 basis . Gilhooly and Murphy ( 2005 ) compared performance on 321 24 presumed insight and ten presumed noninsight problems in a 322 cluster analysis and found clusters that were congruent with 323 Weisberg ’ s ( 1995b ) taxonomy , including hybrid problems . 324 The other example presented above ( i . e . , Bob ’ s father ) is of 325 a classic noninsight problem , and a large literature has been 326 concerned with testing the procedural differences between 327 classic insight and noninsight problems ( e . g . , Gilhooly & 328 Murphy , 2005 ; Metcalfe & Wiebe , 1987 ; Weisberg , 1995b ) . 329 However , there are instances in which problems classified as 330 “ noninsight ” have been solved with insight - like feelings or 331 patterns of solution ( e . g . , Davidson , 1995 ; Webb , Little , & 332 Cropper , 2016b ) . For example , Davidson ( 1995 ) noted 12 – 333 13 % of noninsight problems were solved with the same 334 FOW ( feeling of warmth ) ratings as insight problems . Webb , 335 Little , and Cropper ( 2016a , b ) investigated a subset of classic 336 insight and noninsight problems , and found that , as with com - 337 pound remote associates , noninsight problems may also be 338 solved with feelings of insight . 339 Contemporary problems 340 In this context , we are distinguishing between classic and 341 contemporary problems in the following fashion : Classic 342 problems are riddles and puzzles drawn from literature and 343 discussed in literature before or during 1995 . Classic problems 344 predominately have a vignette component ( either as the en - 345 tirety of the problem , or accompanying a spatial puzzle ) , and 346 require at least 3 min on average to solve . In contrast , contem - 347 porary problems are those that have been developed or 348 discussed predominately after 1995 . These include problems 349 such as compound remote associates ( Bowden & Jung - 350 Beeman , 2003b ) , anagrams ( Kounios et al . , 2008 ) , and rebus 351 puzzles ( MacGregor & Cunningham , 2008 ) . We differentiate 352 these from classic problems as , though these problems have 353 been used in the cognitive literature prior to 1995 , they have 354 only been applied to the study of insight more recently ( see 355 Bowden et al . , 2005 , for a discussion on this topic ) . 356 Compound remote associates and remote associate tasks 357 Both compound remote associates ( Bowden & Jung - Beeman , 358 2003b ) and remote associate tasks ( Mednick , 1962 ) are short Behav Res JrnlID 13428 _ ArtID 972 _ Proof # 1 - 25 / 09 / 2017 AUTHOR ' S PROOF U N C O R R E C T E D P R O O F Table 1 Types of insight Q4 and noninsight problems , examples , and directions for further reading Type Description Category Example Example Papers Classic Problems Insight Riddle - type verbal / arithmetical vignette and figure Verbal Marrying man ( Davidson , 1995 ; Dow & Mayer , 2004 Q5 ; Gilhooly & Fioratou , 2009 ; Metcalfe , 1986a ; Metcalfe & Wiebe , 1987 ; Weisberg , 1995b ) Spatial Nine dot problem Mathematical Egg timer Noninsight Logic - type verbal / arithmetical vignette Verbal Dinner problem Spatial Cards Mathematical Water jug Contemporary Problems Ambiguous images / visual insight task Visual stimulus that can be interpreted in two ways Visual Necker cube ( Laukkonen & Tangen , 2017 Q6 ; Riquelme , 2002 Q7 ; Wiseman , Watt , Gilhooly , & Georgiou , 2011 ) Anagrams A scrambled word to be unscrambled into a meaningful word Verbal uctos = scout ( Bowden , 1997 ; Metcalfe , 1986b ) Analogies A verbal relations task in which two words with a relationship are presented , followed by a third word .

Concurrent research ( Bowden & Jung - 373 Beeman , 2003a ) provided evidence to validate the ability of 374 compound remote associates to elicit insight affect and pro - 375 cesses ; however , information regarding the probability of 376 experiencing insight was not provided . 377 Anagrams Anagrams are words that have been scrambled 378 and presented to a participant for solution ( e . g . , tpoil = pilot ) . 379 Metcalfe ( 1986b ) used these in her research investigating 380 insight - based and analytic - based ( i . e . , not involving insight ) 381 solutions .

However , steel body armour is too heavy , and unsuited for combat . People need a type of body armour that is both light and highly strong . Problem : How would you make body armour that is both light and highly strong ? Prototype : Spider silk is a type of bio - fibre , and is extremely light , yet has a high degree of strength , equivalent to 5 times the same volume of steel thread .

For 388 instance , Weisberg ( 1995b ) argued that anagrams were not 389 insight problems because they do not require restructuring 390 but rather are a simple vocabulary search task . 391 Nevertheless , a number of studies have used anagrams for 392 their ability to elicit insight ( e . g . , Aziz - Zadeh et al . , 2009 ; 393 Bowden , 1997 ; Jacobsen , 2016 ; Kounios et al . , 2008 ; 394 Novick & Sherman , 2003 ) . Although different studies have 395 provided conflicting information Q23 regarding the solvability of 396 anagrams ( e . g . , Novick & Sherman , 2003 ) , no normative data 397 have been collected for the degree of insight processes or 398 affect elicited by different anagrams . 399 Raven ’ s Advanced Progressive Matrices The logic pattern - 400 completion puzzles Raven ( 1985 ) developed in order to assess 401 fluid reasoning and problem solving abilities ( Little , 402 Lewandowsky , & Craig , 2014 ) have been increasingly used 403 as noninsight problems ( e . g . , Gilhooly , Fioratou , & Henretty , 404 2010 ; Paulewicz , Chuderski , & N ę cka , 2007 ) . Each task com - 405 prises a 3 × 3 figure matrix organised according to latent rules , 406 with the task being to deduce the latent rule and select one 407 answer from eight possible answers to complete the pattern . 408 Investigations by Gilhooly and Murphy ( 2005 ) indicate that 409 performance on Raven ’ s Advanced Progressive Matrices 410 ( Raven ’ s ) tasks form clusters with classic noninsight prob - 411 lems , yet the literature consistently demonstrates a positive 412 relationship between Raven ’ s and both classic insight prob - 413 lems ( Lin , Hsu , Chen , & Wang , 2012 ; N ę cka , Ż ak , & 414 Gruszka , 2016 ; Paulewicz et al . , 2007 ) remote associate tasks 415 ( Chermahini , Hickendorff , & Hommel , 2012 ; Paulewicz 416 et al . , 2007 ) . As yet , there have been no investigations into 417 the ability of these tasks to elicit insight or otherwise . Thus , we 418 will investigate their tendency to elicit insight or otherwise in 419 the present study . 420 Rebus puzzles MacGregor and Cunningham ( 2008 ) proposed 421 rebus puzzles as insight problems , obtaining a measure of self - 422 reported insight affect , and comparing performance on rebus 423 puzzles to the remote associate tasks . A rebus puzzle com - 424 bines words and visual cues to represent a familiar phrase 425 ( e . g . , SOMething = “ the start of something big ” ) . 426 Participants ’ base ratings of insight were higher in response 427 to rebus puzzles and remote associate tasks as compared to an 428 analogies task ( e . g . , “ sheep is to lamb as cow is to . . . ” = calf ) . 429 These results were interpreted as evidence that rebus puzzles 430 could be considered insight problems . However , MacGregor 431 and Cunningham did not obtain individual insight rating data 432 for their problem sets . Salvi et al . ( 2016 ) also used a set of 433 Italian rebus puzzles and found that solutions solved with 434 insight were judged to be correct more often than solutions 435 solved analytically . Salvi et al . replicated these findings for 436 anagrams and compound remote associates , but did not 437 provide data regarding ratings of insight . 438 Matchstick arithmetic Matchstick arithmetic problems were 439 proposed as insight problems by Knoblich et al . ( 1999 ) to 440 investigate the role of chunked information and restructuring . 441 In a matchstick arithmetic task , an incorrect equation is pre - 442 sented to a participant with matchsticks creating both numbers 443 ( Roman numerals ) and mathematical symbols . The task is to 444 make the equation correct by moving one matchstick ( e . g . , IV 445 = III – I ; answer , IV – III = I ) . In their experiment , Knoblich 446 et al . tested the degree of restructuring required by each type 447 of matchstick arithmetic ; however , they did not investigate the 448 phenomenology of insight . Recent investigations of the ability 449 of these tasks to elicit insight affect have provided mixed 450 results ( Danek et al . , 2016 ; Derbentseva , 2007 ) . 451 Magic tricks A novel method used by Danek et al . ( 2014b ) 452 was to investigate insight using magic tricks . In conjunction 453 with a magician , the researchers developed and recorded 40 454 short tricks , with only one effect and one method , which were 455 scored according to the degree of insight - related affect ( i . e . , 456 surprise , aha , impasse , confidence , and pleasure ) experienced 457 when watching the trick . Although the magic tricks may or 458 may not conform to standard definitions of insight problem 459 ( i . e . , restructuring ) , they evidently elicited insight . Since we 460 chose to investigate the most frequently occurring tasks in the 461 literature , we did not investigate magic tricks or rebus puzzles . 462 Aim of the present work 463 A number of the studies discussed above contain normative 464 data for the solution rate and response time of a variety of 465 different problem types ; however , there are currently no nor - 466 mative data on the strength and frequency of insight affect 467 elicited by these tasks . The ability of any of the above prob - 468 lems to elicit insight is not in dispute ; evidence indicates that 469 many problems can elicit insight for many persons , depending 470 on an individual ’ s focus and reason for problem solving 471 ( Klein & Jarosz , 2011 ; Ovington et al . , 2015 ) . It is the strength 472 of insight that is elicited across a range of problems that we 473 aim to investigate in this article , as well as the reliability of a 474 subset of problems to elicit insight . 475 General method 476 Across four studies , a total of 544 University of Melbourne 477 students ( 452 female , 92 male ; age range = 16 – 58 , mean = Behav Res JrnlID 13428 _ ArtID 972 _ Proof # 1 - 25 / 09 / 2017 AUTHOR ' S PROOF U N C O R R E C T E D P R O O F 478 20 . 34 ) completed insight and noninsight problem - solving tasks 479 coupled with various additional measures . The primary study 480 was conducted with 101 University of Melbourne students ( 72 481 female , 29 male ; age range = 17 – 58 , mean = 23 . 38 ) , who 482 completed the study for payment of $ 40 . Before beginning 483 the study , participants were provided with consent forms de - 484 tailing the proposed study . We advertised for participants with 485 English as a first language , as a number of problems required 486 high English proficiency and we have previously shown this to 487 be important ( Webb , Little , Cropper , & Roze , 2017 ) . 488 Materials 489 Classic insight and noninsight problems To generate a 490 dataset of classic problems , we conducted a systematic search 491 of the literature , and noted which problems were most fre - 492 quently used ( see the supplementary materials for search 493 terms and selection criteria , as well as the table detailing 494 which problems were used most frequently ) . 495 Problems were categorized as insight or noninsight prob - 496 lems on the basis of published categorizations and taxon - 497 omies . There were some contradictions in the usage of partic - 498 ular problems ( e . g . , trace problems have been used as both 499 insight and noninsight problems ) . In these instances , we clas - 500 sified each problem according to the cluster analysis per - 501 formed by Gilhooly and Murphy ( 2005 ) . 502 We selected the top 25 most frequently used insight and 503 noninsight problem . Accuracy and RT were recorded . We 504 provide normative data for the solution of these problems in 505 the Appendix . 506 Raven ’ s Advanced Progressive Matrices Participants com - 507 pleted the truncated Raven ’ s Advanced Progressive Matrices 508 ( adapted according to the method of Arthur & Day , 1994 ) , 509 which contains 12 test problems . These 12 problems were 510 randomly interleaved with classic insight and noninsight prob - 511 lems . Accuracy and reaction time were recorded , with norma - 512 tive data for the solution of these problems in the Appendix . 513 Compound remote associates We presented participants 514 with 34 problems , pseudo - randomly drawn from each 515 quantile in Bowden and Jung - Beeman ’ s ( 2003b ) dataset , en - 516 suring that the solutions would vary in difficulty and time 517 necessary for solution . Participants had 30 s to generate the 518 fourth word . 519 Anagrams We drew 34 five - letter anagrams from Novick and 520 Sherman ( 2003 ) . Each anagram was solvable within one - , 521 two - , or three - letter moves for the solution , with two - letter 522 moves being most common . 523 Procedure 524 Each participant was individually tested in four sessions . 525 Problems were presented online using Qualtrics ( Qualtrics , 526 2016 ) to present problems and record reaction times ( for 527 more detail on the resolution of reaction time measures in 528 Qualtrics , see Barnhoorn , Haasnoot , Bocanegra , & van 529 Steenbergen , 2014 ) . The problem - solving sets were 530 counterbalanced across participants . No solutions were given . 531 Problem - solving sets There were two problem - solving sets : 532 classic and contemporary problem solving , respectively . The 533 classic “ insight ” and “ incremental ” ( noninsight ) problems 534 were randomly interleaved within a set . Participants were giv - 535 en no information about whether the problem to be solved was 536 classified as “ insight ” or “ noninsight ” but were given 210 s to 537 work through the problem . In the contemporary problem set , 538 compound remote associate and anagram components were 539 counterbalanced . Five practice trials preceded each set . 540 Participants were given 30 s to solve each contemporary 541 problem . 542 Participants were given information on aha experiences to 543 respond in their ratings to each problem . A vignette describing 544 aha experiences ( drawn from Q24 Danek , Fraps , von Müller , 545 Grothe , & Öllinger , 2014a , b ; see the supplementary materials 546 for the vignette ) was presented at the beginning of the experi - 547 ment . After each problem solving task , participants were pre - 548 sented with the scales drawn from ( Danek et al . , 2014a ) . We 549 chose to use these scales as they individuate components of 550 insight from one another , and as a visual analogue they require 551 minimal processing . Participants were asked to rate : ( 1 ) the 552 confidence that the given response was correct ( very unsure to 553 very sure ) , ( 2 ) the strength of the aha experience ( very weak to 554 very strong ) , ( 3 ) the pleasantness of the insight experience ( very 555 unpleasant to very pleasant ) , ( 4 ) the surprising nature of the 556 insight experience ( not surprising at all to very surprising ) , and 557 ( 5 ) the feeling of impasse before the insight experience ( no 558 impasse at all to very stuck ) . Participants responded by moving 559 a slider ( preset at 50 ) along a scale of 0 – 100 . 560 Data analysis 561 Analyses were conducted using JASP ( Love et al . , 2015 ) and 562 R . Differences in the aha ratings across problem types were 563 investigated using a series of one - way ANOVAs , whereas the 564 correlation plots were created using the R package corrplot 565 ( Wei & Simko , 2016 ) . 566 Results 567 Problems were scored as either correct or incorrect and aver - 568 aged across category ( insight , noninsight , compound remote Behav Res JrnlID 13428 _ ArtID 972 _ Proof # 1 - 25 / 09 / 2017 AUTHOR ' S PROOF U N C O R R E C T E D P R O O F 569 associates , anagrams ) , as were the ratings of insight - related 570 affect ( see the supplementary materials ) . Descriptive statistics 571 for performance accuracy and the ratings of insight - related 572 affect are displayed in Table 2 . 573 We calculated the percentage of participants solving each 574 problem , as well as the mean time to solution , in seconds . We 575 also calculated the mean ratings of insight for each problem , 576 and then further investigated the mean ratings of aha experi - 577 ence by response accuracy . These data are presented in the 578 Appendix in descending order according to mean strength of 579 insight elicited in correct responses . 580 Relationships between problem types 581 We examined the relationships between problems used as in - 582 sight problems ( classic insight problems , anagrams , and com - 583 pound remote associates ) , and problems used as noninsight 584 problems ( classic noninsight problems and Raven ’ s 585 Advanced Progressive Matrices ) in terms of both accuracy 586 and the strength of the aha experience . 587 The correlations between problem types on ratings of aha 588 experience indicated moderate to strong positive relationships 589 across problem types , as can be seen above the diagonal in 590 Fig . 1 ( note that all relationships are above a Pearson r value 591 of . 4 and significant at p < . 001 ; below the diagonal are the 592 correlations for accuracy ) . This indicates that individual dif - 593 ferences may underlie the tendency to report a problem to be 594 solved with insight across both insight and noninsight prob - 595 lem types , as has been noted through the use of compound 596 remote associates and anagrams in the cognitive neuroscience 597 literature ( Bowden et al . , 2005 ; Kounios & Beeman , 2014 ) . 598 Performance accuracy The pattern of relationships across 599 problem types in terms of accuracy indicates significant pos - 600 itive relationships between classic insight problems and all 601 other problem types ( see the lower half of Fig . 1 ; also see 602 the supplementary materials for correlation statistics ) , as well 603 as significant moderate positive relationships between solu - 604 tion accuracy on anagrams and compound remote associates Table 2 Descriptive statistics of accuracy and insight related affect across problem types Problem Type Mean SD Insight Accuracy 0 . 30 0 . 16 Aha 42 . 04 16 . 44 Confidence 51 . 92 15 . 28 Impasse 57 . 56 14 . 29 Pleasure 48 . 94 14 . 48 Surprise 40 . 82 17 . 87 Noninsight Accuracy 0 . 57 . 18 Aha 50 . 45 17 . 18 Confidence 67 . 73 11 . 95 Impasse 47 . 19 14 . 86 Pleasure 58 . 71 12 . 84 Surprise 37 . 32 16 . 89 Raven ’ s Accuracy 0 . 57 . 20 Aha 54 . 50 18 . 93 Confidence 74 . 48 13 . 47 Impasse 42 . 27 16 . 43 Pleasure 62 . 66 14 . 49 Surprise 37 . 12 18 . 26 Compound Remote Associates Accuracy 0 . 34 0 . 18 Aha 39 . 58 17 . 07 Confidence 45 . 36 15 . 21 Impasse 65 . 17 16 . 53 Pleasure 43 . 63 14 . 64 Surprise 39 . 13 20 . 47 Anagrams Accuracy 0 . 78 0 . 16 Aha 64 . 17 18 . 64 Confidence 79 . 07 13 . 12 Impasse 38 . 13 21 . 01 Pleasure 66 . 93 15 . 82 Surprise 34 . 65 20 . 14 Fig . 1 Correlation plots between accuracy and aha across problem types .

The correlation plot was created using the R package corrplot ( Wei & Simko , 2016 ) Behav Res JrnlID 13428 _ ArtID 972 _ Proof # 1 - 25 / 09 / 2017 AUTHOR ' S PROOF U N C O R R E C T E D P R O O F 605 [ r ( 99 ) = . 51 , p < . 001 ] and between noninsight problems and 606 both compound remote associates Q25 [ r ( 99 ) = . 25 , p = . 01 ] . 607 However , accuracy on noninsight problems was not correlated 608 with anagrams [ r ( 99 ) = . 18 , p = . 07 ] . Furthermore , despite 609 significant positive relationships between Raven ’ s and both 610 insight [ r ( 99 ) = . 39 , p < . 001 ] and noninsight [ r ( 99 ) = . 56 , p 611 < . 001 ] problems , there were no significant relationships be - 612 tween Raven ’ s and either anagrams [ r ( 99 ) = – . 09 , p = . 39 ] , or 613 compound remote associates [ r ( 99 ) = . 06 , p = . 51 ] . This may 614 reflect the necessity of an extensive vocabulary for the solu - 615 tion of both compound remote associates and anagrams , 616 whereas Raven ’ s is a nonlexical solution . It also reflects some 617 of the complications of using these problem types inter - 618 changeably , as was noted by Ball and Stevens ( 2009 ) . 619 Differences between problem types for accuracy 620 and insight 621 We were also interested in whether particular problem types 622 ( e . g . , classic insight problems ) would elicit higher ratings of 623 insight experience , particularly , ratings of the aha experience . 624 If all problems considered to be insight problems can be used 625 interchangeably , we would expect a significant difference in 626 aha ratings for problems considered to be insight problems 627 ( i . e . , classic insight problems , compound remote associates , 628 anagrams ) as compared to problems considered to be 629 noninsight problems ( i . e . , classic noninsight problems , 630 Raven ’ s ) , and no difference between problem types within 631 insight or noninsight categories . A repeated measures analysis 632 of variance on ratings of aha experience across problem types 633 ( see Fig . 2 ) indicated a significant difference between problem 634 types on aha ratings : F ( 4 , 400 ) = 65 . 85 , p < . 001 , η 2 = . 40 . 635 Post - hoc comparisons showed no significant difference be - 636 tween insight problems and compound remote associates in 637 aha ratings . This implies that classic insight problems and 638 compound remote associates elicit , on average , ratings of in - 639 sight that are not significantly different from each other , which 640 is reassuring for a literature that is moving from the use of 641 classic insight problems to compound remote associates . 642 Similarly , no significant differences emerged between 643 noninsight problems and Raven ’ s in aha ratings , which may 644 indicate that Raven ’ s is a valid measure of noninsight problem 645 solving ; however , noninsight problems resulted in significant - 646 ly higher ratings of aha experience than both insight problems 647 ( p < . 001 , mean difference = 6 . 97 , Cohen ’ s d = 0 . 62 ) and 648 compound remote associates ( p < . 001 , mean difference = 649 10 . 02 , Cohen ’ s d = 0 . 55 ) . ( Similarly , Raven ’ s resulted in sig - 650 nificantly higher ratings of aha than either insight problems — 651 p < . 001 , mean difference = 11 . 17 — or compound remote 652 associates — p < . 001 , mean difference = 14 . 22 . ) These results 653 extend the findings of Danek et al . ( 2016 ) , who noted that 654 classic insight problems could be solved without insight , with 655 the finding that classic noninsight problems can be solved 656 with strong feelings of insight . 657 Finally , anagrams elicited significantly higher ratings of 658 aha experience than did all other problem types ( anagrams to 659 classic insight : p < . 001 , mean difference = 21 . 55 , Cohen ’ s d = 660 1 . 11 ; anagrams to compound remote associates : p < . 001 , 661 mean difference = 24 . 59 , Cohen ’ s d = 1 . 57 ; anagrams to 662 noninsight : p < . 001 , mean difference = 14 . 58 , Cohen ’ s d = 663 0 . 77 ; anagrams to Raven ’ s : p < . 001 , mean difference = 10 . 37 , 664 Cohen ’ s d = 0 . 48 ) . 665 Accuracy Given the process - oriented approach of interpreting 666 the correct solution of an insight problem as indicative of 667 insight , we performed the same repeated measures ANOVA 668 across problem types for solution accuracy ( see Fig . 2b ) . We 669 found a significant difference in accuracy across problem 670 types , F ( 4 , 400 ) = 222 . 40 , p < . 001 , η 2 = . 68 , with participants 671 being significantly more accurate at solving anagrams than at 672 solving all other problem types ( anagrams to classic insight : p 673 < . 001 , mean difference = . 47 , Cohen ’ s d = 2 . 30 ; anagrams to 674 compound remote associates : p < . 001 , mean difference = . 44 , 675 Cohen ’ s d = 2 . 66 ; anagrams to noninsight : p < . 001 , mean 676 difference = . 17 , Cohen ’ s d = 0 . 74 ; anagrams to Raven ’ s : p 677 = . 004 , mean difference = . 07 , Cohen ’ s d = 0 . 27 ) .

They also solved more 683 noninsight problems than either insight problems ( p < . 001 , 684 mean difference = . 31 , Cohen ’ s d = 1 . 81 ) or compound remote 685 associates ( p < . 001 , mean difference = . 27 , Cohen ’ s d = 1 . 27 ) . 686 We observed no significant difference between insight prob - 687 lems and compound remote associates in accuracy ( p = . 61 , 688 mean difference = . 03 ) . The results of accuracy reflect the 689 results of ratings of insight , and suggest a relationship between 690 accuracy and aha . The correlations between accuracy and aha 691 ratings ( see the supplementary materials , Fig . 1 , for 692 correlation plots ) indicate a significant relationship between 693 ratings of aha and solution accuracy for presumed insight 694 problems [ classic insight : r ( 99 ) = . 27 , p = . 006 ; compound 695 remote associates : r ( 99 ) = . 26 , p = . 008 ; anagrams : r ( 99 ) = 696 . 23 , p = . 02 ] , but no relationship for noninsight problems 697 [ r ( 99 ) = – . 10 , p = . 31 ] . 698 Ratings of aha experience conditional on performance 699 accuracy 700 Given the similarity in the patterns across problems of both 701 aha ratings and accuracy , we performed a series of analyses on 702 aha ratings conditional on whether the problem was correctly 703 solved ( see Fig . 3 ) . Looking at the aha ratings across problems 704 when the solution was correct revealed a significant effect of 705 problem type : F ( 3 , 69 ) = 29 . 56 , p < . 001 , η 2 = . 56 . Bonferroni 706 post - hoc tests indicated that anagrams elicited the highest rat - 707 ings of insight relative to other problem types , with signifi - 708 cantly higher ratings than classic insight problems ( p < . 001 , 709 mean difference = 16 . 08 , Cohen ’ s d = 1 . 11 ) or classic 710 noninsight problems ( p < . 001 , mean difference = 19 . 69 , 711 Cohen ’ s d = 2 . 35 ) ( anagrams were not significantly different 712 from compound remote associates when analyzing aha ratings 713 conditional on correct solutions : p = 1 , mean difference = 714 3 . 30 ) . Compound remote associates returned significantly 715 higher self - reports of aha experience than did either insight 716 problems ( p < . 001 , mean difference = 12 . 78 , Cohen ’ s d = 717 0 . 79 ) or noninsight problems ( p < . 001 , mean difference = 718 16 . 39 , Cohen ’ s d = 2 . 06 ) . 719 There was no difference between insight and noninsight 720 problems on ratings of aha for correctly solved problems ( p 721 = . 91 , mean difference = 3 . 61 ) . This suggests that the original 722 finding of significantly higher rating of aha experience for 723 noninsight problems may have resulted from consistently 724 higher ratings of aha for both correct and incorrectly solved 725 noninsight problems , whereas for insight problems , ratings of 726 insight were high only for correctly solved problems . ( We 727 found no significant difference between Raven ’ s and 728 noninsight problems : p = . 19 , mean difference = 4 . 94 . ) 729 Across all problem types , a significant difference in aha 730 ratings was apparent for incorrectly solved problems : F ( 3 , 731 69 ) = 11 . 68 , p < . 001 , η 2 = . 33 . Post - hoc comparisons indicat - 732 ed that this significance was driven largely by high ratings of 733 aha experience for incorrectly solved noninsight problems , 734 and low ratings of aha for incorrectly solved compound remote 735 associates ( p < . 001 , mean difference = 20 . 35 , Cohen ’ s d = 736 1 . 66 ) . There was , for instance , no significant difference be - 737 tween the aha ratings for incorrectly solved insight and 738 noninsight problems ( p = . 15 , mean difference = 8 . 02 , 739 Cohen ’ s d = 0 . 45 ) , nor between noninsight and Raven ’ s prob - 740 lems ( p = . 14 , mean difference = 6 . 78 , Cohen ’ s d = 0 . 62 ) . 741 Ratings of aha were also significantly higher for incorrectly 742 solved noninsight problems than for incorrect anagrams ( p = 743 . 007 , mean difference = 11 . 84 , Cohen ’ s d = 0 . 66 ) . Ratings of 744 aha in incorrectly solved compound remote associate problems 745 were also significantly lower than for classic insight problems 746 ( p = . 005 , mean difference = 12 . 33 , Cohen ’ s d = 0 . 86 ) . 747 Summary 748 We investigated aha ratings across a number of problem types , 749 investigating the relationship between aha and accuracy 750 through correlational analysis and analyses of variance . We 751 found that , when investigating the patterns of differences on Fig . 3 Mean ratings of aha experience across problem types as a function of accuracy .

However , in - 754 vestigating aha ratings across problem types conditional on 755 accuracy provided a different pattern of results . 756 Overall , anagrams were solved with the highest accuracy 757 and highest ratings of aha . Although compound remote asso - 758 ciates also elicited high ratings of aha , their low solution rates 759 mean they are dependent on measuring both accurate solu - 760 tions and ratings of aha experience . 761 Interestingly , classic insight problems and noninsight prob - 762 lems were not significantly different in terms of aha ratings 763 analyzed conditionally on response accuracy . Interestingly , 764 aha ratings were significantly higher in noninsight problems 765 when not conditionally analyzed . This is in strong contrast to 766 the use of noninsight problems as a control problem ( though 767 we recognize that noninsight problems are possibly effective 768 as problems that , more often than not , do not require 769 restructuring ) . However , we found a significant relationship 770 between accuracy and aha experience in presumed insight 771 problems ( compound remote associates , anagrams , and clas - 772 sic insight problems ) but no relationship with classic 773 noninsight problems . 774 We used the truncated Raven ’ s Advanced Progressive 775 Matrices ( Arthur & Day , 1994 ) as noninsight problems . This 776 enabled us to investigate reports of insight - related affect in the 777 solution of Raven ’ s matrices . There was a significant positive 778 relationship between Raven ’ s and all problem types regarding 779 aha experiences , and no significant differences between rat - 780 ings of aha in classic noninsight problems and Raven ’ s , de - 781 spite a significant difference in accuracy . 782 Reliability of classic insight problems to elicit insight 783 Reliability of insight : Method 784 In three additional experiments ( Webb et al . , 2016b ; Webb , 785 Little , Cropper , & Roze , 2017 ) , each with large sample sizes 786 ( N > 100 ) , we used a subset of the problems that we test here 787 using near identical procedures . This allowed us to investigate 788 the reliability of aha ratings conditional on accuracy across all 789 four experiments . The problem set procedure was identical to 790 the method already outlined in this article , with exceptions to 791 this procedure outlined below . The primary focus of these 792 three experiments were to investigate individual differences 793 in the tendency to report insight , and questionnaires were giv - 794 en to participants to complete as well as the problem solving 795 task , in counterbalanced order . 796 Study 1 797 Students from the University of Melbourne ( 193 : 118 female , 798 75 male ; age range = 17 – 52 , mean = 19 . 639 ) completed the 799 study for course credit . Nine participants were removed for 800 errors on more than 20 % of the tasks . 801 Materials 802 “ Classic ” insight and noninsight problems The following 803 problems were used in all studies : 804 Insight problems : triangle problem , socks problem , lilies 805 problem , antique coin problem , and egg timer problem 806 Noninsight problems : cards , water jug , trace , police , and 807 dinner 808 “ Contemporary ” insight problems : Compound remote as - 809 sociates We used 20 CRAs drawn from Bowden and Jung - 810 Beeman ’ s ( 2003b ) . 811 Questionnaires A series of individual differences measures 812 were presented in random order . These included the Oxford – 813 Liverpool Inventory of Feelings and Experiences ( O - LIFE ; 814 Mason & Claridge , 2006 ) , Raven ’ s ( 1985 ) Advanced 815 Progressive Matrices , a verbal fluency measure adapted from 816 Lezak ( 2004 ) , and an adaptation of the alternative - uses task 817 ( AUT : Guildford , Christensen , Merrifield , & Wilson , 1978 ) . 818 These measures are reported elsewhere in a follow - up study of 819 the same sample ( Webb , Little , Cropper , & Roze , 2017 ) . 820 Study 2 821 This data was collected individually online . A further aim of 822 this study was to investigate the effect of feedback on reported 823 insight . We only conduct our analysis on the responses taken 824 before the solution was revealed for each problem . The com - 825 parison of aha ratings before and after feedback is reported 826 elsewhere in a follow - up study of the same sample ( Webb , 827 Little , Cropper , & Webb , 2017 ) . 828 We found no significant difference in accuracy or aha rat - 829 ings between the study completed in lab ( Study 1 ) and the 830 study completed online ( Study 2 ) . 831 Participants A total of 129 undergraduates ( 88 female , 41 832 male ; age range = 17 – 45 , mean = 19 . 059 ) completed the tasks 833 for course credit . Twelve participants were removed for errors 834 in more than 20 % of the tasks . 835 Materials , procedure , and design The materials and proce - 836 dure were identical to Experiment 1 , save that participants 837 were given the solution to the problem after their initial 838 attempt . Behav Res JrnlID 13428 _ ArtID 972 _ Proof # 1 - 25 / 09 / 2017 AUTHOR ' S PROOF U N C O R R E C T E D P R O O F 839 Study 3 840 We expanded the individual difference measures in Experiment 841 3 to include measures of the big five and magical ideation . 842 However , problems and procedure otherwise remained the same 843 as Experiment 1 . The tasks were presented individually online . 844 Participants Undergraduates from the University of 845 Melbourne ( 130 : 106 female , 24 male ; age range = 16 – 47 , 846 mean = 19 . 60 ) completed the tasks for course credit . Four 847 participants were removed for errors in more than 20 % of 848 the tasks . 849 Reliability of insight : Results 850 Interexperiment reliabilities were calculated using Cronbach ’ s 851 alpha for each problem type . Ratings of aha experience for 852 correctly solved insight problems were highly reliable , with a 853 reliability coefficient of α = . 95 . Aha ratings for correctly 854 solved noninsight problems were moderately reliable , with α 855 = . 79 . For incorrectly solved problems , insight α = . 66 , 856 noninsight α = . 95 . The drop in reliability for aha ratings in 857 incorrectly solved problems is congruent with an accuracy - 858 related pattern of aha experience in insight problem solution ; 859 that is , feelings of insight were more reliably elicited in par - 860 ticipants who correctly solved insight problems . In contrast , 861 even incorrectly solved noninsight problems had a high reli - 862 ability in aha ratings ( i . e . , reliably low aha ratings ) . As is 863 presented in Table 3 , we investigated the average aha ratings 864 conditional on accuracy , as well as the problems that could be 865 dropped and increase the reliability of the ratings of aha expe - 866 rience . Within insight problems , the triangle problem was the 867 least reliable for aha ratings in both correctly and incorrectly 868 solved problems . Within noninsight problems , the police 869 problem was the least reliable in terms of aha ratings in both 870 correctly and incorrectly solved problems . 871 General discussion 872 We conducted an extensive investigation into the ratings of 873 insight elicited by problems frequently used as tests of both 874 creativity and insight ( classic insight and noninsight problems , 875 compound remote associates and anagrams ) . We recorded 876 measures of solution time , accuracy and ratings of aha expe - 877 rience . We also recorded insight - related affect ( e . g . , surprise 878 and confidence in solution ) . The ratings of self - reported in - 879 sight experience emphasize both the importance of judging 880 insight versus noninsight processes by the feeling in the solu - 881 tion rather than by task ( Bowden & Jung - Beeman , 2003a ) , as 882 well as using the continuous , strength - based , self - report meth - 883 od used in the present study . The results provide support for 884 the use of compound remote associates , anagrams , and classic 885 insight problems as problems that elicit insight ; however , they 886 urge caution for the usage of classic noninsight problems and 887 intelligence tests ( e . g . , Raven ’ s Advanced Progressive 888 Matrices ) as controls for insight problems . 889 Ratings of aha 890 The present results offer preliminary normative data for the 891 tendency of classic and contemporary insight problems to 892 elicit insight processes and affect . 2 This is particularly useful 893 given the increasing use of compound remote associates to 894 study insight , as existing normative datasets ( e . g . , Bowden 895 & Jung - Beeman , 2003b ) have so far not provided data regard - 896 ing the tendency of a particular problem to elicit insight affect , 897 only solution rates and reaction time . 898 Interestingly , ratings of aha experience for anagrams were 899 highest across all problem types ; both in the average of report - 900 ed aha experience and for the problems with correct solutions 901 only . This challenges the perception and use of anagrams as 902 noninsight problems ( e . g . , Gilhooly & Murphy , 2005 ; 903 Öllinger , Jones , & Knoblich , 2008 ; Weisberg , 1995b ) . For 904 instance , Weisberg ( 1995b ) was concerned that anagrams are 905 a simple memory search task , rather than requiring productive 906 thinking , and so are not true insight tasks . That same critique 907 applies to compound remote associates ( Cranford & Moss , 908 2012 ) , which demonstrably both elicit insight - related affect 909 ( Jung - Beeman et al . , 2004 ; Salvi et al . , 2016 ) , as well as dis - 910 tinct neurological processes when solved with versus without 911 insight affect ( Jung - Beeman et al . , 2004 ; Subramaniam et al . , 912 2009 ) . Interestingly , when analyzed conditionally on accura - 913 cy , we found no difference in aha ratings between correctly 914 solved anagrams and compound remote associates . This is 915 congruent with the work of Salvi et al . The high ratings of 916 insight affect in anagrams and compound remote associates 917 may be a consequence of the short solution time required , and 918 the single - word , unambiguous solutions , which may have 919 made the certainty of correct solutions higher and the sense 920 of aha greater ( Bowden et al . , 2005 ) . Consistent with this , the 921 vignette of Q27 Danek et al . ( 2014a , b ) describes insight as being 922 sudden and having a surety of the correctness . In contrast , 923 classic insight and noninsight problems have more ambiguous 924 problem components and solutions , which require holding 925 more information in mind simultaneously . 926 Despite noninsight problems being used as a control for 927 insight problems ( Ash & Wiley , 2006 ; DeCaro , Van 928 Stockum , & Wieth , 2016 ; Fleck , 2008 ; Murray & Byrne , 929 2005 ; Wen , Butler , & Koutstaal , 2013 ; Wieth & Zacks , 2 By “ insight affect ” we mean all of the possible components of the feeling of insight , such as surprise , impasse , confidence , pleasure , and the aha experi - ence . By contrast , “ aha experience ” is used to distinctly refer to our analysesof the aha experience ratings . We have adopted two terms because the aha expe - rience is arguably only one component of insight ( see Topolinski & Reber , 2010 , for a discussion on this topic ) . Behav Res JrnlID 13428 _ ArtID 972 _ Proof # 1 - 25 / 09 / 2017 AUTHOR ' S PROOF U N C O R R E C T E D P R O O F 930 2011 ) , no significant differences between classic insight and 931 noninsight problems emerged in ratings of aha experience for 932 correctly solved problems . Furthermore , there were actually 933 higher aha ratings in noninsight than in insight problems when 934 aha ratings were averaged over correct and incorrect re - 935 sponses . This may simply reflect the consistently higher aha 936 ratings for both correct and incorrectly solved noninsight 937 problems , whereas insight problems elicited insight predomi - 938 nately for correctly solved problems . These findings are con - 939 sistent with the thesis that insight problems might be solved 940 incrementally and noninsight problems might be solved in - 941 sightfully ( Bowden , 1997 ; Danek et al . , 2016 ; Weisberg , 942 2014 ) . These results call for the use of self - report in all studies 943 investigating insight affect and insight processes ( Bowden & 944 Jung - Beeman , 2003a ) until the components underlying the 945 phenomenology are better understood . 946 We investigated the truncated Raven ’ s Advanced 947 Progressive Matrices ( Arthur & Day , 1994 ) as noninsight 948 problems , examining the tendency for the solution of 949 Raven ’ s Matrices to elicit insight affect . Previous studies have 950 found significant positive relationships between Raven ’ s 951 Matrices and both classic insight problems ( Lin et al . , 2012 ; 952 N ę cka et al . , 2016 ; Paulewicz et al . , 2007 ) and the precursors 953 to compound remote associates , the remote associate task 954 ( Chermahini et al . , 2012 ; Paulewicz et al . , 2007 ) . The relation - 955 ship between Raven ’ s and insight problem solving has been 956 argued to reflect the necessity of fluid reasoning in insight 957 problem solving accuracy ( Paulewicz et al . , 2007 ) , and we 958 can extend this to note that accuracy is important for high 959 ratings of insight . We have provided data , moreover , to indi - 960 cate that the solution of Raven ’ s are able to elicit ratings of 961 insight that are not significantly different from those of classic 962 insight problems , which supports a dual - process view of in - 963 sight problem solving , in which insight can be considered as a 964 normal process , with special add - ons . 965 On accuracy and insight problem solving 966 We found positive relationships between accuracy and ratings 967 of aha in presumed insight problems ( classic insight problems , 968 anagrams , and compound remote associates ) , with substantially 969 higher aha ratings for problems with correct solutions . This 970 finding is consistent with the multi - level modeling conducted 971 by Webb , Little , and Cropper ( 2016b ) , which showed that in - 972 sight related affect ( i . e . , ratings of aha , confidence , and plea - 973 sure ) were predictive of solution accuracy . From a processing 974 perspective , this finding supports the idea that the solution of 975 presumed insight problems is designed to appear obvious once 976 the problem space has been restructured . Although this supports 977 the idea that restructuring results in an aha experience ( Salvi 978 et al . , 2016 ) , it is also commensurate with the idea that aha 979 reflects sudden confidence in an answer that is easily verifiable . 980 One valuable question raised by the present results ( and 981 previous results ; see Danek et al . , 2014a , b ; Webb et al . , 2016a , 982 b Q28 ) is whether there is a clear distinction between confidence and 983 the aha experience . The overlap between these constructs arises 984 from the language used to talk about insight . Descriptions typi - 985 cally used in the literature to describe an aha experience typically 986 emphasize the “ suddenness and obviousness ” of the solution 987 ( e . g . , Bowden & Jung - Beeman , 2003a ; Danek et al . , 2014a ; 988 Kizilirmak , Gomes da Silva , et al . , 2016 ) . The retrospective ob - 989 viousness of the solution is arguably linked to a subjective in - 990 crease in confidence . However , a high degree of confidence can 991 arise from slower , analytic problem solving as well ; consequent - 992 ly , the aha experience is distinguished from confidence in its 993 suddenness . This dissociation could be tested using ratings of 994 confidence and aha experience conditional on accuracy across 995 trials : if surprise distinguishes confidence and the aha experience , 996 then as solution accuracy becomes more reliable across trials , 997 feelings of confidence will increase ( e . g . , Peirce & Jastrow , 998 1884 ; Yeung & Summerfield , 2012 ) , and the aha experience will Table 3 Averaged aha conditional on correct solution of the problem across four experiments Problem Average aha : Correct solution Average aha : Incorrect solution Cronbach ’ s α ( if dropped ) Study 1 Study 2 Study 3 Study 4 Cronbach ’ s α ( if dropped ) Study 1 Study 2 Study 3 Study 4 Insight problems . 95 . 66 Triangle ( . 96 ) 73 . 87 62 . 18 72 . 52 74 . 07 ( . 56 ) 32 . 10 24 . 18 14 . 91 30 . 23 Socks ( . 97 ) 61 . 16 47 . 47 49 . 85 66 . 28 ( . 19 ) 30 . 69 29 . 23 25 . 72 42 . 92 Lilies ( . 92 ) 75 . 83 63 . 57 67 . 27 76 . 36 ( . 90 ) 26 . 28 25 . 54 35 . 41 30 . 44 Antique Coin ( . 92 ) 72 . 41 59 . 31 67 . 33 71 . 76 ( . 12 ) 38 . 40 31 . 26 31 . 11 43 . 69 Noninsight problems . 79 . 95 Cards ( . 73 ) 47 . 68 45 . 11 41 . 91 48 . 79 ( . 93 ) 33 . 25 22 . 29 21 . 15 37 . 18 Water Jug ( . 52 ) 61 . 90 52 . 23 48 . 95 66 . 07 ( . 94 ) 31 . 80 23 . 00 21 . 78 31 . 15 Police ( . 88 ) 41 . 26 36 . 33 36 . 09 54 . 36 ( . 98 ) 37 . 50 37 . 27 42 . 00 45 . 81 Dinner ( . 57 ) 46 . 28 48 . 28 50 . 54 51 . 12 ( . 93 ) 39 . 36 29 . 46 32 . 78 49 . 57 Behav Res JrnlID 13428 _ ArtID 972 _ Proof # 1 - 25 / 09 / 2017 AUTHOR ' S PROOF U N C O R R E C T E D P R O O F 999 decrease . Our present methodology unfortunately does not en - 1000 able us to make this distinction , since there was not sufficient 1001 control over the probable accuracy of response . 1002 Performance on classic insight problems , compound re - 1003 mote associates , and anagrams was positively correlated , but 1004 not between classic noninsight problems and contemporary 1005 problems ( Cinan , Özen , & Hampshire , 2013 ; Fleck , 2008 ; 1006 Gilhooly & Fioratou , 2009 ; Gilhooly & Murphy , 2005 ; Wen 1007 et al . , 2013 ; Wieth & Burns , 2000 ) . This finding could reflect 1008 differences in the underlying processes of solving insight 1009 problems ( i . e . , restructuring ) . However , performance on clas - 1010 sic insight and noninsight problems was also positively related 1011 ( see also Gilhooly & Fioratou , 2009 ) . This could reflect the 1012 similarity in the phrasing and presentation of the problems . 1013 Finally , performance on anagrams and compound remote as - 1014 sociates was related , and again is likely to be due to similari - 1015 ties in their structure : both were short verbal problems requir - 1016 ing high crystalized intelligence and verbal fluidity . The ab - 1017 sence of a relationship with accuracy on Raven ’ s Advanced 1018 Progressive Matrices is consistent with this supposition . 1019 Methodological implications 1020 The present work raises several issues regarding the way insight 1021 problem solving is studied . A well - recognized yet pervasive 1022 issue in the literature regards the use of small numbers of tasks 1023 in an experiment ( Bowden et al . , 2005 ) . For instance , 27 articles 1024 in the last decade have used a single insight problem to inves - 1025 tigate individual differences in insight problem solving . The 1026 rationale for using small numbers of problems is clear ; classic 1027 insight problems are highly diverse and have a low solution rate 1028 for any times less than 10 min ( Bowden et al . , 2005 ) . However , 1029 the present research highlights the potential problems inherent 1030 in using a single classic problem as a test of insightful problem 1031 solving : There are large differences in accuracy and in reported 1032 insight affect among all problem tasks and types . One way to 1033 ameliorate these issues is to use contemporary problems , such 1034 as compound remote associates and anagrams , which allow for 1035 a larger number of problems to be tested in a given time period . 1036 It is clear that insight problems , anagrams , and compound 1037 remote associates alike are able to elicit insight , and arguably 1038 both problem types require restructuring . However , it is im - 1039 portant to note that compound remote associates and ana - 1040 grams are distinctly different tasks from classic insight prob - 1041 lems in their cognitive requirements . For example , verbal 1042 overshadowing hampers classic insight tasks ( Schooler et al . , 1043 1993 ) but facilitates compound remote associates ( Ball & 1044 Stevens , 2009 ) . The present findings regarding the ability of 1045 compound remote associates and anagrams to elicit strong 1046 ratings of insight , particularly in the correct solution of the 1047 problem , reflects the fragmentation of methodology and find - 1048 ings arising from the different approaches to insight research , 1049 and reflect a need to consider once again what insight might 1050 mean ; whether it is reflected by a feeling , task , or process . 1051 Although normative data has been provided for many of 1052 these problems ( e . g . , Bowden & Jung - Beeman , 2003b ) , the 1053 data are predominately reaction times and solution rates . 1054 These are necessary statistics but given the rising interest in 1055 insight in problem solving and the lack of reliability of some 1056 problems in eliciting insight ( e . g . , Danek et al . , 2016 ; Webb 1057 et al . , 2016b ) , we offer this study both as an indicator for some 1058 problems in the literature and as a source to obtain problems 1059 that reliably elicit strong insight phenomenology . 1060 Author note This work was supported by ARC Discovery Project 1061 Grant DP160102360 to Daniel R .
