Introduction During cell migration , many membrane proteins undergo endo­ cytosis ( Caswell et al . , 2009 ; Bass et al . , 2011 ) and enter the endo­ somal network , where sorting mechanisms determine their fate . Initially , cargo proteins pass through the early endosome , where they are segregated between entry into the lysosomal pathway , leading to degradation , or recycling back to the plasma membrane or into the biosynthetic pathway ( Johannes and Popoff , 2008 ; Grant and Donaldson , 2009 ) . Sorting nexins are phosphoinositide­binding proteins that reside preferentially on early endosomes , where they are involved in diverse sorting processes ( Worby and Dixon , 2002 ; Carlton et al . , 2005 ; Seet and Hong , 2006 ; Cullen , 2008 ) . SNX17 ( sorting nexin­17 ) and SNX27 ( sorting nexin­27 ) have both been shown to mediate cargo retrieval away from the degradative pathway by associa­ tion with specific sequences within the cytoplasmic domains of target receptors ( van Kerkhof et al . , 2005 ; Lauffer et al . , 2010 ) . Here , we describe the development of a novel assay based on quantitative proteomics to allow an unbiased global identifica­ tion of the key transmembrane proteins that are retrieved from degradation by SNX17 . This revealed that depletion of SNX17 in HeLa cells resulted in lysosomal degradation of multiple members of the integrin family of extracellular matrix recep­ tors . We show that retrieval of integrins from the lysosomal pathway was caused by an interaction between the membrane­ distal NPXY motif of integrin  subunits and a noncanonical FERM domain within SNX17 . Consistent with enhanced degra­ dation , we present evidence that integrin recycling and cell sur­ face expression is severely impaired in SNX17­depleted cells , resulting in changes in cell migration . Results and discussion To establish a global view of cargo proteins that use SNX17 for retrieval from the degradative pathway , we developed a novel , unbiased method for the identification of transmem­ brane proteins that are specifically lost upon SNX17 RNAi­ mediated suppression . Because depletion of SNX17 results in reduced levels of the LRP1 ( low density lipoprotein receptor – related protein 1 ; van Kerkhof et al . , 2005 ) , we reasoned that other SNX17 cargo molecules should also display decreased T he FERM - like domain – containing sorting nexins of the SNX17 / SNX27 / SNX31 family have been pro - posed to mediate retrieval of transmembrane proteins from the lysosomal pathway . In this paper , we describe a stable isotope labeling with amino acids in culture – based quantitative proteomic approach that allows an unbiased , global identification of transmembrane cargoes that are rescued from lysosomal degradation by SNX17 . This screen revealed that several integrins required SNX17 for their stability , as depletion of SNX17 led to a loss of  1 and  5 integrins and associated a subunits from HeLa cells as a result of increased lysosomal degradation . SNX17 bound to the membrane distal NPXY motif in  integrin cytoplasmic tails , thereby preventing lyso - somal degradation of  integrins and their associated a subunits . Furthermore , SNX17 - dependent retrieval of integrins did not depend on the retromer complex . Con - sistent with an effect on integrin recycling , depletion of SNX17 also caused alterations in cell migration . Our data provide mechanistic insight into the retrieval of internalized integrins from the lysosomal degradation pathway , a prerequisite for subsequent recycling of these matrix receptors .

S1 E ) and the corresponding loss of Itg  5  1 ( R 2 value of 0 . 61 ; Fig . S1 F ) . In HeLa and other cell lines , Itg  1 exists in an immature Golgi resident form of  100 kD , which is not yet glycosylated , and a mature form of 130 kD ( Salicioni et al . , 2004 ) . If SNX17 mediates endosomal recycling of Itg  1 , depletion of SNX17 should not affect the newly synthesized immature form but only the mature form , which is subject to recycling . Knockdown with the three most efficient individual oligos ( 17­1 , 17­3 , and 17­4 ) did not lead to a loss of the im­ mature form of Itg  1 ( Fig . 1 E ) , whereas < 80 % of the mature form was lost with the most effective siRNA . In these experi­ ments , overnight treatment ( 18 h ) of the cells with bafilomycin restored Itg  5  1 levels to control levels ( Fig . 1 , F and G ) . The effect of SNX17 depletion was also manifested by a change in surface expression , as assessed by flow cytometry . SNX17­ depleted cells had drastically reduced levels of active and in­ active Itg  1 as well as Itg  5 at the cell surface ( Fig . 2 ) . An analysis of other integrin receptors showed that surface expres­ sion of Itg  3 and Itg  6 , both of which appeared as potential hits in our initial proteomic screen ( Fig . 1 A ) , was reduced . Itg  V and Itg  5 surface levels were also affected by deple­ tion of SNX17 , although the loss was more variable and not as pronounced as the loss of most of the  1 integrins ( Fig . 2 ) . To further confirm that depletion of SNX17 decreases inte­ grin stability , we performed degradation assays in cells treated with cycloheximide to block protein synthesis . Consistent with previously published data ( Lobert et al . , 2010 ) , Itg  5  1 was stable over the course of 7 h in control cells , in which inte­ grin is recycled rather than degraded ( Fig . 3 A ) . In contrast , Itg  5  1 stability was dramatically decreased in SNX17­ depleted cells . Biochemical internalization and recycling assays revealed that although Itg  5  1 was internalized at similar relative rates in SNX17­depleted cells ( Fig . 3 B ) , the return to the cell surface was severely inhibited ( Fig . 3 C ) . To identify the endosomal compartment where integrin recycling stalled in SNX17­depleted cells , we performed antibody­based recy­ cling assays . Although internalized antibody against inactive ( Fig . 3 D ) and active Itg  1 ( Fig . S1 G ) efficiently returned to the cell surface within 30 min in control cells , almost no anti­ body was recycled back to the surface in SNX17­depleted cells . Instead , internalized antibody accumulated in internal vesicles , which were absent in control cells ( Figs . 3 D and S1 E ) . An endosomal marker analysis revealed that the majority of these vesicles were EEA1­ and Rab4­positive recycling endosomes , whereas some were already Rab7­ or LAMP1­decorated late endosomes / lysosomes ( Fig . 3 E ) . No Rab5 and little Rab11 were detected on the vesicles . When lysosomal proteolysis was blocked by bafilomycin in SNX17­depleted cells overnight , a staining of Itg  1 and LAMP1 showed that most of the integrin had accumulated in lysosomes ( Fig . 3 F ) . Collectively , the data protein levels upon RNAi­mediated suppression of this sort­ ing nexin . We used stable isotope labeling with amino acids in culture ( SILAC ) to compare the abundance of membrane pro­ teins between SNX17­depleted and control HeLa cells . To ensure identification of SNX17­specific cargos , we compared SNX17­depleted and control extracts with extracts of SNX27­ depleted cells . HeLa cells were cultured in media containing light ( control ) , medium ( SNX17 ) , and heavy ( SNX27 ) amino acids for 2 wk . Treatment with siRNA efficiently reduced the expression of SNX17 and SNX27 ( Fig . S1 A ) . A crude mem­ brane extract was prepared from the cells , and the relative abundance of membrane proteins was analyzed by quantita­ tive mass spectrometry ( MS ) . The table in Fig . 1 A lists all membrane proteins that suffered a reduction in abundance of threefold or greater in SNX17­depleted cells but were not grossly altered in SNX27­depleted extracts . Importantly , we detected a pronounced loss of LRP1 specifically in the SNX17­ depleted cells , which supported the validity of our proteomics approach . Surprisingly , several integrin receptors , most nota­ bly Itg  5 ( integrin  5 ) and Itg  1 ( integrin  1 ) , appeared to be present at much lower levels in the SNX17­depleted extracts . Itg  6 ( integrin  6 ) and Itg  3 ( integrin  3 ) were also among the proteins that were detected at much lower levels in SNX17­ depleted cells ( Fig . S1 B lists all detected integrins and their SILAC ratios ) . To test whether integrins were lost because of enhanced lysosomal degradation , we analyzed the level of Itg  5  1 in SNX17­ and SNX27­depleted cells treated with and without bafilomycin A , which blocks lysosomal degradation by inhib­ iting endosomal acidification ( Huss and Wieczorek , 2009 ) . In confirmation of the proteomics data , we detected a pronounced loss of Itg  1 in SNX17­depleted cells ( Fig . 1 B ) . As indicated by our proteomics data , Itg  5 was lost from SNX17­depleted cells but also from cells treated with SNX27 siRNA . However , bafilomycin rescued only the effect of SNX17 depletion on Itg  5 and Itg  1 levels ( Fig . 1 B ) , whereas the loss of Itg  5 in SNX27­depleted cells was not affected by bafilomycin treat­ ment , suggesting alterations at the transcriptional level . Because of this , we did not further investigate the relationship be­ tween SNX27 and Itg  5 . Further RNAi experiments with four different siRNA oligonucleotides ( oligos ) against SNX17 confirmed the loss of Itg  5  1 under SNX17­suppressed condi­ tions ( Fig . 1 C ) , which could be reversed by bafilomycin treat­ ment for all individual oligos . Quantitative PCR confirmed that the loss of Itg  5  1 in SNX17­depleted cells was not caused by transcriptional down­regulation ( Fig . S1 C ) . Quantification of integrin protein levels revealed that < 80 % of Itg  5 and < 60 % of total Itg  1 were lost from SNX17­depleted cells and could be rescued by bafilomycin treatment ( Figs . 1 D and S1 D ) . We saw a clear correlation between the levels of SNX17 suppression treatment with 100 nM bafilomycin A prevents loss of integrins in SNX17 - and SNX27 - depleted cells .

When over­ expressed in HEK293 cells , the isolated cytoplasmic tail of Itg  1 fused to an N­terminal GFP tag efficiently precipitated endoge­ nous SNX17 . In contrast , the cytoplasmic tails of Itg  5 or Itg  V failed to coprecipitate SNX17 , suggesting that SNX17 binds the  subunit of the integrin heterodimer ( Fig . 4 D ) . In support of this , SNX17 also coprecipitated with the isolated Itg  5 cyto­ domain ( Fig . 4 E ) , demonstrating that SNX17 retrieves integrin heterodimers from degradation by targeting the  subunit . As SNX17 contains a C­ t erminal noncanonical FERM­ l ike do­ main that engages cargo by binding to tyrosine­based motifs ( Stockinger et al . , 2002 ; Burden et al . , 2004 ; van Kerkhof et al . , 2005 ; Ghai et al . , 2011 ) , we tested whether SNX17 binds to the  integrin NPXY motifs by substituting the critical tyrosine residues within the two NPXY motifs in the Itg  1 and  5 cytoplasmic tail . Indeed , mutation of the membrane­distal suggested that in SNX17­depleted cells , Itg  1 recycling stalls in EEA1 / Rab4­positive recycling endosomes followed by aber­ rant missorting into lysosomes . Consistent with a role of SNX17 in recycling from early or sorting endosomes , SNX17­GFP colocalized almost completely with EEA1 but could not be detected on LAMP1­positive lyso­ somes ( Fig . S2 A ) . In antibody uptake assays , internalized Itg  1 colocalized with SNX17­GFP on EEA1­positive endosomes as early as 2 . 5 min after internalization ( Figs . 4 A and S2 A ) . This was independent of the activity state of Itg  1 , as we observed strong colocalization with total ( K20 ) , active ( TS2 / 16 ) , and inactive ( P5D2 ) Itg  1 ( Fig . S3 A ) . Immunoprecipitation of endogenous Itg  1 coprecipitated endogenous SNX17 , although the signal was only barely above background , indicating low stoichiometry and / or affinity between SNX17 and the inte­ grin ( Fig . 4 B ) .

Furthermore , treatment with bafilomycin restored the mature 130­kD band of the Y795A mutated integrin ( Fig . 5 C ) . Finally , we asked whether SNX17 depletion affected focal adhesion formation and migration . Depletion of SNX17 in fibroblasts led to an almost complete loss of mature Itg  1 and to a 70 % loss of Itg  5 but only to a slight reduction in Itg  V levels ( Fig . 5 D ) . The fall in integrin levels caused a reduction in total focal adhesion area and mean adhesion size in fibro­ blasts spread on fibronectin ( Fig . 5 E ) . When migration through a fibrillar cell­derived matrix was analyzed , SNX17­depleted fibroblasts and HeLa cells both demonstrated increased direc­ tional persistence and increased speed ( Figs . 5 F and S3 D and Video 1 ) . Changes in speed and persistence are consistent with a shift from Itg  5  1­mediated to Itg  V  3­mediated adhesion . Antibody inhibition of Itg  5  1 has been shown to increase per­ sistence of migration as the cell relies on Itg  V  3 ( White et al . , 2007 ) . Furthermore , large Itg  5  1­rich adhesions have been found to act as static structures , whereas small Itg  V  3­rich adhesions promote cell migration ( Roca­Cusachs et al . , 2009 ) , meaning that reduction of adhesion area and Itg  5  1 levels would both contribute to fast , persistent migration . Collectively , the data presented herein have established that our novel proteomic approach is a useful tool for the global identification of transmembrane cargos of endosomal sorting adaptors . In the context of SNX17 , it allowed an unbiased iden­ tification of several integrins as cargo molecules for this sorting nexin . This approach could therefore be used to identify novel cargo for other endosomal sorting complexes , such as the retromer complexes ( Arighi et al . , 2004 ; Carlton et al . , 2004 ; Seaman , 2004 ; Wassmer et al . , 2007 , 2009 ; Harterink et al . , 2011 ; Cullen and Korswagen , 2012 ) , further sorting nexins , or other endosomal proteins that are involved in the retrieval of cargo away from the lysosomal pathway . Our data have established that SNX17 is required for the efficient recycling of Itg  5  1 from an EEA1 / Rab4­positive compartment , where direct bind­ ing of SNX17 to the membrane­distal NPXY motif prevents an entry into the degradative pathway . With regard to the mecha­ nistic basis of SNX17­mediated lysosomal retrieval , it appears that SNX17 , unlike its family member SNX27 , is not an adaptor for the retromer complex . To our knowledge , SNX17 is the first integrin­associated protein whose loss results in the lysosomal degradation of integrins . Although several other proteins , includ­ ing ACAP1 ( Li et al . , 2005 ) and EHD1 ( Jovi ć et al . , 2007 ) , have been shown to be required for integrin recycling ( Margadant , et al . , 2011 ) , all of these recycling processes take place at a later stage in the endosomal network . Hence , loss of function of these proteins causes an accumulation of Itg  1 in intracellular vesi­ cles but no overall loss of these receptors . A recent study found enhanced lysosomal degradation of Itg  1 when syntaxin 6 func­ tion was disrupted ( Tiwari et al . , 2011 ) ; however , this is probably NPXY motif blocked coprecipitation of SNX17 with the GFP­ tagged Itg  1 and  5 cytoplasmic tail ( Fig . 4 F ) . In vitro trans­ lated wild­type and Y783A , but not the Y795A , cytoplasmic domain also precipitated the in vitro translated mCherry­tagged SNX17­FERM domain ( Fig . 4 G ) , indicating direct binding . Conversely , mCherry­tagged SNX17 and the mCherry­tagged FERM­like domain , but not the  FERM protein , precipitated the wild­type and Y783A­mutated Itg  1 cytoplasmic tail but not the Y795A protein ( Fig . 4 H ) . Collectively , these data dem­ onstrate that SNX17 retrieves integrins from the lysosomal deg­ radative pathway by binding of its FERM­like domain to the membrane­distal NPXY motif of the  subunit . As the distal NPXY motif is also the binding site for the focal adhesion – associated Kindlin proteins ( Moser et al . , 2009 ) , both pro­ teins could compete for this site . However , we did not detect Kindlin­2 on SNX17­GFP – labeled endosomes that contained Itg  1 ( Fig . S3 B ) , suggesting that these proteins function in spatially segregated compartments . SNX17 is closely related to SNX27 ( Ghai et al . , 2011 ) , which binds indirectly to the retromer complex via the actin nucleation – promoting Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein and scar homolog ( WASH ) complex ( Temkin et al . , 2011 ) that has recently also been shown to be required for Itg  5  1 recycling ( Zech et al . , 2011 ) . Moreover , there are existing links between SNX17 and the retromer complex , as both have been shown to be involved in the trafficking of the Alzheimer’s­related APP protein ( Lee et al . , 2008 ; Muhammad et al . , 2008 ; Lane et al . , 2010 ) . This caused us to ask whether SNX17 also links cargo recog­ nition of the integrin NPXY motifs to retromer carrier forma­ tion through an association with the WASH complex . SNX17 did not precipitate members of the WASH complex , whereas SNX27 efficiently precipitated the WASH complex compo­ nents WASH1 , FAM21 , and Strumpellin ( Fig . 4 I ; Gomez and Billadeau , 2009 ) . Moreover , depletion of the retromer subunits VPS26 or VPS35 as well as suppression of retromer­associated sorting nexins , SNX1 , SNX2 , SNX5 , and SNX6 ( Wassmer et al . , 2007 , 2009 ) , did not result in a loss of Itg  5  1 ( Fig . 4 J ) , indicat­ ing that retrieval of integrins does not rely on SNX17 engag­ ing the retromer complex . As SNX17 rescues integrins from lysosomal degrada­ tion by binding to the membrane­distal tyrosine motif , we next asked whether mutation of Y795 in Itg  1 would phenocopy the effect of SNX17 depletion . Y783 and Y795 in full­length human Itg  1 were mutated to alanine and the respective constructs were lentivirally expressed in immortalized Itg  1  /  MEFs . Strikingly , the Y795A , but not the Y783A , mutation led to a dramatic change in subcellular localization , as most of the inac­ tive ( Fig . 5 A ) and active ( Fig . S3 C ) Itg  1­Y795A accumulated in LAMP1­positive lysosomes . In agreement with the observed mislocalization to lysosomes , degradation assays revealed that the mature form of Itg  1­Y795A mutant was quickly degraded , cytoplasmic tails with Y motif mutations and the in vitro translated mCherry - tagged SNX17 - FERM domain .

The rabbit polyclonal antibody against SNX17 was a gift from G . Bu ( Washington University , St . Louis , MO ) . Monoclonal integrin antibodies for the FACS analysis were K20 against total  1 ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Inc . ) , TS2 / 16 against active  1 ( Santa Cruz Biotechnol - ogy , Inc . and BioLegend ) , P5D2 against inactive Itg  1 ( Santa Cruz Bio - technology , Inc . ) , Itg  5 ( AST - 3T ; BioLegend ) , Itg  1 ( MAB 1973 ; Millipore ) , Itg  3 ( MCA1948T ; AbD Serotec ) , Itg  5 ( NKI - SAM1 ; BioLegend ) , Itg  6 ( MCA1457 ; AbD Serotec ) , and Itg  V ( 17E6 ; EMD ) . For Western blotting , the following were used : anti - CD29 ( 610467 ; BD ) for Itg  1 Western blotting and rabbit polyclonal against Itg  5 ( SC - 10729 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Inc . ) .

Billadeau ( Mayo Clinic , Rochester , MN ) . The rabbit polyclonal antibody against Strumpellin as well as the goat polyclonal antibody against EEA1 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Inc . Migration analysis Cell - derived matrices were generated by culturing confluent fibroblasts for 10 d before removing the fibroblasts by NH 4 OH lysis . For migration , control or SNX17 knockdown cells were seeded at 5 , 000 cells / ml and allowed to spread for 4 h before capturing time - lapse images at 10 - min intervals for 10 h on a microscope ( AS MDW ; Leica ) using a 5× / 0 . 15 NA Fluotar objective and a charge - coupled device camera ( CoolSNAP HQ ; Roper Scientific ) . The migration paths of all nondividing , nonclustered cells were tracked using ImageJ software ( National Institutes of Health ) , and persistence was deter - mined by dividing linear displacement of a cell over 10 h by the total dis - tance migrated . Flow cytometry For the detection of surface integrins , HeLa cells were transfected with scrambled and SNX17 siRNA 72 h before harvest of the cells . The cells not specific for a class of cargo , as a loss of endosomal SNARE function will most likely perturb endosomal function in general . Collectively , our data establish that the membrane­distal NPXY motif of Itg  1 and possibly other  integrins serves as a lyso­ somal avoidance signal by engaging the FERM­like domain of SNX17 on early endosomes , thereby enabling entry into recy­ cling pathways further downstream . Materials and methods Tissue culture HeLa and RPE1 cells were cultured in DME under standard conditions . Human fibroblasts were cultured in DME supplemented with 15 % FBS , 4 . 5 g / liter glucose , 25 mM Hepes , and 2 mM l - glutamine . Immortalized Itg  1  /  MEF cells were cultured at 33°C in DME supplemented with 10 % FBS and interferon  . For the SILAC experiments , HeLa cells were cultured in control , R6K4 , and R10K8 DME medium ( Dundee Cell Products ) supple - mented with 10 % dialyzed FBS ( Dundee Cell Products ) . Viral expression of GFP - tagged Rab proteins and human Itg  1 The human Itg  1 cDNA clone was obtained from OriGene and subcloned into pcDNA 3 . 1 using a primer for the wild - type protein as well as one with the Y795A mutation . The Y783A mutation was introduced into the wild - type sequence with site - directed mutagenesis . From pcDNA3 . 1 , the Itg  1 sequence was transferred into the pXLG3 lentiviral expression plasmid , and lentivirus was produced in HEK293 cells . The Itg  1  /  MEFs were cul - tured in the HEK293 - conditioned media containing the respective viruses for 4 d . For Rab - GFP expression , HeLa cells were exposed to lentivirus expressing the respective rab proteins at low levels for 3 d followed by culturing for 1 wk before further experiments . SILAC experiments HeLa cells were cultured in 6 - well plates for 2 wk in R0K0 control , R6K4 , and R6K10 media supplemented with 10 % dialyzed FBS ( media and FBS were obtained from Dundee Cell Products ) . 200 , 000 cells per well of a 6 - well plate were reverse transfected with scrambled ( R0K0 ) , SNX17 ( R6K4 ) , and SNX27 ( R10K8 ) siRNA oligos ( ON - TARGETplus SMARTpool ; Thermo Fisher Scientific ) with reagent ( HiPerFect ; QIAGEN ) according to the man - ufacturer’s reverse transfection protocol . 14 h after the first transfection , cells were transfected again using the manufacturer’s standard protocol . The cells were then incubated another 60 h . For the liquid chromatogra - phy – MS analysis of membrane proteins , the cells were detached from the culture dishes with 5 mM EDTA in PBS for 20 min . To verify the efficacy of the siRNA treatment , a fraction of the cells was lysed in standard lysis buffer and subjected to control Western blotting of SNX17 and SNX27 . From the remaining cells , a crude membrane extract was obtained with a sub - cellular fractionation kit ( QProteome ; QIAGEN ) . The resulting membrane frac - tions were resolved on precast PAGE gels ( NuPAGE 4 – 12 % ; Invitrogen ) stained with colloidal Coomassie ( SimplyBlue SafeStain ; Invitrogen ) fol - lowed by quantification of the amount of protein with a scanner ( Odyssey ; LI - COR Biosciences ) . The samples were then pooled in ratios according to the protein quantification , resolved by SDS - PAGE , stained with colloi - dal Coomassie , and analyzed by liquid chromatography – MS / MS - based quantification . For that , the lane was subjected to “gel walking” and cut into 10 slices , all of which were subsequently subjected to in - gel tryptic digestion using an automated digestion unit ( ProGest ; Digilab UK ) . The resulting peptides were fractionated using a nano - HPLC system ( UltiMate 3000 ; Dionex ) . In brief , peptides in 1 % ( vol / vol ) formic acid were injected onto a C18 nanotrap column ( Acclaim PepMap ; Dionex ) . After washing with 0 . 5 % ( vol / vol ) acetonitrile , 0 . 1 % ( vol / vol ) formic acid peptides were resolved on a 250 mm × 75 – µm C18 reverse - phase analytical column ( Acclaim PepMap ) over a 120 - min organic gradient with a flow rate of 300 nl / min  1 .

For the analysis of the antibody returned to the surface , cells were washed in ice - cold PBS , fixed in cold 4 % PFA for 20 min , blocked with 1 % BSA in PBS for 10 min , and incubated with anti – mouse Alexa Fluor 594 for 30 min followed by washing and incubation in 0 . 1 % saponin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) in PBS with DAPI dye . For the analysis of internal integrin , cells were subjected to a second acid rinse after the 30 - min chase period to remove recycled antibody from the surface . Cells were then fixed , permea - bilized with 0 . 1 % saponin , and stained with anti – mouse Alexa Fluor 594 and DAPI . For the endosomal marker analysis , the same antibody - based assay was performed with the P5D2 antibody in either wild - type HeLa cells ( EEA1 and LAMP1 ) or in HeLa cells with lentiviral expression of Rab4 , Rab5 , Rab7 , and Rab11 - GFP . After the second acid rinse , cells were fixed in cold PFA , permeabilized with 0 . 1 % saponin , blocked with 1 % BSA in PBS , and stained with antibodies against EEA1 and LAMP1 . Represen - tative images were then taken on a confocal laser - scanning microscope ( SP5 AOBS ; Leica ) attached to an inverted epifluorescence microscope ( DMI6000 ; Leica ) . All images were subjected to removal of noise with Volocity ( PerkinElmer ) , and where needed , brightness was increased uni - formly using Photoshop ( Adobe ) . Integrin degradation assays HeLa cells were transfected with scrambled or SNX17 siRNA in 12 - well plates and incubated for 72 h , and cycloheximide at 10 µg / ml was added to the cells for the indicated time points . Cells were lysed in PBS with 1 % vol / vol Triton X - 100 , and integrin levels were determined by quantitative Western blotting .  - Actin fluorescence intensity was used to normalize the detected levels of integrins . The untreated control was set to 100 % , and the level of detected integrins was calculated as the percentage of untreated control for each time point . The same procedure was used for the Itg  1 degradation assay in the Itg  1  /  MEFs with lentiviral reexpres - sion of human Itg  1 constructs . Antibody uptake and colocalization assay Human retinal pigment epithelium ( RPE1 ) cells were transduced with a len - tivirus expressing GFP - SNX17 . The cells were incubated with a monoclonal antibody against active Itg  1 at 2 µg / ml for 1 . 5 h , fixed , permeabilized , and stained with DAPI and an Alexa Fluor 488 – coupled secondary anti - body against mouse IgG . Image analysis was then performed with the aforementioned laser - scanning microscope ( SP5 AOBS ) . LAMP1 and Itg  1 colocalization assay HeLa cells were transfected with scrambled and SNX17 siRNA and incu - bated for 60 h . The cells were then treated with 100 nM bafilomycin A for 14 h , fixed , permeabilized with 0 . 1 % saponin , and stained for Itg  1 ( TS2 / 16 ) and LAMP1 . Colocalization analysis was performed on the con - focal section showing maximum LAMP1 signal using Volocity image analy - sis software . Thresholds were generated with the Volocity auto threshold function . Pearson’s correlation as well as the percentage of colocalization of integrin and LAMP1 signal was calculated from eight images taken from two independent experiments . Immunoprecipitation experiments Endogenous Itg  1 was precipitated from HeLa cell extracts ( two 150 - mm dishes in 1 ml of 50 - mM Tris - HCL with 0 . 5 % vol / vol NP - 40 and protease inhibitor cocktail ) with 10 µg antibody ( TS2 / 16 or anti - GFP as a control antibody ) and protein G – agarose under shaking for 3 h at 4°C . The pre - cipitates were analyzed for the presence of endogenous SNX17 by Western blotting . The isolated cytoplasmic tails of the respective integrins were cloned from HeLa cDNA and ligated into pEGFP - C1 . Site - directed muta - genesis was used to change the indicated tyrosine residues into alanines . The constructs were overexpressed in HEK293 cells using polyethylenei - mine ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . 48 h after transfection , cells were lysed in 1 ml of 50 - mM Tris - HCL , pH 7 . 8 , with 0 . 5 % vol / vol NP - 40 and protease inhibitor cocktail . The cytoplasmic tails were then precipitated with GFP - Trap beads ( Chromotek ) for 30 min followed by Western blot analysis of endogenous SNX17 in the precipitates . Full - length Itg  1 - GFP was retrovirally expressed in Itg  1  /  MEFs and precipitated from extracts of three 15 - cm dishes with GFP - Trap beads in the aforementioned lysis buffer . Lentivirally expressed GFP in Itg  1  /  MEFs served as a control for these precipitations . The pre - cipitates were then analyzed for the presence of endogenous SNX17 . SNX17 domains were cloned into pCherry - C1 ( Takara Bio Inc . ) according to domains listed in the UniProt database . The mCherry - tagged SNX17 constructs were then cotransfected into HEK293 cells with the GFP - tagged integrin cytoplasmic tail constructs and subjected to the same precipitation with anti - RFP beads ( Chromotek ) using the procedure and buffers described were detached from the culture dish with 5 mM EDTA in PBS for 20 min , washed once in PBS with 2 % vol / vol FBS , resuspended in 30 µl of diluted ( 1 : 30 in PBS with 2 % vol / vol FBS ) primary antibody , and incubated for 30 min on ice . The cells were washed once and incubated with anti – mouse Alexa Fluor 488 secondary antibody ( 1 : 50 in PBS with 10 % vol / vol FBS ) for 20 min . The cells were washed again and resuspended in PBS containing 2 % vol / vol FBS and 1 % wt / vol PFA . The fluorescence intensity of 20 , 000 cells for each sample was then analyzed on a flow cytometer ( FACSCanto II ; BD ) . A monoclonal antibody against GFP ( Roche ) served as an isotype control . Focal adhesion formation 13 - mm coverslips were coated with 10 µg / ml fibronectin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) and blocked with 10 mg / ml BSA . Fibroblasts were plated at a density of 1 . 25 × 10 4 cells per coverslip and allowed to spread at 37°C for 10 – 90 min be - fore fixing with 4 % ( wt / vol ) PFA . Fixed cells were permeabilized with 0 . 5 % ( wt / vol ) Triton X - 100 diluted in PBS and blocked with 3 % ( wt / vol ) BSA in PBS before staining for vinculin ( hVin - 1 ; Sigma - Aldrich ) and actin ( TRITC - phalloidin ; Sigma - Aldrich ) . Focal adhesion area was analyzed by measuring pixel area above an empirically determined threshold of fluorescence intensity using ImageJ software . Quantitative Western blotting For the quantification of total integrin and SNX17 levels , the HeLa cells were lysed in PBS with 1 % vol / vol Triton X - 100 and protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche ) . The protein content of the samples was determined with Bradford reagent ( Bio - Rad Laboratories ) , and equal amounts were resolved on precast SDS - PAGE gels ( NuSep 4 – 20 % ) and blotted onto polyvinyli - dene fluoride membranes ( Immobilon - FL ; Millipore ) followed by detection of Itg  5  1 , SNX17 , and  - actin levels on the Odyssey system . SNX17 and integrin signal intensity was normalized by the  - actin signal and calcu - lated as a percentage of control for each oligo . Integrin internalization / recycling assay and endosomal marker analysis Biotinylation - based internalization and recycling assays were performed as previously described in Dozynkiewicz et al . ( 2012 ) ( recycling ) with Western blot detection of integrins instead of an ELISA assay . In brief , cells were transfected with control and SNX17 siRNA in 12 - well plates , split into 6 - well plates 14 h after transfection , and incubated for another 48 h . The cells were serum starved for 1 h and washed in ice - cold PBS , and surface proteins were biotinylated with 0 . 2 mg / ml Sulfo - NHS - SS Biotin ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) in cold PBS followed by washing in TBS and placing on ice . The cells were then incubated in prewarmed DME with 10 % FBS at 37°C for the indicated time points , whereas control cells remained on ice . Surface biotin was then stripped from the cells with 2 × 10 – min incubation in 50 mM MesNa ( Sigma - Aldrich ) in TBS , pH 8 . 6 , followed by washing and quenching of the MesNa with 20 mM iodoacetamide ( Sigma - Aldrich ) in TBS for 10 min . The control cells were not subjected to surface reduction to obtain total surface - labeled integrin . After quenching , the cells were lysed in PBS with 1 % Triton X - 100 including protease inhibitors . Protein concentration of the lysates was determined with the Bradford reagent , and biotinylated proteins were precipitated from equal amounts of total protein with Streptavidin Sepharose ( GE Healthcare ) . After washing , pro - teins were eluted from the beads by boiling in SDS sample buffer containing 2 . 5 %  - mercaptoethanol followed by quantitative Western blot analysis of Itg  5  1 . The percentage of internalized integrin was calculated from the signal intensity of MesNa - resistant ( internalized ) Itg  5 relative to total Itg  5 for each time point in four independent experiments . For the recycling assay , the same labeling procedure as for the inter - nalization assay was used . Surface - labeled integrins were then allowed to be internalized for 30 min in DME with 10 % FBS at 37°C followed by a first stripping of surface label in the buffers described for the internalization assay . The cells were then washed and returned to 37°C in DME with 10 % FBS for the indicated time points to chase internalized integrins back to the cell surface . The cells were then subjected to a second round of surface reduction to remove the biotin from recycled integrins . Cell lysis , capture of biotinylated proteins , and detection were performed as described for the internalization assay . Recycling of Itg  5  1 was calculated from the signal intensity of Itg  5 remaining in the cells after 15 and 30 min rela - tive to the control cells ( t0 ) that had not been brought back to 37°C after surface reduction . For the antibody - based recycling assay , control and SNX17 - transfected HeLa cells were incubated with 5 µg / ml antibody against active ( TS2 / 16 ) and inactive ( P5D2 ) antibody in DME with 10 % FBS for 1 h at 37°C . The cells were then washed in ice - cold PBS , and surface - bound antibody was stripped from the cells with cold PBS , pH 2 . 5 , for 2 × 1 min . After the acid rinse , cells were washed once in PBS and returned to prewarmed on J u l y 10 , 2017 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m 229 SNX17 prevents degradation of integrins • Steinberg et al .

Low density lipoprotein receptor­related protein­1 promotes beta1 for the GFP - Trap precipitations . For the in vitro translation , the mCherry - tagged FERM domain was subcloned into pCDNA3 . 1 to allow expression from the T7 promoter . The constructs were then in vitro translated with the coupled transcription / translation kit ( T n T ; Promega ) according to the man - ufacturer’s instructions . The translation mixes with the mCherry - tagged FERM domain were then mixed with equal volumes of the mixes with the GFP - tagged Itg  1 tails , incubated for 10 min , diluted with 50 mM Tris , pH 7 . 8 , and precipitated with GFP - Trap beads for 30 min . For the analysis of WASH complex association , GFP - tagged SNX17 and SNX27 were overexpressed in HEK293 cells , which were lysed in the aforementioned lysis buffer followed by GFP - Trap precipitation and analysis of endogenous WASH1 , Strumpellin , and FAM21 antibody in the precipitates . Image acquisition details The fluorophores used in the study were anti – mouse amino - methyl - coumarin - acetate ( Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories , Inc . ) , anti – rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 ( Invitrogen ) , anti – mouse Alexa Fluor 594 ( Invitrogen ) , and anti – goat Alexa Fluor 594 ( Invitrogen ) . All samples were mounted in Mowiol mounting medium and imaged at room temperature . Microscopy images were taken on a confocal laser - scanning microscope ( SP5 AOBS ) attached to an inverted epifluorescence microscope ( DMI6000 ) . Camera and acqui - sition software used were the standard SP5 system software and camera . The objective used was a 63× , NA 1 . 4 , oil immersion objective ( Plan Apochromat BL ) . All images were subjected to removal of noise with Voloc - ity using the standard remove noise function . For some images , brightness and contrast were increased uniformly over all images of the respective assay using Photoshop . Online supplemental material Fig .
