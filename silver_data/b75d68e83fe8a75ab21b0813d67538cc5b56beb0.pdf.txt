Here , we identify a number of novel SYNJ2 binding partners , several of which have previously been shown to be necessary for invadopodia formation or clathrin - mediated endocytosis . We focus on Src family kinases . We found that Src phosphorylates SYNJ2 on Tyr 490 , thereby stimulating SYNJ2 5 ’ - phosphatase activity in vitro . We also provide evidence that Src - mediated phosphorylation of SYNJ2 contributes to invadopodia formation . Introduction Synaptojanin ( SYNJ ) phosphatidylinositol ( PI ) phosphatases contain two distinct phosphatase domains , a Sac1 homology domain that acts on PI ( 3 ) P , PI ( 4 ) P and PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 and an inositol 5 ' - phosphatase domain that acts on PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 . 1 There are two synaptojanins in the human genome . The major splice isoform of SYNJ1 is brain - specific , 2 whereas SYNJ2 is expressed in a wide range of tissues . 3 The C - terminal domains of SYNJ 1 and 2 diverge in sequence . However , both contain proline - rich domains ( PRDs ) that mediate binding to SH3 domain - containing proteins . The C - terminal domain of SYNJ2 , but not SYNJ1 , also contains a Rac1 - binding domain . 4 SYNJ1 and 2 play diverse roles in clathrin - mediated endocy - tosis . The primary role of SYNJ1 appears to be the uncoating of clathrin - coated vesicles , 5 although it also contributes to vesicle internalization . 6 , 7 In contrast , synaptojanin 2 plays a critical role at an early step of clathrin - mediated endocytosis , 8 although it is possible that SYNJ2 also functions in vesicle decoating . We also have shown that SYNJ2 is necessary for the invasive behavior of a number of different tumor cell types . 9 The role of SYNJ2 in tumor cell invasion is independent from its role in clathrin - mediated endocytosis and is likely to be mediated by its function in the formation of invadopodia . 9 SYNJ2 also is strongly enriched in invadopodia . 9 Tumor cell invadopodia are specialized membrane structures at which extracellular matrix degradation is concentrated . 10 - 12 We note that invadopodia are similar in composition and structure to podosomes . 10 The term podosome is usually reserved for such structures found in normal cells and in Src - transformed fibroblasts , whereas the term invadopodium is restricted to cancer cells . How SYNJ2 regulates invadopodia formation remains to be elucidated . A number of proteins that are regulated by PI metabolism play key roles in invadopodia . These include Tks5 and cortactin . 13 , 14 Thus , likely functions of SYNJ2 in invadopodia include regulating the localization and / or activity of these proteins . SYNJ2 binds to a number of SH3 domain - containing proteins , including endophilin , amphiphysin and CIN85 , all of which play key roles in the regulation of clathrin - mediated endocytosis . 15 - 18 In this paper , we identify a number of novel SYNJ2 binding partners , several of which have been shown to be necessary for invadopodia formation . We focus on Src family kinases , as Src is a central regulator of invadopodia formation . 10 , 12 Results In order to identify novel SYNJ2 binding partners , we screened a library of purified SH3 domains immobilized on a membrane ( TranSignal SH3 Domain Arrays , Panomics ) using a His - tagged C - terminal domain of SYNJ2 that contains all five PRDs ( Fig . 1 ) . The list of positives ( Table 1 ) included two SH3 domain - containing protein that are known to interact with both SYNJ2 and SYNJ1 , endophilin and Grb2 , and several that previously have been shown to bind to SYNJ1 , intersectin , Nck1 and * Correspondence to : Marc Symons : Email : msymons @ nshs . edu Submitted : 04 / 27 / 12 ; Revised : 08 / 15 / 12 ; Accepted : 09 / 10 / 12 http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 4161 / cam . 22139 Cell Adhesion & Migration 6 : 6 , 518 – 525 ; November / December 2012 ; G 2012 Landes Bioscience 518 Cell Adhesion & Migration Volume 6 Issue 6 SNX9 . 15 , 19 - 22 Remarkably , five members of the Src family of kinases ( SFK ) were among the positives , Fyn , Hck , Lck , Lyn and Src . Src is known to be a key regulator of invadopodia . 10 , 12 Cortactin , another protein that is necessary for invadopodia formation 14 also was among the positives . To confirm the interaction of SYNJ2 with Src family kinases in a cellular setting , we performed co - expression of full length SYNJ2 together with full length Lyn or Fyn in HEK293 cells . Immunoprecipitation of Lyn or Fyn from lysates of co - expressing cells , but not from cells in which SYNJ2 was overexpressed on its own , showed specific interaction between SYNJ2 and these kinases ( Fig . 2A and B ) . We obtained similar results for the interaction of SYNJ2 with intersectin ( Fig . 2C ) . We also confirmed the interaction between SYNJ2 and cortactin , using two different approaches . First , endogenous cortactin could be precipitated from SNB19 glioblastoma cell lysates with an immobilized SYNJ2 C - terminal domain GST - fusion protein , but not GST itself ( Fig . 2D ) . Second , SYNJ2 co - immunopreci - pitated with cortactin from HEK293 cells co - expressing full length versions of both SYNJ2 and cortactin ( Fig . 2E ) . We also identified intersectin and cortactin using mass spectrometry , as endogenous proteins associated with SYNJ2 that was over - expressed in HEK293 cells ( data not shown ) . The interaction of SYNJ2 with Src family kinases suggested to us that Src may be phosphorylating SYNJ2 and thereby modulating its activity . To examine whether Src phosphorylates SYNJ2 , we co - expressed full length SYNJ2 together with constitutively active Src in 293T cells , immunoprecipitated SYNJ2 with an anti - Myc antibody and determined tyrosine phosphorylation of SYNJ2 using an anti - phospho - tyrosine antibody . We observed robust Src - stimulated phosphorylation of SYNJ2 in these conditions ( Fig . 3A ) . We confirmed these findings by examining tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous SYNJ2 by immunoprecipitating SYNJ2 from Src - transformed or control SNB19 glioblastoma cells ( Fig . 3B ) . To identify SYNJ2 tyrosine residues that are phosphorylated by Src , we performed an in vitro phosphorylation assay using Myc - tagged SYNJ2 purified from 293T cells and recombinant His - tagged Src purified from Sf21 insect cells . Phosphorylated SYNJ2 peptides resulting from a trypsin digest were analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry coupled to liquid chromatography ( LC - MS / MS ) . The only tyrosine - phosphorylated residue detected was Tyr 490 ( Fig . 4A ) located between the Sac1 and 5 ' - phosphatase domains . To confirm that Tyr 490 is indeed a substrate for Src phosphorylation , we mutated this residue to Ala using site - directed mutagenesis . We observed that the Src - stimulated in vitro tyrosine phosphorylation of the Y490A mutant was strongly inhibited in comparison to that of wild - type SYNJ2 ( Fig . 4B and C ) . To examine the functional consequences of Src - mediated phosphorylation of SYNJ2 , we determined whether Src stimulates Figure1 . Chemoluminescence detection of SYNJ2 - interacting SH3 domains . TransSignal SH3 Domain Array membranes were incubated with a His - tagged C - terminal domain of SYNJ2 ( GST - SYNJ2 - C - His ) and developed as described in Materials and Methods .

RESEARCH PAPER www . landesbioscience . com Cell Adhesion & Migration 519 SYNJ2 5 ' - phosphatase activity using a fluorescence polarization - based , competitive assay that quantifies the production of PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 from PtdInd ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 . We found that incubation with Src significantly enhanced SYNJ2 5 ' - phosphatase activity ( Fig . 5 ) . In addition , basal 5 ' - phosphatase activity of SYNJ2 - Y490A was lower than that of wild - type SYNJ2 and Src only marginally stimulated this activity . These results demonstrate that Src - stimulated phosphorylation of Tyr 490 enhances SYNJ2 5 ' - phosphatase activity . To further examine whether Src - mediated phosphorylation of SYNJ2 contributes to the formation of invadopodia , we simultaneously depleted endogenous SYNJ2 from SNB19 cells and reconstituted with wild - type or mutant versions of SYNJ2 . SiRNA - mediated depletion of SYNJ2 was accomplished using a 3 ' UTR - targeting oligo that effectively depletes endogenous SYNJ2 ( by approximately 90 % ) , but does not target the respective reconstituted proteins . We observed that wild - type SYNJ2 largely reversed the inhibitory effect of depleting endogenous SYNJ2 , whereas the Y490A mutant was much less effective ( Fig . 6 ) . In contrast , the 5 ' - phosphatase - deficient mutant was completely ineffective in reconstituting invadopodia formation . Reconstitution by the Sac1 - deficient mutant was not significantly different from that of wild - type SYNJ2 . These results strongly suggest that Src - mediated phosphorylation of Tyr 490 contributes to invadopodia formation by stimulating SYNJ2 5 ' - phosphatase activity . Discussion In this paper , we identify a number of novel binding partners of the SYNJ2 PI phosphatase and focus on Src family kinases . We show that Src phosphorylates SYNJ2 , thereby enhancing its 5 ' - phosphatase activity . We also provide evidence that Src - mediated stimulation of SYNJ2 activity contributes to invadopodia formation . Src is a central regulator of invadopodia and a number of Src substrates have been shown to be essential for invadopodia formation , including cortactin and Tks5 / Fish 10 - 12 Cortactin is an F - actin - binding protein and activates the Arp2 / 3 actin - nucleation complex . 23 Cortactin also is thought to stimulate protease secretion by regulating vesicular trafficking . 24 We note that cortactin also plays a role in clathrin - mediated endocy - tosis . 25 Tks5 is a scaffold protein that contains five SH3 domains and is targeted to invadopodia via its PX domain that binds to PtdIns ( 3 ) P and PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 . 13 Tks5 binds to members of the ADAM family of transmembrane proteases and to proteins involved in the regulation of actin dynamics , including cortactin and N - WASP . 13 , 26 The data presented in Figure2 .

Data shown are representative of at least 2 experiments . 520 Cell Adhesion & Migration Volume 6 Issue 6 this paper add SYNJ2 to the array of Src substrates that control invadopodia formation . Interestingly , kinetic analysis of Src - induced podosome formation in NIH - 3T3 cells has indicated that clustering of PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 is an early and necessary event in podosome formation . 26 In addition , both PI3K and SYNJ2 have been shown to be necessary for the formation of podosomes and invadopo - dia . 26 , 27 Importantly , we also showed that it is the 5 ' - phosphatase , but not Sac1 enzymatic activity of SYNJ2 that regulates invadopodia formation . Thus , these findings , together with our observation that Src stimulates SYNJ2 5 ' - phosphatase activity , strongly suggest that SYNJ2 stimulates invadopodia / podosome formation by producing PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 through hydrolysis of PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 and subsequent recruitment of Tks5 . It is also possible however that SYNJ2 contributes to invadopodia formation by hydrolyzing PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . Indeed , type - I phosphatidylinositol 4 - phosphate 5 - kinase a ( PIP5KI a ) has been shown to be essential for invadopodia formation 28 and a number of proteins that have been implicated in invadopodia formation are regulated by PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , including the actin filament severing protein cofilin and N - WASP , a protein that regulates actin nucleation via Arp2 / 3 . 29 , 30 We also note that both Src and SYNJ2 play critical roles in clathrin - mediated endocytosis . 8 , 31 , 32 Thus , it is likely that Src - stimulated SYNJ2 5 ' - phosphatase activity also contributes to this function . In addition to Src family members and cortactin , we have identified two other potential binding partners of SYNJ2 that have been implicated in the formation of invadopodia and / or podosomes , including Abl2 / Arg and PSTPIP1 . The tyrosine kinase Arg has been shown to function downstream of Src in the functional maturation of invadopodia , at least in part by phosphorylating cortactin and stimulating actin nucleation . 33 PSTPIP1 is an adaptor protein that is primarily expressed in hematopoietic cells and also controls the actin cytoskeleton , in part via its interaction with the protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP - PEST and the actin nucleating protein WASP . 34 Mutations in PSTPIP1 that disrupt binding to PTP - PEST are responsible for pyogenic sterile arthritis , pyoderma gangrenosum and acne ( PAPA ) syndrome , an auto - inflammatory disorder . 34 Recently , PSTPIP1 has been shown to function in podosome formation and macrophage migration . 35 Our screen also identified intersectin and SNX9 , two proteins that have been implicated in the regulation of clathrin - mediated endocytosis , as novel binding partners of SYNJ2 . Intersectin is a multi - domain adaptor protein that is thought to stabilize an endocytic multi - protein complex . 36 , 37 SNX9 is a member of the sorting nexin family and plays multiple roles in clathrin - mediated endocytosis , including regulation of dynamin acitivity and membrane curvature . 38 Whether intersectin and SNX9 also function in the formation of podosomes and invadopodia remains to be established . In conclusion , our findings shed new light on the molecular mechanisms that regulate SYNJ2 . In addition , the identification of a large number of SYNJ2 binding partners strongly suggests that , in addition to regulating PI metabolism , SYNJ2 may function as a scaffold to coordinate signaling events that regulate clathrin mediated endocytosis and the formation of podosomes and invadopodia .

Next , samples were diluted into the kit - provided reaction buffer and subsequently mixed with PIP3 substrate for 30 – 40 min at room temperature . The 5 ' - phosphatase reaction was stopped by heating the sample at 95°C for 3 min . Subsequently , the PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 detector and the fluorescent PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 probe were added and incubated for 30 min .
