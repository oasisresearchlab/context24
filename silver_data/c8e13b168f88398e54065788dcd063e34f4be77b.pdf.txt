During HIV - 1 particle formation , the requisite plasma mem - brane curvature is thought to be solely driven by the retrovi - ral Gag protein . Here , we reveal that the cellular I - BAR pro - tein IRSp53 is required for the progression of HIV - 1 membrane curvature to complete particle assembly . Partial gene editing of IRSp53 induces a decrease in viral particle production and a vi - ral bud arrest at half completion . Single molecule localization microscopy at the cell plasma membrane shows a preferential localization of IRSp53 around HIV - 1 Gag assembly sites . In addition , we observe the presence of IRSp53 in puriﬁed HIV - 1 particles . Finally , HIV - 1 Gag protein localizes preferentially to IRSp53 I - BAR domain induced curved membranes on giant unilamellar vesicles . Overall , our data reveal a strong interplay between IRSp53 I - BAR and Gag at membranes during virus as - sembly . This highlights IRSp53 as a crucial host factor in HIV - 1 membrane curvature and its requirement for full HIV - 1 particle assembly .

Several pathogens , such as bacteria and enveloped viruses interplay with the plasma membrane in the course of their replica - tion cycle . Pathogens often enter the cells by endocytosis ( 1 , 2 ) and exit by membrane vesiculation ( 3 , 4 ) , which are processes linked to generation of plasma membrane curva - ture ; either inward or outward deformations . HIV - 1 is an enveloped positive strand RNA virus belonging to the fam - ily Retroviridae , known to assemble and bud outward from the host cell plasma membrane ( 5 ) . The structural Gag polyprotein of HIV - 1 , by itself , is responsible for particle assembly ( 6 ) : It can oligomerize at the inner leaﬂet of the plasma membrane forming virus - like particles ( VLPs ) . The force required to bend the membrane to achieve VLP forma - tion has been proposed to be provided by Gag self - assembly ( 7 ) . The self - assembly of Gag has also been recently shown to segregate speciﬁc lipids ( 8 , 9 ) and proteins ( 10 ) , gener - ating plasma membrane domains that could favor budding ( 11 , 12 ) . However , only a small proportion of initiated clus - ters of Gag reaches the full assembly state leading to VLP release in living CD4 T cells ( 13 ) , a majority being aborted events . Therefore , the mechanism by which the virus over - comes the energy barrier associated with the formation of the full viral bud remains an open question . Recently , coarse grained model of HIV assembly has shown that self - assembly of Gag might not be sufﬁcient to overcome this energy bar - rier ( 14 ) leaving the assembly in intermediate states support - ing the fact that other factors may be necessary to assist Gag self - assembly during the generation of new VLPs . In - deed , the plasma membrane curvature can be also generated by diverse host cell proteins . For example , I - BAR domain proteins sense and induce negative membrane curvature at a few tens to one hundred of nanometer - scale , i . e . in the HIV - 1 particle diameter size range , while generating outward micrometer - scale membrane protrusions such as membrane rufﬂes , lamellipodia , and ﬁlopodia . IRSp53 was ﬁrst discov - ered as a substrate phosphorylated downstream of the insulin receptor ( 15 ) . It is also the founding member of membrane curving I - BAR domain protein family , whose other mam - malian members are MIM ( missing - in - metastasis ) , ABBA ( actin - bundling protein with BAIAP2 homology ) , PinkBAR ( planar intestinal and kidney speciﬁc BAR domain protein ) , and IRTKS ( insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate ) ( 16 ) . In addition to interactions with plasma membrane , IRSp53 binds both Rac1 through its N - terminal I - BAR domain ( 17 ) and Cdc42 directly through its the unconventional CRIB do - main ( 18 ) , as well as downstream effectors of these GT - Pases such as WAVE2 , Mena , Eps8 or mDia , through the SH3 domain . Thus , IRSp53 functions as a scaffold protein for the Rac1 / Cdc42 cascade ( 19 ) . IRSp53 was reported to exhibit a closed inactive conformation that opens synergisti - cally upon binding to Rac1 / Cdc42 and effector proteins ( 20 – 23 ) . Regulation of IRSp53 activity was recently shown to occur through its phosphorylation and interaction with 14 - 3 - 3 ( 24 ) . Structurally , the I - BAR domain of IRSp53 is composed of crescent - shaped rigid six alpha - helix bundle dimer . Due to its concave membrane binding surface and lipid interac - tions , IRSp53 is able to generate negative membrane curva - ture ( 16 ) . While capable of forming homo - dimers , IRSp53 is also able to recruit and form hetero - dimers with other proteins to form clusters for initiation of membrane curva - ture ( 20 ) . Since the Rac1 / IRSp53 / Wave2 / Arp2 / 3 signaling pathway is involved in the release of HIV - 1 particles ( 25 ) , we hypothesized that IRSp53 may be a prime candidate for Inamdar et al . | bioR χ iv | February 10 , 2021 | 1 – 26 D R A F T membrane remodeling required during viral bud formation . Hence , we investigated the possible role of IRSp53 and its membrane curvature generating activity in HIV - 1 Gag as - sembly and particle budding . Importantly , we discovered that IRSp53 is present in an intracellular complex with HIV - 1 Gag at the cell membrane , incorporated in Gag - VLPs and associ - ated with puriﬁed HIV - 1 particles , and that IRSp53 functions in HIV - 1 assembly as a facilitator of optimal HIV - 1 particle formation through its membrane bending activity . Thus , we identify IRSp53 as an essential non - redundant novel factor in HIV - 1 replication , and demonstrate that it is critical for efﬁ - cient HIV - 1 membrane curvature and full assembly at the cell plasma membrane . Results IRSp53 knockdown decreases HIV - 1 Gag particle re - lease by arresting its assembly at the cell plasma membrane . We report here that partial knockdown of IRSp53 reduces HIV - 1 particle release in host Jurkat T cells and in model cell line HEK293T ( Fig1a , b ) , as we also re - ported previously in primary T lymphocytes ( Thomas et al . , 2015 ) . Cells were treated with siRNA targeting IRSp53 or IRTKS ( validated by extinction of the transfected ectopic IRSp53 - GFP or IRTKS - GFP proteins – Fig S1b and S1c re - spectively ) . In the context of Jurkat T cells , when expressing the viral Gag proteins in the context of HIV - 1 ( ∆ Env ) in order to only monitor the late steps of the viral life cycle , the partial IRSp53 knockdown ( maximum at 50 % of gene extinction ) reduced particle release by 3 fold as compared to the con - trol siRNA ( Fig . 1a , Left ) , and reached 6 fold by calculation if reported to the percentage of gene extinction . This reduction in HIV - 1 particle release is highly signiﬁcant ( n = 3 independent experiments , p value = 0 . 00265 , Student’s t - test ) since the gene editing of IRSp53 cannot be complete , nor edited by CRISPR / Cas9 knockout , without being toxic for the cells , which renders this study particularly delicate timewise . To compare the role of different I - BAR domain proteins from the same family , we also measured the effect of siRNA targeting IRSp53 and IRTKS ( Fig . 1b ) on HIV - 1 Gag virus - like particle ( VLP ) production in HEK293T cells ( see graph Fig . 1b , and immunoblots Fig . S1d , e ) . IRTKS shares similar protein domain organization and high sequence ho - mology with IRSp53 ( 40 % amino acid sequence identity and 59 % sequence similarity , Fig . S2 ) , and displays some func - tional redundancy with IRSp53 ( 26 ) . IRTKS can also in - duce plasma membrane curvature ( 27 ) . Partial knockdown of IRSp53 ( 50 % gene inhibition ) resulted in a 2 - 3 fold decrease in HIV - 1 Gag particle production ( n = 3 independent experi - ments , p value = 0 . 000487 , Student’s t - test ) ( Fig . 1b , Right , Fig . S1d ) . In contrast , knockdown of IRTKS ( Fig . 1b , Fig . S1e ) did not have any signiﬁcant effect on HIV Gag particle release ( n = 3 independent experiments , p value = 0 . 092463 , Student’s t - test ) , thus precluding the possibility of redundant functions between IRSp53 and IRTKS in the context of HIV - 1 Gag particle formation . Electron microscopy imaging of siRNA IRSp53 treated HEK293T cells expressing HIV - 1 Gag revealed particle budding arrests at the cell plasma membrane ( Fig . 1c , Lower Panel ) , as compared to the siRNA - control cells ( Fig . 1c , Upper Panel ) . While the control cells exhib - ited the normal phenotype of Gag - VLP budding from the cell plasma membrane , the IRSp53 knockdown cells displayed a series of viral buds arrested in assembly decorating the cell plasma membrane ( Fig . 1c , Fig S3 ) . These results revealed an arrest in Gag assembly at the membrane and thus the in - volvement of IRSp53 in the assembly process . Since IRSp53 is an I - BAR protein involved in cell membrane curvature , we measured the curvature exhibited by HIV - 1 buds in IRSp53 knockdown cells . While control cells displayed a range of HIV - 1 Gag particles at different stages of assembly and bud - ding , cells knocked down for IRSp53 displayed arrested buds at an early assembly stage ( Fig . 1d ) . On measuring the dimen - sions of these arrested buds , we found that buds from cells knocked down for IRSp53 displayed a narrower range of cur - vature height ( 48 ± 22nm ) as compared to the control ( 85 ± 53 nm ) ( n = 145 buds from 14 different cells , p value = 1 . 0539 x 10 − 28 Kolmogorov - Smirnov Test ) , while the bud widths pre - sented no difference between siIRSp53 ( 135 ± 64nm ) and the control ( 140 ± 87 nm ) ( n = 145 buds from 14 different cells , p value = 0 . 0609 , Kolmogorov - Smirnov Test ) ( Fig . 1e ) . The control cells thus exhibited a range of height and widths con - sistent with the range of buds seen at the membrane of these cells . The result indicates that in the absence of IRSp53 , the viral buds were unable to progress beyond a certain curva - ture . Complexing and increase in membrane binding of IRSp53 upon HIV - 1 Gag expression in cells . Since both Gag and IRSp53 target the cell plasma membrane upon in - teraction with PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( 9 , 10 , 27 – 31 ) , we then tested if Gag and IRSp53 could associate directly or indirectly us - ing immuno - precipitation assays ( Fig . 2 ) . Our results showed that immuno - precipitation of endogenous IRSp53 resulted in co - precipitation of Gag ( Fig . 2a , lane 1 ) as compared to con - trols ( lanes 2 to 4 ) . Unfortunately , we could not access the amount of IRSp53 pull down by the antibody between condi - tions because the IgG signals completely masked endogenous IRSp53 . To overcome this issue , we performed the same ex - periment with ectopic IRSp53 - GFP conﬁrming the pull down of IRSp53 - GFP and Gag by the IRSp53 antibody ( Fig . S4a ) . We concluded that HIV - 1 Gag and IRSp53 were components of the same intracellular complex , interacting directly or in - directly through other factors or membrane domains . IRSp53 is a cellular protein that switches from the cytosol to the cell plasma membrane for inducing membrane rufﬂes upon acti - vation by Rac1 and its effectors ( 22 , 32 ) . We have previously shown that Gag cellular expression trig - gers Rac1 activation ( 25 ) , on which IRSp53 membrane lo - calization and function is dependent . Thus , here , we com - pared the relative membrane binding of IRSp53 upon cellu - lar expression of HIV - 1 Gag using membrane ﬂotation assays ( Fig . 2b ) . In the absence of Gag ( “HEK293T control cells” ) , one could observe the presence of IRSp53 both in the cytosol ( fractions 6 - 8 ) and at the cell membranes ( fractions 1 - 2 ) . The lysosomal membrane protein Lamp2 was used to indicate the membrane fraction . Thus , at equilibrium , 19 ± 8 % of IRSp53 2 | bioR χ iv Inamdar et al . | Full assembly of HIV - 1 particles requires IRSp53 D R A F T Fig . 1 . Partial knockdown of IRSp53 decreases HIV - 1 Gag particle release by arresting assembly at the cell plasma membrane . a ) siRNA knockdown of IRSp53 in Jurkat T lymphocytes leads to a signiﬁcant decrease in pNL4 - 3 ∆ Env particle release ( left graphs , immunoblots for IRSp53 , p = 0 . 00265 , Student’s t - test , and loading controls beneath the graphs ) . Similarly , knockdown of IRSp53 in HEK293T cells led to a signiﬁcant decrease in HIV - 1 Gag particle release ( p = 0 . 00487 , Student’s t - test ) . On the opposite , knockdown of a closely related I - BAR protein IRTKS did not have a signiﬁcant effect on particle release ( p = 0 . 092463 , Student’s t - test , right graphs , immunoblots for IRSp53 , IRTKS and loading controls beneath the graphs ) ( n = 3 independent experiments ) . c ) Transmission electron microscopy images of HEK293T cells expressing HIV - 1 Gag with control siRNA ( upper panel ) and siRNA IRSp53 ( lower panel ) . d ) Cells knocked down for IRSp53 show arrested buds at the plasma membrane as compared to the control cells which display a normal range of buds in different stages of assembly and budding ( scale bar is 100 nm ) . e ) Measurement of the bud dimensions ( height and width median with interquartile ) in the control siRNA and siRNA IRSp53 conditions ( n = 145 buds from 14 different cells for each condition ) . The knocked down cells exhibit a narrow range of heights corresponding to the arrested buds visible in the images while the control cells display a wider range of heights corresponding to assembly progression ( left graph , “Height of bud” ) . Distribution of the height values in the two conditions are signiﬁcantly different ( p = 1 . 05x10 − 28 , Kolmogorov - Smirnov test ) . On the opposite , the widths of the buds in both conditions did not display signiﬁcant differences in distributions . ( p = 0 . 0609 , Kolmogorov - Smirnov test ) .

HIV - 1 Gag and IRSp53 complexing and cell membrane bindings HIV - 1 Gag and IRSp53 complexing and cell membrane bindings . a ) Immunoprecipitation of HIV - 1 Gag with an anti - IRSp53 antibody . HIV - 1 Gag is enriched in anti - IRSp53 pulldown , as compared to the controls . b ) Membrane ﬂotation assay protocol : ( 1 ) 293T cells were dounced , ( 2 ) the post - nuclear supernatant was loaded on a discontinuous sucrose gradient , and ( 3 ) following ultracentrifugation , cell membranes were separated from the cytosolic fraction . c ) Immunoblots of the indicated proteins ( left panel ) and quantiﬁcation of the % of protein membrane binding in the graph ( right panel ) show that upon Gag expression in cells , IRSp53 is signiﬁcantly enriched by 2 - fold in the cell membrane fraction ( p = 0 . 001753 , Student’s t - test ) ( n = 5 independent experiments ) . A similar increase is observed for Tsg - 101 , a known interactor of the Gag - p6 polyprotein ( p = 0 . 001974 ) . was bound to cell membranes ( Fig . 2c ) . The same experi - ment was repeated with cells expressing HIV - 1 Gag , where 66 ± 9 % of Gag was bound to the cell membranes ( Graph , Fig . 2c ) . Notably , we observed a 2 - fold increase with 44 ± 5 % of IRSp53 bound to the cell membrane upon HIV - 1 Gag expression ( Fig . 2c ) ( n = 5 independent experiments , p value = 0 . 001735 , Student’s t - test ) . Interestingly , we observed the same increased membrane binding ( 1 . 5 fold ) of IRSp53 I - BAR in the presence of HIV - 1 Gag on giant unilamellar vesi - cles ( GUVs ) ( Fig . S11 a , b ) . This effect was comparable with the one of Tsg101 , a protein of the ESCRT - I complex known to interact mainly with the p6 domain of Gag ( 33 – 35 ) . The cellular endosomal sorting complex required for transport ( ESCRT ) machinery has been involved into the mechanism of vesicular budding of intracellular multi - vesicular bodies , and also hijacked by the HIV - 1 Gag protein for viral particle budding . Here , we observe a 2 - fold increase in cell mem - brane binding of Tsg101 upon Gag expression , passing from 36 ± 10 % without Gag to 79 ± 8 % in the presence of Gag ( Fig . 2c ) ) ( n = 3 independent experiments , p value = 0 . 001974 , Student’s t - test ) . Furthermore , we examined if Gag / IRSp53 complexing was dependent on the p6 domain of Gag to reveal if this could be independent of ESCRT recruitment by Gag . We thus used a C - terminal mutant of Gag , Gag ∆ p6 , which is deﬁcient in ESCRT - Tsg101 recruitment ( 35 ) , still capable of binding the plasma membrane and assembling particles , but that buds poorly . Thus , Gag ∆ p6 viral particles were teth - ered and stay attached to the plasma membrane ( see ( 13 ) for the characterization of Gag ( i ) mEos2 ∆ p6 ) . Our experiments revealed that Gag , Gag ( i ) mEos2 and Gag ∆ p6 ( i ) mEos2 were all pulled down with IRSp53 ( Fig S4 ) , showing that addition of the internal mEos2 protein did not affect the complexing of Gag with IRSp53 , which tag is required for super reso - lution microscopy imaging of Gag ( see following section ) . Moreover , we showed that the p6 domain was not required for Gag / IRSp53 molecular interplay . Together , these results suggest that there is a complexing between HIV - 1 Gag and IRSp53 reinforcing the idea of a strong molecular interplay between these two proteins directly or indirectly but in the same membrane domain . We evidenced that cellular Gag ex - pression , most probably by triggering Rac1 activation ( 25 ) , favors cell membrane binding of IRSp53 . Single Molecule Localization Microscopy reveals IRSp53 surrounding HIV - 1 Gag assembly sites . Our ﬁnding that IRSp53 and HIV - 1 Gag are present in the same molecular complex at the cell membrane motivated us to assess whether IRSp53 was present speciﬁcally at the Gag assembly sites . Because HIV - 1 assembly are ∼ 100 nm in diameter ( 13 , 36 ) , we used PALM ( Photo - Activated Local - ization Microscopy ) coupled to dSTORM ( direct Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy ) with TIRF illumination , to investigate with high resolution the localization of I - BAR proteins in Gag ( i ) mEos2 assembly sites at the plasma mem - brane . Using density based spatial scan ( DBSCAN ) of Gag 4 | bioR χ iv Inamdar et al . | Full assembly of HIV - 1 particles requires IRSp53 D R A F T localizations , we quantiﬁed the size distribution of the Gag clusters , at a localization precision of ∼ 16 nm ( Fig S5 ) , and we found a diameter of 80 to 100 nm , which is within the size - range of HIV - 1 Gag assembly sites ( 13 , 36 ) ( Fig . 3a , b ) . Reconstructed dual color PALM / STORM images exhibited Gag ( i ) mEos2 assembly sites close to or overlapping IRSp53 ( Fig . 3a , Fig . S6 ) whereas Gag clusters did not seem to overlap with IRTKS ( Fig . 3b , Fig . S6 ) , consistent with the results of siRNA presented in Fig . 1b . In order to quantify these obser - vations , we performed coordinate - based colocalization ( 37 ) ( CBC ) analysis of HIV - 1 Gag and IRSp53 ( or IRTKS ) ( Fig . S7 for the process workﬂow ) . In contrast to classical colo - calization analysis , CBC takes into account the spatial distri - bution of biomolecules to avoid excessive colocalization due to local densities and provides a colocalization value for each single - molecule localization . This CBC value ranges from - 1 to + 1 , where - 1 corresponds to anti - correlation , 0 indicat - ing non - correlation and + 1 corresponds to perfect correlation between the two molecules . Since CBC values are calcu - lated for each localization , we plotted the CBC values as cu - mulative frequency distributions for all localizations ( n > 105 ) of IRSp53 / Gag and IRTKS / Gag . As shown in Fig . 3c , the CBC distribution for IRSp53 / Gag has a higher proportion of values exhibiting high colocalization ( 27 % of CBC > 0 . 5 ) in comparison with IRTKS / Gag values ( 14 % of CBC > 0 . 5 ) which on the opposite show a very high proportion ( close to 75 % ) of anti - correlation ( CBC < 0 ) ( Fig . 3d ) . This com - parison directly shows that IRSp53 displays stronger single molecule colocalization with Gag in assembling clusters than IRTKS does . However , the average positions of IRTKS or IRSp53 molecules with respect to Gag molecules within the assembling clusters were unclear . Thus , we performed simu - lations to generate different patterns of PALM / STORM lo - calizations ( Fig . S8 ) . Comparison of the CBC values of simulated data with our experimental values indicated that IRSp53 localization , on average , displays a restricted pat - tern around and in the assembly sites . This corresponds to a circular ring surrounding the assembly site at 80 nm from the center of the Gag budding sites with a width of 80 nm ( Fig . 3e , Fig . S8e ) . On the other hand , IRTKS was present as a large diffuse pattern centered at 140 nm from the Gag assembly site center with a width of 200 nm , explaining why fewer IRTKS molecules were detected in the assembly sites ( Fig . 3f , Fig . S8f ) . Our results thus show that IRSp53 indeed speciﬁcally localizes at HIV - 1 Gag assembly sites at the cell plasma membrane , whereas IRTKS poorly does . Finally , the same imaging ( Fig . S9 ) and CBC analyses ( Fig . S10 ) were applied to the HIV - 1 host CD4 T cells , i . e . Jurkat T cells ex - pressing Gag ( i ) mEos2 and immuno - labelled for IRSp53 ( Fig S10a ) or for IRTKS ( Fig S10b ) . The results showed that the CBC cumulative distributions for IRSp53 ( Fig S10c , e ) , as well as for IRTKS ( Fig S10d , f ) , are similar to those ob - tained in HEK293T cells ( Fig . 3c , d ) . These analyses con - ﬁrm the preferred IRSp53 localization to Gag assembly site in the host CD4 T cells . The involvement of IRSp53 around Gag assembly sites seems to be conserved regardless of the cell type , reinforcing the idea of a speciﬁc role for IRSp53 in HIV - 1 Gag particle assembly . IRSp53 is incorporated in HIV - 1 particles . To assess IRSp53 incorporation into HIV - 1 Gag particles , we puriﬁed Gag virus - like particles ( VLP ) from cells transfected with Gag - mCherry and several GFP - tagged I - BAR domain pro - teins ( Fig . 4a ) . IRTKS displays functional redundancy with IRSp53 ( Chou et al . , 2017 ; Millard et al . , 2007 ) , being able to curve membranes . IRSp53 - I - BAR - GFP construct only contains the membrane curving I - BAR domain of IRSp53 . PH - PLC δ - GFP , a PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding protein , was used as a control , because it binds PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 but does not gener - ate membrane curvature . Fluorescent VLPs puriﬁed from these transfected cells were then visualized for two colors ( green : GFP and red : mCherry ) , and Mander’s coefﬁcient was calculated as an indicator of incorporation of the ectopic ( green ) GFP - tagged proteins within the ( red ) Gag - mCherry VLPs ( see Materials and methods ) ( Fig . 4a ) . We found that correlation for IRSp53 - GFP and Gag - mCherry was 0 . 95 - 1 ( Fig . 3b , Left Graph , Red Column ) , indicating that almost all Gag - mCherry VLPs contained IRSp53 - GFP . When using the IRSp53 - I - BAR domain alone , we also obtained a high Mander’s coefﬁcient , ∼ 0 . 8 ( Fig . 4b ) . In contrast , for IRTKS - GFP , the Mander’s coefﬁcient was 0 . 4 - 0 . 5 , indicating no sig - niﬁcant correlation between IRTKS - GFP and Gag - mCherry . Taken together , these results show the preferential incorpo - ration of IRSp53 - GFP , or its I - BAR - GFP domain , into re - leased HIV - 1 Gag particles . To study the incorporation of endogenous IRSp53 in HIV - 1 particles , cells were transfected with plasmids expressing either wild - type infectious HIV - 1 or codon optimized immature HIV - 1 Gag protein ( without genomic RNA ) . The virus particles were puriﬁed through a 20 % - sucrose cushion or further through continuous iodixanol density gradient ( as in ( 39 , 40 ) ) . IRSp53 was found to be as - sociated with the viral particles in both conditions , i . e . in infectious HIV - 1 and in Gag VLPs , indicating that Gag alone is sufﬁcient to recruit IRSp53 in the viral particles ( Fig . 4c , d , “IRSp53” ) . Tsg101 also showed an association with viral particles in both conditions ( Fig . 4c , d , “Tsg101” ) , as reported previously ( 33 , 34 , 38 ) . In contrast , IRTKS was not associ - ated neither with Gag - VLP nor HIV - 1 particles ( Fig 4c , d , “IRTKS” ) . Upon further puriﬁcation ( Fig . 4e ) , IRSp53 , and the ESCRT proteins , Tsg101 and ALIX , were found asso - ciated within the same fractions containing the HIV - 1 Gag viral particles , together with other well - known viral particle cofactors such as CD81 , CD63 tetraspanins ( 39 , 40 ) . Thus , endogenous IRSp53 is most probably incorporated in HIV - 1 particles in a Gag dependent manner . HIV - 1 Gag is enriched at membrane tube tips gener - ated by IRSp53 I - BAR domain . The results above demon - strate that not only IRSp53 is incorporated in Gag - VLPs , but it is present at the budding sites and its deletion strongly re - duces HIV - 1 particle release in a Gag - dependent manner by arresting its assembly at the cell plasma membrane ( Fig . 1 ) . In order to advance molecular mechanistic understanding of the role of IRSp53 locally at Gag assembly sites , we assessed IRSp53 I - BAR / Gag interplay on model membranes , using Inamdar et al . | Full assembly of HIV - 1 particles requires IRSp53 bioR χ iv | 5 D R A F T Fig . 3 .

( See Fig S5 for details ) . IRSp53 shows an experimental cumulative CBC distribution corresponding to a belt of 80nm width ( waist = 40nm ) centered at a distance of 80 nm from the center of Gag assembly sites ( left graph , bold grey line corresponds to experimental data for IRSp53 , bold blue line corresponds to simulated values closest to experimental data ) .

The other I - BAR domain proteins were not signiﬁcantly correlated with Gag - mCherry particles ( 0 . 4 - 0 . 5 ) . PH - PLC δ - GFP , a known marker of the phospholipid PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , shows a slightly higher correlation ( 0 . 6 ) , since HIV - 1 Gag is known to associate with this phospholipid . c ) Incorporation of IRSp53 into wild type pNL4 - 3 HIV - 1 or d ) Gag VLPs revealed by immunoblots against Gag ( p24 ) , IRSp53 , IRTKS , Tsg101 or actin , as indicated . Following a 25 % sucrose cushion puriﬁcation , IRSp53 was found to be associated with released wild type HIV - 1 ( left panel ) and Gag VLPs ( right panel ) . Tsg101 , known to be incorporated into released particles , was also found associated with viral particles .

Inamdar et al . | Full assembly of HIV - 1 particles requires IRSp53 bioR χ iv | 7 D R A F T GUVs . For Gag membrane binding assay , we ﬁrst used a high concentration of IRSp53 I - BAR domain ( 0 . 5µM ) while keeping PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 concentration constant , in order to prevent having tubes generated by IRSp53 I - BAR ( 41 ) and to focus on analyzing Gag - ﬂat GUV membrane binding efﬁciency in the presence of IRSp53 I - BAR . We found that Gag bind - ing to GUV membranes is increased 7 fold when IRSp53 - I - BAR domain was introduced ﬁrst on GUVs before adding Gag ( median value 6 . 7 ) , compared to the condition of Gag only ( median value 0 . 9 ) ( p < 0 . 0001 , Student’s t - test ) ( Fig . 5a , “Gag only” vs . “I - BAR + Gag” ) . However , in the condition where Gag was introduced before adding the I - BAR domain , Gag intensity on GUV membranes increased only 3 fold as compared to the Gag only condition ( p < 0 . 0001 , Student’s t - test ) ( Fig . 5a , “Gag only” vs . “Gag + I - BAR” ) . Notably , by comparing I - BAR + Gag and Gag + I - BAR conditions , we ob - served a 2 - fold higher Gag intensity on GUV membranes in the ﬁrst condition ( p < 0 . 0001 , Student’s t - test ) ( Fig . 5a , “I - BAR + Gag” vs . “Gag + I - BAR” ) . Taken together , these results show that IRSp53 I - BAR facilitates Gag membrane binding on GUV in favor of increasing Gag concentration lo - cally . Given these results , and that IRSp53 is a membrane curving protein involved in the early stage of generation of cell protrusions ( 20 , 42 ) , we asked whether the local mem - brane deformation induced by IRSp53 could be a preferred location for HIV - 1 Gag assembly . Previous in vitro stud - ies showed that when placing IRSp53 I - BAR domain outside PIP2 - containing GUVs , even at a relatively low bulk con - centration ( about 0 . 02 - 0 . 06 µM ) , I - BAR domain can de - form GUV membranes , generating tubes towards the inte - rior of the vesicles ( 27 , 30 , 43 ) . We thus incubated GUVs with I - BAR domain at low concentration ( 0 . 05µM ) , which allows for the generation of inward membrane tubes , fol - lowed by the addition of Gag ( Fig5b , see Materials and Meth - ods ) . This experiment revealed that Gag was sorted preferen - tially to the tips of the tubes generated by the I - BAR domain ( Fig . 5b , c , Fig . S11 c , d ) . Furthermore , we observed that addi - tion of HIV - 1 Gag resulted in the formation of shorter I - BAR tubules as compared to GUVs incubated with the IRSp53 - I - BAR domain alone ( Fig S11 c , d ) , indicating an interference in I - BAR tubule elongation when Gag sorted to the tubule tips , suggesting that Gag usurps the IRSp53 tubulation func - tion . Together , these results demonstrate that HIV - 1 Gag binding to membranes is enhanced locally by the presence of IRSp53 I - BAR domain , and that Gag preferentially binds to highly curved membranes generated by the I - BAR domain of IRSp53 . Discussion The ﬁndings of this study uncovered the role of the host cellu - lar I - BAR factor IRSp53 in HIV - 1 Gag assembly and mem - brane curvature upon bud formation . In vitro , we showed that the IRSp53 I - BAR domain enhances Gag membrane binding locally ( Fig5 ) . Independently , we also checked if siRNA mediated knockdown of IRSp53 was changing to - tal membrane binding of Gag using membrane ﬂotation as - says , but we did not observe any signiﬁcant changes ( not shown ) , emphasizing the local role of IRSp53 at Gag as - sembly sites rather than at the global cellular level . Indeed , IRSp53 was found at , or in the close vicinity of , Gag as - sembly platforms at the cell membrane ( Fig . 3 ) , and is in - corporated into Gag virus - like particles and in HIV - 1 virions ( Fig . 4 ) . Importantly , we revealed that IRSp53 partial knock - down arrests Gag assembly at the mid - bud formation stage ( Fig . 1 ) and that Gag preferentially locates at the tube tips in - duced by IRSp53 I - BAR domain , interfering with its long tubule formation in vitro ( Fig . 5 ) . Altogether , IRSp53 ap - pears instrumental in membrane curvature upon HIV - 1 bud - ding and is locally subverted as an essential factor needed for full HIV - 1 Gag particle assembly . Using GUVs , we ob - served that Gag not only colocalizes with the IRSp53 I - BAR domain on the vesicles , but that the IRSp53 - I - BAR domain increases Gag binding to these model membranes , mimick - ing the possible local Gag / IRSp53 interplay at the assembly site ( Fig5a ) . Indeed , BAR domain proteins , in general , and IRSp53 , in particular , are known to induce strong PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 clusters ( 27 , 44 ) , and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 was shown to play a role in Gag binding to cell plasma membrane ( 45 ) , as well as to be strongly clustered during virus assembly ( 9 , 28 , 45 ) . Thus , these results suggest that membrane binding of Gag on IRSp53 - enriched membrane domains could promote the plasma membrane binding of both proteins ( Fig . 3 , S6 ) . This is in agreement with super resolution imaging in the cell , where Gag / IRSp53 interactions may take place at the Gag assembly sites , since , here , IRSp53 was localized in close proximity to Gag assembly sites in HEK293T cells ( Fig . 3 ) and in host CD4 T cells ( Fig S9 , S10 ) . Our experiments suggest that Gag and IRSp53 are associated in a common complex at the cell plasma membrane ( Fig2 ) . The fact that upon Gag expression IRSp53 increases to the cell membrane ( Fig . 2b , c ) , suggests that Gag could activate IRSp53 , through Rac1 activation ( 25 ) , perhaps by releasing its auto - inhibition ( 24 ) . This remains to be tested . HIV - 1 particles are known to incorporate a large number of cellular proteins , many of which are directly involved in virus budding ( 38 ) . Here , we showed that IRSp53 is incorporated in Gag - VLPs , as well as in puriﬁed HIV - 1 virions ( Fig . 4 ) , which most likely depends on the I - BAR domain of IRSp53 ( Fig . 4 ) . Using the IRSp53 - I - BAR domain on GUVs , we induced membrane protrusions that have a negative mean curvature similar to a viral bud ; Gag was found enriched in these tubular structures but partic - ularly at the tips that have a half - sphere geometry similar to a viral bud ( Fig . 5 ) . This indicates that Gag binds preferentially to IRSp53 I - BAR - curved membranes in vitro in contrast to other almost - ﬂat areas of the GUVs . Similarly , in cells , sin - gle molecule localisation images reveal some Gag clusters enriched at IRSp53 labelled protrusions at the plasma mem - brane ( Fig S6a ) . IRSp53 clusters have already been reported prior to ﬁlopodia formation ( 20 ) and in negatively curved area at the onset of endocytic buds ( 42 ) . Moreover , it was shown that inducing local membrane curvature helps to initi - ate Gag lattice formation ( 14 ) . We thus propose that IRSp53 induces local membrane curvature , upon activation through Rac1 / Cdc42 and effectors , which promotes local Gag recruit - 8 | bioR χ iv Inamdar et al . | Full assembly of HIV - 1 particles requires IRSp53 D R A F T Fig . 5 .

Inamdar et al . | Full assembly of HIV - 1 particles requires IRSp53 bioR χ iv | 9 D R A F T ment and initiation of the viral assembly ( knowing that ex - pression of Gag can activate Rac1 ( 25 ) ) . Although the pres - ence of RNA can facilitate the growth of the Gag network ( 46 ) , favouring membrane bending due to the intrinsic curva - ture of assembling Gag hexamers , coarse grained simulations of HIV - 1 Gag assembly showed that , above a certain thresh - old , this Gag self - assembly is unable to overcome the free energy penalty required to curve the membrane . Here , we observed that siRNA knockdown of IRSp53 induces a de - crease in viral particle production and arrests the assembly at half completion ( Fig . 1 ) . Since IRSp53 stabilizes curva - ture by scaffolding ( 30 ) , another role of IRSp53 could be to lower this free energy barrier involved in the progression of the budding process beyond the half - sphere geometry , by sta - bilizing long enough the bud curvature . This , either directly by organizing linearly around the assembly site ( 43 ) and me - chanically constricting the nascent bud , or indirectly with the help of actin polymerization . Interestingly , Ku et al . , also observed that 60 % of assembling particles exhibit a pause around the midway mark of the assembly process ( 47 ) . This pause can provide a temporal window for IRSp53 to inter - vene in the progression of HIV - 1 particle assembly as we pro - pose here . Finally , ESCRT recruitment occurs at the end of virus assembly , after the membrane has been curved , forming a vesicle ready to bud ( 48 , 49 ) . Overexpression of a mutant of the ESCRT protein Tsg101 was previously shown to block HIV - 1 budding at a late stage , arresting the budding with a characteristic bulb shaped phenotype indicative of a defect in the late stage of the bud scission ( 50 ) , in contrast with our observations with the IRSp53 siRNA phenotype ( Fig . 1 , Fig . S3 ) . Consequently , this suggests that Gag - IRSp53 asso - ciation is ESCRT independent ( as shown in Fig . S4 ) and oc - curs at an earlier stage of virus assembly . Another study ( 51 ) showed that angiomotin , which acts as an adaptor protein for HIV - 1 Gag and the ubiquitin ligase NEDD4L , functions in HIV - 1 assembly prior to ESCRT - I recruitment . Interestingly , angiomotin also contains a BAR domain ( 52 ) , but it is canon - ically involved in inducing positive curvature , as opposed to the negative curvature induced by I - BAR IRSp53 . Thus , it is possible that angiomotin functions in another way , for exam - ple , at the viral bud neck which has both positive and negative curvatures by facilitating ESCRT recruitment . IRSp53 itself is a scaffold protein for cofactors of cortical actin signalling ( 16 ) and we have previously shown that a Rac1 signalling pathway , including IRSp53 , is involved in HIV - 1 particle pro - duction ( 25 ) . Thus , it is possible that IRSp53 could also play a role in generating local cortical actin density in the vicinity of the viral bud . The role of cortical actin associated with IRSp53 scaffolding in that context remains to be elucidated . Our work illustrates a novel role for the host cellular I - BAR factor IRSp53 , which is subverted by the retroviral Gag pro - tein , in HIV - 1 induced membrane curvature and in favoring the formation of the fully assembled viral particle .

Single - molecule localization mi - croscopy was performed on a Nikon inverted microscope equipped with 405 - , 488 - , 561 - and 642 - nm lasers , an EM - CCD Evolve 512 Photometrics camera ( 512 * 512 , 16µm pixel size ) with an oil immersion objective 100X NA1 . 49 Plan Apochromat . PALM imaging of Gag mEos2 , activation was performed with lasers irradiance set to 0 . 3 kW / cm 2 for 405 nm conversation and ∼ 2 . 2 kW / cm 2 for 561 nm excitation .

Super Resolution Microscopy Analysis . The module DBSCAN of the super resolution quantiﬁcation software SR Tesseler ( 55 ) was used to analyse the PALM localizations for quantiﬁcation of Gag cluster sizes . In order to monitor the localisation of I - BAR proteins in the vicinity of Gag as - sembling particles , a binary mask was introduced into the PALM images . The centre of each Gag assembling clus - ter was determined and a custom MATLAB ( Mathworks ) code was used to extract localizations in a radius of 80nm around each Gag cluster center and to extract IBAR proteins localisations belonging to a disk of 150nm radius around the center of each Gag clusters . These subsets of coordi - nates were then used to calculate coordinate - based colocal - ization ( CBC ) , developed by Malkusch et al . ( 37 ) , and imple - mented in the ThunderSTORM plugin of ImageJ ( Fig . S4 ) . The coordinate - based colocalization ( CBC ) values are calcu - lated from single - molecule localization data of two species ( Gag and IBAR proteins ( IRSp53 or IRTKS ) ) . A CBC value is assigned to each single localization of each species . We analyzed the distributions of these CBC values by plotting and comparing the cumulative frequency distributions of the CBCs obtained in the two conditions ( IRSp53 vs IRTKS ) . Fi - nally , we performed a set of numerical simulations of images in ImageJ ( see Fig . S8 legend for details ) the average local - ization pattern of the immuno - labelled I - BAR proteins with respect to the mEos2 tagged Gag in PALM ( Fig S5 ) .

Images were acquired with Zeiss LSM780 ( for ﬁxed cells ) or Nikon Eclipse Ti - 2 in TIRF mode ( for ﬂuorescent viral particles ) . Colocaliza - tion analysis based on Mander’s coefﬁcients was performed using JaCOP ( Just another Colocalization Plugin ) ( 56 ) .

The M1 and M2 coefﬁcients were calculated for several images and then represented as column graphs with red columns representing the degree of overlap of mCherry images with GFP images , and green columns repre - senting the inverse . Iodixanol gradient . Cell culture medium of HEK293T ( 2 . 5x10 6 cells plated ) transfected with 8µg of pNL4 . 3 ∆ pol ∆ env were collected 48h after transfection and ﬁltered by 0 . 4 mu m ﬁlter . The medium was then ultracen - trifuged on a TNE 20 % sucrose cushion using a SW41Ti ro - tor ( Beckman ) at 40 , 000rpm during 1h30 . A solution with 0 . 25M sucrose , 1mM EDTA , 10mM tris HCL pH 7 , 4 was used to diluted the 60 % iodixanol stock solution ( OptiPrep from Sigma ) and to prepare 40 % and 20 % iodixanol solu - tion . 1 , 5mL of each dilution ( 60 % , 40 % and 20 % iodixanol ) were successively layered in a SW55Ti tube ( Beckman ) and the pellet of VLPs obtained after ultracentrifugation on su - crose cushion was loaded on the top . The tube was ultracen - trifuged at 50 000rpm with a SW55Ti rotor ( Beckman ) dur - ing 3h . Then 20 fractions of 200µl were collected from top of the tube . 20µL or 18 . 75µL of each fraction were loaded for western blotting . GUV reagents . Brain total lipid extract ( 131101P ) and brain L - α - phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PIP2 , 840046P ) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids / Interchim . BODIPY - TR - C5 - ceramide , ( BODIPY TR ceramide , D7540 ) and Alexa Fluor 488 C5 - Maleimide ( AX 488 ) were pur - chased from Invitrogen . β - casein from bovine milk ( > 98 % pure , C6905 ) and other reagents were purchased from Sigma - Aldrich . Culture - Inserts 2 Well for self - insertion were purchased from Ibidi ( Silicon open chambers , 80209 ) . Protein puriﬁcation and ﬂuorescent labelling . Recom - binant mouse IRSp53 I - BAR domain was puriﬁed and la - beled with AX488 dyes as previously described ( Prévost et al . , 2015 ; Saarikangas et al . , 2009 ) . Recombinant HIV - 1 immature Gag protein was puriﬁed by J . Mak as described in ( Yandrapalli et al . , 2016 ) and labelled with Alexa488 maleimide dyes ( Invitrogen ) . Brieﬂy , a 200µM solution of the maleimide dye was incubated overnight at 4°C with a 20µM solution of the Gag puriﬁed protein in a buffer of pH 8 . 0 with 1M NaCl and 50mM Tris . Post incubation , the la - belled mixture was subjected to dialysis with the Slide - A - Lyzer Mini Dialysis Device ( Thermo Scientiﬁc ) , following the manufacturer’s instructions to remove the excess unbound dye from the solution . GUV preparation and observation . Lipid and buffer compositions . Lipid compositions for GUVs were brain total lipid extract ( Yu Seong - hyun et al . , 2006 ) supplemented with 5 mole % brain PIP2 . If needed , 0 . 5 mole % BODIPY TR ceramide was present in the lipid mixture as membrane reporter . The salt buffer inside GUVs , named I - buffer , was 50 mM NaCl , 20 mM sucrose and 20 mM Tris pH 7 . 5 . The salt buffer outside GUVs , named O - buffer , was 60 mM NaCl and 20 mM Tris pH 7 . 5 . GUV preparation . GUVs was prepared by using the polyvinyl alcohol ( PVA ) gel - assisted method ( Weinberger et al . , 2013a ) . Brieﬂy , a PVA solution ( 5 % ( w / w ) of PVA in a 280 mM sucrose solution ) was warmed up to 50°C before spread - ing on a coverslip that was cleaned in advance by being bath 12 | bioR χ iv Inamdar et al . | Full assembly of HIV - 1 particles requires IRSp53 D R A F T sonicated with 2 % Hellmanex for at least 30 min , rinsed with MilliQ water , sonicated with 1M KOH , and ﬁnally sonicated with MilliQ water for 20 min . The PVA - coated coverslip was dried in an oven at 50°C for 30 min . 5 - 10 mu l of the lipid mixture ( 1 mg / mL in chloroform ) was spread on the PVA - coated coverslip , followed by drying under vacuum for 30 min at room temperature . The PVA - lipid - coated coverslip was then placed in a 10 cm cell culture dish and 0 . 5 mL - 1 mL of the inner buffer was added on the coverslip , followed by keeping it stable for 45 min at room temperature to allow GUV to grow . Sample preparation and observation . GUVs were ﬁrst in - cubated with either Gag or I - BAR domain at bulk concen - trations depending on the designed experiments for at least 15 min at room temperature before adding either I - BAR do - main or Gag , respectively , into the GUV - protein mixture . In experiments where there was only Gag but no I - BAR do - main , the stock solution of I - BAR domain was used in or - der to obtain a comparable salt strength outside GUVs as those where I - BAR domain was present . The GUV - protein mixture was then incubated at least 15 min at room temper - ature before observation . For Gag / I - BAR membrane recruit - ment assay , samples were observed by a Nikon C1 confocal microscope equipped with a 60X water immersion objective ( Nikon , CFI Plan Apo IR 60X WI ON 1 . 27 WD 0 . 17 ) . For Gag / I - BAR tubulation assay , samples were observed with an inverted spinning disk confocal microscope Nikon eclipse Ti - E , equipped with Yokogawa CSU - X1 confocal head , 100X CFI Plan Apo VC objective ( Nikon ) and a CMOS camera , Prime 95B ( Photometrics ) . For all experiments , coverslips were passivated with a β - casein solution at a concentration of 5 g . L − 1 for at least 5 min at room temperature . Experi - mental chambers were assembled by placing a silicon open chamber on a coverslip . GUV Image analysis . Image analysis was performed by us - ing Fiji ( 57 ) . Quantiﬁcation of AX488 Gag binding on GUV membranes . Fluorescence images were taken at the equatorial planes of GUVs using identical confocal microscopy settings . The background intensity of the AX488 channel was obtained by manually drawing a line with a width of 10 pixels perpendic - ularly across the membrane of a GUV . We then obtained the background intensity proﬁle of the line where the x - axis of the proﬁle is the length of the line and the y - axis is the av - eraged pixel intensity along the width of the line . The back - ground intensity was obtained by calculating the mean value of the sum of the ﬁrst 10 intensity values and the last 10 in - tensity values of the background intensity proﬁle . To obtain Gag ﬂuorescence intensity on the membrane of the GUV , we used membrane ﬂuorescence signals to ﬁnd the contour of the GUV . Then , a 10 pixel wide band centred on the contour of the GUV was used to obtain the Gag intensity proﬁle of the band where the x - axis of the proﬁle is the length of the band and the y - axis is the averaged pixel intensity along the width of the band . Gag ﬂuorescence intensity was then obtained by calculating the mean value of the intensity values of the Gag intensity proﬁle , following by subtracting the background in - tensity . Gag sorting map . Fluorescence images of GUVs were taken using identical confocal microscopy settings . For every GUV , we ﬁrst calculated the ﬂuorescence intensity ratio for ev - ery pixel of the Gag and membrane images of a GUV us - ing ( I Gag − ( I Gagbackground ) ) / I membrane , where I Gag is the Gag intensity , I Gagbackground is the background intensity in the Gag channel , and I membrane is the membrane intensity . The sorting map was then obtained by converting the resulting image from the previous step to a pseudo - colored image via the “Look Up Table , Phase” . The background intensity value in the Gag channel was the man intensity value of a 50 pixels wide square in the background outside GUVs . The sorting map of I - BAR domain was obtained by using the same pro - cedure as those for Gag . Statistics . All notched boxes show the median ( central line ) , the 25th and 75th percentiles ( the bottom and top edges of the box ) , the most extreme data points the algorithm considers to be not outliers ( the whiskers ) , and the outliers ( crosses ) .

Effect of siRNA - based IRSp53 and IRTKS knockdown on HIV - 1 Ga particle release . a ) Expression of HIV - 1 Gag in HEK293T cells ( from molecular clones pNL43 ∆ Pol ∆ Env or pGag ( myc ) ) and a schematic representation of the viral Gag structure . Gag is known to have four main domains , the matrix MA interacting with cell membrane , the capsid CA for Gag oligomerization , the nucleocapsid NC interacting with the viral genomic ( + ) RNA and p6 recruiting Tsg101 for particle budding . b ) Validation of siRNA targeting IRSp53 . siRNA targeting IRSp53 diminishes expression of IRSp53 - GFP as seen by immunoblot ( Left , Lane 1 siCTRL , Lane 2 siIRSp53 ) and ﬂuoresence imaging of 293THEK cells expressing IRSp53 - GFP with corresponding siRNA ( right ) . c ) Validation of siRNA targeting IRTKS . siRNA targeting IRTKS diminishes expression of IRTKS - GFP as seen by immunoblot ( Left ) , Left , Lane 1 siCTRL , Lane 3 siIRTKS ) and ﬂuorescence imaging of 293THEK cells expressing IRTKS - GFP with siRNA , as indicated ( right ) . d ) Reduced viral release are seen in cells knocked down for IRSp53 ( representative immunoblots , Lane 1 siCTRL , Lane 2 siIRSp53 ) . e ) IRTKS knockdown has no signiﬁcant effect on HIV - 1 Gag particle release ( representative immunoblots , Lane 1 siCTRL , Lane 3 siIRTKS ) . 16 | bioR χ iv Inamdar et al . | Full assembly of HIV - 1 particles requires IRSp53 D R A F T Fig . S2 . Protein sequence comparison of IRSp53 and IRTKS . a ) IRSp53 and IRTKS are membrane curving I - BAR proteins . b ) IRSp53 ( Query , Accession Q9QB8 ) shares a 40 % sequence homology with IRTKS ( Subject , Accession Q9UHR4 ) Sequence alignment performed with NCBI Protein BLAST . Most of this homology is centered in the I - BAR / IMD domain of the three proteins and the C terminal SRC Homology 3 ( SH3 ) domain common to the two proteins .

SiRNA control ( a ) or siRNA IRSp53 ( b ) treated cells reveal that IRSp53 KD cells display HIV - 1 Gag arrested assembly at the cell plasma membrane as shown by transmission electron microscopy . 18 | bioR χ iv Inamdar et al . | Full assembly of HIV - 1 particles requires IRSp53 D R A F T Fig . S4 . a ) Complexing of IRSp53 - GFP with HIV - 1 Gag . Pulldown of IRSp53 - GFP and IRSp53 - GFP with Gag immuno - precipitated with an IRSp53 antibody ( lane 2 and 4 ) and revealed with anti - CAp24 and anti - IRSp53 antibodies respectively using immunoblots . Mock ( lane 1 ) and Gag ( lane 3 ) are cell lysates from transfected HEK293T cells , used as controls . It is worth noticing that Gag ( lane 3 ) is indeed immuno - precipitated ( without ectopic IRSp53 - GFP ) due to the presence of endogenous IRSp53 . b ) Complexing of IRSp53 with Gag - mEOS2 is independent of Gag - p6 domain . Addition of an internal mEos2 tag within the Gag protein does not affect its complexing with IRSp53 ( Compare lane 1 and Lane 2 ) . Gag - mEos2 ∆ p6 , a mutant of Gag deﬁcient in p6 dependent - ESCRT recruitment , is also immuno - precipitated ( IP ) with IRSp53 antibody ( lane 3 ) , indicating that loss of the p6 domain and Tsg101 recruitment is not a limiting factor for Gag - IRSp53 complexing .

Workﬂow of image analysis for PALM / STORM images . ( 1 ) Reconstructed PALM images ( 2 ) The PALM images were thresholded in ImageJ to obtain a mask of the assembly sites of Gag . ( 3 ) The coordinates of centres of these assembly sites were then obtained using the Analyze Particles feature of ImageJ . ( 4 ) These coordinates were then used to analyze the original PALM and STORM single molecule localizations , and extract PALM coordinates from an area corresponding to size of assembly sites ( r < 80nm from center ) , and STORM coordinates in a larger area around the assembly site ( r < 150nm from center ) . ( 5 ) Using these ﬁlters , a new set of PALM and STORM localizations were generated , which corresponded to Gag assembly sites and the area around these sites . ( 6 ) These localizations were then used to calculate the coordinate based colocalization ( CBC ) for PALM ( Gag ) and STORM ( IRSp53 / IRTKS ) . The CBC values were then plotted as cumulative probability distributions . 22 | bioR χ iv Inamdar et al . | Full assembly of HIV - 1 particles requires IRSp53 D R A F T Fig . S8 . Cumulative frequency distributions of CBCs for simulated PALM / STORM data . Simulations corresponding to different patterns of STORM localizations around PALM clusters were performed using ImageJ . a ) Each molecule position was randomly dis - tributed within a ﬁxed size disk of 100nm diameter for the PALM localizations ( which represent 70 % of all the experimental Gag cluster diameter found ) or within a belt surrounding this disk for the STORM localization . The STORM belt size ranged from a waist of 20 nm ( width 40nm ) to a waist of 100 nm ( width 200nm ) , with distances from center of the simulated viral bud ( PALM disk ) to the center of the surrounding belt ranging from 0 nm to 160 nm for each waist size . Each simulated localization was then convoluted by a 2D spatial Gaussian function with a waist of 200nm in x and y direction to simulate the point spread function of the microscope . The number of photons emitted by each simulated position was randomly distributed according a Gaussian distribution centered to a value equivalent to the one experimentally observed , this in order to obtain a localization precision equivalent to the experimental ones ( see Fig S3 for the experimental localization precision ) . Each set of simulated images was then analyzed using the Thunderstorm plugin of ImageJ with the same parameter as the one used for experimental data . Single molecule localizations obtained from this analysis were then used for CBC analysis using the CBC plugin of Thunderstorm as it was done for experimental data sets ( b to f ) .

IRSp53 , but not IRTKS , is localized at HIV - 1 Gag budding sites in host CD4 + Jurkat T cells as revealed by super resolution microscopy . a , Super resolved dual color PALM / STORM images of Jurkat T cells immuno - labelled with IRSp53 . As in Fig . 3 , HIV - 1 Gag molecules localization density based scan ( DBScan ) analysis reveals clusters size distribution within the known range of HIV - 1 particles size ( 80 - 150nm ) . b , Jurkat cells immuno - labelled with IRTKS show a Gag cluster size distribution within the same range using the same DBScan analysis . CBC values for IRSp53 ( c ) and IRTKS ( d ) were plotted as relative frequencies . c , IRSp53 CBC values show a peak of IRSp53 localizations ( 26 % ) highly correlated with Gag ( > 0 . 5 ) . d ) IRTKS CBC values show a peak at anti - correlated and non correlated ( - 0 . 5 to 0 ) . e ) Experimental CBC values for IRSp53 and IRTKS were plotted as cumulative frequency distributions to be compared to simulated distributions obtained at different distances and structures ( See Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . IRSp53 shows a cumulative CBC distribution corresponding to a simulation of waist at 40nm ( width 80 nm ) and a distance of 80nm ( left graph , bold grey line corresponds to experimental data for IRSp53 , bold blue line corresponds to simulated values closest to experimental data ) . IRSp53 thus corresponds to restricted pattern in and around a Gag assembly site ( panel 1 schematic of simulated data , panel 2 simulated data and panel 3 experimental data ) . d , IRTKS experimental CBC distribution ( bold grey line in graph ) is close to simulations of waist 100nm ( width 200nm ) and a distance of 140nm ( bold red line ) . IRTKS is more diffuse and spread out ( panel 1 schematic of simulated data , panel 2 simulated data and panel 3 experimental data ) . Scale bar in the panels = 100nm .
