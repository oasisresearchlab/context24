Methods : This was a case - ascertained study among unvaccinated household contacts of a laboratory - confirmed COVID - 19 case in New Delhi between December 2020 and July 2021 . For this study , 99 index cases and their 316 household contact were interviewed and sampled ( blood and oro - nasal swab ) on day 1 , 7 , 14 , and 28 . Results : The secondary infection rate among unvaccinated household contacts was 44 . 6 % ( 95 % Confidence Interval : 39 . 1 - 50 . 1 ) . The predictors of secondary infection among individual contact levels were being female ( Odd Ratio ( OR ) : 2·13 ) , increasing age ( OR 1·01 ) , symptoms at baseline ( OR 3·39 ) , and symptoms during the follow - up ( OR 3·18 ) . Among index level , age of the primary case ( OR 1·03 ) and symptoms during follow - up ( OR 6·29 ) , while among household - level and contact patterns , having more rooms ( OR 4·44 ) and taking care of the index case ( OR 2·02 ) , respectively were significantly associated with secondary infection . Conclusion : A high secondary infection highlights the need to adopt strict measures and advocate COVID - 19 appropriate behaviors . The targeted approach at higher risk household contacts would efficiently limit infection among susceptible contacts .

The uncertainty over its epidemiological behavior has made disease control even more challenging . Leaving the world paralyzed for almost two years , the resumption of normalcy will depend upon how well we understand its epidemiological behavior and the transmissibility pattern . Households being closed settings are a crucial component in spreading the respiratory disease as it played a dominant role in previous pandemics of swine flu ( H1N1 ) and severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) earlier [ 1 - 2 ] . Literature shows varied secondary infection rates of SARS - CoV - 2 in household contacts ranging from 4·6 % to 50 % [ 3 ] . Household - based studies provide an enumerable set of people exposed to an infectious person , therefore valuable in assessing SARS - CoV - 2 ' s key transmission dynamics [ 4 ] . Especially during lockdowns with limited interactions among community members and households , suspected contacts are in a closed setting , thus an opportunity to observe infectious disease transmission patterns . Thus , household settings allow determination of the virus ' s transmission dynamics and help understand the clinical spectrum of illness in secondary cases [ 2 ] . Overcrowding in households can increase the risk of transmission , supposedly leading to decreased effectiveness of lockdown and stay - at - home measures in low and middle - income countries ( LMICs ) , where providing a quality healthcare service for the entire population has been a challenge [ 5 ] . In early 2021 , India had the world ' s second - largest number of COVID - 19 cases [ 6 - 7 ] . The capital of India , New Delhi , witnessed two sharp peaks in 2020 and 2021 , the second wave being one of the deadliest , potentially linked to the new B . 1 . 617 . 2 ‘delta’ variant’s highly contagious nature [ 7 ] . The dynamics of transmission of COVID - 19 infection among household contacts are still unclear . Evidence suggests that COVID - 19 transmission among household contacts depends on several factors [ 8 ] . We conceptualized this phenomenon as governed by the interplay of four sets of factors ; index case characteristics , household level , individual level , and contact pattern 6 factors ( Figure 1 ) . Investigating the extent of infection among household contacts will provide helpful information on virus transmissibility and routes of transmission . Furthermore , this study will also help assess the reliability of our conceived four - dimensional approach to understanding COVID - 19 transmission dynamics among household contacts . Thus we did this study with the objectives of observing the secondary infection rate and understand the transmission dynamics of COVID - 19 among household contacts of COVID - 19 and its associations with various factors across four dimensions of interaction . { Insert Figure 1 } Figure 1 : Factors governing transmission dynamics among household members across proposed four dimensions . Disease transmission among household members is influenced by interplay of four sets of factors , including index case characteristics ( age , gender , presence of symptoms and their severity ) , household level ( household size , overcrowding , number of bedrooms , room for isolation ) , individual level ( age , gender , presence of symptoms , any comorbidity ) , and contact pattern ( interaction with index case in taking care , hugging , kissing , handshaking , sharing room and toilet , sharing meals and utensils ) 7 METHODOLOGY : The study was based on WHO UNITY protocols developed to investigate transmission dynamics and clinical spectrum of COVID - 19 infection and were supported by WHO for the generating standardized , quality and comparable studies [ 9 ] . Study setting and population : This was a prospective case - ascertained study conducted amongst the unvaccinated household contacts of laboratory - confirmed COVID - 19 patients residing in Delhi ' s South and South - East districts . The study was conducted from December 2020 to June 2021 , covering India’s first and second waves of the COVID - 19 pandemic . The first wave hit India in March 2020 and extended till December 2020 , peaking in mid - September , while the second , deadlier wave was observed between March to July 2021 [ 6 ] . During this period , whenever a new COVID - 19 positive patient was detected , contact tracing and 8 surveillance were performed by the district health authority for 14 days , and all the suspected contacts with symptoms were advised for testing , although no mandate existed . Inclusion criteria :  households with a confirmed COVID - 19 case identified with at least one household member .  all the contacts of the confirmed COVID - 19 cases residing in the same household .  residing in South and South - East districts of Delhi . Exclusion criteria :  the date of symptom onset of COVID - 19 was the same for more than one household member .  the cases and their contacts who were hospitalized on Day 1 .  Individuals residing in hostel accommodation . Operational Definitions : based on WHO unity protocol [ 9 ] ( Figure 2 )  Secondary case / infection : Those contacts who were enrolled AND confirmed for new infections of COVID - 19 assessed through Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) anytime within 28 days of follow - up .  Secondary Infection Rate : The proportion of household contacts confirmed positive for COVID - 19 assessed through RTPCR anytime within 28 days of follow - up divided by total enrolled contacts .  Seroconversion : Those contacts confirmed for new infections of COVID - 19 assessed through serological assays on paired samples with a change from initial negative to positive anytime within 28 days of follow - up .  Secondary Clinical Attack Rate : The proportion of household contacts with symptoms suggestive of COVID - 19 ( fever , sore throat , runny nose , cough , shortness of breath , loss 9 of smell or taste , muscle ache , headache ) within 14 days of index case testing positive divided by total enrolled contacts . This cut - off was taken from the district health authority’s contact tracing activity of 14 days , for comparison between Indian studies .  Secondary Attack Rate ( Cumulative SAR ) : The proportion of household contacts positive for COVID - 19 assessed through RTPCR within 14 days from index case testing positive divided by all contacts tested .  Household Secondary Attack Rate ( SAR ) : It was calculated at the household level . The proportion of enrolled household contacts positive for COVID - 19 assessed through RTPCR within 14 days from index case testing positive divided by all contacts tested .  Serial interval : The period from the onset of symptoms in the primary case to the onset of symptoms in a susceptible household contact , irrespective of their infection status .  Detectable shedding : The time required for the RTPCR positive case ( index and secondary ) to become negative .  Effective reproduction number R e : The number of infections , on average , produced by index cases in their household . { Insert Figure 2 } Figure 2 : Illustration of household - level transmission of COVID - 19 infection in our study population . Exposure to the primary case in the household is the first event followed by symptoms in him / her and a subsequent positive test for COVID - 19 . In our illustration , we enrolled primary case on Day 1 , shortly after he / she tested positive for COVID - 19 . We assumed that by Day 7 the primary case would have shredded all of the viruses and the PCR testing would be negative . Exposed household contacts may experience 10 symptoms during the second week , which can be used to calculate the incubation period ( time from exposure to onset of symptoms in contacts ) and the serial interval ( time from onset of symptoms in the primary case to onset in contact ) . The primary case would subsequently test positive for COVID - 19 on Day 14 assessment and can be used to calculate the generation time ( time between testing positive of primary case and contact ) . Sample size : Considering a secondary attack rate of 0·5 at the household level , we assumed a prevalence of 50 % [ 10 - 13 ] and taking 90 % power and 95 % confidence interval and applying Schwartz formula , the sample size came out to be 384 , which was rounded off to 400 household contacts . Assuming an average family size of five , we determined to include 100 households in our study . After identification of the index case , all eligible contacts in that household were enrolled . Those not consenting to participate in the study were excluded . 11 Study Tools : It comprises of  Baseline questionnaire  Follow up questionnaire  Symptom diary  Samples ( nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab and blood serum ) The face - to - face interviews of the cases ( or family members if the patient was too ill to be interviewed ) and household members was done to collect the information using baseline and follow - up questionnaire . The data collection team comprised trained healthcare workers and a phlebotomist visited the family at their house . All precautionary measures as per the government of India were followed during data collection . Baseline data and the samples were collected on the day of recruitment ( Day 1 ) , while follow - up data were collected during home visits on Day 7 , Day 14 , and Day 28 . Confirmation of COVID - 19 was done by molecular RT - PCR , and serology was done to identify the baseline antibody status and seroconversion ( Supplementary Figure 1 ) . All household contacts and index cases were provided a symptom diary to record the symptoms for 28 days . Laboratory analysis We collected nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal ( respiratory ) samples on Day 1 , 7 , 14 , and 28 , while serum samples on Day 1 , 14 , and 28 from all the study participants ( cases and contacts ) . Respiratory samples were analyzed by RT - PCR technique as per government of India guidelines . Serology was done as per the guidelines and testing strategies , utilizing WANTAI kits provided by WHO ( See supplementary material ) . Enrolment strategy : 12 The study was done at the COVID - 19 testing center of Hamdard Institute of Medical Science and Research ( HIMSR ) , New Delhi , and other testing centers . A list of patients who tested positive at HIMSR was prepared daily , and the first two patients giving consent were included in the study . However , due to the decline in the number of cases , deviation from the study protocol was done . After this , a list of COVID - 19 positive patients from two districts ( Delhi ' s South and South - East districts ) was assessed for enrolment [ Protocol deviation 1 ] . Further , retrospective enrolments were performed if we could not enrol in one particular week [ Protocol deviation - 1 ] . After the initial visit ( Day 1 ) , subsequent follow - up visits were conducted on days 7 , 14 , and 28 . In retrospective enrolments , the first visit was scheduled on Day 7 ( from index case testing positive ) . Statistical Analysis The data was entered in MS Excel and analyzed by IBM Statistical Package for Social Sciences ( SPSS ) Version 26 . The study datasets are available at the data depository as open access [ 14 ] . The categorical variables and proportions were represented by percentage ( % ) , while continuous variables were described by the mean and standard deviation or median with interquartile range wherever applicable . Association between various factors with primary outcome - secondary infection was assessed by logistic regression . All those variables , which were significant at p < 0·1 , were further analyzed using multiple logistic regression through the ‘enter’ method . Probability ( p ) was kept at a 5 % level of significance . Ethical considerations The study was part of the WHO unity protocol . It was approved by the WHO Research Ethics Review Committee ( ERC . 0003356 ) and Institutional Ethical Committee , HIMSR , New Delhi ( IEC - 2020 / 15 ) . The manuscript was further approved by Publications Review Committee WHO - HQ ( PRC - 21 - 120603 ) . The approvals from the district authority , hospital and medical college 13 were also taken . Informed and written consent was obtained from every participant after explaining the study ' s intended purpose , confidentiality , autonomy , and beneficence . Health education and referral , if required , were given appropriately . RESULTS We enrolled 99 index cases and their 316 household contacts in this study . Details of enrolment are given in Figure 3 . Table 1 shows the participants ' sociodemographics , while household characteristics are presented in Supplementary Table 1 , and the nature of contact is in Supplementary Table 2 . As shown in Table 1 , we had an equal gender distribution among household contacts ; however , more primary cases were male . The mean age among primary cases was 38·7 ± 14·4 years , while it was 33·3 ± 19·4 years among the contacts . The mean household size was 4·5 ± 2·0 , while the median number of rooms in the households was three . At the time of enrolment , 84 . 8 % ( 95 % Confidence Interval ( CI ) : 76 . 4 – 90 . 7 ) of index cases were symptomatic , while 29 . 7 % ( CI : 25 . 0 – 35 . 0 ) of household contacts also had complaints of them ; However , the proportion of symptomatic cases and contacts decrease with each follow - up ( Supplementary Table 3 ) . Supplementary Figure 2 shows the symptom profile of the index case , and Supplementary Figure 3 depicts the comorbidity profile of the index case and household contacts . { Insert Figure 3 } Figure 3 : Flow diagram describing study enrolments and participant eligibility for analyses . 14 { Insert Table 1 } { Insert Table 2 } Table 3 highlights the transmission dynamics of COVID - 19 among household contacts . The secondary infection rate among household contacts was 44 . 6 % ( CI : 39 . 1 - 50 . 1 ) . Among all COVID - 19 cases , 6 . 7 % ( CI : 4 . 1 - 10 . 6 ) were hospitalized , and the case fatality was found to be 1·7 % ( CI : 0 . 6 – 4 . 2 ) . The proportion of cases with symptoms was 77 . 9 % ( CI : 72 . 3 – 82 . 7 ) . The clinical attack rate was observed at 46·5 % ( 41 . 1 – 52 . 0 ) , while the secondary attack rate was 15 55 . 5 % ( CI : 49 . 4 – 61 . 6 ) . Other transmission dynamics , including serial interval , detectable shedding , and effective reproduction number , are also given in Table 3 . { Insert Table 3 } We analyzed the predictors of infection across the proposed four dimensions ; among contact level characteristics , if the contact was female , she had higher odds of testing COVID - 19 positive [ Odd Ratio ( OR ) : 2·13 , 95 % Confidence interval ( CI ) : 1·27 - 3·57 ) . Similarly , increasing age [ OR 1·01 ( 1·00 - 1·03 ) ] , presence of symptoms at baseline [ OR 3·39 ; 1·61 - 7·12 ] , and having symptoms during the follow - up [ OR 3·18 ; 1·64 - 6·19 ] was found to be significantly predicting COVID - 19 infection among the household contacts . Among index case - level characteristics , increasing age of index case [ OR 1·03 ; 1·01 - 1·04 ] and presence of symptoms [ OR 6·29 ; 1·83 - 21·63 ] had higher odds of testing COVID - 19 among household contacts , after adjusting for their gender . Among household - level characteristics , more rooms in the house [ OR 3·67 ; 1·77 - 7·59 ] significantly predicted COVID - 19 infection among the contacts , while household size and overcrowding were not significantly associated . Among contact patterns , those household members who took care of the index cases had higher odds of testing COVID - 19 positive [ OR 2·02 ; 1·21 - 3·38 ] , while other contact patterns were insignificant . { Insert Table 4 } DISCUSSION We did this study to understand the transmission dynamics of COVID - 19 among household contacts of index cases , along with clinical and epidemiological characteristics of the infection . We also tested our four dimensions of interaction in determining secondary infection among household contacts . 16 More males were observed among the index cases , whereas females outnumbered males in the secondary cases . Female household members were more likely to test COVID - 19 positive than males . This was also observed in a cohort study from China , where females had a higher risk ( RR = 1·6 ) than males [ 15 ] . In India , it is usually women who care for sick family members , increasing their risk of contracting the infection . In contrast , researchers from Spain found that the gender of the contact had no effect on disease transmission among contacts [ 16 ] . Few other studies have also found no association between gender and secondary infection , but found spouses of the index case to be at a higher risk [ 3 , 17 - 20 ] . We also observed increasing age of household contacts and index cases , to be a significant and independent predictor of secondary infection among household members . Researchers around the world have documented similar findings [ 15 - 17 ] , although few studies failed to record any significant relation between age and secondary infection [ 18 - 19 ] . In China , Zhang et al . studied the change in the pattern of transmission dynamics and concluded that younger individuals had a lower risk of infection than older individuals [ 13 ] The household we studied had an average of 4 . 4 members , and overcrowding was observed in 33 % of families . Since COVID - 19 is an infectious disease with high infectivity , we expected that a family with a large household size would have a higher secondary infection rate . However , we observed lower secondary infection rates in households with increasing household size and overcrowding , although these associations were not significant . A contrasting finding was observed with respect to the number of rooms , where we found significantly higher rates of secondary infection in households with more rooms . Thompson et al . found a trend of decreasing transmissibility with increasing household size , while Wang et al . observed that households with fewer contacts had a higher rates of secondary infection [ 21 - 22 ] . A similar trend is observed in studies done around the world , with higher SAR being higher among small households than larger ones [ 16 - 18 ] . 17 Looking at the dimension of index - contact interaction , the household members were more likely to be infected owing to their contact with the index case [ 23 ] . In our study , more than half of the members had shared a room , and one - third took care and shared a toilet . We observed that those contacts who cared for the index case had a higher risk of contracting infection , while other contact - level interactions were not significant . The findings from a systemic review suggested that the transmission among contacts is influenced by group interaction like sharing meals or playing board games [ 24 ] . A study conducted in Hangzhou , China , found that the risk of secondary infection was 31·6 times if they were family members and 2·6 times when they dined together [ 25 ] . Many of the index - contact interactions found significant by others did not show a similar association in our study . Early isolation and COVID - appropriate behavior , which the district administration mandated in the study population , could be a possible reasons . Since the household in our study had low rates of overcrowding and sufficient rooms for isolation , interaction with index cases was limited . However , we could not compare the data on the different types of contact among the household members , which could have a bearing on secondary infection . Regarding symptomatology , the primary cases showed more symptoms and longer duration than household contacts and secondary cases . Among household contacts who later tested positive ( secondary cases ) , two - thirds showed symptoms , a majority in the first week , while one - third were also symptomatic in the second week . Fever and sore throat were major complaints , followed by cough and muscle aches . Studies observed fever , cough , and sore throat as the most common clinical presentation [ 26 - 27 ] . The less common symptoms among our study participants were myalgia , fatigue , nausea , and vomiting , similar to studies done elsewhere [ 22 , 26 - 28 ] . Our study found secondary infections more among households where the primary case was symptomatic ( adjusted OR ( aOR ) : 3·4 ) . This finding supports that symptomatic index cases 18 transmit COVID - 19 infections to their contacts much more than asymptomatic cases [ 21 ] . This concurred with the finding of Madewell et al . , where the secondary attack rate ( SAR ) from symptomatic index cases was 18 % compared to the asymptomatic cases 0·7 % [ 17 ] . Other reviews and metanalysis too observed similar findings showing a higher SAR among symptomatic index cases than asymptomatic cases [ 3 , 16 - 17 , 19 - 20 , 29 - 30 ] . Majority of the household contact tested COVID - 19 positive in the first week , while positive serology was seen maximum at the last follow - up . The case hospitalization and the case - fatality ratio were 6·7 % & 1·7 % , respectively . The national figures for these are lower than our study , although studies among the specific population have reported similar or even higher rates [ 31 ] . These rates were also affected by the epidemic wave of diseases as well as circulating virus variants . Thus a more detailed trend - wise distribution of hospitalization and death among the enrolled cases along with genotyping would be more helpful in understanding the household transmission and severity of the disease . The serial interval was eight days , comparable to that found in China , ranging from 5·5 to 7·5 days [ 22 , 32 ] Among the transmission dynamic factors , we also calculated secondary attack rate ( SAR ) , cumulative as well as at households ; the cumulative SAR was 55·5 % , while the household SAR was 54·9 % . These proportions are very high compared to the previous studies , ranging from 9·3 % in South India , 11·1 % in Spain , 16 % - 34 % in China & 25 % in Japan [ 5 , 18 , 26 , 28 ] . A pooled SAR from meta - analysis was observed varying between 7 % and 21·1 % [ 17 , 20 - 21 , 33 ] . All of these are much lower than we observed . Some researchers have observed SAR to be similar or even higher rates . Similar rates are documented in Finland ( 48 % ) , Thai households ( 48 % ) , and China ( 54·9 % ) [ 11 - 13 , 34 ] . In the initial phase of the epidemic , researchers from Taiwan observed a high SAR of 84 % , while a small case series from South India also observed it as 60 % [ 10 , 35 ] . These discrepancies should be comprehended , keeping the methodological difference , especially the contacts ' enrolments . Our study actively ascertained the household contacts , irrespective of their symptoms and / or higher risk , would 19 have unearthed close to reality . In contrast , studies passively observing the attack rate of contacts presenting for testing may have underestimated . Further , this study was conducted during India ' s deadliest peak of COVID - 19 , with Delhi facing the most significant impact , resulting in a high SAR . A meta - regression analysis conducted by Tian et al . on studies measuring secondary attack rates in different settings indicated that the household and social gathering settings accounted for elevated SARs [ 33 ] . These differences in SAR could also be attributed to structural and virological differences between the viruses . The lower severity of SARS - CoV - 2 could have promoted household transmission , as most cases were kept under home isolation [ 17 ] . Since SAR depends not merely on the causative organism but other factors , such as environmental and sociodemographic factors , such heterogeneity is expected to be found [ 20 ] . One interesting finding was that despite a high SAR , we reported an effective reproduction number ( R e ) of 1·33 ±1·56 , which is lower in comparison to previous studies ( R0 = 3·38 ) [ 34 ] . This can be explained by the lower number of susceptible individuals among household contacts , as many were seropositive at the baseline . This supports the concept stated by Yang Liu , who considered that a higher SAR with a low R0 implies that only a tiny proportion of high - risk contacts were the driving force behind household - level transmission [ 36 ] . In our study , the women who were the primary caregivers of the index case were at the highest risk of contracting the infection among the household members . This finding shows that having a targeted high - risk approach could enable us to reduce the SAR and the R e . Our study also had a few limitations . Firstly , the convenience sampling to enroll the index case , reasonable refusals , and lost - to - followup during the four household visits could result in selection bias and affect the generalization of the findings . Secondly , due to daily household interactions , we could not ascertain the exact date of exposure with the index case required to calculate epidemiological characteristics with precision . Further , some definitions were based on symptoms non - specific to COVID - 19 , which may have overestimated the outcomes . At the time 20 of this study , there were half a dozen COVID - 19 variants ; genotyping studies would help understand transmission . Finally , while we calculated the sample size for estimating SAR , it may not be sufficient to find the predictors , even though we had more than 20 samples for each independent variable to regress . As this study was a part of the WHO Unity studies , pooling epidemiological data from other institutes globally would help us reduce these limitations to some extent . We conclude that the secondary attack rate in our setting was very high , highlighting the need to adopt strict measures and COVID - 19 appropriate behaviors . We also concluded that our multidimensional approach to understanding household transmission is relevant , with a significant relationship between secondary infection and many factors . Given the importance of individual - level and index case characteristics , a targeted approach at household contacts with higher risk would be efficient in limiting the development of infection among susceptible contacts .
