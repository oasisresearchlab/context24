457 The endosomal system is a major membrane - sorting apparatus . New evidence reveals that novel coat proteins assist specific sorting steps and docking factors ensure the vectorial nature of trafficking in the endosomal compartment . There is also good evidence for ubiquitin regulating passage of certain proteins into multivesicular late endosomes , which mature by accumulating invaginated membrane . Lipids play a central role in this involution process , as do the class E vacuolar protein - sorting proteins .

The endo - somal system , which is comprised of multiple vesicular compartments , also serves as collection site for receptors and other plasma - membrane ( PM ) proteins internalized from the cell surface . Internalized molecules rapidly enter early sorting endosomes , where they are either segregated into tubular membrane extensions or remain within the central portion . The central portion matures into the multivesicular body ( MVB ) / late endosome by involution of the limiting membrane ( Figure 1 ) . From endosomes , proteins may move to the lysosome / vacuole or recycle back to the TGN or cell surface for further rounds of transport . For many years , sci - entists have been working to define the pathways and the intermediate compartments through which cargo molecules pass , as well as to identify the coat proteins , membrane com - ponents and regulatory factors required for sorting and maturation in the endosomal system . New studies in animal cells and model organisms , particularly yeast , have led to enormous advances in our understanding of these processes and this review highlights some of the recent progress . Trafficking from the biosynthetic pathway : more coats and adaptors In animal cells , the major pathway for diverting lysosomal enzymes from the flow of proteins to the cell surface involves sorting at the TGN via mannose 6 - phosphate receptors ( MPRs ) [ 1 ] . MPR exit from the TGN takes place within clathrin - coated buds containing the AP - 1 adaptor , which is recruited by the small GTPase ARF1 . AP - 1 interacts directly with sorting signals in the MPR cytosolic tail . Although this is a major route for TGN exit of many lysosome - destined pro - teins in animal cells , additional adaptors and coats that may mediate sorting at the TGN have now been discovered . Novel GGA proteins at the TGN In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae , the major pathway to the vacuole is that followed by several soluble vacuolar hydro - lases ( e . g . carboxypeptidase Y [ CPY ] ) and membrane proteins ( e . g . the vacuolar ATPase and carboxypeptidase S [ CPS ] ) [ 2 ] . ProCPY transport to the vacuole is mediated by the Vps10p sorting receptor ( Table 1 ) , which collects cargo from the TGN for delivery to the prevacuole / endosome , before recycling back to the TGN . In addition , some resi - dent late Golgi membrane proteins ( e . g . Kex2p and dipeptidyl aminopeptidase A [ DPAP A ] ) cycle between the TGN and the prevacuole . Clathrin is important for retention of these latter TGN proteins , demonstrated by their appear - ance at the cell surface in clathrin mutants . However , clathrin and AP - 1 are not essential for sorting of CPY via Vps10p ( e . g . see [ 3 • , 4 • ] ) , so another pathway or sorting factor ( s ) is pro - posed to be upregulated or substitute for these coats . New candidates are the GGA ( Golgi - localizing , gamma - adaptin ear homology domain , ARF - binding ) proteins [ 5 • – 8 • ] . In ani - mal cells , GGA proteins are not enriched in clathrin - coated vesicles , but do behave as ARF - dependent coat proteins , localize to the TGN , and cause mislocalization of TGN pro - teins upon overexpression [ 5 • – 8 • ] . In yeast , gga1 gga2 knockouts partially missort CPY , and their fragmented vac - uolar morphology is reminiscent of a class of Vps mutants ( class F ) that affect sorting at the TGN [ 6 • , 8 • ] . Clathrin function without APs in yeast It is unlikely that in yeast AP - 1 can be functionally com - pensated for by one of the other two yeast AP - like complexes ( related to AP - 2 and AP - 3 ) or AP180 - related pro - teins , which associate with clathrin - coated vesicles in animal cells and bind clathrin in yeast . Yeast with multiple gene deletions removing all of these APs are able to sort CPY effi - ciently to the vacuole [ 3 • , 4 • ] . In fact , although clathrin mutants have a number of severe sorting and growth defects , multiple AP - mutant strains are essentially normal Sorting in the endosomal system in yeast and animal cells Sandra K Lemmon * and Linton M Traub † for all clathrin - related functions . In addition , they still form clathrin - coated vesicles . This surprising finding suggests that heterotetrameric adaptors and AP180 - related proteins are not required for clathrin - mediated transport in yeast . AP - 3 sorting Two other heterotetrameric adaptors , AP - 3 and AP - 4 , asso - ciate with the TGN in an ARF - dependent fashion . Although little is known about the function of AP - 4 [ 9 , 10 ] , AP - 3 is known to be important in lysosomal trafficking . This was illuminated by studies of mutants in yeast , as well as animals manifesting pigmentation defects [ 11 , 12 ] . Each AP - 3 subunit is represented in the Drosophila ‘granule group’ of eye - color mutations , which affect the delivery of proteins to lysosomes and pigment granules ( see Table 1 ) [ 12 – 14 ] . mocha and pearl mice have mutations in their AP - 3 δ and β 3A ( a non - neuronal β 3 isoform ) subunits , respec - tively [ 15 , 16 ] and are among several mutations that cause coat - and eye - color dilution and platelet storage pool defi - ciency . These mice are also models for Hermansky – Pudlak syndrome ( HPS ) , a related lysosomal disorder in humans affecting the lysosome - related organelles , melanosomes and platelet dense granules . Recently two HPS patients with mutations in β 3A were identified [ 17 •• ] . AP - 3 is also involved in the sorting of lysosome - associat - ed membrane proteins ( e . g . LAMP - 1 and LIMP - II ) . AP - 3 deficient fibroblasts show increased surface expres - sion of LAMPs but not of MPR [ 18 , 19 ] . However , the location at which AP - 3 sorts these proteins is still not completely resolved . There is evidence for TGN and endosomal distributions of AP - 3 and for both TGN to endosome or endosome to lysosome sorting by this adap - tor ( e . g . see [ 17 •• , 18 , 20 ] ) . In yeast , AP - 3 directs the vacuolar membrane proteins alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) and Vam3p , a vacuolar t - SNARE , to the vacuole via an alternative pathway from the well studied CPY pathway [ 11 ] . In animal cells , AP - 3 binds to clathrin and may have both clathrin - dependent and - independent sorting functions [ 19 , 21 ] , whereas in yeast , sorting via the AP - 3 pathway is clathrin independent [ 22 ] . Clathrin - independent AP - 3 sorting could still require an outer coat component to generate a vesicular intermediate . One candidate is Vps41p , which binds directly to Apl5p , the yeast AP - 3 δ subunit [ 23 •• ] . Also , formation of AP - 3 vesicles is blocked at the TGN in vps41 - ts mutants [ 23 •• ] . Vps41p might recruit the additional factors needed for budding from the TGN , but a coat - like function is appealing as Vps41p has a clathrin heavy chain homology region that may be involved in oligomerization . However , com - pared to AP - 3 mutants , a vps41 - ∆ mutation causes pleiotropic phenotypes including defective sorting of 458 Membranes and sorting Figure 1 Schematic representation of the endocytic system ( in yeast and non - polarized animal cells ) . The major trafficking routes through the endocytic system are indicated by the arrows , with spheres indicating transport steps involving known or surmised vesicular intermediates . The bifurcation in traffic flow from the TGN to both the early sorting endosome and to the MVB reflects the maturation process that underlies MVB formation . Initially , multiple fusion events involving vesicles from both the cell surface and the TGN deliver material to a newly forming early sorting endosome . Recycling components ( e . g . transferrin receptors ) are sorted into the tubular extensions of the structure , which contain the bulk of the membrane of the early sorting endosome , en route to the tubular recycling endosome or to the cell surface for direct recycling . Over time , the sorting endosome loses the capacity to fuse with PM - derived vesicles , but not with vesicles from the TGN . The radiating tubules are replaced by extensive internal membrane invaginations as the maturing endosome moves toward the center of the cell along microtubules . The available data indicate that in yeast , CPY ( not shown ) is delivered to a more mature prevacuolar compartment , whereas in animal cells , MPRs may preferentially enter the endocytic pathway at the early sorting endosome . Nevertheless , recent evidence suggests there is a pathway from the TGN to an early endosome in yeast as well and that recycling to the TGN may take place from either the early endosome or prevacuole , similar to animal cells . In yeast , current information supports the direct delivery of ALP to the vacuole in an AP - 3 - dependent process , although there is presently no evidence for a similar direct route to the lysosome in animal cells .

Furthermore , Vps41p ( also called Vam2p ) complexes with Vam6p / Vps39p , which localizes in struc - tures associated with the vacuole [ 25 ] .

We refer you to the Proteome Database ( http : / / www . proteome . com ) for further information , including alternative names , functional details , and other identifications . † Known or surmised functional counterparts of the yeast protein , or information on the related protein family in animals is listed . Much of this information can be accessed through the Proteome Database . Note that there are many sequences encoding proteins related to these yeast products in the EST and other databases . Species designations are : Dm , Drosophila ; Mm , Murine ; Hs , Human . Other pertinent references can be found in the Proteome Database . and questions about specificity of delivery and conver - gence of TGN and endocytic traffic are beginning to be addressed . In yeast , delivery of TGN vesicles to the pre - vacuole has been defined primarily by the class D Vps proteins , which includes Ypt51p / Vps21p Rab - like GTPase , Vac1p / Pep7p , a FYVE - domain protein that binds phos - phatidylinositol 3 - phosphate ( PtdIns ( 3 ) P ) , Vps45p , an endosomal Sec1p homologue , and the t - SNARE Pep12p [ 2 , 26 – 28 ] . These yeast proteins are analogous to compo - nents of the well studied animal cell Rab5 GTPase / EEA1 - FYVE protein effector complex [ 26 – 28 ] . This animal complex is required for fusion at the early endosome , where both TGN and endocytic traffic can con - verge and recycle . In contrast , the prevacuole is generally thought to be a later endosome , yet the convergence point for traffic from the cell surface ( e . g . see [ 29 • , 30 • ] ) . However , recent evidence indicates that endocytic and TGN traffic can meet in an early endosome in yeast as well [ 31 •• ] , similar to its mammalian counterparts [ 32 , 22 ] . Whether docking / fusion factors are unique or shared for PM - and TGN - derived vesicles converging on the endo - some is still being worked out . In yeast , Vps45p does not seem to be required for fusion of endocytic intermediates with the prevacuole [ 34 ] , whereas Vac1p , Vps21p , and Pep12p are required for transport from both pathways [ 30 • , 35 , 36 ] . Similarly , in animal cells , Rab5 / EEA1 may function with syntaxin 13 in endocytic early endosome fusion [ 37 ] and may act with syntaxin 6 in TGN to early endosome transport [ 38 ] . The role of specific v - SNAREs and t - SNAREs in these events is complicated by their abil - ity to function in multiple transport steps [ 39 ] . SNAREs must also be recycled after fusion in order to be reused , so localization may not be a reliable indicator of function . Therefore , further dissection of the functions of the dock - ing / fusion components will be crucial for understanding how directionality of membrane transport in the endosomal system is achieved . Biogenesis of and sorting within multivesicular bodies Morphologically identifiable MVBs are present in both yeast and animals and contain substantial amounts of inter - nal membrane . This compartment is downstream of the sorting endosome and carries material destined for the lysosome / vacuole . Certain proteins ( MPRs , Vps10p , furin ) recycle to the TGN from MVBs rather than early endo - somes , indicating that sorting is still ongoing as the MVB matures . Recent advances have been the appreciation of the role of lipids in maintaining the morphology and func - tion of the MVB and the identification of the class E Vps proteins as central regulators of MVB biogenesis . The role of lipids Long saturated acyl - chain - containing synthetic lipids traf - fic preferentially to the late endocytic compartment when added to mammalian cells in culture , whereas short - chain unsaturated lipids are sorted to the recycling endosome and returned to the cell surface [ 40 • ] . Different combina - tions of lipids are thus likely to be found in the MVB and early - endocytic compartment membranes . In addition , polyphosphoinositides are certainly involved in MVB function . In yeast , Vps34p , a PtdIns 3 - kinase , is required for proper sorting to the vacuole and wortmannin , an inosi - tide kinase inhibitor , perturbs trafficking to the lysosome in mammalian cells [ 28 , 41 • ] . Curiously , turnover of PtdIns ( 3 ) P requires vacuolar hydrolases [ 42 • ] , so it has been proposed that this lipid plays an important role in the formation of intralumenal vesicles discharged into the vac - uolar lumen on fusion of the prevacuolar compartment ( MVB ) with the vacuole [ 42 • ] . Fab1p , a PtdIns ( 3 ) P 5 - kinase is also involved [ 28 , 43 •• ] . This enzyme might consume PtdIns ( 3 ) P generated by Vps34p , thereby pro - ducing a spatially / temporally - distinct second messenger [ 28 ] . fab1 - ts mutants show rapid and massive expansion of the vacuole at the restrictive temperature . The expanded vacuole is poorly acidified and the transmembrane seg - ment of CPS , which is usually degraded within the vacuole lumen , remains associated with the limiting vacuolar mem - brane [ 43 •• ] . Intravacuolar vesicles are also absent in fab1 mutants that are unable to synthesize PtdIns ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 , so this lipid also seems important in the process of involution in the MVB [ 28 ] . Homologues of Fab1p , which complement a fab1 strain , have recently been identified in many organ - isms [ 44 , 45 ] , so we anticipate rapid clarification of the precise role of this lipid kinase in sorting . Lysobisphosphatidic acid ( LBPA ) , a relatively rare phos - pholipid , is enriched in mammalian MVBs [ 46 ] . Ingested anti - LBPA antibodies accumulate within MVBs , altering both the morphology and function of the organelle [ 46 , 47 •• ] . MPRs and unesterified cholesterol become entrapped within these aberrant , LAMP - positive endo - somes . The flow of LDL - derived unesterified cholesterol from the late endosome / lysosome is regulated by NPC1 , a large polytopic transmembrane protein with a sterol - sensing domain [ 48 • ] that is mutated in the majority of patients with Niemann - Pick type - C ( NPC ) disease . In NPC1 - mutant fibroblasts , LBPA abnormally codistributes with accumulat - ed cholesterol in MVBs positive for both MPRs and LAMPs [ 47 •• ] . Thus , abnormalities in the lipid composition of the MVB prevent certain recycling proteins from segregating away from lysosome - destined material , demonstrating that lipid composition , membrane involution and protein sorting in the late endosome are tightly coupled . Protein regulators Mutation of any of the 13 class E Vps proteins in yeast causes accumulation of CPY , Vps10p , endocytosed pro - teins , and late - Golgi proteins ( such as Kex2p and DPAP A , which usually recycle back from the prevacuole ) with - in aberrant perivacuolar endosomes . The overall phenotype is consistent with a generalized failure in late endosomal sorting , traffic stalling in an acidified com - partment of stacked tubular structures — the E compartment [ 2 , 43 •• ] . Mammalian homologues of a few 460 Membranes and sorting class E proteins are now also being functionally charac - terized ( Table 1 ) ; the results confirm that class E proteins are central regulators of late endosome function and MVB involution . One class E regulatory protein , Vps4p , is a member of the AAA ATPase family . It cycles onto membranes in an ATP - dependent manner [ 49 ] . An ATPase - defective form of Vps4p collects on the class E compartment and is associat - ed with a large , detergent - insoluble structure [ 49 ] . Vps4p might disassemble a class E – protein complex required for invagination of MVB membranes , much like N - ethyl - maleimide - sensitive factor disassembles SNARE complexes . Evidence for this comes from the demonstra - tion that two other class E proteins ( Vps24p and Vps32p ) , which are also found in higher organisms , accumulate at the same sites in vps4 ATPase mutants [ 49 ] . Studies on mouse ( SKD1 ) and human ( hVPS4 ) Vps4p homologues support this idea . An ATP - restricted point mutant causes severe endosomal abnormalities and sorting defects in transfected cells [ 50 •• , 51 •• ] . Dilated vacuoles positive for LAMPs , MPRs , unesterified cholesterol , transferrin and EEA1 develop , which , by EM , appear as a profusion of tangled tubular / vesicular structures closely opposed , and occasionally connected , to a large central electron - lucent vacuole [ 50 •• , 51 •• ] . The phenotype induced by the mutant Vps4p homologues is strikingly similar to that induced by wortmannin [ 41 • ] , arguing that the E compartment might be equivalent to the dilated vacuoles that arise in wort - mannin - treated mammalian cells . Thus , it is probable that Vps4p functions along the pathway that requires PtdIns ( 3 ) P formation . Retrograde traffic to the TGN and the recycling machinery Although the pathways followed by membrane proteins returning to the TGN from endosomes are becoming clearer , the machinery involved is only beginning to emerge . In both yeast and animals , proteins can return to the Golgi from early or late endosomes . Shiga toxin B frag - ment or a chimeric protein containing the cytoplasmic tail of the TGN protein , TGN38 , are transported directly via early / recycling endosomes to the TGN [ 52 , 53 ] , whereas furin and MPRs are transported back to the Golgi from the late endosome [ 32 , 54 • ] . This distinction is not merely due to the latter proteins being delivered directly to the late endosome from the TGN . Furin and MPRs can return to the TGN from the cell surface following a path - way that takes them through early sorting and then late endosomes [ 54 • ] . Also , the bulk of newly synthesized MPRs enter the endosomal system at the sorting endo - some , where transferrin receptors are being segregated for return to the cell surface ( see update ) . MPRs also require Rab7 to progress from early to late endosomes prior to recycling the TGN [ 32 , 33 ] . In yeast , the secretory v - SNARE Snc1p recycles to the TGN from the early endosome after internalization , whereas Vps10p returns via the late endosome / prevacuole [ 2 , 31 •• ] . Information on the machinery that mediates retrieval from the endosome to the Golgi in animal cells is still relatively limited . Retrograde transport from the late endosome appears to be vesicle mediated and requires the small GTPase Rab9 [ 55 ] . Dynamin associates with late endo - somes and seems to play a role in recycling of MPR to the TGN [ 56 ] . Microtubules and microtubule - associated pro - teins improve the efficiency of MPR return [ 57 ] . In a few cases , cargo - selective components have been identified , such as TIP47 for retrieval of MPR [ 58 ] and PACS - 1 , which interacts with the furin cytosolic tail [ 59 ] . Clues to other components involved in endosomal retrieval have emerged from investigation of vps and Golgi reten - tion defective ( grd ) mutants in yeast . Some of these mutants secrete proCPY and display rapid mislocalization of Vps10p , Kex2p and A - ALP , a chimeric model TGN pro - tein , to the vacuole [ 2 ] . This retrieval phenotype is distinct from that of many other vps mutants , where transport is blocked at an intermediate step along the forward pathway to the vacuole . A set of these retrieval mutants define the components of a complex that has properties of a vesicle coat , termed the retromer [ 60 ] . The retromer assembles from two subcomplexes : one includes Vps35p , Vps29p and Vps26p / Pep8p , and a second includes Vps5p and Vps17p . The Vps35p component may play a direct role in cargo selection , as cargo - specific alleles of VPS35 that affect retrieval of Vps10p but not A - ALP ( and vice versa ) have been isolated [ 61 • ] . Vps5p localizes to the budding rims of the prevacuole and it has self - assembly properties , sug - gesting that it may play a more general structural role in vesicle formation [ 60 ] . Interestingly , Vps5p is related to mammalian sorting nex - ins 1 and 2 ( SNX1 , SNX2 ) and other proteins with a phox homology ( PX ) domain originally identified in the 40 and 47 kDa subunits of NADPH oxidase [ 62 , 63 ] . In yeast , this includes Mvp1p , which may function in vesicle budding at the TGN [ 64 ] and Grd19p [ 65 ] , which is related to SNX3 [ 63 ] . Grd19p has also been implicated in endosomal retrieval of DPAP A and Kex2p , but not Vps10p , via direct association with DPAP A / Kex2p sorting signals [ 65 ] . SNX1 and SNX2 bind to the cytosolic domains of a number of receptor tyrosine kinases ( RTKs ) and other internalized receptors and localize to perinuclear vesicles [ 62 , 63 ] . Recently , human orthologs of Vps26p , Vps29p and Vps35p were characterized and shown to associate with SNX1 / 2 in a multimeric complex [ 66 ] . Thus , although we still do not understand the exact function of the SNX1 / 2 retromer - like complex , it is likely to play a role in endosomal trafficking . Three new vps mutants — vps52 , vps53 and vps54 — have similar sorting phenotypes to those described for retromer mutants [ 67 •• ] . However , these proteins form a peripheral membrane complex that localizes to the TGN , rather than the prevacuole , suggesting that this complex may be involved in docking or fusion of retrograde vesicles [ 67 •• ] . Retrograde transport from the early endosome involves Sorting in the endosomal system Lemmon and Traub 461 Vps45p and the t - SNAREs Tlg1p and Tlg2p [ 31 •• ] , which may be required for docking of return vesicles at the TGN . However , class E Vps proteins or retromer sub - units , which are required for retrieval from the prevacuolar endosome , are not required for retrieval from the early endosome . So far it is not known whether Vps45p , Tlg1p and Tlg2p are also required for retrograde transport from the late endosome / prevacuole , or whether Vps52p , Vps53p and Vps54p are used in early endosome retrieval . Now that cargo proteins are available to follow both retrieval pathways in yeast [ 31 •• ] and animal Vps52 , Vps53 , Vps54 homologues can be examined [ 67 •• ] it should be possible to address these questions . Regulated sorting of proteins in the endosomal system : role of ubiquitin In response to alterations in nutrient status or ligand bind - ing , PM proteins , such as signal - transducing receptors and small - molecule permeases , can be rapidly removed or downregulated by endocytosis and degraded in the lyso - some / vacuole . This process is an important mechanism for cellular regulation , as exemplified by the loss of cell growth control when growth factor receptors cannot be internalized . Ubiquitination is a key mechanism for target - ing surface proteins for internalization and downregulation [ 68 ] and new evidence suggests that this may also regulate sorting at the endosome and TGN ( see also update ) . Ligand - stimulated RTKs , such as the EGF receptor ( EGFR / ErbB - 1 ) , are internalized and sorted into internal compartments of MVBs for transport to the lysosome , whereas unstimulated receptors are more efficiently recy - cled to the cell surface . A factor regulating this is the tyrosine kinase adaptor Cbl , which was originally identi - fied as a viral oncogene in mice [ 69 ] . Overexpression of c - Cbl increases ligand - induced ubiquitination and down - regulation of EGFR and a number of other RTKs [ 70 •• , 71 – 73 , 74 • ] . Cbl does not accelerate internalization of EGFR but may function at the endosome to facilitate sort - ing into MVBs , thereby attenuating kinase signaling [ 70 •• ] . Still , there may be other factors that determine sorting of EGFR into MVBs , as a dileucine signal in the cytosolic portion of EGFR seems to be required for diversion of the receptor from the recycling pathway [ 75 ] . c - Cbl contains an amino - terminal phosphotyrosine - bind - ing ( PTB ) domain and a central C 3 HC 4 RING - H finger ( RF ) domain [ 69 ] . The amino - terminal PTB is required for receptor binding . The RF domain stimulates receptor ubiquitination [ 73 , 76 , 77 •• , 78 , 79 •• , 80 ] , similar to other RF proteins that serve as E3 ligases for E2 ubiquitin - conjugat - ing enzymes [ 81 ] . A question that remains is whether the ubiquitinated receptors are degraded in lysosomes or by the proteasome . Studies using lysosomal protease and pro - teasome inhibitors have implicated both pathways in degradation ( e . g . [ 74 • , 79 •• ] ) . However , inhibition of pro - teasomal degradation of ubiquitinated proteins can deplete intracellular ubiquitin pools [ 82 • ] , which might lead to reduced ubiquitination of the target receptor and resistance to downregulation . Another protein that may regulate sorting into MBVs is the class E Vps protein , Vps23p ( or Stp22p ) , which is related to TSG101 , the tumor susceptibility gene product in animals [ 83 •• , 84 ] . In tsg101 mutant cells , much of the cellular pool of MPR spills out to the cell surface , and processing of the lysosomal enzyme cathepsin D is impaired . Although inter - nalization and recycling of transferrin receptors is normal , downregulation of activated EGFR is markedly attenuated because in the tsg101 mutant the receptor is efficiently recycled , along with MPRs , back to the surface [ 83 •• ] . Mutant Vps23p also permits recycling of damaged Ste2p to the cell surface in yeast ( see below ) [ 84 ] . Interestingly , TSG101 and Vps23p contain a domain related to E2 ubiq - uitin - conjugating enzymes [ 83 •• , 84 ] . These are unlikely to catalyze ubiquitination because they lack the active - site cysteine , but perhaps these proteins are involved in ubiq - uitin recognition or modification . TSG101 / Vps23p could bind to ubiquitinated membrane proteins to direct them into forming multivesicular late endosomes , or they might act as E3 accessory proteins regulating ubiquitination of cargo . Alternatively , the sorting machinery itself could be regulated by ubiquitination ( see also update ) . Ubiquitin modification may also be involved in regulated sorting of amino - acid permeases from the TGN in yeast . The tryptophan permease , Tat2p , is expressed at the sur - face in nitrogen - rich conditions , but it is diverted from the Golgi to the vacuole during nitrogen starvation [ 85 •• ] . Inverse regulation is observed for the general amino - acid permease , Gap1p [ 86 ] . In both cases , there is a large pool of internal permease that is turned over , along with surface permease , under downregulating conditions . Mutation of the sites of Tat2p ubiquitin modification stabilizes both internal and surface Tat2p , suggesting that ubiquitination is required for diverting intracellular Tat2p directly to the vacuole [ 85 •• ] . A similar mechanism for re - routing of Gap1p from the Golgi to the vacuole in nitrogen - rich con - ditions is likely , although in both cases , the location of internal ubiquitination and the ubiquitination factors responsible are not known . Another type of regulated sorting that can take place in the TGN / endosomal system is a quality control system that mediates turnover of misfolded soluble or membrane pro - teins [ 87 – 89 ] . In yeast , certain misfolded Ste2p and plasma - membrane ATPase ( Pma1p ) mutants escape ER quality control , but are directed to the vacuole for degra - dation at the level of the TGN without reaching the cell surface [ 88 , 89 ] . The phenotypic consequences of loss of localization at the cell surface can be suppressed by a num - ber of vps mutants , including vps23 ( TSG101 ) [ 84 , 90 ] . How these proteins are recognized as misfolded in the first place is not entirely clear . Vps10p , which has distinct domains for recognition of vacuolar hydrolases and unfold - ed ligands , may function in quality control [ 84 , 87 , 91 ] . Also , 462 Membranes and sorting misfolded Ste2p accumulates in higher mw species , sug - gesting a role for post - translational modification , possibly ubiquitination , in this process [ 89 ] . Conclusions Membrane flow through the endosomal compartment is both enormously complex and precisely regulated . The past few years have clarified some of the many different sorting itineraries , and important new tools , including mutants and chimeric and tagged proteins , are available for following the precise trajectory of cargo proteins . Until recently , the factors required for MVB involution and sorting were largely unknown . The finding that yeast class E vps mutations affect late endosome maturation , and the realization that lipids and possibly ubiquitination play a role in sorting at the endosome , will allow us to characterize this process in detail . There are still many questions to address regarding vesicle formation and docking in the endosomal system . In a few cases , cargo - selective components , such as the retromer and AP - 3 , are known , and a number of factors involved in fusion with the endosome or TGN have been identified . However , what other factors are involved in regulating recruitment of coats for budding or attachment of the vesicle to the target membrane ? Also , many components seem to be used at multiple transport steps , so a major challenge is to identify the specialized factors that provide directionality to sorting within these compartments . The high degree of conservation though metazoan evolution will continue to facilitate studies in this field and enable us to advance to the next step of deciphering the mechanistic details of sorting in the endosomal system . Update A recent study , following transferrin uptake in cells stably transfected with GFP - tagged Rab proteins , reveals that early endosomes contain morphologically discernible sub - domains , demarcated by discrete Rab proteins [ 92 •• ] . As transferrin recycles along the endocytic pathway , it overlaps sequentially with Rab5 , then Rab4 and then Rab11 . These GTPases can be found on continuous membrane structures ( a single endosome ) but do not appear to mix significantly . A novel F - box protein , Rcy1p , is required for transport out of the early endosome in yeast [ 93 • ] . While internalization is normal , mutant Rcy1p leads to accumulation of endocyt - ic markers in an early endosomal compartment , preventing both recycling to the cell surface and transport on to the prevacuole . Interestingly , several members of the F - box family of proteins mediate ubiquitination of substrates as components of SKP1 / cullin / F - box ubiquitin ligase com - plexes . Therefore , Rcy1p may function in a ubiquitination pathway that regulates transport in the endosomal system .

In vps21 mutants , TGN - and endocytically - derived vesicles accumulate in distinct intermediates blocked before prevacuole fusion , indicating that Vps21 is involved in delivery of vesicle intermediates from both pathways . This also suggests that TGN and endocytic vesicles are normally delivered to the prevacuole / late endosome , although it cannot be ruled out that vps21 blocks fusion with both early and late endosomes . 31 .

After fusion with the plasma membrane , the exocytic v - SNARE , Snc1p , is re - internalized and recycled from early endosomes to the TGN .

As the recy - cling of Snc1p is not blocked by mutations that prevent retrieval from the prevacuolar endosome , Lewis et al . argue that this recycling compartment is an early endosome , distinct from the prevacuole . Moreover , these results suggest that TGN - resident proteins can follow a pathway from the TGN to the early endosome . 32 .

Fluorescent lipid analogues added to culture medium label the surface of cells and are endocytosed , together with transferrin receptors , into common early sorting endosomes . Although short unsaturated acyl - chain probes then enter the recycling endosome with the transferrin receptor , long saturated acyl - chain probes segregate from this path and enter morphologically dis - tinct late endosomes . This indicates that early and late endosomes can be distinguished by different bilayer properties that probably also affect protein sorting events 41 .

However , MPR and MHC class II are found in sep - arate swollen vacuoles .

EMBO J 1998 , 17 : 4930 - 4942 . Ablation of fusion between the prevacuolar compartment and the vacuole caus - es an ~ five - fold increase in cellular PtdIns ( 3 ) P levels . Similar results are obtained if vacuolar hydrolase activity is inhibited . In these cells , where MVB - vacuole 464 Membranes and sorting fusion is intact , the vacuole interior is filled with many small vesicles . Turnover of PtdIns ( 3 ) P seems , therefore , to require membrane delivery to the vacuole . 43 .

On sorting CPS to the vacuole , the protease is processed , releasing the cat - alytic portion from the membrane . Compromising vacuolar function by delet - ing a vacuolar ATPase subunit gene allows CPS to be visualized within intravacuolar vesicles . Inactivation of Fab1p , a PtdIns ( 3 ) P 5 - kinase causes the cytosolic and transmembrane portions of CPS to remain associated with the limiting vacuolar membrane . This indicates that PtdIns ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 is impor - tant in getting CPS into the lumen of the vacuole , presumably by facilitating involution into the MVB . Internalized Ste2p also enters the vacuole via this pathway . Further , Class E Vps proteins seem to be required at the stage of MVB formation and / or sorting . 44 .

Genes Dev 1998 , 12 : 3663 - 3674 . This study provides evidence that c - Cbl mediates ligand induced downreg - ulation of the EGF receptor ( ErbB - 1 ) in the early endosome , possibly by pro - moting sorting of the receptor into the MVB pathway . This downregulation requires receptor kinase activity and involves c - Cbl - dependent covalent attachment of ubiquitin to EGF receptor . Oncogenic Cbl inhibits downregu - lation by allowing recycling to the cell surface . 71 .

Mol Cell 1999 , 4 : 1029 - 1040 . Ligand - bound EGF receptor undergoes tyrosine autophosphorylation at a lysosomal - targeting motif , which serves as a docking site for c - Cbl via its PTB domain . This binding is followed by tyrosine phosphorylation of c - Cbl at a site flanking the RING - H finger , enabling activation of c - Cbl E3 ubiquitin ligase activity . 80 .

This paper shows that inhibition of recycling of conjugated ubiquitin in doa4 yeast depletes ubiquitin pools and thereby impairs ubiquitin - dependent processes , including receptor downregulation . Interestingly , the evidence from this paper suggests that endocytosed plasma membrane proteins may be deubiquitinated by cytosolic deubiquitinating enzymes before their deliv - ery and degradation in the vacuole . 83 . Babst M , Odorizzi G , Estepa EJ , Emr SD : Mammalian TSG101 and •• the yeast homologue , Vps23p , both function in late endosomal trafficking . Traffic 2000 , 1 : 248 - 258 . TSG101 and Vps23p ( a class E vps ) are involved in MVB formation and late endosome maturation . Deletion of VPS23 causes CPS to accumulate in the perivacuolar class E compartment with abnormal proteolytic processing . Mutation of tumor susceptibility gene 101 ( TSG101 ) , the mouse homologue of VPS23 , causes an analogous defect in cathepsin D delivery to the lyso - some . Endocytosis and recycling are normal in tsg101 mutants , but traffick - ing of both MPRs and activated EGF receptors into MVBs is disrupted , which causes them to recycle back to the surface efficiently . Impaired down - regulation of EGF - receptor signaling leads to chronic MAPK activation that probably explains the tumor - susceptibility phenotype . 84 .

J Cell Biol 2000 , 149 : 901 - 904 . This study , following transferrin uptake in cells stably transfected with GFP - tagged Rab proteins , reveals that early endosomes contain morphologically dis - cernible subdomains , demarcated by discrete Rab proteins [ 92 (cid:127)(cid:127) ] . As transferrin recycles along the endocytic pathway , it overlaps sequentially with Rab5 , then Rab4 and then Rab11 . These GTPases can be found on continuous membrane structures ( a single endosome ) but do not appear to mix significantly . 93 . Wiederkehr A , Avaro S , Prescianotto - Baschong C , • Haguenauer - Tsapis R , Riezman H : The F - box protein Rcy1p is involved in endocytic membrane traffic and recycling out of an early endosome in Saccharomyces cerevisiae . J Cell Biol 2000 , 149 : 397 - 410 . A novel F - box protein , Rcy1p , is required for transport out of the early endo - some in yeast [ 93 (cid:127) ] . While internalization is normal , mutant Rcy1p leads to accumulation of endocytic markers in an early endosomal compartment , pre - venting both recycling to the cell surface and transport on to the prevacuole . Interestingly , several members of the F - box family of proteins mediate ubiqui - tination of substrates as components of SKP1 / cullin / F - box ubiquitin ligase complexes . Therefore , Rcy1p may function in a ubiquitination pathway that regulates transport in the endosomal system . 466 Membranes and sorting
