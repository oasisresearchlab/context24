Atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) offers great potential for this prospering ﬁeld . Traditionally used as an imaging tool , more recent developments have extended the vari - ety of cell - manipulation protocols . Fluidic force micros - copy ( FluidFM ) combines AFM with microﬂuidics via microchanneled cantilevers with nano - sized apertures . The crucial element of the technology is the connection of the hollow cantilevers to a pressure controller , allow - ing their operation in liquid as force - controlled nanopip - ettes under optical control . Proof - of - concept studies demonstrated a broad spectrum of single - cell applica - tions including isolation , deposition , adhesion and in - jection in a range of biological systems . Introduction The atomic force microscope [ 1 ] was invented in the 1980s to reach beyond the limits of the scanning tunneling micro - scope [ 2 ] by obtaining atomic - resolved images not only of conductive monocrystalline surfaces but also of insulating surfaces . Atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) in its most stan - dard conﬁguration features a pyramidal tip at the extremity of a ﬂexible cantilever that acts as a spring [ 3 ] ( Figure 1 ) . The cantilever is ﬁxed to an x - y - z piezo , and the tip is scanned on a surface while the deﬂection of the cantilever in response to the tip – surface interaction is monitored with a laser beam [ 3 , 4 ] . After becoming a standard tool in surface science , AFM entered the ﬁeld of biology . Its attractiveness for biological studies initially arose from its compatibility with a liquid environment and the multifunctionality of its tip , which can be used not only to image living biological objects and biomolecules but also as a manipulation tool at the nano - scale [ 5 – 7 ] : it can be utilized for force spectroscopy to quan - tify interactions from the molecular to the cellular level , single - cell injection and extraction , and mechanical sensing ( i . e . , the detection of biomolecules and cell viability [ 8 ] via cantilever deﬂection ) . A recent extension of AFM is repre - sented by the invention of ﬂuidic force microscopy ( FluidFM ) [ 9 ] , which combines a conventional atomic force microscope mounted on top of an optical microscope with microchan - neled cantilevers that are connected to a pressure controller for operation in liquid [ 10 ] . Together with complementary AFM applications , FluidFM offers perspectives for addres - sing some of the challenges of single - cell biology . In particu - lar , FluidFM allows the isolation of single cells , which is important for elucidating cell heterogeneity and cell – cell communication , and allows for well - controlled perturbation experiments . Here , we describe breakthroughs for single - cell biology obtained with AFM using conventional cantilevers [ 3 ] , discuss the current limitations , and present how FluidFM can help overcome several shortcomings of conventional AFM . Optical [ 11 ] and magnetic [ 12 , 13 ] tweezers , which also enable the manipulation of individual cells in suspen - sion but apply forces only in the pN range , have been reviewed elsewhere [ 14 , 15 ] and will not be discussed here . Single - cell manipulation using conventional AFM cantilevers High - resolution imaging At ﬁrst sight , imaging and manipulation are in antithesis , given that the tip – sample interaction should be minimized to avoid damaging the sample or inducing artifacts during imaging . By contrast , these two modalities can be com - bined because high - resolution AFM images provide the ability to precisely select a position for subsequent manip - ulation and / or visualizing the effects of manipulation . The atomic resolution obtained by AFM on monocrystalline hard surfaces has the potential to visualize subcellular structures , overcoming the Abbe diffraction limit for opti - cal microscopy ( approximately 250 nm ) . Erythrocytes and bacteria dried onto glass coverslips were the ﬁrst cells to be imaged using AFM [ 16 ] , and blood cells were imaged in physiological buffer one year later [ 17 , 18 ] . The tip interac - tion with a soft material , tip convolution effects , thermal motion , and hydrated layers lower the lateral resolution to approximately 20 nm when scanning cells . A new trend was launched with the invention of high - speed AFM by Ando and coworkers [ 19 ] ; high - speed AFM is able to Review 0167 - 7799 / (cid:2) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd . http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . tibtech . 2014 . 04 . 008 Corresponding authors : Zambelli , T .

TIBTEC - 1164 ; No . of Pages 8 Trends in Biotechnology xx ( 2014 ) 1 – 8 1 generate images of biomolecules that are supported on hard substrates [ 20 ] , as well as cell membranes [ 21 ] , at a video rate . High - speed AFM has also been adapted to scan larger areas , enabling the fast acquisition of whole - bacteria images so that dynamic changes can be followed on exposure to an antibiotic [ 22 ] . Moreover , chemical force microscopy , which uses a tip functionalized with a speciﬁc molecule , enables the mapping of local chemical interac - tions at the nanoscale [ 23 – 25 ] . Finally , as an alternative to AFM for imaging , scanning ion conductance microscopy [ 26 ] enables ‘hopping mode’ imaging of living cells with a 20 nm resolution without contacting the cell [ 27 ] . Retraction force spectroscopy and cell adhesion In contrast to scanning in the x - y plane to acquire topo - graphical images as described above , the movement of the AFM tip can be conducted exclusively in the z - axis , at a ﬁxed ( x o , y o ) point on the surface , for force spectroscopy experiments . Such measurements provide force – distance curves by approaching the surface ( forward curves ) and retracting the tip ( backward curves ) at a given tip velocity , from which quantitative information regarding interaction forces can be extracted . Cell adhesion is important for a wide spectrum of bio - logical processes . Microbial adhesion represents an essen - tial step in bioﬁlm formation , survival , the development of speciﬁc functions within communities , and pathogenesis . Similarly , the adhesion of mammalian cells has a critical role in embryonic development , tissue morphogenesis , and inﬂammation . In single - cell force spectroscopy ( SCFS ) , a cell is attached to the AFM cantilever prior to force mea - surement . SCFS covers a wide force range of more than four orders of magnitude ( (cid:2) 10 pN to (cid:2) 100 nN ) . Thus , SCFS is sensitive enough to detect the unbinding of single receptor / ligand pairs [ 28 , 29 ] , while also allowing for the measurement of whole cell adhesion forces building - up during several tens of minutes of substrate contact of fungal [ 30 – 32 ] , mammalian [ 33 , 34 ] , and bacterial cells [ 32 , 35 , 36 ] . Despite its numerous advantages , conventional SCFS suffers from experimental limitations that relate , in par - ticular , to the binding of cells to the AFM cantilever . SCFS measurements require the cell – cantilever coupling to be stronger than the adhesive interaction probed . Cell attach - ment to the cantilever is usually augmented by coating the cantilever with an adhesive , such as lectins [ 37 , 38 ] , strep - tavidin [ 39 , 40 ] , or polydopamine [ 32 , 35 ] , before applying gentle contact to the cell . However , these immobilization techniques may perturb the cell , potentially inﬂuencing the subsequently measured adhesion forces . For instance , the attachment protocol may induce non - physiological re - ceptor clustering at the cantilever – cell interface , leading to receptor crosstalk across the probed cell and changing adhesive forces at the cell – substrate interface [ 41 ] ; cells may even become metabolically inactivated when chemical ﬁxation is used in the attachment process [ 32 ] . Addition - ally , for each probed cell , an AFM cantilever must be functionalized , thermally equilibrated and force calibrat - ed , making SCFS a time - intensive technique yielding only a few measured cells ( from 1 to 5 ) per condition in most studies , questioning their statistical relevance with re - spect to the intrinsic cell - to - cell variability . Recently , a nanorobotic system provided with two inde - pendently actuated AFM probes enabled quantiﬁcation of living cell adhesion forces , circumventing the need for cell attachment to the probe before measurement . The dual - probe nanotweezer allowed the detachment of single living C2C12 mouse myoblasts in an aqueous environment [ 42 ] . Forward force spectroscopy to measure cell elasticity Cell stiffness represents another relevant parameter in multiple biological processes . For mammalian cells , varia - tions in cell elasticity are observed , for example , during embryonic development , tissue morphogenesis , tumor me - tastasis , and inﬂammation . For microorganisms , elasticity measurements provide insights into the local composition and architecture of their cell walls , dynamic changes as - sociated with cell growth and division , or after incubation with drugs . The AFM tip can be used as a pyramidal indenter to assess surface elasticity by ﬁtting indentation curves ( i . e . , forward force – distance curves ) to a contact - mechanics model [ 43 ] . Indentation experiments to deter - mine cell stiffness have been performed on various cell types , usually yielding Young’s moduli in the range of kPa for soft mammalian cells and ranging up to MPa for yeast cells [ 44 – 46 ] . Furthermore , by recording arrays of curves over a cell surface , elasticity maps can be created to reveal local variations in the mechanical properties with a reso - lution in the tens of nanometers range [ 47 ] . For instance , bacterial membranes and their mechanical variations as - sociated with antibiotic treatment were characterized by elasticity maps [ 48 , 49 ] .

Schematic representation of an atomic force microscope . Forces affecting the cantilever tip cause bending of the cantilever , which is measured via the reflection of a laser beam onto a photodetector [ 4 ] . An x - y piezoelectric scanner allows for scanning the tip over a sample , whereas a z - piezo and a feedback system enable vertical tip position control . The force F exerted on the tip is related to cantilever’s deflection d and spring constant k ; the deflection is measured in volt V , and the deflection sensitivity b converts it from volt to meters . Review Trends in Biotechnology xxx xxxx , Vol . xxx , No . x TIBTEC - 1164 ; No . of Pages 8 2 has made the AFM indenter a valuable diagnostic tool for determining whether biopsies are benign or malignant [ 51 ] . Taking advantage of the opposite approach ( i . e . , a cell pushing against a cantilever ) , the equilibrium between the outward force of osmotic pressure and the inward force of the actomyosin cortex was investigated during cell mitosis [ 52 ] . The low temporal resolution ( a few seconds per curve , resulting in several minutes for mapping ) could be improved by a factor of 10 – 10 , 000 via dynamic AFM analysis of the harmonics of a vibrating cantilever , as recently demonstrated with Escherichia coli , rat ﬁbro - blasts , and human red blood cells [ 53 ] . Cell surgery Introducing a probe inside a cell opens the possibility to either extract cellular material for analysis or perturb the cell by delivering exogenous substances , such as functional proteins , peptides , nucleic acids , drugs , nanoparticles , or even organelles . AFM tips can be partially inserted into cells by forward force spectroscopy , indenting the cell until the cell membrane ruptures . The precise force feedback together with the nanosized tip apex allows for a controlled puncturing of the cell membrane and minimal cell damage , coupled with a valuable readout of perforation events , which is not possible via injection using standard glass micropipettes . Initially , conventional AFM tips were inserted into living mammalian cells to extract mRNA that passively adsorbed onto the tip walls [ 54 ] . Later , coating the tip with a platinum layer enabled the dielec - trophoretic extraction of mRNA [ 55 ] and active isolation of RNA molecules from breast cancer cells for detection pur - poses [ 56 ] . A similar approach was employed for delivering plasmid DNA that was adsorbed onto the pyramidal walls into a cell [ 57 ] . To reduce cell perturbation by cell punctur - ing , several groups developed AFM probes bearing ultra - sharp nanoneedles [ 58 – 60 ] or carbon nanotubes [ 61 ] . A main limitation of these approaches is that intracellular biomolecule release occurs via spontaneous or chemically activated desorption from the probe surface , which cannot be controlled and is not suited for every molecule . Although sharp AFM tips have been successfully inserted inside bacterial cells without affecting their viability [ 62 ] , to our knowledge , AFM extraction and injection have not been reported for bacteria or yeasts because of their chal - lenging size and wall hardness . Development of ﬂuidic force microscopy ( FluidFM ) The desire to actively deliver precise amounts of biomole - cules through nanosized probes that minimize cell pertur - bation fostered the development of novel AFM - based strategies to dispense liquids , as well as alternative micro - ﬂuidic probes without force control ( Box 1 ) . The major hurdle in handling femtoliter volumes of a solution in a liquid environment with force control was overcome by connecting a microchanneled cantilever to a pressure con - troller via a ﬂuidic circuit , which was achieved in FluidFM [ 9 ] . A macrochannel with a diameter of 0 . 5 mm was drilled in the probe holder of an atomic force microscope , the microchanneled probe ( Figure 2 ) was ﬁxed at one side of the macrochannel , and a pressure controller was connected to the other side of the probe holder . Thus , a watertight pipeline was obtained from the pressure controller to the aperture at the pyramid apex , enabling immersion in liquid ( Figure 3A ) . FluidFM preserves the strength of AFM , meaning that the sensitive AFM force feedback allows for the controlled approach of the pyramidal tip of the microchanneled cantilever to any substrate , ranging from soft living cells to hard inorganic surfaces . FluidFM can also be used for imaging in contact or intermittent contact mode on top of an optical microscope for simulta - neous optical observation . In addition , the ability to apply a pressure allows for negative pressure experiments ( Figure 3B ) involving suction for applications such as cell adhesion , or positive pressure experiments ( Figure 3C ) resulting in controlled dispensing for applications such as cell injection . Volumes down to 0 . 5 fL of a solution containing any soluble agent can be delivered when con - nected to a pressure controller with a current resolution of 2 . 5 Pa and 0 . 1 s . FluidFM and single - cell manipulation Different functionalities of FluidFM have been estab - lished so far for single - cell manipulation ( Figure 4 ) . The Box 1 . Microchanneled cantilevers and alternative strategies for single cell manipulation experiments Over the past decade , microfabrication processes have been perfected for the production of atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) cantilevers with embedded microchannels . This field was pioneered with the nanodispensing ( NADIS ) system [ 73 ] , consisting of a standard AFM cantilever bearing a hollow pyramid with a nanosized aperture at the apex drilled by a focused ion beam ( FIB ) . A microdroplet of solution was placed into the hollow pyramid with the help of a glass micropipette , and after bringing the tip in contact with a substrate , liquid was deposited by capillarity . Subsequently , cantilevers were produced with an incorporated microchannel connecting the hollow pyramidal tip on one side and a macro reservoir on the other side . Such microchannels were obtained either by etching a sacrificial layer between two layers of Si 3 N 4 [ 74 , 75 ] or by thermally bonding two layers [ 76 , 77 ] , or a combination thereof [ 78 ] . With an opened reservoir , all the above mentioned probes are , however , restricted to use in air and to liquid delivery driven by capillarity and diffusion . The proof - of - principle of injecting quantum dots into mammalian cells with the ‘nanofountain probes’ [ 75 ] was also performed in air upon temporary removal of physiological buffer [ 79 ] . Microchanneled cantilevers were con - nected to a pressure control for active liquid handling for the first time in the fluidic force microscopy ( FluidFM ) configuration in 2009 , enabling its full operation in liquid . Recently , two similar solutions [ 80 , 93 ] have been proposed . The nanofountain probes have also been connected to a pressure controller for electroporation experi - ments , but using a micromanipulator instead of an AFM ( i . e . , without force feedback ) [ 81 ] . In addition to microchanneled cantilevers , bent glass pipettes were adapted for AFM experiments [ 82 , 83 ] . Alternatively , scanning ion conductance microscopy using glass nanopipettes with ionic current instead of force as feedback has been employed for local deposition of biomolecules [ 84 ] , dye injection [ 85 ] , and the analysis of cell - extracted samples [ 86 ] . In addition , several free - standing devices have been proposed for single - cell experiments that lack z - feedback during the manipulation and are generally coupled with a micromanipulator . For instance , carbon multiwall nanotubes have been fixed at the aperture of glass pipettes ( cellular endoscope ) for single - cell injection experiments [ 87 ] . Also , several groups developed multifunctional pipettes based on hydrodynamically confined microflow ( reviewed in [ 88 ] ) . These devices allowed exposing single cells to a specific solution , and / or simultaneous aspiration of the cell microenvironment [ 89 – 91 ] .

Review Trends in Biotechnology xxx xxxx , Vol . xxx , No . x TIBTEC - 1164 ; No . of Pages 8 4 applications include the accurate delivery of bioactive compounds to single , targeted cells in physiological medi - um , the precise and gentle displacements of individual eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells , the serial measurements of whole cell adhesion forces , and intracellular injection . Controlled delivery of bioactive agents The ability to deliver a controlled amount of a desired biomolecule to a selected cell under physiological condi - tions is expected to provide new insight into fundamental cellular processes and responses to exogenous substances , including drugs or toxic compounds . Meister et al . [ 9 ] presented the ﬁrst FluidFM - based strategy to dispense selected molecules in solution to a single targeted cell , whereby the microﬂuidic probe was ﬁlled with a mem - brane - permeable ﬂuorescent dye and brought into gentle contact with the cell membrane via force - controlled posi - tioning . The ﬂuorescent molecules selectively diffused into the targeted neuroblastoma cell . More recently , FluidFM was used for the controlled delivery of bioactive molecules in solution by demonstrating the dosage and spatially controlled release of a functional enzyme in solution ( i . e . , trypsin ) [ 63 ] . The microﬂuidic probe was positioned above the targeted cell , and the protease was released under tight pressure tuning . The applied pressure pulse deﬁned not only the volume of solution released but also the area subjected to the solution , allowing local delivery scaled down to the single - cell level . The selective , trypsin - induced detachment of individual HeLa cells from high - density cultures was achieved through the delivery of a few pL volumes [ 63 ] . Aside from biomolecules in solutions , larger particles in suspension were also successfully han - dled using the microﬂuidic probe . Vaccinia viruses ( VACVs ) were suspended in buffer solution and released through the microchanneled probe for deposition onto single , targeted cells . A controlled number of virions , ranging from 1 to 12 , was analyzed to determine their infectivity in individual HeLa cells , and this resulted in the discovery of a cooperative behavior of VACVs during the early stages of infection [ 64 ] . In these examples , ﬂuorescent dyes , enzymes , and viruses were efﬁciently delivered to single cells , but the approach is extendable to virtually any entity small enough to ﬂow through the 1 m m - high channel , offering a versatile and effective means to perturb the microenvironment of single cells under physiological conditions . Spatial manipulation Another modality of FluidFM consists of the spatial ma - nipulation of microsized objects . Here , the targeted entity is captured at the probe aperture by aspiration , trans - ferred in space , and released by overpressure . Both the force and pressure are tightly tunable , enabling the pre - cise , gentle and stable manipulation of the object . In addition , different sizes of the microﬂuidic probe aperture can be used depending on the item to be handled . Thus , FluidFM represents a versatile tool to pick - and - place single living cells for patterning or isolation . The grasping and displacement of living bacteria , typically 1 – 2 m m in diameter and 2 – 5 m m in length , was ﬁrst demonstrated by the relocation of E . coli cells on a solid substrate [ 65 ] . The approach was then used to speciﬁcally isolate bacteria from complex mixtures : here , bacteriophyll - producing bacteria that feature a distinctive emission spectrum in the infrared ﬁeld [ 66 ] . Individual cells were optically chosen and isolated for subsequent growth and identiﬁca - tion by 16S rRNA gene ampliﬁcation and sequencing [ 66 ] . This method was also successfully used to relocate Sac - charomyces cerevisiae cells , spherical yeasts with a diam - eter of about 8 m m [ 65 ] . Very recently , the fully reversible , pressure - mediated cell immobilization transport of living cells was applied to mammalian cells [ 63 ] .

Review Trends in Biotechnology xxx xxxx , Vol . xxx , No . x TIBTEC - 1164 ; No . of Pages 8 5 are more fragile and softer than the previously handled microbial cells , it was possible to capture mammalian cells ( 10 – 20 m m in diameter for detached cells ) at the probe aperture , transport them , and release them in a serial fashion on either a new substrate or into a microwell , thereby preserving cell viability [ 63 ] . Collectively , these results illustrate the spatial manipulation of a broad spectrum of cells in a gentle , precise , effective , and serial fashion . Similar to living cells , microbeads can also be immobi - lized at the probe aperture in a fully reversible manner . This possibility was exploited to provide exchangeable colloidal probes for the serial measurement of cell adhe - sion and cell elasticity [ 67 ] . Because it enables the rapid replacement of the colloid through the simple expulsion and sucking of a new one , this new approach offers an attractive alternative to conventional colloidal probe AFM [ 68 , 69 ] . Adhesion As described above , individual cells and colloids can be immobilized at the aperture of a microﬂuidic probe under pressure control . Because conventional SCFS is limited by chemical cell attachment to the cantilever , pressure - medi - ated cell immobilization represents a promising opportu - nity for fast , stable , and reversible cell ﬁxation . Thus , a novel approach for SCFS was developed in which the probe is ﬁrst brought in gentle contact with the target cell , underpressure is applied to reversibly ﬁx the cell to the cantilever , and the microﬂuidic probe is lifted to pull the cell away from its substrate while the detachment force curves are recorded [ 70 ] ( Figure 3B ) . Using this technique , force – distance curves were acquired for different yeasts while detaching from synthetic substrates . The fast immo - bilization process combined with the ability to release the cell using a short overpressure pulse after measurement allowed for the serial measurement of approximately 200 yeast cells with the same probe , which is in sharp contrast to the capabilities of conventional SCFS ( one cell per cantilever ) . Furthermore , FluidFM allows ample time for cells to adhere to their respective substrate prior to cell approach and immediately following force measurements , a requi - site for dynamic adhesion studies . The latter was illustrat - ed by following the temperature - and development - dependent dynamic changes in the cell wall properties of Candida albicans [ 70 ] . Another signiﬁcant advantage of this pressure - based immobilization strategy is the high immobilization force , which largely overcomes the forces obtained with conventional chemical cell trapping , allow - ing for the measurement of whole - cell adhesion of spread mammalian cells [ 70 , 71 ] . Applying this protocol in a follow - up study allowed the recording of adhesion forces con - nected to the focal adhesion maturation as a function of the underlying substrate topography , which is of rele - vance , for example , during endothelialization [ 71 ] . Overall , these studies enabled the measurement of adhesion forces for different microbial and mammalian cell types ranging from 500 pN to 1 . 6 m N . Current efforts are focused on expanding the approach to the measurement of bacterial cell adhesion . Injection In the applications described above , the microﬂuidic probe is gently and precisely positioned at a deﬁned distance above a target cell or in soft contact with it . As mentioned previously , pyramidal AFM tips can be inserted inside a cell , which is achieved during forward force spectroscopy . The latter allows membrane rupture , which is detected as distinct force relaxation peaks in the indentation curve . Once inserted , the tip can be maintained inside the cell and biomolecules of interest can be injected into the cell by overpressure ( Figure 3C ) . In an initial study , the pyrami - dal microchanneled probe was used to deliver a membrane impermeable ﬂuorescent dye into the cytosol of myoblasts and neuroblastoma cells [ 9 , 72 ] . Later , this single - cell in - jection approach was extended to intranuclear injection , whereby the probe was inserted through the cytoplasmic membrane and the nuclear envelope to reach the nucleus of HeLa cells [ 9 , 72 ] . Volumes up to 800 fL ( (cid:2) 20 % of the cell volume ) were injected without noticeable changes in cell morphology , while preserving cell viability . Taking advan - tage of the quantitative nature of the injection , deﬁned numbers of functional plasmid DNA were delivered direct - ly into the cell nucleus , resulting in the subsequent tran - sient expression of an encoded green ﬂuorescent protein . The ability to deliver precise amounts of functional biomo - lecules directly into the cytosol or nucleus with minimal cell damage offers great opportunities in various areas of basic and applied research , including stem cell research , to effectively manipulate cells by injecting exogenous materi - als such as DNA , RNA , or protein . Current efforts focus on extending intracellular injection to eukaryotic microorgan - isms , which not only are smaller than mammalian cells but also present a hard cell wall that is resistant to high internal turgor pressure . Concluding remarks and future perspectives Since the invention of AFM more than 30 years ago , the technology has maintained its power as an imaging tool ; however , AFM - based approaches are continuously being developed to allow force - controlled manipulation of single cells under optical inspection . This review highlights the introduction of FluidFM as a force - and pressure - controlled nanopipette in 2009 and the technological advances that followed to provide proof - of - concepts for spatial manipulation , adhesion , and injection together with ﬁrst applications to address biological questions . Further optimization of the FluidFM set - up is anticipated , including the microfabrication of pyramidal probes with optimized openings . FluidFM also holds great promise for single - cell extraction experiments , as well as for the ad - aptation to electrophysiology experiments , such as patch - clamp and scanning ion conductance microscopy measure - ments , by combining force and ion current as feedback signals ( Figure 5 ) . The different operation modes of FluidFM can be combined to perform sequential manip - ulations on a single cell . An example of this was recently reported , whereby a unique probe was employed for both local ﬂuid delivery and spatial manipulation [ 63 ] . Addi - tionally , the ability to recover the cell after manipulation by FluidFM offers the opportunity to combine upstream manipulation with downstream ‘omics’ analyses . Finally , Review Trends in Biotechnology xxx xxxx , Vol . xxx , No . x TIBTEC - 1164 ; No . of Pages 8 6 because all operations performed by the FluidFM are remote - controlled , the instrument holds the potential for automation of serial measurements , thereby further increasing experimental throughput . FluidFM is a versa - tile tool that offers broad applications for single - cell per - turbation and analysis experiments that are of particular interest in the fast developing ﬁelds of systems and syn - thetic biology by stimulating the generation of new hy - potheses and testing them .
