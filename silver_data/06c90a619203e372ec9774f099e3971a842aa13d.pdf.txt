The importance of ECM remodeling to cancer is appreciated ; the rele - vance of stiffening is less clear . We found that breast tumorigenesis is accompanied by collagen cross - linking , ECM stiffening , and increased focal adhe - sions . Induction of collagen crosslinking stiffened the ECM , promoted focal adhesions , enhanced PI3 kinase ( PI3K ) activity , and induced the invasion of an oncogene - initiated epithelium . Inhibition of integ - rin signaling repressed the invasion of a premalignant epithelium into a stiffened , crosslinked ECM and forced integrin clustering promoted focal adhesions , enhanced PI3K signaling , and induced the invasion of a premalignant epithelium . Consistently , reduction of lysyl oxidase - mediated collagen crosslinking pre - vented MMTV - Neu - induced ﬁbrosis , decreased focal adhesions and PI3K activity , impeded malignancy , and lowered tumor incidence . These data show how collagen crosslinking can modulate tissue ﬁbrosis and stiffness to force focal adhesions , growth factor signaling and breast malignancy . INTRODUCTION The tumor stroma is characterized by extracellular matrix ( ECM ) remodelingandstiffening , andtissuestiffnesshasbeenexploited to detect cancer ( Butcher et al . , 2009 ; Sinkus et al . , 2000 ) . ECM stiffness enhances cell growth and survival and promotes migra - tion ( Loetal . , 2000 ) , andECMrigiditydisruptstissuemorphogen - esis by increasing cell tension ( Paszek et al . , 2005 ) . Reduction of cell tension repressed the malignant behavior of mammary epithelial cells ( MECs ) and normalized the behavior of breast cancercellsinculture ( Paszeketal . , 2005 ) . WhatdrivesECMstiff - ening in tumors and whether ECM tension could drive tumor progression has yet to be determined . Collagen is the most abundant ECM scaffolding protein in the stroma and contributes signiﬁcantly to the tensile strength of tissue ( Kolacna et al . , 2007 ) . Collagen metabolism is deregulated in cancer , where increased collagen expression , elevated depo - sition , altered organization , and enhanced matrix metalloprotei - nase ( MMP ) activity and collagen turnover have been implicated in tumor progression ( Jodele et al . , 2006 ) . MMP - mediated collagen remodeling can create space for cells to migrate , produce substrate cleavage fragments with independent biolog - ical activity , modify adhesion to regulate tissue architecture , and activate , deactivate , or alter the activity of signaling molecules ( Page - McCaw et al . , 2007 ) . Although high levels of MMPs corre - late with poor prognosis in cancer patients ( Tetu et al . , 2006 ) and modulation of MMP activity changes tumor phenotype ( Zhang et al . , 2008 ) , MMP inhibitors failed clinically ( Coussens et al . , 2002 ) , indicating other ECM remodeling parameters regulate malignancy . Type I collagen is considered a structural barrier against tumor invasion , but paradoxically , increased expression of collagen is associated with elevated incidence of metastasis ( Ramaswamy et al . , 2003 ) . Indeed , mammographic density , which is charac - terized by higher collagen I , increases breast cancer risk ( Martin Cell 139 , 891 – 906 , November 25 , 2009 ª 2009 Elsevier Inc . 891 A C E G H F D B 892 Cell 139 , 891 – 906 , November 25 , 2009 ª 2009 Elsevier Inc . and Boyd , 2008 ) . Importantly , collagen crosslinking accom - panies tissue ﬁbrosis ( van der Slot et al . , 2005 ) , and ﬁbrosis increases risk of malignancy ( Colpaert et al . , 2003 ) . Lysyl oxidase ( LOX ) , a copper - dependent amine oxidase ( Kagan and Li , 2003 ) that initiates the process of covalent intra - and intermolecular crosslinking of collagen by oxidatively deaminating speciﬁc lysine and hydroxylysine residues located in the telopeptide domains ( Yamauchi and Shiiba , 2008 ) , is frequently elevated in tumors ( Erler et al . , 2009 ) . Active LOX stiffens tissues and can compromise their function ( Pfeiffer et al . , 2005 ) , and reduction of LOX activity tempers tissue stiffness and prevents ﬁbrosis ( Georges et al . , 2007 ) . Nevertheless , the relationship between collagen crosslinking , tissue ﬁbrosis and tension , and cancer has yet to be assessed . Integrins transduce cues from the ECM by assembling adhe - sion plaque complexes that initiate biochemical signaling and stimulate cytoskeletal remodeling to regulate cell behavior ( Miranti and Brugge , 2002 ) . Force increases integrin expression , activity , and focal adhesions ( Paszek et al . , 2005 ; Sawada et al . , 2006 ) . Human breast tumors are often ﬁbrotic and stiff , and breast cancer cells that exhibit high tension have elevated integ - rins and focal adhesions and increased integrin signaling ( Madan et al . , 2006 ; Mitra and Schlaepfer , 2006 ) . Thus , ECM stiffness could regulate malignancy by enhancing integrin - dependent mechanotransduction . Consistently , breast malignancy can be inhibited by genetically ablating integrin expression ( White et al . , 2004 ) , and breast cancer cell behavior can be repressed by inhi - bition of integrin activity or reduction of cell tension ( Paszek et al . , 2005 ) . Likewise , knockdown of the expression or inhibition of the function of focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) or p130 Cas , two integrin adhesion plaque proteins , impedes breast tumor progression ( Cabodi et al . , 2006 ; Lahlou et al . , 2007 ) . Here , we asked whether collagen crosslinking could stiffen the ECM and induce ﬁbrosis to promote breast malignancy by altering integrins and whether inhibition of collagen crosslinking could prevent ﬁbrosis and impede breast tumorigenesis by reducing integrin signaling . RESULTS ECM Stiffening and Collagen Crosslinking Accompany Breast Tumor Progression The HER2 gene is a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) family that is ampliﬁed in 20 % – 25 % of human breast cancers . The rat equivalent of HER2 is the wild - type Neu transgene , which , under the MMTV promoter ( MMTV - Neu ) , develops breast tumors with a long latency ( Kim and Muller , 1999 ) . Using the MMTV - Neu model , we studied the rela - tionship between tissue ﬁbrosis , stiffness , and cancer . Uncon - ﬁned compression and rheological testing showed an incre - mental stiffening of the mammary gland as it transitioned from normal to premalignant to invasive cancer ( Figures 1A – 1C , top ) and demonstrated that the stromal tissue adjacent to the invading epithelium was also substantially stiffer than normal . Total levels ( Figure S1 available online ) and amount of ﬁbrillar collagen increased markedly ( Figures 1C and 1D ) , and second harmonics generation ( SHG ) imaging revealed the progressive linearization of the collagen adjacent to the developing epithelial lesions ( Figures 1E and 1F ) . Wenextexploredwhethercollagencrosslinkingcouldaccount for the dramatic ECM remodeling and stiffening . We noted an increase in the levels of the major reducible bifunctional collagen crosslinks , dehydrodihydroxylysinonorleucine ( DHLNL ) , and hy - droxylysinonorleucine ( HLNL ) in the breast tumors , reﬂecting elevated crosslinked collagen ( Figure 1G ) . We further detected increased amounts of the amine oxidase crosslinking enzyme , LOX , inthestromalcellsofthepremalignantMinfociandinvasive tumors and in the invading transformed epithelium ( Figure 1H ) . These data establish an association between collagen cross - linking , LOX expression , ECM stiffness , and tissue ﬁbrosis in Neu - induced breast tumorigenesis . LOX - Mediated Collagen Crosslinking and Tissue Stiffening Promote Focal Adhesions and Tumor Progression In Vivo We next asked whether LOX - mediated collagen crosslinking could stiffen the breast and promote invasion of a premalignant lesion . We used Ha - ras human MCF10AT MECs which upon injection into mice develop into premalignant tissues ( Hu et al . , 2008 ) . We conditioned inguinal mammary fat pads of NOD / SCID mice , surgically cleared of their epithelium , with control ﬁbroblasts or those expressing elevated LOX ( Figures 2A , S2 , and S3 ) . Rheological measurement revealed that the mammary glands conditioned with LOX expressing ﬁbroblasts were stiffer ( Figure 2B ) , picrosirius red staining showed that they had more ﬁbrillar collagen ( Figures 2C and 2D ) , and SHG imaging revealed that they had more linearized collagen ( Figures 2C and 2E ) . Consistent with ECM stiffening , resident ﬁbroblasts in the epithe - lial - cleared LOX - treated glands showed more FAK pY397 and p130 Cas immunostaining , indicative of increased focal adhesions and mechanosignaling in the stromal cells ( Figure 2C , bottom ) . LOX preconditioning and stiffening of the mammary gland promoted the growth and invasion of Ha - ras premalignant Figure 1 .

MECs in the LOX preconditioned glands also had more focal adhesions , as revealed by elevated FAK pY397 ( Figure 2H ) and p130 Cas ( data not shown ) . To rule out any direct effect of LOX activity on MEC behavior , we also treated a cohort of animals in parallel ( i . e . , at time of MEC injec - tion ) with b - aminopropionitrile ( BAPN ) , a natural and irreversible inhibitor of lysyl oxidase activity ( Kagan and Li , 2003 ) . Because BAPN treatment had no effect on tumor growth , invasion , and focal adhesions ( Figures S4 – S6 ) , we concluded that it was LOX preconditioning of the stroma and ECM stiffness that promoted mammary tumor progression , and not any direct effect of LOX on the mammary epithelium . These ﬁndings demonstrate how ECM crosslinking and stiffening can induce focal adhesions and promote the growth and invasion of an oncogene - initiated mammary epithelium in vivo . Inhibition of LOX - Mediated Collagen Crosslinking Decreases Fibrosis and Reduces Focal Adhesions to Inhibit Breast Tumor Progression In Vivo We next asked whether reduction of LOX - dependent collagen crosslinking could temper tissue ﬁbrosis and decrease focal adhesions , and whether this would inhibit breast tumor progres - sion . We inhibited LOX activity using the cell - soluble BAPN ( Lucero and Kagan , 2006 ) or a LOX - speciﬁc function - blocking polyclonal antibody that only inhibits extracellular LOX activity ( Erler et al . , 2006 ) and assayed collagen crosslinking , tissue ﬁbrosis , focal adhesions , and breast tumor development . Inhibition of LOX activity was initiated in ﬁve month old parous animals , when LOX levels were already increased in the stromal cells but were non - detectable in the mammary epithelium ( Figure 1H ) . Treatment was continued for 1 month , after which the animals were allowed to recover for another month and then sacriﬁced ( Figure 3A ) . At the time of sacriﬁce , the non - treated MMTV - Neu mice had high levels of active LOX in the serum , whereas BAPN or LOX - inhibitory polyclonal antibody - treated animals had reduced levels ( Figure 3B ) . Mice with reduced LOX activity showed signiﬁcant decreases in LOX - mediated collagen crosslinks , both reducible ( DHLNL and HLNL ) and nonreducible ( pyridinoline ) ( Figures 3C and 3D ) , and the collagen ﬁbrils adjacent to the epithelial lesions were less linear ( Figures 3E and 3F ) . Consistent with the possibility that inhibition of collagen crosslinking prevented tissue ﬁbrosis , LOX inhibition reduced ﬁbrillar collagen ( Figures 3G and 3H ) and had less focal adhesions , as indicated by negligible FAK pY397 ( Figure 3I ) . Inhibition of LOX activity also increased tumor latency ( Figure 4A ) and decreased tumor incidence ( Figure 4B ) , despite ErbB2 activity ( Figure 4C ) . Moreover , the palpable lesions formed in the LOX - inhibited animals were smaller ( Figure 4D ) and less proliferative ( Figure 4E ) . LOX - inhibited mammary glands also stained positively for cytokeratin 14 along the basal periphery of the ducts , implying retention of their myoepithelium ( Figures 4H and 4I ) . Hematoxylin and eosin ( H & E ) sections revealed that a signiﬁcantly greater proportion of the lesions in the LOX - inhibited animals were hyperplastic or premalignant ( hyperplastic alveolar nodules [ HANs ] or mammary intraepithelial neoplasias [ MINs ] ) and the tumors that did develop were mostly low grade as opposed to the high grade carcinomas typically observed in the untreated Neu mice ( Figures 4G and 4F ) . These results show how inhibition of LOX activity reduces collagen crosslinking , tempers tissue ﬁbrosis , decreases focal adhesions , and impedes tumor progression to reduce breast tumor incidence . Collagen Crosslinking and ECM Stiffening Promote Focal Adhesions and Drive Invasion of Oncogenically Initiated Mammary Tissues in Culture We next assessed the effect of nonspeciﬁc induction of collagen crosslinking and stiffening on MEC invasion in the absence of ﬁbroblasts , immune cells , and other stromal and systemic cellular and soluble factors ( Figure 5A , experimental design ) . We explored the effect of nonspeciﬁc collagen crosslinking and stiffening on tumor invasion by adding ribose to the media of nonmalignant , MCF10A acini embedded in a 3D soft collagen I / reconstituted basement membrane gel ( Col / rBM gel ) . To determine whether MEC invasion required oncogenic signaling , we utilized MCF10As expressing an ErbB2 chimera ( ErbB2 . chim ; called HER - 2 ; the human homolog of Neu ) con - sisting of the extracellular and transmembrane domains of low - afﬁnity nerve growth factor receptor ( p75NGFR ) , and the cytoplasmic kinase domain of ErbB2 linked to the synthetic ligand - binding domain from the FK506 - binding protein ( FKBP ) . In these MECs , addition of the synthetic bivalent FKBP ligand , AP1510 , drives homodimerization of ErbB2 , activation of the kinase domain , and initiation of ErbB2 signaling ( Muthuswamy et al . , 2001 ) . Chimeric ErbB2 signaling drives proliferation and luminal ﬁlling but fails to induce MEC invasion in rBM ( Figure 5E ) . To study effects of homo - ( ErbB2 / ErbB2 ) and heterodimer ( ErbB1 / ErbB2 ) formation , we also engineered MECs in which the wild - type ErbB2 could be overexpressed through addition of doxycycline ( ErbB2 . TetOn ; Figures S7 and S8 ) . In the absence of ErbB2 activity , MECs in collagen / rBM gels assembled acini , as illustrated by basally oriented b 4 integrin and cell - cell localized beta catenin ( Figure 5E ) . Glycation - medi - ated crosslinking stiffened the collagen ( Figure 5B ) , increased colony size ( Figure 5C ) , and disrupted tissue organization , as revealed by diffusely localized beta catenin and the appearance of random cells within the lumens ( Figure 5E ) . MECs within the ribose crosslinked collagen gels also had elevated levels and co - localized b 1 integrin and FAK pY397 , indicative of tension - induced ( F ) Rheology of mammary glands with injected Ha - ras MCF10AT MECs .

Nevertheless , in the absence of ErbB2 activity , ECM stiffening did not drive MEC invasion ( Figures 5E and 5F ) . Addition of either AP1510 ( 1 m M ) or doxycycline ( 0 . 2 m g / mL ) to the mammary acini , induced and activated ( ErbB2 . TetOn ) or directly activated ErbB2 ( ErbB2 . chim ) ( Figure S9 ) , promoted cell growth ( data not shown ) , drove luminal ﬁlling , and destabi - lized cell - cell junctions , as revealed by diffusely localized beta catenin ( Figure 5E ) . Sustained ErbB2 activation did not drive MEC invasion , as indicated by colony integrity and the retention of basally localized b 4 integrin ( Muthuswamy et al . , 2001 ) ( Figures 5E and 5F ) . Yet , when ErbB2 was activated in colonies in the crosslinked , stiffened gels , colony architecture disinte - grated , as revealed by the absence of detectable beta catenin and disorganized b 4 integrin staining , and MECs invaded into the gels ( Figure 5E , white arrows ; quantiﬁed in Figure 5F ) . SHG imaging revealed that individually , ErbB2 activation and ECM stiffening were accompanied by the appearance of prominent collagen bundles surrounding the colonies and showed that MECs with activated ErbB2 invaded on ﬁbrils that extended perpendicularly into the crosslinked , stiffened gels ( Figurs 5E , white arrows highlight an invasive MEC , yellow arrows indicate collagen reorganization ; Figure S9 ) . These ﬁndings show how collagen crosslinking and ECM stiffening , per se , cooperate with oncogenes such as ErbB2 to promote the invasive behavior of a mammary epithelium . Interestingly , confocal imaging revealed elevated p130 Cas and FAK pY397 staining that colocalized with b 1 integrin ( colocalization analysis of FAK pY397 and b 1 integrin ; Pearson’s r = 0 . 78 ; p130 Cas and b 1 integrin , Pearson’s r = 0 . 89 ) in the stiffer breast tissue of the Neu mice ( Figure 6A ; see insert ) and reduced levels of FAK pY397 after LOX inhibition ( Figure 3H ) . Moreover , inhibition of b 1 integrin activity , with the function blocking antibody AIIB2 , or reduction of integrin signaling by expression of an inducible FRNK ( FRNK . TetOn ; Figure S10 ) prevented the force - mediated invasion of the ErbB2 activated mammary organoids ( Figures 5G and 5H ) . These ﬁndings show how ECM crosslinking and stiffness cooperate with an oncogene to promote breast cell invasion and implicateintegrinsignalinginforce - dependenttumorprogression . Integrin Clustering Promotes Focal Adhesions to Drive Invasion of a Ha - ras Mammary Epithelium In Vitro and In Vivo To determine whether integrin signaling would be sufﬁcient to induce breast tumor invasion , we expressed a series of integrin constructs in nonmalignant MCF10A and Ha - ras premalignant MCF10AT MECs and assayed for invasive behavior in rBM and in vivo ( Figure 6B ) . Expression of the V737N integrin , which recapitulates tension - dependent integrin clustering , promoted focal adhesions , indi - cated by elevated FAK pY397 ( Figure 6C ) , and disrupted the integrity of mammary colonies in rBM , revealed by luminal ﬁlling and altered b 4 integrin localization ( Figure 6C , top ) . In contrast , expression of neither a wild - type ( Figure 6C ) nor a constitutively active b 1 integrin ( not shown ; Paszek et al . [ 2005 ] ) induced focal adhesions and disrupted mammary tissue architecture . More - over , while the V737N b 1 integrin mutant failed to promote inva - sion of the MCF10A MECs ( Figure 6C ) , the V737N integrin induced the invasion of the Ha - ras premalignant MCF10AT colo - nies in rBM ( Figures 6D and 6E ) . Upon injection into nude mice , the V737N integrin not only promoted focal adhesions and increased lesion size ( Figure 6F ) , but also induced the invasive behavior of the Ha - ras MCF10AT organoids , as revealed by the loss of epithelial lesion margins and increased FAK pY397 ( see arrows in Figure 6G ) . These ﬁndings implicate tension - dependent integrin clustering and focal adhesions in breast tumor invasion . However , because integrin clustering could only promote invasion in Ha - ras premalignant MECs , they also illustrate how integrin - mediated mechanotransduction cooper - ates with oncogenic signaling to drive malignancy . Collagen Crosslinking and Tissue Stiffness Promote Integrin Clustering and Enhance PI3K Signaling to Regulate Invasion of a Premalignant Mammary Epithelium In Vitro and Tumor Progression In Vivo Integrins activate PI3K , and PI3K promotes invasion in culture and tumor progression in vivo ( Webster et al . , 1998 ) . Therefore , we explored the relationship between focal adhesions and PI3K signaling in tension - dependent breast tumor invasion . We found Akt signaling , an established target of PI3K , to be elevated in the premalignant and malignant , rigid mammary tissue ( Figure 7A ) and in the mammary colonies in the ribose - stiffened collagen gels ( Figure 7B ) . We examined the effect of ECM rigidity on PI3K activity in MECs plated on rBM - functionalized polyacrylamide gels ( rBM PA gel ) with elastic moduli of 140 – 400 ( soft ) and R 5000 – 10 , 000 ( stiff ) Pascals . These two extremes represent the ECM stiffness of healthy versus transformed breast tissue . Although substrate stiffness did not increase the levels of Akt pS473 in unsti - mulated MECs , ECM stiffness potentiated the magnitude of EGF - activated Akt pS473 ( Figure 7C ) and increased ErbB2 - acti - vated Akt pS473 ( Figure 7D ) . MECs on soft gels that expressed the b 1 integrin cluster mutant , but not the wild - type b 1 integrin , also showed a signiﬁcant increase in Akt pS473 activity after EGF stimulation . These results suggest that integrin mechano - transduction potentiates growth factor dependent PI3 kinase signaling ( Figures 6B , 6C , and 7E ) . Pharmacological inhibition of PI3K activity with LY294002 restoredthecolonyarchitectureofErbB2 - activatedMECsinribose crosslinked collagen gels toward that of a noninvasive , polarized , cohesive colony ( Figures 7F and 7G ) . Inhibition of PI3K activity reduced colony size , and immunostaining revealed that colonies treated with LY294002 retained b catenin at cell - cell junctions and had basally localized b 4 integrin ( Figure 7F ) . The epithelium from the LOX - inhibited Neu mice also had lower PI3K signaling , asrevealedbyfainteractiveAkt / PI3Ksubstratestaining ( Figure7H ) . These data are consistent with a role for integrin mechanotrans - duction in PI3K - mediated breast tumor invasion . The ﬁndings suggestthatECMstiffness , asinducedbyelevatedcollagencross - linking could promote breast malignancy by enhancing integrin - GFR crosstalk ( Figure 7I ) ( Miranti and Brugge , 2002 ) .

The observations are consistent with links between ECM crosslinking and tissue stiffening in tissue ﬁbrosis and could explain the increased risk to malignancy associated with these conditions ( Colpaert et al . , 2003 ) . They might also explain why women with mammographically dense breasts have an increased relative risk of developing cancer ( Martin and Boyd , 2008 ) . Because aged tissues are stiffer and contain high levels of aberrant collagen crosslinks , the data offer a new paradigm for understanding why tumor incidence increases so dramati - cally with aging ( Szauter et al . , 2005 ) . Tissue ﬁbrosis inﬂuences tumor progression by regulating soluble factors that induce inﬂammation and angiogenesis and stimulate cell growth and invasion ( Bierie et al . , 2009 ; Coussens et al . , 1999 ) . We showed that modiﬁcation of the state of collagen crosslinking and ECM stiffness , two physical parameters of the tissue microenvironment , modulated the invasive behavior of an oncogene pre transformed mammary epithelium , even in the absence of cellular and soluble tissue and systemic factors . The ﬁndings imply that tissue ﬁbrosis could regulate cancer behavior by inﬂuencing the biophysical properties of the micro - environment to alter force at the cell and / or tissue level . Impor - tantly , we noted that focal adhesions were elevated in the stiffened breast tumors and organoid cultures , that forcing focal adhesions promoted MEC invasion , and that inhibiting focal adhesion signaling or tempering tissue stiffening reduced focal adhesions and tumor invasion . These observations are consis - tent with the notion that force regulates the invasive behavior of tumors by modulating integrin activity and focal adhesion assembly and signaling ( Paszek et al . , 2005 ) . The ﬁndings thereby provide an explanation for why pY FAK and p130 Cas are so often increased in breast tumors ( Cabodi et al . , 2006 ; Madan et al . , 2006 ) , even when integrin expression is frequently decreased ( Koukoulis et al . , 1993 ; Zutter et al . , 1998 ) . Indeed , the observations suggest that enhanced integrin signaling rather than just an increase in integrin expression is more critical for tumor progression . Our data show how modulating the activity of one class of ECM crosslinking enzymes , the LOXs , can directly modify tumor progression by regulating collagen crosslinking and stiffness . The results are consistent with data indicating that LOX enzymes are elevated in many cancers ( Erler and Weaver , 2009 ) and that LOX is induced by hypoxia inducible factor ( HIF - 1 ) and TGF b , two key regulators of tumor behavior ( Postovit et al . , 2008 ) . Indeed , cellular LOX promotes breast cell migration and invasion and enhances tumor proliferation and survival ( Kirschmann et al . , 2002 ) . Hypoxia - induced LOX modulates tumor metastasis by regulating integrin function ( Erler and Giaccia , 2006 ) by facilitating tumor extravasation ( Bondareva et al . , 2009 ) or by conditioning the metastatic niche ( Erler et al . , 2009 ) . Our work indicates that LOX can promote tumor progression and MEC invasion by increasing ﬁbrillar collagen and ECM stiffness . These observations are consistent with the major function of LOX in tissues as a key enzyme for collagen and elastin crosslinking that enhances tensile strength ( Szauter et al . , 2005 ) . Consis - tently , by inhibiting LOX activity early , when levels were high in the stroma , we prevented ECM remodeling and stiffening and reduced tumor progression in the MMTV - Neu mice . Because a LOX - speciﬁc inhibitory polyclonal that cannot inhibit intracel - lular LOX also prevented ﬁbrosis and tumor progression , our results suggest that LOX - mediated collagen crosslinking likely regulates breast tumor progression by modifying the tumor microenvironment rather than by directly changing cell behavior . We observed that LOX inhibition reduced focal adhesions and PI3K signaling indicating that LOX modulates breast tumor progression by stiffening the ECM to drive focal adhesions assembly and enhance GFR - dependent PI3K signaling . Consis - tently , we showed that ribose - mediated collagen crosslinking , which induces nonspeciﬁc collagen glycation , also stiffened the ECM and enhanced focal adhesions and PI3K signaling to promote ErbB2 - dependent breast tumor invasion . We noted that MEC invasion could be abrogated by inhibition of integrin and FAK activity , thereby illustrating the importance of ECM crosslink - ing and stiffness in tumor progression . This idea is consistent with our recent ﬁndings that LOX conditioning of the lung ECM promotes breast tumor metastasis ( Erler et al . , 2009 ) and data showing that ﬁbrotic breast tumors have the poorest prognosis and highest rate of recurrence ( Hasebe et al . , 1997 ) . Indeed , our ﬁndings underscore the notion that ECM crosslinking and stiff - ness , per se , is a key regulator of tumor progression . They imply that other ECM crosslinkers / modulators implicated in tissue ﬁbrosis such as tissue transglutaminase , lysyl hydroxylase or some of the proteoglycans or even non - speciﬁc metabolic glyca - tionendproducts ( AGEs ) mightalsosimilarlypromotemalignancy . LOX has been proposed to be a tumor suppressor ( Payne et al . , 2007 ) possibly by directly inhibiting ECM adhesions and integrin signaling ( Zhao et al . , 2008 ) . LOX - mediated ECM stiff - ening could also impede cell invasion in the absence of MMP activity ( Zaman et al . , 2006 ) reminiscent of highly crosslinked , stiff ﬁbrotic tissues and scars that often never progress to malig - nancy . We noted that neither ECM stiffness nor forced integrin clustering induced mammary tissue invasion in the absence of oncogenic signaling . This suggests that other factors that modu - late integrins and / or ECM remodeling or cellular tension likely cooperate with ECM crosslinking and force to promote tumor invasion ( Katz et al . , 2007 ; Wolf et al . , 2007 ) . Instead , ECM stiff - ness appears to operate as a signaling rheostat potentiating oncogenic cues to promote tumor invasion . Cancer progression is accompanied by MMP - dependent ECM remodeling . Multiple MMPs are overexpressed in the tumor stroma , and some MMPs are upregulated in transformed epithelia ( Jodele et al . , 2006 ; Page - McCaw et al . , 2007 ) . Elevated expression of speciﬁc MMPs induced desmoplasia and malig - nant transformation ( Sternlicht et al . , 1999 ) and genetic ablation of MMPs or pharmaceutical inhibition of MMP activity reduced breast metastasis ( Martin et al . , 2008 ) . These data argue that MMPs are critical for malignancy . Nevertheless , clinical trials with MMPs failed , suggesting that the role of MMPs in cancer ( H ) Confocal images of breast tissue stained for cytokeratin 14 ( red ) and DAPI ( nuclei , blue ) in control and LOX - inhibited tissue .

Indeed , MMPs collaborate with crosslinking enzymes such as LOX to facilitate collagen maturation , and MMPs and LOX regulate the expres - sion and activity of soluble factors such as transforming growth factor beta ( TGF b ) that regulate tumor cell behavior ( Atsawasu - wan et al . , 2008 ; Csiszar , 2001 ; Decitre et al . , 1998 ; Szauter et al . , 2005 ) . TGF b in turn regulates the expression of many ECM proteins and modifying enzymes including LOXs , and TGF b increases levels of factors that evoke inﬂammation , induce ﬁbrosis and promote metastasis ( Bierie and Moses , 2006 ; Oleg - gini et al . , 2007 ) . Indeed , force itself modulates TGF b activation and compression alters growth factor signaling ( Tschumperlin et al . , 2004 ; Wipff et al . , 2007 ) . These ﬁndings underscore the dynamic and reciprocal relationship between ECM deposition , processing , degradation , and force . They suggest that cancer is best viewed as a dynamic , phenotypically plastic , and highly coordinated tissue remodeling process that is tightly regulated by biochemical and mechanical cues . Accordingly , not only will we need to clarify the role of ECM cleavage in tumors but we will also be obliged to understand how ECM remodeling is inte - grated within the context of its deposition , posttranslational modiﬁcations , and topological rearrangement and to take into consideration the effect of mechanical force as a key regulator of malignancy .
