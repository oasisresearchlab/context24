Copyright 0 1989 by the Genetics Society of America A System of Shuttle Vectors and Yeast Host Strains Designed for Efficient Manipulation of DNA in Saccharomyces ceratisiae Robert S . Sikorski and Philip Hieter Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics , Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine , Baltimore , Maryland 21205 Manuscript received October 10 , 1988 Accepted for publication January 25 , 1989 ABSTRACT A series of yeast shuttle vectors and host strains has been created to allow more efficient manipu - lation of DNA in Saccharomyces cereuisiae . Transplacement vectors were constructed and used to derive yeast strains containing nonreverting his3 , trpl , leu2 and ura3 mutations . A set of YCp and YIP vectors ( pRS series ) was then made based on the backbone of the multipurpose plasmid pBLUESCRIPT . These pRS vectors are all uniform in structure and differ only in the yeast selectable marker gene used ( HZS3 , TRPl , LEU2 and URA3 ) . They possess all of the attributes of pBLUESCRIPT and several yeast - specific features as well . Using a pRS vector , one can perform most standard DNA manipulations in the same plasmid that is introduced into yeast . P LASMID cloning vectors that can “shuttle” DNA between yeast and bacteria are fundamental tools in the molecular genetic analysis of Saccharomyces cere - visiae . They are used extensively to manipulate cloned yeast genes and to define cis - acting DNA elements such as promoters and autonomously replicating se - quences . Of the several types of shuttle vectors that have been created ( PARENT , FENIMORE and BOSTIAN 1985 ) , the Yeast Integrating Plasmid ( YIP ) and Yeast Centromere Plasmid ( YCp ) types seem to have the most general applicability . However , despite their broad utility and routine usage , most YIP and YCp vectors in common use today remain the original prototypes , plasmids that were not designed for clon - ing efficiency or versatility . Cloning in these proto - types ( YCp50 , YIp5 , etc . ) is hampered by the availa - bility of few useful cloning sites , the lack of a visual screen for recombinants , the limited variety of yeast selectable markers , and the relatively low copy num - ber of pBR322 replicons . Improved yeast vectors have been constructed ( BALDARI and CESARENI 1985 ; HILL et al . 1986 ; ELLEDGE and DAVIS 1988 ) , but to date no uniform set of multipurpose YIP and YCp vectors has been made that overcomes all of these drawbacks . In contrast to yeast vectors , Escherichia coli cloning vectors have been systematically modified and have evolved into efficient , multipurpose cloning vehicles ( BALBAS et al . 1986 ) . Perhaps the most sophisticated of these is the phagemid pBLUESCRIPT ( Strata - gene ) . It contains an fl phage origin of DNA replica - tion for the in vivo production of single stranded ( ss ) DNA and T3 / T7 phage promoters for the in vitro production of RNA . It also contains a large polylinker region and a bacterial gene that allows a color screen for recombinants so that standard cloning is greatly simplified . Genetics 122 : 19 - 27 ( May , 1989 ) In an effort to incorporate these advanced features into yeast cloning vectors , we have constructed a set of YIP and YCp vectors based on the backbone of pBLUESCRIPT . These new vectors are small ( 56 kb ) , contain many unique cloning sites , replicate to high copy number in bacteria , and offer a choice of four yeast selectable markers . The vectors make clon - ing efficient in that most DNA manipulations ( se - quencing , unidirectional deletions , mutagenesis , etc . ) can be performed in the same plasmid that is intro - duced into yeast . In addition , we have made yeast strains that contain nonrevertible ( deletion ) auxo - trophic mutations that can serve as host to any or all of these plasmids . Together , the vectors and yeast strains provide the basic materials for a wide variety of molecular genetic manipulations in S . cerevisiae . MATERIALS AND METHODS Bacterial strains and media : Escherichia coli strains DH5a [ F - , endA1 , hsdR17 ( rk - mk + ) , supE44 , thi - 1 , X , recA , gyrA96 , relAl , A ( argF - laczya ) , U169 , 080 lac ZhM151 , from Be - thesda Research Laboratories ; and MH 1066 [ AlacX74 , hsr - , rpsl , pyrETn5 , leuB600 , trpC9830 , galE , galK ] , from MIKE HALL via J . Boeke ( Johns Hopkins University ) ; were used as plasmid hosts . Recombinant plasmids containing the yeast URA3 , TRPl , or LEU2 genes were selected in MH 1066 by complementation on M9 medium with uracil ( 20 Fg / ml ) , tryptophan ( 30 rg / ml ) , or leucine ( 40 Pg / ml ) added as required . Yeast transformations and media : Yeast transformations were performed by the LiAc procedure of ITO et al . ( 1 983 ) . Media components were from Difco or Sigma . Yeast media were as described by SHERMAN , FINK and LAWRENCE ( 1 979 ) and HIETER et al . ( 1 985a ) . DNA manipulations : Restriction enzymes and DNA po - lymerases were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim and used as instructed . T4 DNA ligase was purchased from New England Biolabs .

For ligations of DNA with incompatible end structures , the ends were first made flush with Klenow DNA polymerase ( 5 ' extensions ) or T4 DNA polymerase ( 3 ' extensions ) . Recom - binant plasmids were identified by colony hybridization ( BENTON and DAVIS 1977 ) using oligonucleotide - labeled probes ( FEINBERG and VOGELSTEIN , 1983 ) or by direct complementation of E . coli mutations in JBel81 . A rapid DNA isolation procedure ( HOLMES and QUIGLEY 1981 ) was used to characterize putative clones . CsCl purified DNA was used for all cloning steps . Construction of yeast strains : All strains listed in Table 1 were derived from the diploid strain YNN216 ( JOHNSTON and DAVIS 1984 ; original source : M . CARLSON , Columbia University ) , which is congenic with S288C . Nonreverting deletion alleles of the TRPl , HIS3 , and LEU2 genes were constructed in vitro in the vector YRpl4 ( ST . JOHN et al . 1981 ) and introduced into the YNN216 background via gene replacement techniques ( SCHERER and DAVIS 1979 ) . The trpl - AI allele was constructed by inserting a 1 . 5 - kb HindIIIIEcoRI fragment ( immediately centromere proximal to the 1 . 45 - kb EcoRI / EcoRI TRPl gene containing frag - ment ) and a 2 . 7 - kb EcoRI / EcoRI fragment ( immediately centromere distal to the TRPl gene containing fragment ) into the HindIIIIEcoRI sites of YRpl4 . The 2 . 7 - kb fragment was inserted in the orientation that preserves the genomic orientation of the two fragments ( STINCHCOMB , MANN and DAVIS , 1982 ) . The resultant YRp14 / trpl - Al plasmid was digested to completion with XhoI ( which cuts uniquely in the 2 . 7 - kb fragment ) and 3 Fg used to transform strain YNN2 16 to Ura + using the LiAc procedure ( IT0 et al . 1983 ) . A single pink diploid transformant ( Le . , carrying a single integrated copy of the URA3 / SUPll plasmid ) ( HIETER et al . 1985b ) was sporulated and dissected . One white MATa ( ura3 SUPll ) haploid strain and one white MATa ( ura3 SUPll ) haploid strain were picked , each was grown nonselectively in liquid YPD medium for 5 - 10 generations , and each was plated onto YPD plates for single colonies ( 10 , 000 total colonies for each ) . Several red ( SUP1 1 gene lost ) segregants of each were picked and tested for simultaneous loss of the URA3 and TRPl markers . YPH45 ( MATa ura3 trpl ) and YPH47 ( MATa ura3 trpl ) strains were isolated and genomic DNA was prepared from each . Genomic Southern blots confirmed the presence of the trpl - A1 deletion on chro - mosome IV ( data not shown ) . The his3 - A200 allele was constructed and kindly provided by M . FASULLO ( FASULLO and DAVIS 1988 ; STRUHL and HILL 1987 ) and consists of a 1 . O - kb deletion that deletes the entire coding region of the HIS3 gene within the genomic HIS3 containing EcoRIISalI fragment cloned into the EcoRI and SalI sites of YRpl4 . An aliquot of 3 pg of the YRp14 / his3 - A200 plasmid was used to transform YNN216 to Ura + to yield a stable " pink " diploid integrant . YPH4 ( MATa ura3 his3 ) and YPH5 ( MATa ura3 his3 ) were isolated as described above and the presence of the his3 - A200 allele on chromosome XV con - firmed by genomic Southern evaluation ( data not shown ) . The leu2 - AI allele was constructed by introducing a 0 . 6 - kb EcoRI / ClaI deletion ( Klenow fill - in followed by ligation of blunt ends ) into a 2 . 2 - kb SalI / SalI LEU2 gene containing fragment cloned into pUC8 ( this fragment corresponds to the genomic 2 . 2 - kb SalI / XhoI fragment in which the XhoI site was converted to a SalI site by a synthetic linker ; M . SMITH , personal communication ) . The resultant leu2 - A1 SalI / SaZI fragment was inserted into the Sal1 site of YRpl5 New Yeast Vectors and Strains 21 ( ST . JOHN et al . 1981 ) [ Note : YRpl5 is identical to YRpl4 except for the orientation of the SUPl 1 gene with respect to the URA3 gene . ] The resultant YRp15 / leu2 - A1 plasmid was transformed into YPH45 and YPH5 and stable URA3 SUPl 1 ( white ) integrants colony purified . Ura - segregants were selected using the 5 - fluoro - orotic acid selection pro - cedure ( BOEKE , LACROUTE and FINK 1984 ) and several ura3 segregants tested for simultaneous acquisition of red and Leu - phenotypes . YPH98 ( MATa ura3 trpl leu2 ) and YPH 102 ( MATa ura3 his3 leu2 ) were isolated and shown to contain the leu2 - A1 allele on chromosome 111 by genomic Southern evaluation ( data not shown ) . YPH98 and YPHlO2 were mated , the diploid was sporulated and tetrads were dissected and scored for their Ura , Lys , Ade , His , Trp , Leu and mating phenotypes . Strains YPH266 , YPH267 , YPH258 , YPH259 , YPH262 , YPH263 , YPH250 and YPH252 are all haploid strains isolated from this cross . YPH274 was isolated by microdissection of a zygote from a mating between YPH250 and YPH252 . The alternative trpl deletion allele ( trpl - A63 ; G . YELLEN and P . HIETER , unpub - lished data ) was constructed by inserting the 1 . 5 - kb EcoRI / HindIII fragment ( immediately centromere proximal to the TRPl gene ) into the EcoRIIHindIII sites of YRpl4 . This recombinant was linearized with EcoRI , made blunt - ended by fill in with Klenow fragment polymerase , and ligated to the 0 . 8 - kb HindIII / EcoRI fragment ( made blunt - ended with Klenow fragment ) that includes the 3‘ end of the TRPl gene . Recombinant plasmids were selected in which the genomic orientation of the fragments with respect to one another was preserved . The final construct represents a 0 . 6 - kb EcoRIIHindIII deletion that deletes the promoter and 5’ portion of the TRPI gene . The trpl - A63 deletion was intro - duced into YPHlO2 as described above for the leu2 - A1 deletion . The resultant yeast strain ( GY36 ) was mated to YPHl , the diploid was sporulated , and tetrads were di - sected . YPH499 and YPH500 are spore clones derived from this cross . YP501 was isolated by microdissection of a zygote from a mating between YP499 and YP500 . Construction of new yeast integrating plasmids ( pRS3OO series ) : The pBLUESCRIPT ( Stratagene ) plasmid was modified by ligating a PvuI fragment ( bp 498 - 241 2 ) of pBLUESCRIPT ( KS , M13 + ) to a PvuI fragment ( bp 2580 - 730 ) of pBLUESCRIBE ( M13 + ; Stratagene ) . This hybrid , pRSS56 , contains the KS polylinker from pBLUESCRIPT ( see note added in proof ) and the fl ( + ) phage DNA repli - cation origin and unique AatII and NdeI restriction sites ( located between the fl origin and B - lactamase gene ) from pBLUESCRIBE . T o make a set of YIp vectors , pRSS56 was digested with NdeI , made blunt ended with Klenow polym - erase ( referred to as “blunt , Klenow” ) , and blunt - end ligated to minimal DNA segments that encode the yeast HIS3 , TRPl , LEU2 and URA3 genes to make pRS303 , pRS304 , pRS305 and pRS306 , respectively . pRS303 carries a 1 184 - bp EcoRI ( blunt , Klenow ) to BamHI ( blunt , Klenow ) fragment containing the HIS3 gene . The EcoRI site was the result of a synthetic linker placed at - 296 with respect to the first HIS3 mRNA start site ( K . STRUHL , personal communication ) . The BamHI site was a synthetic linker placed at the genomic XhoI site . pRS304 carries a 1002 - bp H i n d to PstI ( blunt , T4 DNA polymerase ) fragment containing the TRPl gene . Both sites were genomic . The EcoRI site in this fragment ( external to coding sequence ) was destroyed by EcoRI digestion , Klenow fill - in and religation . pRS305 carries a 2235 - bp Sal1 ( blunt , Klenow ) to Sal1 ( blunt , Klenow ) fragment containing the LEU2 gene . The 3‘ Sal1 site was genomic . The 5’ Sal1 site corresponds to the genomic XhoI site after modification by the addition of 100 bp + I11 I1 I ARSH4 I CEN6 k b FIGURE 1 . - Organization of the CEN6IARSH4 DNA cassette . The map is from pRSS84 , but pUC sequences are omitted . The arrow points to the location of the ARS consensus sequence . The Roman numerals refer to the conserved centromere elements . a synthetic linker ( M . SMITH , personal communication ) . pRS306 carries a 11 12 - bp SacI ( blunt , T 4 DNA polym - erase ) to SmaI fragment containing the URA3 gene . The SacI site was a modified genomic Hind111 site . This modifi - cation was necessary to destroy the HindIII site in the final construct , since ligation of the Klenow blunted HindIII and NdeI sites would have regenerated the HindIII site . The SmaI site was genomic . Construction of new yeast centromere plasmids ( pRS310 series ) : The above integrating plasmids were con - verted into mitotically stable yeast replicating plasmids by the addition of a yeast centromere sequence ( CEN ) and autonomously replicating sequence ( ARS ) . These two ele - ments were first combined to make a 5 18 bp CENIARS DNA cassette ( Figure 1 ) . A minimal centromere DNA seg - ment was obtained from pUC19 - CEN6 : 32 which has the 125 bp MboII / MboII fragment of CEN6 cloned into the HincII site of pUC19 . This small DNA fragment is sufficient to confer complete mitotic and meiotic stability when tested on a yeast chromosome fragment ( G . COTTAREL , J . SHERO , P . HIETER and H . HEGEMANN , unpublished data ) . The ARS DNA was obtained from pAB9 , which has a 374 bp Sau3AI fragment containing the histone H4 associated ARS cloned into the BamHI site of pUC8 ( BOUTON and SMITH 1986 ) . A ScaI / EcoRI fragment from pUC19 - CEN6 : 32 and a ScaI / EcoRI fragment from pAB9 were isolated and ligated to - gether such that the CEN6 and ARSH4 sequences would be juxtaposed in the polylinker region of the resulting plasmid , pRSS83 . The restriction sites between CEN6 and ARSH4 were removed by digesting pRSS83 with SmaI and XbaI , treating with Klenow to make blunt ends , and ligating to recircularize . This was done so that the cassette would not contain any restriction sites that are present in the pBLUESCRIPT polylinker . The CEN6IARSH4 cassette was then isolated from this plasmid , pRSS84 , as a HincIIIPstI fragment , made blunt with T4 DNA polymerase , and ligated into the AatII ( blunt , T4 DNA polymerase ) sites of plasmids pRS303 , pRS304 , pRS305 and pRS306 to create plasmids pRS313 , pRS314 , pRS315 and pRS316 , respectively . For uniformity , clones were selected that had the cassette ori - ented in the same direction , that is , with CEN6 closest to the 8 - lactamase gene . Restriction maps of the new YIP and YCp vectors were created ( Figure 2 ) based on the known sequences of all component parts [ HZS3 : STRUHL ( 1985 ) ; TRPl : TSCHUMPER and CARBON ( 1980 ) and DOBSON et al . ( 1 983 ) ; LEU2 : ANDREADIS et al . ( 1982 , 1984 ) ; URA3 : ROSE , GRISAFI and BOTSTEIN ( 1984 ) ; CEN6 : PANZERI and PHI - LIPPSEN ( 1982 ) ; ARSH4 : SMITH and ANDRESSON ( 1983 ) ; pBLUESCRIPT / pBLUESCRIBE : Stratagene ] . All restric - tion sites labeled in these maps were checked and shown to be correct by restriction enzyme digestion and agarose gel electrophoresis for all members of the YCp series . As would be predicted from the sequences , all sites at the junctions of blunt end ligations were destroyed . 22 R . S . Sikorski and P .

The parent vector pYCF5 is highly unstable mitotically , since it carries no CEN DNA and a very weak ARS ( ARS3 ) . About 5 rg of pRSS93 or the control plasmid YRp14IARSlICEN4 ( HIETER et al . 1985a ) were trans - formed into YPH274 . Transformants were selected on the appropriate minimal medium and replated onto nonselec - tive plates containing limiting amounts of adenine ( 6 rg / ml ) as described ( HIETER et al . 1985a ) . The color sectoring frequencies of the colonies were then compared . Quantitative assessment of CEN and ARS function in the CEN / ARS cassette : The mitotic stability of the four pRS YCp vectors was quantitated as follows . Strain YPH274 was transformed with the test plasmid and plated to selective medium . Five colonies from each transformation were picked to liquid selective medium and grown to stationary phase . The percentage of cells in this culture that contained the plasmid was determined by plating a dilution to YPD plates and replica - plating the resulting colonies to selective plates . The stationary phase culture was then diluted 1 : 1024 in minimal complete medium and growth without selection until stationary phase ( approximately 10 generations ) . Again , the percentage of cells carrying the plasmid was determined . YCp19 , a 10 . 6 kb pBR322 based vector con - taining CEN4 , ARSl , TRPl and URA3 ( C . MANN and R . DAVIS , unpublished ) , served as a control . RESULTS Construction of an isogenic set of yeast host strains : A series of yeast strains carrying various com - binations of nonreverting u r d , h i d , leu2 and trpl alleles were constructed for efficient use with the pRS vector series . All strains are derived from YNN216 , which is a strain congenic to S288C ( original source : Dr . M . CARLSON , Columbia University ) . This strain carries the nonreverting u r d - 5 2 mutation ( ROSE and WINSTON 1984 ) , sporulates well , has good DNA - me - diated transformation properties , is Gal + , and carries an amber ( lys2 - 801 ) and ochre ( ade2 - 101 ) mutation . The ade2 - 101 mutation is useful , since it allows use of the cloned SUP1 1 gene as a colony color marker ( HIETER et al . 1985a ) . In addition , the copy number of the SUP11 gene ( 0 , 1 or 2 copies ) present in the colonies can be visually distinguished ( for discussion see KOSHLAND and HIETER 1987 ) . As described in detail in MATERIALS AND METHODS , we have intro - duced nonreverting deletion alleles of the HZS3 , TRPl and LEU2 genes via gene replacement techniques , using the transplacement vectors listed in Table 2 . These strains represent an isogenic set with all com - binations of four nonreverting auxotrophic markers in both mating types . The his3 - A200 and trpl - A1 alleles eliminate essentially all homology to the HIS3 and TRPl markers present in the pRS vector series . Therefore , targeted integration and / or gene conver - sion at these sites is totally eliminated . The u r d - 5 2 , leu2 - AI , and trpl - A63 alleles are also nonreverting but retain homology to the URA3 , LEU2 and TRPl markers present on the pRS vector series . It is there - fore possible to target homologous integrative recom - bination events to the URA3 , LEU2 or TRPl loci using pRS306 , pRS305 or pRS304 , respectively . There are two important differences between the trpl deletion alleles that should be considered before choosing between them for use in particular experi - ment . The first , mentioned above , is that trpl - A63 retains homology to the TRPl selectable marker gene present in the pRS vectors , whereas trpl - AI does not . As a consequence , the possibility of integration and / or gene conversion at the TRPl iocus exists for trpl - A63 but not for trpl - AI . Therefore , the trpl - AI allele is preferable in experiments in which recombination between the vector and the genomic TRPl locus pre - sents a problem . The second difference is that the trpl - Al deletion also deletes the UAS elements re - quired for expression of the adjacent GAL3 gene , whereas the trpl - A63 deletion does not ( BAJWA , TOR - CHIA and HOPPER 1988 ) . trpl - A1 strains are therefore simultaneouslygu13 - , whereas trpl - A63 strains remain GAL3 + . Although gal3 yeast are able to utilize galac - tose as a carbon source and induce galactose regulat - able promoters fully , the kinetics of induction is slow relative to GAL3 strains . Therefore , the trpl - A63 allele is preferable in experiments that require rapid transcriptional induction by galactose . Construction of a uniform set of new yeast inte - grating plasmids : A set of four YIP vectors ( pRS303 , pRS304 , pRS305 and pRS306 ) that differ in sequence from each other only in the yeast selectable marker gene was constructed ( Figure 2 ) . A modified version of the versatile plasmid pBLUESCRIPT ( see MATE - RIALS AND METHODS ) served as the backbone for all pRS plasmids . Modification of pBLUESCRIPT was necessary to create unique cloning sites that were external to the fl origin , polylinker , and Lac2 gene . One of these sites was then used to insert minimal DNA sequences that contained the yeast HZS3 , T R P l , LEU2 or URA3 genes . Following linearization within a cloned insert DNA , and integrative transformation into the appropriate yeast host strain , pRS303 , pRS304 , pRS305 and pRS306 confer prototrophy to yeast strains carrying h i d , t r p l , leu2 or u r d muta - tions , respectively . Greatly reduced ( approximately 1 000 - fold ) numbers of transformants are produced if linearization is omitted . This is comparable to results using conventional YIP vectors ( for example , YIp5 ) and demonstrates the lack of detectable ARS activity in the modified pBLUESCRIPT sequence . Construction of a uniform set of new yeast cen - tromere plasmids : A set of YCp vectors was created by the addition of yeast ARS and CEN sequences to plasmids of the pRS YIP series ( Figure 2 ) .

For ease in manipulation , CEN6 and ARSH4 were first combined into a 518 bp DNA cassette ( Figure 1 ) . Because the proximity or organization of the two DNA elements might have adversely affected their function , we first assayed the combined function of CEN and ARS in a transforma - tion , colony - color assay ( HIETER et al . 1985a ) . The CEN6IARSH4 cassette was cloned into a YRpl4 de - rivative ( pYCF5 ) and transformed into a yeast strain containing an ochre supressible allele of ade2 . ( This vector contains a very weak ARS ( ARS3 ) and no CEN sequence and is consequently highly unstable . ) Trans - formants were produced that grew at normal rates and had a colony sectoring frequency similar to the control plasmid YRp14IARSlICEN4 , which has larger CEN and ARS sequences ( data not shown ) . The CEN6I ARSH4 cassette was then inserted into pRS303 , pRS304 , pRS305 , and pRS306 to make the YCp derivatives pRS3 13 , pRS3 14 , pRS3 15 and pRS3 16 , respectively . Circular forms of these new YCp vectors efficiently transform yeast at frequencies comparable to those obtained using conventional YCp vectors ( for example , YCp50 ; data not shown ) . As a more defini - tive test of the CEN and ARS function , we quantitated the stability of the new YCp vectors in yeast transform - ants . It is clear from the data in Table 3 that all pRS YCp vectors are as mitotically stable as the standard YCp vector YCp19 . Since mitotic stability requires ARS and CEN , we assume that both are functional in the new vectors .

DISCUSSION We have used minimal , defined segments of yeast DNA ( CEN6 , ARSH4 , HIS3 , TRPl , LEU2 and URA3 ) to convert the multipurpose E . coli plasmid pBLUESCRIPT into a set of YIP and YCp vectors . All members of the set are uniform in structure , and one need only be familiar with the cloning sites and features of pBLUESCRIPT to fully manipulate any of the pRS vectors . We have also made a set of isogenic yeast host strains containing mutations ( his3 , trpl , leu2 and ura ? ) that will allow for selection of any or all of these vectors . In addition to the general features afforded the pRS vectors by the pBLUESCRIPT backbone , such as ssDNA production , high plasmid DNA yields , an extensive polylinker , unidirectional deletion formation , and simplified cloning ( blue / white New Yeast Vectors and Strains 25 screening for recombinants ) , these new vectors offer unique yeast - specific features . The YCp vectors allow one to perform almost all routine yeast DNA manipulations in the same plasmid . A typical scheme for the characterization of a newly isolated gene can be seen in the recent analysis of CHLl ( S . GERRING and P . HIETER , unpublished re - sults ) . First , the gene was cloned by complementation of a yeast mutation and a pRS YCp vector recombi - nant was obtained . This was done by subcloning the gene from an existing library clone , but this step can obviously be bypassed if the library is made directly in the pRS vector . Next , a series of unidirectional , exonuclease I11 generated deletions were made by taking advantage of the large polylinker and flanking 3’ overhang restriction sites ( Ex0111 does not digest 3’ overhang structures ) . Since these deletion con - structs can be transformed directly into yeast , the borders of the gene were easily identified by assaying several representative deletions for loss of comple - menting activity . The deletions beyond the gene bor - der were directly converted into ssDNA templates for sequencing . Deletion series generated from two clones ( direct and inverted gene orientations ) yielded se - quencing data from both DNA strands as well as the functional 5’ ( promoter ) and 3’ borders of the gene . The unidirectional deletions generated in a pRS vector have several uses in addition to sequencing . The 3’ deletions can be used to define activity do - mains ( such as DNA binding regions in DNA binding proteins ) or they can serve as potential dominant negative ( HERSKOWITZ 1987 ) mutant alleles . The 5’ deletions can be cloned into bacterial expression vec - tors ( e . g . , PATH ) for the production of fusion pro - teins . Appropriate 5’ deletions ( within the 5‘ untrans - lated leader ) can also be used directly in an in vitro coupled transcription / translation reaction ( HOPE and STRUHL 1985 ) using the phage promoter on the vec - tor . In addition , by combining 5’ and 3’ deletions one can construct null alleles ( deletions ) , which can then be recombined into the yeast chromosome . The extensive polylinker region makes the YIP vectors ideal for a gene disruption procedure that we have termed “y transformation” ( a variation of “Q transformation” ; ROTHSTEIN , 1983 ) . Sequences flank - ing the DNA to be deleted are cloned into the poly - linker of a pRS YIP vector in tandem but reverse order leaving a unique restriction site between them ( Figure 3 ) . Transformation of the linearized construct results in a deletion mutation at the chosen locus and the insertion of plasmid DNA . This method has been used with a pRS vector to disrupt the yeast CKAI gene ( C . GLOVER , personal communication ) and to introduce a centromere deletion / substitution allele onto chromosome VI ( H . HEGEMANN , personal com - munication ) . y transformation is especially useful Plasmid Construct : 1 AIIX + Homologous Recombmallon : 1 - I Deletion I Inseltion Mutation : + xnv R FIGURE 3 . - Modification of a genomic locus by “y - transforma - tion . ” DNA segments flanking the segment that is to be deleted are cloned into a pRS YIP in tandem but reverse order . After lineari - zation at the site designated with an arrow and transformation , the construct recombines as shown ( when diagrammed , this structure resembles the Greek letter y ) . The overall result is a deletion of the chosen DNA segment and an insertion of the entire plasmid . AUX + refers to the selectable marker gene . when the restriction sites required to create a partic - ular deletion are not unique in the cloned locus . In such cases ( which in our experience are quite com - mon ) , making the deletion by an Q transformation construct would require complex , partial restriction enzyme digestion followed by insertion of a yeast selectable marker DNA fragment . In contrast , making such a deletion by a y transformation construct ( a two - step cloning procedure ) will often be simple due to the extensive polylinker in the pRS vectors . The streamlined design of the pRS vectors makes them well suited to serve as the starting point for construction of other yeast vectors . High copy 2p type plasmids ( YEp ) are useful for overexpressing gene products , but the standard 2p vectors are also not optimized for DNA manipulations . Insertion of a small DNA fragment containing the 2p origin andjZp site into the AatII site of a pRS YIP vector makes it high copy in yeast , and several pRS 2p derivatives have already been made ( J . SHERO and P . HIETER , unpublished results ) . Genes manipulated in pRS YIP or YCp vector recombinants can readily be converted to pRS YEP recombinants by exchanging PvuI - PvuI segments between these plasmids . For example , with pRS303 this would mean replacing PvuI ( 3833 ) - PvuI ( 1920 ) with the corresponding segment from a pRS 26 R . S . Sikorski and P . Hieter 2p plasmid . Since recognition sites for PvuI ( double CG , six base pair ) are very rare in yeast DNA , this will usually be possible . ( Alternatively , flanking sites in the polylinker can be used with some inserts . ) In fact , exchange of PvuI segments can be used to conven - iently shuffle DNA segments between all pRS vectors when a different marker gene or vector type is needed . Overexpression vectors can also be designed using heterologous promoters . Since the polylinker region contains a continuous open reading frame with no ATG start codons in any frame , it can serve as untranslated leader sequence or coding sequence , de - pending on the vector . For example , we have inserted a cassette containing the inducible GALlIGALlO pro - moters into the KpnI site in two orientations . One orientation has an mRNA start but no ATG ; the other orientation has an mRNA start and an ATG that is in frame with the LacZ gene . Interestingly , E . coli colo - nies carrying this latter plasmid remain blue on X - gal plates ( R . S . SIKORSKI , unpublished observation ) . Because the yeast strains that we have made will allow the use of four different selectable markers , they have the potential to accommodate up to four different plasmids . This can be useful in those exper - iments requiring the modification of several genetic loci in the same cell , for example , when a gene family is being studied . The gene replacement vectors listed in Table 2 can be used to introduce trpl , leu2 and his3 deletion mutations into any existing ura3 strain . The resultant strains are perfectly isogenic to the original parent and become competent for use of the set of pRS vectors and for the DNA manipulations made possible by them . Addendum regarding production of LacZ’ fusion proteins : We have been notified by Stratagene that all pBLUESCRIPT KS plasmids contain a cryptic single base pair deletion of one of the three Gs ( GCTGGGTACC ) immediately upstream of the KpnI site of the polylinker and downstream of the LACZ‘ initiating ATG codon . The only consequence of this missing nucleotide is a change in the polylinker - LacZ’ reading frame . E . coli colonies carrying this plasmid , however , still remain ( by an unknown mechanism ) blue on X - gal medium , and inactivation of the blue color phenotype by insertion of cloned DNA can still be used to identify recombinants . All applications of the pRS vectors described in this paper are unaffected by this base deletion . However , if one plans to use the LacZ promoter and the polylinker open reading frame to make fusion proteins one must be aware of this frame shift and adjust the predicted reading frame accordingly . Recently , a new set of pRS vectors has been created that utilizes the polylinker of pBLUESCRIPT I1 ( which does contain the G residue mentioned above and also contains flanking BssHII sites ) . These new plasmids , pRS403 , 404 , 405 , 406 , 413 , 414 , 415 , and 416 , which are structurally similar to pRS 303 , 304 , 305 , 306 , 313 , 314 , 315 , and 316 , respectively , are recommended if expression of a LacZ‘ fusion protein is intended .
