However , it remains a question whether interdisciplinary collaboration research is more disruptive than monodisciplinary research . To address this research question in this study , interdisciplinary collaboration is measured as whether the authors of a paper are from at least two disciplines , and the degree of " disruptive " is measured by the Disruption index proposed by Funk & Owen - Smith ( 2017 ) . By using articles published in six journals from 1978 to 2019 in the Microsoft Academic Graph ( MAG ) database , we constructed an OLS regression model with journal fixed effect and time fixed effect to analyze the influence of interdisciplinary collaboration on the Disruption values with different citation windows . The findings show that interdisciplinary collaboration research is less disruptive than monodisciplinary research . KEYWORDS Interdisciplinary collaboration , Disruption , Regression analysis . INTRODUCTION Interdisciplinary collaboration is being widely practised in various fields . It provides new solutions under the situation that monodisciplinary research cannot solve increasingly complex social and scientific problems . An application - based knowledge production model has gradually replaced the traditional discipline - based knowledge production model , and interdisciplinarity is typical of the latter ( Agassi , 1997 ; Chen , Arsenault , & Lariviere , 2015 ; Gibbons et al . , 1994 ) . Studies show that scientific research is gradually becoming interdisciplinary ( Porter & Rafols , 2009 ; Van Noorden , 2015 ) . Interdisciplinary research and multidisciplinary research are both referred to as scientists from two or more disciplines working together to solve a scientific problem . However , different from multidisciplinary research , interdisciplinary collaboration research emphasizes the integration of knowledge . It integrates mutually independent knowledge spaces to generate new methodologies , knowledge , and even new disciplines that can address complex problems in modern science ( D ' Este , Llopis , Rentocchini , & Yegros , 2019 ; Klein , 2008 ) . Interdisciplinary collaboration overturns the inherent boundaries and barriers between disciplines and provides a broader perspective on problem - solving . Many studies have confirmed that interdisciplinary research has a special impact on scientific impact ( Yegros - Yegros , Rafols , & D ' Este , 2015 ) and that collaboration in more distant disciplines can lead to greater success ( Lariviere , Haustein , & Boerner , 2015 ) . Scientific innovation can be divided into two categories , disruptive and developing work . Disruptive innovation represents a departure from previous knowledge while developing work confirms and develops previous theories ( Andersen , 2013 ; Funk & Owen - Smith , 2017 ; Wu , Wang , & Evans , 2019 ) . Innovation and creative thinking are the key factors that promote scientific breakthroughs ( Xu et al . , 2018 ) . Comments about the relationship between interdisciplinary research and innovation are that interdisciplinary research is a catalyst for innovation . Some evidence of the development history of modern science indicates that major scientific breakthroughs , new growth points , and even the emergence of new disciplines are often realized in intersecting and infiltrating different disciplines , such as the discovery of the double helix structure of DNA molecules , etc . Interdisciplinary collaboration can bring about the diversity of knowledge and make research output more novel . ( Fontana , Iori , Montobbio , & Sinatra , 2020 ; Lee , Walsh , & Wang , 2015 ) . The interdisciplinary collaboration reflects heterogeneous knowledge , which is an important manifestation of the innovation process ( ( Karakowsky & McBey , 2001 ) ) . The ASIS & T Annual Meeting 2021 265 Long Papers exchange and generation of ideas among academic team members , even to the point of disagreement and conflict , is considered to lead to creativity and innovation . ( Leahey , Beckman , & Stanko , 2017 ) . Recently , science and technology policy makers are vigorously promoting interdisciplinary collaboration , and scientists are also actively seeking interdisciplinary collaboration opportunities . The influence of interdisciplinary collaboration on scientific impact and team creativity has been demonstrated . However , there is still a lack of more empirical evidence on the value and effectiveness of interdisciplinary research . We hence propose the following research question in this study , Is interdisciplinary collaboration research more disruptive than monodisciplinary research ? LITERATURE REVIEW AND HYPOTHESIS There are two opposing views in existing theories to interpret the relationship between interdisciplinary collaboration and disruption , based on which , we propose two competitive hypotheses . Proponents of interdisciplinary research assume that disciplines represent silos that are separate from each other and that these silos hinder innovation and prevent the exploration of topics beyond the narrow scope of each discipline ( Jacobs & Frickel , 2009 ) . They believe that interdisciplinarity can facilitate disruptive innovation by breaking down barriers to knowledge dissemination and pre - existing knowledge frameworks according to the burden of knowledge mechanism and Kuhn ' s paradigm theory . The burden of knowledge mechanism suggests that knowledge innovation is a continuous process of accumulation . Subsequent innovators need a large stock of knowledge than their predecessors to reach the frontier , which leads to a greater knowledge burden on them ( Jones , 2009 ) . The burden of knowledge accumulation drives scientists to focus on their own fields . In this case , individual’s knowledge is narrowed to a specific topic or field . Therefore , forming a research team of scientists from different disciplines to collaborate with each other becomes an effective method for solving a complex problem , in which scientists from different fields will contribute knowledge from their respective areas of expertise . Interdisciplinary research increases the diversity of knowledge and thus counteracts the increasing problem of specialization in various fields ( Cedrini & Fontana , 2017 ) . The formation of disciplinary systems leads to the dependence of scientists on the existing research paradigms . According to Kuhn ' s paradigm theory , innovation is an important factor in the growth of scientific knowledge , and theoretical innovation is the process by which a new theoretical paradigm replaces an old one ( Kuhn , 1962 ) . However , on the one hand , there is a certain " resilience " mechanism in theory itself , which can motivate people to adjust the anomalous results until they are non - anomalous . On the other hand , there is an element of inertia in people ' s social psychology , which makes them more inclined to defend knowledge that they are already familiar with and that most people agree on and accept ( Kuhn , 1962 ) . With these two factors , the anomalies in the study are usually dissipated . Mono - disciplinary communities of highly specialized experts will remain isolated , making it difficult to achieve innovation . When scientists with different knowledge background collaborate , some divergent ideas can lead to radical innovations ( Andersen , 2013 ) . It has been confirmed that scientific breakthroughs usually occur when another discipline unexpectedly solves a problem in one discipline at a greater disparity ( Shi & Evans , 2019 ) . The risks and reliance on existing research paradigms lead to a tendency to segment knowledge ( Abramo , D ' Angelo , & Di Costa , 2018 ) . Scientists confined to specialized discipline are often unable to break out of their inherent knowledge framework . By contrast , interdisciplinary research provides a channel for the collision and convergence of multiple knowledge and fully breaks down the boundaries between disciplines by integrating knowledge . In this way , it is more likely to produce new knowledge that overturns traditional research . Therefore , we propose the following hypothesis : H 1 : Interdisciplinary collaboration research is more disruptive than monodisciplinary research . However , Proponents of monodisciplinary research argue that disruption is based on a deep understanding of knowledge in a specialized discipline . Based on Kuhn’s paradigm theory , monodisciplinary research focuses on problems within the field of expertise , and such sustained work is far more productive than interdisciplinary collaboration and more likely to uncover deeper problems in the field , thus breaking with tradition ( Kuhn , 1969 ) . Interdisciplinary collaboration is only a product of modern knowledge moving to the edge , which is just a catalyst to assist knowledge production . Its knowledge structure is constructed hastily and is not solid . With the differentiation and refinement of disciplines , deepen the study of things are necessary . So it is difficult to produce disruptive output if scientific research has not accumulated to a certain extent . From the perspective of social identity theory , scholars argue that disciplinary heterogeneity gives rise to a process of social categorization ( Judge & Ferris , 1993 ) . The existence of disciplinary heterogeneity in interdisciplinary collaboration makes team members less cohesive , even increases the likelihood of conflict and inhibits team ASIS & T Annual Meeting 2021 266 Long Papers performance . Various obstacles have greatly increased the coordination cost of interdisciplinary collaboration ( Cummings & Kiesler , 2005 ) . Heterogeneity will impede information sharing and knowledge dissemination among team members , with adverse consequences for innovation in research teams ( Auh & Menguc , 2005 ) . Based on these theories , we propose a competitive hypothesis relative to H 1 : H 2 : Interdisciplinary collaboration research is less disruptive than monodisciplinary research . DATA AND METHODOLOGY Data collection Interdisciplinary collaboration is usually proxied by interdisciplinary co - authorship in academic articles . In this study , we collected papers from the Microsoft Academic Graph ( MAG ) database . To explore the causal effect between interdisciplinary collaboration and disruption of an article , other influencing factors need to be controlled as much as possible . Due to the interdisciplinary nature of many journals , the research fields and research topics of the papers published in them can be diverse . Since the citations to articles are only comparable in the same research fields , journals focusing on only one specific research topic were sampled . By consulting experts in both natural sciences and humanities & social sciences , six academic journals were finally selected , including Late Imperial China ( focusing on the studies of the history of China’s Qing dynasty ) , Scientometrics ( focusing on scientometric studies ) , Biomaterials ( focusing on the studies of biomaterials ) , Autophagy ( focusing on the studies of autophagy ) , Journal of Informetrics ( focusing on informetric studies ) and Neuron ( focusing on the studies of neuron ) . The bibliographic information of the papers in these journals with a time span of 1978 - 2019 was obtained from MAG . Measurement of interdisciplinary collaboration Scientists have made a lot of explorations on quantifying interdisciplinary collaboration , which can be measured by the output of research , projects or proposals ( Wang et al . , 2017 ) . The discipline to which the participant belongs is the main way of judging interdisciplinary collaboration . In a sense , the author ' s subject area can be considered as their knowledge sharing among the project ( Giovanni Abramo , 2018 ) . The problem of this type of measurement methods is how to map the authors to the corresponding disciplines . The commonly used way is based on the institution to which he or she belongs ( Schummer , 2004 ; Abramo , D ' Angelo , & Di Costa , 2017 ) . Interdisciplinary collaboration can be conducted by combining scientists from different disciplinary backgrounds . In this study , whether the authors of the article belong to the same discipline was used to judge whether the collaboration is interdisciplinary . In the university or research institution system , department , school , or college levels are usually the smallest units of academic operation . The author ' s discipline is judged based on the secondary institution ( schools or departments ) with which the author is affiliated with . Therefore , extracting the name of the second unit from the attribution unit of the author in the bibliographic information is required . After removing articles with single authors and the missing values , a total of 11 , 469 articles were obtained . Measurement of Disruption We adopted the Disruption Index ( D - index ) to measure knowledge innovation ( Wu , Wang , & Evans , 2019 ) . D - index was first proposed by Funk & Owen - Smith ( 2017 ) and applied to patents . Wu et al . ( 2019 ) extended this index to papers and computer software and proposed D - index , which is based on citation networks , to measure whether research develops or disrupts the existing research . The measurement idea of the D - index is dividing the cited papers into three categories . The first type of research ( i ) is to cite only the focal paper , the second type of research ( j ) is to cite both the focal paper and its references , and the third type of research ( k ) is to cite only references of the focal paper . Figure1 illustrates three types of research . The ratio of the difference between the number of the second type of literature and the number of the first type of literature to the total number of references is used to measure whether the paper is disruptive . The formula for calculating D - index of the focal paper is as follows : 𝐷 = 𝑛 𝑖 − 𝑛 𝑗 𝑛 𝑖 + 𝑛 𝑗 + 𝑛 𝑘 where 𝑛 𝑖 , 𝑛 𝑗 and 𝑛 𝑘 represent the number of i , j , and k , respectively . The values of D range from - 1 and 1 , which indicates that the focal paper develops ( D < 0 ) or disrupts ( D > 0 ) the current knowledge or remains neutral ( D = 0 ) . The larger the value of D is , the more disruptive the focal paper is . ASIS & T Annual Meeting 2021 267 Long Papers Figure1 . Illustration of the disruption index It should be noted that some studies have found that the size of the D - index is related to the length of the citation window , and they recommend a citation window of at least three years ( Bornmann & Tekles , 2019 ) . Therefore , we explored three lengths of citation windows : D5 , five - year citation window ; D10 , ten - year citation window ; and Dn , citation window from publication to present . D - index under these types of citation windows were calculated for each sampled article . Variable operationalization and models The purpose of our study is to analyze the relationship between interdisciplinary collaboration and disruption . The dependent variable is the D - index calculated by the three lengths of citation windows . We define whether the publication is interdisciplinary collaboration as an independent variable . Obviously , the independent variable is binary . If the authors of an article belong to different secondary institutions , it is classified as interdisciplinary collaboration research ; if it belongs to the same secondary institution , it is monodisciplinary research . All variables that affect the dependent variable should be controlled in the model . According to previous studies , we selected the following variables as control variables : the number of authors in the paper , the length of the paper title , and the number of references . Since the value of D - index is calculated by the citations , we try to cover the factors related to citations as much as possible based on the existing data . Below interprets these variables and the reasons why we chose them . Number of references : The number of references is correlated with citations . Articles that cite more references are in turn cited more ( Bornmann & Leydesdorff , 2015 ; Webster , Jonason , & Schember , 2009 ) Length of title : Many studies have explored the impact of title length on citations that papers received . Although these studies do not reach an agreement , some believe that there is a positive correlation between the two ( Habibzadeh & Yadollahie , 2010 ) , and some believe that there is no obvious correlation or has a negative correlation between the two ( Rostami , Mohammadpoorasl , & Hajizadeh , 2014 ) . Number of authors : The number of authors reflects the size of the team . There is a difference in the D - index between large teams and small teams ( Wu et al . , 2019 ) , and the correlation between the two is negative ( Lyu , et al . , 2021 ) . Tables 1 and 2 summarize the results of the descriptive statistics of each variable in a total of 11 , 469 papers and the correlation between the variables . Correlation between the independent variables indicates that there is a moderate risk of multicollinearity . Therefore , we further tested the variance inflation factor ( VIF ) of each variable . The results show that the VIF factors of all quantitative variables are far less than ten , and their tolerances are greater than 0 . 2 , so the multicollinearity problem between independent variables can be ignored here .

Correlation coefficient of the variables The ordinary least squares model was adopted for analyzing the causal effects between explanatory variables and explained variables . Since the citations of an article are affected by the journal ' s reputation , and the scientific impact of articles in different journals is different . In order to eliminate the quality differences between different articles , we learned from previous research and considered the fixed effect of journals . Fixed effects model is suitable for panel data , which uses dumpy variables to find differences of several categories of a specific varible . We conducted a Hausman specification test on the data , and the results show that journal fixed effects are more effective than random - effects models in estimating the impact of interdisciplinarity collaboration research on disruption . Besides , the volume and number of journals are fixed in the model to overcome time interference . To verify the hypothesis , we constructed an OLS equation containing all the above variables . We consider both the fixed effect of the journal and the fixed effect of the publication time , and the regression model is shown below .

( 1 ) RESULTS Statistical description The number of articles from interdisciplinary collaboration research and monodisciplinary research is not much different in the sample dataset . There are differences in the quantity distribution of interdisciplinary collaboration in different fields . It can be seen from Figure 1 that journals in the field of humanities and social sciences , such as Late Imperial China and Scientometrics , has more monodisciplinary papers . However , journals in natural sciences , such as Biomaterial and Autophagy , have more interdisciplinary papers . Besides , the distributions of 3 types of D - index in interdisciplinary collaboration and monodisciplinary research are reported in Figure 3 . It can be observed that , regardless of whether it is an interdisciplinary or disciplinary paper , most of the D - index value are around 0 . But compared to interdisciplinary papers , monodisciplinary papers are more inclined to the distribution in the range of D - index value greater than 0 . Figure 2 .

The distribution of three types of disruption index Regression results Table 3 displays the estimations of the fixed effect regression models . Models ( 1 ) - ( 3 ) use the D - index in different citation windows as the dependent variables . The results show that the effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable is significant under either of the citation windows . Among them , the coefficient of the independent variable is α = - 0 . 00402 ( p < 0 . 1 ) for the 5 - year citation window , α = - 0 . 0042 ( p < 0 . 1 ) for the 10 - year citation window , and α = - 0 . 00452 ( p < 0 . 05 ) for citation window from publication to present . This indicates that interdisciplinary collaboration research is less disruptive , while monodisciplinary research is more disruptive .

Results of fixed effects regression models ASIS & T Annual Meeting 2021 270 Long Papers DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS In general , we investigated the relationships between interdisciplinary collaboration and the disruption index of articles by using OLS regressions with fixed effects . Articles in the sample are divided into two groups : interdisciplinary collaborative research and monodisciplinary research . Factors that have a potential relationship with the independent variable and the dependent variables are included as much as possible in the model , and we controlled journal and publication time effect . H 1 is rejected and H 2 is accepted , in terms of the empirical analysis results of this study . It shows that interdisciplinary collaboration research is less disruptive than monodisciplinary research . Since this model has stricter control of variables compared with simple regression analysis , it can explain the causal effect of interdisciplinary on disruption to a certain extent . In other words , interdisciplinary collaboration produces less disruptive research . The result seems contrary to the widespread perception that interdisciplinary collaboration research can lead to more disruptive scientific output . But it indeed provides factual evidence for H 2 . Because of the lack of in - depth professional domain knowledge , interdisciplinary collaboration is difficult to make fundamental breakthrough innovations . Besides , the results show that there is a negative correlation between team size and disruption values , which also confirms the view that small teams are often more disruptive than big team ( Wu et al . , 2019 ; Lyu , Gong , Ruan , Cheng , & Li , 2021 ) . There is also a negative correlation between the number of references and the length of the paper title and disruption values . Our findings emphasize that in the current situation of blindly advancing interdisciplinary collaboration , we should realize that the interdisciplinary paradigm is not beneficial to all research and teams ( Jin & Sun , 2010 ) . The study sheds lights on the mechanism of interdisciplinary collaboration . It is undeniable that interdisciplinary collaboration has indeed brought new ideas and methods to solve complex problems and promoted the development of scientific research . Achieving good interdisciplinary collaboration in actual scientific research to produce knowledge with real innovative value is a question worth pondering . Undoubtedly , the excellent output of interdisciplinary is also inseparable from the support of the external environment , for example , a complete discipline evaluation system is needed ( Bromham , Dinnage , & Hua , 2016 ) . There are unavoidable limitations in this study . First , we only used the paper data of six journals to analyze the relationship between interdisciplinary and disruptive innovation . Whether the results apply to other journals needs further investigation . Second , the interdisciplinary collaboration is measured by whether the authors are from different secondary institutions . We do not consider that even if it is the same secondary institution , different primary institutions and different countries may have differences in subject positioning . Last but not least , in order to achieve a more stringent causal inference effect , more indicators related to citations and D - index should be included in the regression model . For example , scientists’ knowledge background and personality which potentially affect both the preference of interdisciplinary collaboration and their citations , are not controlled in our regression model . These issues will be considered in future work . REFERENCES Abramo , G . , D ' Angelo , C . A . , & Di Costa , F . ( 2017 ) . Do interdisciplinary research teams deliver higher gains to science ?
