Key Points 27 Question : Which SARS - CoV - 2 variant is responsible for 6 cases of vaccine breakthrough , one 28 interventional monoclonal antibody treatment , and one death ? 29 Findings : Viral sequencing revealed 6 vaccinated patients were infected with the Delta SARS - 30 CoV - 2 variant . With no histories of vaccine breakthrough , this suggests Delta variant may 31 possess immune evasion in patients that received the Pfizer BNT162b2 , Moderna mRNA - 1273 , 32 and Covaxin BBV152 . 33 Meaning : Delta variant may pose the highest risk out of any currently circulating SARS - CoV - 2 34 variants , with increased transmissibility over Alpha variant and possible vaccine breakthrough . 35 36 Abstract 37 Importance : Vaccine breakthrough by an emergent SARS - CoV - 2 variant poses a great risk to 38 global public health . 39 Objective : To determine the SARS - CoV - 2 variant responsible for 6 cases of vaccine 40 breakthrough . 41 Design : Nasopharyngeal swabs from suspected vaccine breakthrough cases were tested for 42 SARS - CoV - 2 by qPCR for Wuhan - Hu1 and Alpha variant . Positive samples were then 43 sequenced by Swift Normalase Amplicon Panels to determine the causal variant . 44 Setting : Transmission event occurred at events surrounding a wedding outside of Houston , TX . 45 Two patients from India , likely transmitted the Delta variant to other guests . 46 Participants : Following a positive SARS - CoV - 2 qPCR test at a third - party site , six fully 47 vaccinated patients were investigated . Three males and three females ranged from 53 to 69 48 years old . One patient suffered from diabetes while three others were classified as overweight . 49 No significant other comorbidities were identified . None of the patients had a history of failed 50 vaccination . 51 52 .

Africa ) , Gamma ( P . 1 Brazil ) , Epsilon ( B . 1 . 429 55 California ) , Iota ( B . 1 . 526 New York ) and now , Delta and Kappa ( B . 1 . 617 . 2 and B . 1 . 617 . 1 India ) . 56 Each of these strains gained advantageous mutations to become a dominant strain , e . g . , Iota 57 first discovered November 23 , 2020 , represented 45 % of new cases as of February 7 , 2021 1 . 58 Increased transmissibility results from genomic changes such as nonsynonymous mutations in 59 the receptor - binding domain ( RBD ) of the S - gene ( encodes the spike protein ) conferring higher 60 binding affinity to host angiotensin - converting enzyme 2 ( ACE2 ) receptors or more efficient 61 cleavage by Transmembrane Serine Protease 2 ( TMPRSS2 ) and subsequently , viral entry 2 , 3 . 62 Mutations could also lead to vaccine breakthrough 4 . The spike protein’s RBD is 63 immunodominant 5 , targeted by convalescent sera and vaccine - elicited antibodies ( Pfizer 64 BNT162b2 6 ) , though evidence suggest substantial role of the amino - terminal domain ( NTD ) . 65 Mutations in the RBD therefore pose a risk of allowing immune evasion to one or more of the 66 current vaccines 4 . The Kappa and Delta variants emerged from the Indian state of Maharashtra 67 in December 2020 , contributing to a resurgence of cases in the country , representing 70 % of 68 daily new cases on May 2 , 2021 7 . The B . 1 . 617 lineage is now widely circulating in over 50 69 countries based on viral sequence data and is classified as a variant of concern by the CDC . 70 The Kappa and Delta variant lineages are defined by 7 and 8 nonsynonymous mutations in the 71 S protein respectively ( Figure 1 ) . 72 Emergent data suggests partial immunity to the Kappa variant , as convalescent sera and 73 vaccine - elicited ( Pfizer BNT162b2 and Moderna mRNA - 1273 ) antibodies show a 2 . 3 - and 4 - fold 74 reduction in neutralization in vitro respectively ( noting that this study used protein - pseudotyped 75 lentiviruses lacking the T478K mutation found in Delta variant ) 8 . A test negative case control 76 study estimated the effectiveness of vaccination ( two weeks post second vaccination ) against 77 .

Attendance required guests be fully vaccinated and took place outdoors in a 82 large , open - air tent . To date , 6 individuals have tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 , all patients 83 were symptomatic , one patient severely enough to receive monoclonal antibody infusion 84 treatment ( Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc . ) and one patient has died . Encounter timings and 85 viral sequence similarities suggest the strain containing the Delta variant was transmitted to 86 wedding guests from two patients travelling from India . With no history of vaccine failure in 87 these patients , our observations suggest these are true cases of vaccine breakthrough , 88 mediated by the Delta variant . 89 90 Results 91 In early April , 2021 , Patient 0a , a man with no comorbidities , and Patient 0b , a woman with 92 diabetes , travelled from India to attend a wedding in Texas ( designated 0a and 0b due to 93 difficulty establishing true patient 0 ) . Both tested negative for SARS - CoV - 2 by qPCR as part of 94 the pre - flight criteria . Formal wedding events were held outdoors and in a large open - air tent 95 and attendance required full vaccination ( Patient 0a and 0b travelled to Houston 10 days after 96 their second doses of Covaxin BBV152 , Table 1 ) . Patients 1 - 5 confirmed having close 97 encounters with Patient 0a and 0b at the wedding . Events were attended by fewer than 100 98 guests . 99 On the evening of the first night of the wedding , Patient 0b complained of fatigue but associated 100 it with diabetes and jet lag . Patient 0a developed a cough two days after the wedding and both 101 him and Patient 0b developed a fever three days after . Patient 0a and 0b tested positive for 102 SARS - CoV - 2 by nasal swab qPCR 4 days after the wedding at a third - party site . Patient 0a’s 103 .

He was transferred to Baylor St . Luke’s hospital in the Texas Medical Center with 105 worsening symptoms . A month after the wedding , Patient 0a died from complications of COVID - 106 19 . 107 Five other guests have tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 following confirmed interactions with 108 Patient 0a and 0b . All positive patients received Pfizer BNT162b2 , Moderna mRNA - 1273 , or 109 Covaxin BBV152 ( Table 1 ) . Six of these have experienced symptoms of COVID - 19 ( Table 1 ) . 110 Patient 1 , who received the Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine developed severe symptoms and was 111 admitted to Baylor St . Luke’s hospital for monoclonal antibody infusion treatment ( Regeneron 112 Pharmaceuticals Inc . ) on ten days after the wedding . The density of vaccine breakthrough 113 resulting in COVID - 19 symptoms suggested the patients were carrying a SARS - CoV - 2 variant . 114 To characterize the variant , total RNA was extracted from nasopharyngeal swabs of each of the 115 6 patients . All positive for SARS - CoV - 2 Wuhan - Hu - 1 and negative for Alpha variant by qPCR 116 ( Table 1 ) . Human RNase P ( RP ) gene control values suggested sampling of patients and RNA 117 isolation were performed optimally . Amplicon libraries were successfully prepared from all 6 118 qPCR positive samples ( N1 Ct value 17 – 29 ) , with 900 , 754 – 2 , 381 , 756 pass - filter reads 119 generated using Swift Biosciences Sarscov2 analysis pipeline ( sTable 1 ) . Median sequence 120 coverage ranged from 2085x to 12 , 932x with > 99 . 7 % of the genome covered at 40x or greater . 121 All 6 samples were identified as the SARS - CoV - 2 Delta variant based on the presence of the 10 122 mutations listed by the CDC’s ‘Selected Characteristics of SARS - CoV - 2 Variants of Interest’ . 123 These mutations , located on the S protein were T19R , ( G142D ) , 156del , 157del , R158G , 124 L452R , T478K , D614G , P681R , D950N . 156del , 157del , R158G are annotated as a single 125 mutation ( S : GAGTTCA22028G : Glu156 _ Arg158delinsGly ) due to their proximity ( Figure 1 ) . 126 Phylogenetic analysis places each patient sample in a subclade of the Delta variant ( white box , 127 Figure 2 ) . 128 129 .

Variants emerge from areas 132 experiencing uncontrolled viral spread and display increased transmissibility due to mutations in 133 the spike protein . These mutations may occur in the antigenic region of the RBD , altering 134 binding sites for vaccine - elicited antibodies . Mutations such as the ones found in the Kappa 135 variant , provide partial resistance to antibody neutralization ( Pfizer BNT162b2 , Moderna mRNA - 136 1273 , Regeneron 8 , and Covaxin BBV152 10 ) , likely due to changes in epitope sequence . 137 Vaccine breakthrough by highly transmissible variants ( Delta variant up to 50 % more 138 transmissible than Alpha variant , SAGE ) could lead to significant setbacks in pandemic control 139 efforts , requiring renewed social distancing and masking efforts . Significant vaccine 140 breakthrough could necessitate vaccine boosters or targeted lockdowns to reduce spread of 141 infection . An analysis of spike protein epitopes found several antigenic regions ( IDa - IDi , Zhange 142 et al . ) . Delta variant spike protein contains mutations in three of these regions ( 450 – 469 IDf , 143 480 – 499 IDg , and 522 – 646 IDh , Figure 1 ) possibly resulting in decreased neutralization by 144 vaccine - elicited antibodies . 145 According to the cases presented in this study , antibodies elicited in patients receiving Pfizer 146 BNT162b2 , Moderna mRNA - 1273 , and Covaxin BBV152 may provide decreased immunity to 147 the Delta variant . It is possible that some individuals in this study failed to produce an effective 148 immune response to their immunization , however , none of the patients had a history of vaccine 149 failure . 150 Our observations support continued efforts to generate SARS - CoV - 2 genomic sequences from 151 positive patient samples , in order to identify possible vaccine breakthrough mutations . The 152 continued effectiveness of vaccine - elicited antibodies towards SARS - CoV - 2 variants highlights 153 the importance of vaccination efforts . Partial efficacy of current vaccines ( 70 % at 75 % coverage ) 154 .

Slowing the spread could prevent emergence of 155 future variants , hastening the end of this pandemic . 156 157 Materials and Methods 158 Specimen collection and ethical considerations 159 All individuals were initially tested by third party SARS - CoV - 2 testing sites . To confirm , 160 nasopharyngeal swabs were collected by a physician or nurse as close to the first positive test 161 as possible . Samples were submitted to the Alkek Center for Metagenomics and Microbiome 162 Research for RNA extraction and the Human Genome Sequencing Center for qPCR 163 confirmation . Protocols for collection , qPCR testing , and whole genome sequencing were 164 approved by the Baylor College of Medicine Institutional Review Board ( H - 47423 ) . 165 166 cDNA synthesis and amplicon libraries . 167 RNA extracted from nasopharyngeal swabs of six individuals that tested positive for SARS - 168 COV - 2 using qPCR was converted to 1st strand cDNA using SuperScript™ IV First - Strand 169 Synthesis System ( Thermo Fisher , Cat . No . 18091050 ) . The 1st strand cDNA reaction was 170 performed starting with 10 µl of total RNA in 25 µl reaction mix , which was incubated at 23ºC for 171 10 minutes followed by 50ºC for 50 minutes . The resulting 1 st strand cDNA was then diluted with 172 DEPC treated water , where for two samples with Ct < 24 cDNA was diluted 20 times and for the 173 remaining four samples , with Ct > 24 , cDNA was diluted 2 times , respectively . This diluted 1 st 174 strand cDNA ( 10 ul ) was used as input for amplification of the SARS - CoV - 2 viral genome , using 175 the SARS - CoV - 2 Additional Genome Coverage Panel ( Cat # COVG1V2 - 96 ) . This panel was 176 designed against SARS - CoV - 2 Wuhan - Hu - 1 strain ( NC _ 045512 . 2 ) and has 345 amplicons of 177 116 - 255 bp ( average 150 bp ) that cover 99 . 7 % ( 29 , 828 of 29 , 903 total bases ) of the genome . 178 These amplicons come in a single tube , and the workflow involves two rounds of PCR , a 179 multiplex PCR ( 4 + 18 cycles ) and the indexing PCR ( 9 cycles ) to generate sequence ready 180 .

The reaction mixes and the thermocycler conditions were performed according to the 181 Swift Normalase® Amplicon Panels ( SNAP ) Workflow . Libraries were barcoded with 8bp unique 182 dual indices at the Indexing PCR . For library normalization , the 2 nM Normalase I protocol was 183 performed on libraries individually , followed by pooling 5 µl of each post - Normalase I library to 184 perform Normalase II reaction , which results in sequence ready library pool . Before sequencing , 185 the normalized library pool concentration was measured using qPCR with KAPA Library 186 Quantification Kits ( Roche , KK4835 , 07960204001 ) . 187 188 Illumina Sequencing . 189 The pooled SARS - CoV - 2 amplicon libraries were sequenced on Illumina NovaSeq 6000 S4 190 flowcell to generate 2x150bp reads . 191 192 Swift amplicon data analysis . 193 Swift amplicon data were analyzed using Swift Biosciences Sarscov2 analysis pipeline 194 ( https : / / github . com / swiftbiosciences / sarscov2analysis _ docker ) with minimum read coverage 195 depth of 3 . The GATK variants were next filtered with allele fraction > = 80 , and min read depth 196 30x 12 , 13 . Swift analysis pipeline produced variant vcf file , consensus genome , pangolin lineage 197 and Nextclade assignment ( https : / / clades . nextstrain . org / ) .
