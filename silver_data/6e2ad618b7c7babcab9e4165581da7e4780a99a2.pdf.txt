Keywords : Positive - strand RNA virus ; Nodavirus ; RNA genome replication complex ; Cryo - EM ; Crown complex 2 Abstract Positive - strand RNA viruses replicate their genomes in virus - induced membrane vesicles , and the resulting RNA replication complexes are a major target for virus control . Nodavirus studies first revealed viral RNA replication proteins forming a 12 - fold symmetric “crown” at the vesicle opening to the cytosol , an arrangement recently confirmed to extend to distantly related alphaviruses . Using cryo - electron microscopy ( cryo - EM ) , we show that mature nodavirus crowns comprise two stacked 12 - mer rings of multi - domain viral RNA replication protein A . Each ring contains an ~ 19 nm circle of C - proximal polymerase domains , differentiated by strikingly diverged positions of N - proximal RNA capping / membrane binding domains . The lower ring is a “proto - crown” precursor that assembles prior to RNA template recruitment , RNA synthesis and replication vesicle formation . In this proto - crown , the N - proximal segments interact to form a toroidal central floor , whose 3 . 1 Å resolution structure reveals many mechanistic details of the RNA capping / membrane binding domains . In the upper ring , cryo - EM fitting indicates that the N - proximal domains extend radially outside the polymerases , forming separated , membrane - binding “legs . ” The polymerase and N - proximal domains are connected by a long linker accommodating the conformational switch between the two rings and possibly also polymerase movements associated with RNA synthesis and non - symmetric electron density in the lower center of mature crowns . The results reveal remarkable viral protein multifunctionality , conformational flexibility and evolutionary plasticity and new insights into ( + ) RNA virus replication and control . Significance Positive - strand RNA viruses - including coronaviruses , alphaviruses , flaviviruses and many other medically and economically important pathogens - replicate their RNA genomes by virus - encoded machinery that has been poorly characterized . Using an advanced nodavirus model , we identify a major precursor in RNA replication complex assembly and show it to be a 12 - mer ring of viral RNA replication protein A , whose single particle cryo - EM structure reveals functional features of its membrane interaction , assembly , polymerase and RNA capping domains . We further show that fully functional RNA replication complexes acquire a second 12 - mer ring of protein A in alternate conformation atop the first , and a central density likely to represent another polymerase conformation . These findings provide strong foundations for understanding , controlling and beneficially using such viruses . 3 Introduction Positive - strand RNA ( ( + ) RNA ) viruses include many established and emerging pathogens such as coronaviruses , flaviviruses , the alphavirus - and picornavirus - like superfamilies and numerous others . These viruses reproduce their genomes through RNA intermediates ( Fig . 1A ) in membrane - bounded , organelle - like RNA replication complexes ( RC’s ) that organize RNA replication factors and templates , protect dsRNA replication intermediates from innate immune recognition and responses , and release new ( + ) RNA genomes for translation , further replication and encapsidation . The two known RC classes are ~ 50 - 150 nm spherular invaginations or spherules , and ~ 200 - 300 nm double membrane vesicles or DMVs ( 1 ) . One well - studied model for spherule RC structure and function is flock house virus ( FHV ) , best - studied member of the nodaviruses , which infect vertebrates or invertebrates ( 2 ) . FHV virions infect Drosophila and other insect cells , and contain a 4 . 5 kb genome divided between RNA1 and RNA2 ( Fig . 1B ) . Despite its small size , the transfected FHV genome directs RNA replication and virion production in cells from invertebrates , vertebrates , yeast and plants ( 3 , 4 ) . This small genome size , wide replicative competence and ribosomal RNA - level viral RNA yields make FHV a potentially valuable platform for engineered RNA replication . FHV genomic RNA1 encodes protein A , the sole viral protein required for RNA replication , which contains membrane interaction domains , a methyltransferase / guanylyltransferase ( MTase / GTase ) RNA capping domain , an “Iceberg” domain , and a C - proximal RNA - dependent RNA polymerase ( Pol ) domain ( Fig . 1B ) . These domains are conserved throughout the distantly related alphavirus - like superfamily of viruses ( 5 ) , which additionally preserve an NTPase / RNA helicase domain lacking in nodaviruses ( Fig . 1B ) . In particular , the N - terminal 452 amino acids ( aa ) of protein A , hereafter denoted segment A N , include the MTase - GTase and Iceberg domains and parallel the RNA capping and membrane binding functions of the nsP1 proteins of classical alphaviruses like chikungunya virus ( CHIKV ) ( Fig . 1B ) ( 5 , 6 ) . FHV protein A binds outer mitochondrial membranes ( OMMs ) and induces ~ 30 - 70 nm spherule invaginations ( 7 , 8 ) . Cryo - electron tomography ( cryo - ET ) of these nodavirus RCs visualized the dsRNA genome replication intermediates inside spherules and revealed that viral RNA replication protein A was localized in a striking 12 - fold symmetric ring , dubbed the crown , on the cytosolic side of the spherule neck ( Fig . 1C - D ) ( 9 ) . Further improvements resolved the major crown features ( Fig . 1D ) including an ~ 19 nm diameter central turret composed of 12 pairs of stacked apical and basal lobes , an inner toroidal floor , and legs projecting outward from the basal lobes , and showed by genetic tagging that each apical domain represents a protein A Pol domain ( 10 ) . Protein A is the sole FHV protein required to form full crowns indistinguishable from those in FHV - infected cells ( 11 ) . Recent results imply that similar crown - like complexes of viral RNA replication proteins play crucial roles in the RCs of many , if not most , ( + ) RNA viruses ( ( 1 , 10 , 12 ) and references therein ) . CHIKV nsP1 , which as noted above is related to protein A’s A N segment ( Fig . 1B ) ( 5 ) , assembles into a 12 - fold symmetric ring similar to the base of the nodavirus crown ( 13 , 14 ) . At even greater evolutionary distance , the double membrane vesicle ( DMV ) RCs of coronaviruses bear ring - shaped , viral nsp3 - containing crown complexes also providing entry and exit portals to the viral RNA - rich DMV interior ( 15 , 16 ) . Nodavirus RCs assemble through distinct , sequential states . In the absence of other viral components , protein A targets itself to OMMs ( 17 , 18 ) . Protein A specifically recognizes viral RNA templates and recruits them to the OMM ( 18 , 19 ) , then synthesizes ( - ) RNA and captures the resulting dsRNA product in an RC vesicle newly invaginated on the OMM ( 20 ) . When trapped on OMMs in its pre - RNA synthesis state by polymerase mutation or absence of a replicable FHV RNA template , protein A fails to induce RNA replication vesicles and causes extensive , close zippering of adjacent mitochondria ( 20 ) . The spaces between such zippered mitochondria contain regular OMM - linked structures with ~ 20 nm periodicity ( 20 ) . Thus , prior to RNA synthesis , protein A induces 4 OMM - linked complexes with dimensions similar to the mature crowns of active RCs , but with dramatically different interaction properties . Here we show that , prior to RNA replication , protein A initially assembles on OMMs in a 12 - mer ring corresponding to the basal lobe ring and floor of the mature , RNA replication - active crown . The single - particle cryo - EM structure of this proto - crown precursor shows that the A N segments form the floor . The MTase - GTase and a central 𝛼 - helical bundle share structural similarities to CHIKV nsP1 while their orientations and membrane interaction domains differ from nsP1 . The Pol domain resides atop the outer edge of the A N floor , in the position corresponding to the full crown basal lobes . The Pol structure fits similarly well into the full crown apical lobes , confirming prior results , and the A N structure also fits well into the full crown legs . The results thus indicate that the mature crown consists of two sequentially added , stacked 12 - mer rings of protein A in distinct conformations . A long , flexible linker connecting A N and Pol , a Pol - like density centered in the mature crown floor , and implications for crown assembly , function and evolution are also discussed . Results Protein A alone forms “proto - crowns” As noted in the Introduction , when nodavirus RNA replication is blocked by omitting the RNA template or mutating the template or Pol active site , protein A assembles on OMMs in ordered arrangements with interactive properties distinct from the crowns of full FHV infection ( 20 ) . To determine the structure of these “pre - replication” protein A assemblies , we used recombinant baculoviruses AcR1 and AcR1Δ3’ , kindly provided by Dr . Anette Schneemann ( 21 ) . Upon infecting Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 cells , AcR1 expresses FHV genomic RNA1 and drives robust RNA1 replication as shown by replication - dependent production of subgenomic RNA3 and its translation product protein B2 ( Fig . 2A ) . AcR1Δ3’ expresses an FHV RNA1 - derivative lacking the 3’ untranslated region required for genomic RNA1 replication and subgenomic RNA3 production . Accordingly , this RNA1 derivative translated full - length protein A but did not produce RNA replication - dependent RNA3 or its translation product B2 ( Fig . 2A ) . Due to the high expression normally achieved with baculovirus vectors , even without RNA1 replication the protein A level in AcR1Δ3’ - infected cells matched that in AcR1 - infected cells . Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that most AcR1 - and AcR1Δ3’ - inoculated cells were baculovirus - infected and produced protein A , but dsRNA staining was only observed In cells infected by AcR1 and not AcR1Δ3’ ( Fig . S1 ) . The RNA replication defect of AcR1Δ3’ was rescued by transfecting a plasmid expressing a replicable RNA1 template , RNA1fs , that contains a frameshift mutation early in the protein A coding region and depends on independently expressed protein A for its replication ( Fig . 2A ) . Thus , AcR1Δ3’ - expressed protein A was fully capable of supporting RNA synthesis . To compare the protein A state before and during RNA replication , mitochondria from AcR1 - and AcR1Δ3’ - infected cells were plunge - frozen and imaged by cryo - ET . As shown in Fig , 2B , AcR1 induced mitochondrial RNA replication vesicles equivalent to those in FHV - infected Drosophila cells , with a high density of replication vesicles in the expanded lumen beneath the OMM , and crown - like densities at the vesicle necks . In contrast , AcR1Δ3’ , expressing protein A without RNA replication , did not induce vesicles ( Fig . 2C ) . OMM in AcR1Δ3’ - infected cells bore numerous crown - like densities ( Fig . 2C ) not seen in mock - infected Sf9 mitochondria ( Fig . S2 ) . Top views showed that these densities were rings whose diameter and overall appearance were similar to the central turret of active 12 - mer FHV replication crowns ( Fig . 2B - C , lower panels ) . However , AcR1Δ3’ - induced rings lacked the outward leg extensions of full RNA replication crowns and thereby clustered more tightly . Thus , in the absence of RNA replication , protein A forms ringed structures that are similar but not identical to FHV crowns , and without the accompanying membrane rearrangements . S ubtomogram averaging of 3001 RNA replication - active crowns on mitochondria from AcR1 - infected cells produced an ~ 17 Å resolution structure ( Fig . 3A and Fig . S3A ) . The resulting AcR1 crown was indistinguishable 5 from RC crowns from FHV - infected cells ( 10 ) , with a cross - correlation score of 0 . 977 ( 22 ) . Thus , baculovirus expression recapitulates FHV RNA replication in structure and function . Parallel subtomogram averaging of 1685 RNA replication - inactive , crown - like particles on mitochondria from AcR1Δ3’ - infected cells yielded an ~ 13 Å resolution structure of a short , leg - less crown - like structure with intrinsic 12 - fold symmetry , hereafter designated the “proto - crown” ( Fig . 3D and Fig . S3B ) . These pre - replication proto - crowns from AcR1Δ3’ - infected Sf9 cells are markedly distinct from RNA replication - active crowns from FHV - infected Drosophila cells ( Fig . 1D ) and baculovirus AcR1 - infected Sf9 cells ( Fig . 3A ) . While preserving a 12 - fold ring of subunits , the proto - crown is approximately half as tall as the mature crown and corresponds closely to the central lower portion of the mature full replication crown ( Fig . 3B , movie S1 ) . This includes the basal lobe ring and the floor , but not the outward - projecting legs and apical lobe ring of replication - active crowns , which are thus revealed as the distinct upper half of the mature crown ( Fig . 3B - C ) . Furthermore , while the membrane under replication - active crowns curves into the semi - toroidal neck of the replication vesicle , the OMM surface below the proto - crown remains flat and unperturbed ( black outlines in Fig . 3C ) . Single particle cryo - EM reveals proto - crown protein A structure For single particle cryo - EM analysis , we used mild cross - linking ( 23 – 26 ) and detergent to solubilize proto - crowns from mitochondria isolated from Sf9 cells infected with a baculovirus expressing C - terminally alfa - tagged protein A ( Ac - FHVptnA - alfa ) ( Fig . S4 ) . Interestingly , equivalent treatment of mitochondria from S2 cells infected with a fully infectious FHV - derivative with a C - terminally alfa - tagged protein A , while bearing larger mature crowns and spherules , also yielded proto - crowns upon solubilization ( Fig . S5 ) . 2D classification showed that proto - crowns from FHV infection were 12 - mer rings ( Fig . S5 ) , as expected , while proto - crowns from baculovirus - expressed protein A contained 12 - mer and 11 - mer rings , with C11 symmetry predominating ( Fig . S4 ) . Independent single particle analysis was conducted on C12 and C11 proto - crowns from baculovirus expression of protein A . The structures of the underlying 12 - and 11 - fold monomers did not reveal any significant differences . Fig . 4 presents the electron density , ribbon diagram and surface electrostatic maps of the C12 proto - crown protein A structure . Available data indicate that C12 is the native conformation of protein A on mitochondria prior to detergent solubilization . Cryo - ET shows that OMM - linked crowns and proto - crowns have C12 symmetry , while C11 assemblies have not been detected , including by 3D classification and rotational symmetry analysis ( ( 9 , 10 ) and this study , Fig . 3 ) . This is functionally significant since FHV RCs on isolated mitochondria remain highly active for RNA synthesis ( ( 6 , 7 ) and unpublished results ) ) . CHIKV nsP1 , which is distantly related to the N - proximal half of protein A , also forms C12 rings ( 13 , 14 ) . Ongoing studies will examine if C11 protein A assemblies have any natural role in FHV replication or are an artifact of detergent treatment . The single particle structure of the solubilized proto - crown docks precisely into the tomographic density envelopes of the mitochondrially attached proto - crown and mature crown lower central section , confirming preservation of its OMM - inserted state ( Fig . 5A ) . As detailed further below , the repeated subunits consist of a floor domain comprising the N - proximal A N segment of protein A , surmounted at its outer edge by the C - proximal protein A Pol domain ( Fig . 1A and 4 ) . The floor conformation was well maintained between proto - crowns , yielding a floor resolution of 3 . 1 Å ( C11 ) to 3 . 2 Å ( C12 ) . This toroidal floor is nearly flat with outer and inner diameters of 19 and 7 nm and , as shown in Fig . 4B , consists from exterior to interior of three domains : a membrane interaction domain ( purple ) , MTase / GTase RNA capping domain ( yellow ) , and central ring with a three - strand β sheet and a bundle of three 𝛼 helices ( red ) . The Pol domain is more flexible ( see below ) but presents a typical polymerase fold . Overall , of the 998 aa protein A sequence , an atomic model could be built into the density from aa 55 - 869 . C - terminal aa 897 - 998 are required for RNA replication but predicted to be disordered ( 27 ) . Like other disordered regions , including the alphavirus nsP3 C terminus ( 28 ) , this region may bind host or viral proteins or participate in other regulatory interactions ( 29 ) . A few internal loops are also disordered as noted below . The following sections present the structure and mechanistic implications of the proto - crown’s functional domains in more detail . 6 MTase / GTase structure and orientation in crown Nodavirus RNAs bear 5’ m 7 Gppp caps and advanced protein sequence comparisons showed that protein A’s N - proximal region is distantly related to MTase - GTase RNA capping enzymes of the alphavirus superfamily ( 5 ) . Our results confirm and extend this conclusion by showing that , despite extreme primary sequence divergence ( 5 , 6 ) , protein A aa 91 - 282 ( Fig . 4B , yellow region of floor ) fold into a structure highly similar to the CHIKV nsP1 MTase - GTase ( 13 , 14 ) , including a core six - strand β - sheet flanked by two 𝛼 - helices and another four - strand β - sheet ( Fig . 5B - C and Movie S2 ) . Many of these structural similarities extend to the GTP N7 MTases of vaccinia virus , African swine fever virus , humans and fungal pathogen E . cuniculi ( Movie S3 ) . The binding sites in protein A for GTP and the S - adenosyl homocysteine ( SAH ) byproduct of methyl donor S - adenosyl methionine ( SAM ) were inferred from superposition with the known structures of CHIKV nsP1 bound to SAH and 7 - Methyl - guanosine - 5 ' - monophosphate ( m 7 GMP ) ( PDB : 7FGH , ( 30 ) ) and E . cuniculi MTase bound to SAH and GTP ( 31 ) and refined by molecular dynamics simulation ( Fig . 5D ) ( 13 , 14 ) . The GTP N7 position is 5 Å from the SAH sulfur atom . However , the GTP α phosphate is 16 Å from the GMP acceptor site H93 ( 5 , 6 ) . Similar to CHIKV nsP1 ( 13 , 14 ) , these results imply that the protein A structure visualized corresponds to a MTase - active form while GTase function must involve significant GTP or protein movement , possibly facilitated by GTP’s position near an intersubunit interface . While the FHV and CHIKV MTase / GTase domains share a common fold and similar GTP and SAM / SAH substrate binding sites , they differ dramatically in orientation within their respective crowns ( Fig . 5A - B ) . The FHV proto - crown floor within which the MTase / GTase resides is essentially flat and parallel to its underlying membrane , while the corresponding CHIKV nsP1 ring is a cone expanding away from the membrane ( Fig . 5A - B ) . As shown in Movie S2 , these orientation differences correspond to a 52° rotation of the MTase - GTase domain in nsP1 relative to protein A . Whether this difference affects the exit path of 5’ capped nascent RNA from the crown remains to be determined . As noted below , the FHV and CHIKV MTase / GTase domains also differ in the position and nature of their flanking membrane - interaction domains . Conserved Central Ring and Diverged Membrane Interactions The protein A sequence C - proximal to the MTase / GTase domain folds into a three - strand β - sheet followed by a bundle of three 𝛼 - helices , which form the central ring of the proto - crown floor , bounding the 7 nm diameter channel through which RNA templates , products and nucleotides must be transported ( red segment in Fig . 4B and 5 and Movie S2 ) . The latter two β - strands and the 𝛼 - helical bundle are conserved with CHIKV nsP1 ( Fig . 5E ) and conserve a few residues in similar positions . In both protein A and nsP1 the helical bundles form the central ring of the 12 - mer ( Fig . 5A ) , although their precise orientation relative to the central axis differs by a 42° rotation ( Movie S2 ) . While the β - sheet / three helix bundle motif is conserved between protein A and nsP1 , the sequences following differ significantly . The protein A sequence forms a long linker that , as discussed in the next section , runs toward the outside of the proto - crown and curves upward to eventually connect with the C - proximal polymerase domain ( Fig . 5E ) . By contrast , in nsP1 the last 𝛼 helix of the bundle is extended downward toward the spherule interior by 12 aa ( nsp1 aa 393 - 404 ) to anchor a membrane - binding loop ( Fig . 5E ) . This loop hooks around another membrane interaction loop inserted in the MTase / GTase domain of the adjacent nsP1 , contributing to crown oligomerization and jointly forming an amphipathic unit that inserts into the membrane ( 13 , 14 ) . Protein A interacts with the OMM through sequences distinct from nsP1 in position and nature , involving the N terminus ( aa 1 - 67 ) and an insertion ( aa 233 - 250 ) between two β - strands in the MTase / GTase . The latter insertion and N - proximal aa 55 - 67 each form an amphipathic helix under the outermost section of the floor . Both interact strongly with detergent in the solubilized proto - crown ( Fig . S4 ) . Similarly , modeling the protein A structure into the cryo - ET proto - crown and mature crown density maps shows both amphipathic helices interacting with the 7 upper leaflet of the OMM ( Fig . 5A , purple helices ) . Amino acids 1 - 54 were not visualized , but prior studies show that aa 15 - 36 are the most hydrophobic segment in protein A and act as a trans - membrane domain , localizing the protein A N - terminus to the mitochondrial intermembrane space , and that aa 1 - 46 are sufficient for mitochondrial targeting and membrane binding ( 17 ) . Pol linker and floor subunit interactions Between the three - helix bundle forming the floor central ring and the polymerase domain In protein A is an ~ 74 aa linker ( aa 379 - 452 ) . The first 18 aa ( aa 379 - 396 ) are structurally well defined ( Fig . 6 ) . From the last helix of the bundle , this sequence extends under the MTase - GTase floor ~ 2 . 3 nm toward the outside of the proto - crown , then turns upward between adjacent protein subunits to near the top of the floor and base of the polymerase ( Fig . 6 ) . In this interface , this 18 aa segment provides bridging interactions to both adjoining subunits , including hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions . As analyzed by the PISA server ( 32 ) , the interface between two adjacent floor subunits has an area of ~ 1804 Å 2 and a solvation free energy of ~ - 21 kcal / mol . Viewed from the outside of the proto - crown ( Fig . 4A - B ) , the interaction involves 46 residues from the left subunit and 56 residues from the right subunit , and includes 7 hydrogen bonds . Of the 46 interacting residues from the left subunit , 17 are within the polymerase linker , which thus contributes significantly to stabilizing floor assembly and might be a controlling factor in that process . In contrast to the initial 18 aa’s strong participation in floor interactions , essentially all of the remaining Pol linker ( aa 397 - 445 ) is too flexible to build definitively . Because of the ~ 27 nm potential length of this missing sequence , further studies are needed to determine if each floor domain connects with the Pol domain immediately above it as a vertical subunit , or with a Pol domain to either side in a helical array . Possible further contributions of the missing linker sequences to Pol flexibility and regulation are considered below . Polymerase ( Pol ) Structure The Pol domain was visible from its N - terminus ( aa 453 ) , but with significantly lower resolution than the floor , becoming increasingly lower in resolution with increasing distance from the floor . Our 3D classification results indicate that the Pol domains can pivot on their contact with the floor segment below , tilting forward and backward ~ 5° relative to the crown’s central axis , and have inherent flexibility in their internal subdomains ( Movie S4 ) . This is similar to the highly dynamic nature of some alphavirus RNA polymerases , such as that of Ross River virus , which also possess multiple internal flexible domains ( 33 ) . To improve the Pol density , we used symmetry expansion with density subtraction in cis TEM to isolate and individually refine the Pol structure ( 34 , 35 ) . We found that isolating two adjacent Pol domains for focused refinement gave the best density improvement and provided a map that , combined with the structure predicted by AlphaFold 2 ( 36 ) , allowed generating a backbone trace missing the last 35 aa of the Pol domain and covering 80 % of the remainder ( missing aa 487 - 533 , 630 - 53 and 816 - 28 ) . From its N - terminus at the bottom , adjacent to the floor , Pol folds generally upward to its C - terminus near the exposed top ( Fig . 4B , 5A , 7A ) . Similar to other polymerases , FHV Pol has a typical “right - hand” fold with fingers , palm and thumb subdomains cupped toward the proto - crown interior ( Fig . 4B , 7A ) . In keeping with our prior analysis ( 10 ) , the DALI protein - structure comparison server ( 37 ) identified the best Pol match among known structures as Dengue flavivirus ( DENV ) NS5 polymerase , while the best match among alphaviruses was the Sindbis virus nsP4 polymerase ( Fig . 8B - C ) . Thus , FHV stands as an intermediate between two important families of human and animal viruses , with an alphavirus - like RNA capping domain and flavivirus pol domain . Upper mature crown represents an alternate protein A conformation Having found that the proto - crown constitutes the basal lobes and floor of the mature crown ( Fig . 3B - C ) and represents 12 copies of protein A ( Fig . 4 ) , we re - examined the remaining portions of the mature crown , i . e . , the apical lobe ring and legs ( Fig . 3AB ) . Previously we used cryo - EM visualization of a genetically inserted tag to show that the 12 apical lobes are copies of protein A’s C - proximal Pol domain ( 10 ) . Thus , the full crown’s apical and 8 basal lobe rings are stacked polymerase domains , explaining their uniform diameter . Comparing the single particle - derived Pol model to a full crown reconstruction from our prior mature FHV crown cryo - ET data ( 10 ) confirms that the the apical and basal lobe densities are highly similar , equivalently oriented in their respective rings and each fit the proto - crown Pol ribbon diagram well ( Fig . 8A ) . We next considered if the apical lobe Pol domains , like their basal lobe proto - crown counterparts , were linked to other portions of full - length protein A . Unlike many ( + ) RNA viruses , FHV does not encode a protease domain and proteolytic processing of protein A has never been reported ( 2 ) . To further define the state of protein A , we performed western blotting on total protein samples from Drosophila S2 cells infected with the same engineered FHV derivative used in our single particle cryo - EM proto - crown studies , bearing an alfa - tag fused to protein A’s C terminus . To better examine the full protein , parallel western blots were performed with an antibody against the C - terminal alfa - tag , a monoclonal antibody against N - proximal protein A aa 99 - 230 , and a polyclonal anti - protein A antibody that recognizes the polymerase domain ( Fig . S6 ) , presumably as well as other protein A epitopes . To identify FHV - specific bands vs . cross - reactive host bands and to estimate the relative levels of minor FHV bands , the FHV - infected cell extract was progressively diluted with uninfected cell extract . The results confirm that > 95 % of protein A - derived species in infected cells are full length ( 112 kDa ) . Minor species of ~ 85 , ~ 77 and ~ 45 kDa were visualized with the Pol - reactive polyclonal and anti - alfa - tag antibodies , but the signal for each was much less than 5 % of the full - length protein A signal . Thus , since > 95 % of protein A in infected cells is membrane associated , predominantly in the form of crowns ( 10 ) , at least 90 % of the apical Pol domains in mature crowns must be linked to protein A’s N - proximal segment A N ( aa 1 - 452 ) . However , since the apical Pol ring lacks a central floor like that formed by the N - terminal segments linked to the basal , proto - crown Pol ring , the apical A N segments must be in a distinct arrangement . These upper A N segments must be repeated 12 times per crown and , from the results above , should have individual volumes of ~ 30 nm 3 , be linked at one end to the apical polymerase base within the range of the Pol linker and at the other end linked to the OMM . These characteristics exactly match the features of the only remaining portion of the mature crown , the legs ( Fig . 8B ) . The 12 legs each begin just below an apical Pol domain at a distance from the estimated Pol sequence N - terminus of ~ 6 nm , which is close to the length of the built region of the linker ( Fig . 6 ) and much less than the potential ~ 27 nm length of the full linker ( aa 379 - 452 ) if unfolded ( 38 ) . The estimated cryo - ET density volume of each leg is ~ 25 nm 3 . At its distal end , each leg interacts with the curved OMM in a fashion similar to the exterior edge of each floor segment ( Fig . 5A and 8B ) . Moreover , rigid body fitting in ChimeraX shows that the A N floor ribbon diagram from the proto - crown structure fits the cryo - ET leg density as well as the cryo - ET floor segment , and correctly positions the helical bundle start of the NTH - Pol linker at the leg’s interior end and the membrane - interacting helices at the leg’s distal membrane contact site ( Fig . 8B ) . These extensive matching features and the absence of any alternate , unaccounted crown density , in combination with the fact that protein A is the only viral protein required to reproduce the full structure of mature crowns from full FHV infections ( 11 ) , strongly implicate the legs as the A N segments that must be connected with the apical Pol segments . Due to the flexibility and potential length of the linker sequence between A N and Pol , more study is needed to determine if each leg connects with the apical lobe Pol immediately above it or to one side ( Fig . 8 ) . The Fig . 8B superposition implies that the leg represents the A N segment with relatively little core conformational rearrangement from the floor segment . Accordingly , relative to the floor segment , the leg is translated ~ 7 . 1 nm radially and , when viewed from outside the ring , rotated ~ 52° clockwise along a largely radial axis . Again , consistent with the flexibility of the Pol linker , the leg is also translated ~ 1 . 3 nm downward from the bottom of the apical Pol to interact with the adjacent basal Pol near its product RNA exit site . Electron density in the crown central channel As we noted previously , the Pol domains in the central turret ( Fig . 8A ) appear inconsistent with ( + ) RNA synthesis , due to their physical separation from the dsRNA template beneath the crown floor and other issues . Rather , the 9 requirements of ( + ) RNA synthesis appear to demand an alternate state of protein A near the 7 nm central channel of the crown floor to access the viral dsRNA template inside the spherule ( 1 , 10 ) . In keeping with this , strong electron density spanning the central channel of the mature crown floor has been consistently observed in all cryo - EM studies of replication - active nodavirus crowns ( ( 9 – 11 ) and this paper ) . To better examine this density , we locally refined the inner central ring region of the floor of cryo - ET - imaged crowns from FHV - infected cells without imposed symmetry . Fig . 9 shows this refined central density , and its asymmetric contacts with the inner ring of the floor , within the sub - tomogram average of the full , mature crown also with no imposed symmetry . The estimated 41 nm 3 volume of this central density appears reasonably consistent with the ~ 44 nm 3 volume of individual Pol domains in the basal and apical rings , particularly considering their relatively low resolution . Possible origins of this density are considered further in the Discussion . Discussion The results presented here show that the full , mature nodavirus RNA replication crown is a 24 - mer of protein A in two distinct conformations . Twelve copies of protein A constitute a lower , proto - crown precursor that forms on the OMM when protein A is expressed alone , in the absence of a replicable RNA template ( Fig . 3 and 4 ) . Active RCs functional for repeated ( + ) RNA synthesis , the major job of RNA replication , always possess a second 12 - mer ring of protein A in a distinct conformation above and surrounding the proto - crown ( Fig . 3 and 8 ) , as well as an invaginated spherule vesicle containing a viral dsRNA template ( Fig . 2B ) . Forming nodavirus RNA replication vesicles requires protein A , a functional RNA template and RNA synthesis ( 20 ) , suggesting that the vesicle is generated by being filled with the dsRNA product of ( - ) RNA synthesis ( 9 , 12 ) . The resulting replication vesicle , pressurized by negatively charged dsRNA , is held together at the neck by the mature crown , which depends on its dual rings of membrane interaction sites in the upper crown legs as well as the lower proto - crown floor to closely constrain and stabilize the curved membrane neck ( Fig . 3A and ( 10 ) ) . Thus , ( - ) RNA synthesis , invaginating the spherule replication vesicle and maturing the pre - replication proto - crown to the full double ring crown are closely linked events , and possibly also closely linked to recruiting the founding ( + ) RNA template for ( - ) RNA synthesis . Determining the precise order and interrelation of these steps will be highly informative . Below we discuss further aspects of the nodavirus crown structure , mechanistic implications of these features for RNA replication , and broader implications for ( + ) RNA viruses . Extended Pol linker and central channel electron density A surprising feature of the protein A structure is the 74 aa sequence ( aa 379 - 452 ) linking the floor’s central ring to Pol . In the proto - crown , the initial 18 aa of this sequence ( aa 379 - 396 ) form a well - defined elbow that reaches from the three - helix bundle of the central ring to near the base of Pol and contributes significantly to the inter - subunit interactions that assemble the proto - crown floor ( Fig . 6 ) . Re - positioning this connecting sequence when segment A N shifts relative to Pol between its multimerized inner floor assembly and separated outer leg positions ( Fig . 8 ) might be coupled to dissolving the floor interactions . Although this elbow reaches within ~ 2 nm of the Pol start domain in the proto - crown structure , there remain 56 aa ( aa 397 - 452 ) of primary sequence between the elbow’s end and Pol start . This additional linker sequence was too flexible to resolve in the structure and , if extended , could stretch over 22 nm , greatly exceeding the ~ 7 nm movement of A N relative to Pol between its proto - crown floor and upper crown leg positions ( Fig . 8 ) . In principle , this flexible linker might support Pol movement anywhere within the crown for ( + ) RNA synthesis , ( - ) RNA synthesis or other steps . Fig . 9 shows that in mature nodavirus crowns active in ( + ) RNA synthesis , the crown floor’s central channel is occupied by an asymmetric electron density with a volume similar to the protein A Pol domain . This central 10 density has been visualized in all previous cryo - ET reconstructions of mature crowns from FHV - infected cells ( 9 – 11 ) , and was present in all 3D classes of mature crowns obtained in the current analysis . This is of considerable interest since the 24 Pol domains of the central turret ( Fig . 8A ) are blocked by the crown floor from accessing the spherule - protected dsRNA template , and therefore incompatible with ( + ) RNA synthesis . These considerations implied that crowns must contain another form of Pol with direct access to the dsRNA ( 1 , 10 , 12 ) , which a Pol in the central channel would provide . As summarized in the next section , emerging results on CHIKV crowns strongly support this hypothesis . A Pol domain might be recruited to the central channel in at least two ways . First , a single Pol domain in the apical or basal ring might disengage and , flexibly tethered by the long Pol linker , bend down to engage the central channel . Consistent with this , Pol variability in our 3D classification ( see Results and Movie S4 ) shows that these domains are not strongly bound in the central turret . Initial efforts to search for crowns that might be missing one or more apical or basal Pol domains have been inconclusive to date , and efforts in this area are ongoing . The central channel density might alternatively represent a 25 th Pol in the crown . Such a 25 th Pol might be a rare independent Pol processed away from other protein A segments ( Fig . S6 ) or part of a full - length protein A . A 25 th full length protein A might have the A N membrane interaction domains neutralized by presently unknown interactions or utilize the long , flexible linker between A N and Pol to interact with the spherule membrane below the crown floor . Beyond ( + ) RNA synthesis and in addition to their structural roles , the Pol domains in the proto - crown or mature crown central turrets likely function in other required Pol functions , including RNA template recruitment and ( - ) RNA synthesis ( 2 , 19 , 20 ) , and possibly bridging interactions to downstream processes like translation and encapsidation ( see next section ) . Relation to alphavirus RNA replication complexes While this report was in final preparation , a manuscript uploaded to bioRxiv presented further results on CHIKV RNA replication protein structure , interaction and relation to cryo - ET images of in vivo RCs ( 39 ) . This included the single particle cryo - EM structure of an nsP1 + nsP2 + nsP4 complex , comprising one copy of nsP4 polymerase bound to the central pore of the nsP1 12 - mer ring ( Fig . 5A ) , with one nsP2 helicase domain bound to the cytosolic side of nsP4 . This nsP1 + nsP2 + nsP4 complex fit well into the membrane - proximal ~ 7 nm portion of ~ 17 nm tall cryo - ET - imaged crowns at the necks of spherule RNA RCs in CHIKV - infected cells ( 39 ) . The composition of the upper , cytosol - facing , 12 - fold symmetric ~ 10 nm of these crowns was not defined but was suggested to include CHIKV RNA replication factor nsP3 and possibly host factors . In addition to 17 nm tall crowns on full RCs , late - stage infected cells contained shorter crown - like rings that appeared to correspond to the nsP1 + nsP2 + nsP4 complex alone , which were always found on flat membranes lacking spherule invaginations and their dsRNA contents . These alphavirus findings show striking parallels with the nodavirus results reported here , including multi - stage assembly of the RNA replication crown by stacking distinct 12 - fold symmetric protein rings . Prior to RNA synthesis , both viruses first assemble single ring precursors on flat membranes , and then mature these into active RCs by invaginating membrane spherules filled with dsRNA and adding a further , membrane - distal protein layer to the crown precursor . Nodaviruses and alphaviruses both require viral RNA synthesis for membrane spherule formation ( 9 , 20 , 40 ) , and current and prior nodavirus results further document that the crown assembly transition revealed here from proto - crown precursor to replication - active mature crown is triggered by RNA template availability ( Fig . 2 - 3 ) . Potential broad significance for this RNA - activated assembly transition is supported by parallels with an RNA - dependent RNA polymerase extract from brome mosaic virus ( BMV ) , an alphavirus superfamily member with RNA replication proteins related to CHIKV nsP1 , 2 and 4 . This detergent - solubilized BMV polymerase complex lacks functional endogenous RNA templates and requires in vitro - supplied viral RNA templates . Nevertheless , template - dependent polymerase activity can only be isolated from cells expressing viral RNA replication proteins plus a viral 11 RNA template ; cells lacking an RNA template yield extracts with the same complement of viral proteins but no activity on added templates ( 41 ) . Thus , without a functional template , replication proteins fail to complete assembly to an active state . Conservation of multiple key principles of RC structure , assembly and function between nodaviruses and alphaviruses is particularly notable given the considerable evolutionary distance between their RNA replication proteins , which are dramatically diverged in size , complexity , expression strategy and sequence ( Fig . 1A and ( 5 ) ) . Preservation of these common features thus implies that the underlying RNA replication principles are ancient and likely to extend to other ( + ) RNA viruses . Flaviviruses , e . g . , also form spherule RCs ( 42 , 43 ) that might embody at least some of these features , particularly since the protein A structure reveals FHV as a missing link encoding an alphavirus - like MTase - GTase and a flavivirus - like polymerase ( Fig . 5 and 7 ) . Moreover , despite even greater evolutionary differences , coronaviruses also form membrane - spanning multimeric crowns that channel release of progeny RNAs to the cytosol ( 1 , 10 , 15 , 16 ) . The crown and RC features revealed here also underscore and further illuminate multiple parallels with the replicative cores of dsRNA virus and retrovirus virions ( 1 ) . Complementing the conserved noda - and alphavirus features are differences revealing spherule operational flexibilities . While conserving their core structure and 12 - mer assembly , e . g . , the MTase - GTase and central ring domains differ in structure and attachment points of their membrane interaction domains ( Fig . 5 ) and assemble into a flat floor for protein A and a cone in nsP1 ( Fig . 5A - B ) . Also intriguing is the absence in nodaviruses of the NTPase / helicase domain conserved across the alphavirus - like superfamily ( Fig . 1 ) , where it is required for viral template RNA recognition and recruitment , ongoing synthesis of ( + ) , ( - ) and subgenomic RNAs , and 5’ RNA triphosphatase activity in RNA capping ( 44 – 46 ) . To provide corresponding functions , nodaviruses might recruit one or more host proteins . Since nearly all cryo - ET crown density is assigned to protein A ( Fig . 8 ) , any such host protein ( s ) presumably would be in low copy number relative to protein A , and might contribute partially to the asymmetric density in the floor central channel ( Fig ; 8 ) . Alternatively , some helicase functions might be replaced by polymerase dsRNA unwinding activity ( 47 ) or unconventional activities of other protein A domains . Overall , the ability of the single , 998 aa FHV protein A to provide varied structural and functional roles paralleling those of the 2474 aa of CHIKV nsP1 + 2 + 3 + 4 within multi - layered crowns is a telling example of viral protein multifunctionality and plasticity . Further studies should illuminate the elegant adaptations , including protein A’s alternate conformational modes and likely its flexible Pol linker , that allow nodaviruses to utilize their unusually small and simple genomes with great evolutionary success . Among many novel questions posed by the results presented here are the functions of the mature crown upper ring . Possibilities include shielding RNA replication processes , templates and intermediates from innate immune recognition , assisting transfer of RNA products into translation and encapsidation , and providing a reaction chamber to facilitate RNA capping by regulating the rate and path of nascent product release . The proto - crown and crown structures reported here provide important foundations for addressing these and other crucial questions that should greatly enhance understanding and control of ( + ) RNA viruses . 12 Materials & Methods Detailed descriptions of cell culture , viruses , infections , transfections , RNA and protein analysis , immunofluorescence and cryo - EM are provided as Supporting Information .

Subgenomic RNA3 , transcribed from RNA1 , encodes RNAi suppressor B2 and an over - lapping ORF B1 , comprising the C - terminal 102 aa of protein A . Aligning FHV protein A and the alphavirus RNA replication polyprotein highlights conserved RNA capping and polymerase domains and FHV’s lack of helicase and protease domains . The N - terminal half of protein A , denoted segment A N , and alphavirus nsP1 show particu - lar parallels .

( A ) Northern and western blots of Nodavirus RNAs and proteins in Sf9 cells at 48 hours post - infection with baculo - viruses AcR1 or AcR1∆3’ at an m . o . i . of 20 . AcR1 launches wt RNA1 that self - replicates through cis - recognition by its product replicase protein A and produces subgenomic RNA3 and its translation product protein B2 . AcR1∆3’ , lacking the RNA1 3’ noncoding region , fails to launch self - replicating RNA1 , but its expressed protein A supports replication of a trans - supplied RNA1 derivative ( RNA1fs ) unable to produce protein A due to an N - proximal frame - shift . The FHV RNA probe also detects the primary mRNA transcript expressed from the baculovirus DNA genome and a regularly - observed virus - specific RNA species roughly twice the size of sgRNA3 ( asterisk ) . ( B ) Cryo - ET imaging shows that AcR1 - launched wt FHV RNA1 induces active RNA replication complexes bearing spherule membrane vesicles and mature crowns , while ( C ) AcR1∆3’ - expressed protein A , lacking a functional template RNA , forms crown - like structures on the OMM but no replication vesicles . Arrowheads : black = OMM , white = inner mitochondrial membrane ( IMM ) , red = RC vesicle , yellow = crown - like structures . Higher magnifica - tion top views of the OMM show AcR1 - induced crowns with leg - like extensions ( yellow arrowheads ) , and “leg - less” and more tightly packed ( white arrowheads ) AcR1∆3’ crowns .

Structure of the nodavirus protein A proto - crown and selected comparisons to alphavirus nsP1 . These and other zoomed - in views in figures below were taken from the highest resolution protein A structure obtained , which was the baculovirus - expressed C11 ring , but as noted in the Results no significant variations were detected between C11 and C12 subunit structures . ( A ) Fit of the atomic build of the FHV proto - crown in central cross - sections of the cryo - ET densities of the mature replication crown and the proto - crown ( left side ) and atomic build of the chikungunya virus ( CHIKV ) nsP1 crown ( right side ) ( 12 ) . Overlaying light gray segmentations define the outer mitochondrial membrane ( OMM ) for the FHV crowns ; positioning of the CHIKV crown on the plasma - membrane ( PM ) is inferred from detergent - belt in the published structure . Color coding is as defined in the legend to Figure 4B . ( B ) 12 copies of the N - terminal half of FHV protein A ( segment A N , aa 1 - 452 ) form a flat floor in the mature crown and the proto - crown , while the equivalent CHIKV nsP1 forms a cone - shaped crown . ( C ) Superposition of the capping domains of FHV protein A ( yellow ) and CHIKV nsP1 ( cyan ) . The close superposi - tion of FHV and CHIKV capping and central channel domains and their distinct orientations in their respective crowns is further illustrated in Supplementary Movie S3 . ( D ) Positions of S - Adenosyl - L - homocysteine ( SAH ) and GTP in the capping domain ( yellow ) of the FHV proto - crown floor were estimated based on superposition of the FHV protein A structural elements on the published CHIKV nsP1 - ligand interacting structures and fungal pathogen E . cuniculi . The SAM / SAH binding site is composed of R100 , R104 , N122 , and V162 , while D161 , Y165 , P186 , W215 , R271 bind GTP .

Side - and top - views of the FHV protein A central ring domain ( red ) including an 18 aa linker loop ( green ) , super - imposed on the CHIKV nsP1 RAMBO domain ( cyan ) . Three central helical bundles ( α1 , α2 , and α3 ) are sandwiched between 2 conserved upstream beta strands ( β1 and β2 ) and the downstream polymerase linker in FHV protein A , whereas in CHIKV nsP1 , the central helical bundles ( α1 , α2 , and α3 ) are connected with 2 upstream beta strands ( β1 and β2 ) followed by a membrane - binding loop ( MB Loop , purple ) .

Domain assignment in the upper mature crown . ( A ) Superposition of the Pol ribbon diagram with both lobes of the central turret of the mature crown cryo - ET density , consistent with independent identification of these apical ( 10 ) and basal ( Fig . 3 - 5 ) lobes as stacked Pol domains . ( B ) As shown in Fig . 3 - 5 and matching the A N ribbon diagram superposition shown , the 12 floor segments ( green ) are the N - proximal A N portions of protein A ( aa 1 - 452 , Fig . 1B ) that are contiguous with each of the 12 basal Pol domains that constitute protein A’s C - proximal portion . Similarly , as detailed further in the main text , the legs ( orange ) are singled out as the A N segments linked to the 12 basal Pol domains by numerous criteria , including their 12 - fold repetition , position , volume , appropriately oriented membrane binding , the correspondingly good superposition of the A N ribbon diagram illustrated , and the absence of any other unassigned density . cytosol 10nm 50Å 50Å OMM BB AA Spherule OMM TopTop SideSide Figure 9 .

In both graded density ( left ) and densi - ty - thresholded views ( right ) , red arrowheads point to an asymmetric density within the 7 nm diameter crown floor central channel , distinct from the floor segment densities of Figs . 3 - 6 . This density ( colored teal in the right side views ) occupies a volume closely similar to that of the apical and basal polymerase lobes .
