Volume 27 August 15 , 2016 2519 Actin - binding proteins : the long road to understanding the dynamic landscape of cellular actin networks Pekka Lappalainen * Institute of Biotechnology , University of Helsinki , 00014 Helsinki , Finland ABSTRACT The actin cytoskeleton supports a vast number of cellular processes in nonmuscle cells . It is well established that the organization and dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton are controlled by a large array of actin - binding proteins . However , it was only 40 years ago that the first nonmuscle actin - binding protein , filamin , was identified and characterized . Filamin was shown to bind and cross - link actin filaments into higher - order structures and contribute to phagocytosis in macrophages . Subsequently many other nonmuscle actin - binding proteins were identified and characterized . These proteins regulate almost all steps of the actin fila - ment assembly and disassembly cycles , as well as the arrangement of actin filaments into di - verse three - dimensional structures . Although the individual biochemical activities of most actin - regulatory proteins are relatively well understood , knowledge of how these proteins function together in a common cytoplasm to control actin dynamics and architecture is only beginning to emerge . Furthermore , understanding how signaling pathways and mechanical cues control the activities of various actin - binding proteins in different cellular , developmen - tal , and pathological processes will keep researchers busy for decades . Many cell biological processes , such as migration , morphogenesis , cytokinesis , and endocytosis , rely on a dynamic actin cytoskeleton . Precisely controlled polymerization of actin filaments against mem - branes provides a force to drive membrane dynamics . Furthermore , ATP - driven movement of myosin motor proteins along actin fila - ments transports cargo , as well as moves actin filaments relative to each other , generating contractile forces . It is well established that the organization and dynamics of actin filaments in cells are regu - lated by a large array of actin - binding proteins . However , this has not been acknowledged for very long . In the beginning of 1970s , actin was mainly studied in the context of skeletal muscle contrac - tion , where it interacts with myosin II , α - actinin , and tropomyosins . Although homologues of these proteins were also shown to be expressed in nonmuscle cells ( Adelstein et al . , 1971 ; Cohen and Cohen , 1972 , Pollard and Korn , 1973 ; Lazarides and Burridge , 1975 ) , research on the role of actin in nonmuscle cells centered on the function of myofibril - like contractile structures in cell migration ( e . g . , Wessells et al . , 1971 ) . It was not until the mid - 1970s that the first nonmuscle actin regu - latory protein , filamin , was identified and characterized . Filamin was independently discovered as a protein that copurified with myosin II from chicken gizzard and as a “high – molecular weight actin filament binding protein” isolated from rabbit alveolar macrophages ( Wang et al . , 1975 ; Hartwig and Stossel , 1975 ) . Coincident with the identi - fication of filamin , it was also demonstrated that spectrin , a high – molecular weight protein identified from erythrocytes , interacts with actin ( Tilney and Detmers , 1975 ) . Biochemical studies demonstrated that filamin caused actin to form a gel . This is indicative of actin fila - ment cross - linking activity . Furthermore , cell biological studies by Stossel and Hartwig ( 1976 ) suggested that the activity of filamin can be up - regulated in ingesting macrophages compared with resting macrophages , suggesting that filamin may control the actin cyto - skeleton during phagocytosis ( Shizuta et al . , 1976 ) . A wealth of re - search carried out during the following four decades revealed that filamins not only cross - link actin filaments but also interact with a large array of cytoskeletal , adhesion , and signaling proteins to con - trol the organization of the cytoskeleton and its interactions with cell – extracellular matrix adhesions . Furthermore , filamins serve as Monitoring Editor Keith G . Kozminski University of Virginia Received : Apr 27 , 2016 Revised : Jun 14 , 2016 Accepted : Jun 14 , 2016 DOI : 10 . 1091 / mbc .

Lappalainen Molecular Biology of the Cell lipodium , which pushes the plasma membrane forward through coordinated polymerization of actin filaments against the membrane . Many animal cells also contain bipolar , contractile actomyosin bundles , of - ten called stress fibers , which contribute to cell adhesion , mechanosensing , and tail re - traction during cell migration ( Blanchoin et al . , 2014 ) . Moreover , cells harbor several additional actin filament arrays that gener - ate force for other processes involving membrane dynamics , such as endocytosis and mitochondrial fission ( Kaksonen et al . , 2006 ; Hatch et al . , 2014 ) . Finally , it has be - come evident that actin not only functions in the cytoplasm , but also executes specific functions inside the nucleus ( Grosse and Vartiainen , 2013 ) . Because different actin filament networks are uniquely designed to execute specific cellular processes , it is not surprising that partially different sets of pro - teins control their organization and dynam - ics . Furthermore , some actin filaments must be connected to other relevant protein ma - chineries or specific cellular membrane compartments , increasing the number of actin - binding proteins required for these functions . Thus actin filaments appear to ex - hibit a much larger diversity of 3D structures and contribute to a wider range of cellular processes than microtubules . This might at least partially explain why cells have a larger number of functionally distinct actin - binding proteins than microtubule - binding proteins . Recent evidence indicates that several biochemically and func - tionally distinct actin filament populations can be generated in cells from a single actin isoform ( Michelot and Drubin , 2011 ) . Those di - verse actin filament populations can result from the presence of dif - ferent types of actin filament – nucleating proteins , which generate filaments that subsequently are selectively decorated by distinct sets of actin - binding proteins ( Michelot et al . , 2010 ; Johnson et al . , 2014 ) . The most extensively studied actin filament – decorating pro - teins that can alter the biochemical properties of actin are tropo - myosins . Tropomyosins are a diverse family of long α - helical pro - teins that bind to the main groove of an actin filament and form continuous head - to - tail oligomers along filaments . In animals , > 30 isoforms can be generated through alternative splicing from four tropomyosin genes . When bound to filaments , tropomyosin iso - forms specify the physicochemical properties of actin , and it has been proposed that different tropomyosin isoforms can recruit spe - cific downstream proteins to filaments and hence specify different actin filament populations in cells ( Gunning et al . , 2015 ) . In addition , application of external force to actin filaments can affect their struc - tural properties and thus regulate the binding of proteins to fila - ments . This phenomenon was recently demonstrated for ADF / cofil - ins , which selectively bind and sever only flexible actin filaments while being unable to interact with actin filaments under tension ( Hayakawa et al . , 2011 ) . Moreover , studies on experimentally de - fined actin structures in vitro revealed that the architecture and con - nectivity of the actin filament network can affect activities of actin - associating proteins , including myosins ( Reymann et al . , 2012 ; Ennomani et al . , 2016 ) . Thus actin - dependent cellular processes may require several functionally distinct actin filament populations , central mechanosensory proteins in cells by undergoing conforma - tional changes and partial unfolding in response to extrinsic or in - trinsic mechanical forces ( Razinia et al . , 2012 ) . The discovery and initial characterization of filamin were soon followed by identification of a large array of proteins that regulate different aspects of actin filament turnover in nonmuscle cells . These include , among others , the actin monomer – binding protein profilin ( Carlsson et al . , 1977 ) , actin filament – severing proteins gelsolin and actin depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) / cofilin ( Yin and Stossel , 1979 ; Bamburg et al . , 1980 ) , and the heterodimeric capping protein , which blocks actin filament assembly at their rapidly growing barbed ends ( Isenberg et al . , 1980 ; Cooper et al . , 1984 ) . Finally , in the mid - 1990s the first actin filament – nucleating protein , the Arp2 / 3 com - plex , was discovered ( Machesky et al . , 1994 ; Welch et al . , 1997 ; Mullins et al . , 1998 ) . These and other studies established that actin can assemble into both protrusive and contractile structures in cells and that the dynamics of actin filaments is precisely controlled by a plethora of actin - binding proteins . Even organisms of lower com - plexity , such as yeasts , express ∼ 100 proteins that either directly or indirectly regulate the assembly or organization of the actin cyto - skeleton ( Mishra et al . , 2014 ) . In multicellular organisms , including mammals , this number is significantly higher . Why do we need such a large and diverse repertoire of actin - binding proteins ? There are a number of reasons . First , actin fila - ments contribute to a vast number of different cellular processes , many of which require specific three - dimensional ( 3D ) organization of actin filaments with distinct dynamic properties ( Figure 1 ) . During adhesion - dependent migration , cells extend thin , actin - rich mem - brane protrusions—filopodia—at their leading edge to probe the extracellular environment . Filopodia contain compact , unipolar ac - tin filament bundles . Actual advancement of the cell edge in migra - tion is driven by a branched actin filament network called the lamel - FIGURE 1 : Examples of actin filament structures of motile animal cells . Cell migration is driven by the branched lamellipodial actin filament network , which pushes the leading edge forward . Thin , parallel actin filament bundles—filopodia—that extend from the lamellipodial network sense the extracellular environment during cell migration . Many animal cells also harbor stress fibers , which are thick , bipolar actin filament bundles that also contain myosin II filaments and are thus able to contract . Stress fibers are often linked to focal adhesions , actin - rich structures mediating cytoskeleton – extracellular matrix interplay . In addition , the dynamics of many membrane organelles in cells , such as endosomes and mitochondria ( at the endoplasmic reticulum – mitochondria contact sites ) , are controlled by specific actin filament structures . Volume 27 August 15 , 2016 Actin dynamics in nonmuscle cells | 2521 whose interactions with various actin - binding proteins can be fur - ther controlled by mechanical force and architecture of the filament network . Finally , in multicellular organisms , actin filaments often display tissue - or cell - specific functions . Consequently , distinct isoforms of actin - binding proteins with biochemical activities fine - tuned to con - trol filament dynamics or organize specific networks are expressed in a cell - specific manner . For example , unicellular organisms typi - cally express only one actin filament – severing ADF / cofilin protein , but three biochemically distinct ADF / cofilin isoforms are found in mammals , each of which displays specific biochemical properties fine - tuned to control actin dynamics in the specific tissue or cell type where they are highly expressed ( Vartiainen et al . , 2002 ; Kremneva et al . , 2014 ) . What lies ahead in actin - binding protein research for the next 40 years ? Although during the past few decades we have certainly learned a great deal about the basic principles underlying actin dy - namics , there remain several important unanswered questions . The majority of biochemical and cell biological studies on actin - binding proteins have focused on analyzing the functions of individual pro - teins . However , there is already evidence that , when examined in combinations with each other , actin - binding proteins can display striking new activities relating to the dynamics or organization of actin filaments . For example , binding of ADF / cofilin to actin fila - ments triggers a change in filament conformation that is critical for their rapid disassembly via the action of another actin - binding pro - tein , Aip1 ( McGough et al . , 1997 ; Galkin et al . , 2011 ; Gressin et al . , 2015 ; Jansen et al . , 2015 ) . Furthermore , two actin filament barbed - end – binding proteins with opposing activities—heterodimeric cap - ping protein and formins—were shown to interact with each other as a complex that controls actin filament elongation at rapidly grow - ing barbed ends ( Bombardier et al . , 2015 ; Shekhar et al . , 2015 ) . Finally , it was demonstrated that different actin filament nucleation machineries compete for a limited pool of actin monomers in cells and that the actin monomer – binding protein profilin functions as a “gate keeper” between these nucleators . Profilin delivers actin monomers to power formin - and vasodilator - stimulated phospho - protein ( VASP ) – driven filament elongation ( Reinhard et al . , 1995 ; Sagot et al . , 2002 ; Evangelista et al . , 2002 ; Romero et al . , 2004 ) . Of importance , recent studies revealed that a decrease in the abun - dance or activity of profilin in cells can lead to an increase in Arp2 / 3 - induced actin filament assembly at the expense of formin - and VASP - polymerized actin filament structures , demonstrating that these different actin assembly machineries indeed compete with each other for actin monomers ( Suarez et al . , 2015 ; Rotty et al . , 2015 ) . In the future , it will be important to examine the activities of ac - tin - binding proteins in combination with each other and with other interacting proteins , as well as reconstitute different cellular actin - driven machineries in vitro to reveal the combined effects of various actin regulators in modulating network properties and functions . The latter was already achieved , for example , for the most crucial actin - binding proteins that are required for actin - based motility and for a membrane - associated actomyosin cortex ( Loisel et al . , 1999 ; Murrell and Gardel , 2012 ) . However , reconstituting more complex cellular processes remains to be done . Finally , studies focusing on regulation of actin - binding proteins by different biochemical signals and mechanical cues are likely to lead to many surprising findings concerning the principles by which the actin cytoskeleton communi - cates with cellular signaling pathways and responds to changes in mechanical properties of the extracellular environment of cells .
