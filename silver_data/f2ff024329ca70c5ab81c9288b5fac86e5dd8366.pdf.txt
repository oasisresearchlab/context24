Bissell 1 The tumour microenvironment can be a potent carcinogen , not only by facilitating cancer progression and activating dormant cancer cells , but also by stimulating tumour formation 1 . We have previously investigated stromelysin - 1 / matrix metalloproteinase - 3 ( MMP - 3 ) , a stromal enzyme upregulated in many breast tumours 2 , and found that MMP - 3 can cause epithelial – mesenchymal tran - sition ( EMT ) and malignant transformation in cultured cells 3 – 5 , and genomically unstable mammary carcinomas in transgenic mice 3 . Here we explain the molecular pathways by which MMP - 3 exerts these effects : exposure of mouse mammary epithelial cells to MMP - 3 induces the expression of an alternatively spliced form of Rac1 , which causes an increase in cellular reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) . The ROS stimulate the expression of the transcrip - tion factor Snail and EMT , and cause oxidative damage to DNA and genomic instability . These ﬁndings identify a previously undescribed pathway in which a component of the breast tumour microenvironment alters cellular structure in culture and tissue structure in vivo , leading to malignant transformation . Cancer is characterized by a progressive series of alterations that disrupt cell and tissue homeostasis . Whereas many of these altera - tions can be induced by speciﬁc mutations , faulty signals from the microenvironment also can act as inducers of tumour development LETTERS Figure 1 | MMP - 3 induces EMT through Rac1b . a , MMP - 3 - induced alterations in actin cytoskeleton .

MMPs are prominent contributors to such micro - environmental signals , because these proteolytic enzymes degrade structural components of the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) , permitting tumour invasion and metastasis . Additionally , MMPs can release cell - bound inactive precursor forms of growth factors , degrade cell – cell and cell – ECM adhesion molecules , activate precursor zymogen forms of other MMPs , and inactivate inhibitors of MMPs and other proteases 6 . Our observations that MMP - 3 can induce transformation in mammary epithelial cells in culture 4 , 5 , 7 and in transgenic mice 3 prompted investigations into the underlying molecular mechanisms . Here we show that MMP - 3 can lead directly to genomic instability and EMT , and identify the pathway that mediates these events . Induction of EMT by treatment of SCp2 mouse mammary epithelial cells with MMP - 3 is associated with a loss of intact E - cadherin , increased motility and invasiveness , downmodulation of epithelial markers , and upregulation of mesenchymal markers ( refs 4 , 5 ; Supplementary Fig . 1a , b ) , through a process that is initially reversible ( refs 4 , 5 ; Supplementary Fig . 1c ) . The MMP - 3 - induced alteration of the F - actin cytoskeleton ( Fig . 1a ) indicated the possible involvement of members of the Rho GTPase family , and although the activities of RhoA and Cdc42 were unchanged ( not shown ) , we were intrigued by an additional band in the Rac activity assay of MMP - 3 - treated cells ( Fig . 1b ) . A highly activated splice isoform of Rac1 , designated Rac1b , containing 57 additional nucleotides that result in an in - frame insertion of 19 additional amino acid residues , was discovered recently in breast and colorectal tumours 8 , 9 and has transforming characteristics when exogenously expressed in cultured cells 10 . We identiﬁed the additional Rac band induced by MMP - 3 as Rac1b by polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcription ( RT – PCR ) ( Fig . 1c ) and through the use of an antibody raised against the mouse Rac1b insertion sequence ( Fig . 1d ) ; we also found that induction of Rac1b by treatment with MMP - 3 was initially reversible ( Fig . 1e ) . We determined that the activity of Rac1b was required for the MMP - 3 - induced alterations in vimentin expression ( Supplemen - tary Fig . 2 ) and for MMP - 3 - induced motility ( Fig . 1f ) , because dominant - negative Rac1N17 attenuated the effects of MMP - 3 , and expression of Rac1b could substitute for MMP - 3 ( Fig . 1f ) . We also evaluated the relationship between the induction of Rac1b and downstream EMT by speciﬁc transcript knockdown with short interfering RNA ( siRNA ) . SCp2 cells were co - transfected transiently with yellow ﬂuorescent protein ( YFP ) , YFP - Rac1 or YFP - Rac1b , and either no siRNA , siRNA targeting Rac3 ( as negative control ) , siRNA targeting Rac1 ( which also targets Rac1b ) or siRNA selectively targeting the splice insertion sequence in Rac1b . We found that Rac1 siRNA blocked the expression of co - transfected YFP - Rac1b , and that the speciﬁc Rac1b siRNA blocked the expression of co - transfected YFP - Rac1b only , not YFP - Rac1 ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) ; none of the siRNAs affected the expression of co - transfected YFP . The effect on endogenous gene expression levels was consistent with effective knockdown of all transiently transfected cells ( about 70 % transfection efﬁciency ) and showed the following : Rac1 siRNA inhibits the expression of both Rac1 and Rac1b but does not affect Rac3 ; Rac1b siRNA selectively targets Rac1b and does not affect Rac1 or Rac3 ; and Rac3 siRNA selectively targets Rac3 and does not affect expression of Rac1 or Rac1b ( Fig . 1g ) . When SCp2 cells were transiently co - transfected with YFP and either no siRNA or siRNA targeting Rac3 , Rac1 / Rac1b or Rac1b , and then treated with MMP - 3 for 4 days , we observed that siRNA for Rac1 / Rac1b or Rac1b inhibited MMP - 3 - induced cell motility in the co - transfected colonies , whereas siRNA targeting Rac3 had no effect ( Fig . 1h ) . How can increased Rac activity lead to the diverse alterations induced by MMP - 3 ? Previous studies 11 , 12 showed that active Rac can Figure 2 | MMP - 3 / Rac1b stimulate mitochondrial production of ROS . a , Cellular ROS levels assessed by DCFDA . dn , dominant - negative .

LETTERS NATURE | Vol 436 | 7 July 2005 124 © 2005 Nature Publishing Group stimulate the production and release of mitochondrial superoxide into the cytoplasm . The production of excess superoxide can cause oxidative DNA damage and genomic instability 13 , transform cells in culture 14 and potentiate tumour progression 15 ; in addition , super - oxide is readily converted to other forms of ROS that stimulate further tumorigenic processes 15 – 17 . We found that treatment with MMP - 3 or the expression of Rac1b produced increases in cellular ROS , as assessed by the ﬂuorophore dichlorodihydroﬂuorescein diacetate ( DCFDA ) , and that the expression of Rac1N17 attenuated the induction of ROS by MMP - 3 ( Fig . 2a ) . The DCFDA ﬂuorescence partly colocalized with a mitochondrial marker protein ( Fig . 2b ) , and the identity of the induced ROS as mitochondrial superoxide was indicated by the staining pattern of nitroblue tetrazolium ( Fig . 2c ) , which forms an insoluble blue formazan in the presence of super - oxide 12 , and by the altered ﬂuorescence pattern of cells stained with JC - 1 , in which the punctate red mitochondrial staining of the J - aggregate of JC - 1 was replaced by diffuse cytoplasmic green stain - ing of the monomeric form ( Fig . 2d ) , consistent with the dissipation of membrane potential after the mitochondrial production of super - oxide 12 , 18 . To determine whether the induction of mitochondrial superoxide by MMP - 3 / Rac1b was essential for the induction of EMT , we co - transfected cells with expression plasmids encoding YFP and either catalase , superoxide dismutase 1 ( SOD1 ) or SOD2 . Catalase stimulates the decomposition of H 2 O 2 into water and molecular oxygen , whereas SOD1 and SOD2 convert superoxide into H 2 O 2 and molecular oxygen ; catalase and SOD1 are cytoplasmic enzymes , whereas SOD2 is localized to the mitochondria . These experiments demonstrated that YFP / SOD2 cells were resistant to MMP - 3 - induced scattering ( Fig . 2g ) , whereas YFP / catalase and YFP / SOD1 cells responded in a similar fashion to adjacent untransfected cells ( Fig . 2e , f ) . ROS can alter gene expression 15 – 17 and stimulate cell invasiveness 19 , and we found that the ROS - quenching agent N - acetyl cysteine ( NAC ) effectively inhibited the MMP - 3 - induced downregulation of epithelial cytokeratins ( Fig . 3a ) and the upregulation of mesenchy - mal vimentin ( Fig . 3g ) . NAC also inhibited MMP - 3 - induced cell motility , invasion and morphological alterations ( not shown ) . The induction of EMT involves the coordinated regulation of many genes 20 ; here we focused on MMP - 3 / ROS - dependent alterations in the expression levels of transcriptional regulatory proteins that mediate EMT . We determined that MMP - 3 enhances expression of the transcription factor Snail 21 , 22 ( Fig . 3c ) , and that this effect could be blocked by treatment with NAC , or induced in the absence of MMP - 3 by elevating ROS levels with H 2 O 2 or by the expression of Rac1b ( Fig . 3b ) . Expression of Snail in SCp2 cells was sufﬁcient to induce EMT : induction caused the downmodulation of E - cadherin transcript and protein levels ( Fig . 3d , e ) and led to cell scattering comparable to that induced by MMP - 3 or H 2 O 2 ( Fig . 3f ) . We also found that whereas MMP - 3 , Rac1b , H 2 O 2 or Snail can stimulate the expression of mesenchymal vimentin ( Fig . 3g ) , only MMP - 3 could stimulate the expression of Rac1b ( Fig . 3h ) . When combined with the data presented in Figs 1b – f and 2a – d , these results show that treatment with MMP - 3 stimulates the expression of Rac1b , which causes increases in cellular ROS , leading in turn to an increased expression of Snail and to EMT . We had previously found that tumours in the MMP - 3 - expressing transgenic mice showed common patterns of genomic rearrange - ments 3 , indicating that MMP - 3 might lead to genomic instability in target epithelial cells in vivo . Given the known genotoxic effects of ROS , we investigated the effects of MMP - 3 - induced ROS on the integrity of the genome under deﬁned conditions in culture . To test for DNA damage , we used ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) - con - jugated avidin , because this reagent binds to 8 - oxodeoxyguanosine , an oxidative DNA lesion with a structural similarity to biotin 23 . Cells treated with MMP - 3 showed signiﬁcantly increased FITC - avidin nuclear staining ( Fig . 4a ) that was blocked by preincubation with an oligonucleotide containing 8 - oxodeoxyguanosine ( but not with a control oligonucleotide ; not shown ) , by inhibiting the proteolytic activityof MMP - 3withGM6001 , or bytreatmentwithNAC ( Fig . 4b ) . To test for induction of genomic instability , we assayed for increased resistance of MMP - 3 - treated SCp2 mouse mammary epithelial cells to N - ( phosphonacetyl ) - L - aspartate ( PALA ) 24 , because resistance to Figure 3 | MMP - 3 - induced EMT is dependent on ROS . a , NAC inhibits MMP - 3 - induced downregulation of epithelial cytokeratin protein levels . b , Induction of Snail by MMP - 3 , and dependence on ROS . c , Snail transcript levels in response to MMP - 3 treatment ( days 1 – 4 ) and washout ( days 5 – 6 ) ; blue diamonds , treated ; red squares , untreated . d , e , Exogenous expression of Snail in SCp2 cells reduces E - cadherin transcript ( d ) and protein levels ( e ) . f , Cell scattering induced by treatment with MMP - 3 or H 2 O 2 , or by exogenous expression of Snail .

NATURE | Vol 436 | 7 July 2005 LETTERS 125 © 2005 Nature Publishing Group PALA is acquired through ampliﬁcation of the CAD gene , which encodes carbamoylphosphate synthetase / aspartate carbamyltrans - ferase / dihydroorotase 25 . Exposure to MMP - 3 led to a progressive increase in the fraction of cells that had acquired PALA resistance ( Fig . 4c ) , an increase that was due to ampliﬁcation of the CAD locus ( Fig . 4d ) . This effect could also be inhibited by treatment with NAC or by culturing under reduced oxygen tension , and could be reproduced in the absence of MMP - 3 by treatment with H 2 O 2 ( Fig . 4e ) . That the genomic instability induced by MMP - 3 was not limited to the CAD locus was shown by comparative genomic hybridization analysis , because many additional genomic ampliﬁca - tions and deletions were found in MMP - 3 - treated cells ( Fig . 4f ) , including characteristic alterations previously observed in tumours derived from the MMP - 3 transgenic mice 3 . Our results show that a key event in the MMP - 3 - induced malig - nant transformation of SCp2 cells is the induction of Rac1b , an alternative spliceisoform of Rac1 that was initially identiﬁed in breast and colon cancers 8 , 9 . Many oncogenic splice isoforms are induced in cancers 26 , and although most of these produce proteins that lack key functional domains and act by sequestering factors involved in tumour suppressive pathways into nonfunctional complexes , Rac1b is unusual in that it becomes more highly activated 27 , 28 . The fact that Rac1b is the only apparent splice isoform of Rac1 found in MMP - 3 - treated cells is also notable , because Rac1b is also the only apparent splice isoform in breast cancer cells 9 . How does treatment with MMP - 3 lead to alternative splicing of Rac1b ? It is clear that the extracellular proteolytic activity of MMP - 3 is essential ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . We have shown that MMP - 3 effectively cleaves E - cadherin , resulting in a loss of cell – cell adhesions and the relocalization of transcriptionally active b - catenin to the nucleus ( refs 4 , 5 ; not shown ) . It is important to note that MMP - 3 is not the only protease capable of initiating this pathway , as we have found that MMP - 9 ( but not MMP - 2 ) can substitute for MMP - 3 in our experimental system ( not shown ) , and MMP - 7 and MMP - 14 are also known to induce tumours when expressed in transgenic mice 2 . Furthermore , MMPs are not the only microenvironmental com - ponents implicated in tumour induction or progression . Oncogenic properties have also been attributed to transforming growth factor - b , growth factors , and hormones , and the tumour - promoting activities of chronic inﬂammation are well known 1 . Our investigations of MMP - 3 show how this factor can directly stimulate phenotypic and genotypic malignant transformation in normally functioning cells . We expect that similar or parallel pathways may be induced by other elements of the tumour microenvironment , and we suspect that such mechanisms may be much more relevant for the generation of genomic instability than predicted by current models of tumour progression . METHODS Cell culture , antibodies and plasmids . Cell culture was performed as described previously 4 , 5 ; for gene repression , a 5mgml 2 1 stock solution of tetracycline in 100 % ethanol was diluted 1 : 1 , 000 into culture medium and changed daily . To stimulate cells with MMP - 3 , we used medium that had been conditioned by SCp2 cells containing the tetracycline - regulated , autoactivated MMP - 3 con - struct 4 , 5 with expression induced by growth in the absence of tetracycline ; conditioned medium from cells repressed by treatment with tetracycline was used for controls . This conditioned medium was analysed by zymography to verify that MMP - 3 was the only MMP being expressed , and that EMT was induced by extracellular proteolytic activity ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . Except as otherwise indicated , cells were incubated for 4 days in the presence of con - ditionedmediumcontaining MMP - 3 andfor7 dayswith 25 m MH 2 O 2 . NACwas used at a concentration of 10mM . Antibodies against cytokeratin and vimentin were described previously 4 , 5 . Rac antibody was from Upstate , and the Rac1b antibody was raised against the peptide Ac - CGKDRPSRGKDKPIA - amide ( anti - bodyvalidationinSupplementaryFig . 5 ) . HumancatalasecomplementaryDNA wasobtainedfromR . Arnold , andhumanSOD1andSOD2cDNAwereobtained from T . - T . Huang . SOD1 , SOD2 and catalase were cloned into pcDNA3 . 1 expression vectors ; all other constructs were subcloned into the tetracycline - repressible expression system used previously for the expression of MMP - 3 ( described in refs 4 , 5 ) . Rac1 and Rac1b were cloned from SCp2 cDNA and expressed as unmodiﬁed proteins or as fused with YFP . Rac1V12 and Rac11N17 mutantsof Rac1 ( Supplementary Figs6 and 7 ) , and aslo the catalytically inactive E217AmutantofMMP - 3 , weregeneratedwith theQuickchangemutagenesis kit ( Stratagene ) ; the sequences of all modiﬁed plasmids were veriﬁed .

For analysis of Rac1 and Rac1b ( Fig . 1c ) , oligonucleotide primers that hybridize to sequences ﬂanking the splice insertion site were used ; for speciﬁc analysis of Rac1b ( Figs 1d and 3h ) , oligonucleotide primers speciﬁc for the Rac1b splice isoform were used . Rho GTPase assays . Cells were lysed in glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) - Fish buffer ( 10 % glycerol , 50mM Tris - HCl pH7 . 4 , 100mM NaCl , 1 % Nonidet P40 , 2mM MgCl 2 , 10 m gml 2 1 leupeptin , 10 m gml 2 1 pepstatin , 10 m gml 2 1 aprotinin , 10 m gml 2 1 E64 and 1mM Pefabloc ) . Equal amounts of protein supernatants were incubated on ice for 45min with GST - PAK - CD ( Rac - binding domain and Cdc42 - binding domain ) or GST - C21 ( Rho - binding domain ) fusion protein - coated Sepharose beads . The beads were washed , eluted in sample buffer , and then analysed by SDS – polyacrylamide - gel electrophoresis and western blotting with antibodies against Rac , Cdc42 and Rho . Dominant - negative and consitu - tively active Rac1 expression constructs were provided by D . Kalman . Rac1 and Rac3 siRNA were SMARTpool reagents ( Dharmacon ) , whereas Rac1b siRNA used the sequence 5 0 - UGGAGACACAUGUGGUAAAGAUAGA - 3 0 ; siRNAs were transfected into SCp2 cells with Lipofectamine 2000 ( Gibco ) in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocols . For analysis of endogenous gene knockdown , RNA was harvested after 24h and analysed by RT – PCR with primer pairs selective for Rac1 , Rac1b or Rac3 . For MMP - 3 - induced EMT , siRNA mixtures were co - transfected with YFP - C1 and then treated with MMP - 3 for 4 days ; they were then evaluated for scatter of ﬂuorescent ( co - transfected with YFP and siRNA ) and nonﬂuorescent ( non - transfected control ) colonies . 8 - Oxodeoxyguanosine analyses and genomic instability assays . To measure ROS concentrations , cells were incubated in the dark with 50mM DCFDA ( Molecular Probes ) for 30min in serum - free and phenol - red - free medium . For 8 - oxodeoxyguanosine analysis , a modiﬁcation of published techniques 23 , 29 was used : cells were ﬁxed in methanol ( 20min , 2 20 8 C ) , permeabilized with TBST ( Tris - buffered saline containing 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 ; 15min , 25 8 C ) , blocked for non - speciﬁc binding ( TBST containing 15 % fetal calf serum ; 2h , 25 8 C ) , and stained with 15 m gml 2 1 FITC - conjugated avidin ( Sigma ; 1h , 37 8 C ) . To verify the speciﬁcity of staining , FITC - avidinwas preincubated with a tenfold excess of either the blocking oligonucleotide 5 0 - GAA CTA GT o G ATC CCC CGG GTC GC - 3 0 ( where o G is 8 - oxodeoxyguanosine ) or the control oligonucleotide 5 0 - GAA CTA GTG ATC CCC CGG GTC GC - 3 0 . Images were captured with a Nikon Diaphot 300 microscope and Spot RT camera and software ( Technical Instruments ) . Fluorescence was quantiﬁed with IMAGEJ ( http : / / rsb . info . nih . gov / ij / index . html ) . For DCFDA staining , cellular ﬂuorescence was quantiﬁed ; for FITC - avidin staining , nuclear ﬂuorescence was measured ( with a 4 , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole image mask ) . More than 250 measurements were made for each data point . JC - 1 and nitroblue tetrazolium labelling were performedessentiallyas inref . 12 . ThePALAassayand thecomparative genomic hybridization analyses were performed using modiﬁcations of previously published protocols 24 , 25 , 30 , as described in the Supplementary Information .
