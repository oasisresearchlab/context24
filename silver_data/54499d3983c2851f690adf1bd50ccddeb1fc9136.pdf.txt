We present two observational studies of pairs completing independent and shared tasks that investigate collaborative coupling , or the manner in which collaborators are involved and occupied with each other’s work . Our results indicate that individuals frequently and fluidly engage and disengage with group activity through several distinct , recognizable states with unique characteristics . We describe these states and explore the consequences of these states for tabletop interface design .

Group and organizational interfaces : computer - supported cooperative work . INTRODUCTION Many group activities , such as brainstorming , designing , and planning , involve mixed - focus collaboration , where individuals frequently transition between individual and shared tasks within a group [ 4 ] . Traditional ( non - interactive ) tabletops have been used for these activities for a long time [ 15 , 16 ] . Thus , understanding the nature of mixed - focus collaboration is crucial to designing useful collaborative interfaces for digital tables . Mixed - focus collaboration presents many challenges for tabletop design because these interfaces must support both individual and group needs , which are often in opposition [ 4 ] . For instance , should individuals be able to control how parts of the workspace are viewed , or should the group be restricted to a singular view ? While independent views of a shared workspace may support individual tasks , they may also negatively affect a group’s ability to coordinate its activities and manage shared resources [ 4 ] . To complicate matters , we do not have a systematic understanding of mixed - focus collaboration beyond recognizing the end points : individual work and shared work . Yet , individuals do not instantaneously shift between independent work and group work . Instead , a group’s collaborative coupling style ( henceforth coupling ) , or the manner in which collaborators are involved and occupied with each other’s work , frequently changes [ 1 , 12 ] . For instance , an individual might work on an idea alone before presenting it to the group , and then later work with the group to jointly manipulate the idea [ 15 , 18 ] . These kinds of transitions between independent and shared tasks have not been studied in depth . Our goal is to understand coupling in the context of tabletop collaboration for the purpose of groupware design . In the context of collaborative tasks on a shared visualization , we present two observational studies that examine how three viewing techniques , which offer different facilities for independent and group work , affect coupling : ( 1 ) lenses , which show information in spatially localized areas , ( 2 ) filters , which show information globally , and ( 3 ) ShadowBoxes , which allow spatially localized areas to be displaced [ 17 , 21 ] . As we will see , these different presentation techniques affect how groups manage and coordinate their use of the shared physical space . Consequently , their coupling style , or the way in which they work together , differs with each tool . We begin by describing how coupling relates to mixed - focus collaboration and awareness . We show how related work in collaborative tabletop literature motivates our own observational work . Our first study provides insight into how groups coordinate themselves over a spatially fixed visualization . Our second study reveals six distinct styles of coupling and how they relate to factors such as task , physical location around a tabletop , and interference management . These results motivate several design implications for the design of fluid , collaborative tabletop interfaces supporting both shared and independent work .

COLLABORATIVE COUPLING Mixed - focus collaboration is used to describe certain tasks : those that require switching between independent and shared activity [ 4 ] . Considerable evidence suggests that in both collocated and distributed shared workspaces , group activities cannot be neatly dichotomized into “independent” and “shared” activity . Researchers [ 1 , 4 , 8 , 16 , 20 ] have typically described tasks and group work as being “tightly” or “loosely” coupled ( e . g . [ 3 , 4 , 12 ] ) . Very generally , coupling refers to the dependency of participants on one another—when participants cannot do much work before having to interact , the work is tightly coupled ; conversely , when participants can work independently for long periods of time , the work is loosely coupled [ 12 ] . We use collaborative coupling to refer specifically to the manner in which collaborators are involved and occupied with each other’s work . This focus implicates the extent to which collaborators’ activities are linked to one another , and varies dynamically through the course of work from being very tight ( e . g . one individual follows another’s drawing activity by tracing simultaneously ) , to very loose ( e . g . individuals independently drawing on a work surface ) [ 3 ] . Coupling is related to workspace awareness [ 3 , 9 ] , but in co - located scenarios ( such as over a tabletop ) where no awareness information is hidden , coupling is primarily a reflection of collaborators’ need or desire to work closely or independently of one another , and in part depends on task semantics . Collaborative coupling is a way of describing group activity . As we will see , coupling is related to a wide variety of work practices on tabletops , such as physical arrangement , tool use , and fluidity of work . When a pair’s activity is highly coupled , their actions appear coordinated and fluid , likely because the goals and intentions of each individual are known to the other , thereby reducing interference . This implicit , unspoken coordination of activity is most evident when observing a loosely coupled group ( e . g . individuals working independently , or at momentarily cross purposes ) , where groups must rely on social or explicit protocols to negotiate conflicting needs . This concept of coupling is used to describe the results of our observational studies of mixed - focus collaboration . BACKGROUND Because traditional tabletops are a ubiquitous and flexible setting for collaborative work [ 11 ] , studying their use has been of interest to researchers in both the real - time groupware ( e . g . [ 4 ] ) and tabletop design communities ( e . g . [ 7 , 16 ] ) . Early observational studies of group work over traditional tabletops ( e . g . [ 18 ] ) frame our existing understanding of mixed - focus collaboration . For example , Tang’s studies [ 18 ] of group activities on traditional tables provided key insights into work practices on tabletops , including the role of gestures , the mediation of work through space , the fluidity of work activity , and the role of tabletop orientation in structuring activities . Current efforts have continued to understand tabletop work practices with the aim of supporting the fluid activity found on traditional tabletops [ 10 , 14 , 15 ] . Coordination has been studied at a conceptual level to understand how cooperative , interdependent activities can be individually conducted [ 13 ] . We use coordination to refer to workspace coordination : the management of access to and transfer of shared resources [ 9 ] . Recent efforts in developing coordination mechanisms for tabletop interfaces have recognized the importance of existing work practices and social protocols [ 7 , 10 , 11 , 14 , 15 ] . For example , early work on interactive tabletop displays automatically rotated objects , but this protocol disrupted the fundamental role that subtle rotation variations play in coordinating collaboration , namely that the orientation of objects helps define working areas [ 7 , 15 ] . Researchers have not solved the problem of supporting coordination : we still frequently observe instances of interference [ 8 , 11 ] . For instance , commands that re - arrange all objects on a table are often disruptive [ 8 ] , and individuals may sometimes attempt to manipulate single - user objects simultaneously [ 9 ] . Morris et al . [ 8 ] articulate a typology of coordination strategies to resolve these interference problems , which are classified along two dimensions : first by the scope of the conflict ( global , whole element , sub - element ) , and secondly by the resolution mechanism ( owner - controlled , mixed - initiative , reactive ) . Another approach to supporting coordination is to understand and support the work practice of territoriality : how groups spatially partition a work surface to organize and coordinate activity [ 14 , 15 , 20 ] . This approach suggests that three kinds of territories are established organically through the placement and orientation of objects in the workspace [ 15 ] : personal territories , in easy reach , are used for fine manipulation and reservation of resources ; group territories provide context for the “group” task , and used to hold shared artifacts , finally , storage territories provide temporary areas for artifact placement . This approach is compelling because it largely offloads coordination of workspace artifacts and table space to the group by providing mobile objects for interaction [ 14 ] . Yet , many tabletop activities do not involve small mobile objects . Thus , it is not clear how tabletop coordination and territoriality are supported in the presence of fixed data objects . Collaborative Exploration of Fixed Spatial Data In some mixed - focus collaboration tasks , groups cannot delineate territories using objects , potentially requiring computational assistance in coordinating view and access to the space . To understand collaborative mechanics in these contexts , we explored visualization tasks with spatially fixed data such as maps . In such tasks , the visualized data set takes up the entire display and cannot be moved from its location , potentially introducing physical and visual interference issues when individuals need to work independently in the same area . For example , in a meteorology application , one person may need to examine wind patterns while another studies temperature and pressure , both in the same geographic location . Figure 1 shows three techniques for exploring fixed spatial data that potentially support different working styles by providing view - based partitioning of the data : filters ( left ) , lenses ( top right ) , and ShadowBoxes ( bottom right ) . Filters are common in commercial mapping applications ( e . g . Google Earth [ 1 ] ) , allowing users to selectively view multiple “layers” of visual information by simply stacking them atop each other . This global approach provides a single view of the workspace . In our studies , filters could be displayed or hidden using a set of graphical buttons . Lenses are mobile , resizable windows providing the same set of data visualizations as the filters , except in a localized view [ 17 ] . Several data layers can be shown simultaneously by overlapping multiple lenses . Lenses facilitate local view changes without affecting the global space . In our studies , lenses were created by using a set of graphical buttons , and were moved and resized by dragging their borders or corners , respectively . ShadowBoxes allow users to select an area of the display and copy the underlying information to a moveable viewing window , similar to the DragMag visualization technique [ 21 ] . Interactions in the viewing window are “shadowed” in both regions , meaning that drawing and erasing activities in either location is immediately reflected in the other . This displacement allows multiple individuals to work on the same part of the data simultaneously . In our observational studies , we were interested in determining how these tools supported mixed - focus collaboration and coupling . By providing a single view , filters were expected to ease communication by facilitating gestural and deictic references [ 4 ] . Independent work was expected to be disadvantaged because view changes were global . Lenses were expected to support spatially distinct , local views of the data , allowing individuals to view and work on parts of the workspace independently . Lenses were not expected to solve the problem of physical interference that might occur when two individuals want to work in the same physical space . We believed ShadowBoxes would provide a solution to this problem by allowing individuals to work in the same part of the data in physically distinct locations . OVERVIEW OF OBSERVATIONAL STUDIES We conducted two observational studies to better understand mixed - focus collaboration . In the context of a collaborative visualization task , we wanted to understand how tools such as filters , lenses , and ShadowBoxes would be used for both the independent and shared work aspects of mixed - focus collaboration and how these affected coupling . In our first study , participant groups created routes by connecting multiple end points on a fictitious city map using our three tools to reveal data on the underlying map . This exploratory study was designed to understand how participants would use the tools to coordinate their activities over the workspace . In our second study , participant groups created routes connecting multiple end points on a fully connected graph . The purpose of this second study was to confirm the presence of certain coupling patterns observed in the first study and to characterize the role of coupling in these activities . We included specific roles for individuals within a group , and created independent and shared tasks to tease out the transitions between individual and group work . STUDY 1 : EXPLORING GROUP WORK To explore how groups work over spatially fixed data sets , we designed a map - based route creation task requiring collaborative visualization . Pairs created two separate bus routes in a map of a fictitious city ( Figure 3 , left ) . Beyond simply creating routes to connect designated end points , participants were to optimize their routes based on a set of constraints , ensuring that created routes : ( 1 ) were reasonably direct , ( 2 ) traveled along preferred streets , ( 3 ) passed through residential and commercial zones while Figure 1 . Three display techniques for coordinating space : filters being applied to a map ( left ) ; lenses being applied to the same map ( top right ) , and a ShadowBox relocating a region of the map ( bottom right ) . Figure 2 . Tabletop users completing the task from Study 1 . avoiding industrial zones , and ( 4 ) avoided overlapping with each other . Various data layers including the street map , “preferred streets , ” and locations of residential , industrial , and commercial zones were provided to groups to help them construct routes ( Figure 3 , left ) . These data layers were accessible to participants via combinations of filters , lenses and ShadowBoxes , depending on the study condition they were completing ( see Design ) . Based on prior work , we expected groups to exhibit certain kinds of behaviour : • Divide - and - conquer . We expected participants to use a divide - and - conquer approach to the task , with each individual working on a separate route ( e . g . [ 4 ] ) . • Individual work would be better supported by lenses and ShadowBoxes . We expected participants to prefer lenses and ShadowBoxes for individual work because these tools would allow individuals to work independently without disturbing the view of others . We also expected filters to induce interference because one person’s view of the space would affect the entire group’s view . • Group work would be better supported by filters . We expected participants to prefer filters when engaged in group work because we believed the single view provided a shared context for discussion , and interference would not be an issue . Design Our exploratory study used a 2 ( filters vs . lenses ) × 2 ( with ShadowBoxes vs . without ShadowBoxes ) within - subjects design . The presentation order of the conditions was counterbalanced across groups using a balanced Latin square because pilot testing suggested presentation order affected work strategy . Thus , every group participated in four different conditions : ( 1 ) filters with ShadowBoxes , ( 2 ) filters without ShadowBoxes , ( 3 ) lenses with ShadowBoxes , and ( 4 ) lenses without ShadowBoxes . Every group received a unique presentation order of these conditions . Participants Eight paid participants ( four pairs : five males , three females ) with normal or corrected - to - normal vision were recruited from the general university population . Each participant group was made up of two people who knew each other well . All participants reported being right handed . Four had previous experience with large displays , two of those had experience with tabletop setups , and five had experience with Web - based mapping software . Mean age of the participants was 29 years . Apparatus We used a large front - projected tabletop display ( 5 × 4 feet ) with high resolution ( 1534 × 1024 pixels ) supporting simultaneous two - touch interaction via SMART Technologies’ DViT . Participants could interact with the table by directly touching the table with pens or their fingers , though most participants only used pens . We placed two chairs within easy reach of the tabletop display and told participants that they could use them , but no participants chose to use the chairs in this study . Our custom - build groupware application was built with C # , and Direct3D using the Trans2D library [ 19 ] . This software ran on a dual - Xenon 2 . 8 GHz Windows XP PC . Dragging a pen or a finger over the tabletop display would draw routes on the custom - made map while dragging a digital eraser widget would erase drawn routes . The application also provided widgets to control the display of additional data based on the study condition . Because our tabletop display supported two touch interactions simultaneously , both participants in a group could draw , erase , or manipulate widgets on the tabletop at the same time . Method Participants first filled out a questionnaire to collect demographic information and to assess their experience with mapping applications . They were then given a short tutorial on how to use the table display and general instructions on the task . Prior to each of the four conditions , participants practiced with the tools they would Figure 3 . The street map provided to participants in Study 1 ( left ) and one of the fully connected graphs provided to participants in Study 2 ( right ) . be using for that condition . Participant groups generally felt comfortable about using the various tools with less than five minutes of practice before each condition . During the conditions , we instructed the participants to use a “talk aloud” protocol , and videotaped their interactions with each other and the tabletop for later analysis . On average , groups completed individual conditions in approximately 15 minutes . Once all four conditions were complete , participants took part in a semi - structured feedback session , which allowed us to gain valuable insight into their impressions of the task , the different interaction techniques , and their own performance during the study . Three observers were always present during study sessions with groups , though only one directly interacted with the participants ; the remaining two were passive observers during conditions . Observers collected field notes of group behaviours as they worked , which were later combined with the video recordings for a full analysis . Results Collected field notes and video were analyzed using an open coding approach similar to that used in other research [ 7 , 15 , 18 ] . Field notes were used to inform initial coding categories , such as whether participants were working independently or together at a given point in time . A video analysis was supplemented by a descriptive statistical analysis . We present our most salient findings below . Tendency to work together Contrary to our expectations , pairs worked together across all conditions , visibly working independently for only 24 % of the total time . This was surprising because we had predicted that participants would prefer to work independently in the presence of lenses or ShadowBoxes . In only 6 out of the total 16 study conditions ( 4 groups × 4 conditions each ) did pairs even attempt to divide up tasks . Groups generally worked together to find one route before finding the other route . Groups were highly mobile , with individuals frequently moving around the table to gain a shared perspective of the area of interest . Groups also worked in tandem . Often , one person would control the widget ( either lenses or filter buttons ) while the other would draw the route on the display . In some sense , this division of labour could be considered as divide - and - conquer ; however , the pairs were working closely together on the same problem as opposed to working independently on different aspects of a problem . Group 3 was a notable exception . In the filter conditions , this pair worked in parallel on different routes . To facilitate this parallel operation , they used the filters in a “time sharing” mode : when one needed to see a given data layer , he would tap and view his layer for as long as he needed while the other worked from memory . Group 3’s working style suggests that some groups may desire to work independently . Group 3 found an awkward way to support their independent working style since the interaction widgets we provided did not provide fluid support for them . Maintaining context In addition to working together most of the time , pairs did not use the data widgets in the ways we had expected . Most strikingly , participants overwhelmingly preferred global filters . In lens conditions , users essentially mimicked the functionality of the filters ( even when the filters had not yet been presented ) by creating table - sized global lenses , moving them in and out of the workspace to cover the working area . ShadowBoxes were simply moved out of the way ; widgets that affected the global space were preferred . Participants reported that the lens widgets suffered from several usability problems . First , they were somewhat cumbersome—resizing and moving the lenses required a switch from the route planning activity to a widget manipulation activity . Second , lenses did not support the way in which participants worked ( i . e . as a group rather than independently ) . Finally , lenses could not meaningfully partition the space because each lens needed to be larger than half of the table to provide enough information to plan each route . Since the task involved planning global routes , participants preferred global filters , which provided global rather than simply local information . Discussion Pairs were mobile and non - territorial when working over the spatially fixed data . For the most part , they moved together , worked together on the same route , and did not work independently . The entire workspace was therefore group territory and the tools for establishing personal territories ( i . e . ShadowBoxes and lenses ) were not used . Groups preferred visual mechanisms ( i . e . filters ) that allowed them to view the space together , even frequently standing in close proximity with one another , which was surprising since the workspace had no orientation cues . From Study 1 , we began to think about how to describe the group activity . For instance , many groups spent time working very tightly coupled , but in different ways : at times , they would draw routes together , and at other times , they would simply point alternatives out where one individual was more active than the other . Group 3 exhibited loose coupling , and often worked in parallel . To understand this issue of coupling further , we expanded the scope of the task to explicitly include independent , individual activity in Study 2 . STUDY 2 : TRANSITIONS IN GROUP WORK Based on the outcomes of Study 1 , the following objectives were established for Study 2 : • Giving participants independent roles . Participants often worked in tightly coupled fashion in Study 1 , but this may have been because they were not given independent roles . • Explicitly introducing independent and group tasks . By imposing activity at the extremes of mixed - focus collaboration ( independent work and shared work ) , we hoped to observe a range of group activity . • Multiple sub - problems . Study 2 had three sub - problems that could be spatially partitioned ( i . e . a person could work on each sub - problem without requiring the entire work surface ) . To induce instances of interference , one of these sub - problems slightly overlapped with the other two . Study 1’s sub - problems covered the entire space , so spatial interference may have precluded independent work . • Completely conflicting data layers . Data layers in Study 1 overlapped only in certain regions , so participants could often work with all filters turned on . In Study 2 , we used completely occluding data layers to preclude this strategy , and to simulate situations where there are so many data layers that displaying all the information needed by one person will necessarily interfere with the other . • Redesigned lens widget . Based on Study 1 feedback , we redesigned the lens to include filter buttons that could selectively apply layers in a local space . • Removal of the ShadowBox condition . To focus our efforts on the effects of local and global views on independent and group tasks , we removed the ShadowBox condition . Including a ShadowBox condition in this study would have prevented us from practically using a within - subjects design . Pairs found routes in a fully connected graph ( 114 nodes , 218 edges ; Figure 3 , right ) covering the entire workspace . This task represented an abstract route planning task ( such as airline routes ) . Two independent data overlays provided edge weight information ( “travel time” and “financial cost” ) , where the weights could be 1 , 2 or 3 . Participants generated routes to connect four specific nodes on the graph . Depending on the condition , each participant was responsible for generating one of two independent routes ( one for travel time , one for financial cost ) , or the pair was responsible for a single , group compromise route ( taking into account both travel time and financial cost ) . We also varied the visual tool pairs used : global filters , or the redesigned lenses . Design Study 2 used a 2 ( filters vs . lenses ) × 2 ( individual routes vs . compromise route ) within - subjects design . The presentation order of the conditions was counter - balanced across groups using a balanced Latin square . Hypotheses Based on the results from Study 1 , we had two major hypotheses . • Individuals will work independently with lenses . Since lenses allow people to work in different parts of the table and some sub - problems were spatially distinct , we expected independent work to occur for those independent sub - problems . We expected this to occur even when participants were working on a compromise route , since participants could use lenses to work on different areas of the route at the same time . • Perspective sharing during tightly coupled work . When working together on the same sub - problem , we expected groups to stand in close proximity to each other , thereby allowing groups to share the same perspective view of the problem space . Participants We recruited eight paid participants ( four pairs : four males , four females ) , different from those in Study 1 , with normal or corrected - to - normal vision from the general university population . Seven were right handed , two had previous experience with large displays , none had experience with tabletop setups , and six had experience with mapping software . Mean age of the participants was 28 years . Apparatus and Method We used the same apparatus and setup as Study 1 , except that we replaced the map with a custom - made , fully connected graph , and that participants used the global filter and redesigned lens widgets . Study 2 used an identical protocol to Study 1 . Results Video was analyzed using a multi - pass , open coding approach similar to [ 7 , 15 , 18 ] . Field notes were used to inform initial coding categories , such as individuals’ positions around the table and which sub - problem each was working on at a given point in time . Subsequent coding passes were driven by iteratively refined coding schemes based on further study of the videos . This methodology facilitates an intimate familiarity with the intricate , subtle mechanics occurring in the sessions , providing a very rich understanding of the underlying collaborative processes . This study imposed a variety of activities ranging from independent to group tasks , allowing us to explore a range of collaborative behaviour . Our analysis revealed six different types of collaborative coupling . These coupling styles were related to a range of other factors , including the experimental condition ( i . e . task type and tools being used ) , collaborators’ physical positioning around the table , and how interference was handled , providing strong support for our coding scheme . We begin by describing the six coupling styles we saw , and then describe other factors and how these related the coupling style . Styles of coupling Based on field notes , we iteratively refined a coding scheme for the videos in Study 2 to describe and capture the dynamic styles of coupling for each group . Individuals fluidly transitioned between styles , for example , moving from tight coupling , actively working together , to “medium coupling , ” where they worked somewhat independently on the same task . We identified six coupling styles in Study 2 ; of these , we consider the first three ( identified with round parentheses ) to be “working together . ” ( SPSA ) : ( Same problem same area ) : Collaborators are actively working together to evaluate , trace , or draw a route ( e . g . one person points at landmarks while the other connects them with a pen ) . Often , this is accompanied by conversation . ( VE ) : ( View Engaged : One working , another viewing in an engaged manner ) : The pair is working together , but only one is actively manipulating the display . For instance , one may be showing a route to the other , or one may just be watching the other’s actions very carefully . In the latter case , the individual is watching closely enough to suggest corrections . Conversation often accompanies this style . ( SPDA ) : ( Same problem , different area ) : Collaborators are working simultaneously on the same sub - problem , but are focused on different parts of the table . For instance , participants may be evaluating alternate solutions of the same sub - problem . This style is not accompanied by conversation . Instead , conversation and gestures often transition groups to more tightly coupled work . [ V ] : ( View : One working , another viewing ) : One collaborator is working on the task , and the other is watching , but is not sufficiently involved to help or offer suggestions . The person watching only reacts to high - level activities , such as when the active person stops working or needs resources ( e . g . a widget ) . [ D ] : ( Disengaged : One working , another disengaged ) : One collaborator is completely disengaged from the task , not paying any attention to the task or partner . [ DP ] : ( Different problems ) : Collaborators are working completely independently on separate sub - problems at the same time . Each person’s interactions with the workspace are not related to the other in any way . In this style , participants often peeked at one another to maintain an awareness of the other’s activities . After coding each of the 16 sessions ( 4 groups × 4 conditions ) , we ran a set of statistical analyses to understand how coupling related to the study conditions . Total time spent working in a particular coupling style was broken down by study condition . These coupling styles were subjected to a two - way , within - subjects ANOVA with repeated measures ( filters and lenses × individual and compromise routes ) . Relationship between coupling styles and tool / task type Consistent with our hypotheses , when creating compromise routes , pairs’ were more tightly coupled than when creating individual routes . They also worked more tightly with global filters than with lenses . Figure 4 shows the mean proportion of time participants spent working in particular coupling styles as broken down by condition . The ANOVA revealed a borderline significant interaction between interaction technique ( filters and lenses ) and route type ( individual and compromise ) in the amount of time participants spent working on different problems ( DP ) [ F ( 1 , 3 ) = 9 . 5 , p = . 054 , η 2 = . 76 ] . Additional main effects for interaction technique [ F ( 1 , 3 ) = 14 . 3 , p = . 032 , η 2 = . 827 ] and route type [ F ( 1 , 3 ) = 14 . 9 , p = . 031 , η 2 = . 833 ] were also present for different problems ( DP ) . These effects collectively suggested that participants spent the most time working on different problems in the lens + individual route condition . A main effect was also present for route type and the amount of time participants spent working on the same problem and same area ( SPSA ) [ F ( 1 , 3 ) = 159 . 6 , p = . 001 , η 2 = . 982 ] . This indicated that participants spent more time working together on compromise routes than they did when working on individual routes . This was unsurprising given the differences between the two task types . In all groups , we observed that participants worked independently and loosely coupled on the two problems that could be spatially separated , and then transitioned into more tightly coupled work , working closely on the problem that overlapped in the lens + individual condition . We were surprised by the activity in the lens + compromise condition , where we expected all participants to work in parallel on separate sub - problems . Instead , we found that three groups worked together in this condition about 96 % of the time . Group 2 was an exception : they worked in a parallel , independent manner to generate the best individual routes , and later worked in a more tightly coupled manner to find the best compromise based on the individual solutions . They only worked together about 51 % of the time . Conversely , we found that participants usually worked together when using global filters . They worked together 79 % of the time on individual routes and 94 % of the time on compromise routes . Figure 4 . Observed coupling styles in each study condition . Arrangement We suspected that with tighter coupling , participants stood physically closer to one another . To examine this relationship , we first video coded participants’ location changes , thereby providing arrangement information , and then cross - tabulated this data with coupling style . Our coding scheme ( Figure 5 ) considered the relative positions of participants and not their absolute positions . As we expected , when collaborators worked more closely together , they stood physically closer , and when they worked independently , they stood further apart . This can be seen as a dark diagonal trend from the top left to bottom right of Table 1 . Although this effect is complicated by the fact that participants were physically closer when working on the same sub - problem , it corresponds with results from our first study , which did not have spatially separated sub - problems . A notable exception to this observation is that Side by Side arrangements were physically closer than Straight Across , yet Straight Across was a very common arrangement for group work . This result is likely the consequence of the particular collaborative ergonomics of our table : working Straight Across the table yielded a good position to work on the same problem while providing smooth face - to - face communication . Similarly , when working independently , standing Side By Side rather than Straight Across may have reduced visual distraction . Consistent with prior work [ 15 , 20 ] , physical positioning appeared to be related to territorial behaviour . Individuals tended to explicitly interact only with areas physically close to them , and avoided interacting with areas physically close to their partner ( an exception is shown in Figure 6 ) . Yet , these “territories” were transient . As individuals moved , others were no longer restricted from operating in those areas . Similarly , when a pair worked closely together on the same problem , we often observed one person taking on the other’s perspective . In these instances , the second person would never displace the first : even if the second person was to gesture toward the table , he would move to a different location around the table before doing so . Handling interference We also saw many instances of interference , where one collaborator either blocked another’s view or ability to physically interact with the workspace ( Figure 6 ) . When more tightly coupled , interference was less frequent , and was handled more gracefully , with one person moving out of the way just as another moved into the space . When collaborators worked in a loosely coupled fashion , we saw more frequent instances of one participant waving the other away , and in some cases , physically pushing or grabbing each other . Not all interference was detrimental . While interference often interrupted independent work , interference ( intentional or otherwise ) often signaled or aided groups to transition to more tightly coupled working styles . For instance , any activity covering workspace ( e . g . one person counting or drawing ) often signaled that one collaborator “had a good solution . ” Since many pairs liked to validate their routes together , this activity would act as an invitation to closer collaboration ( i . e . tighter coupling ) . Discussion The original observations we made in Study 1 were largely consistent with the results of Study 2 . Participants preferred tools that supported their particular working style . Despite explicit independent and group tasks in Study 2 , participants generally preferred to work together when they had joint responsibility for the outcome of the task , as was true when they were constructing compromise routes . From Study 2 , we identified six collaborative coupling styles to describe the workspace activity . These styles were closely related to other factors such as physical arrangement , the task and tool being used , and the incidence of interference . The coupling descriptors are useful in that they contribute to the description of significant aspects of group activity by characterizing the White : < 1 % Light grey : 1 - 4 % Dark grey : > 4 % SPS A VE SP DA V D D P ( a ) Together 7 . 8 1 . 6 3 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 2 0 . 5 ( b ) Kitty corner 9 . 4 1 . 9 5 . 2 2 . 4 0 . 9 1 . 9 ( c ) Side by side 2 . 5 1 . 0 2 . 3 0 . 9 0 . 9 3 . 1 ( d ) Straight across 9 . 2 2 . 3 8 . 7 3 . 3 2 . 3 1 . 0 ( e ) Angle across 3 . 8 1 . 4 2 . 4 2 . 3 1 . 4 6 . 2 ( f ) End side 0 . 5 0 . 1 0 . 1 0 . 3 0 . 3 4 . 9 ( g ) Opposite ends 0 . 0 0 . 0 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 0 3 . 1 Table 1 : Percent time working in each coupling style and physical arrangement . Arrangement categories are in increasing order of average distance between participants . Coupling styles range from working closely together ( left ) to working independently ( right ) . Figure 5 . We coded seven position arrangements around the table ( based on relative positions ) : ( a ) together , ( b ) kitty corner , ( c ) side by side , ( d ) straight across , ( e ) angle across , ( f ) end side , and ( g ) opposite ends . nature of mixed - focus collaboration : namely , that groups frequently and fluidly transition between several stages of working closely and working independently . GENERAL DISCUSSION In studying participants as they work over tabletops , and in attempting to communicate those observations to a wider audience , we have come to appreciate that collaboration is a highly complex and multifaceted construct—even when we constrain the investigation to real - time tabletop collaboration within a task in a study . The term “coupling , ” and associated terms “tightly coupled” ( that entities work closely together ) , and “loosely coupled” ( that entities work fairly independently ) , for example , have been used to describe one dimension of collaboration . Yet we have found that there exist many points along the spectrum between the two endpoints , and suspect that the nature of collaboration may vary in other orthogonal dimensions . We describe six collaborative coupling styles , though do not believe this is an exhaustive list . The styles we observed were likely limited by the specific parameters of our study . For instance , if we had limited ourselves to the methodology of Study 1 , we would not have seen the extent of varied styles of independent work that we described above . We expect that additional styles may be uncovered through studies with different user groups , tools , and tasks . Although we attempted to order the coupling styles from tightest to loosest , the detailed ordering of all pairs is not necessarily obvious or finalized . We are unsure whether these coupling styles even fall along a single dimension . For instance , same - problem - same - area , view - engaged , and same - problem - different area appear to fall along a continuum of “degree of involvement in the other’s task . ” However , it is not unclear whether coupling is tighter when working on different problems or when one person is disengaged . To account for these observations , a promising approach may be to consider how collaboration might be described as a dynamic and fluid stateless system [ 6 ] . Implications for Tabletop Design Groups move frequently and fluidly between many styles of coupling . Each style is accompanied by different behavioural mechanics . For example , in tight coupling , individuals work in close proximity even when the workspace has no implicit orientation . Furthermore , different display techniques support different styles : independent views support individual work because they reduce interference , and global views support group work because they provide common ground . 1 . Support a flexible variety of coupling styles . Mixed - focus collaboration encompasses many coupling styles : even in our own studies , there was a wide variance in the approach groups took . Most systems fail to provide support for multiple coupling styles , falling back on social protocols to effect different coupling styles ( e . g . [ 7 , 10 , 15 ] ) . Since tabletop displays are dynamic , we can provide a variety of tools to support different coupling styles . A promising future direction may be the convergence of physical and digital media on tables as an alternative means for providing individual and group views . 2 . Provide fluid transitions between coupling styles . Supporting mixed - focus collaboration requires supporting the transitions between loosely coupled independent work and tightly coupled group work [ 1 ] . Providing only a single view of the workspace limits individuals’ abilities to work independently [ 4 ] , yet using separate copied workspaces may prevent many group collaborative dynamics , such as being able to see what others are doing , from emerging [ 16 ] . Our results do not suggest mitigating interference altogether since some forms of interference signal transitions between coupling styles and benefit group coordination . Furthermore , the recognition of interference can be used as a means to fluidly transition between coupling styles . For instance , the act of rotating an object toward a fellow collaborator temporarily signals the desire for attention [ 7 ] : the system may also use this cue to transition the workspace to match the tighter coupling . 3 . Provide mobile high resolution personal territories . The interference we observed was a direct result of individuals’ desired working areas overlapping . Creating usable and useful personal territories could take several avenues , including a higher resolution workspace , or mobile regions of high resolution , or even using distinct displays for personal work ( such as Tablet PCs or PDAs ) . 4 . Support lightweight annotations . Tabletop task spaces should support mobile , unobtrusive , and transient annotations . One of the affordances of the Figure 6 . A series of frames representing a particular instance of interference with a loosely coupled pair ( note how they are focused on different areas of the workspace in frame 1 ) . tabletop form factor is the ability to conduct independent work unobtrusively [ 18 ] . Annotations help to generate and track independent work , and may be moved to be shared with the group [ 7 ] . In our studies , participants surprised us by frequently annotating the map space with both spatially - relevant and spatially - invariant annotations . These annotations sometimes helped and other times hindered the other participant . We recommend supporting the easy creation , mobility and modification of annotations . CONCLUSIONS We presented two observational studies of mixed - focus collaboration , exploring the transitions groups make in their coupling styles . These coupling styles are descriptions of group activity and behaviour , allowing us to characterize the activity of groups . The two studies have demonstrated that different coupling styles are related to other variables such as preferred tools , physical arrangement , and the incidence and handling of interference . For example , groups use tighter coupling styles when working together closely , preferring common , global views . By providing a preliminary characterization of these coupling styles , we have identified design opportunities for tabletop researchers to support collaborative work . A flexible set of tools allowing fluid transitions between views is required to fully support the dynamics of mixed - focus collaboration .
