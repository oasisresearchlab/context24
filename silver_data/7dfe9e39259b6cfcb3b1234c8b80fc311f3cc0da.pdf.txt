Collins 1 , Ming Zhou 2 , Yongzhen Qian 1 , Timothy Veenstra 2 , and Patricia S . Steeg 1 Abstract Nm23 - H1 has been identi ﬁ ed as a metastasis suppressor gene , but its protein interactions have yet to be understood with any mechanistic clarity . In this study , we evaluated the proteomic spectrum of interactions made by Nm23 - H1 in 4T1 murine breast cancer cells derived from tissue culture , primary mammary tumors , and pulmonary metastases . By this approach , we identi ﬁ ed the actin - severing protein Gelsolin as binding partner for Nm23 - H1 , verifying their interaction by coimmunoprecipitation in 4T1 cells as well as in human MCF7 , MDA - MB - 231T , and MDA - MB - 435 breast cancer cells . In Gelsolin - transfected cells , coexpression of Nm23 - H1 abrogated the actin - severing activity of Gelsolin . Conversely , actin severing by Gelsolin was abrogated by RNA interference – mediated silencing of endogenous Nm23 - H1 . Tumor cell motility was negatively affected in parallel with Gelsolin activity , suggesting that Nm23 - H1 binding inactivated the actin - depolymerizing function of Gelsolin to inhibit cell motility . Using indirect immuno ﬂ ourescence to monitor complexes formed by Gelsolin and Nm23 - H1 in living cells , we observed their colocalization in a perinuclear cytoplasmic compartment that was associated with the presence of disrupted actin stress ﬁ bers . In vivo analyses revealed that Gelsolin overexpression increased the metastasis of orthotopically implanted 4T1 or tail vein – injected MDA - MB - 231T cells ( P ¼ 0 . 001 and 0 . 04 , respectively ) , along with the proportion of mice with diffuse liver metastases , an effect ablated by coexpression of Nm23 - H1 . We observed no variation in proliferation among lung metastases . Our ﬁ ndings suggest a new actin - based mechanism that can suppress tumor metastasis . Cancer Res ; 73 ( 19 ) ; 5949 – 62 . (cid:1) 2013 AACR . Introduction Metastatic disease and the complications of its treatment arethe major causes of death inpatients with breastcancer ( 1 ) . Metastasis suppressor genes have provided novel insights into the molecular control of metastasis . Upon overexpression , metastasis suppressors have no effect on primary tumor size , but signi ﬁ cantly reduce metastasis formation ( 2 ) . Nm23 was the ﬁ rst metastasis suppressor gene to be iden - ti ﬁ ed ( 3 ) . To date , 10 different Nm23 genes ( Nm23 - H1 to Nm23 - H10 ) have been identi ﬁ ed in humans ; the - H1 and - H2 forms are the most studied ( 4 ) . In vitro , a hallmark of Nm23 is its suppression of motility to a variety of chemoattractants . Transfection of Nm23 genes signi ﬁ cantly inhibited metastasis in multiple model systems ( 5 ) ; where studied , primary tumor size was unaffected . In leukemias , lymphomas , and neuroblas - toma , opposite trends were observed . Identifying the mecha - nism ( s ) of Nm23 - H1 suppression of metastasis will be key to developing effective metastasis - preventive strategies for this pathway , but it remains incomplete . Potential contributors to Nm23 - H1 ' s suppression of metastasis include its histidine kinase activity , nucleotide diphosphate kinase activity , and 3 0 - 5 0 - exonuclease activity ( 6 ) , as well as protein – protein inter - actions ( reviewed in ref . 7 ) . The analysis of protein – protein interactions involving Nm23 - H1 has been hampered by non - speci ﬁ c associations , and has identi ﬁ ed few interactions of obvious importance to the hallmark motility phenotype . Here , we have taken an unbiased approach to identify potential binding partners for the human ( - H1 ) and murine ( - M1 ) forms of Nm23 in cultures , primary tumors , and metas - tases formed by murine 4T1 mammary carcinoma cells . We report that Nm23 - H1 and - M1 bind to Gelsolin , the founding member of a family of actin - binding proteins involved in the remodeling of cellular actin ﬁ laments , regulating cell shape changes and movement ( 8 ) . Structurally Gelsolin is composed ofaCa þþ - dependentregulatoryC - terminalfragment , anactin - severing N - terminal fragment , and a 70 – amino acid connector containing the consensus for caspase - 3 – mediated cleavage ( 9 ) . After Ca þþ - dependent activation , Gelsolin binds and severs actin ﬁ laments and caps their fast - growing ends .

CAN - 13 - 0368 Gelsolin from the actin ﬁ laments ( uncapping ) is mediated by phospholipids such as phosphatidyl inostil 4 , 5 bisphosphate ( PIP2 ; ref . 10 ) and lysophosphatidic acid ( LPA ; ref . 11 ) permit - ting actin polymerization . Gelsolin null mice were viable ( 12 ) ; in dermal ﬁ broblasts from null mice , reduced membrane lamellipodia and motility were observed , with enhanced Rac expression and increased F - actin in stress ﬁ bers ( 13 , 14 ) . Gelsolin also participates in lipid signaling ( 15 ) and the apo - ptotic process ( 16 , 17 ) and various protein – protein interac - tions ( 18 – 21 ) . The correlation between Gelsolin expression and tumori - genesis is still controversial ( 22 – 25 ) . To date , the role of Gelsolin expression in metastasis is incompletely described . In vitro studies report that Gelsolin overexpression promoted tumor cell motility andinvasion through modulation of several pathways , including EGFreceptor ( EGFR ) , phosphoinositide 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) , and Ras – PI3K – Rac ( 14 , 26 , 27 ) . In vivo , Gelsolin suppressed the epithelial – mesenchymal transition in mam - mary epithelial cells ( 28 ) and acted as a metastasis suppressor in B16 melanoma cells ( 29 ) . Herein , we show that Nm23 - H1 binds to Gelsolin in multiple breast cancer cell lines , and abrogates Gelsolin ' s actin - depo - lymerization activity in vitro . In contrast with the limited published literature , Gelsolin overexpression in murine 4T1 and human MDA - MB - 231T model systems had a signi ﬁ cant effect on primary tumor formation and stimulated metastasis to the lungs and liver . Co - overexpression of Gelsolin and Nm23 - H1 reduced Gelsolin ' s promotion of motility in vitro and metastasis in vivo . Materials and Methods Cell culture conditions and treatments Humanbreast cancercell lines MDA - MB - 435andMCF7 , and immortalized kidney cell line HEK293TN were obtained from American Type Culture Collection .

DMEM containing 600 m g / mL of G418 ( Invitrogen ) was used to select for clonal lines . Gelsolin full - length or C - and N - terminus fragments ( amino acids 1 – 360 and 361 – 742 , respectively ) cDNAs were ampli ﬁ ed from pcDNA - Gelsolin , obtained from Dr . Shigeomi Shimizu ( Medical Research Institute Tokyo , Tokyo , Japan ) . The cDNAs were ﬁ rst cloned into pENTR / D - TOPO vector and then inserted into an N - terminal GFP fusion vector , pcDNA 6 . 2 / N - EmGFP using LR recombination reaction according to the manufacturer ' s recommendations ( Gateway vector system ; Invitrogen ) . Plasmids were transfected into cells using Effec - tene ( Bio - Rad ) . Cells were subsequently cultured in complete DMEM with blasticidin ( 5 m g / mL ) for selection . Gene silencing MISSION The RNAi Consortium short hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) constructs were purchased from Sigma - Aldrich and included nontarget control shRNA ( SHC216 ) , shRNA to Gelsolin ( TRCN0000029727 ) , shRNA to Nm23 - H1 ( TRCN0000010061 ) . Cell infection procedure was followed according to the man - ufacturer ' s protocol . Immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry Lysates were prepared by washing cells twice in PBS , fol - lowed by incubation for 30 minutes on ice with a gentle lysis buffer [ 20 mmol / L Tris pH 8 . 0 , 137 mmol / L NaCl , 10 % glycerol , 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 , 1 mmol / L phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂ uoride ( PMSF ) , 20 m mol / L leupeptin , 0 . 15 U / mL aprotinin , and 5 mmol / L sodium vanadate ] .

Primary antibodies used for either immunoprecipitation or Western blot analyses are the following : mouse anti - Flag ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , rabbit anti - Flag ( Cell Signaling Technology ) , rabbit anti - GFP ( Cell Signaling Technology ) , mouse anti - GFP ( Abcam ) , rabbit anti - Gelsolin ( Abcam ) , mouse anti - Gelsolin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , mouse anti - Nm23 - H1 ( BD Biosciences ) , rab - bit anti - Nm23 - H1 ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , rabbit anti - PARP ( Cell Signaling Technology ) , rabbit - anti - caspase - 3 ( Cell Signaling Technology ) , and rabbit anti - cleaved caspase - 3 ( Cell Signaling Technology ) . Mouse anti - a - tubulin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) was used as a loading control in Western blot analyses . Transwell cell migration assay Transwell migration assays were conducted in Boyden chambers as described previously ( 31 ) . The reported results represent the average of triplicate experiments . Actin - severing and polymerization assays The Gelsolin - severing activity was measured using the Pyr - ene – Actin Polymerization Kit ( Cytoskeleton ) following the manufacturer ' s protocol . Brie ﬂ y , 1 mg / mL puri ﬁ ed rabbit muscle pyrene – actin ( Cytoskeleton ) was diluted to 30 m g / mL and resuspended in polymerization buffer ( 50 mmol / L KCl , 2 mmol / L MgCl 2 , 0 . 5 mmol / L ATP , and 2 mmol / L Tris , pH 8 . 0 ) , incubated for 1 hour to form actin polymers . Cell lysates were prepared and 10 m L of equal amount of total protein was added to the ﬁ nal reaction volume ( 200 m L ) . The rate of ﬂ orescence loss at 590 nm ( 530 - nm excitation wavelength ) was measured by ﬂ uorometry ( VersaMax , Microplate Fluorescence Reader ) using Softmax Pro 5 . 4 software . To measure the actin - poly - merization activity , pyrene – actin was diluted to 2 . 3 m mol / L in the general actin buffer ( 5 mmol / L Tris – HCl pH 8 . 0 and 0 . 2 mmol / L CaCl 2 ) containing 0 . 2 mmol / L ATP and 0 . 5 mmol / L Dithiothreitolandstoredonicefor60minutestodepolymerize actin oligomers . The tubes were centrifuged at 14 , 000 (cid:3) g force for 30 minutes at 4 (cid:2) C . The supernatants containing pyrene - actin monomers were mixed with lysates , added into the 96 - well plates , and held for 3 minutes . After the addition of 1 / 10 volumeof10 (cid:3) ofpolymerizationbuffer ( 500mmol / LKCland10 mmol / L MgCl 2 ) , the kinetics of pyrene ﬂ uorescence upon initiation of actin polymerization was monitored for 2 hours at 405 nm with an excitation wavelength of 355 nm using Microplate Fluorescence Reader . Immuno ﬂ uorescence microscopy Approximately , 1 (cid:3) 10 4 cells were plated in each chamber of 4 - well chamber slides ( BD Biosciences ) and grown for 24 hours .

After washing four times with PBS , sections were mounted in Fluorescent Mounting Medium ( DakoCytomation ) , and photographed using either Zeiss AxioSkope 2 microscope or confocal micro - scope Zeiss 710UV and ZEN2009 software . Spontaneous and experimental metastasis assays Experiments were carried out under an approved National Cancer Institute Animal Use Agreement . Six - week - old Balb / c and athymic nude females were obtained from Charles River Laboratories ( National Cancer Institute - Frederick Animal Pro - duction Area ) . The spontaneous metastasis assay was con - ducted with 4T1 cells at a concentration of 5 (cid:3) 10 5 cells / 50 m L , which were injected under anesthetic into the # 4 mammary fat pad ( mfp ) of Balb / c mice . Primary tumors were measured by caliper every third day . On day 18 postinjection , primary tumors were resected under iso ﬂ urane anesthesia . On week 10 postinjection , mice were sacri ﬁ ced and all relevant tumor and organ materials were ﬁ xed and embedded in optimal cutting temperature ( OCT ) medium . Ten mice per experimen - tal arm were used . Mice were weighed weekly and monitored for signs of morbidity and labored breathing . The experimental pulmonary metastasis study was con - ducted by injecting 5 (cid:3) 10 5 MDA - MB - 231T cells into the lateral tail vein of athymic nude mice . Nine weeks postinjection , at necropsy , the lungs were collected and ﬁ xed in Bouins ' solu - tion . Surface metastatic lesions were counted on all lungs before embedding in paraf ﬁ n , reported as a median for each group . Histologic analysis OCT - embedded lungs and livers of mice from the spontane - ous metastasis 4T1 model were sectioned ( 7 m m ) on a cryostat . Lungs collected from the experimental metastasis MDA - MB - 231T model were paraf ﬁ n - embedded and sectioned ( 10 m m ) .

CAN - 13 - 0368 Results Identi ﬁ cation of Nm23 - H1 – binding proteins To identify the Nm23 coimmunoprecipitating proteins , we used murine 4T1 mammary carcinoma cells , previously trans - fected with a vector , nm23 - H1 ( human isoform 1 ) or nm23 - M1 ( murine ) , the latter two fused to a C - terminal Flag epitope ( 32 ) . In agreement with other Nm23 transfections ( 33 ) , overexpres - sion of either human or murine Nm23 reduced in vitro motility in Boyden chambers by 57 % ( P ¼ 0 . 0002 ) and 85 % ( P < 0 . 0001 ) , respectively , compared with vector ( Fig . 1A ) . Implantation of the vector - or Nm23 - transfected 4T1 cells into the mfp of syngeneic mice resulted in comparable primary tumor sizes 10 days postinjection ( 32 ) . When primary tumors were surgically removedandmicewerekeptuntilweek10postinjection , Nm23 overexpression reducedthenumberofquanti ﬁ able metastases totheliverby60 % to70 % andlungsby84 % to95 % ( 32 ) . Thus , in the 4T1 model system , Nm23 - H1 or - M1 overexpression exhib - ited typical characteristics of a motility - and metastasis sup - pressor gene . To identify the Nm23 - binding proteins , Flag - tagged Nm23 - H1 and - M1 proteins were immunoprecipitated from lysates of transfected 4T1 cells in vitro , from mfp primary tumors , and from grossly dissected lymph node - , spleen - , and liver metasta - ses . Electrophoresed coimmunoprecipitating proteins ( Fig . 1B ) were eluted and identi ﬁ ed using mass spectrometry . Table 1 lists selected potential coimmunoprecipitating proteins , noting the number of peptides sequenced from each cell line or organ preparation . This list included several proteins previously docu - mented to bind Nm23 , con ﬁ rming the procedure used . Coim - munoprecipitation of Nm23 and the identi ﬁ ed proteins was limited to tissue culture and primary tumors , and was largely lost in actual metastases . Notable candidates included several cytoskeletal proteins , which might underlie Nm23 function in tumor motility , invasion , and metastasis . Nm23 proteins bind to Gelsolin One of the candidate proteins resulting from this analysis was the actin - binding protein Gelsolin . Notably , 52 and 75 peptides of Gelsolin were sequenced from anti - Flag – Nm23 - H1 and - M1 immunoprecipitated primary tumor lysates , respec - tively . Binding was reduced or lost in the lymph node , spleen , and liver metastases . Coimmunoprecipitation assays were used to verify the interaction between Nm23 and Gelsolin in the murine mam - mary carcinoma cell line 4T1 overexpressing Flag - tagged Nm23 - H1 and - M1 ( Fig . 2A , left ) . Either anti - Flag or anti - Gelsolin antibodies were used to pull down the target protein from the cell lysates ( Fig . 2A , right ) . Coimmunoprecipitation of Gelsolin and Nm23 was observed in both Nm23 - H1 and M1 samples . Coimmuno ﬂ uorescence of Nm23 and Gelsolin was conducted in 4T1 cells overexpressing Nm23 - M1 along the edge ofascratchmotilityassay ( Fig . 2B ) . AlthoughGelsolinwas expressed in both cell edges and cytoplasm along the actin cytoskeleton structure , colocalization of the two proteins was observed exclusively in the cytoplasmatic compartment of the cells .

CAN - 13 - 0368 interaction of Nm23 – Gelsolin may be an indirect result of Nm23bindingtotheactin ﬁ laments . Treatmentofthe4T1cells with latrunculin B , an actin - depolymerization agent ( 34 ) , destroyed the F - actin cytoskeleton but did not eliminate the Nm23 – Gelsolin coimunoprecipitation ( Fig . 2C and Supple - mentary Fig . S1 ) . To validate the Nm23 - H1 – Gelsolin interaction observed in themammary cell line 4T1 , asecond cellularmodel , the human breast carcinoma cell line MDA - MB - 231T , was used . Empty vector and Flag - tagged Nm23 - H1 constructs were transfected in MDA - MB - 231T cells ( Fig . 2D , left ) . Anti - Nm23 and anti - Gelsolin antibodies were used to pull down the endogenous proteins together with exogenous Flag - tagged Nm23 - H1 ( Fig . 2D , right ) . The Nm23 - H1 – Gelsolin complex was detected only in Nm23 - H1 – overexpressing MDA - MB - 231T cells , which was consistent with our inability to detect even low levels of Nm23 - H1 immunoprecipitation inlysatesinthevector - expres - sing controls . Immuno ﬂ orescence con ﬁ rmed the colocaliza - tion of the two proteins in the perinuclear compartment ( Fig . 2E ) , and the complex remained after destruction of the actin cytoskeleton by latrunculin B ( Fig . 2F and Supplementary Fig . S1 ) . The data con ﬁ rm an interaction of transfected Nm23 - H1 and Gelsolin in two breast carcinoma cell lines . When Gelsolin was fragmented into N - and C - terminal subunits , Nm23 - H1 coimmunoprecipitated with the C - terminal frag - ment ( Supplementary Fig . S2 ) . The coimmunoprecipitation results were validated in other two cell lines , MDA - MB - 435 and HEK293TN , overexpressing the empty vector and Nm23 - H1 or both Nm23 - H1 and Gelsolin , respectively ( Supplementary Fig .

CAN - 13 - 0368 To evaluate the interaction of Nm23 - H1 and Gelsolin at endogenous levels , we used the MCF7 human breast carcino - ma cell line . This cell line contains a higher Nm23 level compared with MDA - MB - 231T cells ( Fig . 2G , left ) . Both the immunoprecipitation and immuno ﬂ orescence assays showed that Nm23 and Gelsolin interacted in an F - actin – independent manner and colocalized in the cytoplasmic compartment ( Fig . 2H and I and Supplementary Fig . S1 ) . Nm23 overexpression inhibits the actin - severing activity of Gelsolin Gelsolin is a potent F - actin – severing protein that , after ﬁ lament cleavage , remains bound to the newly formed end ( capping ) . In this way , Gelsolin facilitates depolymerization by blocking actin monomer addition at the growing end , whereas actin disassembly proceeds at the opposite end of the ﬁ lament ( 35 ) . Gelsolin also has two contrasting functions in apoptosis : ( i ) it has a proapoptotic role after cleavage by caspases , leading to uncontrolled F - actin severing ; ( ii ) it can also prevent apo - ptosis by stabilizing mitochondria ( 9 , 17 ) . We hypothesized that Gelsolin ' s interaction with Nm23 would inhibit its actin - depolymerization function , given Nm23 ' s profound effects on motility . Clonal cell lines overexpressing either a vector or Gelsolin , the latter with a GFP tag at its N - terminus , and either a vector or Nm23 ( - H1 and - M1 ) - Flag were created in both the 4T1andMDA - MB - 231Tcelllines . TheGFPtagdidnotinterfere with Gelsolin interaction with Nm23 ( Supplementary Fig . S4 ) . To evaluate whether Nm23 overexpression and interaction could affect actin cytoskeleton remodeling by Gelsolin , actin polymerization and depolymerization rates were measured using an in vitro , ﬂ uorescence - based assay for F - actin forma - tion or severing activity . In 4T1 cells , transfection of either Gelsolin or Nm23 - H1 had no effect on actin polymerization ( Fig . 3A ) , in keeping with the lack of reported Gelsolin effect on actin polymerization ( 36 ) . However , a decrease in ﬂ uorescent signal , corresponding to an increase in F - actin severing , was observed in the lysate from Gelsolin - overexpressing cells when the actin - depolymerization assay was conducted ( Fig . 3B ) , consistent with the reported literature ( 35 ) . In contrast , no ﬂ orescence decay was observed in the reaction with lysates containing 4T1 cells overexpressing Nm23 alone or together with Gelsolin . Phalloidin staining was used to analyze the actin cytoskeleton structure ( Fig . 3C ) . Severing activity associated with Gelsolin expression in 4T1 cells was visualized by the decreased number of actin ﬁ laments ( stress ﬁ bers ) and appearance of short ﬁ laments or actin monomer accumula - tion ( red dots ) . Nm23 overexpression together with Gelsolin reversed this phenotype as the actin cytoskeleton appeared similar to that in the vector cells . Data were validated using lysates from MDA - MB - 231T cells ( Fig . 3D – F ) . Similar results were obtained when actin - severing activity was measured in protein lysates from a scratch - wounded con ﬂ uent layer of either 4T1 or MDA - MB - 231T cells ( Supplementary Fig . S5 ) . Although Nm23 showed only minor effect on reducing actin severing as compared with the control , its co - overexpression with Gelsolin resulted in a signi ﬁ cant inhibition of Gelsolin actin - severing activity ( 39 % in 4T1 , P ¼ 0 . 04 ; 47 % in MDA - MB - 231T , P ¼ 0 . 05 ) . These results indicate that Nm23 overexpres - sion and interaction with Gelsolin prevented its actin - sever - ing activity and modi ﬁ ed stress ﬁ ber formation . Moreover , when endogenous Nm23 - H1 expression was knocked down in MCF7 cells , actin severing increased 5 - fold as compared with the control cells ( Fig . 3G ) , thus con ﬁ rming its involvement in this process . Effects on tumor motility Because actin cytoskeleton reorganization is important for cell shape and motility , Gelsolin has crucial roles in the control of these cellular functions . The effects of Gelsolin on tumor cell motility are complex ( 29 , 37 ) . We observed distinct patterns of in vitro motility upon Gelsolin overexpression . Gelsolin over - expression promoted cell migration in presence of growth factors such as EGF ( 27 ) and insulin ( 26 ) , whereas no effect was observed when other chemoattractants such as LPA ( 38 ) and 1 % FBS were used ( Supplementary Fig . S6A and S6B ) . Motility toEGFwasselected forfurtherexperiments , using4T1 and MDA - MB - 231T cells overexpressing Nm23 , Gelsolin , or both proteins ( Fig . 4 ) . Overexpression of Gelsolin in 4T1 cells enhanced cell migration by 58 % ( P ¼ 0 . 03 ) , whereas Nm23 reduced it by 46 % ( P ¼ 0 . 02 ) , as compared with vector - transfected cells . Cells overexpressing both proteins showed 50 % reduction in motility compared the Gelsolin - expressing cells ( P ¼ 0 . 03 ; Fig . 4A ) . MDA - MB - 231T cells expressing Nm23 , Gelsolin , or both proteins were also assayed . Cell migration was increased by 64 % after Gelsolin overexpression , whereas it was reduced by 37 % after Nm23 - H1 overexpression as compared with the vector ( P ¼ 0 . 005 and 0 . 0009 , respec - tively ) . The co - overexpression of Nm23 - H1 – Gelsolin reversed the Gelsolin phenotype , reducing motility by 53 % compared with Gelsolin - expressing cells ( P ¼ 0 . 02 ; Fig . 4B ) . Thus , Nm23 inhibits the motility - promoting effects of Gelsolin , consistent with its abrogation of Gelsolin ' s actin - severing ability . In addition , knockdown of endogenous Nm23 - H1 from MCF7 cells resulted in 4 . 8 - fold increase in motility ( P ¼ 0 . 04 ; Sup - plementary Fig . S6C ) . Knockdown of Gelsolin in the vector - expressing MDA - MB - 231T cells showed a 37 % decreased motility ( P ¼ 0 . 03 ) ; it had no effect on motility in the Nm23 - H1 – expressing cells ( Fig . 4C ) . Other in vitro assays were conducted . No signi ﬁ cant effect of Nm23 or Gelsolin overexpression on proliferation of 4T1 or MDA - MB - 231T cells was observed in MTT assays ( Fig . 4D and E ) . No effect of the Nm23 or Gelsolin overexpression on apoptosis was observed ( Supplementary Fig . S7 ) . Nm23 overexpression reduced Gelsolin ' s potentiation of tumor metastasis To evaluate the in vivo effects of Nm23 - H1 and Gelsolin overexpression , 4T1 cells overexpressing either a vector or Gelsolin , and either a vector or Nm23 - H1 were implanted into the mfp of syngeneic Balb / c mice . Differences in tumor growth between the cells were observed ( Fig . 5A ) . In accord with its tumorigenic property in breast cancer ( 22 , 23 ) , Gelsolin - over - expressing 4T1 cells showed increased tumor growth , which was reversed when Nm23 - H1 was co - overexpressed .

Surface experi - mental metastases declined 55 % to 9 in Nm23 - H1 – over - expressing arm .

After paraf ﬁ n - embedding and sectioning the lungs , H & E staining was conducted to visualize and count histologic metastases . This quanti ﬁ cation of metastatic burden con - ﬁ rmed the surface metastasis ﬁ ndings : Gelsolin expression induced a 53 . 2 % increase in metastasis formation ( P ¼ 0 . 041 ) , whereas Nm23 - H1 reduced the number of lung metastases by 74 . 1 % ( P ¼ 0 . 035 ) as compared with the vector ( Fig . 6B ) .

No difference in proliferation was observed in metastatic lesions between the experimental groups ( Fig . 6C ) . Discussion Although Nm23 - H1 has been thoroughly validated as a metastasis suppressor in solid tumors , its mechanism of action remains elusive ( 5 ) . Protein – protein interactions involving Nm23 have been widely reported ( 7 ) , but few have been independently con ﬁ rmed and , likewise , few modulate Nm23 ' s hallmark phenotype of tumor cell motility . We conducted an unbiasedsearchforNm23 - H1 - and - M1 – bindingproteinsusing MS - MS sequencing of coimmunoprecipitating proteins from 4T1 lysates , primary tumors , and metastases . Of the Nm23 - binding proteins identi ﬁ ed from primary tumors , several are intimately connected to cellular motility , including Ezrin , Arp2 / 3 , and Gelsolin . The interaction of Nm23 - H1 and each of these proteins was undetectable in lymph nodes , liver , and spleen metastases from the same model system , which may re ﬂ ect the downregulation of Nm23 - H1 expression in meta - static lesions ( 39 ) , leading to the loss of an association and unhindered function of the binding protein .

CAN - 13 - 0368 MDA - MB - 435 carcinoma cells and HEK293TN immortalized kidney cells con ﬁ rmed the association of Nm23 and Gelsolin . CoimmunoprecipitationofthetwoproteinsatendogenouslevelswasobservedinhumanMCF7breastcarcinomacells , which expressrelativelyhighlevelsofNm23 - H1 . Itremainspossiblethat additional proteins are part of the Nm23 - H1 – Gelsolin complex ; the prometastatic protein Prune has been reported to be a binding partner of each protein , for instance ( 40 , 41 ) . Gelsolin is traditionally understood as an actin - binding protein . It severs and caps ends of actin ﬁ laments in a Ca þþ – regulated manner , providing for dynamic actin assem - bly and disassembly in normal cell elasticity and in the leading and lagging aspects of cell motility . Less well understood are Gelsolin ' s protein – protein interactions with p53 ( 21 ) , hormone receptors ( 18 , 20 ) , and other proteins ( 19 ) , a lipid regulatory activity ( 15 ) , and the apoptosis - inducing activity of its N - terminal fragment ( 16 ) . Using lysates of 4T1 and MDA - MB - 231T breast carcinoma cells transfected with either vector , Nm23 - H1 , Gelsolin , or Nm23 - H1 / Gelsolin , enzymatic assays for actin polymerization and depolymerization were con - ducted . Consistent with the literature , Gelsolin overexpression had no effect on actin polymerization , but augmented its depolymerization . It is not known whether Gelsolin directly severed the actin ﬁ laments in the assay , or capped ﬁ laments severed by other enzymes . In agreement with an interaction between Nm23 - H1 and Gelsolin , co - overexpression of both proteins abrogated Gelsolin ' s depolymerization ability . Fur - thermore , after knocking down endogenous Nm23 - H1 in MCF7 cells , an increase in actin severing was observed , con ﬁ rming that Nm23 - H1 may affect Gelsolin function . The data indicate a functional consequence of the Nm23 - H1 – Gelsolin interaction . Our coimmuno ﬂ ourescence data point to an interaction of Gelsolin and Nm23 - H1 in the perinuclear cytoplasm , permitting the hypothesis that Nm23 - H1 and Gelsolin interact to regulate stress ﬁ ber formation , which occurs in this area . In experiments carried out using MDA - MB - 231T cells , Nm23 - H1 coimmunoprecipitated a trans - fected C - terminal portion of Gelsolin . This region has a single actin - binding site and regulates Gelsolin ' s activity ( 8 ) , whereas its actual actin - severing activity is localized to Gelsolin ' s N - terminus . Consistent with Gelsolin ' s role in actin dynamics , its over - expression has been reported widely to increase tumor cell motility and invasion or , conversely , its knockdown to inhibit motility ( 14 , 26 – 28 ) . In both the 4T1 and MDA - MB - 231T model systems , we con ﬁ rmed a stimulation of tumor cell motility by Gelsolin overexpression . The stimulatory effect of Gelsolin was abrogated by co - overexpression of Nm23 , consistent with their binding and inactivation of actin depolymerization . Furthermore , while knockdown of endogenous Nm23 - H1 in MCF7 cells resulted in increased motility , the knockdown of Gelsolin in Nm23 - H1 - overexpressing MDA - MB - 231T cells showed no effect on cell migration , suggesting that the func - tional interaction is unidirectional in effect , that is , Gelsolin may not affect Nm23 function . We did not observe any evidence for a proapoptotic role of the transfected Gelsolin , but cannot rule out that other of its functions could also be contributory . In the face of Gelsolin ' s role in actin dynamics and tumor cell motility , in vivo data in the literature on the phenotypic consequences of its altered expression are both sparse and puzzling . Three reports showed a suppressive effect of Gelsolin overexpression , either wild - type or a Pro321 ! His mutation , on primary tumor formation ( 42 – 44 ) . A lipid metabolism role of Gelsolin was implicated in its tumor - suppressive phenotype . We observed an increased in pri - mary tumor size upon Gelsolin overexpression ( 22 , 23 ) . For metastasis , only one report has been published and it shows a surprising metastasis suppressive role for Gelsolin over - expression in B16 melanoma cells ( 29 ) . This report stands in sharp contrast to two model systems reported herein , in which Gelsolin overexpression augmented 4T1 spontaneous metastasis to the lungs and liver , and experimental MDA - MB - 231T metastasis to the lungs . The reason ( s ) for the discrepancy are unclear . Gelsolin overexpression in the B16 model was modest , and it is possible that its relative expression level can alter actin dynamics to produce diver - gent phenotypes . Other Gelsolin family members exert sim - ilar functions ( 27 ) . In agreement with the coimmunopreci - pitation of Gelsolin and Nm23 - H1 , and Nm23 - H1 ' s abro - gation of Gelsolin ' s actin - depolymerization and motility induction properties , co - overexpression of Nm23 - H1 reduced the metastasis - stimulatory phenotype of Gelsolin . Taken together , the data permit the hypothesis on a mech - anism of action for Nm23 - H1 metastasis suppression : an Nm23 - H1 interaction with Gelsolin limits actin - depolymer - ization and dynamic function , thereby attenuating metas - tasis in breast cancer model systems .
