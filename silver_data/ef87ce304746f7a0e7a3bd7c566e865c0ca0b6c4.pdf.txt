TYPE Review PUBLISHED 18 October 2022 DOI 10 . 3389 / fonc . 2022 . 1007446 Introduction The cell plasma membrane ( PM ) made of glycerophospholipids separates the inner and outer parts of the cell . Under physiological conditions , it acts as a gatekeeper to protect cells from the environment ( 1 ) . In pathological situations , it undergoes structural and functional changes , resulting in cell damage ( 2 ) . According to the recommendations of the Nomenclature Committee on Cell Death , cell death can be divided into accidental cell death ( ACD ) and regulated cell death ( RCD ) ; the latter , also called “ active ” cell death , can be further classi ﬁ ed into apoptotic and non - apoptotic cell death with different morphological , genetic , and biochemical characteristics ( 3 ) . Non - apoptotic cell death , such as necroptosis ( 4 ) , pyroptosis ( 5 ) , and ferroptosis ( 6 , 7 ) , triggers various types of plasma membrane damage to suppress tumor growth and could be used in the treatment of cancer against apoptosis resistance . Apoptosis , necroptosis , and pyroptosis all feature a passive “ suicide ” form promoting molecular processes and form a few nanometers of plasma membrane pores , leading to a catastrophic bursting of the cell ( 8 ) . A rise in cytosolic calcium ( Ca 2 + ) has been related to the execution of different cell death processes , including apoptosis , necroptosis , pyroptosis , and unregulated necrosis ( 9 ) . Apoptosis involves fragmentation and margination of chromatin , as well as generation of apoptotic bodies and plasma membrane blebbing ( 10 ) . Necroptosis has been demonstrated to involve swelling of cells and was shown to be associated with the generation of released plasma membrane broken pieces as vesicles . Necrotic cells lose the integrity of the plasma membrane and thereby release intracellular damage - associated molecular patterns . Necroptosis signaling can be switched from apoptosis through anti - caspase mechanisms such as genetic ablation of caspase - 8 ( 11 ) . Pyroptosis relies on the protein gasdermin D ( GSDMD ) to precede rapid necrotic cell death by intensive blebbing . However , such features have not been observed during ferroptosis . Correspondingly , ferroptosis damages the active cell integrity with the accumulation of lipid peroxides due to a defective antioxidant response of the cell ( 12 ) . However , cells undergoing necroptosis do not always die . The known repair mechanisms involving the endosomal sorting complex required for transport ( ESCRT ) machinery outward vesiculates or sheds damaged membranes ( 13 ) and plays a critical counterbalancing role in sorting and downregulating activated cell - surface receptors ( 14 ) and repairing damaged plasma membranes to maintain membrane integrity ( 15 ) , thus delaying cell death pathways , including apoptosis ( 16 ) , necroptosis ( 17 ) , pyroptosis ( 18 , 19 ) , ferroptosis ( 20 ) , autophagy ( 21 ) , and endosomal processing ( 22 ) . In this review , we summarized the relationship between the ESCRT pathway and regulated cell death , aiming to identify ESCRT as a potential target to overcome drug resistance during tumor therapy . Summary of ESCRT function in cell death ESCRT components are implicated in cellular events such as viral budding , cell signaling regulation ( 23 ) , modulation of cytokine release , communication with immune cells ( 24 ) , vesicle budding , and sustained cell viability and survival ( 25 , 26 ) . Four different multimeric protein complexes comprise ESCRT - 0 to ESCRT - III machinery sequentially recruited from the cytoplasm to the endosomal membrane : ESCRT - 0 ( Vps27 ) , ESCRT - I ( Vps23 , Vps28 , Vps37 , MVB12 ) , ESCRT - II ( Vps22 , Vps25 , Vps36 ) , and ESCRT - III ( Did2 , Vps2 , Vps20 , Vps24 , Snf7 , Vps60 , Chm7 , Ist1 ) . Another ESCRT machinery - functioning subcomplex , the AAA - ATPase complex vacuolar protein sorting - associated 4 ( VPS4 ) and apoptosis - linked gene 2 ( ALG - 2 ) – interacting protein X ( ALIX ) protein , are potential decisive factors in the function of ESCRT - I and ESCRT - II . The ESCRT machinery mediates the “ reverse - topology ” cellular membrane scission mechanism ( 27 ) to process membrane remodeling , including cytokinesis , plasma membrane and lysosomal membrane repair , and nuclear envelope reformation ( 22 ) . ESCRT - 0 triggered by Ca 2 + in ﬂ ux recruits other ESCRT machinery to endosomes during multivesicular body formation ( MVB ) sorting . Then , ESCRT - I binds ubiquitinated cargo and canonically activates ESCRT - II recruitment . ESCRT - III assembly starts with Vps20 , followed by the core polymer subunits Vps2 and Vps24 binding Snf7 in tandem and ﬁ nally recruiting VPS4 , which dissociates the ESCRT structure from the endosomal membrane ( 28 – 31 ) . Subsequently , the assembly of ESCRT - III machinery was recruited to wounds , assembled on the inner surface of the membrane neck to form single - or multiple - stranded polymorphic ﬁ laments shapes from spirals ( 32 , 33 ) to conical spirals ( 34 ) and tubular helices ( 35 ) , and then broken down within the lysosomal lumen to create plasma membrane blebs and intraluminal vesicles ( ILVs ) ( 36 ) , mediate membrane scission , remove damaged parts of cell membranes away from the cytoplasm ( 27 ) , and shed off the extracellular space . ESCRT - I , ESCRT - II , ESCRT - III , VPS4A , and ALIX were recruited to damaged lysosomes and mediated lysosomal membrane repair . In mammalian cells , the ESCRT - III complex consists of 12 subunits : charged multivesicular body protein 1A ( CHMP1A ) , CHMP1B , CHMP2A , CHMP2B , CHMP3 , CHMP4A , CHMP4B , CHMP4C , CHMP5 , CHMP6 , CHMP7 , and increased sodium tolerance 1 ( IST1 ) ( 37 ) . ESCRT - III plays a key role in the repair of damaged plasma membranes in various types of regulated cell death , such as necroptosis , pyroptosis , and ferroptosis . The inhibition of ESCRT - III machinery through genetic depletion of its core components increases susceptibility to anticancer agent - induced cell death ( 1 ) , indicating that ESCRT III is a potential target to overcome drug resistance during tumor therapy . Yang et al . 10 . 3389 / fonc . 2022 . 1007446 Frontiers in Oncology frontiersin . org 02 Apoptosis Apoptosis is the most extensively investigated type of regulated cell death characterized by the sequential activation of cysteine - aspartic protease caspases ( 12 ) . It is composed of the extrinsic and intrinsic major pathways that activate and cleave the downstream “ executioner ” caspase - 3 and “ initiator ” caspase - 7 . Bcl - 2 family effector proteins speci ﬁ c effector molecules B - cell / CLL lymphoma 2 ( BCL2 ) - associated protein X ( Bax ) aBak and Bok ( 19 , 38 ) regulated the integrity of the outer mitochondrial membrane permeabilization , releasing proteins of the mitochondrial intermembrane space into the cytosol . The intrinsic endolysosomal pathway in cellular stress ( 39 ) is enriched in phagosomes , and exosomes dominate the control of membrane budding and scission ( 36 ) to control apoptosis ( 40 ) in response to DNA damage ( 41 ) . The extrinsic pathway is activated upon the binding of extracellular ligands to cell surface death receptors . The ESCRT machinery components apoptosis - linked gene - 2 ( ALG - 2 ) and exosomes interact with apoptosis - linked gene interacting protein X ( ALIX ) and are suggested to be a bridge between the endolysosomal system and apoptosis . ALG - 2 is a penta - EF - hand protein enriched in phagosomes , also known as programmed cell death 6 – interacting protein ( PDCD6IP ) , which is regarded as apoptotic machinery in T - cell lines ( 42 ) and participates in T - cell receptor - , Fas - , and glucocorticoid - induced programmed cell death . ALIX interacts with Cbl - interacting protein of 85 kDa ( CIN85 ) / SRC homology 3 ( SH3 ) and sensitizes astrocytes to apoptosis in response to DNA damage ( 43 , 44 ) . The ALIX – ALG - 2 complex undergoes apoptosis in a Ca2 + / K + - dependent manner ( 45 ) , while these events individually do not activate the downstream caspase cascade to eventually lead to apoptosis . Tumor susceptibility gene 101 ( TSG101 ) is an ESCRT - 1 protein homologue of the yeast class E VPS protein complex ESCRT - III ( 46 ) that directly participates in mitigating ER stress - mediated apoptosis . The association of TSG 101 with ALIX prevents predisposition to apoptosis , but deregulating cytosolic Ca 2 + and upregulating the levels of ALG - 2 could disrupt this process . In healthy cells , when cytosolic Ca 2 + is low , mahogunin RING ﬁ nger 1 ( MGRN1 ) - mediated ubiquitination of the ESCRT - I protein tumor susceptibility gene 101 ( TSG101 ) promotes amphisomal – lysosomal and endolysosomal degradation pathways ( 47 , 48 ) and helps maintain low levels of ALIX and ALG - 2 as well as cell viability . MGRN1 depletion leads to cell surface glycoprotein mammalian PrP ( Ctm PrP ) - mediated ER stress , and an increase in cytosolic Ca 2 + results in the ALIX – ALG - 2 protein interaction . Overexpression of TSG101 also increases ALIX and ALG - 2 levels , eventually eliciting predisposition to death in selected brain regions or myocardial apoptosis during embryonic development ( 16 ) . Under pathological conditions , the ESCRT - III - associated protein CHMP4B could also interact with ALIX - ALG - 2 and participate in the endolysosomal system or cell apoptosis . CHMP4B mutation prevented early programmed cell death caused by overexpression of ALIX ( 49 ) . However , increasing CHMP4B levels were accompanied by the upregulation of Fas receptor ( Fas ) , Fas ligand ( FasL ) , active caspase - 8 , and caspase - 3 in neurons , which implicated a proapoptotic function in neuronal cells induced by hemin stimulation following intracerebral hemorrhage ( ICH ) via the extrinsic apoptotic pathway ( 50 ) ( Figure 1 and Table 1 ) . Necroptosis Necroptosis is characterized by permeability and ﬁ nally plasma membrane rupturing in necrotic cells , different from shrinking and blebbing of plasma membranes in apoptotic cells ( 4 , 19 ) . Phosphatidylserine ( PS ) is localized to the inner lea ﬂ et of the plasma membrane of healthy cells , and exposure revealed small plasma membrane ( PM ) “ bubbles ” of broken plasma membrane released from the cell surface . Phospholipid scrambling ( exposing PS ) and disrupting plasma membrane integrity dominated the initial extracellular death signals and initiated necroptosis . Necroptosis can be mediated by tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF a ) and / or Fas or activated by the execution of necroptosis receptor - interacting kinase - 1 ( RIPK1 ) / RIPK3 - mediated phosphorylation of mixed lineage kinase domains such as pseudokinase ( MLKL ) ( 24 , 52 ) . MLKL plays a critical role in tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) - induced necroptosis via interaction with receptor - interacting protein 3 ( RIP3 ) . MLKL oligomerization - mediated PM disruption occurs prior to the loss of PM integrity , resulting in a rapid Ca 2 + in ﬂ ux into the cell ( 17 , 80 ) and induced bubbles , thus making the core machinery of the unique “ membrane - explosive ” necroptosis cell death pathway ( 80 ) . However , cells that are exposed to PS upon MLKL activation can be “ resuscitated ” and survive . The calcium - dependent ESCRT - III machinery plays a wider role in modulating various types of RCD by delaying cell membrane rupture . Sustained viability by ESCRT can either antagonize ( pyroptosis ) or enhance ( necroptosis ) the release of signaling events upstream of terminal effector activation ( 81 ) . ESCRT - III greatly delayed the time required for active MLKL to disrupt plasma membrane integrity and the onset of membrane permeabilization , sustained the integrity of the plasma membrane , and enhanced necroptosis bubble formation , therefore sustaining survival of the cell ( 17 , 82 ) . When MLKL activation is subsequently halted , cells have suf ﬁ cient time to permit surrounding cells to activate intracellular signaling pathways such as the cytokines C – X – C motif chemokine ligand 1 ( CXCL1 ) and CXCL10 ( 80 ) . Previous studies have Yang et al . 10 . 3389 / fonc . 2022 . 1007446 Frontiers in Oncology frontiersin . org 03 indicated that the ESCRT pathway can remove phospho - MLKL – containing membrane vesicles from cells and block necroptosis , and CHMP4B decreases necroptosis through different transcriptional activators ( 24 , 83 ) . MLKL localizes to sites of broken membrane bubbles with the requirement of extracellular Ca 2 + , and ESCRT - III components CHMP2A or CHMP4B are then recruited and reduce cell membrane damage caused by p - MLKL , thus preserving survival despite MLKL activation in kidney transplantation ( 17 , 25 ) . The presence of the N - terminal ubiquitin - binding UEV domain in TSG101 and the disassembly complex VPS4B is critical in promoting ALIX - syntenin 1 - mediated scission and for association with MLKL to delay necroptotic cell death ( 84 ) . Forkhead transcription factor O1 ( FOXO1 ) binds to the speci ﬁ c region on the CHMP4B promoter , and enhanced CHMP4B alleviates necroptosis in microglia by binding to the promoter region , resulting in decreased expression of RIP3 and p - MLKL and protecting against cell death after traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) , thus improving neurological function recovery ( 51 ) . On the other hand , the activation of necroptosis might alter the expression levels of ESCRT III proteins as a compensatory mechanism . CHMP2B is a marker for granulovacuolar degeneration ( GVD ) bodies in the Alzheimer ’ s disease ( AD ) brain ( 85 ) . A signi ﬁ cantly increased expression of CHMP2B , CHMP3 , and VPS4B was shown in pMLKL + neurons and counterbalanced necroptosis ( 53 ) . CHMP2B mutation was associated with neurodegeneration in frontotemporal dementia ( FTD ) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) ( 86 ) ( Figure 1 and Table 1 ) . FIGURE 1 The relationship between the ESCRT pathway and regulated cell death . The endosomal sorting complex required for transport ( ESCRT ) machinery participates in the following regulated cell death : apoptosis , necroptosis , pyroptosis , ferroptosis and autophagy . ESCRT - I overexpression and ESCRT - III - associated charged multivesicular body protein ( CHMP ) 4B participate in apoptosis , and ESCRT - 1 protein TSG 101 maintains low levels of ALIX and ALG - 2 and prevents predisposition to apoptosis . The ESCRT - III components CHMP2A and CHMP4B are recruited to broken membrane bubble sites with the requirement of extracellular Ca2 + , remove membrane vesicles from cells , and delay the time required for active MLKL to mediate necroptosis , thus preserving cell survival .

Caspase - 1 , caspase - 4 , caspase - 5 , and caspase - 11 cleave GSDMD , release the N - terminal domain , and then translocate into the plasma membrane . While components of ESCRT - III mainly repaired the plasma membrane damage and function in preserving cell survival when the activity of the effectors is suf ﬁ ciently low or the engaged pathway is disrupted prior to lysis ( 87 ) . During pyroptosis , after cytosolic caspases cleave GSDMD to form nanoscale ( 10 – 15 - nm ) membrane pores , CHMP4B is recruited to the plasma membrane and clusters around the neck to remove the GSDMD pores and preserve plasma membrane integrity , thus limiting proin ﬂ ammatory cytokine interleukin - 1 b ( IL - 1 b ) and IL - 18 release through GSDMD pores ( 19 ) , which rely on the in ﬂ ux of Ca 2 + . In contrast , VPS4B ATPase is activated to dismantle the ESCRT - III complex after membrane scission . Knockdown of CHMP3 enhances GSDMD - mediated pyroptosis . Recently , Kai et al . revealed that Ca 2 + and K + in ﬂ ux as well as activation of NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 ( NLRP3 ) - dependent IL - 1 b release resulted in pyroptosis , and Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb ) infection spread to neighboring cells . Upon NLRP3 in ﬂ ammasome activation , ESCRT composite ALG - 2 and ALIX recruitment repaired plasma membrane damage in macrophages ( 54 ) ( Figure 1 and Table 1 ) . Ferroptosis Ferroptosis is a caspase - independent form of regulated pathological necroin ﬂ ammation ( 56 ) and activation of the innate immune system , causing cell metabolic state changes involving cell enlargement , organelle swelling , membrane rupture , mitochondrial shrinkage , and increased outer membrane density ( 52 , 88 ) . Ferroptosis proceeds even in the absence of key effectors of apoptosis ( Bax , Bak , and caspases ) or necroptosis ( MLKL , RIPK1 , and RIPK3 ) ( 89 ) . Cells dying by ferroptosis primarily exhibit shrunken and damaged mitochondria by electron microscopy , with few other morphological changes evident prior to the point of cell death ( 90 , 91 ) . The ferroptosis pathway occurs in cells involving targeting the amino acid antiporter system xc – or iron transport molecule shuttles such as transferrin ( 92 ) and lactotransferrin ( 93 ) or is activated after intracellular antioxidant enzymes are blocked ( 94 ) . Glutathione peroxidase 4 ( GPX4 ) is the best - characterized trigger of ferroptosis .

Then , iron - dependent membrane phospholipid hydroperoxide accumulation precedes a sustained increase in cytosolic Ca 2 + ( 95 , 96 ) , ultimately forming nanopores to trigger plasma membrane rupture and release of intracellular components ( 97 ) . ESCRT - III - dependent membrane repair blocks ferroptosis through association with the plasma membrane model and acts as a protective mechanism ( 20 ) . The accumulation of the ESCRT - III subunits CHMP5 and CHMP6 in the plasma membrane is increased by the classical ferroptosis activators erastin - 1 and RSL3 , and the increase in cytosolic calcium in ﬂ ux relies on endoplasmic reticulum stress . CHMP5 or CHMP6 depletion increases erastin - and RSL3 - induced ferroptosis ( 98 ) . ESCRT - III is recruited to the plasma membrane to form CHMP4B puncta , removing pores from the plasma membrane , shedding them in ectosomes , and reducing lipid peroxidation as well as DAMP release , causing damaged membrane sections to be removed by endocytosis to delay ferroptosis membrane damage ( 81 , 98 – 100 ) . ESCRT - III also impacts cytokine secretion in ferroptotic cells ( 20 ) . Apoptosis - inducing factor mitochondria - associated 2 ( AIFM2 ) - dependent ESCRT - III recruitment regulates membrane budding , ﬁ ssion , and repair and blocks erastin - and RSL3 - induced ferroptotic cancer cell death , which is responsible for ferroptosis resistance ( 101 ) ( Figure 1 and Table 1 ) . Autophagy Autophagy is a catabolic lysosomal degradation pathway responsible for nutrient recycling , protein and organelle quality control , and degradation and recycling of cellular material to maintain cell homeostasis and cope with stressful conditions ( 21 ) . Autophagy is characterized by phagophores forming a small crescent - shaped membrane that stretches and seals cytoplasmic cargoes in double - membrane autophagosomes ( 21 ) . Autophagosomes are nucleated from endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) sites called omegasomes by phosphatidyl inositol 3 phosphate ( PI3P ) kinase complex class III and PI3P - binding proteins . Autophagosomes can fuse with early endosomes and MVBs to generate an intermediate compartment , the amphisome , which ultimately fuses with lysosomes ( 102 ) . There are three most degradative systems types : the ubiquitin proteasome system , endocytosis , and autophagy vesicular processes converging on the lysosome ( 102 ) . Lysosomes originate from endolysosomes or autolysosomes , act as single membrane - bound organelles , and recycle cellular nutrients through the outer membrane of mature autophagosomes and release acid hydrolases to degrade the autophagosomal content ; they are also critical junctures between autophagy and endocytosis ( 103 ) as well as essential processes for maintaining intracellular homeostasis . ESCRT participates in four coexisting types of autophagy processes in a cell , namely , the recycling of cytosolic components by macroautophagy ( often simply called autophagy ) , endosomal microautophagy , chaperone - mediated autophagy ( CMA ) , and lysosomal and autophagic cell death pathways , ultimately directed to the lysosome for degradation ( 104 ) . In macroautophagy , autophagic substrates are transported to the vacuole by autophagosomes with double - membrane structures ; in microautophagy , substrates are directly engulfed by the vacuolar membrane . Macroautophagy Macroautophagy is the main cytosolic degradative system involved in the formation of preautophagosomal structures called omegasomes ( 105 ) . Autophagosome formation fuses with the lysosome to form an autolysosome , including extending , closing , and fusioning the isolation membrane ( IM ) dependent on autophagy - related ( ATG ) proteins to enwrap cargoes , thus initiating the macroautophagy degradation pathway characterized by double - membrane vesicles , termed autophagosome maturation , and encompassing multiple lysosomal - dependent mechanisms . The ESCRT machinery rescued slightly damaged lysosomes , and the ESCRT machinery and ATG proteins interact between endocytosis and macroautophagy to form a bridge between the endolysosomal system and cell death ( 82 , 106 ) . ATG12 - ATG5 is needed under starvation conditions , while ATG12 - ATG3 is required under nutrient - rich conditions ( 57 , 58 ) . Autophagosome closure requires a similar membrane scission machinery as ESCRT - III ( 107 ) . ATG8 / microtubule - associated protein 1 light chain 3 ( MAP1LC3 ) - I / II is a key player in autophagosomal extension . Upon closure , LC3 - II on the outer autophagosomal membrane ( OAM ) is delipidated and released to the cytosol , while LC3 - II associated with the inner autophagosomal membrane ( IAM ) is degraded upon autophagosome – lysosome fusion ( 59 ) . Autophagosomal membranes can serve as activation platforms for intracellular death - inducing signaling complexes ( iDISCs ) to initiate caspase - 8 - dependent apoptosis . Mutations in ESCRT I ( TSG101 and VPS28 ) , II ( SNF8 , VPS22 , VPS25 ) , and III ( VPS32 ) affected fusion between endosome and autophagosome accumulation to produce amphisomes ( 48 , 60 ) . The ESCRT - I subunit VPS28 variant mediated a negative effect on autophagosome closure and autophagic substrate degradation ( 108 ) . The ESCRT component AAA - ATPase VPS4 is responsible for OAM and IAM abscission and closure to form functional autolysosomes ( 61 ) as well as dissociate the ESCRT machinery from the endosomal membrane ( 60 ) . Prior to lysosomal recruitment , the autophagosome closure regulator ESCRT - III component CHMP2A is recruited to the double - membrane autophagosome and mediates “ reverse - topology ” membrane Yang et al . 10 . 3389 / fonc . 2022 . 1007446 Frontiers in Oncology frontiersin . org 08 ﬁ ssion ( 61 , 62 ) , capping the assembled inner surface of the membrane neck with CHMP3 to drive membrane scission from the cytoplasm , shape MVB formation , and cut the membrane , and nuclear envelope reformation and remodeling processes involve regulating membrane ﬁ ssion phagophore closure ( 22 , 61 , 63 , 109 ) . CHMP2A depletion or mutation induces iDISC - mediated non - canonical caspase - 8 activation on immature autophagosomal membranes and leads to ATG5 - and LC3 - II - positive phagophore accumulation , and redirects protumorigenic autophagy to apoptosis in osteosarcoma and neuroblastoma cells , thus inhibiting mouse xenograft model tumor growth ( 109 – 111 ) , which may open new avenues for therapeutic targeting of autophagy in cancer . Prior to ﬁ nal fusion with lysosomes , CHMP4B associated with the ALIX – ALG - 2 complex was recruited to promote endosome maturation , permitting subsequent fusion between autophagosomes and MVBs to modulate the membrane ( 49 , 64 , 65 , 112 ) . ESCRT - III Snf7 / Vps32 inactivation leads to the accumulation of autophagosomes , probably due to a blockage of autophagic ﬂ ux in HeLa cells in the late stage of autophagosome formation ( 63 , 66 ) . Starvation - induced ESCRT - III components ( CHMP2A , CHMP2B , CHMP3 , CHMP7 , and CEP55 ) as well as VPS4 acted as potential regulators of phagophore closure , dissociated from the autophagic membrane , participated in nuclear envelope reformation , and directly mediated membrane scission in human bone osteosarcoma epithelial cells ( U - 2 OS ) , HeLa cells , and human retinal pigment ephitilial - 1 cells under basal and starved conditions ( 61 , 67 – 69 ) . The CHMP2B mutant in primary neurons also leads to autophagosome and multilamellar body accumulation , resulting in neuronal cell loss ( 63 ) . The accumulation of autophagosomes in plant ESCRT mutants may result from inef ﬁ cient closure of autophagosomes . The ESCRT - II subunit VPS36 localizes to endosomes and the plasma membrane . In Arabidopsis , autophagic turnover of plastids decreased in the ESCRT - related CHMP1 ( VPS46 ) mutant due to defects in phagophore maturation and transport ( 113 ) ( Figure 2 and Table 1 ) . Microautophagy Microautophagy requires membrane scission at the vacuolar membrane , similar to ILV formation at the MVE . Microautophagy occurs in the following three different membrane dynamics : protrusion of the lysosomal membrane to engulf the cargo , invagination of the lysosomal membrane or endosome to entrap the cargo inside the lysosome or endosomes ( 114 ) . The ESCRT machinery plays catabolic roles in cell starvation through the sorting and degradation of cytosolic proteins and lipids , similar to a hub - like system involved in the ﬁ nal maturation of both late endosomes and autophagosomes . ESCRT participates in plasma membrane scission as well as in cytosolic components , proteins , and lipids during starvation and affects the fusion of vesicles with lysosomes to form autolysosomes ( 115 , 116 ) . Upon ER stress - induced macrolipophagy in budding yeast , the whole ESCRT machinery is recruited to the scission site on the vacuolar membrane and lipid droplets to remove the ER whorls and Snf7 , thus clearing the defective proteasomes ( 117 ) . The ESCRT - 0 subunit Vps27 relocated to the vacuolar membrane after a diauxic shift upon glucose starvation and was recruited less ef ﬁ ciently to the vacuolar membrane ; endosomal target of rapamycin ( TOR ) signaling complexes ( TORC ) directly control ESCRT components to inhibit untimely autophagy events ( 70 , 71 ) . In mammalian cells , on the one hand , myosin VI directly interacts with the ESCRT - 0 Tom1 protein ; on the other hand , myosin VI interacts with autophagy adaptors and optineurin , which are involved in selective autophagy ( 72 , 73 ) . Heat shock protein family A ( Hsp70 ) member 1A ( HSPA1A ) is essential for regulating ESCRT - 0 / signal transducing adaptor molecule 2 ( STAM2 ) and protecting cells from cytotoxicity by blocking ESCRT - 0 - initiated autophagosome – lysosome fusion ( 74 ) , abolishing autophagic ﬂ ux in cellular thermoresistance , signi ﬁ cantly reducing thermal cytotoxicity , and promoting cell survival ( 75 ) ( Figure 2 and Table 1 ) . Lysophagy Lysophagy occurs only when the repair mechanism fails to be initiated due to extensive damage to the lysosomal membrane and the inability to recruit ESCRT repair complexes . Damaged lysosomes are selectively eliminated by lysophagy when ESCRT - mediated membrane repair fails ( 118 ) . Rescue of lysosomes mediated by ESCRT , removal of damaged lysosomes via lysophagy , and lysosome biogenesis can restore lysosome function and improve autophagic clearance ( 118 ) . ESCRT - mediated membrane remodeling may contribute to both immediate and delayed responses to lysosomal damage by the multivesicular body pathway ( 76 , 77 ) . ESCRT - III is recruited to damaged lysosomes , which requires ESCRT - I and ALIX . ESCRT - I , ESCRT - II , ESCRT - III , ALIX , and VPS4A are recruited to damaged lysosomes and precede lysophagy . TSG101 depletion inhibits CHMP4B recruitment to damaged lysosomes , whereas CHMP2A knockdown stabilizes CHMP4B . ESCRT recruitment protects cells against cell death caused by lysosome damage ( 78 , 79 ) . After membrane damage , ubiquitination is delayed by 30 min compared to the recruitment of ESCRT components ( 77 ) . Dampening ESCRT responses by depleting TSG101 and ALIX slows or completely blocks this rapid recovery and thereby implicates ESCRT function in lysosomal repair ( 119 , 120 ) ( Figure 2 and Table 1 ) . Yang et al . 10 . 3389 / fonc . 2022 . 1007446 Frontiers in Oncology frontiersin . org 09 ESCRT as a potential target for tumor therapy Tumor cells develop drug - resistance effects to escape cell death and cause treatment failure . ESCRT contributes to resistance to cell death and is generally regarded as a tumor - suppressor gene . The ESCRT - 0 protein Hrs was upregulated in tumor specimens of the stomach , colon , liver , cervix , and melanoma ( 121 ) . The ESCRT - I subunit Vps37A was signi ﬁ cantly reduced in the hepatocellular carcinoma cell line ( 122 ) . ESCRT - III subunit CHMP1A overexpression inhibited tumor xenograft growth of human pancreatic carcinoma cells ( 123 ) . Upregulation of CHMP3 was detected in non - small cell lung carcinoma ( 124 ) . CHMP5 or CHMP6 confers resistance to ferroptotic PANC1 and HepG2 human cancer cell death ( 98 ) . CHMP4C T232 is associated with increased susceptibility to cancer tumorigenesis in ovarian cancer ( 125 ) and male genital tract , prostate , and skin cancers ( 126 ) . Inhibition of these ESCRT proteins could block membrane remodeling and induce cancer cell death . In addition , observed from the uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma ( UCEC ) dataset of The Cancer Genome Atlas database ( TCGA ) database ( https : / / portal . gdc . cancer . gov / ) and GEPIA ( http : / / gepia . cancer - pku . cn / ) , the ESCRT - III components CHMP2A , CHMP4B , CHMP4C , CHMP5 , and CHMP6 were signi ﬁ cantly related to tumor - in ﬁ ltrating lymphocytes ( TILs ) , revealing that a deregulated ESCRT pathway would offer a potential target or effective markers in cancer immunotherapy . Discussion Apoptosis is a non - in ﬂ ammatory form of PCD mediated by activation of apoptotic caspases and can occur either via an extrinsic or an intrinsic pathway that converges on the activation of the executioner caspase - 3 , 6 , and 7 ( 12 ) . At the terminal stage FIGURE 2 Autophagy : the function between ESCRT and macroautophagy , microautophagy , and lysophagy . ESCRT - III - and VPS4 - induced macroautophagy is involved in the formation of autophagosomes : ATG12 - ATG5 is needed under starvation conditions , while ATG12 - ATG3 is required under nutrient - rich conditions . Upon closure , ATG8 / light chain 3 ( LC3 ) - II on the outer autophagosomal membrane ( OAM ) is delipidated and released to the cytosol , while LC3 - II associated with the inner autophagosomal membrane ( IAM ) is degraded upon autophagosome - lysosome fusion . ESCRT - 0 - and signal transducingadaptor molecule 2 ( STAM2 ) - initiated microautophagy requires membrane scission . ESCRT - I , ESCRT - II , ESCRT - III , ALIX , and VPS4A are recruited to damaged lysosomes and precede lysophagy . Yang et al . 10 . 3389 / fonc . 2022 . 1007446 Frontiers in Oncology frontiersin . org 10 of apoptosis , cells are phagocytosed in vivo by scavenger cells , such as macrophages or neutrophils . However , if these cells are not removed in a timely fashion , as is the case in vitro , they progress to a ﬁ nal phase called secondary necrosis characterized by cytoplasmic swelling and plasma membrane damage , similar to the phenotype of cells undergoing pyroptosis or necroptosis ( 8 , 9 ) . Necroptosis is triggered by the activation of receptor - interacting protein kinase - 3 ( RIPK3 ) , which phosphorylates the pseudokinase MLKL , causing it to translocate to the plasma membrane to induce cell permeabilization ( 56 ) . Pyroptosis is triggered primarily by activation of in ﬂ ammatory caspases , which include caspase - 1 and caspase - 11 ( caspase - 4 / - 5 in humans ) ( 19 ) . Autophagy is a process of bulk protein degradation in which cytoplasmic components , including organelles , are enclosed in double - membrane structures called autophagosomes and delivered to lysosomes or vacuoles for degradation ( 21 ) . The ESCRT machinery is involved in the above regulated cell death processes , such as apoptosis , necroptosis , pyroptosis , ferroptosis , and autophagy , in a Ca 2 + - dependent manner ( 47 , 48 ) . Ca 2 + in ﬂ ux plays an important role in the activation and recruitment of the ESCRT - III complex , leading to the repair of damaged plasma membranes during cell death . The ESCRT - 1 protein TSG 101 maintains low levels of ALIX and ALG - 2 and prevents predisposition to apoptosis ( 47 , 48 ) . ESCRT - III components CHMP2A or CHMP4B are recruited to the broken membrane bubble sites with the requirement of extracellular Ca 2 + , delaying the time required for active MLKL to mediate necroptosis and thus preserving cell survival despite MLKL ( 17 , 25 ) . Upon Ca 2 + and K + in ﬂ ux activating the NLRP3 in ﬂ ammasome , the ESCRT composites ALG - 2 , ALIX , and CHMP4B are recruited around the plasma membrane neck to remove the GSDMD pores and block pyroptosis and thus preserve plasma membrane integrity ( 19 , 54 ) . The accumulation of the ESCRT - III subunits CHMP5 and CHMP6 in the plasma membrane is increased by the classical ferroptosis activators erastin - 1 and ras - selective lethal small molecule 3 ( RSL3 ) upon cytosolic calcium in ﬂ ux and repairs the ferroptotic plasma membrane ( 98 ) . ESCRT is also involved in membrane scission machinery on autophagosome closure , and mutations in ESCRT I ( TSG101 and VPS28 ) , II ( SNF8 , VPS22 , VPS25 ) , and III ( VPS32 ) affect fusion between endosome and autophagosome accumulation to produce amphisomes ( 48 , 60 ) . Conclusion In summary , ESCRT provides time to the dying cell , and ESCRT - dependent membrane repair negatively regulates cell death : ESCRT - I and - III participate in apoptosis , ESCRT - III mediates necroptosis , pyroptosis , and ferroptosis , ESCRT - 0 initiates microautophagy , ESCRT - III induces macroautophagy , and ESCRT - I , - II , and - III precede lysophagy . All these types of cell death can cause plasma membrane damage through different mechanisms ; however , some essential mechanisms need to be clari ﬁ ed , such as the exact time point or target site ESCRT - rescued cell death , and it will be interesting to investigate the role of ESCRT as a potential target to overcome drug resistance in cancer cells .
