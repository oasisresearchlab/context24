It is strategy - proof if it logically precludes anyone ' s advantageously misrepresenting his preferences . It is unilateral if only one individual can affect the outcome , and duple if it restricts the final outcome to a fixed pair of alternatives . Any strategy - proof decision scheme , it is shown , is a probability mixture of schemes each of which is unilateral or duple . If it guarantees Pareto optimal outcomes , it is a probability mixture of dictatorial schemes . If it guarantees ex ante Pareto optimal lotteries , it is dictatorial . 1 . INTRODUCTION AN INDIVIDUAL manipulates a system of voting if , by misrepresenting his preferences , he secures a result he prefers to the result that would obtain if he expressed his true preferences . For systems of pure voting , where chance plays no role in settling which alternative is adopted , the following result is known : such a scheme , if it is to preclude individual strategic manipulation , must either make someone dictator , or restrict the possible outcome to a fixed pair of alternatives . ( See Gibbard [ 6 ] and Satterthwaite [ 13 ] ) . This paper deals with systems of voting of a more general kind : systems by which a social decision is made through a combination of voting and chance . It will be shown that any such scheme , if it is to preclude individual strategic manipulation , must be a probability mixture of schemes , each of which either ( i ) accords a monopoly of influence to a single voter , or ( ii ) restricts the final outcome to a fixed pair of alternatives . Schemes of the first kind I shall call unilateral ; of the second kind , duple . What is meant here by a combination of voting with chance ? Suppose a decision is made in the following way : first , voting of some kind is used to pick out a set of one or more winning alternatives ; then , in case there is more than one such winner , one of them is chosen by lot . Such a scheme , in effect , uses the way people vote to determine the probability each alternative has of being adopted . This I shall take as the defining feature of a scheme which combines voting with chance : on the basis of the way people vote , it assigns to each alternative a probability of being adopted . This paper deals only with voting by rank order ballot : in the schemes to be considered here , voting consists in each voter ' s ranking the alternatives in a professed order of preference . An individual is not allowed to express indifference between alternatives . The theorem in this paper applies to all systems of the kind I have characterized : to all systems by which voters ' rank order ballots - no ' I have been helped in revising this paper by conversations with Mark Satterthwaite , Thomas Schwartz , and Hugo Sonnenschein , and by letters from Peter Fishburn and Richard Zeckhauser . I am grateful to the referee for remarkably detailed suggestions for shortening the proof of the main theorem . 665 This content downloaded from 24 . 50 . 172 . 77 on Thu , 18 Jan 2018 02 : 53 : 46 UTC All use subject to http : / / about . jstor . org / terms 666 ALLAN GIBBARD indifference allowed - determine the probability of each alternative ' s being adopted . Systems of this kind will be called decision schemes , and they are defined , more precisely , as follows . Let there be a finite set of mutually exclusive alternatives , from which the community must select exactly one . Each voter ranks the alternatives on his ballot in professed order of preference . On the basis of these orderings , a probability of being adopted is assigned to each alternative , and the final choice is made by a suitable chance device . A decision scheme , then , is a function of the following kind . Let there be n voters , and let V be the set of mutually incompatible alternatives open to the community . Call an ordering of V with no tries a ranking and call an n - tuple of rankings a ranking n - tuple . Finally , let a lottery be an assignment of a probability to each alternative , with the probabilities adding up to one . A decision scheme is a function d whose domain is the set of all preference n - tuples , and whose values are lotteries . How can manipulability be defined for decision schemes ? A decision scheme is manipulable if there is a logically possible situation in which someone manipulates it , and an individual manipulates a decision scheme if , by misrepresenting his preferences , he secures a lottery he prefers to the lottery that would have obtained if he had expressed his true preferences . Whether he manipulates the scheme , then , depends on his preferences among lotteries . Now if an ordering of lotteries satisfies rationality conditions such as those of von Neumann and Morgenstern [ 8 , p . 26 ] , then it can most conveniently be given by an assignment of cardinal utilities to the alternatives . Whether individual k manipulates the scheme to his advan - tage , then , depends not only on the way everyone else votes , the way k votes , and the way k genuinely orders the alternatives ; it depends further on the way k genuinely orders lotteries - on k ' s cardinal utilities . Manipulability , then , can be characterized as follows . In the first place , k manipulates decision scheme d if ( i ) where the actual votes are given by ranking n - tuple ( P1 , . . . , Pn ) and k ' s true utility scale is U , k ' s avowed ranking Pk is not the ranking of the alternatives given by scale U , and ( ii ) if k had voted the ranking given by scale U , he would have secured a lottery of lower expected utility , as reckoned by U , than the lottery he actually secures . A decision scheme d is manipulable , then , if for some ranking n - tuple ( P1 , . . . . , Pn ) for some person k , and for some utility scale U , k manipulates d . If it is not manipulable , it will be called strategy - proof . These definitions are given explicitly in Section 4 . Unattractive examples of strategy - proof decision schemes are not hard to find . Here are three : SCHEME 1 : Put everyone ' s ballot in a hat , draw one at random , and choose the alternative which is ranked first on that ballot . ( For a discussion of this scheme , see Gibbard , [ 6 , pp . 592 - 593 ] , and Zeckhauser , [ 18 , pp . 938 - 940 ] . ) SCHEME 2 : First collect the ballots . Next , put the names of the alternatives in a hat and select two at random . Then use the collected ballots to decide between those two alternatives by majority vote . This amounts to a decision scheme , since under it , the ballots cast determine the probability of each alternative ' s being adopted . Now if a voter misrepresents his preferences under this scheme , it can This content downloaded from 24 . 50 . 172 . 77 on Thu , 18 Jan 2018 02 : 53 : 46 UTC All use subject to http : / / about . jstor . org / terms SCHEMES THAT MIX VOTING WITH CHANCE 667 affect the outcome only to his disadvantage . His misrepresentation can affect the outcome only if the following holds : for some pair of alternatives x and y , he prefers x to y but ranks y above x on his ballot , the names of x and y are drawn from the hat , and he swings the outcome from x to y by his vote - thus getting an outcome he likes less than the honest outcome . 2 SCHEME 3 : A coin is flipped , and Scheme 1 is used if the coin lands heads ; Scheme 2 if the coin lands tails . It might have been hoped that there were strategy - proof decision schemes more attractive than these : schemes , for instance , which select one or more optimal alternatives in a reasonable way on the basis of the way people vote , and then , in case there is more than one optimal alternative , choose the alternative actually to be adopted from among them by chance . The theorem in this paper shows , however , that all strategy - proof decision schemes are much like the unattractive schemes I have given as examples : all involve , in effect , selecting a ballot or a pair of alternatives by chance , and either ignoring all ballots but the one selected , or choosing somehow between the two selected alternatives . All , in other words , are probability mixtures of schemes , each of which is either unilateral or duple . The precise statement and proof of this theorem are given in Section 4 . Three corollaries are stated and proved in Section 5 . The first is this : suppose a decision scheme guarantees Pareto optimal outcomes . Suppose , in other words , that no matter how people vote , if one alternative is unanimously outranked by another , then it gets a probability of zero . Suppose also that there are at least three alternatives , and that the decision scheme is strategy - proof . Then the decision scheme is a probability mixture of dictatorial schemes . 3 The second corollary is this . Suppos & a decision scheme gives lotteries which are Pareto optimal ex ante , where a lottery is Pareto optimal ex ante if there is no other lottery which is unanimously preferred to it . Suppose , in other words , that no matter what each person ' s utility scale is , if each person votes the ranking of alternatives given by his utility scale , then the resulting lottery p has this property : there is no other lottery p ' which ranks higher than p on everyone ' s utility scale . Suppose , as before , that there are at least three alternatives , and that the decision scheme is strategy - proof . Then the decision scheme is dictatorial - it is not , that is to say , merely a probability mixture of dictatorial schemes ; it is itself dictatorial . This corollary extends to schemes which allow the expression of individual indifference . The third corollary is simply the earlier theorem on non - chance voting schemes [ 6 ] . The proof in this paper , then , constitutes a new proof of that earlier theorem . 2 Zeckhauser [ 18 , p . 939 ] describes an extension of the " random dictator system " as follows : " Provide each voter with q ballots for his first choice , r for his second , s for his third , etc . , with q > r > s . The selection procedure is random as before . " He goes on to say , " Thus we find that only variants of the random dictator system will elicit ballots unique with respect to individuals ' . . . ordinal prefer - ences . " ( Being ' unique ' in Zeckhauser ' s terminology is roughly the same as being " strategy - proof " in mine ) . If by " variants of the random dictator system " he means systems of the form specified in the passage I have quoted , then Scheme 2 is a counterexample to this claim . 3 I owe this corollary to Hugo Sonnenschein .

BACKGROUND The notion of manipulability used in this paper is a variant of the one formulated by Dummett and Farquharson [ 2 ] . Manipulability and closely related matters are discussed by Arrow [ 1 , p . 7 ] , Vickrey [ 16 ] , Murakami [ 7 , pp . 74 - 81 ] , Farquharson [ 3 ] , Sen [ 15 , pp . 192 - 196 ] , and Pattanaik [ 9 , 10 , 11 , and 12 ] . The theorem cited at the outset of this paper is proved independently , in quite different ways , by Gibbard [ 6 ] and Satterthwaite [ 13 ] . A precise statement of the theorem is this : any scheme which uses rank order balloting in a nonchance way to select a single alternative is either manipulable , dictatorial ( in that someone is guaranteed his first choice from among the possible outcomes ) , or restricted to no more than two possible outcomes . This result holds both for schemes which allow individual indifference to be expressed and for schemes which do not . A streamlined proof of the theorem is given by Schmeidler and Sonnenschein [ 14 ] . This earlier theorem does not apply to systems of voting which allow tied outcomes . In my discussion of that theorem [ 6 , pp . 592 - 593 ] , I argued that it makes no sense to study the manipulability of schemes which allow ties unless one considers the system by which ties are to be broken . If ties are to be broken by chance , I argued , then the full system to be studied in effect yields outcomes which are lotteries among alternatives . It was Zeckhauser [ 17 ] who broached the study of voting with lotteries as alternatives . Fishburn [ 4 and 5 ] studies the subject further . A subsequent paper by Zeckhauser [ 18 ] is on virtually the topic of this paper . There Zeckhauser studies systems of voting which rely on individuals ' self - interested balloting and may have lotteries as outcomes . He concludes [ 18 , Theorem V , p . 945 ] that no such system can guarantee an outcome which is both ex ante Pareto optimal and , in a special sense , " nondictatorial " . ( For the case of two voters , an outcome is " dictatorial " in Zeckhauser ' s sense if it is the first choice of one voter and the last choice of the other ) . Zeckhauser ' s result is logically independent of the one in this paper . It is stronger in one respect : the results here are confined to systems with rank order balloting , whereas Zeckhauser ' s is not . Zeckhauser , on the other hand , requires that the lotteries that serve as outcomes of the schemes he considers be Pareto optimal ex ante , and , in his special sense , " nondictatorial " . The main theorem in this paper does not invoke Pareto optimality , and whereas the second corollary here is suggested by Zeckhauser ' s result , Zeckhauser ' s nondictatorship condition is much stronger than the nondictatorship condition in the corollary . Zeckhauser ' s result , then , neither directly entails the results in this paper nor is directly entailed by them . 3 . INDIVIDUAL INDIFFERENCE The main result in this paper fails when extended to systems that permit a voter to express indifference between alternatives . No doubt the easiest example of this failure is a serial dictatorship . Let a fixed " dictator " always get his first choice , and if more than one alternative ties as his first choice , let a " prime henchman " get his first choice from among the alternatives the dictator likes best . Let further ties be This content downloaded from 24 . 50 . 172 . 77 on Thu , 18 Jan 2018 02 : 53 : 46 UTC All use subject to http : / / about . jstor . org / terms SCHEMES THAT MIX VOTING WITH CHANCE 669 broken arbitrarily , say by selecting the tying alternative which is first on some predetermined list . Now a serial dictatorship is clearly strategy - proof : neither the dictator , the prime henchman , nor anyone else can ever gain by misrepresenting his preferences . If there are more than two alternatives , however , then the serial dictatorship is not equivalent to any probability mixture of unilateral or duple schemes , as the following considerations show . Note at the outset that a serial dictatorship is not unilateral . A scheme is unilateral , in the sense the term has been given here , only if it accords a single voter - call him the ruler - a monopoly of influence , so that no matter how anyone votes , the ballots of all voters other than the ruler are ignored . Under a serial dictatorship , the ballot of the prime henchman is not invariably ignored , and hence a serial dictatorship is not itself unilateral . Now a serial dictatorship is not a probability mixture which has any duple scheme as a part . If it were , then for at least one fixed pair of alternatives , the probability of the adopted alternative ' s being in that pair would have to be nonzero independently of how anyone voted . Under a serial dictatorship , both alternatives in any pair have probability zero of being adopted whenever neither is a first choice of the dictator . Thus if a serial dictatorship is a probability mixture of schemes each of which is unilateral or duple , then it is a probability mixture of unilateral schemes alone . The only unilateral schemes that could be part of this mixture , though , are ones for which the dictator is ruler . Otherwise , there would be a nonzero chance that no matter what the dictator ' s ballot said , it would be ignored , so that for some way the dictator and others might vote , an alternative which was not the first choice of the dictator would be adopted with nonzero probability . Under a serial dictatorship , on the other hand , the probability that the dictator will fail to get his first choice ( or one of his first choices in case he has no unique first choice ) is always zero . Thus if a serial dictatorship were a probability mixture of unilateral and duple schemes , it would have to consist of a single unilateral scheme with the dictator as ruler - and we have already seen that it does not . A serial dictatorship , then , is not a probability mixture of schemes which are unilateral or duple , and hence the theorem in this paper does not in general extend to systems which allow individuals to express indifference . What , then , can be said about systems with ballots which do allow individual indifference to be expressed ? What the theorem here tells us is this : if such a system s is strategy - proof , then there is a probability mixture m of unilateral and duple schemes which coincides with s whenever no one is indifferent between any pair of alternatives . For any ranking n - tuple P with no ties , in other words , m assigns the same prospect to P as does s . The force of the theorem , then , extends to systems which allow individuals to express indifference . For the force of the theorem lies in the judgment that any probability mixture of unilateral and duple schemes is grossly defective as a way of making community decisions . What the theorem says about systems with no individual indifference is , in effect , that nonmanipulability can be had only in systems which are otherwise grossly defective . Now take a system which is This content downloaded from 24 . 50 . 172 . 77 on Thu , 18 Jan 2018 02 : 53 : 46 UTC All use subject to http : / / about . jstor . org / terms 670 ALLAN GIBBARD nonmanipulable and allows individual indifference . For all cases in which no one is indifferent between alternatives , the system is a fixed mixture of unilateral and duple schemes . That in itself is a gross defect : for a significant class of combina - tions of individual preferences , the system stands ready to make the community choice in an unacceptable way . The theorem in this paper shows , then , that even in systems which permit a voter to express indifference , nonmanipulability may be had only at an exhorbitant price . 4 . DEFINITIONS AND PROOFS Let V be a finite set , called the set of alternatives . Variables w , x , y , and z will have V as their range of values . A strict ordering of V is a binary relation P which , for all x , y , and z , satisfies : Asymmetry : xPy - * - yPx . Negative transitivity : xPy - > ( xPz v zPy ) . Such a relation is transitive , and may allow indifference between alternatives . A ranking of V is a strict ordering of V which , for all x and y , satisfies : Connectedness : x ? y - > ( xPy v yPx ) . A ranking n - tuple over V is an n - tuple ( Pl , . . . , Pn ) of rankings of V . Ranking n - tuples will be represented by bold type on the pattern : P = ( Pl , . . . , PPn ) , P * = ( Pt , . . . , P * ) , and the like . P and P ' agree off k iff for all i # k , P ' = Pi . P / kP is the preference n - tuple P ' such that P ' = P and P ' agrees with P off k . We now define " proto - scheme " , " scheme " , and " decision scheme " . A measure over V is a function p which assigns a nonnegative real number , p ( x ) , to each member x of V . The sum : x p ( x ) of these numbers is called the weight of the measure . A lottery is a measure of weight one . A proto - scheme is a function d such that , for some positive integer n , called the number of voters of d , and for some finite set V , whose members are called alternatives of d , the domain of d is the set of all ranking n - tuples over V , and the values of d are measures over V . The value of d at P will be written dP , and the probability dP assigns to an alternative x will be written d ( x , P ) . A scheme is a proto - scheme all of whose values have the same weight ; this will be called the weight of the scheme . A decision scheme is a scheme of weight one . It thus assigns to each ranking n - tuple P a lottery over V . We consider , then , a fixed set V of alternatives and number n of voters . The variables will range as follows : w , x , y , and z are alternatives in V ; X , Y , and Z are sets of alternatives , i . e . , subsets of V ; P and Q are rankings of V ; P and Q are ranking n - tuples ( Pi , . . . , Pn ) over V ; i , j , and k are integers from 1 to n which stand for voters ; b , c , and d are schemes for n voters and set V of alternatives . Subscripts , superscripts , primes , and the like do not affect the range of variables . A utility scale U over V is an assignment of real numbers to the members of V . Where U is a utility scale over V and p is a lottery over V , we define the expected utility U ( p ) of p on scale U in this way : U ( p ) = Xx U ( x ) p ( x ) . Utility scale Ufits a strict ordering P iff for all x and y , U ( x ) > U ( y ) < - - xPy .

A decision scheme d is manipulable iff there are a voter k and a ranking n - tuple P such that d is potentially manipulable by k at P . Otherwise , d is strategy - proof . We now give a number of definitions which will allow the theorem on strategy - proof decision schemes to be stated in a preliminary , weak version . DEFINITION 1 : Scheme d is unilateral iff there is a k such that for all P and P ' , if P ' = Pk , then dP ' = dP . DEFINITION 2 : Scheme d is duple iff there are alternatives x and y such that for every other alternative z , d ( z , P ) = 0 for all P . DEFINITION 3 : Scheme d is a probability mixture of schemes d1 , . . . , dm iff there is a sequence a1 , . . . , am , with 0 < a , < 1 for each t Ell , - , m } and Y . m = l a , = 1 such that for each P and x , d ( x , P ) = a1d1 ( x , P ) + . . a + mdm ( x , P ) . Where d is such a probability mixture , we shall write d = ald1 + . . . + amdm , and where d = b + c , we shall write b = d - c . THEOREM ( weak version ) : If d is a strategy - proof decision scheme , then d is a probability mixture of decision schemes each of which is either unilateral or duple . This theorem can be strengthened to give conditions which are sufficient as well as necessary for a decision scheme ' s being strategy - proof . For any set X of alternatives and scheme d , we shall write d ( X , P ) for YZx , x d ( x , P ) , the total probability assigned by measure dP to members of X . X heads ranking Pk iff for any x eX and y X , xPky . DEFINITION 4 : Proto scheme d is localized iff for every k , P , P ' , and X such that X heads both Pk and P ' , d ( X , P / kP ' ) = d ( X , P ) . A switch is a reversal of two adjacent alternatives in a ranking . A scheme is nonperverse if switching an alternative upward never decreases its probability . DEFINITION 5 : XPk ! y means that XPky and - ( 3z ) ( xPkz and zPky ) . Where xPk ! y , P ' is the ranking which switches xy in Pk and permutes no other alternative , pkY = P / kPk , and EY ( d , P ) , the effect under d of k ' s switching y upward , is d ( y , pky ) - d ( y , P ) . Scheme d is nonperverse iff for every P , k , and y such that { y } does not head Pk , E Y ( d , P ) - 0 . THEOREM : A decision scheme d is strategy - proof if and only if it is a probability mixture of decision schemes , each of which is localized , non - perverse , and either unilateral or duple .

DEFINITION 6 : A proto - scheme d is pairwise responsive iff for every P , k , x , y , and z , if xPk ! y and zZ { x , y } , then d ( z , pkY ) = d ( z , P ) . LEMMA 1 : The following are equivalent : ( i ) d is a localized proto - scheme ; ( ii ) d is a pairwise responsive scheme ; ( iii ) d is a pairwise responsive proto - scheme , and for all x , y , P , and k such that xPk ! y , d ( { x , y } , pky ) = d ( { x , y } , P ) . PROOF . Suppose d is a localized proto - scheme . Then since V heads any P and P * , d ( V , P ) = d ( V , P ) , and d is a scheme . Now suppose thatxPk ! y , zj { x , y } , and W is the set of alternatives ranked above z in pk . Then both Wand Wu { z } head both Pk and Py . Thus since d is localized , k ' s switching y upward changes neither the total probability of W nor the total probability of Wu { z } . Thus it leaves the probability of z unchanged , and d is pairwise responsive . Thus ( i ) entails ( ii ) . For any pairwise responsive scheme , a switch of xy changes neither the total probabil - ity of V - { x , y } nor that of V ; thus it leaves that of { x , y } unchanged , and ( ii ) entails ( iii ) . Now suppose ( iii ) ; it follows that if xPk ! y and { x , y } c Z , then d ( Z , pky ) = d ( Z , P ) . If Z heads both Pk and P ' , then P ' can be formed from Pk by switches between members of Z and switches between nonmembers of Z , neither of which , we have seen , change the total probability of Z . Thus d is localized , and ( iii ) entails ( i ) . LEMMA 2 : A decision scheme d is strategy - proof iff d is localized and nonper - 4 verse . PROOF : Suppose that d is not localized , so that for some k , some P and P ' that agree off k , and some X which heads both Pk and Pk , d ( X , P ' ) - d ( X , P ) = > 0 . Let U fit Pk and be such that for all xeX , 1 U ( x ) < 1 + E , and for all yiX , 0 - U ( y ) < E . Then U ( dP ) < ( 1 + E ) d ( X , P ) + ? E [ l1 - d ( X , P ) ] = d ( X , P ) + ? E . U ( dP ' ) ? _ : 1 * d ( X , P ' ) + O * [ 1 - d ( X , Pt ) ] = d ( X , PI ) = d ( X , P ) + ? . Therefore U ( dP ' ) > U ( dP ) , and so d is potentially manipulable by k at P . If d is localized but perverse , then for some x , y , and k , XPk ! y and k ' s switching y upwards lowers the probability of y by some amount E > 0 . By ( iii ) of Lemma 1 , the switch raises the probability of x by E , and changes no other probabilities . Hence , if U fits Pk , so that U ( x ) > U ( y ) , then U ( dpkY ) - U ( dP ) = ? U ( x ) - ? U ( y ) > 0 , and so d is potentially manipulable by k at P . Now suppose d is localized and nonperverse , and consider any k , P , P ' , and U which fits Pk . Where P ' = P / kPk , we shall show that U ( dP ' ) - U ( dP ) . Form Pk from Pk by successive switches as follows : take the top alternative in P ' and switch 4Zeckhauser [ 18 , pp . 938 - 939 ] proves a similar result for systems that solicit individuals ' first place preferences only .

At each step , an alternative y is switched with an alternative which is above it in Pk . Since U fits Pk , U ( x ) > U ( y ) , and so by ( iii ) of Lemma 1 and the nonperversity of d , utility on scale U cannot be increased by such steps . Hence U ( dP ' ) - U ( dP ) . That proves the Lemma . DEFINITION 7 : Pi t { x , y } is Pi restricted to { x , y } , and P t { x , y } = ( P1 t { x , y } , . . . , Pn t { x , y } ) . A scheme d is pairwise isolated iff for any k , P , P * , x , and y , if xPk ! y , P * = Pk , and P * t { x , y } = P t { x , y } , then E Y ( d , P * ) = E Y ( d , P ) . d is decomposable iff for any fixed k , x , and y with x $ y , there are functions y and 8 such that for all P with xPk ! y , EY ( d , P ) = y ( Pt { x , Y } ) + 8 ( Pk ) DEFINITION 8 : Pkxy is Pk with x and y moved to the bottom , their ordering with respect to each other preserved , and the ordering of all other alternatives with respect to each other preserved . P , y is ( Pixy , . . . , Pnxy ) , Pkx is Pkxx , and Px is Pxx LEMMA 3 : Let scheme d be localized . Then d is pairwise isolated and decomposable . PROOF THAT d IS PAIRWISE ISOLATED : We first show that the switch of a pair by one person does not alter the effect of the switch of another pair by another person . Suppose j $ k , wPj ! z , xPk ! y , and { w , z } $ { x , y } . Case 1 ( y i { w , z } ) : d is pairwise responsive and PJZ differs from P only in j ' s switching wz ; thus d ( y , PiZ ) = d ( y , P ) . Likewise , pjzky differs from pky only in j ' s switching wz ; thus d ( y , pizky ) = d ( y , pky ) . Hence , d ( y , pjzky ) - d ( y , PJZ ) = d ( y , pky ) - d ( y , P ) , which is to say ? k ( d , Piz ) = ? ( d , P ) . Case 2 ( xi { w , z } ) : By an argument like that in Case 1 , ? x ( d , pjzky ) = x ( d , pkY ) . It follows from this and ( iii ) of Lemma 1 that ? ( d , PIZ ) = Y ( d , P ) . Now let XPk ! y , P * = Pk , and P * t { x , y } = P t { x , y } . Then P * can be formed from P by a sequence of switches by voters other than k , none of which switches x with y . We have just seen that none of these changes the value of 4 , and thus ? ( d , P * ) = k ( d , P ) . Thus d is pairwise isolated . PROOF THAT d IS DECOMPOSABLE : Take k , x , and y with x $ y . For any P with XPk ! y , define y ( P t { x , y } ) = EY ( d , Pkxy ) . Now let P and P * be such that XPk ! y and P * = Pk ; we shall show ( 1 ) ? Y ( d , P * ) - y ( P * 1T { X , y } = ? Y ( d , P ) - y ( Pt { x , y } ) . Since d is pairwise isolated , Y ( d , P ) depends only on Pk and P t { x , y } ; thus we may suppose without loss of generality that ' teryone other than k ranks x and y last . Now form pk from Pk by the following sequence of switches .

( b ) Progressively switch x down to just above y . ( c ) Switch y with x . ( d ) Progressively switch y up to its original position . ( e ) Progressively switch x up to just below y . Call this sequence P ? k , . . . , Pk , and consider the difference ( 2 ) d ( y , P / kP ) - d ( y , P / kPk ) as t goes from 0 to , u . This difference changes only in step ( c ) . For the steps in ( a ) and ( d ) consist of switching y with various alternatives z i { x , y } . Everyone except k ranks z above y in both P and P * , and so since d is pairwise isolated , both terms of ( 2 ) change by the same amount , and ( 2 ) is unchanged . The steps in ( b ) and ( e ) consist of switching x with alternatives other than y ; since d is pairwise respon - sive , this changes neither term of ( 2 ) . Now at step ( c ) , x and y are switched in Pkxy . The change in ( 2 ) at step ( c ) , then , is ( 3 ) ? y ( d , P , Y ) - ? E ( d , Pxy ) This , then , is the change in ( 2 ) from t = 0 to t = g , u that is , [ d ( y , pky ) - d ( y , p * ky ) ] - [ d ( y , P ) - d ( y , P * ) ] , which is E Y ( d , P ) - E Y ( d , P * ) . From the equality of this with ( 3 ) , ( 1 ) follows . Since the quantity in ( 1 ) depends only on Pk , let 8 ( Pk ) be this quantity ; then 4Y ( d , P ) = y ( P t { x , y } ) + 8 ( Pk ) , and d is decomposable . DEFINITION 9 : k ' s unilateral component of decision scheme d is the function dk such that for all x and P , dk ( x , P ) = minQ { d ( x , Q / kPk ) - d ( x , Q / kPkX ) } X Since the value of dk ( x , P ) depends only on x and Pk , this will be written dk ( x , Pk ) . LEMMA 4 : Let d be a strategy - proof decision scheme , and let dk be k ' s unilateral component of d . Then ( i ) if xPk ! y , then ? k ( dk , P ) = minQ E Y ( d , Q / kPk ) . ( ii ) dk is a scheme which is unilateral , localized , and nonperverse . PROOF OF ( i ) : Let xPk ! y , let a = dk ( y , Pk ) , and let 8 = dk ( y , PY ) . Then 4 ( dk , P ) = - a . Let E = minQ Y4 ( d , Q / kPk ) ; we are to prove that ? = - a . By the definition of , 3 , for some Q , j6 = d ( y , Q / kPk ) - d ( y , Q / kPky ) and by the definitions of a and E , a d ( y , Q / kPk ) - d ( y , Q / kPkx ) ; ? E d ( y , Q / kPk ) - d ( y , Q / kPk ) .

We will have a + E ? , 8 if there is a Q such that ( 4 ) d ( y , Q / kPk ) - d ( y , Q / kPky ) = a + E , since , 8 is the minimal value of this difference . Construct such a Q as follows . By the definition of a , for some P * with P * = Pk , a = d ( y , P * ) - d ( y , P * / kPky ) . This difference is the sum of the effects , in context P * , of k ' s successively switching y from bottom to just below x in Pk . Since d is pairwise isolated and y is not switched with x , each of these effects is independent of where others besides k place x in their rankings . On the other hand , since d is pairwise isolated , the effect under d of k ' s switching y with x is independent of the way others vote except for their ranking of x with respect to y . By the definition of E , for some F ' , Pk = Pk and Y = ( d , P ' ) . Form Q from P * by moving x , in the ranking of each voter i $ k , to just above y in P * or just below y in P * according as xP ' y or yP ' x . Then , we have seen , a = d ( y , Q ) - d ( y , Q / kPky ) , ? = 4 ? kY ( d , Q ) = d ( y , Q / kPy - d ( y , Q ) , and hence by addition , ( 4 ) holds . PROOF OF ( ii ) : Since d is nonperverse , d ( x , Q / kPk ) - d ( x , Q / kPkx ) ; 0 for all Q . Hence its minimal value dk ( x , Pk ) is nonnegative , and dk is a proto - scheme . Now let XPk ! y . By ( i ) , dk ( x , Pk ) - dk ( x , PY ) = minQF x ( d , Q / kPk ) ; dk ( y , PY ) - dk ( Y , Pk ) = minQF Y ( d , Q / kPk ) By ( iii ) of Lemma 1 , these two minima must be equal , and hence d , ( { x , y } , Pk ) = dk ( { x , y } , Pk ) . Now let zi { x , y } , and take any Q . Since d is pairwise responsive , d ( z , Q / kPky ) = d ( z , Q / kPk ) . By ( iii ) of Lemma 1 , d ( z , Q / kPykz ) = d ( z , Q / kPkz ) . Therefore , d ( z , Q / kPk ) - d ( z , Q / kPkz ) = d ( z , Q / kPk ) - d ( z , Q / k Pkz ) , and so the minima are equal : dk ( z , Pk ) = dk ( z , Pk ) . Thus ( iii ) in Lemma 1 is satisfied for dk , and so dk is a localized scheme . Finally , by ( i ) , if xPk ! y , then for some Q , 4Y ( dk , Pk ) = 4Y ( d , Q ) , and since d is nonperverse , this is nonnegative ; therefore dk is nonperverse . dk is clearly unilateral , and the lemma is proved . DEFINITION 10 : A scheme d ignores external comparisons iff for any x , y , k , P , and P * , if xPk , ! y and P * t { x , y } = P t { x , y } , then EY4 ( d , P * ) = 4 ( d , P ) . LEMMA 5 : Suppose d is a strategy - proof decision scheme . For each k , let dk be k ' s unilateral component of d , and define functions do , c , and cyz for each { y , z } such This content downloaded from 24 . 50 . 172 . 77 on Thu , 18 Jan 2018 02 : 53 : 46 UTC All use subject to http : / / about . jstor . org / terms 676 ALLAN GIBBARD that y ? z as follows . do ( x , P ) = d ( x , PJ ) ; c ( x , P ) = d ( x , P ) - do ( x , P ) - . * dn , ( x P ) ; cyz ( x , P ) = c ( x , Pyz ) for xe { y , z } and 0 for xL { y , z } . Then c ignores external comparisons . Each function do . . . . , dn , c , and each c , y is a localized , nonperverse scheme , do , . . . , dn are unilateral , each c . , is duple , and for all x and P , ( 5 ) d ( x , P ) = do ( x , P ) + Zkdk ( x , P ) + Z cyz ( x , P ) , where Xyz sums over all pairs { y , z } with y ? z . PROOF : do is constant for each x , and thus , like each dk , a unilateral , localized , nonperverse scheme . Now consider c , and let XPk ! y . 4k ( di , P ) = 0 for i ? k , and thus sy ( c , P ) = Ey ( d , P ) - Ey ( dk , P ) . By Lemma 4 ( i ) , Y ( dk , P ) % ? Y ( d , P ) ; hence , ? Y ( c , P ) : 0 and c is nonperverse . Since do ( x , P ) = d ( x , PF ) and di ( x , PF ) = 0 for i # 0 , c ( x , PF ) = 0 for all x and P . Thus since c is nonperverse , c ( x , P ) ? 0 for all x and P , and c is a proto - scheme . Since d , do , . . . , dn are all localized , c is localized and , hence , a scheme . The function c ignores external comparisons . For , let XPk ! y . Since d is decom - posable , there are functions y and 8 such that for any Q with xQk ! y , syj ( d , Q ) = y ( Q t { x , y } ) + 6 ( Qk ) . Thus 8Y ( d , P ) = y ( P Tj { x , y } ) + 6 ( Pk ) . Let Q minimize 4y ( d , Q ) for Qk = Pk ; then by Lemma 4 ( i ) , 8Y ( dk , P ) = 4 ( d , Q ) = y ( Q t { x , y } ) + 8 ( Pk ) . Therefore E ( c , P ) = y ( P t { x , y } ) - y ( Q t { x , y } ) . Now let P * t { x , y } = P Tj { x , y } ; by a like argument , where Q * minimizes 4Y ( d , Q * ) for Q * = Pk , sy ( c p * ) = y ( P * T { x , y } ) - y ( Q * T { x , y } ) . Since Q minimizes 4Y ( d , Q ) = y ( Q { x , y } ) + 8 ( Pk ) for Qk = Pk , Q minimizes y ( Q { x , y } ) for xQky , and since xP * y , Q * = Q / kPk minimizes y ( Q * T { x , y } ) for Qk * - Pk . For this Q * , Q * t { x , Y } = QI { x , y } , and so 4k ( c , P * ) = Y ( F * I { x Y } ) - Y ( Q * T { x , y } ) y ( P 1 { x , y } ) - y ( Q 1 { x , y } ) = 4 ( c , P ) . Thus c ignores external comparisons . Since c ( z , P ) 0 for all z and P , from the way c . y is defined , c ' y ( z , P ) 0 . Moreover , cY ( V , P ) = c ( { x , y } , P , y ) and since c is localized , this is constant for all P , and cy is a scheme . cry is pairwise responsive and , hence , localized : an xy switch leaves all other probabilities zero , and any other switch leaves all prob - abilities unchanged . c . is nonperverse : if wPk ! z and { w , z } # { x , y } , ? ( c P ) = 0 , and if XPk ! y , ? Y ( cxy , P ) = eY ( c , F . y ) : 0 , since c is nonperverse .

We noted earlier that c ( x , PF ) = 0 for all x and P ; thus cyz ( x , PF ) = 0 . For if x { y , z } , then cyz ( x , P ) = 0 for all P , and cyz ( y , Py ) = c ( y , ( Py ) yz ) = 0 , since ( Py ) yz has y uniformly on the bottom . There - fore , c ( x , PF ) = 0 = yzCyz ( x , Px ) . Now form P from PF by successively shifting x upward in each ranking ; call the resulting sequence Po , . . . , PF . At each step from Pt to P + some k switches x with a w such that wP Ix . Now cw . ( x , F + l > cwx ( x , Pt ) = c ( x , PF + 1 ) - c ( x , PFX ) = Ex ( c , PFX ) = = E ( c , Pt ) since c ignores external comparisons ; thus c ( x , PF + ? ) - c ( x , PF ) = cwx ( x , pt + 1 ) - cWX ( x , Pt ) . For { y , z } A { x , w } , PI kyz - = Pk , and so cyz ( x , P ' + ' ) = cyz ( x , Ft ) . Therefore , c ( x , p ? + l ) - c ( x , PF ) = yzcyz ( X , + l ) - yzcyz ( x , FPt ) . Since c ( x , PF ) = yzcyz ( x , PO ) , by induction c ( x , P ) = yzcyz ( X , PL ) for all PF , and thus c ( x , P ) = ; yzcyz ( x , P ) . Equation ( 5 ) follows immediately . PROOF OF THEOREM : In ( 5 ) , drop schemes of weight zero , so that d is a sum b * + . . . + b * of schemes of positive weight 1 , . . . , am , respectively . Let each decision scheme b , = ( 1 / aj ) b ; then d = ab1 + . b . . + ambm , and each bL is localized , nonperverse , and either unilateral or duple . Conversely , if decision scheme d is a probability mixture of this kind , then d is clearly localized and nonperverse ; hence , by Lemma 2 , d is strategy - proof . That completes the proof of the theorem . 5 . COROLLARIES DEFINITION 11 : k is dictator for decision scheme d iff for every P , x and y , if XPky then d ( y , P ) = 0 . d is dictatorial iff there is a dictator for d . DEFINITION 12 : Lottery p is Pareto optimal ex post for ranking n - tuple P iff for any x , if there is a y such that yPix for all i , then p ( x ) = 0 . Decision scheme d is Pareto optimific ex post iff for every P , lottery dPis Pareto optimal ex post for P . COROLLARY 1 ( Sonnenschein ) : Let decision scheme d be strategy - proof and Pareto optimific ex post . Let the set V of alternatives for d have at least three members . Then d is a probability mixture of dictatorial decision schemes . PROOF : Since d is strategy - proof , d is a probability mixture of decision schemes , each of which is unilateral or duple . Let d = aid , + . . . + amdm , where for each t E { 1 , . . . , m } , a , > 0 and de is nonnull and either unilateral or duple . Then no d , is duple . For since d is Pareto optimific ex post , the alternatives in any pair { x , y } get a probability of zero whenever some alternative z is unanimously preferred to them . Thus for any pair { x , y } , d , ( { x , y } , P ) = 0 whenever zP , x and zPiy for each i ; therefore d , is not an xy duple scheme . Hence , each de is unilateral .

Then , we shall show , d , ( y , P ) = 0 . For let P ' be such that P ' k = Pk and for all i , xPiy . Then since d is Pareto optimific ex post , d ( y , P ' ) = 0 , and thus d , ( y , P ' ) = 0 . Since d , is unilateral on the part of k and P ' k = Pk , d , ( y , P ) = 0 . We have shown that for any P , x , and y , if XPky then d , ( y , P ) = 0 . Thus k is dictator for d , . We have shown that each d , is dictatorial , and the corollary is proved . DEFINITION 13 : Lottery p is Pareto optimal ex ante for utility scales U1 , . . . , Un iff there is no lottery p ' such that for each i , Ui ( p ' ) > Ui ( p ) . Decision scheme d is Pareto optimific ex ante iff for every ranking n - tuple P and every n - tuple ( U1 , . . . , Un ) of utility scales such that for each i , Pi fits Ui , lottery dP is Pareto optimal ex ante for U1 , . . . , Un . COROLLARY 2 : Let decision scheme d be strategy - proof and Pareto optimific ex ante . Let the set V of alternatives for d have at least three members . Then d is dictatorial . Proof : Note first that if d is Pareto optimific ex ante , then d is Pareto optimific ex post . For , let preference rankings P1 , . . . , Pn fit U1 , . . . . , Um , respectively , and suppose lottery p is not Pareto optimal ex post for P1 , . . . , Pn . Then for some pair of alternatives x and y , yPix for all i , but p ( x ) $ 0 . Now let p ' give x ' s probability to y , so that p ' ( x ) = 0 , p ' ( y ) = p ( x ) + p ( y ) , and p ' ( z ) = p ( z ) for all z E { x , y } . Then for each i , since Pi fits Ui , Ui ( y ) > Ui ( x ) , and so Ui ( p ' ) > Ui ( p ) . Therefore p is not Pareto optimal ex ante for U1 , . . . , Un , and d is not Pareto optimific ex ante . Suppose now that d is Pareto optimific ex ante , and therefore Pareto optimific ex post . Then d is a probability mixture of dictatorial decision schemes . Let d = ald ? + . . . + andn , where for each i , ai - 0 and i is dictator for di . Suppose that d is not itself dictatorial , so that ai > 0 for more than one i . Let axk > 0 , let x , y , and z be distinct alternatives , and let the utility scales U1 , . . . , Un be as follows . Uk ( x ) = 1 , 1 > Uk ( y ) > ak , Uk ( Z ) = 0 , and for all wi { x , y , z } , Uk ( w ) < 0 . For all i $ k , Ui ( z ) = 1 , 1 > U1 ( y ) > 1 - ak , Ui ( x ) = 0 , and for all wi { x , y , z } , Ui ( w ) < 0 . For each i , let Pi fit Ui , so that { x } heads Pk and { z } heads Pi for all i $ k . Then d ( x , P ) = ak , d ( z , P ) = 1 - ak , and d ( w , P ) = 0 for all w distinct from x and y . Therefore Uk ( dP ) = ak , and for i ? k , Ui ( d , P ) = 1 - ak . Now let 9 be the lottery that gives y as a sure thing . Then Uk ( 9 ) > ak and for i $ # k , U1 ( 9 ) > 1 - xak . Therefore for all i , iJ ( 9 ) > Ui ( dP ) , and so dP is not Pareto optimal ex ante for U1 , . . . , Un .

Therefore d is dictatorial , and the corollary is proved . 5 Corollary 2 can be extended to schemes that allow individual indifference . Let a preference n - tuple over Vbe an n - tuple of strict orderings of V . Let an unrestricted decision scheme ( UDS ) be a function which , for some finite set V of alternatives and number n , takes as arguments all preference n - tuples over V , and takes as values lotteries over V . Manipulability is defined as before , with the term " ranking " replaced by " strict ordering " . The following Lemma allows us both to extend Corollary 2 to UDS ' s , and to derive the old theorem on non - chance voting schemes . Where d is a decision scheme or UDS , a possible outcome for d is an alternative x such that for some P in the domain of d , d ( x , P ) > 0 . A weak dictator for d is a voter k such that for every P , where X is the set of possible outcomes which are first among possible outcomes in Pk , d ( X , P ) = 1 . d is weakly dictatorial iff there is a weak dictator for d . LEMMA 6 : Letd be a strategy - proof UDS , and letd ' be the decision scheme which is d with its domain restricted to ranking n - tuples . Then ( i ) any possible outcome of d is a possible outcome of d ' , and ( ii ) a weak dictator for d ' is weak dictator for d . PROOF OF ( i ) : Suppose x is a possible outcome of d but not of d ' . Let P be a ranking n - tuple such that x ranks first in every Pi , and let P * be a preference n - tuple such that d ( x , P * ) > O . Form a sequence of preference n - tuples pO . . . Xpn as follows : let Po = P , and for each i , let P = Pil / IPi * , so that pn p * . Then since Po is a ranking n - tuple and x is not a possible outcome of d ' , we have that d ( x , PF ) = 0 , whereas d ( x , pn ) > 0 . Take the least j such that d ( x , Fi ) > O , and let d ( x , Pi ) = e . Then d ( x , PI - ) = O , and P ' - j P , . Since P1 ranks x first , there is a utility scale U which fits Pj , such that U ( x ) = 1 and for all y ? x , 0 S U ( y ) < E . Since d ( x , Pi ) = E , U ( x ) = 1 , and for all y ? x , U ( y ) 3 0 , we have that U ( dPi ) - E . Since d ( x , PF - ' ) = 0 and for all y ? x , U ( y ) < E , we have that U ( dP - ' ) < E . Thus U ( dP ' ) > U ( dP ' - 1 ) , and since U fits Pj and Pj1 = Pj , d is potentially manipulable by j at P ' - 1 . PROOF OF ( ii ) : From ( i ) , the possible outcomes of d and d ' are the same . Now suppose k is weak dictator for d ' but not for d . Then for some preference n - tuple P , where Xis the set of possible outcomes ranked first in Pk , d ( X , P ) ? 1 . For some x E X , let P * rank x first , and for every i $ k , let P * rank x last . Let P0 = P / kPk * . Then d ( x , PO ) ? 1 , for otherwise , on any utility scale U which fits Pk , we would have that U ( dP ? ) = U ( x ) and U ( dP ) < U ( x ) , so that U ( dP ? ) > U ( dP ) . Thus d would be potentially manipulable by k at P . Now form sequence po , . . . , pn by letting Pi = Pil / P * for each i , so that PF = P * . Then since P " is a ranking n - tuple with k , who is weak dictator for d ' , ranking possible outcome x first , we have that d ( x , pn ) = 1 . Take the least j such that d ( x , Pi ) = 1 ; then d ( x , Pi1 ) < 1 . We know that j ? k , since from the way Pi is defined , pk = pk - l . Therefore x is at S Aspects of this proof are suggested by arguments in Zeckhauser [ 18 ] .

Thus U ( dP 1 ) > U ( dP ' ) , and since P = P * and U fits P * , d is potentially manipulable by j at Pi . That proves the lemma . COROLLARY 2 ' : Let UDS d be strategy - proof and Pareto optimific ex ante , and let d cover at least three alternatives . Then d is dictatorial . PROOF : Since d is Pareto optimific ex ante , all alternatives are possible outcomes , and so a weak dictator is dictator . By Corollary 2 , d with its domain restricted to ranking n - tuples is dictatorial , and thus by Lemma 6 , d is dictatorial . DEFINITION 14 : A voting scheme is a UDS v such that for every x and preference n - tuple P , either v ( x , P ) = 1 or v ( x , P ) = 0 . COROLLARY 3 : If a voting scheme is strategy - proof , then it is either duple or weakly dictatorial . PROOF : Let voting scheme v be strategy - proof , and let v ' be v with its domain restricted to ranking n - tuples . Then by the Theorem , v ' is a probability mixture a Id , + . . . + amdm , where each a , is positive , la , = 1 , and each d , is unilateral or duple . Now if v ' ( x , P ) = 1 , then for each L , dL ( x , P ) = 1 , and if v ' ( x , P ) = 0 , then for each L , d , ( x , P ) = 0 . Hence , each d , is identical with v ' , and v ' is either unilateral or duple . If v ' is duple - that is , has at most two possible outcomes - then by ( i ) of Lemma 6 , v is duple . Let v ' be unilateral , with k as ruler . Then v ' is weakly dictatorial . For let x be a possible outcome . Then for some ranking n - tuple P * , v ' ( x , P * ) > 0 , and , hence , v ' ( x , P * ) = 1 . Thus since v ' is unilateral , v ' ( x , P ) = 1 wherever Pk = Pk . Suppose , then , that v ' is not weakly dictatorial , so that for some alternative x and ranking n - tuple P , x is first in P . but v ' ( x , P ' ) # 1 . Where P = P ' / kPk , we know that v ' ( x , P ) = 1 . Thus for any utility scale U which fits P ' , U ( vP ) > U ( vP ' ) , and v ' is potentially manipulable by k at P . The supposition that v ' is not weakly dictatorial has been shown false . It follows from ( ii ) of Lemma 6 that v itself is weakly dictatorial . That proves the corollary .
