However , the relation between Cx43 and angiogenic activity of the EPC remained unclear . In the study , human late EPC were treated with siRNA speciﬁc to Cx43 ( Cx43siRNA ) . The expression proﬁles as well as activity of the treated cells were examined . In parallel , the angiogenic potential of human EPC treated with Cx43siRNA was evaluated using murine hind limb ischemic model . The results showed that , in the EPC treated with Cx43siRNA , the activity of migration , proliferation , and angiogenic potential were attenuated , accompanied by reduction in vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) expression . In hind limb ischemia mice , EPC treated with Cx43siRNA lost the therapeutic angiogenic potential . VEGF supple - mentation partially recovered the activity impaired by Cx43 down - regulation . In conclusion , reduced Cx43 expression per se in the EPC causes decreased expression of VEGF and impaired angiogenic potential of the cells . Prevention of Cx43 reduction is a potential target to maintain the angiogenic potential of the EPC . Keywords Angiogenesis (cid:2) Connexin43 (cid:2) Connexins (cid:2) Endothelial progenitor cell Introduction Endothelial cells line the innermost layer of vascular wall and play a key role in maintenance of vascular homeosta - sis . Once endothelial cells were injured and detached from the vascular wall , the defect requires repair mechanisms to cover , through enlargement or proliferation of the adjacent endothelial cells , as well as transformation of circulating endothelial progenitor cells ( EPC ) [ 1 ] . EPC circulating in peripheral blood mainly come from bone marrow . Previous in vitro studies had shown that circulating EPC was able to differentiate into endothelial cells [ 2 ] , and in vivo studies also showed that EPC contributed to neoangiogenesis after tissue ischemia [ 2 , 3 ] . Meanwhile multiple studies have conﬁrmed the pivotal role of EPC in tissue angiogenesis [ 4 ] . Currently , the phenotype of EPC is found divergent and different cell populations are termed EPC .

Accumulated preclinical and clinical data suggested that introduction of exogenous vascular progenitor cells promoted vascularization and improved organ function through paracrine effect [ 6 ] . Vascular injury , including limb ischemia and myocardial infarct , releases signals into the circulation such as VEGF and stromal cell - derived factor - 1 ( SDF - 1 ) that promote the mobilization of EPC from bone marrow into the circula - tion . Moreover , local concentrations of VEGF and SDF - 1 are elevated in ischemic foci and contribute to EPC recruitment from the circulation to the site of injury [ 7 , 8 ] . Our previous work had demonstrated that endothelial Cx43 gap junctions were down - regulated by a variety of factors causing endothelial dysfunction , including arsenic compound , which is a main contributor to the pathogenesis of blackfoot disease , an accelerated form of atherosclerosis [ 9 ] . Arsenic had proatherogenic effect attributable to impaired angiogenesis and vascular toxicity , which con - tribute to endothelial dysfunction [ 10 – 12 ] . Since a major role of circulating EPC is responsible for the repair of vascular wall after injury by transformation into endothe - lial cells , we suspected that Cx43 in the transformed EPC may also be reduced by arsenic compound and the results showed that arsenic trioxide down - regulated Cx43 as well as attenuated the angiogenic potential of the cells ( Sup - plementary Figure 1 ) . Such ﬁndings suggested that Cx43 may be involved in angiogenic activity of the EPC . To clarify the relation between Cx43 and angiogenic activity , in this study , we knocked down the expression of Cx43 using siRNA speciﬁc to Cx43 and exanibed the patho - physiological implication of Cx43 per se in human late EPC , a type of cells morphologically and immuno cyto - logically very much similar to endothelial cells [ 13 ] . Materials and methods Isolation of human CD34 - positive endothelial progenitor cells This investigation conforms with the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki for use of human tissue . Ethical approval was granted by the Institutional Review Board of the Mackay Memorial Hospital , Taipei , Taiwan ( reference number : MMH - I - S - 168 ) . Informed consent was obtained from healthy donors before the collection of peripheral blood ( 80 mL ) . The peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) were fractionated from other blood components by centrifugation on Ficoll - Paque TM plus ( GE Healthcare , Uppsala , Sweden ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . CD34 - positive progenitor cells were obtained and cultured as previously described [ 14 ] . In brief , the cells were isolated from PBMCs using CD34 MicroBead kit and MACS TM Cell Separation System ( all from Miltenyi Bio - tec , Bergisch Gladbach , Germany ) . CD34 - positive EPC were maintained in MV2 complete medium ( PromoCell , Heidelberg , Germany ) consisting of endothelial basal medium , 20 % fetal bovine serum , hEGF , VEGF , hFGF - B , IGF - 1 , ascorbic acid , and heparin . 1 9 10 6 cells / cm 2 were seeded on ﬁbronectin - coated dish ( BD Biosciences , San Jose , CA , USA ) and maintained in 37 (cid:3) C incubator under a humidiﬁed 95 % air and 5 % CO 2 atmosphere . Charac - terization of EPC were described in supplementary data ( see supplementary Figure 2 ) . Under daily observation , ﬁrst medium change was performed 3 days after plating . Thereafter , media was changed every 3 days . Cell culture and siRNA transfection Human endothelial cells , including aortic endothelial cells ( HAEC ) , umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVEC ) , microvascular endothelial cells ( MVEC ) , and the isolated EPC were maintained in medium MV and MV2 with growth supplement , respectively ( named complete medium ; all from PromoCell , Heidelberg , Germany ) . The cultures were seeded onto 1 % gelatin - coated plastic ware or 2 % gelatin - coated glass coverslips and maintained in 37 (cid:3) C incubator under a humidiﬁed 95 % air and 5 % CO 2 atmosphere . Connexin - speciﬁc siRNAs , including Cx37 , Cx40 , and Cx43 ( listed in supplementary Table 1 ) , were transfected into endothelial cells using complete culture medium and serum free medium in the absence or presence of cationic lipid reagent ( LipofectAMINE 2000 , Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) . After 5 . 5 h of treatment , medium containing siRNA were replaced with fresh culture medium , according to the experimental protocols . Cells were applied to real - time polymerase chain reaction , Western blotting , angiogenic potential , migration , and proliferation analysis , as described in Supplementary Materials and Methods . For ﬂuorescence quantiﬁcation , labeled siRNAs were examined with FACS Calibur TM ﬂowcytometer and analyzed using CellQuest TM software ( all from BD Biosciences ) . Transfection efﬁciency of EPC was shown in supplementary Figure 3 . Analysis of in vitro angiogenic potential After the transfection of siRNA and 18 . 5 h of recovery , the cells were trypsinized and resuspended with medium MV containing 0 . 5 % FBS . Cells were counted by trypan blue staining and diluted to a density of 3 9 10 4 cells / mL . One mL of the cell suspension was plated onto 24 - well plate containing 200 l l solidiﬁed Matrigel ( growth factor reduced , from Becton – Dickinson , Franklin Lakes , NJ , USA ) per well . Images showed that the polygonal structure was formed after 24 h of inoculation ( supplementary Fig - ure 4 ) . The images were acquired at 24 h and the tube 554 Angiogenesis ( 2013 ) 16 : 553 – 560 123 length and branch point were measured using QWIN image analysis software ( Leica ) as previously described [ 15 ] . For each type of treatment , the cumulative tube length in ﬁve randomly selected microscopic ﬁelds ( 40 9 ) derived from 3 independent experiments was calculated . In vivo angiogenesis model This animal investigation conforms with the policies in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the US National Institutes of Health ( Publication No . 85 - 23 , revised 1996 ) . The animal - use protocol had been reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee in the Mackay Memorial Hospital , Taipei , Taiwan ( reference number : MMH - A - S - 98022 ) . To create the hind limb ischemia model , 8 - week BALB / c female athymic nude mice , weighing 18 – 22 g , were used . As pre - viously described , the right femoral artery and vein were ligated and cut , from just above the deep femoral artery to the popliteal artery and vein [ 14 ] . Twenty four hours after operation , 2 9 10 5 human EPC in 50 l L saline were injec - ted into the hind limb intramuscularly . Animals were sacri - ﬁced by intraperitoneal injection of overdose pentobarbital ( 160 mg / kg ) and calf muscles were dissected and prepared for immunoﬂuorescence microscopy and histology exami - nation at indicated time points . Laser doppler perfusion imaging ( LDPI ) Detection of hind limb subcutaneous blood ﬂow was per - formed using a Laser Doppler Imager ( Moor Instruments , Milwey , UK ) . Mice were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital ( 50 mg / kg ) and placed on a heater at 37 (cid:3) C before scanning . The region of interest included the thigh , leg , and foot . Perfusion analyses were performed sequentially at 24 h after surgery ( just before Fig . 1 mRNA and protein expression proﬁle of Cx37 , Cx40 , and Cx43 in endothelial cells of various origins , as examined using real - time PCR ( a ) and Western blotting ( b ) followed by analysis ( c – e ) . See text for details . Note that comparisons were conducted between EPC and each of the other 3 types of cells , as well as between low and high passage number cells of the same type . Cx43 mRNA level in the low passage number group was set as 100 % . Cells with passage number B 4 and C 8 were annotated as low and high , respectively . * P \ 0 . 05 ; * * P \ 0 . 01 , compared to low passage group in each connexin . # P \ 0 . 05 , compared to HAEC and HUVEC Angiogenesis ( 2013 ) 16 : 553 – 560 555 123 the injection of EPC ) and at 7 , 14 , and 21 days after the injection . The calculated perfusion was expressed as a ratio of left ( ischemic ) to right ( normal ) hind limb . Statistical analysis All values are presented as the mean ± SD . A one - way analysis of variance followed by post hoc test was used to examine differences between three or more groups ; the unpaired Student’s t test was used to evaluate differences between two groups . P value of less than 0 . 05 was con - sidered to indicate statistical signiﬁcance . Results Expression proﬁles of connexins in EPC Real - time PCR showed that Cx37 , Cx40 , and Cx43 tran - scripts existed in human EPC , and Cx43 is the predominant isoform . Compared to the Cx43 mRNA level in the low passage number group , expression of Cx37 and Cx40 is about 11 and 2 % , respectively . ( Figure 1a ) . In addition , the transcript expression level for each connexins was similar between the low ( passage B 4 ) and high passage cells ( passage C 8 ) . Western blots conﬁrmed the presence of Cx37 , Cx40 , and Cx43 proteins in the EPC ( Fig . 1b ) . To understand if EPC had distinct connexins expression pro - ﬁles and if the proﬁles were passage - dependent , the relative protein expression levels of connexins in endothelial cells of different origins as well as different passages were compared . For Cx43 protein , in the low passage cells , the expression levels were similar among HAEC , HUVEC , MVEC , and EPC ( Fig . 1c ) . In addition , in the high passage EPC , the expression levels increased , compared to the low passage cells ( Fig . 1c ) . For Cx37 protein , the expression level in the EPC was similar to those of the other three types of cells ( Fig . 1d ) . The expression level was also similar between the low and high passage EPC ( Fig . 1d ) . For Cx40 protein , in contrast to Cx43 and Cx37 proteins , the expression level in the EPC , regardless of low or high passage number , was much less , compared to the other 3 types of cells ( Fig . 1e ) . Since Cx43 is the predominant isoform in EPC , the following experiments of EPC focused on Cx43 . To explore the biological effects of reduced expression of Cx43 in the EPC , the cells were treated with Cx43 - speciﬁc siRNA and examined as illustrated ( Fig . 2a ) . The results showed that the expression level of Cx43 was Fig . 2 Protein proﬁle of connexins in endothelial cells transfected with Cx43 - speciﬁc siRNA , as examined using Western blotting ( b and c ) . a Schematic diagram shows the approach and time table of in vitro analysis . Note that the down - regulating effect of Cx43 - speciﬁc siRNA in EPC is similar to that in HAEC . Also note that Cx43 - speciﬁc siRNA has minimal effect on the level of Cx37 and Cx40 in both HAEC and EPC . In each bar chart , the connexin level of the control bar of HAEC was used as a reference .

In addition , the levels of Cx37 and Cx40 were minimally changed in the treated cells ( Fig . 2 b , c ) . Flowcytometry showed that in the EPC treated with 25 nM AF555 - labeled siRNA the transfection efﬁciency was about 93 % ( sup - plementary Figure 3 ) . Gap junctions in EPC are mainly made of Cx43 The function of gap - junction communication was checked using the method of scrape - loading / dye transfer . The results showed that the EPC treated with Cx43siRNA exhibited signiﬁcantly attenuated gap - junction communi - cation , while the communication in EPC treated with Cx37siRNA or Cx40siRNA was minimally changed ( Fig . 3 ) . The silencing potency of siRNAs speciﬁc to Cx37 , Cx40 , and Cx43 was veriﬁed by real - time PCR ( supple - mentary Figure 5 ) . Real - time PCR and Western blotting were used to validate the duration of Cx43 - speciﬁc siRNA . Results showed that the Cx43 protein expression was down - regulated for more than 56 % up to 192 h ( supple - mentary Figure 6 ) . Cx43 silencing attenuates the cellular function of EPC in vitro Real - time PCR probing seven other key molecules of endothelial cells showed that in cells treated with Cx43siRNA , the transcript levels of VEGF were decreased and those of KDR were increased , while the other ﬁve molecules remained minimally changed ( Fig . 4 ) . Western blotting further conﬁrmed the reduction of VEGF in cells treated with Cx43siRNA ( Fig . 5a ) . To clarify if the reduction of Cx43 expression in EPC altered the cellular function , the activities of migration , proliferation , and angiogenic potential were evaluated . The results showed that proliferation , detected using BrdU incorporation assay , of the EPCs treated with Cx43siRNA was impaired ( Fig . 5b ) . Chemotactic motility of the EPCs was also attenuated after the treatment with Cx43siRNA , compared to the untreated cells ( Fig . 5c ) . Similarly , angiogenic potential , examined using matrigel assay , was reduced in the treated cells after 48 h of Cx43 - speciﬁc siRNA transfection ( Fig . 5d ) .

Scrape loading / dye transfer experiments demonstrated that cells treated with lipofectamine - only control ( a ) , non - sense control ( b ) , Cx37siRNA ( d ) , and Cx40siRNA ( e ) exhibited similar spread patterns of lucifer yellow ( in green ) . However , cells transfected with Cx43siRNA ( c ) showed attenuated dye transfer . Rhodamine dextran ( in red ) was used to mark the scrape line .

The results showed that the blood ﬂow was augmented over the period of 14 days and the perfusion of the ischemic limb was attenuated in animals given Cx43siRNA - treated cells ( Fig . 6b ) . Immunoconfocal analysis also showed that calf muscle of mice given Cx43siRNA - treated cells had a lower value of capillary density , compared to those treated with nonsense siRNA - treated EPC ( Fig . 6c ) . To clarify the role of VEGF in the process of neoangiogenesis , we co - injected Cx43siRNA transfected EPC and VEGF . The results showed that animals injected Cx43si - transfected EPC and VEGF had no signiﬁcant effect on 14 days post operation compared to the control group of saline injection ( Fig . 6d ) . However , VEGF supplementation showed a higher perfu - sion ration on 21 days post operation compared to the control group of saline . Only the EPC / NS group had sig - niﬁcantly higher perfusion ratio on both 14 and 21 days post surgery , compared to the saline group . Discussion This study clariﬁed two related issues : 1 ) the connexin expression proﬁle of human late EPC and 2 ) the signiﬁ - cance of reduction of Cx43 in the EPC . The results showed that , compared to native endothelial cells HAEC , HUVEC , and MVEC , the EPC did have distinct connexin expression proﬁle . Although all the four types of endothelial cells expressed up to three types of connexins , that is , Cx37 , Cx40 , and Cx43 , the relative expression levels of Cx40 in the EPC is the lowest , compared to the other 3 types of cells . In addition , in the EPC , Cx43 is by far the dominant gap junction protein and the expression level is higher in the high passage number cells , compared to the low pas - sage number cells . Finally , by using siRNA speciﬁc to Cx43 to reduce Cx43 expression in the EPC , we showed that down - regulation of Cx43 per se lead to impaired activity of migration , proliferation , and angiogenesis as well as decreased expression of VEGF transcripts and Fig . 5 Analysis of the level of VEGF , activity of proliferation , migration , and angiogenic potential in EPC transfected with Cx43 - speciﬁc siRNA , as evaluated by Western blotting ( a ) , BrdU incor - poration assay ( b ) , migration assay ( c ) , and tube formation assay ( d ) .

Each experiment was performed at least 3 times in duplicate b 558 Angiogenesis ( 2013 ) 16 : 553 – 560 123 proteins in the EPC . The in vitro ﬁndings were also con - ﬁrmed in murine ischemic hind limb , in which the angio - genic potential of the EPC is attenuated post treatment with Cx43siRNA . These novel ﬁndings expand the knowledge regarding the role of Cx43 in human late EPC . An important ﬁnding of the present study is that reduction of Cx43 per se in human late EPC impaired the activity of migration , proliferation , and angiogenesis . The ﬁnding highlighted a critical role of Cx43 in the EPC . Although the impaired activity seen in EPC treated with Cx43siRNA was similar to those seen in HAEC with the same treatment , differences existed between the two types of treated cells . For example , reduced VEGF in the EPC treated with Cx43siRNA found in the present study was not seen for HAEC treated with Cx43siRNA . In addition , in HAEC treated with Cx43siRNA PAI - 1 and vWF were up - regulated , however , in the present study PAI - 1 and VWF were minimally changed in the treated EPC . These dif - ferences indicated that mechanisms involved in impaired angiogenesis by Cx43 reduction in EPC were different from those of HAEC . On the other hand , since secretion of angiogenic cytokines is considered to play a key role for Fig . 6 Angiogenic potential of EPC transfected with Cx43 - speciﬁc siRNA in hind limb ischemic mice . See text for details . Hind limb ischemic mice injected EPC transfected with 25 nmol / L non - sense ( EPC / NS ) or Cx43 - speciﬁc siRNA ( EPC / Cx43si ) were sacriﬁced at indicated time points and samples derived from calf muscles were applied to ﬂuorescence microscopy . a Experimental goal of in vivo assay . b Laser - Doppler perfusion ﬂowmetry at different time points .

When all the ﬁndings were pooled together , it became reasonable to suggest that in individuals exposed to arsenic compound , Cx43 in the EPC is down - regulated , and such a down - regulation lead to reduced expression of VEGF in the EPC and subsequently impairs the angiogenic potential of the EPC . Interestingly , VEGF supplementation did not fully recover the therapeutic potential impaired by Cx43 down - regulation , which indicated Cx43 was important for the functional integrity of EPC . Our previous studies had shown that down - regulation of Cx43 gap junctions is a common phenomenon seen for endothelial cells exposed to atherogenic factors , such as hypertension [ 16 ] and mechanical injury [ 17 ] . In patients with atherosclerosis , reduced angiogenesis often occurred in the ischemic tis - sues . This phenomenon may be partly attributable to the reduction of Cx43 in the endothelial cells , as shown in our previous studies , as well as to the reduction of Cx43 in the EPC , as revealed in the present study . Clariﬁcation of this requires further studies to examine whether atherogenic factors down - regulate Cx43 in the endothelial cells also down - regulate Cx43 in the EPC , like As 2 O 3 . Similarly , the exact mechanism why reduced expression of Cx43 lead to reduced expression of VEGF required further studies . It should be noted that the pathological effects of arsenic may be due to multiple actions on various cells types , in addi - tion to Cx43 reduction in EPC . Hence , a direct determi - nation of arsenic actions on the affected tissue and EPC is required before linking arsenic and its pathophysiological effect to Cx43 reduction in EPC . In conclusion , Reduced Cx43 expression per se in the EPC causes decreased expression of VEGF and impaired the angiogenic potential of the cells . Prevention of Cx43 reduction is a potential target to maintain the angiogenic potential of the EPC . Acknowledgments We gratefully acknowledge the supports of research grants from Taiwan ( R . O .
