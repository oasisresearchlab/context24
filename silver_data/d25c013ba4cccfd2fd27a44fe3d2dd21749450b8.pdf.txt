Nascent tran - scripts were visualized via MS2 RNA stem loops . The eve stripe 2 transgene exhibits a highly dynamic pattern of de novo transcrip - tion , beginning with a broad domain of expression during nuclear cycle 12 ( nc12 ) , and progressive refinement during nc13 and nc14 . The mature stripe 2 pattern is surprisingly transient , constituting just ∼ 15 min of the ∼ 90 - min period of expression . Nonetheless , this dynamic transcription profile faithfully predicts the limits of the mature stripe visualized by conventional in situ detection methods . Analysis of individual transcription foci reveals intermit - tent bursts of de novo transcription , with duration cycles of 4 – 10 min . We discuss a multistate model of transcription regulation and speculate on its role in the dynamic repression of the eve stripe 2 expression pattern during development . T he Drosophila even - skipped ( eve ) stripe 2 enhancer is one of the best - characterized cis - regulatory DNAs in animal development ( 1 ) . A combination of genetic analyses , DNA binding assays , and site - directed mutagenesis led to a detailed model for the regulation of stripe 2 , whereby the maternal Bicoid gradient , in concert with zygotic Hunchback protein , defines a broad domain of activation in the anterior half of the embryo ( 2 – 5 ) . Localized gap repressors , Giant in anterior regions and Kruppel in central regions , establish the anterior and posterior stripe borders , respectively ( summarized in Fig . 1 A ) . Most of our information regarding the regulation of the stripe 2 expression pattern is derived from the analysis of fixed prep - arations of staged embryos ( 2 , 5 , 6 ) . Here , we use a newly developed live - imaging technique ( 7 , 8 ) to explore the detailed temporal dynamics of the eve stripe 2 expression pattern in living embryos . Multiple copies of an MS2 stem loop sequence were inserted into the 5 ′ - UTR of a yellow reporter transgene ( Fig . 1 B ) . The loops form upon transcription by RNA polymerase II ( Pol II ) and are bound by a maternally provided MS2 coat protein fused to GFP ( MCP - GFP ) ( 9 – 14 ) . As a result , fluorescence signals are detected at sites of Pol II elongation and de novo transcription , and the strength of the signals are proportional to the number of elongating Pol II complexes ( 7 ) . This method was recently used to examine the activation of the proximal hunchback enhancer by the Bicoid gradient in the anterior half of the precellular embryo ( 7 , 8 ) . Diminishing levels of Bicoid were shown to cause stochastic on / off transcription of the hunchback > MS2 transgene at the posterior limits of the Hunchback expression pattern . This observation suggests that the Bicoid activator not only augments the levels of transcription but also increases the probability that a given cell within a pop - ulation will initiate expression ( 15 ) . The regulation of the hunchback > MS2 transgene is rather static . Once activated by Bicoid during nuclear division cycle 10 ( nc10 ) ( 16 ) , the spatial features of the pattern remain essentially constant for the next hour until transcription is lost at the mid - point of nc14 ( 7 , 17 ) . In contrast , the eve stripe 2 pattern is highly dynamic , with broad activation during nc11 and nc12 , followed by progressive refinement during nc13 and nc14 ( 4 ) . These regulatory dynamics are nicely captured by the MS2 detection system and reveal surprisingly transient expression of the mature stripe ( Fig . 1 D and Movie S1 ) . We also present evidence for the occurrence of sporadic transcriptional bursts , with fluctuation cycles of 4 – 10 min . We discuss the possibility that these dis - continuities in de novo transcription facilitate the dynamic reg - ulation of eve stripe 2 expression by the localized Giant and Kruppel repressors . Results The first 1 . 7 kb of the eve 5 ′ flanking region was attached to a yellow reporter gene containing 24 tandem repeats of the 60 - to 70 - bp MS2 stem loop motif [ summarized in Fig . 1 B ( 18 ) ] . The eve > MS2 fusion gene contains the “ full - length ” 720 - bp eve stripe 2 enhancer , located between – 1 . 5 kb and – 800 bp upstream of the eve transcription start ( 4 , 19 ) . It also contains dispersed regulatory sequences that mediate weak expression within the limits of stripe 7 ( Fig . 1 C ) . Conventional in situ hybridization assays identify authentic stripe 2 and stripe 7 expression patterns , as seen for similar eve reporter genes lacking MS2 stem loop sequences ( e . g . , refs . 20 and 21 ) , confirming that the presence of the stem loops does not significantly affect the output pattern of expression . Dynamics of Stripe Formation . The eve > MS2 transgene was introduced into embryos containing a maternally expressed MCP - GFP fusion protein , as described in ref . 7 . Sites of de novo transcription were imaged by sampling a series of confocal z Significance There is considerable information about the spatial regula - tion of gene expression during pattern formation in animal development . Significantly less is known about temporal con - trol , in part due to our inability to analyze gene activity in real time . Using a recently developed approach for the visualization of gene expression in living Drosophila embryos , we examined the well - known even - skipped stripe 2 expression pattern . Sur - prisingly , we observe that this classic pattern is quite transient and generated by discontinuous surges of transcriptional ac - tivity in individual cells . These results challenge a purely static framework for dissecting developmental programs and emphasize the importance of the dynamic features of pattern formation . Author contributions : J . P .

The fluorescence intensities of these expression puncta is a proxy for the number of Pol II molecules actively transcribing the reporter gene and hence is an instantaneous measure of activity ( 7 ) . A broad spatial domain of transcriptional activity is detected during nc11 , nc12 , and nc13 ( e . g . , Fig . 1 D , a – c and Movies S1 – S3 ) . The stripe is gradually refined during nc14 ( Fig . 1 D , d and e ) , and ultimately disappears before the onset of gastrulation ( Fig . 1 D , f ; see below ) . The dynamics of the stripe 2 expression pattern , broad activation followed by localized repression , is consis - tent with previous studies of fixed embryos ( e . g . , ref . 4 ) . As observed in classical studies ( e . g . , ref . 22 ) , there is no evi - dence of transcription during mitosis ( e . g . , Fig . 1 D , a ) . There is a marked restriction in the posterior limits of the reactivated expression pattern following the mitosis at nc13 / nc14 ( Movies S2 and S3 ) . During nc13 , de novo transcription is observed throughout most of the length of the embryo , spanning 10 – 70 % along the anterior - posterior ( AP ) limits of the embryo . However , at the onset of nc14 , the transgene is reactivated within tighter spatial limits , from 20 % to 50 % across the AP axis . This initial nc14 pattern is broader than the final limits of the mature stripe , but considerably more restricted than the pre - nc14 pat - tern ( Movies S2 and S3 ) . The progressive refinement of the mature stripe 2 expression pattern ( Fig . 2 A – C ) is revealed by quantifying the instantaneous fraction of nuclei exhibiting fluorescent signals of de novo transcription . There is relatively uniform activation of eve > MS2 transcription within a broad domain centered at 40 % embryo length of nc13 embryos , This pattern is refined into the mature stripe during a 20 - min window of nc14 ( Fig . 2 D , dashed line ) , but quickly disappears before the onset of gastrulation ( Fig . 2 E ) . The mature stripe 2 pattern is far more transient than the picture formed from conventional in situ hybridization assays using fixed embryos ( e . g . , refs . 20 and 21 ) . Dynamic Regulation Predicts the Mature Expression Pattern . Image analysis methods were used to quantify the signal intensities of individual transcription foci in an effort to understand how the dynamic de novo transcription profile produces a steady - state stripe of expression ( 7 ) . Signal intensities were tracked for individual nuclei during the entirety of nc14 development . Some of these nuclei reside within the limits of the mature stripe , whereas others are located just beyond the anterior and posterior borders of the stripe ( Fig . 3 A ) . Interestingly , there is an overall reduction of signal intensities within the stripe 2 domain at the midpoint of nc14 ( arrow , Fig . 3 A ) . This transient reduction might reflect a change in the regulatory landscape , for example , due to the accumulation of Giant and Kruppel repressors as the mature stripe is formed . A similar reduction in expression was observed for the hunchback > MS2 transgene at ∼ 12 min after onset of nc14 ( 7 ) . By integrating fluorescent traces over time , we calculated the spatial profile of mRNAs produced per nucleus at each time point during nc14 ( Fig . 3 B – D , SI Text , and Movie S4 ) ( 7 ) . The mature stripe of steady - state mRNAs becomes apparent at ∼ 30 min into nc14 , when each nucleus produces ∼ 130 mRNAs ( SI Text ) . To systematically quantify the width of the stripe , a Gaussian curve was fitted to the mRNA accumulation profiles at the end of nc14 ( Fig . 3 D ) . This analysis reveals a mature stripe that is centered at 41 . 0 ± 0 . 1 % egg length with half - maximum at full - width limits of 5 . 3 ± 0 . 1 % egg length . The stripe position is entirely consistent with previous reports based on in situ hy - bridization assays and antibody staining of fixed embryos ( lo - cated between 39 % and 43 % egg length ; see ref . 23 ) . As mentioned above , the de novo transcription profiles pre - dict the final limits of the mature stripe 2 pattern ( Figs . 2 C and 3 C ) as visualized by conventional methods ( Fig . 1 C ) . Thus , posttranscriptional mechanisms , such as differential mRNA stability , are unnecessary to account for the dynamics of the stripe 2 expression pattern . However , mRNA half - life does affect the total number of steady - state mRNAs and proteins present within the stripe . When we assume a half - life of ∼ 7 min , as measured for ftz mRNAs ( 24 ) , the position and width of the stripe remains unchanged , but there is a reduction in the total A B C D Fig . 1 .

Furthermore , assuming a protein translation rate of one protein per mRNA per min ( 25 ) and a protein half - life of 6 – 40 min ( 26 ) , we predict an average of ∼ 1 , 200 Eve proteins per nucleus within the mature stripe 2 domain . It should be possible to test these predictions using quantitative in situ detection methods . Bursts of Transcriptional Activity in Individual Nuclei . The preceding analysis reveals a highly dynamic pattern of de novo transcrip - tion . In an effort to gain insights into the underlying mechanisms , we measured the fluorescence intensities of individual foci dur - ing the entirety of nc14 . There are significant oscillatory fluctu - ations in fluorescence signal intensities during nc14 ( Fig . 4 A and Fig . S2 ) . A typical nucleus within the definitive stripe 2 domain displays reactivation of de novo transcription within ∼ 10 min after the onset of nc14 . There are variable reductions in the levels of transcription followed by surges or bursts of expression . These fluctuations are evocative of transcriptional bursts repor - ted in a number of other systems subject to live - image analysis , including bacteria , yeast , Dictyostelium , and cultured mammalian cells ( 18 ) . Moreover , previous analysis based on fixed Drosophila embryos found evidence of transcriptional bursting at the Hox gene Scr ( 27 ) and in gap gene expression ( 17 ) . Transcriptional “ bursts ” have been associated with promoters that switch between ON and OFF states ( 28 , 29 ) . In this simple “ two - state model , ” transcription occurs only when the promoter is in the ON state and no transcription is permitted when the promoter is in the OFF state ( summarized in Fig . 4 B ) . To determine whether this simple model can describe the fluctua - tions of eve transcription , we calculated the dynamics of Pol II loading based on the fluorescence signal intensities at individual sites of de novo transcription . These signals are a proxy for the number of Pol II molecules actively transcribing the gene ( Fig . 4 A and C ) . Changes in signal intensities can be directly related to the rate of Pol II loading at the promoter ( Fig . 4 D and E ) using a previously described model ( 7 ) ( SI Text ) . We observed highly variable burst cycles of 4 – 10 min , and the production of 20 – 100 mRNAs per typical burst ( Fig . 4 A and E , andFig . S2 ) . Both the time of persistence and the number of mRNAs produced per burst are comparable to those observed in other systems using similar live - imaging methods as well as fixed tissue techniques ( 10 , 11 , 28 , 30 ) .

The temporal progression of the spatial profile of the fraction of active nuclei is also shown in Movie S5 .

The occurrence of multiple rates of Pol II loading argues against a simple two - state model of transcription ( Fig . 4 B ) . Instead , the data are consistent with a “ multistate model , ” with promoter switching between several discrete transcriptional states ( Fig . 4 B and Fig . S2 ) . For both the multistate model and the simpler two - state model , the molecular mechanisms underlying these multiple transcriptional states are uncertain ( see below ) . Discussion During the past 30 years , we have obtained a comprehensive picture of the spatial patterning processes underlying the segmentation of the Drosophila embryo [ e . g . , reviewed by Levine ( 1 ) ] . How - ever , considerably less is known about the temporal dynamics of this process . Here , we applied recently developed live - imaging methods to monitor the transcriptional activity of an eve stripe 2 fusion gene in living Drosophila embryos . We found that the mature eve stipe 2 expression pattern is surprisingly short - lived and persists for only ∼ 15 min after it is fully formed ( Fig . 2 ) . Nonetheless , the temporal dynamics of de novo transcription accurately account for the steady - state expression of eve stripe 2 seen with conventional in situ detection methods ( Fig . 3 ) . A critical observation of this study is the occurrence of transcrip - tional bursts underlying the dynamic eve expression pattern . These bursts are highly variable in duration and in mRNA out - put , and a simple two - state model cannot explain them ( Fig . 4 ) . The ephemeral nature of the stripe 2 expression pattern highlights our ignorance of the temporal dynamics of the segmentation gene network , despite extensive insights into the spatial control of expression ( e . g . , ref . 1 ) . Timing is just as important for developmental fate decisions as the control of the spatial limits , and it is now possible to measure the temporal control of gene expression using newly developed live - imaging methods ( 7 , 8 ) . Indeed , recent evidence suggests that promoters with poised Pol II exhibit more rapid activation dynamics than those lacking poised Pol II , and subtle differences in the timing of expression can influence the coordination of cell invagination events during gastrulation ( 31 ) . Previous live - imaging studies have reported transcription bursts , whereby promoters switch between ON and OFF states ( 10 , 11 , 28 , 30 ) ( Fig . 4 B ) . Such bursts have also been inferred A D E B C Fig . 3 . Dynamics of eve stripe 2 mRNA distribution . ( A ) Mean spot fluorescence , indicating transcriptional activity , as a function of time for different positions along the AP axis of the embryo . The arrow indicates a reduction in the average fluorescence that consistently occurs at about 28 min into nc14 in all embryos observed . ( B and C ) By integrating the total fluorescence as a function of time and assuming no mRNA degradation , it is possible to predict the amount of accumulated mRNA ( SI Text ) . The intensity of the yellow false - color label is proportional to the amount of mRNA produced in each nucleus . ( D ) Total amount of mRNA produced per nucleus , assuming no degradation as a function of position along the AP axis at different time points during nc14 . The absolute number of mRNA molecules should be seen as an estimate ( SI Text ) . ( E ) Number of mRNA and protein molecules per nucleus assuming an eve mRNA half - life of 7 min ( 24 ) , a protein translation rate of one protein per mRNA per min ( 25 ) and a protein half - life of 6 – 40 min ( 26 ) . The exact half - life of eve mRNA that is used for this model has little influence on the qualitative appearance of the stripe ( Fig . S1 and Movie S4 ) . The temporal progression of all parameters is shown in Movie S5 . ( All data were obtained by averaging over four embryos ; error bars correspond to SEMs . ) Bothma et al .

However , our analysis of eve stripe 2 regulation suggests a more nuanced picture of the transcription dynamics . We find evidence for multiple ON states , with each state exhibiting a distinct rate of Pol II loading and release from the eve promoter . Because the nc14 interphase occurs after DNA replication , there are two copies of each allele on adjoining sister chromatids . Independent burst cycles from each copy could contribute to the observed multistate complexity . Additional molecular mechanisms underlying pro - moter switching include occupancy of transcription factor binding sites , nucleosome remodeling , disassembly of the preinitia - tion complex , and stochastic enhancer - promoter looping events ( 32 – 35 ) . It is possible that transcriptional bursting could contribute to the dynamic regulation of the eve stripe 2 expression pattern . In the critical region of refinement , there are overlapping dis - tributions of activators ( Bicoid and Hunchback ) and repressors ( Giant and Kruppel ) . At the beginning of nc14 , the activators have the upper hand and it is only as the concentration of Giant and Kruppel increase that the pattern becomes refined ( 36 ) . Perhaps the “ OFF phase ” of the eve bursts is particularly sus - ceptible to repression during this increase in the levels of Giant and Kruppel . The OFF phase might reflect the uncoupling of the stripe 2 enhancer and transcriptional machinery , thereby ren - dering the enhancer DNA more accessible to the newly synthesized repressors ( e . g . , ref . 37 ) . The hunchback > MS2 transgene exhibits a relatively static pattern of expression ( 7 , 8 ) , and it is currently unclear whether individual nuclei exhibit transcrip - tional bursting behaviors . It remains to be seen whether the transcriptional bursts or surges identified in this study are a general property of gene expression in the Drosophila embryo , or a property of dynami - cally regulated genes such as eve . It is striking that eve tran - scription is stochastic and discontinuous because the Drosophila syncytium exhibits the most rapid regulatory dynamics known in animal development . Future studies will explore the possibility that previously described mechanisms of transcriptional pre - cision , e . g . , paused Pol II and shadow enhancers ( e . g . , ref . 37 ) , somehow suppress transcriptional bursts to produce more uni - form rates of mRNA synthesis .

( 7 ) . Inset ( 51 μ m × 51 μ m ) shows the nuclear location corresponding to the spot using false coloring as in Fig . 3 C . ( B ) The widespread two - state model of transcription posits that promoters can be in an OFF or ON state . Transcription factors can then regulate the rates of interconversion between these two states or the rate of transcriptional initiation in the ON state . In a more general multistate model of transcription , the promoter can be found in the OFF state as well as several ON states , each one of which has a characteristic rate of transcription initiation , i . e . , polymerase loading rate . ( C ) The strength of eve > MS2 fluorescent foci are proportionate to the number of elongating Pol II complexes across the gene template . ( D ) The rate of Pol II loading is related to the spot fluorescence intensity through the time Pol II molecules spend bound to the gene during transcript elongation . Two example time traces of the rate of Pol II loading and their corresponding fluorescence dynamics are shown . In the example for the two - state model , Pol II molecules are loaded onto the gene at a rate r starting at a time t 1 after mitosis resulting in a linear increase of fluorescence . Once the first Pol II molecule reaches the end of the gene and falls off [ ∼ 4 . 2 ± 0 . 4 min ; see Garcia et al . ( 7 ) ] , the number of Pol II molecules on the gene will reach steady state , resulting in a constant fluo - rescence value . At time t 2 , the promoter is switched OFF and the fluorescence intensity will decline as Pol II molecules terminate transcription .

A plasmid construct containing the even - skipped ( eve ) enhancer and promoter region ( − 1 . 7 kb , + 50 bp ) was built using the pbPHi backbone vector containing yellow reporter gene ( 1 , 2 ) . The yellow reporter gene ( 6 . 4 kb ) was used instead of lacZ ( 5 . 3 kb ) ( 3 ) to increase the signal strength , which is proportional to the length of the reporter . This is because the number of transcripts associated with the template is directly proportional to the length of the reporter when the MS2 repeats are placed in the 5 ′ position . Primers used for building the construct are atttgcggccgcCAAGAAGGCTTGCATGTGGG and cgggatccAACGAAGGCAGTTAGTTGTTGACTG . Copies of the MS2 stem loops were extracted from plasmid pCR4 - 24XMS2SL - stable ( Addgene ; 31865 ) by digesting it with BamHI and BglII restriction enzymes . This fragment was ligated into eve - yellow pbPHI vector linearized with BamHI . The eve2 - MS2 - yellow plasmid was integrated on chromosome 3 ( Vk33 ) . In Situ Hybridization and Fluorescence Microscopy . Fluorescent in situ hybridization was performed as described previously using hapten - tagged complementary mRNA probes ( 4 , 5 ) . Embryos were imaged on a Zeiss 700 laser - scanning microscope in z stacks through the nuclear layer at 0 . 5 - μ m intervals using a Plan - Apochromat 20 × / 0 . 8 air lens . Live Imaging Sample Preparation and Data Acquisition . Female vir - gins of line yw ; Histone - RFP ; MCP - NoNLS - GFP ( 3 ) were crossed with males of the reporter line ( eve2 - MS2 - yellow ) . Collected embryos were dechorinated with bleach and mounted between a semipermeable membrane ( Biofolie ; In Vitro Systems & Services ) and a coverslip and embedded in Halocarbon 27 oil ( Sigma ) . Excess oil was removed with absorbent paper from the sides to flatten the embryos slightly . The flattening of the embryos makes it possible to image more nuclei in the same focal plane without causing any detectable change to early development processes ( 6 ) . Embryos were either imaged using a custom - built two - photon microscope ( 7 ) at Princeton and a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal microscope at University of California , Berkeley . On the two - photon microscope , imaging conditions were as described by Garcia et al . ( 3 ) : average laser power at the specimen was 10 mW , a pixel size is 220 nm , and image resolution is 512 × 256 pixels . At each time point , a stack of 10 images separated by 1 μ m was acquired , resulting in a final time resolution of 37 s . Confocal imaging on the Zeiss LSM 780 was performed using a Plan - Apochromat 40 × / 1 . 4 N . A . oil immersion objective . The MCP - GFP and Histone - RFP were excited with a laser wave - length of 488 and 561 nm , respectively . Fluorescence was detected with two separate photomultiplier tubes using the Zeiss QUASAR detection unit ( gallium – arsenide – phosphide photo - multiplier was used for the GFP signal , whereas the conventional detector was used for the RFP ) . Pixel size is 198 nm , and images were captured at 512 × 512 pixel resolution with the pinhole set to a diameter of 116 μ m . At each time point , a stack of 22 images separated by 0 . 5 μ m were captured , spanning the nuclear layer . The final time resolution is 32 s . Live - Imaging Data Analysis . Analysis was performed as described in ref . 3 . Histone - RFP slices were maximum projected for each time point . Nuclei were segmented using a blob detection approach based on the Laplacian of Gaussian filter kernel . The segmented nuclei were then tracked over multiple nuclear cycles . Initially , each time frame of the MCP - GFP channel is treated independently . Spots are detected in 3D using raw images and assigned to their respectively closest nucleus . When multiple spots are detected in the vicinity of the nucleus ( due to segre - gating sister chromatids ) , only the brightest one is kept . When single traces are shown , the automated tracking of both nuclei and spots was checked manually frame by frame using custom analysis code . Spot intensity determination requires an estimate of the local fluorescent background for each particle . Two - dimensional Gaussian fits to the peak plane of each particle column determines an offset , which is used as background esti - mator . The intensity is calculated by integrating the particle fluorescence over a circle with a radius of 6 pixels and sub - tracting the estimated background . Imaging error is dominated by the error made in the fluorescent background estimation ( 3 ) . In ref . 3 , it was possible to measure the average fluorescence per polymerase molecule for the hunchback > MS2 transgene with 24 MS2 repeats . The quantitative imaging for the eve > MS2 trans - gene was conducted under the exact same imaging conditions on the same microscope . The eve > MS2 transgene also possess 24 MS2 repeats . However , the specific sequence of the stem loops is slightly different as these repeats have been further optimized to facilitate molecular biology work with them ( 8 ) . Assuming that the MS2 sites are similarly saturated in both cases , we can then use the average fluorescence per polymerase molecule calculated for the hunchback > MS2 transgene to calibrate the eve > MS2 fluorescent traces in terms of the absolute number of transcribing polymerases per fluorescent spot ( Fig . 4 ) . It is im - portant , however , to point out that this is an estimate and that a direct calibration between fluorescence and MS2 - eve tran - scripts will be necessary for further confidence . We quantified expression domain refinement dynamics by fitting a Gaussian curve to the profile of the fraction of active nuclei as a function of anterior - posterior ( AP ) position at each time point in nuclear cycle 14 ( nc14 ) ( Fig . 2 D , dashed line ) . The fits define an expression domain width over which we determined the instantaneous fraction of active nuclei . The width of the expression domain as well as the fraction of active nuclei refine into the mature stripe pattern during the initial 20 min of expression ( Fig . 2 E ) . Determining the Amount of mRNA Accumulated in the Presence of Degradation . In the experiments reported here , the quantity that is measured is the observed fluorescence in foci of transcription , which is proportional to the number of nascent mRNA molecules associated with a locus at a specific time . This is related to , but not exactly equal to , the rate of mRNA production . One quantity that is of particular interest is how much mRNA has accumulated in individual cells at a specific time point . To connect the measured fluorescence to the amount of mRNA produced by a cell up to a given time , we have to obtain the rate of mRNA production from the fluorescence traces and then account for the corre - sponding mRNA degradation . In the following sections , we give details on how this magnitude is calculated . The first section describes how to connect the measured fluorescence with the rate of mRNA production , and the second describes how we to use the obtained mRNA production rate to estimate the amount of accumulated mRNA in the presence of degradation . Bothma et al . www . pnas . org / cgi / content / short / 1410022111 1 of 7 Relating Measured Fluorescence to mRNA Production Rate . The ob - served fluorescence in foci of transcription as a function of time is given by F ð t Þ . This quantity is linearly related to the number of mRNA molecules associated with the DNA template at a given instant . In our model , mRNA molecules remain associated with the DNA template for as long as it takes the transcribing poly - merase to traverse the length of the gene , E t . Hence , after a time ( E t + t ) , all of the mRNA associated with the active locus at a time t have been released from the template . Thus , F ð t Þ = N p ð t + E t Þ − N p ð t Þ ; where N p ð t Þ is the number of mRNAs that have been produced up to time point t , properly scaled by the average fluorescence intensity for a single mRNA molecule . Now , we can expand N p ð t + E t Þ around E t = 2 , which results in the following : N p ð t + E t Þ = N p (cid:1) t + E t 2 + E t 2 (cid:3) = X ∞ n = 0 N ð n Þ p (cid:1) t + E t 2 (cid:3) n ! (cid:1) E t 2 (cid:3) n : Similarly , we can expand N p ð t Þ , obtaining the following : N p ð t Þ = N p (cid:1) t + E t 2 − E t 2 (cid:3) = X ∞ n = 0 N ð n Þ p (cid:1) t + E t 2 (cid:3) n ! (cid:1) − E t 2 (cid:3) n : As a result , N p ð t + E t Þ − N p ð t Þ = X ∞ n = 0 N ð 2 n + 1 Þ p (cid:1) t + E t 2 (cid:3) ð 2 n + 1 Þ ! (cid:1) E t 2 (cid:3) 2 n + 1 = dN p dt (cid:1) t + E t 2 (cid:3) × (cid:1) E t 2 (cid:3) + h : o : t ; where “ h . o . t ” indicates higher - order terms . This implies that F ð t Þ ≈ dN p dt (cid:1) t + E t 2 (cid:3) × (cid:1) E t 2 (cid:3) and dN p ð t Þ dt ≈ 2 E t × F (cid:1) t − E t 2 (cid:3) : As a result , by integrating the measured fluorescence one can ob - tain , up to a multiplicative constant , the amount of mRNA pro - duced as a function of time . The details on how this is done is detailed in the next section . Relating mRNA Production Rate to Amount of mRNA Accumulated . In the previous section , we derived a connection between the measured fluorescence and the rate of mRNA production . In the absence of mRNA degradation and neglecting diffusion of mRNA between cells , the total amount of mRNA associated with a given nucleus at a given time is as follows : N mRNA ð t Þ = Z t 0 dN p ð τ Þ dt d τ : If we have to allow for mRNA degradation according to first - order kinetics , this simply becomes the following : N mRNA ð t Þ = Z t 0 (cid:1) dN p ð τ Þ dt − λ × N mRNA ð τ Þ (cid:3) d τ : Hence , given some initial conditions and the rate of mRNA pro - duction estimated from our measurements , we can integrate the above equation to obtain the accumulated amount of mRNA present in a cell at a given time . SI Discussion Using the methods explained in the previous sections , it is pos - sible to relate the measured fluorescence ( Fig . S1 A ) to the amount of mRNA accumulated ( Fig . S1 B ) . Fig . S1 B shows how the amount of accumulated mRNA changes with time when one assumes different half - lives . When the mRNA half - life is short , the accumulated amount of mRNA plateaus relatively soon into cell cycle 14 while it steadily increases with time for longer half - lives . The overall levels of mRNA accumulated also scales with the mRNA half - life . One of the things we wanted to get a sense of is how different half - lives of mRNA affect the qualitative profile of the stipe . To look at this , we determined the mRNA accumulation profile for a given embryo assuming different half - lives ( Fig . S1 C and D , and Movie S5 ) . Although there appears to be a modest increase in the width of the stripe as the mRNA half - life is increased , it is not a striking difference . Fig . S1 E shows that increasing the mRNA half - life from 5 to 60 min only leads to a small increase in the number of cells on the boundary of the stripe even though the half - life is varied by more than an order of magnitude . Movie S5 does show how the persistence of mRNA increases as the mRNA half - life is increased . It is not clear how biologically relevant the persistence of the mRNA driven by stripe 2 enhancer is later because there is an autor - egulatory enhancer that takes over from the eve 2 enhancer to drive expression later ( 9 ) . In this study , we have looked at the dynamics of mRNA accumulation . How this will connect to the dynamics of the protein distribution will depend strongly on the half - life of the eve protein in the early embryo . Although this has not been measured for eve , the half - lives of the ftz and engrailed proteins have been measured and both found to be short , < 10 min ( 10 , 11 ) . Hence it is likely that the eve protein will have a lifetime on this order [ also consistent with estimates from modeling work ( 12 ) ] . With such a short half - life , the evolution of the protein pattern will be closely coupled to that of the accumulated mRNA pattern . We relate the fluorescence dynamics to the rate of RNA polymerase II ( Pol II ) loading at the promoter by invoking a simple model previously used to analyze the mean transcrip - tional activity of multiple MS2 spots ( 3 ) . In the following section , we describe the general idea of the models , how they are used to fit the data and extract the single - cell dynamics of transcriptional initiation . A cartoon depicting one possible outcome in the context of a two - state promoter is shown in Fig . 4 B – D . Here , at time t 1 after mitosis Pol II molecules are loaded at a constant rate r . Because at this point in time the gene is devoid of Pol II mol - ecules , the fluorescence will increase as more polymerases escape the promoter and are loaded onto the gene . If the tran - scriptionally active state persists for a time longer than the time required for the first Pol II molecule to reach the end of the gene [ 6 . 4 kbp , which take 4 . 2 ± 0 . 4 min to transcribe ( 3 ) ] , the number of Pol II molecules on the gene will reach steady state , resulting in a constant fluorescence signal . At time t 2 , the promoter switches back to the OFF state and Pol II molecules are not further loaded at the promoter while those that have finished elongation fall off the gene , resulting in a steady decrease of fluorescence intensity . This whole process can be repeated with Bothma et al . www . pnas . org / cgi / content / short / 1410022111 2 of 7 different characteristic times resulting in the modulation of the burst size and frequency . In a “ multistate ” transcription model ( Fig . 4 B – D ) , the promoter can load Pol II molecules onto the gene a varying discrete rates . The result is more complex fluorescence dynamics , but the connection between the fluorescent signal and the rate of tran - scriptional initiation remains the same as in the case of the “ two - state ” transcription model . Fits of the model to the fluorescence data to extract the dynamics of transcriptional initiation were performed manu - ally using custom - written code in Matlab . It is important to point out that these fits should only be seen as an estimate of the dynamics . An unbiased algorithm to fit the data in an automated way is currently under development and will allow for the systematic characterization of these in vivo single - molecule data . 1 .
