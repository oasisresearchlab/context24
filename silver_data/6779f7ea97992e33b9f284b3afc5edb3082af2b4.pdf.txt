Carter 3 1 University of Pennsylvania , Center for Cognitive Neuroscience , 3720 Walnut Street , Philadelphia , PA 10104 - 6241 , USA 2 Princeton University , NJ , and University of Pittsburgh , PA , USA 3 University of California , Davis , CA , USA One hypothesis concerning the human dorsal anterior cingulate cortex ( ACC ) is that it functions , in part , to signal the occurrence of conﬂicts in information proces - sing , thereby triggering compensatory adjustments in cognitive control . Since this idea was ﬁrst proposed , a great deal of relevant empirical evidence has accrued . This evidence has largely corroborated the conﬂict - monitoring hypothesis , and some very recent work has provided striking new support for the theory . At the same time , other ﬁndings have posed speciﬁc chal - lenges , especially concerning the way the theory addresses the processing of errors . Recent research has also begun to shed light on the larger function of the ACC , suggesting some new possibilities concerning how conﬂict monitoring might ﬁt into the cingulate’s overall role in cognition and action . The term cognitive control refers to a set of functions serving to conﬁgure the cognitive system for the perform - ance of speciﬁc tasks , especially in challenging and non - routine situations . A crucial question concerning these functions is : How are they recruited ? One possibility is that control is recruited based , in part , on a function that detects conﬂicts in information processing . In a series of papers , beginning in 1998 [ 1 – 4 ] , we and several colleagues suggested that direct evidence for a conﬂict - monitoring function could be discerned in data from cognitive neuroscience , and in particular work pertaining to the anterior cingulate cortex ( ACC ) . To be more precise , we advanced two interrelated hypotheses : ( 1 ) Speciﬁc brain regions , most notably the dorsal ACC , respond to the occurrence of conﬂicts in information processing , for example response competition ; ( 2 ) This conﬂict signal triggers strategic adjustments in cognitive control , which serve to prevent conﬂict in subsequent performance . A third proposal , also included from the outset , was that conﬂict monitoring might represent one aspect of a more general monitoring function , which detects internal states signaling a need to intensify or redirect attention or control . Since the conﬂict - monitoring hypothesis was ﬁrst proposed , a wealth of new data has appeared , bearing on all three of the foregoing proposals . In many cases , such data has bolstered the account . In others , it has posed challenges . Meanwhile , new proposals have emerged concerning ACC function , modifying the context of the debate . In the present article , we summarize these recent developments , and consider their implications for the conﬂict - monitoring theory . A cortical response to conﬂict The ﬁrst claim of the conﬂict - monitoring theory is that speciﬁc brain structures , and in particular the ACC , respond to the occurrence of conﬂict . This idea was originally motivated by a review of studies in which ACC activation had been observed during the performance of cognitive tasks [ 4 , 5 ] . In the majority of such studies , ACC engagement was associated with one of three behavioral contexts : ( 1 ) tasks that required the overriding of prepotent responses , ( 2 ) tasks that required selection among a set of equally permissible responses ( under - determined responding ) , or ( 3 ) tasks that involved the commission of errors ( Figure 1 ) . Through a series of computational models [ 4 , 6 ] ( see Boxes 1 and 2 ) , we demonstrated how ACC activation in each of these contexts could be explained based on a single function – the detection of conﬂict . Subsequent studies have provided additional evidence concerning the involvement of the ACC in the settings of response override , underdetermined responding , and error commission . In the following , we revisit these three domains , focusing on work published within the past ﬁve years . Response override Tasks requiring the overriding of prepotent responses often involve conﬂict , in the form of competition between the correct response and the one being overridden . The ﬁnding of ACC engagement under such circumstances is , at this point , one of the most ﬁrmly established ﬁndings in all of cognitive neuroscience . The most frequent obser - vation pertains to the Stroop task , where relative ACC activation has been observed in association with incon - gruent trials ( Box 1 ) , a ﬁnding that has been replicated in well over 15 studies ( see [ 5 , 7 ] for reviews ) . ACC activation has also been observed in various versions of the ﬂanker task [ 3 , 8 – 12 ] ( Box 2 ) , in the Simon task [ 13 ] , in the global – local paradigm [ 14 , 15 ] , and in the go / no - go paradigm [ 16 – 18 ] , as well as in other response override tasks [ 1 , 18 – 20 ] .

Consistent with the conﬂict - monitoring hypothesis , underdetermined responding is also a context in which ACC activation is reliably observed . Multiple studies have reported ACC engagement during performance of the stem - completion task [ 21 ] , and the verb generation task [ 22 , 23 ] , as well as during simple motor tasks involving underdetermined responding [ 24 ] . Moreover , there is evidence that ACC activation varies with the number of responses associated with a stimulus , such that greater ACC activation occurs during more underdetermined responding [ 22 , 23 ] . Errors Another well - established ﬁnding is that the ACC transi - ently activates in association with the commission of errors . This activation has been studied most extensively using electroencephalography ( EEG ) , where it takes the form of a transient potential referred to as the error - related negativity ( ERN ) [ 25 , 26 ] , but error - related ACC engagementhasalsobeenobservedusingfMRI [ 1 , 18 , 27 , 28 ] . Behavioral and electromyographic observations indi - cate that errors in speeded response tasks are frequently associated with response conﬂict [ 6 ] . This is because , even as an error response is being executed , ongoing processing of the stimulus often leads to a belated activation of the correct response , giving rise to a transient period during which both correct and incorrect responses are activated . The resulting association of errors with post - response conﬂict suggests that ACC activation during errors , like its activation during response override and underdeter - mined responding , might reﬂect another instance of conﬂict detection . Recent computational modeling work by Yeung et al . [ 6 ] shows that the conﬂict - monitoring theory can account for numerous detailed aspects of the ERN , including several features that were previously unexplained . One important prediction of this work was that an EEG potential resembling the ERN should be discernable in association with correct responses , if these are associ - ated with response conﬂict . Just such a potential , referred to as the N2 , has now been reported in multiple studies [ 6 , 29 , 30 ] ( Box 2 ) . It follows from the conﬂict - monitoring theory that error - related activity should be observed in the same area within the ACC that responds during high - conﬂict correct responses . This prediction has been conﬁrmed with fMRI [ 1 , 31 ] . However , other studies have added a twist . In three experiments [ 18 , 27 , 28 ] , errors have been found to engage two distinct regions within the ACC : a posterior region that responds during both errors and high - conﬂict correct responses , but also a more anterior region , which responds preferentially to errors . The dissociation is not clear - cut : Braver et al . [ 18 ] have provided evidence that the anterior region does respond during high - conﬂict correct trials , although less strongly than to errors . Furthermore , evidence suggests that the ERN , a focus of work on error processing , is linked to the more posterior area [ 30 ] . Nevertheless , this possible fractionation of function within the ACC is an important area for further research . Another ﬁnding with apparent implications for the conﬂict - monitoring theory is that an evoked potential , resembling the ERN , occurs in response to feedback indicating the commission of an error [ 32 , 33 ] . It is not known , at present , whether this ‘feedback - related nega - tivity’ ( FRN ) derives from the same portion of the cingulate that generates the ERN ; fMRI experiments , aimed at answering this question , have yielded conﬂicting results [ 34 , 35 ] . Furthermore , some evidence suggests that the FRN might be linked to conﬂict between actual and expected events [ 36 ] . Even if the FRN did turn out to Oculomotor Vocal Manual Figure 1 .

Conﬂict monitoring in the Stroop task The Stroop task has provided a useful setting in which to evaluate the conﬂict - monitoring hypothesis . Here , subjects name the color in which words are displayed , and respond faster when the words themselves name that same color ( congruent trials ) than when they name a different color ( incongruent ) . Computational models have accounted for this reaction time difference in terms of crosstalk between processing pathways underlying color - naming and word - reading , culminating in conﬂict – the simultaneous activation of incompatible , and competing , representations . We used one such model ( Figure Ia ) to show how conﬂict monitoring might explain the frequent ﬁnding of ACC activation during incongruent trials in the Stroop task [ 4 ] . The approach was to add a new element to the Stroop model , a ‘conﬂict - monitoring’ unit that took input from the response layer of the base model , and became active during response competition ( blue elements in Figure Ia ) . This model also implemented the claim that conﬂict monitoring inﬂuences control : the activity level of the conﬂict - monitoring unit inﬂuenced the state of units responsible for representing the current task , such that periods of high conﬂict caused the model to become more focused on the color - naming task , displaying less interference from the task - irrelevant word - reading pathway . This led the model to show less Stroop interference when incongruent trials were frequent than when they were rare , a pattern that has been observed in human performance ( Figure Ib ) . Note that , if the conﬂict - monitoring theory is correct , variations in trial - type frequency should affect not only behavior , but ACC activation as well . Just as the behavioral data indicate that incongruent trials induce more conﬂict when such trials are rare , ACC activation during incongruent trials should also be greater under these conditions . fMRI data have conﬁrmed this prediction [ 38 ] ( Figure Ic ) . Another prediction of the conﬂict - monitoring theory is that the state of cognitive control should vary depending on the level of ACC activation on preceding trials . In the setting of the Stroop task , the theory predicts that high ACC activation should trigger an increased focus on the color - naming task , leading to less Stroop interference on the next trial . This prediction was conﬁrmed in a recent neuroimaging study [ 63 ] ( Figure Id ) .

Review TRENDS in Cognitive Sciences Vol . 8 No . 12 December 2004 541 www . sciencedirect . com represent a genuine response to feedback , this would still leave the question of how errors are detected as they occur ( that is , before or in the absence of feedback ) , because this is when the ERN occurs . At present , the only available explanations for this on - line form of error detection rest upon some version of conﬂict monitoring [ 6 , 25 , 36 ] . An evaluative rather than regulative role According to a competing account , ACC activation reﬂects not a signal of conﬂict , but instead the application of top - down control [ 37 ] . At least ﬁve studies have tested between these two views , and in each case the evaluative account provided by the conﬂict - monitoring theory has been supported over the competing , regulative view . In each study , two conditions of ACC activation were compared : one involving high response conﬂict and weak top - down control , and one involving low conﬂict and a high level of top - down control . In two studies involving the Stroop task [ 38 , 39 ] ( Box 1 ) and three using the ﬂanker task [ 3 , 8 , 9 ] ( Box 2 ) , ACC activation was found to be greater in high - conﬂict / low - control trials , suggesting that it is more closely tied to conﬂict detection than to top - down control . The special status of response conﬂict Conﬂict can occur at numerous levels of information processing , ranging from perceptual representation , to stimulus categorization , to response selection and task representation . Several studies have examined whether the ACC responds to conﬂict at all of these levels , or whether it is sensitive only to certain forms of conﬂict . In general , such studies have supported the conclusion that the ACC is engaged most strongly during conﬂicts at the level of response selection [ 10 , 11 , 15 , 40 – 42 ] , a ﬁnding that accords with the strong connectivity between the ACC and motor structures including premotor , supplementary motor , and primary motor areas [ 43 , 44 ] . If response conﬂict were the only type of conﬂict to engage the ACC , the data might be consistent with the view that the ACC is itself essentially a motor structure , but perhaps one concerned with selecting among compet - ing responses [ 19 , 45 ] . Although this possibility cannot be ruled out , it is important to note that several studies have provided evidence for ACC activation in the setting of conﬂict at other levels of processing , including stimulus evaluation [ 15 , 41 , 46 ] and task representation [ 20 ] , point - ing to a broader monitoring function . Localization of the conﬂict response In the majority of studies addressing the issue , the ACC response associated with conﬂict has been localized to a region overlying the cingulate sulcus , approximately two centimeters rostral to the anterior commissure plane [ 44 , 47 , 48 ] ( Figure 1 ) . This lies within Brodmann’s areas 24 and 32 , in a region also referred to as the anterior rostral cingulate zone [ 47 ] . In some recent work [ 12 , 49 – 52 ] , it has been suggested that the relevant activations might instead lie more dorsally , within the pre - supplementary motor area . One limitation shared by the relevant studies is that , given their design , comparisons between conditions could reﬂect differences in strategy or control state rather than differences in conﬂict , either because stimulus presentation was blocked , or because ( as in [ 50 ] ) different portions of the reaction - time distribution were considered for different trial types . This , combined with the large number of studies where conﬂict - related responses have been loca - lized to the ACC , creates some difﬁculty in accepting the idea that such responses in fact reside more dorsally . However , this is clearly an issue that deserves further research . Further questions about localization arise from work with non - human primates . Schall and colleagues [ 53 , 54 ] observed conﬂict - related neural activity in supplementary Box 2 . Conﬂict monitoring in the ﬂanker task In the ﬂanker task , subjects are asked to identify a central letter ( or other simple target ) but to ignore ﬂanking items . Subjects respond more slowly when the ﬂankers are associated with a different response from the one associated with the target ( incompatible , as opposed to compatible , trials ) . Like incongruent trials in the Stroop task ( see Box 1 ) , incompatible ﬂanker trials involve crosstalk between task - relevant and task - irrelevant processing pathways , leading to the activation of incompatible and competing representations – that is , conﬂict . A speciﬁc account of this crosstalk has been provided by computational models such as the one shown in Figure Ia ( black portion ) [ 78 ] . In neuroimaging studies of the ﬂanker task , greater ACC activation has been observed on incompatible than compatible trials [ 3 , 8 – 10 , 12 ] , a ﬁnding interpreted by the conﬂict - monitoring theory as a signal of conﬂict . Botvinick et al . [ 4 ] simulated this imaging result by adding a conﬂict - monitoring unit to the basic ﬂanker task model ( blue elements in Figure Ia ) . This unit became active when units in the response layer of the underlying model were simultaneously active ; that is , during response conﬂict . In keeping with the conﬂict - monitoring theory , this unit also fed forward to inﬂuence the control state of the underlying model ; high activation of the conﬂict - monitoring unit triggered an intensiﬁcation of top - down support for the processing of the central target item in the input . This link from conﬂict monitoring to control led the model to show more target - focused behavior following incompatible trials than following compatible trials , a pattern also observed in human performance ( Figure Ib ) . In addition to this behavioral sequence effect , the conﬂict - monitoring theory predicts a sequence effect at the level of ACC activation . The fact that behavior becomes more focused following incompatible trials means that less conﬂict should occur during incompatible trials when thesefollow other incompatibletrials . Basedonthis , the theorypredicts that ACC activation on incompatible trials should be greater following compatible trialsthan following incompatibleones . Thisprediction was conﬁrmedinanfMRIstudyoftheﬂankertask [ 3 ] ( FigureIc ) , theresultsof which have recently been replicated and extended [ 8 ] . The ﬂanker task has also been frequently used in studies of the neural response to error - commission , and in particular in studies of the ERN . Yeung et al . [ 6 ] used the model in Figure Ia to show how ACC activation associated with errors could reﬂect a reaction to conﬂict , speciﬁcally conﬂict between the error response and the ( belatedly activated ) correct response . A key aspect of the model is that it explains why ACC activation should be linked both to errors and to high - conﬂict correct responses . Importantly , however , the model also suggests that the timing of conﬂict – and thus of ACC activation – should be qualitatively different in the two cases , tending to precede the overt response on correct trials and to follow it on errors . This predicted difference in the timing of ACC activation has been conﬁrmed in two separate EEG experiments [ 6 , 30 ] ( Figure Id ) . Review TRENDS in Cognitive Sciences Vol . 8 No . 12 December 2004 542 www . sciencedirect . com eye ﬁeld , but not in ACC ( but see [ 45 ] ) . Although these studies encourage the idea that conﬂict - related activation lies outside the ACC , it should be noted that they used a version of the go / no - go task , a task which has been clearly shown to engage the ACC in humans [ 16 , 18 ] . The reasons for this and other contradictions between human and monkey data are not fully understood . It could be that the cingulate response reﬂects neural synchronization [ 55 ] or synaptic events , detectable through EEG or fMRI ( the techniques usually applied in humans ) , but not evident at the level of single - unit spike trains ( as collected from monkeys ) . Furthermore , there are cytoarchitectonic differences between human and monkey ACC [ 56 ] , which make it plausible that functional differences also exist . In view of such considerations , it would be very useful if single - unit recording experiments like those that have been undertaken with monkeys could be conducted with Box 3 . Questions for future research † How is conﬂict detection translated into compensatory adjust - ments in cognitive control ? How detailed is the information that the conﬂict - monitoring function conveys to centers responsible for cognitive control , and how is this information used to generate a strategic response ? † What are the neuronal events underlying conﬂict - associated ACC activation , as observed with neuroimaging ? What factors explain the fact that conﬂict - related ACC activity is ubiquitous in human neuroimaging studies , but has not yet been clearly observed in monkeys ? † What is the relationship between conﬂict monitoring and error monitoring in the brain ? Are errors detected based on the conﬂict they involve , or does error monitoring rely upon fundamentally different mechanisms ( or are both of these statements true ) ? † Data support the view that the ACC is involved in conﬂict monitoring , but also the view that it is involved in action - outcome monitoring and / or reward - based decision - making . Are these per - spectives mutually exclusive , or can they be reconciled ?

The feasibility of such work has been demon - strated by Davis and colleagues [ 57 ] , who reported activation of single neurons within human ACC during performance of cognitively demanding tasks . It would also undoubtedly prove illuminating to apply fMRI or intra - cranial EEG to non - human primates , in behavioral contexts similar to those that have produced ACC activation in humans . Conﬂict monitoring and the modulation of control According to the conﬂict - monitoring hypothesis , the ACC response to conﬂict triggers strategic adjustments in cognitive control , which serve to reduce conﬂict in subsequent performance . Initial evidence for this proposal was drawn from cognitive psychology , where several observations suggested the occurrence of adjustments in strategy following the occurrence of conﬂict . For example , Gratton et al . [ 58 ] showed , in the ﬂanker task , that interference is reduced following incompatible trials ( Box 2 ) , and analogous effects have been observed in the Stroop task ( Box 1 ) , the Simon task [ 59 ] , and elsewhere [ 60 ] . Recent research has demonstrated ( pace [ 61 ] ) that such sequence effects cannot be attributed entirely to perceptual or motor priming [ 62 ] . By contrast , as has been shown through computational modeling [ 4 ] , such effects can be explained in quantitative detail by the conﬂict - monitoring hypothesis ( Boxes 1 and 2 ) . Accord - ing to this explanation , the observed ﬂuctuations in behavior reﬂect reactive adjustments in cognitive control , triggered on a trial - by - trial basis by conﬂict signals from the ACC . This account gives rise to a crucial prediction concern - ing the relationship between ACC activation and sub - sequent performance . Speciﬁcally , strong ACC engagement should be followed by behavior reﬂecting relatively focused attention ( strong top - down control ) , and weak ACC engagement by less focused behavior . A striking conﬁrmation of this prediction was reported by Kerns and colleagues [ 63 ] , in the context of the Stroop task ( Box 1 ) . They found that , when incongruent trials were associated with high ACC activity , relatively low inter - ference was observed on the subsequent trial . This ﬁts well with the idea that strong ACC engagement leads to a reinforcement of top - down control . Consistent with this , Kerns and colleagues observed that , following trials with strong ACC engagement , there was relatively strong activation in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex , a brain region closely associated with cognitive control . Consistent with previous studies , Kerns also observed ACC engagement in association with errors [ 63 ] . Inter - estingly , the magnitude of this error response was related to post - error performance , with higher activation associ - ated with a relatively large slow - down in reaction times . This ﬁnding is consistent with the proposal , put forth by Botvinick et al . [ 4 ] , that post - error slowing might be a consequence of conﬂict monitoring . Although the same relationship between ACC activation and post - error slowing has been observed elsewhere [ 26 , 31 ] , this must be reconciled with other studies , where apparent dis - sociations between the ERN and post - error behavior have been reported [ 64 , 65 ] . The data presented by Kerns and colleagues [ 63 ] provide strong support for the proposal that ACC activity is linked to subsequent shifts in cognitive control . Also consistent with this claim are the results of several neuropsychological studies , where abnormalities in cog - nitive control have been observed following ACC lesions [ 66 , 67 ] . Having said this , it should be acknowledged that neuropsychological ﬁndings have been quite variable . Some studies have found no clear - cut deﬁcits in cognitive control , noting instead problems with response selection [ 68 ] or autonomic function [ 69 ] . Further work clarifying the effects of ACC damage is warranted . Conﬂict monitoring in the larger context of ACC function As noted earlier , an important assertion of the conﬂict - monitoring hypothesis is that conﬂict monitoring consti - tutes one instance of a more general evaluative function . In earlier work , we suggested that the ACC might serve to detect events or internal states indicating a need to shift the focus of attention or strengthen top - down control ( [ 4 ] , see also [ 20 ] ) , an idea consistent , for example , with the fact that the ACC responds to pain [ 48 ] . Although this idea remains plausible , recent research also provides a larger context in which to consider the relation between conﬂict monitoring and the overall function of the ACC . Action - outcome evaluation and reward - based action selection Several recent studies have suggested that the ACC serves to evaluate action outcomes . Gehring and Wil - loughby [ 70 ] , for example , reported ACC engagement when subjects were informed of the outcomes of their decisions in a gambling task . This study , and others [ 33 , 71 – 73 ] , suggest that the ACC responds disproportio - nately to outcomes considered aversive or signaling reductions in reward . It has been proposed , further , that the overall function of the ACC might involve the use of outcome , and particularly reward - related , information to guideactionselection [ 45 , 72 – 74 ] . Rushworthandcolleagues [ 49 ] suggest that the ACC guides action selection based on a cost – beneﬁt analysis , integrating information about past action outcomes . A particularly interesting suggestion is that this cost – beneﬁt analysis might take into account the effort associated with candidate actions [ 75 ] . It might turn out that some ﬁndings underlying the action - outcome account can be better explained in terms of conﬂict detection ( see [ 35 ] ) . However , on the whole , the evidence for this view of ACC function appears reasonably compelling . What are the implications of this new perspective for the conﬂict - monitoring theory ? It is tempting to view the outcome evaluation account as an exclusionary alternative to the conﬂict - monitoring view . After all , the outcome account addresses phenomena that seem difﬁcult to explain in terms of conﬂict monitoring ( for example , ACC activation relating to reward expectation [ 72 ] ) . However , it should be noted that the converse is also true : the outcome evaluation account , in its present form , provides no explanation for much of the data addressed by conﬂict monitoring ( e . g . the pervasive ﬁnding of ACC engagement in situations involving response override and underdetermined Review TRENDS in Cognitive Sciences Vol . 8 No . 12 December 2004 544 www . sciencedirect . com responding ) . Indeed , some of the very studies upon which the outcome evaluation view are based have found it necessary to invoke conﬂict monitoring to account for all of their ﬁndings ( e . g . [ 34 ] ) . In view of this , it seems misguided to reject one of these two views of ACC function in favor of the other . Instead , the data invite a consider - ation of how action - outcome evaluation and conﬂict monitoring might ﬁt together within a larger account of ACC function . Towards an integrative account One promising way of reconciling the two accounts is to consider that conﬂict monitoring might simply constitute one instance of a more general outcome monitoring function . That is , if the ACC is involved in monitoring and evaluating the outcomes of actions , it may be that conﬂict is among the outcomes to which the ACC is sensitive . This proposal ﬁts with the suggestion that the ACC responds to events indicating a reduction in reward [ 73 ] , given that responses associated with conﬂict tend to be slower and less accurate than low - conﬂict responses , and thus less likely to fulﬁll task objectives ( indeed , post - response conﬂict can be a very sensitive and speciﬁc indicator of error ; see Box 2 ) . At the same time , the proposal provides a way of linking the putative role of the ACC in action - outcome evaluation with ACC engage - ment during response override and underdetermined responding . A possible extension of this proposal is suggested by the claim that the ACC encodes information about effort [ 49 , 75 ] . With this in mind , it is interesting to consider the hypothesis that conﬂict might serve as an index of the demand for mental effort . Consistent with this , it has been noted that the ACC becomes active in just those task settings that are experienced as cognitively difﬁcult [ 37 , 76 ] . Indeed , as we have argued elsewhere [ 4 ] , the induction of conﬂict can plausibly be considered to be a deﬁning feature of difﬁcult tasks . The ACC has also been shown to be the generator of the midline theta rhythm , an EEG oscillation that is characteristically observed during intense concentration [ 77 ] . In addition , there is evidence suggesting that the ACC is importantly involved in linking mental effort to the autonomic changes that typically accompany it [ 69 ] . Together , these existing ﬁndings make it seem plaus - ible that the ACC might monitor conﬂict as an index of task difﬁculty ( and / or the mental effort it demands ) , entering this into cost – beneﬁt analyses underlying action or strategy selection . This proposal is , of course , speculat - ive , and further research will be needed to evaluate its merit ( see also Box 3 for other future research issues ) . However , it does serve to indicate how recent ﬁndings concerning the ACC might be integrated with the increasingly abundant evidence for engagement of the ACC by conﬂict .
