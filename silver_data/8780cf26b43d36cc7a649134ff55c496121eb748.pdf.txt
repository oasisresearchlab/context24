Clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) is the best - described uptake pathway and regulates nutrient uptake , protein and lipid turnover at the plasma membrane ( PM ) , cell signaling , cell motility and cell polarity . The main protein in CME is clathrin , which assembles as a triskelion - looking building block made of three clathrin heavy chains and three clathrin light chains . Compared to clathrin heavy chains ( CHCs ) , the role of the two isoforms of clathrin light chains ( CLCA and CLCB ) is poorly understood . Here , we conﬁrm that the simultaneous deletion of both CLCA / B causes abnormal actin structures at the ventral PM and we describe them , for the ﬁrst time , as functional invadopodia rather than disorganized actin - cytoskeleton assembly sites . Their identiﬁcation is based on the occurrence of common invadopodia markers as well as functional invadopodia activity characterized by an increased local proteolytic activity of the extracellular matrix proteins . We demonstrate that CLCA / B deletion impacts the intracellular trafﬁcking and recovery of the matrix metalloproteinase 14 ( MMP14 ) leading to its accumulation at the plasma membrane and induction of invadopodia formation . Importantly , we show that invadopodia formation can be prevented by depletion of MMP14 . As such , we propose that CLCA / B regulate invadopodia formation by regulating MMP14 delivery to the plasma membrane . Keywords : clathrin light chain ; invadopodia ; MMP14 : actin ; membrane trafﬁcking 1 . Introduction Uptake of biomolecules from the extracellular environment is the most fundamental cellular process . Clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) is the most important and best characterized endocytic pathway and regulates nutrient uptake , protein and lipid turnover at the plasma membrane , cell signaling , cell motility and cellular polarity [ 1 – 3 ] . CME is a very complex process that relies on the coordinated recruitment of multiple proteins to initiate the formation of a clathrin - coated pit ( CCP ) at the plasma membrane , which will drive membrane invagination and ultimately lead to the release of clathrin - coated vesicles ( CCVs ) into the cytosol [ 4 , 5 ] . The building blocks for CCP and CCV formation are clathrin triskelia . A clathrin triskelion consists of three clathrin heavy chains ( CHCs ) and three clathrin light chains ( CLCs ) [ 3 ] . CHCs are fundamental for CME as they form the structural backbone of the triskelia while CLCs appear to usually be dispensable for CME [ 6 , 7 ] . Vertebrates possess two clathrin light chain isoforms , clathrin light chain A ( CLCA ) and clathrin light chain B ( CLCB ) , which are the result of the duplication of an ancient gene [ 8 ] . CLCA and CLCB are ubiquitously expressed in mammalian tissue , with the exception of lymphoid cells that seem to have only CLCA [ 9 ] . CLCA and CLCB are similarly organized and have about 60 % sequence identity . CLCB has a unique serine Cells 2021 , 10 , 451 . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 3390 / cells10020451 https : / / www . mdpi . com / journal / cells Cells 2021 , 10 , 451 2 of 25 phosphorylation site close to the N terminus of the protein ; whereas , CLCA has an addi - tional Hsc70 stimulating region [ 2 , 10 ] . The functions of CLCA and CLCB remain poorly understood . Silencing experiments of both CLCA and CLCB reported little to no impact on CME of transferrin or epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) [ 6 , 7 ] . However , recent work exploiting CRISPR / Cas9 editing technology shows that cells expressing only CLCB exhibit an increased rate of CME compared to cells expressing only CLCA or cells expressing both CLCs [ 11 ] . CLCs were also reported to be important for the uptake of a subset of G protein - coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) [ 9 , 12 ] and , more recently , it has shown that site speciﬁc phosphorylation of CLCB regulates GPCR endocytosis but not endocytosis of transferrin , by promoting the transition from ﬂat to curve clathrin lattices [ 13 ] . Transition from ﬂat to curved lattices represents a key step during CME [ 14 ] and in vitro studies have proposed that CLCs contribute to the tensile strength of the clathrin coat , which will help bending artiﬁcial membranes [ 15 ] . CLCs were reported to interact with the actin cytoskeleton via binding to huntingtin interacting protein 1 ( Hip1R ) [ 2 , 16 ] . Coupling of CLCs to the actin - cytoskeleton has been shown to be important for endocytosis of unconventionally large cargo such as bacteria or certain viruses [ 17 , 18 ] or at sites of increased membrane ten - sion [ 19 ] . Furthermore , CLCA acts together with Myosin VI to generate the force required for endocytosis at polarized tissue [ 20 ] . As such , there is growing evidence for a light chain speciﬁc function in regulating CME . Beside their role in endocytosis , CLCs have been described to have an important function in intracellular trafﬁcking and cargo recycling to / from the plasma membrane . Gene silencing of both CLCA and CLCB expression results in a perturbed trafﬁcking of the cation - independent mannose - 6 - phosphate receptor which was found to be trapped in the trans - Golgi compartment [ 7 ] . Interestingly , knock - out of both CLCA and CLCB was also found to induce the accumulation of actin patches but their identity and function remains unclear [ 7 , 21 , 22 ] . Similarly , CLCs were shown to be important for the recycling of β 1 integrin back to the plasma membrane [ 21 ] and , thereby , inﬂuencing cell migration [ 21 ] and cell spreading [ 11 , 23 ] . Finally , deletion of CLCA in B cells impairs both their maturation in the germinal center and antibody isotype switching . Selective recycling and internalization of signaling receptors like TGF β R2 , CXCR4 , and DOR mediated by CLCA were proposed to be the underlying mechanisms [ 9 ] . In this study , we use CRISPR / Cas9 mediated genome editing to sequentially deplete both CLCs . We conﬁrm the appearance of aberrant actin accumulations following both CLC isoforms deletion . Using qualitative and functional assays , we describe these actin struc - tures as functional invadopodia based on the presence of common invadopodia markers as well as their association with discrete proteolytic activity of the extracellular matrix . We could show that deletion of both CLCs induces the accumulation of the matrix metallopro - teinase MMP14 at the plasma membrane , which , in turn , promotes invadopodia formation . Accumulation of MMP14 was due to its increased trafﬁcking from intracellular compart - ments to the plasma membrane and not to a defect in internalization . As such , our work further highlights the importance of CLCs in regulating intracellular trafﬁcking of cargo molecules and describes a novel function of CLCs in regulating invadopodia formation . 2 .

To allow for the recycling of internalized MMP14 , cells were put back at 37 ◦ C for an additional 30 min . After this short incubation the recycled surface biotin was again stripped as described above . Cells were lysed using a buffer composed of 1 % Triton X - 100 , 0 . 1 % SDS , 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM EDTA and 50 mM HEPES at pH 7 . 5 , and incubated on ice for 30 min , followed by short sonication and centrifugation to remove cell debris . Protein concentration was assessed and normalized using a DC protein assay kit ( Biorad ) and then the same amount of protein per sample was added to high capacity NeutrAvidin agarose beads ( Thermo Fisher ) , and incubated overnight at 4 ◦ C under gentle agitation . The following day , the supernatant was removed and beads were washed two times with 1M NaCl , 50mM HEPES , 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 ( pH 7 . 4 ) and two times with 50mM HEPES ( pH 7 . 4 ) , followed by a 20 min incubation at RT with Laemmli buffer containing 5 % SDS , 100 mM NaCl , 100 mM DTT , and 5 % B - Mercaptoethanol . The eluted biotinylated proteins were then boiled and loaded onto acrylamide gels for Western blotting . 2 . 20 .

Cells were incubated for 1 , 6 and 12 h with 10 µ g / mL cycloheximide ( Sigma ) . For surface MMP14 samples , cells were incubated on ice with MMP14 antibody for 30 min prior ﬁxation with 2 % PFA / PBS . Total MMP14 samples were either lysed with Laemmli buffer or ﬁxed with 2 % PFA / PBS and processed for WB analysis or IFA , respectively . 2 . 21 .

Tracking of Clathrin Structures The software ilastik ( http : / / ilastik . org ( accessed on 17 August 2020 ) ) was used for tracking CME events as described in [ 24 ] , in brief : Images were segmented using pixel classiﬁcation and object classiﬁcation workﬂows . The automatic tracking workﬂow was used for tracking single clathrin events . The maximum distance of two neighboring objects was set to 5 to avoid merging . Tracking results were analyzed using an automated KNIME workﬂow ( lifetime , maximal ﬂuorescence intensity and average position ) . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . Loss of Both CLCA and CLCB Induces Aberrant Actin Patches That Can Be Rescued by Expression of a Single CLC To investigate the functions of CLCA and CLCB , we used CRISPR / Cas9 genome editing to sequentially deplete both CLC isoforms in the astrocyte derived cell line U373 . Following selection and single cell cloning , successful genome editing was conﬁrmed by im - munoblotting and sequencing . In WT cells , both CLCA and CLCB were detectable whereas only CLCB and CLCA were detectable in CLCA − / − and CLCB − / − cells , respectively ( Figure 1A ) . Knock - out of a single clathrin light chain was associated with a 20 % increase in the expression level of the other isoform ( Figure 1A ) . Deletion of both CLCA and CLCB in the double knock - out U373 cell line was conﬁrmed both by immunoblotting ( Figure 1A ) and by immunoﬂuorescence assay ( IFA ) ( Figure 1B ) and CLC deletion had minimal effect on CHC expression ( Supplementary Figure 1A ) . To monitor the impact of CLC deletion on CME , we performed a transferrin internalization assay in both single ( CLCA − / − and CLCB − / − ) and double CLC KO cell lines and compared it to WT cells . As expected , knock - out of either or both CLCs did not impact the clathrin - mediated internalization of transferrin ( Supplementary Figure S1B , C ) . Complementarily , we monitored the dynamic of CME in WT cells and compared it to cells lacking CLCs . Analysis of the lifetime of the CCPs present at the ventral membrane of cells showed no signiﬁcant differences between WT and CLCs depleted cells ( Supplementary Figure S2 ) . Together , these results conﬁrm previous observations that CLCs do not participate in regulating CME of “conventional” cargo molecules [ 6 , 7 ] . It has been previously observed upon siRNA - mediated CLCA / B knock - down that actin patches assemble at the ventral plasma membrane of cells [ 7 , 21 ] . Here , upon CRISPR / Cas9 mediated knock - out of CLCA / B , we report a similar accumulation of actin at the plasma membrane . In WT cells , actin was mostly forming ﬁbrillar structures corre - sponding to stress ﬁbers ( Figure 1C , D ) . On the contrary , upon deletion of both isoforms of CLCs , actin was found in patches clustered under the nucleus ( Figure 1C , D ) . Importantly , in cells depleted of either CLCA or CLCB , actin was mostly found in ﬁbrillar structures and cells did not display actin patches ( Figure 1D and Supplementary Figure S3 ) . This observa - tion strongly suggests that both CLCs share redundant functions in regulating formation of these actin patches . Similar results were observed when using different clones of CLCA and / or CLCB knock - out cell lines strongly supporting that this phenotype is speciﬁc for the deletion of CLCs and not a consequence of single cell cloning ( data not shown ) .

Cells displaying actin patches were quantiﬁed , displayed as the mean and SD , n = 3 , 300 cells per condition . Cells 2021 , 10 , 451 10 of 25 To validate the critical role of CLCA and CLCB in regulating actin patch formation , we performed rescue experiments where either CLC isoforms where overexpressed in CLCA − / − CLCB − / − double knock - out cell lines . Human CLCA or CLCB fused to the red ﬂuorescent protein ( RFP ) or RFP alone were expressed in both WT and CLCA − / − CLCB − / − U373 cells . Cells were observed using confocal microscopy and analyzed for the presence or absence of actin patches . Fluorescently tagged CLCs have been previously reported to be functional and to be incorporated into clathrin - coated structures upon overexpression into cells [ 26 ] . Here , we conﬁrmed that RFP - tagged CLCA and CLCB form discrete foci in U373 cells corresponding to clathrin - coated structures ( Figure 2A ) . The fraction of these clathrin foci also containing AP2 corresponds to CCPs at the plasma membrane ( Figure 2A ) . Importantly , overexpression of either RFP - tagged CLCA or CLCB in WT cells did not alter the actin cytoskeleton compared to mock transfected cells ( Sup - plementary Figure S4A , top panel ) or cells expressing RFP alone ( Figure 2A , top panel ) . Quantiﬁcation did not reveal any signiﬁcant differences in the number of cells displaying actin patches between WT cells or WT cells overexpressing RFP - tagged CLCA or CLCB ( Figure 2B ) . On the contrary , overexpression of either RFP - tagged CLC isoforms in the CLCA − / − CLCB − / − knocked - out cells lead to a strong reduction of the number of cells displaying actin patches ( Figure 2A , bottom panel and Figure 2B , Supplementary Figure S4A , bottom panel and Figure S4B ) . Complementarily , live cell analysis of cells overexpress - ing the ﬂuorescently - tagged CLCA clearly demonstrates that the disappearance of actin patches coincides with the onset of CLCA expression ( Supplementary Movie 1 ) . Together , these results strongly support a model where deletion of CLCA and CLCB induces the formation of actin patches . Interestingly , a HIP1R binding deﬁcient CLCB mutant ( CLCB QQN ) has been reported to induce similar actin patch formation [ 7 , 16 , 27 ] in WT cells . Thus , overexpression of the HIP1R binding deﬁcient mutant in WT cells resulted in the generation of actin patches ( Supplementary Figure S4A , B ) . Overexpression of CLCB QQN in CLCA − / − CLCB − / − cells was not able to rescue the actin patch formation ( Supplementary Figure S4A , B ) . Altogether , our results conﬁrm previous observations reporting that deletion of CLCs induce the formation of actin patches at the plasma membrane . Importantly , expression of a single CLC isoform is sufﬁcient to rescue this phenotype highlighting the redundant functions of CLCs in regulating actin patch formation . 3 . 2 . CLC Deletion Causes Functional Invadopodia Formation Deletion of both CLCs induce the formation of actin patches at the plasma membrane ( Figures 1C and 2A ) . Apart from focal adhesions ( FA ) , which are large actin - rich macro - molecular structures that are located at the cell periphery and mediate the mechanical linkage of the cell with the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) , invadopodia are another type of actin - containing structures that are located at the ventral plasma membrane mediating interaction with the ECM . Invadopodia are important during embryonic development , tissue positioning , bone remodeling as well as during spreading of metastatic cancer [ 28 , 29 ] . Fluorescence confocal imaging revealed structural similarities between invadopodia and the actin patches observed in cells depleted of CLCA and CLCB ( Figures 1 and 2 ) . To conﬁrm whether the actin patches observed upon CLCA and CLCB deletion are invadopo - dia , WT and CLCA − / − CLCB − / − cells were stained for common invadopodia markers and analyzed using confocal microscopy . We used the actin nucleator Arp3 , the matrix metalloproteinase MMP14 , zyxin and Cortactin as markers for invadopodia [ 29 , 30 ] . In CLCA − / − CLCB − / − cells , the aberrant actin patches labelled with ﬂuorescent phalloidin were found associated with all invadopodia markers Arp3 , MMP14 , zyxin and Cortactin ( Figure 3A – D ) . Colocalization analysis using Pearson correlation coefﬁcient revealed that there is signiﬁcantly more Arp3 , MMP14 , zyxin and Cortactin associated with actin - rich structures in CLCA − / − CLCB − / − cells compared to WT cells ( Figure 3E – H ) . In WT cells , actin positive structures were only found associated with zyxin ( Figure 3C ) . These structures were identiﬁed as FAs as they displayed ﬁbrillar morphology and were located Cells 2021 , 10 , 451 11 of 25 at the periphery of the cells . Interestingly , an enrichment of the clathrin adaptor AP2 in actin patches co - localizing with invadopodia markers was observed in CLC depleted cells ( Figure 3A – D and Supplementary Figure S5A ) which is in agreement with a previous report showing that clathrin structures and invadopodia are often found in close proximity [ 31 , 32 ] . Together , these results strongly suggest that the actin patches resulting from deletion of CLCs are invadopodia . Cells 2021 , 10 , x FOR PEER REVIEW 11 of 28 Figure 2 .

Cells 2021 , 10 , 451 13 of 25 An additional hallmark of invadopodia is their protease activity driving local degrada - tion of the ECM during cell migration and invasion [ 29 , 33 ] . To fully demonstrate that our observed actin patches are functional invadopodia , WT and CLCA − / − CLCB − / − cells expressing zyxin fused to the ﬂuorescent protein mCherry ( mCherry - zyxin ) were seeded on ﬂuorescently labelled gelatin . Using live cell confocal microscopy , we monitored gelatin digestion over time and spatially correlated digestion locations with the position of our actin patches . As expected , in WT cells , digestion of the extracellular gelatin occurred at the leading edge of the cell and was driven by FAs . Digestion of the ECM in the middle of the cell body was only rarely observed in WT cells ( Figure 4A – C and Supplementary Video S2 ) . Interestingly , although similar digestions were observed at the leading edge of CLCA − / − CLCB − / − cells , we also observed a pronounced digestion of gelatin directly underneath the cell bodies and this digestion appeared to be mediated by invadopodia structures marked by mCherry - zyxin ( Figure 4D – F , arrow heads and Supplementary Video S3 ) . All together , we could show that upon deletion of both isoforms of CLCs , actin patches assem - ble at the ventral plasma membrane of cells and these structures display all qualitative and functional hallmarks of invadopodia . As such , our results strongly suggest that CLCA and CLCB participate in the regulation of invadopodia formation . 3 . 3 . MMP14 Is Upregulated in CLC Depleted Cells To address the mechanisms by which deletion of CLCA and CLCB induces formation of invadopodia , we turned our attention to the key function of these structures which is their proteolytic activity mediated by matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) . MMP14 is one of the key components of invadopodia and a critical regulator of their formation and function [ 34 ] . It was previously reported that the membrane bound MMP14 is able to induce the accumulation of invadopodia - associated proteins which in turn lead to invadopodia formation [ 35 , 36 ] . To test whether deletion of both isoforms of CLCs lead to MMP14 accumulation at the plasma membrane , which in turn would induce the local formation of invadopodia , we analyzed the relative protein level of MMP14 in WT and CLCA − / − CLCB − / − cells . Western blot analysis revealed that cells depleted of both CLCs contain more MMP14 compared to WT cells ( Supplementary Figure S5B ) . This accumulation of MMP14 was conﬁrmed by immunoﬂuorescence analysis of both WT and CLCA − / − CLCB − / − cells ( Figure 3B ) . Accumulation of MMP14 at the plasma membrane in CLCA − / − CLCB − / − cells could be the result of an altered internalization rate of MMP14 from the plasma membrane or an increased trafﬁcking of MMP14 from intracellular storage compartments ( or biosynthetic pathway ) to the plasma membrane . To discriminate between both of these possibilities , we utilized a microscopy as well as cytometry - based internalization assay in which the kinetics of uptake of surface MMP14 was measured . First , by ﬂuorescently labelling all surface MMP14 ( Figure 5A , total surface MMP14 ) , we could show that CLCA − / − CLCB − / − cells have more MMP14 present at their cell surface compared to WT cells ( Figure 5B , C ) . This ﬁnding is consistent with the increased amount of invadopodia at the surface of cells depleted of both CLCs ( Figure 3B ) . To directly address whether the accumulation of MMP14 at the surface of CLCA − / − CLCB − / − cells was the result of an impaired internalization of MMP14 , the cell surface pool of MMP14 was ﬁrst saturated with anti - MMP14 antibody on ice . Cells were then transferred at 37 ◦ C for 30 min to let MMP14 be internalized by the cells . The remaining surface bound MMP14 associated antibody was washed off using a low pH buffer and the internalized pool of MMP14 was revealed using a ﬂuorescent secondary antibody ( Figure 5A ) . Quantiﬁcation revealed that in cells depleted of both CLCs , more MMP14 was found internalized ( Figure 5C ) . However , normalization of the internalized amount of MMP14 to the total amount of MMP14 at the surface of the cells revealed no differences between WT and CLCA − / − CLCB − / − cells ( Figure 5D ) . These results suggest that although CLCA − / − CLCB − / − cells have more MMP14 , the internalization rate of this matrix metalloproteinase is not altered compared to WT cells .

Loss of CLCs Leads to Increased MMP14 Intracellular Trafﬁcking towards the Plasma Membrane To address whether the accumulation of MMP14 was the result of increased MMP14 trafﬁcking towards the plasma membrane , we used Fluorescent Recovery after Photobleach - ing ( FRAP ) . To focus our analysis strictly on the surface exposed MMP14 , we exploited the GFP derived pHluorin protein . This pH sensitive ﬂuorescent protein displays very little Cells 2021 , 10 , 451 17 of 25 to no ﬂuorescence when localized in an acidic environment ( e . g . , endosomes ) while its ﬂuorescence intensity increases in neutral or basic pH [ 37 ] . As such , when fused to MMP14 ( MMP14 - pHluorin ) , the fraction of MMP14 localized in the intracellular trafﬁcking com - partments is not ﬂuorescent while the fraction located at the cell surface is . When expressed in WT cells , MMP14 - pHluorin displays a typical uniform membrane localization while in CLCA − / − CLCB − / − cells , MMP14 - pHluorin reveals plasma membrane - associated structures that are reminiscent of invadopodia ( Figure 7A ) . Importantly , we found that these structures were positive for markers of invadopodia ( e . g . , Arp3 and zyxin ) and were associated with active digestion of ﬂuorescent gelatin ( data not shown ) . These observations conﬁrm that fusion of MMP14 to pHluorin does not interfere with its incorporation into in - vadopodia and with their functions . FRAP measurement in WT or CLCA − / − CLCB − / − cells expressing MMP14 - pHluorin revealed that following photobleaching , the ﬂuorescence of both membrane - associated and invadopodia - associated MMP14 recovered over time ( Figure 7A , B ) . Analysis revealed that although the recovery rate ( T - half : time to recover half the ﬂuorescence intensity ) was identical between WT and CLCA − / − CLCB − / − cells ( Figure 7C ) , the ﬂuorescence intensity fully recovered in cells depleted of both CLCs while only 80 % of the ﬂuorescent signal was found in WT cells after recovery ( Figure 7B , D ) . These results show that the mobile fraction of MMP14 in CLCA − / − CLCB − / − cells is greater compared to WT cells . This observation strongly suggests that trafﬁcking of MMP14 from intracellular compartments toward the plasma membrane is more efﬁcient in cells depleted of both CLCs . To further conﬁrm this ﬁnding , we employed a biotinylation approach using a non cell - permeable biotin analogue to label the proteins and receptors present on the cell surface , in order to dissect the uptake and recycling to the plasma membrane of biotin - labelled surface MMP14 in more detail ( Supplementary Figure S6A ) . To precisely determine the fraction of “internalyzed” , “total” and “non recycled” MMP14 , we ﬁrst controlled the efﬁciency of the stripping approach by removing the biotin groups from labelled proteins ( see methods for details and Supplementary Figure 6C ) . We then quantiﬁed and compared the ratio of labelled endocytosed and recycled ( re - trafﬁcked to the cell surface ) MMP14 with labelled endocytosed but non - recycled ( still internalized ) MMP14 from WT and CLCA − / − CLCB − / − cells ( Supplementary Figure S6A , schematic and Supplementary Figure S6B ) . CLCA − / − CLCB − / − cells were able to recycle more MMP14 from the endocytosed biotin labelled MMP14 pool compared to WT cells conﬁrm - ing that CLC deletion causes an upregulation in MMP14 recycling to the plasma membrane ( Supplementary Figure S6D ) . Complementarily , we controlled the impact of protein neo - synthesis on surface MMP14 levels by blocking protein synthesis using cycloheximide treatment ( Supple - mentary Figure S7 ) . The observed overall increase in surface MMP14 in both WT and CLCA − / − CLCB − / − over time during cycloheximide treatment is likely due to the fact that the surface pool of MMP14 is constantly internalized and recycled but is tightly con - trolled and remains relatively stable ( Supplementary Figure S7B , C ) . The newly synthesized MMP14 , however , decreases over time due to the block of protein neosynthesis and has a direct impact on the total amount of MMP14 ( Supplementary Figure S7A , B ) . Both WT and CLCA − / − CLCB − / − surface / total MMP14 ratios increase equally over time , suggesting that WT and CLCA − / − CLCB − / − cells are equally affected by cycloheximide treatment ( Supplementary Figure S7C ) . Even more strikingly , after 12h of cycloheximide treatment , almost 50 % of the total MMP14 pool of CLCA − / − CLCB − / − cells consist of the surface MMP14 fraction , which indicates even further that the increase in MMP14 surface trafﬁck - ing is due to increased recycling and not due to protein neosynthesis .

Loss of MMP14 Prevents Invadopodia Formation in CLCA − / − CLCB − / − Cells Finally , to demonstrate that MMP14 accumulation at the plasma membrane of CLCA − / − CLCB − / − cells is directly responsible for invadopodia formation [ 38 ] , we knocked - down MMP14 in WT and CLCs depleted cells using shRNA ( Figure 8A ) . While in CLCA − / − CLCB − / − cells , most of the cells ( > 80 % ) display invadopodia structures , upon silencing of MMP14 , we observed a signiﬁcant reduction of the number of cells having invadopodia ( Figure 8B , C ) . Importantly , knock - down of MMP14 did not impact the organization of the ﬁbrillar actin cytoskeleton ( stress ﬁbers ) ( Figure 8B ) . Interestingly , knock - down of MMP14 in WT cells also resulted in the depletion of the few invadopodia structures that are naturally present in these cells ( Figure 8B , C ) .

Discussion Deletion of both CLCs in cells causes the assembly of abnormal actin patches . In this work , we identify the nature of these actin structures and could demonstrate that they show all characteristics of invadopodia rather than disorganized actin - cytoskeleton patches . Identification of these actin patches as functional invadopodia was based on the presence of common invadopodia markers as well as spatially increased proteolytic activ - ity ( gelatine digestion ) . Formation of these invadopodia structures requires the loss of both CLCA and CLCB but could be rescued by overexpression of either CLCs , suggesting that both CLCA and CLCB have a redundant function in regulating their formation . Fi - nally , we found that formation of these structures was due to the accumulation of MMP14 at the plasma membrane in CLCA and CLCB depleted cells . This accumulation was not due to a defect in CME and MMP14 turn over from the plasma membrane but rather due Figure 8 .

These ﬁndings highlight a novel function of CLCA and CLCB in regulating invadopodia formation . 4 . Discussion Deletion of both CLCs in cells causes the assembly of abnormal actin patches . In this work , we identify the nature of these actin structures and could demonstrate that they show all characteristics of invadopodia rather than disorganized actin - cytoskeleton patches . Identiﬁcation of these actin patches as functional invadopodia was based on the presence of common invadopodia markers as well as spatially increased proteolytic activity ( gelatine digestion ) . Formation of these invadopodia structures requires the loss of both CLCA and CLCB but could be rescued by overexpression of either CLCs , suggesting that both CLCA and CLCB have a redundant function in regulating their formation . Finally , we found that formation of these structures was due to the accumulation of MMP14 at the plasma membrane in CLCA and CLCB depleted cells . This accumulation was not due to a defect in CME and MMP14 turn over from the plasma membrane but rather due to an increased intracellular trafﬁcking of MMP14 towards the plasma membrane . Furthermore , we also showed that knock - down of MMP14 reduced invadopodia formation in CLC depleted cells , demonstrating that MMP14 is key for invadopodia formation upon CLC deletion . Thus , our work further highlights the fact that CLCs have limited functions in regulating endocytosis but play a critical role in regulating intracellular trafﬁcking and sorting of cargo to the plasma membrane . Deletion of both CLCs induced actin patch formation at the ventral plasma membrane ( Figure 1 ) . These observations conﬁrm the long known interplay between CLCs and the actin cytoskeleton as similar actin accumulations at the plasma membrane were previously reported upon siRNA mediated knockdown of CLCs [ 7 , 21 , 22 ] . Accumulation of these actin structures at the plasma membrane required the deletion of both CLCA and CLCB . Individual knock - out of CLCA or CLCB was found to be not sufﬁcient for inducing the formation of these invadopodia structures and this actin patch phenotype could be rescued by expression of either one of the CLC isoforms ( Figure 2 ) , highlighting the redundant function of both CLCs in regulating actin patch / invadopodia formation . These ﬁndings are in agreement with previous works [ 7 , 21 ] ; however , it was shown that in the HeLa cell line , transient knock down of CLCA alone was sufﬁcient for inducing the formation of actin structures at the plasma membrane [ 23 ] . While we cannot exclude that these discrepancies might reﬂect cell type speciﬁc different functions of CLCA and CLCB , it is possible that these discrepancies arise from the different strategies used to deplete CLCs : knock - out ( in this work ) vs . siRNA mediated knock - down CLCs [ 23 ] . In cells transiently depleted of one CLC , the remaining CLC does not have the time to take over the impaired function of the depleted one . On the contrary , in cells knock - out for one CLC , the remaining CLC will be able to functionally replace the depleted one due to the time necessary to perform the single cell clonal expansion of the knock - out cell line . We actually observe a higher expression level of CLCB in cells knocked - out for CLCA , and vice versa ( Figure 1A ) . Within this possibility , this would suggest that although both CLCs can compensate for each other loss , in physiological condition , CLCA would be responsible for regulating actin patch formation . However , a recent study reported decreasing levels of MMP14 upon CLCB silencing [ 39 ] and we observe the same ﬁnding in decrease in MMP14 expression in CLCB − / − cells ( Supplementary Figure S5B ) , suggesting that CLCB is also involved in regulating invadopodia formation . Overexpression in cells of a CLCB mutant lacking the binding site of the actin orga - nizer HIP1R [ 16 ] ( Supplementary Figure S4 ) and siRNA - mediated knock - down of HIP1R also induced the formation of similar actin patches [ 7 , 21 , 40 , 41 ] . As HIP1R was shown to interact with cortactin at endocytic sites and regulate actin ﬁlament formation [ 42 ] it was proposed that these aberrant actin structures upon HIP1R deletion / depletion are due to Cells 2021 , 10 , 451 21 of 25 impaired actin ﬁlament formation through loss of HIP1R binding to cortactin [ 7 , 40 ] . Indeed , we observe an accumulation of cortactin at actin structures in cells ( Figure 3D ) as well as an attenuation of HIP1R in clathrin - coated structures in CLC depleted cells ( Supplementary Figure S8 ) . Here we described that the actin structures that accumulate upon deletion of CLCA and CLCB are functional invadopodia [ 7 , 43 , 44 ] . These invadopodia structures contain integrins , focal adhesion - related proteins ( i . e . , talin , zyxin ) , actin and actin poly - merization and branching mediating proteins ( Cortactin , WASP , Arp2 / 3 ) . Interestingly , we also observed the presence of AP2 in these invadopodia structures ( Figure 3 and Sup - plementary Figure S5A ) , and recruitment of AP2 seems to take place after digestion of the extracellular environment by MMP14 ( Figure 4E , F ) . In some rare instances , AP2 forms unusual ﬁlamentous “tail - like” structures which appear to follow actin ( Figure 3A ) . The origin and function of these structures remain to be determined , but we hypothesize that clathrin structures are involved in the activity of invadopodia , probably by mediating local recycling of membranes and internalization of extracellular compounds . This is consistent with the observation that clathrin structures are found at invadopodia [ 31 , 32 ] . We could show that upon CLC deletion , the trans - membrane metalloproteinase MMP14 , a key component of invadopodia and essential for ECM degradation [ 41 ] , was upregulated at the protein level ( Supplementary Figure S4 ) and was enriched at the ventral plasma membrane ( Figures 3B , 5B and 6B ) . The reasons for MMP14 accumulation into cells are not clear but are very likely associated with its accumulation at the plasma membrane in invadopodia structures . MMP14 surface expression is tightly regulated and upregulation of MMP14 coincides with malignant cancer progression [ 45 – 47 ] . Interestingly , a recent publication demonstrated that the MMP14 interaction with the ECM alone , independently of the catalytic activity is important for assembly of mature invadopodia [ 36 ] . Thus , the described elevated MMP14 surface levels of CLC knock - out cells ( Figures 3B , 5B and 6B ) alone might be sufﬁcient to prime invadopodia formation , since silencing of MMP14 in CLCA − / − CLCB − / − cells abolished invadopodia formation ( Figure 8 ) . Given the impor - tance of CME to regulate the surface expression of MMP14 [ 34 ] , we monitored the kinetic of MMP14 uptake from the plasma membrane using either ﬂow - cytometry or confocal microscopy ( Figures 5 and 6 ) . We could show that the endocytic rate of MMP14 was not signiﬁcantly different between WT and cells depleted of CLCA and CLCB ( Figures 5C and 6C ) . Thus , altered endocytosis of MMP14 in CLCs depleted cells is likely not the reason for MMP14 surface accumulation . Using a FRAP microscopy approach , we were able to show that the surface accumu - lation of MMP14 was the result of an increased trafﬁcking of MMP14 from intracellular compartments to the plasma membrane ( Figure 7 ) . The half - time of ﬂuorescence was the same between WT and CLCA − / − CLCB − / − cells , indicating similar intracellular trafﬁck - ing rates ( Figure 7D ) . Interestingly , we could show that while WT cells only recovered to about 80 % of their initial ﬂuorescence , cells depleted of both CLCs fully recovered , indicat - ing that deletion of CLCA and CLCB increases the mobile fraction of MMP14 ( Figure 7B , C ) . Recently , it was shown that knockdown of the Phosphatidylinositol 4 - kinase II β ( PI4KII β ) similarly induces the formation of invadopodia [ 35 ] . This was caused by increased traf - ﬁcking of MMP14 via exocytic endosomal compartments to the plasma membrane leading to invadosome formation . As such , it is possible that PI4P levels and CLCs co - operate to regulate MMP14 trafﬁcking to the plasma membrane . Upon CLC deletion , trafﬁcking of several cargo was reported to be perturbed : CIMPR was trapped in the TGN and recy - cling of β 1 integrin as well as signaling receptors like TGF β R2 , CXCR4 , and DOR were impaired [ 7 , 9 , 21 ] . As such , we propose that CLCs negatively regulate MMP14 to prevent MMP14 accumulation and invadopodia formation . Interestingly , the actin binding protein cortactin was proposed to not only be involved in forming the actin scaffold for invadopodia but rather promote the secretion of secretory vesicles containing MMPs including MMP14 [ 46 , 48 ] . Together with the previously de - scribed mechanisms that HIP1R binding to cortactin inhibits actin assemblies at endocytic sites , and with the fact that CLC deletion disrupts the localization of HIP1R to endocytic Cells 2021 , 10 , 451 22 of 25 sites [ 7 , 42 ] , we propose the following model : Deletion of CLCA and CLCB causes upregu - lation of MMP14 recycling to the plasma membrane ( Figure 9 ) . The consequence of CLC deletion is the disruption of HIP1R recruitment to endocytic sites , more speciﬁcally to cortactin . In turn , the unbound cortactin drives actin polymerization , which causes actin patch formation . Cortactin simultaneously promotes secretory vesicles containing MMP14 , thereby causing accumulation of both actin and MMP14 . The actin structures as well as MMP14 clustering form the scaffold for further invadopodia maturation . Cells 2021 , 10 , x FOR PEER REVIEW 25 of 28 Figure 9 .
