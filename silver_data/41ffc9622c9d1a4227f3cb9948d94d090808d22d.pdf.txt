Although O - proﬁle closure limits release but recycles vesicles economically , O - proﬁle merging facilitates release but couples to classical endocytosis for recycling . Despite its crucial role in determining exocytosis / endocytosis modes , how O - proﬁle merging is mediated is poorly understood in endocrine cells and neurons containing small B 30 – 300 nm vesicles . Here , using confocal and super - resolution STED imaging , force measurements , pharmacology and gene knockout , we show that dynamic assembly of ﬁlamentous actin , involving ATP hydrolysis , N - WASP and formin , mediates O - proﬁle merging by providing sufﬁcient plasma membrane tension to shrink the O - proﬁle in neuroendocrine chromafﬁn cells containing B 300 nm vesicles . Actin - directed compounds also induce O - proﬁle accumulation at lamprey synaptic active zones , suggesting that actin may mediate O - proﬁle merging at synapses . These results uncover molecular and biophysical mechanisms underlying O - proﬁle merging .

NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | 7 : 12604 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms12604 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications 1 V esicle fusion releases vesicular contents such as hormones , peptides and transmitters , to mediate many biological processes crucial to an animal’s life , such as stress responses , mood changes , synaptic transmission , neuronal net - work activity , and immune responses 1 – 4 . It is executed via formation of an O - shape intermediate structure , termed O - proﬁle , at the plasma membrane for releasing contents , followed by closure ( called kiss - and - run ) or merging of the O - proﬁle into the plasma membrane ( called full fusion ) 1 – 4 . O - proﬁle closure limits vesicular content release and cargo delivery , but recycles vesicles economically 1 , 2 . In contrast , O - proﬁle merging allows for rapid , complete content release and cargo delivery , but couples exocytosis to classical endocytosis involving membrane invagination , O - proﬁle formation and ﬁssion , for retrieving merged vesicles 1 – 3 . In other words , O - proﬁle merging deﬁnes the mode of fusion ( full fusion versus kiss - and - run ) and the mode of endocytosis ( classical endocytosis versus kiss - and - run ) . Despite these fundamental roles , the mechanism underlying O - proﬁle merging is unclear in endocrine cells and neurons where vesicles are r B 300nm and fusion takes place rapidly after calcium inﬂux . O - proﬁle merging is often assumed to be a passive , automatic process with no energy consumption once fusion pore opens in neurons and neuroendocrine cells . O - proﬁle merging has recently been studied in secretory cells containing extremely large vesicles ( B 1 - 5 m m ) , such as in Xenopus oocytes 5 , human endothelial cells , lacrimal epithelial acinar cells 6 , parotid and pancreatic acinar cells 7 , 8 , and type II pneumocytes 9 , where O - proﬁle merging and release take extremely long time ( tens of seconds to tens of minutes ) and release is not as tightly coupled to calcium inﬂux as in neuroendocrine cells and neurons ( reviewed in ref . 10 ) . These studies suggest that cytoskeletal ﬁlamentous actin ( F - actin ) may coat the fusing O - proﬁle in a few to tens of seconds after fusion , which may mediate two seemingly opposite functions : to compress the fusing O - proﬁle and thus to merge the O - proﬁle with the plasma membrane , or to hold the O - proﬁle from collapsing into the plasma membrane . Whether and which of these mechanisms apply to endocrine cells and neurons containing smaller vesicles remain unclear , mostly due to difﬁculty of detecting the very transient process of O - proﬁle merging in smaller vesicles . In the present work , we overcame the difﬁculty of detecting O - proﬁle merging in smaller vesicles by confocal imaging and super - resolution stimulated emission depletion ( STED ) imaging in neuroendocrine chromafﬁn cells 11 and by electron microscopy ( EM ) at lamprey synapses . Combined with pharmacological tools and gene knockout ( KO ) , we found that dynamic assembly of cytoskeletal F - actin is necessary for O - proﬁle merging in chromafﬁn cells . With imaging and manipulations of plasma membrane mechanical forces , our results suggest that F - actin mediates O - proﬁle merging by providing sufﬁcient tension at the plasma membrane to shrink the O - proﬁle . We also found that the F - actin assembly pathway including hydrolysis of the energy molecule ATP , neuronal Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein ( N - WASP ) and formin that activate F - actin assembly participates in mediating O - proﬁle merging . F - actin - mediated O - proﬁle merging is probably applicable to synapses , because block of F - actin led to accumulation of O - proﬁles at the active zone of lamprey giant synapses . These results uncover novel molecular and biophysical mechanisms underlying O - proﬁle merging in neuroendocrine cells and neurons , which mediates full fusion and couples exocytosis to classical endocytosis . Results Imaging in conditions that facilitate X - proﬁle merging . We used a recently developed technique to image O - proﬁle merging in live , primary - cultured bovine adrenal chromafﬁn cells containing B 300 nm dense - core vesicles in a bath solution containing membrane - impermeable Alexa Fluor 647 ( A647 ) and Alexa Fluor 488 ( A488 ) ( Fig . 1a ) 11 . Cells were voltage clamped at (cid:2) 80 mV and stimulated with 10 pulses of 50 ms depolarization to þ 10 mV at 2 Hz ( Train 2Hz ) . The resulting calcium current ( ICa ) and capacitance increases that reﬂect fusion were whole - cell recorded ( Fig . 1b ) . During and within 3 s after Train 2Hz , A647 and A488 spots reﬂecting dye - ﬁlled fusion - generated O - proﬁles appeared 11 ( Fig . 1c – f ) . Consistent with our previous ﬁndings using a 1 s depolariza - tion 11 , O - proﬁles may change in seven patterns ( Supplementary Fig . 1a ) , which are grouped into three categories ( Fig . 1c ) as follows : ( 1 ) the O - proﬁle shrinks until undetectable , leading to O - proﬁle merging with the plasma membrane , termed O - shrink fusion ; ( 2 ) the O - proﬁle is maintained while its size may remain unchanged , enlarged or shrink to some extent , termed stay fusion ; and ( 3 ) the stay fusion is followed by pore closure , termed close fusion 11 . With confocal imaging of A647 and A488 ( every 20 – 40 ms ) at the cell bottom using strong and weak excitation , respectively ( confocal A647 strong / A488 weak setting ) 11 , O - shrink was identiﬁed as parallel decay of A647 and A488 spot ﬂuorescence ( F 647 and F 488 , respectively ) to baseline , whereas A647 ( or A488 ) spot size , measured from the full - width half - maximum ( W H ) , reduced until below confocal resolution ( Fig . 1d and Supplementary Fig . 1b , c ; for detail , see ref . 11 ) . Stay fusion was identiﬁed as the persistence of the A647 and A488 spot for 4 30 s ( our recording time ; Fig . 1e ) . During stay fusion , the spot’s W H may remain unchanged , reduce to some extent or enlarge , whereas F 647 and F 488 changed in parallel ( Supplementary Fig . 1d ; for detail , see ref . 11 ) . Close fusion was reﬂected as stay fusion followed by bleaching of the spot F 647 to baseline , but no change of F 488 signal ( Fig . 1f and Supplementary Fig . 1e ) , because pore closure prevented exchange of bleached A647 ( due to strong excitation ) with ﬂuorescent A647 in the bath , resulting in the decay of the spot F 647 , but not the weakly excited F 488 ( ref . 11 ) . These three categories were conﬁrmed with several other methods , including high - resolution STED microscopy ( for example , Supplementary Fig . 1c ) 11 . With 1 s depolarization , we previously found that O - shrink fusion percentage increases as ICa decreases 11 . To search for stimulation protocols that facilitate O - shrink fusion , we decreased ICa charge by reducing the depolarization duration to 50 ms . To induce more granule fusion , we used 10 pulses of 50 ms depolarization at 2 Hz ( Train 2Hz ) . With Train 2Hz , 68 ± 4 % of fusion events were O - shrink fusion , 29 ± 3 % were stay fusion and 3 ± 2 % were close fusion ( Fig . 1g , h ; n ¼ 18 cells , total fusion spots : 192 ; ± indicates s . e . throughout this study ) . Similarly , whole - cell dialysis of 1 . 5 m M free calcium induced mostly O - shrink fusion ( Fig . 1i ) . Throughout this study , we used Train 2Hz to induce fusion if not mentioned otherwise . Dynamic F - actin assembly mediates X - proﬁle merging . Application of latrunculin A ( Lat A , 3 m M , bath ) , which disrupted F - actin polymerization 12 , reduced O - shrink fusion from 68 to 19 % ( 13 cells ) , increased stay fusion from 29 to 76 % , but did not affect close fusion ( Fig . 2a , b ) . The remaining O - shrink fusion in the presence of Lat A had a longer F 647 decay time constant ( t , 2 . 8 s , for example , Fig . 2c ; summarized in Fig . 2d ) than in control ( 1 . 2 s , for example , Fig . 1d , g ) , indicating a reduction in O - proﬁle shrinking rate . Thus , Lat A slows down or blocks O - proﬁle shrinking . The percentage decrease in O - shrink fusion was mirrored by the increased stay fusion percentage ( Fig . 2b ) , indicating that Lat A converts O - shrink to stay fusion . Similarly , another actin polymerization inhibitor cytochalasin D ( Cyto D , ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms12604 2 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | 7 : 12604 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms12604 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications 4 m M , bath ) 13 , 14 inhibited O - shrink and increased stay fusion , suggesting that actin polymerization mediates O - proﬁle merging ( Fig . 2b , d and Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . As expected 12 – 14 , Lat A and Cyto D signiﬁcantly reduced F - actin labelled with overexpressed Lifeact - TagGFP2 ( Lifeact ) at the cell bottom where we examined fusion ( Fig . 2e , f ) . Similar to Lat A / Cyto D , wiskostatin ( 10 m M ) , which inhibits N - WASP - mediated , Arp2 / 3 - dependent F - actin assembly 15 , and SMIFH2 ( 25 m M ) , which blocks formin - proﬁlin binding involved in formin - dependent F - actin assembly 16 , inhibited O - shrink and promoted stay fusion ( Fig . 2g ) . In contrast , nocodazole , a microtubule assembly blocker , had no effects ( n ¼ 9 cells , 10 m M ) . These results suggest that F - actin assembly pathways are involved in mediating O - proﬁle merging . Interestingly , whole - cell dialysis of phalloidin – ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ; 1 . 3 m M , 2 - 3 min ) , which stabilizes F - actin , inhibited O - shrink fusion , promoted stay fusion ( Supplementary Fig . 3a , b ) , but did not affect the Lifeact intensity at the cell bottom ( Supplementary Fig . 3c , d ) . These results suggest that dynamic F - actin polymerization is needed to mediate O - proﬁle merging . 2 1 F 488 F 488 2 1 F 488 2 1 F 488 3 1 F 647 3 1 F 647 2 1 F 647 500 300 W H ( n m ) 3 1 F 647 3 1 F 647 400 200 W H ( n m ) 400 200 Stay Close W H ( n m ) 500 300 W H ( n m ) 500 300 W H ( n m ) 2 s 5 s Close fusion 5 s Stay fusion Cm ICa 200 fF 2 s 300 pA a b e 2 1 F 488 3 1 2 s g A647 f 500 nm Objective ICaCm Cell d 500 nm 500 nm 500 nm h A488 i Ca 2 + dialysis 80 0 % o f e v en t s 80 0 % o f e v en t s Train 2Hz Stay Close c Ω - shrink fusion Ω - shrink fusion Spot 1 : Ω - shrink fusion Spot 2 : Ω - shrink fusion Ω - shrink Stay Close Ω - shrink 1 2 Figure 1 | Train 2Hz induces three fusion forms with X - shrink as the dominant form in control chromafﬁn cells .

ATP g S also slowed down the F 647 decay t during O - shrink fusion ( Fig . 2d and Supplementary Fig . 4b ) . Thus , ATP hydrolysis is needed to merge O - proﬁles . Although the O - shrink fusion frequency is inversely related to ICa 11 , inhibition of O - shrink by actin - related drugs is not due to ICa changes for two reasons . First , these drugs did not affect ICa ( Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . Second , Lat A or Cyto D inhibited O - shrink and promoted stay fusion induced by whole - cell calcium dialysis , a stimulus independent of ICa ( Supplementary Fig . 6 ) .

KO was achieved by breeding chromafﬁn cell - speciﬁc Cre mice , the PNMT Cre / þ mice 19 , with Actb LoxP / LoxP mice 20 and subsequently breeding PNMT Cre / þ ; Actb LoxP / þ mice with PNMT Cre / þ ; Actb LoxP / þ mice to generate PNMT Cre / Cre ; Actb LoxP / LoxP mice ( Actb (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice ; Supplementary Fig . 7 ) . Immunostaining of Cre and b - actin conﬁrmed expression of Cre - recombinase and the absence of b - actin in Actb (cid:2) / (cid:2) mouse chromafﬁn cells ( Fig . 3a ) . In cultured wild - type ( WT ) or Actb LoxP / LoxP mouse chromaf - ﬁn cells ( control ) , Train 2Hz induced an ICa of 416 ± 55 pA and a capacitance jump ( n ¼ 10 cells ; Supplementary Fig . 8a ) . Fusion events included O - shrink fusion ( 80 ± 5 % ) , stay fusion ( 18 ± 5 % ) and close fusion ( 2 ± 1 % ) as recorded at the confocal A647 strong / A488 weak setting ( Supplementary Fig . 8b – e ; n ¼ 10 cells , total fusion spots : 80 ) . Similar percentages of O - shrink , stay and close fusion were induced by whole - cell dialysis of calcium ( 1 . 5 m M ) into the chromafﬁn cells ( Fig . 3b ) . These results were similar to those observed in control bovine chromafﬁn cells . We used calcium dialysis as stimulation for most mouse experiments , because calcium dialysis induced more fusion events . b - Actin KO reduced O - shrink from 77 % in control to 25 % and increased stay fusion from 20 to 74 % , but did not affect close fusion during calcium dialysis ( Fig . 3b ) . Similar reduction of O - shrink fusion and increase of stay fusion were obtained during Train 2Hz in Actb (cid:2) / (cid:2) mouse chromafﬁn cells ( Supplementary Fig . 8e ) . Rescue of KO by transfecting WT b - actin attached with monomeric enhanced green ﬂuorescent protein ( b - Actin – mEGFP , for recognition of transfected cells ) to Actb (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells increased b - actin expression ( Fig . 3c ; n ¼ 3 transfections ) and rescued O - shrink fusion to the control level ( Fig . 3b ; n ¼ 7 cells ) . Thus , b - actin is involved in mediating O - proﬁle merging . Application of Lat A ( 3 m M ) in Actb (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells did not further reduce O - shrink fusion ( Fig . 3b ; n ¼ 7 cells ) , but signiﬁcantly reduced O - shrink fusion in WT cells ( Fig . 3b ; n ¼ 10 cells ) , conﬁrming that Lat A reduces O - shrink fusion by blocking F - actin . These results consolidated our conclusion that actin is involved in mediating O - shrink fusion . F - actin is more concentrated near the plasma membrane . Recent studies show that in cells containing B 1 – 5 m m granules , F - actin coats the fusing O - proﬁle with an onset at several seconds after fusion , which is thought to either compress or hold the O - proﬁle 5 – 10 . Here we determined whether F - actin coats and shrinks the fusing O - proﬁle in chromafﬁn cells . STED scanning at the microscopic XY plane above the cell bottom ( 4 2 m m ) revealed that dense Lifeact co - localized with or near the overexpressed phospholipase C delta PH domain tagged with mPapaya ( PH – mPapaya ) , which labels PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( PIP 2 ) , a lipid localized at the plasma membrane ( Fig . 4a ) 21 . STED scanning at the microscopic XZ plane ( vertical to XY plane , parallel to microscopic Z axis ) at the cell bottom revealed that Lifeact closely adhered to the PH – mPapaya ( Fig . 4b ) , conﬁrming a dense cortical actin network observed near , but not far from , the plasma membrane ( see also Supplementary Fig . 9a , b for quantiﬁcation ) 22 – 24 . With this dense actin network , granules near the plasma membrane , including NPY – mCherry - containing granules , were more associated with the F - actin network than those far from the plasma membrane ( Fig . 4c ) , similar to a recent report with three - dimensional electron tomography 24 . We did not observe consistently actin rings surrounding NPY – EGFP - containing vesicles ( Fig . 4c ) . β - Actin β - Actin - mEGFP a c WT Actb – / – Actb – / – Actb – / – + β - Actin - mEGFP Actb – / – + β - Actin - mEGFP Actb – / – + Lat A b 80 0 % o f e v en t s 11 * * * * * * 10 7 10 7 * * * * * * * * * * * * Ctrl Ω - shrink Stay Close 2 μ m 10 μ m Cre Cre Lat A Actb – / – Figure 3 | b - Actin KO inhibits X - shrink fusion but promotes stay fusion .

However , the onset of F Lifeact increase was 1 . 9 ± 0 . 4 s ( n ¼ 15 ) later than the onset of F 647 decay that reﬂected O - proﬁle shrinking ( Supplementary Fig . 9c , d ) . F Lifeact increase started when F 647 decreased by 57 ± 5 % ( n ¼ 15 ; Supplementary Fig . 9c , d ) . This delayed F Lifeact increase suggests that F - actin movement or coating does not initiate O - proﬁle shrinking . More importantly , 59 % ( 22 out of 37 ) of O - shrink fusion events were not accompanied with F Lifeact increase ( Supplementary Fig . 9e , f ) . This lack of F Lifeact increase was not due to the lack of Lifeact expression , because ( 1 ) Lifeact was expressed nearby O - shrink events showing no F Lifeact increase ( for example , Supplementary Fig . 9e ) and ( 2 ) 15 out of 22 O - shrink events showing no F Lifeact increase were observed in cells containing other O - shrink fusion events with F Lifeact increase .

We do not know why F - actin moves into the shrinking O - proﬁle in some cases . It could be either a passive reﬁlling of the empty space or an active process . Further understanding of this phenomenon is beyond the scope of the present work , which aimed at understanding the mechanisms underlying O - shrink fusion . F - actin exerts mechanical forces to merge the X - proﬁle . F - actin increases the plasma membrane tension ( Tension pm ) 25 – 28 . Here we tested whether F - actin shrinks the O - proﬁle via an increase of Tension pm . We estimated Tension pm , the force needed to pull the surface by certain length ( force per unit length ) , using the micropipette aspiration technique . A negative pressure applied to a micropipette in contact with the plasma membrane drew the plasma membrane into the pipette to a length L ( Fig . 4d ) 29 . The normalized length , calculated as L divided by the pipette diameter D ( L / D ) , is inversely correlated with Young’s module , a membrane elasticity measurement that is correlated with Tension pm 29 . With a negative pressure of 500 Pa , the L / D value was B 2 times larger in the presence of Lat A than in control ( Fig . 4d , e ) , suggesting that Lat A reduces membrane stiffness and Tension pm in chromafﬁn cells . To determine whether reduction of Tension pm inhibits O - shrink fusion , we changed Tension pm with a commonly used method—increasing or reducing the bath solution osmolarity to reduce or increase Tension pm , respectively 25 , 28 . Consistent with reduced Tension pm , increasing osmolarity from 305 ( control ) to 650 mOsm ( hyper - osmotic solution ) reduced the cell volume , measured with atomic force microscopy ( AFM ; Fig . 4f , g ) . It also reduced the cell diameter , detected by confocal microscopy at the cell - centre with A647 in the bath ( Supplementary Fig . 10a ) . Consistent with enhanced Tension pm 25 , 28 , reducing the bath osmolarity from 305 to 164 mOsm ( hypo - osmotic solution ) increased the cell volume ( Fig . 4f , g ) and diameter ( Supplementary Fig . 10b ) , and increased Tension pm estimated with micropipette aspiration ( n ¼ 10 cells , not shown ) . Resembling actin blockers , the hyper - osmotic solution decreased O - shrink fusion induced by Train 2Hz from 68 to 23 % and increased the stay fusion from 29 to 75 % ( P o 0 . 001 ; Fig . 5a ) . Adding Lat A to a hyper - osmotic solution did not further reduce O - shrink or increase the stay fusion percentage ( Fig . 5a ) , suggesting that Lat A inhibited O - shrink fusion primarily by reducing Tension pm . Compared with control , the hypo - osmotic solution did not further increase the O - shrink fusion or decrease stay fusion ( Fig . 5b ) , probably because O - shrink fusion has already approached its maximal capacity ( B 70 % ) in control . However , in the presence of Lat A , applying the hypo - osmotic solution increased O - shrink fusion from 19 to 50 % ( P o 0 . 001 ; t - test ) , decreased stay fusion from 76 to 48 % ( P o 0 . 001 ; t - test , 18 cells ; Fig . 5b ) and did not affect ICa ( Supplementary Fig . 11 ) . This rescue of O - shrink fusion by a large extent ( Fig . 5b ) suggests that the increase in Tension pm by the hypo - osmotic solution counter - acts Lat A’s inhibitory effects on O - shrink fusion . In summary , Lat A reduced Tension pm ( Fig . 4d , e ) and O - shrink fusion percentage ( Fig . 2b ) . Reducing Tension pm by the hyper - osmotic solution mimicked Lat A’s effect in inhibiting O - shrink fusion and prevented Lat A from further inhibiting O - shrink fusion ( Fig . 5a ) . Conversely , enhancing Tension pm by the hypo - osmotic solution largely prevented Lat A from inhibiting O - shrink fusion ( Fig . 5b ) . These results suggest that Lat A inhibits O - shrink fusion by reducing Tension pm . In other words , F - actin mediates O - shrink fusion by providing sufﬁcient Tension pm . In Actb (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells , applying the hypo - osmotic solution ( 221 mOsm ) increased O - shrink fusion from 20 to 78 % ( P o 0 . 001 ; t - test ) and decreased stay fusion from 73 to 20 % ( P o 0 . 001 ; t - test , n ¼ 10 cells ; Fig . 5c ) . Applying the hypo - osmotic solution to WT mouse chromafﬁn cells did not increase the O - shrink fusion ( Fig . 5c ; n ¼ 8 cells ) . Thus , increasing Tension pm by hypo - osmotic solution rescued the inhibition of O - shrink fusion by b - actin KO , which further supports our suggestion that actin mediates O - shrink fusion by providing sufﬁcient Tension pm . How would sufﬁcient Tension pm shrink the O - proﬁle ? Given that blocking F - actin increased stay fusion and thus the number of O - proﬁles at the plasma membrane , there should be an F - actin - independent force that maintains the O - proﬁle from collapsing . With this O - proﬁle - maintaining force , Tension pm may pull the O - proﬁle membrane and thus shrink the O - proﬁle till merging of the O - proﬁle with the plasma membrane ( Fig . 5d ) . We can now update the O - exo - endocytosis model ( Fig . 1c ) , where calcium and dynamin mediate close fusion 11 , with the involvement of F - actin and Tension pm in O - shrink fusion ( Fig . 5e ) . F - actin blockers increase X - proﬁles at active zones . To deter - mine whether F - actin mediates O - proﬁle merging in synapses , we examined whether block of actin dynamics accumulates O - proﬁles in lamprey giant reticulospinal synapses , in which intermediates of the vesicle cycle can be clearly resolved using EM 30 , 31 . We microinjected giant axons with a mixture of Lat A and Cyto D or a modiﬁed proﬁlin – actin protein with a zero - length covalent cross - link between proﬁlin and actin , termed PxA 32 – 34 . PxA structually resembles endogeneous proﬁlin – actin , but is non - dissociable between proﬁlin and actin , and thus inhibits formin - dependent F - actin assembly 32 – 34 . Concentrations of the actin - directed compounds in microinjection pipette were 60 m M per 33 m M for Lat A / Cyto D and 5 mg ml (cid:2) 1 for PxA , but were diluted B 10 – 20 times in the studied regions of axons following microinjections ( Supplementary Fig . 12a ) . The active zone morphology ( Supplementary Fig . 12b – e and Fig . 6a , b ) and the action potential progagation along the axon ( Supplementary Fig . 12f ) were apparently normal after microinjection . Synapses were stimulated with action potentials at 5 Hz for 20 – 30 min , then ﬁxed and embedded for EM in serial ultrathin sections 30 , 31 . Vesicle clusters were observed at active zones and examined in serial ultrathin sections ( Fig . 6a – f and Supplementary Fig . 12b – d ) . O - proﬁles were identiﬁed as having a pore smaller than or equal to its width ( Fig . 6c - e ) . O - proﬁles were rarely observed in control synapses or synapses microinjected with bovine proﬁlin I ( Fig . 6c , g ) , but were much more frequently observed at the active zones of the synapses microinjected with Lat A / Cyto D ( Fig . 6d , g ) or PxA ( Fig . 6e , g ) . Lat A / Cyto D or PxA did not signiﬁcantly affect the number of vesicles at the active zone membrane ( Supplementary Fig . 12b – e ) . Unlike clathrin - coated O - proﬁles observed at the periactive zone ( Fig . 6f ) 30 , 31 , O - proﬁles at the active zone were not coated with the clathrin lattice ( Fig . 6c - e ) , suggesting that they are not generated via clathrin - mediated endocytosis . Dimension of most of O - proﬁles were similar to vesicles , but some appeared to be larger or smaller ( for example , Fig . 6d , e and Supplementary Fig . 12b – d ) , consistent with stay fusion displaying variations of O - proﬁle size in chromaﬁn cells ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) 11 . The O - proﬁles accumulated at the active zone are unlikely to be due to block of the fusion pore closure , because in chromafﬁn cells actin blockers did not block close fusion induced by Train 2Hz ( Fig . 2 ) or a 1 s depolarization ( n ¼ 8 cells , 3 m M Lat A , not NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms12604 ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | 7 : 12604 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms12604 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications 7 shown ) , the latter of which induced more close fusion events 11 . Analogous to results observed in chromafﬁn cells , results observed in lamprey axons ( Fig . 6 ) suggest that F - actin promotes O - proﬁle merging at active zones . This suggestion was further supported by the following two sets of control experiments . First , post - embedding immunoEM with a monoclonal actin antibody 12 , 19 revealed an accumulation of immunogold particles around dense projections of the active zone in giant synapses ( Fig . 6h – j and Supplementary Fig . 13a – d ) 35 . The number of gold particles near the presynaptic plasma membrane ( o 100 nm ) of the active zone ( 95 . 7 ± 15 . 4 m m (cid:2) 2 ; n ¼ 20 synapses ) was signiﬁcantly higher than that ( the particles near the presynaptic plasma membrane ) 4 300 nm outside the active zone ( PM outside active zone , 16 . 9 ± 5 . 0 m m (cid:2) 2 ; n ¼ 20 synapses , P o 0 . 001 ; Fig . 6j and also see Supplementary Fig . 13a – d for illustrations ) . It was also signiﬁcantly higher than in the synaptic vesicle reserve pool area , 200 nm inside the active zone membrane ( 43 . 5 ± 5 . 0 m m (cid:2) 2 ; n ¼ 17 synapses , P ¼ 0 . 0048 ; Fig . 6h – j ) . Thus , actin network is denser near the active zone membrane . The dense actin network at the active zone membrane was further conﬁrmed by confocal microscopy of F - actin labelled with phalloidin conjugated with Alexa Flour 488 ( phalloidin - Alexa 488 ) injected into the axon ( Supplementary Fig . 14a ) . Microinjected phalloidin - Alexa 488 accumulated in spots of ﬂuorescence that labelled active and periactive zones 36 ( see also Supplementary Fig . 14a ) . Second , to determine whether Lat A and Cyto D reduced F - actin , we injected Lat A / Cyto D plus Texas Red and 10 – 15 min later injected phalloidin - Alexa 488 into the axon at B 800 m m away . Next , we measured phalloidin - Alexa 488 ﬂuorescence punta at B 300 – 500 m m away from the Lat A / Cyto D injection site ( Supplementary Fig . 14b , c ) .

In summary , actin was localized in the active zone membrane ( Fig . 6h – j and Supplementary Figs 13 and 14 ) . F - actin directed compounds reduced F - actin ( Supplementary Fig . 14 ) in the axon and caused accumulation of O - proﬁles at the active zone membrane ( Fig . 6 ) without damaging the morphology and the action potential propagation of the axon ( Supplementary Figs 12 and 13 ) . These results suggest that F - actin is involved in mediating O - proﬁle merging at the neuronal nerve terminal . Discussion The present work establishes a molecular and biophysical model accounting for O - proﬁle merging , which deﬁnes the modes of exocytosis and endocytosis . We found that dynamic F - actin assembly is necessary for O - proﬁle merging in chromafﬁn cells ( Figs 1 – 3 ) . F - actin imaging and Tension pm measurements and manipulations suggest that F - actin provides sufﬁcient Tension pm to facilitate O - proﬁle shrinking and thus to merge the O - proﬁle with the plasma membrane ( Figs 4 and 5 ) . Not only F - actin but also the F - actin assembly pathway such as N - WASP , formin ( Figs 2 and 6 ) and ATP hydrolysis ( Fig . 2 ) may participate in O - proﬁle merging . The highly abundant cytoskeletal actin and its assembly pathway , the essential energy - providing molecule ATP and cell membrane tension controlled by many factors may thus regulate exo - and endocytosis in physiological and pathological conditions by controlling O - proﬁle merging . Our ﬁndings , obtained from bovine and mouse chromafﬁn cells containing large vesicles , may apply to many other cells containing similarly large dense - core vesicles . They may apply to large vesicles distributed widely in glial cells , nerve terminals , neuronal dendrites and cell bodies that secrete dopamine , peptides or hormones ( for example , oxytocin and vasopressin ) or deliver transmembrane receptors to dendrites and dendritic spines crucial for our brain’s physiological functions and disorders 2 , 37 . Our ﬁnding that F - actin mediates O - proﬁle merging is likely to apply to small synaptic vesicles , because ( 1 ) actin blockers accumulate O - proﬁles at lamprey active zones ( Fig . 6 ) and ( 2 ) neuroendocrine chromafﬁn cells and nerve terminals are similar in the molecular machineries of exo - and endocytosis 1 , 2 , 38 – 40 . We acknowledge that the evidence obtained with EM at lamprey synapses was not as direct as that in live chromafﬁn cells where O - proﬁle merging could be observed directly . The ﬁnal resolution at live synapses , although technically not available now , will eventually be needed to establish our conclusion for synapses . O - proﬁle merging is via shrinking of O - proﬁle in chromafﬁn cells 11 , but is generally believed to be via pore dilation ( full - collapse fusion ) at synapses 41 – 43 . One may wonder how F - actin mediates these two different behaviours . O - shrink fusion was revealed in live cells with STED imaging at B 90 nm resolution , which could not exclude pore dilation below 90 nm 11 , whereas pore dilation was suggested based on EM 41 – 43 but has not been visualized and proved in any live cell . O - proﬁle shrinking and pore dilation may therefore be reconciled with a scenario , in which O - proﬁle membrane was pulled into the plasma membrane by Tension pm , resulting in continuous O - proﬁle shrinking until the height of the O - proﬁle is shorter than the pore diameter ( Fig . 5d , grey drawing ) . Under this condition , further pulling of the O - proﬁle membrane into the plasma membrane by Tension pm results in a collapse - like structure , turning into a full - collapse fusion ( Fig . 5d ) . This model requires an actin - independent mechanism to hold the pore from collapse , which must exist because F - actin inhibition increased stay fusion , the persistent presence of fusion - generated O - proﬁles ( Figs 2 and 3 ) . The pore size may determine when the merging process changes from shrinking to collapse . It would be of great interest to test this model by visualizing the fusion pore during shrinking of the O - proﬁle in the future . Although inhibition of F - actin reduced O - shrink , but increased stay fusion , close fusion did not increase ( Figs 2 and 3 ) . This observation suggests that conversion from stay to O - proﬁle closure is not automatic but requires a trigger . We recently found that calcium inﬂux triggered close fusion—large calcium inﬂux during a 1 s depolarization induce close fusion in 4 80 % of fusion events and nearly no O - shrink fusion 11 . Thus , large calcium inﬂux is needed to convert stay to close fusion . This may explain why with relatively low calcium inﬂux during Train 2Hz , increase of stay fusion in the presence of F - actin blockers did not signiﬁcantly increase close fusion . Taken together , the extent of calcium inﬂux determines whether the fusing O - proﬁle closes or not ( Fig . 5e ) . If the O - proﬁle does not close , sufﬁcient Tension pm provided by F - actin may mediate O - shrink fusion ( Fig . 5e ) . If Tension pm is insufﬁcient , O - proﬁle stays at the plasma membrane , resulting in the stay fusion ( Fig . 5e ) . With large calcium inﬂux , close fusion occurs much more often than O - shrink fusion 11 . This might be in part due to inhibition of O - shrink fusion by strong calcium inﬂux . Consistent with this possibility , calcium inﬂux facilitates F - actin disassembly 44 , which may result in reduction of O - shrink fusion ( Fig . 2 ) . It would be of great interest to prove ( or disapprove ) this possibility with experimental evidence in the future . A large number of previous studies suggest that actin may play several possibly overlapping roles in the fusion process , including serving as a fusion barrier or providing a scaffold for anchoring secretory vesicles , a track to deliver secretory vesicles to the fusion site , regulation of vesicle docking and priming , regulation of the fusion pore , regulation of membrane merging after fusion and endocytosis ( reviewed in ref . 45 ) . As discussed below , the present work suggests a new mechanism of F - actin—mediating O - proﬁle shrinking and merging by providing sufﬁcient Tension pm . In Xenopus oocytes containing cortical granules 5 , human endothelial cells containing Weibel – Palade bodies , lacrimal epithelial acinar cells containing zymogen granules 6 , parotid or pancreatic acinar cells containing zymogen granules 7 , 8 and type II pneumocytes containing lamellar body 9 , vesicle fusion is followed by F - actin coating of the fusing vesicle ( reviewed in ref . 10 ) . Such an F - actin coating has been suggested to mediate two seemingly opposite functions : to compress the fusing O - proﬁle and thus to expel the vesicular content , or to hold the O - proﬁle from merging into the plasma membrane . However , these results were obtained from vesicles ( B 1 – 5 m m in diameter ) , which are much larger than those in neuroendocrine chromafﬁn cells ( B 300 nm ) and neurons ( B 20 – 80 nm ) , and take much longer time , in the order of tens of seconds to tens of minutes , to merge the O - proﬁle and expel vesicular contents . These substantial differences might explain why F - actin recruitment to the fusing vesicle is not the main mechanism to shrink the O - proﬁle in chromafﬁn cells ( Supplementary Fig . 9 ) . Instead , F - actin provides sufﬁcient Tension pm ( Figs 4 and 5 ) to mediate rapid O - proﬁle merging in hundreds of milliseconds in chromafﬁn cells ( Figs 2 and 3 ) . It is possible that this mechanism may also contribute to mediate O - proﬁle merging in cells containing large 1 – 5 m m vesicles , given that Tension pm has not been considered for large vesicle fusion in previous studies .

It was suggested that F - actin may squeeze the fusing O - proﬁle to speed up vesicular content release 49 . Our results suggest that the force to expel vesicular contents may be from Tension pm provided by F - actin , but not from active F - actin coating of the fusing O - proﬁle as observed during extremely slow release from very large vesicles 10 . In addition to facilitating content release , F - actin may promote dispersion of vesicular membrane proteins by promoting O - proﬁle shrinking , because a stabilized O - proﬁle retains vesicular membrane protein VAMP2 ( ref . 11 ) . A previous study observed that actin - directed compounds increase the quantal size ( from amperometric measurements ) and reduce the capacitance variance 48 , 50 in chromafﬁn cells . This observation led to the suggestion that actin stabilizes O - proﬁles in chromafﬁn cells containing B 300 nm vesicles 50 . However , this suggestion is interpreted from the measurements of quantal size ( from amperometric measurements ) and capacitance variance , which could not estimate a pore beyond B 5 nm 51 , 52 nor predict O - proﬁle merging . By direct measurements of O - proﬁle merging , we found that F - actin mediates O - proﬁle merging . We therefore suggest not to interpret O - proﬁle merging based on indirect amperometric or capacitance measurements . Although fusion pore opening is well known to overcome a signiﬁcant energy barrier 4 , once the pore is opened , the O - proﬁle is generally considered an unstable fusion intermediate that rapidly and passively merges with the plasma membrane without consuming energy in endocrine cells and neurons . This view appears to be incorrect , as we found that ATP hydrolysis and dynamic actin polymerization are needed to merge the O - proﬁle . The fusion - generated O - proﬁle is actually a stable structure in the absence of ATP hydrolysis ( Fig . 2 ) . Given that O - proﬁle merging takes place in all secretory cells 1 , 2 , O - proﬁle merging might be an energy - consuming step previously unrecognized . As vesicle exo - and endocytosis consume most ATP molecules in nerve terminals 53 , ATP consumption in O - proﬁle merging is a factor worth of consideration in low metabolic states with low ATP levels , mitochondria dysfunctions in various diseases ( for example , Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease ) that reduce ATP 54 and in diseases that affect F - actin or F - actin assembly pathways 55 . Methods Primary bovine chromafﬁn cell culture . Bovine chromafﬁn cells were prepared as described previously 11 . Brieﬂy , fresh adrenal glands were obtained from a local slaughterhouse on the day of culture . After excess fat was trimmed off the glands ( two were used per culture ) , glands were then perfused with cold 1 (cid:3) Lock’s buffer containing ( in mM ) : NaCl , 145 ; KCl , 5 . 4 ; Na 2 HPO 4 , 2 . 2 ; NaH 2 PO 4 , 0 . 9 ; glucose , 5 . 6 ; and HEPES , 10 pH 7 . 3 , to remove any residual blood . Each gland was then injected through the portal vein with B 2ml of ﬁltered Lock’s buffer containing collagenase P ( 1 . 5mgml (cid:2) 1 , Roche ) , trypsin inhibitor ( 0 . 325mgml (cid:2) 1 , Sigma ) and BSA ( 5mgml (cid:2) 1 , Sigma ) , and incubated at 37 (cid:2) C for 20min in a water bath . The glands were then cut open longitudinally , to expose the digested medulla . The medulla were carefully removed , minced in Lock’s buffer and ﬁltered through a nylon mesh . The ﬁltrate was centrifuged at 500r . p . m . for 4 – 5min , to obtain the cell pellet . The supernatant was then removed and the pellets resuspended in Lock’s buffer . The process was repeated one to two times until the supernatant was clear . Final cell pellet was resuspended in pre - warmed DMEM low glucose medium ( Gibco ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( Gibco ) and plated onto poly - D - lysine and laminin I - coated 25mm - diameter glass coverslips ( Neuvitro Corp . , USA ) . The plated cells were incubated at 37 (cid:2) C , 8 % humidiﬁed CO 2 and used within 4 days after culturing . In some experiments , cells were transfected with 2 m g of Lifeact - tagGFP2 ( Ibidi , Germany ) by electroporation using a basic neuron nucleofector kit ( Lonza , Program O - 005 ) according to the manufacturer’s instruction . Electrophysiology . Whole - cell voltage - clamp and capacitance recordings were performed with an EPC - 10 ampliﬁer together with the lock - in software ( PULSE , HEKA , Lambrecht , Germany ) 56 . All experiments were carried out at room temperature ( 21 (cid:2) C (cid:2) 24 (cid:2) C ) with the cells immersed in bathing solution containing ( in mM ) : 125 NaCl , 10 glucose , 10 HEPES , 5 CaCl 2 , 1 MgCl 2 , 4 . 5 KCl , 0 . 001 tetrodotoxin and 20 tetraethylammonium ion , pH 7 . 3 . The osmolarity of the bath solution was 305 – 310mOsm . In some experiments , we increased the osmolarity to 640 – 650mOsm by adding 295mM sucrose to the bath solution . In some experiments , we decreased the osmolarity to 160 – 221mOsm by reducing NaCl to 55 – 70mM . The pipette ( 3 – 6M O ) solution contained ( in mM ) : 130 glutamate , 0 . 5 EGTA , 12 NaCl , 30 HEPES , 1 MgCl 2 , 2 ATP and 0 . 5 GTP pH 7 . 2 adjusted with CsOH . The osmolarity was B 308mOsm . In some experiments , ATP ( 2mM ) in the pipette solution was replaced with a non - hydrolysable ATP g S ( 2mM , Sigma ) and MgCl 2 was raised to 3mM to facilitate endogenous ATP turnover 57 . For intracellular Ca 2 þ dialysis experiments , the pipette solution contained ( in mM ) : 110 glutamate , 10 EGTA , 12 NaCl , 30 HEPES , 1 MgCl 2 , 2 ATP 0 . 5 GTP and 9 CaCl 2 pH 7 . 2 adjusted with CsOH . The free Ca 2 þ concentration was B 1 . 5 m M , which was calculated based on the Max - Chelator programme ( Stanford University , Stanford , CA ) , in which the calcium dissociation constant of EGTA is 0 . 15 m M 58 , 59 . The holding potential was (cid:2) 80mV . For Train 2Hz stimulation , a Train of 50ms depolarization from (cid:2) 80 to þ 10mV was given at 2Hz ; each 50ms depolarization was preceded by a 50ms pre - pulse from (cid:2) 80 to þ 120mV , to facilitate Ca 2 þ channel current 60 – 62 . Cell membrane capacitance was simultaneously recorded 15s before , during and 30s after depolarization . The sample interval for current recordings was 50 m s . The frequency of the sinusoidal stimulus was 1 , 000 – 1 , 500Hz with a peak - to - peak voltage r 50mV . Confocal imaging . Alexa 647 ( A647 ; 20 – 30 m M in bathing solution , Invitrogen ) and Alexa 488 dyes ( A488 ; 20 – 30 m M in bathing solution , Invitrogen ) were excited by a solid - state 638nm ( 30mW output ) and 488nm lasers ( 20mW output ) with an inverted confocal microscope ( TCS SP8 , Leica , Germany ; original magniﬁcation , (cid:3) 63 / 1 . 40 oil objective ) . Unless mentioned otherwise , the 638nm laser was set at 20 – 25 % of the maximum power and the 488nm laser was set at 0 . 5 – 2 % of the maximum power . A647 ﬂuorescence was collected with a photomultiplier at 639 – 767nm , whereas A488 was collected with a hybrid GaAsP spectral detector at 489 – 596nm . For time - lapse A647 / A488 imaging , images were collected with 40ms inter - frame interval at 45 – 70nm per pixel in an imaging area of B 160 – 320 m m 2 . In some experiments , cells were pre - treated with 3 m M latrunculin A ( Enzo Life Sciences ) , 4 m M Cyto D ( Enzo Life Sciences ) , wiskostatin ( 10 m M , Tocris Bioscience ) and SMIFH2 ( 25 m M , Tocris Bioscience ) for 20min in the bath solution , or whole - cell dialysis of phalloidin – FITC ( 1 . 3 m M , Invitrogen ) for 2 – 3min before imaging . STED imaging . The inverted STED microscopes used in this study ( TCS SP5 STED , TCS SP8 STED 3X , Leica ) have a resolution of B 60 – 90nm . A488 ( 60 m M ) was excited with an Argon laser at 488nm at 20 % of the maximum power ( maximum power : 25mW ) and depleted with a continuous wave ﬁbre laser at 592nm using the maximum power ( 1 . 5W ) . The ﬂuorescence was acquired by GaAsP hybrid detection system at 498 – 580nm . At 20 % of the maximum power , 488nm laser caused A488 bleaching after pore closure with a time course similar to that of A647 under the confocal setting 11 . Lifeact ( TagGFP2 ) was excited by a tunable white light laser at 470nm ( 7 % of maximum power ) with the STED depletion laser at 592nm ( 25 % of the maximum power ) and its ﬂuorescence at 480 – 560nm was collected using time - gated detection ( 1 . 5 – 6 . 5ns ) . mCherry was excited by the tunable white light laser at 570nm ( 6 % of maximum power ) with the STED depletion laser at 660nm ( 60 % of the maximum power ) and its ﬂuorescence between 575 and 650nm was collected using time - gated detection ( 0 . 5 – 6 . 5ns ) . PH – mPapaya was excited by the tunable white light laser at 530nm ( 14 % of the maximum power ) with the STED depletion laser at 660nm ( 10 % of the maximum power ) and its ﬂuorescence between 541 and 620nm was collected using time - gated detection ( 1 . 5 – 6 . 5ns ) . When NPY – mCherry or PH – mPapaya and Lifeact ( TagGFP2 ) were imaged at the STED microscope , NPY – mCherry ( or PH – mPapaya ) was imaged ﬁrst , to avoid bleaching of mCherry or mPapaya ﬂuorescence by the 592nm STED depletion laser . For XZ scanning , we used 70 – 80 % of STED depletion laser power in the Z - direction to improve the z axis resolution . Image analysis . A647 or A488 spots ( O - proﬁles ﬁlled with A647 or A488 ) were identiﬁed during and o 3 s after the end of depolarization . The spot ﬂuorescence intensity was measured using the LAS AF Life analysis tool or Image J and plotted using Igor Pro 6 . 12 . The baseline ﬂuorescence value for each spot was normalized to 1 . The representative image frames shown below the ﬂuorescence traces were either unaveraged or averaged up to 20 frames as indicated in the ﬁgure legends . W H was measured from intensity proﬁles of two to four lines across the spot centre at 45 o or 90 o apart 11 . Although fusion modes ( O - shrink fusion , stay and close fusion ) were identiﬁed mostly at the cell - bottom confocal A647 / A488 setting ( strong / weak excitation ) , we sometimes identiﬁed the fusion modes with a single dye excited strongly , as described in detail in ref . 11 . A single dye was used for Actb (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells overexpressed with b - Actin – mEGFP ( Fig . 3b ) , for cells dialysed with NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms12604 ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | 7 : 12604 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms12604 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications 11 phalloidin – FITC ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) and for STED imaging above the cell bottom ( Supplementary Fig . 1c ; 592nm laser for depletion ) . Generation of chromafﬁn cell - speciﬁc b - actin KO mice . Global KO of b - actin is embryonically lethal 63 , 64 . Accordingly , we used a chromafﬁn cell - speciﬁc Cre mouse , the PNMT Cre / þ mouse 19 , to knock out b - actin tissue speciﬁcally in chromafﬁn cells . We bred the 129 / SvImJ PNMT Cre / þ mice with C57BL / 6 Actb LoxPLloxP mice ( Actb gene encodes b - actin ) 20 and subsequently bred PNMT Cre / þ ; Actb LoxP / þ mice with PNMT Cre / þ ; Actb LoxP / þ mice to generate PNMT Cre / Cre ; Actb LoxP / LoxP mice ( Actb (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice ) . Mouse genotypes were determined by PCR . Mouse chromafﬁn cell culture . Animal care and use were carried out in accordance with NIH guidelines and approved by NINDS / NIDCD / NCCIH Animal Care and Use Committee in NIH . Five to 10 weeks old female or male mouse adrenal glands were used for experiments to obtain chromafﬁn cells as described previously 65 with some modiﬁcation . Brieﬂy , adrenal glands were removed from mice ( two per culture ) and bathed in a dissociation buffer containing ( in mM ) : 80 Na - glutamate , 55 NaCl , 6 KCl , 1 MgCl 2 , 10 HEPES and 10 D - glucose pH 7 adjusted with NaOH . Under a dissecting microscope , adrenal cortex was carefully removed to expose the medulla . The medulla was ﬁrst digested in the dissociation buffering containing papain ( 30Uml (cid:2) 1 , Sigma ) , BSA ( 0 . 5mgml (cid:2) 1 , Sigma ) and dithiothreitol ( 0 . 1mM , Sigma ) at 37 (cid:2) C for 8min and further digested in the dissociation buffer containing collagenase F ( 3Uml (cid:2) 1 , Sigma ) and CaCl 2 ( 0 . 1mM ) at 37 (cid:2) C . The digested medulla was carefully resuspended in DMEM medium ( Invitrogen ) containing 10 % fetal bovine serum ( Gibco ) and centrifuged at 500r . p . m . for 3min . For rescue experiments , Actb (cid:2) / (cid:2) cell pellet was transfected with b - Actin – mEGFP ( 2 m g , Addgene ) using a basic neuron nucleofector kit ( Lonza , Program O - 005 ) . For most other experiments , cell pellet was resuspended in the fresh pre - warmed DMEM and plated onto poly - D - lysine and laminin I - coated 25mm - diameter glass coverslips ( Neuvitro Corp . ) . Cells were incubated at 37 (cid:2) C with 8 % CO 2 for at least 48h before using for imaging or immunocytochemistry . For immunocytochemistry , cultured cells were brieﬂy washed with 1 (cid:3) PBS and ﬁxed with 4 % paraformaldehyde ( Electron Microscopy Sciences , USA ) in PBS for 20min . Cells were permeabilized with 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 for 10min , blocked with 5 % goat serum before incubation with mouse anti - b - actin ( 1 / 500 , Abcam ) and rabbit anti - Cre - recombinase antibodies ( 1 / 250 , Abcam ) in PBS containing 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 and 1 % BSA at 4 (cid:2) C overnight . After washing with PBS , cells were incubated with Atto - 488 - and Alexa - 647 - conjugated secondary antibodies ( 1 / 400 ) in PBS containing 1 % BSA , washed with PBS and mounted . Images were examined by Zeiss LSM 510 meta confocal microscope . Same image settings were applied to both control ( WT or Actb LoxP / LoxP ) and b - actin KO mice chromafﬁn cells . Micropipette aspiration measurements . A home - built micropipette aspiration system with a graduated manometer was used for application of controlled suction pressure onto living cells . Glass micropipettes with an inner diameter of 2 – 3 m m were ﬁlled with 0 . 2 % BSA in 1 (cid:3) PBS , to allow smooth movement of the cell membrane inside the pipette . Negative pressure in the micropipette tip was gen - erated by aspirating water from the manometer reservoir and increased gradually in 200Pa increments . Nikon Advanced Modulation Contrast optics mounted on a Nikon Ti - S microscope and CoolSnap MYOCCD camera ( Photometrics , Tucson , AZ ) were used to acquire live - cell bright - ﬁeld images . Image J ( http : / / rsb . info . nih . gov / ij / ) software was used to manually measure the pipette diameters and plasma membrane projection length within the pipette . Atomic force microscopy . AFM imaging was performed on a BioScope Catalyst II AFM with a Nanoscope V controller ( Bruker , CA ) . A polystyrene microsphere with known diameter of 9 . 6 m m ( Interfacial Dynamics Corp . , Portland , OR , USA ) was glued onto a tipless cantilever ( MLCTO10 - D , Bruker ) whose spring constant is calibrated by the standard thermal ﬂuctuation method . The cell volume was obtained through the force volume mode in a scan range of 40 (cid:3) 40 m m with 64 (cid:3) 64 pixels . The volume of the same cell was measured in control , in a hyper - osmotic solution and in a hypo - osmotic solution under the same probe and parameter setting for direct comparison . The resulting topographic images were exported to ImageJ ( version 1 . 49d , NIH , Bethesda , MD ) for three - dimensional visualization and cell - shape computation , and for ﬁnal volume ratio statistics and plotting in Microsoft Excel ( version 14 , Richmond , WA ) . Data collection and statistical analysis in chromafﬁn cells . All data at the whole - cell conﬁguration were collected within 3min after whole - cell break - in , which minimized whole - cell rundown of endocytosis 11 , 66 . All experiments in chromafﬁn cells were carried out from at least three independent cultures . Unpaired or paired Student’s t - test ( two - tailed ) was used for the statistical analysis . The data were expressed as mean ± s . e . m . or mean þ s . e . m . Lamprey synapse and EM . Animal care and use were carried out in accordance with Karolinska Institutet guidelines and approved by the Swedish Board of Agriculture . Dissection of the trunk region of the lamprey spinal cord , micro - injection procedures , stimulation and ﬁxation were performed as described before 67 . Giant axons were stimulated at 5Hz for 20 – 30min using an extracellular electrode . Action potentials in giant axons were monitored with an extracellular suction electrode placed at the caudal part of the preparation ( Supplementary Fig . 12f ) . The microinjection pipettes contained latrunculin A ( 60 m M ) and Cyto D ( 33 m M ) , phalloidin - Alexa Flour 488 ( 1 , 200U m l (cid:2) 1 ; Invitrogen ) , PxA ( 5mgml (cid:2) 1 ) and bovine proﬁlin I ( 5mgml (cid:2) 1 ) in a buffer solution containing 10mM HEPES ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 250mMK þ acetate and 0 . 5 % dimethyl sulfoxide . Covalently cross - linked PxA was prepared as described previously 33 . Compounds were diluted in Texas Red ( 3 , 000Mw , Molecular Probes ) and monitored with a charge - coupled device camera ( Princeton Instruments ) connected to a ﬂuorescence microscope and a Nikon D - eclipse C1 confocal microscope using a (cid:3) 10 air or (cid:3) 40 water - immersion objective ( numerical aperture 0 . 80 ) . Synapses were studied for EM at distances larger than 100 m m from the site of microinjections where the Texas Red ﬂuorescence was 10 – 20 times lower than at the site of microinjection ( Supplementary Fig . 12a ) . We therefore estimated that the concentration of Lat A and Cyto D at the site of EM examination was o 6 and 3 . 3 m M , respectively . Spinal cords were ﬁxed during stimulation with 3 % glutaraldehyde , 0 . 5 % paraformaldehyde in 0 . 1M cacodylate buffer ( pH 7 . 4 ) containing 4 % tannic acid for 1h , followed by the same ﬁxative without tannic acid for 3h . After post ﬁxation in 1 % osmium tetroxide for 1h and dehydration in alcohol , the specimens were embedded in Durcupan ACM ( Fluka ) . Serial ultrathin sections were cut with a diamond knife ( Diatome ) and viewed at 80kV in a Tecnai 12 electron microscope ( FEI ) . Effects of microinjections were analyzed in synapses cut in serial ultrathin sections . Samples were blinded before imaging and analysis . All described effects were reproduced in at least two independent preparations in which one to six axons were microinjected . Quantiﬁcations of fusion intermediates and synaptic vesicles at the active zone were done from serial sections of ﬁve synapses . Signiﬁcances and P - values were calculated using one - way analysis of variance followed by Holm – Sˇı´da´k’s multiple comparisons test ( GraphPad Prism 6 ) . For immunogold labelling experiments , non - stimulated lamprey spinal cords were dissected , ﬁxed in 3 % paraformaldehyde and 0 . 5 % glutaraldehyde in 0 . 1M cacodylate buffer ( pH 7 . 4 ) containing 4 % tannic acid for 1h at 4 (cid:2) C , followed by the same ﬁxative without tannic acid for 3h . Specimens were stained en bloc with 2 % uranyl acetate , dehydrated in graded ethanol series and embedded at (cid:2) 25 (cid:2) C in LR Gold resin ( Fluka ) . Serial ultrathin sections were collected on nickel mesh grids and incubated overnight at 4 (cid:2) C with primary monoclonal actin antibodies ( b - actin Antibody ( C4 ) : sc - 47778 ; Santa Cruz Biotech ) diluted 1 : 100 in Tris - PBS ( pH 7 . 4 ) containing 1 % human serum albumin and 5 % BSA . Secondary antibodies conjugated to 5nm colloidal gold ( AuroProbe EM GAM G5 : RPN 424 ; Amersham Biosciences ) were used at a dilution of 1 : 25 . Gold particles were enhanced using the IntenSE Silver enhancement kit ( RPN 492 ; Amersham Biosciences ) following manufacturer’s instructions . Sections were counterstained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate , and examined in a Tecnai 12 electron microscope ( FEI ) . Experiments where primary antibodies were omitted did not produce any speciﬁc labelling . The number of particles was quantiﬁed in selected regions ( see Supplementary Fig . 13a ) and the density of gold particles per m m 2 was calculated . Synapse was deﬁned as a region containing synaptic vesicles clustered at dense projections at the presynaptic membrane , the active zone . Data availability .
