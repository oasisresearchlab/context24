The main objective was to determine the SARS - CoV - 2 seroprevalence among school staff in Vancouver public schools . Design Cumulative incident COVID - 19 cases among all students and school staff based on public health data , with an embedded cross - sectional serosurvey among a school staff sample that was compared to period , age , sex and geographical location - weighted data from blood donors . Setting Vancouver School District ( British Columbia , Canada ) from kindergarten to grade 12 . Participants Active school staff enrolled from 3 February to 23 April 2021 with serology testing from 10 February to 15 May 2021 . Main outcome measures SARS - CoV - 2 seroprevalence among school staff , based on spike ( S ) - based ( unvaccinated staff ) or N - based serology testing ( vaccinated staff ) . Results Public health data showed the cumulative incidence of COVID - 19 among students attending in - person was 9 . 8 per 1000 students ( n = 47 280 ) , and 13 per 1000 among school staff ( n = 7071 ) . In a representative sample of 1689 school staff , 78 . 2 % had classroom responsibilities , and spent a median of 17 . 6 hours in class per week ( IQR : 5 . 0 – 25 hours ) . Although 21 . 5 % ( 363 / 1686 ) of surveyed staff self - reported close contact with a COVID - 19 case outside of their household ( 16 . 5 % contacts were school - based ) , 5 cases likely acquired the infection at school based on viral testing . Sensitivity / Specificity - adjusted seroprevalence in 1556 / 1689 staff ( 92 . 1 % ) was 2 . 3 % ( 95 % CI : 1 . 6 % to 3 . 2 % ) , comparable to a sex , age , date and residency area - weighted seroprevalence of 2 . 6 % ( 95 % CI : 2 . 2 % to 3 . 1 % ) among 5417 blood donors . Conclusion Seroprevalence among staff was comparable to a reference group of blood donors from the same community . These data show that in - person schooling could be safely maintained during the 2020 / 21 school year with mitigation measures , in a large school district in Vancouver , Canada . INTRODUCTION SARS - CoV - 2 forced over a billion students out - of - school globally in the Spring of 2020 . Decisions to close schools , motivated by high case mortality in populations , had serious implications for children’s emotional , social , physical and educational outcomes . 1 The risk of secondary SARS - CoV - 2 transmission within schools has been heavily debated . On the one hand , data support low rates of in - school SARS - CoV - 2 transmission , 2 – 12 with little increased transmission when schools re - opened . 13 – 18 On the other hand , few studies have accounted for asymptomatic transmission using antibody testing , and most have reported data early in the pandemic , or in the setting of partial school closure . 14 19 – 21 Strengths and limitations of this study ► Largest Canadian study in one of the few , if not only , jurisdiction in North America that maintained in - person schooling during the entire 2020 – 2021 school year . ► Reference data from entire school population , and robust reporting of seroprevalence based on ac - curate serology testing on a representative staff sample . ► Non - random participant selection , implying that a selection bias cannot be entirely excluded , although it is unlikely based on comparison of school staff sample with entire population . ► Limited power to detect small increase in seroprev - alence over representative community reference group of blood donors . ► Study predates the emergence of most variants of concerns in Canada , including the delta variant . 2 Goldfarb DM , et al . BMJ Open 2022 ; 12 : e057846 . doi : 10 . 1136 / bmjopen - 2021 - 057846 Open access In the spring of 2020 , British Columbia ( BC ) health authorities ordered a cessation of in - person schooling provincially , with a transition to remote learning from home . Like most of the world , the province went under a nearly complete lockdown between March and early June 2020 when most sectors of the economy were paused . In the global context , BC and Canada observed relatively low incident COVID - 19 cases compared with other areas of the world . 22 While BC reported relatively low commu - nity transmission , roughly > 50 times more cases were reported between 1 July 2020 and 15 May 2021 ( 136 291 cases in a population of 5 017 000 ) , compared with the first pandemic wave from February to May 2020 . 23 Despite increasing cases in late summer , BC was unique within Canada in that it maintained in - person schooling for the entire duration of the 2020 / 21 school year starting 8 September 2020 , except for regular winter ( 18 December 2020 to 4 January 2021 ) and spring ( 12 March to 29 March 2021 ) breaks . The main goal of this study was to determine the SARS - CoV - 2 seroprevalence in school staff in Vancouver public schools during the 2020 / 21 school year . The secondary objective was to compare the seroprevalence in school staff with a reference population of matched Canadian blood donors . MATERIALS AND METHODS Study design This study used baseline , cross - sectional data from a prospective study collected by questionnaire among active school staff of the Vancouver School District ( the District ) between 10 February and 15 May 2021 , with blood samples for serology testing collected from the same school staff between 10 February to 15 May 2021 , and serology data obtained between 1 January and 31 May 2021 from Canadian blood donors , weighted for age , sex and geographical area of residency . Participants School staff self - enrolled from 3 February to 23 April 2021 after receiving an introduction email from school principals from the District in early February 2021 , inviting them to register online at : https : / / www . bcchr . ca / COVIDatschools , for both a questionnaire and to provide blood for serology testing . A flyer was posted on the District website , and reminder emails were also sent . Interested participants completed a screener to identify whether they met eligibility criteria . Staff were included if they were a current , full or part - time staff member ( confirmed by District email address ) . Staff who reported being temporary staff , on - leave or on - call with no class - room time , or working exclusively in an adult education setting were ineligible . Study setting The District is a large , urban school district with 89 elemen - tary schools and 18 secondary schools ( 47 280 students and 7071 school staff ) located in the city of Vancouver ( BC , Canada ~ 600 000 population in the city of Vancouver with a population of ~ 2 . 6 million in urban area ) . Following a complete closure in March 2020 , schools opened in a limited fashion , except for students who use English as a second language and those with complex learning needs who were able to attend in - person 5 days / week until 30 June 2020 . On 8 September 2020 , schools reopened for the 2020 / 21 school year , except for a regularly scheduled winter break from 18 December 2020 to 4 January 2021 , and spring break from 12 to 29 March 2021 . COVID - 19 mitigations measures implemented in District schools as well as indications for viral testing are detailed in online supplemental appendix 1 . Data collection To estimate the degree of exposure to known COVID - 19 cases , we obtained data from Vancouver Coastal Health ( VCH ) ’s Case and Contact Management Interface . To this end , the District provided student and staff lists attending the District as of 17 May 2021 , to VCH , which linked the data to determine the cumulative incidence of COVID - 19 cases among all students and staff in District schools ( excluding the adult education staff ) . Staff and students affiliated with Vancouver Alternate Secondary School programmes were counted as attending a single school for the purposes of incidence calculations . To compare the COVID - 19 case data from VCH to the data from the prospective school staff sample obtained via questionnaires , we selected the median date of ques - tionnaire completion ( ie , 4 March 2021 ) as the end date for VCH COVID - 19 cases data extraction . We extracted all lab - confirmed , probable and epidemiologically linked COVID - 19 cases reported to VCH . To assess the cumula - tive incidence of known infection among staff over the course of the pandemic , we calculated the incidence of reported staff cases from 15 January 2020 ( corresponding to the first case reported to VCH ) to 4 March 2021 . Simi - larly , exposure to student cases during the school year was assessed using the incidence of confirmed , probable or epidemiologically linked COVID - 19 cases from the begin - ning of the school year ( 8 September 2020 ) to 4 March 2021 . Data from ( smaller size ) school annexes were combined to their corresponding attachment schools , as long as the school staff was shared between the two , for a total of 77 elementary and 18 secondary schools in the analysis . Data were collected from the school staff sample using a questionnaire that asked , among others , about risk factors for COVID - 19 , household structure , physical distancing behaviour , close contact with COVID - 19 cases ( defined by asking : “someone diagnosed with COVID - 19 with whom you’d been within two meters of for greater than two min ” ) , history of viral testing ( including dates and symptoms ) and vacci - nation , etc . 24 Analyses on risk factors for COVID - 19 and data from a second questionnaire about mental health and vaccine perception are not reported in this paper . For blood donors , we only had access to age , sex , first 3 3 Goldfarb DM , et al . BMJ Open 2022 ; 12 : e057846 . doi : 10 . 1136 / bmjopen - 2021 - 057846 Open access digits of postal code of residence and COVID - 19 vaccina - tion status at the time of blood donation using question - naires administered by Canadian Blood Services as part of the routine donation process . Serology testing Blood samples were collected at clinics set - up in multiple participating Vancouver schools geographically dispersed across the District , at the BC Children’s Hospital or outpa - tient clinical laboratories in the Vancouver area . The presence of antibodies against SARS - CoV - 2 was used as a marker of prior COVID - 19 infection , using dual S - based and N - based serology testing , where S - based serology was used in unvaccinated participants and N - based serology testing was used with vaccinated participants , or for blood donors in whom we did lack reliable data on vaccination status ( online supplemental figure 1 ) . Vaccines used in Canada elicit a spike ( S ) antibody response , whereas natural infection elicits both an S and a nucleocapsid ( N ) response . Thus , N responses can be used to determine if a participant has had prior infection regardless of vacci - nation status . Antibodies directed against the spike ( S1 ) protein were detected using the Ortho T VITROS Anti - SARS - CoV - 2 Total antibody assay ( Ortho Clinical Diagnostics , Rochester , New York , USA ) , a Health Canada and FDA - licensed qual - itative assay which detects IgA , IgG and IgM antibodies . S - based serology testing was done on a Vitros 5600 anal - yser at the BC Children’s & Women’s Hospital Labora - tory , which is accredited for clinical testing . Literature and in - house validation demonstrated this assay can iden - tify both symptomatic and asymptomatic infected indi - viduals > 7 days postillness onset with a sensitivity between 90 . 7 % and 97 . 7 % , and specificities between 99 . 4 % and 100 % . 25 26 Specimens were considered reactive at a cut - off index ≥ 1 . 00 . All S - tested negative samples with S - an - tibody indexes > 99th centile were also confirmed to be negative on the Roche assay . Testing for antinucleocapsid ( N ) protein SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies was performed using the Roche Elecsys Anti - SARS - CoV - 2 ( Roche Diagnostics Canada , Laval , Quebec , Canada ) . This qualitative total antibody assay is Health Canada - licensed and Food and Drug Administration - licensed with reported sensitivity of 88 . 5 % – 100 % at least 14 days post - COVID - 19 onset and specificity of 99 . 8 % – 100 % . 27 – 29 Testing was performed on a Cobas e601 analyzer at St . Paul’s Hospital Laboratory . Blood donors were screened prior to donation , to ensure they were in good health . People were ineligible to donate blood if they had a recent COVID - 19 infection 2 weeks after symptoms resolved , or were hospitalised within 3 weeks before . Blood donors were tested for N antibodies using the Roche Elecsys Anti - SARS - CoV - 2 assay on a Cobas e801 analyzer ( Roche Diagnostics Canada , Laval , Quebec , Canada ) . Sensitivity of 98 . 8 % and spec - ificity of 99 . 6 % were used for the nucleocapsid - based Roche Elecsys Anti - SARS - CoV - 2 assay . N antibodies have been shown to persist in blood after infection with assay sensitivity maintained until at least a year postinfection . 30 Bias minimisation strategies A number of measures were taken to facilitate / encourage participation : ( i ) strong buy - in from schools ( see ‘ Patient and public involvement ’ section ) ; ( ii ) easy participation : blood collection sites were set - up in schools over lunch and after work , in four geographically dispersed , centrally located area within the Vancouver School District , to ensure that the blood collection was readily accessible to participants . Other blood collection sites also included partnerships with hundreds of private community clinics in Vancouver ( open on weekends ) , the St . Paul’s Hospital ( high sampling volume , located in downtown Vancouver ) and the British Columbia Children’s Hospital ( located west of the District ) ; ( iii ) facilitation on the ground : we hired a full - time study coordinator to maintain contact and answer emails 7 days per week , and ensure a smooth study flow , facilitate bookings at blood collection sites with flexible hours , etc ( including driving around the city to meet the few participants who were unable to attend the multiple blood clinics ) ; ( iv ) participant incentives : partic - ipants were offered a CAD $ 20 incentive and serology results were returned to them . Patient and public involvement Right from the study design stage , District leaders , teacher and student support worker and parent associa - tions were engaged to obtain support and seek feedback on study feasibility . Weekly meetings occurred from study launching until publication of findings with a District leadership representative ( Collette O ' Reilly ) and a District liaison ( Kathy O’Sullivan ) to adjust study adver - tisement and procedures to maximise recruitment . At the end , results were shared immediately , initially with study participants , followed by BC and Canadian Public Health and government authorities , and health providers and experts from other Canadian provinces . Statistical analyses In absence of data available at the time on COVID - 19 transmission in schools , our initial sample size was set based on an anticipated increase in seroprevalence compared with earlier phases of the pandemic . We esti - mated that 2410 school staff would achieve 80 % power to detect a 2 . 2 - fold increase in prevalence estimates avail - able from April to June 2020 . 31 The Rogan - Gladen esti - mator was used to calculate the true prevalence adjusting for test specificity and sensitivity , with 95 % CIs estimated using Blaker’s method . 32 For the school staff , sensitivity of 95 . 3 % and specificity of 100 % were used for the S - based assay , 26 33 ignoring the small proportion of N - based assays used for outcome classification . For the blood donors , data were weighted by collection month , postal code , sex and age ( online supplemental data ) . Uncertainty of the serology tests was approached incorporating the uncer - tainty in test parameters using a Bayesian approach with no meaningful changes to 95 % CIs ( not shown ) . All anal - yses were done on complete cases . 4 Goldfarb DM , et al . BMJ Open 2022 ; 12 : e057846 . doi : 10 . 1136 / bmjopen - 2021 - 057846 Open access Data statement De - identified data will be made available upon written request through the COVID - 19 Immunity Task Force . RESULTS District - wide COVID - 19 exposure from students During the 2020 / 21 school year ( September 2020 to June 2021 ) , 46 879 students attended District schools in - person and 401 students attended an alternate District school ( total 47 280 students ) . As shown in figure 1 , overall weekly rates of reported COVID - 19 cases among staff and students during the pandemic followed a trend similar to the weekly rates among Vancouver residents . Population - level cumulative incidence of COVID - 19 cases among students ( total of 47 280 students ) during the 2020 / 21 school year was 9 . 8 cases per 1000 students ( median 8 . 2 ; range 0 – 63 cases per 1000 between schools ) . Each school had between 0 and 36 cases . Twelve schools had zero student cases . District - wide COVID - 19 cumulative incidence among school staff The cumulative incidence of COVID - 19 cases from 15 January 2020 to 4 March 2021 among the 5091 classroom school staff was 13 cases per 1000 , and was 14 cases per 1000 among 1980 other and non - classroom staff ( online supplemental table 1 ) . When looking at COVID - 19 cases since the beginning of the pandemic , 54 of 95 schools had no staff COVID - 19 cases , with a maximum of 3 staff cases per school . The cumulative incidence of COVID - 19 cases among 4 . 5 % staff members assigned to more than one school was 21 per 1000 staff . Characteristics of school staff sample In total , 2162 school staff accessed the initial study screening website , of which 1743 staff provided contact information and consented for serology testing ( figure 2 ) . The characteristics of 1689 staff who completed the ques - tionnaire are shown in table 1 . This corresponds to 23 . 9 % of all eligible staff . The age and sex of school staff in the sample were representative of the District population Figure 1 Weekly reported COVID - 19 cases among all school staff and students of the Vancouver School District , compared with all Vancouver residents .

BMJ Open 2022 ; 12 : e057846 . doi : 10 . 1136 / bmjopen - 2021 - 057846 Open access ( mean age±SD : 47 . 4±11 . 2 years ; 69 . 5 % female ( 76 . 2 % female among classroom staff ) ; n = 6751 with data avail - able ) . The proportion of school staff sampled for serology was evenly distributed among low vs high COVID - 19 inci - dence schools ( online supplemental figure 2 ) . The resi - dency distribution of the school staff sample was also geographically similar to the District population ( online supplemental data ) . A total of 78 . 2 % ( n = 1320 ) of our sample were class - room staff who spent a median of 17 . 6 hours of contact time with students per week ( table 1 ) . In comparison , the District estimated that 71 . 9 % ( n = 5091 ) of the 7071 eligible staff , had classroom responsibilities . Notably , the distribution of the school staff sample between elemen - tary and secondary schools ( table 1 ) , as well as the distri - bution of occupations of the school staff sample also reflected all staff in the District ( online supplemental table 2 ) . About one - third ( 37 % ) lived with an essential worker , predominantly in the social services , educa - tion / research / healthcare , construction , maintenance and skilled trades and food sectors ( table 2 ) . In total , 363 ( 21 . 5 % ) school staff reported close contact with a COVID - 19 case at or outside school , including 51 who reported close contact with a COVID - 19 case in their household ( table 2 ) .

Of the 24 school staff who reported a positive viral test , 4 ( 16 . 7 % ) tested positive prior to the beginning of classes in September 2020 . Five ( 21 % ) reported that the most likely source of infection was a close contact with a student or co - worker case , including one who required hospitalisation during the 2020 / 21 school year . Seven ( 29 % ) reported close contact with a friend or family member with COVID - 19 , and one reported close contact with both a co - worker and family member with COVID - 19 .

SARS - CoV - 2 seroprevalence in school staff sample by serology Of 1689 school staff who completed the prospective questionnaire , 1556 completed serology testing ( median blood collection date : 11 March 2021 ) . In total , 35 tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 by serology . Therefore , this corre - sponded to 46 % more infections diagnosed by serology compared with infections diagnosed by viral testing . Thirty - five staff ( 2 . 2 % ) of the 1556 school staff who completed serology were vaccinated at the time of blood testing . Individual serology results are shown in online supplemental tables 3 and 4 for vaccinated and SARS - CoV - 2 - infected staff , respectively . Accounting for vaccina - tion status , 35 school staff had a serology profile indicative of a previous COVID - 19 infection ( online supplemental figure 1 ) . Of the 35 school staff who had a positive serology indicative of infection , 29 worked in a classroom setting and one did not work in a classroom setting , but reported > 20 hours of contact time with students per week . The proportion of staff who tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 by serology between secondary and elementary schools ( table 3 ) was similar to the proportion of staff in each school level ( table 1 ) .

BMJ Open 2022 ; 12 : e057846 . doi : 10 . 1136 / bmjopen - 2021 - 057846 Open access code area distribution of the school staff sample closely matched the age , sex , period and residency location - weighted blood donor data ( online supplemental figure 3 ) . Poststratification seroprevalence analyses The proportion of females overall was slightly higher in the school sample compared with the District population . However , the seroprevalence in the school sample was similar , 2 . 6 % ( 95 % CI : 1 . 9 % to 3 . 6 % ) , after poststratifying for sex . Additionally , if we had sampled equally among schools , the poststratification seroprevalence would be 2 . 5 % ( 95 % CI : 1 . 8 % to 3 . 5 % ) and not statistically different than the original estimate in the school staff sample presented above of 2 . 2 % ( 95 % CI : 1 . 6 % to 3 . 1 % ) . DISCUSSION This study found that the seroprevalence among staff in Vancouver public schools was relatively low after a period of widespread community transmission predating the emergence of variants of concerns . Results were consis - tent with COVID - 19 cases reported by VCH . Findings are in keeping with modelling studies 34 35 and data from the UK where low seroprevalence was also measured in teachers , but this was earlier in the pandemic . 14 To the best of our knowledge , this study is the largest Canadian study , and one of the largest overall , to report seropreva - lence estimates in the context of continuously maintained in - person schooling and widespread viral transmission late in the 2020 / 21 academic year . Despite that the sero - prevalence in this study was approximately threefold higher relative to previous estimates of 0 . 55 % – 0 . 6 % obtained from Vancouver residents in spring 2020 , 31 36 37 it remained comparable to the community , as determined from blood donors of the same age , sex and living in the same community . Another study reported SARS - CoV - 2 seroprevalence in the school setting in North America . 38 A major advan - tage of the current study is that it was conducted in BC , one of the few jurisdictions in North America that main - tained in - person schooling during the 2020 / 21 school year . About one - quarter of the ~ 132 444 COVID - 19 cases reported in BC during this period were located in the regional health authority where the city of Vancouver and its District are located . Study results are drawn from a large sample of staff , including a majority of those exposed to COVID - 19 in the classroom . The study used sensitive serology testing to identify cumulative SARS - CoV - 2 cases that may have not come to clinical attention , but could still contribute to the transmission chain . 39 The use of S - based serology assays identified COVID - 19 cases up to a year before . Conversely , the N - based serology test allowed us to assess for infections in vaccinated staff towards the end of recruitment . The high proportion ( 60 % ) of cases diagnosed by viral testing who also tested positive via serology contrasts with a recent review finding that on average the ratio of anti - body to viral detection of cases was up to over 18 . 40 Our findings would suggest good access to viral testing in this specific setting , during the study period . Among our study participants , 21 . 5 % ( 363 ) of school staff reported a close contact with a COVID - 19 case , and the majority ( 76 . 6 % , 278 / 363 ) identified contact with a COVID - 19 case at school . These data alone could rein - force the perception that schools are a risky environment . However , despite the high frequency of school staff who reported close contacts , and symptoms ( table 2 ) , 90 . 1 % ( 598 / 664 ) had no serological evidence of infection using a sensitive testing strategy . Thus , we were able to provide a more accurate depiction of actual viral infections . In light of these data we could not find evidence to substan - tiate the perception that a large number of asymptomatic infections have been missed through contact tracing . Mitigation strategies employed in BC schools have been shown elsewhere to minimise risk in educators to a level comparable to the risk in the community . 41 42 Although non - medical masks were encouraged , but were not required for students in schools in BC until February 2021 ( grades 8 – 12 ) and end of March 2021 ( grades 4 – 12 ) , we did not observe any difference in seroprevalence between elementary and secondary school staff . Of note all school staff from the District were required to mask indoors ( which is reflected in our survey results ) and this inter - vention has been associated with lower risk of infection . 41 This study has limitations . First , non - random partici - pant selection among the school staff population implies a potential volunteer bias . However , the similar demo - graphic characteristics , and the similar incidence of COVID - 19 cases among the school staff sample ( 1 . 4 % ) compared with the entire District ( 1 . 3 % ) suggests that we did not undersample those at risk . Second , blood donors are healthier and therefore , may not be a reliable esti - mate of community seroprevalence , though there are likely representative of school staff compared with other socioeconomic - deprived populations at higher risk of COVID - 19 . 43 44 Effectively , underestimation of the sero - prevalence in blood donors would only reinforce our conclusion . Third , this study was conducted before the more transmissible delta or omicron variants . Based on contact tracing data , we recently showed that secondary transmission in District schools remained infrequent even in the delta era . 45 Further serology testing is planned in three main school district in Vancouver ( including the one surveyed in the current study ) in the spring of 2022 , Table 3 Seropositive cases according to school education level where school staff teaches / assists School Frequency Cases ( % ) Elementary 19 54 . 3 Secondary 9 25 . 7 Multiple / Mixed 3 8 . 6 School board office 4 11 . 4 Total 35 100 9 Goldfarb DM , et al . BMJ Open 2022 ; 12 : e057846 . doi : 10 . 1136 / bmjopen - 2021 - 057846 Open access which should determine if these conclusions will hold true during the omicron era . In conclusion , this study shows no detectable increase in SARS - CoV - 2 infections in school staff working in Vancouver public schools following a period of wide - spread community transmission ( October 2020 to May 2021 ) , compared with a reference group of blood donors from the same age , sex and community area . Vaccination of school staff and older student age groups , together with the introduction of more transmissible variants requires ongoing evaluation of COVID - 19 infections within the school community .
