Korn , National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , MD , and approved March 3 , 2004 ( received for review November 20 , 2003 ) Dynamic actin networks generate forces for numerous types of movements such as lamellipodia protrusion or the motion of endocytic vesicles . The actin - based propulsive movement of Liste - ria monocytogenes or of functionalized microspheres have been extensively used as model systems to identify the biochemical components that are necessary for actin - based motility . However , quantitative force measurements are required to elucidate the mechanism of force generation , which is still under debate . To directly probe the forces generated in the process of actin - based propulsion , we developed a micromanipulation experiment . A comet growing from a coated polystyrene bead is held by a micropipette while the bead is attached to a force probe , by using a specially designed ‘‘ﬂexible handle . ’’ This system allows us to apply both pulling and pushing external forces up to a few nanonewtons . By pulling the actin tail away from the bead at high speed , we estimate the elastic modulus of the gel and measure the force necessary to detach the tail from the bead . By applying a constant force in the range of (cid:1) 1 . 7 to 4 . 3 nN , the force – velocity relation is established . We ﬁnd that the relation is linear for pulling forces and decays more weakly for pushing forces . This behavior is explained by using a dimensional elastic analysis . T he growth of a polymer against a barrier is a general mechanism for production of force in cell biology ( 1 ) . Spatially controlled polymerization of actin is responsible for a large variety of changes in cell shape leading to cell movement , like the protrusion of the lamellipodium ( 2 ) , or the intracellular propulsion of vesicles ( 3 , 4 ) and pathogens ( 5 , 6 ) . Actin assembly in these processes is controlled by various proteins present in the cytoplasm , which have been identified over the last 10 years ( see refs . 7 and 8 for review ) . It is now well established that the Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex associates with Wiskott – Aldrich Syndrome protein ( WASp ) family proteins to create new filaments locally by branching them ( 9 ) , thus generating the dendritic organiza - tion of the actin array ( 10 , 11 ) . Because pure actin treadmilling is too slow to account for polymerization speed observed in these systems , this process has to be speeded up by regulatory proteins ( 8 ) . One experimental model that has been used widely for the identification of these proteins is the bacteria Listeria monocy - togenes , which are propelled inside cells by actin polymerization . The minimal subset of proteins necessary and sufficient to reconstitute the Listeria movement has been identified ( 12 ) . In addition to Arp2 (cid:1) 3 and actin , the regulatory proteins ADF (cid:1) cofilin , profilin , and a capping protein are necessary to enhance the efficiency of treadmilling ( 13 ) and control the life time and average length of filaments ( 14 , 15 ) . The essential role of these proteins has been confirmed recently ( 16 ) in vivo by using a RNA interference strategy . Biomimetic systems are useful for analyzing the physical aspects of actin - based motility . Listeria movement can be mim - icked by functionalized polystyrene beads catalyzing filament branching at their surface and undergoing actin - based propul - sion when placed in cell extracts or in the reconstituted motility medium . These systems have been used to characterize the process of actin comet formation ( 17 ) , to measure the elastic properties of actin gels growing from a surface ( 18 ) , and to explore the dynamical regimes of actin - based propulsion by varying the size of the bead ( 19 ) . In a mixture of purified proteins that reconstitute Listeria movement , beads activating actin polymerization move in a wide range of size ( up to 10 (cid:1) m diameter ) and display various types of movement ( 19 ) . This is an advantage over the Listeria system in which such parameters cannot be changed . Within a cell , micrometer size objects moving at a velocity of the order of a few micrometers per minute have to oppose the viscous force ( Stokes force ) of 1 fN . Indirect approaches have been developed recently to evaluate the mag - nitude of the propulsive force . Increasing the viscosity of the medium by several orders of magnitude only slightly slowed down bead movement ( 20 ) , suggesting that the propulsive force is much larger than 50 pN . This result is in disagreement with the reported observation of a dramatic decrease in Listeria velocity under a 0 – 50 pN viscous force ( 21 ) . Other experiments however ( 22 , 23 ) suggested that the propelling force is much larger , of the order of few nN . Likewise , the force exerted by the lamellipo - dium on a moving cell is of the order of a few nN ( 24 ) . The discrepancies described above call for direct measurements of the force generated by actin polymerization , which are carried out here . To exert a relevant range of forces , actin - propelled beads are micromanipulated by using a flexible handle as a force probe and a micropipette to hold the tail . By using this design , various experiments can be performed because either the force or the pulling velocity can be controlled whereas the bead and the comet can be visualized optically during the experiment . We measure the force required to detach the actin tail from the bead and estimate the comet elastic modulus . Furthermore , we pro - duce a force – velocity diagram in the range of pulling ( (cid:1) 1 . 7 nN ) to pushing ( 4 . 3 nN ) forces . This experimental setup allows for a direct , in situ measurement of the force generated in actin - based propulsion . Materials and Methods Micropipettes . Micropipettes ( Fisher Scientific ) were prepared with a P2000 pipette puller ( Sutter Instruments , Novato , CA ) . Their tip was broken by insertion in a molten drop of soda - lime glass ( 25 ) by using a microforge ( Narishige , Tokyo ) with a (cid:2) 60 objective ( Olympus , Melville , NY ) to allow inner - tip diameter control . Micropipettes designed for bead holding had an inner diameter of (cid:3) 1 . 5 (cid:1) m . Micropipettes that were used to function - alize beads were 4 . 5 (cid:1) m in diameter . The tip of micropipettes used to hold the actin tail was narrowed , by an additional heating step , to an internal diameter of 1 . 5 (cid:1) m , with a surrounding 3 . 5 - (cid:1) m discoid wall . Glass Fibers . Two different fibers were obtained from either glass rods or glass wool microfibers . Glass rods ( 1 - mm diameter ; This paper was submitted directly ( Track II ) to the PNAS ofﬁce .

The tip of the rod was broken at a 1 . 5 - (cid:1) m diameter by using the same process as for micropipettes . The tapered rods were etched in HF ( 10 % in water ) for 9 – 12 min to reduce the end diameter to tens of micrometers in a reproducible way ( 26 ) . Microfibers from glass wool ( Lauscha Fiber , Lauscha , Germany ) were dispersed in water and dried on a microscope slide . One microfiber ( 100 – 500 (cid:1) m long , (cid:3) 0 . 3 - (cid:1) m diameter ) was caught with a glass microneedle and inserted into the tip of a micropipette ( 3 - (cid:1) m inner - tip diameter ) filled with optical glue . The microfiber was then immobilized by polymerizing the glue . Optical Bonding . NOA68 optical glue ( Norland Products , Cran - bury , NJ ) was used to hold microfibers in micropipettes , to attach the beads to the fibers , and to fix platinum wires to microneedles . The laser beam from a UV - pulsed laser ( 337 nm ; Laser Science , Cambridge , MA ) was expanded by a telescope and focused to a 4 - (cid:1) m spot by using a (cid:2) 40 UV objective ( Olympus ) . The glue was polymerized under UV irradiation for 10 s . Force - Probe Calibration by Using a Platinum Filament as a Spring Reference . A 1 - cm - long silver - coated platinum Wollaston wire ( 100 - (cid:1) m outer diameter , 0 . 6 - (cid:1) m inner - platinum sheath diame - ter ; Goodfellow , Berwyn , PA ) was placed on a microscope slide and held on the surface by fixing its extremities with poly ( di - methyl siloxane ) ( PDMS ) ribbons that stick to the glass . A platinum filament was obtained by removing the silver outer sheath by a 70 % nitric acid treatment for 1 h and then rinsing and drying . It was then cut into a 200 - (cid:1) m - long filament by UV laser ablation under the microscope and fixed perpendicularly to a microneedle by optical gluing . Its rigidity was measured with the thermal - fluctuations method ( 27 ) . The image of the wire was projected on a two - quadrant photodetector ( United Detector Technology ) with a (cid:2) 1 , 000 magnification . Position fluctuations were recorded ( with a precision of 0 . 2 nm ) and analyzed with LABVIEW software ( National Instruments , Austin , TX ) . The rigidity was obtained by fitting the fluctuation power fast Fourier transform spectrum with a Lorentzian ( in the 10 Hz to 3 kHz frequency range ) . The rigidity of the filaments ranged from 0 . 2 to 0 . 8 nN (cid:1) (cid:1) m , with a precision ranging from 3 % to 20 % , depending on filament . To measure the flexible handle rigidity , the end of the platinum filament was placed against the handle at the position of the bead . While the handle was kept at a fixed position , the micropipette carrying the attached filament was translated on a 10 - (cid:1) m course with 0 . 2 - (cid:1) m increments by using a piezoelectric displacement ( LISA ; Physik Instrumente , Karlsruhe , Germany ) . At each step the fiber deflection was measured by tracking the bead position with the ‘‘track - object’’ component of METAMORPH software ( Universal Imaging , Me - dia , PA ) . The rigidity k (cid:4) of the handle was derived from the slope p of the deflection versus displacement plot and the rigidity k of the platinum filament by using k (cid:4) (cid:5) k ( 1 (cid:1) p ) (cid:1) p . Experimental Setup . When attached on a microfiber , a 2 - (cid:1) m polystyrene bead ( Polysciences ) is coated by purified N - WASp ( 0 . 75 (cid:1) M solution in buffer X ) ( 20 ) for 10 min and then rinsed in a 1 % BSA solution in buffer X . Experiments were performed in a PDMS (cid:1) glass chamber , which was built as follows : a 1 - mm - thick PDMS rectangle ( 2 (cid:2) 1 . 5 cm ) was deposited on a micro - scope slide and a 1 mm large L - shape channel is cut . The chamber was filled with 25 (cid:1) l of standard motility medium made from pure proteins ( 28 ) at the following concentrations : 0 . 1 (cid:1) M Arp2 – Arp3 (cid:1) 0 . 1 (cid:1) M gelsolin (cid:1) 4 . 2 (cid:1) M ADF (cid:1) 2 . 6 (cid:1) M profilin (cid:1) 7 . 4 (cid:1) M actin . The optical visualization was made by using a (cid:2) 60 air - phase contrast objective ( Olympus ) mounted on an inverted microscope ( IX51 ; Olympus ) , and images were taken by a cooled Cool Snap charge - coupled device ( Princeton Instruments , Tren - ton , NJ ) . Experiment Automation . For any kind of experiment , the force is measured by tracking the bead position every (cid:3) 0 . 3 s on small images ( (cid:3) 10 (cid:2) 5 (cid:1) m 2 ) centered on the bead by using the track - object component of METAMORPH software ( Universal Imaging ) . The zero force is determined by locating the bead position on the small image before comet handling . Every 30 steps ( (cid:3) 9 s ) , a large image ( 50 (cid:2) 40 (cid:1) m ) is taken to visualize the handle and the entire comet . For fast - pulling experiments , the micropipette is displaced by an amount proportional to the imposed velocity and the time interval between two tracks . For force – velocity experiments , a feedback loop is used to apply a constant force on the system ( equivalent to a constant deflection ) . For each step , the proportional feedback loop ( custom program ) calculates the displacement to apply to the micropipette to correct the deflection that is imposed within a 30 - nm error . The maximal correction speed is 18 (cid:1) m (cid:1) s . Comet - Dimensions Measurements . The diameter of the actin tail is measured as follows . The intensity ( from the phase contrast image ) is measured along a line perpendicular to the axis of the actin tail at a distance half - way between the handle and the micropipette . Each data point is the averaged density recorded over a 0 . 5 - (cid:1) m - wide band across this line . The diameter is defined as the distance between the minimum and the maximum of the intensity derivative over distance . The precision is 0 . 2 (cid:1) m . The length of the actin tail equals the distance between the bead and the micropipette and is measured manually on the image with a precision of 0 . 1 (cid:1) m . Results Experimental Design . Forces generated by actin polymerization are measured by using a flexible handle made of a bead attached to a glass fiber ( Fig . 1 A ) . A 2 - (cid:1) m bare polystyrene bead is fixed to any type of glass fiber ( see Materials and Methods ) by micromanipulation and gluing under the microscope as follows . A suspension of 2 - (cid:1) m polystyrene beads in pure water is deposited in the PDMS (cid:1) slide well . A drop of glue is placed on the slide , 5 mm away from the well . The fiber tip is plunged into the glue and pulled out quickly . The glue remaining on the tip forms a droplet 1 – 2 (cid:1) m in diameter depending on the speed at which the tip of the fiber was pulled . One bead is then grabbed off the suspension , held by suction with a micropipette of 1 . 5 - (cid:1) m inner diameter mounted perpendicularly to the fiber . The bead is driven in air and put into contact with the fiber - tip droplet . The microscope stage , on which the whole micromanipulating setup Fig . 1 .

The glue is then polymerized by firing the laser for 10 s . The fiber - bound bead is then released from the micropipette by applying an overpressure . An example of an attached bead is given in Fig . 1 A . The handle is then calibrated with a spring reference . The rigidities of the flexible handles vary from 0 . 8 to 4 nN (cid:1) (cid:1) m for pulled fibers and from 0 . 2 to 0 . 8 nN (cid:1) (cid:1) m for glass microfibers . By using a micropipette as a reservoir , the bead at the end of the flexible handle is coated with the protein N - WASp . The micropipette ( 4 . 5 - (cid:1) m tip inner diameter ) is filled with the solution of N - WASp . The handle is rinsed in pure water and set in air under the microscope . The handle bead is inserted in the micropipette tip while the rest of the handle remains in contact with air to make sure that N - WASp is adsorbed exclusively on the bead surface ( Fig . 1 B ) . After 10 min at room temperature , the bead is released from the micropipette and the whole handle is covered with BSA ( 1 % solution ) and left 5 min for incubation to saturate all available adsorption sites . The handle is driven out from the BSA solution and then placed in one branch of the L - shape cell channel that was filled previously with the motility medium . A micropipette filled with X buffer is inserted in the other branch of the channel to hold the actin comet ( Fig . 2 ) . It is mounted on the piezoelectric displacement and connected to a syringe . The sample is then covered by liquid PDMS ( 500 cst ; 5 (cid:2) 10 (cid:1) 4 m 2 (cid:1) s ) to prevent evaporation . As soon as the flexible handle is in the motility medium , actin polymerizes at the bead surface and an actin tail grows from the bead within a few minutes at a rate within the range of velocities measured for 2 - (cid:1) m free beads in the same medium ( 1 – 3 (cid:1) m (cid:1) min ) . The depolymerization is very weak , and comets can reach lengths of up to hundreds of micrometers for several hours ( up to 15 h ) . The comet is held with a micropipette as described for chromosomes ( 29 ) . The tip is brought close to the comet distal end , and a negative pressure is applied by moving the syringe with a micropositioner , thus drawing the actin gel toward the tip . Because the aperture of the tip is at least two times smaller than the comet section , the gel stop - gaps the micropipette ( see Fig . 2 c ) . Note that the strength of the actin gel is sufficient to hold the local shear applied at the aperture section . The applied pressure is large enough for the comet to remain blocked on the tip while applying pulling or pushing forces up to several nanonewtons for tens of minutes . The force is applied to the bead – comet system by moving the comet holder ( Fig . 2 a ) along the comet axis with the piezoelec - tric displacement . Our experimental design allows for pushing or pulling on the comet . Under such an action , the flexible handle is deflected and its deflection , d , is proportional to the force applied on the bead . This deflection ( Fig . 2 b ) is measured by tracking the bead position on small images ( Fig . 2 b ; tracking region ) . Pushing forces up to 4 . 3 nN and pulling forces up to 3 nN can be applied . Pulling the Actin Comet . By pulling on the actin tail , one can impose larger velocities than the ‘‘natural’’ zero load velocity for free beads . Various different experiments can be processed : the comet can be gently pulled or quickly torn away from the bead , which is the case on which we will focus now . Under fast - pulling at a constant micropipette velocity of 10 (cid:1) m (cid:1) min , three regimes are observed . First , the comet remains attached to the bead and sustains the force imposed by the deflected fiber ( Fig . 3 d ) . Under such conditions , the comet lengthens by an amount (cid:2) L (cid:5) p (cid:1) d , as defined in Fig . 2 . Then follows a nonlinear regime in which the force reaches a maximum ( 2 . 8 nN in the case presented in Fig . 3 a ) . Subsequently , there is an abrupt drop of the force while (cid:2) L jumps to a higher value . This event corresponds to a rupture of the bead – comet connection ( Fig . 3 e ) . The bead appears to be bald ; the rupture of the comet occurs exclusively at the bead surface . Remarkably , after the comet has been torn off , a new comet is still able to grow from the bead . The new growing comet has identical properties ( same speed , geometric characteristics , and density ) as the previous comet ( Fig . 3 f and Movie 1 , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site ) . The ability to rebuild a gel allows us to perform various Fig . 2 . Experimental scheme and image .

Force – Velocity Diagram : Pushing and Pulling on the Actin Tail with a Constant Force . By using this experimental design , a constant force in the (cid:1) 1 . 7 to 4 . 3 nN range is applied to the actin - propelled bead , and the associated velocity is measured , yielding to a force – velocity diagram . The convention for the sign of the force is that pushing forces ( opposing free - bead movement ) have a positive value to keep the convention that has been used in studies ( 20 , 21 , 30 ) . This force is then the opposite of the external force , (cid:1) F ext , applied to the bead . A constant force is applied by a feedback loop . Under this condition , the velocity is well defined during this process and can be identified with the stationary velocity ( smaller or larger than the zero force speed for positive and negative forces , respectively ) in the 0 . 35 – 3 . 5 (cid:1) m (cid:1) min range . Fig . 4 shows an example of a 1 . 7 nN imposed force during 8 min ( Fig . 4 a ) . The comet lengthens ( Fig . 4 b ) with a constant velocity of 1 . 1 (cid:1) m (cid:1) min . See Movie 2 , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site , for a movie of a typical experiment ( force (cid:1) 0 . 94 nN ) . The force – velocity diagram is displayed in Fig . 4 c . Each point corresponds to an average of one to three experiments made at constant force in a single run . For each flexible handle , the velocity V F (cid:5) 0 measured at zero force is used to normalize the velocity at a given force ( vertical axis of Fig . 4 c ) . Note that the value of V F (cid:5) 0 varies from handle to handle because of fluctuations in the coating process and different activity of protein batches . Its average value of 1 . 75 (cid:6) 0 . 6 (cid:1) m (cid:1) min is measured on eight flexible handles . The normalized velocities are between 0 . 2 and 1 . 7 for forces ranging from (cid:1) 1 . 7 to 4 . 3 nN . For pulling forces , the force – velocity relation is essentially linear . For pushing forces , the normalized velocity decreases more gently as the force is increased . A force of 4 . 3 nN is not sufficient to stop the growth of the actin comet . Under such a load , the velocity is 20 % of the velocity at zero load . Because of comet buckling under larger forces , the value of the stall force cannot be reached experimentally , but a lower estimate is 4 . 3 nN . The gel thickness e on the side of the bead is extracted from the comet - diameter values ( (cid:3) ) measured in a subset of constant - force experiments using simply e (cid:5) ( (cid:3) (cid:1) 2 R ) (cid:1) 2 , where R is the bead radius . This thickness increases when the velocity de - creases , and it tends to saturate for the smallest velocity values ( Fig . 4 d ) . Note that the comets appear to be hollow for small velocities ( large opposing forces ) as can be seen in Fig . 4 g . Discussion We have designed an experiment to explore the mechanics of actin - based propulsion . The flexible handle system permits us to apply both pushing and pulling forces , up to several nanonew - tons , to the growing actin meshwork dynamically coupled to the propelled bead . We now discuss the measurements of the mechanical properties of the actin gel , its attachment to the bead surface , and the force – velocity relation . Estimation of the Elastic Modulus of the Actin Tail . From fast - pulling experiments , we can estimate the elastic modulus of the actin comet . When it is pulled at a velocity larger than the free - growing velocity , the actin tail undergoes an elastic deformation . As a consequence , the force - versus - lengthening curve is linear ( Fig . 3 b ) because the contribution of the comet growth is negligible compared with the elastic deformation . Its slope equals the rigidity , k c , of the comet . The elastic modulus E of the gel is then obtained with the equation E (cid:4) dF d (cid:7) l e (cid:5) l c S c (cid:4) k c l c S c ( 31 ) , where l c and S c are the comet length and section , respec - tively , measured by image analysis . Measurement of the elastic modulus from 11 experiments yields an average value of 3 , 700 Pa with a lower bound of 700 and a higher bound of 6 , 700 . This value is consistent with the one measured previously for Listeria in platelets – Xenopus extract by using optical tweezers to buckle comet fragments ( 32 ) , which is 10 3 to 10 4 Pa . Tearing the Comet Apart . Because the rupture occurs always at the bead surface , it is likely that the gel breaks at the bead – gel interface behaving as it would in an adhesive rupture event . The fact that a new actin tail resumes initiation and growth after removal of the original tail indicates that the N - WASp molecules remain at the surface of the bead and that the weakest points of the system are the links between the filaments and immobilized N - WASp . Interestingly , the process of pulling out the actin tail does not damage the activating function of the proteins immo - bilized at the bead surface . The pull - out force is 3 . 0 (cid:6) 0 . 5 nN at the pulling velocity of 10 Fig . 4 . Force – velocitydiagram . ( a and b ) Typicalmeasurementforonepoint of the force – velocity diagram .

Although it is known that such a force depends on the velocity at which the object is pulled ( 33 ) , we obtain here an estimate of the force necessary to detach the comet from the bead . The relevant parameter to describe the strength of the attachment is the stress applied by the actin gel on the bead . We cannot precisely measure the surface of the bead coated with N - WASp . However , taking the total bead surface gives a lower estimate of the stress applied on the bead surface of 0 . 25 nN (cid:1) (cid:1) m 2 . Force – Velocity Relation . The force – velocity relation characterizes the ability for a moving object to sustain its velocity while a load is applied . In the case of L . monocytogenes , it is an important feature because these bacteria have to cross cell membranes to disseminate : they must keep moving against the force exerted by these obstacles . Various force – velocity relations have been predicted by different theoretical models of actin - based propul - sion ( 30 , 34 – 36 ) ( see ref . 37 for review ) . Mogilner and Oster ( 30 ) propose that within a microscopic model , the relation is essen - tially biphasic with a rapid decay for small forces and a smooth one for higher forces . They indicate that the decay can be less pronounced when the number of filaments is increased . Carlsson ( 34 ) finds a similar relation for the dendritic nucleation scheme but with essentially no decrease in velocity in relation with force for the autocatalytic filament branching scheme . By using a mesoscopic elastic analysis , Gerbal et al . ( 36 ) find a shallow force – velocity curve and predict that forces of the order of nanonewtons are necessary to slow down Listeria movement significantly . Two independent experiments in which external forces were applied on actin - propelled objects by adjusting the external viscosity led to differing results ( 20 , 21 ) . A sharp velocity drop at very low forces ( 10 pN ) followed by a slow decrease is observed for Listeria in extracts , whereas beads in a pure reconstituted protein medium display a very weak decrease in velocity over a similar force range . Both studies were limited to forces of 100 – 200 pN . Here , we are able to apply larger forces of a few nanonewtons . Let us now examine the experimental results in the light of the elastic analysis initially proposed by Gerbal et al . ( 36 ) and use a simplified formulation based on a dimensional analysis ( 38 ) . In spherical topology , the addition of monomers at the internal surface of the gel generates a strain in the gel layer covering the bead . The associated tensile stress is maximum at the external surface of the gel layer and vanishes at the inner surface . It integrates into a net tension of the layer , which in the presence of curvature translates into a normal stress similar to a Laplace pressure at the gel – bead interface . This normal stress ( Fig . 5 ) creates a propulsive polymerization - based elastic force , F e1 , when integrated over the bead surface . The external force , F ext , creates an additional stress in the gel . This stress being conser - vative ( (cid:8) (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:5) (cid:1) 0 ) , its integration on the bead - gel interface equals precisely the external force . Thus , this force is entirely transmit - ted at the bead – gel interface . The motion of the gel with respect to the bead generates a friction F fric because of the dynamical interaction between the gel and the actin polymerization acti - vators . Let us concentrate on the simple case of a hollow comet . Indeed , we show in Supporting Text , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site , that it is a valid procedure because the contribution of the inner part of the comet ( light gray in Fig . 6 , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site ) is negligible . In that case , one can directly balance the external force and the elastic force by the friction force at the bead – gel interface : F ext (cid:8) F el (cid:8) F fric (cid:4) 0 . [ 1 ] F el reads F el (cid:3) E ( e 3 (cid:1) R ) ( 38 , ¶ ) , where E is the elastic gel modulus , e is the gel thickness on the side of the bead , and R is the bead radius . We assume that the elastic modulus is constant and does not depend on the applied force . The friction force may be expressed as F fric (cid:5) (cid:1) S (cid:6) V for small - enough gel – bead relative velocity V , where S is the gel – bead contact surface and (cid:6) is a friction coefficient per unit area ( 36 ) . This term results from the finite lifetime of the activator – actin filament association ( 39 ) . The dimensional relation between the external force and the velocity becomes : F ext (cid:8) E e 3 R (cid:3) S (cid:6) V . [ 2 ] One still needs to express the velocity dependence on the gel thickness . A good description of the experimental data are obtained with the empirical formula : e (cid:9) V (cid:10) (cid:4) e * (cid:4) 1 (cid:9) exp (cid:5) (cid:1) V p 0 R Ve * (cid:6)(cid:7) . [ 3 ] This formula interpolates between two natural limits . For small velocities close enough to stalling condition , the gel thickness is that of the steady state gel thickness e * obtained in spherical geometry in the absence of symmetry breaking ( 18 ) . For large velocities , the gel thickness is given by the polymerization rate V p 0 multiplied by the time ( R (cid:1) V ) spent by the gel at the surface of the bead : e (cid:5) R ( V p 0 (cid:1) V ) . The fit of the relation between e and V according to Eq . 3 is quite satisfactory ( Fig . 4 d ) and gives e * (cid:5) 2 . 0 (cid:6) 0 . 2 (cid:1) m and V p 0 (cid:1) V ( F (cid:5) 0 ) (cid:5) (cid:6) 0 . 3 , providing an estimate of the polymerization velocity V p 0 (cid:3) 1 . 6 (cid:6) 1 . 1 (cid:1) m (cid:1) min . The subsequent fit of the experimental data points linking velocity to force involves only two parameters : the surface friction coefficient (cid:6) and the elastic modulus E ( Fig . 4 c ) . For large positive forces , the friction term dominates the response . For vanishing forces , a balance between the elastic force and the friction force takes over . For significant external negative forces , the response is essentially due to the elastic force . Because the gel thickness increases when the opposing force increases , the resulting motion exhibits natural self - strengthening . We find (cid:6) (cid:3) 3 . 10 10 Pa (cid:1) s (cid:1) m and E (cid:3) 10 3 Pa . Because Eq . 3 is a scaling relation , these numbers have a meaning only in terms of order of magnitude . It is interesting to note that the elastic modulus value agrees within a factor of 4 with our measurement extracted from fast - pulling experiments . Similarly , the friction value lies within the range estimated in ref . 36 . The ratio E (cid:1) (cid:6) (cid:5) V i is a velocity characteristic of the ¶ Notethat , inprinciple , weshoulduse F el (cid:5) E (cid:1) Re 3 ( 1 (cid:11) e (cid:1) 2 R ) . Wecheckedthatthisdoesnot lead to any signiﬁcant change in the data analysis . Fig . 5 . Schematic representation of the elastic analysis in the case of a pushing external force F ext .

We find V i (cid:3) 2 (cid:1) m (cid:1) min , compa - rable with V p 0 . The similarity of the two values is not entirely fortuitous : a large mismatch would generate large stresses at the bead - inner gel interface , which would lead to hollow comets ( 36 ) . In fact , close to stall force , we do see such hollowness ( Fig . 4g ) because of the external stress . At last , the fitting curve predicts that the stall force value is of the order of 7 nN . Conclusion We present a force probe experiment that allows for the control of the velocity of actin polymerization under an external force . Our data give the force – velocity diagram for both pushing and pulling forces . The force – velocity diagram is in agreement with an elastic analysis of the system . It provides numbers for the pull out force , the gel elastic modulus , the gel – bead friction coeffi - cient , the polymerization velocity , and an estimate of the stall force . This experimental setup paves the way for investigation of actin gel properties on the efficiency of actin - based propulsion because it provides a direct measurement of the force . It might be used for testing the effect on force generation directly when drugs acting on actin assembly are at work . We thank S . Wiesner for his help in using the purified proteins , P .
