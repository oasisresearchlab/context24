Determination of the optimal quarantine period for international travelers is crucial to prevent the local spread caused by imported COVID‑19 cases . We performed a retrospective epidemiological study using 491 imported COVID‑19 cases in Chengdu , China , to describe the characteristic of the cases and estimate the time from arrival to confirmation for international travelers using nonparametric survival methods . Among the 491 imported COVID‑19 cases , 194 ( 39 . 5 % ) were asymptomatic infections . The mean age was 35 . 6 years ( SD = 12 . 1 years ) and 83 . 3 % were men . The majority ( 74 . 1 % ) were screened positive for SARS‑CoV‑2 , conducted by Chengdu Customs District , the People’s Republic of China . Asymptomatic cases were younger than presymptomatic or symptomatic cases ( P < 0 . 01 ) . The daily number of imported COVID‑19 cases displayed jagged changes . 95 % of COVID‑19 cases were confirmed by PT‑PCR within 14 days ( 95 % CI 13 – 15 ) after arriving in Chengdu . A 14‑day quarantine measure can ensure non‑infection among international travelers with a 95 % probability . Policymakers may consider an extension of the quarantine period to minimize the negative consequences of the COVID‑19 confinement and prevent the international spread of COVID‑19 . Nevertheless , the government should consider the balance between COVID‑19 and socioeconomic development , which may cause more serious social and health crises . Coronavirus Disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) , caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) , has affected hundreds of millions of people and caused millions of deaths globally 1 . International flights provide the opportunity for the global spread of COVID - 19 2 . In Africa , air traffic is significantly associated with COVID - 19 morbidity and mortality , and plays an important role in the geographical spread of the disease 3 . Travel restriction and travel quarantine have helped mitigate the international spread of COVID - 19 2 , 4 , 5 . The quarantine duration was determined by the incubation period , the time from exposure to an infectious disease to the onset of symptoms . Theoretically , it’s preferable to quarantine international travelers for a longer period than the maximum incubation period since the person - to - person transmission prior to symptom onset 6 – 9 . The estimated length of the incubation period of COVID - 19 varies across the disease severity , model methods , and sample sizes 10 – 21 . Thus , the optimal quarantine duration for COVID - 19 needs to be assessed using the previ - ously reported incubation period . Furthermore , a quarantine period varies all over the world . It is unclear whether the 14 - day quarantine is sufficient to protect against the international spread of COVID - 19 . There is evidence that the maximum inter - val between entering mainland China and diagnosis for imported COVID - 19 cases is 23 days 22 .

Therefore , in this study , we provide direct estimates of the optimal quarantine period for international travelers , based on the interval between the date of arrival and the date of confirmation of imported COVID - 19 cases in Chengdu , China . We also evaluate the effectiveness of Customs screening at detecting inter - national travelers infected with SARS - CoV - 2 , which has significant implications for quarantine and isolation of international travelers in the future . Results Demographic characteristics of COVID‑19 cases . Among the 491 imported COVID - 19 cases ( Table 1 ) , 194 cases were asymptomatic ( 39 . 5 % ) , 114 cases were presymptomatic ( 23 . 2 % ) , 183 cases were symp - tomatic ( 37 . 3 % ) . The mean age of the cases was 35 . 6 years ( SD = 12 . 1 ) . 409 cases were men ( 83 . 3 % ) , 82 cases were women ( 16 . 7 % ) . Most cases were workers ( 189 , 38 . 5 % ) , from Asia ( 266 , 54 . 2 % ) . More than half ( 283 , 57 . 6 % ) came to Chengdu , China in autumn ( September to November ) . The majority ( 364 , 74 . 1 % ) of cases were screened positive for SARS - CoV - 2 , conducted by Chengdu Customs District , the People’s Republic of China . Compared with presymptomatic or symptomatic cases , asymptomatic cases had a lower mean age ( P < 0 . 001 ) . There was no sex or occupation difference across different stages of infections ( P > 0 . 05 ) , whereas an imported continent dif - ference and seasonal difference were observed ( P = 0 . 007 , Fisher’s exact test ; P = 0 . 025 ) . The proportion of cases screened positive by Customs quarantine was slightly different ( P = 0 . 043 ) , while pairwise comparisons between the stages of infections showed no statistical difference ( P > 0 . 05 ) . Time to confirmation . The cumulative distribution of time to confirmation , defined as the time between the date of arriving in Chengdu and the date of confirmation of COVID - 19 by PT - PCR , is shown in Fig . 1 . Among 491 cases , 95 % were confirmed by PT - PCR within 14 days ( 95 % CI 13 – 15 ) after arriving in Chengdu . For different stages of infections ( Fig . 2A ) , 95 % of asymptomatic cases were confirmed by PT - PCR within 15 days ( 13 – 16 ) after arrival , 95 % of presymptomatic cases were confirmed by PT - PCR within 13 days ( 13 – 13 ) after arrival , 95 % of symptomatic cases were confirmed by PT - PCR within 14 days ( 13 – 17 ) after arrival . Furthermore , 95 % of male cases were confirmed by PT - PCR within 14 days ( 13 – 15 ) after arrival , 95 % of female cases were confirmed by PT - PCR within 14 days ( 12 – 16 ) after arrival ( Fig . 2B ) .

Table 2 shows the results of the univariable and mul - tivariable regression model analyses for factors associated with the time to confirmation of imported COVID - 19 cases . The univariable analysis of confirmation time shows that symptomatic patients had a short time to confirmation compared to asymptomatic infections ( OR = 1 . 62 ; 95 % CI = 1 . 03 – 2 . 57 ) . This association was fur - ther supported by multivariable analyses and was not affected by potential confounding factors ( OR = 1 . 87 ; 95 % CI = 1 . 15 – 3 . 07 ) . We did not observe any additional associated factors . Discussion This analysis of imported COVID - 19 cases in Chengdu , China , provides insight into formulating a rationale for determining the optimal quarantine period for international travelers . The values estimated provide the evi - dentiary foundation for containing the international spread of COVID - 19 . Analyses of the interval between the Figure 1 .

The upper confidence limit for female cases and presymptomatic cases are not available and estimated using the 95th quantile and corresponding lower confidence limit . 4 Vol : . ( 1234567890 ) Scientific Reports | ( 2022 ) 12 : 21132 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41598 - 022 - 20712 - 8 www . nature . com / scientificreports / date of arrival and the date of confirmation of imported COVID - 19 cases revealed that at least 5 % of incubation periods could be longer than 14 days . These results paint a positive picture of the impact of obligatory household quarantine for 14 days in Chengdu . Public health authorities may consider a slight extension of the quarantine period to deal with uncertainty in the incubation periods . All ages of the population are susceptible to SARS - CoV - 2 infection , younger adults who contracted SARS - CoV - 2 are more likely to be asymptomatic or have mild diseases 23 – 25 . We found that asymptomatic cases were younger than presymptomatic or symptomatic cases . The age - dependent T - cell and B - cell dysfunction and differential expression of inflammatory genes could lead to immune dysregulation and induce more prolonged proinflammatory responses , potentially contributing to poor outcomes 26 – 28 . This work further supports a high prevalence of asymptomatic cases in SARS - CoV - 2 infections 22 , 29 , 30 . 39 . 5 % of international travelers infected with SARS - CoV - 2 remains asymptomatic , which is lower than the range reported for SARS - CoV - 2 ( 40 – 45 % ) 30 . Asymptomatic international travelers will be missed by symptom - based surveillance 31 , even if screened for SARS - CoV - 2 . Furthermore , only 74 . 1 % of imported COVID - 19 cases were timely found by Customs quarantine . It is crucial to implement the travel quarantine for international travelers during the COVID - 19 pandemic . Our estimation of the 95th quantile of the interval between the date of arrival and the date of confirmation , 14 days , supports the adopted mandatory quarantine period of 14 days in China 19 . Of note , we estimated that about 5 . 0 % of imported COVID - 19 cases would not have a positive SARS - CoV - 2 RT - PCR array until 14 days after arriving in Chengdu . Similarly , previous work had suggested that at least 5 % of cases would take 14 days or more to develop symptoms 19 – 21 . In particular , asymptomatic cases can transmit SARS - CoV - 2 to others for longer than 14 days 30 . It has appeared several COVID - 19 outbreaks in China due to international imported COVID - 19 cases 32 . Consequently , the 14 - day household quarantine was recommended to international travelers discharged from a designated centralized quarantine site for 14 days in Chengdu . Besides , we found that symptomatic patients had a short time to confirmation of SARS - CoV - 2 compared to asymptomatic infections , which be accountable for that the symptomatic individuals had a significantly higher peak mean viral load than the asymptomatic SARS - CoV - 2 infections 33 . A prior study also found nationality , the interval between entering and detection of positive results , the results of initial nucleic acid detection were critical factors for time to confirmation 22 . Policy makers should take into account these important factors . Our study has several limitations . First , international travelers arriving in Chengdu might be a biased sample due to the airline control measures implemented by the Civil Aviation Administration of China . Second , we could not estimate the incubation period distribution of imported COVID - 19 cases since the possible exposure time of imported COVID - 19 cases was not available . Third , a minority of international travelers who arrived in December 2020 received COVID - 19 vaccines , so we could not evaluate the impact of the vaccines . Although vaccination is effective and safe against COVID - 19 34 , 35 , the vaccinated population may contract SARS - CoV - 2 Table 2 .

Moreover , we could not assess the true transmissibility of imported cases with an extended incubation period , longer than 14 days . A longitudinal study should be carried out to investigate the infectious period of COVID - 19 or how long infected individuals remain infectious to others , which is associated with release from quarantine . Finally , the virus mutation may markedly change the transmissivity and severity of SARS - Cov - 2 , causing the quarantine policy adjustment , and future studies should take into consideration dif - ferent SARS - Cov - 2 variants . Conclusions The high prevalence of asymptomatic infection and the long incubation period have made it challenging to contain the COVID - 19 pandemic . To ensure non - infection with a 95 % probability , public health authorities should quarantine international travelers for more than 14 days . Also , policymakers may consider an obliga - tory household quarantine or household health monitoring after a 14 - day designated centralized quarantine , to minimize the negative consequences of the COVID - 19 confinement and prevent the international spread of COVID - 19 . Nevertheless , the government should consider the balance between COVID - 19 and socioeconomic development , which may cause more serious social and health crises . Methods Source of data . A retrospective observational study of the imported laboratory - confirmed COVID - 19 cases from March 2020 to December 2020 was performed . All international travelers , arriving in Chengdu , should be screened for SARS - CoV - 2 , shortly conducted by Chengdu Customs District , the People’s Republic of China . Confirmations of COVID - 19 cases were done at the Chengdu Center for Disease Control and Preven - tion , using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) assays targeting two different regions of the RdRp gene in SARS - CoV - 2 . All methods were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines . All experi - ments were carried out in the Laboratory of Chengdu Center for Disease Control and Prevention . Regardless of symptoms , all international travelers should comply with a centralized isolated medical quarantine for 14 days and household quarantine for 14 days in Chengdu . Basic demographic information and time from arrival to confirmation by RT - PCR were recorded for all confirmed cases . We excluded 2 imported COVID - 19 cases who received a centralized isolated medical quarantine in the other city , subsequently arrived in Chengdu , and were confirmed by RT - PCR . Hence , we included 491 cases in the study . Case definitions . COVID - 19 cases were divided into asymptomatic , presymptomatic , and symptomatic cases . Asymptomatic cases were defined as being confirmed by RT - PCR without any symptoms whatsoever for the duration of infection ( e . g . , fever , cough , anosmia , and lung changes ) . Presymptomatic cases were defined as being confirmed by RT - PCR , prior to the onset of symptoms . Symptomatic cases were defined as being con - firmed by RT - PCR and the development of symptoms . Time to confirmation . In this study , “time to confirmation” was defined as the interval in days between the date of arriving in Chengdu and the date of confirmation of COVID - 19 by PT - PCR . Statistical analysis . Age was present as mean with standard deviation ( SD ) , which was subject to normal distribution . We performed the Shapiro – Wilk test of normality and computed Levene’s test for homogeneity of variance across the stages of infections ( package = “car” , version = “3 . 0 – 11” ) . In this study , the variance was tested to be not equal . We used an approximate method of Welch 39 to compare age according to the stages of infections , which generalizes the commonly known 2 - sample Welch test to the case of arbitrarily many samples . Pairwise comparisons between the stages of infections were calculated with the Bonferroni corrections for multiple testing ( package = “stats” , version = “4 . 1 . 0” ) . Sex , occupation , imported continent , season at the entry , Customs quaran - tine were presented as absolute numbers with the percentage . Chi - square tests and Fisher’s exact tests were used to compare the difference according to the stages of infections ( package = “gmodels” , version = “2 . 18 . 1” ; pack - age = “rcompanion” , version = “2 . 4 . 1” ) . Time between arrival and confirmation was estimated by the use of non - parametric survival methods . The 95th quantile of time to be confirmation and corresponding 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) were computed ( package = “survival” , version = “3 . 2 – 11” ; package = “survminer” , version = “0 . 4 . 9” ) . A univariable logistic regression model and a multivariable logistic regression model were used to estimate the odds ratios and 95 % confidence interval to explore the factors associated with time to confirmation of imported COVID - 19 cases in Chengdu , China ( package = “stats” , version = “4 . 1 . 0” ) . The outcome was defined as whether the time to confirmation was below one day , that is , immediately screened positive for SARS - CoV - 2 , conducted by Chengdu Customs District , the People’s Republic of China . All analyses were performed using R version 4 . 0 . 4 ( R Foundation for Statistical Computing ) . A P value ( P < 0 . 05 ) was used to define statistical significance . Ethical approval . Data collection was determined by the Article 7 , 12 , 48 , Law of the People’s Republic of China on Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases to be part of the epidemiological investigation of a notifiable infectious disease and therefore the individual informed consent was waived . Partial data was avail - able from the official website of Chengdu Municipal Health Commission ( http : / / cdwjw . cheng du . gov . cn / cdwjw / c1356 32 / yqbd . shtml ) .
