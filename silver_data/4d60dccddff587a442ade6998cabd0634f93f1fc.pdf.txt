The cortex is held far from equilibrium by both active stresses and turnover : Myosin - II molecular motors drive deformations required for cell division , migration , and tissue morphogenesis , while turnover of the molecular components of the actin cortex relax stress and facilitate network reorganization . While many aspects of F - actin network viscoelasticity are well - characterized in the presence and absence of motor activity , a mechanistic understanding of how non - equilibrium actin turnover contributes to stress relaxation is still lacking . To address this , we developed a reconstituted in vitro system wherein the steady - state length and turnover rate of F - actin in entangled solutions are controlled by the actin regulatory proteins cofilin , profilin , and formin , which sever , recycle , and nucleate filaments , respectively . Cofilin - mediated severing accelerates the turnover and spatial reorganization of F - actin , without significant changes to filament length . Microrheology measurements demonstrate that cofilin - mediated severing is a single - timescale mode of stress relaxation that tunes the low - frequency viscosity over two orders of magnitude . These findings serve as the foundation for understanding the mechanics of more physiological F - actin networks with turnover , and inform an updated microscopic model of single - filament turnover . They also demonstrate that polymer activity , in the form of ATP hydrolysis on F - actin coupled to nucleotide - dependent cofilin binding , is sufficient to generate a form of active matter wherein asymmetric filament disassembly preserves filament number in spite of sustained severing . Significance Statement : When an animal cell moves or divides , a disordered network of actin filaments ( F - actin ) plays a central role in controlling the resulting changes in cell shape . While it is known that continual turnover of F - actin by cofilin - mediated severing aids in reorganization of the cellular cytoskeleton , it is unclear how the turnover of structural elements alters the mechanical properties of the network . Here we show that severing of F - actin by cofilin results in a stress relaxation mechanism in entangled solutions characterized by a single - timescale set by the severing rate . Additionally , we identify ATP hydrolysis and nucleotide - dependent cofilin binding as sufficient ingredients to generate a non - equilibrium steady - state in which asymmetric F - actin disassembly preserves filament number in spite of sustained severing . peer - reviewed ) is the author / funder .

More than 100 actin - binding proteins control the formation and differential regulation of F - actin networks , yielding architectures and turnover rates tuned for specific cellular processes ( Pollard , 2016 ) . Accordingly , the actin cortex , a thin and approximately isotropic F - actin meshwork anchored just beneath the plasma membrane is thought to be the primary determinant of cell shape and mechanics ( Clark et al . , 2013 ; Salbreux et al . , 2012 ) . In vivo measurements place cortical actin turnover on the 10 - 100 s timescale ( Fritzsche et al . , 2013 ; Robin et al . , 2014 ) , and while turnover is known to modulate cortical tension ( Tinevez et al . , 2009 ) and flows ( Bray and White , 1988 ) , a mechanistic understanding of how turnover regulates cortical mechanics is currently lacking . Rheological measurements of F - actin networks reconstituted with purified proteins provide significant insight into the mechanics of living cells by enabling architectural and compositional control , and are sufficient to capture aspects of cellular mechanical response ( Gardel et al . , 2006 ) . Guided by decades of reconstitution experiments , a quantitative theoretical understanding has emerged for how static microscopic parameters like filament density , length , and stiffness contribute to the viscoelastic mechanics of entangled F - actin solutions ( Morse , 1998a , 1998b ) and cross - linked F - actin networks ( Broedersz and MacKintosh , 2014 ) . Suppression of filament bending fluctuations by entanglements or cross - links transiently stores stress energy , giving rise to elasticity on the timescale of seconds . Diffusive , snake - like reptation of filaments ( in entangled solutions ) or cross - link unbinding ( in networks ) sets the timescale for stress relaxation , t relax . While the response of networks on timescales longer than t relax is complicated by a broad spectrum of timescales related to the unbinding of multiple cross - links ( Broedersz et al . , 2010 ) , relaxation is expected to be nearly Maxwellian in entangled solutions , with response dominated by a simple viscosity ( Isambert and Maggs , 1996 ; Morse , 1998a ) . However , the contribution of dynamic F - actin turnover to stress relaxation remains largely unknown . F - actin turnover requires sequential disassembly , nucleotide exchange , and assembly , and is limited in vitro primarily by slow disassembly kinetics ( Brieher , 2013 ; Pollard , 1986 ) . However , all of these reactions are tightly regulated in vivo , with the actin - binding proteins cofilin and profilin playing particularly important roles ( Bugyi and Carlier , 2010 ; Pollard et al . , 2000 ) . Cofilin binds cooperatively ( De La Cruz , 2005 ) and preferentially ( Blanchoin and Pollard , 1999 ; Carlier et al . , 1997 ) to ADP - F - actin , allosterically accelerates release of inorganic phosphate ( Blanchoin and Pollard , 1999 ; Carlier et al . , 1997 ; Suarez et al . , 2011 ) , and severs filaments at boundaries between clusters of cofilin - bound and - unbound subunits ( De La Cruz , 2009 ; McCullough et al . , peer - reviewed ) is the author / funder .

Profilin , in turn , competes with cofilin for binding to ADP - bound monomers ( Blanchoin and Pollard , 1998 ) , catalyzes exchange of ADP for ATP ( Mockrin and Korn , 1980 ) , blocks assembly at pointed - ends ( Pollard and Cooper , 1984 ; Tilney et al . , 1983 ) , and promotes the rapid elongation of barbed - ends by formin proteins ( Goode and Eck , 2007 ) , which are responsible for generating the long cortical filaments important for mechanics in living cells ( Fritzsche et al . , 2016 ) . Here , we use purified cofilin , profilin , and formin to reconstitute rapid F - actin turnover at steady - state . We then combine filament - level measurements of length and turnover rate with fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) and microrheology to systematically study the impact of non - equilibrium turnover on the dynamics and mechanics of entangled actin filament solutions in vitro . The choice of entangled solutions enables a quantitative assessment of stress relaxation mechanisms . Our work lays the foundation for elucidating the influence of F - actin turnover on the mechanics of more physiological network architectures . Results Independent control of F - actin length and turnover at steady - state in vitro . Nucleotide hydrolysis is intimately coupled to actin polymer dynamics , as shown in Fig . 1A . Upon incorporation into filaments , ATP - bound globular actin ( ATP - G - actin ) monomers undergo a conformational change , becoming ATP - F - actin . ATP is rapidly and stochastically hydrolyzed on the filament ( JÃ©gou et al . , 2011 ; Korn et al . , 1987 ) , converting ATP - F - actin to ADP - Pi - F - actin ( orange ) . The inorganic phosphate ( P i ) is subsequently released on a much slower timescale ( 300 - 500 s ) ( Blanchoin and Pollard , 1999 ; Melki et al . , 1996 ) , resulting in ADP - F - actin ( yellow ) . ADP - F - actin converts to ADP - G - actin upon dissociation from the filament , and the cycle is completed by exchange of the bound ADP nucleotide with free ATP in solution . Importantly , it is the effective irreversibility of the ATP - hydrolysis step which confers non - equilibrium dynamics to this set of coupled reactions , generating a directed turnover cycle with a steady - state flux of monomers . Monitoring the production of P i in solution with a coupled - enzyme reaction gives a direct measure of bulk turnover ( Webb , 1992 ) . F - actin turnover is regulated in part by the actin binding proteins profilin and cofilin ( Fig . 1B ) ( Blanchoin and Pollard , 1999 ; Carlier et al . , 1997 ; Didry et al . , 1998 ) . We measured turnover ( inorganic phosphate ( P i ) production ; Fig . 1C ) in solutions assembled from 1 . 5 ÂµM Mg - ATP - actin alone ( gray trace ) , or copolymerized with either 4 . 5 ÂµM profilin ( mole ratio profilin : actin = R p = 3 , blue ) , 0 . 75 ÂµM cofilin ( R c = 0 . 5 , purple ) , or 4 . 5 ÂµM profilin and 0 . 75 ÂµM cofilin ( R p = 3 and R c = 0 . 5 , red ) . All traces are initially non - linear as actin is assembled , but become linear once steady - state is reached ( Fig . 1C , Fig . S1 ) . Measurements of steady - state P i production ( 180 - 240 min after initiation of polymerization ) indicate that a molar excess of profilin : actin ( Rp = 3 ) is sufficient to increase the bulk turnover rate ~ 3 - fold over actin alone ( Fig 1D ) .

To extract how profilin and cofilin affect the turnover rate of individual filaments , we first determined the number of filaments in solution from a variant on the seeded pyrene - actin assembly assay ( Fig . 1E - F , SI Methods ) . Briefly , unlabeled actin is assembled in the presence of regulatory proteins and allowed to reach steady - state . Fluorescent pyrene - actin is then added , and , as in traditional seeded assays , the initial rate of the fluorescence increase is proportional to the number of elongating filaments present ( Higgs et al . , 1999 ) . Consistent with its role in inhibiting spontaneous nucleation ( Pollard et al . , 2000 ) , profilin ( R p = 3 ) reduces the filament concentration at steady - state ~ 5 - fold ( Fig . 1B , E , F ) . By contrast , cofilin ( R c = 0 . 5 ) increases the filament concentration ~ 2 - fold , qualitatively consistent with its severing activity ( De La Cruz , 2009 ) ( Fig . 1B , E , F ) . In the presence of both profilin and cofilin , the filament concentration is comparable to that for actin alone . By dividing the bulk phosphate release rate by the filament density , we obtain the turnover rate for individual filaments ( Fig . 1G ) . We find that profilin and cofilin are each sufficient to increase the turnover rate of actin ~ 15 - fold , from 0 . 14 to ~ 2 . 0 subunits / filament / sec . In the presence of both profilin and cofilin , turnover increases further to ~ 3 . 1 subunits / filament / sec , qualitatively consistent with previous results ( Didry et al . , 1998 ) . Taken together , these data demonstrate that the combination of profilin and cofilin increases the turnover rate of individual actin filaments ~ 22 - fold . Filament length is controlled by varying the filament nucleation rate through changes in the concentration of the formin mDia1 , which nucleates ( Li and Higgs , 2003 ) and processively elongates ( Kovar et al . , 2006 ; Romero et al . , 2004 ) actin filaments ( Fig . 1B ) . Fluorescence imaging revealed that , for fixed concentrations of actin and profilin , the mean filament length at steady - state can be varied from 21 to 3 Âµm by increasing the formin concentration from 0 to ~ 1 ÂµM ( Fig S2 ) . Remarkably , the presence of the severing protein cofilin has little affect on the steady - state length distribution in the presence of profilin and formin ( Fig . 1H ) . Indeed , 11 . 9 ÂµM Mg - ATP - actin polymerized in the presence of profilin ( R p = 3 , 35 . 7 ÂµM ) and formin ( R f = 0 . 01 , 119 nM ) without ( R c = 0 , blue ) or with cofilin ( R c = 0 . 5 , 5 . 95 ÂµM , red ) have very similar length distributions with mean lengths of 3 . 1 Âµm without cofilin and 3 . 7 Âµm in the presence of cofilin . Together these data demonstrate that nucleation during assembly sets the steady - state F - actin length distribution nearly independent of cofilin - mediated severing and increased filament turnover dynamics . peer - reviewed ) is the author / funder .

To explore the consequences of severing and turnover on the dynamic redistribution of F - actin , we performed steady - state Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching ( FRAP ) measurements on entangled solutions of 11 . 9 ÂµM actin ( 5 % Oregon Green - actin ) assembled with a constant molar excess of profilin ( R p = 3 ) and a range of cofilin and formin concentrations . At this actin concentration , the expected distance between actin filaments is ~ 420 nm , yielding spatially uniform actin fluorescence prior to bleaching ( Fig . 2A ) . The post - bleach recovery of actin fluorescence we observe is qualitatively described by two phases : a relatively rapid recovery in the first ~ 60 s , and a much slower recovery thereafter ( Fig . 2B ) . In the absence of cofilin , the average fluorescence intensity of the bleached region recovers to approximately 8 % of the pre - bleach value within 65 seconds , and then only to 12 % after 545 seconds ( blue ) . By contrast , the recovery is much more rapid in the presence of cofilin ( Fig . 2A - B , red ) , reaching approximately 40 % in 65 seconds and more than 60 % by 545 seconds for R c = 0 . 5 . Changes in the diffusivity of monomers or filaments are insufficient to fully account for this recovery profile , since the presence of cofilin increases the size of the monomer pool from ~ 1 % to only ~ 9 % total actin ( SI Text ) , and cofilin doesn ' t reduce the mean filament length ( Fig . 1H ) . Instead , we interpret the pronounced recovery enhancement at early times as resulting primarily from accelerated F - actin turnover ( Fig . 1G ) , where the rates at which unbleached subunits are incorporated and bleached subunits are removed from existing filaments are elevated through the action of cofilin . The degree of actin fluorescence recovery 65 - seconds after bleaching is sensitively tuned by cofilin ( Fig . 2C ) , with a maximal increase of ~ 5 - fold . Interestingly , on this timescale , we find comparable cofilin - dependent recovery for samples with different concentrations of formin ( black squares and red circle ) . Since the mean length is expected to differ by a factor of 2 between these formin concentrations ( SI Text ) , the near independence of the fluorescence recovery to formin concentration supports that notion that filament diffusion plays a minimal role in the recovery on this timescale . The slow diffusion of long filaments is likely responsible for the incomplete recovery after 545 s observed in all cases , however . Taken together , these data demonstrate that in vitro F - actin turnover , catalyzed by cofilin and relying on monomer diffusion , is the dominant process controlling the steady - state reorganization of F - actin on the timescale of 10s of seconds . Cofilin fluidizes entangled F - actin solutions . We employ microrheology to measure the frequency - dependent viscoelasticity of entangled F - actin solutions with varying concentrations of cofilin at steady - state . 11 . 9 ÂµM Mg - ATP - Actin is assembled with the desired concentrations of profilin , formin , cofilin , and 1 - Âµm diameter fluorescent polystyrene beads for 95 minutes to reach steady - state ( Fig .

In the presence of saturating profilin ( R p = 3 ) and moderate formin ( R f = 0 . 1 ) , but the absence of cofilin , bead MSDs are characteristic of that observed in semi - dilute , entangled F - actin solutions ( Fig . 3A , blue ) . For times less than 0 . 3 s , the time - dependence of the MSD arises from bending fluctuations of individual F - actin ( Amblard et al . , 1996 ; Broedersz and MacKintosh , 2014 ) . At longer times , the MSD approaches a plateau value that reflects the local elastic modulus ( Gardel et al . , 2003 ) . The local viscoelasticity can be measured by using the Generalized Stokes - Einstein Relationship to obtain the frequency - dependent elastic , Gâ , and viscous , Gâ , moduli ( Gardel et al . , 2003 ; Gittes et al . , 1997 ; Squires and Mason , 2010 ) . The elastic modulus is nearly constant and much larger than the viscous modulus at frequencies between ~ 1 Hz and 0 . 01 Hz . This is indicative of a material that is predominantly elastic over this frequency regime , consistent with previous measurements on entangled F - actin solutions ( Gardel et al . , 2003 ; Liu et al . , 2006 ) . Increasing concentrations of cofilin raises the magnitude and modifies the time - dependence of the MSD . The plateau in the MSD is truncated by the emergence of a gradual upturn at lag times greater than 10 s for R c = 0 . 1 ( Fig 3A , cyan ) . The location of the upturn shifts toward shorter lag times as R c increases , with the MSD approaching diffusive scaling ( ~ t 1 . 0 ) at the longest lag times for R c = 0 . 5 . This increased bead mobility reflects dramatic changes in the local viscoelasticity ( Fig . 3B ) . At moderate cofilin concentration ( R c = 0 . 1 , cyan ) , the elastic modulus systematically decays from 1 to 0 . 01 Hz , resulting in a low frequency crossover where , presumably , the viscous modulus becomes dominant at frequencies below 0 . 1 Hz . At higher cofilin concentrations ( R c = 0 . 5 ) , the elastic and viscous modulus are similar in magnitude and decay with time . A parameterization of the frequency - dependent viscoelasticity is the phase angle Î¦ , or arc tangent of the ratio Gâ / Gâ , and would be 0Âº and 90Âº for purely elastic and viscous materials , respectively , at a given frequency . Calculating Î¦ at 0 . 1 Hz , we find that it increases from 10Âº to 60Âº as the cofilin concentration is increased from R c = 0 to R c = 1 ( Fig . 3C ) . Thus , increased cofilin concentration results in a transition between a viscoelastic solid to a viscoelastic fluid . Since cofilin is not reducing the mean filament length ( Fig 1H ) , and since the steady - state monomer pool is not increased sufficiently to increase the mesh size beyond the radius of the bead ( SI text ) , the fluidization likely results from elevated actin filament turnover . To explore how the fluidity of actin solutions can be regulated by changes to filament length and turnover dynamics , we measure Î¦ at 0 . 1 Hz over a range of cofilin and formin concentrations ( Fig . 3D ) . For all filament lengths ( formin concentrations ) examined , the addition of sufficient cofilin increases the phase angle . The most fluid - like samples are those with short filaments ( highest formin concentration ) undergoing rapid turnover ( high cofilin concentration ) . Interestingly , for the longest filaments , we see a hint that the phase angle a biphasic function of cofilin concentration , peaking near R c = peer - reviewed ) is the author / funder .

While fluidization of entangled F - actin solutions by shortening the steady - state filament length has been previously appreciated ( Gardel et al . , 2003 ) , we demonstrate here that by accelerating steady - state turnover , fluidization can also be achieved without reducing the average length of filaments . Rapid cofilin - mediated turnover is a single - timescale mode of stress relaxation . To compare the mechanism of enhanced fluidity that arises from accelerated filament turnover to shortened filament length , we compare the MSD of microscopically distinct F - actin solutions that have identical values of Î¦ at 0 . 1 Hz ( Fig . 4A ) . Specifically , we compare samples with long filaments and fast turnover ( purple , red ) to one with short filaments and slow turnover ( black ) . Interestingly , these samples are rheologically indistinguishable at all timescales probed . Thus , an entangled solution of relatively long filaments undergoing rapid turnover ( purple ) is mechanically equivalent to a solution of relatively short , stable filaments ( black ) . Notably , such global equivalence in the mechanical response requires equivalence in the long - timescale relaxation dynamics , despite the differences in underlying microscopic processes . Since the stress relaxation of entangled solutions is dominated by a single timescale ( Morse , 1998b ) , we infer that the enhanced relaxation resulting from cofilin - mediated actin turnover is also a single - timescale process . In a manner analogous to time - temperature superposition ( Ferry , 1980 ; Tobolsky , 1956 ) , we estimate the relaxation timescale for individual F - actin solutions by rescaling the measured MSDs by a shift - factor b , and the separation time ât by a shift - factor a , such that the long - time behavior superposes with that of a single reference sample composed of relatively short filaments in the absence of cofilin ( black , Fig . 4A - B ) , for which the relaxation time , , could be directly inferred from the low - frequency crossover of G ' and G " ( Fig . S5 ) . The estimated relaxation timescale for each sample i is then given by . The successful superposition of the long - timescale MSDs for entangled solutions with a wide variety of filament lengths and cofilin concentrations ( Fig . 4B ) validates the use of this approach . We examine the dependence of the relaxation time on filament length , which is controlled by tuning the formin concentration . Absolute values of the mean filament length are inferred from a mathematical model which incorporates formin concentration and nucleation rate constants extracted from spontaneous assembly measurements ( SI Text ) . In the absence of cofilin , the increase in relaxation time as a function of L is consistent with L 3 ( Fig . 4C , blue ) . This scaling is that predicted for stress relaxation via reptation ( Doi and Edwards , 1986 ) , roughly the time it takes a filament to diffuse its own length . This is the mechanism of stress - relaxation in entangled actin solutions ( Isambert and Maggs , 1996 ; Morse , 1998a , 1998b ) .

This indicates that cofilin - mediated turnover accelerates stress relaxation in entangled solutions by a mechanism distinct from reptation . Taken together , these data demonstrate that cofilin - meditated turnover results in a single - timescale mode of stress relaxation that can dominate over filament reptation . We explore how changing the severing rate can modulate the stress relaxation time . As the cofilin molar ratio is increased from 0 . 05 to 0 . 15 ( towards the optimal concentration ) , we see that the relaxation time decreases nearly ~ 200 - fold from 600 s to ~ 3 s ( Fig 4D ) . As the cofilin ratio is increased further to 1 , the relaxation time increases back to ~ 1000 s . This biphasic dependence of stress relaxation time on cofilin concentration is qualitatively consistent with the biphasic dependence of severing rate on cofilin binding density ( Andrianantoandro and Pollard , 2006 ; De La Cruz , 2005 , 2009 ; Suarez et al . , 2011 ) ( Fig 4D , dashed line ) . Importantly , this data underscores how non - equilibrium severing activity can decouple mechanical stress relaxation from material structure , as all of these samples contain actin filaments at the same density and nearly the same length . To understand the mechanism of cofilin - mediated stress relaxation observed in Fig . 4C and D , we explore a simple physical model which explicitly incorporates filament severing , and which captures the weak dependence of the relaxation time on filament length . Assuming an initial steady - state length distribution SSL P , we approximate the residual stress at time t following application of a step strain as proportional to the residual polymer of length exceeding the entanglement length L e : . The distribution of residual length evolves according to ï¨ ï© 1 1 2 d L s L L M dt M P k L P P ï¥ ï« ï½ ï© ï¹ ï½ ï­ ï­ ï« ï« ï» ï¥ due to severing alone at a rate k s and neglecting depolymerization , which represents a valid approximation for large lengths L and M . This time evolution is analogous to that used previously to describe the rheology of worm - like micelles ( Cates , 1987 ) , but neglecting filament annealing reactions , which should be suppressed here by depolymerization and formins ( Kovar et al . , 2003 ) . We emphasize that represents the distribution of " stressed " filaments , and not the instantaneous filament length distribution SSL P , which differs due to depolymerization that leads to stress - free elongation . This model is exactly solvable for exponential SSL P ( SI Text ) , and interestingly yields a stress that decays with a characteristic timescale ï¨ ï© 1 relax s e k L ï´ ï­ which depends on polymer density ( through the entanglement length ) but not filament length ( Fig S6 ) . A fit of this length - independent model to the relaxation times measured with cofilin ( Fig . 4C , dashed line ) predicts a severing rate of ~ 3 . 3 x 10 - 4 events / sub / s at optimal concentrations .

Including depolymerization in the evolution of P L could further reduce this discrepancy , and likely contributes to the differences in Fig . 4D . Interestingly , one can define a lengthscale disassembly ~ / d s L k k at which the time between severing events is comparable to the time for depolymerization of fragments of length d L . If this length exceeds the entanglement length , then the rate of stress relaxation is expected to increase by a factor of ~ / d e L L . Elucidation of the role of this lengthscale in the dynamics of stress relaxation is currently under way . Taken together , however , these modeling results support severing as a crucial ingredient for the weak dependence of mechanical relaxation on filament length . Discussion Here we show that cofilin - mediated turnover tunes the steady - state fluidity of entangled solutions of F - actin . In the presence of formin and profilin , cofilin - mediated severing does not reduce the mean filament length or number density at steady - state , factors known to control mechanics and filament mobility . Instead , the enhanced fluidity arises from non - equilibrium actin turnover catalyzed by cofilin severing . Our work provides a new microscopic model of how a steady - state length is achieved in the presence of cofilin activity ( Fig . 5 ) . The textbook view of actin turnover is treadmilling , wherein barbed - end elongation proceeds at the turnover rate , and is exactly balanced at steady - state by pointed - end disassembly ( Phillips et al . , 2008 ) . A treadmilling - based mechanism predicts that the relaxation time would be linear in L , which is the strongest dependence with which our data is reasonably consistent ( Fig . 4D ) . However , the 8 nm / s treadmilling velocity we obtain from turnover measurements is too slow by more than 100 - fold to account for the relaxation times we estimate ( Fig . 4D ) . Instead , non - equilibrium ATP hydrolysis directs cofilin severing and enables asymmetric kinetics for both assembly and disassembly of severed fragments ( Fig . 5C ) . Cofilin binds with an ~ 40 - fold higher affinity to ADP - F - actin than either ADP - Pi - or ATP - actin ( Blanchoin and Pollard , 1998 ; Carlier et al . , 1997 ) , preferentially localizing both binding and severing away from the filament barbed ( McCullough et al . , 2011 ; Suarez et al . , 2011 ) . Importantly , the two fragments formed upon filament severing differ in their nucleotide composition . The fragment with the newly - created barbed end is ADP - rich throughout , resulting in its rapid disassembly from both pointed and barbed ends , at a combined rate on the order of ~ 0 . 1 Âµm / s ( SI Text ) . In contrast , the fragment with the pre - existing barbed - end retains an ATP gradient along its length , and is thus stable , independent of the presence of the formin . This stable fragment continues to elongate , and by consuming monomer released through the rapid disassembly of unstable peer - reviewed ) is the author / funder . All rights reserved .

Thus , severing couples to asymmetric ( dis ) assembly dynamics generated by non - equilibrium ATP - hydrolysis to preserve steady - state filament length while catalyzing turnover . The possibility for non - equilibrium effects to fluidize materials is of great interest in understanding active biological materials . The mechanical response of entangled F - actin solutions is typically dominated by filament length and density , and understood in terms of a tube model ( Fig 5A - B ) , wherein stress relaxes by filament reptation . Our results demonstrate that rapid turnover catalyzed by cofilin can fluidize these solutions without major changes to global architecture . The enhanced stress relaxation arises from rapid disassembly of large filament portions , while filament assembly and tube remodeling occur stress - free ( Fig . 5D ) . In contrast to other active processes ( e . g . myosin motors ) , here the non - equilibrium activity primarily effects the dynamical properties of the filament steady - state , enabling rapid ( dis ) assembly with no nucleation and ultimately enhancing stress relaxation , rather than altering local mechanics via generating local forces per say . This suggests that the bead motions are likely still thermally driven , implying that the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( Squires and Mason , 2010 ) is only weakly broken by the non - equilibrium turnover , and validating our use of the Generalized Stokes - Einstein Relation ( Fig . 3 ) . It will be interesting to explore the effects of severing - mediated stress relaxation in more physiological cross - linked networks of F - actin . While saturation of actin networks with cross - linkers ( Schmoller et al . , 2011 ) or the side - binding protein tropomyosin ( Christensen et al . , 2017 ) inhibits disassembly in vitro , consistent with suppression of cofilin binding ( De La Cruz , 2009 ) , more sparsely distributed attachment points give both sufficient space to allow cofilin binding , and actually accelerate severing ( Pavlov et al . , 2007 ) , suggesting an important role for crosslink density in tuning severing and thereby fluidity . Finally , in cells , F - actin turnover has been considered an important mechanism to support the fluidization of the actin cortex on the scale of 1 - 60 s ( Salbreux et al . , 2012 ) , but is mechanistically best understood in the context of protrusive structures like lamellipodia , which facilitate cell motility ( Blanchoin et al . , 2014 ) . Tur nover of polarized lamellipodial networks and listeria comet tails ( Loisel et al . , 1999 ; Theriot and Mitchison , 1991 ) is thought to proceed via a treadmilling array model ( Pollard and Borisy , 2003 ) in which new filaments are continually nucleated near the leading edge , and elongate only briefly before being capped . Following transport away from the membrane by retrograde flow , capped filaments are then disassembled by cofilin and recycled by profilin , giving rise to spatially separated zones of assembly and disassembly . In contrast , a direct consequence of the dynamical regime of actin turnover we describe in the present work , which does not require steady - state filament nucleation , is that assembly and disassembly are spatially uniform . This mechanism may therefore be better - suited for isotropic networks like the cortex compared to polarized ones like the lamellipodia . peer - reviewed ) is the author / funder .

Microscopic model of cofilin - mediated actin turnover and stress relaxation . ( A ) Cartoon of a test filament ( red ) entangled with other filaments ( gray ) in a semi - dilute actin solution . ( B ) Representation of tube model . Entanglements ( black ) between the test chain and background filaments constrain test chain fluctuations to a tube ( black dashed line ) and thereby store stress . The entanglement length is set by solution mesh size ( gray dots ) and filament persistence length . ( C ) Microscopic dynamics of the test filament regulated by cofilin , profilin , and formin . Cofilin binds and severs ADP - rich filament regions , creating unstable ADP - rich filaments which depolymerize from both ends . The additional G - actin is incorporated onto the stable ATP - barbed end , restoring the length lost from severing . ( D ) Tube memory , and thus stress , decays by depolymerization ( maroon ) and tube remodeling ( yellow ) after severing of the test filament and background filaments , respectively . Polymerization ( green ) is stress - free , so newly created tube does not contribute . peer - reviewed ) is the author / funder . All rights reserved . No reuse allowed without permission .
