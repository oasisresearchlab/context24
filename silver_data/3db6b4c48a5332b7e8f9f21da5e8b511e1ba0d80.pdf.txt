Intracellular events linked to EFhd2 , such as membrane protrusion formation , cell adhesion , and BCR signaling , are triggered by the association of EFhd2 and F - actin . We previously reported that Ca 2 þ enhances the F - actin - bundling ability of EFhd2 through maintaining a rigid parallel EFhd2 - homodimer structure . It was also reported that the F - actin - bundling ability of EFhd2 is regulated by a phosphorylation - dependent mechanism . EGF - induced phosphorylation at Ser183 of EFhd2 has been shown to inhibit F - actin - bundling , leading to irregular actin dynamics at the leading edges of cells . However , the underlying mechanism of this inhibition has remained elusive . Here , we report the crystal structure of a phospho - mimicking mutant ( S183E ) of the EFhd2 core domain , where the actin - binding sites are located . Although the overall structure of the phospho - mimicking mutant is similar to the one of the unphosphorylated form , we observed a conformational transition from ordered to disordered structure in the linker region at the C - terminus of the mutant . Based on our structural and biochemical analyses , we suggest that phosphorylation at Ser183 of EFhd2 causes changes in the local conformational dynamics and the surface charge distribution of the actin - binding site , resulting in a re - coordination of the actin - binding sites in the dimer structure and a reduction of F - actin - bundling activity without affecting the F - actin - binding capacity . © 2016 Elsevier Inc .

Introduction Remodeling of the actin network affects the architecture of various cell surface projections that are essential for cell motility and signal transduction , such as ﬁ lopodia , lamellipodia , and ruf ﬂ es [ 1 ] . Many actin - binding proteins participate in the organization of actin cytoskeleton networks through modulation of their activity . Several of these proteins directly affect the movement , adhesion , and division of various cell types by regulating actin organization through a phosphorylation - dependent mechanism . For example , the phosphorylated forms of the Arp2 / 3 complex and moesin were found to be essential for the nucleation of actin ﬁ laments and the formation of microvilli - like structures [ 2 , 3 ] . Phosphorylated actin depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) / co ﬁ lin inhibited the formation of ﬁ lament - barbed ends and lamellipodia protrusions , while the phosphorylation of a - actinin , fascin , and villin reduced their binding af ﬁ nity for actin , resulting in actin reorganization [ 4 e 7 ] . Furthermore , phosphorylation at Ser403 of the headpiece domain of dematin abolished its F - actin - bundling activity [ 8 ] . Crystallo - graphic analyses of phospho - mimicking mutants of fascin ( S39D ) and dematin ( S403E ) revealed that even though phosphorylation of these proteins does not affect their overall structure , it induces local conformational changes that are critical to their actin - binding and Abbreviations : EFhd2 , EF - hand domain - containing protein D2 ; EFhd1 , EF - hand domain - containing protein D1 ; Ta , midpoint aggregation curve - associated tem - perature ; LM , ligand mimic ; RMSD , root - mean - square deviation ; RMSF , root - mean - square ﬂ uctuation . * Corresponding author .

However , the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of actin networks by phosphorylation - dependent manner are still largely unclear . EF - hand domain - containing protein D2 / Swiprosin - 1 ( EFhd2 ) is mainly expressed in the lamellipodia and ﬁ lopodia at the leading edges of mammalian neuronal and immune cells [ 13 e 17 ] . EFhd2 appears in the cytoskeletal fraction with other known cytoskeletal proteins , such as a - actinin , ﬁ lamin , and ezrin , and modulates actin dynamics similarly to phosphorylated gelsolin and Arp2 / 3 . Thus , it was suggested that EFhd2 is involved in the phosphorylation - dependent regulation of actin organization [ 16 e 19 ] . Up to date , several phosphorylation sites have been identi ﬁ ed in human EFhd2 . Phosphorylation at Ser74 , Ser76 , and Tyr83 of EFhd2 by cyclin dependent kinase 1 ( Cdk1 ) mediate the association of EFhd2 with the SH3 domain of Fgr or Lyn in the plasma membrane of B cells to modulate B - cell receptor ( BCR ) signals [ 20 e 25 ] . Moreover , phos - phorylation of EFhd2 at Ser74 by cyclin dependent kinase 5 ( Cdk5 ) is also involved in pathological conditions such as Alzheimer ' s disease , as well as in the reduction of Ca 2 þ binding activity . Furthermore , epithermal growth factor ( EGF ) - induced phosphor - ylation at Ser183 of EFhd2 reportedly causes inhibition of F - actin clustering [ 26 , 27 ] . EFhd2 is highly homologous to other EF - hand containing adaptor proteins such as EFhd1 ( EF - hand domain - containing pro - tein D1 ) / swiprosin - 2 ( EFhd1 ) and allograft in ﬂ ammatory factor 1 ( AIF - 1 ) ( Fig . S1 ) . Although EFhd2 and EFhd1 have similar domain architecture , with the exception of the N - terminus , their cellular functions are different . EFhd2 is a cytoskeleton - associated protein in immune or neuronal cells , whereas EFhd1 modulates apoptosis and differentiation of neuronal and muscle cells through associa - tion with mitochondria [ 25 ] . On the other hand , AIF - 1 has been revealed to perform actin - bundling function in immune cells , in a way similar to that of EFhd2 [ 25 , 28 ] . EFhd2 , EFhd1 , and AIF - 1 are known to be phosphorylated , but the phosphorylation sites are not conserved ( Fig . S1 ) [ 20 e 27 , 29 , 30 ] . Interestingly , EFhd2 is the only protein among these homologous proteins that contains a highly conserved Ser residue ( Ser183 ) in the linker region between the actin - binding sites and the C - terminal coiled coil , whose phos - phorylation reportedly causes inhibition of the F - actin - bundling activity of EFhd2 [ 27 ] . To understand the structural basis of the phosphorylation - dependent regulation of actin - bundling activity , we determined the crystal structure of a phospho - mimicking mutant of the core domain of EFhd2 ( CD EFhd2 S183E ) . Based on the solved structure and the results of biochemical analyses , we propose that phosphory - lation at Ser183 allows the linker region between the actin - binding sites and the C - terminal coiled coil to adopt a ﬂ exible structure ; this change affects actin - bundling activity by altering the coordination of the actin - binding sites in the dimeric structure . These ﬁ ndings provide the ﬁ rst insight into the phosphorylation - dependent mo - lecular mechanism through which EFhd2 modulates actin dynamics . 2 . Materials and methods 2 . 1 . Protein preparation of CD EFhd2 S183E To investigate the role of phosphorylation in the structure of EFhd2 , we created a mutant form of the protein core domain ( a . a 70 e 184 ) in which Ser183 was replaced by Glu ( CD EFhd2 S183E ) . The S183E substitution was created through PCR ( polymerase chain reaction ) site - directed mutagenesis using the following primers : forward , 5 0 - CGCGGATCCGGCGAGCCCCAGTCGCCCAG - 3 0 and ; reve - rse , 5 0 - CCGCTCGAGTTAACTTTCGACGTCGATCTC - 3 0 . CD EFhd2 S183E was cloned into a modi ﬁ ed Novagen pET28a vector ( Merck Milli - pore , Billerica , MA , USA ) containing an N - terminal 6xHis ( His 6 ) - tobacco etch virus ( TEV ) tag . The recombinant DNA was trans - formed into E . coli strain BL21 ( DE3 ) and cells were grown in Luria - Bertani ( LB ) medium at 37 (cid:2) C . Expression of recombinant proteins was induced by adding isopropyl b - D - 1 - thiogalac - topyranoside ( IPTG ) and incubating the cells for an additional 18 h at 20 (cid:2) C . Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 g for 20 min at 4 (cid:2) C . The cell pellet was resuspended in a buffer containing 50 mM HEPES - NaOH ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 300 mM NaCl , 5 mM imidazole , and the cells were disrupted by sonication . After removal of cell debris by centrifugation at 14 , 000 g for 50 min at 4 (cid:2) C , the supernatant was loaded onto an equilibrated gravity - ﬂ ow column ( Bio - Rad , Hercu - les , CA , USA ) packed with Ni - NTA agarose resin ( Peptron , Daejeon , South Korea ) . The protein was eluted with a buffer containing 50 mM HEPES - NaOH ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 300 mM NaCl , and 300 mM imid - azole . The eluate was concentrated , and the resulting protein so - lution was incubated with TEV protease overnight at 4 (cid:2) C to remove the N - terminal His 6 tag . To exchange the buffer for crystallization , the protein solution was passed through a HiLoad 16 / 60 superdex 75 gel ﬁ ltration column ( GE Life Sciences , Marlborough , MA , USA ) , pre - equilibrated with a solution containing 20 mM HEPES - NaOH ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 150 mM NaCl , and 1 mM CaC1 2 . 2 . 2 . Crystallization , data collection , and structure determination Crystals of CD EFhd2 S183E were obtained from a well solution containing 0 . 1 M Tris - HCl ( pH 8 . 5 ) , 20 % ( w / v ) Poly ( ethylene glycol ) methyl ether 2000 ( PEG 2000 MME ) , and 0 . 2 M trimethylamine - N - oxide . All crystals were mounted in cryoloops and cryoprotected by soaking for 10 min in mother liquor containing 15 % ( v / v ) glycerol before ﬂ ash - freezing in a stream of nitrogen gas at (cid:3) 178 (cid:2) C . Data sets were collected on beamline 5C at PLS ( Pohang Accelerator Laboratory , Pohang , South Korea ) to 1 . 86 Å resolution . The crystals belong to the P 2 1 2 1 2 1 space group with cell dimensions of a ¼ 36 . 7 Å , b ¼ 51 . 1 Å , and c ¼ 53 . 6 Å . Raw data integration and scaling were performed with the HKL2000 software package [ 31 ] . Matthews coef ﬁ cient was calculated to be 1 . 8 Å 3 / Da which corre - sponds to a solvent content of 31 . 5 % , assuming that there is one molecule per asymmetric unit [ 32 ] . Initial molecular replacement and automatic model building were performed with AutoMR using the native EFhd2 core domain structure ( PDB : 5I2L ) as the template [ 33 ] . The model was then re ﬁ ned in cyclic rounds of manual model building in COOT followed by automated re ﬁ nement using PHENIX ( Python - based Hierarchical EnviroNment for Integrated Xtallog - raphy ) [ 34 , 35 ] . The structure of CD EFhd2 S183E was re ﬁ ned to R work ¼ 19 . 6 % ( R free ¼ 24 . 6 % ) . Molecular graphics were created us - ing PyMol ( Schr € odinger , New York , NY ) . The data collection and re ﬁ nement statistics are given in Table 1 . 2 . 3 . Ensemble re ﬁ nement of CD EFhd2 and CD EFhd2 S183E To evaluate the conformational dynamics of CD EFhd2 and CD EFhd2 S183E , we performed ensemble re ﬁ nement using PHENIX [ 36 ] . Harmonic restraints were applied for all amino acids with a visible electron density at a level of 1 s in the 2m F o - D F c electron density map using the parameters slack ¼ 1 . 0 and weight ¼ 0 . 001 . 2 . 4 . Protein stability measurement using a thermal aggregation assay To measure the protein stability of CD EFhd2 and CD EFhd2 S183E , the midpoint aggregation curve - associated temperature ( T a ) was determined spectrophotometrically by analyzing a sample of K .

Turbidity was monitored by measuring the absorption at 470 nm at 22 (cid:2) C using an Ultrospec 2000 ultraviolet e visible Spectrometer ( GE Life Sciences ) . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . Crystal structure of CD EFhd2 S183E The structure of CD EFhd2 S183E was solved by the molecular replacement method using the structure of native CD EFhd2 ( PDB : 5I2L ) as a template [ 33 ] and re ﬁ ned to a R work ¼ 19 . 6 % and R free ¼ 24 . 6 % ( Table 1 ) . CD EFhd2 S183E is composed of a PxxP motif , two EF - hands , as well as a ligand mimic ( LM ) - helix at the C - ter - minus where the S183E mutation is located ( Fig . 1A and B ) . Although several residues in the PxxP motif ( residues 70 e 80 ) and the C - terminus linker ( residue 183 , i . e . , the mutation site , and residue 184 ) are missing , the overall structure of CD EFhd2 S183E ﬁ ts very well with that of CD EFhd2 , as the root mean square deviation ( RMSD ) for 102 C a atoms was 0 . 24 Å ( Fig . 1C ) . The linker region ( residues 178 e 184 ) of the native CD EFhd2 was clearly visible in the electron density maps ; its well - ordered structure is de ﬁ ned by a hydrogen bond between Asp181 and Ser183 . However , in the electron density maps of CD EFhd2 S183E , two residues ( Glu183 and Ser184 ) were invisible and were not modeled . This is caused by the increased ﬂ exibility of the C - terminal linker region resulting from the disruption of the aforementioned hydrogen bond , which in turn is a result of the S183E mutation ( Fig . 1C ) . In addition , the com - parison of values of the crystallographic B - factor between native CD EFhd2 and CD EFhd2 S183E showed that the overall B - factor value for CD EFhd2 S183E ( 40 . 4 Å 2 ) was higher than that of the native form ( 20 . 4 Å 2 ) . With respect to speci ﬁ c regions , the linker of CD EFhd2 S183E displayed B - factors remarkably higher than those of the native CD EFhd2 linker ( Fig . 1D ) . 3 . 2 . Structural dynamics of Ser183 phosphorylation Comparison of the solved crystal structure of CD EFhd2 S183E with that of the native form revealed that the mutant displayed an increased ﬂ exibility of the C - terminal linker region , indicating that phosphorylation at Ser183 mediates the transition of the linker region from an ordered to a disordered structure . We performed ensemble re ﬁ nement , which is a useful tool to evaluate structural dynamics based on x - ray data [ 36 ] , to assess the effects of phos - phorylation on the conformational dynamics of CD EFhd2 S183E . Re - sults showed that CD EFhd2 S183E displays a higher B - factor than native CD EFhd2 , indicating that S183 phosphorylation of CD EFhd2 alters the conformation dynamics of the protein ( Fig . 2A and B ) . A signi ﬁ cant increase in root - mean square ﬂ uctuations ( RMSF ) in the C - terminal linker of CD EFhd2 S183E was also observed ( Fig . 2C ) , which is consistent with the results of the crystallographic B - factor analysis ( Fig . 1D ) . Our data suggest that the EFhd2 core domain , which contains the actin - binding sites , forms a local dynamic conformation around the linker region as a result of Ser183 phosphorylation . 3 . 3 . Structural role of Ser183 phosphorylation in the F - actin - bundling function of EFhd2 To investigate the effect of phosphorylation at Ser183 on EFhd2 stability , we measured the protein ' s thermostability using a temperature - induced aggregation assay . Interestingly , we observed that the T a ( midpoint aggregation curve - associated temperature ) of CD EFhd2 S183E was higher ( 93 . 5 (cid:2) C ) than that of native CD EFhd2 ( 84 . 9 (cid:2) C ) ( Fig . 3A ) [ 33 ] . This was contrary to our expectations , as we believed that the hydrophobic C - terminal region ( Leu177 , Ile 180 , and Val 182 ) would be more ﬂ exible and prone to aggregate in CD EFhd2 S183E compared to the native form . This unexpected result can be explained by the surface charge distribution . Our analysis revealed an increase in the negative charge surrounding the LM - helix in CD EFhd2 S183E compared to CD EFhd2 , accompanied by a decrease in the theoretical isoelectric point ( pI ) from 5 . 26 ( CD EFhd2 ) to 5 . 10 ( CD EFhd2 S183E ) ( Fig . 3B and C ) . Based on these results , we postulate that the higher T a value of CD EFhd2 S183E is probably due to an increase in the charge repulsion of the actin - binding sites located in the core domains of the homodimer , which makes the domains more resistant to thermal aggregation . EFhd2 forms parallel homodimers via the interaction of the C - terminal coiled - coil domains ; coordination of the actin - binding sites of the homodimeric core domains is important for the actin - bundling function [ 33 ] . The reduction in actin - bundling activity caused by Ser183 phosphorylation can be explained as a result of a re - orientation of actin - binding sites in the homodimer ( Fig . 4 ) . 4 . Discussion Phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of actin - binding proteins is required for several cytoskeleton - related events . Examples are the nucleation of actin ﬁ laments and modulation of their barbed ends , and formation of membrane protrusions such as microvilli - like structures and lamellipodia [ 2 e 7 ] . Interestingly , EFhd2 is the only protein among its orthologs ( EFhd1 and AIF - 1 ) that contains a highly conserved Ser residue at position 183 , which is known to be phosphorylated ( Fig . S1 ) . Moreover , EGF - induced phosphorylation at this residue was found to inhibit the F - actin clustering activity of Table 1 Data collection and re ﬁ nement statistics .

In the current study , we observed that the phospho - mimicking mutant , CD EFhd2 S183E , displayed increased ﬂ exibility and thermostability compared to the native form , despite the fact that mutant and native shared a similar overall structure . In the structure of CD EFhd2 S183E , the C - terminal linker region that con - tains the S183E mutation displayed a high ﬂ exibility in crystallo - graphic B - factor analysis , both before and after ensemble re ﬁ nement ( Figs . 1 and 2 ) . This can be explained by the loss of the hydrogen bond between Asp181 and Ser183 that exists in the native structure . We also observed a higher thermostability of CD EFhd2 S183E compared to that of the native form , which we attributed to the increased charge repulsion between the actin - binding sites of the core domains ( Fig . 3 ) . Thus , we propose that Ser183 phosphorylation results in increased dynamicity of the C - terminal linker region in the monomeric structure and increases electrostatic repulsion between the actin - binding sites of the core domains in the dimer . Thereby , re - coordination of actin - binding sites within the dimer upon Ser183 phosphorylation reduces the F - actin - bundling capacity without changing the actin - binding activity . Among the numerous actin - binding proteins , dematin and fas - cin have beenwell studied with respect to the role of their structure in phosphorylation - dependent actin regulation [ 9 e 12 ] . It is inter - esting to note that these proteins also display limited changes in overall structure and reduced actin - binding and / or - bundling ac - tivity upon phosphorylation . Protein kinase C ( PKC ) - dependent phosphorylation at Ser39 of human fascin induced the reduction of F - actin - binding and - bundling activity [ 6 ] . A phospho - mimicking mutant ( S39D ) of fascin possessed lower F - actin - bundling activity and displayed local conformational changes such as secondary structure transitions ( Fig . S2A ) . Therefore , it has been suggested that the local structural changes around the actin - binding sites of fascin are critical for the regulation of F - actin - binding and - bundling activity [ 9 , 10 ] . Dematin consists of a large N - terminal core domain and a C - terminal headpiece domain . The headpiece domain itself is divided into an N - terminal and a C - terminal sub - domain , which are characterized by the presence of a V - loop and an actin - binding site , respectively . Cyclic AMP - dependent protein kinase - induced phosphorylation at Ser403 of the headpiece domain has been shown to abolish its F - actin - bundling activity [ 11 ] . Although the headpiece S403E phospho - mimicking mutant of dematin displayed no signi ﬁ cant changes in overall structure , local changes in the structure of the phosphorylation site were observed , in particular the formation of a salt bridge between Lys353 and Glu403 ( S403E ) . As Lys353 is located in the V - loop of the N - terminal subdomain , this results in a reduction in the mobility of this subdomain ( Fig . S2B ) . Therefore , it was suggested this phosphorylation - induced change in mobility may trigger a re - orientation of the actin - binding domain , which leads to the inhi - bition of F - actin - bundling capacity , regardless of F - actin - binding activity [ 11 , 12 ] . In the current study , we made a similar observation regarding phosphorylation at Ser183 of EFhd2 , as the phospho - mimicking S183E mutation did not affect the overall structure of the actin - Fig . 1 .

Instead , it increased the ﬂ exibility of the linker region between the actin - binding sites and the dimerization domain ( i . e . , the C - terminal coiled - coil domain ) , with the ﬂ exibility increase being accompanied by changes in surface charge distribution . These effects may trigger a re - coordination of the actin - binding sites in the homodimer structure , thereby mak - ing it unsuitable for F - actin - bundling without changing the F - actin - binding activity ( Fig . 4 ) . EFhd2 is a cytoskeleton - associated protein containing various phosphorylation sites ; it is involved in Ca 2 þ binding activity and B Cell Receptor ( BCR ) - induced apoptosis , while it has been linked to pathological conditions such as Alzheimer ' s disease [ 26 ] . Structural and biochemical studies on the full - length protein , thus including additional phosphorylation sites , is bound to provide further insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of EFhd2 function by phosphorylation .

Schematic model of the mechanism of regulation of the EFhd2 actin - bundling capacity by phosphorylation . Native EFhd2 ( left ) forms a rigid structure to bundle F - actin . In contrast , phosphorylated EFhd2 ( right ) displays a reduced actin - bundling activity due to re - coordination of two adjacent actin - binding sites in the dimer structure . K . R .
