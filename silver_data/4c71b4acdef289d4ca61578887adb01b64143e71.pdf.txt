The noncovalent assembly of the a , b , and g subunits define three classes of IL2 receptors . The three subunits abg are expressed on activated lymphocytes and define high - affinity IL2 receptors . The a chain , which is not functional by itself , binds IL2 with low affinity and is found on activated T lymphocytes together with high - affinity receptors . The IL2 receptor b chain is also a subunit of the IL15 receptor , and the g subunit is shared by other interleukin receptors , namely IL4 , IL7 , IL9 , and IL15 receptors . IL2 receptor subunits arealso expressed in nonlymphoid cell types , including human fibroblasts , endothelial , epithelial , and neuronal cells ( Thorpe , 1998 ) . Only the b and g subunits are able to transduce the IL2 signal , but none of the chains has tyrosine kinase activity . In contrast to numerous studies on IL2 - medi - ated signal transduction , little is known of the sorting of IL2 receptors at the cell surface of activated lympho - cytes . Yet one of the earliest events that follows the binding of IL2 to its receptors is the efficient internaliza - tion of IL2 receptor complexes , which eventually leads to the degradation of IL2 in lysosomes ( Duprez et al . , 1988 ) . Therefore , receptor - mediated endocytosis of IL2 receptorsrepresentsacriticalearlystepinthemolecularcontrolofIL2receptorfunction . Results Figure 1 . Endocytosis of IL2 Receptors Is Not Inhibited by Overex - pression of Eps15 Dominant - Negative Mutants The Uptake of IL2 Receptors Occurs Normally in Cells L abg cells were transfected by cDNAs coding for GFP - DIII ( [ A ] and Defective in Clathrin - Dependent Endocytosis [ B ] ) or GFP - E D 95 / 295 ( [ C ] and [ D ] ) and incubated for 15 min at 37 8 C We had shown previously that endocytosis of IL2 recep - with Cy5 - Tf and mAb 341 .

To unambigu - ized Cy5 - Tf or internalized Cy3 - bound b subunit ( n 5 5 ) . ouslyestablishandcharacterizethisnovelclathrin - inde - pendent pathway , we now sought to inhibit the clathrin - dependent endocytic machinery using more specific endocytosis of the IL2 receptor ( Figure 1D ) . Statistical analysis showed that more than 90 % of cells positive and defined tools . We took advantage of the recently characterized Eps15 , a protein that is specifically re - for GFP - DIII ( Figure 1E , solid bars ) or GFP - E D 95 / 295 ( hatched bars ) were defective in clathrin - mediated en - quired for clathrin - dependent endocytosis .

Yet numerous endocytic cytes ( Han et al . , 1995 ) , it was important to show that the clathrin - independent pathway identified in L abg structures loaded with the b subunit of the IL2 receptor were present at the same time in transfected cells and cells was also present in lymphoid cells . Therefore , we visualized , at the ultrastructural level , the simultaneous were identical to the staining observed in nontrans - fected cells ( Figure 1B ) . We then overexpressed an EH - distribution of receptors and clathrin - coated structures on the inner side of the plasma membrane of YT lympho - deleted Eps15 mutant ( E D 95 / 295 ) that inhibits clathrin - coated pits assembly in a manner different from the DIII cytes , a human natural killer cell line induced to express high - affinity trimeric IL2 receptors . We used the so - domain ( Benmerah et al . , 1999 ) . Again , overexpression of the E D 95 / 295 mutant prevented receptor - mediated called “ripped - off” technique developed by Anderson and collaborators in adherent cells ( Sanan and Ander - endocytosis of Tf ( Figure 1C , arrow ) without affecting Endocytosis of IL2 Receptors 663 Figure 2 . Ultrastructural Analysis of IL2 and Tf Receptor Distribution at the Plasma Membrane of Lymphocytes YT cells were incubated for 1 hr at 4 8 C with anti - b subunit 561 mAb ( [ A ] and [ B ] ) or anti - Tf receptor D65 mAb ( [ C ] – [ E ] ) , followed by incubation with gold particles conjugated to protein A . They were then warmed for 3 min at 37 8 C to initiate the recruitment of receptors into endocytic structures . Plasma membranes were then ripped off and processed for electron microscopy . Both flat clathrin lattices ( arrowheads ) and coated pits ( arrows ) were labeled with Tf receptors ( [ C ] – [ E ] ) . In contrast , no IL2 receptors were found in these structures ( [ A ] and [ B ] ) . Scale bar , 100 nm . In ( F ) , the area of randomly selected negatives of electron micrographs was measured at a magnification of 3 3000 . Gold particles were counted under the microscope with respect to their localization in flat clathrin lattices , clathrin - coated pits , or other areas . Control experiments were performed with BSA - gold . son , 1991 ) , since it allows isolation of large areas of ( Damke et al . , 1994 ) . We next visualized the specific distribution of Tf receptors and IL2 receptors at the plasma membrane , a prerequisite for relevant statistical analysis in lymphocytes that express low numbers of IL2 plasmamembranebyimmunogoldstainingoftherecep - tors . As expected , the vast majority of Tf receptors ( 66 % receptors . We could easily identify numerous clathrin - coated structures in YT lymphocytes , including flat of total gold particles ) were recruited and concentrated into clathrin lattices and clathrin - coated pits ( Figures polygonal lattices of clathrin ( Figure 2 , arrowheads ) and deeply invaginated coated pits with high electron den - 2C – 2E ) . This is in contrast to IL2 receptors ( Figures 2A and 2B ) , which could not be found in clathrin - coated sity around their necks ( arrows ) that were identical to the clathrin - coated structures described in HeLa cells structures but were rather confined as aggregates to Molecular Cell 664 distinct domains of the plasma membrane ( 98 % of total goldparticles ) . Interestingly , IL2receptorswereconcen - trated on some protein patches and clustered according to a pattern different from the clustering of Tf receptors , suggesting some mechanistic differences in the recruit - ment of the receptors . Importantly , gold particles were bound to Tf and IL2 receptors using the same protocol and similar combinations of primary and secondary anti - bodies , which rules out a nonspecific effect of antibody clustering for the observed differences between Tf and IL2 receptors . The quantitative ultrastructural analysis of the local - ization of IL2 receptors at the cell surface of lympho - cytes confirms that IL2 receptors are not sorted through clathrin - coated pits and accounts for the lack of inhibi - tionofIL2endocytosis byEps15dominant - negativemu - tants . Importantly , these results demonstrate that the clathrin - independent pathway followed by IL2 receptors exists constitutively in lymphocytes independently from any treatment .

All these properties were in agreement with previouscharacterizations ( BrownandRose , 1992 ; Field investigatedwhetherIL2receptorswereassociatedwithdetergent - resistant membrane domains .

To assess the lysedat4 8 Cinabuffercontaining0 . 5 % TritonX - 100 , and DRM fractions were recovered as floating low - density relative abundance of both proteins in each fraction , an equal amount of total proteins from each fraction was fractions ( fractions 4 – 6 ) separated from the bulk of solu - bilized membrane proteins located at the bottom of the run on SDS – PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting . Under these conditions , IL2 receptors were found in the gradient ( fractions 9 and 10 , here referred to as HD for heavy density fractions ) . We first validated this fraction - glycolipid / cholesterol - enriched fractions of YT lympho - cytes , as shown by the tight codistribution of the IL2 ation scheme by checking the biochemical criteria that define DRMs . DRMs fractionated from lymphocytes receptor b subunit with that of GM1 in Figure 3A .

Overexpres - pendent endocytosis can account for as much as 50 % sion of wild - type RhoA did not affect the uptake of both of the overall endocytic activity ( for review see Sandvig Tf and IL2 receptors ( Figures 6B and 6C ) .

Recent evidence has given lipids a more active GDP - bound state , a molecular switch that controls their role in protein sorting and membrane trafficking ( re - activity . This cycle is regulated by the cytosolic guanine viewed in Mukherjee and Maxfield , 2000 ) . Although the nucleotide dissociation inhibitors , RhoGDIs , which lock structure and the role of rafts awaits further character - the Rho family GTPases in the GDP - bound inactive state ization , they have been involved in various cellular and remove them from the membrane - associated pool . events such as signaling , cell polarity , or protein sorting We therefore examined the role of RhoGDI in the uptake ( reviewed in Brown and London , 2000 ) . The fact that of Tf and IL2 receptors . Again , we found a differential DRMscan beisolated fromTcell linesthat lackcaveolae effect of RhoGDI , as the uptake of IL2 receptors was led to the hypothesis that these domains would replace totally prevented , whereas Tf endocytosis proceeded caveolae in these cells ( reviewed in Kurzchalia and Par - normally in L abg cells transfected by an His 6 - tagged ton , 1999 ) . Our results strongly suggest that clathrin - form of RhoGDI ( Figure 6I versus 6H ) . The data pre - independentendocytosis ofIL2iscoupled totheassoci - sented in Figure 6N confirmed the results observed by ation of its receptors with DRMs .

Molecular Cell 668 Figure 6 . Rho Family GTPases Differentially Regulate IL2 and Tf Receptor Endocytosis The effects in L abg cells of GFP - RhoA wild - type ( [ A ] – [ C ] ) and GFP - RhoA Q63L ( [ D ] – [ F ] ) on the endocytosis of both IL2 ( [ C ] and [ F ] ) and Tf receptors ( [ B ] and [ E ] ) were analyzed usingtheprotocoldescribedinFigure1 . Cells transfected with His 6 - Rho GDI ( [ G ] – [ I ] ) were incubated with Cy5 - labeled Tf and mAb 341 . The cells were first incubated with His probe , an anti - His 6 tag polyclonal , and then incu - batedwithFITCanti - rabbitandgoatCy3anti - mouse IgG antibodies to detect RhoGDI ( [ G ] ) and endocytosed mAb 341 / b subunit com - plexes ( [ I ] ) , respectively . Cy5 - Tf staining is shown in ( H ) . In ( J ) – ( M ) , HA - RhoA T19N was detected with 12CA5 / Texas red - IgG mAbs .

Scale bar , 10 m m . In ( N ) , IL2 receptor endocytosis was analyzed by cytofluorimetry in HeLa cells transiently transfected with the b subunit of the IL2 receptor ( closed circle ) , with plasmids for the b subunit and GFP - RhoA Q63L ( open circles ) , b and GFP - Rho T19N ( squares ) , or b and His 6 - RhoGDI ( trian - gles ) . Cells labeled with mAb 341 at 4 8 C for 1 hr were washed and incubated for the indi - cated times at 37 8 C . Internalization of IL2 re - ceptors was monitored by the decrease in mean fluorescence , as a function of time at 37 8 C , of phycoerythrin - labeled mAb 341 / b subunitcomplexesatthecellsurfaceofGFP - or His 6 - positive cells ( n 5 3 ) . receptor b subunit in early endosomes ( He´mar et al . , support the initial observation that nonclathrin - coated invaginations accumulate at the synaptic membrane of 1995 ) , suggests that lipid domains are involved along the IL2 endocytic pathway . This hypothesis has been nerve terminals in the dynamin mutant flies shibire ts1 at the restrictive temperature ( Kosaka and Ikeda , 1983 ) . It recently supported by studies showing the presence of lipid rafts in vesicles and some endosomes in fibroblasts has been shown that purified dynamin can vesiculate synthetic liposomes ( Sweitzer and Hinshaw , 1998 ; Takei and MDCK cells , respectively ( Gagescu et al . , 2000 ; Ro - zelle et al . , 2000 ) . Our results , together with these stud - et al . , 1998 ) . Thus , dynamin could exert such a role on the lipids organizing caveolae and DRMs in living cells . ies , show that DRMs are well suited to mediate clathrin - independent endocytosis of IL2 receptors . There is growing evidence that Rho family members are important regulators of endocytic traffic . Interestingly , Initially , the dynaminGTPase was thought tobe exclu - sively involved in severing of clathrin - coated pits during activated RhoA and Rac1 , but not RhoGDI or inactivated RhoA , localize into caveolae ( Gingras et al . , 1998 ; Mi - receptor - mediated endocytosis . However , new evidence has shown that dynamin participates in other endocytic chaely et al . , 1999 ) . Likewise , the endocytosis of DRM - associated IL2 receptors could be regulated through the pathways , including the internalization of caveolae in mammalian cells ( Henley et al . , 1998 ; Oh et al . , 1998 ) . nucleotide - dependent localization of the Rho GTPases into plasma membrane DRMs .
