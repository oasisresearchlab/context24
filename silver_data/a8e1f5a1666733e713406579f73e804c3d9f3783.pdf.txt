However , the plasma membrane of the cells poses an impermeable barrier that prevents the large and highly negatively charged molecules to pass into cells . Since the vast majority of NA and ON targets locate inside the cells , their access to the cell interior is inevitable perquisite for exhibiting their functionality . To overcome the issue , various viral - and non - viral delivery vector systems have been designed and introduced . One class of such promising non - viral vectors is cell penetrating peptides ( CPP ) , which according to the name are able to efficiently cross the barrier of the plasma membrane . Most importantly , CPPs have the ability to transduce other molecules into cells , when coupled with either covalently or non - covalently . Currently , CPPs have been harnessed in highly diverse applications , how - ever , their wider utilization in vivo and for biomedical purposes has been limited due to the incomplete knowledge of their functioning . Quite recently it was believed that due to the positive charge , CPPs form with negatively charged ONs complexes carrying positive charge that associate with cell surface and deliver the payload into the cells by taking advantage of the distinct endocytic pathways . Contrary to expectation , it was recently discovered that the PepFect family peptide PepFect14 ( PF14 ) forms negatively charged complexes with splice - switching oligonucleotides ( SSO ) . Such negatively charged complexes should instead of association repel from the plasma membrane , however , these complexes are highly active in correcting the splicing within cells . This surprising finding suggests that the uptake of such complexes might be receptor mediated , even though it has been speculated that CPPs function independently of receptors . The main objective of the current thesis was to unravel the cellular uptake mechanism of PF14 complexes with splice - correcting oligonucleotide ( SCO ) , and in more detail we focused on the role and regulation of class A scavenger receptors ( cA - SRs ) . We demonstrate the contribution of two members of cA - SRs - SR - A3 and SR - A5 in the cellular uptake of the nanocomplexes . More pre - cisely , we show that the respective receptors are not present on the plasma membrane of HeLa pLuc705 cells constantly , but are recruited there in response to the exposure of cells to the nanocomplexes with the help of calcium and phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) dependent process . In addition , we also aim to determine the uptake mechanisms that nanocomplexes use for entering the cells , and analyze their subsequent intracellular fate . We demonstrate that binding of nanocomplexes to respective receptors induces the uptake by cells mainly via macropinocytosis and caveolae - dependent endocytosis , and after internalization the nanocomplexes are trafficked into rather non - acidic vesicles where nanocompelexes can induce their escape to the cytosol . 11 1 . LITERATURE OVERVIEW 1 . 1 Nucleic acid based gene therapy approaches Majority of NA - and ON - based therapies act through antisense mechanism to block the gene expression or to restore its normal function . Antisense approaches can be divided into RNA interference , antisense therapy and splice - switching approach . RNA interference ( RNAi ) was discovered in 1998 in the nematode C . elegans ( Fire and others 1998 ) , and to date , it has turned to the most powerful post - transcriptional gene regulation mechanism . RNAi response is initiated in response to long double - stranded RNA ( dsRNA ) that is cut into small ( 21 â 25 nucleotides ) interfering RNA ( siRNA ) sequences by cytosolic RNase III - like enzyme Dicer ( Bernstein and others 2001 ; Kole and others 2012 ) , and subsequently , siRNA is incorporated into RNA induced silencing complex ( RISC ) ( Sontheimer 2005 ) . Within the RISC complex , siRNA strands are separated , the antisense strand remains associated with RISC , and the sense strand is cleaved and released . Within the RISC complex , the antisense strand recognizes and binds in a sequence - specific manner to the target messenger RNA ( mRNA ) , and the endonuclease Argonaut 2 guides the degradation of target mRNA ( Kole and others 2012 ) . Antisense therapy is based on short ( 15 â 20 nucleotides ) single stranded antisense oligonucleotides that bind to target mRNA via Watson - Crick hybridi - zation and modulate the target mRNA translation in sequence specific manner . Antisense effect can be achieved either by inducing enzymatic cleavage of the target mRNA by RNase H , or by inhibition of translation by steric blockage of the ribosome ( Kurreck 2004 ; Kole and others 2012 ) . Splice - switching approach is a method to correct mutations caused by aberrant splicing , or to redirect splicing ( Bauman and others 2009 ) . Majority of human genes undergo alternative splicing , a post - transcriptional regulation mechanism by which different forms of mRNAs are produced from one gene , and results in production of structurally and functionally different protein variants ( Siva and others 2014 ) . However , alterations in splicing may lead to various genetic disorders , like Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( DMD ) or cystic fibrosis . DMD is a severe genetic neuromuscular disorder caused by mutations in dystrophin gene open - reading frame , and by loss of functional dystrophin protein ( Wood 2010 ) . Targeting of splice - switching oligonucleotides ( SCO ) complementary to the mutation site , gives an opportunity to correct the reading - frame and production of semi - functional dystrophin via exon - skipping mechanism ( Lu and others 2003 ) . mRNA - based therapeutics comprise a new class of drugs to introduce genetic material into cells ( Sahin and others 2014 ) . Once the mRNA is reached to the cell cytoplasm , it will be immediately translated by cellular translation machinery into functional protein . Basically , there are two options to introduce the mRNA into cells - the first approach is to deliver the mRNA into patients through ex vivo transfection , or secondly via direct delivery using various trans - fection methods ( Sahin and others 2014 ) . 12 1 . 2 Delivery methods for therapeutic molecules Delivery of ONs into target cells or tissues is extremely challenging . The large size and hydrophilic nature impedes ONs to transverse across the protective cell plasma membrane . Therefore an efficient and safe delivery vectors are required . A suitable delivery vector must overcome several of extra - and intracellular barriers , enable to condense ONs into stable complex to avoid the degradation , provide the access to the target cell / tissue , facilitate an efficient endosomal release , and allow cargo dissociation from the vector to ensure the delivery of the gene of interest to its target site in the cytoplasm or nucleus . Delivery vectors can be divided into two major classes : viral vectors and non - viral synthetic vectors . Viral vectors have been exploited in numerous gene delivery applications due to their natural property to invade host cells and carry their genetic material from cell to cell . In drug delivery purposes , the viral genome is replaced with therapeutic gene / drug in order to avoid viral replication and pathogenicity . To date , the vast majority of ongoing clinical trials are based on viral vectors ( Ginn and others 2013 ) . Although , viral vectors have high transfection efficiency , still their wider usage is impeded mainly because of safety concerns associated with their immunogenicity , and insertional muta - genesis and tumorigenesis ( Donsante and others 2001 ; Thomas and others 2003 ; Russell 2007 ) . The aforementioned issues related to viral vectors have prompted to seek for less toxic non - viral vectors . Non - viral gene delivery vectors are mainly based on synthetic cationic lipids and polymers , or peptides . Due to the cationic charge , lipids and polymers bind ONs via electrostatic interactions , and con - dense them into nanosized particles , lipoplexes and polyplexes , respectively . Cationic lipids have been extensively exploited in plenty of applications since their first utilization as gene delivery vector for plasmid DNA ( pDNA ) in 1987 ( Felgner and others 1987 ) . To date , hundreds of lipids have been devel - oped , all of which have common structural features : a positively charged head group , one or two hydrophobic tails , and a linker between the polar and hydro - phobic regions ( Lv and others 2006 ; Mintzer and Simanek 2009 ) . In addition to cationic lipids , some helper lipids , like cholesterol or 1 , 2 - dioleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphoethanolamine ( DOPE ) , are incorporated into lipoplex formulation to improve their transfection efficiencies and promote endosomal escape ( Zuhorn and others 2005 ) . Among the cationic polymers , polyethylenimine ( PEI ) is one of the most widely used polymers ( Boussif and others 1995 ; Pack and others 2005 ; Mintzer and Simanek 2009 ) . PEI is synthetic polymer with high cationic charge density and protonable amino groups ( Werth and others 2006 ) . Due to the polymeric nature , PEI as well as other polymers , can be synthesized with different lengths , geometries and molecular weights , e . g . with branched or lin - ear structure ( Godbey and others 1999 ; Elouahabi and Ruysschaert 2005 ) . Other widely used polymers are polyornithines ( PLO ) , polyamidoamidine dendrimers and chitosan ( Pack and others 2005 ; Mintzer and Simanek 2009 ) . 13 Cationic polyplexes and lipoplexes are mainly taken up via endocytic path - ways initiated by electrostatic interactions between the positively charged poly - plexes / lipoplexes and negatively charged cell surface components ( Mislick and Baldeschwieler 1996 ; Mounkes and others 1998 ; Wiethoff and others 2001 ) . However , the induction of endosomal escape and release of cargo from endo - somes is fundamentally different ( Elouahabi and Ruysschaert 2005 ) . Endosomal release of lipoplexes is mainly driven by hydrophobic interactions assisted by fusogenic helper lipids , e . g . DOPE ( Zuhorn and others 2005 ) . Endosomal escape of cationic polymers , e . g . PEI and dendrimers , is believed to rely on their intrinsic endosomolytic activity ( Patil and others 2009 ) . Due to the high amount of tertiary amine groups , cationic polymers can act as âproton spongesâ to raise the endosomal pH by promoting influx of ions and water , rupture of endosomal membrane and release of sequestered material into the cytosol . However , recent experimental data suggests that the âproton spongeâ effect is not the dominant mechanism of how PEI induces the endosomal leakage ( Benjaminsen and others 2013 ) . Still , the polyplexes and lipoplexes suffer from relatively poor transfection efficiency , especially in vivo , caused by their highly charged nature and due to the adsorption of serum proteins ( Li and Szoka 2007 ; Gao and others 2007 ) . On the other hand , polyplexes and lipoplexes are easily modified in order to improve their targeting capabilities or endosomal escape . For example , addition of targeting ligand , e . g . ligands of nutrient receptors for folate or transferrin , improves their uptake into cancer cells that often express high amount of folate or transferrin receptors ( Biswal and others 2010 ; Kircheis and others 2001 ) . In order to improve the endosomal escape , incorporation of fusogenic peptides such as KALA or GALA into lipoplex / polyplex have been described ( Kakudo and others 2004 ) . To overcome their poor serum stability , covering the surface of the nanoparticles with polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) reduce interactions with serum components and prolong the circulation time ( Petersen and others 2002 ; Huang and others 2010a ) . 1 . 3 Cell penetrating peptides Cell penetrating peptides ( CPP ) compromise another class of non - viral delivery vectors with membrane penetrating properties . The research field of CPPs was established nearly 30 years ago when two independent groups discovered the membrane translocation property of human deficiency virus 1 ( HIV - 1 ) trans - activator protein TAT ( Frankel and Pabo 1988 ; Green and Loewenstein 1988 ) . A couple of years later , in 1991 , a 60 amino acid region of the Drosophila antennapedia homeobox protein was demonstrated to be capable of penetrating nervous cells ( Joliot and others 1991 ) , and few years later , the same group identified that only a 16 amino acid long sequence from the third helix of the full - length protein is sufficient for membrane penetration , and was named as penetratin ( Derossi and others 1994 ) . Subsequently , the minimal sequence 14 responsible for the uptake of TAT - protein was determined and named as Tat peptide ( Vives and others 1997 ) . Soon after the discovery of ânaturalâ CPPs , the synthetic model amphipathic peptide MAP ( Oehlke and others 1998 ) , the first chimerical CPP transportan ( TP ) ( Pooga and others 1998 ) , and fully synthetic sequences composed of arginines ( Mitchell and others 2000 ) with cell penetrating ability were designed . Ever since , the family of CPPs has been increasingly expanded and up to date hundreds of CPPs with different chemis - tries and properties have been discovered or designed . Due to their great sequence variety and different physio - chemical properties , it is difficult to define the uniform concept for all CPPs , however they still share some common features : they are relatively short sequences , usually 5 â 40 amino acids long , with the capacity to promote the intracellular delivery of bioactive cargos by means of different mechanism , mainly via endocytosis ( Langel 2015 ) . 1 . 3 . 1 Classification of CPPs CPPs can be divided by their physical - chemical properties into three classes : amphipathic , hydrophobic and cationic ( Milletti 2012 ; Pooga and Langel 2015 ) . Amphipathicity corresponds to the partitioning of hydrophilic and hydro - phobic parts into opposite side of the molecule ( Hristova and others 1999 ) , and such property on the one hand favors the interactions with negatively charged membrane components via electrostatic interactions , and the hydrophobic domain on the other hand is responsible for insertion into lipid membrane . Amphipathic CPPs , in turn are split into two , the primary and secondary amphi - pathic CPPs . Primary amphipathic CPPs comprises hydrophobic and hydro - philic domains in their primary structure , often after folding to Î± - helices ( Song and others 2011 ) . Experiments with model membranes have revealed that the primary amphipathic CPPs bind equally efficiently to both anionic and neutral lipids , suggesting that hydrophobic interactions with membranes dominate over the electrostatic interactions ( Magzoub and others 2001 ) . CPPs belonging to this class are usually composed of more than 20 amino acids , however , only a few of them are reported to be basic . The long enough sequence is thought to allow the peptides to submerge into lipid bilayer , and therefore potentially destabilize the membranes ( Ziegler 2008 ) . A prototypical primary amphipathic CPP is chi - meric TP consisting of 27 amino acids , of which the first 12 amino acids are derived from neuropeptide galanin , and linked via lysine residues to 14 amino acid long mastoparan peptide from wasp venom ( Pooga and others 1998 ) . Stud - ies on model membrane systems have demonstrated that the amphipathic Î± - helix of the peptide is provided by C - terminal mastoparan ( Barany - Wallje and others 2004 ) . In order to diminish the inhibitory effect of TP to GTPase activity , a shorter TP analogue TP10 was introduced ( Soomets and others 2000 ) . TP10 lacks 6 amino acids in the N - terminal part of TP , however , deletion of these amino acids did not affect the uptake of the peptide ( Soomets and others 2000 ) . Introduction of further chemical modifications to the TP10 backbone lead to the 15 development of PepFect ( PF ) and NickFect ( NF ) family CPPs ( El Andaloussi and others 2011 ; Ezzat and others 2011 ; Oskolkov and others 2011 ) . Other well - known primary amphipathic CPPs are MPG ( Morris and others 1997 ) and Pep - 1 ( Morris and others 2001 ) ( Table 1 ) . In secondary amphipathic CPPs , the hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains are not segregated in their primary structure , however , after binding to membranes , peptides undergo a conformational change to adopt either Î± - helical ( Lamaziere and others 2007 ; Crombez and others 2009 ) or Î² - strand ( Magzoub and others 2001 ) structure , which allows positioning of hydrophobic amino acids on the one side and cationic parts on the opposite side . Secondary amphipathic CPPs are generally shorter than primary amphipathic CPPs , and unlike primary amphipathic CPPs , secondary amphipathic CPPs bind prefer - entially with membranes containing high amount of anionic lipids , however , affinity to neutral lipids has been reported to be rather low ( Ziegler 2008 ; Binder and Lindblom 2003 ) . Penetratin ( Derossi and others 1994 ) , CADY ( Crombez and others 2009 ) and MAP ( Oehlke and others 1998 ) are examples of secondary amphipathic CPPs ( Table 1 ) . Cationic CPPs , also referred as non - amphipathic CPPs , contain high number of positively charged amino acids , most often arginines or lysines . In analogy to secondary amphipathic CPPs , cationic CPPs associate only with membranes that contain high amount of anionic lipids ( Ziegler 2008 ) . However , due to the highly cationic nature , the association with membranes is predom - inantly forced by electrostatic interactions with negatively charged plasma membrane components . Nevertheless , not all cationic amino acids exhibit similar binding and internalization efficiency ; arginines are considered to be by far more effective at entering the cells than other basic amino acids , for example lysine , histidin or ornithine ( Mitchell and others 2000 ) . The phenomenon of arginine relies on the guanidinum headgroups that form stable hydrogen bonds after interactions with anionic membrane components ( Mitchell and others 2000 ) . Interestingly , the rate of cellular entry of cationic CPPs is also dependent on the number of arginine residues in the sequence . Peptide sequences with more than 6 arginine residues possessed significantly higher uptake rate than shorter ones , however , the optimal length for delivery purposes have been proposed to possess 8 â 9 arginine residues . The longer sequences lead to toxic side effects and lower uptake rates ( Mitchell and others 2000 ; Futaki and others 2001 ; Suzuki and others 2002 ) . In addition to polyarginines , also Tat peptide ( Vives and others 1997 ) and M918 ( El - Andaloussi and others 2007 ) belong to this group ( Table 1 ) . Hydrophobic CPPs comprise the smallest number of CPPs . They are predominantly composed of nonpolar amino acids with no or few basic amino acids ( Milletti 2012 ) . Hydrophobic CPPs are for example anionic and cationic pentapeptides ( Gomez and others 2010 ) , and stapled peptides ( Bernal and others 2007 ; Brown and others 2013 ; Milletti 2012 ) . 16 Table 1 .

The covalent linkage is based on chemical crosslinking , e . g . disulfide bridges , to couple CPPs with cargo molecules ( Pooga and others 1998 ; Turner and others 2005 ) . The disulfide bridge in general , is cleavable in the reducing environment of the cytosol , and thus allows the dissociation of the cargo from delivery vector . Chemical linkage results in conjugates with well - defined structural character - istics , however , this strategy is not beneficial for large and charged molecules like pDNA , SCO and siRNA . Covalent strategy has been mainly exploited for non - charged or neutral cargo molecules , like peptide nucleic acids ( PNA ) and phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligonucleotides ( PMO ) . As the covalent strat - egy relies on chemical linkage , it may have also an impact on cargo function - ality . 17 The non - covalent strategy was introduced by the group of Divita and Heitz in 1997 , and this approach relies on electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions associating highly positively charged CPPs and negatively charged nucleic acids ( Morris and others 1997 ) . Unlike covalent - linkage , non - covalent strategy is less laborious and time - consuming as complexes are formed by simple mixing . However , the formed nanoparticles might be heterogeneous in terms of size and shape , therefore their exact characterization is complicated . 1 . 4 CPP mediated oligonucleotide delivery CPPs have extensively been utilized for delivery of different of ONs , including PNAs , PMOs , siRNAs , SCOs , and pDNAs , both via covalent or non - covalent strategy in multiple of applications . The first successful CPP - based ON delivery study was introduced in 1997 by a group of G . Divita ( Morris and others 1997 ) . The authors demonstrated that the chimeric peptide MPG efficiently condensed short single - or double - stranded ONs into nanoparticles that entered the cells mainly via non - endocytic pathway ( Morris and others 1997 ) . Soon after this , the very first successful CPP - based in vivo experiment was conducted ( Pooga and others 1998 ) . In this study , PNA complementary to human galanin receptor 1 mRNA was covalently coupled with transportan and penetratin , and such conjugates were readily able to down - regulate galanin receptors in rat brain ( Pooga and others 1998 ) . Thereafter , numerous of CPP - based in vivo ON delivery approaches have been reported . The first in vivo experiment with non - covalent nanocomplexes was demonstrated in 2007 by using PNA analogue , negatively charged HypNA - pPNA targeting the cyclin B1 , and Pep - 3 peptide ( Morris and others 2007 ) . HypNA - pPNA - Pep3 showed high activity in cell culture , unfortunately , these nanocomplexes were found to be rather inefficient in in vivo models . After intravenous administration , only 20 % of reduction in tumor growth was observed , suggesting that the stability of the complexes in the presence of serum is severely affected . To solve this issue , nanoparticles were modified with PEG molecules , and such modification substantially improved the stability and delivery of complexes , yielding in 90 % of reduction of tumor growth ( Morris and others 2007 ) . Majority of the splice - switching applications in vitro are based on using HeLa pLuc705 reporter cells introduced by Prof . R . Kole ( Kang and others 1998 ) . These cells carry a luciferase gene interrupted by mutated ï¢ - globin intron 2 that leads to production of nonfunctional protein . However , admin - istration of SCOs complementary to this site , masks the mutation , redirects the splicing machinery and leads to production of a functional protein . One of the first most potent SCO delivery vector was ( RxR ) 4 , an oligoarginine analogue in which arginine residues are linked with 6 - aminohexanoic acid linker ( Abes and others 2006 ) . Covalent conjugates of ( RxR ) 4 and PMO or PNA against mutated site have been shown to induce efficient splice redirection and production of 18 functional protein in HeLa pLuc705 cells , as well as in the mdx DMD mice model ( Said Hassane and others 2010 ; Fletcher and others 2006 ; Ivanova and others 2008 ) ; however , such complexes were frequently found to be sequestered into endosomes . Further , modifying the ( RxR ) 4 with stearyl moiety substan - tially increased the splice - correction activity of SCOs compared to unmodified RxR4 in both , cell culture and in DMD models in vivo , probably due to the positive effect of fatty acid moiety on endosomal escape . Although , the efficiency of stearylated and un - modified ( RxR ) 4 to deliver PMO was quite comparable , still in case of stearylated - ( RxR ) 4 , 10 - times lower PMO concen - tration was required ( Lehto and others 2010 ) . Recently , new chemically modified stearyl - TP10 , and its analogues PepFects were designed for ON delivery ( El Andaloussi and others 2011 ; Hassane and others 2011 ; Ezzat and others 2011 ) . PepFect14 ( PF14 ) is stearylated TP10 analogue , in which iso - leucines are substituted with leucines , and ornithines are introduced instead of lysines as a source of positive charges ( Ezzat and others 2011 ) . The design of PF14 was based on earlier reports where poly - L - ornithines were found to possess superior transfection efficiency compared to poly - L - lysine based systems , mainly due to the higher affinity for DNA and formation of more stable complexes ( Ramsay and Gumbleton 2002 ) . Indeed , PF14 - SCO nano - particles exceeded the transfection efficiency of stearyl - TP10 in HeLa pLuc705 cells , and exhibited high splice - correction activity even in mdx mouse myo - tubes , a cell culture model of DMD ( Ezzat and others 2011 ) . Importantly , PF14 exceeded the delivery efficiency of commercially used transfection reagents Lipofectamine 2000 ( LF2000 ) , RNAiMAXâ¢ and jetPEIâ¢ ( Ezzat and others 2011 ) . During the recent years , a great progress has made in the field of SCO delivery in terms of DMD therapy . The PNA / PMO internalization peptide ( Pip ) , designed on basis of ( RxR ) 4 and R6 - Penetratin , has been confirmed to be the most intriguing delivery vector for ONs in numerous of therapeutic applications of DMD ( Yin and others 2011 ; Betts and others 2012 ) and spinal muscular atrophy ( SMA ) ( Hammond and others 2016 ) . The most prominent peptides of this group are Pip5 and Pip6 , and conjugated with PMO , are capable of restoring dystrophin expression at high level in nearly all muscle types , include - ing cardiac muscles ( Yin and others 2011 ; Betts and others 2012 and 2015 ) , as well as restoration of survival moto neuron protein in SMA disease models ( Hammond and others 2016 ) . The first successful CPP - mediated siRNA delivery was achieved with MPG peptide ( Simeoni and others 2003 ) . The noncovalent complexes of MPG and siRNA against luciferase yielded in about 80 % of reduction in luciferase production , in both HeLa and Cos - 7 cells . In 2007 , it was reported that the fusion peptide of R9 and rabies virus glycoprotein ( RVG ) is able to transport siRNA across the blood - brain - barrier ( Kumar and others 2007 ) . Upon intra - venous injection of RVG - R9 - siRNA complexes against GFP into mice , the complexes were readily detectable in the brain where a 50 % reduction in GFP expression was observed , concurrently no significant uptake was seen in the liver or spleen ( Kumar and others 2007 ) . Soon after this , a new potent siRNA 19 delivery vector , CADY was introduced ( Crombez and others 2009 ) . CADY is a secondary amphipathic CPP with C - terminal cysteamide modification to improve the interactions with membranes and to stabilize formed complexes ( Morris and others 2001 ; Simeoni and others 2003 ) . Indeed , CADY formed stable complexes with siRNA that in high efficiency mediated the down - regulation of glyceralderhyde - 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) in suspen - sion and primary cells . Importantly , the uptake of CADY - siRNA nanocom - plexes was independent of endocytosis ( Crombez and others 2009 ; RydstrÃ¶m and others 2011 ) ; however , very recent experimental data revealed that CADY - siRNA nanoparticles enter the cells mainly via receptor - mediated endocytosis ( Lindberg and others 2015 ) . At the same time , a group of S . Dowdy introduced an interesting strategy for siRNA delivery that relies on double - stranded RNA binding domain ( DRBD ) and Tat peptide ( Eguchi and others 2009 ) . Tat - DRBD - siRNA against GFP or GAPDH was shown to induce efficient gene knock - down in primary cell - lines without notable toxic side effects . Tat - DRBD also exhibited efficient RNAi response against luciferase upon intranasal adminis - tration in vivo ( Eguchi and others 2009 ) . To improve the endosomal escape of siRNA , a group of Prof . Ã . Langel developed another stearyl - TP10 based peptide , PF6 , which has an extra modification , an endosomolytic trifluoro - methylquinoline moiety ( El Andaloussi and others 2011 ) . PF6 - siRNA nano - complexes targeting the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 ( HPRT1 ) or GAPDH exceeded the transfection efficiency of stearyl - TP10 - siRNA and yielded in high RNAi response in even hard - to - transfect cells , including primary mouse embryonal fibroblasts , human umbilical vein endothelial cells , mouse embryonic stem cells and Jurkat cells . Moreover , systemic admin - istration of PF16 - siRNA nanocomplexes against HPRT1 in vivo , yielded in high RNAi responses in variety of organs , but more than 60 % of knock - down was achieved in liver , lung and kidney , notably , without any acute toxicity for mice . Additionally , PF6 - siRNA nanoparticles at the dose of 1mg / kg siRNA substan - tially silenced the luciferase expression in mice liver , and the effect lasted more than a week ( El Andaloussi and others 2011 ) . Recently , it was introduced that the SPACE peptide is able to penetrate across the defensive skin barrier ( Hsu and Mitragotri 2011 ) . The SPACE peptide was discovered through in vitro phage display assay , and it shows excellent penetration through upper stratum corneum as well as into deeper dermis . Covalently coupled SPACE - siRNA conjugates induced high RNAi response in cell culture and in in vivo mice models to silence GAPDH and IL - 2 ( Hsu and Mitragotri 2011 ) . 1 . 5 Uptake mechanisms of CPP - cargo complexes In general there exist two main mechanisms to cross the protective lipid bilayer of the plasma membrane : endocytosis , and direct penetration across the plasma membrane . However , to date there is no consensus at which extent either of these entry mechanisms contributes to the uptake of CPPs . Direct penetration 20 across the plasma membrane is considered to occur at relatively high peptide concentration ( Duchardt and others 2007 ; Kosuge and others 2008 ) , and in the presence of small hydrophobic cargos , such as fluorescent dyes ( e . g AlexaFluor488 ) ( TÃ¼nnemann and others 2006 ; Hirose and others 2012 ) . How - ever , when CPPs are coupled with high molecular weight cargos , including ONs , the switch from direct penetration to endocytosis occurs ( TÃ¼nnemann and others 2006 ) . Nevertheless , direct penetration cannot be exclusively eliminated , as it has been described to be a prevalent entry route for amphipathic CPPs such as MPG , CADY , and Pep - 1 even with large cargo molecules ( Deshayes and others 2006 ; Konate and others 2010 ; RydstrÃ¶m and others 2011 ) . Still , the majority of studies , mainly based on pharmacological inhibitors or RNAi , highlight the role of endocytosis as primary mechanism for the uptake of CPP - cargo complexes ( Richard and others 2003 and 2005 ; Khalil and others 2004 ; Eguchi and others 2009 ; SÃ¤Ã¤lik and others 2009 ; Al Soraj and others 2012 ) . Cell entry via endocytosis includes clathrin - mediated endocytosis , caveolin - depend - ent endocytosis , macropinocytosis , and clathrin - and caveolin independent pathways ( Figure 1 ) , and frequently , CPPs may utilize different mechanisms simultaneously ( Duchardt and others 2007 ; SÃ¤Ã¤lik and others 2009 ; Arukuusk and others 2013 ; Juks and others 2015 ) , making the understanding of action of CPPs more complicated . Whether it is endocytosis or direct penetration , the internalization of CPP - cargo complexes is initiated by binding to cells . Due to the cationic nature of CPPs , it is believed that association with cells is triggered by electrostatic inter - actions with negatively charged cell surface components , e . g . glygosamin - glycans or phospholipids ( Nakase and others 2007 ; Lundin and others 2008 ; Ziegler and Seelig 2011 ) . Contrarily , group of S . Dowdy demonstrated that the entry of Tat - Cre fusion protein via macropinocytosis is not triggered through interactions with cell surface heparan sulfates or sialic acids , since the internalization of the fusion - protein was not affected in cells lacking glycans . Instead , the binding and uptake was found to be dependent on cell surface proteins ( Gump and others 2010 ) . Analogously , Ezzat et al discovered that PF14 nanocomplexes with SCOs obtain negative surface charge in transfection medium ( Ezzat and others 2011 ) , and thus , binding of such complexes to cell proteoglycans on the cell surface is not favorable , and requires specific receptor . Recently , we demonstrated that such complexes are recognized by class A scavenger receptors ( cA - SR ) , which efficiently promote their entry into cells by means of different endocytic mechanisms ( Ezzat and others 2012 ; Juks and others 2015 ) . Now it is clear that cA - SR dependent endocytosis is more general mechanism among PF and NF family peptides in complex with ONs ( Arukuusk and others 2013 ; Veiman and others 2013 ; Lindberg and others 2013 and 2015 ) . However , harnessing of cA - SR for internalization into cells is not only restricted to this type of peptides , but also CADY - siRNA nanoparticles , earlier believed to enter cells independently of endocytosis , engage cA - SRs to gain access into cells ( Lindberg and others 2015 ) . As the majority of CPP - ON complexes acquire negative zeta - potential in transfection media ( van Asbeck 21 and others 2013 ) , therefore it is feasible to speculate that scavenger receptors with promiscuous binding of anionic molecules ( Pearson and others 1993 ) , might contribute to the uptake of other CPP - ON complexes as well . Moreover , the transfection of commercial transfection regentâs PEI and PLO relies on cA - SR dependent endocytosis ( Lindberg and others 2015 ) . Scavenger receptors will be discussed in more detail below . Figure 1 . Schematic representation of endosomal entry routes and intracellular trafficking pathways for CPP - cargo complexes . MVB - multivesicular body , ER - endoplasmic reticulum . 22 1 . 5 . 1 Clathrin - mediated endocytosis Clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) is by far the most extensively studied endocytic entry route that is constitutively active in all mammalian cells . Through the CME cells internalize nutrients , regulate the number of cell surface proteins , and participate in receptor endocytosis ( Schmid 1997 ; Kirchhausen 2000 ) . Moreover , CME also contribute to generation of transport vesicles derived from trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) ( Griffiths and others 1988 ) . Clathrin coated vesicles ( CCV ) are relatively small , 100 â 150 nm in diameter , and characterized by the presence of coat formed by three - legged protein ( triskelion ) clathrin ( Kirchhausen 2000 ) . However , clathrin itself is unable to directly bind the membrane , and requires a coordinated assembly of adaptor and accessory proteins ( Kaksonen and others 2005 ; McPherson 2010 ) . It has been speculated that at least more than fifty different proteins contribute to CME and formation of clathrin coated pit ( CCP ) . The assembly of CCP is thought to be initiated in phosphatidylinositol ( 4 , 5 ) bisphosphate ( PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) rich regions of the inner leaflet on the plasma membrane ( Antonescu and others 2010 ) , where PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is specifically required for docking the main CME regulatory protein adaptor protein 2 ( AP2 ) to the membrane ( Abe and others 2008 ) . Abe and colleagues demonstrated that after depletion of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 from the plasma membrane , AP2 showed diffusive distribution , and the internalization of transferrin receptor was reduced . However , in control cell , AP2 was found to be clustered to the distinct plasma membrane regions that also contained tranferrin receptors , suggesting that PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is the main regulator of AP2 ( Abe and others 2008 ) . AP2 can bind with both , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and specific motifs in the cytoplasmic domain of the receptors , and thus participate in cargo selection to the nascent site of the pit . Subsequently , clathrin is recruited to the membrane via AP2 , followed by its polymerization and conversion of the flat plasma membrane into highly curved CCP ( Ungewickell and Hinrichsen 2007 ) . The budding of CCP depends on small cytoplasmic GTPase dynamin that polymerizes around the nascent vesicle neck and assist the membrane scission and budding of the vesicle ( Stowell and others 1999 ) . Subsequently , upon release into cytosol and before fusion with endosomal compartments , clathrin coat is quickly dissociated by ATPase heat shock cognate 70 and its cofactor auxilin ( Kirchhausen 2000 ) . Transferrin is prototypical cargo that enters the cells via CME . Its binding to transferrin receptor induces rapid entry within few minutes ( Ciechanover and others 1983 ) , followed by targeting to classical endo - lysosomal pathway , along which vesicles undergo progressive maturation with gradual drop in pH of vesicles from early - to late endosomes , and finally , the pathway terminates in lysosomes where transferrin is degraded . Engagement of CME for internalization have been demonstrated for Tat - PNA complexes ( Richard and others 2005 ) , for conjugates of TP or TP10 with PNA ( Lundin and others 2008 ) , and for nanocomplexes of PF6 and SCO ( Hassane and others 2011 ) . 23 1 . 5 . 2 Caveolin - dependent endocytosis Caveolae are small , 50 â 100 nm in diameter , bulb - shaped invaginations of the plasma membrane , where major constituent is a cholesterol - binding protein caveolin ( Cav ) ( Pelkmans and others 2001 ; Cheng and Nichols 2016 ) . There are three mammalian caveolins , Cav - 1 , Cav - 2 and Cav - 3 . Cav - 1 and Cav - 2 are expressed in non - muscle cells ( Scherer and others 1997 ) , whereas expression of Cav - 3 is restricted to muscle cells ( Tang and others 1996 ) , however , only Cav - 1 and Cav - 3 share the capacity to induce caveolae ( Hayer and others 2010 ) . Each of the caveola is estimated to contain 140 â 150 copies of caveolin proteins ( Pelkmans and Zerial 2005 ) . The caveolae rise from distinct plasma membrane regions , called rafts , that are rich in cholesterol , sphingolipids and glyco - phosphatidylinositol ( GPI ) linked proteins ( Pelkmans and others 2001 ; Harris and others 2002 ) . In addition to caveolin , caveolae are also enriched in cavin family proteins ( Briand and others 2011 ) , recruited to stabilize caveolin oligomers ( Liu and Pilch 2008 ) , and to regulate the dynamics and budding of caveolae ( Hill and others 2008 ) . High cholesterol content during caveolae formation is essential , since its depletion has yielded in dissociation of cavin proteins from the membrane and subsequent flattening of the invaginations ( Hill and others 2008 ) . In analogy to CME , dynamin is recruited for fission of caveolae from the plasma membrane ( Henley and others 1998 ) . Caveolae are present in most of eukaryotic cells , but are considered to be essentially abundant in endothelial cell , adipocytes and muscle cells ( Chidlow and Sessa 2010 ) . Caveolae have been implicated in numerous cellular pro - cesses , including cholesterol - and lipid metabolism , calcium signaling , endo - cytosis and transcytosis ( Parton and del Pozo 2013 ; Cheng and Nichols 2016 ) . Since the raft domains contain enormous amount of signaling molecules ( Okamoto and others 1998 ; Shaul and Anderson 1998 ) , caveolae also contribute to numerous signal transduction pathways . Caveolae are also responsible for uptake of some pathogens and their associated molecules , such as cholera toxin ( CT ) and simian virus SV40 ( Pelkmans and others 2001 ) . Unlike CCPs that are rapidly internalized into cells , caveolae are considered to be long - lived structures , which can be associated with the plasma membrane for long time periods without being internalized ( Kirkham and others 2005 ; Tagawa and others 2005 ; Pelkmans and Zerial 2005 ; Hayer and others 2010 ) . However , upon stimulation , e . g . simian virus SV40 , caveolae are pinched - off from the membrane and enter the cells . The early reports have proposed that budding of caveolae leads to the formation of distinct vesicular structure , the caveosomes that lack classical endosomal markers and possess neutral pH ( Pelkmans and others 2001 ) . However , subsequent studies have disproved the existence of such vesicles , and claimed that caveolae still fuse with early endosomes , and follow the trafficking through the endo - lysosomal system ( Pelkmans and others 2004 ; Hayer and others 2010 ) . Still , several experiments have revealed that the uptake via caveolae is not degradative , mainly because of the slow trafficking / maturation of vesicles aroused from caveolae ( Harris and 24 others 2002 ; Fittipaldi and others 2003 ; Tagawa and others 2005 ; Kirkham and others 2005 ) . Entry through caveolae may also address the material directly to Golgi apparatus or ER ( Pelkmans and others 2001 ; Le and Nabi 2003 ) . Cholesterol depletion by methyl - Î² - cyclodextrin has revealed that caveolin - dependent endocytosis is the main entry pathway for Tat - protein construct ( Fittipaldi and others 2003 ) . Knock - down of caveolin - 1 with siRNA signific - antly reduced the uptake of TP - and TP10 - protein conjugates as well ( SÃ¤Ã¤lik and others 2009 ) . Also , the uptake of NFs and PFs complexed with ONs occurs partially via caveolae - dependent manner ( Arukuusk and others 2013 ; Veiman and others 2013 ; Juks and others 2015 ) . Recently , by using a nystatin , an inhibitor of caveolin - dependent endocytosis , or RNAi to deplete Cav - 1 , we demonstrated that the uptake of PF14 - SCO complexes was reduced to 30 and 40 % level , respectively ( Juks and others 2015 ) , suggesting that PF14 - SCO com - plexes are partially internalized via caveolin - dependent pathway . 1 . 5 . 3 Macropinocytosis Macropinocytosis is highly regulated form of endocytosis , that leads to internalization of extracellular fluids and membrane bound bulk cargo ( Lim and Gleeson 2011 ) . Macropinocytosis is initiated by extensive actin rearrangement that results in formation of membrane ruffles , which subsequently collapse back to the plasma membrane and fuse with it to form large macropinosomes ( Swanson and Watts 1995 ) . Unlike to caveolae and clathrin - coated vesicles , macropinosomes lack an apparent coat structure , and are considerably larger in their size ranging from 0 . 2 â 5 ÂµM ( Swanson and Watts 1995 ) . Macropinocytosis occur in many cell types , but is constitutively active only in dendritic cells to capture antigens ( West and others 2000 ) , however , in many other cell types it is considered to be a transient response to external stimulation , most commonly a growth - factor stimulated process ( Falcone and others 2006 ; Commisso and others 2013 ; Kamphorst and others 2015 ) . Binding of growth - factors to respect - ive receptor - tyrosine kinase , cause activation of multiple signaling events initiated by activation of small GTPases like Rac1 and Cdc42 . Rac1 and CdC42 contribute to excessive actin - cytoskeleton reorganization , formation of plasma membrane ruffles and eventually macropinosome formation ( West and others 2000 ; Garrett and others 2000 ) . Rac1 and CdC42 , in turn activate and recruit kinases such as p21 - activated kinase 1 ( Pak1 ) and phosphatidylinositol - 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) to the plasma membrane ruffling areas , that are involved in regulation of actin - cytoskeleton dynamics ( Dharmawardhane and others 2000 ) , and mac - ropinosome closure ( Araki and others 1996 ) , respectively . In addition , the reorganization of actin cytoskeleton and subsequent membrane ruffling is highly sensitive to cholesterol and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 depletion from the membrane ( Grimmer and others 2002 ; Kwik and others 2003 ) . Unlike CME and caveolae , fission of macropinosomes from the plasma membrane is independent of dynamin activity ; instead , it recruits C - terminal - binding protein - 1 / brefeldinA - 25 ADP ribosylated substrate that associates around the neck of forming mac - ropinosome ( Liberali and others 2008 ) . Once the macropinosomes are formed and entered the cells , they are believed to undergo classical endo - lysosomal pathway from early endosomes towards the lysosomes ( Racoosin and Swanson 1993 ) . However , in human epidermoid A431 cells , a somewhat different trafficking has been described ( Hewlett and others 1994 ) . In these cells , after epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) stimulation , macropinosomes remained as a distinct population of vesicles that failed to fuse with conventional endosomes , and did not mature into late endosomes / lysosomes ( Hewlett and others 1994 ) . Instead , macropinosomes were directed to recycling pathway . Macropinocytosis has been pointed out to be the major entry route for arginine - rich CPPs and their complexes with ONs ( Nakase and others 2004 ; Al Soraj and others 2012 ) . Nakase et al demonstrated that binding of TAT and R8 with plasma membrane heparan sulfates can induce Rac1 - dependent actin cyto - skeleton remodeling and induction of macropinocytosis ( Nakase and others 2004 ) . Macropinocytosis also contributes to the biological activity of PF14 - SCO and NF - pDNA nanocomplexes ( Juks and others 2015 ; Arukuusk and others 2013 ) . 1 . 5 . 4 Clathrin - and caveolin - independent uptake routes Inhibition of CME or caveolin - dependent endocytosis does not arrest the endo - cytosis from the plasma membrane , and along with the three major pathways described above , there are also alternative pathways that are distinct from clathrin - and caveolin coated vesicles , e . g . CLIC ( clathrin independent carrier ) / GEEC ( GPI - anchored protein - enriched early endocytic compartment ) , flotillin - and Arf6 - dependent entry routes ( Sandvig and others 2011 ; Mayor and others 2014 ) . Similarly to caveolae , all these alternative pathways are associated with lipid - raft domains and are sensitive to cholesterol depletion ( Lamaze and others 2001 ; Howes and others 2010 ) . These pathways are further divided by their recruitment of dynamin into dynamin - dependent or - independent routes ( Mayor and Pagano 2007 ) . For example , the entry of interleukin - 2 receptor ( IL - 2 ) and EGF at high concentration have been proposed to occur via dynamin - dependent but clathrin - independent way ( Lamaze and others 2001 ; Sigismund and others 2005 ) . Both , the IL - 2 and EGF accumulate in raft domains before being internalized via uncoated vesicles . The most studied dynamin - independent pathway is CLIC / GEEC pathway , which is involved in the uptake of GPI - anchored proteins , extracellular fluid , bacteria and toxins ( for example CT and SV40 ) ( Kirkham and others 2005 ; Howes and others 2010 ) . Internalization of GPI - anchored proteins induces formation of tubular invaginations , CLICs , from the plasma membrane that further mature into early endosomal compartments GEECs ( Sabharanjak and others 2002 ) . CLIC / GEEC pathway recruits small GTPases Cdc42 and GTPase 26 regulator associated with focal adhesion kinase 1 ( GRAF1 ) to regulate the actin polymerization , and to give rise to tube - shaped membrane invaginations , respectively ( Lundmark and others 2008 ) . Another pathway for GPI - anchored proteins is dependent on raft - associated proteins flotillins / reggie , but do not require dynamin ( Glebov and others 2006 ) . There are two types of flotillins , flotillin - 1 and flotillin - 2 , and their co - assembly on the plasma membrane lipid - raft domain induces plasma membrane invaginations in similar shape and size range as caveolae , but lack the caveolin proteins ( Glebov and others 2006 ; Frick and others 2007 ) . 1 . 5 . 5 Endosomal trafficking After being endocytosed , the internalized material is subsequently directed to endosomal network , a complex vesicular system which main function is to receive and sort the internalized material to the final destination . Basically , two main intracellular trafficking pathways exist ; a recycling pathway to direct internalized material back to the plasma membrane , and endo - lysosomal path - way for degradation . There are four major endocytic compartments : early endosomes ( EE ) , recycling endosomes , late endosomes ( LE ) and lysosomes ( Figure 1 ) , which undergo multiple of fission and fusion steps in order to sort cargo to appropriate destination . The key regulators in endosomal membrane trafficking are the small GTP - binding Rab family proteins that can exist in active GTP - bound state or inactive GDP - bound state ( Zerial and McBride 2001 ; Lee and others 2009 ) . At active state , Rab - proteins are localized to vesicle membrane , and in association with specific effector proteins guide endosomal maturation . For example , Rab5 is present on EEs ( Gorvel and others 1991 ) , Rab4 and Rab11 are main markers of recycling endosomes ( Sonnichsen and others 2000 ) , and Rab7 and Rab9 for LEs ( Rink and others 2005 ) . No matter along which pathway the materials enter the cells ; they are firstly converged into early endosomes ( EEs ) that act as initial cargo - sorting stations . EEs are complex structures that consist of tubular domains and large intralu - minal vesicles ( ~ 400 nm in diameter ) ( Gruenberg 2001 ; Jovic and others 2010 ) , both of which give rise to vesicles with discrete function . The material , that is destined to recycle back to the plasma membrane , is sorted into tubular region of EEs , and is subsequently targeted to the cell surface directly or through recycling endosomes ( Figure 1 ) . On the other hand , the material that is destined for degradation accumulates in vesicle part of EEs ( Sonnichsen and others 2000 ) . Importantly , different regions of EEs are also characterized by different Rab regulatory proteins . Rab5 that is considered to be the key regulatory factor of EE fusion ( Gorvel and others 1991 ) , is mainly localized to vesicular part of EEs ; however the tubular part of EEs lack Rab5 , but it is rich in Rab4 ( Sonnichsen and others 2000 ) . In addition , the lumen of early endosomes is mildly acidic with pH ~ 6 , which is an appropriate environment for dissociation of many receptor - ligand complexes . 27 The cargo entrapped into intraluminal vesicles of EEs follows further traf - ficking towards lysosomes . During endosomal maturation from EEs to LEs , the composition of the endosomal membrane changes and Rab5 is substituted with Rab7 ( Rink and others 2005 ; Vonderheit and Helenius 2005 ) . In comparison with EEs , the environment of LEs is more acidic ( pH ~ 5 ) , and LEs are generally bigger with round or oval shape . LEs also contain numeral intraluminal ves - icles , and therefore are often called as multivesicular bodies ( MVB ) ( Miller and others 1986 ) ( Figure 1 ) . The pH of endosomes during their maturation is con - trolled by the concentration of endosomal membrane bound proton pump ATPases ( Forgac 2007 ) . Finally , the internalized material terminates in more acidic lysosomes ( pH 4 . 5 â 5 ) , where it is being degraded by lysosomal hydrolases . 1 . 5 . 6 Endosomal release of CPP - cargo complexes CPPs are promising tools to deliver ONs into cells , however , being mainly internalized via endocytosis , the main limiting obstacle in CPP - mediated ON delivery is their entrapment into endosomal vesicle ; however , to be functionally active , cargo needs to escape into cytosol or reach the nucleus . The exact mechanism , how CPP - cargo complexes promote the endosomal escape , and at which state and extent it occurs , remains to unknown yet , mainly because of lack of suitable methods to follow this explicitly . Recently , a couple of groundbreaking studies conducted by two separate groups provided new insights into endosomal release of siRNA - lipid nano - particles ( LNP ) ( Gilleron and others 2013 ; Wittrup and others 2015 ) . Using a combination of confocal laser scanning and electron microscopy , Gilleron et al revealed that the endosomal escape of LNPs occurs from maturing endosomes with characteristics of both early and late endosomes , and carrying respective markers . Moreover , only a very small fraction of siRNA was found to be released from endosomes , accounting only 1 â 2 % of the total amount of internalized siRNA ( Gilleron and others 2013 ) . Similar conclusions were also made by Wittrup and his colleagues ( Wittrup and others 2015 ) . Furthermore , the authors did not detect endosomal release from late endosomes or lysosome , showing that endosomal escape occurs during a very narrow time window . Moreover , only few siRNA molecules per single endosome reached the cytosol , suggesting that endosomal escape is not achieved through entire endosome burst , but rather as a consequence of slight permeabilization of the limiting membrane of endosome ( Wittrup and others 2015 ) . Whether the CPP - ON complexes also act in a similar way , needs further studies . To increase the rate of endosomal escape of CPP - cargo complexes , several approaches have been introduced . One possible strategy is to increase the hydrophobicity of CPPs by attachment of fatty acids to CPP sequence , and thereby promoting their interactions with membranes . Futaki and coworkers showed that attachment of N - terminal stearyl moiety to R8 increased its 28 efficiency to transfect plasmid DNA into cells by almost 2 orders of magnitude compared to unmodified R8 ( Futaki and others 2001 ) . Later , stearylated - R8 was also used to improve siRNA delivery ( TÃ¶nges and others 2006 ) . In addition , modifying the N - terminus of TP10 with stearyl moiety showed positive effect on SCO delivery and yielded in transfection efficiency comparable to the commercial reagent LF2000 without toxicity ( MÃ¤e and others 2009 ) . Likewise , addition of hydrophobic amino acid sequences composed of tryptophan or phenylalanine , have shown to increase the transfection efficiency and endo - somal release of CPP - cargo complexes ( Takayama and others 2009 ; Rydberg and others 2012 ; LÃ¶nn and others 2016 ) . For example , attachment of hydro - phobic penetration accelerating sequence ( PAS ) to R8 enhanced its intern - alization as well as widespread cytosolic distribution ( Takayama and others 2009 ) . The hydrophobic PAS sequence inserts into the lipid membrane of endo - somes , leads to membrane destabilization and thereby enhances the endosomal escape of sequestered material into the cytoplasm . Recently , LÃ¶nn et al intro - duced a tryptophane rich synthetic endosomal escape domain ( EED ) to improve the endosomal escape of Tat peptide ( LÃ¶nn and others 2016 ) . Conjugation of EED to GFP Î² 11 - TAT significantly improved the cytoplasmic delivery com - pared to the parent peptide without the modification . Another strategy to overcome endosomal entrapment is attachment of fusogenic peptides to CPP sequences . One of such peptides is derived from the influenza virus hemagglutinin protein HA2 that at low pH undergoes conform - ational change and adopts hydrophobic helical structure that inserts into lipid membrane , and promotes fusion of viral membrane with endosomal membrane ( Han and others 2001 ) . Attachment of fusogenic peptide HA2 to TAT peptide drastically improved its transduction properties ( Wadia and others 2004 ) . Increasing the endosomolytic properties of CPPs with incorporation of histidine residues in the CPP sequence is a third strategy to induce endosomal escape via âproton sponge effectâ . The imidazole group of histidine has a p K a of â¼ 6 . 0 , which allows absorbing protons in the acidic environment of the endosome , leads to osmotic swelling , membrane disruption and eventually endosomal escape ( Lo and Wang 2008 ) . Incorporation of histidine residues to arginine - rich CPPs such as Tat and R9 significantly improved their efficiency to deliver plasmid DNA into cells ( Lo and Wang 2008 ; Liu and others 2013 ) . Similarly , replacement of certain amino acids in penetratin sequence by histidine yielded in endosomolytic Î± - helical EB1 peptide that exhibited superior siRNA delivery efficiency over the parent peptide penetratin ( Lundberg and others 2007 ) . Alternative approach for provoking the endosomal escape is to apply endosomolytic agents , e . g chloroquine . Chloroquine is weak base that accu - mulates in acidic endosomes or lysosomes , and depending on its concentration , it can interfere with the acidification of endosomes by preventing accumulation of protons into endosomes ( at low concentrations ) , or induce influx of ions and water , and subsequent rapture of endosomes ( at high concentrations ) ( Ciftci and Levy 2001 ) . Wadia et al demonstrated that Tat - Cre fusion protein internaliza - tion into nucleus was significantly improved in the presence of chloroquine 29 ( Wadia and others 2004 ) . Analogously , stearyl - TP10 mediated SCO delivery and splice - correction activity was drastically enhanced when chloroquine was included into transfection medium ( MÃ¤e and others 2009 ) . Despite of its posi - tive effect on endosomal release , chloroquine is toxic to cells , and its applica - tion in gene therapy or clinical trials is questionable . Recently , a chloroquine analogue , trifluoromethylquinoline incorporation into steary - TP10 sequence resulted in a new peptide PF6 ( El Andaloussi and others 2011 ) . PF6 drastically improved the siRNA delivery and its functionality compared to its parent pep - tide stearyl - TP10 , moreover , PF6 did not exhibit any significant cytotoxic effects ( El Andaloussi and others 2011 ) . In addition , PF15 , an analogue of PF14 with trifluoromethylquinoline , exceeds the SCO induced splice - correction effi - ciency mediated by PF14 by almost two - fold ( Lindberg and others 2013 ) . 1 . 6 Scavenger receptors Scavenger receptors ( SR ) are transmembrane proteins that were discovered by Brown and Goldstein in 1979 , who originally defined SRs by their ability to bind and endocytose modified low density lipoproteins ( LDL ) ( e . g . acetylated and oxidized LDLs ) , but not native LDL molecules ( Goldstein and others 1979 ) . Therefore the early studies on SRs were mainly concentrated on their role in lipid metabolism and progression of atherosclerosis . However , since their first discovery nearly four decades ago , the family of SRs has expanded and now it is clear that SRs comprise a large supergroup of receptors with a range of physiological and pathological functions . The receptors of this family are divided into 10 classes , from A - J , based on their structural characteristics ( Figure 2 ) ( Prabhudas and others 2014 ; Zani and others 2015 ) . Interestingly , comprising structurally very diverse family with barely no or little structural homology between the classes , they all share similar function to bind poly - anionic ligands , including acetylated or oxidized LDLs , high density lipo - proteins , apolipoproteins , lipopolysaccharides , polyribonucleotides , apoptotic cells , double stranded ( ds ) RNA and - DNA , and synthetic nanoparticles ( Pearson and others 1993 ; Kanno and others 2007 ; Patel and others 2010 ; Lunov and others 2011 ; Yu and others 2012 ) . Exhibiting such an unusually broad ligand binding specificity , it is not surprising that SRs participate in multiple cellular processes , including endocytosis and phagocytosis ( Thomas and others 2000 ; Peiser and others 2002 ) cellular adhesion ( Cholewa and others 2010 ) , antigen presentation ( Abraham and others 1995 and 1997 ; Nicoletti and others 1999 ) . SRs also participate in activation of diverse cellular signaling events ( Jozefowski and Kobzik 2004 ; Baranova and others 2008 ; Huang and others 2010b ; Zani and others 2015 ) , as well as contribute to the progression of Alzheimer diseases ( El Khoury and others 1996 ; Husemann and others 2002 ) . SRs belong to the class of pattern recognition receptors ( PPR ) , and contribute to innate immune responses by recognizing intact bacteria and viruses , or pathogen - associated molecules ( Hampton and others 1991 ; Dunne and others 30 1994 ) , which is why they are so abundantly expressed in macrophages and other myeloid cells ( Hughes and others 1995 ) . However , SRs are not restricted to these types of cells , but are also found on numerous other cell types , including epithelial and endothelial cells , fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells ( PlÃ¼dde - mann and others 2007 ; Prabhudas and others 2014 ) . Recently it was speculated that due to their wide ligand binding repertoire , SRs do not function alone but rather belong to heteromultimeric signaling complexes together with Toll - like receptors ( TLR ) , integrins and tetraspanins ( Canton and others 2013 ) . In line of this , members of SRs have been shown to cooperate with TLR2 , TLR3 , TLR4 and TLR9 ( Peiser and others 2002 ; DeWitte - Orr and others 2010 ; Yu and others 2012 ) . Furthermore , TLRs and SRs often exhibit overlapping ligand - binding specificity . Figure 2 . Illustrative figure of scavenger receptors ( adopted from Zani and others 2015 ) . SRs constitute a large family of receptors , which according to the structural domains are divided into 10 classes , from A - J . The specific domains of class A recep - tors are indicated in the figure . 31 1 . 6 . 1 Class A scavenger receptors Class A scavenger receptors ( cA - SR or SCARA ) belong to a group of type two transmembrane glycoproteins with heterotrimeric structure ( Kodama and others 1990 ) . To date , five members of this class have been identified : SR - A1 , and its splice variants SR - A II and SR - A III ; MARCO ; SR - A3 ; SR - A4 and SR - A5 ( Figure 2 ) , where all monomers have a short cytoplasmic tail , single trans - membrane domain , spacer region , and long extracellular domain ( PlÃ¼ddemann and others 2007 ) . A unique structural feature among the members of cA - SR is the collagenous domain in extracellular domain of receptors ( Figure 2 ) . Addi - tionally , SR - A1 , MARCO and SR - A5 have a cysteine - rich domain in the extracellular part ( PlÃ¼ddemann and others 2007 ) . Nevertheless , being under investigation for years , only a few aspects about the multi - domain organization are known . By far , the best studied cA - SR receptors are SR - A1 and MARCO , and it has been proposed that positively charged regions in the extracellular domain are responsible for ligand binding . MARCO binds ligands mainly via the cysteine - rich domain ( Ojala and others 2007 ) ; however , recognition of acetylated and oxidized LDLs by SR - A1 is believed to be assisted rather by collagenous domain ( Doi and others 1993 ) . The cytoplasmic domain of cA - SR receptors regulates their membrane localization and internalization ( Kosswig and others 2003 ; Chen and others 2006 ) . SR - A1 and MARCO are generally expressed in macrophages and other myeloid cells ( Hughes and others 1995 ) with main function to endocytose modified LDLs , but also bacteria and other pathogen associated proteins , and thus provide innate defense against pathogens ( Elomaa and others 1995 ; Limmon and others 2008 ; Zhu and others 2011 ) . SR - A1 has also been implicated in lipid metabolism by its ability to bind apolipoproteins ( Gao and others 2003 ) . In addition to macrophages , SR - A1 receptors are also present on endothelial and smooth - muscle cells ( Pitas 1990 ; Mietus - Snyder and others 2000 ) . SR - A3 , also known as cellular stress - response protein ( CSR ) , is upregulated under oxidative stress conditions ( UV irradiation ) , and thus protects cells against oxidative stress by scavenging reactive oxygen species ( Han and others 1998 ) . Unlike to SR - A1 and MARCO , SR - A3 was found to localize in the cell cytoplasm of HeLa cells near the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) / Golgi complex ( Han and others 1998 ) . SR - A4 , a scavenger receptor with C - type lectin , is mainly expressed on endothelial cells , and contributes to innate immunity responses by recognizing microbes ( Nakamura and others 2001 ) . Importantly , SR - A4 binds only with oxidized LDLs , not acetylated LDLs ( Ohtani and others 2001 ) . SR - A5 is mainly expressed on fibroblasts and epithelial cells , and its expression was found to be particularly high in testis , lung , bladder , and small intestine ( Jiang and others 2006 ; Li and others 2009 ; DeWitte - Orr and others 2010 ) . In analogy to SR - A3 , SR - A5 localizes to the regions near the ER and TGN in CHO cells ( Jiang and others 2006 ) . SR - A5 has the capacity to bind bacteria , viral dsRNA , but not modified LDLs ( Jiang and others 2006 ; DeWitte - Orr and others 2010 ) . SR - A5 also functions as a receptor 32 of serum ferritin , and thus participates in transferrin - independent iron uptake ( Li and others 2009 ) . Recent studies have identified the possible role of SR - A3 and SR - A5 to act as tumor - suppressor genes . Low SR - A5 levels in human hepato - cellular carcinoma ( HCC ) have been linked with the progression of the disease ( Huang and others 2010b ) . In contrary , elevating the SR - A5 levels in HCC cells in vitro or in vivo mice model significantly suppressed the colony formation of the cells and tumor growth in mice . The molecular mechanism by which SR - A5 inhibit tumorigenesis was found to rely on its ability to bind focal adhesion kinase , and to suppress its phosphorylation ( Huang and others 2010b ) . Thera - peutic potential of SR - A5 was also confirmed in glioma and lung cancer models in vivo ( Yan and others 2012 ) . Over - expression of SR - A3 in mice with induced prostate cancer has resulted in decreased metastasis and inhibition of tumor growth ( Yu and others 2006 ; Zhu and others 2009 ) . In contrary , high SR - A3 levels in ovarian cancer are related with the progression of cancer ( Bock and others 2012 ) . The ability of cA - SR receptors to bind NAs made them an exceptionally important in regard of this thesis . Members of cA - SRs have been shown to bind polyribonucleotides ( Pearson and others 1993 ) , unmethylated CpG oligonucle - otides ( Jozefowski and others 2006 ) , dsDNA ( DeWitte - Orr and others 2010 ) , dsRNA ( Limmon and others 2008 ; Dieudonne and others 2012 ) , synthetic dsRNA ( Nellimarla and others 2015 ) , polyvalent oligonucleotide - functionalized gold nanoparticles ( Patel and others 2010 ) , and spherical nucleic acid nano - particles ( SNA ) ( Choi and others 2013 ) . Importantly , we demonstrated the involvement of two members of cA - SR , SR - A3 and SR - A5 , in the uptake of PF14 - SCO nanocomplexes ( Ezzat and others 2012 ) . Pre - treatment of HeLa pLuc705 cells with cA - SR competitive ligands poly - I and dextran sulfate , or simultaneous down - regulation of SR - A3 and SR - A5 with siRNAs , substantially decreased the binding and internalization as well as the biological effect of PF14 - SCO nanoparticles ( Ezzat and others 2012 ) . Furthermore , using trans - mission electron microscopy ( TEM ) , we demonstrated that both cA - SRs can directly bind PF14 - SCO nanocomplexes on the plasma membrane , and the col - ocalization was retained even after internalization inside the vesicles ( Juks and others 2015 ) . SRs are known to bind anionic ligands , however , the negative charge is not the only feature necessary for binding to cA - SRs . Prof . M . Krieger and his workgroup showed that cA - SRs bind and internalize with high efficiency negatively charged polyribonucleotides poly - I and poly - G . However , negatively charged but structurally distinct molecules poly - A and poly - C are not recog - nized by cA - SRs ( Pearson and others 1993 ) . It was found that poly - I and poly - G aggregate under physiological conditions and acquire a four - stranded helical structure . Poly - C and poly - A , in contrary , cannot assemble into such structures , suggesting that only aggregated forms of polyribonucleotides can bind cA - SRs ( Pearson and others 1993 ) . The requirement for distinct ligand structure was recently demonstrated by Choi and coworkers when studying the uptake of negatively charged SNAs ( Choi and others 2013 ) . The authors demonstrated 33 that SNA with three - dimensional architecture are efficiently recognized and endocytosed by cA - SRs , however , their linear counterparts did not show any affinity to cA - SRs ( Choi and others 2013 ) , demonstrating that in addition to negative charge the structure of the ligand is also a decisive feature to be recognized by cA - SRs . The mechanism by which SRs gain access into cells relies mainly on endocytosis , and all the major endocytic pathways have been implicated in their uptake , i . e clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( Chen and others 2006 ; Lunov and others 2011 ) , caveolin - mediated endocytosis ( Zhu and others 2011 ; Choi and others 2013 ) , and macropinocytosis ( Yao and others 2009 ) . Following the inter - nalization , receptor - ligand complex is thought to be dissociated under low - pH of endosomes , and the ligands are destined for degradation . Receptors are probably targeted to the plasma membrane through TGN to aid in further ligand bindings ( Murphy and others 2005 ) . 34 2 . AIMS OF THE STUDY The aim of the current thesis was to examine the cellular uptake and intra - cellular trafficking of negatively charged PF14 - SCO nanocomplexes with emphasis to class A scavenger receptors . Specific aims : 1 . To study the potential role of scavenger receptors in the uptake of PF14 - SCO nanocomplexes , by utilizing pharmacological inhibitors and RNAi in combination with microscopic approaches ( Paper I , II and III ) . 2 . In order to provide more insight into role of cA - SRs , to determine whether the PF14 - SCO nanocomplexes can directly interact with respective cA - SRs receptors on the plasma membrane ( Paper II and III ) . 3 . To elucidate the particular endocytosis mechanism ( s ) responsible for the uptake and functionality of PF14 - SCO nanocomplexes , as well as to examine the intracellular trafficking of the nanocomplexes ( Paper II and III ) . 4 . Since SR - A3 and SR - A5 are not present on the cell surface of control cells , to unravel the mechanisms that trigger the recruitment of SR - A3 and SR - A5 from the cell cytoplasm to the plasma membrane ( Paper IV ) . 35 3 . METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATION The methods used in the current thesis are described in detail in the respective papers included in the current thesis , and the following section only provides a brief overview of selected methods . 3 . 1 Cell lines Throughout the current thesis , the majority of the experiments were conducted on human cervical cancer cells , HeLa pLuc705 cell line , a kind gift from Prof . R . Kole ( Kang and others 1998 ) . HeLa pLuc705 cells are stably transfected with luciferase encoding plasmid that contains a mutated Î² - globin intron . The muta - tion causes aberrant splicing of luciferase mRNA and loss of functional lucifer - ase . However , targeting of splice - correcting oligonucleotides ( SCOs ) comple - mentary to the mutated region redirects the splicing - machinery and restores the production of the protein ( Figure 3 ) ( Kang and others 1998 ) . HeLa pLuc705 cell line is a commonly used in vitro model to evaluate the delivery efficiency of SCOs by CPPs in terms of splice - correction . In order to place our results in the broader context and to enable comparison with previously published results , the respective cell line was used in current study . Additionally , the human T lym - phocyte cell line , Jurkat cells were included into Paper IV as control for recruitment of receptors to the plasma membrane . All the cell - lines were grown at 37Â°C in humidified atmosphere containing 5 % CO 2 with the appropriate culture media supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum , and 200 U / mL penicillin and 200 Î¼ g / mL streptomycin . Figure 3 . Schematic illustration of splice - correction assay ( adopted from Said Hassane and others 2010 ) . Luciferase reporter gene is interrupted by insertion of human ï¢ - globine intron ( blue ) that carries point mutation at nucleotide position 705 . This mutation causes abberant splicing and loss of functional protein . Nuclear delivery of specific oligonucleotide , ON 705 , aigainst the mutated region redirects splicing - machin - ery and restores production of functional luciferase protein . 36 3 . 2 Used CPPs and oligonucleotides The current thesis aimed to elucidate the mechanisms of one of the effective SCO delivery vector , PepFect14 in more detail . The design of PF14 is based on stearyl - TP10 in which the lysines are replaced by ornithines and isoleucines are substituted with leucines . The idea of such modifications was based on earlier reports where the poly - L - ornithines possessed superior transfection efficiency over the poly - L - lysine based systems in terms of better nucleic acid binding and stable nanoparticle formation ( Ramsay and Gumbleton 2002 ) . Furthermore , as ornithine is a nonstandard amino acid , thus it would be less prone to degrad - ation by serum proteases , and therefore would also improve the stability of the nanocomplexes in the presence of serum . Additionally , in Paper IV also other amphipathic CPPs TP10 , PF6 , CADY and pepnetratin , and cationic R9 ( Table 2 ) were included to the study to assess their potency to recruit SR - A3 and SR - A5 to the plasma membrane . The phosphorothioate 2 ` OMe ( PS - 2 ` - OMe , 5 â² - CCU CUU ACC UCA GUU ACA - 3 â² ) SCO was used as a nucleic acid cargo molecule whose effect can be quantified in HeLa pLuc705 cells . Depending on the assay , the 5Â´ end of the oligonucleotide was labeled either with Cy5 or nanogold tag ( d = 1 . 4 nm ) , or was left unmodified . Table 2 . Examined CPPs and their sequences .

The non - covalent strategy is suit - able for negatively charged ONs , and therefore throughout the studies presented 37 in the current thesis , we used the non - covalent association strategy that relies on electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions of positively charged CPPs and neg - atively charged ONs to spontaneously form nanocomplexes . The noncovalent complexes were formed in a similar manner throughout the study . Briefly , PF14 and PS - 2 ` - OMe SCOs were co - incubated in MilliQ water at molar ratio ( MR ) 5 to achieve 1 ÂµM and 200 nM final concentrations , re - spectively . Complexes were formed at room temperature for 30 â 60 min , and subsequently , nanocomplexes were directly added to the cells grown in the presence or absence of serum and incubated for appropriate time periods . 3 . 4 Methods to study the involvement of cA - SRs in the cellular uptake of PF14 - SCO nanocomplexes 3 . 4 . 1 Pharmacological inhibition of SR - A3 and SR - A5 , and RNAi Scavenger receptors comprise a large supergroup of receptors with the ability to bind poly - anionic ligands ( Pearson and others 1993 ) . In order to assess whether the cA - SRs participate in the uptake of negatively charged PF14 - SCO nano - complexes , the effect of cA - SRs specific inhibitory ligands polyinosinic acid ( poly - I ) , dextran sulfate and fucoidan was examined on the cellular uptake and functionality of the nanocomplexes . The respective controls , polycytidylic acid ( poly - C ) , chondroitin sulfate and galactose are structurally similar to inhibitory ligands , although with no affinity against cA - SRs . The effect of the inhibitors on the association with cells and cellular uptake , or splice - correction activity and luciferase expression was examined with TEM or luminometer , respectively . Since the aforementioned inhibitors are not exclusively selective , we also used RNAi to down - regulate SR - A3 and SR - A5 . siRNAs for respective recep - tors were used as a mixture at 25 nM concentration of each , and were trans - fected into cells using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX . 24 or 48 h after the transfection with siRNAs , unlabeled or Cy5 labeled PF14 - SCO nancomplexes were added to the cells and the enzymatic activity of luciferase , or cellular uptake of the nanocomplexes was examined with luminometer , or FACS or fluorescence plate reader , respectively . 3 . 4 . 2 Confocal laser scanning microscopy ( CLSM ) Confocal laser scanning microscopy ( CLSM ) is quick and informative approach to examine the colocalization of the molecules of interest , and follow the trafficking and cellular localization of the nanoparticles in relation to cellular structures by using fluorescently labeled probes in both live and fixed cells . Therefore , in the current thesis CLSM was exploited for immunofluorescence experiments with specific antibodies in fixed cells , or to follow the trafficking of the nanocomplexes in relation to intracellular organelles in live cells . For immunofluorescence experiments , after treatment of cells with nanocomplexes 38 or SCOs for appropriate time , the cells were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) fixative in PBS and permeabilized with Triton X - 100 to allow the anti - bodies to reach their intracellular antigen . Thereafter , the cells were treated with respective primary and secondary antibody carrying fluorescent dyes . Finally , to preserve the morphology of the cells , cells were mounted with Fluoromount G . In order to retain the integrity of the plasma membrane and to visualize receptors only on the plasma membrane , cells were fixed with non - permeab - ilizing fixative by using 3 % PFA in 0 . 1 M phosphate buffer ( pH 7 . 4 ) . The intactness of the plasma membrane after fixation was controlled either by DNA - stain DAPI or lysosomal protein LAMP - 2 staining . If the cells were intact , DAPI could not pass the plasma membrane and stain the nucleus , and the inte - gral LAMP - 2 was not targeted to the plasma membrane . The CLSM images were captured with Olympus FluoView FV1000 confocal laser scanning microscope ( Olympus , Japan ) . 3 . 4 . 3 Transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) Although , CLSM is powerful and informative method for following the cellular localization and trafficking of the fluorescent molecules , the method still has some limitations . The resolution of optical microscopy does not allow to study the cellular structures and interactions of molecules in detailed manner . More - over , fluorescent dyes are susceptible for photobleaching that might decrease the signal . The high magnification and resolution provided by TEM can solve the issues related with CLSM , and therefore in order to provide more detailed data about the interactions with cells , i . e . cellular localization and interactions with receptors , this technique was used throughout the current study . In the cur - rent thesis , we utilized two different TEM methodologies - âclassicalâ TEM and immuno - TEM . For classical TEM analysis , we used nanocomplexes of PF14 with nanogold - labeled ( d = 1 . 4 nm ) SCO . After the transfection of the cells with the nanocomplexes for appropriate time , cells were fixed with 2 . 5 % glutaralde - hyde . Due to the small size of the gold - tag ( 1 . 4 nm ) it is not readily detectable by TEM , and thus the gold tag was enlarged by silver deposition for better visu - alization . After the silver enhancement , specimens were post - fixed with 1 % OsO 4 and dehydrated with ethanol series . Finally , specimens were flat - embed - ded in epoxy resin and ultrathin sections from the resin were cut . Images were captured at 100 kV accelerating voltage on JEM - 100S ( JEOL , Japan ) TEM . To confirm the results obtained with confocal microscopy and in order to examine the interactions of SR - A3 / SR - A5 and PF14 - SCO nanocomplexes more precisely , we used the immuno - TEM and labeled the receptors and nano - complexes with colloidal gold tags with different sizes . Such labeling allowed us to simultaneously detect the nanocomplexes and receptors , map their cellular distribution , and ascertain whether the nanocomplexes can associate with respective receptors directly , i . e . whether they reside in close proximity . Briefly , SCOs labeled with 10 nm colloidal gold were complexed with PF14 , and the 39 receptors were labeled with the respective primary antibodies and secondary antibodies labeled with 6 nm colloidal gold particle . As 6 and 10 nm labels can be easily distinguished under TEM , no silver enhancement is required . In order to preserve the ultrastructure of the cells and the antigenicity of the antibodies , instead of classical fixation for TEM with 2 . 5 % glutaraldehyde , we used milder PLP ( paraformaldehyde - lysine - periodate ) fixative and permeabilization with 0 . 01 % saponin . Images were captured at 120 kV accelerating voltage on FEI Tecnai G2 Spirit ( FEI , The Netherlands ) TEM . 3 . 5 Methods to study the cellular uptake mechanism and intracellular trafficking of PF14 - SCO nanocomplexes 3 . 5 . 1 Cellular uptake experiments The most common methods to study the cellular uptake of nanocomplexes are the inhibition of respective pathways by pharmacological inhibition of endo - cytosis , or RNAi . In the current thesis we used the both methods . Among the pharmacological inhibitors , nystatin was used to inhibit the caveolin - dependent endocytosis , amiloride or EIPA to interfere with macropinocytosis and chlor - promazine to inhibit CME . The effect of the endocytosis inhibitors on the splice - correction activity of the nanocomplexes was examined by measuring the luciferase expression with luminometer . The effect of down - regulation of cavoeolin - 1 with specific siRNA on the cellular uptake of Cy5 labeled PF14 - SCO nanocomplexes was examined by using fluorescence plate reader . In order to better visualize the induction of macropinocytosis and caveolin - dependent endocytosis , we analyzed the colocalization of Cy5 - labeled PF14 - SCO nanocomplexes with fluorescently tagged 70 kDa dextran in live cells ; or staining caveolin - 1 in fixed cells by specific antibody , respectively . All the images were captured with CLSM and quantified with FluoView1000 program ( Olympus ) . 3 . 5 . 2 Intracellular trafficking of PF14 - SCO nanocomplexes In order to unravel the intracellular trafficking and destination of PF14 - SCO nanocomplexes after internalization , we mapped the localization of nano - complexes in relation to acidic / degradative vesicles , Golgi network and endo - plasmic reticulum ( ER ) by fluorescence microscopy . Trafficking of nanocomplexes or SCOs along the endo - lysosomal pathway was examined with pH sensitive probe LysoSensor DND . The fluorescence intensity of the probe rises gradually as the pH of the vesicle drops , and thus the change in fluorescence intensity allows us to estimate the acidity of the vesicles containing PF14 - SCO nanocomplexes . Additionally , to assess whether the nanocomplexes are targeted to lysosomes , final destinations in endo - lysosomal 40 pathway , immunofluorescence experiment against lysosomal membrane protein LAMP - 2 was conducted . In order to determine whether the PF14 - SCO nanocomplexes enter the recycling pathway for being exocytosed , we mapped their localization in relation to trans - Golgi network with a TGN46 specific antibody or fluorescently labeled ceramide in fixed and live cells , respectively . Localization of complexes to ER was mapped with fluorescently labeled ER marker Blue - White DPX . 41 4 . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 4 . 1 Involvement of scavenger receptors in the cellular uptake of PF14 - SCO nanocomplexes ( Paper I , III ) It has been expected that due to the cationic nature of the CPPs and its molar excess over ONs in nanoparticle formulation , the CPP - ON nanoparticles pos - sess positive charge that enables interactions with negatively charged plasma membrane components and subsequent entry into cells in analogy with ânakedâ CPPs . Nevertheless , recently it was demonstrated that PF14 - SCO nanocom - plexes have negative zeta potential ( Ezzat and others 2011 ) . The anionic nature of the nanocomplexes should repel them from the plasma membrane , however , PF14 - SCO nanocomplexes still exhibit high splice - correcting activity . This finding hints that the internalization of PF14 - SCO might be assisted by some receptors . Therefore , in Paper I we aimed to elucidate the possible receptor / binding partners that facilitate the internalization of PF14 - SCO nanocomplexes . At first we aimed to examine the changes in zeta - potential in more detail in different environments . We found that in MilliQ water , where the nanoparticles are initially formed , the zeta - potential was highly dependent on the molar ratio of the nanocomplexes . At MR3 nanocomplexes were negatively charged , but at MR5 or MR10 , nanocomplexes acquired nearly neutral or positive charge , respectively . However , in the presence of serum or in NaCl solution , nanoparti - cles were negatively charged at all MRs tested in this paper , suggesting that the negative zeta potential is not barely determined by negatively charged serum components , but rather by the salts and pH of the environment . Further , we shifted our focus on the elucidation of the possible receptors that might contribute to the uptake of PF14 - SCO nanocomplexes . One of the prob - able candidates were class A scavenger receptors with their ability to bind poly - anionic ligands ( Pearson and others 1993 ) . Importantly , cA - SRs also exhibit promiscuous binding of variety of nucleic acids ( Pearson and others 1993 ; DeWitte - Orr and others 2010 ; Patel and others 2010 ) . First , we conducted a pilot experiment with well - known cA - SR inhibitory ligands poly - I , dextran sul - fate and fucoidan , which binding to receptors should interfere with the associa - tion of other possible ligands . Poly - C , chondroitin sulfate and galactose were used as respective negative controls . These molecules are chemically related with inhibitory ligands , however , have no affinity for cA - SRs . Pre - incubation of HeLa pLuc705 cells with inhibitory ligands substantially decreased the splice - correction activity of PF14 - SCO in a concentration - dependent manner . Poly - I and fucoidan at 25 Âµg / mL and 5 Âµg / mL concentration , respectively , almost completely blocked the activity of PF14 - SCO nanocomplexes . The most potent inhibitory ligand was dextran sulfate , yielded in more than 80 % of reduction in luciferase expression already as low as at 0 . 5 Âµg / mL concentrations , and at 5 Âµg / mL concentration the activity of PF14 - SCO was completely abolished . Con - versely , respective negative control compounds did not affect the uptake and functionality of the nanaocomplexes . Furthermore , to confirm the effect of the 42 cA - SR inhibitors on the cellular association and uptake of nanocomplexes , we used TEM . In control cells , PF14 - SCO complexes were abundantly associated with cells and already after 1 h , nanocomplexes had entered the cells where they located mainly in endosomal vesicles . However , in concordance with splice - correction assay , pre - treatment of cells with dextran - sulfate almost completely blocked the association and internalization of the complexes to cells , whereas the pre - treatment with chondroitin sulfate did not affect the ability of complexes to bind and internalize to cells . Collectively , these results demonstrate that when cA - SRs are not available for ligand binding at the cell surface , i . e . the sites for ligand docking on the receptor are already occupied ; association of PF14 - SCO nanoparticles with cells and subsequent entry into cells are abolished . 4 . 1 . 1 SR - A3 and SR - A5 are the binding partners for PF14 - SCO nanoparticles After verifying that the cA - SR inhibitory ligands compete with and block the binding of nanocomplexes to cA - SRs , our next aim was to identify whether the HeLa pLuc705 cells express the cA - SRs at all , and if they do so , which type of cA - SRs participate in the uptake of PF14 - SCO nanocomplexes . Using the real - time PCR , we found that only two members of cA - SRs , SR - A3 and SR - A5 , are expressed in HeLa pLuc705 cells . The participation of the respective receptors in functionality of nanocomplexes was further verified by RNAi experiment . We found that simultaneous knock - down of SR - A3 and SR - A5 substantially decreased the splice - correcting activity of the complexes , yielding in slightly more than 50 % of reduction in luciferase expression . However , the pharmaco - logical cA - SR inhibitors yielded in substantially higher inhibition rates . Such moderate effect of cA - SR downregulation to cell entry of ONs has also been observed in earlier studies ( Patel and others 2010 ; Saleh and others 2006 ) , and might suggest that multiple receptors with overlapping functions participate in uptake of nanocomplexes . We speculate that the residual activity of nanocom - plexes after RNAi might be due to rapid regeneration of the receptors pool after down - regulation , or other scavenger or pattern recognition receptors might par - ticipate in the uptake . Recently , it was found that the uptake of PF14 analogue , PF32 , into brain endothelial cells and across the blood - brain barrier model besides to SR - A3 and SR - A5 , is also dependent on SR - B1 receptors ( Srimanee and others 2016 ) . The possible involvement of SRs form other classes during the uptake of PF14 - SCO needs still to be further tested . In brief , the results from inhibition assay and RNAi strongly support the involvement of SR - A3 and SR - A5 in the uptake of PF14 - SCO nanocomplexes . 43 4 . 1 . 2 PF14 - SCO nanocomplexes colocalize with SR - A3 and SR - A5 In order to assess whether the nanoparticles can associate with respective receptors , we analyzed the colocalization of SR - A3 / - A5 and PF14 - SCO nano - complexes by immunofluorescence assay . Here , the Cy5 labeled SCOs were complexed with PF14 , and SR - A3 and SR - A5 were visualized with SCARA3 and SCARA5 antibodies and respective fluorescently - labeled secondary anti - bodies . After 1 h of incubation , the nanocomplexes showed prevalent colocali - zation with SR - A3 and SR - A5 on the plasma membrane , however , the colocali - zation was found to be more prominent under 4ÂºC , a condition that avoids the endocytosis . Moreover , the colocalization was retained even inside the cells in vesicles , corroborating the fact that SR - A3 and SR - A5 participate in the uptake of the nanocomplexes . Still , the overlap was not complete and the SR - AÂ´s sig - nal appeared only at the edges of the nanoparticles that might be due to the large size of the complexes and localization of receptors in one site . Surprisingly , the naked SCO at high concentration ( 1 ÂµM ) , but not at nano - molar range ( 200 nM ) , showed also a substantial colocalization with both receptors . Moreover , the naked SCO at as high as 5 ÂµM concentration induced more than 3 - fold increase in luciferase expression compared to untreated cells . However , the naked SCO is still by far less efficient in switching splicing than in complexes with PF14 that induced more that 120 - fold increase in luciferase activity compared to untreated cells . As the binding with cA - SRs is also dependent on the structure of the ligand , it is likely that at higher concentrations SCOs starts to form aggregates ( Ezzat and others 2015 ) , which is an essential structural feature for binding to cA - SRs ( Pearson and others 1993 ) . Still the question remains , what gives the overall negative charge of the nanocomplexes ? The nanoparticles obtained negative zeta - potential also in the absence of serum , thus , the negative charge is not a result of adsorption of anionic serum proteins , but must be determined by other factors . Previously , it has been shown that the binding of oligonucleotide - functionalized gold nano - particles ( DNA - Au - NP ) to cA - SRs is highly dependent on the density of DNA exposed on the surface of nanoparticles ( Patel and others 2010 ) . During the examination of the effect of SR inhibitory ligands on nanoparticles with differ - ent amount of DNA molecules , the authors revealed that reducing the density of DNA on nanoparticles reduced the inhibitory effect as well as the uptake of the nanocomplexes . They suggested that the dense monolayer of DNA around the nanoparticle mimics the helical structure of cA - SR inhibitory ligands , i . e . poly - I ( Pearson and others 1993 ) , and thus facilitates association with scavenger recep - tors ( Patel and others 2010 ) . Similarly , the dense oligonucleotide shell of spherical nucleic acids ( SNAs ) contributes to the uptake via cA - SRs ( Choi and others 2013 ) . According to published papers and our results , it is tempting to speculate that during the nanoparticle formulation , SCOs are partially exposed on the surface of the nanoparticles that gives the overall negative charge and facilitates recognition by SR - A3 and SR - A5 receptors . 44 4 . 2 Cell entry mechanism and intracellular trafficking of PF14 - SCO nanocomplexes ( Paper II , III ) In paper II , we focused on the uptake mechanisms and intracellular trafficking of PF14 - SCO nanocomplexes . There is no unique or universal mechanism for cellular uptake of CPPs , and frequently more than one internalization pathway is exploited simultaneously . Moreover , SRs can induce their internalization via all common endocytic pathways . In order to elucidate the exact uptake mecha - nism and subsequent cellular destination for PF14 - SCO nanocomplexes , we used a combination of confocal - and electron microscopy techniques to map their localization in relation to cellular structures . 4 . 2 . 1 Binding to SR - A3 and SR - A5 induces uptake via macropinocytosis and caveolin - dependent endocytosis In Paper I , using TEM , we demonstrated that after internalization the PF14 - SCO nanocomplexes reside mainly in vesicular structures , suggesting that the internalization of the nanocomplexes occurs mainly via endocytosis , however , we did not elucidate the exact mechanism . The most common methods to determine the endocytic pathway ( s ) along which the material is internalized into cells relies mainly on different pharmacological inhibitors of endocytosis , or RNAi to knock - down specific proteins involved in respective pathways . Since SRs can induce their entry into cells via all endocytic pathways described so far , i . e . CME , caveolin - dependent endocytosis and macropinocytosis , and in order to determine which one ( s ) contribute the activity of PF14 - SCO nancomplexes , we first utilized a set of pharmacological inhibitors . We ascertained that the inhibition of macropinocytosis with EIPA reduced the splice - correction activity of nanocomplexes by about 80 % , and nystatin , an inhibitor of caveolin - depend - ent endocytosis , yielded in 30 % drop of luciferase activity . However , inhibition of CME , the main entry route for receptor - mediated endocytosis , did not affect the activity of the nanocomplexes at all . To further confirm the minor role of caveolin - dependent entry route , we knocked down caveolin - 1 and assessed its effect on the uptake of PF14 - SCO nanocomplexes . In concordance with inhibi - tory assay , down - regulation of caveolin - 1 substantially reduced the uptake of the nanocomplexes of PF14 and Cy5 labeled SCOs , and yielded in 40 % of reduction compared to untreated cells , or cells treated with non - targeted siRNA . Since the inhibition of endocytic routes with pharmacological inhibitors is not very specific , and in order to further validate the results , colocalization of PF14 - SCO nanoparticles with 70 kDa dextran and caveolin - 1 , markers for macropinocytosis and caveolae respectively , was examined . The nanocom - plexes showed substantial colocalization with both markers at the plasma mem - brane as well as inside the cells in vesicular structures , corroborating the involvement of macropinocytosis and caveolin - dependent endocytosis in their uptake . 45 Macropinocytosis and caveolin - dependent endocytosis are also prevalent uptake routes for PF14 - pDNA nanocomplexes ( Veiman and others 2013 ) , as well as for other TP10 analogue , NickFects with pDNA ( Arukuusk and others 2013 ) . Collectively , our results demonstrate that at least two cell entry mechanisms , macropinocytosis and caveolin - mediated endocytosis , are active in parallel during the uptake of PF14 - SCO . 4 . 2 . 2 PF14 - SCO nanocomplexes do not enter the recycling pathway After being internalized , endocytosed material is being subsequently sorted and directed to its final destination mainly via two major intracellular pathways : endosomal recycling pathway that directs the cargo back to the plasma mem - brane , or endo - lysosomal pathway to target the material to lysosomes for degra - dation . The exact internalization pathway might also influence the final destina - tion of the payload . For example , CT and SV40 that are internalized via caveo - lae are directly trafficked to the Golgi apparatus and ER ( Pelkmans and others 2001 ; Le and Nabi 2003 ) . An interesting finding was recently published by Sahay et al , who showed that after internalization via macropinocytosis siRNA - LNP nanoparticles are directly targeted to late endosomes where siRNA is dis - sociated from the LNP , and is subsequently recycled back to the plasma mem - brane ( Sahay and others 2013 ) . Moreover , after internalization , cA - SRs reach the TGN , where they are packed into secretory vesicles and are trafficked to the plasma membrane ( Mori and others 1994 ) . In order to assess the role of re - cycling pathway , the localization of Cy5 labeled SCO and PF14 nanocomplexes were mapped in relation to Golgi apparatus either with antibody - staining against TGN46 ( trans - Golgi network protein ) , or fluorescently labeled ceramide in time dependent manner . Here , we found that only a negligible fraction of internalized nanocomplexes colocalized with TGN46 or ceramide after 30 min , and in time after 1 h , the number was even decreased , and only about 1 % of the total inter - nalized complexes showed colocalization with Golgi markers . Thus , PF14 - SCO nanocomplexes avoid targeting to Golgi apparatus and recycling pathway after internalization , and other pathways might contribute to the cellular trafficking of the nanocomplexes . Additionally , we also did not observe any colocalization of nanocomplexes with ER marker . 4 . 2 . 3 . PF14 - SCO nanocomplexes avoid targeting to lysosomes The other major intracellular route is the endo - lysosomal pathway that targets the endocytosed material through gradually acidified vesicles , and it finally terminates in lysosomes where the payload is degraded . The acidity of the intra - cellular vesicles can be monitored with pH sensitive probe LysoSensor . Lyso - Sensor enters the cells via endocytosis and its fluorescence intensity depends on the pH of the vesicles , i . e . the more acidic vesicles emit brighter fluorescence 46 signal than vesicles with neutral or slightly acidic pH . Trafficking of the Cy5 labeled PF14 - SCO nanocomplexes through endo - lysosomal pathway was mon - itored in time and the results were compared with the naked SCO . After 1 h , majority of the internalized complexes were mainly located in cell periphery in rather non - acidic vesicles that lacked LysoSensor signal . However , further in time , the complexes - containing vesicles had increased in size and moved deeper into the cells , but still the majority of them did not colocalize with LysoSensor , and only very rare colocalization with LysoSensor - positive vesicles was observed after 4 h . Moreover , no significant colocalization was detected for lysosomal protein LAMP - 1 and PF14 - SCO nanocomplexes over 4 h examina - tion time , suggesting that PF14 - SCO avoid targeting to acidic lysosomes , and they are mainly retained in non - acidic or slightly acidic early / late endosomes , at least during the time window examined in the current thesis . This result is also in good concordance with the results obtained with pharmacological inhibitors of endocytosis . The endocytic vesicles derived from caveolae are considered to give rise to intracellular vesicles with rather neutral pH due to the slower matu - ration rate ; and thus , this might provide an opportunity to retain the functional - ity of the SCO and promote the endosomal escape before reaching the highly acidic lysosomes . These results are also well in line with earlier results from our laboratory . RÃ¤Ã¤gel et al showed that the internalization of CPP - protein com - plexes , specifically TP - avidin constructs are partially sequestered into non - or slightly acidic vesicles ( RÃ¤Ã¤gel and others 2009 ) . Here , the authors also sug - gested that the vesicles with slightly acidic interior were probably derived from caveolae - dependent pathway , as the caveolin - dependent entry route is the main uptake mechanism for TP - protein complexes ( SÃ¤Ã¤lik and others 2009 ) . In anal - ogy with this and our current results , also spherical nucleic acids ( SNA ) that enter the cells via cA - SR and caveolin - dependent manner ( Choi and others 2013 ) are not targeted to acidic lysosomes , but rather reside in slightly acidic early / late endosomes , even over 24 h study - time ( Wu and others 2014 ) . However , unlike to nanocomplexes , naked SCOs at 1 ÂµM concentration were trafficked to acidic vesicles already within 2 h , as confirmed by LysoSen - sor and LAMP - 1 staining . Further in time , even higher proportion of the SCOs were sequestered into acidic vesicles , and after 4 h the majority of internalized SCOs showed intense colocalization with LAMP - 1 . In order to pinpoint the time frame after which the nanoparticles start to escape from endososomes , we mapped their cellular localization in time by using TEM . We found out that already after 30 min of incubation , some of the nanocomplexes had entered the cells and located in endosomal vesicles , most commonly in MVBs . Further in time , the number of the nanocomplexes that had entered the cells was even increased , and starting from 1 h we could also detect vesicles with discontinuous membranes and escape of the nanocomplexes to the cytosol . However , over 4 h of incubation time only few gold - labeled SCOs had reached the nucleus where they can redirect splicing . In order to estimate the efficiency of endosomal escape , we counted the number of total internalized nanocomplexes and the fraction that reached the cytosol . We found 47 that the vast majority of the nanocomplexes remain entrapped in endosomes , and the cytosolic fraction accounts only for 8 % of the total internalized nano - complexes , corroborating data from earlier reports and suggesting that only tiny amount of nanocomplexes could reach the cytosol , and the endosomal escape is still the major hurdle in ON - based therapies ( Gilleron and others 2013 ; Sahay and others 2013 ; Wittrup and others 2015 ) . Even though , in Paper I we deline - ated that naked SCO at as high as 5 ÂµM concentration is able to promote splice - switching and restoration of luciferase expression , still the small amount of SCO that reached the cell interior remained entrapped in endosomes and no endosomal escape or nuclear localization was detected by TEM after 4 h . Collectively , these results suggest that PF14 helps to interfere with the acidi - fication of the endosomes and promotes endosomal escape of the SCO . 4 . 2 . 4 SR - A3 and SR - A5 are recruited to the plasma membrane after exposure to PF14 - SCO nanocomplexes In parallel with the examination of the uptake and intracellular trafficking of PF14 - SCO nanocomplexes , we also aimed to analyze their interactions with receptors more precisely , i . e . we aimed to find out whether the nanocomplexes can directly bind with SR - A3 and SR - A5 . Although , in Paper I we already demonstrated the colocalization between the receptors and nanocomplexes by confocal microscopy , however , the resolution provided by fluorescence micros - copy is by far too low to provide detailed information about their actual inter - actions . Therefore , to solve the issue , we used high resolution TEM to examine the interactions in more detail . For the analysis we used two gold labels with different sizes : the receptors were labeled with respective primary antibodies and secondary antibodies that carried 6 nm colloidal gold tag , and nanocom - plexes with 10 nm gold tag . After 1 h of incubation , we found that both , SR - A3 and SR - A5 reside in close proximity to nanocomplexes on the plasma mem - brane as well as after internalization in endosomal vesicles , suggesting that nanocomplexes can directly interact with respective receptors . Moreover , we could detect only 2 â 3 gold - labeled receptors near the complexes . This result is in good concordance with confocal microscopy results from Paper I where we detected only partial overlap of nanocomplexes with receptors , suggesting that only a few receptors are required for efficient association and internalization of the PF14 - SCO nanocomplexes . To our surprise , we discovered that SR - A3 and SR - A5 are not exposed on the plasma membrane of uninduced control cells , but are recruited there after exposure to PF14 - SCO nanocomplexes . Still , their intracellular concentration in control cells is rather high , where receptors are mainly found in small vesicles near the plasma membrane , or more centrally in the cell cytoplasm . This phe - nomenon was also confirmed by confocal microscopy . Two of the earlier reports have shown that in addition to the temporal presence on the plasma membrane , SR - A3 and SR - A5 are mostly localized inside the cells near the ER - 48 Golgi complex region in HeLa and CHO cells , respectively ( Han and others 1998 ; Jiang and others 2006 ) . Many other reports have also demonstrated that in the presence of ligands , cA - SRs are overexpressed ( Mietus - Snyder and others 2000 ; Fukuhara - Takaki and others 2005 ) . However , these papers do not shed light to their initial localization , i . e . whether the receptors were constantly present on the plasma membrane and the presence of ligands just recruits more of them there , or receptors are absent from the plasma membrane and are recruited there after ligand induction . In the present study we showed for the first time that PF14 - SCO nanocomplexes induce the translocation of SR - A3 and SR - A5 from their cytoplasmic localization to the plasma membrane of HeLa pLuc705 cells to assist in binding and internalization of the nanocomplexes . 4 . 3 Mechanisms behind cell surface recruitment of SR - A3 and SR - A5 ( Paper IV ) In Paper IV , we aimed to further delineate the mechanisms behind the cell sur - face recruitment of SR - A3 and SR - A5 . The majority of the papers published in the field of SRs are mainly concentrated on their ability to bind and internalize different ligands , or the consequences of their down or up - regulation . Still , only few studies have addressed the mechanisms that regulate the cellular localiz - ation of SR - As . In this paper we concentrated on the role of calcium and PI3K , well - known regulators of vesicular trafficking and exocytosis , in the cell surface recruitment of SR - A3 and SR - A5 . 4 . 3 . 1 SR - A3 and SR - A5 are recruited to the plasma membrane by CPPs Recently , an interesting discovery was made by Lindberg and co - workers , who demonstrated that when the binding sites of SR - A3 and SR - A5 are blocked with inhibitory ligands , the uptake of fluorescently labeled PF14 is diminished ( Lindberg and others 2015 ) , suggesting that PF14 on its own can interact with these receptors . To our surprise , we found that PF14 alone is also able to trigger the translocation of receptors from the cytoplasm to the cell surface , contra - dicting the fact that SRs can bind only anionic ligands . Moreover , similar phe - nomenon was also observed with other amphipathic CPPs like TP10 , PF6 , CADY and penetratin , as well as with cationic CPP R9 . Our workgroup has previously demonstrated that during the cellular uptake of amphipathic CPPs such as MAP and TP , the plasma membrane is temporarily reorganized at the level that enables the influx of calcium ions into cells which in turn activate the membrane repair responses ( Lorents and others 2012 ) . Since TP10 , the parent peptide of PF14 , and PF14 itself are membrane - active peptides , we investigated , whether the mobilization of SR - A3 and SR - A5 from their intracellular locations to the cell surface is caused by the temporal breaches of the lipid bilayer induced by PF14 . Moreover , recently we showed that not all the CPP molecules 49 are associated with ONs into nanoparticles ( Arukuusk and others 2013 ) , but there is also a fraction of free peptide that might concentrate on the plasma membrane and cause its permeabilization . In order to assess the effect of PF14 to the integrity of the plasma membrane , we examined whether PF14 is able to induce the plasma membrane repair response . Plasma membrane repair response is activated by influx of calcium ions through the damaged site of the plasma membrane that increases the cytosolic calcium concentration , and subsequently induces the exocytosis of intracellular vesicles , and usually the membranes of lysosomes are used for the replacement of damaged regions of the plasma membrane ( Jaiswal and others 2002 ) . Thus , detection of the lysosomal protein LAMP - 2 on the plasma membrane allowed us to estimate the integrity of the plasma membrane . As a result , we confirmed that PF14 did not interfere with the integrity of the plasma membrane at the level to induce influx of calcium ions and subsequent recruitment of LAMP - 2 to the plasma membrane , even at as high as 4 ÂµM peptide concentration . Collectively , this excludes the possibil - ity that SR - A3 and SR - A5 are mobilized to the plasma membrane as a result of the damaged membrane , but rather is more indirectly regulated process . 4 . 3 . 2 Extra - and intracellular calcium ions are essential for both , the cell surface recruitment of SR - A3 and SR - A5 and internalization of PF14 - SCO nanoparticles Still , the calcium ions are ubiquitous intracellular signaling molecules that have central role in a multiple signal transduction pathways that control a variety of cellular processes , among which the regulation of intracellular membrane traf - ficking is the most relevant regarding this study . Calcium concentration is kept relatively low in intracellular environment , however , its effect on multiple of processes reveals when its concentration increases . The most well - studied cal - cium - dependent membrane fusion process is regulated exocytosis that occurs in neuronal cells in response to high intracellular calcium concentration to target the receptors to the plasma membrane , or to secrete hormones and neurotrans - mitters into extracellular space ( Burgoyne and Morgan 1998 ) . However , cal - cium - dependent exocytosis also occurs in non - secreting cells ( Jaiswal and others 2002 ; Coorssen and others 1996 ; Burgoyne and Clague 2003 ) . For exam - ple , calmodulin , a calcium - binding protein , is required for transferrin receptor recycling ( Apodaca and others 1994 ; Hunziker 1994 ) , suggesting the role of calcium to trigger the trafficking of the receptors between the cell interior and the plasma membrane . Since calcium plays an essential role in intracellular membrane trafficking , we hypothesized that the calcium ions could also trigger the trafficking of SR - A3 and SR - A5 and their insertion into the plasma mem - brane . The requirement for calcium ions for the cell surface recruitment of receptors and biological activity of the nanocomplexes was analyzed by depletion of calcium ions from the extra - or intracellular environment with calcium chelators EGTA or BAPTA - AM , respectively . Indeed , pre - treatment of 50 HeLa pLuc705 cells with EGTA or BAPAT - AM before the addition of PF14 - SCO nanocomplexes substantially impeded the trafficking of receptors form intracellular pool to the plasma membrane . This effect was even higher under conditions where extra - and intracellular calcium ions were depleted simultane - ously . Depletion of calcium not only reduced the number of cell surface recep - tors , but also decreased the number of nanoparticles interacting with the cells , as well as reduced the luciferase activity of PF14 - SCO nanocomplexes . EGTA and BAPTA - AM treatment reduced the luciferase activity by about 60 % and 30 % , respectively . These results demonstrate that calcium ions are critical regulators that control the cellular localization of SR - A3 and SR - A5 . Still , elevation of intracellular calcium concentration with ionophore on its own was not sufficient to trigger the translocation of SR - A3 and SR - A5 to the plasma membrane , sug - gesting that rather quick and local increase in calcium concentration triggers the mobilization of receptors to the plasma membrane . It is also possible that cal - cium ions are not the sole players in this process , and probably other regulators are necessary as well . 4 . 3 . 3 Recruitment of SR - A3 and SR - A5 to cell surface is dependent on PI3K and actin cytoskeleton Phosphatidylinositol - 3 kinase ( PI3K ) activity is required for regulation of vari - ous cellular processes , including endocytosis , intracellular vesicle trafficking , and exocytosis ( Corvera 2001 ; Lindmo and Stenmark 2006 ) . Numerous studies have demonstrated that PI3K activity is crucial for cell surface localization of various transmembrane receptors , for example GLUT - 4 and transferrin recep - tors ( Yang and others 1996 ; Spiro and others 1996 ; van Dam and others 2002 ) . Moreover , the activity of PI3K is necessary for SR - A1 localization to the cell surface during macrophage adhesion , as demonstrated by using PI3K specific inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 treatment ( Nikolic and others 2007 ; Cholewa and others 2010 ) . Furthermore recruitment of class B scavenger recep - tor SR - B1 from cytoplasmic pool to the plasma membrane in adipocytes and hepatocytes requires active PI3K ( Tondu and others 2005 ; Shetty and others 2006 ) , suggesting that PI3K activity is crucial for targeting of different SRs to the plasma membrane . Inspired by these results , we hypothesized that the activ - ity of PI3K is also essential for regulation of SR - A3 and SR - A5 levels on cell surface . Treatment of cells with wortmannin or LY294002 significantly de - creased the cell surface recruitment of respective receptors as well as reduced the splice - correction activity of the nanocomplexes , yielding in about 20 % and 30 % reduction of luciferase activity , respectively . These results demonstrate that activation of PI3K is also required for the regulation of SR - A3 and SR - A5 receptors localization . Moreover , PI3K activity in cells can be controlled by calcium ions ( Danciu and others 2003 ; Liu and others 2007 ) that we also discovered to be crucial for the trafficking of SR - A3 and SR - A5 from cyto - plasm to cell surface . PI3K is also an important regulator of actin cytoskeleton 51 and one of the key regulators in macropinocytosis ( Clague and others 1995 ; Araki and others 1996 ) , the latter of which is the major internalization mecha - nism for PF14 - SCO nanocomplexes . In addition to calcium ions and PI3K activity , we delineated that the efficient translocation of SR - A3 and SR - A5 to the plasma membrane relies on intact actin cytoskeleton - disruption of the actin cytoskeleton with Lantruculin B or Cytochalasin D exerted a negative effect on the cell surface recruitment of the receptors . However , microtubules did not seem to be important , since their destabilization did not decrease the number of SR - A3 and SR - A5 on the plasma membrane . Collectively , our results demonstrate that the recruitment of SR - A3 and SR - A5 to the cell surface is highly regulated process that requires calcium ions , active PI3K and intact actin cytoskeleton . 4 . 3 . 4 Localization of SR - A3 and SR - A5 to cell surface , but not internalization is dependent on serum proteins To our surprise we also found that in the presence of serum higher amount of the SR - A3 and SR - A5 receptors are targeted to the plasma membrane after nanoparticle treatment compared to the serum - free conditions . Negatively charged molecules are abundant in serum and could be possible ligands for SRs , and thus , this might help to explain why in the presence of serum more of SR - A3 and SR - A5 are found on the plasma membrane . However , with or without the serum , in Paper I we showed that PF14 - SCO nanoparticles possess a nega - tive net charge , â 12 . 1 Â± 1 . 41 in serum - containing media , and â 14 . 62 Â± 1 . 49 in the absence of serum ( Ezzat and others 2012 ) , suggesting that the negative charge is not determined by anionic serum components . Besides , nanoparticles in serum - free media produced slightly higher splice - correction effect than in serum containing media . However , the size of the nanocomplexes differs greatly depending on the used media . In the absence of serum , nanoparticles are much bigger than in serum - containing media ( 623 . 16 Â±79 . 69 in the absence of serum and 363 . 8 Â± 52 in the presence of serum as measured by dynamic light scatter - ing ) , suggesting that adsorption of serum proteins onto nanoparticles prevents the formation of agglomerates and thus , might help to pack the PF14 - SCO nanocomplexes into smaller particles and mask their surface . Thus , one might speculate that the bigger particles are more prone to interfere with the integrity of cellular membranes , and thereby promote their internalization / endosomal escape more easily . Additionally , we also determined that independently of the presence or absence of serum , the nanocomplexes follow the same cell - entry routes : macropinocytosis and caveolae - mediated endocytosis . Although , less receptors were targeted to the plasma membrane by PF14 - SCO nanocomplexes under serum - free conditions , knock - down of SR - A3 and SR - A5 by siRNA sup - pressed the uptake of the nanocomplexes in both media . Still , in the presence of serum the down - regulation of both receptors lead to stronger reduction in cel - lular uptake of nanocomplexes than in serum - free media . 52 One important factor that affects the biological fate of the nanoparticles is the protein corona . Upon administration of the nanocomplexes to biorelevant media , proteins of body fluid start to quickly adsorb onto the nanoparticles by forming a protein corona that strongly influences the interactions with cell , organs and immune system ( Monopoli and others 2012 ; Kelly and others 2015 ) . Generally , it is believed that protein corona hinders the binding of the nano - complexes to specific target receptors ( Mirshafiee and others 2013 ; Salvati and others 2013 ) , but there are also some contradictive claims ( Caracciolo and others 2013 ; Mortimer and others 2014 ; Fleischer and Payne 2014 ; Pozzi and others 2015 ; Palchetti and others 2016 ) . For example , apolipoproteins ( APO ) such as APOA1 and - A2 , APOB , APOC2 / 3 , APOH , vitamin K dependent pro - tein , integrin beta3 , Ig heavy chain V â III regions are considered to promote the association of different nanoparticles with cells ( Palchetti and others 2016 ; Pozzi and others 2014 and 2015 ) . APOs are the main components of lipopro - teins such as LDLs and high density lipoproteins , and thus are recognizable by several lipoprotein receptors on the cell surface ( Pozzi and others 2014 ) . Additionally , APOC3 can promote also interactions with class B scavenger receptors ( Pozzi and others 2015 ) . Inter - alpha trypsin inhibitor is a hyaluronan binding protein , a major constituent of the extracellular matrix that might pro - mote interactions with cells , and thereby also facilitate the interaction of nano - particles with cell surface receptors and their internalization into cells ( Pozzi and others 2015 ) . As already mentioned , in addition to the negative charge , ligand binding to cA - SRs also requires a specific structure : a four stranded helix . The growing number of papers in the field of protein corona has pointed to the fact that proteins might undergo a conformational change during adsorption of serum components onto nanoparticles , and thereby expose new binding motifs for specific receptors . For example , albumin is the major serum protein that upon adsorption to nanoparticles can undergo conformational changes and thereby be recognizable by SRs ( Yan and others 2013 ; Mortimer and others 2014 ; Fleischer and Payne 2014 ) . Moreover , considering that SRs may function as a signalosome complex with other receptors , it is possible that adsorbed proteins promote interactions with other possible receptors to promote interactions with cell surface and endocytosis of the nanoparticles . Indeed , cells plasma membrane contains a myriad of different receptors , e . g . folate and transferrin receptors , integrins and multiple of growth factor receptors , there - fore , it has been recently hypothesized that numerous epitopes on different protein corona proteins could target multiple receptors simultaneously ( Palchetti and others 2016 ) . Thus , it is highly essential to map the exact composition of the protein corona of nanoparticles to be able to predict their interactions with cells . 53 CONCLUSIONS Cell penetrating peptides hold great potential as vehicles for oligonucleotide delivery in the fields of biotechnology and biomedicine . However , their appli - cation is limited by incomplete understating of their action mechanisms , i . e . how CPP - ON nanoparticles internalize , where they are sorted in cells after the internalization , and whether and how efficiently they can promote endosomal escape in order to ensure the functionality of the payload . The main goal of the current research was to examine the cellular uptake mechanisms of one of the most effective delivery vectors for ONs , PepFect14 in complex with SCO , with special focus on the possible involvement of class A scavenger receptors . By using a combination of biochemical assays with confo - cal and transmission electron microscopy , we specifically aimed to delineate the role of cA - SRs in the cellular uptake of PF14 - SCO nanocomplexes , and to elu - cidate the endocytic pathways and intracellular destiny of the nanocomplexes after they bind to the receptors . The knowledge obtained from the current research expands the understanding of how CPPs function , as well as provides new insights into the action SR - A3 and SR - A5 , a field that is currently poorly explored . The main results of the current thesis are : ï· Negatively charged PF14 - SCO nanocomplexes are recognized and internalized by class A scavenger receptors SR - A3 and SR - A5 . ( Paper I and Paper II ) ï· SR - A3 and SR - A5 are not constantly present on the plasma membrane of HeLa pLuc705 cells , but are recruited there only after treatment with nanocomplexes . Moreover , in addition to nanocomplexes , PF14 itself can promote the cell surface mobilization of the receptors . Although at lower efficiency , similar phenomenon is also characteristic for other amphipathic CPPs , like TP10 , PF6 and CADY , and penetratin , and even for cationic R9 . ( Paper II and Paper IV ) ï· The cell surface recruitment of the receptors is highly regulated process that in addition to nanocomplexes is also dependent on intra - and extra - cellular calcium ions , PI3K activity , and actin cytoskeleton . ( Paper IV ) ï· The number of the receptors on the plasma membrane is also controlled by serum proteins . However , the number of the receptors is not directly correlated with the efficiency to induce the internalization and function - ality of PF14 - SCO complexes , since the uptake and splice - correction activity of the nanocomplexes in serum - containing and serum - free cul - ture media appeared to be rather equal . ( Paper IV ) ï· Association of PF14 - SCO nanocomplexes with SR - A3 and SR - A5 induces their internalization by cells mainly via macropinocytosis and caveolin - dependent endocytosis . ( Paper II ) ï· After internalization , PF14 - SCO nanocomplexes avoid targeting to low - acidic vesicles , but instead are rather located in non - or slightly acidic 54 vesicles . In contrary , the naked SCO is quickly targeted to lysosomes for degradation . ( Paper II ) ï· Only a small portion of PF14 - SCO nanocomplexes are able to escape from endosomes to the cytosol , indicating that the major limitation in cellular delivery of oligonucleotides by CPPs in the form of nanocom - plexes is their entrapment into endosomes . ( Paper II ) 55 SUMMARY IN ESTONIA PÃ¼Ã¼durretseptorid kui peptiididega nukleiinhapete rakku transportimise sihtmÃ¤rgid Oligonukleotiididel ( ON ) pÃµhinevad geeniregulatsiooni muutmise mehhanismid on pÃ¼Ã¼dnud Ã¼ha enam tÃ¤helepanu biotehnoloogias ja biomeditsiinis nii kaasa - sÃ¼ndinud kui omandatud haiguste raviks . Paraku suure molekulmassi ning nega - tiivse laengu tÃµttu ei ole sellised molekulid vÃµimelised iseseisvalt lÃ¤bima raku plasmamembraani . Kuna enamik ON sihtmÃ¤rkidest asuvad rakus sees tsÃ¼to - plasmas vÃµi raku tuumas , on vaja kasutada transportvektorit , mis Ã¼heltpoolt peab kaitsma ON lagundamise eest ning teisalt tagama selle jÃµudmise toime - kohani . Ãhed potentsiaalseimad transportvektorid on rakku sisenevad peptiidid ( RSP ) . RSPd on lÃ¼hikesed , kuni 40 aminohappe pikkused ning enamasti posi - tiivset laengut kandvad peptiidid , mis on vÃµimelised lÃ¤bima raku membraane ning rakkudesse suunama erineva suuruse ja omadusega bioaktiivseid molekule , kasutades selleks kovalentset vÃµi mitte - kovalentset strateegiat . Vaatamata sel - lele , et RSP - sid kui transportvektoreid on aktiivselt uuritud Ã¼le 20 aastat , on nende laiem rakendamine konkreetse ravimina piiratud peamiselt puudulike ning tihti vastukÃ¤ivate teadmistega nende toimimise mehhanismide kohta . Varem arvati , et RSPd moodustavad ON - ga positiivse laenguga komplekse , mis interakteerudes rakupinna negatiivselt laetud komponentidega indutseerivad rakkudesse sisenemise kasutades selleks peamiselt erinevaid endotsÃ¼tootilisi mehhanisme . Hiljuti aga tuvastati , et vastupidiselt eeldatule moodustuvad teise pÃµlvkonna RSP PepFect14 ( PF14 ) ja splaissingut korrigeeriva oligonukleotiidi ( SKO ) vahel hoopis negatiivse laenuga nanokompleksid ( Ezzat and others 2011 ) , mistÃµttu selliste komplekside seondumine rakkudega peaks olema vÃ¤he - efektiivne . Vaatamata sellele endotsÃ¼teeritake PF14 - SKO kompleksid rakkude poolt vÃ¤ga efektiivselt ning nad omavad kÃµrget bioloogilist aktiivsust . Praegu - seks on teada , et enamik RSP - ON komplekse omavad negatiivset laengut bio - loogilises keskkonnas ( van Asbeck and others 2013 ; Arukuusk and others 2013 ; Veiman and others 2013 ; Lindberg and others 2015 ) . Kuna otsene interaktsioon raku negatiivselt laetud struktuuridega on ebasoodne , vajavad sellised komp - leksid rakkudesse sisenemiseks tÃµenÃ¤oliselt retseptorit . Ãhed potentsiaalsed retseptori - kandidaadid on pÃ¼Ã¼durretseptorid ( i . k . scavenger receptors ) , mille omaduseks on siduda ja endotsÃ¼teerida negatiivse laenguga ligande . KÃ¤esolev uurimustÃ¶Ã¶ eesmÃ¤rgiks oli uurida pÃ¼Ã¼durretseptorite toimimismeh - hanisme PF14 ja SKO komplekside sisenemisel rakkudesse , sealhulgas kesken - dusime komplekside endotsÃ¼toosi mehhanismide selgitamisele ning nende raku - sisesele suunamisele ja paiknemisele . Samuti analÃ¼Ã¼sisime komplekside vÃµimet indutseerida endosoomidest vabanemist , mis on Ã¤Ã¤rmiselt oluline ON funktsio - naalsuse tagamiseks . Esimeses artiklis me tuvastasime , et PF14 - SKO kompleksid kasutavad rakkudesse sisenemiseks klass A pÃ¼Ã¼durretseptoreid SR - A3 ja SR - A5 . Rakkude tÃ¶Ã¶tlemine klass A pÃ¼Ã¼durretseptoreid inhibeerivate ligandide polÃ¼inosiinhappe , 56 dekstraan sulfaadi ja fukoidaaniga , vÃµi kasutades RNA interferentsi , et maha suruda SR - A3 ja SR - A5 ekspressioon , blokeeris nanopartiklite seondumise plasmamembraaniga , nende sisenemise rakkudesse ja SKO funktsionaalse aktiivsuse . Lisaks me kasutasime immunofluorestsents analÃ¼Ã¼si ning tuvasta - sime , et vastavad retseptorid kolokaliseeruvad kompleksidega nii rakkude pin - nal kui rakus sees vesiikulites , kinnitades et PF14 - SKO kompleksid sisenevad rakkudesse SR - A3 ja SR - A5 retseptorite vahendusel . Teises artiklis suunasime oma fookuse konkreetsete endotsÃ¼toosi mehhanis - mide ja rakusisese paiknemise selgitamiseks . Selleks , et uurida , milline endo - tsÃ¼toosirada indutseeritakse pÃ¤rast komplekside seondumist retseptoritele , me kasutasime farmakoloogilisi endotsÃ¼toosi inhibiitoreid : amiloriidi , nÃ¼statiini ja kloorpromasiini , mis inhibeerivad vastavalt makropinotsÃ¼toosi , kaveoliin - sÃµl - tuva endotsÃ¼toosi ning klatriin - sÃµltuva endotsÃ¼toosi rajad . Me tuvastasime , et interaktsioon rakupinna retseptoritega indutseerib PF14 - SKO komplekside sise - nemise rakkudesse peamiselt makropinotsÃ¼toosi ja kaveoliin - sÃµltuva endotsÃ¼ - toosi teel . Seevastu klatriin - sÃµltuva raja inhibeerimine komplekside vÃµimet indutseerida splaissingu korrektsiooni ei mÃµjutanud ning seega ei ole see rada oluline komplekside sisenemisel ja funktsionaalsuse avaldumisel . PÃ¤rast sisene - mist rakku , suunatakse endotsÃ¼teeritud materjal mÃ¶Ã¶da erinevaid radasid erine - vatesse rakusisestesse organellidesse , mis mÃ¤Ã¤ravad Ã¤ra endotsÃ¼teeritud mater - jali edasise saatuse . Rakkudele on iseloomulikud kaks peamist rada : esiteks ringlusrada , mille kaudu endotsÃ¼teeritud materjal suunatakse tagasi raku plasmamembraanile . Teiseks peamiseks rajaks on endo - lÃ¼sosomaalne rada , mÃ¶Ã¶da mida endotsÃ¼teeritav materjal suunatakse happelistesse lÃ¼sosoomidesse , kus toimub selle lÃµplik lagundamine . Rakusisene saatus vÃµib olla mÃ¤Ã¤ratud ka kindla endotsÃ¼toosiraja poolt . NÃ¤iteks on teada , et sisenemine rakkudesse lÃ¤bi kaveoliin - sÃµltuva raja vÃµib suunata endotsÃ¼teeritava materjali otse Golgi komp - leksi vÃµi endoplasmaatilisse retiikulumi ( ER ) . Antud komplekside rakusisese suunamise uurimine nÃ¤itas , et PF14 - SKO komplekse ei suunata trans - Golgi vÃµrgustiku sekretoorsetesse vesiikulitesse ning ei seega ei saadeta neid rakust vÃ¤lja . Samuti ei tÃ¤heldanud me komplekside paiknemist ERi . Me tuvastasime , et PF14 - SKO komplekse ei suunata ka klassikalisse endo - lÃ¼sosomaalsesse ratta , vaid enamik rakku sisenenud PF14 - SKO kompleksidest paiknesid pigem neut - raalse pH - ga vesiikulites ning ainult vÃ¤ike hulk PF14 - SKO komplekse suunati happelistesse lÃ¼sosoomidesse , isegi pÃ¤rast 4 - tunnist inkubatsiooni . Vastupidiselt kompleksidele , vaba SKO suunati juba 2 - tunni jooksul happelisesse vesiikuli - tesse , viidates sellele , et PF14 takistab endosoomide hapustumist ja kÃ¼psemist lÃ¼sosoomideks . Saadud tulemused on hÃ¤sti kooskÃµlas endotsÃ¼toosi inhibiitori - tega lÃ¤bi viidud katsetega , kuna arvatakse , et kaveoliin - sÃµltuv rada suunab endotsÃ¼teeritud materjali nÃµrgalt happelistesse vesiikulitesse , kust osaliselt indutseeritakse endosoomidest vabanemist ning paiknemist tsÃ¼toplasmasse . Siiski , valdav osa rakku sisenenud PF14 - SKO kompleksidest jÃ¤Ã¤b endosoomi - desse kinni ning vaid umbes 8 % nendest jÃµudis raku tsÃ¼toplasmasse , mis viitab sellele , et endosoomidesse kinnijÃ¤Ã¤mine on peamine limiteeriv faktor ON - de rakendamisel rakus toimuvate protsesside mÃµjutamiseks ja biomeditsiinis . 57 Esimeses artiklis me tuvastasime retseptorite ja komplekside koospaikne - mise rakkude pinnal ja sees fluorestsents mikroskoopia abil , kuid selleks et uurida nende interaktisoone detailsemalt , kaasasime ka elektronmikroskoopilise analÃ¼Ã¼si antud uurimustÃ¶Ã¶sse . MÃ¤rgistades kompleksid ja retseptorid erineva suurusega kullamÃ¤rgisega , me nÃ¤itasime , et kompleksid paiknevad retseptorite vahetus lÃ¤heduses , mistÃµttu vÃµib arvata , et nende interaktsioon on otsene . Seal - juures me tuvastasime , et efektiivseks sisenemiseks rakku on vajalik vaid vÃ¤heste retseptorite osalus . Ãllatavalt me tuvastasime , et antud retseptorid ei ole rakkude pinnale eksponeeritud pidevalt , vaid need suunatakse plasmamemb - raanile komplekside toimel nende lisamisel rakkude kasvulahusesse . Samas , vastavate retseptorite hulk raku tsÃ¼toplasmas oli mÃ¤rkimisvÃ¤Ã¤rne . TÃ¶Ã¶ kolmandas artiklis me keskendusime detailsemalt mehhanismidele , mis vÃµiksid osaleda retseptorite pinnale toomisel . Toetudes juba avaldatud tulemus - tele , keskendusime kaltsiumi ioonide ning fosfoinositool - 3 - kinaasi ( PI3K ) rol - lile selles protsessis . MÃµlemad eelnimetatud on vajalikud erinevate rakuliste protsesside reguleerimises , sealhulgas mitmete retseptorite regulatsioonis . Me tuvastasime , et nii rakuvÃ¤lise kui - sisese kaltsiumi eemaldamine vastavalt EGTA vÃµi BAPTA - AM - ga pÃ¤rsib retseptorite translokatsiooni rakkude pinnale , kus neid vÃµrreldes inhibeerimata kontroll - rakkudega oli oluliselt vÃ¤hem . Lisaks me tuvastasime , et nii rakuvÃ¤line kui - sisene kaltsium on olulised ka komp - lekside toime avaldumiseks , kuna kaltsiumi eemaldamine inhibeeris oluliselt SKO bioloogilist aktiivsust . Sarnased tulemused saime ka PI3K inhibeerimisel wortmannini vÃµi LY294002 - ga , mis vÃ¤hendasid oluliselt raku pinnale suunatud retseptorite hulka kui ka splaissingu korrektsiooni taset . Saadud tulemused nÃ¤itavad , et SR - A3 ja SR - A5 Ã¼mberpaiknemine raku tsÃ¼toplasmast rakkude pinnale on kÃµrgelt reguleeritud protsess , mis lisaks nanokompleksidele vajab ka kaltsiumioone ja PI3K aktiivsust . Erinevate nanopartiklite kasutamisel biomeditsiinis on hakatud Ã¼ha enam uurima ka nende interaktsioone bioloogilise keskkonnaga , mis vÃµib oluliselt mÃµjutada nanopartiklite eluiga ning jÃµudmist sihtmÃ¤rgini . SeetÃµttu me uurisime , kas retseptorite translokatsioon rakkude vÃ¤lismembraanile vÃµib sÃµltuda rakkude kasvulahuse koostisest , st . kas seerumiga ja seerumvabas sÃ¶Ã¶tmes on see prot - sess sarnane . Me tuvastasime , et seerumvabas sÃ¶Ã¶tmes suunatakse SR - A3 ja SR - A5 retseptoreid rakkude pinnale vÃ¤ga vÃ¤hesel mÃ¤Ã¤ral . Sellest jÃ¤reldub , et SR - A3 ja SR - A5 translokatsioonil rakkude pinnale on lisaks RSP - ON komp - leksidele ning kaltsiumioonidele ja PI3K aktiivsusele vajalikud ka rakusÃ¶Ã¶tmes oleva vereseerumi komponendid . Samas me leidsime , et retseptorite koguarv raku pinnal ei ole otseses seoses komplekside rakkudesse sisenemise ja splais - singu korrektsiooni efektiivsusega , kuna nii seerumvabas kui ka seerumit sisal - davas sÃ¶Ã¶tmes oli SKO indutseeritud splaissingu korrektsiooni tase Ã¼sna sarnane . TÃ¶Ã¶sse on kaasatud ka metodoloogiline artikkel oligonukleotiidide mÃ¤rgista - misest rakutranspordi uurimiseks ultrastruktuuri tasemel . 58 REFERENCES Abe N , Inoue T , Galvez T , Klein L , Meyer T . 2008 .
