A fundamental challenge in analyzing these data is the inference of protein machineries . Previous methods for detecting protein complexes have been mainly based on analyzing binary protein – protein interaction data , ignoring the more involved co - complex relations obtained from co - immunoprecipitation experiments . Results : Here , we devise a novel framework for protein complex detection from co - immunoprecipitation data . The framework aims at identifying sets of preys that signiﬁcantly co - associate with the same set of baits . In application to an array of datasets from yeast , our method identiﬁes thousands of protein complexes . Comparing these complexes to manually curated ones , we show that our method attains very high speciﬁcity and sensitivity levels ( ∼ 80 % ) , outperforming current approaches for protein complex inference .

The networks provide a step stone for ﬁnding protein complexes—the fundamental units of macromolecular organization ( Alberts , 1998 ) . The discovery of protein complexes based on yeast two hybrid data is a challenging task , since a protein complex may share common members with other complexes , and not all members of a certain protein complex directly interact with one another . CoIP data , however , can be used for ﬁnding complexes by itself since co - immunoprecipitation experiments directly test complex co - membership : a bait protein is tagged and a puriﬁcation of its complex co - members ( prey proteins ) is made followed by mass spectrometry . ∗ To whom correspondence should be addressed . Surprisingly , most methods for detecting protein complexes are based on treating protein interaction data as binary , i . e . interactions are between pairs of proteins only . This is commonly done by translating non - binary CoIP associations , of a bait to the set of preys obtained by tagging it , into binary interactions using the spoke model ( Bader and Hogue , 2002 ) , where a puriﬁcation is translated into a set of pairwise interactions between the bait and each of the precipitated preys . One of the most commonly used algorithms for this task is the Molecular Complex Detection ( MCODE ) algorithm by Bader and Hogue ( 2003 ) . MCODE detects densely connected components of the protein network . It is based on weighing vertices by the density of their local neighborhoods . Starting from a high weight vertex , a local expansion is done in a greedy fashion . Another common clustering algorithm is the Markov clustering algorithm ( MCL ) ( Enright et al . , 2002 ) . MCL simulates random walks on the protein interactions network . Random walks are performed iteratively ; after sufﬁciently many iterations , the probability that a walk that starts in a dense area of the graph will end in the same dense area is high . In order to magnify this effect , MCL applies , after each walk , an inﬂation step that separates high probability connections from low probability ones . Eventually , the process converges and a cluster structure of the graph is formed . MCL was shown to outperform other clustering algorithms for protein complex detection ( Brohee and van Helden , 2006 ) . Recently , Rungsarityotin et al . ( 2007 ) presented a new clustering method based on Markov random ﬁelds ( MRF ) . MRF applies a statistical model that assumes that the membership of each protein in a given cluster is only dependent on the membership status of its neighbors . Finally , Friedel et al . ( 2009 ) presented an unsupervised approach to ﬁnd protein complexes that uses a bootstrapping mechanism to derive reliability scores for interactions between proteins . The resulting weighted network is then clustered using MCL . The only unsupervised approach we are aware of that uses CoIP data directly is that of Scholtens et al . ( 2005 ) . This approach is called Local Modeling and is probabilistic in nature . It relies on building a directed network of bait – prey relationships and searching for subnetworks in which all protein pairs that were tested for a bait – prey relation are connected . Such ‘fully’connected subnetworks are shown to correspond well to protein complexes . Supervised methods for identifying protein complexes have also been developed . Gavin et al . ( 2006 ) deﬁned a ‘socio - afﬁnity’scoring system that measures the log ratio of the number of times two proteins are seen together in CoIP puriﬁcations , relative to what would be expected from their frequency in the dataset . These scores are used for clustering the proteins employing various © The Author ( s ) 2010 . Published by Oxford University Press .

Geva and R . Sharan clustering algorithms and parameters . Result sets that exhibit poor correspondence to manually curated complexes are discarded . Complex cores are identiﬁed as those stable parts of complexes that are not affected by the clustering algorithms / parameters . Collins et al . ( 2007 ) devised another scoring system for protein pairs , which combines the evidence in each puriﬁcation for bait – prey and prey – prey relationships . They applied hierarchical clustering to these scores to produce putative complexes . Pu et al . ( 2007 ) used the ( Collins et al . , 2007 ) scoring system together with the MCL algorithm to produce complex predictions . Another scoring system was used by Hart et al . ( 2007 ) in combination with the MCL algorithm to derive protein complexes . Another scoring scheme was developed by Zhang et al . ( 2008 ) , who used a maximum clique ﬁnding algorithm to derive complex predictions . In this article , we propose a novel method for inferring protein complexes from CoIP data , which we call CODEC ( COmplex DEtection from Coimmunoprecipitation data ) . We represent the data using a bipartite graph , where one set of vertices corresponds to the prey proteins , and the other one corresponds to the bait proteins . Edges connect a bait to its associated preys . Ideally , protein complexes should be manifested as fully connected bipartite subgraphs of this graph , as also argued in Scholtens et al . ( 2005 ) . In practice , experimental noise results in false positive and false negative associations in the CoIP data . In addition , for proteins that occur both as baits and preys in the data , we expect that if the bait ( prey ) instance is included in a complex , also its corresponding prey ( bait ) instance will be part of the complex . Thus , a complex is expected to appear as a dense bipartite subgraph such that every participating protein has both its bait and prey instances present . To identify those dense balanced bipartite subgraphs of the bait – prey graph , we adapted the SAMBA biclustering algorithm ( Tanay et al . , 2002 ) . We applied CODEC to three datasets from three large - scale experiments in yeast ( Gavin , 2002 ; Gavin et al . , 2006 ; Krogan et al . , 2006 ) , identifying thousands of protein complexes . We evaluated CODEC and compared it to extant approaches by using a collection of manually curated complexes from the MIPS ( Mewes , 2002 ) and GO ( Cherry et al . , 1998 ) databases . First , we compared CODEC to the three clustering approaches : MCODE , MCL and MRF . We show that CODEC outperforms these approaches on two large - scale datasets , attaining higher values of speciﬁcity and sensitivity . We did not include a comparison to the bootstrap method of Friedel et al . ( 2009 ) as the software was not readily available . Second , we show that CODEC can be useful even when supervised approaches are applicable , comparing it to two representative supervised approaches : those of Gavin et al . ( 2006 ) and Collins et al . ( 2007 ) . Remarkably , CODEC outperforms these approaches as well , even though they use curated information in the protein complex identiﬁcation process . Finally , we show that CODEC compares favorably to the Local Modeling approach ( Scholtens et al . , 2005 ) , and at the same time it is much more scalable , allowing the analysis of much larger datasets . 2 METHODS 2 . 1 Data acquisition We downloaded CoIP data for three datasets : ( i ) Gavin et al . ( 2006 ) , which contains 1993 bait proteins , 2670 prey proteins and 19277 bait – prey relationships ; ( ii ) Krogan et al . ( 2006 ) , which contains 2233 bait proteins , 5219 prey proteins [ 94 prey proteins were omitted from the raw data , since they were suspected as non - speciﬁc contaminants ( Krogan et al . , 2006 ) ] and 40623 bait – prey relations ; and ( iii ) Gavin ( 2002 ) , which contains 455 bait proteins , 1364 prey proteins and 3413 bait – prey relations . MIPS complexes were obtained from the MIPS database ( Mewes , 2002 ) ( February 2007 download ) . Only manually annotated complexes were used ( category 550 was excluded ) . From the 243 manually annotated MIPS complexes , we considered only complexes at level 3 or lower . Higher level complexes were collapsed to level 3 . Overall , the data contained 229 complexes . Gene ontology ( GO ) complexes were obtained from the Saccharomyces Genome Database ( Cherry et al . , 1998 ) ( March 2007 download ) . The GO dataset contained 193 complexes . 2 . 2 Graph construction and statistical data modeling We represent the CoIP data using a bipartite graph G = ( U , V , E ) , where vertices on one side ( U ) represent puriﬁcations with speciﬁc baits , and vertices on the other side ( V ) represent the union of the set of preys detected in all the puriﬁcations and the set of baits . For convenience , we name the vertices according to the proteins they represent . Edges connect baits to their associated preys . In addition , every puriﬁcation with a bait u is connected to u on the prey side . A candidate protein complex corresponds to a connected subgraph H (cid:3) = ( U (cid:3) , V (cid:3) , E (cid:3) ) of this graph , where V (cid:3) ⊆ V is the set of member proteins in the complex , and U (cid:3) ⊆ U is a set of puriﬁcations . We use a likelihood ratio score to evaluate a candidate protein complex . The score measures the ﬁt of a subgraph to a protein complex model versus the chance that the subgraph arises at random . The protein complex model assumes that each edge in the subgraph occurs with high probability p c , independently of all other vertex pairs . This assumption ignores possible dependencies between bait – prey associations , but allows computing candidate complex scores in an efﬁcient manner . The null model assumes that each edge ( u , v ) occurs with probability p u , v , independently of all other vertex pairs , where p u , v is the probability of observing an edge between u and v in a random bipartite graph with the same vertex degrees as G . In practice , we use p c = 0 . 9 as recommended in Tanay et al . ( 2002 ) . p u , v is approximated by d ( u ) d ( v ) | E | ( Itzkovitz etal . , 2003 ) , where d ( v ) denotesthedegreeofavertex v . Thus , the score of H (cid:3) is : L ( H (cid:3) ) = (cid:1) ( u , v ) ∈ E (cid:3) log p c p u , v + (cid:1) ( u , v ) (cid:6)∈ E (cid:3) log 1 − p c 1 − p u , v By setting the weight of each edge ( u , v ) to be log p c p u , v > 0 and the weight of each non - edge ( u , v ) to be log 1 − p c 1 − p u , v < 0 , we have that the score of a subgraph is the sum of weights of its vertex pairs . There are two exceptions to setting the edge weights : ( i ) an edge of the form ( v , v ) is assigned zero weight . ( ii ) We call a vertex whose corresponding protein serves as a bait in some puriﬁcation , but never detected as a prey , artiﬁcial . For such a vertex , we consider two weighting schemes . The ﬁrst , which we call w 0 , sets all weights involving artiﬁcial vertices to 0 , based on the assumption that these cases represent proteins that cannot be detected as preys due to experimental limitations . The second scheme , which we call w 1 , treats such vertices the same as all other vertices , resulting in all the weights involving artiﬁcial vertices being non - positive . 2 . 3 The algorithm Our algorithm for protein complex identiﬁcation employs a greedy search heuristic , which starts from high weight seeds and expands them using local search . We describe these phases below . 2 . 3 . 1 Seed deﬁnition . Recall that we seek heavy subgraphs of the bait – prey graph with the additional requirement that these subgraphs are consistent , namely that a bait instance of a protein is included if and only if the prey instance of the same protein is included . As seeds , we use complete bipartite subgraphs ( bicliques ) of the bait – prey graph , augmented by additional vertices so that the consistency requirement is satisﬁed .

Similarly , for a bait u ∈ U , denote its corresponding prey ( which might be artiﬁcial ) by m ( u ) . Then a prey subset S ⊆ V with a set of common ( bait ) neighbors N ( S ) induces the following consistent seed : C ( S ) = S ∪ N ( S ) ∪ { m ( v ) : v ∈ S ∪ N ( S ) } 2 . 3 . 2 Seed identiﬁcation . We start by identifying a high weight seed aroundeachprotein . Toﬁndconsistentseeds , weadaptthealgorithminTanay et al . ( 2002 ) . Basically , as shown in Tanay et al . ( 2002 ) , the heaviest biclique in a bipartite graph can be identiﬁed by an iterative algorithm . At each iteration , theneighborhoodofavertex u ∈ U isscanned , andeachsubsetofits neighbors is credited by the weight from u to the vertices of this subset . After scanning all vertices in U , the subset that attained the highest weight induces the heaviest biclique . In our case , we have a further consistency requirement . Hence , wehavetoaugmenteachofthepossibleseedsbyappropriatevertices . To this end , we add a post - processing step to the algorithm above which updatestheweightofeverysubsetaccordingtotheconsistentseeditinduces . For computational efﬁciency , we limit the size of the scanned subsets to 2 – 4 . We only scan subsets that contain the prey vertex that corresponds to u . Each candidate seed is scored by its log - likelihood ratio . We retain the 500000 highest scoring candidates and store them in a heap to prevent duplicates . 2 . 3 . 3 Greedy expansion . This phase iteratively applies modiﬁcations to the seed so as to expand it and increase its weight . Seeds are sorted by their log likelihood in a descending order . The greedy expansion is applied to the seeds by that order . At each iteration , all possible vertex additions to the seed and vertex deletions from the seed are considered , where baits are coupled to their corresponding preys to maintain consistency under these modiﬁcations . The modiﬁcation that improves the score the most is accepted . This process continues until the score of the subgraph cannot be further improved . For efﬁciency reasons , this phase is applied only to seeds that were not contained in previous expanded subgraphs . 2 . 3 . 4 Filtering the results . We focus on clusters with at least three preys . We evaluate the signiﬁcance of a cluster by comparing the score of its corresponding subgraph to those obtained on randomized instances . Speciﬁcally , we create random graphs with the same vertex degrees as G by using the Maslov – Sneppen procedure ( Maslov and Sneppen , 2002 ) . The procedure switches a pair of edges ( u , v ) and ( u (cid:3) , v (cid:3) ) with ( u , v (cid:3) ) and ( u (cid:3) , v ) , provided that the latter did not exist in the ﬁrst place . The switches are done 100 m times , where m is the number of edges in the original graph ( Milo et al . , 2003 ) . Our algorithm is applied to these randomized instances to compute a null distribution of subgraph scores . We use this distribution to compute a P - value for each of the clusters and retain only clusters whose P - value is smaller than a threshold . To avoid redundant solutions , we ﬁlter putative protein complexes with high similarity to one another . The similarity is measured based on the intersection of the prey sets of the compared clusters . Speciﬁcally , for two putative complexes V 1 and V 2 we measure their similarity as | V 1 ∩ V 2 | / min { | V 1 | , | V 2 | } . If the similarity exceeds a predeﬁned threshold , then the subgraph with the higher P - value is discarded . We used 80 % as the similarity ﬁltering threshold [ as in ( Sharan et al . , 2005 ) ] ; a lower value of 50 % yielded a similar performance ( see Supplementary Table S2 ) . 2 . 3 . 5 Implementation and running time We implemented CODEC using themicrosoft . netframework2 . 0andtheC # programminglanguage . CODEC was applied to three datasets , as detailed above , on a Intel core 2 duo 1 . 86GHz processor with 1GB memory . The running time ranged from minutes to hours , depending on the size of the dataset . The running time of CODEC on the smallest ( Gavin , 2002 ) dataset was 5min ; the application to the medium ( Gavin et al . , 2006 ) dataset took 3h ; ﬁnally , the run on the largest ( Krogan et al . , 2006 ) dataset lasted 30h . 2 . 4 Quality assessment We assess the quality of the produced complexes by measuring their speciﬁcity and sensitivity with respect to a set of gold standard ( known ) complexes . Tothisend , foreachoutputclusterweﬁndaknowncomplexwith which its intersection is the most signiﬁcant according to a hypergeometric score . The hypergeometric score is compared with those obtained for 10000 random sets of proteins of the same size , and an empirical P - value is derived . These P - values are further corrected for multiple hypothesis testing using the false discovery rate procedure ( Benjamini and Hochberg , 1995 ) . We say that a cluster is a signiﬁcant match to a complex if it has a corrected P - value lower than 0 . 05 . Let C be the group of clusters from the examined result set , excluding clusters that do not overlap any of the true complexes . Let C ∗ ⊆ C be the subset of clusters that signiﬁcantly overlap a known complex . The speciﬁcity of the result set is deﬁned as | C ∗ | / | C | . Let T be the set of true complexes , excluding complexes whose overlap with the examined dataset is less than 3 proteins and ensuring a maximum inter - complex overlap of 80 % . Let T ∗ ⊆ T be the subset of true complexes with a signiﬁcant match by a cluster . The sensitivity of the result set is deﬁned as | T ∗ | / | T | . The F - measure is a measure combining the speciﬁcity and sensitivity measures . It is deﬁned as the harmonic average of these two measures : 2 ∗ speciﬁcity ∗ sensitivity speciﬁcity + sensitivity In addition , we also used the Accuracy measure suggested by Brohee and van Helden ( 2006 ) . This measure also evaluates the quality of complex predictionsagainstagoldstandardset . Theaccuracymeasureisthegeometric mean of two other measures : positive predictive value ( PPV ) and sensitivity . PPV measures how well a given cluster predicts its best matching complex . Let T i , j be the size of the intersection between the i - th annotated complex and the j - th complex prediction . Denote PPV i , j = T i , j (cid:2) ni = 1 T i , j = T i , j T j where n is the number of annotated complexes , and T j is the sum of the sizes of all of cluster j intersection sizes . The PPV of a single cluster j is deﬁned as PPV j = n max i = 1 PPV i , j The general PPV of the complex prediction set is deﬁned by PPV = (cid:2) mj = 1 T j PPV j (cid:2) mj = 1 T j where m is the number of complex predictions . The sensitivity measure used by Brohee et al . ( which is different from the one deﬁned above ) represents the coverage of a complex by its best - matching cluster . Denote Sn i , j = T i , j N i where N i is the number of proteins in the annotated complex i . Complex - wise sensitivity is deﬁned as Sn i = m max j = 1 Sn i , j The sensitivity of a complex set is deﬁned as Sn = (cid:2) ni = 1 N i Sn i (cid:2) ni = 1 N i The Accuracy measure can be inﬂuenced by small and insigniﬁcant intersections of a predicted complex and an annotated one . For example , if a predicted complex intersects only one annotated complex , and the size of the intersection is 1 , the PPV of that predicted complex will be 1 . 0 . Thus , we used a threshold to limit the effect of such small intersections , and evaluated the different solutions under varying thresholds ranging from 0 to 10 . For each such threshold t , all intersections of size at most t were not included in the Accuracy computation . 113 D o w n l oaded f r o m h tt p s : / / a c ade m i c . oup . c o m / b i o i n f o r m a t i cs / a r t i c l e - ab s t r a c t / 27 / 1 / 111 / 202509 b y gue s t on 21 J anua r y 2019 [ 16 : 42 16 / 12 / 2010 Bioinformatics - btq652 . tex ] Page : 114 111 – 117 G . Geva and R . Sharan 2 . 5 Parameter tuning The input for the MCL and MCODE clustering algorithms was the set of interactions resulting from connecting a bait protein to its preys [ the spoke model ( Bader and Hogue , 2002 ) ] for each of the datasets . For setting the parameters of the algorithms , we used the values recommended by Brohee and van Helden ( 2006 ) . Speciﬁcally , we used the inﬂation parameter 1 . 8 for MCL . For MCODE , we used the parameters depth = 100 , node score percentage = 0 , Haircut = TRUE , Fluff = FALSE and percentage for complex ﬂufﬁng = 0 . 2 . MRF was applied using the spoke model , using the parameters suggested by Rungsarityotin et al . ( 2007 ) , i . e . K = 698 and ψ = 3 . 5 . We obtained the Local Modeling implementation from the bioconductor http : / / www . bioconductor . org . The parameters used to run Local Modeling are the default parameters mentioned in Scholtens et al . ( 2005 ) . When creating complex estimates from Collins et al . ( 2007 ) , we used MCL with the same parameters as described above , and used the PE values as the input to the MCL algorithm . 3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 3 . 1 CODEC overview CODEC is based on reformulating the protein complex identiﬁcation problem as that of ﬁnding signiﬁcantly dense subgraphs in a bipartite graph . We construct a bipartite graph whose vertices on one side represent prey proteins , and vertices on the other side represent bait proteins . Edges connect a bait protein to its associated preys . Ideally , a complex should appear as a fully connected bipartite subgraph ( biclique ) in this graph . In practice , due to experimental noise , a complex will appear as a dense bipartite subgraph . We note that further experimentation using methods such as cross - linking and sequential CoIP can improve the detection process , but is far more costly . In addition , we impose a consistency requirement : some proteins occur in the data both as baits and as preys . For such proteins , we require that if a certain prey ( bait ) vertex is included in the subgraph , so must be the corresponding bait ( prey ) . These deﬁnitions areexempliﬁedinFigure1 . Theexampledatasetcontains10proteins marked as P1 - P10 ( Fig . 1a ) . Four puriﬁcations are made . The proteins used as baits are P3 , P4 , P5 and P7 . There are two sets of preys that are supported by more than one bait : { P2 , P3 , P4 , P5 } and { P5 , P6 , P7 , P8 } . It can be hypothesized that these sets correspond to two protein complexes , shown in Figure 1b . In both cases , the consistency requirement is satisﬁed . The missing edge between P5 and P2 is a likely false negative , since both P3 and P4 interact with P2 . There may be additional complexes in this toy example , but there is only weak evidence for their existence since they are detected as preys by a single bait protein . We adapted the SAMBA algorithm ( Tanay et al . , 2002 ) to ﬁnd putative complexes , henceforth called clusters . As further detailed in the Methods , the algorithm relies on a scoring component and a search heuristic to identify high scoring subgraphs . The scoring of a subgraph is based on a likelihood ratio score , which measures the density of the subgraph versus the chance that its connections arise at random . We experimented with two scoring variants : a permissive one , w 0 , and a stricter one , w 1 ( see Section 2 ) . In all the applications below , we report on the results of both variants . The search heuristic starts from small bicliques and expands them using greedy search . Unlike SAMBA , the search procedure also ensures that the consistency requirement is met by coupling together the prey and bait instances of a protein . Fig . 1 . An example data set . ( a ) An input bait – prey graph . Baits are colored in blue and preys are colored in red . ( b ) Two possible protein complexes and their corresponding subgraphs . The signiﬁcance of the identiﬁed clusters is evaluated by comparing their scores to those obtained on randomized instances , where the edges of the bipartite graph are shufﬂed while maintaining node degrees . We retain only signiﬁcant clusters and further eliminate redundant clusters with high overlap among them . 3 . 2 Application and evaluation As a ﬁrst test of CODEC , we applied it to two recently published large - scale CoIP datasets in yeast . The ﬁrst dataset from Gavin et al . ( 2006 ) contains 1993 bait proteins and 2670 prey proteins , and its edge density in the bipartite graph model is 0 . 006 . The second dataset from Krogan et al . ( 2006 ) contains 2233 bait proteins and 5219 prey proteins , and its edge density in the bipartite graph model is 0 . 003 . This dataset has a much lower bait to prey ratio than the former one and , thus , serves as a different test case for our method . CODEC was applied to the two original datasets ; no proteins were ﬁltered . The application of CODEC to the ﬁrst dataset using the w 0 weighting scheme yielded clusters with 12 baits and 22 preys on average The average edge density within an output cluster was very high ( 0 . 65 ) . When using the stricter w 1 scheme , a similar number of clusters was obtained , but the clusters were much smaller ( 4 . 5 baits and 13 . 5 preys on average ) . The application of CODEC to the second dataset using the w 0 weighing scheme produced clusters with 4 baits and 16 preys on average . The average interaction density within the output clusters was high ( 0 . 54 ) . When using the w 1 scheme , the number of clusters dropped by 3 - fold although their sizes remained similar to the w 0 case . The size distributions of the obtained protein clusters in each of two applications are provided in Supplementary Table S1 . To assess the quality of our results , we measured their speciﬁcity and sensitivity with respect to a collection of manually curated complexes taken from the MIPS ( Mewes , 2002 ) database ( see Section 2 ) . Speciﬁcity is deﬁned as the fraction of clusters that signiﬁcantly overlap a known complex ; sensitivity is deﬁned as the fraction of known complexes that signiﬁcantly overlap an identiﬁed cluster . We computed receiver operating characteristic ( ROC ) curves for the two datasets , which plot the sensitivity and ( 1 − speciﬁcity ) values over a range of P - value cutoffs for the output clusters ( Figures 2 and 3 ) . In each plot , we chose the point that maximizes 114 D o w n l oaded f r o m h tt p s : / / a c ade m i c . oup . c o m / b i o i n f o r m a t i cs / a r t i c l e - ab s t r a c t / 27 / 1 / 111 / 202509 b y gue s t on 21 J anua r y 2019 [ 16 : 42 16 / 12 / 2010 Bioinformatics - btq652 . tex ] Page : 115 111 – 117 Identiﬁcation of protein complexes Fig . 2 .

See legend of Figure 2 for details . the sum of sensitivity and speciﬁcity ( Cofﬁn and Sukhatme , 1997 ) as the P - value cutoff for the output clusters . The results attained are summarized in Table 1 . We compared CODEC to three clustering algorithms : MCODE , MCL and MRF ( Table 1 and Figures 2 and 3 ) . On both datasets , CODEC outperformed MCODE and MCL , yielding signiﬁcantly higher sensitivity values . The cluster set provided by Rungsarityotin et al . ( 2007 ) was computed by applying MRF using the spoke model to the Gavin et al . ( 2006 ) dataset ( the MRF results with the matrix model were inferior and , hence , were not used in the comparison ) . CODEC and MRF achieved similar sensitivity scores , but at the same time CODEC attained signiﬁcantly higher speciﬁcity . Qualitatively similar results were obtained when evaluating the collections of protein complexes based on known complexes from the GO ( Cherry et al . , 1998 ) database ( see Supplementary Figures S1 and S2 ) . When using an alternative evaluation measure— the Accuracy measure suggested by Brohee and van Helden ( 2006 ) —CODEC was again shown to outperform MCL and MCODE , while providing results that were only slightly better than those of MRF ( see Supplementary Figures S3 and S4 ) . Notably , all the tested methods perform worse on the data of Krogan et al . because of its low bait to prey ratio . 3 . 3 Comparison to extant CoIP - based approaches The results above demonstrate the utility of using CoIP data for protein complex identiﬁcation . Next , we compared CODEC to extant protein complex inference methods that use such data . As a ﬁrst test , we compared CODEC to two other methods that use CoIP data for scoring pairs of putatively interacting proteins . The ﬁrst ( Gavin et al . , 2006 ) computes cores of complexes based on ‘socio - afﬁnity’scoring system that measures the log ratio of the number of times two proteins are seen together in CoIP puriﬁcations , relative to what would be expected from their frequency in the dataset . The second ( Collins et al . , 2007 ) scores pairs of proteins using a puriﬁcation enrichment ( PE ) score , which combines the evidence in each puriﬁcation for bait – prey and prey – prey relationships . We used these PE scores as input to the MCL algorithm [ as suggested in Brohee and van Helden ( 2006 ) ] . Importantly , both methods use manually curated information ( known protein complexes from MIPS ) to tune their parameters . We conducted the comparison on the the Gavin et al . ( 2006 ) dataset , for which we had the complex cores from Gavin et al . ( 2006 ) . The results are summarized in Table 2 and depicted in Figure 2 . Notably , even though the methods of Gavin et al . ( 2006 ) and Collins et al . ( 2007 ) use prior biological information in the inference process , CODEC outperforms both , attaining higher sensitivity and speciﬁcity values . The most pronounced difference is with respect to the speciﬁcity of Gavin’s cores ( 78 % versus 51 % ) . Our ﬁnal comparison was to the Local Modeling method ( Scholtens et al . , 2005 ) . The available implementation of the method could not run on the datasets of Gavin et al . ( 2006 ) and Krogan et al . ( 2006 ) due to their relatively large size . Hence , we used a smaller data set as a test case ( Gavin , 2002 ) , containing 455 bait proteins and 1364 prey proteins . The protein complexes inferred by Local Modeling are partitioned into three categories : complexes that are supported by multiple baits ( marked as MBME ) , complexes that are supported by a single bait ( marked as SMBH ) and complexes that contain two baits where only one of the baits identiﬁes the other bait as its prey . We focused on the 272 MBME complexes , which represent the highest conﬁdence predictions . As can be seen in Table 3 and Figure 4 , CODEC outperforms local modeling , attaining higher speciﬁcity and sensitivity . When including in the Local Modeling solution also the SMBH complexes ( 336 in total ) the sensitivity increased to 93 % , at the price of a decrease in speciﬁcity 115 D o w n l oaded f r o m h tt p s : / / a c ade m i c . oup . c o m / b i o i n f o r m a t i cs / a r t i c l e - ab s t r a c t / 27 / 1 / 111 / 202509 b y gue s t on 21 J anua r y 2019 [ 16 : 42 16 / 12 / 2010 Bioinformatics - btq652 . tex ] Page : 116 111 – 117 G .

Overall , these results are comparable to those of CODEC , although providing a slightly worse F - measure ( 79 % compared with CODEC’s 82 . 5 % ) . 4 CONCLUSION We have provided a novel algorithm for identifying protein complexes from co - immunoprecipitation data , which is based on reformulating the problem as that of ﬁnding heavy subgraphs in a bipartite graph . We have shown that our approach , which uses non - binary co - complex information , is superior to clustering methods that dissect binary protein – protein interaction data . Our algorithm was also shown to outperform existing approaches for inferring protein complexes from CoIP data . All complex predictions made by CODEC can be found at http : / / www . cs . tau . ac . il / ∼ roded / CODEC / main . html . An interesting open challenge is to combine yeast two - hybrid data into the inference process . Such a combined approach is expected to become increasingly important as protein – protein interaction databases continue to grow in size and species coverage . Fig . 4 .
