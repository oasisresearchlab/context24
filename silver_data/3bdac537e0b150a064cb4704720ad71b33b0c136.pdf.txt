Although stem cells from embryonic and extraembryonic origins have been generated for 30 several mammalian species ( Bogliotti et al . , 2018 ; Choi et al . , 2019 ; Cui et al . , 2019 ; Evans and 31 Kaufman , 1981 ; Kunath et al . , 2005 ; Li et al . , 2008 ; Martin , 1981 ; Okae et al . , 2018 ; Tanaka et 32 al . , 1998 ; Thomson et al . , 1998 ; Vandevoort et al . , 2007 ; Vilarino et al . , 2020 ; Yu et al . , 2021b ; 33 Zhong et al . , 2018 ) , they are grown in different culture conditions with diverse media 34 composition , which makes it difficult to study cross - lineage communication . Here , by using the 35 same culture condition that activates FGF , TGF - β and WNT signaling pathways , we derived 36 stable embryonic stem cells ( ESCs ) , extraembryonic endoderm stem cells ( XENs ) and 37 trophoblast stem cells ( TSCs ) from all three founding tissues of mouse and cynomolgus monkey 38 blastocysts . This allowed us to establish embryonic and extraembryonic stem cell co - cultures to 39 dissect lineage crosstalk during early mammalian development . Co - cultures of ESCs and XENs 40 uncovered a conserved and previously unrecognized growth inhibition of pluripotent cells by 41 extraembryonic endoderm cells , which is in part mediated through extracellular matrix signaling . 42 Our study unveils a more universal state of stem cell self - renewal stabilized by activation , as 43 opposed to inhibition , of developmental signaling pathways . The embryonic and extraembryonic 44 stem cell co - culture strategy developed here will open new avenues for creating more faithful 45 embryo models and developing more developmentally relevant differentiation protocols . 46 INTRODUCTION 47 In mammals , embryogenesis is accompanied by the establishment and loss of pluripotency , a 48 transient property enabling embryonic epiblast cells to generate all cells in an adult organism . 49 Pluripotent epiblast cells can be propogated in vitro in a spectrum of pluripotent stem cell ( PSC ) 50 states with different culture conditions ( Pera and Rossant , 2021 ; Wu and Izpisua Belmonte , 51 2015 ) . PSCs with unique molecular and functional features provide us with invaluable in vitro 52 models to study early mammalian development with great potential for regenerative medicine . 53 Despite the potential , however , PSCs exist in the artificial milieu of cell culture , which is vastly 54 different from the in vivo environment . One notable difference is the lack of communication with 55 extraembryonic cells in cultured PSCs . Extraembryonic tissues play crucial roles in embryo 56 3 patterning and size control during early embryogenesis ( Rivera - Pérez and Hadjantonakis , 2015 ; 57 Shahbazi and Zernicka - Goetz , 2018 ) . Consequently , PSC - only models suffer from several 58 culture artifacts that potentially limit their potential , e . g . , unsynchronized and disorganized 59 differentiation , and unfettered growth . 60 To overcome these limitations , for the first time , we succeeded in the derivation of stem cells 61 from embryonic and extraembryonic tissues using the same condition from both mouse and 62 cynomolgus monkey blastocysts . This enabled the culture of embryonic and extraembryonic 63 stem cells in the same environment , and thereby opening the door for dissecting their direct 64 communication . 65 RESULTS 66 A common culture for all blastocyst lineages 67 We previously reported de novo derivation of intermediate embryonic stem cells ( ESCs ) from 68 mouse blastocysts by activating FGF , TGF - β and WNT pathways ( FTW - mESCs ) ( Yu et al . , 69 2021b ) . To enrich the FTW - mESC population , a MEK inhibitor ( PD0325901 ) was added to 70 suppress the proliferation of extra - embryonic cells ( Yu et al . , 2021b ) . Withdrawal of PD0325901 71 during FTW - mESCs derivation resulted in the co - appearance of epiblast - like cells ( ELCs ) , 72 trophoblast - like cells ( TLCs ) , and extraembryonic endoderm - like cells ( XLCs ) in the blastocyst 73 outgrowth ( Figure S1A ) . After manual picking , separate cultivation , and further passaging in the 74 FTW condition , stable extraembryonic endoderm stem cells ( designated as FTW - mXENs ) , 75 trophoblast stem cells ( designated as FTW - mTSCs ) , and FTW - mESCs could be derived from a 76 single mouse blastocyst ( Figure 1A and 1B ) . FTW - mXENs , FTW - mTSCs and FTW - mESCs 77 expressed extraembryonic endoderm , trophoblast , and epiblast markers , respectively ( Figure 1C 78 and Figure S1B to S1E ) . Next , we compared FTW - mXENs and FTW - mTSCs with mXENs and 79 mTSCs in conventional conditions ( Chiu et al . , 2010 ; Niakan et al . , 2013 ) ( Figure S1F to S1I ) . 80 FTW - mTSCs and FTW - mXENs expressed their respective lineage markers at comparable levels 81 to mTSCs and mXENs , respectively ( Figure S1J ) . Although similar proliferation rates were 82 observed for mTSCs and FTW - mTSCs , FTW - mXENs exhibited a significantly shorter doubling 83 time than mXENs ( Figure S1K ) . After random differentiation of FTW - mXENs in vitro , several 84 parietal endoderm ( PE ) and visceral endoderm ( VE ) related genes were upregulated ( Artus et al . , 85 2012 ) ( Figure S1L ) . Following subcutaneous injection into an immunodeficient NOD - SCID 86 4 mouse , FTW - mXENs formed a teratoma - like tissue mass ( designated as XEN - teratoma ) after 3 87 months ( Figure S1M ) . Immunofluorescence ( IF ) analysis revealed that within the XEN - teratoma 88 many cells expressed alpha - fetoprotein ( AFP ) ( Kwon et al . , 2006 ) , some cells were GATA6 + , 89 and others stained positive for yolk sac markers FOXA1 and / or COL6A1 ( Figure S1N and S1O ) . 90 We did not detect T + ( mesoderm ) or PAX6 + ( ectoderm ) cells in the XEN - teratoma ( Figure 91 S1M ) . For FTW - mTSCs , after random differentiation in vitro , multinucleated cells appeared 92 ( Figure S1P ) and genes related to trophoblast differentiation were upregulated ( Cui et al . , 2019 ) 93 ( Figure S1R ) . FTW - mTSCs also formed a tissue mass ( TSC - teratoma ) containing multinucleated 94 trophoblast giant - cell like cells two weeks after injection into a NOD - SCID mouse ( Figure S1Q ) . 95 Next , we performed blastocyst injections and found that GFP ( green fluorescent protein ) or mKO 96 ( monomeric Kusabira - Orange ) labeled FTW - mXENs and FTW - mTSCs contributed to chimera 97 formation in the yolk sac and placenta tissues of mouse conceptuses ( E7 . 5 and E11 . 5 ) , 98 respectively ( Figure 1D to 1G , Figure S1S and Table S1 ) . 99 In sum , we discovered a common culture condition could support de novo derivation and long - 100 term culture of embryonic and extraembryonic stem cells from mouse blastocysts . 101 Transcriptome profiling 102 We next performed bulk RNA - sequencing ( RNA - seq ) to examine the global transcriptional 103 profiles of FTW stem cells and compared them with published datasets from established mouse 104 embryonic and extraembryonic stem cells ( Anderson et al . , 2017 ; Bao et al . , 2018 ; Cruz - Molina 105 et al . , 2017 ; Cui et al . , 2019 ; Kubaczka et al . , 2015 ; Wu et al . , 2015 ; Wu et al . , 2011 ; Ye et al . , 106 2018 ; Zhao et al . , 2015 ; Zhong et al . , 2018 ) . We found that FTW - mXENs , FTW - mTSCs and 107 FTW - mESCs expressed their respective lineage markers and clustered together with stem cells 108 derived from the same tissue of origin ( Figure 2A and Figure S2A , S2B ) . Based on comparison 109 with in vivo datasets , we found FTW - mESCs , FTW - mTSCs and FTW - mXENs were 110 transcriptionally most closely related to E5 . 5 epiblast ( EPI ) , E5 . 25 - E5 . 5 extraembryonic 111 ectoderm ( ExE ) ( Cheng et al . , 2019 ) and E5 . 5 VE ( Mohammed et al . , 2017 ) , respectively ( Figure 112 S2C and S2D ) . To resolve the transcriptional states of FTW stem cells , we performed single - cell 113 RNA - sequencing ( scRNA - seq ) and compared with published single - cell transcriptomes derived 114 from E3 . 5 - E6 . 5 mouse embryos ( Nowotschin et al . , 2019 ) . Consistent with bulk RNA - seq results , 115 we found that FTW - mESCs , FTW - mTSCs and FTW - mXENs showed the highest correlation 116 5 with E5 . 5 EPI , E5 . 5 TE ( trophectoderm ) and E5 . 5 PrE ( primitive endoderm ) , respectively 117 ( Figure 2B ) . Uniform manifold approximation and projection ( UMAP ) analysis further revealed 118 FTW stem cells clustered closely with cells from their respective lineages in E5 . 5 mouse 119 conceptuses ( Figure S2E ) . To examine the temporal steps of FTW stem cells derivation , in 120 addition to established FTW stem cell lines ( passage 10 ) , we performed scRNA - seq of 121 blastocysts ( day 0 ) and blastocyst outgrowths ( day 8 ) . Our analysis revealed clear segregation of 122 ELCs , TLCs and ELCs in blastocyst outgrowths ( Figure 2C ) . Slingshot ( Street et al . , 2018 ) 123 pseudotime analysis was performed to delineate differentiation trajectories during derivation . 124 Interestingly , in blastocyst outgrowths , ELCs have already acquired similar transcriptional states 125 of stable FTW - mESCs while TLCs and ELCs clustered separately from established FTW - 126 mTSCs and FTW - mXENs , respectively ( Figure 2C ) . Next , we identified stage specific genes and 127 enriched Gene Ontology ( GO ) terms . Notably , several common stage - specific features across all 128 lineages emerged in our analysis , e . g . blastocysts were enriched with terms related to 129 modification of DNA , RNA and / or protein , suggesting active gene transcription and translation , 130 and dynamic signaling activities in these cells ; cells in blastocyst outgrowths shared terms 131 related to actin dynamics , which implicates active cell movement and dynamic changes in cell 132 shape ; established FTW stem cells , on the other hand , are characterized by terms related to 133 glycolysis and hypoxia , which is indicative of their stabilization in the FTW condition ( Figure 134 2D to 2F ) . 135 Taken together , these transcriptomic analyses confirmed lineage identities , revealed temporal 136 properties and derivation dynamics of FTW - mESCs , FTW - mTSCs and FTW - mXENs . 137 Cross - lineage stem cell co - cultures 138 Having FTW - mESCs , FTW - mXENs and FTW - mTSCs derived and maintained in the same 139 condition enabled us to establish co - cultures to study intercellular communications between 140 embryonic and extraembryonic lineages ( Figure 3A ) . To this end , we labeled FTW - mESCs with 141 GFP and subjected them to co - culture with mKO - labeled FTW - mXENs , in the presence or 142 absence of FTW - mTSCs ( unlabeled ) . Interestingly , after 5 days of co - culture in the FTW 143 condition , many FTW - mESC colonies were surrounded by FTW - mXENs . These FTW - mESC 144 colonies appeared smaller and more “domed” when compared to standalone colonies ( not in 145 contact with FTW - mXENs ) and FTW - mESC colonies from separate culture ( Figure 3B and 146 6 Video S1 ) . Of note is that we didn’t observe this phenomenon in FTW - mESCs co - cultured with 147 either FTW - mTSCs or mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( Figure 3B ) . In consistent , we found a 148 significant reduction of the GFP signal " Area x Intensity / Colony” in FTW - mESCs co - cultured 149 with FTW - mXENs and FTW - mXENs / FTW - mTSCs ( Figure 3C ) but not with FTW - mTSCs and 150 fibroblasts , when compared with separately cultured FTW - mESCs . We also calculated the cell 151 density ( cell number per cm 2 ) of FTW - mESCs daily in each experimental group . On day 5 , a 152 significantly lower density of FTW - mESCs was found in FTW - ESCs / TSCs / XENs and FTW - 153 ESCs / XENs groups than in control groups ( Figure 3D and Figure S3A ) . We tested the effects of 154 different cell plating ratios and found greater reduction in FTW - mESC densities when co - 155 cultured with more FTW - mXENs in both 2D and 3D ( Figure S3B to S3D ) . This decrease in 156 FTW - mESC density in co - culture was not due to increased cell apoptosis ( Figure S3E and S3F ) 157 or differentiation ( Figure S3G ) and was dependent on direct contact with FTW - mXENs ( Figure 158 S3H , S3I and Video S1 ) . 159 Next , we studied whether this growth inhibition phenotype manifested during differentiation . We 160 injected the same number of FTW - mESCs either alone or together with FTW - mXENs under the 161 skin of NOD - SCID mice ( Figure 3E ) . Although in both conditions teratomas that contained 162 tissues from all three germ lineages could be generated ( Figure S3J ) , the average size and weight 163 of teratomas generated by co - injection were smaller than FTW - mESCs alone ( Figure 3F to 3H ) . 164 We also tested different ESC : XEN ratios and found in general the more FTW - mXENs were 165 injected , the smaller the teratomas ( Figure S3K ) . To study whether this growth restriction also 166 exists between EPI and VE cells , we isolated E6 . 5 - 6 . 75 mouse conceptuses , removed ExE and 167 ectoplacental cone , and used EPI with or without VE ( VE + / - ) for ex vivo culture ( Figure 3I ) . 168 Interestingly , the size and total cell number in the VE + group were significantly smaller than 169 those in the VE - group ( Figure 3J , 3K and Figure S3L ) , suggesting the proliferation of EPI is 170 also limited by the VE . 171 Collectively , we established embryonic and extra - embryonic stem cell co - cultures and identified 172 a contact - dependent growth restriction of FTW - mESCs by FTW - mXENs , which may reflect an 173 embryo size control mechanism during early development . 174 Mechanistic insights 175 7 To gain mechanistic insights into the crosstalk among co - cultured FTW stem cells , we performed 176 scRNA - seq analysis ( Figure 4A ) . UMAP analysis showed that cells in co - cultures largely 177 overlapped with separately cultured cells ( Figure S4A and S4B ) . We used the CellChat ( Jin et al . , 178 2021 ) toolkit to infer cell - cell communication . As expected , both the number and strength of 179 cell - cell interactions increased in co - cultures when compared to separate cultures ( Figure 4B ) . 180 Interestingly , a significant proportion of these interactions originated from FTW - mXENs 181 towards the other two cell types , especially FTW - mESCs ( Figure 4C ) . CellChat analysis also 182 predicted several signaling pathways mediating these interactions , which included signaling 183 through extracellular matrix ( ECM ) proteins such as LAMININ and COLLAGEN ( Figure 4D ) . 184 LAMININ and COLLAGEN are known components of the basement membrane ( BM ) lining the 185 basal side of the post - implantation EPI , which are in part produced by the VE in mice ( Sekiguchi 186 and Yamada , 2018 ) . We next determined whether ECM protein ( s ) could phenocopy the growth 187 restriction of co - cultured FTW - mESCs . We found supplementation of separately cultured FTW - 188 mESCs with Matrigel ( ~ 60 % LAMININ , ~ 30 % COLLAGEN IV ) , LAMININ , or COLLAGEN 189 IV , but not VITRONECTIN could inhibit FTW - mESC growth in a dosage dependent manner 190 ( Figure 4E , and Figure S4C , S4D ) . In consistent , knockout of Laminin γ 1 ( Lamc1 ) in FTW - 191 mXENs could partially rescue the growth phenotype of co - cultured FTW - mESCs ( Figure 4F and 192 Figure S4E , S4F ) . As INTEGRIN - β 1 plays an important role in ECM protein signaling and is a 193 cell surface receptor for LAMININ - γ 1 ( Barczyk et al . , 2010 ; Molè , 2021 ; Moore et al . , 2014 ) , 194 we generated integrin β 1 ( Itgb1 ) knockout FTW - mESCs . We found loss - of - function of 195 Itgb1 could also mitigate the retarded growth of co - cultured FTW - mESCs ( Figure S4G and S4H ) . 196 In addition , we studied the transcriptomic differences between separately cultured and co - 197 cultured FTW - mESCs by bulk RNA - seq . Through comparative analysis , we identified 502 198 differentially expressed genes ( DEGs ) shared between FTW - mESCs in XENs / ESCs and 199 XENs / TSCs / ESCs co - cultures , when compared to separately cultured FTW - mESCs ( Figure S4I 200 and Table S2 ) . Interestingly , the majority of DEGs ( 492 ) were down - regulated genes in co - 201 cultured FTW - mESCs . Consistent with their decreased proliferation , the down - regulated DEGs 202 included genes related to cell proliferation and embryo size ( e . g . , several members of activator 203 protein 1 [ AP - 1 ] transcription factor complex such as Fos , Fosl1 , Fosb , Batf among others ( Angel 204 et al . , 1987 ; Angel and Karin , 1991 ; Jochum et al . , 2001 ) ) ( Figure S4J ) . GO and Bioplanet 2019 205 analyses of the down - regulated DEGs revealed top enriched terms including extracellular matrix 206 8 and structure organization , Interleukin - 1 and TGF - beta regulation of extracellular matrix , and β 1 207 integrin cell surface interactions ( Figure S4K and S4L ) . In addition , we found many matrix 208 metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) ( e . g . , Mmps 2 , 3 , 9 , 10 , 12 etc . ) were down - regulated in co - cultured 209 FTW - mESCs ( Figure S4M ) . MMPs have been reported to modulate cell proliferation , migration , 210 and morphogenesis by degrading ECM proteins ( Vu , 2000 ) , and inhibition of MMPs also led to 211 reduced growth of EPI in vivo and ESCs in vitro ( Kyprianou et al . , 2020 ) , which are consistent 212 with our findings . 213 In sum , these analyses helped gain insights into the crosstalk among co - cultured embryonic and 214 extraembryonic stem cells and identified ECM signaling as one of the mechanisms mediating the 215 reduced proliferation of FTW - mESCs by FTW - mXENs ( Figure 4G ) . 216 Stem cells from monkey blastocysts 217 By using the FTW condition , we also succeeded in the derivation of several stable extra - 218 embryonic ( FTW - cyXENs and FTW - cyTSCs ) and embryonic ( FTW - cyESCs , 20 % KSR 219 [ knockout serum replacement ] was needed ) stem cell lines from 7 - 10 d . p . f . ( days post - 220 fertilization ) cynomolgus monkey blastocysts ( Figure 5A to 5D , and Table S3 ) . FTW - cyESCs 221 could also be directly converted from naïve - like ESCs ( Fang et al . , 2014 ) through culture 222 adaptation ( data not shown ) . Once established , FTW - cyXENs , FTW - cyTSCs and FTW - cyESCs 223 proliferated well , maintained stable colony morphology and normal karyotypes after long - term 224 culture , expressed hypoblast ( HYP ) , trophoblast , and EPI related genes , respectively ( Figure 5E 225 and Figure S5A to S5D , S5E to S5H , S5L , S5M ) . Upon random differentiation in vitro , FTW - 226 cyXENs could generate visceral - and yolk - sac - endoderm - ( VE / YE - ) ( FOXA1 + GATA4 - ) like 227 cells and extra - embryonic - mesenchyme - cell - ( EXMC - ) ( COL6A1 + GATA4 - ) like 228 cells ( Nakamura et al . , 2016 ; Niu et al . , 2019b ) ( Figure 5F and S5I ) . FTW - cyTSCs were capable 229 of differentiating into extravillous trophoblast ( EVT ) - like cells and multinucleated 230 syncytiotrophoblast ( SCT ) - like cells in vitro ( Figure 5G and 5H ) . ( Okae et al . , 2018 ) and in 231 TSC - teratomas ( Figure S5J and S5K ) . 232 Next , we performed transcriptomic profiling of cynomolgus monkey FTW stem cells . scRNA - 233 seq analysis revealed that FTW - cyESCs , FTW - cyXENs and FTW - cyTSCs segregated into three 234 distinct clusters on UMAP and expressed their respective lineage marker genes ( Figure 6A and 235 6B ) . Bulk RNA - seq analysis helped identify DEGs among FTW - cyESCs , FTW - cyXENs and 236 9 FTW - cyTSCs , which were enriched in GO terms including : “Signaling pathways regulating 237 pluripotency of stem cells” and “VEGF signaling pathway” ( FTW - cyESCs ) ; “ECM - receptor 238 interaction” and “TGF - beta signaling” ( FTW - cyXENs ) ; “ECM - receptor interaction” and “Hippo 239 signaling pathway” ( FTW - cyTSCs ) ( Figure 6C ) . The result of the Pearson correlation analysis 240 showed that FTW - cyESCs , FTW - cyXENs and FTW - cyTSCs shared the highest correlation 241 coefﬁcients with their in vivo counterparts ( Figure 6D ) . 242 Cross - lineage stem cell co - cultures among monkey cells 243 Next , we investigated whether the growth restriction of FTW - ESCs by FTW - XENs was 244 conserved in cynomolgus monkeys . To this end , we performed co - culture of FTW - cyESCs with 245 FTW - cyXENs and / or FTW - cyTSCs . Consistent with mouse findings , we found the growth of 246 FTW - cyESCs was greatly inhibited by FTW - cyXENs but marginally affected by FTW - cyTSCs 247 or fibroblasts ( Figure 7A , 7B and Figure S6A ) To provide mechanistic insights into embryonic 248 and extra - embryonic lineage crosstalk in cynomolgus monkeys , we performed scRNA - seq 249 analysis of co - cultures of FTW - cyESCs / FTW - cyXENs ( 2lines ) and FTW - cyESCs / FTW - 250 cyXENs / FTW - cyTSCs ( 3lines ) using 10x Genomics Chromium , and compared with single cell 251 transcriptomes derived from separate cultures ( Table S4 ) . Through DEG and GO analyses , we 252 identified several terms , e . g . , “Focal adhesion” , “Cadherin binding” , and “Cell - cell adhesion” , 253 were enriched in co - cultured FTW - cyESCs , FTW - cyXENs and FTW - cyTSCs , respectively , 254 suggesting more active cell - cell interactions ( Figure S6B to S6D ) . In agreement with mouse 255 results , CellChat analysis also predicted signaling through ECM proteins , e . g . , LAMININ and 256 COLLAGEN , mediated crosstalk between FTW - cyXENs and FTW - cyESCs ( Figure 7C , Figure 257 S6E and Table S5 ) . To confirm the effect ( s ) of ECM protein ( s ) , we supplemented Matrigel , 258 LAMININ , or COLLAGEN IV to separately cultured FTW - cyESCs , and found that each could 259 phenocopy FTW - cyXENs’ inhibitory effect on the growth of FTW - cyESCs in a dosage 260 dependent manner ( Figure 7D and Figure S6F , S6G ) . 261 Taken together , these results extended our findings in mice to cynomolgus monkeys and revealed 262 a conserved mechanism underlying growth inhibition of FTW - ESCs by FTW - XENs . 263 Cross species comparisons 264 Embryonic and extraembryonic stem cells from both mice and cynomolgus monkeys derived and 265 cultured in the same condition gave us a unique opportunity to examine species - conserved and - 266 10 divergent features not influenced by different culture parameters . Using the single - cell regulatory 267 network inference and clustering ( SCENIC ) pipeline , we first studied the regulatory networks 268 underlying the maintenance of FTW - ESCs , FTW - XENs and FTW - TSCs in both species . Our 269 analysis identified several conserved and species - specific transcription factor ( TF ) - driven 270 regulons in each stem cell type ( Figure S7A to S7C ) . SCENIC analysis also revealed common 271 and distinct targets of well - known lineage TFs such as NANOG , SOX17 and GATA3 ( Figure 272 S7A to S7C and Table S6 ) . We next performed cross - species comparison of 273 intercommunications between lineages , which uncovered both species - conserved ( e . g . , MK , 274 LAMININ , COLLAGEN and FN1 ) and - divergent ( e . g . , CDH , AGRN and HSPG [ mouse ] ; FGF , 275 NCAM and BMP [ monkey ] ) signaling crosstalk ( Figure S7D ) . Collectively , these results reveal 276 interspecies transcriptomic similarities and differences in early embryonic and extraembryonic 277 cells and their intercommunications , which provide insights into evolutionary convergent and 278 divergent processes underlying epiblast , hypoblast and trophoblast development across different 279 species in vivo . 280 DISCUSSION 281 Most stem cell cultures include pathway inhibitors to suppress differentiation in favor of self - 282 renewal , e . g . , ground state mouse ESC culture ( Ying et al . , 2008 ) , which often necessitate the 283 design of new conditions for different stem cell types and different species . By activating 284 multiple developmental signaling pathways at once , surprisingly , we found several embryonic 285 ( mouse , cynomolgus monkey , and horse ) and extraembryonic stem cells ( mouse and cynomolgus 286 monkey ) from multiple species could be derived and stably maintained in the same condition 287 ( Wu et al . , 2017 ; Yu et al . , 2021b ) . This signaling “excited” state can potentially be attained in a 288 variety of stem cell types by striking a balance between differentiation and self - renewal via 289 switching on a combination of signaling pathways including but not limited to FGF , TGF - β and 290 WNT pathways used in this study . 291 The ability to grow embryonic and extraembryonic stem cells in the same culture environment 292 opens new avenues to dissect the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying lineage 293 crosstalk during early mammalian development . Based on FTW stem cell co - cultures , we have 294 uncovered a previously unrecognized non - cell autonomous control of pluripotent cell 295 proliferation by extraembryonic endoderm cells , which is in part mediated by the ECM signaling , 296 11 in both mice and cynomolgus monkeys . We further revealed a similar overgrowth phenotype in 297 mouse epiblast in the absence of visceral endoderm , providing evidence supporting the in vivo 298 relevance of the observed proliferation restriction . Consistant with this finding , it was previously 299 reported that MMP - mediated basement membrane perforations at the posterior side of the mouse 300 embryo permited growth and primitive - streak extension during peri - gastrulation development 301 ( Kyprianou et al . , 2020 ) . 302 Our study identified laminin - integrin signaling contributed to the growth restriction of FTW - 303 mESCs by FTW - mXENs ( Figure 4D - 4F and Figure S4C - S4F ) . This is likely due to irregularly 304 distributed matrix materials surrounding integrin β 1 - deficient FTW - mESCs during co - culture 305 with FTW - mXENs as opposed to a continuous basement membrane layer in WT FTW - mESCs 306 ( Moore et al . , 2014 ) . A previous study demonstrated that integrin β 1 - deficient mESCs underwent 307 massive cell death during transition from naive pluripotency toward the formative pluripotency 308 ( Molè , 2021 ) . This seemingly contrasts with integrin β 1 - deficient formative FTW - mESCs 309 ( Figures S4G , S4H ) . A possible explaination is that despite FTW - mESCs exhibited functional 310 formative features including the ability to form blastocyst chimeras and direct responsiveness to 311 primordial germ cell specification , they retain the expression of many naïve pluripotency genes 312 and are recognized as more naïve - like formative PSCs as apposed to more primed - like formative 313 stem ( FS ) cells ( Kinoshita et al . , 2021 ; Yu et al . , 2021b ) . In consistent , the induction of of 314 apoptosis of integrin β 1 - deficient mESCs during differetnation was found concomitant with the 315 upregulation of OTX2 , and OTX2 level was found low in FTW - mESCs ( Molè , 2021 ) . 316 The recent advancements in both extended primate ( human and cynomolgus monkey ) embryo 317 cultures and stem cell embryo models provide an unprescendented opportunity to study primate 318 early post - implantation development ( Deglincerti et al . , 2016 ; Ma et al . , 2019 ; Moris et al . , 2020 ; 319 Niu et al . , 2019a ; Shahbazi et al . , 2016 ; Yu et al . , 2022 ; Yu et al . , 2021a ; Zheng et al . , 2019 ) . 320 However , the dynamic nature of a developing embryo / embryo model and its cellular complexity 321 make it difficult to dissect the key cell - cell interactions . Here , the establishment of cynomolgus 322 monkey FTW - ESCs , XENs and TSCs under the same condition enables us , for the first time , to 323 delineate cell - cell interactions in a tractable and accessible manner in primates . In future studies , 324 the combination of stem cell co - culture with CRISPR screens will help uncover additional genes 325 12 and pathways underlying the crosstalk between extraembryonic and embryonic cells during 326 embryogenesis in primates . 327 In sum , the FTW embryonic and extraembryonic stem cells and the co - culture strategy 328 developed in this study may help provide superior starting cells for generating more robust 329 integrated stem cell embryo models ( Fu et al . , 2021 ) and developing more faithful differentiation 330 protocols for regenerative medicine . 331 332 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS 333 We thank Janet Rossant for providing the GFP labelled conventional mouse XEN and TSCs .

Cross - species comparison . 473 474 475 METHOD DETAILS 476 Mice . 477 C57BL / 6 and CD - 1 ( ICR ) mice were purchased from Charles River or Envigo ( Harlen ) . NOD - 478 SCID ( NOD . CB17 - Prkdc scid / J ) mice were purchased from the Jackson Lab . Mice were housed in 479 12 - hr light / 12 - hr dark cycle at 22 . 1 – 22 . 3°C and 33 – 44 % humidity . All procedures related to 480 animals were performed in accordance with the ethical guidelines of the University of Texas 481 Southwestern Medical Center . The animal protocol was reviewed and approved by the UT 482 Southwestern Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee ( IACUC ) [ Protocol # 2018 - 102430 ] . 483 All experiments followed the 2021 Guidelines for Stem Cell Research and Clinical Translation 484 released by the International Society for Stem Cell Research ( ISSCR ) . Human - mouse chimeric 485 studies were reviewed and approved by the UT Southwestern Stem Cell Oversight Committee 486 ( SCRO ) [ Registration # 14 ] . 487 Cynomolgus Monkeys . 488 All animals and experimental procedures were approved in 2021 by the ethical committee of the 489 LPBR and Institute of Primate Translational Medicine and Kunming University of Science and 490 Technology ( IPTM , KUST ) ， and performed by following the guidelines of the Association for 491 Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International ( AAALAC ) for the 492 ethical treatment of non - human primates . 2 healthy female cynomolgus monkeys ( Macaca 493 fascicularis ) , ranging in age from 5 to 8 years with body weights of 4 to 6 kg , were selected for 494 18 use in this study . All animals were housed at the State Key Laboratory of Primate Biomedical 495 Research ( LPBR ) . All cynomolgus monkey embryos related work was conducted at the State 496 Key Laboratory of Primate Biomedical Research . 497 Harvesting and culture of mouse embryos . 498 C57BL / 6 female mice ( 8 – 10 weeks old ) were super ovulated by intraperitoneal ( IP ) injection 499 with 5 IU of PMSG ( Prospec ) , followed by IP injection with 5 IU of hCG ( Sigma - Aldrich ) 48 h 500 later . After mating with C57BL / 6 male mice , embryos at 8 - cell to morula stages were harvested 501 at E2 . 75 [ the presence of a virginal plug was defined as embryonic day 0 . 5 ( E0 . 5 ) ) in KSOM - 502 HEPES by flushing oviducts and uterine horns . Embryos were cultured in the mKSOMaa 503 overnight until blastocyst stage in a humidified atmosphere containing 5 % ( v / v ) CO 2 and 5 % 504 ( v / v ) O 2 at 37 °C . CD - 1 females ( 8 weeks old or older ) in natural estrous cycles were mated with 505 CD - 1 males . Blastocysts were harvested at E3 . 5 by flushing uterine horns . 506 Derivation and culture of FTW - mXENs , FTW - mTSCs and FTW - mESCs . 507 Embryo manipulations were performed under a dissection microscope ( Nikon SMZ800N ) . In 508 brief , zona pellucidae ( ZP ) were removed from E3 . 5 blastocysts by brief treatment with acidic 509 Tyrode’s solution ( Millipore MR - 004 - D ) . After removing zona pellucidae , embryos were plated 510 on MEFs in FTW medium [ N2B27 basal medium supplemented with FGF2 ( 20 ng / mL , 511 Peprotech ) , Activin - A ( 20 ng / mL , Peprotech ) and CHIR99021 ( 3 μ M , Selleckchem ) . After 6 - 8 512 days in culture , blastocyst outgrowths were passaged using TrypLE and re - seeded onto newly 513 prepared MEFs . XEN , TSC , and ESC colonies were manually picked for further cultivation . 514 Established mouse XEN , TSC , and ESC lines were cultured on MEFs plates pre - coated with 0 . 1 % 515 gelatin in FTW medium . The cells were cultured at 37 °C under 5 % CO 2 , with daily media 516 changes . For passaging , the cells were dissociated into single cells using TrypLE Express 517 ( GIBCO ) and passaged onto new MEF - coated plates at a split ratio of 1 : 20 ( FTW - mESCs ) , 1 : 10 518 ( FTW - mTSCs ) , and 1 : 50 ( FTW - mXEN ) every 3 – 4 days . 519 Generation of fluorescent mouse FTW cells . 520 We used pCAG - IP - mKO or pCAG - IP - eGFP to label FTW - mXENs , FTW - mTSCs , and FTW - 521 mESCs . In brief , 1 – 2 μ g of pCAG - IP - mKO / eGFP plasmids were transfected into 1 × 10 6 – 2 × 522 10 6 dissociated single cells using an electroporator ( NEPA21 , Nepa Gene ) following the protocol 523 recommended by the manufacturer . Then , 0 . 5 – 1 . 0 μ g ml - 1 of puromycin ( Invitrogen ) was added 524 19 to the culture medium 2 – 3 days after transfection . Drug - resistant colonies were manually picked 525 between 7 to 14 days and further expanded clonally . 526 In vitro differentiation of FTW - mTSCs and FTW - mXENs . 527 FTW - XENs were dissociated into single cells using TrypLE Express and seeded into a 6 - well 528 plate pre - coated with 5 μ g / mL Laminin at a density of 2 × 10 5 cells ( mouse XEN ) or 5 × 10 5 cells 529 ( monkey and human XEN ) per well in XEN differentiation medium for 9 days , with medium 530 changes every other day . XEN differentiation medium was prepared using the following : 1 : 1 ( v / v ) 531 mixture of DMEM / F12 and Neurobasal medium , 1X N2 supplement , 1X B27 minus insulin 532 supplement , 1X GlutaMAX , 1X Nonessential amino acids , 0 . 1 mM β - mercaptoethanol , 0 . 5 % 533 Penicillin - Streptomycin , and 10 % FBS . 534 Harvesting and culture of cynomolgus embryos . 535 Cynomolgus monkey ( Macaca fasicularis ) ovarian stimulation , oocyte recovery and in vitro 536 fertilization were performed as previously described ( Niu et al . , 2014 ) . Briefly , healthy female 537 cynomolgus monkeys were subjected to follicular stimulation by intramuscular injection of 20 538 IU of recombinant human follitropin alpha ( rhFSH , Gonal F , Merck Serono ) for 8 days , then 539 1 , 000 IU recombinant human chorionic gonadotropin alpha ( rhCG , OVIDREL , Merck Serono ) 540 was injected on day 9 . Cumulus - oocyte complexes were collected by laparoscopic follicular 541 aspiration 32 - 35 hours following rhCG administration . Follicular contents were placed in 542 HEPES - buffered Tyrode’s albumin lactate pyruvate ( TALP ) medium containing 0 . 3 % bovine 543 serum albumin ( BSA ) ( Sigma - Aldrich ) at 37°C . Oocytes were stripped of cumulus cells by 544 pipetting after a brief exposure ( < 1 min ) to hyaluronidase ( 0 . 5 mg / mL ) in TALP - HEPES to 545 allow visual selection of nuclear maturity metaphase II ( MII ; first polar body present ) oocytes . 546 The maturity oocytes were subjected to intracytoplasmic sperm injection ( ICSI ) immediately and 547 then cultured in CMRL - 1066 medium ( Gibco , 11530037 ) containing 10 % FBS at 37°C in 5 % 548 CO2 . Fertilization was confirmed by the presence of the second polar body and two pronuclei . 549 Zygotes were then cultured in the chemically defined hamster embryo culture medium - 9 550 ( HECM - 9 ) containing 10 % fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 5 % CO2 to allow embryo 551 development . The blastocysts were collected at 7 days post fertilization ( d . p . f . ) . The zona 552 pellucida of blastocyst was removed by exposure to hyaluronidase from bovine testes ( Sigma - 553 Aldrich ) about 30 seconds and embryos were cultured in vitro until 10 days post fertilization . 554 Derivation and culture of FTW - cyXENs , FTW - cyTSCs , FTW - cyESCs . 555 20 For the derivation of FTW - cyXENs and FTW - cyTSCs , 10 d . p . f . cynomolgus monkey embryos 556 were dissected with a 31 - gauge syringe needle and plated into wells of 4 - well dish coated with 557 0 . 1 % gelatin and covered with mitotically inactivated MEF in FTW medium ( done the same way 558 as with mouse ) . To promote the proliferation of hypoblast , 1 % KSR ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , 559 A3181502 ) and PDGF ( 10 ng / mL , R & D , 220 - BB ) were also added ( Zhong et al . , 2018 ) . After 8 - 560 10 days , XEN - like and TS - like colonies appeared . Single colonies were isolated and then 561 dissociated by TrypLE ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , 12604021 ) for 3 minutes at 37 °C , and 562 passaged into a well of a 4 - well dish . Established FTW - cyXENs and FTW - cyTSCs were 563 passaged by TrypLE every 6 - 7 days ( monkey ) at a split ratio of 1 : 10 in FTW medium under 20 % 564 O 2 and 5 % CO 2 at 37 (cid:3) . To derive FTW - cyESCs ( Kang et al . , 2018 ) , blastocysts ( 7 days p . c . ) 565 were plated into a well of 4 - well dish coated with 0 . 1 % gelatin and MEFs in FTW cyESC 566 medium [ N2B27 basal medium supplemented with 20 % KSR , FGF2 ( 6 ng / mL , Peprotech ) , 567 Activin - A ( 25 ng / mL , Peprotech ) and CHIR99021 ( 1 . 5 μ M , Selleckchem ) ] under 5 % O 2 and 5 % 568 CO 2 . After 8 - 10 days , the ES - like outgrowths appeared and were dissociated using TrypLE for 3 569 minutes at 37 °C . The established FTW - cyESCs were cultured in a 6 - well plate pre - coated with 570 0 . 1 % gelatin MEFs in FTW cyESC medium under 20 % O 2 and 5 % CO 2 at 37 (cid:3) . 571 In vitro Differentiation of FTW - cyXENs . 572 To induce differentiation , FTW - cyXENs were dissociated into single cells using TrypLE and 573 seeded into a 6 - well plate pre - coated with 5 μ g / mL Laminin at a density of 5 × 10 5 cells per well 574 and kept in differentiation medium for 9 days with medium changes every other day . 575 Differentiation medium was prepared as following : 1 : 1 ( v / v ) mixture of DMEM / F12 and 576 Neurobasal medium , 0 . 5X N2 supplement , 0 . 5X B27 supplement , 1 % GlutaMAX , 1 % 577 Nonessential amino acids , 0 . 1 mM β - Mercaptoethanol , 1 % Penicillin - Streptomycin , and 10 % 578 FBS . 579 In vitro Differentiation of FTW - cyTSCs . 580 FTW - cyTSCs were differentiated into ST and EVT as the described with human cells ( Okae et al . , 581 2018 ) .

Between 650 each step , the samples were washed twice with PBS containing 2 % FBS . Finally , the stained 651 cells were suspended in PBS containing 2 % FBS and analyzed by flow cytometry ( FACScalibur 652 system , BD ) . 653 Blastocyst injection of FTW - mXENs and mouse FTW - mTSCs . 654 FTW - mXEN injection into mouse blastocysts was performed as described previously ( Yu et al . , 655 2021b ) with slight modifications . Briefly , single cell suspensions of mouse and human FTW - 656 mXENs were added to a 40 μ L droplet of KSOM - HEPES containing the blastocysts and placed 657 on an inverted microscope ( Nikon ) fitted with micromanipulators ( Narishige ) . Individual cells 658 were collected into a micropipette with 15 – 20 μ m internal diameter ( ID ) , and a Piezo Micro 659 Manipulator ( Prime Tech ) was used to create a hole in the zona pellucida and trophectoderm 660 layer of mouse blastocysts . 10 - 12 ( FTW - mXEN / FTW - mTSCs ) cells were introduced into the 661 blastocoel . After microinjection , the blastocysts were cultured in mKSOMaa . For mouse embryo 662 transfer , 8 – 12 weeks old ICR female mice were used as surrogates and were mated with 663 vasectomized ICR male mice to induce pseudopregnancy . Ketamine ( 30 mg / ml ) / Xylazine ( 4 664 mg / mL ) and Buprenorphine ( 1 mg / mL ) were used in surgery for maintaining anesthesia and 665 relieving pain .

The seeding 685 ratio and density were empirically tested and decided on the basis of cell growth rate . A starting 686 number of FTW - mESCs - eGFP ( 1 . 5 × 10 4 cells ) , FTW - mTSCs - WT ( 3 × 10 4 cells , and FTW - 687 mXENs - mKO ( 7 . 5 × 10 3 cells ) were decided on for most of the cell - cell co - culture assays . 688 During co - culture experiments , cells were cultured in FTW medium on MEFs for 5 days and the 689 following analyses were performed . For co - culture experiments with various different cell ratios , 690 FTW - mESCs - eGFP were seeded at a fixed cell number ( 1 . 5 × 10 4 cells per well ) and with 691 varying numbers of FTW - mTSCs - WT and / or FTW - mXENs - WT . 692 For 3D co - culture , AggreWell™800 was used to form Embryoid bodies ( EBs ) . For separate 693 culture experiments , FTW - mESCs - eGFP were seeded into an AggreWell™800 with 2 . 4 × 10 5 694 cells per well ( 800 cells per microwell ) , and for co - culture experiments , 2 . 4 × 10 5 cells FTW - 695 mESCs - eGFP and 1 . 2 × 10 5 FTW - mXENs - WT were added per well ( 400 cells per microwell ) . 696 The next day , EBs were transferred into 6 - well low - attachment plates for further culture . Media 697 was changed every day for 4 days using FTW medium . For 3D co - culture experiments with 698 different ratios , FTW - mESCs - eGFP were seeded at the fixed density of 2 . 4 × 10 5 cells per well 699 and with varying densities of FTW - mXENs - WT . 700 For the differentiation co - culture experiments , FTW - mESCs - eGFP and FTW - mXENs - mKO 701 were seeded , and the medium was switched to differentiation medium containing DMEM / F12 702 supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) the next day .

MEFs were coated on the top / 707 bottom well . For separate culture groups , FTW - mESCs - eGFP ( 5000 cells ) were seeded on the 708 bottom wells , but not the top insert . For co - culture groups , FTW - mESCs - eGFP ( 5000 cells ) and 709 25 FTW - mXENs - WT ( 2500 cells ) were seeded on the bottom and top insert of the wells , 710 respectively . Half of the medium was changed every day and cell numbers were counted on day 711 5 . 712 Mouse ECM protein inhibition assay . 713 Mouse FTW - mESC - GFP cells were passaged using TrypLE and seeded in a well of 6 - well plate 714 at 1 . 5 × 10 4 cells in FTW cyESC medium under 20 % O 2 and 5 % CO 2 at 37 (cid:3) . After 4 hours , the 715 ECM protein mixtures ( Matrigel _ L : 0 . 5 % ( v / v ) , Matrigel _ H : 2 % ( v / v ) , Laminin _ L : 30 μ g / ml , 716 Laminin _ H : 120 μ g / ml , Collagen _ L : 15 μ g / ml , Collagen _ H : 60 μ g / ml , Vitronectin _ L : 5 μ g / ml , 717 Vitronectin _ H : 30 μ g / ml ) were directly added into the culture medium every day for 5 days . 718 Medium and ECM proteins were changed every day . 719 Monkey cell - cell co - culture assay . 720 FTW - cyESCs - GFP , FTW - cyTSCs - WT , and FTW - cyXENs - mKO or WT were seeded onto 721 MEF - coated plates and mixed at different ratios for co - culture experiments . The seeding ratios 722 and densities were empirically tested and decided on the basis of cell growth rate . These numbers 723 were : FTW - cyESCs - GFP ( 5 × 10 4 cells ) , FTW - cyTSCs - WT ( 30 × 10 4 cells , and FTW - cyXENs - 724 mKO / WT ( 35 × 10 4 cells ) . During co - culture experiments , cells were cultured in MEF - coated 725 plates in FTW cyESC medium for 5 days . 726 Monkey ECM protein inhibition assay . 727 Monkey FTW - cyESC - GFP cells were passaged by treatment with TrypLE and 5 × 10 4 cells were 728 seeded into a well of 6 - well plate in FTW medium under 20 % O 2 and 5 % CO 2 at 37 (cid:3) . After 4 729 hours , ECM mixtures were added ( Matrigel : 0 . 5 % , 2 % ; Laminin : 2 . 5 μ g / ml , 10 μ g / ml ; 730 Collagen (cid:3) : 15 μ g / ml , 60 μ g / ml ) directly added into the culture medium every day for 5 days . 731 Medium and ECM proteins were changed every day . 732 Total FTW - mESCs / cyESCs number counting . 733 For all of the co - culture experiments , total ES cell numbers were quantified in the following 734 manner . Cells were dissociated into single cells using TrypLE Express at 37 °C for 4 min , and 735 the total number of live cells were counted . Next , the relative percentage of eGFP + FTW - ESCs - 736 eGFP were determined using an LSR II Flow Cytometer ( BD Bioscience ) . Total ES cell number 737 ( tN ) for each group in both the co - cultured and separate culture conditions were determined by 738 multiplying total cell volume ( V ) with cell concentration ( CC ) and percentage of eGFP + cells ( P ) . 739 26 tN = V × CC × P . Cell density ( cells cm - 2 ) was calculated by dividing the total cell number by 740 the surface area . 741 Colony Size and intensity analysis . 742 All of the co - culture experiments involving colony size and intensity were analyzed in the 743 following method . On day 5 of co - culture , fluorescently labeled cells were imaged with a Leica 744 Microsystem DMi8 microscope using Leica Application Suite X software for analysis . The 745 images were taken randomly by the software in a fixed area for each well and A Fiji pipeline was 746 used to quantify the size and intensity of the ESCs colonies . Briefly , images are preprocessed 747 with median filters to filter out noise and small debris , binary images are then created through 748 Otsu thresholding , and watershed was applied to separate merged clones . The quantification was 749 implemented with the Analyze Particles function of Fiji based on the binary images created 750 earlier . The average ESC colony Pixels ( P ) for each group in co - cultures and separate cultures 751 were determined by multiplying colony Size ( A ) with colony intensity ( I ) . P = A × I . For mouse 752 cell experiments , there were three independent biological replicates for each group and 3 images 753 for each sample . All of the colonies from 9 images were analyzed . For monkey cell experiments , 754 10 images were taken randomly and all of the colonies were analyzed in the 10 images . 755 E6 . 5 epiblasts in - vitro cultivation assay with or without visceral endoderm . 756 To obtain embryos , ICR females were mated with males from ICR ( Charles River Laboratories ) 757 in the afternoon , and the presence of vaginal plugs was checked the next morning . The day on 758 which a plug was found was considered to be E0 . 5 . Both male and female mice were used at 759 ages between 6 to 25 weeks . All the animal experiments were performed under the ethical 760 guidelines of the Kindai University , and animal protocols were reviewed and approved by the 761 Kindai University Animal Care and Use Committee . The developmental stage of embryos is 762 critical for adapting the cultivation of isolated epiblast to an STO - conditioned medium . The 763 isolated epiblasts before the onset of gastrulation collapsed in culture , while those after at onset 764 of gastrulation were stable for growth in an STO - conditioned medium and were applicable for 765 further experiments . The embryos at E6 . 5 - 6 . 75 were surgically isolated in cold DMEM 766 supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum ( FCS , BioWest ) , and whole epiblasts were isolated by 767 the mechanical removal of Reichert’s membrane , extra - embryonic ectoderm as well as visceral 768 endoderm , depending on the cases , using fine forceps and a tungsten needle . The isolated 769 epiblasts with or without visceral endoderm were plated into Nunclon Sphera - treated , 96 - well U - 770 27 shaped - bottom microplate ( 174925 , Thermo Scientific ) in STO - conditioned medium . The STO - 771 conditioned medium was prepared as follows . Dulbecco ' s Modified Eagle ' s Medium ( DMEM , 772 SIGMA ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS , Gibco ) and 1 % Penicillin - 773 Streptomycin ( 10 , 000 U / mL , Gibco ) was used to culture Mitomycin - C inactivated STO feeders 774 for 2 days . After 48 hours , cultured epiblast outgrowths including visceral endoderm in the case 775 were dissociated with TrypLE ( Gibco , 12604013 ) , and the total cell number was counted . 776 Bulk RNA - sequencing . 777 RNA extraction was performed using an RNeasy Mini Kit ( QIAGEN ) using DNase treatment 778 ( QIAGEN ) . RNA was analyzed using a 2100 Bioanalyzer ( Aglient Technologies ) . ( Transcripts 779 per Kilobase Million ) . For monkey cells , RNA was extracted with Trizol Reagent ( 15596026 , 780 Invitrogen ) . The RNA ( ~ 50 ng ) reverse transcription reaction and amplification were performed 781 using SuperScript II ( 18064 - 071 , Invitrogen ) , and KAPA HiFi HotStart Ready Mix ( KK2602 , 782 KAPA ) . The cDNA was analyzed using a 2100 Bioanalyzer ( Aglient Technologies ) . The RNA 783 Library was generated using TruePrep DNA Library Prep Kit V2 for Illumina ( TD501 , Vazyme ) , 784 then the library was adapted for sequencing on an Illmina NovaSeq 6000 platform ( sequenced by 785 Annoroad ) . 786 Pre - processing of raw RNA - seq data . 787 All reads were mapped to the mouse ( GRCm38 / mm10 ) , human ( GRCh38 / hg38 ) , and rhesus 788 macaque genome ( Mmul _ 10 / rheMac10 ) using hisat2 ( version 2 . 2 . 1 ) with default settings . 789 FeatureCoumt ( version 2 . 0 . 1 ) was used to estimate read counts . Stringtie ( version 2 . 1 . 4 ) was 790 used to estimate fragments per kilobase of exon per million fragments mapped ( FPKM ) and 791 transcripts per kilobase of exon model per million mapped reads ( TPM ) values according to a 792 previous report ( Kovaka et al . , 2019 ) , genes with an FPKM value ≥ 3 were considered as 793 expressed . 794 Comparison analysis with published available datasets . 795 The previously published datasets including mouse ( Bao et al . , 2018 ; Cruz - Molina et al . , 2017 ; 796 Cui et al . , 2019 ; Kubaczka et al . , 2015 ; Mohammed et al . , 2017 ; Wu et al . , 2015 ; Wu et al . , 797 2011 ; Ye et al . , 2018 ; Zhao et al . , 2015 ; Zhong et al . , 2018 ) , human ( Linneberg - Agerholm et al . , 798 2019 ; Xiang et al . , 2020 ; Zhou et al . , 2019 ) and monkey ( Ma et al . , 2019 ; Nakamura et al . , 2016 ; 799 Niu et al . , 2019b ) embryonic single - cell RNA sequencing and mouse cell lines ( nEND ) 800 microarray datasets ( Anderson et al . , 2017 ) were obtained from GEO repository ( NCBI ) and 801 28 incorporated into our analysis . The expression levels of scRNA - seq data were transformed into 802 log2 ( TPM + 1 ) , and those of microarray data were transformed into log2 ( intensity ) . 803 Principal components analysis ( PCA ) . 804 The principal component analysis ( PCA ) was performed using the prcomp function without 805 scaling . The DEGs were defined as genes exhibiting more than twofold changes between the 806 samples ( P < 0 . 005 ) and the sum of the expression level of every gene was log2 ( TPM + 1 ) > 0 807 with the variance > 0 . 808 Similarities inference between cells . 809 We selected the union of the top 2000 genes of highest variance for our dataset and the published 810 dataset and calculated 20 canonical correlates ( CCs ) with diagonal CCA . After running CCA , the 811 first 10 CCs were used for t - SNE visualization . The homology cell types were co - clustered in the 812 same CCA cluster . Then , the correlation analysis was employed to detect the correspondence of 813 cell subtype for our cells and the previous published embryonic cells by using expression matrix 814 of 200 high variable genes that contributed to the first 10 CCs . 815 Differential expression and GO and KEGG pathway analysis . 816 Differentially expressed genes ( DEGs ) among clusters were detected by the Seurat function 817 “Find All Markers” . Heatmaps showing the expression distribution of marker genes of cell 818 clusters were created by pheatmap R package . We used the functions enrichKEGG and 819 enrichGO in clusterProfiler R package ( Yu et al . , 2012 ) to perform KEGG pathways ( Kanehisa et 820 al . , 2019 ) and Gene Ontology ( GO ) biological processes enrichment analysis . A pathway or 821 process with a P value ≤ 0 . 05 was considered to be significantly enriched . The enriched 822 pathways and processes were visualized with the ‘‘ggplot’’ function in the ggplot2 package in R . 823 Single cell samples preparation . 824 Mouse blastocysts were collected at E3 . 5 and the zona pellucida removed by Tyler’s buffer as 825 described previously ( Yu et al . , 2021b ) . After removing the zona , blastocysts were washed in 826 PBS / PVA two times . Digestion was performed in TrypLE Express for 10 minutes at 37 (cid:3) , and 827 cell clumps were cut up by mouth glass pipettes beginning with a larger size ( 50 um diameter ) to 828 a smaller size ( 20 um diameter ) . The totally digestion time was around 40 - 50 minutes . For the 829 FTW - derive - day 8 outgrowth samples , blastocysts were collected and plated onto MEF - coated 830 plates in FTW medium for 8 days , and then the outgrowth area were picked and dissociated . For 831 29 the established FTW cell lines , all the cells were dissociated with TripLE Express for 3 - 5 832 minutes at 37 (cid:3) . 833 scRNA - seq library preparing and sequencing . 834 Single cell suspensions were diluted at a concentration of 1100 cells / µL in 0 . 04 % bovine serum 835 albumin ( BSA ) / PBS for loading into 10X Chromium Single Cell G Chips ( for mouse blastocysts , 836 all the of the cells were loaded into the chip ) . Single cell libraries were prepared using the 837 Chromium Single Cell 3’ Reagent Kit v3 . 1 ( 10X Genomics , Pleasanton , CA ) following the 838 manufacturer’s protocol . Briefly , single cells were partitioned into Gel beads in EMulsion 839 ( GEMs ) in the GemCode instrument followed by cell lysis and barcoded reverse transcription of 840 RNA , amplification , shearing and 5’ adaptor and sample index attachment . Libraries were 841 sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform . 842 scRNA - seq data analysis . 843 Single - cell gene expression count matrix was constructed with Cell Ranger ( v6 . 0 . 0 ) . The 844 subsequent analyses were performed using the Seurat package ( v4 . 6 . 0 ) ( Hao et al . , 2021 ) . For 845 each dataset , transcription noise cells were removed by a series of criteria , including minimal 846 expression of 200 genes per cell , mitochondrial read percentage (cid:3) < (cid:3) 20 % , ribosomal read 847 percentage > 5 % , as well as specific minimal / maximal number of genes and maximal reads for 848 each dataset . For the monkey , after stringent quality filtering , we generated 35987 single cell 849 transcriptomes with a median unique molecular identifier ( UMI ) of 22277 and gene number of 850 5436 . Cells passed quality control were merged and normalized using Seurat’s SCT method . 851 Datasets from different sources were integrated using Seurat’s CCA method . The UMAP 852 dimensional reduction was performed using the first 30 PCs from the PCA analysis . Cells were 853 then clustered using the FindClusters function in Seurat package . Cell identities were annotated 854 based on the expression of cell marker genes . To examine the correlation among cell clusters , we 855 first performed PCA analysis for each cell cluster and then carried out correlation analysis using 856 the PC1s extracted from the cell clusters . 857 Cell clustering by nonlinear dimensional reduction . 858 To remove the influence of different experimental conditions on the samples , batch effect 859 correction was carried out . Briefly , following the standard processing steps , including use of 860 “SelectIntegrationFeatures” function to select 2 , 000 feature genes , “FindIntegrationAnchors” 861 function to find a set of anchors between different samples , “IntegrateData” function to integrate 862 30 data , “RunPCA” and “RunUMAP” function select 30 PCs dimensionality reduction , “DimPlot” 863 function to graphs the output of a dimensional reduction technique on a 2D scatter plot . The 864 Seurat package was applied to perform cell clustering analysis based on TPM expression values , 865 and only the genes with an expression level greater than 5 were included for further analysis . 866 Then uniform manifold approximation and projection ( UMAP ) were applied for visualization . 867 First , ‘‘FindIntegrationAnchors’’ function took these objects as input with parameters as 868 ‘‘k . anchor = 5 , anchor . features = 2000’’ and returned an anchor object . Then , ‘‘IntegrateData’’ 869 function used the anchor object to integrate all data - sets with the default parameter . Finally , the 870 top - 10 / 30 principal components ( PCs ) were used for clustering ( with a resolution of 1 ) by Seurat . 871 Pseudotime trajectory analysis . 872 Slingshot ( Street et al . , 2018 ) was used to determine cell Pseudotime trajectories . Frist , the object 873 that determines the cell type is passed into the “SingleCellExperiment” sim object . Then use a 874 “Rtsne” function to dimensionality reduction ( dims = 2 , perplexity = 10 , pca = TURE , pca _ scale 875 = FALSE , normalize = FALSE ) . Slingshot analysis was then performed on the diffusion map to 876 determine per - cell pseudotime estimates and mapped back to the UMAP embedding . 877 Gene regulatory networks . 878 Single cell regulatory network inference and clustering ( SCENIC ) ( Aibar et al . , 2017 ) has been 879 used to infer gene regulatory networks based on single cell expression profiles and identify cell 880 states , providing important biological insights into the mechanism of cell heterogeneity . To 881 identify important transcriptional regulation during cell development , we used pySCENIC 882 grn / ctx / aucell of the Python module tool pySCENIC to obtain core regulatory TF . The workflow 883 first describes the input single - cell expression abundance profile matrix and applies a per - target 884 regression method ( GRNBoost2 ) to infer co - expression modules from which indirect targets are 885 pruned based on cis - regulatory motif discovery ( cisTarget ) . Subsequently , the activity of these 886 regulatory factors was quantified using aucells , and the regulatory factor activity score ( RAS ) 887 was obtained by enrichment and scoring the target genes of the regulatory factors . The regulator 888 specificity score ( RSS ) was calculated based on Jensen - Shannon divergence ( JS ) to determine 889 the cluster - specific regulators , this process is implemented through R language “calcRSS” 890 function and visualized through ggplot2 . 891 Cell - cell communication analysis . 892 31 To compare the changes of the cell - cell interactions among ES , TS and XEN between the co - 893 culture and separate culture conditions , we performed cell - cell communication analysis using the 894 CellChat package ( Jin et al . , 2021 ) . Following the official workflow , we calculated the potential 895 ligand - receptor interactions among the three cell lineages in each condition and then compared 896 the numbers and strength of these interactions between the two conditions . Briefly , loaded the 897 normalized counts into CellChat and applied the standard preprocessing steps , including the 898 functions “identifyOverExpressedGenes” , “identifyOverExpressedInteractions” , and 899 “projectData” with a standard parameter set . We then calculated the potential ligand - receptor 900 interactions between infected and non - infected cells based on the functions 901 “computeCommunProb” , “computeCommunProbPathway” , and “aggregateNet” using standard 902 parameters , all of the above procedures use default parameters . 903 CRISPR knockout . 904 We used the online software Benchling CRISPR to design all single guide RNAs ( sgRNAs ) used 905 in this study . The sequences of sgRNAs are included in Table S7 . sgRNAs were cloned into the 906 pSpCas9 ( BB ) - 2A - eGFP ( Addgene , PX458 ) plasmid by ligating annealed oligonucleotides with 907 BbsI - digested vector . The plasmid carrying the specific sgRNA was then transfected into FTW - 908 mESCs or FTW - mXENs by using an electroporator ( NEPA2 , Nepa Gene 1 ) . EGFP positive cells 909 were sorted by flow cytometry after 48 h transfection and 2000 cells were plated in one well of a 910 6 well plate . Single clones were picked and expanded . Homozygous knockout clones were 911 confirmed by Sanger sequencing . 912 Plasmids . 913 pSpCas9 ( BB ) - 2A - eGFP ( PX458 ) plasmid was purchased from Addgene ( plasmid 48138 ) . 914 pCAG - IP - mKO , pCAG - IP - eGFP plasmids were obtained from T . Hishida . 915 Statistical Analysis . 916 All quantitative data is presented as the mean ± SD . Experiments were repeated at least three 917 times ( repeat number was indicated as “n” in figure legends ) . Differences between groups were 918 evaluated by Student’s t - test ( two - sided ) . P values are shown in the figures . Graphic analyses 919 were done using GraphPad Prism version 7 . 0 and 8 . 0 ( GraphPad Software , La Jolla , Ca ) and 920 Microsoft Excel ( Microsoft 365 ) . 921 922 REFERENCES 923 32 Aibar , S . , González - Blas , C .
