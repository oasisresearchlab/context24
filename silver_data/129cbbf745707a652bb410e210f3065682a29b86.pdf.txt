Role of SP65 in Assembly of the Dictyostelium discoideum Spore Coat (cid:1) Talibah Metcalf , 1 † Hanke van der Wel , 1 Ricardo Escalante , 2 Leandro Sastre , 2 and Christopher M .

Spore coat assembly is initiated by exocytosis of protein and polysac - charide precursors at the cell surface , followed by the infusion of nascent cellulose ﬁbrils , resulting in an asymmetrical trilaminar sandwich with cellulose ﬁlling the middle layer . A molecular complex consisting of cellulose and two proteins , SP85 and SP65 , is associated with the inner and middle layers and is required for proper organization of distinct proteins in the outer layer . Here we show that , unlike SP85 and other protein precursors , which are stored in prespore vesicles , SP65 is , like cellulose , synthesized just in time . By tagging the SP65 locus with green ﬂuorescent protein , we ﬁnd that SP65 is delivered to the cell surface via largely distinct vesicles , suggesting that separate delivery of components of the cellulose - SP85 - SP65 complex regulates its formation at the cell surface . In support of previous in vivo studies , recombinant SP65 and SP85 are shown to interact directly . In addition , truncation of SP65 causes a defect of the outer layer permeability barrier as seen previously for SP85 mutants . These observations suggest that assembly of the cellulose - SP85 - SP65 triad at the cell surface is biosynthetically regulated both temporally and spatially and that the complex contributes an essential function to outer layer architecture and function . Cell walls protect cells from osmotic , physical , and predatory stress ( 32 ) . The compositions of walls , which are found sur - rounding many free - living cells , the female gametes of most animals , and the somatic cells of plants , range from almost completely proteinaceous to almost completely polysaccha - ride . An important subclass of cell walls has a core layer con - sisting of cellulose ﬁbrils , as found around somatic cells of vascular plants ; green algae ; certain oomycetes and the water mold Achlya ambisexualis ; and spore or cyst walls of the social soil amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum , the free - living amoebae of the genus Acanthamoeba , the soil amoeba Hartmanella gle - bae , and the amoebae - ﬂagellates Naegleria grubei and Schizo - pyrenus russelli . Much remains to be discovered about the role of proteins in the assembly of cellulose - rich cell walls . Dictyostelium is amoeboid during growth , and the absence of a cell wall allows a phagocytic mode of feeding by wild - type cells . Axenic mutants , frequently used as a laboratory model , rely on constitutive ﬂuid - phase endocytosis for nutrition ( 7 ) . In response to starvation , the amoebae aggregate and form mi - grating slugs that emerge from the soil to form fruiting bodies , which consist of a mass of spores supported aerially by a cel - lular stalk . Walls form de novo around each of the prespore cells as they collectively rise to the top of the fruiting body and around each of the stalk cells ( 32 ) . The spore wall or coat is distinct from the stalk cell wall and consists of three morpho - logical layers . The major and central layer is 200 nm thick and composed of interlaced cellulose ﬁbrils and a Gal / GalNAc polysaccharide ( GPS ) . It is bounded by an outer layer com - posed of proteins that form the major permeability barrier to macromolecules and at the plasma membrane by an inner layer containing SP85 , a novel protein consisting of multiple Cys - rich and mucin - type domains . The known coat protein precursors are synthesized during slug migration and stored with the GPS in prespore vesicles ( PSVs ) . The process of coat formation is ﬁrst evidenced by their exocytosis and is followed by the formation of cellulose ﬁbrils elaborated from transmembrane cellulose synthase com - plexes . The organization of the secreted proteins into morpho - logical layers depends on cellulose ( 37 ) . Analysis of an SP85 disruption strain and the effects of expressing discrete domains of SP85 show that this protein inﬂuences the timing of coat formation as prespore cells rise up the stalk ( 35 ) . SP85 also plays a critical role in outer layer assembly because overex - pression of SP85 domains exerts dominant - negative effects on outer layer morphology ( 17 , 37 ) . Some of these effects depend on SP85’s cellulose binding activity ( 17 , 39 ) and possibly other protein interactions ( 16 ) . SP65 , ﬁrst identiﬁed in a two - dimensional ( 2 - D ) gel pro - teomic analysis of the coat ( 34 ) , was later found to partially copurify with SP85 in urea extracts of spore coats ( 39 ) . SP65 was not incorporated into coats of SP85 mutant spores and was also selectively coimmunoprecipitated from the interspore ma - trix with exogenous SP85 by a mechanism that speciﬁcally involved the C1 domain of SP85 ( 38 ) . These ﬁndings reveal a physiologically signiﬁcant association between SP85 and SP65 but do not show if the interaction is direct . This interaction may mediate some functions of SP85 . This possibility has now been addressed by identifying the SP65 gene ( named cotE ) , examining biochemical properties of the recombinant protein * Corresponding author .

This has revealed that SP65 is expressed after SP85 and other known coat pro - teins , suggesting that interaction with SP85 is under biosyn - thetic regulation . Disruption of the SP65 locus ( cotE ) yields a coat phenotype that partially overlaps with that of SP85 - null spores , supporting the importance of a cellulose - SP85 - SP65 complex for outer layer organization . MATERIALS AND METHODS Cells and cell culture . D . discoideum strains used are listed in Table 1 . Cells were grown axenically in HL - 5 growth medium or in association with Klebsiella aerogenes on SM agar ( 24 ) . Axenically grown cells were induced to develop by centrifugally washing cells in PDF buffer ( 24 ) and plating them on 0 . 45 - (cid:2) m Millipore ﬁlters or by washing them in KP ( 10 mM potassium phosphate , pH 6 . 5 ) and plating them on nonnutrient agar plates . Bacterially grown cells were cen - trifugally washed free of bacteria in KP and deposited on nonnutrient agar plates . Spores were harvested either by picking them with a loop into 0 . 2 % NP - 40 in KP or slapping the inverted agar plate onto a countertop and recovering spores by rinsing the lid with the same buffer . Spores were washed by centrifu - gation ( 10 , 000 g (cid:3) 10 s ) . For pretreatments , spores were resuspended in the solution indicated and then washed in KP by centrifugation . Plating efﬁciency was determined by counting colonies formed by plating a serial dilution , pre - pared in a bacterial suspension , of a known number of spores , determined by counting in a hemacytometer , on SM agar plates . Spore coats were isolated from spores of axenically grown cells by density gradient centrifugation as described previously ( 38 ) . Cloning the SP65 gene . The previously reported peptide sequence VRGNPT CLRNHDGI ( 38 ) was found to be encoded perfectly by a 309 - nucleotide ( nt ) sequence present in a database of random sequences of shotgun - cloned Dictyo - stelium genomic DNA ( gDNA ) available at the time . Primers derived from this nucleotide sequence were used to clone additional gDNA ( unpublished data ) using inverse PCR and linker - mediated PCR ( 20 , 27 , 28 ) . Segments of the new sequences matched other gDNA sequences in the databases . This process was reiterated until a full - length candidate open reading frame ( ORF ) for the protein was obtained and then extended until ORFs corresponding to the presumptive neighboring genes were encountered to ensure that all potential exons were identiﬁed . The predicted coding region was deposited in GenBank as cotE ( AF279135 ) . The coding region was subsequently conﬁrmed by automated gene prediction when sufﬁcient sequence data for the locus were obtained by the Dictyostelium Sequencing Consortium and is referenced as DDB0214991 at www . dictybase . org . Expression of SP65 in vegetative cells . The sequence of processed full - length SP65 , whose N terminus was inferred from Edman degradation analysis of cyanogen bromide ( CNBr ) fragments of SP65 ( 38 ) , was ampliﬁed in a PCR using 65 - CoS1 ( 5 (cid:4) - CG GGATCC AGTTATGATGCATGTTACAATGTAGT ) and 65 - CoAS1 ( 5 (cid:4) - CG GGATCC ATTTGTCAAACCACCTATTGAATTGGCAG ) as primers ( see Fig . 1 and 2 ) , CsCl - puriﬁed strain Ax3 gDNA as template , and a 9 : 1 ratio of Taq and Pfu polymerases . Bold letters indicate BamHI sites used for subsequent cloning . The PCR products were ligated into pCR4TOPO and cloned into POP10 Escherichia coli cells ( Invitrogen ) . The BamHI fragment from a plasmid whose insert had the correct sequence ( pTOPO - SP65 ) was subcloned into the unique BamHI site of the integrating plasmid pVS ( 38 ) , yielding pVSmycSP65 . pVSmycSP65 was electroporated into strain Ax3 , and transformed cells were selected at 10 (cid:2) g / ml and then 120 (cid:2) g / ml G418 ( 38 ) . A high - level expression clone ( HW210 ) was obtained by screening with monoclonal antibody ( MAb ) 9E10 , which recognizes the myc epitope tag . SP65 was puriﬁed by pumping 3 . 8 liters of HL - 5 growth medium , from a cell culture that had achieved stationary phase , onto a 75 - ml column containing SP - Sepharose High - Performance ( Pharmacia ) equilibrated in 50 mM HEPES - NaOH ( pH 7 . 0 ) , and eluting SP65 using a linear gradient of 0 to 1 M NaCl in the same buffer . SP65 eluted from the column as a broad peak at 100 to 200 mM NaCl based on dot blot and Western blot analysis using MAb 9E10 . Fractions were pooled and further puriﬁed on a Superose 12 gel ﬁltration column ( Pharmacia ) equilibrated with 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer , pH 7 . 0 . The protein eluted unexpectedly late as a broad peak , suggesting weak adsorption to the column . Expression of SP85 in vegetative cells . SP85 coding DNA was ampliﬁed from pVSBW9M ( 39 ) using PCR primers SP85 - Sdif ( 5 (cid:4) - AAT GGATCC TCTAGAGG TACCTGATCAATGAAAATTTTAAAAAATTG ) and SP85 - AS ( 5 (cid:4) - AAG GG ATCC GGTTAAAAACCATTGAGATCGTTTACGTCG ) and then cloned into pCR4TOPO . pVSBW9M contains a version of SP85 in which the native signal peptide is replaced by the celA signal peptide , and the myc tag was not included in the construct . The SP85 DNA was excised using BamHI ( bold in the primers ) and cloned into the BglII site of the extrachromosomal vector pJK1 ( 9 ) . Se - quencing showed that 13 of the 17 tetrapeptide repeats of mucin domain 1 were deleted during cloning ; instability has been observed previously for SP85 coding DNA ( 39 ) . A clonal strain of Ax3 which secreted SP85 (cid:5) 13 ( HW219 ) was gen - erated by electroporation with pJK1sp85 (cid:5) 13 . GFP tagging of the SP65 / cotE locus . pVSmycSP65 was modiﬁed by the addi - tion of a green ﬂuorescent protein ( GFP ) ( S65T variant ) coding sequence at the unique SacI site present in the vector immediately past the 3 (cid:4) end of the SP65 coding region . The two successive stop codons of pVSmycSP65 were changed to Ser residues by site - directed mutagenesis ( nt changes are underlined ) using the following sense and antisense primers : 5 (cid:4) - GGTGGTTTGACAAATGGATCCT CATCATCAGAGCTC and 5 (cid:4) - GAGCTCTGATGATGAGGATCCATTTGTC AAACCACC , as previously described ( 17 ) . Coding DNA ( 711 bp ) of GFP was ampliﬁed from pTX - GFP ( generous gift of T . Egelhoff [ 12 ] ) using GFP - SCS ( 5 (cid:4) - GAGCTC TCAGGTTCAGGTAGTAAAGGAGAAGAACTTTTCACTGG AGTTG ) and GFP - SCAS ( 5 (cid:4) - GAGCTC TTATTTGTATAGTTCATCCATGCC ATGTG ) as primers in a PCR as described above . GFP - SCAS includes a stop codon ( underlined ) resulting in a GFP C terminus of ELYK . The PCR product was ligated into pTOPO and veriﬁed for the correct sequence at the OMRF DNA Sequencing Core using an ABI3730 capillary sequencer . The GFP coding insert was excised with SacI ( bold in sequences above ) and ligated into the unique SacI site of pVSmycSP65 to yield pVS ( mycSP65 - GFP ) . This yielded , after the C terminus GLTN of SP65 , GSSSSEL , followed by SGSG from the GFP expression construct , followed by SKGE from the GFP N terminus . The bsr cassette was excised as a ClaI fragment from pbsr519 ( 21 ) and inserted into the unique ClaI site within the G418 resistance cassette of pVS ( mycSP65 - GFP ) . pVSbsr ( mycSP65 - GFP ) was electroporated into strain Ax3 , and transfectants were selected using 10 (cid:2) g / ml Blasticidin S . Clones containing the desired single - crossover insertion event were screened by Western blot analysis of developing plaque scrapes using anti - GFP rabbit Ab ( Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR ) for reactive bands at the expected M r value and were retrieved at a frequency of 10 % . Genetic modiﬁcation was conﬁrmed by PCR analysis ( 38 ) as described in Results . Primer GFP - AS1 ( 5 (cid:4) - AAATTTAAGGGTAAGTTTTCCGTATGTTG CATACC ) hybridizes at the 5 (cid:4) end of the GFP coding region ( see Fig . 2E ) . Interruption of the cotE locus . pTOPO - SP65 was modiﬁed by insertion of the BamHI fragment of pbsr519 ( 21 ) into the BglII site at nt 1306 with reverse orientation . The disruption DNA was excised with BamHI , puriﬁed on an aga - rose gel , recovered using a freeze - squeeze method ( 25 ) , ethyl alcohol precipi - tated , and electroporated into strain Ax3 ( 38 ) . Cells that grew in the presence of 10 (cid:2) g / ml Blasticidin S ( ICN ) were screened for modiﬁcation of the cotE locus using PCR methods , yielding 16 / 22 clones with the desired replacement .

Northern blotting . cotE mRNA was detected by Northern blotting as de - scribed previously ( 1 ) , using a probe generated from pTOPO - SP65 by PCR using 65 - CoS1 and 65 - CoAS1 as primers . Anti - SP65 Abs . A preparation of puriﬁed SP65 was mixed with either RIBI adjuvant ( Ribi ImmunoChem Research , Hamilton , MT ) or Immuneasy adjuvant ( QIAGEN ) and injected into 6 - week - old BALB / c female mice . Preimmune and immune sera were collected and tested by an enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) using puriﬁed SP65 adsorbed to microplate wells . Mouse 2 , initially immunized three times using RIBI adjuvant , followed by two boosts using Immuneasy adjuvant , was the best characterized as a result of its high titer after the Immuneasy boosts . MAb clone 6H6 ( 4A11 ) was selected as a repre - sentative of (cid:7) 36 hybridoma clones which secreted ELISA - and immunoﬂuores - cence - positive Abs . MAb 4A11 is an immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) and was puriﬁed from the medium of cell cultures grown in a CL350 chamber ( Integra ) , using a protein G column . Ascites were induced in other immunized mice after an intraperitoneal injection of pristane . Abs used are listed in Table 1 . SP65 binding assay . Anti - myc tag MAb 9E10 was expressed in cell culture , puriﬁed by protein G afﬁnity chromatography , and coupled to CNBr - activated Sepharose 4B ( Sigma ) . For immunoprecipitation ( IP ) studies , 32 (cid:2) l of a 50 % slurry of 9E10 - Sepharose was diluted with 200 (cid:2) l IP buffer , consisting of 50 mM Tris - acetate , pH 7 . 5 , 0 . 3 M NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mg / ml bovine serum albumin , 0 . 5 % ( vol / vol ) NP - 40 , and protease inhibitors ( 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂu - oride , 10 (cid:2) g / ml aprotinin , 10 (cid:2) g / ml leupeptin ) , and centrifuged at 13 , 000 (cid:3) g for 1 min . The beads were resuspended with ( i ) 50 (cid:2) l of a preparation of SP85 that had been concentrated 10 times from the HL - 5 culture medium of the SP85 expression strain described above using a Vivaspin 2 centrifugal concentrator with a polyethersulfone membrane ( molecular weight cutoff , 30 , 000 ) and 50 (cid:2) l of HL - 5 medium prepared in the same manner , ( ii ) 50 (cid:2) l of mycSP65 prepared in the same fashion and 50 (cid:2) l of HL - 5 , or ( iii ) 50 (cid:2) l of both SP85 and mycSP65 . The mixtures , which were supplemented with protease inhibitors , were incubated for 3 h at 4°C , with maintenance of the beads in suspension on a Vortex Genie 2 . The supernatant was removed by centrifugation , and the beads were washed twice with 1 ml IP wash buffer ( IP buffer lacking bovine serum albumin ) . The beads and supernatants were analyzed by Western blotting . Immunoﬂuorescence . Culminants were scraped from nonnutrient agar plates , resuspended in 25 mM EDTA in 10 mM KP ( pH 6 . 5 ) , dissociated by pipetting at room temperature , deposited on coverslips freshly precoated with 1 - mg / ml poly - L - lysine in H 2 O , and allowed to dry . After 5 to 10 min , unbound cells were washed off with KP buffer . The coverslip was dipped in (cid:6) 20°C methanol for 30 min , air dried , hydrated in 5 % nonfat dried milk in TBS ( 20 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 4 , 150 mM NaCl ) for 30 min , incubated in primary Ab fo r 1 h at22°C , washed ﬁve times over 10 min with TBS , incubated in secondary Ab for 1 h , and washed again as before . Coverslips were mounted onto slides in Vectashield ( Vector Labs ) with DAPI ( 4 (cid:4) , 6 (cid:4) - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ) and sealed with ﬁngernail polish . Rabbit anti - GFP ( 1 : 1 , 000 ) was from Molecular Probes , and afﬁnity - puriﬁed Texas Red - conjugated goat anti - rabbit Ab ( 1 : 100 ) and afﬁnity - puriﬁed ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) - conjugated goat anti - mouse Ab ( 1 : 100 ) were from Jackson Laboratories . Epiﬂuorescence images were collected through a 60 (cid:3) - numerical - aperture 1 . 2 water - immersion Nikon lens mounted on a Nikon Eclipse TE2000 microscope via an ORCA charge - coupled device digital camera using Improvision OpenLab software and processed in Photoshop . Lectin incubation of spores . Spores from axenically grown cells were processed and examined using 4 - (cid:2) g / ml FITC - conjugated Ricinus communis agglutinin I ( 120 ) essentially as described previously ( 30 ) . Nucleotide sequence accession number . The predicted coding region was de - posited in GenBank as cotE ( AF279135 ) . The coding region was subsequently conﬁrmed by automated gene prediction when sufﬁcient sequence data for the locus were obtained by the Dictyostelium Sequencing Consortium and is refer - enced as DDB0214991 at www . dictybase . org . RESULTS Cloning the SP65 gene . SP65 was originally identiﬁed as a Coomassie blue - and silver - stained protein in 1 - D and 2 - D sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) - polyacrylamide gels of highly puriﬁed spore coats ( 34 ) . The protein was puriﬁed in dena - tured form from coats by column chromatography and SDS - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( PAGE ) ( 39 ) and cleaved with CNBr . Two major fragments were recovered by SDS - PAGE , and N - terminal sequence data were obtained by Edman degradation ( 38 ) . A full - length ORF that encoded these peptide sequences was obtained by a combination of PCR from gDNA and sequence data from the Dictyostelium genomic databases available at the time . The predicted coding region ( Fig . 1 ) lacks introns and was deposited in GenBank as cotE ( AF279135 ) . As is typical for Dictyostelium coding DNA ( 27 , 28 ) , this ORF has a higher GC content than does ﬂanking DNA and exhibits a favorable Kozak context for the predicted start codon and a candidate polyadenylation signal after the stop codon . The predicted protein contains a single internal Met residue , consistent with the generation of only two bands after treatment with CNBr . Their Edman degradation - derived sequences are highlighted in bold in Fig . 1 . The cotE / SP65 coding region was subsequently identiﬁed by automated gene prediction when sufﬁcient sequence data were obtained by the Dictyostelium Sequencing Consortium and is assigned as DDB0214991 at www . dictybase . org . No expressed sequence tags ( ESTs ) are reported for this sequence in cDNA libraries prepared from slug cells ( 26 ; www . dictybase . org ) . This was initially surprising because known spore coat proteins ac - cumulate in prespore cells of the slug , and their mRNAs are abundantly expressed ( 29 ) and highly represented in the cDNA libraries . However , two EST clones in a cDNA library from culminating cells matched this locus , suggesting that cotE may be expressed unusually late in development . The EST se - quences suggest possible transcription start and stop sites as highlighted in brown in Fig . 1 . cotE lies on chromosome 2 , the location of all but one of the known coat protein genes , and is predicted to encode a 464 - amino - acid protein . A signal peptide - like sequence is removed after Ala17 based on the Edman degradation sequence data ( Fig . 1 ) , yielding a predicted protein with a calculated M r of 45 , 363 that is substantially smaller than the apparent M r of 65 , 000 based on SDS - PAGE . The occurrence of two N - glyco - sylation sequons ( N * in Fig . 1 ) suggests that the apparent M r difference may be explained in part by N - glycosylation of the native protein . The encoded protein has a predicted pI of 7 . 6 compared to the pI range of 7 . 0 to 7 . 2 observed by 2 - D gel electrophoresis ( 34 ) , and the difference might be due to an acidic posttranslational modiﬁcation as suggested by the charge stutter seen in the 2 - D gels . The predicted protein sequence contains motifs ( Fig . 2B ) characteristic of known spore coat proteins ( 34 ) . The N - terminal half is composed of ﬁve Cys - rich C4C motifs ( high - lighted in yellow in Fig . 1 ) , each resembling the N - terminal subdomain of the EGF motif , followed by a Cys - rich C2C motif ( green ) and a Cys - rich CC motif ( pink ) . The even number of Cys residues is consistent with each participating in an intramolecular disulﬁde bond . The C - terminal half , devoid of Cys residues , consists of 12 mucin - like motifs of 16 residues each ( light gray ) , which are potential targets of extensive O - glycosylation ( 6 , 30 ) that may , in addition to N - glycosylation , contribute to the difference between the predicted and apparent M r values . Expression of SP65 mRNA . Northern blot analysis was per - formed to determine the time course of expression of cotE in developing cells collected every 2 h until fruiting bodies formed at 24 h . A nearly full - length probe against cotE detected a V OL . 6 , 2007 NOVEL SPORE COAT PROTEIN PRECURSOR IN DICTYOSTELIUM 1139 on S ep t e m be r 9 , 2013 b y R ed de B i b li o t e c a s de l C S I C h tt p : / / e c . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m major band migrating at 1 . 5 kb ( Fig . 3 ) , consistent with the predicted length of the cotE mRNA , 1 , 550 nt ( Fig . 1 ) , and a slowly migrating minor species whose signiﬁcance is not known . These bands were ﬁrst detected at 22 h , coincident with the latest known prespore marker , spiA ( 22 ) , and consistent with the EST data ( discussed above ) . In contrast , most coat proteins are expressed starting at around 12 h of development ( 5 ) , coordinated with the plasma membrane protein PsA / SP29 ( Fig . 3 ) . The MADS box transcription factor SrfA is required for expression of genes at late developmental stages and for spore coat stability ( 1 – 3 ) . Examination of cotE expression in an srfA - null strain shows that , as for pspA but unlike spiA , cotE expression does not depend on this MADS box transcription factor ( 1 ) . CAT FIG . 1 .

SP65 is normally covalently associated with other proteins in the coat and is therefore difﬁcult to recover in native pure form for biochemical studies and raising speciﬁc Abs . To obtain a pure preparation of SP65 without having to resort to denaturation , SP65 was recombinantly expressed as a secreted protein . The full - length coding region of processed SP65 , beginning with Ser18 , was cloned into pVS ( Fig . 2C ) , an expression plasmid FIG . 1— Continued . FIG . 2 .

The ex - pressed protein was designed to contain an N - terminal cleav - able signal peptide from the celA gene and a c - myc epitope tag which becomes exposed as the new N terminus after processing of the signal peptide . Recombinant SP65 ( mycSP65 ) was puriﬁed from the HL - 5 growth medium of cells transformed with pVSmycSP65 on an SP cation - exchange column . SDS - PAGE analysis revealed a Coomassie blue - stained protein product with an apparent M r of 66 , 000 ( Fig . 4 , lane a ) , and Western blot analysis showed that this band was reactive with MAb 9E10 as expected for the c - myc - tagged protein ( lane d ) . SP65 from spores migrates slightly behind the 66 , 000 - M r standard ( 38 ) , indicating that mycSP65 produced in the growing cells is not modiﬁed in exactly the same manner . Secreted mycSP65 was susceptible to fragmentation . mycSP65 was further puriﬁed by gel ﬁltration and injected into ﬁve mice . Sera were collected , and either ascites were induced or spleens were harvested to create hybridomas for production of MAbs . An ELISA based on the immunogen preparation indicated that reactive Abs were strongly induced ( data not shown ) . Mouse 2 ascites ( M2asc ) was reactive against mycSP65 and its putative fragmentation products ( Fig . 4 , lanes b and c ) , including a major band at 50 , 000 M r that was not recognized by MAb 9E10 and presumably represents an inter - nal or C - terminal fragment of SP65 . None of the many dozens of hybridoma supernatants from fusions of spleens from three mice , immunized according to distinct protocols , were repro - ducibly reactive in Western blot assays ( data not shown ) . As described below , a representative MAb , 4A11 , was speciﬁc for SP65 based on immunoﬂuorescence , suggesting that it recog - nizes a conformational epitope that is affected by denaturation and / or disulﬁde bond reduction ( data not shown ) . Although the ascites and antisera are probably also directed primarily toward conformational epitopes , they were more useful in Western blot assays , presumably because the multiplicity of reactivities permitted recognition of occasional epitopes that might renature after Western blotting . Alternatively , the pro - cess of creating hybridomas may not have captured the full spectrum of speciﬁcities present in the pool of serum IgG . Tagging the SP65 / cotE locus with GFP . Since the Abs were either not reactive with or monospeciﬁc for SP65 in Western blot assays ( see below ) , a GFP gene - tagging method was em - ployed to detect the cotE gene product . A previously described single - crossover strategy ( 8 ) was employed to replace the 3 (cid:4) end of cotE , starting just upstream of the stop codon , with DNA encoding a hydrophilic spacer and GFP , followed by the actin 8 terminator and a Blasticidin S resistance ( bsr ) cassette ( Fig . 2E ) . This insertion was expected to result in expression of SP65 - GFP at the same level and developmental timing as those of SP65 in normal cells . Two ( strains HW211 and HW212 ) of 21 Blasticidin - resistant clones expressed a protein reactive with anti - GFP at an M r position expected for SP65 - GFP ( see be - low ) . This protein was not labeled with MAb 9E10 against the myc epitope , as would be expected if the crossover event oc - curred within the homologous coding region , downstream of the N - terminal myc coding DNA of the plasmid . These clones were examined by PCR for evidence of the desired genetic modiﬁcation . A PCR using a forward primer from 5 (cid:4) SP65 DNA not present in the targeting vector ( 65 - Pr1 ) and a reverse primer from the 5 (cid:4) end of the GFP coding region ( GFP - AS1 ) ( Fig . 1 and 2 ) yielded the expected 1 . 5 - kb DNA product from HW211 and HW212 DNA ( Fig . 5C ) and no products from the parental Ax3 strain DNA . In addition , a PCR using a forward primer from the interior of the coding region ( 65 - CoS2 ) and a second primer from the 3 (cid:4) untranslated region ( 65 - NCAS1 ) yielded the expected 0 . 8 - kb product from parental DNA but not from HW211 , consistent with the replacement of this part of the gene by the GFP fragment ( Fig . 5D ) . Another reaction showed the 5 (cid:4) end of the coding region to be intact ( Fig . 5A ) . FIG . 4 . Recombinant expression of SP65 in growing cells . The HL - 5 medium from strain HW210 cells expressing mycSP65 under control of the discoidin promoter ( Fig . 2C ) was puriﬁed over an SP cation - exchange column and analyzed by SDS - PAGE and Western blotting . Lane a , 100 (cid:2) l , gel stained with Coomassie blue ; lane b , 50 (cid:2) l , Western blot probed with anti - SP65 ( mouse 2 ascites ) ; lane c , like lane b , 100 (cid:2) l ; lane d , 100 (cid:2) l , Western blot probed with anti - myc ( MAb 9E10 ) .

Strains Ax3 ( nor - mal ) and srfA (cid:6) were grown axenically and developed on ﬁlters for the indicated number of hours . Cells were scraped , and equal numbers of cells were extracted and subjected to Northern blot analysis using a full - length SP65 probe . A parallel blot was probed for expression of spiA and pspA . 1142 METCALF ET AL . E UKARYOT .

To study the function of SP65 , the cotE locus was modiﬁed by insertion of the bsr cassette within the coding region using a double - cross - over strategy based on homologous recombination ( Fig . 2D ) . Modiﬁed strains were identiﬁed based on PCR ampliﬁcation of an expected 1 . 0 - kb band from the DNA of clonal strains using primers 65 - Pr1 , located upstream of the gene targeting DNA , and bsr - S1 ( Fig . 1 and 2 ) . An example comparing strains HW207 and Ax3 is shown ( Fig . 5B ) . In addition , ampliﬁcation products starting from the 5 (cid:4) end of the gene ( Fig . 5A ) or from the 3 (cid:4) end of the gene ( Fig . 5D ) were 1 . 4 kb larger in size as expected due to the insertion . Both SP65 - GFP and cotE - bsr strains developed to form normal - appearing fruiting bodies with elongate spores ( see Fig . 11 below ) . Since the bsr cassette of the targeting DNA was in reverse orientation relative to cotE sequences , its transcription terminator may also termi - nate a truncated SP65 mRNA encoding most of the Cys - rich N - terminal half of SP65 ( Fig . 2 ) , up to R235 ( Fig . 1 ) followed by SKLVFGSALSF - tga ( stop ) from the bsr cassette . This pro - tein would have an M r of 25 , 672 and a pI of 7 . 6 . Expression of SP65 in spores . To conﬁrm that SP65 resides in the spore coat , spores , spore coats , and interspore matrix ( the viscous ﬂuid that accumulates between spores in the sorus ) were analyzed by Western blotting . Samples from the normal strain Ax3 and the mutant cotE - modiﬁed strains and from cells grown on bacteria or axenically were compared . The blots shown were probed with serum from mouse 2 , bleed 5 ( M2Bl5 ) , but the results were conﬁrmed with sera and ascites from other mice ( data not shown ) . As shown in Fig . 6A , lane a , M2Bl5 bound to a band in whole spores developed from bacterially grown normal ( Ax3 ) cells at an M r of 65 , 000 , cor - responding to the expected position of SP65 , and a second band at an M r of 85 , 000 . This band is SP85 , as it was absent from the SP85 - null strain HW70 ( 38 ) ( Fig . 6C , lanes b and d ) . The reason for cross - reaction with SP85 may be related to C4C sequence motifs or posttranslational modiﬁcations such as O glycosylation shared between recombinant SP65 and SP85 . SP65 and SP85 were only barely detected in the interspore matrix , as expected ( 38 ) . Similar results were obtained using spores from axenically grown Ax3 cells , except that the SP65 band ( SP65a ) migrated heterodispersely with an apparent M r centered at 55 , 000 ( lane c ) . The difference may be due to proteolysis in axenically grown cells ( see below ) . Analysis of bacterially grown SP65 - GFP spores ( strain HW211 ) showed that the 65 , 000 - M r band was replaced by a band at an apparent M r of 95 , 000 ( lane e ) , as expected owing to the additional mass of GFP ( 26 , 700 ) . The new 95 , 000 - M r band was uniquely labeled with anti - GFP Ab ( Fig . 6B , lane e ) , conﬁrming its identity as the fusion protein . Band a at M r position 47 , 000 represents a nonspeciﬁc reaction of anti - GFP to an unknown spore protein . Like SP65 , SP65 - GFP was asso - ciated with the spore rather than the interspore matrix ( com - pare lanes f and e ) . A similar ﬁnding was observed in axenically grown cells , except that the majority of SP65 - GFP was appar - ently cleaved near the junction of SP65 and GFP , with SP65 being retained with the coat and GFP accumulating in the interspore matrix ( compare lanes g and h in Fig . 6A and B ) . FIG . 5 . Genetic modiﬁcation of the cotE locus . DNA from strains Ax3 , HW207 ( cotE - bsr ) , and HW211 ( cotE - GFP ) was subjected to PCR in the presence of the primer pairs 65 - PrS1 / 65 - CoAS2 ( A ) , 65 - PrS1 / bsr - S1 ( B ) , 65 - PrS1 / GFP - AS1 ( C ) , and 65 - CoS2 / 65 - NCAS1 ( D ) ( Fig . 1 and 2 show primer locations ) . Reaction products were separated on a 1 . 2 % agarose gel containing ethidium bromide . Ex - pected band sizes and M r standard sizes in kb are indicated . HW211 and HW212 DNA yielded similar results ( not shown ) . FIG . 6 . Expression of SP65 in spores and interspore matrix . Bac - terially or axenically grown normal ( Ax3 ) or cotE mutant ( HW207 ) cells were developed to form fruiting bodies . ( A to C ) Sori from 48 - h cultures were separated into spores ( Sp ) and interspore matrix ( ISM ) by centrifugation . ( D ) Spore coats ( SC ) were isolated from lysed axenic spores by density gradient puriﬁcation . Equivalent proportions of each fraction , corresponding to 5 (cid:3) 10 5 spores , were analyzed by Western blotting . Blots were probed with Abs as indicated . Lanes within the same panel are from the same Western blot . Relative mo - lecular weights are given in thousands .

Analysis of the cotE - bsr strain ( HW207 ) conﬁrmed the ab - sence of SP65 at the 65 , 000 - M r position ( Fig . 6A , lane k ) . However , the mutant spores accumulated a new reactive band at an apparent M r of 28 , 000 ( SP65N1 ) , corresponding to the protein expected if a cotE message truncated at the bsr inser - tion site were formed and translated ( see above ) . This protein , concluded to represent the N - terminal half of SP65 ( Fig . 2B ) , also appeared in spores from bacterially grown cells ( data not shown ) but is not evident in lane i because of underloading . The N - terminal half of SP65 , comprised of C4C repeats , con - tains the information required for insertion into the coat , as it is not observed in the interspore matrix ( lane l ) . Examination of SP85 mutant cells ( HW70 or 85 (cid:6) ) shows that , in contrast to Ax3 , SP65 accumulates in the interspore matrix rather than the spore ( Fig . 6C ) . This distribution , ob - served previously using Coomassie blue staining ( 38 ) , conﬁrms that SP65 depends on SP85 for incorporation into the coat . To determine if SP65 is present in the spore coat , equal numbers of spores and puriﬁed spore coats were compared by Western blotting . Fig . 6D ( lanes a and b ) shows similar levels of SP65 in the two fractions , indicating that the majority of spore SP65 is in the coat . Lanes c and d show a similar distri - bution for two known coat proteins , SP96 and SP75 , and serve as a loading control . Developmental regulation of expression of the SP65 protein . Western blot analysis was used to determine when SP65 accu - mulated during development . Probing of SP65 - GFP in strain HW211 , using anti - GFP , showed that the cotE gene product ﬁrst accumulates at 20 h , which is the time at which the pre - spore mass rises up the forming stalk in this strain ( Fig . 7E ) . This is similar to the time of accumulation of SpiA ( Fig . 7D ) and corresponds to the late expression of cotE and spiA mRNA ( Fig . 3 ) . In contrast , other known coat proteins including SP96 , SP85 , and SP75 begin to accumulate much earlier at 10 h ( Fig . 7A to C ) , as described previously ( 5 ) . Probing of SP65 expres - sion in strain Ax3 using anti - SP65 suggests that SP65 does not accumulate until even later than SP65 - GFP ( Fig . 7F ) . The discrepancy may be due to a change in Ab recognition , which apparently depends on conformation , or instability of free SP65 in these axenically grown cells ( see above ) . A later time of accumulation was also observed for truncated SP65N1 ( M r of 28 , 000 ) in the cotE - bsr disruption strain ( Fig . 7G ) . These results show that SP65 is expressed at or just prior to spore coat formation , which occurs at 19 to 21 h under these conditions . Localization of SP65 in the spore coat . A microscopic anal - ysis was conducted to conﬁrm the biochemical evidence that SP65 resides in the spore coat . SP65 - GFP was localized ini - tially based on the intrinsic ﬂuorescence of GFP . Cells in the process of forming coats were obtained by squashing 20 - h HW211 culminants between a coverslip and a slide . Spores , evident by their ellipsoid shape and phase brightness in phase - contrast microscopy , were outlined by green ﬂuorescence ( Fig . 8A ) . Since normal Ax3 spores were not ﬂuorescent ( data not shown ) , this indicated that SP65 - GFP is at the spore surface . In addition , some nonspore cells were also GFP positive ( see asterisks ) , indicating that SP65 appears at the prespore surface prior to the ﬁnal steps of sporulation . When the cellulose layer of the coat was revealed using the ﬂuorescent brightener Cal - coﬂuor White ST , spores with cellulose ( blue ) also ﬂuoresced green , conﬁrming localization of SP65 - GFP in the coat ( Fig . 8B ) . Some cells had surface GFP ﬂuorescence but no Cal - coﬂuor ﬂuorescence ( see asterisks ) , consistent with deposition of SP65 at the cell surface prior to cellulose . Examination of differentiating stalk cells showed only minimal association of SP65 - GFP with stalk cell walls ( Fig . 8C ) . Western blot analysis revealed little degradation of SP65 - GFP at this early stage of sporulation ( data not shown ) , and even if the fusion protein were cleaved , free GFP accumulates in the interspore matrix rather than the spore coat ( Fig . 6 ) . Similar , albeit more intense , spore surface ﬂuorescence was observed in spores from bacte - rially grown cells ( data not shown ) . Localization of SP65 in differentiating prespore cells . SP65 - GFP ﬂuorescence was rarely visualized intracellularly . Since GFP ﬂuorescence might be delayed following biosynthesis , GFP was localized immunocytochemically using an anti - GFP Ab . Labeling was ﬁrst seen in occasional HW211 cells dissociated at 17 . 5 h ( Fig . 9A , asterisk ) . Intracellular labeling appeared speciﬁc for SP65 - GFP because it largely coincided with labeling by MAb 4A11 , FIG . 7 . Time course of SP65 protein expression . Normal and mu - tant strains were grown axenically and developed on ﬁlters for the indicated number of hours . Equal numbers of cells plated were sub - jected to SDS - PAGE and Western blot analysis for developmentally regulated proteins using the indicated Abs . Note that the strains used in this analysis culminate at 19 to 20 h , in contrast to the strain analyzed by Northern blotting in Fig . 3 , which culminate at 22 to 24 h . 1144 METCALF ET AL .

Anti - GFP did not label normal Ax3 cells ( not shown ) , indicating speciﬁc binding to SP65 - GFP . MAb 4A11 did not label 15 - h normal Ax3 and cotE - bsr ( expressing SP65N1 ) cells but la - beled 17 . 5 - h cells in a pattern similar to that of HW211 cells ( data not shown ) . In these examples , intracellular labeling was concen - trated in a central region reminiscent of the Golgi apparatus ( 31 ) . By 19 h , when spores ﬁrst appear , anti - GFP and MAb 4A11 labeled a larger fraction of cells with a similar intracellular pattern ( Fig . 9B ) . Strong labeling of spores with anti - GFP indicates that the GFP domain is exposed at the spore surface . In contrast , MAb 4A11 did not label spores , indicating that the SP65 epitope is either inaccessible , as occurs for other coat proteins including SP85 ( see below ) , or lost due to a conformational change . To - gether , these data suggest that anti - GFP is a valid reporter of SP65 expression and that an intracellular pool of SP65 - GFP brieﬂy accumulates prior to export to the cell surface . To compare localization of SP65 with SP85 , HW211 cells were double probed with anti - GFP and either MAb 5F5 ( data not shown ) or MAb 16 . 1 to detect SP85 ( 17 ) . At 17 . 5 h , there was frequent expression of SP85 , which is expressed earlier and accumulates in PSVs coordinately with other known coat pro - teins , and rare expression of SP65 ( Fig . 9C ) . By 18 . 5 h , SP65 - GFP was expressed in many cells in vesicle - like structures that are almost completely distinct from SP85 - positive vesicles ( PSVs ) , so only the merged panel is shown ( Fig . 9D ) . This image was particularly well ﬂattened by the coverslip , allowing visualization of the typical annular proﬁle of PSVs ( 38 ) . SP65 - GFP - containing vesicles tended to be smaller than PSVs , though some were annular and a few were superimposed upon PSVs . These structures are reminiscent of the non - PSV class of vesicles populated by an expressed C - terminal fragment of SP85 ( 38 ) . In Fig . 9E , cells from sorogens at 19 . 5 h were classiﬁed according to their labeling patterns with the two Abs ( numbers correspond to Fig . 9E [ merge ] ) : ( i ) cells with intra - cellular PSV labeling for SP85 but little anti - GFP labeling , consistent with onset of SP85 expression prior to that of SP65 ; ( ii ) cells labeling intracellularly for both SP85 and GFP in largely separate patterns , suggesting that SP65 initially ac - cumulates in vesicles distinct from PSVs ; ( iii ) cells that were FIG . 8 .

It is likely that following initial expression in the Golgi appara - tus , SP65 is transported rapidly to the cell periphery in non - PSVs , which either fuse with or coordinately exocytose with PSVs to form initial cell surface crescents representing sites of nascent coat assembly .

The previously observed inter - action between SP65 and SP85 ( 38 ) was detected in the inter - spore matrix and coat extracts . To determine if the interaction occurs independently of other coat factors , mycSP65 ( Fig . 4 ) and (cid:5) SP85 ( lacking 13 mucin repeats ) were expressed recom - binantly in the HL - 5 growth medium of growing cells , which lacks other coat components including the polysaccharides . MAb 9E10 - Sepharose preferentially pulled down an apparent 16 , 000 - M r N - terminal fragment of mycSP65 ( mycSP65N2 ) from concentrated HL - 5 containing mycSP65 ( Fig . 10 ) . mycSP65N2 is probably a degradation product that includes most or all of its ﬁve Cys - rich C4C domains ( 155 amino acids ) . Though in the absence of mycSP65 the beads nonspeciﬁcally pulled down a small amount of (cid:5) SP85 , the amount was greatly increased if mycSP65 was present . This suggests that the Cys - rich N terminus of SP65 interacts directly with SP85 , previously shown to involve its own Cys - rich C1 domain . SP65 mutant coats are hyperpermeable . Genetic deletion of most coat proteins allows increased labeling of spores by the ﬂuorescent lectin FITC - Ricinus communis agglutinin I ( RCA - I ) ( 32 ) , suggesting a breakdown of the outer layer barrier that nor - mally masks the lectin’s target , the GPS residing in the inner and middle layers . Here , spores from the cotE - bsr strain HW207 are labeled with FITC – RCA - I more intensely than normal spores ( Fig . 11 ) . Preextraction of the spores with urea resulted in similar levels of ﬂuorescence between spore types , suggesting that the difference was not due to altered levels of GPS itself . To test if the permeability difference affected spore resistance to stress , 2 - day - old spores from bacterially or axenically grown strains Ax3 , HW207 ( SP65N1 ) , and HW211 ( SP65 - GFP ) were incubated for 45 min in 6 M urea in KP at 22°C or 0 . 5 % SDS in KP at 22°C , 42°C , 62°C , or 100°C . All spores showed normal and similar via - bility except at the elevated temperatures ( data not shown ) , which were similarly lethal for all three strains ( 1 % plating efﬁciency at 42°C and (cid:8) 0 . 1 % at higher temperatures ) . This indicated that the mutant spore coats still provided protection to the enclosed cell . DISCUSSION SP65 is conﬁrmed here to be selectively if not exclusively associated with the spore coat , making SP65 one of 10 vali - dated proteins characteristic of this cell wall type . However , SP65 is not synthesized and stored in PSVs with the other nine ( 32 ) but rather is formed and routed to the cell surface just FIG . 10 . Binding of SP85 to SP65 . MAb 9E10 ( anti - myc ) beads were incubated with concentrated HL - 5 growth medium from cells expressing mycSP65 or (cid:5) SP85 , or a mixture of the two . After 3 h , the beads were centrifuged and washed . One equivalent of the ﬁrst super - natant fraction ( nonbound ) and a half - equivalent of the washed bead fraction ( bound ) were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and Western blotting for the presence of SP65 using MAb 9E10 or (cid:5) SP85 using MAb 5F5 , whose positions are marked in the margin . mycSP65N2 ( M r , (cid:9) 16 , 000 ) was the predominant isoform of mycSP65 present in the conditioned medium ( Fig . 4 ) that bound to the MAb 9E10 beads . FIG . 11 . Lectin labeling of spores . Spores from axenically grown cells were treated with ( B ) or without ( A ) hot 6 M urea in KP buffer , washed , and incubated in 4 - (cid:2) g / ml FITC - conjugated Ricinus communis agglutinin I ( 120 ) ( RCA - I ) to label the GPS of the coat interior .

The novel timing and routing of SP65 suggest that the interaction of SP65 with cellulose , via the intermediate PSV protein SP85 , may critically regulate coat assembly . The conclusion that SP65 is a coat protein is based in part on use of Abs generated against recombinant full - length mycSP65 . Polyclonal Abs showed that SP65 is enriched in coats of spores based on Western blotting ( Fig . 6 ) , but their polyspeciﬁcity pre - cluded their use in microscopy for conﬁrmation . The MAbs , which recognize conformational epitopes , did not bind spore coats ( Fig . 9B ) , probably because the epitopes were either masked or altered in coats . For similar reasons , DP87 / SP75 and EB4 / SP35 gene products were originally identiﬁed as interspore matrix proteins before other approaches identiﬁed them as coat proteins ( 32 ) . Therefore , tagging the SP65 / cotE locus with GFP to yield an SP65 - GFP fusion protein was particularly informative . Intrinsic GFP ﬂuorescence and anti - GFP Ab labeling are ob - served only at the surface of spores and not in slugs or in stalk cells ( Fig . 8 and 9C to E ) . Functional evidence for coat localiza - tion emerged from the ﬁnding that truncation of SP65 rendered the coat permeable to an exogenous macromolecular tracer ( Fig . 11 ) . Western blotting showed that SP65 - GFP is not expressed until within an hour of coat formation ( Fig . 7 ) , and this was corroborated by immunoﬂuorescence using anti - GFP and MAb 4A11 ( Fig . 9A and B ) . Analysis of native SP65 conﬁrmed the late timing , but the strong bias of the Abs toward confor - mational epitopes , masking of the epitopes in the coat , and apparent ongoing processing including degradation thwarted precise characterization of SP65 expression in the absence of the GFP tag . Protein expression was closely linked to message accumulation as determined by Northern blotting ( Fig . 3 ) , indicating that SP65 expression is under transcriptional con - trol . The timing is essentially identical to that of the previously described prespore - cell - speciﬁc , glycosylphosphatidylinositol - anchored protein SpiA , associated with the plasma membrane that is tightly bound to the coat . The transport pathway and function of SpiA are unknown ( 22 ) . Recently , additional late genes have been found to be expressed under the control of the GATA - type transcriptional factor StkA ( 14 ) or the MADS - box - type transcriptional factor SrfA ( 1 , 2 ) . SigD , regulated by SrfA , has amino acid sequence motifs found in other coat proteins and is a candidate for another coat protein with sim - ilar regulation . Unlike SigD and SpiA , however , SP65 does not depend on SrfA ( Fig . 3 ) . The intracellular localization of the SP65 precursor is dis - tinctive from that of known coat proteins . SP65 - GFP was ﬁrst detected in a central location ( Fig . 9A and C ) suggestive of the Golgi apparatus ( 31 ) and conﬁrmed using MAb 4A11 for na - tive SP65 . Subsequently , anti - GFP labeling was distributed in a dispersed punctate manner consistent with vesicles . But dou - ble - labeling experiments showed that these are not equivalent to PSVs ( Fig . 9D and E , number 2 ) , where other coat protein precursors and the GPS accumulate ( 32 ) . However , overlap of SP65 and SP85 was occasionally observed ( Fig . 9E , number 3 ) , but it is not clear whether this reﬂects rare vesicle fusion or a temporal progression in which SP65 and SP85 vesicles fuse transiently close to the time of exocytosis consistent with evi - dence that PSVs undergo continual maturation ( 23 ) . GFP ﬂu - orescence could not be used to dynamically track nascent SP65 - GFP because vesicular GFP was rarely ﬂuorescent . Flu - orescence acquisition by GFP depends on time and O 2 ( 36 ) , whose level in vesicles may be limiting . Initial formation of the coat was evidenced by a ﬂuorescent crescent at the cell surface . This arc was usually labeled for both SP65 - GFP and SP85 , which is most consistent with coordinate rather than sequential secretion of the two proteins . Distinct secretory trajectories for discrete cell wall precursors have been observed in other cell systems , though this is most often associated with sequentially deposited wall layers ( 11 , 15 , 18 ) . When cellulose is imaged using Calcoﬂuor , the presence of cells ﬂuorescent for GFP but not Calcoﬂuor ( Fig . 8B ) suggests that SP65 is secreted to the cell surface before cellulose is deposited . The dynamic properties of SP65 , revealed by changes in Ab binding and M r differences between axenically and bacterially grown cells , are unusual and may reﬂect a combination of natural protein maturation and local microenvironmental dif - ferences between axenically and bacterially derived sorogens . The transient appearance of the MAb 4A11 epitope might be related to global disulﬁde rearrangements ( 34 ) or other post - translational modiﬁcations such as proteolytic processing ( 32 , 39 ) thought to occur during coat assembly . SP65 may be asso - ciated with the outer coat surface because the GFP of SP65 - GFP is accessible at the spore surface based on Ab labeling and is likely exposed to proteases present within the spore coat and the interspore matrix ( 10 , 19 , 32 ) . Indeed , SP65 is suscep - tible to proteolytic degradation when expressed in the growth medium ( Fig . 4 ) . SP65 - GFP was less stable in culminants from axenically grown cells than in culminants from bacterially grown cells , which correlates with the earlier time of encapsu - lation in the rising sorogen from axenically grown cells noted when nascent spores were collected ( data not shown ) . A longer period of turbulent exposure to proteases experienced by the earlier - forming spores might explain the higher degree of breakdown of SP65 and SP65 - GFP . Previous studies suggested that SP85 simultaneously con - tacts cellulose and SP65 to form a structural unit of the coat . Domain mapping studies showed this to be mediated by its 110 - amino - acid C1 domain composed of four Cys - rich C4C motifs related to the N - terminal subdomain of EGF repeats ( 17 , 35 , 38 ) . A direct SP65 - SP85 interaction is conﬁrmed here using recombinant proteins , which rules out a requirement for a coat - speciﬁc intermediary factor such as a coat polysaccha - ride . Interestingly , the in vitro interaction was detected using a spontaneously generated N - terminal fragment of SP65 ( mycSP65N2 ) that was captured by the MAb 9E10 beads used to immunoprecipitate SP65 . This region encompasses the C4C motifs of SP65 . Full - length SP65 normally may fold in such a way that the C - terminal domain masks accessibility of the N terminus ( where the myc epitope is located ) , but an effect of a distinct posttranslational modiﬁcation of the recombinant pro - tein cannot be excluded . Together these results imply a general function for C4C motifs in mediating protein - protein and pro - tein - carbohydrate interactions . This is consistent with the ob - servation that truncated SP65N1 ( generated by the insertion of bsr ) accumulates in the coat rather than the interspore matrix ( Fig . 6 ) . The accumulation of SP65 in the interspore matrix of SP85 / pspB - bsr spores conﬁrms previous ﬁndings that SP85 is required to retain SP65 in the coat in vivo ( 38 ) . 1148 METCALF ET AL .

Though the distinct properties of SP85 mutant spores , which tend to be spherical and to not rise to the top of the stalk ( 35 ) , and SP65 mutant spores , which are more per - meable without urea pretreatment ( compare Fig . 11 and ref - erence 38 ) , suggest that the two proteins contribute separate functions , the comparison is complicated because the SP85 mutation is a null whereas the SP65 mutant produces a poten - tially dominant - negative N - terminal fragment ( SP65N1 ) . Nev - ertheless , the new data suggest that some activities of SP85 may be regulated by the availability of SP65 , which is synthe - sized much later and transported to the cell surface via a largely distinct vesicle population .
