Dorabawila @ health . ny . gov Abstract Background : Though the use of home testing is increasing , it is not represented in the reported coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) metrics . As the epidemic and its tracking evolve , it is critical to understand who the excluded home - tested persons are relative to those in reported metrics . Methods : Five New York State databases were linked to understand the trends in home - tested COVID - 19 cases compared to laboratory - confirmed cases from November 2021 to April 2022 . Frequency distributions , logistic regression adjusted odds ratios ( aOR ) , and 95 % confidence intervals ( CI ) were used to compare the characteristics of home - tested and laboratory - tested persons . Results : Of 592 , 227 confirmed COVID - 19 cases , 71 , 531 ( 12 % ) had a home - test - only , 515 , 001 ( 87 % ) had a laboratory - test - only and 5 , 695 ( 1 % ) had both a home - test and laboratory - test during this period . Home - tested cases , as a percentage of confirmed COVID - 19 cases , increased from 1 % in November 2021 to 22 % in April 2022 . Children aged 5 - 11 years with 3 . 74 aOR ( 95 % CI : 3 . 53 , 3 . 96 ) and adolescents aged 12 - 17 years with 3 . 24 aOR ( 95 % CI : 3 . 07 , 3 . 43 ) were more likely to have home - test - only than adults aged 65 and above . Boosted ( aOR 1 . 87 , 95 % CI : 1 . 82 , 1 . 93 ) , in K - 12 school settings ( aOR 2 . 33 , 95 % CI : 2 . 27 , 2 . 40 ) , or possibly infected by a household member ( aOR 1 . 17 , 95 % CI : 1 . 13 , 1 . 22 ) were more likely to report home - test - only than laboratory - test - only . Individuals hospitalized ( aOR 0 . 04 , 95 % CI : 0 . 03 , 0 . 06 ) , with underlying conditions ( aOR 0 . 85 , 95 % CI : 0 . 83 , 0 . 87 ) , pregnant ( aOR 0 . 76 , 95 % CI : 0 . 66 , 0 . 86 ) , Hispanic ( aOR 0 . 50 : 95 % CI : 0 . 48 , 0 . 53 ) , Asian ( aOR 0 . 31 , 95 % CI : 0 . 28 , 0 . 34 ) , or Black ( aOR 0 . 45 , 95 % CI : 0 . 42 , 047 ) were less likely to utilize the home test only compared to the laboratory test only . Conclusion : The number of individuals using home tests only as a proportion of confirmed COVID - 19 cases continues to increase . Home test - only cases are less likely to be hospitalized and have a lower potential for severe disease as measured by age , vaccination status , and underlying conditions . Thus , those with severe disease and the potential for severe disease are represented as official metrics . Racial and ethnic differences exist between persons reporting home and laboratory tests . .

Introduction The coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) epidemic has persisted , and there is a continued need to monitor its trends . As of September 21 , 2022 , there were almost 6 million COVID - 19 infections and 400 , 000 reinfections in the NYS . At - home rapid COVID - 19 antigen test ( home - test ) availability and usage have increased rapidly in the United States with the emergence of the B . 1 . 2 . 529 ( Omicron ) variant in late 2021 ( 1 - 8 ) . As case volume surged with Omicron in late 2021 and January 2022 , a shortage of laboratory - based diagnostic nucleic acid amplification ( laboratory - based tests ) testing relative to demand resulted in increased home test usage ( 6 ) . A recent national study reported that at - home test usage by those with COVID - 19 - like illness increased from approximately 5 . 7 % during the delta dominant period ( August 23 , 2021 – December 11 , 2021 ) to 20 . 1 % in the Omicron dominant period ( December 19 , 2021 – March 12 , 2022 ) ( 9 ) . Another study reported an increasing trend in home - test use and found that during the week ending on January 8 , 2022 , when testing volume peaked , the positivity rate was 17 . 3 for home tests and 29 . 1 for laboratory - based tests ( 10 ) . Home tests are easily accessible , offer privacy during testing , and provide rapid results compared to laboratory - based tests . Simultaneously , an increase in accessibility was driven by the school , state , and federal government - free test kits , and increased volume in pharmacies and retail venues ( 11 ) . Official reporting , as well as other analytics , are primarily based on laboratory - based testing , as home tests are not typically reported to data systems tracking COVID - 19 case volume and rates . Consequently , there is a dearth of information on home test usage and users ; studies available are very few , survey - based with an associated response bias and are on adults ( 12 , 13 ) . Given this scenario , there is a critical need to better understand the individuals , including children , using and reporting home tests , as well as trends in home tests . Doing so will shed light on the potential bias , if any , in analyses based solely on laboratory testing . This paper explores several questions associated with home tests in NYS , excluding New York City ( NYC ) . First , the trends in at - home tests that were voluntarily reported to local health departments ( phone , email , online ) added to the public health surveillance system relative to laboratory - based testing . Second , we aimed to understand the proportion of persons with at - home and laboratory - based tests . Third , persons who reported at - home tests only were compared to laboratory - based tests only by demographics , K - 12 school - based attendance or workplace , vaccination status , severe disease , symptoms , and knowledge of where exposed ( the source of infection ) . 2 . Materials and Methods 2 . 1 Materials This study is based on five linked NYS databases ( 14 , 15 ) . The primary database for COVID - 19 case investigation in the NYS , outside NYC , is the Communicable Disease Case Management System ( CDCMS ) . The Electronic Clinical Laboratory Reporting System ( ECLRS ) contains all reportable ( positive and negative ) COVID - 19 test results ( nucleic acid amplification test [ NAAT ] or antigen ) in the NYS . Home tests have not been reported to the ECLRS . Applicable information on all positive laboratory tests is automatically transmitted from ECLRS to CDCMS , .

Additionally , Local Health Departments ( LHDs ) can manually enter cases with positive tests ( NAAT or antigen ) that are not reported via ECLRS . These could be at - home tests reported to LHDs or laboratory reports from other jurisdictions . LHDs collect positive home test results via multiple mechanisms . Some have web portals utilized by the public to enter results , some receive results from schools , and other manual mechanisms , such as emails . These were then uploaded to the CDCMS and utilized for case management . To determine vaccine status , cases in the CDCMS were linked to a combined database containing the Citywide Immunization Registry ( CIR ) and the NYS Immunization Information System ( NYSIIS ) COVID - 19 vaccination data for residents of New York City and the rest of the NYS . These databases were linked using deterministic algorithms that matched the name and date of birth ( DOB ) . Finally , the Health Electronic Response Data System ( HERDS ) is a statewide , daily electronic survey of hospitals that reports patients with COVID - 19 hospitalized at inpatient facilities . HERDS reported hospital admissions were linked based on initials , sex , DOB , and patient ZIP code . The period of the analysis started when the home test entry to the CDCMS was more systematic , from November 1 , 2021 , and limited to cases with completed interviews conducted by case investigators . The study period ended on April 30 , 2022 . The primary outcome , COVID - 19 case ( case ) , was defined as a report of a new positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) NAAT or antigen test ( including at - home tests ) result greater than 90 days from the first or previous case from a positive result ( 16 ) . Manually created cases were excluded if the type of test ( laboratory - based or at - home ) was unclear . As not all counties in the NYS investigate at - home tests in CDCMS , the analysis was further restricted to 33 counties that routinely uploaded at - home test results to CDCMS . Trends in reported testing for three mutually exclusive case - testing groups , based on how a case was reported as testing positive , are presented . The testing groups were home - test - only , laboratory - test - only , and both home - test and laboratory - based ( both tests ) . Cases were classified as home - test - only versus laboratory - test - only using the test type available in the CDCMS . Home test cases were linked to ECLRS to identify those with laboratory tests within 7 days ( before , same day , or after ) of the at - home test being further classified as both tests . Fully vaccinated patients were defined as those who were vaccinated 14 days or more after the completion of the primary series . 2 . 2 Methods The analysis provided descriptive statistics ( demographics , geographic locations , K - 12 school - based setting , vaccination status , symptoms , underlying conditions , and known exposure locations ) for each of the three case - testing groups . School setting was based on those who responded that , “within the 2 weeks prior to symptom onset / collection date , ” they did “visit / attend” a “school / university / childcare center . ” Those persons who selected “School ( Prek - 12 ) ” as the type of school or summer camp they visited were classified as “K - 12 School Based . ” Then they were offered a list of their roles in school ( student , staff , faculty , teacher , volunteer , or .

Exposure type was based on a question , “in the past 14 days , have you been in contact with a COVID - 19 Case” and if “yes , ” type of exposures selected from an offered list . Symptoms , based on a list of options offered in the CDCMS , were classified into the following categories : ( a ) gastrointestinal ( abdominal pain , dehydration , diarrhea , vomiting , and nausea ) ; ( b ) back and muscle pain ; ( c ) cold symptoms ( chills , cough , fatigue , fever , headache , runny nose , sore throat ) ; ( d ) cardiac , respiratory , and rigor ( chest pain , difficulty breathing , dyspnea , wheezing , rigor , seizure ) , and ( f ) smell and taste . Exposure type and symptoms are not mutually exclusive categories , and a case can be classified into multiple exposure types and symptom categories given that a person can have multiple exposures and / or symptoms . Severe disease was measured as hospitalizations ( reported to HERDS ) within 14 days of the specimen collection date ( that within 7 days was also examined ) . Adjusted odds ratios ( aOR ) using multivariate logistic regression and 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs ) for aORs were estimated for the following : ( a ) trends adjusted for the month , county , and age category for home - test - only compared to laboratory - test - only and home - test - only compared to both tests ; and ( b ) home - test - only vs . laboratory - test - only further adjusted for race / ethnicity , setting , underlying conditions , pregnancy , exposure source , and symptoms . County was used to adjust for geographic differences , including home test usage , as county practices varied . Adjusting for the reported month accounts for temporal variation in the home test volume , especially with changing variants . Broad age categories ( 0 - 4 years , 5 - 11 years , 12 - 17 years , 18 – 49 , and 50 - 64 years , with over 64 years as the reference ) were used . The reference category for race / ethnicity was white , and that for sex was female . The K - 12 school is based on students , staff , faculty , and volunteers at K - 12 schools , with the reference category of those not belonging to these groups ( non - school - based ) . All analyses were conducted using the Statistical Analysis Software ( SAS 9 . 4 ) . The New York State Department of Health Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) determined that this surveillance activity was necessary for public health work and , therefore , did not require IRB review . 3 . Results 3 . 1 Trend in Home - Tests From November 2021 to April 2022 , there were 592 , 227 confirmed COVID - 19 cases with complete interviews from the 33 LHDs that actively investigated at - home tests in the CDCMS . Of these , 71 , 699 ( 12 % ) were from home - test - only , 515 , 001 ( 87 % ) were from laboratory - tests - only and 5 , 527 ( 1 . 0 % ) had both tests ( Table 1 ) . The percentage of home - test - only cases has increased ( Table 1 , Figure 1 ) from 0 . 7 % in November 2021 to 21 . 6 % in April 2022 . As the percentage of home - test - only tests increased , those with both tests decreased from 12 . 5 % in November 2022 to 4 . 3 % in April 2022 . School - aged children ( aged 5 - 17 years ) had a higher percentage of home test - only responses ( Figure 2 ) . Of those who underwent both tests , 28 . 1 % underwent a laboratory - based test on the same day , and the majority within 7 days after the home test ( 67 . 6 % ) . 3 . 2 Comparison of Home - Testers vs Laboratory - Testers .

The percentage of unvaccinated cases was higher in the laboratory - test - only group ( 46 . 5 % compared to 32 . 0 % for both - tests and 38 . 7 % for home - test - only ) , while cases with a booster dose made up a higher percentage of the at - home test group ( 23 . 6 % and 26 . 4 % , respectively , for home - test - only and both - tests compared to 15 . 3 % for laboratory - test - only ) . Cases reporting working , attending , or volunteering at a K - 12 school were highest among at - home tests only ( 41 . 8 % home - tests - only and 26 . 5 % for both tests compared to 19 . 8 % for laboratory tests only ) . Gastrointestinal ( 13 . 6 % vs . 14 . 7 % ) , cardiac / respiratory / rigor ( 7 . 7 % vs . 11 . 1 % ) , smell / taste ( 6 . 3 % vs . 13 . 0 % ) symptoms , and underlying conditions ( 15 . 0 % vs . 21 . 4 % ) were lower in home - test - only cases than in laboratory - test - only cases . 3 . 3 : Adjusted Trends : Home - Test - Only vs Laboratory - Test - Only Figure 3 shows the aOR and CI trends adjusted for age and county for home - tests - only versus laboratory - tests - only and home - tests - only versus both tests . November was combined with December given the small number of cases in November 2021 , and the figure provides the monthly trend in reference to November and December 2021 . The increasing trend of home tests only was consistent . The odds ratio of home - test - only vs laboratory - tests - only goes from 8 . 11 ( 95 % CI : 7 . 86 , 8 . 35 ) in January 2022 to 14 . 71 ( 95 % CI : 14 . 19 , 15 . 26 ) in April 2022 relative to November / December 2021 . There was a concurrent increase in home - tests - only relative to both tests ( a person with an at - home test having a laboratory - based test within 7 days of the at - home test ) increasing from 1 . 36 ( 95 % CI : 1 . 23 , 1 . 31 ) in January 2022 to 2 . 45 ( 95 % CI : 2 . 17 , 2 . 78 ) in April 2022 relative to November / December 2021 . 3 . 4 : Adjusted Comparison of Home - Test - Only vs Laboratory - Test - Only Figure 4 demonstrates that once adjusted for the month , county , and other variables displayed , differences between home - test - only vs . laboratory - test - only ( observed with descriptive statistics in Table 2 ) persisted and were statistically significant . Boosted persons were most likely to report home tests only ( aOR 1 . 87 , 95 % CI : 1 . 82 , 1 . 93 ) compared to laboratory tests only , followed by those with only a primary series ( aOR 1 . 30 , 95 % CI : 1 . 27 , 1 . 33 ) with unvaccinated as the reference category . The results in the partially vaccinated group were not statistically significant . Those in K - 12 settings were more likely to use home tests only , whereas those in non - K - 12 settings were more likely to use laboratory tests only . The odds ratio for a home - test - only was 2 . 33 ( 95 % CI : 2 . 27 , 2 . 40 ) relative to laboratory - test - only for those in K - 12 settings . When restricted to the school - age ( 5 - 17 years ) population , the odds ratio declines to 1 . 55 ( 95 % CI : 95 % CI : 1 . 46 , 1 . 65 ) ( Table A . 2 ) . In contrast , when restricted to adults ( > 18 years ) only , the odds ratio increases to 2 . 85 ( 95 % CI : 2 . 75 , 2 . 95 ) ( Table A . 3 ) . Laboratory tests only capture severe disease as measured by hospitalization , certain symptoms , and cases with underlying conditions . Hospitalization within 14 days was less likely among home - test - only cases than laboratory - test - only cases , with only 44 home - test - only cases ( aOR 0 . 04 , 95 % CI : 0 . 03 , 0 . 06 ) being hospitalized . The results for hospitalizations within seven days , with only five home - test - only cases with hospitalization , were consistent . Persons with underlying conditions ( aOR 0 . 85 , 95 % CI : 0 . 83 , 0 . 87 ) or who were pregnant ( aOR 0 . 76 , 95 % .

Those with certain symptom groups ( controlled for other symptoms ) were more likely to have a home - test - only with 1 . 11 ( 95 % CI : 1 . 08 , 1 . 13 ) for back and muscle pain and 1 . 43 ( 95 % CI : 1 . 40 , 1 . 47 ) for cold symptoms relative to those without any symptoms reported . For cases with a known exposure , the source of the exposure was associated with the testing group . If known exposure was from a household member ( aOR : 1 . 17 , 95 % CI : 1 . 13 , 1 . 22 ) , then the home - test - only was more likely . In contrast , those with a known exposure to a case in congregate housing ( aOR 0 . 53 , 95 % CI : 0 . 31 , 0 . 90 ) , place of employment ( aOR 0 . 82 , 95 % CI : 0 . 75 , 0 . 91 ) , a healthcare facility ( aOR 0 . 55 , 95 % CI : 0 . 35 , 0 . 87 ) , long term care facility ( aOR 0 . 58 , 95 % CI : 0 . 34 , 1 . 00 ) , or a social event ( aOR 0 . 72 , 95 % CI : 0 . 63 , 0 . 83 ) were less likely to be home - test - only . 4 . Discussion By linking several databases , this study provides valuable insight into trends in home testing and persons excluded from official laboratory - confirmed test - based metrics in New York State ( excluding New York City ) . The strengths of this study include the analysis of tests during the Omicron period with widespread home testing coverage and population - based large sample sizes using case investigation data collected by trained interviewers , as opposed to survey data impacted by response bias . However , testing trends as well as demographic ( age , race ) and vaccination status observed were consistent with survey - based studies ( 9 , 12 , 13 , 17 ) and were able to validate each other . This study demonstrated that certain populations are more likely to use home tests only . Specifically , those at lower risk of severe disease , such as boosted , with certain symptom categories , younger age groups , persons not hospitalized , and those without underlying conditions or special medical needs , are more likely to use home tests only . Racial differences in - home testing with a higher likelihood for Whites and a lower likelihood for Blacks , Asians , Native Americans , and Hispanic may not only reflect testing behavior , but also accessibility , knowledge , and economic differences in testing ( 6 , 18 ) , particularly given the fact that COVID - 19 has disproportionately impacted communities of color ( 19 - 24 ) . While data indicate that non - binary persons are more likely to utilize only home testing , it is difficult to be conclusive given the higher percentage of missing gender among home testers ( 6 . 9 % for home - test - only , 0 . 5 % laboratory - test - only ) and the small number of persons identified as non - binary ( 95 home - test - only , 93 laboratory - test - only ) . Age differentials in home testing were consistent with those in other studies on adults ( 9 ) . The comparison of adults with school - age populations provides additional insight . The higher home - testing likelihood observed for the school - aged population is consistent with a recent study ( 33 ) . This volume may be driven by a sharp rise in cases with Omicron onset . It may have continued with the widespread availability of test kits through the school , requirements by schools to have negative tests if symptomatic , and concerns about transmission risk to other household members ( 11 , 25 ) . When restricted to adults , the higher likelihood of home - tests - only for K - 12 school - based persons indicates that it is not only age , but school setting that also impacts the test choice . .

First , employment testing requirements that may have existed for unvaccinated persons may have contributed ( 26 ) . Second , the potential for more severe disease if unvaccinated persons are positive may result in a higher likelihood of them opting for laboratory - confirmed testing when presenting with symptoms . Third , given the reverse likelihood of boosting , they may have opted for home testing . It has been demonstrated that vaccination reduces severity ( 31 , 32 ) , and further analysis on vaccination , boosters , and severity is warranted . Fourth , individuals who are more conscientious about being vaccinated may be more likely to test at home and report . Hospitalization , certain symptom groups , and underlying condition differentials between the home test - only and laboratory test - only cases indicate that cases captured via official metrics include those with severe disease and potential for severe disease . This indicates that publicly reported metrics capture a high proportion of , if not most , severe diseases and those with the potential for severe disease . The association between the testing type and known exposure was not surprising . Healthcare facilities , congregate housing , and long - term care facilities are all congregate care settings in which laboratory - testing confirmation may be desired by employers and administrators for both staff and residents . While the risk of transmission was higher among household members ( 19 , 12 - 29 ) , the perception that a home test was sufficient may result in those exposed by a household member opting for only home tests . Both the increased availability of home tests via schools and similar perceptions may lead those exposed in daycare or schools to use only home tests . This study has several limitations . First , the analysis was restricted to LHDs who were willing and able to accept home - test reports . Among them , home tests were voluntarily reported , while the comparison group included mandated reporting for laboratory - based cases . The conclusions drawn may be skewed by a person’s willingness to report home - based tests . One would expect those with severe forms of disease to seek care , and healthcare facilities would require laboratory confirmation and as such be included . For example , according to a recent survey , laboratory - confirmed tests had a 14 . 1 % estimated test positivity rate for SARS - CoV - 2 infection compared to 5 . 2 % for exclusive home testers during the period from January 1 to March 16 , 2022 ( 12 ) . Second , negative home test results have not been reported for CDCMS . However , while negative laboratory - confirmed tests are reported for ECLRS , they are not part of this analysis . Thus , the impact would be minimal . Third , deterministic database matches may exclude matches when identifiers are not identical because of factors such as incorrect dates of birth , spelling of names , and maiden names versus married names . This analysis was limited to cases with completed interviews , and those with incomplete interviews may have differed ( willingness to participate in disease surveillance ) . Finally , this analysis covers a period when universal COVID - 19 case investigations and contact tracing were no longer recommended ( 34 ) . As such , this study was based on COVID - 19 case investigations conducted during the study period . These findings indicate that those excluded from the official metrics are less likely to be hospitalized and have less potential for severe disease , as measured by age , vaccination status , and underlying conditions . .
