MOLECULAR BIOLOGY Transcription - coupled changes in nuclear mobility of mammalian cis - regulatory elements Bo Gu , 1 Tomek Swigut , 1 Andrew Spencley , 1 , 2 Matthew R . Bauer , 1 Mingyu Chung , 1 Tobias Meyer , 1 Joanna Wysocka 1 , 3 , 4 , 5 * To achieve guide RNA ( gRNA ) multiplexingand an efficient deliveryof tens of distinct gRNAs into single cells , we developed a molecular assembly strategy termed chimeric array of gRNA oligonucleotides ( CARGO ) . We coupled CARGO with dCas9 ( catalytically dead Cas9 ) imaging to quantitatively measure the movement of enhancers and promoters that undergo differentiation - associated activity changes in live embryonic stem cells . Whereas all examined functional elements exhibited subdiffusive behavior , their relative mobility increased concurrently with transcriptional activation . Furthermore , acute perturbation of RNA polymerase II activity can reverse these activity - linked increases in loci mobility . Through quantitative CARGO - dCas9 imaging , we provide direct measurements of cis - regulatory element dynamics in living cells and distinct cellular and activity states and uncover an intrinsic connection between cis - regulatory element mobility and transcription . C is - regulatoryDNAelementssuchaspromot - ersandlong - rangeenhancersmediatepre - cisespatiotemporalcontrolofgeneexpression ( 1 – 4 ) . Understanding regulatoryelements ’ dynamics in living cells and their changes in relation to transcriptional status and cellular states is important for comprehending gene ex - pression control . To explore these questions , we first had to address technical limitations asso - ciated with the labeling of small , nonrepetitive genomic elements . Previous strategies typically relied on inserting heterologous arrays of bacte - rialoperatorsequencesthataremuchlargerthanatypicalindividualenhancerorpromoterand , owing to their highly repetitive nature , may be subject to regulation specific for repetitive se - quences ( 5 – 10 ) . Alternatively , dCas9 ( catalytically dead Cas9 ) imaging can facilitate RNA - guided labeling of native genomic regions ( 11 ) , but similarly to other methods , it requires a large number of fluorescent molecules bound to the targetlocusatanygiventimetoenablemicroscopicvisualization . Consequently , in the absence of ap - proaches allowing for highly multiplexed and uni - formdeliveryofguideRNAs ( gRNAs ) totargetcells , dCas9 imaging has been practically limited to the labeling of repetitive sequences ( 12 – 15 ) . To overcome this bottleneck , we developed a molecular assembly strategy , termed chimeric array of gRNA oligonucleotides ( CARGO ) , that can achieve highly multiplexed gRNA delivery into single cells ( diagram in Fig . 1A ) . With this strategy , gRNA 12 - and 18 - nucleotide monomers can be readily assembled in a single step with 70 % and 60 % efficiencies , respectively , and an evenhigherdegreeofmultiplexingcanbereadilyaccomplished ( fig . S1 ; see materials and methods andothersupplementarymaterialsfordetailsandprotocol ) . We then asked whether robust labeling of nonrepetitive cis - regulatory elements can be achievedinmammaliancellsbycombiningCARGOwithdCas9imaging . Tothisend , wechosemouse embryonic stem cells ( mESCs ) and their in vitro differentiation to epiblast - like cells ( mEpiLCs ) as a cell fate transition model ( 16 – 18 ) ( fig . S2A ) . We havepreviouslyshown thatduring thistransition a cluster of enhancers located ~ 30 to 54 kb down - stream from the Fgf5 promoter is activated de novo ( 17 ) ( fig . S2B ) and that these changes are accompanied by the transcriptional induction of the Fgf5 gene ( 17 ) . To label this developmen - tally regulated enhancer cluster , we designed three CARGO arrays , each harboring 12 different gRNAs , spanning a 2 - kb window immediately upstream of the first enhancer ( E1 ) within the cluster ( fig . S2B ) . We generated clonal mESC lines with a stably integrated , inducible dCas9 - eGFP transgene expressed at relatively low ( albeit clone - to - clone – variable ) level upon induction with doxycycline ( Dox ) ( fig . S3 , A and B ) . As ex - pected ( 11 ) , dCas9 - eGFP displayed previously observed nucleolar retention in the absence of gRNAandrobustlylabeledtelomericrepeatsupon transfection with telomere gRNA ( Fig . 1B ) . Upon transfection of the three Fgf5 enhancer CARGO arrays , one or two puncta were clearly visible in live cells to which arrays were successfully in - troduced , as measured by a fluorescent marker encoded by the CARGO plasmid ( Fig . 1B ) . The labelingwasspecific , asconfirmedbythecolocal - ization of the dCas9 - eGFP immunofluorescence and Fgf5 DNA fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) signals ( Fig . 1C ) , and efficient , as 60 % to 70 % ofcellsacrossdifferentlineswereconsistently labeled with one or two puncta with a sufficiently high signal to background ratio ( Fig . 1 , D and E ) . We next investigated both the precision of the dCas9 targeting and its potential interfer - ence with enhancer activation during differen - tiation . We performed anti - GFP ( green fluorescent protein ) and anti - H3K27ac ( acetylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 ) chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) – quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( qPCR ) analyses from dCas9 - eGFP mESCs with or without a CARGO array , and from mEpiLCs derived from them through 48 hours of differ - entiation . Using qPCR amplicons spanning either the CARGO - array targeted region ( a to c ) or en - hancer E1 itself ( d and e ) ( fig . S2B ) , we observed that : ( i ) dCas9 recruitment is dependent on the array and localized to the targeted region , and ( ii ) enhancer activation , as indirectly measured by H3K27ac , retains its developmental dynamics and is not considerably affected by dCas9 - eGFP recruitment in the vicinity ( fig . S2 , C and D ) . In agreement , Fgf5 mRNA single - molecule FISH ( smFISH ) analysis of mEpiLC dCas9 - eGFP cells with or without a CARGO array showed no signif - icant differences in transcript numbers between the two populations ( fig . S4A ) . Taken together , these results demonstrate that CARGO - dCas9 imaging provides a specific and noninvasive strat - egy to label functional cis - regulatory sequences in their native chromosomal context . To follow the movement of the Fgf5 enhancer in its active and inactive state , we performed live CARGO - dCas9 imaging in mESCs or in mEpiLCs after 48 hours of differentiation and tracked centers of labeled loci with high temporal reso - lution ( Fig . 2A and movie S1 ) . Visual inspection of the recorded time - lapse images revealed that a substantial fraction of Fgf5 enhancers displayed increased mobility in mEpiLCs compared with mESCs ( compare movies S2 and S3 ) , and this was also evident when we examined individual trajec - tories over a fixed time interval ( Fig . 2A , compare c and d ) . To characterize the Fgf5 enhancer move - ment quantitatively , we computed the mean square displacement ( MSD ) for these trajectories ( Fig . 2B ) and extracted two parameters : the scaling exponent a and the apparent diffusion coefficient D app . Time - averaged MSD ( tMSD ) plots show an anomalous scaling exponent of a = 0 . 53 ± 0 . 21 in mESCs and a = 0 . 51 ± 0 . 26 in mEpiLCs ( Fig . 2B ) , suggesting subdiffusive behavior of the enhancer , similar to chromosome movement in bacte - ria , yeast , and B cells ( 8 , 19 , 20 ) . Additionally , a comparable scaling exponent a ( 0 . 54 in mESCs and 0 . 51 in mEpiLCs ) was obtained from the time - and ensemble - averaged MSD ( eMSD ) plots ( Fig . 2B , shaded area denotes SEM ) , indicating that the loci movements are ergodic . Whereas the scaling exponent extracted from our MSD measurements was similar for the two examined cell states , the apparent anomalous diffusion coefficient of the Fgf5 enhancer exhib - ited a significant increase in mEpiLCs compared with ESCs ( Fig . 2C and table S2 ) .

RESEARCH | REPORT D app with slow diffusivity in both cellular states [ Fig . 3 , A and B ; fig . S5 , bottom panel ; fig . S6 ( for tMSD and eMSD plots ) ; and fig . S7D ] . These ob - servations suggest that mobility of cis - regulatory elements may be linked to their activity status and that the underlying heterogeneity of this dynamics could reflect the heterogeneity of the transcriptional state . Alternatively , these mo - bility shifts could be explained by the global differences in chromatin properties and / or com - paction associated with mESC and mEpiLC states . To distinguish between these two possibilities , we labeled the promoter and distal superenhancer of Tbx3 , a gene that becomes down - regulated during the mESC - to - mEpiLC transition ( Fig . 3A and fig . S5 , middle panel ) . Notably , CARGO - dCas9 imaging of the Tbx3 promoter or superenhancer located ~ 90 kb away from the TSS revealed changes in mobility that were opposite to those observed at the Fgf5 locus [ Fig . 3B , fig . S6 ( for tMSD and eMSD plots ) , and movies S4 and S5 ] . Analysis of the combined live - cell tracking data of all seven regulatory elements in both cellular states suggests that as a first - order approximation , the observed heterogeneity of cis - regulatory ele - ment dynamics can be better explained by a two - population model [ D BIC = − 143 . 2 ; BIC , Bayesian information criterion ] versus a single - population model , where the apparent diffusivity of the fast population is three to four times higher than that of the slow population ( Fig . 3C ) . We compared the extracted fast versus slow population fractions for all seven tested loci in either mESCs or mEpiLCs and observed a statistically significant increase of the fast population in the transcriptionally active state ( Fig . 3D and fig . S7A ) . However , because the fitted standard deviations of D app distribution in the fast state are broad , it remains an open ques - tion whether a single D app value for the fast state exists or whether there is a continuum that is dependent on the level of transcription and locus - specific effects . The scaling exponent a was comparable ( ~ 0 . 5 ) for all examined elements in both cellular states ( fig . S7B and table S2 ) and close to the a values obtained through measurements of chromatin movementinmammaliancells , yeast , andbacteria . Theseobservationssuggestthatthesubdiffusivebehaviorandscalinglawsgoverningthemove - mentofcis - regulatoryelementsintheinterphase nuclei are similar to those of other classes of chromatin and are conserved across the tree of life . Furthermore , thecomparable shapeand neg - ative dip of the time - lag – rescaled velocity auto - correlation function indicate thatthe viscoelastic nature of nucleoplasm and chromatin fibers can explain the subdiffusive scaling behavior of cis - regulatory elements ( 8 ) in both the active and inactive states ( fig . S7C ) . To gain more insight into the relationship be - tween the cis - regulatory element mobility and the transcriptional status of its cognate gene at the single - cell level , we collected matched live – fixed cell data by tracking Fgf5 enhancer movement in live mEpiLCs and measuring transcriptional sta - tus in the same cells by smFISH with the intronic and exonic Fgf5 mRNA probes ( see fig . S8 for specificity validation ) . We took advantage of the expression heterogeneity during differentiation and classified cells into three categories : actively transcribing ( Fgf5 intronic + , Fgf5 exonic + ) , Gu et al . , Science 359 , 1050 – 1055 ( 2018 ) 2 March 2018 3 of 6 Fig . 2 .

By analyzing the smFISH signals in relation to the Fgf5 enhancer mobility , we observed that in cells with Fgf5 mRNA transcripts , the enhancer ex - plores a larger nuclear space over a given time compared with in the inactive cells , with the highest mobility observed for enhancer alleles that are actively transcribing at the time of mea - surement ( Fig . 4 , A and B ) . This strong association suggests a direct connection between transcrip - tional activity and cis - regulatory element mobility . To directly test the relationship between the status of RNA polymerase II ( Pol II ) and the anom - alous diffusive behavior of the Fgf5 enhancer , we acutely ( for 10 to 30 min ) perturbed Pol II activity by using chemical inhibitors targeting either tran - scriptional elongation ( DRB and flavopiridol ) ( 21 , 22 ) or transcriptional initiation ( triptolide ) ( 23 , 24 ) . Tracking Fgf5 enhancer mobility revealed that inhibition of either initiation or elongation results in a significant reduction of D app , both in bulk measurements of eMSD across all cells ( Fig . 4C ) and at the single - cell level , as measured by tMSD in matched single cells before and after the treatment ( Fig . 4D ) . Notably , alleles showing higher D app values in untreated cells ( and thus representing the fast subpopulation ) were the most affected by the Pol II inhibition . Similar de - creases in D app upon Pol II inhibition were also observed for the Tbx3 promoter in mESCs ( fig . S9 ) . Together , our observations indicate that the increased nuclear mobility of cis - regulatory ele - ments is directly coupled to the Pol II activity and transcriptional status of their cognate genes . The CARGO assembly method described here has a wide application potential beyond im - aging , in techniques such as CRISPR interfer - ence , CRISPR activation , and in simultaneous editing of multiple genomic regions , where multi - plexed recruitment of dCas9 or Cas9 to genomic loci of interest is required or desired . Through CARGO - dCas9 visualization and quantitative measurement of cis - regulatory element dynam - ics in distinct activity states , we uncovered an unexpected relationship between the mobility of cis - regulatory elements and local transcriptional activity . What may be the underlying causes of the observed transcription - coupled increases in mobility ? Although the exact formulations vary with different polymer models ( 25 ) , D app gener - ally rises with increased molecular agitation ( e . g . , absolute temperature in the simplest form but also nonthermal sources of agitation ) and with decreased friction and / or viscosity and polymer size . Several lines of evidence suggest that the increase in D app may be due to a nonthermal mo - lecular motion generated by an energy - dissipating biochemical process ( 26 ) . The main candidate for such a process in our studies is the activity of RNA Pol II — a major molecular motor that trans - locates through the chromatin and dissipates energy via pyrophosphate release — although transcription - coupled adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) – dependent chromatin remodelers may also contribute to the local movement . Collectively , we propose that Gu et al . , Science 359 , 1050 – 1055 ( 2018 ) 2 March 2018 4 of 6 Fig . 3 .

( E ) The stirring model provides an explanation for observed transcription - coupledchanges inthe mobilityofcis - regulatoryelements . The ground state ( slow ) is characterized by subdiffusive behavior with low apparent diffusivity governed by thermal forces . The activated ( fast ) state is characterized by an increased apparent diffusivity , which may be due to nonthermal agitation by transcribing RNA Pol II and / or its associated ATPases . Under the assumption that the radius of a local 3D chromosomal domain remains relatively invariant in the slow and fast states , elevated mobility of cis - regulatory elements would lead to decreased time to the first encounterbetweendistallylocatedenhancerandpromoterregions , resulting in an increased enhancer - promoter contact frequency . RESEARCH | REPORT ongoing transcription may provide a source of nonthermal molecular agitation that can “ stir ” the chromatin within the local chromosomal domain , leading to an increase in anomalous D app ( Fig . 4E ) . We will hereafter refer to this hypothesis as the “ stirring model . ” The stirring model may have implications for transcription regulation : Under the assumption that the radius of the local chromosomal domain [ such as a topologically associated domain ( TAD ) ] does not substantially change in the examined cell state ( s ) , the time to the first encounter be - tween distally located enhancer and promoter regions should decrease along with the increased mobility within the domain . In other words , enhancer - promoter contact frequencies may in - crease upon transcriptional activation due to the increased probability of the stochastic encounters within the TAD , rather than due to the formation of stable enhancer - promoter loops ( Fig . 4E ) . This type of mechanism could provide a positive - feedback loop facilitating gene expression robust - ness once transcription is initiated , as increased mobility would boost enhancer - promoter contact frequencies , in turn leading to more transcription .
