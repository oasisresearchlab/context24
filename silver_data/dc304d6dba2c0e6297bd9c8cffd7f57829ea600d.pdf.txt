However , theoretical and empirical research now shows that individual users—consumers—are also a major and increasingly important source of new product and service designs . In this paper , we build a microeconomic model of a market that incorporates demand - side innovation and competition . We explain the conditions under which ﬁrms ﬁnd it beneﬁcial to invest in supporting and harvesting users’ innovations , and we show that social welfare rises when ﬁrms utilize this source of innovation . Our modeling also indicates reasons for policy interventions with respect to a mixed user and producer innovation economy . From the social welfare perspective , as the share of innovating users in a market increases , proﬁt - maximizing ﬁrms tend to switch “too late” from a focus on internal research and development to a strategy of also supporting and harvesting user innovations . Underlying this inefﬁciency are externalities that the producer cannot capture . Overall , our results explain when and how the proliferation of innovating users leads to a superior division of innovative labor involving complementary investments by users and producers , both beneﬁtting producers and increasing social welfare .

Introduction and Overview Innovation has traditionally been seen as the province of producers who invest in product and service devel - opment to sell their innovations . However , extensive theoretical and empirical research has now led to an understanding that users are also a major source of innovation development , where users are deﬁned as entities that develop novel products and services for use rather than sale . Over the last three decades , user innovation by individual citizens has moved from being considered an anomaly to being recognized as an activity conducted by many millions of users that results in the creation of many individually and commercially important new products and services ( von Hippel 2005 , Bogers et al . 2009 , von Hippel et al . 2012 ) . Further , it is now understood that the range of innovation opportunities viable for innovation by users , acting both individually and collaboratively , is increasing over time ( Baldwin and von Hippel 2011 ) . Despite increased understanding of the importance of the phenomenon , innovation by users and particularly by end users—consumers—has not yet been incor - porated into standard microeconomic thinking and modeling of markets for innovative products and ser - vices ( Syam and Pazgal 2013 ) . Our objective in this paper is to begin this major task . We ﬁrst describe processes that occur within what we term the user and producer innovation “paradigms , ” and then we describe the four types of interactions between them . With this description in hand , we next analyze the impact of paradigm interactions in an analytical model of a market where both producers and users innovate , and we then develop and discuss theoretical , policy , and managerial implications . In overview , we explain that consumer innovators have two linked attributes from the point of view of pro - ducers , one positive and one negative . On the positive side , they can develop new product designs of potential commercial value . On the negative side , their ability to 1 D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 18 . 51 . 1 . 88 ] on 06 J u l y 2016 , a t 07 : 52 .

Gambardella , Raasch , and von Hippel : The User Innovation Paradigm 2 Management Science , Articles in Advance , pp . 1 – 19 , ©2016 INFORMS self - provision can reduce the producer’s market . Exam - ples are legion : users develop and self - provision video game and software “mods” to commercial products they use , with some of these later being commercialized by vendors ( Jeppesen and Frederiksen 2006 ) . Users also develop and self - provision hardware products , such as “customized” cars and motorcycles , with producers later commercializing some of the features they develop ( Harley - Davidson 2016 ) . In our model , we explore the interplay of two key variables . The ﬁrst is the share of user innovators in a producer marketplace ; i . e . , users who can innovate , self - provide , and / or buy as they prefer . The second describes producers’ choice between two archetypal modes of organizing for innovation : The ﬁrst is the tra - ditional mode in which producers invest in research and development ( R & D ) without paying much attention to user innovation . They view their R & D as “exhaustive” in the sense that it covers all the facets—from design to technology—that need to be addressed to serve the market . Thus , their R & D substitutes for any potential contributions from the user domain because even if the users innovate , ﬁrms have developed competing solutions internally . The second archetypal mode for producers to organize innovation involves a more “open” approach whereby they design their R & D to be complementary with user innovation activities . In this mode , ﬁrms take into account that users can innovate and seek to conduct in - house R & D activities that are complementary to user innovation . Our major ﬁndings are three . First , we explore the optimal producer strategies—traditional versus open— and welfare effects associated with a rise in the propor - tion of innovating users in a market from near - zero to a higher fraction . We ﬁnd that when the propor - tion of innovating users in a producer market is very low , proﬁts are maximized by producers choosing the traditional , producer - centric mode of innovation , sub - stituting for any innovative contributions the few user innovators could make and not investing in supporting them in any way . The added number of commercially valuable innovations users could produce is too low to justify the producer investments and the risk of information spillovers to additional users who could then also potentially choose to self - provision . When the proportion of innovating users in a market - place increases from low to moderate levels , it becomes increasingly attractive for producers to switch to the user - augmented mode of innovation that is based on user – producer complementarity , and to invest in providing innovating users with tools to support their efforts . At a tipping point identiﬁed via the model , the beneﬁt in commercially valuable innovations spilled over from innovating users to producers makes this sec - ond strategy more proﬁtable than an exclusive focus on commercially performed R & D . This is so even though a side effect of these investments is loss of potential market via increased self - provisioning capabilities and activities among innovating users . As our second major ﬁnding , we show that as the proportion of innovating users in a market grows , ﬁrms generally switch “too late” to investing in supporting user innovation from the social welfare perspective . That is , social welfare would be better served if ﬁrms switched when the share of user innovators in the market is smaller than proﬁt maximization would dictate . Underlying this inefﬁciency are externalities that the producer cannot capture , e . g . , what we will describe as a “tinkering surplus” that accrues to users . Third , we ﬁnd that any government policies that have the effect of raising the productivity of innovating users encourage ﬁrms to switch to the user - augmented mode and do not reduce welfare . By contrast , govern - ment policies such as intellectual property rights and R & D subsidies that speciﬁcally support producer R & D increase the proclivity of producers to switch to an open innovation mode too late , or even encourage ﬁrms to switch back to the traditional producer - innovation mode and thereby may reduce welfare . In net , the contributions of our paper are among the ﬁrst to integrate the user and producer paradigms and their interactions in one modeling framework . In our microeconomic model , what is traditionally viewed as the demand side of the market becomes a source of innovative designs and products . We show how the interactions between the user and producer paradigms affect the creation and distribution of value in a market relative to the standard model of producer innovation only . The model leverages standard welfare economics with externalities to analytically capture and analyze the paradigm shift toward innovation by individual users . This approach produces results , such as the policy theorem ( the third ﬁnding described just above ) , that are not straightforward based on standard welfare economics . It also yields novel testable predictions , e . g . , about the level of producer investment in support of user innovation and about the relationship between the share of innovating users and producer proﬁts . Finally , we identify tinkering surplus as a third component of social welfare in addition to proﬁts and consumer surplus in markets with user innovation and self - provisioning . Overall , our paper advances the concept of a division of labor in innovation between users and producers . We ﬁnd that more labor shifted to users than produc - ers would ﬁnd optimal maximizes value creation in markets for innovation . If users’ capabilities to inno - vate are expanding in many industries , as has been argued ( Baldwin and von Hippel 2011 ) , innovation tasks can and should increasingly be shifted to the demand side . To stay competitive , companies should carefully observe market trends , especially the share of D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 18 . 51 . 1 . 88 ] on 06 J u l y 2016 , a t 07 : 52 .

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows : In § 2 we describe what we term the user and producer innovation “paradigms” and the evidence for each . In § 3 we describe four types of interactions between the user and producer paradigms and the evidence for these . In § 4 we present a model to theorize the impact of user innovation on producer proﬁts and social welfare . In § 5 we discuss our ﬁndings and suggest implications for research , policy , and practice . 2 . User and Producer Innovation Paradigms In this section , we ﬁrst provide some key deﬁnitions integral to the user and producer innovation paradigms . Then we describe and contrast the functioning of these two paradigms . 2 . 1 . Key Deﬁnitions A single user innovator is a single ﬁrm or individual that creates an innovation in order to use it . Examples are a single ﬁrm creating a process machine in order to use it , a surgeon creating a new medical device in order to use it , and an individual consumer creating a new piece of sporting equipment in order to use it ( von Hippel 2005 ) . In this paper , as was mentioned previously , we focus on user innovations by individuals only . A producer innovator is a single ﬁrm or individual anticipating proﬁting from their designs by selling design information or products based on that “recipe” to others : by deﬁnition , they obtain no direct use - value from them . Examples of producer innovators are a ﬁrm or individual that patents an invention and licenses it to others and a ﬁrm that develops a new product Figure 1 ( Color online ) The User and Producer Innovation and Diffusion Paradigms Marketdiffusion Innovationby users Collaborative evaluation / replication / improvement Peer - to - peer diffusion Producer innovation and diffusion User innovation and diffusion R & D Production Innovationsupport Innovationdesigns Marketresearch or service to sell to its customers ( von Hippel 2005 , Baldwin and von Hippel 2011 ) . A design is a set of instructions that specify how to produce a novel product or service . These instructions can be thought of as a recipe for accomplishing the functional requirements of the design ( Baldwin and Clark 2006 , Baldwin and von Hippel 2011 ) . In the case of products or services that themselves consist of information such as software , a design for an innovation can be virtually identical to the usable product itself . In the case of a physical product , the design recipe must be converted into a physical form before it can be used . Free revealing occurs when an innovator gives up exclusive intellectual property rights to an innovation design , and all interested parties are given access to it—the information becomes a public good ( Harhoff et al . 2003 ) . Self - provisioning occurs when a user makes a copy of a product or service for him - or herself independent of producers . Innovating users self - provision when they build a working copy of their innovation for their own use . Adopting users self - provision when they build a copy of a user innovation—or a producer product—for their own use . 2 . 2 . The User Innovation Paradigm The sequence of activities carried out by individual innovating users within the user innovation paradigm is represented by the broad arrow shown in the top half of Figure 1 . It is important to emphasize that from left to right , it involves user activities only ; no producers are involved . At the left side of the arrow , we see users developing new products and services to serve their own in - house needs . In any given inno - vation category , they often begin to innovate before D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 18 . 51 . 1 . 88 ] on 06 J u l y 2016 , a t 07 : 52 .

Gambardella , Raasch , and von Hippel : The User Innovation Paradigm 4 Management Science , Articles in Advance , pp . 1 – 19 , ©2016 INFORMS producers do , as shown by the leftward positioning of the arrow . This is the case especially in instances where innovations offer functional novelty relative to existing products , because users are then in a better position to perceive an innovation opportunity before producers do . This is because of the sticky informa - tion they possess regarding their needs and context of use ( von Hippel 2005 ) . Users then may elect to freely reveal their innovation designs to any and all without compensation . As shown at the center of the arrow , when users in addition to the innovator have an interest in the innovation , this can trigger an open collaborative user innovation process ( Baldwin and von Hippel 2011 ) . Such processes involve contributors who share the work of developing a new product or service and who also reveal the outputs from their individual and collective design efforts openly for anyone to use . Free diffusion of innovation - related information to non - innovators via peer - to - peer transfer also occurs and is shown at the right end of the user innovation paradigm arrow . The necessary condition underlying both user improvement activities and straight adoption activities by users peer to peer is that adopters have the capa - bility to produce copies of a user - created innovative design for themselves . This capability is increasingly extant among individual users with respect to both software ( where the “recipe” is the product ) and hard - ware designs . With the proliferation of digital products and services and also the rise of three - dimensional printing and other modes of decentralized production , increasing numbers of innovating and noninnovating users will be able to self - provision without producer intermediation ( Baldwin and von Hippel 2011 ) . Studies of national representative samples of individ - ual citizens in ﬁve developed countries document the scale of the sequence of innovation activities described in the user innovation paradigm ( see Table 1 ) . These studies ﬁnd that from 3 . 7 % to 6 . 1 % of citizens report having engaged in developing or modifying consumer products to better serve their own needs . This involves millions of citizens collectively investing billions of dollars annually in product development . With respect Table 1 National Survey Data on the Scale of Product Development by Users United Kingdom United States Japan ( n = 1 , 173 ) ( n = 1 , 992 ) ( n = 2 , 000 ) % consumer innovators in the population aged ≥ 18 6 . 1 5 . 2 3 . 7 Number of consumer innovators aged ≥ 18 ( million ) 2 . 9 16 . 0 4 . 7 Annual expenditures by average consumer innovator ( $ ) 1 , 801 1 , 725 1 , 479 Estimated total expenditures a by consumer innovators on consumer products per year ( billion ) $ 5 . 2 $ 20 . 2 $ 5 . 8 Estimated consumer product R & D expenditures funded by companies per year ( billion ) $ 3 . 6 $ 62 . 0 $ 43 . 4 % consumer innovations protected by IP 2 9 0 % consumer innovations that diffuse to commercializers and / or peers 17 6 . 1 5 Note .

Whereas innovations by consumers are developed for their own use , typically without consideration of their possible value to others , individuals’ needs are often similar . For this reason , many of their innovations are , in fact , of value to others as well ( de Jong et al . 2015 ) . It has been shown that about half of consumer inno - vators are willing to share their designs with others free of charge ( de Jong et al . 2015 , de Jong 2016 ) . As shown in Table 1 , only a small fraction of innovating con - sumers protect their designs by acquiring intellectual property . As can be seen in Table 2 , empirical research on representative samples of user innovators ﬁnds that 44 % of innovating individual users in Finland and 66 % in Canada are willing to freely reveal their innovations to any and all without compensation . A further 40 % in Finland and 22 % in Canada are willing to reveal with - out charge but selectively ( de Jong et al . 2015 , de Jong 2016 ) . Research on users participating in communities with a shared innovation interest , such as the design of sporting equipment or software , have found essentially 100 % of those communities are willing to freely reveal their innovations ( Franke and Shah 2003 , Harhoff and Mayrhofer 2010 ) . 2 . 3 . The Producer Innovation Paradigm The bottom broad arrow in Figure 1 is a schematic representation of the “linear” producer innovation paradigm . By our earlier deﬁnition , producer innovators invest in creating a new design to proﬁt by selling instantiations of it ; they obtain no direct use - value from it . In the sequence of activities shown in the producer innovation paradigm , producers begin their innovation process by studying user needs , and then they perform R & D as required to develop and produce novel prod - ucts and services . On the right - hand side of the broad arrow , we see that they then diffuse what they have created via sales in the marketplace . Because producers would lose proﬁts if other producers adopted their innovations without payment , innovating producers D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 18 . 51 . 1 . 88 ] on 06 J u l y 2016 , a t 07 : 52 .

Sources of data are de Jong et al . ( 2015 ) and de Jong ( 2016 ) . generally do not freely reveal their innovation designs . Indeed , they often try to prevent design information spillovers via such means as secrecy and intellectual property rights . The “producer innovation paradigm” is today deeply embedded in research , public policy , and governmental statistics . With respect to research , almost all academic work on innovation is based on improving our under - standing of and management of producer innovation ( Schumpeter 1943 / 2003 , Bush 1945 , Godin 2006 , Aghion et al . 2013 ) . With respect to public policy , the producer innovation mode is the central theoretical pillar that justiﬁes public policies granting subsidies or intellectual property rights to producers ( Penrose 1951 , Teece 1986 , Gallini and Scotchmer 2002 ) . 3 . Interactions Between User and Producer Innovation Modes Drawing on academic literature , this section distin - guishes four pure types of interaction between the user and producer innovation modes : As indicated by the transparent arrows in Figure 1 , ( 1 ) producers may supply information , tools , and platforms that make user innovation and modiﬁcation easier . ( 2 ) Via free or selectively free or compensated revealing , users may transfer innovative designs to incumbent or start - up producers . Further , innovative outputs diffusing peer to peer in the user paradigm , and via the marketplace in the producer paradigm , both ( 3 ) compete with and ( 4 ) complement each other . All four pure types of interaction will be explicated in § § 3 . 1 – 3 . 4 , and hybrids will be considered in § 3 . 5 . 3 . 1 . Producer Support for User Innovation When users innovate , or when producers wish them to do so , producers may want to invest to support them to increase their levels of activity and also to direct them toward design activities of potential commercial value to the producers . The empirical literature describes a plethora of such producer investments : producers may sponsor a user innovation community ( West and Lakhani 2008 , Bayus 2013 ) or a design contest ( Füller 2010 , Boudreau et al . 2011 ) . They may also “open up” their product designs to make them easier for users to modify ( MacCormack et al . 2006 , Balka and Raasch 2014 ) , or they may provide users with kits of tools to enable them to make their own designs more easily ( von Hippel and Katz 2002 , Franke and Piller 2004 ) . Moreover , ﬁrms often engage in boundary spanning activities and invest the working time of employees in supporting innovating users ( Henkel 2008 , Colombo et al . 2013 ) . 3 . 2 . User Innovation Spillovers to Producers In this case , the interaction between user and producer is the transfer of user - created innovative designs to the producer . Transfer is typically for free , but sometimes it may also involve a market transaction of buying or licensing a user design ( Antorini et al . 2012 , de Jong et al . 2015 ) . Designs that producers ﬁnd of commercial value are then supplied to the market at large . Evidence from a Finnish nationally representative survey of consumer innovators shows that 6 % of innovation designs developed by consumers for their own use are adopted and commercialized by existing producers , and an additional 2 % are commercialized by user - formed start - up ventures ( de Jong et al . 2015 ) . The literature shows that user innovation spillovers can be exceedingly valuable to producer ﬁrms ( Lilien et al . 2002 , Smith and Shah 2013 ) . In studies from several industries , the best user - generated solutions and product concepts have been found to be more novel and to offer higher customer beneﬁt than the best producer - generated ones ( Poetz and Schreier 2012 ) , which translates into higher sales revenues and gross margins ( Lilien et al . 2002 , Nishikawa et al . 2013 ) and longer product life cycles ( Nishikawa et al . 2013 ) . 3 . 3 . User - Complemented Markets From Figure 1 we can see that the user and producer innovation and diffusion channels can operate inde - pendently , creating and diffusing innovative designs . In some cases , an innovation diffused for free by users complements one or more innovations diffused by pro - ducers , creating what we term a user - complemented market . The key characteristic of a user - complemented market is that one or more users self - provision comple - ments to a product offered on the market by a producer . The distinction that matters here is self - supply and not the source of the innovative design being pro - duced . A user may have invented the design himself , or adopted it from another user , with or without further modiﬁcation , or even from a producer in the market for complements . User - complemented markets can involve products that are separate from but complementary to producer products and / or can involve modiﬁcations or other complements built onto or into producer products or platforms . In either case , they are user - created comple - ments that are diffused peer to peer . With respect to the former , consider that techniques for using products are D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 18 . 51 . 1 . 88 ] on 06 J u l y 2016 , a t 07 : 52 .

Gambardella , Raasch , and von Hippel : The User Innovation Paradigm 6 Management Science , Articles in Advance , pp . 1 – 19 , ©2016 INFORMS useful or even essential complements to producer prod - ucts , and they are often developed by users ( Hyysalo 2009 , Morlacchi and Nelson 2011 , Hinsch et al . 2013 ) . For example , whitewater kayakers develop and non - commercially diffuse novel kayaking techniques that are essential complements to whitewater kayaking equipment ( Hienerth 2016 ) . With respect to comple - ments built into or onto producer products , consider software modiﬁcations and additions that complement the value of basic commercial software products in ﬁelds ranging from music software to computer gaming software ( Jeppesen and Frederiksen 2006 , Prügl and Schreier 2006 , Boudreau and Jeppesen 2015 ) . The evidence for the widespread presence of user - complemented markets runs counter to the conventional assumption that only producers provide complements , although users may select and assem - ble them ( Sanchez and Mahoney 1996 , Schilling 2000 , Jacobides 2005 , Adner and Kapoor 2010 , Baldwin 2010 ) . 3 . 4 . User - Contested Markets Again referring to Figure 1 , we can see that the user and producer innovation and diffusion channels can oper - ate independently , creating and diffusing innovative designs . In some cases , an innovation diffused for free by users substitutes for one or more products diffused by producers , creating what we term a user - contested market . The key characteristic of a user - contested mar - ket is that one or more users via self - provisioning build for themselves substitutes to a product offered on the market by a producer . Recall that the factor that matters is user self - supply of a full or partial substitute for a commercial offering and not the source of the innovative design being self - provisioned . As illustration , the market for recreational sailboats is a user - contested one . Some sailors can and do build their own innovative or noninnovative boats rather than purchasing a boat supplied by a producer ( Raasch et al . 2008 ) . Some dynamics underlying user - contested markets have been explored in the context of innovation and competition among “open source” and “closed source” software suppliers ( Casadesus - Masanell and Ghemawat 2006 , Sen 2007 ) . According to this literature , “open source projects” supply their code for free ; they do not behave strategically in competition with commercial substitutes . Users can choose to contribute to the supply of open source software code , to free ride on the effort of others , or to buy the producer software . Their choices are determined by heterogeneity in users’ willingness to pay , development capabilities , adoption costs , and impatience for a solution meeting their needs . Conclusions of this literature are that open source projects can establish themselves as competitors to closed software producers ; producers lose proﬁt because of this competition ; and consumers beneﬁt from the existence of an open source alternative , unless it forces proprietary ﬁrms to exit the market ( Kuan 2001 , Baldwin and Clark 2006 , Casadesus - Masanell and Ghemawat 2006 , Lin 2008 ) . 3 . 5 . Hybrids Note that to this point we have distinguished and explained four pure types of user – producer interactions . However , real - world interactions may well be hybrids of these . For instance , a pure case of user innovation spillovers occurs when a user creates a design and transfers it to a producer for commercialization without making a copy for in - house use ( Füller 2010 ) . A hybrid case of spillovers plus user - contested market would involve a user ( s ) making a copy ( s ) and also transferring innovation design information to a producer ( e . g . , de Jong and von Hippel 2009 ) . The very fact that real - world user – producer inter - actions are often hybrids is a source of complexity , requiring strategic decision making by producer ﬁrms with respect to balancing off multiple effects . For exam - ple , producer ﬁrms making decisions with respect to investing in user innovation support versus their own R & D must consider effects both with respect to user likelihood of developing complementary and with respect to substitute innovations . To improve our understanding of producer decision making and its consequences for user innovators , noninnovating users , and society at large , we next proceed to formalize these considerations in an analytical model . 4 . Model Setup and Findings In this section , we provide both needed model con - textual “setup” information and related ﬁndings in combination . 4 . 1 . User Types and Tinkering Surplus We divide a producer’s potential market into two types of users : innovating users and noninnovating users . Innovating users ﬁnd it viable to develop and self - provision innovative designs related to the pro - ducer product , e . g . , improvements , customizations , and complements . They can also viably self - provision homemade copies of the producer product itself and so can choose whether to buy the product from a ﬁrm or to make it themselves . Noninnovating users do not have a viable option of innovating . Their costs may be too high , for example , because they lack needed skills or access to tools , or because they have a high opportunity cost for their time . However , it is viable for noninnovating users to make copies and self - provision products based on designs developed by user inno - vators at some level of quality ranging from equal to innovating users down to zero . The share of innovating users is (cid:145) , and we regard this share as exogenous and static ; users cannot change D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 18 . 51 . 1 . 88 ] on 06 J u l y 2016 , a t 07 : 52 .

Gambardella , Raasch , and von Hippel : The User Innovation Paradigm Management Science , Articles in Advance , pp . 1 – 19 , ©2016 INFORMS 7 their type . For simplicity , we normalize the size of the market to 1 , so that (cid:145) and 1 − (cid:145) are also the number of users of each respective type . With respect to the utility users derive from inno - vating , we note that empirical research ﬁnds that innovating users derive utility both from using the inno - vation they have created and from innovation “process beneﬁts” they gain from engaging in the innovation process itself , such as fun and learning ( Lakhani and Wolf 2005 , Franke et al . 2010 , Raasch and von Hippel 2013 ) . Users seek to maximize their utility from inno - vating , which we call h , by determining the optimal amount of resources , such as time , t , to devote to innovation projects : max t h ≡ (cid:149) + (cid:52)(cid:148) 1 − (cid:129) / (cid:129)(cid:53)x 1 − (cid:129) t (cid:129) + 1 − t(cid:48) ( 1 ) In Equation ( 1 ) , the parameter (cid:149) represents a user inno - vator’s utility , net of all innovation - related costs , from go - it - alone innovation projects , i . e . , when producers do nothing to support him . The second term of ( 1 ) represents the user innovator’s additional utility when a ﬁrm conducts x projects to support his endeavors . Examples of such support are the development of design tools for users and gamiﬁcation to make product design activities more enjoyable to users . The parameter (cid:129) ∈ (cid:52) 0 (cid:49) 1 (cid:53) captures whether innovating users’ utility is mostly determined by the time they invest ( high (cid:129) ) or by the extent of ﬁrm support ( low (cid:129) ) . The parameter (cid:148) > 0 captures the productivity of this process . The last term , 1 − t , captures the value of the user innovator’s remaining time that he can spend on other matters , when the total time he has available is normalized to 1 and he has decided to spend t on innovation projects . We derive from ( 1 ) that the user’s utility - maximizing time investment in innovation is t = (cid:148)x , which yields utility h = (cid:149) + (cid:52)(cid:52) 1 − (cid:129)(cid:53) / (cid:129)(cid:53)(cid:148)x + 1 . We call this expres - sion capturing users’ net beneﬁt from innovating the tinkering surplus ( TS ) , where TS is the aggregate net beneﬁt that all users gain from innovating and self - provisioning . It consists of beneﬁts from the use of the self - provisioned innovation , plus innovation process beneﬁts , as mentioned above , minus costs . When the investment of ﬁrms in user innovation support is zero , innovating users still get their go - it - alone tinkering surplus ; h = (cid:149) + 1 > 0 . If ﬁrms do invest ( x > 0 ) , TS increases as a function of the level of that investment . 4 . 2 . Shared vs . Producer - Only Innovation We decompose the value that all buyers derive from the producer product into two parts : value v that they derive from features and components that only the producer ﬁrm will develop and produce and value b that buyers derive from features and components that can be developed and produced by ﬁrms and users , jointly or in isolation . Features that only producers will ﬁnd viable to develop include those that offer limited value to many individual users . No individual user would ﬁnd it viable to develop such a feature , but producers can aggregate demand across buyers and thereby recoup their investment ( Baldwin and von Hippel 2011 ) . Fea - tures in this category may include , e . g . , product engi - neering for greater durability and ease of use , a more elaborate design , a manual to accompany the prod - uct , etc . By contrast , features b that both individual users ( typically “lead users” ) and producers can viably develop require smaller investments , compensated for by larger beneﬁts to individual user innovators . They provide high functional novelty and solve important , hitherto unmet user needs ( von Hippel 2005 ) . As the needs of lead users foreshadow demand in the market at large ( cf . deﬁnition of lead user ) , noninnovating users , too , will predictably beneﬁt from solutions to these problems with the passage of time . We assume that all users tend to have more similar assessments of the features we call b that innovative users may get involved in developing than of the features v that the producer has to develop on its own . Capturing this idea of less heterogeneity with regard to b but simplifying our analysis , we assume that users differ only in their valuations of v ( v ∼ U (cid:54) 0 (cid:49) 1 (cid:55) ) , whereas they all like b to the same degree . In our model of innovation and production by users and producers , we focus on innovations of type b , following our assumption that producers are the only ones to invest in v . Innovations with regard to b are assumed to depend on two activities . First , the volume of innovations of type b depends on the aggregate effort T exerted by all innovating users , to the extent that it is useful to the ﬁrm ( e . g . , net of redundancy ) . To streamline our analysis , we assume that the aggregate usable effort is simply proportional to the total efforts t of the (cid:145) innovating users ; that is , T = (cid:131) (cid:48) (cid:145)t , (cid:131) (cid:48) > 0 . ( We could use more complex aggregations , allowing for increasing or diminishing returns to the number of innovating users , but our results would remain materially unchanged . ) Assuming identical innovating users , and employing the optimal expression for t , t = (cid:148)x , we obtain aggregate user effort T = (cid:131)(cid:145) x (cid:49) where (cid:131) = (cid:131) (cid:48) (cid:148) comprises any factor that raises the ability of the ﬁrms to take advantage of the produc - tivity of the innovating users’ efforts to improve b . As explained earlier , the ﬁrm can inﬂuence aggregate user effort T through x projects to develop tools and platforms that support and leverage innovating users . The projects affect the time t users want to spend on innovation projects , which then affects the value of the innovative product b via aggregate effort T .

Gambardella , Raasch , and von Hippel : The User Innovation Paradigm 8 Management Science , Articles in Advance , pp . 1 – 19 , ©2016 INFORMS Second , innovations of type b are a function of some commitment of resources Y carried out by the ﬁrm . To ﬁx ideas , Y can be commercial R & D projects or any other product creation or development activity . We deﬁne Y = (cid:142)(cid:52) 1 − s(cid:53)y(cid:49) (cid:142) ≥ 0 (cid:49) where y is the total number of innovation projects of the ﬁrm . The ﬁrm allocates a share s to projects that support innovating users ( that is , x = sy ) , and the remainder , (cid:52) 1 − s(cid:53)y , goes to traditional commercial R & D projects ( either in - house or external ) . Projects that support innovating users are of little commercial value , per se , but indirectly produce value by attracting more user innovation activities . The parameter (cid:142) measures the productivity of the ﬁrm’s commercial R & D . Taking into account these two drivers of innovation— aggregate user effort T and producer R & D activ - ity Y —let the value of the innovative product to users be b = (cid:52)T (cid:130) + Y (cid:130) (cid:53) 1 / (cid:130) (cid:49) (cid:130) > 0 (cid:49) which we can rewrite as b = (cid:54)(cid:146) (cid:130) s (cid:130) + (cid:142) (cid:130) (cid:52) 1 − s(cid:53) (cid:130) (cid:55) 1 / (cid:130) y = ˜ by(cid:49) where (cid:146) ≡ (cid:131)(cid:145) and ˜ b ≡ (cid:54)(cid:146) (cid:130) s (cid:130) + (cid:142) (cid:130) (cid:52) 1 − s (cid:53) (cid:130) (cid:55) 1 / (cid:130) is the productivity of all the ﬁrm’s y projects taken together . 4 . 3 . User and Producer Innovation Activity as Substitutes or Complements The parameter (cid:130) plays an important role in our analysis . It captures two options that ﬁrms can choose from , each of which involves a distinct form of organizing tasks and resources for innovation . The ﬁrst option is such that the efforts of innovating users , T , and those of the producer , Y , are substitutes . Take , for instance , the writing of new software code . Suppose that both the producer and users can work on each of two tasks : ( 1 ) novel functionality or ( 2 ) the creation of convenience - enhancing features such as “user - friendly” installation scripts . The more effort the producer spends on each of these tasks , the lower the innovation impact that users can make , and vice versa . One effort tends to substitute for the other . In our model , this situation is captured by (cid:130) > 1 , which implies that the marginal impact of T on b decreases as Y increases , and vice versa . The second option , by contrast , structures R & D for complementarity between user and producer inno - vation activities . In our example , suppose that users write novel code and producers develop “convenience features . ” The more effort users put into coding , the higher the impact that producers can make , and vice versa . In our model , this situation is described by 0 < (cid:130) < 1 , which implies that the marginal impact of T on b increases as Y increases , and vice versa . Research has shown that user innovators tend to focus on devel - oping innovations providing novel functionality , and producers on developing innovations that increase product reliability and user convenience ( Riggs and von Hippel 1994 , Ogawa 1998 ) . A good example in the software ﬁeld is RedHat . That ﬁrm’s commercial offerings are based on open source software code such as Linux and Apache software , developed by users , to which RedHat adds convenience features such as “easy installation” software scripts . To streamline our analysis , we assume that each ﬁrm can pick its preferred innovation option but not the speciﬁc level of (cid:130) . A fully endogenous (cid:130) would add complexity without substantial new insight . In practice , its value will depend on the industry in question , the technologies available to the ﬁrm , and best practices for integrating innovating users in R & D . 4 . 4 . Individual Market Demands of Innovating Users and Noninnovating Users Next , we need to understand the demand for the producer product from noninnovating users and from innovating users given user contestability , user - created complements , and spillovers , i . e . , the different types of interactions that we developed in § 3 . Starting with innovating users , we expect that they will buy the product from a ﬁrm only if their consumer surplus is positive and exceeds their surplus from self - provisioning , i . e . , if v + b − p + h ≥ (cid:139)b + h(cid:49) v ∼ U (cid:54) 0 (cid:49) 1 (cid:55)(cid:49) 0 ≤ (cid:139) ≤ 1 (cid:48) ( 2 ) The term v + b − p is the consumer surplus , where v + b is our value decomposition of the producer product ( cf . § 4 . 2 ) and p is its price . In case of self - provisioning , a user innovator will not get utility v , which is provided by the ﬁrm only . Of utility b that all innovating users cocreate with the ﬁrm , he will get only the “walk - away value” (cid:139)b that he can realize by learning from this cocreation process and trying to build features akin to b on his own . The quality 0 ≤ (cid:139) ≤ 1 of his self - provisioned version of b will depend on several factors , such as the extent and format of information spillovers from the ﬁrm to the user innovator , his “absorptive capacity” for the spillovers , and his skills to build the information into a usable artifact . In the case of software programming , for instance , where the producer opens up his source code for users to codevelop , (cid:139) will be close to 1 , if and as the essential design information required to replicate functionality b is fully revealed . In this example , if the producer shares only part of his source code , (cid:139) is depressed accordingly . Finally , recall the user innovator’s surplus h from her own innovation activities , including those extensions and customizations that the ﬁrm is not interested in . The user innovator is assumed to get this sur - plus h —the tinkering surplus—regardless of whether or not she buys the producer product .

Gambardella , Raasch , and von Hippel : The User Innovation Paradigm Management Science , Articles in Advance , pp . 1 – 19 , ©2016 INFORMS 9 Turning to noninnovating users , recall that they do not innovate ; they simply buy a producer - provisioned product via the market or , to the extent that they are able , can elect to replicate a design developed and then shared peer to peer by a user innovator . Building on what we said earlier about v , b , and p as constituents of demand , we expect that noninnovating users will buy on the market if v + b − p + (cid:140) (cid:48) h ≥ (cid:140)b + (cid:140) (cid:48) h(cid:49) 0 ≤ (cid:140)(cid:49) (cid:140) (cid:48) ≤ 1 ( 3 ) and self - provision otherwise . The parameters (cid:140) and (cid:140) (cid:48) in ( 3 ) capture the nonin - novating users’ ability to obtain knowledge of the in - novating users’ designs ( which will depend on the innovating users’ propensity to diffuse design infor - mation ) , to replicate them , and to beneﬁt from them . Whereas (cid:140) (cid:48) refers to a noninnovating user’s ability to beneﬁt from an individual user innovator whose design they adopt , (cid:140) captures their trickle - down beneﬁts from what the user innovator has learned from the producer as well as other innovating users during the cocre - ation process of b . Of course , when the noninnovating users buy from the ﬁrms they enjoy b incorporated in the ﬁrms’ product , whereas they enjoy (cid:140)b when they obtain the product from the innovating users through peer - to - peer diffusion . We expect noninnovating users to have imperfect knowledge of the innovating users’ designs , to be less skilled at self - provisioning them , and to beneﬁt less from using them ( (cid:140) ≤ (cid:139) and (cid:140) (cid:48) ≤ 1 ) . With respect to imperfect knowledge and higher costs of self - provisioning , consider that innovating users may well regard careful design documentation for the bene - ﬁt of potential adopters to be an unproﬁtable chore in the case of freely revealed designs ( de Jong et al . 2015 , von Hippel et al . 2014 ) . With respect to lower levels of beneﬁt , consider that the designs were developed to precisely suit the innovating users’ individual tastes . Finally , it is crucial to note the trade - off that our model implies for the producer : Firms beneﬁt from learning from innovating users about how to make a better product b for both innovating and noninnovating customers ; to that end they want to invest in x to involve users more extensively . At the same time , this comes at the cost of facilitating self - provisioning by both innovating and noninnovating users . As the producer invests in tools and tool kits , modularizes the product , or reveals design knowledge such as source code to facilitate user innovation , he also makes it easier for both innovating and noninnovating users to self - provision rather than buy . Our model assumes that the producer cannot entirely avoid this side effect of enhanced user contestability , even while choosing a mode of supporting user innovation that best serves his goals . 4 . 5 . Proﬁt Maximization by Firms The aggregate demanded quantity of 1 − (cid:145) noninnovat - ing users and (cid:145) innovating users is q = (cid:52) 1 − (cid:145)(cid:53)(cid:52) 1 − p + (cid:52) 1 − (cid:140)(cid:53)b(cid:53) + (cid:145)(cid:52) 1 − p + (cid:52) 1 − (cid:139)(cid:53)b(cid:53) = 1 − p + (cid:135)b(cid:49) with (cid:135) ≡ (cid:52) 1 − (cid:140)(cid:53)(cid:52) 1 − (cid:145)(cid:53) + (cid:52) 1 − (cid:139)(cid:53)(cid:145)(cid:48) ( 4 ) Solving for p , inverse demand is p = 1 + (cid:135)b − q(cid:48) ( 5 ) With N symmetric ﬁrms in the market , aggregate demand is q = (cid:80) Nj = 1 q j , and q / N is the demand faced by one ﬁrm . Firm proﬁts (cid:231) i are given by the number of units sold by ﬁrm i , q i , times the proﬁt margin , given by price p minus marginal cost of production (cid:157) , and minus the cost of y innovation projects : (cid:231) i = (cid:52)p − (cid:157)(cid:53)q i − (cid:138)y 2 (cid:49) (cid:138) > 0 (cid:49) ( 6 ) where we assume diminishing returns to running y projects . To maximize proﬁts , ﬁrms make several interrelated decisions in the following sequence : First , they decide on the organization of their R & D . Speciﬁcally , they pick one of two options available to them : the orga - nization of R & D such that user and producer inputs , T and Y , are substitutes ( (cid:130) > 1 ) or the organization for complementarity ( 0 < (cid:130) < 1 ) . It will take ﬁrms longer to change their organizational structure and capabilities in R & D than to change the number of projects , which is why we model this as the ﬁrst choice . Next , the ﬁrms pick their total number of R & D - related projects ( y ) . Then they decide on the share of projects ( 1 − s ) to allocate to traditional producer R & D . The remainder of the projects , share s , will be devoted to user - innovation support and thus indirectly increase the ﬂow of new product ideas available to the ﬁrm . Finally , ﬁrms decide on the quantity to produce and sell on the market ( q i ) . We use backward induction to derive the producers’ optimal decisions . In this section , we look at the optimal choices of q i , s , and y , in this order . In § 4 . 7 , we will study the choice of innovation mode ( (cid:130) ) . 4 . 5 . 1 . Choice of q i . We take the derivative of ( 6 ) with regard to output quantity ( q i ) and obtain the ﬁrst - order condition ( foc ) : 1 + (cid:135)b − (cid:157) − (cid:80) Nj = 1 q j − q i = 0 . In symmetric equilibrium , this produces proﬁt - maximizing quantity , price , and proﬁts , respectively : q i = (cid:52) 1 + (cid:135)b − (cid:157)(cid:53) / (cid:52)N + 1 (cid:53)(cid:49) ( 7a ) p = (cid:52) 1 + (cid:135)b − (cid:157)(cid:53) / (cid:52)N + 1 (cid:53) + (cid:157)(cid:49) ( 7b ) (cid:231) i = (cid:52)p − (cid:157)(cid:53) 2 − (cid:138)y 2 = (cid:54)(cid:52) 1 + (cid:135)b − (cid:157)(cid:53) / (cid:52)N + 1 (cid:53)(cid:55) 2 − (cid:138)y 2 (cid:48) ( 7c ) D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 18 . 51 . 1 . 88 ] on 06 J u l y 2016 , a t 07 : 52 .

Gambardella , Raasch , and von Hippel : The User Innovation Paradigm 10 Management Science , Articles in Advance , pp . 1 – 19 , ©2016 INFORMS 4 . 5 . 2 . Choice of s . To determine the share of the ﬁrms’ projects aimed at supporting user innovation , s , we maximize ˜ b yielding foc (cid:146) (cid:130) (cid:130)s (cid:130) − 1 − (cid:130)(cid:142) (cid:130) (cid:52) 1 − s(cid:53) (cid:130) − 1 = 0 . To determine the optimal s , a case distinction is required . In the case of complementarity between user efforts and producer R & D , i . e . , if 0 < (cid:130) < 1 , the second - order condition ( soc ) is negative , which implies that there is an intermediate project allocation 0 < s < 1 to user support that maximizes innovation output ˜ b ( speciﬁcally , s = (cid:146) (cid:136) / (cid:52)(cid:142) (cid:136) + (cid:146) (cid:136) (cid:53) , with (cid:136) ≡ (cid:130) / (cid:52) 1 − (cid:130)(cid:53)(cid:53) . As can be seen from the expression for (cid:146) , this optimal project share allocated to user innovation support increases in the share of innovating users in the market and their productivity in terms of commercially valuable ideas ( s (cid:145) (cid:49)s (cid:131) > 0 , where from now on we use subscripts to denote derivatives ) , and decreases with the productivity of producer R & D ( s (cid:142) < 0 ) . In the case of substitution between user and producer innovation efforts , i . e . , if (cid:130) > 1 , the soc is positive , which implies that the optimal allocation to user support , s , is either 0 or 1 , depending on whether the productivity of the user contribution in ˜ b , that is (cid:146) , is greater or smaller than the productivity of the ﬁrm contribution , (cid:142) . 4 . 5 . 3 . Choice of y . The foc of ( 7c ) with respect to y is 2 (cid:52) 1 + (cid:135)b − (cid:157)(cid:53)(cid:135) ˜ b / (cid:52)N + 1 (cid:53) 2 − 2 (cid:138) y = 0 , which yields y = (cid:52) 1 − (cid:157)(cid:53)z / (cid:54)(cid:138)(cid:52)N + 1 (cid:53) 2 − z 2 (cid:55) , where z ≡ (cid:135) ˜ b . Note that the soc implies (cid:138)(cid:52)N + 1 (cid:53) 2 − z 2 > 0 such that the proﬁt - maximizing investment y is always positive . It is also easy to see that y increases with z . 4 . 6 . The Producer vs . User - Augmented Innovation Modes From our ﬁndings from the previous section relating to the distribution of innovation projects by the ﬁrm ( s ) , we see that there are two modes of innovating and that ﬁrms will want to choose between them . The ﬁrst mode is characterized by (cid:130) > 1 and s = 0 . That is , in this mode ﬁrms choose to organize their R & D such that user and producer efforts are substitute inputs and then allocate their entire budget to their own commercial R & D efforts , not supporting user innovation activities in any way . We call this the producer ( P ) innovation mode . In this mode , ﬁrms ignore the innovating users and organize the creation of b solely around closed commercial R & D . As a consequence of being closed , ﬁrms need not fear information spillovers to innovating users ( (cid:139) = 0 ) and on to noninnovating users ( (cid:140) = 0 ) . In the producer mode , therefore , the demands of the noninnovating users and the innovating users simplify to v − p + b + (cid:140) (cid:48) h ≥ (cid:140) (cid:48) h ( 8 ) and v − p + b + h ≥ h(cid:49) ( 8’ ) respectively . At the same time , aggregate demand is ( 4 ) , with (cid:135) = 1 rather than (cid:52) 1 − (cid:140)(cid:53)(cid:52) 1 − (cid:145)(cid:53) + (cid:52) 1 − (cid:139)(cid:53)(cid:145) . The second innovation mode is characterized by the ﬁrm organizing its R & D for complementarity with user innovators ( 0 < (cid:130) < 1 ) and then making a positive investment in user innovation support ( optimal s = (cid:146) (cid:136) / (cid:52)(cid:142) (cid:136) + (cid:146) (cid:136) (cid:53) > 0 ) . We call this the user - augmented (cid:52)U(cid:53) mode . In this mode , ﬁrms actively leverage user - created spillovers for innovation and organize their R & D to exploit the complementarity between the two sources of innovation . Users contribute to raising the use value b of the product , which enhances the demand of both the noninnovating users and the innovating users . At the same time , ﬁrms’ support of innovating users creates user contestability with regard to features b (cid:52)(cid:139)(cid:49)(cid:140) ≥ 0 (cid:53) . To summarize , the trade - off between the U versus P modes pivots on producers investing to facilitate user innovation and reap spillovers but , by this action , simultaneously and unavoidably boosting user self - provisioning to a degree that may be small or large . 4 . 7 . Choice of Innovation Mode (cid:52)(cid:130)(cid:53) Continuing our earlier process of backward induction to understand outcomes in markets with innovating users , we now consider the very ﬁrst producer decision , the choice of innovation mode . Our goal is to under - stand under what conditions a producer will prefer the producer mode over the user - augmented mode , or vice versa . Additionally , and importantly , we examine under what conditions the increasing prevalence of innovating users that we observe in many markets ( cf . Baldwin and von Hippel 2011 ) renders user inte - gration the proﬁt - maximizing innovation strategy for producers . Our ﬁrst theorem below explains the choice of inno - vation mode by a producer ﬁrm . It establishes that , subject to two conditions , ﬁrms in markets with an increasing share of innovating users will ﬁnd it in their own best interest to switch to the user - augmented mode . In switching , ﬁrms are aware that they are strengthening user contestability , but they also real - ize that , overall , this is more proﬁtable than a closed innovation approach . To ﬁnd the proﬁt - maximizing mode of innovation , it is convenient to rewrite expression ( 7c ) for the proﬁts of the ﬁrms as (cid:231) = (cid:54)(cid:52) 1 + zy − (cid:157)(cid:53) / (cid:52)N + 1 (cid:53)(cid:55) 2 − (cid:138)y 2 (cid:48) ( 9 ) This expression captures proﬁts in both the P and U modes , which differ only in z . ( In particular , in the P mode , z P = (cid:135) P ˜ b P , with (cid:135) P = 1 and ˜ b P = (cid:142) ; in the U mode , z U = (cid:135) U ˜ b U , with (cid:135) U = (cid:52) 1 − (cid:140)(cid:53)(cid:52) 1 − (cid:145)(cid:53) + (cid:52) 1 − (cid:139)(cid:53)(cid:145) and ˜ b = (cid:52)(cid:142) (cid:136) + (cid:146) (cid:136) (cid:53) 1 / (cid:136) . ) Given the optimal choices of s and y , as derived in § 4 . 5 , this implies that (cid:231) P ≥ (cid:231) U if and only if z P ≥ z U .

We ﬁnd that when there are very few innovating users ( (cid:145) close to zero ) , proﬁts in the P mode are always higher than proﬁts in the U mode ( (cid:231) P > (cid:231) U ) . Thus , when there are very few innovating users , ﬁrms choose the P mode . The intuition is that from the ﬁrms’ perspective , the user innovation spillovers that they can harvest , the upside of conducting projects x to support user innovation , are low . At the same time , the downside is considerable , as the information and tools that the ﬁrms supplies to the few innovating users can enable innovating users to develop a competing design and share it peer to peer , knocking off a good part of the producer’s demand . The magnitude of this loss , and thus the downside of switching to the U mode , will depend on (cid:139) and (cid:140) , users’ ability to self - provision b . As the share of innovating users increases , proﬁts stay the same in the P mode but increase in the U mode . ( This is true under two conditions that we will explain below . ) Firms will switch from the P to the U mode when the share of innovating users is larger than a threshold (cid:145) ∗ , beyond which (cid:231) U > (cid:231) P . This is illustrated in Figure 2 . The ﬁrst condition relates to (cid:139) and (cid:140) . When user con - testability is very weak ( as indicated by the uppermost curve for which (cid:139) = (cid:140) = 0 ) , the producer can switch to the user - augmented mode free of risk . On this curve , when the share of innovating users is (cid:145) = 0 , proﬁts are equal for both modes of innovating . Then , as (cid:145) increases , the U mode outpaces the P mode in terms of ﬁrm proﬁts . Intuitively , in this case ﬁrms beneﬁt from the contribution of innovating users without risking the rise of self - provisioning and concomitant reduction of demand for the ﬁrms’ product . When user contestability is more pronounced ( as illustrated by the second and third curves ) , we see that the threshold (cid:145) ∗ at which the switch to the U mode can occur shifts to the right ; that is , a higher share of innovating users in the market is needed for the producer to prefer the U mode . If spillovers (cid:139) or (cid:140) are very large , as illustrated Figure 2 Firms’ Proﬁts Under the U and P Modes Π P , Π U (cid:1) = (cid:2) = 0 Lower (cid:1) or (cid:2) Π U Π p (cid:3) (cid:3) 1 * (cid:3) 3 * (cid:3) 2 * 1 by the bottom curve , a switch to the U mode will never be attractive to ﬁrms . The second necessary condition for the switch to occur is that the complementarity between user and producer efforts T and Y must be strong enough . Speciﬁcally , (cid:136) < 1 ( i . e . , 0 < (cid:130) < 12 ) must hold . 1 In other words , the contribution of the innovating users must be strong enough to trigger a signiﬁcant increase in b that outweighs the negative impact on proﬁts from intensiﬁed user contestability ; otherwise , ﬁrms will prefer to stay in the producer mode . Theorem ( Choice of Mode ) . If the innovative contri - bution of the innovating users is sizable ( 0 < (cid:130) < 12 ) and user contestability ( (cid:139) and (cid:140) ) is not too high , a critical mass of innovating users ( (cid:145) > (cid:145) ∗ ) makes proﬁt - maximizing ﬁrms prefer the user - augmented mode of innovating to the producer mode . Proof . See Appendix A . It should be noted that whereas ﬁrms may ﬁnd it proﬁtable to switch to the U mode at threshold (cid:145) ∗ , they may switch back again to the P mode at a high (cid:145) . ( As illustrated in Figure 2 , (cid:231) U reaches a maximum and then declines , potentially even falling below the (cid:231) P line . ) This is particularly likely at higher levels of (cid:139) and (cid:140) ( cf . Figure 2 ) . The reason is the following : by our assumption of (cid:139) ≥ (cid:140) , innovating users are more capable than noninnovating users of self - provisioning ; i . e . , they exhibit a superior outside option and thus lower demand for the product of the ﬁrm . When the share of innovating users (cid:145) gets quite large , this not only means extensive user innovation spillovers to ﬁrms but also implies that the share of noninnovating users—those who beneﬁt the most from these spillovers by getting to buy a superior product—is small . Having many innovating users implies having low demand , particularly if (cid:139) is large . This detracts from the attrac - tiveness of the U mode and may make ﬁrms prefer to switch back to the P mode where they can better capture demand . We will leave this issue for future research to investigate in more detail , since our core objective is to understand the initial switch from the producer mode to the user - augmented mode when the prevalence of innovating users increases . 4 . 8 . Welfare and Policy In this ﬁnal section , we consider the welfare impli - cations of ﬁrms choosing either to “go it alone” in 1 The ratio of the marginal products of b = (cid:52) T (cid:130) + Y (cid:130) (cid:53) 1 / (cid:130) with respect to T and Y is equal to (cid:52)Y / T(cid:53) 1 − (cid:130) . With (cid:145) small , T is small , and therefore Y / T is likely to be larger than 1 . As a result , a lower (cid:130) makes the impact of T on b higher relative to the impact of Y on b . Since a higher (cid:145) makes T higher and Y lower because the optimal s increases , the condition 0 < (cid:130) < 12 says that the contribution of the higher T on b has to be strong enough to compensate by a sizable amount the negative effect on b because of a lower Y .

Gambardella , Raasch , and von Hippel : The User Innovation Paradigm 12 Management Science , Articles in Advance , pp . 1 – 19 , ©2016 INFORMS the producer mode of innovating or to integrate user inputs in the user - augmented mode . We need to under - stand whether ﬁrms’ choice of mode is efﬁcient from a societal perspective and , if not , whether policy is likely to improve economic outcomes . Calculations of social welfare that include user inno - vation are different from the standard mode of calculat - ing welfare . Conventionally , social welfare is calculated as proﬁts ( PS ) plus consumer surplus ( CS ) . When innovating users develop and build a new product for their own use , welfare calculations must be modiﬁed to include their full costs and beneﬁts . In particular , we need to take into account their tinkering surplus TS , which is the aggregate net beneﬁt that all users gain from self - provisioning , if they choose to do so . To give an example , if a user self - provisions a newly designed product at a cost of 10 dollars and receives a monetized use value of 30 dollars , her tinkering surplus equals 20 dollars . Recall that beneﬁts to tinkering can also accrue in the form of process value ( Franke and Schreier 2010 , Raasch and von Hippel 2013 ) , e . g . , enjoyment of or learning from the innovation process itself , or social status in the user community . Our model is agnostic to the composition of these beneﬁts . It only presumes them not to be proﬁt based , in line with the deﬁnition of a user innovator . We will consider generalizations of this aspect in the Discussion section . Incorporating these considerations , then , welfare in markets containing both user and producer innovators should be computed as W = PS + CS + TS(cid:49) ( 10 ) where PS and CS are the standard producer , and consumer surplus and TS are the tinkering surplus . How signiﬁcant is the omission of the tinkering surplus in conventional analyses ? The answer depends on the extent of user self - provisioning in a market . If many users self - provision ( as is common across an increasing range of markets , especially markets for digital products ; cf . Baldwin and von Hippel 2011 ) , the omission can be substantial . In some cases , it may dwarf traditional components of welfare . In our model , the tinkering surplus for a user innova - tor equals h , whereas for noninnovating users , it is (cid:140) (cid:48) h , which stems from their ability to tap into peer - to - peer diffusion from the innovating users . Computing the components of welfare as they accrue to producers ( aggregate proﬁts , PS ) , noninnovating users ( consumer surplus , CS nui plus tinkering surplus TS nui ) , and inno - vating users ( CS ui plus tinkering surplus , TS ui (cid:53) , we have PS = N (cid:231)(cid:49) CS nui + TS nui = (cid:52) 1 − (cid:145)(cid:53)(cid:54)(cid:52) 1 − p + (cid:52) 1 − (cid:140)(cid:53)b(cid:53) 2 / 2 + (cid:140)b + (cid:140) (cid:48) h(cid:55)(cid:49) CS ui + TS ui = (cid:145)(cid:54)(cid:52) 1 − p + (cid:52) 1 − (cid:139)(cid:53)b(cid:53) 2 / 2 + (cid:139)b + h(cid:55)(cid:48) The ﬁrst term is the aggregate proﬁt of all the pro - ducers . The second term is the aggregate surplus of all noninnovating users , calculated from (cid:52) 1 − (cid:145)(cid:53) (cid:20)(cid:90) 1 p − (cid:52) 1 − (cid:140)(cid:53)b (cid:52)v − p + b + (cid:140) (cid:48) h(cid:53)dv + (cid:90) p − (cid:52) 1 − (cid:140)(cid:53)b 0 (cid:52)(cid:140)b + (cid:140) (cid:48) h(cid:53)dv (cid:21) (cid:48) The third term derives from (cid:145) (cid:20)(cid:90) 1 p − (cid:52) 1 − (cid:139)(cid:53)b (cid:54)v − p + b + h(cid:55)dv + (cid:90) p − (cid:52) 1 − (cid:139)(cid:53)b 0 (cid:52)(cid:139)b + h(cid:53)dv (cid:21) (cid:48) These expressions will differ , depending on whether the U mode or the P mode is being chosen by ﬁrms . Our analysis of welfare produces two main results that we summarize in two theorems . The ﬁrst theorem states that , given our condition 0 < (cid:130) < 12 , higher ﬁrm proﬁts in the U mode imply higher welfare in the U mode , but the reverse is not true . That is , whenever ﬁrms’ proﬁts are higher in the U mode , welfare is aligned ; by contrast , when ﬁrms’ proﬁts are higher in the P mode , welfare may not be aligned . Speciﬁcally , there are levels of (cid:145) , the share of innovating users in a market , such that proﬁts are higher in the P mode but welfare is higher in the U mode . As a result , to the extent that the decision to switch belongs to the producers , as we modeled it , producers will remain in the P mode even though the share of innovating users is substantial and social welfare would be better served in the U mode . The reason is that ﬁrms do not internalize the key externalities of our model—that is , the increase in tinkering surplus ( h ) accruing to users because of ﬁrms’ investment in user support ( x ) and also facilitation of self - provisioning that ﬁrms bestow on innovating users ( (cid:139)b ) and , subsequently , noninnovating users ( (cid:140)b ) even if they do not buy the product . Theorem ( Welfare ) . Under the conditions of the choice - of - mode theorem , if ﬁrms’ proﬁts are higher in the user - augmented mode , so is welfare , but the reverse is not true . Proof . See Appendix B . Our second result regards policy . We show that policies that increase the productivity of innovating users can never reduce welfare , provided that the costs of such policies do not outweigh their beneﬁts . By contrast , policies that increase the productivity of R & D within ﬁrms may reduce welfare . Examples of policies that raise the productivity of innovating users , (cid:131) , are subsidized access to design tools and maker - spaces . If innovating users become more productive , both proﬁts and welfare rise under the U mode but not under the P mode , which , after all , does not leverage users’ productivity . As ﬁrms’ proﬁts in the U mode increase , they may come to exceed proﬁts in the P mode . We know from the D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 18 . 51 . 1 . 88 ] on 06 J u l y 2016 , a t 07 : 52 . F o r p e r s on a l u s e on l y , a ll r i gh t s r e s e r v e d . Gambardella , Raasch , and von Hippel : The User Innovation Paradigm Management Science , Articles in Advance , pp . 1 – 19 , ©2016 INFORMS 13 previous theorem that if proﬁts are higher in the U mode , welfare is also higher . Policies that increase the productivity of producer R & D , (cid:142) , include R & D subsidies and tax exemptions as well as publicly funded applied R & D . Increases in ﬁrms’ research productivity (cid:142) raise proﬁts in both the P and the U modes . We show that , unless complementarity between user and producer efforts is high , increases in (cid:142) induce a larger increase in proﬁts in the P mode than in the U mode . 2 This means that policies that support traditional producer R & D may induce a switch back to the P mode . Since welfare is sometimes lower in the P mode even while ﬁrms prefer it , increases in (cid:142) may render the P mode more attractive to the ﬁrms in spite of the fact that welfare is higher in the U mode . In other words , such increases may induce a switch to the P mode even though welfare is higher in the U mode , or they may prevent a welfare - increasing switch to the U mode . To summarize , policies that support producer innova - tion productivity (cid:142) may reduce welfare . The mechanism is that such policies encourage ﬁrms to adopt a closed producer innovation mode , whereas welfare may be higher in an open user - augmented mode . By contrast , policies that support the productivity of the innovating users can never reduce welfare . This is because they can only encourage a switch to the U mode , and this is never welfare reducing because whenever ﬁrms prefer the U mode welfare is higher in this mode . Theorem ( Policy ) . Under the conditions of the choice - of - mode theorem , policies that raise the productivity of innovating users , (cid:131) , encourage ﬁrms to adopt the user - augmented mode and can never reduce welfare . By contrast , if the complementarity between user and producer innovation activities , T and Y , is weak ( (cid:130) > (cid:130) ∗ , with (cid:130) ∗ < 1 / 2 ) , policies that raise ﬁrms’ research productivity , (cid:142) , encourage ﬁrms to adopt the producer innovation mode , which may reduce welfare . Proof . See Appendix C . 5 . Discussion In this paper we analyzed the effects of user innovation by consumers on standard outcomes in markets for innovation . Our special focus was on understanding the implications of the increasing prevalence of innovating 2 The intuition is that increases in (cid:142) have a direct positive impact on Y in both the P and U modes . In addition , in the U mode , increases in (cid:142) reduce s , which raises Y and reduces T . However , a higher (cid:130) generates a more pronounced drop in s relative to ( 1 − s ) because when complementarity is strong , the increase in Y does not produce a strong decline in T as a result of the feedback produced by complementarity . As a result , when complementarity is weak , increases in (cid:142) produce a stronger increase in b in the P than in the U mode . users ( (cid:145) increasing from a low level ) , as found in many markets . Our principal ﬁndings were three . First , as the share of innovating users in a market increases beyond a certain threshold , ﬁrms’ proﬁt - maximizing strategy is to switch from the traditional producer - only innovation approach to an innovation mode that harnesses user innovators . Subject to two intuitive conditions relating to the innovative and competitive impact of user activities , welfare is higher in this user - augmented mode than in traditional producer - only innovation mode . All of the constituencies—producers , innovating users , and noninnovating users—beneﬁt . Second , any ﬁrm that elects to switch to integrating innovating users deﬁnitely augments social welfare , but ﬁrms generally switch too late . Thus , markets containing both user and producer innovators tend to fall short of their theoretical optimum in terms of value creation because producers are too slow , from a social welfare perspective , to embrace user innovation . Thus , producers’ optimal R & D strategies yield a suboptimal division of innovative labor between users and producers at the societal level . Underlying this inefﬁciency are externalities that the producer cannot capture , e . g . , the tinkering surplus that accrues to users , a novel component of social welfare . Third , policies that raise the productivity of inno - vating users encourage ﬁrms to switch to the user - augmented mode and can never reduce welfare . By contrast , policies that raise ﬁrms’ research productiv - ity encourage ﬁrms to switch back to the traditional producer - innovation mode and thereby may reduce welfare . 5 . 1 . Assumptions , Robustness , and Generalizability of Findings Our model rests on several assumptions that can be usefully investigated via further research . First , as we mentioned at the start of the paper , innovating users are deﬁned as individuals or ﬁrms developing innovations to use rather than sell . In this paper , we have focused on individual consumer innova - tors only . We have done this to highlight the contestable nature of their demand and to emphasize that con - testability can occur in markets for consumer goods . However , follow - on research could develop a similar model focused on or including user ﬁrms creating , for example , process innovations for their own use rather than for sale . Second , we note that there are ﬁelds and markets in which some types of innovations originate only from innovating users—a situation with s = 1 in terms of our model . This is often the case , for example , with respect to the development of specialized techniques . Producers often ﬁnd it impossible to proﬁtably develop and market unprotectable techniques , and they tend D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 18 . 51 . 1 . 88 ] on 06 J u l y 2016 , a t 07 : 52 . F o r p e r s on a l u s e on l y , a ll r i gh t s r e s e r v e d . Gambardella , Raasch , and von Hippel : The User Innovation Paradigm 14 Management Science , Articles in Advance , pp . 1 – 19 , ©2016 INFORMS to leave that vital arena entirely or almost entirely to users ( Hienerth 2016 ) . In this paper we explored the importance of user innovation in markets that include producer innovation as well . However , further work could explore the nature of markets characterized by user innovation only . Third , for simplicity , our model assumed that all innovating users will be able to beneﬁt from a pro - ducer’s investment in user innovation support and that the producer will be able to observe the efforts of all innovating users and be able to reap any valuable spillovers . This is clearly not the case in practice—users will be differentially affected , and producers will not be able to observe or capture all spillovers generated by users . However , the same modeling logic and the same ﬁndings apply if our assumptions are true only for a subset of users . Fourth , we assume that producers can choose the level of investment in support of innovating users that will maximize their proﬁts . In the real world , users are independent actors who often have power to “push back” against producer plans and actions . They also can initiate user innovation activities in ways that producers do not expect . An example of investment in supporting user innovation not going according to producers’ proﬁt - maximizing plans is the case of Xara , a proprietary software company . In 2006 , Xara invested in opening a large percentage of the source code of Xara Xtreme , a vector graphics package , as a way to invite user innovation . However , Xara did not open a small , commercially critical part of the source code . This omission caused a boycott among user programmers , and in the end , Xara yielded and opened more of the code than it would have preferred absent pressure from innovating users ( Willis 2007 ) . It would be valuable and interesting for follow - on research to address situations such as the above . Whereas in this paper we assumed that producers decide unilaterally to what extent they want to support and complement user innovation activities , we could think of a game in which innovating users can possess the power to determine the extent of user support , s , and potentially even the degree of complementarity , (cid:130) . We expect that , in such a game , when the power to make both decisions lies with innovating users , they will pick higher levels of user support and complemen - tarity than producers would . Unless users pick very high levels of s , this should lower producer proﬁt but increase welfare overall . Future research could further explore this and also consider situations in which the decision power with regard to s and (cid:130) is distributed between innovating users and producers . Fifth , it is noteworthy that user innovators in our model receive no remuneration from producer ﬁrms . In the real world , successful user innovators sometimes receive payments for valuable contributions ( such is the case with Lego and many app stores ) . Still , as a nationally representative survey in Finland shows , innovating users typically do freely reveal their innova - tions ; our assumption of no payment is based on that situation ( de Jong et al . 2015 ) . In a different model , our variable x could be seen as the cost of user royalties to the ﬁrm , and implications for market outcomes could be explored . Sixth , we have modeled producer support of user innovation as increasing the amount of time ( or resources more generally ) that users wish to spend on activities that beneﬁt producers . Gamiﬁcation of contributions and the setting up of a user community were examples in point . It is also conceivable , however , that producer support , e . g . , in the form of better tools , will enable users to save time while innovating . Such kinds of producer support could attract additional users to contribute , i . e . , those who were previously noninnovators . This would endogenize the share of user innovators , (cid:145) , in a market , which we have taken to be exogenous in our model . It would be interesting for future research to explore the outcomes of this extended model , especially with regard to the optimal choice of producer strategy (cid:130) . Finally , our model treated all producers symmetrically , having all of them choose either a user - substituting or a user - complementing innovation strategy . Future research can usefully generalize from this limiting assumption . In the real world , we observe the coexis - tence of producers of both types . A key reason , we think , is that reorganizing and restructuring R & D to exploit user - created innovation spillovers can be quite costly . Established ﬁrms with a legacy of producer - centric innovation will , therefore , be hesitant to switch , whereas new entrants without a commitment to the traditional model will likely ﬁnd it economically more viable to choose the user - augmented innovation mode . Such constraints and switching costs could usefully be analyzed regarding their effects on strategic heterogene - ity and ﬁrm - and market - level outcomes . For instance , in markets with a growing share of user innovators , we should observe that new entrants and incumbents that are more ﬂexible in organizing their R & D are more proﬁtable . 5 . 2 . Implications for Theory It has been argued , on the basis of theoretical and empirical literature on user innovation , that we are in the middle of a paradigm shift . User innovation has moved from being considered an anomaly to being recognized as a new paradigm that challenges and extends our traditional view of innovation ( von Hippel 2005 , Baldwin and von Hippel 2011 ) . Both theory building and empirical research are needed to marry the two paradigms and build a new and consistent structure . Our general objective in this paper has been to contribute to this major task . More speciﬁcally , D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 18 . 51 . 1 . 88 ] on 06 J u l y 2016 , a t 07 : 52 . F o r p e r s on a l u s e on l y , a ll r i gh t s r e s e r v e d . Gambardella , Raasch , and von Hippel : The User Innovation Paradigm Management Science , Articles in Advance , pp . 1 – 19 , ©2016 INFORMS 15 this paper contributes to theory building in several important ways . Our paper leverages standard welfare economics with externalities to analytically capture and analyze the paradigm shift in innovation toward user and open innovation . We explore the nature of these externalities and ﬁnd they have strategic implications : companies can raise proﬁts by producing more externalities , even though they cannot capture them in full . Our model also produces results , such as the policy theorem , which are not straightforward based on standard welfare economics . It yields novel testable predictions , e . g . , about the level of producer investment in support of user innovation and about the relationship between the share of innovating users and producer proﬁts . Future research should assess these predictions empirically and identify additional contingency factors . While deriving these insights , we found that con - ventional concepts were not sufﬁcient for the analysis of markets containing innovating users . Conventional microeconomics does not conceive of individual con - sumers as a source of innovation and production . Our distinction of four pure types of user – producer inter - actions in innovation translates central aspects of the richness of real - world user – producer phenomena into a language that supports strategic analysis . We devel - oped new concepts such as user - contested demand and tinkering surplus . In markets with user innovation and self - provisioning , tinkering surplus constitutes a third component of social welfare , next to proﬁts and consumer surplus . Future studies can adopt and further develop these concepts to analyze ﬁrm strategizing and outcomes in markets where users are a major source of innovation and atomistic demand - side production . Overall , our paper advances the concept of a division of labor in innovation between users and producers . We ﬁnd that more labor shifted to users than producers would ﬁnd optimal maximizes value creation in mar - kets for innovation . If users’ capabilities to innovate are expanding in many industries , as has been argued ( Baldwin and von Hippel 2011 ) , innovation tasks can and should increasingly be shifted to the demand side . Our ﬁndings also elucidate the boundaries for pro - ducers to invest in such a division of innovative labor with users . Its viability from the producer’s perspec - tive is partly exogenous , determined by technological conditions as well as the characteristics of innovating users in the market , and partly endogenous to the producer’s own decision making . Through their own investment in specialization and complementarity with users , producers can , and may , ﬁnd it in their own best interest to partly outsource innovation to users . 5 . 3 . Implications for Policy It is increasingly clear that the world signiﬁcantly contains user innovation as well as producer innova - tion . We have shown that , in such a world , synergies with users yield a superior outcome from a welfare point of view . This now becomes a clear opportunity compared to the traditional producer - centric innovation world . There is reason , we argue , to review existing policies that assume producer innovation only and to develop new innovation policies that incorporate an understanding of both user and producer innovation . Our model tells us that ﬁve aspects particularly require new policy measures . First , we have found that producers choose R & D strategies that are too conser - vative , from a welfare point of view , with insufﬁcient specialization and complementarity with innovating users ( choice of (cid:130) in our model ) . The reason is that part of the value generated by their investment slips to users in the form of tinkering surplus and higher consumer surplus ( two externalities ) . New policy measures can be designed to address these failures . We showed that such policy measures could never reduce welfare ( provided they are effective ) and would often increase it . Second , policy measures supporting ﬁrm investment should be designed to distinguish carefully between investments that complement and substitute for user innovation activities . They should favor a division of labor between users and producers and seek to support users and producers each in what they do best . Our model shows that public incentives for corporate R & D can reduce welfare if they cause ﬁrms to be less open to innovating users . Such policies can crowd out ﬁrm support of user innovation and keep ﬁrms in the producer - only innovation mode . Third , for historical reasons , producers are likely to mostly possess R & D capabilities and beliefs ( (cid:130) in our model ) that support go - it - alone innovation programs rather than programs designed to complement user innovation such as user tool kits and employment of personnel who know how to effectively interact with innovating users . This raises the question whether ﬁrms would quickly switch to complementary technologies as innovating users start populating their markets or could be stuck in a substitution equilibrium . Our model shows that the share of innovating users in a market and their productivity from the producers perspective have to be signiﬁcant for producers to change their R & D strategy and begin to collaborate with innovative users . If ﬁrms are stuck in an inferior equilibrium , temporary policy measures to reduce producers’ switching costs to the welfare - superior strategy of complementing user innovation could be valuable . Fourth , our ﬁndings suggest that policy measures directed at elevating the share of innovating users ( (cid:145) in our model ) will increase welfare even further . This is true until the welfare - maximizing share of innovating users in the market is reached ( which , as we show , is clearly greater than 0 ) : if a market has too few or too many , either it does not have enough production of valuable spillovers or does not have D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 18 . 51 . 1 . 88 ] on 06 J u l y 2016 , a t 07 : 52 .

Gambardella , Raasch , and von Hippel : The User Innovation Paradigm 16 Management Science , Articles in Advance , pp . 1 – 19 , ©2016 INFORMS enough noninnovating users that beneﬁt from them , and thus welfare is not optimized . In essence , in a world with synergistic investments of ﬁrms and users , you need both innovating users and noninnovating users who beneﬁt from their efforts to maximize wel - fare . Although everyone , including producers , would gain from measures that turn noninnovating users into innovating users up to the levels described above , pro - ducers may nonetheless not undertake such measures on their own . The types of investments required often have the character of investment in a public good , which typically results in private underinvestment . They involve education , easy access to cheap design creation , sharing and production technologies , and the promotion of a “maker culture” ( Baldwin and von Hippel 2011 ) . Finally , our ﬁndings emphasize that the impact of users on market outcomes hinge on users having access to innovation design and self - production technologies that are economically viable from their perspective . This brings rapidly improving user production capabilities into the limelight of future research and policy . Whereas the extant literature investigates the antecedents of user design creation in some detail , user self - provisioning has received much less attention ( cf . Kleer and Piller 2013 ) . Our analysis highlights that the creation of innovative designs is not sufﬁcient for the existence of user - contested and user - complemented markets ; self - provisioning is also required . 5 . 4 . Implications for Producer Firms As noted earlier , the range of innovation opportunities where single and collaborative user innovation is viable is steadily increasing ( Baldwin and von Hippel 2011 ) . This means that the user contestability of many markets will increase , as will users’ ability to create design spillovers and complements to producer products . Our ﬁndings imply that , because of these techno - logical and societal shifts , producers should carefully observe market trends to understand if or when their markets will reach the tipping point beyond which the user - augmented innovation mode is their proﬁt - maximizing strategy . Recall that our ﬁndings show that when the share of user innovators in a market reaches a certain threshold , producers increase their proﬁts by leveraging user innovators , as long as the share of users contesting the producer market does not get very high and the contestability , (cid:139) in our model , does not get too strong . The switch from a producer - centric , user - substituting R & D strategy to user - complementing R & D involves a major reorganization of R & D functions and the development of new capabilities that will derive beneﬁts from valuable user - created spillovers and reduce losses from user self - provisioning of the ﬁrm’s product . Producers are well advised to choose their approach carefully at any given time and to prepare to adjust early on to remain competitive . To illustrate how this can be done , consider how Harley - Davidson Motorcycles invested to capture more proﬁt from the widespread activity of motorcycle customization by consumers . It created websites to enable users to share their designs and learn from each other—and to make the user designs visible to Harley . The user design spillovers are evaluated for commercial potential . To reduce loss from self - provisioning , Harley offers custom production of new bikes according to users’ designs and also offers postproduction parts that can be installed by the user who is customizing a bike he already owns . This enables Harley to capture increased proﬁts from this type of complementary user self - provisioning as well ( Harley - Davidson 2016 ) . As a second illustration , consider that Lego sponsors many events where fans are invited to meet and engage in joint design activities . It also supports fan websites where fans can post their novel constructions made of Lego bricks ( Antorini et al . 2012 ) . The Lego - sponsored website allows Lego to directly observe the popularity of user - created designs in terms of download counts . If a design appears to be very popular , Lego can beneﬁt from the information spillover , build it into a kit product , and sell it to consumers . In both these cases , consumers were innovating , creating complements , and modifying products without company involvement or approval prior to ofﬁcial company responses . The goal of producer investments was then to enhance the beneﬁts the producer obtained from these activities . If ﬁrms learn how to “direct” users better toward the type of innovation activity that is valuable to ﬁrms , value capture by producers increases . To conclude , we began with the observation that theoretical and empirical research now shows that individual users—consumers—are a major and increas - ing source of new products and services . To develop the implications , we built a microeconomic model of a market that incorporates innovation by both users and producers . We think this initial work has shown and analyzed important interactions between the user and producer paradigms . We suggest that further explorations of this topic can provide major new insights into the nature and functioning of markets for innovative products and services .

Moreover , (cid:145) affects (cid:231) only through z , and therefore , we can study the impact of (cid:145) on (cid:231) by studying the impact of (cid:145) on z . We ﬁrst show that at (cid:145) = 0 , z U ≤ z P , which establishes that at (cid:145) = 0 , ﬁrms choose the P mode . We then show that and if 0 < (cid:130) < 12 , z U(cid:145) ≥ z P(cid:145) (cid:49) ∀ (cid:145) < (cid:145) 0 , with (cid:145) 0 < 1 . For the ﬁrst point , compare (cid:135) U ˜ b U with (cid:135) P ˜ b P = (cid:142) . At (cid:145) = 0 , (cid:135) U ≤ (cid:135) P and ˜ b U = ˜ b P = (cid:142) . As a result , (cid:145) = 0 implies z U ≤ z P . For the second point , it is not difﬁcult to see that z P(cid:145) = 0 , and z U(cid:145) = ˜ b U (cid:52)(cid:135) U(cid:145) + (cid:135) U ˜ b U(cid:145) / ˜ b U (cid:53) . Recall that (cid:135) U(cid:145) ≤ 0 , and it is easy to see that ˜ b U(cid:145) / ˜ b U = (cid:146) (cid:136) / (cid:54)(cid:145)(cid:52)(cid:142) (cid:136) + (cid:146) (cid:136) (cid:53)(cid:55) . This expression is positive , and if (cid:136) < 1 or 0 < (cid:130) < 12 , it is very high when (cid:145) → 0 . Moreover , it declines as (cid:145) increases , and , given (cid:139) ≥ (cid:140) , (cid:135) U declines . All this implies that when (cid:145) is close to zero , z U(cid:145) > 0 , because the positive value of (cid:135) U ˜ b U(cid:145) / ˜ b U outweighs the negative (cid:135) U (cid:145) . As (cid:145) increases , z U (cid:145) declines ; that is , z U (cid:145)(cid:145) < 0 . This is because z U(cid:145)(cid:145) = ˜ b U(cid:145) (cid:52)(cid:135) U(cid:145) + (cid:135) U ˜ b U(cid:145) / ˜ b U (cid:53) + ˜ b U (cid:161)(cid:52)(cid:135) U(cid:145) + (cid:135) U ˜ b U(cid:145) / ˜ b U (cid:53) / (cid:161)(cid:145) , where based on what we have just said , the last derivative is negative . Then , when (cid:135) U(cid:145) + (cid:135) U ˜ b U(cid:145) / ˜ b U = 0—that is , z U(cid:145) = 0— z U(cid:145)(cid:145) < 0 , which in turn means that z U reaches a maximum when z U(cid:145) = 0 , and it then starts declining . This explains the shape of our curves in Figure 2 . We have discussed in § 4 . 7 , and it is easy to see that when (cid:145) = (cid:139) = (cid:140) = 0 , then (cid:231) U = (cid:231) P . Then , as (cid:231) U increases faster than (cid:231) P as (cid:145) increases , a higher (cid:145) , with (cid:139) = (cid:140) = 0 , implies (cid:231) U > (cid:231) P . This establishes that a switch can take place if (cid:139) or (cid:140) is sufﬁciently small . Finally , differentiate z U − z P with respect to (cid:139) or (cid:140) at (cid:145) = (cid:145) ∗ . We know that z U(cid:145) − z P(cid:145) > 0 , and therefore , the sign of (cid:145) ∗ (cid:139) or (cid:145) ∗ (cid:140) is the opposite of the sign of z U(cid:139) − z P(cid:139) or z U(cid:140) − z P(cid:140) , which are both negative because (cid:139) and (cid:140) affect these expressions only through (cid:135) U . As a result , (cid:145) ∗ increases with (cid:139) or (cid:140) , and if (cid:139) or (cid:140) is too high , the switch does not take place . Q . E . D . Appendix B . Proof of the Welfare Theorem The strategy to prove this theorem is to show , ﬁrst , that (cid:145) ∗ , W U − W P ≥ 0 and then that W U(cid:145) − W P(cid:145) ≥ 0 . Under the conditions of the choice - of - mode theorem , (cid:231) U(cid:145) ≥ (cid:231) P(cid:145) . This means that at (cid:145) ∗ , when the ﬁrms switch from the P to the U mode , welfare is higher in the U mode , and for larger (cid:145) , welfare does not switch back to the P mode . To show that W U − W P ≥ 0 , evaluate W U − W P = N(cid:52)(cid:231) U − (cid:231) P (cid:53) + (cid:52) 1 − (cid:145)(cid:53) (cid:2) 12 (cid:52) 1 − p U + (cid:52) 1 − (cid:140)(cid:53)b U (cid:53) 2 + (cid:140)b U + (cid:140) (cid:48) h U − 12 (cid:52) 1 − p P + b P (cid:53) 2 − (cid:140) (cid:48) h P (cid:3) + (cid:145) (cid:2) 12 (cid:52) 1 − p U + (cid:52) 1 − (cid:139)(cid:53)b U (cid:53) 2 + (cid:139)b U + h U − 12 (cid:52) 1 − p P + b P (cid:53) 2 − h P (cid:3) at (cid:145) ∗ , where (cid:231) U − (cid:231) P = 0 and z U y U = z P y P , which implies p U = p P and z U = z P . The latter equality implies y U = y P , and therefore (cid:135) U b U = b P . We can rewrite W U − W P at (cid:145) ∗ using all this information , suppressing for simplicity the superscript U , and rearranging terms , W U − W P = (cid:52) 1 − (cid:145)(cid:53) 12 (cid:2) (cid:52) 1 − p + (cid:52) 1 − (cid:140)(cid:53)b(cid:53)(cid:52) 1 − p + b(cid:53) + (cid:140)b(cid:52)p − (cid:52) 1 − (cid:140)(cid:53)b(cid:53) (cid:3) + (cid:145) 12 (cid:2) (cid:52) 1 − p + (cid:52) 1 − (cid:139)(cid:53)b(cid:53)(cid:52) 1 − p + b(cid:53) + (cid:139)b(cid:52)p − (cid:52) 1 − (cid:139)(cid:53)b(cid:53) (cid:3) + 12 (cid:52) 1 − (cid:135)(cid:53)b − 12 (cid:52) 1 − p + (cid:135)b(cid:53) 2 + (cid:2) (cid:52) 1 − (cid:145)(cid:53)(cid:140) (cid:48) + (cid:145) (cid:3) (cid:52)h U − h P (cid:53)(cid:48) The terms in the ﬁrst two square brackets are the number of users who buy times their surplus plus the number of users who do not buy times their surplus . This also explains why 0 ≤ p − (cid:52) 1 − (cid:140)(cid:53)b ≤ 1 and 0 ≤ p − (cid:52) 1 − (cid:139)(cid:53)b ≤ 1 . Beyond these boundaries , the surplus of the noninnovating user is 12 + (cid:140) (cid:48) b or (cid:52)(cid:140) + (cid:140) (cid:48) (cid:53)b and 12 + h or (cid:139)b + h for the innovating users . As a result , (cid:140)b(cid:52)p − (cid:52) 1 − (cid:140)(cid:53)b(cid:53) , (cid:139)b(cid:52)p − (cid:52) 1 − (cid:139)(cid:53)b(cid:53) ≥ 0 , and it is easy to see that h U − h P ≥ 0 . Sum the ﬁrst terms in the ﬁrst two square brackets , weighed , respectively , by (cid:52) 1 − (cid:145)(cid:53) and (cid:145) , and subtract 12 (cid:52) 1 − p + (cid:135)b(cid:53) 2 . This yields 12 (cid:2) (cid:52) 1 − p + b(cid:53)(cid:52) 1 − p + (cid:135)b(cid:53) − (cid:52) 1 − p + (cid:135)b(cid:53)(cid:52) 1 − p + (cid:135)b(cid:53) (cid:3) ≥ 0 because (cid:135) ≤ 1 and 1 − p + (cid:135)b ≥ 0 because (cid:135) is a weighted average between (cid:52) 1 − (cid:140)(cid:53) and (cid:52) 1 − (cid:139)(cid:53) , and (cid:52)p − (cid:52) 1 − (cid:140)(cid:53)b(cid:53) ≥ 0 . Since all the other terms in the expression for W U – W P are nonnegative , this establishes that at (cid:145) ∗ , W U ≥ W P . The next step is to show that W U(cid:145) ≥ W P(cid:145) . The expression for W P is ( 10 ) using the speciﬁc expressions for PS , CS nui , and CS ui , with (cid:139) = (cid:140) = 0 and p , b , and h computed for the P mode , which means that x = 0 , and (cid:135) , ˜ b , and y are obtained from the problem of the ﬁrm under the P mode . It is easy to see that in this case , (cid:145) does not affect (cid:135) , ˜ b , and y , and therefore W P(cid:145) = (cid:52) 1 − (cid:140) (cid:48) (cid:53)h P . For the U mode , W U(cid:145) = N(cid:231) U(cid:145) + (cid:52) 1 − (cid:145)(cid:53) (cid:2) (cid:52) 1 − p + (cid:52) 1 − (cid:140)(cid:53)b(cid:53)(cid:52) − p (cid:145) + (cid:52) 1 − (cid:140)(cid:53)b (cid:145) (cid:53) + (cid:140)b (cid:145) + (cid:140) (cid:48) h U(cid:145) (cid:3) + (cid:145) (cid:2) (cid:52) 1 − p + (cid:52) 1 − (cid:139)(cid:53)b(cid:53)(cid:52) − p (cid:145) + (cid:52) 1 − (cid:139)(cid:53)b (cid:145) (cid:53) + (cid:139)b (cid:145) + h U(cid:145) (cid:3) + (cid:2) (cid:52) 1 − p + (cid:52) 1 − (cid:139)(cid:53)b(cid:53) 2 − (cid:52) 1 − p + (cid:52) 1 − (cid:140)(cid:53)b(cid:53) 2 (cid:3) / 2 + (cid:52)(cid:139) − (cid:140)(cid:53)b + (cid:52) 1 − (cid:140) (cid:48) (cid:53)h U (cid:3) (cid:49) where apart from (cid:231) U(cid:145) and h U , we suppressed all the super - scripts U . If 0 < (cid:130) < 12 and (cid:145) is close to zero , (cid:231) U(cid:145) ≥ 0 . More - over , h U − h P ≥ 0 . Thus , to establish the sign of W U(cid:145) − W P(cid:145) (cid:49) we need to show that all the other terms of the expres - sion for W U(cid:145) are nonnegative . Start with the last term . Rewrite the difference of squares as the product of the sum and difference of the two terms , and collect (cid:52)(cid:139) − (cid:140)(cid:53)b . We obtain (cid:52)(cid:139) − (cid:140)(cid:53)b(cid:52)p − (cid:52) 1 − (cid:52)(cid:139) + (cid:140)(cid:53) / 2 (cid:53)b(cid:53) ≥ 0 , because (cid:139) ≥ (cid:140) and (cid:52)p − (cid:52) 1 − (cid:52)(cid:139) + (cid:140)(cid:53) / 2 (cid:53)b(cid:53) = 12 (cid:52)p − (cid:52) 1 − (cid:139)(cid:53)b + p − (cid:52) 1 − (cid:140)(cid:53)b(cid:53) , and we already established that (cid:52)p − (cid:52) 1 − (cid:140)(cid:53)b(cid:53) , (cid:139)b(cid:52)p − (cid:52) 1 − (cid:139)(cid:53)b(cid:53) ≥ 0 . Finally , (cid:52) 1 − p + (cid:52) 1 − (cid:140)(cid:53)b(cid:53)(cid:52) − p (cid:145) + (cid:52) 1 − (cid:140)(cid:53)b (cid:145) (cid:53) + (cid:140)b (cid:145) = (cid:52) 1 − p + (cid:52) 1 − (cid:140)(cid:53)b(cid:53)(cid:52) − p (cid:145) + b (cid:145) (cid:53) + (cid:140)b (cid:145) (cid:52)p − (cid:52) 1 − (cid:140)(cid:53)b(cid:53) . We know that (cid:52) 1 − p + (cid:52) 1 − (cid:140)(cid:53)b(cid:53) ≥ 0 , (cid:52)p − (cid:52) 1 − (cid:140)(cid:53)b(cid:53) ≥ 0 , and − p (cid:145) + b (cid:145) = − (cid:52)(cid:135) (cid:145) b + (cid:135)b (cid:145) (cid:53) / (cid:52)N + 1 (cid:53) + b (cid:145) = − (cid:135) (cid:145) b / (cid:52)N + 1 (cid:53) + b (cid:145) (cid:54) 1 − (cid:135) / (cid:52)N + 1 (cid:53)(cid:55) ≥ 0 . This is because (cid:135) (cid:145) ≤ 0 , b (cid:145) = ˜ b (cid:145) y + ˜ by (cid:145) ≥ 0 , and 1 − (cid:135) / (cid:52)N + 1 (cid:53) > 0 because (cid:135) ≤ 1 . We obtain a similar result for the analogous term in (cid:139) . This establishes that W U(cid:145) ≥ W P(cid:145) . Q . E . D . Appendix C . Proof of the Policy Theorem Like in the previous theorem , the strategy to prove this theorem hinges on the fact that , as shown in the previous theorem , at (cid:145) ∗ , W U − W P ≥ 0 , and then we study how (cid:231) U − (cid:231) P and W U − W P vary as we change (cid:131) or (cid:142) . The logic is to check whether , under the conditions of the choice - of - mode theorem , changes in (cid:231) U − (cid:231) P and W U − W P go in the same direction . In W U − W P , changes in (cid:131) do not affect any of the variables in the P mode . They raise (cid:231) U and h U . The expression for W U (cid:131) is equivalent to W U (cid:145) in the proof of the previous theorem , without the last two terms and with subscripts (cid:131) instead of D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 18 . 51 . 1 . 88 ] on 06 J u l y 2016 , a t 07 : 52 .

Gambardella , Raasch , and von Hippel : The User Innovation Paradigm 18 Management Science , Articles in Advance , pp . 1 – 19 , ©2016 INFORMS (cid:145) . Thus , to show that W U(cid:131) − W P(cid:131) ≥ 0 , we need to show that the second and third terms are nonnegative . Analogously to the proof of the previous theorem , the second term can be written as (cid:52) 1 − p + (cid:52) 1 − (cid:140)(cid:53)b(cid:53)(cid:52) − p (cid:131) + b (cid:131) (cid:53) + (cid:140)b (cid:131) (cid:52)p − (cid:52) 1 − (cid:140)(cid:53)b(cid:53) . We know that (cid:52) 1 − p + (cid:52) 1 − (cid:140)(cid:53)b(cid:53) ≥ 0 , (cid:52)p − (cid:52) 1 − (cid:140)(cid:53)b(cid:53) ≥ 0 , and − p U(cid:131) + b U(cid:131) = b U(cid:131) (cid:52) 1 − (cid:135) U / (cid:52)N + 1 (cid:53)(cid:53) ≥ 0 (cid:48) The same applies to the third term , which establishes that at (cid:145) ∗ , where (cid:231) U − (cid:231) P = 0 and W U − W P ≥ 0 , W U(cid:131) − W P(cid:131) ≥ 0 . This means that at (cid:145) ∗ increases in (cid:131) raise (cid:231) U beyond (cid:231) P , which induces ﬁrms to switch to the U mode . At the same time , welfare , which at (cid:145) ∗ is higher in the U mode , cannot turn to be smaller than in the P mode . Consider now increases in (cid:142) . We ﬁrst show that if (cid:130) > (cid:130) ∗ with (cid:130) ∗ < 12 , then (cid:231) U(cid:142) − (cid:231) P(cid:142) ≤ 0 . To see this , z U(cid:142) − z P(cid:142) = (cid:135) U (cid:235) − 1 , where (cid:235) ≡ (cid:54) 1 + (cid:52)(cid:146) / (cid:142)(cid:53) (cid:136) (cid:55) (cid:52) 1 − (cid:136)(cid:53) / (cid:136) . If 0 < (cid:136) < 1 , or 0 < (cid:130) < 12 , then (cid:135) U ≤ 1 , but (cid:235) ≥ 1 . However , (cid:136) → 0 implies that (cid:235) becomes very large , and (cid:136) = 1 implies that (cid:235) = 1 . Moreover , (cid:235) declines monotonically with (cid:136) . Consider (cid:161) log (cid:235) / (cid:161)(cid:136) = − (cid:136) − 2 log (cid:235) (cid:48) + (cid:54)(cid:52) 1 − (cid:136)(cid:53) / (cid:136)(cid:55)(cid:54)(cid:52)(cid:146) / (cid:142)(cid:53) (cid:136) / (cid:235) (cid:48) (cid:55) log (cid:52)(cid:146) / (cid:142)(cid:53) , where (cid:235) (cid:48) ≡ (cid:54) 1 + (cid:52)(cid:146) / (cid:142)(cid:53) (cid:136) (cid:55) . This expression is negative because we study cases in which (cid:146) / (cid:142) < 1 . As a result , there is a threshold (cid:136) ∗ < 1 , or (cid:130) ∗ < 12 , such that (cid:130) > (cid:130) ∗ → z U(cid:142) − z P(cid:142) < 0 , and vice versa . Thus , at (cid:145) = (cid:145) ∗ , increases in (cid:142) induce a switch to the P mode . To check for W U(cid:142) − W P(cid:142) , using the logic of the proof of the previous theorem , we can write W U(cid:142) = N(cid:231) (cid:142) + (cid:52) 1 − (cid:145)(cid:53)(cid:54) 1 − p + (cid:52) 1 − (cid:140)(cid:53)b(cid:53)(cid:52) − p (cid:142) + b (cid:142) (cid:53) + (cid:140)b (cid:142) (cid:52)p + (cid:52) 1 − (cid:140)(cid:53)b(cid:53) + (cid:140) (cid:48) h (cid:142) (cid:55) + (cid:145) (cid:2) (cid:52) 1 − p + (cid:52) 1 − (cid:139)(cid:53)b(cid:53) (cid:0) − p (cid:142) + b (cid:142) + (cid:139)b (cid:142) (cid:52)p + (cid:52) 1 − (cid:139)(cid:53)b(cid:53) + h (cid:142) (cid:55)(cid:49) where for simplicity we suppressed the superscripts U . The expression for W P(cid:142) is the same with (cid:139) = (cid:140) = h (cid:142) = 0 , and the variables are all evaluated at the P mode . Recall that , as noted in the proof of the previous theorem , at (cid:145) = (cid:145) ∗ , p U = p P and (cid:135) U b U = b P . Then , in W U(cid:142) − W P(cid:142) , the difference between (cid:52) 1 − p + (cid:52) 1 − (cid:140)(cid:53)b(cid:53)(cid:52) − p (cid:142) + b (cid:142) (cid:53) + (cid:140)b (cid:142) (cid:52)p − (cid:52) 1 − (cid:140)(cid:53)b(cid:53) and the equivalent term in W P(cid:142) , weighed by (cid:52) 1 − (cid:145)(cid:53) , and the difference between (cid:52) 1 − p + (cid:52) 1 − (cid:139)(cid:53)b(cid:53)(cid:52) − p (cid:142) + b (cid:142) + (cid:139)b (cid:142) (cid:52)p − (cid:52) 1 − (cid:139)(cid:53)b(cid:53) and the equivalent term in W P(cid:142) , weighed by (cid:145) , yields , after some algebra , (cid:54)(cid:52) 1 − (cid:135)(cid:53) + (cid:145)(cid:52) 1 − (cid:145)(cid:53)(cid:52)(cid:139) − (cid:140)(cid:53) 2 b(cid:55)b (cid:142) ≥ 0 . In addition , while h P does not change with (cid:142) , h U increases in (cid:142) . We conclude that at (cid:145) = (cid:145) ∗ , where W U ≥ W P , the sign of W U(cid:142) − W P(cid:142) is ambiguous and can very well be positive . Since (cid:130) > (cid:130) ∗ implies (cid:231) U(cid:142) − (cid:231) P(cid:142) ≤ 0 , it may be that a higher (cid:142) induces ﬁrms to switch to the P mode , while welfare is still higher under the U mode .
