SUMMARY The pluripotent state of embryonic stem cells ( ESCs ) is produced by active transcription of genes that control cell identity and repression of genes encoding lineage - specifying developmental regulators . Here we use ESC cohesin ChIAPET data to identify the local chromosomal structures at both active and repressed genes across the genome . The results produce a map of enhancer - promoter interactions and reveal that super - enhancer driven genes generally occur within chromosome structures that are formed by the looping of two interacting CTCF sites co - occupied by cohesin . These looped structures form insulated neighborhoods whose integrity is important for proper expression of local genes . We also find that repressed genes encoding lineage - specifying developmental regulators occur within insulated neighborhoods . These results provide new © 2014 Elsevier Inc . All rights reserved .

N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t insights into the relationship between transcriptional control of cell identity genes and control of local chromosome structure . INTRODUCTION Embryonic stem cells depend on active transcription of genes that play prominent roles in pluripotency ( ES cell identity genes ) and on repression of genes encoding lineage - specifying developmental regulators ( Ng and Surani , 2011 ; Orkin and Hochedlinger , 2011 ; Young , 2011 ) . The master transcription factors ( TFs ) OCT4 , SOX2 and NANOG ( OSN ) form super - enhancers at most cell identity genes , including those encoding the master TFs themselves ; these super - enhancers contain exceptional levels of transcription apparatus and drive high - level expression of associated genes ( Hnisz et al . , 2013 ; Whyte et al . , 2013 ) . Maintenance of the pluripotent ESC state also requires that genes encoding lineage - specifying developmental regulators remain repressed , as expression of these genes can stimulate differentiation and thus loss of ESC identity . These repressed lineage - specifying genes are occupied by Polycomb group proteins in ESCs ( Boyer et al . , 2006 ; Lee et al . , 2006 ; Margueron and Reinberg , 2011 ; Squazzo et al . , 2006 ) . The ability to express or repress these key genes in a precise and sustainable fashion is thus essential to maintaining ESC identity . Recent pioneering studies of mammalian chromosome structure have suggested that they are organized into a hierarchy of units , which include Topologically Associating Domains ( TADs ) and gene loops ( Figure 1A ) ( Dixon et al . , 2012 ; Filippova et al . , 2014 ; Gibcus and Dekker , 2013 ; Naumova et al . , 2013 ; Nora et al . , 2012 ) . TADs , also known as Topological Domains , are defined by DNA - DNA interaction frequencies , and their boundaries are regions across which relatively few DNA - DNA interactions occur ( Dixon et al . , 2012 ; Nora et al . , 2012 ) . TADs average 0 . 8 Mb , contain approximately 7 protein - coding genes and have boundaries that are shared by the different cell types of an organism ( Dixon et al . , 2012 ; Smallwood and Ren , 2013 ) . The expression of genes within a TAD is somewhat correlated , and thus some TADs tend to have active genes and others tend to have repressed genes ( Cavalli and Misteli , 2013 ; Gibcus and Dekker , 2013 ; Nora et al . , 2012 ) . Gene loops and other structures within TADs are thought to reflect the activities of transcription factors ( TFs ) , cohesin and CTCF ( Baranello et al . , 2014 ; Gorkin et al . , 2014 ; Phillips - Cremins et al . , 2013 ; Seitan et al . , 2013 ; Zuin et al . , 2014 ) . The structures within TADs include cohesin - associated enhancer - promoter loops that are produced when enhancer - bound TFs bind cofactors such as Mediator that , in turn , bind RNA polymerase II at promoter sites ( Lee and Young , 2013 ; Lelli et al . , 2012 ; Roeder , 2005 ; Spitz and Furlong , 2012 ) . The cohesin - loading factor NIPBL binds Mediator and loads cohesin at these enhancer - promoter loops ( Kagey et al . , 2010 ) . Cohesin also becomes associated with CTCF - bound regions of the genome and some of these cohesin - associated CTCF sites facilitate gene activation while others may function as insulators ( Dixon et al . , 2012 ; Parelho et al . , 2008 ; Phillips - Cremins and Corces , 2013 ; Seitan et al . , 2013 ; Wendt et al . , 2008 ) . The chromosome structures anchored by Mediator and cohesin are thought to be mostly cell - type - specific , whereas those anchored by CTCF and cohesin tend to be larger and shared by Dowen et al .

N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t most cell types ( Phillips - Cremins et al . , 2013 ; Seitan et al . , 2013 ) . Despite this picture of cohesin - associated enhancer - promoter loops and cohesin - associated CTCF loops , we do not yet understand the relationship between the transcriptional control of cell identity and the sub - TAD structures of chromosomes that may contribute to this control . Furthermore , there is limited evidence that that the integrity of sub - TAD structures is important for normal expression of genes located in the vicinity of these structures . To gain insights into the cohesin - associated chromosome structures that may contribute to the control of pluripotency in ESCs , we generated a large cohesin ChIA - PET dataset and integrated this with other genome - wide data to identify local structures across the genome . The results show that super - enhancer driven cell identity genes and repressed genes encoding lineage - specifying developmental regulators occur within insulated neighborhoods formed by the looping of two CTCF interaction sites occupied by cohesin . Perturbation of these structures demonstrates that their integrity is important for normal expression of genes located in the vicinity of the neighborhoods . RESULTS Cohesin ChIA - PET in ESCs The organization of mammalian chromosomes involves structural units with various sizes and properties , and cohesin , a Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes ( SMC ) complex , participates in DNA interactions that include enhancer - promoter loops and larger loop structures that occur within Topologically Associating Domains ( TADs ) ( Figure 1A ) . ESC ChIP - seq data indicate that ~ 40 % of cohesin - occupied sites involve active enhancers and promoters , ~ 3 % involve genes with Polycomb modifications , and ~ 50 % involve CTCF sites that are not associated with enhancers , promoters or Polycomb - occupied sites ( Figure 1B , S1A , S1B ) . We employed cohesin ChIA - PET to further investigate the relationship between control of the ESC pluripotency program and control of local chromosome structure . We selected cohesin because it is a relatively well - studied SMC complex that is loaded at enhancer - promoter loops , and can thus identify those interactions , and can also migrate to CTCF sites and thus identify those interactions as well ( Kagey et al . , 2010 ; Parelho et al . , 2008 ; Rubio et al . , 2008 ; Schaaf et al . , 2013 ; Wendt et al . , 2008 ) . The ChIA - PET technique was used because it yields high - resolution ( ~ 4kb ) genome - wide interaction data , which is important because most loops involved in transcriptional regulation are between 1 and 100kb ( Gibcus and Dekker , 2013 ) . We hoped to extend previous findings that mapped interactions among regulatory elements across portions of the ESC genome ( Denholtz et al . , 2013 ; Phillips - Cremins et al . , 2013 ; Seitan et al . , 2013 ) and gain a detailed understanding of the relationship between transcriptional control of ESC identity genes and control of local chromosome structure . To identify interactions between cohesin - occupied sites , we generated biological replicates of SMC1 ChIA - PET datasets in ESCs totaling ~ 400 million reads ( Table S1A ) . The two biological replicates showed a high degree of correlation ( Pearson ' s r > 0 . 91 , Figure S1C , S1D ) , so we pooled the replicate data and processed it using an established protocol ( Li et al . , 2010 ) , with modifications described in Extended Experimental Procedures ( Figure S1 , Table S1A ) . The dataset contained ~ 19 million unique paired - end tags ( PETs ) that were Dowen et al . Page 3 Cell . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2015 October 09 . N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t used to identify PET peaks ( Figure 1C ) . Interactions between PET peaks were identified and filtered for length and significance ( Figure 1C , S1E , S1F , Table S1B , Extended Experimental Procedures ) . The analysis method produced 1 , 234 , 006 cohesin - associated DNA interactions ( Figure1C , Table S1B ) . The vast majority ( 92 % ) of these interacting cohesin - occupied sites occurred at enhancers , promoters and CTCF binding sites , consistent with the known roles of cohesin at these regulatory elements ( Figure 1D ) . Genomic data of any type is noisy , and our confidence in the interpretation of DNA interaction data is improved by identifying PETs that represent independent events in the sample and pass statistical significance tests . For this reason , we generated a high - confidence interaction ( FDR ≤ 0 . 01 ) dataset by requiring that at least three independent PETs support the identified interaction between two PET peaks . The high - confidence dataset consisted of 23 , 835 interactions that were almost entirely intrachromosomal ( 99 % ) , and included 2 , 921 enhancer - promoter interactions , 2 , 700 enhancer - enhancer interactions and 7 , 841 interactions between nonenhancer , non - promoter CTCF sites ( Figure 1C , 1D , S1G , S2 , Table S1B ) . Unless stated otherwise , the high - confidence dataset was used for further quantitative analysis . We used the interaction datasets to create a table of enhancer - promoter assignments for ESCs ( Table S2A - C ) . We found that the interaction data supported 83 % of super - enhancer assignments to the proximal active gene and 87 % of typical enhancer assignments to the proximal active gene ( Table S2B , C ) , with approximately half of the remainder were assigned to the second most proximal gene . The interaction data most frequently assigned super - enhancers and typical enhancers to a single gene , with 76 % of super - enhancers and 84 % of typical enhancers showing evidence of interaction with a single gene . Prior studies have suggested there can be more frequent interactions between enhancers and genes ( Kieffer - Kwon et al . , 2013 ; Sanyal et al . , 2012 ; Shen et al . , 2012 ) ; our high - confidence data is not saturating and does not address the upper limits of these interactions ( Figure S1H , Extended Experimental Procedures ) . The catalogue of enhancer - promoter assignments provided by these interaction data should prove useful for future studies of the roles of ESC enhancers and their associated factors in control of specific target genes . The majority of cohesin ChIA - PET interactions did not cross the boundaries of previously defined TADs ( Dixon et al . , 2012 ; Filippova et al . , 2014 ; Meuleman et al . , 2013 ; Wen et al . , 2009 ) ( Figure 2 , Table S3A ) . Figure 2A shows a representative example of a TAD , where the majority ( 96 % ) of interactions occur within the domain . As expected from previous studies , the TAD boundaries are enriched for cohesin and CTCF and thus cohesin ChIA - PET peaks ( Figure 2B ) . Genome - wide analysis shows that 88 % of all interactions are contained within TADs ( Figure 2C ) and are somewhat enriched near the boundaries of TADs ( Figure 2D ) . The majority of cohesin ChIA - PET interactions did not cross lamin - associated domains ( LADs ) , which are associated with repression at the nuclear periphery , or LOCK domains , which are large regions of chromatin marked with histone H3K9 modifications ( Table S3A ) ( Meuleman et al . , 2013 ; Wen et al . , 2009 ) . These results are consistent with properties previously described for TAD , LAD and LOCK domain structures . Dowen et al . Page 4 Cell . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2015 October 09 . N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t Super - enhancer Domain Structure Super - enhancers drive expression of key cell identity genes and are densely occupied by the transcription apparatus and its cofactors , including cohesin ( Dowen et al . , 2013 ; Hnisz et al . , 2013 ) . Analysis of high - confidence cohesin ChIA - PET interaction data revealed a striking feature common to loci containing super - enhancers and their associated genes ( Figure 3 ) . This feature consisted of a super - enhancer and its associated gene located within a loop connected by two interacting CTCF sites co - occupied by cohesin ( Figure 3A , 3B , Figure S3A - J ) . The vast majority of ESC super - enhancers ( 84 % ) are contained within these structures , which we call Super - enhancer Domains ( SDs ) ( Figure 3B ; Table S4A , B , Extended Experimental Procedures ) . In contrast , only 48 % of typical enhancers were found to occur within comparable loops between two CTCF sites . The 197 SDs average 106 kb and most frequently contain 1 or 2 genes ( Table S4A , C ) . It was evident that there were cohesin - associated interactions between individual enhancer elements ( constituents ) of super - enhancers as well as interactions between super - enhancers and the promoters of their associated genes ( Figure S3A - J ) . Indeed , the results suggest that super - enhancer constituents have cohesin - associated interactions with one another ( 345 interactions ) even more frequently than they do with their associated genes ( 216 interactions ) . The SDs contain high densities of pluripotency transcription factors , Mediator and cohesin , together with histone modifications associated with transcriptionally active enhancers and genes ( Figure 3C ) . It was notable that the majority ( 82 % ) of interactions within SDs do not cross the CTCF sites at SD borders ( Figure 3D ) and that the majority of Mediator , Pol2 and H3K27ac signal associated with super - enhancers and their associated genes occurs inside of the CTCF sites at SD borders ( Figure 3E ) . The cohesin ChIA - PET interaction data and the distribution of the transcription apparatus suggest that the interacting cohesin - occupied CTCF sites tend to restrict the interactions of super - enhancers to those genes within the SD . Super - enhancer Domain Function Because super - enhancers contain an exceptional amount of transcription apparatus and CTCF has been associated with insulator activity ( Essafi et al . , 2011 ; Handoko et al . , 2011 ; Ong and Corces , 2014 ; Phillips and Corces , 2009 ; Phillips - Cremins and Corces , 2013 ) , we postulated that SD structures might be necessary for proper regulation of genes in the vicinity of these structures . To test this model , we investigated the effect of deleting SD boundary CTCF sites on expression of genes inside and immediately outside of SDs ( Figure 4 ) . For this purpose , we studied five SDs whose super - enhancer associated genes play key roles in embryonic stem cell biology ( miR - 290 - 295 , Nanog , Tdgf1 , Pou5f1 ( Oct4 ) , and Prdm14 ) . In all cases , we found that deletion of a CTCF site led to altered expression of nearby genes . In 4 / 5 cases , deletion of a CTCF site led to increased expression of genes immediately outside the SDs and in 3 / 5 cases , deletion of a CTCF site caused changes in expression of genes within the SDs . The miR - 290 - 295 locus , which specifies miRNAs with roles in ESC biology , is located within an SD ( Figure 4A ) . The miR - 290 - 295 SD contains no other annotated gene and the Dowen et al .

N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t closest gene that resides outside this SD is Nlrp12 , located ~ 20kb downstream of miR - 290 - 295 . CRISPR - mediated deletion of a boundary CTCF site ( C1 ) at the miR - 290 - 295 locus caused a ~ 50 % reduction in the miR - 290 - 295 pri - miRNA transcript and an 8 - fold increase in transcript levels for Nlrp12 ( Figure 4A ) . The CTCF deletion had no effect on expression of two genes located further away , AU018091 and Myadm ( Figure 4A ) . These results indicate that normal expression of the miR - 290 - 295 pri - miRNA transcript is dependent on the CTCF boundary site and furthermore , that genes located immediately outside of this SD can be activated when the SD CTCF boundary site is disrupted . The Nanog gene , which encodes a key pluripotency transcription factor , is located within an SD shown in Figure 4B . The Nanog SD contains no other annotated gene and the closest upstream gene that resides outside this SD is Dppa3 , which is located ~ 50kb upstream of Nanog . CRISPR - mediated deletion of the boundary CTCF site C1 of the Nanog SD led to a ~ 40 % drop in Nanog transcript levels ( Figure 4B ) . In this case , there was no significant change in the level of the Dppa3 transcript ( Figure 4B ) . These results indicate that normal expression of the Nanog transcript is dependent on the C1 CTCF site . The Tdgf1 gene , which encodes an epidermal growth factor essential for embryonic development , is located within an SD ( Figure 4C ) . In this SD , it is possible that the super - enhancer regulates both the Tdgf1 and Lrrc2 genes and this Tdgf1 / Lrrc2 SD also contains the Rtp3 gene . The closest gene that resides outside this SD is Gm590 , which is located ~ 30kb downstream of Tdgf1 . CRISPR - mediated deletion of a boundary CTCF site ( C1 ) of the Tdgf1 / Lrrc2 SD had little effect on Tdgf1 and Rtp3 transcript levels , but had a modest effect on Lrrc2 transcript levels and caused a nearly 10 - fold increase in the levels of Gm590 transcripts ( Figure 4C ) . The Pou5f1 gene , which encodes pluripotency transcription factor OCT4 , is located within an SD ( Figure 4D ) . The Pou5f1 SD contains no other annotated gene . We were not able to obtain a bi - allelic CRISPR - mediated deletion of a boundary CTCF site , despite multiple attempts , but did obtain a mono - allelic deletion of the boundary CTCF site C1 ( Figure 4D ) . This mono - allelic deletion had little effect on the levels of Pou5f1 transcripts , but increased the levels of transcripts for H2 - Q10 , the gene closest to the deleted boundary , by ~ 2 . 5 - fold ( Figure 4D ) . Transcription of the gene closest to the uninterrupted boundary of the Pou5f1 SD , Tcf19 , was unaffected by the C1 deletion . The Prdm14 gene , which encodes a pluripotency transcription factor , is located within an SD ( Figure 4E ) . The Prdm14 SD contains no other annotated gene and the closest downstream gene that resides outside this SD is Slco5a1 , which is located ~ 100kb downstream of Prdm14 . The Prdm14 SD has two neighboring cohesin - associated CTCF sites at one boundary ; CRISPR - mediated deletion of a single boundary CTCF site ( C1 ) had no effect on expression of Prdm14 or Slco5a1 , but deletion of both CTCF sites ( C1 and C2 ) at that boundary caused a 3 . 5 - fold increase in expression of Slco5a1 ( Figure 4E ) . We tested whether the super - enhancers from disrupted SD structures show increased interaction frequencies with the newly activated genes outside the SD by using 3C . At two loci where loss of an SD boundary CTCF site led to significant activation of the gene Dowen et al . Page 6 Cell . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2015 October 09 . N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t outside the SD ( miR - 290 - 295 and Pou5f1 ) we performed quantitative 3C experiments to measure the contact frequency between the super - enhancers and the genes immediately outside of SDs in wild type cells and in cells where the SD boundary CTCF site was deleted . In both cases , loss of the CTCF site led to an increase in the contact frequency between the super - enhancers and the genes immediately outside of SDs that were newly activated ( Figure S4A , S4B ) . We investigated whether altered SD boundaries that affect cell identity genes cause ESCs to express markers consistent with an altered cell state . Indeed , we found that ESCs lacking the miR - 290 - 295 boundary CTCF site C1 exhibit increased expression of the ectodermal marker Pax6 and decreased expression of the endodermal lineage markers Gata6 and Sox17 , suggesting that loss of the SD structure is sufficient to affect cell identity ( Figure S4C ) . Previous studies have shown that miR - 290 - 295 null ESCs show an increased propensity to differentiate into ectodermal lineages at the expense of endoderm ( Kaspi et al . , 2013 ) . In summary , the loss of CTCF sites at the boundaries of SDs can cause a change in the level of transcripts for super - enhancer associated genes within the SD and frequently leads to activation of genes near these CTCF sites . These results indicate that the integrity of SDs is important for normal expression of genes located in the vicinity of the SD , which can include genes that are key to control of cell identity . Polycomb Domains Maintenance of the pluripotent ESC state requires that genes encoding lineage - specifying developmental regulators are repressed , and these repressed lineage - specifying genes are occupied by nucleosomal histones that carry the Polycomb - associated mark H3K27me3 ( Margueron and Reinberg , 2011 ; Young , 2011 ) . The mechanisms responsible for maintaining the H3K27me3 mark across short spans of regulatory regions and promoters of repressed genes are not well understood , although CTCF sites have been implicated ( Cuddapah et al . , 2009 ; Schwartz et al . , 2012 ; Van Bortle et al . , 2012 ) . Analysis of the H3K27me3 - marked genes revealed that they , like the super - enhancer - associated genes , are typically located within a loop between two interacting CTCF sites co - occupied by cohesin ( Figure 5A , 5B , Figure S5A - J , Table S5A ) . These Polycomb Domain ( PD ) structures share many features with the Super - enhancer Domains . The majority ( 70 % ) ( 380 / 546 ) of Polycomb - associated genes occur in PD structures . PDs average 112 kb and generally contain 1 or 2 genes ( Table S5B ) . The PDs contain exceptionally high densities of the Polycomb proteins EZH2 , SUZ12 and the associated histone modification H3K27me3 ( Figure 5C ) . The majority ( 78 % ) of cohesin ChIA - PET interactions originating in PDs occur within the PD boundaries ( Figure 5D ) . Furthermore , the Polycomb mark H3K27me3 tends to be retained within the PD ( Figure 5E ) . We postulated that the CTCF boundaries that form PD structures might be important for repression of the Polycomb - marked genes within the PD , and investigated the effect of deleting boundary CTCF sites on a PD containing Tcfap2e to test this idea ( Figure 5F ) . CRISPR - mediated deletion of one of the boundary CTCF sites ( C1 ) of the Tcfap2e PD caused a 1 . 7 fold increase in transcript levels for Tcfap2e ( P - value < 0 . 05 ) and no significant change in transcript levels for nearby genes within or outside of the PD . CRISPR - mediated Dowen et al . Page 7 Cell . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2015 October 09 . N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t deletion of the other boundary CTCF site ( C2 ) caused a 4 - fold increase in the expression of Tcfap2e ( P - value < 0 . 001 ) and little effect on adjacent genes . These results suggest that the integrity of the CTCF boundaries of PDs is important for full repression of H3K27me3 - occupied genes . Insulated Neighborhoods in Multiple Cell Types A previous study suggested that DNA loops mediated by cohesin and CTCF tend to be larger and more shared among multiple cell types than DNA loops associated with cohesin and Mediator , which represent enhancer - promoter interactions that may be cell - type specific ( Phillips - Cremins et al . , 2013 ) . This led us to postulate that 1 ) the interacting CTCF structures of SDs and PDs may be common to multiple cell types , and 2 ) the acquisition of super - enhancers and Polycomb binding within these common domain structures will vary based on the gene expression program of the cell type ( Figure 6A ) . To test this model , we compared the SDs identified in ESCs to comparable regions in neural precursor cells ( NPCs ) where 5C interaction data was available for specific loci ( Phillips - Cremins et al . , 2013 ) . We found , for example , that the Nanog locus SD observed in ESCs with ChIA - PET data was also detected by 5C data in NPCs ( Figure 6B ) . In NPCs , the Nanog gene is not expressed and no super - enhancers are formed at this locus ( Figure 6B ) . Similarly , there is evidence for a common structure involving CTCF sites bounding the Olig1 / Olig2 locus in both ESCs and NPCs ( Figure 6B ) . In this domain , the Olig1 / Olig2 genes are not active and no super - enhancers are formed in ESCs , whereas there are three super - enhancers in NPCs , where these genes are highly expressed ( Figure 6B , S6A ) . For regions where 5C interaction data in NPCs and ChIA - PET interaction data in ESCs could be compared , a total of 11 out of 32 interactions between CTCF sites identified in NPCs were supported by interaction data in ESCs ( Table S3B ) , which is impressive given the sparsity of interaction data . This supports the view that the interacting CTCF structures of ESC SDs may be common to multiple cell types . If the CTCF boundaries of ESC SDs and PDs are common to many cell types , we would expect that the binding of CTCF to the SD and PD boundary sites observed in ESCs will be conserved across multiple cell types . To test this notion , we examined CTCF ChIP - seq peaks from 18 mouse cell types and determined how frequently CTCF binding occurred across these cell types ( Figure 6C ) . When all ESC CTCF ChIP - seq peaks were included in the analysis , we found that there was fairly even distribution of the data into bins representing one or more cell types ( Figure 6C ) . In contrast , CTCF peaks co - bound by cohesin , which included those at SD and PD borders were observed more frequently in bins representing a larger fraction of the cell types ( Figure 6C ; Figure S6B ) . These results indicate that the CTCF boundary sites of ESC SDs and PDs are frequently occupied by CTCF in multiple cell types , and together with the analysis of interaction data for NPCs described above , support the idea that CTCF - CTCF interaction structures may often be shared by ESCs and more differentiated cell types .

There is much evidence that cohesin and CTCF have roles in connecting gene regulation and chromosome structure in ESCs ( Cavalli and Misteli , 2013 ; Dixon et al . , 2012 ; Gibcus and Dekker , 2013 ; Gorkin et al . , 2014 ; Merkenschlager and Odom , 2013 ; Phillips - Cremins and Corces , 2013 ; Phillips - Cremins et al . , 2013 ; Sanyal et al . , 2012 ; Sofueva et al . , 2013 ) but limited knowledge of the these structures across the genome and scant functional evidence that specific structures actually contribute to the control of important ESC genes . We describe here organizing principles that explain how a key set of cohesin - associated chromosome structures contribute to the ESC gene expression program . To gain insights into the relationship between transcriptional control of cell identity and control of chromosome structure , we carried out cohesin ChIA - PET and focused the analysis on loci containing super - enhancers , which drive expression of key cell identity genes . We found that the majority of super - enhancers and their associated genes occur within large loops that are connected through interacting CTCF sites co - occupied by cohesin . These super - enhancer domains , or SDs , typically contain one super - enhancer that loops to one gene within the SD . The SDs appear to restrict super - enhancer activity to genes within the SD , because the cohesin ChIA - PET interactions occur primarily within the SD and loss of a CTCF boundary tends to cause inappropriate activation of nearby genes located outside that boundary . The proper association of super - enhancers and their target genes in such “insulated neighborhoods” is of considerable importance since the mis - targeting of a single super - enhancer is sufficient to cause leukemia ( Groschel et al . , 2014 ) . The cohesin ChIA - PET data and perturbation of CTCF sites suggest that genes that encode repressed , lineage - specifying , developmental regulators also occur within insulated neighborhoods in ESCs . Maintenance of the pluripotent ESC state requires that genes encoding lineage - specifying developmental regulators are repressed , and these repressed lineage - specifying genes are occupied by nucleosomal histones that carry the Polycomb mark H3K27me3 ( Boyer et al . , 2006 ; Bracken et al . , 2006 ; Lee et al . , 2006 ; Negre et al . , 2006 ; Schwartz et al . , 2006 ; Squazzo et al . , 2006 ; Tolhuis et al . , 2006 ) . The majority of these genes were found to be located within a cohesion - associated CTCF - CTCF loop , which we call a Polycomb Domain , or PD . The perturbation of CTCF PD boundary sites caused de - repression of the Polycomb - bound gene within the PD , suggesting that these boundaries are important for maintenance of gene repression within the PD . CTCF has previously been shown to be associated with boundary formation , insulator activity and transcriptional regulation ( Bell et al . , 1999 ; Denholtz et al . , 2013 ; Felsenfeld et al . , 2004 ; Handoko et al . , 2011 ; Kim et al . , 2007 ; Phillips and Corces , 2009 ; Schwartz et al . , 2012 ; Sexton et al . , 2012 ; Soshnikova et al . , 2010 ; Valenzuela and Kamakaka , 2006 ) . Previous reports have also demonstrated that cohesin and CTCF are associated with large loop substructures within TADs , whereas cohesin and Mediator are associated with smaller loop structures that sometimes form within the CTCF - bounded loops ( de Wit et al . , 2013 ; Phillips - Cremins et al . , 2013 ; Sofueva et al . , 2013 ) . CTCF - bound domains have been Dowen et al . Page 9 Cell . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2015 October 09 . N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t proposed to confine the activity of enhancers to specific target genes , thus yielding proper tissue - specific expression of genes ( DeMare et al . , 2013 ; Handoko et al . , 2011 ; Hawkins et al . , 2011 ) . Our genome - wide study extends these observations by connecting such structures with the transcriptional control of specific super - enhancer - driven and Polycomb - repressed cell identity genes , and by showing that these structures can contribute to the control of genes inside and outside of the insulated neighborhoods that contain key pluripotency genes . The organization of key cell identity genes into insulated neighborhoods may be a property common to all mammalian cell types . Indeed , several recent studies have identified CTCF bounded regions whose function is consistent with ESC SDs ( Guo et al . , 2011 ; Wang et al . , 2014 ) . For example , in T cell acute lymphocytic leukemia , Notch1 activation leads to increased expression of a super - enhancer - - driven gene found between two CTCF sites that are structurally connected , but does not affect genes located outside of the two CTCF sites ( Wang et al . , 2014 ) . Future studies addressing the mechanisms that regulate loop formation should provide additional insights into the relationships between transcriptional control of cell identity genes and control of local chromosome structure . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Cell Culture V6 . 5 murine ESCs were grown on irradiated murine embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) under standard ESC conditions as described previously ( Whyte et al . , 2012 ) . Genome Editing The CRISPR / Cas9 system was used to create ESC lines with CTCF site deletions . Target - specific oligonucleotides were cloned into a plasmid carrying a codon - optimized version of Cas9 ( pX330 , Addgene : 42230 ) . The genomic sequences complementary to guide RNAs in the genome editing experiments are listed in the Extended Experimental Procedures . Cells were transfected with two plasmids expressing Cas9 and sgRNA targeting regions around 200 basepairs up - and down - stream of the CTCF binding site , respectively . A plasmid expressing PGK - puroR was also co - transfected , using X - fect reagent ( Clontech ) according to the manufacturer ' s instructions . One day after transfection , cells were re - plated on DR4 MEF feeder layers . One day after re - plating , puromycin ( 2ug / ml ) was added for three days . Subsequently , puromycin was withdrawn for three to four days . Individual colonies were picked and genotyped by PCR . ChIA - PET SMC1 ChIA - PET was performed as previously described ( Chepelev et al . , 2012 ; Fullwood et al . , 2009 ; Goh et al . , 2012 ; Li et al . , 2012 ) . Briefly , murine ESCs ( up to 1×10 8 cells ) were treated with 1 % formaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min and then neutralized using 0 . 2M glycine . The crosslinked chromatin was fragmented by sonication to size lengths of 300 - 700 bp . The anti - SMC1 antibody ( Bethyl , A300 - 055A ) was used to enrich SMC1 - bound chromatin fragments . A portion of ChIP DNA was eluted from antibody - coated beads for concentration quantification and for enrichment analysis using quantitative PCR . For ChIA - PET library construction ChIP DNA fragments were end - repaired using T4 DNA Dowen et al . Page 10 Cell . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2015 October 09 .

After linker ligation , the two samples were combined for proximity ligation in diluted conditions . Following proximity ligation , the Paired - End Tag ( PET ) constructs were extracted from the ligation products and the PET templates were subjected to 50x50 paired - end sequencing using Illumina HiSeq 2000 . Data analysis ChIA - PET data analysis was performed as previously described ( Li et al . , 2010 ) , with modifications described in the Extended Experimental Procedures . The high confidence interactions for the two biological replicate SMC1 ChIA - PET experiments and for the merged dataset are listed in Tables S1C , S1D and S1E , respectively .
