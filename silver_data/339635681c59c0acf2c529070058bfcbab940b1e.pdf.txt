Lander 1 , 3 * & Bradley E . Bernstein 1 , 4 , 6 * We report the application of single - molecule - based sequencing technology for high - throughput profiling of histone modifications in mammalian cells . By obtaining over four billion bases of sequence from chromatin immunoprecipitated DNA , we generated genome - wide chromatin - state maps of mouse embryonic stem cells , neural progenitor cells and embryonic fibroblasts . We find that lysine 4 and lysine 27 trimethylation effectively discriminates genes that are expressed , poised for expression , or stably repressed , and therefore reflect cell state and lineage potential . Lysine 36 trimethylation marks primary coding and non - coding transcripts , facilitating gene annotation . Trimethylation of lysine 9 and lysine 20 is detected at satellite , telomeric and active long - terminal repeats , and can spread into proximal unique sequences . Lysine 4 and lysine 9 trimethylation marks imprinting control regions . Finally , we show that chromatin state can be read in an allele - specific manner by using single nucleotide polymorphisms . This study provides a framework for the application of comprehensive chromatin profiling towards characterization of diverse mammalian cell populations . One of the fundamental mysteries of biology is the basis of cellular state . Although they have essentially identical genomes , the different cell types in a multicellular organism maintain markedly different behaviours that persist over extended periods . The most extreme case is lineage commitment during development , where cells progress from totipotency to pluripotency to terminal differentiation ; each step involves establishment of a stable state encoding specific developmental commitments that can be faithfully transmitted to daughter cells . Considerable evidence suggests that cellular state may be closely related to ‘chromatin state’—that is , modifications to histones and other proteins that package the genome 1 – 3 . Accordingly , it would be desirable to construct ‘chromatin - state maps’ for a wide variety of cell types , showing the genome - wide distribution of important chromatin modifications . Chromatin state can be studied by chromatin immunoprecipita - tion ( ChIP ) , in which an antibody is used to enrich DNA from genomic regions carrying a specific epitope . The major challenge to generating genome - wide chromatin - state maps lies in characterizing these enriched regions in a scalable manner . Enrichment at indi - vidual loci is commonly assayed by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) , but this method does not scale efficiently . A more recent approach has been ChIP - chip , in which enriched DNA is hybridized to a microarray 4 , 5 . This technique has been successfully used to study large genomic regions . However , ChIP - chip suffers from inherent technical limitations : ( 1 ) it requires large amounts ( several micro - grams ) of DNA and thus involves extensive amplification , which introduces bias ; ( 2 ) it is subject to cross - hybridization , which hinders the study of repeated sequences and allelic variants ; and ( 3 ) it is currently expensive to study entire mammalian genomes . Given these issues , only a handful of whole - genome ChIP - chip studies in mam - mals have been reported . In principle , chromatin could be readily mapped across the genome by sequencing ChIP DNA and identifying regions that are over - represented among these sequences . Notably , sequence - based mapping could require relatively small quantities of DNA and pro - vide nucleotide - level discrimination of similar sequences , thereby maximizing genome coverage . The major limitation has been that high - resolution mapping requires millions of sequences ( Supple - mentary Note 1 ) . This is cost - prohibitive with traditional techno - logy , even with concatenation of multiple sequence tags 6 . However , recent advances in single - molecule - based sequencing ( SMS ) techno - logy promise to increase throughput and decrease costs markedly 7 . In the approach developed by Illumina / Solexa , DNA molecules are arrayed across a surface , locally amplified , subjected to successive cycles of primer - mediated single - base extension ( using fluorescently labelled reversible terminators ) and imaged after each cycle to deter - mine the inserted base . The ‘read length’ is short ( 25 – 50 bases ) , but tens of millions of DNA fragments may be read simultaneously . Here , we report the development of a method for mapping ChIP enrichment by sequencing ( ChIP - Seq ) and describe its application to create chromatin - state maps for pluripotent and lineage - committed mouse cells . The resulting data define three broad categories of pro - moters based on their chromatin state in embryonic stem ( ES ) cells , including a larger than anticipated set of ‘bivalent’ promoters ; reveal that lineage commitment is accompanied by characteristic chromatin changes at bivalent promoters that parallel changes in gene expression and transcriptional competence ; and demonstrate the potential for using ChIP for genome - wide annotation of novel promoters and primary transcripts , active transposable elements , imprinting control regions and allele - specific transcription . This study provides a tech - nological framework for comprehensive characterization of chro - matin state across diverse mammalian cell populations . * These authors contributed equally to this work . 1 Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT , 2 Division of Health Sciences and Technology , MIT , and 3 Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research , Cambridge , Massachusetts 02142 , USA . 4 Molecular Pathology Unit and Center for Cancer Research , Massachusetts General Hospital , Charlestown , Massachusetts 02129 , USA . 5 Department of Neurology , Children’s Hospital , and 6 Department of Pathology , Harvard Medical School , Boston , Massachusetts 02115 , USA . Vol 448 | 2 August 2007 | doi : 10 . 1038 / nature06008 553 Nature ©2007 PublishingGroup Genome - wide chromatin - state maps We created genome - wide chromatin - state maps for three mouse cell types : ES cells , neural progenitor cells ( NPCs ) 8 and embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) . For each cell type , we prepared and sequenced ChIP DNA samples for some or all of the following features : pan - H3 , trimethylated histone H3 lysine 4 ( H3K4me3 ) , H3K9me3 , H3K27me3 , H3K36me3 , H4K20me3 and RNA polymerase II ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . In each case , we sequenced nanogram quantities of DNA frag - ments ( , 300 base pairs ( bp ) ) on an Illumina / Solexa sequencer . We obtained an average of 10 million successful reads , consisting of the terminal 27 – 36 bases of each fragment . The reads were mapped to the genome and used to determine the number of ChIP fragments overlapping any given position ( Fig . 1 ) . Enriched intervals were defined as regions where this number exceeded a threshold defined by randomization ( see Methods ) . The full data set consists of 18 chromatin - state maps , containing , 140 million uniquely aligned reads , representing over 4 billion bases of sequence . We validated the chromatin - state maps by computational analysis and by comparison to previous methods . ChIP - Seq maps of specific histone modifications show marked enrichment at specific locations in the genome , whereas the pan - H3 and unenriched samples show relatively uniform distributions ( Supplementary Figs 1 and 2 ) . The maps show close agreement with our previously reported ChIP - chip data from , 2 . 5 % of the mouse genome 9 ( Fig . 1 ) .

ARTICLES NATURE | Vol 448 | 2 August 2007 554 Nature ©2007 PublishingGroup counts showed 98 % concordance and a strong , quantitative correla - tion ( Supplementary Fig . 3 and Supplementary Table 2 ) . Promoter state in ES and lineage - committed cells We began our analysis by studying H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 patterns at known promoters . H3K4me3 is catalysed by trithorax - group ( trxG ) proteinsandassociatedwithactivation , whereasH3K27me3iscatalysed by polycomb - group ( PcG ) proteins and associated with silencing 10 , 11 . Recently , we and others observed that some promoters in ES cells carry both H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 9 , 12 . We termed this novel combination a ‘bivalent’ chromatin mark and proposed that it serves to poise key developmental genes for lineage - specific activation or repression . We studied 17 , 762 promoters inferred from full - length transcripts ( Supplementary Table 3 ) . Mammalian RNA polymerase II pro - moters are known to occur in at least two major forms 13 , 14 ( Sup - plementary Fig . 4 ) . CpG - rich promoters are associated with both ubiquitously expressed ‘housekeeping’ genes , and genes with more complex expression patterns , particularly those expressed during embryonic development . CpG - poor promoters are generally assoc - iated with highly tissue - specific genes . Accordingly , we divided our analysis to focus on ‘high’ CpG promoters ( HCP ; n 5 11 , 410 ) and ‘low’ CpG promoters ( LCP ; n 5 3 , 014 ) separately . To ensure a clean separation , we defined a set of intermediate CpG content promoters ( ICP ; n 5 3 , 338 ) ; this class shows properties consistent with being a mixture of the two major classes . High CpG promoters in ES cells . Virtually all HCPs ( 99 % ) are associated with intervals of significant H3K4me3 enrichment in ES cells ( Fig . 2a ) . The modified histones are typically confined to a punctate interval of 1 – 2 kilobases ( kb ) ( Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . As observed previously 15 , 16 , there is a strong correlation between the intensity of H3K4me3 and the expression level of the associated genes ( Spearman’s r 5 0 . 67 ) . However , not all promoters associated with H3K4me3 are active . The chromatin - state maps reveal that , 22 % of HCPs ( n 5 2 , 525 ) are actually bivalent , exhibiting both H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 ( Fig . 2a ) . A minority of these ( n 5 564 ) are ‘wide’ bivalent sites in which H3K27me3 extends over a region of at least 5 kb and resemble those described previously 9 . The majority ( n 5 1 , 961 ) are ‘narrow’ bivalent sites , with more punctate H3K27me3 , that correspond to many additional PcG target promoters 17 – 19 . Bivalent promoters show low activity despite the presence of H3K4me3 , suggesting that the repressive effect of PcG activity is generally dominant over the ubi - quitous trxG activity ( Supplementary Fig . 6 and Supplementary Table 4 ) . The different types of chromatin marks at HCPs are closely related to the nature of the associated genes ( Supplementary Table 5 ) . Monovalent promoters ( H3K4me3 ) generally regulate genes with ‘housekeeping’ functions including replication and basic metabol - ism . By contrast , bivalent promoters are associated with genes with more complex expression patterns , including key developmental transcription factors , morphogens and cell surface molecules . In addition , several bivalent promoters appear to regulate transcripts for lineage - specific microRNAs . High CpG promoters in NPCs and MEFs . Most HCPs marked with H3K4me3 alone in ES cells retain this mark both in NPCs and MEFs ( 92 % in each ; Figs 2b , c and 3a ) . This is consistent with the tendency for this sub - class of promoters to regulate ubiquitous house - keeping genes . A small proportion ( , 4 % ) of these promoters have H3K27me3 in MEFs , and are thus bivalent or marked by H3K27me3 alone . This correlates with lower expression levels and may reflect active recruitment of PcG proteins to new genes during differenti - ation 20 . An example is the transcription factor gene Sox2 , where the promoter is marked by H3K4me3 alone in ES cells and NPCs , but H3K27me3 alone in MEFs . Notably , this locus is flanked by CpG islands with bivalent markings in ES cells ( see below ) , suggesting that the locus may be poised for repression upon differentiation .

NATURE | Vol 448 | 2 August 2007 ARTICLES 555 Nature ©2007 PublishingGroup The majority of HCPs with bivalent marks in ES cells resolve to a monovalent status in the committed cells . In NPCs , 46 % resolve to H3K4me3 only and these genes show increased expression ( Figs 2b , d and 3b ) . Of the remaining promoters , 14 % resolve to H3K27me3 alone and 32 % lose both marks , with both outcomes being associated with low levels of expression . Notably , 8 % remain bivalent and these genes also continue to be repressed ( Figs 2b , d and 3c ) . A less resolved pattern is seen in MEFs , with 32 % marked by H3K4me3 alone , 22 % marked by H3K27me3 alone , 3 % without both marks , and the remaining ( 43 % ) still bivalent ( Fig . 2c ) . The relatively high number of bivalent promoters in MEFs may reflect a less differentiated state and / or heterogeneity in the population . Distinct regulation of low CpG promoters . The LCPs show a very different pattern than the HCPs . Only a small minority ( 6 . 5 % , n 5 207 ) of LCPs have significant H3K4me3 in ES cells and virtually none have H3K27me3 ( Fig . 2a ) . Most of these promoters have lost H3K4me3 in NPCs and MEFs , whereas a small number of other LCPs ( 1 . 5 % and 2 . 6 % , respectively ) have gained the mark ( Figs 2b , c and 3e ) . In all three cell types , the expression levels of the associated genes strongly correlate with the presence or absence of H3K4me3 ( Fig . 2e and Supplementary Fig . 6 ) . The genes with LCPs marked by H3K4me3 are closely related to tissue - specific functions . In NPCs , they include genes encoding sev - eral known markers of neural progenitors in vivo ( such as Fabp7 , Cp , Gpr56 ) . In MEFs , they include genes encoding extracellular matrix components and growth factors ( such as Col3a1 , Col6a1 , Postn , Aspn , Hgf , Figf ) , consistent with the mesenchymal origin of these cells ( see below ) . We conclude that HCPs and LCPs are subject to distinct modes of regulation . In ES cells , all HCPs seem to be targets of trxG activity , and may therefore drive transcription unless actively repressed by PcG proteins . In committed cell types , a subset of HCPs appears to lose the capacity to recruit trxG activity ( possibly due to other epi - genetic modifications , such as DNA methylation 21 ) . In contrast , CpG - poor promoters seem to be inactive by default , independent of repression by PcG proteins , and may instead be selectively acti - vated by cell - type - or tissue - specific factors . Alternative promoter use . We note that genes with alternative pro - moters may have multiple , distinct chromatin states . An ‘active’ state at any one of these promoters may be sufficient to drive expression . A common situation involves genes with one major HCP and one or more alternative LCPs . An example is the transcription factor Foxp2 , which isexpressed atmoderate levels inbothNPCsandMEFs ( Fig . 3f , g ) . The Foxp2 HCP ismarked by H3K4me3 in NPCs , but isbivalent in MEFs . However , an alternative LCP is marked by H3K4me3 exclu - sively in MEFs . The protocadherin - c ( Pcdhg ) locus is a more extreme case : the amino - terminal variable regions of this gene are transcribed from at least 20 different HCPs in neurons 22 , all of which carry biva - lent chromatin marks in ES cells . Pcdhg expression is nevertheless detected by microarrays , possibly owing to a single promoter in front of the carboxy - terminal constant region marked by H3K4me3 alone ( Fig . 3h ) . Although only , 10 % of the genes analysed here have more than one known promoter , recent ‘cap - trapping’ studies suggest that alternative promoter use may be substantially more common 23 . The ability of ChIP - Seq to assess chromatin state at known promo - ters , as well as to identify novel promoters ( see below ) , should prove valuable in analysis of transcriptional networks . Promoter state reflects lineage commitment and potential Given their association with epigenetic memory , we next examined whether the patterns of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 can reflect developmental potential . Both of the committed cell types studied here have been shown to be multipotent ex vivo . NPCs can be differ - entiated to glial and neuronal lineages 8 , whereas primary MEFs have been differentiated into adipocytes 24 , chondrocytes 25 and osteoblast - like cells 26 . Lineage - specific resolution and retention of bivalent marks . We first examined a set of genes involved in in vivo differentiation path - ways known to be , at least partially , recapitulated by MEFs , NPCs , or neither . These genes all have bivalent promoters in ES cells . We found that their resolution in lineage - committed cells is closely related to their demonstrated developmental potential ( Supplementary Table 6 ) : ( 1 ) genes restricted to regulation or specialized functions in unrelated lineages , such as haematopoietic ( Cdx4 , PU . 1 ( also called Sfpi1 ) ) , epithelial ( Cnfn , Krt2 - 4 ) , endoderm ( Gata6 , Pdx1 ) or germ line ( Tenr ( Adad1 ) , Ctcfl ) , generally resolved to monovalent H3K27me3 or carry neither mark in both NPCs and MEFs . ( 2 ) Genes related to adipogenesis and chondro / osteogenesis often remain bivalent in MEFs , but not in NPCs . Examples include Pparg , which is a key regulator of adipogenesis , and Sp7 , which pro - motes chondro / osteogenic pathways . Early mesenchymal markers , such as Runx1 and Sox9 , resolved to H3K4me3 alone in MEFs . ( 3 ) Genes related to gliogenesis and neurogenesis often resolved to H3K4me3 alone or remain bivalent in NPCs , whereas they resolved to H3K27me3 alone in the MEFs . Gliogenesis and neurogenesis are thought to be mutually opposing pathways 27 , and we find that genes promoting gliogenesis are more likely to resolve to H3K4me3 in NPCs . Examples include Bmp2 and the microRNA mir - 9 - 3 , which promotes glial but inhibits neuronal differentiation 28 . Several genes known to promote neuronal differentiation , such as Neurog1 and Neurog2 , remain bivalent whereas others , such as Bmp6 , appear to resolve to H3K27me3 alone . In our hands , the NPCs differentiate to astrocytes with significantly higher efficiency than to neurons ( M . W . , unpublished data ) . The observed chromatin patterns may reflect this gliogenic bias . Correlation with expression in adult tissues . We next analysed gene expression in adult tissues with major contributions from neuroec - todermal or mesenchymal lineages . We reasoned that if H3K4me3 is generally not restored once lost , then differential loss of H3K4me3 at promoters early in these lineages ( as represented by NPCs and MEFs , respectively ) might be reflected in differential gene expression pat - terns in related adult tissues . Notably , we observed a clear bias in relative expression levels between relevant adult tissues for genes that retain H3K4me3 in NPCs only versus genes that retain H3K4me3 in MEFs only . The former are strongly biased towards higher expression in various brain sections , whereas the latter are biased towards higher expression in bone , adipose and other mesenchyme - rich tissues ( Fig . 4 ) . These analyses are limited by alternative promoter usage , the cell models used , and the heterogeneity of the adult tissues . Nonetheless , the data show clear trends that support an important role for reten - tion and resolution of bivalent chromatin in the regulation of hier - archical lineage commitment . Genome - wide annotation of promoters and primary transcripts We next considered genome - wide maps of H3K36me3 . This mark has been linked to transcriptional elongation and may serve to pre - vent aberrant initiation within gene bodies 29 – 33 . Our chromatin maps reveal a global pattern of H3K36me3 in mammals similar to that previously observed in yeast 29 . In all three cell types , H3K36me3 is strongly enriched across the transcribed regions of active genes ( Fig . 5a ) , beginning immediately after the promoter H3K4me3 signal . The level of H3K36me3 is strongly correlated with the level of gene expression ( Spearman’s r 5 0 . 77 ) , although the dynamic range is compressed ( 1 – 2 orders of magnitude for H3K36me3 versus 3 – 4 for expression levels ; Supplementary Fig . 7 ) . Genes with bivalent promoters rarely show H3K36me3 , consistent with their low expression . Notably , there is essentially no overlap between intervals significantly enriched for H3K36me3 and for H3K27me3 , consistent with a role for PcG com - plexes in the exclusion of polymerases 11 . The vast majority of intervals significantly enriched for H3K36me3 is associated with known genes ( , 92 % in ES cells ) , but there are ARTICLES NATURE | Vol 448 | 2 August 2007 556 Nature ©2007 PublishingGroup at least , 500 additional regions across the genome ( median size , 2 kb ) , with most being adjacent to sites of H3K4me3 . Inspection revealed a number of interesting cases , falling into three categories . The first category corresponds to H3K36me3 that extends signifi - cantly upstream from the annotated start of a known gene , often until an H3K4me3 site . These seem to reflect the presence of unannotated alternative promoters . A notable example is the Foxp1 locus . In ES cells , one annotated Foxp1 promoter is marked by H3K4me3 and another CpG - rich region located , 500 kb upstream carries a bivalent mark . In MEFs , this CpG island is marked by H3K4me3 only , and H3K36me3 extends from this site to the 3 9 end of Foxp1 ( Fig . 5a ) . Although no transcript extending across this entire region has been reported in mouse , the orthologous position in human has been shown to act as a promoter for the orthologous gene . The ChIP - Seq data contain many other examples where the combination of H3K36me3 and H3K4me3 seems to reveal novel promoters . The second category corresponds to H3K36me3 that extends sig - nificantly downstream of a known gene . An example is the Sox2 locus , which encodes a pluripotency - associated transcription factor that also functions during neural development . In ES cells , Sox2 has an unusually large region of H3K4me3 ( . 20 kb ) accompanied by H3K36me3 extending far beyond the annotated 3 9 end ( . 15 kb ) ; non - coding transcription throughout the locus has been noted prev - iously 34 and may serve a regulatory role ( Fig . 5b ) . The third category seems to reflect transcription of non - coding RNA genes . For example , two regions with H3K36me3 and adjacent H3K4me3 correspond to recently discovered nuclear transcripts with possible functions in messenger RNA processing 35 ( Fig . 5c ) . In addi - tion , a number of these presumptive transcriptional units overlap microRNAs ( Fig . 5d ) . A striking example is a . 200 - kb interval within the Dlk1 – Dio3 imprinted locus ( Fig . 6a ) . This region harbours over 40 non - coding RNAs , including clusters of microRNAs and small nucleolar RNAs 36 . The ChIP - Seq data suggest that the entire region is transcribed as a single unit that initiates at a H3K4me3 - marked HCP . These findings suggest that genome - wide maps of H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 may provide a general tool for defining novel transcrip - tion units . The capacity to define the origins and extents of primary transcripts will be of particular value for characterizing the regulation of microRNAs and other non - coding RNAs that are rapidly processed fromlongprecursors 37 . Finally , therelativelynarrowdynamicrangeof H3K36me3 may offer advantages over RNA - based approaches in assessing gene expression and defining cellular states . H3K9 and H4K20 trimethylation mark specific repetitive elements We next studied H3K9me3 and H4K20me3 , both of which have been associated with silencing of centromeres , transposons and tandem repeats 38 – 40 . We sought first to assess the relative enrichments of H3K9me3 and H4K20me3 across different types of repetitive ele - ments by aligning ChIP - Seq reads directly to consensus sequences for various repeat families ( , 40 million reads could be aligned this way ) . H3K9me3 and H4K20me3 show nearly identical patterns of enrichment in ES cells . The strongest enrichments are observed for telomeric , satellite and long terminal repeats ( LTRs ) .

In MEFs , H3K36me3 extends an additional 500kb upstream to an H3K4me3 site that seems to reflect an alternative promoter ( this site is bivalent in ES cells ) . b , H3K36me3 enrichment extends significantly downstream of Sox2 . Although highly active in ES cells , Sox2 is flanked by two bivalent CpG islands that may poise it for repression . c , d , H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 indicate two highly expressed non - coding RNAs ( c ) , and the putative primary transcript ( dashed line ) for a single annotated microRNA ( d ) . NATURE | Vol 448 | 2 August 2007 ARTICLES 557 Nature ©2007 PublishingGroup primarily reflects enrichment of intracisternal A - particle ( IAP ) and early transposon ( ETn ) elements ( Supplementary Fig . 8 ) . IAP and ETn elements are active in murine ES cells and produce double - stranded RNAs 41 , 42 . RNA has also been implicated in main - taining satellite and telomeric heterochromatin 38 . Hence , these enrichment dataare consistent with a global role for RNA in targeting repressive chromatin marks in mammalian ES cells , analogous to that observed in lower eukaryotes 38 , 39 . We next examined the distributions of H3K9me3 and H4K20me3 across unique sequences in the mouse genome . We identified , 1 , 800 H3K9me3 sites ( median size , 300bp ) in ES cells , with the vast major - ity also showing H4K20me3 . Fully 78 % of the sites lie within 2kb of a satelliterepeatorLTR ( primarilyIAPandETnelements ) . Thissuggests that repressive marks are capable of spreading from repeat insertions and could potentially regulate proximal unique sequence . Recent studies have described a handful of active genes with H3K9me3 and H4K20me3 , raising the possibility that these ‘repres - sive’ marks also function in transcriptional activation 31 , 32 . One - third of the , 1 , 800 H3K9me3 - enriched sites reside within an annotated gene , which is roughly the proportion expected by chance . However , H3K9me3 sites that are larger and / or more distant from LTRs are more likely to occur within genes ( Supplementary Fig . 9 ) . The largest genic site in ES cells ( , 6 kb ) coincides with the Polrmt gene ( Fig . 6d ) . This case is notable because the downstream gene ( Hcn2 ) is conver - gent and contains a CpG island at its 3 9 end . Transcription from 3 9 promoters has been proposed as a potential mechanism of transcrip - tional interference by producing antisense transcripts 23 . This example may therefore reflect a link between transcriptional inter - ference and H3K9me3 , as has been suggested for a few other mam - malian loci 43 , 44 . Our results thus confirm the presence of H3K9me3 within a subset of genes , although the functional implications remain to be elucidated . H3K4 and H3K9 trimethylation at imprinted loci We next studied chromatin marks associated with imprinting . This epigenetic process typically involves allele - specific DNA methylation of CpG - rich imprinting control regions 45 . Several reports have also described allele - specific chromatin modification at a handful of imprinting control regions , with H3K9me3 and H4K20me3 on the DNA methylated allele and H3K4me3 on the opposite allele 46 , 47 . We searched for regions showing overlapping H3K9me3 and H3K4me3 in ES cells . Notably , 13 of the top 20 sites , as ranked by enrichment of the two marks , are located within known imprinted regions , coincident with imprinting control regions or imprinted gene promoters . An example is the Peg13 promoter ( Fig . 6c ) . Con - versely , of the , 20 known and putative autosomal imprinted loci that contain imprinting control regions , 17 have at least one with the overlapping chromatin marks ( Supplementary Table 7 ) . We con - clude that overlapping H3K9me3 and H3K4me3 is a common sig - nature of imprinting control regions in ES cells . Allele - specific histone methylation To explore the feasibility of inferring allele - specific chromatin states , we constructed chromatin - state maps in male ES cells derived from a more distant cross ( 129SvJae ( maternal ) x Mus musculus castaneus ( paternal ) ) , and used a catalogue of , 3 . 5 million single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) to assign ChIP - Seq reads to one of the two parental alleles . As a positive control , we first compared results for chromosome X and the autosomes for reads derived by H3K4me3 ChIP .

The allele specificity of this transcript is read out using ChIP - Seq data for hybrid ES cells and a SNP catalogue . The H3K36me3 reads overwhelmingly correspond to maternal 129SvJae alleles , consistent with the known maternal expression of these microRNAs 36 . b , In contrast , a non - imprinted transcript shows roughly equal proportions of reads assigned to 129SvJaeand M . m . castaneus alleles . c , Peg13 is marked by H3K4me3 and H3K9me3 in ES cells ; 19 out of 21 H3K4me3 reads correspond to the paternal M . m . castaneus allele , whereas 6 out of 6 H3K9me3 reads correspond to the maternal 129SvJae allele , consistent with paternal expression of this gene . d , H3K9me3 and H4K20me3 enrichment evident at the Polrmt gene may reflect transcriptional interference owing to antisense transcription from the 3 9 UTR CpG island of Hcn2 ( see text ) . ARTICLES NATURE | Vol 448 | 2 August 2007 558 Nature ©2007 PublishingGroup ( 97 % ) of , 3 , 700 informative reads on chromosome X , and roughly half ( 57 % ) of the 178 , 000 informative reads on the autosomes , were assigned to the 129SvJae strain . These proportions correspond roughly to the expected 100 % and 50 % . We then examined the allelic distribution at overlapping H3K4me3 and H3K9me3 sites coincident with putative imprinting control regions ( see above ) . Six of the imprinting control regions had enough reads ( $ 10 ) containing SNPs to assess allelic bias . In every case , the SNPs showed significant bias in the expected direction ( P , 0 . 02 ; Fig . 6c and Supplementary Table 7 ) . We applied the same approach to search for allelic imbalance in intervals with significant H3K36me3 enrichment , which would pre - dict differential transcription of the two alleles . A striking interval corresponds to a microRNA cluster within the Dlk1 – Dio3 locus known to be imprinted in the embryo proper 36 ( Fig . 6a , b ) . Of the additional imprinted genes with H3K36me3 enrichment , four ( Snrpn , Grb10 , Impact , Peg3 ) had enough reads containing SNPs to assess allelic bias . In every case , the data showed significant bias in the expected direction ( P , 0 . 02 ) . The data also revealed novel instances of allele - specific transcription . For example , a transcript of unknown function ( BC054101 ) , first identified in trophoblast stem cells 48 , showed highly significant maternal bias for H3K36me3 , as well as H3K4me3 ( P , 10 2 15 ; Supplementary Fig . 10 ) . The results suggest that , with sufficiently deep coverage and dense SNP maps , ChIP - Seq will provide a powerful means for identifying allele - specific chromatin modifications . With data from reciprocal crosses , it should be possible to discriminate novel cases of imprint - ing from strain - specific differences . Discussion Genome - wide chromatin - state maps provide a rich source of information about cellular state , yielding insights beyond what is typically obtained by RNA expression profiling . Analysis of H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 allows recognition of promoters together with their complete transcription units . This should help to define alternative promoters and their usage in specific cell types ; identify the primary structure of genes encoding non - coding RNAs ; detect gene expression ( given the narrower dynamic range ) ; and detect allele - specific transcription . In addition , analysis of H3K9me3 and H4K20me3 should facilitate the study of heterochromatin , spreading and imprinting mechanisms . Most interestingly , analysis of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 provides a rich description of cellular state . Our results suggest that promoters may be classified as active , repressed or poised for alternative devel - opmental fates . Conceivably , chromatin state at key regulatory genes may suffice to describe developmental commitment and potential . Given the technical features of ChIP - Seq ( high throughput , low cost and input requirement ) , it is now appropriate to contemplate projects to generate catalogues of chromatin - state maps representing a wide range of human and mouse cell types . These should include varied developmental stages and lineages , from totipotent to termin - ally differentiated , with the aim of precisely defining cellular states at the epigenetic level and observing how they change over the course of normal development . Chromatin - state maps should also be system - atically catalogued from situations of abnormal development . Cancer cells are the most obvious targets , as they are frequently associated with epigenetic defects and many appear to have acquired character - istics of earlier developmental stages . A comprehensive public data - base of chromatin - state maps would be a valuable resource for the scientific community . METHODS SUMMARY Murine V6 . 5 ES cells ( 129SvJae 3 C57BL / 6 ; male ) , hybrid ES cells ( 129SvJae 3 M . m . castaneus F 1 ; male ) andNPCswereculturedasdescribed 8 , 9 . PrimaryMEFs ( 129SvJae 3 C57BL / 6 ; male ) were obtained at embryonic day ( E ) 13 . 5 . ChIP experiments were carried out as described 15 . Sequencing libraries were generatedfrom1 – 10ngofChIPDNAbyadaptorligation , gelpurificationand18 cycles of PCR . Sequencing was carried out using the Illumina / Solexa Genome Analyzer system according to the manufacturer’s specifications . Reads were aligned to the reference genome , and the fragment count at any given position ( 25 - bp resolution ) was estimated as the number of uniquely aligned reads oriented towards it and within 300bp . Enriched intervals were identified by comparison of the mean fragment count in 1 - kb windows against asample - specific expecteddistributionestimatedbyrandomization ( H3K4me3 , H3K27me3 ) , or using a supervised Hidden Markov Model ( H3K36me3 , H3K9me3 , H4K20me3 ) . Promoters were inferred from full - length mouse RefSeqs . HCPs contain a 500 - bp interval within 2 0 . 5kb to 1 2kb with a ( G 1 C ) - fraction $ 0 . 55 and a CpG observed to expected ratio ( O / E ) $ 0 . 6 . LCPs contain no 500 - bp interval withCpGO / E $ 0 . 4 . Chromatinstatesofpromotersweredeterminedbyoverlap with H3K4me3 - and H3K27me3 - enriched intervals . Correlations with express - ion levels were calculated from the mean fragment count over each promoter or transcript . ES cell , NPC and MEF expression data were generated using GeneChip arrays ( Affymetrix ) and GenePattern ( http : / / www . broad . mit . edu / cancer / software / ) . Expression data for adult tissues were downloaded from Novartis ( http : / / symatlas . gnf . org ) . Repeat class enrichments were determined by aligning reads to consensus sequences ( http : / / www . girinst . org ) . Mouse SNP maps were obtained from Perlegen ( http : / / mouse . perlegen . com ) . Allele - specific bias was evaluated by a binomial test of the null hypothesis that ChIP fragments were drawn uniformly from both alleles .

V6 . 5 murine ES cells ( genotype 129SvJae 3 C57BL / 6 ; male ; pas - sages 10 – 15 ) and hybrid murine ES cells ( genotype 129SvJae 3 M . m . castaneus F 1 ; male ; passages 4 – 6 ) were cultivated in 5 % CO 2 at 37 u C on irradiated MEFs in DMEM containing 15 % FCS , leukaemia - inhibiting factor , penicillin / streptomycin , L - glutamine , nonessential amino acids and 2 - mercaptoethanol . Cells were subjected to at least two to three passages on 0 . 2 % gelatin under feeder - free conditions to exclude feeder contamination . V6 . 5 ES cells were dif - ferentiated into neural progenitor cells ( NPCs ) through embryoid body forma - tion for 4days and selection in ITSFn media for 5 – 7days , and maintained in FGF2andEGF2 ( R & DSystems ) asdescribed 8 . Thecellsuniformlyexpressnestin and Sox2 and can differentiate into neurons , astrocytes and oligodendrocytes . Mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( genotype 129SvJae 3 C57BL / 6 ; male ; E13 . 5 ; pas - sages 4 – 6 ) , were grown in DMEM with 10 % fetal bovine serum and penicillin / streptomycin at 37 u , 5 % CO 2 . Chromatin immunoprecipitation . ChIP experiments were carried out as described previously 15 and at http : / / www . upstate . com . Briefly , chromatin from fixed cells was fragmented to a size range of 200 – 700 bases with a Branson 250 Sonifier or a Diagenode Bioruptor . Solubilized chromatin was immunoprecipi - tated with antibody against H3K4me3 ( Abcam 8580 ) , H3K9me3 ( Abcam 8898 ) , H3K27me3 ( Upstate 07 - 449 ) , H3K36me3 ( Abcam 9050 ) , H4K20me3 ( Upstate 07 - 463 ) , pan - H3 ( Abcam 1791 ) or RNA polymerase II ( Covance MMS - 126R ) . Antibody – chromatin complexes were pulled - down using protein A - sepharose ( or anti - IgM - conjugated agarose for RNA polymerase II ) , washed and then eluted . After cross - link reversal and proteinase K treatment , immunoprecipi - tated DNA was extracted with phenol - chloroform , ethanol precipitated , and treated with RNase . ChIP DNA was quantified using PicoGreen . Library preparation and Solexa sequencing . One to ten nanograms of ChIP DNA ( or unenriched whole - cell extract ) were prepared for Solexa sequencing as follows : DNAfragmentswererepairedtobluntendsbyT4DNApolymeraseand phosphorylatedwithT4polynucleotidekinaseusingtheEND - ITkit ( Epicentre ) . Then , a single ‘A’ base was added to 3 9 ends with Klenow ( 3 9 R 5 9 exo 2 , 0 . 3U m l 2 1 ) . Double - stranded Solexa adaptors ( 75bp with a ‘T’ overhang ) were ligated to the fragments with DNA ligase ( 0 . 05U m l 2 1 ) . Ligation products between 275 and 700bp were gel purified on 2 % agarose to remove unligated adaptors , and subjected to 18 PCR cycles . Completed libraries were quantified with PicoGreen . DNA sequencing was carried out using the Illumina / Solexa Genome Analyzer sequencing system . Cluster amplification , linearization , blocking and sequen - cing primer reagents were provided in the Solexa Cluster Amplification kits and were used according to the manufacturer’s specifications as described here . To obtain single strand templates , the sample preparation was first denatured in NaOH ( 0 . 1N final concentration ) and diluted in Solexa hybridization buffer ( 4 u C ) to a final concentration of either 2 or 4pM . Sample loading was carried out as follows . A template sample was loaded into each lane of a Solexa flowcell mounted on a Solexa cluster station on which all subsequent steps were per - formed . The temperature was increased to 95 u C for 1min and slowly decreased to40 u Ctoallowforannealingontocomplementaryadaptoroligonucleotideson the flowcell surface . Cluster formation was then carried out as follows . The template strands were extended with Taq polymerase ( 0 . 25U m l 2 1 ) to generate a fixed copy of the template on the flowcell . The samples were then denatured with formamide ( Sigma - Aldrich , F - 5786 , . 99 . 5 % ( GC ) ) and washed ( Solexa Wash buffer ) to remove the original captured template , leaving behind a sin - gle - stranded template ready for amplification . Clusters were then amplified under isothermal conditions ( 60 u C ) for 30 cycles using Solexa amplification mix containing Bst I DNA polymerase ( 0 . 08U m l 2 1 ) . After each amplification cycle , thetemplatesweredenaturedwithformamide ( asabove ) . Freshamplifica - tionmixwasaddedaftereachdenaturationstep . Afteramplification , theclusters were linearized with Solexa linearization mix , and any unextended flowcell sur - face capture oligonucleotides were blocked with ddNTPs ( 2 . 4 m M mix in the presence of 0 . 25U m l 2 1 terminal transferase ) . The linearized clusters were then denatured ( 0 . 1N NaOH ) to remove and wash away the linearized strands . The single - stranded templates in the cluster were then annealed with the Solexa sequencingprimer ( 10 m M ) .

These computations are dynam - ically terminated so that only ‘unique’ alignments are reported , according to the following rule : if an alignment A has only x mismatches , and if there is no alternative alignment having # x 1 2 mismatches , then we call A unique . To minimize the risk of amplification bias , only one read was kept if multiple reads aligned to the same start point . For each ChIP ( or control ) experiment , we next estimate the number of end - sequenced ChIP fragments that overlap any given nucleotide position in the reference genome ( here , at 25 - bp resolution ) . For each position , we count the number of aligned reads that are oriented towards it and closer than the average length of a library fragment ( , 300bp ) . To identify the portion of the mouse genome that can be interrogated with SMSreadsofagivenlength ( k ) andalignmentstringency , wealignedevery k - mer that occurs in the reference sequence ( mm8 ) using the same pipeline as for SMS reads . Nucleotide positions in the reference genome where less than 50 % of the 200 flanking k - mers on each side had ‘unique’ alignments were masked as repet - itiveand disregardedfromfurther analysis ( , 28 % of the genome ) . Althoughwe analysedreadsspanning27 – 36bp , alldatawereconservativelymaskedat k 5 27 . Weidentifiedgenomicintervalsenrichedwithaspecificchromatinmarkfrom the mean fragment count in 1 - kb sliding windows . To account for varying read numbers and lengths , we generated sample - specific expected distributions of fragment counts under the null hypothesis of no enrichment by moving each aligned read to a randomly chosen ‘unique’ position on the same chromosome . Nominal P - values for enrichment at a particular position were obtained by comparison to a randomized version of the same data set ( due to the large numberof reads , multiplerandomizations gaveidenticalresults ) . Genome - wide maps of enriched sites were created by identification of windows where the nominal P - value fell below 10 2 5 , and merging any enriched windows that were lessthan1 - kbapartintocontinuousintervals . Toimprovesensitivitytothemore diffuse enrichment observed from H3K9me3 and H4K20me3 near repetitive regions and from H3K36me3 across large transcripts , we also developed a HiddenMarkovModel ( HMM ) tosegmentthereferencegenomeinto‘enriched’ and ‘unenriched’ intervals ( R . P . K . , manuscript in preparation ) . The observed fragment densities were divided into four categories , in a sample - dependent manner ( ‘masked’ , ‘sub - threshold’ , ‘near - threshold’ and ‘above threshold’ ) . Emission and transition probabilities were fitted using supervised learning on limited intervals ( , 10Mb total ) chosen to reflect diverse chromatin landscapes , and the resultant models were applied genome wide . Validation of ChIP - Seq by comparison to ChIP - chip and real - time PCR . ChIP - Seq data for H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 in ES cells were compared to published ChIP - chip profiles across , 2 % of the mouse genome 9 . Significantly enriched sites in the ChIP - chip data were defined using a previously validated P - valuethresholdof10 2 4 , andcomparedtotheChIP - Seqsites . Inaddition , aset of 50 PCR primer pairs ( Supplementary Table 2 ) was designed to amplify 100 – 140 - bp fragments from genomic regions showing a wide range of signals for H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 by ChIP - Seq . Real - time PCR was carried out using QuantitectSYBRgreenPCRmix ( Qiagen ) ona7000ABIdetectionsystem , using 0 . 25ng ChIP or WCE DNA as template . Fold enrichments reflecttwo independ - ent ChIP assays , each evaluated in duplicate by real - time PCR . Promoter classification and definition of gene and transcript intervals . The analysed promoters were based on transcription start sites inferred from full - length mouse RefSeqs ( downloaded from the UCSC Genome Brower 2 April 2007 ) . Promoters containing a 500 - bp interval within 2 0 . 5kb to 1 2kb with a ( G 1 C ) - fraction $ 0 . 55 and a CpG observed to expected ratio ( O / E ) $ 0 . 6 were classifiedasHCPs . Promoterscontainingno500 - bpintervalwithCpGO / E $ 0 . 4 were classified as LCPs . The remainder were classified as ICPs . The chromatin states of promoters were determined by overlap with cell - type - specific H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 intervals . For comparison with expression levels , the chromatin states of genes with more than one known promoter were clas - sified according to the most ‘active’ mark ( that is , a gene with an H3K4me3 marked promoter and a bivalent promoter would be classified as ‘H3K4me3’ ) . Correlation between H3K4me3 enrichment and expression levels was calculated from the mean fragment density over each promoter from 2 0 . 5kb to 1 1kb . Correlation between H3K36me3 and expression levels was calculated from the mean fragment density over each RefSeq transcript . Expression data . RNA expression data for ES cells , NPCs and MEFs were gen - erated from polyA RNA using GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2 . 0 Arrays ( Affymetrix ) . Expression data for adult tissues were downloaded from the Novartis Gene Expression Atlas at http : / / symatlas . gnf . org . Pre - processing , nor - malization ( GC - RMA ) and hierarchical clustering ( Pearson , log - transformed , row - centred values ) were performed using GenePattern ( http : / / www . broad . mit . edu / cancer / software / ) . doi : 10 . 1038 / nature06008 Nature ©2007 PublishingGroup Analysis of repetitive elements . Chromatin state at repetitive elements was evaluated by aligning SMS reads directly to a library of repetitive element consensus sequences ( http : / / www . girinst . org ) . The proportion of reads aligning to each class was calculated for H3K9me3 and H4K20me3 , and enrichment determined by comparison to WCEand pan - H3 . Wealso appliedan orthogonal approach based on HMM intervals of H3K9me3 in unique sequences ( see above ) . For each repetitive element type or class , we calculated the number of occurrences within 1kb of a unique H3K9me3 site , controlling against a set of randomly placed sites of the same length distribution . Allele - specific histone methylation . SNPs between the 129S1 / SvlmJ ( used as proxy for 129SvJae ) and M . m . castaneus mouse strains were obtained from Perlegen at http : / / mouse . perlegen . com . Allele - specific bias was evaluated by a binomial test of the null hypothesis that ChIP fragments were drawn uniformly from both alleles . ( H3K4me3 and H3K9me3 reads were pooled before the test , see Supplementary Table 7 . ) We note that the 129SvJae strain is closer to the C57BL / 6 - derived reference genome , and this may cause a slight bias towards assigning aligned reads to this strain . To minimize this bias , aligned reads were keptforanalysisifno alternative alignment hadthesamenumberof mismatches to the reference sequence . doi : 10 . 1038 / nature06008 Nature ©2007 PublishingGroup
