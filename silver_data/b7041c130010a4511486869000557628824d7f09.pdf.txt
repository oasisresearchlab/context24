The most common neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis has juvenile onset with rapid onset blindness and progressive degeneration of cognitive processes . The juvenile form is caused by mutations in the CLN3 gene , which encodes the protein CLN3 . While mouse models of Cln3 deficiency show mild disease phenotypes , it is apparent from patient tissue - and cell - based studies that its loss impacts many cellular processes . Using Cln3 deficient mice , we previously described defects in mouse brain endothelial cells and blood - brain barrier ( BBB ) permeability . Here we expand on this to other components of the BBB and show that Cln3 deficient mice have increased astrocyte endfeet area . Interestingly , this phenotype is corrected by treatment with a commonly used GAP junction inhibitor , carbenoxolone ( CBX ) . In addition to its action on GAP junctions , CBX has also been proposed to alter lipid microdomains . In this work , we show that CBX modifies lipid microdomains and corrects membrane fluidity alterations in Cln3 deficient endothelial cells , which in turn improves defects in endocytosis , caveolin - 1 distribution at the plasma membrane , and Cdc42 activity . In further work using the NIH Library of Integrated Network - based Cellular Signatures ( LINCS ) , we discovered other small molecules whose impact was similar to CBX in that they improved Cln3 - deficient cell phenotypes . Moreover , Cln3 deficient mice treated orally with CBX exhibited recovery of impaired BBB responses and reduced autofluorescence . CBX and the compounds identified by LINCS , many of which have been used in humans or approved for other ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT A C C EP T E D M A N U S C R I P T indications , may find therapeutic benefit in children suffering from CLN3 deficiency through mechanisms independent of their original intended use . Keywords : Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinoses , JNCL , CLN3 , Cav - 1 , Cdc42 , blood - brain barrier , carbenoxolone , membrane fluidity ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT A C C EP T E D M A N U S C R I P T Introduction The neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses ( NCLs ) are progressive neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the accumulation of autofluorescent material in multiple cell types . The most common NCL has a juvenile onset and is commonly caused by mutations in CLN3 ( referred to as CLN3 deficiency ) ( Williams and Mole , 2012 ) . CLN3 deficiency generally manifests with early visual deficits followed several years later by seizures with mental and physical decline ( Phillips et al . , 2005 ) . To date , only palliative care is available for this invariably fatal disease . The CLN3 gene encodes the protein CLN3 ( also known as battenin ) , which is a 438 amino acid hydrophobic , multi - pass transmembrane protein of unresolved function ( Cotman and Staropoli , 2012 ; Phillips et al . , 2005 ) . Work in model systems over the last two decades suggest that CLN3 impacts multiple cellular functions including lysosomal pH ( Golabek et al . , 2000 ; Holopainen et al . , 2001 ; Pearce et al . , 1999 ; Pearce and Sherman , 1998 ) , vesicular trafficking ( Cao et al . , 2006 ; Codlin and Mole , 2009 ; Fossale et al . , 2004 ; Kama et al . , 2011 ; Metcalf et al . , 2008 ) , palmitoyl desaturase activity ( Narayan et al . , 2006 ) , endocytosis ( Codlin et al . , 2008 ; Fossale et al . , 2004 ; Luiro et al . , 2001 ; Luiro et al . , 2004 ; Schultz et al . , 2014 ; Tecedor et al . , 2013 ; Vidal - Donet et al . , 2013 ) , and membrane microdomain formation or stability ( Tecedor et al . , 2013 ) . Using a Cln3 reporter mouse we previously showed that Cln3 is highly expressed in brain vasculature endothelial cells ( Eliason et al . , 2007 ) . Brain endothelial cells are a component of the blood - brain barrier ( BBB ) and are vital for the maintenance of ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT A C C EP T E D M A N U S C R I P T neuronal health and CNS function . In some neurodegenerative diseases , such as Alzheimer’s disease , endothelial cell dysfunction ( Sagare et al . , 2013 ) at the BBB is a critical element in disease pathogenesis . Intriguingly , CLN3 disease patients and mouse models display autoantibodies against CNS antigens in peripheral blood . Concurrently , high levels of storage material accumulate in endothelial cells ( Lamb et al . , 2006 ; Lim et al . , 2007 ) . Additionally , Cln3 - null mice have abnormal BBB responses to hypotonic stress in vivo ( Tecedor et al . , 2013 ) . Whether other components of the BBB , for example astrocytes whose endfeet are a constituent of the BBB , are affected in CLN3 deficiency is not known . Here , we report that Cln3 - null mice have increased astrocyte endfeet area in the BBB . Increased astrocyte endfeet size could reflect defects in astrocyte communication , which occurs at GAP junctions . Indeed prior work in slice culture models have shown excessive astrocytic GAP junction connectivity ( Burkovetskaya et al . , 2014 ) . Interestingly , we found that oral treatment of Cln3 - / - mice with the GAP junction inhibitor Carbenoxolone ( CBX ) significantly corrects astrocyte endfeet area . CBX exerts its impact on GAP junction / hemichannel activity upon intercalation into the plasma membrane , which likely alters membrane microfluidity ( Davidson and Baumgarten , 1988 ; Goldberg et al . , 1996 ; Tovar et al . , 2009 ) . Interestingly , we previously described altered plasma membrane fluidity in endothelial cells derived from Cln3 - / - mice ( Tecedor et al . , 2013 ) . ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT A C C EP T E D M A N U S C R I P T We next tested the hypothesis that CBX improves Cln3 phenotypes in vitro and in vivo by improving membrane fluidity defects . Our results show that , in vitro , CBX corrects previously reported lipid microdomain changes , caveolar and fluid phase endocytosis defects , and other downstream cellular pathologies reported in Cln3 - / - mice cells including altered Cdc42 - GTP levels . In vivo , CBX corrected altered BBB responses in Cln3 deficient mice in addition to improving astrocyte endfeet phenotypes . Also , we took advantage of the NIH Library of Integrated Network - based Cellular Signatures ( LINCS ) database to identify other compounds that behave similarly to CBX in model systems . Overall our data present evidence supporting further testing of 7 compounds for potential treatment for CLN3 deficiency . ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT A C C EP T E D M A N U S C R I P T Materials and Methods Mice All animal experiments were approved by the University of Iowa animal care and use committee and conducted in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines . Here we used ( WT ) , Cln3 lacZ / + ( Cln3 - / + ) , and Cln3 lacZ / lacZ ( Cln3 - / - ) mice ( Eliason et al . , 2007 ) backcrossed to the C57BL / 6J background . Mixes of male and female mice were used for experiments . MBEC cell lines Due to the low yield of primary MBECs , we used previously described immortalized MBEC from Cln3 - / - mice ( Tecedor et al . , 2013 ) . Cln3 expression was stably restored in Cln3 - / - MBEC using a lentivirus vector as described previously ( Tecedor et al . , 2013 ) , creating the Cln3 R , sister cell line . Cln3 R and Cln3 - / - MBECs behave similarly to primary wildtype and Cln3 - / - MBECs ( Schultz et al . , 2014 ; Tecedor et al . , 2013 ) . Immortalized MBECs are positive for Von Willebrand factor and ZO - 1 ( Tecedor et al . , 2013 ) . FRAP Membrane fluidity Cells were incubated with Alexa 488 - CTB ( Invitrogen ) in the dark for 30 minutes on ice . Cells were briefly rinsed with ice - cold media and placed on ice in the dark until use . Imaging and photobleaching were conducted on a Zeiss LSM510 microscope ( Carl Zeiss ) equipped with an Ar 488 nm laser . 60 iterations at 100 % of 488 nm excitation was used to photobleach a small portion ( 31 pixel diameter ) of the membrane . Adjacent ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT A C C EP T E D M A N U S C R I P T non photobleached membrane areas of the same size were used as a control for sequential bleaching as previously described ( Tecedor et al . , 2013 ) . GAP junction connectivity MBECs were incubated with 5 µM calcein - AM ( Molecular probes ) for 30 minutes at 37°C in the dark , then rinsed briefly with cold cell culture media . Whole cells were photobleached as described above in the Membrane fluidity section . Post - bleached images were captured every 5s . Neighboring cells were used as controls for sequential bleaching due to the imaging process . FRAP was quantified as described previously ( Kenworthy , 2007 ) . Results from three independent experiments were analyzed together ( n = 76 , 42 , 52 , 52 for Cln3 - / - , Cln3 R , Cln3 - / - + CBX , Cln3 R + CBX respectively ) . Two - way ANOVA resulted with significant interaction . Data was analyzed for each time point by one - way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post - hoc analysis . Cholesterol quantification Detergent - free carbonate extraction and discontinuous sucrose density centrifugation was used to enrich plasma membrane and separate lipid microdomain fractions as before ( Tecedor et al . , 2013 ) . Cholesterol was quantified by amplex red assay ( Life Technologies ) . Briefly , cell fractions were diluted in reaction buffer and incubated with the amplex red reagent per the manufactures instructions . Cholesterol intensity was quantified for each membrane fraction with a monochrome microplate reader Safire2 ( Tecan Group Ltd . Mannedorf , Switzerland ) . Results were normalized to total amount of quantified cholesterol per the manufacturer’s instructions . ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT A C C EP T E D M A N U S C R I P T Cdc42 - GTP analysis The Cdc42 G - Lisa ® from Cytoskeleton Inc . was utilized for measurement of Cdc42 - GTP levels . Briefly , 0 . 8 mg / ml of snap frozen lysate was incubated in the ELISA plate and the manufactures instructions were followed for detection and analysis as previously described ( Schultz et al . , 2014 ) . Data were normalized to the protein standard and significance was tested by one - way ANOVA with Tukey post - hoc analysis . Fluid - phase endocytosis Subconfluent cells were incubated with 0 . 5 mg / ml Alexa 488 10 , 000 MW dextran ( Invitrogen ) for 20 minutes . Then cells were briefly washed 3X with 37° PBS to remove unbound dextran and immediately fixed with 4 % PFA at 37°C . Membrane impermeable 200 mM Red - 40 was added to quench extra cellular dextran signal allowing quantification of only internalized dextran ( Schultz et al . , 2014 ) . Cells were immediately imaged on an Olympus IX81 microscope and fluorescent intensity was calculated by ImageJ . Significance was determined by a one - way ANOVA with Tukey post - hoc ( Fig . 5C ) analysis or one - way ANOVA with Holm - Sidak’s multiple comparisons post - hoc ( Fig . 6B ) comparing each treatment with the CLN3 - / - MBEC + vehicle group . Scratch assay MBECs were grown to confluence and a pipette tip was used to create a wound . Cells were briefly washed with PBS and cell culture media was added for the remainder of the experiment . Cells were imaged every hour on an automated live cell Olympus IX81 ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT A C C EP T E D M A N U S C R I P T microscope overnight . T - Scratch software ( Geback et al . , 2009 ) was used to quantify wound closure . Significance was assessed by 2 - way ANOVA with Bonferroni post - hoc test ( Schultz et al . , 2014 ) . Immunofluorescence Sub - confluent MBECs were briefly washed and fixed in 4 % PFA , permeabilized with 0 . 01 % Trition - X - 100 , washed three times with PBS , and blocked for 1 hour with 2 % goat serum . Cells were incubated overnight with Cav - 1 antibody ( 1 : 200 ) Abcam , washed three times , and incubated with goat anti - rabbit Alexa 488 secondary for 45 minutes . After mounting with Vectashield , cells were imaged on a Zeiss 710 confocal microscope . Protein analysis Three confluent 160 - mm - diameter dishes of MBECs were harvested and plasma membranes were isolated as previously described ( Yao et al . , 2009 ) . Protein concentrations were determined by Bio - Rad Dc - Protein assay ( Bio - Rad ) . Samples were mixed with Bio - Rad XT sample buffer and reducing agent , run on Criterion™ XT 4 - 12 % Bis - Tris Gels ( Bio - Rad ) , and transferred onto PVDF membranes . Immunodetection was performed with ( 1 : 100 ) rabbit anti - connexin 43 antibody ( Invitrogen ) , ( 1 : 500 ) mouse anti phospho - caveolin1 ( pY14 ) ( BD Transduction Laboratories ) , ( 1 : 5000 ) rabbit anti - ß - catenin ( Abcam ) , ( 1 : 1000 ) rabbit anti - Cav - 1 ( Abcam ) , or ( 1 : 1000 ) mouse - anti - transferrin receptor ( Life Technology ) followed by HRP - coupled secondary antibodies ( Jackson ImmunoResearch ) , and developed with ECL - Plus ( GE Healthcare ) . Protein bands were ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT A C C EP T E D M A N U S C R I P T quantified by densitometry using Image Lab 5 . 1 ( Bio - Rad ) software . Plasma membrane connexin43 levels were normalized to plasma membrane transferrin receptor . This value was normalized to total ß - catenin as a housekeeping reference protein . BBB hypotonic treatment Mice were anesthetized and perfused with a Gilson minipulse 3 pump ( set to a speed of 2 ) . We sequentially perfused i ) 175 µl Alexafluor 488 WGA ( 1 mg / ml ) ( preloaded into the needle ) ; ii ) Hoechst 33258 ( 100 µg / ml in 1mM CaCl 2 hypotonic solution ) , injected for 2 minutes and 15 seconds ; iii ) saline , perfused for 30 seconds ; iv ) 4 % PFA , perfused for 2 minutes . Each solution was passed through an IV drip tube to create continuous flow and pressure . After dissection and removal , brains were post - fixed in 4 % PFA for 3 hours , embedded in agar and set on ice to solidify . Solidified blocks were trimmed and further post - fixed in 4 % PFA at 4°C overnight . 50 - µm vibratome sections were mounted onto slides , coverslipped with Fluorogel and immediately imaged on a Leica Leitz DMRBE microscope or Zeiss LSM710 confocal microscope . Images were captured in the green ( WGA ) , blue ( Hoechst ) , and red ( autofluorescence ) channels and channels combined in Adobe Photoshop . Astrocyte endfeet quantification 3 mice per group were perfused with 2 . 5 % glutaraldehyde in 0 . 1 M sodium cacodylate buffer using a Gilson minipulse 3 at ~ 1 . 3 ml / min flow ratio for maintaining BBB integrity . Motor cortex samples of 1mm 2 were collected , and 50 µm vibrotome sections were obtained . Samples were then postfixed in 1 % osmium tetroxide for 1 hr . , stained with ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT A C C EP T E D M A N U S C R I P T uranyl acetate , dehydrated in a graded ethanol series , and embedded in Epon resin . Ultrathin 70 nm sections were cut on a Leica UC6 ultramicrotome ( Leica Microsystems ) and 12 - 23 cortical capillaries per animal analyzed with a 1230 JEOL - JEM transmission EM ( Jeol USA ) or a Zeiss Libra 120 transmission EM . Microvasculature was recognized by detecting the basal lamina which is localized between endothelial cells and astrocytic endfeet . Only long processes surrounding the basal lamina were measured to exclude neuronal terminals . The area surrounded by astrocytic endfeet plasma membrane was measured using ImageJ software ( NIH ) . Endfeet data did not follow a normal distribution so it was normalized by lognormal transformation . Statistical significance of the normalized data was tested by two - tailed t - test . Autofluorescence Brains were collected as explained above in the BBB hypotonic treatment method . From each brain , 20 X images were taken from four different sections of medial cortex . Autofluorescence images were collected in the red channel and intensity calculated using ImageJ . Significance was calculated by a one - way ANOVA with Tukey post - hoc analysis . Drug treatment Carbenoxolone disodium salt ( Abcam ) was dissolved to 0 . 5 M in ethanol : water ( 1 : 1 ) , and further diluted in cell culture media to obtain the following final concentrations and treatment durations : 50 µM for 2 hrs . ( G - LISA ) , 25 µM for ( 30 minutes fluid - phase endocytosis ; 2 hrs . FRAP , cholesterol , cav - 1 trafficking ) , and 3 µM overnight ( scratch assay ) . In the multidrug screening experiment , CBX was dissolved with DMSO and ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT A C C EP T E D M A N U S C R I P T diluted in cell culture media to a final concentration of 3 µM for a 24 hrs . treatment . For in vivo experiments , a 30 mg / ml stock solution of carbenoxolone was prepared in saline ( vehicle ) and diluted to 2 . 0 mg / ml for gavage . Mice were administered 20 mg / kg CBX or vehicle by gavage , given at the same time each morning for 14 days . Enoxenolone ( Enx , Abcam ) was dissolved in ethanol : water ( 1 : 1 ) and diluted in cell culture media to a final concentration of 3 µM . Drugs tested in the multidrug screening test were dissolved in DMSO and then diluted in cell culture media for 24 hrs . treatment . Experimental concentrations matched those recommended on the LINCLs database : Prednisolone ( Prd , Sigma - Aldrich ) and  - ketocholesterol (  - KC , Sigma - Aldrich ) at 10 µM , BRD - K95814727 ( K8 , Broad Institute ) , - K30446755 ( K4 , Broad Institute ) , - K33258928 ( K2 , Broad Institute ) at 5 µM , and BRD - K95985487 ( K9 , Broad Institute ) at 0 . 5 µM . LINCS database analyses Cln3 - / - MBE cells were treated with 3 µM CBX or no - treatment for 18 hrs . , following which RNA was harvested from 6 wells per condition using the mirVana TM total RNA isolation kit procedure . Total RNA was tested for quality on an Agilent Model 2100 Bioanalyzer ( Agilent Technologies ) , and gene expression profiles were generated using the MouseRef - 8 V2 BeadChip Kit ( Illumina ) . ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT A C C EP T E D M A N U S C R I P T Differential gene expression analysis was performed using the Partek ® Genomics Suite ® , Gene Expression workflow to identify the most significant up - and down - regulated genes . LINCS queries are based on a set of 1000 landmark genes which are representative of the whole transcriptome . To acquire the required number of genes we used a p value cutoff < 0 . 02 and > 1 . 2 gave roughly 200 genes in each category , which is required for reaching 150 - 200 up or down regulated landmark genes for the query . The fold changes of the genes were then uploaded onto the Apps . lincscloud . org / start ( now https : / / clue . io / ) to query the LINCS database . Every reference signature in the database is compared with the query signatures and given a score termed the “connectivity score” based on the extent of similarity between the two . Scores range from + 1 meaning higher similarity , to 0 meaning no similarity , to - 1 meaning opposite similarity . We removed all non - compounds and negative connectivity scores , and sorted the remaining compounds by connectivity score alone . We prioritized the top 70 compounds with the highest connectivity score for further analysis . Experimental design and statistical analysis Data are presented as mean ± s . e . m . with p values , and sample size ( n ) . Prism v6 ( GraphPad Software ) was used for statistical analyses . Comparisons between different datasets were made depending on data distribution tested by the D’Agostino normality test . Parametric tests were used for normally distributed data ( two - tailed t - test for comparing two groups and ANOVA for comparing three or more groups ) . A two - way ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT A C C EP T E D M A N U S C R I P T ANOVA was used to determine significance in experiments with multiple time points and groups . When a significant interaction was found between factors by two - way ANOVA , one - way ANOVA were used to determine significance between experimental groups . When the normality assumption was violated , nonparametric tests were performed ( Mann - Whitney test for two groups and Kruskal - Wallis for three or more groups ) unless the n was high enough to allow the transformation of the data to a normal distribution using lognormal function . Differences were considered statistically significant at p < 0 . 05 . Different levels of significance between groups were denoted as * p < 0 . 05 , * * p < 0 . 01 , * * * p < 0 . 001 , * * * * p < 0 . 0001 Results An astrocyte endfeet phenotype in CLN3 - null mice is corrected by CBX At the BBB , astrocytes and brain endothelial cells are juxtaposed at astrocyte endfeet , which together serve to regulate BBB maintenance and function ( Abbott et al . , 2006 ) . As we previously described structural alterations in mouse brain endothelia in vivo ( Tecedor et al . , 2013 ) , we next tested cerebral sections for structural changes in Cln3 - / - mice astrocytes . Transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) analysis revealed astrocyte endfeet area in Cln3 - / - mice was significantly increased at 0 . 2661 µm 2 ( ±0 . 03003 ) compared to 0 . 0003332 µm 2 ( ±0 . 02956 ) in Cln3 + / + littermates ( Fig . 1A ) . Given prior work showing impaired GAP junction connectivity in JNCL astrocytes ( Burkovetskaya et al . , 2014 ) we subsequently tested if treating Cln3 - / - mice with the GAP junction inhibitor carbenoxolone ( CBX ) could impact this phenotype . CBX was administered daily to Cln3 - / - mice or normal littermates for two weeks by oral gavage , ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT A C C EP T E D M A N U S C R I P T and endfeet area assessed as before by TEM . CBX reduced astrocyte endfeet area in Cln3 - / - mice to 0 . 1291 µm 2 ( ±0 . 03120 ) , which is similar to that found in control littermates ( 0 . 01833 ± 0 . 03310 µm 2 ; Fig . 1B ) . CBX modifies microdomain fluidity . Gap junctions are produced by coupling the plasma membrane - resident hemichannels of adjacent cells allowing the exchange of cytoplasmic molecules and electrical signals . Due to the crosstalk between astrocytes and brain endothelial cells , we investigated in vitro GAP junction activity in brain endothelial cells derived from Cln3 - / - mice . We used our previously established mouse brain endothelial cell lines ( MBECs ) for this work ; this includes a Cln3 - null line ( Cln3 - / - MBECs ) , and a line in which Cln3 expression was restored ( Cln3 R MBECs ) . These cells behave similarly to primary MBECs from null or WT mice , respectively ( Schultz et al . , 2014 ; Tecedor et al . , 2013 ) . To study the impact of Cln3 deficiency on GAP junction connectivity , MBEC monolayer cultures were incubated with calcein - AM , which moves between cells using GAP junctions and the cell - cell transfer rate quantified using whole cell fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) . For FRAP , the fluorescent calcein - AM in one cell is photobleached and then sequential images taken to determine the rate by which the dye enters the photobleached cell from neighboring cells . FRAP analysis revealed that Cln3 - / - cells have a faster calcein - AM fluorescence recovery ( one - way ANOVA , F ( 3 , 112 ) = 30 . 22 , p < 0 . 0001 ) relative to Cln3 R cells , indicating increased flow of calcium - AM through GAP junctions with neighboring cells ( Fig . 2A ) . As expected , treating cells with the purported GAP junction inhibitor CBX blunted the rate of fluorescence recovery ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT A C C EP T E D M A N U S C R I P T in the photobleached cells ( Fig . 2A ) . Connexin 43 ( Cx43 ) levels , which is a main component of GAP junctions in the brain , were similar between Cln3 - / - and Cln3 R MBECs ( Fig . 2B ; Kruskal - Wallis , p = 0 . 1085 ) . This indicates that increased GAP junction activity is not caused by more Cx43 protein and suggests another mechanism for increased calcium - AM flow . Although CBX is commonly used as a GAP junction inhibitor , data also support the notion that it directly modifies cell membranes . A dministration of CBX to purified lysosomes stabilizes membranes ( Porta et al . , 1986 ; Symons et al . , 1978 ) , and incubation of enveloped viral particles with CBX reduces adsorption ( Dargan and Subak - Sharpe , 1986 ) and viral release ( Dargan and Subak - Sharpe , 1986 ) . As GAP junctions are associated with cholesterol - rich domains ( Schubert et al . , 2002 ) and regulated by membrane fluidity ( Bastiaanse et al . , 1993 ) , we tested if CBX influences lipid microdomain dynamics by evaluating GM1 ganglioside movement in the plasma membrane . GM1 gangliosides were labeled in living MBECs with Alexa - 488 - cholera toxin subunit B ( A488 - CTB ) and a high intensity laser was used to photobleach a A488 - CTB - positive region of the plasma membrane . Sequential images were captured to assess the rate of A488 - CTB movement into the photobleached area . Consistent with our previous report ( Tecedor et al . , 2013 ) , Cln3 - / - MBECs displayed significantly faster recovery compared to Cln3 R cells , indicating enhanced membrane fluidity ( Fig . 3A ) . When MBECs were tested after 2 hours of CBX treatment , fluorescence recovery in Cln3 - / - cells was normalized ( one - way ANOVA F ( 3 , 108 ) = 18 . 10 , p < 0 . 0001 ) ( Fig . 3A ) . To determine if CBX corrects the previously described abnormal distribution of microdomain lipids ( Tecedor et al . , 2013 ) , plasma membranes were isolated and ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT A C C EP T E D M A N U S C R I P T fractionated over sucrose gradients using a detergent - free extraction method and cholesterol levels quantified . Similar to our earlier data ( Tecedor et al . , 2013 ) , Cln3 - / - MBECs demonstrated cholesterol partitioning into more buoyant fractions , with the highest concentration found in the first ( lightest ) fraction compared to a cholesterol peak in the second fraction for Cln3 R MBEC ( two - way ANOVA of “membrane fraction” factor F ( 11 , 96 ) = 60 . 30 , p < 0 . 0001 ; Fig . 3B ) . Pretreatment with CBX normalized the profile of Cln3 - / - MBECs such that cholesterol concentration peaked in fraction 2 . ( Fig . 3B , Fig . S1 ) . Cumulatively , these data support a model where CBX is a novel modifier of lipid microdomains . Interestingly , CBX did not significantly alter microdomain dynamics or the partitioning of cholesterol in Cln3 R MBECs . CBX restores Cav - 1 plasma membrane distribution Since CBX corrected membrane fluidity dynamics in Cln3 - / - MBECs , we subsequently investigated if CBX corrects caveolar defects . Caveolae are flask - shaped invaginations that form within distinct cholesterol / sphingolipid - enriched lipid microdomains on the plasma membrane . Caveolae are common in BBB endothelia , where they serve as signaling platforms , mediate endocytosis , and transcytosis . The primary structural protein of caveolae is caveolin - 1 ( Cav - 1 ) . Cav - 1 inserts into membranes at the ER and traffics through the Golgi where high - order oligomerization drives transport to the plasma membrane ( Chadda et al . , 2007 ) . We previously found enhanced microdomain fluidity in Cln3 - / - MBECs and modified Cav - 1 distribution as assessed by fractionation and immunofluorescence of the plasma membrane . Altered ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT A C C EP T E D M A N U S C R I P T plasma membrane Cav - 1 distribution causes reduced caveolae formation in vitro and in vivo ( Tecedor et al . , 2013 ) . As shown in Fig . 4 , CBX treatment of Cln3 - / - MBECs increased Cav - 1 immunosignal at the plasma membrane , evaluated by immunocytochemistry ( Fig . 4A ) ; western blot analysis of membrane enriched fractions showed no differences in Cav - 1 protein levels ( one - way ANOVA , F ( 3 , 20 ) = 0 . 3744 , p = 0 . 7724 ; Fig . 4B ) implying that trafficking not protein expression levels were impacted by CBX treatment . The corrective effect of CBX on these phenotypes is similar to our prior work where addition of exogenous lipids recovered Cav - 1 plasma membrane localization ( Tecedor et al . , 2013 ) . Cumulatively , the data support that CBX is acting to modify membranes in MBECs . CBX corrects Cdc42 - dependent defects in Cln3 - / - MBECs In addition to caveolar endocytosis , Cln3 - / - MBECs have decreased levels of fluid - phase endocytosis ( FPE ) and increased GTP - loaded Cdc42 ( Schultz et al . , 2014 ) . Cdc42 is a small GTPase that cycles between GTP - bound ( active , effector - binding ) and GDP - bound ( inactive ) states ( Chadda et al . , 2007 ; Nevins and Thurmond , 2006 ; Rojas et al . , 2001 ) . Cdc42 GTP - to - GDP cycling is required for fluid - phase endocytosis and cell migration , both of which are reduced in Cln3 - / - cells ( Schultz et al . , 2014 ) . This suggests that inefficient cycling of Cdc42 to the “off” state underlies multiple actin - related defects in MBEC , and suggests further that drugs able to promote cycling may have beneficial effects . We incubated subconfluent MBECs with CBX and quantified Cdc42 - GTP levels . As expected , in vehicle - treated cells , active Cdc42 levels were significantly higher in Cln3 - / - ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT A C C EP T E D M A N U S C R I P T compared to Cln3 R MBECs ( Figure 5A ) . In Cln3 R MBECs , CBX did not significantly alter Cdc42 - GTP levels ( Fig . 5A ) , likely due to the already low baseline levels of Cdc42 - GTP as shown previously ( Schultz et al . , 2014 ) . In contrast , CBX treatment significantly reduced the levels of Cdc42 - GTP in Cln3 - / - MBECs ( Figure 5A ; ANOVA , F ( 3 , 16 ) = 9 . 947 , p = 0 . 0006 ) . Correction of Cdc42 - GTP suggested that CBX may mitigate the downstream actin - dependent cell migration and fluid - phase endocytosis defects previously found in Cln3 - / - cells ( Schultz et al . , 2014 ) . To test for correction of cell migration , a scratch wound was made in confluent monolayers of Cln3 R and Cln3 - / - MBECs . Cells were subsequently treated with vehicle or CBX overnight and imaged using live cell microscopy to assess cell migration over time , and the percentage of wound remaining at each time point calculated . As in our former report ( Schultz et al . , 2014 ) , Cln3 R MBECs migrated significantly faster than Cln3 - / - cells at all - time points past 6 hours ( Fig . 5B ) . Importantly , CBX treatment improved Cln3 - / - MBEC migration , such that there was no significant difference between Cln3 R , Cln3 R + CBX or Cln3 - / - + CBX groups ( Fig . 5B , Fig . S2 ) . Thus , CBX is effective at correcting the cell migration defect in Cln3 - / - MBECs . In addition to the role of Cdc42 on cell migration , Cdc42 is a key regulator of fluid - phase endocytosis ( Kumari and Mayor , 2008 ; Schultz et al . , 2014 ) . Impaired fluid phase endocytosis has been reported for Cln3 mutant yeast , Cln3 - / - mouse brain endothelial cells , Cln3 - / - neuronal cells , and in fibroblasts harvested from patients with CLN3 deficiency ( Codlin et al . , 2008 ; Fossale et al . , 2004 ; Luiro et al . , 2004 ; Schultz et al . , 2014 ; Vidal - Donet et al . , 2013 ) . We therefore measured fluid - phase endocytosis by uptake of fluorescently labeled dextran in cells treated with CBX or vehicle . CBX ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT A C C EP T E D M A N U S C R I P T pretreatment of Cln3 - / - MBECs for 30 minutes prior to dextran addition corrected Cln3 - / - fluid - phase endocytic defects ( Fig . 5C ; ( ANOVA , F ( 3 , 8 ) = 10 . 68 , p < 0 . 0036 ) to levels similar to Cln3 R cells . Together these results show that in Cln3 - / - MBECs , CBX improves Cdc42 regulation and the associated actin - dependent functions . To our knowledge , the impact of CBX on Cdc42 activity and Cdc42 - dependent cellular processes has not been previously tested . LINCS compounds correct fluid - phase and caveolar defects in Cln3 - / - MBECs We next employed a transcriptome - based discovery approach to identify drugs that may mimic the effects of CBX ( Fig . 6A ) . We generated gene expression signatures from Cln3 - / - MBEC cells treated with 3 µM CBX vs . vehicle treated cells and normal cells . These signatures were used to mine the NIH Library of Integrated Network - based Cellular Signatures ( LINCS ) ( Lamb et al . , 2006 ) to identify small molecules that induced gene expression profiles similar to that induced by CBX . We also analyzed the effect of enoxolone , a metabolite of CBX ( Iveson et al . , 1971 ) . Of hits , we focused on hydrophobic , neutral molecules that could impact membrane fluidity , and screened these for their ability to correct FITC - dextran uptake . The top six molecules ( Prd , α - KC , K8 , K9 , K4 , and K2 ) significantly increased fluid - phase endocytosis in Cln3 - / - MBEC ( Fig . 6B ; one - way ANOVA , F ( 9 , 128 ) = 15 . 58 , p < 0 . 0001 ) , similar to CBX . For caveolar endocytosis to occur , plasma membrane Cav - 1 is phosphorylated . In Cln3 - / - MBECs , the altered distribution of Cav - 1 at the plasma membrane coincides with a decrease of caveolae number and reduction in phosphorylated Cav - 1 ( P - cav - 1 ) ( Tecedor et al . , 2013 ) . We therefore tested if plasma membrane - resident phospho - cav - ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT A C C EP T E D M A N U S C R I P T 1 was corrected by the LINCS hit compounds . Interestingly , we found that P - cav1 levels significantly recovered after treatment with CBX , its metabolite enoxolone , α - KC , K8 , or K9 ( Fig . 6C ; Mann - Whitney test ) . Treatment with Prd , K4 , or K2 did not reach statistical significance but showed a positive trend ( Fig . 6C ) . In vivo CBX treatment increases BBB responses and reduces autofluorescence Brain endothelial cells are vital for maintaining the integrity of the BBB . Interestingly , injecting hypotonic solutions into blood induces an osmotic gradient across the BBB endothelium ( Tecedor et al . , 2013 ) . In wildtype mice , this osmotic gradient triggers endothelial cell swelling followed by over - shrinkage , allowing small molecule access to the underlying neuropil ( Kozler and Pokorny , 2003 ; Reid and O ' Neil , 2000 ; Tecedor et al . , 2013 ) . The in vivo response to hypotonic shock is defective in Cln3 - / - mice , as demonstrated by impaired passage of small molecule reporters into the brain ( Tecedor et al . , 2013 ) . Here we tested if short - term oral dosing of CBX corrects this defect in aged ( 8 - month old ) Cln3 - null mice . For this , Cln3 - / - and Cln3 + / + mice were gavaged daily with low - dose CBX or vehicle for two weeks , after which they were subjected to hypotonic challenge along with a dye that , unless the vasculature is compromised ( e . g . , by hypotonic challenge ) , remains restricted to the vascular lumen . As before , we used Hoechst dye penetration as a readout for the leakiness of the vasculature ( Tecedor et al . , 2013 ) . For optimal detection of dye leaking into brain parenchyma , our procedure was modified to include sequential delivery of i ) labeled Alexa488 - conjugated wheat germ agglutinin ( WGA ) to label the luminal surfaces of the vasculature , ii ) isotonic ( control ) or hypotonic solution containing ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT A C C EP T E D M A N U S C R I P T Hoechst dye , and iii ) fixative ( Fig . 7A ) . As expected , Cln3 + / + mice treated with isotonic solution do not show extravasation of dye into the brain parenchyma but instead , the dye remains confined to the vessel lumen ( Fig . 7A ) . In vehicle - gavaged mice , hypotonic - induced Hoechst penetration was evident in Cln3 + / + mice , but minimal in Cln3 - / - mice ( Fig . 7B ) , in line with our previous report ( Tecedor et al . , 2013 ) . In contrast , CBX - treated Cln3 - / - mice had substantially increased Hoechst signal in the parenchymal tissue , with the amount of Hoechst dye penetration similar to Cln3 + / + mice treated with CBX ( Fig . 7B ) . These data indicate that CBX normalizes the impaired BBB response of Cln3 - / - mice . In addition to the various BBB defects , JNCL patients and Cln3 mutant mouse models display progressive accumulation of autofluorescence in multiple cell types ( Cotman et al . , 2002 ; Mole et al . , 2005 ; Stein et al . , 2010 ) . Due to the close proximity of the BBB to brain neuropil , we next investigated if CBX alters the accumulation of parenchymal autofluorescence . For this study , aged ( 8 month old ) Cln3 + / + and Cln3 - / - mice were gavaged with CBX or vehicle for two weeks and cortical autofluorescence quantified . As expected , vehicle treated Cln3 - / - mice showed extensive autofluorescence levels compared to wildtype mice . Of note , there was significant reduction of autofluorescence ( Kruskal - Wallis , p = 0 . 0234 ) in CBX - treated Cln3 - / - mice relative to those that received vehicle - treatment ( Fig . 7C ) . Discussion We show that Cln3 - / - mice have increased astrocytic endfeet area ( Fig . 1A ) . Interestingly , enlarged astrocytic endfeet were lacking the notable organelles or ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT A C C EP T E D M A N U S C R I P T membrane inclusions typically seen in these structures . Astrocyte endfeet swelling is an indicator of BBB dysfunction and is commonly found in stroke ( Xiang et al . , 2016 ) . Post stroke , astrocyte endfeet swelling is hypothesized to prevent serum protein entry into the brain ( Xiang et al . , 2016 ) . Enlarged astrocyte endfeet in Cln3 - / - deficient mice may explain the decreased permeability of the Hoechst dye into the brain during hypotonic stress ( Fig . 7 ) . Interestingly , this phenotype improved with CBX treatment ( Fig . 1B ) . Additionally , we found increased GAP junction activity in MBECs which was corrected with CBX ( Fig . 2 ) . Although CBX is a GAP junction inhibitor , our data support that it also modifies lipid microdomains , affecting fluidity and correcting the regulation and function of caveolar and fluid - phase endocytosis ( Figs . 2 - 5 ) . CBX is hypothesized to alter hemi channel opening or synaptic transmission by directly intercalating into the plasma membrane ( Davidson and Baumgarten , 1988 ; Goldberg et al . , 1996 ; Tovar et al . , 2009 ) . This is consistent with previous reports where CBX was shown to have membrane stabilizing effects , which are dependent on lipid concentration ( Symons and Parke , 1980 ) . Interestingly , CBX application to wild type cells had little effect , suggesting that the microdomain modifying effect of CBX may be context dependent . Although we demonstrate an effect on membrane dynamics , the exact mechanism of how CBX modifies lipid microdomains or corrects the in vitro and in vivo phenotypes tested here is not known . CBX can modify lysosomal permeability ( Symons and Parke , 1980 ) , reduce fatty acid induced reactive oxygen species , inhibit sterol regulatory element binding protein - 1c ( Rhee et al . , 2012 ) , alter calcium signaling ( Liu et al . , 2010 ) , inhibit 11 - beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase ( Monder et al . , 1989 ) , and increase heat ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT A C C EP T E D M A N U S C R I P T shock protein expression ( Nagayama et al . , 2001 ) . One could argue that modulation of one or more of these pathways could influence the cellular phenotypes investigated in this study . However , we found that CBX restores most in vitro cell phenotypes quickly ( within one to two hours ) , and speculate that it has a direct influence on cell membranes , creating conformational shifts and altered functions of membrane - associated proteins . We also found other small molecules that behaved similarly to CBX ( Fig . 6 ) . These were identified using an unbiased genomics - based drug - discovery strategy ( NIH Library of Integrated Network - based Cellular Signatures , LINCS ) . Compound screening allowed us to prioritize six small molecules that rescued membrane dynamics to levels comparable to CBX . Interestingly , all six small drugs are uncharged and hydrophobic . These drugs have the potential to intercalate into membranes and produce physicochemical effects on lipid bilayers ( Royer et al 2009 , Ragot et al . 2013 , Heier et al 2013 ) . These drugs were effective at correcting fluid - phase endocytosis and Cav - phosphorylation in Cln3 - / - cells , and support the hypothesis that correcting membrane deficiencies in JNCL may be therapeutically beneficial ( Fig . 6 ) . CXB has a steroid - like structure and a blood half - life of 13 - 26 hours ( Baron et al . , 1978 ; Davidson and Baumgarten , 1988 ; Hayes et al . , 1977 ) . Recently a BBB - permeable derivative of CBX ( Leshchenko et al . , 2006 ) , INI - 0602 , was used to alleviate excessive hemichannel activity associated with Cln3 - / - mouse glial cells , and this drug showed positive effects in Cln3 - / - mouse slice culture models ( Burkovetskaya et al . , 2014 ) . Using a novel BBB permeability assay , we found that CBX treatment restored ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT A C C EP T E D M A N U S C R I P T the BBB response to hypotonic shock . Moreover , two - weeks of CBX treatment resolved autofluorescence in Cln3 - / - mouse brain ( Fig . 7 ) . Rodent gut microflora hydrolyzes CBX into sulfate conjugates of enoxolone ( Iveson et al . , 1971 ) , which enters the blood stream with subsequent presence in the brain and CSF ( Tabuchi et al . , 2012 ) . Interestingly , both CBX , and enoxolone corrected the in vitro phenotypes . As CBX does not cross the BBB ( Leshchenko et al . , 2006 ; Takeuchi et al . , 2011 ) , the metabolite enoxolone may be responsible for the reduced autofluorescent storage either by improving the astrocytic phenotype , the endothelial phenotype , or both . Studies show that amyloid - β accumulation in Alzheimer’s disease brain is due in part to faulty clearance by brain endothelial cells ( Sagare et al . , 2013 ) , and recent work in the JNCL field shows that , in vitro , normalizing astrocytes can improve neuronal phenotypes ( Parviainen et al . , 2017 ) . Regardless of the exact cell type and mechanism of action , CBX and the LINCS compounds provide promising therapeutic avenues for treatment of CLN3 deficiency disease .
