Cortactin binds and activates Arp2 / 3 complex [ 10 , 11 , radius of 59 A˚ ( Table 1 ; also see the Supplementary Material ) , slightly larger than the Stokes radius of 48 A˚ 18 ] . Cortactin also stabilizes Arp2 / 3 - induced branched actin networks and inhibits their disassembly [ 10 ] . In determined by sedimentation velocity .

The large which is involved in Arp2 / 3 binding . Thus , one might expect that cortactin and N - WASp would compete for Stokes radius and high frictional coefficient indicate that the cortactin monomer has an asymmetric shape . binding to Arp2 / 3 complex ; however , this simple view appears to be inconsistent with the apparent synergy “Deep etch” electron microscopy [ 28 , 29 ] of cortactin ( Figure 1 ) showed it to be a slender threadlike molecule , between cortactin and N - WASp VCA with respect to Arp2 / 3 activation . To address this paradox , we have now investigated how cortactin and N - WASp VCA inter - act with Arp2 / 3 complex , using physical and functional assays . The resultsindicatethatcortactin andVCAcom - pete for binding to the Arp3 subunit but may still simulta - neously bind Arp2 / 3 complex because VCA also binds to the Arp2 and ARPC1 / p40 subunits . The N - WASp VCA in this ternary complex is fully functional in its ability to activate Arp2 / 3 complex , and this provides a model for howcortactinandN - WASpinteractwithArp2 / 3complex to promote actin assembly . Results Cortactin Is an Elongated Flexible Monomer To understand how cortactin interacts with Arp2 / 3 com - plex and actin filaments , we first determined the shape and size of cortactin . Previous studies suggested that cortactin may be a multimer [ 11 , 26 ] . We determined the native molecular mass of cortactin by equilibrium sedimentation ( Table 1 ; also see the Supplementary Ma - terial available with this article online ) . A molecular mass of 63 . 5 kDa was calculated from the experimentally de - termined effective reduced molecular weight ( (cid:2) ) and Figure 1 .

Consistent with this result , we have not a three - dimensional masked image ( compare to the adjacent image observed actin filament bundling activity with our prepa - on the right ) .

The fric - experiment ; ( Right two panels ) : Arp2 / 3 molecules alone , without cortactin . tional coefficient for cortactin ( f / f 0 ) is 1 . 8 , consistent with Current Biology 1272 with a width close to the resolution limit of the platinum that was used to replicate the molecules after freeze drying . This platinum forms (cid:1) 20 A˚ beads in such a rep - lica . We alsooccasionally saw larger threadsthat proba - bly represented self - associated or aggregated cortac - tin . When mixed with Arp2 / 3 complex , cortactin was seen as a slender thread attached at one end to Arp2 / 3 complex , aformation thatis consistent withthe previous identification of the Arp2 / 3 binding site near the N termi - nus of cortactin . We were not able to visualize cortactin bound to actin filaments or at filament branch points , probably because cortactin is much thinner than the actin filaments . The average length of optimally repli - cated cortactin molecules was 220 (cid:4) 30 A˚ ( mean (cid:4) SD , n (cid:5) 91 ) , which is slightly shorter than the 290 A˚ length predicted by elliptical modeling of the results of the velocity sedimentation studies ( Table 1 , prolate model ) . Collectively , these hydrodynamic and imaging studies indicatethatcortactinisamonomeric , elongatedprotein with a length of 220 – 290 A˚ . Chemical Crosslinking Studies : How Cortactin and N - WASp Interact with the Subunits of Arp2 / 3 Complex To identify the subunits within Arp2 / 3 complex that may provide binding interfaces with cortactin and VCA , chemical crosslinking studies were performed . Purified Arp2 / 3 complex was incubated with the zero - length crosslinker EDC / NHS in the presence of GST - VCA or the N - terminal Arp2 / 3 binding domain of cortactin ( NTA ) . Crosslinked products were identified by Western blot - ting , by using antibodies specific for individual subunits Figure 2 . Chemical Crosslinking Analysis of Cortactin NTA and of Arp2 / 3 complex . We used a range of protein concen - GST - VCA to Arp2 / 3 Complex trations to define the relative importance and specificity Purified cortactin NTA ( 0 – 5 (cid:6) M ) or GST - VCA ( 0 – 2 . 5 (cid:6) M ) were incu - of the crosslinked products . At protein concentrations bated with Arp2 / 3 complex and crosslinked for 30 min . Western close to the K d for binding to Arp2 / 3 complex [ 11 ] , VCA blots were probed by using antibodies against individual Arp2 / 3 crosslinked to the Arp3 , Arp2 , and ARPC1 / p40 subunits complex subunits as indicated . The uncrosslinked subunits are the ( Figure 2 ) . These subunits have been reported to bind major , lower band in each case . Crosslinked products , if present , are indicated as “xN” ( for NTA ) and “xV” ( for VCA ) . These blots were to the Arp2 / 3 activators Scar and ActA [ 6 ] . At higher purposely overexposed in order to see faint crosslinking bands . concentrations , a faint crosslinking product with n (cid:5) 3 . ARPC2 / p34 was also observed . Cortactin NTA was crosslinked only to the Arp3 sub - unit at low cortactin concentrations ( Figure 2 ) . Faint Cortactin NTA inhibited crosslinking of GST - VCA to the crosslinking products were also observed with the Arp2 , Arp3 subunit but not to Arp2 or ARPC1 / p40 ( Figure 3A ) . ARPC1 / p40 , ARPC2 / p34 , and ARPC3 / p21 subunits ; In the converse experiment , increasing concentrations however , these bands were evident only when the cor - of GST - VCA inhibited crosslinking of cortactin NTA to tactin NTA concentration was at least ten - fold higher Arp3 ( Figure 3B ) . The simplest interpretation of these than that required for crosslinking to Arp3 and above results is that cortactin NTA and N - WASp VCA compete the reported K d for cortactin binding to Arp2 / 3 complex for binding to the Arp3 subunit . An alternative explana - [ 11 , 18 ] . No crosslinking of cortactin or VCA to ARPC5 / tion is that NTA and VCA bind simultaneously and alter p16 or ARPC4 / p20 was observed at any concentration the conformation of Arp2 / 3 complex in such a way as ( data not shown ) . Full - length cortactin and GST - NTA to abrogate the chemical crosslinking reaction . This al - had the same subunit crosslinking pattern as untagged ternative is less likely since crosslinking of VCA or NTA NTA ( data not shown ) . to Arp3 is lost in both converse experiments ; however , we tested the model further with a physical binding experiment that did not involve chemical crosslinking . Cortactin Competes with N - WASp VCA for Binding to Arp3 , but Not to Arp2 or ARPC1 / p40 In this experiment , we used a quantitative GST pull - down assay [ 30 ] to determine the apparent K d for VCA Since both cortactin NTA and N - WASp VCA crosslinked to theArp3subunit , we askedwhether theywouldcompete binding to Arp2 / 3 complex , in the presence or absence of saturating cortactin NTA .

( B ) Competition between VCA and cortactin : pyrene actin polymer - ization assay . A GST fusion of the VCA fragment of N - WASp was incubated with Arp2 / 3 complex in the presence or absence of the Arp2 / 3 binding domain of cortactin ( Cort - NTA ) in polymerization buffer for 10 min at 25 (cid:1) C . Actin polymerization was initiated by the addition of monomeric actin ( 7 . 5 % pyrene labeled ) and was monitored by continuous measurement of fluorescence at 386 nm . Curves had 12 . 5 nM Arp2 / 3 complex (cid:3) 0 . 5 nM GST - VCA with the following additions : ( b ) no additions , ( c ) 2 (cid:6) M GST - NTA , ( d ) 11 (cid:6) M GST - NTA , and ( e ) 22 (cid:6) M GST - NTA . Other controls ( “Controls” ) in - clude actin alone , Arp2 / 3 alone , and Arp2 / 3 (cid:3) 22 (cid:6) M GST - NTA . Activation of Arp2 / 3 complex with higher concentrations of VCA ( “Arp2 / 3 (cid:3) 12 . 5 nM VCA” ) shows that our competition studies were done under conditions in which Arp2 / 3 complex was not saturated by the GST - VCA . n (cid:5) 4 .

Current Biology 1274 tants were analyzed for depletion of Arp2 / 3 complex by Western blotting . From these measurements , we calcu - lated the amount of Arp2 / 3 complex associated with the GST - VCA beads . The concentration of GST - VCA - Arp2 / 3 complex was plotted against the free GST - VCA concen - tration , and apparentK d valueswere determinedbyleast squares analysis ( Figure 3C ) . The apparent K d for VCA binding to Arp2 / 3 complex was 0 . 76 (cid:4) 0 . 01 (cid:6) M and 1 . 21 (cid:4) 0 . 09 (cid:6) M ( mean (cid:4) SE , n (cid:5) 3 ) , in the absence and presence of cortactin NTA , respectively . These values were significantly different ( p (cid:7) 0 . 05 ) . The fact that VCA does bind Arp2 / 3 complex in the presence of a saturat - ing concentration of cortactin provides evidence that a ternary VCA - Arp2 / 3 - cortactin complex can form and is consistent with a model in which cortactin blocks only one of the multiple VCA binding sites within Arp2 / 3 com - plex . Competition at this site is apparently sufficient to decrease the apparent binding constant for the VCA - Arp2 / 3 interaction . When the converse pull - down experiment was per - formed withGST - NTA beads , asaturating concentration of VCA ( 14 (cid:6) M ) completely blocked Arp2 / 3 binding to the beads ( see the Supplementary Material ) . Therefore , physical binding studies also support a model in which cortactin NTA and N - WASp VCA compete for a single binding site , i . e . , Arp3 , within Arp2 / 3 complex , and N - WASp VCA has additional binding sites . Cortactin Does Not Inhibit Activation of Arp2 / 3 Complex by N - WASp VCA To test for functional competition between cortactin and N - WASp VCA , we asked whether cortactin NTA inhibits the ability of VCA to activate Arp2 / 3 complex . Cortactin NTA alone , without the F - actin binding domain , binds but does not activate Arp2 / 3 complex [ 10 , 18 ] . We de - signedpyrene actinpolymerization assayswith asubsa - turating concentration of VCA ( 0 . 5 nM ) and a low con - centration of Arp2 / 3 complex ( 12 . 5 nM ) , to which we added excess NTA . Concentrations of NTA up to 22 (cid:6) M did not affect activation of Arp2 / 3 complex by VCA ( Fig - ure 4 ) . Experiments with both tagged and untagged pro - teins ( VCA with GST - NTA , GST - VCA with NTA , GST - VCA with GST - NTA ) yielded similar results ( data not shown ) . We calculated that virtually all of the Arp2 / 3 complex should have been bound to NTA ( calculated for 22 (cid:6) M NTA ) , assuming equilibrium conditions and conserva - tion of mass and using previously determined K d s of 1 . 0 – 1 . 3 (cid:6) M and 0 . 2 – 0 . 75 (cid:6) M for the binding of cortactin and VCA , respectively , to Arp2 / 3 complex [ 11 , 18 ] , ( Fig - ure 3C ) .

The black solid bars represent wild - type GST - VCA , tometry of films from the subunit - specific Western blots , such as the diagonally hatched bars represent GST - W503A , and the gray the ones shown in ( C ) . The data are plotted as the percentage of solid bars represent GST - (cid:8) 498 – 505 . Cortactin , N - WASp , and Arp2 / 3 Complex 1275 subunit may not be necessary for VCA activation of Arp2 / 3 complex . To test this hypothesis , we mutated the DDW binding motif that is shared with cortactin ( Figure 5A ) . We truncated the C terminus by eight amino acids ( (cid:8) 498 – 505 ) , thusdeletingtheDDWmotif . Inpyrene actin polymerization assays , (cid:8) 498 – 505 VCA activated Arp2 / 3 complex as well as did wild - type VCA ( Figure 5B ) . This experiment was performed with GST fusions of VCA ; untagged versions also showed no difference between wild - type and mutant VCAs ( data not shown ) . To test for interaction of the mutant VCA with the Arp3 subunit , chemical crosslinking was performed . Cross - linking of the (cid:8) 498 – 505 VCA to Arp3 was decreased by 81 (cid:4) 7 % relative to wild - type VCA . Crosslinking to ARPC1 / p40 was decreased by 37 (cid:4) 7 % , and crosslink - ing to Arp2 was not changed ( representative blot shown in Figure 5C , quantitation by densitometry of films from three separate experiments graphed in Figure 5D ) . A VCA mutant in which the conserved tryptophan in the DDW motif was changed to an alanine ( W503A ) had unchanged crosslinking to Arp3 , Arp2 , or ARPC1 / p40 and unchanged activity ( Figure 5 ) . It is possible that the removal of acidic residues from (cid:8) 498 – 505 VCA affected the crosslinking of VCA to Arp3 without fully abolishing the bindingof VCA toArp3 . However , thesedata support the prediction that the shared DDW motif in VCA and cortactinisinvolvedinArp3bindingandthatthisinterac - tion is not necessary for activation of Arp2 / 3 complex Figure 6 .

Model for Binding of Cortactin and N - WASp VCA to Arp2 / 3 Complex interaction of N - WASp VCA with the Arp3 subunit , but not with the Arp2 or ARPC1 / p40 subunits . In a physical Cortactin and N - WASp share a common acidic domain that binds Arp2 / 3 complex , but they are able to cooper - binding ( pull - down ) experiment , cortactin caused a modest decrease in the apparent affinity of VCA for ate and even synergize in activating Arp2 / 3 complex [ 10 , 11 ] . Our results here provide an explanation for Arp2 / 3 complex , but did not prevent the interaction . By contrast , N - WASp VCA completely blocked both the this apparent paradox by demonstrating that a ternary complex between cortactin , Arp2 / 3 complex , and binding of cortactin to Arp2 / 3 complex in a pull - down assay and the chemical crosslinking of cortactin to the N - WASp VCAcan form . Cortactin andN - WASp compete for binding to one subunit , the Arp3 subunit , of Arp2 / 3 Arp3 subunit . The interaction of N - WASp VCA with the Arp3 subunit , complex . N - WASp has additional interactions with the Arp2 and ARPC1 / p40 subunits , which are not found with which is competed by cortactin , appears to play little or no role in the activation of Arp2 / 3 complex . An cortactin and are not competed by cortactin ( see model in Figure 7 ) . N - WASp VCA truncation mutant , lacking the DDW motif , no longer can be crosslinked to Arp3 but activates These conclusions are based on several results . In a chemical crosslinking experiment , cortactin blocked the Arp2 / 3 complex normally . Also , high concentrations of Current Biology 1276 Figure 7 .

Cortactin is also shown binding ac - tin filaments via its central repeats domain and a third molecule ( “X” ) , such as dynamin or SHANK , via its SH3 domain . Cortactin is drawn here as binding the mother filament , but it may bind the daughter filament instead . cortactin NTA compete away the VCA - Arp3 interaction F - actin , may cause Arp2 / 3 complex to assume the same or different conformational states . In other words , the but have no effect on the activation of Arp2 / 3 complex by VCA . Therefore , the interactions of N - WASp VCA with conformational pathway followed by Arp2 / 3 complex may differ depending on its interactions with N - WASp , other subunits , namely , Arp2 and ARPC1 / p40 , may be more important for activation . cortactin , actin monomers , and actin filaments .

Electron micrographs reveal that actin filament , and N - WASp induces strong activation one end of cortactin binds Arp2 / 3 complex , and this is of Arp2 / 3 complex to nucleate the formation of the consistent with previous studies localizing the Arp2 / 3 daughter filament . The interaction of cortactin with binding domain to the N - terminal portion of cortactin Arp2 / 3 complex can be abolished by excess N - WASp [ 18 ] . Together , all our findings are consistent with the VCA , so whether a ternary complex forms in vivo will idea that cortactin can bind simultaneously to three pro - depend on the microenvironment , including the local teins — Arp2 / 3 complex at its N terminus , an actin fila - concentrations of cortactin and activated N - WASp . ment in its central region , and a third molecule , such N - WASp and cortactin were coimmunoprecipitated as dynamin , Shank , CortBP , or ZO - 1 [ 17 ] , via the SH3 from lysates of src - transformed fibroblasts [ 23 ] , consis - domain near its C terminus .
