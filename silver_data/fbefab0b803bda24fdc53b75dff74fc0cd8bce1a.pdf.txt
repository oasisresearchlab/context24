Key Words COVID - 19 transmission , prevention , children , household transmission J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Abstract / Summary : Limiting exposure to SARS - CoV - 2 virus has been the major principle guiding public health measures . Masking , social distancing as well as frequent hand hygiene have been the chief non - pharmaceutical interventions as preventive strategies for all age groups . Advancement in vaccine development and vaccination of large populations offer a glimmer of hope for containing and ending this pandemic . However , until immunization is widespread in the community masking , social distancing , and frequent handwashing as well as early detection and isolation of infected persons should be continued to curb the spread of illness . Key points :  Infections due to SARS - CoV - 2 virus are spread mainly person - to - person transmission via respiratory droplets .  Household transmission has been well documented and spread from presymptomatic and symptomatic individuals is a key driver for transmission .  SARS - CoV - 2 related illness have usually been mild in children with rare complications leading to mortality .  Various investigations and published experiences have shown that schools and daycares have been safely opened with implementation of guidance of mask wearing , maintaining distance and hand hygiene .  Vaccination against SARS - CoV - 2 offer a way to reduce rates of severe illness and mortality from the disease . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Avoidance of COVID - 19 for Children and Adolescents and Isolation Precautions Introduction “ Prevention is better than cure ” has been the dictum driving the public health response to the novel coronavirus which was first reported in China towards the end of 2019 . 1 Full - length genomic sequencing from virus identified from infected patients were 96 % identical to a bat coronavirus . The novel coronavirus shared 79 . 6 % sequence identity with the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ( SARS ) coronavirus and , therefore , was named SARS - CoV - 2 . 2 The virus has since spread worldwide and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) on March 11 , 2020 . 3 , 4 Initial emphasis had been on containment measures to curb community spread with widespread lockdowns , school closures and non - pharmaceutical interventions like masking and social distancing . There have been multiple reports of familial clusters and studies on household transmission . 5 - 14 However , there is limited guidance on prevention measures once a household member is diagnosed or exposed to the virus . This review highlights available data on transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 and reviews preventive measures to reduce transmission of the virus both in the community and household setting . Epidemiology Transmission and incubation period The acquisition of SARS - CoV - 2 occurs when susceptible host comes in contact with respiratory secretions from an infected individual . Most transmission occurs through large droplets and occasionally small droplets via airborne spread . 15 - 18 Airborne transmission can occur in enclosed spaces , poorly ventilated areas with improper air handling and prolonged or higher exposure dose of respiratory J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f particles as with expiratory exertion during exercise or singing . 19 - 22 Theoretically , transmission can occur through contaminated surfaces , however , this is infrequent . Virus has been detected in stool specimens , however , viable virus has not been isolated from stool samples . 23 The incubation period for SARS - CoV - 2 is up to 14 days from the time of exposure and about 50 % of exposed have symptoms by day 4 or 5 and 98 % by day 12 from exposure . 24 - 29 The window of contagiousness for a symptomatic individual starts about 2 - 3 days prior to onset of symptoms and peaks at symptoms onset and decline over the following 7 days for the majority of cases . 30 - 33 Therefore , presymptomatic transmission appears to be a significant driver of spread of infection in the community and households . Early on during the pandemic asymptomatic carriers were thought to be significant spreaders especially in the household setting . 34 , 35 However , recent data from Wuhan , China showed that there was no SARS - CoV - 2 virus detected by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) in 1 , 174 close household contacts of the 300 asymptomatic cases . 36 The role of asymptomatic spreaders remains controversial with recent modeling data suggesting that 50 % of new infections were estimated to have been acquired from asymptomatic spreaders . 37 The period of contagiousness for asymptomatic individuals is not clearly understood and for purposes of contact tracing the cut - off of 48 hours prior to the positive test date is applied for identification of individuals who had potential exposure . Secondary attack rates and Household transmission Secondary attack rate ( SAR ) is defined as the proportion of infections that occur among susceptible individuals following contact with an infected case within the incubation period . 38 The SAR for SARS - CoV - 2 varies in different contact and exposure settings . Recent meta - analysis showed a pooled SAR for SARS - CoV - 2 in diverse contact settings of 7 % ( 95 % CI : 3 % - 12 % ) . 39 This study also highlighted low SAR in healthcare facilities , public transport and work settings as compared to the high SAR in households and exposures in social gatherings . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Crowded indoor environments and close contact among household members is a high risk setting for transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 . Initial reports out of China described SAR of 12 . 4 % among household contacts when defined on the basis of close relatives and 17 . 1 % when they shared the same residential address . 8 Recent systemic review and meta - analysis estimated household SAR of 16 . 6 % ( 95 % CI 14 . 0 % - 19 . 3 % ) . 40 Most published literature reports increased SAR from symptomatic index cases as compared to asymptomatic index cases as well as in spouses as compared to other family contacts . 40 , 41 Lewis et al . reported that 31 out of the 58 households from Utah and Wisconsin had secondary transmission and 52 of 188 household contacts tested positive by either PCR - assay or serologic testing giving a secondary infection rate of 28 % . 9 This study was done during March - April 2020 when there was relatively low community prevalence at the study sites to reduce risk of additional community exposure . Higher secondary infection rate of 53 % ( 95 % CI : 46 % - 60 % ) were detected in households in a study done in Tennessee and Wisconsin thru April - September 2020 . 6 Various retrospective studies have identified black ethnicity , male gender , smoking and obesity as risk factors associated with higher risk of infections . 42 - 44 Higher rates of infection have been reported in older household contacts ( age ≥ 60 ) as compared to younger contacts . 5 , 8 Multiple reports described lower SAR for children as compared to adults . 5 , 8 - 10 , 40 , 41 Hu et al . performed retrospective review of secondary cases and reported that secondary cases had less severe symptoms like fever , cough , sore throat and myalgia as compared to the index cases . 45 Transmission from children : Prolonged shedding of respiratory viruses after viral illness has been described in children younger than 5 years when compared with older participants . 46 With most children having none to mild symptoms it was thought that children could serve as a silent reservoir for SARS - CoV - 2 . However , multiple studies of outbreaks in familial clusters have shown that children are rarely the index case and are often identified J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f after an adult has tested positive . Similar findings were confirmed from outbreaks at childcare facilities which was linked to index cases in adults . 47 In a large multicenter cross - sectional investigation in Germany the estimated SARS - CoV - 2 seroprevalence was low in parents and 3 - fold lower in children . 48 Follow up interviews with families of children who were hospitalized for COVID - 19 illness were performed 6 weeks after the child became ill showed there were no reported illness in the household and one case of child - to - child transmission . 49 School and daycare attendance : Schools across the United States were preemptively closed to in - person classes and transitioned to virtual learning early on during the pandemic to mitigate spread of SARS - CoV - 2 . However , as months passed certain states allowed in - person learning options along with the remote option . With the help of the local health department and guidance from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) there have been multiple reports published for safe reopening of schools . A recent study from Mississippi showed that attending school or childcare 2 weeks prior to testing date was not associated with an increased probability of a positive SARS - CoV - 2 test . 47 Parents of cases and controls reported 64 % and 76 % consistent mask use respectively for both children and staff at school or childcare facility . Most of the children ( < 18 years ) who tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 were more likely to have attended gatherings with people outside their household 14 days prior to testing positive . Similar results were reported from North Carolina schools over a period of 9 weeks with extensive contact tracing where there was limited secondary transmission and zero child - to - adult transmission noted within the school . 50 These studies highlight that in - person teaching at schools can be achieved with consistent mask wearing , hand hygiene and maintaining a distance of 6 feet as well as screening and early detection of infection . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Non - pharmaceutical interventions for prevention of SARS - CoV - 2 : Non - pharmaceutical interventions recommended to reduce transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 include mask wearing , social distancing , hand hygiene , disinfection of frequently touched surfaces , improved ventilation , self - isolation , and quarantine . Mask wearing Face masks are thought to reduce viral transmission from both the source and target of infection ; they reduce the exhalation of respiratory particles by an infected person 51 , 52 and reduce the inhalation of these particles by a susceptible host 52 , 53 . Evidence supporting facemask use comes from epidemiological data , observational studies , mathematical models , and laboratory studies . Like SARS and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome ( MERS ) Coronavirus , SARS - CoV - 2 is a member of the Betacoronavirus genus , but it resembles the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus in its high degree of upper respiratory tract shedding , its propensity for asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission and the scope of its global spread . 54 The WHO sponsored a systematic review and meta - analysis that concluded that facemask use could significantly decrease the risk of SARS - CoV - 2 infection . 55 In their systematic review and meta - analysis , Li et al . found that mask wearing significantly reduced the risk of COVID - 19 infection , with a pooled OR of 0 . 38 and 95 % CI : 0 . 21 - 0 . 69 . 56 A retrospective cohort study of households in Beijing , China , showed a 79 % reduction in transmission if both the index case and family contacts wore masks before onset of symptoms in the index case . 57 Epidemiological studies support the widespread use of face masks to prevent community transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 . Early in the course of the pandemic , Cheng et al . compared the epidemiology of SARS - CoV - 2 in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region ( HKSAR ) , where community - wide compliance J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f with face mask use was 96 . 6 % , with selected countries in North America , Europe , and Asia having similar population density , but without universal masking . They found that the incidence of SARS - CoV - 2 was significantly lower in HSKAR . 58 A cross - sectional population level study in the United States showed that self - reported face mask use was correlated with increased odds of transmission control , and that the effect of mask use was higher with increased levels of physical distancing . 59 Laboratory studies of airborne transmission provide additional evidence for the role of mask wearing in preventing the spread of COVID - 19 . Ueki et al . examined the efficacy of cotton , surgical , and N95 of masks in blocking the transmission of infectious droplets and aerosols of SARS - CoV - 2 using an airborne transmission simulator . They found that all types of masks were protective against transmission of infectious particles , with a stronger effect noted when the mask was worn by the source of the virus . 52 A study of the aerosol filtration efficiency of cloth masks showed that snugly fitted masks could provide good protection from a range of aerosol particle sizes . Filtration efficiency was significantly higher in masks made from multiple layers of tightly woven fabric , particularly when different types of fabric were combined in the same mask . Of note , filtration efficiency in poorly fitted masks was found to decrease by more than 60 % , highlighting the importance of proper mask fitting to reduce transmission of respiratory particles . 53 Current evidence - based guidelines from the CDC emphasize the importance of consistent and correct face mask use to decrease transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 virus in the community . The CDC recommends using fabric masks made with two or three layers of tightly woven , breathable fabric ( such as cotton ) , or disposable , single - use non - medical masks . Regardless of the type of mask used , it should be snugly fitted around the nose and chin , without large gaps at the sides or top . Masks with exhalation valves or vents should not be used , as they may allow passage of respiratory particles . In order to prevent critical supply shortages , surgical masks and respirators should be avoided in the community setting . Outside J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f the home , face masks should be while indoors in public places , and in crowded outdoor areas where interpersonal distance is less than 6 feet . 60 Physical distancing Studies of COVID - 19 outbreaks occurring in community settings outside the home have shown that increased infection risk is associated with close contact with other members of the community , particularly in enclosed spaces . 60 A contact tracing study of train passengers in China found that risk of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission increased with spatial proximity to the index case , as well as increased duration of shared travel time . 61 Epidemiological studies lend support to public health guidance on physical distancing to slow the spread of the pandemic . The WHO ’s systematic review and meta - analysis of non - pharmaceutical measures to prevent SARS - CoV - 2 transmission found that the risk of viral infection decreased as interpersonal distancing increased , and concluded that physical separation of at least 1 meter was beneficial , but separation of 2 meters might be more effective in decreasing the risk of infection . 55 The COVID - 19 Pandemic Pulse Study evaluated self - reported movement patterns and non - pharmaceutical intervention use with SARS - CoV - 2 positivity in Maryland in June of 2020 . While this study failed to show a statistically significant effect for indoor mask use , it did demonstrate a significant association between strict social distancing and decreased risk of SARS - CoV - 2 infection . Of note , after adjusting for social distancing and demographic variables , the types of movement significantly correlated with increased infection risk were use of public transportation and visiting a place of worship within the previous 2 weeks . 62 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Physical distancing to reduce the spread of SARS - CoV - 2 has reduced the incidence of other respiratory viruses . A Mayo Clinic study that reviewed community transmission of respiratory viruses in Arizona found that enactment of distancing policies coincided with a marked reduction in the both the overall number of respiratory panel tests and the percentage of positive test results for common respiratory viruses during April through July of 2020 , compared to the equivalent time frame in 2017 through 2019 . 63 Based on the available evidence regarding transmission patterns , unnecessary interactions with persons outside one’s household should be limited while SARS - CoV - 2 is circulating in the community . 60 When outside the home , physical distance of ≥6 feet should be maintained from non - household members . Unnecessary exposure to indoor environments should be avoided , particularly those associated with increased transmission risk , such as indoor restaurant dining , worship services , and exercise classes . Non - essential use of public transportation should be avoided whenever possible . Since there is emerging evidence of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission occurring in large outdoor gatherings , exposure to crowded outdoor venues should also be avoided . 60 , 64 Limiting contact with other members of the community is especially important for persons at high risk for severe COVID - 19 illness , and those who share a household with someone at high risk . With the advent of widespread immunization for COVID - 19 , the CDC has issued revised guidelines for indoor visits or small gatherings in private residences . Fully vaccinated people do not need to wear masks or maintain physical distancing during indoor visits with other fully vaccinated people , or with unvaccinated people from a single household who are at low risk for severe COVID - 19 disease . If any of the unvaccinated people or their household members are at increased risk of severe COVID - 19 disease , or if the unvaccinated people come from multiple households , fully vaccinated people should continue to wear masks , maintain physical distance of at least 6 feet , and visit outdoors or in a well - ventilated indoor space . 65 Unvaccinated individuals should continue to limit the number of unvaccinated visitors allowed inside the home , ensure that masks are J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f worn by unvaccinated visitors and members of the household alike , maintain at least 6 feet of separation from unvaccinated visitors at all times , and limit the amount of time spent visiting indoors . 66 All people , regardless of their immunization status , should continue to avoid medium or large sized gatherings , regardless of their immunization status . 65 The CDC recommends that people postpone travel while SARS - CoV - 2 is prevalent in the community . Those who do travel should be tested for SARS - CoV - 2 1 to 3 days before departure and retested 3 to 5 days after arrival . Upon return , travelers should self - isolate and monitor for symptoms at home for 7 days if tested , even if test results are negative , and for 10 days if not tested . If other members of the household did not accompany the traveler , both the traveler and other members of the household should wear masks in shared household spaces for 14 days . 67 Hand Hygiene While there are several case reports of suspected transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 via contact with contaminated surfaces , there is currently no definitive evidence of transmission via direct contact or fomites . 68 Studies of non - pharmaceutical interventions to prevent the spread of respiratory viruses have shown mixed results on the efficacy of hand washing alone . A systematic review and meta - analysis of influenza virus transmission in the community found that frequent hand hygiene plus mask wearing significantly decreased transmission of influenza , but hand hygiene alone did not . 69 It should be noted , however , that these reviews considered the impact of hand hygiene on transmission of respiratory J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f viruses but not SARS - CoV - 2 . These results may not correspond to the real - world transmission dynamics of SARS - CoV - 2 , which is significantly more stable than influenza virus . 70 A modeling study by Przekwas et al . described how the SARS - CoV - 2 virus might be inoculated onto respiratory epithelium via deposition of viral particles on the face by contaminated hands , and concluded that washing of the face and hands might prevent infection . 71 Since SARS - CoV - 2 is a lipid - enveloped RNA virus , it is susceptible to inactivation by agents which disrupt the integrity of its lipid envelope , such as alcohol and hand soap . 72 A review of commonly used hand sanitizers found that most alcohol - based hand sanitizers were successful at inactivating enveloped viruses , including coronavirus , but that washing with soap and water was superior to sanitizers in removing pathogens and debris from hands . 73 A laboratory study by Hirose , et al . which determined that hand sanitizer containing 80 % ethanol completely inactivated SARS - CoV - 2 on skin within 15 seconds of exposure . 70 Disinfection of frequently touched surfaces Although less likely , transmission by fomites remains a possibility , and disinfection of frequently touched surfaces may help to decrease the risk of infection . A retrospective cohort study of households in Beijing , China , found that daily use of a disinfectant containing chlorine or ethanol was 77 % effective in decreasing household transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 . 57 A literature review examined the effectiveness of various cleaning products in disinfecting surfaces contaminated by human coronaviruses concluded that the virus was successfully inactivated by J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f solutions of 62 - 71 % ethanol , 0 . 5 % hydrogen peroxide , or 0 . 1 % sodium hypochlorite within 1 minute . For household disinfection , the authors recommend a 1 : 50 dilution of standard household bleach ; alternatively , a solution of 62 - 70 % ethanol may be used for disinfection of small surfaces . 74 Current guidance for prevention of COVID - 19 from WHO recommends the use of 0 . 1 % sodium hypochlorite solution or 70 % - 90 % ethanol for household disinfection . 75 Ventilation Respiratory particles emitted by humans span a continuum of sizes , from large droplets to tiny aerosols . Conventi onal wisdom holds that droplets > 5 μm in diameter fall to the ground within 1 - 2 meters of the source , while smaller aerosols remain suspended in the air ; however , this is now understood to be a false dichotomy . The duration of time that a particle remains suspended in the air depends not only on its diameter , but also on the velocity at which it is emitted , and a host of environmental factors , including the temperature , humidity , speed , and direction of ambient airflow . 76 It is not surprising , therefore , that both proximity and ventilation have emerged as key determinants of transmission risk for SARS - CoV - 2 . 68 A mathematical model of indoor transmission found that increasing ventilation rate was correlated with decreasing infection probability . Of note , the model also predicted that mask wearing indoors significantly decreased infection probability , even at lower rates of air exchange . 77 Using the principles of fluid mechanics , Bhagat et al . assessed the impact of ventilation on the movement of infectious particles in an enclosed space , and concluded that displacement ventilation was most effective in removing contaminated air and decreasing the exposure risk . Displacement ventilation consists of exhaust fans or vents installed on or near the ceiling of the room , 78 and can be found in the kitchens and bathrooms of most modern homes . Preventive measures when household member has been diagnosed with COVID and is at home J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Given the high secondary attack rate of SARS - CoV - 2 in households , special care must be taken to reduce the risk of transmission to household contacts when an infected person is quarantined at home . The CDC provides detailed recommendations for preventive measures when a member of the household is symptomatic with COVID - 19 and is cared for at home . The same recommendations apply when a household member has tested positive for the virus but remains asymptomatic or presymptomatic . The affected person should be isolated from other members of the household , and if possible , should use a separate bedroom and bathroom , and eat meals in their room . Caregivers should limit exposure to the individual and try to maintain at least 6 feet of interpersonal distance . The affected person and their household contacts should wear masks whenever they are near each other ; however , masks should not be worn by children under age 2 , people who are unable to remove them without assistance , or anyone with respiratory distress . 79 Prevention of airborne transmission is particularly important in household settings . Current CDC guidance emphasizes the importance of good ventilation to decrease the concentration of potentially infectious airborne particles in shared indoor spaces . Recommendations for improving household ventilation include the following : 80  Open doors and windows as much as possible to introduce fresh air from outside .  Increase air circulation in the home using portable fans , ceiling fans , or central HVAC fan setting .  Install high - efficiency pleated filters in central heating , ventilation , and air conditioning systems . Filter indoor air using a portable air cleaner or HEPA filter .  Turn on exhaust fans in kitchen and bathroom , or place portable fans blowing outward near open doors and windows , to move stale air outdoors . To decrease transmission through direct contact and fomites , the CDC advises that household members wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds , or use hand sanitizer J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f containing at least 60 % alcohol , and avoid touching their eyes , nose or mouth with unwashed hands . Frequently touched surfaces , such as light switches , doorknobs , desks , tables , electronics , sinks , faucets , and toilets should be cleaned and disinfected daily . If the affected person uses a shared bathroom , they should clean and disinfect it after use if they are able to do so ; if not , the caregiver should wait as long as possible before entering the bathroom to clean and disinfect it . Caregivers should wear gloves to prevent contact with the affected person’s secretions , bodily fluids , or stool . Gloves should also be worn when handling contaminated items , washing dishes , or doing laundry . Dishes should be washed with soap and hot water , or in a dishwasher . Dirty laundry may be combined with laundry from other household members but should washed and dried on the hottest settings possible . Used gloves , masks , and other contaminated items should be discarded in a trash can with a disposable liner , preferably one set aside for use by the affected person , and gloves should be worn when handling and disposing of contaminated trash . Caregivers should wash their hands after removing gloves . 79 Since the estimated incubation period of SARS - CoV - 2 can last up to 14 days , the CDC recommends that caregivers and close household contacts of the affected person quarantine at home for 14 days after their last exposure to the affected person , or 14 days after the affected person meets criteria to end isolation . “Close contact” is defined as being within 6 feet of the infected person for a total of 15 minutes or more , direct physical contact such as hugging or kissing , sharing the same utensils for eating or drinking , or direct exposure to respiratory droplets from coughing or sneezing . Caregivers and close household contacts with a history of laboratory - confirmed COVID - 19 infection and recovery within the past 3 months or fully vaccinated contacts are exempted from the quarantine requirement , and do not require repeat testing unless they become symptomatic . 81 Public health departments establish quarantine guidelines within their jurisdictions based on local circumstances and resources , and may recommend alternative guidelines to shorten the duration of quarantine . 81 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f P harmaceutical interventions Throughout the pandemic , there have been ongoing efforts to evaluate antiviral properties of medications that could prevent SARS - CoV - 2 infection following exposure . Examples include anti - parasitic drugs such as ivermectin , antimalarials such as hydroxychloroquine , antiviral medications such as amantadine and antiretroviral medications . 82 None of the therapeutics have shown a clear benefit and have not been approved / recommended for early prevention of COVID - 19 infection . Additionally , there are various ongoing clinical studies to also understand the role of early therapeutic interventions to prevent progression of disease in early phase of illness . Anti - SARS - CoV - 2 monoclonal antibodies such as bamlanivimab and the combination of casirivimab and imdevimab received an emergency use authorization ( EUA ) by the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) as preventive management for non - hospitalized patients at high risk of disease progression who have mild to moderate illness . The interim results of a phase 2 , randomized , placebo - controlled trial showed that single infusion of bamlanivimab increased the viral RNA clearance and decreased rates of hospitalization as compared to placebo group . 83 . The current EUAs for both bamlanivimab and the combination of casirivimab and imdevimab include pediatric patients at least twelve years of age who weigh at least 40 kg . Vitamin D and vitamin C have been studied as potential immunomodulatory agents to prevent infection with SARS - CoV - 2 . However , data on prevention of COVID - 19 with supplements containing vitamin D and vitamin C are limited to observational studies . Vitamin D increases innate immunity by secretion of antiviral peptides which improve mucosal defenses . Various systematic reviews and meta - analyses of observational data have shown that low levels of serum vitamin D are associated with increase in respiratory tract infections , including influenza and pneumonia . A recent study evaluating the association between average levels of vitamin D and mortality caused by COVID - 19 and number of cases J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f of COVID - 19 . This study was limited to European countries and found a negative correlation between levels of vitamin D and number of cases of COVID - 19 as well as mortality caused by COVID - 19 , showing that low vitamin D level may be associated with COVID - 19 infection and complications . 84 Another study of patients in European countries found a significant negative correlation between average vitamin D levels and COVID - 19 cases , but not with death . 85 Due to the limited generalizability of these trials and lack of studies in pediatric patients , supplementation with vitamin D to prevent SARS - CoV - 2 infection is currently not recommended . However , vitamin D supplementation may be warranted in pediatric patients with known vitamin D deficiency . Ascorbic acid , or Vitamin C have been studied as potential immunomodulatory . Vitamin C has been evaluated in patient with serious infections and sepsis with inconsistent results . 86 , 87 While there are many ongoing clinical trials evaluating its place in therapy , it is currently not routinely recommended for prevention of SARS - CoV - 2 in pediatric patients . Zinc supplementation has also been studied as a preventive as well as management of COVID - 19 in ongoing clinical trials . In vitro studies have shown that increased intracellular Zinc concentrations decrease replication in RNA viruses such as rhinoviruses and coronaviruses . 88 , 89 Topical The nose and mouth are significant entry portals for the virus , since infection is primarily transmitted by inhalation of or contact with infected droplets . Additionally , the nasal cavity and nasopharynx contains the highest viral load . Therefore , topical nasal irrigations and oral rinses have been identified as potential options to prevent SARS - CoV - 2 infection . There is currently limited evidence regarding the use of topical therapies in the prevention of SARS - CoV - 2 infection specifically . However , available data to support these agents in other viral illnesses may help guide preventive measures for SARS - CoV - 2 . 90 Regular use of saline nasal irrigation in children has been J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f shown to prevent symptoms of rhinitis and associated complications . 91 Additionally , use of hypertonic saline nasal irrigation and gargling was associated with decreased duration of illness , over - the - counter medication use , transmission within household contacts , and viral load of many viruses , including rhinovirus , enterovirus , influenza A virus , and coronavirus ( not SARS - CoV - 2 ) . 92 Povidone - iodine ( PVP - 1 ) is another topical agent identified for potential use in the prevention of SARS - CoV - 2 infections . PVP - 1 is a solution that disrupts microbial metabolic pathways , destabilizes structural components of cell membranes , and leads to irreversible damage to pathogen . PVP - 1 has been shown to achieve almost 100 % virucidal activity against SARS - CoV - 2 within 30 seconds of contact in the laboratory . 93 Another in vitro study found the PVP - 1 at diluted concentrations of 0 . 5 % , 1 . 25 % , and 2 . 5 % completely inactivated SARS - CoV - 2 within 15 seconds of contact . 94 While neither of these studies were done in humans , a review of PVP - 1 use in sinonasal and oral cavities found that PVP - 1 is safe to use in the nose up to a strength of 1 . 25 % for 5 months and in the mouth up to a strength of 5 % for 6 months . 95 However , the over - the - counter product is commercially available at a strength of 10 % , so this product should not be used in the nose or mouth . Until a commercially available diluted solution is available and clinical trials have been completed , PVP - 1 should not be used to prevent SARS - CoV - 2 infections in children . There is currently insufficient evidence to support use of topical therapies to prevent COVID - 19 in children . Risks associated with these therapies include irritation , loss of smell , and destruction of micro - organisms in the nose or mouth that are useful in preventing infection . Additionally , if nasal spray solutions are used on multiple children without sterilizing the bottle or product , spread of disease may increase . There are currently multiple trials underway to determine the safety and efficacy of topical agents in prevention of COVID - 19 infection and transmission . Vaccines J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Vaccines offer the best preventive strategy to contain the SARS - CoV - 2 pandemic . Several vaccines using different methodology are being developed across the world . Recently , two nucleoside - modified RNA vaccine encoding SARS - CoV - 2 spike protein were shown efficacious in preventing COVID - 19 illness , including severe disease . 96 , 97 These two vaccines received an emergency use authorization ( EUA ) by the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) and are being used across the United States to vaccinate healthcare workers and people at high risk of severe disease . The Pfizer - BioNTech COVID - 19 vaccine and MODERNA COVID - 19 vaccine also received an interim recommendation for immunization of individuals ≥ 16 years of age and ≥ 18 years respectively . 98 , 99 However , there are clinical trials being done to evaluate safety and efficacy in younger children . There is limited data on the effect of vaccine on asymptomatic transmission and therefore the current recommendation is to continue practicing masking and social distancing until a majority of the population is immunized . Summary : Prevention of exposure to SARS - CoV - 2 and most recently vaccination against the virus have been the mainstay to spread of the virus . Children have been reported to have mild illness with few developing complications and having poor outcomes . Children have also been not noted to spread or acquire the virus as much as the adults . Childcare settings and schools have been safely reopened with minimal transmission noted among children with safety measures of masking , maintaining distance and hand washing . Transmission in the outdoor settings is low and indoor transmission can be reduced in the household setting by increasing ventilation along with other mitigation strategies . Pharmaceutical interventions other than vaccination have not been shown to prevent infection with SARs - CoV - 2 virus . Clinics care points : J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f • Non - pharmaceutical interventions like social - distancing , masking and hand - hygiene have been the primary preventive strategies to avoid infection with SARS - CoV - 2 virus . • Early and rapid identification of infected individuals and tracing of contacts as well as isolation and quarantine are effective measures to curb the spread of infection . • Systematic development of effective vaccines to prevent severe illness due to COVID - 19 offer a path forward to containing the pandemic and reducing the burden of severe disease Othe r pharmaceutical interventions are still under investigation and so far have not shown benefit in preventing COVID - 19 .
