However , two related but distinct explanations exist as to the source of such a discount . One explanation suggests that “actual” skills are degraded when producers attempt to engage across diverse categories . Another explanation involves perceptual ﬁt to category representations held by an audience as the cause . These two explanations tend to be confounded in archival studies because external observers , responsible for the evaluation of market performance , are often aware of both the identity of producers and the underlying characteristics of their products . This leaves researchers unable to empirically separate effects . We present an analysis conducted in a setting in which it was possible to distinguish the two mechanisms : critics’ ratings of the same wines through “blind” and “nonblind” tastings . The ﬁndings indicate that after controlling for the value of ratings assigned blindly , the wines made by wineries spanning styles continue to receive lower ratings in the nonblind situation . Key words : organization theory ; organizational ecology ; market categories History : Published online in Articles in Advance September 10 , 2012 . 1 . Introduction A growing number of studies in economic sociology and organization theory demonstrate how social cate - gories affect individual and ﬁrm outcomes in a variety of market situations ( Zuckerman 1999 , Hannan et al . 2007 , Hannan 2010 ) . As collective construals that par - tition individuals , products , and organizations , cate - gories have been shown to inﬂuence diverse phenomena including the divestment of incoherent lines of business ( Zuckerman 2000 ) , the coherence of stock price move - ment ( Zuckerman , 2004 ) , critical appeal ( Hsu 2006 , Negro et al . 2010a , Kovács and Hannan 2010 ) , the change of production methods ( Negro et al . 2011 ) , the assessment of producers’ legitimacy and value ( Rosa et al . 1999 , Rao et al . 2005 ) , creditworthiness of busi - nesses and the equity of their ratings ( Fleischer 2009 , Ruef and Patterson 2009 ) , the competitive positioning of producers ( Porac et al . 1995 , Waguespack and Sorenson 2011 ) , managerial compensation ( Porac et al . 1999 ) , and vital rates of organizational populations ( Bogaert et al . 2010 , Carroll et al . 2010 ) . The typical ﬁnding to date suggests that producers focusing their efforts on one or few market categories perform better than those who attempt to span multiple ones ( Hannan 2010 ) . Two distinct arguments are offered for this observed regularity—a so - called producer - side mechanism and an audience - side mechanism ( Hsu et al . 2009 ) . The producer - side argument suggests that there are operational difﬁculties that producers face when attempting to span disparate categories . Because the organization is targeting several categorical niches , it risks offering products of lower intrinsic quality across any one ( Freeman and Hannan 1983 , Dobrev et al . 2001 ) . The audience - side argument suggests that the dis - count occurs because the identities of category spanners are unclear , and therefore such products and produc - ers are perceived as more difﬁcult to situate , under - stand , and / or evaluate ( Zuckerman 1999 , Rao et al . 2005 , Hsu 2006 ) . A challenge remains in disentangling these two pro - cesses because although conceptually distinct , they are related and empirically co - occurring . For example , spe - cialized critics are involved in assignments of genre labels to ﬁlms , but studios and distributors claim mem - bership of projects in categories by using genres in various stages of the organizing process , from research - ing spectator preferences , to hiring technical crews and artists whose work is limited to certain types of ﬁlms , to promoting ﬁlms to exhibitors . Accordingly , the category - spanning discount can combine effects driven by audience and producer mechanisms simultaneously . The evaluation of underlying content is confounded by provenance . This study contributes to the literature on market categories by producing evidence that perceptual , and not merely actual , effects underlie the observed link between category specialism and greater market success . We examine whether and to what extent the audience - side mechanism linked to category - spanning affects eval - uation . Our main argument is that when the identity of the producer is directly observable , the audience can 684 Negro and Leung : “Actual” and Perceptual Effects of Category Spanning Organization Science 24 ( 3 ) , pp . 684 – 696 , ©2013 INFORMS 685 connect the membership of the producer in a category to the collective representation of that category , or schema . Given this , we expect that increasing nonconformity by a producer , as realized by category spanning , will result in worse ﬁt to this recognized schema . Its products should therefore be perceived as less appealing . Some studies have been able to empirically sepa - rate mechanisms that similarly co - occur by leverag - ing the research design advantages of certain settings . Waguespack and Sorenson ( 2011 ) were able to demon - strate how the status of a ﬁlm studio—in particular , its powerful position within the industry—affected parental guidance classiﬁcation of ﬁlms . They show that despite underlying similarities in potentially objectionable con - tent , ﬁlms from major Hollywood studios receive more lenient ratings than ﬁlms from independent production companies . Roberts et al . ( 2011 ) isolated the symbolic effect of a winemaker’s prominence on the prices of wines net of their actual contribution to the quality of the wine by exploiting the timing of wine releases . Hir - ing winemakers from prominent wineries increases the retail price of wines , even of those that were harvested and aging before the winemaker joined the organization . To test our arguments , we investigate a setting that permits us to separate the audience - side from producer - side mechanisms : critical ratings of wines by two critics , both of which are highly respected but differ in their approach to how they rate their wines . One conducts blind tastings ; i . e . , all information regarding the pro - ducer is hidden during the tasting . The other does not . More speciﬁcally , we utilize ratings assigned through blind tastings as an assessment of the underlying char - acteristics of the wines and examine whether , after accounting for these ratings , the spanning of winemak - ing styles by producers affects the ratings of their wines assigned through nonblind tastings . Our ﬁndings indicate that , controlling for the underlying quality characteris - tics of their wines , wineries increasingly spanning wine - making styles receive lower ratings . In short , the rating discount from multiple category membership remains signiﬁcant . The rest of this paper is organized as follows . The second section reviews the literature on multiple categor - ical memberships and the category - spanning disadvan - tage . We identify two hypotheses reﬂecting our focus on two separate mechanisms . The empirical setting is then detailed in § 3 , along with attention to describing the two wine critics and their different approaches to tasting and rating wines . We then present results from our empirical analysis in § 4 and conclude with remarks discussing the contribution of the study in § 5 . 2 . Market Categories , Producer Identity , and Category Spanning Categories are sociocognitive partitions that can be applied in any social domain including markets , grouping objects considered similar along certain dimen - sions ( Zerubavel 1997 ) . For example , ﬁlms are clustered into genres such as “Western” or “horror , ” food styles are clustered into cuisines such as “sushi” or “contem - porary , ” and stocks are rated into groups such as “market outperformer” or “market underperformer . ” Categories , in this sense , reﬂect shared understandings between mar - ket participants as to how similar producers and / or prod - ucts can be clustered together and labeled . Note that not all objects fall neatly into a single cate - gory , and categories do not always have clearly deﬁned boundaries . For example , some ﬁlms are labeled horror and sci - ﬁ because they combine plotlines and characters typical of both genres . Similarly , certain music styles , such as “ambient , ” do not have a clearly demarcated form ; works using either acoustic or electronic instru - ments , or no instruments at all , can be labeled as ambi - ent . In this sense , category memberships are partial , and categories are said to be fuzzy . Recently , a number of studies demonstrated that social objects that combine features from multiple categories are discounted ; that is , they experience lower market performance and are deemed as less appealing by an audience ( for a review , see Hannan 2010 , Negro et al . 2010b ) . In general , these studies adopt the view that markets are organized as interfaces in which ( i ) produc - ers present offerings to appeal to ( ii ) an audience that evaluates them ( Zuckerman 1999 , Hannan et al . 2007 ) . As sketched above , these are the two distinct but related arguments that explain the source of the market discount from multiple category membership—an audience - side and a producer - side mechanism . The ﬁrst argument relates to the perceptions that audi - ences hold of the features of a market agent and its offer - ings relative to sets of expectations . Zuckerman ( 1999 ) identiﬁed how stock analysts were confused by com - panies that straddle established industry classes . Stock analysts specialize by industry , and their expertise in evaluating companies is limited to these industry groups . Companies whose operations cross industry boundaries extend beyond what the more specialized analysts under - stand and are more difﬁcult to evaluate . They are more likely to be ignored by these analysts . If evaluated , how - ever , producers spanning categories are directly judged as less appealing . In the study by Rao et al . ( 2005 ) of French haute cuisine , traditional and nouvelle cuisines are seen as having incompatible identities , and the chefs who combine dishes from the different styles in their menus receive lower ratings by the inﬂuential Michelin Guide . Hannan et al . ( 2007 ) and Hsu et al . ( 2009 ) formal - ized this argument in terms of niche theory’s princi - ple of allocation ( see also Freeman and Hannan 1983 , Dobrev et al . 2001 ) . A niche deﬁnes the social space in which a producer can persist and thrive or , in the lan - guage of the theory , has positive ﬁtness . The niche space Negro and Leung : “Actual” and Perceptual Effects of Category Spanning 686 Organization Science 24 ( 3 ) , pp . 684 – 696 , ©2013 INFORMS is ﬁxed , so occupying a wider niche and , by implica - tion , spanning multiple categories in a diverse market , reduces an actor’s ﬁtness in any one category . Spanning categories is linked to poor correspondence between the features of the producer and the representation of the categories , or schemas , in the sense that the producer matches some feature values of one schema and oth - ers of other schemas . In a study of the U . S . brew - ing industry , Carroll and Swaminathan ( 2000 ) outlined key features that deﬁne the schema for “microbrewers , ” including small - scale production , handcrafted methods , and natural ingredients . Engaged beer consumers often reject beverages made by contract brewers , which miss some of these key features and display features typical of the production system of mass brewers , despite the fact that they could produce beer of equal quality to that of the microbrewers . As a result of poor correspondence to schemas , a can - didate spanning multiple categories is regarded as less appealing . This prediction is consistent with research in cognitive psychology and consumer behavior suggesting that congruity of an object to a schema leads to favor - able responses because , other things being equal , peo - ple like objects that conform to their expectations , allow predictability , and require less extensive cognitive elab - oration ( Rosch 1978 , Garbarino and Edell 1997 ) . The brewery example points to another important aspect of the theory . In markets , the audience can often evalu - ate the ﬁt to a schema when it can connect the iden - tity of the producer to visible features . In other words , a beer enthusiast expresses dislike for contract brew - eries and their products when their production methods and ingredients are visible to them . When such visibil - ity is absent , or limited because of successful deception ( Phillips and Kim 2009 ) , the loss of appeal is more difﬁ - cult to observe . This argument does not imply an actual lack of skill or ability on the part of the candidate but rather points to risks inherent in not adhering to a rec - ognized schema - based identity . A second argument has been proposed for the exis - tence of a market discount from multiple category membership that implicates skill development or learning—that there is an actual functional reason for the discount . This discount is hypothesized to originate from the producer side . Hannan et al . ( 2007 ) and Hsu et al . ( 2009 ) argued that producers have limited atten - tion , time , and material resources to devote to maintain - ing their ﬁtness with a particular niche—what they term engagement . These producers , or candidates , have to choose how to allocate their limited engagement across multiple categorical niches . Spreading one’s effort , or engagement , across several categories means that one will be less well prepared to address the needs of any single one . As Hsu et al . ( 2009 ) demonstrated , those eBay sellers who listed items across several different product categories were less facile at engaging with their audience . Speciﬁcally , these generalist sellers were less likely to use category - speciﬁc acronyms in their listings , thereby demonstrating their reduced expertise in any par - ticular category . Empirically , the difﬁculty in teasing the “actual” ver - sus “perceptual” mechanisms apart lies with the fact that the audience is often aware of the underlying charac - teristics as well as the provenance of the producer and product . It therefore becomes challenging to determine whether audience - side or producer - side effects drive market evaluation . On one hand , the superior underly - ing features can be the reason for a favorable judgment . On the other hand , the knowledge of the identity of the producer can sway the audience’s opinions as well . Waguespack and Sorenson ( 2011 ) highlighted this issue in their study of how U . S . ﬁlms are rated by the Motion Picture Association of America ( MPAA ) industry asso - ciation and showed that , controlling for the underlying content of a movie , the identity of the movie studio affects the leniency with which a ﬁlm is rated by the MPAA as suitable for general versus adult viewers . They ﬁnd that the major , and more powerful , movie studios rated favorably in the past are more likely to receive more lenient ratings than independent studios that had more restrictive ratings in the past . Another example is the analysis by Roberts et al . ( 2011 ) , which iden - tiﬁed the effect of hiring a prominent winemaker on a winery’s wine prices . The mechanism that leads to observations of increased prices is confounded here as well because a “better” winemaker should improve the quality of wines as well as the prominence of those wines . Roberts et al . ( 2011 ) disentangled these effects by demonstrating that wines that were already aging , and therefore untouched by the more prominent winemaker upon their being hired , also realized an increase in price , a “symbolic” effect of their appointment . One solution to address this challenge is to iden - tify a setting where the information regarding the iden - tity of the producer whose product is being evaluated can be obscured from the audience ( see Simcoe and Waguespack 2011 for an application to organizational status ) . For example , academic journals often utilize a blind review process where the author is supposedly unknown to the reviewer . One reason for using this method is to ensure that the underlying quality of the manuscript , and not confounding factors such as repu - tation or identity of the author , matters for the decision to publish or reject a manuscript . Similarly , symphonies can use “blind” auditions , where a screen obscures the identity of the musician ( Goldin and Rouse 2000 ) , thereby reducing the likelihood of discrimination based on the gender of the performer . In this vein , we identi - ﬁed a research setting where critical ratings of the same products were conducted by two different evaluators— one with knowledge of the producer’s identity and the other without . Negro and Leung : “Actual” and Perceptual Effects of Category Spanning Organization Science 24 ( 3 ) , pp . 684 – 696 , ©2013 INFORMS 687 If a producer’s identity is unknown to the audience , then evaluations made by the audience cannot take this factor into account . The evaluation should therefore reﬂect the underlying characteristics of the product as determined by the abilities of the producer . Accord - ingly , our expectation is that those producers who span multiple categories will be disadvantaged because their products will be of actual lower quality . Therefore , we predict the following in our empirical setting of crit - ical ratings of Italian wines . Hypothesis 1 . Wines made by producers spanning across winemaking styles receive lower ratings in blind tastings . On the other hand , if the producer’s identity is known , the audience can connect the identity to the product . In this instance , perception of the ﬁt to the category schema will also affect the evaluation . Our contention is that spanning categories will lead to lower appeal from this alone . However , this evaluation is confounded with the fact that it can still reﬂect the underlying quality char - acteristics of the products . To determine whether mere knowledge that a producer is spanning categories can lead to poorer critical ratings , we need to partial out the value of the underlying characteristics of the product under consideration . In doing so , we would predict that the remaining effect of category spanning is attributable to perceptual factors . In our empirical setting , critics’ ratings of Italian wines , the argument above leads to the following hypothesis . Hypothesis 2 . Wines made by producers spanning across winemaking styles receive lower ratings in non - blind tastings , even after controlling for ratings assigned blindly . 3 . Methods 3 . 1 . Styles of Making Barolo and Barbaresco Wines The empirical details contained in this section draw from ﬁeldwork conducted between 2005 and 2009 , includ - ing visits to 45 winemakers , wine critics , and oenolo - gists in Italy . Barolo and Barbaresco wines come from the district called the Langhe , located in the south - eastern corner of the Piemonte region , a short distance from the French and Swiss borders . Most wineries are family businesses and very small in scale by world - wide standards . Many of the better - known producers in this region , such Cantina Bartolo Mascarello , pro - duce approximately 30 , 000 bottles ( about 2 , 500 cases ) per year . In comparison , New York - based Constellation Brands sells approximately 75 million cases annually . The production of these wines is subject to a writ - ten legal code , the disciplinare di produzione . It states that these wines can be produced from only one grape varietal—Nebbiolo—grown in speciﬁcally delim - ited areas . Barolo must come from vineyards in 11 vil - lages in the Cuneo province and must be aged for three years , or ﬁve years if designated as a riserva ( reserve ) . Barbaresco comes from vineyards in four villages in an adjoining southern district in the same province , and it requires only two years of aging , or four years if des - ignated as a riserva . ( For the purpose of our analysis , Barolos and Barbarescos do not differ in other mean - ingful ways . ) Of note is the fact that the disciplinare is silent on several other choices regarding the viniﬁcation process , including the kind of barrels that producers can use for the aging of their Barolos and Barbarescos . Events beginning in the 1980s led to the partitioning of winemaking into modernist , traditional , and middle styles , resulting in strong identity claims ( Negro et al . 2010a , 2011 ) . Traditionally , casks as large as 120 hec - toliters ( hl ) made from Slovenian oak or chestnut wood ( botti ) were used to age Barolo and Barbaresco wines . During the 1980s , a group of wineries came to question the validity of established methods . They maintained that the aromas and volatile acidity of traditional wines often lead to a ﬂawed product . Lack of color , strong tannins , and off - putting aromas were frequent critiques . These wineries , categorized as modernists or international ( as we follow here ) , introduced various changes , including reduced yields in the vineyard and a shorter maceration period . The pivotal element , however , was the vessel used for the aging . Producers began aging wine in barriques , small barrels ( usually 2 . 25 hl ) made from aromatic French oak . Such producers aimed at wines with greater concentration , softer tannins , and darker color that were more in line with the taste of international markets . Angelo Gaja is regarded as the initiator of the use of bar - riques for these wines . His lead was followed by others , notably Elio Altare , who is also known for an emblem - atic episode : after failing to convince his father to allow production in barriques , he destroyed his family’s botti with a chainsaw in 1982 . For many , this act symbol - ized the intensity of the controversy that erupted in the Langhe . Modernism sparked a defense around regional typical - ity that sought to preserve traditional practices , notably the use of botti , as the essence of authenticity . Many of the traditional wineries we interviewed motivated their resistance to change in technical and cultural terms . Some said to us that they like their wine to “taste nat - ural , without too much wood ﬂavor” but also that they decided to remain close to conventional practices . One of them said , “We are deeply rooted in this region and in the simple life . We search for the authenticity of things , and live in the simplicity of the land . Would you believe that we never had a TV ? We like living this way . ” Negro and Leung : “Actual” and Perceptual Effects of Category Spanning 688 Organization Science 24 ( 3 ) , pp . 684 – 696 , ©2013 INFORMS Our ﬁeldwork also suggests that greater diversity in methods and styles persists despite the opposition between tradition and modernity . The prevailing view among producers , critics , and enthusiasts acknowledges the existence of a distinct “middle” style in which winer - ies use both barriques and larger botti casks ( typically in this sequence ) to age a wine . A coeditor of the inﬂuen - tial wine guide edited by Gambero Rosso said to us that the debate in an “either / or” proposition that “you use either barriques or casks” is “somewhat naïve ; I think you can in fact use both . ” The audience recognizes three styles , but some debate remains as to whether barrique - only and barrique - and - botti wines are just variations of a single international style . To make our test simpler , we focus on the categories where the contraposition is clearer . Accordingly , we identify two “pure” categorical wine styles : ( i ) botti only and ( ii ) barrique only . Although the choices about maceration , yeasts , and temperature control also affect taste , these features also tend to be obscured ; barriques have rather detectable effects on the wine and are identiﬁable . Producers , crit - ics , and consumers consider the type of barrels used for aging as the key feature that distinguishes member - ship in a wine style . The aging methods thus serve what Hannan et al . ( 2007 , p . 82 ) deﬁned as a minimal test code for categorization . In other words , audience mem - bers use some critical features to make inferences about the ﬁt to the rest of the schema on which they have dif - ﬁculty observing a priori . If the audience believes that a producer “passes” the test , then it is assumed that the unperceived / nondefault values of schema - relevant features also ﬁt the schema ( Rosch and Mervis 1975 , Rosch 1978 ) . 3 . 2 . Approaches to Wine Tasting Our analyses use ratings and other information on winer - ies and wines from two specialized publications : I Vini di Veronelli , known as the Veronelli guide , and I Vini d’Italia , which is published by Gambero Rosso Editore and the Slow Food organization and known as the Gambero Rosso guide . 1 These guides offer wide and deep coverage of Italian wineries and labels , and they are considered reliable by previous studies ( Odorici and Corrado 2004 ; Negro et al . 2010a , 2011 ) . The Veronelli guide reviews more than 10 , 000 wines by 2 , 000 - plus wineries every year and has been published since 1991 . The guide was founded and led by Luigi Veronelli , who was widely considered the most inﬂuential Italian wine intellectual and critic from the 1950s to his death in 2004 . Analogously to the Veronelli guide , the Gambero Rosso guide covers a vast selection of the country’s labels , including over 2 , 200 wineries and 16 , 000 wines in recent editions . Overall , these two guides cover more wines and producers than competing domestic publica - tions or international sources such as the Wine Advocate . The two guides target wine connoisseurs as well as nonexperts including wine merchants , restaurant som - meliers , and consumers . The publications have earned audience respect—they are deemed the most prominent in Italy—and the list of the wines that receive their high - est honors is routinely covered by the national press and is employed by other experts and commentators for their recommendations . The entries of the guide are organized by locality and producer . Ratings from these guides matter to the commercial success of wines . In an interview with the authors , one of the ( now former ) editors of the Gambero Rosso guide said , “After they receive the highest ratings , some pro - ducers raise their prices a lot (cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:48) (cid:48) When the list is ofﬁ - cial , former ‘friends’ who didn’t win are not friends anymore . This gives me a great responsibility because I know that my evaluations will affect these produc - ers and their businesses . ” To determine whether ratings signiﬁcantly affect the consumer market , we gathered data on the online prices of Barolo and Barbaresco labels using the website http : / / www . wine - searcher . com , which has retail price listings from over 7 , 800 mer - chants of wines from around the world ( the prices men - tioned in the guides are suggested by the producer and not actual market prices ) . In the appendix , we present regression estimates suggesting signiﬁcant effects of rat - ings by these Italian critics on international retail wine prices . For example , receiving the highest accolade from Veronelli increases prices by about 25 % . In this sense , the setting is not unlike many other cultural industries where domestic ratings affect the international perfor - mance of products . In ﬁlm , for example , U . S . movies generate most of their revenues outside the domestic market , but U . S . critics such as Rogert Ebert or Variety inﬂuence reception internationally . Both guides use ratings to communicate assessments of labeled wines . However , they differ in their approach to how wines are tasted and rated . The star ratings included in the Veronelli guide are supplied for individ - ual wines after one or multiple tastings conducted by Luigi Veronelli and his three collaborators ( all of whom have continued to edit the guide after Veronelli’s death ) . One of the guide editors , who has done most of the tast - ings of Barolos and Barbarescos for Veronelli , explained that he has information , albeit incomplete , about the wine—the critic at least knows the producer’s identity and other information that typically includes wine type , the area of production , and the vintage . When we inter - viewed him , he said that the tastings are conducted during individual visits to the wineries , often from the barrel . In addition to the ratings , the Veronelli guide reports further details about each wine including the type of method used for the aging . Demonstrating the extent to which the barrel type has been used to demarcate cat - egory boundaries , symbols appear in the entry for each Negro and Leung : “Actual” and Perceptual Effects of Category Spanning Organization Science 24 ( 3 ) , pp . 684 – 696 , ©2013 INFORMS 689 wine to indicate whether the wine had been aged in botti or barriques ( or both ) . The information is provided to the editors by the producers . We conﬁrmed the coding of the data culled from the guide by conducting a tele - phone survey in 2006 of all producers in the data set to conﬁrm their choices of viniﬁcation methods for each of their wines . On the other hand , for the Gambero Rosso guide , the tastings are conducted by wine tasters divided into regional groups , with different wine labels sampled uni - formly by type and vintage . Tasters do not know the price category of the wine or the identity of the winery . In a meeting in late 2005 , one of the editors of the Gambero Rosso guide explained to us their approach : “ [ T ] he guide is made with the contribution of more than 120 – 130 tasters who make the selections in every geo - graphical area (cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:48) activities , primarily tasting , are coordi - nated by commissions that are responsible for bringing in the samples from a region or a relevant winemaking area . We use blind tasting (cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:48) (cid:48) Our tastings are collec - tive , and so the decision is collegial . When we decide the Tre Bicchieri ( the highest rating ) , we are in a group of 8 – 10 tasters . ” The collectivist nature of these tastings also suggests that the ratings are unlikely to reﬂect the idiosyncratic tastes of a particular critic . Interviews with critics reveal that both of the guides employ schemas for the aging styles . This is important , because we want to ensure the evaluations of a wine’s underlying characteristics made by the two critics are based on some criteria ( the criteria can still differ , as dis - cussed below ) . An essential difference with the Gambero Rosso guide is that tasters do not know the identity of the winery whose wine is being rated . However , crit - ics of both guides approach the tastings with the style types in mind . In the introduction to the 2006 edition , the Gambero Rosso editors stated that the tastings are “comparative” in the sense that a wine is judged against other wines from the same zone and vintage . The editors note that their judgment criteria include “factors that cannot be evaluated in merely sensory terms , concepts like a wine’s conformity with or representativeness of its type (cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:48) (cid:48) Wine should be good but should also be representative . ” This corroborates previous research sug - gesting that both Gambero Rosso and Veronelli ratings are generally positively correlated ( Negro et al . 2010a ) . The coeditor of the 2006 Veronelli guide , Daniel Thomases , also noted that the primary thing he searches for in a wine is the correspondence between the ter - ritory and the vintage . Then , two main criteria are applied : “One is the nose , the smell . The second feature is the body , the structure . ” This source , however , goes further in detailing the beliefs that accompany the eval - uation process . Thomases said , “It happens that some producers were not too sure about which way to go , what technique to use , so they offer two products here and two products there (cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:48) (cid:48) When that happens , I ﬁnd it strange . A producer’s line of products should reﬂect a speciﬁc zone as well as that producer’s philosophy . A winery is not a supermarket . ” From these descriptions we expect that , given that attention and resources are limited , a winery spanning multiple styles knows and learns less about any style than a producer focusing on only one . The resulting engagement ought to be reﬂected in the lower “actual” quality of the wine in blind tastings . Moreover , external earmarks , particularly the identity of a winery , will make evident the spanning of styles in the evaluation of wines by the Veronelli guide because they will be aware of the incongruence between identity and the wines they taste . The evidence of spanning styles will affect evaluations that the wines receive beyond their potentially inferior quality or the speciﬁc preference for the style in which they are made . 3 . 3 . Data and Measures Our data cover all Barolo and Barbaresco wine labels listed in the Gambero Rosso and Veronelli guides from their ﬁrst editions ( 1988 and 1991 , respectively ) to 2006 . The wineries we study are subject to stringent produc - tion standards , and the relevant Italian law sets a mini - mum aging period before the product can be released in the market . For Barolos and Barbarescos , this period is two and three years , respectively , but it increases to ﬁve years for riserva wines . Critics review wines upon release , so this rule imposes a systematic lag structure on the rating process and , consequently , on our data . To allow for comparability across the producers , we end our observation window before the vintage 2001 . Our ﬁeldwork revealed that experimentation with cellar tech - niques was negligible before the 1980s . Despite the fact that the guide goes back to review a few notable wines in earlier vintages , we start our analysis in 1981 . Our sample thus comprises all the labels of Barbarescos and Barolos from the vintages 1981 – 2000 that were reviewed by the Veronelli and Gambero Rosso guides . This initial sample includes 1 , 926 label – vintage – producer observations for 164 producers—the same used by Negro et al . ( 2010a ) minus 26 observations lost due to missing values in one covariate not included therein . The estimation generally follows that analysis with minor differences noted below . 3 . 3 . 1 . Dependent Variable . We used the ratings received by the Veronelli and Gambero Rosso guides to measure how favorably a wine was evaluated . The Veronelli guide uses a four - point scale to communi - cate assessments of labeled wines and assigns a rating expressed in stars , ranging from one ( “good wine” ) to three ( “excellent wine” ) . ( Since the 1992 edition , the guide assigns a trifolium symbol to products reviewed for the ﬁrst time , which indicates the overall good qual - ity of the wine , but this does not imply any speciﬁc rating . These wines , and consequently the producers Negro and Leung : “Actual” and Perceptual Effects of Category Spanning 690 Organization Science 24 ( 3 ) , pp . 684 – 696 , ©2013 INFORMS whose wines are all rated for the ﬁrst time , are not included in the analyses . ) The guide also confers an award of distinction ( “super three stars” ) to wines con - sidered outstanding , which we coded as four stars . This star rating expresses a general evaluation of a wine’s fea - tures , or , as the editor put it , “the wine’s speed cruise . ” The Gambero Rosso guide assigns one black glass , two black glasses , two red glasses , and three red glasses ( where red is a higher ranking than black ) . In these instances , we treated two red glasses as a value of 3 and three red glasses as a value of 4 . 3 . 3 . 2 . Independent Variables . The ﬁrst independent variable is producers’ spanning across wine styles . Each producer can demonstrate categorical adherence by pro - ducing wines that are more or less focused in a particular style—traditional or international . Producers can release multiple wines each year , and each wine can be vini - ﬁed using one of the two different techniques , botti or barriques ( or a mix ) , as described previously . We follow the notion that the two categories corre - spond to styles associated with each method of pro - duction ( aging ) . With the understanding that wines are released each year , a winery’s portfolio , and therefore spanning , can change depending on the methods used to make their wines . A winery can focus and not span by producing wines only in one style . For example , Bartolo Mascarello and Giacomo Conterno are representative of the traditional category and use only botti ; La Spinetta is representative of the international style and uses only barriques . Wineries such as Poderi Luigi Einaudi make wines in all styles and show a signiﬁcant degree of span - ning . Style spanning is expressed by an index of con - centration ( 1 minus the Simpson’s index of diversity ) , calculated as the sum of the squared proportions of the wines in a winery’s portfolio made in each style in a vintage . More formally , Style spanning (cid:56)(cid:140)(cid:52)s(cid:49)x(cid:49)t(cid:53)(cid:57) = 1 − (cid:88) s ∈ S (cid:140) 2 (cid:52)s(cid:49)x(cid:49)t(cid:53)(cid:49) where s ∈ S is the set of winemaking styles in our anal - ysis for winery x at time t . This measure ranges from 0 to 0 . 5 , where 0 . 5 means they produced wines equally in each of the two styles ( and are maximally spanning ) , and 0 means they only released wines in one style ( and are not spanning at all ) . The hypotheses are tested by including style spanning as a covariate when estimating the ratings assigned by the wine guides . As a control for the underlying qual - ity characteristics of the wine ( Benjamin and Podolny 1999 ) , we add on the right - hand side of the regression equation the rating assigned blindly by the Gambero Rosso guide to each wine in the sample . 3 . 3 . 3 . Control Variables . Our models include con - trols for additional observable product characteristics , producer characteristics , and contextual factors . First , we include two dichotomous variables equal to 1 if the wine is a riserva or a cru ( a “ﬁrst - growth” place ) . Reserve wines age for a longer period , and cru wines are viniﬁed from particular vineyards . Second , we recognize that spanning can occur at the product level as well as the producer level and that critics may have preferences for speciﬁc styles of wine . We created a pair of dichotomous variables , barrique - only wine and barrique – botti wine , and set them equal to 1 if the wine was aged using only barrique or was aged using barriques and botti together , respectively , and 0 otherwise . This leaves the traditional wines ( botti ) as the reference category . We add a control for the status of the winery to account for halo effects that can inﬂuence the ratings and include a variable measuring the lagged maximum rating awarded to a winery by the Veronelli guide . Missing values in this covariate reduce the sample by 26 observations compared to that used by Negro et al . ( 2010a ) , which did not include this variable in the esti - mates . A variable counting the number of Barolo and Barbaresco labels released by the winery in each vintage , number of labels , is added to address that style spanning increases with the number of different wines made by a producer . Finally , we add ( but do not report ) ﬁxed effects for each vintage to account for weather - related ﬂuc - tuations and other unobserved time - dependent effects . A summary of the variables in the regressions and their correlations is reported in Tables 1 and 2 . The star rating outcome is an ordered categorical variable . However , cut - point estimates obtained from an ordered logistic regression of the number of stars received by a wine did not suggest signiﬁcant devi - ations from linearity . Thus , to ease interpretation , the estimates we report are obtained using ordinary least squares ( OLS ) regression with robust standard errors clustered by producer to adjust for within - winery corre - lation . Results of these OLS estimates are presented in Tables 3 and 4 . In Table 5 we present additional results obtained using winery ﬁxed - effects regression and gen - eralized random effects at the winery level to address whether the effects of category spanning stem from between - producer variation or within - producer variation .

The effect of prior maximum stars , our control for the sta - tus of a winemaker , is signiﬁcant and positive , suggest - ing that past demonstrations of value lead to success in future years as well ( Roberts and Reagans 2007 ) . We contend that this effect is attributable to superior product quality because the raters taste the wines blindly . In Table 4 we estimate the effects of category span - ning on the ratings assigned to wines by the Veronelli guide . Model 1 estimates the effect of the control vari - ables . Of the ones that show a signiﬁcant effect , they generally behave as expected . Note again the positive and statistically signiﬁcant effect of prior maximum stars ( X 2 = 264 (cid:48) 02 , p = 0 (cid:48) 000 , df = 1 ) . Wines that are des - ignated as reserve or come from a ﬁrst - growth vineyard are more favorably rated . Wines aged in barriques are preferred by the critics as well , perhaps because these wines , aged only in small barrels , tend to reach a more mature taste earlier , as they lose hard tannins faster . Model 2 includes the covariate measuring category spanning , and we ﬁnd that greater spanning across wine - making styles reduces ratings signiﬁcantly ( X 2 = 7 (cid:48) 80 , p = 0 (cid:48) 005 , df = 1 ) .

We can , however , interpret the coefﬁcient . For a one - standard - deviation increase in style spanning by a winemaker , the wine produced is predicted to have a 0 . 04 star discount ( − 0 (cid:48) 2165 × 0 (cid:48) 185 ) , holding all other variables constant . Model 3 adds the covariate measuring the Gambero Rosso ratings , which are obtained from blind tast - ings and , as demonstrated above , act as a control for the underlying quality of the wine . Not surprisingly , the covariate has a positive and signiﬁcant effect on the star rating received from the Veronelli guide , suggest - ing that nonblind evaluations also incorporate “actual” quality ( X 2 = 115 (cid:48) 5 , p < 0 (cid:48) 000 , df = 1 ) . Interestingly , and more to our point , the negative effect of style span - ning by the individual winery continues to reduce rat - ings , despite controls for the Gambero Rosso glasses ( X 2 = 5 (cid:48) 47 , p = 0 (cid:48) 019 , df = 1 ) . Including controls for blind ratings , a one - standard - deviation increase in style spanning is predicted to decrease the star ratings a wine receives by 0 . 03 ( − 0 (cid:48) 174 × 0 (cid:48) 185 ) , holding all other variables constant . Note that our models also include controls for the methods with which the wine was aged ; thus , wineries spanning styles receive lower ratings even after accounting for a wine’s speciﬁc style . This result now lends direct support to our second hypothesis . Figure 1 plots the predicted star ratings the Veronelli guide would award a wine as a function of the observed range of style spanning from the estimates contained in Models 2 and 3 . The ﬁgure shows that as style spanning increases , the predicted star rating by the Veronelli guide drops , when all other variables are at their means . The lower , solid line represents the reduction in Veronelli star ratings that a wine will receive as a function of both revealed identity and blindly assigned Gambero Rosso rating , which was derived from Model 2 above as the Veronelli rating without a control for blind rating . The effect on Veronelli star ratings of identity only , upon the inclusion of a control for Gambero Rosso rating , is represented by the upper , dashed line . Here , we see that spanning by a winery continues to negatively affect how their wines are rated , even controlling for actual quality . More speciﬁcally , a winery that moves from aging wines exclusively in botti to aging half of their wines with barriques ( representing a move from 0 span - ning to 0 . 5 ) sees a reduction in star ratings for its wines from actual and perceptual effects of 0 . 11 stars Figure 1 Plot of Change in Predicted Number of Stars Received by the Veronelli Guide as a Function of Style Spanning for the Regression in Models 2 and 3 – 0 . 3 – 0 . 2 – 0 . 1 0 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 S t a r r a ti ng s Producer spanning Style spanning Style spanning ( Accounting for GR rating ) Note .

The same winery risks a reduction in star ratings of 0 . 09 ( − 0 (cid:48) 174 × 0 (cid:48) 5 ) merely from their demonstrations of identity - confusing features . Although this seems like a modest effect , we can evaluate a mar - ket implication . Our analysis in the appendix indicates that the average effect of Veronelli’s star ratings on retail prices is worth about 7 . 3 dollars . The effect of style spanning then translates into approximately 75 cents per bottle . Considering the very small size of the wineries in the Langhe , which typically sell 30 , 000 – 50 , 000 bot - tles of Barolo and Barbaresco wines yearly , the overall impact of spanning can reduce the value of retail sales on the international market by about 30 thousand dollars , a not insigniﬁcant amount . Another way to examine this effect is to look at the relative importance of spanning on actual versus per - ceptual discounts . In this particular case , approximately 80 % ( 0 . 174 / 0 . 217 ) of the rating decrease due to style spanning for the Veronelli guide is associated with the audience connecting the identity of the winery to the schemas of winemaking styles . We return to the substan - tive implication of this ﬁnding in the Discussion section . Of note , in Model 3 , a winery’s status , as measured by its prior maximum stars , continues to increase rat - ings . The ﬁnding that status is correlated with and indeed a reward for value is not novel ; often , however , status processes are difﬁcult to separate from quality or the role of power . Because we control for underlying value of the product , this effect can reﬂect deference and / or power . Recall that in our setting producers are of very small size , thereby making it unlikely they will occupy dominant positions that make them capable of threat - ening critics , although our informants noted that some winemakers may weaken their good relations if rated unfavorably . Then , the maximum stars likely capture a signiﬁcant deference effect . Next we deal with two empirical concerns . One is that our clustered standard errors can still be sub - ject to misspeciﬁcation of the correlation structure between observations affecting the consistency of our estimates . Second , our analyses can imply both within - and between - producer effects of style spanning . Model 4 estimates panel regressions with generalized random effects ; we used the method of generalized estimation equations ( GEEs ) implemented with an exchangeable error structure at the producer level . This allows a ran - dom producer effect subject to the constraint that the random effects are uncorrelated between producers and that the correlation over time of the random effects is constant . Then , in Model 5 we present estimates of ﬁxed - effects regressions . Whereas the previous model speciﬁcations use all the observed variation , ﬁxed - effects regression considers the relationship between changes in style spanning and critical ratings within each pro - ducer . The advantage of this method is that it removes the effect of any unobservable producer characteristics that can bias the impact of spanning . Results in both analyses continue to support the argument that style spanning exerts a negative effect on nonblind ratings by the Veronelli guide in the presence of controls for actual quality . The ratings could be inﬂuenced by aims of differen - tiation or conformity of one critic vis - à - vis the other . If this were the case , then the timing of a review versus another could identify whether the critics are “follow - ing” each other or not . Both guides are published every year in October within days from each other and mostly review newly released wines , and we believe that the opportunity for inﬂuence is limited . However , in our data , 137 wines were reviewed in an earlier edition by the Gambero Rosso guide , and these reviews could be “used” by the Veronelli guide to distinguish from or imi - tate the other guide . Model 6 reestimates our main model by adding a dummy for wines that were reviewed ﬁrst by the Gambero Rosso guide . This variable does not affect the Veronelli ratings , suggesting that these wines are not evaluated differently , nor interfere with other effects . In unreported analyses , we did not ﬁnd any signiﬁcant interaction with the main covariates . We proffer that the value of underlying quality can change over time and that our estimation approach to include the Gambero Rosso ratings as a control does not measure the producer - side effect of category spanning equally well over the course of the analysis period . If that were the case , one could detect time variation of the estimates of the Gambero Rosso ratings coefﬁcient . In Model 7 we add to the main speciﬁcation a calendar year clock and its interaction term with the Gambero Rosso ratings . The interaction , while leaving the other ﬁndings unaltered , does not show statistical signiﬁcance and does not improve the explanatory power of the model over the main speciﬁcation of Model 3 . 5 . Discussion The ﬁndings reported above support our general hypothesis that producers spanning multiple categories experience lower market success in the form of lower ratings assigned by specialized critics . Our empirical set - ting allowed us to distinguish between two conditions under which wines were rated—one where the iden - tity of the producer was known and the other where it was unknown . This allowed us to separately identify a skill - based mechanism from a perception - based one , both of which have been invoked to explain the category - spanning discount ( Zuckerman 1999 , Hsu 2006 , Hannan et al . 2007 , Hannan 2010 ) . In particular , our analysis indicated that once we con - trolled for the underlying quality of wines , as expressed by ratings assigned by critics conducting blind tastings , the wines made by producers spanning wine styles con - tinued to receive lower ratings . A noteworthy result is Negro and Leung : “Actual” and Perceptual Effects of Category Spanning 694 Organization Science 24 ( 3 ) , pp . 684 – 696 , ©2013 INFORMS that the category - spanning discount we observe seems to be largely intact after actual effects are controlled for ; that is , our comparison of the decrease in ratings attributed to perceptions of identity , after the addition of the blind ratings , suggests an approximate 20 % reduc - tion of the effect of identity on nonblind ratings . This underscores the idea that the identity of a producer plays a dominant role in the evaluation process , at least in these estimates . A possible limitation to our test of the ﬁrst hypoth - esis is the risk that the Gambero Rosso critics inferred the identity of the winemaker at the tasting . That is , when tasting a wine blindly , the critic could guess the categorical identity of the winemaker and thereby judged the wine accordingly . This is a reasonable con - cern to the extent that there is a different taste to the wines produced by different styles and a correla - tion between a producer’s categorical identity and the types of wines they produce . Given the nonexperimen - tal nature of our design , we cannot rule out this pos - sibility for the ﬁrst hypothesis . However , if the ratings from blind tasting act as a “control” for underlying fea - tures , our test for the second hypothesis is actually more conservative ; that is , if the blind tastings account par - tially for “guessed” identity , then the fact that we ﬁnd an effect after this control suggests a very strong effect of “visible” identity on Veronelli ratings ( or it suggests that the Gambero Rosso critics are not guessing or not guessing well ) . In other words , we are unable to deﬁnitely identify whether our measure for quality is completely subsumed by the Veronelli guide or whether the Gambero Rosso critics take into account additional characteristics of the wines that may not be considered by the Veronelli guide . The image this conjures is the potential for two Venn diagrams : one whereby quality characteristics as evalu - ated by the Gambero Rosso guide are a complete sub - set of criteria by which the Veronelli guide rates their wines and another whereby the Gambero Rosso and the Veronelli criteria are two intersecting but not completely overlapping lists . The intersection , in either scenario , is the overlap in quality characteristics that the Veronelli and Gambero Rosso guides both rate on . ( There is an overlap because of the correlated nature of the ratings by the two guides . ) However , we investigated this fur - ther by ﬂipping our analyses by predicting Gambero Rosso ratings with the Veronelli ratings . If the Veronelli guide’s criteria completely subsume all of the Gambero Rosso guide’s , we can still expect a signiﬁcant effect . And indeed , we ﬁnd that the nonblind ratings affect the blind ratings . We also ﬁnd that once we include the Veronelli ratings , producer spanning does not signiﬁ - cantly affect the blind ratings , which further points to the subset interpretation . This study’s main contribution to the growing lit - erature on market categories is to produce direct evi - dence that identity underlies the link between category specialism and greater market success . A previous study of category defection in the wine industry ( Negro et al . 2011 ) demonstrated that higher spanning by some pro - ducers leads to reduced likelihood of traditional pro - ducers leaving their category , ostensibly because those producers who decided not to span across categories ﬁnd value in staying . In this paper , we provide complemen - tary evidence of this process by showing how those same spanning decisions can lead to both quality and identity discounts from other members of the audience , particu - larly critics . The study also offers a general methodological con - tribution . Evaluations in blind and nonblind conditions are appropriate to test the inﬂuence of actual versus per - ceptual mechanisms on audience assessment . In other domains , researchers can replicate our approach and estimate how much each mechanism matters . These conditions are not unique to wine tastings and are found elsewhere—for example , screened auditions in arts ( Goldin and Rouse 2000 ) or commercial releases under pseudonyms ( Phillips and Kim 2009 ) . Our regressions account for a winery’s status , and we ﬁnd that lagged demonstrations of value are asso - ciated with higher ratings ( Roberts and Reagans 2007 ) . In additional analyses , we explored whether the effect of style focus varies with producer status . We did not ﬁnd any signiﬁcant effects of interactions with lagged maximum stars , and these models showed no signiﬁcant ﬁt improvement over the models presented in Table 4 . Additionally , we found nonsigniﬁcant interactions of style focus with the botti and barrique indicators , which can also be used to test differences in status of the prod - uct categories ( details of these tests are available from the authors upon request ) . So the category - spanning result is signiﬁcant not only because it isolates the role of identity from that of underlying characteristics but also because it holds net of the inﬂuence of the status of the producer or product ( Fleischer 2009 , Waguespack and Sorenson 2011 , Roberts et al . 2011 ) . We were also curious as to how spanning differentially affects wines dependent on their ratings . In unreported analyses , we found that the negative effects of spanning were greatest for wines that were rated two or three stars , suggesting that wines that are clearly high or low quality are not as affected by their producer’s identity . We speculate this can be due to the lower uncertainty surrounding these wines . On the other hand , there was likely more uncertainty to rating wines in the middle range . Consequently , the Veronelli critics seemed to be more inﬂuenced by a producer’s identity in these deci - sions . Much work has suggested that under conditions of uncertainty , market participants look to alternative infor - mation of a producer or product’s quality ( Spence 1973 , Zuckerman et al . 2003 ) . In our setting , the clear iden - tity of a producer seems to act as a positive cue to wine critics to increase ratings for wines in this middle range . Negro and Leung : “Actual” and Perceptual Effects of Category Spanning Organization Science 24 ( 3 ) , pp . 684 – 696 , ©2013 INFORMS 695 In unreported analyses , we started exploring one extension of the test presented here . Recent research argues that the perception of category boundaries can shape audience assessments . Hannan et al . ( 2007 ) pro - posed the notion of contrast to describe the degree of distinctiveness categories have against their social back - ground . A category with high contrast means that it stands out more , in the sense that it has sharper and more easily recognizable boundaries . One can expect that with greater contrast the appeal of any offering that ﬁts well into a category will increase . Members of the audi - ence react positively to such clarity ( Zuckerman 2004 , Carroll et al . 2010 , Kovács and Hannan 2010 , Negro et al . 2010a ) . We followed this approach and examined the effect of style contrast , which measures the overall agreement on the schemas applied by the audience to Barolo and Barbaresco wines , calculated as the average style span - ning of all wineries in each vintage ( Bogaert et al . 2010 , Kovács and Hannan 2010 , Carroll et al . 2010 , Negro et al . 2010a ) . We found that style contrast increased the Veronelli ratings when the Gambero Rosso ratings were not controlled for , and separately increased the Gam - bero Rosso ratings . However , it did not signiﬁcantly affect the Veronelli ratings after accounting for the num - ber of glasses awarded by the Gambero Rosso guide . If the role of contrast depended on the priming of a producer’s identity , we would not expect to observe a signiﬁcant effect on the ratings conducted with a blind method . Instead , we did . That higher contrast increases appeal whether the identity of the producer was observ - able or not is consistent with the idea that the activation of schemas does not need deliberation ( DiMaggio 1997 , Murphy 2004 ) . To us , rather than indicating that style contrast does not systematically affect ratings , this pattern suggests that the perception of category boundaries affects simi - larly the evaluation processes of the two critics even if they use different tasting methods . Higher contrast indi - cates greater awareness of category membership , leading to a greater likelihood that particular category schemas will be activated . Instances of a category will be easier to recognize even without priming a producer’s identity , and with increased recognition comes increased liking ( Zajonc 1968 ) . This interpretation also mirrors a central idea in sociological theories of organizations that posits that cognitive representations assume taken - for - granted char - acter and operate tacitly to inﬂuence perceptions and behaviors of market agents ( Meyer and Rowan 1977 , Hannan and Freeman 1989 , DiMaggio and Powell 1983 ) . We must , of course , caution that these implica - tions were examined indirectly , yet we hope that future studies will examine more in depth under what spe - ciﬁc conditions schemas for market categories can be activated .
