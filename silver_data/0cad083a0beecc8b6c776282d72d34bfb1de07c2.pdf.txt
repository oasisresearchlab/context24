Structure - based membrane dome mechanism for Piezo mechanosensitivity Yusong R Guo , Roderick MacKinnon * Laboratory of Molecular Neurobiology and Biophysics , Howard Hughes Medical Institute , The Rockefeller University , New York , United States Abstract Mechanosensitive ion channels convert external mechanical stimuli into electrochemical signals for critical processes including touch sensation , balance , and cardiovascular regulation . The best understood mechanosensitive channel , MscL , opens a wide pore , which accounts for mechanosensitive gating due to in - plane area expansion . Eukaryotic Piezo channels have a narrow pore and therefore must capture mechanical forces to control gating in another way . We present a cryo - EM structure of mouse Piezo1 in a closed conformation at 3 . 7A˚ - resolution . The channel is a triskelion with arms consisting of repeated arrays of 4 - TM structural units surrounding a pore . Its shape deforms the membrane locally into a dome . We present a hypothesis in which the membrane deformation changes upon channel opening . Quantitatively , membrane tension will alter gating energetics in proportion to the change in projected area under the dome . This mechanism can account for highly sensitive mechanical gating in the setting of a narrow , cation - selective pore .

The number of cellular pro - cesses found mediated by Piezo channels is large and growing at a rapid rate ( Eisenhoffer et al . , 2012 ; McHugh et al . , 2012 ; Pathak et al . , 2014 ; Li et al . , 2014 ; Cahalan et al . , 2015 ; Alper , 2017 ) . Their essential biophysical characteristics include responsiveness in gating to mechanical force ( i . e . mechanosensitivity ) and selectivity of the pore for cations ( Gnanasambandam et al . , 2015 ; Lewis and Grandl , 2015 ) . Together , these characteristics allow Piezo channels to serve their many biological functions , including the transduction of mechanical forces into electrical signals in sensory neurons ( Kim et al . , 2012 ; Faucherre et al . , 2013 ; Woo et al . , 2014 ) . Biophysical studies suggest that Piezo channels sense force directly through the lipid membrane ( Cox et al . , 2016 ; Syeda et al . , 2016 ) , although other mechanisms also have been proposed ( Lewis and Grandl , 2015 ; Gottlieb et al . , 2012 ; Peyronnet et al . , 2013 ; Poole et al . , 2014 ; Borbiro et al . , 2015 ) . To understand how mechanical forces might influence the balance between opened and closed states in Piezo channels it is useful to consider the most thoroughly studied and best - understood MS channel , MscL from bacteria ( Sukharev et al . , 1997 ; Perozo et al . , 2002 ; Moe and Blount , 2005 ; Li et al . , 2009 ; Iscla and Blount , 2012 ) . Structural , biophysical and func - tional analyses show that MscL undergoes a large ( ~ 20 nm 2 ) in - plane area expansion when it opens ( Perozo et al . , 2002 ; Chang et al . , 1998 ; Sukharev et al . , 2001 ; Corry et al . , 2010 ) . This area expansion produces a decrease in the free energy of the membrane - channel system if the membrane is under tension , favoring the open state ( Wiggins and Phillips , 2005 ) . An illustration adapted from Ursell et al . ( 2008 ) provides a ‘gravitational analog’ for understanding the origin of the free energy change : as the channel opens and expands in the plane of the membrane , weights are lowered ( Fig - ure 1 ) . The free energy difference between closed and opened conformations has been described as Guo and MacKinnon . eLife 2017 ; 6 : e33660 . DOI : https : / / doi . org / 10 . 7554 / eLife . 33660 1 of 19 RESEARCH ARTICLE D G ¼ D G ð g ¼ 0 Þ(cid:0) g D A ( 1 ) where D G ( g = 0 ) is the free energy difference at zero tension , g the membrane tension and D A the in - plane cross sectional area change associated with channel opening ( Haswell et al . , 2011 ) . Thus , open state stabilization relative to closed is proportional to membrane tension and the proportional - ity constant is in - plane area expansion . That is , the sensitivity of gating with respect to membrane tension is d ð D G Þ = d ð g Þ ¼ (cid:0) D A : ( 2 ) In MscL the 20 nm 2 physical expansion determined by structural and biophysical analysis ( Perozo et al . , 2002 ; Sukharev et al . , 2001 ; Corry et al . , 2010 ) corresponds well to the tension dependence of gating estimated in the most carefully executed functional experiments ( Chiang et al . , 2004 ) . The principle of mechanosensitivity exhibited by MscL suggests a simple recipe for mechanosen - sitivity in general : couple pore opening to in - plane area expansion . But as a general solution this principle seems problematic for Piezo channels . It works well for MscL because that channel func - tions as a ‘pressure release valve’ , permitting bacterial survival in the face of osmotic shock ( Sukharev et al . , 1993 ) . The wide pore opening in MscL , associated with a conductance of approxi - mately 3 nS and complete lack of ion selectivity , naturally fits with a large in - plane area expansion and therefore high mechanosensitivity ( Sukharev et al . , 1993 ) . By contrast Piezo channels have con - ductance values around 30 pS ( 100 times smaller than MscL ) and are cation selective , characteristics that are incompatible with a wide pore ( Coste et al . , 2010 ) . Yet Piezo channels are highly mechano - sensitive ( Lewis and Grandl , 2015 ; Cox et al . , 2016 ) . Somehow nature must have separated area expansion from pore diameter . In an attempt to understand how this was accomplished we have determined a structure of the mouse Piezo1 ( mPiezo1 ) channel , which exhibits many differences in its molecular detail and global interpretation when compared to an earlier structure ( Ge et al . , 2015 ) . Based on this new structure , we propose a mechanism for understanding Piezo channel mechanosensitivity . Results Structure of mPiezo1 Using cryo - electron microscopy ( cryo - EM ) we determined a structure of mPiezo1 to an overall resolu - tion of 3 . 7 A˚ ( Figure 2 and Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) .

DOI : https : / / doi . org / 10 . 7554 / eLife . 33660 3 of 19 Research article Biophysics and Structural Biology trimeric Piezo channel is a triskelion with extended arms ( Figure 2a , c ) ; from the side , it is curved as shown ( Figure 2b , d ) . The cryo - EM map shows greatest detail near the 3 - fold center ( local resolution 3 . 2 A˚ to 3 . 6 A˚ ) and less detail near the periphery ( local resolution 5 A˚ to 6 A˚ ) ( Figure 2—figure sup - plement 1e ) . To improve the map quality , symmetry expansion was conducted with focused refine - ment using a mask covering the central hub and one of the three extended arms . The resulting map showed improvement , especially at the periphery ( local resolution 4 A ˚ to 5 A ˚ ) ( Figure 2f and Table 1 ) . A crystal structure ( PDB ID : 4RAX ) was docked into density corresponding to the C - termi - nal extracellular domain ( CED ) and the remaining model ( 26 TM helices per subunit ) was built de novo ( Figure 2—figure supplements 2 and 3 ) ( Ge et al . , 2015 ) . The refined structural model con - tains 1518 residues ( out of 2547 ) , with the N - terminal 576 residues and internal flexible loops missing . The structure’s extended arms consist of 24 helices arranged as six repeated 4 - TM structural units ( Figure 3a , b ) . Each unit is a left - handed bundle of four helices starting and ending on the intracellu - lar side . The two extracellular loops ( between the first and second , and third and fourth TM helices ) are short and long , respectively , the latter being partially ordered and containing a - helices . The six 4 - TM repeats assemble with each other also as a left - handed helix , causing the extended arms of the triskelion to spiral away from the trimer’s center , out of plane with respect to the central pore axis ( Figures 2c , d and 3b ) . Adjacent 4 - TM repeats are linked by a polypeptide chain that crosses the span of two repeats , owing to their relative orientations ( Figure 3b ) . The interactions provided by an extended connection likely aid stabilization of the extended arms . The repetitive pattern of TM helices is well conserved for all six 4 - TM units visible in the structure . Sequence analysis suggests that the pattern continues to the N - terminus ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 – 3 ) . Therefore , it is likely that a Piezo subunit contains nine 4 - TM units altogether ( the first 3 of which we do not see ) giv - ing a total of 36 TM helices , which form the arms , plus two C - terminal TM helices that meet at the center of the trimer . We have numbered helices in our structural model accordingly ( Figure 3a ) . The central hub of the trimer is formed by amino acids following TM36 ( Figure 3 and Figure 6— figure supplement 1 ) . At the center TM37 - 38 form a 3 - fold symmetric channel lined by TM38 , capped on the extracellular side by a CED , and extended on the intracellular side by a pore exten - sion ( PE ) helix ( Figure 3a and Figure 6—figure supplement 1c , d ) . TM37 - 38 are domain - swapped relative to TM1 - 36 ( Figure 2c ) . The channel is surrounded at the level of the inner membrane leaflet by a layered , helical cuff . The cuff consists of ‘elbow’ helices ( residues 2116 to 2142 ) , a ‘base’ helix ( residues 2149 to 2175 ) and ‘hairpin’ helices ( residues 2501 to 2534 ) from all three subunits ( Figure 3a and Figure 6—figure supplement 1c , d ) . This solid cuff attaches the extended arms to the channel . Piezo also contains a long intracellular helix of 66 amino acids extending from the trimer center , radially out to TM28 ( Figures 2d and 3 ) . Referred to as a ‘beam’ , this feature was observed previ - ously ( Ge et al . , 2015 ) , but modeled as two instead of one helix . In addition , linkers between 4 - TM units contain at least one helix that runs perpendicular to the TM helices and to the extended arms ( Figures 2c , 3 and 7b ) . These ‘cross’ helices are mostly hydrophobic and located inside of the micelle density , near the intracellular interface . Figure 2 continued processing in RELION .

However , the detergent micelle containing a trimer is curved into a dome shape ( Figures 2b , 4b ) . The diameter of the dome opening is about 18 nm with a depth of about 6 nm . The central cap , formed by the CED , is actually located mostly inside the dome . The angle between the central pore axis and the beam in each subunit is about 60 ˚ instead of 90 ˚ , as we would expect if the trimer were located in a fully flattened membrane ( Figures 2d , 4b , c ) . Consequently , the hydrophobic residues on the TM helices ( flanked by charged amino acids ) form a clearly curved band on the trimer surface , matching the micelle density ( Figure 4c ) . The distri - bution of charged amino acids on the extended arms of Piezo is consistent with the positive inside rule for membrane proteins ( von Heijne , 1992 ) . The unusual shape of the Piezo trimer in detergent micelles led us next to test whether such a non - planar conformation can occur inside a lipid bilayer . Figure 5a shows a Piezo channel reconsti - tuted into a small unilamellar vesicle consisting of POPE and POPG . The presence of a Piezo channel produces a local dome - shaped deformation of the membrane , with density corresponding to the CED visible inside the dome ( the channel is inserted with its extracellular side inside the vesicle ) .

We observed that vesicles consisting of POPE and POPG tended to be non - spherical even in the absence of Piezo channels , possibly due to the truncated cone and inverted , truncated cone shapes of POPG and POPE lipids , respectively ( Israelachvili , 1992 ) . To further examine the ability of Piezo to deform membrane bilayers , we also analyzed vesicles consisting of mixtures of POPC and DOPS , with and without cholesterol . Vesicles of these lipid compositions are spherical in shape ( circular in projection ) ( Figure 5b ) . As in POPE and POPG vesicles , Piezo channels deform the membrane by producing local membrane curvature ( Figure 5c and Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ) . We note that Piezo channels are almost always inserted with an inside - out orientation in vesicles so that the local Figure 3 . Topology of mPiezo1 .

These electrostatic interactions appear to stabilize the trimeric assembly in its curved conformation . Structural features and conformational state of the pore The transmembrane pore , lined by TM38 and the PE helix , is closed ( Figure 6a – c ) . At the level of the membrane inner leaflet , the pore radius at positions E2537 , P2536 and M2493 is 0 . 1 A˚ , 0 . 4 A˚ and 0 . 3 A˚ , respectively . Estimated from the size of tetraethylammonium ( TEA ) , which is permeable , Piezo should open to a radius of at least 4 A˚ ( Gnanasambandam et al . , 2015 ) . When it does open , two rings of glutamate residues flanking either side of the narrow region of the pore ( E2487 and E2537 ) likely account for cation selectivity through direct interactions with permeating ions ( Figure 6a , c ) . The overall architecture of Piezo’s pore shares several similarities with P2X ( Kawate et al . , 2009 ) and acid - sensing ion channels ( ASIC ) ( Baconguis et al . , 2014 ) ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1a , b ) . First , all three are trimeric . Second , the pores contain two TM helices and a large extracellular domain , which enclose a continuous ion - conduction path along the three - fold symmetry axis , includ - ing a central vestibule in the extracellular domain . Third , there are lateral fenestrations located Figure 5 continued bar 10 nm .

Given their distinct genetic backgrounds yet similar overall structures , it is reasonable to hypothesize that the two TM helices with an extracellular domain are the core components for a functional and efficient trimeric channel of this type . Therefore , other components unique to Piezo , including the elbow , base , hairpin , and PE helices ( Figure 3a and Figure 6—figure supplement 1c , d ) , are likely to be directly associated with mechano - transduction . These unique components are positioned in a cuff surrounding the narrowest region of the pore and therefore seem well positioned to influence gat - ing . Upon mechanical stimulus , major conformational changes are expected in these components in response to movement of the triskelion arms to open the pore . Discussion Hypothesis for mechanical gating Piezo has a central ion conduction pathway surrounded by extended arms composed of transmem - brane helices . The most strikingly unusual feature of Piezo’s structure is that it does not conform to a locally planar membrane . Instead , its extended arms project approximately 30 ˚ out of the plane defined by the pore , incompatible with a flat membrane ( Figures 2d , 4b , c ) . The extended arms are also curved so that the entire structure takes the appearance of a 3 - sided pyramid – inverted when viewed from outside the cell – that spirals from base to apex to form a semi - sphere - shaped dome ( projecting into the cell ) . Hydrophobic helices lie perpendicular to the arms like cross bars between the arms , presumably to support the curved membrane as it conforms to Piezo’s non - planar shape ( Figures 2 , 4 , 7b ) . Twelve N - terminal transmembrane helices are not resolved . These presumably extend the arms even further , however , given the curvature of the arms these N - terminal helices appear to coincide with the edge of the dome , far from the center , where the membrane becomes planar again . We note that a published low - resolution structure led the authors to conclude that Piezo resides in a locally planar membrane , with extended arms forming extra - membranous , extra - cellular blades ( Ge et al . , 2015 ) . The structure we have described is fundamentally different in that the arms , composed of transmembrane helices , are inside the membrane and force the membrane to curve , as shown in images of Piezo reconstituted into lipid vesicles ( Figure 5 and Figure 5—fig - ure supplement 1 ) . We have approximated the shape of the membrane surrounding Piezo as a dome with a spherical surface of radius 10 . 2 nm , corresponding to the mid - plane surface of a membrane 3 . 6 nm thick ( Figure 7a , b and Figure 7—figure supplement 1a ) . The shape matches closely but not perfectly the hydrophobic boundaries of Piezo , but it is sufficient for the following discussion . By appealing to the illustration of mid - plane area expansion in Figure 1 , the structure of Piezo offers a plausible explana - tion for the origin of its tension - gating . If the semi - spherical dome becomes flatter ( i . e . more co - pla - nar with the membrane ) when Piezo opens , then the channel - membrane system will expand . In MscL , widening of the channel’s diameter causes membrane plane expansion . In the proposed mechanism for Piezo , flattening of the channel and its locally surrounding membrane causes mem - brane plane expansion by transferring out - of - plane membrane area ( the dome ) into the membrane plane . In both cases weights are lowered in the ‘gravitational analog’ ( i . e . free energy is reduced ) ( Figure 1 ) . Because flattening does not constrain the pore to open wide , expansion and pore diame - ter are decoupled such that Piezo can exhibit its small conductance and cation selectivity , properties that are essential to its function , without compromising the ability to sense lateral membrane tension . In this proposed mechanism for Piezo , expansion of the membrane - channel system occurs when a curved , dome - shaped membrane becomes flatter ( more planar ) . The expanded plane area corre - sponds quantitatively to the change in area of the dome that is projected onto the membrane plane , D A proj , and the resulting energy difference is g D A proj ( Figure 7c ) . For the simplified geometry shown in Figure 7 the semi - spherical mid - plane has a total mid - plane surface area of 400 nm 2 and a pro - jected area , A proj , of 280 nm 2 ( Figure 7—figure supplement 1a ) . Therefore , if Piezo becomes completely co - planar with the membrane when it opens ( i . e . so that its projected area equals its total area ) then D A proj associated with opening would be 400 nm 2 – 280 nm 2 = 120 nm 2 . A membrane under tension g would thus favor the open conformation by energy g D A proj , corresponding to 42 Guo and MacKinnon . eLife 2017 ; 6 : e33660 .

If Piezo flattens only partially upon opening then D A proj will be less than 120 nm 2 and the energy difference correspondingly smaller ( Figure 7c , d ) . Recall that for MscL , the in - plane area change D A is ~ 20 nm 2 . This means Piezo has the potential for much higher tension sensi - tivity than MscL ( equation 2 , with D A = D A proj for Piezo ) . There are other possible origins of tension dependence in Piezo , related to changes in the size , geometry and chemistry of the protein - lipid interface associated with gating ( Wiggins and Phillips , 2005 ; Ursell et al . , 2008 ; Phillips et al . , 2012 ) . While these changes are still unknown , we suspect that the major origin of tension - depen - dent gating is the change in projected area , because it has the potential to be so large . In addition to the tension - dependent energy associated with projected area expansion , there is a separate , intrinsic energy cost to bend a membrane even in the absence of tension ( Ursell et al . , 2008 ; Helfrich , 1973 ; Deserno , 2007 ; Phillips , 2017 ) . For the semi - spherical membrane in Figure 7 we calculate the magnitude of this energy to be approximately 150 k B T , even excluding the curva - ture back into the membrane plane , which will substantially increase the bending energy further Figure 7 .

This bending energy implies that the Piezo protein must perform work on the membrane to curve it . We propose that in the absence of a membrane’s tendency toward planarity ( i . e . in a detergent micelle ) Piezo is very stable in its closed , curved conformation and we observe physical features – such as surface electrostatic interactions – that support this idea ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) . Inside a membrane Piezo produces similar membrane curvature , but this must occur at the energetic expense of its closed state stability , because some of that energy must go into curving the membrane . Then , we propose , when tension is applied to the mem - brane , the additional energy term g D A proj tips the balance , favoring the flatter , open conformation ( Figure 7d ) . A modification of the free energy equation 1 for Piezo could be written D G ¼ ð D G prot þ D G bend Þ(cid:0) g D A proj : ( 3 ) The terms D G prot and D G bend refer to free energy differences intrinsic to protein gating and mem - brane bending , respectively . In this description , for the transition from closed to open , D G prot is posi - tive ( unfavorable ) and D G bend is negative ( favorable ) : these tend to cancel each other , with D G prot somewhat greater in magnitude so that the channel is closed when g = 0 . The equation predicts that lipid membranes of differing stiffness ( i . e . different bending moduli ) should influence gating through D G bend ( i . e . stiffer membranes with a more negative D G bend should lead to channel opening at smaller values of membrane tension ) ( Figure 7d ) . That D G bend and D G prot are indeed tension - inde - pendent ( such that d ( D G ) / d g = (cid:0) D A proj ) is an assumption that needs to be tested through further measurement and analysis . We can only conjecture how changes in Piezo’s shape will open the pore . We think it is significant that a single subunit is compatible with a planar membrane , whereas the trimer is not . This is due to the abrupt angle at which the arms project from the pore ( Figures 2d , 4b , c ) : this implies that forces tending to flatten Piezo will produce the greatest stress at the region of attachment . This region coincides with the cuff of helices that surround the pore’s narrowest segment , presumably its gate . At first consideration a force directed along the triskelion arms toward the center of the trimer , asso - ciated with flattening of Piezo’s arms , might be expected to constrict the pore further . However , given that TM37 - 38 are domain - swapped relative to TM1 - 36 , such a force will more likely push the ‘swapped’ pore - lining helices away from the center and open the pore . In summary , the structure of Piezo1 leads us to propose a membrane dome mechanism for the origins of its mechanosensitive gating . In this mechanism a dome of membrane , created by Piezo’s shape in its closed conformation , undergoes relative flattening upon channel opening . This mecha - nism does not require the application of a force pressing onto the dome ( i . e . a force component nor - mal to the plane of the membrane ) : lateral membrane tension alone will favor the flatter , opened conformation by a relative energy difference given by g D A proj . Whether Piezo interacts directly with cytoskeletal or extracellular matrix proteins to modulate its mechanosensitive gating is unknown ( Lewis and Grandl , 2015 ; Gottlieb et al . , 2012 ) . The membrane dome mechanism presented here is a hypothesis inspired by the highly unusual structure of Piezo and its demonstrated ability to curve lipid bilayers into a dome . Additional experiments will be needed to test this hypothesis .

A green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) tag following a PreScission prote - ase cleavage site ( LEVLFQ / GP ) was placed at the C - terminus to facilitate detection and purification . mPiezo1 was expressed using the BacMam method ( Goehring et al . , 2014 ) . Briefly , baculoviruses carrying mPiezo1 were produced and amplified for two rounds in Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 cells ( RRID : CVCL _ 0549 ) . HEK293S GnTI - cells ( RRID : CVCL _ A785 ) in suspension culture were grown at 37 ˚ C and infected with 10 % ( v / v ) viruses at a density of ~ 3 (cid:2) 10 6 cells / ml . At 15 hr post infection , 10 mM sodium butyrate was added to induce expression at 30 ˚ C . Cells were harvested at 48 hr post - induction . mPiezo1 purification was kept at 4 ˚ C at all times . Cell pellet from 2 L of culture were resuspended in 100 ml TBS supplemented with 1 mM PMSF , 1 m g / ml pepstatin , 1 m g / ml aprotinin , 1 m g / ml leupeptin , 1 mM benzamidine , 1 mM AEBSF , and 0 . 1 mg / ml trypsin inhibitor . After sonication , the lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 9500 (cid:2) g for 15 min . The supernatant was then ultra - cen - trifuged using a Beckman Ti70 rotor at 42 , 000 rpm ( rcf ~ 181 , 000 (cid:2) g ) at 4 ˚ C for 1 . 5 hr . Membranes were collected and the pellet resuspended and homogenized in 20 ml TBS containing all protease inhibitors as described above . The membrane resuspension was mixed with 20 ml TBS containing 2 % digitonin and rotated at 4 ˚ C for 1 . 5 hr for protein extraction . Unsolubilized debris was removed by ultra - centrifugation using a Beckman Ti70 rotor at 42 , 000 rpm ( rcf ~ 181 , 000 (cid:2) g ) at 4 ˚ C for 40 min . The supernatant was incubated with GFP nanobody - coupled Sepharose resin ( Kirchhofer et al . , 2010 ) equilibrated with elution buffer ( 150 mM NaCl , 20 mM Tris pH8 , 0 . 05 % dig - itonin , protease inhibitors ) for 2 hr . After loading onto a column and collecting the flow - through , the resin was washed with 10 column volumes of wash buffer ( 300 mM NaCl , 20 mM Tris pH8 , 0 . 05 % digitonin , protease inhibitors ) . PreScission protease was added to the resin at a target protein to protease ratio of 20 : 1 ( w / w ) and incubated overnight with gentle rotation to cleave GFP . Target pro - tein was then eluted with elution buffer and concentrated to 500 m l by Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter ( MWCO 10 kDa ) . The sample was injected onto a Superose 6 Increase 10 / 300 GL column ( GE Healthcare , Little Chalfont , United Kingdom ) equilibrated with elution buffer . Peak fractions were pooled together and concentrated to 15 mg / ml . Cell lines Cell lines were acquired from and authenticated by the American Type Culture Collection ( ATCC ) . The cell lines were not tested for mycoplasma contamination . Electron microscopy sample preparation and imaging 3 mM fluorinated Fos - Choline - 8 ( FFC - 8 ) was added to freshly purified mPiezo1 sample immediately prior to freezing . Quantifoil 400 mesh gold R1 . 2 / 1 . 3 holey carbon grids were treated with 10 s of glow discharge in reduced pressure air . A first drop of 3 m l protein sample was applied on the grid , incubated for 15 s , and manually removed using a filter paper with minimum touching . Then , a sec - ond drop of 3 m l protein sample was added , incubated for 15 s , and then blotted once for 1 s with (cid:0) 1 force and plunged into liquid ethane , using a Vitrobot Mark IV ( FEI company , Hillsboro , Oregon ) operated at room temperature and 100 % humidity . The grids were then stored in liquid nitrogen until imaging . Automated data collection was controlled by SerialEM ( Mastronarde , 2005 ) on a Titan Krios transmission electron microscope ( FEI ) operating at 300 keV equipped with a K2 Summit direct elec - tron detector ( Gatan , Inc . , Pleasanton , CA ) . Micrographs were recorded in super - resolution mode , with a calibrated physical pixel size of 1 . 3 A˚ ( a super - resolution pixel size of 0 . 65 A˚ ) and a nominal defocus range of 1 . 0 to 2 . 4 m m . The exposure time for each image was 10 s fractionated over 50 frames with a dose rate of 8 electrons per physical pixel per second , corresponding to a total cumu - lative dose of of 47 electron per A˚ 2 , or 0 . 94 electron per A˚ 2 per frame . Image processing and map calculation Whole - frame motion correction was performed with gain reference applied and dose weighting using MotionCor2 ( Zheng et al . , 2017 ) . The contrast transfer function parameters were estimated for all summed images using CTFFIND4 ( Rohou and Grigorieff , 2015 ) . RELION ( Kimanius et al . , 2016 ; Scheres , 2012 ) was used for image processing except where noted otherwise . 2000 particles Guo and MacKinnon . eLife 2017 ; 6 : e33660 . DOI : https : / / doi . org / 10 . 7554 / eLife . 33660 13 of 19 Research article Biophysics and Structural Biology were manually picked from a subset of images and extracted in a box size of 400 pixels and a mask diameter of 300 A˚ . Extracted particles were subjected to 2D classification requesting 20 classes , 12 of which showed representative views and were selected as templates for automated particle pick - ing . 576 , 191 particles picked from 3414 images were then manually inspected to remove false posi - tives , resulting in 521 , 152 particles . Another round of 2D classification requesting 100 classes was used to further clean up the dataset , which then contained 459 , 918 particles . Using CryoSPARC ( Punjani et al . , 2017 ) ab initio reconstruction requesting three classes with no symmetry imposed , an initial model was generated from 232 , 799 particles . This exhibited clear three - fold symmetry . After another round of symmetry - free ab initio reconstruction in CryoSPARC to remove non - symmet - ric particles , the resultant 161 , 986 particles were reconstructed to 3 . 74 A˚ resolution according a 0 . 143 cutoff criterion on the Fourier shell correlation ( FSC ) curve , by CryoSPARC homogeneous refinement with C3 symmetry imposed . Given that the peripheral region of each arm is relatively flexible , the triskelion is not strictly C3 - symmetrical . Therefore , symmetry expansion was used to improve the peripheral resolution . The manually inspected 521 , 152 particles were first aligned in RELION 3D auto - refine with C3 symmetry using the CryoSPARC model as a reference . Using the relion _ particle _ symmetry _ expand program , each particle was then replicated and 120 ˚ or 240 ˚ was added to the first Euler angle so that each of the three arms of every particle was rotated to the same orientation on the C3 - symmetric ring . This 3 - fold enlarged dataset was then classified in C1 with a mask covering only a single protruding arm without angular search . The best class containing 277 , 548 expanded particles was subjected to masked refinement in C1 with the mask covering the central hub and one arm . Only local angular searches were carried out during this refinement so that copies of the same arm do not contribute to the reconstruction more than once . The resultant map has a resolution of 3 . 8 A˚ after post - proc - essing and allowed de novo model building for the peripheral region . Local resolution was estimated using Blocres ( Cardone et al . , 2013 ) with a kernel size of 19 . Model building and refinement The density map from masked refinement in C1 was sharpened by applying an isotropic b - factor of (cid:0) 200 A˚ 2 in RELION post - processing for model building . A crystal structure of the mPiezo1 CED ( PDB ID 4RAX ) was docked into the map using UCSF Chimera ( RRID : SCR _ 004097 ) ( Pettersen et al . , 2004 ) as a starting point . Manual building and refinement was performed in COOT ( RRID : SCR _ 014222 ) ( Emsley et al . , 2010 ) . Major helix elements were first placed into density and then con - nected by manually building the loops in baton mode . Sequence was registered by assigning the bulky side chains . The final model contains residues 577 – 600 , 605 – 717 , 782 – 875 , 880 – 886 , 892 – 1365 , 1493 – 1578 , 1655 – 1807 , 1952 – 1997 , 2015 – 2065 , 2075 – 2411 , 2424 – 2456 , 2463 – 2546 . Among them , side chains of residues 577 – 600 , 605 – 717 and 1551 – 1578 were trimmed to C b , as these densi - ties are less well - defined . In addition , a separate chain containing 16 alanine residues was modeled into density near the central bottom ; these are not connected to other parts of the map . A trimer model of the channel was generated from a monomer by applying three - fold symmetry . The trimer model was refined with phenix . real _ space _ refine ( Afonine et al . , 2013 ) using secondary structure and non - crystallographic symmetry ( NCS ) restraints . MolProbity ( RRID : SCR _ 014226 ) ( Chen et al . , 2010 ) was used to monitor the model geometry through multiple rounds of real space refinement and manual rebuilding . The refined model has a MolProbity score of 1 . 73 , a clashscore of 4 . 84 , with 0 . 25 % rotamer outliers . The Ramachandran plot contains 91 . 96 % favored , 8 . 04 % allowed , and no outliers . Structure figures were generated with Chimera , Pymol ( RRID : SCR _ 000305 , The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System , Version 1 . 8 Schro¨dinger , LLC . ) , APBS ( RRID : SCR _ 008387 ) ( Dolinsky et al . , 2004 ) and HOLE ( Smart et al . , 1996 ) . Structure calculations were performed using the SBGrid suite of pro - grams ( Morin et al . , 2013 ) . Proteoliposome reconstitution and imaging Two different lipid compositions were used for reconstitution . One contains 1 - palmitoyl - 2 - oleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphoethanolamine ( POPE ) and 1 - palmitoyl - 2 - oleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phospho - ( 1’ - rac - glyc - erol ) ( POPG ) ( Avanti Polar Lipids , Alabaster , AL ) at a 3 : 1 wt ratio . The other contains 1 - palmitoyl - 2 - oleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine ( POPC ) , 1 , 2 - dioleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phospho - L - serine ( DOPS ) Guo and MacKinnon . eLife 2017 ; 6 : e33660 .

The lipids were mixed in chloroform and washed with pentane . After drying with an argon stream , the lipids were incubated overnight in a vacuum chamber . Dried lipids were suspended by sonication in buffer containing 20 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 150 mM NaCl , and then mixed with 1 . 3 % C12E10 for 2 hr at room temperature , to make final lipid concentration 20 mg / ml . Mouse Piezo1 was purified following the same protocol as described above , except replacing digitonin with C12E10 , 2 % ( w / v ) and 0 . 025 % ( w / v ) for extraction and stabili - zation , respectively . Purified protein was added to the lipid / detergent mixture in a protein - to - lipid ratio of 1 : 20 ( w / w ) . Following 1 . 5 hr incubation at 4 ˚ C , C12E10 was removed by incubating the mix - ture with SM - 2 bio - beads ( Bio - rad , Hercules , CA ) overnight at 4 ˚ C for the POPE : POPG vesicles , and by dialyzing against detergent - free buffer for 4 days at 4 ˚ C for the POPC : DOPS : cholesterol vesicles . Generated proteoliposome vesicles were collected and briefly sonicated before freezing on C - flat 1 . 2 / 1 . 3 400 mesh Holey Carbon grids for the POPE : POPG vesicles , and Quantifoil 400 mesh gold R1 . 2 / 1 . 3 holey carbon grids for the POPC : DOPS : cholesterol vesicles . Micrographs were collected on a Talos Arctica transmission electron microscope ( FEI ) operating at 200 keV equipped with a K2 Summit direct electron detector ( Gatan ) , in super - resolution mode , with a nominal defocus range of 0 . 8 to 2 . 4 m m . The calibrated physical pixel size is 1 . 5 A˚ for the POPE : POPG vesicles , and 1 . 9 A˚ for the POPC : DOPS : cholesterol vesicles . The exposure time for each image was 10 s fractionated over 50 frames , with a dose rate of 8 electrons per physical pixel per second for the POPE : POPG vesicles , and a dose rate of 15 electrons per physical pixel per second for the POPC : DOPS : cholesterol vesicles .
