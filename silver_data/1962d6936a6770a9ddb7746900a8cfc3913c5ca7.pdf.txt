Here we estimate the effects of 35 prior infection induced immunity and children on SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in households . 36 37 Methods 38 We conducted a household cohort study between March 2020 - June 2022 in Managua , Nicaragua 39 where when one household member tests positive for SARS - CoV - 2 , household members are 40 closely monitored for SARS - CoV - 2 infection . Using a pairwise survival model , we estimate the 41 association of infection period , age , symptoms , and infection - induced immunity with secondary 42 attack risk . 43 44 Results 45 Overall transmission occurred in 72 . 4 % of households , 42 % of household contacts were infected 46 and the secondary attack risk was 13 . 0 % ( 95 % CI : 11 . 7 , 14 . 6 ) . Prior immunity did not impact the 47 probability of transmitting SARS - CoV - 2 . However , participants with pre - existing infection - 48 induced immunity were half as likely to be infected compared to naïve individuals ( RR 0 . 53 , 49 95 % CI : 0 . 39 , 0 . 72 ) , but this reduction was not observed in children . Likewise , symptomatic 50 infected individuals were more likely to transmit ( RR 24 . 4 , 95 % CI : 7 . 8 , 76 . 1 ) ; however , 51 symptom presentation was not associated with infectivity of young children . Young children 52 were less likely to transmit SARS - CoV - 2 than adults . During the omicron era , infection - induced 53 immunity remained protective against infection . 54 55 .

While young children are less infectious , prior infection and asymptomatic 58 presentation did not reduce their infectivity as was seen in adults . As SARS - CoV - 2 transitions to 59 endemicity , children may become more important in transmission dynamics . 60 61 .

[ 1 ] Thus , understanding the impact of infection - induced immunity on 65 transmission and contribution of children to SARS - CoV - 2 transmission is essential to 66 understanding how this transition will occur . 67 68 Prior transmission studies show that vaccination reduces the likelihood of transmission , [ 2 , 3 ] 69 and infection - induced immunity is associated with shorter shedding duration and lower viral 70 load ; [ 4 ] however , the effect of infection - induced immunity on SARS - CoV - 2 transmission has 71 not been well established . [ 5 ] Given the high infectivity of SARS - CoV - 2 and its emerging 72 variants , many children have already been infected worldwide . [ 6 - 9 ] . Further , as of June 2022 , 73 SARS - CoV - 2 vaccine availability and uptake has been limited for children globally . [ 10 ] 74 75 Questions persist about the contribution of children to SARS - CoV - 2 transmission . Evidence on 76 the contribution of children to transmission generally shows that children have a lower risk of 77 SARS - CoV - 2 transmission when infected compared to adults [ 11 - 13 ] while other work , 78 particularly after the emergence of SARS - CoV - 2 variants , finds that children have similar or 79 increased risk of transmission . [ 14 , 15 ] 80 81 We present results from an ongoing , community - based , household transmission study located in 82 Managua , Nicaragua from June 2020 - June 2022 .

Adults and parents / guardians of children provided written informed 89 consent and children six years or older provided verbal assent . 90 91 Participants included in this analysis are members of the ongoing Household Influenza Cohort 92 Study ( HICS ) which began in 2017 . HICS is a community - based prospective household cohort 93 study located in District II of Managua , Nicaragua . In June 2020 , the study was expanded to 94 include a transmission sub - study of SARS - CoV - 2 . Participants attend the Health Center Sócrates 95 Flores Vivas at the first signs of a fever or respiratory illness . A respiratory sample is collected 96 and tested for influenza and SARS - CoV - 2 via reverse - transcription polymerase chain reaction 97 ( PCR ) . 98 99 When a participant tests positive for SARS - CoV - 2 , household members are invited to participate 100 in the SARS - CoV - 2 transmission sub - study . A separate consent was collected for the sub - study . 101 Study staff visit the home up to six times to collect respiratory samples ( days 0 , 3 , 7 , 14 , 21 , and 102 30 ) and conduct a final follow - up visit 45 - 60 days later . Daily symptom data is collected by staff 103 during each visit . [ 16 ] 104 105 .

All 106 blood samples collected from 2020 - 2021 were tested for SARS - CoV - 2 IgG antibody to the spike 107 receptor binding domain via an enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) following a 108 protocol adapted from Mount Sinai . [ 17 ] 109 110 Prior SARS - CoV - 2 infection - induced immunity included both PCR and serologically confirmed 111 infections . We categorize SARS - CoV - 2 infections into three periods : March 2020 - February 112 2021 ( pre - variant era ) , March 2021 - December 2021 ( pre - omicron variants , predominantly 113 gamma and delta ) , and January 2022 - June 2022 ( omicron variant ) . 114 115 SARS - CoV - 2 vaccinations in the cohort began in 2021 . Most vaccinated participants received 116 their first vaccine beginning in September of 2021 . A variety of vaccines have been used , with 117 AstraZeneca , Abdala , and the Soberana 02 being the three most common vaccines administered . 118 Participants are considered fully vaccinated 14 days after the final dose . We compared age at 119 enrollment , sex , SARS CoV - 2 vaccination , and presence of SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies before 120 January 1 , 2022 , between participants who did and did not participate in intensive monitoring 121 using a chi - square and Fisher - exact tests . Using these tests , we also compared infection period , 122 sex , age , bedroom - and bed - sharing , prior infections , vaccination , and index case symptoms 123 between households that did and did not have transmission ( an observed SAR - CoV - 2 infection 124 among household members ) and ( except for symptoms ) between PCR - and PCR + household 125 contacts . 126 127 .

These models can account simultaneously for within - household 130 transmission and the risk of infection from outside the household . The SAR from these models 131 can be interpreted as the probability of transmission from one infected household member to one 132 susceptible . [ 18 , 19 ] 133 134 We assumed an incubation period of six days , a latency period of three , and a 10 - day duration of 135 infectiousness ; [ 20 - 22 ] therefore , participants were considered infectious three days before to 136 seven days following infection . Participants were considered symptomatic during their infectious 137 period if they reported symptoms within seven days following the infection date . 138 SAS version 9 . 4 ( SAS Institute Inc . ) and R version 4 . 1 . 1 with the transtat package were used to 139 conduct the analysis . [ 18 , 23 ] The models included infection period , number of household 140 members , age , sex , presence of symptoms , cough , rhinorrhea , prior SARS - CoV - 2 infection , 141 SARS - CoV - 2 vaccination , and bed - and bedroom - sharing . We also include an interaction term 142 for age with presence of symptoms , cough , rhinorrhea , and prior SARS - CoV - 2 infection . 143 144 To evaluate if the household SARs were different when considering only households infected 145 with the omicron variant , we reran the univariate models for household activation for 2020 / 2021 146 and 2022 . For sensitivity analyses , we adjusted the assumed incubation , latency , and infectious 147 periods . We also reran the univariate models including only households where all household 148 members consented to participate in the household activation and serial swabbing . 149 150 .

Within the SARS - CoV - 2 153 transmission sub - study , a total of 209 households ( 48 % of all cohort houses ) were activated 154 ( some multiple times ) with 297 total activations and 1 , 189 household contacts that consented to 155 intensive monitoring and 258 that declined participation or were not present . Participants in 156 activated households that did not participate in intensive monitoring were generally working - age 157 adults and male . They also had lower cohort participation , were more likely to have missed 158 cohort blood collections since the start of the pandemic and were less likely to have reported 159 vaccination or have documented SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies ( Table 1 , Supplemental Figure 2 ) . In 160 addition to the 297 primary cases , 494 household contacts ( 42 % ) were infected . 161 162 Over half of household activations ( n = 164 , 55 % ) occurred from March 2021 - December 2021 , a 163 period when multiple variants circulated , and delta predominated . [ 24 ] Additionally , there were 164 29 ( 10 % ) participating households in March 2020 - Febuary 2021 and 104 ( 35 % ) households in 165 January 2022 - June 2022 . Overall , transmission occurred in 72 . 4 % of households ( Figure 1 ) . 166 There were a greater proportion of primary cases that were 20 - 64 years old in households that 167 had transmission compared to those where no transmission occurred ( 52 % vs 37 % ) although the 168 overall age group distribution was not significantly different ( p - value : 0 . 0531 ) . There were no 169 differences in sex , bedroom - and bed - sharing , number of prior SARS - CoV - 2 infections , SARS - 170 CoV - 2 vaccinations , or symptoms between primary cases of households with and without 171 transmission ( Supplemental Table 1 , 2 ) . 172 173 .

The estimated 174 household SAR was smaller for larger households ( 8 . 3 % compared to 15 . 4 % for households with 175 10 + and 2 - 5 members respectively ) . Children ( ages 5 - 10 ) , and adults and adolescents ( ages 11 + ) 176 were much more likely to infect others compared to young children ( ages 0 - 4 ) ( RR of 4 . 20 ( 95 % 177 CI 1 . 55 , 11 . 35 ) and 6 . 64 ( 95 % CI : 2 . 59 , 16 . 99 ) respectively ) . In absolute terms , the difference in 178 the secondary attack rates between young children , and adults and adolescents was 11 . 9 % ( SAR 179 of 3 . 2 % vs 15 . 1 % ) . However , there was no difference in the risk of being infected by age . 180 Symptomatic infectious individuals were 24 . 37 times ( 95 % CI : 7 . 80 , 76 . 14 ) more likely to 181 transmit the virus compared to asymptomatic individuals , with an absolute difference in the 182 probability of transmission of 15 . 6 % ( SAR of 16 . 7 % vs 1 . 1 % ) . Prior SARS - CoV - 2 infection was 183 associated with protection against infection ( RR = 0 . 53 , 95 % CI : 0 . 39 , 0 . 72 ) ( Figure 2 ) . 184 185 For infected young children , we observed no difference by symptom status in the risk of 186 transmitting the virus . For both infectious children and adults and adolescents , the probability of 187 transmission was lower for asymptomatic compared to symptomatic presentation ( 14 . 5 % vs 188 1 . 1 % and 19 . 3 % vs 0 . 4 % ) . We note that prior infection was not associated with the probability of 189 transmission in all age groups . Prior infection was only associated with protection against 190 infection for adults and adolescents ( Figure 3 ) . Thus , while individuals that were previously 191 infected were less likely to be reinfected , when reinfected they were just as likely to transmit . 192 193 Consistent with the pre - Omicron era results , during the omicron variant era , the risk of 194 transmission was higher for symptomatic individuals ( RR = 14 . 77 , 95 % CI : 3 . 12 , 70 . 03 ) and did 195 not vary by vaccination , and bed - or bedroom - sharing ; additionally , risk of infection did not vary 196 .

Prior infection was still associated with protection against infection ( RR = 0 . 25 , 95 % CI : 197 0 . 11 , 0 . 56 ) . However , the risk of transmission did not vary by age as it did in the overall results . 198 The risk of transmission was lower for males compared to females ( RR = 0 . 30 , 95 % CI : 199 0 . 15 , 0 . 61 ) ( Supplemental Figure 3 , 4 ) . 200 201 To examine the effect of our assumptions on our estimates , we varied the incubation , latency , 202 and infectious parameters ( Supplemental Figure 5 ) . Overall , there were minor differences in the 203 estimated SARs ; however , our main findings held . To examine the effect of non - participation , 204 we reran models limiting to households where all members participated . The overall SAR was 205 slightly higher , but there were no differences in the direction of the association age , infection - 206 induced immunity , or any other variable ( Supplemental Figure 6 ) . 207 208 Discussion 209 We estimated the household SARS - CoV - 2 SAR for a large community - based prospective cohort 210 study in Managua , Nicaragua ; to our knowledge , this is the first study that compares the 211 association between infection - induced immunity and household SAR . We observed a decreased 212 risk of infection for adults and adolescents who had a prior SARS - CoV - 2 infection , but this was 213 not observed among children . While estimated household SARs were much lower when the 214 infectious contact was asymptomatic , this was not observed among young children . These results 215 suggest distinct immune responses to natural SARS - CoV - 2 infection between younger and older 216 participants that may impact transmission dynamics . [ 25 , 26 ] 217 218 .

When infected , individuals with and without infection - induced immunity had the 221 same probability of transmission . However , these results are not inconsistent ; decreased 222 shedding duration may have little impact on household transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 where 223 household members have repeated close contact with each other early in illness . Outside of the 224 household , decreased shedding and viral load likely leads to decrease in transmission as contact 225 with others is likely shorter and less frequent . 226 227 During the period of the spread of the omicron variant , the results were similar to the overall 228 findings , albeit with generally higher probability of transmission . Infection - induced immunity 229 was still associated with protection against infection . Surprisingly , risk of transmission did not 230 vary by age . These differences may suggest changing SARS - CoV - 2 dynamics due to the 231 omicron variant . [ 15 , 27 ] 232 233 While a reduction in SARS - CoV - 2 transmission for pre or asymptomatic compared to 234 symptomatic infectious individuals has been previously noted [ 14 , 28 ] and SARS - CoV - 2 235 transmission from children compared to adults is less common [ 28 , 29 ] , we show that the 236 presence of symptoms in young children is not associated with infectiousness . Thus , the 237 increased likelihood of asymptomatic presentation of children infected with SARS - CoV - 2 does 238 not account for the differences in infectiousness between adults and children .

[ 14 , 30 ] However , studies that 243 used estimates from primarily binomial models before and after the emergence of the omicron 244 variant estimated a higher household SAR across settings ; [ 2 , 28 , 31 ] while many factors may 245 explain this difference , the use of binomial models rather than statistical transmission models 246 likely bias the estimated SAR upwards . A prior study showed that these biased estimates cannot 247 be interpreted as the probability of transmission , and instead statistical transmission models 248 should be used . [ 18 ] 249 250 Our study has several strengths and limitations . Strengths include close monitoring of 251 participants inside of an ongoing cohort , which allows us to know infection histories prior to 252 SARS - CoV - 2 entering the household as well as detect mild and asymptomatic infections . Our 253 study is also large and spans both pre - variant and variant eras . One limitation of our study is that 254 although PCR testing occurred frequently during monitoring , it is possible that SARS - CoV - 2 255 infections were missed and thus we may underestimate the household SAR . Second , not all 256 household members participated in intensive monitoring and those that declined or were not 257 available for intensive monitoring were different from those that did participate ; although the 258 proportion with detectable SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies was lower among those did not participate in 259 activation , they on average had fewer blood samples collected . The exclusion of these 260 participants likely leads to an underestimation of the household SAR ; however , when analyzing 261 only households where all participants consented to intensive monitoring , the probability of 262 transmission was only slightly larger . Statistical power was also limited in our analysis of the 263 .

We also note that these results are from a community where most were 264 infected with SARS - CoV - 2 prior to the availability of SARS - CoV - 2 vaccines . [ 24 ] Although 265 adults in other settings may have been vaccinated before their first SARS - CoV - 2 infection , most 266 children have not been . [ 6 - 9 ] However , both infection then vaccination and vaccination then 267 infection produces broad , hybrid immunity to SARS - CoV - 2 with no observed differences by 268 sequence . [ 32 - 35 ] 269 270 Our study highlights the differences in SARS - CoV - 2 transmission between children and 271 adolescents and adults which may impact transmission dynamics and the transition to 272 endemicity . Infection - induced immunity is associated with protection against infection , even in 273 the omicron variant era , but previously infected individuals were just as likely to transmit as 274 those that had not been previously infection . At the beginning of the SARS - CoV - 2 pandemic , it 275 was established that the contribution of children to SARS - CoV - 2 transmission was minor [ 13 ] . 276 The absence of protection against infection from infection - induced immunity among children 277 and the changing transmission dynamics from emerging SARS - CoV - 2 variants suggests that 278 children may already have more meaningful contributions to SARS - CoV - 2 transmission ; this 279 contribution may further increase as new children are born without immunity to SARS - CoV - 2 280 and increasingly represent the greatest proportion of primary cases .
