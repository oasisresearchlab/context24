Histochem Cell Biol ( 2008 ) 129 : 267 – 276 DOI 10 . 1007 / s00418 - 007 - 0376 - 5 123 REVIEW Clathrin - independent endocytosis : from nonexisting to an extreme degree of complexity Kirsten Sandvig · Maria Lyngaas Torgersen · Hilde Andersen Raa · Bo van Deurs Accepted : 24 December 2007 / Published online : 12 January 2008 © Springer - Verlag 2008 Abstract Today it is generally accepted that there are several endocytic mechanisms , both the clathrin - dependent one and mechanisms which operate without clathrin and with di V erent requirements when it comes to dynamin , small GTP - binding proteins of the Rho family and speci W c lipids . It should be noted that clathrin - independent endocy - tosis can occur even when the cholesterol level in the mem - brane has been reduced to so low levels that caveolae are gone and clathrin - coated membrane areas are X at . Although new investigators in the W eld take it for granted that there is a multitude of entry mechanisms , it has taken a long time for this to become accepted . However , more work needs to be done , because one can still ask the question : How many endocytic mechanisms does a cell have , what are their func - tion , and how are they regulated ? This article describes some of the history of endocytosis research and attempts to give an overview of the complexity of the mechanisms and their regulation . Keywords Endocytosis · Rho proteins · Caveolae · Flotillin · Ricin · Shiga toxin · Cholera toxin Introduction The existence of di V erent endocytic mechanisms is becom - ing of increasing interest , for instance in relation to growth and di V erentiation , cell adhesion , regulation of the activity of signalling receptors , drug delivery , and entry of patho - gens . The most well - studied endocytic mechanism involves clathrin - coated pits and vesicles , and impressive amounts of details are now known about clathrin - dependent endocy - tosis ( Schmid and McMahon 2007 ; Benmerah and Lamaze 2007 ; Ungewickell and Hinrichsen 2007 ) . Initially , the idea was that the formation of the clathrin basket was the driving force during membrane internalization , and quantitative studies suggested that the pathway could account for every - thing endocytosed ( Doxsey et al . 1987 ) . With basic ideas such as “biology is simple” and questions like , “how can a vesicle form without clathrin ? ” , it was di Y cult and it took time to get acceptance for the existence of alternative endo - cytic pathways ( Montesano et al . 1982 ; Sandvig et al . 1985 , 1987 ; Moya et al . 1985 ; Payne et al . 1988 ; Sandvig and van Deurs 1991 , 1994 ; Damke et al . 1995 ) . Clathrin - dependent endocytosis can be inhibited both by removing clathrin from the plasma membrane by a treatment involving hypo - tonic shock and depletion of cytosolic potassium ( Larkin et al . 1983 ) , and by “freezing” the clathrin coat at the sur - face by acidi W cation of the cytosol ( Sandvig et al . 1987 , 1988 ) . The W nding that endocytosis of for instance the pro - tein toxin ricin continued under both conditions , suggesting that clathrin - independent endocytosis was responsible for this uptake , was apparently di Y cult to accept for a number of investigators during a 10 year period ( 1985 – 1995 ) . New techniques in molecular biology have been crucial for the elucidation of endocytic processes , and when in 1995 it was published that the dynamin - mutant K44A inhibited clathrin - mediated endocytosis and that the cells still K .

Not only did clathrin - independent endocytosis exist , it could also be regulated ( Damke et al . 1995 ) . We now know that a number of signalling pathways can regu - late clathrin - independent endocytosis ( for review , see Sandvig and van Deurs 2005 ; Marsh and Helenius 2006 ; Mayor and Pagano 2007 ) . Despite accumulating evidence for several endocytic mechanisms , partly obtained by studies of toxins and viruses ( Marsh and Helenius 2006 ; Sandvig and van Deurs 2002 ) , many text - books in cell biology still operate with only two endocytic mechanisms , uptake from clathrin - coated pits and caveolae . The aim of this brief review is to outline the extreme complexity of clath - rin - independent endocytosis as it appears today . Clathrin - independent endocytosis : expansion of the W eld The number of clathrin - independent endocytic pathways revealed has been increasing with time . Mayor and Pagano ( Mayor and Pagano 2007 ) recently subdivided the di V erent mechanisms into four types : RhoA - regulated , cdc42 - regu - lated , and Arf6 - dependent mechanisms , and caveolar uptake . Of these , the RhoA - regulated mechanism and caveo - lar endocytosis also require the GTP - binding protein dyna - min ( Fig . 1a ) . However , there are already reports of mechanisms that may not necessarily W t into any of these four categories . For instance , clathrin - independent internal - ization of proteoglycans seems to depend not only on dyn - amin , but also on X otillin ( Payne et al . 2007 ) , and internalization of Herpes Simplex Virus Protein VP22 is independent of clathrin , but dependent on dynamin and Arf6 ( Nishi and Saigo 2007 ) . Also , studies of virus and toxin uptake indicate that there could be even more mecha - nisms ( Marsh and Helenius 2006 ; Sandvig 2001 ; Sandvig and van Deurs 2005 ) . Since cells may compensate for loss of one endocytic pathway by upregulating another ( Damke et al . 1995 ) , one can of course also question to which extent interfering with the endocytic machinery of physiologically relevant pathways in di V erent ways , might create new path - ways or cause upregulation of those normally playing only a minor role . Today , more speci W c methods such as RNA interference ( RNAi ) are used to interfere with a given pro - cess . However , also RNAi - mediated removal of a given molecule can induce upregulation of related molecules ( Utskarpen et al . 2006 ) . Moreover , upon removal of a membrane - associated molecule one may ask : To which extent do we actually know that the endocytic process is blocked ? Could the rest of the machinery allow uptake to continue with di V erent kinetics and be interpreted as a “new mechanism” ? Similarly , an old objection to the notion that removal of clathrin by potassium - depletion ( Larkin et al . 1983 ; Moya et al . 1985 ; Madshus et al . 1987 ; Sandvig et al . 1985 ) revealed endocytosis normally operating in parallel to the clathrin - dependent pathway , was that the rest of the endocytic machinery originally belonging to the clathrin - dependent machinery was still operating . A similar critical attitude should be applied on today’s interpretations . Importantly , both toxins and viruses can modify endocytic events , in some instances by inducing signalling , even though they may bind to glycolipid receptors ( Marsh and Helenius 2006 ; Lauvrak et al . 2006 ; Römer et al . 2007 ) . Internalization of membrane components and ligands by endocytosis thus have di V erent requirements when it comes to dependency of dynamin , caveolin , X otillin , and small GTPases , and in addition , cholesterol and other speci W c lipids play a role ( see below ) . To which extent the di V erent endocytic mechanisms vary depending on cell type , growth conditions and the extent of cell polarization is to a large extent not known , and has to be addressed in future studies . It should be stressed that most of our knowledge about clathrin - independent endocytic mechanisms derives from cells in culture . The work of combining di V erent results into clearly de W - ned models is far from W nished . In 2005 it was published Fig . 1 An overview of a factors involved in di V erent types of endocy - tosis , and b schematic drawing of polarized MDCK cells where some proteins / enzymes involved in regulation of apical clathrin - independent endocytosis have been listed . It should be noted that apical clathrin - independent endocytosis may consist of more than one mechanism and that polarized MDCK cells have caveolae only at the basolateral sur - face . For references , see the text Histochem Cell Biol ( 2008 ) 129 : 267 – 276 269 123 that CtBP3 / BARS drives membrane W ssion in processes where dynamin is not involved ( Bonazzi et al . 2005 ) . Inter - fering with the action of this protein reduces X uid phase uptake , as previously reported for cdc42 - dependent uptake ( Mayor and Pagano 2007 ) . However , whether cdc42 and CtBP3 / BARS a V ect the same process does not seem to be known . The possibility exists that CtBP3 / BARS might indirectly a V ect endocytosis ( Mayor and Pagano 2007 ) . Furthermore , when inhibiting endocytic uptake of a ligand , it can be di Y cult to measure whether it is movement of the ligand into the membrane invagination giving rise to the endocytic vesicle that is reduced or whether it is the forma - tion of the vesicle that is the step a V ected . To classify the di V erent mechanisms properly , more information is required ( see Fig . 1a , b ) . It is important to note that polarized cells have a di V erential regulation of clathrin - independent endocytosis at the two poles , and regulators of apical clathrin - independent endocytosis have been indicated in Fig . 1b ( separate chapter below ) . Interestingly , caveolae are only present on the basolateral side in the polarized epithe - lial cell line MDCK ( Verkade et al . 2000 ; Vogel et al . 1998 ) . In the following sections we will describe various aspects of the clathrin - independent mechanisms in more detail . Membrane lipids required for clathrin - independent endocytosis In addition to a large number of proteins , also membrane lipids are important for clathrin - independent endocytosis . Interfering with sphingolipid synthesis may a V ect di V erent types of clathrin - independent endocytosis by mechanisms poorly understood ( Cheng et al . 2006 ) . Importantly , sphin - gomyelin seems to be required both for recruitment of RhoA and cdc42 to the membrane and for endocytosis involving these GTP - binding proteins ( Cheng et al . 2006 ) . Cdc42 - dependent uptake is independent not only of RhoA , but also of Rac , clearly separating it from macropinocytosis which requires Rac activity ( for review , see ( Hanzal - Bayer and Hancock 2007 ; Chadda et al . 2007 ) . Interestingly , sphingolipid synthesis , or rather the production of glycos - phingolipids was found to be required for transport of cave - olin to the plasma membrane and for caveolae formation ( Cheng et al . 2006 ) . A change in the fatty acid composition of membrane lipids can also be expected to change the properties of the membrane and its interaction with cytosolic proteins of importance for endocytosis . It was recently found that incu - bation of cells with unsaturated fatty acids a V ect the uptake of the glycolipid - binding Shiga toxin which is internalized both by clathrin - dependent and clathrin - independent endo - cytosis ( Spilsberg et al . 2007 ) . A possible explanation for this W nding is that there is a change in the amount and / or size of rafts or their ability to become associated with the endocytic machinery . Lipid rafts play a central role in membrane structure and function ( Rajendran and Simons 2005 ) , and it is therefore not surprising that the fatty acid composition may a V ect endocytosis . Raft - dependent uptake have recently been reviewed ( Marsh and Helenius 2006 ; Lajoie and Nabi 2007 ; Hanzal - Bayer and Hancock 2007 ) . One can often see the generalized statement : clathrin - independent endocytosis is cholesterol - dependent ( Hanzal - Bayer and Hancock 2007 ) . This is true for processes such as macropinocytosis ( Grimmer et al . 2002 ) , uptake from caveolae , Rho - dependent uptake of IL2 ( a recent review has been written by Lajoie and Nabi 2007 ) , and cdc42 - dependent endocytosis where it was reported that there is a cholesterol - dependent activation of cdc42 which in turn mediates actin polymerization required for endocytosis via this pathway ( Chadda et al . 2007 ) . However , a normal con - centration of cholesterol does not seem to be required for uptake of all ligands taken in by clathrin - independent endo - cytosis ( Rodal et al . 1999 ) . When enough cholesterol has been extracted from the plasma membrane for the caveolae to disappear and the clathrin - coated pits to X atten , endocy - tosis of the plant toxin ricin still occurs ( Rodal et al . 1999 ) . Furthermore , when Cholera toxin uptake into HeLa cells is reduced by expression of the dynamin - mutant K44A or by induction of antisense to clathrin heavy chain in BHK cells , endocytosis of this toxin can be increased by extraction of cholesterol with methyl - (cid:1) - cyclodextrin ( Sandvig et al . 2004 ) . Similarly , uptake of Shiga toxin is increased by treatment with methyl - (cid:1) - cyclodextrin after block of clath - rin - dependent uptake by induced expression of antisense to clathrin heavy chain in BHK cells ( Fig . 2 ) . One possible explanation is that these toxins are retained at the cell sur - face by being associated with rafts , and that release from these structures by treatment with methyl - (cid:1) - cyclodextrin actually permits endocytosis of the toxins . Also , uptake of proteoglycan - binding ligands , reported to be clathrin - and caveolin - independent , but dynamin - and X otillin - depen - dent , were una V ected by W lipin and nystatin , drugs known to disrupt lipid rafts ( Payne et al . 2007 ) . It should be noted that cholesterol - depletion can inhibit the formation of invaginated clathrin - coated pits by a so far unknown pro - cess ( Rodal et al . 1999 ; Subtil et al . 1999 ) , and cholesterol - dependency is therefore not necessarily a tool to easily dis - tinguish between endocytic processes . Role of actin in endocytosis Recruitment of actin to clathrin - coated pits and subsequent actin - driven formation and internalization of endocytic vesicles and the appearance of actin “comet tails” on such 270 Histochem Cell Biol ( 2008 ) 129 : 267 – 276 123 vesicles is well - established and appears to be a highly com - plex process involving several protein systems ( McPherson 2002 ; Kaksonen et al . 2005 , 2006 ; Smythe and Ayscough 2006 ) . Interestingly , a crucial role of actin in clathrin - inde - pendent endocytosis is now becoming evident as well ( Kaksonen et al . 2006 ; Yarar et al . 2007 ; Lanzetti 2007 ) , and it seems likely that actin will turn out to be involved in all clathrin - independent endocytic mechanisms . However , in some cases actin might function to facilitate the process and not be strictly required . It has for instance been reported that there is a di V erence between cells growing in monolayers and cells in suspension when it comes to actin requirement for clathrin - dependent endocytosis ( Fujimoto et al . 2000 ) . One of the most studied examples of a clathrin - independent endocytic mechanism that is based on actin polymerization , is macropinocytosis ( see below ) , a major X uid - phase uptake pathway . Macropinocytosis An increasing complexity of the formation of macropino - somes is becoming evident . Thus , it has long been known that GTP - bound Rac stimulates accumulation of actin W la - ments at the plasma membrane and that it is involved in plasma membrane ru Z ing induced by growth factors ( Ridley et al . 1992 ) ( Fig . 1a ) . Rac in turn activates the Arp2 / 3 protein complex and WAVE , a process involved in ru Z ing ( Gao et al . 2007 ) . In addition to Rac , also Ras , Src and phosphoinositide ( PI ) 3 - kinase promote macropinocy - tosis ( Gao et al . 2007 ) , and a role of N - WASP and the sort - ing nexin 9 ( SNX9 ) in assembly and organization of actin during ru Z e formation and macropinocytosis has recently been shown ( Yarar et al . 2007 ) . Also , histone deacetylase 6 ( HDAC6 ) is associated with plasma membrane ru Z es and formation of macropinosomes upon stimulation with growth factors , processes that were inhibited in HDAC6 - de W cient cells . Interestingly , a substrate of HDAC6 , the heat shock protein Hsp90 , seemed to be involved in ru Z ing and macropinocytosis as well ( Gao et al . 2007 ) . Moreover , a clathrin - independent process reminiscent of macropino - cytosis has recently been reported ( Orth et al . 2006 ) . Here , actin - dependent circular dorsal ru Z es or dorsal membrane waves are formed upon growth factor stimulation , leading to signi W cant receptor internalization . Like in ordinary macropinocytosis , PI 3 - kinase is involved , but interest - ingly , also dynamin , which is a part of the actin - polymeriz - ing Arp2 / 3 - N - WASP - cortactin system and a large number of other proteins are required for this internalization mecha - nism ( Orth et al . 2006 ; Orth and McNiven 2006 ; McNiven 2006 ) . RhoA - , cdc42 - and CTBP3 / BARS - dependent uptake The RhoA - dependent uptake of IL - 2 receptors , (cid:2) c - cytokine receptor and IgE receptor is a dynamin - dependent process ( Mayor and Pagano 2007 ) ( Fig . 1 ) . Whether RhoA is required for the correct sorting of ligand or whether it is involved in the endocytic process as such is however being discussed ( Mayor and Pagano 2007 ) . Data from polarized cells showing that ricin uptake and X uid phase endocytosis at the apical side of polarized MDCK cells are also depen - dent on RhoA ( Garred et al . 2001 ) , suggest that it is the endocytic mechanism itself that is RhoA - dependent . A cdc42 - regulated process , which operates indepen - dently of dynamin , has been reported to be involved in uptake of glycosylphosphatidylinositol ( GPI ) - anchored proteins as well as being responsible for a major fraction of X uid - phase uptake in the cell ( Kalia et al . 2006 ) . GPI - anchored proteins were found to be internalized into CHO cells by a cdc42 - dependent , but Arf6 - independent mecha - nism . The internalized membrane ended up in vesicles without EEA1 , Rab4 , or Rab5 , but these vesicles were found to fuse with normal endosomal compartments via a Rab5 / PI3 - kinase dependent machinery . That a GPI - anchored protein and its ligand can enter independently of caveolae and dynamin and reach an acidic compartment , was W rst shown in studies of a GPI - anchored diphtheria Fig . 2 Shiga toxin endocytosis is strongly increased upon methyl - (cid:1) - cyclodextrin - treatment of BHK cells induced for expression of anti - sense to clathrin heavy chain . BHK cells with inducible expression of antisense to clathrin heavy chain was preincubated with methyl - (cid:1) - cyclodextrin ( 10 mM ) for 30 min . Then biotin - and TAG - labeled Shi - ga toxin ( 25 ng / ml ) was added and the cells were incubated for 20 min . Surface - bound and endocytosed Shiga toxin was quanti W ed as previ - ously described for Cholera toxin ( Torgersen et al . 2001 ) . The data are presented as internalized toxin as percent of total cell - associated toxin ( mean § SD , n = 4 ) . Endocytosis of transferrin was performed in par - allel to verify the inhibition of clathrin - dependent endocytosis upon induction of antisense to clathrin heavy chain . Upon induction , trans - ferrin uptake was reduced by 95 % Histochem Cell Biol ( 2008 ) 129 : 267 – 276 271 123 toxin receptor ( Skretting et al . 1999 ) . The W nding that diphtheria toxin bound to this GPI - linked receptor intoxi - cates cells , demonstrates that the toxin has been transferred to an acidic compartment facilitating low pH - induced con - formational change of diphtheria toxin and translocation of the toxin to the cytosol . The W nding that the cdc42 - dependent mechanism is responsible for most X uid uptake ( Kalia et al . 2006 ) is sur - prising , considering all the other uptake mechanisms now reported , not least macropinocytosis . It was recently shown that cdc42 is associated with the recycling endosome and that also Par proteins play a role in the endocytic process ( Balklava et al . 2007 ) . To which extent there is an indirect e V ect on the uptake from the plasma membrane when mutants of cdc42 are studied , is not quite clear . Also , as mentioned earlier , since CtBP3 / BARS is involved in dyn - amin - independent endocytosis ( Bonazzi et al . 2005 ) , and also endocytosis regulated by this protein can account for a considerable amount of X uid phase uptake , it should be elu - cidated to which extent cdc42 and CtBP3 / BARS regulated processes are related . Arf6 - dependent uptake ADP - ribosylation factor 6 ( Arf6 ) has been identi W ed as a key regulator of a clathrin - and dynamin - independent endo - cytic pathway mainly studied in HeLa and COS - 7 cells , and responsible for uptake and recycling of a collection of inte - gral plasma membrane proteins devoid of conventional endocytic signals ( see below ) . The number of cargo pro - teins reported to be internalized by Arf6 - regulated endocy - tosis in these cells is increasing and includes the plasma membrane proteins Major Histocompatibility Complex Class I ( MHCI ) and interleukin - 2 receptor (cid:3) - subunit / Tac ( Radhakrishna and Donaldson 1997 ) , (cid:1) 1 - integrin ( Brown et al . 2001 ) , M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor ( Dela - ney et al . 2002 ) and certain GPI - anchored proteins , such as CD59 ( Naslavsky et al . 2004 ) . Internalized cargo can recy - cle to the plasma membrane via the tubular Arf6 - positive recycling compartment ( Radhakrishna and Donaldson 1997 ) or , alternatively , be delivered to Rab5 and EEA1 positive early endosomes for further transport to late endo - somes and lysosomes for degradation ( Naslavsky et al . 2003 ) . Recently , rafts were reported to be recycled by an Arf6 - dependent process ( Balasubramanian et al . 2007 ) . Interestingly , the Herpes Simplex Virus protein VP22 was in CHO - K1 and HeLa cells shown to be endocytosed by a mechanism dependent on Arf6 , dynamin and lipid rafts , but independent of Rho - GTPases ( Nishi and Saigo 2007 ) . A new class of tra Y cking motifs in non - clathrin - depen - dent cargo proteins have been identi W ed and suggested to prevent internalization and / or facilitate recycling of pro - teins carrying these , via the Arf6 - regulated pathway by enhancing their association with the Arf6 - speci W c guanine nucleotide exchange factor EFA6 ( Gong et al . 2007 ) . In certain cell types , rather than de W ning a separate endocytic pathway , Arf6 regulates clathrin - dependent uptake . In Hek293 cells , for example , Arf6 regulates uptake of several G - protein coupled receptors by clathrin - dependent endocy - tosis ( Houndolo et al . 2005 ) , and there is also evidence for complex formation between Arf6 , the (cid:1) - subunit of AP2 and the heavy chain of clathrin ( Poupart et al . 2007 ) . The data furthermore suggest that Arf6 regulates the angiotensin AA type 1 receptor by recruiting AP2 and clathrin . Arf6 has also in HeLa cells been proposed to have a direct function in clathrin coat recruitment to the plasma membrane . In fact , Arf6 - GTP has recently been demonstrated to interact with AP - 2 both in vitro and in vivo , and a clathrin - interact - ing Arf6 - speci W c GTPase activating protein ( called SMAP ) , a V ecting clathrin - dependent endocytosis only , has also been identi W ed ( Paleotti et al . 2005 ; Tanabe et al . 2005 ) . Interestingly , in polarized MDCK cells , Arf6 associ - ated with the guanine nucleotide exchange factor ARNO regulates endocytosis exclusively at the apical surface by recruiting actin to clathrin - coated pits ( Hyman et al . 2006 ) . The present picture is complicated as many of the roles ascribed to Arf6 within the endocytic system seem to be not only cell type dependent , but also determined by the exchange factor associated with Arf6 ( Kalia et al . 2006 ) . The Arf6 GTP exchange factor ARNO has previously been shown to be dependent on inositol - lipids for its membrane recruitment . However , the process seems to be even more complex as small G proteins of the Arl 4 family can func - tion in recruitment of the Arf6 GEF cytohesin to the plasma membrane ( Hofmann et al . 2007 ) . Perhaps this might explain some of the apparent di V erences between cell types . Caveolae and endocytosis Caveolae are characteristic , small ( 50 – 100 nm ) , regular invaginations of the plasma membrane as seen in the EM ( Fig . 3 ) . Since caveolae have this distinct , easily recogniz - able ultrastructural morphology , they have been of particu - lar interest in relation to clathrin - independent endocytosis . The distinct shape of caveolae early led to the assumption that caveolae were endocytic structures comparable to clathrin - coated pits and vesicles . Also , in thin sections for EM which are not cut perpendicular to the plasma mem - brane , one might get the impression of several free , i . e . not surface - connected , caveolar pro W les , supporting the idea of caveolar endocytosis and a front of internalized caveolae moving into the cell ( Fig . 3 ) . Interestingly , more careful EM examination—for instance using Ruthenium Red as a surface marker—reveal that most if not all such vesicular 272 Histochem Cell Biol ( 2008 ) 129 : 267 – 276 123 pro W les are indeed surface - connected caveolae ( Fig . 4 ) . Also , the observation that e . g . Cholera toxin localized to caveolae supported the idea that caveolae were responsible for the endocytic uptake of Cholera toxin , a notion that is certainly an oversimpli W cation ( Torgersen et al . 2001 ; Shogomori and Futerman 2001 ; Nichols et al . 2001 ; see discussion in Hommelgaard et al . 2005 ; see also Kirkham et al . 2005 ) . However , X uorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) analysis of cells expressing GFP - caveolin revealed that caveolae under normal conditions are not involved in endocytosis to any signi W cant degree ( Thomsen et al . 2002 ) . Similarly , more recently live cell imaging of cells expressing GFP - caveolin showed that even high concentra - tions of EGF , which had been reported to lead to internali - zation of the EGFR via caveolae ( Sigismund et al . 2005 ) , do not mobilize caveolae above a low background level ( Kazazic et al . 2006 ) . Also , in a careful EM study where the setup allowed to discriminate between caveolin - associated and other vesicles as well as between surface - connected and free vesicles , Kirkham et al . ( 2005 ) showed that only about 2 % of caveolae bud from the plasma membrane per minute . For comparison , it takes 50 – 150 s for a clathrin - coated pit to assemble and pinch o V to form a free , clathrin - coated vesicle ( Ungewickell and Hinrichsen 2007 ) . This means that the entire population of coated pits present at a given time point will have been internalized within approxi - mately 1 – 2 . 5 min . Thus , today it appears well - established and generally accepted that under normal , non - stimulating conditions , caveolae are quite stable structures at the plasma membrane that are not involved in endocytosis to any signi W cant degree ( van Deurs et al . 2003 ; Pelkmans et al . 2004 ; Hommelgaard et al . 2005 ; Parton et al . 2006 ; Kirkham et al . 2005 ; Lajoie and Nabi 2007 ) . On the other hand , it is also evident from the above men - tioned studies that a few caveolae may pinch o V from the plasma membrane ( Thomsen et al . 2002 ; Kirkham et al . 2005 ) . This could simply be due to a basal turnover of cav - eolae at the plasma membrane . Normally , caveolae seem to be stabilized at , or anchored to , the plasma membrane by actin W laments ( Stahlhut and van Deurs 2000 ; Hommelg - aard et al . 2005 ; Thomsen et al . 2002 ; Pelkmans et al . 2002 ) . The phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid stimulates caveolar clustering and internalization in an actin - depen - dent manner ( Parton et al . 1994 ; Thomsen et al . 2002 ) . One could therefore also imagine that caveolae might be Fig . 3 Appearance of caveolae in myoepithelial cells . In ( a ) is seen a single caveola ( Cav ) and for comparison a clathrin - coated pit ( Cp ) . b shows a group of cav - eolae at the plasma membrane ; as the section is largely perpen - dicular to the membrane , most of the caveolae are clearly seen to be surface - connected . In ( c ) is shown an example of a section which is not perpendicular to the plasma membrane , and here many of the caveolae appears as free ( not surface - connected ) ves - icles . If such “free” vesicles should be unequivocally estab - lished as caveolae , they can be immunogold - labeled using an antibody against caveolin , as shown on the ultracryosection in ( d ) ( Cav ) . An unlabeled , Cp is also seen . Bars 500 nm Histochem Cell Biol ( 2008 ) 129 : 267 – 276 273 123 involved in a very slow , regulated endocytic uptake which under certain circumstances can be speeded up , for instance by controlled reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton . However , this remains speculative . Interestingly , it was recently reported that coassembly of X otillin - 1 and - 2 induced membrane curvature and forma - tion of membrane invaginations morphologically similar to caveolae but di V erent from these by not containing caveo - lin , the major caveolar protein . These X otillin - positive but caveolin - negative structures became internalized in con - trast to “classical” caveolae ( Frick et al . 2007 ) . Caveolae perform short range “kiss - and - run” motility very close to the plasma membrane . The process most likely involves continuous internalization and recycling of caveolae immediately beneath the plasma membrane ( prob - ably in the narrow 100 – 200 nm zone between the plasma membrane and the stabilizing actin cytoskeleton ) ( Thomsen et al . 2002 , Fig . 5 , online movie ; Pelkmans and Zerial 2005 ) . The signi W cance of this process is unclear but it may explain the widely accepted role of caveolae in endothelial transcytosis . Thus , since endothelial cells are often very X at ( 100 – 200 nm ) , caveolae that have pinched o V from e . g . the luminal endothelial plasma membrane , could fuse immedi - ately after with the ablumenal plasma membrane or , in cases where the endothelial cell is very X at , the fusion may take place even before the pinching has been completed , and temporary transendothelial channels may arise ( van Deurs et al . 2003 ) . When SV40 virus is added to cells , the virus particles are trapped in caveolae which subsequently become interna - lized by a process which requires tyrosine phosphorylation , reorganization of the cortical actin cytoskeleton , and recruitment of dynamin ( Pelkmans et al . 2001 , 2002 ) . Char - acteristically , the caveolar internalization is a single wave phenomenon and it takes hours before caveolin / caveolae reappear at the plasma membrane . More recently , it was shown that SV40 virus is actually internalized much more e Y ciently by a caveolin - independent mechanism ( Damm et al . 2005 ) . In any case it is questionable whether the downregulation of plasma membrane caveolae induced by SV40 virus represents any normally occurring , inducible clathrin - independent endocytic mechanism . Rather , it might re X ect clearance of the plasma membrane for caveo - lae occupied by cross - linked or aggregated receptors or Fig . 4 Caveolae are surface - connected structures . a – d show W lter - grown MDCK cells post - W xed with the electron - dense cell surface marker Ruthenium Red from the basolateral side . In ( a ) is seen a number of caveolae connected to the basolateral membrane ( arrowheads ) . Also note that three caveolae ( arrows ) are connected to the plasma membrane ( open arrow ) via a larger membrane invagination ( asterisk ) . b – d show clusters of caveolae ( arrows ) associated with elongated “vacuolar” struc - tures ( asterisks ) apparently free - ly localized in the cytoplasm . However , the labelling with Ruthenium Red clearly demon - strates that these structure are in - deed connected to the basolateral membrane , as re - vealed in ( a ) . En , early and later endosomes ; Nu , nucleus . Bar 500 nm 274 Histochem Cell Biol ( 2008 ) 129 : 267 – 276 123 ligands . Such downregulation of caveolae stimulated by receptor cross - linking is discussed in more detail elsewhere ( see Hommelgaard et al . 2005 ) . In this context , it is important to consider the many non - endocytic functions that have been associated with plasma membrane caveolae ( see van Deurs et al . 2003 ) . Thus , endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( eNOS ) is associated with caveolin - 1 , and caveolae play an important role in NO sig - naling , and are also involved in e . g . calcium signalling ( Murata et al . 2007 ) . Moreover , caveolae is important for cholesterol transport and homeostasis in adipocytes , and it was recently found that cholesterol - induced transport of caveolin to lipid droplets requires dynamin and PKC and very likely involves caveolar endocytosis ( Le et al . 2006 ) . Therefore , rather than considering caveolae in general as structures specialized for clathrin - independent endocytosis , they should be considered multifunctional membrane domains with physiological roles depending on cell type and situation ( van Deurs et al . 2003 ) . In addition , a recent report suggests that caveolins may even regulate cell func - tion independently of caveolae ( Head and Insel 2007 ) . Regulation of endocytosis in polarized epithelial cells Studies of endocytic mechanisms in cell lines do not neces - sarily re X ect the uptake mechanisms operating in vivo . Both cell density , cell adhesion and polarization can be reg - ulators of endocytosis ( del Pozo and Schwartz 2007 ; Sand - vig 1978 ; Sandvig and van Deurs 2005 ; Eker et al . 1994 ; Holm et al . 1995 ; Llorente et al . 2000 ; Sandvig et al . 2000 ; Llorente et al . 1996 ) . An early argument against clathrin - independent endocytosis was , not unexpectedly , that this could be a process occurring only in unpolarized cell lines grown on plastic support . However , investigations of polar - ized cells , such as MDCK I cells grown on W lters , revealed that clathrin - independent endocytosis contributed to the endocytic uptake both on the apical and basolateral side ( Eker et al . 1994 ) . When using cytosolic acidi W cation to block clathrin - dependent endocytosis ( Sandvig et al . 1987 ) , there was still uptake of the plant toxin ricin at both poles ( Eker et al . 1994 ) . The fact that there was a larger reduction of uptake at the apical side than at the basolateral side , does , however , not necessarily provide information about the fraction of clathrin - independent endocytosis at the two poles , since the low pH might a V ect the remaining uptake at the two poles di V erently . Importantly , apical clathrin - inde - pendent endocytosis turns out to be under complex regula - tion , and can be regulated independently of uptake at the basolateral side . Using either cells permeabilized at the basolaterial side or membrane permeable compounds ( for review , see Sandvig and van Deurs 2005 ) , we have shown that apical clathrin - independent endocytosis is regulated by protein kinase A ( Eker et al . 1994 ) , protein kinase C ( Holm et al . 1995 ) , phospholipase D ( Sandvig et al . 2000 ) , cyclo - oxygenase ( Llorente et al . 2000 ) and calmodulin ( Llorente et al . 1996 ) . Interestingly , a Rho family member , appar - ently RhoA , seems to regulate apical endocytosis in a man - ner which can be supported by GTP (cid:2) S ( Garred et al . 2001 ) . The RhoA - mediated mechanism is able to mediate uptake of both gold particles , ricin - HRP and HRP .
