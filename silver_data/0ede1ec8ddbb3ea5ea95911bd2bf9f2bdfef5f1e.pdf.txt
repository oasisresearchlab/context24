Omens * y * Department of Bioengineering , and y School of Medicine , University of California , San Diego , California ABSTRACT Cardiac cells mature in the ﬁrst postnatal week , concurrent with altered extracellular mechanical properties . To investigate the effects of extracellular stiffness on cardiomyocyte maturation , we plated neonatal rat ventricular myocytes for 7 days on collagen - coated polyacrylamide gels with varying elastic moduli . Cells on 10 kPa substrates developed aligned sarcomeres , whereas cells on stiffer substrates had unaligned sarcomeres and stress ﬁbers , which are not observed in vivo . We found that cells generated greater mechanical force on gels with stiffness similar to the native myocardium , 10 kPa , than on stiffer or softer substrates . Cardiomyocyteson10kPagelsalsohadthelargestcalciumtransients , sarcoplasmiccalciumstores , andsarcoplasmic / endoplasmic reticular calcium ATPase2a expression , but no difference in contractile protein . We hypothesized that inhibition of stress ﬁber formation might allow myocyte maturation on stiffer substrates . Treatment of maturing cardiomyocytes with hydroxyfasudil , aninhibitorof RhoA kinaseandstressﬁber - formation , resulted inenhanced force generationonthestiffest gels . We conclude that extracellular stiffness near that of native myocardium signiﬁcantly enhances neonatal rat ventricular myocytes maturation . Deviations from ideal stiffness result in lower expression of sarcoplasmic / endoplasmic reticular calcium ATPase , less stored calcium , smaller calcium transients , and lower force . On very stiff substrates , this adaptation seems to involve RhoA kinase . INTRODUCTION In the early postnatal period , cardiomyocytes undergo rapid growth and maturation that is essential for normal cardiac development . This postnatal growth is modulated by not only biochemical and paracrine , but also mechanical factors ( 1 ) . An understanding of how mechanical factors inﬂuence car - diomyocyte maturation could aid in the development of cardiac cell therapies , especially because these usually assume stem cells will be injected or implanted in scarred tissue , which has signiﬁcantly altered mechanical properties from healthy myocardium ( 2 – 5 ) . Recent in vitro studies have shown that alterations in the elastic modulus of the substrate affects proliferation rates of vascular smooth muscle cells ( 6 ) , cell association and tissue formation ( 7 ) , differentiation of myoblasts into striated myo - tubes ( 8 , 9 ) , and differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into myocytes and other cell types ( 10 ) . These responses tend to approximate normal in vivo behavior more closely when the substrate stiffness is near that of the native extracellular matrix . In the myocardium , tissue elasticity shows signiﬁcant re - gional variation during heart disease ( 11 – 15 ) . Speciﬁcally , Berry et al . ( 16 ) observed that ischemic areas of rat myo - cardium showed a large increase in elastic modulus , from a normal modulus of approximately 10 – 20 kPa to a modulus of ; 50 kPa . However , the effects of alterations to the extra - cellular elastic modulus on the phenotype of individual car - diac myocytes have not been investigated . In this study , we investigate this relationship using an in vitro model system of neonatal rat ventricular myocytes ( NRVM ) cultured on elastic polyacrylamide gels during maturation . Maturation of NRVMs in an in vitro culture for a week post - isolation is apparent from their morphology and the appearance of well - deﬁned sarcomeres ( 17 ) as well as functional changes , hy - perplasia ( 18 ) , and binucleation ( 19 ) . Force and stress development in individual myocytes have generally been presented in terms of cell shortening and ve - locity ( 20 ) , although some studies have used microdevices to measure single - axis force directly ( 21 – 23 ) . Traction force microscopy can resolve forces at each point of contact be - tween the cell and substrate ( 24 , 25 ) by tracking markers embedded in the substrate and calculating the force generated by the cell . This method has been used to examine tractions in migrating cells as a function of adhesive molecule type and surface concentration ( 26 , 27 ) and investigate forces pro - duced by migrating myoﬁbroblasts ( 28 ) . One important regulator of cell morphology in regions of contractile stress is the RhoA / RhoA - kinase ( ROCK ) path - way . Previous studies have found relationships between the RhoA / ROCK pathways and changes in cytoskeletal structure and contractility in diabetic mice ( 29 ) . ROCK activation can be induced by mechanical stress and acts to prevent actin depolymerization ( 30 ) . ROCK also inhibits myosin light chain phosphatase , resulting in increased phosphorylation of nonmuscle myosin light chain ( MLC ) ( 31 ) . These effects result in an increase in the number and size of focal adhesions and lead to the development of stress ﬁbers . ROCK is nec - essary for cardiac ﬁbrosis in models of heart failure and can be speciﬁcally inhibited by either fasudil or Y - 27632 , each of which are equipotent ( 32 ) .

We tested this hypothesis by plating NRVMs on collagen - coated polyacrylamide gels and subsequently quan - tiﬁed contractile force produced by NRVMs with traction force microscopy . We also quantiﬁed inﬂuence of calcium and ROCK signaling in regulating force production by myocytes in these gels . MATERIALS AND METHODS All polyacrylamide and Western blot reactants were purchased from BioRad Laboratories ( Hercules , CA ) andotherreactantswerepurchasedfromSigma - Aldrich ( St . Louis , MO ) unless otherwise stated . Deformable polyacrylamide cell substrate preparation and tensile modulus measurement The deformable polyacrylamide substrates used in cell culture were made as in previous studies ( 26 , 27 , 33 ) . Brieﬂy , 3 % – 7 % acrylamide and a 1 : 20 ratio of bisacrylamide with 5 % ﬂuorescent beads ( Polysciences , Warrington , PA ) were polymerized with 0 . 1 % ammonium persulfate and 0 . 5 % N , N , N 9 , N 9 - tetramethylethylenediamine . This solution was pipetted onto 18 - mm glass coverslips activated with 3 - aminopropyltrimethoxysilane and 0 . 8 % glutar - aldehyde . Gels were coated with 0 . 5 mg / mL of rat tail type I collagen bound through the heterobifunctional crosslinker N - sulfosuccinimidyl - 6 - [ 4 9 - azido - 2 9 - nitrophenylamino ] hexanoate ( sulfo - SANPAH , Pierce Biotechnology , Rockville , IL ) . The tensile elastic moduli of these gels were measured as in previous studies ( 26 , 27 ) by calculating the slope of the stress - strain curve found by hanging weights from a 15 - mm thick cylinder of gel . NRVM cell isolation , culture , and plating Cardiac myocytes were harvested from freshly dissected ventricles of 1 - to 3 - day - old Sprague - Dawley rats using an isolation kit ( Cellutron , Highland Park , NJ ) . Cells were plated and cultured as described previously ( 34 ) in high - serum plating media ( Dulbecco modiﬁed Eagle media , 17 % M199 , 10 % horse serum , 5 % fetal bovine serum , 100 U / mL penicillin and 50 mg / mL streptomycin ) at 10 , 000 cells / cm 2 . Approximately 18 h later , cells were transferred to low serum maintenance media ( Dulbecco modiﬁed Eagle me - dia , 18 . 5 % M199 , 5 % horse serum , 1 % fetal bovine serum , and antibiotics ) . Cell cultures were maintained at 37 (cid:3) C and 5 % CO 2 and fresh maintenance media was added every 2 – 3 days . For hydroxyfasudil treatment studies , cells were cultured in 1 m mol / L hydroxyfasudil . For C3 toxin treatment studies , cells were cultured in 5 m g / mL exoenzyme C3 from Clostridium botulinum ( Calbiochem , San Diego , CA ) . All culture media was purchased from Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA and sera was purchased from Gemini BioProducts , West Sacramento , CA . Animal studies were in accordance with University of California guidelines . Morphology of NRVMs on gels of varying stiffness To evaluate sarcomeric deﬁnition and organization , NRVMs were ﬁxed and stained at 7 days after initial plating . Cells were ﬁxed in 0 . 75 % glutaraldehyde on icefor 20 min , permeabilizedwith0 . 1 % TritonX - 100for5minand stained with anti - a - actinin ( Sigma ) , diluted in 1 % bovine serum albumin ( Gemini BioProducts ) for 60 min .

Cellswereimagedusinga NikonEclipse TE300invertedmicroscope with a PhotometricsCascade 512X CCD camera and acquired using Metamorph software ( Molecular Devices , Sunnyvale , CA ) . NRVMs used in confocal imaging experiments were stained with Vibrant CM - DiI ( Invitrogen ) , then ﬁxed in 4 % paraformaldehyde ( Electron Mi - croscopy Sciences , Hatﬁeld , PA ) on ice for 20 min and permeabilized with 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 . Cells were stained with FITC - phalloidin and covered with gelvatol mounting medium and a coverslip . Cells were imaged on a spinning disk confocal microscope ( Olympus , Center Valley , PA ) . In addition , cell area and aspect ratio ( long axis / short axis ) were computed for all myocytes evaluated for histology , traction force , and calcium concen - tration by manually outlining cells in ImageJ ( National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , MD ) . Dynamic traction force microscopy A complete traction force map of shear stresses at the surface of the gel was obtained through traction force microscopy , in which ﬂuorescent beads em - bedded in the gel were tracked during cell contraction ( 24 , 25 ) . Individual NRVMs at 7 days post - isolation were stimulated with an 8 ms pulse at 0 . 5 Hz . Voltage was increased from 0 . 1 V until the cell began beating . Cells that were in contact with other cells and those that did not beat were excluded . The deformation ﬁeld and corresponding traction ﬁeld were computed with cus - tom - written MATLAB 7 . 0 code ( The MathWorks , Natick , MA ) as described in the Expanded Materials and Methods in Supplementary Material , Data S1 . Calcium transient and caffeine - induced calcium release measurement with Fura - 2 and Fluo - 4 NRVMsat 7 dayspost - isolationwereloadedwith2 m mol / LFura - 2orFluo - 4 ( Molecular Probes ) in high - calcium Tyrodes buffer ( 130 mmol / L NaCl , 5 . 4 mmol / L KCl , 2 mmol / L CaCl , 1 mmol / L MgCl 2 , 0 . 3 mmol / L Na 2 HPO 4 , 10 mmol / L HEPES , 5 . 5 mmol / L glucose at pH 7 . 4 ) . Cells were stimulated as detailed above and imaged using a Nikon Eclipse TE3000 inverted micro - scope with a Lambda DG - 4 ﬁlter changer ( Sutter Instruments , Novato , CA ) and a Photometrics Cascade 512X CCD camera , acquired using Metamorph software ( Molecular Devices ) and analyzed as detailed in the Expanded Materials and Methods in Data S1 . The amount of calcium stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of NRVMs was quantiﬁed by adding 10 mmol / L caffeine and measuring the resulting change in ﬂuorescence as describedabove . Caffeine - induced calcium release was then reported as the plateau of ﬂuorescence intensity after the addition of caffeine divided by the baseline ﬂuorescence . Western blot analysis of contractile and calcium handling proteins Western blot analysis was used to assess the amount of actin , myosin , sar - coplasmic / endoplasmic reticular calcium ATPase ( SERCA ) , phospho - lamban ( PLN ) , and L - type calcium channel protein . At 7 days after plating , a lysate buffer ( 1 % Triton X - 100 , 5 mmol / L EDTA , 5 mmol / L EGTA , 150 mmol / L NaCl , 20 mmol / L TRIS , 1 m mol / L PMSF , 2 m mol / L Na 3 VO 4 , 1 ng / mL leupeptin , and 1 ng / mL aprotinin ) was added on ice for 30 min . As controls , freshly isolated NRVMs ( 10 6 cells ) and cardiomyocytes from a freshly dissected and lyophilized adult rat heart were lysed in 1 mL of the same lysate buffer solution on ice for 15 min . The lysates were centrifuged for 15 min at 4500 3 g and 4 (cid:3) C and the supernatant was frozen at (cid:2) 20 (cid:3) C . Protein content was determined with a BCA protein assay kit ( Pierce Bio - technology ) . Cell lysates with equal amount of total protein were separated with 4 % – 12 % denaturing SDS PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane . Total protein content and transfer effectiveness was assayed by staining with Ponceau Solution and myosin heavy chain ( MHC ) content was assessed from scans of this stain . Membranes were washed in a TBST buffer ( 20 mmol / L Tris , 500 mmol / L NaCl , and 0 . 5 % Tween 20 ) , blocked with 5 % nonfat dry milk ( Carnation , Nestle USA , Glendale , CA ) , and blotted with 3480 Jacot et al .

RESULTS Tensile modulus of polyacrylamide gels Polyacrylamide gel elastic modulus was measured using tensile tests . The tensile modulus of the gel substrates in - creased exponentially with the concentration of acrylamide and bisacrylamide ( Fig . 1 ) . The elastic modulus of each in - dividual gel was linear up to at least 25 % strain ( data not shown ) . For simplicity , the elastic modulus reported here for each gel in the rest of the results and graphs was rounded to 1 kPa , 5 kPa , 10 kPa , 25 kPa , and 50 kPa for 3 % , 4 % , 5 % , 6 % , and 7 % acrylamide gels , respectively . Morphology of ventricular myocytes on different gels Differences in the structure and organization of the actin cytoskeleton were observed in cells stained for a - actinin ( Fig . 2 , A – C ) or F - actin ( Fig . 2 , D – H ) . Cells on the stiffest substrates appear to have a less structured cytoskeleton , with no apparent aligned sarcomeres and with actin localized both in the nucleus and around the perimeter of the cell . These cells also have stress ﬁbers , which were not seen in cells on softer substrates or in vivo . However , cells on the stiffest substrate could still be induced to beat when a voltage stimulus was applied . Despite these apparent morphological differences , analysis of the cell spread area and the aspect ratio , calculated as the length of the long axis of the cell di - vided by the length of the short axis , was not signiﬁcantly different between gel stiffness ( Fig . 3 , A and B ) . The circu - larity index , calculated as 4 p A / P 2 where A is the area and P is the perimeter , is signiﬁcantly greater for the cells on the stiffest gels compared to the cells on the 10 kPa gels ( Fig . 3 C ) . The circularity index would be exactly 1 for a circular cell and decreases as the cell becomes less circular and de - velops a spindle , myocytes - like morphology . Dynamic traction force microscopy and shortening velocity An analysis of the percentage of cells that contracted when electrically stimulated shows a negative correlation with elastic modulus , as 85 % , 65 % , 55 % , 55 % , and 45 % of cells ( n ¼ 20 ) on 1 , 5 , 10 , 25 , and 50 kPa gels , respectively , contracted when stimulated . All reported values in this study only include cells that contracted when stimulated . Images of ﬂuorescent beads captured at 66 images / s were compared to the cell - free reference image to generate a dis - placement map ( Fig . 4 A ) and analyzed based on continuum equations describing gel mechanics to generate a traction map ( Fig . 4 B ) . Tractions ( in units of force / area ) were then integrated over area , resolved into their x and y components and projected onto cell axes to evaluate force versus time ( Fig . 4 C ) . Neonatal rat cardiac myocytes cultured for 7 days after isolation generated an average of 720 6 140 nN of axial force on mid - range gels of 10 kPa . However , cells plated on softer 1 kPa or stiffer 50 kPa substrates generated signiﬁ - cantly less force during contraction ( Fig . 5 A ) . Myocytes on intermediate gels of 5 kPa or 25 kPa elastic modulus gener - ated intermediate forces . The velocity of shortening of the major axis of the car - diomyocyte decreased as the extracellular substrate modulus increased ( Fig . 5 B ) . In addition , NRVMs on 50 kPa gels had sarcomeres of 2 . 23 6 0 . 09 m m ( n ¼ 5 ) and contracted 0 . 8 6 0 . 2 % ( n ¼ 15 ) of the cell length at 5 6 2 m m / s ( n ¼ 15 ) . NRVMs on 1 kPa gels had sarcomeres of 1 . 69 6 0 . 15 m m ( n ¼ 5 ) and contracted 23 6 0 . 4 % ( n ¼ 15 ) of the cell length at 10 6 1 m m / s ( n ¼ 15 ) . Calcium transients and caffeine - induced calcium release The magnitudes of calcium transients were measured in stimulated NRVMs using Fura - 2 or Fluo - 4 calcium indicator ( Fig . 6 A ) . The transient size was greatest in cardiomyocytes FIGURE 1 The Young’s modulus of elasticity of polyacrylamide gels varies over a physiologic range of 1 – 50 kPa with varying monomer from 2 % to 7 % and a 1 : 20 monomer / cross - linker ratio . Stiffness Affects NRVM Maturation 3481 Biophysical Journal 95 ( 7 ) 3479 – 3487 cultured on 10 kPa gels ( computed as 84 6 21 nmol / L from Fura - 2 data , n ¼ 6 ) and lower in cells cultured on substrates with a higher or lower elastic modulus . Note that the shape of the relationship between the calcium transient and substrate stiffness mirrored that of axial force and substrate stiffness ( from Fig . 5 ) . The magnitude of the caffeine - induced calcium release again was highest on the 10 kPa substrates and pro - gressively lower on softer or stiffer substrates ( Fig . 6 B ) . Western blot analysis of contractile and calcium handling proteins Western blots of cardiac a - actin and MHC expression ( Fig . 7 , A and B ) show no signiﬁcant differences between cardio - myocytes on any stiffness gel , suggesting the above obser - vations are functional differences , as opposed to contractile protein expression differences . Western blot analysis of SERCA2a expression ( Fig . 7 , C and D ) showed a substrate stiffness - dependent expression that mirrors calcium tran - sients ( Fig . 6 ) and axial force ( Fig . 5 ) , with the maximal SERCA2a expression occurring in cardiomyocytes cultured on gels of 10 kPa . SERCA2a expression in day - 0 myocytes was four times the amount of the expression in cells on 10 kPa gels and signiﬁcantly greater than any day - 7 conditions ( Fig . 7 C ) . Western blots showed no differences in abundance of PLN and the L - type calcium channel had no differences in expression between cells cultured on gels of different stiff - nesses ( not shown ) . Phospho - ( Ser - 16 ) - PLN was present in adult whole heart lysate but not in day - 0 or day - 7 NRVMs ( not shown ) . FIGURE 2 NRVMs on polyacryla - mide gels and labeled for a - actin have poorly deﬁned striations on soft 1 kPa substrates ( A ) , well deﬁned and aligned striations on 10 kPa substrates ( B ) , and unaligned striations with long , large stress ﬁbers on stiff 50 kPa gels ( C ) . NRVMs plated on polyacrylamide gels and labeled with phalloidin ( green ) and DiI ( red ) show an axially - aligned cyto - skeleton throughout the cell on 1 kPa ( D ) and 10 kPa ( E ) gels but F - actin concentrated on the periphery and nu - cleus and no axial alignment on 50 kPa gels ( F ) . Zoomed - in confocal images of NRVMs on 10 kPa gels ( G ) and 50 kPa gels ( H ) better show differences in sarcomeric structure and alignment . Scale bars ¼ 10 m m . FIGURE 3 Cell area ( A ) and aspect ratio ( B ) are not signiﬁcantly different across the gel stiffnesses ( ANOVA , Area p ¼ . 13 ) .

Error bars represent SE . 3482 Jacot et al . Biophysical Journal 95 ( 7 ) 3479 – 3487 Contractile force and calcium handling in hydroxyfasudil - treated cells Seven - day treatment of cell cultures with 1 m M hydroxy - fasudil , a ROCK inhibitor ( Fig . 8 A ) , or C3 toxin , a RhoA in - hibitor ( Fig . 8 B ) , resulted in a positive correlation between force and elastic modulus ( Fig . 8 ) . NRVMs cultured onboth 25 kPa and 50 kPa gels and treated with hydroxyfasudil exhibited signiﬁcantly greater traction force than control cells ( p , 0 . 05 ) . NRVMs treated cultured on 50 kPa gels and treated with C3 toxin also exhibited signiﬁcantly greater traction force than control cells ( p , 0 . 05 ) . These results suggest that the effects of substrate stiffness on NRVM maturation , at least on substrates stiffer than the native myocardium , are regulated through the RhoA / ROCK pathway . Though Western blots could detect phosphorylated myosin light chain in adult rat whole heart lysate controls , phosphorylated myosin light chain levels in NRVMs were too low to detect on any gel stiffness ( results not shown ) . However , immunostaining of ﬁxed cells shows very low levels of phospho - ( ser19 ) - MLC in NRVMs on soft gels and phospho - ( ser19 ) - MLC associated with cytoskeletal ﬁbers on gels of 25 kPa and higher stiffness ( results not shown ) . DISCUSSION We hypothesized that substrate stiffness affects the maturation of cultured NRVMs . We found that substrate stiffness does affect force generation , with maximal force generation on substrates of 10 kPa , near the stiffness of native myocardium . In cardiac myocytes , contractile force is regulated by the size and duration of the calcium transient during contraction , and in adult myocytes , most of this calcium comes from the sarcoplasmic reticulum ( SR ) . The size of these stores and the rate of their release are strongly controlled through actions involving SERCA2a , which pumps calcium ions into the sarcoplasmic stores , and the ryanodine receptor ( RyR2 ) , which releases calcium from the SR ( 35 ) . SERCA2a is pre - dominantly regulated by PLN , which is itself inhibited when phosphorylated ( 36 ) . Studies have found signiﬁcantly in - creased expression in both RyR2 ( 37 ) and SERCA2a ( 38 , 39 ) in maturing NRVMs . On the other hand , the expression of PLN does not change signiﬁcantly after embryo day 12 ( 37 ) . As a result , the amount and regulation of calcium storage in these cardiac myocytes signiﬁcantly changes ( 40 ) , resulting in altered shape and size of calcium transients during cell contraction ( 41 ) . We found that the magnitude of force generation in NRVMs correlates with the magnitude of the calcium transient , the amount of SR calcium and the ex - pression of SERCA2a , suggesting that substrate stiffness affects calcium dynamics as a mechanism of contractile force regulation . However , the effect of substrate stiffness on NRVM force generation seems to also involve cytoskeletal structure and sarcomere alignment , as NRVMs cultured on 10 kPa gels , as well as softer gels , have well deﬁned sarco - meres whereas NRVMs on the stiffest gels have less sarco - mere deﬁnition and alignment and many of these cells have stress ﬁbers . One might hypothesize that these stress ﬁbers interfere with the development and organization of sarco - meres and the maturation of NRVMs . Having shown that substrate stiffness affects cell behavior , morphology , and calcium handling in NRVMs cultured for 7 days , we tested the hypothesis that the observed maturation differences on gels of different stiffness involves the ROCK pathway . We found that blocking the ROCK pathway with hydroxyfasudil inhibits the reduction in cell traction force on substrates stiffer than 10 kPa . The force of cardiomyocyte contraction has been shown to be directly related to the change in cell length and indirectly related to the contractile velocity ( 42 ) . Though the direct relationship between length , velocity , tension , and contractile force depends on many kinetic parameters ( 43 ) not measured as part of this study , we did measure greater starting sarcomere length , lower change in cell length and lower velocity in cells on the stiffest gel versus the softest gel and these effects could , in themselves , cause the observed force relationship in cells treated with hydroxyfasudil . These results suggest that NRVMs fail to mature when plated on substrates that are stiffer than the native myocardium through a mechanism that results in FIGURE 4 Traction force microscopy provides a measurement of cell contractile force without disturbing cell attachment . Cells were stimulated at 0 . 5 Hz for 0 . 8 ms and the movement of ﬂuorescent beads embedded in the substrate was imaged . Bead displacement between images was tracked using a cross - correlation algorithm ( A ) . Scale bar ¼ 10 m m , scale arrow is 10 m m displacement . These displacements were converted to shear stresses on the gel surface ( B ) . Scale bar ¼ 10 m m , scale arrow is 1 kPa ( 1000 nN / m m 2 ) . The stresses were projected onto the long and short axis of the cell and integrated over the cell area to calculate an axial and longitudinal force over time ( C ) . Stiffness Affects NRVM Maturation 3483 Biophysical Journal 95 ( 7 ) 3479 – 3487 lower contractile force and involves RhoA and ROCK . Be - cause stimulation of the RhoA / ROCK pathway leads to the formation of actin stress ﬁbers ( 32 ) and fasudil - treated car - diomyocytes on the stiffest gels exhibit well deﬁned sarco - meres rather than stress ﬁbers , this result is congruent with a hypothesis that the formation of actin stress ﬁbers has a negative effect on sarcomeric formation and the maturation of neonatal ventricular myocytes . In addition , some models of the formation of mature myoﬁbrils involve stress ﬁber scaffolds in the earliest stage of sarcomere development , which then allow premyoﬁbrils , which are scattered units of sarcomeric proteins , to form into sarcomeres ( 44 ) . This model is consistent with the hypothesis that stress ﬁbers represent a less mature stage in cardiomyocyte development , and also consistent with the observation that the amount of the sarcomeric a - actin and MHC proteins are constant across gels of varying stiffness but the organization into sarcomeres changes as NRVMs mature . NRVMs cultured for 7 days after isolation generated ; 700 nN of force on mid - stiffness gels of 10 kPa , which is ap - proximately the range of stiffness found in normal resting heart tissue ( 45 ) . This force is about half the axial force measured in fully mature adult myocytes ( 22 ) . Furthermore , the peak calcium transient on 10 kPa gels for NRMVs at FIGURE 6 The relationship between measures of calci - um handling in NRVMs and substrate stiffness mirrors the force relationship . The magnitude of calcium transients ( A ) , measured as peak ﬂuorescence divided by baseline ﬂuores - cence , in Fura - 2 or Fluo - 4 labeled NRVMs on 10 kPa gels was signiﬁcantly greater than transients on 1 kPa and 50 kPa gels ( p , 0 . 05 ) ( A ) . n ¼ 6 , 7 , 10 , 7 , and 9 for 1 , 5 , 10 , 25 , and 50 kPa substrates , respectively . The magnitude of sarcoplasmic calcium stores ( B ) , measured as the plateau of Fluo - 4 ﬂuorescence after stimulation with caffeine divided by baseline ﬂuorescence , was signiﬁcantly different per ANOVA ( p , 0 . 05 ) and the calcium release of the cells cultured on 50 kPa gels was signiﬁcantly lower than on 1 kPa and 10 kPa gels ( p , 0 . 05 ) . n ¼ 13 , 8 , 12 , 4 , and 4 for 1 , 5 , 10 , 25 , and 50 kPa substrates , respectively . Represen - tative traces of calcium transients ( C ) and of caffeine - induced calcium release transients ( D ) are also shown . FIGURE 5 Axial contraction force ( A ) peaks in cells on 10 kPa gels and decreases in cells on stiffer or softer gels . The contraction force was calculated through dynamic traction force microscopy . Contraction force is signiﬁcantly different across all gels per ANOVA and force was signif - icantly greater on 10 kPa gels compared to 1 kPa and 5 kPa gels ( p , 0 . 05 ) . The velocity of shortening of the major axis ( B ) trends downward as stiffness increases though individ - ual velocities are not signiﬁcantly different per ANOVA . The resting axial force increases as the substrate stiffness increase ( C ) though individual points are not different per ANOVA . All points are averages of 15 cells .

Biophysical Journal 95 ( 7 ) 3479 – 3487 7 days past isolation was 81 nM , which is only ; 25 % of the magnitude of the calcium transient measured in NRVMs at 7 days post isolation in other studies of cells cultured on glass ( 40 ) . In addition , NRVMs cultured for 7 days , even on the ideal gel stiffness of 10 kPa , expressed less cardiac - a - actin and MHC than adult rat cardiomyocyte controls . These cells are more likely somewhere between neonatal and adult phenotypes and morphology , indicating that a synergy exists between mechanical cues and chemical ones , as has been found in stiffness control experiments of myocyte develop - ment from mesenchymal stem cells ( 10 ) . In summary , we have shown that substrate stiffness affects functional maturation in NRVMs . NRVMs cultured for 7 days post - isolation produce maximal force on substrates of ; 10 kPa . The mechanism of altering contraction force ap - pears to act through maximal expression of SERCA2a on the 10 - kPa gels , resulting in maximal SR calcium load and cal - cium transients during contraction . The mechanotransduction pathway leading to this effect involves protein signaling by ROCK and inhibition of ROCK seems to inhibit cell adaptation to extracellular stiffness . We speculate that cytoskeletal rearrangements induced by activa - FIGURE 8 Inhibition of ROCK with hydroxyfasudil ( A ) signiﬁcantly inhibits the decrease in force observed by NRVMs on stiff gels of 25 kPa and 50 kPa elastic modulus ( p , 0 . 05 ) and force continually increases with increasing stiffnessinfasudil - treatedcells .

FIGURE 7 Results of Western blots of cell lysates for cardiac a - actin and MHC ( A ) show no differences in expression ( B and C ) . Amounts of a - actin are signiﬁcantly different per ANOVA and cells cultured on 10 kPa gels have signiﬁcantly more actin than 0 - day controls . Amount of myosin is greater in all cases but individual results were not signiﬁcant . Western blot for SERCA2a ( D ) shows differences in expression that mirrors sarcoplasmic calcium stores , calcium transients , and force ( E ) . Expression of SERCA2a is signiﬁcantly different across gels per ANOVA ( p , 0 . 05 ) though individual differences are not signiﬁcant . Data presented are the average of protein analysis from four separate lysates , normalized to the average expression of the protein from day - 0 unplated NRVMs . Stiffness Affects NRVM Maturation 3485 Biophysical Journal 95 ( 7 ) 3479 – 3487 tion of the ROCK pathway in environments stiffer than those typically found in native myocardium may prevent sarcomere development and maturation of cardiomyocytes . These path - ways may be applicable not only in cardiomyocyte develop - ment , but also in the progression of congenital heart diseases and cardiomyopathies . Furthermore , extracellular substrate stiffness could possibly inﬂuence stem cell differentiation in recent therapies of injected stem cells postinfarction and could play a role in cardiomyopathies after infarction - in - duced changes in myocardial stiffness .
