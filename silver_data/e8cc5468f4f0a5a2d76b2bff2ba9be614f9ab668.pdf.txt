Determining the subcellular localization is important for understanding the biological functions of proteins . Here , we developed a set of rice organelle marker lines , in which the expressing fluorescent organelle markers could be used as comparative standards in determining the subcellular localization of the protein of interest . We constructed green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) - and / or Discosoma sp . red fluorescent protein ( DsRed ) - tagged organelle markers targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) , mitochondria , Golgi apparatus , peroxisome , actin cytoskeleton , plastid , tonoplast , plasma membrane , and nucleus , respectively . The utility of the rice marker lines for protein subcellular localization studies was demonstrated by detecting a nucleus - localized OsWRKY45 and a mitochondria - associated NbHxk1 in protoplasts of the GFP - OsH2B and the ScCOX4 - DsRed lines , respectively . Using a sheath - inoculation method , followed by a live - cell imaging , we detected co - localization of a Magnaporthe oryzae PWL2 : mCherry : NLS fusion with the nucleus marker in the GFP - OsH2B rice epidermal cells , confirming the translocation of the M . oryzae effector PWL2 into host cells , and further demonstrating the feasibility of using the organelle marker lines for studying dynamics of proteins in rice cells in the interactions between rice and pathogens . The set of organelle marker lines developed in the present study , provides a valuable resource for protein subcellular localization studies in rice . Keywords : fluorescent protein , organelle marker lines , protein subcellular localization , rice , Magnaporthe oryzae Frontiers in Plant Science | www . frontiersin . org November 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 1421 ORiGinaL ReSeaRch doi : 10 . 3389 / fpls . 2019 . 01421 published : 05 November 2019 Organelle Marker Rice Lines Chen et al . 2 inTRODUcTiOn Eukaryotic cells are highly compartmentalized and various biological processes are implemented within specialized subcellular compartments ( Nelson et al . , 2007 ) . In general , the subcellular localization of proteins is closely associated with functions related to the biological processes carried out in the corresponding organelles ( Lunn , 2007 ; Mathur , 2007 ) . Thus , information on the subcellular localization is helpful in understanding the biological functions of proteins ( Martin et al . , 2009 ; Tanz et al . , 2013 ) . Protein subcellular localization analysis has been routinely employed as an experimental methodology for gene functional studies . Over the past decades , fluorescent protein ( FP ) tagging has become the dominant approach for determining the subcellular localization of proteins in living cells in different organisms , including plants ( Chudakov et al . , 2010 ; Tanz et al . , 2013 ) . Based on fusion of FPs with the well - established targeting proteins or motifs ( Mathur , 2007 ) , numerous sets of fluorescent organelle markers have been developed for Arabidopsis ( Nelson et al . , 2007 ; Geldner et al . , 2009 ; Kim et al . , 2013 ) , Nicotiana benthamiana ( Martin et al . , 2009 ) , Medicago truncatula ( Luo and Nakata , 2012 ) , maize ( Wu et al . , 2013 ; Krishnakumar et al . , 2015 ) , and rice ( Wu et al . , 2016 ; Dangol et al . , 2017 ) . Currently , the common strategy utilized to detect localization of FP - tagged proteins has been based on transient expression of fusion constructs in protoplasts through polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) - mediated transfection ( Chen et al . , 2006 ; Zhang et al . , 2011 ) , or in epidermal cells through biolistic bombardment ( Dangol et al . , 2017 ) or agro - infiltration ( Lunn , 2007 ; Nelson et al . , 2007 ) . Although transient expression systems provide convenient and rapid assays for subcellular localization , the approaches have limitations in monitoring processes in a developmental context or under particular environmental conditions , such as in response to abiotic stresses , or pathogen attack ( Geldner et al . , 2009 ) . Recently , transgenic lines stably expressing FP - tagged organelle markers have been generated in Arabidopsis , M . truncatula , maize , and rice ( Geldner et al . , 2009 ; Luo and Nakata , 2012 ; Kim et al . , 2013 ; Wu et al . , 2013 ; Krishnakumar et al . , 2015 ; Wu et al . , 2016 ) . These transgenic marker lines provided valuable resources for protein subcellular localization studies , especially for studying the dynamics of proteins or organelles in developmental or environmental contexts ( Geldner et al . , 2009 ; Kim et al . , 2013 ; Wu et al . , 2016 ) . Rice is one of the most important food crops in the world , as well as a monocot model plant . More recently , sets of fluorescent organelle markers have been developed for protein subcellular localization studies in rice ( Wu et al . , 2016 ; Dangol et al . , 2017 ) . However , only green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) - based organelle marker lines have been generated in rice ( Wu et al . , 2016 ) . In the present study , to provide more flexible combinations of organelle marker lines , we developed transgenic rice plants stably expressing GFP - and / or Discosoma sp . red fluorescent protein ( DsRed ) - tagged organelle markers . We demonstrated the utility of the marker lines for co - localization studies by detecting a nucleus - localized rice OsWRKY45 and a mitochondria - associated N . benthamiana hexokinase NbHxk1 in protoplasts of the GFP - OsH2B and the ScCOX4 - DsRed rice lines , respectively . In addition , we demonstrated the feasibility of using the organelle marker lines for studying dynamics of proteins in rice cells in the interactions between rice and pathogens . Using a sheath - inoculation method , followed by a live - cell imaging ( Khang et al . , 2010 ; Park et al . , 2012 ) , we detected co - localization of a Magnaporthe oryzae PWL2 : mCherry : NLS fusion with the nucleus marker in the GFP - OsH2B rice epidermal cells , confirming the translocation of the M . oryzae effector PWL2 into host cells . The organelle markers and marker lines developed in this study , along with previously developed organelle markers and marker lines ( Wu et al . , 2016 ; Dangol et al . , 2017 ) , therefore , provide valuable resources for protein localization studies in rice . MaTeRiaLS anD MeThODS Generation of Organelle Marker constructs The s GFP ( S65T ) gene ( Chiu et al . , 1996 ) and the DsRed gene ( Goodin et al . , 2002 ) were used for the construction of fluorescent organelle marker constructs . GFP - or DsRed - fusion fragments were generated by overlapping PCR and were cloned into a plant binary vector , pCXSN ( Chen et al . , 2009 ) in which the GFP - or DsRed - fusions were driven by the CaMV 35S promoter . All constructs were confirmed by sequencing . Primers used for PCR or overlapping PCR were listed in Supplementary Table S1 . agro - infiltration assay in Nicotiana benthamiana The organelle marker constructs were introduced into the Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 . Transformed GV3101 bacteria were cultured in liquid yeast extract peptone media supplemented with kanamycin ( 50 ug / ml ) and rifampicin ( 50 ug / ml ) . Suspensions of transformed GV3101 bacteria were adjusted to an OD 600 of 0 . 7 in the infiltration buffer ( 10 mM MES , 10 mM MgCl 2 , and 150 μM acetosyringone ) , and were maintained at room temperature for 2 h . The suspension cultures were infiltrated into leaves of 4 - week - old N . benthamiana plants grown in a growth chamber at 25°C under 16 / 8 h light / dark cycle . Rice Transformation The organelle marker constructs were introduced into A . tumefaciens LBA4404 by electroporation . Rice calli induced from the embryos of mature seeds of cv . Nipponbare were used for transformation via the Agrobacterium - mediated method as described previously ( Hiei et al . , 1994 ) . Regenerated transgenic plants and their self - pollinated progeny were grown in a greenhouse . Rice Protoplast isolation and Transfection Protoplasts were isolated from 2 - week - old rice seedlings of transgenic rice organelle marker lines or wild type rice Frontiers in Plant Science | www . frontiersin . org November 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 1421 Organelle Marker Rice Lines Chen et al . 3 cv . Nipponbare . PEG - mediated protoplast transfection was performed as described previously ( Chen et al . , 2006 ) . Protoplasts were incubated under dark at room temperature for 16 – 24 h . Rice Leaf Sheath inoculation With Magnaporthe oryzae A transgenic M . oryzae isolate carrying a PWL2 : mCherry : NLS expression cassette ( Khang et al . , 2010 ) was used for rice sheath inoculation . Rice leaf sheath inoculation with M . oryzae was performed as described previously ( Khang et al . , 2010 ; Park et al . , 2012 ) . In brief , leaf sheaths were detached from 4 - week - old rice seedlings , and were cut into 5 – 6 cm segments . Inoculation was performed by incubating fungal spores ( 1 × 10 5 conidial / ml ) in inner interior of leaf sheaths . The inoculated sheaths were placed in a petri dish and were incubated under high humidity ( 95 % ) and at 26°C for about 2 days before microscopic inspection . Fluorescence Visualization Fluorescence imaging was performed on a Leica DMi8 Laser Scanning Confocal microscope ( Leica , Wetzlar , Germany ) . Excitation / emission wavelengths were 488 / 535 nm for GFP , and 552 / 610 nm for RFP . ReSULTS Plant expression cassettes for Green Fluorescent Protein – / Discosoma sp . Red Fluorescent Protein - Fusion Organelle Markers To develop rice marker lines with flexibility for co - localization assays , two commonly used FP genes , GFP and DsRed , were used to generate plant expression cassettes for organelle markers . The fusion markers were designed to target the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) , mitochondria , Golgi apparatus , peroxisome , actin cytoskeleton , plastid , tonoplast , plasma membrane , and nucleus , respectively ( Figure 1 ) . The targeting signal sequences for the ER [ signal peptide of AtWAK2 ( He et al . , 1999 ; Nelson et al . , 2007 ) at the N - terminus and a His - Asp - Glu - Leu ( HDEL ) motif at the C - terminus of FPs ] , mitochondria ( first 29 - AA transit peptide of ScCOX4 ) ( Köhler et al . , 1997 ; Nelson et al . , 2007 ) , Golgi apparatus ( C - terminal 125 - AA residues of AtCASP ) ( Renna et al . , 2005 ) , peroxisomes [ peroxisomes targeting signal 1 ( PTS1 ) , Ser - Lys - Leu motif ] ( Reumann , 2004 ; Nelson et al . , 2007 ) , and actin cytoskeleton [ C - terminal residues ( AA 2345 - 2541 ) of mouse mTalin ] ( McCann and Craig , 1997 ; Kost et al . , 1998 ) were achieved according to previous reports . As for developing markers targeted to the plastid , tonoplast , plasma membrane , FiGURe 1 | List of green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) - and Discosoma sp . red fluorescent protein ( DsRed ) - tagged organelle markers developed in this study . All chimeric GFP or DsRed fusion genes were placed under the control of a CaMV 35S promoter . 35S Promoter , CaMV 35S promoter ; FP , fluorescent protein gene GFP or DsRed ; AtWAK2 , signal peptide sequence of AtWAK2 gene ; HDEL , ER retention signal sequence ; ScCOX4 , transit sequence of ScCOX4 ; AtCCASP , coding sequence of C - terminal region of AtCASP ; PTS1 , peroxisomes targeting signal 1 sequence ; mTn , coding sequence of C - terminal residues of mouse mTalin ; OsCTP1 , transit peptide sequence of rice rubisco activase small subunit ; Osγ - TIP , coding sequence of rice vacuolar membrane aquaporin ; OsPIP2 , coding sequence of rice plasma membrane aquaporin ; OsH2B , coding sequence of rice histone 2B ; Tnos , nopaline synthase terminator . Frontiers in Plant Science | www . frontiersin . org November 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 1421 Organelle Marker Rice Lines Chen et al . 4 and nucleus , the coding sequences of rice orthologs of the first 48 - AA transit peptide of rubisco activase small subunit ( OsCTP1 ) , the vacuolar membrane aquaporin ( Osγ - TIP ) , the plasma membrane aquaporin ( OsPIP2 ) , and the histone 2B ( OsH2B ) were fused with GFP or DsRed , respectively ( Figure 1 ) . The GFP - or DsRed - fusions were placed under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter , allowing for high - level expression in both dicot and monocot plants ( Chen et al . , 2009 ) . Subcellular Localizations of Rice OscTP1 , Osγ - TiP , OsPiP2 , and Osh2B in Nicotiana benthamiana To validate the subcellular localization patterns of the four rice ortholog organelle markers , GFP - fusions of rice OsCTP1 , Osγ - TIP , OsPIP2 , and OsH2B were transiently expressed and investigated in N . benthamiana leaves , respectively . Microscopy of leaf epidermal cells showed that , while N . benthamiana leaves infiltrated with the 35S - GFP expression cassette displayed green fluorescence distributed uniformly throughout the whole cells ( Figures 2B , C ) , the expression of OsCTP1 - GFP , Osγ - TIP - GFP , GFP - OsPIP2 , or GFP - OsH2B showed specific fluorescence patterns as expected : green fluorescence emitted from OsCTP1 - GFP accumulated at the granular plastids ( Figures 2E , F ) ; Osγ - TIP - GFP signal appeared in the shape of small rings surrounds the vacuole ( Figures 2H , I ) ; fluorescent signal of GFP - OsPIP2 located at the periphery of the cells ( Figures 2K , L ) ; and GFP - OsH2B produced green fluorescence targeted to the nucleus of the epidermal cells ( Figures 2N , O ) . These results also suggested that the four rice orthologs , OsCTP1 , Osγ - TIP , OsPIP2 , and OsH2B had conserved subcellular localization patterns across dicot and monocot species . Generation of Stable Rice Lines expressing Green Fluorescent Protein / Discosoma sp . Red Fluorescent Protein - Fusion Organelle Markers The binary vectors harboring expression cassettes for GFP / DsRed - fusion organelle markers were introduced into the rice cultivar Nipponbare by Agrobacterium - mediated transformation , and more than 20 independent T 0 plants were generated for each construct . T 0 plants were screened by detecting fluorescent signals from the sliced - sheath tissues , and T 1 lines derived from T 0 plants with good fluorescent signal were used for detailed analyses . Microscopic analysis of sheath cells showed that most of the GFP / DsRed - fusions could be stably expressed in rice ( Figure 3 ) . Fluorescent signals in transgenic rice expressing AtWAK2 - GFP - HDEL or AtWAK2 - DsRed - HDEL exhibited typical ER localization patterns , forming reticulate networks throughout the cytoplasm ( Figures 3C , D ) . The mitochondria targeting ScCOX4 - GFP or ScCOX4 - DsRed appeared as small spots , randomly distributed in the cytoplasm ( Figures 3E , F ) . GFP - AtCCASP showed punctate fluorescence corresponding to the typical Golgi localization pattern ( Figure 3G ) . GFP or DsRed fused with the C - terminal peroxisome - tagging PTS1 motif , Ser - Lys - Leu , both appeared as spherical dots dispersed in the cytosol ( Figures 3I , J ) . Red fluorescence labeling of the actin cytoskeleton was observed in DsRed - mTn - transgenic rice lines , showing as a dense filamentous network ( Figure 3L ) . The fluorescence patterns of OsCTP1 - GFP ( Figure 3M ) , Osγ - TIP - GFP ( Figure 3O ) , GFP - OsPIP2 ( Figure 3Q ) , and GFP - OsH2B ( Figure 3S ) in transgenic rice were consistent , respectively , with the plastid - , tonoplast - , plasma membrane - , and nucleus - localization patterns observed in N . benthamiana . The OsCTP1 - DsRed , Osγ - TIP - DsRed , and DsRed - OsPIP2 markers displayed similar localization patterns ( Figures 3N , P , R ) as OsCTP1 - GFP , Osγ - TIP - GFP , and GFP - OsPIP2 , respectively . Unexpectedly , we were unable to obtain DsRed - AtCCASP - , GFP - mTn - , or DsRed - OsH2B - transgenic rice plants expressing obvious fluorescent signals ( data not shown ) . Protoplasts isolated from the above transgenic rice lines were subjected to microscopic analysis , and the results were consistent with the observations in sheath cells ( Figure 4 ) . To rule out the possibility that the DsRed - AtCCASP , GFP - mTn , and DsRed - OsH2B cassettes were not working for expression , we further transiently evaluated the three expression cassettes in N . benthamiana leaf cells and in rice protoplasts . Transient expression assays showed that the DsRed - AtCCASP , GFP - mTn , and DsRed - OsH2B fusions could be expressed in N . benthamiana leaves and rice protoplasts , producing fluorescent signals targeted to the Golgi apparatus , actin cytoskeleton , and nucleus , respectively ( Supplementary Figure S1 ) . These results indicated that the DsRed - AtCCASP , GFP - mTn , and DsRed - OsH2B cassettes were working for expression . Thus , it remains to be determined whether the three fusion proteins had harmful effects or there are other reasons that resulted in the failure to obtain transgenic rice lines stably expressing DsRed - AtCCASP , GFP - mTn , or DsRed - OsH2B . Organelle Marker Lines for co - Localization Studies To test the utility of the GFP / DsRed - fusion organelle marker lines for protein co - localization studies , we selected a rice transcriptional factor OsWRKY45 ( Shimono et al . , 2007 ) and a N . benthamiana mitochondria - associated hexokinase NbHxk1 ( Kim et al . , 2006 ) for proof - of - concept testing . OsWRKY45 fused with a mCherry and NbHxk1 fused with a GFP , were expressed in protoplasts of the GFP - OsH2B and ScCOX4 - DsRed rice lines , respectively . The results showed that the red fluorescence of OsWRKY45 - mCherry was merged with the nucleus GFP - OsH2B marker , and the fluorescent signal of NbHxk1 - GFP was partly merged with the mitochondria ScCOX4 - DsRed marker ( Figure 5 ) . Overall , these experiments demonstrated that using protoplasts of the organelle marker lines can facilitate protein co - localization studies in rice cells . Green Fluorescent Protein - Osh2B Marker Line for Detecting Translocation of Magnaporthe oryzae effector into host Rice cells FP - tagged organelle marker plants provided powerful tool to study dynamics of proteins or organelles in plant cells in Frontiers in Plant Science | www . frontiersin . org November 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 1421 Organelle Marker Rice Lines Chen et al . 5 response to various stimuli , including pathogen attack . For example , Arabidopsis plants expressing various GFP - tagged organelles have been successfully used for investigating the subcellular reorganization of host cells in response to pathogen attack ( Takemoto et al . , 2003 ; Koh et al . , 2005 ; Lu et al . , 2012 ) . In this study , we performed sheath - inoculation FiGURe 2 | Transient validation of green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) fusions of four rice orthologs . The binary vectors harboring expression cassettes of GFP , OsCTP1 - GFP , Osγ - TIP - GFP , GFP - OsPIP2 , and GFP - OsH2B were transiently expressed in N . benthamiana epidermal cells , respectively . The subcellular localizations of GFP alone throughout the whole cells ( a – c ) , OsCTP1 - GFP at the granular plastids ( D – F ) , Osγ - TIP - GFP in the shape of small rings surrounds the vacuole ( G – i ) , GFP - OsPIP2 at the periphery of the cells ( J – L ) , and GFP - OsH2B targeted to the nucleus ( M – O ) were shown .

Our result confirmed that PWL2 : mCherry : NLS was translocated into rice cells , as indicated by co - localization with the nucleus GFP - OsH2B marker ( Figure 6 ) . This experiment also demonstrated that the organelle marker lines will be useful resources for studying dynamics of proteins or organelles in rice cells in the interactions between rice and pathogens . DiScUSSiOn In this study , we developed a set of plant expression cassettes for GFP - and DsRed - fusion organelle markers . The markers designed to target ER , mitochondria , Golgi apparatus , peroxisome , or actin cytoskeleton were based on fusion of GFP or DsRed with the well - established targeting proteins or motifs ( Mathur , 2007 ) , and the plastid , tonoplast , plasma membrane , and nucleus markers were constructed by fusing GFP or DsRed to rice orthologs of the OsCTP1 transit peptide , Osγ - TIP , OsPIP2 , and OsH2B , respectively . The binary constructs of the organelle markers were used to generate stable transgenic rice plants . Microscopic analysis of sheath cells and protoplasts of transgenic rice plants showed that most of the GFP - or DsRed - fusions could be stably expressed in rice cells . In addition , we observed no significant difference in morphological traits between wild - type and the organelle marker lines ( data not shown ) . However , we were unable to obtain transgenic plants expressing fluorescent signals of DsRed - AtCCASP , GFP - mTn , or DsRed - OsH2B , although the DsRed - AtCCASP , GFP - mTn , and DsRed - OsH2B fusions could be transiently expressed in N . benthamiana leaf epidermal cells and in rice protoplasts ( Supplementary Figure S1 ) . Indeed , we also generated another set of expression cassettes of DsRed - AtCCASP , GFP - mTn , and DsRed - OsH2B , in which the fusion organelle marker genes were driven by a strong maize ubiquitin - 1 promoter ( Christensen et al . , 1992 ; Chen et al . , 2009 ) . Similarly , no transgenic plants expressing obvious fluorescent signals of DsRed - AtCCASP , GFP - mTn , or DsRed - OsH2B were obtained with multiple tries ( data not shown ) .

Frontiers in Plant Science | www . frontiersin . org November 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 1421 Organelle Marker Rice Lines Chen et al . 9 While the reason for failure to obtain the DsRed - AtCCASP , GFP - mTn , or DsRed - OsH2B marker lines remains to be investigated , in the future , we will try to develop rice marker lines expressing green fluorescence targeted to the actin cytoskeleton , and lines expressing red fluorescence targeted to the Golgi apparatus and nucleus , respectively , using mCherry ( Shaner et al . , 2004 ) or other FP variants as reporters . The availability of organelle marker lines will facilitate protein subcellular localization studies . Both our results and previous report ( Wu et al . , 2016 ) demonstrated that protoplasts from the rice organelle marker lines were suitable for transfection with fusion constructs of the protein of interest with FPs , and the markers could be used as comparative standards in determining the subcellular localization of the protein of interest . The use of the transgenic organelle marker lines also has an advantage over transient expression assays in studying the dynamics of proteins or organelles in developmental or environmental contexts ( Geldner et al . , 2009 ) , because the transgenic lines are able to provide consistent , intact tissues for investigation under complicated conditions . For example , the Arabidopsis organelle marker lines have been used to study the interactions of Arabidopsis with oomycete ( Takemoto et al . , 2003 ; Lu et al . , 2012 ) , and powdery mildew fungus ( Koh et al . , 2005 ) . In the present study , we presented an example application of using the leaf sheaths of the GFP - OsH2B marker line for detecting translocation of a M . oryzae PWL2 effector into rice cells , demonstrating the feasibility of the rice organelle marker lines as useful tools for dissection of protein dynamics or protein reorganization involved in rice - pathogen interactions . In addition , we generated both GFP - and / or DsRed - tagged organelle markers lines . These lines will allow more flexible design of FP combinations for co - localization studies in rice . In summary , we developed a set of rice lines stably expressing GFP - and / or DsRed - tagged organelle markers , and demonstrated the utility of the marker lines for protein subcellular localization studies , especially for studying dynamics of proteins in rice cells in the interaction between rice with blast fungus . These marker lines , along with previously established organelle markers and marker lines ( Wu et al , 2016 ; Dangol et al . , 2017 ) , provide important resources for the rice research community .
