Cath . a cells express neuronal properties but lack neuronal morphology . Here , we describe a variant of Cath . a , called CAD ( Cath . a - differentiated ) , in which reversible morphological differentiation can be initiated by removal of serum or exogenously added protein from the medium . In serum - or protein - free media , CAD cells stop pro - liferating and extend long processes . Differentiated CAD cells can be maintained without serum or protein for at least 6 weeks . CAD cells are distinct from Cath . a cells ; most signiﬁ - cant , the original immortalizing oncogene , SV40 T antigen , was spontaneously lost . By immunostaining or immunoblotting , we show that CAD cells express neuron - speciﬁc proteins , such as class III (cid:98) - tubulin , GAP - 43 , SNAP - 25 , and synaptotagmin , but not GFAP . Ultrastructurally , processes from differentiated CAD cells have abundant parallel microtubules and intermediate ﬁlaments , and bear varicosities that contain both large dense - core vesicles / granules ( 120 – 160 nm ) and smaller clear vesicles ( 60 – 80 nm ) . Additionally , CAD cells express enzymatically ac - tive tyrosine hydroxylase and accumulate L - DOPA . CAD cells exhibit biochemical and morphological characteristics of pri - mary neurons and provide an unique tool for studying neuronal differentiation . Key words : CNS cell line ; catecholamine ; tyrosine hydroxy - lase ; neuronal differentiation ; T antigen ; microtubule ; interme - diate ﬁlament ; synaptic vesicle Regulation of neurogenesis within the CNS is a central focus in developmental neurobiology . Identifying factors that induce dif - ferentiation of neuronal precursors has been particularly difﬁcult to carry out in vivo . Because of the cellular complexity of the brain , with cells of different types intermingled and differentiating at different times , molecular analyses have been limited mainly to cultured primary neurons or cell lines . Whereas primary cultures from different brain regions have been studied successfully , pure neuronal cultures are often difﬁcult to prepare . In primary cul - tures , the presence of glia , which are a rich source of growth and trophic factors , complicates the search for molecules that mediate neuronal maturation . In addition , the number of primary neurons that can be obtained may be limited for studies on discrete neuronal populations . On the other hand , immortalized cell lines obviate many of these difﬁculties , but their differentiation is usu - ally limited . In addition , they often express high levels of an immortalizing oncogene and are rarely of purely CNS origin . Among the immortalized cell lines that have been studied , several can be induced to differentiate by altering growth condi - tions or by adding trophic factors . The neuroblastoma C - 1300 cell line , derived from a spontaneous murine tumor , differentiates in low serum into neurons that are excitable , bear long processes , and express neurotransmitter - synthesizing enzymes ( Augusti - Tocco and Sato , 1969 ; Nelson et al . , 1969 ; Schubert et al . , 1969 ; Seeds et al . , 1970 ; Amano et al . , 1972 ) . P19 cells , an embryonal carcinoma cell line , can be induced to differentiate morphologi - cally and biochemically with retinoic acid ( Jones - Villeneuve et al . , 1982 ) . P19 cells form structures resembling chemical synapses ( McBurney et al . , 1988 ; Yao et al . , 1995 ) and extend processes that are polarized into dendrites and axons . However , retinoic acid - treated P19 cells also give rise to glia and ﬁbroblast - like cells . Similar to P19 , a human teratocarcinoma cell line , NTere 2 / cl . D1 ( NT2 ) differentiates into postmitotic neurons ( NT2 - N ) in re - sponse to retinoic acid ( Pleasure and Lee , 1993 ; Younkin et al . , 1993 ) . NT2 cells elaborate processes that can be identiﬁed as dendrites and axons , and express a number of neuron - speciﬁc proteins including glutamate receptor channels ( Pleasure et al . , 1992 ; Younkin et al . , 1993 ) . PC12 cells are a neuroendocrine cell line derived from a rat pheochromocytoma ( Greene and Tischler , 1976 ) . Like neonatal chromafﬁn cells , PC12 cells differentiate into sympathetic neurons after nerve growth factor treatment and exhibit many neuronal properties ( Tao - Cheng et al . , 1995 ) . A CNS catecholaminergic cell line , Cath . a , was established from a brain tumor that arose in a transgenic mouse carrying wild - type SV40 T antigen ( Tag ) under the transcriptional control of the rat tyrosine hydroxylase promoter ( Suri et al . , 1993 ) . In addition to making dopamine and norepinephrine , Cath . a cells express a variety of pan - neuronal markers , including neuroﬁla - ments , synaptophysin , and voltage - gated Na (cid:49) , K (cid:49) , and Ca2 (cid:49) channels ( Suri et al . , 1993 ; Lazaroff et al . , 1996 ) . However , these cells do not bear neurites , nor can be they induced to morpho - logically differentiate under any conditions tested thus far . We report here the characterization of a variant of Cath . a , called CAD , in which neuronal differentiation can be initiated by serum deprivation . The cells can be maintained in a differentiated state without any protein added to the culture media .

These cells ex - press neuron - speciﬁc proteins not expressed in the parental line and synaptic vesicle proteins , and they bear processes and vari - cosities that resemble those of neurons . Like the parental Cath . a cell line , CAD cells express bioactive tyrosine hydroxylase . The characteristics of this cell line make it a valuable in vitro system to study neuronal differentiation . MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell culture . Cath . a cells were cultured as described previously ( Suri et al . , 1993 ) . CAD cells were grown in DMEM / F - 12 medium ( DF12 , catalog # 12 – 719F ; BioWhittaker , Walkersville , MD ) , supplemented with 8 % FBS ( HyClone , Logan , UT ) and 1 % penicillin - streptomycin ( 100 % stocks , 10 , 000 U / ml penicillin G sodium and 10 , 000 (cid:109) g / ml streptomycin sulfate in 0 . 85 % saline , Gibco , Gaithersburg , MD ) on standard tissue culture dishes in a humidiﬁed 5 % C0 2 incubator . CAD cells were pas - saged every 3 – 4 d by pipetting cells from a conﬂuent plate and triturating them in 5 ml of fresh medium . Cells were replated at a 1 : 10 dilution . To induce differentiation , CAD cells were plated in serum - containing DF12 medium , and then switched to either serum - free medium ( SFM ) or protein - free medium ( PFM ) . SFM contained 20 (cid:109) g / ml transferrin ( Sig - ma , St . Louis , MO ) and 50 ng / ml sodium selenite ( Sigma ) in DF12 medium ; PFM contained 50 ng / ml sodium selenite only . Differentiated CAD cells were grown for at least 5 d in SFM or PFM before they were used for immunostaining or Western blots . Rat HTC cells , C6 glioma cells , and ﬁbroblast cells were grown in the same medium as the CAD cells . Southern blot . Genomic DNA was isolated by the method of Laird et al . ( 1991 ) . Ten micrograms of genomic DNA was digested with Bam HI and Hin dIII and separated by electrophoresis through a 0 . 8 % agarose gel as described ( Maniatis et al . , 1989 ) . Restricted DNA was transferred to a GeneScreen plus nylon membrane ( Dupont , Boston , MA ) and probed with 32 P - Tag DNA labeled by random priming . Cell count . For the cell counts , cells were plated at 4 (cid:51) 10 4 cells / well ( Fig . 2 A ) or 2 (cid:51) 10 4 cells / well ( Fig . 2 B ) in a 6 - well tissue culture plate . On day 0 , after the cells attached to the plate , they were washed two times with DF12 medium , and then SFM or PFM was added to the appropriate wells . At each time point , cells were detached with trypsin - EDTA and collected by centrifugation . Cell number was determined with a hemocytometer . Immunostaining . Cells were grown on glass coverslips precoated with cell - TAK ( Becton Dickinson , Bedford , MA ) . After 4 – 5 d , the cells were washed once with PBS and ﬁxed with cold methanol for 10 min . Cells were incubated in primary antibodies for 1 . 5 to 2 hr at room temperature . Synaptotagmin antibody was applied as undiluted hybridoma culture supernatant . For TuJ1 and TH staining , the antibodies were diluted at 1 : 1000 and 1 : 500 , respectively , in PBS with 10 mg / ml BSA and 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 . Cells were washed with PBS and incubated with secondary antibody ( at 1 : 250 in the same diluent used for the primary antibodies ) conjugated either with ﬂuorescein ( Sigma ) or biotin ( Vector Laborato - ries , Burlingame , CA ) for 1 – 2 hr at room temperature . Biotin - labeled secondary antibody was detected with streptavidin conjugated with Texas Red ( Gibco , Gaithersburg , MD ) used at 1 : 200 . For controls , cells were processed the same way , except that primary antibodies were omitted from the initial incubation . No signiﬁcant staining was observed with any of the secondary antibodies alone ( data not shown ) . Western blots . Conﬂuent 100 mm plates of cells were washed once with sterile PBS and lysed directly on the plate with 1 ml 2 % SDS , 100 (cid:109) g / ml PMSF , 5 (cid:109) g / ml aprotinin , and 5 (cid:109) g / ml leupeptin . Lysates were sonicated for 15 sec to shear chromosomal DNA . Protein concentration was deter - mined with BCA protein assay reagent ( Pierce Chemical , Rockford , IL ) . Fifty micrograms of protein was loaded per lane onto an 10 % acrylamide - SDS gel and transferred electrophoretically to an immobilon - P mem - brane ( Millipore , Bedford , MA ) . After washing with TBS / 0 . 05 % Tween 20 ( TBST ) , nonspeciﬁc binding was blocked by incubating the membrane for 30 min in TBST containing 5 % Carnation nonfat dry milk . Primary antibodies were diluted in the same blocking solution at 1 : 5000 for Tag and SNAP - 25 antibodies , 1 : 1000 for GAP - 43 antibody , and 1 : 500 for GFAP antibody . The membrane was incubated in primary antibodies for 1 to 1 . 5 hr at room temperature , washed 3 times with TBST , and incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish perox - idase at a 1 : 5000 dilution for 0 . 5 hr . The membrane was washed three times with TBST and once with TBS , and the bands were visualized by the ECL detection system ( Amersham , Arlington Heights , IL ) . Antibodies . Antibodies were obtained as follows : TH monoclonal anti - body ( mAb ) from INCSTAR ( Stillwater , MN ) ; GFAP mAb from Bio - medical Technologies ( Stoughton , MA ) ; GAP - 43 mAb from Sigma ; monoclonal SNAP - 25 from Sternberger Monoclonals ( Baltimore , MD ) . The rabbit polyclonal Tag antibody was the kind gift of Dr . Doug Hanahan ( University of California at San Francisco ) , and the mAbs to TuJ1 and synaptotagmin ( clone 48 ) were generously provided by Dr . Anthony Frankfurter ( University of Virginia ) and Dr . William Matthew ( Duke University ) , respectively . HPLC . L - DOPA and dopamine were assayed by HPLC with electro - chemical detection . Mobile phase consisted of 10 % methanol , 50 m M NaH 2 PO 4 , pH 3 . 6 , 0 . 387 m M sodium octyl sulfate , and 0 . 1 m M EDTA . The reverse - phase column was Ultremex 3 (cid:109) m , C 18 ( Phenomenex , Tor - rence , CA ) . Plates of cells were scraped , pelleted , and sonicated in 0 . 5 ml 0 . 1 N perchloric acid . Disrupted cells were centrifuged ( 14 , 000 (cid:51) g , 4 (cid:56) C , 10 min ) , and the pellets were used for protein determination . Superna - tant was ﬁltered through 0 . 45 (cid:109) m nylon centrifuge ﬁlters ( Fisher Scien - tiﬁc , Pittsburgh , PA ) , and 20 (cid:109) l per sample was injected onto the HPLC . The applied potential of detector was 0 . 7 V . Cell pellets were dissolved in 1 N NaOH , and the protein content in each plate was determined with BCA protein assay reagent ( Pierce Chemical , Rockford , IL ) . Electron microscopy . Cells were grown on 60 mm tissue culture plates . Fixation was carried out at room temperature with 2 . 5 % glutaraldehyde in 0 . 1 M sodium cacodylate buffer , pH 7 . 4 , from 30 min to overnight . Cells were washed twice with buffer , postﬁxed with 1 % osmium tetroxide , and then mordanted in 1 % uranyl acetate for 30 min . After another wash , cells were dehydrated and embedded in pure Epon . RESULTS Reversible morphological differentiation in CAD cells In culture , Cath . a cells are small ( (cid:59) 15 (cid:109) m in diameter ) , lack pro - cesses , and grow in clumps ( Fig . 1 A ) . Cells bearing short processes spontaneously appeared in cultures of Cath . a cells and were selected by two cycles of single cell cloning . Clonality was assured by visually selecting single cells in microtiter wells for each cycle of cloning . The resulting cells , named CAD ( for Cath . a - differentiated ) , appear big - ger and ﬂatter , and grow in a more dispersed manner ( Fig . 1 B ) . They also exhibit short processes similar to the initial uncloned population . When CAD cells are switched to SFM or PFM , they undergo a dramatic morphological change . Within 1 day , the cells start to put out processes . Four days after culturing in SFM or PFM , most cells have long processes with varicosities ( Fig . 1 C , D ) . Under these con - ditions , differentiated CAD cells appear healthy despite the lack of exogenously added protein in the media . They can be maintained in this state for a minimum of 6 weeks , after which time they tend to lift off the plates as monolayers after mechanical disturbance . Detach - ment is probably a result of lack of appropriate substratum rather than death of the cells because the detached sheets can be triturated and the cells replated without serum . Coating of tissue culture dish with polylysine , collagen , laminin , or cell Tak did not prevent the tendency of the differentiated cells to lift off , although laminin did promote the initial outgrowth of processes ( data not shown ) . In contrast , when the parental Cath . a cells were switched to SFM , they died . Because many cells stop dividing when they differentiate , the growth rate of CAD cells was assessed after differentiation . As shown in Figure 2 A , in serum , the cell number doubles every 18 – 22 hr . Three days after plating , cell proliferation slows as the cells reached conﬂuence . In SFM , the proliferation rate decreases three - to fourfold , and in PFM , no signiﬁcant increase in cell number occurred over 4 d . To determine whether CAD cell differentiation is reversible , se - rum was added back after the cells were maintained in SFM or PFM for 4 d . By time lapse videomicroscopy , we observed that more than 95 % of the differentiated cells retracted their processes within 12 – 24 hr ( data not shown ) . The cell count ( Fig . 2 B ) shows that the cell 1218 J . Neurosci . , February 15 , 1997 , 17 ( 4 ) : 1217 – 1225 Qi et al . • Differentiation of a CNS Neuronal Cell Line number increased after serum addition , doubling every 18 – 22 hr . The fact that the rate of growth was the same as that of serum - grown cultures ( Fig . 2 A ) suggests that the cells fully recover the ability to cycle . Moreover , the fact that the ﬁrst doubling occurs within the ﬁrst 18 – 22 hr suggests that virtually all of the cells reenter the cycle without a lag period . Therefore , morphological differentiation con - comitant with growth arrest can be initiated in CAD cells by serum or protein deprivation , and this event is readily reversible . SV40 T antigen oncogene is lost in CAD cells Parental Cath . a cells were immortalized by SV40 T antigen ( Tag ) , which stimulates cell proliferation mainly by binding p53 and retinoblastoma proteins ( Fanning , 1992 ; Bryan and Reddel , 1994 ) . Cath . a cells express high levels of Tag , which is likely to keep the cells in the cycle and block morphological differentiation . To determine whether the CAD cells also express Tag , Western blots were performed . As shown in Figure 3 A , robust Tag expres - sion was found in Cath . a cells , but , to our surprise , no detectable Tag protein was observed in CAD cells . The presence of the Tag gene in the CAD genome was then tested by Southern blots . The original construct used to create the TH - Tag transgenic mice contains a unique Bam HI restriction site and three Hin dIII restriction sites , such that Bam HI digestion would be ex - pected to give a fragment bigger than 3 . 2 kb and Hin dIII , a 1 . 7 kb fragment ( see Suri et al . , 1993 for the plasmid construct ) . As ex - pected , in Cath . a cells , 4 . 4 kb and 1 . 7 kb Tag - containing fragments were observed with Bam HI and Hin dIII digests , respectively ( Fig . 3 B ) . In CAD cells , no Tag - containing fragments were detected , suggesting that the Tag gene was lost in CAD cells . This result was also conﬁrmed by PCR with genomic DNA ( data not shown ) . CAD cells express neuron - speciﬁc proteins The phenotype of CAD cells was evaluated with several neuronal markers including neuronal - speciﬁc class III (cid:98) - tubulin , GAP - 43 , and SNAP - 25 . Class III (cid:98) - tubulin is a tubulin isotype expressed speciﬁcally in neurons ( Sullivan et al . , 1986 ) and is recognized by a mAb , TuJ1 , speciﬁc for an epitope unique to the class III (cid:98) - tubulin isotype . TuJ1 has been shown to label neurons speciﬁ - cally . By immunocytochemistry , intense cytoplasmic staining was observed in Cath . a cells , CAD cells , and differentiated CAD cells ( Fig . 4 A – C ) . Note that all of the processes in differentiated CAD cells were stained evenly with the TuJ1 antibody . GAP - 43 and SNAP - 25 are thought to be essential in synapse formation and in maturation of synaptic contacts ( Catsicas et al . , 1991 , 1993 ; Osen - Sand et al . , 1993 ; Lakin et al . , 1995 ; Sabel et al . , 1995 ) . They are expressed by virtually all maturing neurons . GAP - 43 Figure 1 . Morphological differentiation can be induced in CAD cells .

Neurosci . , February 15 , 1997 , 17 ( 4 ) : 1217 – 1225 1219 is a membrane - bound protein found at high levels in the axons and growth cones of developing and regenerating neurons ( Kalil and Skene , 1986 ; Skene et al . , 1986 ; Strittmatter et al . , 1992 ) . SNAP - 25 is a presynaptic protein that is closely associated with integral mem - brane proteins in presynaptic membranes , and has been found to be essential in vesicle docking and fusion ( Oyler et al . , 1991 , 1992 ; Pevsner et al . , 1994 ) . To determine whether GAP - 43 and SNAP - 25 are expressed in CAD cells and whether they are increased after differentiation , Western blots were performed . GAP - 43 was ob - served in serum - grown CAD cells and was increased approximately twofold after differentiation ( Fig . 4 D ) . Its concentration in differen - tiated CAD cells was approximately one - half that observed in rat brain synaptosomes . In contrast , GAP - 43 was not detected in the parental Cath . a cells ( Fig . 4 D ) or in C6 glioma cells ( data not shown ) . SNAP - 25 was also detected in CAD , but its level was not increased after differentiation ( Fig . 4 E ) . Little or no SNAP - 25 was detected in Cath . a cells , suggesting that both SNAP - 25 and GAP - 43 proteins are increased in CAD compared with parental Cath . a cells , consistent with the neuronal morphology exhibited by CAD cells . Because many immortalized cells exhibit a neuroglial pheno - type ( Schubert et al . , 1974 ) and express both neuronal and glial proteins , we determined whether glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein ( GFAP ) was expressed in CAD cells . GFAP is a 51 kDa interme - diate ﬁlament protein that is expressed speciﬁcally in astrocytes ( Eng , 1985 ) . As shown in Figure 4 F , GFAP was detected in mouse cerebellum , a rich source of GFAP , but not in Cath . a and CAD cells , nor in ﬁbroblast cells . In summary , CAD cells express neuron - speciﬁc proteins , but not a glial marker , which supports the morphological data sug - gesting they are neuronal in nature . Ultrastructurally , differentiated CAD cells resemble a primary neuron The morphological differentiation and presynaptic protein expres - sion in CAD cells prompted us to investigate whether CAD cells have cytoskeletal and vesicular structures typical of neurons . Un - der electron microscopy , cellular organelles including mitochon - dria , endoplasmic reticulum , and abundant polyribosomes were easily identiﬁed in the cell body of differentiated CAD cells ( Fig . 5 A ) . Randomly oriented microtubules could be detected in the cytoplasm . Where a process initiated , microtubules and interme - diate ﬁlaments assumed an orientation parallel to the process . Except for mitochondria , organelles found in the cell body were largely excluded from the process . Figure 5 B showed a typical process ﬁlled with parallel microtubules and intermediate ﬁla - ments . Mitochondria , and occasionally dense - core vesicles and clear vesicles , were also observed in the processes . In the light microscope , numerous varicosities were observed along the pro - cesses and at terminals . Figure 5 C shows that in the electron microscope one such terminal contains two types of vesicles : dense - core vesicles or granules ( arrows ) with an average diameter of 120 – 160 nm and smaller , clear vesicles ( arrowheads ) with an average diameter of between 60 and 80 nm . Mitochondria and clathrin - coated vesicles were also observed in the terminals , as well as structures that resemble actin ﬁlament - rich ﬁlopodia . To determine whether synaptic vesicle proteins are present in terminals , we localized synaptotagmin ( p65 ) by immunoﬂuorescence . Synaptotagmin is an abundant synaptic vesicle protein found exclu - sively in the nervous system and certain neuronal - like secretory cells ( Matthew et al . , 1981 ; Perin et al . , 1991 ; Wendland et al . , 1991 ) . Although it is generally considered a synaptic vesicle protein , it is also present on some dense - core vesicles ( Walch - Solimena et al . , 1993 ; Egger et al . , 1994 ) . A mAb against synaptotagmin stained both differentiated and undifferentiated CAD cells ( Fig . 6 ) . Intensive staining was observed in a perinuclear position , which is likely to mark the Golgi apparatus , and in terminals and varicosities . This Figure 2 .

Neurosci . , February 15 , 1997 , 17 ( 4 ) : 1217 – 1225 Qi et al . • Differentiation of a CNS Neuronal Cell Line staining pattern is characteristic for synaptotagmin ( Tao - Cheng et al . , 1995 ) . Therefore , ultrastructurally and biochemically differentiated CAD cells resemble neurons . CAD cells are catecholaminergic neurons TH protein could be detected by immunohistochemistry in both the undifferentiated and differentiated CAD cells ( Fig . 7 ) . The staining was heterogeneous from cell to cell and was conﬁned to the cytoplasm and proximal processes . Differentiated cells had slightly stronger staining , consistent with data from Western blots showing a twofold increase in TH protein after differentiation ( Lazaroff et al . , unpublished data ) . To determine whether TH is enzymatically active in CAD cells , catecholamine production was measured by HPLC . Be - cause the parental Cath . a cells have high levels of dopamine and norepinephrine ( Table 1 ; Suri et al . , 1993 ) , we expected similar results in CAD cells . Contrary to our expectation , we detected no dopamine or norepinephrine in CAD cell extracts ( or in media from CAD - grown cells ) . Instead , we observed an accumulation of L - dihydroxyphenylalanine ( L - DOPA ) , which is the immediate product of TH action on tyrosine . Undifferen - tiated CAD cells have 163 . 17 pmol L - DOPA / mg protein , whereas differentiated cells have 254 . 913 pmol / mg protein . The higher level of L - DOPA in differentiated CAD cells may reﬂect the higher expression of TH enzyme . Rat hepatoma cell line , HTC , was used as negative control and contained no cat - echolamines . In most TH (cid:49) cells , including Cath . a , DOPA decarboxylase ( aromatic amino acid decarboxylase ) , the second enzyme in the catecholamine biosynthetic pathway , converts L - DOPA to dopamine so rapidly that L - DOPA does not accu - mulate . Hence , it is likely that TH is indeed biologically active in the CAD cells , but the lack of decarboxylase activity prevents conversion of L - DOPA to dopamine . DISCUSSION We describe here a CNS neuronal cell line that can undergo revers - ible morphological differentiation . In serum - containing medium , CAD cells are morphologically undifferentiated and proliferate with a doubling time of 18 – 22 hr . After serum withdrawal , they cease proliferation and differentiate . Insulin and insulin - like growth factors partially sustain CAD cell proliferation in SFM ( our unpublished data ) and , hence , are likely to be among the factors in serum that maintain cells in the cycle . Therefore , CAD cell differentiation is likely to be blocked by proliferation rather than by differentiation inhibitors in serum . Most immortalized cells , particularly neuronal lines like PC12 , ND7 ( Howard et al . , 1993 ; Lindenboim et al . , 1995 ) , and the parental Cath . a cells from which CAD cells were derived , die after serum deprivation . Some immortalized cells and primary neu - rons can survive for extended periods in SFM supplemented with transferrin , an iron carrier protein , and a high concentration of insulin , a growth factor , which may act as a general survival factor ( Bottenstein and Sato , 1979 ) . With few exceptions , mammalian cells need trophic factors to survive ( Raff , 1992 ) . It is surprising that differentiated CAD cells survive without any protein added to the medium for extended periods , perhaps indeﬁnitely . However , it is likely that they may make autocrine or paracrine factors that support their own survival . Alternatively , like neuroﬁbromin mutant cells ( Vogel et al . , 1995 ) , they may have sustained a gain of function mutation in a signaling pathway , which renders them trophic factor independent . It has been thought that the morphological differentiation of neural progenitors occurs after cells have stopped dividing . In CAD cells , serum deprivation reduced proliferation greatly , and protein deprivation stopped the increase in cell number immediately . Our preliminary data show that overexpression of the tumor suppressor protein p53 is sufﬁcient for morphological differentiation in the presence of serum ( our unpublished data ) . Because one of the biological activities of p53 is to arrest cell cycle progression ( Oren , Figure 3 . SV40 T antigen ( Tag ) is lost in CAD cells .

Qi et al . • Differentiation of a CNS Neuronal Cell Line J . Neurosci . , February 15 , 1997 , 17 ( 4 ) : 1217 – 1225 1221 1992 ) , cell cycle arrest alone may be sufﬁcient for CAD cell differ - entiation . Indeed , our preliminary data are consistent with the notion that CAD cells differentiate if they are blocked from proliferating by any number of treatments . When treated with cell cycle blockers ( mimosine and aphidocolin in the presence of serum ) , morphological changes consistent with limited differentiation were observed . How - ever , the processes were shorter and thicker than those in SFM , and signiﬁcant toxicity was apparent at all concentrations ( our unpub - lished data ) . Hence , differentiation may be the “default” pathway , which is over - ridden by proliferative signals . Differentiation is readily reversible . When serum was added back to cultures in SFM or PFM , more than 95 % of the cells retracted their processes within 12 – 24 hr and proliferated without a detectable lag period . Hence , the cells remain sensitive to proliferative signals unlike most terminally differentiated cells . In general , it has been difﬁcult to immortalize differentiated neurons with oncogenes ( Noble et al . , 1992 ) . Because retroviruses can only integrate into a dividing cell , this precludes immortaliza - tion of postmitotic neurons . In addition , oncogenes often prevent differentiation . For example , activated oncogenes have been shown to arrest neuronal differentiation of retinoic acid - treated P19 cells ( Boulter and Wagner , 1988 ) . In PC12 cells , both E1A and myc oncogenes block nerve growth factor - induced neurite growth ( Maruyama et al . , 1987 ; Bogenmann et al . , 1995 ) . Temperature - sensitive oncogenes have been used to generate cell lines in which the activity of the oncogene can be turned off by culturing cells at nonpermissive temperature . For example , a temperature sensitive SV40 Tag was used to generate cell lines in which the activity of Tag protein can be turned off by growing cells at high temperature ( Chou , 1989 ; Eves et al . , 1994 ; White et al . , 1994 ) . Although these cell lines differentiate at a nonpermissive temperature , it is unclear whether they can be maintained for extended periods in their differentiated state . Although the initial immortalizing oncogene , SV40 T antigen , was lost in CAD cells , it is still immortalized . As suggested by Suri et al . ( 1993 ) , it is likely that the original tumor cells , from which Cath . a and CAD were derived , required at least two “hits” for full oncogenic transformation . The primary event was the expression of the SV40 T antigen transgene , and the second was an unknown mutation that occurred stochastically over a period of 1 year or more , during which time tumors arose in vivo ( Suri et al . , 1993 ) . Hence , it is likely that the second immortalizing event sustains proliferation of the CAD line in the presence of serum . The spontaneous loss of Tag in CAD cells is fortuitous because this cell line was already committed to a neuronal phenotype , and differentiation can be easily and reversibly induced . Figure 4 . CAD cells express neuron - speciﬁc proteins . A – C , Immunocytochemical staining with TuJ1 mAb against class III (cid:98) - tubulin . Cath . a ( A ) , undifferentiated CAD ( B ) , and differentiated CAD ( C ) cells were all stained with TuJ1 antibody . D – F , Western blot with antibodies against GAP - 43 ( D ) , SNAP - 25 ( E ) , and GFAP ( F ) . Fifty micrograms of Cath . a ( CA ) , CAD , and differentiated CAD ( CADd ) cell protein were loaded in each lane . GAP - 43 was detected in both CAD cells and rat brain synaptosome ( SYN ) extracts . GAP - 43 protein was increased twofold after differentiation ( CADd ) . However , no GAP - 43 was detected in Cath . a cells . SNAP - 25 was detected in both CAD cells and synaptosome extracts , but not in Cath . a cells ( E ) . In F , Cath . a , CAD , and ﬁbroblasts ( FB ) did not express the glial - speciﬁc protein GFAP , although extracts from mouse cerebellum ( Cere . ) had abundant GFAP . 1222 J .

Neurosci . , February 15 , 1997 , 17 ( 4 ) : 1217 – 1225 1223 CAD cells are quite distinct from parental Cath . a cells , which do not undergo morphological differentiation . Although both lines express biologically active tyrosine hydroxylase , CAD cells accumulate L - DOPA but lack dopamine , suggesting that L - DOPA decarboxylase activity , which converts DOPA to dopamine , may be deﬁcient . In contrast , Cath . a cells have high levels of dopamine and undetectable levels of L - DOPA , which is converted so rapidly to dopamine it is usually undetectable in most catecholaminergic cells . The two lines also differ in transcriptional regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase . The Cath . a cells rely almost exclusively on the CRE site at (cid:50) 45 for basal enhancer activity . In contrast , CAD cells rely equally on the CRE and an AP1 site at (cid:50) 205 ( Lazaroff et al . , unpublished data ) . This equal and additive ability of the CRE and AP1 sites to direct transcription is unlike any other catecholaminergic cell line examined to date . CAD cells express neuronal markers such as GAP - 43 , syn - aptotagmin , and SNAP - 25 , which are not found in Cath . a cells . These markers are present in both proliferating and differen - tiated cells , although GAP - 43 and TH levels are modestly increased after differentiation . At the ultrastructural level , CAD cell bodies are crowded with ribosomal proﬁles , their processes are rich in microtubules and intermediate ﬁlaments , and they have both dense - core and clear vesicles in their terminals . The dense - core vesicles have an average diameter of 120 – 160 nm , and the clear vesicles are 60 – 80 nm . On the basis of light microscopy , it is likely that synaptotagmin resides in these vesicles . Although synaptotagmin is generally considered a marker for small ( 50 nm ) synaptic vesicles , it is also found in some dense - core vesicles ( Walch - Solimena et al . , 1993 ; Egger et al . , 1994 ) . Hence , synaptotagmin may be in either or both vesicular populations . In summary , we have established a clonal CNS neuronal cell line in which morphological differentiation can be initiated and maintained by removal of serum or protein from the culture media . CAD cells express biochemical markers found in dif - ferentiated neurons and , in their differentiated state , bear processes that ultrastructurally resemble neurites , complete with dense - core and clear vesicles . These properties make this cell line unique and a valuable resource for studying neuronal differentiation . Figure 6 . Immunocytochemical staining of CAD cells with synaptotagmin mAb .
