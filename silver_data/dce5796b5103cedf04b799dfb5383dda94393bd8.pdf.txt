Results Introduction With the advent of RNAi it is possible to use Drosophila In animal cells , actin polymerization at the cell cortex cells in culture as a model system to test the cell - biologi - generates the force required for the generation of mem - cal function of genes identified by genomic sequencing ; brane protrusions [ 1 ] . The precise actin - based structure such genes include those involved in the generation of formed is thought to be determined , in part , by the rela - actin - based protrusions [ 23 , 24 ] . S2R (cid:1) cells [ 25 ] are tive contributions of different members of the Rho family particularly amenable to this type of loss - of - function of small GTPases [ 2 ] . Thus , active Cdc42 promotes the analysisbecausealargenumberofdistinctactin - related formation of parallel bundles of actin filaments and fine phenotypes can be readily distinguished in this cell type actin - basedprocesses , orfilopodia [ 2 ] , whereasRacloaded [ 23 ] . Using such an approach ( see Experimental Proce - with GTP induces the formation of branched networks of dures ) , we identified several genes from a set of putative actin filaments and therefore broad protrusions , termed actin regulators that are absolutely required for the lamellipodia [ 2 ] . Cdc42 is thought to induce new actin maintenance of S2R (cid:1) cell shape and for the formation of lamellipodia . In each case , the gene - specific dsRNA identified caused cells to assume a starfish - like mor - * Correspondence : b . baum @ ucl . ac . uk Current Biology 1868 sophila SCAR / WAVE homolog ( [ 16 ] ; Figures 1B and 1J ) , and Drosophila Abi [ 26 ] , an SH3 domain - containing Abl substrate ( Figure 1C ) . In contrast , Drosophila WASP [ 16 , 27 ] , another Arp2 / 3 complex activator , had no dis - cernable RNAi phenotype in this assay ( Figure 1K ) and did not visibly accentuate the SCAR RNAi phenotype ( Fig - ure 1L ) . RNAi targeting of Arc - p34 and Arc - p20 , two components of the Drosophila Arp2 / 3 complex [ 17 ] , led to a similar change in S2R (cid:1) cell shape ( Figures 1H and 1I ) , implying that this spiky phenotype reflects the inabil - ity to nucleate new cortical actin filaments [ 1 ] . In order to follow the development of this characteris - tic morphological phenotype , we imaged SCAR RNAi and Abi RNAi cells every 60 s as they spread on a serum - coated glass substrate ( Figures 2A – 2D ; Movies 1A – 1D in the Supplemental Data available with this article online ) . Both control cells and cells treated with SCAR or Abi dsRNA were able to flatten on the substrate ( Figures 2A – 2D ) , probably as a result of integrin - mediated adhe - sion [ 23 ] . Whereas control cells rapidly extended broad lamellipodia together with fine filopodia as they spread ( Figure 2A ) , SCAR RNAi or Abi RNAi cells failed to develop significant numbers of new protrusions ( see arrows in Figures 2B – 2D ) . Instead , existing , stable protrusions flattened , whereas the cortex of SCAR RNAi and Abi RNAi cells remained relatively smooth . From these data , it can be concluded that SCAR and Abi are specifically required for the formation of dynamic actin - based pro - trusions in Drosophila cells . We used immunofluores - cence to test whether this function of SCAR is reflected in its subcellular localization . SCAR was found at the tips of both broad and fine protrusions in control S2R (cid:1) cells , distal to F - actin ( Figures 2E – 2G and arrowhead in Figures 2H and 2I ) , but it was often absent from thicker F - actin bundles , likely to represent retraction fibers ( arrow in Figures 2H and 2I ) . SCAR is therefore concen - trated at the tips of elongating processes in Drosophila cells ( as are SCAR and Abi in mammalian cells [ 28 – 30 ] ) , where it is required , together with Abi , for new actin filament formation . Because SCAR is thought to function downstream of activated Rac in several systems [ 1 , 16 ] , we tested the morphological effects of using RNAi to target Rac . In Figure 1 . Identification of Abi , Kette , and Sra1 as Positive Effectors Drosophila , three Rac homologs that function in a par - in the SCAR Pathway tially redundant fashion have been identified [ 31 ] . We F - actin was visualized with TRITC - labeled phalloidin approximately targeted all three 3 genes , Rac1 , Rac2 , and Mtl , singly 6 days after the addition of specific dsRNA in ( A ) control S2R (cid:1) cells and in combination to assess the loss - of - function phe - and in ( B and J ) SCAR , ( C ) Abi , ( D ) Kette , ( E ) Sra1 , ( F ) HSPC300 , ( G ) notype .

The slender processes that character - ize these cells contained microtubules ( data not shown ) and resemble those formed in S2R (cid:1) cellsaftertreatmentwithactincytoskel - etalinhibitors [ 23 ] .

( E – J ) SCAR protein ( green ) was localized to - gether with F - actin ( red ) . In control S2R (cid:1) cells , SCAR was found at the tips of both broad and fine cellular protrusions , distal to F - actin ( E – I ) , but was specifically lost from SCAR RNAi cells ( J ) . A fine , actin - based protru - sion is indicated with a small arrowhead , and a retraction fiber - like structure is indicated with an arrow ( H and I ) . by the expression of activated Rac1V12 ( Figures 1O - 1Q ( Figures 1D and 1E ) , whereas the fifth complex compo - nent , HSPC300 , had a somewhat variable , although re - and data not shown ) . Taken together , these data show that Cdc42 , Rac , SCAR , and the Arp2 / 3 complex consti - lated , RNAi phenotype ( Figure 1F ) . In contrast , dsRNAs targeting several other putative pathway regulators , tute elements of a pathway or functional module that controls the formation of actin filaments in Drosophila Dock ( a Drosophila Nck homolog ) , Sos , and FMR1 [ 18 , 22 ] ( Figure 1G and data not shown ) , had no visible effect cells . In these cells , Cdc42 appears to facilitate the acti - vation of Rac [ 2 ] . Cdc42 may therefore exert its effect on on actin organization or S2R (cid:1) morphology . Therefore , in the context of a Drosophila cell , Abi , Kette , and Sra1 the Drosophila actin cytoskeleton organization primarily through modulation of Rac - SCAR pathway activity . appear to act together with SCAR to promote the forma - tion of actin - based protrusions . Although a role for Abi in the SCAR pathway was initially unexpected , a mammalian homolog of Abi was To further explore the role of Abi , Kette , and Sra1 in the regulation of SCAR , SCAR protein levels were recently found to bind SCAR as part of an inhibitory complex , together with homologs of Kette , Sra1 , and analyzed in dsRNA - treated cells ( Figure 3 ) . As expected , SCAR protein was almost undetectable in cells grown HSPC300 [ 12 , 32 , 33 ] . If Abi were to negatively regulate SCAR , loss of Abi would be expected to lead to ectopic in the presence of SCAR dsRNA ( Figure 3A ) .

The fact that Abi RNAi S2R (cid:1) cells had a SCAR - like phenotype , in apparent contradiction cantly reduced ( routinely (cid:2) 90 % ) in Abi , Kette , and Sra1 dsRNA - treated cells and were reproducibly lower ( (cid:3) 50 % with this model of SCAR regulation [ 12 ] , prompted us to test the function of the other putative complex com - of the control ) in cells in which HSPC300 was targeted ( Figures 3A and 3B ) . These effects were not specific to ponents . Strikingly , dsRNA - mediated silencing of Kette or Sra1 phenocopied the effects of SCAR RNAi or Abi RNAi S2R (cid:1) cells because they were seen in another Drosoph - Current Biology 1870 Figure 3 . Loss of Abi , Kette , or Sra1 Leads to the Degradation of SCAR by the Proteasome ( A – C ) SCAR protein levels were assessed by Western blotting approximately 6 days after the addition of specific dsRNAs targeting SCAR , Abi , Kette , Sra1 , HSPC300 , Rac ( Rac1 , Rac2 , and Mtl ) , Ena , or Arc - p20 . Similar results were seen in 3 – 5 experiments and in another Drosphila cell line , UC88 cells ( B ) . A control protein , (cid:4) - Tubulin , was unaffected by treatment with dsRNA , and depletion of Ena , Sra1 , Kette , and WASP proteins was confirmed by Western analysis after addition of the corresponding dsRNA ( [ B ] and data not shown ) . ( C ) Loss of SCAR protein from Abi RNAi S2R (cid:1) cells is partially rescued by the addition of proteasome inhibitors for 4 hr ( (cid:1) ) , a treatment that has little effect on the level of SCAR in other dsRNA - treated cells or in SCAR RNAi cells . ( D and E ) The addition of proteasome inhibitors to Abi RNAi cells did not alter actin organization ( TRITC - labeled phalloidin , in red ) , SCAR localization ( green ) , or cellular morphology .

These data demonstrate that and C ) , confirming that loss of SCAR was not an indirect effect of the change in cell morphology or due to a SCAR is subject to proteasome - mediated degradation in the absence of other putative components of the perturbation in pathway signaling .

Abi RNAi Cells Develop Their Characteristic Morphological Phenotype prior to the Loss of SCAR Protein ( A ) SCAR protein levels were assayed in Abi RNAi and SCAR RNAi cells 2 – 3 . 5 days after the addition of dsRNA . (cid:4) - Tubulin was used as a loading control . ( B ) At 2 and 2 . 5 days , as SCAR levels were in decline , cells were replated on serum - coated cover slips , and actin filaments were visualized with TRITC - phalloidin . ( C ) For monitoring development of the morphological phenotype , the percentage of Abi RNAi and SCAR RNAi cells with spread , intermediate , or spiky morphologies was calculated .

To gain further support for it is possible that components of the SCAR complex facilitate the interaction between SCAR and the Arp2 / 3 this finding , we correlated loss of SCAR in Abi RNAi and SCAR RNAi cells with the development of the distinctive complex . To test this hypothesis , we expressed a GFP - tagged truncated form of SCAR , which we refer to as morphological defect . A decline in the level of SCAR protein was seen 2 days after the addition of SCAR SCAR - PVCA ( which includes the portion of the protein known to bind both G - actin and the Arp2 / 3 complex dsRNA and several hours later , at 2 . 5 days , in Abi RNAi cells ( Figure 4A ) .

The C - Terminal SCAR PVCA Domain Is Able to Activate the Arp2 / 3 Complex in the Absence of Complex Components DsRNA - treated cells were transfected with full - length SCAR ( Actin5C - Gal4 , UAS - SCAR , UAS - GFP ) ( A – C ) or SCAR - PVCA - GFP ( D – K ) .

Full - length SCAR was unable to rescue the Abi RNAi phenotype ( B ) and induced actin filament formation in the center of control or Abi RNAi cells if highly expressed ( C ) . Perinuclear aggregates of F - actin were also seen in cells transfected with SCAR - PVCA - GFP ( D , F – K ) . In this case , SCAR - PVCA - GFP ( green ) was seen to colocalize with accumulation of F - actin ( in red ; colocalization is in yellow ) and with components of the Arp2 / 3 complex ( data not shown ) . Note that SCAR - PVCA ( or full - length SCAR ) was unable to induce ectopic actin filament formation in Arc - p34 RNAi cells . Expression of SCAR or SCAR - PVCA was frequently accompanied by a loss of F - actin from the cell periphery . It may therefore compete with endogenous SCAR for components of the actin polymerisation machinery . plex were found to colocalize with clumps of GFP and additional components of the signaling cascade are re - quired for Arp2 / 3 activation .
