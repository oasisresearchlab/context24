Complex search tasks—such as those from the Search as Learning ( SAL ) domain—often result in users developing an information need composed of several aspects . However , current models of searcher behaviour assume that individuals have an atomic need , regardless of the task . While these models generally work well for simpler informational needs , we argue that searcher models need to be developed further to allow for the decomposition of a complex search task into multiple as - pects . As no searcher model yet exists that considers both aspects and the SAL domain , we propose , by augmenting the Complex Searcher Model ( CSM ) , the Subtopic Aware Complex Searcher Model ( SACSM ) —modelling aspects as subtopics to the user’s need . We then instantiate several agents ( i . e . , simulated users ) , with diﬀerent subtopic selection strategies , which can be considered as diﬀerent prototypical learning strategies ( e . g . , should I deeply examine one subtopic at a time , or shallowly cover several subtopics ? ) . Finally , we report on the ﬁrst large - scale simulated analy - sis of user behaviours in the SAL domain . Results demonstrate that the SACSM , under certain conditions , simulates user behaviours accurately . 1 Introduction Over the years , a series of models 1 that describe searcher behaviour have been deﬁned [ 7 , 8 , 23 ] . These often provide a post - hoc explanation of—and reasoning behind—the actions of a searcher during information seeking . One of the main drawbacks of such models is their lack of predictive capabilities : we can neither use these models to investigate what is likely to occur in diﬀerent instantiations of a retrieval system ; nor can we use them for simulating user behaviour . Indeed , models examining searcher behaviours with predictive power [ 2 , 3 , 17 ] have only recently been explored in the ﬁeld of Interactive Information Retrieval ( IIR ) . Such models enable us to relate changing costs ( e . g . , the cost of examin - ing a document ) to changing searcher behaviours . Prior works employing these models have investigated how searchers interact with ranked lists [ 35 ] , the im - pact of diﬀerent browsing costs on a searcher’s behaviour [ 5 , 22 ] , and stopping 1 In this paper , we refer to a model as a model of user behaviour . This research has been supported by NWO projects SearchX ( 639 . 022 . 722 ) and Aspasia ( 015 . 013 . 027 ) . a r X i v : 2201 . 11181v1 [ c s . I R ] 26 J a n 2022 2 A . Cˆamara , D . Maxwell and C . Hauﬀ behaviours on Search Engine Results Pages ( SERPs ) [ 31 , 56 ] . Search topics are usually considered atomic in all of these prior works , with a simple informa - tion need . That is , over a search session 2 , a single topic is considered—with retrieved documents considered to be either relevant or non - relevant to that one topic . These works do not consider the diﬀerent aspects that may constitute a wider topic . In this work , we introduce the ﬁrst model of user behaviour that incorporates such thinking . More speciﬁcally , we take as a starting point the Complex Searcher Model ( CSM ) [ 30 ] , a model that considers a user’s interactions throughout a search session ( over multiple queries ) , and extend it to yield the Subtopic - Aware Complex Searcher Model ( SACSM ) —which , by considering the aspects as subtopics of a larger information need , models : ( i ) subtopic selection ; and ( ii ) subtopic switching steps in the search process . With the SACSM , we explore the eﬀect of diﬀerent subtopic switching strate - gies for multiple types of users within a particular domain to ground our work . We consider Search as Learning ( SAL ) , deﬁned by Marchionini [ 26 ] , as an it - erative process whereby learners engage by reading , scanning and processing a large number of documents retrieved by a search system . Here , the goal is to gain knowledge about a speciﬁc learning objective . With web search engines having become an essential resource for learners [ 15 ] , it is therefore vital to provide support to learners ( e . g . , through the form of novel interface designs [ 10 , 45 , 47 ] or rankers optimised for human learning [ 49 ] ) that help improve their learning eﬃciency while searching . As a learner’s complex information needs can often be decomposed into several subtopics , a natural question to ask is how searchers should tackle the diﬀerent subtopics to learn eﬃciently . To answer this question , we present an exploratory study of the SACSM where we simulate diﬀerent types of learners as agents 3 , and compare these to each other , examining the eﬀect their search behaviour has on their ability to dis - cover documents containing important keywords , as well as how they navigate throughout the subtopic space . We instantiate a series of agents that subscribe to the SACSM —with four tunable parameters that control their simulated searching behaviour : ( i ) learning speed ( λ ) , or how fast agents incorporate novel terms into their vocabulary ; ( ii ) exploration ( ξ ) , or how willing agents are to explore each subtopic ; ( iii ) tolerance ( τ ) , or how willing an agent is to click on a search result snippet ; and ( iv ) subtopic switching ( ϕ ) , the strategy that agents em - ploy to navigate through subtopics . As such , we present the ﬁrst SAL study that employs simulation to examine the search behaviours of learners . By grounding a series of simulated agents with interaction data from a prior user study , we run extensive simulations of interaction to address the following research question : RQ How do subtopic switching ( ϕ ) strategies for learning - oriented search tasks aﬀect the search behaviour of simulated agents ? 2 We consider a search session as interactions with a search interface , which can in - clude the issuing of multiple queries—and the examination of multiple documents . 3 Agents are simulated users that are able to make judgements as to the rele - vancy / attractiveness of information without recourse to relevance information [ 29 ] . SAL and Subtopic Ordering : A Simulation - based Analysis 3 To answer RQ , we measure behaviours by tracking how speciﬁc measures— the number of keywords found , the order of keywords found , and subtopic explo - ration —evolve over an agent’s search sessions . We argue that to be considered eﬀective , a strategy should allow an agent to : ( i ) discover as many keywords as possible in the early stages of the session ; and ( ii ) help the agent to complete the subtopic space exploration in as few steps as possible . The main ﬁndings of our work are : ( i ) subtopic switching strategies that prioritise ordering in the subtopic picking process yield improved discovery of keywords and exploration of subtopics ; and ( ii ) the SACSM is enough to instanti - ate agents that display behaviour similar to real - world learners in a SAL context . Findings suggest that the SACSM is a high - quality model that provides a solid step in approximating searcher behaviours in the SAL domain . This is vital for works that rely on large - scale simulations , such as reinforcement learning for training new rankers optimised for human learning , as well as quickly evaluating new interfaces and algorithmic changes cheaply—all in a simulated environment . 2 Related Work Models of Searcher Behaviour Models of searcher behaviour typically fall into one of two categories : ( i ) descriptive models [ 7 , 16 , 20 , 23 , 43 ] , allowing us to gain an intuition about the search process ; and ( ii ) models that are expressed in more formal ( mathematical ) language [ 2 , 6 , 11 , 17 , 52 , 53 ] . The latter category of model provides predictive power about why users behave in a certain way . As such , they can be used as the basis of simulations of interaction [ 4 ] . Here , a model of searcher behaviour that provides a credible approximation of reality can be used to ground simulations to examine what may happen under under given circumstances . Despite the advantages that simulations provide , formulating such descrip - tive models is non - trivial . Contemporary SERPs for example are complex user interfaces , with new components ( e . g . , entity cards [ 37 ] ) added all the time . In contrast , searcher models typically assume a simple SERP in the format of the traditional ten blue links [ 18 ] . Numerous studies have been undertaken on this more simplistic design , such as the cost of scrolling [ 1 , 5 , 42 ] , typing [ 12 , 40 ] or response time lag [ 28 , 48 ] . Subtopics The Information Retrieval ( IR ) community primarily considers the notion of subtopics from a system - centred point of view , with prior works focus - ing on ranking functions optimised for subtopic retrieval and result diversiﬁca - tion [ 13 , 21 , 38 , 57 , 58 ] . Automatic subtopic ( structure ) extraction has also been investigated , generally based on a given starting query or document [ 19 , 51 ] . The inﬂuence of subtopic characteristics on users has not been frequented in IIR . One exception is by Cˆamara et al . [ 10 ] , who provided study participants with a list of subtopics and ( visual ) indicators about the extent of their subtopic exploration . The impact of subtopic ordering on users was not investigated . 4 A . Cˆamara , D . Maxwell and C . Hauﬀ SAL We ground our work in the domain of learning which has attracted con - siderable attention in recent years . Beyond studies investigating how learning - oriented searches are conducted [ 15 , 36 ] and how to measure learning occurring in search sessions [ 9 , 15 , 55 ] , multiple recent studies have investigated the im - pact of certain user characteristics and user actions on learning during search sessions—examples include the impact of domain knowledge [ 39 , 54 ] , source selec - tion strategies [ 25 ] , and the cognitive abilities of users [ 41 ] . While observational studies are numerous , works proposing novel retrieval algorithms [ 49 ] and novel interface elements [ 10 , 47 ] to support learning whilst searching remain sparse . 3 Subtopic - Aware Complex Searcher Model ( SACSM ) For our study , we augment the CSM [ 32 , 33 ] to be subtopic - aware , turning it into the SACSM . The CSM is a conceptual model of the IIR process ( or a search session ) , describing the ﬂow of activities and decisions that a searcher undertakes when interacting with a search engine . The CSM is built on the work of other conceptual models of the IIR process , such as the models of Baskaya et al . [ 6 ] and Thomas et al . [ 52 ] . Conceptual models provide us with the necessary scaﬀolding from which we can expand and develop the model further for a SAL context—and instantiate the model in such a way that we can run our simulations of interaction [ 4 ] . The SACSM is illustrated in Fig . 1 ; it includes a series of additional activi - ties and decision points ( compared to CSM ) pertaining to the idea of subtopic selection , with novel components highlighted in blue . Key activities are rep - resented as boxes , with key decision points undertaken by subscribing agents represented as diamonds . Upon starting at , a user ( or , in the case of a simulation , an agent ) following the SACSM will ﬁrst examine the given topic A . SACSM then directs the agent to examine a list of the provided subtopics B for the given topic , before then deciding what subtopic C to examine in detail . From here , the agent will consider a number of potential queries D to issue pertaining to the selected subtopic , before selecting a query E to issue F . The agent will then obtain an ‘overview’ of the SERP G , and decide whether to enter it [ 31 ] H —and if they do , they begin to examine a snippet I . If the present snippet is suﬃciently attractive J , the agent will click the associated link K , and assess the document L for usefulness and / or rele - vancy , before deciding to continue on the SERP M ( and examining further snippets if so ) . If not , the decision to continue with the current subtopic N is then made . If this is the case , further queries are issued E —meaning that the snippet and document examination activities are repeated for the results of the new query . This also means that subtopic exploration can entail multiple queries . If the agent instead decides to abandon the subtopic N , they must then decide whether to stop the search session O altogether . This process is repeated until all subtopics have been exhausted by the agent P , or some other condition is met—such as running out of session time .

Fig . 1 : The Subtopic - Aware Complex Searcher Model ( SACSM ) . Changes from the CSM are highlighted in blue . Refer to § 3 for more about the sequence and shapes . Note that compared to previous instantiations of the CSM [ 30 – 33 ] , we have removed activities and decision points about assessing documents for relevance . Unlike simple search sessions , with atomic information needs , a SAL task gener - ally has a more complex and nuanced need [ 15 ] . Therefore , we are interested in examining the content of retrieved documents ( and thus learning from them ) — not simply whether the documents themselves are considered relevant , as has been the norm for prior simulations of interaction [ 27 ] . In order to keep track of terms / concepts that are examined by agents sub - scribing to the SACSM ( as vocabulary learning is a typical manner to measure learning gains in SAL [ 10 , 46 , 50 ] ) , we must also incorporate some type of state within it . This state model was considered in the study by Maxwell and Az - zopardi [ 30 , Fig . 3 ] through the User State Model ( USM ) , which “represents the user’s cognitive state” . Instead of representing the USM as a global , session - based model accumulating state and knowledge of the information examined , we consider a state model for the individual subtopics examined by agents . Each subtopic state consists of a representation of the terms observed by the agent to help them identify fundamental terms about the subtopic , which is used for query generation and determining what snippets ( based on the snippet text provided by the underlying retrieval system ) should be clicked on , with the cor - responding document examined in more detail . Agents following this model only accrue knowledge when examining documents in full , deterministically deduc - ing whether a document is worth examining without recourse to any relevance judgements . The state model is updated at points represented by in Fig . 1 . 6 A . Cˆamara , D . Maxwell and C . Hauﬀ 4 Experimental Method In this section , we describe the details of our instantiation of the SACSM and our simulations . We start by deﬁning how we instantiate each of the components of the SACSM from Fig . 1 , dividing them between ﬁxed ( i . e . , no diﬀerence between agents ) and variable components ( i . e . , changes between each agent ) . By tweaking the variable components , we can instantiate agents that simulate users with diﬀerent characteristics . For example , an agent with a high λ ( how fast am I at learning new terms ? ) , low ξ ( how much content should I explore ? ) and low τ ( how liberal am I at clicking links ? ) simulates a learner that can quickly absorb new concepts , while only skimming through documents and clicking on almost all documents presented to them . We also outline our search setup , our simulation setup , as well as the datasets , and topics ( and subtopics ! ) used . 4 . 1 Fixed SACSM Components We instantiate the SACSM in various ways to evaluate how diﬀerent subtopic switching strategies performed for diﬀerent types of users . Although the SACSM has many activities and decision points to instantiate , we ﬁxed a number of these to reduce the space that we were required to examine . Query Generation We use the QS 3 + querying strategy proposed by Maxwell and Azzopardi [ 30 ] , where three query terms are selected from a language model learned from the documents the agent has already explored ( plus the topic de - scription ) . Previous user studies in the SAL domain [ 10 , 47 ] have shown that three query terms per query is reasonable , and close to what real - world searchers use . SERP Examination Considered by Maxwell and Azzopardi [ 31 ] , SERP ex - amination strategies provide users with the ability to survey a SERP before committing to examining it in detail . Here , We choose to reduce the complexity of our agents ( and explored space ) and use the Always Examine approach— agents always enter the SERP and examine at least one result snippet . User Interaction Costs To realistically mimic how long agents should spend on each phase of their search process , we present in Table 1 the costs ( in seconds ) from the interaction data of a prior user study [ 10 ] . Note the high document examination cost—as participants of the user study were attempting to formulate ideas about concepts , they spent on average longer on documents when compared to other , non - SAL based studies ( e . g . , [ 31 ] ) . We also note that the total session times inﬂuence the stopping behaviours of agents since , when agents reach the time limit of their sessions , they automatically stop—regardless of the number of remaining queries to be issued , as generated by the QS 3 + strategy . Snippet - Level Stopping Strategies Diﬀerent snippet - level stopping strategies can be employed , generally classiﬁed between ﬁxed ( i . e . , the agent will evaluate snippets until a certain depth ) or adaptive strategies ( i . e . , the number of snippets SAL and Subtopic Ordering : A Simulation - based Analysis 7 Table 1 : Interaction costs grounding our agents , as derived from Cˆamara et al .

For our agents , we use only a ﬁxed snippet - level stopping strategy , where agents examine snippets to a depth of 10 . This is a reasonable depth to examine to , and avoids issues with SERP pagination . 4 . 2 Variable SACSM Components For this study , agents can be instantiated using four variables , according to the type of user to be simulated . An overview of these variables is presented in Fig . 2 . Subtopic Switching ( ϕ ) We propose four diﬀerent strategies for agents to se - lect and switch between subtopics during their search sessions . These implement the Select Subtopic decision point , as shown in Fig . 1 . To determine whether agents have explored a subtopic suﬃciently , we use a method similar to the ap - proach outlined by Cˆamara et al . [ 10 ] for tracking subtopic exploration . Each clicked document is embedded using SBERT [ 44 ] and compared—using the dot product—to pre - computed embeddings for each subtopic of the current topic , as extracted from their Wikipedia articles 4 . Therefore , each document clicked by an agent will update an internal state tracker for each subtopic , summing how much the agent ‘explored’ each subtopic . We evaluate four strategies . – Greedy For this strategy , an agent examines each subtopic in turn , accord - ing to the order provided by the respective Wikipedia article , only deciding to move to the next subtopic when they have achieved a certain level of progress . Intuitively , this would be the most rational type of user , since they follow a subtopic ordering that is optimised for human understanding ( i . e . , the order comes from a Wikipedia page ) . In other words , they will attempt to master one subtopic before moving to the next ( prescribed ) topic . – Greedy - Skip Instead of the above , an agent subscribing to Greedy - Skip moves to the next subtopic with the next lowest completion value . This in - stantiated agent attempts to minimise the number of documents to be read by querying in a domain with lesser knowledge . – Reverse This strategy is similar to Greedy , but the agent examines the subtopics in reverse order as presented from the corresponding Wikipedia 4 Refer to § 4 . 3 for more information on the use of Wikipedia articles . 8 A .

The rationale here is that an agent attempts to game the system by ﬁrst learning the most complex subtopics before moving to easier ones . – Random This strategy randomly selects a new subtopic after each query , with no predeﬁned order . This strategy models a non - rational learner , and serves as a lower bound for our experiments . Learning Speed ( λ ) This parameter is the same λ from the language model proposed by Maxwell and Azzopardi [ 30 ] . It controls how much an agent relies on their acquired knowledge ( i . e . , novel terms ) when considering if a given snippet should be clicked or not . The language model is updated every time the agent clicks on a relevant snippet . In addition , a Maximum Likelihood Estimator [ 34 ] is used for deciding if a given snippet is attractive or not . An agent with a low λ gives lower weights to terms learned during the session , simulating a slow learner . An agent with a higher λ , in turn , mimics a user that quickly incorporate new terms , being a fast learner . In our simulations , we use λ ∈ [ 0 . 1 , 0 . 4 , 0 . 8 ] . Exploration ( ξ ) This parameter controls how much the agent should explore a subtopic before being satisﬁed by what it has ‘learnt’ . A lower number implies that such an agent that is only ‘skimming’ trough the topic , inspecting only a few documents per subtopic . In contrast , a higher value implies that such an agent is willing to explore deeper within each subtopic . For the simulations reported in this paper , we trial ξ ∈ [ 2 . 0 , 6 . 0 , 10 . 0 ] . Tolerance ( τ ) Finally , this parameter is the threshold that controls how attrac - tive a snippet should be to be clicked [ 34 ] . An agent with low τ is a strict clicker , clicking on fewer , ‘safer’ snippets , while a higher τ implies a liberal clicker agent , more willing to explore . In our simulations , we trial τ ∈ [ 0 . 0 , 1 . 0 , 3 . 0 , 5 . 0 ] . 4 . 3 Simulation Setup The setup of our experiments follows that of the user study presented by Cˆamara et al . [ 10 ] . Here , we use the same eight topics extracted from the TREC CAR 2017 dataset [ 14 ] , as shown in Table 2 . Subtopics were also derived from the TREC CAR dataset : they were extracted from ﬁrst - level headings of the respective Wikipedia articles as they were in December 2017—the dataset’s creation .

We used a manually curated blocklist 5 of URLs serving Wiki - style clones to ﬁlter results returned from the Bing API to prevent agents from encountering a single page that would give them all the information on all subtopics at once . This encourages agents to examine multiple documents and issue multiple queries to ﬁnd information pertinent to their learning task . To match with our stopping strategy ( see § 4 . 1 ) , 10 results per page were presented to agents . 5 Results By combining all values of ξ , λ , τ and ϕ , we instantiate 144 unique agents ( using a modiﬁed version SimIIR [ 30 ] ) , and run each agent over all of the topics shown in Table 2 . Our version of SimIIR —together with the raw out - puts of our simulations—are available at https : / / github . com / ArthurCamara / simiir _ subtopics / . With some methods being non - deterministic , each agent was run ten times—with the average reported . In total , we ran a total of 11 , 520 simulations . We show representative examples for each set of measures . In all plots , the x axes denote how many documents the agent examined during a search session . While values on y axes may seem low , they are averaged over a large number of simulations with varying degrees of complexity . Table 3 shows the average value for key measures over all agents of each ϕ , over the eight topics . In the ﬁrst row , we also show the measures from the FEEDBACKSC cohort from Cˆamara et al . [ 10 ] . Our simulated agents are similar on these measures compared to how real - world learners would behave , with a similar number of queries , snippets examined , and documents clicked . While a high deviation is expected , recall that this is an average of 288 agents with a large variation on their parameters ( compared to only 36 real - world learners ) . Results show that our agents are indeed similar to real - world learners . To address RQ , we break down our analysis further into three sub - questions . 5 https : / / github . com / ArthurCamara / CHIIR21 - SAL - Scaffolding / blob / master / data / blocklist . txt ( All URLs last accessed January 18 th , 2022 . ) 10 A .

How many keywords can the agents ﬁnd ? To measure how well the agents can ﬁnd documents with a high concentration of potentially valuable keywords 6 , we extracted ten keywords for each subtopic from their respective paragraphs from the topic’s Wikipedia article . 7 To do this , we begin by ranking all terms from their portions of the articles ( excluding stopwords ) by their TF - IDF , with the IDF computed over the whole TREC CAR Wikipedia dump—and select - ing the top 10 terms as keywords . We use this subtopic - wise approach ( instead of extracting keywords from the whole article ) to ensure a fair distribution of keywords over all subtopics , providing a less biased overview of how the agent is performing over the topic . Therefore , each topic has a diﬀerent number of keywords , reﬂected by the number of subtopics it contains . Table 2 shows how many subtopics and unique keywords each topic contains . This setup is similar to previous SAL user studies [ 10 , 46 , 47 ] , where study participants were asked to deﬁne a list of concepts before and after their search session to evaluate their knowledge gain . We can mimic this setup throughout the entirety of an agent’s search session by requiring the keyword to appear at least a few times ( in our case , ﬁve ) in the documents ‘read’ by the agent . 6 As noted in § 3 , we do not have explicit relevance judgements . 7 As an example , the following are extracted keywords for the topic Ethics : ethical , ontology , propositions , consequentialism , normative and principles .

For two agents , Fig . 3 shows how many keywords each approach for ϕ dis - covers during their search sessions after reading a certain number of documents . At the beginning of the search sessions , we observed that agents instantiated with Greedy and Greedy - Skip strategies found keywords faster than agents with Random or Reverse . However , this diﬀerence diminishes over time . This is expected , since the subtopics ordering comes from Wikipedia articles , which are optimised for human understanding . Therefore , an agent that searches for subtopics in order has a higher probability of encountering documents with a higher number of keywords earlier in the session when compared with one that does not . We can also note that Random with higher τ found more unique keywords in total , given their high probability of clicking in any document . Are the agents exploring enough of the subtopics ? Another way to mea - sure how the agents behave is by investigating how their internal Subtopic Track - ers evolve during the session ( as explained in § 3 ) . If an agent can reach ξ for a given subtopic in a few documents , we can infer that they could quickly ﬁnd documents related to that subtopic . Fig . 4 shows a similar trend to that observed previously , with agents using Greedy and Greedy - Skip strategies clicking on documents that advance their internal tracking faster . This implies that these strategies eﬀectively lead the agents towards better documents faster . Are the agents following the order of the subtopics ? While the previous measures show that the agents are indeed eﬀective in ﬁnding documents related to the topic , they fail to incorporate another essential learning feature , namely that keywords have dependencies between them . We assume that , for an agent to comprehend what a keyword means entirely , they have to comprehend at least some other , more basic concepts related to the topic at hand . Therefore , an agent that can ﬁnd documents so that they will encounter more primary keywords for the topic ( i . e . , that appear earlier in the Wikipedia article ) earlier in the session before facing more complex keywords ( i . e . , that appear later in the Wikipedia article ) is more desirable for a SAL environment . As an example , consider the keyword consequentialist for the topic Ethics . Before an agent can adequately understand what it means in this context , they probably need to understand other concepts , like virtue and morality . Therefore , for this analysis , 12 A .

To account for possible noises in our keyword extraction method , we deﬁne this number as 50 % of the keywords seen prior to the current one ( e . g . , the keyword consequentialist is the 19 th out of 49 keywords to appear in the list of extracted terms for the topic Ethics ) . Therefore , we only consider a given keyword as learned after the agent has learned at least 30 % of the prior terms . 8 As seen in Fig . 5 , we see similar behaviour to the one observed above , with Greedy and Greedy - Skip outperforming Random and Reverse , with the diﬀerence slowly disappearing throughout the search session . Again , almost all agents repeat this behaviour . These results show that our simulations are close to real users and that there is a clear diﬀerence between strategies , with Greedy and Greedy - Skip following the logical structure of the subtopics , and generally being better strategies for agents exploring the subtopic space . Consequently , these should be taken into account when simulating agents for SAL scenarios . 6 Conclusions We have proposed a novel user model for simulating agents focused on SAL tasks : the Subtopic - Aware Complex Searcher Model , SACSM . Recalling our original re - search question which considered how diﬀerent subtopic switching strategies ( ϕ ) aﬀected the behaviour or simulated agents , we show that strategies that mimic a rational user ( i . e . , Greedy and Greedy - Skip ) are more eﬀective at ﬁnding keywords , exploring subtopics and following subtopic structure when compared to other strategies . With 1 , 520 simulations , our study is the ﬁrst ( to the best of our knowledge ) that focuses on simulated agents for Search as Learning , en - abling future works in both SAL and IIR that may require large quantities of user data , such as Reinforcement Learning models and studies on how changes in the search system may impact the behaviour of learners . To further help re - search eﬀorts , we also make public our implementation of the SACSM , built on top of the already established SimIIR framework . 8 This number was decided experimentally , as it showed to be the best to distinguish between the diﬀerent methods trialled .
