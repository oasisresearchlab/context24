Quantification of IgA and IgG Abs in saliva allows studies of the mucosal and systemic immune response after natural infection or vaccination . We developed and validated an enzyme immunoassay ( EIA ) to detect and quantify salivary IgA and IgG Abs against the prefusion - stabilized form of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) spike protein expressed in suspension - adapted HEK - 293 cells . Normalization against total Ab isotype was performed to account for specimen differences , such as collection time and sample volume . Saliva samples collected from 187 SARS - CoV - 2 confirmed cases enrolled in 2 cohorts and 373 prepandemic saliva samples were tested . The sensitivity of both EIAs was high ( IgA , 95 . 5 % ; IgG , 89 . 7 % ) without compromising specificity ( IgA , 99 % ; IgG , 97 % ) . No cross - reactivity with endemic coronaviruses was observed . The limit of detection for SARS - CoV - 2 salivary IgA and IgG assays were 1 . 98 ng / ml and 0 . 30 ng / ml , respectively . Salivary IgA and IgG Abs were detected earlier in patients with mild COVID - 19 symptoms than in severe cases . However , severe cases showed higher salivary Ab titers than those with a mild infection . Salivary IgA titers quickly decreased after 6 wk in mild cases but remained detectable until at least week 10 in severe cases . Salivary IgG titers remained high for all patients , regardless of disease severity . In conclusion , EIAs for both IgA and IgG had high specificity and sensitivity for the confirmation of current or recent SARS - CoV - 2 infections and evaluation of the IgA and IgG immune response . The Journal of Immunology , 2022 , 208 : 1500 (cid:1) 1508 . S evere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) , the causative agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) pandemic , is a betacoronavirus related to SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( MERS - CoV ) ( 1 (cid:1) 3 ) . As of July 30 , 2021 , SARS - CoV - 2 infections had caused more than 200 million cases worldwide and an estimated 4 . 2 million deaths . The clinical spectrum of SARS - CoV - 2 infection ranges from asymptomatic infection to symptomatic disease ( 4 ) . The high proportion of asymptomatic individuals not only results in a high transmission rate but also suggests differences in the host immune response compared with other coronaviruses ( 5 ) . Because the duration of immunity to SARS - CoV - 2 dictates the overall course of the pandemic as well as postpandemic strategies , a comprehen - sive understanding of the relationship between systemic and muco - sal Ab responses becomes important . Because the oral and nasal cavities are considered the main sites for SARS - CoV - 2 entry and replication , locally produced mucosal Abs may protect against infection . Therefore , saliva samples can be used as a noninvasive tool for virus detection as well as for measuring the immune response ( mucosal and systemic ) ( 6 ) . Salivary Ab levels can be 100 - to 1000 - fold lower than serum levels ( 7 ) . Salivary IgG is mainly derived from serum by leakage across capillaries and enters saliva through gingival crevices . At mucosal membranes , IgA is the main Ig class and is found most often in the secretory form . Within 2 (cid:1) 3 wk after onset of disease , SARS - CoV - 2 (cid:1) speci ﬁ c IgG Abs can be detected in saliva , persist for at least 9 mo , and show high correlation with serum Ab levels in most patients with COVID - 19 ( 8 (cid:1) 11 ) . Salivary IgA Abs , on the contrary , rapidly increase 1 wk after onset of disease , become unde - tectable 4 (cid:1) 5 wk later , and show a moderate correlation with serum levels ( 8 , 9 ) . Saliva provides a noninvasive collection method that is easy to implement in remote areas and community settings without a need for extensive training . These features , while additionally evaluating both mucosal and systemic immune responses , make * Division of Viral Diseases , National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Dis - eases , Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , Atlanta , GA ; † Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education , Oak Ridge , TN ; ‡ Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology , Oregon Health & Science University , Portland , OR ; x Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion , National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases , Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , Atlanta , GA ; { School of Public Health , Oregon Health & Science University , Portland , OR ; and ‖ Division of Infectious Diseases , Department of Medicine , Oregon Health & Science University , Portland , OR ORCIDs : 0000 - 0002 - 1532 - 4345 ( V .

We previously demonstrated the value of saliva - based Ab assays to evaluate immune responses mounted against norovirus ( 12 ) . In this article , we describe the development and validation of an enzyme immunoassay ( EIA ) to quantitatively evaluate the presence of SARS - CoV - 2 (cid:1) speci ﬁ c IgA and IgG Abs in saliva and to describe the salivary immune response to SARS - CoV - 2 mounted in different cohorts of infected patients . Materials and Methods Saliva samples A total of 333 saliva samples were collected from 187 participants who had positive test results for SARS - CoV - 2 by real - time RT - PCR ( rRT - PCR ) ( 13 ) or Ag test in two cohorts ( Fig . 1 ) . In cohort I , 235 samples were collected from ( 1 ) 113 participants at a single time point and ( 2 ) 32 participants on a weekly basis for 4 (cid:1) 5 wk ( n 5 122 ) after diagnosis . In cohort II , 98 saliva samples were collected from 42 participants with either asymptomatic ( n 5 8 ) , mild ( n 5 29 ) , or severe disease ( n 5 5 ) at different times after the onset of disease ( range , 0 (cid:1) 203 d ) . Disease severity was de ﬁ ned according to the World Health Organization criteria ( 4 ) , and clinical data were obtained using a stan - dardized questionnaire . In addition , 373 prepandemic archived samples col - lected between 2009 and 2010 were included as negative controls ( 12 ) . Specimen collection and processing Saliva was collected at least 30 min after consumption of food or liquids . Prepandemic archived saliva samples were collected using the Oracol saliva collection device , processed , and stored at − 80 ◦ C according to the man - ufacturer ’ s instructions ( Malvern Medical Developments , Worcester , UK ) . Cohort I samples were collected using the Oracol S14 collection device by gently rubbing the swab along the gumline around the entire mouth for ∼ 1 min . This collection device speci ﬁ cally harvests gingival crevicular ﬂ uid , which resembles serum composition ( 14 ) . Saliva samples collected by the Oracol swabs were separated by centrifugation ( 10 min at 1500 × g ) , trans - ferred to the attached microtube ( 10 (cid:1) 200 m l ) , and stored at − 80 ◦ C until analysis . For cohort II , participants were asked to cough deeply and spit into a collection cup containing virus isolation media ( PBS plus 2 % FBS , genta - micin , amphotericin B ) . Saliva samples were clari ﬁ ed by centrifugation ( 10 min at 3000 × g ) , aliquoted , and stored at − 80 ◦ C until analysis . All samples collected during the pandemic were inactivated by g - irradiation ( 2 × 10 6 rad ) before testing ( 15 ) . Samples were initially tested for SARS - CoV - 2 (cid:1) speci ﬁ c salivary IgA . If enough sample volume ( $ 100 m l ) was available , samples were tested for SARS - CoV - 2 (cid:1) speci ﬁ c salivary IgG . EIA for detecting SARS - CoV - 2 (cid:1) specific IgA and IgG in saliva Convalescent sera from three SARS - CoV - 2 cases with IgA and IgG Abs against SARS - CoV - 2 spike protein were used for the initial assay develop - ment . The prefusion stabilized ectodomain of SARS - CoV - 2 spike protein ( Wuhan - Hu - 1 strain ; GenBank MN908947 . 3 ) that was used in the assays was expressed in suspension - adapted HEK - 293 cells as described previously ( 16 ) . Ag concentrations ranging from 0 . 125 to 1 . 00 m g / ml in PBS and 1 : 1 , 000 to 1 : 20 , 000 diluted HRP - conjugated goat anti - human IgA or IgG were initially tested . Positive and negative controls ( SARS - CoV - 2 convales - cent serum and prepandemic saliva samples , respectively ) , as well as blank controls ( only blocking buffer ) , were also included in each run . All volumes were 100 m l per well , except where indicated . All washes were performed three times with 250 m l of PBS with 0 . 05 % Tween 20 using a BioTek 405 plate washer . All dilutions were prepared in blocking buffer ( 5 % w / v pow - dered milk / PBS with 0 . 05 % Tween 20 ) . All incubations were carried out for 1 h at 37 ◦ C except where indicated . All concentrations and incubation times were optimized to maximize the OD difference between prepandemic nega - tive samples and SARS - CoV - 2 convalescent sera . Immunolon 2 HB ﬂ at - bottomed 96 - well plates ( Fisher Scienti ﬁ c ) were coated with 100 m l of SARS - CoV - 2 spike protein ( 0 . 5 m g / ml in PBS , rows A (cid:1) D , positive coated wells ) or PBS ( rows E (cid:1) H , negative coated wells ) and incubated overnight at 4 ◦ C in a humidi ﬁ ed chamber . Plates were washed , then blocked with 200 m l / well blocking buffer for 2 h at 37 ◦ C . After block - ing , plates were washed three times , and fourfold serial dilutions ( 1 : 10 (cid:1) 1 : 160 ) of each saliva sample were added to both Ag - and PBS - coated wells . Plates were incubated and washed , and bound Abs were detected using HRP - conjugated goat anti - human IgA ( SeraCare Life Sciences , Mil - ford , MA ) diluted 1 : 4 , 000 in blocking buffer or anti - IgG ( SeraCare Life Sciences ) diluted 1 : 16 , 000 . After incubation , plates were washed again before 100 m l of 3 , 3 9 , 5 , 5 9 - tetramethylbenzidine substrate ( SeraCare Life Sci - ences ) was added . The colorimetric reaction was stopped 5 min later by add - ing 100 m l of Stop solution ( SeraCare Life Sciences ) . The plates were read at 450 nm and 630 nm using an Epoch2 instrument ( BioTek ) . After back - ground correction ( OD 450nm − OD 630nm ) , the adjusted OD value ( OD value positive coated well minus OD value negative coated well ) was determined . EIA for detecting total IgA and IgG in saliva For the detection of total IgA , Immunolon 2 HB ﬂ at - bottomed 96 - well plates ( Fisher Scienti ﬁ c ) were coated with goat anti - human IgA ( a - chain ) ( 0 . 5 m g / ml in PBS , rows A (cid:1) F , positive coated wells ) or PBS 1 × ( rows G and H , negative coated wells ) and incubated overnight at 4 ◦ C in a humidi ﬁ ed chamber . Plates were washed and blocked with blocking buffer ( 200 m l / well ) for 2 h at 37 ◦ C . Three dilutions ( 1 : 1 , 280 , 1 : 5 , 120 , and 1 : 20 , 480 ) of each saliva sample were prepared . A standard curve for IgA was prepared by serial dilution of puri ﬁ ed human IgA from colostrum ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) . After incubation , plates were washed , and saliva samples were added to rows A (cid:1) D . Puri ﬁ ed human IgA dilutions were added to both positive coated ( anti - IgA , rows E and F ) and negative coated ( PBS , rows G and H ) wells . Plates were incubated and washed , and bound Abs were detected using 1 : 4000 diluted HRP - conju - gated goat anti - human IgA ( SeraCare Life Sciences ) . After incubation , plates were washed again before 3 , 3 9 , 5 , 5 9 - tetramethylbenzidine substrate ( SeraCare Life Sciences ) was added . The colorimetric reaction was stopped 5 min later by adding Stop solution ( SeraCare Life Sciences ) . After background correc - tion , the adjusted OD values were calculated as described above . The same plate design and steps were used for IgG . Plates were coated with goat anti - human IgG ( g - chain ) at 0 . 5 m g / ml in PBS . A standard curve for IgG was prepared by serial dilutions of puri ﬁ ed human IgG ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , and bound Abs were detected using 1 : 16 , 000 diluted HRP - conju - gated goat anti - human IgG ( SeraCare Life Sciences ) . After background cor - rection , the adjusted OD values were calculated as described above . Clinical sensitivity and specificity The sensitivity ( ability to identify samples with Abs to SARS - CoV - 2 ) and the speci ﬁ city ( ability to identify samples without Abs to SARS - CoV - 2 ) were de ﬁ ned as the values for which there is 95 % probability that the estimated value can be obtained ( 17 ) . For IgA EIA validation , 373 SARS - CoV - 2 rRT - PCR negative saliva samples ( prepandemic ) collected from healthy adults ( 2009 (cid:1) 2010 ) and 44 saliva samples from SARS - CoV - 2 rRT - PCR - con - ﬁ rmed cases were used . Similarly , for validation of the IgG assay , 373 pre - pandemic saliva samples and 68 saliva samples from con ﬁ rmed cases were used . Saliva samples were collected from 0 to 63 d after diagnosis . Limit of detection The limit of detection ( LOD ) was de ﬁ ned as the lowest predicted value for which there is 95 % probability that an estimated value can be obtained . To determine the LOD for the IgA ( or IgG ) EIA , ﬁ ve IgA ( or IgG ) positive SARS - CoV - 2 saliva samples were fourfold serially diluted ( 1 : 10 (cid:1) 1 : 10 , 240 ) . The adjusted OD values were extrapolated from the linear portion of the IgA ( or IgG ) standard curve . The LOD was determined from the lowest concen - tration of Ab above the cutoff value ( mean of the adjusted OD values for the prepandemic samples 1 3 SD ) . Analytical specificity To evaluate potential cross - reactivity between Abs against the spike protein of SARS - CoV - 2 and other human coronaviruses , serum samples ( n 5 12 ) were selected from a SARS - CoV - 2 household transmission study performed during 2020 ( 18 ) . Participants ’ ages ranged from 1 to 67 y , and reactivity to each endemic coronavirus spike protein ( HCoV 229E , HCoV NL - 63 , HCoV OC43 , and HCoV HUK1 ) was evaluated using the V - PLEX COVID - 19 Coronavirus Panel 2 Kit ( Meso Scale Diagnostics , Rockville , MD ) . Data analysis Descriptive statistics for continuous variables are presented as median with interquartile range ( IQR ) . For categorical variables , number ( percent ) was used for descriptive statistics , and differences were evaluated by x 2 test or Fisher exact test . Nonparametric data from more than two groups were com - pared by Kruskal - Wallis test . Receiver operating characteristic ( ROC ) curve analysis was used to evaluate the sensitivity and speci ﬁ city of each assay when establishing a cutoff for positivity . Each saliva sample was tested at two different dilutions . To quantify total and SARS - CoV - 2 (cid:1) speci ﬁ c Abs , adjusted OD values from serially diluted puri ﬁ ed human IgA ( or IgG ) were plotted against concentration and ﬁ t to a sigmoidal four - parameter logistic model . Total and SARS - CoV - 2 (cid:1) speci ﬁ c salivary IgA ( or IgG ) titers were extrapolated from the linear portion of the IgA ( or IgG ) standard curve .

When virus - speci ﬁ c Abs could not be detected but total Abs were detected , SARS - CoV - 2 (cid:1) speci ﬁ c IgA ( or IgG ) per 100 m g of total IgA ( or IgG ) was arbitrarily assigned as half the lower LOD , based on the standard curve of puri ﬁ ed human IgA ( 19 ) . Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism version 8 . 0 ( GraphPad Software , La Jolla , CA ) , and p values < 0 . 05 were considered signi ﬁ cant .

Results We developed and validated EIAs for the quantitative detection of SARS - CoV - 2 (cid:1) speci ﬁ c IgA and IgG Abs in saliva . The ﬁ nal assay conditions are summarized in Table I . Prepandemic saliva ( negative for SARS - CoV - 2 Abs ) and convalescent serum from COVID - 19 patients were used for the initial standardization of both EIAs . All reagent concentrations ( SARS - CoV - 2 spike protein , anti - human IgA [ a - chain ] or IgG [ g - chain ] , HRP - labeled secondary Ab , puri ﬁ ed human IgA , and puri ﬁ ed human IgG concentration for standard curves ) and incubation times were optimized to reduce background , obtain maximum anti - SARS - CoV - 2 (cid:1) speci ﬁ c signal , and maximize the OD difference between prepandemic negative samples and SARS - CoV - 2 convalescent sera . Clinical sensitivity and specificity A dilution of 1 : 10 of true negative ( prepandemic ) and true positive ( SARS - CoV - 2 rRT - PCR (cid:1) con ﬁ rmed cases ) ( Fig . 1 ) saliva samples resulted in OD values with no background signal in the negative coated wells ( PBS coat ) . Adjusted OD values for both SARS - CoV - 2 (cid:1) speci ﬁ c IgA and IgG Abs from true - positive samples were signif - icantly higher in saliva from rRT - PCR con ﬁ rmed cases than in that from prepandemic samples ( Fig . 2A ; p < 0 . 0001 ) . ROC curve anal - ysis was applied to determine the cutoff value that maximizes sensi - tivity and speci ﬁ city ( Fig . 2B and 2C ) . For the IgA EIA , the assay speci ﬁ city improved from 91 . 5 % ( 95 % con ﬁ dence interval [ CI ] , 88 . 2 (cid:1) 93 . 9 % ) to 97 . 3 % ( 95 % CI , 95 . 0 (cid:1) 98 . 5 % ) when the cutoff value increased from 1 to 3 SD above the mean ( ¯ x ) of the prepan - demic samples , whereas the sensitivity remained at 95 . 5 % ( 95 % CI , 84 . 9 (cid:1) 99 . 2 % ) . For the IgG EIA , a signi ﬁ cant increase of the speci ﬁ c - ity from 97 . 9 % ( 95 % CI , 96 . 6 (cid:1) 99 . 3 % ) to 98 . 9 % ( 95 % CI , 97 . 3 (cid:1) 99 . 6 % ) ( p < 0 . 05 ) was achieved when the cutoff value was modi ﬁ ed from ¯ x 1 SD to ¯ x 1 3 SD . Although the sensitivity slightly decreased from 91 . 2 % ( 95 % CI , 82 . 1 (cid:1) 95 . 9 % ) to 89 . 7 % ( 95 % CI , 80 . 2 (cid:1) 94 . 9 % ) , this difference was not signi ﬁ cant ( p 5 0 . 0625 ) . On the basis of these data , we used a cutoff value of ¯ x 1 3 SD of the adjusted OD values from prepandemic saliva samples for both the IgA and IgG EIAs . The overall diagnostic accuracy was 98 . 3 % ( 95 % CI , 95 . 6 (cid:1) 100 % ) and 99 . 1 % ( 95 % CI , 98 . 0 (cid:1) 100 % ) for the IgA and IgG assays , respectively ( Table I ) . We also determined if there was any impact on the sensitivity and overall diagnostic accuracy of each assay based on the collec - tion method . Although a slight increase in both parameters was observed for the IgA assay when using passive drools as a collection device and for the IgG assay when collecting samples with Oracol swabs , none of these differences ( swabs versus passive drools or swabs versus passive drools versus both together ) were signi ﬁ cant ( data not shown ) . LOD For both IgA and IgG Ab assays , a sigmoidal four - parameter logis - tic curve was ﬁ tted to the resulting adjusted OD values to yield a standard curve of Ab concentration versus OD ( Fig . 2D ) . The lower LODs for the assays were 1 . 98 ng / ml for SARS - CoV - 2 IgA Abs and 0 . 3 ng / ml for SARS - CoV - 2 IgG Abs . At the upper limits of quanti ﬁ cation , above which the detectors on the plate reader for IgA and IgG Abs are saturated , samples were tested at higher dilutions ( > 1 : 1280 ) for total Abs to ﬁ t within the linear portion of the sigmoi - dal curve and without compromising the detection of Abs against SARS - CoV - 2 . We tested three dilutions for SARS - CoV - 2 and total Abs ( Table I ) . At 1 : 10 dilution , 42 saliva samples had positive test results for SARS - CoV - 2 IgA , whereas at 1 : 40 and 1 : 160 dilutions , 16 of 42 ( 38 % ) and 25 of 42 ( 59 % ) false - negative test results were detected . For total IgA Abs , 10 of 42 ( 24 % ) saliva samples were above the upper limit of quanti ﬁ cation at 1 : 1 , 280 dilution , whereas at 1 : 5 , 024 dilution , 42 of 42 ( 100 % ) were detected , and at 1 : 20 , 480 dilution , 2 of 42 ( 5 % ) false - negative test results were detected . At 1 : 10 dilution , 60 saliva samples had positive test results for SARS - CoV - 2 IgG , whereas at 1 : 40 and 1 : 160 dilutions , 33 of 60 ( 55 % ) and 40 of 60 ( 67 % ) false - negative test results were detected . For total IgG Abs , 12 of 60 ( 20 % ) saliva samples were above the upper limit of quanti ﬁ cation at 1 : 1 , 280 dilution , whereas at 1 : 5 , 024 dilu - tion , 60 of 60 ( 100 % ) were detected , and at 1 : 20 , 480 dilution , 7 of 60 ( 12 % ) false - negative test results were detected ( Fig . 2E ) .

Analytical specificity To evaluate the potential cross - reactivity with Abs against endemic coronaviruses ( 229E , HKU1 , OC43 , NL63 ) , serum samples with low , medium , and high reactivity to each endemic coronavirus spike were tested for the presence of SARS - CoV - 2 IgA and IgG ( Fig . 2F and 2G ) . At the lowest serum dilution ( 1 : 100 ) , both SARS - CoV - 2 IgA and IgG adjusted OD values were signi ﬁ cantly lower in endemic coronavirus ( 0 . 039 ± 0 . 023 and 0 . 044 ± 0 . 01 ) serum than in SARS - CoV - 2 serum ( 0 . 742 ± 0 . 133 and 0 . 841 ± 0 . 203 ) ( p < 0 . 0001 ) , suggesting that our assays show no cross - reactivity with Abs against seasonal coronaviruses . Kinetics and magnitude of SARS - CoV - 2 (cid:1) specific Ab response in saliva after infection Cohort I yielded 205 saliva samples from 118 SARS - CoV - 2 con - ﬁ rmed cases available to be tested for SARS - CoV - 2 (cid:1) speci ﬁ c sali - vary IgA and 166 saliva samples for which enough saliva was available were also tested for IgG ( Fig . 1 ) . The mean time between SARS - CoV - 2 diagnosis and saliva collection was 22 . 9 d ( median , 20 d ; IQR , 14 (cid:1) 31 . 75 ; range , 2 (cid:1) 65 d ) . Overall , 86 . 4 % ( 102 of 118 ) of participants had measurable salivary Abs for one ( IgA , 19 . 5 % , n 5 23 of 118 ; IgG , 20 . 3 % , n 5 24 of 118 ) or both isotypes ( 46 . 6 % ; 55 of 118 ) . Conversely , 13 . 6 % ( 16 of 118 ) participants had negative test results for both of SARS - CoV - 2 salivary IgA and IgG . During the ﬁ rst week after diagnosis , the positivity rate for both IgA and IgG was 28 . 6 % ( 2 of 7 samples ) . For IgA , the positivity rate rapidly increased to 62 . 1 % at week 2 , peaked at week 4 ( 68 . 6 % ) , and decreased to 0 % at week 9 and week 10 . At week 3 , the posi - tivity rate for IgG was 80 % , peaked at 100 % at week 8 , and remained positive to the end of the study ( week 10 ) ( Fig . 3A ) . The median amount of SARS - CoV - 2 (cid:1) speci ﬁ c IgA was 0 . 1 ng ( IQR , 0 . 1 (cid:1) 49 . 44 ) / 100 m g of total IgA at week 1 and increased to 7 . 95 ng ( IQR , 0 . 1 (cid:1) 25 . 74 ) / 100 m g of total IgA at week 3 ( IQR , 0 . 1 (cid:1) 25 . 74 ) . After ﬂ uctuating at week 4 and week 6 , the IgA levels became undetectable at week 9 . The salivary IgG titers increased between week 1 ( median , 0 . 1 ng / 100 m g of total IgG ; IQR , 0 . 1 (cid:1) 14 . 32 ) and week 5 ( median , 123 . 4 ng / 100 m g of total IgG ; IQR , 39 . 32 (cid:1) 269 . 5 ) , peaked to 162 . 9 ng ( IQR , 31 . 93 (cid:1) 322 . 9 ) / 100 m g of total IgG at week 6 and then remained stable throughout the follow - up period . Com - pared with week 1 , signi ﬁ cant differences between IgG levels were observed at week 5 ( p < 0 . 05 ) and week 6 ( p < 0 . 01 ) ( Fig . 3B ) . In cohort II , 85 saliva samples from 42 rRT - PCR (cid:1) positive partici - pants who were either asymptomatic ( n 5 8 ) or had mild ( n 5 29 ) or severe ( n 5 5 ) clinical COVID - 19 disease symptoms were tested for IgA and IgG Abs ( Fig . 1 ; Table II ) . In the group of patients with mild symptoms , the mean time between onset of disease and sample collection was 146 . 8 d ( median , 178 ; IQR , 81 . 25 (cid:1) 200 . 8 ; range , 1 (cid:1) 208 d ) and 25 . 6 d ( median , 18 ; IQR , 14 . 5 (cid:1) 40 . 5 ; range , 12 (cid:1) 60 d ) in the group with severe symptoms . Overall , for cohort II , the positivity rate for IgA showed a clear pattern with increasing values during weeks 1 (cid:1) 3 and a peak at week 4 , whereas the positivity rate for IgG was less de ﬁ ned ( Fig . 3C ) . For patients with mild disease symptoms , the positivity rate for IgA and IgG was 33 . 3 % at week 1 after onset of symptoms . The IgA titer rapidly increased and peaked at week 4 ( 100 % ) , sharply decreased to 0 % at week 9 , and remained negative until week 30 . The positivity rate for IgG peaked at 50 % at week 3 , ﬂ uctuated for several weeks , and returned to 0 % 30 wk after onset of disease . In patients with severe clinical symptoms , the positivity rates for IgA and IgG were consistently higher than in mild cases at each time point . The positivity rate for IgA peaked at week 3 ( 100 % ) , then slowly decreased to baseline at week 10 , whereas IgG peaked FIGURE 1 . Specimen collection and testing . A total of 333 saliva samples were collected from 187 participants who had positive results for SARS - CoV - 2 by rRT - PCR or Ag test . In cohort I , 113 participants provided a single sample and 32 participants provided samples on a weekly basis for 4 (cid:1) 5 wk after diag - nosis . In cohort II , 42 participants provided saliva samples at different times after the onset of disease .

In cohort II , salivary IgA levels in patients with severe clinical symptoms peaked at week 3 ( median , 346 ng SARS - CoV - 2 (cid:1) speci ﬁ c IgA / 100 m g of total IgA ; IQR , 128 . 2 (cid:1) 855 . 9 ) and remained positive for the entire study ( 10 wk ) , whereas salivary IgG titers peaked at week 4 ( median , 810 . 5 ng SARS - CoV - 2 (cid:1) speci ﬁ c IgG / 100 m g of total IgG ; IQR , 598 . 2 (cid:1) 1778 ) and remained positive until week 10 . In patients with mild disease , salivary IgA titers peaked later , at week 5 ( median , 143 . 6 ng SARS - CoV - 2 (cid:1) speci ﬁ c IgA / 100 m g of total IgA ; IQR , 9 . 94 (cid:1) 277 . 3 ) and became undetectable at week 7 , whereas salivary IgG Abs peaked earlier at week 3 ( median , 507 . 9 ng SARS - CoV - 2 (cid:1) speci ﬁ c IgG / 100 m g of total IgG ; IQR , 58 (cid:1) 957 ) , although with ﬂ uctuating values , salivary IgG titers remained detect - able until week 36 after onset of disease . In asymptomatic partici - pants ( n 5 8 ) , salivary IgA titers were detected 1 wk earlier than IgG . Overall , during the ﬁ rst 6 wk after onset of symptoms , salivary IgA and IgG titers were higher in patients with severe symptoms than in patients with mild symptoms ( Fig . 3D ) . Discussion We report the development and validation of in - house EIAs to quan - titatively assess the presence of SARS - CoV - 2 (cid:1) speci ﬁ c IgA and IgG in saliva and show its value to describe the salivary immune response after natural SARS - CoV - 2 infection . Both the IgA and IgG assays were highly accurate , sensitive , and speci ﬁ c . The sensi - tivity of both assays was high ( IgA , 95 . 5 % ; IgG , 89 . 7 % ) without compromising speci ﬁ city ( IgA , 99 % ; IgG , 97 % ) . Other published studies have shown high sensitivity for IgG ( 88 (cid:1) 98 . 4 % ) but low sensitivity ( 17 (cid:1) 59 % ) for IgA , with a high speci ﬁ city for both iso - types ( 96 (cid:1) 100 % ) ( 8 (cid:1) 11 ) . The difference in sensitivity between our and other IgA assays could be explained by the assay platform , type of sample , or collection time after infection . The LODs of 1 . 98 ng / ml for SARS - CoV - 2 IgA and 0 . 3 ng / ml for SARS - CoV - 2 (cid:1) speci ﬁ c IgG suggest that both assays are suitable for the detection of salivary Abs in samples collected early after infection up to several weeks after recovery . Overall , we detected SARS - CoV - 2 (cid:1) speci ﬁ c IgA and IgG respon - ses as early as 1 wk after onset of disease or diagnosis when disease data were not available . The IgA positivity rate decreased to zero after 10 wk , whereas the IgG positivity rate remained high for at least up to 30 wk . Similarly , data from previous cross - sectional stud - ies showed detectable SARS - CoV - 2 (cid:1) speci ﬁ c IgA and IgG levels in saliva 2 (cid:1) 4 wk after the onset of symptoms , with only IgG response Abs persisting beyond 60 d ( 8 , 9 ) . A different study reporting results from single saliva samples collected < 3 to 9 mo after onset of dis - ease showed a consistently high IgG positivity but a signi ﬁ cant decrease of IgA ( 10 ) . In a longitudinal study including 95 partici - pants , the mean time from disease onset to IgG detection in saliva was 9 (cid:1) 11 d , and IgG Abs remained detectable until day 90 ( 20 ) . In cohort II , when no saliva sample was collected during the ﬁ rst week after onset of disease , we assumed that participants would have had negative results for both of SARS - CoV - 2 (cid:1) speci ﬁ c IgA and IgG . Salivary IgA levels peaked 3 wk after onset of disease and remained elevated until at least week 10 in participants with severe disease symptoms . Conversely , in patients with mild disease , sali - vary IgA levels were transient , peaked late at week 5 , and returned Table II .

Development and validation of EIAs for the detection of salivary IgA and IgG against SARS - CoV - 2 . Saliva samples were collected from SARS - CoV - 2 confirmed cases ( IgA , n 5 44 ; IgG , n 5 68 ) . Prepandemic samples were collected between 2009 and 2010 ( n 5 373 ) . Saliva samples were diluted 1 : 10 and added to a 96 - well plate precoated with SARS - CoV - 2 spike ( S ) Ag . ( A ) Sample adjusted OD values for SARS - CoV - 2 IgA and IgG . ( B ) ROC curves for each assay were constructed with data from SARS - CoV - 2 confirmed cases and prepandemic samples . The optimal cutoff value to differenti - ate cases from controls was set as the maximum Youden index ( sensitivity 1 specificity − 1 ) . ( C ) Sensitivity ( 95 % CI ) and specificity ( 95 % CI ) for three dif - ferent cutoff values [ mean ( ¯ x ) of the prepandemic samples plus SD ] were considered for each Ab isotype . ( D ) To assess the LOD for each isotype , nonlinear regression was performed using five saliva samples serially diluted in two independent experiments . Adjusted OD values were extrapolated from the IgA or IgG standard curve for each sample and dilution .

Participants with severe disease showed a later ( week 4 ) peak for IgG than those with mild disease , and both remained positive until the end of the study . These initial increases in salivary IgA and IgG were similar in asymptomatic individuals , although the number of samples available after 1 wk was limited . Our data agree with the study by Pisanic et al . , who found that FIGURE 3 . Kinetics and magnitude of SARS - CoV - 2 (cid:1) specific salivary Ab response postinfection .

Another group found similar IgG and IgA kinetics in sera from mild and severe cases ( 21 ) . Several studies reported higher correlation for IgG than for IgA when testing paired serum and saliva samples ( 8 , 9 ) , leading them to question the advantage of testing IgA in saliva . Early SARS - CoV - 2 humoral immune responses are dominated by IgA Abs , which remained detectable in saliva for a longer time than in serum ( days 49 (cid:1) 73 after symptoms ) . IgA Abs also contribute to virus neutralization to a greater extent than IgG , although they circulate for a shorter time than IgG ( 22 ) . Given the less invasive collection method and the transient presence of IgA in contrast to long - lasting IgG , testing for IgA in saliva might allow a better understanding of the timing of infection . Our study has several limitations . First , our assays were designed and validated to detect Abs against the Wuhan - Hu - 1 strain , which may become a limitation , considering the continues evolution of SARS - CoV - 2 . Although the assays can be adapted and validated for new strains , the applicability of the assays described here to cur - rently circulating strains is unknown . Second , data on the onset and severity of disease were not always available . Second , collection of saliva samples did not always start on day 0 after onset of disease , not all participants provided samples at the same time points , and a limited number of longitudinal samples from asymptomatic individ - uals were available . Third , because of low sample volume , IgG test - ing could not be performed on all saliva samples . Fourth , saliva samples were not screened for the presence of Abs against SARS - CoV - 1 or MERS - CoV . Others have shown some cross - reactivity with SARS - CoV - 1 and MERS - CoV , which would limit the applica - bility of these assays in a population with high SARS - CoV - 1 and / or MERS - CoV incidence . Cross - reactivity with endemic coronaviruses has also been reported particularly in younger populations ( 23 , 24 ) . We tested a limited number of serum samples ( ages 1 (cid:1) 67 ) with low , medium , and high reactivity to each endemic coronavirus spike protein . Although we showed no cross - reactivity in our assay in samples collected from children , and considering the fact that Ab levels are lower in saliva than in serum ( 25 ) , more pediatric samples need to be tested to con ﬁ rm if these assays can be applied con ﬁ - dently in samples from this age group . Finally , paired serum sam - ples from individuals who provided saliva samples were not available ; therefore , a correlation between saliva and serum SARS - CoV - 2 Abs could not be evaluated . In summary , we developed and validated EIAs that are sensitive and speci ﬁ c to detect SARS - CoV - 2 (cid:1) speci ﬁ c IgA and IgG Abs in saliva . Signi ﬁ cant ﬂ uctuations of salivary IgA and IgG Ab levels were observed after infection . Detection of salivary Abs may serve as an easy - to - employ screening method for population and transmis - sion studies as well as for evaluation of vaccine response , especially when collection of blood is challenging or not feasible .
