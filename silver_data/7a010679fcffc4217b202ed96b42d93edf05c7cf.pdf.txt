This paper ana - lyzes the Facebook communication of political leaders and health departments from 17 countries during the COVID - 19 pandemic . We evaluate the citizen’s response under the frameworks of media rich - ness and user engagement . We note that governments and leaders communicate primarily through richer media ( photos and videos ) , despite a negative correlation between media richness and user engagement . Plain - text messages posted by country leaders attract the most engagement , while their COVID - 19 communication tends to generate lower engagement . On the other hand , health depart - ments’ pages experienced a sharp increase in engagement around COVID - 19 communication as citizens sought information during the pandemic . Finally , topical analysis shows that Discussions and Co - Use of COVID - 19 with other topics can boost citizens’ engage - ment . Our comparative analysis shows practical implications for social media users and social media designers . Our findings can help governments and organizations design effective social media communication during crises .

Under - standing the phenomena behind such interaction and the resulting user engagement with content is an important research area for social and computer science researchers , i . e . , devising more effi - cient methods to disperse comprehensible and relevant informa - tion [ 6 , 16 , 25 ] . The scale of the COVID - 19 pandemic has never been seen before in the social media age . The resulting social isolation led citizens to turn to social media for accessing information and pre - serving social contact [ 11 ] . This situation revealed new challenges and limitations in government and citizens’ social media communi - cation . Lessons learned from such experience will help understand the implications of social media during large - scale crises . This paper sheds light on governments’ Facebook communi - cation content characteristics that lead to higher citizen engage - ment during the COVID - 19 pandemic . Strategies like the use of hashtags and attitudinal language can increase the engagement of citizen [ 20 , 67 ] . This work , in particular , focuses on a detailed message niche and social media modalities in terms of content type ( videos , photos , and text ) as a confounding factor in engagement . Our observations can help governments understand the impact of using a particular communication modality and a choice of topic to increase engagement . We measure the engagement based on the typical engagement markers on Facebook , i . e . , likes , shares and comments . We correlate such engagement with the content type and topic through a multicountry ( 17 countries and regions ) and multilingual ( 10 languages ) study of the use of Facebook by heads of state and official health departments across the globe ( e . g . , America , Asia , Europe , and Oceania ) . For these regions , we collect year - long data from the head of government and the local health department’s Facebook pages , from the early signs of the pandemic 105 dg . o 2022 , June 15 – 17 , 2022 , Virtual Event , Republic of Korea Haq et al . in January 2020 to December 2020 and consisting of over 50 , 000 posts . We consider the clarity of a message that can be embedded in three media types ( photo , video , and text ) as a confounding factor for the engagement . To better formalize this quality into the media types , we leverage the Media Richness Framework [ 22 ] that de - scribes the degree of informativeness by media types . Social media provides opportunities to engage with the audiences directly ; users can respond through a multiplicity of engagement cues . Content - type ( e . g . , photo or video ) and the content itself ( e . g . , technical or general information ) on social media play a significant role in communicating timely and relevant information during a crisis [ 6 ] . In contrast , Uncertainty ( lack of information ) and Equivocality ( am - biguity ) are significant factors impacting governmental commu - nication [ 23 ] . We provide a fine - grained analysis of the citizens’ response to the government campaign and evaluate which types of posts are the most efficient at conveying information . In particular , this paper aims to answer the following research questions : • RQ 1 : What type of content ( ranked on media rich - ness framework – Text , Photo , Video ) in governmental communications generates the most response from the public ? • RQ 2 : What COVID - 19 - related topics yield higher user engagement , and which engagement marker is more prominent ? • RQ 3 : Is there any difference between health - related and leaders pages on COVID - 19 communication and engagement ? And how does it vary across the coun - tries ? This study with year - long data provides insights into how gov - ernments can leverage Facebook as an efficient crisis management channel . We primarily categorize the posts based on their content type and topic and further analyze the engagement received by the leaders and government pages . Such analysis can help the leaders and governments understand their citizens’ content preferences and design efficient communication plans on a large scale . We show that although many governments primarily communicate through videos , this media type may not be the most appropriate to keep citizens engaged , even compared to purely text - based messages . Citizens are more likely to respond to topics related to live discus - sions , policies , and situation awareness posts with a higher number of comments . In contrast , the posts about technological tools such as tracking apps only result in very mild engagement . 2 RELATED WORK The use of Information and Communication Technologies ( ICT ) such as social media to control and prevent a crisis developed into an interdisciplinary field as Crisis Informatics [ 20 , 47 , 58 , 65 ] . Informating ( i . e . , narrowing the gap between information producers and consumers ) the relevant stakeholders through social media in various crisis scenarios impacts the crisis control [ 58 ] . Also , through informating , social media can decentralise crisis response management compared to centralised and concentrated source [ 52 ] . Cyberspaces enables Citizen’s collaboration with the governments in several ways [ 10 , 27 , 41 ] . For instance government and citizens’ co - produce the content to increase the outreach of the message [ 45 ] . In this paper , we aim to understand the most efficient content and message for informing and rallying the citizens for crisis control . In the following paragraphs , we briefly discuss the relevant literature related to governmental communication and social media usage related to COVID - 19 . 2 . 1 COVID - 19 and Social Media COVID - 19 emerged as one of the prominent research motivations to study social media communication for public health [ 15 , 24 , 56 , 66 ] . OSNs are the biggest data source to analyse the societal behav - ior during this pandemic . A large number of studies focused on sentiment analysis [ 7 ] and topical discourse on in the soci - eties [ 21 , 24 , 46 ] . An earlier research emphasizes the similarity of COVID - 19 content sharing patterns across different OSNs and other online platforms [ 17 ] . However , a more recent study shows that social media discourse on COVID - 19 varies among social media platforms and physical locations [ 24 ] . Our work further highlights that even on the same platform , the nature of the pages ( leader vs health department ) also show significant difference in the page growth . 2 . 2 Governmental COVID - 19 Communication The use of social media to support governance is common [ 5 , 25 , 28 , 35 , 35 ] . OSNs are used to disseminate information to the cit - izens [ 29 ] and listen back to their opinions [ 25 , 57 ] . A diverse choice of OSNs and respective multi - modalities offer a room for re - searchers to evaluate the effective communication [ 14 , 37 , 45 , 66 ] . In terms of crisis related communication , one of the main objective of the governments is to update the citizens about the control and pre - vention measures [ 50 ] , in line with the ‘informating’ objectives [ 58 ] . Accordingly , the role of country leaders is also critical in crisis com - munication [ 31 ] . Verified accounts such as governments or official accounts can be a source of accurate information [ 3 , 40 , 48 ] . Several studies evaluate the role of governmental social media communication in context of COVID - 19 [ 36 , 49 , 54 , 61 , 68 ] . Govern - mental organizations used OSNs to disseminate information related to COVID - 19 [ 61 ] . and increased the tendency of their followers to evaluate the quality of COVID - 19 related information and avoid misinformation [ 32 , 60 ] . In contrast , our work compares govern - mental communication , not only among several countries , but also within the same countries , among different representatives . We fo - cus on the government leaders and the health departments’ pages . As political figures , the government leaders can exhibit a partisan bias , and health department pages may become more relevant by dispensing health advice and updates , as suggested by increase in their followers . 2 . 3 COVID - 19 and Citizen Engagement Several studies analyse confounding factors for higher engagement in COVID - 19 communication [ 14 , 66 ] . The amount of information in the message and its format ( e . g . , a photo or a video ) have a sig - nificant effect on engagement . To better formalize the impact of the format of the message on engagement , Chen et al . [ 14 ] use the Media Richness Framework [ 22 ] to categorize different media types according to their media richness . Depending on the social media capabilities to share the information in the form of videos , photos , 106 Governmental Communication on Facebook during the COVID - 19 Pandemic dg . o 2022 , June 15 – 17 , 2022 , Virtual Event , Republic of Korea text or external links , the level of information can be categorized ac - cording to media richness [ 14 ] . Yang et al . used similar comparisons for Wuhan’s local government social media accounts [ 66 ] . Both studies found that , despite carrying higher media richness , videos get less engagement from the audience . However , both of these works only consider one type of accounts ( usually the local gov - ernment accounts ) in their analysis . Finally , [ 20 ] uses the retweets measures to highlight the impact of using collective communica - tion strategies to engage the citizens . Our study builds upon such theories of media richness and user engagement . We attempt to study the richness of content posted by country leaders and health departments against user engagement . This study aims to figure out whether the inverse relationship between media richness ( e . g . , text , images , and videos ) and engagement ( e . g . , likes , shares , and comments ) is universal , or the local culture and the types of pages contribute to more nuanced findings . 3 METHODOLOGY This study follows a standard content analysis technique ; starting with data sampling , coding , and analysis [ 8 ] . We adopt a compara - tive approach between COVID - 19 and non - COVID - 19 related posts . We then use statistical analysis on interaction parameters ( i . e . , like , share , and comment ) to quantify social media engagement . We first define the basic terminologies , annotations , and respective descriptive statistics that we are going to use in the rest of the work . 3 . 1 Dataset We aim to present a selection of countries representative of the COVID - 19 situation at the time of data collection in the late 2020 . Thus , we select the countries with the highest COVID - 19 cases across the major geographical regions . We limit our selection crite - ria to regions where the government leader and the health depart - ment use Facebook . And finally , we only consider the regions whose language corresponds to the researchers’ linguistic capabilities . Our dataset includes the USA , Canada , Brasil , Columbia , Peru , Hong Kong , South Korea , Taiwan , Turkey , India , Pakistan , Australia , New Zealand , Spain , France , Italy , and the UK . Accordingly , we collect data from the verified Facebook page of the state leader ( elected leader serving as either Prime Minister / President or executive of the country based on her democratic system ) . We also collect data from the verified and official page of the health department / ministry in a country . We manually search for governmental websites and political party / individual websites to find the Facebook accounts . In case of the absence of links to social media , we search on the internet to find the relevant Facebook page and manually verify each page . We use the CrowdTangle API 1 to collect the data from our seed accounts . We collect every post shared by these accounts from the 1st of January 2020 to the 1st of December 2020 . We re - trieve all fields provided by API ; for instance text and number of interactions ( comments , shares , likes , and emotion reactions ) for a post . We accumulate 37 accounts belonging to 17 political leaders and 20 health departments , resulting in 51 , 361 posts in which heads of state share 21 , 763 posts . 1 https : / / www . crowdtangle . com 3 . 1 . 1 Ratio of posts related to COVID - 19 . We use a comprehensive list of keywords based on our dataset’s different languages to filter COVID - 19 related posts . Five researchers curated the keywords who are either native speakers or have multilingual proficiency in each country’s primary languages . We start our sampling with the words representing COVID - 19 at various pandemic stages . These words consisted of the words likes ‘COVID’ , ‘virus’ , ‘coronavirus’ , ‘ncov’ , ‘novel’ , ‘pandemic’ , ‘COVID - 19’ , ‘wuhan’ , ‘2019 - nCoV’ , ‘isola - tion’ , and ‘SARS - CoV - 2’ . We then use the combination of the words that represent the precautions and control measures and some more generic words related to pandemic . ‘mask’ , ‘pandemic’ , ‘stay home’ , ’stayhome’ , ‘save live’ , ‘lockdown’ , ‘wuhan’ , ‘2019 - nCoV’ , ‘isolation’ , ‘quarantine’ , ‘social distance’ , and ‘wash hands’ . After finalizing the keyword list in all languages , we perform iterative filtering of the content to remove any false positives for COVID - 19 related mes - sages . In total , our dataset has around 24 , 000 COVID - 19 related posts . Table ? ? ( Appendix ) shows the frequency of overall posts . Table 5 ( Appendix ) shows the numbers in each category and a ratio of COVID - 19 related posts to the total posts in our observation pe - riod . The results show that the ratio of combined COVID - 19 related posts varies from 20 % to 80 % . Many factors may affect this difference : the severity of the pan - demic in the country and the intensity of the response ; with the government introducing more measures to slow down the spread . Similarly , organizational differences between countries and regions can significantly impact the type of communication . For instance , France’s highest governmental authority is not only in charge of healthcare but also of other social services . Different regions have a dedicated organization for disease prevention , with a more specific focus on COVID - 19 . 3 . 2 Citizen Engagement In this paper , we focus on quantitative measures of engagement ; using the number of comments , shares , and likes , as often used in communication research [ 8 , 9 ] . We use the engagement measure , normalised based on the number of followers for a page , as pro - posed by [ 9 ] . The engagement measure is calculated as the sum of the popularity ( number of likes ) , the commitment ( number of comments ) and the virality ( number of shares ) . We report the average number of engagement markers depend - ing on the media type ( photo , video , or status ) in Table 6 ( Appendix ) . We observe that non - COVID - 19 posts often elicit more responses from Facebook users than COVID - 19 posts for all media types . How - ever , the engagement is often more uniform for COVID - 19 posts , with a lower standard deviation . This difference may be explained by the vastly diversified topics among the non - COVID - 19 posts . 3 . 3 Media Richness A communication medium’s ability to deliver a message with clarity is referred to as the medium’s richness [ 22 ] . This ability is evaluated through several factors , including the multiplicity of cues , gram - mar commonalities , and personal focus . Face - to - face interaction is considered a highly rich interaction as it features most of the avail - able cues to help share a message between people . Contrariwise , a text - based message embeds fewer cues and is considered a less rich medium . Facebook allows users to share videos , photos , and 107 dg . o 2022 , June 15 – 17 , 2022 , Virtual Event , Republic of Korea Haq et al . text - based messages . Such content can either be native to Facebook ( content uploaded directly to Facebook ) or links to third - party web - sites . Crowdtangle API classifies the content ( videos , photos , and text - based messages ) depending on whether it is uploaded directly to Facebook or shared from some other websites . The media type classification are as follow : video , native video , YouTube , live video complete , photo , link , and status ( see Table ? ? ) . Videos are classified as Videos if they were uploaded directly to the platform , while live videos complete are the videos that are premiered live using the Facebook Live feature . YouTube and video link is a further classifica - tion of a video link depending on whether it is a YouTube video or a link to a video on any other platform . All the above video types are regarded as higher media - rich content . Photos are considered at a medium scale of media richness . Link and status ( text ) are low media - richness content . The dataset’s most frequently shared content types are photos , videos , and text statuses in decreasing order . Although prominent in the non - COVID - 19 related category , status messages are not as common in COVID - 19 related messages compared to photos . Facebook allows the video to be streamed live or to be uploaded from the operating device , along with an option to schedule it later . The count of the posts in each data type is shown in Table ? ? ( Appendix ) . 3 . 4 Message Content Topic To categorise the message content , we take inspiration from a codebook with four main categories : latest news , appreciation for front - line staff , guidance for stakeholders , and information about gov - ernment crisis handling [ 14 ] . Our preliminary data analysis showed that not all content in our dataset can be organized in the original four categories . For instance , many messages provide updates on government policies or invite citizens to live discussions and press conferences . There is also significant communication around the promotion of technology tools . To develop a modified codebook , we randomly select 15 % of the COVID - 19 related data sample [ 8 ] from each countries’ data to label according to our topical categories , with the Integrated Deductive and Inductive approach [ 39 ] . Two postgraduate students were then given the data , and their agree - ment on the categorization was measured . A substantial agreement with Kappa - cohen k = 0 . 74 was achieved [ 43 ] . Finally , eight cate - gories are finalised as follows : • Situational Awareness ( S ) : Information on the current situation of COVID - 19 , such as report on the number of cases , daily increases , or mortality rates . • Prevention Tips ( T ) : Messages share practices to prevent the COVID - 19 spread . These tips can include reminders to wash hands or wear a mask or explanation on how to wear a mask . • Policy Updates ( P ) : Announcements of government poli - cies related to COVID - 19 . Messages contain updates about the number of medical personnel and equipment , guide - lines for individuals , businesses , public spaces sanitation , and travel restrictions . Occasionally , messages contain global government policies such as general economic reforms with reference to COVID - 19 . • Co - Use ( C ) : COVID - 19 is co - used with other topics . Mes - sages belonging to this category are either global messages encompassing many independent topics , including COVID - 19 ( e . g . , weekly government updates ) , or messages linking COVID - 19 to other topics ( e . g . , COVID - 19 and presidential elections in the USA ) . • Discussions and Press Conferences ( D ) : Live audio or video streams for Q & A and press conferences . Many gov - ernments provide periodic live streams for informing their citizens in real - time . • Technology Tools ( TT ) : Information about the websites and mobile apps by the government . Many governments set up at least two kinds of tools : websites and portals for tracking the pandemic and mobile apps for patients’ contact tracing . • General Information ( I ) : General information about the pandemic and the coronavirus . Often , parts of the message bring further details on the coronavirus without belonging to the above categories . Symptoms , medications , and infor - mation on transmission belong in this category . Figure 1a shows the frequency of the manually labelled con - tent topics . Messages primarily fall into the General Information ( I ) category , as most messages in our dataset present additional infor - mation that does not fit into other categories . Health Tips ( T ) also account for a large portion of the messages , followed by Discussions ( D ) and Situation Awareness ( S ) messages . Fewer posts fit into the Co - Use ( C ) , Policy ( P ) , and Technology Tools ( TT ) . Overall , govern - ment leaders and health authorities focus on live communication and prevention through health tips and situation reports . 4 ANALYSIS AND RESULTS FOR RQS In the following sections , we analyse each research question indi - vidually . 4 . 1 RQ 1 : Media Richness and Engagement We look at the difference in engagement based on media richness . Our media richness categories are in line with [ 8 ] , with the de - tailed granularity of the video types . One - way ANOVA evaluates the media type’s significance on three engagement markers ( Like , Comments , Shares ) . The media type has a statistically significant effect on all markers ( p < 0 . 001 ) , followed by the Bonferroni adjust - ment . We extend this analysis by performing negative binomial regression on the data . As the standard deviation of our interaction parameters is higher than the mean ( Table 6 , Appendix ) , the data is not normally distributed . We thus perform negative binomial regression and use the Incident Rate Ratio ( IRR ) [ 12 , 51 ] that al - lows comparing the change in the engagement parameters’ values ( likes , shares , and comments ) for the content types ( photo , videos , text ) . Additionally , the IRR represents the relative difference in the incidence rate of a given engagement parameter compared to the reference variable . For instance , in Table 1 , the IRR of ‘likes’ for COVID - 19 - related photos is 2 . 66 , with the media type ‘link’ used as a reference . Such IRR means that the incidence rate of ‘likes’ for a COVID - 19 related post featuring a photo is 2 . 66 times higher than for a COVID - 19 related post featuring a ‘link’ . 108 Governmental Communication on Facebook during the COVID - 19 Pandemic dg . o 2022 , June 15 – 17 , 2022 , Virtual Event , Republic of Korea Table 1 : Effect of media type on Likes , Shares , and Comments .

Table 1 shows the effect of media type on the number of com - ments , likes , and shares as compared to the ‘link’ media type for our entire dataset . Both COVID - 19 and non - COVID - 19 data show a consistent effect of the media type on the engagement parameters . The incidence rate of ‘comments’ ( 𝐼𝑅𝑅 > 11 ) , ‘likes’ ( 𝐼𝑅𝑅 ≥ 12 ) , and ‘shares’ ( 𝐼𝑅𝑅 > 6 ) for ‘status’ ( text - based posts ) in COVID - 19 cate - gory is much higher than for ‘link’ posts . Media - rich content such as ‘native video’ and ’photo’ shows a much lower incidence rate for all engagement parameters than the ‘status’ type . We notice that COVID - 19 posts show a much higher engagement disparity across content types than non - COVID - 19 posts for all three engagement parameters . Moreover , previous studies show a negative correla - tion between media richness and user engagement [ 14 ] . However , our results only partly confirm these studies . According to Table 1 , plain - text statuses generate much more engagement than more media - rich content such as videos . However , we show an essential distinction between live videos and other video uploads on Facebook . Live videos get significantly more comments than regular video uploads [ 59 ] that are not neces - sarily streamed in real - time . This observation potentially suggests an analogy of live video streaming to a face - to - face meeting [ 38 ] . 4 . 2 RQ2 : Content Topic and Engagement We address the question of topic - related engagement at 2 - level granularity . We compare the engagement related to COVID - 19 posts with non - COVID - 19 posts , before delving into the details of the COVID - 19 posts . 4 . 2 . 1 COVID - 19 and Engagement . We evaluate the engagement difference for COVID - 19 post to the non - COVID - 19 post on our three engagement markers . All our engagement markers have a lower incidence rate for COVID - 19 - related posts than its counter - part . COVID - 19 related posts get 0 . 61 times the likes , 0 . 59 times the shares and 0 . 35 times the comments as compared to those of non - COVID - 19 related posts , which can be explained by the number of periodic posts for situation updates , leading to a lower engagement of citizens . We notice that comments have a significantly lower incidence rate for COVID - 19 posts , showing a lower level of direct citizen interaction . 109 dg . o 2022 , June 15 – 17 , 2022 , Virtual Event , Republic of Korea Haq et al .

Now , we look at engage - ment based on our COVID - 19 content - topic as described in Sec - tion 3 . We only use the COVID - 19 related posts for this analysis as our categories are solely based on crisis - related topics . We use the labelled data to train a deep learning model and build a clas - sifier to categorise the rest of the COVID - 19 related data . We use the SOTA pre - trained HuggingFace transformers library to build a multi - lingual classifier [ 26 ] , and hence classify our data . Next , as a similar approach in RQ1 , negative binomial regression evaluates message content’s effect on the engagement parameters . Table 2 shows the IRR for each content type using Technology and Tips ( TT ) as a reference . Remarkably , situational awareness messages have a lower in - cidence rate for the number of likes and shares , while situational awareness and tips have a lower IRR for the number of comments . We notice a significant effect of the content topic on the engagement parameters . Citizens are more likely to comment , thus showing their opinions on posts that explicitly request citizen feedback ( dis - cussions ) , government policies , and broader topics encompassing COVID - 19 . Noticeably , citizens react more passively to health tips and daily updates . Most messages involving situation awareness are periodic ( daily or weekly ) ; they elicit fewer likes and shares than the other categories . Finally , technological tools result in a low number of comments , likes , and shares , consistently with the relative lack of success in tracking applications . 4 . 3 RQ3 : Page Specific Analysis Finally , we compare : 1 ) posts from country leaders and government health departments for media richness and 2 ) content - topic relative engagement between both types of accounts . Users who like or follow a page can do it for different reasons . For instance , a par - ticular leader’s Facebook page’s following could be motivated by a partisan or political interest . However , the health - related page followers may have other motives than purely political . We expect citizens to respond differently to similar content posted on each page . We finally compare these pages for each country to derive country - specific communication patterns . 4 . 3 . 1 Media Richness and Engagement . We display the IRR of the engagement parameters depending on the content type in Tables 3 and 4 for leaders and health departments , respectively . Leader pages ( Table 3 ) show consistent results with what we observed for the entire dataset . Likes , shares , and comments have a significantly higher incidence rate for statuses than links . Richer media displays lower engagement . The IRR shows that if other parameters are kept constant , text - based messages will average almost four times more comments , likes and shares than photo messages in COVID - 19 related messages . Similar to the entire dataset , our engagement parameters’ incidence rate is more homogeneous among content types for non - COVID - 19 posts . In terms of the health department pages ( Table 4 ) , this trend does not hold . The status messages show a lower engagement than media - rich content such as photos and videos . Likes , comments , and shares have a much higher incidence rate for video and photo content as compared to link content . Na - tive videos get a higher number of likes and shares in COVID - 19 categories . However , live videos get more comments than the native videos in both COVID - 19 and non - COVID - 19 categories . We notice that live videos generate three times more comments than photos and two times more than native videos , but fewer likes and shares . We then compare the incidence rate of likes , shares , and comments for the health departments’ pages while using the leader’s page as a reference . Our results are statistically significant and show that health - related pages are likely to get about 0 . 45 times the likes , 0 . 46 times the shares , and 0 . 13 times the comments on their COVID - 19 posts compared to the leaders’ pages . Com - ments have an incidence rate almost ten times lower for health departments’ COVID - 19 posts than leaders’ COVID - 19 posts . Re - garding non - COVID - 19 posts , health departments’ pages display a significantly lower engagement than the leaders’ pages , with about 0 . 05 times the likes , 0 . 11 times the shares , and 0 . 03 times the com - ments . Such an observation suggests that users primarily follow health departments’ pages for COVID - 19 related posts , while they are significantly more interested in other topics discussed by the country leaders . The key reasons for the above differences in en - gagement between leaders’ posts and health departments’ posts can be explained as follows : ( 1 ) Live videos get higher comments for health department pages . We believe that this is embedded in the live video broadcast modality on Facebook . In general , live videos on Facebook are a broadcast medium where the broadcaster streams in real - time . However , the users on the viewing end are not part of the video broadcast , and the comments are the only real - time functionality available to the users to interact . This is also visible in the Facebook design ; comments during the live video stream are tagged with the timestamp in the 110 Governmental Communication on Facebook during the COVID - 19 Pandemic dg . o 2022 , June 15 – 17 , 2022 , Virtual Event , Republic of Korea Table 3 : IRR for likes , shares , and comments with respect to the content type for country leaders’ posts , using " link " content type as a reference : statistically significant with ∗ = 𝑝 < 0 . 001 ; IRR values and standard errors with comma separation . The engagement parameters have a higher incidence rate for text - based messages ( status ) than richer media such as videos and photos .

Users use the comments to provide feedback or ask questions in real - time . ( 2 ) Richer media gets higher engagement for health department posts , while text - based messages show a higher engagement for country leaders . Health departments worldwide tend to communicate primarily through photos and videos , while country leaders primarily use text - based posts . Such a dis - proportion may explain our results , as leaders and health departments may focus on content with a higher engage - ment . At the same time , citizens may also be more engaged with the type of content they expect to find on a given page . ( 3 ) COVID - 19 posts get more engagement than non - COVID - 19 posts for health department pages compared to leaders pages . Overall , people tend to follow health department pages for health - related reasons , while they follow country leaders for a more general agenda . With COVID - 19 being a significant health - related event , citizens are expected to interact more on the topic on health - related pages . 4 . 3 . 2 COVID - 19 and Engagement . We then compare the engage - ment for COVID - 19 related posts to non - COVID - 19 posts for coun - try leaders and health departments . We use IRR for ‘likes’ , ‘shares’ , and ‘comments’ based on the page type ( leader and health depart - ment ) . The data is normalized based on the number of followers each page has . We use non - COVID - 19 posts as a baseline for com - parison . For COVID - 19 posts by country leaders , we notice a sharp decrease in all three engagement markers’ incidence rates compared to non - COVID - 19 posts . Leader pages get 0 . 63 , 0 . 65 and 0 . 66 times the likes , shares , and comments they would get on non - COVID - 19 posts . On the other hand , the incidence rate of likes , shares and comments is significantly higher for COVID - 19 posts posted by health departments than non - COVID - 19 posts . Such an increase is especially noticeable for likes , which have an incidence rate more than six times ( 6 . 29 ) higher for COVID - 19 posts . IRR for shares and comments is 2 . 67 and 2 . 66 times compared to non - COVID - 19 posts for health - related pages . This result confirms our findings from the 111 dg . o 2022 , June 15 – 17 , 2022 , Virtual Event , Republic of Korea Haq et al . previous subsection , where we noted a wider discrepancy in en - gagement between country leaders’ pages and health departments’ pages for non - COVID - 19 posts than for COVID - 19 . All of these results are statistically significant , 𝑝 < 0 . 05 . Next , we compare the engagement across the leader and health - related pages for COVID - 19 related engagement . We use the leader page as the baselines and measure the likelihood of getting likes , shares , and comments on the interaction parameter to compare the reach of sharing COVID - 19 content on a leader’s page to posting a COVID - 19 message on a health - related page . Our results are statis - tically significant with p < 0 . 05 and show that health - related pages are likely to get about 0 . 45 times the likes , 0 . 46 times the shares , and 0 . 13 times the comments on their COVID - 19 posts compared to leader pages COVID - 19 posts . There is less difference in IRR for the comments on COVID - 19 related posts . In terms of non - COVID - 19 posts , the difference in IRR is even more significant . Health - related pages are likely to get about 0 . 05 times the likes , 0 . 11 times the shares , and 0 . 03 times the comments on the posts compared to leader pages on non - COVID - 19 related posts . It sug - gests that COVID - 19 related posts have received more interest on the health pages than other posts 4 . 3 . 3 Region - Specific Analysis . Leaders and health departments across our dataset show distinct behaviour in social media sharing and focus . COVID - 19 represents more than 70 % of Hong Kong and Taiwan posts , between 60 and 70 % in France and India , 50 - 60 % for New Zealand , Spain , Canada , Columbia , South Korea , and Australia and 40 - 50 % for Brazil , UK , Italy and Peru . Pakistan , the USA , and Turkey are the last three . However , the absolute number of posts in the US is higher than in other regions . Further analysis within each country shows that health - related pages are more active than leaders’ pages on COVID - 19 . Thus , we compare social media usage and engagement within each region independently . We compare the leader’s page and the health department’s page to see the efficacy of niche - oriented pages and the content type within each country . ‘Photo’ and ‘video’ both combined make more than 50 percent of the content on health related pages across all countries , with ‘photo’ being the most used and ‘video’ as the 2 𝑛𝑑 most used content type . For leaders’ pages , content type preference is not consistent across the countries . The top three content choices are ‘video’ , ‘photo’ , ‘text’ . However , the most used content type varies from country to country . For instance , Hong Kong’s leader has more photos while India’s leader has more text - based messages than other media types . The health - related pages display a higher engagement for ‘photo’ and ‘video’ media types . The lack of text - based status messages limits the confirmation of the overall pattern . In terms of videos , ‘live video’ gets more comments . However , the overall ‘likes’ and ‘shares’ are higher for ‘native video’ and ‘video’ types . It is also interesting that ‘YouTube videos get lower engagement than other videos . As displayed in the previous sections , the health departments’ page is more active for COVID - 19 communication than the leader’s page . We show the number of COVID - 19 related posts and the distribution of content topics per day for Australia in Figure 2 . 2 We use the stacked distribution of topical content from each day 2 The figures for the 16 other countries and regions can be found at https : / / github . com / ehsanulhaq1 / tips _ tech _ tidings / blob / main / supplementary . pdf for 11 months . The right y - axis shows the daily number of cases , with a black dotted line plot . the left y - axis shows the number of COVID - 19 related messages per day on the mentioned page , represented by the stacked bars . The Turquoise line represents the user engagement based on per 1000 thousand followers of the page . The results show that even though both health departments’ and leader’s pages posted about COVID - 19 before the peak in each coun - try , engagement only started to increase with the number of COVID - 19 cases in all countries . The leader’s pages are more focused on Policy updates ; however , the health departments are more focused on COVID - 19 tips and situational awareness . This also aligns with our Pearson’s correlation test on the number of users who likes any particular page with the frequency of COVID - 19 related posts . However , Pakistan and New Zealand have a lower correlation for health - related pages , which can result from a massive increase in the community for those pages . However , the correlation is incon - sistent across countries affected by lesser communications from certain accounts . For instance , Peru’s leader has very few posts on COVID - 19 , resulting in a lower correlation score . However , for most pages , the results show a positive correlation . 4 . 3 . 4 Role of the Health Department . Health - related departments were more proactive than the head of state . In our dataset , we have the number of users who like a given page at the time of a given post . We first look at the change in the number of users that like the page from the first post in the year 2020 until the last post in our dataset for that page . Figure 1b shows the number of changes for both leader and health page in a given country . Additionally , in all of the countries in our data sample , the health - related departments were the first ones to post anything regarding COVID - 19 , as shown in Figure 2 for Australia . 2 There is at least one week difference between the health department and leader’s page COVID - 19 related post . Our analysis also shows that most of the countries posted in January 2020 about COVID - 19 ( it was named COVID - 19 later ) , in reference to Wuhan province in China and mentioned that they are monitoring the situation . This shows the countries used social media for COVID - 19 communication even before the COVID - 19 cases appeared . Overall , we see significant differences in content type and topic in both kinds of pages within each country . The health - related pages use videos and photos more frequently than any other type in terms of media types . In some regions , live videos have been used widely by health - related pages . The proportion of status messages to the other media types is relatively low on health - related pages . Health - related pages got significantly larger responses to their COVID - 19 posts than non - COVID - 19 posts . However , this difference is not as large as in the case leader’s pages . Health - related pages observed a larger change in the number of users who liked the page than country leaders ; in addition , the health departments’ page is more active for COVID - 19 communication than the leader’s page . 5 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUDING NOTES This paper provides a comparative analysis of the use of social me - dia by the governments in terms of content type and topic related to COVID - 19 . We look at the leader’s and the health - related Face - book page communications and evaluate the posts’ engagement on these pages . We analyze the citizen engagement against the content 112 Governmental Communication on Facebook during the COVID - 19 Pandemic dg . o 2022 , June 15 – 17 , 2022 , Virtual Event , Republic of Korea 2020 - 01 2020 - 03 2020 - 05 2020 - 07 2020 - 09 2020 - 11 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 5 3 . 0 3 . 5 4 . 0 M e d i a T y p e D i s t r i b u t i o n / E n g a g e m e n t AUS - Head of government ITSDCTTP 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 ( a ) Australia - Govt . 2020 - 01 2020 - 03 2020 - 05 2020 - 07 2020 - 09 2020 - 11 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 M e d i a T y p e D i s t r i b u t i o n / E n g a g e m e n t AUS - Health department ITSDCTTP 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 ( b ) Australia - Health Dept .

The governmental and official communications on social media have been studied in terms of the government strategies to disperse information regarding COVID - 19 [ 19 , 20 , 53 , 67 ] . Our results sup - plement such findings by highlighting the confounding factors for higher engagement on social media . We list the seven key highlights that are important for effective communication in terms of better engagement : 1 ) Higher media richness does not necessarily attract more engagement . Plain text messages have a higher engagement than all other content types . 2 ) Live videos maintain a high engage - ment and , more particularly , a high incidence rate of comments . 3 ) COVID - 19 - related posts display a lower overall engagement than non - COVID - 19 posts . 4 ) Among COVID - 19 posts , Discussions ( D ) and Co - Use of COVID - 19 with other topics ( C ) get the most engagement . 5 ) Plain text status messages lead to a high engage - ment for country leaders , while Health Departments’ pages have higher engagement on live videos . 6 ) Both Health department pages and country leaders share primarily content that gets little engage - ment ( photos , videos ) . In contrast , live videos ( high engagement for health department pages ) and plain - text status ( high engagement for country leaders ) are underrepresented . 7 ) Health Department pages display a much higher engagement for COVID - 19 posts as compared to non - COVID - 19 posts , as opposed to country leaders where non - COVID - 19 posts have a slightly higher engagement . 5 . 1 Media Affordance “The Medium is the message” is a term coined in 1964 , long be - fore the emergence of Web 2 . 0 and social networks [ 44 ] . Media carry the power to transform human actions . Web 2 . 0 not only gave rise to multiple media , for instance , social networking sites , online discussion forums , and messaging applications , but those media are also continuously evolving with ever - increasing affordances . In this work , we extend the efforts made to understand citizens’ engagement in the government’s ( COVID - 19 ) communications on Facebook . We take the content type as our primary variable to mea - sure such response . Our results confirm previous studies’ results about the negative correlation between higher media richness and citizen engagement . We suggest that live videos are effective tools for communication and discussion with citizens from a communi - cation perspective . Our analysis of the data shows that different governments have used the live features to answer citizens’ queries about COVID - 19 or the policy updates ( Figure 3 , Appendix ) . Our results provide insight that in addition to the factors that may af - fect the social media adaptability within the institutions [ 63 ] , the communication mode and characteristics should also be considered in the success of such platforms’ adaptability . 5 . 2 Data - Driven Opportunities In our analysis , we look at the central entities in different countries and regions ; however , the discussion around health - related topics can be more localized in nature and may vary depending on the demographics [ 34 ] . The text analysis in comments can provide a detailed analysis of users’ opinions from diverse demographics . Our study shows that most of the discussions carried out by govern - mental accounts are general . However , these accounts tend to carry more dialogic components , such as ‘ @ ’ and ‘URLs’ in COVID - 19 discussions . More sophisticated analysis , such as natural language processing ( NLP ) and network analysis tools applied against the use of certain hashtags , mentions , and websites , can provide deeper causal analysis [ 13 , 30 ] . In parallel to opinion mining , our dataset shows that the video , which is one of the least effective types to get citizen engagement is also one of the most shared content types on these accounts . Governments need to understand user content consumption and engagement using historical data , to effectively communicate with citizens during a crisis . 5 . 3 Support for Inclusiveness The Human - Computer Interaction ( HCI ) and Computer - Supported Co - operative Work ( CSCW ) research communities have focused on designing spaces that could incorporate factors such as inclusive - ness , equality , and appreciation [ 18 , 33 , 55 , 64 ] . In times of distress , leaders’ social media presence and communication with the citizens can uplift people’s well - being [ 4 ] . For instance , many leaders ap - preciated the front - line workers , particularly health staff , as shown in Figure 3d . Alongside these appreciation posts , leaders shared news about economic relief and also rallied their communities for donations during the crisis . However , although these pages share information about donations funds , there are no proactive approaches to help those actions . For instance , Facebook has a feature for collecting donations and giving to charity 3 . We have not observed the gov - ernments using such functionalities in our data . We also note that 3 https : / / www . facebook . com / business / learn / lessons / tools - to - connect - donations - on - facebook 113 dg . o 2022 , June 15 – 17 , 2022 , Virtual Event , Republic of Korea Haq et al .

Leaders and departments should focus more on technological support to be more holistic in their approach . Overall , we note that social media is primarily used for its original goal : communication between the various stakeholders . Although social media platforms such as Facebook aim to become more pervasive by pushing other functionalities like fundraising , these functionalities are barely employed by governments . 5 . 4 Crisis , Communication Effectiveness , and Social Media Design In recent years , many social media platforms included support for crisis control . Facebook has developed functionalities for crisis re - sponse 4 , which allows users to mark themselves as safe in case of disasters . OSNs can control the propagation of factual information as compared to contradictory information [ 2 ] Another important consideration in social media design is the role of algorithmic rank - ings and content outreach . Political figures might not be able to reach certain groups of citizens who are possibly in a political echo - chamber . Such effect and mitigation during the crisis is an important future research direction . Our study allows us to understand what type of official infor - mation is the most effective and , thus , what kind of information social media platforms may bring forward in a given cultural con - text . Direct communication , as it is in the case of live videos , may help overcome misinformation issues and can be explored by the research community . For instance , live video streaming has been effectively used to spread reliable information during the 2018 stu - dents’ social movement in Bangladesh [ 1 ] . As such credible and relevant authorities can use social media to convey the correct information in a more direct way . Citizens increased interest and interactions with official social media during COVID - 19 have been reported [ 54 ] . Our comparative approach shows that health depart - ment pages saw a significant increase in terms of their follower across the countries , suggesting the need for niche - oriented social media presence to be more trustworthy and goal - oriented . 4 https : / / www . facebook . com / about / crisisresponse / 5 . 5 Limitation and Future Work Our study presents several limitations that we aim to address in future works . This work only provides empirical evidence of en - gagement parameters such as likes , shares , and comments and does not evaluate the message’s contents beyond the content categories . A future work based on comments analysis can help better un - derstand citizens’ responses [ 6 ] . Cautiously , engagement does not necessarily reflect effective communication . In some countries , the government channels may be able to manipulate the people’s opin - ions [ 1 ] , and citizens’ understanding of online content might be biased due to local policies [ 42 ] . The underlying information in social media posts may contain content that can cause more harm than good , as was the case in India during COVID - 19 [ 2 ] . A detailed analysis of such discourse can provide insight into the quality of information and its effects on society . Our sample of leaders also presents limitations . Most country leaders are political figures , and their following primarily relies on their partisan memberships , even though they represent the region at the time of analysis . As such , the content outreach from these leaders may be affected by the partisan preferences [ 62 ] . In future works , we will consider a larger sample of partisan leaders from more than one party to quantify better the effectiveness of political leaders’ communication during the crisis .
