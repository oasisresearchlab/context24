Here we show in a murine model of pemphigus , a prototypic cutaneous autoantibody - mediated disorder , that blood - circulating IgG extravasates into the skin in a time - and dose - dependent manner under homeostatic conditions . This IgG extravasation is unaffected by depletion of Fc γ receptors , but is largely attenuated by speci ﬁ c ablation of dynamin - dependent endocytic vesicle for - mation in blood endothelial cells ( BECs ) . Among dynamin - dependent endocytic vesicles , IgG co - localizes well with caveolae in cultured BECs . An Abl family tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib , which reduces caveolae - mediated endocytosis , impairs IgG extravasation in the skin and attenuates the murine pemphigus manifestations . Our study highlights the kinetics of IgG extravasation in vivo , which might be a clue to understand the pathological mechanism of autoantibody - mediated autoimmune disorders . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 12232 - 3 OPEN 1 Department of Dermatology , Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine , Kyoto , Japan . 2 Department of Dermatology , Keio University Graduate School of Medicine , Tokyo , Japan . 3 Research Unit / Immunology & In ﬂ ammation , Sohyaku , Innovative Research Division , Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation , Yokohama , Japan . 4 Department of Anatomy , Keio University School of Medicine , Tokyo , Japan . 5 Department of Experimental Immunology , Institute of Development , Aging and Cancer , Tohoku University , Sendai , Japan . 6 Singapore Immunology Network ( SIgN ) and Skin Research Institute of Singapore ( SRIS ) , Agency for Science , Technology and Research ( A * STAR ) , Biopolis , Singapore .

Considering the increased risk of cuta - neous bacterial infections in patients with primary agammaglo - bulinemia 1 , extravasation of Igs should exert essential protective immune functions especially in the skin . In addition , extravasa - tion of Igs in the skin might also be related to the establishment of pathogenic immune reactions , such as cutaneous urticaria mediated by IgEs or the occurrence of autoimmune skin blis - tering disorders by autoantibodies against epidermal adhesion molecules 2 – 4 . It was reported that blood - circulating IgE can bind to the high - af ﬁ nity Fc ε receptors of dermal perivascular mast cells , which elongate their dendrites through the blood vessel wall 5 . As for IgG , although we recently showed that local in ﬂ ammation enhances its extravasation 6 , the mechanisms of homeostatic IgG extravasation was left unaddressed . Understanding the molecular mechanism of this process is essential for the management of autoantibody - mediated disorders . Moreover , considering that antibody - based biologics or immune checkpoint inhibitors are globally accepted as strong tools for the treatment of autoimmune disorders and various cancers , this insight into the basic per - ipheral kinetics of IgG would serve as practical information in the clinic . Generally , there are two pathways of transvascular transport for plasma contents : paracellular ( passive transport ) and trans - cellular ( active transport ) 6 . Most blood vessels in peripheral tis - sues including the skin are composed of continuous blood vessels , and serve as a ﬁ rm physiological barrier against plasma contents . Since the barrier prevents paracellular diffusion of albumin ( Molecular size = 66 kilodalton [ kDa ] ) and dextran with a molecular size of over 70 kDa 7 – 9 , it seems unlikely that IgG ( 150 kDa ) takes the paracellular pathway under homeostatic conditions . Nevertheless , a variety of plasma macromolecules takes the transcellular pathway by means of receptors expressed in vesicles of blood endothelial cells ( BECs ) , which are derived from various forms of endocytosis 10 – 13 . Previous observations revealed the close localization of IgG and Fc γ receptors in vesi - cles , such as neonatal Fc receptor ( FcRn ) or Fc γ RIIb 14 – 18 . In addition , FcRn - unbound IgG is shown to enter into lysosomal degradation in BECs 19 – 23 . Although these studies implicate the importance of FcRn , Fc γ receptors , and endocytic vesicles for subcellular traf ﬁ cking of IgG , their actual contribution to IgG extravasation in vivo remains to be addressed . In relation to the transvascular transport , it was reported that a multityrosine kinase inhibitor , imatinib , relieved tissue edema upon in ﬂ ammation in murine models of acute lung injury and cerebral infarction 24 – 27 . Another study also pointed out that imatinib relieves IgE - mediated anaphylactic reaction in mice 28 . The ef ﬁ cacy of imatinib in these models is mainly attributed to the decreased paracellular permeability via inhibition of the Abl family of tyrosine kinases 25 , 26 , 28 . In addition , imatinib and another Abl inhibitor was shown to downregulate caveolae - mediated endocytosis in vitro in BECs 29 , 30 . We thus hypothesized that imatinib may also modulate IgG extravasa - tion in the skin under both in ﬂ ammatory and homeostatic conditions . Pemphigus vulgaris is a prototypic antibody - mediated disorder that targets a keratinocyte adhesion molecule , desmoglein ( Dsg ) 3 , among other targets . Herein , using a murine model of pem - phigus by targeting Dsg3 , we examined how extravasation of blood - circulating IgG is regulated under homeostatic conditions . With the passive murine model used in this study , we did not address initiation of autoantibody response or the target speci ﬁ - city , but simply focused on the kinetics of IgG extravasation in vivo . In addition , we evaluated the relevance of Fc γ receptors and the effect of imatinib and other Abl inhibitors on IgG extravasation in the skin . Results Blood - circulating IgG extravasates and reaches the epidermis . We employed a passive murine pemphigus model that can be induced by intravenous injection of antimurine Dsg3 antibodies ( Abs ) to mice 31 . Among various antimurine Dsg3 Ab clones , a pathogenic clone ( AK23 ) disrupts cell – cell adhesion between keratinocytes and induces hair loss in mice , but a nonpathogenic clone ( AK18 ) does not 31 ( Fig . 1a ) . Because the dissociation of keratinocytes may evoke local in ﬂ ammation that may hinder the subsequent analysis , we used AK18 to evaluate the kinetics of IgG extravasation in a sensitive and quantitative way . AK18 , which belongs to the IgG1 subtype , was injected intravenously from the tail vein to mice . Twenty - four hours later , the deposition of AK18 in the ear epidermis was quanti ﬁ ed by measuring the mean ﬂ uorescence intensity ( MFI ) of IgG1 in the CD45 − E - cadherin + keratinocytes by ﬂ ow cytometry ( hereafter referred to as IgG1 - MFI ) ( Fig . 1b ) . IgG1 - MFI started to elevate within 1 h and reached a plateau at 6 h after the intravenous injection ( Fig . 1c ) . The injection doses of AK18 were associated with dose - dependent increases in IgG1 - MFI ( r = 0 . 99 ; evaluated 24 h after the AK18 injection ) ( Fig . 1d ) . To re ﬂ ect high IgG1 - MFI , AK18 deposition in the epidermis was detectable by immunohistochemistry when mice received a high dose ( > 100 μ g ) of Ab as we previously reported 6 ( Fig . 1e ) . With injection of AK23 , the manifestation of hair loss and epidermal AK23 deposition in host mice were detected only under a high - injection dosage ( Fig . 1a , e ) . These results emphasize similar kinetics of AK18 and AK23 , and support the idea that the amount of autoantibody deposition is critical for the establishment of the pemphigus skin manifestation . In order to check whether nonspeci ﬁ c IgG , not restricted to anti - Dsg3 Abs , extravasates from the blood to the dermal interstitium under homeostatic conditions , we intravenously injected ﬂ uorescein - conjugated nonspeci ﬁ c mouse IgG to mice . Twenty - four hours later , by the whole mount immunohistochemistry of the split ear skin , we found that dermal macrophages were labeled , suggesting that they received extravasated IgG in the dermis ( Fig . 1f , g ) . These results con ﬁ rmed that the blood - circulating IgG , including autoantibodies , crosses over the blood vessel walls and distributes in the skin in a time - and circulating Ab dose - dependent manner under homeostatic conditions . Homeostatic IgG extravasation occurs transcellularily via BECs . To determine whether IgG extravasation takes place via the transcellular pathway or the paracellular pathway under homeostatic conditions , we examined IgG kinetics by intravital - imaging analysis of murine ears . We intravenously injected ﬂ uorescein - conjugated IgG and found that injected IgG retained in the blood circulation . The leakage of IgG to the dermal interstitium was not apparent for an hour ( Fig . 2a ) . Besides , the leakage of IgG was clearly demonstrated when local in ﬂ ammation was induced by topical phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) to the ears ( Fig . 2a and Supplementary Fig . 1A ) . On the other hand , internalization of AK18 in dermal BECs was detected by intra - cellular staining of IgG1 in the dermal BECs after an intravenous Ab injection ( Fig . 2b , c ) . Therefore , the transcellular pathway is likely the main route for homeostatic IgG extravasation in the skin . In the transcellular pathway , three major conventional ways are known for the formation of endocytic vesicles : caveolae - mediated endocytosis , clathrin - mediated endocytosis , and macropinocyto - sis 10 . Among them , dynamin governs endocytic membrane ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 12232 - 3 2 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2019 ) 10 : 4432 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 12232 - 3 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications ﬁ ssion and formation of caveolae - mediated and clathrin - mediated endocytic vesicles . To evaluate the role of dynamin - dependent vesicles in BECs for IgG extravasation , we mated VE - cadherin - CreERT2 transgenic mice with dynamin 1 and 2 double conditional knockout mice ( VE - cadherin - CreERT2 ; D1D2 - ﬂ oxed mice ) 32 , 33 . In these mice , the formation of both clathrin - mediated and caveolae - mediated endocytic vesicles was ablated selectively in BECs after the intraperitoneal injections of tamoxifen . We con ﬁ rmed by electron microscopy that vesicles in dermal BECs were diminished in Cre + mice after tamoxifen treatment compared with Cre − control mice ( Fig . 2d , red arrowheads ) . The interendothelial adhesion junction was unaffected in Cre + mice as well as Cre − control mice under homeostatic condition ( Fig . 2d , yellow arrows ) . In such condition , both epidermal AK18 deposition ( evaluated by IgG1 - MFI ) and internalization of AK18 in dermal BECs were reduced ( Fig . 2e , f ) . Consistently , the enhancement of dermal macrophages after intravenous injection of ﬂ uorescein - conjugated IgG was also attenuated in Cre + mice , and IgG retained in the blood circulation ( Supplementary Fig . 1B ) . These observations indicate that the transcellular pathway is responsible for homeostatic IgG extravasation to the skin , and that dynamin - dependent endocytic vesicles in BECs are favorable cargo beds . On the other hand , upon in ﬂ ammation with topical PMA application to the ears , the ear swelling levels was unaffected ( Fig . 2g ) , and the leakages of IgG to the interstitium were g Δ I g G 1 - M F I 10 4 10 3 10 2 1 10 100 1000 r = 0 . 99 10 a 0 I g G 1 - M F I I g G 1 - M F I 1000 500 0 1 3 6 24 Time ( h ) b c d E - c adhe r i n - F I T C CD45 - V450 PBSCtrl - mIgG1 AK18 % o f M a x IgG1 - APC CtrlmIgG1 0 200 400 600 100 80 60 40 20 0 0 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 0 0 10 2 10 2 10 3 10 3 10 4 10 4 10 5 10 5 * PBS * AK18 NS e f mIgG PBS 10 100 AK23 AK18 10 100 mIgG DAPI 10 μ g 100 μ g AK18 AK23 % o f m a c r ophage s 20 40 60 80 0 PBS mIgG ( μ g ) * PBS CtrlmIgG1 AK18 ( ⎛ g ) mIgG P < 0 . 001 Fig . 1 Kinetics of homeostatic IgG extravasation in the skin . a Manifestation of hair loss in mice 10 days after intravenous injection of AK18 or AK23 at 10 or 100 μ g . b A representative ﬂ ow cytometry plot and a histogram ( the left and middle panels ) to detect epidermal AK18 deposition in CD45 + E - cadherin + keratinocytes , and IgG1 - MFI ( the right panel ) in keratinocytes 24 h after intravenous injection of 20 μ g AK18 ( n = 4 ) , 20 μ g control mouse IgG1 ( Ctrl - mIgG1 ) ( n = 4 ) , or PBS ( n = 3 ) . * P < 0 . 05 ( a one - way ANOVA test ) .

In addition , epidermal AK18 deposition of Cre + mice was also comparable with that of control mice in in ﬂ amed ears ( Fig . 2h ) . These results suggest that the robust increase in the paracellular permeability upon in ﬂ ammation is unaffected in VE - cadherin - CreERT2 ; D1D2 - ﬂ oxed mice , and that the defect of transcellular IgG extravasation is negligible in such situations . Together with our previous report showing that epidermal IgG deposition was markedly increased in in ﬂ amed ears compared with untreated ears 6 , we concluded that the transcellular IgG - extravasation pathway is less important under in ﬂ ammatory conditions when paracellular leakage is dominant . Caveolae mediates IgG extravasation in the skin . We attempted to clarify which vesicles are responsible for homeostatic IgG extravasation . We cultured human dermal BECs ( HDBECs ) with ﬂ uorescein - conjugated human IgG and observed subcellular IgG distribution in HDBECs , which might be derived from active endocytosis . IgG in HDBECs colocalized with EEA1 , a marker of early endosomes , in foci within the cytoplasm ( stained with CellMask Green ) , while being resistant to the acid wash by acetic acid 34 , suggesting that IgG was internalized in HDBECs ( Fig . 3a and Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . We found that this IgG endocytosis by HDBECs was decreased when cultured with dynasore , an inhibitor of dynamin ( Fig . 3b ) . The result was consistent with the observations in VE - cadherin - CreERT2 ; D1D2 - ﬂ oxed mice ( Fig . 2e , f ) . To compare the dominance of clathrin - or caveolae - mediated endocytosis in IgG uptake , we conducted an immu - nocytochemical analysis . IgG taken up by HDBECs was circumscribed by or colocalized with caveolin 1 , the principal protein of caveolae , rather than with clathrin ( Fig . 3c ) . In addi - tion , IgG endocytosis was suppressed in HDBECs with a caveolae - conformation inhibitor , nystatin 35 ( Fig . 3d ) , or siRNA against caveolin 1 but not siRNA against clathrin ( Fig . 3e and Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . To study the effect of nystatin in vivo , we injected nystatin intraperitoneally before the intravenous AK18 administration , and evaluated epidermal IgG1 - MFI . Correspondingly , we found that nystatin pretreatment signi ﬁ cantly reduced epidermal AK18 deposition in mice ( Fig . 3f ) . These results suggest the dominant contribution of caveolae - mediated endocytosis in IgG extravasation . Fc γ receptors play negligible roles in IgG extravasation . As mentioned , many plasma macromolecules use their receptors expressed on the membrane of endocytic vesicles in the trans - cellular pathway .

Similar to the previous observations of placental BECs 14 , 18 , dermal BECs expressed low levels of Fc γ RIIb and / or Fc γ RIII and high levels of FcRn , but did not express Fc γ RI or Fc γ RIV ( Fig . 4a ) . To evaluate the role of Fc γ RIIb or Fc γ RIII for IgG extravasation in an in vivo setting , epidermal AK18 deposition was examined after intravenous Ab injection in Fc γ RIIb - de ﬁ cient mice 36 and FcRg - de ﬁ cient mice that lack the expression of Fc γ receptors other than Fc γ RIIb 37 . In both mouse strains , IgG1 - MFI was found to be comparable with that of wild - type mice ( Fig . 4b , c ) . As for FcRn , we further employed β 2 - microglobulin ( β 2m ) - de ﬁ cient mice that lack functional FcRn 38 . The reliability of FcRn de ﬁ ciency was ﬁ rst determined by evaluating transplacental AK18 transport to the fetal epidermis 39 . In brief , the β 2m - hemi - de ﬁ cient female mouse was mated with the β 2m - hemi - de ﬁ cient male mouse . Twenty - four hours after the intravenous adminis - tration of AK18 to the pregnant female mouse at gestational day 18 . 5 , fetuses were delivered by cesarean section , and AK18 deposition in the fetal epidermis was analyzed by ﬂ ow cytometry . Each fetal genotype was also examined . Supportively , AK18 deposition in the skin was completely blocked in β 2m - de ﬁ cient fetuses and half - reduced in β 2m - hemi - de ﬁ cient fetuses compared with wild - type littermates ( Fig . 4d ) . In contrast , in adult mice , epidermal AK18 deposition and serum AK18 levels in β 2m - de ﬁ cient mice were comparable with those in control mice 6 h after AK18 injection ( Fig . 4e ) . These results suggest that FcRn is not essential for homeostatic IgG extravasation in the skin . Of note , epidermal AK18 deposition was decreased at a later time point ( 24 h after injection ) in β 2m - de ﬁ cient mice ( Fig . 4f , left ) , likely re ﬂ ecting decreased serum AK18 levels caused by impaired IgG - recycling in BECs ( Fig . 4f , right ) . In addition , we applied intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIG ) treatment as an alternative way to block FcRn function . Consistent with the previous report 39 , IVIG at the dosage of 1 . 0 g kg − 1 day − 1 could completely prevent the transplacental AK18 transfer to fetuses ( Fig . 4g ) . In this condition , however , epidermal AK18 deposition in the adult mice was not prevented : epidermal AK18 deposition and the serum AK18 levels were comparable with that of control mice at 6 h after AK18 administration ( Fig . 4h ) , and both were partially decreased at 24 h after AK18 administration ( Fig . 4i ) . These results were compatible with the results of β 2m - de ﬁ cient mice ( Fig . 4d – f ) , and also supported our idea that FcRn is unessential for transvascular IgG transport in the skin . Considering these observations , we concluded that the extravasation of IgG in the skin is mediated without the support of Fc γ receptors , including Fc γ RIIb or FcRn . Imatinib reduces IgG extravasation in the skin .

These reports demonstrated the impact of imatinib under in ﬂ ammatory conditions . As such , we ﬁ rst eval - uated whether imatinib could reduce IgG extravasation in in ﬂ ammation . As we previously reported , the local skin in ﬂ ammation induced by various stimuli including topical PMA signi ﬁ cantly enhances autoantibody deposition in the epidermis in our murine pemphigus model 6 . We administered imatinib intraperitoneally to mice before the intravenous AK18 injection and found that imatinib reduced epidermal AK18 deposition in the in ﬂ amed ears ( Fig . 5a ) . Therefore , we assumed that imatinib regulated , at least in part , the paracellular permeability of IgG in our model . This observation is consistent with previous reports exhibiting the impact of imatinib on vascular permeability under in ﬂ ammatory conditions . The PMA - induced ear swellings were unaffected by imatinib ( Fig . 5b ) , probably due to the fact that the amount of ear swelling is determined not only by vascular permeability . Next , we examined the in ﬂ uence of imatinib on IgG extravasation under homeostatic conditions . We treated mice with imatinib or vehicle ( distilled water : dH 2 O ) before the AK18 administration , and found that epidermal AK18 deposition was suppressed in a dose - dependent manner by imatinib ( Fig . 5c ) . A high - dose imatinib pretreatment ( 6000 μ g body − 1 day − 1 ) almost completely blocked Ab deposition , even when AK18 was injected at a high dose ( up to 200 μ g body − 1 ) ( Fig . 5d ) . Serum AK18 levels were comparable between imatinib - and vehicle - pretreated mice ( Fig . 5e ) , while internalization of AK18 in dermal BECs was largely decreased ( Fig . 5f ) , similar to the results in VE - cadherin - CreERT2 ; D1D2 - ﬂ oxed mice ( Fig . 2d , e ) . These results suggest that Ab extravasation is blocked at the phase of IgG endocytosis in BECs by imatinib . We additionally tested if imatinib could also block extravasa - tion of nonspeci ﬁ c IgG . Pretreatment of imatinib prevented the internalization of IgG by dermal macrophages after an intrave - nous injection of ﬂ uorescein - conjugated mouse IgG ( Fig . 5g ) . This result suggests that IgG is constrained to the blood circulation by treatment with imatinib . Because this decrease in IgG uptake by dermal macrophages was recovered by an intradermal injection of IgG ( Fig . 5g ) , it is unlikely that imatinib Fc γ RIIb / III % o f M a x Fc γ RI 0 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 0 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 0 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 0 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 0 20 40 60 80 100 Sample % BEC _ BECiso _ 001 . fcs 85 . 3 BEC _ BEC _ 001 . fcs 85 . 2 0 20 40 60 80 100 Sample % NT _ iso _ 001 . fcs 94 . 8 NT _ CD16 , 2f , 32 _ 003 . fcs 82 . 3 c d a e Fc γ RIV Fc γ R - stain isotype - stain 0 20 40 60 80 100 Sample % CD31 - APC _ iso _ 004 . fcs 98 CD31 - APC _ FcgRIV _ 002 . fcs 97 . 2 b 0 1000 500 I g G 1 - M F I NS WT β 2m – / – β 2m – / – β 2m – / – NS A n t i - D s g3 A b ( U / m l ) 40 30 20 10 0 WT 0 20 40 60 80 100 FcRn WT WT 0 750 500 I g G 1 - M F I AK18 to mother PBS to mother NS β 2m + / – β 2m – / – 250 WT I g G 1 - M F I 500 1000 0 * 60 40 20 0 * A n t i - D s g3 A b ( U / m l ) β 2m – / – WT f I g G 1 - M F I WT 500 1000 0 1500 FcRg – / – NS 800 600 400 0 200 WT Fc γ RIIb – / – NS I g G 1 - M F I 0 1000 500 I g G 1 - M F I PBS IVIG NS NS A n t i - D s g3 A b ( U / m l ) 40 30 20 10 0 PBS IVIG g h 0 2000 1000 I g G 1 - M F I PBS IVIG PBS to mother AK18 to mother NS i NS PBS A n t i - D s g3 A b ( U / m l ) 40 30 20 10 0 IVIG PBS IVIG * I g G 1 - M F I 0 1000 500 1500 Fig . 4 Dispensable contribution of Fc γ receptors for homeostatic IgG extravasation in the skin . a Expression of each Fc γ receptor on BECs in the ear skin ( solid line ) .

Flow cytometric analysis yielded similar results , showing that the imatinib pretreatment reduced the percentage of ﬂ uorescein - positive dermal macrophages after an intravenous injection of ﬂ uorescein - conjugated mouse IgG , but not after an intradermal injection ( Fig . 5h ) . These results suggest that imatinib blocks IgG extravasation to the skin not only upon in ﬂ ammation but also under homeostatic conditions by interfering in both paracellular leakage of IgG as well as endocytosis of IgG in BECs . Abl family tyrosine kinases in BECs govern IgG extravasation . Imatinib is known to target the Abl family of nonreceptor tyr - osine kinases ( c - Abl and Arg ) and some membrane - bound tyr - osine kinase receptors such as platelet - derived growth factor receptor ( Pdgfr ) - α , Pdgfr - β , and c - Kit 40 . As mentioned , the ef ﬁ - cacy of imatinib on vascular permeability seems to be mainly attributed to the inhibition of Abl family tyrosine kinases 25 , 26 , 28 . Of note , a previous report proposed the effect of imatinib on regulating vascular permeability during ischemic stroke through its action on Pdgfr - α on pericytes 27 . This raises the possibility that tyrosine kinases other than those of the Abl family may also play a role in IgG extravasation . To de ﬁ ne the importance of Abl family tyrosine kinases on IgG extravasation , we examined the contribution of other membrane - bound tyrosine kinases ( Pdgfr - α , Pdgfr - β , and c - Kit ) on BECs . We analyzed the expression of these tyrosine kinase receptors on murine dermal BECs by ﬂ ow cytometric analysis , and found expression of Pdgfr - α , but not Pdgfr - β or c - Kit ( Supplementary Fig . 4A ) . We then pretreated mice with a suf ﬁ cient dose of an anti - Pdgfr - α blocking Ab , APA5 41 , before the AK18 administra - tion , however , epidermal AK18 deposition was not affected ( Supplementary Fig . 4B ) . We also examined the possible contribution of mast cells , since imatinib affects their functions by inhibiting c - Kit activity 42 . Dermal mast cells locate along blood vessels and were shown to have a potency to capture blood - circulating IgE via Fc ε receptors 5 . Because mast cells also possess Fc γ receptors ( Fc γ RIIb and / or Fc γ RIII but not Fc γ RI nor Fc γ RIV ) ( Supplementary Fig . 4C ) , we assumed that they might even be engaged in transferring IgG to tissue interstitium . Moreover , even under homeostatic conditions , subtle physiological stimuli may activate mast cells to induce histamine release and increase blood vessel permeability 6 . To reveal the role of mast cells in homeostatic IgG extravasation , we employed inducible mast cell - de ﬁ cient ( Mas - TRECK ) mice .

To further investigate the direct effect of Abl family tyrosine kinases on IgG extravasation , we examined IgG endocytosis by HDBECs that were exposed to siRNA against c - ABL . We con ﬁ rmed that IgG endocytosis by HDBECs was decreased when cultured with siRNA against c - ABL , as well as siRNA against caveolin 1 ( Fig . 6a ) . In addition , we conducted an in vitro transwell permeability assay using human dermal microvascular endothelial cells ( HDMECs ) . As expected , imatinib showed an inhibitory effect on thrombin - induced IgG transition through HDMECs in a dose - dependent manner ( Fig . 6b ) . Similarly , asciminib , another speci ﬁ c inhibitor of c - Abl tyrosine kinase 43 , also showed reduced IgG transition through HDMECs ( Fig . 6c ) . Inhibition of both Abl and Arg with GNF - 2 , which displays a greater target speci ﬁ city than imatinib and is not known to inhibit any additional kinases 44 , 45 , almost completely abolished IgG transition through HDMECs at concentrations > 1 μ M ( Fig . 6d ) . These results indicate that Abl family tyrosine kinases , including both c - Abl and Arg , are essential for IgG transport through BECs . We additionally evaluated the in vivo effect of reagents that have a speci ﬁ c effect on Abl family tyrosine kinases other than imatinib . We examined 5 - aminoimidazole - 4 - carboxamide ribo - nucleotide ( AICAR ) 30 , which was newly identi ﬁ ed to inhibit Abl phosphorylation by activating adenosine monophosphate - dependent kinase . Although increasing number of studies assessed the antimetabolic and immunomodulatory effect of AICAR and its analog in vivo 46 – 48 , its effect on IgG kinetics remains unknown . Pretreatment with AICAR was effective in reducing epidermal AK18 deposition ( Fig . 6e ) . These results support that Abl family tyrosine kinases in BECs play an essential role in homeostatic IgG extravasation in the skin . Imatinib reduces extravasation of IgG but not of dextran . To examine if the effect of imatinib is speci ﬁ c on caveolae and extravasation of IgG , mice were intravenously injected with Alexa - Fluor 594 ( A594 ) - conjugated mouse IgG together with ﬂ uorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) - conjugated 150 kDa dextran ( a similar molecular weight with IgG ) , which is generally con - sidered to be taken up by macropinocytosis and / or noncaveolae and clathrin - independent endocytosis 49 – 52 . Extravasation of both molecules was depicted as enhancement of dermal macrophages that engulfed these macromolecules ( Supplementary Fig . 5A ) . While imatinib reduced extravasation of IgG , it did not reduce the extravasation of 150 kDa dextran ( Supplementary Fig . 5A ) . Likewise , ﬂ ow cytometric analysis demonstrated that the per - centage of dermal macrophages that engulfed FITC - conjugated dextran was not decreased by the imatinib pretreatment ( Sup - plementary Fig . 5B ) . These results indicate the different extra - vasation routes of IgG and dextran , and suggest a selective effect of imatinib on caveolae - mediated endocytosis in BECs . Imatinib prevents the hair loss in a murine pemphigus model . We tested the possibility of regulating IgG extravasation as a therapeutic target for autoantibody - mediated disorders . Mice were treated with imatinib before the administration of a pathogenic autoantibody , AK23 . Imatinib attenuated the devel - opment of severe hair loss in mice ( Fig . 7a ) by preventing hair acantholysis ( the disruption of cell – cell adhesion between kera - tinocytes in the hair follicles ) ( Fig . 7b ) . AK23 deposition in interfollicular and follicular keratinocytes was ablated for 5 days after imatinib treatment ( Fig . 7c ) . Similar to the observation for AK18 ( Fig . 5e ) , serum AK23 levels were comparable between imatinib - and vehicle - treated mice until the elimination of injected AK23 from the blood ( Fig . 7d ) , suggesting that imatinib had a marginal effect on degradation or recycling of auto - antibodies . In contrast to intravenous injection , hair loss ( Fig . 7e ) and AK23 deposition in interfollicular and follicular keratinocytes ( Fig . 7f ) was not abrogated by imatinib after the intradermal injection of AK23 . This supports the idea that imatinib is likely to elicit its action via blocking Ab extravasation rather than inter - fering with Ab deposition to the epidermis or attenuation of its pathogenic activity . These observations suggest that imatinib has a potential to prevent the development of murine pemphigus skin manifestations . We additionally tested if imatinib could also block extravasa - tion of autoantibodies in mice obtained from pemphigus patients , capitalizing on the ability of pemphigus autoantibodies in humans to react with murine Dsgs 6 . Mice were intravenously injected with sera obtained from two pemphigus patients , who are positive for anti - Dsg3 Abs composed of IgG1 and IgG4 subclasses . By immunohistochemical analysis , we detected both human IgG1 and IgG4 deposition in the epidermis when mice were injected with 100 μ l of each patient ’ s serum , whereas it became undetectable with imatinib pretreatment ( Supplementary Fig . 6 ) . Taken together , these ﬁ ndings allowed us to consider that imatinib reduces the autoantibody deposition in the skin and protects from the autoantibody - mediated pathological changes . Discussion Our ﬁ ndings highlight a distinct pathway for homeostatic IgG extravasation in vivo and the impact of Abl family tyrosine kinases on IgG kinetics at the blood – tissue interface . Homeostatic IgG transport from the blood to the skin interstitium occurs via the transcellular pathway through dermal BECs , which uses IgG endocytosis by caveolae under the control of Abl family tyrosine kinases . Increasing number of studies pointed out the ef ﬁ cacy of inhibiting Abl family tyrosine kinases for regulating permeability of BECs in in ﬂ ammatory conditions ; which was , however , unknown for IgG kinetics and even for homeostatic conditions . In contrast to the previous considerations 22 , 23 , major Fc γ receptors seem to be dispensable for the IgG extravasation pro - cess . Although FcRn was mandatory for the transportation of IgG through the placenta ( Fig . 4d ) as we previously demonstrated 39 , FcRn was dispensable for transportation of IgG through the blood vessels to the skin interstitium . Consistently , we showed that extravasation of human pemphigus autoantibodies ( which belongs to either IgG1 or IgG4 ) to the skin was blocked by imatinib . It may also be possible that other subtypes of Igs share this transport mechanism , which requires further investigation . Our results also imply that there may be a distinct endocytic pathway for IgG , as opposed to dextran , that is generally con - sidered as a marker of ﬂ uid - phase endocytosis 49 . Although it is considered that IgG is also taken up by ﬂ uid - phase endocytosis by BECs 22 , there might be unknown factors or rules that govern the choice of endocytic vesicle as a cargo bed in BECs under various settings . In our study , it is possible that Abl family tyrosine kinases or the depletion of Fc γ receptors might have also affected the function of immune cells in vivo . However , since the dissociation of cell – cell adhesion between keratinocytes can be induced solely by deposition of anti - Dsg3 Ab to keratinocytes without con - tribution of immune cells 31 , we think that in our passive murine pemphigus model , we could evaluate the direct effect of Abl family tyrosine kinases on IgG kinetics . This insight into the basic IgG kinetics in vivo , as well as the ef ﬁ cacy of Abl family tyrosine kinases on IgG kinetics , may attract interest from both the immunological and the clinical ﬁ elds . At the same time , with the increasing attention to Abl family tyrosine kinases as a tool for treating not only cancerous but also noncancerous ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 12232 - 3 8 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2019 ) 10 : 4432 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 12232 - 3 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications diseases 26 , 28 , 42 , 46 – 48 , we should also note that these reagents can be of aid in the dysregulation of host immunity by reducing IgG concentration in the peripheral tissues . The extravasation of IgG should be bene ﬁ cial for the host defense against infectious pathogens in peripheral tissues , and yet can also trigger autoantibody - mediated manifestations , as such demonstrated in our murine pemphigus model . Our observations were consistent with previous in vitro reports that indicate the importance of c - Abl on caveolae - mediated endo - cytosis 29 , 30 . We propose that the strategy to block Abl family tyrosine kinases , such as by imatinib or AICAR , might be a useful alternative in the treatment of autoantibody - mediated disorders . Although it is important to note that the ef ﬁ cacy of these drugs might vary among target tissues due to the differ - ences in the rigidity of the intercellular barrier of blood capil - laries , as well as the dependency on the transcellular pathway for IgG extravasation 7 . Autoantibody - mediated encephalitis or retinopathy can be other targets , considering the tight blood barrier structures in these tissues . On the other hand , con - sidering the ef ﬁ cacy of imatinib on IgG extravasation upon in ﬂ ammation ( Fig . 5a ) , together with its effect on pathological vascular hyperpermeability 24 – 26 , imatinib might also be useful even with disruption of the blood vessel barrier . We did not precisely exclude the effect of imatinib on the paracellular IgG diffusion in the skin under both homeostatic and in ﬂ ammatory condition in this study , which would be another important issue to address in the future . Besides , we found that imatinib had little effect on the transition of serum anti - Dsg3 Ab titers . Although the de ﬁ nite mechanism is still undiscovered , it seems to be consistent with the notion that BECs not only recycle but also degrade the internalized IgG 23 , 53 . We assume that both the degradation and recycling processes were inhibited by blocking the endocytosis of IgG , resulting in equivalent serum auto - antibody titers . Conversely , our study has several limitations and issues to be solved . First , it remains unsolved how Abl family tyrosine kinases are activated under homeostatic conditions , although previous reports implied that physiological oxidative stresses to BECs might be involved in this process 29 , 30 . Second , the contribution of other molecules such as c - Src kinase in regulating IgG extra - vasation needs to be clari ﬁ ed . Although it is considered that imatinib has low af ﬁ nity to c - Src kinase 54 , c - Src kinase is also known to govern caveolar function ; 55 therefore , intervention of other unknown molecules might be undeniable . As mentioned , our most important query is whether Abl family tyrosine kinases can be applied to treat autoantibody - mediated disorders . On this , we are now undergoing a clinical trial of imatinib in patients with autoimmune - blistering diseases in Kyoto University Hospital ( The study is registered with the UMIN Clinical Trials Registry , number UMIN000030865 ) . In conclusion , our study provided insights into the kinetics of IgG extravasation in vivo and revealed a previously unknown immunomodulatory aspect of inhibitors for Abl family tyrosine kinases , including imatinib , against autoantibody - mediated 10 15 PBS 1000 500 0 I g G 1 - M F I AICAR ( mg ) a b e c 10 0 . 1 1 Imatinib ( μ M ) Thrombin 1000 3000 2000 0 10 0 . 1 1 Asciminib ( μ M ) Thrombin 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 F l uo r e sc en c e F l uo r e sc en c e 20 10 ThrombinGNF - 2 ( μ M ) 1000 3000 2000 0 F l uo r e sc en c e 1 0 . 1 d 4000 2000 0 Non - targetingsiRNA CAV1 siRNA Δ A 594 - M F I ABL1 siRNA hIgG DAPI C AV 1 s i RN A N on - t a r ge t i ng s i RN A AB L1 s i RN A PBS AK18 – – – – – – Fig . 6 Abl family tyrosine kinase inhibitors reduce IgG transport through BECs . a The left panels show hIgG distribution in BECs treated with siRNA that targets caveolin 1 ( CAV1 ) , c - ABL ( ABL1 ) , or nontargeting siRNA .

A better understanding of the IgG kinetics might serve as an asset in the search for therapeutics of autoantibody - mediated disorders , and also in host immunity . Methods Mice . Female 8 - to 10 - week - old C57BL / 6 - background mice were used in this study unless otherwise indicated . The age of mice used in AK23 trials was between 9 and 10 weeks old . C57BL / 6 and BALB / c mice were purchased from SLC ( Shizuoka , Japan ) . Fc γ RIIb - de ﬁ cient mice 36 and FcRg - de ﬁ cient mice 37 were gifted from Dr T . Takai , and both mouse strains were backcrossed with C57BL / 6 mice for at least more than ten generations before the experiments . β 2m - de ﬁ cient mice were gifted from Dr Y . Hamasaki 56 . Mas - TRECK mice were as described previously 57 , and to deplete mast cells in vivo , 250 ng of diphtheria toxin dissolved in 200 μ l of PBS was intraperitoneally injected to Mas - TRECK mice for 5 consecutive days . The experiments were conducted the next day following the last injection of diphtheria toxin . VE - cadherin - CreERT2 transgenic mice 33 were mated with dynamin 1 and 2 double conditional knockout mice 32 to establish VE - cadherin - CreERT2 ; D1D2 - ﬂ oxed mice . Both strains were kindly gifted from Dr Y . Kubota , and mice were backcrossed with C57BL / 6 mice for at least more than ten generations before the mating . Two milligrams of tamoxifen ( Sigma Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) was dissolved in 200 μ l of ethanol / sun ﬂ ower oil ( 1 : 8 ) and intraperitoneally injected to mice for 5 consecutive days . The experiments were conducted 6 – 7 days after the last injection of tamoxifen . Cre negative littermates were used as controls . Passive murine pemphigus model . Hybridoma cells that produce pathogenic ( AK23 ) and nonpathogenic ( AK18 ) anti - mouse Dsg3 monoclonal antibodies were provided from Keio Unversity 31 . To obtain antibodies , these cells were cultured in GIT medium ( Wako , Tokyo , Japan ) at 37°C for 14 days and IgG was puri ﬁ ed from culture supernatant using a Protein G HiTrap column ( GE Healthcare , Uppsala , Sweden ) . For ﬂ ow cytometric analysis , 100 μ g ( to check IgG1 - MFI in untreated ears ) or 20 μ g ( to check IgG1 - MFI in in ﬂ amed ears ) of AK18 was intravenously administered to mice via the tail vein , and the ear skin was collected 24 h later unless otherwise indicated . For immunohistochemical analysis , 100 μ g of AK23 was intravenously administered via the tail vein , and the ear skin was collected 1 – 5 days later . Otherwise , 50 or 5 μ g of AK23 was intradermally administered to the back skin or the ear skin of mice , respectively . Hair loss started 4 – 5 days after AK23 injection , and progressed until 10 days after AK23 injection . The images of hair loss were obtained 10 days after AK23 injection . The serum levels of anti - mouse Dsg3 Ab were analyzed using an enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) kit ( MBL , Nagoya , Japan ) according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions . Cell isolation and ﬂ ow cytometry . To obtain a single - cell suspension from the epidermis , the dorsal halves of mouse ears were ﬂ oated on 5 mgml − 1 dispase II ( Godo Shusei Co . , LTD , Tokyo , Japan ) dissolved in RPMI 1640 ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) containing 10 % fetal calf serum ( FCS ) for 30 min at 37 °C . Subse - quently , the epidermis was manually separated from the dermis by ﬁ ne tweezers . The epidermis was then ﬂ oated on 0 . 25 % trypsin - EDTA for 8min at 37 °C and ﬁ ltered through a 70 - μ m nylon mesh .

Anti - mouse c - Kit ( Cat . 17 - 1171 - 83 , clone 288 ) , Fc ε RI ( Cat . 11 - 5898 - 85 , clone MAR - 1 ) , and Pdgfr - β ( Cat . 12 - 1402 - 81 , clone APB5 ) Abs were purchased from eBioscience ( San Diego , CA ) . Anti - mouse FcRn Ab ( Cat . AF6775 ) was purchased from R & D systems ( Minneapolis , MN ) , and stained subsequently with anti - goat A647 secondary Ab ( Invitrogen ) . Fixable viability dye ( Cat . 65 - 0865 - 18 , eBioscience ) was used to exclude dead cells . To check IgG1 - MFI in the epidermis , epidermal cells were stained with antibodies against CD45 , E - cadherin , and IgG1 , then ﬁ xed with Cyto ﬁ x / Cytoperm ( Cat . 51 – 2090KZ , BD Bioscience ) , and underwent ﬂ ow cytometric analysis . We gated CD45 − E - cadherin + fraction to exclude intraepidermal immune cells and cell - debris . To evaluate cell - internalized IgG1 in dermal BECs , dermal cells were stained with ﬁ xable viability dye , antibodies against CD31 , gp38 , Ter119 , and CD45 . Cells were then ﬁ xed and permeabilized with Cyto ﬁ x / Cytoperm and Perm wash ( Cat . 51 - 2091KZ , BD Bioscience ) , and underwent intracellular staining with anti - mouse IgG1 antibody for ﬂ ow cytometric analysis . To detect the extravasation of nonspeci ﬁ c IgG or dextran in the murine ears by ﬂ ow cytometry , 100 – 200 μ g of ﬂ uorescein ( A647 ) - conjugated mouse IgG ( Cat . 015 - 600 - 003 , Jackson ImmunoResearch , West Grove , PA ) and / or 1 mg of FITC - conjugated 150kDa dextran ( Sigma Aldrich ) was intravenously injected via tail vein to mice or was intradermally injected to the ears of mice . The dermal cell suspension was collected after extraction of epidermis with dispase II , and subsequently digested with liberase TL , as mentioned above . Cells were stained with ﬁ xable viability dye , anti - mouse CD45 , CD11c , CD11b , MHC classII , and F4 / 80 . Cells were then ﬁ xed with Cyto ﬁ x / Cytoperm for ﬂ ow cytometric analysis . Flow cytometric analysis was performed using LSR Fortessa ( BD Bioscience ) and analyzed by FlowJo software ( Tree Star , Ashland , OR ) . The exact sequential gating strategy of dermal BECs is located in Fig . 2b . The gating strategies to check Ab deposition to epidermis and dermal macrophages are located as Supplementary Fig . 7A and 7B . Also , gating strategies of mast cells are located as Supplementary Fig . 7C . Time - lapse imaging of blood - circulating IgG by two - photon microscopy . Female 8 - week - old BALB / c mice were used for intravital - imaging analysis to avoid the in ﬂ uence of melanin . Mice were positioned on the heating - plate on the stage of a two - photon microscope , IX - 81 ( Olympus , Tokyo , Japan ) , and their ear lobes were ﬁ xed beneath cover slips with a single drop of immersion oil . Subsequently , 5mg of human polyclonal IgG ( Nihon Pharmaceutical Co . LTD , Tokyo , Japan ) labeled with FITC ( Sigma Aldrich ) was injected via the tail vein . Stacks of 15 images , spaced 3 . 5 μ m apart , were acquired every minute for 1h . To evaluate in vivo IgG kinetics , the single color - scale images of ﬂ uorescein were obtained and converted to rainbow color - scale images according to ﬂ uorescent intensity using ImageJ soft - whare 58 . Then , the blood vessel area and the interstitial space were manually circumscribed 9 , and the MFI of each area at each time point was calculated using ImageJ software . To induce skin in ﬂ ammation , 20 μ l of PMA ( 0 . 1 mg ml − 1 in acetone ; Sigma Aldrich ) was painted on the ear 24h before the IgG injection . Immunohistochemistry of the murine ear skin . To detect AK23 - induced hair acantholysis , a disruption of cell – cell adhesion between follicular keratinocytes , the murine dorsal skin samples were obtained 4 days after intravenous injection of AK23 , ﬁ xed in 10 % formaldehyde , and embedded in paraf ﬁ n . Samples were then sliced at 5 μ m , deparaf ﬁ nized , and underwent hematoxylin and eosin staining . To detect epidermal AK18 or AK23 deposition in the ear skin , the ear skin samples were obtained 24h after intravenous injection of antibodies , ﬁ xed in 4 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) , and embedded in O . C . T . compound ( Sakura Finetek , Torrance , CA ) . Five micrometers of slices were treated with Image - iT FX signal enhancer ( Invitrogen ) , and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with goat anti - mouse IgG A594 secondary Ab ( Invitrogen ) . PBS or control mouse IgG1 ( Cat . 400166 , clone MOPC - 21 , BioLegend ) was injected as negative controls . The slices were mounted with ProLong Diamond Antifade Mountant with DAPI ( Life Technologies , Carlsbad , CA ) . To detect epidermal autoantibody deposition after injecting sera from pemphigus patients , sera from two pemphigus vulgaris patients ( PV # 1 and PV # 2 ) , who were positive for anti - Dsg3 Ab but not anti - Dsg1 Ab , were collected for the analysis . Among the IgG1 - IgG4 subclasses , both sera were positive for the IgG1 and IgG4 subclasses . The ears of mice were collected 24 h after intravenous injection of each serum , then ﬁ xed , mounted , and stained with anti - human IgG FITC ( Abcam , Cambridge , UK ) . With intravenous injection of each serum of PV # 1 and PV # 2 to adult mice via the tail vein , we determined that at least 100 μ l of each patient ’ s serum was required to obtain apparently positive results in the untreated ears . Due to the limitation of the serum amount , the experiments using patients ’ sera were performed in a single mouse and its control , twice , with similar results for each serum . To detect the extravasation of nonspeci ﬁ c IgG or dextran in the murine ears by immunohistochemistry , 100 – 200 μ g of ﬂ uorescein ( A555 or A594 ) - conjugated mouse IgG ( Cat . 015 - 160 - 003 or 015 - 600 - 003 , Jackson ImmunoResearch , West Grove , PA ) and / or 1mg of FITC - conjugated 150kDa dextran ( Sigma Aldrich ) was intravenously injected via the tail vein to mice . Otherwise , 20 μ g of ﬂ uorescein - conjugated mouse IgG was intradermally injected to the ears . The ears of mice were collected 24h after injection and the dorsal halves of the ears were ﬂ oated on 4 % PFA at 4 °C for a day . The ears were mounted with ProLong Diamond Antifade Mountant without DAPI ( Life Technologies , Carlsbad , CA ) . These samples were observed under a ﬂ uorescent microscope , BZ - 900 ( KEYENCE , Osaka , Japan ) or a confocal microscope ( Nikon , Tokyo , Japan ) . Reagents and in vivo blocking assay . To block caveolae - mediated endocytosis , mice were intraperitoneally treated with 8 mgkg − 1 body weight of nystatin ( Sigma Aldrich ) 1h before AK18 administration . Ear samples were evaluated for IgG1 - MFI 6h after AK18 administration . Nystatin was ﬁ rst dissolved in dimethyl sulf - oxide ( DMSO ) at 25 mgml − 1 , and diluted to the ﬁ nal concentration of 1 mgml − 1 in distilled water ( dH 2 O ) . DMSO dissolved in dH 2 O was used as the vehicle . To block c - Abl , mice were intraperitoneally treated with imatinib mesylate ( 5 – 150 mg kg − 1 body weightday − 1 dissolved in dH 2 O ) ( Wako ) twice a day for 2 consecutive days before the administration of AK18 , AK23 , ﬂ uorescence - conjugated mouse IgG , or ﬂ uorescence - conjugated dextran . For the evaluation of hair loss , the development of hair loss in the back skin was evaluated for 10 days post AK23 administration , pretreated with imatinib or dH 2 O ( n = 10 or 13 , respectively ) . Alternatively , AICAR ( Toronto Research Chemicals , Toronto , Canada ) was dissolved in dH 2 O and subcutaneously administrated 1 day at 0 . 5 – 0 . 75 mgkg − 1 body weight day − 1 before AK18 administration . To block Pdgfr - α in vivo , mice were intravenously treated with 1mg of APA5 ( Cat . 562171 , clone APA5 , BD Bioscience ) or 1 mg of control rat IgG 24h before the administration of AK18 . To block FcRn function , IVIG at 1 . 0g kg − 1 day − 1 ( human IgG obtained from Nihon Pharmaceutical Co . Ltd , Tokyo , Japan ) was injected intravenously via the tail vein for 3 consecutive days to adult mice or pregnant mice ( from E15 . 5 to E17 . 5 ) . AK18 was administered at 100 μ g together with the ﬁ nal IVIG administration . For the analyses , the ears of adult mice were collected the following day . The fetuses were delivered at E18 . 5 by cesarean section , and the dorsal skin was extracted for cell isolation and ﬂ ow cytometry . Cell culture and in vitro IgG endocytosis assay . HDBECs were purchased from PromoCell ( Heidelberg , Germany ) and cultured in endothelial cell growth medium MV ( PromoCell ) at 37 °C in 5 % CO 2 until reaching 70 – 80 % con ﬂ uency . For the IgG endocytosis assay , cells were incubated in the presence of A594 - conjugated human IgG ( Cat . 009 - 580 - 003 , 10 μ gml − 1 ; Jackson ImmunoResearch ) for 1 h . To block dynamin function , cells were treated with dynasore ( 100 μ g ml − 1 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Dallas , TX ) for 30 min . To block caveolae - mediated endocytosis , cells were cultured with nystatin ( 50 μ gml − 1 ; Sigma Aldrich ) for 30min . To evaluate the quantity of engulfed IgG in each cell , the cytoplasmic area of cells in a high - power ﬁ eld ( ×40 ) was manually circumscribed using ImageJ 58 , and the MFI of the signals from A594 - IgG was measured . Δ A594 - IgG was calculated by sub - tracting the background MFI . Immunocytochemistry of HDBECs . For immunocytochemistry , HDBECs were incubated with A594 - conjugated human IgG ( Cat . 009 - 580 - 003 , 10 μ gml − 1 ; Jackson ImmunoResearch , West Grove , PA ) for 1h , ﬁ xed with 4 % PFA for 1h at 4 °C , permeabilized with 0 . 1 % triton - X100 in 1 % bovine serum albumin / PBS , and blocked with Image - iT FX signal enhancer ( Invitrogen ) before the staining . Sub - sequently , cells were incubated with anti - EEA - 1 Ab ( Cat . 2411 , Cell Signaling Technology , Danvers , MA ) at room temperature for 1 h , washed and incubated with anti - rabbit IgG A488 dye ( Invitrogen ) for 30 min at room temperature , and mounted with ProLong Diamond Antifade Mountant with DAPI ( Life Technol - ogies ) . Alternatively , cells were incubated with HCS CellMask ™ Green Stain ( Cat . H32714 , Invitrogen ) at 2 μ g ml − 1 for 30min at room temperature , and mounted . Otherwise , cells were stained with anti - caveolin 1 Ab ( Cat . ab2910 , Abcam ) or anti - clathrin Ab ( Cat . ab21679 , Abcam ) overnight at 4 °C , incubated with anti - rabbit IgG A488 dye ( Invitrogen ) for 30min at room temperature on the following day , and mounted . For the acid wash 34 , cells were washed with 0 . 2M acetic acid in 150 mM NaCl at 4°C after the IgG endocytosis assay and before the ﬁ xation . These slides were observed under a ﬂ uorescent microscope , BZ - 900 ( KEYENCE ) . Transwell permeability assay . HDMECs ( PromoCell ) were purchased and cul - tured in endothelial cell growth medium MV ( PromoCell ) at 37°C in 5 % CO 2 until reaching 70 – 80 % con ﬂ uency . HDMECs were collected with the DetachKit ( Pro - mocell ) and plated on the insert plates of Millicell - 96 transwell ( Merck Millipore , Darmstadt , Germany ) at 5×10 4 cells in 75 μ l medium / well . Two hundred and ﬁ fty microliters of medium was added to the receiver plate and incubated for 2 days at 37°C in 5 % CO 2 . The insert plates were then replaced to the new receiver plate . The medium was aspirated from the insert plates , and new medium with imatinib , NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 12232 - 3 ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2019 ) 10 : 4432 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 12232 - 3 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications 11 asciminib , or GNF - 2 was added at 50 μ l / well at various concentrations as indicated in each ﬁ gure , and incubated for 3h . Asciminib and GNF - 2 were synthesized in Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation . Subsequently , 10 μ l of FITC - conjugated human IgG at 187 . 5 μ gml − 1 ( Jackson ImmunoResearch ) was added to the insert plates , and incubated for 30min . Ten microliters of thrombin was added at 5Uml − 1 and incubated for another 60min . Finally , the insert plates were removed , and ﬂ uorescence intensity of the FITC - conjugated human IgG in the receiver plates was measured by EnVision ( PerkinElmer , Waltham , MA ) . In vitro siRNA assay . The following control siRNA and siRNA that targets caveolin 1 ( CAV1 ) , clathrin heavy chain ( CLTC ) , or c - ABL ( ABL1 ) were pur - chased from GE healthcare ( Pollards Wood , UK ) : Accell human CAV1 siRNA - SMART pool ( Cat . E - 003467 - 00 - 0005 ) , Accell human CLTC siRNA - SMART pool ( Cat . E - 004001 - 00 - 0005 ) , Accell human ABL1 siRNA - SMART pool ( Cat .

Brie ﬂ y , HDBECs were cultured in endothelial cell growth medium MV ( PromoCell ) with 5 % serum concentration , at 37 °C in 5 % CO 2 , until reaching 40 – 50 % con ﬂ uency . The medium was then exchanged to siRNA containing MV medium with 2 . 5 % serum concentration , and cultured for another 3 days at 37 °C in 5 % CO 2 . Down regulation of each mRNA expression was veri ﬁ ed at this time point by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction . Subsequently , the medium was again exchanged to MV medium with 5 % serum concentration , and cells were cultured for additional 3 days at 37°C in 5 % CO 2 . After that , immunohistochemistry to check the down regulation of protein expression of caveolin 1 and clathrin , and the IgG endocytosis assay were performed as mentioned . Quantitative PCR analysis . Total RNA was isolated from the cells lysed in buffer RLT by the RNeasy Mini kit ( Qiagen , Hilden , Germany ) . cDNA was synthesized with a PrimeScript RT reagent kit and random hexamers according to the man - ufacturer ’ s protocol ( TaKaRa , Shiga , Japan ) . A LightCycler 480 and LightCycler SYBR Green I Master mix were used according to the manufacturer ’ s protocol ( Roche ) for quantitative PCR ( primer sequences are as follows : CAV1 ; Forward , CTGTCGGAGCGGGACATC / Reverse , TGTTTAGGGTCGCGGTTGAC .
