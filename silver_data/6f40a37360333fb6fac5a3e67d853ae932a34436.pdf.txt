Examining the Production of Co - active Channels on YouTube and BitChute Matthew C . Childs and Benjamin D . Horne School of Information Sciences , The University of Tennessee , Knoxville , Knoxville , TN , USA mchilds3 @ vols . utk . edu , bhorne6 @ utk . edu Abstract A concern among content moderation researchers is that hard moderation measures , such as banning content produc - ers , will push users to more extreme information environ - ments . Research in this area is still new , but predominately focuses on one - way migration ( from mainstream to alt - tech ) due to this concern . However , content producers on alt - tech social media platforms are not always banned users from mainstream platforms , instead they may be co - active across platforms . We explore co - activity on two such platforms : YouTube and BitChute . Speciﬁcally , we describe differences in video production across 27 co - active channels . We ﬁnd that the majority of channels use signiﬁcantly more moral and political words in their video titles on BitChute than in their video titles on YouTube . However , the reasoning for this shift seems to be different across channels . In some cases , we ﬁnd that channels produce videos on different sets of top - ics across the platforms , often producing content on BitChute that would likely be moderated on YouTube . In rare cases , we ﬁnd video titles of the same video change across the plat - forms . Overall , there is not a consistent trend across co - active channels in our sample , suggesting that the production on alt - tech social media platforms does not ﬁt a single narrative . Introduction As disinformation , misinformation , and hate speech con - tinue to infect social media platforms , researchers continue to focus on methods to limit the visibility and consumption of bad content . These efforts have lead to a wide range of potential solutions , from banning repeat offenders to quar - antining communities to placing warning labels on content . Some of these solutions are automated by machine learning while others are completely human - powered solutions . While progress on content moderation has been made , a primary concern among researchers is the impact of hard moderation measures , such as banning users from a social media platform . Speciﬁcally , researchers are concerned that deplatforming efforts might end up pushing users to more toxic environments , perhaps mitigating the pro - social bene - ﬁt of banning users in the ﬁrst place ( Russo et al . 2022 ) . Due to this concern , recent research has focused on movement from one platform to another , in which a content producer is banned from or intervened with on one platform , leaves , Copyright © 2023 and starts producing content on another . These studies have provided evidence that some users do indeed migrate from one platform to another after a moderation event , and sub - sequently can increase their toxic behaviors ( Ali et al . 2021 ; Horta Ribeiro et al . 2021 ) . Although , importantly , the au - diences of the toxic content producers decreases after the movement ( Ali et al . 2021 ) , and in some cases the activ - ity of migrants themselves decreases after the movement ( Horta Ribeiro et al . 2021 ) . There are some additional com - plexities to this evidence . For example , in the case of toxic Reddit communities , subreddits where the banned commu - nity migrants went to did not inherit the toxicity of the banned communities ( Chandrasekharan et al . 2017 ) . Hence , a generalized understanding of user migrations and their im - pacts remains unclear . Under this umbrella of work , the primary focus has been one - way migration ( migration from one platform to another ) usually as a result of being deplatformed . However , one - way migration is only one of several potential side - effects of content moderation . For many content producers , it is not necessarily a choice of being on one platform or the other , but instead content producers may operate accounts across the both mainstream and alternative platforms . For example , content producers who have not been banned but still perceive a slight from content moderation , from actions such as being demonetized , having warning labels placed on their content , or the banning of another inﬂuencer within a speciﬁc toxic community , may begin producing content in an alternative space without leaving the mainstream plat - form . The primary concern here is not just that users may end up in more toxic environments , but that they will end up in more toxic environments while still having the affor - dances of mainstream platforms , possibly creating bridges to bring consumers with them to alternative spaces . Re - cently , work by Russo et al . ( 2022 ) provided evidence that “ spillovers ” of antisocial behavior can occur between alter - native and mainstream platforms through co - active users . Speciﬁcally , they showed that co - active users were more an - tisocial on the mainstream platform than other users of the mainstream platform , and that this effect escalated over time with exposure to the fringe platform . Outside of this work , which focused on toxic Reddit communities co - activity with fringe platforms , co - active behavior has been relatively un - explored . a r X i v : 2303 . 07861v1 [ c s . C Y ] 14 M a r 2023 To this end , we describe co - active behavior across two dif - ferent mainstream and alternative platforms : YouTube and BitChute ( a fringe alternative to YouTube ( Trujillo et al . 2020 ) ) . Speciﬁcally , in this short paper we ask two basic questions : • RQ1 : How do co - active content producers differ in their production across YouTube and BitChute ? • RQ2 : How do co - active content producers change con - tent toxicity and language across YouTube and BitChute ? To explore these questions , we collect and analyze a unique dataset of videos and comment metadata from 27 matched channels on YouTube and BitChute between Oc - tober 2020 and October 2021 . Using this dataset , we found that many content producers do not use signiﬁcantly dif - ferent language in their video titles across YouTube and BitChute , despite many videos not being exact copies of each other . However , there are some notable exceptions to this generalization . In particular , we found that the majority of channels use more moral ( e . g . wrong , honor , deserve , judge ) and polit - ical ( e . g . united states , govern , congress , senate ) words in their video titles on BitChute than in their video titles on YouTube . The reasoning for this shift seems to be different across channels . In some cases , we ﬁnd that channels pro - duce videos on different sets of topics across the platforms , often producing content on BitChute that would likely be moderated on YouTube . In other cases , this shift was due to the timing of videos produced . For example , a channel may produce more videos on YouTube early in the time frame , discussing a speciﬁc event , and then produce more videos on BitChute later in the time frame , discussing a new set of events . Broadly , these inconsistencies suggest that the pro - duction on and movement to alt - tech social media platforms does not ﬁt a single narrative . Data and Methods Our methods are loosely inspired by Horta Ribeiro et al . ( 2021 ) , in which the authors examine toxic communities af - ter those communities move to new platforms after modera - tion measures from their original platform . In our case , we are examining concurrent behavior , rather than before and after an intervention . Further , our study is focused on video content creators rather than members of discussion commu - nities . These differences change some of our methods of analysis , but the tools used to measure language are roughly the same . Data First , we start with a dataset of YouTube and BitChute channels that were linked to in U . S . election fraud discussions on Twitter , compiled in Childs et al . ( 2022 ) . The authors combined two publicly - available datasets : the VoterFraud2020 dataset ( Abilov et al . 2021 ) and the MeLa - BitChute dataset ( Trujillo et al . 2022 ) to ﬁnd these channels . From this mapping , the authors produced 13K unique videos from 5084 YouTube channels and 342 BitChute channels that were linked to Tweets discussing U . S . election fraud . The authors found that 36 of the producers ( out of the to - tal 5426 channels ) had both YouTube and BitChute chan - nels . This matching was done using Levenshtein distance between channel names . Using this set of matching channels , we manually conﬁrm that each channel is a legitimate match and ﬁlter out chan - nels that do not have more than 20 videos produced during the whole time frame , leaving us with 27 matched channels . We then collect all YouTube and BitChute videos produced between October 2020 and October 2021 by each chan - nel . The dataset contains 18 , 815 videos from 27 matched channels . From YouTube , there are 5 , 610 videos , while on BitChute there are 13 , 205 videos . To the best of our knowl - edge , nearly all videos produced by the channels during the time frame are present in the dataset . Hence , as a whole , these channels produced more videos on BitChute during the time frame . We start with this seed dataset to operationalize the task of ﬁnding matched channels , as ﬁnding all matched channels across YouTube and BitChute is infeasible given the size of YouTube . Analysis Using this dataset , we analyze the differences between each matched content producer’s YouTube chan - nel and BitChute channel using LIWC - 22 and Perspective API . Speciﬁcally , we compute language features on each channel’s video titles across the two platforms . Using these features , we compare differences in video title composition across the platforms using Tukey’s honestly signiﬁcant dif - ference ( HSD ) test . Tukey’s HSD test is a method of testing for signiﬁcant difference between the means of a set of sam - ples . The test uses the difference of the samples to determine which pairs of samples in the presented sample set are sig - niﬁcantly different from one another . The null hypothesis is that samples share the same mean , as such , a signiﬁcant p - value indicates that each of a pair of samples is likely not drawn from the same distribution .

Results Channel Descriptions To add some context to the set of content producers we are examining , we provide some metadata of the channels . These channels ranged from 100 to 1 , 460 , 000 subscribers on YouTube and 166 to 144 , 000 subscribers on BitChute . Several of these channels are by well - known content producers in the alt - right space . Given our sampling method , the channels mostly produced con - tent about politics , although several of the channels also pro - duced content about religion and various health - related con - spiracy theories . Averaged together , these 27 channels used more nega - tive tone ( e . g . bad , wrong , hate ) , more conﬂict words ( e . g . ﬁght , kill , attack ) , more power words ( e . g . own , order , al - low , power ) , more moral words ( e . g . wrong , honor , de - serve , judge ) , and more political words ( e . g . united states , govern , congress , senate ) in the titles of their videos on BitChute than the average BitChute video ( see ( Horne 2022 ) for platform - level averages ) . All four categories are more than the average content on Facebook , Twitter , and Red - dit . Similarly , together these channels used more negative Channel Created YT Created BC Styxhexenhammer666 2008 2017 Resistance Chicks Church 2013 2018 Martin Brodel 2011 2019 The Duran 2016 2018 Timcast 2010 2017 Tim Pool 2011 2018 Timcast IRL 2016 2019 MR .

Note , Dan Bongino and Vaccine Wars have been banned from YouTube since our data collection . tone and more political words in the titles of their videos on YouTube than the average BitChute video . However , on average their YouTube video titles use less conﬂict words , less power words , and less moral words than the average BitChute video . These aggregated differences are partially due to the topical focus of these channels ( channels that cover U . S . politics ) . These differences also indicate that co - active YouTube channels and BitChute channels do not nec - essarily produce the exact same content across platforms . RQ1 : Production across platforms In Table 1 , we show the 27 matched channels and the years in which they created their YouTube channel and their BitChute channel . Some - what surprisingly , the YouTube channel is not always cre - ated before the BitChute channel . Of the 27 matched chan - nels , two channels created their BitChute channel before creating their YouTube channel , and three channels created both channels at approximately the same time . However , the majority ( 22 of 27 ) created their YouTube channels prior to their BitChute channels , with the maximum distance be - tween creations of 14 years and minimum distances between creations of 1 year . In Figure 1 , we show plots of the number of videos pub - lished by each channel on each platform over time ( Octo - ber 2020 to October 2021 ) . At a high level , the patterns of production across platforms is very inconsistent across matched channels , with some channels creating much more content on YouTube than BitChute and vice versa . Some channels exhibit the production pattern we expect based on the narrative that channels are moving away from YouTube to BitChute . For example , three channels produced more YouTube videos during 2020 , but transition to producing more BitChute videos in 2021 . Yet , seven channels show the opposite behavior , producing more on BitChute early in the time frame and more on YouTube late . Some of these chan - nels seem to abandon one platform or another during the time span : channel Raw Zone Political Avenger stopped producing videos on BitChute in July 2021 , chan - nel Seb Menard stopped producing videos on BitChute in December 2020 , and channel Vaccine Wars stopped producing videos on YouTube in January 2021 ( because they were banned by YouTube ) . Others picked up one platform during the time span : channel Vicious Allen Klown World did not produce YouTube videos until the middle of 2021 ( when their YouTube channel was created ) and chan - nel Resistance Chicks Church did not produced YouTube videos until the middle of 2021 ( despite their YouTube channel existing since 2013 ) . Overall , there is not a single pattern of production across platforms in our data sample . Perhaps most importantly , this lack of pattern demonstrates that today channels on BitChute are not necessarily clones of channels on YouTube , opposite of what evidence in early studies of BitChute demonstrated ( Trujillo et al . 2020 ) . Although in a few of our sampled chan - nels , the videos are the same on YouTube and BitChute ( for example the channel Styxhexenhammer666 ) . RQ2 : Toxicity and language across platforms Next , we examine the toxicity and language use in video titles across platforms using the Perspective API and LIWC - 22 . In Ta - ble 2 , we show the number of channels that showed sig - niﬁcant differences in language and toxicity use across 22 features . In Figures 2 and 3 , we show a selection of channel - by - channel feature differences . As shown in Table 2 , the majority of content producers used signiﬁcantly more political words ( e . g . united states , govern , congress , senate ) and moral words ( e . g . wrong , honor , deserve , judge ) in their video titles on BitChute com - pared to their video titles on YouTube . Other features that were often used more in titles on BitChute , but not by the majority of content producers , included power words ( e . g . own , order , allow , power ) , casual words ( e . g . how , because , make , why ) , and conﬂict words ( e . g . ﬁght , kill , attack ) , used more on BitChute by 48 % , 40 % , and 40 % of the content pro - ducers , respectively . On the other hand , content producers often used higher levels of negative tone ( e . g . bad , wrong , too much , hate ) and prosocial language ( e . g . care , help , thank , please ) in their video titles on YouTube , used more on YouTube by 44 % and 40 % of content producers , respec - tively . Notably , while there are some differences in the language use in video titles across platforms ( particularly in the use of moral and political language ) , the majority of channels do not use signiﬁcantly different language across the platforms , despite often producing different videos across the platforms during the same time span .

We note in bold the features where the majority of channels ( > 50 % ) are signiﬁcantly higher . city of video titles does not change signiﬁcantly across the platforms . Only 1 channel used more toxicity in their video titles on BitChute than on YouTube , while 3 channels used more toxicity in their video titles on YouTube than BitChute . In both cases , the effect sizes are very small . Of course , these trends are not one - size - ﬁts - all , with some clear outliers shown in the channel - by - channel dif - ferences . For example , when examining the channel The Jordan Report , our language features showed a signiﬁ - cantly higher use of ethnicity words in their BitChute titles . When qualitatively examining videos from The Jordan Report on both platforms , we saw consistent themes of racism and antisemitism across both platforms , but con - ﬁrm that there was a shift in ethnicity word usage on BitChute . We found the opposite to be true about the channel U2Bheavenbound Warrior , which used signiﬁcantly more ethnicity words in their YouTube titles . Interestingly , when qualitatively examining the channel on both plat - forms , we found that this word usage difference was due to each platform having a different topical focus during the time - frame . Namely , U2Bheavenbound Warrior ’s YouTube channel produced videos on global ”end times” conspiracies in the US , UK , Russia , Israel , and China . While , during the same time frame on BitChute , videos were produced about the 2020 US Elections and COVID - 19 con - spiracy theories . This different topical production across the platforms may have been due to differences in what content was moderated on YouTube , as we know YouTube increased moderation around election and COVID - 19 conspiracy the - ories during that time . Conclusion In this short paper , we provide the ﬁrst exploration of co - active content creators on YouTube and BitChute . We ﬁnd evidence that co - active channels produce different content across the platforms but that content tends to not signif - icantly differ in language characteristics . In some cases where language did signiﬁcantly differ across the plat - forms , the content was about completely different topics . In other cases , these changes were due to platform production changes across time ( event coverage ) . In rare cases , video titles of the same video were being changed across the plat - forms . However , no single pattern was consistent across the 27 matched channels . With a broader sample of co - active channels , future work can better categorize the reasons and behavior across the platforms . This inconsistency points to a broader point : production on and movement to alt - tech social media platforms does not ﬁt a single narrative . While yes , it is still clear that some content producers move to alt - tech platforms due to being banned from from mainstream platforms , this narrative does not ﬁt all content producers . In this case of this study , we show that content producers may change topics completely across platforms , perhaps producing content for a different audience or to avoid moderation measures on speciﬁc con - tent . We also found that some producers move the opposite direction ( from alt - tech to mainstream ) . Future work should better explore this point . While video content may not al - ways differ , the audiences consuming the content does . The audience change across platforms is likely a factor in pro - ducers decisions to be on one platform or both platforms . Limitations This study is not without limitations and should be thought of as a preliminary exploration of co - activity . One limita - tion is that we focused on operationalizing the matching task rather than extracting the broadest possible sample of matching channels across the platforms . We used a strict channel name match and performed this matching task on a topic and time speciﬁc dataset ( channels linked to in the VoterFraud2020 dataset ) . Hence , it is likely that there are many more coexisting channels that were not examined in our analysis and those channels may produce different types of content ( in particular content not related to politics ) . How - ever , this small number of matched channels made manual analysis at the channel level possible , giving us assurances that the channels were legitimately coexisting channels . Second , given that our data only captures content pro - duction during an overlapping period across the platforms , rather than before and after a producer begin creating con - tent on one platform or another , we cannot establish causal relationships or spillover effects of being co - active . In future work , comparing these trends to a baseline set of disjoint content producers from each platform may provide more ro - bust insights . Ethics Statement While we considered removing speciﬁc channel names from our study , this removal would reduce our study’s provenance and context . Further , the content producers examined in this study post videos for public consumption , hence they should not have the expectation of anonymity .
