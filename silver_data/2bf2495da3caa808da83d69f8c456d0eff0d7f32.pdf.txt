Hubmayr 5 and Xiaoli Zhao 1 , 6 * Abstract Background : Chronic tissue injury was shown to induce progressive scarring in fibrotic diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( IPF ) , while an array of repair / regeneration and stress responses come to equilibrium to determine the outcome of injury at the organ level . In the lung , type I alveolar epithelial ( ATI ) cells constitute the epithelial barrier , while type II alveolar epithelial ( ATII ) cells play a pivotal role in regenerating the injured distal lungs . It had been demonstrated that eukaryotic cells possess repair machinery that can quickly patch the damaged plasma membrane after injury , and our previous studies discovered the membrane - mending role of Tripartite motif containing 72 ( TRIM72 ) that expresses in a limited number of tissues including the lung . Nevertheless , the role of alveolar epithelial cell ( AEC ) repair in the pathogenesis of IPF has not been examined yet . Method : In this study , we tested the specific roles of TRIM72 in the repair of ATII cells and the development of lung fibrosis . The role of membrane repair was accessed by saponin assay on isolated primary ATII cells and rat ATII cell line . The anti - fibrotic potential of TRIM72 was tested with bleomycin - treated transgenic mice . Results : We showed that TRIM72 was upregulated following various injuries and in human IPF lungs . However , TRIM72 expression in ATII cells of the IPF lungs had aberrant subcellular localization . In vitro studies showed that TRIM72 repairs membrane injury of immortalized and primary ATIIs , leading to inhibition of stress - induced p53 activation and reduction in cell apoptosis . In vivo studies demonstrated that TRIM72 protects the integrity of the alveolar epithelial layer and reduces lung fibrosis . Conclusion : Our results suggest that TRIM72 protects injured lungs and ameliorates fibrosis through promoting post - injury repair of AECs .

Respiratory Research ( 2020 ) 21 : 132 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1186 / s12931 - 020 - 01384 - 2 Introduction Lung epithelial cells are frequently exposed to injuries by environmental hazards , cigarette smoking , free radicals , biotoxin , mechanical stresses , and hyperoxia , and plasma membrane disruptions often occur [ 1 ] . Eukaryotic cells possess the capacity to quickly restore the integrity of their plasma membrane [ 2 ] , in order to minimize the need for energy - and time - consuming wounding healing and / or regeneration processes . Previ - ous studies had revealed the mechanisms of plasma membrane repair in cells . Briefly , TRIM72 was discov - ered by an immunoproteomic screening of novel triad junction - enriched proteins in skeletal muscle cells [ 3 ] . Our previous studies suggest that TRIM72 is a critical component of the “ membrane repair kit ” in these cells [ 4 , 5 ] . Under resting conditions , TRIM72 is associated with intracellular vesicles near the sarcolemma , possibly through its direct affinity to phosphatidylserine ( PS ) [ 5 , 6 ] . Upon cell wounding , exposure to the extracellular oxidizing environment causes oligomerization of TRIM72 through disulfide bonds at C242 and leucine zipper homodimerization at L176 / L183 / L190 / V197 [ 7 ] . The protein - vesicle complex traffics to plasma mem - brane wounds and forms repair patches [ 5 ] . In these capacities , TRIM72 functions as a sensor and an effector in the plasma membrane repair process . Follow - up studies show that TRIM72 - mediated membrane repair is essential for skeletal muscle to resist exercise - or toxin - induced damages , and for the heart to endure ischemic reperfusion injuries ( mainly through oxidative stress ) [ 8 – 10 ] . Furthermore , studies in our lab revealed that TRIM72 mediates membrane repair in conjunction with Caveolin 1 and rescues the failing fate of type I alveolar epithelial cells ( ATI ) after stress , which in turn deter - mines the severity of lung injuries following ventilator injury [ 11 – 13 ] . This suggests that cell injuries in differ - ent tissues caused by various injurious stimuli use simi - lar repair mechanisms . Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( IPF ) is a fatal disease of progressive lung scarring with a median post - diagnosis life expectancy of fewer than 5 years . IPF posts an urgent medical need due to its poor prognosis and limited therapeutic options [ 14 , 15 ] . Although the exact cause for IPF is unknown , the distinct feature of excessive epi - thelial cell loss and uncontrolled fibroblast activation suggests that it is a disease of epithelial injury and aberrant wound healing [ 16 , 17 ] . Alveolar epithelial cells ( AECs ) are the direct targets of lung injury , and studies show that injury to AECs eventually leads to mesenchy - mal expansion and collagen deposition through epithelial - mesenchymal communication [ 1 , 18 ] . Specific - ally , 90 % of the alveolar surface is composed of long and thin ATI cells , while damages to ATI cells compromise the blood - gas barrier and exposes the underlying basement membrane and mesenchyme [ 19 ] . In addition , type II alveolar epithelial cells ( ATII ) were thought to play a pivotal role in the regeneration of ATI cells and pathogenesis of IPF based on the progenitor cell capacity of these cells and their ability to trans - differentiate into ATI cells [ 20 , 21 ] . Indeed , IPF lungs show characteristic ATII cell hyperplasia and surfactant protein mutations were associated with susceptibility to IPF [ 22 , 23 ] . Fur - ther studies show that regeneration of injured distal alveolar epithelium is critically determined by the “ stem - ness ” of ATII cells [ 24 – 26 ] . Consequently , ATII cell endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) stress [ 27 ] , senescence [ 28 ] , or apoptosis [ 29 ] are all closely associated with the pathogenesis of IPF . Nevertheless , mechanisms and con - tribution of ATII membrane repair following injury in the development of lung fibrosis have not yet been examined . In this study , we tested the membrane reparative role of TRIM72 in ATII cells and the role of TRIM72 in injury - induced lung fibrosis using an intratracheal bleo - mycin ( bleo ) injection ( i . t . ) model . Our results suggest that injury - induced upregulation of TRIM72 represents a protective mechanism against subsequent lung fibrosis while improving membrane repair of AEC cells and inhi - biting the stress - activated p53 pathway are involved in the demonstrated effects of TRIM72 . Thus , targeting TRIM72 may be a promising therapy for IPF . Methods Reagents 9 - tert - Butyl Doxycycline ( Dox ) HCl was from Echelon Biosciences Inc . Bleo was from EMD Millipore . RNA isolation kit RNAeasy Mini was from Qiagen . All other reagents without description were from Sigma - Aldrich . Purification and in vitro administration of recombinant TRIM72 protein Recombinant human TRIM72 protein ( rhT72 ) was in - duced and purified as described before [ 13 ] . Briefly , the pMAL - c5X - hTRIM72 vector was used for the gener - ation of rhT72 with an N - terminal maltose - binding pro - tein ( MBP ) tag . It was transformed into high efficiency express competent E . coli ( C2523 , New England Biolabs ) . The recombinant protein was then produced and puri - fied with AKTA prime protein purification system ( GE Lifesciences ) . Yield and purity of recombinant protein were confirmed by SDS - PAGE and colloidal blue stain - ing ( LC6025 , Invitrogen ) . Cultured cells in stretch assay plates were treated with an equal molar concentration of rhT72 or bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) . Human lung samples As described previously [ 30 ] , aliquots of freshly frozen de - identified human lung tissues from histologically Cong et al . Respiratory Research ( 2020 ) 21 : 132 Page 2 of 20 normal para - tumor areas ( control ) or pathologically con - firmed IPF lungs were used for Western blot and immunostaining . Cell culture and lentiviral infection Lentivirus production and transduction procedures were published before [ 12 ] . Briefly , human embryonic kidney ( HEK ) - 293 T cells from ATCC ( Catalog CRL - 3216 ) were cultured in DMEM containing 10 % FBS and 1 % P / S until 80 – 90 % confluence and transfected with L309 - TRIM72 or L309 control vector , vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein , Rev . , and Rev . response element at 2 : 1 : 1 : 1 using Xfect reagent ( Clontech ) . The rat ATII like epithelial cell line , RLE - 6TN ( ATCC , catalog CRL - 2300 ) , were cultured in F - 12 K culture medium containing 10 % FBS and 1 % Pen / Strep ( P / S ) . Cells were infected with L309 - TRIM72 lentivirus or L309 control for 6 days , and then flow cytometry sorting of GFP fluorescence was performed to enrich GFP - positive cells . Animals The generation of TRIM72 knockout ( T72KO ) and TRIM72 overexpressor ( T72OE ) mice had been de - scribed [ 11 ] . T72KO mice were backcrossed to C57BL / 6 J ( B6 ) background for at least 6 generations , and wild type ( WT ) B6 mice were used for control of the T72KO mice . Inducible T72OE heterozygous mice were on 129 / B6 background , and WT littermate controls were used for these mice . Inducible T72OE mice were crossed with sftpc - eGFP mice [ 31 ] ( No . 028356 , Jackson lab ) to gen - erate inducible sftpc - eGFP / T72OE and sftpc - eGFP / WT littermate controls . To induce TRIM72 overexpression , Dox was administered to T72OE mice and WT litter - mates via intraperitoneal ( i . p . ) injection at a dose of 25 mg / kg body weight daily for consecutive 4 days before bleo i . t . injection . Dox injection continued for twice per week after bleo treatment . The efficiency of transgene induction by Dox i . p . was confirmed by Western blot ( Fig . 7c ) . Control groups for bleo and HCl treatment were i . t . injected with an equal volume of PBS . Mice were housed in a sterile ventilated AAALAC - accredited animal facility at Eastern Virginia Medical School ( EVMS ) . All mice were kept on a 12 h light / 12 h dark cycle at 23 °C . Mice had ad libitum access to food and water . Mice of mixed gender were used for experiments , and no gender - based differences in phenotypes were identified in our study . The average age of mice was 2 ~ 6 months of age , and age - matched T72KO vs . B6 and T72OE vs . WT littermates were compared . All the ex - periments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee ( IACUC ) of the Eastern Virginia Medical School . Lung cell isolation from sftpc - eGFP mice Dox was i . p . administered to mice for consecutive 2 days , and single - cell suspension from mouse lungs was made on day 3 as described previously [ 31 ] . Cells were sus - pended in PBS containing 1 % FBS and 20 U / ml DNase . Flow cytometry and sorting of eGFP + cells was per - formed using a BD FACSAria Fusion flow sorter ( Becton Dickinson , Franklin Lakes , NJ ) and analyzed using Flow Jo 10 . 1 software ( Tree Star , Ashland , OR ) . 1 × 10 5 eGFP + cells from the sftpc - eGFP / T72OE or sftpc - eGFP / WT lungs were plated on 35 mm glass - bottom dish coated with 1 : 1 volume of 8 – 12 mg / ml Matrigel ( E1270 ) and 3 . 5 mg / ml Collagen I ( Corning , 354 , 236 ) . The culture medium was 10 % FBS , 1 % P / S , 0 . 25 μ g / ml amphotericin B , supplemented with insulin / transferrin / selenium in DMEM / F12K ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . After 4 days of culture , the cells were treated with 2 μ g / ml Dox for 48 h before membrane injury assays . Saponin injury of cells Primary mouse ATII cells or RLE cells in culture were rinsed with calcium / magnesium - free PBS two times and placed on the sample stage of the Zeiss LSM 880 laser - scanning confocal microscope . Cells were then labeled with 2 . 5 μ M FM4 – 64 membrane stain dye ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) for 30 – 40 s , and PBS buffer containing 0 . 005 % saponin plus 0 . 5 mM CaCl 2 was added . Time - lapse videos of the GFP and FM4 – 6 fluorescence were taken at 2 . 5 s / image under Ex : 488 nm , Em : 507 nm , and Ex : 507 nm , Em : 723 nm , respectively . After recording , the region of interest ( ROI ) on individual cells was de - fined to quantify fluorescent intensity normalized to baseline ( Δ F / F0 ) , and the raw data was analyzed and exported with Zen Black software ( Zeiss ) . Stretching injury of cells Stretch assay of RLE cells was performed previously [ 13 ] . 3 × 10 5 RLE cells were plated on 6 - well BioFlex dishes ( 170 , 404 , FlexCell International ) with collagen type I coating . Till about 100 % density , cells in each well were washed with PBS and incubated with PBS buffer con - taining 0 . 5 mM CaCl 2 , 2 . 5 mg / ml fixable Fluorescein isothiocyanate - labeled dextran ( FITC , D1820 , Invitro - gen ) and 0 . 5 μ M rhT72 protein or BSA for 2 min at room temperature . The cells were then stretched at 16 % elongation with a duty cycle of 50 % for 10 min . After stretching , cells sat for 5 min for membrane resealing to occur . Then cells were washed with PBS and incubated with fixable viability dye eFluor450 ( 11 , 000 in PBS , 65 – 0863 , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) for 5 min at RT to label the unrepaired cells . Then the cells were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) for 15 min at room temperature in the dark . After blocking with 5 % goat serum and 0 . 3 % TritonX - 100 in PBS , immunostaining of p53 was Cong et al . Respiratory Research ( 2020 ) 21 : 132 Page 3 of 20 performed overnight at 4 °C . After wash , cells were incu - bated with 1 : 400 Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti - mouse sec - ondary antibody in blocking buffer . To show p53 nuclear localization , only 4 , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( DAPI ) and p53 were co - stained in another experiment . The cells were washed for 5 min 3 times , and images were captured on an IX73 inverted fluorescent micro - scope ( Olympus ) with DAPI ( 405 nm ) , FITC ( 488 nm ) , and a Cy3 ( 568 nm ) filters . Ten images were randomly taken under 40 × for p53 and DAPI co - staining or 20 × for p53 / FITC / eFluor co - staining . Number of eFluor - positive , FITC - positive , p53 - positive , or double - positive cells were counted , injured cells = eFluor + + FITC + cells . Bleo injury of the cell RLE cells were treated with 50 μ g / ml bleo for 24 h before harvested for Western blot . For ubiquitination assay , 10 μ M MG132 was added to the cells with or without bleo treatment 4 h before harvesting . Lung injury models WT B6 mice were first anesthetized with 100 mg / kg ketamine and 10 mg / kg xylazine cocktail and received the following procedures to create models of lung injury : Mechanical ventilation The procedures of low and high tidal volume ventilation were performed as previously reported [ 12 ] . Briefly , after anesthesia , mice were mechanically ventilated with room air and end - expiratory pressure of 3 cmH 2 O on a Flexi - Vent ventilator ( SCIREQ , Montreal , QC , Canada ) con - tinuously for 3 h . A tidal volume of 30 ml / kg body weight at a rate of 60 / min was used for injurious ventila - tion ( IV ) , and 6 ml / kg body weight at a rate of 150 / min was used for normal ventilation ( NV ) . Lung tissues were harvested after 3 h of ventilation for RNA isolation or Western blot . HCl treatment WT B6 mice received i . t . injection [ 32 ] of 50 μ l 0 . 1 N hydrochloric acid ( HCl ) to create acid - induced lung in - jury . Lung tissues were harvested 24 h after HCl injec - tion for RNA isolation or Western blot . Bleo model To induce pulmonary fibrosis , mice were administered 75 μ l sterile PBS or bleo at a dose of 1 – 2 U / kg body weight via i . t . injection . We found that i . t . injection effi - cacy can be significantly improved by increasing the aerosol injection volume from 50 to 75 μ l , to position the microsprayer needle close to the trachea carina and to titrate the velocity of injection . Evans blue dye admin - istrated this way showed broad dye distribution into all distal lung lobes ( not shown ) . Mice used for detection of TRIM72 expression in various injurious models received 2 U / kg bleo ; 2 – 3 - month - old T72KO and WT B6 control received 1 U / kg bleo , and 5 – 6 - month - old Dox - injected T72OE and WT littermate controls received 1 . 5 U / kg bleo ; at day 0 , day 3 , day 7 , day 14 or day 21 , mice were euthanized , and the whole lung was dissected out . The right mainstem bronchus was tied off with 4 – 0 silk su - ture , and the right lung was cut and snap - frozen in li - quid nitrogen . Right lung lobes were stored at − 80 °C for collagen content quantification using the hydroxy - proline assay kit ( Sigma - Aldrich , MAK008 ) , Western blot , and total RNA isolation ( RNeasy Mini Kit , QIA - GEN , 74104 ) . The left lung was inflated with 4 % PFA at 20 cmH 2 O and fixed overnight at 4 °C . The left lobes were processed at the biorepository core of EVMS and used for H & E , Masson ’ s trichrome staining , and immu - nostaining . Injury score of a lung section from bleo treated lung was determined by T1 α and was defined as follows : minimal ( 1 ) , moderate ( 2 ) , severe ( 3 ) , maximum ( 4 ) disruption of alveolar epithelial integrity . BALF was obtained on day 3 after bleo i . t . with lavages using 1 ml PBS . Cells in BALF were counted with countess II FL automated cell counter ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . Post - injury administration of rhT72 in bleo - treated mice 75 μ l 1 . 5 U / kg body weight bleo ( 50 % higher dose than that in B6 WT / T72KO experiment ) were administered to the 8 – 12 weeks old B6 WT mice on day 0 . Started on day 7 , 50 μ g rhT72 or equal molecular amount recom - binant MBP protein was delivered via intraperitoneal in - jection to mice for 5 consecutive days . Mice were closely monitored for a total of 14 days . Mortality was recorded and lung samples were harvested for histology analysis . Kaplan - Meier survival curves were created for bleo - exposed rhT72 - or recombinant MBP protein - treated mice . Hydroxyproline assay To test the level of collagen in the mouse lungs , the right lungs were used for hydroxyproline assay ( Sigma - Aldrich ) according to the manufacturer ’ s procedure . Briefly , the right lungs were homogenized in PBS and hydrolyzed in 6 N HCl at 120 °C overnight . Diluted sam - ples were incubated with 4 - ( dimethylamino ) benzalde - hyde ( DMAB ) for 90 min at 60 °C , and the oxidized hydroxyproline was determined at the absorbance of 560 nm . Western blot Mouse lung samples were lysed in radioimmunoprecipi - tation assay ( RIPA ) buffer consisting of 10 mM Tris - HCl , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 0 . 5 mM EGTA , 1 % TritonX - 100 , 0 . 1 % sodium deoxycholate , 0 . 1 % SDS , and 1 % protease inhibitor cocktail ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) Cong et al . Respiratory Research ( 2020 ) 21 : 132 Page 4 of 20 at 4 °C for 30 min . The lysates were centrifuged at 12 , 000 × RPM for 15 min at 4 °C . Protein concentrations in the supernatants were determined by the BCA protein assay kit ( Bio - Rad ) . For Western blot , 40 μ g of total pro - tein were resolved by 10 % SDS - PAGE followed by trans - ferring to a 0 . 2 μ m polyvinylidene fluoride ( PVDF ) membrane . The membrane was blocked with 5 % non - fat milk in PBST ( 0 . 1 % Tween - 20 ) at room temperature for 30 min and then incubated with 5 % milk or 5 % BSA di - luted primary antibody at 4 °C overnight . The membrane was then incubated with a 1 : 1000 diluted secondary antibody and detected with Pierce ™ ECL Western Blot Substrate ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . The following pri - mary antibodies were used : rabbit anti - TRIM72 [ 11 ] ( 1014 , 1 : 500 , custom - made ) , rabbit anti - Phospho - p53 [ 33 ] ( 9284 , 1 : 1000 , Cell Signaling ) , mouse anti - p53 [ 33 ] ( 2524 , 1 : 500 dilution , Cell Signaling ) , mouse anti - ubiquitin [ 34 ] ( 3936 , 1 : 500 , Cell signaling ) , and anti - mouse anti - β - actin [ 35 ] ( 1 : 5000 , Sigma - Aldrich ) . Reverse transcription - quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( RT - qPCR ) Total RNA from mouse right lung was extracted using the Qiagen RNAeasy Mini kit , following the manufac - turer ’ s introduction . Concentrations and purity of RNA samples were determined using a Nanodrop LITE spec - trophotometer ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . Reverse tran - scription was performed with the ImProm - II ™ Reverse Transcription System ( Promega ) . Quantitative PCR was performed using 1 μ l cDNA in a total volume of 10 μ l containing 5 μ l of 2 × SyberGreen PCR Master Mix ( Life Technologies Corp . ) and 0 . 2 μ M gene - specific forward and reverse primers on a CFX96 Touch Real - Time PCR Detection System ( Bio - Rad Laboratories ) . PCR condition was 36 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C and 1 min at 60 °C . Primer sequences were listed in Table 1 . The specificity of all primers was verified by analysis of melting curves and agarose gel electrophoresis . The amplification efficiency of any single pair of primers was determined by analyz - ing the standard curve of serially diluted cDNA samples . The relative abundance of mRNA to Glyceraldehyde 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( Gadph ) mRNA level in the same sample was calculated using the ΔΔ Ct method [ 36 ] . Immunostaining Paraffin - embedded lung sections of 5 μ m thin were depar - affinized , hydrated , and subjected to antigen retrieval . The following primary antibodies were used for immunostain - ing : mouse anti - α - smooth muscle actin ( α - SMA , 1A4 , Abcam ) , rabbit anti - surfactant protein C ( SPC , sc - 13 , 979 , 1 : 50 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Inc ) , rat anti - Pdpn ( T1 α , NBP2 – 03955 , 1 : 200 , Novus Biologicals ) , mouse anti - p53 ( 2524 , 1 : 500 , Cell Signaling Technology ) , rabbit anti - TRIM72 ( ARP42971 , 1 : 100 , Aviva Systems Biology ) , cleaved caspase - 3 ( Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated , Asp 175 , 1 : 50 , Cell Signaling Technology ) and mouse anti - human ATII cell membrane antigen ( HT2 – 280 , 1 : 100 , Terrace Bio - tech ) . Fluorochrome - labeled species - specific secondary antibodies were used for immunofluorescence staining , and DAPI was used for nuclear staining . Stained sections were imaged using an Olympus IX73 fluorescent microscope .

Results TRIM72 expression in the lung is induced by various injurious stimuli Endogenous reparative mechanisms first have to be able to sense and respond to injurious insults [ 38 – 40 ] . To examine TRIM72 expression following lung injury , we collected lung tissues subjected to 3 h of ventilation at 30 ml / kg tidal volume ( IV ) , those received i . t . injection of 0 . 1 N HCl or 2 U / kg bleo [ 1 ] . Western results showed that all 3 injurious manipulations upregulated TRIM72 protein expression ( Fig . 1a ) . Expression of Trim72 mRNA also increased in the IV , HCl , or bleo - treated lung , compared to that in controls ( Fig . 1b , 3e ) , suggest - ing that injury upregulates TRIM72 expression at the transcriptional level . We also measured TRIM72 expres - sion in control and IPF human lung specimens . As shown in Fig . 2a , an increase in TRIM72 protein expres - sion was seen in IPF as compared to the control lungs . Furthermore , TRIM72 expression in human ATII cells was detected by co - immunostaining of TRIM72 and HT2 – 280 , a human ATII - specific membrane protein . Our results showed that TRIM72 expression was most abundant in HT2 – 280 - positive ATII cells in human lungs and increased in IPF lungs ( Fig . 2b ) . Enlarged im - ages in Fig . 2b showed that the wide subcellular localization of TRIM72 in normal human ATII cells , i . e . , plasma membrane , cytosol , and nucleus ( stars ) , was changed into an aberrant nucleus - concentrated localization in the IPF ATII cells ( Fig . 2b , star ) . Fig . 1 TRIM72 expression in the lung is induced by various injurious stimuli . a Western blot of TRIM72 protein in wildtype ( WT ) lungs received normal tidal volume ( NV ) or injurious ventilation ( IV ) for 3 h , intra - tracheal ( i . t . ) injection of PBS , 0 . 1 N hydrochloride acid ( HCl ) or 2 U / kg bleomycin ( bleo ) . Tissues were harvested from mice 24 h after HCl i . t . or 14 d after bleo i . t . .

We found that 1 ) microarray analysis detected increased TRIM72 expression in airway epithelial cells from pa - tients with severe asthma [ 42 ] ; 2 ) ATII cells from surfac - tant protein C ( Sftpc ) - deficient mice had increased TRIM72 expression [ 43 ] ; 3 ) H5N1 viral infection in - creased TRIM72 expression in human airway epithelial Calu - 3 cells ( NCBI GEO dataset GSE43204 ) ; 4 ) expres - sion of Trim72 mRNA was upregulated in ATI and ATII cells from IPF lung through single - cell RNA - seq analysis ( https : / / www . biorxiv . org / content / 10 . 1101 / 759902v1 ) . It is known that severe asthma and viral infection injure lung epithelial cells via excessive immune responses [ 1 ] , while Sftpc - deficiency leads to endoplasmic reticulum stress in ATII cells [ 22 ] and cell susceptibility to mechanical forces due to increased surface tension . These data are summarized in Table 2 . Thus , along with the pattern of TRIM72 upregulation in response to vari - ous injurious stimuli to the lung epithelium , the bio - informatics data suggests that TRIM72 is an injury responsive protein for a broad range of acute and chronic injuries to the lung . Tapering of bleo - induced TRIM72 upregulation correlates with an increase in lung collagen To examine the time course of injury - induced TRIM72 upregulation , we harvested lung tissues exposed to 1 . 5 U / kg bleo at various time points , i . e . , day 0 , 7 , 14 and 21 after i . t . injection . Histology showed that bleo - treated WT lungs had a steady progression of alveolar structure disruption and expansion of scarred areas ( Fig . 3a ) .

Respiratory Research ( 2020 ) 21 : 132 Page 8 of 20 identity of fibrotic areas in bleo - treated lungs was con - firmed by the detection of mesenchymal marker α - SMA amid the scarred lung areas ( Fig . 3b ) and a significant in - crease in the hydroxyproline content of the lung from day 14 to day 21 following bleo i . t . ( Fig . 3c ) , suggesting the successful establishment of the bleo - induced lung in - jury and fibrosis model . Finally , Western blot showed that average TRIM72 protein and mRNA upregulation induced by bleo injury peaked at day 7 and gradually ta - pered off afterward ( Fig . 3d , e ) . These data support that a single incidence of injury induces transitory TRIM72 upregulation , possibly as a compensatory protective mechanism , raising the intriguing possibility that IPF lungs had been exposed to repeated injuries and that TRIM72 upregulation in IPF lungs may have lost its pro - tective capacity . TRIM72 promotes membrane repair of ATII cells To examine if TRIM72 acts in plasma membrane repair in ATII cells , we used ATII - like RLE with or without lentivirus - mediated TRIM72 expression ( L309 - T72 ) . As shown in Fig . 4a , lentivirus infection has high efficiency , as indicated by the expression of GFP on the L309 vec - tor . We showed that 0 . 005 % saponin treatment releases intracellular GFP from RLE cells through porated plasma membrane ( Fig . 4b ) . Furthermore , FM4 – 64 dye entry following saponin treatment was quantified in control and L309 - T72 RLE cells . Our results showed that TRIM72 expression significantly reduced the degree and kinetics of FM4 – 64 entry into RLE cells ( Fig . 4c - d ) , sug - gesting improved membrane repair . Next , we crossed the inducible T72OE [ 11 , 44 ] male with the Sftpc - eGFP knock - in female [ 31 ] to establish the sftpc - EGFP / WT and Sftpc - EGFP / T72 OE mice . Flow cytometry sorting of eGFP positive cells was used to isolate primary ATII cells from these mice ( Fig . 4e - f ) . Cells were then cul - tured on matrigel : collagen - coated dish for 5 days before membrane repair assays . Our results showed that T72OE significantly boosts the membrane repair cap - acity of primary ATII cells compared to WT cells , as in - dicated by FM4 – 64 entry ( Fig . 4g - h ) . These data support that TRIM72 is an effective membrane repair machinery in ATII cells . TRIM72 salvages p53 activation in ATII cells The p53 signaling pathway is a master sensor and ef - fector of multiple stress stimuli [ 40 ] . It responds to cel - lular stresses and is turned on to modulate cell fates and fibrotic pathways [ 45 – 48 ] . A previous study showed that stretch injury induces p53 activation and apoptosis in vascular smooth muscle cells [ 49 ] . Here we confirmed the stretch - induced increase in p53 protein expression and nuclear translocation in RLE cells , while rhT72 sig - nificantly reduced p53 activation in stretched cells ( Fig . 5a , b ) . Moreover , to assess p53 activation among membrane injured - cells , we applied FITC - dextran dye during stretching to label membrane injured and repaired cells and viability dye eFluor 450 after stretch - ing to label non - repaired cells [ 13 ] , and thus summarization of the two cell population represents total membrane injured - cells . Immunostaining of p53 was performed in fixed cells after stretching . Our data showed that p53 could be detected in cells that are nega - tive for FITC or eFluor staining , suggesting that stretch - ing stress can activate p53 in a small population of sensitive cells ( < 1 % of total cells ) despite the lack of membrane injury ( Fig . 5a - b ) . On the contrary , 20 % of membrane injured cells ( FITC + plus eFluor + cells ) were positive for p53 ( Fig . 5a - b ) , suggesting the presence of additional p53 activator during membrane injury . Ex - ogenous rhT72 significantly inhibited the percentage of p53 positive cells among membrane injured cells ( Fig . 5a - b ) , suggesting that TRIM72 modulates p53 activation after its activation by various stresses . To probe the mechanisms of TRIM72 - mediated p53 inhibition , we ex - amined Ser15 phosphorylation of p53 ( p - p53 ) that is shown to retain p53 in the nucleus [ 50 ] and proteasome - mediated protein degradation that is the main regulatory pathway for p53 abundance . Our results showed that bleo treatment induced a remarkable in - crease in p - p53 and total p53 in control RLE cells while T72OE inhibited both of them ( Fig . 5c - f ) . In addition , T72OE is shown to increase the overall ubiquitination activity in RLE cells ( Fig . 5d , red stars ) and that T72OE inhibition on bleo - induced p53 upregulation was largely neutralized by MG132 treatment to block proteasome degradation of ubiquitin - conjugated proteins ( Fig . 5c - f ) . These results suggest that T72OE inhibits bleo induced - p53 activation via reducing its phosphorylation and pro - moting its proteasomal degradation . TRIM72 inhibits bleo - induced ATII cell apoptosis Increased ATII cell death is a common feature of the IPF lungs and bleo - injured mouse lungs [ 29 , 51 ] . Using WT and T72OE lungs received PBS or bleo i . t . , we con - firmed the significant increase in total apoptotic cells in bleo - treated WT lungs as compared to PBS - treated lungs by TUNEL assay and immunostaining of cleaved caspase - 3 ( Fig . 6a - b ) , among which over 40 % apoptotic cells were also SPC positive ( Fig . 6c ) , suggesting that ATII cell is a major target of bleo - induced cell apoptosis . In addition , over 30 % of SPC - positive ATII cells were apoptotic ( Fig . 6c ) , indicating the susceptibility of ATII cells to apoptosis . Compared to the WT lungs , T72OE lungs had a significant reduction in overall cell apoptosis and ATII apoptosis following bleo ( Fig . 6b - c ) . This is consistent with our finding of TRIM72 inhibition on stress - induced p53 activation , which was shown to play Cong et al .

TRIM72 maintains alveolar epithelial integrity in injured lungs To examine if TRIM72 plays a significant protective ef - fect on alveolar epithelial integrity due to its reparative role for both ATI and ATII cells , we performed T1 α im - munostaining in lungs . As shown in Fig . 7a , bleo - injury caused patchy disruption of T1 α - positive alveolar epithelial layer in WT lungs , while in T72KO lungs , such disruption was wide - spread , and there were signs of epi - thelial thickening ( Fig . 7a , arrows ) . On the contrary , the lungs of the T72OE mice only showed minor structural disruptions . A similar trend of histological injuries was seen in WT , T72KO , and T72OE lungs by H & E staining ( Fig . 7b ) . Quantification of histological injury scores was done based on the extent of disrupted alveolar epithelial integrity based on T1 α staining ( Fig . 7d ) .

Our re - sults showed that bleo - injured T72KO lungs had signifi - cantly lower levels of Cdh1 , Sftpc , Hopx , and Aqp5 mRNA as compared to the WT lungs , which were sig - nificantly ameliorated in the T72OE lungs ( Fig . 7e ) . Fur - thermore , to assess barrier integrity and infiltration of inflammatory cells , we detected BAL fluid ( BALF ) pro - tein and total cells in BALF in bleo - treated mice . Our results showed that T72KO lungs had increased lung permeability and cell infiltration in the lung , which was ameliorated in the T72OE lung , as compared with B6 WT controls or Dox - injected WT littermate , respect - ively ( Fig . 8 ) . These results suggest that TRIM72 reduces injury - induced epithelial disruption [ 24 , 25 ] . TRIM72 protects the lung from bleo - induced lung fibrosis To further examine if TRIM72 - mediated epithelial pro - tection leads to reduced lung fibrosis , we assessed Fig . 7 TRIM72 maintains alveolar epithelial integrity in stressed lungs . a Immunostaining of T1 α to indicate alveolar epithelial integrity in PBS - and bleo - treated B6 WT , T72KO , and T72OE ( Dox injected ) lungs .

Respiratory Research ( 2020 ) 21 : 132 Page 13 of 20 fibrotic markers in bleo - treated lungs at day 14 after bleo exposure . As compared to PBS - treated lungs , bleo - treated WT lungs had increased trichrome staining intensity , elevated hydroxyproline content as well as in - creased mRNA levels of extracellular matrix proteins Collagen I α 1 ( Col1 α 1 ) and Fibronectin ( Fn ) as well as mesenchymal marker α - SMA ( Fig . 9 ) . Trichrome stain - ing showed that bleo - induced fibrosis was significantly worsened in T72KO lungs but ameliorated in the T72OE lungs compared to B6 WT controls or Dox - injected WT littermates ( Fig . 9a ) . In addition , the T72KO lungs had increased hydroxyproline level , while the T72OE lungs had a significant reduction in hydroxy - proline as compared to their appropriate WT controls ( Fig . 9b ) . This is accompanied by an increase in the mRNA expressions of Col1 α 1 , Fn , and α - SMA in the bleo - treated T72KO lungs and a decrease in expression of those 3 genes in the bleo - treated T72OE lungs com - pared to their controls ( Fig . 9b ) . These data suggest that TRIM72 is indispensable for the protection against bleo - induced lung injury and fibrosis and that TRIM72 aug - mentation improves lung fibrosis . To address whether a repair therapy administrated after bleo exposure can mitigate lung fibrosis , we per - formed post - injury administration of rhT72 . As shown in Fig . 10 , intraperitoneal application of rhT72 post - bleo treatment at day 7 – 11 significantly attenuated mortality ( Fig . 10a ) and reduced Trichrome staining following bleo injury ( Fig . 10b ) . The Mantel - Cox Log Rank test showed that the survival rate of the bleo / rhT72 - treated mice was significantly higher than that of the bleo / CTRL - treated mice ( p = 0 . 0469 ) ( Fig . 10a ) . These data support the therapeutic value of rhT72 once injury - induced fibrosis has been established as seen in IPF patients . Discussion In this study , we characterized the expression of a previ - ously identified membrane repair protein , e . g . , TRIM72 , following various injurious stimuli to the lung and exam - ined the role of TRIM72 in membrane repair of ATII cells . Furthermore , we assessed the consequences of gen - etic TRIM72 modulation in a mouse model of bleo - induced lung injury and fibrosis . Our data revealed an anti - injury and anti - fibrosis role of TRIM72 , likely through promoting repair and survival of ATII cells and curtailing the stress - activated p53 pathway . IPF is featured with excessive loss of alveolar epithelial cells and aberrant mesenchymal cell activation [ 51 , 53 ] , while direct and indirect evidence suggests that the pos - sible causes of fibrosis are repeated injuries to the lung Fig . 8 BAL fluid ( BALF ) cell profiles and BALF protein of bleo - injured lungs . a total BALF cells in WT vs .

Respiratory Research ( 2020 ) 21 : 132 Page 14 of 20 [ 16 ] . Specifically , 1 ) the IPF pathology of epithelial cell loss , regeneration , and fibroblast proliferation resembles that of skin wound healing following epidermal injury [ 54 ] ; 2 ) risk factors for IPF such as virus infection , gas - troesophageal reflux , radiation , cigarette smoke , and en - vironmental exposures can all cause cell injury via a variety of mechanisms [ 1 ] ; 3 ) genome - wide association studies identified susceptible variants for IPF [ 23 , 55 , 56 ] such as surfactant protein genes , mucin , telomerase and cytoskeleton genes , are also susceptible factors for in - creased cell injury and / or compromised cell repair [ 1 ] ; 4 ) de novo injury to the lung such as mechanical ventila - tion has been shown to induce lung fibrosis in human patients [ 57 ] ; 5 ) injurious maneuvers such as i . t . injec - tion of bleo and HCl , or mechanical ventilation , recap - itulate IPF pathology in animal models [ 58 , 59 ] . To this end , tissue injury stimulates both post - injury stress and reparative responses , the equilibrium of which collectively determine the overall outcome of injury at organ level [ 39 ] . Among these reparative responses , our studies showed that membrane repair of wounded cells is a funda - mental process to determine the split fate of acutely in - jured alveolar epithelial cells [ 1 ] . However , the role of alveolar epithelial cell membrane repair in the pathogen - esis of IPF has not been investigated . Harmful stress responses and reparative responses often manifest parallelly at the injured tissues through complex crosstalk , resembling the concurrent upregula - tion of pro - inflammatory and immuno - modulatory com - ponents of the immune system at pathogen - infected tissues . We reason that important reparative processes must be responsive to injurious stimuli . Our data in this study show that TRIM72 expression in the lung is up - regulated in response to injurious ventilation , HCl instil - lation , and bleo exposure ( Fig . 1 ) . In addition , TRIM72 upregulation by injury is transient , and tapering of the Fig . 9 TRIM72 protects bleomycin ( bleo ) - induced lung injury and fibrosis . a Masson ’ s trichrome staining in bleo - treated B6 WT , T72KO , Dox - injected WT , and T72OE lungs .

Respiratory Research ( 2020 ) 21 : 132 Page 15 of 20 TRIM72 level correlates with the rising of hydroxypro - line level in the lung ( Fig . 3 ) . These findings suggest that lung tissues share similar compensatory cell protective mechanisms against various injurious insults , while post - injury responses are orchestrated in a temporally con - trolled fashion . Interestingly , the average TRIM72 level is elevated in IPF lungs ( Fig . 2 ) , suggesting that IPF lungs may be exposed to injurious insults . Nevertheless , differ - ent from the broad subcellular localization of TRIM72 in normal lung ATII cells where it is mostly concen - trated in the lung , TRIM72 in ATII cells from IPF lung concentrates in the nucleus , raising the question whether the change in TRIM72 subcellular localization is a consequence of repeated lung injury and casting doubts on whether the upregulated TRIM72 in IPF lungs retains its physiological protective function . Injury - sensitive reparative or stress responses need to be carefully dissected to differentiate these that are bene - ficial from those that are detrimental to eventual tissue fate . Through in vivo characterization of transgenic mouse lines of T72KO and T72OE , we found that abla - tion of TRIM72 reduces overall alveolar epithelial Fig . 10 Post - injury delivery of recombinant human TRIM72 protein ( rhT72 ) reduces mortality and prevents lung fibrosis in bleomycin ( bleo ) - exposed mice . a intraperitoneal injection of rhT72 at post - injury days 7 – 11 ameliorates the mortality in bleo - treated mice .

Respiratory Research ( 2020 ) 21 : 132 Page 16 of 20 integrity , histological destruction , and barrier function of the lung following bleo injury while aggravates injury - induced inflammatory cell infiltration and lung fibrosis as compared to WT controls ( Figs . 7 , 8 and 9 ) . We de - tected significant reductions in an overall epithelial marker Cdh1 , ATI cell markers homeobox only protein x Hopx [ 60 ] and Aqp5 [ 61 ] , and ATII cell marker sftpc ( Fig . 7e ) , suggesting that T72KO compromises repair re - sponses of both ATI and ATII cells . This is consistent with our previous finding of the protective role of TRIM72 in ATI cells [ 11 ] and data in this study showing a membrane repair function on TRIM72 in ATII cells . On the other hand , TRIM72 overexpression protects the lung from bleo - induced lung injury and fibrosis ( Fig . 7 , 8 and 9 ) . Importantly , post - injury administration of rhT72 reduces the mortality of bleo - exposed mice and weakens the Trichrome staining intensity of the lung ( Fig . 10 ) . Collectively , these data suggest that TRIM72 is a repara - tive molecule amid the post - injury stress responses in the lung . In addition , TRIM72 augmentation on top of endogenous upregulation in response to injurious stim - uli provides further protection for lung injuries , suggest - ing that a membrane repair therapy may be beneficial for the progressive tissue destruction in IPF , which is thought to be a result of repeated micro - injuries [ 16 ] . Our previous studies suggest that TRIM72 plays an es - sential role in the repair of alveolar epithelial cells in particular ATI cells [ 1 , 11 , 12 ] , which determine the ex - tent of tissue pathology in a murine model of ventilator - induced lung injury . Exogenous rhT72 was shown to both improve cell repair and increase cell resilience to stretching wounding [ 11 – 13 ] . We found that an inter - action between TRIM72 and Caveolin 1 ( Cav1 ) , a pro - tein component of plasma membrane caveolae , and another membrane repair molecule [ 62 – 64 ] , is particu - larly important for the membrane repair role of TRIM72 in ATI cells [ 12 ] . In this study , we confirmed that TRIM72 also expresses in human ATII cells ( Fig . 2b ) , where Cav1 expression is thought to be missing [ 12 , 65 ] , which may be accountable for the largely plasma mem - brane localization of TRIM72 in ATI cells [ 11 , 12 ] but the broader subcellular localization of TRIM72 in ATII cells . Nevertheless , using membrane repair assays [ 66 ] , we showed that TRIM72 could improve the membrane repair capacity of immortalized and primary ATII cells ( Fig . 4 ) . Considering the close association of alveolar epi - thelial cell dysfunction with the pathogenesis of IPF [ 17 , 18 , 22 , 67 ] and the progenitor role of ATII cells in re - generating the distal alveoli in adult lungs [ 24 ] , the po - tential of TRIM72 for protecting against fibrosis in injured lungs is substantial due to the beneficial effect on both ATI and ATII cells . In this study , our data showed that T72OE reduces bleo - induced apoptosis of ATII cells ( Fig . 6 ) and thus preserves the number of lung progenitor cells . As we show p53 inhibition upon T72OE or rhT72 treatment ( Fig . 5 ) , this is consistent with the reported role of the stress - activated p53 path - way in promoting apoptosis of distressed alveolar epithe - lial cells [ 47 , 48 ] . In addition , as a previous report showing an inhibitory role of p53 activation on the self - renewal and proliferative capacities of club progenitor cells in the lung [ 68 ] , it is possible that TRIM72 also in - hibits the self - renewal capacity of ATII cells through inhibiting the p53 pathway , which may be addressed by future colony formation and lineage tracing studies . Consequentially , as the epithelial cell - specific increase in p53 was shown to aggravate both liver and pulmonary fi - brosis [ 46 – 48 ] , it is plausible that TRIM72 inhibition of p53 in alveolar epithelial cells reduces injury - induced lung fibrosis . Studies reveal a complex crosstalk network of post - injury responses in the lung [ 69 ] . Epithelial cell injury was shown to trigger fibrogenesis via various mecha - nisms [ 70 , 71 ] , while epithelial sloughing following chronic injury destroys the basement membrane and al - ters extracellular matrix to prefer mesenchymal cell growth over the regenerating epithelium [ 72 ] . The p53 signaling pathway is a vital stress sensor in many cell types , which plays key roles in directing cell fate after in - jury or stress [ 40 , 45 , 73 ] . Our data show that stretching can trigger p53 activation in a small percentage of RLE cells despite the presence of membrane injury ( p53 + FITC - eFluor - cells ) , while the presence of membrane in - jury causes p53 activation in about 20 % of injured cells ( Fig . 5a - b ) . Meanwhile , exogenous rhT72 significantly inhibited p53 activation in stretch - injured cells ( Fig . 5 ) . Overall , these findings suggest that stress is a direct acti - vator of the p53 pathway , while TRIM72 act as a p53 modulator after its activation . Given the central role of p53 in directing cell fate and modulating fibrogenesis [ 74 – 76 ] , we reason that TRIM72 reduces injury induced fibrosis both by improving membrane repair / cell vitality and inhibiting the stress pathway inhibition in alveolar epithelial cells . Furthermore , it is known that stress - induced post - translational modifications of p53 such as acetylation and phosphorylation of p53 disrupt the inter - action between p53 and its E3 ubiquitin ligase Mdm2 and thus rescues the degradation of p53 protein [ 45 ] . In addition , p53 phosphorylation at Ser 15 was shown to facilitate the nuclear retention of p53 [ 50 , 77 ] , in addition to its interference of the p53 / Mdm2 interaction . Our results showed that TRIM72 enhances the overall ubiquitination activity of RLE cells that is linked to bleo - induced p53 upregulation as well as Ser 15 phosphoryl - ation of p53 , suggesting that these post - translational modifications are the target mechanisms of TRIM72 modulation of p53 , collectively leading to suppressed transcription of p53 target genes . Nevertheless , the Cong et al . Respiratory Research ( 2020 ) 21 : 132 Page 17 of 20 mechanisms accounting for the enhanced alveolar epi - thelial cell p53 activation in bleo models and IPF [ 47 , 48 ] are unclear where TRIM72 levels are increased . Our speculation is that since p53 is such a versatile sensor for multiple types of stresses , its final level of activation will be determined by the counterbalance of stress and p53 modulators such as TRIM72 . Another limitation of the study is inherent to the use of the bleo model for assessing lung injury and fibrosis , which is acute and reversible in nature as described in previous reports [ 16 ] . To improve the consistency of lung injury and fibrosis in this model , we conducted intratracheal injection of bleo aerosol into the distal lungs . In addition , we assessed main endpoints at day 14 after bleo injection to focus on the injury / fibrogenesis phase of this model , which is appropriate given that the proposed anti - fibrosis role of TRIM72 is based on its anti - injury property . Conclusion In summary , our data revealed that TRIM72 repairs membrane injury of alveolar epithelial cells and inhibits post - injury activation of the p53 pathway . In vivo data revealed a cell / tissue - protective and anti - fibrosis effect of TRIM72 in injury - induced lung fibrosis model . Thus , targeting the membrane repair of alveolar epithelial cells and post - injury responses through TRIM72 represents a new direction for the development of IPF therapies .
