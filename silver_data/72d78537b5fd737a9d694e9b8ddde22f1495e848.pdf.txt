DNA polyhedra consist of an internal void bounded by a well - defined three - dimensional structured surface . The void can house cargo and the surface can be functionalized with stoichiometric and spatial precision . Here , we show that monofunctionalized QDs can be achieved by encapsulating QDs inside DNA icosahedra and functionalizing the DNA shell with an endocytic ligand . We deployed the DNA - encapsulated QDs for real time imaging of three different endocytic ligands - folic acid , galectin - 3 ( Gal3 ) and the Shiga toxin B - subunit ( STxB ) .

E u r op e P M C F und e r s A u t ho r M a nu s c r i p t s E u r op e P M C F und e r s A u t ho r M a nu s c r i p t s loaded DNA icosahedra allows us to monitor compartmental dynamics along endocytic pathways . These DNA - encapsulated QDs that bear a unique stoichiometry of endocytic ligands represent a new class of molecular probes for quantitative imaging of endocytic receptor dynamics . The ubiquitous deployment of quantum dots ( QDs ) in biology has been constrained due to lack of methodologies to permanently and homogenously monofunctionalize them1 . Traditional approaches to achieve this involve coupling QDs and ligands in fixed ratios in solution ( Supplementary table 1 ) 2 – 7 . This has met with limited success due to stochastic control over ligand stoichiometry leading to sample heterogeneity . Structural DNA nanotechnology has yielded diverse , well - defined , nanoscale polyhedra8 , 9 These polyhedra enclose an internal void that can house nanoscale cargo and possess a well - defined surface for molecular display with both stoichiometric and spatial precision8 , 10 – 17 . DNA icosahedra can encapsulate cargo without compromising cargo functionality and can be targeted to specific endocytic pathways8 , 12 . Here , we combine the photostability of QDs , with the molecular programmability of the DNA polyhedra by encapsulating QDs inside DNA icosahedra displaying a solitary bio - molecular tag . This is a new class of precisely functionalized particles of homogenous stoichiometry for long duration live imaging . We first pinpoint specific residues on the icosahedron for optimal surface display of biological tags . We then encapsulate QDs in the icosahedron and monofunctionalize the scaffold with folic acid ( FA ) , galectin - 3 ( Gal3 ) , or Shiga toxin B - subunit ( STxB ) . The stability of QDs by previous approaches is limited in that ligands on the QD surface are labile and can leach off leading to loss of the tag or QD aggregation18 , 19 . In our approach , this problem is overcome since the issue of QD surface chemistry is completely transferred to the robust , controllable chemistry of DNA . Monofunctionalization is achieved by conjugating the bio - tag to an amine group displayed on the DNA shell without engaging the QD . This effectively results in stably monofunctionalized QDs . Using DNA - encapsulated , QDs monofunctionalized with Gal3 or STxB as endocytic ligands , we track plasma membrane binding , bending , intracellular uptake and long duration dynamics of endocytic carriers on the Gal3 / STxB pathways20 . Encapsulation of QDs within DNA icosahedra CdSe / CdS / ZnS - based quantum dots of 5 nm diameter ( QD5 ) were synthesized as described ( Supplementary Fig . S1 ) 21 . DNA icosahedra , I , were assembled from three types of five - way junctions ( 5WJs ) , V , U and L8 . To encapsulate QDs within DNA icosahedra , two half - icosahedra VU 5 and VL 5 were incubated in the presence of excess of QD5 ( Fig . 1a and methods ) . QD - loaded DNA icosahedra were purified by gel electrophoresis and size - exclusion chromatography , ( SEC - HPLC ; Fig . 1b - c ) . A size fraction corresponding to the DNA icosahedra showed fluorescence corresponding to QD5 , indicating the formation of an I - QD5 complex ( I QD ) ( Supplementary Fig . S2 , 6 ) . Dynamic light scattering ( DLS ) studies revealed that free QD5 showed an R H 4 . 5±1 . 8 nm , while I showed an R H of 9 . 5±0 . 1 nm ( Fig . 1d , Supplementary Fig . S3 ) . Purified I QD showed an R H of 10 . 6±0 . 4 nm ( Fig . 1d ) . This implies that QD5 in I QD associates with the DNA icosahedron such that it does not Bhatia et al . Page 2 Nat Nanotechnol .

E u r op e P M C F und e r s A u t ho r M a nu s c r i p t s E u r op e P M C F und e r s A u t ho r M a nu s c r i p t s significantly alter the icosahedron dimensions . For an electron dense particle such as QD5 this is possible only if QD5 is encapsulated within the DNA icosahedron . Since the DNA icosahedron has a pore size of ~ 2 . 5 nm8 , we used a differential quenching assay to test whether the QDs were encapsulated6 . Free QD5 and I QD were subjected to quenchers of sizes ranging from 0 . 5 - 5 nm . The fluorescence intensities of 5 nM free QD5 and I QD were measured in the presence of fixed amounts of each quencher . When treated with 1 / K SV concentrations12 of each quencher , quenchers of all sizes quenched QD5 fluorescence intensity by 50 % ( Fig . 1e , Supplementary Fig . S4 ) . However , for I QD , only quenchers below ~ 2 . 2 nm diameter quenched its fluorescence by 50 % . Quenchers ≥ 3 nm could not quench I QD5 fluorescence at all , while quenchers between 2 . 2 - 3 nm partially quenched the fluorescence ( Fig . 1e ) . This confirms that QD5 in I QD is physically encapsulated as cargo within the DNA icosahedron . This was reaffirmed by experiments with single QDs or single I QD performed on a confocal microscope22 ( Fig . 1f , Supplementary Fig . S5 & S6 ) . QDs with sizes from 5 to 11 nm , with different surface chemistries , could be encapsulated in DNA icosahedra indicating the generalizability of this method . The capacity of DNA icosahedra to encapsulate nanoparticles was demonstrated by transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) where QDs were substituted with 10 nm gold nanoparticles ( GNP10 ) ( Fig . 1g , Supplementary Fig . S7 ) . The sizes of the DNA shell were between 15 - 25 nm , consistent with previous TEM measurements of DNA icosahedra8 . Endocytic uptake maps nucleotide positions on the DNA Icosahedron To target QD - loaded DNA cages along specific endocytic pathways , we first identified those nucleotide positions on the DNA scaffold where a conjugated molecular tag faces the external milieu . We developed an atomistic model of the DNA icosahedron conjugated to folic acid ( FA ) using xLeAP module in AMBER and studied its in silico stability using molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulations ( see methods ) 23 – 26 . After 50 ns of simulation , the structure displayed moderate deviations along the edges and minor structural changes at the 5WJs . However , it retained its icosahedral geometry indicating the overall stability of the architecture in silico ( Fig . 2a - b ) . We then conjugated a small endocytic ligand , folic acid ( FA ) to different nucleotide positions along a given edge of the DNA icosahedron and quantitated FA accessibility by endocytic uptake in cells expressing the folate receptor27 . Seven different folate - conjugated icosahedra ( I FA ) were realized , each with a single folate tag at residues 7 , 9 , 11 , 13 , 15 , 17 , and 19 away from the vertex V , collectively spanning a full helical turn ( Supplementary Fig . S8a , b ) . An Alexa 647 fluorophore was also incorporated on I FA to give I FA / A647 in order to visualize the icosahedral shell . IA2 . 2 cells stably expressing the human transferrin and folate receptors , were pulsed with 100 nM of each of the seven distinct I FA / A647 samples along with 100 nM fluorescent transferrin ( Tf A568 ) to normalize for endocytic uptake . I FA / A647 samples with FA tags located at positions 11 and 13 showed maximal endocytic uptake that decreased sharply as the position of the tag was moved along either direction ( Fig . 2c ) . This is consistent with the atomistic model where , at positions 11 and 13 the FA tag is maximally Bhatia et al . Page 3 Nat Nanotechnol . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2017 February 22 . E u r op e P M C F und e r s A u t ho r M a nu s c r i p t s E u r op e P M C F und e r s A u t ho r M a nu s c r i p t s exposed , reaffirming its enhanced accessibility to the folate receptor ( Supplementary Fig . S18 ) . We then tested whether I FA / A647 was endocytosed specifically by the folate receptor pathway ( Fig . 2d - e ) . I FA / A647 with FA at position 11 , hereafter designated as I FA / A647 , showed efficient uptake and colocalization with endocytic markers Tf ( Fig . 2d , upper panels ) and pteroyl lysine bodipy - TMR ( PLB ) , a fluorescent analog of folic acid ( Fig . 2d , lower panels ) . When I FA / A647 was co - pulsed with 10 fold excess free FA , it was successfully competed out ( Fig . 2f , upper panels ) . I A647 without an FA tag also showed no uptake . When IA2 . 2 cells lacking the folate receptor were pulsed with I FA / A647 no uptake was observed ( Fig . 2f , lower panels ) . This indicates that uptake of I FA / A647 needs the folate tag and occurs via the folate receptor pathway ( Fig . 2f - g ) . Further , the internalization efficiency showed a sinusoidal pattern as a function of nucleotide position , with a periodicity that matches the pitch of a B - DNA helix ( Figure 2c ) . This proves monofunctionalization of DNA architectures in bulk solution28 , 29 . Given that monofunctionalized DNA icosahedra mark a specific endocytic route , we combined this with I QD bearing an FA tag at position 11 ( I QDFA ) . I QDFA was efficiently uptaken and colocalized with Tf A488 showing specific targeting of I QDFA along the folate pathway ( Fig . 2h , i ) . Thus we could realise molecularly identical I QD s displaying a single ligand on the icosahedral DNA shell accessible to its cognate endocytic receptor . Binding and endocytic uptake of I QDGal3 and I GNPGal3 We confirmed monofunctionalization as well as expanded the range of conjugated endocytic tags by probing the stoichiometry of a cellular lectin , galectin - 3 ( Gal3 ) , conjugated to the DNA icosahedron ( Fig . 3a , Supplementary Fig . 9 ) . DNA icosahedra bearing a surface displayed amine group ( I NH2 ) were each loaded with a solitary 10 nm gold nanoparticle ( GNP10 ) to give I GNPNH2 , as previously described30 . His - tagged Gal3 bearing an engineered cysteine residue ( His - Gal3 / Cys ) was conjugated to I GNPNH2 and purified to give I GNPHis - Gal3 ( Supplementary Fig . S9a , b ) . To I GNPHis - Gal3 deposited on a TEM grid , 5 nm gold nanoparticles bearing Ni - nitrilotriacetate ( GNP5 ) was added . When visualized by TEM , 74 % of 10 nm GNPs were present in close proximity with a GNP5 ( Fig . 3b - d ) . We also observed 23 % of solitary 10 nm GNPs , probably due to I GNPHis - Gal3 orientations on the grid where the Gal3 tag is inaccessible to GNP5 . 3 % of I GNPHis - Gal3 showed more than one proximal GNP5 . Indeed , pure GNP5 solutions show ~ 30 % dimers / oligomers , which cannot be abolished even with strong sonication and dilution ( Supplementary Fig . S10 ) . Non - functionalized I GNP shows no such paired association with GNP5 ( Supplementary Fig S10 ) . Thus , single particle TEM analysis revealed that the robust generation of monofunctionalized , cargo - loaded DNA icosahedra in high yields ( 65 - 90 % ; Fig . 3c ) . Given the exquisite control over mono - functionalization , we tested whether I QDGal3 could be applied to transport QDs or GNPs intracellularly and probe the Gal3 endocytic pathway . Gal3 binds glycosylated proteins such as β 1 integrin and CD44 that are resident on the plasma membrane of cells . Gal3 then undergoes oligomerization driving biogenesis of morphologically distinct crescent - shaped clathrin - independent carriers ( CLICs ) mediated by Bhatia et al . Page 4 Nat Nanotechnol .

E u r op e P M C F und e r s A u t ho r M a nu s c r i p t s E u r op e P M C F und e r s A u t ho r M a nu s c r i p t s glycosphingolipids31 . CLICs eventually fuse with early / sorting endosomes32 . Using sulfo - MBS chemistry , Gal3 / Cys was conjugated to I QD to give I QDGal3 . We tested the cellular binding and uptake pathway of I QDGal3 by colocalization with fluorescently labeled Gal3 ( Gal3 Cy5 ) ( Fig . 3e , Supplementary Fig . S9a - c ) . I QDGal3 and Gal3 Cy5 bound the plasma membrane of mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) efficiently with quantitative colocalization ( Fig . 3e ) . In the presence of a specific Gal3 competitor such as lactose ( 100 mM ) , binding of both I QDGal3 and Gal3 Cy5 was reduced by 95 % indicating that binding was specific ( Fig . 3f ) . Upon depleting cellular ATP , the scission of Gal3 - induced membrane invaginations is inhibited leading to distinctive , long , tubular plasma membrane invaginations31 . When I QDGal3 and Gal3 Cy5 were incubated with ATP - depleted cells on ice for 30 min , both I QDGal3 and Gal3 Cy5 colocalized in long , tubular plasma membrane invaginations ( Fig . 3g ) . Thus I QDGal3 retains its binding specificity to the cell membrane and induces downstream plasma membrane invagination . Gal3 - induced CLICs are distincitive , crescent - shaped , short , tubular structures as revealed by TEM31 . To unequivocally prove that I QDGal3 is internalized by the Gal3 pathway , we sought to visualize I Gal3 within such CLICs . To facilitate visualization by TEM , we created I GNPGal3 , encapsulating 5 - 6 GNPs of ~ 5 nm diameter30 . MEFs were incubated with Gal3 conjugated to horseradish peroxidase ( Gal3 - HRP ) and I GNPGal3 in a 1 : 1 ratio and HRP was developed using 3 , 3 ' - diaminobenzidine - H 2 O 2 . TEM ( see methods ) images of these cells clearly revealed crescent shaped structures near the plasma membrane - the definitive signature of CLICs ( Fig . 4a - c ) . Under low contrast conditions , CLICs containing clusters of 5 nm GNPs could clearly be seen , indicating that I GNPGal3 and Gal3 - HRP are endocytosed together into CLICs ( Fig . 4b - c , right panels ) . From two independent experiments , comprising 25 cells , 94 % of GNPs localized in DAB precipitate - positive structures ( Fig . 4b , c ) , confirming that I GNPGal3 adopts the same pathway as Gal3 . Consistent with literature , 78 % of the intracellular structures had CLIC morphology31 . To address the endocytic fate of these particles , I QDGal3 and Gal3 - Cy5 were co - incubated with MEFs for 2 , 15 and 60 min ( Fig . 4d , Supplementary fig . S15 ) . At 2 min , I QDGal3 and Gal3 - Cy5 colocalized in small vesicular structures close to the plasma membrane ( Fig . 4d , upper panel ) . At 15 min , they colocalized in larger punctate structures , likely corresponding to early / sorting endosomes31 ( Fig . 4d , middle panel ) . At 60 min , I QDGal3 and Gal3 - Cy5 colocalized in large , ring - like , perinuclear structures , likely corresponding to late endosomes ( Fig . 4d , lower panel ) . This quantitative colocalization with Gal3 - Cy5 along the entire pathway ( Pearson’s coefficient > 0 . 8 , Spearman’s coefficient > 0 . 9 and Mander’s coefficient > 0 . 9 at all time points ) , confirmed that post attachment of Gal3 , I QD does not alter Gal3 internalization characteristics . Single molecule tracking of I QDSTxB uptake in live cells The B - subunit of Shiga toxin ( STxB ) is a homopentameric protein that binds the glycosphingolipid Gb3 on the plasma membrane of particular eukaryotic cells . Post binding , STxB pentamers cluster to drive the formation of membrane invaginations that undergo dynamin , endophilin - A2 and actin - dependent scission to form endocytic carriers that then fuse with early endosomes33 – 35 , followed by further trafficking along the retrograde Bhatia et al .

E u r op e P M C F und e r s A u t ho r M a nu s c r i p t s E u r op e P M C F und e r s A u t ho r M a nu s c r i p t s route36 . An STxB variant carrying an engineered cysteine residue at its C - terminal end was coupled to monofunctionalized I QD s , as described earlier ( Supplementary figs S11 - 13 ) to give I QDSTxB . Alexa488 labeled STxB ( STxB A488 ) and I QDSTxB efficiently bound the plasma membrane , were internalized into punctate structures and colocalized with each other ( Fig . 5a , b ) . Further , I QDSTxB localized in early endosomes ( EE ) via the STxB internalization pathway ( Supplementary Fig . S14 & S17 ) . Given the specific uptake of I QDSTxB and photostability of QDs , we investigated the dynamics of STxB - mediated endocytic transport by real - time TIRF microscopy , with single particle precision ( Supplementary Fig . S16 ) . HeLa cells were pulsed with a mixture of ~ 200 nM unlabelled STxB doped with 50 pM I QDSTxB . This induced efficient clustering of STxB on the membrane that incorporated I QDSTxB within larger STxB clusters . Upon internalisation , I QDSTxB disappeared from the plasma membrane plane of observation ( Fig . 5c , left panel , Supplementary movie S1 ) . Before internalization , most I QDSTxB particles undergo hop diffusion characterized by motion in confined spaces followed by sudden jumps ( Fig . 5c , middle and right panels , Supplementary movie S2 ) . I QDSTxB diffusion on the extracellular leaflet of the plasma membrane therefore follows a complex diffusion behaviour that suggests picket - fence type compartmentalization by the underlying actin meshwork , as seen in phospholipids37 . Compartment sizes characterized by the confined diffusion ranged from 30 - 80 nm with average diffusion coefficients of 0 . 12 µm 2 / s , similar to those observed for transferrin receptors38 . Endosomes containing I QDSTxB colocalized with and moved along microtubules actively , ( Fig . 5d , Supplementary movie S3 ) , transferring back and forth between microtubules ( Supplementary movie S4 ) . Endosomes showed bursts of active transport with pause intervals indicating either normal or confined diffusive behaviour respectively ( Fig . 5e ) . A single endosome switches between these two modes , with active bursts showing run lengths of 2 . 4 ± 1 . 4 µm and average speeds of 0 . 5 ± 0 . 2 µm / s . We used mean square displacement analysis ( MSD ) from where α values were used to characterize the spectrum of motion observed for a population of endosomes . A measure of the scaling exponent , α < 0 . 4 indicates confined motion , 0 . 4 < α < 1 . 45 indicates diffusive motion , while α > 1 . 45 indicates directed motion . The observed distribution of α values in our data ( see SI , methods ) reveals that a majority of endosomes , at any given time display either confined or diffusive behaviour ( Fig . 5e ) . This average value is similar to velocities observed in previous studies of Rab5 positive endosomes , suggesting that most of the motile I QDSTxB observed are in early endosomes39 . Stochastic active bursts result in the overall transport of endosomes . The active motions also showed reversals , suggesting that both plus and minus end microtubule - associated motors are present on the endosomes . The observed pauses may arise from several phenomena : endosomes crossing over at intersections of microtubules , interaction with ER , actin meshwork or other organelles40 , 41 . Endosomes containing I QDSTxB could be categorized into static early endosomes ( SEE ) and dynamic endosomes ( DE ) , as observed previously for transmembrane cargo and viral particles42 . Internalized I QDSTxB actively moved and fused with SEE ( Fig . 5f , yellow arrows ) . Small vesicles containing I QD STxB emerge from these SEE and then move actively , constituting dynamic endosomes ( DE ) ( Fig . 5f , white arrows ) . The broad range of α values reflects the crowded nature of the intracellular milieu and the interaction of I QDSTxB containing endosomes with Bhatia et al . Page 6 Nat Nanotechnol .

Conclusions We show the efficient encapsulation of quantum dots ( QDs ) within a DNA icosahedron in bulk solution . Encapsulation does not alter QD fluorescence properties in vitro or in the cellular milieu . Endocytic uptake assays supported by molecular modeling studies pinpointed residues on the icosahedron that display biological tags most efficiently . By site - specifically monofunctionalizing these icosahedra with endocytic tags we could realize QDs homogenously bearing a single targeting ligand ( folate / Gal3 / STxB ) . This enabled the live tracking of long duration compartment dynamics in cells . This methodology is generalizable across both QDs and endocytic tags , due to the capsular DNA interface . As the icosahedral DNA surface is well defined , one can envisage homogenous oligofunctionalization of I QD s with ligands . These could probe receptor - ligand interactions and oligomerization , whose nature and consequences change with ligand - receptor stoichiometries . Methods Materials The unlabeled and modified , labeled oligonucleotides ( HPLC - purified and lyophilized ) were obtained from IBA GmbH .
