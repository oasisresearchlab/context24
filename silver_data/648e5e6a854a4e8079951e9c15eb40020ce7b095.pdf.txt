Introduction Sarcasm is the lowest form of wit but the highest form of intelligence [ - Oscar Wilde ] Experts on interpersonal interactions , group dynamics , and organizational effectiveness often instruct people to avoid sarcasm , which are expressions intended to humorously communicate one’s meaning through language that signiﬁes the opposite ( Gibbs , 1986 ; Pexman & Olineck , 2002 ) . Because sarcastic remarks often express the poisonous sting of contempt ( Gottman & Silver , 1999 ) , they can undermine relationships and harm communication in organiza - tions . For example , Fredrickson and Losada ( 2005 ) analyzed 60 management teams and identiﬁed sarcasm as a form of negative communication among team members and an important cause of poor performance in struggling teams . The overall experience of sarcasm , however , may be more nuanced . Indeed , various artists and writers take a distinct pleasure in sarcasm , as noted in the opening quote by Oscar Wilde . Despite the potential interpersonal harm sarcasm can cause , organizational members often deploy sarcasm in sensitive inter - personal situations ( e . g . , Dean , Brandes , & Dharwadkar , 1998 ; Gibbs , 1994 ) . Beyond providing plausible deniability , sarcasm , even sarcastic criticism , can be more humorous and memorable than direct communication ( e . g . , Boylan & Katz , 2013 ) , making sarcasm a common form of exchange in the workplace . In the current research , we propose that sarcasm may have pre - viously overlooked psychological and organizational beneﬁts . We hypothesize that both expressing and receiving sarcasm , regardless of its content , can facilitate creativity by increasing abstract think - ing . We also identify a factor , interpersonal trust , that helps reduce the relational cost of sarcasm for both parties but still allow organizations to take advantage of its creative beneﬁts . Previous sarcasm theories have predominately focused on its communication function , in particular that sarcasm is intended and perceived to be more contemptuous than sincerity ( e . g . , Pexman & Olineck , 2002 ; Toplak & Katz , 2000 ) . Very little research has directly examined the relational , cognitive , or behavioral effects of sarcasm . Only a single article has explored the causal link between sarcasm and creativity , ﬁnding that third - party observers of an angry sarcastic exchange showed increased cre - ativity ( Miron - Spektor , Efrat - Treister , Rafaeli , & Schwarz - Cohen , 2011 ) . Thus , a number of questions around conceptualization , http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . obhdp . 2015 . 07 . 001 0749 - 5978 / (cid:2) 2015 Elsevier Inc .

Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes 131 ( 2015 ) 162 – 177 Contents lists available at ScienceDirect Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes journal homepage : www . elsevier . com / locate / obhdp generalizability , causal mechanism and potential cost remain unanswered . The current research sought to go beyond existing theories and empirical work in four important ways . First , we demonstrate that any and all forms of sarcastic exchanges , not just those involving anger or using ‘‘a literal positive meaning to communicate a nega - tive message’’ ( Miron - Spektor et al . , 2011 ) , can enhance creativity . This ensures the generalizability of our theory , one of the most important criteria of good theories in the social sciences ( Sutton & Staw , 1995 ) . Second , we establish that sarcasm increases creativ - ity for sarcasm expressers and recipients even though they may have different affective and relational experiences from each other and from those of the observers . Third , we explain why the act of constructing and interpreting sarcasm both activate the same underlying cognitive mechanism – abstract thinking – and how this process accounts for the increased creativity in both expres - sers and recipients . Fourth , we identify a relational cost ( i . e . , inter - personal conﬂict ) and explore trust as a factor that minimizes conﬂict but still allows sarcasm to enhance creativity . To tie all of these effects together , we present a generalizable and parsimonious model that delineates how the effect of all types of sarcasm on creativity occurs in both expressers and recipients . Our model is not captured by previous research as it generalizes across both content ( e . g . , from angry to critical to playful ) and role ( i . e . , both expressers and recipients ) , while also establishing the precise mechanism linking sarcasm to creativity . We also present a theory - driven and nuanced look at the relational cost of sarcasm as well as its reduction . The current research has theoretical and empirical implications for a number of areas in organizational behavior . It signiﬁcantly extends the emerging literatures on sarcasm’s cognitive and behavioral effects ( Miron - Spektor et al . , 2011 ) , by providing some of the ﬁrst evidence that certain forms of humor can promote cre - ativity through a cognitive ( vs . affective ) route ( e . g . , Martin , 2007 ) . It also suggests new theoretical and empirical endeavors for inves - tigating the role of sarcasm in other organizational phenomena that are facilitated by abstract thinking ( Trope & Liberman , 2010 ) . Finally , it signiﬁcantly extends the literature on sarcasm’s relational consequences ( e . g . , Toplak & Katz , 2000 ) by exploring factors that minimize its downside . 2 . Sarcasm : An instigator of conﬂict Sarcasm involves the construction of or exposure to contradic - tions between stated and intended meanings . It is the most typical form of verbal irony and often used to humorously convey thinly veiled disapproval , contempt , and scorn , as in the case of sarcastic criticisms ( e . g . , Gibbs , 2000 ) . For instance , a boss catching his assis - tant surﬁng the Internet may state , ‘‘Pat , don’t work too hard ! ’’ to express disapproval . Much more so than other basic forms of ﬁgu - rative language ( e . g . , hyperbole , understatement , metaphor , etc . ) , sarcasm is used to express negative emotions in a way that can be humorous and memorable ( Kreuz , Long , & Church , 1991 ; Roberts & Kreuz , 1994 ) , making it a likely antecedent of conﬂict but also potential cognitive beneﬁts . Indeed , sarcasm is often considered a form of hostile humor , one of the four main types of humor or humor styles ( e . g . , Martin , Puhlik - Doris , Larsen , Gray , & Weir , 2003 ; the other three types are afﬁliative , self - enhancing , and self - deprecating humor ) . However , unlike other forms of humor , sarcasm is often harmful to individuals’ well - being and interpersonal relations ( Bowes & Katz , 2011 ; Colston , 1997 ; Freud , 1928 ) even when the recipients themselves agree that the statements are humorous ( e . g . , Toplak & Katz , 2000 ) . Sarcasm expressers are also often fully aware of its hurtfulness and aggravating nature ( e . g . , Colston , 1997 ; Toplak & Katz , 2000 ) . Although sarcasm can be used to criticize , there are many non - contemptuous uses of sarcasm . Organizational members often communicate positive messages through sarcasm ( e . g . , saying ‘‘you look terrible’’ to someone who is clearly dressed up for an impor - tant meeting ) , in order to praise without embarrassing the recipi - ents or losing their own status ( Jorgensen , 1996 ) . Other times , sarcasm is simply used as light - hearted bantering ( e . g . , saying ‘‘we special ordered this weather for you’’ to a new colleague com - ing to work for the ﬁrst time during a snow storm ) . However , even these well - meaning remarks are perceived to be more contemptuous than their sincere versions ( Dews & Winner , 1995 ; Pexman & Olineck , 2002 ) . Thus , regardless of how critical the sarcasm is intended to be , interpersonal conﬂict , namely the awareness of discrepancies , incompatible wishes or irreconcilable desires ( e . g . , Jehn & Mannix , 2001 ) , is the most obvious potential consequence of sarcasm for both the expressers and recipients . Hypothesis 1 . Expressing or receiving sarcastic ( vs . sincere or neutral ) remarks increases a sense of conﬂict . 3 . Sarcasm : A catalyst for creativity Although interpersonal conﬂict may be the most intuitive effect of any forms of sarcastic exchanges , sarcasm may also generate cognitive and behavioral beneﬁts . Speciﬁcally , we propose that general forms of sarcasm may stimulate creativity , the generation of ideas , insights , or problem solutions that are novel and useful ( e . g . , Sternberg & O’Hara , 1999 ) , in both sarcasm expressers and recipients . For example , all forms of sarcastic exchanges , not just sarcastic anger or criticism , seem to exercise the brain more than direct exchanges , as shown in the neural activity of people exposed to sarcastic versus sincere statements ( e . g . , McDonald , 1999 ; Uchiyama et al . , 2006 ) . More speciﬁcally , because all forms of sar - casm involve conveying one’s meaning by using language that sig - niﬁes the opposite ( e . g . , Pexman & Olineck , 2002 ) , sarcasm often makes salient contradictory notions . As a result , both constructing and making sense of any type of sarcasm necessitate recognizing and reconciling disparate ideas ( Shamay - Tsoory , Tomer , Berger , & Aharon - Peretz , 2003 ) , making sarcasm a potential facilitator of cre - ativity for both sides of the exchange ( e . g . , Ferris , 1972 ; Koestler , 1964 ; Murdock & Ganim , 1993 ; Rouff , 1975 ; Schooler & Melcher , 1995 ; Treadwell , 1970 ; Wicker , 1985 ) . Therefore , although previ - ous research has only theorized on and demonstrated a link between sarcastic anger and creativity for third party observers ( Miron - Spektor et al . , 2011 ) , we argue that creative beneﬁts should accrue across any type of sarcastic exchange and for both sarcasm expressers and recipients . In hypothesizing a generalizable yet parsimonious link between general forms of sarcasm and creativity , one that occurs for both expressers and recipients , it is important to identify whether a common underlying mechanism exists across content and role . After reviewing research that could shed light on the causal mech - anism for the sarcasm - creativity link , we found that existing work unpacking the humor - creativity link has largely focused on an affective route ( Martin , 2007 ; O’Quin & Derks , 1997 ) , demonstrat - ing that individuals exposed to humorous materials ( e . g . , bloopers from a comedy ﬁlm ) or instructed to be humorous experienced more positive mood which then led to more creative performance ( Isen & Daubman , 1984 ; Isen , Daubman , & Nowicki , 1987 ; Morreall , 1991 ; Ziv , 1976 , 1983 , 1989 , chap . 4 ) . However , the liter - ature alluding to sarcasm’s effect on mood has been equivocal . Some research suggests that sarcasm ( vs . sincerity ) may reduce positive mood and exacerbate negative mood , with recipients L . Huang et al . / Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes 131 ( 2015 ) 162 – 177 163 suffering more than expressers ( e . g . , Bowes & Katz , 2011 ; Colston , 1997 ; Leggitt & Gibbs , 2000 ; Pexman & Olineck , 2002 ) . 1 Other research indicates that sarcasm can boost positive mood and allevi - ate negative mood for both expressers and recipients ( e . g . , Dews , Kaplan , & Winner , 1995 ; Jorgensen , 1996 ; Leak , 1974 ; Singer , 1968 ) . 2 The mixed results suggest that mood is unlikely to be the common mechanism for sarcasm to increase creativity for both expressers and recipients . Instead , we propose that a cognitive mechanism is a more promising path in explaining the sarcasm – creativity link . Although one recent article has also postulated a cognitive route ( Miron - Spektor et al . , 2011 ) predicting that sarcastic anger would enhance creativity in third party observers by increasing their cog - nitive complexity , this work actually found no correlation between sarcasm ( vs . neutrality ) and cognitive complexity or between cog - nitive complexity and creativity . This may be because cognitive complexity , also known as evaluative differentiation , entails recog - nizing contradictions and clarifying distinctions between contra - dictory elements ( Kelly , 1955 ) , a process that may not enhance creativity and could actually obstruct creative associations and exacerbate functional ﬁxedness ( Duncker , 1945 ; Smith , Ward , & Schumacher , 1993 ) . In contrast to this prior work , we suggest a dif - ferent cognitive route : abstract thinking . Abstract thinking is a cognitive processing style that captures the superordinate and general ( vs . incidental and contextualized ) features of events ( Trope & Liberman , 2010 ) . Consider the example of voting . At the very concrete level , one is circling the name of a candidate on paper . At a more abstract level , one is contributing to democracy . Or take an example of behavior at work . ‘‘Work harder’’ and ‘‘don’t work too hard’’ are two concrete and distinct manifestations of a more abstract event , ‘‘Conduct yourself appropriately’’ . We propose that both sarcasm construction and sarcasm inter - pretation are conducive to abstract thinking , regardless of the con - tent of the communication . During sarcastic exchanges , expressers construct a stated meaning that contradicts the intended meaning while recipients infer the intended meaning and recognize its difference from the stated meaning ( e . g . , Grice , 1975 ; Kumon - Nakamura , Glucksberg , & Brown , 1995 ) . This contradiction between the stated meaning and the intended meaning renders sarcasm a natural source of psychological distance . The core of Construal Level theory states that traversing psychological dis - tance is made possible by abstract thinking ( Trope & Liberman , 2010 ) . Therefore , we hypothesize that abstract thinking is a com - mon cognitive experience for sarcasm expressers and recipients . Although the content of sarcasm may vary ( e . g . , critical or uncriti - cal ) and the expressers and recipients may go through different emotional experiences or have different interpretations of a sarcas - tic statement’s humorousness ( Bowes & Katz , 2011 ; Toplak & Katz , 2000 ) , we propose that the same abstract cognitive processing style is activated in both sarcasm expressers and recipients . Let’s return to our sarcastic statement uttered to someone who is surﬁng the Internet at work , ‘‘don’t work too hard’’ , and its intended meaning , ‘‘work harder’’ . Both the sarcastic statement and intended meaning are concrete , context - speciﬁc exemplars of the more abstract construal of the communication , ‘‘conduct yourself appropriately’’ . From the expressers’ perspective , abstract thinking allows them to move from the concrete ‘‘work harder’’ to the more abstract ‘‘conduct yourself appropriately’’ , which then allow them to construct the context - speciﬁc ( and deliberately context - contradicting ) statement ‘‘don’t work too hard’’ . From the recipients’ perspective , abstract thinking allows them to move from the context - speciﬁc ( and obviously context - contradicting ) ‘‘don’t work too hard’’ to the more abstract ‘‘conduct yourself appropriately’’ , which then makes more accessible the context - speciﬁc interpretation ‘‘work harder’’ . As such , to construct or interpret sarcasm is to traverse the psychological distance between the stated and the intended meaning through abstract thinking . A large body of research suggests that an abstract cognitive pro - cessing style produces greater creativity . Empirically , decades of work have shown that both abstract thinking and creativity are consistently linked to right - hemispheric activation in the brain ( e . g . , Fink et al . , 1996 ; Mihov , Denzler , & Förster , 2010 ) . More importantly , abstract thinking also mediates the effect of various forms of psychological distance on creativity ( e . g . , Henderson & Wakslak , 2010 ; Jia , Hirt , & Karpen , 2009 ; Krüger , Fiedler , Koch , & Alves , 2013 ; Liberman , Polack , Hameiri , & Blumenfeld , 2012 ) . Theoretically , abstract thinking can increase creativity in two ways . First , concrete thinking renders common associations overly accessible , whereas abstract thinking promotes diverse and novel solutions by reducing the dominance of any single solution ( e . g . , Ward , Patterson , & Sifonis , 2004 ) . Second , general information obtained through abstract thinking makes the same object , behav - ior , or event relevant in many more contexts , leading to possible solutions that were not there before ( e . g . , when the box in the Duncker Candle Problem was construed more abstractly as a ‘‘con - tainer’’ instead of more concretely as a ‘‘container of thumb tacks’’ ; Finke , 1995 ; Schooler & Melcher , 1995 ; Ward , 1995 ) . We therefore argue that the higher level of abstract thinking triggered by sar - casm is a cognitive mechanism that leads to more creative behavior . Hypothesis 2 . Expressing or receiving sarcastic ( vs . sincere or neutral ) remarks increases creativity . Hypothesis 3 . Expressing or receiving sarcastic ( vs . sincere or neu - tral ) remarks increases abstract thinking . Hypothesis 4 . The positive effect of expressing or receiving sarcas - tic ( vs . sincere or neutral ) remarks on creativity is mediated through increased abstract thinking . 4 . Leveraging the beneﬁts of sarcasm : Satirizing with trusted others enhances creativity without conﬂict Because sarcasm can be a double - edged sword , it is important to understand how to take advantage of its creative beneﬁts with - out suffering its relational costs . One possibility is interpersonal trust , the ‘‘hallmark’’ of relationship quality ( Dirks , 1999 ) . Interpersonal trust is the willingness to accept vulnerability based on positive expectations of another’s intentions or behavior ( e . g . , Rousseau , Sitkin , Burt , & Camerer , 1998 ) . Given trust’s notable role 1 More so than recipients , expressers tend to ﬁnd sarcasm ( vs . sincere remarks ) more amusing and less aggressive ; more so than the expressers , outside observers ﬁnd sarcasm ( vs . sincere remarks ) more amusing and less aggressive ( Bowes & Katz , 2011 ; Toplak & Katz , 2000 ) . As a result , if the creative beneﬁts of sarcasm are driven by the positive experiences with sarcasm , then active participants of a sarcastic exchange , especially the recipients , may not enjoy as much creative beneﬁt as the observers . It is therefore critical to study the perspectives of actual sarcasm participants and to also explore non - affective mechanisms for sarcasm’s potential creativity effect . 2 It is also possible that the content of sarcasm may moderate the effect of sarcasm on mood . For example , although both sarcastic compliments and sarcastic criticisms are considered more mocking and conﬂict - fueling than sincere statements , sarcastic ( vs . sincere ) compliments are rated as less positive whereas sarcastic ( vs . sincere ) criticisms are seen as more positive ( e . g . , Toplak & Katz , 2000 ) . Therefore , it is conceivable that sarcasm would have a positive effect on mood when used to criticize but would have a negative effect on mood when otherwise employed . We did not make a priori hypotheses on mood . We did examine it in multiple studies as a potential alternative explanation . 164 L . Huang et al . / Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes 131 ( 2015 ) 162 – 177 as a ‘‘social lubricant’’ and its well - established conﬂict - reduction effects in organizations ( Arrow , 1974 ; Lindskold , 1978 ) , individuals should experience a lower sense of conﬂict when interacting with someone they trust vs . distrust , regardless of the nature of their exchange . That said , we argue that the effect of trust should be particularly valuable in situations where others’ intentions are somewhat ambiguous , such as during a sarcastic conversation ( Katz , Blasko , & Kazmerski , 2004 ) . During a sarcastic conversation , trust should promote more positive interpretations of sarcasm because individ - uals expect benevolent intentions from those they trust ( McEvily , Perrone , & Zaheer , 2003 ) . In contrast , the intention of a sincere remark is often self - evident and thus its interpretation affected less by trust . Therefore , as suggested by Hypothesis 1 , recipients should experience sarcastic ( vs . sincere ) remarks from someone they dis - trust as more contemptuous and conﬂict - provoking , but sarcasm’s conﬂict - exacerbating effect should decrease when the recipients trust the expressers . Similarly , because individuals often expect reciprocity from those they trust or distrust ( Huang & Murnighan , 2010 ) , expressers are more likely to expect their sar - castic remarks to be seen by recipients they distrust as conﬂict - provoking , whereas this effect should be weakened when the expressers trust the recipients . Interpersonal trust is clearly not the only factor that may fend off conﬂict in the workplace or in social relationships more gener - ally . However , among the other organizational , interpersonal and individuals factors that may reduce interpersonal conﬂict , such as liking , Leader - Member Exchange ( LMX , Gerstner & Day , 1997 ) , and personality traits ( e . g . , agreeableness , Graziano , Jensen - Campbell , & Hair , 1996 ) , trust seems particularly well - suited as a moderator for the sarcasm - conﬂict effect . Unlike LMX , which targets the dyadic relationship between a leader and a member ( Gerstner & Day , 1997 ) , trust is relevant to exchanges between individuals at the same hierarchical level . Similarly , trust goes beyond liking or personality traits to create person - speciﬁc expectations about the trustee and the interaction with them . Therefore , trust is unique in potentially preventing malevolent interpretation of sarcasm and in reducing the conﬂict generated by sarcastic exchanges across a range of relationships . Hypothesis 5 . The positive effect of expressing or receiving sarcastic ( vs . sincere or neutral ) remarks on perceptions of conﬂict will be reduced when individuals express the remarks to or receive the remarks from someone they trust . Although trust may decrease sense of conﬂict during sarcastic exchanges , it is less likely to negatively affect creativity . For exam - ple , one’s trust and distrust toward others do not seem to differen - tially affect their information search , a key antecedent of creativity ( e . g . , Sinaceur , 2010 ) . In fact , trust in others , through creating a sense of connection , may even play a positive role in individuals’ willingness to engage in innovative behavior ( Carmeli & Spreitzer , 2009 ) . We therefore expected that one’s trust toward others would have a neutral or positive effect on creativity regard - less of whether an exchange was sarcastic or sincere . 5 . Overview We conducted four experiments to investigate our ﬁve hypotheses . Experiments 1 and 2 tested Hypotheses 1 and 2 , exam - ining whether sarcasm increases both conﬂict and creativity . Experiment 3 tested Hypotheses 3 and 4 , which predicted that sar - casm increases abstract thinking and that abstract thinking medi - ates the effect of sarcasm on creativity . Experiments 1 – 3 also examined alternative mechanisms speculated on by previous research , i . e . , mood and cognitive complexity . Experiment 4 tested Hypothesis 5 , which predicted that trust reduces the effect of sar - casm on conﬂict . Overall , we employed two sarcasm manipulations that aimed at activating expressers’ and recipients’ experience of general forms of sarcasm and three creativity tasks to demonstrate ( a ) a robust relationship between general forms of sarcasm and creativity for both sarcasm expressers and recipients , ( b ) the mechanism ( s ) for this relationship , and ( c ) a method to mitigate sarcasm’s relational cost while preserving its creative beneﬁt . 6 . Experiment 1 : Simulated sarcasm on conﬂict and creativity Experiment 1 examined Hypotheses 1 and 2 – expressing or receiving sarcasm triggers a sense of conﬂict and promotes creativ - ity . It also examined the potential mediating role of mood . We manipulated sarcasm through a simulated conversation task , which did not specify the content of sarcasm ( e . g . , angry , critical , playful , etc . ) so that it could better capture general forms of sarcasm . We also extensively pretested the task to ensure its validity . 6 . 1 . Pretest The simulated conversation task consists of a modiﬁed version of the Picture - Frustration Study ( P - FS , Rosenzweig , Clark , & Helen , 1946 ) . It ostensibly assessed participants’ conversation skills through their responses to others’ comments ( see Appendix A for an example item ) . 3 To ensure that this task manipulates the experience of expressing ( or receiving ) sarcasm or sincerity , we con - ducted a pretest in which one hundred and one Americans ( 34 males , 67 females ; age 18 – 69 , M = 36 , SD = 13 . 64 ) were randomly assigned to a 2 ( sarcasm vs . sincerity ) by 2 ( expresser vs . recipient ) design . In the expressing - sarcasm condition , participants wrote in empty bubbles the ﬁrst sarcastic reply that came to mind . In the receiving - sarcasm condition , participants imagined that the person who was shown speaking had said those words sarcastically to them and provided the ﬁrst reply that came to mind . In the expressing - sincerity and receiving - sincerity conditions , participants replied by being sincere or imagining that they had been spoken to in a sincere manner . Three raters blind to the conditions indepen - dently coded the replies for how sarcastic they are ( 1 = not sarcastic at all , 11 = extremely sarcastic ; a s > . 90 ) . Their ratings were aver - aged . The expressing - sarcasm manipulation generated more sarcasm in participants’ responses ( M = 7 . 58 , SD = 1 . 80 ) than did the receiving - sarcasm manipulation ( M = 4 . 10 , SD = 2 . 80 ) , t ( 48 ) = 5 . 11 , p < . 001 , d = 1 . 48 , the expressing - sincerity ( M = 1 . 58 , SD = . 53 ) , t ( 47 ) = 16 . 25 , p < . 001 , d = 4 . 52 , or the receiving - sincerity manipula - tion ( M = 1 . 68 , SD = . 98 ) , t ( 46 ) = 14 . 30 , p < . 001 , d = 4 . 07 . The receiving - sarcasm manipulation also generated more sarcasm than did the expressing - sincerity manipulation , t ( 51 ) = 4 . 51 , p < . 001 , d = 1 . 25 , or the receiving - sincerity manipulation , t ( 50 ) = 4 . 10 , p < . 001 , d = 1 . 15 . This pretest demonstrates that the simulated con - versation task is a valid manipulation of the expressing ( or receiving ) of sarcastic or sincere remarks . We therefore proceeded to employ it in Experiment 1 . 3 To ensure that the existing comments , which would appear across all conditions in Experiment 1 , are not inherently sarcastic , a factor that would confound our ﬁndings , we asked 20 Americans ( 8 males , 12 females ; age 20 – 62 , M = 37 . 25 , SD = 12 . 46 ) on MTurk to imagine that they were on the receiving end of these comments and to ( a ) choose whether each comment is neutral , sincere , or sarcastic , and ( b ) rate how neutral , sincere , and sarcastic ( 1 = not al all , 11 = extremely ) each comment is . Eighty percent chose ‘‘sincere’’ , 15 % chose ‘‘neutral’’ , and only 5 % chose ‘‘sarcastic’’ . The neutral ( M = 4 . 58 , SD = 2 . 24 ) and sarcastic ( M = 2 . 33 , SD = 1 . 60 ) ratings were signiﬁcantly lower , t ( 19 ) = 2 . 85 , p = . 01 , d = . 90 , and t ( 19 ) = 10 . 27 , p < . 001 , d = 3 . 24 , and the sincere rating ( M = 8 . 78 , SD = 2 . 09 ) signiﬁcant higher than the mid - point of the scale , t ( 19 ) = 5 . 93 , p < . 001 , d = 1 . 88 . Thus , when presented alone , the existing comments tend to be perceived as sincere . L . Huang et al . / Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes 131 ( 2015 ) 162 – 177 165 6 . 2 . Participants and design One hundred and twelve Americans ( 66 males , 46 females ; age 21 – 62 , M = 34 . 21 , SD = 10 . 39 ) , recruited on MTurk for two dollars , were randomly assigned to an expressing - sarcasm , receiving - sarcasm , expressing - sincerity , receiving - sincerity , or control condition . 6 . 3 . Procedure 6 . 3 . 1 . Manipulations We employed the same simulated conversation task from the pretest to manipulate the experience of expressing ( or receiving ) sarcasm or sincerity . The only difference was the addition of a con - trol condition , in which participants responded to the same exist - ing comment with the very ﬁrst reply that came to mind . No further instructions were given . 6 . 3 . 2 . Creativity Next , participants completed one of the most widely cited cre - ativity tasks , the Remote Association Task ( RAT ) , which captures the identiﬁcation of novel and meaningful connections among seemingly unrelated stimuli ( Mednick , 1968 ) . Participants were asked to ﬁnd a word that was logically linked to the set of three words provided ( e . g . , ‘‘table’’ links ‘‘manners - round - tennis’’ ) . Instructions and two examples were given before 17 real triads ( see Appendix B ) . Participants were instructed to solve as many as possible and to work fast without sacriﬁcing accuracy . The num - ber of correct responses was our measure of creativity . 6 . 3 . 3 . Conﬂict Participants completed a seven - item scale ( a = . 94 ) assessing perceived conﬂict during the simulated conversations ( adapted from Jehn , 1995 ; e . g . , ‘‘There were feelings of hostility among par - ties’’ ) on an 11 - point scale ( 1 = strongly disagree , 11 = strongly agree ) . 6 . 3 . 4 . Mood Participants then completed the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule ( PANAS ; e . g . , excited or upset , 1 = not at all , 5 = extre - mely ; Watson , Clark , & Tellegen , 1988 ) . Additionally , they rated how positive and negative they felt at the moment , using the same scale . 6 . 3 . 5 . Manipulation check Finally , participants reported how much they expressed or imagined that the other parties expressed sarcasm and irony in the simulated conversations ( 1 = strongly disagree , 11 = strongly agree , a = . 82 ) . Because sarcasm is considered a form of humor especially by the expressers ( e . g . , Bowes & Katz , 2011 ) , a procedure that manipulates sarcasm should also increase perceived humor - ousness , at least in the expressers . Therefore , participants also reported how much they were or they thought the other parties were funny , humorous , and playful ( 1 = strongly disagree , 11 = strongly agree , a = . 95 ) . 4 6 . 4 . Results 6 . 4 . 1 . Manipulation check Sarcasm differed signiﬁcantly across conditions , F ( 4 , 105 ) = 40 . 38 , p < . 001 , g p2 = . 61 ( see Table 1 for all means in Experiment 1 ) . Participants expressed signiﬁcantly more sarcasm in the expressing - sarcasm condition than in the expressing - sincerity , t ( 38 ) = 6 . 79 , p < . 001 , d = 2 . 15 , or control condition , t ( 38 ) = 8 . 17 , p < . 001 , d = 2 . 58 , or than they received in the receiving - sincerity condition , t ( 39 ) = 11 . 21 , p < . 001 , d = 3 . 38 .

Participants received signiﬁcantly less sarcasm in the receiving - sincerity condition than they expressed in the expressing - sincerity condition , t ( 43 ) = 2 . 52 , p = . 015 , d = 0 . 75 .

The pattern of the speciﬁc compar - isons was slightly different from sarcasm . Participants in the expressing - sarcasm condition reported being more humorous than they were in the expressing - sincerity condition , t ( 38 ) = 3 . 43 , p = . 001 , d = 1 . 08 , or the control condition , t ( 38 ) = 2 . 85 , p = . 007 , d = . 90 , or than the other parties were in the receiving sarcasm , t ( 41 ) = 4 . 55 , p < . 001 , d = 1 . 36 , or receiving - sincerity condition , t ( 39 ) = 6 . 19 , p < . 001 , d = 1 . 86 . Participants in the receiving - sarcasm condition , however , did not think the other par - ties were more humorous than they were in the receiving - sincerity condition , t ( 46 ) = 1 . 69 , p = . 10 , or than they themselves were in the expressing - sincerity condition , t ( 45 ) = . 73 , p = . 47 , or the control condition , t ( 45 ) = 1 . 26 , p = . 21 . Participants in the receiving - sincerity condition also thought their partners were less humorous than they themselves were in the expressing - sincerity condition , t ( 43 ) = 2 . 21 , p = . 03 , d = . 65 , or the control condition , t ( 43 ) = 2 . 69 , p = . 01 , d = . 80 . The expressing - sincerity and control conditions did not differ , t ( 42 ) = . 50 , p = . 62 . Together , the two manipulation checks demonstrate that the experience of sarcasm was activated in both the expressers and recipients of sarcasm , even though only participants in the expressing - sarcasm condition seemed amused . 6 . 4 . 2 .

Mood Neither the PANAS positive or negative subscale scores , F ( 4 , 107 ) = . 38 , p = . 82 , and F ( 4 , 107 ) = 1 . 28 , p = . 28 , nor the overall pos - itive or negative mood , F ( 4 , 107 ) = . 21 , p = . 93 , and F ( 4 , 107 ) = 1 . 56 , p = . 19 , varied signiﬁcantly across conditions . None of the indirect effects of sarcasm on creativity through any mood measures was signiﬁcant : positive ( point estimate = . 02 ; 95 % bias - corrected con - ﬁdence interval of (cid:2) . 15 to . 31 ) , and negative subscale of the PANAS ( point estimate = . 58 ; 95 % bias - corrected conﬁdence interval of (cid:2) . 41 to 2 . 54 ) ; overall positive ( point estimate = (cid:2) . 0007 ; 95 % bias - corrected conﬁdence interval of (cid:2) . 30 to . 21 ) and negative mood ( point estimate = 1 . 01 ; 95 % bias - corrected conﬁdence inter - val of (cid:2) 2 . 02 to 3 . 04 ) . 6 . 5 . Discussion These ﬁndings support Hypotheses 1 and 2 : Expressing or receiving sarcasm led individuals to perceive a higher sense of con - ﬂict but also increased creativity as compared to expressing or receiving sincerity or having a neutral conversation . However , unlike other forms of humor , sarcasm did not seem to predict mood and mood did not drive the effect on creativity . As the ﬁrst step into our empirical endeavor , Experiment 1 had a few limitations . First , the simulated conversation task we employed may be inherently conﬂict - provoking and the higher sense of conﬂict in the sarcasm conditions might not have emerged in situations that are not already infested with conﬂict . Similarly , although this task did not specify the content of the sarcasm , participants may have only imagined expressing or receiving angry or critical sarcasm only , undermining our focus on general forms of sarcasm . Second , by keeping the existing message the same in the receiving - sarcasm and receiving - sincerity conditions , we varied the intended meaning across these conditions , ( e . g . , ‘‘I am sorry’’ meant ‘‘I am not sorry’’ in the receiving - sarcasm condition ) . Third , we measured mood after the creativity measure . It is possible that , after completing the creativity task , participants’ mood had dissipated and therefore could not be captured . Finally , the RAT task focuses on creative association , so the effect of sarcasm on RAT may not be generalizable to other forms of creativity . 7 . Experiment 2 : Recalled sarcasm on conﬂict and creativity Experiment 2 investigated Hypotheses 1 and 2 using a different sarcasm manipulation and a creative insight task . The new manip - ulation experimentally controlled for the conversation context and the intended meaning of remarks because participants were ran - domly assigned to experimental conditions , in which they sponta - neously recalled their own past experiences with sarcasm or sincerity . This manipulation also provided us with sarcastic remarks that , when combined , convey a host of intents and emo - tions beyond just anger or criticism . Furthermore , two indepen - dent judges coded the recalled content to ensure that they indeed captured general forms of sarcasm . Finally , we captured mood using an implicit measure before the creativity task and an explicit measure after the creativity task . 7 . 1 . Participants and design One hundred and seven Americans ( 43 males , 62 females , 2 unreported ; age 18 – 64 , M = 31 . 51 , SD = 11 . 21 ) , recruited from MTurk for $ 2 , were randomly assigned to an expressing - sarcasm , receiving - sarcasm , expressing - sincerity , receiving - sincerity , or control condition . 7 . 2 . Procedure 7 . 2 . 1 . Manipulations Following numerous procedures manipulating psychological experiences in organizational behavior , we used a recall task to recreate personally relevant experience of sarcasm ( e . g . , Fong , 2006 ) . Participants in the expressing - sarcasm ( receiving - sarcasm ) condition recalled an incident in which they said something Fig . 1 . Mean conﬂict ratings across experiment conditions in Experiment 1 . Error bars indicate ±1 SEM . Fig . 2 . Number of RAT items correctly solved ( creativity ) across experiment conditions in Experiment 1 . Error bars indicate ±1 SEM . L . Huang et al . / Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes 131 ( 2015 ) 162 – 177 167 sarcastic to another person ( someone said something sarcastic to them ) . Participants in the expressing - sincerity ( receiving - sincerity ) condition recalled an incident in which they said something sincere to another person ( someone said something sincere to them ) . The instructions deﬁned ‘‘sarcasm’’ in the sarcasm conditions as ‘‘ex - pressing the opposite of what one thinks or feels with the intention of communicating one’s true meaning’’ , deﬁned ‘‘sincerity’’ in the sincerity conditions as ‘‘speaking and acting truthfully about one’s feelings and thoughts’’ , and asked participants to describe the sit - uation in detail , such as what happened , what they said , what they were thinking , and how they felt . Participants in the control condi - tion recalled their last conversation with someone who asked them for directions or whom they asked for directions . 7 . 2 . 2 . Implicit measure of mood Next , participants completed a ‘‘Word Evaluation Task’’ that asked how pleasant they thought each of ﬁve Chinese words was ( 1 = very unpleasant , 11 = very pleasant ) . 5 Similar to other implicit measures of mood ( e . g . , Hass , Katz , Rizzo , Bailey , & Moore , 1992 ) , this task captures the extent to which individuals project their own mood onto unfamiliar or mood - neutral stimuli and , therefore , serves as an inconspicuous way to measure mood immediately after our manipulations . Isen and Nowicki ( 1983 ) , for example , found that participants in a positive vs . neutral mood rated these unfamiliar words more positively . 7 . 2 . 3 . Creativity Participants then completed the Duncker Candle Problem ( Duncker , 1945 ) . They were presented with a picture containing several objects on a table next to a cardboard wall : a candle , a pack of matches , and a box of tacks . Their task was to ﬁgure out , using only the objects on the table , how to attach the candle to the wall so that it would burn without dripping wax on the table or the ﬂoor . Participants described their solutions in words . The correct solution involves emptying the box of tacks , tacking the box to the wall , and placing the candle inside . It is considered a measure of creative insight because it requires the ability to see objects as performing different functions than indicated by the context ; that is , the box is not just a repository for tacks but can also be used as a stand . 7 . 2 . 4 . Conﬂict The same 7 - item scale from Experiment 1 measured perceived conﬂict ( a = . 94 ) . 7 . 2 . 5 . Explicit measure of mood Finally , participants reported how they felt at the moment on a single Likert scale ( 1 = negative , 11 = positive ) . 7 . 3 . Results 7 . 3 . 1 . Conﬂict Participants’ sense of conﬂict differed signiﬁcantly across condi - tions , F ( 4 , 102 ) = 5 . 12 , p = . 001 , g p2 = . 17 ( see Table 2a and Fig . 3 for means ) . Participants perceived signiﬁcantly more conﬂict in the expressing - sarcasm than in the control condition , t ( 43 ) = 3 . 45 , p = . 001 , d = 1 . 02 . Participants in the receiving - sarcasm condition perceived signiﬁcantly more conﬂict than did those in the control condition , t ( 45 ) = 4 . 77 , p < . 001 , d = 1 . 40 , and marginally more con - ﬂict than did those in the receiving - sincerity condition , t ( 41 ) = 1 . 73 , p = . 09 , d = . 53 . Though we did not predict these differ - ences , we also found that participants in the expressing - sincerity , t ( 40 ) = 3 . 70 , p = . 001 , d = 1 . 12 , and receiving - sincerity conditions , t ( 40 ) = 2 . 45 , p = . 02 , d = . 74 , perceived signiﬁcantly more conﬂict than did those in the control condition . None of the rest of the com - parisons reached signiﬁcance ( p s > . 27 ) . These results provided partial support for Hypothesis 1 . 7 . 3 . 2 . Creativity The likelihood of solving the Duncker Candle Problem differed signiﬁcantly across conditions , v 2 ( 4 , N = 107 ) = 17 . 62 , p = . 001 , u = . 41 ( see Table 2a and Fig . 4 for percentages of participants ) . Participants were signiﬁcantly more likely to solve the problem in the expressing - sarcasm ( 64 % ) than in the expressing - sincerity ( 26 % ) , v 2 ( 1 , N = 41 ) = 5 . 71 , p = . 02 , u = . 37 , receiving - sincerity ( 32 % ) , v 2 ( 1 , N = 42 ) = 4 . 19 , p = . 04 , u = . 32 , or control condition ( 30 % ) , v 2 ( 1 , N = 45 ) = 4 . 98 , p = . 03 , u = . 33 . Participants were signif - icantly more likely to solve the problem in the receiving - sarcasm ( 75 % ) than in the receiving - sincerity , v 2 ( 1 , N = 44 ) = 8 . 11 , p = . 004 , u = . 43 , expressing - sincerity , v 2 ( 1 , N = 43 ) = 10 . 10 , p = . 001 , u = . 49 , or control condition , v 2 ( 1 , N = 47 ) = 9 . 37 , p = . 002 , u = . 45 . None of the rest of the comparisons was signiﬁ - cant ( p s > . 40 ) . These results continue to support Hypothesis 2 . To ensure that the content of sarcasm ( i . e . , anger , criticism ) did not confound the results above , two judges blind to the hypotheses and conditions rated the extent to which the recalled conversa - tions conveyed anger and criticism ( 1 = not at all , 7 = to a great extent ) . 6 The reliabilities between the two judges were high ( a s > . 90 ) and we averaged their scores to create a measure of anger and a measure of criticism . These measures differed signiﬁcantly across conditions , F ( 4 , 102 ) = 3 . 12 , p = . 018 , g p2 = . 11 , and F ( 4 , 102 ) = 8 . 85 , p < . 001 , g p2 = . 26 ( see Table 2b for means and pairwise comparisons ) . We conducted two binary logistic regressions , regressing creativity on condition , each of these two measures , and the interaction between condition and each of them . Neither the main effects of these two measures nor the interaction effects reached signiﬁcance ( p s > . 28 ) , while the main effects of condition remained signiﬁcant , B = . 51 , SE = . 15 , p = . 001 ( anger ) , and B = . 52 , SE = . 16 , p = . 001 ( criticism ) , suggesting that sarcasm’s creativity effect holds regardless of the level of anger or criticism in the sarcasm .

To diversify our methods and maximize our chances of capturing an effect on mood , both our explicit and implicit mood measures in Experiment 2 used bipolar scales . 6 The judges gave 54 . 3 % of the participants in Experiment 2 and 78 . 6 % in Experiment 3 , which employed the same sarcasm manipulation , an anger rating of 1 ( notatall ) . Additionally , theygave 34 . 5 % inExperiment 2and 35 . 7 % inExperiment 3 a criticism rating of 1 ( not at all ) . This suggests that our manipulation did not just capture critical sarcasm or sarcastic anger ( as was the case in Miron - Spektor et al . , 2011 ) . Instead it is consistent with our broader conceptualization of sarcasm and our focus on general forms of sarcasm . 168 L . Huang et al . / Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes 131 ( 2015 ) 162 – 177 7 . 3 . 3 . Mood No signiﬁcant main effects were found for the implicit or expli - cit measures of mood , F s < 1 . 34 , p s > . 25 , nor were there any signif - icant differences between speciﬁc conditions ( see Table 2a for means ) . 7 The indirect effect of sarcasm on creativity through the implicit ( point estimate = (cid:2) . 01 ; 95 % bias - corrected conﬁdence inter - val of (cid:2) . 19 to . 10 ) or explicit mood measure ( point estimate = . 0002 ; 95 % bias - corrected conﬁdence interval of (cid:2) . 11 to . 13 ) was not signif - icant either . We again found no support for the mediating role of mood . 7 . 4 . Discussion The ﬁrst two studies provide consistent evidence that ( a ) expressing or receiving sarcasm , as compared to expressing or receiving sincerity or having a neutral conversation , promotes cre - ativity , supporting Hypothesis 2 , and that ( b ) sarcasm is not a reli - able antecedent of mood and mood is not a reliable mechanism through which sarcasm promotes creativity . These two studies also provide partial support for Hypothesis 1 , which states that expressing or receiving sarcasm increases a sense of conﬂict . Although it is less clear from the current data whether expressing or receiving sarcasm vs . sincere remarks is more conﬂict - provoking , expressing or receiving sarcasm , as compared to having a neutral conversation , heightens a sense of conﬂict . 8 . Experiment 3 : Sarcasm increases creativity through abstract thinking The third study investigated Hypotheses 3 and 4 , which pre - dicted that expressing or receiving sarcasm ( not just sarcastic anger or criticism ) leads to abstract thinking , which , in turn , medi - ates the effect of sarcasm on creativity . Additionally , it further examined the possible role of mood and cognitive complexity as alternative mechanisms . Experiment 3 also sought to address some methodological lim - itations with Experiment 2 . First , it included manipulation checks to ensure the validity of the recall task . Second , because the candle task in Experiment 2 is relatively well known and some of the par - ticipants may have had prior knowledge of its correct solution , we adopted a different measure of creative insight . Finally , both Experiments 1 and 2 used online samples . Although peer - reviewed research has demonstrated that the data obtained through MTurk are at least as reliable as those obtained via tradi - tional methods ( e . g . , Buhrmester , Kwang , & Gosling , 2011 ) , it was still important to replicate our main ﬁndings using a laboratory study on a different sample of participants . 8 . 1 . Participants and design One hundred and fourteen students ( 43 males , 71 females ; age 18 – 34 , M = 20 . 02 , SD = 2 . 30 ) were recruited from a large East Coast university for a compensation of ten dollars . They were randomly assigned to an expressing - sarcasm , receiving - sarcasm , expressing - sincerity , receiving - sincerity , or control condition . 8 . 2 . Procedure 8 . 2 . 1 . Manipulations The same recall task from Experiment 2 manipulated the expe - rience of expressing or receiving sarcasm , expressing or receiving sincerity , and a neutral conversation , once again ensuring that we captured general , as opposed to any speciﬁc , forms of sarcasm . 8 . 2 . 2 . Abstract thinking Participants then completed a Behavior Identiﬁcation Form ( BIF , Vallacher & Wegner , 1989 ) , assessing the level at which individuals construe everyday actions . This state measure has been used extensively in construal - level research to assess abstract thinking as the outcome of various experimental manipulations ( e . g . , Smith & Trope , 2006 ) . Each of the 25 items presented a target behavior ( e . g . , ‘‘voting’’ ) and asked participants which of two descriptions they preferred : one describing the behavior at a con - crete level ( e . g . , ‘‘marking a ballot’’ ) and one at an abstract level ( e . g . , ‘‘inﬂuencing the election’’ ) . The more actions identiﬁed at the abstract level , the more abstract participants’ thinking was . 8 . 2 . 3 . Cognitive complexity Following Miron - Spektor et al . ( 2011 ) , who measured cognitive complexity with the Role Construct Repertory Test ( ‘‘Rep test’’ ) Fig . 3 . Mean conﬂict ratings across experimental conditions in Experiment 2 . Error bars indicate ±1 SEM . Fig . 4 . Percentages of participants who solved the Dunker’s Candle Problem ( creativity ) across experimental conditions in Experiment 2 .

L . Huang et al . / Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes 131 ( 2015 ) 162 – 177 169 developed by Kelly ( 1955 ) and used in Bieri ( 1955 ) , we employed a simpliﬁed version developed by Bieri et al . ( 1966 ) that received support for its reliability and validity in Menasco and Curry ( 1978 ) . The Rep test is designed to yield a measure of cognitive complexity based on the number of differentiations made in eval - uating given role types . It is presented in grid form with role types as columns and bipolar adjectives as rows ( see Appendix C ) . The test is scored by totaling the number of tied ratings a participant assigns to a given role type . That is , a score of 1 is assigned for every rating that is equal to any of the ratings below it . The mini - mum score per role type is then 4 ( over the 10 bipolar adjectives ) . The maximum score per role type is 45 , in which case all 10 ratings are exactly the same . The overall cognitive complexity scores for the 10 role types therefore can range from 40 to 450 . High scores represent less complexity , since they indicate participants’ inabil - ity to discriminate a role type on the dimensions represented by the adjectives . 8 8 . 2 . 4 . Creativity Next , participants worked on a creative insight task , the Olive in a Glass problem ( see Appendix D ) . They were presented with a pic - ture containing a ‘‘glass’’ made from four matchsticks . Inside the ‘‘glass’’ sits a dot representing an ‘‘olive’’ . Their task was to move two and only two matchsticks so that the ‘‘olive’’ would be outside of the ‘‘glass’’ . Participants described their solutions in words . The correct solution involves sliding the matchstick that is the bottom of the glass a half - position to the left ( or right ) and moving the matchstick on the right ( or left ) side of the glass so that it parallels the stem of the glass and serves as the side of the new upside down ‘‘glass’’ . This is considered a measure of creative insight because it involves rejecting the typical but unwarranted assumption that the glass needs to be in the same position or its opening needs to face up . As a result , the solution is both novel and useful . Afterwards , participants also indicated whether they had worked on this prob - lem in the past . 8 . 2 . 5 . Mood As in Experiment 1 , participants completed the PANAS and rated how positive and negative they felt at the moment . 8 . 2 . 6 . Manipulation check Finally , participants reported to what extent they or the other party expressed sarcasm and irony in the conversation they recalled ( 1 = strongly disagree , 11 = strongly agree , a = . 87 ) . As in Experiment 1 , they also reported how much they or the other party was funny , humorous , and playful ( 1 = strongly disagree , 11 = strongly agree , a = . 89 ) . 8 . 3 . Results 8 . 3 . 1 . Manipulation check Sarcasm differed signiﬁcantly across conditions , F ( 4 , 109 ) = 16 . 68 , p < . 001 , g p2 = . 38 ( see Tables 3a for means ) . Participants expressed signiﬁcantly more sarcasm in the expressing - sarcasm condition than in the expressing - sincerity , t ( 37 ) = 4 . 26 , p < . 001 , d = 1 . 36 , or control condition , t ( 41 ) = 5 . 15 , p < . 001 , d = 1 . 55 , or than they received in the receiving - sincerity condition , t ( 42 ) = 4 . 07 , p < . 001 , d = 1 . 23 . Participants perceived signiﬁcantly more sarcasm in the receiving - sarcasm condition than in the receiving - sincerity condition , t ( 48 ) = 5 . 37 , p < . 001 , d = 1 . 52 , or than they expressed in the expressing - sincerity , t ( 43 ) = 5 . 58 , p < . 001 , d = 1 . 67 , or control condition , t ( 47 ) = 6 . 70 , p < . 001 , d = 1 . 91 . None of the other comparisons reached signiﬁcance ( p s > . 27 ) . Humor also differed signiﬁcantly across conditions , F ( 4 , 109 ) = 5 . 79 , p < . 001 , g 2 = . 18 ( see Tables 3a for means ) . The pattern of the speciﬁc comparisons is again slightly different from sarcasm . Participants in the expressing - sarcasm condition reported being more humorous than they were in the expressing - sincerity condi - tion , t ( 37 ) = 4 . 26 , p < . 001 , d = 1 . 27 , or the control condition , t ( 41 ) = 5 . 15 , p < . 001 , d = . 79 , or than the other parties were in the receiving - sincerity condition , t ( 42 ) = 3 . 56 , p = . 001 , d = 1 . 07 . Participants in the receiving - sarcasm condition thought the other parties were more humorous than they were in the receiving - sincerity condition , t ( 48 ) = 2 . 66 , p = . 01 , d = . 75 , or than they themselves were in the expressing - sincerity condition , t ( 43 ) = 2 . 97 , p = . 005 , d = . 90 . But they did not think the other par - ties were more humorous than they themselves were in the control condition , t ( 47 ) = 1 . 62 , p = . 11 . None of the other comparisons reached signiﬁcance ( p s > . 10 ) . Overall , these manipulation checks indicate that our manipulation was effective and that both sarcasm expressers and recipients consider the use of sarcasm humorous . 8 . 3 . 2 .

Removing these ﬁve participants did not change our ﬁndings on creativity . 170 L . Huang et al . / Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes 131 ( 2015 ) 162 – 177 N = 43 ) = 6 . 13 , p = . 013 , u = . 38 . Participants were signiﬁcantly more likely to solve the problem in the receiving - sarcasm condition than in the receiving - sincerity , v 2 ( 1 , N = 50 ) = 4 . 64 , p = . 031 , u = . 31 , expressing - sincerity , v 2 ( 1 , N = 45 ) = 6 . 06 , p = . 014 , u = . 37 , or control condition , v 2 ( 1 , N = 49 ) = 7 . 12 , p = . 008 , u = . 38 . None of the other comparisons reached signiﬁcance ( p s > . 32 ) . Together with Experiments 1 and 2 , the results provide strong support for Hypothesis 2 . To ensure that the content of sarcasm ( i . e . , anger , criticism ) did not confound the results above , same as in Experiment 2 , two judges blind to the hypotheses and conditions again rated the extent to which the recalled conversations expressed anger and criticism ( 1 = not at all , 7 = to a great extent ) . The reliabilities between the two judges were high ( a s > . 93 ) and we averaged their scores to create a measure of anger and a measure of criticism . The two measures differed signiﬁcantly across conditions , F ( 4 , 108 ) = 3 . 74 , p = . 007 , g p2 = . 12 , and F ( 4 , 108 ) = 7 . 70 , p < . 001 , g p2 = . 22 ( see Table 3b for means and pairwise comparisons ) . 10 Two binary logistic regressions regressed creativity on condition , each of these two measures , and the interaction between condition and each of them .

The main effects of condition remained signiﬁcant , B = . 70 , SE = . 25 , p = . 005 ( anger ) , and B = . 73 , SE = . 26 , p = . 005 ( criticism ) , suggesting that the creativ - ity effect of sarcasm holds regardless of the level of anger or criticism in the sarcasm . 8 . 3 . 3 . Abstract thinking Abstract thinking differed signiﬁcantly across conditions , F ( 4 , 109 ) = 4 . 86 , p = . 001 , g p2 = . 15 ( see Table 3a and Fig . 6 for means ) . Participants engaged in signiﬁcantly more abstract thinking in the expressing - sarcasm condition than in the receiving - sincerity , t ( 42 ) = 2 . 38 , p = . 02 , d = . 72 , or control condition , t ( 41 ) = 3 . 16 , p = . 003 , d = . 94 . They also engaged in marginally more abstract thinking than in the expressing - sincerity condition , t ( 37 ) = 1 . 77 , p = . 086 , d = . 56 . Participants engaged in signiﬁcantly more abstract thinking in the receiving - sarcasm condition than in the receiving - sincerity , t ( 48 ) = 2 . 93 , p = . 005 , d = . 83 , expressing - sincerity , t ( 43 ) = 2 . 22 , p = . 03 , d = . 66 , or control condi - tion , t ( 47 ) = 4 . 05 , p < . 001 , d = 1 . 15 . No other comparisons reached signiﬁcance ( p s > . 17 ) . Hypothesis 3 was supported . Two ANOVAs similarly examined the effect of condition , each of the anger and criticism measures , and the interaction between condition and each of them on abstract thinking . Neither the main effects of these measures nor the interaction reached signiﬁcance ( p s > . 10 ) , while the main effects of condition remained signiﬁcant , F ( 3 , 104 ) = 5 . 55 , p = . 001 , g p2 = . 14 ( anger ) , and F ( 3 , 104 ) = 3 . 62 , p = . 016 , g p2 = . 10 ( criticism ) , suggesting that the effect of sarcasm on abstract thinking also holds regardless of the level of anger or criticism in the sarcasm . 8 . 3 . 4 .

Negative mood scores did not vary signiﬁcantly across conditions , F ( 4 , 109 ) = . 52 , p = . 72 . 11 Speciﬁcally , participants reported signiﬁcantly less positive affect on the PANAS positive - affect subscale in the receiving - sarcasm condition than in all the other conditions , including the receiving - sincerity , t ( 48 ) = 2 . 85 , p = . 006 , d = . 80 , expressing - sincerity , t ( 43 ) = 2 . 30 , p = . 026 , d = . 68 , control , t ( 47 ) = 2 . 39 , p = . 02 , d = . 67 , and expressing - sarcasm condition , t ( 40 ) = 2 . 30 , p = . 026 , d = . 69 . They also reported signiﬁcantly less overall positive mood than in the receiving - sincerity , t ( 48 ) = 2 . 19 , p = . 033 , d = . 62 , or expressing - sincerity condition , t ( 43 ) = 2 . 38 , p = . 022 , d = . 73 . Moreover , participants reported signiﬁcantly less negative affect on the PANAS negative - affect subscale in the receiving - sarcasm condition than in the receiving - sincerity , t ( 48 ) = 2 . 16 , p = . 036 , d = . 62 , or control condition , t ( 47 ) = 2 . 16 , p = . 036 , d = . 62 .

None of the rest of the comparisons on any of the mood measures reached signiﬁcance ( p s > . 13 ) . The above ﬁndings suggest that the relationship between sar - casm and mood is complex . Although being the recipient of sar - casm seems to make individuals feel less positive , it also seems to reduce negative feelings , potentially because the humor associated with sarcasm cushions the blow of being mocked ( e . g . , Dews et al . , 1995 ; Jorgensen , 1996 ) . However , given that we did not observe the same patterns in Experiment 1 , which employed the same mood measures , or in Experiment 2 , which employed the same recall manipulation of sarcasm , we cannot draw any ﬁrm conclusions on the relationship between sarcasm and mood . 8 . 3 . 6 . Mediation To examine whether abstract thinking , positive mood , negative mood , or cognitive complexity drove the effect of sarcasm on cre - ativity , we conducted four mediation analyses ( Preacher & Hayes , 2008 ) . Bootstrap analyses using 1000 bootstrap re - samples revealed that the indirect effect of sarcasm on creativity through abstract thinking was signiﬁcant ( point estimate = . 62 ; 95 % bias - corrected conﬁdence interval of . 08 – 1 . 61 ) , hence supporting Hypothesis 4 . However , the indirect effect of sarcasm on creativity was not signiﬁcant through any other measures : the PANAS positive - affect subscale ( point estimate = (cid:2) . 09 ; 95 % bias - corrected conﬁdence interval of (cid:2) . 71 to . 09 ) , the PANAS negative - affect subscale ( point estimate = - . 07 ; 95 % bias - corrected conﬁdence interval of (cid:2) . 53 to . 14 ) , overall positive mood ( point estimate = (cid:2) . 09 ; 95 % bias - corrected conﬁdence inter - val of (cid:2) . 63 to . 16 ) , overall negative mood ( point estimate = . 02 ; 95 % bias - corrected conﬁdence interval of (cid:2) . 22 to . 49 ) , and cogni - tive complexity ( point estimate < . 01 ; 95 % bias - corrected conﬁ - dence interval of (cid:2) . 18 to . 33 ) . 8 . 4 . Discussion The ﬁndings of Experiments 1 – 3 demonstrate that expressing or receiving sarcasm ( not just sarcastic anger or criticism ) reliably increased creativity through abstract thinking , supporting Hypotheses 2 , 3 , and 4 . This effect was observed using two differ - ent manipulations of sarcasm , three different measures of creativ - ity , and a widely cited state measure of abstract thinking , both in the lab and on MTurk . Moreover , although there is some evidence that sarcasm recipients may experience less positive and less neg - ative affects than expressers , consistent with Experiments 1 and 2 , we did not ﬁnd support for the mediating role of mood . We also did not ﬁnd support for the mediating role of cognitive complexity . This is consistent with Miron - Spektor et al . ( 2011 ) who did not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant difference between observing sarcastic expression of anger and observing neutral conversation on cognitive complexity or a signiﬁcant correlation between cognitive complexity and cre - ativity . These ﬁndings provide evidence that sarcasm , despite its negative effect on conﬂict , can produce creative beneﬁts through abstract thinking for both the expressers and recipients . We also conducted a separate study on MTurk to replicate the main ﬁndings and mediation found in Experiment 3 . The results completely mirrored the results of Experiment 3 . Individuals who recalled expressing or receiving sarcasm engaged in more abstract thinking and were signiﬁcantly better at solving the Duncker Candle Problem than those who recalled a neutral conversation , F ( 2 , 63 ) = 3 . 61 , p = . 03 , g p2 = . 10 , and v 2 ( 2 , N = 66 ) = 8 . 96 , p = . 01 , u = . 37 . The effect of sarcasm on creativity was mediated by abstract thinking ( point estimate = . 70 ; 95 % bias - corrected conﬁ - dence interval of . 15 – 1 . 58 ) . 9 . Experiment 4 : How sarcasm can increase creativity without inﬂaming conﬂict Given the double - edged - sword nature of sarcasm and its wide use in organizational contexts , it is important to explore the condi - tions under which sarcasm could promote creative thinking with - out exacerbating conﬂict . As we have hypothesized , one possibility is that sarcasm is best used between organizational members who trust each other . This is because individuals’ trust in conversation partners leads recipients to interpret their partners’ behaviors pos - itively and expressers to expect positive interpretation of their behaviors ( Huang & Murnighan , 2010 ; McEvily et al . , 2003 ) . Therefore , when sarcasm expressers or recipients do not trust their conversation partners , expressing sarcasm toward or receiving sar - casm from them will increase a sense of conﬂict ( while still increasing creativity ) . However , when sarcasm expressers or recip - ients trust their conversation partners , expressing or receiving sar - casm will increase their creativity but will not increase their sense of conﬂict . Experiment 4 examines these predictions . 9 . 1 . Participants and design Two hundred and ﬁfty - eight Americans ( 131 males , 127 females ; age 19 – 75 , M = 35 . 12 , SD = 11 . 37 ) , recruited on MTurk for two and half dollars , were randomly assigned to a 2 ( trust vs . distrust ) by 5 ( expressing - sarcasm , receiving - sarcasm , expressing - sincerity , receiving - sincerity , or control condition ) design in a behavioral study . 9 . 2 . Procedure 9 . 2 . 1 . Trust manipulation In the trust conditions , participants recalled the person they trust the most , wrote down the person’s initials , brieﬂy described the person’s face , and explained why they trust this person . In the distrust conditions , participants went through the same process except that they recalled a person they distrust the most ( or trust the least ) . 9 . 2 . 2 . Sarcasm manipulation We manipulated expressing ( vs . receiving ) sarcasm ( vs . sincer - ity ) or neutral conversations using a simulated conversation task similar to the one used in Experiment 1 .

Speciﬁcally , for those in the distrust conditions , participants perceived signiﬁcantly more conﬂict in the expressing - sarcasm condition than in the expressing - sincerity , t ( 42 ) = 2 . 24 , p = . 03 , d = . 69 , receiving sincerity , t ( 42 ) = 1 . 97 , p = . 056 , d = . 61 , or control condition , t ( 43 ) = 2 . 20 , p = . 03 , d = . 67 .

Participants who had sarcastic conversations were signiﬁcantly more likely to solve the problem than those who had non - sarcastic conversations , B = 3 . 23 , SE = 1 . 08 , p = . 003 ( see Table 4 and Fig . 9 for percentages and pairwise comparisons ) , once again supporting Hypothesis 2 .

However , regardless of whether sarcasm expres - sers and recipients trusted or distrusted their conversation partners , they always beneﬁted from sarcasm’s creative effect , once again supporting Hypothesis 2 . 10 .

L . Huang et al . / Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes 131 ( 2015 ) 162 – 177 173 of the content of the sarcastic exchange . The effect on creativity travelled through abstract thinking for both sarcasm expressers and recipients . In contrast , sarcasm was not a reliable antecedent of positive mood , negative mood , or cognitive complexity . Sarcasm also increased feelings of interpersonal conﬂict . But , we found that trust was a critical moderator of the effect of sarcasm on conﬂict but not on creativity . 10 . 1 . Theoretical and practical implications The current research makes a number of contributions to the literature on creativity . First and foremost , it identiﬁes an impor - tant social psychological antecedent of creative behavior . Much management and psychology research has dedicated itself to the study of individual factors , such as personality , intelligence , educa - tion , and expertise ( e . g . , Amabile , 1988 ; Barron & Harrington , 1981 ; George & Zhou , 2001 ; Woodman , Sawyer , & Grifﬁn , 1993 ) . Recently , the two ﬁelds have started to devote considerable atten - tion to social and organizational factors that inﬂuence creativity through individuals’ cognition , emotion , and behavior ( e . g . , Amabile , Conti , Coon , Lazenby , & Herron , 1996 ; Maddux & Galinsky , 2009 ; Oldham & Cummings , 1996 ; Shalley & Perry - Smith , 2001 ) . One example is cognitive styles ( e . g . , Woodman et al . , 1993 ) , speciﬁcally abstract thinking ( e . g . , Finke , 1995 ; Ward et al . , 2004 ) . Our ﬁndings identify sarcasm as an ante - cedent of abstract thinking and add to this recent line of creativity research . Second , our research corroborates the increasingly robust rela - tionship between various forms of contradiction and creativity ( e . g . , Gino & Wiltermuth , 2014 ; Huang & Galinsky , 2011 ) . It demonstrates that sarcasm—expressions that intend to convey their true meaning by signifying the opposite of their literal mean - ing—affords creative beneﬁts . Third , our ﬁndings demonstrate that aggressive humor such as sarcasm , like other milder forms of humor , can also promote cre - ativity . Previous theorizing has focused almost exclusively on afﬁl - iative humor and its effect on creativity through mood ( e . g . , Isen et al . , 1987 ) . To build a complete theoretical map for the relation - ship between workplace humor and creativity , the ﬁeld needs to look at a wider palate of humor . Our ﬁndings address this theoret - ical gap , showing that , unlike the more afﬁliative humor , sarcasm promotes creativity through a cognitive route . The current research also contributes to the sarcasm literature . Our model goes beyond previous research and explicates sarcasm’s effect on creativity that generalizes across two important dimen - sions , role and content . First , our model demonstrates that the pos - itive effects of sarcasm on abstract thinking and creativity apply to both expressers and recipients . Previous research found that third - party observers of a sarcastic exchange that was also angry enjoyed enhanced creativity ( Miron - Spektor et al . , 2011 ) . Our research is the ﬁrst to demonstrate that being the actual partici - pants , not just the observers , of sarcastic exchanges has creative beneﬁts too . Second , our model demonstrates that the creative beneﬁts of sarcasm do not depend on the particular content of the sarcastic exchange . Instead , creativity seems enhanced follow - ing all types of sarcasm , from sarcastic anger and criticism to sar - castic compliments and banters . This demonstration is a fruitful step into the exploration of sarcasm’s conceptual boundary and its general effects . It suggests that sarcasm is best represented in its general form , i . e . , expressions ‘‘that communicate one’s mean - ing through language that signiﬁes the opposite ( e . g . , Pexman & Olineck , 2002 ) , instead of expressions that use ‘‘a literal positive meaning to communicate a negative message’’ ( Miron - Spektor et al . , 2011 ) . Our ﬁnding that trust reduces the sarcasm - conﬂict effect also sheds light on the relational function of sarcasm . While most psycholinguistic research has found sarcasm more contemptuous than sincerity ( e . g . , Kreuz et al . , 1991 ) , some ethnographic work has found it more polite and solidarity - enhancing among close others and within workgroups ( e . g . , Jorgensen , 1996 ; Seckman & Couch , 1989 ) . These seemingly contradictory ﬁndings may occur because this literature failed to consider the quality of relationship between expressers and recipients , speciﬁcally how much they trust each other . While sarcasm in a non - trusting relationship fuels conﬂict , sarcasm in a trusting - relationship is less harmful and may even bring individuals closer . Additionally , our research contributes to Construal Level Theory ( Trope & Liberman , 2010 ) . It identiﬁes sarcasm , a contradiction between stated and intended meanings , as a new form of psycho - logical distance and demonstrates that sarcasm expressers and recipients engage in abstract thinking because it is indispensable to the traversing of psychological distance . Finally , our work bears practical implications . Sarcasm is often used in exchange relationships and in organizations more broadly . It is generally considered detrimental to communication . A simple Internet search would generate copious advice from communica - tion coaches on how to eradicate sarcasm from the workplace . To avoid interpersonal friction and conﬂict , both teams and organiza - tions may be tempted to follow this advice . The current research suggests that , by doing so , organizations would ‘‘throw out the baby with the bath water’’ , jeopardizing the cognitive beneﬁts of sarcasm . 13 Our research offers a pragmatic way to beneﬁt from sarcasm without its relational costs . Expressing sarcasm with or receiving sarcasm from trusted others allows individuals to reap the beneﬁts of creativity without incurring conﬂict . This practice may prove especially rewarding in organizations where sarcasm is an inherent part of the job and building trust is equally critical but often neglected ( e . g . , comedy clubs ) . 10 . 2 . Limitations and directions for future research We note several limitations of the current work and identify fruitful directions for future research . First , although Experiment 3 found that both sarcasm expressers and recipients considered the sarcasm humorous , Experiment 1 found that sarcasm expres - sers were more amused than recipients . This suggests that while both expressers and recipients of sarcasm enjoy abstract thinking as a common cognitive process , they might differ on other aspects of their experiences such as humor appreciation , especially since neuropsychology research suggests that cognitive processes are not sufﬁcient for humor appreciation , a process that requires an integration of cognitive and affective processes ( Shammi & Stuss , 1999 ) . Neuroimaging results indicate that while left inferior frontal and posterior temporal cortices are responsible for the cognitive process of humor detection , bilateral regions of insular cortex and the amygdala are responsible for the affective experience of mirth and , as a result , humor appreciation ( Moran , Wig , Adams , Janata , & Kelley , 2004 ) . Future research could shed more light on when sarcasm expressers and recipients experience different levels of activity in the latter brain regions and enjoy sarcasm to a differ - ent degree . It may help build a more integrated theoretical frame - work for understanding when sarcasm expressers enjoy creative beneﬁts through both a cognitive and an affective route ; in con - trast , we expect that recipients depend solely on the cognitive channel to deliver sarcasm’s creative beneﬁts . 13 A few sarcastic remarks or even recalling the experience of sarcasm in the past can have medium and occasionally large effects on creativity ( u s = . 29 – . 49 ; Cohen’s d s = . 64 – 1 . 00 ) ; these effect sizes are comparable to the effect sizes of afﬁliative humor ( u s = . 50 – . 55 ; d s = . 46 – . 91 ; Isen et al . , 1987 ; Ziv , 1976 , 1983 ) , education ( d s = . 43 – . 87 ; Perry - Smith , 2006 ; Tierney , Farmer , & Graen , 1999 ) , and expertise ( d s = 43 – . 82 ; Perry - Smith , 2006 ; Tierney et al . , 1999 ) . 174 L . Huang et al . / Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes 131 ( 2015 ) 162 – 177 Similarly , although Experiments 1 and 2 did not ﬁnd an effect of sarcastic experience on mood , Experiment 3 found that sarcasm recipients experienced both more positive and negative moods compared to the other conditions . Given this inconsistency across studies , future research is also needed to understand the complex relationship between sarcasm and mood . Finally , abstract thinking has been shown to predict a variety of social and organizational outcomes , including psychological power , moral outrage , group identiﬁcation , and stereotyping ( Gong & Medin , 2012 ; McCrea , Wieber , & Myers , 2012 ; Smith , Wigboldus , & Dijksterhuis , 2008 ) . Given that we have shown that sarcasm is a reliable antecedent of abstract thinking , future research should investigate other potential social and organiza - tional effects of sarcasm through abstraction , beyond just creativity . 11 . Conclusion The current research establishes sarcasm as a double - edged sword : it helps people think creatively even as they seethe in con - ﬂict . We have also shown that abstract thinking is the driving force that connects sarcasm to creativity and that sarcastic exchanges in trusting relationships boost creativity without incurring conﬂict . As Oscar Wilde believed , sarcasm , at times , represents a lower form of humanity , but it certainly catalyzes a higher form of thought .
