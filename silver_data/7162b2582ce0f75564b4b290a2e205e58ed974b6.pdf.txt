Here we intro - duce Juicebox , a tool for exploring Hi - C and other contact map data . Juicebox allows users to zoom in and out of Hi - C maps interactively , just as a user of Google Earth might zoom in and out of a geographic map . Maps can be compared to one another , or to 1D tracks or 2D feature sets . Hi - C is a widely employed method for studying how genomes are folded in three dimensions ( Rao et al . , 2014 ) . In Hi - C , DNA loci that are spatially proximate in a system of interest ( such as a cell nucleus or an in vitro DNA preparation ) are ligated to one another and sequenced . This results in a Hi - C contact map : a list of pairs of genomic positions that were adja - cent to each other in three - dimensional ( 3D ) space . Typically , the pairwise interactions produced by Hi - C experiments are visualized as a heatmap : the linear genome is partitioned into loci of a ﬁxed size , or resolution ( e . g . , 1 Mb or 1 kb ) , and each entry in the two - dimensional ( 2D ) heatmap corresponds to the number of contacts observed between a pair of loci dur - ing the experiment . Developing adequate visualizations for Hi - C heatmaps is a challenge , because the size of the meaningful biological features they contain ranges over at least seven orders of magnitude : from loops anchored at 20 - bp CTCF sites to territories that extend across 200 - Mb chromosomes . At the highest meaningful resolutions , published Hi - C heatmaps contain trillions of entries , and only a tiny portion can be displayed at any given time . At coarser resolutions , more of the map can be shown , but the ﬁne structure can no longer be resolved . Several Hi - C visualization systems exist . Like a paper atlas , these browsers show the map at a single resolution ( typically either 1 Mb or 100 kb ) , either in its entirety ( Servant et al . , 2012 ; Paulsen et al . , 2014 ; Lieberman - Aiden et al . , 2009 ) or very close to the diagonal ( Zhou et al . , 2013 ) . Users cannot zoom in and out in real time . Also , most of these systems are designed to show speciﬁc , previously published datasets , and they do not allow users to visualize their own experiments . Here we introduce Juicebox , a tool for exploring Hi - C data and contact maps in general ( Figure 1 ) . Juicebox allows users to explore Hi - C heatmaps interactively , zooming in and out just as a user of Google Earth might zoom in and out of a geographic map ; it integrates many technologies developed for the Integrative Genomics Viewer ( Robinson et al . , 2011 ) with a broad ensemble of methods speciﬁcally designed for handling 2D contact data . Individual maps can be normalized ( corrected for experimental bias ) , compared to one - dimen - sional ( 1D ) tracks ( such as gene tracks or chromatin immuno - precipitation sequencing [ ChIP - seq ] data ) , and compared to 2D feature lists ( such as loop and domain annotations ) . Multi - ple maps can be browsed side by side simultaneously and compared with one another in various ways , revealing both conservation and variation across cell types and species . Users can create their own heatmaps to explore their own ex - periments ( Durand et al . , 2016 ) . Juicebox was an invaluable tool in making biological discoveries across many size scales in our group’s recent paper ( Rao et al . , 2014 ) . In Juicebox—when using Hi - C maps of adequate depth and quality—increasingly small features can be resolved as the user zooms in . In a genome - wide view , chromosome territories are evident , as are chromosomal rearrangements such as trans - locations . Clicking on a particular chromosome zooms into its intrachromosomal map , optimized for the user’s monitor . The broad compartmentalization of the genome , which manifests as alternating long - range patterns , is typically visible at this resolution . On the X chromosome , two superdomains also may become apparent , partitioning the chromosome . These are accompanied by superloops , bright peaks many megabases away from the diagonal . Zooming in further can be accomplished by double - clicking , by using the resolution slider , or by drawing a box around a re - gion of interest . At 50 - kb resolution , subcompartments can be seen , reﬂecting ﬁner differences in the long - range contact pattern . At 25 - kb resolution , contact domains appear : these are intervals containing loci , which preferentially form contacts with one another and that form squares along the diagonal . Juicebox makes it easy to compare these structures to a large Cell Systems 3 , 99 – 101 , July 27 , 2016 ª 2016 Elsevier Inc . 99 number of broad - source chromatin marks at once . We ﬁnd that the epigenetic marks that decorate particular contact domains correlate strongly with differences in long - range contact pattern . At 5 - kb resolution , chromatin loops are readily seen as bright peaks in which contact frequency is enhanced relative to the local neighborhood . These tend to lie at the corners of contact domains . Finally , at 1 kb , the relationship between the loops and point - source epigenetic tracks can be interrogated . For instance , it becomes clear the chromatin loops are frequently anchored at convergent CTCF motifs , i . e . , CTCF motifs that point toward one another ( Rao et al . , 2014 ) . Juicebox can be used to zoom in much further , although maps with enough data to support such studies do not yet exist . Juicebox is available as a Java application that can be down - loaded and launched via aidenlab . org / juicebox . The code is open source and licensed under the MIT license , available at https : / / github . com / theaidenlab / Juicebox . Userscanexploretheir own data or examine data from over 15 Hi - C , 5C , and CHIA - PET publications . We also provide the software and test datasets used to review this manuscript at http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 17632 / dj4nrsc552 . 1 . We hope that allowing researchers to zoom inward will help studies of chromatin architecture to zoom onward . Figure 1 . Juicebox Enables Exploration of Contact Maps at Many Resolutions A screenshot of Juicebox zoomed in to 5 - kb resolution on chromosome 3 . The toolbar at the top allows users to quickly navigate between different chromo - somes , views , normalizations , and resolutions . Users can load one - dimensional tracks and compare them to features seen in the heatmap . Two - dimensional features can be superimposed on the main map . Severalpeaks are annotated ( cyan ) , each peak indicating the presence of achromatin loop . A peak inthe CTCF track , indicating CTCF binding , is seen at most loop anchors . At the top right , a mini - map shows the whole chromosome at low resolution . Below , hover text shows additional data for one of the highlighted peaks . 100 Cell Systems 3 , 99 – 101 , July 27 , 2016 AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS E . L . A . conceived of this project . J . T .
