While barbed ends are considered the hotspot of actin assembly [ 4 ] , disassembly is thought 13 to primarily occur via reactions on filament sides and pointed ends [ 3 , 5 - 11 ] . Cyclase - associated 14 protein ( CAP ) has emerged as the main protagonist of actin disassembly and remodeling – it 15 collaborates with cofilin to increase pointed - end depolymerization by 300 - fold [ 6 , 7 ] , promotes 16 filament “coalescence” in presence of Abp1 [ 12 ] , and accelerates nucleotide exchange to 17 regenerate monomers for new rounds of assembly [ 13 - 15 ] . CAP has also been reported to 18 enhance cofilin - mediated severing [ 16 , 17 ] , but these claims have since been challenged [ 7 ] . 19 Using microfluidics - assisted three - color single - molecule imaging , we now reveal that CAP also 20 has important functions at filament barbed ends . We reveal that CAP is a processive barbed - end 21 depolymerase capable of tracking both ends of the filament . Each CAP binding event leads to 22 removal of about 5 , 175 and 620 subunits from the barbed and pointed ends respectively . We find 23 that the WH2 domain is essential , and the CARP domain is dispensable for barbed - end 24 depolymerization . We show that CAP co - localizes with barbed - end bound formin and capping 25 protein , in the process increasing residence time of formin by 10 - fold and promoting dissociation 26 of CP by 4 - fold . Our barbed - end observations combined with previously reported activities of CAP 27 at pointed ends and sides , firmly establish CAP as a key player in actin dynamics . 28 3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 29 CAP is a barbed - end depolymerase 30 We employed microfluidics - assisted total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy ( mf - TIRF ) 31 to investigate effects of mouse CAP1 ( referred to as CAP henceforth ) on barbed - end 32 depolymerization . Actin filaments with free barbed ends were elongated from coverslip - anchored 33 spectrin - actin seeds by flowing in a solution containing Alexa - 488 labelled G - actin and unlabeled 34 profilin ( profilin - actin ) ( Fig . 1A ) . The filaments were aged for 15 minutes to allow P i release and 35 conversion to ADP - F - actin following which they were exposed to TIRF buffer in absence or 36 presence of CAP . While control filaments depolymerized at 9 . 7±1 . 3 subunits / s ( su / s hereafter ) 37 ( ± sd ) , addition of 1 µM CAP caused a 4 - fold increase in depolymerization rate ( 38 . 2 ± 5 . 2 su / s ) 38 ( Fig . 1C – E ) . Acceleration of barbed - end depolymerization by CAP is consistent with results from 39 a recent study from the Goode lab [ 18 ] . Our observation of barbed - end depolymerization together 40 with previous reports of 4 - fold acceleration of depolymerization at pointed - ends [ 6 , 13 ] establish 41 CAP as a bona - fide depolymerase of both ends of actin filaments . 42 Barbed - end depolymerization mediated by C - terminal half of CAP 43 CAP is a modular protein whose N - terminal ( N - CAP ) and C - terminal ( C - CAP ) halves function 44 autonomously in actin disassembly and monomer recycling ( Fig . 1B ) [ 19 - 21 ] . N - CAP consists of 45 an oligomerization domain ( OD ) , a helical - folded domain ( HFD ) , and promotes pointed - end 46 depolymerization [ 6 , 7 ] . N - CAP has also been reported to bind filament sides and enhance cofilin - 47 mediated severing [ 16 , 17 ] . However , these conclusions have been challenged by a recent 48 structural study which implied that actin - binding HFD domains of N - CAP could only be docked at 49 the filament pointed end [ 7 ] . Consistently , the authors observed no enhancement of cofilin - 50 mediated severing by N - CAP . C - terminal half of CAP or C - CAP consists of WH2 domain [ 22 ] , 51 CARP domain and polyproline motifs . WH2 and CARP domains bind G - actin , accelerate 52 nucleotide exchange ( from ADP to ATP ) to regenerate ATP - actin monomers for new rounds of 53 polymerization [ 13 - 15 ] . Lastly , while N - CAP monomers oligomerize into tetramers [ 23 , 24 ] and / or 54 hexamers [ 16 , 17 ] , C - CAP monomers self - assemble into dimers [ 15 , 25 ] . 55 4 56 Fig . 1 : Mouse CAP1 accelerates actin filament barbed - end depolymerization . ( A ) 57 Schematic representation of the experimental strategy . Actin filaments with free barbed 58 ends were polymerized by exposing coverslip - anchored spectrin - actin seeds to 1 µM G - 59 actin ( 15 % Alexa - 488 labeled ) and 4 µM profilin . The filaments were then aged for 15 60 minutes and then exposed to 1 µM CAP ( full length , N - CAP or C - CAP ) or control buffer . 61 Barbed - end depolymerization was monitored over time .

Number of filaments analyzed for 79 each condition ( left to right ) : 25 , 29 , 20 and 20 . 80 In light of previously reported depolymerization function of N - CAP , we wondered if it might also 81 be responsible for barbed - end depolymerization by CAP . Free barbed ends of ADP - actin 82 filaments were exposed to a solution containing either N - CAP or C - CAP . While N - CAP had no 83 effect on barbed - ends , C - CAP accelerated their depolymerization by about 4 - fold , similar to full - 84 length CAP ( Fig . 1E ) . Thus , the depolymerization action of CAP at the two ends is facilitated by 85 its distinct halves i . e . , N - CAP at the pointed and C - CAP at the barbed end . Additional analysis 86 showed that C - CAP promotes depolymerization in a concentration - dependent fashion ( Fig . 1F ) . 87 At saturation , a maximal depolymerization rate of about 58 su / s , approximately 6 - fold higher than 88 control , was observed . These kinetics suggest that at lower C - CAP concentrations , binding of C - 89 CAP to actin filaments might be rate - limiting . 90 Effects of filament age , cofilin and polymerizable G - actin 91 While actin networks in vivo can turn over in just a few seconds [ 26 - 29 ] , depolymerization in vitro 92 is orders of magnitude slower , mainly due to slow P i release [ 30 , 31 ] . We therefore wondered if 93 C - CAP might also depolymerize unaged filaments . To prevent aging , actin filaments were 94 maintained in TIRF buffer containing 50 mM P i , as done previously [ 32 ] . We found that C - CAP 95 6 also accelerated barbed - end depolymerization of ADP - P i filaments ( Fig . 1G ) . Notably , although 96 average depolymerization rate of ADP - P i filaments by C - CAP was 10 - fold lower than that of ADP 97 filaments ( ~ 6 vs ~ 60 su / s ) , the fold - increase over control was almost double for ADP - P i than ADP 98 filaments ( 12 - fold vs 6 - fold ) . Thus , C - CAP is capable of accelerating depolymerization of both 99 aged and newly - assembled actin filaments . 100 While our experiments thus far were conducted in absence of G - actin , cytosol contains high 101 amounts of assembly - competent actin monomers , majority of which are bound to profilin [ 2 , 33 , 102 34 ] . We therefore investigated how presence of profilin - actin monomers affected 103 depolymerization by C - CAP . In the presence of 1 µM profilin - actin , filament barbed ends 104 elongated at 8 . 6 ± 0 . 5 su / s ( Fig . 1H ) . Further addition of C - CAP significantly altered this behavior . 105 While low concentrations of C - CAP slowed net polymerization , higher concentrations induced net 106 depolymerization . Addition of 1 µM profilin - actin to reactions containing 5 µM C - CAP led to a 30 % 107 reduction in net depolymerization rate from 57 . 7 ± 3 . 9 su / s to 41 . 8 ± 8 . 9 su / s . It is unclear whether 108 this reduction results from sequestration of actin monomers by C - CAP or due to C - CAP’s barbed 109 end interaction . Notably , a known barbed - end depolymerase , twinfilin , also shows a similar 110 behavior , both in absence ( for ADP - P i filaments ) and presence of polymerizable actin monomers 111 [ 32 ] . 112 We then asked if C - CAP , like N - CAP , might also synergize with cofilin [ 6 , 7 ] . Supplementing C - 113 CAP only reactions with cofilin ( human Cofilin - 1 ) almost completely extinguished barbed end 114 depolymerization ( Fig . 1I ) , leading to rates only slightly higher than cofilin - only reactions . Indeed , 115 a previous study reported that cofilin’s saturation of filament sides drastically reduces barbed - end 116 depolymerization [ 35 ] . Our data suggests that C - CAP is not able to catalyze disassembly of 117 cofilin - coated filaments . Cofilin thus has opposing effects on CAP’s depolymerization abilities at 118 the two ends of actin filaments . 119 Barbed - end depolymerization by CAP is conserved and requires WH2 domains 120 CAP is a highly conserved protein expressed across fungus , plants and vertebrates [ 3 ] . We 121 therefore asked if barbed - end depolymerization by CAP was conserved . Similar to the 122 mammalian homolog , the C - terminal half of S . cerevisiae Srv2 ( C - Srv2 ) also accelerated 123 depolymerization . Notwithstanding the qualitative similarity , even at high concentration ( ~ 5 µM ) 124 C - Srv2 only caused a 1 . 8 - fold increase in depolymerization as compared to the 6 - fold increase 125 by C - CAP ( Fig . 2A - C ) . Like N - CAP , N - Srv2 had no impact on barbed end depolymerization . Thus , 126 combined with our previous pointed - end studies [ 6 ] , our results here show that Srv2 / CAP’s 127 7 promotion of depolymerization at both filament ends is conserved between budding yeast and 128 human homologs . 129 We then sought to determine which of the two actin - binding domains in the C - terminal half i . e . , 130 WH2 or CARP , caused barbed - end depolymerization . We expressed and purified Srv2ΔCARP 131 ( Fig . 2A ) , a new construct which contained the WH2 domain but not the CARP domain . In contrast 132 with a recent study [ 18 ] , we found that absence of CARP domain did not abolish barbed - end 133 depolymerization ( Fig . 2C ) . Instead , we observed that Srv2ΔCARP and C - Srv2 promoted barbed 134 end depolymerization equally well . Since the only actin binding motif common between the two 135 constructs is the WH2 domain , our results imply that the WH2 domain is necessary , and CARP 136 is dispensable for barbed - end depolymerization by Srv2 / CAP . 137 Srv2 / CAP molecules processively track depolymerizing barbed ends 138 To further reveal the molecular mechanism by which Srv2 / CAP induces barbed - end 139 depolymerization , we directly visualized Cy5 - labelled Srv2ΔCARP on actin filaments using 140 single - molecule imaging . We decided to use Srv2ΔCARP for single molecule experiments as 141 Srv2ΔCARP ( monomers ) contains only a single cysteine which can be fluorescently labelled in a 142 residue - specific manner ( Fig . 2C ) . In contrast , while CAP , C - CAP , and CAP1ΔCARP monomers 143 contain six , four and two , cysteines ; Srv2 and C - Srv2 monomers contain 4 and 3 cysteines 144 respectively . In addition , we have previously successfully used Cy5 - Srv2ΔCARP to visualize 145 Srv2 / CAP molecules on pointed - ends of cofilin - decorated filaments [ 6 ] . 146 Free barbed ends of ADP - actin filaments were first transiently exposed to a flow containing Cy5 - 147 Srv2ΔCARP ( 100 nM monomers ) in the mf - TIRF chamber , followed by continuous exposure to 148 TIRF buffer ( Fig . 2D ) . We observed that Cy5 - Srv2ΔCARP molecules associated directly with actin 149 filament barbed ends . All ends depolymerizing with a detectable Cy5 signal underwent rapid 150 depolymerization . Consistently , the absence of Cy5 signal at the barbed end was accompanied 151 by slow depolymerization and arrival of Cy5 signal was accompanied by initiation of rapid 152 depolymerization ( Fig . 2F , G ) . The depolymerization rate of Cy5 - Srv2ΔCARP - bound barbed ends 153 was similar to maximal depolymerization seen at saturating concentrations of unlabeled 154 Srv2ΔCARP ( Fig . 2C ) , suggesting that at saturating Srv2ΔCARP , the filament end is almost 155 continuously occupied by a Srv2ΔCARP molecule . Each Cy5 - Srv2ΔCARP binding event on 156 average lasted 226 ± 54 seconds ( Fig . 2H ) and barbed ends with a visible Cy5 signal 157 depolymerized at 22 . 9 ± 4 . 6 su / s ( Fig . 2G , H ) . Product of these two values yields the average 158 number of subunits removed per Srv2ΔCARP binding event , 5 , 175 ± 1 , 615 subunits . 159 8 160 Fig . 2 : Srv2 / CAP is an evolutionary conserved processive depolymerase of both ends 161 of actin filaments .

So far , S . cerevisiae twinfilin is the only other protein reported to processively 185 depolymerize barbed ends [ 36 ] . Twinfilin’s processive behavior has however been challenged in 186 light of recent structural insights which implied that a twinfilin molecule might instead only cause 187 dissociation of terminal actin subunits at the barbed end [ 37 ] . 188 Srv2 / CAP molecules processively track depolymerizing pointed ends 189 Two previous studies directly visualized fluorescently labelled Srv2 / CAP molecules associating 190 with pointed ends of cofilin - coated filaments [ 6 , 7 ] . However , due to the transient nature of 191 Srv2 / CAP associations ( ~ 2 seconds ) with pointed ends of cofilin - actin filaments , it was not 192 possible to ascertain whether Srv2 / CAP molecules translocated with depolymerizing pointed ends 193 i . e . , were processive . To address this question , we performed single - molecule imaging using Cy5 - 194 Srv2ΔCARP . Preformed fluorescent ADP - actin filaments were captured by coverslip - anchored 195 10 capping protein in a mf - TIRF chamber . Upon a transient exposure to Cy5 - Srv2ΔCARP ( 100 nM ) , 196 filaments were exposed continuously to TIRF buffer ( Fig . 2E ) . We observed Cy5 - Srv2ΔCARP 197 associating with filament pointed ends . All ends with a detectable Cy5 signal underwent rapid 198 depolymerization ( Fig . 2I , J ) . Appearance of Cy5 - Srv2ΔCARP signal was accompanied by 199 beginning of rapid depolymerization . Consistently , the disappearance of Cy5 - Srv2ΔCARP was 200 accompanied by resumption of slow depolymerization characteristic of free pointed ends 201 depolymerizing in buffer ( Fig . 2I ) . Each binding event on average lasted 620 ± 30 seconds ( Fig . 202 2K , L ) . Pointed - ends with Cy5 signal depolymerized at 1 . 2 ± 0 . 2 su / s ( Fig . 2J , K ) , about 6 - fold 203 faster than filaments without a visible Cy5 signal . Product of these two values yields the average 204 number of subunits removed per Srv2ΔCARP binding event , 743 ± 130 subunits . Our data thus 205 supports the view that Srv2 / CAP is a processive depolymerase of both ends of actin filaments . 206 Srv2 / CAP associates with formin - bound barbed ends and slows formin’s dissociation 207 without affecting elongation rate 208 In light of direct binding of Srv2 / CAP to barbed ends , we asked if Srv2 / CAP might also associate 209 with barbed ends bound to other ligands such as formin and capping protein , which either 210 accelerate or arrest barbed assembly . We first studied formin . SNAP - tagged formin mDia1 ( FH1 - 211 FH2 - C ) was expressed and labeled with benzylguanine functionalized fluorescent dye ( 649 - 212 mDia1 ) . SNAP - tagging and labelling did not alter dimerization or actin assembly properties of 213 formin , as seen previously [ 38 - 41 ] . 214 Alexa - 488 labeled actin filaments with free barbed ends were transiently exposed to either 649 - 215 mDia1 alone or together with Cy5 - Srv2ΔCARP , followed by a solution containing profilin - actin 216 ( Fig . 3A ) . In absence of Cy5 - Srv2ΔCARP , the majority of filaments only displayed 649 - mDia1 at 217 their barbed end ( Fig . 3B ) . When 649 - mDia1 and Cy5 - Srv2ΔCARP were simultaneously present , 218 two distinct barbed - end populations were seen : 1 ) bound only to 649 - mDia1 2 ) bound to both 219 649 - mDia1 and Cy5 - Srv2ΔCARP with the two molecules together tracking the elongating end 220 ( Fig . 3C ) . Importantly , the barbed - end elongation rate remained unchanged independent of 221 whether formin was bound alone to barbed ends or together with Cy5 - Srv2ΔCARP ( Fig . 3D ) . 222 11 223 12 Fig . 3 : Srv2 / CAP stabilizes barbed - end binding of formin ( A ) Schematic representation 224 of the experimental strategy . Actin filaments with free barbed ends were assembled similarly 225 as in Fig . 1A and exposed to either 649 - mDia1 alone or together with Cy3 - Srv2ΔCARP , 226 and then exposed to 1 µM Alexa - 488 G - actin and 4 µM profilin .

Number of filaments analyzed 233 for each condition : 20 . ( E ) Schematic representation of the experimental strategy . Actin 234 filaments were nucleated from coverslip - anchored formins by introducing a flow containing 235 1 µM G - actin ( 15 % Alexa - 488 labeled ) and 0 . 5 µM profilin . The filaments were then allowed 236 to elongate in presence of 1 µM unlabeled G - actin and 4 µM profilin to ensure insertional 237 elongation between fluorescent fragment and surface - anchored formins . These filaments 238 were then exposed to a flow containing C - CAP in absence of profilin - actin . The survival 239 fraction of filaments attached to formins was monitored as a function of time . Blue colored 240 C - CAP molecules represent unlabeled protein . ( F ) Representative kymograph of a formin - 241 anchored filament elongating from unlabeled monomers ( see Fig . 3D ) and then being 242 exposed to buffer .

Experimental data ( symbols ) are fitted to a single - exponential function ( lines ) to 245 determine formin dissociation rate . Number of filaments analyzed for each condition ( from 246 low to high C - CAP concentration ) : 90 , 62 , 80 , 68 , 46 ) ( H ) Formin dissociation rate as a 247 function of C - CAP concentration , determined from data shown in ( G ) . 248 We then asked if Srv2 / CAP altered barbed - end processivity of formin . Since processivity is 249 influenced by actin labelling fraction , elongation rate and presence of profilin [ 42 ] , we employed 250 an alternative strategy in ( absence of profilin and G - actin ) which we and others have previously 251 used to study processivity of formin ( Fig 3E ) [ 38 , 40 , 42 ] . Actin filaments were nucleated by 252 exposing coverslip - anchored formins to a solution containing fluorescent actin monomers and 253 profilin ( Fig . 3E ) . To ensure that insertional polymerization was occurring at anchored formins , a 254 solution containing profilin and unlabeled actin monomers was introduced . As a result , fluorescent 255 segments appeared to move along the flow as filaments elongated ( Fig , 3E , F ) . These actin 256 13 filaments were then exposed to a solution containing a range of C - CAP concentrations ( in 257 absence of profilin - actin ) . The time - dependent disappearance of filaments from the field of view 258 ( due to their dissociation from surface - anchored formins ) was analyzed to determine formin’s 259 dissociation rate from barbed ends . We found that formins remained bound to filaments for longer 260 durations in the presence of C - CAP ( Fig . 3F ) . Formin’s dissociation rate decreased with 261 increasing C - CAP concentration . At saturating C - CAP concentration , we observed a 10 - fold 262 increase in barbed end processivity of formin ( Fig . 3G ) . Consistent with single - molecule analysis , 263 C - CAP did not alter the depolymerization rate of formin - bound barbed ends . Together , our data 264 suggests that while C - CAP stabilizes formin’s association at barbed ends , it does not alter formin’s 265 effects on the polymerization / depolymerization rate . 266 Srv2 / CAP colocalizes with CP at barbed ends and accelerates uncapping 267 We then sought to investigate if CAP might also alter CP’s barbed - end binding . A SNAP - tagged 268 construct of mouse capping protein ( SNAP - CP ) was expressed and labeled with benzylguanine 269 functionalized green - excitable ( 549 - CP ) fluorescent dye . As seen previously , SNAP - tagging and 270 labelling did not alter CP’s interactions with the barbed - end [ 40 , 41 ] . Alexa - 488 labeled actin 271 filaments with free barbed ends were transiently exposed to 549 - CP in presence of profilin and 272 G - actin ( Fig . 4A ) . Appearance of a 549 - CP signal at barbed ends coincided with filaments 273 switching from elongating to paused state . Upon subsequent exposure to a solution containing 274 Cy5 - Srv2ΔCARP and profilin - actin , we observed that Srv2ΔCARP colocalized with 549 - CP at 275 barbed ends ( Fig . 4B ) . During co - localization , filaments remained paused ; no change in filament 276 length was observed . We then asked if Srv2 / CAP might influence barbed - end residence of CP ? 277 We employed a strategy similar to one used for investigating formins’ processivity . Preformed 278 fluorescently - labeled actin filaments were captured by coverslip - anchored CP in the mf - TIRF 279 chamber ( Fig . 4C ) . Time - dependent disappearance of filaments from the field of view was 280 recorded and used to determine the uncapping rate . In presence of C - CAP , the uncapping rate 281 increased linearly with C - CAP concentration ( Fig D - G ) . Notably , although we only observed a 282 maximum of 4 - fold enhancement in CP’s dissociation rate from the barbed end , given the linear 283 nature of concentration - dependence we expect further enhancement at higher C - CAP 284 concentrations . Our results add CAP to the list of proteins with uncapping abilities namely formin 285 [ 38 ] , CARMIL [ 43 ] , twinfilin [ 44 ] , cofilin [ 35 ] , VopF [ 45 ] . 286 14 287 Fig . 4 : Srv2 / CAP co - localizes with CP at barbed ends and promotes uncapping .

( G ) 303 CP dissociation rate as a function of C - CAP concentration , determined from data shown in 304 ( F ) . 305 Role of WH2 domains in barbed end effects of CAP 306 WH2 domains have primarily been considered as actin monomer - binding motifs which promote 307 nucleation [ 22 , 46 ] . WH2 - containing nucleators include SPIRE [ 47 ] , Cordon Bleu [ 48 ] , Leiomodin 308 [ 49 ] , VopF / VopL [ 50 , 51 ] , and Sca2 [ 52 , 53 ] . WH2 binding to barbed ends is considered less 309 favorable due to the flatter F - actin conformation . How then might WH2 domain of CAP interact 310 with the barbed end ? There are two possible lines of reasoning . First , although the WH2 - binding 311 site is largely obscured on subunits in the filament , the binding site is fully exposed at the barbed 312 end [ 46 ] . Second , a high - resolution barbed - end structure recently published in a landmark study 313 by the Dominguez lab showed that the W loop and the C - terminus of terminal actin’s hydrophobic 314 cleft undergoes a G - actin - like conformation at the barbed end [ 54 ] . These conformational changes 315 likely play a role in barbed - end effects of WH2 - containing proteins like CAP , N - WASP [ 55 ] , WASP 316 [ 56 ] and VopF [ 45 ] . To our knowledge , ours is the first report of WH2 domains facilitating 317 processive barbed - end depolymerization . 318 In addition to binding free barbed and pointed ends , we find that CAP can also bind formin - bound 319 and CP - bound barbed ends . Co - localization of CAP with either of these two proteins does not 320 alter their respective individual effects on barbed - end elongation . Similar observations were 321 previously made for budding yeast twinfilin i . e . , presence of yeast Srv2 increased the processivity 322 but not barbed - end depolymerization rate of twinfilin [ 36 ] . Interestingly , the increase in 323 processivity of twinfilin was mediated by the N - terminal half of Srv2 and not the C - terminal half ! 324 Thus , CAP alters barbed - end residence time of elongators ( formin ) , blockers ( capping protein ) 325 16 and depolymerases ( twinfilin ) . In future , it will be interesting to investigate if CAP might also co - 326 localize with formin - CP - twinfilin complex and influence the dynamics of this multiprotein barbed - 327 end complex [ 40 ] . 328 We believe our results bring new insights into how multiple proteins might co - exist at the barbed 329 end . CP binds the barbed end primarily via interactions of its β - and α - tentacle with hydrophobic 330 cleft of the terminal and penultimate actin subunits [ 54 , 57 , 58 ] . WH2 domains also target the 331 same hydrophobic cleft on actin [ 59 ] . Deletion of β - tentacle “only” weakens barbed - end affinity of 332 CP by 300 - fold in comparison to 5000 - fold weakening in absence of α - tentacle [ 58 ] . We speculate 333 that destabilization of CP by CAP is primarily caused by a competition between the β - tentacle and 334 the WH2 domain as reported recently [ 59 ] . This is likely further aided by splaying of the barbed - 335 end subunits due to CP binding [ 54 ] . We believe these structural observations open the possibility 336 for a plausible mechanism for destabilization of CP by WH2 domains , and allowing for faster 337 uncapping by CAP . Another WH2 domain protein VopF has also been previously reported to 338 displace CP from barbed ends [ 45 ] . 339 While our manuscript was under preparation , we became aware of another study with results that 340 partially overlap with our findings [ 18 ] . Although effects of CAP on barbed end depolymerization 341 are qualitatively consistent between the studies , ADP - actin depolymerization rates were 4 - fold 342 faster rate in our study ( ~ 58 su / s vs 15 su / s ) . We believe this disparity originates from differences 343 in the filament aging process . While we aged filaments for 15 minutes after polymerization to 344 explicitly convert them to ADP - actin , filaments in the other study were immediately exposed to 345 CAP following their polymerization to mimic in vivo conditions . As a result , the filaments likely 346 contained a mix of ADP and ADP - P i subunits . Further , Alimov et al also report that CARP domains 347 are required for barbed - end depolymerization . They found that a modified C - CAP construct 348 consisting of poly - proline regions , WH2 motif and a GST tag but not the CARP domain failed to 349 promote depolymerization . In contrast , we found that Srv2ΔCARP which contained the WH2 350 domain but lacked the CARP domain depolymerized barbed ends as fast as C - Srv2 which 351 contained both WH2 and CARP . Additionally , the authors found that C - CAP promotes dissociation 352 of formin from barbed ends . In contrast , we observe that C - CAP increased barbed - end residence 353 time of formin by 4 - fold . We further note that co - localization with CAP did not change the 354 elongation rate of formin in our experiments . 355 356 17 Concluding remarks and cellular implications 357 Combining our observations with previously known activities of CAP , it depolymerizes barbed 358 ends , accelerates cofilin - mediated pointed end depolymerization [ 6 , 7 ] , uncaps CP , stabilizes 359 barbed - end binding of formin and twinfilin [ 36 ] , collaborates with Abp1 to bundle filaments [ 12 ] , 360 and promotes nucleotide exchange [ 13 - 15 ] . In addition , a complex of lysine - acetylated actin and 361 CAP regulates autoinhibition of formin INF2 [ 60 ] . In light of the wide diversity of effects CAP exerts 362 on actin dynamics directly and via other proteins , it would not be an exaggeration to call CAP the 363 “swiss army knife” of actin dynamics ! 364 The phenomenon of actin “treadmilling” has formed the central bedrock of our understanding of 365 actin dynamics for over three decades [ 1 , 28 ] . “Treadmilling” entails actin filaments polymerizing 366 at their barbed ends and depolymerizing from their pointed ends . Our discovery of barbed - end 367 depolymerization by CAP together with previously reported barbed - end effects of twinfilin [ 32 , 36 ] 368 and pointed - end polymerization by VopF [ 61 ] further challenge the universality of actin 369 “treadmilling” . 370 Although actin regulatory proteins have classically been studied one at a time , we now understand 371 that in cells , they act simultaneously in multiprotein teams , often at the same site on a filament . 372 Our results shed light on novel multicomponent activities of CAP at the barbed end i . e . , promoting 373 uncapping and stabilizing formin . It was previously shown that when present alone , CP promotes 374 displacement of formin from the barbed end [ 38 , 41 ] . However , addition of the uncapper twinfilin 375 promoted formin - mediated actin assembly [ 40 ] . Since CAP increases twinfilin’s processivity [ 36 ] 376 and uncaps CP [ 44 ] , we speculate that in the complex intracellular milieu , CAP and twinfilin might 377 together act as a highly potent uncapper and in turn promote formin - mediated assembly . 378 Nevertheless , we are fully aware that future cellular studies are needed to test the physiological 379 relevance of in vitro mechanisms and predictions reported here . We also believe that future Cryo - 380 EM structural studies will be key to gaining deeper mechanistic insights on how CAP interacts 381 with barbed ends , alone and together with formin and CP . 382 18 Acknowledgements 383 We are grateful to Pekka Lappalainen for generously sharing CAP plasmids .

The supernatant was 475 then incubated with 1 mL of Ni - NTA beads ( Qiagen , USA ) while rotating for 2 h at 4°C . The beads 476 were then washed three times with the wash buffer ( 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 8 , 300 477 mM NaCl , 20 mM imidazole and 1 mM DTT ) and were then transferred to a disposable column 478 ( Bio - Rad , USA ) . Protein was eluted using the elution buffer ( 50 mM phosphate buffer pH 8 , 300 479 mM NaCl , 250 mM imidazole and 1 mM DTT ) . Fractions containing the protein were concentrated 480 and loaded onto a size exclusion Superdex 200 increase 10 / 300 GL column ( Cytiva , USA ) pre - 481 equilibrated with 20 mM HEPES pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM KCl , 10 % glycerol and 0 . 5 mM DTT .

Frozen pellets were resuspended in 50 mM NaPO 4 pH 8 . 0 , 1 mM PMSF , 493 1 mM DTT , 20 mM imidazole , 300 mM NaCl and protease inhibitors as described above . Cells 494 were lysed by sonication with a tip sonicator while keeping the tubes on ice . The lysate was 495 cleared by centrifugation at 150 , 000 x g for 30 min at 4°C . The lysate was incubated for two hours 496 with Ni - NTA beads ( Qiagen ) . Non - specifically bound proteins were removed by washing the 497 beads with 20 mM NaPO 4 pH 8 . 0 , 50 mM imidazole , 300 mM NaCl and 1 mM DTT .

For all 519 experiments , coverslips were first cleaned by sonication in Micro90 detergent for 20 min , followed 520 by successive 20 min sonications in 1 M KOH , 1 M HCl and 200 proof ethanol for 20 min each . 521 Washed coverslips were then stored in fresh 200 proof ethanol . Coverslips were then washed 522 extensively with H 2 O and dried in an N 2 stream . These dried coverslips were coated with 2 mg / mL 523 methoxy - poly ( ethylene glycol ) ( mPEG ) - silane MW 2 , 000 and 2 µg / mL biotin - PEG - silane MW 524 3 , 400 ( Laysan Bio , USA ) in 80 % ethanol ( pH 2 . 0 ) and incubated overnight at 70°C . A 40 µm high 525 PDMS mold with 3 of 4 inlets and 1 outlet was mechanically clamped onto a PEG - Silane coated 526 coverslip . The chamber was then connected to a Maesflo microfluidic flow - control system 527 ( Fluigent , France ) , rinsed with TIRF buffer ( 10 mM imidazole pH 7 . 4 , 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 528 mM EGTA , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 10 mM DTT , 1 mM DABCO ) and incubated with 1 % BSA and 10 µg / mL 529 streptavidin in 20 mM HEPES pH 7 . 5 , and 50 mM KCl for 5 min . Depending upon the needs of 530 specific experiments , spectrin - seeds , biotinynlated - capping protein or biotinylated - formin was 531 then anchored on the surface by flowing them in TIRF buffer for 5 min . 532 For ADP - P i experiments ( Fig . 1G ) , the filaments were maintained in modified TIRF buffer ( regular 533 TIRF buffer supplemented with inorganic phosphate : 10 mM imidazole pH 7 . 4 , 34 . 8 mM K 2 HPO 4 534 and 15 . 2 mM KH 2 PO 4 , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 10 mM DTT , 1 mM DABCO ) 535 throughout the experiment . 536 Image acquisition and analysis 537 Multi - wavelength time - lapse TIRF imaging was performed on a Nikon - Ti2000 inverted 538 microscope equipped with a 40 mW 488 nm , 561 nm and 640 nm Argon lasers , a 60X TIRF - 539 objective with a numerical aperture of 1 . 49 ( Nikon Instruments Inc . , USA ) and an IXON LIFE 888 540 EMCCD camera ( Andor Ixon , UK ) . One pixel was equivalent to 144 × 144 nm . Focus was 541 maintained by the Perfect Focus system ( Nikon Instruments Inc . , Japan ) . Time - lapsed images 542 were acquired using Nikon Elements imaging software ( Nikon Instruments Inc . , Japan ) . 543 Images were analyzed in Fiji [ 64 ] . Background subtraction was conducted using the rolling ball 544 background subtraction algorithm ( ball radius 5 pixels ) . Time - lased images were corrected for 545 drift using Fiji Image Stabilizer plugin . For each condition , filaments were acquired across multiple 546 fields of view . To determine the rate of depolymerization , the in - built kymograph plugin was used 547 to draw kymographs of individual filaments . The kymograph slope was used to calculate barbed - 548 or pointed - end depolymerization rate of each individual filament ( assuming one actin subunit 549 contributes 2 . 7 nm to filament length ) . Data analysis and curve fitting were carried out in Microcal 550 24 Origin . All experiments were repeated at least three times and yielded similar results . Unless 551 otherwise mentioned , the data shown are from one trial . 552 Data availability : Data supporting the findings of this manuscript are available from the 553 corresponding author upon reasonable request . 554 25 References 555 1 .
