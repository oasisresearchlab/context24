In the last 60 years , hundreds of books have been written on the subject and hundreds of webpages display information on how to be more creative and achieve innovation . Several North American and European universities offer graduated programs in creativity . However , building an effective and validated creativity training program is not without challenges . Because of the nature of their work , engineers are often asked to be innovative . Without aiming for a degree in creativity , could future engineers benefit from training programs in creativity ? This article presents the conceptual framework and pedagogical elements of a new course in creativity for engineering students . KEYWORDS Creativity training , Conceptual framework , Engineering , Cognitive abilities , Training methodology . 1 . INTRODUCTION “ Creativity is just connecting things . ” – Steve Jobs ( Wolf , 1996 ) In this quote , Job’s identifies a key element of the creative process ( Wilkenfeld and Ward , 2001 ) . In keeping with the trend in popular culture toward an increasingly demystified view of creativity , educators have started to consider the importance of developing their students’ creativity . However , engineering has been mostly perceived as a mathematical and technical discipline . Stouffer ( 2004 ) reports that in 1998 , only 3 % of the public surveyed ( USA ) thought “creative” and “engineers” were associated words . This is an unfortunate situation as engineers are constantly asked to be innovative . This article presents a proposal for a new course dedicated to the development of cognitive abilities related to creativity in an engineering context . Based on a conceptual framework ( CHC model ) , this course is expected to increase students’ creative potential . 2 . CONTEXT The increased prominence of the word ‘creativity’ in everything from books and websites to consulting firms and university curricula , all speak to the perceived importance of creativity to the economy . In 2008 , the United Nations published a report to explain and promote the value of a creative economy ( CNUCED , 2008 ) . In 2009 the European Union named the year “The European Year of Creativity and Innovation” ( European , 2009 ) . To stay competitive , a company must constantly come up with new and better ideas . Multidisciplinary teams are put together to study the organizations’ activities and find ways to improve the processes and products . Typically , the fine arts ( domains such as visual arts , music , dance , design , etc . ) are most readily associated with the need for creativity . However , science could be considered equally creative ( Sawyer , 2012 ) . It is therefore important to help engineers and future scientists develop the competencies to optimize their creative potential . (cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:26)(cid:19) (cid:26)(cid:24)(cid:25)(cid:14)(cid:18)(cid:14)(cid:21)(cid:24)(cid:26)(cid:26)(cid:14)(cid:23)(cid:19)(cid:24)(cid:17)(cid:14)(cid:26)(cid:16)(cid:18)(cid:21)(cid:16)(cid:5)(cid:20)(cid:18)(cid:15)(cid:17)(cid:17)(cid:1)(cid:170)(cid:19)(cid:17)(cid:18)(cid:21)(cid:1)(cid:42)(cid:38)(cid:38)(cid:38) 2 . 1 . ENGINEERING AND CREATIVITY The need to study creativity and understand its underlying mechanisms is now globally accepted by the scientific community ( Baillie and Walker , 1998 , Richards , 1998 , Sawyer , 2012 ) . Numerous articles testify to the importance of the subject to the engineering community ( Badran , 2007 , Baillie and Walker , 1998 , Chiu and Salustri , 2010 , Cropley and Cropley , 2000 , Richards , 1998 ) . Being frequently in a position where there is a need for innovation , engineers should be able to actively participate in the creative process . Therefore , the development of creative skills as part of engineering training is essential , crucial , and indispensable . The next section will present a specific context in engineering education in which creativity training is progressing . Polytechnique Montreal ( PM ) is a well - known engineering school in the world . With hundreds of graduates every year and a research budget of $ 84M , PM is a pillar in the engineering community . PM’s 13 baccalaureate programs were remodeled 10 years ago , including integrating project based learning ( PBL ) every academic year . PBL is associated with the integration of basic knowledge , problem analysis and solution , and instrumentally with the development or mobilisation of creativity capacities . As such , students are primarily graded on the projects’ results , leaving the creative process as an accessory . Creativity might be assessed in some cases but only as a partial characteristic of the solution . In 2012 , PM created a 12 hour workshop for doctorate students called “ Creativity , yes we can ” . The course is offered every semester and is mandatory for all PhD students . Different educators offer different version of the workshop in English and in French . Both the content and pedagogical strategies result from the teacher’s own research and experience . PM acknowledges the need to develop its students’ creativity , in order to produce better engineers . 2 . 1 . 1 . The potential benefits PM will have the opportunity to become a leader in the field and include creativity as an academic subject . This course will initially be offered as an option , especially interesting for students studying project management , technological innovation , ergonomics / Human factors , industrial engineering , etc . It could eventually become part of the curriculum of all engineering programs . The goal is to develop cognitive abilities linked to creative behaviours , every student could benefit from such training . Looking even further and dreaming bigger , recurring creativity training in first and third year combined with an application in an integrative project , could completely transform how engineers and the public view the engineering profession . Practise is required to develop and maintain new abilities ( Badran , 2007 , Cropley and Cropley , 2000 , Sawyer , 2013 ) . Cognitive abilities in mathematics and physics must continually be used and improved ; it could be the same for creativity . Learning the basics of how the creative process works and how it can be enhanced may improve and complete engineers’ development . By better understanding the creative process and its cognitive implications , engineers are also expected to be more conversant with colleagues in other domains ( design , marketing , etc . ) . Moreover , it is hoped that they will be better equipped to discuss , participate and come up themselves with new ideas to stimulate innovation . 2 . 1 . 2 . The challenges Programs are already full with technical courses ; there is not much room left for additional subjects . The implication of the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board ( CEAB ) represents a big obstacle . Making room for a few hours of creativity training in the engineering curriculum will definitely be a big challenge . To achieve this goal , many challenges must be overcome . First , pre - conceived ideas and judgments about creativity itself have to be addressed . Students , educators , and managers , all have different perspectives on the subject . Managers will have to be convinced that creativity needs to be and can be developed . Educators will have to be adequately prepared to teach creativity and the cognitive abilities associated with it . Educators must also ensure that students are ready to develop their creativity . Finally , students will have to learn to be open minded about such a subject and its pedagogical implications even though the methods by which they develop competencies will differ from those of their other courses . There are practical challenges to overcome . Working spaces can affect creativity ( Kahl , 2012 ) . In a school , wooden desks , plastic chairs , white walls , and black boards are the norm , and these surroundings are not expected to bring out student creativity . If a complete creativity program existed , with multiple courses across engineering programs , it would be easier to justify the creation of a dedicated classroom organized to fit the needs of a creativity class . (cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:26)(cid:20) 2 . 2 . THEORETICAL BACKGROUND As Murdock ( 2011 ) explains , creativity does not have the same privileges as subjects like physics , in which elements are well defined and the pedagogical concerns are well established . Because creativity is still so connected to personal experiences and “recipe” books ( Michalko , 2006 , VanGundy , 2005 ) ( even best sellers ) , many people consider they know enough to teach how to be more creative . Creativity can be taught in so many ways , we believe educators and most importantly students would benefit from more direction on how to create an effective creativity training program . 2 . 2 . 1 . Intelligence and cognitive abilities In the 1990’s , J . B . Carroll develop an intelligence model that was well accepted by many scientists ( Carroll , 1993 , Newton and McGrew , 2010 ) . He created the CHC model ( Cattel - Horn - Carroll ) to classify various cognitive abilities . Some of these specific abilities can be related to the creative process and become the foundation of a training program . Three broad CHC abilities are particularly meaningful : fluid reasoning ( Gf ) , comprehension - knowledge ( Gc ) and long - term storage and retrieval ( Glr ) . Gf consists of the abilities related to executive processes , i . e . , the different aspects of reasoning . Gc represents rather the accumulation of knowledge . It used to be referred to as crystallised intelligence . Thirdly , Glr is closely linked to abilities that foster creativity . The 13 narrow abilities included in this broad ability can all be associated with different phases of a creative behaviour ( e . g . , associative memory , meaningful memory , ideational fluency , naming facility , etc . ) . To adapt the CHC model to creativity , we suggest creating a second level of abilities to further classify the Glr narrow abilities . With Gabora’s research on creativity on a cognitive level ( Gabora , 2010 , Gabora and Saab , 2011 ) , we added specific intermediate cognitive abilities : encoding , potentiality , divergent thinking , and convergent thinking . We believe that building pedagogical content and teaching strategies aimed at developing those specific abilities may improve students’ creative potential . The cognitive ability we call “encoding” refers to the way we store information in our brains . Neurons form a web - like network structure ( Hopfield , 1982 ) . Because creativity relies on the capacity to make remote associations between known elements , we hypothesize that individuals with wider and richer neurons networks will have greater creative potential . If we can help learners develop richer cognitive networks , we could help them improve their ability to draw connections . It has been shown that creative tasks ranging from highly constrained analogy problem solving to highly unconstrained art making involve the “actualization of potentiality” ( Gabora and Saab , 2011 ) . By this we mean the creative task induces a cognitive state that is an amalgam of potentially disparate thoughts , memories , and concepts , which feels subjectively like a ‘half - baked idea’ and which can be mathematically described as a state of superposition ( Aerts et al . , 2013 , Gabora and Aerts , 2002 , 2009 ) . It can unfold different ways depending on the different contexts it interacts with , i . e . , perspectives it is considered from . We suggest that by teaching students to be comfortable with half - baked ideas , and trust in their own abilities to develop them , students’ creative potential could be enhanced . Lastly , there is broad consensus that divergent thinking and convergent thinking , are at the center of the creative process . A creativity training program should cultivate these specific kinds of thinking processes . 2 . 2 . 2 . Pedagogical Elements Research by Scott and his colleagues ( Scott et al . , 2004a , b ) shows the latitude taken in every creativity training program aspect ( course design , techniques , media , etc . ) . They conducted a meta - analysis of 70 different creativity trainings . Though 10 years old , these articles contain the most recent and detailed information available on training programs . Their four conclusions are presented in the Table 1 ( Scott et al . , 2004a , b ) . Table 1 – Scott’s conclusions Conclusions • (cid:3) Training based on valid conception of the cognitive activities underlying creative efforts . • (cid:3) Lengthy , relatively challenging with various discrete cognitive skills , and associated heuristics . • (cid:3) Articulation of principles should be followed by illustrations of their application using material based on " real - world " cases or other contextual approaches . • (cid:3) Presentation should be followed by a series of exercises appropriate to the domain at hand . These conclusions are very general and lack details ( e . g . , how long is lengthy , what cognitive activities or skills should be developed , etc . ) . However , certain elements can be taken into account when creating a creativity training program . Finally , we suggest that activities or questions asked in creativity measuring tests ( Purdue Creativity Test , Finke’s Creative Invention Task , etc . ) be directly and explicitly used to train the brain to think creatively . These tests often incorporate tasks we are not accustomed to that could be put to good use . For example , in every class we could (cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:26)(cid:21) choose a different object ( not the usual brick ) and practise the “alternate uses” exercise ( famous test created by Guilford to assess creativity ) . Iterative practise of this task may help students develop the cognitive abilities linked to this task . When a specific project will require the use of a similar exercise , the learnings may be transferable . A great number of ideas can be found in those tests to build an effective training program . 2 . 3 . THE NEW TRAINING PROGRAM The course will be based on the hypothesis that developing cognitive abilities linked to creativity may enhance creative potential ( encoding , potentiality , divergent / convergent thinking ) . Numerous and various pedagogical strategies will be used to achieve that goal ( serious games , creativity approaches , conferences , individual and group projects , etc . ) . The next section will present the content as well as some of the chosen strategies with more details . 2 . 3 . 1 . The content The course’s program will include several different aspects of creativity , some more traditional than others . Theoretical elements will have to be presented and discussed but the development of cognitive abilities will be the center of attention . First of all , influential factors ( environmental , social , personal , organizational , etc . ) will be discussed . Their impact on creativity is well documented , and understanding them is important for metacognitive processes ( Barack and Goffer , 2002 , Kowaltowski et al . , 2010 , Richards , 1998 ) . Some educators base their training program on those factors . We agree with the importance of the knowledge of these factors but we also believe it is only a portion of the training to improve creative potential . Also , a few creativity approaches ( methods , techniques , activities ) will be explained and experienced ( e . g . : Mind - mapping , six hats , SCAMPER , bionics ) . So many methods and techniques exist , we think it is more profitable for students to explore a limited number of them and have the opportunity to try them than simply to describe globally dozens of those approaches . A hands - on experience is expected to be more efficient in the development of cognitive abilities than a masterful presentation . Creativity involves domain - general abilities as well as domain specific abilities ( Sawyer , 2012 ) . The course will include both . Engineering examples and projects will be used to transfer general cognitive abilities to engineering specific domains . The multiple integrative projects already in the curriculum will provide another opportunity to use the general abilities developed . Many researchers have described the importance of “lateral” or “flat” knowledge in the creativity process ( Litzinger et al . , 2011 , Yeh , 2011 ) . Being an expert in one subject is not the best path to creative behaviour . It is important to develop a deep understanding of a certain subject but it is also essential to learn many things in other domains . If one wants to connect remote elements in order to produce creative ideas , he has to know a lot of different topics ( Bonnardel , 2000 ) . To take into account these findings , the course will include artistic projects ( writing , singing , dancing , drawing , etc . ) and conferences in different themes like marketing , improvisation and invention . That will allow students to expand their knowledge hierarchy and stimulate remote associations . Finally , the element driving this new course , the development of cognitive abilities , will be a major part of the content . In every class , exercises will be devoted to developing abilities in encoding information , resolving an analogy and associative and analytical thinking . Simple activities , often in the form of serious games , will allow students to better understand how they think and what other mechanisms they could use to think “differently” . Not necessarily in a specific context , these serious games will help learners develop cognitive abilities without focusing them on a specific problem to resolve . Because there is evidence that improving creativity in a subject does not necessarily help in another ( Baer and Kaufman , 2005 ) , we hope to develop general abilities that readily transfer to other domains . 2 . 3 . 2 . The pedagogical and practical aspects Various pedagogical strategies will be used in this new course . Conferences , discussions , serious games , individual and group projects , etc . , will allow students to look at creativity in different ways . The Table 2 below presents some examples of pedagogical choices . The most unusual activity is probably the warm - up exercises . Based on the need to practise to develop skills ( Rasmussen , 1983 ) , i . e . repeat the same movements many times in order to master them , these serious games sessions will allow learners to become more familiar with the cognitive abilities linked with creativity ( Cropley and Cropley , 2000 ) . (cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:26)(cid:22) Table 2 – Pedagogical choices Pedagogical Activities Subject / Objective Warm - up exercises • (cid:3) ½ h at the beginning of every class , different versions of the same exercises , individual and group Cognitive abilities ( associative and analytical thinking , encoding , potentiality ) Conferences • (cid:3) 1 ½ h , invited speaker , presentation + exercises Marketing Improvisation Invention Log book • (cid:3) Individual task , spread on all semester , evaluate a few times during the semester , students note observations , ideas , problems , solutions , etc . Being a better observer , more critical towards what you see Artistic Project • (cid:3) Individual project , students choose their subject , first half of semester , presentation to group Expand knowledge in different domains Engineering project • (cid:3) Group project , students choose the problem they want to tackle , second half of semester , presentation to group Apply new cognitive abilities The room is to become a practical matter . A room very different from typical classrooms will be necessary to take students out of their usual surroundings and comfort zone . Chairs , tables , wall colors , posters , lights , decoration , etc . , everything will be out of the ordinary . Ideally , each semester , students could create a new environment by bringing personal pieces to the space . We could take advantage of this setting to create different exercises every semester . Assessing creativity has been the source of numerous articles ( Charyton et al . , 2011 , Clary et al . , 2011 , Shah et al . , 2003 , Villalba , 2012 ) . There is no consensus as to how creativity should be evaluated in a specific context . For assessing creativity in an educational context , we favor the enhancement of the creative potential instead of the level of creativity . In short , we want to assess the progress made by students and their efforts towards these improvements and not only the actual creative performance . To achieve that goal , we present in Table 3 a few examples of evaluation choices . The CEDA instrument has been developed by Charyton ( Charyton , 2014 , Charyton et al . , 2008 , Charyton et al . , 2011 ) . Especially made for engineering students , it gives a score based on a judging process . By giving the test on the first and the last class , we expect to find an improvement in the individual scores . To minimize any doubts around the evaluation process of this new course , other evaluation methods will assess different aspects of the creative process . Table 3 – Evaluation choices Evaluation choices Aspects • (cid:3) CEDA ( Creative Engineering Design Assessment ) • (cid:3) Creative potential improvements • (cid:3) Participation ( in class ) • (cid:3) Personal implication ( intrinsic motivation ) • (cid:3) Oral presentation ( creativity approaches ) • (cid:3) Research , originality , convincing abilities • (cid:3) Log book • (cid:3) Observation ability , Openness to problem finding • (cid:3) Artistic project / Engineering project • (cid:3) Individual and group work • (cid:3) Mid - term ( mind map ) • (cid:3) Knowledge of the subject ( theories , models , methods , etc . ) 4 . CONCLUSIONS We presented a new course that will allow the engineering community to see how creativity can be taught and what impacts such a course may have on future engineers . This could be the beginning of a new vision of creativity training programs for engineers and other scientists . A number of domains ( e . g . , medicine or business ) could take advantage of these learnings and integrate creativity into their program . Fostering innovation by enhancing creative cognitive abilities could be profitable in numerous subjects . Additionally , organizations could definitely benefit from these research and results . They could include creativity training programs as part of their continuous training program and offer employees recurring creativity workouts to develop and maintain their creative abilities . We hope that innovative engineering feats will emerge from these next steps in creativity training research .
