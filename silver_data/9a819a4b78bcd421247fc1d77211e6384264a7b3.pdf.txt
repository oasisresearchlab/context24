As a result , post - lockdown COVID - 19 dynamics are heterogeneous and difficult to interpret . We describe a set of contact surveys performed in four Chinese cities ( Wuhan , Shanghai , Shenzhen , and Changsha ) during the pre - pandemic , lockdown and post - lockdown periods to quantify changes in contact patterns . In the post - lockdown period , the mean number of contacts increased by 5 to 17 % as compared to the lockdown period . However , it remains three to seven times lower than its pre - pandemic level sufficient to control SARS - CoV - 2 transmission . We find that the impact of school interventions depends nonlinearly on the intensity of other activities . When most community activities are halted , school closure leads to a 77 % decrease in the repro - duction number ; in contrast , when social mixing outside of schools is at pre - pandemic level , school closure leads to a 5 % reduction in transmission . INTRODUCTION The novel coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) outbreak caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) began in Wuhan City , China in December 2019 and quickly became a global pandemic on 11 March 2020 ( 1 ) . As of 30 July , a total of 84 , 292 cases of COVID - 19 , including 4634 deaths , have been re - ported in mainland China ( 2 ) . The epidemic in Wuhan and in the rest of China subsided quickly after implementation of strict con - tainment measures and travel restrictions . With the reduction of domestic cases in China and recent cases primarily originating from international travel ( 2 ) , strict interventions have been gradually re - laxed since February 2020 . In most of mainland China outside of Hubei Province , workplaces were allowed to resume operations after 10 February 2020 ( 3 ) . Close community management ( e . g . , only one household member was al - lowed to purchase supplies every 3 days ) and travel restrictions were lifted in March , and schools reopened at the end of April 2020 . Sim - ilarly , the lockdown ended on 8 April 2020 in Wuhan . It has been widely argued that relaxing inventions increases the risk of resur - gence as transmission may intensify , a prediction that has been borne out in southern United States and Europe ( 4 – 8 ) . However , despite interventions being relaxed and continuous importation of new infections , a second wave in China has yet to materialize . Key questions remain about how relaxing interventions alters age - specific contact patterns and may , in turn , affect transmission . Quantifying the interaction between interventions and contacts is a key step to understand the post - lockdown SARS - CoV - 2 transmission patterns . This study aims to measure changes in mixing patterns as interven - tions are gradually relaxed to understand their impact on epidemic spread . To achieve this aim , we collected contact survey data in three different phases of the pandemic ( before the pandemic , during the lockdown , and while interventions were being relaxed—post - lockdown phase ) in four locations in China ( Wuhan , Shanghai , Shenzhen , and Changsha ) . The post - lockdown phase was set at 1 month after the start of workplace reopening and relaxation of other measures ( citywide close community management and mo - bility restrictions ) at a time when there was no local transmission . The rationale for the definition of the post - lockdown period was to capture a time horizon when people were gradually coming out of a full lockdown . We aimed to investigate whether social interactions would increase relatively quickly over that horizon , leading to a pu - tative resurgence of cases . On the basis of the collected data , we in - vestigate changes in age - stratified contact patterns and provide a model - based evaluation of their impact on the SARS - CoV - 2 trans - mission . Moreover , we leverage the calibrated model to project the impact of a hypothetical further increase in the number of contacts on the emergence of a second wave . RESULTS Contact surveys We performed diary - based contact surveys ( 9 – 12 ) in four Chinese cities ( Wuhan , Shanghai , Shenzhen , and Changsha ) representing different epidemiological situations . Wuhan was the early epicenter of the outbreak . Shanghai is a highly connected international hub and , thus , has been experiencing continuous importations of COVID - 19 cases . Shenzhen is a major hub in Guangdong Province , which re - ported the largest number of COVID - 19 cases outside Hubei Province . Changsha is a city of Hunan Province adjacent to Hubei Province with a large number of commuters’ influx to and from Hubei . The surveys were conducted from 1 to 20 March 2020 in Shanghai , Shenzhen , and Changsha , about 1 month after workplaces started to reopen on 10 February . In Wuhan , the survey was performed from 7 to 15 May 2020 , about 1 month after the end of the lockdown ( 8 April ) . We collected information on weekday contact behavior 1 School of Public Health , Fudan University , Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety , Ministry of Education , Shanghai , China . 2 Department of Epidemiology and Biosta - tistics , Indiana University School of Public Health , Bloomington , IN , USA . 3 ISI Foun - dation , Turin , Italy . 4 Laboratory for the Modeling of Biological and Socio - technical Systems , Northeastern University , Boston , MA , USA . 5 Division of International Epi - demiology and Population Studies , Fogarty International Center , National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , MD , USA . 6 Department of infectious diseases , Huashan Hospital , Fudan University . 7 Shanghai Institute of Infectious Disease and Biosecurity , Fudan University . * Corresponding author .

At the time of the contact survey , schools had not reopened except for the final year of senior high school in Wuhan , but travel restrictions and community management had begun to relax ( Fig . 1 ) ( section S1 ) . Characteristics of contact patterns We analyzed a total of 54 , 324 contacts reported by 9206 study par - ticipants ( Table 1 ) . In Wuhan , the average daily number of contacts per participant significantly increased from 2 . 0 during the outbreak period ( mean contacts weighted by age structure : 1 . 9 ) to 3 . 3 in the post - lockdown period ( mean contacts weighted by age structure : 3 . 6 ) ( P < 0 . 001 ) . The increase in contacts was significantly different by sex , age , type of profession , and household size , with the exception of respondents under 20 years ( Table 1 ) . A smaller increase was observed in Shanghai , Shenzhen , and Changsha , where the average daily number of contacts increased by 0 . 1 to 0 . 4 contacts per day ( 0 . 2 to 0 . 8 for the mean number of contacts weighted by the age structure ) starting from about 2 . 2 contacts during the lockdown period . The observed increase in the number of contacts ( especially among adults ) is statistically significant for Wuhan , Shanghai , and Shenzhen ( Table 1 ) . Participants in the four cities essentially report - ed the same number of contacts during the lockdown , but on aver - age , individuals in Wuhan reported more contacts than individuals in the other cities in the post - lockdown period , possibly because of the different timing of the contact surveys in the four locations ( section S3 . 2 ) . In the four cities , the vast majority of contacts occurred at home in both periods , but workplace contacts increased in the post - lockdown period ( sections S3 . 4 and S3 . 5 ) . Moreover , a statistically significant B A C D Fig . 1 . Number of COVID - 19 reported cases , timing of the surveys , and the main interventions in place over time . ( A ) Wuhan . ( B ) Shanghai .

The contact surveys for Shanghai , Shenzhen , and Changsha were conducted from 1 to 20 March , corresponding to the period of relaxation of interventions , and 7 to 15 May for Wuhan . The contact diaries for the baseline and outbreak periods were derived from retrospective interviews or previous surveys . The horizontal bars at the bottom of each panel represent the intensity over time of the four main performed interventions , where the height of the bar refers to the relative share of population affected by the intervention with the exception of close community management . With relatively small number of cases , the close community management was limited to subcity areas where cases were identified . The de - tailed timeline of the interventions is reported in table S1 . Note that the school and university closure starting in mid - January was the regular winter break before the Lunar New Year holiday . In the absence of the pandemic , schools were set to reopen around mid - February 2020 , while universities were scheduled to reopen between 4 February and 1 March 2020 . However , because of the pandemic , these closures were extended . Zhang et al . , Sci .

Overall , the number of contacts increased over time from the outbreak period to the post - lockdown period ( P < 0 . 001 ) ( section S3 . 6 ) . When we consider the pre - pandemic ( baseline ) period , the typi - cal features of age - mixing patterns ( 10 , 11 ) emerge in all locations ( Fig . 2 , A to D ) . These features can be illustrated in the form of age - stratified contact matrices ( provided as ready - to - use tables in section S3 . 7 ) , where each cell represents the mean number of contacts that an individual of a certain age group has with other individuals of different ages . The bottom left corner of the matrix , corresponding to contacts between school - age children , is where the largest number of contacts is recorded . The contribution of contacts in the workplace is visible in the central part of the matrix , while the three diagonals ( from bot - tom left to top right ) represent contacts between household members . During the COVID - 19 outbreak period , when strict social dis - tancing policies were in place , most of the abovementioned features disappear , essentially leaving the sole contribution of household mixing ( Fig . 2 , E to H ) . In particular , assortative contacts between school - age individuals fully vanish . Overall , contacts during the outbreak mostly occurred within household members ( more than 90 % in Shenzhen , Changsha , and Wuhan ; 79 % in Shanghai ) . If we compare the post - lockdown period with the outbreak period , more contacts were reinstated in the workplace and in community set - tings . Therefore , the fraction of contacts at home decreased to 63 . 0 % in Wuhan , 72 . 5 % in Shanghai , 70 . 2 % in Shenzhen , and 78 . 8 % in Changsha . Nevertheless , the three diagonals ( from bottom left to top right ) representing contacts between household members were still dominant . Note that while strict social distancing measures gradually relaxed in these four locations , a considerable share of workers had not yet resumed work or continued to work from home at the time of the survey ( section S3 . 5 ) . Modeling the impact of relaxing interventions on SARS - CoV - 2 transmission We used the next - generation matrix approach to quantify changes in R 0 during the post - lockdown period , as interventions were relaxed .

In this study , we extended this range from 1 to 4 for the baseline period ( i . e . , before interventions ) . We found that the con - siderable changes of mixing patterns observed in Shenzhen and Changsha during the social distancing period led to a drastic de - crease in R 0 ( Fig . 3 ) . The reproductive number drops well below the epidemic threshold for all four locations . When we considered contacts in the post - lockdown period , while keeping the same baseline disease transmissibility as in the preintervention period at an average value of R 0 = 2 . 5 , the increase in the number of contacts was not high enough to bring R 0 above 1 in any location . The reproductive number exceeded the epidemic threshold in Wuhan ( Fig . 3A ) and Shenzhen ( Fig . 3C ) for baseline R 0 above 3 . 0 , and in Changsha ( Fig . 3D ) for baseline R 0 above 3 . 5 . The reproductive number in Shanghai did not reach the threshold even for baseline R 0 = 4 ( Fig . 3B ) . These findings are robust to as - sumptions about age differences in susceptibility to infection in Wuhan , Shanghai , and Shenzhen ( Fig . 3 , E to G ) . Considering age differences in susceptibility to infection has a marked effect in pre - dicted dynamics in Changsha , where transmission can be inter - rupted for baseline R 0 at least up to four ( Fig . 3H ) . We performed sensitivity analyses regarding age differences in infectiousness ; an average individual aged 0 to 14 years was assumed to be twice less infectious than one aged above 14 years old . The results are consis - tent with those reported here ( section S6 . 1 ) . We also performed sensitivity analyses regarding possible compliance biases of self - reported contacts during the post - lockdown period . In this case , by assuming baseline R 0 = 2 . 5 and by making the extreme as - sumption that only half of the actual nonhousehold contacts were reported by study participants , the reproduction number for post - lockdown period would still be below the threshold or slightly above it ( section S6 . 2 ) . Impact of a possible return to pre - pandemic mixing patterns in schools , workplaces , and the community We performed scenario analyses for Shanghai where we assume that contacts at school , in the workplace , and the community return to the levels reported during the pre - pandemic period . In this anal - ysis , we set R 0 = 2 . 5 to be in line with R 0 measured in Wuhan before the start of the interventions ( 16 ) and age - specific susceptibility to infection as estimated in our previous study ( 9 ) . By assuming no contacts at school , we estimate that , in the ab - sence of contact tracing and other control measures , 55 % of workplace and 65 % of community mixing could be resumed while keeping R 0 below the epidemic threshold . In particular , a reduction of 80 % of effective contacts in the community ( corresponding to 1 . 2 contacts per day ) would allow the work contacts to be resumed at 50 % ( Fig . 4A ) . Opening of senior high schools , even when considering as little as 10 % of workplace and 10 % of community contacts , could increase R 0 above 1 ( Fig . 4B ) . Broader school opening has a higher effect on R 0 ( Fig . 4C ) . A E B F C G D H Fig . 3 . Effect of relaxing interventions on epidemic spread ( assuming equal infectiousness by age ) . ( A ) Estimated R 0 during the outbreak and post - lockdown peri - ods [ mean and 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) ] as a function of baseline R 0 ( i . e . , that derived by using the contact matrix estimated from the baseline period ) . The distribution of the transmission rate is estimated through the next - generation matrix approach by using 100 bootstrapped contact matrices for the baseline period to obtain the desired R 0 values . We then use the estimated distribution of the transmission rate and the bootstrapped outbreak and post - lockdown contact matrices to estimate R 0 for the outbreak period and the post - lockdown period , respectively . The 95 % CIs account for uncertainty in the distribution of the transmission rate , mixing patterns , and susceptibility to infection by age . ( B to D ) Same as ( A ) , but for Shanghai , Shenzhen , and Changsha . The figure includes both the scenario accounting for susceptibility to infection by age and the scenario where we assume that all individuals are equally susceptible to infection . ( A ) to ( D ) refer to the first scenario , and ( E ) to ( H ) refer to the second scenario . Zhang et al . , Sci . Adv . 2021 ; 7 : eabe2584 7 May 2021 S C I E N C E A D V A N C E S | R E S E A R C H A R T I C L E 6 of 10 It is important to highlight that the effect of school closure de - pends nonlinearly on the share of other activities being resumed ( Fig . 4D ) . In particular , if we compare R 0 in an extreme scenario when nearly all workplace and community activities are halted ( i . e . , only 5 % workplace and community contacts included , which is about the same level observed during the lockdown period—about 4 % ) , we can see that school closure corresponds to a decrease of R 0 from 1 . 78 to 0 . 41 . On the contrary , in a scenario where workplace and community contacts return to their pre - pandemic level ( i . e . , 100 % ) , school closure corresponds to a decrease of R 0 of about 0 . 13 . In other words , social contacts in schools only truly matter if other social mixing opportunities are hindered . In this context of greatly re - duced contact patterns at work and in the community , school clo - sure becomes determinant in controlling disease spread . If contacts in other social settings are moderate or back to normal , then school closure is less relevant as the infection can spread through other chains of transmission . This effect is nonlinear and is captured by the change of the eigenvalues of the next - generation matrix . When we consider relaxing interventions simultaneously ( e . g . , school reopening , workplace resumption , and resuming community activities ) , returning up to 34 % of the pre - pandemic level of non - household contacts ( corresponding to a mean of 7 . 8 contacts per day ) can lead R 0 above the threshold in Shanghai , with slightly lower proportions ( 26 to 30 % , corresponding to 3 . 4 to 5 . 5 contacts per day ) in Shenzhen , Changsha , and Wuhan ( section S9 ) . DISCUSSION We have provided measures of the changes in mixing patterns linked to gradual relaxation of interventions in the Chinese cities of Wuhan , Shanghai , Shenzhen , and Changsha and their impact on the spread of SARS - CoV - 2 . We find that although the number of contacts has increased in the post - lockdown period in China , social behavior has only partially and slowly changed and mixing patterns have not re - turned to normal , including among adults . We estimate that the increase in mixing patterns 1 month after the Wuhan lockdown was lifted and after work resumed in the other three cities was not enough to sustain local transmission . The mixing patterns measured in this study were far from the pre - pandemic ones . We also estimate that the importance of school closure / reopening on SARS - CoV - 2 con - trol increases in a nonlinear fashion as contacts in the other settings decrease . In particular , our findings support that closing schools was essential to keep the epidemic under control during the lockdown . Several studies have shown a very marked decrease in the num - ber of contacts between the pre - pandemic and lockdown periods ( 9 , 20 – 24 ) , in agreement with what we found here , which parallels a Fig . 4 . Estimated R 0 for Shanghai under different assumptions on the number of contacts in workplaces , community , and schools . ( A ) Heatmap of the estimated mean value of R 0 for a different combination of number of contacts in the workplaces and community under the assumption that all schools are closed . Share equal to 1 corresponds to the pre - pandemic contact pattern . The triangle corresponds to the measured share of contacts in the workplace and the community during the post - lockdown period . Baseline period R 0 was set to 2 . 5 , and we considered age - specific susceptibility to infection as in ( 9 ) , and no differences in infectiousness by age . R 0 values are estimated through the next - generation matrix approach . ( B ) Same as ( A ) , but assuming that contacts in senior high schools are as in the pre - pandemic pe - riod .

( D ) Estimated mean value of R 0 for different shares of workplace and community contacts under different levels of school closure . Zhang et al . , Sci .

However , our study shows that the post - lockdown increase in mobility patterns is not a good proxy of the daily number of in contacts in the four study locations ( sec - tion S4 ) . The intracity mobility in the analyzed cities has also been rebounding to pre - pandemic levels , while contacts in the same pe - riod are still very close to the ones estimated during the lockdown period . Several studies for different countries have shown a rebound in mobility after the lockdown ( 26 – 29 ) . However , the much slower increase in the number of daily contacts that we estimated here could be location - specific . A similar pattern has been found in the United States where mobility measured by mobile phone data has rebounded to pre - pandemic levels , but the number of contacts quantified by co - proximity is still at 50 % or less of pre - pandemic levels ( 30 ) . Whether these results can be generalized to other coun - tries remains unclear . To estimate how changes in contact patterns affect SARS - CoV - 2 spread , we performed a model - based analysis . In particular , we es - timated that the level of contacts recorded during the post - lockdown period in spring 2020 is sufficient to keep the reproduction number below the epidemic threshold . On the contrary , in a purely theoret - ical scenario where all schools were open but parents could agree to stay at home , social distancing among adults would not be sufficient to prevent a COVID - 19 outbreak . This highlights the need for con - sidering additional case - and population - based interventions such as those in place in China since the end of the lockdown ( e . g . , 14 - day quarantine in designated places for medical observation and testing for imported cases and use of face masks ) . However , it is important to stress that the population may spontaneously adjust its behavior , including avoidance of gatherings and adherence to hygiene mea - sures , to limit their risk of SARS - CoV - 2 infection while the pan - demic is still spreading worldwide . These behavioral adaptations may partially explain why the number of contacts measured in this study in the post - lockdown period is still remarkably lower than before the pandemic . This study is prone to the limitations pertaining to social contact surveys . The definition of contact relevant for SARS - CoV - 2 trans - mission is still unclear . We used the classic definition of having a conversation or direct physical contact ( 9 ) , which does not include contacts with surfaces ( fomite transmission ) that may have been possibly contaminated by infectious individuals . However , contacts with surfaces are hard to quantify , irrespective of the adopted meth - odology , and their contribution on SARS - CoV - 2 transmission has yet to be clarified . The contact survey presented in this study is based on self - reported contacts . It can thus be affected by various biases , including recall bias and self - reporting bias . In particular , reported contacts for the baseline period in Wuhan , Shenzhen , and Changsha may be prone to recall bias as contacts were recorded retrospectively with delays up to 1 month in Wuhan and up to 2 to 3 months in Shenzhen and Changsha ( table S2 ) . This may explain why we ob - served a larger number of contacts during that period in Shanghai with respect to the other three locations and less marked typical features of contact matrices by age ( such as the presence of three main diagonals representing contacts among household members , a bottom - left corner showing contacts among students , and a cen - tral area showing contacts between workers ) in these three locations with respect to Shanghai . Nonetheless , it is important to stress that the mean number of daily contacts estimated for the four locations during the pre - pandemic period is comparable to that obtained in other countries ( 10 , 31 , 32 ) , ranging from 4 . 5 contacts per day in Japan ( 32 ) to 27 contacts per day in the United Kingdom ( 33 ) . More - over , the age - stratified contact matrices presented in those studies share the same features as those presented here . Another possible bias is that survey participants may have felt pressure to minimize reported contacts that occurred during the post - lockdown period , given that social distancing policy has not been totally relaxed , even if the anonymity and confidentiality of the survey were emphasized . However , results are robust to inflating reported contacts outside of the home severalfold , suggesting that possible compliance and so - cial acceptability biases linked to the post - lockdown period do not affect our main findings ( section S6 . 2 ) . Our modeling analysis contains several approximations . The model does not consider explicitly symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals and possible differences in their infectiousness and / or mixing patterns . Explicit modeling of symptomatic / asymptomatic individuals would require assumptions on contact patterns for symptomatic / asymptomatic individuals , as this information was not collected in our surveys . In particular , it is possible that the differ - ence in mixing patterns observed in the pre - pandemic , outbreak , and post - lockdown phase would be less marked for symptomatic individuals ( especially for severe ones ) . Therefore , our estimates of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in the post - lockdown phase may be slightly underestimated . On the other hand , the model assumes a homoge - neous network of contacts ( i . e . , it does not account for the typical clustering of human contacts ) , and thus , our results can be consid - ered an upper bound of SARS - CoV - 2 transmissibility . The adopted transmission scheme is simple and does not explicitly account for different levels of the severity pyramid , such as hospitalizations or deaths . Estimates of incidence and disease burden are beyond the scope of the paper ; our model was designed to provide a general view of the effect of age - mixing patterns on SARS - CoV - 2 transmission rather than direct projections of the pandemic on the healthcare system . We would like to stress that here we do not necessarily endorse relaxing or reinstating social distancing policies in the context of COVID - 19 , but rather merely describe their impact on SARS - CoV - 2 transmission based on the data collected in four Chinese cities . Our contact surveys were conducted about 1 month after social distanc - ing measures started to be relaxed in China and cover a period of 1 to 3 weeks in each study location . Whether these findings can be generalized to other locations or how and to what extent mixing pat - terns have evolved over time warrants further research . It remains unclear how long people would be able to sustain a reduced level of social restrictions , as observed right after the lockdown . Additional and more recent contact surveys should be conducted in the pan - demic and post - pandemic period in a number of countries . Under - standing compliance to interventions and long - term changes in contact patterns because of COVID - 19 will be a rich area for future research . From 1 June to 12 December 2020 , China has experienced four local outbreaks with more than 50 cases : An outbreak of 335 cases was reported in Beijing , one of 826 cases in Urumqi in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region , one of 92 cases in Dalian in Liaoning Province , and one of 78 cases in Kashgar Prefecture in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region ( 34 ) . This supports our modeling re - sults indicating that the reproduction number may easily cross the epidemic threshold when schools are open . However , none of these outbreaks escalated to a nationwide level as prompt and strict interventions were put in place in reaction to these flare - ups . Moving forward , to prevent the resurgence of the epidemic , it will Zhang et al . , Sci . Adv . 2021 ; 7 : eabe2584 7 May 2021 S C I E N C E A D V A N C E S | R E S E A R C H A R T I C L E 8 of 10 be particularly important to strengthen sanitization activities ( e . g . , washing hands and disinfection ) and proactive social distancing measures ( e . g . , increased distance between individuals while in con - tact or use of a face mask ) , along with large - scale testing and contact tracing ( 35 – 38 ) . This is particularly important when schools are open ( 39 ) and during festivities , when an increase of intercity mo - bility , inbound travelers , and more social mixing between people and households can be anticipated . Researches should continue to focus on refining age - specific estimates of susceptibility to infec - tion , infectiousness , and risk of severe disease , in conjunction with changes in mixing patterns , as these are instrumental to evaluate the impact of control strategies on SARS - CoV - 2 transmission . MATERIALS AND METHODS Design of the contact survey To estimate changes in age - mixing patterns associated with relax - ation of interventions against SARS - CoV - 2 , we conducted contact surveys in four cities . The design of the survey was similar to that of our previous work ( 9 – 11 ) . Participants in Shenzhen and Changsha were asked to complete a questionnaire describing their contact behavior ( 9 , 12 ) on three different days : ( i ) a regular weekday be - tween 24 and 30 December 2019 , before the COVID - 19 outbreak was officially declared ( baseline period ) ; ( ii ) a day between 3 and 9 February 2020 when the COVID - 19 epidemic peaked across China and stringent interventions were in place ( outbreak period ) ; and ( iii ) the day before the telephone interview took place , corresponding to a period when interventions were being relaxed across China ( post - lockdown period ) . A contact was defined as either a two - way conversation involving three or more words in the physical pres - ence of another person or a direct physical contact ( e . g . , a hand - shake ) . Participants in Wuhan and Shanghai were asked to complete the same questionnaire used for Shenzhen and Changsha , but to re - port only the contacts during the post - lockdown period . For the baseline and outbreak period in Wuhan and Shanghai , we relied on a survey conducted in 2017 – 2018 and another survey conducted in 2020 during the pandemic that followed the same design ( 9 , 10 ) . A more detailed description of the methodology is given in the Sup - plementary Materials ( sections S1 and S2 ) . Estimation of contact patterns The number of daily contacts ( including physical and conversation - al contacts ) was compared between the post - lockdown period and the outbreak period for each location using a weighted negative bi - nomial regression , where the weight refers to the day type of contact diary ( i . e . , weekdays or weekends ) ( 9 ) . The same comparison was performed among four cities for the outbreak period and the post - lockdown period , respectively . We defined 16 age groups ( 0 to 4 years , 5 to 9 years , 10 to 14 years , 15 to 19 years , 20 to 24 years , 25 to 29 years , 30 to 34 years , 35 to 39 years , 40 to 44 years , 45 to 49 years , 50 to 54 years , 55 to 59 years , 60 to 64 years , 65 to 69 years , 70 to 74 years , and 75 years and over ) to build age - specific contact matrices . Contact matrices representing mixing patterns during a baseline pre - pandemic day ( referred to as “baseline period contact matrix” ) , during the COVID - 19 outbreak ( referred to as “outbreak contact matrix” ) , and during the period of relaxation of interventions ( referred to as “post - lockdown contact matrix” ) were estimated for the four cities . Because of the sample size , for baseline and outbreak contact matrices in Wuhan , we used 14 age groups ( last age group being 65 + years ) . To account for the uncertainty of the contact matrices and sample representativeness of contact matrix , we performed bootstrap sampling with replace - ment of survey participants weighted by the age distribution of the actual population in each location . For the post - lockdown period , we adjusted for weekdays and weekends ( weight of 2 / 7 for diaries referring to Saturdays / Sundays , weight of 5 / 7 for diaries referring to Monday to Friday ) ( 9 ) . SARS - CoV - 2 natural history and transmission To explore how our empirical data can inform how to relax COVID - 19 control strategies , we performed a modeling exercise . A key param - eter regulating the dynamics of an epidemic is the basic reproduction number ( R 0 ) , which corresponds to the average number of secondary cases generated by an index case in a fully susceptible population . We estimated the impact of relaxing interventions on R 0 , relying on the empirically estimated mixing patterns . We also considered age - specific estimates of susceptibility to infection presented in ( 9 ) and no differential infectiousness by age ( 40 ) . We also consider sce - narios where all age groups are equally susceptible by age and where children are twice less infectious than adults ( section S6 . 1 ) . The mean time interval between two consecutive generations of cases was set to be 5 . 1 days , aligning with the mean of the serial interval reported by Zhang et al . ( 41 ) . Last , we used the next - generation matrix ap - proach to quantify estimate R 0 ( section S5 ) ( 42 ) . Simulation of hypothetical scenarios with alternative mixing patterns We project how increasing school , workplace , and community con - tacts can affect COVID - 19 spread in Shanghai . We considered sev - eral different scenarios , on the basis of the baseline contact matrix and gradual implementation of interventions by social setting ( i . e . , household , school , workplace , and community ) . A similar analysis was performed for Shenzhen and Changsha ( section S8 ) . No simu - lations were performed for Wuhan , as for this location we did not collect data by social setting for the baseline period ( 9 ) . We finally used the same next - generation matrix approach to project what de - gree of return to pre - pandemic contact could lead R 0 above the epi - demic threshold if the contacts outside the household are resumed simultaneously ( section S9 ) .
