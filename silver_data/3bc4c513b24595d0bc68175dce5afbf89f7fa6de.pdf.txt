Beef myofibers Introduction According to the Domestic Animal Diversity Information System ( FAO - DAD - IS ) , there are over 70 cattle breeds widely distributed in China , with 53 of them being indig - enous [ 1 , 2 ] . Native breeds are divided into three catego - ries in accordance with their geographical distribution , including northern - distributed group , central - distributed BMC Genomics * Correspondence : Guangbin Liu gbliu @ scau . edu . cn Baoli Sun baolisun @ scau . edu . cn 1 College of Animal Science , South China Agricultural University , No . 483 Wushan Road , Guangzhou 510642 , China Abstract This paper aims to explore the role of circRNA expression profiles and circRNA - associated ceRNA networks in the regulation of myogenesis in the longissimus dorsi of cattle breeds surviving under subtropical conditions in southern China by RNA sequencing and bioinformatics analysis . It also aims to provide comprehensive understanding of the differences in muscle fibers in subtropical cattle breeds and to expand the knowledge of the molecular networks that regulate myogenesis . With regard to meat quality indicators , results showed that the longissimus dorsi of LQC had lower pH ( P < 0 . 0001 ) , lower redness ( P < 0 . 01 ) , lower shear force ( P < 0 . 05 ) , and higher brightness ( P < 0 . 05 ) than the longissimus dorsi of LFC . With regard to muscle fiber characteristics , the longissimus dorsi of LQC had a smaller diameter ( P < 0 . 0001 ) and higher density of muscle fibers ( P < 0 . 05 ) . The analysis results show that the function of many circRNA - targeted mRNAs was related to myogenesis and metabolic regulation . Furthermore , in the analysis of the function of circRNA source genes , we hypothesized that btacirc _ 00497 and btacirc _ 034497 may regulate the function and type of myofibrils by affecting the expression of MYH6 , MYH7 , and NEB through competitive linear splicing .

BMC Genomics ( 2023 ) 24 : 499 can affect the traits to a certain extent , such as tender - ness , color , and pH drop of beef [ 8 ] . Thus , among the fac - tors that can affect meat quality , myofiber is the strongest [ 9 , 10 ] . However , the growth and development of muscle fibers include ontogeny at different embryonic stages , as well as hypertrophy and transformation at postnatal stages [ 9 , 11 ] . In addition , the process of myogenesis is a complex biological process regulated by multiple fac - tors , such as myogenic regulatory factors [ 12 ] , signal - ing pathways [ 13 ] , noncoding RNAs ( ncRNAs ) [ 14 ] , and genes . Among these factors , circular RNA ( circRNA ) is an ncRNA with a covalently closed continuous loop structure that can play a role in gene regulation by com - peting with linear splicing [ 15 ] , and this factor plays an important regulatory role in myogenesis [ 16 ] . In addition , the function of circRNA as a sponge of miRNA may indi - rectly affect the translation of mRNA [ 17 ] . CircRNA can be found in bovine muscle , and it is involved in the regu - lation of myogenesis [ 18 – 20 ] . Leiqiong cattle ( LQN ) and Lufeng cattle ( LFN ) are native cattle breeds in South China , which are primarily distributed in Guangdong and Hainan Provinces . These two kinds of cattle live in a subtropical climate environ - ment for a long time , and they are less affected by arti - ficial introduction . In addition , the breeding scale is considerable . The genetic relationship between LQN and LFN cattle is close , but their physical appearance , such as is quite different [ 5 ] . In this study , we compared the cir - cRNA transcripts in longissimus dorsi from two types of southern Chinese cattle , then constructed and analyzed the circRNA - associated ceRNA network . These results could provide comprehensive understanding of the dif - ferences in muscle fiber development in cattle grown under subtropical conditions and extend our understand - ing of the molecular networks that regulate beef meat quality . Results Characteristics in meat quality and myofber The result related to meat quality were shown in Table 1 . Compared potential of hydrogen ( pH ) of longissimus dorsi from two varieties of cattle , pH value of LQC was significantly lower than LFC ( P < 0 . 0001 ) . As for the muscle color , the muscle lightness ( L * ) of LFC was sig - nificantly lower than that of LQC ( P < 0 . 05 ) , and the muscle redness ( a * ) of LFC was significantly higher than that of LQC ( P < 0 . 01 ) . It was no significantly differences between LFC and LQC on yellowness ( b * ) ( P > 0 . 05 ) . In the assessment of tenderness , tangential stress of LQC is lower than LFC ( P < 0 . 05 ) , that may preliminarily indicate that beef from LQC is more tender than that from LFN . Compared the longissimus dorsi fibers from two kinds of cattle ( Fig . 1 ) , in the same level viewing area , myofibers quantity of LQC was significantly more than that of LFC ( P < 0 . 05 ) . For the area and diameter of longissimus dorsi fibers , LQC has smaller myofibers area and smaller diam - eter compared with LFC ( P < 0 . 0001 ) . miRNA and transcriptome expression analysis miRNA - seq generated 24 , 041 , 508 row reads from 8 samples , and after filtering , 23 , 312 , 472 clean reads were Table 1 Longissimus dorsi muscle quality about Leiqiong cattle and Lufeng cattle Items Varieties of cattle P - value LQC LFC pH ( 24 h ) 5 . 66 ± 0 . 025 b 5 . 83 ± 0 . 032 a 0 . 000 L * 49 . 01 ± 3 . 937 a 40 . 01 ± 3 . 011 b 0 . 011 a * 15 . 35 ± 1 . 356 b 19 . 51 ± 1 . 234 a 0 . 004 b * 12 . 14 ± 0 . 494 11 . 64 ± 1 . 466 0 . 543 Tangential stress ( Pa ) 39 . 43 ± 14 . 228 b 65 . 26 ± 22 . 305 a 0 . 021 Cooking loss ( % ) 0 . 357 ± 0 . 008 0 . 343 ± 0 . 038 0 . 515 Fig . 1 Longissimus dorsi myofibers difference between Leiqiong cattle and Lufeng cattle : ( a ) Section of longissimus dorsi muscle of Lufeng cattle ; ( b ) Section of longissimus dorsi muscle of Leiqiong cattle ; ( c ) Density of longissimus dorsi myofibers between Lufeng cattle and Leiqiong cattle ; ( d ) Cross - sectional area of longissimus dorsi myofibers between Lufeng cattle and Leiqiong cattle ; ( e ) Diameter of longissimus dorsi myofibers between Lufeng cattle and Leiqiong cattle . * P < 0 . 05 , * * * * P < 0 . 0001 Page 3 of 12 Yang et al .

Compared with each other , there were 1 , 310 unique expressed circRNAs in LQC and 1 , 075 in LFC , 3 , 330 circRNAs were shared ( Fig . 3 ( c & d ) ) . PCA plot ( Fig . 3 ( e ) ) showed that obviously separation exist between the samples of LQC and the samples of LFC , indicating that there was a certain dif - ference in expression of circRNAs between the two types of cattle . Furthermore , differential expressed circRNAs ( DE cir - cRNAs ) between LQC and LFC were showed in Fig . 4 & Table S2 ( DEseq , Expression difference fold : | log2Fold - Change | > 1 , Significance : P - value < 0 . 05 ) . Compared to LQC , 19 circRNAs were up regulated and 10 were down regulated in LFC ( Fig . 4 ( a & c ) ) , and accounts for 65 . 5 % and 34 . 5 % of all DE circRNAs ( Fig . 4 ( b ) ) , respectively . Construction of ceRNA - networks and Enrichment analysis After screening the DE circRNAs , psRobot and miRanda databases were used to predict targeted miRNA . As the co - expression networks in Fig . 5 and Table S5 shown , 13 miRNA and 135 mRNAs were associated with 8 cir - cRNAs . Above them , there were 4 up - regulated and 4 down - regulated circRNAs , and influenced by them , 7 miRNAs and 35 mRNAs were up - regulated , and 6 miR - NAs and 100 mRNAs were down - regulated . GO and KEGG ( Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes ) enrichment analysis were performed on mRNAs that were indirectly influenced by circRNAs . As shown in Fig . 6 ( a & b ) and Table S6 , the top20 GO terms that targeted genes enriched in were mostly associated with Cellular Component and Biological Process . Further refinement , the top20 GO terms were closely related to peptidyl - tyrosine phosphorylation , peptidyl - tyrosine modification , regulation of peptidyl - tyrosine phosphory - lation , plasma membrane part , myelin sheath , intrinsic component of plasma membrane , external side of plasma membrane , integral component of plasma membrane , regulation of cytosolic calcium ion concentration , cellu - lar calcium ion homeostasis , myelination , ensheathment of neurons , axon ensheathment , calcium ion homeosta - sis , regulation of biological quality , positive regulation of cytosolic calcium ion concentration , cellular divalent inorganic cation homeostasis , regulation of midbrain dopaminergic neuron differentiation , regulation of planar cell polarity pathway involved in axis elongation , nega - tive regulation of planar cell polarity pathway involved in axis elongation and so on .

BMC Genomics ( 2023 ) 24 : 499 Enrichment analysis of sourcegene of circRNAs CircRNA is usually produced by exons or introns of their sourcegenes , and the cyclization of circRNA probably affects the expression of the sourcegene [ 21 ] . We ana - lyzed sourcegenes of 29 DE circRNAs from LQC and LFC , then KEGG and GO enrichment analysis were per - formed on them ( Fig . 7 ) . The result of top 25 GO terms in Fig . 7 ( a ) illustrate that most terms were enriched in Cellular Component and 6 terms were enriched in Bio - logical Progress . The information of all terms that were enriched have been stored in Table S8 , and it is worth noting that most of the enriched genes were associated with the function of myofibers , such as sarcomere , con - tractile fiber part , myofibril , contractile fiber , stress fiber , myosin complex , contractile actin filament bundle , actin filament bundle , actomyosin , muscle filament sliding , actin - myosin filament sliding and so on . Figure 7 ( b ) and Table S9 shown that top 25 KEGG Orthology of related genes , among them , there were 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 and 13 KEGG Orthology were classified to Cellular Processes , Envi - ronmental Information Processing , Genetic Information Processing , Human Diseases , Organismal Systems and Metabolism , respectively . In order to verify the reliability of the RNA sequenc - ing results , 3 circRNAs , 3 miRNAs and 8 mRNAs that differentially expressed in LQC and LFC were randomly selected and analyzed by RT - qPCR . The LQC served as a control group , RNA - seq and RT - qPCR results were consistent in the expression levels of each selected genes ( Figure S1 ) . Information about the primers used to amplify the selected genes has been placed in the Table S10 . Discussion Differences in meat quality between longissimus dorsi from LQC and LFC may be related to the differences in myofiber composition LFC and LQC are native Chinese cattle breeds , which have adapted to the hot and humid climate of south - ern China after long evolution ; therefore , it is impor - tant to enhance their meat value potential . Most of the indicators used for meat quality assessment , such as pH decline , meat color , and tenderness , are related to the structure and metabolism of the muscle fibers [ 22 , 23 ] . The rate of pH decline is often related to the amount of glycogen reserves in muscle tissue before slaughter and Fig . 4 DE circRNAs between Leiqiong cattle and Lufeng cattle : ( a ) Volcano plot for DE circRNA between two types of cattle ; ( b ) Ring diagram about the percentage of DE circRNAs between two types of cattle ; ( c ) Heatmap for DE circRNA between two types of cattle Page 6 of 12 Yang et al . BMC Genomics ( 2023 ) 24 : 499 the content of mitochondria in different muscle fibers . When the glycogen level in muscle tissue is low , the rate of glycolysis decreases ; therefore , the pH declines gradu - ally because of the slow accumulation of lactic acid [ 24 ] . Muscles with more oxidative properties had a higher pH than those with more glycolytic properties after the ani - mals were slaughtered [ 25 ] , and the meat with a higher percentage of fast - twitch glycolytic fibers has a higher rate and degree of pH decline , it is commonly known in the field of red muscle . Furthermore , the rate of glycoly - sis and rate of pH decrease can affect changes of some proteins in muscle fibers at the post - mortem , such as tropomyosin , actin , troponin , and some enzymes on glycolysis , and these protein changes will be directly reflected in meat tenderness , flavor substances , color , and other measures of meat quality [ 8 ] . Meat color is an important point in determining meat quality , and it is a marketability criterion of meat because consumers often use this criterion to select and buy meat . Previous studies [ 26 , 27 ] have shown that meat with low glycogen reserves tends to have higher ultimate pH , which leads to low light scattering and high oxygen consumption in meat surface , resulting in low lightness of the meat . The hue and chromaticity of meat color are primarily dominated by myoglobin ( Mb ) because the changes in the biochemical state of Mb cause the changes in meat color , particularly the degree of oxidation and reduc - tion of Mb . In addition , Mb in fresh meat is present in four states , namely , deoxymyoglobin , oxymyoglobin ( OxyMb ) , carboxymyoglobin ( COMb ) , and metmyoglo - bin , in which OxyMb and COMb provide the meat with a bright cherry red color that is typical of fresh meat [ 28 ] . However , the four redox states of Mb are not constant , and many meat - endogenous factors can affect the color of meat by influencing the state of Mb , of which pH , mus - cle source , presence of antioxidants , lipid oxidation , and mitochondrial activity and the most prominent [ 29 ] . Beef tenderness has received considerable attention because it affects the return decision and satisfaction of consum - ers . The characteristics of the muscle fibers largely affect the tenderness of the meat , although the tenderness and texture of beef are also affected by the connective tis - sue and intermuscular fat in the muscle [ 30 ] . The activ - ity of some protein hydrolytic enzymes changes with the Fig . 5 Identification of circRNA - associated ceRNA networks Page 7 of 12 Yang et al . BMC Genomics ( 2023 ) 24 : 499 decrease of the rate of pH , which leads to differences in glycogen metabolism by muscle fibers that indirectly affect meat tenderness [ 31 , 32 ] . In addition , the number of muscle fibers affect the tenderness of meat . In general , tender meat has more muscle fibers per unit area and a smaller diameter [ 33 ] . In the present study , the pH of the longissimus dorsi of LQC decreased faster than that of LFC , which may be one of the reasons for the high light - ness of the longissimus dorsi of LQC . With regard to redness , the longissimus dorsi of LFC has a higher level of redness than that of LQC , which may be due to some factors that keep the Mb more in the state of OxyMb or COMb in LFC . By analyzing the quantitative characteris - tics of myofibers per unit area , we found that the number of myofibers in LQC was less than that in LFC , and the diameter of myofibers was smaller . Such quantity charac - teristics of myofibers in LQC also confer a smaller shear force in LQC . ceRNA network points to the regulation of PI3K - Akt , MAPK , and calcium pathways Considering that muscle fibers profoundly influence meat quality , the regulatory mechanism of myogenesis has been discussed comprehensively and extensively . Myogenesis is a physiological process that is influenced by various internal or external factors starting from fetal life . Among the factors , circRNA as a ncRNA has received considerable attention for its wide range of reg - ulatory functions . circRNAs are dynamically expressed and abundant in muscle tissue of many species , including Fig . 7 GO and KEGG enrichment analysis for sourcegenes of DE circRNAs : ( a ) Top25 GO terms function enrichment for sourcegenes of DE circRNAs ; ( b ) Top25 KEGG Orthologys function enrichment for sourcegenes of DE circRNAs Fig . 6 GO and KEGG enrichment analysis for mRNAs that were influenced by circRNAs - targeted - miRNAs : ( a ) Bubble chart of Top20 GO terms for targeted genes related to DE circRNAs ; ( b ) Bar plot of GO enrichment terms in BP , CC , and MF categories for targeted genes related to DE circRNAs ; ( c ) Bubble chart of Top20 KEGG Orthologys for targeted genes related to DE circRNAs ; ( d ) Bar plot of KEGG enrichment pathways for targeted genes related to DE circRNAs Page 8 of 12 Yang et al . BMC Genomics ( 2023 ) 24 : 499 humans , cattle , goat , pig , chicken , and mice [ 9 ] . Although the functions of circRNAs remain largely unexplored , they can serve as miRNA sponges and further contrib - ute to mRNA stability or protein production [ 34 ] . For example , circPTPN4 can sponge miR - 499 - 3p , which regulates NAMPT expression , thereby promoting myo - blast proliferation and differentiation and activating the fast - twitch muscle phenotype [ 35 ] . The overexpression of circCPE counteracts the inhibitory effect of miR - 138 on cell proliferation and the accelerating effect on dif - ferentiation and apoptosis , and circRNAs can reduce the inhibitory effect of miR - 138 on FOSC1 , which is involved in myogenesis [ 36 ] . With the continuous improvement of sequencing technology and database , the construction of a ceRNA network has become an important tool for pre - dicting circRNA function . Therefore , we performed Pear - son correlation analysis to assess the association between DE circRNA and DE mRNA that exist between LQC and LFC , and enrichment analysis was performed for tar - get mRNAs . Based on the results of KEGG analysis , we found that target mRNAs were primarily related to PI3K - Akt , MAPK , and calcium signaling pathways . PI3K - Akt has been widely proven to be associated with muscle hypertrophy and atrophy [ 37 – 40 ] . Several recent studies have also demonstrated the ability of circRNA to regulate the PI3K / AKT pathway , for example , the newly identified circRILPL1 as miR - 145 sponge promotes myogenic cell growth by regulating the expression of the IGF1R gene to reduce the inhibitory effect of miR - 145 on the PI3K / AKT signaling pathway [ 41 ] . The proliferation and differentia - tion of bovine myoblasts can be inhibited by circMEF2D , and circMEF2D can regulate the PI3K - AKT signaling pathway by competitively binding miR - 486 [ 42 ] . Previ - ous studies suggest that MAPK may be associated with myoblast cell cycle arrest , which is critical for initiating muscle differentiation in myogenic cells [ 43 ] . In addition , MAPK is a signaling pathway that drives the metabolic adaptation of skeletal muscle to exercise [ 44 ] . Numerous studies have shown that MAPK increases insulin - depen - dent glucose uptake and oxidative metabolism as well as mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in muscle dur - ing exercise [ 44 – 47 ] . In muscle tissue , intracellular stores of Ca 2 + , upon release , trigger the formation of actin crossbeams and the generation of contractile force [ 48 ] . Myocytes can sense and respond to changes in workload and activation patterns by regulating the gene expression and cellular metabolism of calcium signaling pathways [ 49 , 50 ] . Stored calcium influx has become a mecha - nism by which the calcium signaling pathway is activated in response to the changing demands of myocytes [ 48 , 51 ] . Most of the target mRNAs identified by the ceRNA network using LQC and LFC longissimus dorsi were enriched in pathways related to muscle metabolism and myogenesis . Therefore , these mRNA - related circRNAs and miRNAs might be effective tools for regulating mus - cle production and development . Cyclization of btacirc _ 00497 and btacirc _ 034497 may affect myogenesis Apart from being a sponge for miRNA , circRNA can compete with linear splicing to play a functional role in gene regulation [ 15 ] . In this study , we attempted to use GO and KEGG enrichment analyses to organize and predict the function of genes that were affected by and were the source of DE circRNA . Based on the results of enrichment analysis , MYH6 , MYH7 , and nebulin ( NEB ) have high frequency in multiple pathways and GO terms that may associate with myogenesis and meat quality . Myosin is a motor protein that plays an important role in the contraction of animal skeletal muscle . Myosin con - sists of six subunits , two of which are myosin heavy chain ( MyHC ) subunits . MyHC isoforms play an irreplaceable role in muscle contraction because they have ATPase activity , which provides energy for muscle contraction [ 22 ] . In mammals , 11 known genes can encode MyHC , and these genes are highly conserved during evolution [ 52 ] . The four MyHC isoforms , namely , I , IIa , IIx , and IIb , are classified by different coding genes , which leads to four myofiber types . MyHC I is expressed in type I fibers , and IIa , IIx , and IIb are expressed in IIA , IIX , and IIB fiber types , respectively [ 53 , 54 ] . The two subunits of the MyHC I heavy chain are composed of β - cardiac and α - cardiac encoded by MYH7 and MYH6 , respectively [ 55 ] . Theoretically , the high expression level of MyHC I indicates that muscle fiber metabolism will have less efficient glycolysis , resulting in less lactate accumula - tion [ 56 ] . Low levels of lactic acid in the muscle tissue of live cattle can lead to a gradual decrease in beef pH rate postmortem [ 24 ] . Insufficient pH reduction in beef impairs meat color , tenderness , and shelf life [ 57 ] . Many studies have shown that feeding high - energy diet before slaughter is an effective way to increase muscle glycogen content and improve muscle pH reduction after slaugh - ter , and this strategy may not become dependent on muscle fibers that have high MyHC I expression level [ 58 , 59 ] . In our study , btacirc _ 00497 in LFC longissimus dorsi has a high expression level , which is sourced from MYH6 and MYH7 . However , our findings on the meat quality of LQC and LFC do not support our conjecture , that is , circRNA reduces β - MHC and α - MHC expres - sion by competing for linear shearing of the transcripts of MYH6 and MYH7 and further influences the meta - bolic process of MyHC . We hypothesize that the expres - sion level of MYH6 and MYH7 transcripts of LFC may be higher than that of LQC , so the probability of cycli - zation to btacirc _ 00497 is also increased . Thus , although the factors affecting the cyclization of btacirc _ 00497 are unclear , this gene may still serve as a potential lynchpin Page 9 of 12 Yang et al . BMC Genomics ( 2023 ) 24 : 499 for the regulation of muscle fiber types . In addition , we identified btacirc _ 034497 , which shares the same origin gene as NEB . Actin is present and functionally impor - tant in most eukaryotic cells , and the control of actin filament organization and structure is critical for many cellular functions . NEB stabilizes actin filaments in thin filament architecture , thereby regulating the filament length [ 60 , 61 ] . Moreover , NEB regulates skeletal muscle contraction in skeletal muscle , and muscles from NEB knockout mice produce significantly less force than their wild - type siblings [ 62 , 63 ] . Therefore , the factors affecting btacirc _ 034497 cyclization have great application poten - tial as important tools for NEB regulation . Materials and methods Sample collection All experimental animals were sourced from the breeding farm ( Meixian Country , Meizhou City , Guangdong prov - ince ) . Four Leiqiong cattle ( LQC ) and four Lufeng cattle ( LFC ) each , four - month - old , were humanely slaughtered , and the cattle of the same breed are similar in weight and body condition and raised in the same farm environ - ment . Then longissimus dorsi tissues from 8 cattle were collected and snap - frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately to extract total RNA . Another portion of the longissimus dorsi tissue was trimmed into 0 . 5 × 0 . 5 × 1 . 0 cm pieces and immediately fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde for observa - tion in tissue sections . In addition , any anesthesia or euthanizing agent was not used in our study . Analysis of muscle quality properties After 24 hours of slaughter , pH was determined using Meat pH Meter HI99163 ( HANNA , Italy ) on the longis - simus dorsi . The colorimetric parameters of the muscles were calculated using the L * a * b * system with a col - orimeter OPTO - STAR Meat Color Tester ( Matthaus , Germany ) from the average of three random readings of each sample . And the evaluation of steaming losses was performed according to the project of Honikel [ 64 ] . Dur - ing the shear force measurement , three samples of the longissimus dorsi after 72 hours of aging of each cattle ( 1cm × 1cm × 3cm ) were measured three times perpen - dicular to the fiber direction . The final shear force was the average of the three readings , and the measurements were expressed in Pascal ( Pa ) [ 65 ] . Muscle fiber characteristics The tissues were after fixing by 4 % paraformaldehyde for 24h , and then immersed in xylene alcohol ( 1 : 1 , v / v ) , infil - trated and embedded in paraffin . Cross sections of 3µm thickness were prepared , stained with hematoxylin and eosin , observed under a microscope , and photographed ( 400 × magnification ) . The number of muscle fibers and total cross - sectional area were subsequently evaluated with Image - Pro Plus V6 . 0 ( Media Cybernetics Inc . , Rock - ville , MD , USA ) . Preparation and sequencing for RNA - seq TRIzol ( Thermo Fisher , Shanghai , China ) used to extract total RNA from the tissue samples . RNA quantity and purity were determined using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and the RNA 6000 Nano Labchip Kit ( Agilent , Santa Clara , USA ) . Epicentre Ribo - Zero™rRNA Removal Kit ( Epicentre , America ) were used to remove rRNA before the RNA - seq library construction . Then , the rRNA - depleted RNAs were then fragmented and reverse - tran - scribed to obtain cDNA libraries using the TruseqTM RNA sample prep Kit ( Illumina , America ) . Small RNA - seq library construction was performed according to the instructions of NEBNext Multiplex Small RNA library Prep ( Illumina , America ) , which was followed by TRIzol extraction . Then , the library was amplified and enriched using PCR technique , proprietary indexed adapters were then ligated to 5 ʹ - and 3 ʹ - termini , and later electropho - resed using 15 % concentration of agarose gel to obtain the target fragments . Finally , all sequenced libraries were sent to the sequencing company ( Personalbio , Shanghai , China ) and sequenced by Illumina Hiseq4000 platform for paired - end sequencing after quality control . Bioinformatics Primary Analysis The reference genome used in this experiment was Bos taurus ftp : ( ftp . ensembl . org / pub / release - 101 / fasta / bos _ taurus / dna ) . For miRNA , Hiseq Single - End mode sequencing data were mapped between reference genome sequences after quality control using miRDeep2 [ 66 ] software . The mature miRNA and precursor sequences of the species miRNAs were downloaded from miRbase ( https : / / www . mirbase . org / ) . Then the de - duplicated sequences were mapped and annotate . Sequences that were not annotated with any information were analyzed using mireap ( http : / / sourceforge . net / projects / mireap ) . DESeq V1 . 18 . 0 [ 67 ] was performed to analyze miRNAs for differential expression and filtered by | log2Fold - Change | > 1 and P - value < 0 . 05 to filter out differentially conserved miRNAs . For the circRNA and mRNA , downstream data were used for initial evaluation of row data using FastQC v0 . 11 . 9 software after RNA - seq was completed . Cut - adapt v2 . 6 was used to filter lower quality data as well as adepters . The obtained clean data were used for the subsequent analysis of circRNA and mRNA . During the analysis of mRNA , the upgraded HISAT2 ( http : / / ccb . jhu . edu / software / hisat2 / index . shtml ) software of TopHat2 was used to map reads with reference genes . The differ - entially expressed transcripts were analyzed using DEseq , and the differentially expressed genes were screened for | log2FoldChange | > 1 , P - value < 0 . 05 . During the Page 10 of 12 Yang et al . BMC Genomics ( 2023 ) 24 : 499 circRNA prediction analysis , the 20 bp of two ends of the reads that were not matched on the HISAT2 were realignment and used as Anchors . Ffind _ circ [ 68 ] was used for circRNA identification . CircRNA expression was analyzed for differential expression , and the screened standard was | log2FoldChange | > 1 and P - value < 0 . 05 . GO ( Gene Ontology ) and KEGG ( Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes ) enrichment analysis [ 69 – 71 ] were performed using DAVID ( https : / / david . ncifcrf . gov / ) . In addition , miRNA targeting relationships to circRNA and mRNA were predicted using miRanda and psRobot software . RT - qPCR validation After obtained sequencing results , RNA was extracted from the longissimus dorsi tissue using TRIzol ( Thermo Fisher , Shanghai , China ) . RNA was reverse - transcribed to cDNA using the method provided in the introduc - tions of PrimeScript RT Reagent Kit - Prefect Real Time ( Takara , Beijing , China ) for validation of mRNA and cir - cRNA . miRNA 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit ( by stem - loop ) ( Vazyme , Nanjing , China ) was used for miRNA reverse transcription . 2 × Ultra SYBR Green qPCR Mix ( CISTRO , Shanghai , China ) was used for RT - qPCR in an Applied Biosystems QuantStudio 5 ( Thermo Fisher , Shanghai , China ) . The reaction mixture containing , reac - tion conditions and primer sequences for the RT - qPCR validation procedure are stored in Table S10 . The results were statistically analyzed using the 2 - ΔΔCT method [ 72 ] . All data are expressed as the average of 4 independent experiments . Statistical analysis The comparative analysis of two groups was performed using unpaired independent t - test . SPSS 25 . 0 ( SPSS Inc . , Chicago , IL ) and GraphPad prism 9 was used for statis - tical analyses . Results were considered statistically sig - nificant differences at P < 0 . 05 and were expressed as the mean ± Standard Deviation unless otherwise stated . Conclusions In this study , we found that the pH drop and brightness of beef from LQC were significantly higher than those from LFC . In addition , the small cross - sectional area and diameter of muscle fibers produced better tenderness for beef from LQC . However , LFC was found to have supe - rior redness compared with LQC . Furthermore , we iden - tified several circRNAs related to muscle production and metabolism by ceRNA network building and analysis . By analyzing the source genes of DE circRNAs , we found that btacirc _ 00497 and btacirc _ 034497 may regulate the expression of MYH6 , MYH7 , and NEB by competing for linear shear , thereby altering the muscle fiber struc - ture . Therefore , the ceRNA network - related genes and circRNA - derived genes identified in this study could be used as tools for regulating muscle production and meat quality of cattle grown in a subtropical environment .
