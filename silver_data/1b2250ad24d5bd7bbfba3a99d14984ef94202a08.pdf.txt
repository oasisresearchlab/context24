Although some chaperone proteins play an essential role in CME ( e . g . Hsc70 in clathrin uncoating ) , relatively few of these proteins are functionally involved in CIE . We previously revealed a role for the mitochondrial chaperone protein GRP75 in heparan sulfate pro - teoglycan ( HSPG ) - mediated , membrane raft - associated macromolecule endocytosis . However , the me - chanism underlying this process remains unclear . In this study , using a mitochondrial signal peptide - directed protein traf ﬁ cking expression strategy , we demonstrate that wild - type GRP75 expression en - hanced the uptakes of HSPG and CIE marker cholera toxin B subunit but impaired the uptake of CME marker transferrin . The endocytosis regulation function of GRP75 is largely mediated by its subcellular location in mitochondria and is essentially determined by its ATPase domain . Interestingly , the mi - tochondrial expression of GRP75 or its ATPase domain signi ﬁ cantly stimulates increases in both RhoA and Cdc42 activation , remarkably induces stress ﬁ bers and enhances ﬁ lopodia formation , which col - lectively results in the promotion of CIE , but the inhibition of CME . Furthermore , silencing of Cdc42 or RhoA impaired the ability of GRP75 overexpression to increase CIE . Therefore , these results suggest that endocytosis vesicle enrichment of GRP75 by mitochondria traf ﬁ cking upregulates CIE through an actin cytoskeleton reorganization mechanism mediated by the concurrent activation of Cdc42 and RhoA .

Introduction Endocytosis is an essential cellular process that is used by cells to internalize a diverse array of cargo molecules . Numerous cel - lular processes , including those of microbial invasion , nutrient uptake , membrane receptor traf ﬁ cking , cell motility and macro - molecular drug delivery , are modulated by endocytosis through several distinct mechanisms . Although the exact de ﬁ nition of these mechanisms is still debated , a speci ﬁ ed cargo molecule can be taken up by mammalian cells through clathrin - mediated en - docytosis ( CME ) or clathrin - independent endocytosis ( CIE ) . In comparison with the well - de ﬁ ned CME pathway , a more com - prehensive understanding of CIE pathways based on their asso - ciations with / dependence on dynamin , caveolin - 1 , ﬂ otillin , Arf6 or the Rac1 , RhoA , and Cdc42 Rho GTPase family has been achieved in recent years [ 1 ] . Interestingly , almost all CIE pathways appear to be triggered by and dependent on the actin cytoskeleton re - organization machinery because endocytosis through such path - ways is sensitive to agents that inhibit actin ﬁ lament polymerization .

Experimental Cell Research 343 ( 2016 ) 223 – 236 been recognized to prevent aberrant protein aggregation by fa - cilitating the assembly / disassembly and folding / refolding of cy - toskeletal proteins [ 2 ] . Nonetheless , some chaperone proteins , particularly member of the Hsp70 family , not only facilitate cy - toskeletal structure remodeling in abnormal situations , but also play speci ﬁ c roles under normal conditions to regulate a variety of cell endocytosis activities . For instance , the cytoplasmic Hsp70 protein ( Hsc70 / HspA8 ) is widely known to drive multiple phases of CME and in particular catalyzes the disassembly of clathrin cages together with co - chaperones like auxilin ( DnaJC6 ) or GAK ( Cyclin G - associated kinase / DnaJC28 ) [ 3 ] . The endoplasmic re - ticulum Hsp70 protein ( BiP / Grp78 / HspA5 ) has frequently been reported to function as a cell surface - binding receptor or co - re - ceptor for the endocytosis of several viruses and matrix proteins , a process that is always mediated by caveolae or lipid rafts [ 4 – 6 ] . The mitochondrial Hsp70 protein ( Grp75 / Mortalin / HspA9 ) has been shown to bind directly or associate with certain cytokine or cytokine receptors thereby mediating their intracellular traf ﬁ cking or endocytosis [ 7 , 8 ] , typically via RhoA - dependent CIE routes . Thus , it appears that Hsp70 chaperone proteins play an active role in different endocytosis pathways depending on their speci ﬁ c in - tracellular localizations . Various macromolecules , viruses and ligand complexes enter cells via cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan ( HSPG ) - medi - ated endocytosis , which involves the use of a glycosyl - phospha - tidyl - inositol ( GPI ) - linked glypican ( GPC ) or transmembrane syn - decan ( SDC ) as the initial docking receptor . We previously pro - vided the ﬁ rst demonstration that mitochondrial chaperone pro - tein GRP75 is enriched as a functional constituent in HSPG - mediated and membrane raft - associated endocytosis vesicles . Notably , the role of GRP75 in this clathrin - independent but Rho GTPase Cdc42 - dependent endocytosis pathway has been revealed through the use of RNAi - mediated knock - down method [ 9 ] . GRP75 , a multifunctional heat shock protein 70 , plays an essential role in the importing , sorting and refolding of mitochondrial ma - trix proteins [ 10 ] . Its trans - localization to outside the mitochon - dria results in its collaboration with a repertoire of binding part - ners while playing an expansive cellular role . For example , cyto - solic GRP75 has been isolated as a protein that binds to endocytic FGF - 1 [ 7 ] , associates with IL - 1 receptor type I ( IL - 1R1 ) [ 8 ] , and co - localizes with mannose receptor ( MR ) [ 11 ] . All of these interac - tions have been believed to facilitate intracellular traf ﬁ cking and / or signaling cascades . Moreover , cell surfaces associated with GRP75 have been found to bind components of C5b - 9 complexes while promoting the shedding or uptake of membrane vesicles loaded with complement MAC ( membrane attack complex ) . In - terestingly , the cytosolic overexpression of Δ S GRP75 ( lacking the 51 N ‐ terminal amino acids corresponding to the mitochondrial targeting sequence ) exhibits limited protective capacities against CDC ( complement - dependent cytotoxicity ) relative to that of mi - tochondrial GRP75 . Furthermore , although GRP75 interactions with complement proteins C8 and C9 have been determined based on the ATPase domain ( ATPaseD ) , this is not its substrate - binding domain ( SBD ) [ 12 ] . For the HSPG - mediated and membrane raft - associated uptake of macromolecules , is the regulation function of GRP75 in endocytosis affected by its subcellular location ? Which domain of the GRP75 protein determines its regulatory function ? What is the speci ﬁ c relationship between GRP75 and Cdc42 acti - vation in this pathway ? Are other Rho GTPases also involved ? Is the actin cytoskeletal organization affected by the subcellular distribution of GRP75 ? All of these questions remain to be clari ﬁ ed . In this study , using a signal peptide - directed protein ectopic expression approach , we found that the mitochondrial expression of GRP75 , mainly through its ATPaseD , signi ﬁ cantly promoted CIE while simultaneously inhibiting CME . The expression of GRP75 or ATPaseD in mitochondria induces the concurrent downstream activation of RhoA and Cdc42 , and thereby enhances the formation of stress ﬁ bers and ﬁ lopodia , effects that contributed collectively to the promotion of CIE and the inhibition of CME . Together , our results provide the ﬁ rst demonstration that GRP75 subcellular translocation / traf ﬁ cking / enrichment upregulates CIE through an actin cytoskeleton reorganization mechanism mediated by the concurrent activation of Cdc42 and RhoA . 2 .

( B ) HeLa cells were transiently transfected with the EGFP recombinant plasmids listed above . Forty - eight hours after transfection , the cell lysates were analyzed through SDS - PAGE followed by western blotting with rabbit anti - GFP Ab ( 1 : 2000 ) and mouse anti - GRP75 Ab ( 1 : 1000 ) respectively . ( C ) The HeLa cells transfected with the listed plasmids were ﬁ rst stained with MitoTrcker ( 300 nM ) for 10 min at 37 ° C for mitochondria labeling ( red color ) . After ﬁ xation and permeabilization , untransfected cells ( leftmost image in up row ) were sequentially stained with mouse anti - GRP75 ( 1 : 100 ) and thenwith anti - mouse AF488 ( 1 : 1000 , green color ) ; Plasmids - transfected cells were sequentially stained with rabbit anti - GFPAb ( 1 : 1000 ) and thenwith anti - rabbit AF488 ( 1 : 1000 ) .

Chen et al . / Experimental Cell Research 343 ( 2016 ) 223 – 236 225 ( v / v ) CO 2 . The cells were transient - transfected with EGFP - fused plasmids ( pEGFP as control ) and / or transfected with GRP75 / Cdc42 / RhoA speci ﬁ c siRNA oligo pool ( scrambled siRNA as control ) for 6 h using Lipofectamine s 2000 or RNAiMAX , then reseeded and were cultured for 48 – 72 h before analysis . For the ﬂ ow cyto - metry and confocal ﬂ uorescence assays , 0 . 3 μ g of plasmid DNA was added to each well in a 48 - well plate or chamber slide , unless otherwise stated . For the co - immunoprecipitation and Cdc42 / RhoA / Rac1 activation assays , 5 μ g of plasmid DNA was used for each 100 mm dish . For the RNA interference ( RNAi ) assay , 100 nM ( ﬁ nal concentration ) siRNA pool was used in each transfection . Both the overexpression and knock - down ef ﬁ ciency were assessed by western blotting . For the actin polymerization inhibition assay , the dose of actin perturbants was carefully titrated to ful ﬁ ll sig - ni ﬁ cant inhibition of CIE marker Cholera toxin B subunit ( CTxB ) but not on CME marker transferrin ( Tfn ) . Cells were treated with Lat A ( 5 μ M ) or carrier ( dimethyl sulphoxide ) for a period of 5 min at 37 ° C prior to the analysis of endo cytic capacity . 2 . 4 . Western blotting and immunoprecipitation Cells were washed with cold PBS and then lysed in standard lysis buffer ( 50 mM Tris – HCl , pH 8 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 % NP - 40 , 0 . 5 % sodium deoxycholate and 0 . 1 % SDS ) . Cell debris was removed via centrifugation at 13 , 000 rpm for 10 min and protein concentration of the lysate was measured using the BCA assay . Protein samples were resolved by SDS - PAGE , blotted onto PVDF membranes and then analyzed with different Abs as noted in the text . For the immunoprecipitation experiments , the cells were washed with cold PBS and then lysed in IP lysis buffer ( 10 mM Tris , pH 7 . 4 , 140 mM NaCl , 5 mM EDTA , 25 mM NaF , 10 mM sodium pyropho - sphate , and 1 % NP - 40 freshly supplemented with 1 mM sodium orthovanadate , 5 mM sodium glycerophosphate and one complete tablet / 50 ml ) . The cell lysate ( 200 μ g total proteins ) were pre - cleared for 1 h with Dynabeads s protein G , incubated with 2 μ g of Ab overnight at 4 ° C , and then incubated with Dynabeads s protein G for an additional 1 h of incubation . The beads were washed four times with IP lysis buffer before being loaded onto gels . 2 . 5 . Flow cytometry The transfected cells were serum - free starved for 30 min , then live cells based ﬂ ow cytometry was used to check the binding and uptake of α HS ( 1 : 20 ) , CTxB ( 10 m g / ml ) and Tfn ( 25 m g / ml ) . For the binding experiments , the cells were ﬁ rst detached using PBS ( 2 (cid:2) ) / 0 . 5 mM EDTA , washed twice with PBS BSA ( 1 % w / v ) and incubated with α HS , then washed in PBS BSA and incubated with mouse anti - VSV Ab ( 1 : 500 ) , followed by rinsing in PBS BSA and incuba - tion with goat anti - mouse - AF647 Ab ( 1 : 200 ) . All binding incuba - tions with three ligands were performed for 30 min on ice . Finally , cells were washed in PBS BSA and analyzed immediately on FACSCalibur instrument integrated with Cell - Quest software . For the uptake experiments , α HS , mouse anti - VSV ( 1 : 500 ) and goat anti - mouse - AF647 Ab were pre - complexed in serum - free medium at 20 ° C for 30 min ( α HS - AF647 complex ) , then incubated with cells at 37 ° C for 1 h ( 30 min incubation for CTxB - AF647 , and 15 min incubation for Tfn - AF647 ) . Cells were then trypsinized , suspended in cold DMEM 10 % FBS , washed with cold PBS BSA and analyzed immediately by ﬂ ow cytometry . Controls without α HS primary Ab were included in all experiments . In some experiments , the cells were co - transfected with EGFP recombinant plasmids and siRNA pools , then cultured for another 48 h for reversing the overexpression of GRP75 . The binding and uptake of α HS - AF647 complex , CTxB - AF647 and Tfn - AF647 were determined by live cells - based ﬂ ow cytometry through gating of EGFP expressing and – nonexpressing ( or – low expressing ) cells . In the case of combined treatments with Cdc42 dominant - active overexpression or Cdc42 RNAi followed by GRP75 overexpression or its RNAi , the uptakes were compared in transfected cells only with mono - treatment . 2 . 6 . Confocal microscopy and image analysis The transfected cells were re - seeded in chamber slides , serum - free starved for 30 min , and then incubated with α HS - AF647 complex , CTxB - AF647 and Trfn - AF647 for 10 – 30 min at 37 ° C . The cells were then rinsed three times with PBS supplemented with 1 M NaCl to remove surface - associated ligands and ﬁ xed in 3 . 7 % ( w / v ) paraformaldehyde for 10 min A DAPI ( 1 : 1000 ) nuclear stain was performed after cell - permeabilization with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 . The cells were mounted , observed and images were acquired using Olympus FV 1000 laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with 63 (cid:2) / 1 . 4N . A . and 100 (cid:2) / 1 . 44N . A . oil immersion lens . Sixteen - bit z - series of confocal sections ( step size ¼ 0 . 42 m m for 63 (cid:2) objective and 0 . 29 m m for 100 (cid:2) objective ) were acquired in the photon - counting mode , and these acquisition parameters were kept identical across all samples . For image presentation , eight - bit maximal projections of the z - series were created using ImageJ software , and brightness was adjusted across the entire image using Volocity software . For quanti ﬁ cation of the uptakes of α HS - AF647 complex , CTxB - AF647 and Trfn - AF647 in cells , raw 16 - bit z - series were ﬁ rst con - verted to sum slice projections , which represent the total sum value of the integrated ﬂ uorescence intensities of the entire z - series , using ImageJ . Individual cells were next outlined as re - gions of interest ( ROIs ) , and the total integrated ﬂ uorescence in - tensities ( I cell ) were measured using Volocity software . The mean intensity of an ROI outside of the cell was also measured to serve as background intensity ( I back ) , and the relative ﬂ uorescence in - tensity ( I rel ) was calculated ( I rel ¼ [ I cell – I back / A back * A c ell ] / A cell , where A represents the pixel area of the ROI ) . Resultant data was nor - malized against the average values of control samples . It was empirically determined that the cells with the 15 % highest and lowest ﬂ uorescence intensities reliably represented mechanically broken or dead cells , respectively , so these cells were excluded from the analyses . For each experiment , at least 30 cells in total were analyzed . For staining of mitochondria and EGFP fused protein expres - sion , the transfected cells were incubated ﬁ rst with MitoTracker s Red CMXRos ( 300 nM ) in a complete medium at 37 ° C for 10 min , then ﬁ xed with 3 . 7 % ( w / v ) paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 followed by sequential staining with rabbit anti - GFP Ab and anti - rabbit - Alexa Fluor 488 Ab . To stain the actin cytoskeleton , transfected cells were re - seeded in poly - D - lysine ( 100 m g / ml ) pre - coated chamber slides , serum - free starved , then ﬁ xed in 3 . 7 % ( w / v ) paraformaldehyde for 10 min and permeabi - lized with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 . Polymerized actin was stained with Rhodamine - conjugated phalloidin ( 100 nM ) for 45 min at room temperature . Isotype - matched control IgG was included in all experiments . 2 . 7 . Cdc42 / RhoA / Rac1 activation assay Assays were created following the GST - RBD ( Rho - binding do - mains ) pull - down method [ 17 ] . In brief , GST - TRBD ( Rhotekin RBD ) and GST - PAK CRIB proteins were produced by expression in E . coli BL21 DE3plys and BL21 cells , respectively . GST fusion proteins were puri ﬁ ed and loaded on Glutathione Sepharose ™ 4B accord - ing to the manufacturer ' s instruction . Serum - starved cells growing on a six - well plate were scraped with ice - cold Lysis buffer B ( for Rac1 and Cdc42 activation ) or Lysis buffer C ( for RhoA activation ) and centrifuged for the removal of cell debris . One milliliter of H . Chen et al . / Experimental Cell Research 343 ( 2016 ) 223 – 236 226 beads pre - cleared cell lysate was then incubated with 20 m g of GST - PAK - CRIB beads ( for Cdc42 / Rac activation ) or GST - Rhotekin - RBD beads ( for RhoA activation ) for 60 min at 4 ° C . The beads were washed four times with Tris wash buffer B . The beads pellets were boiled for 5 min in 50 m l of SDS - PAGE sample buffer . Samples were run in parallel with total cell lysate and immunoblotted with Abs for the appropriate small GTPase ( rabbit anti - Cdc42 Ab , 1 : 250 ; mouse anti - RhoA Ab , 1 : 250 ; rabbit anti - Rac1 Ab , 1 : 200 ) using the ECL detection method . The activation of Cdc42 , RhoA and Rac1 ( GTP - bound state ) in the control and transfected cells was de - termined by densitometry , and total lysates were used for nor - malization of the total quantity of small GTPase protein . 2 . 8 . Statistical analyses Microscopy , ﬂ ow cytometry and western blotting data were derived from at least three independent experiments . All of the data obtained from the experiments were analyzed and are pre - sented as the mean 7 SEM . For two - sample comparisons against the controls , unpaired Student ' s t - tests were used unless other - wise noted . One - way analysis of variance with a Dunnett ' s mul - tiple comparison was used to evaluate the statistical signi ﬁ cance of at least three groups of samples . Graphs were created using GraphPad Prism 5 software . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . Expression of GRP75 and its limited - domain plasmids with / without signal peptides Endogenous GRP75 proteins , which include mitochondrial - targeting signal peptides within their precursors , are generally localized in mitochondria . However , recent advances reveal that GRP75 serve distinct function from the related heat shock proteins ( HSPs ) , and it can be actively translocated to other cellular loca - tions and assume novel functions controlling signaling , prolifera - tion , invasion , apoptosis , in ﬂ ammation and immunity [ 9 , 10 , 18 ] . To mimic the subcellular translocation of GRP75 protein and to fur - ther explore whether differences in its distribution affect the en - docytosis of macromolecules , we ﬁ rst constructed GRP75 and its limited - domain plasmids with / without signal peptides ( Figs . 1A and S1 ) and then examined their subcellular locations in HeLa cells following expression . Western blot analyses showed that all EGFP recombinant plasmids were expressed with the correct - size pro - ducts based on the predicted molecular weights in cell lysates ( Fig . 1B ) . No signi ﬁ cant differences in fusion protein expression levels were detected between the mitochondrial signal peptides containing plasmids and the corresponding mitochondrial signal peptides lacking plasmids ( wtGRP75 vs Δ SGRP75 , ATPaseD vs Δ SATPaseD , and SBD vs Δ SSBD ) ( Fig . 1B ) . To determine whether the EGFP fusion GRP75 or its limited - domain plasmids were ex - pressed in the mitochondria , all transfected HeLa cells were la - beled using MitoTracker Red . Confocal microscope analyses re - vealed substantial quantities of expressed wtGRP75 in mitochon - dria ( Fig . 1C ) . In contrast , the absence of a mitochondria - targeting sequence in Δ SGRP75 led to its protein expression evenly dis - tributed throughout the cytoplasm rather than in mitochondria ( Fig . 1C ) . This considerable difference in subcellular distribution patterns was also found for the expression of limited - domain construct pairs ( ATPaseD vs Δ SATPaseD , SBD vs Δ SSBD ; Fig . 1C ) . These results indicate that mitochondria - targeting signal peptides essentially direct the enrichment / traf ﬁ cking of expressed GRP75 or its limited - domains and determine their ﬁ nal subcellular loca - tions in mitochondria . 3 . 2 . GRP75 promotes clathrin - independent endocytosis but inhibits clathrin - mediated endocytosis To explore the functional role of GRP75 in endocytosis pathway , HeLa cells were transfected with increasing concentrations of wtGRP75 plasmid and were then treated with a GRP75 siRNA pool ( Fig . 2A ) . After the incubations with α HS - AF647 complex , CME marker Tfn - AF647 and membrane raft marker CTxB - AF647 , ﬂ ow cytometry and confocal microscope analyses of the EGFP - positive cells showed that wtGRP75 expression increased the uptake of α HS - AF647 complex ( average increments of 10 – 110 % and 10 – 140 % were obtained in the FCM and confocal analyses , respectively ) and CTxB - AF647 ( average increments of 15 – 135 % and 40 – 160 % were obtained in the FCM and confocal analyses , respectively ) but lim - ited the uptake of Tfn - AF647 ( average decrements 8 – 45 % and 10 – 40 % were obtained in the FCM and confocal analyses , respectively ) in a concentration - dependent manner ( Figs . 2C and S2B ) . Notably , the expression - concentration - dependent uptake of α HS - AF647 complex and CTxB - AF647 was completely reversed by GRP75 - targeting RNAi ( Figs . 2C and S2B ) . No signi ﬁ cant changes in the α HS - AF647 complex , Tfn - AF647 and CTxB - AF647 binding proper - ties were observed after the expression or knock - down of wtGRP75 ( Figs . 2D , E , F and S2C ) . These results show that GRP75 expression promotes the uptake of α HS and CTxB but reduces the uptake of Tfn , complementing our previous observations [ 9 ] and strongly suggesting that GRP75 conversely regulates CIE and CME . 3 . 3 . GRP75 promotes clathrin - independent endocytosis through its ATPase domain Similar to other proteins in the Hsp70 chaperone family , GRP75 has two functional domains , an N - terminal ATPaseD and a C - terminal SBD , which are joined by a protease - sensitive site [ 10 ] . In principle , ATPaseDs of Hsp70 proteins are preserved , and ex - ertion of their chaperone activity requires ATP hydrolysis , whereas SBDs show more signi ﬁ cant sequence variations , leading to di - versi ﬁ cation of client proteins and substrate speci ﬁ cities . To ex - amine which domain of GRP75 , i . e . , the ATPaseD or SBD , de - termines its regulation activity , HeLa cells were transfected with wtGRP75 , ATPaseD and SBD plasmids , and the uptake patterns of α HS - AF647 complex , Tfn - AF647 and CTxB - AF647 were then compared . Compared with wtGRP75 , ATPaseD expression alone showed a similar capacity to increase the uptake of α HS - AF647 and CTxB - AF647 ( Figs . 2D , E , 3B , C , S3A and S3B ) but inhibited Tfn - AF647 uptake ( Figs . 2F , 3D and S3C ) . In contrast , the patterns ob - tained by SBD transfection revealed a discrepancy between the FCM and confocal results : SBD expression only resulted in α HS - AF647 uptake inhibition ( Figs . 2D , 3B and S3A ) but had different effects on CTxB - AF647 and Tfn - AF647 uptake ( Figs . 2E , F , 3C , D , S3B and S3C ) . Again , no binding changes in any of the macro - molecules listed above were observed among these transfections ( Figs . 2D , E , F and S2C ) . Thus , the role of GRP75 in the promotion of α HS and CTxB uptake and in the inhibition of Tfn uptake is likely determined by the ATPaseD domain , but not by the SBD domain . 3 . 4 . The lack of mitochondrial signal peptides compromises the en - docytosis regulation activities of GRP75 The impact of the subcellular distributions ( inside or outside of mitochondria ) of GRP75 on its endocytosis regulation was then examined . Plasmid - transfected HeLa cells were subjected to test for analyzing the uptake of the indicated macromolecules . The expression of full - length wtGRP75 markedly increased the uptake of α HS - AF647 complex ( average increases of 190 % and of 180 % were obtained with the FCM and confocal results , respectively ) , increased the uptake of CTxB - AF647 ( average increases of 210 % H . Chen et al . / Experimental Cell Research 343 ( 2016 ) 223 – 236 227 and of 195 % were obtained with the FCM and confocal results , respectively ) but decreased the uptake of Tfn - AF647 ( average de - creases of 53 % and 56 % were obtained with the FCM and confocal results , respectively ) ( Figs . 2D , E , F , 3B , C and D ) . In contrast , Δ SGRP75 expression only slightly increased the uptake level of α HS - AF647 complex ( average increases of 130 % and 115 % were obtained with the FCM and confocal results , respectively ) and CTxB - AF647 ( average increases of 135 % and 120 % were obtained Fig . 2 . Flow cytometry analysis of the uptake of α HS macromolecular complex with reference to the CIE marker CTxB and the CME marker Tfn in transfected cells . HeLa cells were ﬁ rst transfected with concentration - increased wtGRP75 plasmids following by GRP75 - targeting RNAi ( A , B , C ) , or transfected with the indicated plasmids as shown in Fig . 1 ( A ) ( D , E , F ) . The transfected cells were serum - starved for 30 min and then incubated with α HS - AF647 complex , Tfn - AF647 and CTxB - AF647 respectively on ice for binding - measurement after PBS / EDTA detachment , or incubated with these drugs at 37 ° C for uptake - measurement after trypsinization . The cells were collected , rinsed and immediately analyzed alive via FACS . The expression levels of endogenous and EGFP fused - GRP75 proteins after transfection with increasing concentrations of wtGRP75 plasmids following RNAi were checked simultaneously via western blotting ( A ) . Representative images of serial two - dimensional density plots obtained from three in - dependent experiments are shown in ( B ) . The uptake levels of α HS - AF647 complex , Tfn - AF647 and CTxB - AF647 in the transfected cells ( validated by EGFP ﬂ uoresce , FL - 1 ) were measured ( FL - 4 ) and are quanti ﬁ ed in ( C ) . The uptake and binding levels of these drugs in various transfections were measured and quanti ﬁ ed as shown in ( D ) , ( E ) and ( F ) , respectively . The data collected include the following : means 7 SEM ( error bars ) , n ¼ 3 , Z 10000 EGFP positive cells counted per sample , and triplicate samples per transfection for each experiment . Statistically signi ﬁ cant differences in comparison with the concentration - increased ( C ) or with the titer matched ( D , E , F ) pEGFP control are shown : * * P o 0 . 01 , * P o 0 . 05 . H . Chen et al . / Experimental Cell Research 343 ( 2016 ) 223 – 236 228 with the FCM and confocal results , respectively ) ( Figs . 2D , E , 3B and C ) but did not signi ﬁ cantly decrease the Tfn - AF647 uptake levels ( Figs . 2F and 3D ) . Similar differences in the effects on α HS - AF647 and CTxB - AF647 uptake were also observed between AT - PaseD and Δ S ATPaseD expression ( Figs . 2D , E , 3B and C ) . How - ever , no signi ﬁ cant differences in the changes of α HS - AF647 complex , CTxB - AF647 and Tfn - AF647 uptake were found between SBD and Δ S SBD expression ( Figs . 2D , E , F , 3B , C and D ) . Therefore , cells expressing Δ S GRP75 or Δ S ATPasD that lacked mitochon - drial targeting sequences exhibited compromised uptakes of macromolecular ligands compared with cells transfected with wtGRP75 or ATPaseD , suggesting that GRP75 traf ﬁ cking through mitochondria is essential to endocytosis regulation . 3 . 5 . Not only Cdc42 but also Rho A are activated by the expression of GRP75 or the ATPase domain It was found early on that GRP75 is bound with and involved in IL - 1R1 internalization [ 8 ] , and interleukin receptors are usually internalized via the RhoA - dependent CIE route [ 19 , 20 ] . Moreover , Fig . 3 . Confocal analysis of α HS macromolecular complex uptake with reference to the CIE marker CTxB and CME marker Tfn . HeLa cells were transfected with EGFP fused GRP75 plasmids and serum - starved as described above , then were respectively incubated in α HS AO4B08 - AF647 complex , Tfn - AF647 , and CTxB - AF647 at 37 ° C . The cells were rinsed with PBS / 1M NaCl , ﬁ xed and then visualized via confocal microscopy . Images are maximal projections of a z - series of ﬂ uorescence confocal slices through the entire cell volume . Representative images for three independent experiments are shown in ( A ) . Scale bar , 20 m m . The α HS - AF647 complex , CTxB - AF647 and Tfn - AF647 uptake levels in EGFP recombinant plasmid - transfected cells in comparison with the pEGFP control levels are quanti ﬁ ed in ( B ) , ( C ) and ( D ) , respectively . Uptake percentages are correspondingly corrected by the expression levels of EGFP recombinant proteins . The data collected include the following : means 7 SEM ( error bars ) , n ¼ 3 , Z 30 EGFP positive cells counted per transfection in each experiment . Statistically signi ﬁ cant differences in relation to the pEGFP control are shown : * * P o 0 . 01 , * P o 0 . 05 . H . Chen et al . / Experimental Cell Research 343 ( 2016 ) 223 – 236 229 we previously showed that GRP75 is associated with α HS uptake - induced Cdc42 activation and that the α HS uptake levels are re - duced by half ( compared with wtCdc42 transfection ) in dominant - negative Cdc42 ( T17N ) - expressing cells [ 9 ] . To fully determine the role of GRP75 in Rho GTPase activation , HeLa cells were trans - fected with plasmids as noted above or with GRP75 - targeting RNAi pool , and the activation levels of RhoA , Cdc42 and Rac1 were simultaneously compared . GRP75 knock - down by RNAi decreased the Cdc42 and RhoA activation levels to 55 % and 35 % , respectively , on average ( Fig . 4A ) . In contrast , wtGRP75 expression induced nearly three times the increment in Cdc42 and RhoA activations . However , Δ S GRP75 expression did not induce any Cdc42 activa - tion but a little increment in RhoA activation ( Fig . 4B and C ) . Compared with transfection with full - length GRP75 , the expres - sion of ATPaseD increased the Cdc42 and RhoA activation levels to 410 % and 300 % , respectively , on average , whereas the expression of SBD or Δ S SBD reduced their activation levels to 70 % or 40 % and 45 % or 20 % , respectively , on average . It is noteworthy that Δ S ATPaseD expression did not signi ﬁ cantly induce the activation of Cdc42 and RhoA ( Fig . 4B and C ) . In addition , no Rac1 activation processes were detected after transfection of any of the indicated plasmids ( data not shown here ) . Taken together , these results show that the expression of GRP75 , particularly ATPaseD , stimulates both RhoA and Cdc42 activation , whereas GRP75 knock - down and SBD expression limit RhoA and Cdc42 activation . 3 . 6 . GRP75 acts upstream from Cdc42 and RhoA activation to reg - ulate clathrin - independent endocytosis Though we previously found a fraction of co - localization be - tween α HS and GRP75 in endo cytic vesicles and co - localization between endocytic α HS and ectopically expressed Cdc42 [ 9 ] , the relationship between GRP75 and Cdc42 had not been examined directly . Analyses of transfected HeLa cells conducted using a confocal microscope strikingly revealed variant co - localization patterns between endogenous GRP75 and ectopically expressed wtCdc42 , Cdc42 ( G12V ) activated mutant , Cdc42 ( T17N ) domi - nant - negative mutant ( Fig . S4A ) . Activated mutant Cdc42 ( G12V ) was predominantly co - localized with endogenous GRP75 on tub - ular mitochondria structures . Only a small fraction of wtCdc42 was clearly co - localized with endogenous GRP75 in mitochondria of the perinuclear area . In contrast , dominant - negative Cdc42 ( T17N ) mutant was seldom co - localized with endogenous GRP75 ( Fig . S4A ) . However , such results were not found in the co - im - munoprecipitation of activated mutant Cdc42 by EGFP - GRP75 ( Fig . S4C ) . In addition , we did not ﬁ nd interaction binding between Fig . 4 . The expression of wtGRP75 and ATPaseD stimulates RhoA and Cdc42 activation . HeLa cells were transfected with ( A ) GRP75 - targeting siRNA pool or scramble siRNA , ( B , C ) EGFP - fused GRP75 plasmids with / without mitochondrial - targeting signal peptide and were serum - starved for 16 h , then the fractions of activated Cdc42 and RhoA were measured via GST pull down method as described in Section 2 . Prime Abs with mouse anti - GRP75 ( 1 : 1000 ) , rabbit anti - Cdc42 ( 1 : 200 ) , mouse anti - RhoA ( 1 : 250 ) , rabbit anti - b - actin ( 1 : 2000 ) , and rabbit anti - GFP ( 1 : 2000 ) were respectively used for western blotting . Four independent experiments were performed and representative blot pictures for each of these experiments are shown in the left . The graphs shown in the right present the results from the quantitative analysis of the Cdc42 and RhoA activation levels determined via densitometry . Percentage changes were correspondingly corrected by the expression levels of EGFP - fused proteins . The data collected include the following : means 7 SEM ( error bars ) , n ¼ 4 . Statistically signi ﬁ cant differences in relation to the appropriate controls ( scramble siRNA or pEGFP ) are shown : * * P o 0 . 01 . H . Chen et al . / Experimental Cell Research 343 ( 2016 ) 223 – 236 230 activated RhoA ( EGF stimulated ) and endogenous GRP75 in co - pulldown assay ( Fig . S4B ) . To fully explore the relationship between GRP75 and Cdc42 / RhoA in the CIE pathway , HeLa cells were transfected with Cdc42 / RhoA siRNA pool and then subjected to GRP75 overexpression or knock - down ( Figs . 5A , C and 6 ) , or were transfected with Cdc42 ( G12V ) activated mutant and then subjected to GRP75 over - expression or knock - down ( Fig . 5B ) . Flow cytometry and confocal microscope analyses showed that Cdc42 and RhoA knock - down signi ﬁ cantly decreased α HS - AF647 complex uptake ( Fig . 5D , S7 ) , whereas Cdc42 ( G12V ) activated mutant expression markedly in - creased α HS - AF647 complex uptake ( Figs . 5D , E and F ) . The de - crease in the uptake of α HS - AF647 complex induced by Cdc42 or RhoA knock - down was aggravated by GRP75 knock - down , whereas wtGRP75 expression completely reversed this effect ( Fig . 5D ) . In contrast , increased α HS - AF647 complex uptake in - duced by Cdc42 activated mutant was synergistically promoted by wtGRP75 expression ( Fig . 5F ) . However , this increase in α HS - AF647 complex uptake was not signi ﬁ cantly affected by GRP75 knock - down ( Fig . 5D , E and F ) . Similar changes in α HS - AF647 uptake were observed after combined modulation of the expres - sion of GRP75 and Cdc42 or the expression of GRP75 and RhoA ( Fig . S5 ) . In addition , simultaneous knock - down of Cdc42 and RhoA abrogated the effect of GRP75 expression on uptake pro - motions of aHS complex and CTxb ( Fig . 6 ) . Compared with the results in Fig . 5 ( D ) , a compensatory relationship between Cdc42 Fig . 5 . GRP75 acts upstream from RhoA and Cdc42 activation in CIE regulation . HeLa cells were transfected ﬁ rst with Cdc42 - targeting siRNA pool ( A ) , Cdc42 ( G12V ) activated mutant ( CA - Cdc42 ) ( B ) , or RhoA - targeting siRNA pool ( C ) respectively , and then followed with GRP75 plasmid overexpression ( w GRP75 OE ) or with its RNAi knock - down ( w GRP75 RNAi ) or without further treatments ( wo ) . Negative controls are scramble siRNA transfection followed by the pEGFP transfection ( A , C ) , or the pCMV5 transfection followed by scramble siRNA & pEGFP transfection ( B ) . The corresponding cell lysates were analyzed via western blotting using mouse anti - GRP75 Ab ( 1 : 1000 ) , rabbit anti - Cdc42 Ab ( 1 : 200 ) , mouse anti - RhoA Ab ( 1 : 250 ) and rabbit anti - FLAG Ab ( 1 : 2000 ) . The α HS - AF647 uptake in the transfected cells based on staining using corresponding Ab combinations was measured by ﬂ ow cytometry ( D ) and confocal microscopy ( E ) as described in Section 2 . Rabbit anti - GRP75 ( 1 : 100 ) , goat anti - FLAG ( 1 : 100 ) , anti - rabbit Ab - AF488 ( 1 : 1000 ) and anti - goat Ab - AF546 ( 1 : 1000 ) were used together in co - staining to determine the overexpression / interference levels of GRP75 and / or Cdc42 . The α HS - AF647 uptakes values for the different treatments relative to the control levels ( Lipo 2000 or Lipo RNAiMAX ) are quanti ﬁ ed in ( D ) and ( F ) . The data used include the following : means 7 SEM ( error bars ) , n ¼ 3 , with Z 10000 cells counted per sample in the ﬂ ow cytometry experiments and with Z 30 targeted cells ( arrows , GRP75 OE . arrowhead , GRP75 RNAi ) counted per transfection in the confocal experiments . Scale bar , 20 m m . Statistically signi ﬁ cant differences in relation to the respective controls are shown : * * P o 0 . 01 . H . Chen et al . / Experimental Cell Research 343 ( 2016 ) 223 – 236 231 and RhoA may exist in GRP75 mediated endocytosis regulation . All these results indicated that neither Cdc42 nor RhoA binds directly to GRP75 , and that concurrent RhoA and Cdc42 activation con - stitute downstream signaling events in GRP75 - regulated CIE pathways . 3 . 7 . Expression of GRP75 and its ATPase domain induce actin cy - toskeleton reorganization Because members of Rho GTPase have long been known to be extensively involved in endocytosis regulation and in controlling cytoskeleton dynamics [ 21 ] , we further examined the effects of GRP75 and its limited - domain plasmids expression on actin cy - toskeleton organization via phalloidin - Rhodamine labeling . HeLa cells transfected with the control pEGFP plasmid were elongated with few actin micro ﬁ lament bundles forming thin peripheral bands and fewer stress ﬁ bers , whereas wtGRP75 - and ATPaseD - transfected cells were polygonal with increased polymerized actin forming a wider cortical actin layer of high stress ﬁ ber accumu - lation ( Fig . 7A , arrowheads , Fig . 7D ) and numerous ﬁ lopodia ( Fig . 7A , arrows , Fig . 7B ) . The ﬁ lopodia in the ATPaseD expressing cells were signi ﬁ cantly shorter than those found after wtGRP75 transfection ( Fig . 7A , arrows ) . In contrast , Δ SGRP75 - and Δ SAT - PaseD - transfected cells showed intermediate levels of cortical actin ﬁ lament accumulation ( Fig . 7A , arrowheads , Fig . 7D ) but rarely showed ﬁ lopodia ( Fig . 7B ) . As shown in Fig . 7C , lamellipodia formation ( asterisk ) was largely absent after all construct trans - fections and was only observed in Δ S GRP75 - transfected cells . It is noteworthy that little or no formation of stress ﬁ bers , ﬁ lopodia and lamellipodia was observed in the SBD - and Δ S SBD - trans - fected cells ( Fig . 7B , C and D ) . These results show that GRP75 or ATPaseD expression primarily results in enhanced stress ﬁ ber formation and signi ﬁ cantly increases ﬁ lopodia presentation , strongly suggesting remarkable actin cytoskeletal reorganization . Most CIE pathways share virtually the same molecular ma - chinery ( particularly actin cytoskeleton system ) to affect actual endocytic processes [ 1 ] . To examine whether the promotion of CIE induced by GRP75 was because of enhanced actin dynamics , we used pharmacological inhibitor of actin polymerization . Although variable effects on CME inhibition had been observed when actin polymerization inhibitors were used at higher concentration or for longer incubation times [ 20 ] , we found 5 min incubation with Lat A at 5 μ M could reach a distinct CIE inhibition in HeLa cells ( Fig . S6 ) . Treatment of wtGRP75 - transfected HeLa cells with Lat A markedly blocked the uptake of aHS complex and CTxb to a similar extent , at both 1 h ( data not shown ) as well as 30 min , while the uptake of Tfn ( at 15 min ) was relatively unaffected ( Fig . 7E , F and G ) ; Similar to the perturbation on wtGRP75 - induced endocytosis , Fig . 6 . Simultaneous knock - down of Cdc42 and RhoA abrogate the effect of GRP75 overexpression on CIE promotion . HeLa cells were reverse - transfected with Cdc42 - targeting siRNA pool for 6 h ﬁ rst , then forward - transfected with RhoA RNAi pool for 6 h after 8 h growth . The double transient - transfected cells were digested and reseeded with reverse - transfection of wtGRP75 plasmid ( w GRP75 OE ) or GRP75 RNAi pool ( w GRP75 RNAi ) overnight , or without further treatments ( WO ) . Negative controls are transfections with scramble siRNA pools followed by GRP75 overexpression or RNAi . The ef ﬁ ciency of knockdown and overexpression of interest proteins were checked ( rabbit anti - Cdc42 , 1 : 200 ; mouse anti - RhoA , mouse anti - GRP75 , 1 : 1000 ; 1 : 250 , rabbit anti - GFP , 1 : 2000 , and rabbitanti - b - actin , 1 : 2000 ) and representative results of western blotting are shown ( A ) . The uptakes values of α HS - AF647 complex , CTxB - AF647 and Tfn - AF647 for different treatments relative to the control levels are quanti ﬁ ed in ( B , C , D ) . The data used include the following : means 7 SEM ( error bars ) , n ¼ 3 , with Z 10000 cells counted per sample in ﬂ ow cytometry experiments . Statistically signi ﬁ cant differences in relation to the control are shown : * * P o 0 . 01 . H . Chen et al . / Experimental Cell Research 343 ( 2016 ) 223 – 236 232 treatment of Δ S GRP75 - transfected cells with Lat A also decreased the uptake of aHS complex and CTxb but did not affect Tfn uptake ( Fig . 7E , F and G ) , indicating that the effects of actin perturbation on CIE may be more severe than that on CME . These results de - monstrated that the CIE promotion by GRP75 is strongly modu - lated by the dynamic status of the actin cytoskeleton . 4 . Discussion Although the reduction in the dynamic traf ﬁ cking of mi - tochondrial protein into endocytic vesicles is dif ﬁ cult to realize , signal peptide - directed protein subcellular transport based on overexpression methodology can be feasibly employed to mimic the enrichment process and thereby uncover gain - of - function properties . In the present study , we demonstrate that the uptake of HSPG - dependent macromolecular complex occurs through CIE pathway mediated by the concurrent downstream activation of RhoA and Cdc42 GTPases , which are regulated by upstream GRP75 . This endocytosis regulation is largely mediated by the subcellular location of GRP75 protein in mitochondria and is essentially de - termined by the ATPaseD characteristics . The overexpression of GRP75 or its ATPaseD in mitochondria stimulates RhoA and Cdc42 activation and enhances the formation of stress ﬁ bers and ﬁ lopodia , collectively resulting in the promotion of CIE but the inhibition of CME . GRP75 , which is mainly found in mitochondria , is a 679 - amino - acids - long , heat - uninducible member of the Hsp70 protein family . In general , HSP70 heat shock proteins bind to unfolded proteins via their C - terminal SBD , and their chaperone activities require ATP hydrolysis executed by their N - terminal ATPaseD [ 10 ] . In the chaperone / Tom70 system of mitochondrial protein delivery , the ATPase hydrolysis cycling of a multichaperone complex ( including Hsp90 and Hsp70 ) drives preproteins transfer from the mi - tochondrial Tom70 complex through the import pore to the TIM ( inner membrane import machinery ) [ 22 ] . Although speci ﬁ c mo - lecules binding to GRP75 during the CIE process have not yet been identi ﬁ ed , in this study , we show that the ATPaseD , similarly to intact GRP75 , but not the SBD , promotes α HS and CTxB uptakes but inhibits Tfn uptake ( Figs . 2D , E , F and 3 ) . These results are in line with two previous ﬁ ndings : 1 ) HSP90 - mediated intercellular vesicle transport , VSVG traf ﬁ cking between Golgi stacks is de - pendent on the ATPaseD of HSP90 ; and 2 ) in immune attacked cells , the caveolin - and dynamin - dependent endocytosis of MAC is regulated by GRP75 through its ATPaseD but not through SBD [ 12 ] . All of these results reveal the decisive contributions of ATPaseD to the endocytosis regulation function of GRP75 . No studies have previously shown any functional connection Fig . 7 . The expression of wtGRP75 and ATPaseD induces actin cytoskeleton reorganization and the inhibition of actin polymerization blocks CIE . HeLa cells were transfected with indicated plasmids as shown in Fig . 1 , reseeded in poly - D - lysine pre - coated chamber slides , serum - free starved , then were ﬁ xed , permeabilized and co - stained with rabbit anti - GFP Ab ( 1 : 1000 , followed by anti - rabbit Ab - AF488 ) and Rhodamine - conjugated phalloidin ( 100 nM ) for detection of polymerized actin . Representative confocal images for three independent co - staining experiments are shown in ( A ) . Scale bar , 20 m m . Morphometric analyses of the extent of ﬁ lopodia , lamellipodia and stress ﬁ ber formation in the transfected cells are shown in ( B ) , ( C ) and ( D ) , respectively . The transfected cells starved in parallel were subjected to Lat A treatment before the ﬂ ow cytometry based uptake - checking of indicated macromolecular drugs as described in Section 2 . The uptake levels of α HS - AF647 complex , Tfn - AF647 and CTxB - AF647 in transfected cells are respectively quanti ﬁ ed in ( E ) , ( F ) and ( G ) , expressed relative to that measured in un - transfected cells ( value setting to 1 ) . The data used include the following : means 7 SEM ( error bars ) , n ¼ 3 , with 4 60 cells counted per transfection in confocal experiments and Z 10000 cells counted per sample in ﬂ ow cytometry experiments . Statistically signi ﬁ cant differences in relation to the respective controls are shown : * * P o 0 . 01 , * P o 0 . 05 . H . Chen et al . / Experimental Cell Research 343 ( 2016 ) 223 – 236 233 between an HSP70 chaperone and Rho GTPase . The protein that may be related ( with only referential signi ﬁ cance ) was HSP90 , which contributes to protein traf ﬁ cking by forming a complex with GDI to direct the intracellular recycling of Rab GTPase [ 23 ] . In this study , we found that GRP75 expression signi ﬁ cantly stimu - lates RhoA and Cdc42 activation , whereas GRP75 knock - down limits their activation ( Fig . 4 ) . Furthermore , we found that GRP75 acts upstream of the concurrent activation of RhoA and Cdc42 in this CIE pathway ( Figs . 5 , 6 ) . To the best of our knowledge , this study provides the ﬁ rst demonstration that the HSP70 chaperone acts as an upstream regulator of Rho GTPase . Whether the me - chanism underlying the effects of GRP75 on RhoA and Cdc42 ac - tivation is similar to that involved in the Hsp90 regulation of GDI - dependent Rab recycling ( i . e . , via binding with Rho GDI ) remains to be elucidated further . Strikingly , an unexpected ﬁ nding of the present study is that both RhoA and Cdc42 are concurrently acti - vated by wtGRP75 expression ( Fig . 4 ) . Although speci ﬁ c require - ments for a given CIE pathway have not been rigorously estab - lished , an increasing body of evidence suggests that RhoA activa - tion serves as the driving machinery behind the uptake of cytokine receptors and that Cdc42 activation serves as the driving ma - chinery behind the endocytosis of CTxB and GPI - APs [ 19 ] . Because glypicans form GPI - APs on the cell surface and GRP75 is involved in IL receptors internalization and α HS - F complex uptake [ 8 , 9 ] , the concurrent activation of RhoA and Cdc42 by wtGRP75 expression found in the present study is reasonable . In addition , it is note - worthy that , similarly to Cdc42 knock - down , RhoA knock - down also signi ﬁ cantly decreased the uptake of α HS - F complex ( Fig . 5D ) . Therefore , cell surface GPI - APs crosslinked by α HS Ab ( AO4B08 ) may have been internalized by mixed CIE pathways . We previously reported that endogenous GRP75 is markedly enriched in endo cytic vesicles while being localized on the HeLa cell surface [ 9 ] . In this study , we showed that the main fraction of expressed wtGRP75 becomes trans - localized into the mitochon - drial membrane structure ( Fig . 1C ) . These observations are con - sistent with previous observations that 70 - kDa HSPs ( including GRP75 ) are selectively localized in detergent - resistant membrane fractions in several tissue cells [ 24 – 28 ] , thus suggesting that GRP75 - membrane enrichment or cell surface translocation may exist to maintain the stability of lipid raft - associated structures . GPI - APs , including glypicans , are always found on the cell surface in cholesterol - enriched nanoscale clusters . These clusters have been found to act as sorting platform for the selective uptake of GPI - APs via Cdc42 - activation dependent CIE pathway [ 29 ] . In ad - dition , most Rho GTPases are usually recruited and activated by the Dbl family GEFs ( guanine nucleotide exchange factors ) posi - tioned very close to cell membranes , and post - translational modi ﬁ cations ( e . g . , protein prenylation or palmitoylation ) often enhance their bindings with certain components in cell membrane while determining their localization in speci ﬁ c membrane com - partments [ 21 ] . When considering these facts together , it is logical to assume the presence of intermolecular interaction or binding between GRP75 , HSPG ( glypican in particular ) and Cdc42 on cell surfaces or in endo cytic vesicles . However , only small levels of co - localization between GRP75 and HSPG and between GRP75 and Rho GTPase were observed in the confocal assays [ 9 ] . Co - locali - zation between GRP75 and the lipid raft marker CTxB and mole - cular interactions between GRP75 and Rho GTPase or HSPG have not been found in any of our previous studies [ 9 ] ( Figs . 3 , 5 , S2 and S4 ) . In contrast , after translocation to the cell surface , another member of the HSP70 protein family , GRP78 , which is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum , was frequently found to act as a binding receptor for the lipid raft - or caveolae - dependent endocytosis of coxsackievirus A9 , dengue virus serotype 2 , acti - vated 2 - macroglobulin and dentin matrix proteins [ 4 – 6 ] . It is widely recognized that HSPG serves as a co - receptor for these types of viruses , and chondroitin sulfate chains are known to at - tach to bone dentin matrix proteins [ 30 ] . It was shown early on that Hsp70s are prone to binding to hydrophobic or basic residues - enriched peptides [ 31 ] , and the endocytosis ligand used in this study , AO4B08 α HS Ab ( 2 - O - sulfation HS epitope ) , also showed such characteristic sequence [ 16 ] . In addition , HSP70 protein was recently found to preferentially bind to and form a complex with heparan sulfate , which often contains 2 - O - sulfated iduronic acid residue [ 32 ] . All of these ﬁ ndings encourage us to adopt novel methodologies for identifying speci ﬁ c binders to GRP75 in endocytosis . Although several chaperones have been suggested to regulate the cytoskeleton system , the only one that has been validated and that is known to be involved in membrane traf ﬁ cking is HSP27 . HSP27 has been found to exhibit increasing F - actin concentrations in the CHO cell cortex , and its overexpression enhances pinocy - tosis [ 33 ] . Its role on the induction of actin polymerization was further found to accompany decelerated Tfn endocytosis in CCL39 cells [ 34 ] and enhanced exosome uptake in HUVEC cells [ 35 ] . In the present study , we provide the ﬁ rst demonstration that ex - pression of GRP75 and its ATPaseD enhances stress ﬁ ber formation and thereby increase the quantities of ﬁ lopodia in HeLa cells ( Fig . 7 ) . These enhanced actin polymerizations occur alongside the promotion of uptake of α HS and CTxB and the inhibition of Tfn uptake ( Figs . 2 , 3 and S3 ) . These results indicate that in compar - ison with HSP27 , GRP75 exerts a similar effect on stabilizing the assembly of the actin cytoskeleton while playing a major role in endocytosis regulation . In fact , Hsp27 is an actin - binding protein that is frequently co - localized with F - actin in non - stimulated neutrophils [ 36 ] . However , we did not observe such co - localization between GRP75 and F - actin ( Fig . 7 ) . In general , actin plays multiple roles in endocytosis modulation by facilitating membrane de - formation and vesicle movement within the cells . Founding members of the GTPase Rho family ( RhoA , Cdc42 and Rac1 ) , when activated , always interact with downstream effectors that collec - tively trigger actin cytoskeleton reorganization , which is further maintained by dynamic Rho GTPase activation near the membrane structure [ 21 , 29 , 37 ] . Thus , it is logical to deduce from the present results that the expression of GRP75 or of its ATPaseD in mi - tochondria stimulates RhoA and Cdc42 concurrent activation , in turn enhancing actin cytoskeleton reorganization and upregulat - ing CIE ( Fig . 8 ) . Notably , the present results differ from previous ﬁ ndings , which demonstrated that another chaperone protein , Hsp90 , downregulates Rho GTPase activity [ 38 ] while mainly fa - cilitating Rab - GTPase recycling [ 23 ] . Because HSP70 and HSP90 play different but cooperative roles in cytoskeleton assembly and RhoGEF activity maintenance [ 39 , 40 ] and because bioinformatics methods predict that many components of the endocytosis path - way may serve as downstream targets of Hsp90 [ 41 ] , it is naturally speculated that GRP75 may function in or interact physically with some unknown factors ( e . g . , DBL GEF family members ) , potentially resulting in the concurrent activation of both RhoA and Cdc42 in CIE ( Fig . 8 ) . This hypothesis is currently being investigated in our laboratory . In summary , this study shows that GRP75 induces concurrent downstream activation of RhoA and Cdc42 , enhances the forma - tion of stress ﬁ bers and ﬁ lopodia , and promotes CIE but inhibit CME . All of these processes are mediated by its mitochondrial lo - cation and ATPase domain . The present results strongly suggest that GRP75 subcellular translocation / traf ﬁ cking / enrichment up - regulates CIE through actin cytoskeleton reorganization mechan - isms mediated by the concurrent activation of Cdc42 and RhoA . These ﬁ ndings serve as an essential step toward understanding complex chaperone signaling in the regulation of cell endocytosis pathways and toward uncovering a potentially useful macro - molecular delivery route in cells .
