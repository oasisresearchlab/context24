REVIEW Dynamin 2 and human diseases Anne - Cécile Durieux & Bernard Prudhon & Pascale Guicheney & Marc Bitoun Received : 2 November 2009 / Revised : 21 December 2009 / Accepted : 25 December 2009 / Published online : 3 February 2010 # Springer - Verlag 2010 Abstract Dynamin 2 ( DNM2 ) mutations cause autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy , a rare form of congen - ital myopathy , and intermediate and axonal forms of Charcot – Marie - Tooth disease , a peripheral neuropathy . DNM2 is a large GTPase mainly involved in membrane trafficking through its function in the formation and release of nascent vesicles from biological membranes . DNM2 participates in clathrin - dependent and clathrin - independent endocytosis and intracellular membrane trafficking ( from endosomes and Golgi apparatus ) . Recent studies have also implicated DNM2 in exocytosis . DNM2 belongs to the machinery responsible for the formation of vesicles and regulates the cytoskeleton providing intracellular vesicle transport . In addition , DNM2 tightly interacts with and is involved in the regulation of actin and microtubule net - works , independent from membrane trafficking processes . We summarize here the molecular , biochemical , and functional data on DNM2 and discuss the possible pathophysiological mechanisms via which DNM2 muta - tions can lead to two distinct neuromuscular disorders .

The importance of DNM2 was emphasized in 2005 with the demonstration of DNM2 gene mutations causing two distinct human diseases [ 2 , 3 ] . Our purpose is to review the molecular and functional data on DNM2 to highlight the pathophysiological hypotheses in DNM2 - related diseases . Knowledge of the dynamins mainly comes from studies of the neuronal dynamin 1 ( DNM1 ) . However , we have focused this review on DNM2 since several studies have demonstrated notable differences between DNM1 and DNM2 [ 4 – 7 ] . A . - C . Durieux : B . Prudhon : M .

A human homologue was thereafter identified by screening of a fibroblast library [ 9 ] . The human transcript ( 3 . 6 kilobases ) is ubiquitously expressed , with higher abundance in heart and skeletal muscle [ 9 ] . Human DNM2 is encoded by the DNM2 gene located on the short arm of chromosome 19 ( 19p13 . 2 ) . The gene is composed of 22 exons in a 114 - kilobase region . Four major isoforms are expressed by the DNM2 gene using a combination of two alternative splice sites ( Fig . 1a ) . Exons 10 and 10bis have the same length ( 139 base pairs encoding the amino acids 399 – 445 in the middle domain ) and are alternatively spliced . In addition , the exon 13bis ( 12 - base pair length ) can be spliced leading to the translation of proteins of 866 or 870 amino acids ( Fig . 1 ) without or with the GEIL sequence at position 516 – 519 in the C - terminal part of the middle domain ( MD ) . The four major isoforms have been shown to be expressed in a panel of rat tissues including brain , heart , kidney , liver , lung , pancreas , and testis [ 10 ] . The human tissue expression pattern is unknown , but we have shown expression of the four isoforms in skeletal muscle and peripheral nerve [ 11 ] .

Asterisks indicate the seven exons in which disease - associated mutations have been identified . Exons were colored relative to the encoded protein domain illustrated in ( b ) . The combination of the two alternative splice sites leads to the translation of four DNM2 isoforms . Isoforms 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 are also known as isoforms aa , ba , ab , and bb , respectively . b Schematic representation of DNM2 showing the five protein domains and the position of the 19 disease - associated mutations . CMT - mutations are indicated in green and CNM - mutations in red . The two regions of variation ( at positions 399 - 445 and 516 - 519 ) between the four isoforms were indicated in the MD by black lines . In black are indicated the sites of post - translational modifications ( phosphorylation , nitrosylation , and cathepsin L cleav - age ) . The CMT - mutation G358R is located in the cathepsin L cleavage site . In blue are indicated the DNM2 constructs with point mutations or small deletions overexpressed in vitro [ 60 ] . Insert in b : Position of the CNM - and CMT - mutations on the 3D structure of the PH domain ( accession number 63660 in the NCBI 3D structure database ) . The N - terminal part of the domain , bearing CMT - mutations and only one CNM mutation , is composed of β - sheets involved in the interaction with membrane phosphoinositides 340 J Mol Med ( 2010 ) 88 : 339 – 350 Specific functions of these isoforms will be discussed below . DNM2 structure and regulation The 98 kDa DNM2 is a large GTPase composed of a N - terminal GTPase domain , an MD , a pleckstrin homology domain ( PH ) , a GTPase effector domain ( GED ) , and a C - terminal proline rich domain ( PRD ; Fig . 1b ) . The catalytic GTPase domain is responsible for GTP binding and hydrolysis , whereas the MD is involved in DNM2 self - assembly [ 12 ] and in GTP hydrolysis - induced conforma - tional change of the protein [ 13 ] . The PH domain interacts with membrane phosphoinositides and therefore is involved in the targeting of dynamin to membranes [ 14 ] . The DNM2 - PH domain displays phosphoinositide binding affinity following the order : PI4 , 5P2 ≈ PI3 , 4 , 5P3 ≈ PI3 , 4P2 > PI4P ≈ PI3P , and DNM2 oligomerization appears crucial for high affinity [ 15 ] . The GED probably participates in the self - assembly of DNM2 and acts as a GTPase - activating protein [ 16 ] . The PRD contains multiple Src homology 3 ( SH3 ) binding motifs and mediates multiple protein – protein inter - actions ( Table 1 ) . A general model of dynamin intramolec - ular interaction was proposed , in which the GTPase domain , MD and GED interact to drive self - assembly and the PH domain mediates interaction with membrane lipids [ 1 ] . In vitro at high ionic strength , DNM2 is in monomer – tetramer equilibrium . At low ionic strength , DNM2 self - assembles into higher - order aggregates leading to a drastic increase in GTPase activity [ 17 , 18 ] . Microtubules or phospholipid vesicles , especially those containing PI4 , 5P2 , also induce self - assembly and increase DNM2 GTPase activity [ 5 , 17 , 19 ] . Purified from baculovirus , GTP - bound and GDP - bound monomer DNM2 has Kd values of 13 . 2 and 7 . 1 µM , respectively , with GTPase activity of 37 nmol / mg / min . When in an oligomeric state , the GTPase activity of DNM2 markedly increased and Kd values decreased [ 20 ] . When compared with small GTPases , DNM2 exhibits a relatively low affinity for GTP ( Km = 12 µM ) but high intrinsic rates of GTP hydrolysis . DNM2 activity is regulated by post - translational modifi - cations . DNM2 becomes phosphorylated on Tyr231 ( MD ) and Tyr597 ( PH domain ) through Src - mediated phosphoryla - tion , leading to albumin endocytosis [ 21 ] . In contrast , dopamine leads to the dephosphorylation of DNM2 by increasing protein phosphatase 2A activity , necessary for dopamine - induced Na + K + - ATPase endocytosis [ 22 ] . S - nitro - sylation of Cys86 ( GTPase domain ) and Cys607 ( PH domain ) by nitric oxide ( NO ) increases GTPase activity and endocytosis [ 23 ] . In a mouse model of kidney disease , cathepsin L induction leads to the cleavage of the cytoplas - mic DNM2 at positions 355 – 360 ( Fig . 1b ) [ 24 ] . Sever et al . identified a cathepsin L cleavage site at positions 355 – 360 in the middle domain ( Fig . 1b ) . Actin network is then reorganized in renal podocytes leading to filtration impair - ment and proteinuria [ 24 ] . It remains to be determined whether such proteolytic regulation occurs only in patholog - ical context and in other tissues . Finally , it was demonstrated that Ca 2 + inhibits DNM2 GTPase activity ( IC 50 = 150 µM ) and receptor - mediated endocytosis in Hela cells [ 25 ] . This may have physiological importance in excitable cells like neurons and muscle fibers . It is still largely unknown how DMN2 expression is regulated . In rat , DNM2 is up - regulated during normal pancreatic development after birth [ 26 ] but not in the liver [ 8 ] or the brain [ 27 ] . In mouse , treatment with opioid agonist results in increased DNM2 protein content in the spinal cord [ 28 ] whereas opioid antagonist decreases DNM2 abundance [ 29 ] . These changes in the level of DNM2 expression are inversely correlated with opioid receptor density at the plasma membrane , suggestive of feed - back regulation . DNM2 function Endocytosis DNM2 has been implicated in the formation of clathrin - coated pits ( Fig . 2 ) [ 17 ] . In the cytosol , DNM2 forms a complex with sorting nexin 9 ( SNX9 ) and fructose - 1 , 6 - bisphosphate aldolase [ 30 ] . Phosphorylation of SNX9 releases aldolase from the SNX9 – DNM2 complex which is now competent for membrane targeting [ 30 , 31 ] . DNM2 anchorage to the membrane occurs via interaction with PI4 , 5P2 membrane phosphoinositide [ 32 ] and BAR domain proteins , amphiphysin 1 , amphiphysin 2 , and SNX9 ( Table 1 ) in curved sites of the membranes . DNM2 forms an oligomer helical structure around the neck of the nascent vesicles [ 17 ] , and GTP hydrolysis is associated with the release of the vesicles . Interestingly , DNM2 co - localizes with clathrin before and during the internalization of the coated vesicle [ 6 ] suggesting that DNM2 plays also a role during the maturation of clathrin - coated pits [ 33 ] . DNM2 is also involved in clathrin - independent endocy - tosis by its participation in the formation of the phagosomes and caveolae [ 34 , 35 ] . Predescu et al . described a protein complex , including DNM2 , intersectin , and SNAP - 23 that was important for the internalization of caveolae [ 36 ] . In caveolae , DNM2 also interacts with endothelial nitric - oxide synthase ( eNOS ) in bovine aortic endothelial cells [ 37 ] where DNM2 may regulate eNOS activation and the NO signaling cascade [ 37 , 38 ] . DNM2 also participates in coat - independent endocytosis processes , i . e . , micropinocytosis and macropinocytosis , by which fluid droplets and specific membrane components are internalized [ 39 , 40 ] .

Anti - DNM2 antibody injection and over - expression of DNM2 mutants impair vesicle formation from the TGN [ 42 , 43 ] . Association of DNM2 with cortactin and syndapin 2 is required for trafficking of nascent vesicles from the TGN [ 44 , 45 ] . DNM2 is also found at the clathrin - coated buds of early endosomes [ 46 ] and in late endosomes in Hela cells , located to the tubulo - vesicular appendices [ 47 ] . In these two cases , interfering DNM2 mutant impairs the recycling of components from the endosomal system towards the plasma membrane or TGN [ 46 , 47 ] . These data highlight the role of DNM2 in the secretory pathway and in the sorting of cell components from the Golgi apparatus and endosomal compartment . Exocytosis DNM2 may participate in endocytosis – exocytosis coupling as suggested in mouse pancreatic β - cells [ 48 ] . However , a role for DNM2 in exocytosis alone has been reported . During cell - mediated killing by natural killer ( NK ) cells , DNM2 co - localizes with lytic granules after NK cell activation and is required for fusion of the granules with the plasma membrane [ 49 ] . Similarly in macrophages , focal exocytosis is blocked after anti - DNM2 antibody microinjec - tion [ 50 ] , and DNM2 GTPase activity regulates the fusion of secretory vesicles at the plasma membrane [ 51 ] . Further studies will be necessary to precisely identify the molecular role played by DNM2 in the exocytosis machinery . Actin network Actin - based dynamic processes are crucial for late - stage endocytosis and vesicle formation , and DNM2 interacts with the actin - binding proteins Abp1 ( actin - binding protein 1 ) [ 52 ] and cortactin [ 53 , 54 ] . Abp1 is an Src kinase which provides a physical bridge between the endocytosis machinery and the cortical actin network , and cortactin is a component of the clathrin - mediated Table 1 ( continued ) Name OMIM Site of interaction in DNM2 Function Reference γ - adaptin 603533 PRD [ 14 ] γ - tubulin 191135 MD Centrosome cohesion [ 65 ] ZO1 601009 nd Blood – testis barrier integrity [ 102 ] Abp1 actin - binding protein , CAP CBL - associated protein , CBL Cas – Br – M murine ecotropic retroviral transforming sequence homolog , CIP4 cdc42 interacting protein - 4 , eNOS endothelial nitric - oxide synthase , Ese1 EH domain and SH3 regulator of endocytosis 1 , FAK focal adhesion kinase , FBP17 formin - binding protein 17 , Grb2 growth factor receptor - bound protein 2 , IL - 5R α α subunit of the interleukin 5 receptor , Jak2 Janus kinase 2 , JAM - A junctional adhesion molecule A , KDR kinase insert domain receptor also known as : vascular endothelial growth factor receptor - 2 , MLK2 mixed - lineage kinase 2 , Nef accessory protein of the HIV - 1 , N - WASp Wiskott Aldrich syndrome protein , PDE γ inhibitory γ subunits of the retinal cGMP phosphodiesterase , PLC γ phospholipase C gamma 1 , PLD2 phospholipase D2 , SNX9 sorting nexin 9 , Tks5 / FISH tyrosine kinase substrate 5 / five SH3 domains , TULA Cbl - and ubiquitin - interacting protein T - cell ubiquitin ligand , Vav1 Rho family guanine nucleotide exchange factor Vav1 , ZO1 Zonula occludens 1 Fig . 2 DNM2 cellular functions .

However , interaction between DNM2 and the actin cytoskeleton may have another cytoskeletal role such as in the formation of membrane tubules and protrusions . Furthermore , a recent study showed the crucial function played by the DNM2 - cortactin complex in the global organization and remodel - ing of the actomyosin cytoskeleton [ 55 ] . In addition , DNM2 is present in cortical ruffles and lamellipodia , both important in cell migration [ 10 , 53 ] . The supramolecular complex including DNM2 , cortactin , and Arp2 / 3 mediates the reorganization of actin allowing lamellipodia formation at the leading edge of migrating cells [ 56 ] . Disruption of DNM2 functions by DNM2 - K44A mutant or small inter - fering RNA ( siRNA ) inhibits the formation of lamellipodia [ 57 ] . Similarly , under PDGF stimulation , DNM2 is con - centrated within the leading ruffles of migrating fibroblasts where it co - localizes with cortactin [ 53 ] . To allow cell migration , DNM2 participates in disassembly of focal adhesions , as well as β - integrin internalization at the rear of the cell [ 58 , 59 ] . Additionally , DNM2 is enriched in specialized membrane protrusions such as podosomes and invadipodia . Podosomes represent attachment sites between cells and substratum [ 60 ] , and invadipodia are focalized matrix degradation sites [ 61 ] . Inhibition of DNM2 dimin - ishes the amount of such structures [ 61 ] . It has also been shown that DNM2 regulates the formation of actin - stress fibers by interaction with the cell surface heparin sulfate proteoglycan syndecan - 4 [ 62 ] . Expression of DNM2 - mutant , truncated for the PRD domain mediating interac - tion with cortactin , increases the number of actin - stress fibers , which is associated with abnormal cell shape [ 53 ] . Microtubule network and MTOC DNM2 interacts with microtubules [ 17 , 63 ] , and the binding region was located to the PRD [ 5 , 64 ] . It was shown that down - regulation of DNM2 by siRNA increases the amount of acetylated tubulin , a more stable form of tubulin in microtubules and reduces their growing capacity [ 63 ] , suggesting that DNM2 may regulate the polymerization – depolymerization equilib - rium of microtubules . Through its interaction with micro - tubules , DNM2 appears involved in Golgi apparatus cohesion [ 63 ] . Moreover , DNM2 has been identified as a component of the centrosome , the main microtubule organizing center ( MTOC ) , where it binds to γ - tubulin [ 65 ] . The centrosome consists of a pair of centrioles embedded in a filamentous pericentriolar matrix , where γ - tubulin is essential for microtubule nucleation . The function played by DNM2 at the centrosome is still unknown , but DNM2 silencing by siRNA suggests a role in centrosome splitting [ 65 ] . Likewise , participation of DNM2 in all the phases of mitosis has also been reported . DNM2 is detected in the two MTOC during early prophase , along the mitotic spindle during metaphase and in the spindle midzone region during anaphase and early telophase [ 66 ] . Thereaf - ter , DNM2 is accumulated at the intracellular bridge where the final separation occurs . The time required for separation of the two daughter cells is longer in DNM2 knock - out cells [ 40 ] . Taken together , these data suggest that DNM2 may regulate microtubule - dependent processes by acting on microtubule dynamics and organization . Apoptosis In order to establish a stable Hela cell line over - expressing DNM2 isoform 2 , Fish et al . have reported a significant cell toxicity in dividing cells [ 67 ] . The cytotoxicity occurred via induction of apoptosis by a p53 - dependent mechanism . Similar results were gained in vascular smooth muscle cells [ 68 ] . The capacity to trigger apoptosis appears DNM2 - specific as DNM1 over - expression does not induce apoptosis [ 67 ] . The GTPase domain of DNM2 is crucial to induce apoptosis [ 69 ] . In addition , a point mutation ( p . I684K ) in the DNM2 GED enhances the apoptosis induction by the wild - type DNM2 suggesting that GED negatively regulates this DNM2 function [ 69 ] . Mitochondria are key players in apoptosis and , interestingly , DNM2 has been detected in isolated mitochondria from bovine lymphoblas - toid BL - 3 cells [ 70 ] . However , to our knowledge , such localization has not been reported in other cell lines or tissues . DNM2 also regulates the apoptosis - inducing Fas – Fas ligand pathway by facilitating the transport of Fas from the trans - Golgi network to the plasma membrane [ 71 ] . Specific functions of DNM2 isoforms In a cultured rat epithelial cell line ( clone 9 ) , both DNM2 isoforms 1 and 3 show punctuate labeling of clathrin heavy chain - positive or heavy chain - negative structures , but only isoform 1 , with the GEIL sequence in the MD , appears located to the Golgi apparatus [ 10 ] . These data suggest a role for the GEIL sequence in targeting to the Golgi apparatus . However , cell - type specificity probably exists , as isoforms without the GEIL sequence were also shown to be targeted to the Golgi apparatus in MDCK cells [ 43 ] , 3T3L1 adipocytes [ 72 ] , and fibroblastoid - like cells derived from mouse embryonic stem cells [ 40 ] . Nevertheless , this possible differential localiza - tion argues for distinct functions . Indeed , in clone 9 cells , the K44A mutants of isoforms 2 and 4 are able to inhibit fluid - phase endocytosis , whereas the mutant forms of isoforms 1 and 3 do not [ 39 ] and are also more potent inhibitors of clathrin - mediated endocytosis . Similarly , in a hepatocyte cell line , the K44A - isoform 1 inhibits caveolae - dependent internalization , but not the other K44A mutant isoforms [ 73 ] . In fibroblastoid - like cells derived from mouse embryonic stem cells , isoforms 2 and 4 are the most efficient at rescuing export from the Golgi in DNM2 knock - out cells [ 40 ] . Altogether , these data suggest a preferential involvement of isoforms 1 and 3 in clathrin - and caveolae - dependent endocytosis , whereas isoforms 2 344 J Mol Med ( 2010 ) 88 : 339 – 350 and 4 participate in uncoated endocytosis and trafficking from the Golgi apparatus . However , cell - type specificity also occurs as the four isoforms exhibit a similar subcellular distribution in 3T3L1 adipocytes , and dominant negative mutants of each isoform similarly affect basal and insulin - stimulated GLUT4 trafficking [ 72 ] . DNM2 and human diseases Mutations in the DNM2 gene cause rare forms of the Charcot – Marie - Tooth peripheral neuropathy ( CMT ) [ 2 , 74 – 77 ] and autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy ( CNM ) [ 3 , 11 , 78 – 80 ] . The 19 reported heterozygous mutations affect only the MD , the PH domain , and the GED ( Fig . 1b ) . DNM2 - related CNM is a slowly progres - sive congenital myopathy characterized by frequent cen - trally located nuclei in muscle fibers . The most common clinical features are delayed motor milestones , facial and generalized muscle weakness , ptosis , and ophthalmoplegia [ 81 ] . Nevertheless , the severity of DNM2 - CNM is variable , ranging from severe neonatal to mild late - onset forms . DNM2 - CMT is a peripheral neuropathy characterized by progressive muscle weakness and atrophy . DNM2 muta - tions can cause axonal CMT ( CMT2 ) and dominant intermediate CMT ( DI - CMT - B ) . In some CMT patients , neuropathy is associated with neutropenia [ 2 , 75 , 77 ] but this association has not been described in DNM2 - CNM patients . Clinical overlap could exist in some patients [ 81 ] , but the majority of patients are affected by a tissue - specific disorder . No clear genotype – phenotype relationship can be generated , except for the de novo mutations located in the C - terminal part of the PH domain , which are all associated with a severe neonatal CNM phenotype [ 98 ] . In these patients , the phenotype progressively improves , suggesting compensatory mechanisms . More recently , the DNM2 gene has been described as a susceptibility gene for late - onset Alzheimer disease [ 82 ] , and DNM2 expression was found to be decreased in the brains of these patients [ 83 ] . Cognitive impairments have been reported in some CNM patients harboring the p . E368Q [ 78 ] , p . R465W [ 84 ; Family 1 ] , and p . R369Q [ 84 ; Families 2 and 3 ] DNM2 mutations . Future studies will be necessary to determine the prevalence of central nervous system involvement in DNM2 - related diseases . Pathophysiological hypotheses The DNM2 mutations identified so far in CNM and CMT are heterozygous missense mutations or small deletions ( Fig . 1 ) . We have shown that DNM2 transcript , protein expression , and localization are normal in fibroblasts from CNM patients [ 3 , 11 ] . These data are in agreement with DNM2 mutants having a dominant negative effect , result - ing in a loss of function of DNM2 in endocytosis [ 11 ] or in microtubule - related functions [ 63 ] ( see below ) . Membrane trafficking and signaling pathway hypothesis In addition to the DNM2 mutations in autosomal dominant CNM , mutations in the BIN1 gene encoding amphiphysin 2 , a partner of DNM2 in the endocytic process , cause the autosomal recessive form of the disease [ 85 ] . This suggests that endocytic impairment is a potential pathomechanism of autosomal CNM . Indeed , impairment of clathrin - mediated endocytosis was reported in cultured cells expressing CNM - or CMT - DNM2 mutants [ 2 , 11 , 63 ] . Among these studies , one CMT - mutant was unable to block the uptake of transferrin , a marker of clathrin - mediated receptor endocyto - sis [ 63 ] . Nevertheless , the transferrin - containing compart - ment was not located to the perinuclear region after 30 min of incubation showing that its intracellular trafficking was impaired by the CMT - mutant . The crucial question which remains to be explored is how a defect in endocytosis can alter the cell function , especially in a tissue - specific manner . On one hand , inhibition of DNM2 - dependent trafficking may lead to a decrease in receptor stimulated signaling as shown for the MAPK ERK1 / 2 pathway [ 11 ] . On the other hand , DNM2 mutations may lead to a prolonged half - life of various proteins at the cell surface due to a defect in protein removal , as shown for the GLUT4 glucose transporter [ 72 ] . A deregulation of glucose transport in patients with DNM2 mutations could have a strong impact on muscle fibers given their high glucose consumption . To date , the impact of disease - associated DNM2 mutants on other DNM2 - dependent membrane trafficking processes , especially in endosomal and Golgi pathways , has not been studied . We cannot exclude a participation of these pathways in the pathomechanisms of DNM2 - related disorders . Cytoskeleton impairment and its putative role on nuclear positioning In DNM2 - CNM , the majority of patients harbor a mutation in the MD , which is essential for the centrosomal localization of DNM2 and for its interaction with γ - tubulin [ 65 ] . Previous results in skin fibroblasts indicate that transfected GFP - DNM2 - mutants fail to cor - rectly target to the centrosome , suggesting that DNM2 mutations might cause CNM by interfering with centroso - mal functions [ 3 ] . In addition , CMT - related DNM2 mutants can disorganize the microtubule cytoskeleton [ 2 ] , and one particular CMT - mutant was shown to impair microtubule - dependent membrane transport [ 63 ] . In addition to their roles in intracellular trafficking , the microtubule and actin networks regulate cellular architecture including nuclear positioning [ 86 , 87 ] . Thus , cytoskeletal impairment may J Mol Med ( 2010 ) 88 : 339 – 350 345 play a role in the abnormal central location of the nuclei in the muscle fibers in CNM . In CMT , DNM2 mutations could also induce a destabilization of the microtubule network leading to abnormal axonal transport and protein trafficking , a pathophysiological mechanism described previously in various forms of CMT [ 88 ] . T - tubule hypothesis in CNM The X - linked recessive form of CNM ( also called XLMTM for X - linked myotubular myop - athy ) is due to mutations in the MTM1 gene encoding the myotubularin , and the autosomal recessive and dominant CNMs result from mutations of amphiphysin 2 and DNM2 , respectively [ 89 ] . The muscle specific isoform of amphiphy - sin 2 is concentrated at T - tubules in mouse and drosophila and is involved in the organization of this plasma membrane invagination acting in excitation – contraction coupling [ 90 , 91 ] . Myotubularin is also located to the T - tubules in mouse [ 92 ] and zebrafish [ 93 ] , and knock - down of myotubularin in these species leads to disorganization of the T - tubule system , reduction in Ca 2 + release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum , and defect in excitation – contraction coupling [ 93 , 94 ] . In addition , abnormal localization of T - tubule markers was shown in muscle biopsies from BIN1 - CNM and MTM1 - CNM patients [ 85 , 93 ] , suggesting that an excitation – contraction coupling impairment due to T - tubule dysfunction could be a common pathomechanism leading to muscle weakness in CNMs . Future studies are necessary to explore this hypothesis in the DNM2 - CNM in which no morpholog - ical abnormalities of the T - tubule system have been reported to date . Concluding remarks and open questions Given the numerous distinct functions in which the ubiquitously expressed DNM2 is involved , the identifi - cation of pathophysiological mechanisms will be a challenge . The phenotypes encountered in CNM and CMT patients could be due to impairment of the various functions of the protein . To date , there is no explanation for the tissue - specific impact of the DNM2 - mutations in human diseases . DNM2 is engaged in numerous protein – protein interactions ( Table 1 ) , but these interactions in muscles and nerves are largely unexplored . Another unresolved question is whether each particular mutation can similarly affect the functions of the four DNM2 isoforms . Finally , whereas some data emerge on the impact of disease - related DNM2 mutations on the micro - tubule network , their impact on the actin cytoskeleton is totally unknown . Future developments of animal models will certainly be useful to better determine the main functions of DNM2 in vivo , especially in skeletal muscle and nerves where membrane trafficking displays unique cell length dependent characteristics .
