One such biophysical variation is the formation of a membrane or lipid raft , which plays important roles in many cellular processes . The lipid rafts on the cell membrane are mostly identified by specific dyes and heavy metal quantum dots , which have their own drawbacks , such as cytotoxicity , photostability , and incompatibility . To this end , we synthesized special , hydrophobic , fluorescent , photostable , and non - cytotoxic carbon dots ( CDs ) by solvent - free thermal treatment using non - cytotoxic materials and incorporated into the lipid bilayers of giant unilamellar vesicles ( GUVs ) made from 1 , 2 - dioleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phos - phocholine ( DOPC ) and dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine ( DPPC ) lipids . A 2 : 2 : 1 mixture of DOPC , DPPC , and cholesterol ( Chol ) develops lipid rafts on the membrane by phase separation . The photophysical properties of the CDs get modulated on incorporation into the lipid rafts that identifies the membrane heterogeneity . The main attempt in this work is to develop a new , simple , cost - effective , and bio - friendly lipid raft marker , which can be used in biological applications , alongside other conventional raft markers , with more advantages . Keywords Carbon dots · Fluorescence · Hydrophobic · Biocompatible · Lipid bilayer · Lipid raft markers Introduction Cellular membranes are found to be laterally heterogeneous , consisting of submicrometer domains [ 1 – 3 ] . These assorted membranes or lipid rafts hold plenty of roles in biological events including apoptosis , cell adhesion , numerous signal transduction pathways , synaptic transmission , organization of the cytoskeleton , and protein sorting [ 4 – 6 ] . In addition , the lipid rafts may change the conformation of resident proteins , which , in turn , affects their activity [ 7 ] . These are also useful for receptor activation , spatially organizing the plasma membrane , intracellular trafficking , and control - ling the cellular entry of many viruses , bacteria , and toxins [ 8 – 12 ] . Specific lipids , such as cholesterol ( Chol ) , interact with the relatively ordered regions in the membrane plane that invite other lipids and proteins [ 13 ] . It is proved that preferential interactions of certain lipids collectively gener - ate lateral domains due to liquid – liquid phase separation [ 14 ] . The Chol and sphingolipid - enriched , 10 – 200 nm het - erogeneous and dynamic lipid rafts reside in both the inner and the outer leaflets of an asymmetric cell membrane [ 15 , 16 ] . The dynamism of these transient and relatively ordered membrane domains makes it very difficult to study the lipid rafts directly by microscopy , and hence , alternatively , model membranes are used [ 7 ] . A mixture of high - melting relatively saturated lipids and low - melting unsaturated phospholipids can separate the membranes into two distinct liquid phases involving Chol , namely liquid - ordered ( L o ) and liquid - disordered * Sukhendu Nandi sukhendu @ iitism . ac . in * Pradipta Purkayastha ppurkayastha @ iiserkol . ac . in 1 Department of Chemical Sciences , and Center for Advanced Functional Materials , Indian Institute of Science Education and Research ( IISER ) Kolkata , Mohanpur 741246 , WB , India 2 Department of Biological Sciences , Indian Institute of Science Education and Research ( IISER ) Kolkata , Mohanpur 741246 , WB , India 3 Department of Chemistry , Indian Institute of Technology ( Indian School of Mines ) Dhanbad , Dhanbad 826004 , India 4 Present Address : Department of Chemistry , College of Engineering and Technology , SRM Institute of Science and Technology , SRM Nagar , Tamil Nadu , Kattankulathur 603203 , India Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry ( 2022 ) 414 : 6055 – 6067 / Published online : 14 June 2022 Chatterjee A . et al . 1 3 ( L d ) phases [ 17 – 19 ] . The relatively packed L o phase is enriched in saturated lipids and Chol [ 18 ] , whereas the L d phase mainly contains the unsaturated lipids and is more fluidic [ 19 ] . The lipid rafts are constituted by the L o phases in the membrane . Molecular details of such phase separation are elucidated by incorporating fluoro - phores in the lipid bilayers and monolayers [ 20 , 21 ] and giant unilamellar vesicles ( GUVs ) [ 22 ] . Lipid rafts are commonly augmented in sphingolipids and Chol [ 4 , 13 , 23 , 24 ] . Chol finds tight intercalation with lipids having long and saturated acyl chains to give rise to the L o phase unlike the loosely packed liquid crystalline L d phase cre - ated by the unsaturated phospholipids [ 25 , 26 ] . Hence , most raft proteins dissociate on removing Chol from the membrane rafts and become non - functional . Chol controls the membrane fluidity , association , membrane density , and other physicochemical parameters . Visualization of het - erogeneous lipid domains in model bilayer membranes is a palpable proof for the coexistence of L o and L d phases [ 7 , 27 – 36 ] . The size of the L o domains in anionic lipid monolayer and heterogeneous bilayer depends drastically on the charge density of the lipid monolayer [ 28 ] . Although sphingomyelin often mixes with Chol to form lipid rafts , such domains can also develop without sphingomyelin [ 18 , 32 , 33 ] . Lipid - spe - cific fluorescent dyes are mostly used as markers to observe the dynamics of the lipid rafts [ 27 , 35 – 37 ] . Such probes , however , suffer limitations due to inefficient bilayer inser - tion , commotion of the bilayer organization , reduced optical brightness , and rapid photobleaching . As an alternative , peo - ple have used heavy metal – containing fluorescent quantum dots ( QDs ) to track the lipid rafts [ 38 – 40 ] . In the hunt to overcome the biocompatibility problem , Nandi et al . used ultrasmall fluorescent carbon dots ( CDs ) to visualize and image the lipid membrane and live cells [ 39 , 40 ] . CDs are fluorescent carbonaceous species containing several func - tional groups like amine , hydroxyl , carbonyl , etc . depend - ing upon their precursor and also the carbonization condi - tions . These functional groups impart characteristic surface properties which help them to interact with the functional groups present in the molecules involved in molecular self - assemblies , such as liposomes or niosomes . These interac - tions take place through H - bond formation or by electro - static interaction [ 39 , 40 ] . CDs may possess hydrophobic functional groups on the surface that directs them for hydro - phobic interaction with the suitable environment [ 41 ] . While Nandi et al . did not use the CDs to identify the lipid rafts , recently , De et al . reported a distinct emission behavior of hydrophobic CDs on embedding them into the L o and L d phases of the lipid membrane without developing rafts [ 41 ] . Moreover , they synthesized the CDs from melamine and dithiosalicylic acid in acetic acid medium [ 42 ] . Melamine is injurious to health as it may induce reproductive damage and the formation of bladder or kidney stones , and lead to bladder cancer [ 43 , 44 ] . Considering the drawbacks of using membrane dyes and the heavy metal – containing QDs in a biological environ - ment , in the present work , we have reported that hydropho - bic CDs , prepared from non - toxic materials , can be effec - tively used to identify the lipid rafts in model membranes . On the basis of the hydrophobic interaction between the alkyl chains present on the CD surface , we extended it to interact with the lipid bilayers , which are either homogene - ous or heterogeneous on the formation of lipid rafts . The photophysical changes of the CDs are efficiently utilized to mark the lipid rafts herein , and characterized by confocal laser scanning microscopy ( CLSM ) and fluorescence life - time imaging microscopy ( FLIM ) providing all the photo - physical details to specifically identify the lipid raft domains . We have previously shown that FLIM is a very informative technique to study the transportation dynamics in lipid vesi - cles [ 45 ] . Penetration of dopamine was meticulously studied using excited - state energy transfer dynamics with negatively charged fluorophore - labeled lipid vesicles at various tem - peratures . Hence , this technique has been explored here , as well , to label the lipid rafts . The non - cytotoxicity of the CDs was proved by cell viability assay with two different cell lines [ 46 ] . Materials and methods Materials and reagents All the chemicals and reagents used in the experiment were of high purity ( > 98 % ) . Sucrose , dodecylamine , cholesterol , tris base , sodium hydroxide pellets , potassium chloride , and concentrated hydrochloric acid were procured from Sigma - Aldrich , USA . 1 , 2 - Dioleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine ( DOPC ) and dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine ( DPPC ) were bought from Avanti polar lipids and used without further purification . Chloroform and methanol were obtained from Sigma - Aldrich in pure form and used as received . Highly pure water ( > 99 % ) was used to prepare the tris buffer solu - tion . All the experiments were done at 25 °C and pH 7 . 4 . The microscope cover glasses and glass slides were obtained from Blue Star , India , and thoroughly cleaned before use . Synthesis of the hydrophobic CDs The luminescent , hydrophobic CDs were synthesized by a one - step thermal treatment of the precursors following Guo et al . and Chatterjee et al . [ 47 , 48 ] . Briefly , 10 mg ( 0 . 03 mmol ) sucrose and 11 . 1 mg ( 0 . 06 mmol ) dodecylamine were taken in a glass vial and heated at 210 °C for 10 min . After the thermal treatment of the precursors , the resultant 6056 Biocompatible and optically stable hydrophobic fluorescent carbon dots for isolation and… 1 3 mixture was allowed to cool down to room temperature , yielding a brown suspension implying formation of the CDs . The brown suspension was re - dispersed in 5 mL of ethanol through vortexing and centrifuged at 14 , 000 rpm for 30 min to remove the heavy precipitate and agglomerated particles . Ethanol was gently evaporated under reduced pressure to obtain a brown solid . The same procedure was repeated once more using ethanol and then twice with acetone , to remove unreacted sucrose followed by solvent removal under reduced pressure to eliminate any oxidation product of dodecylamine . Finally , the brown solid was re - dispersed in chloroform for further experiments . The w / w yield of the synthesized CDs is 65 % . The fluo - rescence quantum yield of the prepared CDs is around 0 . 65 % in water ( with 1 % dioxane as a co - solvent ) and 7 . 5 % in chloroform , as measured using quinine sulfate ( QY 0 . 54 ) in 0 . 1 M H 2 SO 4 as an external standard . Incidentally , the QY of the CDs got enhanced up to 24 % and 30 % upon encapsula - tion in DOPC and DPPC lipid bilayers , respectively . The for - mation and surface passivation of the CDs were confirmed by a control experiment using only dodecylamine . Thermal treatment of pure dodecylamine did not form CDs in analo - gous condition . Hence , it can be stated that the one - step ther - mal treatment of the mixture of sucrose and dodecylamine resulted into the production of luminescent graphitic CDs where sucrose acts as the source of carbon , followed by in situ surface passivation by dodecylamine to make them hydrophobic in nature . In the CDs , sucrose makes the gra - phitic core after carbonization at an elevated temperature [ 49 ] while conjugation of the carbonyl groups in sucrose and the amine part of dodecylamine make the surface passivated sates with amide linkages along with the hydrophobic alkyl chains . The CDs did not get photobleached on exposure to 365 nm radiation for 2500 s ( Fig . S1 ) . Cell viability assay of the CDs Cytotoxicity of the hydrophobic CDs ( HCDs ) was deter - mined against HEK 293 T and Hela cell lines using MTT assay . The HEK 293 T and HeLa cell lines were obtained from the National Centre for Cell Science ( NCCS ) , Pune , India . In brief , cells were seeded in a 96 - well plate at a cell density of 6 × 10 4 cells per well in Dulbecco’s modi - fied Eagle’s medium ( DMEM ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) ( 200 μL per well ) , antibiotics ( 100 units mL −1 penicillin and 100 μg mL −1 streptomycin ) incubated at 37 °C and maintained in a 5 % CO 2 environ - ment . After 24 h of growth , the media was removed and replaced with fresh DMEM media containing the HCD at the desired concentration . The compounds were dissolved in ethanol ( molecular biology grade ) and then diluted with growth media before adding to the cell . The concentration of ethanol was maintained within 0 . 4 % in all the wells . After 48 h of incubation , the drug - containing media was removed and the wells were replenished with fresh media ( 200 μL ) containing 1 mg / mL MTT . After 3 h of incubation , the media was removed and the resulting formazan crystals were dissolved in DMSO . The inhibition of cell growth induced by the HCDs was detected by measuring the absorbance of each well at 590 nm using a BIOTEK epoch microplate reader . Synthesis of the CD – encapsulated GUVs The GUVs were prepared by slightly modifying the rapid evaporation technique reported earlier by Moscho et al . [ 50 ] . To prepare the CD – encapsulated GUVs of various compo - sitions , a pre - adjusted amount of the stock solution of the CDs was mixed with a fixed amount of the respective lipid stock solutions ( and Chol stock solution , whenever required ) in chloroform . The mixture was then transferred to a 250 - mL round - bottom flask , and the aqueous solution of the raw materials ( 2 . 5 mL of 0 . 1 M sucrose , 0 . 1 mM KCl , 50 mM tris solution , pH 7 . 4 ) was carefully added with a pipette along the wall of the flask and gently stirred for 5 min . The organic solvent was removed at room temperature in a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure ( final pressure 20 mbar ) . After evaporation for ∼ 4 – 5 min , an opalescent fluid was obtained with a volume of ∼ 2 . 5 mL , which indi - cated the formation of the GUVs . The total lipid concentra - tion was adjusted as 1 mM ( with respect to the buffer ) for each composition . In brief , GUVs containing only DOPC and DPPC had 1 mM total lipid concentration , while DOPC / DPPC ( 1 : 1 ) GUVs contained 0 . 5 mM of both the lipids and the DOPC / DPPC / cholesterol ( 2 : 2 : 1 ) GUVs had a ratio of 0 . 4 mM : 0 . 4 mM : 0 . 2 mM ( 20 mol % Chol ) , respectively . The chemical structures of the lipids as well as the schematic of the synthesis is given in Fig . S1 . Experimental methods The characterization and analysis of the samples were done following the procedure described previously [ 48 ] . Below are the details of the processes . A JEM - 2100F , JEOL field emission gun ( FEG ) electron microscope was used for taking the transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) images using a 200 - kV electron source . An ethanol solution of the CDs was prepared and drop - casted on a carbon - coated copper grid and dried before imaging . The size distribution of the particles was calculated from 50 randomly chosen samples from the high - resolution TEM ( HRTEM ) image . The GUVs were imaged after drop - casting and air - drying on a carbon - coated copper grid . A QM 40 spectrofluorimeter from PTI , Inc . was used to collect all the steady - state fluorescent spectra . The UV – Vis absorption spectrum of the CDs was collected on a 6057 Chatterjee A . et al . 1 3 U - 2900 UV − visible double - beam spectrophotometer from Hitachi . The time - resolved fluorescence decay studies were done applying the time - correlated single photon counting ( TCSPC ) method using a picosecond spectrofluorimeter from Horiba Jobin Yvon IBH equipped with a FluoroHub single photon counting controller . The samples were excited by a 340 - nm diode laser ( temporal resolution < 1 ns ) . The raw data were fitted using a non - linear least - square iteration procedure using IBH DAS6 ( version 2 . 2 ) software . The aver - age fluorescence lifetime values , ⟨ τ ⟩ , were calculated using the following equation : where τ i is the excited - state lifetime component of the decay curve and A i is the corresponding amplitude of that compo - nent . The time - resolved rotational anisotropy , r ( t ) , data were collected via the same TCSPC setup using excitation and emission polarizers and was calculated using the following equation : where G is the correction factor for the detector , which is sensitive to the polarization direction of the emission , and I ∥ ( t ) and I ⊥ ( t ) are the fluorescence intensity decays polarized parallel and perpendicular to the excitation light , respec - tively . The rotational correlation time ( τ rot ) was extracted by fitting the time - resolved anisotropy decay using a suitable equation . To obtain the FT - IR spectrum of the prepared CDs , the chloroform solution of the sample was drop - casted on the scanner and the IR spectra were acquired using Bruker ( Alpha ) in ATR mode ( Pt ATR ) at room temperature aver - aging 256 scans with a resolution of 4 cm −1 . The background signals were subtracted from each of the experimental spectra . The confocal images were captured on a Leica SP8 con - focal setup using a 63 × oil immersion objective . The sam - ples were excited by a 405 - nm laser , and the emission was collected between 425 and 475 nm . Confocal scanning was performed with a step size of 400 nm ; the three - dimensional projection of GUVs was reconstructed from confocal slices with the LASX ( Leica ) software . The FLIM images were obtained by a confocal laser scan - ning microscope ( Axio Observer A1 ) from Zeiss coupled with a DCS - 120 system from Becker & Hickl ( BH ) GmbH for fluorescence lifetime imaging and a picosecond diode laser ( BDL - 488 - SMC , BH ) with λ ex = 488 nm . The scan - ning was controlled by a BH GVD - 120 scan controller . The BH HPM - 100 – 40 hybrid detector module in the DCS - 120 system was controlled by DCC - 100 software . A long - pass ( 1 ) ⟨ 𝜏 ⟩ = � i A i 𝜏 i 2 ∕ � i A i 𝜏 i ( 2 ) r ( t ) = I ∥ ( t ) − GI ⟂ ( t ) I ∥ ( t ) + 2 GI ⟂ ( t ) filter ( HQ495LP ) was placed to block the excitation light , and a narrow band - pass filter of 525 − 550 nm ( HQ525 / 50 ) was used to monitor the emission . The TCSPC FLIM sys - tem is controlled by the “SPCM” TCSPC operating software and the DCC - 100 detector controller software . The emitted light from a selected point of the sample was collected by the microscope lens , scanned by the galvanometer mirrors , separated from the excitation beam , split into two channels of different wavelengths , and focused into pinholes in a plane conjugate with the focal plane in the sample . The out - of - focus light was thus suppressed . The FLIM images were analyzed by the SPC - Image software used for decay meas - urements at a particular point of the sample . For both the FLIM and CLSM studies , the microscope cover glasses and slides were cleaned thoroughly by sequential washing in an ultrasonic bath with water , alcohol , acid , and alkali and dried properly . Then 20 μL of freshly prepared CD encapsulated GUV solutions of different compositions was drop - casted on a glass slide and was enclosed with a cover glass . The XPS experiments were performed on an X - ray photo - electron spectrometer ( PHI 5000 versa probe III ) working at ultrahigh vacuum ( 1 × 10 −9 bar ) and equipped with an AlK α X - ray source and a monochromator . The X - ray beam size was 100 μm . The survey spectra were recorded with pass energy ( PE ) 280 eV , and the high - energy resolution spectra were recorded with pass energy ( PE ) 55 eV . An ethanol solu - tion of CDs was drop - casted on a silicon wafer , dried , and subjected to XPS analysis . Quantum yield of the as - synthesized CDs in a particular solvent was determined by comparing the integrated fluo - rescence intensity ( in the measured range between 400 and 650 nm ) upon excitation at 340 nm and the absorbance of the CDs at that wavelength . The respective values were recorded for the reference or standard quinine sulfate in 0 . 1 M H 2 SO 4 ( refractive index ( η ) = 1 . 33 ) , and the calculations were done according to the following equation : where ∅ = quantum yield , I = integrated fluorescence inten - sity , A = absorbance , and η = refractive index . The subscript R indicates the reference . Results and discussion Synthesis and characterization of the hydrophobic and biocompatible fluorescent CDs Depending on the precursors , CDs are mostly biocompat - ible and have inherent conductance and photoluminescence ( PL ) properties [ 51 , 52 ] . These are frequently used to study ∅ = ∅ R I ( 1 − 10 − A R ) 𝜂 2 I R ( 1 − 10 − A ) 𝜂 2 R 6058 Biocompatible and optically stable hydrophobic fluorescent carbon dots for isolation and… 1 3 intersystem energy transfer [ 52 , 53 ] , photo - induced elec - tron transfer ( PET ) [ 54 – 57 ] , biosensing [ 58 ] , catalysis [ 59 , 60 ] , etc . These are chemically stable with a broad excita - tion / emission spectral range and minimal photobleaching , which make them promising candidates for bioimaging [ 61 , 62 ] . In this work , we have used a novel solvent - free thermal technique to synthesize the hydrophobic CDs from a homo - geneous mixture of sucrose and dodecylamine as described in the previous section [ 63 ] . The induced hydrophobicity of the CDs was aimed to incorporate them readily into the hydrophobic lipid membrane . Figure 1A presents the synthetic flowchart of the CDs used in the present study . HRTEM provided the size distri - bution ( 3 – 9 nm ) , averaging at 5 . 6 ± 1 . 2 nm , and crystallinity of the as - synthesized CDs ( Fig . 1B , C ) . The inter - planar distance of the crystal planes is 0 . 21 nm corresponding to the ( 100 ) lattice plane of graphene [ 64 ] . The absorption peak at 260 nm corresponds to the π – π * transition of the graphitic core of the CDs , and the shoulder between 300 and 400 nm is due to the n – π * transitions between the surface functional groups containing non - bonding electrons ( Fig . 1D ) . The PL of the CDs is excitation wavelength - dependent in chloro - form medium , which is consistent with the previous findings [ 64 ] . The emission intensity maximizes on exciting them at 375 nm ( Fig . 1D , E ) . FT - IR spectroscopy confirmed that the carbonyl groups on the surface of the CDs reacted with dodecylamine through amide bond formation ( Fig . 1F ) . The 3340 cm −1 signal corresponds to the N – H stretch of second - ary amide , and those at 1710 cm −1 and 1650 cm −1 depict the amide C = O stretch and N – H bend , respectively . The signal at 2900 cm −1 corresponds to the sp 3 C – H stretching . Troughs at 1470 cm −1 and 1370 cm −1 mark the > CH 2 and – CH 3 bends , respectively . The signal at 1075 cm −1 signifies the C – N stretch , and those below 800 cm −1 correspond to the long aliphatic chain . XPS analysis ( Fig . 1G – J ) clearly reveals the presence of various oxygen - containing functional groups on the surface of the CDs . Especially , the deconvo - luted C 1 s spectrum ( Fig . 1H ) of the CDs shows peaks with binding energies at 284 . 7 eV and 288 . 6 eV , which attribute to the C – N and C = O bonds of amide , respectively . The signal at 399 eV corresponds to the amino nitrogen ( – NH 2 ) , while the signal at 399 . 2 eV signifies the presence of the pyrollic nitrogen ( > NH ) , respectively , in the deconvoluted N1s spectrum ( Fig . 1I ) . In the O1s spectrum ( Fig . 1J ) , we get a signal at 531 . 6 eV , corresponding to the C = O functional moiety in the CD surface . The synthesized CDs acquire excellent photostability on incorporating into the hydrophobic lipid bilayer of the GUVs Fig . 1 Synthesis and characterization of the CDs : A the synthetic scheme , B TEM image of CDs with a histogram for size distribu - tion ( scale bar = 20 nm ) , C HRTEM image of a single CD ( scale bar = 5 nm ) showing the crystal planes , D absorption spectrum , E excitation wavelength - dependent luminescence , F FT - IR spectrum , G XPS full - scan spectrum and high - resolution H C 1 s , I N 1 s , and J O 1 s peaks in the XPS spectra . The characterization was carried out at 25 °C in chloroform 6059 Chatterjee A . et al . 1 3 ( Fig . S2 ) . We used DOPC and DPPC to construct the unilamel - lar and mixed GUVs applying a slightly modified rapid evapo - ration technique [ 50 ] . HEK 293 T and HeLa cell lines were adopted to study the cytotoxicity of the synthesized CDs using MTT assay . The derived IC 50 value provides an estimation of the cytotoxicity scale of the substance . The IC 50 values of 56 and 14 μg mL −1 , obtained by application of the CDs on HEK 293 T and HeLa cell lines , confirmed their non - cytotoxicity ( Fig . S3 ) . Such a claim of relative non - cytotoxicity on the CDs used herein can be justified by comparing the experimentally obtained IC 50 values with some reported ones . Determination of the IC 50 value provides an idea on the concentration of the substance required to inhibit a biological function to 50 % . According to some previous reports , compounds having the IC50 values of < 5 µg / mL are always considered to be highly cytotoxic and those having IC50 values > 50 µg / mL are con - sidered to be non - toxic [ 65 , 66 ] . The IC 50 values of various lipid - capped PbS QDs were reported to be around 2 µg / mL in HeLa and HEK293T cell lines [ 67 , 68 ] . That of CuO QDs was obtained to be around 7 . 4 µg / mL in C2C12 cells [ 69 ] . Pegylated phospholipid encapsulated CdSe / CdS / ZnS QDs and InP / ZnS QDs showed the IC 50 values to be around 2 µg / mL for BGC - 823 and SH - SY5Y cell lines [ 70 ] . Free doxorubicin ( Dox ) , a chemotherapeutic drug , shows the IC 50 values to be around 8 . 14 µg / mL for MCF - 7 and 1 . 3 and 0 . 5 µg / mL , respec - tively , for HeLa and HEK293T cells [ 71 ] , while that for the Dox - decorated graphene quantum dots , it is between 2 . 85 and 3 . 9 µg / mL [ 72 ] . For several biological cells , the IC 50 value of Rh123 is reported to be < 1 µg / mL [ 73 , 74 ] . Photophysics of the incorporated CDs in the L o and L d phases of the GUV membrane DPPC and DOPC lipids produce vesicles with the L o and the L d phases , respectively , due to their structural peculiarity [ 64 , 75 , 76 ] . It is reported that the binary mixture of unsatu - rated and saturated lipids at a 1 : 1 molar ratio does produce domain - like patterns , where the more ordered DPPC lipid remains in the L o or gel phase and the less ordered DOPC remains in the L d or fluid phase [ 77 , 78 ] . This shows that the binary mixture of DOPC / DPPC ( 1 : 1 ) produces vesicles where the L o and L d phases coexist with each other . How - ever , the domain pattern in the DOPC / DPPC ( 1 : 1 ) vesicles is different than that in the DOPC / DPPC / Chol ( 2 : 2 : 1 ) vesi - cles . In the former case , the L o phase formed island - like regions on the surface of the GUVs , where the CDs have slightly larger fluorescence intensity due to the preferential binding environment . Whereas , with 20 % Chol , the domain pattern changes drastically and becomes circular with more uniformity and lesser area fraction of the L o phase [ 78 ] . It is important to note that the molecular packing of the mem - brane at high Chol concentration is affected by the unsatu - ration of the acyl chain . Xu et al . found that packing of the DOPC / Chol lipid bilayer is comparatively loose than that of the DPPC / Chol at the same Chol concentration [ 79 ] . Thus , the structural differences of the lipids largely control the water permeability into the lipid bilayer of vesicles [ 64 ] . Saito et al . calculated that the water permeability is lower in the L o phase compared to that in the L d phase [ 75 ] . A study with mixed solvents ( water - dioxane ) shows that the electronic energy states of the synthesized hydrophobic CDs are practically insensitive to the microenvironment polarity ( Fig . S4 and Table S1 ) . However , the PL intensity increases on reducing the water content in the solvent mix - ture . Emission from the hydrophobic CDs correlated well with the mixed - solvent study . CDs inside the DOPC bilayer ( L d phase ) fluoresce with less intensity compared to those inside the DPPC bilayer ( L o phase ) due to the difference in the water content ( Fig . 2A ) , which is consistent with the cal - culations of Saito et al . [ 75 ] . The intersystem crossing in the tightly packed CDs inside the DPPC membrane reduces and hence decreases the singlet loss , which , in turn , enhances the PL intensity compared to that in the DOPC membrane . The quantum yield of the CDs got enhanced up to 24 % and 30 % upon encapsulation in DOPC and DPPC lipid bilay - ers , respectively . Moreover , a distinct spectral shift of the CDs was observed in these two particular cases . CDs in the DOPC and the DPPC bilayers emit with the maxima at 439 and 450 nm , respectively ( Fig . 2B ) . This bathochromic shift can be attributed to the rotational restrictions imposed by the lipid environment on the CDs , remembering their insensitivity to the environment polarity . The first singlet excited energy states of the CDs are derived from the emis - sion maxima under various circumstances ( Fig . 2C ) . The L d phase of the DOPC GUVs , supposedly , is much loose to provide greater rotational freedom to the entrapped CDs compared to the L o phase of the DPPC GUVs . A mixture of DOPC and DPPC ( 1 : 1 ) shows phase sepa - ration due to the immiscible liquid phases and exists as fluid - gel [ 80 ] . The saturated DPPC lipids colonize into the L o phase , and the DOPC lipids group into the L d phase . The hydrophobic CDs find their ways into the two phases , which in turn , can be readily identified from the photo - physical changes . The trapped CDs into the bilayer of the DOPC - DPPC GUVs emit with a PL maximum at 451 nm , which is very similar to that in the bilayer of the DPPC GUVs due to energetic similarity ( Fig . 2B , C ) . The inten - sity of emission from the CDs in the mixed lipid phase is greater than that in the homogeneous L d phase of the DOPC GUVs ( Fig . 2A ) . Chol intercalates tightly prefer - ably within the long and saturated acyl chains of lipids to produce the L o phase [ 30 – 32 ] . This creates pronounced rafts in the lipid membrane that alter the photophysics of the trapped CDs ( Fig . 2B , C ) [ 18 , 32 , 33 ] . The time - resolved fluorescence decay data corrobo - rate well with the findings from the steady - state emission 6060 Biocompatible and optically stable hydrophobic fluorescent carbon dots for isolation and… 1 3 experiments . PL from CDs mainly originates from the sur - face states within the graphitic carbon core without quan - tum confinement effect [ 81 , 82 ] . These are formed because of the transition due to the termination of the surface of a solid material that changes the electronic band structure and hence the emission parameters [ 83 ] . The time - resolved emission decay can , thus , be fitted with multi - component exponential routine . The average lifetime ( τ av ) of the excited species is informative in the case of the CDs . We noticed an increase in the τ av from that in the bulk solvent while the CDs are trapped inside the homogeneous L d and the L o phases of the DOPC and the DPPC GUVs , respectively ( Table 1 ) . The τ av is noticeably higher in the DPPC bilayer ( 6 . 23 ns ) than in the DOPC bilayer ( 5 . 25 ns ) with an inter - mediate value ( 6 . 12 ns ) in the DOPC – DPPC mixed GUVs because of the lateral heterogeneity [ 1 – 3 ] . The well - defined lipid rafts , formed due to the intercalation of Chol into the lipid domains in DOPC – DPPC – Chol ( 2 : 2 : 1 ) GUVs , increase the τ av for the CDs to 6 . 45 ns . A more careful investiga - tion of the time - resolved fluorescence data signifies that the higher lifetime component , which is supposedly due to the lipid bilayer – encapsulated CDs , is showing a gradual enhancement upon change in the lipid bilayer composi - tion . The longest lifetime component is highest in the DOPC – DPPC – CHO mixture ( 7 . 43 ns ) , while it was lower in the other compositions . These findings get good support Fig . 2 Photophysical modifications of the hydrophobic CDs under various conditions : A steady - state emission , B normalized emission spectra , C spectroscopically derived ground ( S 0 ) and excited sin - glet ( S 1 ) energy states of the CDs ( not to scale ) , and D and E time - resolved emission and anisotropy decays of the CDs under various conditions at 25 °C and pH 7 . 4 ( λ ex = 340 nm , λ em = 450 nm ) Table 1 Time - resolved emission decay data for the hydrophobic CDs in bulk aqueous phase and entrapped in the lipid bilayer of the GUVs with and without Chol .

The rotational times ( τ rot ) strictly followed the trend of the τ av values , the highest being for the CDs inside the DOPC – DPPC – Chol GUVs ( Table 2 ) . The rotational anisotropy values here could be due to the local restrictions on the rotation of the CDs upon incorpora - tion in the lipid rafts . Confocal imaging of the CDs in the L o and L d phases in the GUV membrane Different lipophilic fluorescent dyes were previously used to identify the lipid rafts [ 29 , 84 – 86 ] . We showed that the syn - thesized hydrophobic CDs are capable of labeling the lipid membranes with greater advantages . Along with the TEM micrographs ( Fig . 3A – C ) , a series of confocal images of the various GUVs ( Fig . 3D – F ) constructed either by a single type or mixture of lipids are presented , which demonstrate the organization of lipids and exhibit the domain morphol - ogy on the addition of Chol . Figure 3A – C shows that the GUVs are unilamellar [ 50 ] . Pure DOPC and DPPC construct homogeneous GUVs ( Fig . 3D , E ) . Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) showed that the DOPC GUVs are in fluid phase at room temperature since the bleached fluorescence recovered within 5 s . However , FRAP did not occur even in 10 min in the GUVs prepared from pure DPPC because of the homogeneous gel phase of the membrane ( inset of Fig . 3E and Fig . S5 ) . Kahya et al . found uniform fluorescence in bilayers formed from DOPC / sphingomy - elin ( SM ) GUVs [ 29 ] . However , we found that the GUVs from DOPC and DPPC , mixed in a 1 : 1 molar ratio , exist as fluid – gel ( Fig . 3F ) . Similar behavior was also observed before by Veatch et al . [ 18 ] . Formation of the lipid rafts was pronounced on mixing 20 % Chol to the DOPC - DPPC mixed GUVs ( Fig . 3G ) . The phase - separated GUVs in Fig . 3F and G show differences in the CD emission intensity due to het - erogeneity . Remembering that these hydrophobic CDs fluo - resce stronger in the L o phase compared to the L d phase , we could identify the separated phases easily on exciting the CDs in the GUVs .

The studies were done at 25 °C 6062 Biocompatible and optically stable hydrophobic fluorescent carbon dots for isolation and… 1 3 FLIM of the CDs in the L o and L d phases of the GUV membrane The lateral membrane heterogeneity of lipid vesicles due to the L o and L d phases was monitored using various tech - niques applying FLIM . As reported before , the environment - sensitive and dual - emissive fluorescent dyes could identify the segregated phases [ 87 ] . A combination of FLIM - FRET using fluorescent dyes was also used in determining the vari - ous advents of lipid rafts on the cell membrane in different biological processes [ 88 , 89 ] . However , there is a lack of reports on the use of CDs FLIM . Thus , it is important to find out the photophysical modulations of the CDs using FLIM . The hydrophobic fluorescent CDs in the present report pro - vided useful information on the lipid rafts due to their pho - tophysical modulations . Figure 4 depicts the FLIM images of the CD – incorporated GUVs prepared from DOPC , DPPC , DOPC – DPPC ( 1 : 1 molar ratio ) , and DOPC – DPPC – Chol ( 2 : 2 : 1 molar ratio ) . While the pure GUVs from DOPC and DPPC showed single mode lifetime distribution , phase sepa - rations of the lipids in the latter two cases show bimodal spread indicating the lipid segregation ( Fig . 4 ) . The marked regions in DOPC and DPPC GUVs show similar values for the CD emission decay . However , the life - times of the CDs at these regions of the DOPC – DPPC and DOPC – DPPC – Chol GUVs are noticeably different ( Table 3 ) . The difference is more pronounced for DOPC – DPPC – Chol GUVs due to prominent raft formation . The lifetime distribu - tion plots , given in Fig . S6 , support our findings . We could not collect the slowest lifetime component ( ca . the TCSPC data ) because of the limitation of the FLIM set - up . The data obtained from FLIM correlated very well with the TCSPC data . We found that the τ av values for the phase - separated DOPC – DPPC GUVs and CDs in the DOPC and DPPC regions could be identified . The most stabilized CDs in the DPPC – Chol raft composition decayed the slowest of all . Fig . 4 FLIM images of CD – incorporated membrane bilayer of the GUVs from A DOPC , B DPPC , C DOPC – DPPC ( 1 : 1 ) , and D DOPC – DPPC – Chol ( 2 : 2 : 1 ) . The excited states’ lifetimes at the marked zones ( I and II ) were noted in each case . The color codes for the lifetime distributions are given below each image . The samples were excited by a pulsed 488 - nm laser at 25 °C 6063 Chatterjee A . et al . 1 3 Establishing CDs as new probes for lipid rafts There are numerous fluorescent probes ( majority of them are fluorescent dyes ) which were successfully used to selectively detect the lipid rafts or the lipid domains in the model membranes using FLIM , fluorescence correla - tion spectroscopy ( FCS ) , confocal fluorescence scanning microscopy ( CFLSM ) , etc . The fluorescent dyes that were majorly used were 25 - NBD - Chol , BODIPY - Chol , C6 - NBD - PC , Rhodamine - DOPE , diI - C18 ( 1 , 1 ′ - dioctadecyl - 3 , 3 , 3 ′ , 3 ′ - tetramethylindocarbocyanine ) , etc . [ 35 , 90 ] . Out of these , in one case , dil - C18 was used successfully for detec - tion of lipid domains in a model membrane made up of DOPC : DPPC : Chol at 2 : 2 : 1 ratio [ 77 ] . Similar to the hydro - phobic CDs used herein , the dil - C18 probe also showed some preferential binding with the ordered phase showing differently colored domains in the GUVs upon addition of 20 % Chol . In another experiment , the sterol analog 25 - NBD - Chol was used to study its localization in the model mem - brane using binary mixtures of phospatidylcholine / Chol in bilayer of the GUVs [ 91 ] . It was found that unlike dil - C18 or Chol , the 25 - NBD - Chol analog preferentially localizes itself to the more disordered regions inside the lipid bilayer [ 35 , 90 – 93 ] . Hence , to establish the suitability of our CDs , we performed a positive control experiment using 25 - NBD - Chol to distinguish the lipid domains in the GUVs compris - ing of DOPC : DPPC : Chol in 2 : 2 : 1 ratio , using FLIM as the determining tool ( Fig . 5 ) . It is important to note that the probe localizes itself in the disordered , Chol - poor regions of the lipid bilayer of the GUVs , which are unsaturated lipid rich . Some portions of the imaged GUVs are dark due to lack of the probe identifying the lipid rafts . This experi - ment clearly stands out as a positive control of our overall findings . Conclusions We have demonstrated that small , non - cytotoxic , biocompat - ible , fluorescent , and hydrophobic CDs can be synthesized using a novel solvent - free thermal treatment . These CDs are very stable and non - photobleaching in non - polar solvents and GUV membranes of various compositions . The hydro - phobic nature ensures their existence inside the membrane Table 3 The determined lifetimes of the CDs at the two specified regions in each of the FLIM images of the GUVs in Fig . 3 Medium Marked regions τ 1 ( ps ) τ 2 ( ps ) τ av ( ps ) DOPC GUVs I 359 ± 8 ( 67 ) 1694 ± 34 ( 33 ) 799 ± 16 II 344 ± 7 ( 69 ) 1775 ± 35 ( 31 ) 794 ± 16 DPPC GUVs I 799 ± 16 ( 81 ) 2068 ± 41 ( 19 ) 1036 ± 21 II 774 ± 15 ( 82 ) 2307 ± 46 ( 18 ) 1045 ± 21 DOPC – DPPC GUVs I 509 ± 10 ( 74 ) 2102 ± 42 ( 26 ) 929 ± 16 II 475 ± 9 ( 76 ) 1922 ± 38 ( 24 ) 815 ± 16 DOPC – DPPC – Chol GUVs I 822 ± 16 ( 85 ) 2335 ± 47 ( 15 ) 1048 ± 21 II 412 ± 8 ( 77 ) 2018 ± 40 ( 23 ) 803 ± 16 Fig . 5 FLIM images of A DOPC : DPPC : Chol ( 2 : 2 : 1 ) and B DOPC GUVs containing 25 - NBD - Chol as the fluorescent probe 6064 Biocompatible and optically stable hydrophobic fluorescent carbon dots for isolation and… 1 3 bilayer of the GUVs . These hydrophobic CDs could effi - ciently overcome the drawbacks of using small molecule fluorophores or heavy metal – infested QDs in lipid raft iden - tification in a very cost - effective and simple way . The photo - physical changes of the CDs in different environments due to motional restriction make them extremely useful .
