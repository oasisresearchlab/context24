Peckys 1 criticized our paper on live - cell imaging 2 as unrealistic , even though the visualization of Escherichia coli was accomplished in a liquid cell using low - dose scanning transmission electron microscopy . Their criticism hinged on two claims : ﬁ rst , that the minimum electron dose to obtain contrast for scanning transmission electron microscopic ( STEM ) visualization was “ many orders of magnitude above the lethal dose ” ; and second , that our interpretation of the viability assay was faulty . In this rebuttal , we argue , to the contrary , that it is entirely realistic to visualize E . coli within the unforgiving range of parameters tested so far . Our argument has ﬁ ve salient aspects . First , de Jonge and Peckys ’ argument regarding the minimum electron dose stemmed from a ﬂ awed premise , originating with Reimer and Kohl . 3 Although their reference was not speci ﬁ c , we assume that de Jonge and Peckys were referring to the discussion of Table 11 . 4 in the book by Reimer and Kohl where it was remarked that reproductive death of E . coli was supposed to occur near q = 8 × 10 − 8 C / cm 2 , associated with a dose of a 0 . 005 e − / nm 2 at 100 kV . ( Likewise , in the citation attributed to Isaacson , 4 Table 1 . 7 referred to radiation damage measured by the colony - forming properties of E . coli at a dose of 6 . 2 × 10 − 4 e − / nm 2 . ) Reimer and Kohl went on to estimate the minimum dose required for a high - resolution ( d = 5 nm ) image of a biological specimen to be about q min = ek 2 / fd 2 C 2 ∼ 3 × 10 − 4 C / cm 2 = 37 e − / nm 2 , where κ = 1 ( κ = 5 is the Rose criterion ) denotes the signal - to - noise ratio , C = 0 . 01 represents the contrast , and f = 1 is the fraction of electronics contributing to the image background , which seems to be orders of magnitude above the estimated lethal dose . The premise of de Jonge and Peckys ’ letter was essentially ﬂ awed because the values o ﬀ ered by Reimer and Kohl ( and Isaacson ) were scaled ; they were interpretations of results , not measurements , obtained from a linear conversion of absorption measurements in water ( generally ) taken under very di ﬀ erent circumstances ( e . g . , with 70 kV X - rays or 1 to 50 MeV electron beams ) 5 from the imaging accomplished in our work . The rationale used for this interpretation relied on a translation of “ Rads ” or Grays associated with absorption to an imaging dose , but it ignored the di ﬀ erences between absorption and imaging . Unlike absorption , only a small fraction of the beam energy is actually transferred to the thin specimen during imaging . This caveat was stipulated explicitly by Isaacson and others . 4 , 6 Thus , the interpretation o ﬀ ered in Reimer and Kohl cannot be compared directly to the doses used in our work . However , there have been measurements 7 , 8 using TEM to image E . coli in a liquid cell at 200 kV that report a lower bound on the lethal dose , indicating only that E . coli remained viable for doses > 5 × 10 − 6 e − / nm 2 at 200 kV , according to a LIVE / DEAD Baclight viability assay . Second , de Jonge and Peckys mistakenly represent that the prokaryotic cells ( bacteria ) in our study cannot be viable after electron - beam exposure because the “ . . . minimum dose used was 0 . 2 e − / Å 2 ( 20 e − / nm 2 ) . ” Contrary to their representation , the ﬁ rst micrograph presented in the paper was acquired using 4 e − / nm 2 ( Figure 1d in the original article ) . Furthermore , Figure 1f in the original paper conveys a monotonically decreasing viability from 1 e − / nm 2 with increasing dose , which is 20 - fold below the minimum electron dose they attribute to our work in their letter . Parenthetically , the images shown in Figure 3a − d in the original article were all acquired at doses less than or comparable to 20 e − / nm 2 . Third , their argument about viability after electron irradiation is immaterial as it proceeds from a misleading comparison between the data we acquired exclusively from strains of E . coli , a prokaryote and one of the most widely used bacterium in genetic engineering and biotechnology , and their results from yeast , the simplest of eukaryotic cells . Among the myriad of di ﬀ erences between yeast and E . coli , what is especially relevant is that the cell wall in yeast , which encapsulates a volume of about 50 μ m 3 including the nucleus , cytoskeleton , and subcellular organelles , consists of a micro ﬁ brillar array of glucan chains with a laminated proteoglycan layer that is estimated to be about 105 − 115 nm thick , depending on how it is measured . 9 , 10 Unlike yeast , E . coli have no nucleus and are characterized by a cell envelope encapsulating about 1 μ m 3 that consists of an inner cytoplasmic ( CM ) and outer ( OM ) cell membrane with a thin peptidoglycan sacculus , which is essentially one giant macromolecule , within an aqueous compartment ( the periplasm ) sandwiched in between . 11 , 12 As evident from Figure 2b in the original article , 2 the OM and CM were estimated to be about 8 − 18 nm thick , separated by about 34 nm . Parenthetically , the elasticity of the cell envelope ( attributed mainly to the sacculus ) is supposed to be 2 . 5 MPa , 13 Received : September 30 , 2016 Published : January 24 , 2017 L e tt e r t o t h e E d i t o r www . acsnano . org © 2017 American Chemical Society 3 DOI : 10 . 1021 / acsnano . 6b06616 ACS Nano 2017 , 11 , 3 − 7 about 4 - fold sti ﬀ er than yeast . 14 Taken together , the cell volume , which a ﬀ ects absorption , and the di ﬀ erences between membrane thickness , architecture , composition , and sti ﬀ ness confound a direct comparison between yeast and E . coli . Fourth , de Jonge and Peckys discounted our estimate of the lethal dose su ﬃ cient to kill 50 % of the population , LD 50 , because it relied on a LIVE / DEAD Baclight assay for measuring ( bacterial ) viability . Our reliance on the LIVE / DEAD assay Figure 1 . E . coli viability measured by gene expression after electron irradiation .

Inset : Time dependence of the cumulative ﬂ uorescence per cell , illustrating that the ﬂ uorescence after IPTG induction increases at about the same rate with ( red , 20 e − / nm 2 ) and without ( blue ) electron - beam irradiation , although the gene expression diminishes after irradiation . ACS Nano Letter to the Editor DOI : 10 . 1021 / acsnano . 6b06616 ACS Nano 2017 , 11 , 3 − 7 4 followed a plethora of other work using the same test , 7 , 8 , 15 and it was based on the observation that with necrosis and / or apoptosis , the cell ’ s metabolism shuts down ; it loses membrane integrity ; and it lyses . Thus , membrane integrity is routinely used as a measure of viability . Brie ﬂ y , the assay uses a membrane - permeant SYTO 9 label to report live bacteria with green ﬂ uorescence , and membrane - impermeant propidium iodide ( PI ) to identify membrane - compromised bacteria with red ﬂ uorescence . SYTO 9 penetrates the bacterial cell membrane and binds to nucleic acids in both live and dead cells , whereas PI penetrates and intercalates into nucleic acids only if the membrane is compromised ( i . e . , when a cell dies ) . When SYTO 9 and PI are mixed and applied to a dead cell , PI preferentially binds to nucleic acids , such that SYTO 9 ( green ) ﬂ uorescence weakens and PI ( red ) ﬂ uorescence predominates . Although several factors have to be taken into account , such as di ﬀ erent binding a ﬃ nities to live and dead cells and bleaching of SYTO 9 , 16 the interpretation of the data was unambiguous so long as both the red , green , and background ﬂ uorescence channels were accurately recorded . 2 The results of a LIVE / DEAD assay , performed as a function of electron - beam dose at 300 kV , revealed that LD 50 = 29 . 4 e − / nm 2 , which coincidently was in - line with other work showing a loss of membrane integrity there ( Figure 1f in the original article ) . 17 Importantly , Figure 1f conveyed a monotonically decreasing viability with increasing dose delivered to the cell , starting near 80 % viability at 1 e − / nm 2 and decreasing below 10 % at 80 e − / nm 2 . Since , according to de Jonge and Peckys , all these cells should be dead regardless as the dose was “ many orders of magnitude above the lethal dose ” , the membrane integrity should have been compromised , too , which was clearly not the case , refuting the premise of their letter . Instead , the data support the conclusion that the cells were alive but increasingly compromised by doses above 29 e − / nm 2 . In agreement with this assessment , but in an apparent contradiction to their letter , de Jonge and Peckys indicated in a recent publication that a “ snapshot ” acquired with liquid STEM using a dose of 40 e − / nm 2 informed on the ultrastructure of a live cell as assessed by ﬂ uorescence microscopy , and that subsequent images in other areas contained information about the live cell ( although damage may have occurred ) . 18 Admittedly , the LIVE / DEAD assay was an imperfect measure of E . coli viability . Even if the membrane remained intact , radiation damage was inescapable because secondary e ﬀ ects such as the production of small di ﬀ usible radicals like OH − in a hydrated specimen were likely to occur , 19 a ﬀ ecting life processes . However , the observations of binary ﬁ ssion , the low - frequency tumbling of E . coli under the beam , and the infection of E . coli by P1 bacteriophage , also reported in the original article , lent further support to the idea that the cells were still alive . For example , motile ( tumbling ) bacteria were reportedly observed at low electron doses ( see video V1 in the original article , Supporting Information ) , but the motion stopped within seconds for > 10 e − / nm 2 · frame electron doses , indicating the adverse e ﬀ ect of a high dose . Another example illustrating the dynamics of a life process was the infection of E . coli by P1 , which was the main focus of our paper . The infection process was supposed to involve , ﬁ rst , absorption of the phage to receptors , the terminal glucose residue in the core of the lipopolysaccharide molecules present on the outer surface of the OM of the host cell , and then ( contraction of the tail and ) injection of the viral DNA , which was actually visualized in Figure 3d of the original article , although only a fraction ( typically < 10 % ) of the membrane area was actually exposed to the beam . 2 In this context , P1 binding and infection of the host depends on Ca 2 + and other speci ﬁ c host factors . 20 The speci ﬁ cs of the infection process , in particular , have been embroiled in controversy because the physical mechanism for genome injection has yet to be elucidated ( for P1 ) . It has been speculated that the duration of the process might di ﬀ erentiate between the various schemes pro ﬀ ered to explain injection , such as pressurized DNA in the capsid versus transport assisted by speci ﬁ c proteins . 21 In our work , the time required for DNA injection was measured to be so fast ( < 10 s ∼ 93 kbp / 10 kb / s ) that it likely precluded transport by speci ﬁ c proteins , implicating either a pressure and / or osmotic pressure mechanism instead . 21 Finally , since the viability of bacteria irradiated at the dose required for imaging was the crux of the issue , another assay was performed , which was accomplished following a protocol similar to that described originally , 2 except that now the test of viability after electron - beam irradiation was conducted on a genetically engineering version of E . coli ( DH5 α ) transformed with plasmid pFNK - 113 ( Figure 1a ) . 22 The E . coli harboring this 113 plasmid had an inducible LuxI - LVA gene that was coexpressed with a ﬂ uorescent reporter , a degradable version of the green ﬂ uorescent protein ( GFP - LVA ) . When induced with isopropyl β - D - 1 - thiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG ) , the expression of LuxI - LVA in the 113 E . coli , which facilitated transiently the synthesis of a quorum sensing signal  3OC 6 − HSL  by leveraging the cell ’ s metabolism , was signaled by the green ﬂ uorescence . 22 Thus , the observation of green ﬂ uorescence , induced by IPTG , informed on gene expression . To assess the e ﬀ ect on cell viability , these 113 E . coli were attached to the top membrane of a 5 μ m thick liquid cell , irradiated with an electron beam , and then induced to express ( LuxI - LVA and ) GFP - LVA . Subsequently , the ﬂ uorescence was tracked up to 24 h after induction . Initially , the 113 E . coli were dark  no ﬂ uorescence was observed prior to induction , as usual ( Figure 1b ) . 22 However , after induction , the ﬂ uorescence increased with time ( Figures 1c , d ) at a rate ( Figure 1e , inset ) consistent with the kinetic rate constants ( k 1g = 2 × 10 − 3 s − 1 , k g = 0 . 5 × 10 − 5 s − 1 , and λ g = 2 . 7 × 10 − 4 s − 1 ; see Methods ) used to describe transcription , translation , oxidation , and degradation of GFP - LVA in other work accomplished without electron - beam irradiation . 22 Even though the ﬂ uorescence improved with time , the average ﬂ uorescence per cell associated with irradiated 113 E . coli was diminished relative to the zero - dose control , signaling a decline in gene expression with electron - beam irradiation . On average , 93 % of the cell population ﬂ uoresced green without electron - beam irradiation . On the other hand , when irradiated with doses ranging from 0 to 30 e − / nm 2 · frame , only a fraction of the cell population ﬂ uoresced , depending system - atically on the dose ( Figure 1e ) . The cumulative green ﬂ uorescence observed 120 min after irradiation with electron doses q < 30 e − / nm 2 ( Figure 1e ; solid circles ) indicated that 113 E . coli can express protein even after an exposure “ many orders of magnitude above ” , although LD 50 ∼ 10 e − / nm 2 estimated this way was less than that inferred from a LIVE / DEAD assay ( LD 50 ∼ 21 e − / nm 2 ) used to interrogate the same strain after similar exposures ( Figure 1e ; open circles ) in separate experiments . ( The original work used the LIVE / DEAD assay on a di ﬀ erent strain of E . coli , AW405 , to show LD 50 = 29 . 4 e − / nm 2 . ) It is likely that the discrepancy between these two estimates for LD 50 , derived from gene expression and ACS Nano Letter to the Editor DOI : 10 . 1021 / acsnano . 6b06616 ACS Nano 2017 , 11 , 3 − 7 5 LIVE / DEAD assays , measured di ﬀ erent aspects of life . Nevertheless , these data demonstrate indisputably that tran - scription , translation , oxidation , and proteolytic digestion can occur in 113s , despite exposure to doses > 10 e − / nm 2 , which invalidates the argument by de Jonge and Peckys . In conclusion , we discovered a process window for visualizing live E . coli bacteria with low - dose STEM that is small and unforgiving  it demands a dose < 29 e − / nm 2 · frame , uranyl acetate < 0 . 1 % v / v for positive staining ; medium that is nearly phosphate - free , and bacteria localized near the top thin window in a 2 μ m thick liquid cell , but it is not impossible according to LIVE / DEAD viability assay that measured membrane integrity . What was new in this response to de Jonge and Peckys ’ letter was a viability assay that measured gene expression in E . coli in a liquid cell after electron - beam irradiation . This assay indicated that transcription , translation , oxidation , and proteolytic digestion can occur in E . coli irradiated with an electron dose consistent with high - resolution imaging . We gratefully acknowledge the illuminating criticisms of our work like those o ﬀ ered by de Jonge and Peckys and the reviewers of our manuscripts . We have bene ﬁ ted from exchanges with them and the editor . METHODS The viability assay was accomplished using a protocol similar to that described in the original article , 2 except that tests were conducted on a genetically engineering version of E . coli ( DH5 α ) , transformed with plasmid ( pFNK - 113 ) . 22 The 113 E . coli harboring this plasmid had an isopropyl β - D - 1 - thiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG ) - inducible LuxI - LVA gene , which is a degradable form of LuxI derived from a “ quorum sensing ” gene found in Vibrio ﬁ scheri that was coexpressed with a degradable version of green ﬂ uorescent protein ( GFP - LVA ) . The ﬂ uorescent reporter , GFP - LVA , was degraded by proteolytic digestion as indicated in the control experiments . 22 Thus , gene expression , re ﬂ ected by a ﬂ uorescent transient reporter ( GFP - LVA ) functionally linked to a quorum sensing gene ( LuxI ) in the 113s , was sensitive to the IPTG inducer . Brie ﬂ y , to test viability following electron - beam irradiation , the top E - chip comprising the liquid cell was coated with a thin layer of 0 . 1 % v / v poly - L - lysine ( PLL , Sigma ) ( 50 kDa MW ) to make the windows hydrophilic and promote cell attachment . The 113s in minimal medium ( M9 ) was incubated with it for 1 h and then washed ﬁ ve times to remove unattached bacteria . To load the sample , O - rings were ﬁ rst added to ensure a hermetic seal in the chamber . A 5 μ m thick spacer was then placed in the slot of the holder with its silicon nitride surface facing up , and a thin ( < 1 μ L ) ﬁ lm of minimal ( M9 ) medium was pipetted onto its top side . After the liquid volume was reduced by evaporation , the “ top ” E - chip , coated with adhering bacteria , was placed face - down on the spacer chip , forming the liquid cell . In this way , the silicon nitride surfaces of both chips were kept in M9 medium continuously . The liquid cell was closed with the coverlid , and excess solution was carefully removed from its exterior edges using ﬁ lter paper . The holder was then tested for leaks , and the exterior was exposed to an oxygen plasma for 3 min . Samples were collected and exposed to electron doses ranging from 0 to 30 e − / nm 2 · frame . To control the electron dose during image acquisition , the pixel dwell time ( i . e . , increasing the STEM scanning speed ) was reduced . STEM images were recorded with 512 × 512 pixel resolution at room temperature using TIA software ( Philips / FEI , Delft ) with a pixel dwell time that ranged from 4 to 20 μ s and a pixel size ranging from 0 . 42 nm magni ﬁ cation ( 115000 × ) to 26 . 65 nm ( magni ﬁ cation 5000 × ) . As a control , only a portion of each window was irradiated so that cells exposed to the electron beam could be evaluated alongside cells that su ﬀ er little or no exposure . Following exposure to the beam , gene expression was induced with 700 μ M of IPTG injected into the liquid cell , and then confocal ﬂ uorescence microscopy was used to track gene expression and score cell viability . The viability was scored by counting the bacteria expressing ﬂ uorescent GFP - LVA in the exposed area relative to the unexposed area ( 0 e − / nm 2 · frame ) in the same liquid cell . The ﬂ uorescence data were collected using a Leica TCS SP5 II ( Leica Microsystems ) confocal microscope with enhanced , hybrid GaAsP detectors for improved sensitivity to ﬂ uorescence . All confocal images were acquired using a Fluotar 10 × 0 . 3 NA ( Leica ) objective , a 70 μ m pinhole with a 488 nm argon excitation laser at a power of < 100 nW . The time dependence of the ﬂ uorescence was found to be consistent with a deterministic model that captured the dynamics of gene expression : 22 λ = − M t k O M d [ ] d [ ] [ ] g 0g L m g λ = − − G t k M k G G d [ ] d [ ] [ ] [ ] L 1g g g L m L λ ′ = − ′ G t k G G d [ ] d [ ] [ ] L g L g L in which the parameters O L , M g , G L , and G L ′ denote the concentration of the LuxI / GFP - LVA operator , the LuxI / GFP - LVA mRNA , and the GFP - LVA ( unoxidized and oxidized ) , respectively . The parameters k 0g and λ m describe , respectively , the transcription and degradation of M g , whereas k 1g , k g , and λ g account for the translation , oxidation , and degradation of GFP - LVA .
