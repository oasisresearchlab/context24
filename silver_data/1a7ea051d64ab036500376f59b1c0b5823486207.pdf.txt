We recently showed that angiotensin II ( Ang II ) acutely increases albumin ﬁ ltration in the healthy kidney . Here , we used intravital microscopy to assess the effects of Ang II on podocyte function in rats . Acute infusion of 30 , 60 , or 80 ng / kg per minute Ang II enhanced the endocytosis of albumin by activation of the type 1 Ang II receptor and resulted in an average ( 6 SEM ) of 3 . 7 6 2 . 2 , 72 . 3 6 18 . 6 ( P , 0 . 001 ) , and 239 . 4 6 34 . 6 m m 3 ( P , 0 . 001 ) albumin - containing vesicles per glomer - ulus , respectively , compared with none at baseline or 10 ng / kg per minute Ang II . Immunostaining of Ang II – infused kidneys con ﬁ rmed the presence of albumin - containing vesicles , which colocalized with megalin , in podocin - positive cells . Furthermore , podocyte endocytosis of albumin was markedly reduced in the presence of gentamicin , a competitive inhibitor of megalin - dependent endocytosis . Ang II infusion in - creased the concentration of albumin in the subpodocyte space , a potential source for endocytic protein uptake , and gentamicin further increased this concentration . Some endocytic vesicles were acidi ﬁ ed and colocalized with LysoTracker . Most vesicles migrated from the capillary to the apical aspect of the podo - cyte and were eventually released into the urinary space . This transcytosis accounted for approximately 10 % of total albumin ﬁ ltration . In summary , the transcellular transport of proteins across the podocyte constitutes a new pathway of glomerular protein ﬁ ltration . Ang II enhances the endocytosis and trans - cytosis of plasma albumin by podocytes , which may eventually impair podocyte function .

Albumin - uria is a symptom of glomerular disease but also , a cause ; thus , it is involved in the development of renal interstitial ﬁ brosisandeventually , adeclineinkidney function . 1 The glomerular ﬁ ltration barrier consists of the fenestrated endothelium , the basement mem - brane , and the podocytes . Lesions of the podocytes , such as podocyte effacement , detachment , or micro - villus transformation , inevitably lead to the develop - ment of albuminuria . 2 Patients with albuminuria , in most cases , bene ﬁ t from a blockade of the renin angiotensin system ( RAS ) , and RAS inhibition has antiproteinuric effects , even in individuals without hypertension . 3 In a recent study , angiotensin II ( Ang II ) increased the glomerular ﬁ ltration of an FITC - labeled Ficoll with a molecular mass between 70 and 400 kD . 4 In a more direct study , using intravital microscopy , these data were largely con ﬁ rmed for the plasma protein albumin . 5 Thus , the sieving coef ﬁ cient of albumin increased markedly after infusion of Ang II in healthy nonhypertensive rats , and this effect was mediated by the angiotensin II type 1 ( AT1 ) Received November 24 , 2014 .

In line with our hypothesis , cultured immortalized human podo - cytes were shown to perform caveolae - dependent endocyto - sis of albumin , 7 and albumin - containing vesicles could be observed by electron microscopy in mouse , rat , and human tissue . 8 Using intravital multiphoton micros - copy ( MPM ) and electron microscopy , we found that Ang II infusion promotes the endocytosis of albumin by podocytes . The podocyte albumin endocytosis during Ang II infusion was mediated by the AT1 re - ceptor , megalin dependent , and facilitated byan increaseinthealbuminconcentration of the SP . Moreover , the podocytes released albumin - containing vesicles into the uri - nary space . Furthermore , analysis of the urine showed the excretion of albumin - containing vesicles of podocyte origin . Our data suggest a novel mechanism of trans - cellular plasma protein transport across the ﬁ ltration barrier and emphasize the crucial role of this pathway during proteinuria . RESULTS Ang II Induces the Endocytosis of Plasma Albumin by Podocytes We recently used MPM to show that acute Ang II infusion increases the sieving coef ﬁ - cient for albumin in the normal glomerulus . To assess the consequences of the increased ﬂ ow of albumin across the ﬁ ltration barrier for podocyte function , we infused increasing concentrationsofAngIIinrats . Meanarterial pressure ( MAP ) was 98 . 9 6 5 mmHg at base - line and rose to 102 . 4 6 4 , 109 . 8 6 4 , 120 . 1 6 5 , and 132 . 7 6 3 mmHg for 10 , 30 , 60 , and 80 ng / kg per minute Ang II , respectively ( n = 7 each ) . The Ang II – mediated increase in MAP was accompanied by a slight de - crease in glomerular capillary ﬂ ow , which declined from 10 . 3 6 1 . 6 nl / min at baseline to 8 . 1 6 1 . 4 , 8 . 0 6 1 . 2 , 7 . 9 6 1 . 1 , and 7 . 0 6 1 . 2 nl / min during infusion of 10 , 30 , 60 , and 80 ng / kg per minute Ang II , respectively ( n = 29 each ; P = 0 . 002 , P = 0 . 02 , P = 0 . 02 , and P , 0 . 001 , respectively , versus baseline ) . Plasma Ang II concentrations increased from 92 6 22 pg / ml at baseline to 582 6 108 pg / ml during the infusion of 80 ng / kg per minute Ang II ( n = 4 ) . During baseline conditions , there was no visible albumin endocytosis by podocytes . By contrast , Ang II infusions of 10 , 30 , 60 , and 80 ng / kg per minute increased the total volume of three – dimensional reconstructed albumin – containing vesicles to 0 , 3 . 7 6 2 . 2 , 72 . 3 6 18 . 6 ( P , 0 . 001 ) , and 239 . 4 6 34 . 6 m m 3 ( P , 0 . 001 ) , respectively ( n = 40 for each concentration ) ( Figure 1C ) . Podocyte endocytosis of albumin was abolished when the animals were injected with the AT1 receptor antagonist losartan ( 9 . 9 m g / kg ; n = 25 ) before starting the infusion of Ang II ( Figure Figure 1 . Ang II – induced albumin endocytosis by podocytes is mediated by the AT1 receptor . ( A ) MPM image of a rat glomerulus during baseline conditions .

In some experiments , podocytes were visualized using MPM by negative imaging during constant infusion of Lucifer Yellow ( LY ) ( Figure 1A ) . 9 Images obtained during these experi - ments revealed a colocalization of LYand Alexa BSA in the Ang II – induced endocytic vesicles , suggesting that podocytes per - form ﬂ uid - phase uptake . The formationofthe endocyticvesicles was restricted to the capillary aspect ofthe podocytes ( Figure 1B ) and absent during control experiments , when 0 . 9 % saline was infused into the animals ( Figure 1C ) ( n = 15 ) . Immunohisto - chemistry of kidney sections of Ang II – infused rats showed that the albumin - containing vesicles are found in podocin - positive cells in the glomerulus ( Figure 2C ) . Electron micros - copy images of kidney sections of the Ang II – infused animals further con ﬁ rmed that the endocytic vesicles contained albu - min . As shown in Figure 3 , immunogold staining of albumin was localized in vesicular structures within the podocytes as well as in the proximal tubule . Podocyte Albumin Endocytosis Is Megalin Dependent Albumin endocytosis bycultured human podocytes is caveolae dependent . 7 Our immunostainings con ﬁ rmed the expression of caveolin - 1 in the podocytes ( Figure 4A ) of the Munich Wistar Froemter ( MWF ) rat and revealed that glomerular al - bumin colocalized with caveolin - 1 ( Figure 4B ) . Because meg - alin colocalizes with caveolae in various cell types 10 and because the proximal tubular uptake of ﬁ ltered albumin is mediated by the megalin / cubilin complex , 11 – 13 we hypothe - sized that megalin may be involved in the uptake of albumin by podocytes . We used immunohistochemistry to assess the ex - pression of megalin in podocytes of the MWF rat . As can be seen in Figure 4C , megalin was expressed in rat podocytes and colocalized with the slit – membrane protein podocin . Similar results were obtained with human kidney tissue ( Figure 4D ) . To assess the function of megalin in the podocytes , we used gentamicin as a competitive inhibitor of megalin – dependent albumin endocytosis . 14 When rats were pretreated with gen - tamicin ( 100 mg / kg body wt intraperitoneally daily ) for 5 days , the dose – dependent albumin endocytosis induced by Ang II infusion was markedly reduced compared with vehicle - pretreated animals . The total volume of endocytic vesi - cles after infusion of 60 and 80 ng / kg per minute Ang II averaged 1 . 5 6 1 . 5 and 22 . 5 6 6 . 3 m m 3 ( n = 27 each ) for the gentamicin groups and 72 . 3 6 18 . 6 and 239 . 4 6 34 . 6 m m 3 for the vehicle - pretreated groups , respectively ( P = 0 . 003 and P , 0 . 001 , respectively ) ( Figure 5 ) . Considering possible unspeci ﬁ c toxic effects of the chronic gentamicin treatment , we used a second approach and acutely infused gentamicin at a rate of 33 mg / kg per hour . The gentamicin infusion was started 1 hour before the infusion of Ang II and maintained throughout the experiment . Again , podocyte albumin uptake was attenuated by gentamicin treatment . In response to acute gentamicin infusion , the endocytotic volumes during infusion of 60 and 80 ng / kg per minute Ang II were reduced to 14 . 7 6 6 . 3 ( P = 0 . 24 ) and 51 . 10 6 15 . 0 m m 3 ( P , 0 . 01 ) , respectively , compared with 72 . 3 6 18 . 6 and 239 . 4 6 34 . 6 m m 3 , respectively , for the vehicle - pretreated groups ( Supplemental Figure 1 ) . Finally , immunohistochemistryon renal sections of Ang II – infused rats revealed the colocalization of glomerular albumin Figure 2 . Endocytic vesicles in podocytes contain plasma albumin .

These data suggest that the Ang II – induced albumin endocytosis by podocytes is largely if not completely megalin dependent . Ang II Increases the Albumin Concentration in the SP Because the formation of endocytic vesicles in response to Ang II apparently occurred at the capillary aspect of the podocytes , we next determined if Ang II leads to changes in the albumin concentration in the SP , which is considered a compartment of the ﬁ ltration barrier with restricted ﬂ uid movement ( Figure 6A ) . 9 , 15 The ﬂ uorescence intensity in the SP relative to that in the blood plasma did not change during infusion of 0 . 9 % saline ( NS ; n = 7 ) ( Figure 7B ) . By contrast , the albumin concen - tration in the SP increased by 19 . 4 % after infusion of 80 ng / kg per minute Ang II compared with base - line ( P = 0 . 002 ; n = 20 ) ( Figure 6B ) . When the rats were pretreated with gentamicin , the albumin concentration in the SP in - creased even further during Ang II infusion compared with Ang II – infused and vehicle - pretreated rats ( + 34 . 8 6 7 % ; P = 0 . 02 ; n = 10 ) ( Figure 6B ) . These data suggest that Ang II causes an accumulation of albumin below the podocyte cell body and that the endo - cytic activity of the podocyte may contrib - ute to the clearance of the ﬁ lter . 16 – 18 Endocytosed Albumin Is Partly Located in Acidi ﬁ ed Vesicles The albumin - containing vesicles had two fates . One subset was acidi ﬁ ed over time as judged by the reduction of red channel ﬂ uorescence intensity , which corresponded to the Alexa BSA – derived ﬂ uorescence . Thus , within 10 minutes of vesicle forma - tion , the ﬂ uorescence intensity in the red channel gradually decreased by 41 6 5 % , whereas the green channel , which indi - cated coendocytosed LY , remained un - changed ( n = 7 each ) ( Figure 7 , A – C ) . We further investigated the ﬂ uorescent dyes as a function of pH in vitro . When incu - bated at pH values of 7 . 2 , 6 . 0 , 5 . 0 , 4 . 5 , and 4 . 0 for 10 minutes , we found a linear decline in the ﬂ uorescence intensity of Alexa BSA with decreasing pH of the solu - tion ( r 2 = 0 . 90 ; P , 0 . 001 ) . In contrast , the ﬂ uorescence intensity of LY was indepen - dent of the pH ( r 2 = 0 . 007 ; NS ) ( Figure 7C ) . A decrease in the ﬂ uorescence intensity of Alexa BSA of approximately 40 % corre - sponded to a pH of 4 . 5 compared with a pH of 7 . 2 , which is similar to the content of lysosomal vesicles . 19 Furthermore , the in vivo application of LysoTracker , a marker of acidi ﬁ ed compartments , revealed that the albumin - containing vesicles colocalized with LysoTracker ( Figure 7E ) . Albumin - Containing Vesicles Are Released into the Urinary Space The second subset of vesicles grew quickly in size , migrated from the capillary to the urinary aspect of the podocytes , and was eventually released into the urinary space ( Figure 8 ) . As a consequence , ﬂ oating albumin – containing vesicles could be observed on detachment from podocytes ( Figure 8E ) . The transpodocyte passage was a highly dynamic process and oc - curred within 3 . 5 6 0 . 6 minutes ( n = 10 ) of the vesicle appear - ance . The ﬂ uorescence intensities within this subset of vesicles did not change signi ﬁ cantly over time ( 100 % at baseline versus Figure 3 .

This ﬁ nding could be because of the rapid and dynamic transcellular transport of their albumin content into the urinary space . Furthermore , the considerable increase in size observed in some vesicles was caused by the docking and fusion of smaller vesicles with larger ones ( Figure 8B ) . Electron microscopy of Ang II – infused rats further revealed single albumin – containing vesicles bending into the urinary space ( Figure 9A ) , and subsequently , numerousdetachedalbumin – containing vesicles were found in the Bowman ’ s space ( Figure 9B ) . On the basis ofthe average surface area ofthe released vesicleof190 m m 2 , the release of albumin - containing vesicles by podocytes into Bowman ’ s space will lead to a considerable membrane loss . Nev - ertheless , no apparent podocyte cell shrinkage was observed , suggesting an ef ﬁ cient membrane resynthesis . Podocyte Albumin Release in Response to Acute Ang II Infusion Is Not Associated with Cell Death Ang II exposure and albumin endocytosis have been reported to induce apoptosis in podocytes . 20 , 21 Therefore , we next investigated if albumin release by podo - cytes in our experimental setup of acute Ang II – mediated albumin endocytosis may be related to apoptosis / necrosis . To la - bel functionally compromised cell nuclei , we injected propidium iodide before Ang II infusion . Although there was abundant podocyte albumin endocytosis during in - fusion of 80 ng / kg per minute Ang II , no propidium iodide – positive cells were de - tected within the glomerulus ( Figure 10A ) . In contrast to what was observed during Ang II infusion , propidium iodide accumulated in the nuclei of podocytes and other glomerular cells on laser – induced tis - sue lesions ( Figure 10C ) . Quantitative Analysis of Plasma Albumin Endocytosis by Podocytes Endocytosed plasma albumin was subject to either acidi ﬁ cation / degradation or release into the urinary space . We next determined the relative contribution of albumin release versus vesicular acidi ﬁ cation on the basis of thefollowingcalculation . Themeanvesicular Alexa Fluor 594 albumin ﬂ uorescence in - tensity during infusion of 80 ng / kg per minute Ang II was 15 , 603 6 945 relative Units ( rU ) ( n = 33 ) . The volume of vesicles before release averaged 0 . 00024 6 6 . 7 3 10 2 5 nl . A subset of 47 . 4 % of the investigated po - docytes performed albumin release , and the average number of release events per release - positive podocyte within 20 minutes was 1 . 78 6 0 . 24 . The number of podocytes per rat glomerulus is ap - proximately 380 . 22 Consequently , the total released volume per glomerulus was 0 . 474 3 380 3 1 . 78 3 0 . 00024 = 0 . 076 nl . Accord - ingly , the total amount ( volume 3 ﬂ uorescence intensity ) of transcellular albumin ﬁ ltration per glomerulus within 20 min - utes was 0 . 076 nl 3 15 , 603 rU = 1190 nl 3 rU . The average vol - ume of acidi ﬁ ed vesicles was 2 . 7 3 10 2 5 6 7 . 1 3 10 2 6 nl . Within a timeframe of 20 minutes , 68 . 4 % of the podocytes in the ﬁ eld showed an average of 1 . 77 6 0 . 31 albumin - containing vesicles per cell . Consequently , the amount of albumin , which was sub - ject to vesicular acidi ﬁ cation , was 0 . 68 3 380 3 1 . 77 3 2 . 7 3 10 2 5 nl 3 15 , 603 = 194 nl 3 rU . In summary , 86 % [ 1190 / ( 1190 + 194 ) ] of the endocytosed albumin was released into the urinary space on transcellular movement , whereas 14 % was acidi ﬁ ed and pre - sumably degraded . Relative Contribution of Transcellular Versus Paracellular Albumin Filtration Because our study suggested that Ang II induced transcellular albumin ﬁ ltration , we aimed to quantify the relative contri - bution of transcellular and paracellular albumin ﬁ ltration Figure 4 .

During infusion of 80 ng / kg per minute Ang II , the mean ﬂ uorescence intensity of Alexa Fluor 594 albumin in Bowman ’ s space was 51 . 1 6 11 . 1 rU ( n = 27 ) . Assuming a single nephron glomerular ﬁ ltration rate of 11 nl / min during Ang II infusion , 5 the total amount of albumin ﬁ ltered along the paracellular pathway per glomerulus was 51 . 1 rU 3 11 nl / min 3 20 min = 11 , 251 nl 3 rU . With the amount of transcellular ﬁ ltered albumin ( 1190 nl 3 rU ) , the transcellular / paracellular albumin ﬁ ltration ratio was 1190 / 11 , 251 = 0 . 106 . Thus , during Ang II infusion , approximately 10 % of the total albumin ﬁ ltration involved transcellular movement . Urinary Vesicles Contain Plasma Albumin and Proteins from the Apical Membrane of Podocytes Considering the release of endocytosed al - bumin , we next isolated albumin - containing vesiclesfromtheurineofAngII – infusedrats . The urinary albumin – containing vesicles were investigated using MPM and revealed the existence of small vesicular structures containing the albumin – conjugated ﬂ uo - rescent dye ( Figure 11A ) . In addition to FITC - labeled albumin , the urinary vesicles contained programmed cell death 6 inter - acting protein , an established exosomes marker protein , 23 and the podocyte apical membrane protein podocalyxin , whereas podocyte foot process protein podocin was absent , which was determined by Western blotting ( Figure 11 , B – D ) . DISCUSSION We recently used MPM to show that acute Ang II infusion increases the sieving co - ef ﬁ cient for albumin in the normal glo - merulus and that this effect of Ang II is largely pressure independent . 5 Here , we as - sessed the consequences of the increased ﬂ ow of albumin across the ﬁ ltration barrier for podocyte function . We found that Ang II infusion acutely enhanced the endocyto - sis of albumin by podocytes in a dose - dependentmanner . Wecouldfurthercon ﬁ rm the existence of Ang II – mediated albumin endocytosis by podocytes using immuno - histochemistry and electron microscopy . Glomerular vacuolization is a known phenomenon during proteinuria and has beenreportedinhumanswithFSGS . 24 Data obtained from human , rat , and mouse kid - neys suggested that plasma proteins , such as IgG , ferritin , and albumin , may be local - ized in podocyte vacuoles . 8 , 17 , 25 – 30 Commensurate with these ﬁ ndings , podocytes were suggested to clear the glomerular ﬁ ltration barrier from proteins . 17 Our results are in agreement with these studies and further reveal that an Ang II – mediated increase in albumin ﬂ ux across the glomerular membrane en - hances the endocytosis of albumin by podocytes in the normal glomerulus . More importantly , our results , for the ﬁ rst time , show that this process is megalin dependent and visualized that the endocytosed albumin may be released into the urinary space by podocytes . The multiligand receptor megalin plays an essential role in the reabsorption of ﬁ ltered albumin by the proximal tubule . Figure 5 .

Furthermore , our data showed that albumin is located in vesicle - like structures , which colo - calized with megalin within the podocytes . Using MPM , we showed that the Ang II – mediated endocytosis of albumin by podocytes was signi ﬁ cantly reduced by about 90 % when the animals were pretreated with gentamicin , a competitive megalin inhibitor . These results suggest that the in vivo endocy - tosis of albumin by podocytes occurs in a megalin - dependent manner . The Ang II – mediated formation of albumin - containing vesicles occurred on the luminal side of the podocytes and was accompanied by an increase of the albumin concentration in the SP . The Ang II doses used in this study caused a slight decrease in glomerular capillary ﬂ ow . A reduction in ﬂ ow fa - vors the diffusion of macromolecules , such as proteins , over a biologic membrane , 34 , 35 and this biophysic effect may con - tribute to the rise in the albumin concentration in the SP . We conclude that the increased albumin ﬂ ux over the glomer - ular ﬁ ltration barrier may trigger the podocytes to endocytose the increased amount of albumin and consequently , clear the ﬁ lter . Accordingly , the transcellular transport of albumin along the podocyte cell body may be signi ﬁ cantly involved in the reported Ang II – mediated increase in the albumin siev - ing coef ﬁ cient and subsequently , the rise in urinary albumin excretion . 5 Contraction of the podocyte foot processes in re - sponse to Ang II may further modulate the paracellular ﬂ ux of albumin and consequently , alter its concentration in the SP . 36 Congruent with this assumption , we found that the albumin concentrations in the SP were increased when the animals were pretreated with gentamicin , suggesting again that the clearance function of podocytes is megalin dependent . In - creased concentrations of albumin in the SP during Ang II infusion may also , in part , be related to Ang II – induced changes in the barrier function of the endothelium and its glycocalyx . 37 Thus , alterations in the composition and thick - ness of the glomerular endothelial glycocalyx may increase the leakiness of the ﬁ ltration barrier for plasma proteins without changes in podocyte function . 38 , 39 Such changes in the barrier function of the endothelium may , for example , be caused by an increased local generation of reactive oxygen species and changes in local vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) concentration . Podocytes generate reactive oxygen species in response to Ang II , and Ang II has been shown to induce VEGF synthesis in podocytes through the p38 MAP kinase path - way . 40 , 41 Furthermore , podocyte – speci ﬁ c VEGF – de ﬁ cient mice are proteinuric without apparent podocyte damage . 42 In accordance with a clearance function of podocytes , the blockade of the fetal Fc fragment receptor , which is relevant for intracellular albumin vesicle sorting , caused a reduction in proteinuria in nephrotic rats . 25 Furthermore , fetal Fc fragment receptor - de ﬁ cient mice accumulated IgG in the glomerular basement membrane , further supporting the assumption that podocytes have a clearance function for the glomerular ﬁ ltration barrier . 16 , 17 We found that endocytosed albumin is partly localized in acid cell compartments , which colocalized with the lysosomal marker LysoTracker in vivo . We , therefore , conclude that po - docytes may degrade albumin in lysosome – like acidi ﬁ ed vesi - cles . In keeping with this interpretation , cultured human urine – derived , podocyte – like epithelial cells were shown to degrade albumin in lysosomes . 43 In addition to lysosomal deg - radation , we showed that albumin is subject to a transcellular transport through the podocyte into the urinary space . Trans - cellular transport of proteins by podocytes has been suggested as a novel pathway of protein ﬁ ltration during states of dis - ease 25 and a potential mechanism of protein clearance from the SP . 17 Nevertheless , the phenomenon itself has never been visualized in vivo . Our results showed that , in addition to the classic paracellular pathway , albumin is transported into the urinary space along the transcellular pathway and that this pathway accounts for approximately 10 % of the total glomer - ular albumin ﬁ ltration . Our MPM and electron microscopy data further suggest that the actual mechanism of transcellular ﬁ ltration includes the release of albumin - containing vesicles . Figure 6 .

These vesicles could be ob - served when ﬂ oating in Bowman ’ s space after being released by podocytes . Accordingly , we isolated albumin - containing vesicles from the urine of Ang II – infused rats . These urinary vesicles contained podocalyxin , suggesting they were derived from the apical mem - brane of podocytes . 44 However , podocin , which is predominantly expressed in the podocyte foot processes , was absent from urinary vesicles . This ﬁ nding is congruent with the observations made by in vivo im - aging and the use of electron microscopy , suggesting that the release of albumin - containing vesicles was limited to the apical aspect of podocyte cell bodies . On the basis of results of the propidium iodide experiments , necrosis or late - stage apoptosis most likely is not the cause for the release of large albumin – containing vesi - cles ; however , early apoptotic blebbing needs to be considered as a source of albumin – containing vesicle formation . 45 This assumption is favored , by the in part large size of the albumin - containing vesicles . However , the concentration of albumin in the released vesicles was substantially higher compared with the cytoplasmic con - centration . To our knowledge , endocytotic vesicles are usually not involved in the de - velopment of apoptotic blebs , but blebs are formed directly at the plasma mem - brane . 46 , 47 Furthermore , we observed no membrane protrusions into Bowman ’ s space and no formation of membrane blebs containing low – cytoplasmic albumin con - centrations . Such blebbing events would be readily detectable because of the contrast between the black podocyte cytoplasm and the yellow ﬂ uorescence in Bowman ’ s space during LY infusion . In view of these observations , membrane blebbing pre - sumably is not the primary pathway of al - bumin release by podocytes . Although the exact identity of the albumin - containing vesicles remains to be determined , the endocytosis of albumin by podocytes followed by the release of albu - min in membrane - containing vesicles leads to a net membrane loss . This process pre - sumably is energy inef ﬁ cient and may initiate a long - term deterioration of podo - cyte function when large amounts of plasma proteins are cleared from the ﬁ l - tration barrier . 48 Membrane shedding has been postulated as a sign of podocyte injury . 44 Similar to what was found in proximal tubular cells , 1 in vitro studies in human urine – derived podocytes revealed that an albumin overload triggers a proin ﬂ ammatory response . 21 Furthermore , when rats were infused with a solution containing Figure 7 .

However , on the basis of negative in vivo propidium iodide staining , we consider it un - likely that vesicular albumin release by podocytes in the acute settings of our study was related to cellular injury . Nevertheless , the phenomenon of albumin transcytosis , which in our study , was observed in a healthy kidney , may , in the long run , initiate podocyte injury . To our knowledge , this report provides the ﬁ rst in vivo evidence for the release of albumin - containing vesicles by po - docytes . Although the paracellular pathway through the slit diaphragm is considered to be the classic pathway into the urinary space for proteins that have crossed the endothelium and the basement membrane , the transcellular passage across podocytes seems to constitute a new pathway across the ﬁ ltra - tion barrier . These in vivo observations are congruent with the ﬁ ndings in immortalized human podocytes in vitro . Thus , cultured human podocytes performed caveolae – dependent albumin endocytosis and alternatively , ly - sosomal degradation or transcytosis . 7 In summary , Ang II increases the leak - iness of the glomerular ﬁ ltration barrier for albumin and initiates the endocytosis of albumin by podocytes in an AT1 - and megalin - dependent manner . The increased movement of albumin across the ﬁ ltration barrier is partly mediated by the transport of albumin along the transcellular pathway and likely facilitated by high albumin con - centrations in the SP . Podocytes release albumin - containing vesicles into the uri - nary space on endocytosis . The endocytic activityof podocytes induced by Ang II may participate in the long - term deterioration of podocyte function . 48 From these data , we suggest that a reduction in the podocyte endocytic activity may contribute to the re - noprotective effects of RAS inhibitors in - dependently of their hemodynamic effects . CONCISE METHODS More detailed information can be found in Supplemental Material . Animals The animal experiments used young female MWF rats ( 110 – 160 g ) . Multiphoton Microscopy ImagingproceduresusedaZeissLSM710NLOConfocalFluorescence Microscope ( Carl Zeiss ) with a Chameleon Ultra - II MP Laser ( Coherent ) at 860 nm .

Visualization and Quanti ﬁ cation of Albumin Endocytosis by Podocytes Podocytes were visualized by negative imaging 9 during a continuous infusion of LY ( 5 mg / ml and 2 m l / min ) . To investigate the effects of Ang II on podocyte albumin endocytosis , 1 . 3 m l / g body wt puri ﬁ ed Alexa Fluor 594 albumin solution ( Invitrogen ) 5 was injected , and increasing doses ( 10 , 30 , 60 , and 80 ng / kg per minute ) Ang II ( Phoe - nix Pharmaceuticals ) were each infused for 30 minutes . Z stacks of ﬁ ve to seven glomeruli per animal and per dose of Ang II were ac - quired . To analyze the fate of the endocytic vesicles within a single Figure 9 .

To investigate the role of the AT1 receptor , losartan ( 9 . 9 m g / kg body wt ) was injected intravenously before starting the Ang II infusion in ﬁ ve experiments . Five animals were pretreated with gentamicin , a competi - tiveinhibitorofmegalin , for5days ( 100mg / kgperdayintraperitoneally ) before the Ang II dose response experiments . In a second experimental setup , gentamicinwas continuously infused intravenously ( 33 mg / kg per hour ) during the experiment starting 1 hour before the Ang II infusion . For in vivo colocalization studies of albumin and acid cell com - partments , vasculature was labeled using FITC – albumin conjugate ( 40 mg / ml , 1 . 5 m l / g body wt ; Sigma - Aldrich ) , and acid cell compart - ments were stained with 30 m l per animal 1 : 5 diluted LysoTracker solution ( Invitrogen ) . To address possible apoptotic effects of Ang II on the podocytes , propidium iodide ( 0 . 66 mg / kg body wt ; Invitrogen ) was injected 30 minutes before the Ang II infusion . As a positive control , a laser - induced lesion ( 900 nm , 70 % laser power , maximal zoom , 2 seconds of laser exposure ) was set within the glomerulus to visualize the propidium iodide staining of nonvital cell nuclei . Quanti ﬁ cation of the Contribution of Paracellular Versus Transcellular Albumin Filtration First , mean ﬂ uorescenceintensitiesofAlexaFluor594albuminwithin the Bowman ’ s space , the glomerularcapillary lumen , and endocytotic vesicles were empiricallydetermined during fourexperiments of con - tinuous infusion of 80 ng / kg per minute Ang II . Second , the mean vesicular volume before release into Bowman ’ s space and the volume of acidi ﬁ ed vesicles were measured by three - dimensional reconstruc - tion using AMIRA 5 . 4 . 5 . The percentage of endocytotic active podo - cytes on the basis of the total number of identi ﬁ able podocytes was calculated . From this subset of podocytes , we extrapolated to the total number of podocytes / glomerulus on the basis of data in the litera - ture . 22 Third , within a Z stack over 20 minutes , we determined the average shedding events and the number of acidi ﬁ ed vesicle . To esti - mate the single - nephron GFR during Ang II infusion , we referred to our own published data . 5 Glomerular Capillary Flow The dose - dependent effects of Ang II on glomerular capillary ﬂ ow velocity were determined using MPM . 49 A Z stack of each glomerulus was acquired to determine the diameter of the capillaries and calcu - late the glomerular capillary ﬂ ow . Image Analyses In total , 10 representative layers of the Z stack were analyzed . Amira 5 . 4 . 5 ( Visualization Sciences Group ) was used to reconstruct and calculate the volume of the albumin - containing vesicles . Z stacks over time were analyzed using the ZEN2010 software . In Vitro Analysis of Fluorescent Dyes To investigate the pH sensitivity of the ﬂ uorescent probes , stock solutions of LYand Alexa BSAwere each diluted in PBS of pH 7 . 2 , 6 . 0 , 5 . 0 , 4 . 5 , and 4 . 0 . The solutions were incubated at 37°C for 10 minutes before ﬂ uorescent intensities were measured using a Nano Drop 3300 Fluorospectrometer ( Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c ) . Antibodies Immunostainings were performed for light microscopy and electron microscopy . The following primary antibodies were used : rabbit antipodocin IgG ( 1 : 200 ; Sigma - Aldrich ) , guinea pig antimegalin IgG 50 ( 1 : 100 ) , goat antialbumin IgG ( 1 : 500 or 1 : 50 ; Abcam , Inc . ) , and rabbit anticaveolin - 1 IgG ( 1 : 100 ; Abcam , Inc . ) . As secondary anti - bodies for immunostainings , either Alexa Fluor 488 or Rhodamin ( TRITC ) – conjugateddonkeyanti – rabbitIgG ( JacksonImmunoResearch Laboratories ) , and Cy2 – conjugated goat anti – guinea pig IgG ( Abcam , Inc . ) were used . For electron microscopy , Alexa Fluor 488 and 1 . 4 - nm gold – conjugated rabbit F ( ab ) anti – goat ( 1 : 50 ; Abcam , Inc . ) were used . Figure 10 .

Subsequently , the ﬁ xed kidneys were processed for either electron microscopy or paraf ﬁ n sections . Human paraf ﬁ n – embedded kidney tissue was a gift from Stephan Reinhold . Immunostaining For light microscopy , perfusion - ﬁ xed kidneys were embedded in paraf ﬁ n , sliced ( 2 – 5 m m ) , and stained . The staining was then visual - ized with an Axiovert Observer Microscope ( Carl Zeiss ) . For electron microscopy , kidneys were embedded in LR White Resin ; 100 - nm - thick sections were sliced and collected on single – slot pioloform nickel grids before staining and visualized using a JEOL JEM - 2100F Feldemissions - Transmissionselektronenmikroskop ( Jeol ) . Plasma Ang II Levels Plasmawas obtained by tail bleeding before and immediately after the Ang II dose - response experiments . To stabilize the peptide , aprotinin ( 10 m l per 100 m l blood ; Sigma - Aldrich ) was added to the blood sample before centrifugation for 20 minutes at 4°C . Ang II levels in the plasma were then mea - sured by an Angiotensin II ELISA ( Phoenix Pharmaceuticals ) according to the manufactur - er ’ s instructions . Urinary Vesicles Isolation Albumin - containing vesicles were isolated from the urine of Ang II – infused rats using total exo - somes isolation reagent ( Invitrogen ) or by ultra - centrifugation . To visualize the albumin content of urinary albumin – containing vesicles , some of the rats were injected with either Alexa BSA or FITC – albumin before Ang IIinfusion . The ﬂ uo - rescent albumin in the vesicles was then visual - ized by either MPM or a Fusion Fx7 Spectra Imager ( Vilba ) after plotting on a 10 % SDS - PAGE gel . Western Blotting For the identi ﬁ cation of marker proteins of the urinary vesicles , electrophoresis of the samples was performed on a 10 % or 7 % SDS - PAGE gel and then transferred to a nitrocellulose mem - brane ( Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c ) . The following primary antibodies were used : rabbit antipodo - cin IgG ( 1 : 50 ; Sigma - Aldrich ) , rabbit antipodo - calyxin ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , and goat anti – programmed cell death 6 interacting pro - tein IgG ( 1 : 50 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) . La - beled secondary antibodies were visualized using Pierce ECL Plus Western Blotting Substrate ( Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c ) according to the man - ufactures ’ instructions . Statistical Analyses Data were further analyzed by ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test using Graph Pad Prism 5 ( GraphPad Software ) . All data are given as means 6 SEM . P , 0 . 05 was considered signi ﬁ cant . Study Approval All of the animal experiments were conducted according to the National Institutes of Health ’ s Guidelines for the Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by local authorities .
