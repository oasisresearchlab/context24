REVIEW Directly watching biomolecules in action by high - speed atomic force microscopy Toshio Ando 1 , 2 Received : 3 April 2017 / Accepted : 14 July 2017 / Published online : 31 July 2017 # International Union for Pure and Applied Biophysics ( IUPAB ) and Springer - Verlag GmbH Germany 2017 Abstract Proteins are dynamic in nature and work at the sin - gle molecule level . Therefore , directly watching protein mol - ecules in dynamic action at high spatiotemporal resolution must be the most straightforward approach to understanding how they function . To make this observation possible , high - speed atomic force microscopy ( HS - AFM ) has been devel - oped . Its current performance allows us to film biological molecules at 10 – 16 frames / s , without disturbing their func - tion . In fact , dynamic structures and processes of various pro - teins have been successfully visualized , including bacteriorho - dopsin responding to light , myosin V walking on actin fila - ments , and even intrinsically disordered proteins undergoing order / disorder transitions . The molecular movies have provid - ed insights that could not have been reached in other ways . Moreover , the cantilever tip can be used to manipulate mole - cules during successive imaging . This capability allows us to observe changes in molecules resulting from dissection or perturbation . This mode of imaging has been successfully applied to myosin V , peroxiredoxin and doublet microtubules , leading to new discoveries . Since HS - AFM can be combined with other techniques , such as super - resolution optical micros - copy and optical tweezers , the usefulness of HS - AFM will be further expanded in the near future . Keywords Imaging . High - speed AFM . Proteins . Dynamic processes . Structural changes Introduction Proteins are the structural and functional elements of life . Understanding how proteins produce complex biological ar - chitectures and phenomena is one of central issues in life sciences . To this end , two main approaches have been used : dynamics analysis and structural analysis . Single - molecule biophysical approaches have been devised to detect dynamic behavior of protein molecules ( e . g . , Deniz et al . 2008 ; Capitanio and Pavone 2013 ) . However , the methods are all based on optical techniques , and , therefore , can only detect the dynamic behavior of optical markers attached to proteins ( i . e . protein molecules themselves are invisible even with super - resolution ) . X - ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic reso - nance ( NMR ) have been most instrumental in the structural analysis of proteins at the atomic level . The former is only applicable to crystallized proteins , whereas the latter is appli - cable to proteins in solution and even in living cells , but it is limited to molecular masses smaller than ~ 40 kDa . Recent advances in cryo - electron microscopy ( cryo - EM ) have now allowed the determination of atomic structure of proteins from many images of individual molecules in ice ( Wang et al . 2015 ) . However , the structural information acquired with these three structural methods is limited to static snapshots of proteins . An X - ray - free electron laser can break this limi - tation and reveal the time - resolved atomic structure of proteins ( Nango et al . 2016 ) , but it is only applicable to limited targets . Under these circumstances , a new microscopy technique is needed that allows direct and dynamic visualization of protein molecules even if the resolution is moderate . Atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) is a unique , potential candidate for such This article is part of a Special Issue on ‘ IUPAB Edinburgh Congress ’ edited by Damien Hall * Toshio Ando tando @ staff . kanazawa - u . ac . jp 1 Bio - AFM Frontier Research Center , Institute of Science and Engineering , Kanazawa University , Kakuma - machi , Kanazawa 920 - 1192 , Japan 2 CREST , Japan Science and Technology Agency , Tokyo 102 - 0075 , Japan Biophys Rev ( 2017 ) 9 : 421 – 429 DOI 10 . 1007 / s12551 - 017 - 0281 - 7 a technique . AFM allows sub - atomic resolution imaging of flat objects in high vacuum , whereas its resolution is lowered to a sub - molecular level when AFM is applied to biological molecules in solution . AFM does not have sufficient time resolution since it takes at least 1 min to acquire an image . This is not a theoretical limitation , but a practical one . Efforts to achieve high - speed ( HS ) AFM were independently initiated around 1993 by the Hansma group ( Viani et al . 2000 ) and the Ando group . Practical HS - AFM for biological studies was established around 2008 ( Ando et al . 2008 ) following im - provements to the first prototype system ( Ando et al . 2001 ) . Since then , the dynamics of proteins have been successfully visualized ( Ando et al . 2014 ) . The functionality of HS - AFM is now being expanded in various ways by a combination of other techniques . For example , dynamic phenomena occur - ring on living cells can also be imaged using a combined HS - AFM / fluorescence microscopy system equipped with a fast wide - area scanner ( Watanabe et al . 2013 ; Shibata et al . 2015 ) . In this review , I give an overview of the principles , biological applications , and future prospects of HS - AFM . Imaging rate For AFM imaging of biological samples , it is common to use the tapping - mode , where the cantilever is excited to oscillate at its first resonant frequency . The oscillating tip intermittently contacts with the surface , resulting in alteration of the cantile - ver ’ s oscillation amplitude and phase . Deflection of the canti - lever is detected with an optical beam deflection detector in which a laser beam reflected back from the cantilever illumi - nates a position - sensitive photodetector ( Fig . 1 ) . The laser spot on the photodetector moves up and down as the cantile - ver oscillates . During the raster - scanning of the sample stage in the X – Y direction , the amplitude of the cantilever oscillation ( and hence , the tip – sample interaction force ) is held constant by moving the sample stage in the Z - direction via a feedback control . The feedback signal that is proportional to the scanner Z - displacement is used to form a topography image of the sample surface . Note that the intermittent tip – sample contact avoids the sample being dragged laterally by the tip . The highest possible imaging rate of AFM is a function of various parameters , as described below ( Ando et al . 2013 ) . For simplicity , let us assume that the sample has a sinusoidal shape in the X – Z plane , characterized by a periodicity λ and a peak height h 0 ( Fig . 2 ) . When this sample is scanned in the X - direction with velocity V s and the feedback controller is switched off , the sample height h under the cantilever tip changes with time as h t ð Þ ¼ 1 2 h 0 sin 2 π ft ð Þ ; ð 1 Þ where f ≡ V s / λ . When the feedback controller is switched on , the Z - scanner is moved sinusoidally at the feedback frequency f in the direction opposite to the sample height . However , because of the chasing - after nature of feedback control , the Z - scanner moves with a time delay τ 0 as Z t ð Þ ¼ − 1 2 h 0 sin 2 π ft − θ 0 ð Þ ; ð 2 Þ Fig . 1 Schematic of tapping - mode atomic force microscope . The cantilever is excited with a piezo to oscillate at the first resonance frequency . Deflections of the cantilever are detected by a position sensor ( bi - cell or quadrant photodetector ) that is sensitive to the position of the laser spot reflecting back from the cantilever 422 Biophys Rev ( 2017 ) 9 : 421 – 429 where θ 0 ≡ 2 π f τ 0 is the phase delay of feedback control . Because of this delay , we always have a feedback error Δ Z , which is given by Δ Z ¼ h t ð Þ þ Z t ð Þ ¼ h 0 sin θ 0 . 2 (cid:2) (cid:3) cos 2 π ft − θ 0 . 2 (cid:2) (cid:3) ð 3 Þ Due to this error , the tip – sample interaction force varies . The feedback bandwidth f B is usually defined by the feedback frequency at which the π / 4 phase delay occurs , and , hence , given by f B = 1 / ( 8 τ 0 ) . Assuming that the phase delay up to θ max creates no practical problems for the sample , the X - scan - ner can be scanned at the highest rate , V smax = λ f B × ( 4 θ max / π ) . Therefore , the highest possible imaging rate R max is given by R max ¼ 2 θ max λ f B . π WN ð Þ ð 4 Þ where W is the scan range in the X - direction and N is the number of scan lines . For example , under a realistic condition for imaging protein molecules by our HS - AFM , f B = 110 kHz , θ max = π / 9 ( i . e . , 20° ) , λ = 10 nm , W = 150 nm and N = 100 , Eq . 4 gives R max = 16 . 3 frames per second ( fps ) . Note that R max depends on the sample fragility and spatial frequency of the surface corrugation to be detected , 1 / λ , in the sample . As demonstrated in the studies of GroEL – GroES ( Yamamoto and Ando 2016 ) and immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) - antibody ( Preiner et al . 2014 ) interactions , the kinetics or strength of protein – pro - tein interaction can be estimated from successive AFM images . Here , I briefly estimate how strong or weak protein – protein in - teractions can be measured by HS - AFM imaging . From succes - sive images , we can estimate k on and k off and hence the corre - sponding dissociation constant K d in a certain range . For an exponential decay process with a rate constant k , where the prob - ability density function for an unbound or bound state is described as P ( t ) = ( 1 / k ) × Exp ( − kt ) , AFM imaging has to be performed at a frame rate of at least 4 – 5 × k / π , considering the Fourier transform of P ( t ) , 1 / [ 1 + ( ω / k ) 2 ] . Therefore , at the highest possible imaging rate for proteins ( ~ 16 fps ) , the largest k that can be estimated by HS - AFM imaging is 10 – 12 s − 1 . On the other hand , it is difficult to observe very slow processes . Stable suc - cessive imaging can only be performed for ~ 10 min . Supposing that ~ 60 binding or dissociation events are observed during 10 min recording ( we need such a number of events in one experiment ) , the smallest measurable k is ~ 0 . 1 s − 1 . To measure k on ( second - order rate constant ) , we have to change the concen - tration of one protein in bulk solution , while the counterpart is attached to the substrate surface . When the surface is resistive to non - specific protein binding , we can increase its concentration up to 1 μ M or slightly higher , as demonstrated by Yamamoto and Ando ( 2016 ) . Floating molecules in bulk solution do not interfare with AFM imaging , so long as the cantilever tip does not adhere to the molecules . On the other hand , we can onlydecrease the concentration down to ~ 1 nM . Therefore , the measureable k on by HS - AFM is approxiamtely 10 5 – 10 10 M − 1 s − 1 , and the K d that can be estimated by HS - AFM imaging is approximately in the range of 10 − 4 – 10 − 11 M under the restrictions of 0 . 1 s − 1 < k off < 12 s − 1 and 10 5 M − 1 s − 1 < k on < 10 10 M − 1 s − 1 . Components optimized for HS - AFM The speed performance of a HS - AFM system ( including can - tilevers ) is defined only by the value of f B . To increase f B , the response speed of all devices , particularly mechanical devices ( cantilevers and scanners ) , has to be increased . Moreover , the parasitic oscillations that can be produced by fast displace - ment of the scanner have to be minimized , and techniques to λ / V h 0 s Time a b Time A 0 0 A 0 r τ 0 Fig . 2 Feedback displacement of Z - scanner and error caused by feedback delay .

Here , I briefly summarize the major components developed to achieve these conditions ( see Ando et al . ( 2008 ) for a detailed description of instrumentation and Uchihashi et al . ( 2012 ) for the detailed protocols of HS - AFM imaging . ) ( 1 ) Small Si 3 N 4 cantilevers : The cantilever dimensions are 7 μ m long , 2 μ m wide and 90 nm thick . Their mechanical properties are : resonant frequency f c = 1 . 2 MHz in water , quality factor Q c = 2 in water , and spring constant k c = 0 . 2 N / m , resulting in a response time , Q c / ( π f c ) = 0 . 53 μ s . As the tip of the small cantilevers is not sharp enough , an electron beam - deposited tip is grown on the original tip and then sharpened by plasma etching . Small cantilevers with similar values of k c and lower values of f c are commercially available from NanoWorld ( f c = 400 kHz in water ) and Olympus ( f c = 600 – 800 kHz in water ) . ( 2 ) Fast amplitude detectors : The cantilever oscillation am - plitude is measured and output by a Fourier method at every cycle of oscillation , using a 100 - MHz A / D converter , a field - programmable gate array and a digital signal processor . ( 3 ) Fast scanners : High - frequency displacement of a piezo - actuator has a large impact on its supporting mechanism , which tends to generate unwanted mechanical vibra - tions . To counteract the impulsive force and thereby min - imize unwanted vibrations , two identical Z - piezoactuators are placed at a supporting base in the op - posite direction and displaced simultaneously with the same length . To further minimize unwanted vibrations , we developed an active damping technique based on Q - control . The resulting response time of the Z - scanner is 0 . 5 – 0 . 8 μ s , comparable to that of the small cantilevers . ( 4 ) Dynamic proportional - integral - derivative ( PID ) controllers : In order to allow weak tip – sample contact , the set point amplitude A s should be very close to the free oscillation amplitude A 0 . However , at this setting , the tip tends to detach from the surface completely at the downhill regions of the surface . Once detached , it takes a long time for the tip to make contact with the surface again , rather like parachuting . To avoid this effect , we developed a dynamic PID controller in which the gain is automatically increased when the downhill regions are scanned ( Kodera et al . 2006 ) . This method allowed the setting of A 0 = 1 – 2 nm and A s = 0 . 9 × A 0 , thus making high - speed imaging com - patible with low - invasive imaging . Impact on sample of tip – sample and surface – sample contacts In HS - AFM imaging of proteins , the molecules are in contact with the substrate surface and tapped with the oscillating tip many times . Obviously , the molecules are not in their innate condition . Therefore , a question arises whether or not the ac - quired images really reflect the original structure and behavior of the molecules . The effect of tip – sample contact can be quantitatively assessed as follows . Here , we do not consider the decrease of cantilever oscillation amplitude induced by its resonant frequency shift upon contact with the sample . Therefore , the magnitude of force or the amount of energy described below may be somewhat smaller . Under the condi - tions usually used for HS - AFM imaging of protein molecules ( A 0 = 1 – 2 nm , A s = 0 . 9 × A 0 , k c = 0 . 1 – 0 . 2 N / m and Q c = 2 ) , the tip - force acting on the sample will on average be : k c × ( A 0 – A s ) / Q c = 5 – 20 pN . Considering a possible feedback error ( Eq . 3 ) , a larger force ( roughly , 40 – 90 pN ) is occasionally exerted on the sample during its uphill stroke . This range of magnitude of force may be too large , but the mechanical quantity that affects the sample is not force itself but impulse ( force × force - acting time ) . The force - acting time is very short , ~ 100 ns or less , because the cantilever is oscillated in the Z - direction at ~ 1 MHz . Therefore , the magnitude of the impulse is less than 10 − 17 N s per tap . The impact of tip - tapping can also be esti - mated by the amount of energy transferred from the cantilever to the sample . The cantilever oscillation energy lost at every tip – sample contact , 1 / 2 k c ( A 02 – A s2 ) / Q c , is 0 . 5 – 3 . 8 × 10 − 20 J on average ( 1 . 2 – 9 . 2 k B T , where k B is the Boltzmann constant and T is room temperature in Kelvin ) . The transferred energy , which dissipates quickly , is partitioned between freedoms in the molecule . Even the total amount of energy is identical to or less than the free energy liberated by the hydrolysis of one ATP molecule . The lateral force applied from the tip to the sample is negligible . During the tip – sample contact ( ~ 100 ns ) , the sample is dragged by the tip because the sample is scanned in the X direction , relative to the tip . The scan speed is ~ 2 × 10 − 4 m / s for a frame rate 10 fps , scan area 100 × 100 nm 2 , and the number of scan lines 100 . Therefore , the distance by which the sample is dragged in the X - direction is ~ 0 . 02 nm or less . Compared to the tip – sam - ple interaction , it is difficult to know a priori if the substrate surface would affect the sample . It depends on the sample and phenomenon to be observed . Therefore , we have to judge it from observed results . HS - AFM imaging of biological molecules in action AFM can visualize objects only from one direction ( perpen - dicular to the substrate surface ) . Molecules diffusing very fast on the substrate surface cannot be imaged even with HS - AFM . When two molecules interacting with each other are immobilized on a substrate , their interaction is restricted . Therefore , to visualize protein molecules in action , we need to optimize assay conditions , including the substrate surface ( Yamamoto et al . 2010 ) , buffer solution , and the sample itself . 424 Biophys Rev ( 2017 ) 9 : 421 – 429 By devising assay conditions appropriate for individual spe - cific proteins and phenomena , HS - AFM has had great success in visualizing various proteins in action ( see review , Ando et al . 2014 ) , as listed in Table 1 . Here , I briefly highlight some results obtained in my laboratory and by others ( Fig . 3 ) . Myosin V The most striking HS - AFM observations were per - formed using myosin V ( M5 ) ( Kodera et al . 2010 ; Kodera and Ando 2014 ) . M5 moves processively on actin filaments with a step size of ~ 36 nm , in a hand - over - hand manner . These fea - tures of M5 motility were deduced mostly from single - molecule optical measurements . However , how the chemical energy of ATP is used during walking has been deduced from ensemble measurements on muscle myosins , and considerd to be basically the same for M5 . According to a widely accepted model , the tension for forward movement of M5 is generated when Pi is released from the ADP – Pi - bound leading head upon attachment to actin . This generated tension drives the forward swing of the leading head . Therefore , it has been postulated that the ADP – Pi - bound head is in a high - energy state and that , upon Pi release , this energy is used to drive the lever arm swing as the powerstroke . Therefore , the ADP - bound head is considered to be in a low - energy state . The AFM movies of M5 revealed phenomena inconsistent with this view . In the presence of ATP , the leading head sometimes briefly detached from actin and then reattached , whereas M5 remained at approximately the same position on the filament , like B foot stomping ^ ( Fig . 3a ) . After foot stomping , the trailing head detached and the leading head swung forwards . The leading head that exhibited foot stomping did not carry bound Pi because Pi had already been released when the head initially attached to actin . This peculiar observation suggests that the ADP - bound head can generate tension and execute a powerstroke . This suggestion was reinforced by another ob - servation . In two - headed bound M5 in the presence of ADP , the coiled - coil tail was occasionally unwound , upon which the leading head swung forwards , very much like a powerstroke observed in the presence of ATP . This observation also sug - gests that intra - molecular tension can be generated just by binding of the two heads to actin without chemical energy input , and that the lever arm swing of the leading head spon - taneously occurs upon trailing head detachment to release this intra - molecular tension . Experiments are now underway to provide direct evidence for this new idea . Bacteriorhodopsin The light - driven proton pump bacterio - rhodopsin ( bR ) is the best studied membrane protein . Nevertheless , its dynamic structural change upon light illumi - nation has been elusive . The HS - AFM movie of the D96N bR mutant with slow photocycle showed that , upon light illumi - nation , the cytoplasmic E – F helix portion of each bR displaces outwards by 0 . 7 – 0 . 8 nm ( much larger than expected before ) , resulting in contact with adjacent trimers ( Shibata et al . 2010 ) . Using different light intensities , the frequency of bR – bR con - tact was varied . From this observation , it was revealed that this inter - trimer bR – bR contact engenders both positive and Table 1 Various biomolecular and cellular processes visualized by HS - AFM Motor proteins Myosin V walking on actin filaments ( Kodera et al . 2010 ) Rotary propagation of chemical and structural states in rotor - less F 1 - ATPase ( Uchihashi et al . 2011 ) Membrane proteins Up - down motion of Glutamate transporter ( Ruan et al . 2017 ) Height change in MloK1 cyclic nucleotide - modulated channels ( Kowal et al . 2014 ; Rangl et al . 2016 ) Spiral spring formation by ESCRT protein ( Chiaruttini et al . 2015 ) Stiffness map of membrane protein moieties estimated from thermal motion ( Preiner et al . 2015 ) Diffusion and interaction of outer membrane protein F ( OmpF ) ( Casuso et al . 2012 ) Bacteriorhodopsin responding to light ( Shibata et al . 2010 ; Yamashita et al . 2013 ) ATP - induced height changeof Ca 2 + pump ( Yokokawa andTakeyasu2011 ) Molecular chaperones Dynamic GroEL – GroES interaction ( Yamamoto et al . 2016 ) Conformational change of AAA + protein p97 coupled with the ATPase reaction ( Noi et al . 2013 ) EnzymesUnidirectionalmotion ofcellulases on cellulose fibers ( Igarashi et al . 2011 ) Two - way motion of chitinases on crystalline chitin ( Igarashi et al . 2014 ) Polarized movement of collagenase along collagen fibrils ( Watanabe - Nakayama et al . 2016 ) Amyloid fibrils Fibril formation by lithosthatine peptide ( Milhiet et al . 2010 ) Fibril formation by amyloid β 1 – 42 ( Watanabe - Nakayama et al . 2016 ) Intrinsically disordered proteins Structure of FACT protein and effect of phosphorylation ( Miyagi et al . 2008 ; Hashimoto et al . 2013 ) Two - ball structure of the flagellar hook - length control protein FliK ( Kodera et al . 2015 ) Autophagy protein Atg13 undergoing order / disorder transitions ( Yamamoto et al . 2016 ) Analysis of IDP structure at the residue level ( Kodera et al . a ) CytoskeletonsCofilin - induced unidirectional conformational changes in actin filaments ( Ngo et al . 2015 ) Effect of inner microtubule proteins on the stability of doublet microtubules ( Owa et al . a ) AntibodiesWalkingofantibodieson antigensarranged in latticepatterns ( Preiner et al . 2014 ) DNA and DNA - binding proteins Condensin smc2 - smc4 dimers showing variety of conformations ( Eeftens et al . 2016 ) Motion of DNA nano - robots ( Rajendran et al . 2015 ; Wickham et al . 2011 ) Oligomerization and dynamics of APOBEC3G interacting with DNA ( Shlyakhtenko et al . 2013 ) Cells and organelles Moving net - like structure formed by prion covering living bacterial surface ( Yamashita et al . 2012 ; Oestreicher et al . 2015 ) Dynamic morphological changes in living cells ( Shibata et al . 2015 ) Dynamics of nucleoporins inside nuclear porin complexes of Xenopus laevis oocytes ( Sakiyama et al . 2016 ) Responses of bacteria to antimicrobial peptide ( Fantner et al . 2010 ) a Personal communications Biophys Rev ( 2017 ) 9 : 421 – 429 425 negative cooperative effects in the decay kinetics as the initial bR recovers .

F 1 - ATPase The three catalytic β subunits in the rotary motor F 1 - ATPase ( α 3 β 3 γ complex ) ( Noji et al . 1997 ) change their nucleotide states exclusively , i . e . ATP - free , ADP - bound and ATP - bound states . These three states rotationally propagate in one direction over the β subunits ( Boyer 1997 ) .

Because the three β subunits are not in direct contact , the ques - tion was raised how they communicate with each other . It was postulated that the γ subunit dictates the nucleotide states through three different β – γ interactions ( Wang and Oster 1998 ) . HS - AFM imaging of the α 3 β 3 subcomplex in the pres - ence of ATP revealed conformational changes in a defined ro - tary sequence among the three β subunits ( Uchihashi et al . 2011 ) ( Fig . 3c ) . Thus , it was concluded that intrinsic cooperativity elicited through the β – β interplay alone is re - sponsible for torque generation to rotate the γ subunit , and , therefore , the γ subunit is passively subjected to the torque . Intrinsically disordered proteins ( IDPs ) Nearly half of the entire realm of proteins are disordered either entirely or partly ( Uversky et al . 2000 ) . but they function as hubs of cellular signaling and regulation in transcription , translation and cell cycle ( Wright and Dyson 2015 ) . The structure of IDPs is highly flexible as they dynamically sample a multitude of conformational states . Therefore , structural analysis of IDPs is considerably difficult . In fact , X - ray crystallography and EM have no practical application for IDPs . NMR has been most instrumental in the structural analysis of IDPs but it suffers from the inherent ensemble averaging , and hence can hardly single out the individual structures in the conformation - al ensemble . HS - AFM can visualize the thin and flexible structure of intrinsically disordered regions ( IDRs ) in IDPs ( Miyagi et al . 2008 ) . Some IDRs were observed to transit between fully disordered and partially ( or fully ) ordered states , whereas other IDRs were always fully disordered ( Fig . 3d ) . Quantitative analyses of HS - AFM images can provide dy - namic structural information at the residue level ( N . Kodera et al . , personal communication ) . Chaperonin GroEL A double ring - shaped GroEL consisting of 14 ATPase subunits assists protein folding , together with co - chaperonin GroES ( e . g . , Horwich and Fenton 2009 ) . The dynamic GroEL − GroES interaction is actively involved in the chaperonin reaction . Therefore , revealing this dynamic inter - action is a key to understanding the operation principle of GroEL . Nevertheless , how this interaction proceeds in the reaction cycle has long been controversial . HS - AFM images of GroEL – GroES interactions in the presence of ATP and substrate protein revealed the occurrence of the primary sym - metric GroEL : GroES 2 ( football complexes ) and second - primary asymmetric GroEL : GroES 1 ( bullet complexes ) ( Yamamoto and Ando 2016 ) . Thus , the controversial issue is now cleared , demonstrating the importance of direct nano - visualization of dynamic molecular processes . Remarkably , the reaction was observed to often branch into main and side pathways . In the main pathway , alternate binding and release of GroES occurs at the two rings , indicating tight cooperation between the two rings . In the side pathway , however , this cooperation is disrupted , resulting in interruption of the alter - nating rhythm ( Fig . 3e ) . From various properties observed for both pathways , the entire reaction scheme was constructed and a mechanistic insight into the alternate and non - alternate operations of the two - engine system was provided . Sucrose non - fermenting protein 7 ( Snf7 ) Snf7 is a protein of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport ( ESCRT - III ) . It plays a key role in lipid membrane budding and abscission . HS - AFM of Snf7 , when placed on supported planar lipid bilayers , exhibited concentric spiral filament for - mation ( Fig . 3f ) . When they were disrupted by the cantilever tip , the broken polymers spontaneously formed smaller rings , suggesting a preferred diameter of 25 nm for Snf7 as well as B unbending ^ of the spiral filaments from their natural curva - ture ( Chiaruttini et al . 2015 ) . Thus , it was proposed that in cellular conditions energy would be accumulated during the growth of the spiral spring and eventually released through shrinking of the spiral diameter and buckling of the inner spirals , causing the membrane to buckle , bud and undergo abscission . As demonstrated in this study , the tip can also be used to manipulate the objects visualized by HS - AFM . Recently , this tip - manipulation technique was refined to precisely specify the loci within the sample to which a controlled strong force is applied . This method has recently been used to detach either head of M5 from actin , break doublet microtubules , and dis - sect assembled complexes of peroxiredoxin , and then observe resulting changes in their behavior or structure . Immunoglobulin Y - shaped IgG has an Fc stem and two iden - tical Fab arms connected to the stem . IgG binds to epitopes on an antigen at the Fab moiety . The antigens are often arranged in lattice patterns on pathogens , where the epitopes are close to each other . Thus , the question arises : how , and how strong - ly , do the two Fabs bind to their epitopes ? HS - AFM imaging was performed for monoclonal IgG antibodies placed on two - dimensional crystalline protein layers and on a viral capsid ( Preiner et al . 2014 ) . Monovalent Fab fragments bind to anti - gens tightly and not to move on the lattice surfaces . On the other hand , divalent antibodies were observed to walk on the lattice surfaces . Therefore , contrary to expectations , divalent binding is weaker than the monovalent binding . This is be - cause a steric strain is imposed to the divalently bound anti - bodies . This finding will contribute to engineering effective antibodies for therapy and diagnosis . Other studies HS - AFM has been mostly applied to purified protein systems , but it can also be used to observe higher order structures on the surface of living bacteria and on isolated nuclei . It was first shown in the living bacterium , Magnetospirillum magneticum AMB - 1 , that the surface is Biophys Rev ( 2017 ) 9 : 421 – 429 427 covered with a moving net - like structure , mainly composed of porin molecules ( Yamashita et al . 2012 ) . Similar structures formed by assembled porin were confirmed on the surface of other bacteria ( Oestreicher et al . 2015 ) . Recently , the surface of nuclei was observed by HS - AFM ( Sakiyama et al . 2016 ) . Nuclear pore complexes ( NPCs ) act as a central regulator of transport between the nucleus and cytoplasm . NPCs consist of ~ 30 pro - teins , termed nucleoporins . One - third of nucleoporins are intrinsically disordered phenylalanine - glycine strings ( FG Nups ) , which are tethered inside each pore and may play a role in selective barrier and transport mech - anism , but this remains elusive . HS - AFM was used to visualize the spatiotemporal dynamics of nucleoporins inside NPCs of Xenopus laevis oocytes . The cytoplas - mic orifice is circumscribed by highly flexible , dynam - ically fluctuating FG Nups that rapidly elongate and retract . This transient entanglement in the NPC channel manifests as a central plug when averaged in space and time . Further progress of high - speed AFM technologies As highlighted in the above studies , direct visualization of dynamic molecular processes has been a powerful approach . To expand the functionality of HS - AFM , various attempts have been made ( see review , Uchihashi et al . 2016 ) . The recently achieved wide - area / fast scanner allows the observa - tions of dynamic morphological changes in live cells and protein molecules working on the surfaces of bacteria and nuclei . However , for extremely soft eukaryotic cell surfaces , such high - resolution imaging is challenging . This problem is now being solved by the development of high - speed scanning ion conductance microscopy ( HS - SICM ) that can operate without probe − sample contact . The spatial resolution of SICM is now being improved by developing much sharper capillary probes . Moreover , a tip - scan ( not sample stage - scan ) HS - AFM system has been recently developed , which potentially can be combined with various techniques that use the free space available adjacent to the sample . Tip - scan HS - AFM combined with total internal reflection fluorescence mi - croscopy has already been achieved ( Fukuda et al . 2013 ) . We are now trying to combine this with optical tweezers to visu - alize protein molecules under external force . As seen in these examples , HS - AFM , more generally high - speed scanning probe microscopy techniques , will become a major tool in biological research .
