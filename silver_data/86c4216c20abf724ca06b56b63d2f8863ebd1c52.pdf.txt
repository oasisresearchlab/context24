A genetic screen for factors required for en - docytosis in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae previously identified PAN1 . Pan1p is a homologue of the mammalian protein eps15 , which has been impli - cated in endocytosis by virtue of its association with the plasma membrane clathrin adaptor complex AP - 2 . Pan1p contains two eps15 homology ( EH ) domains , a protein – protein interaction motif also present in other proteins that function in membrane trafficking . To ad - dress the role of Pan1p and EH domains in endocytosis , a yeast two - hybrid screen was performed using the EH domain – containing region of Pan1p . This screen identi - fied yAP180A , one of two yeast homologues of a class of clathrin assembly proteins ( AP180 ) that exhibit in vitro clathrin cage assembly activity . In vitro binding studies using GST fusion proteins and yeast extracts de - fined distinct binding sites on yAP180A for Pan1p and clathrin . yAP180 proteins and Pan1p , like actin , localize to peripheral patches along the plasma membrane . Mammalian synaptojanin , a phosphatidylinositol poly - phosphate - 5 - phosphatase , also has been implicated in endocytosis recently , and three synaptojanin - like genes have been identified in yeast . We observed genetic in - teractions between the yeast SJL1 gene and PAN1 , which suggest a role for phosphoinositide metabolites in Pan1p function . Together with other studies , these findings suggest that Pan1p coordinates regulatory in - teractions between proteins required for both endocy - tosis and actin - cytoskeleton organization ; these pro - teins include the yAP180 proteins , clathrin , the ubiquitin – protein ligase Rsp5p , End3p , and synaptoja - nin . We suggest that Pan1p ( and by extension eps15 ) serves as a multivalent adaptor around which dynamic interactions between structural and regulatory compo - nents of the endocytic pathway converge . T he composition of proteins and lipids in the plasma membrane is maintained by selective sorting of plasma membrane components and by regulation of the processes of exocytosis and endocytosis . This ensures proper control of many essential cellular processes such as nutrient uptake and receptor - mediated signal transduc - tion . Newly synthesized plasma membrane proteins and lipids are delivered by exocytosis , whereas other proteins and lipids are removed by endocytosis . Both of these membrane trafficking events are mediated by transport vesicles that form at sites of cargo concentration , separate from the donor membrane , and target to an appropriate acceptor organelle ( Rothman and Orci , 1992 ; Schekman and Orci , 1996 ; for review see Robinson , 1997 ) . The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has proven to be a powerful model system for elucidating membrane - trafficking pathways ; one such pathway is endocytosis . Traditionally , endocytosis in yeast has been monitored by following the internalization of the seven transmembrane domain pheromone receptors , Ste2p and Ste3p ( Davis et al . , 1993 ; Raths et al . , 1993 ) . In addition to numerous end mutants ( e . g . , Raths et al . , 1993 ; Munn and Riezman , 1994 ; Munn et al . , 1995 ) , a temperature - sensitive clathrin heavy chain mutant ( chc ts ) 1 has been shown to exhibit ki - netic defects in pheromone receptor internalization ( Tan et al . , 1993 ) . Clathrin - dependent receptor – mediated en - docytosis is , to date , the best characterized endocytic path - way in both yeast and mammalian cells ( for review see Pearse and Robinson , 1990 ; Schmid , 1997 ) . In this path - way , plasma membrane – localized receptors bind to their ligands and then associate with the heterotetrameric adap - tor complex AP - 2 . AP - 2 in turn recruits and polymerizes Address all correspondence to Beverly Wendland or Scott D .

The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 141 , 1998 72 clathrin , which ultimately leads to the formation of clathrin - coated vesicles . These vesicles then uncoat , the adaptors and clathrin are recycled , and the newly uncoated vesicles dock and fuse with an early endosome . Yeast genes encod - ing clathrin heavy and light chains , as well as subunits of a heterotetrameric adaptor AP - 2 - like complex , have been identified and characterized ( Payne and Schekman , 1985 ; Silveira et al . , 1990 ; Phan et al . , 1994 ; Rad et al . , 1995 ) . Ubiquitination and actin cytoskeleton dynamics have also been shown to play essential roles in mediating or reg - ulating endocytosis . Ubiquitination of plasma membrane proteins functions as an endocytosis signal for plasma membrane proteins in yeast and is suggested to do so in mammalian cells as well ( Galan et al . , 1994 ; Hicke and Riezman , 1996 ; Roth and Davis , 1996 ; Strous et al . , 1996 ) . Actin is required for endocytosis in yeast ( Kubler and Riezman , 1993 ; Munn et al . , 1995 ) , and the actin monomer sequestering drug latrunculin A depolymerizes actin fila - ments and inhibits receptor - mediated endocytosis in both yeast ( Lappalainen and Drubin , 1997 ) and mammalian cells ( Lamaze et al . , 1997 ) . Studies on nerve terminals have implicated several inter - acting proteins in the endocytosis of synaptic vesicle mem - branes . Some of these include ( a ) the GTPase dynamin , which promotes fission of endocytic vesicles ( Vallee et al . , 1993 ) , ( b ) amphiphysin , which has an SH3 domain that binds to the proline - rich tail of dynamin ( Lichte et al . , 1992 ; David et al . , 1996 ) , and ( c ) synaptojanin , a phosphatidyli - nositol polyphosphate - 5 - phosphatase that , like dynamin , also binds to the SH3 domain in amphiphysin via a proline - rich region ( McPherson et al . , 1996 ; de Heuvel et al . , 1997 ) . Whereas yeast as yet do not appear to have a dynamin - like protein that serves an analogous role in endocytosis , yeast do contain amphiphysin ( Bauer et al . , 1993 ; Sivadon et al . , 1995 ) and synaptojanin homologues ( Luo and Chang , 1997 ; Srinivasan et al . , 1997 ) . The yeast amphiphysin homologues Rvs161p / End6p and Rvs167p are required for the internal - ization step of endocytosis in yeast ( Munn et al . , 1995 ) . There are three synaptojanin homologues in yeast , SJL1 , SJL2 , and SJL3 ( Srinivasan et al . , 1997 ) . Deletion of all three is lethal ; however , double mutants are viable but , con - sistent with a role for SJL gene products in endocytosis , do exhibit marked defects in plasma membrane structure and actin cytoskeleton organization ( Srinivasan et al . , 1997 ) . Pan1p is another protein required for endocytosis and actin cytoskeleton organization in yeast ( Tang and Cai , 1996 ; Wendland et al . , 1996 ; Tang et al . , 1997 ; Zoladek et al . , 1997 ) . Pan1p is a yeast homologue of eps15 , and both pro - teins contain three distinct protein – protein interaction do - mains : ( a ) amino - terminal eps15 homology ( EH ) domains ( Wong et al . , 1995 ) , ( b ) central coiled - coil domains , and ( c ) carboxy - terminal proline - rich regions . eps15 , which contains three EH domains , has been implicated in en - docytosis in mammalian cells due to its physical associa - tion with clathrin and the plasma membrane adaptor com - plex AP - 2 ( Benmerah et al . , 1996 ; van Delft et al . , 1997 b ) . Pan1p contains two EH domains and interacts with an - other EH domain – containing protein , End3p ( Tang et al . , 1997 ) , that is also required for endocytosis ( Raths et al . , 1993 ; Benedetti et al . , 1994 ) . Thus , EH domains are postu - lated to play a role in protein – protein interactions re - quired for endocytosis . Finally , clathrin assembly and adaptor proteins are re - quired for clathrin - dependent membrane trafficking steps . Indeed , the heterotetrameric adaptor complex AP - 2 is re - quired for clathrin - dependent endocytosis in mammalian cells ( Lin et al . , 1991 ; Smythe et al . , 1992 ) . Interestingly , a distinct , nonheterotetrameric clathrin assembly protein called AP180 also binds to clathrin and promotes its as - sembly into cages ( Ahle and Ungewickell , 1986 ; Keen and Black , 1986 ; Prasad and Lippoldt , 1988 ) . AP180 has also been called AP - 3 , F1 - 20 , pp155 , and NP185 ( Murphy et al . , 1991 ; Zhou et al . , 1993 ) , and it is a neuronal - specific ( Kohtz and Puszkin , 1988 ; Sousa et al . , 1992 ) synaptic ( Perry et al . , 1991 , 1992 ; Sousa et al . , 1992 ) phosphopro - tein ( Keen and Black , 1986 ; Morris et al . , 1990 ; Zhou et al . , 1992 ) that localizes to clathrin - coated pits in synaptic nerve terminals ( Takei et al . , 1996 ) . Until recently , AP180 was thought to serve a neuronal - specific function , perhaps in the endocytic recycling of synaptic vesicles ( Zhou et al . , 1993 ) . Whereas there may be a neuron - specific role for AP180 , the existence of yeast homologues , as well as a re - lated and ubiquitously expressed human protein called clathrin assembly lymphoid myeloid leukemia gene ( CALM ; Dreyling et al . , 1996 ) , suggests that these pro - teins may also participate more widely in membrane traf - ficking events in other cell types . In this study , we have identified two new members of the AP180 family , the homologous yeast proteins yAP180A and yAP180B . We show that these proteins bind to clathrin and to Pan1p to form a complex that is lo - calized to punctate spots at the cell periphery . A genetic interaction between PAN1 and the SJL1 gene was also un - covered . Based on these and other observations , we pro - pose that Pan1p coordinates the interactions of several structural and regulatory proteins required for endocytosis in yeast . Materials and Methods Strains , Media , and Materials The strains used in these studies are listed in Table I . Yeast strains were grown in standard yeast extract - peptone - dextrose ( YPD ) or synthetic me - dium with dextrose supplemented with the appropriate amino acids as re - quired for plasmid maintenance . Bacterial strains were grown on standard media supplemented with 100 (cid:109) g / ml ampicillin or 30 (cid:109) g / ml kanamycin , as appropriate , to maintain plasmids . Materials were purchased from Fisher Scientific Co . ( Fairlawn , NJ ) or Sigma Chemical Co . ( St . Louis , MO ) un - less otherwise stated . Databases and Internet Sources Searches and comparisons were conducted using the Saccharomyces Ge - nome database ( http : / / genome - www . stanford . edu / Saccharomyces / ) , the Yeast Proteome database ( http : / / www . proteome . com / YPDhome . html ) , the XRef database ( http : / / www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov / XREFdb / ) , and ProSite ( http : / / expasy . hcuge . ch / sprot / prosite . html ) . Plasmid Construction Standard recombinant DNA techniques were performed as previously de - scribed ( Maniatas et al . , 1982 ) with reagents obtained from Boehringer Mannheim Corp . ( Indianapolis , IN ) or New England Biolabs Inc . ( Bev - erly , MA ) . The plasmids used in these studies are described in Table I . The YAP1801 and YAP1802 genes were obtained by PCR amplifica - tion of chromosomal DNA to produce pYAP180A and pYAP180B , re - spectively . The yap1801 : : HIS3 deletion construct removes 84 % of the Wendland and Emr An Endocytic Regulatory Complex 73 open reading frame ( ORF ) , corresponding to deletion from 39 nucleotides upstream of the start ATG to amino acid 537 . This plasmid was linearized with XhoI and ScaI to allow homologous recombination and gene replace - ment . The yap1802 : : LEU2 deletion construct results in deletion of amino acids 25 – 516 , or 86 % of the YAP1802 ORF . To delete the YAP1802 locus , this LEU2 deletion construct was linearized with SnaBI . The deletion strains were generated by sequential deletion of YAP1801 and YAP1802 in an SEY6210a / (cid:97) diploid , followed by sporulation and dissection . GFP – yAP180 fusion constructs were made using oligonucleotides and PCR to introduce an in - frame SalI site upstream of the start ATG . Yeast Two - Hybrid Assays The strain HF7c was first transformed with pPAN1 . 1 followed by trans - formation with a yeast cDNA library constructed in the GAL4 activator Table I .

N . J . Seaman , unpublished The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 141 , 1998 74 domain plasmid pGADGH ( LEU2 ) . Colonies that arose on Trp (cid:50) / Leu (cid:50) / His (cid:50) selective plates were replica plated and one set transferred to filter disks , ( Whatman Inc . , Clifton , NJ ) lysed by freezing in liquid N 2 , and incu - bated at 30 (cid:56) C with 0 . 1 M NaPO 4 , 10 mM KCl , 1 mM MgSO 4 , 0 . 27 % (cid:98) - mercaptoethanol , 0 . 33 mg / ml XGal , pH 7 . 0 . Blue colonies were se - lected , retested , and LEU2 plasmids isolated and sequenced as previously described ( Wendland et al . , 1996 ) . Quantitative (cid:98) - gal assays were per - formed by transforming the strain SFY526 with the appropriate plasmids , selecting three colonies from each transformation , and performing the as - say in triplicate for each colony as described in the Clonetech Match - maker II manual ( Stonybrook , NY ) . GST Fusion Protein / Yeast Extract – binding Experiments Lysates from bacteria expressing GST fusion proteins were produced and incubated with glutathione – agarose beads to purify the GST fusion pro - teins . For this , glutathione – agarose beads were equilibrated with PBS , in - cubated with lysate for 30 min at 4 (cid:56) C , washed five times with PBS , and re - suspended with a volume of PBS to yield (cid:122) 50 % beads / vol . 20 (cid:109) l of beads containing a total of 5 – 10 (cid:109) g fusion protein were used for each binding ex - periment . Yeast extracts were generated by growing TVY614 , PSY15C , and BWY237 in YPD to OD 600 2 – 8 . P16 membranes ( for Pan1p binding ) or P100 membranes ( for clathrin binding ) were isolated as described ( Mueller and Branton , 1984 ) . The pellets were extracted with 1 % TX - 100 in 100 mM MES , 0 . 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 2 mM DTT , 0 . 1 mM AEBSF ( Calbi - ochem - Novabiochem Corp . , La Jolla , CA ) , 0 . 02 % NaN 3 , pH 6 . 5 at 4 (cid:56) C for 1 – 3 h , followed by centrifugation at 15 , 000 g for 5 min at 4 (cid:56) C . The protein concentration of the resulting extracts ranged from 1 – 3 mg / ml . Approxi - mately 150 (cid:109) g of extract was incubated with 20 (cid:109) l 50 % GST fusion protein – bound beads at 4 (cid:56) C for 1 h , followed by washing three to five times with 1 ml PBS (cid:49) 0 . 1 mM AEBSF . Liquid was removed from the beads , 40 (cid:109) l protein sample buffer added , and 5 – 10 (cid:109) l loaded per lane on SDS - PAGE minigels . The gels were then stained with either silver or Coomassie blue , or transferred to nitrocellulose for immunoblotting with affinity - purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies , recognizing Pan1p ( Nos . 91 or 92 ; provided by Sachs , A . , University of California , Berkeley , CA ; Boeck et al . , 1996 ) , or yeast clathrin light chain ( a gift from Payne , G . , UCLA , Los Angeles , CA ) , or a mouse monoclonal recognizing yeast clathrin heavy chain ( SKL1 ; Lemmon et al . , 1988 ) . Coimmunoprecipitation Experiments Appropriate yeast strains were grown in YPD to midlog and 20 OD 600 were harvested . The cells were spheroplasted as previously described ( Rieder et al . , 1996 ) , and homogenized at 5 OD / ml in a Kontes glass dounce ( Kimble / Kontes Glass , Vineland , NJ ) with 10 up - and - down strokes in 1 % Triton X - 100 , 0 . 2 M sorbitol , 50 mM KOAc , 20 mM Hepes , 2 mM EDTA , pH 6 . 8 . The homogenate was extracted on ice for 15 min , and then centrifuged at 13 , 000 g for 5 min . Equal aliquots of 5 OD equiva - lents of lysate were distributed to eppendorf tubes and either no antibod - ies or 4 (cid:109) l of rabbit polyclonal (cid:97) - Pan1p was added and incubated at 4 (cid:56) C for 2 h with agitation . 100 (cid:109) l protein A – Sepharose beads were next added and incubated for an additional hour , followed by washing twice with 1 ml PBS . The last traces of liquid were removed with a Hamilton sy - ringe , and the bound proteins eluted with SDS - PAGE protein sample buffer . An 8 % acrylamide gel was run with 2 OD equivalents loaded , with 0 . 1 OD equivalent of total lysate loaded for comparison . After transfer to nitrocellulose , the paper was incubated with Ponceau S to stain the rabbit IgG heavy and light chains , and this portion of the blot was excised . The re - mainder of the blot was processed for labeling with the yAP180 antiserum and developed using ECL reagents . Immunoprecipitation of Pan1p was confirmed by immunoblotting . Subcellular Fractionation Appropriate yeast strains were grown in YPD to midlog and 20 OD 600 harvested . The cells were spheroplasted as previously described ( Rieder et al . , 1996 ) , and homogenized in a Kontes glass dounce with 10 up - and - down strokes . Sequential differential centrifugation at 300 , 13 , 000 , and 100 , 000 g generated P13 , P100 , and S100 fractions that were then resolved by SDS - PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose for immunoblotting . Generation of Antibodies To produce a polyclonal antiserum that recognizes the yAP180 proteins , rabbits were immunized with the GST – yAP180A fusion protein encoding amino acids 24 – 637 ( Scantibodies Inc . , Ramona , CA ) . An affinity column was prepared by covalently cross - linking the antigen to cyanogen bromide – activated beads for affinity purification of anti - yAP180 immunoglobulins . The peak fractions were pooled and diluted 1 : 500 for immunoblots . GFP Fusion Protein Microscopy Yeast cells expressing GFP fusion proteins were grown in selective me - dium to midlog phase and examined using a Delta Vision deconvoluting light microscope on a Silicon Graphics workstation . Optical sections were collected at 200 – 300 nm steps in the z - axis . Extracts from GFP fusion pro - tein – expressing cells also were examined by immunoblotting with an af - finity - purified antiserum directed against GFP ( a gift provided by Zuker , C . , and R . Tsien , UCSD , La Jolla , CA ) . pan1 – 20 and Synaptojanin - like Genetic Interactions To test for lethality of pan1 – 20 sjl1 (cid:68) , BWY249 was mated to SEY6210 fol - lowed by sporulation and tetrad dissection . To test for lethality of pan1 – 20 in combination with sjl2 (cid:68) or sjl3 (cid:68) , a diploid strain was produced by mat - ing BWY20 with (cid:68) SJL2 (cid:68) SJL3 , followed by sporulation and dissection . The genotype of the viable spores was determined by replica plating to ap - propriate selective media , and the genotypes of inviable spores deduced from the viable counterparts in the same tetrad . pan1 – 20 sjl2 (cid:68) and pan1 – 20 sjl3 (cid:68) spores were viable , but grew more slowly than wild - type or single mutants . The only pan1 - 20 sjl1 (cid:68) spores recovered also contained the wild - type PAN1 gene on a plasmid ; inviable spores that did not grow beyond eight cell colonies were deduced to have a pan1 – 20 sjl1 (cid:68) genotype , and did not contain the pPAN1 plasmid . The corresponding open reading frame ( ORF ) designations for the yeast synaptojanin - like genes are : SJL1 , YIL002c ; SJL2 , YNL106c ; SJL3 , YOR109w . Results Yeast Two - Hybrid Screen with Pan1p EH Domains Identifies yAP180A Pan1p , a protein required for endocytosis in yeast , con - tains two EH domains ( Tang and Cai , 1996 ; Wendland et al . , 1996 ) . EH domains are found in several proteins impli - cated in endocytosis , including Pan1p , End3p , and eps15 . To understand the role of EH domains and how these do - mains influence Pan1p function , a two - hybrid screen ( Fields and Song , 1989 ) was used to identify proteins that interact with the EH domains of Pan1p . The bait was com - prised of the GAL4 DNA – binding domain fused to amino acids 96 – 713 of Pan1p , which includes both EH domains ( Fig . 1 A ) , and was screened against a yeast cDNA library fused to the prey plasmid encoding the GAL4 - activator domain . 250 , 000 colonies were tested for positive interac - tions by selecting for His (cid:49) , followed by examining the ex - pression of (cid:98) - galactosidase using a standard blue / white screen ( see Materials and Methods ) . Of 50 blue colonies selected , only two turned blue very rapidly ( blue color de - veloped in 15 min ) , indicating a high level of (cid:98) - galactosi - dase expression . The other 48 colonies were a much weaker blue ( blue color developed in (cid:62) 2 h ) , and retesting allowed for selection of the 12 strongest blue colonies for further analysis . These colonies were isolated , and the prey plasmids recovered and sequenced . The plasmids from the very blue colonies encoded in - frame fusions be - tween the GAL4 activator domain and the carboxy termi - nus of the yeast ORF YHR161c : one fusion began at amino acid 432 , whereas the other began at residue 439 . Wendland and Emr An Endocytic Regulatory Complex 75 Database searches with the predicted protein sequence of YHR161c revealed significant homology to four other proteins . The most similar protein was another yeast ORF designated YGR241c , which is predicted to encode a pro - tein 43 % identical to YHR161c . The other homologous proteins were the mammalian neuronal - specific protein AP180 ( Murphy et al . , 1991 ; Zhou et al . , 1992 , 1993 ) , a ubiquitously expressed human protein termed CALM ( Dreyling et al . , 1996 ) , and C32E8 . 10 , a Caenorhabditis el - egans gene ( Wilson et al . , 1994 ) . The primary region of ho - mology between the yeast , mammalian , and C . elegans proteins resides in the amino - terminal 300 residues ( Fig . 1 B ) . Because of the significant similarity between the yeast proteins and the previously described mammalian pro - teins , the yeast proteins corresponding to YHR161c and YGR241c have been designated yAP180A and yAP180B , and the genes have been named YAP1801 and YAP1802 , respectively . Of the 12 weaker blue prey plasmids se - quenced , three corresponded to fusions within the unchar - acterized ORFs YOL101c ( beginning at amino acid 254 ) , YDL161w ( beginning at amino acid 248 ) , and YOR105w ( beginning at amino acid 14 ) , whereas the other nine en - coded either out - of - frame fusions or fusions with untrans - lated regions of chromosomal DNA . Bait plasmids expressing truncated versions of Pan1p were constructed to define further the region of Pan1p that interacts with yAP180A . Prey plasmids corresponding to nearly full - length yAP180A and to the carboxy termi - nus of yAP180B were also generated . Pairwise combina - tions of bait and prey plasmids were introduced into the strain SFY526 , that was used for quantitative (cid:98) - galactosi - dase assays on cells expressing the various pairs of fusion proteins . The results of these experiments are shown in Table II . Both Pan1p EH domains , either together or indi - vidually , were found to interact to varying degrees with the yAP180 proteins . In control experiments , empty bait plasmid encoding the GAL4 DNA - binding domain alone , when combined with the prey plasmids , did not induce high levels of expression of the (cid:98) - galactosidase enzyme . Amino Acid Sequence Features of yAP180 Proteins yAP180A and yAP180B display 43 % identity over their entire lengths , including a glutamine - rich ( Q ) carboxy - ter - minal region . Both are hydrophilic proteins with no amino - terminal signal sequence and are therefore pre - dicted to reside in the cytoplasm . The yAP180 proteins contain a motif ( residues 15 – 35 in yAP180A ) similar to one implicated in the binding of phosphatidylinositol 3 , 4 , 5 trisphosphate ( PI [ 3 , 4 , 5 ] P 3 ) that is also shared with mam - malian AP180 , centaurin (cid:97) , and synaptotagmin ( Ham - Figure 1 .

The sequence of this motif in centaurin (cid:97) is P ( X 13 - 14 ) R / K ( X 4 ) R / K ( X ) K ( X 5 ) F ( X 6 ) E . In all AP180 proteins the P ( X 13 - 14 ) is absent , whereas in both yAP180 proteins , the F is replaced by L , and in yAP180B , the E is replaced by R . Detailed mapping of the inositol polyphosphate ( IP ) - and polyphosphoi - nositide ( PI ) - binding sites within mAP180 has not yet been performed ; however , mAP180 contains this motif within the region of the protein that binds to IP ( Norris et al . , 1995 ; Ye et al . , 1995 ) and to PI ( Hao et al . , 1997 ) . It is cur - rently unknown whether the yAP180 proteins bind to IP or PI . Another domain found in the yAP180 proteins is a puta - tive leucine zipper that begins at residue 194 ( yAP180A ) or at residue 188 ( yAP180B ) , in a region particularly well con - served between the yAP180 proteins and their mammalian / C . elegans homologues ( underlined in Fig . 1 B ) . All of these motifs are candidates for mediating regulation of the yAP180 proteins and their interactions with other proteins . yAP180 Proteins Bind to Pan1p and Clathrin To confirm the interactions between Pan1p and yAP180A and to investigate further the possible functional role of distinct domains of yAP180 proteins , glutathione - S - trans - ferase ( GST ) fusion proteins ( Smith and Johnson , 1988 ) corresponding to various domains of the yAP180A protein were constructed ( Fig . 2 A ) . The expression and stability of the fusion proteins were confirmed by isolation of GST fusion proteins on glutathione – agarose beads and analysis by SDS - PAGE . The GST – yAP180A fusion proteins were tested for interactions with Pan1p from yeast extracts be - cause expression of any part of the Pan1 protein was toxic to bacteria ( Sachs and Deardorff , 1992 ; our unpublished observations ) . Approximately equal amounts of the GST fusion proteins ( 5 – 10 (cid:109) g ) were immobilized to gluta - thione – agarose beads and incubated with 150 (cid:109) g of pro - tein derived from wild - type yeast extracts . After binding and washing , the bound proteins from the extract were separated by SDS - PAGE , and analyzed by immunoblot - ting with a Pan1p - specific antiserum ( Fig . 2 B ) . Consistent with the interaction observed by two - hybrid analysis , Pan1p bound to the carboxy - terminal yAP180A C1 frag - ment but not to the amino - terminal N1 fragment . When the C1 fragment was further subdivided into the C2 and C3 fragments , Pan1p - binding activity was contained within the C2 region of yAP180A . Analysis of this C2 region that interacted with Pan1p EH domains revealed a tripeptide se - quence asparagine - proline - phenylalanine ( NPF ) that was repeated five times in both yAP180 proteins ( denoted by (cid:100) in Fig . 2 A ; see Discussion ) . A GST fusion protein cor - responding to the carboxy - terminal half of yAP180B was also capable of binding to Pan1p from yeast extracts ( data not shown ) . GST alone showed no binding to Pan1p . The mammalian AP180 protein has been shown to bind to clathrin in vitro ( Murphy et al . , 1991 ; Morris et al . , 1993 ; Ye and Lafer , 1995 ) . When the C1 , C3 , or C5 GST fusion proteins were incubated with yeast extracts and washed , the bound fraction contained one major band of (cid:122) 170 kD that was detected by silver staining ( Fig . 2 C ) . This band migrated more rapidly than Pan1p , and its size was consis - tent with the mobility of yeast clathrin . Therefore , the ability of the yAP180A fusion proteins to interact with yeast clathrin was also examined . The experiments were performed as above , and the clathrin interaction was de - tected using antibodies recognizing the clathrin heavy or light chains . Results obtained using a monoclonal antibody that specifically recognizes the clathrin heavy chain ( Chc1p ) or a polyclonal antiserum directed against the clathrin light chain ( Clc1p ) are shown in Fig . 2 D . As observed for the Pan1p interaction , yeast clathrin bound to the C1 yAP180A fusion protein . However , the clathrin - binding activity resides in a domain of yAP180A distinct from the domain that binds to Pan1p . The region of yAP180A that Figure 2 . GST – yAP180A fusion protein binding to Pan1p and clathrin in vitro . ( A ) Schematic of the yAP180A protein with fragments used for GST fusion proteins shown below . (cid:100) , indi - cates the location of the tripeptide “NPF , ” hatched region delineates the Pan1p - binding domain , cross - hatched region shows the clath - rin - binding domain , and Q 17 indicates 17 consecutive glutamine residues . ( B ) Extracts from wild - type yeast cells were incubated with immobilized GST fusion proteins , washed , and bound pro - teins resolved by SDS - PAGE followed by immunoblotting with a Pan1p - specific antiserum . ( C ) Bound proteins visualized by silver staining a 7 . 5 % acrylamide gel . ( D ) A similar experiment as in B , but using a monoclonal antibody specific for yeast clathrin heavy chain and a polyclonal antibody specific for yeast clathrin light chain . Wendland and Emr An Endocytic Regulatory Complex 77 interacts with clathrin was further defined to lie within the C5 fusion protein , which encodes the extreme carboxy - termi - nal 50 residues of yAP180A , and not within the glutamine - rich ( Q 17 ) region directly preceding the C5 segment . When the unbound fractions were examined by immunoblotting for Chc1p , all of the Chc1p had been depleted by the C1 and C3 fusions and 50 % depleted by the C5 fusion protein ( data not shown ) . Yeast clathrin also interacted with the carboxy - terminal half of yAP180B ( data not shown ) . When compared to the database and to the domains of other proteins known to bind clathrin , no previously iden - tified clathrin - binding motifs were found within this se - quence . The yAP180 proteins thus appear to have a three domain structure : ( a ) an amino - terminal AP180 homology domain , ( b ) a central Pan1p - binding domain with NPF re - peats , and ( c ) a carboxy - terminal clathrin association do - main . Together , these data suggest the existence of a com - plex between Pan1p , yAP180 proteins , and clathrin . Additional independent evidence for in vivo interac - tions between Pan1p and yAP180A was obtained by na - tive coimmunoprecipitation experiments . Wild - type and yap1801 (cid:68) yap1802 (cid:68) cells were spheroplasted , homoge - nized , and solubilized by incubation with 1 % Triton X - 100 . Parallel samples of extracts were prepared to which either no antibodies were added or a rabbit polyclonal antiserum recognizing Pan1p was added followed by the addition of protein A – Sepharose beads . The protein A – Sepharose beads were washed , and the bound proteins eluted and an - alyzed by Western blotting . The portion of the Western blot with the rabbit IgG heavy and light chains was excised ( omitting proteins that migrate faster than (cid:122) 55 kD ) , and the remainder of the blot probed with the polyclonal anti - serum recognizing yAP180 proteins ( the specificity of anti - serum is demonstrated below ) . For comparison , separate , parallel samples of the extracts that were used for the coimmunoprecipitations were run on the same gels to de - termine the total amount of yAP180 protein in the starting material . A distinct band which comigrated with yAP180A was clearly apparent in the lane where wild - type extracts were used . Comparison with the total starting amount of yAP180A indicated that (cid:122) 3 – 5 % of the yAP180A protein from wild - type cells could be coimmunoprecipitated with Pan1p ( Fig . 3 ) . This band was absent from coimmunopre - cipitations performed on extracts of cells lacking the yAP180A and yAP180B proteins and from extracts lacking added antibodies . Furthermore , an increased signal was ob - served using extracts from cells overproducing yAP180A ( data not shown ) . The background smear in the lanes where antibody was added is due to cross - reactivity of the rabbit (cid:97) - Pan1p IgGs with the secondary antibody used to develop the Western blot . Although only a small percentage of yAP180A was complexed with Pan1p by native coimmuno - precipitation , these data nevertheless support a specific physical interaction between Pan1p and yAP180A . To - gether , these three independent experimental techniques ( two - hybrid , GST binding , and native coimmunoprecipita - tion ) all reveal interactions between Pan1p and yAP180A . Phenotypes of YAP1801 and YAP1802 Deletion Mutants To investigate the function of the genes encoding the yAP180 proteins , YAP1801 and YAP1802 were deleted either individually or together . Strains that lack both yAP180 proteins were viable and grew under all condi - tions tested , including high temperature ( 38 (cid:56) C ) and 3 % glycerol ( data not shown ) . Under the conditions tested thus far , the mutant strains have revealed no major defects in secretion , endocytosis , or structure of the actin cytoskel - eton . When the YAP180 genes were deleted in combina - tion with the pan1 – 20 mutation , no synthetic growth de - fects were observed . Only slightly slower growth was observed in strains with the YAP180 genes deleted in com - bination with a chc ts mutation . A lack of major synthetic growth defects using these alleles of PAN1 and CHC1 does not , of course , rule out genetic interactions between these genes ( e . g . , Zoladek et al . , 1997 ) . Together , these data indicate that YAP180 genes are nonessential and that the proteins may have a regulatory function and / or that there is an additional protein with redundant functions ( e . g . , the ORF YJR125c , which also displays a low degree of homology to the amino terminus of AP180 proteins ; Fig . 4 D ) . Although the precise function ( s ) of the yAP180 proteins may not mirror the roles of the AP - 1 and AP - 2 adaptor complexes , deletions in yeast of genes encoding either the yAP180A or yAP180B proteins or subunits of the AP - 1 and AP - 2 adaptor complexes are all notable for their absence of phenotypes . yAP180 Protein Characterization by Subcellular Fractionation A polyclonal rabbit antiserum was generated against a GST fusion protein corresponding to amino acids 24 – 637 Figure 3 . Native coimmunoprecipitation of yA180A with Pan1p . 1 % Triton X - 100 extracts of wild - type or yap1801 (cid:68) yap1802 (cid:68) cells were generated and no antibodies ( (cid:50) ) or Pan1p antiserum ( (cid:49) ) were added . Native immune complexes were isolated , sepa - rated on SDS - PAGE , and analyzed by immunoblotting for yAP180 proteins . For comparison , 5 % of total extract was loaded ( right ) . Figure 4 .

The fractions were resolved by SDS - PAGE , and yAP180 proteins were detected by immuno - blotting with affinity - purified antibodies that recognize both yAP180A and yAP180B proteins . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 141 , 1998 78 of yAP180A . The specificity of this antiserum , its cross - reactivity with the homologous yAP180B protein , and sub - cellular fractionation of the yAP180 proteins ( described in further detail below ) are shown in Fig . 4 . Yeast sphero - plasts were homogenized to generate a lysate that was sub - jected to differential centrifugation to produce low speed 13 , 000 g pellet ( P13 ) and supernatant ( S13 ) fractions . The S13 was then spun at 100 , 000 g to generate high speed pel - let ( P100 ) and supernatant ( S100 ) fractions . Differential centrifugation was performed on extracts from wild - type , yap1801 (cid:68) , yap1802 (cid:68) , and yap1801 (cid:68) yap1802 (cid:68) strains , fol - lowed by analysis of the fractions by immunoblotting ( Fig . 4 ) . Similar results were obtained using metabolically la - beled cells followed by fractionation , immunoprecipita - tion , and fluorography ( data not shown ) . A strain in which both YAP180 genes were deleted re - vealed one low abundance cross - reactive band in the high speed pellet ( Fig . 4 D ) . The identity of this antigenically related protein is currently unknown but may in part ex - plain the absence of major phenotypes in the double dele - tion strain ( see above ) . The yAP180A and yAP180B pro - tein bands in the wild - type cell fractionation could be clearly identified by comparing the wild - type fractions to those of yap1801 (cid:68) and yap1802 (cid:68) cells . The top two 90 - and 82 - kD bands correspond to yAP180A , as this signal is also observed in yap1802 (cid:68) cells ( Fig . 4 C ) . Furthermore , this signal is intensified (cid:122) 10 – 20 fold in a strain overex - pressing the yAP180A protein ( data not shown ) . The pre - dicted molecular mass for yAP180A is 72 kD ; therefore , it is possible that the protein is subject to posttranslational modification ( s ) such as phosphorylation and / or ubiquiti - nation . Alternatively , the aberrant migration of yAP180A may be due to primary sequence and / or secondary struc - ture as observed for mAP180 , which is predicted to be 91 kD yet migrates at 180 kD ( Murphy et al . , 1991 ) . Pulse / chase analysis indicated that the 82 - and 90 - kD yAP180A proteins are stable and showed no indication of a precursor / product relationship , suggesting that the multiple bands are not due to proteolysis of yAP180A protein ( data not shown ) . The lower pair of 67 - kD bands represent yAP180B , as this signal is also observed in yap1801 (cid:68) cells ( Fig . 4 B ) , and a strain overexpressing yAP180B yields an (cid:122) 10 – 20 fold increase in this signal ( data not shown ) . These bands correlate well with the predicted molecular mass of 64 kD for yAP180B , but the doublet of bands observed for yAP180B suggest that this protein also may be subject to posttranslational modification ( s ) . The yAP180 proteins associated primarily with the P13 fraction ( Fig . 4 ) ; this fraction is enriched in the plasma membrane marker protein PM - ATPase ( data not shown ) . This fraction is also enriched in ER , vacuolar , and mito - chondrial membranes ( Marcusson et al . , 1994 ) ; however , given the putative role ( s ) of yAP180 proteins and localiza - tion of GFP – yAP180 fusion proteins ( see below ) , their lo - calization to these compartments seems unlikely . The ma - jority of Pan1p was also found in the P13 fraction ( Tang and Cai , 1996 , our observations ) . Both Pan1p and the yAP180 proteins associated with the P13 fraction were ob - served to float when loaded at the bottom of a sucrose gra - dient ( data not shown ) , consistent with P13 membrane as - sociation . Interestingly , a small amount of yAP180A was also found in the P100 fraction ( Fig . 4 ) . Specifically , the 82 - kD form of yAP180A was approximately equally dis - tributed between the P13 and P100 fractions , whereas the 90 - kD form was observed only in the P13 fraction . Typi - cally , 100 , 000 g pellets are enriched in Golgi membranes , transport vesicles , secretory vesicles , and endosomal mem - branes ( Becherer et al . , 1996 ) ; thus , one cannot assign the precise subcellular localization of this pool of yAP180A using this technique . Nevertheless , this is in contrast to yAP180B , which is found almost entirely in the P13 frac - tion and suggests a differential localization of the yAP180 proteins . yAP180 Proteins Localize to Peripheral Punctate Spots To visualize the yAP180 proteins and determine more clearly their subcellular localization , green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) fusion proteins ( Chalfie et al . , 1994 ) were generated and expressed in wild - type and yap1801 (cid:68) yap1802 (cid:68) cells . When examined by fluorescence micros - copy , each GFP fusion protein was observed in bright spots near the cell surface that were observed in various focal planes at the periphery of the cell . This was true for GFP fusion proteins expressed using either single copy ( CEN ) or 2 (cid:109) overexpression plasmids ( GFP – yAP180A , Fig . 5 ; GFP – yAP180B , data not shown ) . Similar results were obtained with either wild - type or yap1801 (cid:68) yap1802 (cid:68) Figure 5 . Localization of GFP – yAP180A fusion protein . yap1801 (cid:68) yap1802 (cid:68) cells expressing GFP – yAP180A from either single copy ( CEN ; top ) or multi - copy ( 2 (cid:109) ; bottom ) vectors were examined using fluorescence and differential interference ( Nomarski ) light microscopy . The images were processed using deconvoluting software ( Delta Vision ) on a Silcon Graphics workstation . Buds and cytokinesis necks containing concentrated spots of signal are indicated by arrows . Bar , 5 (cid:109) m . Wendland and Emr An Endocytic Regulatory Complex 79 cells ; however , brighter signals were seen with the deletion strain ( data not shown ) . Extracts from these cells were ex - amined for expression of the fusion proteins by immuno - blotting with GFP and yAP180 antisera , which confirmed the production of full - length fusion proteins , and also re - vealed a small amount of proteolysis near the fusion junc - tion that resulted in free , soluble GFP ( data not shown ) . These experiments also showed that higher levels of the GFP fusion proteins were produced in the deletion strain , consistent with the brighter fluorescence signal observed . The bright peripheral spots may correspond to actin corti - cal dots because they were concentrated in small buds of budding cells and at the necks of cells undergoing cytoki - nesis ( Fig . 5 , arrows ) ; this is similar to the distribution of actin cortical spots observed as cells progress through the cell cycle ( Kilmartin and Adams , 1984 ) . Attempts to ob - serve both GFP and actin simultaneously have not been possible because the fixation procedure required to visual - ize actin ( phalloidin staining ) interfered with detection of GFP . However , the yAP180 - interacting protein Pan1p has previously been localized to actin cortical spots ( Tang and Cai , 1996 ) , which are proposed to be the site of secretion and endocytosis in yeast ( Mulholland et al . , 1994 ) . These data suggest that a complex of Pan1p and the yAP180 pro - teins is found at or near actin cortical spots where several other proteins that mediate endocytosis are concentrated ( e . g . , Ayscough et al . , 1997 ) . pan1 – 20 Exhibits Synthetic Lethality with a Deletion of the Yeast Synaptojanin Homologue SJL1 A complex of dynamin , amphiphysin , and synaptojanin has been implicated in the endocytosis of synaptic vesicle membranes in nerve terminals ( David et al . , 1996 ; de Heu - vel et al . , 1997 ) . Synaptojanin is a phosphatidylinositol polyphosphate - 5 - phosphatase that hydrolyzes PI ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and may promote down regulation of signal - ing pathways that are stimulated by these important sec - ond messengers ( De Camilli et al . , 1996 ; McPherson et al . , 1996 ) . PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels affect many important cellular sys - tems . Among these is the actin cytoskeleton , as several ac - tin regulatory proteins are modulated by PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding ( Janmey et al . , 1987 ; Yonezawa et al . , 1990 ) . Pan1p con - tains a consensus sequence for binding to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( Tang and Cai , 1996 ) . It also regulates the structure of the actin cytoskeleton ( Tang and Cai , 1996 ; Wendland et al . , 1996 ) and is localized to actin cortical spots ( Tang and Cai , 1996 ) . Consistent with these observations , yeast strains , in which two of the three synaptojanin - like genes were de - leted ( sjl1 (cid:68) sjl2 (cid:68) ) , exhibited defects in actin cytoskeleton organization and exaggerated membrane invaginations ( Srinivasan et al . , 1997 ) similar to those observed in pan1 mutants ( Wendland et al . , 1996 ) . To investigate potential genetic interactions between PAN1 and the three yeast synaptojanin - like genes SJL1 , SJL2 , and SJL3 / SOP2 ( Luo and Chang , 1997 ; Srinivasan et al . , 1997 ) , a heterozygous diploid strain was generated by mating a pan1 – 20 strain with an sjl2 (cid:68) sjl3 (cid:68) strain . This was followed by sporulation and tetrad dissection . Haploid spores that were deduced to have the double mutant phe - notypes pan1 – 20 sjl2 (cid:68) or pan1 – 20 sjl3 (cid:68) exhibited only mi - nor synthetic growth defects . The SJL1 gene is adjacent to the PAN1 gene on chromosome IX . To produce a double mutant for this pair of genes , a pan1 – 20 haploid strain har - boring a plasmid encoding the wild - type PAN1 gene was used for targeted disruption of the SJL1 gene . After dis - ruption of the SJL1 locus was confirmed by PCR , two in - dependent strains were mated with a wild - type strain , sporulated , and tetrads were dissected . pan1 – 20 sjl1 (cid:68) spores germinated but were unable to grow beyond an eight cell colony unless they also contained the PAN1 plasmid ( Table III ) , indicating that the combination of the pan1 – 20 and sjl1 (cid:68) mutations is synthetically lethal . These genetic interactions suggest that phosphoinositide metab - olites regulate a Pan1p - dependent aspect of endocytosis in yeast . Discussion Pan1p is an essential protein required for normal endocy - tosis in yeast . Its three structural domains—two EH do - mains , a coiled - coil region , and proline - rich motifs—are each likely to participate in distinct protein – protein inter - actions . This multivalent structure implicates Pan1p as a central regulator or adaptor that may transiently recruit and activate multiple components of an endocytic and / or actin cytoskeletal regulatory network , perhaps in an analo - gous manner to the signal transduction adaptor proteins IRS - 1 and GRB2 ( for review see Myers et al . , 1994 ; Carr - away and Carraway , 1995 ) . Here , using the EH domains of Pan1p in a yeast two - hybrid screen , we demonstrate interactions with two new members of the AP180 clathrin assembly protein family , yAP180A and yAP180B . The EH domain interaction site was mapped to a domain in the yAP180 proteins that con - tains a repeated tripeptide sequence , NPF , that is likely to contribute to the specificity of the EH – yAP180 interaction . yAP180A also interacts with clathrin via its 50 carboxy - ter - minal residues , a region distinct from the NPF - containing domain that binds to Pan1p . Subcellular fractionation studies suggested that the yAP180 proteins localize to the plasma membrane . Consistent with this finding , GFP – yAP180 fusion proteins were observed in punctate spots at the cell periphery . These data , together with previously published data on Pan1p ( Tang and Cai , 1996 ) , suggest that complexes between Pan1p and yAP180 proteins pri - marily localize to sites at or near actin cortical dots at the plasma membrane . A small pool of yAP180A was differen - tially localized to the P100 fraction , whereas the GFP analy - sis suggested similar localizations of the yAP180 proteins . This discrepancy could be due to the yAP180A protein also localizing to small transport vesicles or to pelletable pro - tein complexes that are not visible by fluorescence . Lastly , a genetic interaction between PAN1 and SJL1 , a yeast Table III . pan1 - 20 sjl1 : : HIS3 Synthetic Lethality Wild type pan1 - 20 sjl1 (cid:68) ura3 pPAN1URA3 ura3 pPAN1URA3 Live spores 23 37 — 23 Dead spores — — 37 * — * PAN1 and SJL1 loci are linked ; pan1 - 20 sjl1 : : HIS3 without the pPAN1 plasmid formed microcolonies of one to eight cells . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 141 , 1998 80 homologue of the phosphatidylinositol polyphosphate - 5 - phosphatase synaptojanin , implies a regulatory role for inositol phospholipids in a Pan1p - dependent step of endo - ytosis . Together , these data suggest that Pan1p and yAP180 form a plasma membrane – localized complex , which is im - portant for regulating endocytosis in yeast . The NPF - containing Domain of yAP180 Proteins Interacts with the EH Domains of Pan1p Two - hybrid , GST - binding , and native coimmunoprecipita - tion analyses ( Table II , Figs . 2 and 3 ) demonstrated that Pan1p interacts with yAP180 proteins . These analyses also revealed that this interaction occurs via specific domains , with the NH 2 - terminal EH domains of Pan1p binding to NPF motif – containing domains of the yAP180 proteins . This interaction is consistent with recent data demonstrat - ing EH domain – NPF motif interactions by a random pep - tide phage display screen ( Salcini et al . , 1997 ) . These data suggest a model in which the specificity of pairing between distinct EH domains and NPF motifs is determined by nonconserved residues both surrounding the NPF motifs ( Salcini et al . , 1997 ) and within the EH domains , as only one - third of the residues are highly conserved in EH do - mains ( Wong et al . , 1995 ) . Indeed , varying levels of (cid:98) - galac - tosidase activity were observed in two - hybrid studies using the two alternative EH domains of Pan1p and the NPF - containing regions of both yAP180 proteins . Furthermore , one of the GST – yAP180A fusion proteins that contained a single NPF motif ( N1 fusion , Fig . 2 ) did not bind to Pan1p . This suggests that , in addition to the importance of the NPF motif context , the presence of multiple NPF motifs may enhance binding to EH domains . The in vitro data can also be interpreted to mean that the interaction be - tween Pan1p and yAP180A may be transient , as only a small amount of complex was coimmunoprecipitated un - der the experimental conditions used . Further studies will be necessary to determine if there are specific cofactors or posttranslational modifications that regulate the affinity of association or the stability of this complex . The yeast genome contains five ORFs that are predicted to contain EH domains : Pan1p , End3p , YBL047c ( Pan1 - like ) , YJL083w , and YKR019c ( Wendland et al . , 1996 ) . End3p , Pan1p , and the Pan1 - like protein contain one , two , or three amino - terminal EH domains , respectively , whereas YJL083w and YKR019c are homologous proteins of un - known function with single carboxy - terminal EH domains . End3p also contains two internal repeats at the carboxy terminus which , by two - hybrid analysis , interact with the amino terminus of Pan1p ( Tang et al . , 1997 ) . This interac - tion requires both the second EH domain of Pan1p and the Sla1p homology domain directly preceding the second EH domain ( Sla1p is an actin - binding protein ; Holtzman et al . , 1993 ) . However , this interaction is distinct from the Pan1p – yAP180 interaction because ( a ) End3p does not contain an NPF motif , and ( b ) the yAP180 proteins inter - acted with both the first and second EH domains of Pan1p , and these interactions did not require the Sla1p homology domain ( Table II ) . It is not yet known if the yAP180 pro - teins bind to EH domains in other yeast proteins ; how - ever , because yAP180A interacted with Pan1p from both end3 (cid:68) and pan1 - like (cid:68) extracts ( our unpublished results ) , the End3 and Pan1 - like proteins are not likely to be re - quired for formation of the Pan1p – yAP180 complex . Functional relevance of the NPF motif is also supported by its presence in the cytoplasmic tail domains of Kex2p and Ste3p ( NPFXD ) , where it functions as an endocytosis signal ( Tan et al . , 1996 ) . It is intriguing to speculate that endocytosis of these and other plasma membrane proteins harboring NPF motifs ( e . g . , Axl2p , Cch1p , and Drs2p ) may be mediated by direct interactions with Pan1p or the other EH domain – containing proteins in yeast . Similarities and Differences among AP180 Protein Family Members The mammalian neuronal – specific AP180 protein has been biochemically well characterized . The amino - termi - nal 300 residues , which are conserved in the AP180 family of proteins , bind to IP , PI , and to clathrin triskelions ( Nor - ris et al . , 1995 ; Ye et al . , 1995 ; Hao et al . , 1997 ) . The re - maining carboxy terminus interacts with clathrin triskel - ions and cages , and contains in vitro clathrin cage assembly activity ( Ye and Lafer , 1995 ) . Interestingly , mAP180 clath - rin assembly activity is inhibited in the presence of IP ( Norris et al . , 1995 ; Ye et al . , 1995 ) , consistent with a role for IP or PI as direct regulators of mAP180 activity . The carboxy termini of both mAP180 and the yAP180 proteins bind to clathrin , although the primary sequence is not highly conserved . We are currently testing the yAP180 proteins for in vitro clathrin cage assembly activity . The potential binding and regulatory interactions of the yAP180 proteins with IP and / or PI also remain to be determined . The mammalian AP180 proteins are 896 – 915 amino ac - ids in length and migrate with an aberrantly high molecu - lar mass , which is due to a highly charged central region of the protein ( Murphy et al . , 1991 ) . In contrast , the yAP180 proteins , CALM , and C . elegans AP180 are all smaller proteins of 586 – 684 amino acids which lack the highly charged region . The yeast proteins do not display a large disparity in apparent molecular mass . Another difference is that the amino - terminal domain of neuronal AP180 binds to clathrin , whereas the yAP180A amino - terminal fusion ( N1 ) does not . However , the lack of clathrin - bind - ing activity in the N1 fusion might be explained by the truncation of the first 24 residues . In addition , some poten - tial regulatory interactions may be affected , as the putative IP / PI binding site is also interrupted in the N1 fusion pro - tein . Interestingly , although neuronal AP180 lacks the NPF repeats , the more divergent carboxy termini of the smaller AP180 protein family members ( CALM , yAP180s , C . elegans AP180 ) all contain multiple NPF motifs . Pan1p as a Multivalent Adaptor That Coordinates Both Endocytosis and Organization of the Actin Cytoskeleton The structure of Pan1p suggests that it is a protein with the capacity to interact with multiple proteins through distinct binding domains . The data presented in this paper , to - gether with findings from other labs , have allowed us to propose a model in which Pan1p dynamically coordinates the recruitment and possibly the regulation of several pro - teins required both for endocytosis and for organization of the actin cytoskeleton ( Fig . 6 ) . The proteins that interact Wendland and Emr An Endocytic Regulatory Complex 81 with each of the domains of Pan1p ( EH domains , coiled - coil , and proline - rich motifs ) as well as the implications of these interactions on the control of endocytosis and the ac - tin cytoskeleton are described below . Pan1p EH Domains . The EH domains of Pan1p associ - ate with the NPF - containing domain of the yAP180 pro - teins . Because yAP180A has distinct binding domains for Pan1p and clathrin , yAP180A may serve as a bridging pro - tein that links Pan1p to clathrin and presumably regulates clathrin function and / or cage assembly ( Fig . 6 ) . Although the methods used for these studies cannot definitively rule out indirect interactions between yAP180A , Pan1p , and clathrin , our in vitro interaction and subcellular fraction - ation data suggest that these proteins undergo at least transient interactions as part of a multimeric protein com - plex . One model is that Pan1p / End3p / yAP180 complexes localize to endocytic sites , present EH domains for inter - action with NPF motifs in the tails of plasma membrane proteins destined for endocytosis , and the yAP180 pro - teins recruit and polymerize clathrin triskelions . Given the genetic interactions between PAN1 and SJL1 ( Table III ) , we are currently testing for physical interactions between the carboxy - terminal NPF of Sjl1p and the EH domains of Pan1p . By analogy , the NPF - containing domain of mam - malian synaptojanin recently has been shown to bind to the EH domains of eps15 ( Haffner et al . , 1997 ) . Pan1p Coiled - Coil . The central coiled - coil domain of eps15 mediates the formation of dimers , which in turn form higher molecular weight oligomeric complexes ( Tebar et al . , 1997 ) . Pan1p may similarly dimerize / oligo - merize through coiled - coil interactions either with itself and / or with other coiled - coil containing proteins . Gel fil - tration of yeast cytosol has indicated that soluble Pan1p fractionates in a size range consistent with the formation of a large complex ( our unpublished results ) . Pan1p Proline - rich Domain . The proline - rich domain of Pan1p contains binding motifs for both SH3 and WW do - mains . WW motifs are 33 – amino acid blocks ( Sudol et al . , 1995 ) that bind to the proline - rich sequences PPLP and PPXY ( Chan et al . , 1996 ; Bedford et al . , 1997 ; Linn et al . , 1997 ) . Interestingly , genetic interactions have been identi - fied between Pan1p and the WW domain – containing Rsp5p ( Zoladek et al . , 1997 ; Fig . 6 ) . Rsp5p , a ubiquitin - protein ligase required for endocytosis ( Hein et al . , 1995 ; Galan et al . , 1996 ; Zoladek et al . , 1997 ) , also contains a C2 domain predicted to bind Ca 2 (cid:49) and acidic phospholipids and a carboxy terminal hect ( homologous to the E6 - AP carboxy terminus ) domain , the signature motif of ubiq - uitin - protein ligase E3 enzymes . Whether physical interac - tion between Pan1p and Rsp5p occurs via one or more of the three WW motifs in Rsp5p binding to the three pro - line - rich WW – binding consensus sequences present at the carboxy terminus of Pan1p is currently being investigated . Rsp5p also contains one NPF motif that could bind to Pan1p via the EH domains . Pan1p may act as a connector , bringing Rsp5p close to potential ubiquitination substrates like the tail domains of certain plasma membrane proteins destined for endocytosis . Ubiquitination is required for the endocytosis of several plasma membrane proteins both in yeast and mammalian cells . These plasma membrane proteins are subject to ubiquitination , and endocytosis of these proteins does not occur when ubiquitination is blocked ( Kolling and Hollenberg , 1994 ; Hicke and Riez - man , 1996 ; Roth and Davis , 1996 ; Strous et al . , 1996 ) . Al - ternatively , Pan1p may itself be ubiquitinated by Rsp5p , as the Pan1p homologue eps15 is ubiquitinated in mamma - lian cells ( van Delft et al . , 1997 a ) . SH3 domains are (cid:122) 60 residues in size and bind to pro - line - rich consensus sequences ( Ren et al . , 1993 ; Yu et al . , 1994 ) that are distinct from those that interact with WW domains . Recent evidence suggests that some proteins contain overlapping SH3 - and WW - binding motifs that compete for binding partners ( Sudol , 1996 ; Bedford et al . , 1997 ) . The proline - rich domain of Pan1p contains both ad - jacent and overlapping SH3 - and WW - binding motifs . SH3 - domain – containing proteins that are good candidates for binding to Pan1p include the yeast amphiphysin homo - logue Rvs167p and the type I myosins Myo3p and Myo5p that are required for endocytosis ( Bauer et al . , 1993 ; Geli and Riezman , 1996 ) and the actin - binding proteins Sla1p and Abp1p ( Holtzman et al . , 1993 ) . Like Rsp5p , Sla1p also contains a single NPF motif . Additional studies will be re - quired to determine which , if any , of these proteins binds to Pan1p . Endocytosis and the Actin Cytoskeleton . As our under - standing of endocytosis increases , unanticipated parallels in the molecular mechanisms of endocytosis in yeast and mammalian cells are being uncovered . Studies of endocy - tosis in S . cerevisiae have long pointed to a central role for the actin cytoskeleton in this ubiquitous and essential pro - cess ( Kubler and Riezman , 1993 ) . The structure of the yeast actin cytoskeleton may be indirectly affected by in - teractions between Sjl1p and Pan1p , as suggested by the genetic interactions presented here . Consistent with this , synaptojanin activity modulates the levels of phosphoi - Figure 6 . A model describing the interactions between Pan1p and proteins that regulate clathrin ( yAP180A / B ) , the actin cy - toskeleton ( End3p ) , the ubiquitination pathway ( Rsp5p ) , and inositol phospholipids ( the synaptojanin - like inositol - 5 - phos - phatases ) . Solid arrows indicate physical interactions between the proteins , and the dashed arrows denote genetic interactions . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 141 , 1998 82 nositides to influence the structure of the actin cytoskele - ton ( Sakisaka et al . , 1997 ) . Recently , an important role for actin cytoskeleton dynamics in endocytosis has been rec - ognized in mammalian cells ( Lamaze et al . , 1997 ) . Local depolymerization of actin may be necessary to allow for assembly of clathrin and / or other coat proteins that medi - ate the formation of endocytic vesicles . Using the actin de - polymerizing agent latrunculin A , it was found that en - docytosis in both yeast and mammalian cells requires the turnover of actin filaments ( Lamaze et al . , 1997 ; Lappa - lainen and Drubin , 1997 ) . Interestingly , end3 and sla1 mu - tants , each of which are synthetically lethal in combination with pan1 alleles , are resistant to latrunculin A ( Ayscough et al . , 1997 ) . This suggests that End3p and Sla1p normally destabilize actin filaments ; in their absence , the stabilized actin filaments require more latrunculin A for depolymer - ization ( Ayscough et al . , 1997 ) . It is likely that Pan1p may also regulate actin filament turnover , as elongated and thickened actin structures extending from the plasma membrane appear in pan1 mutants at nonpermissive tem - perature ( Wendland et al . , 1996 ) . Whether Pan1p regula - tion of the actin cytoskeleton is through its interactions with End3p , synaptojanin , or other as yet unrecognized in - teractions remains to be determined . Based on our data combined with findings from others , we propose that Pan1p participates in a dynamic series of protein interactions ( Fig . 6 ) which serve both to regulate and coordinate the activity of the endocytic and actin cy - toskeletal machinery . Activities included in this machinery are : ( a ) clathrin coat assembly ( yAP180 proteins ) , ( b ) ubiquitination enzymes ( Rsp5p ) , and ( c ) actin - regulatory proteins ( Sjlp , End3p ) . These observations highlight the complexity of the endocytic system in yeast and mamma - lian cells . Further genetic and biochemical characteriza - tion should define the precise order of the reactions and the regulatory role Pan1p plays in these reactions .
