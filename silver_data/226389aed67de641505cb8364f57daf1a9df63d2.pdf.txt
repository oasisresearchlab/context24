Summary Mammalian gene expression is inherently stochastic 1 , 2 resulting in discrete bursts of RNA molecules synthesised from each allele 3 – 7 . Although known to be regulated by promoters and enhancers , it is unclear how cis - regulatory sequences encode transcriptional burst kinetics . Characterization of transcriptional bursting , including the burst size and frequency , have mainly relied on live - cell 4 , 6 , 8 or single - molecule RNA - FISH 3 , 5 , 8 , 9 recordings of selected loci . Here , we inferred transcriptome - wide burst frequencies and sizes for endogenous genes using allele - sensitive single - cell RNA - sequencing ( scRNA - seq ) . We show that core promoter elements affect burst size and uncover synergistic effects between TATA and Initiator elements , which were masked at mean expression levels . Importantly , we provide transcriptome - wide support for enhancers controlling burst frequencies and we additionally demonstrate that cell - type - specific gene expression is primarily shaped by changes in burst frequencies . Altogether , our data show that burst frequency is primarily encoded in enhancers and burst size in core promoters , and that allelic scRNA - seq is a powerful paradigm for investigating transcriptional kinetics .

E u r op e P M C F und e r s A u t ho r M a nu s c r i p t s E u r op e P M C F und e r s A u t ho r M a nu s c r i p t s It was postulated over 20 years ago that enhancers might increase the probability of transcription 10 , yet supporting data is scarce ( e . g . beta - globin in mouse 9 and sna in flies 8 ) and it remains unclear whether these observations generalize across different types of promoters and enhancers 11 . An important goal is therefore to determine how promoters and enhancers modulate gene expression through altering burst frequencies and sizes . Single - cell analyses of allelic transcription have revealed frequent monoallelic expression consistent with episodic transcription 12 – 14 . Inspired by recent developments in transcriptome - wide inference of burst kinetics 6 , 15 , 16 , we modelled the expression distribution at each allele independently 16 using the two - state model of transcription 17 . Profile - likelihood was used to infer point estimates ( using maximum likelihood ) and confidence intervals directly on burst frequency ( k on ; in units of mean mRNA degradation rate ) and size ( k syn / k off ; the individual parameters are unidentifiable in larger parts of parameter space ) ( Extended Data Fig . 1a - b , exemplified for Mbnl2 in Fig . 1a ; Methods ) . By simulations , we determined the boundaries of parameter space wherein kinetic parameters could be robustly inferred ( Fig . 1b ) , and how cell numbers and incomplete sampling ( i . e . sensitivity ) in scRNA - seq affected inference ( Extended Data Fig . 2 ) . To investigate transcriptome - wide patterns of transcriptional bursting , kinetic parameters were inferred for 7 , 186 genes using transcriptomes from 224 individual primary mouse fibroblasts for each allele ( CAST / EiJ × C57BL / 6J ) ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . Inference was performed on Smart - seq2 scRNA - seq libraries both at RPKM and molecule levels ( Methods ) , with improved goodness - of - fit towards the two - state model for molecule - level data ( Extended Data Fig . 1c - f ) . The inferred kinetic parameters inhabited regions in parameter space for which the estimated precision was high ( i . e . small confidence intervals ) for most genes ( Fig . 1b ) . Observed burst frequencies ( Fig . 1c ) and burst sizes ( Fig . 1d ) were in the range of those observed in imaging - based single - gene analyses 6 , and had a general relationship with expression levels ( Extended Data Fig . 1g - h ) similar to a previous study 18 . Kinetics inferred for the two alleles correlated ( Spearman r = 0 . 79 and 0 . 63 for burst frequency and size , respectively ) and were consistent with two independent transcriptional processes ( Extended Data Fig . 1i ) , as previously reported 12 . Incorporating gene - specific mRNA half - lives had minor effect on burst frequency estimation ( Fig . 1e ) , since burst frequencies had larger magnitudes of variation than mRNA degradation rates . Interestingly , the average waiting time between bursts were approximately 4 hours ( per allele ) ( Fig . 1f ) and inferred k on values were consistently much smaller than the corresponding k off values ( Fig . 1g ) , demonstrating that genes are mainly in an idle state with occasional bursts of transcription . We dissected molecular determinants of burst size variation . House - keeping genes tend to be highly expressed and have compact gene structure 19 . Indeed , we observed negative correlation between the gene loci length and burst size ( Extended Data Fig . 3A , Spearman r = - 0 . 86 , P = 2 . 3e - 228 ) but not burst frequency ( Extended Data Fig . 3B , r = 0 . 03 , P = 0 . 6 ) , and this effect was not associated with spliced mRNA transcript length ( Extended Data Fig . 3c ) . To assess the roles of core promoter elements on burst kinetics ( Fig . 2a ) , we formulated linear regression models that included gene length , TATA and Initiator ( Inr ) elements ( Methods ) which identified several significant factors and interactions ( Supplementary Larsson et al . Page 2 Nature . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2021 March 29 . E u r op e P M C F und e r s A u t ho r M a nu s c r i p t s E u r op e P M C F und e r s A u t ho r M a nu s c r i p t s Table 2 ) . Genes with TATA elements in their core promoters had significantly larger burst sizes ( P = 4 . 0e - 6 , F test , adjusted for gene length ) ( Fig . 2b ) than genes without TATA elements , in agreement with previous reports in yeast 20 and mammals 21 . In TATA - containing core promoters , we observed that the Inr element significantly boosted burst sizes ( P = 7 . 2e - 4 , F test , adjusted for gene length ) whereas Inr elements alone ( in promoters lacking TATA element ) had no effect on burst size ( Fig . 2b ) . Notably , the effects of the TATA and Inr elements were masked in mean gene expression levels ( Extended Data Fig . 3d ) and absent on burst frequencies ( Extended Data Fig . 3e ) . Thus , a separation of expression into burst kinetics was required to identify the effects of core promoter elements on transcriptional dynamics , since variations in burst frequencies distort the burst size effect at mean expression levels ( Extended Data Fig . 3f ) . The observed synergy between TATA and Inr elements significantly extends an earlier report of Inr elements positive effect on gene expression for promoters with TATA elements 22 . Interestingly , we observed distinct gene - length dependencies for the different core promoter elements ( Fig . 2c and Extended Data Fig . 3g ) and the effects declined around 80 kbp . We conclude that core promoter sequence elements affect burst size and that a transcriptome - wide inference of burst kinetics can deduce individual and synergistic effects of cis - regulatory elements on transcription . We applied the same procedure to 188 mouse embryonic stem cells ( mESC , C57BL / 6 x CAST / EiJ ) ( Supplementary Table 3 ) and determined kinetic differences between the 4 , 854 genes that were expressed ( and had inferable kinetics ) in both mESC and fibroblasts . We detected 1 , 552 genes with significant ( FDR < 5 % ) differences in burst frequency ( Fig . 3a ) and 1 , 075 genes for burst size ( Fig . 3b ) , with our current power to detect changes ( Extended Data Fig . 4 and Supplementary Table 4 ) . We next investigated whether alterations in burst sizes or frequencies account for cell - type specific differential expression . When binning genes by expression difference between the cell types it became apparent that cell - type - specific expression levels are mainly shaped by changes in burst frequencies ( Fig . 3c and Extended Data Fig . 5a - d ) . We hypothesised that burst frequencies were generally regulated by enhancers 8 – 10 . A strong linear dependence was observed between differential enhancer activity ( normalized H3K27Ac ChIP - seq read density in enhancer regions ) and differential burst frequencies ( Fig . 3d and Extended Data Fig . 5e - f ) , with only a modest effect of burst size , providing genome - wide support for enhancer - mediated regulation of burst frequencies . To validate the allele - level kinetics using a complementary method , we performed single - molecule RNA FISH ( smFISH ) on male fibroblasts and mESCs for a selection of X - linked genes ( expressed from a single allele ) with significant cell - type differences in burst frequencies or size ( Hdac6 , Msl3 , Mpp1 ) and without significant differences ( Ibgp1 ) ( Extended Data Fig . 6 ) . We observed a general agreement between methods in burst frequencies with some discrepancies and larger burst size estimates in the smFISH data ( Extended Data Figs . 7a - f ) . Importantly , significant cell - type differences were corroborated in the kinetics inferred from the smFISH data as we observed significant increase in burst frequencies ( Hdac6 , in ES cells ; Msl3 , in fibroblasts ) and burst size ( Mpp1 , in fibroblasts ) using both methods ( Fig . 3e and Extended Data Fig . 7g - j ) . To further investigate the effects of enhancers on burst frequencies , we identified genes with significant kinetics differences between the C57 and CAST allele in fibroblasts ( Burst frequency : 307 genes ; Burst size : 276 genes ) ( Fig . 4a - b , Extended Data Fig . 8a - d and Larsson et al . Page 3 Nature . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2021 March 29 . E u r op e P M C F und e r s A u t ho r M a nu s c r i p t s E u r op e P M C F und e r s A u t ho r M a nu s c r i p t s Supplementary Table 5 ) . Interestingly , genes with burst frequency differences had significantly higher densities of single - nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in their enhancer regions ( Fig . 4c ) but not in their promoters ( Extended Data Fig . 5g ) . No effect was found when performing similar analyses on genes with significant differences in burst sizes ( data not shown ) . That genes with strain - specific burst frequency have more genetic changes in their enhancers supports the notion of enhancers regulating burst frequencies . To functionally assess whether enhancers regulate burst frequencies , we sequenced and inferred transcriptional kinetics from 57 normal mESCs ( CAST / EiJ x 129SvEv ) and 174 mESCs harbouring a Sox2 enhancer deletion on the CAST allele 23 ( Fig . 4d ) . Markedly , cells with Sox2 enhancer deletion had significantly ( P < 4 . 2e - 40 ) reduced Sox2 burst frequency specifically on the affected CAST allele ( Fig . 4e ) , whereas no significant change in burst size was observed ( P = 0 . 48 ) . By simulations , we demonstrated that the observed kinetics for the affected CAST allele was in the region of parameter space expected for an exclusive reduction in burst frequency ( Fig . 4e , green region ; Methods ) . This provides direct evidence for the role of enhancers in modulating transcriptional frequencies and validates that allele - sensitive scRNA - seq is sufficiently accurate to infer transcriptional kinetics after a perturbation . The conservation of gene expression patterns and levels among mammals have been extensively studied 24 , still little is known about the conservation of transcriptional kinetics . We inferred transcriptional kinetics for 2 , 484 genes in 163 human fibroblast cells after phasing their transcribed SNPs . One - to - one orthologs ( 1 , 609 genes ) showed significant positive correlations in burst frequency , size and mean expression ( Extended Data Fig . 9a , b , c and Supplementary Table 6 ) . Interestingly , kinetic parameters were more similar across species than expected merely by preserved expression levels ( Extended Data Fig . 9d ) , although larger data sets would enable in - depth analysis . A caveat to inference of burst kinetics by scRNA - seq is that the estimates may be partly affected by cell - cycle features . A decreased burst frequency per allele 25 combined with an additional copy of each allele after genome duplication would balance the numbers of RNA molecules recorded per allele in scRNA - seq . However , most cells analysed in our study were in the G1 phase , and genes with different kinetics between phases were mostly related to the cell - cycle functions ( Extended Data Fig . 10 ) . Transcription is regulated at multiple levels , including enhancer - promoter interactions 11 , the formation of the transcription preinitiation complex ( PIC ) , recruitment of RNA polymerase ( Pol ) II 26 , Pol II initiation 27 and elongation 28 control . Active transcription typically results in multiple Pol II complexes simultaneously transcribing the locus generating spurts of RNA molecules 21 . Such dynamics become averaged out in bulk RNA - seq data and obscured even in scRNA - seq when lacking allelic resolution . We have demonstrated the opportunities in analysing burst size and frequency to obtain a more accurate characterization of transcription . Mechanistically , specialized TATA binding protein - associated factors and TATA binding protein - related factors bind different types of core promoters 1 and our data suggests that such complexes ultimately affect burst size , potentially through modulation of subsequent steps such as RNA pol II elongation control 28 . Hundreds of genes had significant Larsson et al . Page 4 Nature . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2021 March 29 .

Our data provides transcriptome - wide evidence for the role of enhancers in controlling burst frequencies . Thus , the primary role of enhancers might lie in forming a PIC without effecting the size of the transcriptional burst . The strategy introduced here paves the way for unprecedented mechanistic insights into how burst size and frequency control are governed by cis - regulatory sequences and the systematic dissection of transcription .
