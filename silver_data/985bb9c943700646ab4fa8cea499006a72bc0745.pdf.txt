Korn , National Heart , Lung and Blood Institute , Bethesda , MD , and approved September 5 , 2012 ( received for review June 29 , 2012 ) The assembly of actin monomers into filaments and networks plays vital roles throughout eukaryotic biology , including intracellular transport , cell motility , cell division , determining cellular shape , and providing cells with mechanical strength . The regulation of actin assembly and modulation of filament mechanical properties are cri - tical for proper actin function . It is well established that physiolo - gical salt concentrations promote actin assembly and alter the overall bending mechanics of assembled filaments and networks . However , the molecular origins of these salt - dependent effects , particularly if they involve nonspecific ionic strength effects or spe - cific ion - binding interactions , are unknown . Here , we demonstrate that specific cation binding at two discrete sites situated between adjacent subunits along the long - pitch helix drive actin polymeri - zation and determine the filament bending rigidity . We classify the two sites as “ polymerization ” and “ stiffness ” sites based on the effects that mutations at the sites have on salt - dependent filament assembly and bending mechanics , respectively . These results estab - lish the existence and location of the cation - binding sites that confer salt dependence to the assembly and mechanics of actin filaments . ion - linkage ∣ structural bioinformatics ∣ persistence length ∣ polyelectrolyte T he polymerization of the protein actin into double - stranded helical filaments powers many eukaryotic cell movements and provides cells with mechanical strength and integrity ( 1 – 4 ) . Filament formation is favored when the total actin concentration exceeds the critical concentration ( C c ) for assembly - defined as the monomer concentration at steady state for ATP - actin , or the dissociation constant for the reversible - equilibrium binding reac - tion of monomer binding to ADP - actin filament ends . Accord - ingly , the C c of ADP - actin is linked to the filament subunit interaction free energy such that lower C c values reflect greater thermodynamic stability ( 5 ) . The effects of solution ionic conditions on the assembly and stability of actin filaments have been investigated for several decades ( 6 – 12 ) . The actin C c and ( monomer and filament ) con - formation depend on the nucleotide - associated divalent cation ( Ca 2 þ or Mg 2 þ ) as well as the type and concentration of ions in solution ( 6 , 7 , 13 – 15 ) , a behavior shared among characterized actins and their bacterial homologs ( 16 ) . However , it is not firmly established if these salt effects on actin filament assembly and mechanics originate from nonspecific ion effects ( e . g . , electro - static screening , counterion condensation , etc . ) and / or specific ion binding interactions , potentially at discrete sites . Identifica - tion of saturable cation binding sites with different affinities favors specific and discrete binding sites on monomers ( 8 – 10 , 17 ) , but the location of these sites and their contributions to filament assembly and stiffness are unknown . Here we identify distinct cation - binding sites at subunit inter - faces that regulate actin filament assembly and rigidity . Site - specific substitution of a charged amino acid at one of the sites modulates the salt dependence of filament flexural rigidity , while substitution at the second site alters salt - dependent filament assembly . These studies provide a structural and thermodynamic basis for cation - linked actin filament assembly and bending mechanics . Results and Discussion Specific Cation - Binding Interactions Promote Actin Polymerization . To determine if general ( i . e . , nonspecific ) electrostatic screening or specific cation - binding interactions dominate the effects of salts on actin filament assembly , we evaluated how the cation depen - dence of the C c compares to predictions made by general and specific ion - binding theories . We focused on the abundant intra - cellular cations K þ and Mg 2 þ , as well as Ca 2 þ and Na þ . We uti - lized ADP - actin to eliminate cation effects on ATP hydrolysis and phosphate release , and because filaments assembled from ATP - actin monomers are comprised of > 95 % ADP subunits at steady state and therefore ADP - actin monomers dominate the mechan - ical behavior of actin filaments . For our C c measurements , we assembled ADP - actin filaments from ADP - actin monomers to eliminate ATP hydrolysis and mixed nucleotide state effects at filament ends , which determine the C c . The ADP - actin C c depends on the concentration and type of cations in solution ( Figs . S1 and S2 ) . This observation indicates that the actin filament thermodynamic stability depends on solution cations ( 18 – 20 ) , since the C c of ADP - actin reflects the free energy associated with filament subunit incorporation ( Δ G ° 0 polym ) according to Δ G ° 0 polym ¼ − RTln K polym , where K polym is a macroscopic overall equilibrium constant for incor - poration of monomers into filaments . We emphasize that K polym is an “ observed ” binding constant under given experimental con - ditions ( e . g . , salt concentration ) , defined only by the reaction between monomers and filament ends , and does not explicitly account for contributions from linked equilibria such as ion bind - ing . We note that this relation holds only for ADP - actin since it assembles following a reversible equilibrium reaction , and there - fore C c reflects the ( average ) affinity of ADP - actin monomers for filament ends . Assembly of ATP - actin , on the other hand , has additional linked equilibria ( e . g . , ATP hydrolysis and P i release ) , and the barbed and pointed filament ends vary in nucleotide com - position ( 21 , 22 ) . The C c of ATP - actin monomers is therefore more accurately described as the monomer concentration once polymerization has reached steady - state . The value of K polym does not scale with the solution ionic strength independent of ion type ( Fig . S3 ) , indicating that the effects of various salts on actin filament thermodynamic stability are specific and not purely ionic - strength effects . Hence , salt effects on actin polymerization reflect differential binding — to Author contributions : H . K . , M . J . B . , B . R . M . , E . R . , and E . M . D . L . C . designed research ; H .

We therefore interpret the salt dependence of C c according to established formalisms of linked binding equilibria ( 25 ) . The following scheme defines the overall reaction for reversi - ble ion - linked actin polymerization : E i þ A þ nI ⇄ K T E i þ 1 I n ; [ 1 ] where E i and E i þ 1 are the ends of filaments comprised of i or i þ 1 subunits , A is a free actin monomer , n is the net number of ions ( I ) taken up per incorporated filament subunit , and K T is the overall thermodynamic equilibrium constant for subunit addition that accounts for the linked ion binding reaction , defined by : K T ¼ ½ E i þ 1 I n (cid:1) ½ E i (cid:1)½ A (cid:1)½ I (cid:1) n ¼ K polym (cid:1) 1 ½ I (cid:1) n (cid:2) : [ 2 ] Eq . 2 can be expressed in a linear form by taking the log of both sides and rearranging : log K polym ¼ log K T þ n log ½ I (cid:1) ; [ 3 ] thereby permitting the net change in number of actin - associated ions ( n ) upon polymerization to be estimated from the slope of the double log plot of K polym versus cation activity , given by the product of [ cation ] and the ionic strength - dependent activity coef - ficient ( γ ) ( 26 ) ( Fig . 1 ) . Actin filaments are linear polymers with net negative charge , so we expect that the salt effects here are due to cation interaction with the polymer . Accordingly , we restrict analysis and discussion of the linkage of different cations in the presence of identical counterions . The cation dependence of C c indicates that approximately 1 net Mg 2 þ , Ca 2 þ , or K þ associates per actin subunit upon incor - poration into filaments ( Fig . 1 ) . This value agrees with a previous study showing that binding of a single low - affinity Mg 2 þ is linked to actin polymerization induced by MgCl 2 ( 15 ) . Approximately half as many net Na þ are taken up per actin monomer during polymerization . The difference between K þ and Na þ is consis - tent with ionic species - specific effects that are not Coulombic . The intercept value of K polym extrapolated to 1M cation is related to the intrinsic binding free energy of an actin subunit and asso - ciated cation with a filament end ( 27 , 28 ) . These values are not identical for all cations evaluated , suggesting that filaments assembled with different cationic species have variable thermo - dynamic stabilities and salt - dependent conformational distribu - tion ( s ) ( 6 , 7 , 20 , 29 , 30 ) . Cation Binding Stiffens Actin Filaments . Electrostatic potential changes due to both screening and ion binding play a critical role in the structure and mechanical properties of charged biopoly - mers including DNA and RNA ( 25 , 27 , 28 ) . For example , the partial neutralization of phosphates with monovalent cations lowers the rigidity of DNA ( 31 ) . Considering that actin filaments are polyampholytes that behave like negatively charged linear polyelectrolytes ( 32 , 33 ) , it is conceivable that screening and / or cation binding play an important role in actin filament flexural rigidity . However , the molecular mechanism of cation effects on actin filament mechanics remains elusive . We evaluated the salt dependence of actin filament flexural rigidity by directly visualizing filaments undergoing thermally driven fluctuations in shape and calculating their bending persis - tence lengths ( L p ) from the average angular correlation along their contour length ( 34 , 35 ) . Because filament contour lengths are comparable to L p , small changes in filament rigidity yield readily detectable changes in filament shape ( Fig . S4 ) . The actin filament - bending L p increases approximately 4 - fold from 3 . 5 μ m to 12 . 7 μ m over the range of salt concentrations evaluated ( 0 . 5 – 5 mM for divalent cations , and 10 – 250 mM for monovalent cations ; Fig . 2 ) , indicating that cations stiffen actin filaments . The stiffening effects of divalent cations continue to increase at concen - trations higher than those needed for polymerization ( Fig . S5 ) . The two distinct [ cation ] regimes over which L p and C c vary suggest that additional cation interactions at sites distinct from those required for polymerization modulate the filament bending rigidity . The effects of salt on actin filament L p could result from elec - trostatic screening as addressed by the Odijk - Skolnick - Fixman ( OSF ) ( 36 , 37 ) and Manning theories ( 38 ) and / or specific cation binding . The L p of polyelectrolytes , including DNA ( 38 – 40 ) , di - minishes with salt ( < 10 mM Na þ or < 1 mM Mg 2 þ ) . In marked contrast , the L p of actin filaments increases with [ salt ] ( Fig . 2 ) , indicating that actin filaments behave differently from DNA . It is possible that the salt - dependent increase in actin filament L p arises from neutralization or screening of repulsive interactions , thereby increasing the subunit interface area and / or intersubunit interaction energy ( 41 ) . However , data presented below support a mechanism in which cation binding to a discrete site helps reg - ulate the bending stiffness of actin filaments . Structural Bioinformatics Predicts Two Discrete Actin Filament - Specific Cation - Binding Sites . The salt dependence of actin filament thermodynamic stability ( C c ) and bending rigidity ( L p ) is best de - scribed by specific cation - binding interactions rather than general electrostatic screening effects . We therefore utilized a structural bioinformatics approach ( SI Text ) to predict the location of actin Fig . 1 . Specific cation binding drives actin polymerization .

We tested our predictions with experiments where site - specific mutations were engineered within the most highly ranked predicted sites ( SI Text ) . We employed WebFEATURE ( 42 ) with our own customized scripts ( Materials and Methods and SI Text ) to identify potential filament - specific cation binding sites distinct from the low affinity cation binding sites of monomers ( 8 ) . Our procedure ( SI Text ) predicts two filament - specific cation binding sites on actin . Both sites are formed by residues from two adjacent filament subunits , such that coordinated cations are specifically positioned between neighboring subunits along the long - pitch helix ( Fig . 3 ) . We refer to the two predicted actin filament - specific cation binding sites as “ polymerization ” and “ stiffness ” sites based on the following observations . The polymerization site is located between subdomains 3 and 4 of adjacent filament subunits . Re - sidues comprising our predicted polymerization site ( rendered as ball and stick in Fig . 3 ) are conserved among the vast majority of actins ( 43 ) . Mutations within this predicted site can render cytoplasmic actin nonpolymerizable ( 44 ) and can be lethal in S . cerevisiae ( herein referred to as yeast ) ( 45 ) . We note that an acidic residue within 3 Å of the polymerization site ( Asp288 ) is predicted to have a pK a shifted from approximately 4 to 7 . 1 [ using PROPKA software ( 46 ) ] when incorporated within a filament ( SI Text ) . Consequently , protonation at this site may account for the filament stabilizing effects of decreasing the solu - tion pH ( 47 ) . In this manner , protonation behaves analogous to cation binding . The stiffness site is comprised largely by residues within the DNAse I binding loop ( DB - loop ) of subdomain 2 but also in - cludes Glu167 within subdomain 3 of an adjacent subunit . Most actins have an acidic residue at position 167 in the stiffness site ( 43 ) . However , Ala occupies this site in yeast actin and yeast actin filaments are more compliant in bending than their vertebrate counterparts ( 35 ) . Substitutions at Predicted Sites Modulate Cation - Dependent Rigidity and Polymerization . The lack of an acidic residue ( Glu167 ) in the stiffness site of yeast actin filaments suggests that weak cation binding and occupancy at this site render them more flexible than vertebrate filaments . Consistent with this hypothesis , the bending rigidity of wild - type ( wt ) yeast actin filaments depends weakly , if at all , on [ Mg 2 þ ] ( Fig . 4 ) . In contrast , yeast actin filaments engi - neered with Glu167 at the stiffness site ( A167E ) display a strong Mg 2 þ - dependent rigidity ( Fig . 4 ) similar to vertebrate actin fila - ments ( Fig . 2 ) , without affecting the C c for polymerization ( 30 ) . We note that despite sharing salt - dependent rigidity , the L p va - lues of vertebrate and A167E yeast actin filaments differ at any given salt concentration . This behavior is not surprising given that contacts between the two long - pitch helical strands of yeast actin filaments are less extensive than those of muscle actin ( 48 ) and that filament mechanical properties ( e . g . , flexural rigidity ) are in - fluenced greatly by the filament subunit interaction energies and interface areas ( 41 , 49 – 51 ) . Similar to vertebrate actin ( Fig . S2 ) , the C c of wt yeast actin depends on the cation concentration and approaches a minimum value at approximately 1 – 5 mM Mg 2 þ ( Fig . 5 ) . Such comparable behavior is expected given the strict conservation of polymeriza - tion site residues between both actin isoforms . High - resolution structures of actin dimers reveal that T203 and D288 can be with - in hydrogen - bonding distance ( approximately 2 . 9 Å ) ( 52 , 53 ) . Therefore , we mutated the highly conserved T203 at the polymer - ization site , which could potentially participate in direct cation binding and / or orienting D288 through H - bonding for proper co - ordination geometry of the bound cation . Disruption of the yeast actin polymerization site with the mutation ( T203C ) shifts the Mg 2 þ - dependence of C c ( Fig . 5 ) , in accord with a reduction in the Mg 2 þ binding affinity . This behavior strongly supports the existence and location of the cation binding site that drives actin polymerization . Conclusion We predict the existence and identify the locations of two distinct , filament - specific classes of cation - binding sites on actin . We refer to these as “ polymerization ” and “ stiffness ” sites given the effects that mutations in the sites have on salt - dependent assembly and bending rigidity . Occupancy of the polymerization site drives actin filament assembly , while occupancy of the stiffness site modulates filament bending rigidity . Stiffness sites are located at the interface between the DB - loop and SD3 of adjacent sub - units , consistent with DB - loop conformation and remodeling playing an important role in determining overall actin filament mechanics and structural dynamics ( 6 , 7 ) .

Binding of the actin filament regulatory protein , cofilin ( 55 ) , is coupled to stiffness site reorganization ( 56 ) , cation release ( 33 ) , and enhanced actin filament bending ( 34 , 35 , 50 ) and twist - ing ( 57 ) , suggesting that displacement of stiffness site cations contributes to the effects of cofilin on actin filament mechanics . The work presented here favors a general mechanism in which cation binding to discrete filament - specific sites is the dominant effect underlying salt - dependent actin polymerization and fila - ment bending mechanics . Materials and Methods Proteins . Actin was isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle acetone powder , gel filtered over Sephacryl S - 300 equilibrated in buffer A ( 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 5 mM DTT , 1 mM NaN 3 , 2 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 ) , and fluorescently labeled with pyrenenyl - iodoacetamide or Alexa 488 - succimidyl ester ( Mole - cular Probes , Eugene , OR ) as described ( 34 , 58 ) . The labeling efficiency was 0 . 85 – 0 . 90 fluorophore per actin . Yeast actins were purified using DNAse I affinity chromatography with the previously described modifications ( 59 ) and labeled with Alexa 488 - succimidyl ester ( Molecular Probes ) as described ( 34 , 58 ) , where indicated . Ca - ATP - G - actinwasconvertedintoMg - ATP - G - actinwith200 μ MEGTAand MgCl 2 equal to the [ G - actin ] plus 10 μ M . Mg - ADP actin monomers were pre - pared by depleting free ATP from a solution of 50 μ M Mg - ATP - actin mono - mers with Dowex - 1 beads , followed by addition of 20 U ∕ mL of hexokinase , 200 μ M ADP , and 1 mM glucose , and incubated for 3 h on ice ( 60 – 62 ) . K þ - ADP actin monomers were prepared by adding 1 mM K þ - ADP , 1 mM K þ – EGTA , 1 mM K þ – EDTA , 20 U ∕ mL hexokinase , and 1 mM glucose to Ca - ATP actin monomers in buffer A . Ca 2 þ - ADP - and Na þ - ADP - actin were prepared using the respective salts . Determination of the Critical Concentration for Actin Polymerization . Actin monomers were polymerized at room temperature with 0 . 1 volume of 10 × polymerization buffer containing 10 mM Tris ( pH 7 . 5 at 25°C ) , 1 mM DTT , 1 mM ADP ( ATP for yeast actin ) , and a range of the indicated salt concentrations . Polymerized samples were briefly sonicated in a water bath , diluted to a series of desired final concentrations ( 0 . 05 – 25 μ M ) , and equili - brated for 4 – 6 h . The fluorescence emission ( λ ex ¼ 365 nm ; λ em ¼ 400 – 420 nm ) of equilibrated rabbit skeletal actin ( 5 % pyrene labeled ) samples were measured at 25°C with a Varian Cary spectrofluorometer ( Agilent Tech - nologies , Palo Alto , CA ) . The critical concentration ( C c ) was determined from the x intercept of the best fit of the [ actin ] dependence of the integrated emission peak intensities toa linear function after subtraction of actin mono - merbackgroundfluorescence . The C c ofunlabeled wild - typeandT203Cyeast actin was measured by light scattering at 400 nm ( 63 , 64 ) . Determination of the Actin Filament Bending Persistence Length . Images of Alexa - 488 labeled actin filaments that were thermally fluctuating in 2D were acquired for 100 ms using a Nikon Eclipse TE300 microscope equipped with a CoolsnapHQcooledCCDcamera ( RoperScientific , Tucson , AZ ) and μ Manager software ( National Institutes of Health ) . The depth of the sample was esti - mated to be < 3 μ m , which was necessary to ensure the 2D motion and thus preventtheactinfilament fromrotatingaxially ( 34 ) . Digitalimageswerepro - cessed and skeletonized using ImageJ software ( NIH ) . Single actin filaments longer than four pixels ( 0 . 18 μ m ∕ pixel ) were automatically detected using a custom Matlab script , but any bundles were excluded . Detected filaments were reconstructed with an average third - order Bezier spline to minimize measurement errors ( 34 , 35 ) . The bending persistence lengths ( L p ) of actin filaments were determined from digitized images ( 20 images , n ≥ 200 fila - ments for each data set ) , by fitting the average angular correlation of seg - ment lengths ( s ) to the following 2D correlation function ( 34 , 35 ) : h C ð s Þi ¼ h cos ½ θ ð s Þ − θ ð 0 Þ(cid:1)i ¼ exp (cid:1) − s 2 L p (cid:2) [ 4 ] Actin Structures and Prediction of Cation - Binding Sites . We employed a struc - tural bioinformatics approach to predict potential cation binding sites on actin . We utilized the Ca 2 þ binding site model implemented within WebFEA - TURE ( 42 , 65 , 66 ) tocompare predictedsites ontheG - actinmonomer [ Protein DataBank ( PDB ) ID 1J6Z ( 67 ) ] , F - actin ( conformation ) monomer [ PDB ID 3MFP ( 68 ) ] , and F - actin polymer ( 3MFP “ biological assembly ” file comprised of 5 subunits ) . While the particular WebFEATURE model we chose was trained using the characteristics of Ca 2 þ binding sites from the Protein Data Bank ( 66 ) , we utilized the resulting HITs as predictions of general cation - binding sites with a range of possible affinities for specific cations . Individual . pdb files were edited ( using a text editor ) to include only protein and ADP atoms , and the5 - merF - actinmodel ( 3MFP “ biologicalassembly ” ) waseditedtohave consecutive chain identifiers ( A , B , C , D , E ) to better keeptrack ofindividual site predictions and for visualization software ( VMD ) ( 69 ) . We compared WebFEATURE Ca 2 þ binding site predictions ( HITs ) between the G and F conformations of the actin monomer and between the F confor - mation of the monomer with the F - actin polymer . For the first comparison , the G - actin monomer predictions were subtracted from F - actin monomer predictions . For the second comparison , F - actin monomer predictions were subtracted from F - actin polymer predictions ( SI Text ) . Identification of Discrete Actin Filament - Specific Cation - Binding Sites . Following theabovesubtractionprocess , wegroupedclustersofHITsinordertogenerate individual cation - binding site predictions . The highest - scoring WebFEATURE HITs tend to occur in clusters of points on a regular grid pattern ( WebFEATURE uses a 1 . 5 - Å grid ) . Cation - binding sites in proteins typically include several co - ordinating atoms about 2 . 1 – 4 . 8 Å from the metal center ( 70 ) . To capture this behaviorinourpredictionofdiscretecation - bindingsitesonactin , wegrouped individual WebFEATURE HITs based on series of steps described in SI Text . We ranked the predicted discrete cation - binding sites according to the total prediction score of each cluster of HITs from WebFEATURE . We focused on the highest - scoring predicted cation - binding sites generated for each of the two comparisons : F - actin conformation monomer vs . G - actin , and F - actin polymer vs . F - actin conformation monomer . Fig . 4 . The “ stiffness site ” controls the cation dependence of actin filament rigidity .

Structuralbioinformaticsprocedurefor predictionoffilament - specificcationbindingsites I . Selected actin structures . The following modifications were performed before using these files to predict cation - binding sites : For 1J6Z [ Protein Data Bank ID number , ( 1 ) ] , all non - protein atoms ( including water , tetramethylrhodamine - 5 - maleimide , and six Ca 2 þ ions ) were stripped from the file except for those belonging to the bound ADP molecule . This allowed for a fair comparison with 3MFP ( 2 ) , which only contains a bound ADP molecule in addition to the protein atoms . Besides the Fand G conformations , the only difference between the actin monomer files submitted for ca - tion - binding site prediction was that 1J6Z contains three fewer residues ( Asp - Glu - Asp ) at the N terminus than 3MFP . 1J6Z is also missing the last three residues ( Lys - Cys - Phe ) , which were not resolved in the structure . Therefore predicted cation - bind - ing sites near these additional residues in the F - actin monomer ( 3MFP ) were ignored for the purpose of comparing with the G - actin monomer ( 1J6Z ) . Neither 1J6Z nor 3MFP contain the N - terminal Met and Cys residues indicated in the represen - tative mammalian skeletal muscle actin sequence from the National Center for Biotechnology Information ( NCBI ) protein database with the name “ ACTS _ HUMAN . ” Both 1J6Z and 3MFP have an identical protein residue - numbering scheme , which ends with 375 ( two shorter than ACTS _ HUMAN ) . II . WebFEATURE ( 3 ) Ca 2 þ binding site prediction model : The model was trained using structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank ( PDB ) that contain bound Ca 2 þ ions ( 4 , 5 ) , and uses a vector of 66 structural characteristics within a 7 - Å radius to score putative Ca 2 þ binding sites . We compared the positions of Ca 2 þ ions bound to the G - actin monomer ( 1J6Z ) to the top - predicted Ca 2 þ binding sites . Out of six bound Ca 2 þ cations in 1J6Z , WebFEATURE predicts two of the crystallographic Ca 2 þ sites ( to within 2 . 0 Å , including the nucleotide - associated site ) , the only two that have two or more acidic residues within 7 Å . The other four all have either one or zero acidic residues within 7 Å , which likely indicates a strong preference for the prediction algorithm to include acidic residues . Also , the pri - mary coordination shell of the other four crystallographic Ca 2 þ is mostly water oxygens ( two cases have only one protein atom in the first shell ) , which likely do not constitute “ strongly bound ” Ca 2 þ . III . Detailed subtraction process using VMD and custom Python scripts . 1 . The G - actin monomer ( 1J6Z ) was aligned with the F - actin monomer ( 3MFP ) , using the “ measure fit ” command within the VMD Tcl scripting interface . Only backbone atoms for residues 4 to 372 ( both 1J6Z and 3MFP numbering ) were used to calculate the best - fit rotation / translation matrix . This matrix was then applied to all the G - actin atoms including the predicted cation - binding sites ( saved as single pseudo - atom residues named “ HIT ” in the WebFEATURE output ) . This resulted in cation - binding site HIT predictions from the G - actin structure that were moved into close proximity with HIT predictions from the F - actin structure , based on structu - rally equivalent protein residue positions between the G - and F - actin structures . 2 . We exhaustively considered each of the HIT predictions for the F - actin monomer and compared its position to all HIT predictions for the G - actin monomer . If any HIT prediction for the G - actin monomer was within 10 Å of any HIT pre - diction for the F - actin monomer , those F - actin HITs were ig - nored . This distance criterion is conservative in terms of iden - tifying discrete F - actin - specific binding sites . The results did not change significantly down to a distance of 6 Å ( larger num - bers of sites with lower summed prediction scores in step IV below ) , while greater than 10 Å starts to delete F - actin specific predictions that are not near any G - actin predicted sites ( or F - actin polymer vs . F - actin monomer below ) . In the limit of an overly large distance cut - off for comparisons , no F - actin - specific site predictions would survive this step . 3 . Any “ HIT ” predictions that survived step III . 2 above consti - tuted potential cation binding sites that were predicted to sta - bilize the F conformation over the G conformation of an actin monomer . 4 . We repeated steps III . 1 – 3 above , comparing the F - actin mono - mer ( 3MFP ) HIT predictions to the F - actin 5 - mer ( 3MFP “ biological assembly ” ) . This was achieved by iteratively align - ing the F - actin monomer ( including HIT prediction pseudo - atoms ) with each subunit of the F - actin 5 - mer following the procedure in step III . 1 above and saving the new monomer HIT coordinates for each of the five subunit alignment steps . Then step III . 2 above was repeated by looping over all of the F - actin 5 - mer hit predictions and ignoring any that were found within 10 Å of any F - actin monomer HIT prediction . IV . Predicting and ranking discrete binding sites : Criteria for grouping individual HITs using custom Python scripts . 1 . We considered only those HIT predictions that were not elimi - nated from the “ subtraction ” steps described above . 2 . We individually grouped HIT predictions for either the F - actin monomer ( after subtracting G - actin monomer HITs ) , or the F - actin polymer ( after subtracting F - actin monomer HITs ) as follows : a . We started with any HIT prediction and formed a new Group “ A ” ( or B , C , etc . ) b . We joined all HIT predictions within 4 . 5 Å of the starting HIT prediction into Group A ( or B , C , etc . ) . 4 . 5 Å was chosen as a conservative estimate of the maximum distance between any two neighboring residues that contribute to a single typical cation binding site , or conversely the minimum distance between neighboring cations occupying two adja - cent discrete cation - binding sites . c . We joined any HIT prediction within 4 . 5 Å of any other member of Group A ( or B , C , etc . ) and repeated this step until no other HIT predictions occured within 4 . 5 Å of any member of Group A . d . We selected a new HIT prediction that was not a member of Group A and repeated steps 2a to 2c above with each new Group ( B , C , etc . ) . We repeated this step until all HIT predictions from step 1 above were assigned to a Group ( including Groups containing only 1 HIT prediction ) . e . For each Group , we calculated its total prediction score based on the sum of all individual HIT prediction scores within that Group f . For each Group , we calculated its weight - averaged position Kang et al . www . pnas . org / cgi / doi / 10 . 1073 / pnas . 1211078109 1 of 4 as follows : r Avg : ¼ ∑ N i ¼ 1 w i ð r i Þ ∑ N i ¼ 1 w i [ S1 ] where r Avg : is the weight - averaged position of the group , r i is the position vector ( x , y , z coordinates ) of the i th HIT predic - tion within the Group , w i is the WebFEATURE prediction score of the i th HITwithin the Group consisting of N Web - FEATURE HITs . Actinresidueside - chainpKapredictions . We used the F - actin 5 - mer model deposited in the PDB by Namba and co - workers ( 2 ) as input for residue side - chain pK a predictions to determine if spe - cific residues show a shift in going from G - to F - actin in their predicted microscopic pK a that would put them into a range where changing the solution pH from > 7 . 0 to < 7 . 0 would pro - mote protonation of this specific residue . We chose to use the web - based implementation of the PROPKA software ( 6 ) . We found that the predicted pK a of only one protonatable side - chain ( Asp288 ) changes from near its model value ( 3 . 9 ) to a value in this “ interesting range ” ( 7 . 1 ) in going from the G - actin structure ( 1J6Z ) to any protomer of the F - actin model ( 3MFP 5 - mer ) that has an additional subunit toward the pointed end making longitudinal close - contacts with this residue ( three out of the five subunits ) while the other two subunits have a predicted pK a near the model value in the absence of inter - subunit contacts from the polymer lattice . 1 .
