Axisymmetric indentation of an incompressible elastic layer by a frictionless rigid sphere is considered . Estimates of the contact radius and the force required to produce a given indentation are given when the thickness of the layer is small compared to the contact radius . The elastic layer is either bonded to or slips along a rigid substrate . The estimates are obtained by asymptotically matching a lubrication - type expansion valid in the contact region to an edge layer expansion studied using the Wiener – Hopf technique . A substantially larger force is required to equally indent a bonded layer compared to a slipping layer . In the former case the force is inversely proportional to the cube of the layer thickness , rather than to the layer thickness itself , if the layer is free to slip .

The present problem is motivated by recent interest in using the atomic force microscope ( AFM ) as a microindenter of thin biological samples with the intent of determining the local elastic moduli of the tissue [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] . In such an application the AFM provides two signals , force and displacement . The force signal is the product of the stiﬀness of a calibrated cantilever and its deﬂection as measured by the movement of a laser beam reﬂected oﬀ the cantilever tip onto a photodetector . The displacement signal is proportional to the voltage applied to a piezo ( piezoelectric actuator ) , which is rigidly attached to the cantilever base . Since the piezo , cantilever , and sample are connected in series , the piezo translation is the sum of the cantilever deﬂection and the indentation of the sample . Thus the AFM provides the force - indentation relation for the material , which can be used to estimate elastic moduli , provided that a theoretical model for the mechanics of contact exists . The classical closed - form result of Hertz [ 4 ] ( see also [ 5 ] ) can be used when the elastic layer thickness is large compared to the radius of contact . However , numerical solution of a singular integral equation is required in the general case of the indentation of a ﬁnite elastic layer by a sphere [ 6 , 7 ] . Simple - to - use approximate solutions are important to develop for routine AFM work and indentation tests in general . For example , Haider and Holmes [ 8 ] derived an approximate solution for the indentation of a thin compressible elastic layer by a ﬂat - ended cylinder , and Dimitriadis et al . [ 3 ] developed corrections to the Hertz theory to account for ﬁnite thickness . In what follows , the steady indentation of an incompressible , homogeneous , isotropic , thin elastic layer by a frictionless rigid sphere is considered . The condition of material incompressibility , ν = 1 / 2 , where ν is the Poisson ratio , can hold for biological samples , when the time required to deform the tissue is small compared to the time required for water to ﬂow out of it .

The most relevant previous analyses of the present problem are by Aleksandrov [ 9 , 10 ] , who used formal asymptotic methods to obtain estimates for the case ν < 1 / 2 , and by Matthewson [ 11 ] , who obtained estimates for an incompressible material using less rigorous thin layer methods . The present analysis , using matched asymptotic expansions , corroborates Matthewson’s result to leading order . 2 . Formulation . Consider an incompressible , homogeneous , isotropic , linear elastic layer with Young’s modulus E and thickness h that is supported on a rigid surface . The problem is to calculate the force required to indent the material an amount δ with a rigid sphere of radius R . Since the problem is axisymmetric , the equations of equilibrium are ∂ (cid:1) σ rr ∂r + 1 r ( (cid:1) σ rr − (cid:1) σ θθ ) + ∂ (cid:1) τ rz ∂z = 0 , ( 1 ) ∂ (cid:1) τ rz ∂r + 1 r (cid:1) τ rz + ∂ (cid:1) σ zz ∂z = 0 , ( 2 ) where ( r , θ , z ) are the cylindrical coordinates , and the stress - strain relations are (cid:1) σ rr = 2 3 E(cid:15) rr − (cid:1) p , (cid:1) σ θθ = 2 3 E(cid:15) θθ − (cid:1) p , (cid:1) σ zz = 2 3 E(cid:15) zz − (cid:1) p , (cid:1) τ rz = 1 3 E(cid:15) rz , ( 3 ) where (cid:1) p is an isotropic pressure term required for an incompressible material . The strain - displacement relations are (cid:15) rr = ∂ (cid:1) u ∂r , (cid:15) θθ = (cid:1) u r , (cid:15) zz = ∂ (cid:1) w ∂z , (cid:15) rz = ∂ (cid:1) u ∂z + ∂ (cid:1) w ∂r , ( 4 ) where (cid:1) u and (cid:1) w are the radial and axial displacements . Deformation at constant volume demands (cid:15) rr + (cid:15) θθ + (cid:15) zz = 0 . ( 5 ) The spherical indenter is assumed to be rigid and frictionless , and for small defor - mations of the layer the indented portion of the sphere can be approximated by a parabola , so that on the free surface at z = h (cid:1) w ( r , h ) = − (cid:2) δ − r 2 2 R (cid:3) , r ≤ a , ( 6 ) (cid:1) σ zz ( r , h ) = 0 , r > a , ( 7 ) (cid:1) τ rz ( r , h ) = 0 . ( 8 ) Thus ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) deﬁne a mixed boundary value problem ; moreover , the contact radius a is unknown and must be determined as part of the solution ( Figure 2 . 1 ) . The parabolic approximation in ( 6 ) assumes that a / R (cid:3) 1 and neglects terms O ( r 4 / R 3 ) and smaller . This is permissible when the indentation is small such that δ / a = O ( a / R ) . On the rigid substrate surface , z = 0 , (cid:1) w ( r , 0 ) = 0 , (cid:1) u ( r , 0 ) = 0 , or (cid:1) τ rz ( r , 0 ) = 0 , ( 9 ) depending on whether the layer is bonded , (cid:1) u = 0 , or free to slip , (cid:1) τ rz = 0 .

Scaled coordinates are introduced into ( 1 ) – ( 9 ) , ρ = r a , ζ = z h , ( 10 ) as are the scaled dependent variables w = (cid:1) w δ , u = h a (cid:1) u δ , p = (cid:2) h a (cid:3) 2 h δ (cid:1) p E . ( 11 ) This scaling is motivated by two physical phenomena that are expected to occur when a thin region is compressed : the radial displacement should be larger than the axial displacement to conserve volume ( (cid:1) uha ≈ δa 2 ) , and the variation in normal stress across the thickness of the layer should be small . The pressure normalization anticipates this latter eﬀect and also results in a nontrivial balance of radial forces . The scaling introduces the thinness ratio , (cid:15) = h / a , which is assumed to be the basic small parameter . This results in the following scaled equations , 3 ∂p ∂ρ = ∂ 2 u ∂ζ 2 + (cid:15) 2 (cid:2) ∂ 2 u ∂ρ 2 + 1 ρ ∂u ∂ρ − u ρ 2 (cid:3) , ( 12 ) 3 ∂p ∂ζ = (cid:15) 2 ∂ 2 w ∂ζ 2 + (cid:15) 4 (cid:2) ∂ 2 w ∂ρ 2 + 1 ρ ∂w ∂ρ (cid:3) , ( 13 ) 0 = ∂u ∂ρ + u ρ + ∂w ∂ζ , ( 14 ) and boundary conditions on the free surface ζ = 1 , w ( ρ , 1 ) = − (cid:2) 1 − a 2 2 δRρ 2 (cid:3) , ρ ≤ 1 , ( 15 ) 3 p ( ρ , 1 ) = 2 (cid:15) 2 ∂w ∂ζ ( ρ , 1 ) , ρ > 1 , ( 16 ) ∂u ∂ζ ( ρ , 1 ) = − (cid:15) 2 ∂w ∂ρ ( ρ , 1 ) , ( 17 ) D o w n l o a d e d 12 / 31 / 12 t o 150 . 135 . 135 . 70 .

( 18 ) 4 . Contact region expansion and solution . Inside the region of contact , ρ ≤ 1 , the form of ( 12 ) – ( 18 ) suggests the expansion w ( ρ , ζ ) = w 0 ( ρ , ζ ) + (cid:15) 2 w 1 ( ρ , ζ ) + · · · ( 19 ) for (cid:15) (cid:3) 1 , together with similar expansions for u ( ρ , ζ ) and p ( ρ , ζ ) . Substitution of these expansions into ( 12 ) – ( 18 ) then gives the ﬁrst order problem 3 ∂p 0 ∂ρ = ∂ 2 u 0 ∂ζ 2 , ( 20 ) ∂p 0 ∂ζ = 0 , ( 21 ) 0 = ∂u 0 ∂ρ + u 0 ρ + ∂w 0 ∂ζ , ( 22 ) with the boundary conditions w 0 ( ρ , 1 ) = − (cid:2) 1 − a 2 2 δRρ 2 (cid:3) , ρ ≤ 1 ; ∂u 0 ∂ζ ( ρ , 1 ) = 0 , p 0 ( ρ , 1 ) = 0 , ρ > 1 , ( 23 ) w 0 ( ρ , 0 ) = 0 , u 0 ( ρ , 0 ) = 0 , or ∂u 0 ∂ζ ( ρ , 0 ) = 0 . ( 24 ) As will be seen , the last condition in ( 23 ) cannot be enforced and will be replaced by a matching condition . Equation ( 21 ) implies p 0 = p 0 ( ρ ) only ; i . e . , the pressure doesn’t vary across the layer to ﬁrst order . Then ( 20 ) can be integrated to give the radial displacement proﬁle for the bonded case , u 0 ( ρ , ζ ) = 3 2 p (cid:3) 0 ( ρ ) ζ 2 − 3 p (cid:3) 0 ( ρ ) ζ , ( 25 ) or u 0 ( ρ , ζ ) = c 0 ( ρ ) , p 0 ( ρ ) = c 1 ( 26 ) for the slipping case , where c 1 is a constant of integration . The ﬁrst order continuity equation ( 22 ) can then be integrated to give the axial displacement proﬁle for the bonded case , w 0 ( ρ , ζ ) = (cid:4) p (cid:3)(cid:3) 0 ( ρ ) + 1 ρp (cid:3) 0 ( ρ ) (cid:5) (cid:2) − 1 2 ζ 3 + 3 2 ζ 2 (cid:3) , ( 27 ) or w 0 ( ρ , ζ ) = − 1 ρ { ρc 0 ( ρ ) } (cid:3) ζ ( 28 ) for the slipping case . Applying the boundary condition ( 23 ) for the indenter proﬁle to ( 27 ) results in an ordinary diﬀerential equation for the pressure p 0 ( ρ ) for the bonded case , which can be integrated to give p 0 ( ρ ) = 1 32 a 2 Rδ ρ 4 − 1 4 ρ 2 + c 2 , ( 29 ) D o w n l o a d e d 12 / 31 / 12 t o 150 . 135 . 135 . 70 .

CHADWICK where c 2 is a constant of integration . It is similarly found for the slipping case that u 0 ( ρ ) = 1 2 ρ − 1 8 a 2 Rδ ρ 3 . ( 30 ) The contact region scaling and expansions fail to determine the constants c 1 and c 2 and the contact radius a . These can be found , however , by asymptotic matching to an edge layer constructed in a small neighborhood near ρ = 1 , where the curvature of the contact region is small relative to the layer thickness . 5 . Edge layer expansion . Let x = (cid:15) − 1 ( ρ − 1 ) be a stretched radial coordinate with origin at the edge of contact , and consider the expansions : w ( ρ , ζ ) = W 0 ( x , ζ ) + (cid:15)W 1 ( x , ζ ) + · · · , ( 31 ) u ( ρ , ζ ) = (cid:15)U 0 ( x , ζ ) + (cid:15) 2 U 1 ( x , ζ ) + · · · , ( 32 ) p ( ρ , ζ ) = (cid:15) 2 P 0 ( x , ζ ) + (cid:15) 3 P 1 ( x , ζ ) + · · · . ( 33 ) The stretched radial coordinate x makes h the dominant length scale and weakens the eﬀect of curvature by relegating the parameter a to higher order . Near the edge of contact the dimensional radial displacement and pressure are not as large as their original normalizations in ( 11 ) suggest , scaled , respectively , like (cid:15) − 1 and (cid:15) − 2 . That explains why the leading terms of ( 32 ) and ( 33 ) are , respectively , O ( (cid:15) ) and O ( (cid:15) 2 ) . Substitution into ( 12 ) – ( 18 ) then gives the ﬁrst order edge layer problem 3 ∂P 0 ∂x = ∂ 2 U 0 ∂ζ 2 + ∂ 2 U 0 ∂x 2 , ( 34 ) 3 ∂P 0 ∂ζ = ∂ 2 W 0 ∂ζ 2 + ∂ 2 W 0 ∂x 2 , ( 35 ) 0 = ∂U 0 ∂x + ∂W 0 ∂ζ , ( 36 ) with the boundary conditions on the free surface W 0 ( x , 1 ) = − (cid:2) 1 − a 2 2 δR (cid:3) , x ≤ 0 , ( 37 ) 3 P 0 ( x , 1 ) = 2 ∂W 0 ∂ζ ( x , 1 ) , x > 0 , ( 38 ) ∂U 0 ∂ζ ( x , 1 ) = − ∂W 0 ∂x ( x , 1 ) ( 39 ) and the boundary conditions on the substrate W 0 ( x , 0 ) = 0 , U 0 ( x , 0 ) = 0 , or ∂U 0 ∂ζ ( x , 0 ) = − ∂W 0 ∂x ( x , 0 ) . ( 40 ) These equations are simpler than the full equations since they represent indentation of a plane layer by a semi - inﬁnite step . The strategy is now to construct the far ﬁeld behavior of the edge layer solution so that matching to the contact region can determine the unknown contact radius a and pressure constants c 1 and c 2 . The problem can be recast as a Wiener – Hopf integral equation with a kernel being the free surface vertical displacement resulting from a point force applied to the free surface of a ﬁnite layer of inﬁnite horizontal extent in the ( x , ζ ) plane . The Fourier transform of this Green’s function plays a fundamental role in obtaining the far ﬁeld of the edge layer . D o w n l o a d e d 12 / 31 / 12 t o 150 . 135 . 135 . 70 .

Fourier transform of the Green’s function for the edge layer . The edge layer ( 34 ) – ( 36 ) can be written in the vector form 3 ∇ P 0 = ∇ 2 Q 0 ; ∇ · Q 0 = 0 , where Q 0 = ( U 0 , W 0 ) . These have the form of Stokes equations for the planar slow viscous ﬂow of an incompressible liquid . Therefore it is convenient to introduce a streamfunction ψ and let Q 0 = ∇ × ( ψ e y ) , where e y is a unit vector normal to the ( x , ζ ) plane to identically satisfy ∇ · Q 0 = 0 . The divergence of 3 ∇ P 0 = ∇ 2 Q 0 shows that P 0 is harmonic , and its curl shows that the vector potential ψ is biharmonic . Introduce the Fourier transform pairs f ( λ ) = 1 √ 2 π (cid:6) ∞ −∞ f ( x ) e iλx dx , ( 41 ) f ( x ) = 1 √ 2 π (cid:6) ∞ −∞ f ( λ ) e − iλx dλ , ( 42 ) so that the transformed equations for the pressure and vector potential are (cid:2) ∂ 2 ∂ζ 2 − λ 2 (cid:3) P 0 = 0 , ( 43 ) (cid:2) ∂ 2 ∂ζ 2 − λ 2 (cid:3) 2 ψ = 0 . ( 44 ) These have the solutions P 0 ( λ ) = b 1 cosh λζ + b 2 sinh λζ , ( 45 ) ψ ( λ ) = d 1 cosh λζ + d 2 sinh λζ + d 3 ζ cosh λζ + d 4 ζ sinh λζ , ( 46 ) where the constants b 1 , b 2 are determined by requiring that ( 45 ) and ( 46 ) are con - sistent with ( 34 ) and ( 35 ) . The constants d 1 , . . . , d 4 are determined from the trans - formed boundary conditions ( 39 ) , ( 40 ) . However , instead of the mixed boundary conditions ( 37 ) and ( 38 ) , the Green’s function requires only that the normal stress cor - respond to a point force . First note the following transformed quantities : U 0 = ∂ψ / ∂ζ , W 0 = iλψ , ∂U 0 / ∂ζ + ∂W 0 / ∂x = ∂ 2 ψ / ∂ζ 2 + λ 2 ψ ( shear stress ) , − P 0 + 2 / 3 ∂W 0 / ∂ζ = − P 0 + 2 iλ / 3 ∂ψ / ∂ζ ≡ σ ζζ ( normal stress ) . Here σ ζζ ( λ , 1 ) = − 1 corresponds to a negative unit force applied on the free surface ζ = 1 at the location x 0 = 0 . The transformed Green’s function G ( λ ) = W 0 ( λ , 1 ) = iλψ ( λ , 1 ) . Note that W 0 ( λ , 1 ) is a shortened notation for the transform of W 0 ( x , 1 ; 0 , 1 ) , which denotes the vertical deﬂection of the free surface ζ = 1 at an observation point x due to a point force located on the free surface at x 0 = 0 and is therefore a Green’s function . Determining the constants for the bonded case gives G ( λ ) = − 3 ( sinh λ cosh λ − λ ) λ ( 1 + 2 λ 2 + cosh 2 λ ) , ( 47 ) and for the slipping case , G ( λ ) = − 3 sinh 2 λ λ ( 2 λ + sinh 2 λ ) . ( 48 ) 7 . Wiener – Hopf integral equation for the edge layer .

CHADWICK stress σ ζζ ( x , 1 ) , x < 0 , that results in a step indentation . That relation is determined by the solution of the integral equation W 0 ( ξ , 1 ) = − (cid:2) 1 − 1 2 φ (cid:3) = (cid:6) ∞ 0 σ ζζ ( ξ 0 , 1 ) G ( ξ − ξ 0 ) dξ 0 , ξ > 0 , ( 49 ) where ξ = − x and φ = a 2 / ( δR ) . Because there are no horizontal boundaries for the Green’s function , it must have a diﬀerence argument since it can depend only on the distance between the source and observation points on the free surface . The diﬀerence kernel and the semi - inﬁnite integral distinguish this inhomogeneous equation as one for which the Wiener – Hopf method is applicable . A clear account of the method is given in Stakgold [ 12 , pp . 311 – 326 ] , which is followed here . The ﬁrst step is to extend the integration domain to −∞ < ξ < ∞ , with the use of left - and right - sided functions . A left - sided function is zero for ξ > 0 , while a right - sided function is zero for ξ < 0 . Introduce the notation that “ + ” and “ − ” subscripts denote right - and left - sided functions , respectively . Deﬁne w + ( ξ ) = − ( 1 − 1 2 φ ) H ( ξ ) , where H ( ξ ) is the unit step function , and w − ( ξ ) as the unknown deﬂection of the surface outside the region of contact in the edge layer . Then ( 49 ) can be written in the form w + ( ξ ) + w − ( ξ ) = (cid:6) ∞ −∞ σ + ( ξ 0 ) G ( ξ − ξ 0 ) dξ 0 , ∞ < ξ < ∞ , ( 50 ) where σ ζζ ( ξ 0 , 1 ) = σ + ( ξ 0 ) . The formal solution of this integral equation proceeds as follows . The Fourier transform of ( 50 ) is w + ( λ ) + w − ( λ ) = G ( λ ) σ + ( λ ) . Decompose G ( λ ) into a quotient G + ( λ ) / G − ( λ ) , where G + ( λ ) is regular in an upper half - plane Im ( λ ) > τ + , and G − ( λ ) is regular in a lower half - plane Im ( λ ) < τ − . It is important that a τ + and τ − can be found such that there is an overlapping strip of regularity . Then w + ( λ ) G − ( λ ) + w − ( λ ) G − ( λ ) = G + ( λ ) σ + ( λ ) . Now decompose w + ( λ ) G − ( λ ) into a sum s + ( λ ) + s − ( λ ) so that “ + ” and “ − ” functions can be separated ; i . e . , s − ( λ ) + w − ( λ ) G − ( λ ) = G + ( λ ) σ + ( λ ) − s + ( λ ) . If an overlapping strip of regularity can still be found , then each side is a diﬀerent representation of the same entire function , which must be a constant by Liouville’s theorem . The constant can be evaluated at any convenient location and turns out to be zero in the present case . Assuming that is the case , then σ + ( λ ) = s + ( λ ) / G + ( λ ) , and σ ζζ ( ξ , 1 ) can then be found by the inverse transform . 8 . Quotient decomposition of the transformed Green’s function . An analytic function f ( z ) , with f ( 0 ) (cid:13) = 0 , can be expanded as an inﬁnite product : f ( z ) = f ( 0 ) e f (cid:1) ( 0 ) z f ( 0 ) ∞ (cid:7) n = 1 (cid:8) 1 − z a n (cid:9) e zan , where the a n are the simple zeros of f ( z ) [ 13 , pp . 136 – 137 ] . This representation of an analytic function is useful in constructing the quotient decomposition . Consider the transformed Green’s function for the bonded case ( 47 ) and write it as G ( λ ) / λ 2 = g ( λ ) / q ( λ ) , where g ( λ ) = − 3 ( sinh λ cosh λ − λ ) / λ 3 and q ( λ ) = 1 + 2 λ 2 + cosh 2 λ . Note that g ( 0 ) = − 2 and g (cid:3) ( 0 ) = 0 , so that application of the inﬁnite product representation gives g ( λ ) = − 2 (cid:10) ∞ n = 1 ( 1 − λ / a n ) e λan , where the a n are the zeros of g . However , since the − a n are also zeros of g , it follows that g ( λ ) = − 2 (cid:10) ∞ n = 1 [ 1 − ( λ / a n ) 2 ] , where the a n are the zeros of g in the upper half - plane . Similarly , q ( λ ) = 2 (cid:10) ∞ n = 1 [ 1 − ( λ / b n ) 2 ] , D o w n l o a d e d 12 / 31 / 12 t o 150 . 135 . 135 . 70 .

Hence G ( λ ) = − λ 2 ∞ (cid:7) n = 1 [ 1 − ( λ / a n ) 2 ] [ 1 − ( λ / b n ) 2 ] , ( 51 ) and thus G + ( λ ) = − λ 2 ∞ (cid:7) n = 1 1 + λ / a n 1 + λ / b n , ( 52 ) G − ( λ ) = ∞ (cid:7) n = 1 1 − λ / b n 1 − λ / a n . ( 53 ) Note that G + is regular in the upper half - plane Im ( λ ) > − b 1 , while G − is regular in the lower half - plane Im ( λ ) < a 1 , where a 1 and b 1 are the upper half - plane zeros closest to the origin . The same procedure for the slipping case ( 48 ) leads to G + ( λ ) = − 3 4 ∞ (cid:7) n = 1 1 + λ / α n 1 + λ / β n , ( 54 ) G − ( λ ) = ∞ (cid:7) n = 1 1 − λ / β n 1 − λ / α n , ( 55 ) where the α n are the upper half - plane zeros of − 3 sinh 2 λ / λ 2 , and the β n are those of ( 2 λ + sinh 2 λ ) / λ . 9 . Sum decomposition . It remains to determine the functions s + ( λ ) and s − ( λ ) , the upper and lower half - plane representations of S ( λ ) = w + ( λ ) G − ( λ ) , where w + ( λ ) = − ( 1 − 12 φ ) [ (cid:11) π / 2 δ ( λ ) − 1 / ( iλ √ 2 π ) ] is the transform of the step function , with δ ( λ ) the Dirac delta function , and G − ( λ ) is given by ( 53 ) for the bonded layer or ( 55 ) for the slipping layer . The strip of analyticity for S ( λ ) is 0 < Im ( λ ) < a 1 . As Stakgold [ 12 , pp . 311 – 326 ] explains , the decomposition S ( λ ) = s + ( λ ) + s − ( λ ) follows by an ap - plication of Cauchy’s integral theorem to a rectangle within the strip of analyticity . Application of his result to the present case gives s + ( λ ) = 1 2 πi (cid:6) ∞ + i 0 + −∞ + i 0 + S ( ζ ) dζ λ − ζ , ( 56 ) s − ( λ ) = − 1 2 πi (cid:6) ∞ + ia − 1 −∞ + ia − 1 S ( ζ ) dζ λ − ζ . ( 57 ) In evaluating the integral in ( 56 ) for s + ( λ ) we see that there is a direct contribution from the delta function . The remaining term can be evaluated by contour integration with a semicircle extending into the lower half - plane , where G − ( λ ) is analytic , leaving the only contribution due to a half residue at the origin . The result is s + ( λ ) = (cid:12) 1 − 12 φ (cid:13) i √ 2 πλ . ( 58 ) The constant s − ( λ ) + w − ( λ ) G − ( λ ) can be shown to be zero by letting λ → ∞ within the strip of regularity , since s − ( λ ) (cid:15) 1 / λ , G − ( λ ) → (cid:10) ∞ n = 1 a n / b n , and a n < b n , and D o w n l o a d e d 12 / 31 / 12 t o 150 . 135 . 135 . 70 .

CHADWICK w − ( λ ) → 0 , since w − ( ξ ) can be assumed to have exponential decay . That being the case , the solution of the integral equation is σ ζζ ( x , 1 ) = 1 √ 2 π (cid:6) ∞ −∞ s + ( λ ) G + ( λ ) e − iλx dλ . ( 59 ) 10 . Far ﬁeld behavior of the edge layer . The behavior of the integral in ( 59 ) as x → −∞ is required for asymptotically matching the edge layer expansion to the contact region expansion . Consider ﬁrst the bonded layer case , in which G + ( λ ) is given by ( 52 ) . The integral can be calculated by contour integration , using a contour comprised of a semicircle extending into the lower half - plane and a horizontal line just above the real axis . The integrand has a third order pole at the origin and simple poles at each − a n . The contribution of the semicircular arc vanishes as its radius goes to inﬁnity , and the simple poles contribute transcendentally small terms to the far ﬁeld . The residue at the third order pole at the origin is − 1 2 (cid:14) exp [ − iλx ] ∞ (cid:7) n = 1 1 + λ / b n 1 + λ / a n (cid:15) (cid:3)(cid:3) λ → 0 = − 1 2 (cid:14) ∞ (cid:16) n = 1 ( b − 1 n − a − 1 n ) − ix (cid:15) 2 . ( 60 ) Thus the dominant contribution to the far ﬁeld is σ ζζ ( x , 1 ) ∼ − 1 2 (cid:2) 1 − 1 2 φ (cid:3) (cid:14) ∞ (cid:16) n = 1 ( b − 1 n − a − 1 n ) − ix (cid:15) 2 . ( 61 ) Consider now the slipping layer case , where G + ( λ ) is given by ( 54 ) . The integrand of ( 59 ) now has a simple pole at the origin and simple poles at each − α n . As before , the pole at the origin is responsible for the dominant contribution to the far ﬁeld : σ ζζ ( x , 1 ) ∼ (cid:2) 1 − 1 2 φ (cid:3) G + ( 0 ) = − 3 4 (cid:2) 1 − 1 2 φ (cid:3) . ( 62 ) 11 . Matching in an intermediate domain . An intermediate variable x η is introduced to facilitate the asymptotic matching of the edge layer expansion to the contact area expansion . Let x η = (cid:15) − η ( 1 − ρ ) , η < 1 , so that x = − (cid:15) η − 1 x η → −∞ and ρ = 1 − (cid:15) η x η → 1 . Consider ﬁrst the expansions for the bonded layer case . The one - term edge layer expansion for the normal stress expanded in the intermediate variable is (cid:15) 2 σ ζζ ( x , 1 ) ∼ − 1 2 (cid:2) 1 − 1 2 φ (cid:3) (cid:14) ∞ (cid:16) n = 1 (cid:15) ( b − 1 n − a − 1 n ) + i(cid:15) η x η (cid:15) 2 ( 63 ) ∼ 1 2 (cid:2) 1 − 1 2 φ (cid:3) (cid:15) 2 η x 2 η + · · · .

Similarly , for the slipping layer case , the one - term edge layer expansion for the normal stress expanded in the intermediate variable is (cid:15) 2 σ ζζ ( x , 1 ) ∼ − 3 4 (cid:2) 1 − 1 2 φ (cid:3) (cid:15) 2 + · · · , ( 65 ) and the two - term contact region layer expansion for the normal stress expanded in the intermediate variable is − c 1 + 2 3 (cid:15) 2 ∂w 0 ∂ζ ( ρ , 1 ) = − c 1 + 2 3 (cid:15) 2 (cid:2) − 1 + 1 2 φρ 2 (cid:3) ∼ − c 1 − 2 3 (cid:2) 1 − 1 2 φ (cid:3) (cid:15) 2 + · · · . ( 66 ) These expansions agree if φ = 2 and c 1 = 0 . 12 . Contact radius and force . The contact force can be estimated to lead - ing order by integration of the dominant free surface normal stress over the area of contact . For a bonded thin layer the contact radius a = 2 √ Rδ , corresponding to the matching condition φ = 4 , and for a thin slipping layer the contact radius a = √ 2 Rδ , corresponding to the matching condition φ = 2 . These can be compared to the Hertzian contact radius a = √ Rδ for indentation of an elastic half - space by a rigid sphere . Integration of the dominant normal contact stress gives the forces F = 2 πER 2 δ 3 3 h 3 , ( 67 ) F = 2 πERδ 2 3 h ( 68 ) for indentation of the bonded and slipping layers , respectively . The relative error in each of these forces is O ( (cid:15) ) , which arises from applying the contact region normal stress in the edge layer . 13 . Discussion . The estimates for the force and contact radius were found by asymptotically matching a lubrication - type expansion in the contact region to the far ﬁeld of an edge layer expansion . Although numerical computations evidently have not been carried out for large values of a / h , where the present analysis should be valid , ( 67 ) does appear to be asymptotic to the results of Hayes et al . [ 6 ] , whose results extend to a / h ∼ 2 . That comparison is made in Dimitriadis et al . [ 3 ] . The analytical results can be partially compared to those of Aleksandrov [ 10 ] and Matthewson [ 11 ] . Aleksandrov considered a rigid frictionless sphere indenting a thin compressible elastic layer that was either bonded or slipped on a rigid substrate . His results clearly do not apply for an incompressible material in the bonded case . However , for the slipping case , no obvious singularities appear when ν = 1 / 2 . For that case he ﬁnds , to leading order , the same contact radius a = √ 2 Rδ , but a force that is larger by a factor of two . The discrepancy appears to be due to a diﬀerent limiting behavior of the compressible elasticity equations . Aleksandrov also analyzed the far ﬁeld behavior of an edge layer using the Wiener – Hopf technique , but matched instead to a lubrication - type expan - sion obtained by asymptotic analysis of Fourier integrals . The method presented here seems simpler , since the lubrication expansion is obtained more directly . Matthewson analyzed the bonded case using ad hoc polynomial displacement proﬁles and “patch - ing” of solutions inside and outside the contact region . The results here agree with his to leading order in the thinness parameter . The agreement is surprising because his D o w n l o a d e d 12 / 31 / 12 t o 150 . 135 . 135 . 70 .

CHADWICK assumed proﬁles are diﬀerent than what one ﬁnds from lubrication theory . Also , the patching technique leads to discontinuities in the radial derivatives of the solution , which are not physically plausible and therefore put his higher order terms in doubt . The present contact radius - indentation results can be used to estimate an upper bound on the layer thickness for which the force - indentation relations would be valid in an AFM experiment . Consider ﬁrst the case in which the thin layer is bonded to the substrate . Then from a = 2 √ Rδ , it follows that R / h = 1 / 4 ( a / h ) 2 h / δ . But h / δ > 5 , say , or else the small deformation assumption would be violated ; and a / h > 5 , say , or else the layer would not be thin enough for the theory to be valid . Therefore , h < 4 R / 125 , and if R < 15 µ m ( otherwise the weight of the microsphere will excessively distort the cantilever ) , then h < 500nm . This holds similarly for the slipping case , where a = √ 2 Rδ , h < 250nm . These present results can be extended in several ways . Higher order approxima - tions could be handled with the present method . Also , diﬀerent boundary conditions on the indenter could be of interest , as well as diﬀerent indenter shapes . Yang [ 14 ] recently obtained estimates for a ﬂat punch indenter and found the same dependence of the force on the layer thickness for the bonded and slipping cases as that found here . In the former case the force is inversely proportional to the cube of the layer thickness , rather than the layer thickness itself , if the layer is free to slip . Because of the large diﬀerence in force in the two cases , it would be of interest to obtain an estimate for the problem of partial bonding . A solution to that problem would be helpful in applying the AFM to studies of the focal adhesions of cells on substrates . Acknowledgments . The author would like to thank E . Dimitriadis , K .
