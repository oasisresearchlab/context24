Despite TRIZ official development ended in 1985 , researchers have continued its development by proposing new approaches ( e . g . OTSM , TRIZ + , SPARK ) or by extending existing ones . After all these efforts , the spread of TRIZ has never reached the level of capillarity expected . For this reason , in the last years , TRIZ community has interrogated more than once about the motivations for this slow growth . In order to accelerate the spread of TRIZ , many attempts were made to simplify the method , sometimes by integrating it with other methods ( such as FMEA , QFD , Lean ) that were already present in production plants and increasing TRIZ notoriety by publishing successful case studies . This work is an updated picture of the current situation of TRIZ case studies publications . More than 200 case studies from TRIZ journal and ETRIA TRIZ Future Conference have been collected , analysed and processed to understand Why companies needs TRIZ , which tools are the most used , how TRIZ has been integrated with other methods , and how industries and academies communicate their success . Differently to other surveys , this study also focuses on the ways in which solutions are presented , so as to identify best practices or new ideas and trends from a communication perspective . This paper contains the results of this analysis and the related comments . © 2015 The Authors . Published by Elsevier B . V .

Introduction Since its introduction , TRIZ has been used in various field of industry . Starting from Russia , where it was developed , it has spread through the whole world and its implementation is especially documented in Europe and North America [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] and [ 3 ] . However , after an initial exponential growing , the spread of TRIZ has never reached the level of capillarity expected . The spread of a methodology is , by itself , a positive index of its effectiveness in real application . But , are there other ways measure the effectiveness of TRIZ in industry ? Solutions coming from a problem solving activity , whether they comes from brainstorming , TRIZ or other methodologies , go through many obstacles before their implementation ; not always they become a commercial product and sometimes they can be considered not feasible . Problem Solvers around the world are nowadays involved in consultancy activities that can lead to a commercialized product , to a patent , to a consolidated procedure or other outcomes . Several factors , such as the kind of problem , the industrial areas , the involved people and others environmental parameters can affect both positively or negatively the outcome of a consultant activity based on TRIZ . Several authors [ 4 ] have analysed the major shortcomings in application , others have high - lightened peculiarities of TRIZ applications in restricted area , showing what approaches are more popular , but ever considering a complete analysis for an entire project . In this paper we classify past TRIZ - based consultant activity in industry that have been documented in literature by © 2016 The Authors . Published by Elsevier B . V .

Peer - review under responsibility of Scientiﬁ c committee of Triz Future Conference 52 Christian Spreaﬁ co and Davide Russo / Procedia CIRP 39 ( 2016 ) 51 – 56 considering an entire consultancy project . More than 200 papers from TRIZ journal , ETRIA TRIZ Future Conference and other major journal of engineering design ( Research in Engineering Design , International Journal of Product Design ) have been analyzed . The following graphs summarize the time distribution of the considered case studies . Even if the coverage is only partial , the sample has to be considered highly representative . In fact , from a first analysis of the technical areas covered by the survey , as shown in Figure 2 , there is a substantial alignment with the results of similar surveys previously made . ( i . e . [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] ) . Fig . 2 : Distribution of industrial sectors ( in % ) The goal of this analysis is to provide data to better understand what can influence the reputation of TRIZ . Specifically , the following questions are considered : (cid:120) What are the most important external factors and pre - requirements that influences the outcome of a TRIZ - based consultancy activity ? (cid:120) How the application of TRIZ changes when applied into different fields ? (cid:120) What are the most popular approaches to present the results obtained by TRIZ ? To do this , we have tried to analyze data after breaking down by type of purpose and problem solving activity . 2 . Why companies needs TRIZ Needs and goals in a TRIZ - based consultancy activity are intended as the reasons or motivation for the activity that has been planned . According to [ 6 ] , TRIZ is accepted in western companies thanks the capability to innovate a product more rapidly , increasing the competitiveness of the companies in an increasingly competitive market . Other applications can be found in situations where new laws constrain product to meet specific requirements [ 7 ] . For instance , the European Directive on Energy - related Products ( ErP ) have stimulated the application of TRIZ in eco - design and in energetically efficient buildings [ 8 ] . To achieve their needs , industrial planning can act at different levels ( strategic , tactical , operative , etc . ) and in many cases they implemented TRIZ in this activity . This survey shows that TRIZ was adopted in : (cid:120) Quality improvement : for ameliorating planned functionalities and requirements , especially for products [ 9 ] , systems [ 10 ] and services . TRIZ works in addition to the general quality improvement process [ 11 ] . (cid:120) Reduction of product pollution . (cid:120) Lunch of new product : supporting the launch of new product ( such as [ 9 ] ) or service during or before the conceptual design stages . (cid:120) Productivity improvement : for ameliorating the aspects related to manufacturing and management of processes ( e . g . [ 12 ] ) . (cid:120) Product / process innovation : improvements of existing products or processes by introducing new functions . (cid:120) Energy reduction ( i . e . [ 13 ] ) . (cid:120) Safety improvement . (cid:120) Cost reduction . Figure 3 shows for what purpose TRIZ was mostly used by users .

For this reason a deeper analysis was conducted on the documents with the aim of understanding what are the specific activities in which TRIZ was used . (cid:120) Early design : TRIZ is used for conceptual design , in order to identify alternative physical effects or define the behavior of a potential solution . Several examples show TRIZ integrated with Pahl and Beitz approach and FBS Function Behaviour Structure theory . (cid:120) Optimization and Robust design : TRIZ is used to support optimization stage during design , FEM analysis , and robust design . (cid:120) Decision making and Forecasting : TRIZ can lead a different prospective highlighting new business opportunities [ 14 ] and forecasting , such as [ 15 ] or [ 9 ] . (cid:120) Eco - design : TRIZ is used in an eco - design approach , especially to solve contradictions that emerged from the application of a partial solution . (cid:120) Design for X : TRIZ is used for improving product manufacturing , assembly and maintenance or for improving risk management models ( i . e . [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] ) . Figure 4 shows the absolute frequency of utilization of TRIZ in the different problem solving activities . Fig . 4 : Number of TRIZ case studies according to the design activities A further analysis has been conducted in order to analyze the relation between goals and problem solving activities . This data allow us to identify the precise areas of real use of TRIZ in industrial problems .

(cid:120) To reduce the pollution , where TRIZ is integrated not only to improve efficacy of eco - design guidelines ( 13 results ) but also for generating brand new concepts ( 10 results ) . (cid:120) To improve the products or the processes features and functionalities , TRIZ is used in the optimization phase ( 11 ) and more rarely for strengthen traditional tools as design for X . (cid:120) To improve the productivity . Here TRIZ is generally linked to Design for Manufacturing , Assembly and Maintenance ( 10 results ) , but also in optimization ( 7 ) and conceptual design ( 6 ) . (cid:120) For the launch of a new product TRIZ is used during conceptual design phases ( 13 results ) , more than optimization ( 8 ) or together with other specific tools ( 5 ) . (cid:120) Triz forecasting is used for launching a new product ( 4 ) than for product improvement ( 3 ) . 3 . Tools and methods for problem solving activities Applying TRIZ means to apply several different tools ( i . e . multiscreen , contradictions , inventive principles , etc . ) . Moreover , we can also integrate TRIZ method with other theories and approaches ( i . e . Quality Function Deployment , Functional Analysis , etc . ) . In the rest of the paragraph , we analyze the most popular TRIZ tools and integrations . 3 . 1 The most popular TRIZ tools Among TRIZ tools , some are more popular than others , like contradictions and inventive principles . Several studies have presented a frequency ranking and they have highlighted how the preferences are affected also by external factors as the field of application ( i . e . [ 9 ] ) . However , despite of the multitude of applications in industrial areas , the alternate success in the practice of everyday have lead the authors and the consultants to work on the customization of the methodology , flanking other theories to TRIZ method . The founded results confirm what founded in previously survey works ( i . e . [ 5 ] ) so the situation seems not changed during the years . 24 29 25 22 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 Rough idea of the functioning Concept ( Behaviour and… Detailed design Ready to market product 79 57 32 26 23 21 19 16 13 10 0 20 40 60 80 Contradictions Inventive principles Evolution laws IFR Su - field Standard solutions Separation principles TRIZ Functional analysis Multiscreen Effects and resources Fig . 6 : TRIZ tools frequency of utilization 54 Christian Spreaﬁ co and Davide Russo / Procedia CIRP 39 ( 2016 ) 51 – 56 3 . 2 TRIZ combined with other methods Several authors have commend the integration between TRIZ and other methods . [ 18 ] explain how for certain tasks , the use of only a restricted number of selected TRIZ tools integrated with other more suitable , precise or simply external instruments , may be preferable respect the forced use of the entire methodology . In general , integrations helps in the phases traditionally less developed by TRIZ method like the management of the requirements was improved in more rigorous manner , for example by [ 11 ] that integrates Quality Function Deployment . The functional analysis was instead developed in cause and effect chain representation with the introduction of Rough Cause Analysis and in functional representation , like [ 19 ] with the formalism of the Energy Material Signal theory . While decision making was improved in two manner , providing more objective judgments , with the fuzzy logic , and making it easier the evaluation , like [ 20 ] that introduces the principles of the Value Engineering . Figure 7 shows how TRIZ is mainly integrated with QFD , FMEA and in patent strategies / tools Fig . 7 : TRIZ combination with other methods 4 . How to present solutions with TRIZ inside There are many ways to present a solution . It may be just an idea or can be accompanied by a feasibility study , as well as by a real prototype or finished product . Each of these modes may be accompanied by simple design sketches , as well as by complex analysis and detailed procedure description . This section analyses the most frequently used mode of presentation of the solutions made with TRIZ . The level of detail with which a solution is presented has been divided as follows : (cid:120) Rough idea of the functioning ( Only behaviour / physical effects ) : a consultancy activity that produce a solution at this level of abstraction aims at exploring possible new physical effects to achieve the product functionalities . In this case , the structural aspects are secondary and they are used to test the behaviour . (cid:120) Concept ( Behaviour + Structure ) : when the solution have a structure quite similar to the final results but does not already satisfy the requirements of industrialization and marketability . (cid:120) Detailed design : if the product designed that can be produced and tested but is not yet ready for the market . (cid:120) Ready to market product : if the designed product is at its final level and can be introduced into the market . Figure 8 shows that the distribution of TRIZ case studies is uniformly distributed on different levels of detail . It also means that less than 25 % of cases studies deals with products already in the market today . There is a greater focus on the case studies in the planning stages . Sometimes the goodness of the results is not sufficient to decree the success of the consultancy , because the presentation of the results plays more and more a crucial factor . In order to provide best chances of acceptation to the proposed results , we have firstly to choice the level of detail and then the smarter modality of presentation . The choice of the correct level of detail can strongly affect the chances of acceptation of the idea and consequently the success of the consultancy . In this manner , more aspect of the idea can be better valorized ( like the behaviour and the physical effect ) without compromising it with a too precise and limited structural description , generally more attackable . After that , we have to define in which manner the idea can be presented . In the following we have reassumed the most common approach founded in our survey : (cid:120) Sketches : thanks to their simplicity and the immediacy are among the most common tool . Some of the most famous TRIZ software are based on this approach . (cid:120) Infographic : are generally more elaborated respect sketches and contains more complex information . They are generally used to present the results in relations to evolutive trends and benchmarking analysis . (cid:120) Diagrams and tables : they can support the product when a large mole of information are required by normative or to evaluate the performances in a wide range . (cid:120) Virtual model and animation , numerical simulation and statistical analysis : regard all the integration between TRIZ and CAD / CAE tools . (cid:120) Behavioral and Structured tests : provide information about the behaviour of the product during simulations . (cid:120) Prototype : the presentation of a structural or functional prototype is always a possibility especially when we want 2323 20 7655444 22223 0 5 10 15 20 25 QFDFMEA Patents db TOC BioinspirationFTATaguchiSix SigmaFBS Value analysisC - K EMS Environmental analysis Voice of Customers Others ( 5W , Brainstorming , Kano ) 24 29 25 22 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 Rough idea of the functioning Concept ( Behaviour and Structure ) Detailed design Ready to market product Fig . 8 : Number of case studies describing ideas , concepts or final products designed by using TRIZ 55 Christian Spreaﬁ co and Davide Russo / Procedia CIRP 39 ( 2016 ) 51 – 56 to valorize certain morphological or behavioural aspects especially for design artifacts . (cid:120) Algorithm and Procedure : can be the interface of presentation of a process improvement or of a software or of a new modality of usage of a certain product . Materials Requirements Planning ( MRP ) , Enterprise Resources Planning ( ERP ) , Total Quality Management ( TQM ) , Electronic Data Interchange ( EDI ) , etc . are only some of the possible ones . Despite the difficulties , we have tried to compare the modalities of presentation of the outputs with the obtained outputs and with the tools used together with TRIZ . In the first case , we have compared the interface of presentation with the achieved results . Please note that the achieved results are independent from the followed problem solving approach in order to understand in what manner we can better valorize what has been obtained through a TRIZ activity .

Anyway , algorithms , simulations and sketches seems to be most frequents . It is interesting that these interfaces are more exploited to explain how a conceptual solution ( or first prototypes ) have been reached rather than in paper that contain well - defined products . This because a real successful case study , that explicitly explains how many and in what manner TRIZ has contributed , is missing .

(cid:120) For decision making and forecasting , the most popular approaches are diagrams / tables and infographic . (cid:120) Eco - design and Design for X , there is no one single interface preferred to the others , except the algorithms that are used for explaining the methods rather than the solution . Through the founded results we can understand for what interfaces of presentation of the results have been spent more efforts to better valorize the TRIZ consultancy / case study . In particular the presentation of a proper model and procedure seems the most popular approach ; this means that the company seems to appreciate to convey the method . 5 . Conclusions In this paper , we have analyzed more than 200 papers about TRIZ applications in industry . We have analyzed and classified them according to the typical steps of a TRIZ - based consultancy activity with a particular focus on the way that Triz solutions are presented . We have noted that TRIZ community has a trend of publications that is substantially constant ( this analysis do not consider the new conferences in Asia ) and that TRIZ continues to be an universal method used for many different applications . It is often used for strengthening other methods , not only in 26 19 18 14 11 10 9 9 9 7 3 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 Algorithm / Procedure Diagrams and tables Numerical simulation Sketch Structural tests Virtual model Statistical analysis Behavioural tests Prototype Infographic Virtual animation Fig . 9 : Most popular interfaces of presentation used in combination with results 56 Christian Spreaﬁ co and Davide Russo / Procedia CIRP 39 ( 2016 ) 51 – 56 early design phases but also in the embodiment phases and to concretize final solutions ( e . g . to put a product on the market ) . This lack of specificity in TRIZ literature might be one of the causes that makes it less appealing and inhibits its evolution . The lack of predominant modalities to present an idea shows how this argument is still immature and left to personal talent rather than systematic practices . This paper have been preceded by previous analyses that obtained similar results with a very different approach . In that case , questionnaires instead of published case studies were used . Future development of this work regard the enlargement of the explored pool of papers by considering publications which are not from ETRIA , such Asian conference proceedings , and other international journals . This would allow a more robust statistical study . References [ 1 ] S . Savranski , Engineering of creativity . 2000 . [ 2 ] K . Rantanen and E . Domb , Simplified TRIZ . Lucie Press , 2007 .
