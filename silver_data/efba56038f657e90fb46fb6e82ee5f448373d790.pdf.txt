Construction of actin - based structures requires the polymerization of actin monomers into ﬁ laments , and the incorporation of these ﬁ laments into networks with precisely de ﬁ ned architectures ( Blanchoin et al . , 2014 ) . The speci ﬁ c geometric arrangements of the ﬁ laments within actin structures are stabilized via the association of crosslinking proteins , which bind two ﬁ laments simultaneously ( Michelot and Drubin , 2011 ; Blanchoin et al . , 2014 ; Lappalainen , 2016 ; Pollard , 2016 ) . The molecular properties of crosslinking proteins specify ﬁ lament spacing , orientation , and rotational freedom , and thus confer a unique set of mechanical properties to each structure ( Bartles , 2000 ; Winkelman et al . , 2016 ; Svitkina , 2018 ) . Crosslinking is a dynamic process that requires the assembly of actin ﬁ laments ( Blanchoin et al . , 2014 ) . In the cellular environment , actin polymerization and crosslinking occur simultaneously ( Mallavarapu and Mitchison , 1999 ; Vavylonis et al . , 2006 ; Tang et al . , 2015 ) ) , so these processes likely play interdependent roles in shaping the architectures and mechanical properties of actin - based structures . Recent studies have revealed that the rate at which actin ﬁ laments are generated in ﬂ uences the architecture of crosslinked networks assembled in vitro by alpha - actinin ( Falzone et al . , 2012 , 2013 ) . Alpha - actinin is a ﬂ exible crosslinker that assembles actin ﬁ laments into bundles that are characterized by a relatively wide inter - ﬁ lament spacing of 35 nm and exhibit mixed polarity ( Hampton et al . , 2007 ) . Increasing the rate of actin polymerization shifts the morphology of the structures generated by alpha - actinin from a population of sparse , thick bundles to a dense network of interconnected ﬁ laments ( Falzone et al . , 2012 , 2013 ) . However , it remains unknown how the assembly of crosslinked actin structures evolves over the course of polymerization , and whether the length at which ﬁ laments initially become crosslinked in ﬂ uences the overall topology of the resultant actin network . To answer these questions , we investigated how polymerization affects the assembly of simple , polarized actin bundles by the crosslinking protein fascin . Fascin is a monomeric actin - binding protein that localizes to protrusive cellular structures such as ﬁ lopodia , invadopodia , and dendritic cell membrane extensions ( Vignjevic et al . , 2006 ; Li et al . , 2010 ; Yamakita et al . , 2011 ; Yang et al . , 2013 ; Van Audenhove et al . , 2016 ) . These thin projections push against and deform the plasma membrane as they assemble and elongate outwards from the cell body ( Mallavarapu and Mitchison , 1999 ) , enabling them to play major roles in cellular motility , guidance , and invasion ( Mattila and Lappalainen , 2008 ; Svitkina , 2018 ) . The actin ﬁ laments that are assembled into protrusive structures are polymerized by formins and Ena / VASP family proteins ( Schirenbeck et al . , 2005 ; Breitsprecher et al . , 2008 ; Lizárraga et al . , 2009 ; Mellor , 2010 ; Jaiswal et al . , 2013 ; Arthur et al . , 2021 ) . These ﬁ laments are assembled into ordered arrays by fascin , which bundles actin ﬁ laments by binding cooperatively along their lengths ( Bryan and Kane , 1978 ; Yamashiro - Matsumura and Matsumura , 1985 ; Vignjevic et al . , 2006 ) . Fascin ’ s compact three - dimensional structure speci ﬁ es a relatively short inter - ﬁ lament distance of 8 nm ( Sedeh et al . , 2010 ; Jansen et al . , 2011 ) , and its preference for binding ﬁ laments that are aligned in parallel orientations confers polarity to the bundles that it assembles in vitro ( Courson and Rock , 2010 ) . As a result , ﬁ lament elongation primarily occurs at one end of each fascin - bound bundle ( Jaiswal et al . , 2013 ; Winkelman et al . , 2014 ) , consistent with the extension of protrusive structures in a single direction , away from the cell body . This topological feature facilitates direct measurement of bundle elongation within dynamically assembling ﬁ lament networks . Because protrusive structures elongate as they are assembled ( Mallavarapu and Mitchison , 1999 ) , we focused speci ﬁ cally on the effects of ﬁ lament elongation on fascin - mediated bundling . Using a formin to generate populations of actin ﬁ laments with lengths representing distinct stages of elongation , we found that the rate of bundle assembly increases with ﬁ lament length . We further observed that fascin assembles short ﬁ laments into topologically discrete bundles , whereas bundles of long ﬁ laments expand to form interconnected networks by incorporating additional ﬁ laments and forming stable , inter - bundle connections . Introducing actin monomers into reactions containing bundles of short ﬁ laments promotes their elongation and enables inter - bundle crosslinking . However , most connections formed between elongating bundles are short - lived and are followed by ﬁ lament breakage at or near the initial site of crosslinking . Taken together , our data reveal that initiation of ﬁ lament bundling early in elongation ( i . e . , when ﬁ laments are short ) establishes a template that constrains the ﬂ exibility of the bundle . This increases the resistance of the bundle to changes in curvature that are required to form stable , interconnected networks . As a result , bundles of short ﬁ laments remain straighter as they elongate than bundles assembled from long ﬁ laments . Thus , uncoordinated ﬁ lament elongation and crosslinking alters the morphology of actin bundles assembled by fascin , highlighting the importance of maintaining precise regulation of ﬁ lament length during the assembly of specialized actin structures . Materials and methods Protein puri ﬁ cation Actin was extracted from chicken skeletal muscle acetone powder and puri ﬁ ed by one cycle of polymerization and depolymerization ( Spudich and Watt , 1971 ) . Monomers were Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology frontiersin . org 02 Sherer and Courtemanche 10 . 3389 / fcell . 2022 . 974047 separated from oligomers and ﬁ laments via gel ﬁ ltration using Sephacryl S - 300 resin ( GE Healthcare ) in G - buffer ( 2 mM Tris , pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 5 mM DTT , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 ) . Fluorescent actin for experiments with elongating bundles was generated by labeling Cysteine 374 with Oregon Green 488 iodoacetamide ( Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c ) ( Kuhn and Pollard , 2005 ) . A construct encoding the Formin Homology 1 and 2 ( FH1 and FH2 ) domains of the formin Cdc12p ( residues 882 – 1 , 375 ; henceforth referred to as “ Cdc12p ” ) was cloned into the pGEX - 4T - 3 vector and expressed with an N - terminal glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) tag and a C - terminal polyhistidine tag in BL21 - CodonPlus ( DE3 ) - RP cells ( Agilent Technologies ) . Cdc12p puri ﬁ cation was performed as previously described ( Sherer et al . , 2018 ) . Human fascin - 1 was expressed in BL21 ( DE3 ) pLysS cells from a pET21a plasmid that was modi ﬁ ed to encode an N - terminal GST tag and a Tobacco Etch Virus ( TEV ) protease cleavage recognition sequence . Transformants were grown in 1 L of LB broth , induced at OD 600 ~ 0 . 6 with 0 . 5 mM IPTG , and shaken at 16 ° C overnight . To purify fascin , resuspended cell pellets were sonicated in lysis buffer ( 50 mM Tris , pH 8 . 0 , 500 mM NaCl , 1 mM DTT ) and centrifuged ( ~ 31 , 000 x g , 4 ° C ) for 40 min to isolate soluble cell components . The lysate was incubated with glutathione agarose resin ( pH 8 . 0 ) for 1 hour with rotation at 4 ° C and transferred into a glass column . The resin was washed with low - salt buffer ( 50 mM Tris , pH 8 . 0 , 100 mM NaCl , 1 mM DTT ) , and the protein was eluted with 100 mM GSH ( pH 8 . 0 ) in low - salt buffer . The eluted protein was incubated with ~ 2 – 5 µM maltose - binding protein ( MBP ) - tagged TEV protease at 4 ° C overnight to remove the GST tag . The protein was dialyzed into low - salt buffer , followed by a 1 - h incubation with glutathione agarose resin to remove the cleaved GST tag . After collecting the ﬂ owthrough , the TEV protease was removed by applying the sample to an amylose column and collecting the ﬂ owthrough . Pure protein samples were concentrated using 30 , 000 molecular - weight cutoff spin columns ( MilliporeSigma ) , dialyzed into KMEI buffer ( 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 10 mM imidazole , pH 7 . 0 ) , ﬂ ash - frozen , and stored at - 80 ° C . The extinction coef ﬁ cient used to calculate fascin concentration was 68 , 465 M − 1 cm − 1 . Co - sedimentation assays Ca 2 + - actin monomers were converted to Mg 2 + - actin via the addition of 0 . 05 mM MgCl 2 and 0 . 2 mM EGTA . Samples containing 15 μ M Mg 2 + - actin monomers were polymerized in KMEI buffer for 45 min at 22 ° C in the presence or absence of 250 nM Cdc12p to generate short and long ﬁ laments , respectively . Polymerized samples were diluted to 2 µM actin and incubated with a range of fascin concentrations for 1 h at 22 ° C . Samples were centrifuged for 30 min at 10 , 000 x g ( long ﬁ laments ) or 20 , 000 x g ( short ﬁ laments ) . Supernatants and pellets were separated and analyzed via SDS - PAGE . Gel band densities were quanti ﬁ ed using ImageJ and normalized by molecular weight . The intensity of the fascin band in the pelleted fraction was divided by the intensity of the actin band in the pelleted ( i . e . , bundled ) fraction for each reaction and plotted as a function of the fascin concentration . Data were ﬁ t with the McGhee - von Hippel equation ( McGhee and von Hippel , 1974 ; De La Cruz , 2005 ; Andrianantoandro and Pollard , 2006 ) as follows : y (cid:1) 0 . 5 p (cid:1) 1 + − 1 + K a x ω (cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3) 1 + K a x ( 4 + ω ( − 2 + K a x ω ) ) (cid:4) (cid:5) ( 1 ) where y is the binding density of fascin on actin bundles , K a is the association constant , x is the concentration of fascin , and ω is the cooperativity parameter . Dissociation ( K d = 1 / K a ) and cooperativity constants were measured using the ﬁ ts from at least three independent experiments . Co - sedimentation assays with phalloidin - or Cdc12p - bound long actin ﬁ laments were performed as described above , except that ﬁ laments polymerized in reactions containing 15 μ M Mg 2 + - actin monomers were diluted to a concentration of 2 µM actin and incubated with either 2 µM FITC - phalloidin or 100 nM Cdc12p for 20 min at 22 ° C prior to the introduction of fascin . Bundling assays Samples containing 2 μ M Mg 2 + - actin monomers were polymerized in KMEI buffer for 1 h at 22 ° C in the absence or presence of 85 nM Cdc12p to generate long or short ﬁ laments . Following polymerization , actin ﬁ laments were incubated with 4 µM FITC - phalloidin for 20 min . Samples were diluted to 10 nM actin ( long ﬁ laments ) or 2 nM actin ( short ﬁ laments ) in microscopy buffer ( 10 mM imidazole , pH 7 . 0 , 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 50 mM DTT , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 15 mM glucose , 20 μ g / ml catalase , 100 μ g / ml glucose oxidase , 0 . 5 % ( w / v ) methylcellulose ( 4 , 000 cP at 2 % ) ) . These dilutions yield identical concentrations of ﬁ laments for samples containing short and long ﬁ laments . Samples were transferred to imaging surfaces that were constructed by placing Scotch tape ( 3M ) around the perimeter of a 4 . 5 mm × 4 . 5 mm region of glass coverslips ( # 1 . 5 , 22 mm × 50 mm ) as described previously ( Zweifel et al . , 2021 ) . After collecting baseline images of the samples , fascin was introduced to initiate bundling . Reactions were visualized at 10 – 30 s intervals for 20 – 60 min by through - objective total internal re ﬂ ection ﬂ uorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy on an Olympus Ti83 motorized microscope equipped with a CellTIRF system using a 60x , 1 . 49 NA objective and a 488 - nm laser . Images were acquired using a Hamamatsu C9100 - 23B ImagEM X2 EMCCD camera and CellSens Dimension software ( Olympus ) . For assays with elongating bundles , short ﬁ laments were generated by polymerizing 2 μ M Mg 2 + - ATP - actin with 85 nM Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology frontiersin . org 03 Sherer and Courtemanche 10 . 3389 / fcell . 2022 . 974047 Cdc12p for 1 h at 22 ° C and labeled with an equimolar concentration of FITC - phalloidin for 20 min . Samples were diluted to a concentration of 0 . 25 µM actin and incubated with 1 µM fascin for 30 min to generate bundles . Bundles were diluted to concentrations corresponding to 5 nM actin in microscopy buffer containing 10 µM S . pombe pro ﬁ lin , 1 µM fascin , and 0 . 75 or 1 . 5 μ M Mg 2 + - actin monomers ( 5 % Oregon Green - labeled ) . Reactions were visualized by TIRF microscopy . Microscopy image analysis Fluorescence micrographs were analyzed using ImageJ and custom - built MATLAB programs developed in - house . Actin ﬁ laments and bundles were detected from background - subtracted and noise - ﬁ ltered micrographs using MATLAB ’ s global or adaptive thresholding algorithms . To quantify ﬁ lament lengths , actin ﬁ laments were skeletonized using MATLAB ’ s bwskel function and overlapping ﬁ laments were identi ﬁ ed and resolved with user input prior to length quanti ﬁ cation . Filament lengths were quanti ﬁ ed for three independent replicates using at least ﬁ ve ﬁ elds of view per replicate . Single exponential ﬁ ts were applied to ﬁ lament length distributions . For each exponential distribution , the fraction of ﬁ laments ( f i ) with length l was determined by the following relation : f i (cid:1) λ e ( − λ l i ) ( 2 ) where the mean length is 1 / λ and the variance ( l i ) is 1 / λ 2 . Bundles were identi ﬁ ed computationally by setting a threshold ﬂ uorescence intensity corresponding to the signal produced by two overlapping ﬁ laments . Accurate bundle detection was con ﬁ rmed visually . Bundling was quanti ﬁ ed using the following equation : Fraction Bundled (cid:1) F Bundled F Total ( 3 ) where F bundled is the sum of the individual pixel ﬂ uorescence intensities above the set bundle threshold and F total is the sum of all pixel intensities within skeletonized objects . This metric accounts for the incorporation of additional ﬁ laments into preexisting bundles as reactions progress and any variability in the total ﬁ lamentous actin present across samples . The average background ﬂ uorescence was subtracted from all ﬂ uorescence measurements to enable accurate comparisons across samples . To account for photobleaching , bundle intensity thresholds were adjusted using changes in the ﬂ uorescence intensityofsingle ﬁ lamentsovertime . Timecoursesofbundlingwere ﬁ t using the following single ( 2 ) or double ( 3 ) exponential equations : Fraction Bundled (cid:1) Ae − bt + c ( 4 ) Fraction Bundled (cid:1) A 1 e − b 1 t + A 2 e − b 2 t + c ( 5 ) where A represents the amplitude , b is the bundling rate , and c is the offset . For samples that did not attain equilibrium during the observation period , curve ﬁ ts were constrained using the average amplitude of reactions with equivalent fascin concentrations . Bundling reactions were performed in triplicate with up to three 80 μ m × 80 µm imaging ﬁ elds analyzed per experiment . Results Actin polymerization and bundling are dynamic reactions that take place simultaneously during the assembly of higher - order actin structures ( Mallavarapu and Mitchison , 1999 ; Vavylonis et al . , 2006 ; Tang et al . , 2015 ) . As a result , monitoring the progress of each reaction is complicated by contributions from the other . To investigate the effects of ﬁ lament elongation on the mechanism of fascin - mediated bundling , we sought to simplify our reactions by systematically controlling the progress of the elongation reaction . To do so , we used a formin to assemble populations of actin ﬁ laments with de ﬁ ned lengths . We used these preassembled ﬁ laments to represent progressive stages of elongation , with longer ﬁ laments representing later time points . We selected the ﬁ ssion yeast formin Cdc12p as a representative formin for our assays because it decreases the ﬁ lament elongation rate by 99 % in the absence of pro ﬁ lin ( Kovar et al . , 2003 , 2006 ) . The extremely slow elongation of ﬁ laments bound by Cdc12p enables us to directly control ﬁ lament length by modulating the concentrations of actin and formin ( Zweifel et al . , 2021 ) . Importantly , unlike the mammalian formins FHOD1 and mDia2 , which also possess slow elongation activities , and Daam1 and FMNL2 , which polymerize actin ﬁ laments that are incorporated into protrusive structures ( Harris et al . , 2006 ; Esue et al . , 2008 ; Jaiswal et al . , 2013 ; Schönichen et al . , 2013 ) , Cdc12p does not bundle or bind along the lengths of actin ﬁ laments when present at concentrations exceeding 100 nM ( Scott et al . , 2011 ) . Cdc12p is therefore ideally suited for our assays , which require relatively high formin concentrations to generate short actin ﬁ laments . To assemble ﬁ laments with different lengths , we incubated puri ﬁ ed actin monomers in polymerization conditions in the absence and presence of a construct containing the two major actin polymerization domains of Cdc12p ( i . e . , the FH1 and FH2 domains ) ( Kovar et al . , 2003 ) . Like most formins , Cdc12p nucleates ﬁ laments by encircling and stabilizing dimers and trimers of actin monomers with its dimeric FH2 domain ( Pring et al . , 2003 ; Moseley et al . , 2004 ; Otomo et al . , 2005 ; Lu et al . , 2007 ; Yamashita et al . , 2007 ) . Following nucleation , the FH2 dimer steps onto incoming actin subunits to incorporate them into the ﬁ lament , thus enabling the formin to remain processively bound at the barbed end of the elongating ﬁ lament ( Courtemanche , 2018 ) . Once each polymerization reaction reached equilibrium , we added ﬂ uorescent phalloidin , Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology frontiersin . org 04 Sherer and Courtemanche 10 . 3389 / fcell . 2022 . 974047 imaged the ﬁ laments using total internal re ﬂ ection ﬂ uorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy , and quanti ﬁ ed their lengths . We found that each reaction robustly assembled into ﬁ laments of varying lengths ( Figure 1A ) . The distributions of ﬁ laments lengths are well characterized by single exponential ﬁ ts ( Figure 1B ) , which yield an average ﬁ lament length and a variance ( see Methods ) ( Sept et al . , 1999 ; Zweifel et al . , 2021 ) . In the absence of formin , we measured an average ﬁ lament length of 7 . 0 µm , in agreement with published measurements performed on similar reactions ( Sept et al . , 1999 ; Zweifel et al . , 2021 ) ( Figure 1B , Actin alone ) . Addition of Cdc12p following polymerization does not signi ﬁ cantly alter the average ﬁ lament length ( Figure 1B , Cdc12p - bound ) , con ﬁ rming that formins do not in ﬂ uence the lengths of preassembled actin ﬁ laments . In FIGURE 1 Fascin binds with similar af ﬁ nity to short and long ﬁ laments .

Filaments were labeled with FITC - phalloidin , diluted in imaging buffer and visualized by TIRF microscopy .

( C ) Co - sedimentation assays measuring fascin binding to actin bundles assembled from short and long ﬁ laments . Filaments were assembled in the absence or presence of Cdc12p and incubated with a range of fascin concentrations . Reactions were spun at low - speed ( 10 , 000 x g or 20 , 000 x g for long or short ﬁ laments , respectively ) to pellet bundles and analyzed by SDS - PAGE . The intensity of the fascin band in the pelleted fraction was divided by the intensity of the actin band in the pelleted ( i . e . , bundled ) fraction for each reaction . Lines are ﬁ ts of the McGhee - von Hippel cooperative binding model , which yields a binding af ﬁ nity ( K d ) and cooperativity constant ( ω ) ( McGhee and von Hippel , 1974 ; De La Cruz , 2005 ) . Error bars are the standard error of the mean values obtained from at least three independent replicates . Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology frontiersin . org 05 Sherer and Courtemanche 10 . 3389 / fcell . 2022 . 974047 contrast , inclusion of Cdc12p at the time of initiation of polymerization dramatically increases the number of actin ﬁ laments assembled over the course of the reaction ( Supplementary Figure S1 ) . This increase in ﬁ lament nucleation is matched by a narrower length distribution that is signi ﬁ cantly shifted toward short lengths ( 1 . 3 µm average length ) ( Figure 1B , Cdc12p - assembled ) . Fascin binds with similar af ﬁ nity to short and long actin ﬁ laments Formin binding has been shown to alter the conformation of the subunits at the barbed ends of actin ﬁ laments ( Aydin et al . , 2018 ) . This structural effect propagates at least 200 nm along the length of the ﬁ lament and is proposed to in ﬂ uence the association of other actin - binding proteins , including tropomyosin and co ﬁ lin ( Bugyi et al . , 2006 ; Papp et al . , 2006 ; Skau et al . , 2009 ; Johnson et al . , 2014 ; Mizuno et al . , 2018 ) . To determine if binding of Cdc12p to the barbed ends of actin ﬁ laments alters fascin ’ s actin - binding and bundling activities , we performed low - speed co - sedimentation assays with each of our populations of ﬁ laments . We found that saturating concentrations of fascin ef ﬁ ciently bundle actin ﬁ laments that are polymerized both in the absence and presence of formin ( 72 ± 3 % and 73 ± 3 % of the total ﬁ lamentous actin is incorporated into bundles in the absence and presence of formin , respectively ) ( Supplementary Figure S2 ) . As previously reported , fascin binds cooperatively to actin ﬁ laments with free ( i . e . , not formin - bound ) barbed ends with a dissociation constant of 396 ± 36 nM ( Figure 1C , Actin alone ) ( Jansen et al . , 2011 ; Winkelman et al . , 2016 ) . Fascin also binds cooperatively to short and long Cdc12p - bound ﬁ laments with similar af ﬁ nities ( K d = 431 ± 43 nM and 303 ± 110 nM ) , indicating that Cdc12p does not alter fascin ’ s equilibrium actin - binding or bundling activities ( Figure 1C , Cdc12p - assembled , Cdc12p - bound ) . Binding of phalloidin to actin ﬁ laments also does not alter fascin ’ s binding af ﬁ nity ( Supplementary Figure S3 ) . Fascin bundles short and long ﬁ laments cooperatively Fascin ’ s cooperative interactions with actin ﬁ laments indicate that an initial binding event increases the probability of subsequent fascin binding at a neighboring site . This is consistent with the observation that fascin - mediated bundling causes ﬁ laments to “ zipper ” together as binding propagates along the lengths of ﬁ laments ( Breitsprecher et al . , 2011 ) . To determine how ﬁ lament length in ﬂ uences this cooperative binding process , we visualized fascin - mediated bundling in real - time using TIRF microscopy . Because Cdc12p does not alter fascin ’ s af ﬁ nity for actin ﬁ laments , we omitted Cdc12p from reactions containing long ﬁ laments . The absence of formin in these samples enables ﬁ lament annealing during sample preparation , which helps to maintain consistent ﬁ lament length and maximizes differences among samples containing short and long ﬁ laments . To mimic a single population of actin ﬁ laments at distinct stages of elongation , we used equal concentrations of short and long ﬁ laments in our reactions . Fascin - mediated bundling requires an initial alignment of two ﬁ laments into a parallel orientation and at an inter - ﬁ lament distance that promotes stable binding of fascin ( Courson and Rock , 2010 ) . By observing individual bundling events , we found that alignment often occurs along short stretches of ﬁ laments that encounter one another at an angle ( Figures 2A , B ) . By measuring the angles at which ﬁ laments encounter one another prior to bundle formation , we found that short ﬁ laments must be aligned in a nearly parallel orientation to promote bundling ( Figure 2C ; average angle of alignment of 14 . 4 ° ) . In contrast , we observed a much larger variation in the relative orientation of long ﬁ laments that undergo bundling ( Figure 2D ; average angle of alignment of 65 . 5 ° ) , consistent with a length - dependent increase in ﬁ lament ﬂ exibility . Following ﬁ lament alignment , fascin - mediated bundling produces a quanti ﬁ able increase in the ﬂ uorescence signal along the lengths of actin ﬁ laments ( Figure 2A ) ( Breitsprecher et al . , 2011 ) . As each reaction progresses , changes in ﬂ uorescence intensity occur along the lengths of crosslinked ﬁ laments until bundling is complete and sequential micrographs reveal no further changes . At equilibrium , bundles assembled from both short and long ﬁ laments contain a mixture of crosslinked regions consisting of multiple overlapping ﬁ laments , and regions corresponding to stretches of single ﬁ laments that contain no crosslinks ( Figure 2F , left panels ) . Bundles also exhibit variable curvature along their lengths . To assay for length - dependent differences in curvature , we measured bundle tortuosity by dividing the contour length of each bundle by its end - to - end distance ( Figure 2E ) . We found that bundles of short ﬁ laments exhibit less tortuosity , and are therefore straighter , than bundles of long ﬁ laments . To quantify crosslinking along the lengths of actin bundles , we employed a computational analysis tool developed in - house that uses ﬂ uorescence intensity to detect single and overlapping stretches of actin ﬁ laments ( see Methods ) ( Figure 2F , right panels ) . We determined that crosslinked regions comprise ~ 70 % of the total length of actin bundles at equilibrium ( Figure 2G ) . This structural feature is insensitive to both ﬁ lament length and fascin concentration , suggesting that this is a general property of actin bundles assembled by fascin and may correspond to the minimum overlap necessary to resist ﬁ lament separation and bundle disassembly via diffusional forces .

For both populations , we observed a delay between the addition of fascin and the onset of bundling . The length of this delay decreases as the fascin concentration increases , until FIGURE 2 Fascin bundles short and long ﬁ laments cooperatively .

This indicates that the initiation of bundling depends on the rate at which fascin binds actin . Increasing the concentration of actin also decreases the length of the delay , consistent with a dependence on the rate of diffusional encounters between ﬁ laments ( Supplemental Figure S4 ) . Despite the dependence on actin concentration , the delay is insensitive to ﬁ lament length , except at the lowest sampled fascin concentration , suggesting that ﬁ lament length does not in ﬂ uence the rate at which fascin binding is initiated . Following the initial delay , the fraction of actin that is bundled increases over time until a plateau is reached ( Figure 3B ) . Bundling pro ﬁ les collected at fascin concentrations up to 500 nM ( which corresponds to ~ 60 % saturation of the available binding sites ) are well described by single exponential functions , independent of ﬁ lament length ( Figure 4A ) . This is consistent with a single kinetic bundling phase at these concentrations of fascin . The rate constants generated by ﬁ ts to the data reveal that reactions containing short ﬁ laments are bundled more slowly than reactions containing long ﬁ laments ( Figure 4B ) .

Despite the increased variability observed in reactions containing long ﬁ laments , the differences between the bundling rates for short and long ﬁ laments are statistically signi ﬁ cant across all fascin concentrations ( Welch ’ s t - test ; p < 0 . 03 ) , except for the lowest sampled concentration . At concentrations exceeding 500 nM fascin , bundling of short ﬁ laments remains well described by a single exponential function ( Figure 4C ) . However , ﬁ tting bundling pro ﬁ les for long ﬁ laments requires a double exponential function , revealing the emergence of a second kinetic bundling phase .

An increase in ﬁ lament length promotes bundle expansion Bulk bundling reactions contain numerous ﬁ laments that progress through bundle assembly at different times ( Figure 3A ; Supplementary Movies S1 , 2 ) . This asynchrony can lead to temporal overlap of otherwise discrete bundling phases , complicating their resolution . To determine the origin of the two bundling phases in our reactions with long ﬁ laments , we therefore examined the different types of bundling events that take place in the presence of a saturating concentration of fascin ( i . e . , 1 , 400 nM fascin ) . We ﬁ rst quanti ﬁ ed the rate of de novo bundle formation in our reactions . Formation of new bundles involves the crosslinking of two individual ﬁ laments together and excludes bundle “ expansion ” events , in which pre - existing bundles incorporate additional ﬁ laments . Consistent with our bulk bundling measurements ( Figure 3B ) , we found that the number of new bundles increases over the course of the reaction ( Figure 4D ) . Fitting the data with single exponential functions reveals that new bundle formation is slower for short ﬁ laments than for long ﬁ laments ( 0 . 002 s − 1 and 0 . 003 s − 1 , respectively ) . The assembly of new bundles in reactions containing long ﬁ laments is completed within ~ 1 , 200 s . At this time point , ~ 60 % of the ﬁ lamentous actin has been incorporated into bundles , which corresponds to 85 % of the total amplitude of the bundling reaction ( Figure 4C , Long ﬁ laments ) . This suggests that the formation of new bundles dominates the ﬁ rst phase of bundle assembly . In reactions containing 1 , 400 nM fascin , bundling of long ﬁ laments continues after the assembly of new bundles is complete ( Figure 4C , Long ﬁ laments ) . To determine the mechanism driving this continuation of the bundling reaction , we compared micrographs collected at various time points over the course of the ﬁ rst and second exponential phases ( Figure 5A ) . We found that bundling that occurs early in the ﬁ rst phase ( ~ 500 s ) is characterized by the formation of new bundles . These early bundles tend to have linear morphologies ( de ﬁ ned by the presence of two bundle ends ) and a single continuous crosslinked region . Toward the end of the ﬁ rst phase ( ~ 900 s ) , most of the single actin ﬁ laments have been incorporated into bundles . In contrast , bundles observed during the second phase often contain more than two ﬁ laments , multiple crosslinked regions , and branched morphologies ( de ﬁ ned by the presence of more than two bundle ends ) , suggesting that discrete bundles become interconnected by merging together during the second phase ( Figure 5A , arrows , asterisks ) . When individual ﬁ laments become crosslinked into bundles , the number of discrete ﬁ lamentous structures contained in the reaction decreases . This number further decreases as bundles expand by incorporating additional ﬁ laments or coalesce with other preassembled bundles ( Figure 5B ) . To assess the contributions of bundle expansion to the kinetics of bulk bundling reactions , we measured the number of ﬁ lamentous structures ( i . e . , the sum of the individual actin ﬁ laments and ﬁ lament bundles ) present in our reactions as bundling progresses . In reactions that undergo bundling in a single kinetic phase , we found that the number of ﬁ lamentous structures decreases as the reaction proceeds and reaches a plateau at approximately 60 % of the initial number of structures ( Figure 5C ) . The magnitude of this change is similar in samples containing short and long ﬁ laments , indicating that , at equilibrium , each ﬁ lamentous structure contains approximately two ﬁ laments . This is consistent with the absence of a distinct bundle expansion phase . In the presence of 1 , 400 nM fascin , the number of ﬁ lamentous structures observed in reactions containing short and long ﬁ laments decreases at similar rates and with the same magnitude until the end of the ﬁ rst phase ( ~ 1 , 000 s ) ( Figure 5D ) . At longer times , the number of structures remains unchanged for short ﬁ laments but continues to decrease until a plateau is reached at approximately 30 % of the initial number of structures in reactions containing long ﬁ laments . This value indicates that the assembled bundles contain more than two ﬁ laments on average , thus supporting a model for bundle expansion in reactions containing long ﬁ laments . To assess the effects of bundle expansion on the overall morphology of bundled actin networks , we quanti ﬁ ed the number of ﬁ lamentous structures in reactions that have reached equilibrium as a function of the concentration of fascin ( Figure 5E ) . We found that bundling decreases the number of ﬁ lamentous structures by 30 – 50 % in reactions containing short ﬁ laments , corresponding to an average of two or fewer actin ﬁ laments per structure . Reactions containing long ﬁ laments assemble into a similar number of ﬁ lamentous structures at concentrations of fascin below 150 nM . At higher fascin concentrations , long ﬁ laments assemble into a smaller number of structures than do short ﬁ laments . FIGURE 5 structures measured in at least three independent experiments .

These expansion events require the alignment of merging bundles into a nearly parallel orientation ( Figure 5F ; average angle of alignment of 16 . 8 ° ) . As a result , short ﬁ lament bundles retain linear morphologies following expansion . In contrast , bundles of long ﬁ laments can form inter - bundle crosslinks when oriented at a wide range of angles , thereby promoting the assembly of branched bundles ( Figure 5G ; average angle of alignment of 86 . 6 ° ) . Taken together , our results indicate that fascin crosslinks short ﬁ laments into bundles that remain linear and discrete over the course of the reaction , whereas bundles of long ﬁ laments coalesce into interconnected networks with irregular morphologies . Bundles of short ﬁ laments remain discrete while elongating The results of our experiments with short and long actin ﬁ laments suggest that ﬁ lament length plays a central role in regulating bundle assembly by dictating the probability of forming interconnections between bundles . To determine how the length at which ﬁ laments initially become crosslinked impacts the architecture of dynamic actin networks , we investigated whether ﬁ lament elongation can alter the organization of preassembled actin bundles . We introduced actin monomers and fascin into reactions containing bundles of short , Cdc12p - bound ﬁ laments and visualized elongation using TIRF microscopy . To promote Cdc12p - mediated ﬁ lament elongation and inhibit spontaneous ﬁ lament nucleation , we included 10 µM pro ﬁ lin in each reaction . Pro ﬁ lin is a cytoplasmic protein that binds actin monomers and sterically hinders the inter - monomer associations that are necessary for ﬁ lament nucleation ( Pollard and Cooper , 1984 ) . Binding of pro ﬁ lin - actin complexes to polyproline tracts located in formin FH1 domains promotes their delivery to the barbed end , where they are incorporated into the ﬁ lament via stepping of the FH2 domain ( Courtemanche , 2018 ) . Following the addition of actin monomers and pro ﬁ lin , preassembled bundles elongate at only one end ( Figure 6A , arrows ) , re ﬂ ecting the parallel orientation of ﬁ laments bundled by fascin . The growing ends of bundles appear dimmer than the rest of the bundle owing to the lower ﬂ uorescence intensity of ﬁ laments assembled by formins from Oregon green - labeled monomers and pro ﬁ lin ( Sherer et al . , 2018 ) compared to FITC - phalloidin - labeled ﬁ laments . This feature facilitates the identi ﬁ cation of each bundle ’ s barbed end and enables us to track the relative orientation of each bundle over time . Preassembled bundles elongate approximately half as fast as single ﬁ laments in identical polymerization conditions ( Figure 6B ) ( Zweifel and Courtemanche , 2020 ) , consistent with published reports of the inhibitory effects of bundling on polymerization ( Suzuki et al . , 2020 ) . As we observed in reactions containing single ﬁ laments , we found that elongating bundles occasionally establish interconnections with other bundles ( Figure 6A , asterisks ) . Doubling the concentration of actin monomers doubles the elongation rate and decreases the length of the delay between the initiation of bundle elongation and the formation of the ﬁ rst inter - bundle connection by ~ 50 % ( Figures 6B , C ) . Following the formation of the ﬁ rst inter - bundle connection , elongating bundles continue to merge with one another until equilibrium is reached . The rate at which these inter - bundle connections form increases with the ﬁ lament elongation rate ( Supplementary Figure S5A ) . However , many of these connections are transient and break as elongation and crosslinking progress ( Figure 6D ) . These “ unstable ” connections form between elongating bundles that are oriented at a wide range of angles ( Figure 6E , Unstable connections ) . To distinguish transient connections from long - lived binding events that ultimately alter the architecture of the bundled actin network , we classify connections that persist without breaking over the course of our bundling reactions as “ stable ” . Whereas 95 % of the inter - bundle connections that form in reactions containing non - elongating ﬁ laments are stable , only 69 % of the connections formed between elongating preassembled bundles are stable . These long - lived connections are established between elongating bundles that are oriented into a relatively FIGURE 6 indicates p < 0 . 001 ; “ n . s . ” indicates p > 0 . 05 ) .

These angles are more acute , and are therefore closer to a parallel orientation , than those observed during the expansion phase in reactions containing long single ﬁ laments ( Figure 5G ) . As a result , the establishment of stable connections gives rise to networks containing large , straight bundles that exhibit less curvature than bundles formed in reactions containing individual , long ﬁ laments ( Figure 6F ) . The rate at which unstable , transient connections form increases with the ﬁ lament elongation rate ( Supplementary Figure S5B ) . In contrast , the rate at which stable inter - bundle connections form is insensitive to the rate of elongation and matches the rate at which non - elongating , short bundles form inter - bundle connections ( Figure 6G ) . This rate is approximately 60 % slower than the rate at which long ﬁ lament bundles form inter - bundle connections . As a result , reactions containing actin bundles that are preassembled from short ﬁ laments contain a larger number of discrete bundles than doreactionscontaining long ﬁ laments , despite attaining similar ﬁ lament lengths via elongation . Discussion The construction of higher - order actin structures requires the polymerization and crosslinking of actin ﬁ laments into networks with speci ﬁ c architectures ( Blanchoin et al . , 2014 ) . To understand how the process of ﬁ lament elongation regulates the dynamic assembly of polarized actin bundles , we examined the effects of ﬁ lament length on fascin - mediated bundling . We found that ﬁ lament length directly in ﬂ uences both the rate of bundle formation and the likelihood that discrete bundles will expand and merge to form interconnected networks . A model for length - dependent ﬁ lament bundling Based on our quanti ﬁ cations of ﬁ lament bundling reactions , we propose that bundling occurs via two distinct phases ( Figure 7 ) . During the ﬁ rst phase , individual ﬁ laments become crosslinked together to form new bundles . During the second phase , pre - existing bundles expand by incorporating additional ﬁ laments and merging with other bundles . Our data suggest that the bundle formation phase dominates reactions containing either short ﬁ laments or sub - saturating concentrations of fascin ( Figures 4 , 5 ) . The rate of bundle formation increases with ﬁ lament length , suggesting that the rate of ﬁ lament elongation might regulate this process . The limited contribution of bundle expansion to these reactions enables FIGURE 7 Assembly of Crosslinked Actin Structures from Elongating Filaments . Proposed model for the role of ﬁ lament length in the assembly of actin bundles . Elongating actin ﬁ laments and fascin - mediated crosslinks are depicted in magenta and yellow , respectively . Bundling occurs via two phases : bundle formation and bundle expansion . During bundle formation , individual ﬁ laments become crosslinked together to form new bundles . During bundle expansion , pre - existing bundles incorporate additional ﬁ laments and merge with other bundles . Initiation of ﬁ lament bundling early in elongation ( when ﬁ laments are short ) promotes the assembly of topologically discrete bundles ( top ) . Initiation of bundling at later stages of elongation ( when ﬁ laments are longer ) produces interconnected networks with irregular bundle morphologies ( bottom ) . Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology frontiersin . org 14 Sherer and Courtemanche 10 . 3389 / fcell . 2022 . 974047 the formation of discrete bundles that contain few ﬁ laments . In contrast , bundles assembled from long ﬁ laments undergo signi ﬁ cant expansion by incorporating additional ﬁ laments and merging with one another in the presence of fascin concentrations exceeding 250 nM ( corresponding to > 25 % saturation of the available fascin binding sites ) . This process leads to bundle thickening and shifts the architecture of the bundles into an interconnected network . By comparing the number of ﬁ lamentous structures prior to and following bundling , we found that reactions containing long ﬁ laments undergo bundle expansion in the presence of 250 – 500 nM fascin despite the absence of a distinct second kinetic bundling phase . This suggests that bundle formation and expansion progress at similar rates in these reactions , in contrast to the relatively fast rates of bundle formation and slower rates of bundle expansion we observe at saturating fascin concentrations . Taken together , our results highlight an important regulatory role for polymerization - promoting proteins like formins and Ena / VASP proteins ( Pollard , 2016 ) . Whereas ﬁ laments that elongate slowly are likely to become crosslinked while they are still relatively short , ﬁ laments that elongate rapidly are more likely to attain longer lengths before becoming crosslinked . By mediating changes in ﬁ lament length , polymerization - promoting proteins can therefore directly impact both the rate of bundle assembly and the architecture of the resultant bundled network . In addition to the elongation rate , the persistence length of actin ﬁ laments ( 10 µm ( Isambert et al . , 1995 ; McCullough et al . , 2008 ) ) is likely a key determinant of bundling propensity . Whereas short ﬁ laments are relatively straight , long ﬁ laments are more likely to exhibit curvature and thus sample a range of conformations . This increased ﬂ exibility facilitates the alignment of stretches of ﬁ laments into orientations that are compatible for bundling ( Figure 2D ) , thereby speeding bundle formation ( Figure 4B ) . Following initial bundle assembly , incorporation of additional ﬁ laments into pre - existing bundles depends on the probability that two ﬁ lamentous structures will become aligned in an orientation that is compatible for bundling . This probability increases with ﬁ lament length as the range of angles into which ﬁ lamentous structures can be oriented to promote bundling also increases ( Figures 5F , G ) . We found that stretches of single ﬁ laments lacking crosslinks are typically located at bundle ends and comprise approximately 30 % of the total length of each bundle ( Figure 2G ) . As a result , bundles of long ﬁ laments possess longer stretches of single ﬁ laments than bundles of short ﬁ laments . As with bundle formation , the length of these regions likely dictates the probability that they will contact other ﬁ laments or bundles at orientations that are compatible for fascin binding . Thus , longer stretches of single ﬁ laments promote bundle expansion . On the other hand , the presence of short stretches of single ﬁ laments indicates that the barbed ends of the bundled ﬁ laments are in relatively close spatial proximity to one another . This alignment of the ﬁ laments likely imparts uniform structural rigidity along the length of elongating bundles , thus enabling protrusive structures to withstand compression as they deform the plasma membrane and assemble outward from the cell body . Filament length at the onset of bundling in ﬂ uences the architecture of bundled actin networks To determine whether the lengths at which ﬁ laments initially become crosslinked constrains the architecture of dynamically elongating networks , we visualized changes in the morphologies of preassembled bundles of Cdc12p - bound short ﬁ laments under polymerization conditions . We found that bundles elongate unidirectionally and occasionally become crosslinked with neighboring bundles . We determined that the length of time required to establish the ﬁ rst inter - bundle connection is inversely dependent on the elongation rate . Following this initial inter - bundle crosslinking event , subsequent connections form among other elongating bundles . The rate at which these connections are formed also positively correlates with the elongation rate but is slower than the rate measured in reactions containing long single ﬁ laments ( Supplementary Figure S5A ) . Approximately one third of the connections formed between elongating bundles are short - lived and are followed by ﬁ lament breakage at or near the initial site of crosslinking ( Figure 6D ) . Since fascin is an in ﬂ exible crosslinker that assembles rigid bundles ( Claessens et al . , 2006 ; Van Audenhove et al . , 2016 ) , the breakage of these short - lived connections is likely caused by geometric constraints imposed by fascin - mediated crosslinking . Based on our observations , we classi ﬁ ed connections that persist throughout our reactions as “ stable . ” These connections are formed following the alignment of bundles into a narrow range of acute angles , which promotes the retention of bundle linearity following their coalescence . Thus , although ﬁ lament elongation enables the formation of inter - bundle connections , our data suggest that crosslinking early in elongation pre - aligns growing ﬁ laments , setting a template for continued bundle assembly as elongation proceeds . This initial alignment constrains the ﬂ exibility of the bundled ﬁ laments , increases their resistance to large changes in curvature and inhibits their coalescence into interconnected networks with branched morphologies . As a result , preassembled bundles of short ﬁ laments remain straighter following elongation than bundles assembled from long ﬁ laments of the same length ( Figure 6F ) . Physiological implications of a length - dependent mechanism that regulates the architecture of crosslinked actin networks The specialized architectures of higher - order actin structures dictate their rigidity , mechanosensitivity , contractility , and Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology frontiersin . org 15 Sherer and Courtemanche 10 . 3389 / fcell . 2022 . 974047 lifetime ( Reymann et al . , 2012 ; Gressin et al . , 2015 ; Ennomani et al . , 2016 ; Chugh et al . , 2017 ; Stam et al . , 2017 ; Ajeti et al . , 2019 ) . These physical properties enable actin structures to perform speci ﬁ c biological functions and must therefore be tightly regulated . We have found that uncoordinated ﬁ lament elongation and crosslinking can alter the architecture of bundled actin networks assembled by fascin , thus highlighting the importance of ﬁ lament length regulation during the assembly of protrusive actin structures . In cells , a large fraction of the ﬁ laments that are incorporated into bundled actin structures are polymerized by formins ( Schirenbeck et al . , 2005 ; Lizárraga et al . , 2009 ; Mellor , 2010 ; Jaiswal et al . , 2013 ) . Most eukaryotes express at least two formin isoforms , which nucleate and direct the elongation of actin ﬁ laments at a wide range of isoform - speci ﬁ c rates ( Kovar et al . , 2006 ; Schönichen and Geyer , 2010 ; Pruyne , 2016 ) . Our results suggest that the elongation properties of formin isoforms likely play a central role in the precise incorporation of actin ﬁ laments into structures with speci ﬁ c architectures by controlling the rate of change in ﬁ lament length . Similarly , the association rate and structural properties of the crosslinking protein are also determinants of actin network architecture ( Bartles , 2000 ; Winkelman et al . , 2016 ; Svitkina , 2018 ) . For example , ﬂ exible crosslinkers like α - actinin and ﬁ lamin A are less sensitive to the relative alignment and orientations of actin ﬁ laments than are rigid crosslinkers like fascin ( Popowicz et al . , 2006 ; Sjöblom et al . , 2008 ; Courson and Rock , 2010 ) . These crosslinkers may therefore facilitate the formation of a larger number of stable connections among elongating bundles than we observed using fascin . This would enable ﬁ lament elongation to transform disconnected bundles into interlinked networks . Perturbation of the expression levels of regulators of actin ﬁ lament length has been shown to disrupt the assembly and functions of several bundled actin structures in cells . For example , depletion of the formin Dia1 decreases the thickness of the actin cortex in HeLa cells ( Chugh et al . , 2017 ) . In contrast , depletion of capping protein , which binds and inhibits the elongation of actin ﬁ laments , increases actin cortex thickness ( Chugh et al . , 2017 ) . In both cases , cortical actin tension decreases during mitosis , indicating that an optimal cortical network architecture is achieved through crosslinking of ﬁ laments of intermediate lengths . In budding yeast , deletion of the myosin passenger protein Smy1p , which binds and slows polymerization mediated by the formin Bnr1p , results in an increase in actin cable length and curvature ( Chesarone - Cataldo et al . , 2011 ) . Simulations of actin cable assembly have revealed that this phenotype arises from an increase in inter - cable crosslinking that occurs when the rate of ﬁ lament polymerization is abnormally fast ( Tang et al . , 2015 ) . Our results support this model by indicating that the probability that discrete bundles of actin ﬁ laments will assemble into interconnected networks increases with ﬁ lament length . In ﬁ ssion yeast , cytokinetic contractile ring assembly proceeds via a “ search - capture - pull ” mechanism in which formins localize to large protein assemblies called “ nodes ” and polymerize actin ﬁ laments ( Vavylonis et al . , 2008 ) . Myosin II in neighboring nodes binds and pulls on the actin ﬁ laments , leading to the formation of a uniform , contractile actomyosin ring . Disruption of co ﬁ lin - mediated actin ﬁ lament severing produces an abnormal clumping of nodes during cytokinetic ring assembly ( Chen and Pollard , 2011 ) . This phenotype is similar to the defects observed when the number of long - lived inter - ﬁ lament connections is increased in simulations of contractile ring assembly . Thus , ﬁ lament length regulation through severing is required to disassemble improper inter - ﬁ lament crosslinks that otherwise disrupt the architectural integrity of contractile rings . Modulating the expression levels and activities of crosslinkers also leads to anomalies in actin structure formation and function . For example , cells expressing a mutant version of ﬁ mbrin ( Sac6p ) that has a weakened af ﬁ nity for actin ﬁ laments assemble shorter and fewer actin cables in budding yeast despite normal rates of ﬁ lament elongation by formins ( Miao et al . , 2016 ) . This phenotype may arise from a delay in ﬁ mbrin - mediated crosslinking , which would lead to the formation of aberrant inter - ﬁ lament connections and the assembly of meshworks of long actin ﬁ laments rather than the discrete bundles that are characteristic of wildtype actin cables . Similarly , whereas phosphorylation of fascin at serine 39 decreases its bundling activity ( Yamakita et al . , 1996 ; Kliewe et al . , 2017 ) , expression of a fascin variant that cannot be phosphorylated ( S39A ) leads to the hyperaccumulation of actin bundles near the cortex in LLC - PK1 cells ( Adams et al . , 1999 ) . These cells also exhibit reduced spreading on ﬁ bronectin - coated surfaces . Our results support a model in which constitutive activation increases the likelihood that fascin will bind short actin ﬁ laments , thus spatially aligning their barbed ends at an early stage and promoting the assembly of mechanically robust bundles as polymerization continues . RNAi - induced silencing of fascin decreases the number of ﬁ lopodia that are assembled in mouse melanoma cells ( Vignjevic et al . , 2006 ; Jaiswal et al . , 2013 ) . These ﬁ lopodia exhibit a “ wavy ” morphology , suggesting a decrease in their mechanical stiffness ( Vignjevic et al . , 2006 ; Jaiswal et al . , 2013 ) . Similarly , knockdown of fascin in the human melanoma cell line CHL - 1 decreases the number , length , and lifetime of invadopodia and reduces the matrix degradation activity of these protrusions ( Li et al . , 2010 ) . In both cases , limited fascin availability may delay ﬁ lament crosslinking and decrease the stiffness of growing actin bundles , causing ﬁ lament elongation to stall . In this way , disruption of the interdependent kinetics of ﬁ lament elongation and crosslinking during the assembly of ﬁ lopodia and invadopodia may provide a molecular mechanism by which downregulation of fascin expression decreases the probability of Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology frontiersin . org 16 Sherer and Courtemanche 10 . 3389 / fcell . 2022 . 974047 cancer metastasis ( Weaver , 2006 ; Jacquemet et al . , 2015 ) . On the other hand , the high fascin expression levels that are often associated with aggressive metastatic cancers ( Hashimoto et al . , 2005 ) may guarantee ﬁ lament crosslinking early in elongation , thus promoting the robust assembly of invasive actin protrusions .
