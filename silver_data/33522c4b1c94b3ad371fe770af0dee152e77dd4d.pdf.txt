Tang Department of Cell and Developmental Biology , University of Illinois , Urbana - Champaign , IL , 61801 , USA Abstract The epithelial lateral membrane plays a central role in the integration of intercellular signals and , by doing so , is a principal determinant in the emerging properties of epithelial tissues . Mechanical force , when applied to the lateral cell – cell interface , can modulate the strength of adhesion and influence intercellular dynamics . Yet the relationship between mechanical force and epithelial cell behavior is complex and not completely understood . This commentary aims to provide an investigative look at the usage of cellular forces at the epithelial cell – cell adhesion interface .

Whereas biochemical information is encoded in parameters such as post - translational modifications , biophysical informa - tion is encoded in parameters such as magnitude , frequency , and duration . Yet how these biophysical parameters of mechanical force contribute to the regulation of molecular and cellular events is not understood . Despite great efforts from biologists , physicists , and engineers to probe mechanical forces in living cells and tissues 10 – 22 , it remains tremendously difficult to measure the biophysical variables of mechanical forces inside cells . The purpose of this commentary is to explore , in the context of cell – cell interactions , the properties and usages of mechanical forces that can support cellular and molecular work 23 – 26 . At the epithelial cell – cell adhesion interface , mechanical force is powered predominantly by actin dynamics and their associated molecular motors , including ( a ) protrusive force driven by actin polymerization and myosin activities 24 , 27 – 35 ; ( b ) retraction force contributed by cortical actin depolymeri - zation , plasma membrane tension , retrograde actin flow , and myosin activities 36 – 42 ; and ( c ) contraction force provided by actin dynamics and cross - linked actomyosin II activities 43 – 48 . This commentary will not discuss individual adhesion molecules and cytoskeletal regulators , which had been recently reviewed 49 , 50 . The three - dimensional epithelial cell The epithelial cell forms distinct membrane domains by using two sets of adhesion molecules : one set for adhesion to extra - cellular matrix and another set for adhesion between cells . By having two sets of adhesion systems , an epithelial cell estab - lishes structural and spatial organization with ( a ) a lateral mem - brane organized by cell – cell adhesions , ( b ) a basal membrane organized by cell – matrix adhesions , and ( c ) a free surface at the apical membrane . Through interactions with its environment and neighbors , the epithelial cell acquires emergent prop - erties integral to the functions of epithelial tissues , such as coordinated multi - cellular junctional constriction and collective movement 51 – 59 . The three membrane domains of the epithelial cell contain actin nucleation factors , actin cross - linking proteins , and myosin II filaments that create distinct actomyosin II networks ( Figure 1A ) 25 , 60 – 62 . The lateral membrane is further organized into apical , lateral , and basal intercellular interactions with dis - tinct protein compositions , actin dynamics , and contractile properties 63 . Mechanical forces generated at the apical , lateral , and basal actomyosin II cytoskeleton are transmitted to cell – cell contacts via linkage to adhesion proteins or the plasma membrane ( Figure 1B ) . Direction of forces Unlike chemical signaling that is driven by random walks and does not have intrinsic directionality , mechanical force Figure 1 .

The directionality of the mechanical force is heavily influenced by the spatial organization of the actomy - osin II cytoskeleton . Mechanical forces on the lateral adhesion interface are frequently orthogonal or parallel to the cell boundary ( Figure 2A , left panel ) . One exception to this generalization is at folded membranes ( Figure 2A , right panel ) . When protrusions and retractions are formed on the lateral Figure 2 . Direction of forces at the lateral cell – cell adhesion interface . ( A ) Parallel and orthogonal forces are shown at the macroscopic multi - cellular ( left panel ) and mesoscopic cellular ( right panel ) scales . Cell – cell adhesions at the tip of a lateral membrane protrusion experience orthogonal force , whereas cell – cell adhesions at the trunk of the same membrane protrusion experience parallel force ( right panel ) . ( B ) Forces in one , two , and three dimensions can be generated through spatial organization of actin dynamics and actomyosin activities . Orthogonal and parallel one - dimensional forces can be generated with actin filaments arranged orthogonal and parallel to the plasma membrane , respectively ( upper panel ) . Orthogonal and parallel two - and three - dimensional forces can be generated with a cross - linked actin network to support processes on the lateral cell – cell adhesion interface ( lower panel ) .

Consequently , the direction of force exerted on adhesion molecules would be dependent on their relative positions . Cell – cell adhesions formed at the tip of an intercellular membrane protrusion would experience orthogo - nal protrusion – retraction force , whereas cell – cell adhesions found at the trunk of an intercellular membrane protrusion would experience parallel drag force on the plane of the plasma membrane ( Figure 2A , right panel ) . Mechanical force applied in a directional manner could elicit different molecular and cellular events on the cell – cell adhe - sion interface 65 , 66 , 69 . At the microscopic scale ( Figure 2B , upper panel ) , actin dynamics can create one - dimensional ( 1D ) protru - sion and retraction forces orthogonal to the lateral membrane . Anti - parallel myosin II filaments on linear actin filaments can create 1D contraction force . Actin filaments arranged parallel to the membrane would support force generation parallel to the cell – cell interface . Organization of branched actin networks using actin cross - linking proteins would create parallel and orthogonal forces to drive 2D and 3D events ( Figure 2B , lower panel ) . Spatial and temporal control of forces in one , two , and three dimensions can support distinct force - dependent processes on the lateral membrane . Pushing and pulling forces to drive kinetic processes The kinetic energy produced by mechanical forces can be used to create movement , resulting in productive work such as pushing and pulling ( Figure 3 ) 41 , 70 – 76 . Pulling forces can act on adhesions to unfold or disengage a protein by breaking intra - molecular or inter - molecular bonds , effectively changing the energy landscape of the cell – cell adhe - sion interface ( Figure 3A ) 77 – 82 . Weaker interactions can be Figure 3 . Pushing and pulling to drive kinetic processes . ( A ) Pulling on adhesions and membrane can break intra - molecular and inter - molecular bonds , cause movement of adhesions on the membrane , and create undulations on the cell – cell adhesion interface . ( B ) Pushing parallel to the lateral membrane can disengage and disperse adhesions , resulting in mixing of the membrane components . Pushing orthogonal to the lateral membrane can increase cell – cell contact area and time to enhance adhesion engagement .

Thus , the input of different levels of kinetic energy would create different metast - able states of the epithelial cell 83 . For mobile and unanchored adhesions , pulling forces can result in sliding of the adhesion complex . Directional pushing can result in biased movement of the mobile fraction . Pulling orthogonally to the cell – cell inter - face can cause undulations of the lateral membrane , creating intercellular space and increasing the distance between apposing cell – cell adhesion molecules . Pushing the lateral membrane can influence the distribution of protein complexes and membrane dynamics on the cell – cell adhesion interface ( Figure 3B ) 70 , 75 , 84 – 89 . Pushing parallel to the membrane can disperse proteins and lipids , resulting in mixing of adhesion complexes and membrane components . By contrast , pushing orthogonal to the membrane can drive oppos - ing cells together to increase contact time and area for adhesion engagement . In summary , the spatial constraint created by organizing actin dynamics and actomyosin cytoskeleton can determine the magnitude , direction , and dimensionality of force . These biophysical properties of force are recognized by the 3D epi - thelial cells to drive different molecular and cellular events . Importantly , the orientation of the adhesion proteins on the plane of the plasma membrane determines the molecular outcome and ultimately the cellular effect of mechanical force on the cell – cell adhesion interface 90 – 92 . Pushing and pulling forces to drive thermodynamic processes The energy supplied by mechanical forces can be stored as elastic energy to build up tension ( a ) on the plasma membrane ( Figure 4A ) 93 – 96 , ( b ) on cell – cell adhesion molecules ( Figure 4B ) 97 , and ( c ) within the actin cytoskeleton ( Figure 4C ) 98 – 101 . At the mesoscopic level , tension can be coupled and integrated to facilitate processes on the lateral interface 56 , 102 , 103 . Actin dynamics and actomyosin activities can increase mem - brane tension by stretching the membrane ( Figure 4A ) 104 – 106 . Tension generated on the plane of the membrane will decrease undulation 107 – 109 , creating a taut region that supports lateral clustering of adhesion proteins 103 , 110 – 112 . Orthogonal pulling force on the membrane can increase intercellular tension by stretching the extracellular domains of cell – cell adhesion proteins ( Figure 4B ) 113 . Underneath the plasma membrane , tension can be gener - ated in the cortical cytoskeleton ( Figure 4C ) 114 , 115 . Pulling actin increases filament tension and decreases its susceptibil - ity to severing by cofilin ( Figure 4C , left panel ) 116 and results in changes in actin dynamics and filament stability 117 , 118 . Altering filament length and actin stability would affect connectivity of the actomyosin network and force transmission 119 – 122 . Pulling force on actin filaments could alter the spatial organization of the entire actomyosin network , resulting in mesoscopic differences in compressibility , stability , and rigidity ( Figure 4C , middle panel ) 123 – 127 . Plasma membrane and cytoskeletal tension can be coupled to create an integrated membrane – adhesion – cytoskeleton ensem - ble with properties that are more complex than the sum of the individual components ( Figure 4C , right panel ) 56 , 91 , 128 – 137 . Thus , the energy input by pushing and pulling forces to gen - erate tension on the lateral membrane , adhesion proteins , and cortical actin cytoskeleton ultimately results in the emer - gence of new properties and organization at the cell – cell adhesion interface 12 , 138 – 141 . Magnitude of force The reason to consider the magnitude of force is twofold . First , the magnitude of force dictates which process it can perform ( Table 1 , upper panel ) 27 , 40 , 78 , 142 – 148 . Whether the mechanical force is meant to create tension , unfold protein , cause move - ment , or mix components on the membrane would depend on the energy required for the specific process . The magnitude of force can have a differential effect on proteins ; weak force will break weaker bonds and preserve stronger bonds , whereas strong force will break both weak and strong bonds . For exam - ple , unfolding alpha - catenin would require less force than detaching an E - cadherin homophilic bond . Thus , the magnitude of force , along with the intrinsic transition states of the cell – cell adhesion system , dictates the kinetic and thermodynamic pathways for epithelial processes such as adhesion remodeling and strengthening . Second , the magnitude of force dictates which mechanism can supply the force ( Table 1 , lower panel ) 130 , 149 – 152 . Polymerization of a single actin filament supplies less force than a bundle of parallel actin filaments . To generate protrusion , a bundle of actin must polymerize in concert and work together 153 . However , if force is needed only to push an adhesion protein closer to its binding partner on the membrane , a single actin filament may supply enough energy to promote biased diffusion . A myosin pulling on an actin filament produces less force than a bundle of myosin pulling on a bundle of parallel actin filaments . Anti - parallel myosin filaments pulling on parallel bundles of actin filaments produce less force than pulling on a cross - linked network of actin filaments . Thus , epithelial cells control the amount of force available by regulat - ing the spatial distribution of actin dynamics and actomyosin II activities to dictate which molecular process is being executed at the lateral cell – cell adhesion interface 154 . Conclusions Mechanical force plays an important role at the cell – cell adhesion interface . How mechanical force regulates cellular and molecular processes depends on its encoded properties , including directionality and magnitude .

Pushing and pulling to create tension . ( A ) Stretching the membrane increases membrane tension at the mesoscopic lateral membrane level and can enhance intercellular interactions at the microscopic molecular level . ( B ) Pulling orthogonal to the membrane increases intercellular tension on the mesoscopic lateral membrane level and can enhance tension at cell – cell adhesion molecules at the microscopic molecular level . ( C ) Pulling actin filament alters actin dynamics and decreases cofilin severing at the microscopic molecular level ( left panel ) . Changing the length distribution and organization of actin filaments alters cytoskeletal tension , ultimately affecting the compressibility and rigidity of cortical actin associated with the lateral membrane at the mesoscopic lateral membrane level ( middle panel ) . Coupling membrane and cytoskeleton tension to adhesion proteins allows integration of intercellular , membrane , cytoskeletal forces on the lateral cell – cell adhesion interface ( right panel ) .

However , if epithelial cells could encode and tune frequency , duration , and waveform in mechanical forces , it would greatly increase the parameter space , allowing epithelial cells to build complexity . Future development of techniques to measure cell - generated mechanical force will provide formal assessment of these biophysical variables in regulating epithelial cell – cell interactions and tissue behaviors .
