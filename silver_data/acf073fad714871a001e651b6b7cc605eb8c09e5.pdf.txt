After dropping the ball in the chamber with the gel in culture medium , it is first necessary to center the ball in the objective field of view using phase - contrast or brightfield illumination . The illumination should then be changed to epifluorescence ( with the excitation wavelength appro - priate for the embedded florescent beads ) , and the vertical position of the microscope stage should be adjusted so that the topmost bead in the gel , which is also the closest to the center of the field of view ( yellow beads in Figure S1 , panel B ) , is in focus—that vertical position is z 1 . Successful selection of the appropriate bead depends on the density of the beads and the thickness of the layer with beads . The ball should then be removed with a magnet and the vertical position readjusted so that the same bead is again in focus—that vertical position is z 2 . The depth of indentation is then d = z 2 - z 1 . We wrote a procedure in MetaMorph ® software ( Molecular Devices , Sunnyvale , CA , USA ) that allows the manual selection of the appropriate bead , uses the default criterion ( minimum radius of the bead image ) to calculate the vertical position of objective focal plane when the bead is in focus with 100 nm accuracy , and records it in the spreadsheet—the criterion is the same for both z 1 and z 2 , so the focus position measurement errors are the same for z 1 and z 2 and cancel in subtraction , while the measurement uncertainties in z i sum . The total relative error of the measurement of the indentation depth , ε d , is nevertheless always greater than 100 nm because the selection of the bead directly below the ball is subjective . If a bead further away from the middle is selected , its vertical position is also higher ( pink bead in Figure S1 , panel B ) , so the reading will give a lower d , resulting in errone - ously higher stiffness . If a bead is selected because it appears close to the middle but is somewhat below the surface ( white and blue beads in Figure S1 , panel B ) , the reading will give a higher d , resulting in erroneously lower stiffness . Error analysis of the Hertz equation yields an estimate for the inaccuracy of calculation of the elastic modulus E from the measurement of indentation depth d , as ε E = - 3 / 2 ε d , where ε E = δ E / E is the relative error of the modulus , and ε d = δ d / d is the relative error of the indentation depth . � x correct focal plane d = z 1 – z 2 focus 2 r z 1 z 2 A B Figure S1 .
