Antoranz Contera 2 The nanomechanical properties of living cells , such as their surface elastic response and adhesion , have important roles in cellular processes such as morphogenesis 1 , mechano - trans - duction 2 , focal adhesion 3 , motility 4 , 5 , metastasis 6 and drug delivery 7 – 10 . Techniques based on quasi - static atomic force microscopy techniques 11 – 17 can map these properties , but they lack the spatial and temporal resolution that is needed to observe many of the relevant details . Here , we present a dynamic atomic force microscopy 18 – 28 method to map quanti - tatively the nanomechanical properties of live cells with a throughput ( measured in pixels / minute ) that is ∼ 10 – 1 , 000 times higher than that achieved with quasi - static atomic force microscopy techniques . The local properties of a cell are derived from the 0th , 1st and 2nd harmonic components of the Fourier spectrum of the AFM cantilevers interacting with the cell surface . Local stiffness , stiffness gradient and the viscoelastic dissipation of live Escherichia coli bacteria , rat ﬁbro - blasts and human red blood cells were all mapped in buffer sol - utions . Our method is compatible with commercial atomic force microscopes and could be used to analyse mechanical changes in tumours , cells and bioﬁlm formation with sub - 10 nm detail . We began with a study of the harmonic content of atomic force microscope ( AFM ) microcantilever vibration as it interacts with soft living cells in physiological buffers . Cantilever vibration at a drive frequency v dr alone implies a tip – sample interaction force that is linear with respect to the tip’s motion ; sub - and superharmonic tones of v dr , however , suggest nonlinear interaction forces ( Fig . 1a ) . Figure 1b , c presents typical dynamic approach curves acquired using a moderately soft microcantilever ( calibrated stiffness k ¼ 0 . 5 N m 2 1 , acoustic excitation ) and a soft microcantilever ( cali - brated stiffness k ¼ 0 . 065 N m 2 1 , Lorentz force excitation ) as they approach the surface of a live Escherichia coli bacterium ( Fig . 1b ) and a live rat ﬁbroblast cell ( Fig . 1c ) in phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) 1 × ( see Methods ) . It can be clearly seen that as the cantilever tip is pressed down against the cells , the ﬁrst harmonic amplitude A 1 decreases and the zeroth harmonic magnitude A 0 , or mean canti - lever deﬂection , increases rapidly , monotonically and becomes comparable to and often greater than A 1 . In E . coli , the second harmonic amplitude A 2 ≪ A 0 , A 1 and A 2 ﬁrst increases and then decreases as z is decreased , in line with previous observations 13 , 14 . However , for rat ﬁbroblasts and red blood cells A 2 is undetectable . Higher harmonics beyond the second were undetectable for all live cells tested . This is a general trend we observed while using soft ( , 0 . 1 N m 2 1 ) and moderately soft ( , 0 . 6 N m 2 1 ) microcanti - levers on living cells using both acoustic and Lorentz excitation . The zeroth harmonic is the d . c . component of the cantilever vibration signal and is generated due to cycle - averaged tip – sample interaction forces ; this is , in general , different from the quasi - static deﬂection for an unexcited cantilever ( for discussion , see Supplementary Section C ) . As well as the exceptional zeroth harmo - nic signal , a special feature of cantilever dynamics interacting with live cells is seen in Fig . 1b , c , where the z piezo extension or sample indentation required to reduce A 1 sufﬁciently to form an image is in fact much larger than A 0 , A 1 . This observation has major impli - cations for the interpretation of amplitude - modulation ( AM ) AFM data on live cells ; at the imaging setpoint , the tip is not inter - mittently ‘tapping’ the cell as it does on harder surfaces , but rather the tip interacts with the cell over its entire oscillation cycle while maintaining a large net average indentation ( d 0 ) . Therefore , at a speciﬁc imaging amplitude setpoint A 1 ≪ d 0 . The maps of A 0 , A 1 , A 2 and corresponding phases f 1 , f 2 can be acquired easily on live cells in buffer solutions , as shown for E . coli ( Fig . 2 ) , rat ﬁbroblasts ( Fig . 3 ) and human red blood cells ( Fig . 4 ) . It is clear that the strongest , most easily accessible signals that reﬂect local material properties are those of A 0 and f 1 , while the A 2 , f 2 signals are smaller in magnitude on stiffer bacterial cells and below the noise level on softer ﬁbroblast and red blood cells . It can be seen that the A 0 images provide maps of local properties at the resolution of tapping - mode AFM ( sub - 10 nm ) and thus A 0 , f 1 , A 2 and f 2 are the four channels that must convey information about the local material properties of the cells . The strong contrast in A 0 is surprising , because theory 29 would suggest that A 0 be inde - pendent of the local material property . Closer scrutiny reveals that the theory 30 assumes a short contact time , an assumption that is inapplicable to live cells . To understand the physics of image formation we have devel - oped a theory that links the multi - harmonic observables A 0 , A 1 , f 1 , A 2 , f 2 acquired using Lorentz force or magnetic excitation to the local mechanical properties of the cell , as described in detail in Supplementary Section D . Brieﬂy , we ﬁnd that for soft materials such as live cells ( 1 – 1 , 000 kPa ) , ﬁrst harmonic data can be used to extract the linear gradients of the tip – sample interaction forces , that is , stiffness k sample ( N m 2 1 ) and damping c sample ( N s m 2 1 ) , while the ﬁrst and second harmonic data can be combined to extract the second - order force gradient k sample , d ( N m 2 2 ) at each point on the cell . These are effective quantities evaluated at the average tip indentation d 0 ( nm ) into the cell . By combining these with the A 0 maps it becomes possible to map d 0 and the complex elastic modulus of the viscoelastic sample ( E samplestorage and E sampleloss ( Pa ) ) after assuming a contact mechanics model such as the Hertzian contact model . All the extracted maps of local material prop - erties shown in this Letter use the theory that includes the near - surface hydrodynamic corrections described in Supplementary Section D ( equations S15a – d and S18 ) . 1 School of Mechanical Engineering , Purdue University , West Lafayette , Indiana , USA , 2 Department of Physics and Institute of Nanoscience for Medicine , Oxford Martin School , University of Oxford , Oxfordshire , UK , 3 Birck Nanotechnology Center , Purdue University , West Lafayette , Indiana , USA , 4 Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering , West Lafayette , Indiana , USA ; † These authors contributed equally to this work . * e - mail : raman @ purdue . edu LETTERS PUBLISHED ONLINE : 13 NOVEMBER 2011 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / NNANO . 2011 . 186 NATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY | VOL 6 | DECEMBER 2011 | www . nature . com / naturenanotechnology 809 © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

In Figs 2 – 4 , we study the heterogeneities of different kinds of live cells including E . coli , rat tail ﬁbroblasts and human red blood cells in buffer solutions ( see Materials and Methods ) to extract their local mechanical properties using the theory described previously . It is important to note that the extracted property maps are only valid on the cell where the tip oscillation is small compared to the average indentation , allowing the valid use of the Taylor series rep - resentation in the Methods , and not on the substrate where the tip intermittently taps on the sample . Using the zeroth , ﬁrst and second harmonic data we extracted the mechanical properties of E . coli cells , namely k sample and c sample ( refs 27 , 29 ) , and also the second - order force gradient k sample , d , because their deformation is not described by Hertzian contact mechanics but rather by membrane or shell theory . In these experiments we selected bacterial cells with the same size ( lengths 2 . 1 + 0 . 4 m m , widths 0 . 8 + 0 . 1 m m ) from a culture in exponential growth phase . The mapped local stiffnesses ( N m 2 1 ) on the bacterial cell are gen - erally greater than those extracted from quasi - static force – distance curves ( Supplementary Section E ) . Moreover , although the maps of k sample , c sample show subtle variations ( 10 – 20 % changes ) over the top of the bacterial cell , the second - order force gradient k sample , d map is uniformly small ( , 1 × 10 2 11 N m 2 2 ) over the cell and in the region immediately above the cell where the remnants of another bacterial cell are probably present . This indicates a high degree of linearity of the tip – sample force with respect to tip motion on the bacterial cell in comparison to the hard substrate . Small values of k sample , d may also be used as a direct indicator of those regions on the map where the tip – sample nonlinearity is small and the extracted sample properties are reliable . The tip - induced deformation of rat ﬁbroblast cells is reasonably described by Hertzian mechanics , at least for small indentations , and we use equation ( S18 ) ( Supplementary Section D ) to map E samplestorage , E sampleloss . The rat ﬁbroblasts in Figs 3 and 5 , which have the biological function of wound healing , clearly display contrasts in mechanical properties on the nucleus and the cytoskeleton , with the actin ﬁbres clearly visible in the maps . E samplestorage , E sampleloss in these maps ( (cid:3) 30 – 80 kPa ) are generally greater than previous studies ( 1 – 30 kPa ) performed at low strain rates ( Supplementary Table S1 ) . However , other experimental methods that evaluate the rotational stiffness of the membrane have demonstrated substan - tially softer material properties ( 0 . 3 – 1 kPa ) . This suggests that the cells exhibit fundamentally different material properties across hier - archical length scales . Moreover , the differences in elastic modulus between this study and quasi - static force – distance curves suggests that bacteria and ﬁbroblasts exhibit a signiﬁcant viscoelastic depen - dence on excitation frequency or loading rate ( Supplementary Section E ) . ( Statistics and material property maps for additional cells are provided in Supplementary Sections E and F . ) For red blood cells we ﬁnd that the cells are very soft with large tip indentations , leading to a signiﬁcant deviation from Hertzian contact mechanics , so we chose to display the local properties in terms of local stiffness and damping ( k sample and c sample ) . In Fig . 4 , the red blood cell k sample , c sample maps clearly demarcate a stiffer core region ( k sample ≈ 0 . 05 N m 2 1 ) and a signiﬁcantly com - pliant peripheral region ( k sample , 0 . 01 N m 2 1 ) , which is in agree - ment with their function and adaptability to move through the human body . A comparison of the resolution and speed of the proposed method with existing quasi - static techniques is shown in Table 1 . The table clearly shows that the proposed method enables the acqui - sition of mechanical property maps on live cells using commercial AFM systems at 8 – 64 times higher resolution and up to 1 – 75 times faster . Combining the metrics of resolution ( pixels ) and acqui - sition time ( min ) , the imaging throughput ( pixels / min ) of the pro - posed method in mapping local mechanical properties of cells represents (cid:3) 10 – 1 , 000 times improvement compared to existing quasi - static techniques . Furthermore , because the AM – AFM method described herein makes it possible to obtain the mean indentation of the AFM tip , which varies over the sample , the effective modulus is obtained at a given indentation depth . Varying this depth allows one to separate the contributions of the cell wall / membrane , cytoskeleton and focal adhesions .

We have been able to observe the details of changes in the cytoskeleton structure of a live rat ﬁbroblast cell at tapping - mode AFM resolution when imaged at 1 × PBS near - physiological condition at a tempera - ture of 37 8 C . The goal of this study was to observe the time frame within which cells show structural changes . Figure 5 shows two whole rat ﬁbroblast live cells at high resolution at three different pro - gressions of time spaced (cid:3) 15 min apart . In the ﬁrst row , the f 1 and E storage maps clearly show that the two cells are well attached to the surface with a network of actin ﬁlaments . In the second row ( images taken (cid:3) 15 min later ) , the progressive disruption of the ﬁlament network can be seen accompanied by a slight increase in E storage . In the third row , a signiﬁcant increase in E storage can be observed for both cells , and the ﬁlament network of both cells appears more disrupted . Moreover , in the last stage we can see a clear difference in trace and retrace images , implying a greater degree of detachment from the gelatin - coated surface . In conclusion , we have presented a new method using multi - harmonic channels in liquid - environment AM - AFM to obtain quantitative maps and spatial patterns of the local mechanical prop - erties of live cells at (cid:3) 10 – 1 , 000 times better imaging throughput ( pixels / min ) than the standard force – volume method . The com - bined use of the zeroth , ﬁrst and second harmonics of cantilever vibration on live cells in buffer solutions can be used to extract and map the effective values of local nanomechanical properties over the cell . We have demonstrated the method with three comple - tely different cell lines : prokaryotic cells , which lack a nucleus or a distinctive cytoskeleton ( bacteria ) ; non - tissue forming eukaryotic cells ( red blood cells ) ; and wound - healing mammalian eukaryotic cells ( 3T3 cells ) .

Methods Cell culture . E . coli strain DH5 a was used as a model Gram - negative organism . Cell suspensions were prepared by inoculating cells from agar plates into 30 ml lysogeny broth ( LB ) medium and growing them overnight at 37 8 C with shaking ( 120 r . p . m . ) . Cells were freshly inoculated into new 30 ml LB medium until they reached an optical density of 0 . 7 at a wavelength of 595 nm . Cell growth was stopped by harvesting using centrifugation at 3 , 000 rpm for 2 min and washing four times in PBS 1 × , before ﬁnal re - suspension in PBS 1 × pH 7 . 4 . For cell surface immobilization , the cells were re - suspended to an optimal density of 0 . 3 at 595 nm . The bacterial cell sample was prepared by incubating on a polylysine - coated slide for 30 min with PBS 1 × solution at room temperature . Rat ﬁbroblasts ( 3T3 ) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium ( DMEM ) ( Invitrogen ) containing D - glucose ( 1 , 000 mg l 2 1 ) , 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) ( Invitrogen ) , 1 % penicillin - streptomycin ( Invitrogen ) and 0 . 1 % amphotericin B ( Sigma - Aldrich ) and expanded in T - 75ﬂasks foruse in the AFM experiments . The cells were trypsinized with a 0 . 5 % trypsin / ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( EDTA ) solution and the cell suspension placed on polystyrene plasma - treated 60 mm × 15 mm Petri dishes ( BD Falcon ) pre - coated with 0 . 1 % gelatin in water . The 3T3 cells were seeded on the dish 1 – 2 days before the experiment and maintained in an incubator at 37 8 C in a 5 % CO 2 atmosphere . Before dynamic AFM imaging , the cells were rinsed twice with 5 ml PBS ( Invitrogen ) and then 2 ml of PBS was added to simulate near - physiological conditions during imaging . Fresh human red blood cells were obtained from a healthy volunteer from the group and rinsed once with PBS 1 × at pH 7 . 4 to eliminate soluble glycoproteins present in the plasma . The red blood cells were prepared by incubation over a polylysine - coated slide for 30 min with PBS 1 × solution . The cell surface was then gently rinsed with PBS 1 × to remove loosely attached cells . AFM experiments were conducted with PBS 1 × pH 7 . 4 at 37 8 C . AFM imaging and data analysis . All AFM imaging and elastic measurements of living cells were performed with two systems , an MFP - 3D BioAFM located at the University of Oxford and an MFP - 3D BioAFM ( Asylum Research ) mounted on an IX - 71 Olympus inverted optical microscope ( Olympus ) at the Birck Nanotechnology Center at Purdue University . Many different types of soft cantilevers have been used in our experiments , including the Olympus TR / RC400 and Olympus TR / RC 800 in both the acoustic and I - drive Lorentz force excitation modes . In each case , the cantilever stiffness k was calibrated by the thermal noise method . To calibrate the photodiode output sensitivity ( nm V 2 1 ) , static force – displacement curves were ﬁrst acquired on freshly cleaved mica in the PBS buffer solution , and the head was immediately transferred to the actual sample on a lysine - or gelatin - coated substrate , under exactly the same buffer solution .

A sequence of topography and ( A 0 , f 1 ) images scanned in buffer solution using a Lorentz force excited Olympus TR400 cantilever ( see Methods ) reveals the spatiotemporal details of the changes in cytoskeleton structure of two live rat ﬁbroblast cells at high resolution ( 256 × 256 pixels ; image size 60 × 60 m m ) . Corresponding material property maps are also shown . The images clearly show the progression of local mechanical property maps of two rat ﬁbroblast cells over a period of (cid:3) 1 h with 1 × PBS buffer . The extracted property maps are only valid on the cell where the tip oscillation is small compared to the average indentation and not on the substrate where the tip intermittently taps on the sample .

The rat ﬁbroblasts and red blood cells were imaged for a size of 70 m m × 70 m m in 8 – 15 min , whereasthe 5 m m × 5 m m images of the E . coli cells typically took 3 – 5 min to acquire . For all images presented in this Letter , the trace and retrace images of the topography coincided excellently , except for the red blood cells , where both the topography and zeroth harmonic images showed some scanning direction - dependent features due to their extremely low elastic modulus . To acquire the A 0 data , the unﬁltered photodiode output was passed through a low - pass ﬁlter ( cutoff frequency in the range 300 – 500 Hz ) , and the second lock - in to track the second harmonic data was adjusted to an exact multiple of 2 of the drive frequency with a cutoff frequency of 1 kHz . In converting the measured harmonic maps into local material properties using the theory described in Supplementary Section D , the following important steps were considered . First , because the reﬂected spot location on the photodiode can drift between images , it is important to offset the acquired A 0 . In practice , we ﬁnd that offsetting this by a value that allows the measured A 0 to be (cid:3) 0 nm on the hard substrate provides consistent quantitative numbers on the cell . Second , recording the value of f 1far on top of the cell is important in reconstructing the local material properties because the near - surface hydrodynamics changes this value from ( f 1far ¼ 90 degrees ) .
