A schematic overview of multi - body refinement . After a consensus 3D auto - refinement in RELION , the three - dimensional consensus map is split into B separate bodies using user - defined masks . In this example , B ¼ 3 and the letters ’M’ ( orange ) , ’R’ ( green ) and ’C’ ( puple ) each represent a body , and the corresponding spherical masks are shown with transparency . During multi - body refinement , one performs focused refinement for all experimental particle images X i , with local rotational and translational searches around the orientations from the consensus refinement . The yellow crosses in the reference projections for the focused refinements of each body indicate the centre - of - mass of each body’s mask , around which all rotations are made . For each body , partial signal subtraction is performed with projections along the current estimates for the respective orientations of the other B (cid:0) 1 bodies . This leads to B subtracted versions of each experimental particle image during every iteration , which are aligned against projections of the corresponding body . The resulting optimal orientations f * i for each body are used for the partial signal subtraction in the next iteration . Iterative alignment and reconstruction of all three bodiesis is repeated until convergence , which is when resolutions no longer improve and changes in the relative orientations of all bodies become small .

Overlapping body masks . ( A ) Overlapping masks for the example shown in Figure 1 . For the partial signal subtraction for focused refinement of the ’M’ body , the density of the ’R’ body within the ’R’ mask but not within the ’M’ mask will be subtracted , together with the density of the ’C’ body within the ’C’ mask , but not within the ’R’ mask ( left ) . Partial signal subtraction for focused refinement of the ’R’ body comprises the density of the ’M’ body within the ’M’mask that does not overlap with the ’R’ mask and the density of the ’C’ body within the ’C’ mask that does not overlap with the ’R’ mask ( middle ) . Similarly , for focused refinement of the ’C’ body , partial signal subtraction comprises the density of the entire ’M’ body and the density of the ’R’ body within the ’R’ mask that does not overlap with either the ’M’ mask or the ’C’ mask . A total of seven different masked maps needs to be stored in computer memory . ( B ) As in A , but for an example whereall three masks overlap with each other . A total of nine different masked maps needs to be stored in computer memory . DOI : https : / / doi . org / 10 . 7554 / eLife . 36861 . 003 Nakane et al . eLife 2018 ; 7 : e36861 .

Relative body orientations . The density for each body is placed with the centre - of - mass of its mask ( indicated with orange and green dots for the ’M’ body and ’R’ body , respectively ) at the centre of the three - dimensional box , and all rotations are around this centre . Each body rotates relative to a neighbouring body , as defined using the rlnBodyRotateRelativeTo column in the input body STAR file ( Figure 1— source data 1 ) . In this example , the ’M’ body rotates relative to the ’R’ body . The rotation is expressed in Euler angles around an axis perpendicular to the vector between the centre - of - mass of the two bodies to prevent ambiguities in Euler - angle definitions around zero values for the second Euler angle ( tilt ) . The cone illustrates the width at half the maximum value ( FWHM ) of a Gaussian - shaped prior on the rot - tilt tuple . A separate Gaussian - shaped prior exists on the third Euler angle ( psi ) .

The histogram of the amplitudes along the first eigenvector shows a bimodal distribution . The data set was split into two subsets : particle images with the amplitude along the first eigenvector smaller than (cid:0) 14 ( red arrow ) and particle images with that amplitude larger than (cid:0) 14 ( blue arrow ) . ( F ) Refined maps for the two subsets in the same colors . As observed in the movie along the first eigenvector , the SSU rolls with respect to the the LSU and the head swivels with respect to the SSU , cf Video 1 .
