Here we show that the postsynaptic celladhesionmoleculeNeuroligin1regulateskeystepsofpresynaptic maturation . Presynaptic terminals from Neuroligin1 - knockout mice remain structurally and functionally immature with respect to active zone stability and synaptic vesicle pool size , as analyzed in cultured hippocampal neurons . Conversely , overexpression of Neuroligin1 in immatureneurons , thatiswithintheﬁrst5daysafterplating , induced the formation of presynaptic boutons that had hallmarks of mature boutons . In particular , Neuroligin1 enhanced the size of the pool of recycling synaptic vesicles , the rate of synaptic vesicle exocytosis , the fraction of boutons responding to depolarization , as well as the responsiveness of the presynaptic release machinery to phorbol ester stimulation . Moreover , Neuroligin1 induced the formation of active zonesthatremainedstableintheabsenceofF - actin , anotherhallmark of advanced maturation . Acquisition of F - actin independence of the active zone marker Bassoon during culture development or induced via overexpression of Neuroligin1 was activity - dependent . The ex - tracellulardomainofNeuroligin1wassufﬁcienttoinduceassemblyof functional presynaptic terminals , while the intracellular domain was required for terminal maturation . These data show that induction of presynaptic terminal assembly and maturation involve mechanisti - cally distinct actions of Neuroligins , and that Neuroligin1 is essential for presynaptic terminal maturation . active zone (cid:1) Bassoon (cid:1) cytomatrix (cid:1) synapse P resynaptic boutons pass through several stages of structural and functional development before they form a mature presynaptic compartment ( 1 ) . Mature boutons contain an elec - tron - dense matrix of scaffolding proteins called the cytomatrix of active zones ( CAZ ) , which is assembled exclusively at sites of neurotransmitter release and thought to control exocytotic neurotransmitter release from SVs . Key CAZ - proteins are Munc13s , RIMs , CAST / ERC , Piccolo / Aczonin , and Bassoon ( 2 ) . Immature presynaptic boutons differ from mature ones by several characteristics . For example , immature but not mature boutons of cultured hippocampal neurons require F - actin to prevent dispersal of their constituents ( 3 ) . Moreover , the num - ber of SVs per bouton that undergo exocytosis , the rate of exocytosis , and the responsiveness of the exocytotic machinery to stimulation are increased in mature compared with immature neurons ( 4 ) . It is largely unknown how these presynaptic maturation steps are controlled . However , transsynaptic signaling is likely to be involved . Members of the Neuroligin ( Nlgn ) family of postsynaptic trans - membrane proteins are thought to bind presynaptic transmem - brane receptors of the Neurexin family to mediate transsynaptic interactions ( 5 ) . Expression of Nlgns in non - neuronal cells leads to assembly of the presynaptic machinery in cocultured neurons ( 6 ) . Overexpression of Nlgns in neurons increases the number of presynaptic boutons contacting the dendrites of transfected neu - rons ( 5 , 7 – 9 ) . This effect of Nlgns requires neurotransmission ( 10 ) . Moreover , synapse numbers are normal , but synapse function is impaired in mutant mice lacking 1 ( 10 ) or 3 ( 11 ) Nlgn genes , suggesting that Nlgns are critically involved in steps following synapse formation . Neuroligin mutations have been linked to cases of autism ( 9 ) , and silencing of Neuroligin1 ( Nlgn1 ) , an isoform specific for excitatory synapses ( 10 , 12 ) , interferes with long - term potentiation and associative fear memory ( 13 ) , highlighting the importance of Neuroligins for brain function and behavior . Mech - anistically , an essential role for Nlgn1 in regulating postsynaptic NMDA receptor function has emerged ( 10 , 13 ) . Here , we report that Nlgn1 also critically controls key steps of presynaptic bouton maturation . Results Nlgn1 Induces F - Actin Independence of CAZ Proteins . One way of assaying the maturation of presynaptic boutons is to monitor the sensitivity of presynaptic markers to F - actin disrupting drugs . On day 5 in vitro ( DIV5 ) , presynaptic accumulations of the SV - marker Synaptophysin and the CAZ - marker Bassoon are dis - persed upon treatment with the F - actin disrupting drug Latrun - culin A ( LatA ) . After DIV12 , these markers are essentially resistant to LatA - treatment . Acquisition of F - actin indepen - dence can thus serve as a readout for bouton maturation ( 3 ) . We transfected cultured hippocampal neurons with a GFP - tagged version of Nlgn1 ( Nlgn1GFP ) or with GFP alone on DIV2 , treated the cultures with LatA on DIV5 , and immuno - stained for Bassoon . Transfection of Nlgn1GFP caused a 2 . 3 - fold increase of the number of Bassoon puncta on transfected neurons ( Fig . 1 ) , consistent with the well - known effect of Nlgn overexpression on bouton number in older cultures . As expected ( 3 ) , F - actin depolymerization resulted in the loss of nearly all detectable Bassoon puncta in pEGFP - expressing cells ( Fig . 1 and Table 1 ) . By contrast , 79 % of Bassoon puncta on Nlgn1GFP expressing neurons were resistant to LatA - treatment ( Fig . 1 E and Table 1 ) . Similarly , 85 % of Bassoon puncta were resistant to LatA - treatment in untransfected DIV18 cultures ( Table 1 ) . These results indicate that presynaptic boutons formed in im - mature cultures on Nlgn1 overexpressing neurons have features of mature boutons with respect to the LatA - resistance of Bas - soon . In addition , overexpression of Nlgn1 rendered presynaptic Piccolo and RIM1 LatA - resistant , but not Synaptophysin , VAMP2 , VGlut2 , and VGAT ( Table 1 ) , suggesting that this effect of Nlgn1 is specific for the CAZ . The Intracellular Domain of Nlgn1 Is Necessary for Early CAZ Matu - ration . It is well established that Nlgn1 alone , for example , bound to beads or expressed in non - neuronal cells , induces the assembly Author contributions : N . W . and T . D . designed research ; N .

We tested the presynaptic F - actin dependence of such hemisynapses by coculturing Nlgn1GFP - expressing HEK293 cells with DIV5 neurons . LatA - treatment led to a dramatic reduction in the number of Bassoon clusters in Nlgn1 - induced hemisynapses ( Fig . S1 ) , suggesting that to promote F - actin independence in pre - synaptic terminals Nlgn1 requires neuron - specific , postsynaptic interactions . To test this notion , we transfected hippocampal neurons with truncated versions of Nlgn1 on DIV2 followed by LatA - treatment on DIV5 . The constructs NlgnB through NlgnG contain deletions in the intracellular domain of increasing size ( Fig . 2 A ) , but all constructs are properly targeted to the plasma membrane ( 14 ) . Overexpression of all constructs increased the number of incoming terminals ( Fig . 2 B ) . However , only Nlgn1GFP , NlgnA and NlgnB induced F - actin independence of Bassoon , while NlgnC , - F , and - G did not ( Fig . 2 B ) . As NlgnG lacks the intracellular domain , it appears that the extracellular Neurexin - binding domain is sufficient to induce presynaptic terminal assembly , while intracellular portions are required for promoting CAZ - maturation . Nlgn1GFP Promotes the Functional Maturation of Presynaptic Bou - tons . Is the Nlgn1 - induced acquisition of F - actin independence accompanied by advanced functional maturation ? In mature cultures , a larger fraction of boutons responds to a given stimulus than in immature cultures . We stimulated DIV5 neurons using high K (cid:1) - depolarization and identified responsive boutons by measuring the uptake of an antibody directed against the luminal domain of the SV - protein Synaptotagmin1 . This antibody is only taken up where SVs undergo cycles of exo - and endocytosis ( 15 – 17 ) . The total number of boutons was identified by staining for Piccolo . The fraction of boutons undergoing depolarization induced SV recycling was significantly increased by postsynaptic expression of Nlgn1GFP , but not of NlgnG ( Fig . 3 ) . We next tested whether overexpression of Nlgn1 affected syn - aptic transmission . We first looked at the responsiveness of spon - taneous transmission events ( ‘‘minis’’ ) to the phorbol ester PMA , which depends on the maturational stage of presynaptic boutons . In particular , mini frequency is increased by PMA application in DIV15 , but not in DIV5 cultures ( 18 ) . As expected , the frequency of minis recorded from untransfected or GFP expressing cells on DIV5 did not increase in response to PMA application . In contrast , PMA application did increase mini frequency in Nlgn1 ovexpress - ing DIV5 cells ( Fig . 4 A and B ) , indicating advanced functional maturation of presynaptic boutons . To look at the effect of Nlgn1 overexpression on evoked synaptic transmission , we estimated the probability of neuro - transmitter release ( P r ) using the open channel blocker MK801 , which produces a progressive decrease in postsynaptic currents whose time course depends on P r ( 19 ) . We found that NMDA receptor currents could only be recorded reliably in neurons on DIV6 or older . In contrast , after overexpressing Nlgn1 we could reliably record synaptic NMDA currents in DIV5 cultures , suggesting that Nlgn1 overexpression accelerates synaptic mat - uration . When stimulating synapses at 0 . 1 Hz in the presence of MK801 , the EPSC amplitudes decreased progressively ( Fig . 4 C and D ) . In untransfected DIV6 – 8 cultures , the response to the second stimulus was more strongly reduced than the subsequent responses , possibly reflecting a transiently high initial P r , which has been reported for immature synapses in autaptic cultures ( 20 ) . The remaining part of the decay was monoexponential with a (cid:1) of 6 . 16 (cid:2) 0 . 47 stimuli ( n (cid:3) 7 ) . DIV5 cells overexpressing Nlgn1 had an entirely monoexponential decay curve with (cid:1) (cid:3) 2 . 85 (cid:2) 0 . 54 stimuli ( n (cid:3) 6 ; Fig . 4 C – E ) . Thus , overexpression of Nlgn1 in immature cultures has 2 effects : First , cells become capable of evoked NMDA receptor dependent synaptic trans - mission . This might involve enhanced pre - or postsynaptic maturation or both . Second , an overall increase in P r with an apparent loss of an initial high P r component is caused , indicat - ing a presynaptic change . To investigate the roles of Nlgn1 in more detail , we looked at parameters of SV recycling . It has been shown using styryl dyes that both the number of recycling SVs per bouton ( the ‘‘recycling SV pool size’’ ) and the rate of dye release ( reflecting the rate of exocytosis ) increase with the developmental stage of the culture , in particular after DIV5 ( 4 ) . We therefore tested these param - eters ( Fig . 4 F and Fig . S2 ) . Overexpression of Nlgn1GFP , but not of NlgnG , increased the recycling SV pool size to levels of DIV14 boutons ( Fig . 4 F ) . Similarly , Nlgn1GFP enhanced the rate of dye release , while NlgnG had only a mild effect on release kinetics ( Fig . 4 G ) . Thus , Nlgn1GFP increases the number of presynaptic boutons , and induces both structural maturation of the CAZ and the functional maturation of the neurotransmitter release ma - chinery , while an intracellularly truncated Nlgn - construct in - creases bouton number , but does not influence maturation . Overexpression of Nlgn1 also affected the localization of synaptic proteins on DIV5 as analyzed by immunofluorescence ( Fig . S3 ) . Virtually all accumulations of Bassoon or Piccolo , that is , presumably active zones , were positive for Synapsin 1 and Fig . 1 . OverexpressionofNlgn1inducesF - actinindependenceofBassoonin young neurons . Cultured hippocampal neurons were transfected with Nlgn1GFP or pEGFP on DIV2 , treated with Latrunculin A ( LatA ) on DIV5 , and immunostained for Bassoon . Presynaptic clusters of Bassoon are lost upon treatment with LatA ( A and B ) . Overexpression of Nlgn1GFP increases the number of Bassoon puncta along dendrites . These puncta do not disassemble upon LatA treatment ( C and D ) . ( Scale bar , 15 (cid:2) m . ) ( E ) Quantiﬁcation of the number of Bassoon puncta per 30 - (cid:2) m dendrite .

How - ever , Nlgn1 significantly enhanced the immunofluorescence intensity of Synapsin1 and Synaptophysin clusters at these sites , indicating increased recruitment of these presynaptic proteins or of SVs to synapses . Conversely , overexpression of Nlgn1 did not affect the synaptic immunofluorescence intensity of the postsyn - aptic proteins PSD95 and GluR1 , but enhanced the fraction of Bassoon or Piccolo clusters positive for these postsynaptic proteins ( Fig . S3 ) . Nlgn1 Is Necessary for Distinct Aspects of Presynaptic Maturation . To test whether Nlgn1 is necessary for presynaptic maturation , we tested the stage of structural and functional maturation of presynaptic boutons from Nlgn1 knock out ( KO ) mice ( 11 ) . In DIV13 cultures of Nlgn1 KO mice , P r was indistinguishable from that determined in wild - type litter mates ( (cid:1) (cid:3) 5 . 59 (cid:2) 0 . 69 stimuli , n (cid:3) 6 ; s (cid:3) 7 . 18 (cid:2) 1 . 02 stimuli , n (cid:3) 5 , respectively ) , consistent with results from slice cultures where suppression of the Nlgn1 isoform alone did not affect P r ( 21 ) . Likewise , FM4 – 64 destain - ing kinetics were not affected ( Fig . S4 ) . By contrast , both the LatA - resistance of Bassoon and the recycling SV pool size were Fig . 2 .

Interestingly , chronic application of the NMDA receptor blocker AP5 from DIV3 - DIV18 to standard rat cultures pre - vented the developmental acquisition of LatA - resistance of Bassoon , i . e . , had the same effect as knockout of Nlgn1 . AP5 also blocked the aquisition of LatA - resistance of Bassoon in boutons induced by Nlgn1 - overexpression between DIV2 and DIV5 ( Fig . S5 ) . Thus , this form of structural , presynaptic maturation ap - pears to be regulated by Nlgn1 and NMDA - receptor activity . Discussion Nlgns have been implicated in synapse formation , maturation , and function , as well as in cases of autism , but the mechanisms of their action have remained controversial . On the one hand , Nlgns may have a role in synapse formation , as overexpression of Nlgns increases and knock - down of Nlgns decreases the number of synapses in neuronal cultures ( 9 ) . On the other hand , mice lacking Nlgns1 – 3 have a normal number of synapses and Nlgns do have a role in synapse function , as evident from the impairment of synaptic transmission in KO animals ( 10 , 11 ) . Here we specifically tested the hypothesis that Nlgns signal to presynaptic boutons to promote defined steps of presynaptic bouton maturation . We predicted ( a ) that overexpression of Nlgns in immature cultures would enhance the number of functional presynaptic boutons—as well - established for ad - vanced cultures stages—and ( b ) that the developmental charac - teristics of these boutons would resemble those of mature cultures . To set a well - defined time window , we specifically tested presynaptic parameters that are known to remain at an Fig . 4 .

A key finding of our study is that presynaptic boutons formed on Nlgn - overexpressing neurons in immature cultures have features of mature boutons . Control of Presynaptic Maturation by Nlgn1 . Overexpression of Nlgn1 on DIV5 promoted presynaptic maturation in 5 assays : First , LatA - resistance of CAZ - markers was induced . Second , the size of the recycling SV pool was increased to mature levels . Third , the rate of stimulation - induced dye - release from SVs was enhanced . Fourth , the fraction of boutons responding to high K (cid:1) stimulation was increased . Fifth , spontaneous synaptic transmis - sion became responsive to PMA - augmentation . These 5 param - eters have been shown to develop only after DIV5 in untreated cultures and are considered hallmarks of presynaptic maturation ( 3 , 4 , 18 ) . Moreover , on DIV5 , NMDA - receptor responses could only be evoked in Nlgn1 - overexpressing , but not in control neurons . This effect of Nlgn1 could arise from the recruitment of functional NMDA - receptors to synaptic sites , from induction of presynaptic release competence , or both . The Nlgn1 - induced increase in release probability , measured in the MK801 assay , and the increased percentage of functional active zones , deter - mined in the synaptotagmin - uptake assay , are consistent with a presynaptic contribution to this effect . Release probability was enhanced in the overexpression par - adigm , but unaffected in KO cultures . This is consistent with results from acute perturbation experiments on brain slices , which showed that presynaptic release probability is only de - creased upon simultaneous perturbation of 3 Nlgn isoforms , suggesting redundant control of release probability by Neuroli - gins ( 21 ) . In contrast , the LatA - resistance of Bassoon and the recycling SV - pool size were enhanced to mature levels upon overexpression of Nlgn1 on DIV5 , and remained at immature levels in Nlgn1 KO cultures on DIV18 , indicating an essential role of Nlgn1 for these 2 aspects of maturation . This adds an essential function of Nlgn1 in presynaptic maturation to its role in maintaining or regulating postsynaptic NMDA receptor func - tion ( 10 , 13 , 22 , 23 ) . Effects of Nlgn1 on Active Zones and SVs . We show that Nlgn1 is required for the LatA - resistant , that is , F - actin independent anchoring of Bassoon , Piccolo , and Rim1 . The molecular mech - anisms underlying the developmental acquisition of presynaptic LatA - resistance are not known . LatA - resistance could be a corollary of increasing linkage between pre - and postsynaptic scaffolds . In this scenario , Nlgn1 would be essential to establish this level of pre - and postsynaptic anchoring . Alternatively , LatA - resistance could reflect specific interactions within the CAZ induced by Nlgn1 that might have inherent functional consequences . Overexpression of Nlgn1 did not speed up the acquisition of LatA - resistance of synaptic vesicle markers , al - though these markers develop F - actin independence in parallel with Bassoon during normal culture development ( 3 ) . This indicates that during the development of neuronal cultures 2 separate pathways lead to the acquisition of F - actin indepen - dence of SVs and the CAZ , respectively , with CAZ - related maturation being under the control of Nlgn1 . Do we have evidence for functional consequences of this effect of Nlgn1 on the architecture of the CAZ ? Nlgn1 induced the responsiveness of presynaptic boutons to PMA - augmentation . PMA is an analogue of diacylglycerol ( DAG ) which specifically enhances neurotransmitter release from a set of SVs called the readily releasable pool , and this is primarily mediated by PMA / DAG induced recruitment of the CAZ - protein Munc13 to the plasmamembrane ( 24 ) . This allows for 2 conclusions : first , the readily releasable pool of SVs is one of the targets of Nlgn1 . Second , Munc13 , being the primary mediator of the PMA / DAG effect , is a likely effector of the action of Nlgn1 . We propose that the molecular mechanisms that underlie Nlgn1 - induced LatA - resistance of the CAZ might anchor Munc13 in a way that allows its PMA / DAG induced action on SVs to take place . In addition , Nlgn1 appears to regulate other SV pools . Using the high K (cid:1) maximal stimulation protocol for FM - dye uptake and release we found that the total recycling pool size was reduced by 50 % in Nlgn KO cultures . Moreover , Nlgn1 overex - pression leads to increased fluorescence of the SV markers Synapsin and Synaptophysin , consistent with increased recruit - ment of SVs . A developmental increase in the number of reserve pool vesicles has been reported to be a step in presynaptic maturation ( 25 ) , and our data argue for an essential role of Nlgn1 in promoting this event . Distinct Effects of Nlgn1 on Presynaptic Assembly and Maturation . Nlgn1 expressed in non - neuronal cells induces the formation of functional presynaptic boutons in axons contacting transfected cells ( 9 ) . We find here that in such a co - culture assay Nlgn1 does not promote CAZ - maturation , indicating that enhancing bouton maturation requires neuron - specific postsynaptic interaction partners . Using purely neuronal cultures we found that the extracellular domain of Nlgn1 together with its transmembrane region is sufficient to enhance the number of boutons , but intracellular portions are required to induce structural and functional maturation in these boutons . Thus , the positive effects of recombinant Nlgn1 on presynaptic bouton number and bou - ton maturation can be assigned to distinct domains of Nlgn1 and , presumably , distinct molecular mechanisms . Our study is consistent with work performed on cholinergic chick ciliary ganglion neurons , where the Neurexin - binding domain of Nlgn was sufficient to induce recruitment of presyn - aptic proteins to nascent boutons , while the 14 membrane - proximal amino acids of the intracellular domain were needed to align the boutons with receptor clusters and therefore allow for synaptic transmission ( 26 ) . Our study adds 2 important aspects to this notion . First , the extracellular domain of Nlgn1 with its transmembrane anchor is sufficient to generate functional pre - synaptic boutons . Second , an intracellular portion of Nlgn1 significantly longer than 14 amino acids was necessary to pro - mote the structural and functional maturation of these boutons . In our assay , NlgnB ( amino acids 1 – 828 ) was able to , and NlgnC ( amino acids 1 – 809 ) was not able to promote bouton maturation . A candidate binding partner for the maturation - promoting regions could be S - SCAM , a beta - Catenin binding protein which binds amino acids 793 – 828 of Nlgn ( 27 ) . Interestingly , N - Cadherin may contribute to the aquisition of LatA - resistance ( 28 ) , raising the possibility of a functional interaction between Neurexin - Nlgn - based and N - Cadherin - based cell adhesion in presynaptic maturation . Taking together the data from the different model systems , we hypothesize that in neuronal cul - tures Neurexin - binding of Nlgn1 drives the assembly of func - tional yet immature boutons , a membrane - proximal intracellular region of Nlgn1 aligns pre - and postsynaptic terminals , and a more distal region of the intracellular domain of Nlgn1 identified here induces structural and functional bouton maturation . We also find that the developmental acquisition of F - actin independence of Bassoon is activity - dependent , as it is blocked by chronic application of the NMDAR - blocker AP5 . This high - lights that the CAZ undergoes maturation events and that these events respond to activity . AP5 also blocked the action of Nlgn1 - overexpression in promoting F - actin independence of Bassoon in young neurons . Moreover , chronic NMDA receptor blockade and knockout of Nlgn1 each prevented the develop - mental acquisition of F - actin independence of Bassoon to a similar , large degree . This raises the possibility that Nlgn1 and NMDA receptor activity might act in the same pathway of CAZ - maturation . Presynaptic boutons are generated—and must be expected to 13568 (cid:1) www . pnas . org (cid:2) cgi (cid:2) doi (cid:2) 10 . 1073 (cid:2) pnas . 0905819106 Wittenmayer et al . undergo subsequent maturation—during pivotal stages of brain development , including initial wiring of the brain , and after adult neurogenesis , as well as during remodeling of presynaptic input in regions undergoing structural plasticity ( 29 ) . Therefore , it is important to understand the molecular mechanisms and regu - lation of bouton maturation . In addition , isoforms of Nlgn have been implicated in the pathogenesis of autism . Our study pin - points molecular mechanisms of bouton maturation and Nlgn - based signaling that might contribute to such disorders . Methods Brieﬂy , dissociated hippocampal cultures were prepared from E19 Wistar rats or newborn mice as described ( 30 ) and were cultured at a density of 60 , 000 cells / cm 2 on poly - L - lysine - coated coverslips in neurobasal medium supplemented with B27 and glutamine ( Invitrogen ) . Transfection was performed on DIV2 using calcium phosphate ( 30 ) and 5 types of experi - ments were carried out at DIV5 : 1 ) LatrunculinA treatment and immuno - cytochemistry , 2 ) Vesicle labeling with Synaptotagmin1 antibodies , 3 ) Fluorescent imaging with FM dyes , 4 ) Estimation of P r using MK801 , and 5 ) whole cell recordings in the presence of PMA . All protocols are described thoroughly in SI Methods . ACKNOWLEDGMENTS . We thank G . Kra¨mer for excellent technical assis - tance , M . Werner for helpful discussion , C . Dean and J .
