Here , we show that force applied to the nucleus directly drives YAP nuclear translocation by decreasing the mechanical restriction of nuclear pores to molecular transport . Exposure to a stiff envi - ronment leads cells to establish a mechanical connection between the nucleus and the cytoskel - eton , allowing forces exerted through focal adhe - sions to reach the nucleus . Force transmission then leads to nuclear ﬂattening , which stretches nuclear pores , reduces their mechanical resistance to molec - ular transport , and increases YAP nuclear import . The restriction to transport is further regulated by the mechanical stability of the transported protein , which determines both active nuclear transport of YAP and passive transport of small proteins . Our re - sults unveil a mechanosensing mechanism mediated directly by nuclear pores , demonstrated for YAP but with potential general applicability in transcriptional regulation . INTRODUCTION Yes - associated protein ( YAP ) is a mechanosensitive transcrip - tional regulator with a major role in cancer and other diseases ( Moroishi et al . , 2015 ; Plouffe et al . , 2015 ; Zanconato et al . , 2016 ) , development ( Porazinski et al . , 2015 ; Varelas , 2014 ) , and organ size control ( Zhao et al . , 2010 ) . Both biochemical and mechanical cues control YAP’s main regulatory mecha - nism , which is its localization in either the cytoplasm or the nucleus , where it binds to and activates TEAD transcription fac - tors ( Zhao et al . , 2008 ) . At the biochemical level , YAP is regulated by the Hippo signaling pathway , largely through its phosphorylation ( Meng et al . , 2016 ) . At the mechanical level , YAP is regulated by mechanical cues such as extracellular ma - trix ( ECM ) rigidity , strain , shear stress , or adhesive area ( Ara - gona et al . , 2013 ; Benham - Pyle et al . , 2015 ; Calvo et al . , 2013 ; Chaudhuri et al . , 2016 ; Dupont et al . , 2011 ; Elosegui - Ar - tola et al . , 2016 ; Nakajima et al . , 2017 ; Wada et al . , 2011 ) . This mechanical regulation requires cytoskeletal integrity ( Das et al . , 2016 ) and involves different cytoskeletal and adhesive struc - tures : ﬁrst , myosin contractility ( Dupont et al . , 2011 ; Valon et al . , 2017 ) and actin - severing and - capping proteins ( Aragona et al . , 2013 ) , which , respectively , increase and reduce YAP nuclear localization ; and , second , the integrin adaptor protein talin , which unfolds under force and leads to YAP nuclear trans - location ( Elosegui - Artola et al . , 2016 ) . Finally , the Linker of the Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton ( LINC ) complex , the impair - ment of which decreases nuclear YAP concentration ( Driscoll et al . , 2015 ) . Further , this mechanical regulation also depends on nuclear transport , since YAP localizes to the nucleus regard - less of mechanical cues when active nuclear export is blocked ( Dupont et al . , 2011 ) . However , the role of those different molecular elements is unclear , and how mechanical signals regulate YAP remains unknown . RESULTS Mechanical Coupling between the Cytoskeleton and the Nucleus Is Required for YAP Nuclear Translocation Independently of the Hippo Pathway To start exploring how force regulates YAP , we noted that , among the different cytoskeletal structures involved , talin and the LINC complex are particularly relevant for intracellular mechanical connections . Indeed , talin unfolding leads to focal adhesion and stress ﬁber formation ( Elosegui - Artola et al . , 2016 ; Zhang et al . , 2008 ) , whereas the LINC complex Cell 171 , 1397 – 1410 , November 30 , 2017 ª 2017 Elsevier Inc . 1397 1 10 100 N u c / C y t Y A P r a t i o 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 5 3 . 0 3 . 5 ControlTalin2shRNA Phalloidin / Hoechst C o n t r o l + N E S 1 - K A S H C o n t r o l T a l i n 2 s h R N A Phalloidin / Hoechst YAP YAP 5 kPa 29 kPa A B C D E G H I J C o n t r o l T a l i n 2 s h R N A C o n t r o l + E G F P YAP YAP FLAG - YAP - S127A FLAG - YAP - S94A FLAG - YAP Time ( min ) - 40 - 20 0 20 40 60 80 N u c / C y t Y A P r a t i o 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 1 . 2 1 . 4 1 . 6 1 . 8 * * * * N u c / C y t Y A P r a t i o 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 1 . 2 1 . 4 1 . 6 1 . 8 2 . 0 Time ( min ) - 60 - 40 - 20 0 20 40 60 N u c l e a r o r i e n t a t i o n ( º ) 20 40 60 80 100 K F Phalloidin / Hoechst Phalloidin / Hoechst * * * N u c s t r a i n / C e ll s t r a i n 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 * * * * * * N u c / C y t Y A P r a t i o 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 5 3 . 0 3 . 5 * * * - 40 - 20 0 20 40 60 80 N u c l e a r r o t a t i o n s p ee d ( º / s ) 0 . 00 0 . 01 0 . 02 0 . 03 Substrate Young ' s modulus ( kPa ) 0 . 1 1 10 100 N u c / C y t Y A P r a t i o 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 5 3 . 0 3 . 5 Control + NES2 - KASH Control + NES1 - KASH Control + EGFP 5 29 Substrate Young’s modulus ( kPa ) 5 29 Control + NES2 - KASH Control + NES1 - KASH Control + EGFP Substrate Young’s modulus ( kPa ) Substrate Young ' s modulus ( kPa ) 1 10 100 N u c s t r a i n / C e ll s t r a i n 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 ( legend on next page ) 1398 Cell 171 , 1397 – 1410 , November 30 , 2017 mechanically couples the nucleus to stress ﬁbers ( Lombardi et al . , 2011 ) . These observations suggest that talin unfolding and the LINC complex could mechanically couple ECM , focal adhesions , cytoskeleton , and nucleoskeleton , allowing forces to reach the nucleus and directly drive YAP translocation . To test this hypothesis , we evaluated YAP response to ECM rigid - ity . We used talin 1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts , which exhibit a wild - type phenotype due to overexpression of talin ( Roca - Cusachs et al . , 2009 ; Zhang et al . , 2008 ) ( henceforth referred to as control cells ) , and knocked down talin 2 using a short hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) ( Figure S1A ) . We seeded cells on top of polyacrylamide gels of different rigidities coated with ﬁbronectin . In previous work ( Elosegui - Artola et al . , 2016 ) , we showed that actomyosin forces unfold talin only above a rigidity threshold , triggering YAP nuclear translocation . Conﬁrming these previous results , YAP was mainly in the cyto - plasm in control cells seeded on soft substrates , whereas above the rigidity threshold of 5 kPa , the actin cytoskeleton was reinforced with stress ﬁbers , and YAP translocated to the nucleus ( Figures 1A and 1B ) . However , when talin 2 was depleted , cells lacked stress ﬁbers and YAP remained in the cytoplasm ( Figures 1A and 1B ) independently of rigidity . We then determined whether this threshold was related to a me - chanical coupling between the cytoskeleton and the nucleus . To this end , we seeded cells on gels and stretched gels bi - di - rectionally using a previously described stretch device ( Casares et al . , 2015 ; Kosmalska et al . , 2015 ) . We then measured strain ( length increment / original length ) for both nuclei and cells and deﬁned the cell / nucleus mechanical coupling as the ratio between nuclear and cellular strain . In talin 2 - depleted cells , mechanical coupling was low ( close to 0 ) , independently of substrate rigidity . In contrast , the nucleus of control cells was uncoupled on soft substrates but coupled ( close to 1 ) above a rigidity threshold ( Figures 1C and 1D ) . This threshold coin - cided with that observed for YAP translocation , suggesting that YAP translocation was mediated by forces transmitted to the nucleus . To verify this possibility , we blocked the LINC complex by transfecting cells with two dominant - negative plasmids ( EGFP - Nesprin1 - KASH and EGFP - Nesprin2 - KASH ; Figure S1A ) that block the main interaction of the LINC complex , the link between nesprins and sun proteins ( Lombardi et al . , 2011 ; Zhang et al . , 2001 ) . Unlike talin depletion , blocking the LINC complex did not affect cell - substrate traction forces or focal adhesions ( Figures S1B – S1E ) . However , blocking the LINC complex impaired cell / nuclear mechanical coupling ( Figure 1E ) , the translocation of YAP ( Figures 1F and 1G ) and its co - factor TAZ ( Figure S1F ) , and one of the main downstream effects of YAP activity , cell proliferation ( Figure S1G ) . As a control , YAP localization was unaffected after nocodazole treatment to depolymerize microtubules ( Figures S1H and S1I ) , discarding an effect mediated by their reported association to the LINC complex ( Stewart and Burke , 2014 ) . Thus , force transmitted through the LINC complex mediates rigidity - dependent YAP nuclear translocation and downstream effects . To further sup - port this association , we monitored YAP dynamically during cell spreading on a stiff 29 - kPa gel after trypsinization . When control cells transfected with EGFP - YAP ( Figure S1J ) started spreading , we observed that YAP remained mainly in the cyto - plasm , while the nucleus continuously rotated , indicating a loose mechanical link to the actin cytoskeleton and the sub - strate ( quantiﬁcation of nuclear rotation is shown in Figure 1H , and an example appears in Figure 1I ) ( Kim et al . , 2014 ) . How - ever , at a given time point , the rotation of the nucleus dramat - ically slowed down , coinciding with the onset of YAP nuclear translocation ( Figures 1H – 1J ; Movie S1 ) . We then carried out different experiments to assess whether this mechanical effect was mediated by biochemical regulation of the Hippo pathway . First , we transfected cells with the YAP mutants FLAG - YAP S94A , which prevents YAP binding to the transcription factor TEAD and thereby reduces nuclear localiza - tion ( Zhao et al . , 2008 ) , and FLAG - YAP S127A , which has impaired phosphorylation , leading to decreased cytoplasmic retention ( Varelas , 2014 ) ( Figure S1K ) . As expected , FLAG - YAP S94A and FLAG - YAP S127A decreased and increased YAP nu - clear localization on stiff substrates , respectively ( Figure 1K ) . However , the rigidity threshold triggering YAP nuclear transloca - tion remained unaltered and , thus , could not be explained by Figure 1 .

Second , we evaluated the effect of rigid - ity and LINC blockage on the expression levels of YAP and the upstream YAP regulators MST and LATS and on YAP phosphor - ylation ( Figures S1L and S1M ) . No effects of either rigidity or LINC blockage were observed . Finally , we evaluated YAP local - ization after overexpressing LATS and MST , both of which promote YAP phosphorylation and , thereby , promote YAP cyto - plasmic retention ( Piccolo et al . , 2014 ) . As expected , overex - pression of both proteins reduced YAP nuclear localization , but the effect of rigidity was maintained ( Figures S1N and S1O ) . Together , these experiments suggest that forces exerted on ECM adhesions reach the nucleus through the actin cytoskel - eton and the LINC complex , triggering YAP nuclear entry inde - pendently of the Hippo pathway . Force Application to the Nucleus Is Sufﬁcient to Translocate YAP to the Nucleus Next , we sought to determine whether nuclear force drives YAP translocation directly or requires transmission through the cyto - skeleton . To this end , we plated control cells transfected with EGFP - YAP on soft 5 - kPa substrates , at a range where the nucleus and the actin cytoskeleton were uncoupled ( Figure 1C ) . Then , we used atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) to directly apply a constant force of 1 . 5 nN to the cell nucleus , using cantilevers with 20 - m m spherical tips . Force application to the nucleus increased the nuclear / cytosolic YAP ratio , which returned to initial values upon force release ( Figures 2A and 2D ; Movie S2 ) . As a control , nuclear DNA intensity ( assessed with a Hoechst dye ) remained constant during the experiment , showing that nuclear shape changes induced by force did not affect ﬂuores - cence per se ( Figure 2A ) . No differences in YAP ratio were observed when the spherical probe pressed outside the nucleus ( Figures 2B and 2E ; Movie S2 ) . Force - induced YAP nuclear translocation has been proposed to be mediated by actin cyto - skeletal integrity ( Das et al . , 2016 ) , F - actin - severing and - capping proteins ( Aragona et al . , 2013 ) , and talin ( Elosegui - Ar - tola et al . , 2016 ) . To verify the respective roles of these molecular players versus direct nuclear force , we seeded cells on stiff sub - strates and abrogated YAP nuclear localization , focal adhesions , and cytoskeletal force transmission by either depolymerizing actin with 2 m M cytochalasin D ( Figures S2A – S2F ) or depleting talin ( Elosegui - Artola et al . , 2016 ) . As expected , both treatments decreased YAP nuclear localization to the levels observed on soft substrates ( Figures 1A , 1B , and S2A – S2F ) . However , in the case of both cytochalasin D ( Figures 2C and 2F ; Movie S2 ) and talin depletion ( Figures S2G and S2I ; Movie S3 ) , force application to the nucleus with the AFM was sufﬁcient to rescue YAP nuclear localization . Force Application to the Nucleus Also Induces YAP Nuclear Localization in Conﬂuent Cells Next , we asked whether nuclear forces could also regulate YAP localization in a multicellular context , where high cell density in - hibits YAP nuclear translocation ( Aragona et al . , 2013 ; Zhao et al . , 2007a ) . To this end , we micropatterned human mammary MCF10A epithelial cells on a 200 - m m circular pattern . As previ - ously described ( Bergert et al . , 2016 ) , YAP nuclear localization and cell - matrix forces were high at micropattern edges and decreased at the center of the patterns ( Figures 2G – 2J ) . Conse - quently , cells with less nuclear YAP exerted lower forces on the substrate ( Figure 2K ) . Even in this context of strong cell - cell adhesion and low YAP ratios , applying a force with the AFM signiﬁcantly increased YAP ratios ( Figures 2L and 2M ; Movie S4 ) . Importantly , we note that , whereas the response to force was milder than in ﬁbroblasts , this also occurred in isolated MCF10A cells ( Figures S2H and S2I ; Movie S3 ) . Thus , the lower response was due to the different cell type and not the multicel - lular context . These results demonstrate that force application to the nucleus is sufﬁcient to translocate YAP independently of rigidity , focal adhesions , the actin cytoskeleton , and cell - cell adhesion . Importantly , YAP nuclear translocation is not due to the breakage of the nucleo - cytoplasmic barrier under force , as occurs under very high nuclear deformations ( Denais et al . , 2016 ; Raab et al . , 2016 ; Skau et al . , 2016 ) . Indeed , such a breakage would not explain the immediate nuclear export observed upon force release . Rather , force disrupts initial YAP distribution and leads to a new equilibrium that only lasts while force is applied . Therefore , the effects of force application and release may be explained by changes in YAP nuclear import and export kinetics . Force Drives YAP Nuclear Translocation by Increasing Active Nuclear Import To test this hypothesis , we interfered with active nuclear import and export . First , we blocked the function of RAN , a GTPase mediating active nuclear import and export ( Moore , 1998 ) , through a dominant - negative mutant , RAN Q69L ( Kazgan et al . , 2010 ) . Second , we used leptomycin B , which blocks active export from the nucleus by directly binding to exportin1 ( Kudo et al . , 1998 ) . On soft substrates , inhibiting all active transport with RAN Q69L had no effect on YAP nuclear locali - zation , but inhibiting only export increased nuclear YAP ( Fig - ures 3A and 3B ) . This suggests that import and export are normally balanced on soft substrates . On stiff substrates , Ran Q69L decreased nuclear YAP , but leptomycin B had no effect ( Figures 3A and 3B ) . This indicates that import dominates on stiff substrates , either by increasing the import rate or decreasing the export rate . To discriminate between the two options , we carried out ﬂuorescence recovery after photo - bleaching ( FRAP ) experiments to estimate import and export rates on cells transfected with EGFP - YAP ( Figures 3C and 3D ; Movies S5 and S6 ) . To this end , the nucleus or the cyto - plasm was ﬁrst bleached . Then , rates were quantiﬁed as the re - sulting speed of nuclear ﬂuorescence import or export , divided by the fraction of total YAP available for import or export ( respectively , in the cytoplasm or nucleus ) before bleaching ( see STAR Methods ) . As expected , blocking all active transport through RAN Q69L signiﬁcantly reduced both import and export rates , whereas leptomycin B affected mostly export rates ( Figure S3 ) . In control cells , increasing rigidity increased import rates ( Figures 3E and 3G ) . In contrast , differences in export kinetics ( Figure 3F ) were entirely due to the different nuclear concentrations of YAP on soft / stiff substrates , and rates were not affected ( Figure 3H ) . This conﬁrms that substrate rigidity promotes YAP nuclear localization by increasing YAP nuclear import .

( legend continued on next page ) 1402 Cell 171 , 1397 – 1410 , November 30 , 2017 import controls YAP localization , we used the AFM to apply force to the nuclei of cells transfected with Ran Q69L or treated with leptomycin B . As predicted , inhibiting only export with lep - tomycin B did not prevent force - induced YAP nuclear entry . However , since export was inhibited , releasing force did not restore YAP to the cytoplasm ( Figures 3I and 3K ; Movie S7 ) . In contrast , blocking all transport with RAN Q69L prevented YAP response to both force application and release ( Figures 3J and 3K ; Movie S7 ) . Together , these results conﬁrm that increased active nuclear import is responsible for YAP nuclear entry in response to force , either applied directly or by varying rigidity . Force Reduces the Mechanical Restriction to YAP Nuclear Translocation Exerted by Nuclear Pores We then sought to understand how force affects nuclear import and noticed that nuclei on stiff substrates were more ﬂattened than on soft substrates ( Figures 4A and 4B ) . Interestingly , force application with the AFM also leads to nuclear ﬂattening of similar magnitude ( see STAR Methods ) . Nuclear ﬂattening may increase nuclear pore permeability : indeed , the inner lumen of nuclear pores comprises a disorganized ﬂexible meshwork of proteins containing phenylalanine - glycine repeats ( FG nups ) ( Frey and Go¨rlich , 2007 ; Jamali et al . , 2011 ) , which impairs free diffusion ( Frey and Go¨rlich , 2007 ; Patel et al . , 2007 ; Timney et al . , 2016 ) and exerts mechanical resistance ( Bestembayeva et al . , 2015 ) . By deforming and ﬂattening the nucleus , force could both partially open pores ( reducing mechanical restriction to passage ) and increase nuclear membrane curvature . This would increase nuclear pore exposure to the cytosolic versus nuclear side of the membrane , favoring import versus export . To validate this hypothesis and to discriminate ﬂattening from other relevant parameters , we introduced additional perturbations to nuclear shape via hyper - and hypo - osmotic shocks . We found that the YAP ratio correlated much better with nuclear ﬂattening ( Figures 4C and 4D ) than with any other parameter , including the area , volume , aspect ratio , or height of nuclei ; DNA density as as - sessed with a Hoechst dye ; or the ratio between cell and nuclear volume ( Figure S4 ) . Hypo - shocks decreased ﬂattening and YAP ratios at high rigidity , whereas hyper - shocks increased YAP ratios and ﬂattening at low rigidities . To conﬁrm the role of nuclear pore mechanical restriction , we carried out different experiments . First , we measured the size of nuclear pores in cells seeded on soft or stiff substrates with transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) . TEM images conﬁrmed that the apparent size of nuclear pores was larger on stiffer substrates ( Figures 4E and 4F ) . Second , we per - turbed nuclear pore permeability by disrupting FG interactions with trans1 - 2 cyclohexanediol ( CHD ) ( Ribbeck and Go¨rlich , 2002 ) and Pitstop2 ( Liashkovich et al . , 2015 ) . On soft sub - strates , increasing nuclear pore permeability with either drug increased YAP ratios , but the effect decreased with increasing rigidity and became negligible at 150 kPa ( Figures 4G and 4H ) . Finally , we increased the mechanical resistance of YAP to nu - clear pore transport by increasing protein size via the addition of one or two EGFP monomers ( 31 kDa ) to the endogenous protein ( 65 kDa ) . As predicted , adding one EGFP increased the threshold for YAP nuclear entry from 5 to 15 kPa , and add - ing two EGFP monomers moved the threshold above the high - est rigidity tested ( 150 kPa ) ( Figures 4I and 4J ) . Thus , on soft substrates , nuclear pores mechanically restrict YAP import . This restriction is reduced by nuclear force and subsequent ﬂattening on stiff substrates and is increased by molecular weight . Molecular Mechanical Stability Regulates YAP Nuclear Translocation An interesting property of a protein translocation mechanism across a mechanically restricted pore is that transport might be regulated by the protein’s mechanical stability , as molecules that can easily unfold should oppose less resistance . Certainly , mechanical unfolding of molecules crossing nanometer - sized pores occurs during protein degradation , bacterial toxin delivery , and protein trafﬁcking between organelles ( Olivares et al . , 2016 ; Rodriguez - Larrea and Bayley , 2014 ; Sato et al . , 2005 ; Thoren et al . , 2009 ) . Further , proteins with lower mechanical stability , which unfold more easily , have increased translocation ( Berko et al . , 2012 ) . Even though the size of nuclear pores ( 60 nm ; Figure 4E ; Beck et al . , 2004 ) is much larger than those of previ - ously described pores with this feature , the mechanical resis - tance exerted by FG nups may lead to a similar effect . To explore this , we ﬁrst pulled single YAP molecules with an AFM ( Perez - Ji - menez et al . , 2006 ) to measure YAP mechanical stability ( Figure 5A ) . Whereas 41 % of the trajectories exhibited a resis - tance to unfolding of 60 pN , in the majority of the cases , YAP unfolded at undetectable forces ( < 10 pN ) ( Figures 5B and S5A – S5C ) , thus showing that YAP is , per se , a mechanically labile protein . Then , we tagged YAP with different protein frag - ments with molecular weights similar or smaller than those of EGFP but with very well deﬁned mechanical properties . Those are the R16 domain of spectrin , the I27 domain of titin , and the Spy 0128 domain of pilin . R16 and I27 unfold , respectively , at 30 pN ( Randles et al . , 2007 ) and 200 pN ( Carrion - Vazquez et al . , 1999 ) at similar pulling velocities , and Spy0128 does not unfold even when submitted to the highest force that a single - molecule AFM can exert ( (cid:3) 800 pN ) ( Alegre - Cebollada et al . , 2010 ) . Remarkably , the rigidity threshold for translocation pro - gressively increased with mechanical stability ( Figures 5C – 5E ) . To further isolate the effect of mechanical stability , we generated another YAP plasmid tagged with I27 V11P , a less mechanically stable point mutation of I27 ( Li et al . , 2000 ) that unfolds at a much lower force of 143 pN . Conﬁrming our hypothesis , YAP I27 V11P translocated to the nucleus between R16 and I27 YAP - containing proteins ( Figures 5C – 5E ) .

Cell 171 , 1397 – 1410 , November 30 , 2017 1403 differences between the different constructs were largely abol - ished upon disruption of FG nups with CHD , demonstrating that their differences in nuclear localization were mediated by nuclear pores ( Figure S5D ) . Molecular Mechanical Stability and Weight Are General Regulators of Nuclear Transport These results place mechanical stability as a novel mechanism to control the molecular speciﬁcity of nuclear translocation and its regulation by force . Such a mechanism may be of general applicability beyond YAP and not even require active transport . To assess this possibility , we studied the localization of the R16 , I27 V11P , and I27 fragments without YAP . Even in this case , we observed a progressive rigidity threshold for nuclear translocation ( Figures 6A – 6C ) . Due to the small size of the frag - ments ( in the absence of YAP ) , the process was passive rather than active , as the response was not abrogated by RAN Q69L ( Figure S6A ) . This suggests that the increased exposure of nu - clear pores to the cytoplasmic side caused by ﬂattening may be sufﬁcient to promote nuclear import even without active transport . Consistently with this , promoting nuclear import at all rigidities with the addition of a nuclear localization signal ( NLS ) led to strong nuclear localizations regardless of rigidity , both for the fragments and for YAP itself ( Figure S6B ) . Finally , we carried out FRAP experiments to check if this effect of rigidity on the passive nuclear translocation of small proteins was also mediated by nuclear import , as in the case of YAP . To analyze the role of mechanical stability , we used EGFP - I27 ( with high mechanical stability ) and EGFP - R16 ( with lower mechanical stability ) . To compare this to the role of molecular weight , we used EGFP and a construct with two EGFP repeats , 2xEGFP .

See also Figure S4 . 1404 Cell 171 , 1397 – 1410 , November 30 , 2017 we observed that , for all constructs , high rigidity increased import but not export ( Figures 6D – 6G ) . Low mechanical stability also increased import but did not affect export ( Figures 6D and 6E ) . Thus , the main effect of both substrate rigidity and mechanical stability was on import rates ; and , consequently , import rates correlated well with the nuclear / cytosolic ratio of the EGFP - tagged constructs ( Figure S6C ) . In contrast , increasing molecular weight decreased both import and export ( Figures 6F and 6G ) , consistent with impaired overall transport . To further analyze the effect of molecular weight , we measured the progressive nuclear entry of ﬂuorescently labeled dextran molecules of different sizes into the nucleus . Conﬁrming FRAP results , we observed faster nuclear entry on stiffer sub - strates for all molecular weights ( Figures 6H – 6K ) . However , and interestingly , the difference between soft and stiff sub - strates was progressively reduced as molecular weight increased . This shows that , whereas nuclear force facilitates the passive transport of large molecules , the effect is dimin - ished as the size of the molecule increases , thereby establish - ing an optimal protein size for mechanosensitive nuclear transport . In conclusion , both the mechanical stability and the molecular weight of a protein can control nuclear shuttling and localization , independently of biochemical regulation or active transport . DISCUSSION Our results demonstrate that force results in nuclear ﬂattening , leading to increased nuclear import of YAP ( and , potentially , other proteins ) due to decreased mechanical restriction to molecular transport in nuclear pores ( Figure 7 ) . Besides our proposed regulation , we note that additional mechanisms could also be at play . For instance , ion channels at the nuclear membrane may be mechanosensitive ( Ferrera et al . , 2014 ; Substrate Young ' s modulus ( kPa ) 0 . 1 1 10 100 1000 N u c / C y t Y A P r a t i o 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 5 3 . 0 3 . 5 Rigidity threshold ( kPa ) 0 20 40140 160 U n f o l d i n g f o r c e ( p N ) 0 200 800 S u b s t r a t e Y o u n g ’ s m o d u l u s ( k P a ) FLAG - YAP FLAG - YAP - R16 FLAG - YAP - I27 V11P FLAG - YAP - I27 FLAG - YAP - Spy0128 FLAG - YAP FLAG - YAP - R16 FLAG - YAP - I27 V11P 11 15 29 150 FLAG - YAP - I27 FLAG - YAP - Spy0128 A C D E B 50 nm 100 p N L c ~ 155 nm Protein L YAP Protein L Protein L Protein L AFM cantilever Force Figure 5 .

See also Figure S6 . 1406 Cell 171 , 1397 – 1410 , November 30 , 2017 Finan et al . , 2011 ) , nuclear ﬂattening could affect nuclear enve - lope folds , and protein concentration gradients could be affected by variations in nuclear / cell volume ratios induced by force . Whereas we cannot fully discard a potential role of those mechanisms , we note that they cannot explain our data . Indeed , hypo - osmotic shocks ( which increase mem - brane tension and would decrease nuclear folds ) had the opposite effect on YAP localization than force or rigidity , and nuclear / cell volume ratios did not correlate with YAP localiza - tion ( Figure S4 ) . Mechanical stability emerges as a novel regulator of nuclear transport in addition to biochemical regulation and protein size ( Jamali et al . , 2011 ; Timney et al . , 2016 ) . In different types of nanometric pores , recent studies have highlighted the impor - tance of protein unfolding to allow translocation through narrow openings ( Berko et al . , 2012 ; Olivares et al . , 2016 ; Rodriguez - Larrea and Bayley , 2014 ; Sato et al . , 2005 ; Thoren et al . , 2009 ) . In the case of nuclear pores , the forces required for protein unfolding could be mediated by repulsive interactions with FG repeats , which impair molecular diffusion through nuclear pores ( Ribbeck and Go¨rlich , 2002 ) . Supporting this hypothesis , AFM experiments , where nuclear pore channels were penetrated with 2 nm tips ( and , thus , molecule sized ) , led to repulsive forces of the order of 10 1 – 10 2 pN , of the same order of the forces required to unfold the different molecules probed in this study ( Bestembayeva et al . , 2015 ) . Once inside a pore , an unfolded molecule would minimize its interactions with FG repeats by staying in the central part of the pore , thereby facilitating transport . How translocating molecules interact mechanically with nuclear pore channels , and how this is affected by force - induced conformational changes in nuclear pores , remains an open question . However , our results suggest the following picture . Repulsive forces from FG - nups unfold a fraction of the proteins entering nuclear pores . This fraction increases as the mechanical stability ( unfolding force ) of the protein decreases . However , on soft substrates , pores are small enough to impair the transport of proteins , even if they are unfolded ; thus , protein mechanical sta - bility has no effect . Consequently , there is only slow import , and nuclear / cytosolic ratios are low . As rigidity increases , force is transmitted to the nucleus , the nucleus ﬂattens , and pores grad - ually open and expose their cytoplasmic side , allowing unfolded proteins to import faster . Since proteins with lower mechanical stability tend to be more unfolded , their translocation is favored . For very stable proteins ( such as Spy0128 ) , unfolding never occurs ; thus , nuclear localization is low , regardless of substrate rigidity . Our study provides a novel framework to interpret previous ﬁndings . First , we show that talin - mediated mechanosensing allows force transmission to the nucleus only above a threshold in substrate rigidity . Thus , any nuclear mechanosensing mecha - nism can also potentially operate as a rigidity sensor . This includes YAP translocation but also previously described mech - anisms of nuclear sensing of forces transmitted through integrins ( Tajik et al . , 2016 ) or the LINC complex ( Guilluy et al . , 2014 ) . Thus , targeting the mechanical connection between the nucleus and the cytoskeleton ( i . e . , the LINC complex ) emerges as a potential approach to prevent the adverse effects of tissue stiffening in different diseases ( Humphrey et al . , 2014 ; Kumar and Weaver , 2009 ) . Second , our results could explain how nucleoskeletal changes affect YAP localization . For instance , nuclear softening , which can occur in cancer cells ( Cross et al . , 2007 ; Guck et al . , 2005 ) , would promote nuclear ﬂattening in response to force and subsequent YAP nuclear import . Such an effect may be relevant in explaining the role of YAP nuclear translocation in malignant transformation ( Shimomura et al . , 2014 ) . In contrast , overexpression of lamin A leads to a decrease in nuclear YAP ( Swift et al . , 2013 ) . This could be explained by increased nuclear rigidity ( Harada et al . , 2014 ) , which would impair nuclear ﬂattening . Finally , developmental scenarios such as gastrulation ( Behrndt et al . , 2012 ) or in the inner cell mass ( Samarage et al . , 2015 ) involve important cell deformations and shape changes , which likely induce nuclear deformations . This may provide a mechanism to regulate YAP , which is a fundamental driver in developmental processes . More generally , our ﬁndings reveal a novel mechanosensing mechanism directly converting force into nuclear molecular import . Potentially , this mechanism could regulate the nucleocy - toplasmic shuttling of any protein and control speciﬁcity through the mechanical stability of the molecules involved . This may contribute , for instance , to the localization of other mechanosen - sitive transcriptional regulators such as MRTF - A ( Ho et al . , 2013 ; Zhao et al . , 2007b ) or b - catenin ( Ferna´ndez - Sa´nchez et al . , 2015 ; Mouw et al . , 2014 ) . Because it directly regulates transcription , this mechanism may be central to inﬂuence long - term gene expression in response to mechanical cues , placing force trans - mission to the nucleus as a fundamental factor . F F Soft substrate YAP low mech . stability large size A B C Figure 7 . Proposed Model of Mechanosensitive Nucleocytoplasmic Shuttling ( A ) On soft substrates , the nucleus is mechanically uncoupled from the sub - strate and not submitted to forces . Import and export of YAP through nuclear pores is balanced . ( B ) On stiff substrates , focal adhesions and stress ﬁbers form , applying forces to the nucleus and ﬂattening it . This stretches and curves nuclear pores , exposing the cytoplasmic side . This leads to increased YAP import . ( C ) Protein nuclear import depends on molecular weight and mechanical stability : high weight impairs import , and low stability ( easily unfolded protein ) promotes import . This has potential general applicability beyond YAP .

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS Cell lines Talin 1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) male mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts were described previously ( Zhang et al . , 2008 ) and cultured with DMEM 1x ( Life technologies 41965 ) supplemented with 15 % FBS , 1 % Penicilin , 1 % Streptomycin , 1 . 5 % HEPES . Mammary epithelial female MCF10A cells were from ATCC , and grown on DMEM - F12 media supplemented with 5 % Horse Serum , 1 % Penicillin , 1 % Streptomycin , 20 ng / mL EGF , 0 . 5 mg / mL Hydrocortisone , 100 ng / mL Cholera Toxin , and 10 m g / mL Insulin . METHOD DETAILS Preparation of polyacrylamide gels Polyacrylamide gels were prepared as described previously ( Elosegui - Artola et al . , 2014 ; Elosegui - Artola et al . , 2016 ) . Brieﬂy , glass bottom petri dished and slides were activated with a solution of acetic acid , 3 - ( Trimethoxysilyl ) propyl methacrylate ( Sigma ) , and ethanol ( 1 : 1 : 14 ) for 20 min , washed with ethanol three times and air - dried for 10 min . Different concentrations of acrylamide and bis - acrylamide were mixed in a solution to produce gels of different rigidity . The solution contained 2 mg / ml NHS acrylate ( Sigma ) , 0 . 4 % ﬂuorescent far red carboxylated 200 nm beads ( Invitrogen ) , 0 . 5 % ammonium persulfate , and 0 . 05 % tetramethylethylenedi - amine ( TEMED ) . 10 m l of the solution was then placed on top of the glass and covered with a coverslip . After one hour , the coverslip was removed , and the gels were coated with 10 m g / ml ﬁbronectin ( Sigma ) overnight at 4 degrees . After washing gels with PBS , cells were trypsinized and seeded on top of gels . Experiments were carried out 4 – 8 hr after cell seeding . The rigidity of polyacrylamide gels was measured with Atomic Force Microscopy as described previously ( Elosegui - Artola et al . , 2014 ; Elosegui - Artola et al . , 2016 ) . Immunostaining For immunostaining , cells were ﬁxed with 4 % paraformaldehyde for 15 min , washed 3 times with PBS , permeabilized with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 for 5 min , incubated with primary antibodies ( 1h , room temperature ) , and incubated with secondary antibodies Continued REAGENT or RESOURCE SOURCE IDENTIFIER Plasmid : FLAG - YAP - R16 This study N / A Plasmid : FLAG - YAP - I27 This study N / A Plasmid : FLAG - YAP - I27 V11P This study N / A Plasmid : FLAG - YAP - spy0128 This study N / A Plasmid : FLAG - R16 This study N / A Plasmid : FLAG - I27 This study N / A Plasmid : FLAG - I27 V11P This study N / A Plasmid : EGFP - R16 This study N / A Plasmid : EGFP - I27 This study N / A Plasmid : 2xEGFP This study N / A Plasmid : ProteinL 2 - YAP - ProteinL 2 This study N / A Software and Algorithms MATLAB MathWorks , Natick N / A ImageJ NIH , Bethesda N / A Metamorph Imaging Software Molecular Devices , Sunnyvale N / A Andor IQ3 Live Cell Imaging Software ANDOR , Belfast N / A JPK SPM software JPK , Berlin N / A Micro - manager Open Imaging , San Francisco N / A Nuclear rotation algorithm This study N / A Traction force algorithms Bazellie ` res et al . , 2015 N / A Single molecule AFM analysis algorithms Popa et al . , 2013 N / A e2 Cell 171 , 1397 – 1410 . e1 – e6 , November 30 , 2017 ( 1h , room temperature ) . Phalloidin was added with the secondary antibodies , whereas Hoechst was added after secondary antibodies for 10 min . Fluorescence images were taken with a 60x oil immersion objective ( NA = 1 . 40 ) in an inverted microscope ( Nikon Eclipse Ti ) or a spinning disk confocal microscope ( Andor ) . The length of pFAK focal adhesions was assessed as described previously ( Elosegui - Artola et al . , 2016 ) by measuring the length of bright focal adhesions on the edge of single cells . Nuclear / Cytosolic ratio of YAP , FLAG or GFP was assessed by measuring the intensity of a region of the nucleus and a region with equal size in the cytosol immediately adjacent to the nuclear region . The corresponding Hoechst staining image was used to delimit nuclear versus cytosolic regions . In all cases , the localization of overexpressed constructs was assessed by staining for speciﬁc tags of the construct ( GFP or FLAG ) . Primary antibodies used were GFP rabbit polyclonal antibody ( ab6556 , Abcam ) and FLAG afﬁnity isolated antibody ( F7425 , Sigma ) to label plasmids containing GFP and FLAG , respectively . mCherry rabbit polyclonal antibody ( ab167453 , Abcam ) was used to recognize mcherry RAN Q69L . To recognize endogenous YAP and TAZ , YAP mouse monoclonal antibody ( clone 63 . 7 produced in mouse , sc101199 , Santa Cruz ) and TAZ mouse monoclonal antibody ( 560235 , BD Biosciences ) were used . Phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase ( Tyr397 ) was stained with a rabbit polyclonal antibody ( 44 - 624G , Thermoﬁsher ) . Hoechst 33342 ( Invitrogen ) and Phalloidin – Tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate ( Sigma ) were used to stain the nucleus and ﬁlamentous actin respectively . LATS1 and MST2 were stained with a rabbit monoclonal antibody ( 3477 , Cell Signaling ) and a rabbit polyclonal antibody ( 3682 , Cell Signaling ) , respectively . In some cases , cells were treated with 20 nM Leptomycin B ( L2913 , Sigma ) 3h before ﬁxation , or 2 m M Cytochalasin D ( C8273 , Sigma ) 1h before ﬁxation . The time frame of leptomycin B treat - ment maximized nuclear export blockage , while minimizing effects on import . The same concentrations and treatment times were applied in AFM and FRAP experiments described below . Cell spreading experiments Cells transfected with EGFP - YAP and Hoechst were seeded on 29 kPa polyacrylamide gels . 30 min later , the medium was cleaned with PBS and replaced , and gels were placed on an inverted microscope ( Nikon Eclipse Ti ) with a 40x objective ( NA = 0 . 95 ) . Images were taken every 3 min while cells were spreading . The level of nuclear YAP was measured as described above . The rotation angle respect to the origin was measured with custom made MATLAB software . The software segments the nucleus for every time point , detects the major axis of the nucleus and quantiﬁes the angle of the major axis respect to the origin . The nuclear rotation speed was measured as the absolute value of the angle difference between two consecutive time steps divided by the time step . Preparation , procedure and quantiﬁcation of stretch experiments Stretch experiments were carried out using a stretch device coupled to an upright Nikon eclipse Ni - U microscope as described before ( Casares et al . , 2015 ; Kosmalska et al . , 2015 ) . Brieﬂy , stretchable membranes were prepared by mixing PDMS base and crosslinker at a 10 : 1 ratio , spinning the mixture for 1 min at 500 rpm , and curing it at 65 (cid:4) C overnight . Once cured , PDMS membraned were peeled off and placed tightly on the stretching device . Then , previously polymerized polyacrylamide gels were pressed on the PDMS membrane and left overnight at 37 (cid:4) C in a humid chamber . PDMS membranes were previously treated for covalent binding with 3 - aminopropyl triethoxysilane , 10 % in ethanol for 1 h at 65 (cid:4) C and with glutaraldehyde ( 1 . 5 % ) in PBS for 25 min at room tem - perature . When polyacrylamide gels were bound to the membrane , they were coated with a 10 m g / ml ﬁbronectin solution overnight at 4 (cid:4) C . After ﬁbronectin coating cells were seeded on the gels , and after 2h membranes were placed on the stretch system . The stretch system has an opening between the central loading post and the external ring . Vacuum is applied through the opening , and deforms and stretches the membrane equibiaxially . For stretch experiments , cells were submitted to 4 % linear strain ( corre - sponding to an 8 % increase in surface area ) . Images before and after stretching cells transfected with pEYFP - mem ( to delimit the cell ) and Hoechst ( to delimit the nucleus ) were obtained using an upright microscope ( Nikon eclipse Ni - U ) with a water immersion 60x objective ( NA = 1 . 0 ) . For each cell , in order to measure nuclear or cellular strain from images , the length increase of each nucleus and cell was measured . Atomic Force Experiments and quantiﬁcation AFMexperiments were carried out in a Nanowizard 4 AFM ( JPK ) mounted on top of a Nikon Ti Eclipse microscope . Polystyrene beads of 20 m m were attached using a non - ﬂuorescent adhesive ( NOA63 , Norland Products ) to the end of tipless MLCT cantilevers ( Veeco ) . The spring constant of the cantilevers was calibrated by thermal tuning using the simple harmonic oscillator model . Experiments were carried out on cells previously transfected with EGFP - YAP and incubated with Hoechst 33342 ( Invitrogen ) , and seeded on gels in the different conditions described in the results sections . For each cell , the nucleus was identiﬁed by using the Hoechst ﬂuorescence signal , and a force of 1 . 5 nN was applied either to the nuclear region or the cytoplasm ( for control experiments ) . Once the maximum force was reached , the indentation was kept constant for 5 min under force control , adjusting the z height by feedback control . After the 5 min of indentation , the cantilever was retracted . An image of cell ﬂuorescence ( both in the EGFP and Hoechst channels ) was captured every minute for 11 min ( 2 before indentation , 5 during indentation and 4 after release ) by an Orca ER camera ( Hamamatsu ) and a 40X ( NA = 0 . 95 ) objective . The force applied corresponded to an average ﬁnal indentation of 1 . 11 ± 0 . 3 m m ( as measured in n = 6 cells , mean ± s . e . m . ) . As almost all the cell height in this region corresponds to the nucleus ( as observed in confocal slices ) , this indentation corresponds to a change in nuclear ﬂattening ( nuclear length / height ) from 1 . 88 to 2 . 23 , in line with the variations caused by rigidity and osmotic shocks in Figure 4C . We note that by applying the Hertz contact model , this indentation corresponds to a diameter of contact Cell 171 , 1397 – 1410 . e1 – e6 , November 30 , 2017 e3 between the cell and the spherical probe of 6 . 7 m m , and a region of deformation which would be somewhat larger but of the same order . This scale of deformation coincides with the measured length scale ( (cid:3) 10 m m ) of nuclei on 5 kPa gels ( where most AFM experiments were conducted ) , thereby providing a mechanical stimulation small enough to selectively deform the nuclear region , but large enough to do so globally . Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments and quantiﬁcation To measure YAP transport in the nucleus , cells were transfected with EGFP - YAP , and plated on 5 or 29kPa polyacrylamide gels 4h before starting the experiment . An area that comprised the nucleus or the cytoplasm was deﬁned in order to bleach the volume con - tained in that area . The area was bleached with a 488 nm laser ( 50 % power , 2 repeats of 60 m s dwell time ) using an inverted confocal spinning disk microscope ( Andor ) . After bleaching , three z stack images covering 5 m m were acquired with a 60x oil - immersion objec - tive ( NA = 1 . 40 ) to conﬁrm that the entire nuclear volume was affected . For each cell , images were taken every 300ms during the ﬁrst 63 s , and every 5 s ( to minimize photobleaching ) for 5 more minutes . For each cell , we calculated the dynamics of nuclear YAP levels as : F = YAP nuc ð t Þ (cid:1) YAP nuc bleach YAP intcell ð t Þ 3 c ratio 3 c bleach Where YAP nuc ( t ) is the average YAP intensity in the nucleus with time , YAP nuc bleach is the average YAP intensity of the nucleus in the frame right after the nucleus is bleached , and YAP intcell ( t ) is the integrated YAP intensity of the cell with time . Dividing by YAP intcell ( t ) normalizes the results by the overall level of transfection of each cell . Two further correction factors were deﬁned as : c ratio = YAP intcell ð prebleach Þ YAP intcytosol ð prebleach Þ ( for nuclear bleaching experiments ) c ratio = YAP intcell ð prebleach Þ YAP intnucleus ð prebleach Þ ( for cytosolic bleaching experiments ) c bleach = YAP intcell ð bleach Þ YAP intcell ð t Þ C ratio is the ratio between the integrated ﬂuorescent intensity of the entire cell , and of the cytosol or nucleus , before bleaching . This parameter is introduced to correct for the fact that the YAP intcell ( t ) only quantiﬁes either cytosolic or nuclear ﬂuorescence levels ( depending on the experiment ) , because either the nucleus or the cytoplasm has been bleached . C bleach corrects for progressive photobleaching by calculating the ratio between the integrated ﬂuorescence intensity of the cell right after photobleaching , and the same parameter as a function of time . In all cases , background ﬂuorescence was subtracted from ﬂuorescence values before calculations . The import and export rates were quantiﬁed as : Rate = v 3 c ratio Where v is the speed of YAP nuclear import or export , obtained as the slope of a ﬁrst degree polynomial ﬁt to F during the ﬁrst 30 s of measurement . The measurement of v was done during the initial 30 s to best reﬂect protein import or export only , rather than the balance between the two that occurs after a signiﬁcant portion of unbleached protein reenters the bleached region . Finally , import / export rates were obtained by multiplying v by c ratio , to account for the fact that import / export speeds will be the product of import / export rates times the concentration of protein available for import / export . The import or export rate is measured if the nucleus or the cytosol is bleached , respectively . As an important control , we note that this quantiﬁcation correctly reproduced the expected changes in import / export rates after treating cells with known inhibitors of nuclear transport ( Figure S3 ) . Cell monolayer experiments and quantiﬁcation PDMS membranes with 200 m m diameter circular holes were incubated in a 2 % Pluronic F - 127 ( Sigma ) solution for 1h . The PDMS membranes were then washed in PBS and air - dried for 20 min before placing them on previously polymerized 15 kPa polyacrylamide gels . A 10 m g / ml mix of ﬂuorescent ﬁbronectin ( Thermo Fisher ) and non - ﬂuorescent ﬁbronectin ( Sigma ) was added to the region with micropatterns and incubated overnight at 4 (cid:4) C . After ﬁbronectin incubation , PDMS membranes were removed and gels were washed . Then , for traction force microscopy measurements , images of the ﬂuorescently labeled ﬁbronectin in circular patterns and underlying embedded ﬂuorescent nanobeads were taken with a 60x oil immersion objective ( NA = 1 . 40 ) on a spinning disk confocal microscope ( Andor ) . Those images provided a reference of the relaxed position of the gel before force application by cells . Then , MCF10A cells were seeded on the micropatterns and left overnight , before obtaining phase contrast images of patterns and of the embedded e4 Cell 171 , 1397 – 1410 . e1 – e6 , November 30 , 2017 ﬂuorescent nanobeads . Immediately after image acquisition , cells were ﬁxed with 4 % paraformaldehyde . Immunostaining of YAP and Hoechst were performed in order quantify single cells nuclear / cytosolic YAP as described above . Deformation maps were obtained by comparing the ﬂuorescence nanobeads image of patterns with and without cells , using previously described particle image velocimetry software ( Serra - Picamal et al . , 2012 ) . From the deformation maps , tractions were inferred assuming that displace - ments were caused by cells by applying a previously described Fourier Transform algorithm ( Bazellie ` res et al . , 2015 ; Butler et al . , 2002 ) . Osmotic shocks and permeability experiments Cells were seeded on ﬁbronectin coated gels of 5 , 29 and 150kPa for 3h . For nuclear permeability experiments , 30 m M Pitstop2 ( Abcam ) and 258 mM trans - 1 , 2 - Cyclohexanediol ( Sigma ) were added for 1h and 5 min , respectively , before ﬁxing the sample with 4 % paraformaldehyde . For osmotic shocks , cells were ﬁxed with 4 % paraformaldehyde 10 min after the shocks . Cell medium has an osmolarity of (cid:3) 340 mOsm . (cid:3) 113 mOsm hypo - osmotic shocks ( 66 % ) were performed by mixing 1 / 3 medium with 2 / 3 de - ionized water . (cid:3) 695 mOsm Hyper - osmotic shocks ( 204 % ) were performed by adding 7 . 8 m M D - mannitol ( Sigma ) to the medium . After ﬁxing samples , Immunostaining of YAP and Hoechst was performed and nuclear / cytosolic YAP ratio was measured as described above . Transmission electron microscopy For transmission electron microscopy experiments , 5 and 150 kPa polyacrylamide hydrogels were polymerized on top of 12 mm coverslips . Cells were seeded for two hours and ﬁxed with 2 , 5 % glutaraldehyde / 1 % Paraformaldehyde for 1h at room temperature . Then , cells were post - ﬁxed in the dark with 1 % osmium tetroxide 0 , 8 % K4Fe ( CN ) 6 ( 1 hr , room temperature ) . Following ﬁxation , coverslips were rinsed with 0 . 1M Phosphate buffer before being dehydrated in an acetone series ( 50 % , 70 % , 90 % , 96 % and 100 % , 10 min each ) . Coverslips were inﬁltrated and embedded in Epon ( EMS ) . Blocs were obtained after polymerization at 60 (cid:4) C for 48 hr . 38 % – 40 % hydroﬂuoric acid was used to remove the coverslip . Ultrathin sections of 60 nm in thickness were obtained using a UC7 ultramicrotome ( Leica Microsystems , Vienna , Austria ) . Sections were then stained with 5 % uranyl acetate (cid:1) 10’ and lead citrate (cid:1) 10’ . Sections were observed in a Tecnai Spirit microscope ( EM ) ( FEI , Eindhoven , the Netherlands ) equipped with a LaB6 cathode . Images were acquired at 120 kV with a 1376 3 1024 pixel CCD Megaview camera . In images , the nuclear pores seen in cross - section with the nuclear basket visible were selected . Nuclear pore length was measured from one side of the double bilayer , at the point where the nuclear basket ( black line ) begins , to the other side of the double bilayer where the nuclear basket ends . Single molecule experiments To construct the ProteinL 2 - YAP - ProteinL 2 polyprotein used in AFM experiments , the YAP gene ( Life Technologies ) was ligated into the PQE80L vector ( QIAGEN ) using the restriction enzymes BamHI , BglII and KpnI . The recombinant polyprotein was then trans - formed into E . coli BLR ( DE ) 3 cells and grown in LB medium with 100 m g / mL ampicillin at 37 (cid:4) C until an OD 600 of 0 . 6 was reached . Cultures were then induced with 1mM Isopropyl b - D - 1 - thiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG ) and left overnight at 20 (cid:4) C . Cells were harvested by centrifugation , resuspended in 50mM phosphate buffer pH 7 , 300mM NaCl , 100mg / ml lysozyme , 5 m g / ml Dnase I , 5 m g / ml Rnase A and 10mM MgCl2 ; and disrupted with a French Press . The protein was then puriﬁed by histidine metal afﬁnity chromatography with TALON resin ( Takara ) and the eluted protein with 250mM imidazole was loaded into a Superdex 200 GL 10 / 300 column ( GE Healthcare ) in PBS buffer . Constant velocity AFM experiments were conducted at room temperature using both a home - made set - up ( Schlierf et al . , 2004 ) and a commercial Luigs and Neumann force spectrometer ( Popa et al . , 2013 ) . In all cases , the sample was prepared by depositing 1 – 10 m l of protein in PBS solution ( at a concentration of 1 – 10 mg ml (cid:1) 1 ) on a freshly evaporated gold coverslide . Each cantilever ( Si 3 N 4 Bruker MLCT - AUHW ) was individually calibrated using the equipartition theorem , giving rise to a typical spring constant of (cid:3) 12 – 35 pN nm (cid:1) 1 . Single proteins were picked up from the surface and pulled at a constant velocity of 400 nm s (cid:1) 1 . Experiments were carried out in a sodium phosphate buffer solution , speciﬁcally , 50 mM sodium phosphate ( Na 2 HPO 4 and NaH 2 PO 4 ) , 150 mM NaCl , pH = 7 . 2 . All data were recorded and analyzed using the custom software written in Igor Pro 6 . 0 ( Wavemetrics ) . For all poly - proteins , only recordings showing the signature of at least three events corresponding to the unfolding of the Protein L ﬁngerprint were analyzed . Dextran experiments For dextran nuclear incorporation experiments , cells were permeabilized with 20 m g / ml digitonin ( Millipore ) for 5 min as previously described ( Adam et al . , 1990 ; Liashkovich et al . , 2015 ) . At this concentration , digitonin permeabilizes the plasma membrane without affecting the nuclear envelope ( Adam et al . , 1990 ; Liashkovich et al . , 2015 ) . After permeabilization , cells were imaged every 10 s with an oil immersion 60x objective ( NA = 1 . 40 ) in an inverted confocal spinning disk microscope ( Andor ) . 200 m g / ml of Dextran - FITC ( Sigma ) of different molecular weights ( 20 , 40 , 70 and 150 kDa ) were then added . Once background ﬂuorescence stabilized after dextran addition , this was taken as the point of origin and changes in nuclear ﬂuorescence ( after background subtraction ) were measured as a function of time . Cell 171 , 1397 – 1410 . e1 – e6 , November 30 , 2017 e5 Western blots Western blots were implemented following standard procedures . Brieﬂy , cells were lysed using RIPA buffer . Following denaturation , lysates were loaded on 4 % – 20 % polyacrylamide gels ( Bio - Rad ) and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane ( Whatman , GE Healthcare Life Sciences ) . After blocking , the membranes were incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 (cid:4) C and with the horseradish - peroxidase ( HRP ) - conjugated secondary antibody for 2 hr at room temperature . ECL Western Blotting Substrate ( Pierce , ThermoFisher ) was used to detect HRP and the bands were visualized with the ImageQuant LAS 400 imaging system ( GE Healthcare Life Sciences ) . The intensity of the bands was analyzed using ImageJ software . Primary antibodies used were a rabbit polyclonal antibody to detect phosphorylated YAP ( Ser127 ) ( 4911 , Cell Signaling ) , a mouse monoclonal antibody to recognize Talin ( T3287 , Sigma ) and a mouse monoclonal antibody to detect GAPDH ( sc - 32233 , Santa Cruz ) . To detect FLAG , GFP , YAP , LATS1 and MST2 in western blots , the same antibodies as for immunostainings ( described in the immunostaining section above ) were used . Single cell Traction Force Microscopy measurements Traction force microscopy measurements were carried out as described previously ( Elosegui - Artola et al . , 2014 ; Elosegui - Artola et al . , 2016 ) . Brieﬂy , cellswereseededonagelwithadeﬁnedrigidity , andplacedonaninvertedmicroscope ( NikonEclipseTi ) . Phasecontrast imagesofsinglecellsandﬂuorescentimagesoftheembeddednanobeadsweretakenwithan40x ( NA = 0 . 6 ) objective . Then , cellswere trypsinizedandimagesoftheembeddednanobeadsintherelaxedpositionweretaken . Previouslydescribedparticleimagevelocimetry ( Serra - Picamal et al . , 2012 ) was used to obtain deformation maps comparing bead position in the absence or presence of cells . Then , assumingthatdeformationswerecausedbyforcesexertedbythecellinthegel , forcesmapswereinferredusingapreviouslydescribed Fourier transform algorithm ( Bazellie ` res et al . , 2015 ; Butler et al . , 2002 ) . The average force for each cell was then measured . Constructs and transfections For stretch experiments , cells were transfected with membrane - targeting plasmid pEYFP - mem ( Clontech ) described previously ( Kosmalska et al . , 2015 ) . EGFP - Nesprin1 - KASH , EGFP - Nesprin2 - KASH and EGFP were described previously ( Zhang et al . , 2001 ) . EGFP - YAP ( Addgene plasmid # 17843 ) , described as pEGFP - C3 - hYAP1 ) ( Basu et al . , 2003 ) , FLAG - YAP ( Addgene plasmid # 17791 , described as p2xFLAGhYAP1 ) and FLAG - YAP S127A ( Addgene plasmid # 17790 , described as p2xFLAGhYAP1 - S127A ) ( Komuro et al . , 2003 ) were a gift from Marius Sudol . FLAG - YAP S94A and FLAG - YAP S94A - NLS were a gift from Dae - Sik Lim ( Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology , Korea ) ( Kim et al . , 2015 ) . MST2 ( Addgene plasmid # 12205 , described as pJ3M - Mst2 ) was a gift from Jonathan Chernoff ( Creasy et al . , 1996 ) . LATS1 ( Addgene plasmid # 66851 , described as pClneoMyc - LATS1 ) was a gift from Yutaka Hata ( Bao et al . , 2011 ) . RanQ69L ( Addgene plasmid # 30309 , described as pmCherry - C1 - RanQ69L ) was a gift from Jay Brenman ( Kazgan et al . , 2010 ) . FLAG - R16 - YAP , FLAG - I27 - YAP , FLAG - I27 V11P - YAP , and FLAG - Spy0128 - YAP were generated by amplifying the genes encoding the R16 domain of spectrin , I27 domain of titin ( with or without V11P one point mutation ) , and the Spy0128 domain of Pilin by PCR to add a KpnI restriction site , and subse - quently subcloning them into the p2xFLAGhYAP1 vector ( Addgene ) . In the case of 2xEGFP - YAP , the gene was ampliﬁed by PCR to add a BglII restriction site and was subsequently inserted into the pEGFP - C3 - hYAP1 vector ( Addgene ) . Additional versions of these plasmids were generated by removing YAP ( leaving thus the FLAG tag and the different fragments ) , with or without adding the Nuclear Localization Signal ( NLS ) of SV40 large T antigen ( CCTCCAAAAAAGAAGAGAAAGGTAGAAGACCCCT ) . 2xGFP , GFP - R16 and GFP - I27 were generated by inserting the corresponding genes into the pEGFP vector . In all experiments involving transfections , the Neon transfection device ( ThermoFisher ) was used according to manufacturer’s instructions . Talin 2 shRNA was used to deplete talin levels as described previously ( Elosegui - Artola et al . , 2016 ) . All transfections were done the day before the experiment except for talin 2 shRNA experiments that were transfected 5 days before experiment . In overexpression experiments , transfection was assessed in experiments by either evaluating GFP / mcherry ﬂuorescence ( in live experiments ) or by staining for speciﬁc construct tags in immunostaining experiments ( GFP , mcherry , FLAG , or MYC depending on the construct ) . Only clearly transfected cells were measured . QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Statistical comparisons were carried out using SigmaStat with two - tailed Student’s t tests when two cases were compared and with analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) tests when more cases were analyzed . When data did not meet normality criteria , equivalent non - para - metric tests were used . Differences were considered to be signiﬁcant when p values were below 0 . 05 . Details on sample numbers and signiﬁcance levels are given in ﬁgure legends . In all ﬁgures , measurements are reported as mean ± standard error of the mean ( s . e . m . ) .
