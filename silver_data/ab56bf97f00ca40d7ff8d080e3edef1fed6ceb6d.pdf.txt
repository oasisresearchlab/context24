Abstract An experimental study of search - image use by araneophagic jumping spiders ( i . e . , salticid spiders that prey routinely on other spiders ) supports five conclusions . First , araneophagic salticids have an innate predisposition to form search images for specific prey from their pre - ferred prey category ( spiders ) rather than for prey from a non - preferred category ( insects ) . Second , single encoun - ters are sufficient for forming search images . Third , search images are based on selective attention specifically to op - tical cues . Fourth , there are trade - offs in attention during search - image use ( i . e . , forming a search image for one type of spider diminishes the araneophagic salticid’s at - tention to other spiders ) . Fifth , the araneophagic salticid’s adoption of search images is costly to the prey ( i . e . , when the araneophagic salticid adopts a search , the prey’s pros - pects for surviving encounters with the araneophagic salti - cid are diminished ) . Cognitive and ecological implica - tions of search - image use are discussed . Keywords Search image · Selective attention · Spiders · Portia · Scytodes Introduction Independent of the human - oriented psychological tradi - tion ( Pashler 1998 ) , biologists who study animal behav - iour have grappled with the topic of selective attention , but largely by another name , ‘search images’ . The term search image comes from Tinbergen ( 1960 ) who argued that a predator , after discovering a particular type of prey , ‘gets an eye for’ or ‘learns to see’ this particular type of prey . That predators might form search images for partic - ular types of prey has been the rationale for extensive re - search during the past four decades ( Mook et al . 1960 ; Croze 1970 ; Lawrence 1986 ; Bond and Kamil 1998 , 2002 ) and also the source of considerable controversy ( Lawrence and Allen 1983 ; Guilford and Dawkins 1987 ) . Adopting a perspective that is more explicitly cognitive , findings from experimental studies of search - image use have been interpreted as evidence that previous experience by the predator with a particular type of prey triggers selective attention to specific features of this prey ( Dawkins 1971a , 1971b ; Pietrewicz and Kamil 1979 ; Bond 1983 ; Blough 1991 ; Langley et al . 1995 ; Plaisted and MacIntosh 1995 ) . Reluctance to attribute significant cognitive capacity to arthropods and other invertebrates may account for why the subjects of search - image research have been primarily ‘higher’ vertebrates , especially birds . Rausher’s ( 1978 ) evidence that ovipositing butterflies adopt search images for specific leaf shapes is a notable exception . Whether search images play a significant role in foraging strategies of predatory arthropods remains poorly understood and might be doubted on the basis of neural limitations . How - ever , there is considerable evidence that spiders , despite having small nervous systems , are useful subjects for re - search on learning ( e . g . , Grunbaum 1927 ; Punzo 1998 ; Morse 2000 ; Seah and Li 2001 ) , problem solving ( e . g . , Jackson and Wilcox 1994 ; Jackson and Carter 2001 ) and other topics related to animal cognition ( Wilcox and Jack - son 1998 , 2002 ) . Although search - image theory has been extended to in - clude selective attention to specific chemical cues ( Nams 1997 ) , Tinbergen’s ( 1960 ) original formulation and most of the subsequent literature on search images has been concerned with selective attention to specific optical cues . Most spiders have only poorly developed eyesight ( Ho - mann 1971 ; Land and Nilsson 2002 ) , which may discour - age search - image studies on these animals . There is , how - ever , a distinctive exception . Jumping spiders ( Salticidae ) have unique , complex eyes that support spatial resolution Robert R .

Our hypothesis is that search - image use is especially important in the predatory strategies of a particular group of salticids , the araneophagic spartaeines ( i . e . , species that routinely prey on other spiders ) . The most striking exam - ples of araneophagy come from tropical African , Asian and Australasian species in the genus Portia ( Wanless 1978 ; Jackson and Pollard 1996 ) . These salticids capture prey outside webs , in webs they build themselves and in the webs of other spiders ( Jackson 1986 ) . Although they sometimes eat insects , but they prefer spiders as prey ( Li and Jackson 1996 , 1997 ; Jackson et al . 1997 ; Jackson et al . 1998 ) and make intricate prey - choice decisions on the basis of eyesight alone ( Jackson and Wilcox 1998 ; Tarsi - tano et al . 2000 ; Jackson and Carter 2001 ) . Here we investigate four hypotheses concerning how search - image use is integrated into the predatory strate - gies of araneophagic salticids . First , these predators have evolved an innate predisposition to form search images for prey from the preferred category ( i . e . , other spiders ) . Second , for search images , they rely on optical cues . Third , the predator becomes more dangerous to the partic - ular type of prey for which it has formed a search image ( i . e . , being the targets of a predator’s search - image ren - ders prey type more susceptible to being preyed on by the predator ) . Fourth , while using a search image for one prey type , the predator’s attention to other prey types is dimin - ished . Methods We carried out two experiments using Portia labiata as the preda - tor , house flies as prey from a non - preferred category ( insects ) and two web - building species , Scytodes pallida ( Scytodidae ) ( Fig . 1A ) and Micromerys sp . ( Pholcidae ) ( Fig . 1B ) , as prey from the pre - ferred category ( spiders ) . Another web - building species , Zosis genicularis ( Uloboridae ) ( Fig . 1C ) , and a variety of insects ( but not house flies ) were used as maintenance prey for P . labiata , but not as prey in experiments . P . labiata preys on flies and each of these three spider species in nature ( Jackson , unpublished data ) . In the first experiment , we used living prey and investigated whether , af - ter feeding on a given prey type , P . labiata becomes more danger - ous to this particular prey type . In the second experiment , by using lures instead of living prey , we investigated whether P . labiata forms search images for optical cues from the prey type on which it last fed . For experiments , each individual of P . labiata was an unmated adult female ( body length about 10 mm ) that had matured 30 – 40 days beforehand . No individuals of P . labiata had prior experi - ence with S . pallida or Micromerys sp . , or vice versa . All individ - uals of Z . genicularis , S . pallida and Micromerys sp . were 7 – 8 mm in body length . All spiders came from laboratory cultures that orig - inated from specimens collected in the Philippines ( Los Banos , La - guna Province , Luzon ) . Maintenance procedures , cage design , ba - sic testing methods and terminology were as in earlier salticid studies ( Jackson and Hallas 1986 ; Li and Jackson 1996 ) , and only essential details are given here . In the Philippines , S . pallida and Micromerys sp . build sheet webs on the tops of large waxy leaves , and both of these species are often present on the same trees and shrubs in the field . These two spider species appear to be especially dangerous for P . labiata , but for different reasons . One spits and the other has long legs . Yet P . labiata routinely preys on both of these species ( Jackson et al . 1998 ; Jackson and Carter 2001 ; Jackson , unpubl ) . In contrast to S . pallida and Micromerys sp . , Z . genicularis builds an orb web out in the open . Females of S . pallida and Micromerys sp . carry their eggs with their chelicerae until hatching . Portia labiata preys on eggless and on egg - carrying individuals of S . pallida and Micromerys sp . , but prefers egg - carrying individuals of both species ( Li and Jackson 2003 ; Jackson , unpublished data ) . Only egg - carrying individuals of S . pallida and Micromerys sp . were used in experiments . By 248 Fig . 1 A Portia labiata ( right ) approaching egg - carrying Scytodes pallida ( left ) . B P . labiata ( right ) approaching egg - carrying Micro - merys sp . ( left ) . C P . labiata ( left ) approaching Zosis genicularis ( right ) testing with both insects and spiders , we could consider whether P . labiata has a bias toward forming search images for prey from the preferred rather than from a non - preferred category . Although S . pallida and Micromerys sp . have similar pale body colouration , they differ in general appearance . Micromerys sp . is a pholcid spider , and pholcids are characterised by very long legs ( Fig . 1B ) with which they throw silk over prey and web intruders . Micromerys sp . also has a slender body . S . pallida ( Scytodidae ) , however , has shorter legs and a rounder body ( Fig . 1A ) . Among spiders , spitting is unique to the genus Scytodes ( Foelix 1996 ) . By forcefully expelling sticky gum from their fangs , scyto - dids can immobilize prey and potential predators from as far as ten body lengths away ( Dabelow 1958 ; McAlistair 1960 ; Gilbert and Rayor 1985 ; Nentwig 1985 ) . S . pallida is an especially interesting scytodid from this genus because it preys primarily on salticids ( Li et al . 1999 ) . Maintenance diet for S . pallida was a variety of insect and salti - cid species ( but not P . labiata ) . Micromerys sp . and Z . genicularis feed primarily on insects in nature ( Jackson , unpublished data ) , and the maintenance diet of these species in the laboratory was house flies ( M . domestica ) and vinegar flies ( Drosophila melano - gaster ) . House flies and vinegar flies were from standard cultures , as in earlier studies ( Jackson and Hallas 1986 ) . All experiments were carried out between 0900 hours and 1700 hours ( laboratory photo - period , 12L : 12D , with lights coming on at 0800hours ) . No individuals of P . labiata , S . pallida or Micro - merys sp . were used in more than one experiment or provided data more than once for any one experiment . For each experiment , the individuals of P . labiata , S . pallida and Micromerys sp . used were derived from at least eight ‘sibships’ , where a sibship is defined as the progeny of a particular male and female , and there was no evi - dence that sibship origin influenced experimental outcome . The number of individuals from each sibship was about equal for each experiment . Laboratory - rearing environments were ‘enriched’ ( spa - cious cages , meshwork of twigs within each cage ) in a manner comparable to that described by Carducci and Jakob ( 2000 ) . Before experiments began , S . pallida and Micromerys sp . were established in webs for testing by placing a waxy green dipterocarp or podocarp leaf inside a cage made from a plastic petri dish ( di - ameter , 148 mm ) , with the leaf filling about half the surface area of the cage . The leaf had a slightly concave upper surface . The web occupant , an egg - carrying female that had oviposited for the first time 2 – 3 days beforehand , was put in the cage and provided ad li - bitum with vinegar flies and house flies for 5 – 7 days , during which time it built a web on the leaf . No eggs had hatched when testing began . Immediately before needed , vacant webs were obtained by prodding the spider with a soft brush until it left the web . Sometimes we used a ‘web occupied by a fly’ , this expression meaning that , when used as pre - trial or trial prey ( see below ) , a liv - ing house fly was on or close to a web on a leaf . We achieved this by first immobilizing the fly under carbon dioxide gas and then us - ing a short piece of fine white nylon twine to tether it to the leaf . One end of the twine was tied around the fly between its thorax and abdomen ( under the fly’s wings ) . The other end was tied to the petiole of a leaf on which there was a vacant web of either S . pal - lida or Micromerys sp . Flies actively walked about , both near and on the web . However , the flies did not undertake sustained flight because the tether was short ( 15 mm ) . Tests of independence , using chi - square and Fisher exact , were carried out on the data ( see Sokal and Rohlf 1995 ) . In some in - stances , the same data were used in two different comparisons . In these instances , Bonferroni adjustments were applied ( i . e . , ad - justed alpha = 0 . 025 ) . Prey - survival experiment Methods After reaching maturity , each test spider ( P . labiata ) was fed to sa - tiation each day and then subjected to a 10 - day pre - trial fast im - mediately before testing . At 0800 hours on the day following the fast , the test spider was put into a clean cage and one prey individ - ual ( the ‘pre - trial prey’ ) was introduced into the cage of the test spider . When successful , the test spider captured and ate this prey . Testing began 60 min later . Any test spiders that failed to eat the pre - trial prey before 1400 hours were returned to their cages and 249 Fig . 2 Experimental procedures and grouping of test spiders ( P . labiata ) used in prey - survival experiment and in prey - detection experiment not used , but the 10 - day fast ensured that this was rarely neces - sary . Tests were carried out in a glass tank ( 300 - mm long × 140 - mm wide × 160 - mm tall ) . In the centre of the tank’s glass lid , there was a 10 - mm wide hole . This hole was kept plugged with a cork except when introducing the test spider into the tank . Ten webs ( all built by the same spider species ) were taken from the petri - dish cages at 1700 hours on the day before testing began . For each trial , only one of the ten webs was occupied ( i . e . , one of the ten spiders , cho - sen at random , was left in its web ; or one of the vacant webs was chosen at random and the fly was tethered to this leaf ) . Each leaf was clamped to the top of a plastic dowel ( diameter 15 mm ) , and each dowel was held upright by a metal base ( diame - ter 60 mm ) . The ten dowels were spaced evenly across the floor of the tank . Each leaf was oriented so that it angled 45° upward , with the web being on the top surface . The higher end of each leaf was about 10 mm below the tank lid . The occupied web was on one of the leaves situated near the centre of the tank . A test spider was introduced into the tank and left for 24 h , af - ter which we recorded whether the web occupant was dead or alive . All dead web occupants were examined under a microscope , and all were seen to be masticated , consistent with having been eaten by P . labiata . Test spiders were assigned at random to three groups ( 600 trials for each group ) , with each group defined by the trial prey ( Fig . 2 ) . The test spiders in each group were next assigned at random to one of three subgroups ( 200 trials per subgroup ) . The fly used as trial prey for the subgroup FS was tethered to a vacant web of a scyto - did . For subgroup FP , the fly used as trial prey was tethered to a vacant web of a pholcid . For subgroup FF , 100 of the flies used as trial prey were tethered to scytodid webs and 100 were tethered to pholcid webs , but this distinction was ignored for data presentation because there was no evidence that web type influenced the fre - quency with which flies were captured . Results When the trial prey was a scytodid ( Table 1 ) , the test spider more often ate the scytodid when the pre - trial prey was also a scytodid and less often ate the scytodid when the pre - trial prey was a phol - cid ( X 2 = 15 . 21 , P < 0 . 001 ) or a house fly ( X 2 = 20 . 70 , P < 0 . 001 ) . When the trial prey was a pholcid , the test spider more often ate the pholcid when the pre - trial prey was also a pholcid and less of - ten ate the pholcid when the pre - trial prey was a scytodid ( X 2 = 17 . 42 , P < 0 . 001 ) or a fly ( X 2 = 14 . 12 , P < 0 . 001 ) . However , re - gardless of what the pre - trial prey had been , predation was rare when the trial prey was a fly , and there was no evidence that pre - trial prey feeding on a fly influenced how often the fly was eaten during trials ( pre - trial prey a fly compared with pre - trial prey a pholcid , X 2 = 2 . 71 P = 0 . 100 ; pre - trial prey a fly compared with pre - trial prey a scytodid , X 2 = 0 . 18 , P = 0 . 674 ) . Next we consider whether a pre - trial feeding on one type of spider diminished how often P . labiata ate the other type of spider . Data from trials in which the pre - trial prey was a fly and the trial prey was a spider are used as a baseline . The rationale for using this baseline was not having found any evidence that pre - trial feed - ing on a fly made P . labiata selectively attentive to cues from the fly . There was no evidence that having fed before on a pholcid in - fluenced whether the test spider ate the scytodid during the trial ( SP compared with SF , X 2 = 0 . 47 , P = 0 . 493 ) and no evidence that having fed before on a scytodid influenced whether the test spider ate the pholcid during the trial ( PS compared with PF , X 2 = 0 . 20 , P = 0 . 658 ) . That is , contrary to the prediction from the trade - off hy - pothesis , there was no evidence that having just fed on one type of spider diminished how dangerous P . labiata was to another type of spider . However , this prediction is given further consideration in the next section . Prey - detection experiment Next we investigate four hypotheses suggested by these findings from the prey - survival experiment . First , increased danger to the recently - fed - upon prey type is a consequence of P . labiata forming a search image for this prey type . Second , P . labiata ’s search im - ages are based on selective attention to optical cues . Third , P . labiata is strongly predisposed to adopt search images for prey from its preferred category ( spiders ) and not so strongly predisposed to adopt search images for prey from a non - preferred category ( in - sects ) . Fourth , when using a search image for one type of spider , P . labiata ’s ability to detect another type of spider is impaired . Methods For trial prey and for pre - trial prey , the groups and subgroups were the same as in the prey - survival experiment ( Fig . 2 ) , and the inter - vals between pre - trial feeding and experimental trials were also the same . 250 Table 1 Results from prey - survival experiment .

Not to scale . Wooden ramp inclined at 20° from horizontal and supported by one wooden pole ( diameter 20 mm ) . Pole slotted into a hole in 50 - mm wide wooden base . Pit ( diameter 30 mm ) centred 30 mm from bottom end of ramp . Pit used for holding test spider ( P . labiata ) before each trial . Piece of wood ( ‘wall’ ) shaped to hold a plastic petri - dish ( diameter 90 mm ) at upper end of ramp . Web ( built by S . pallida or by Mircomerys sp . ) in petri dish on wall . Lure ( S . pal - lida , Mircomerys sp . or Musca domestica ) positioned facing down in centre of web Except for two modifications required by our different objec - tive , we adopted testing methods that have been used previously for alternate - day testing of prey choice ( Li and Jackson 1996 ) . First , we made it more difficult for P . labiata to see what was in the web . Second , each individual of P . labiata was tested only once , with one prey . The individuals of S . pallida , Micromerys sp . and M . domestica used for lures were first immobilized under carbon dioxide and then preserved in 80 % ethanol . A lure was made by removing the spider or fly , letting it dry , and then mounting it in a lifelike pos - ture centred on a disc - shaped piece of cork ( diameter ca . 1 . 25 × the spider’s body length ) . For preservation , the mounted dead spider and the cork were coated with plastic aerosol ( Crystal Clear Lac - quer , Atsco , Australia ) . Each spider was an egg - carrying scytodid or pholcid , mounted with its eggsac pressed against its mouthparts . The testing apparatus was a wooden ramp ( Fig . 3 ) , at the upper end of which there was a lure in a web , with the web being inside a plastic petri dish . Webs were obtained as in the prey - survival ex - periment . The web was oriented vertically and the lure was posi - tioned facing down in the centre of web . The lure stayed in place because the cork became entangled in the web silk . Before each trial , a test spider ( P . labiata ) was in a pit at the base of the ramp . The pit was kept covered with a clear plastic petri dish until the test spider became quiescent . Once the test spi - der was quiescent , the pit was uncovered to start a trial . During testing , P . labiata walked up the arm and viewed a lure . Success - ful trials ended when the test spider , after leaving the pit , did one of the following : ( 1 ) oriented toward the lure ( i . e . , aligned its large anterior - medial eyes with the lure ) and maintained this orientation while moving past the threshold ( recorded as an instance of a test spider detecting the lure ) ; ( 2 ) walked or leapt off the ramp without crossing the threshold ( recorded as an instance of not detecting the lure ) ; ( 3 ) remained on the ramp for 30 min , but failed to cross the threshold ( recorded as an instance of not detecting the lure ) . The arm’s ‘threshold’ was defined by a line midway up the ramp ( i . e . , about 50 mm from the lure ) . Trials were aborted whenever test spiders failed to leave the pit within 30 min , left the pit but then failed to stay on the top surface of the ramp for more than 2 min , left the pit and then ran immedi - ately across the threshold , or left the pit and then moved across the threshold without first orienting toward the lure . Aborted trials were rare , and spiders from aborted trials were not tested again . A 200 - W incandescent lamp , positioned ca . 600 mm over head , lit the entire apparatus . Fluorescent ceiling lamps provided addi - tional ambient lighting . A white cardboard screen surrounded the ramp on three sides , the open side being for the observer . The ramp was positioned so that during the trial the test spider moved away from the open side and the observer . Between trials , the ramp was wiped off with 80 % ethanol and distilled water , and then al - lowed to dry for at least 30 min . During prey - choice testing ( Li and Jackson 1996 ) , where the goal was to ascertain Portia ’s preferences , we provided Portia with an unobstructed view of the prey because our goal was to as - certain whether Portia chose one prey instead of another . Here our goal is to ascertain whether Portia ’s previous meal influenced how readily it detected a particular prey type . We achieved this goal by placing a meshwork of fine , white nylon twine over the petri dish . The meshwork was made by first cutting away the top of the petri - dish lid , leaving a rim that fitted on to the dish containing the web . The nylon meshwork was glued to the plastic rim ( 20 evenly - spaced taut lines , 10 running up and down and 10 running cross - wise ) . We also tested our prediction that effects on selective attention would be evident only when the lures were partially obscured . This was achieved by using another set of P . labiata and lures , and the methods were as before except that the nylon meshwork was left off the petri dishes . Results First we consider findings from tests with the mesh in place ( Table2 ) . The test spider more often detected a scytodid when the pre - trial prey was a scytodid than when the pre - trial prey was a pholcid ( X 2 = 76 . 27 , P < 0 . 001 ) or a fly ( X 2 = 30 . 13 , P < 0 . 001 ) . The test spider more often detected a lure made from a pholcid when the pre - trial prey was also a pholcid than a when the pre - trial prey was a scyto - did ( X 2 = 65 . 44 , P < 0 . 001 ) or a fly ( X 2 = 36 . 72 , P < 0 . 001 ) . However , when the trial prey was a fly , how often the test spider detected a fly lure when the pre - trial prey was also a fly did not vary signifi - cantly with how often the test spider detected a fly lure when the pre - trial prey a pholcid ( X 2 = 2 . 85 , P = 0 . 091 ) or a scytodid ( X 2 = 1 . 90 , P = 0 . 168 ) . Next we consider whether pre - trial feeding on one type of spi - der diminished how often P . labiata detected the other type of spi - der . For a baseline , we use the data from trials in which the pre - trial prey was a fly and the trial lure was a spider . P . labiata de - tected the pholcid lure less often than when the pre - trial prey was a scytodid ( 24 . 6 % ) rather than a fly ( 31 . 9 % ) ( PS compared with PF , X 2 = 10 . 13 , P < 0 . 001 ) and detected a scytodid lure less often when the pre - trial prey was a pholcid ( 19 . 0 % ) rather than a fly ( 29 . 1 % ) ( SP compared with SF , X 2 = 5 . 02 , P = 0 . 025 ) . Next we consider findings from testing with no mesh over the lure ( control ) . Here there was no evidence that detection of either type of spider prey was influenced by Portia ’s previous meal ( Ta - ble 3 ) . 251 Table 2 Results from prey - detection experiment .

When we tested with living prey , P . labiata more often found and ate the spider in the testing arena when this spider was the same type as the previously eaten prey . These findings suggest that eating a particular type of spider prepares P . labiata to find this type of spi - der again . Testing with lures ruled out potentially confound - ing influences from uncontrolled prey behaviour ( lures were dead and stationary ) , and testing with lures also con - firmed that the type of prey eaten previously influenced the way P . labiata responded specifically to optical cues ( i . e . , odour , sound and substrate vibration were ruled out ) . This appears to be the first demonstration of search - image use by a spider . However , there are some interesting differences when compared with findings typical of re - search on search - image use by birds . For birds , search im - ages have traditionally been considered in the context of a predator repeatedly encountering prey of a particular type ( Royama 1970 ; Gendron and Staddon 1983 ; Gendron 1986 ; Morgan and Brown 1996 ) , whereas P . labiata apparently adopts a search image for optical cues after a single en - counter with a particular prey type . However , P . labiata ’s single - encounter adoption of optical search images has closer parallels to how rattlesnakes , immediately after striking prey , adopt chemical search images for this prey ( Melcer and Chizar 1989 ) . In both of our experiments , we tested P . labiata with prey ( a house fly ) from a non - preferred category ( insect ) as well as with spiders . There was no evidence that P . labiata formed search images for flies after one encounter or be - came more dangerous to ( i . e . , more likely to prey on ) flies after one encounter . These findings support our hypothe - sis that P . labiata forms search images more readily for prey from the preferred category ( spiders ) than for prey from a non - preferred category ( insects ) . Although we can - not rule out the possibility that P . labiata might form search images for insects after repeated exposure , single - encounter search - image formation appears to be reserved for spider prey . Perhaps other predators have comparable innate bi - ases to form search images for prey from the preferred prey category . What we investigated was specifically whether , after a single encounter with a particular kind of spider , P . labiata becomes prepared to detect optical cues associated with this particular kind of spider . An additional possibility has not yet been investigated . Perhaps P . labiata also becomes prepared to deploy the appropriate tactics for encounters with the particular kind of prey that is associated with par - ticular optical cues . For an araneophagic spider that rou - tinely encounters dangerous prey , both types of prepara - tion may be especially important . That animals have limited capacity ( limited ‘computa - tional resources’ ) for selective attention is commonly ac - knowledged ( Kahnenman 1973 ; Shaw and Shaw 1977 ; van der Heijden 1992 ) , but most of our detailed under - standing of the processes underlying selective attention comes from studies on humans and other primates ( Broad - bent 1958 ; Navon and Gopher 1979 ; Spitzer et al . 1988 ; Corbetta et al . 1990 ; Hillyard et al . 1998 ; Kastner et al . 1998 ) . Even in these animals that have brains vastly larger than an arthropod’s , selective attention appears to require significant computational resources ( Posner and Petersen 1990 ; La Berge 1995 ; Desimone and Duncan 1995 ; Maun - sell 1995 ) , suggesting that capacity limitations are espe - cially pronounced in a spider . The survival experiment showed that a single encounter with one type of spider increased the rate at which P . labiata fed on that type of spider , but provided no evidence that using a search image for one type of spider diminished P . labiata rate of preying on the other type of spider . How - ever , trials in the prey - survival experiment lasted for 24 h , and perhaps this long trial length gave the predator time to overcome any deficit in ability to detect the prey type for which it did not have a search image . Trials in the prey - detection experiment were much shorter ( 30 min ) and provided evidence suggesting that search - image for - mation for one type of spider diminished P . labiata ’s abil - ity to detect other spiders . These findings appear to sup - port the trade - off hypothesis ( i . e . , the hypothesis that com - putational resources are partially exhausted by using search images ) . The findings from the prey - survival experiment might suggest an alternative to the search - image hypothesis . Perhaps prior feeding on one of the two types of spiders has no effect on P . labiata ’s subsequent ability to detect this type of spider and what happens instead is that P . labiata becomes more inclined to feed in the next instance on the type of spider upon which it fed immediately before - hand ( i . e . , this type of spider became more favoured than it had been beforehand ) . However , the altered - preference hypothesis does not so readily explain our findings be - cause evidence of altered preference would be expected especially when lures were made easy to see ( i . e . , when there was no mesh over the lures ) . However , instead of finding this , what we found was that previous feeding af - fected P . labiata ’s response to lures only when the lures were partially obscured from view ( i . e . , only when the lures were hard to see ) . For predators , missed opportunities to feed on alterna - tive prey may be only one of the important costs of search - image use . Another potential cost is diminished attention to cues from potential predators ( see Dukas and Kamil 2000 ) ( i . e . , limited capacity for divided attention ) . Little is known about the level to which Portia might be disadvan - taged by this cost , but there is evidence that Portia ’s prey is subject to costly attention deficits . When wrapping up an insect , a resident spider is less attentive to cues from Portia moving across its web and Portia takes advantage of the prey spider’s limited capacity for divided attention by stepping toward the resident spider especially when the resident spider is busy wrapping up its own prey ( Jackson et al . , 2002 ) . Search - image use by predators may have other important ecological consequences ( Schmidt 1998 ; Dukas and Kamil 2000 , 2001 ) , including the possibility that , by becoming 252 selectively attentive to cues from a particular prey type , a predator may become especially dangerous to this partic - ular prey type ( see Persons et al . 2001 , 2002 ) . Findings from our live - prey experiment are a rare corroboration of this prediction .
