Using the yeast two - hybrid system , we isolated a novel splice variant ( ﬁlamin - B var - 1 ) of the ﬁlamentous actin cross - linking protein , ﬁlamin - B , that interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of the integrin (cid:2) 1A and (cid:2) 1D subunits . RT - PCR analysis showed weak , but wide , expression of ﬁlamin - B var - 1 and a similar splice variant of ﬁlamin - A ( ﬁl - amin - A var - 1 ) in human tissues . Furthermore , alternative splice variants of ﬁlamin - B and ﬁlamin - C , from which the ﬂexible hinge - 1 region is deleted ( (cid:3) H1 ) , were induced during in vitro differentiation of C2C12 mouse myoblasts . We show that both ﬁlamin - A var - 1 and ﬁlamin - B var - 1 bind I more strongly than their wild - type isoforms to different integrin (cid:2) subunits . The mere presence of the high - afﬁnity binding site for (cid:2) 1A is not sufﬁcient for targeting the ﬁl - amin - B var - 1 construct to focal contacts . Interestingly , the simultaneous deletion of the H1 region is required for the localization of ﬁlamin - B at the tips of actin stress ﬁbers . When expressed in C2C12 cells , ﬁlamin - B var - 1 ( (cid:3) H1 ) accel - erates their differentiation into myotubes . Furthermore , ﬁlamin - B variants lacking the H1 region induce the formation of thinner myotubes than those in cells containing variants with this region . These ﬁndings suggest that speciﬁc combinations of ﬁlamin mRNA splicing events modulate the organization of the actin cytoskeleton and the binding afﬁnity for integrins . Introduction Filamins are (cid:2) 560 - kD dimeric proteins that , based on their conserved actin - binding domain ( ABD ) * and actin cross - linking activities , belong , similar to (cid:4) - actinin , spectrin , and dystrophin , to the family of actin - binding proteins . Filamins organize filamentous actin ( F - actin ) into either orthogonal networks or parallel bundles , depending on the relative ac - tin / filamin ratio and the source of purified filamin . In hu - mans three filamin isogenes have been identified : FLNA , FLNB , and FLNC ( Stossel et al . , 2001 ; van der Flier and Sonnenberg , 2001a ) . Filamin - A is also named ABP - 280 ( Gorlin et al . , 1990 ) or filamin - 1 , and filamin - B is also named ABP - 278 / 276 ( Xu et al . , 1998 ) , (cid:2) - filamin ( Takafuta et al . , 1998 ) , or filamin - 3 . Filamin - C has been cloned as (cid:5) - filamin , ABPL ( Xie et al . , 1998 ) , or filamin - 2 ( Thompson et al . , 2000 ) . The first (cid:2) 275 NH 2 - terminal amino acids of filamin con - tain an ABD , composed of two calponin homology do - mains . This domain is followed by 24 repetitive , 100 - resi - due segments , interrupted by two (cid:2) 30 – amino acid flexible loops ( hinge - 1 [ H1 ] and - 2 ) , which show little homology among the products of the filamin isogenes . The H1 loop , between repeats 15 and 16 , is lacking in some splice variants of filamin - B and filamin - C ( Xie et al . , 1998 ; Xu et al . , 1998 ) . It has been suggested that in the dimeric filamin mol - ecule , the flexible H1 regions are essential for the separation of its ABDs and thus for its ability to promote orthogonal cross - linking of actin filaments ( Gorlin et al . , 1990 ) .

In addition to its ability to cross - link actin fila - ments , filamin - A serves as a docking site for various trans - membrane cell surface molecules such as GP - Ib (cid:4) , Fc - (cid:5) RI , tissue factor , and the (cid:2) 2 and (cid:2) 1A integrin subunits ( Ohta et al . , 1991 , 1999 ; Sharma et al . , 1995 ; Meyer et al . , 1997 ; Loo et al . , 1998 ; Pfaff et al . , 1998 ; Calderwood et al . , 1999 ) . Fil - amin - B binds to GP - Ib (cid:4) ( Takafuta et al . , 1998 ; Xu et al . , 1998 ) , whereas the muscle - associated filamin - C binds to sarcoglycans ( Thompson et al . , 2000 ) and a number of mus - cle - specific proteins ( Faulkner et al . , 2000 ; van der Ven et al . , 2000 ; Takada et al . , 2001 ) . Furthermore , intracellular signal transduction proteins , such as the small GTPases RalA , RhoA , Rac - 1 , Cdc42 ( Ohta et al . , 1999 ) , the guani - dine - exchange factor Trio ( Bellanger et al . , 2000 ) , the tumor necrosis factor receptor – associated factor - 2 ( Leonardi et al . , 2000 ) , and the membrane - associated proteases , furin and presenilin , bind to filamin ( Liu et al . , 1997 ; Zhang et al . , 1998 ) . These interactions point to a scaffolding function of filamin , rather than a distinct role as an actin filament – orga - nizing molecule . Analyses of melanocytic cell lines deficient in filamin - A ( Cunningham et al . , 1992 ) , as well as of pa - tients with the neuronal migration disorder periventricular heterotopia ( Fox et al . , 1998 ; Sheen et al . , 2001 ) , indicate a role for filamin - A in cell motility during stabilization of the cell membrane . However , relatively little is known about the specific roles of filamin variants in the properties of cells and the regulation of cellular processes . Integrins are heterodimeric adhesion receptors that pro - vide a structural link between proteins of the extracellular matrix ( e . g . , fibronectin , laminin , and collagen ) and the in - tracellular cytoskeleton ( Hynes , 1992 ; van der Flier and Sonnenberg , 2001b ) . In addition , integrins play a role in several different signaling events ( Giancotti and Ruoslahti , 1999 ) . Although the small ( 20 – 50 amino acids ) cytoplas - mic tails of the integrin (cid:4) and (cid:2) subunits have no intrinsic catalytic domains or obvious protein – protein interaction domains , studies combining biochemical and genetic ap - proaches , have led to the identification of a range of cy - toskeletal , adaptor , and signaling molecules , which interact with the integrin cytoplasmic tails and are therefore impli - cated in integrin function ( Liu et al . , 2000 ; van der Flier and Sonnenberg , 2001b ) . Cytoskeletal proteins , such as the actin cross - linking proteins talin , (cid:4) - actinin , and fil - amin - A ( Critchley , 2000 ) , interact with integrin (cid:2) sub - units . These molecules have been implicated in the linking of actin stress fibers to the cell membrane at specialized structures , known as focal adhesions or focal contacts , which are formed at cell – substrate contact sites . Binding to (cid:2) subunits of this class of proteins was originally shown in biochemical experiments and was recently confirmed in yeast two - hybrid assays ( Loo et al . , 1998 ) . Another cate - gory of proteins that interact with integrins are signaling molecules , including the ARF - GEF protein , cytohesin - 1 , the WD - repeat proteins Rack1 and WAIT - 1 , ICAP - 1 , and integrin - linked kinase ( Hannigan et al . , 1996 ; Kolanus et al . , 1996 ; Chang et al . , 1997 ; Liliental and Chang , 1998 ; Rietzler et al . , 1998 ) . This study originated with the desire to identify cytoplas - mic proteins that bind to the integrin (cid:2) 1D subunit , specifi - cally in cardiac and skeletal muscle . Using the yeast two - hybrid technique , we isolated a new splice variant of filamin - B . Characterization of the interactions in yeast two - hybrid analyses and biochemical assays indicated that this filamin variant has a high binding activity and a broad specificity for integrin (cid:2) subunits . Subsequent analysis of filamin mRNA splicing during in vitro myogenesis revealed that the H1 re - gion of filamin - B and filamin - C is removed during the dif - ferentiation of myoblasts . Transfection studies with different filamin - B variants tagged with green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) revealed that the interaction with integrins and the cellular localization of the various filamin variants is differ - ent , and they affect myotube morphology and the pace of in vitro myogenesis of C2C12 cells in a variant - specific manner . Results A novel filamin - B splice variant interacts with the (cid:2) 1D integrin subunit in yeast To identify proteins that interact with the cytoplasmic do - main of (cid:2) 1D , specific for cardiac and skeletal muscle , we screened a human skeletal muscle cDNA library for interact - ing clones , using the (cid:2) 1D cytoplasmic domain as bait in a yeast two - hybrid screen . Approximately 6 (cid:6) 10 6 clones were screened . From 67 positive clones , two identical clones en - coding the 5 COOH - terminal repeats of filamin - B ( amino acids 2027 – 2602 ) were isolated . Strikingly , in both filamin - B clones , 41 amino acids were deleted from the region be - tween filamin repeats 19 and 20 ( residues 2082 – 2122 ) . This filamin variant was named filamin - B var - 1 . In a yeast two - hybrid screen for clones interacting with (cid:2) 1A , using a hu - man keratinocyte cDNA library ( 29 (cid:6) 10 6 clones ) , we iso - lated , from 16 positive clones , 4 identical filamin - B var - 1 clones . The other isolated clones encoded either false posi - tives or will be described elsewhere . Additionally , a filamin - B var - 1 clone encoding EST was published under GenBank / EMBL / DDBJ accession no . W40525 ( pancreatic islets ) . These results show that filamin - B var - 1 binds to the cytoplas - mic domains of both (cid:2) 1A and (cid:2) 1D , and the expression of filamin - B var - 1 is not restricted to skeletal muscle . Expression and genomic determination of novel filamin - B splice variants To explore the expression pattern of the transcript for fil - amin - B var - 1 , cDNAs of multiple human tissues were analyzed in a PCR reaction , using primers that flank repeats 19 and 20 of filamin - B . Fig . 1 A shows that the cDNA encoding the previously reported filamin - B wild - type sequence was ampli - fied from all tissues tested ( 683 - bp product ) . In addition , a smaller PCR product of 560 bp , corresponding to the fil - amin - B var - 1 specific part , was detectable in heart , lung , and skeletal muscle . Nested PCR analysis revealed a weak expres - sion of filamin - B var - 1 in all tissues tested ( unpublished data ) . A similar splice variant lacking the corresponding region ( amino acids 2127 – 2167 ) in human filamin - A , filamin - A var - 1 , was also detected by ( nested ) PCR analysis ( unpublished Integrin binding to filamin isoforms and variants | van der Flier et al . 363 data ) . Two additional filamin - B – specific PCR products of 830 ( filamin - B var - 2 ) and 753 bp ( filamin - B var - 3 ) were detected in cardiac tissue ( Fig . 1 A ) . Cloning and sequencing of these PCR fragments revealed that they represent two partially overlapping cardiac filamin - B cDNAs ( Fig . 1 B ) . Intrigu - ingly , in filamin - B var - 2 , the insertion of a 147 - bp sequence results in a truncated protein with a unique COOH - termi - nal sequence of 24 amino acids . The insertion in filamin - B var - 3 of only the first 70 of the 147 bp inserted in filamin - B var - 2 leads to a frameshift , and as a result , four more amino acids are encoded COOH - terminally in this protein . Hence , both cardiac - specific filamin - B transcripts encode truncated filamin - B proteins that lack the four COOH - terminal re - peats , including the 24th dimerization domain . Genomic PCR mapping with primers designed from ex - ons 39 and 41 , encoding the filamin repeats 19 and 20 ( Fig . 1 , C and D ) , revealed that the stretch of 41 amino acids , de - leted in filamin - B var - 1 , is encoded by a single exon of 123 bp . This exon is preceded by a 102 - bp intron and followed by an intron of (cid:2) 2 . 5 kb . Furthermore , we found that the cDNA sequence of filamin - B var - 2 , specific for heart , is en - coded by a 147 - bp exon , exon 40B / C . Alternative RNA splicing at the internal splice site , located in exon 40B / C , produces the filamin - B var - 3 transcript . Filamin isoforms and their variants determine specificity for association with (cid:2) subunits We next tested the interaction of the COOH - terminal do - main , i . e . , repeats 19 – 24 of filamin - B and filamin - B var - 1 with different (cid:2) subunits , using the yeast two - hybrid system . In addition , we tested the homologous regions of filamin - A and filamin - A var - 1 . The results ( Fig . 2 A ) show that the COOH - terminal domain of wild - type filamin - B ( 19 – 24 ) , containing repeats 19 – 24 , interacts only with (cid:2) 1A . In contrast , an equivalent construct encoding filamin - B var - 1 ( 19 – 24 ) , which lacks amino acids 2082 – 2122 that span repeats 19 and 20 , and an NH 2 - terminal deletion mutant of filamin - B , trun - cated at amino acid 2123 ( filamin - B , 20 * – 24 ) , bind not only to (cid:2) 1A but also to the (cid:2) 1D , (cid:2) 3 , and (cid:2) 6 subunits .

Quantitative (cid:2) - galactosidase ac - tivity assays indicated that filamin - B var - 1 ( 19 – 24 ) bound two to three times more strongly to (cid:2) 1A than did wild - type fil - amin - B ( 19 – 24 ) ( Fig . 2 B ) . The binding of filamin - B var - 1 ( 19 – 24 ) to (cid:2) 3 was weaker and comparable to that of wild - type filamin - B ( 19 – 24 ) to (cid:2) 1A , and that of filamin - B var - 1 ( 19 – 24 ) to (cid:2) 1D was of intermediate strength . In contrast to filamin - B ( 19 – 24 ) , the corresponding fil - amin - A ( 19 – 24 ) construct did not bind to (cid:2) 1A or any other (cid:2) subunit . However , filamin - A var - 1 ( 19 – 24 ) and the shorter filamin - A ( 20 * – 24 ) construct ( amino acids 2168 – 2647 ) in - teracted strongly with (cid:2) 1A and weakly with (cid:2) 3 and (cid:2) 6 , but neither of them interacted with (cid:2) 1D . None of the afore - mentioned filamin constructs interacted with the (cid:2) 2 cyto - plasmic domain ( unpublished data ) . Taken together , these data show that the affinity of filamin - B for (cid:2) 1A is strongly increased when the stretch of 41 amino acids is deleted from it . Similarly , the removal of the same region from filamin - A induces binding to (cid:2) 1A . Furthermore , both variants become capable of binding to other integrin (cid:2) subunits . Analysis of a series of filamin - B constructs truncated at the NH 2 or COOH terminus indicates that repeat 21 is neces - sary , but not sufficient , for interaction with (cid:2) 1A ( Fig . 2 A ) . It is possible that the presence of repeat 24 facilitates the dimerization of filamin , and thus of repeat 21 , thereby greatly increasing the strength of the binding to (cid:2) 1A . The interaction of filamin - B var - 1 with (cid:2) 3 and (cid:2) 6 was abolished by the deletion of repeats 23 – 24 , whereas it did not affect binding to (cid:2) 1A or (cid:2) 1D . Interactions of both (cid:2) 1A and (cid:2) 1D with filamin - B var - 1 ( 19 and 20 ) could still be demonstrated , although the binding appeared to be weaker than that of a construct containing repeat 21 , filamin - B var - 1 ( 19 – 21 ) . These data suggest that deletion of the 41 – amino acid region in fil - amin - B leads to either the removal of inhibitory sequences in repeat 19 or to the introduction of a new binding site for (cid:2) 1A and (cid:2) 1D in the remaining part of repeat 20 ( amino ac - ids 1995 – 2185 ) . The presence of repeat 21 increases bind - ing activity , which is consistent with the data showing that this repeat is necessary for efficient binding of filamin - B to (cid:2) 1A and contributes to the binding activity of filamin - B var - 1 ( 19 – 21 ) to (cid:2) 1 integrins .

Integrin binding to filamin isoforms and variants | van der Flier et al . 365 of filamin - B to (cid:2) 1A , binding of filamin - B var - 1 to (cid:2) 3 and (cid:2) 6 probably requires dimerization mediated by repeat 24 . Biochemical interaction of filamin variants with integrins To confirm the interactions between the different filamin splice variants and the (cid:2) 1A and (cid:2) 1D subunits observed in yeast , we expressed the regions containing repeats 19 – 24 of filamin - A var - 1 or filamin - B var - 1 , or the corresponding regions of wild - type filamin - A ( 19 – 24 ) or filamin - B ( 19 – 24 ) , in COS - 7 cells . The proteins were tagged at their NH 2 termi - nus with hemagglutinin A ( HA ) and expression of equiva - lent amounts of proteins in COS - 7 cells was confirmed by immunoblotting with anti - HA antibody ( Fig . 3 A ) . Binding of the filamin constructs to (cid:2) 1A and (cid:2) 1D was tested in a pull - down assay using glutathione - S - transferase ( GST ) fu - sion proteins containing the cytoplasmic domains of these integrin subunits , immobilized on glutathione - Sepharose beads ( Fig . 3 B ) . As shown in Fig . 3 C , GST – (cid:2) 1A bound to filamin - A var - 1 ( 19 – 24 ) and filamin - B var - 1 ( 19 – 24 ) , but not to the corresponding fragments of the wild - type filamin iso - forms ( filamin - A , 19 – 24 , and filamin - B , 19 – 24 ) . Binding of GST – (cid:2) 1D to the different filamin - A and filamin - B con - structs was either undetectable or very weak . The interaction between (cid:2) 1A and filamin - B ( 19 – 24 ) detected in yeast could not be confirmed in the pull - down assay , probably because it is too weak . Interestingly , we found that a truncated fil - amin - B construct that lacks the first 14 amino acids of re - peat 19 ( filamin - B , 2009 – 2602 ) could be efficiently precipi - tated with GST – (cid:2) 1A ( unpublished data ) . Thus , it appears that not only the deletion of COOH - terminal residues of re - peat 19 , as in the variant - 1 protein , but also the deletion of NH 2 - terminal residues of repeat 19 results in stronger bind - ing of filamin - B to (cid:2) 1A . Together , these data suggest that repeat 19 contains an inhibitory element for binding of fil - amin - B to (cid:2) subunits . Identification of the binding sites for filamins on (cid:2) 1A and (cid:2) 1D Next , we determined the binding sites for filamin - B and the splice variants of filamin - A and filamin - B on the cytoplas - mic domains of the (cid:2) 1A and (cid:2) 1D subunits ( Fig . 4 ) . Swap - ping the COOH - terminal residues of (cid:2) 1A and (cid:2) 1D in (cid:2) 1A / D 796 ( EGK to GRKAGL ) and (cid:2) 1A / D 792 ( NPKYEGK to NPNYGRAGL ) had no effect on their binding to fil - amin - B ( 19 – 24 ) , filamin - B var - 1 ( 19 – 24 ) , and filamin - A ( 20 – 24 ) . A swap involving the membrane - proximal region of (cid:2) 1D , where the G 778 and A 786 residues in (cid:2) 1A are replaced by the corresponding Q 778 and P 786 residues from (cid:2) 1D , leads to complete abolition of the interaction with filamin - B ( 19 – 24 ) and filamin - A ( 20 * – 24 ) . Binding of filamin - B var - 1 ( 19 – 24 ) could still be detected , although it was weaker . These results indicate that the specificity of the binding of filamin - B and filamin - A var - 1 with (cid:2) 1A depends on the two residues , G 778 and A 786 , that have been substituted in (cid:2) 1D by Q 778 and P 786 . Although a role for Q 778 cannot be ex - cluded , we propose that P 786 , by its ability to create a bend or a rigid kink in polypeptide chains , changes the conforma - tion of the (cid:2) 1D cytoplasmic domain in such a way that it can no longer bind to filamin - B or filamin - A var - 1 . Analysis of deletions of the cytoplasmic domain of (cid:2) 1A shows that for binding to filamin - B , almost the complete cy - toplasmic domain of (cid:2) 1A is required . Only the last 10 COOH - terminal amino acids of (cid:2) 1A can be deleted with - out causing a loss of interaction . The binding site for fil - amin - B var - 1 on (cid:2) 1A comprises both the NPXY motifs and the intervening sequence , whereas on (cid:2) 1D additional mem - brane proximal sequences are needed . Similarly , the minimal binding site for filamin - A ( 20 * – 24 ) on (cid:2) 1A comprises the two NPXY motifs and the intervening sequence , which re - sembles the binding site for filamin - B var - 1 . Thus , it appears that the binding site on (cid:2) 1A for the low - affinity interaction with filamin - B is distinct from the one mediating high - affin - ity binding to filamin - A var - 1 and filamin - B var - 1 . The sequence requirements for the binding of (cid:2) 1D to filamin - B var - 1 resem - Figure 3 . Binding of filamin isoforms and variants to GST – (cid:2) 1A and – (cid:2) 1D fusion proteins .

Alternative splicing of filamins during in vitro myogenesis During differentiation of mouse C2C12 myoblasts into myo - tubes , the expression of (cid:2) 1D is induced , whereas that of (cid:2) 1A is downregulated ( Belkin et al . , 1997 ; van der Flier et al . , 1997 ) . We investigated whether this switch is paralleled by changes in the expression of filamin isoforms and / or their variants . Total RNA was isolated at different time points of myogenic differentiation , and the expression of filamin iso - forms was analyzed by RT - PCR using appropriate primers . We studied the splicing of the region encoding the 41 amino acids in filamin - A and filamin - B , as well that of the H1 re - gion of filamin - A , filamin - B , and filamin - C ( Fig . 5 A ) . The latter were included because variants of human filamin - B and filamin - C , lacking the H1 region , have been described previously ( Xie et al . , 1998 ; Xu et al . , 1998 ) . Fig . 5 , B – D , shows that C2C12 myoblasts express all three murine fil - Figure 4 .

The conserved NPXY motifs are underlined and the amino acids in (cid:2) 1D that were swapped in the different chimeras are indicated by shading . The common membrane proximal region , which is shared between (cid:2) 1A and (cid:2) 1D , is boxed . Figure 5 . Expression of filamin isoforms and variants during in vitro myogenesis . ( A ) Schematic representation of the organization of the filamin domains and the regions analyzed by RT - PCR . ( B ) RT - PCR analysis of alternative splicing of the H1 region of filamin - A , filamin - B , and filamin - C in mouse C2C12 myoblasts and murine tissues , as indicated . Splicing is analyzed at the indicated time points after induction of differentiation . The H1 region of filamin - A is not spliced , whereas in filamin - B and filamin - C the H1 region is removed during myogenesis . Filamin - B ( H1s ) is detected in C2C12 cells and adult tissues . The switching from the (cid:2) 1A to the (cid:2) 1D variant during C2C12 differentiation is shown . ( C ) Immunoblot of the protein expression levels of filamin - B (cid:2) 1D , and MHC during myogenesis . Filamin - B expression decreases , while the myogenic differentiation markers (cid:2) 1D and MHC are both induced . ( D ) Amino acid alignment of the human and murine H1 and variable - 1 region . The partial murine filamin sequences are available from GenBank / EMBL / DDBJ under accession nos . AF353668 – 353670 . Integrin binding to filamin isoforms and variants | van der Flier et al . 367 amin isoforms . In addition , whereas the H1 region is present in filamin - A throughout differentiation , this region is absent from the filamin - B and filamin - C isoforms . This deletion appears to precede the switch from (cid:2) 1A to (cid:2) 1D that occurs during myogenic differentiation . Interestingly , we detected in C2C12 cells and among several murine and human cDNAs ( unpublished data ) a third filamin - B transcript that encodes a variant with a shorter H1 ( H1s ) region ( Fig . 5 D ) . This transcript arises as a result of the usage of intrinsic splice - donor and acceptor sites that are present in the murine and human filamin - B genes ( position 5280 and 5312 , respectively ; GenBank / EMBL / DDBJ accession no . NM _ 001457 ) . We did not detect the filamin - A var - 1 and fil - amin - B var - 1 transcripts . The expression of filamin - B proteins in C2C12 cells was assessed by immunoblotting with an antibody specific for the H1 region of filamin - B ( Fig . 5 C ) . In agreement with the PCR data , the level of filamin - B protein containing the H1 region decreased during the differentiation of C2C12 cells . In contrast , the expression of (cid:2) 1D and sarcomeric my - osin heavy chain ( MHC ) was induced in differentiating C2C12 cells . GFP COOH - terminal tags do not interfere with filamin dimerization Before initiating studies to define the cellular localization of the different splice variants of filamin - B , we examined whether the addition of GFP at the COOH terminus of filamin influences the ability of this protein to form dimers . To this end , a fil - amin - B ( 19 – 24 ) construct with GFP at the COOH - terminal end , and a control construct , tagged with HA at the NH 2 - ter - minal end , were transiently expressed in CHO cells . After 2 d , cell lysates and intact cells were treated with the chemical cross - linking reagent dithiobis - succinimidyl propionate ( DSP ) at two concentrations . As shown in Fig . 6 , the addition of in - creasing amounts of cross - linker led to a shift from monomeric to dimeric tagged filamins , as visualized by immunoblotting with antibodies against HA or GFP . The similar dimerization capacity of HA - and GFP - tagged filamin - B ( 19 – 24 ) indicates that the GFP tag had no effect on dimerization . The same sam - ples under reducing conditions , which disrupt the disulfide bond , only contained filamin monomers . Specificity of the cross - linking reaction was checked using the NH 2 - terminal HA - tagged filamin - B var - 1 ( 19 – 23 ) construct , which did not form dimers due to truncation of the COOH - terminal repeat 24 , which is required for dimerization . Subcellular distribution of full - length filamin - B variants and their interaction with (cid:2) 1 subunits After excluding potential disadvantageous effects of the GFP tag on the dimerization of filamin , we generated full - length cDNAs encoding four different filamin - B splice variants and tagged them with GFP ( Fig . 7 A ) . These include the previ - ously reported filamin - B and filamin - B lacking H1 ( filamin - B [ (cid:3) H1 ] ) , as well as the novel identified filamin - B lacking the 41 residues between repeats 19 and 20 ( filamin - B var - 1 ) , and filamin - B var - 1 without H1 ( filamin - B var - 1 [ (cid:3) H1 ] ) . As shown in Fig . 7 B , the latter two filamin - B variants are ex - pressed in a variety of tissues and cell types , including heart , lung , testis , spleen , thymus , and leukocytes . Several cell types were retrovirally transduced , and after fluorescence - activated cell sorting for filamin - GFP – expressing cells , the stable ex - pression of the different filamin fusion proteins was verified by immunoblotting . In all cell lines , full - length GFP - tagged filamin - B variants migrating at (cid:2) 300 kD could be detected ( shown for C2C12 , Fig . 7 C ) . Filamin - B expression levels were consistently lower than those of the other variants , which were comparable to each other . Occasionally , smaller protein degradation products were detected , which varied in size and quantity , depending on the transduced cell line and the filamin variant ( Fig . 7 C ) . GST pull - down assays con - firmed that deletion of the variant - 1 region from full - length filamin - B increases binding to (cid:2) 1 integrins ( Fig . 7 D ) . Only the two filamin - B constructs , filamin - B var - 1 and filamin - B var - 1 ( (cid:3) H1 ) , in which the variant - 1 region had been deleted , but not filamin - B or filamin - B ( (cid:3) H1 ) , were precipitated by GST – (cid:2) 1A ( Fig . 7 D ) . Binding of filamin - B var - 1 and filamin - B var - 1 ( (cid:3) H1 ) to (cid:2) 1D again proved to be weak and could only be demonstrated after long exposures of the film . None of the filamin - B constructs interacted with GST . The subcellular distribution of the different GFP - tagged filamin - B variants was examined in GD25 - (cid:2) 1A mouse fibro - blasts stably expressing these proteins . The localization of GFP - tagged filamin - B ( Fig . 8 , C and D ) was identical to that of endogenous filamin - B , as revealed by immunostaining us - ing an antibody against the H1 region of filamin - B ( Fig . 8 , A Figure 6 . The GFP tag on the COOH - terminal part of filamin - B does not interfere with dimerization in vivo . CHO cells were transfected with either the NH 2 - terminal HA - or the COOH - terminal GFP - tagged FLN - B ( 19 – 24 ) or with the NH 2 - terminal HA - tagged FLN - B var - 1 ( 19 – 23 ) construct lacking the last repeat . 2 d after transfection , filamin dimers in either cell lysates ( lysate ) or intact cells ( cells ) were stabilized by chemical cross - linking at two different concentrations of DSP for 1 h , and dimerization of the epitope - tagged filamins was analyzed by immunoblotting under nonreducing conditions ( NR ) using anti - HA and anti - GFP antibodies . The specificity of the cross - linkage was checked by including NH 2 - terminal HA - tagged FLN - B var - 1 ( 19 – 23 ) , in which the truncation of COOH - terminal repeat 24 abolished dimerization . In addition , cross - linked samples were separated under reducing ( R ) , DSP disrupting conditions resulting in the presence of filamin - B monomers . Closed arrowheads indicate HA - tagged products , and open arrow - heads indicate GFP - tagged fusion proteins . A single arrow indicates a filamin monomer , and an arrow doublet indicates dimers . 368 The Journal of Cell Biology | Volume 156 , Number 2 , 2002 and B ) . Thus , the GFP tag did not interfere with the normal localization of filamin - B . Filamin - B was localized at actin stress fibers but was not appreciably concentrated in focal contacts . The distribution of filamin - B ( (cid:3) H1 ) and filamin - B var - 1 variants was similar to that of filamin - B ( Fig . 8 , E and F ) . Interestingly , filamin - B var - 1 ( (cid:3) H1 ) was associated with a proportion of the peripheral focal contacts positive for vincu - lin ( Fig . 8 , G – O , and Fig . 9 E ) . There was also GFP fluores - cence in the nucleus in many of these cells , the significance of which is unknown . As anticipated , the filamin - B var - 1 ( (cid:3) H1 ) variant did not react with anti – filamin - B H1 antibody . How - ever , its presence in focal contacts was revealed by GFP fluo - rescence , whereas endogenous filamin - B , which does react with this antibody , was found associated with actin stress fi - bers ( Fig . 8 , M – O ) . Neither endogenous filamin - B ( Fig . 8 B ) nor any of the filamin - B variants ( unpublished data ) were en - riched in lamellipodia . The expression of filamin - B var - 1 ( (cid:3) H1 ) in focal contacts did not have an apparent effect on the com - position and localization of these structures . They were con - fined at the end of actin stress fibers ( Fig . 8 , J – L , and Fig . 9 F ) and in addition to vinculin , they contained talin , phospho - tyrosine , and paxillin ( Fig . 9 , A , B , and D ) . We did not detect (cid:4) - actinin in focal contacts ( Fig . 9 C ) . Lastly , in GD25 - (cid:2) 1D cells expressing filamin - B var - 1 ( (cid:3) H1 ) there was also a promi - nent staining of some focal contacts ( unpublished data ) . We conclude that the localization of filamin - B var - 1 ( (cid:3) H1 ) in focal contacts requires , in addition to the characterized variant - 1 high - affinity binding site for (cid:2) 1 integrins , a func - tion that is induced by the loss of the H1 region . Filamin - B variants affect myoblast differentiation in vitro The functional significance of the developmentally regulated splicing of the H1 region in filamin - B , as well as the deletion Figure 7 .

( A ) Schematic presentation of COOH - terminal GFP - tagged filamin - B variant constructs . The internal deletions of filamin - B are indicated by a single line . ( B ) Detection by PCR amplification of filamin - B var - 1 and filamin - B var - 1 ( (cid:3) H1 ) transcripts . PCR was performed on cDNAs from different human tissues , using primers BV12 and BV13 ( A ) designed to specifically amplify filamin - B var - 1 ( (cid:8)(cid:3) H1 ) cDNAs . cDNAs encoding filamin - B variants with and without the var - 1 region were used as positive and negative controls , respectively . As a further negative control , cDNA for filamin - A was used . A PCR product for filamin - B var - 1 was amplified from most tissues . Heart , spleen , and thymus contained transcripts for filamin - B var - 1 ( (cid:3) H1 ) . A third PCR product ( indicated by an asterisk ) that migrated slightly faster than the filamin - B var - 1 variant and is present in heart , kidney , liver , lung , and colon , corresponds to filamin - B var - 1 ( H1s ) . The authenticity of the PCR products has been confirmed by sequencing . ( C ) Expression of GFP - tagged filamin - B variants in C2C12 myoblasts . Stably transduced C2C12 cells were obtained as described in the Materials and methods . Equal amounts of total cells lysed in boiling sample buffer were analyzed by immunoblotting . Filamin - B – GFP was detected by mouse anti - GFP antibody . The upper bands represent the full - length filamin – GFP fusion proteins whereas some fainter lower bands represent COOH - terminal proteolytic products . ( D ) Pull - down assay of full - length filamin - B variants with GST or GST – (cid:2) 1A and – (cid:2) 1D fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione beads containing GFP - tagged fusion proteins as indicated . Immunoblotting showed binding of filamin - B var - 1 and filamin - B var - 1 ( (cid:3) H1 ) to GST – (cid:2) 1A , weak binding to GST – (cid:2) 1D , whereas filamin - B and filamin - B ( (cid:3) H1 ) did not bind . Integrin binding to filamin isoforms and variants | van der Flier et al . 369 of the 41 – amino acid region , was explored by analyzing the effects of ectopic expression of the four different filamin - B splice variants on myogenesis of C2C12 cells . Myogenic dif - ferentiation was induced by switching the culture to a me - dium containing 2 % horse serum ( differentiation medium ) . Interestingly , C2C12 cells expressing filamin - B var - 1 ( (cid:3) H1 ) fused into myotubes within 2 to 3 d after the medium switch , which is 1 – 2 d earlier than the fusing of cells from the other transduced cell lines ( Fig . 10 A ) . Furthermore , the myotubes formed by the cells expressing the filamin - B vari - ants lacking the H1 region ( filamin - B [ (cid:3) H1 ] and filamin - B var - 1 [ (cid:3) H1 ] ) were thinner than those formed by the other transduced cell lines or GFP control cells . This difference in morphology was more obvious when the myotubes were stained for MHC ( Figs . 11 and 12 ) . In the differentiating myotubes , filamin - B , filamin - B var - 1 , and filamin - B ( (cid:3) H1 ) were localized diffusely throughout the cytoplasm , with regions of enrichment at the longitudinal actin stress fibers ( Fig . 11 , B and E ) . In contrast , the local - ization of filamin - B var - 1 ( (cid:3) H1 ) was typically polarized and dotted at the periphery of tubes ( Fig . 11 , C and F ) . GFP alone was mainly localized in the nucleus ( Fig . 11 , A and D ) . Occasionally , depending on the culture conditions , in well - differentiated tubes with clear sarcomeric organization , filamin - B was localized at the Z - lines , as shown by costain - ing for sarcomeric (cid:4) - actinin , and at intermediate M - bands ( Fig . 12 , E and F ) . Immunoblot analysis of MHC demonstrated that the morphological differentiation is accompanied by bio - chemical changes . The induction of MHC in the filamin - B var - 1 ( (cid:3) H1 ) – expressing C2C12 cells was faster than in the other cells , where the induction was similar to that in GFP control cells ( Fig . 10 B ) . Taken together , these re - sults show that expression of the filamin - double variant , filamin - B var - 1 ( (cid:3) H1 ) , accelerates muscle differentiation in vitro . Figure 8 . Expression and localization of filamin - B variants in GD25 – (cid:2) 1A mouse fibroblasts . GD25 – (cid:2) 1A cells ( A and B ) and GD25 – (cid:2) 1A cells stably expressing GFP - tagged filamin - B ( C and D ) , filamin - B var - 1 ( E ) , or filamin - B var - 1 ( (cid:3) H1 ) ( F – O ) , were analyzed for endogenous filamin - B ( A , B , and M ) and vinculin ( A , D – G , and I ) expression using indirect immunofluorescence microscopy , staining of F - actin ( B , C , J , and L ) with Alexa ® 568 - phalloidin , and GFP fluorescence ( C – F , H , I , K , and N ) . Filamin - B and the variants filamin - B var - 1 and filamin - B ( (cid:3) H1 ) are associated with actin stress fibers : they did not accumulate in focal contacts . In contrast , filamin - B var - 1 ( (cid:3) H1 ) is concentrated in focal contacts ( G – I ) at the end of actin stress fibers ( J – L , N , and O ) . Note that the fluorescence pattern of filamin - B – GFP is similar to that of endogenous filamin - B detected with a polyclonal antibody specific for the H1 region of this filamin isoform . This antibody does not react with filamin - B ( (cid:3) H1 ) and therefore in cells that express this variant , it does not react with focal contacts . Filamin - B is not present in membrane ruffles ( B , arrow ) . Bars , 10 (cid:11) m . 370 The Journal of Cell Biology | Volume 156 , Number 2 , 2002 Discussion In the present study , we have identified novel distinct splice variants produced by the filamin - A and filamin - B genes , and report on functional differences between filamin isoforms and their variants . We found that the deletion of 41 amino acids encoded by exon 40 from filamin - A and filamin - B , which generates the variants filamin - A var - 1 and filamin - B var - 1 , greatly influences their interaction with integrin (cid:2) subunits . The role of two additional heart - specific filamin - B variants , filamin - B var - 2 and filamin - B var - 3 , which lack the last four re - peated sequences of filamin - B , including the putative dimer - ization domain , remains elusive . COOH - terminal truncated filamin variants of Drosophila filamin - 240 have also been re - ported ( Li et al . , 1999b ; Sokol and Cooley , 1999 ; Guo et al . , 2000 ) . Furthermore , the recent identification of truncated variants of several other high molecular weight proteins that cross - link actin : i . e . , dystropin / utrophin , dystonin , and plec - tin ( Fuchs and Yang , 1999 ; Blake and Kroger , 2000 ; Zuellig et al . , 2000 ) , raises the interesting possibility that these vari - ants play an unprecedented role in the regulation of actin dynamics and the modification of F - actin organization . Finally , analysis of the splicing of mRNAs for filamins during in vitro myogenesis of C2C12 cells revealed that the H1 region of filamin - B and filamin - C is removed during myotube formation . The biological consequences of these modifications are discussed below . Specific interactions of filamin variants The novel filamin - B variant , filamin - B var - 1 , is the fourth re - ported (cid:2) 1D - binding protein identified in a yeast two - hybrid scree ; the other three are MIBP , melusin , and skelemin ( Reddy et al . , 1998 ; Brancaccio et al . , 1999 ; Li et al . , 1999a ) . The yeast two - hybrid interaction assays indicated that fil - amin - A does not bind to any integrin (cid:2) subunit , whereas fil - amin - B only interacts with (cid:2) 1A . On the contrary , the splice Figure 9 . Localization of filamin - B var - 1 ( (cid:3) H1 ) in focal contacts .

Integrin binding to filamin isoforms and variants | van der Flier et al . 371 variants filamin - A var - 1 and filamin - B var - 1 bind strongly to (cid:2) 1A and weakly to (cid:2) 3 and (cid:2) 6 . Additionally , a moderate binding of filamin - B var - 1 to (cid:2) 1D was observed . These results provide evidence that isoforms and variants of filamins specifically bind to different integrin (cid:2) subunits , which render the inter - pretation of biochemical studies with filamins more compli - cated . Furthermore , subcellular localization and morphologi - cal and myogenic effects were found to be determined by the type of the expressed filamin variant . Previously , it has been shown by coimmunoprecipitation and pull - down assays that various integrin (cid:2) subunits have different capacities to bind cytoskeletal proteins . The results Figure 11 .

In addition , the affinity of the (cid:2) 7 integrin subunit for filamin appeared to be high , whereas that of (cid:2) 1A and (cid:2) 1D was found to be intermediate and low , respectively ( Pfaff et al . , 1998 ; Zent et al . , 2000 ) . Our data suggest that (cid:2) 1 integrins hardly interact with fil - amin - A or filamin - B and that most of their binding activity toward these filamin isoforms is with the variant - 1 forms . In agreement with previous findings , we observed that the binding of (cid:2) 1A to filamin - A var - 1 and filamin - B var - 1 is stronger than that of (cid:2) 1D . Loo et al . ( 1998 ) has previously reported that filamin - A can interact with the cytoplasmic domain of (cid:2) 1A . However , their conclusion was based on the binding of (cid:2) 1A to a construct containing the COOH - terminal 478 amino acids of filamin - A . This fragment corresponds to fil - amin - A ( 20 * – 24 ) , whose binding properties resemble those of filamin - A var - 1 . However , a longer filamin - A protein , ex - tending 176 amino acids at the NH 2 terminus , does not bind to integrin (cid:2) subunits . Thus , the apparent discrepan - cies between these reported data and ours might be due to the fact that those studies were concerned with the interac - tion of (cid:2) 1A with a splice variant of filamin - A rather than with wild - type filamin - A . Similarly , the filamin proteins previously identified in pull - down experiments using dimer - ized integrin cytoplasmic domains presumably do not repre - sent wild - type filamin , but filamin splice variants ( Pfaff et al . , 1998 ; Calderwood et al . , 1999 ) . The discrepancy between our pull - down interaction re - sults ( Fig . 3 ) and those of yeast two - hybrid assays ( Fig . 2 ) on the interaction of filamin - B variants with (cid:2) 1D probably can be reduced to a difference in sensitivity between these two assays ; the yeast two - hybrid assay being more sensitive than the pull - down assay . Indeed , we found in the (cid:2) - galactosi - dase assays that binding of (cid:2) 1D to filamin - B var - 1 is weaker than that of (cid:2) 1A . An alternative explanation might be that in the GST – (cid:2) 1D fusion protein , the (cid:2) 1D cytoplasmic se - quences are not readily accessible for binding . Based on the immunoglobulin - like folding of several fil - amin repeats that are present in the gelation factor of Dic - tyostelium ( Fucini et al . , 1997 ; McCoy et al . , 1999 ) , it is likely that as a result of the 41 – amino acid deletion , three (cid:2) - strands of the two adjacent repeats 19 and 20 ( strand G from repeat 19 and strands A and B from repeat 20 ) were lacking in the filamin - A and filamin - B variants . Removal of this stretch of 41 amino acids probably led to the exposure of one or more cryptic binding sites for integrin (cid:2) subunits in the remaining part of repeat 20 of filamin - A and filamin - B . Alternatively , the disruption of repeat 19 may have re - moved elements inhibiting the binding of filamin - B to (cid:2) 1A . Finally , together with the deleted 41 amino acids in hu - man filamin - B var - 1 , a conserved cAMP - kinase consensus site ( serine 2150 ) was removed that , when phosphorylated in fil - amin - A , confers an increased resistance to calpain cleavage at residues 1761 – 1762 in the H1 region ( Gorlin et al . , 1990 ; Jay et al . , 2000 ) . This suggests long - range conformational effects by the 19 and 20 repeat region of filamin and , al - though serine 2150 is not conserved in murine filamin - B , deletion of this region may have additional effects beyond the modulation of the strength and specificity of filamin - (cid:2) – integrin interactions . Interestingly , filamin - C contains an insertion of 82 amino acids , exactly juxtaposed to the ho - mologous variant - 1 region , which could give specific fea - tures to this filamin variant associated with striated muscle ( Thompson et al . , 2000 ) . Evidence of alternative splicing of mRNA has not yet been reported for this region ( Xie et al . , 1998 ) . Specialized cellular roles and specific cellular localization of filamin - B variants Several previous reports have indicated complex expression patterns of filamin variants during myogenesis ( Gomer and Lazarides , 1981 , 1983a , b ; Chiang et al . , 2000 ) . In this study , we extended those data by the identification of ad - ditional filamin - B var and H1 splice variants . We demon - strate that removal of the H1 region from filamin - B and filamin - C is induced during myogenesis in vitro . Further - more , the presence or absence of the H1 region in fila - min - B affects the morphology of the formed myotubes . Filamin - B variants lacking H1 form thinner myotubes in contrast to the more pouch - like tubes formed by H1 - con - taining filamins . Deletion of the H1 region from both filamin - B and fil - amin - C might determine the type of actin filaments with which these filamin isoforms interact . This would explain why during differentiation of myoblasts into myotubes , a process that is associated with a dramatic reorganization of the cytoskeleton , the splicing of the mRNA for this region is regulated and why forced expression of it has such a dra - matic effect on the morphology of the formed myotubes . Parallel bundles of actin filaments might become more tightly packed by the loss of the H1 region of filamin , be - cause the flexibility of the filamin dimer lacking the H1 re - gion is reduced , as has been anticipated by Gorlin et al . ( 1990 ) . Our observation that filamin - B variants lacking the H1 region show the tendency to be more polarized at the ends of actin stress fibers supports this hypothesis . The iden - tification of shorter filamin - B ( (cid:3) H1s ) alternative splice vari - ants in several murine and human tissues provides additional possibilities for the modulation of the H1 region , and subse - quent effects on the organization of the F - actin network . Indeed , several studies have shown the effects of differ - ences in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton on myoblast morphology and differentiation . For example , ex - pression of dystrophin , or its homologue utrophin , in dys - trophin - deficient mdx mice affects the type of fibers present in muscle ( Rafael et al . , 2000 ) . Also , RhoA - mediated induc - tion of stress fibers increases myoblast differentiation , in contrast to the inhibitory effects on myogenesis by Rac - 1 and Ras ( Wei et al . , 1998 ; Gallo et al . , 1999 ) . By transfecting filamin - B variants into cells , it was shown that the colocalization of filamin with (cid:2) 1 - integrin – contain - ing focal adhesions is not solely dependent on the presence of an integrin - binding site on filamin - B var - 1 . Only the fil - amin - B var - 1 ( (cid:3) H1 ) variant , in which a high affinity binding site for (cid:2) 1A and (cid:2) 1D is combined with the absence of the H1 region , is concentrated at the tips of actin stress fibers , where it is colocalized with (cid:2) 1 integrins . Two previously de - scribed chicken filamin variants could resemble filamin - Integrin binding to filamin isoforms and variants | van der Flier et al . 373 B var - 1 ( (cid:3) H1 ) ( Pavalko et al . , 1989 ; Tachikawa et al . , 1997 ) , because of their localization at the ends of stress fibers in fo - cal adhesions or at the dense plaques in smooth muscle cells . It is possible that the effect induced by the loss of the H1 re - gion permits the linkage of filamin - B var - 1 ( (cid:3) H1 ) with special organized actin stress fibers in focal contacts , thereby facili - tating binding of the variant - 1 site to integrins . However , there are other possible explanations , e . g . , similar to the de - letion of the var - 1 region , the deletion of the H1 region may have induced a binding site for one or more focal contact proteins that , together with (cid:2) 1 , mediate the localization of filamin - B var - 1 ( (cid:3) H1 ) in focal contacts . Our finding that filamin - B var - 1 ( (cid:3) H1 ) is present together with talin in focal contacts raises the question of which of these two proteins is actually associated with (cid:2) 1 . Filamin - B var - 1 ( (cid:3) H1 ) and talin bind to overlapping sites on the (cid:2) 1 cy - toplasmic domain and , therefore , it seems unlikely that these two proteins simultaneously bind to (cid:2) 1 . We believe it is rea - sonable to assume that a proportion of (cid:2) 1 is associated with talin , whereas other (cid:2) 1 subunits interact with filamin - B var - 1 ( (cid:3) H1 ) . An alternative possibility , which we consider to be less likely , but nevertheless cannot formally be excluded , is that only filamin - B var - 1 ( (cid:3) H1 ) is associated with (cid:2) 1 and talin is retained in focal contacts by an interaction with vinculin . Previous reports have indicated a critical role for integrins in myogenic differentiation ( Menko and Boettiger , 1987 ; Sastry et al . , 1996 ) and muscle integrity ( Volk et al . , 1990 ; Mayer et al . , 1997 ; Hayashi et al . , 1998 ) . Conceivably , the acceleration of myogenesis observed in C2C12 cells express - ing filamin - B var - 1 ( (cid:3) H1 ) might be due to an altered interac - tion of this filamin variant with the (cid:2) 1 integrins . An in - creased interaction may help to stabilize the expression of integrins at the cell surface by firmly anchoring them to the actin cytoskeleton . For example , the reexpression of fila - min - A , in filamin - A – deficient melanoma cells , has been as - sociated with an increase in the surface levels of both the GP - Ib (cid:4) and (cid:2) 1 integrins ( Meyer et al . , 1998 ) . However , we did not detect , by FACS ® analysis , any changes in surface expression levels of (cid:2) 1 integrins upon the ectopic expression of filamin - B variants ( unpublished data ) . This discrepancy could be due to the complete lack of filamin - A in the M2 cells used by Meyer et al . ( 1998 ) . If cells contain endogenous filamin , the ectopic expression of filamin has no detectable effects . The effects of filamin - B var - 1 ( (cid:3) H1 ) on myogenesis may also be the consequence of a different localization and / or function of integrins in C2C12 cells . Indeed , as already mentioned , the distribution of filamin - B var - 1 ( (cid:3) H1 ) is typi - cally polarized in differentiating C2C12 cells and is localized together with (cid:2) 1 in focal contacts in GD25 - (cid:2) 1A cells . However , whatever the underlying mechanism for the effect of filamin - B var - 1 ( (cid:3) H1 ) on myogenesis is , the physiological significance of it remains uncertain , because it could not be demonstrated that this variant is expressed in C2C12 cells . In conclusion , our study provides the first evidence that alternative mRNA splicing controls the cellular localization of filamins and their interaction with integrins . This indi - cates that individual filamin variants could be specialized in linking integrins or other transmembrane proteins to the actin cytoskeleton , comparable to the filamin - C – specific ( Thompson et al . , 2000 ) and dystrophin - mediated connec - tion with the sarcoglycan adhesion complex in muscle cells . Ultimately , these specific activities of filamin variants modu - late cell morphology and differentiation . Materials and methods Cell lines and antibodies CHO cells were grown in DME supplemented with 10 % FCS and 1 % non - essential amino acids . Murine GD25 fibroblasts , lacking the endogenous (cid:2) 1 integrin subunit , were a gift of Dr . R . Fässler ( Lund University Hospital , Lund , Sweden ; Fässler et al . , 1995 ) . GD25 - (cid:2) 1A or GD25 - (cid:2) 1D cell lines were generated by retroviral transduction of GD25 cells with cDNA con - structs for human (cid:2) 1A or (cid:2) 1D , and maintained in DME supplemented with 10 % FCS , as described previously ( Gimond et al . , 1999 ) . The murine myo - blast cell line C2C12 ( American Type Culture Collection ; accession no . CRL 1772 ) was propagated in DME supplemented with 20 % FCS and high glucose ( 4 . 5 g / liter ) . Terminal differentiation of confluent C2C12 monolay - ers to multinuclear myotubes was induced by changing the culture me - dium to DME containing 2 % horse serum ( Yaffe and Saxel , 1977 ) . All me - dia were supplemented with penicillin and streptomycin . Retrovirally transduced cells were selected with 0 . 2 mg / ml zeocin ( Invitrogen ) . All cell lines were grown at 37 (cid:12) C in a humidified , 5 % CO 2 atmosphere . The mouse anti - vinculin ( V11F9 ) ( Glukhova et al . , 1990 ) was provided by Dr . M . Glukhova ( Institut Curie , Paris , France ) . The mouse anti - (cid:2) 1D cy - toplasmic domain ( 2B1 ) and rabbit anti – filamin - B ( H1 ) antibodies have been described previously ( van der Flier et al . , 1997 ; Takafuta et al . , 1998 ) . Mouse anti - sarcomeric (cid:4) - actinin ( EA - 53 ) , anti - talin ( 8d4 ) , and (cid:4) - actinin ( BM - 75 . 2 ) were purchased from Sigma - Aldrich ; mouse anti - paxillin ( 349 ) and anti - phosphotyrosine ( PY20 ) were from Transduction Laboratories ; mouse anti – Gal4 binding domain ( BD ) , mouse anti – Gal4 activation do - main ( AD ) , and rabbit anti - HA antibodies ( sc - 510 , sc - 1663 , and sc - 805 , respectively ) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Inc . ; mouse anti - HA ( 12CA5 ) were from Boehringer ; mouse anti - sarcomeric MHC ( MF20 ) were from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank ; and rabbit and mouse anti - GFP ( B34 ) were from CLONTECH Laboratories , Inc . and BabCO . The sheep anti – mouse and donkey anti – rabbit HRP - conjugated antibodies were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech . TO - PRO - 3 iodide , Al - exa ® - 568 – coupled phalloidin , and Texas red – conjugated goat anti – mouse and goat anti – rabbit were from Molecular Probes . Yeast two - hybrid screen and plasmid constructs The (cid:2) 1D ( amino acids 752 – 798 ) or (cid:2) 1A cytoplasmic domain ( amino acids 752 – 801 ) were fused to the Gal4 DNA BD in pAS2 . 1 ( CLONTECH Labora - tories , Inc . ) . These constructs were used as bait in yeast two - hybrid screens of a human skeletal muscle and a human keratinocyte library ( CLONTECH Laboratories , Inc . ; HL4010AB and HL4024AB , respectively ) in the yeast Gal4 transcriptional AD expression vector pGAD10 ( CLONTECH Labora - tories , Inc . ) . Plasmids were introduced into the yeast host strains PJ69 – 4A ( a gift from Dr . P . James , University of Wisconsin , Madison , WI ; James et al . , 1996 ) or Y190 ( CLONTECH Laboratories , Inc . ) by transformation . The yeast two - hybrid library screen was performed essentially according to the CLONTECH Laboratory , Inc . two - hybrid manual . To analyze the protein – protein interactions of truncated filamin - A and filamin - B with several integrin cytoplasmic tails , mutants , and truncated filamins , pACT ( - derived ) and pAS ( - derived ) constructs were cotrans - formed into the yeast strain PJ69 – 4A . Interaction was assayed by selection for growth on plates containing SC - LTHA , a yeast synthetic complete me - dium lacking the vector markers Leu and Trp , as well as the interaction markers His and Ade , and containing 2 mM 3 - aminotriazole ( Sigma - Aldrich ; A8056 ) to suppress residual histidine synthesis in the strain PJ69 – 4A , as described previously ( Geerts et al . , 1999 ) . Interaction was scored as the percentage of the plating efficiency on SC - LTHA containing 2 mM 3 - ami - notriazole compared with the plating efficiency on SC - LT , a medium lack - ing only the vector markers Leu and Trp , when grown for 5 or 10 d at 30 (cid:12) C . Quantitative determination of (cid:2) - galactosidase activities was per - formed in triplicate using of three independent clones grown in SC - LT with O - nitrophenyl B - D - galactopyranoside ( Sigma - Aldrich ) as the substrate , ac - cording to the manufacturer’s recommendations . All filamin - A and filamin - B deletion constructs ( starting at the amino ac - ids as indicated in Figs . 2 and 4 ; for amino acid alignment see van der Flier and Sonnenberg , 2001a ) were generated by PCR using Pwo DNA poly - merase ( Roche Molecular Biochemicals ) . Filamin - A and filamin - B deletion constructs were cloned in the modified yeast expression vector , pACT2 . 4 ( Gal - 4 [ AD ] , a derivative of pACT2 . 1 ) or pAS2 . 1 ( Gal4 [ BD ] ) . The Gal4 ( BD ) (cid:2) 1A , (cid:2) 1D , (cid:2) 2 , (cid:2) 3A cytoplasmic domain and (cid:2) 1A truncation constructs in 374 The Journal of Cell Biology | Volume 156 , Number 2 , 2002 the pAS2 . 1 have been described previously ( Wixler et al . , 2000 ) . The (cid:2) 6 cytoplasmic domain construct in pAS2 . 1 was a gift of S . Spong ( Lung Biol - ogy Center , University of California San Francisco , San Francisco , CA ) . The (cid:2) 1 chimeric cytoplasmic domains (cid:2) 1A / D 792 , (cid:2) 1A / D 796 , and (cid:2) 1D / A 787 were generated by PCR and cloned into pAS2 . 1 . All plasmid constructs were checked by sequencing , and the expression of fusion proteins in yeast was confirmed by immunoblotting with Gal4 ( BD ) - and ( AD ) - specific antibodies . None of the filamin constructs used activated the reporter genes autonomously in yeast , nor did they bind to any of several different integrin (cid:4) - subunits tested . Genomic PCR and RT - PCR analysis RT - PCR analysis was performed on Human Multiple Tissue cDNA Panel I and II ( CLONTECH Laboratories , Inc . ) using Taq DNA polymerase and primers deduced from the human filamin - B sequence . The following primer sets were used to detect the human filamin - B var - 1 cDNA : either BV1 / BV2 or nested PCR using primers BV9 / BV11 on the BV9 / BV10 PCR products . BV11 specifically amplifies the filamin - B var - 1 cDNA because it spans the 123 - nt deleted sequence with one basepair at its 3 (cid:13) end . Similarly , human filamin - A var - 1 was detected using the nested primers AV1 / AV3 on the AV1 / AV2 PCR product . Human filamin - B var - 1 ( (cid:3) H1 ) transcripts with or without the H1 region were detected using prim - ers BV12 / BV13 . Genomic sequences encoding repeats 19 and 20 of hu - man filamin - B were determined by PCR using Taq DNA polymerase on human genomic DNA isolated from two different cell lines , using a stan - dard procedure and combinations of the primers BV1 – BV8 as indicated in Fig . 1 C . All BV primers are numbered according to the filamin - B se - quence data available from GenBank / EMBL / DDBJ under accession no . NM _ 001457 , except primers BV7 and BV8 , which are numbered accord - ing to sequence data submitted under accession no . AF353666 .

Total RNA from C2C12 cells was isolated at various time points after myotube induction , using RNAzol™B ( Tel - Testine ) , as recommended by the manufacturer . Subsequently , cDNA was prepared from 10 (cid:11) g RNA us - ing an oligo d ( T ) 15 primer and SuperScript™ ( Life Technologies ) . The H1 regions of murine filamin - A , filamin - B , and filamin - C ( partial sequences are deposited under GenBank / EMBL / DDBJ accession nos . AF353668 , AF353669 , and AF354670 , respectively ) were amplified using the primer sets mAH1 / mAH2 , mBH1 / mBH2 , and mCH1 / mCH2 , respectively . mAH1 : CCTGATGGCTCAGAGGTAGA ( 1 – 20 ) ; mAH2 : GTGATCTCCCCTTCT - TGATA ( 344 – 324 ) ; mBH1 : CTGACGTCATTGAAAATGAAGAT ( 1 – 23 ) ; mBH2 : AATGGAATCACCAAGTCAAAGG ( 274 – 253 ) ; mCH1 : GATGG - GGCAGAGCTCGATG ( 1 – 19 ) ; mCH2 : GTCAGCTCCCCTTTCTGCAC ( 341 – 322 ) . For the detection of potential murine filamin - A and filamin - B variant - 1 mRNAs ( partial sequences are deposited under GenBank / EMBL / DDBJ ac - cession nos . AF353671 and AF353672 , respectively ) , RT - PCR was per - formed using mAV1 / mAV2 and mBV1 / mBV2 , respectively . The variant - 1 products were further amplified by nested PCR using the mAV1 / mAV3 and mBV1 / mBV3 primer sets on 1 (cid:11) l of the RT - PCR products . mAV1 : GGC - TACGGTGGGCTTAGTC ( 1 – 19 ) ; mAV2 : GAAGGGGCTCCCAGGTACA ( 453 – 435 ) ; mAV3 : TGACCAGCATGTGCCTG / A ( 138 – 154 / 278 ) ; mBV1 : AGGCTATGGTGGCATATCCT ( 1 – 20 ) ; mBV2 : GAACGGGCTTCCTGT - TACG ( 454 – 436 ) ; mBV3 : GCTGACGAGCATGTGCCTG / A ( 137 – 155 / 278 ) . Murine (cid:2) 1A and (cid:2) 1D integrin ( GenBank / EMBL / DDBJ accession no . Y00769 ) were analyzed using GGCAACAATGAAGCTATCG ( 2219 – 2237 ) and CCCTCATTCGGATTGAC ( 2484 – 2465 ) as a primer set . PCR products were analyzed on 2 % agarose gels and the identity of all PCR products was confirmed by cloning and subsequent sequencing . Cloning of HA - tagged and GFP fusion proteins Truncated forms of filamin - A and filamin - B were fused to the NH 2 - terminal HA epitope tag in pcDNA3 - HANII , a modified pcDNA3 vector ( Invitro - gen ) . pCI - puro - eGFPc was generated by inserting an eGFP PCR product , using pEGFP - N1 ( CLONTECH Laboratories , Inc . ) as a template , into pCI - puro ( (cid:3) XbaI / NotI ) , a pCI - neo – derived ( Promega ) vector in which the aminoglycoside phosphotransferase gene was replaced by the gene for puromycin - N - acetyl transferase , which induces puromycin resistance . LZRS - eGFPc - IRES - zeo was constructed by subcloning the eGFP fragment from pCI - puro - eGFPc into the retroviral expression vector LZRS - ms - IRES - zeo ( Kinsella and Nolan , 1996 ; van Leeuwen et al . , 1997 ) . The four fusion proteins of full - length filamin - B variants and GFP as depicted in Fig . 7 A were generated by a three point ligation into the XbaI / NotI sites of pCI - puro - eGFPc . All four possible combinations between one 5 (cid:13) filamin - B fragment ( XbaI / SacII ) , either containing or not containing the H1 region , and one 3 (cid:13) filamin - B fragment ( SacII / NotI ) , either wild - type or variant - 1 , were prepared . Retroviral expression constructs were obtained by reclon - ing the above filamin - B variants from pCI - puro - eGFP into the retroviral vector LZRS - eGFPc - ms - IRES - zeo . The 5 (cid:13) filamin - B fragment containing the H1 region was obtained by XbaI / SacII digestion of wild - type filamin - B ( Takafuta et al . , 1998 ) . A 3 (cid:13) filamin - B fragment containing a 3 (cid:13) NotI site for in - frame fusion with GFP was generated by PCR , using primer set D4 / U5 and full - length filamin - B as template . A 5 (cid:13) filamin - B fragment lacking H1 ( amino acids 1704 – 1727 ) was generated by fusion PCR . In brief , two PCR products were obtained using D1 / U1 and D2 / U2 primer pairs . Products were annealed through overlapping sequences ( underlined ) and reampli - fied with D1 / U2 to yield the H1 deletion . This PCR product was then used to replace the MunI / SacII fragment of wild - type filamin - B . A 3 (cid:13) fragment of filamin - B var - 1 , containing an intrinsic SacII and an in - frame 3 (cid:13) NotI site was generated by fusion PCR . One PCR product was obtained using primer set D4 / U4 and wild - type filamin - B as template . The other PCR product was obtained using primer set D5 / U5 and filamin - B var - 1 cDNA as template . The final fusion PCR product was obtained after reannealling the two obtained products and reamplification using primer set D4 / U5 . The primers used are under GenBank / EMBL / DDBJ accession no .

Binding to GST fusion proteins For pull - down assays , (cid:2) 1A and (cid:2) 1D cytoplasmic domains were fused with GST in the bacterial expression vector pRP261 , a derivative of the pGEX - 3X vector . The recombinant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 ( DE3 ) and purified from bacterial lysates by the use of glu - tathione - Sepharose 4B beads . Constructs encoding NH 2 - terminally trun - cated filamins were transfected in COS - 7 cells using the DEAE - dextran method ( two 10 - cm Petri dishes with 10 6 seeded cells were used for three pull - down assays ) . 48 h after transfection , cells were lysed for 20 min in 1 ml ice cold lysis buffer ( 10 mM Pipes , pH 6 . 8 , 50 mM NaCl , 150 mM su - crose , 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 , 1 mM EDTA , 10 (cid:11) g / ml calpeptin , 1 mM PMSF , 10 (cid:11) g / ml soybean trypsin inhibitor , 10 (cid:11) g / ml leupeptin , and 0 . 1 U / ml aprotinin ) . Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 15 , 000 g for 10 min at 4 (cid:12) C , and subsequently diluted 10 times in dilution buffer ( 10 mM Pipes , pH 6 . 8 , 50 mM NaCl , 150 mM sucrose , 3 mM MgCl 2 ) . Diluted lysates were incubated overnight at 4 (cid:12) C with 15 (cid:11) l glutathione - Sepharose 4B beads containing 50 (cid:11) g GST fusion proteins . The beads were washed with the same lysis buffer and centrifuged through a sucrose cushion ( 10 mM Pipes , pH 6 . 8 , 50 mM NaCl , 800 mM sucrose , 1 mM MgCl 2 ) , and proteins were resolved by SDS - PAGE and immunoblotted with anti - HA antibody . For GST precipitations of full - length COOH - terminally GFP - tagged fil - amins , stable retrovirally infected C2C12 or GD25 - (cid:2) 1A cells were lysed and incubated with the various GST fusion proteins . Expression of the full - length GFP - tagged filamin - B variants was increased by preincubating the cells overnight with 5 mM sodium butyrate . GST fusion protein loading of the beads was checked by Coomassie brilliant blue staining , and the fil - amin fusion proteins were visualized by immunoblotting , as described pre - viously ( Geerts et al . , 1999 ) . Chemical cross - linking of the HA - and eGFP - tagged filamin - B truncations and immunoblotting CHO cells were transfected with NH 2 - terminal HA - tagged or COOH - ter - minal GFP - tagged truncated constructs of full - length filamin - B ( FLN - B [ 19 – 24 ] 2009 – 2602 or FLN - B var - 1 [ 19 – 23 ] 2027 – 2047 ) , using a cationic lipid - based DNA delivery protocol ( Lipofectamin ; Life Technologies ) . After a 3 - h incu - bation , the lipofectamin reagent was replaced by fresh growth medium . 2 d Integrin binding to filamin isoforms and variants | van der Flier et al . 375 later , transfected cells were lysed in 0 . 5 ml lysis buffer ( 20 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 4 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 . 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 % Nonidet P - 40 ) for 5 min on ice and subsequently subjected to cross - linkage for 1 h on ice by adding dif - ferent concentrations ( 0 , 0 . 25 , or 1 mM ) of DSP ( Pierce Chemical Co . ; 25 mM stock in DMSO ) . Alternatively , the intact cell monolayer was treated with 1 mM of the cell - permeable cross - linker , dissolved in phosphate - buff - ered saline , for 1 h . Subsequently , the cross - linking reaction in the cell ly - sate was stopped by adding 25 (cid:11) l of 1 M Tris - HCl ( pH 6 . 8 ) , whereas the intact treated cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed in 50 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 150 mM NaCl , 1 % Nonidet P - 40 . All cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 14 , 000 rpm for 10 min and 1 / 12 portions of the total cell lysates were separated by SDS - PAGE on 7 % gels under both nonreducing and reducing ( 5 % (cid:2) - mercaptoethanol ) conditions and ana - lyzed by immunoblotting . Immunofluorescence and flow cytometry Bulk populations of sorted cells expressing GFP fusion proteins were grown on coverslips and , in one step , fixed and permeabilized in 3 % para - formaldehyde , 2 % Triton X - 100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature . Cells were blocked in PBS , 2 % BSA for 1 h , and incubated with primary antibodies ( optionally in the presence of Alexa ® 568 - labeled phalloidin or TO - PRO - 3 ) in the same buffer for 1 h at room temperature . After washing in PBS , cells were incubated in the presence of FITC - or Texas red – conju - gated secondary antibodies for 1 h . Preparations were then washed in PBS , mounted in Vectashield ( Vector Laboratories ) , and analyzed with a confo - cal Leica TCS NT microscope . For flow cytometry and cell sorting , cultured cells were trypsinized , washed twice in PBS , 2 % FCS , and sorted on a FACStar Plus ® ( Becton Dickinson ) by their level of GFP expression .
