Yet , adherence to AET remains challenging due to side effects . This study delves into the lived experience of breast cancer survivors concerning AET - induced side effects and examines differences in symptom profiles between Tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors ( AIs ) . Methods We interviewed 35 breast cancer survivors on AET , conducting qualitative iterative analysis using grounded theory . A codebook was developed to aid data coding and interpretation . NVIVO software facilitated comprehensive transcript analysis . Results Survivors reported a spectrum of side effects like hot flashes , sexual issues , joint pain , stiffness , mood swings , and fertility concerns . Symptom profiles differed based on AET type . Tamoxifen users experienced more frequent sexual side effects and mood swings , while AIs were linked to joint pain , stiffness , and bone health worries . Those on AET for over 6 months expressed heightened concerns about side effects . Conclusion Tailored patient education , aligned with AET type , empowers survivors to manage side effects using self - regula - tory strategies . Acknowledging distinct symptom profiles enables informed decisions , improving adherence and quality of life . Implications This study underscores tailored survivorship support , equipping patients with tools to manage side effects , enhancing adherence , and long - term outcomes . The findings inform the integration of comprehensive survivorship programs , emphasizing individualized strategies for managing side effects and promoting better adherence and improved quality of life . Keywords Adjuvant endocrine therapy · Quality of life · Medication adherence · Side effect management Introduction Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women , surpassing even lung cancer [ 1 ] . Globally , approx - imately 2 , 261 , 419 new cases were diagnosed among women in 2020 alone [ 2 ] . In 2022 , an estimated 339 , 250 women in the USA will receive a breast cancer diagno - sis [ 2 ] . Hormone receptor ( HR ) positive breast cancers account for 70 to 80 % of all diagnoses , making them a sig - nificant subset [ 3 ] . Adjuvant endocrine therapy ( AET ) is a cornerstone of treatment for women with ER - positive or PR - positive invasive breast cancer , recommended regard - less of age or lymph node status [ 4 ] . Clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of AET in reducing recurrence rates and improving survival , underscoring its impor - tance during the survivorship period [ 5 , 6 ] . Tamoxifen , prescribed for both premenopausal and postmenopausal patients , reduces the risk of recurrence by 46 % and breast cancer mortality by 26 % over a 5 - year course [ 7 ] . Aro - matase inhibitors ( AIs ) , mainly used in postmenopausal women , can be prescribed as primary adjuvant treatment * Kuang - Yi Wen Kuang - Yi .

However , despite AET ' s clinical effectiveness , a systematic review of 29 studies revealed suboptimal adherence rates in clinical practice , with over two thirds of breast cancer patients failing to complete the recommended 5 years of treatment [ 9 ] . Nota - bly , discontinuation rates during the first year of treatment range from 31 to 73 % , highlighting the need for strategies to promote compliance from treatment initiation [ 9 – 11 ] . Both qualitative and quantitative studies have identified severe adverse events and side effects as major barriers to AET adherence across racial and ethnic groups [ 12 – 19 ] . Qualitative data show that patients often lack knowledge about AET ' s clinical evidence and side - effect management [ 20 , 21 ] . Emotional distress and concerns about long - term AET use have also been associated with nonadherence [ 12 , 13 , 22 , 23 ] . Yet , qualitative data collection during the critical first year of AET initiation has been limited . Recent research has even demonstrated a link between nonadherence during this period and disease progression , underscoring the need to address early barriers to adher - ence [ 24 ] . With extended treatment durations now recom - mended , a deeper understanding of patients ' experiences is essential for the development of interventions that support both initiation and maintenance of treatment . This study employs grounded theory to explore the experiences of breast cancer patients during the first year of AET use . By examining barriers and facilitators to adherence , particularly in relation to side effects , this research seeks to inform the development of tailored inter - ventions aimed at improving AET adherence . The study aims to educate and support patients in managing side effects and enhancing adherence during the critical transi - tion from active treatment to survivorship . Methods Sample Participants were recruited from the Sidney Kimmel Can - cer Center ( SKCC ) at Thomas Jefferson University and Fox Chase Cancer Center ( FCCC ) at Temple Health in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , USA . Eligible participants were women aged 18 or older , English - speaking , diag - nosed with primary breast cancer ( stage I - III ) , ER - positive or PR - positive , and within their first year of AET initia - tion . The study intentionally included patients on either AIs or Tamoxifen to account for potential differences in adherence and symptom experience [ 25 ] . The decision to focus on the first year of treatment initiation was influ - enced by evidence showing its predictive value for long - term discontinuation [ 26 ] . Interview procedures The study received IRB approval from Thomas Jefferson University , and participants provided informed consent . An interview guide , adapted from a previous study , was used to explore participants’ understanding , expectations , experi - ences , and coping strategies related to AET [ 21 ] . Interviews were conducted between December 2019 and December 2020 , either in person or via remote platforms due to the COVID - 19 pandemic . Analysis To capture the nuanced experiences of patients , a grounded theory approach was employed . This method was chosen for its ability to delve into complex symptom phenomena and their underlying dynamics [ 27 ] . Transcripts were analyzed iteratively , with themes emerging from the data and question probes refined as needed . A codebook was developed , and interpretive codes were added throughout the analysis . The NVIVO qualitative data analysis software facilitated cod - ing and collaboration among team members . Kappa values reflected strong agreement among coders . Results We endeavored to establish contact with 94 breast cancer patients undergoing AET through referrals from medical oncologists , facilitated by the clinical research coordina - tors involved in the study . Out of these efforts , a total of 40 subjects were successfully recruited for the interviews , ultimately culminating in 35 completed and analyzed inter - views . Among those who declined participation , several rea - sons were identified : 1 ) being emotionally overwhelmed by their cancer experience , 2 ) lacking interest in participating , 3 ) having a history of multiple cancers , or 4 ) encountering scheduling conflicts . Table 1 provides an overview of the demographic and medical characteristics of the study participants ( N = 35 ) . The average age of the participants was 52 . 5 years ( with a standard deviation of 11 . 7 ) . The majority of participants held college degrees ( 74 . 2 % ) , identified as White ( 68 . 5 % ) , and were married ( 57 . 1 % ) . In terms of cancer staging , 24 participants ( 68 . 5 % ) were diagnosed with stage I breast can - cer , 6 with stage II ( 17 . 14 % ) , and 3 with stage III ( 8 . 5 % ) . The distribution of participants between aromatase inhibitors ( 65 . 5 % ) and tamoxifen ( 34 . 2 % ) favored the former . At the time of enrollment , 3 women ( 8 . 7 % ) had been on their medi - cation for less than 3 months , 13 ( 37 . 1 % ) for 3 – 6 months , and 19 ( 54 . 2 % ) for 6 – 12 months . This heterogeneity in Supportive Care in Cancer ( 2023 ) 31 : 719 1 3 Page 3 of 8 719 medication duration underscores the inclusion of partici - pants at different stages of the first year of AET initiation , providing a comprehensive insight into the early survivor - ship experience . Side effects of medication and mitigation strategies Table 2 presents a quantified breakdown of patients experi - encing notable side effects , categorized by the type of medi - cation they were on . Overall , it was observed that as the treatment duration increased , patients tended to experience a higher number of side effects . However , Tamoxifen exhib - ited a greater prevalence of sexual side effects , hot flashes , and mood changes . Conversely , women on aromatase inhibi - tors reported a higher occurrence of joint pain , stiffness , and expressed concerns regarding bone mass loss and fertility . The coping strategies employed by participants have exhibited diversity , as expounded upon in the results sec - tion and succinctly summarized in Table 3 . Notably , patients predominantly referenced coping strategies for managing joint pain , signifying its prominence . Hot flashes were the second most common concern for which coping strategies were utilized , reinforcing their prevalence among breast cancer patients . In contrast , strategies for addressing sexual health concerns were mentioned with less frequency , while strategies for mood and cognitive issues emerged as the least mentioned in the dataset . This distribution underscores the distinctive emphasis placed on different side effects and the corresponding strategies developed by participants in their journey of navigating AET . Joint pain and stiffness Experiencing persistent pain , patients shared their daily struggles and likened it to post - exercise soreness : “It’s just , everything hurts all the time . I feel like I just exercised yesterday , but it ' s every day that I am exercising , so we don ' t even have the benefit of it . ” ( Tamoxifen ) Some faced uncertainty whether to attribute the pain to medication or comorbidities : “…the joint pain is really my only problem . I have arthritis anyway . …” ( Letrozole ) “…So how do I know that it was the result of the medi - cation I was on , that ' s one of the reasons why I had to stop taking Letrozole , so we could narrow down the actual cause of my joint pain and the muscle pain…… “ ( Letrozole ) In some cases , the severity of pain led patients to pause medication based on their care team’s recommendation : Table 1 Demographic data Variable N = 35 Percentage Age , years : M ( SD ) 52 . 5 ( 11 . 73 ) Race White 24 68 . 5 % Black or African American 10 28 . 5 % Asian 1 2 . 8 % Ethnicity Non - Hispanic 34 97 . 1 % Hispanic 0 0 % Unknown 1 2 . 9 % Marital status Married 20 57 . 1 % Single / Divorced 15 42 . 9 % Education level High School 9 25 . 7 % College Graduate 24 74 . 2 % Post Graduate 2 5 . 7 % Breast cancer stage I 21 68 . 5 % II 6 17 . 14 % III 4 8 . 5 % Medication AI : Letrozole 5 14 . 2 % AI : Anastrozole 15 42 . 8 % AI : Exemestane 3 8 . 5 % Tamoxifen 12 34 . 2 % AI medication duration : Less than 3 months 3 8 . 7 % 3 – 6 months 13 37 . 1 % 6 – 12 months 19 54 . 2 % Supportive Care in Cancer ( 2023 ) 31 : 719 1 3 719 Page 4 of 8 “… my side effects of joint pains are really severe . So , they asked me to stop the medication for about three weeks . ” ( Letrozole ) Stiffness posed a nuanced challenge , often likened to premature aging : “…I think the stiffness I get , I feel very tight . My body . So when I go to get up after sitting for a little while , I feel like an old lady… . ” ( Anastrozole ) The progression of stiffness throughout the day , resem - bling arthritic pain , was described : “… . it ' s like arthritis , as I ' m starting my day , it goes away , I feel like I have arthritis when I wake up in the morning and then my fingers they ' re cramping and achy , and sometimes I drop things that I don ' t normally drop . …” ( Anastrozole ) Coping strategies for pain and stiffness Patients employed various strategies , starting with anal - gesics and non - steroidal anti - inflammatory medications : “… I would take Tylenol and that seemed to work… . ” ( Letrozole ) “… . As far as the joint pain goes , I do take Advil or Naproxen . I take three a day… . ” ( Anastrozole ) Table 2 Side effects ( SE ) and the number of patients experiencing the side effects in the transcripts Participants on Tamoxifen ( 11 ) Participants on AI ( 20 ) Total ( 31 ) SE concerns related to medication adherence 9 ( 81 . 9 % ) 15 ( 75 . 0 % ) 24 ( 77 . 4 % ) Sexual health 5 ( 45 . 5 % ) 4 ( 20 . 0 % ) 9 ( 29 . 0 % ) Hot flashes 5 ( 45 . 5 % ) 11 ( 55 . 0 % ) 16 ( 51 . 6 % ) Joint pain - Stiffness - Aches 5 ( 45 . 5 % ) 15 ( 75 . 0 % ) 20 ( 64 . 5 % ) Mood changes 3 ( 27 . 3 % ) 4 ( 20 . 0 % ) 7 ( 22 . 6 % ) Fertility 1 ( 9 . 1 % ) 2 ( 10 . 0 % ) 3 ( 9 . 6 % ) Bone mass decrease concerns 0 ( 0 . 0 % ) 2 ( 10 . 0 % ) 2 ( 6 . 5 % ) Reported SE management strategies 5 ( 45 . 5 % ) 13 ( 65 . 0 % ) 18 ( 58 . 1 % ) Sexual health • Vaginal Suppositories , Personal lubricant 3 ( 27 . 3 % ) 2 ( 10 . 0 % ) 5 ( 16 . 1 % ) Hot flashes • SSRI • Varying the time of medication 6 ( 54 . 6 % ) 7 ( 35 . 0 % ) 13 ( 41 . 9 % ) • Acupuncture Joint pain / stiffness - aches • Analgesics 3 ( 27 . 3 % ) 11 ( 55 . 0 % ) 14 ( 45 . 2 % ) • Varying the time of medication • Exercise • Massage • Physical Therapy Mood changes • Exercise • Deep breathing exercises 2 ( 18 . 2 % ) 1 ( 5 . 0 % ) 3 ( 9 . 6 % ) Table 3 Summary of mitigation strategies by problem type AET - related concern Mitigation strategy Joint pain and stiffness OTC pain medications Massages with different topical creams Exercise , stretching , yoga , bike riding , and walks Physical therapy Medication pause or time variation Hot flashes Medication pause or time variation SSRI Acupuncture Vaginal Dryness Personal lubricants and suppositories Mood Changes Breathing exercises Charity and community involvement Supportive Care in Cancer ( 2023 ) 31 : 719 1 3 Page 5 of 8 719 Timing adjustments were noted , with taking medication at night to minimize daytime pain : “… . so I take it at night , so it occurs during the night , and I don ' t have it so much during the day . …” ( Letro - zole ) Massage , stretching , and physical activities emerged as effective solutions : “… . . I was like , wow , I just get like a massage . I ' ll just massage myself and um , drink plenty of water… . ” ( Exemestane ) “… . . Yes . I try to do yoga . Oh , um and workout… Walk - ing helps tremendously . Yeah . I try to walk my dogs twice a day… . ” ( Anastrozole ) Engaging with non - physician health professionals , like physical therapy , was also beneficial : “…I ' m not managing them very well . The pain I ' m man - aging by seeing physical therapy . … . ” ( Anastrozole ) Hot flashes Patients detailed the impact of hot flashes on sleep and daily life : “… . I just get overheated , like really fast . I ' ll just start sweating and it ' s bad at nighttime… . ” ( Anastrozole ) “… . Almost everything that I do , it doesn ' t seem like I have the tolerance to actually do it more than 15 min because these hot flashes are coming every 10 , 15 min… . ” ( Tamoxifen ) Coping strategies for hot flashes Adjusting AET timing was a common technique to reduce night sweats : “Taking it in the morning , I felt like , and even if I take it too early in the night , if I take it dinnertime , I feel like I get night sweats really bad” ( Anastrozole ) . Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) and acu - puncture were effective interventions : “… . They did give me Lexapro… acupuncture . I do acupuncture regularly………” ( Letrozole ) Sexual health as an undiscussed symptom Patients emphasized the private nature of sexual health and lack of discussions with healthcare providers : “…Yeah . Because I think that ' s probably a big con - cern… I don ' t know if this is really addressed the way it should be . ” ( Anastrozole ) . “… . . I have , a lot of dryness… diagnosed with atrophic vaginitis… . . ” ( Anastrozole ) Coping strategies for sexual health issues Suppositories and lubricants were found effective : " … . I use K - Y jelly , for sexual intercourse… that works fine for me . … " ( Anastrozole ) . Mood changes Patients shared mood swings and emotional shifts while on AET medications : “… . My husband was asking questions too whether was due to the medication… mood swings… . ” ( Anastro - zole ) “……Sometimes I can feel myself getting agitated… not sure it is from the pill . ” ( Anastrozole ) “ …And then I started getting the anger . And then I felt like I could not relax . I could not concentrate…I wonder how this med affected me emotionally . ” ( Anas - trozole ) Coping strategies for mood changes Some patients were prescribed SSRIs : “… . you need to sit down with yourself and take a break , the doctor finally put me on some Prozac… . ” ( Anastrozole ) Deep breathing , relaxation exercises , exercise , and com - munity support were highlighted : “…deep breathing , just nice deep breath to slow my breathing and just center myself… . ” ( Tamoxifen ) “I also exercise a lot… That helped me tremendously . ” ( Tamoxifen ) “…… . I indulged in that I become a support system to other people… really get me off my feet…” ( Anas - trozole ) Supportive Care in Cancer ( 2023 ) 31 : 719 1 3 719 Page 6 of 8 Discussion This study provides valuable insights into the lived experi - ences of breast cancer patients undergoing AET during the early survivorship period . While not designed for direct statistical comparison between subgroups ( Tamoxifen vs . AI ) , our observations across these subgroups offer novel perspectives on the challenges and coping strategies asso - ciated with different AET medications . Notably , side effects exhibited variations based on the type and dura - tion of the medication . By intentionally focusing on patients within their first year of AET initiation , our study diverges from those that sample beyond this initial period . Sood et al . demonstrated that inconsistent adherence during the first year predicts long - term discontinuation [ 26 ] . In seeking a more intimate understanding through one - on - one interviews , we aimed to unravel the factors motivating patients to adhere to treat - ment and the obstacles they face , particularly regarding medication - related side effects—an often - cited reason for non - adherence [ 12 – 19 ] . Amidst shared concerns and cop - ing strategies , a common theme emerged : patients persist in their adherence due to the outweighing benefits of survival and recurrence prevention , despite enduring side effects . Coping mechanisms spanned personalized strategies , both involving support from the care team and lifestyle adjust - ments tailored to individual circumstances . Foremost among the reported side effects was joint pain , consistent with a review study indicating prevalence rates ranging from 20 to 74 % in AI - treated patients [ 28 ] . Participants described joint pain and stiffness of varying intensities , some endur - ing severe discomfort impeding daily activities . Such find - ings align with the literature , which suggests that AET can exacerbate existing joint pain or arthritis [ 29 ] . Similarly , hot flashes , affecting up to 70 % of AET patients , disrupted sleep through excessive sweating or overheating [ 30 ] . Addressing sexual health , the study revealed how AET - induced vaginal dryness and reduced desire mirrored existing literature [ 31 ] , with vaginal dryness linked to higher tamoxifen levels [ 32 ] . Importantly , patients expressed reluctance to discuss these intimate matters with spouses or healthcare providers , high - lighting the need for improved support . Mood swings , anxiety , and feelings of isolation were prevalent among patients , reflecting the emotional toll of AET . Coping strategies encompassed various approaches , including over - the - counter pain medications like NSAIDs and paracetamol . However , literature highlights the limited efficacy of these agents compared to serotonin and norepi - nephrine reuptake inhibitors [ 33 ] . Massage , coupled with topical creams , emerged as a strategy to alleviate pain and stiffness , although limited empirical evidence supports its effectiveness [ 34 ] . Physical activities such as exercise , yoga , stretching , and bike riding resonated as effective means to mitigate multiple side effects , corroborating existing litera - ture [ 35 – 37 ] . Notably , physical therapy garnered attention for its positive impact on joint pain and stiffness , though guidelines suggest incorporating such therapy before treat - ment initiation [ 38 ] . Supplementary approaches , such as acupuncture for managing hot flashes and relaxation tech - niques for mood swings , were noted by patients . Context - specific strategies included changing attire in layers dur - ing the day to counter hot flashes and tailoring medication timing to minimize discomfort . Encouragingly , patients engaged in charity and community involvement , citing these activities as means to manage mood changes and enhance overall well - being . Interestingly , as the first year of AET progressed , partici - pants reported a broader spectrum of side effects that emerged or intensified . While joint pain and hot flashes were consist - ently mentioned , some symptoms appeared later in the first year of treatment . Notably , women on tamoxifen frequently discussed sexual health issues , including vaginal dryness and decreased libido , as dominant concerns during the later stages of the first year . This contrasts with women on AIs , who primarily struggled with joint pain , stiffness , and mood changes throughout the entire year . The distinct symptom pat - terns between tamoxifen and AIs suggest that the medication’s mechanisms of action might influence the onset and promi - nence of side effects . Further , participants who had been on AET for six to 12 months reported experiencing more severe side effects compared to those on medication for shorter dura - tions . This temporal progression of side effects emphasizes the importance of supporting patients through the early stages of treatment , when side effects might intensify . Moreover , the experiences of these patients underscore the need for tailored interventions as patients transition from initial therapy to long - term management . Furthermore , the findings unveil the importance of acknowl - edging and addressing the diversity within the patient population . For instance , women with preexisting joint pain or arthritis faced compounded challenges , particularly if they were prescribed AIs . This subgroup reported a higher degree of interference with daily activities due to intensified pain and stiffness , reinforcing the need for personalized treatment approaches that account for individual health histories . Additionally , while mood changes were a common concern , patients described varying emotional responses , ranging from mild mood swings to more profound anxiety and emotional distress . Such variability highlights the need for a nuanced under - standing of patients ' emotional states to provide tailored psycho - social support . In light of these findings , enhancing adherence to AET during the crucial first year takes on paramount significance . The distinct symptom patterns observed between tamoxifen and AIs , along with the progression of side effects over time , Supportive Care in Cancer ( 2023 ) 31 : 719 1 3 Page 7 of 8 719 present a unique window of opportunity . By providing tar - geted interventions and support during this early phase , we could potentially alleviate the impact of side effects , reduce discomfort , and improve patients’ overall treatment experience . Furthermore , addressing side effects comprehensively during the first year could have a far - reaching impact on long - term compliance . Research by Sood et al . has shown that inconsist - ent adherence during the first year of AET initiation predicts long - term permanent discontinuation , which in turn affects survival rates [ 26 ] . Thus , the interventions we devise and implement to improve first - year adherence have the potential to foster long - term compliance , subsequently translating into improved survival outcomes and reduced recurrence risk . By integrating these insights into survivorship care strategies , healthcare providers can create a patient - centered approach that not only mitigates immediate challenges but also strength - ens the foundation for continued treatment success throughout the breast cancer survivor’s journey . Study strengths and limitations The present study contributes to the limited body of quali - tative research focusing on breast cancer patients undergo - ing AET within the initial year of survivorship . Given the established link between early adherence to AET and long - term compliance , comprehending the factors influencing patient adherence and barriers during this crucial phase is paramount . Employing qualitative methods allowed for an in - depth exploration of patients’ experiences , particularly concerning side effects and their management . Notably , our diverse sample encompassed individuals on both AI and Tamoxifen across varying timelines in the first year , enhancing the robustness of our findings . Nonetheless , it ' s important to acknowledge the study ' s limitations , such as the small purposive sample size , which may constrain the generalizability of the results to a broader population . Conclusion In conclusion , this qualitative study offers valuable insights into the experiences of breast cancer survivors undergoing AET and their coping strategies . The diverse challenges faced , from joint pain to mood changes , underscore the need for personalized support . The significance of the first year of AET in shaping long - term adherence highlights the potential to improve overall compliance and treatment out - comes . Healthcare providers can leverage these findings to engage in more informed and collaborative discussions with patients , enhancing survivorship care . By integrating survi - vor perspectives , we can foster a patient - centric approach that promotes adherence , quality of life , and ultimately , bet - ter long - term outcomes .
