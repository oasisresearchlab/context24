However , numerous studies have demonstrated that ARPE19 38 undergo morphologic , transcriptomic and genomic alterations over time and with increasing 39 passage number . Herein , we explore the mechanisms underlying increased resistance to the 40 delivery of exogenous genetic material via transfection in ARPE19 cells using mass 41 spectrometry . 42 43 METHODS 44 ARPE19 cells ( N = 5 wells / reagent ) were seeded in 6 - well plates at passages 24 through 30 . At 45 70 % confluency an mCherry reporter construct was delivered via transfection using 46 Lipofectamine 3000 , Lipofectamine LTX , Lipofectamine Stem , or PEI ( polyethylenimine ) 47 reagents . After 72 hours , transfection efficiency was quantified by fluorescence microscopy and 48 flow cytometry . Mass spectrometry and immunofluorescence of ARPE19 cells were performed 49 at passages 24 and 30 to evaluate altered protein synthesis and localization between passage 50 numbers . 51 52 RESULTS 53 ARPE19 transfection showed a maximum transfection efficiency of 32 . 4 % at P26 using 54 Lipofectamine 3000 reagent . All lipofectamine based reagents demonstrated statistically 55 significant decreases in transfection efficiency between passages 24 and 30 . Mass 56 spectrometry analysis revealed 18 differentially expressed proteins , including down - regulation of 57 clathrin light chain B ( CLTB ) and legumain ( LGMN ) that was confirmed via immunofluorescence 58 imaging , which indicated altered intracellular localization . 59 60 CONCLUSIONS 61 ARPE19 cells demonstrate passage number dependent changes in lipofectamine - based 62 transfection efficiency . Mass spectrometry and immunofluorescence indicates the observed 63 decrease in transfection efficiency involves the dysregulation of endocytosis and intracellular 64 endolysosomal trafficking at later passages . 65 66 TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE 67 This study contributes to mounting evidence for changes in ARPE19 cell physiology with 68 increasing passage number . This information is of value for the continued use of ARPE19 cells 69 as a model system for RPE biology and the development of therapeutics . 70 71 INTRODUCTION 72 Age related macular degeneration ( AMD ) is a leading cause of blindness in the elderly 73 and affects an estimated 8 . 7 % of all individuals between the ages of 45 and 85 . 1 In the earliest 74 “dry” form of this disease , abnormal accumulations of various lipids and proteins , termed 75 drusen , develop within Bruch’s membrane in the macula . These deposits interfere with the 76 exchange of nutrients , waste and oxygen across Bruch’s membrane and between the retinal 77 pigment epithelium ( RPE ) and the underlying choriocapillaris , ultimately leading to dysfunction 78 and loss of RPE and photoreceptor cells associated with progressive loss of central vision . In 79 approximately 10 - 15 % of cases , disruption of nutrient and oxygen exchange following extensive 80 drusen accumulation triggers a transition from a “dry” to neovascular or “wet” AMD , where blood 81 vessels grow from the choroid into the retinal layers of the macula , leading to rapid vision loss 82 due to edema and inflammation . 2 – 5 83 ARPE19 cells are a spontaneously immortalized human RPE cell line , originally derived 84 and characterized in 1996 and have been found to express numerous RPE cell markers such as 85 RPE65 and CRALBP . 6 Since then , these cells have been used to study numerous RPE cell 86 processes , including outer segment phagocytosis , differentiation , and the effects of oxidative 87 stress . 7 – 11 ARPE19 cells have also been utilized as a cell culture model to study numerous 88 diseases characterized by pathologies affecting RPE cells including AMD , retinitis pigmentosa , 89 and Stargardt’s disease . 12 – 21 Unfortunately , there is growing evidence to support the hypothesis 90 that ARPE19 cells are not truly immortalized , as they demonstrate changes in morphology , 91 abnormal karyotype , decreased viability , and signs of senescence with increasing passage 92 number . 22 – 25 This represents a major potential future problem , wherein as ARPE19 cells 93 continue to be used , the passage number at which cells are available will inexorably increase 94 towards the point where the cell line no longer truly recapitulates RPE cell physiology or 95 function . 96 While ARPE19 cell lines have been historically useful for the study of RPE cell 97 processes and pathologies , generally low transfection and transduction efficiencies have been a 98 significant barrier for the use , and as such , elucidating the optimal transfection reagent for 99 transgene delivery is an important consideration . 26 , 27 In the process of comparing four 100 commonly utilized transfection reagents over multiple passages , we identified a highly 101 significant decrease in efficiency and explored , using a combination of immunohistochemistry 102 and protein mass spectrometry , the mechanism underlying decreasing transfection efficiency 103 with advancing passage number . 104 105 MATERIALS AND METHODS 106 ARPE19 cell culture 107 ARPE19 cells ( American Type Culture Collection , Manassas , VA ) were thawed at P23 from - 80 108  C and were initially grown in a T25cm 2 flask in DMEM / F12 + GlutaMAX media ( Gibco Life 109 Technologies , Carlsbad , CA ) containing 10 % Fetal bovine serum ( FBS ; Gibco Life 110 Technologies , Carlsbad , CA ) and 1 % Antibiotic - Antimycotic ( Gibco Life Technologies , Carlsbad , 111 CA ) . Upon reaching approximately 90 % confluency , ARPE19 cells were passaged using TrypLE 112 ( Gibco Life Technologies , Carlsbad , CA ) and seeded at a 1 : 5 ratio . After the initial passage , 113 ARPE19 cells ( P24 - P30 ) were cultured in T75cm 2 flasks with DMEM / F12 + GlutaMAX media 114 containing 10 % FBS and 1 % Anti - Anti and were passaged at 95 % confluency . 115 116 Transfection 117 Transfection at P24 - P30 was carried out in DMEM / F12 + GlutaMAX media containing 2 % FBS 118 and 1 % Antibiotic - Antimycotic using Lipofectamine Stem ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , 119 MA ) , Lipofectamine LTX with Plus Reagent ( termed herein , Lipofectamine LTX ; Thermo Fisher 120 Scientific , Waltham , MA ) , Lipofectamine 3000 ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA ) or 121 polyethylenimine ( PEI ; Polysciences , PA , USA ) reagents on ARPE19 cells seeded in 6 - well 122 plates at 70 % confluency using 1 μg pCBA - mCherry per well and following the respective 123 manufacturers’ protocols . Briefly , lipofectamine transfections were carried out by combining 124 transfection reagent and DNA plasmid in OptiMEM media ( Gibco Life Technologies , Carlsbad , 125 CA ) , followed by an incubation period dictated by manufacturer protocols . The transfection 126 solution is then added directly into transfection media and applied to cells . PEI transfection was 127 carried out by combining PEI and DNA at a 2 : 1 ratio in transfection media , followed by a 20 - 128 minute incubation period . The PEI - DNA complex is then applied directly onto cells . Gene 129 delivery efficiencies were quantified at 72 hours post transfection via fluorescence microscopy 130 and flow cytometry . 131 132 Flow Cytometry 133 After imaging with fluorescent microscopy , transfected and control ARPE19 cells were 134 dissociated from the well and into a single cell suspension with TrypLE . Cells were washed 135 once with PBS , fixed with 4 % PFA for 30 minutes , and washed twice more with PBS before 136 being resuspended in 500ul of PBS . Cell suspension was filtered with a 40um nylon mesh cell 137 strainer ( Fisher Scientific , Pittsburg , PA , ) immediately before analysis with a BD LSRII flow 138 cytometer ( BD Biosciences , Franklin Lakes , NJ ) . 30 , 000 events were recorded for each well 139 with untransfected ARPE19 cells as gating control ( Supplementary Figure 1 ) . BD FACSDiva 140 software ( BD Biosciences ) was used to determine transfection efficiency . 141 142 Histology 143 Untransfected control wells at passages 24 and 30 were fixed with 4 % PFA for 30 minutes , 144 permeabilized for 20 minutes with 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) washed 145 four times in 0 . 05 % Tween 20 ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) for 10 minutes before blocking in 146 0 . 05 % Tween with 10 % normal donkey serum ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) for one hour at 147 room temperature . Primary antibody was applied at an appropriate concentration ( Table 1 ) in 148 0 . 05 % Tween with 2 . 5 % normal donkey serum and incubated at 4  C overnight . Cells were 149 again washed four times in 0 . 05 % Tween for 10 minutes before secondary antibody ( Alexa 150 Fluor 488 , Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) was applied at 1 : 1000 dilution in 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 and 151 2 . 5 % normal donkey serum for 1 hour at room temperature . After secondary antibody removal , 152 cells were washed three times in 0 . 05 % Tween for 10 minutes , stained with Hoechst 33342 153 ( 1 : 1000 in PBS , LifeTechnologies , Eugene , OR ) and washed three times with PBS for 10 154 minutes before being mounted . Immunofluorescence ( IF ) staining was then visualized with 155 fluorescence confocal microscopy . 156 157 Table 1 .

Untransfected ARPE19 cells were collected via 161 trypsinization with TrypLE ( Gibco Life Technologies , Carlsbad , CA ) at passages 24 and 30 for 162 mass spectrometry ( MS ) . Cells were washed twice with PBS , pelleted via centrifugation at 163 16 , 100xg for 5 minutes , flash frozen , and stored at - 80 °C until ready for use . Cell pellets were 164 thawed on ice and then resuspended in 100 mM AmBic containing 20 % MeCN and 2x Invitrosol 165 ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA ) . Samples were lysed by sonication ( VialTweeter ; 166 Hielscher Ultrasonics , Teltow , Germany ) on ice for 25 cycles of 10 seconds on 30 seconds off . 167 Cysteines were reduced in 5mM TCEP for 30 min at 37°C and alkylated with 10 mM 168 iodoacetamide for 30 min at 37°C . Sequencing - grade porcine trypsin / Lys - C mix ( Promega , 169 Madison , WI ) was added , and the pH was adjusted to 8 . 5 with NaOH ( 2N ) . Digestion proceeded 170 for 18 h at 37 °C on a Thermomixer at 1200 rpm in the dark . Samples were acidified to below 171 pH 3 with 10 % TFA . Digested proteins were cleaned using a SolAμTM SPE plate ( Thermo 172 Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA ) on a vacuum manifold with a waste collection tray . Plate wells 173 used for peptide clean - up were washed sequentially with LC - MS grade MeCN ( 1 × 200 μL ) and 174 0 . 1 % TFA in LC - MS grade water ( 1 × 200 μL ) . Samples were added to the wells and washed 175 sequentially with 0 . 1 % TFA in water ( 1 × 200 μL ) and 0 . 1 % FA in LC - MS grade water ( 1 × 100 176 μL ) . The waste collection tray was removed from the vacuum manifold and replaced with a 96 - 177 well polypropylene collection plate . Samples were eluted into the collection plate with 70 % 178 MeCN ( 2 × 100 μL ) and the eluates were transferred to 1 . 5 mL microcentrifuge tubes for drying 179 under vacuum at room temperature . Samples were resuspended by vortexing in 50 μL of LC - 180 MS grade 2 % MeCN in water . The Pierce Quantitative Fluorescent Peptide Assay ( Thermo 181 Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA ) was used to determine sample concentrations to normalize to 182 500 ng for each 20 µL LC - MS injection , with Thermo Scientific Pierce Peptide Retention Time 183 Calibration Mixture added at 4 nM concentration . Equal amounts of each were combined to form 184 a pooled QC sample . 185 186 Mass spectrometry data analysis 187 Each sample was analyzed on a Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Fusion Lumos MS via 3 technical 188 replicate injections using data - dependent acquisition ( DDA ) HCD MS2 instrument method 189 outlined in Table S1 . The technical replicates were blocked , and each block was randomized . 190 Pooled QCs , which are a mixture of all the samples being analyzed , were analyzed at the start , 191 end , and in between each sample block . MS data were analyzed using Proteome Discoverer 192 2 . 4 ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA ) platform , as outlined in Table S2 . Protein 193 identifications were filtered to include only those proteins identified by two or more unique 194 peptides identified . 195 196 Differential expression calling was performed on normalized read count data generated by 197 Proteome Discoverer 2 . 4 ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA ) using integrated Differential 198 Expression and Pathway ( iDEP ) analysis ( http : / / bioinformatics . sdstate . edu / idep / ) tool . 28 Box 199 plots for data normalization and sample variance were assessed as part of quality control 200 ( Supplementary Figure 2 ) . Gene enrichment analysis was subsequently performed on 201 differentially expressed gene lists using ShinyGO 0 . 76 ( http : / / bioinformatics . sdstate . edu / go / ) to 202 identify altered biological pathways between groups . 203 204 Statistical analysis 205 Transfection efficiency was analyzed using one - way ANOVA with Tukey multiple comparisons 206 test to compare transfection efficiencies between passage numbers within reagents . This was 207 conducted with a confidence level of 95 % ( α = 0 . 05 ) . Analysis and graphs were created using 208 GraphPad Prism 9 . 209 210 211 RESULTS 212 Transfection efficiency decreases with increasing passage number . 213 To determine the relationship between increasing passage number and transfection efficiency in 214 the ARPE19 cell line , 10 , 0000 cells were plated per 6 - well ( n = 5 wells / reagent / passage ) and 215 allowed to grow to 70 % confluency prior to being transfected using either Lipofectamine Stem , 216 Lipofectamine LTX , Lipofectamine 3000 , or PEI complexed with 1  g plasmid DNA expressing a 217 red fluorescent reporter ( mCherry ) transgene under the control of a ubiquitous chicken beta 218 actin ( CBA ) promoter . 72 hours post - transfection cells were harvested and the transfection 219 efficiency quantified using flow cytometry relative to untransfected controls ( Supplementary 220 Figure 1 , Supplementary Figure 3 ) . 221 ARPE19 transfection efficiency decreased dramatically for all transfection reagents 222 evaluated as a function of increasing passage number , reaching statistical significance when 223 comparing later passages ( e . g . P29 or P30 ) to the transfection efficiency at P24 for all four 224 reagents ( Figure 1 ) . The most effective reagent for transfecting ARPE19 cells was determined 225 to be Lipofectamine 3000 ( Figure 1A - B ) , with a mean transfection efficiency at P24 of 16 . 2 % 226 and maximum mean transfection efficiency of 32 . 4 % occurring at P26 . Transduction efficiency 227 of ARPE19 cells with the Lipofectamine 3000 reagent decreased by P30 to 5 . 62 % , representing 228 a - 2 . 88 - and - 5 . 76 - fold decrease compared to P24 ( p < 0 . 0001 ) and P30 ( p < 0 . 0001 ) , 229 respectively . 230 Lipofectamine LTX reagent was the second most effective transfection reagent 231 evaluated ( Figure 1C - D ) , resulting in a maximum mean transfection efficiency of 20 . 04 % at P24 . 232 Similarly , transfection efficiencies were significantly ( p < 0 . 0001 ) decreased by P30 ( 5 . 06 % ) , 233 representing a 3 . 96 - fold reduction in mCherry expression observed between P24 and P30 . 234 Transfection of ARPE19 cells with the Lipofectamine Stem reagent was only third most 235 efficient ( Figure 1E - F ) , reaching a mean efficiency of 6 . 5 % at P24 and a maximum mean 236 efficiency of 11 . 04 % at P28 , and yet demonstrated the greatest fold - change ( - 17 . 18 ) decrease 237 observed between early ( P24 ) and late - stage ( P30 ) passages ( p < 0 . 0001 ) . 238 Although transfection was observed to be least efficient with the PEI reagent ( Figure 1G - 239 H ) , with a maximum mean transfection efficiency of just 0 . 54 % observed at passage 28 , a 240 statistically significant ( p < 0 . 0001 ; one - way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons ) - 0 . 79 - 241 fold reduction in transfection efficiency was nevertheless observed between P24 and P29 . 242 Together , this data indicates a passage - dependent difference in transfection efficiencies , 243 especially amongst all tested lipofectamine - based reagents . 244 245 Mass Spectrometry of P24 versus P30 ARPE19 cells indicates down - regulation of genes 246 involved in clathrin - mediated lysosomal transport . 247 In order to explore the mechanistic alterations underlying the observed reduction in transfection 248 efficiency as a result of increasing passage number , we performed MS on whole ARPE19 cell 249 lysate harvested at P24 and P30 ( N = 3 biological replicates , N = 9 technical replicates per time 250 point ) . Quality control metrics indicated a low degree of variance between biological and 251 technical replicates at both P24 ( R 2 = 0 . 956 – 0 . 981 ) and P30 ( R 2 = 0 . 974 – 0 . 979 ) and that 252 transformed data was normally distributed across all samples ( Supplementary Figure 2 ) . 18 253 differentially expressed genes were identified as being either up - regulated ( 10 genes : BCAM , 254 GNR , HEBP2 , LXN , MELTF , MET , NNMT , PODXL , PRPF32A and PTGIS ) or down - regulated ( 8 255 genes : ALDH16A1 , CTLB , LGMN , LMCD1 , MFN2 , NOSTRIN , RBP1 , TGM2 ) in P30 versus P24 256 ARPE19 cells ( Figure 2A ) . Pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes revealed the 257 upregulation of several genes involved in the positive regulation of cell - cell adhesion , epithelial 258 cell migration and morphogenesis , and positive regulation of cell death and apoptosis , indicating 259 that APRE19 cells tend towards greater adhesion , cell division / migration and resistance to 260 programmed cell death with age ( Figure 2B ) . Most interestingly , in the context of the reduced 261 transfection efficiency observed using cationic - lipid transfection reagents ( e . g . Lipofectamine 262 stem , LTX and 3000 ) – which are dependent upon clathrin - mediated internalization of DNA - 263 containing liposomes for successful transfection – was the significant ( P = 0 . 0054 ; - log10 ( FDR ) = 264 1 . 11 ) down - regulation ( - 70 . 35 fold , P30 vs P24 ) of genes involved in clathrin - mediated 265 endocytosis ( e . g . clathrin light chain B ; CTLB ) and endo - lysosomal transport ( e . g . legumain ; 266 LGMN ) ( Figure 2B ) . 29 267 To determine whether changes in protein abundance observed by MS corresponded to 268 observable alterations in the presence or localization of differentially regulated proteins , we 269 performed IF staining of CLTB and LGMN in P24 and P30 ARPE19 cells and visualized the 270 staining pattern using confocal microscopy . CLTB IF staining showed subtle changes in CLTB 271 localization with cytoplasmic areas of lower intensity staining observable at P30 compared to 272 P24 across all APRE19 cultures examined ( Figure 3A - B , white lines ) . LGMN staining was 273 similarly disrupted with a clear shift from discrete peri - nuclear localization ( Figure 3C , white 274 arrows ) at P24 to a more disperse cytoplasmic staining pattern at P30 cells ( Figure 3D ) . When 275 combined with the previously described MS results , these data suggest dysfunction in 276 endocytosis and lysosomal transport in ARPE19 cells at higher passage numbers . As predicted 277 by the MS analysis , which showed no alterations in the expression levels of structural or tight 278 junction proteins , ARPE19 cells maintained tight junctions ZO - 1 at both P24 and P30 , indicating 279 decreased transfection efficiency was most likely not caused by dedifferentiation ( Figure 3E - F ) . 280 281 DISCUSSION 282 ARPE19 cells have been used extensively since their isolation in 1996 and serve as an important 283 model both for studying human RPE cell biology and the development of novel therapeutics for 284 diseases affecting the RPE and photoreceptors , such as Leber’s congenital amaurosis type 2 285 ( LCA2 ) . 6 Unlike RPE cells in vivo , which are highly amenable to the uptake of exogenous DNA 286 via both non - viral ( e . g . transfection ) and viral ( e . g . transduction ) approaches , immortalized 287 ARPE19 cells are relatively refractive to gene transfer , making them challenging to utilize . 26 , 27 In 288 this study , we set out to identify the optimal plasmid transfection reagent to efficiently delivery 289 plasmid DNA to ARPE19 cells by screening a variety of lipid and non - lipid based transfection 290 reagents , including polyethylenimine ( PEI ) , Lipofectamine 3000 , Lipofectamine Stem , and 291 Lipofectamine LTX with ‘Plus’ Reagents . 292 As one of the primary functions of RPE cells in their native environment is the phagocytosis 293 of shed outer segment disks , which are comprised of approximately 50 % lipid by weight , we 294 anticipated that lipofectamine - based transfection reagents that utilize lipid - DNA complexes to 295 transverse the cell membrane would be more efficient than transfection with PEI , which relies 296 upon endocytosis of cationic DNA - complexes across the anionic cell membrane . 30 , 31 While 297 lipofection - based transfection reagents were significantly more effective , with Lipofectamine 3000 298 reagent mediating maximum average transfection efficiency of 32 . 04  1 . 181 % versus 0 . 2  299 0 . 071 % than using PEI , the finding that transfection efficiency declines dramatically and 300 significantly between passages 24 and 30 was unexpected . PEI transfection also demonstrated 301 a decrease in transfection efficiency within this passage window ; however , while this data may be 302 statistically significant it is unlikely to be biologically relevant as transduction efficiencies were 303 consistently less than 1 % at all passages . 304 In order to explore the biological processes underlying the observed decline in transfection 305 efficiency across all reagents with increasing passage number , we performed MS to assess 306 relative changes in protein expression that may indicate differences in cellular physiology between 307 ARPE19 cells at passage 24 compared to passage 30 . In the context of decreased transfection 308 efficiency , specifically with liposomal - based reagents , the most relevant observed change was a 309 statistically significant ( P = 0 . 0054 ; - log10 ( FDR ) = 1 . 11 ) down - regulation ( - 70 . 35 fold ) of proteins 310 in the clathrin - mediated endocytosis pathway , including LGMN and CLTB , at P30 compared to 311 P24 . Clathrin light chains play a critical role in clathrin - mediated endocytosis , where they form 312 heterohexameric triskelion formations consisting of three light and three heavy clathrin chains . 313 These triskelion formations aggregate together to form a polyhedral lattice surrounding the 314 vesicle , and contributing towards assembly , stability and disassembly of the vesicle during uptake , 315 and so are integral to the clathrin - mediated endocytosis process . 32 – 38 As clathrin mediated - 316 endocytosis is known to be a primary route of liposome uptake , an overall decrease in cellular 317 levels of clathrin light chain B proteins may contribute directly to the decreased transfection 318 efficiency at later passages , where a reduced abundance of light chains leads to decreased 319 triskelion availability . 39 320 Similarly , legumain ( asparaginyl endopeptidase ) is a cysteine endopeptidase commonly 321 found within the endolysosomal pathway and is known to mediate degradation , activation , or 322 processing of numerous substrates , playing roles in immunity and cell signaling . 40 – 43 While 323 legumain is most commonly localized within lysosomes , legumain localization outside of the 324 endolysosomal pathway , such as in the nucleus and cytosol has been implicated in numerous 325 pathologies such as cancer and Alzheimer’s disease . 43 – 48 Additionally , legumain - deficient mice 326 display signs of lysosomal disease and hemophagocytic syndrome . 49 As such , unusual 327 localization of legumain within the cell structure may be a sign cellular dysfunction . 328 Confocal microscopy following IF staining of APRE19 cells for CTLB and LGMN supports 329 our MS observations , revealing areas of decreased protein expression and altered cellular 330 localization of CLTB and LGMN at P30 compared to P24 , respectively . While in this study we did 331 not explore the mechanism through which factors associated with lysosomal trafficking are being 332 down - regulated , that tight junction proteins such as ZO - 1 – a marker of endothelial cell maturation 333 – are not observed to be either down - regulated via MS or mis - localized on IF imaging , indicates 334 that the underlying process does not involve the de - differentiation of the APRE19 cells as a 335 function of increasing passage number . 336 In conclusion , ARPE19 cells are a commonly used model system for studying RPE biology 337 and the development of ocular pathologies ; however , their utility has come into question in recent 338 years wherein cells exhibit changes in both morphology and viability at high passage numbers . In 339 this study , we demonstrated that increasing passage number also affects transfection efficiency 340 is a process involving the dysregulation of endocytosis and intracellular endolysosomal trafficking . 341 342 343 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 344 The authors Michaela Pereckas and the Center for Biomedical Mass Spectrometry Research at 345 MCW for assistance with mass spectrometry . 346 347 348 FUNDING 349 Research reported in this publication was supported in part by the National Eye Institute under 350 award numbers R01EY027767 & T32EY014537 , the National Institute of General Medical 351 Sciences under award number T32GM080202 , and the Robert A .
