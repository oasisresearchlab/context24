Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering , Georgia Institute of Technology and Emory University , 313 Ferst Drive , Atlanta , GA 30332 , USA Received December 31 , 2006 ; Revised April 2 , 2007 ; Accepted April 3 , 2007 ABSTRACT The final step in the maturation of paramyxoviruses , orthomyxoviruses and viruses of several other families , entails the budding of the viral nucleo - capsid through the plasma membrane of the host cell . Many medically important viruses , such as influenza , parainfluenza , respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) and Ebola , can form filamentous particles when budding . Although filamentous virions have been previously studied , details of how viral filaments bud from the plasma membrane remain largely unknown . Using molecular beacon ( MB ) - fluorescent probes to image the viral genomic RNA ( vRNA ) of human RSV ( hRSV ) in live Vero cells , the dynamics of assembled viral filaments was observed to consist of three primary types of motion prior to egress from the plasma membrane : ( i ) filament projection and rotation , ( ii ) migration and ( iii ) non - directed motion . In addition , from information gained by imaging the 3D distribution of cellular vRNA , observing and characterizing vRNA dynamics , imaging vRNA / Myosin Va coloca - lization , and studying the effects of cytochalasin D ( actin depolymerizing agent ) exposure , a model for filamentous virion egress is presented . INTRODUCTION Several medically important enveloped viruses that infect the respiratory tract , such as inﬂuenza ( 1 – 3 ) , respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) ( 4 – 8 ) , and parainﬂuenza ( 9 ) virus , form both spherical and ﬁlamentous virions at the surface of infected cells . This has been observed both in cell culture models with high passage , laboratory strains , and from virus isolated directly from nasopharyngeal secretions or observed in pathology samples ( 7 ) . It has been shown that in inﬂuenza , ﬁlamentous virions have a higher speciﬁc infectivity ( 2 ) , and it has been theorized that the ﬁlamentous virus morphology may be more eﬀective for both infecting cells and evading the host immune responses , particularly in the respiratory tract ( 3 ) . One important question about the ﬁlamentous virion is : What are the mechanisms by which these virions bud from the plasma membrane of an infected cell ? To answer this question , we chose as our model system the A2 strain of human respiratory syncytial virus ( hRSV ) , grown in non - polarized Vero cells . Since many aspects of virion assembly and replication have been studied with RSV , this system is ideal for the study of ﬁlamentous virion egress . To image the live - cell dynamics of the genomic viral ribonucleoprotein ( vRNP ) of hRSV , a molecular beacon ( MB ) - ﬂuorescent probe was designed to target speciﬁcally the vRNA . This allowed for direct observa - tions of both the morphology and mechanics of the processes leading to viral egress within the cellular context . This approach has signiﬁcant advantages over the DIC ( diﬀerential interference contrast ) method used in the previous dynamics study ( 10 ) of RSV , which lacked molecular speciﬁcity and the contrast needed to observe vertically oriented virions . Molecular beacons are dual - labeled , nucleic acid probes with a reporter ﬂuorophore at one end and a quencher at the other . They are designed to form a stem - loop hairpin structure so that ﬂuorescence emission occurs only when the probe hybridizes to a complementary target , resulting in a high signal - to - background ratio ( SBR ) ( 11 ) . Although MBs have been used in limited live - cell mRNA studies ( 12 – 16 ) , their potential for the analysis of viral RNA in living cells has only recently been demonstrated ( 17 , 18 ) . Other methods for imaging RNA in live cells , including the use of ﬂuorescently labeled full - length RNAs or RNPs ( 19 – 22 ) and GFP - fused RNA - binding proteins ( GFP - MS2 ) ( 23 ) , do not allow for the evaluation of unmodiﬁed viral particles . For the imaging experiments , a single chimeric MB , with a DNA backbone stem and 2 0 - O - Methyl RNA backbone hybridization domain , was designed to target a gene - end - intergenic - gene - start sequence , 3 0 - UUU UUA CCC CGU UUA U - 5 0 , that has three exact repeats ( Figure 1A ) ( 24 , 25 ) . Successfully used in antisense experiments ( 24 , 25 ) , this site was considered the most accessible and therefore a prime site for probe hybridiza - tion . Targeting the repeated sequence provided signal ampliﬁcation , resulting in a signiﬁcantly increased SBR . In addition , since the target RNP is concentrated in * To whom correspondence should be addressed .

A 2 0 - O - Methyl RNA / DNA chimera design was used for the MB primarily because of its generally higher SBR ( 26 ) when binding to RNA . This enhanced our ability to observe viral RNA being packaged into ﬁlamentous virion ( SBR ranging from 11 to 30 using chimera versus less than 5 using DNA ) , and is likely due to 2 0 - O - Methyl RNAs higher aﬃnity for RNA than DNA ( 27 – 29 ) . The enhanced nuclease resistance is also a positive feature of using 2 0 - O - Methyl RNA for the hybridization domain ( 28 ) , but we did not ever observe evidence of active probe degradation with DNA or chimera probes . The lack of probe degradation is likely due to the use of streptolysin O - based delivery , which avoids the endocytic pathway ( 12 ) . MATERIALS AND METHODS Cells and virus Vero cells ( ATCC CCL - 81 ) were grown in DMEM ( Sigma Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) with 10 % FBS ( ATCC ) with 100 U / ml of penicillin and 100 mg / ml of streptomycin . Virus used was the A2 strain of RSV ( ATCC VR - 1544 ) at a titer of 1 (cid:1) 10 6 TCID 50 / ml . The titer was evaluated by serial dilution and immunostaining , 4 - days post - infection ( PI ) . All data shown was at day 2 PI and with a multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) of 0 . 5 . At 48 h numerous synctia had formed , but no cell death had occurred . All cells were infected at 80 – 90 % conﬂuence , by removing the media , followed by washing with 1 (cid:1) PBS ( without Ca þ and Mg þ 2 ) , and then adding virus to the cells for 30 min at 37 8 C . After the 30 - min incubation , regular media were added . Figure 1 . Characterization of the vRNPs of hRSV in live cells using molecular beacon imaging .

Nucleic Acids Research , 2007 , Vol . 35 , No . 11 3603 Molecular beacon synthesis and characterization The MB used in this study was a DNA / 2 0 - O - Methyl RNA chimera , 5 0 - Quasar570 - ctcgacg AAAAAUGGGGCAA AUA cgtcgag – BHQ2 - 3 0 ( Biosearch Technologies , Novato , CA ) where the underlined sequences represent the MB stem , lower case are DNA , and the upper case are 2 0 - O - Methyl RNA . The beacon’s SBR ratio in solution ( beacon to target ratio was 1 : 2 in 1 (cid:1) PBS buﬀer ) was measured to be (cid:2) 50 using a Tecan Saﬁre ﬂuorescent platereader . Live - cell molecular beacon delivery Molecular beacons were delivered into infected and uninfected live , Vero cells on day 2 PI using a reversible permeabilization method with streptolysin O ( SLO ) ( Sigma ) . Cells grown in normal medium were ﬁrst washed with serum - free medium and then incubated with a mixture of 0 . 2 U / ml of SLO and 1 m M of MB in an appropriate amount of serum - free medium for 10 min at 37 8 C . The SLO / MB / serum - free medium was then removed and replaced with fresh , normal medium . For live - cell imaging , the cells were imaged via epiﬂuor - escence microscopy , 20 min after incubation in normal growth medium . Using SLO - based delivery , MBs were delivered into Vero cells with (cid:2) 100 % eﬃciency . PCR primers and conditions Total RNA was isolated from infected and non - infected Vero cells , day 2 PI using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Plus kit , as per the manufacturers instructions . Reverse transcription was performed using the Thermoscript reverse transcriptase with typical conditions . Primers called BC6 : 5 0 - TAA TTT TCA GGC TCC ATC TG - 3 0 , and OD1 : 5 0 - TGT TTG ACA ATG ATG AAG TA – 3 0 were used to amplify the gene end - intergenic - gene start region between the viral genes NS1 and NS2 ( 25 ) . The cycle conditions were as follows : stage 1 : 95 8 C 5 min 1 (cid:1) ; stage 2 : 95 8 C 30 s ; 58 8 C for 45 s ; 72 8 C 90 s stage 3 : 72 8 C 10 min 1 (cid:1) , using the Invitrogen Thermoscript RT - PCR system with Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase . Simultaneous labeling In order to verify MB hybridization to vRNA during virion assembly , Vero cells , 2 - day PI , were simultaneously labeled with both MBs for the vRNA of hRSV and with a monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) ( Abcam RSV3206 ) for the hRSV F protein . Infected cells were live - cell labeled with the hRSV speciﬁc MB as discussed above . Thirty minutes after live - cell MB hybridization , cells were ﬁxed with room temperature ( RT ) 4 % paraformaldehyde ( Electron Microscopy Sciences , Hatﬁeld , PA ) in nuclease free PBS for 10 min . They were then washed twice with 1 (cid:1) PBS and incubated in 5 % RNase - free BSA ( Fisher Scientiﬁc , Horsham , PA ) in 1 (cid:1) PBS for 60 min at RT . They were then washed twice with 1 (cid:1) PBS and incubated with a 1 : 500 dilution of mAb RSV3206 ( Abcam , Cambridge , MA ) for 60 min at RT . After being washed twice with 1 (cid:1) PBS for 5 min , the cells were then incubated with a 1 : 400 dilution of Alexa 488 - goat - anti - mouse IgG secondary antibody ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) . Cells were then washed twice with 1 (cid:1) PBS , mounted in Zymed clearmount and imaged . This procedure was repeated when labeling vRNA and lipid rafts , except 30 min after live - cell MB hybridization , the Vybrant Lipid Raft Labeling Kit from Invitrogen was used as per the manufacturers’ instructions on the live cells , ﬁxed with 4 % paraformaldehyde , and then imaged . For staining vRNA and myosin Va , the vRNA was labeled in live - cells with the MB as mentioned above , ﬁxed as mentioned above , but in addition were perme - abilized 0 . 1 % Triton X in 1 (cid:1) PBS for 3 min , followed by a 1 (cid:1) PBS wash after ﬁxation . The primary antibody used was a rabbit polyclonal to myosin Va ( Santa Cruz Biotech , Santa Cruz , CA ) at a 1 : 100 dilution in PBS ; the secondary antibody used was an Alexa 488 - goat - anti - rabbit IgG ( Invitrogen ) . Cytochalasin D treatment In order to further understand the role of actin in the dynamics of viral genomic RNPs , MBs were delivered into Vero cells 2 - day PI . Thirty minutes after MB delivery the cell media were removed and replaced with their normal growth media with 3 m g / ml of cytochalasin - D bodipy FL ( Invitrogen ) . Time - lapse epiﬂuorescence imaging of the cells was performed at 37 8 C and 5 % CO2 , immediately after the media were changed for (cid:2) 15 min . Out of focus light was removed using ImageJ ‘background subtraction’ in order to improve the contrast of the ﬁlaments shown . No other alterations were performed . 3D reconstructions Fixed cell images ( in 4 % paraformaldehyde in 1 (cid:1) PBS ) of vRNPs or vRNP / myosin Va co - stained samples were imaged using a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta confocal micro - scope with a 100X Plan - Neoﬂuor objective ( NA ¼ 1 . 3 ) . The pinhole for the confocal microscopy was set such that each image is 0 . 5 m m thick , with 0 . 5 m m between images , and up to 31 images ( (cid:2) 15 m m in the z direction ) were taken . Bitplane was utilized to reconstruct the z - stack images . This enabled the actual length of the vRNPs to be measured , not just the 2D projection length . Live - cell imaging All of the live - cell imaging performed was with a Zeiss Axiovert 200 epiﬂuorescence microscope equipped with an internal shutter , and a Zeiss Axiocam MRm cooled CCD camera . Control of the internal shutter and image acquisition was performed using Zeiss Axiovision 4 . 4 . Chroma ﬁlter sets 41007a and 49002 were used to image the Quasar570 and Alexa 488 ﬂuorescence , respectively . All images were taken with a 100X EC - Plan - Neoﬂuor objective ( NA ¼ 1 . 3 ) . Fixed cell imaging was performed in 4 - well , Nunc Labtek II chambered coverslips ( # 1 . 5 ) , while all live - cell imaging was performed with Bioptechs DeltaT black dishes with a # 1 . 5 coverslip for a bottom . The live cells were kept at 37 8 C using the Bioptechs DeltaT4 system and objective heater , and in a 5 % CO 2 in air environments via a port in the heated lid of the DeltaT4 system . 3604 Nucleic Acids Research , 2007 , Vol . 35 , No . 11 Image analysis was performed using ImageJ ( NIH ) v . 1 . 33u , or using Bitplane by Imaris . ImageJ was utilized to produce the image sequence data from the time - lapse images of vRNP dynamics , and to false color the images . The only modiﬁcation to the time - lapse images was the mapping of the 8 - bit gray scale to the ‘ﬁre’ color maps in ImageJ . No other changes to the images were performed . SBR measurements were performed with the background intensities of both the non - infected and infected cells being the same value . Only linear changes were made to equilibrate their backgrounds . In addition , ImageJ and Bitplane were used to analyze the motion of vRNPs and the length of ﬁlamentous vRNPs . This information was then used in Microsoft Excel to calculate the mean square displacement ( MSD ) of the vRNPs as a function of time , and the ﬁlament length distribution . RESULTS Molecular beacons were delivered into a conﬂuent monolayer of Vero cells 2 - day PI with the A2 strain of hRSV , as well as non - infected Vero cells , using reversible cell membrane permeabilization with streptolysin O ( 12 ) , in order to determine both the speciﬁcity of the MB probe ( 17 ) and characterize the morphologies of the vRNPs . As seen in Figure 1B , infected cells exhibited strong ﬂuorescence with signal concentrated in spherical inclu - sion bodies ( average SBR of 80 ) and individual viral ﬁlaments ( average SBR of 11 ) , while the non - infected cells were quite dark , demonstrating excellent probe speciﬁcity . The infection was conﬁrmed using PCR ; infected cells exhibited a very high level of hRSV amplicon , unlike the non - infected cells ( Figure 1C ) . To demonstrate probe accessibility for vRNPs that were in the process of being packaged , we ﬁxed the hRSV - infected cells after delivering MBs , and then co - stained for the RSV F protein with indirect immunoﬂuorescence . The F or fusion protein is a membrane glycoprotein that mediates viral fusion and entry , and also promotes fusion of the infected cell membrane with adjacent cell membranes , leading to the formation of syncytia . We observed signiﬁcant image overlap of the ﬁlamentous MB signal with that from the anti - F - protein antibody on the surface of the cells , indicating that MBs can bind to vRNPs localized to the inside of the plasma membrane in the midst of the packaging process ( Figure 1D ) . In addition , the F protein and MB signal colocalization implies that the RNPs are located throughout the ﬁlament . In order to better describe the morphologies observed using MB imaging in the infected cells , 30 min after MB delivery , the cells were ﬁxed , imaged with confocal microscopy and later reconstructed in three dimensions using Imaris Bitplane . In Figure 2A , four images showing only the ﬂuorescent information at distances greater than 12 , 8 , 4 and 0 m m from the glass surface are shown . The 0 m m view represents all of the signal from the bound MBs within the infected cells displayed in two dimensions ; the cross section is (cid:2) 15 m m thick from the coverglass to the tops of the viral ﬁlaments ( as represented by the ﬂuorescent signal ) . Both cytoplasmic inclusions and viral ﬁlaments are easily viewed and measured , with the upper 3 m m ( perpendicular to the image plane ) dominated by ﬁlaments . In Figure 2B , one XZ and YZ cross section are shown . In these cross - sectional views , the ﬁlaments are easily seen protruding from the curved , apical side of the cells , while the inclusions are distributed throughout the cytoplasm , but often closer to the apical membrane Figure 2 .

Two examples of connected ﬁlaments are indicated by the white circles . ( C ) Plot of ﬁlament length distribution . Nucleic Acids Research , 2007 , Vol . 35 , No . 11 3605 than the coverslip . The ﬁlament lengths from the 3D reconstructions were measured in Bitplane , and the distribution is plotted in Figure 2C . The distribution is log - normal , ranging from (cid:2) 2 . 6 to 8 . 1 m m , with an average ﬁlament length of 4 . 6 m m and a SD of 1 . 54 m m . This is very consistent with prior measurements of ﬁlament length measured using electron microscopy ; Armstrong et al . ( 4 ) quoted lengths up to 2 . 5 m m , Norrby et al . ( 8 ) greater than 2 m m , Bachi and Howe ( 5 ) up to 10 m m , Berthiaume et al . ( 6 ) up to 5 m m , and measurements by Roberts et al . ( 7 ) quoted a range from 4 to 8 m m . In addition , we found that some ﬁlamentous vRNPs ( Figure 2B , white circles ) are connected at one end , with average angles of (cid:2) 71 . 4 (cid:3) 3 . 5 8 , which is very similar to morphologies formed by the actin network near the plasma membrane ( 30 , 31 ) . Time - lapse imaging experiments were performed on Vero cells , 2 - day PI , in order to observe the dynamics leading to virion egress . Images of infected cells were taken using 100 – 200 ms exposures , with 5 s between exposures for up to 15 min , after which photobleaching became signiﬁcant . Twelve image sequences were taken per experiment and 10 experiments were performed , yielding 120 time - lapse movies . After analyzing the movie sequences , three primary modes of motion were identiﬁed : ( i ) ﬁlament projection and rotation , ( ii ) migra - tion , and ( iii ) non - directed motion . As shown in Figure 3A and Supplementary Movie 1 , ﬁlamentous vRNPs on the surface of the cells rotated dramatically on one end after a period of little motion . A quantitative analysis indicated that the vRNPs in Figure 3A exhibited little rotation for (cid:2) 250 s , then rapidly rotated to a near vertical position relative to the cell membrane within 50 s ( Figure 3B ) . The average rate of rotation after the vRNPs appeared to separate from the membrane was (cid:2) 1 . 67 8 / s . Once the vRNPs became vertical , they either continued to rotate rapidly ( Figure 3C and Supplementary Movie 2 ) , with a rate (cid:4) 6 8 / s , or they migrated over short distances , exhibiting the second mode of motion observed ( migra - tion ) . It should be noted that the ﬁlamentous groups of vRNPs observed while rotating are ﬂexible in nature . An example of a ﬂexible ﬁlament can be observed in Figure 3D , panel two ( 5 s , where the ﬁlament appears ‘bent’ ) , and panel three ( 10 s , where the ﬁlament appears curved ) and in Supplementary Movie 2 . The ﬂexibility of RSV nucleocapsids has previously been noted ( 32 ) , but were not observed in real - time during the egress process . A typical example of the migration mode can be seen in Figure 4A and Supplementary Movie 3 , where a vertically oriented vRNP migrated (cid:2) 2 . 8 m m in 50 s ; the path of the vRNP is plotted in Figure 4B . Prior to and after this migration , the particle is static . The path taken by the particle is very similar in morphology to that of lipid rafts ( see inset in Figure 4B ) as imaged using an Alexa 488 - labeled cholera toxin probe . We hypothesize that the raft acts as a guide for the particle path , which is consistent with the observation that vRNP packaging occurs in the lipid rafts ( 33 – 36 ) . The speeds observed of (cid:2) 25 migrating ﬁlaments ranged from (cid:2) 29 . 5 to 102 nm / s with an average speed of 56 nm / s , while the path lengths traveled ranged from (cid:2) 1 to 4 m m , with an average path length of 2 . 36 (cid:3) 0 . 9 m m . The speeds measured are commensurate with myosin transport ( 37 ) ; myosin has been implicated in RSV viral protein traﬃcking ( 38 ) and given the connection between lipid rafts and the actin network ( 39 ) , myosin - driven transport likely plays a role in RSV virion egress . In addition , many vRNPs exhibited non - directed motion over periods greater than 15 min , as illustrated in Figure 4C and Supplementary Movie 4 ( A control video , where MBs were delivered into non - infected Vero cells , can be seen in Supplementary Movie 5 ) . In order to compare the motion seen in Figure 4A with that observed in 4C , and gain insight into the nature of the motion , the MSD or r 2 (cid:1) (cid:2) of each trajectory was calculated ( Figure 4D ) . It was determined that for the motion in Figure 4A , the MSD ( Figure 4D ) , could be ﬁt by a parabola ( [ r 2 (cid:1) (cid:2) ¼ 4 Dt þ ( vt ) 2 ] , where D ¼ 0 . 0033 m m 2 / s , and v ¼ 29 . 05 nm / s , with an R 2 ¼ 0 . 984 , representing directed motion ; while the motion in Figure 4C could be ﬁt ( R 2 ¼ 0 . 7 ) by a power law function r 2 (cid:1) (cid:2) ¼ 4 Dt a , where 4 D ¼ 0 . 013 and a ¼ 0 . 78 ( R 2 ¼ 0 . 7 ) , which is between 0 . 5 5a5 0 . 9 representing anomalous diﬀusion or obstructed diﬀusion ( 22 , 40 , 41 ) . The calculations shown in Figure 4D are for the particles shown , but are representative of the populations exhibiting these modes of motion . In Figure 4E , the fraction of ﬁlaments exhibiting each mode of motion is presented . Approximately 36 % exhibit projection and rotation , 12 % migration and 52 % non - directed motion . DISCUSSION Role of actin and myosin In the previous section , evidence of the directed motion of the RSV ﬁlamentous vRNPs was presented . This evidence , in conjunction with previous studies of RSV ﬁlaments ( 34 – 36 , 42 – 46 ) , points to motor driven transport on the cytoskeleton as the likely driver of the observed migratory motion , and possibly the rotational motion . Previous studies of RSV have demonstrated that actin ﬁlaments ( 42 , 46 ) and their growth , mediated by proﬁlin ( 43 ) and rhoA activation ( 44 ) , are vital to virion egress . In many of those studies , infected cells were exposed to cytoskeletal depolymerizing agents . The amount of free virion or viral RNA in the cell culture media , or changes in virion morphology , as measured via immunoﬂuorescence imaging , were used to gauge the eﬀect of these agents on virion egress . In previous studies , actin depolymerization via cytochalasin D had the most adverse eﬀects on virion egress , therefore making actin / myosin the most likely cytoskeletal / motor combination involved in the motion observed in our investigation . In addition , since assembly occurs at the lipid rafts and the rafts are linked to the actin network ( 39 ) , depolymerzing them should eﬀect the observed motion . Live - cell MB hybridization , cell ﬁxation and permeabil - ization , followed by immunostaining of myosin Va , and confocal microscopy imaging was performed in order to conﬁrm the presence and possible role of myosin . Myosin V has previously been implicated in traﬃcking messenger RNP ( 47 ) , granules on the actin network near 3606 Nucleic Acids Research , 2007 , Vol . 35 , No . 11 the plasma membrane ( 48 ) , and RSV proteins to the apical membrane in polarized cells ( 38 ) . The results from our simultaneous labeling experiments can be seen in Figure 5 , where the blue represents myosin Va , the red represents vRNPs ( hybridized MBs ) and the purple represents their colocalization . In Figure 5A , like Figure 2A , four images showing only the ﬂuorescence information at distances greater than 9 , 6 , 3 and 0 m m from the glass surface are shown . The 0 m m view represents all of the ﬂuorescent signal from within the infected cells , displayed in two dimensions ; the cross section is (cid:2) 12 m m thick from the coverglass to the tops of the viral ﬁlaments . In Figure 5B , XZ and YZ cross - sectional views are shown , with crossed lines representing where they were taken in the XY plane . Figure 3 . Time - lapse ﬂuorescent imaging of the rotational dynamics of hRSV ﬁlamentous vRNPs . ( A ) Time series of the dynamics of vRNPs ( white box ) , exhibiting the projection and rotation mode of motion . ( B ) Quantiﬁcation of rotation angle ; after 250s of very limited motion , the virion rapidly rotates to near vertical ( represented by the vertical black line ) , possibly separating much of it from the plasma membrane . The angle measurement was made relative to the vRNPs initial position at the cell membrane . The initial position was conﬁrmed via ﬂuorescence imaging to be at the cell membrane , via the vRNPs colocalization with the lipid rafts ( data not shown ) . ( C ) Once the vRNPs are vertical , two types of motion were observed , violent rotation ( see Supplementary Movie 2 ) or migration . A time series of the rapid rotation of packaged vRNPs is shown here ; where within 15s , the vRNPs pictured here rotate 69 . 4 8 . ( D ) The ﬂexibility of RSV ﬁlaments is shown in this time - lapse sequence . The RSV ﬁlament appears both ‘bent’ and exhibits curvature at both 5 and 10s from the initial time of observation . Nucleic Acids Research , 2007 , Vol . 35 , No . 11 3607 From the data in Figure 5A and B , it can be seen that the ﬁlaments are largely distributed along the apical surface , and that they colocalize well with myosin Va ( purple color ) . Throughout the volume of the cell monolayer , both myosin Va ( blue ) , represented as small dots , and vRNPs ( MB , red ) , predominately in cytoplasmic inclusions , do not colocalize and appear independent . It is clear from this ﬁgure that the strongest colocalization occurs predominately in the ﬁlaments and near the surface of the monolayer , implicating myosin Va’s role in the assembly and egress process . Vero cells 2 - day PI and hybridized with RSV targeted MBs , were exposed to cytochalasin D , an actin depoly - merising agent , in order to provide further evidence for the role of actin on the vRNP morphology and dynamics . We observed that many ﬁlamentous vRNPs exposed to cytochalasin D , tended to aggregate and form circular , inclusion - like structures of vRNPs within (cid:2) 1 min ( Figure 6A and Supplementary Movie 6 ) . Two minutes later , these circular aggregates tended to move from the surface of the cell into the cell cytoplasm . After 15 min , almost all of the vRNPs had separated from the cell surface and were concentrated in granules . In Figure 6B , a typical syncytia is shown ; high concentrations of ﬁlamentous structures surround the syncytia , while a lower density of ﬁlaments and particles lie along the apical membrane . However , as shown in Figure 6C , a syncytia 15 min after cytochalasin D exposure composed of predominately circular granules . This experiment helps conﬁrm ﬁlamentous actin’s role in governing vRNP morphology , and explain why virion egress is decreased when actin ﬁlaments are depolymerized . From the data presented in this investigation and from previous studies , we hypothesize that actin ﬁlaments and myosin - driven motion are the root cause of the motion observed , and such motion is mechanically separating the packaged vRNPs from the actin network , thus allowing them to leave the cell . Biophysical model of virion egress In order to further explain the observed dynamics of ﬁlamentous vRNPs in live cells , we propose a biophysical model . Presented in Figure 7A – D are sketches of the possible actin network / nucleocapsid interactions for all three types of motion discussed above . Figure 7A and B represents how vRNP rotation might be achieved . Myosin motors , attached to the vRNP and moving along the actin network , could cause the virion to ﬂip up on one end ( Figure 3A ) , given that actin ﬁlaments are quite ﬂexible . It is possible that this motion frees much of the virion from the plasma membrane , allowing for more rigorous rotation ( Figure 3C ) or migration ( Figure 4A ) . The rigorous rotation may cause the separation of daughter actin strands within the virion from mother strands at the Arp2 / 3 interface ( 31 , 49 ) . The dissociation Figure 4 .

( C ) A time series of vRNPs exhibiting non - directed motion or anomalous diﬀusion is shown . ( D ) Plot of the mean square displacement ( MSD ) or r 2 (cid:1) (cid:2) of trajectories presented in ( A ) and ( C ) . The MSD of ( A ) was ﬁt with a parabola , representing directed motion ; while for the motion in ( C ) could be ﬁt by a power law ﬁt with an exponential value between 0 . 5 and 0 . 9 representing anomalous diﬀusion or obstructed diﬀusion . ( E ) Plot of the relative fraction of ﬁlaments exhibiting each of the three types of motion observed . 3608 Nucleic Acids Research , 2007 , Vol . 35 , No . 11 constant for Arp2 / 3 with the mother strand is (cid:2) 50 times higher than with the daughter strand , and thus the weakest part of the structure ( 37 ) . This separation would then allow the virion to leave the cell . The initiation of migration ( Figure 4A ) may be the result of myosin motors as a part of the virion , and their intermittent function once the vRNPs are physically separated from the actin network . This is supported by our observation of myosin Va colocalization with vRNPs ( see Figure 5A and B ) . Non - directed motion or anomalous diﬀusion ( Figure 4C ) may occur for several reasons ; for example , if vRNPs lack the ATP necessary to cause directed motion or if the vRNPs are separated from the actin network via the ADF / coﬁlin mechanism ( 31 ) too early and not by mechanical motion , they may be left trapped within the Figure 5 . Simultaneous imaging of vRNPs and Myosin Va . ( A ) Four images showing only the ﬂuorescence information at distances greater than 9 , 6 , 3 and 0 m m from the glass surface are shown . The cross section is 12 m m thick from the coverglass to the tops of the ﬁlaments . Myosin Va is represented in blue , vRNPs in red and the colocalization in purple . ( B ) XZ and YZ cross - sectional views . The ﬁlaments are largely distributed along the apical surface , and colocalize with myosin Va . Throughout the volume of the cell monolayer , myosin Va , small dots and vRNPs , predominately in cytoplasmic inclusions , do not colocalize and appear independent . Figure 6 . Actin’s role in vRNP dynamics and morphology . ( A ) Seven images representing the time - lapse eﬀects of cytochalasin D on the morphology and location of ﬁlamentous vRNPs . Initially ﬁlamentous vRNPs tended to aggregate and form circular aggregates within 1min of exposure to media containing cytochalasin D . By 3min , these circular aggregates , tended to move from the surface of the cell into the cell cytoplasm . ( B ) Representative example of a typical syncytia , showing high concentrations of ﬁlamentous structures around the outside of the syncytia and a lower concentration along the apical surface . ( C ) Representative image of a syncytia after cytochalasin D exposure , composed of predominately circular granules . Figure 7 . Hypothesized biophysical model of vRNP motion . ( A ) Active myosin V motor proteins , attached to both the viral genomic RNP and the actin network , cause the rotation of the virion and partial separation from the plasma membrane , via their translation along the actin network . ( B and C ) Once the virion is partially free from the cell surface due to vigorous motion ( B ) , motor motion could possibly cause daughter actin ﬁlaments within the virion to break from the mother ﬁlaments at the Arp2 / 3 protein complex , allowing for rigorous rotation ( Figure 3C and Supplementary Movie 2 ) or ( C ) migration along the actin network ( Figure 4A and Supplementary Movie 3 ) . ( D ) Some particles exhibit ‘non - directed’ or obstructed diﬀusion ( Figure 3C and Supplementary Movie 4 ) , possibly due to the action of the ADF / coﬁlin complex leaving it embedded in the membrane without the actin network / motors to propel it from the cell . Nucleic Acids Research , 2007 , Vol . 35 , No . 11 3609 plasma membrane . It is also possible that these virions were released from an infected cell earlier and reabsorbed , or they are involved in genome replication , and not competent for egress . Future studies of the protein / vRNP interactions at the membrane are required to reveal the exact reasons of the non - directed motions , and identify conclusively the proteins involved in this process .
