Cells at a density of 1 × 10 4 cells / well were plated into 96 - well culture plate in experimental medium . The cells were allowed to adhere to the well overnight then respective concentrations of PCAIs ( 0 . 5 , 1 , 2 , 5 , 10 , 20 , 50 μM ) were treated into the cells in four replicates for each concentration . Bright field images were obtained using Nikon Eclipse microscope at 10x magnification .
