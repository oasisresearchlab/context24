New and recurrent AAGAB mutations in punctate palmoplantar keratoderma DOI : 10 . 1111 / bjd . 12927 D EAR E DITOR , Punctate palmoplantar keratoderma type I ( PPPK1 ; also known as Buschke - Fischer - Brauer type ; OMIM 148600 ) is an autosomal dominant disorder of keratinization , character - ized by multiple hyperkeratotic lesions on the palms and soles that usually start in early adolescence but may also start later in life . 1 Lesions increase in size and number with advancing age and may coalesce over pressure points to form larger pla - ques . Recently , two consecutive studies identiﬁed the causative gene for PPPK1 as AAGAB , 2 , 3 located on chromosome 15q23 , a locus to which the causal gene for PPPK1 was previously mapped . 4 Subsequently , further mutations in AAGAB were described in families from several countries worldwide . 5 – 11 In this study , we investigated ﬁve European families with a clini - cal diagnosis of PPPK1 . This work was conducted in accor - dance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki . Blood was obtained following written informed consent and DNA extracted using standard protocols . Polymerase chain reaction ampliﬁcation and Sanger sequencing to screen all exons and exon / intron boundaries of AAGAB was done as described previously . 3 The 31 - year - old proband from family 1 , a four - generation family of Swiss origin ( Fig . 1a ) , presented with small , horny nails and hyperkeratosis of the palms and soles . Age of onset was 7 years . Discrete punctate lesions were observed along the lateral edge of the plantar surface , with more extensive hyperkeratosis over the heels ( Fig . 1b ) . Peeling skin was observed in the interdigital webspaces of the feet . The proband’s father displayed extensive hyperkeratotic (cid:3) 2014 The Authors .

She presented with a 1 - year history of worsening hyperkeratosis affecting primarily her soles . Small hyperkeratotic lesions were seen on her ﬁngers but not on her palms . Both her children were affected , with hyperkerato - sis developing at a much younger age than in herself . Her two brothers were similarly affected , and her deceased father was reported to have been affected . A recurrent heterozygous nonsense mutation , p . Trp47 * ; c . 140G > A , 3 , 5 within the N - terminal domain of p34 ( Fig . 2e ) , was identiﬁed in the proband . The other three families studied were apparently unrelated Danish kindreds . The 44 - year - old proband of family 3 ( Fig . 2a ) developed dry palmar skin in her childhood progressing to punctate keratosis on the palms ( Fig . 2b ) and subsequently the soles . Haematoxylin and eosin staining of a biopsy from palmar skin ( Fig . 2c ) showed compact orthokera - tosis with pronounced hyperkeratosis . A central dermal depression characteristic for punctate palmoplantar keratoder - ma was observed . A recurrent heterozygous nonsense muta - tion Arg124 * ; c . 370C > T 2 was identiﬁed in the proband and four other affected members of this four - generation kin - dred ( Fig . 2a ) . PPPK1 was reported in four generations of family 4 ( Fig . 2a ) . The proband , a 53 - year - old Danish female developed PPPK1 at 18 – 20 years of age . It gradually became worse , especially at pressure points on the feet ( Fig . 2d ) where punctate lesions coalesced . The palms and volar sides of the ﬁngers were affected to a lesser degree . The same p . Arg124 * mutation as in family 3 was identiﬁed in the pro - band , her affected daughter , son and aunt but not in an unaf - fected sister ( Fig . 2a ) . In family 5 , PPPK1 developed around the age of 20 years and progressed thereafter in the 68 - year - old Danish proband . She presented with severe , very painful punctate palmoplantar keratoderma on the pressure points of her soles . Palms were also affected with multiple 3 – 5 - mm punctate keratosis . Heterozygous nonsense mutation p . Arg124 * was also identiﬁed in this individual . Three unaf - fected members did not carry the mutation ( Fig . 2a ) . PPPK1 , an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by multiple hyperkeratotic lesions on the palms and soles , can vary in severity from mild to severe , and can be painful and socially debilitating . Recently , mutations have been described in the AAGAB gene , which encodes the a - and c - adaptin bind - ing protein p34 , and has been proposed to have a role in skin integrity . 2 p34 has been functionally implicated in the intra - cellular transport of clathrin - coated vesicles , 3 and may affect cell signalling via regulation of the expression of receptor tyrosine kinases , which are turned over by clathrin - and AP2 - dependant mechanisms . 3 , 5 , 12 , 13 Recently a mutation was reported in AAGAB in a Jewish family of Dutch origin with PPPK1 co - segregating with congenital dislocation of the hip . 10 Whether this is a coincidence or if AAGAB has an as yet unknown role in skeletal development is unclear . This study has revealed one novel , p . Gln88 * , and two recurrent , p . Trp47 * and p . Arg124 * , mutations . This brings the total to 27 distinct loss - of - function mutations reported in AAGAB ( Fig . 2e ) , providing further evidence for this being the causative gene for PPPK1 .

Body mass index , waist circumference and HOMA - IR correlate with the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index in patients with psoriasis receiving phototherapy DOI : 10 . 1111 / bjd . 12914 D EAR E DITOR , An increased incidence of obesity in patients with psoriasis has been documented in cross - sectional studies of large healthcare databases and case – control studies . 1 – 7 Obesity , and in particular centripetal obesity , confers a risk of develop - ing insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes , which in turn increases the risk of cardiovascular disease . Since 1978 it has been known that patients with psoriasis have higher rates of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease and it is likely that this is driven by obesity and concomitant insulin resistance . We undertook a study to establish the effect of body mass index ( BMI ) , abdominal obesity and insulin resistance on pso - riasis severity and Framingham risk . Following ethical approval , consecutive patients with psoriasis , aged ≥ 18 years , were recruited prior to commencing phototherapy or photo - chemotherapy ( TL - 01 or psoralen plus ultraviolet A ) between October 2008 and July 2011 . Patients had a full physical examination and the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index ( PASI ) score was recorded . Height , weight and waist circumference were measured for each patient . The BMI was calculated using the formula : weight in kg / ( height in m ) 2 . Obesity was deﬁned as a BMI > 30 , overweight as BMI 25 – 30 and lean as a BMI < 25 according to the World Health Organization deﬁ - nition of obesity . Systolic blood pressure was measured using a sphygmomanometer on the left brachial artery . Fasting blood samples were taken for the measurement of insulin , glucose and serum cholesterol . Insulin resistance was mea - sured using the homeostasis model with the formula : insulin 9 glucose / 22 (cid:1) 5 ( HOMA - IR , homeostatic model assessment – insulin resistance ) . Framingham risk was calculated using MedCalc (cid:1) ( MedCalc Software , Ostend , Belgium ) . Results were analysed using GraphPad Prism ( GraphPad Software Inc . , La Jolla , CA , U . S . A . ) , using Student’s t - test , ANOVA and Pearson’s rank correlation . A total of 103 patients were recruited from the photothera - py department [ mean age 40 years ( range 21 – 69 ) ; mean PASI 9 (cid:1) 6 ( range 3 – 22 (cid:1) 8 ) ; 52 male and 51 female ] . When categorized according to their BMI into lean ( BMI < 25 kg m (cid:3) 2 ) , overweight ( BMI 25 – 30 kg m (cid:3) 2 ) and obese ( BMI > 30 kg m (cid:3) 2 ) , 30 % of the patients due to commence photo - therapy were obese . Obese patients had signiﬁcantly more severe psoriasis than the lean or overweight patients when cat - egorized according to BMI ( n = 96 , P = 0 (cid:1) 002 ) or according to waist circumference ( n = 90 , P = 0 (cid:1) 03 ) ( Fig . 1 ) . There was a signiﬁcant correlation between BMI and PASI in patients prior to phototherapy ( n = 97 , r = 0 (cid:1) 33 , P = 0 (cid:1) 001 ) ( Fig . 2 ) . When factors such as alcohol , smoking and stress were controlled for in a multiple regression analy - sis , the relationship between BMI and PASI remained signiﬁ - cant ( P = 0 (cid:1) 0005 ) . PASI was also associated with waist circumference ( n = 103 , r = 0 (cid:1) 34 , P = 0 (cid:1) 0009 ) . Abdominal obesity is associated with diabetes , which has an increased prevalence in patients with psoriasis . PASI was associated with fasting insulin ( n = 85 , r = 0 (cid:1) 48 , P = 0 (cid:1) 001 ) and insulin resistance as measured using HOMA - IR ( n = 64 , r = 0 (cid:1) 48 , P = 0 (cid:1) 001 ) in patients receiving phototherapy . Patients with a diagnosis of diabetes were excluded from this analysis . There was also a positive correlation between Framingham risk and BMI using Pearson’s correlation ( n = 89 , r = 0 (cid:1) 24 , P = 0 (cid:1) 02 ) PASI - Phototherapy Lean Overweight Obese 0 5 10 15 7·7 9·6 11·4 N = 96 P = 0·002 P A S I Waist circumference Lean Obese 0 5 10 15 N = 90 P = 0·03 P A S I ( a ) ( b ) Fig 1 .
