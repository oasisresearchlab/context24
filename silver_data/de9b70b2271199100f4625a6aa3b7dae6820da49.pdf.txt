Email : ludger . johannes @ curie . fr S UMMARY It is commonly assumed that the glycan makeup of glycoproteins that reach the cell surface is final and static . Here , we challenge this notion by the discovery of a molecular switch that 5 induces acute and reversible changes of glycans on the plasma membrane . We demonstrate that within minutes , the epidermal growth factor triggers the galectin - driven endocytosis of cell surface glycoproteins , such as integrins , that are key regulators of cell adhesion and migration . The onset of this process , mediated by the Na + / H + antiporter NHE - 1 and the neuraminidases Neu1 / 3 , requires the pH - triggered enzymatic removal of sialic acids 10 whose presence otherwise prevents galectin binding . Desialylated glycoproteins are then retrogradely transported to the Golgi apparatus where their glycan makeup is reset , and their function is repurposed to regulate EGF - dependent invasive cell migration . Glycosylation at the cell surface thereby emerges as a dynamic and reversible regulatory post - translational modification that controls a highly adaptable trafficking pathway . 15 K EYWORDS Glycosylation , sialic acid , GL - Lect driven endocytosis , cell migration I NTRODUCTION Growth factors engage cell surface receptors and trigger signaling events with wide cellular ramifications ( Avraham and Yarden , 2011 ; Lemmon and Schlessinger , 2010 ) , including 20 effects on the glycosylation machinery and the glycosylation state of de novo synthesized proteins ( Gao et al . , 2021 ; Gilmour et al . , 2013 ; Marsico et al . , 2018 ; Palmisano et al . , 2011 ; Stanley , 2011 ; Takahashi et al . , 2016 ; Zhao et al . , 2008 ) . The possibility that growth factors affect glycans at the plasma membrane has been largely overlooked . The glycan makeup of glycoproteins that reach the cell surface is indeed generally considered to be set . 25 Nonetheless , we here present a novel regulatory circuit based on growth factor - induced acute and reversible changes in glycans of cell surface glycoproteins which in turn repurposes their functions . We describe the discovery of a signal transduction pathway that links growth factor signaling to the modulation of galectin - driven clathrin - independent endocytosis through the triggered 30 removal of terminal sialic acid ( Sia ) residues from N - glycans on cargo client proteins . In addition to the well explored clathrin pathway ( Kaksonen and Roux , 2018 ; Kirchhausen et al . , 2014 ; McMahon and Boucrot , 2011 ; Sorkin , 2004 ) , mechanisms for building endocytic pits without clathrin have emerged more recently ( Doherty and McMahon , 2009 ; Johannes et al . , 2015 ; Renard and Boucrot , 2021 ; Sandvig et al . , 2018 ; Sigismund et al . , 2021 ) . One of 35 the drivers are galectins , a large family of proteins ( Cummings et al . , 2022 ; Johannes et al . , 2018 ) whose glycan - binding properties are greatly influenced by the degree of sialylation and the type of Sia linkage ( α 2 - 3 or α 2 - 6 ) ( Leffler and Barondes , 1986 ; Stowell et al . , 2008 ; Zhuo and Bellis , 2011 ) . Therefore , Sia capping of glycoproteins and glycolipids enhances or inhibits galectin binding interactions with wide biological effects ( Läubli and Varki , 2020 ; 40 Varki and Gagneux , 2012 ) . Amongst others , galectins tune the cell surface dynamics of glycoproteins through lattice formation ( Nabi et al . , 2015 ; Partridge et al . , 2004 ; Rabinovich et al . , 2007 ) and glycolipid - lectin ( GL - Lect ) driven endocytosis ( Johannes et al . , 2016 ; Lakshminarayan et al . , 2014 ; Renard et al . , 2020 ) in an intertwined manner that requires further in - depth investigation ( Mathew and Donaldson , 2018 ) . 45 We show that signal transduction between the archetypical epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) and the membrane sialidases ( neuraminidases , Neu ) that catalyze desialylation , involves a previously unrecognized acidification - dependent reaction at the cell surface . Among others , we identify integrins as substrates of EGF - induced desiaylation . Integrins are 3 heterodimeric transmembrane proteins composed of one α and one β subunit that bind directly to the extracellular matrix ( Bridgewater et al . , 2012 ; Marsico et al . , 2018 ; Moreno - Layseca et al . , 2019 ) . ST6GAL1 - catalyzed sialic acid modification ( i . e . , α 2 - 6 sialylation ) has been associated in physiological and pathological conditions with integrin activation , fibronectin affinity modulation , and cell migration ( Hou et al . , 2016 ; Pan and Song , 2010 ; 5 Pretzlaff et al . , 2000 ; Seales et al . , 2005 ) . Of note , endocytic trafficking of integrins has been shown to be important for their activities ( Moreno - Layseca et al . , 2019 ) . Here , we demonstrate that following EGF - induced desialylation , integrins are transported via the retrograde route to the Golgi apparatus , whereupon their glycan makeup is reset by resialylation and their functions repurposed by polarized secretion to the leading edge to 10 support invasive cell migration . Based on these findings , we propose a model , termed the desialylation glycoswitch , by which extracellular cues are relayed to galectin - driven endocytic processes and transduced into pathophysiological responses through the acute remodeling of cell surface glycans . R ESULTS 15 Growth factors trigger desialylation Galectin - 3 ( Gal3 ) is the best characterized driver of an uptake process that has been termed glycolipid - lectin ( GL - Lect ) driven endocytosis ( Johannes et al . , 2016 ) . For this , oligomerization competent Gal3 reorganizes glycoproteins and glycosphingolipids in a way that triggers the biogenesis of tubular endocytic pits from which clathrin - independent 20 endocytic carriers ( CLICs ) emerge ( Johannes et al . , 2016 ; Renard and Boucrot , 2021 ) . To study if the GL - Lect process is regulated by growth factor signaling , we measured exogenous Gal3 binding to MDA - MB - 231 breast cancer cells incubated in the presence of saturating concentrations ( 100 ng / mL ) of a panel of growth factors ( Figure 1A ) . These incubations were performed at 4 °C where endocytosis is inhibited but growth factors 25 continue to signal ( de Melker et al . , 2001 ; Stang et al . , 2004 ) . Gal3 binding to cells was significantly increased after treatment with several growth factors , including EGF and TGF α , both ligands of EGFR ( Figures 1A and 1B ) . The stimulation of Gal3 binding was observed with as little as 1 ng / mL of EGF in MDA - MB - 231 cells , illustrating the exquisite sensitivity of the system ( Figure S1A ) . This effect was 30 also found in HN12 tongue squamous cell carcinoma cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) ( Figures S1B and S1C ) . However , in NR6 mouse fibroblasts that lack EGFR ( Pruss and Herschman , 1977 ) , the EGF - stimulated Gal3 binding was only observed upon ectopic EGFR expression ( Figure S1D ) . Furthermore , the pretreatment of MDA - MB - 231 ( Figure 1C ) or HN12 ( Figure S1B ) cells with afatinib ( AFT ) , an irreversible EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor 35 ( Yu and Pao , 2013 ) , prevented the EGF - induced Gal3 binding . Next , we determined whether the EGFR - dependent stimulation of Gal3 binding occurred under physiological conditions . Based on the results in the tongue squamous cell carcinoma - derived HN12 cells ( Figure S1B ) , we chose the oral cavity and in particular the tongue epidermis ( Figure 1D ) , since it is exposed to high levels of EGF ( 1 µg / ml ) secreted into the 40 saliva in mice ( Byyny et al . , 1974 ) , and it shows high expression of EGFR in the basal layer ( Figure 1E ) . Notably , we found that AFT administration to live animals , and not the vehicle , inhibited EGFR autophosphorylation on tyrosine 1068 ( Figure S1E ) and significantly reduced the binding of Gal3 to the basal layer ( Figure 1F ) . Altogether , these findings demonstrate that EGFR and its tyrosine kinase activity are 45 required for EGF - induced Gal3 binding to cells in vitro and in the complex environment of a living organism . Gal3 binding is partly permissive to α 2 - 3 - linked Sia capping of glycans but blocked by α 2 - 6 - linked Sia ( Leffler and Barondes , 1986 ; Stowell et al . , 2008 ; Zhuo and Bellis , 2011 ) ( Figure 2A ) . We therefore tested whether the EGF - induced increase of Gal3 binding to cells was 50 4 dependent on the enzymatic removal of Sia ( desialylation ) . For this , we used the compound , 2 - deoxy - 2 - 3 - didehydro - N - acetylneuraminic acid ( DANA ) , which is a known inhibitor of endogenous neuraminidases ( Neu1 - 4 ) that desialylate glycans ( Glanz et al . , 2018 ) . Pretreatment of MDA - MB - 231 cells ( Figure 1C ) , HN12 cells ( Figure S1B ) or MEFs ( Figure S1C ) with DANA resulted in failure of EGF to induce Gal3 binding . This was not due to an 5 impairment in EGFR signaling under these conditions , as EGF - induced phosphorylation of extracellular signal - regulated kinases 1 / 2 ( ERK1 / 2 ) and ribosomal S6 kinases ( RSK ) was not affected by incubation of cells with DANA ( Figures S1G and S1H ) . Treatment with sialostatin ( STI , also called SiaFNEtoc ) , a general inhibitor of cellular sialylation ( Moons et al . , 2022 ) ( Figure 2A ) , augmented basal Gal3 binding and abolished the EGF - induced increase 10 ( Figures S1I and S1J ) . All these findings are consistent with the notion that the effect of EGF on Gal3 binding to plasma membrane proteins is directly dependent on the presence of Sia residues and their removal . To identify the cell surface glycoproteins that undergo EGF - induced desialylation , we 15 employed a multi - step lectin - enriched mass spectrometry - based approach . First , we demonstrated that binding of the α 2 - 6 Sia linkage - specific Sambucus nigra ( SNA ) lectin ( Figure 2A ) to MDA - MB - 231 cells was reduced after EGF treatment ( Figure S1K ) . Interestingly , EGF treatment did not measurably affect binding of the α 2 - 3 linkage - specific lectin - like Lectenz reagent ( Figure S1L ) , suggesting that predominantly α 2 - 6 Sia capped 20 glycans are being desialylated upon EGF stimulation to serve for efficient Gal3 binding . This is in agreement with the published notion that only α 2 - 6 - linked Sia blocks glycan recognition by Gal3 ( Leffler and Barondes , 1986 ; Stowell et al . , 2008 ; Zhuo and Bellis , 2011 ) ( Figure 2A ) . Second , we identified Gal3 interactors at the surface on MDA - MB - 231 cells ( green quadrant 25 in Figure 2B ) . Third , we used cell surface - bound SNA to identify α 2 - 6 sialylated plasma membrane proteins ( STI as a control for total sialylation ) , and then cross referenced these with the list of Gal3 interactors ( Figure 2C , Table S1 ) . We thereby identified 93 proteins that were high confidence interactors of both , Gal3 and SNA ( yellow quadrant in Figure 2C , Table S1 ) . 30 of these 93 high confidence interactors were significantly desialylated upon 30 EGF treatment ( green quadrant in Figure 2D , Table S2 ) . Gene ontology analysis on these 30 hits revealed cell adhesion , migration , and locomotion as some of the most highly enriched terms ( Figure 2E ) . To further validate the proteomics data we focused amongst the 30 hits on the cell adhesion and migration factor α 3 β 1 integrin , as integrins undergo extensive endocytic trafficking 35 ( Jones et al . , 2006 ; Moreno - Layseca et al . , 2019 ) and have been identified as substrates for both , Gal3 - driven internalization ( Furtak et al . , 2001 ; Lakshminarayan et al . , 2014 ) and retrograde transport in relation to persistent cell migration ( Shafaq - Zadah et al . , 2016 ) . Pulldown and Western blotting experiments confirmed that the α 3 chain was indeed desialylated upon EGF treatment of MDA - MB - 231 cells ( Figures 2F and 2G ) . 40 Therefore , we established that EGF acutely triggers desialylation of select plasma membrane proteins including those involved in cell adhesion and migration . EGF - induced desialylation requires Neu1 and Neu3 and is abrogated in NEU1 deficient patients . To elucidate the mechanism underlying the EGFR - induced desialylation , we first employed a 45 siRNA - based screen for the four endogenous desialylation enzymes Neu1 - 4 ( Monti et al . , 2010 ) . Knockdown of Neu1 and Neu3 , previously reported to be localized to the plasma membrane ( Maurice et al . , 2016 ; Monti et al . , 2000 ; Monti et al . , 1999 ; Seyrantepe et al . , 2004 ; Zanchetti et al . , 2007 ) , led to a loss of EGF - induced Gal3 binding to the cell surface ( Figure S2A ) . We confirmed these results using a CRISPR - based knockout approach in 50 MDA - MB - 231 cells ( Figures 3A , S2B and S2C ) . Importantly , autophosphorylation of EGFR 5 was not affected in NEU1 and NEU3 knockout cell lines ( Figure S2D ) , suggesting that neuraminidase activity is required for Gal3 binding downstream of EGFR signaling . Deficiency in NEU1 is found in the rare lysosomal storage disease type 1 sialidosis ( Bonten et al . , 1996 ; Sphranger et al . , 1977 ) . We found here that NEU1 deficiency abolished EGF - induced Gal3 binding to patient - derived fibroblasts , while fibroblasts from healthy donors 5 showed the expected increase of Gal3 binding ( Figure 3B ) . We further tested fibroblasts from donors with genetic deficiencies in the upstream biosynthetic pathway leading to Sia capped N - glycans , including the MGAT2 and B4GALT1 enzymes ( Figure 3C ) . These cells also did not show enhanced Gal3 binding after EGF stimulation ( Figure 3B ) . While the glycosylation of β 1 integrin was altered in MGAT2 or B4GALT1 - deficient cells ( Figure S2E ) , 10 the EGFR - dependent MAPK signaling remained intact in all the tested deficiency conditions ( Figure S2F ) , further supporting that loss of EGF - induced Gal3 binding on mutant cells was not due to a general perturbation of EGFR signaling . These findings provide strong genetic evidence for the link between EGFR signaling and Neu1 / 3 - mediated desialylation of plasma membrane proteins leading to increased Gal3 15 binding . Acidification - based mechanism for desialylation at the plasma membrane We next set out to identify the signaling pathway linking EGFR and Neu1 / 3 . While it has been reported that Neu1 can be phosphorylated downstream of growth factor receptors in lymphocytes ( Lukong et al . , 2001 ) , we failed to detect EGF - induced changes in the 20 phosphorylation status of Neu1 or Neu3 in MDA - MB - 231 cells . These enzymes , which exhibit a limited activity at the pH of the extracellular medium ( pH 7 . 4 ) , work optimally at around pH 5 . 5 ( Albohy et al . , 2010 ) . Therefore , we hypothesized the existence of a mechanism of transient acidification at the plasma membrane . As the hydroxide is the fastest agent to buffer protons , we tested if step wise incubation of MDA - MB - 231 cells in an 25 alkaline buffer ( incubation with EGF at pH 8 . 4 , followed by incubation with Gal3 at neutral pH ) affected the EGF - induced Gal3 binding , and remarkably found that high pH abrogated the EGF effect ( Figure 3D ) . In this condition , EGFR activation still occurred , as shown by the fact that EGF - induced autophosphorylation of EGFR on tyrosine 1068 was not affected ( Figure 3E ) , as previously reported ( Nunez et al . , 1993 ) . Furthermore , the abrogation of Gal3 30 binding at alkaline pH was fully reversible by restoring physiological pH ( Figure 3D , pH rescue ) . Finally , incubating cells in pH 5 . 5 buffer without EGF induced a similar increase in Gal3 binding as with incubation with EGF ( Figure 3F ) . Of note , this pH 5 . 5 - triggered effect on Gal3 binding was strictly dependent on sialidase activity as it was abolished in the presence of DANA ( Figure 3F ) . 35 These findings demonstrate that extracellular acidification is necessary and sufficient for triggering Neu1 / 3 - mediated Gal3 binding to cells . A clue as to how the extracellular pH might be controlled came from studies in which it was shown that EGFR induces the acidification of the extracellular milieu through the activation of the NHE1 channel , a Na + / H + antiporter whose activity is correlated with tumor malignancy 40 ( Fliegel , 2021 ; Koivusalo et al . , 2010 ; Sardet et al . , 1990 ; Stock and Pedersen , 2017 ) . We found that NHE1 was required for EGF - induced Gal3 binding , using MDA - MB - 468 breast cancer cells with NHE1 knockout and re - expression rescue ( Figure 3G ) . Notably , pH 5 . 5 incubation stimulated Gal3 binding even on NHE1 knockout cells ( Figure 3H ) , thus positioning the acidification of the extracellular medium downstream of NHE1 ( Figure 3H ) 45 and upstream of Neu1 / 3 ( DANA in Figure 3F ) . EGFR was also reported to stimulate NHE1 activity by phosphorylation at position S703 , through signaling mediated by RAF - MEK - ERK and p90RSK kinases , and at positions S766 , S770 , and S771 , by ERK1 / 2 ( Takahashi et al . , 1999 ) . We found that a triple mutation in the NHE1 gene ( S766A , S770A , S771A ; termed SSSA ) rescued the EGF - induced Gal3 binding in MDA - MB - 231 cells lacking NHE1 , whereas 50 6 a mutation at position S703 ( S703A ) did not ( Figure S2G ) . This identifies phosphorylation of NHE1 at S703 as a critical event for EGFR signaling leading to increased Gal3 binding . Pharmacological inhibition of NHE1 using cariporide ( CAR ) ( Scholz et al . , 1993 ) also led to the loss of the EGF effect on Gal3 binding ( Figures 3I and S2H ) . The involvement of the MAP kinase pathway was confirmed by pharmacological interference with MEK activity 5 using the inhibitor PD98059 ( Figures 3I and S2H ) . In contrast , the phosphoinositide 3 - kinase inhibitor PI - 103 had no effect on EGF - induced Gal3 binding ( Figure 3I ) , indicating that the PI3K / Akt pathway is not involved . NHE1 thereby is a key mediator between EGFR signaling and extracellular acidification leading to Neu1 / 3 - catalyzed desialylation of cargo proteins and subsequent Gal3 binding . 10 Collectively , these results identify a pathway that is triggered by the activation of EGFR signaling and involves the sequential downstream activation of 1 ) the sodium – proton antiporter NHE1 , which induces a transient acidification , 2 ) the neuraminidases Neu1 and Neu3 which catalyze desialylation of plasma membrane glycoproteins , and 3 ) Gal3 binding to these glycoproteins . 15 EGF - induced desialylation triggers endocytosis Since Gal3 is a key driver of clathrin - independent endocytic uptake according to the GL - Lect mechanism , we tested whether EGF - induced desialylation modulated α 3 β 1 integrin endocytosis in a Gal3 - dependent manner . When MDA - MB - 231 cells were treated with EGF , the uptake of a fluorescently labeled anti - α 3 integrin antibody was significantly increased , 20 whereas the internalization of transferrin , a classic clathrin pathway cargo , was not affected ( Figures 4A and 4B ) . The EGF - induced stimulation of α 3 integrin uptake was lost when incubations were made in the presence of the membrane impermeable Gal3 - specific inhibitor 3 ( termed I3 in the current study ; GB0149 - 03 in ( Salameh et al . , 2010 ; Stegmayr et al . , 2019 ) ) ( Figure 4B ) , which established that the extracellular fraction of Gal3 was required 25 for this effect . EGF also induced the uptake of β 1 integrin ( Figures 4C , S2I and S2J ) and of the G protein coupled receptor CD97 ( Figure 4D and 4E ) , which was also present in the list of cargoes that are desialylated upon incubation with EGF ( Figure 2D ) . For both cargoes , this EGF - induced uptake occurred in a neuraminidase - dependent manner ( Figures 4C and 4E ) . Furthermore , interference with EGFR tyrosine kinase activity , NHE1 , and RSK kinase 30 ( BI - D1870 ) resulted in a loss of EGF - stimulated endocytosis of β 1 integrin ( Figure 4F ) . This highlights that the signal transmission chain between EGFR and cargo protein desialylation is involved in the stimulatory effect of EGF on Gal3 - dependent α 3 β 1 integrin and CD97 uptake . Of note , TNF α , which is amongst the growth factors that trigger Gal3 binding to cells ( Figure 1B ) , also stimulated β 1 integrin uptake in a sialidase - sensitive manner ( Figure 4C ) , 35 which suggests that the described desialylation mechanism may apply in signaling contexts other than EGF . To directly test whether an EGF - induced transient decrease of the extracellular pH occurred in the immediate vicinity of endocytic events , anti - α 3 integrin antibodies were coupled to the pH - sensitive dye AcidiFluor Orange , which is non - fluorescent at neutral pH and becomes 40 fluorescent upon acidification . Using a microscopy setup that allows switching within seconds between total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) and widefield acquisitions ( Figures 4G and 4H ) , we recorded the pH surrounding α 3 integrin from locations at or near the plasma membrane to deeply internalized endocytic carriers . We found that low pH signal was first observed in the plasma membrane - proximal zone by TIRF microscopy ( Figure 4I , 45 red ) , upon which internalization into the full volume of cells was tracked by widefield microscopy ( green ) . The incubation of cells with EGF increased the number ( Figure 4J ) and peak intensities ( Figure 4K ) of these events . Analysis of endocytic events by lattice light sheet microscopy ( LLSM ) ( Figures S2K and S2L ) was consistent with the conclusions that the increased fluorescence signal of AcidiFluor Orange - tagged anti - α 3 integrin antibody 50 resulted from EGF - induced acidification in the immediate environment of the cargo to which 7 it was bound , and not from increased amounts of cargo . This EGF effect was lost in the presence of cariporide , which again strongly argued for the involvement of NHE1 in the observed acidification process ( Figures 4J and 4K ) . Ultrastructural studies revealed very few small ( 80 - 120 nm ) or large ( > 120 nm ) vesicular carriers containing α 3 or β 1 integrin ( Figures 5A , S3A and S3B ) . In contrast , both proteins 5 were abundantly found in short tubular and crescent shaped structures , a morphological hallmark of clathrin - independent endocytic carriers ( CLICs ) ( Howes et al . , 2010 ; Lakshminarayan et al . , 2014 ) . Quantification revealed an increase of β 1 integrin - positive CLICs upon incubation of cells with EGF ( Figure 5B ) . To dynamically map endocytic uptake events for β 1 integrin , we employed LLSM on gene 10 edited triple negative SUM159 breast cancer cells expressing AP2 - eGFP ( Aguet et al . , 2016 ) , a key adaptor of the clathrin pathway ( Kural et al . , 2015 ) . LLSM allowed for 3D imaging of live cells at high acquisition frequency ( Figures 5C , 5D and 5E and Movies S1 - 4 ) . Using advanced image - processing techniques ( Renard et al . , 2020 ) , we detected and tracked diffraction - limited β 1 integrin spots , and extracted data from single endocytic events 15 per cell , including distance from the plasma membrane and fluorescence intensity of β 1 integrin and AP2 - eGFP ( Figures 5F , 5G and 5H ) . To define whether β 1 integrin was endocytosed together with clathrin , we measured whether tracks were positive or negative for AP2 ( Figures 5D and 5E , Movie S5 ) . While a minority of transferrin endocytic tracks were AP2 - negative , β 1 integrin endocytic tracks were equally distributed between AP2 - negative 20 and positive categories ( Figures 5F and 5G ) . Only for β 1 integrin the addition of EGF resulted in significant increase of AP2 - negative events ( Figures 5F and 5G ) . These findings confirm that EGF selectively augments non - clathrin mediated endocytosis of β 1 integrin . Collectively , we conclude that EGF ( and TNF α ) - induced desialylation triggers Gal3 binding and clathrin - independent GL - Lect driven endocytosis of α 3 β 1 integrin . 25 EGF - induced desialylation is reversible We previously hypothesized a link between GL - Lect driven endocytosis and retrograde trafficking to the Golgi apparatus where the glycosylation machinery including sialyltransferases is localized ( Shafaq - Zadah et al . , 2020 ) . Using a HeLa cell line engineered for capture of retrograde cargoes ( Johannes and Shafaq - Zadah , 2013 ) ( Figure 6A ) , we 30 observed that Gal3 itself is transported from the plasma membrane to the Golgi apparatus , and that this process was stimulated by incubation with EGF ( Figure 6B ) . To gain a general view on the link between Gal3 , EGF and retrograde transport , Gal3 binders at the plasma membrane were pulled down from EGF - treated or untreated Golgi SNAP - tag expressing HeLa cells and analyzed by quantitative mass spectrometry ( Figure 35 6C ) . Of the Gal3 interactors that were present in either condition ( blue quadrants from Figure 6C ) , 26 were significantly enriched after EGF stimulation ( red quadrant in Figure 6D ) in addition to 235 unique proteins ( Table S3 ) . Gene ontology revealed cell adhesion , migration and locomotion as some of the most highly enriched terms ( Figure S3C ) , similarly to what was shown in Figure 2E for MDA - MB - 231 cells . We then determined the retrograde 40 proteome in these cells ( Figure 6E ) and used this to identify the EGF - stimulated Gal3 interactors , i . e . , client proteins , that underwent retrograde transport to the Golgi ( yellow quadrant in Figure 6F ) . Notably , α 3 β 1 integrin , CD97 and a known Gal3 cargo , CD44 ( Lakshminarayan et al . , 2014 ) , were amongst the hits ( Tables S4 and S5 ) . Using the antibody uptake protocol ( Figure 6A ) , we confirmed that retrograde trafficking of the β 1 and 45 α 3 integrin chains was indeed stimulated by EGF ( Figures 6G and S3D ) . We next tested if proteins acutely desialylated at the cell surface by EGF treatment undergo resialylation intracellularly . As shown above ( Figures 2F and 2G ) , EGF treatment on ice led to a 36 % reduction of α 2 - 6 - linked Sia modifications on α 3 integrin . After 1 h of chase at 37 °C , during which receptor - bound EGF continues to signal , the reduction of α 2 - 6 50 sialylation was as high as 72 % ( Figures 6H and 6I , 1 h lane ) . Strikingly , after 6 h of chase at 8 37 °C , the α 2 - 6 sialylation of α 3 integrin returned to pre - EGF treatment levels ( Figures 6H and 6I , 6 h lane ) . Since this recovery was also observed when cells were chased in the presence of the protein biosynthesis inhibitor cycloheximide ( Figure 6H and 6I , 6 h lane + CHX ) , we concluded that sialylation did not originate from newly synthesized α 3 integrin . Our data demonstrate the existence of an EGF - controlled reversible Sia glycan - based 5 regulatory circuit , which through the EGF - induced desialylation and Gal3 - dependent retrograde trafficking of plasma membrane glycoproteins provides access to the Golgi apparatus to reset their sialylation state . The stimulation of cell migration by EGF depends on desialylation Endocytic trafficking is critical for complex cellular properties such as cell polarity and 10 migration ( Moreno - Layseca et al . , 2019 ; Shafaq - Zadah et al . , 2020 ; Sigismund et al . , 2021 ) . We previously reported that retrograde transport of β 1 integrin from the cell surface to the Golgi apparatus is required for its polarized re - localization to the leading edge of migrating cells and thereby , for persistent cell migration ( Shafaq - Zadah et al . , 2016 ) . Given that EGF is known to stimulate cell migration ( Blay and Brown , 1985 ) , we investigated whether this 15 effect was dependent on the discovered regulatory de / resialylation circuit . First , we studied the migration of MDA - MB - 231 cells in cell - derived matrices ( Kaukonen et al . , 2017 ) obtained from telomerase immortalized fibroblasts . Velocity , accumulated distance , and notably Euclidean distance were increased by EGF ( Figures 7A , 7B , S3E and S3F ) . Strikingly , this stimulatory effect of EGF was consistently abrogated in the presence of 20 the Gal3 inhibitor I3 ( Figures 7A , 7B , S3E and S3F ) , and by genetic or pharmacological interference with the EGFR tyrosine kinase , MEK , NHE1 , Neu1 and Neu3 activities ( Figures 7C , S3G and S3H ) . Second , we measured the migration of MDA - MB - 231 cells using an inverted invasion assay , where cells migrate through a 3D environment made from rat tail collagen supplemented 25 with fibronectin , and in which EGF is used as a chemoattractant ( Hennigan et al . , 1994 ) . As expected , the EGFR inhibitor afatinib ( AFT ) reduced cell migration to the level observed in the absence of EGF ( Figures 7D and 7E ) . The same reduction in cell migration was found when NEU1 and / or NEU3 were genetically eliminated ( Figures 7D and 7F ) , when general sialidase activity was inhibited with DANA , or Gal3 function with I3 ( Figure 7E ) . Migration 30 may have relied on α 3 β 1 integrin which , despite being a major receptor for laminins , has also been reported to function with collagens and fibronectin ( Chen et al . , 2022 ; Elices et al . , 1991 ) . Alternatively , other α chains showed a similar response to EGF treatment as α 3 integrin ( Figure 2D ) , such as α 2 integrin , a major collagen receptor ( Staatz et al . , 1990 ) . The stimulatory effect of EGF on cell migration clearly depends on all the outlined 35 components of the EGF - induced de / resialylation circuit that we have discovered . D ISCUSSION Based on our findings , we propose the existence of a regulatory process - termed desialylation glycoswitch - in which EGF triggers the immediate desialylation of glycans on select surface glycoproteins and their rapid internalization and retrograde transport to the 40 Golgi apparatus ( Figure 7G ) for redesign of the glycan makeup and repurposing to accommodate new functions such as the dynamic and polarized localization to specialized areas of the plasma membrane . The desialylation glycoswitch represents a novel concept that challenges the perceived notion of the glycan makeup of plasma membrane proteins being static . Since most plasma membrane glycoproteins carry Sia capped glycans 45 ( Schjoldager et al . , 2020 ; Varki , 2016 ) , this mechanism has the potential to shape a vast array of biological functions in virtually all tissues . In the current study , we focused on cell adhesion molecules , integrins , and their retrograde transport - dependent polarized localization to the leading edge of migratory cells ( Shafaq - 9 Zadah et al . , 2016 ) , which we show to be required for EGF - induced persistent cell migration . This signaling - induced dynamic localization to specialized areas of the plasma membrane may also operate in other cell types ( Shafaq - Zadah et al . , 2020 ) , such as in activated T lymphocytes for the construction of immunological synapses ( Carpier et al . , 2018 ) . Furthermore , we focused on EGFR as an inducer of desialylation in relation to Gal3 - driven 5 endocytic uptake , which revealed a novel facet of EGFR signaling . Other growth factors ( e . g . , TNF α ) , and other desialylation triggers may also operate the desialylation glycoswitch mechanism , such as depolarization in synaptic nerve terminals ( Boll et al . , 2020 ) and acute stress ( Abe et al . , 2019 ) . The latter may function through α - adrenergic stimulation - induced increase of EGF levels in serum , which can become as high as 150 ng / mL ( Byyny et al . , 10 1974 ; Cohen and Elliott , 1963 ) . Acidification of the extracellular milieux , as seen in cancer ( Amith and Fliegel , 2013 ) , may also sensitize tumor tissue for desialylation glycoswitch - mediated effects through the NHE1 - dependent pH trigging mechanism that we uncovered in our study . It is furthermore notable that the maturation of neurons leads to an increase in Sia content ( Govind et al . , 2021 ) . 15 EGF levels are found in the range of dozens to hundreds of ng / mL in body fluids such as saliva and urine ( Byyny et al . , 1974 ; Sigismund et al . , 2005 ) ( see Supplemental Materials for more details ) . Our finding that Gal3 binding to basal cells of the saliva - exposed tongue is decreased upon EGFR inhibition in living mice indicates that the desialylation glycoswitch may indeed operate in vivo in this tissue . A strong human genome - wide association study 20 ( GWAS ) signal for estimated glomerular filtration rate traits are found in the identified desialylation glycoswitch component Neu1 ( Wuttke et al . , 2019 ) , suggesting an involvement in protein resorption from urine by proximal tubule epithelial cells . Of note , the reduced Gal3 binding to cells from patients with genetically determined glycosylation disorders ( Willems et al . , 2016 ) in which N - glycan maturation or remodeling is deficient , including NEU1 in type 1 25 sialidosis ( Bonten et al . , 1996 ; Sphranger et al . , 1977 ) , indicates that the desialylation glycoswitch mechanism may be disrupted , in part explaining reported clinical symptoms such as proteinuria and protuberant tongue ( Ranganath et al . , 2012 ) . In vivo effects of glycan changes associated with NEU1 may also be molecularly interpreted by other galectins , with overlapping and distinct specificities and functions ( Johannes et al . , 2018 ; 30 Leffler and Barondes , 1986 ; Stowell et al . , 2008 ; Tribulatti et al . , 2012 ) . Gal3 knockout mice have some distinct phenotypic deficiencies , but only mild effects in other cellular functions ( Cao et al . , 2002 ; Colnot et al . , 1998 ; Hsu et al . , 2000 ) . This may be due to compensatory action by other galectins , or other mechanisms . The EGF - induced trafficking cycle is poised for the repurposing of plasma membrane 35 glycoproteins by changing their glycan makeup . Sialylation itself is an obvious candidate . A critical step is regulating the linkage ( α 2 - 3 or α 2 - 6 ) of Sia capping of glycoproteins , as this has major consequences for recognition of glycan - binding proteins , such as the 15 members of the galectin family ( Leffler and Barondes , 1986 ; Stowell et al . , 2008 ; Zhuo and Bellis , 2011 ) ( Gal3 in the current study ) , or Sia - binding immunoglobulin - type lectins ( Siglecs ) with 40 their effects on inflammation and immune checkpoints ( Läubli and Varki , 2020 ; Varki and Gagneux , 2012 ) . We envision that Sia linkages can be tuned in function of pathophysiological situations following growth factor - induced desialylation at the plasma membrane and subsequent resialylation in the Golgi apparatus . Whether other types of glycosylation can also be edited through this cycle remains to be explored . 45 In conclusion , our desialylation glycoswitch concept elevates glycosylation to the level of dynamic regulatory processes . In separate study , we propose another mechanism , termed the conformational glycoswitch , by which the spatial rearrangement of N - glycans during conformational transitions of membrane glycoproteins triggers Gal3 oligomerization leading to GL - Lect driven endocytosis ( Shafaq - Zadah et al . , submitted ) . While the mechanistic 50 wiring is different with covalent glycan modifications in the case of the desialylation glycoswitch and spatial glycan remodeling in the case of the conformational glycoswitch , both mechanisms are complementary and have in common the acutely triggered binding of 10 galectins to glycans to drive endocytosis . Our findings of these glycoswitches , call for the reinterpretation of a plethora of biological interactions guided by glycans , for which dysregulation is causally linked to common human pathologies ( Smith and Bertozzi , 2021 ; Stowell et al . , 2015 ; Willems et al . , 2016 ) .

Human fibroblast cultures from patients with genetic glycosylation defects were collected as part of clinical care . Residual , de - identified material was used in this study under ethics agreements 10 from the Radboud University Medical Center , the Netherlands ( 2020 - 6588 ) . The fibroblasts were cultured in M199 media ( Sigma M2154 ) , supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) , 1 mM sodium pyruvate , 2 mM glutamine and penicillin / streptomycin ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . All cell lines were regularly tested for mycoplasma contamination . 15 Growth factors Human growth factors were purchased from Miltenyi Biotech : EGF ( 130 - 097 - 751 ) , FGF - 1 ( 130 - 095 - 790 ) , FGF - 2 ( 130 - 104 - 918 ) , PDGF - BB ( 130 - 108 - 163 ) , TNF - alpha ( 130 - 094 - 015 ) , VEGF ( 130 - 109 - 395 ) , and from Novus Biologicals : human TGF - alpha ( NBP2 - 3643 ) . Unless stated otherwise , EGF was used at the saturating concentrations of 100 ng / mL in the 20 experiments of this study to achieve maximal robustness throughout the multitude of experimental approaches that were used .

These 15 proteins were then plotted on a Volcano plot for Gal3 + EGF vs Gal3 pulldowns , and a list of EGF sensitive Gal3 interactors was thereby generated for proteins that had two - fold enrichment and p value < 0 . 05 . For the cross - reference of the retrograde proteome and Gal3 interactors , we plotted benzylguanine vs CTRL and Gal3 + EGF vs Gal3 on a correlative plot . Proteins that were common to both data sets were highlighted . All lists were generated using 20 myProMS . Gene ontology ( GO ) analysis . GO functional enrichment analysis was performed using myProMS by using the complete ontology file and the subsequent list of “biological processes” terms were summarized using Revigo software using SimRel Cluster analysis methodology ( Supek et al . , 2011 ) , the resulting graphs were generated using R . For each 25 data point the size of the spot equals - LOG2 p - value for each GO term , spot color equals - LOG10 number of annotations that have been summarized under each category . The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited for all pulldowns and subsequent MS raw datasets to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository ( Perez - Riverol et al . , 2022 ) with the dataset identifier PXD041450 .

Resialylation assay MDA - MB - 231 cells were incubated for 1 h on ice in the presence or absence of 100 ng / mL 35 EGF , after which cells were incubated at 37 ºC in full media + / - cyclohexamide ( 100 µg / ml ) , and lysed at the indicated timepoints in 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 , 0 . 5 % NP - 40 in PBS buffer containing EDTA free protease inhibitors . 750 µg of lysate , determined by BCA assay , was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C under rotation with 5 µg / mL SNA - biotin and M280 - Strepavdin - dynabeads . Beads were washed 3 times in 1 % NP - 40 / PBS and resuspended in sample 40 buffer . Samples and 1 % of input were run on 7 . 5 % Tris - Glycine precast gels ( Biorad ) and processed for Western blotting . Immunoprecipitation of (cid:0) 3 integrin MDA - MB - 231 cells were serum starved for 1 h at 37 °C , incubated for 1 h on ice with 1 45 µg / mL of anti - (cid:0) 3 integrin ( ASC - 1 ) in 0 . 2 % fatty acid free BSA / DMEM , washed 3 times in PBS , incubated for 1 h on ice in the presence of absence of 100 ng / mL EGF washed 3 times with PBS , and lysed in 2 . 5 % Elugent , 300 mM NaCl . 400 µg of lysate , determined by BCA assay , were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with protein A / G beads , which were washed 3 times in lysis buffer . Samples were analyzed on stain - free gels , then submitted to Western blotting 50 and probed with SNA - biotin , according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Genome editing MDA - MB - 231 CRISPR KO cell lines for Neu1 or Neu3 were generated following the published protocol for genome editing using the Indel Detection by Amplicon Analysis ( IDAA ) 55 22 ( Lonowski et al . , 2017 ) . MDA - MB - 231 cells were co - transfected with the specific gRNA pU6 - plasmid ( Table S6 ) and the Cas9 - GFP pBKS vector ( # 68371 , Addgene ) using Ingenio electroporation solution ( Mirus ) . 24 h after transfection , cells were FACS sorted into 96 - well plates for GFP expressing cells . 96 - wells were duplicated . One set was used for IDAA analysis and subsequent sequencing to validate the knockout . The second set was used for 5 generating a permanent knockout cell line stock and tested for mycoplasma contamination . Migration on cell - derived matrices Cell - derived matrices were generated according to the method developed by the Yamada team ( Cukierman et al . , 2001 ) . Briefly , 6 / 12 - well plastic plates ( Corning ) were coated with 10 0 . 2 % gelatin ( v / v , Sigma Aldrich ) , crosslinked with 1 % glutaraldehyde ( v / v , Sigma Aldrich ) and quenched with 1 M glycine ( Thermo Fisher ) before telomerase immortalised fibroblasts ( TIFs ) were confluently seeded . DMEM medium supplemented with 0 . 25 % ascorbic acid ( v / v , Sigma Aldrich ) was changed every 48 h for 8 days . Cells were denuded with extraction buffer ( 20 mM ammonium hydroxide ( NH 4 OH ) ; 0 . 5 % ( v / v ) Triton X - 100 ) to leave only matrix . 15 Finally , DNAse was used for cleavage of phosphodiester linkages in the DNA backbone . Wildtype , Neu1 , or Neu3 knockout MDA - MB - 231 cells were then seeded sparsely in these cell - derived matrices , left to spread for 4 h at 37 °C , pretreated or not as indicated with I3 / afatinib ( AFT ) / cariporide ( CAR ) / PD98059 / DANA / DMSO vehicle control for 1 h and with EGF for 15 min at 37 °C prior to imaging cell migration . Cells were incubated at 5 % CO 2 for 20 16 h at 37 °C in DMEM with 1 % FCS , and recorded using an Eclipse Ti inverted microscope ( Nikon ) with a 20x / 0 . 45 SPlan Fluor objective and the Nikon filter sets for brightfield and a pE - 300 LED ( CoolLED ) fluorescent light source with imaging software NIS Elements AR . 46 . 00 . 0 . Images were acquired using a Retiga R6 ( Q - Imaging ) camera . 6 randomly chosen positions per well were captured every 10 min . Individual cells were tracked using 25 Manual tracking software ( ImageJ ) and Chemotaxis tool set ( ImageJ ) . Inverted invasion assay Inverted invasion assays were performed based on the protocol as described previously ( Hennigan et al . , 1994 ) . Collagen I ( rat - tail ; final concentration 1 . 5 mg / mL ; Gibco ) 30 supplemented with 25 μ g / mL fibronectin was allowed to polymerize in inserts ( Transwell ; Corning ) for 5 min at room temperature then a further 30 min at 37 °C . Transwells were inverted for wildtype MDA - MB - 231 cells to be seeded directly onto the underside at a concentration of 5 x 10 5 cells / mL and left for 4 h at 37 °C . Transwells were then re - inverted and placed in serum - free medium in the presence or absence of I3 , afatinib ( AFT ) , DANA or 35 DMSO vehicle control , as indicated . Medium supplemented with 10 % FCS and 100 ng / mL EGF , and the aforementioned inhibitors ( or DMSO as control ) was placed on top of the matrix , thereby providing a chemotactic gradient for invasion . After 72 h at 37 °C , all cells were stained 1 h at 37 °C with calcein - AM prior to imaging by confocal microscopy with an inverted Leica SP8 microscope using a 20× objective . Cells were considered invasive 40 beyond 45 µm ( red line marked in Fig 5H ) , and optical slices were imaged at 15 µm intervals . Invasion was quantified using the area calculator plugin in ImageJ , where the invasive proportion was obtained by measuring the fluorescence intensity of cells invading > 45 μ m divided by the total fluorescence intensity in all Z - stack images . 45 Electron microscopy MDA - MB - 231 cells were grown to 40 % confluency in 40 mm dishes . The next day , cells were incubated for 1 h , at 37 °C in serum - free medium , then for 6 min at 37 °C with serum - free medium containing 10 µg / mL of Gal3 - HRP , anti - β 1 integrin antibody ( K20 ) - HRP or anti - (cid:0) 3 integrin antibody ( ASC - 1 ) - HRP in the presence or absence of 100 ng / mL EGF . Cells 50 were put on ice and washed once with ice cold DMEM , 15 mM HEPES pH 7 . 3 , 1 % BSA , then twice with ice cold DMEM , 15 mM HEPES pH 7 . 3 . Cells were incubated protected from light for 10 min on ice in freshly prepared 0 . 7 (cid:5) mg / mL 3 , 3 ' - diaminobenzidine ( DAB ) solution ( Cat . no . D4293 , Sigma ) in DMEM , 15 mM HEPES pH 7 . 3 , 1 % BSA , followed by incubation for 20 min on ice with DAB , 30 % H 2 O 2 in the presence or absence of 10 mg / mL ascorbic 55 23 acid ( Cat . no . A0278 , Sigma ) , always protected from light . Cells were washed three times for 10 (cid:5) min each on ice with DMEM , 15 mM HEPES pH 7 . 3 , then fixed overnight at 4 °C in 2 . 5 % glutaraldehyde ( Cat . no . 16220 , Electron Microscopy Sciences , Pennsylvania , USA ) in 0 . 1 (cid:5) M Na - cacodylate ( pH 7 . 2 , Cat . no . 11653 ) . The following day , cells were washed three times with 0 . 1 M Na - cacodylate for 10 min each , then post - fixed for 1 h at room temperature 5 with 1 % osmium tetroxide ( OsO 4 ) ( Cat . no . 19152 , Electron Microscopy Sciences ) in 0 . 1 (cid:5) M Na - cacodylate , followed by one wash with 0 . 1 (cid:5) M Na - cacodylate for 10 min , and two washes with diH 2 O for 10 min each . Cells were then incubated with 4 % UA for 45 min at room temperature , and rinsed three times with diH 2 O for 10 min each . Tissue dehydration was performed at room temperature according to the following 10 incubation protocol : 50 % ethanol 5 (cid:5) min , 70 % ethanol 5 (cid:5) min , 90 % ethanol two times for 10 (cid:5) min each , 100 % ethanol three times for 10 (cid:5) min each , followed by infiltration of Epon resin LX112 ( Cat no . 21310 , Ladd Research Industries , Vermont USA ) at room temperature , 50 % resin ( LX112 / EtOH 100 % 1v / 1v ) for 30 (cid:5) min , then 100 % resin LX112 for 1 (cid:5) h . Cells were embedded in capsules containing LX112 for 2 - 3 days at 60 °C . Samples were 15 sectioned using an ultramicrotome ( Reichert Leica UCT ) , and sections of 65 (cid:5) nm thickness were deposited on formvar / carbon - coated grids ( form / carbon square 100 mesh – Cu : FCF100 - CU - SB Electron Microscopy Sciences ) . Sections were imaged using a Tecnai Spirit electron microscope ( FEI , Eindhoven , The Netherlands ) equipped with a 4K CCD camera ( EMSIS GmbH , Münster , Germany ) . 20 Quantification of electron micrographs A single slice was chosen for each cell , where the nucleus was clearly visible , roughly one quarter from the bottom of the cell . HRP - positive structures were counted and characterized as following : i ) Clathrin or caveolin - coated vesicles ( CCV ) , 80 - 120 nm in diameter with round 25 shapes ; ii ) clathrin - independent carriers ( CLIC ) , thin tubular structures of around 20 nm in diameter and up to 250 µm in length ; iii ) large vesicles or macropinosomes ( MP ) , round structures with diameters above 120 nm . All structures were counted in each slice . Lattice light sheet microscopy ( LLSM ) 30 Genome - edited SUM cells were plated 2 - 4 h before imaging on 5 mm diameter # 1 . 5 coverslips ( Cat . no . 72195 - 05 , Electron Microscopy Sciences ) . Cells were incubated for 2 min at 27 °C with 2 µg / mL anti - β 1 integrin - Cy3 antibody or with 1 µg / mL transferrin - Cy3 in the presence or absence of 100 ng / mL EGF in LLSM imaging media ( phenol red - free DMEM , high glucose , glutamax , supplemented with 1 % BSA , 0 . 01 % penicillin – streptomycin , 35 1 mM pyruvate , and 20 mM HEPES pH 7 . 3 ) . The coverslips were transferred to the LLSM coverslip holder and inserted into the imaging chamber containing LLSM imaging media ( for increased stability of the optical system ) . Imaging started within 5 - 8 min at 27 °C . LLSM was performed on a commercialized instrument of 3i ( Denver , USA ) , as previously described ( Chen et al . , 2014 ) . Cells were scanned incrementally through a 20 μ m long light sheet in 40 600 nm steps using a fast piezoelectric flexure stage equivalent to ∼ 325 nm with respect to the detection objective and were imaged using two sCMOS cameras ( Orca - Flash 4 . 0 ; Hamamatsu , Bridgewater , NJ ) . Excitation was achieved with 488 nm ( Sapphire Coherent ) or 560 nm diode lasers ( MPB Communications ) at 20 % acousto - optic tunable filter transmittance with 100 mW ( initial box power ) through an excitation objective ( Special Optics 45 28 . 6× 0 . 7 NA 3 . 74 mm water - dipping lens ) and detected via a Nikon CFI Apo LWD 25× 1 . 1 NA water - dipping objective with a 2 . 5× tube lens with a final pixel size of 104 nm . LLSM imaging was performed using an excitation pattern of outer NA equal to 0 . 55 and inner NA equal to 0 . 493 . Composite volumetric datasets were obtained using 10 ms exposure / slice / channel at a time resolution of 2 . 5 s per total cell volume ( 60 slices ) . Fifty 50 time points were acquired within 2 to 3 min . Acquired data sets were analyzed using an adapted version of cmeAnalysis3D software published previously ( Aguet et al . , 2016 ; Renard et al . , 2020 ) . The software package can be found as part of the Github repository of LLSM tools in https : / / github . com / francois - a / llsmtools / . cmeAnalysis3D was implemented in Matlab 2021b . Quantification of LLSM images was performed on raw images ( see 55 24 Quantitative analysis of lattice light - sheet images ) . Napari , a (cid:5) multi - dimensional image viewer for Python was used for 3D rendering ( doi : 10 . 5281 / zenodo . 3555620 ) . Quantitative analysis of Lattice light - sheet images Post - processing of raw data volumes was carried out as described previously ( Renard et al . , 5 2020 ) . Automated detection of AP2 structures or punctate structures of fluorescently - labeled cargoes in 3D was performed by numerical fitting with a model of the microscope point spread function ( PSF ) as described previously ( Aguet et al . , 2016 ) . Automated tracking of cargo and clathrin - adapter protein AP2 was calculated using the u - track software package ( Jaqaman et al . , 2008 ) , included in the cmeAnalysis3D software ( Aguet et al . , 2016 ) . We 10 used AP2 and cargo detection positions to map the membrane shape using the Matlab function of alphaShape ( Renard et al . , 2020 ) . Subsequently , we estimated the displacement of each cargo from the membrane position orthogonally inwards of the cell . The distinction between punctate structures diffusing on the membrane and internalized ones , whether by clathrin dependent ( AP2 - positive ) or clathrin independent ( AP2 - negative ) was made by 15 using the membrane position detection . An event was thereby counted as an endocytic event , if an object underwent a net displacement of at least 150 nm from the initial position inside the membrane proximal zone ( Renard et al . , 2020 ) . The membrane proximal zone was limited by the contour of the alphaShape and a line 400 nm inwards of the cell . To calculate the number of AP2 - positive and AP2 - negative events , for every qualified 20 internalization event of the cargo channel , the presence of AP2 was scored using the cmeAnalysis3D software ( Aguet et al . , 2016 ) . Only tracks with a duration longer than 8 sec were used for the analysis . Calculation of lifetime distributions and intensity cohorts were performed as described in detail previously ( Aguet et al . , 2016 ) . Quantification of LLSM images was performed on raw images . The raw LLSM images , used in Figures 5C - E and in 25 Supplemental Movies 1 - 5 were denoised using ND - SAFIR ( Boulanger et al . , 2010 ) , integrated into the BioImageIT platform ( Prigent et al . , 2022 ) before rendering in napari ( doi : 10 . 5281 / zenodo . 3555620 ) . Statistical analysis of Figure 5F was performed using Prism v9 . 4 . 1 software ( Graphpad Inc ) . 30 Animal procedures All experiments were approved by the National Cancer Institute ( National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , MD , USA ) Animal Care and Use Committee and were compliant with all relevant ethical regulations regarding animal research . Twelve wildtype C57BL / 6NCr mice were obtained from Charles Rivers Laboratory ( Frederick , MD , USA ) and divided in two 35 cohorts . For each cohort , 3 mice were treated with afatinib and 3 with DMSO ( vehicle ) . Briefly , stocks of 50 mg / mL afatinib ( Medchem express , Princeton , NJ , USA ) were dissolved in DMSO and stored at - 80 ˚C . Afatinib or an equivalent volume of DMSO ( control ) was delivered as a single dose by oral gavage in 0 . 5 % ( v / v ) methylcellulose and 0 . 2 % ( v / v ) Tween - 80 dissolved in deionized water . Six hours after the treatments , animals were 40 euthanized by CO 2 - inhalation followed by cervical dislocation . The tongues were excised , and 1 - 2 mm of the anterior portions were cut and flash frozen in vials containing Ck Mix - lysis beads ( Bertin Corp , Rockville , MD , USA ) . The remaining posterior parts of the tongues were covered with cryo - embedding media OCT ( Sakura Finetek , Torrance , CA , USA ) , snap frozen on powdered dry ice , and stored at −80 °C until sectioning . 45 Gal3 and EGFR staining : Within 48 h of embedding , 5 μ m coronal tongue sections were cut on a Leica CM1860 Cryostat ( Leica Biosystems , Buffalo Grove , IL , USA ) , mounted onto charged superfrost - plus glass slides ( Electron Microscopy Sciences , Hartfield , PA , USA ) and immediately processed for labeling with Gal3 . Sections were thawed at room temperature for 5 min , and OCT was removed by a brief 2 min wash in PBS . Sections were fixed for 10 min 50 in 4 % PFA in PBS followed by 3x 5 min washes in PBS . Sections were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in 5 % BSA followed by staining overnight at 4 ° C with CF594 - conjugated recombinant Gal3 ( 200 nM = 5 µg / mL ) or 1 : 100 anti - EGFR ( # D38B1 , Abcam ) in PBS containing 1 % BSA . The following day , sections were washed 2 times 5 min in PBS , incubated with 5 µg / mL DAPI for 10 min followed by two brief washes in PBS . Sections were 55 25 mounted in Fluoromount G ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) and imaged using a Leica SP8 confocal microscope ( Leica Biosystems , Buffalo Grove , IL , USA ) equipped with a 40x objective captured at a 512x512 pixel size with the following white light laser and filter settings : DAPI : λ ex = 405 nm , λ em = 416 - 441 nm ; Alexa Fluor 568 : λ ex = 575 nm , λ em = 585 - 663 nm ; Alexa Fluor 594 : λ ex = 594 nm , λ em = 604 - 637 nm ; Cy5 : λ ex = 650 nm , λ em = 5 660 - 795 nm . Image analysis : Two random areas of the epithelial layer were imaged for each tongue . Stacks of 40 optical sections ( 0 . 35 µm optical thickness ) were acquired and converted into maximal projections view using the ImageJ2 ( v2 . 9 . 0 / 1 . 53t ) sum - projection plug - in . The lectin fluorescence intensity of the basal layer was quantified by measuring the mean intensity in a 10 region of interest . Intensities were normalized for the mean intensity of vehicle - treated mice within each cohort . Normalized data from the two cohorts were pooled . Wilcoxon signed - rank test used for statistical analysis was conducted using R ( 4 . 2 . 1 , 2022 - 06 - 23 , R Core Team ) and R Studio ( 2022 . 07 . 0 , R Studio Team ) . Immunoblotting of mouse tongues : 400 µL RIPA buffer supplemented with 2x PhosSTOP 15 and 2x complete protease inhibitor ( Roche ) were added to the flash - frozen tongue biopsies and lysis was performed using a Precellys 24 tissue homogenizer with Ck mix beads ( Bertin Corp , Rockville , MD , USA ) ( 3 pulses , 6 . 500 x g for 30 s / pulse ) . Debris were removed by centrifugation at 4 ° C ( 21 . 000 x g for 10 min ) , supernatant isolated , and protein concentration quantified by DC protein assay ( Bio - Rad , Hercules , CA , USA ) . Samples were 20 diluted to 1 µg / µL in 1x Laemmli sample buffer ( Bio - Rad , Hercules , CA , USA ) . 40 µg of protein per sample were separated on a 4 - 20 % Criterion TGX gel ( Bio - rad , Hercules , CA , USA ) . Subsequently , proteins were blotted onto a 0 . 4 µm PVDF membrane ( EMD Milipore , Billerica , MA , USA ) in a wet transfer system ( 20 V , overnight at 4 ° C ) . Blots were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in 5 % BSA in TBS - T , followed by overnight incubation at 4 ° C in 25 primary antibodies : Anti - tubulin ( DMIA , 1 : 10 , 000 , Thermo Fischer Scientific , Pittsburg , PA , USA ) or anti - pEGFR ( D7A5 , 1 : 1 , 000 , Cell Signaling Technologies ) . The following day , blots were washed 3 times 5 min in TBS - T and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with secondary antibodies : HRP - conjugated anti - rabbit IgGs ( 1 : 2 , 000 , Cell Signaling Technologies ) or HRP - conjugated anti - mouse IgGs ( 1 : 2 , 000 , Bio - Rad , Hercules , CA , USA ) . 30 Blots were washed 3 times 5 min in TBS - T and developed with SuperSignal West Pico PLUS chemiluminescent substrate ( Thermo Scientific , Pittsburg , PA , USA ) according to manufacturer’s protocol . Developed blots were imaged on a chemidoc system ( Bio - Rad , Hercules , CA , USA ) . 35 26 S UPPLEMENTAL I NFORMATION T ITLES Figure S1 . EGF effect on Gal3 binding to cells Figure S2 .
