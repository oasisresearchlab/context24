© 2001 Macmillan Magazines Ltd NATURE REVIEWS | MOLECULAR CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 2 | NOVEMBER 2001 | 815 R E V I E W S To ensure that each daughter cell receives only one copy of each chromosome , exit from mitosis and cytokinesis must not occur before chromosome segregation has been completed . It is therefore crucial that mechanisms are in place that will establish a dependency of mitotic exit and cytokinesis on the completion of previous events . In the budding yeast Saccharomycescerevisiae , a signalling cas - cade known as the mitotic - exit network ( MEN ) controls exit from mitosis and ensures that this transition occurs only after sister - chromatid separation is initiated and the genetic material has been segregated between the mother and daughter cell . In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe , the septation - initiation network ( SIN ) functions later in the cell cycle , and ensures that cytokinesis occurs after chromosome segregation has been completed and when key promoters of mitosis — the mitotic cyclin - dependent kinases ( CDKs ) — are inactivated . In this review , we will discuss recent advances towards the determination of how the S . cerevisiae MEN and the S . pombe SIN pathways function and how they are regu - lated . We will first discuss the role of the MEN in control - ling cell - cycle regulation in budding yeast . We will then summarize what is known about the role of the SIN in controlling cell - cycle events in fission yeast . Finally , we will review what is known about the possible homolo - gous pathways in higher eukaryotes , as well as highlight - ing the similarity between the MEN and the SIN . Inactivation of mitotic CDKs in budding yeast In S . cerevisiae , entry into mitosis is promoted by mitotic CDKs . These comprise regulatory cyclin A or B subunits ( known as Clb cyclins in budding yeast ) , and a catalytic protein kinase subunit ( BOX 1 ) . During the early stages of mitosis , chromosomes condense and align at the metaphase plate . When all chromosomes have attached to the MITOTIC SPINDLE , chromosome segregation occurs ( anaphase ) . Chromosomes are first pulled towards the CENTROSOMES ( called spindle pole bodies in yeast ) and are then further separated as the mitotic spindle elongates . When chromosome segregation is complete , the cells exit from mitosis , which encompasses disassembly of the mitotic spindle and CHROMOSOME DECONDENSATION . For cells to exit from mitosis , the mitotic CDKs must be inactivated . Mitotic CDKs also need to be inactivated for cytokinesis — the final physical separation of two cells — to occur . If the inactivation of mitotic CDKs is prevented , cells will arrest in late anaphase / telophase , with DNA masses segregated and an extended mitotic spindle ( reviewed in REFS 1 , 2 ) . In all eukaryotes analysed to date , the inactivation of mitotic CDKs is initiated at the metaphase – anaphase transition , when chromosome segregation begins ( BOX 2 ; reviewed in REFS 3 – 5 ) . However , at least in budding yeast , the inactivation of mitotic CDKs is not completed at this transition , and a pool of active CDKs persists in the cell until SPINDLE ELONGATION has occurred 6 – 9 . The active pool of mitotic CDKs that is maintained beyond the metaphase – anaphase transition has an important bio - logical role , as mitotic CDK activity is required for the maintenance of the mitotic spindle 10 . Inactivation of mitotic CDKs is mediated by ubiqui - tin - dependent proteolysis of mitotic cyclins ( reviewed MEN AND SIN : WHAT’S THE DIFFERENCE ? Allison J . Bardin and Angelika Amon A conserved signalling cascade — termed the mitotic - exit network in budding yeast and the septation - initiation network in fission yeast — controls key events during exit from mitosis and cytokinesis .

The mechanism by which Cdc14 produces mitotic CDK inactivation is the reversal of mitotic CDK phosphorylation ( FIG . 1a ) 14 . For example , the CDK inhibitor Sic1is degraded throughout the cell cycle in a phosphorylation - dependent manner ( reviewed in REF . 11 ) , but is dephosphorylated by Cdc14 , which allows it to be stabilized 14 , 15 . Cdc14 also upregulates transcription of the SIC1 gene by dephosphorylating the transcription factor Swi5 , which promotes the transloca - tion of Swi5 into the nucleus 14 , 16 – 18 . Another substrate of Cdc14 is the APC specificity factor Cdh1 / Hct1 ( REFS 19 , 20 ) . Dephosphorylation of Cdh1 / Hct1 promotes its associa - tion with the APC / C , causing the APC / C to be activated ( FIG . 1a ) 2 , 14 , 15 . Presumably there are many Cdc14 substrates , but Cdc14 proves itself a crucial cell - cycle regulator of mitotic CDKs through its dephosphorylation of Sic1 , Swi5 and Cdh1 / Hct1 . in REFS 1 , 11 , 12 ) . A UBIQUITIN LIGASE , the anaphase - promot - ing complex or cyclosome ( APC / C ) , together with a specificity factor , ubiquitylates mitotic cyclins and tar - gets them for degradation by the 26S PROTEASOME ( BOX 2 ) . The specificity factor Cdc20 acts during the metaphase – anaphase transition to target mitotic cyclins as well as anaphase inhibitors for degradation . Later in the cell cycle , during exit from mitosis and G1 , the specificity factor Cdh1 / Hct1 works with the APC / C to target substrates for degradation . Cdc14 triggers mitotic CDK inactivation The pool of mitotic CDKs that persists beyond the metaphase – anaphase transition needs to be inactivated to allow exit from mitosis . APC / C - mediated degrada - tion of Clb cyclins leads to this inactivation , as does a CDK inhibitor called Sic1 ( reviewed in REFS 1 , 13 ) . The dual - specificity phosphatase Cdc14 is essential for the inactivation of mitotic CDKs 1 . Cells that carry a Box 1 | CDKs and their role in cell - cycle progression During G1 , the levels of G1 cyclins rise , and these cyclins associate with cyclin - dependent kinases ( CDKs ) . Activity of G1 CDKs promotes the passage of cells through START ( budding yeast ) , also known as the restriction point ( R ) in fission yeast and higher eukaryotes . After passing through this point , a cell is committed to continue through the cell cycle . In budding yeast , the G1 cyclins are Cln1 , Cln2 and Cln3 . Cln3 is present throughout the cell cycle at low levels , and this cyclin promotes the accumulation of Cln1 and Cln2 ( REF . 123 ) . In fission yeast , puc1 seems to be important — although not essential — for entry into the cell cycle 124 . In higher eukaryotes , cyclin D - associated kinases are thought to have a function similar to that of Cln3 – CDKs in budding yeast , and they are important for promoting the accumulation of the other G1 CDKs , cyclin E – CDKs 71 , 125 . S - phase CDKs begin to increase towards the end of G1 , and are inactivated during G2 and mitosis . On reaching a critical level , they promote DNA replication . In budding yeast , Clb5 and Clb6 - associated kinases are important for promoting DNA synthesis , but in their absence , mitotic CDKs ( Clb1 , Clb2 , Clb3 and Clb4 - associated kinases ) can support DNA replication . In S . pombe , cig1 and cig2 - associated kinases promote DNA replication , but as in S . cerevisiae , the mitotic cyclin cdc13 can function in their absence . In higher eukaryotes , cyclin E – CDKs — directly or indirectly — and cyclin A – CDKs promote DNA replication 71 . Mitotic CDKs are activated at the onset of mitosis and , among other processes , promote chromosome condensation , formation of the mitotic spindle and breakdown of the nuclear envelope . These functions are performed by CDKs associated with Clb1 , Clb2 , Clb3 , Clb4 and Clb5 ( perhaps also Clb6 ) in budding yeast , cdc13 – cdc2 in fission yeast , and cyclin A and cyclin B - associated kinases in higher eukaryotes . For cells to exit from mitosis , undergo cytokinesis and enter the following G1 , mitotic CDKs must be inactivated 11 , 71 .

This is especially apparent in fission yeast and higher eukaryotes . During exit from mitosis , this process is reversed and chromosomes become less compacted — a process known as decondensation . SPINDLE ELONGATION ( ANAPHASE B ) After the chromosomes have been pulled to centrosomes , the mitotic spindle lengthens ( and in budding yeast , pushes into the growing daughter cell ) , thereby allowing further separation of the chromosomes .

Several lines of evidence indicate that the MEN func - tions in the order outlined in FIG . 2a . Biochemical and genetic evidence indicate that the Ras - like GTPase Tem1 functions at or near the top of the MEN 7 , 9 , 28 , 29 ( FIG . 2a ) . The activity of Tem1 seems to be regulated both by the GEF , Lte1 , and the GAP complex , Bub2 – Bfa1 / Byr4 ( REFS 30 – 35 ; FIG . 2a ) . During — or shortly after — forma - tion of the mitotic spindle , Tem1 localizes preferentially to the cytoplasmic face of the spindle pole body ( SPB ; the yeast functional homologue of the mammalian cen - trosome ) , which is destined to migrate into the bud , the future daughter cell 36 , 37 ( FIG . 3 ) . During late telophase , Tem1 asymmetry is lost and is then found on both SPBs 37 . Bub2 – Bfa1 localizes to SPBs in a similar manner to Tem1 ( REFS 30 , 31 , 37 , 38 ) . Furthermore , the early SPB localization of Tem1 seems to depend on both BUB2 and BFA1 , whereas the localization of Tem1 to SPBs during telophase is independent of BUB2 and BFA1 ( REF . 37 ) . The SPB component , Nud1 , functions as a scaf - fold for the Bub2 – Bfa1 – Tem1 complex and other com - ponents of the MEN on SPBs ( FIG . 2a and 3 ) 29 , 36 , 37 , 39 , 40 . The NUD1 gene is allelic to CDC18 ( A . Amon , unpub - lished observations ) . CDC18 is a previously uncloned gene with temperature - sensitive alleles that cause a telophase arrest , which was found in a screen for genes that are important for cell - cycle progression 41 . Activation of Tem1 is thought to lead to the propaga - tion of a signal to the protein kinase Cdc15 ( REF . 42 ; FIG . The mitotic - exit network Control of Cdc14 activity by the MEN . The activity of Cdc14 is controlled by its inhibitor Cfi1 / Net1 ( REFS 21 – 23 ; reviewed in REF . 24 ; FIG . 1a ) . Throughout G1 , S phase , G2 and early mitosis ( metaphase ) , Cdc14 is held inac - tive by Cfi1 / Net1 in the nucleolus . Cfi1 / Net1 has been proposed to function by occluding the active site of Cdc14 ( REF . 25 ) . During anaphase , Cfi1 / Net1 releases Cdc14 . The MEN is required for the release of Cdc14 , leading to the inactivation of mitotic CDKs ( FIG . 2a ; TABLE 1 ) . When the signalling cascade is inactivated , cells arrest in telophase with Cdc14 sequestered in the nucleolus 21 , 23 . How does activation of the MEN control the associ - ation of Cdc14 with Cfi1 / Net1 ? This is not yet under - stood , but both Cdc14 and Cfi1 are phosphoproteins 21 , which raises the possibility that protein phosphoryla - tion is important in controlling their association . A logical candidate to regulate the association of Cdc14 and Cfi1 / Net1 is Dbf2 , a component of the MEN ( see below ) , as genetic evidence has placed it downstream of the MEN components Tem1 and Cdc15 , but upstream of Cdc14 ( REFS 26 – 29 ) . However , Dbf2 might not control the association between Cdc14 and Cfi1 / Net1 directly , and it is not necessarily the sole reg - ulatory protein . Components of the MEN . The MEN is a signalling cas - cade that consists of Tem1 ( a GTPase ) ; Cdc15 , Dbf2 and Cdc5 ( protein kinases ) ; Cdc14 ; Mob1 ( a Dbf2 - associated factor ) ; Bub2 – Bfa1 / Byr4 ( a two - component Box 2 | Control of mitosis by the anaphase - promoting complex The onset of sister - chromatid separation defines the metaphase – anaphase transition . Until then , sister chromatids are held together by a protein complex called COHESIN . Sister - chromatid separation is initiated when a protease called Separase ( Esp1 in budding yeast , cut1 in fission yeast ) cleaves one of the cohesin subunits . Until the onset of anaphase , Separase is kept inactive by its inhibitor , Securin ( Pds1 in budding yeast , cut2 in fission yeast ) . Securin is inactivated at the onset of anaphase by a ubiquitin - dependent proteolysis machinery , termed the anaphase - promoting complex / cyclosome ( APC / C ) , which , together with its specificity factor Cdc20 , ubiquitylates Securin and targets it for degradation . This allows for Separase to become active and sister - chromatid separation to be initiated ( reviewed in REF . 126 ) . The cell has several safeguards to prevent either the mis - segregation of genetic material or the segregation of damaged genetic material . The mitotic spindle - assembly checkpoint blocks the activity of the APC / C – Cdc20 . A protein called Mad2 , with the help of other checkpoint components , binds to APC / C – Cdc20 , thereby blocking its activity ( reviewed in REFS 62 , 127 ) . DNA damage activates a surveillance mechanism , called the DNA - damage checkpoint ( reviewed in REF . 63 ) . In budding yeast , activation of this checkpoint causes cell - cycle arrest at metaphase by stabilization of the anaphase inhibitor , Securin . Mitotic CDK inactivation is also initiated at the metaphase – anaphase transition by APC / C – Cdc20 . APC / C – Cdc20 seems to be mainly responsible for the inactivation of mitotic CDKs during mitosis . In budding yeast , a pool of mitotic CDKs persists until elongation of the mitotic spindle has been completed . Degradation of mitotic cyclins during telophase and G1 is controlled by the APC / C and the Cdh1 specificity factor ( reviewed in REF . 1 ) . Recently , a protein called Mad2L2 / Mad2B has been shown to inhibit the APC / C – Cdh1 ( REFS 128 , 129 ) , which is similar to the role of Mad2 in blocking the APC / C – Cdc20 . It is possible that this protein , too , could function in a surveillance mechanism .

Only when all the inhibitory signals have been removed and positive sig - nals are in place can the full activation of the pathway occur , which allows exit from mitosis to proceed ( FIG . 2a ) . Nuclear position . Tem1 resides preferentially on the SPB , which moves into the daughter cell in which the exchange factor Lte1 is present 36 , 37 ( reviewed in REF . 52 ) . It has been proposed that translocation of the SPB ( con - taining Tem1 ) into the bud ( containing Lte1 ) is one sig - nal that can lead to the activation of Tem1 . In mutants in which the mitotic spindle is misaligned and anaphase occurs in the mother cell ( nuclear - position defect ) , both the release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus and exit from mitosis are delayed until the spindle has been reposi - tioned to reach into the daughter cell 36 , 37 , 53 – 58 . The overex - pression of Lte1 , which forces high levels of this protein into the mother cell , can partially alleviate this delay 36 . Bub2 – Bfa1 is also required to prevent mitotic exit when the mitotic spindle is misaligned 36 , 37 , 55 – 58 . However , it is unclear whether and how the activity of the com - plex is regulated . Phosphorylation of Bfa1 changes dur - ing the cell cycle , indicating that Bub2 – Bfa1 activity is subject to cell - cycle regulation 51 . One signal controlling the activity of Bub2 – Bfa1 has been proposed to be the presence of cytoplasmic microtubules in the bud neck 58 . It is curious that the deletion of either GAP compo - 2a ) . Indeed , Cdc15 also localizes to the cytoplasmic face of SPBs , although the exact localization pattern differs depending on the epitope used to tag Cdc15 and also on the experimental design ( FIG . 3 ) 29 , 40 , 43 – 45 . Furthermore , Cdc15 co - immunoprecipitates with Tem1 ( REF . 36 ) , and an 82 - amino - acid domain adjacent to the amino - termi - nal kinase domain in Cdc15 is sufficient for interaction between Cdc15 and Tem1 in a yeast two - hybrid assay 46 . However , whether there is a direct interaction between Cdc15 and Tem1 in vivo , and whether it occurs only when Tem1 is bound to GTP is , at present , unclear . Cdc15 is then thought to activate the protein kinase , Dbf2 . Indeed , Cdc15 can activate Dbf2 in vitro by phos - phorylating it on Ser374 and Thr544 ( REF . 47 ) . This acti - vating phosphorylation by Cdc15 requires the presence of a Dbf2 - associated factor , Mob1 ( REFS 47 – 49 ) . The POLO KINASE Cdc5 is also necessary for mitotic exit 50 , although its role in the pathway seems complex , which indicates that it might act at more than one point to regulate exit from mitosis 28 , 29 , 51 . Cdc5 somehow pro - motes the kinase activity of Dbf2 ( REFS 28 , 29 ) and is thought to activate Bub2 – Bfa1 ( REF . 51 ) . Signals that control the MEN Recent work has illuminated some of the cellular events that control the MEN , and has given rise to a picture with more than one signal controlling this network .

Figure 1 | Cdc14 and clp1 / flp1 control mitotic CDK activity . a | Cdc14 inhibits mitotic CDKs by reversing mitotic CDK - dependent phosphorylation on various proteins , among which are proteins crucial for downregulating mitotic CDKs , such as the CDK inhibitor Sic1 , the transcription factor Swi5 , and the anaphase - promoting complex / cyclosome ( APC / C ) specificity factor , Cdh1 / Hct1 . During anaphase , Cdc14 is released from its inhibitor Cfi1 / Net1 . The mitotic - exit network ( MEN ) is required to maintain the dissociation between Cdc14 and Cfi1 / Net1 ( REFS 21 , 23 ) . It is probable that factors other than the MEN control the association of Cdc14 and Cfi1 / Net1 . b | clp1 / flp1 regulates mitotic CDKs by inhibiting cdc25 , activating wee1 , or promoting both events 69 , 70 . The similarity in localization of Cdc14 and clp1 / flp1 raises the possibility that clp1 / flp1 is regulated by a catalytic inhibitor that is analogous to Cfi1 / Net1 and resides in the nucleolus . An active septation - initiation network ( SIN ) is needed to maintain clp1 / flp1 in its released state . Whether it promotes export out of the nucleolus or inhibits the return of clp1 / flp1 into the nucleolus is unclear . As the release of clp1 / flp1 from the nucleolus is independent of the SIN , other cellular factors must exist that control the release of clp1 / flp1 from the nucleolus 69 , 70 .

Microtubule integrity and DNA damage . Surveillance mechanisms — termed the spindle - assembly check - point and the DNA - damage checkpoint — monitor for problems , such as defects in the attachment of micro - tubules to the KINETOCHORE or DNA damage , respectively ( for reviews see REFS 62 , 63 ) . Activation of either check - point prevents the degradation of Pds1 , leading to metaphase arrest ( BOX 2 ) . Interestingly , DNA damage can also stabilize Pds1 in cells arrested in late anaphase / telophase 57 , 60 . Stabilized Pds1 inhibits both sister - chromatid separation and activation of Cdc14 under these conditions . The mechanism whereby Pds1 controls Cdc14 activation is not known . The two - component GAP , Bub2 – Bfa1 , is also need - ed to inhibit the MEN during metaphase arrest induced by a defective mitotic spindle 31 , 35 , 38 , 57 , 64 . Furthermore , Bfa1 is hyperphosphorylated when the mitotic spindle checkpoint is activated , raising the pos - sibility that the activity of Bub2 – Bfa1 is under the con - trol of the checkpoint 51 . Two recent reports have addressed the role of Bub2 – Bfa1 in inhibiting the MEN in response to DNA damage . But whereas Wang and nent ( BUB2 or BFA1 ) or the GEF , LTE1 , does not result in an extreme cell - cycle phenotype at room temperature . Deletion of BUB2 or BFA1 has no detectable phenotype at any temperature . LTE1 is essential for mitotic exit at low temperatures but is less important at higher temper - atures . It has been proposed that , at room temperature , the positioning of the nucleus is fast relative to cytokine - sis , and so a phenotype is not detected in cells 37 . It is also possible that yet - undiscovered regulators have redundant roles in activating and inactivating Tem1 . Alternatively , regulation of MEN components other than Tem1 could account for the correct timing of Cdc14 release from Cfi1 / Net1 in the absence of the GAP and GEF activities . Machinery controlling sister - chromatid separation . SECURIN ( Pds1 ) is a negative regulator of SEPARASE ( Esp1 ) which is responsible for separating SISTER CHROMATIDS at the metaphase – anaphase transition ( BOX 2 ; reviewed in REF . 3 ) . Interestingly , both sister - chromatid separation and exit from mitosis are delayed in esp1 mutants or cells overexpressing a stabilized version of Pds1 . This finding indicates that ESP1 is somehow required for the efficient activation of Cdc14 and / or that PDS1 prevents the activation of Cdc14 ( REFS 59 , 60 ) . The inhibitory effects of a stabilized version of Pds1 on mitotic exit and the requirement of ESP1 for mitotic exit can be alleviat - ed by deleting BUB2 ( REFS 51 , 57 , 61 ) .

After sid2 – mob1 kinase is activated at SPBs , it localizes to the medial ring to promote septum formation 87 – 89 . Mitotic CDKs inhibit the SIN through sid1 – cdc14 ( REF . 83 ) .

In some way , clp1 + / flp1 + is also important for cytoki - nesis . A small percentage of cells deleted for clp1 + / flp1 + show defects in septum formation 69 , 70 . The role of clp1 + / flp1 + in cytokinesis remains to be determined . Control of clp1 / flp1 by the SIN The subcellular localization of clp1 / flp1 changes during the cell cycle . Whereas clp1 / flp1 is present in the nucleo - lus and on SPBs during G1 and S phase , it is released from the nucleolus during early mitosis . It then localizes to the mitotic spindle and MEDIAL RING 69 , 70 . An active SIN is needed to maintain clp1 / flp1 in its released state ( FIG . 1b ; TABLE 1 ) . How clp1 / flp1 is held in the nucleolus and how the SIN regulates the subcellular localization of clp1 / flp1 is not understood . The septation - initiation network Control of formation of the septum is governed by the SIN — a signalling cascade of proteins with similarity to those of the MEN ( TABLE 1 ) . The SIN consists of spg1 ( a GTPase ) ; cdc7 , sid1 , sid2 and plo1 ( protein kinases ) ; cdc14 ( a sid1 - associated factor ) ; mob1 ( a sid2 - associat - ed factor ) ; and cdc16 – byr4 ( GAP components ) . Inactivation of the SIN results in the formation of elon - gated , multinucleated cells that cannot form a division septum . When the SIN is hyperactivated , cells form sev - eral septa ( reviewed in REFS 4 , 72 ) . The order in which the components of the SIN func - tion is well understood and remarkably similar to that of the MEN ( FIG . 2b ) . The GTPase , spg1 , is thought to func - tion near or at the top of the SIN 73 . The spg1 protein localizes to SPBs throughout the cell cycle , and this local - ization is probably important for function 74 ( FIG . 4 ) . The two - component GAP , cdc16 – byr4 , inhibits spg1 until the initiation of mitosis 75 – 80 . When the metaphase spindle has formed , cdc16 – byr4 dissociates from both SPBs , and this is believed to lead to the activation of spg1 and recruit - ment of cdc7 to both SPBs . At the onset of anaphase , cdc16 – byr4 localizes to only one SPB ( FIG . 4 ) . As cdc16 – byr4 moves on and off SPBs , cdc7 is always associ - ated with the SPB from which the cdc16 – byr4 complex is absent , indicating that cdc16 – byr4 prevents the recruit - ment of cdc7 ( REFS 81 , 82 ) . Localization of spg1 , cdc7 and byr4 to the SPB depends on two components of the SPB , sid4 and cdc11 ( REFS 83 , 84 ) , which are thought to function as anchors for these proteins . cdc11 binds to — and requires sid4 to localize to — the SPB , and both proteins are needed to anchor SIN components 84 . During anaphase , the protein kinase sid1 , complexed with cdc14 ( no relation to its S . cerevisiae namesake ) , localizes to the cdc7 - containing SPB — but only once mitotic kinase activity has been lowered below a critical threshold 85 . The sid2 protein kinase and its associated factor , mob1 , localize to SPBs throughout the cell cycle 86 – 89 . However , it is thought that only after the sid2 kinase is activated at SPBs ( in a cdc7 - and sid1 - cdc14 - depen - dent manner ) can sid2 and mob1 localize to the medial ring 87 – 89 . The mob1 and sid2 proteins are the only colleagues 57 concluded that Bub2 – Bfa1 is required for metaphase arrest in response to DNA damage , Krishnan and colleagues 34 concluded that they are not . The reason for this discrepancy is not clear , but it might reflect differences in strain backgrounds and / or the experimental procedures used . Inactivation of mitotic CDKs in fission yeast Like in S . cerevisiae , the inactivation of mitotic CDKs is required for exit from mitosis in the fission yeast S . pombe 65 . Degradation of cdc13 is probably brought about by the APC / C and the Cdc20 homologue , slp1 . The Cdh1 / Hct1 homologue , ste9 , and the CDK inhibitor , rum1 ( a functional homologue of Sic1 ) , are not important for mitotic CDK inactivation , but are required for keeping mitotic CDK levels low during G1 ( REFS 66 – 68 ) . Clp1 / flp1 regulates mitotic CDK activity Recently , a homologue of S . cerevisiae Cdc14 — clp1 / flp1 — has been identified in S . pombe 69 , 70 . The clp1 + / flp1 + gene is not essential , but deletion of this gene does cause cells to enter mitosis prematurely . Conversely , overexpression of clp1 + / flp1 + causes cells to arrest in G2 , indicating that this gene inhibits mitotic CDK activity 69 , 70 . However , unlike its S . cerevisiae homo - logue , clp1 / flp1 seems to regulate the inactivation of mitotic CDKs by controlling the phosphorylation status of tyrosine 15 of cdc2 , the sole CDK in S . pombe . In S . pombe and higher eukaryotes , mitotic CDKs are kept inactive during G2 through the phosphoryla - tion of a highly conserved tyrosine residue ( Tyr15 ) in the CDK subunit ( reviewed in REF . 71 ) . The protein kinase wee1 phosphorylates Tyr15 , whereas the protein phosphatase cdc25 dephosphorylates this residue . The clp1 / flp1 protein is thought to promote tyrosine phos - phorylation of cdc2 by the inhibition of cdc25 , the acti - vation of wee1 , or by the promotion of both events . The molecular mechanisms of clp1 / flp1 action are unknown at present . So , it seems that clp1 / flp1 acts MEDIAL RING A structure in fission yeast , containing F - actin and numerous other proteins , which marks the eventual site of the division septum .

The checkpoint arrest depends on polymerized F - ACTIN , wee1 and clp1 / flp1 , as well as the SIN 69 , 70 , 93 – 95 . It is unclear how the SIN senses defects in medial - ring formation and how the SIN pre - vents cell - cycle progression under conditions in which a septum fails to form . However , it is tempting to specu - late that , in analogy to the MEN functioning through Cdc14 to downregulate mitotic CDKs , in this check - point the SIN might function through clp1 / flp1 to pro - mote Tyr15 phosphorylation of cdc2 , leading to the inhibition of mitotic CDK activity and a G2 arrest . Higher eukaryotes Finding true homologues for components of Ras - like signalling cascades is challenging , as the large amount of conservation among family members can make it diffi - cult to detect conservation of homologues between species . However , the GTPases Tem1 and spg1 are most similar to the RAB FAMILY of GTPases . To our knowledge , no known Rabs in higher eukaryotes have been found that have a defect in exit from mitosis or cytokinesis , or localize to the centrosome . Likewise , true Cdc15 / cdc7 or sid1 homologues have yet to be found . One intriguing possibility for a homologue of the two - component GAP , Bub2 / cdc16 – Bfa1 / byr4 , is the human protein , GAPCENA ( for ‘GAP and centrosome associated’ ) 96 . GAPCENA was identified through a yeast two - hybrid screen as interacting with the GTPase Rab6 , which is involved in transport between the Golgi body and the endoplasmic reticulum 97 . GAPCENA has GAP pathway components that are seen at the site of the division septum , leading to the hypothesis that these proteins carry the ‘make a septum’message to the site of cytokinesis ( FIG . 4 ) . The polo kinase encoded by the plo1 + gene is essen - tial for septation 90 . Furthermore , overexpression of plo1 + can drive septation in interphase , allowing tran - sient recruitment of cdc7 to the SPB . This has led to the idea that plo1 acts in a positive regulatory manner upstream of the SIN pathway 90 – 92 and that , perhaps , plo1 + is involved in removing cdc16 – byr4 from SPBs . Signals controlling the SIN To date , there are two signals known to control the SIN — mitotic CDK activity and the cytokinesis checkpoint . Mitotic CDK activity . Inactivation of mitotic CDKs is required for the formation of the division septum 85 . The sid1 – cdc14 complex seems to be a sensor for the state of mitotic CDK activity within cells , and only when the CDK activity has dropped below a certain low threshold can sid1 – cdc14 localize to the SPB , which contains spg1 ( REF . 85 ) . Through this dependency , the cell ensures that septum formation does not occur during mitosis , when mitotic CDK activity is high . Consistent with this idea , hyperactivation of the SIN leads to ectopic formation of a septum , but only during those stages of the cell cycle when mitotic CDK activity is low — that is , during interphase and late stages of mitosis 73 , 90 . The cytokinesis checkpoint . The cytokinesis checkpoint in S . pombe was uncovered through the identification of mutations in the cps1 + / drc1 + gene , a subunit of the Nucleus Microtubules Tem1 , Bub2 – Bfa on daughter - bound SPB , Cdc5 accumulates in nucleus Cdc15 , Dbf2 – Mob1 , Cdc5 on SPBs , Cdc5 also on mitotic spindle Cdc15 , Dbf2 – Mob1 , Cdc5 to bud neck Cdc14 release Medial ring splitting Medial ring MEN cleared from SPBs MEN cleared from site of cytokinesis G1 S phase Metaphase Anaphase Telophase G1 Lte1 Nud1 Tem1 , Bub2 – Bfa1 Cdc15 , Dbf2 – Mob1 SPB Lte1sequestedinto bud Mitotic spindle Figure 3 | Localization of MEN components during the cell cycle . Lte1 is present throughout the cell during G1 , and localizes to the bud during S phase and mitosis . Nud1 functions as an anchor for MEN components 40 , 130 . As the mitotic spindle forms , Tem1 and Bub2 – Bfa1 localize to the spindle pole body ( SPB ) that migrates into the bud 30 , 31 , 36 – 38 . During anaphase , Cdc15 and Dbf2 – Mob1 are recruited to SPBs . The exact nature of Cdc15 and Dbf2 localization is unclear . Two reports find that Cdc15 is always associated with the mother SPB and localizes to the daughter only during anaphase and telophase 43 , 45 . Other groups report that Cdc15 localizes to both SPBs only during anaphase and telophase 29 , 40 , 44 . Endogenous Dbf2 fused to three Myc epitopes or to a single molecule of green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) localizes to both SPBs during anaphase and telophase 29 , 115 , 118 , whereas the expression of three copies of DBF2 – GFP leads to the association of Dbf2 with SPBs throughout the cell cycle 115 . The Mob1 localization pattern is similar to that of Dbf2 . It is found on both SPBs during anaphase and telophase 118 . Cdc5 localizes to the nucleus during metaphase and anaphase and is also found on SPBs and the site of cytokinesis during anaphase 8 , 117 , 131 .

Human CDC14A and CDC14B have both been shown to associate with p53 in a yeast two - hybrid assay and by co - immunoprecipitation . Both can also dephosphorylate p53 on Ser315 . Li and co - work - ers 110 proposed that this dephosphorylation might acti - vate p53 , possibly by directing p53 into the nucleus . It will be interesting to evaluate the relevance of CDC14 in mitotic CDK and p53 regulation in vivo . A role for the centrosome ? Recent work has implicated the centrosome in the control of cytokinesis in mammalian cells 112 , 113 . Each centrosome is composed ofan old CENTRIOLE ( from the previous cell cycle ) and a new centriole ( dupli - cated during the current cell cycle ) . Analysis of green fluo - rescent protein ( GFP ) - labelled centrioles has shown that there is a very fast repositioning of the old centriole into the intercellular bridge , the thin region of cytoplasm that separates the two daughter cells . Ablation of the centro - some does not affect nuclear division , but leads to defects in cytokinesis 112 , 113 . Is the centrosome , like the SPB in S . cerevisiae and S . pombe , anchoring signalling networks needed for the completion of the cell cycle ? Comparing the SIN and the MEN At a first glance , one might think that the functions of the SIN and the MEN are quite different — the SIN regulates the formation of the division septum after mitotic CDK inactivation , whereas the MEN controls mitotic CDK inactivation . Recent evidence , however , indicates that the MEN also regulates cytokinesis and there are some hints that the SIN , at least under some circumstances , controls mitotic CDK activity through clp1 + / flp1 + . The MEN and cytokinesis . When the mitotic - exit func - tion of Tem1 is bypassed by a net1 - 1 allele , tem1 mutants activity towards Rab6 ( REF . 96 ) , and it shares homology with Bub2 and cdc16 . Interestingly , a pool of GAPCE - NA localizes to centrosomes . Whether GAPCENA regu - lates an as - yet - unidentified Tem1 / spg1 homologue on the centrosome , or whether Rab6 is the Tem1 / spg1 homologue , is not known . The Drosophila melanogaster gene , warts , was identi - fied as a tumour suppressor 98 , 99 and has similarity to Dbf2 / sid2 . Interestingly , human WARTS ( LATS1 ) has been shown to interact directly with CDC2in mitosis 100 . WARTS / LATS1 localizes to the centrosome in interphase , translocates to the mitotic spindle in metaphase and anaphase , and then localizes to the MIDBODY in telophase 101 . The Dbf2 / sid2 - associated factor , Mob1 / mob1 , also has numerous homologues in higher eukaryotes 48 , 102 . Cdc5 / plo1 are members of the polo kinase family , which includes Drosophila Polo , Xenopus laevis Plx1 and mammalian Plk , Snk , Sak and Fnk / Prk ( reviewed in REF . 103 ) . Work in Xenopus has demonstrated that Plx1 activity is needed for exit from mitosis in egg extracts 104 . Various polo kinases have been found to localize to the centrosome and CLEAVAGEFURROW 105 – 108 , and recently it was shown 108 that mouse Sak ( a polo kinase family member ) also localizes to the nucleolus . Together these data indi - cate that polo kinases are probably involved in the con - trol of exit from mitosis and cytokinesis . Human homologues of Cdc14 / clp1 / flp1 — CDC14A and CDC14B — have been identified 109 . Although not extensively studied , it seems that CDC14 can cause CDK inactivation 110 , 111 . Overexpression of human CDC14A in mouse NIH3T3 cells alleviates a telophase block imposed by expression of a non - degradable version of cyclin B and allows for mouse Cdh1 to associate with the APC / C 111 . It is not yet known whether CDC14 can also regulate mitotic CDKs through tyrosine phosphorylation . MIDBODY A region of dense matrix material visible in higher eukaryotic cells by electron microscopy . The midbody remains between two daughter cells after the cleavage furrow has contracted . CLEAVAGE FURROW A region of the cell membrane in higher eukaryotic cells that ingresses ; thought to be a result of contraction of actin and myosin rings .

CDK , cyclin - dependent kinase . © 2001 Macmillan Magazines Ltd NATURE REVIEWS | MOLECULAR CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 2 | NOVEMBER 2001 | 823 R E V I E W S Cdc14 tightly sequestered in the nucleolus . This led to the proposal that the MEN is required for the release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus 21 , 23 . Recent data , however , have shown that Cdc14 is transiently released from the nucleolus during early mitosis in a MEN - independent manner and that the MEN is required to maintain Cdc14 in a released state ( F . Stegmeier & R . Visintin , unpublished data ) . This observation raises the interest - ing possibility that the control of Cdc14 and clp1 / flp1 release is similar — that is , the MEN , like SIN activity , is needed to hold Cdc14 out of the nucleolus . Cyclin degradation versus tyrosine phosphorylation . Both Cdc14 and clp1 / flp1 promote mitotic CDK inac - tivation , but by different means . Whereas S . pombe clp1 / flp1 inhibits mitotic CDKs by the promotion of tyrosine phosphorylation on cdc2 , budding yeast Cdc14 inhibits mitotic CDKs by promoting the degra - dation of mitotic cyclins . These findings add to the body of evidence that the critical regulation of mitotic CDK activity in S . pombe is through the phosphoryla - tion status of cdc2 , whereas control of mitotic CDK activity in S . cerevisiae is in large part mediated by cyclin degradation ( reviewed in REFS 12 , 71 ) . Budding yeast Cdc14 seems to have a high affinity for CDK phosphorylation consensus sites 14 , 15 , 119 . Whether clp1 / flp1 uses a similar mechanism to promote cdc2 inactivation remains to be determined . Conclusions and prospects We would like to propose that although they differ in detail , the MEN and the SIN have similar functions in budding and fission yeast . Both downregulate mitotic CDKs and promote cytokinesis . However , whereas the primary concern of the MEN is mitotic CDK inactiva - tion through Cdc14 , the main interest of the SIN is cytokinesis . Furthermore , both pathways control a phosphatase ( Cdc14 or clp1 / flp1 ) that inhibits mitotic CDKs , albeit through different strategies . A lot of progress has been made towards under - standing the MEN and the SIN over the past two years . However , it is clear that key questions remain . To understand in detail how the cell ensures that exit from mitosis and cytokinesis occurs only at the end of each cell cycle , it will be crucial to identify all the sig - nals that control the activity of the MEN and the SIN and to determine the mechanisms through which these signals regulate the activity of these two sig - nalling pathways . It will also be important to deter - mine the molecular details by which these cascades control cytokinesis and the activity of Cdc14 and clp1 / flp1 . Finally , it is clear that some components of the MEN and the SIN have homologues in higher eukaryotes . Deciphering their role in cell - cycle pro - gression and determining whether they function in signalling cascades analogous to the MEN and the SIN might not only shed light on how exit from mitosis and cytokinesis are regulated in higher eukaryotes , but could also help us to explain some of the mechanisms that lead to ANEUPLOIDY , which is often associated with cancerous transformation . show defects in cytokinesis 21 . Furthermore , a specific CDC15 allele , cdc15 - lyt1 , is defective in cytokinesis 114 . Finally , GFP - tagged versions of Cdc15 , Dbf2 , Mob1 and Cdc5 are detected at the bud neck in late mito - sis 44 , 115 – 118 . Interestingly , the accumulation of Dbf2 and Mob1 at the bud neck depends on CDC14 ( REFS 115 , 118 ) . We speculate that in budding yeast , the role of the MEN in mitotic CDK inactivation and cytokinesis rep - resents sequential steps . The MEN first promotes the dissociation of Cdc14 from Cfi1 / Net1 , and therefore loss of mitotic CDK activity . The absence of mitotic CDKs and the presence of active Cdc14 then causes dephosphorylation of CDK consensus sites , leading to the dephosphorylation of Cdc15 ( REF . 119 ) ( and perhaps other components of the MEN ) . This allows compo - nents of the MEN to localize to the bud neck , where they regulate cytokinesis . It is possible that the MEN controls the activity of IQGAP ( Iqg1 / Cyk1 in budding yeast ) — a key regulator of actomyosin ring assembly and contraction — as Tem1 has been shown to interact with this protein in vitro 120 . Furthermore , TEM1 is required for proper ACTOMYOSIN AND SEPTIN DYNAMICS 28 , 115 , 121 , indicating that TEM1 could be a key regulator of acto - myosin ring assembly and contraction . Clearly , deter - mining the mechanism by which the MEN regulate cytokinesis will probably provide key insights into how cytokinesis is regulated . The SIN and mitotic CDK inactivation . The SIN is required to maintain a low mitotic CDK state when the cytokinesis checkpoint is activated , indicating that the SIN can inhibit mitotic CDKs 69 , 70 . The maintenance of a low mitotic CDK state in this checkpoint arrest also depends on clp1 / flp1 and tyrosine phosphorylation of cdc2 ( REFS 69 , 70 ) . Perhaps , under conditions when the cytokinesis checkpoint is activated — such as the MEN in S . cerevisiae — the SIN can induce activation of clp1 / flp1 by facilitating nucleolar release , which then promotes tyrosine phosphorylation of cdc2 , leading to the inactivation of mitotic CDKs . An inappropriately active SIN also triggers the inacti - vation of mitotic CDKs in cells that are arrested in mito - sis due to activation of the mitotic spindle checkpoint ( reviewed in REF . 122 ) . The cdc16 - 116 mutation allows cells to bypass the arrest 74 , 76 , 85 , as the cells can inactivate mitotic CDKs and undergo cytokinesis . Perhaps the lack of functional cdc16 – byr4 GAP initiates a positive - feed - back loop in which a hyperactivated SIN promotes clp1 / flp1 activity , leading to the inactivation of mitotic CDKs . Loss of mitotic CDK activity in turn causes fur - ther activation of the SIN . This hypothesis predicts that the bypass of the mitotic spindle checkpoint arrest seen in cdc16 - 116 mutants depends on clp1 + / flp1 + . Control of Cdc14 or clp1 / flp1 localization . In fission yeast , clp1 / flp1 becomes released from the nucleolus during early mitosis in a SIN - independent manner 69 , 70 . However , the SIN is needed to keep clp1 / flp1 released — at least when the cytokinesis checkpoint is activated 70 . This is in contrast to Cdc14 in S . cerevisiae , in which temperature - sensitive alleles of the MEN have ACTOMYOSIN AND SEPTIN DYNAMICS Actomyosin and septin dynamics refers to the contraction of actin , myosin , and septin rings , which is concurrent with cytokinesis in eukaryotic cells .

The authors determine the localization of Tem1 and Lte1 during the cell cycle , and find that the nuclear - positioning defects observed in cells that lack cytoplasmic dynein cause a delay in exit from mitosis due to a failure to release Cdc14 from Cfi1 / Net1 . A model is proposed whereby the cell uses the position of the nucleus to control mitotic exit . By spatially segregating GTPase and GEF activities until the appropriate time , the cell links nuclear migration to mitotic exit . 37 .

The localization of the mitotic - exit components , Bub2 , Bfa1 , Tem1 ( on the spindle pole body ) and Lte1 ( in the bud ) is shown . The authors also find that Bub2 and Bfa1 have a role in preventing mitotic exit when astral microtubules are perturbed , whereas the mitotic - spindle checkpoint component Mad2 does not . They show that the activity of Bub2 – Bfa1 correlates to the position of the mitotic spindle . When nuclear division occurs in the mother cell , which leads to mis - positioning of the mitotic spindle , the MEN is inhibited in a BUB2 - and BFA1 - dependent manner . The authors propose that the position of the mitotic spindle controls the timing of mitotic exit . 38 . Fraschini , R . , Formenti , E . , Lucchini , G . & Piatti , S .

J . The spindle checkpoint of Saccharomyces cerevisiae responds to separable microtubule - dependent events . Curr . Biol . 10 , 1375 – 1378 ( 2000 ) . The authors first show that Bub2 – GFP localizes to the cytoplasmic face of the SPB . Then the relative roles of the Bub2 and Mad2 branches of the spindle checkpoint are investigated . When the mitotic spindle is mis - positioned , a proportion of these cells delay mitosis until the spindle is repositioned and consequently , normal cells with 1N DNA content result . However , when BUB2 is deleted , a proportion of these cells mis - segregate DNA due to an inability to delay mitosis . By contrast , deletion of MAD2 has no effect and cells can still delay mitosis until the nucleus is repositioned . A model is proposed whereby the Bub2 checkpoint monitors cytoplasmic microtubule events and the Mad2 checkpoint monitors nuclear microtubule events . 57 . Wang , Y . , Hu , F . & Elledge , S . J . The Bfa1 / Bub2 GAP complex comprises a universal checkpoint required to prevent mitotic exit . Curr . Biol . 10 , 1379 – 1382 ( 2000 ) . Bub2 and Bfa1 are found to be essential for inhibiting mitotic exit in a DNA - damage - induced metaphase arrest . Likewise , Bub2 and Bfa1 are found to be essential for preventing mitotic exit in situations in which the spindle is mis - aligned and anaphase occurs in the mother cell . The authors propose a model in which the Bub2 and Bfa1 GAP is needed for inhibition of the mitotic - exit pathway in all situations in which the cell arrests in G2 / M with high CDK activity , such as DNA - damage - and spindle - damage - induced arrests as well as spindle - positioning defects . 58 .

This paper indicates that the presence of cytoplasmic microtubules in the bud neck might provide an inhibitory signal for the MEN by regulating the activity of Bub2 – Bfa1 . The authors correlate the loss of cytoplasmic microtubules from the bud neck with exit from mitosis . In mutants defective in cytoplasmic microtubule nucleation , exit from mitosis occurs inappropriately . The authors also propose that LTE1 has no role in controlling the activity of the MEN , at least at high temperatures . 59 . Cohen - Fix , O . & Koshland , D .

Cueille , N . et al . S . pombe cdc14 orthologue . J . Cell Sci . ( in the press ) . A S . pombe orthologue of S . cerevisiae CDC14 , called flp1 + , was identified and proposed to have a reduced role in cell - cycle regulation . Localization of flp1 is similar to that of Cdc14 in S . cerevisiae : it is in the nucleolus and on the SPB during interphase , and becomes re - localized to the mitotic spindles , the nucleus and contractile ring during mitosis . flp1 inhibits mitotic CDKs by regulating the tyrosine 15 phosphorylation of cdc2 . The role of the SIN in flp1 release is also discussed , as well as a role for both in the cytokinesis checkpoint . The SIN and flp1 seem to be involved in a feedback loop , and the authors propose that , although flp1 is not the essential effector of the SIN , flp1 might help potentiate SIN signalling . 70 . Trautmann , S . et al . Fission yeast Clp1p phosphatase regulates G2 / M transition and coordination of cytokinesis with cell cycle progression . Curr . Biol . 11 , 931 – 940 ( 2001 ) . clp1 + was identified as a S . cerevisiae CDC14 orthologue in S . pombe . The authors show that clp1 functions in G2 by inhibiting cdc2 through regulation of tyrosine 15 phosphorylation . clp1 + is also needed for the cytokinesis checkpoint , which blocks cells in G2 in response to the inability to properly form a septum . Clp1 is nucleolar and found on the SPB during interphase , and becomes nuclear and localizes to the septum during mitosis . An active SIN pathway is needed to maintain clp1 release from the nucleolus . The authors conclude that clp1 regulates the cell cycle in a very different way from Cdc14 . 71 . Morgan , D . O .
