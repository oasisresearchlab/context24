A . , Mur - phy , R . F . , and Jones , E . W . ( 1989 ) Proc . Natl . Acad . Sci . U . S . A . 86 , 7027 - 7031 ) . Vacuoles purified from yeast bearing the vphl - 1 mutation had no detectable bafilomycin - sensitive ATPase activity or ATP - de - pendent proton pumping . The peripherally bound nu - cleotide - binding subunits of the vacuolar H’ - ATPase ( 60 and 69 kDa ) were no longer associated with vacu - olar membranes yet were present in wild type levels in yeast whole cell extracts . The VPHl gene was cloned by complementation of the vphl - 1 mutation and inde - pendently cloned by screening a Xgt 11 expression li - brary with antibodies directed against a 95 - kDa vac - uolar integral membrane protein . Deletion disruption of the VPHl gene revealed that the VPHl gene is not essential for viability but is required for vacuolar H’ - ATPase assembly and vacuolar acidification . VPHl encodes a predicted polypeptide of 840 amino acid residues ( molecular mass 95 . 6 kDa ) and contains six putative membrane - spanning regions . Cell fractiona - tion and immunodetection demonstrate that Vphlp is a vacuolar integral membrane protein that co - purifies with vacuolar H + - ATPase activity . Multiple sequence alignments show extensive homology over the entire lengths of the following four polypeptides : Vphlp , the 116 - kDa polypeptide of the rat clathrin - coated vesi - cles / synaptic vesicle proton pump , the predicted poly - peptide encoded by the yeast gene STVl ( Eimilar Eo - VPHl , identified as an open reading frame next to the * This work was supported by a grant from the Medical Research Council of Canada ( to M .

BUB2 gene ) , and the TJ6 mouse immune suppressor factor . The yeast vacuole , like the mammalian lysosome , requires an acidic lumen to perform certain of its cellular functions . The pH difference across the vacuolar membrane provides an electrochemical gradient that drives the secondary transport of a variety of basic amino acids ( Ohsumi and Anraku , 1981 ) and ions ( Ohsumi and Anraku , 1983 ) . The enzyme responsible for the generation of the transmembrane gradient by the active transport of protons is the vacuolar H + - ATPase . Mu - tations in or disruptions of some of the structural genes of the vacuolar H’ - ATPase render yeast cells sensitive to high extracellular Ca2 + concentrations ( Ohya et al . , 1991 ) and neutral buffered medium ( Yamashiro et al . , 1990 ; Foury , 1990 ; Nelson and Nelson , 1990 ) . This demonstrates both the essen - tial role the vacuole plays in Ca2 + homeostasis and the essen - tial role of the vacuolar H + - ATPase for normal vacuolar function . The yeast vacuolar H + - ATPase is a member of the vacuolar - type or V - type H’ - ATPase ( EC 3 . 6 . 1 . 3 ) found in and respon - sible for the acidification of plant and fungal vacuoles , lyso - somes , endosomes , clathrin - coated vesicles , chromaffin gran - ules , synaptic vesicles , and Golgi ( most recently reviewed in Forgac , 1989 ) . V - type ATPases are evolutionary related to FIFO H + - ATPase ( Gogarten et al . , 1989 ) and have a similar multimeric bipartite structure consisting of membrane - bound proton channel and a peripherally bound catalytic core . On the basis of co - purification and immunoprecipitation , the yeast vacuolar H + - ATPase is composed of at least 8 subunits : 100 , 69 , 60 , 42 , 36 , 32 , 27 , and 17 kDa ( Kane et al . , 1989 ) . The structural genes for four of these subunits have been identified redundantly and appear in the literature with the following designations : 69 kDa , TFPl ( Kane et al . , 1990 ) and VMAI ( Hirata et al . , 1990 ) ; 60 kDa , VMA2 ( Anraku et al . , 1989 ) , VATP B ( Nelson et al . , 1989 ) , and VAT2 ( Yamashiro et al . , 1990 ) ; 31 kDa , VMA4 ( Foury , 1990 ) ; 17 kDa , VATPc ( Nelson and Nelson , 1989 ) and VMA3 ( Umemoto et al . , 1990 ) . The peripherally bound catalytic domain is composed of the 69 - and 60 - kDa subunits , both of which contain consensus se - quence nucleotide - binding domains ( 69 kDa : Bowman et al . , 1988a ; Zimniak et al . , 1988 ; Kane et al . , 1990 ; Hirata et al . , 1990 ; 60 kDa : Bowman et al . , 1988b ; Manolson et al . , 1988 ; Nelson et al . , 1989 ) and have been shown to bind ATP analogs in uitro ( Manolson et al . , 1985 ; Randall and Sze , 1987 ; Uchida et al . , 1988 ) . The proton channel through the membrane is 14294 VPHl Encodes a 95 - kDa Yeast thought to be formed by six copies of the DCCD ' - binding 17 - kDa proteolipid ( Rea et al . , 1987 ; Sun et al . , 1987 ; Arai et al . , 1987 ; Kaestner et al . , 1988 ) . Early reports on the partial purification of V - type H + - ATPases from plant and yeast vacuoles , and more recently , the immunoaffinity purification of the bovine kidney V - type H + - ATPase ( Gluck and Caldwell , 1987 ) did not report the presence of any subunits larger than the 70 - kDa nucleotide - binding subunit , Evidence that V - type H + - ATPases do con - tain a 95 - 120 - kDa polypeptide are as follows . 1 ) Removal of the 116 - and 38 - kDa polypeptides from the purified clathrin - coated vesicle H + - ATPase prevented Mg2 + - supported ATP hydrolysis and proton pumping activity ( Xie and Stone , 1988 ) . 2 ) Immunoprecipitation of the coated vesicle H + - ATPase ( Arai et al . , 1988 ) and the yeast vacuolar H + - ATPase ( Kane et al . , 1989 ) with monoclonal antibodies that recognize the native enzyme co - precipitated a 100 - kDa polypeptide . 3 ) An - tibodies specific to a 120 - kDa polypeptide that co - purified with the chromaffin - granule V - type H + - ATPase recognized a 115 - kDa subunit that co - purified with the renal tubule V - type H + - ATPase ( Gillespie et al . , 1991 ) . 4 ) Disruption of the struc - tural gene for the 17 - kDa DCCD - binding subunit of the yeast vacuolar H + - ATPase ( VMA3 ) results in the absence of the 100 - kDa polypeptide in vacuolar membranes and decreased levels in whole cell extracts ( Kane et al . , 1992 ) . 5 ) On the basis of immunofluorescence microscopy on yeast cells , the peripherally bound nucleotide - binding subunits ( 60 and 69 kDa ) appear to block epitope sites on the 100 - kDa polypeptide ( Kane et al . , 1992 ) . In this report we present genetic , biochemical , and sequence data that a vacuolar membrane - bound 95 - kDa polypeptide , encoded by the VPHl gene , is a subunit of the yeast vacuolar ATPase and is required for in vivo enzyme assembly and activity . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Materials - The zwitterionic detergent N - tetradecyl - N , N - di - methyl - 3 - ammonio - 1 - propanesulfonate ( ZW3 - 14 ) was from Calbi - ochem , Lyticase L8137 and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride from Sigma , ATP and pepstatin A from Boehringer Mannheim , 6 - carboxy - fluorescein diacetate ( C1362 ) from Molecular Probes , and Acridine Orange from Kodak . Bafilomycin AI was a kind gift from Dr . Kar - lheinz Altendorf ( University of Osnabruck ) . Random Primer Exten - sion Kit , [ c ~ - ~ * P ] ~ CTP ( 3000 Ci / mmmol ) , and [ 35S ] dATP ( 1000 Ci / mmol ) were from Du Pont - New England Nuclear . Nitrocellulose type HAHY ( 0 . 45 pm ) was purchased from Millipore and nitrocellulose BA85 and Nytran ( 0 . 45 pm ) from Schleicher and Schuell . Goat anti - rabbit IgG - horseradish peroxidase conjugate was obtained from Bio - Rad . Media and Stock Solutions - YEPD medium contained 1 % yeast extract ( Difco ) , 2 % Bacto - peptone ( Difco ) , and 2 % dextrose , synthetic media for yeast were prepared as described in Zubenko et al . ( 1982 ) . Media for propagation of phage and bacteria were made as described in Maniatis et al . ( 1982 ) . A 200 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride stock solution was prepared in isopropyl alcohol and kept at 4 " C , pepstatin A was stored at 1 mg / ml in 66 % ethanol at - 20 " C , 20 mM 6 - carboxyfluorescein diacetate was stored in dimethyl sulfoxide at 4 " C , 0 . 5 mM bafilomycin A , in ethanol was stored at - 20 " C , and a 10 % ZW3 - 14 solution was stored at room temperature . 50 mM Na2ATP was immediately titrated to pH 6 . 9 with Tris base and stored at - 20 " C . Preparation of Whole Cell Yeast Extract - Whole cell extracts were prepared by a Braun homogenizer as described in Jones et al . ( 1982 ) except that homogenization was done at 4 " C in 100 mM Tris - HC1 , pH 7 . 5 , 1 mM EDTA , 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride , and 1 pg / ml pepstatin A . Yeast whole cell extracts were denatured for sodium The abbreviations used are : DCCD , dicyclohexylcarbodiimide ; SDS - PAGE , sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electropho - resis ; kb , kilobase ( s ) ; bp , base pair ( s ) ; Mes , 2 - ( N - morpho - 1ino ) ethanesulfonic acid . Vacuolar H + - ATPase Subunit 14295 dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS - PAGE ) in 63 mM Tris - HC1 , pH 6 . 8 , 1 % SDS , 0 . 6 mM P - mercaptoethanol , and 5 % glycerol for 2 . 5 min at 65 " C . Although these conditions were not optimal for solubilization of most proteins , higher temperatures or longer incubation times resulted in less detectable Vphlp antigen . Purification of Vacuolar Membranes and Vacuolar H + - ATPase - Isolation of vacuolar membranes through flotation of intact vacuoles on Ficoll gradients and the subsequent purification of the vacuolar Hf - ATPase through ultracentrifugation on glycerol gradients were done essentially by the method of Uchida et al . ( 1985 ) with the following modifications . Isolation of vacuolar membranes , assay of their purity , and Na2C03 extraction of the resulting vesicles were done exactly as described in Woolford et al . ( 1990 ) . Purification of the vacuolar H + - ATPase was done with the modifications described in Kane et al . ( 1989 ) with the following exceptions as suggested by Dr . Patricia M . Kane ( The College of William and Mary ) . ZW3 - 14 - solubilized membranes were layered on top of an 11 . 8 - ml step gradient ( 20 - 25 - 30 - 35 - 40 - 45 - 50 % ( v / v ) glycerol ) and centrifuged for 16 h at 180 , 000 X g in a Beckman SW41 rotor . 0 . 6 - ml fractions were collected from the top , and ATPase activity was assayed immediately without adding exogenous phospholipids . Enzyme Assays - Hydrolytic activity of the vacuolar H + - ATPase was assayed for 30 min at 30 " C in 25 mM Mes / Tris , pH 6 . 9 , 5 mM MgC12 , 25 mM KC1 , and 5 mM Na2ATP with released inorganic phosphate determined by the method of Ames ( 1966 ) . Acidification of the lumen of purified intact vacuoles by the vacuolar H + - ATPase was detected by following the rate of fluorescence quenching of acridine orange as described by Rea and Poole ( 1985 ) except that buffer and ion concentrations were as described above for hydrolytic activity . For bafilomycin A , sensitivity in both proton pumping and hydrolytic assays , the protein samples ( which did not exceed 20 pg of protein ) were preincubated in 1 p ~ bafilomycin A , for 10 min prior to the assays . Production of Anti - Vphlp Antisera - Rabbit polyclonal antisera to Vphlp was raised by the method of Vaitukaitis ( 1981 ) with the modifications described in Manolson et al . ( 1989 ) . Vacuolar mem - branes were stripped of peripheral proteins with 100 mM Na2CO3 , pH 11 , as described in Woolford et al . ( 1990 ) , the Na2C03 - insoluble proteins were resuspended in 0 . 5 M Tris - HC1 , pH 8 . 0 , at a concentra - tion no greater that 6 mg / ml and homogenized in a tight - fitting Dounce homogenizer until there were no visible particulates ( about 10 strokes ) . 1 / 4 volume of SDS - PAGE denaturation buffer containing 0 . 315 M Tris - HCI , pH 6 . 8 , 5 % SDS , 3 M 0 - mercaptoethanol , and 50 % glycerol was added , followed by an overnight incubation on ice . The pH was adjusted to neutrality with Tris base , and insoluble matter was removed by centrifugation at 12 , 000 X g for 10 min . 1 . 5 mg of solubilized protein was loaded on a 1 . 5 - mm - thick , 14 . 5 - cm - long , 7 . 5 % polyacrylamide - preparative SDS - PAGE . Vphlp was visualized through KC1 staining , cut out , and prepared for intradermal injections exactly as described in Manolson et al . ( 1989 ) . The rabbit received an initial injection and 4 additional injections spaced 1 month apart ; each injection contained approximately 50 pg of Vphlp . Test bleeds were taken 2 days after injection , the rabbit was killed 8 days after the 5th injection . Affinity Purification of Anti - Vphlp - Raw serum was precipitated by 50 % ( NH4 ) $ 04 , the pellet was resuspended to one - half the original volume and dialyzed extensively against 10 mM Tris - HCI , pH 7 . 3 , 0 . 9 % NaCl ( Tris - saline buffer ) . To remove antibodies directed against carbohydrates moieties , 5 ml of the resulting dialysate was incubated twice with 0 . 3 g wet weight of intact yeast cells for 1 . 5 h at 4 " C with gentle rocking , followed by a short 12 , 000 X g centrifugation to remove the yeast cells . 1 mg of Na2C03 - insoluble vacuolar membrane proteins was prepared and electrophoresed as described above . The protein was transferred to nitrocellulose by the method of Burnette ( 1981 ) and visualized by Ponceau S staining . A small strip ( 0 . 2 X 14 . 5 cm ) containing about 40 pg of Vphlp antigen was cut out and blocked in 3 % bovine serum albumin in Tris - saline buffer for 1 h at 42 " C . The nitrocellulose strip was washed three times for 10 min in Tris - saline buffer and then incubated with 2 ml of the antiserum ( prepared as described above ) overnight at 4 " C with constant shaking . The 2 - ml aliquot was conserved , as affinity purification did not significantly deplete this fraction of anti - Vphlp antibodies . The nitrocellulose strip was washed four times for 10 min in Tris - saline buffer , and antibodies were eluted by incubating the washed strip in 1 ml of ice - cold 200 mM glycine - HC1 , pH 2 . 3 , at 4 " C for 1 h , after which this fraction was immediately neutralized with the addition of 150 p1 ( 15 % v / v final ) of 1 M Tris . The nitrocellulose strip was washed four times 14296 VPHl Encodes a 95 - kDa Yeast Vacuolar Hi - ATPase Subunit TABLE I Yeast strains Strain Genotype BJ2663 MATa trpl urd - 52 BJ3131 MATaIMATa + lade6 + / his1 leu2 - I / leu2 - 1 trpl / + BJ4873 MATa leu2 urd - 52 vphl - l BJ4875 MATa alg6 trpl vphl - l BJ4876 MATa leu2 urd - 52 BJ4877 MATa alg6 trpl vphl - I BJ4878 MATa leu2 urd - 52 BJ4879 MATa alg6 trpl urd - 52 vphl - 1 BJ4886 MATa alg6 urd - 52 vphl - 1 BJ4887 MATa trpl vphl - 1 BJ4888 MATa leu2 urd - 52 BJ5035 MATa leu2 urd - 52 vphl - 1 BJ6716 MATalMATa + lade6 + / his1 leu2 - I / leu2 - I trpl / + BJ6717 MATa ade6 hisl trpl urd - 52 Auph1 : : LEUZ BJ6718 MATa hisl urd - 52 Auphl : : LEU2 BJ6719 MATa leu2 - I urd - 52 BJ6720 MATa adel leu2 - 1 trpl urd - 52 DBY1034 MATa his4 - 539 lys2 - 801 urd - 52 urd - 52 / urd - 52 urd - 52 / urd - 52 Avphl : : LEU2 / VPHI for 10 min in Tris - saline buffer and conserved for another round of affinity purification . DBY1034 was grown in YEPD medium to 5 X lo6 cells / ml . A 100 - ml Electron Microscopy and Zmmunolabeling - The yeast strain culture of cells was harvested and suspended in 25 ml of ice - cold fixative ( 40 mM potassium phosphate , pH 6 . 7 , 1 . 25 M sorbitol , 3 % formaldehyde , 0 . 5 % glutaraldehyde , 1 mM MgCl , , 1 mM CaClJ for 30 min . The fixed cells were washed three times in 40 mM potassium phosphate , pH 6 . 7 , buffer containing first 0 . 75 M sorbitol , then 0 . 25 M sorbitol , and finally no sorbitol . A more detailed description of the fixation conditions will be presented elsewhere . ’ The fixed cells were resuspended in 1 % sodium metaperiodate and then in 50 mM ammonium chloride as described previously ( Van Tuinen and Riezman , 1987 ) . Dehydration was performed on ice by washing the cells in 50 % ice - cold ethanol followed by 70 % , 80 % , 90 % , and 95 % ethanol , and finally by three incubations in 100 % ethanol . The dehydrated cells were infiltrated with L . R . White resin ( Poly - sciences ) and polymerized as described by Wright and Rine ( 1989 ) . Sections measuring 80 to 90 nm ( as determined by a gold interference color ) were cut using a diamond knife and were mounted on 300 - mesh nickel grids . Anti - Vpblp antibodies were diluted 1 : 3 in PBST ( 140 mM NaC1 , 3 mM KC1 , 8 mM Na2HP0 , , 1 . 5 mM KH * PO , , 0 . 05 % Tween 20 ) containing 2 % ovalbumin and were incubated with the cell sections . Gold - conjugated secondary antibodies were diluted as suggested by the manufacturer ( BioCell , Cardiff , UK ) . All incubations were per - formed as described previously ( Preuss et al . , 1991 ) . Screening Xgtll Expression Library - Antibodies specific to Vphlp were used to screen a Clontech Xgtll yeast ( X2180 ) genomic expres - sion library by the method of Huynh et al . ( 1985 ) with the modifica - tions of Manolson et al . ( 1988 ) except that 25 , 000 plaque - forming units were used per 90 - mm plate . A total of 275 , 000 insert - containing plaque - forming units were screened ( approximately 8 yeast genomes worth ) , resulting in four identical positives . Expression of microgram quantities of the Xgtll fusion protein was performed by the method of Mitchell ( 1989 ) . Strains - All strains were derived from X2180 - 1B ( MATa gal2 SUC2 ) or from crosses between isogenic derivatives of the strain and strains congenic to X2180 - 1B obtained from D . Botstein ( Stanford University ) . The relevant genotypes of strains used in this work are listed in Table I . Strains BJ4875 to BJ4878 are segregants from a single tetrad resulting from the mating of BJ4887 to BJ4888 . Strain BJ6716 resulted from the transformation of BJ3131 with the 4 . 25 - kilobase ( kb ) ApaI - BamHI fragment of the plasmid pAvphl : : LEU2 ( see below for details on plasmids ) . Strains BJ6717 to BJ6720 are segregants of one tetrad resulting from the sporulation of BJ6716 . DNA Sequencing - The nucleotide sequence of VPHl was se - quenced to completion on both strands through the following metb - ods : 1 ) constructing a set of exonuclease I11 nested deletions , 2 ) ’ D . Preuss , J . Mulholland , A . Franzusoff , N . Segev , and D . Bot - stein , submitted for publication . subcloning restriction fragments into a sequencing vector , and 3 ) custom synthesizing an oligonucleotide . For the exonuclease 111 nested deletions , the 3 . 6 - kb ClaI - EcoRI fragment of pVIP1 - 78 ( Fig . la ) was cloned into ClaI - EcoRI - digested KS M13 - ( pVIP1 - 82 ) and SK M13 - ( pVIP1 - 83 ) Bluescript vectors ( Stratagene cloning systems ) as shown in Fig . lb . pVIP1 - 82 was linearized with SalI , filled in with thionucleotides to create an exonuclease 111 - resistant end , and then cut again with ClaI . pVIP1 - 83 was linearized with BamHI , filled in with thionucleotides , and cut again with EcoRI . Both plasmids were then subjected to a exonuclease 111 digestion using the Double - Stranded Nested Deletion Kit ( Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology Inc . ) following the manufacturer’s instructions . A series of 15 and 14 subclones were constructed from pVIP1 - 82 and pVIP1 - 83 , respec - tively ; deletion subclones differed successively by approximately 250 bp . To sequence through and past the EcoRI site , the 460 - bp BstYI - ScaI fragment of pVIP1 - 78 was cloned into BamHI - EcoRV - digested Bluescript KS M13 + ( pBSKS101 ) and KS M13 - ( pBSKSlO2 ) as shown in Fig . IC . Single - stranded DNA templates were sequenced by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method of Sanger et al . ( 1977 ) with the SequenaseTM Kit ( United States Biochemical Corp . ) using the T3 or SK primers . Finally , the oligonucleotide 5’ - ACG TTT GCA CTG GGT TG - 3’ ( Fig . 2 , bp 2880 - 2896 ) was synthesized to allow determination of the 3’ end of VPHl via double - stranded sequencing on pVIP1 - 78 . To resolve sequencing compressions , dITP was used instead of dGTP in the nucleotide mixture . Plasmids - The plasmids pVPHlA3 - 1 and pVIP1 - 78 are deriva - tives of YCp50 . pVPHlA3 - 1 contains an 8 . 8 - kb yeast genomic insert that complements the uphl - 1 mutation . pIBEVPHl contains a 6 . 9 - kb BamHI - EagI fragment from the pVPHlA3 - 1 insert ligated into the BamHI - EagI sites of YIp5 . The disruption plasmid pAvphl : : LEU2 was constructed via a trimolecular ligation with the following three restriction fragments . 1 ) A 1 . 8 - kb XbaI - KpnI ( with the XbaI site filled in to form a blunt end ) fragment of the nested deletion subclone pVIP1 - 83 - 10D ( see Fig . Id ) containing a sequence from the ClaI site in pVIP1 - 78 to nucleotide 782 ( using the numbering in Fig . 2 ) . 2 ) A 2 . 2 - kb SalI - XhoI ( with the Sal1 site filled in to form a blunt end ) fragment of YEpl3 containing the entire open reading frame of LEU2 . 3 ) A 3 . 2 - kb KpnI - XhoI fragment of the nested deletion subclone pVIP1 - 82 - 16f ( see Fig . le ) containing the entire Bluescript KS M13 - vector and sequence from the EcoRI site in pVIP1 - 78 to nucleotide 2389 ( using the numbering in Fig . 2 ) . The end result is 5’ VPHl sequence starting at the ClaI site up to nucleotide 782 followed by the coding region of LEU2 ( replacing 64 % of the coding region of VPHI ) followed by 3’ VPHl sequence starting at nucleotide 2389 and ending with the EcoRI site , all of which is inserted into the ClaI - EcoRI sites of the polylinker of KS M13 - ( Fig . If ) . Genetic Methods - Sporulation , dissection , and scoring of nutri - tional markers were performed as described in Hawthorne and Mor - timer ( 1960 ) . The VPHl marker was scored on the basis of the pH - sensitive fluorescence of 6 - carboxyfluorescein as described in Preston et al . ( 1992 ) . DNA Manipulations - Most of the techniques for the preparation and analysis of DNA are detailed in Maniatis et al . ( 1982 ) . Yeast transformations were performed as described in Woolford et al . ( 1990 ) . RESULTS Cloning VPHl - The VPHl gene was cloned twice in our laboratory by two independent methods : firstly by comple - mentation of the vphl - 1 mutation , and secondly by screening a Xgtll expression library with antibodies raised against a 95 - kDa vacuolar integral membrane protein . Cloning through Complementation of the vphl - 1 Mutation - The vphl - 1 mutant BJ4886 was transformed with the yeast genomic library in the low copy plasmid YCp50 ( a gift from M . Rose ( Princeton University ) , J . Thomas ( University of Washington ) , and P . Novick ( Yale University ) ) . Approxi - mately 19 , 000 Ura + transformants were screened for comple - mentation of the uphl - 1 fluorescence phenotypes . For the three colonies that , upon retest , gave plasmid - associated com - plementation , potential plasmid candidates were shuttled through Escherichia coli and retransformed into BJ4886 . Two of the plasmids had overlapping restriction maps . A 6 . 9 - kb BamHI - EagI DNA fragment common to the two inserts was VPHl Encodes a 95 - kDa Yeast Vacuolar H + - ATPase Subunit 14297 subcloned into the integrating vector YIp5 that had been digested with BamHI and EagI , generating the plasmid pIBEVPH1 . This chimeric plasmid was linearized within the 6 . 9 - kb insert with BglII and transformed into BJ4873 ( uphl - 1 ) and BJ4878 ( VPHl ) , selecting for Ura + transformants . Meiotic analysis of the cross between the Ura + transfor - mant of BJ4878 and BJ4879 ( uphl - I ) gave nine tetrads that segregated 2 Ura + Vph + : 2 Ura - Vph - , indicating that the plas - mid had integrated and that linearization within the insert had directed integration to a site close to the VPHl locus . Meiotic analysis of the cross between the Ura + transformant of BJ4873 ( which proved to be of Vph + phenotype ) and BJ2663 ( VPHl ) yielded 18 tetrads that segregated 4 Vph + : O Vph - ( and 2 Ura + : 2 Ura - ) , indicating tight linkage between the site of plasmid integration and the uphl - 1 allele , and that the integrated gene complemented the uphl - 1 allele . From the data for these two crosses , we concluded that we had cloned the VPHl gene . The exceptional tetrads from these crosses , two from the former cross that gave 3 Ura ' Vph + : l Ura - Vph - and one from the latter cross that showed 3 Vph + : l Vph - segregation ( the Vph - segregant was also Ura - ) , are compat - ible with the conclusion . Cloning through a Xgtll Expression Library - Polyclonal antibodies were generated against an abundant 95 - kDa vac - uolar integral membrane protein as described under " Experi - mental Procedures . " The antibodies were affinity - purified and shown to recognize only one polypeptide of the right size and intracellular location ( discussed below ) . A total of 275 , 000 insert - containing plaque - forming units from a yeast genomic Xgtll expression library were screened ( approximately 8 yeast genomes worth ) resulting in four identical positives . The positive clones contained a 3 - kb insert and produced an isopropyl @ - D - thiogalactopyranoside - inducible fusion protein of about 150 kDa that was recognized by the antibodies used for the screen and by anti - @ - galactosidase antibodies ( data not shown ) . To further confirm that the isopropyl @ - D - thio - galactopyranoside - induced protein was in - frame and contig - uous to @ - galactosidase and encoded by a genuine yeast gene , about 300 bp were sequenced starting just before and going through the putative fusion protein ' s EcoRI junction site using the Xgtll forward primer ( New England Biolabs , Catalog No . 1218 ) . Sequencing revealed a continuous open reading frame , in - frame and contiguous to lacZ , with a codon bias in agree - ment with the codon bias for yeast genes ( data not shown ) . The @ - galactosidase portion of the fusion protein accounts for 114 kDa ( Huynh et al . , 1985 ) , implying that the insert only encodes a 36 - kDa polypeptide . To retrieve a full length clone , the Xgtll insert was radioactively labeled and used in colony hybridization to probe E . coli colonies bearing yeast genomic DNA sequences in YCp50 . Several positive clones were cho - sen , which , on the basis of restriction mapping , were found to be completely contained within or overlapping with the largest positive , pVIP1 - 78 . DNA blot hybridization with the radio - actively labeled Xgtll insert as a probe demonstrated that the X g t l l insert was contained within the 3 . 6 - kb ClaI - EcoRI fragment of pVIP1 - 78 ( see Fig . la ) . Similarities were noticed between the restriction maps for DNA encoding VPHl and the Xgtll - selected DNA contained within plasmids pVIP1 - 78 and pVIP1 - 79 . Further restriction analysis was performed on pIBEVPHl and pVIP1 - 78 with the endonucleases EcoRI and EcoRV ; a 1 . 8 - kb EcoRI frag - ment , a 0 . 48 - kb EcoRI - EcoRV fragment , and a 0 . 25 - kb EcoRV fragment were observed by agarose gel electrophoresis in digests from both plasmid inserts . The radiolabeled 1 . 8 - kb EcoRI fragment of the pIBEVPH1 clone proved to hybridize to a 1 . 8 - kb EcoRI fragment band from pIBEVPHl and from c ) pBSKSl01 and pBSKSlO2 I , \ " L - ~ L " - ! - + b ) pVlPl - 82 ' and pVlPl - 83 f , mI I N PI XI - - $ 4 $ 23 I I I I t l l SK - d ) PVlPl - 83 - 1 Od e ) pVIP1 - 82 - 16f 1 VPHl ORF I f ) pAvph7 : : LEUZ FIG . 1 .

We interpreted these data to mean that pVIP1 - 78 and pVIP1 - 79 contain the VPHl gene . Sequence Analysis - The DNA sequence encoding the VPHl gene ( Fig . 2 ) was sequenced to completion on both strands , using the strategy described under " Experimental Procedures " and shown in Fig . 1 , b and c . There is an open reading frame of 2521 bp ( starting at bp 487 and ending with bp 3007 in Fig . 2 ) encoding a putative polypeptide of 840 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of 95 . 6 kDa . The sequence context around the putative ATG start codon is in close agreement with the consensus sequence for highly expressed yeast genes reported by Hamilton et al . ( 1987 ) . Codon usage in the open reading frame of VPHl predominantly matches the codon preference statistics for highly expressed yeast genes published by Sharp et al . ( 1986 ) . Vphlp can be essentially divided into two equal size regions , a hydrophilic amino terminus and a hydrophobic carboxyl terminus containing putative membrane - spanning domains . By using the method of Kyte and Doolittle ( 1982 ) , the calcu - lated grand average of hydropathy value ( GRAVY ) for resi - dues 1 to 406 is - 4 . 18 , for residues 407 to 840 , 3 . 91 ( the average GRAVY score for sequenced soluble proteins is - 0 . 4 with hydrophobic values lying above and hydrophilic scores lying below this score ) . The algorithms of Klein et al . ( 1985 ) , Rao and Argos ( 1986 ) , and Eisenberg et al . ( 1984 ) all predict 6 to 7 membrane - spanning regions in the carboxyl - terminal domain when using the parameters and cutoff points sug - gested in the original papers . The difference in numbers is a result of the algorithms using different minimum and maxi - mum lengths required for a transmembrane region . The pu - tative transmembrane regions have been underlined in Fig . 2 . 14298 VPHl Encodes a 95 - kDa Yeast Vacuolar H + - ATPase Subunit FIG . 2 . Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence of VPHI . Nu - cleotide and translated amino acid se - quences ( entered above in single - letter code ) are numbered to the left and right , respectively . Putative membrane - span - ning regions ( see “Results” for details ) are underlined . The algorithms of both Eisenberg et al . ( 1984 ) and Klein et al . ( 1985 ) predict one membrane - spanning region in the hy - drophilic amino - terminal domain from residues 172 to 192 . The algorithms scored this region right on and just above the cutoff values for predicting a membrane - spanning domain . Thus , the classification of this region as a transmembrane domain is questionable . There are 3 potential N - X - S type asparagine - linked glycosylation sites in the hydrophilic do - main at amino acid residues 113 , 280 , and 324 . Sequence Homologies - Using alignments created by the program BESTFIT ( Genetics Computer Group Sequence Analysis Software Package ) , Vphlp has 54 % identity ( 71 % similarity ) with the yeast gene product Stvlp ( Similar To - VPHl ) , 42 % identity ( 63 . 5 % similarity ) with the 116 - kDa subunit of the rat clathrin - coated vesicle / synaptic vesicle H + - ATPase , and 42 % identity ( 60 % similarity ) with the TJ6 mouse immune suppressor factor . The evolutionary distance between the two mammalian proteins is almost the same as that between the two yeast gene products ( 54 - 55 % identity , 71 - 74 % similarity ) , while each individual yeast gene product has about the same distance to each mammalian protein ( 38 - 42 % identity , 60 - 64 % similarity ) . A multiple sequence align - ment of the four sequences is shown in Fig . 3 . All four sequences have hydrophilic amino - terminal domains and hy - drophobic carboxyl - terminal domains containing 6 - 8 mem - brane - spanning regions . The major differences between them appear to be several large insertions in Stvlp ( in particular residues 155 - 180 and residues 225 - 238 in Stvlp ) and an insertion in the TJ6 mouse immune suppressor factor ( resi - dues 498 - 508 ) . The small 8 - residue homology between the rat 116 - kDa subunit and the human von Willebrand factor noted by Perin et al . ( 1991 ) is almost perfectly conserved among all four sequences ( see Fig . 3 ) with the following consensus sequence GRY I / V I / L LL L / M G . This region is contained within the quadruplicated D3 repeat domain of the human von Willebrand factor ( Venveij et al . , 1986 ) . The 8 homologous residues are poorly conserved among the four repeat domains Dl - D4 in the von Willebrand factor ( 3 out of 8 residues ) , and there is no speculation as to the function of this domain in the literature . Phenotypes Resulting from the uphl - 1 Mutation - A reces - sive nuclear mutation , uphl - 1 , was isolated in a screen for vacuolar acidification - defective mutants using the pH - sensi - tive fluorescence of 6 - carboxyfluorescein ( Preston et al . , 1989 , 1992 ) . The uphl - 1 mutation results in a vacuolar pH of 6 . 9 ( as compared to the wild type pH of 6 . 2 ) and eliminates vacuolar accumulation of the weak base quinacrine ( Preston et al . , 1989 ) . Purified vacuoles ( prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures” ) from strains bearing the uphl - 1 mutation have no detectable ATP - dependent proton - pumping or bafilomycin - sensitive ATPase activity ( data not shown ) . Barely detectable levels of the two peripherally bound nucleo - tide - binding subunits ( 69 - and 60 - kDa subunits ) are found associated with vacuoles from a uphl - 1 strain , yet , at least for the 69 - kDa subunit , are at wild type levels in whole cell extracts from the same strain ( Fig . 4 ) . On the basis of im - munoblotting , there is no detectable Vphlp antigen in whole cell extracts from strains bearing the uphl - 1 mutation . Disruption of the VPHl Gene - The VPHl gene was dis - rupted by transforming the Leu - diploid BJ3131 to Leu + with the 4 . 25 - kb ApaI - BamHI fragment of pAuphl : : LEU2 , in which the LEU2 gene replaces 64 % of the VPHl open reading frame ( described in detail under “Experimental Procedures” and Fig . 1 ) . The resulting heterozygote ( BJ6716 ) was sporu - lated , and 27 tetrads were dissected , all of which had four spore viability and all of which segregated 2 Vph + Leu - : 2 Vph - Leu + . To confirm that the genomic copy of VPHl was replaced with LEU2 , genomic DNA from the parent recipient VPHl Encodes a 95 - kDa Yeast Vacuolar H + - ATPase Subunit 14299 Vphlp maekeeaimaEHaLvQEY i p c S i s r D s a y t ~ ~ l Y Q ~ nolrrsrYraEQBtUXE .

Panel B , whole cell extract from the segregants in panel A were subjected to immunoblot analysis using a 1 : 350 dilution of the affinity - purified anti - Vphlp antibodies . VPHl genotypes for the segregants are shown above both panels . 14300 VPHl Encodes a 95 - kDa Yeast panel b , in which immunoblotting reveals the absence of Vphlp antigen in the Vph - Leu’ segregants . This result also demonstrates the specificity of the antibodies raised against the vacuolar 95 - kDa polypeptide for the gene product of VPHl . Henceforth , the antibodies will be referred to as anti - Vphlp . All segregants bearing the Avphl : : LEU2 allele were viable but acidification - defective , demonstrating that the VPHl gene is essential for vacuolar acidification but not essential for growth or viability . Vphlp Is Localized to the Vacuolar Membrane - The enrich - ment of Vphlp in the vacuolar membrane is evidenced in the immunoblot in Fig . 6 . At a high dilution of anti - Vphlp , Vphlp antigen was just visible in 100 pg of whole cell extract ( Fig . 6 , whole cell extract ) yet was abundant in only 0 . 2 pg of purified vacuoles ( Fig . 6 , uacuoles ) . Furthermore , when intact vacuoles were disrupted through osmotic lysis , the Vphlp antigen remained attached to the vacuolar membranes ( Fig . 6 , uacu - olar membranes ) . The specificity of Vphlp for the vacuolar membranes is evidenced in the immunogold electron micro - graphs shown in Fig . 7 . Vphlp antigen ( as visualized by the gold particles ) is localized specifically over the vacuolar mem - branes . The identity of these membrane - bound organelles as vacuoles was confirmed by the detection of the vacuolar protease carboxypeptidase Y within the lumen by immuno - kDa 4 16 * 94 FIG . 6 . Localization and alkaline Na2C03 extraction of Vphlp . 100 pg of whole cell extracts ( whole cell extract ) , 0 . 2 pg of purified vacuoles ( vacuoles ) , 0 . 2 pg of vacuolar membranes ( vacuolar membranes ) , 20 pg of protein extracted from the vacuolar membrane by treatment with alkaline Na2C03 ( Na2COR - soluble ) , and 0 . 2 pg of vacuolar membrane proteins not extracted by the alkaline Na2C03 ( NanC03 - insoluble ) were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures” and subject to immunoblot analysis with a 1 : lOOO dilu - tion of the affinity - purified anti - Vphlp antibodies . Vacuolar H + - ATPase Subunit gold electron microscopy ( data not shown ) . Vphlp Is an Integral Membrane Protein - Vacuolar vesicles were treated with Na2C03 , pH 11 . 0 , exactly as described by Woolford et al . ( 1990 ) , after which the membranes were pelleted at 100 , 000 X g . This treatment has been shown to effectively remove the peripherally bound yeast vacuolar pro - teins encoded by PEP5 ( Woolford et al . , 1990 ) and PEP3 ( Preston et al . , 1991 ) from the vacuolar membrane . In Fig . 6 , no Vphlp antigen is detected in the lane containing the Na2C03 - soluble proteins ( Na2COs - soluble ) ; all of the signal is recovered in the lane containing the pelleted membranes ( NapC03 - insoluble ) . Vphlp Is a Vacuolar H + - ATPase Subunit - Both the phe - notype of strains bearing the vphl mutations and the homol - ogy of Vphlp with the rat 116 - kDa clathrin - coated H + - ATP - ase subunit suggest that the VPHl gene encodes a subunit of the yeast vacuolar H + - ATPase . To confirm this possibility , the vacuolar H + - ATPase was partially purified through solu - bilization of vacuolar membranes with the detergent ZW3 - 14 and ultracentrifugation through a glycerol gradient ( as de - scribed under “Experimental Procedures” ) . Fractions with - drawn from the glycerol gradient were assayed for protein content , bafilomycin A , - sensitive ATPase activity , and the Vphlp antigen . Fig . 8 is an immunoblot of the resulting fractions probed with anti - Vphlp antibodies ; the specific ac - tivity of bafilomycin A1 - sensitive ATP hydrolysis is reported under the corresponding fraction . The Vphlp antigen is seen enriching and co - purifying with the peak of ATPase activity ( Fig . 8 , fraction 8 ) . DISCUSSION VPHl Encodes a Vacuolar H + - ATPase Subunit - Here we present genetic , biochemical , and sequence data that a 95 - kDa polypeptide , encoded by the VPHl gene , is a subunit of the vacuolar ATPase and is required for its in uiuo assembly and enzyme activity . Mutations , including a deletion , of the VPHl gene result in an acidification - defective vacuole ( Pres - ton et al . , 1989 ) , mislocalization of the peripherally bound H + - ATPase nucleotide - binding subunits ( Fig . 4 ) , and absence of any detectable bafilomycin AI - sensitive ATP hydrolysis or ATP - dependent proton - pumping in purified vacuoles . Bio - chemically , Vphlp was shown to be highly enriched ( Fig . 6 ) and specifically localized ( Fig . 7 ) to the vacuolar membrane FIG . 7 . Localization of Vphlp through immunogold electron mi - croscopy . Thin sections of whole yeast cells were prepared , probed with a 1 : 3 dilution of affinity - purified anti - Vphlp antibodies , and subjected to immunogold electron microscopy as described under “Experimental Procedures . ” Vacuoles are identified in the micrographs by a V .

Co - purification of Vphlp with the vacuolar H + - ATPase . 1 . 5 mg of vacuolar membranes were solubilized with the detergent ZW3 - 14 , layered on a 20 - 50 % glycerol gradient , and sub - jected to ultracentrifugation as described under “Experimental Pro - cedures . ” 0 . 6 - ml fractions were collected and assayed for bafilomycin A , - sensitive ATP hydrclysis and subjected to SDS - PAGE followed by immunodetection with a 1 : 4000 dilution of affinity - purified anti - Vphlp antibodies . Lunes 1 ( Top ( 20 % glycerol ) ) to 21 ( Bottom ( 50 % glycerol ) ) contain 1 . 0 pg of protein from consecutive fractions off the gradient . The numbers under the lanes represent the specific activity of bafilomycin - sensitive ATP hydrolysis for the corresponding frac - tion . Lanes without numbers on the bottom had no detectable ATPase activity . and to co - purify with the vacuolar H + - ATPase enzyme on a glycerol gradient ( Fig . 8 ) . Furthermore , the deduced amino acid sequence of VPHl has extensive homology to the 116 - kDa subunit of the clathrin - coated vesicle / synaptic vesicle H + - ATPase ( Fig . 3 ) and has approximately the same molec - ular mass as the 100 - kDa subunit reported by Kane et al . ( 1989 ) . The difference between the 95 - kDa subunit calculated in this report and the 100 - kDa subunit calculated by Kane et u1 . ( 1989 ) reflects the difference in molecular mass reported in different molecular size marker kits for phosphorylase b ( 94 kDa uersus 97 . 4 kDa ) , rather than any difference or strain variation in the VPHl gene product . Cloning the VPHl Gene - The VPHl gene was cloned by two independent methods : firstly , through complementation of an acidification - defective mutant using 6 - carboxyfluores - cein diacetate , and , secondly , through a reverse genetic ap - proach of screening expression libraries with antibodies raised against specific vacuolar proteins . Although different in ap - proach , both strategies were designed with the same goal of identifying yeast genes involved in vacuolar biogenesis and function . That two such different methods converged on a gene essential for normal vacuolar function validates both approaches as viable ways of dissecting vacuolar function . Comparison of restriction maps first suggested that the same gene had been cloned twice . This was confirmed through DNA blot hybridization and finally by showing that the Vph - phenotype of uphl mutant strains could be complemented by the plasmid pVIP1 - 78 . Immunoblot analysis of whole cell extracts from strains bearing the Auphl : : LEU2 allele ( Fig . 5 ) show that the antibodies raised to the 95 - kDa protein are indeed specific for and a valid reagent to study the VPHl gene product . Sequence Analysis uersus Biochemical Data - Computer analysis on the nucleic and deduced amino acid sequence of VPHl agrees with the biochemical observations of Vphlp . On the basis of Coomassie Blue staining of polyacrylamide gels , Vphlp is visually the most abundant integral vacuolar membrane protein . This observation is in agreement with the codon usage analysis of the VPHl open reading frame which suggests that the VPHl gene is highly expressed . The VPHl open reading frame encodes an 840 - amino acid polypeptide with a predicted molecular mass of 95 . 6 kDa , almost identical with the 95 kDa calculated for Vphlp on the basis of migration on polyacrylamide gels . The inability of alkaline Na2C03 to strip Vphlp from the vacuolar membrane ( Fig . 5 ) correlates with the 6 predicted transmembrane regions in the carboxyl - terminal domain ( Fig . 2 ) in classifying the VPHl gene product as an integral membrane protein . This agrees with the results of similar experiments performed by Adachi et al . ( 1990 ) and Kane et al . ( 1992 ) and by the labeling of the 100 - kDa subunit of the coated vesicle proton pump by the hydrophobic reagent 3 - ( trifluoromethyl ) - 3 - ( m - iodophenyl ) diazirine ( Arai et al . , 1988 ) . Homologies - The multiple sequence alignment in Fig . 3 demonstrates the extensive homology over the entire lengths of the following : 1 ) the 95 - kDa subunit of the yeast vacuolar H + - ATPase , Vphlp , 2 ) the yeast gene product of STV1 , 3 ) the 116 - kDa subunit of the clathrin - coated vesicle / synaptic vesicle proton pump , 4 ) the TJ6 mouse immune suppressor factor . The similarity of their primary sequences is also re - flected in predicted secondary structure . All four sequences have the same bipartite structure with a hydrophilic amino - terminal and a hydrophobic carboxyl - terminal region contain - ing the membrane - spanning domains . The extent of similarity suggests that all four proteins are functional homologues , performing the same , as yet unknown , function in their re - spective V - type H + - ATPase . The homology between the yeast Vphlp and the mamma - lian 116 - kDa clathrin - coated vesicle / synaptic vesicle H + - ATPase concurs with the current hypothesis that vacuolar H + - ATPases form a separate class of proton pumping en - zymes with a common evolutionary origin ( Gogarten et al . , 1989 ) . The similarity between the DCCD - binding proteolipids and the peripherally bound nucleotide - binding subunits of the V - type ( 17 , 60 , and 69 kDa ) compared to the F , Fo ( 8 kDa , a and p ) H + - ATPases suggest a common evolutionary origin between these two classes of enzymes . The absence of any Vphlp - like subunit ( either in size or sequence homology ) described for the FIFO H + - ATPase implies an early evolution - ary split between the FIFo and vacuolar H + - ATPases . The homology to the TJ6 mouse immune suppressor factor suggests that this factor is a mammalian vacuolar - type H + - ATPase subunit . The TJ6 mouse immune suppressor factor was cloned by screening a mouse Xgtll expression library with antibodies directed against secreted immune regulatory proteins ( Lee et al . , 1990 ) . Lee et al . ( 1990 ) suggest that the first 20 amino - terminal amino acids of the TJ6 sequence are hydrophobic and characteristic of a signal peptide . We are unable to detect any evidence of an amino - terminal secretory signal sequence using the algorithm of Heijne ( 1986 ) in any of the sequences listed in Fig . 3 . The significance of selecting a membrane - bound ATPase subunit with antibodies against secreted immune regulatory proteins or in vitro immune suppression by TJ6 is as yet unknown . Sequence homology has identified a yeast gene product - Similar T o ! PHI , STVl . The existence of the STVl gene could be explained as follows . 1 ) STVl may be a pseudogene , an unlikely possibility since pseudogenes in yeast are rare . Furthermore , there are regions of conserved predicted peptide sequence between VPHl and STVl that are not conserved at the nucleotide level , implying that there has been selection to maintain the peptide but not the nucleic acid sequence ( data not shown ) . 2 ) STVl and VPHl are duplicated genes that encode functionally interchangeable proteins . This too seems unlikely as most functionally interchangeable proteins en - coded by duplicated genes in yeast ( a - tubulin , ribosomal proteins , elongation factor la , histones , ubiquitin ) are greater than 90 % identical , most with only a few amino acid changes . 14302 VPHl Encodes a 95 - kDa Yeast Stvlp and Vphlp are only 54 % identical with long non - homologous insertions in Stvlp ( Fig . 3 ) . 3 ) Stvlp and Vphlp may be differentially expressed subunits of the same vacuolar H ' - ATPase enzyme , the differences between the two polypep - tides conferring alternative regulation once assembled into an enzyme . This scenario has been suggested for the 72 % ho - mologous y subunits ( atpC1 and atpC2 ) of the Arabidopsis thaliana chloroplast FIFO ATPase by Inohara et al . ( 1991 ) . Although the 80 % identical Schizosaccharomyces pombe plasma membrane H + - ATPases , PMAl and PMA2 , are func - tionally interchangeable , Ghislain and Goffeau ( 1991 ) present evidence that the 20 % difference between two H + - ATPases confers differences in phosphorylation and thus regulation of the enzymes . 4 ) Stvlp and Vphlp are equivalent subunits for specific V - type H + - ATPases located on different endomem - brane organelles , the divergent domains between Stvlp and Vphlp being responsible for the differential targeting and regulation of the enzyme for a specific organelle . Yeast has several endomembrane organelles that require transmem - brane electrochemical gradients for their specific functions ( vacuole , clathrin - coated vesicles , peroxisomes , and Golgi complex ) and thus one expects there to exist unique V - ATPases bound to different endomembrane organelles . These V - type ATPases must be targeted and assembled on different membranes and must be differentially regulated according to the needs of the organelle . Lai et al . ( 1991 ) have found that , at least in higher plants , the 17 - kDa proteolipid subunit is encoded by a small multigene family and suggest that multiple genes provide isoforms for organelle - specific V - ATPases . To address the in vivo function of Stvlp , we are studying the effect of overexpressing and disrupting the STVl gene , at - tempting to localize the gene product , and we are searching for additional STVgenes . This work , together with the details of cloning and sequencing of STVl , will be published in a subsequent report . Role of the 95 - kDa Subunit - There is evidence to suggest that the 95 - kDa subunit of vacuolar H ' - ATPases may be involved in assembly rather than the catalysis reaction of the enzyme . Xie and Stone ( 1988 ) have shown that both the membrane - bound 116 - and 16 - kDa subunits of the clathrin - coated vesicle H ' - ATPase are dispensable for Ca2 + - activated ATP hydrolysis but not for MP - activated ATP hydrolysis or proton pumping . Radiation inactivation analysis of vacu - olar H + - ATPases consistently predicts functional molecular masses that are smaller than one would predict by the addition of the molecular masses of associated subunits ( Sarafian et al . , 1992 ) . In S . cereuisiae specifically , the functional molecular mass for DCCD - sensitive multiple - cycle ATP hydrolysis was calculated by radiation inactivation to be between 410 and 530 kDa ( Hirata et al . , 1989 ) . Addition of the associated S . cereuisiae H + - ATPase subunits reported by Kane et al . ( 1989 ) using the subunit stoichiometry suggested by Arai et al . ( 1988 ) calculates a molecular mass of 721 kDa ( 95 kDa , 3 X 69 kDa , 3 X 60 kDa , 42 kDa , 36 kDa , 32 kDa , 27 kDa , 6 X 17 kDa ) . The difference between functional and total molecular mass implies that not all the associated V - type ATPase subunits are involved in the hydrolysis of ATP or translocation of protons . Kane et al . ( 1992 ) show that in the absence of either the 69 - or 60 - kDa nucleotide - binding subunits , the 95 - kDa sub - unit is still correctly and stably inserted into the vacuolar membrane as long as the membrane - bound 17 - kDa subunit is present . In the absence of the membrane - bound 95 - kDa sub - unit , the peripherally bound nucleotide - binding subunits ( 69 and 60 kDa ) are no longer correctly targeted to the vacuolar membrane ( Fig . 4 ) . These results suggest that the 95 - and 17 - Vacuolar H + - ATPase Subunit kDa subunits are epistatic to the 69 - and 60 - kDa subunits for vacuolar H + - ATPase assembly . Here we have shown that the 95 - kDa subunit of vacuolar H ' - ATPases is required for as - sembly and hypothesize that it is necessary for targeting of the enzymes to specific organelles .
