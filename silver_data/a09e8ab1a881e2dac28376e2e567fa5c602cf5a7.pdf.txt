Cortactin plays a key role in 28 stabilizing actin filament branches by interacting with the Arp2 / 3 complex and 29 actin filaments via its N - terminal Acidic domain ( NtA ) and 6 . 5 central 30 unstructured 37 amino acid repeats , respectively 1 , but the mechanism of this 31 is unclear . We determined the structure of cortactin - stabilized Arp2 / 3 actin 32 branches using cryo - electron microscopy . We find that cortactin interacts with 33 the new daughter filament nucleated by the Arp2 / 3 complex at the branch site 34 rather than the initial mother actin filament . Cortactin preferentially binds 35 activated Arp3 in contrast to other nucleation promoting factors ( NPFs ) 2 , 3 . 36 Cortactin also stabilizes the F - actin - like interface of activated Arp3 with the first 37 actin subunit of the new filament , and its central repeats extend along 38 successive daughter filament subunits . Cortactin binding to Arp3 is 39 incompatible with NPF interaction and its preference for activated Arp3 explains 40 why it is retained at the actin branch . Our data have uncovered why cortactin 41 displaces NPFs , while at the same time promoting synergy to regulate branched 42 actin network dynamics . 43 3 The actin cytoskeleton can form many different types of dynamic supramolecular 44 arrays - from linear bundles to branched actin filament networks which underlie its 45 functional diversity and adaptability 4 - 9 . Distinct F - actin arrays are formed by the 46 localized activities of specific actin nucleating factors , actin binding proteins and 47 myosin motors 4 , 5 , 10 . For example , branched actin networks are generated when a new 48 “daughter” filament is nucleated from the side of a pre - existing “mother” filament by 49 the Arp2 / 3 complex 5 , 11 , 12 . Branch formation requires activation of the seven subunit 50 Arp2 / 3 complex which involves a conformational rearrangement of the complex so that 51 a short - pitch helical F - actin - like template is formed by the Actin related proteins Arp2 52 and Arp3 from which the fast growing barbed end of the daughter filament extends 53 13 , 14 . Class 1 nucleation promoting factors ( NPFs ) such as WAVE and WASP activate 54 Arp2 / 3 via a conserved C - terminal VCA domain , consisting of one to three V erprolin 55 domains ( also known as WASP - homology 2 domains ) followed by C entral and A cidic 56 segments 2 , 3 , 15 - 21 . The VCA domain of Class 1 NPFs also stimulate nucleation by 57 recruiting actin subunits to the activated Arp2 / 3 complex , from which these NPFs are 58 subsequently released ( Extended Data Fig . 1a ) 22 - 24 . The correct functioning of Arp2 / 3 - 59 nucleated branched actin networks depends not only on their spatial and temporal 60 assembly but also their stability and turnover 25 - 29 . The actin binding protein cortactin , 61 a Class 2 NPF , plays a major role in stabilizing actin branches by interacting with the 62 Arp2 / 3 complex and F - actin ( Fig . 1a ) 30 - 33 . Furthermore , although cortactin by itself 63 can weakly activate the Arp2 / 3 complex , it synergizes with Class 1 NPFs to further 64 stimulate efficient Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin branch formation 22 , 23 , 34 . Given its central role 65 in stabilizing branched actin networks , cortactin is important in many cellular 66 processes such as epithelial integrity and intracellular trafficking as well as a range of 67 pathologies including bacterial infection and cancer metastasis 1 , 35 - 37 . However , 68 despite its functional importance , the precise mode of action of cortactin and its 69 mechanism of synergy with Class 1 NPFs remains unknown . 70 71 We determined the structure of in vitro reconstituted cortactin - stabilized Arp2 / 3 actin 72 branches using cryo - electron microscopy ( cryo - EM ) and single particle reconstruction 73 at ~ 3 . 3 Å resolution ( Fig . 1 b , Extended Data Fig . 1 , 2 , Extended Data Table 1 , Movie 74 1 ) . To maximize the number of branches in our sample and therefore the possibility of 75 visualizing the previously elusive binding site of cortactin , we used the most active 76 isoform of human Arp2 / 3 ( Arp2 / 3 - C1B - C5L 33 ) , and also included capping protein in 77 4 our sample to limit daughter filament growth 38 - 41 . The resulting branch structure 78 allowed us to visualize cortactin ( Extended Data Fig . 2 , 3 ) and showed that 79 unexpectedly , cortactin connects the activated Arp2 / 3 complex and the daughter 80 filament , in contrast to previous proposals that cortactin binds to the mother filament 81 ( Fig . 1 b ) 23 , 34 . In the presence of cortactin , the overall conformation of the activated 82 Arp2 / 3 complex at the junction of mother and daughter filaments is similar to previous 83 cryo - EM structures 13 , 42 , 43 ( Extended Data Fig . 4a , b , Movie 1 ) . The daughter filament 84 consists of 4 subunits ( DA1 - DA4 ) , each with ADP bound , and its barbed end is 85 terminated by capping protein 38 - 41 . The cortactin density that extends along this short 86 daughter filament corresponds to the first cortactin repeat ( Fig . 1b ) . No density 87 corresponding to cortactin is observed on the ADP - bound mother filament ( consisting 88 of MA1 – MA6 in our image processing scheme , Extended Data Fig . 2 ) . Both mother 89 and daughter filaments adopt canonical ADP - F - actin structures 44 , 45 and Arp2 and 90 Arp3 are also bound to ADP ( Extended Data Fig . 4b - d ) . Overall , our structure shows 91 that rather than modifying the filaments at actin branches , cortactin branch 92 stabilization is mediated by the protein - protein contacts that cortactin forms with the 93 activated Arp2 / 3 complex and the daughter filament 30 - 32 . 94 95 Cortactin NtA domain residues 21 - 79 form electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions 96 with all four Arp3 subdomains , as well as contacting ArpC2 ( Fig . 2a , Extended Data 97 Fig . 5a - d ) . The cortactin DWE motif ( residues 21 – 23 ) that is essential for the 98 interaction with Arp2 / 3 31 inserts into a positively charged pocket of Arp3 , while 99 residues 24 – 54 adopt a meandering trajectory across the Arp3 surface ( Fig . 2 a , b , 100 Extended Data Fig . 5 ) . At residue 55 , the NtA domain turns ~ 90° on the surface of 101 Arp3 and forms an amphipathic a - helix ( residues I55 – T76 ) which binds in a 102 hydrophobic cleft on Arp3 and points towards the daughter filament ( Fig . 2a , c ) . This 103 cortactin helix binds adjacent to the Arp3 hinge helix ( residues 145 – 154 ) which is key 104 in mediating inactive - active Arp2 / 3 complex structural transitions 13 , 14 , 43 . 105 106 The cortactin NtA a - helix stabilizes the Arp3 W - loop ( residues 180 – 187 ) in a 107 conformation that has been previously observed only in activated Arp2 / 3 and is distinct 108 from that seen in the inactivated Arp2 / 3 complex 3 , 13 , 46 , 47 . As a result , the structural 109 groove at the barbed end of Arp3 is open and promotes the interaction with DA1 of 110 5 the new daughter filament ( Fig . 2d ) . The contacts formed between activated Arp3 and 111 DA1 mimic the longitudinal contacts along F - actin 13 , 14 and involve insertion of 112 subdomain 2 of DA1 - specifically its so - called D - loop - in the barbed - end of Arp3 ( Fig . 113 2d ) . Further , the loop within Arp3 ( residues 155 - 164 ) that follows the hinge helix - 114 which we now term the cortactin loop - makes contacts with the cortactin NtA a - helix 115 via a distinct conformation compared to branch structures in the absence of cortactin 116 ( Fig . 2e ) . The structure is consistent with a model in which the interaction of the 117 cortactin NtA domain with activated Arp2 / 3 complex also stabilizes the interface of 118 Arp3 with DA1 of the daughter filament . 119 120 The first cortactin central repeat ( residues 80 - 116 ) extends ~ 5 . 5 nm from the C - 121 terminus of the NtA a - helix longitudinally on the daughter filament to connect the two 122 successive subunits DA1 and DA3 ( Fig . 3a ) . D116 , the final residue of the first 123 cortactin central repeat , is positioned on DA3 in an equivalent position to the first 124 repeat residue ( A80 ) on DA1 ( Fig . 3a ) . Based on the cortactin F - actin interaction in 125 our structure , we modelled how the cortactin central repeats would interact with a 126 longer daughter filament . Our model shows that the second repeat would bind along 127 the daughter filament in the same way as the first repeat to connect DA3 and DA5 128 ( Fig . 3b ) . Furthermore , it predicts that the cortactin repeats , including the C - terminal 129 half repeat , would extend to the barbed end of DA13 , a half - turn of the F - actin helix 130 ( Fig . 3c , Movie 2 ) . The conservation of interacting residues within the cortactin repeats 131 is also consistent with the repeating pattern of interactions with the hydrophobic and 132 hydrophilic regions of the F - actin surface ( Fig . 3d ) . Given the conserved amino acid 133 distribution between all 6 . 5 repeats and the observed binding pattern of the first central 134 repeat , it is likely that cortactin repeats act together to maximize branch stability . Our 135 model shows how lysine acetylation in cortactin central repeats would reduce cortactin 136 F - actin binding activity and thereby impede cell motility 48 . The observation that 137 cortactin binds exclusively along the daughter filament now also explains why cortactin 138 stabilizes linear actin filaments nucleated by SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 complexes in the 139 absence of a mother filament 49 . 140 141 Our data show that the daughter filament is stabilized directly by the cortactin repeats 142 binding along intra - strand subunits of the daughter filament ( Fig . 4a ) . In addition , they 143 6 also reveal that the NtA indirectly stabilizes the branch by forming extensive 144 interactions with activated Arp3 to promote DA1 D - loop insertion ( Fig . 2a , Extended 145 Data Fig . 5 ) . The interactions of cortactin NtA and Arp3 are specific to its activated 146 conformation as computational docking of our NtA structure onto the inactive Arp3 147 conformation generates structural clashes ( Fig . 2a , Extended Data Fig . 5e ) . To assess 148 the idea that NtA alone can stabilize actin branches because of its preference for 149 activated Arp3 , we tested the ability of cortactin NtA to maintain branches in an in vitro 150 debranching assay ( Fig . 4b , Extended Data Fig . 6 ) . NtA does provide protection from 151 debranching compared to the actin - only control . However , it was less effective than 152 the full - length cortactin , consistent with the notion that central repeat binding 153 maximizes branch stabilization . 154 155 Our observation that cortactin stabilizes activated Arp3 contrasts with VCA - containing 156 class 1 NPFs and has implications for the coordinated regulation of actin branches . 157 Our structure shows how binding of cortactin NtA to Arp3 would sterically block VCA 158 binding sites - particularly of its C - helix - to compete for Arp3 binding ( Fig . 4c , d ) . VCA 159 binding to Arp3 has only been observed on the inactive complex 2 , 3 , it does not readily 160 associate with activated Arp3 in MD simulations 50 , and VCA binding would clash with 161 the D - loops of incoming DA1 and DA2 13 . Consistent with a preference for inactivated 162 Arp2 / 3 , N - WASP - CA promotes branch destabilization in our debranching assay 49 163 ( Fig . 4b , Extended Data Fig . 6 ) . The overlapping binding sites of cortactin NtA helix 164 and VCA helix are centred at the junction of Arp3 subdomains 1 and 3 ; the relative 165 position of these subdomains alters on Arp2 / 3 activation , and each protein is sensitive 166 to these changes ( Fig . 4d ) . Further , the preferential binding of VCA and cortactin to 167 inactive and activated Arp3 respectively provides a mechanistic basis for displacement 168 models of the synergistic activation of Arp2 / 3 by VCA and cortactin . VCA release from 169 nascent actin branches is a necessary and rate - limiting step for branch formation and 170 is accelerated by cortactin 22 - 24 . Our structure shows that cortactin displaces the NPF 171 CA domain , both by competition and because the activated Arp3 conformation favours 172 NtA binding . The previously reported synergy of class 1 NPF VCA domains and 173 cortactin at Arp2 / 3 branches therefore arises from VCA binding to and activating 174 Arp2 / 3 followed by NtA accelerating VCA release and stabilizing the Arp2 / 3 activated 175 state 22 , 23 , 34 . Further , the observation that cortactin alone is only a weak activator of 176 Arp2 / 3 nucleation has been puzzling and was thought to be because of its inability to 177 7 recruit actin monomers to the nascent branch , unlike Class 1 NPFs 32 , 51 . Our structure 178 now shows that this weak stimulation of Arp2 / 3 nucleation is also because of the 179 preference of the cortactin NtA for activated Arp3 . 180 181 Our data reveal exactly how cortactin supports Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin branches by 182 binding and stabilizing the active conformation of Arp3 and the longitudinal subunit 183 interactions along the daughter filament . It is also striking that our structure - based 184 model reveals that the interaction mode of the 6 . 5 cortactin central repeats correspond 185 precisely to a half - turn of the F - actin helix . In contrast , the haemopoietic specific 186 cortactin paralogue , HS1 , only has 3 . 5 repeats and would be predicted only to interact 187 with DA1 , DA3 , DA5 and DA7 , consistent with its lower affinity for F - actin 52 . This 188 indicates how the regulated expression of cortactin and its relatives in different tissues 189 could tune the local dynamics of branched actin networks . Within the Arp2 / 3 complex , 190 Arp3 not only forms the structural template for the nucleated daughter filament , but its 191 conformation favours binding partners such as cortactin , and may also communicate 192 to other cytoskeleton regulators such as the de - branching factor coronin that the 193 complex is activated 33 . Since actin branch turnover is critical for normal functioning of 194 the actin cytoskeleton , our visualization of cortactin has important implications for how 195 it protects against de - branching by coronin , whether via competition for Arp2 / 3 196 binding , protection of the daughter filament junction or both 28 , 33 , 53 - 55 . This in turn could 197 determine whether Arp2 / 3 complexes remain bound to mother filaments following de - 198 branching and are thus available for further rounds of nucleation . Our discovery of an 199 a - helix in the cortactin NtA and characterisation of its binding site at the junction of 200 Arp3 subdomains 1 and 3 highlights the equivalence of this binding site to the binding 201 cleft on actin where a large number of actin binding proteins interact and which also 202 mediates longitudinal contacts in F - actin 44 , 45 , 56 . This emphasizes the conserved 203 nature of the conformational changes that both Arp3 and actin undergo during actin 204 nucleation and polymerization , and the importance of this hotspot in both proteins for 205 binding regulators . 206 207 Acknowledgements 208 This project has received funding from the European Research Council ( ERC ) under 209 the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme ( grant 210 8 agreement No 810207 to M .

Cortactin NtA ( 1 - 77 ) was purified following the 229 same method as full - length cortactin . Human Arp2 / 3 complex containing ArpC1B / C5L 230 isoforms ( UniProt P61160 , P61158 , O15143 , O15144 , O15145 , P59998 , Q9BPX5 ) 231 was purified following the protocol described by Baldauf et al 57 . 232 233 Mouse capping protein α1β2 ( UniProt P47753 and P47757 - 2 ) were co - expressed in 234 BL21 Star TM DE3 cells using a pRSFDuet - 1 plasmid with N - terminal 6 * His tag fused 235 to the α1 subunit . Cells were grown at 37 ° C and protein expression was induced with 236 20 μM IPTG when OD reached 1 . 1 . After adding IPTG , the cells were grown overnight 237 at 16 ° C . The next day , cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5 , 000 g for 15 mins , 238 resuspended and lysed using a high - pressure homogeniser ( Avesti Emusiflex C3 ) in 239 lysis buffer ( 50 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 138 mM NaCl , 2 . 7 mM KCl with EDTA - free protease 240 inhibitor ( Roche ) ) . The cell lysate was centrifuged at 49 , 500 × g for 30 mins to remove 241 cell debris . The supernatant was transferred to a column with Ni - NTA Resin ( Merck ) 242 and incubated for 1 hour at 4 ° C . The column was washed with lysis buffer and His - 243 tagged capping protein dimer was eluted from the column in elution buffer ( 50 mM Tris 244 pH 8 . 0 , 138 mM NaCl , 2 . 7 mM KCl with 250mM Imidazole ) . The eluted proteins were 245 concentrated to 0 . 5ml using Amicon Ultra - 4 ml Centrifugal Filters ( Millipore ) and 246 loaded onto a gel filtration column ( Superdex 200 Increase 10 / 300 GL , GE Healthcare ) 247 on an ÅKTA system ( GE Healthcare ) . The peak fractions containing capping protein 248 were collected and buffer exchanged into a low - salt buffer ( 10 mM Tris pH 7 . 5 , 10 mM 249 KCl and 1mM DTT ) . Finally , the proteins were loaded onto a 1ml HiTrap Q HP column 250 ( GE Healthcare ) . Capping protein heterodimers were separated from other minor 251 protein contaminants by linear gradient elution . The linear gradient was generated by 252 combining high - salt buffer ( 10 mM Tris pH 7 . 5 , 400 mM KCl and 1mM DTT ) with low 253 salt buffer ( 10 mM Tris pH 7 . 5 , 10 mM KCl and 1mM DTT ) . β / γ non - muscle actin from 254 purified porcine brain was purchased from Hypermol ( Cat 8401 - 01 ) and reconstituted 255 10 with 200 µl ultrapure water to obtain a 1 mg / ml solution in a buffer with 2 mM Tris - HCl 256 pH 8 . 2 , 2 . 0 mM ATP , 0 . 5 mM DTT , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 , 1mM NaN 3 and 0 . 2 % disaccharides . 257 258 Cryo - EM sample preparation 259 Branch reconstitution conditions were adapted from those used to reconstitute 260 Schizosaccharomyces pombe Arp2 / 3 complex - bound actin filaments 14 . Protein 261 concentrations were optimized to enhance short actin branch formation and minimize 262 the preferred orientation problem caused by the “Y” - shape of actin branches on the 263 cryo - EM grid : 1 ) actin concentration was kept low to prevent spontaneous nucleation 264 and limit filament growth ; 2 ) a high concentration of capping protein was added to limit 265 daughter filament growth . First , 1 . 7 μM Arp2 / 3 , 1 . 7μM VCA , 16 . 1 μM SPIN90 , 0 . 8 μM 266 actin and 3 . 2 μM capping protein were mixed in 14 . 9 μl buffer containing 20 mM 267 HEPES pH 7 . 5 , 50 mM KCl , 1 mM EGTA , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM ATP and 1 mM DTT 268 and incubated at room temperature for 20 mins . Then , 4 . 5 ul of 23 . 8 μM actin was 269 added in 9 separate additions that were together incubated at room temperature for 270 20 mins . 1 . 2 μl of 80 μM capping protein was added in 2 separate additions with the 271 3 rd and 7 th addition of actin . After the final addition of actin , 1 . 7 μM cortactin was added 272 followed by another 20 min incubation . Finally , 10 μM phalloidin ( Invitrogen™ ) was 273 added to stabilize the actin branches . 274 275 Following incubation , 4 μl of the final reconstitution mix was applied to a glow - 276 discharged C - flat 1 . 2 / 1 . 3 grid . The grid was plunge frozen using EM GP2 Automatic 277 Plunge Freezer ( Leica ) with the following settings : sensor blotting , back blotting , 278 additional movement of 0 . 3 mm , blotting time of 5 s , humidity of 98 % , and temperature 279 of 22 ° C . 280 281 Cryo - EM data acquisition 282 Cryo - EM data ( 12 , 073 movies ) were collected on a Titan Krios microscope ( Thermo 283 Fisher Scientific ) operated at an accelerating voltage of 300 kV with a nominal 284 magnification of 81K and pixel size of 1 . 067 Å . The data were collected with a K3 285 detector operating in super - resolution mode ( bin2 ) with a BioQuantum energy filter 286 ( Gatan ) . 50 frames for each micrograph were collected using EPU software with 14 . 8 287 11 e - / pixel / s dose rate , 3 . 8 s exposure time , 49 . 4 e - / Å 2 total electron exposure dose and 288 a defocus range from - 0 . 9 to - 2 . 4 μm . 289 290 Cryo - EM data processing 291 Cryo - EM data were processed using CryoSPARC v3 58 . Movies were motion - 292 corrected using Patch motion . Contrast Transfer Function ( CTF ) parameters were 293 estimated using Patch CTF . 8518 micrographs with CTF fit resolution < 6 . 4 Å and total 294 full - frame motion distance < 50 pixels were selected for further data processing . Blob 295 picker with a minimum diameter of 150 Å and a maximum diameter of 200 Å was used 296 for particle picking followed by particle extraction with a box size of 368 pixels and 297 binning factor of 4 . 2 , 001 , 580 extracted particles were subjected to multiple rounds of 298 2D classification to remove contaminants , carbon and non - branched portions of actin 299 filaments . Class averages featuring various views of actin branch junction were 300 selected as templates for template picking . 3 , 247 , 396 template - picked particles were 301 subjected to multiple rounds of 2D classification . The particle sets selected from the 302 blob picker ( 167 , 590 particles ) and template picker ( 244 , 162 particles ) were subjected 303 to ab - initio reconstruction with 2 classes respectively . After ab - initio reconstruction , 304 un - binned particles from these classes were re - extracted with box size of 440 and 305 each were subjected to Homogeneous refinement with the best branch - like ab - initio 306 volume as the initial model . After homogeneous refinements and duplicate removal , 307 the two stacks of particles were combined . The combined 179 , 923 particles were then 308 subjected to a first Non - Uniform ( NU ) - refinement followed by Heterogeneous 309 refinement with 3 classes to further classify particles . Class 1 volume exhibits 310 additional density on one side of the mother filament , and these particles were 311 discarded . The remaining 130 , 915 particles from class 2 and class 3 were combined 312 and subjected to a second NU refinement . Because all 3 classes are different only on 313 the mother filament region , we referred to the first NU - refinement reconstruction 314 before heterogeneous refinement as the Arp2 / 3 - daughter filament consensus map . 315 The second NU - refinement reconstruction was referred to as the mother filament 316 consensus map ( Extended Data Fig . 2 ) . 317 318 Local refinement with a mask around the mother filament on the mother filament 319 consensus map was used to improve the mother filament density . Likewise , the 320 Arp2 / 3 - daughter filament consensus map was divided into three overlapping 321 12 segments ( the Arp2 / 3 complex , the daughter filament and the capping protein ) and 322 locally refined to improve the density of each segment . Before running local refinement 323 on daughter filament and capping protein , the particles and consensus map were re - 324 centred on DA3 using Volume Alignment Tools in cryoSPARC to improve the 325 alignment because they are at the periphery of the consensus reconstruction . After 326 local refinement on the daughter filament , the complete first cortactin F - actin repeat 327 density was observed . After local refinement on capping protein , the capping protein 328 density was well resolved . 3D classification showed that the daughter filament 329 segment of all 3 classes had the identical feature containing only four actin subunits 330 plus one capping protein heterodimer . A high molar ratio of capping protein to actin in 331 our reaction mix contributes to the short daughter filament . The template picking and 332 ab - initio reconstruction step may also bias the particle selection used in our 333 reconstruction . Global resolution and local resolution of local refined maps are 334 estimated in cryoSPARC ( Extended Data Fig . 3 ) . 335 336 Model building 337 The four locally refined reconstructions were used to model Arp2 / 3 and cortactin NtA , 338 daughter filament and cortactin first central repeat , capping protein and mother 339 filament ( Extended Data Fig . 2 , 3 ) . Models of all seven Arp2 / 3 subunits , β actin and 340 capping protein created with the AlphaFold Monomer v2 . 0 pipeline were used initially 341 59 , 60 . They were rigidly fit into EM density using ChimeraX 61 followed by molecular - 342 dynamics flexible fitting using ISOLDE 62 . Namdinator 63 was used to optimize bond 343 geometry , and ISOLDE and Coot 64 were used at the end of the model building process 344 to manually fix Ramachandran outliers , rotamer outliers and clashes . AlphaFold 345 predicts the N - terminus of cortactin with low confidence except for one 6 - turn α - helix , 346 corresponding to the α - helix in our EM density . The AlphaFold - predicted α - helix 347 ( residue 55 - 76 ) was well fitted into the EM density with bulky side chains on one side 348 of the α - helix facilitating its positioning . After the positioning of the NtA helix , the 349 flanking cortactin residues ( 21 – 54 and 80 - 116 ) were manually built using Coot 64 . 350 351 Structural analysis and visualization 352 Structural figures and movies were made with ChimeraX 61 .
