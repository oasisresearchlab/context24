Abstract The efficient entry of nanotechnology - based pharmaceuticals into target cells is highly desired to reach high therapeutic efficiency while minimizing the side effects . Despite intensive research , the impact of the surface coating on the mechanism of nanoparticle uptake is not sufficiently understood yet . Herein , we present a mechanistic study of cellular internalization pathways of two mag - netic iron oxide nanoparticles ( MNPs ) differing in surface chemistry into A549 cells . The MNP uptake was investigated in the pres - ence of different inhibitors of endocytosis and monitored by spectroscopic and imaging techniques . The results revealed that the route of MNP entry into cells strongly depends on the surface chemistry of the MNPs . While serum bovine albumin - coated MNPs entered the cells via clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) , caveolin - mediated endocytosis ( CavME ) or lipid rafts were preferential - ly involved in the internalization of polyethylene glycol - coated MNPs . Our data indicate that surface engineering can contribute to an enhanced delivery efficiency of nanoparticles . 270 Introduction Magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles ( MNPs ) as chemically inert material have been increasingly employed as contrast agents in magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , positron emission tomogra - phy ( PET ) , and near - infrared fluorescence ( NIRF ) imaging [ 1 ] . The superparamagnetic properties of MNPs make them eligible for the targeted delivery of the drug - loaded particles to the tumor mass via an external magnetic field [ 2 ] . Furthermore , MNPs are promising biosensors [ 3 ] and antimicrobial tools [ 4 ] , Beilstein J . Nanotechnol . 2021 , 12 , 270 – 281 . 271 and they play an important role in the development of multi - functional theranostics to combat cancer [ 5 ] . MNPs are easily manufactured and biocompatible . Also , there are physiological - ly well tolerated as iron is an essential nutrient for almost all life forms [ 6 ] . Iron oxide nanoparticles are the only one FDA - ap - proved magnetic nanoparticles for biomedical application ( Resovist ) . Efficient cellular internalization of nanoparticles is one of the critical steps during the development of new nanotechnology - based pharmaceuticals . Nanoparticles can enter the cell through various specific and non - specific pathways of endocytosis , divided into two broad categories , that is , phagocytosis and pinocytosis [ 7 ] . While phagocytosis occurs primarily in special - ized cells , such as macrophages or monocytes , other endocytic pathways occur in virtually all cells [ 8 ] . Clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) is the predominant endocytosis pathway and is involved mainly in nutrient intake and intracellular com - munication [ 9 , 10 ] . CME is initiated by the polymerization of clathrin units resulting in the assembly of a basket - like struc - ture ( clathrin - coated pit ) with a size of 120 – 150 nm at the inner layer of the plasma membrane [ 11 ] . An alternative endocytosis pathway is caveolin - mediated endocytosis ( CavME ) , the second most important route of cellular entry . Caveolae are character - istic flask - shaped membrane invaginations with an average size of 50 – 100 nm [ 12 ] , lined by caveolin and enriched with choles - terol and sphingolipids . The deeply invaginated clathrin or caveolin pits are then fissured from the membrane by GTPase dynamin . Macropinocytosis , a clathrin - and caveolin - indepen - dent endocytosis pathway , occurs via actin - driven membrane protrusions . The large endocytic vesicle has a size bigger than 1 µm [ 13 ] . Alternative pathways of endocytosis involve other types of cholesterol - rich microdomains called “lipid rafts” , small structures of 40 – 50 nm in diameter [ 14 ] , or glycosylphos - phatidylinositol ( GPI ) - anchored proteins [ 15 ] . Inorganic nanoparticles are frequently engineered with an organic surface coating to improve their biocompatibility , colloidal stability , and bioavailability . Moreover , the coating facilitates their further functionalization to increase their accu - mulation in the tumor mass [ 3 ] . Numerous coating moieties have been employed to modify the surface properties of MNPs [ 16 ] . Among them , polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) , a non - degrad - able polyether of the monomer ethylene glycol , and bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) , a versatile protein carrier , are the most frequently used materials for biomedical applications [ 17 - 20 ] . The impact of the surface chemistry on the mechanism of nano - particle uptake has not been sufficiently clarified yet . MNPs with comparable basic physicochemical characteristics ( e . g . , particle size , surface charge , and magnetism ) differing only in surface modification , BSA - SO - MNPs and PEG - SO - MNPs , have been synthesized to study the effect of surface modification on cellular internalization . Human lung A549 cells were selected as a model system to investigate the uptake of surface - modified MNPs . These cells are a valuable in vitro model of human alveolar epithelial type - 2 cells [ 21 ] , which are considered as drivers of lung fibrosis [ 22 ] and lung tumor de - velopment [ 23 ] . Inhalation therapy represents a prospective non - invasive curative modality for lung cancer and a therapy for other lung illnesses [ 24 ] . Drug delivery through the inhala - tion of nanoparticles is a promising treatment modality against lung cancers conferring high pulmonary drug concentrations while minimizing the side effects [ 25 ] . The internalized amount of the tested MNPs in A549 cells in the presence of compounds that inhibit either endocytosis or cytoskeleton dynamics was quantified by atomic absorption spectroscopy ( AAS ) and the uptake was verified by fluorescent microscopy . The uptake route of the tested MNPs differed depending on the surface coating . While BSA - SO - MNPs were internalized via CME , PEG - SO - MNPs were preferentially taken up through CavME or lipid rafts . Co - localization studies con - firmed the entrapment of fluorescently labeled RITC - BSA - SO - MNPs in clathrin - coated vesicles in A549 cells stably expressing green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) - clathrin . The results indicate that tuning of the MNP surface chemistry can poten - tially provide delivery strategies featuring enhanced targeting . Results Expression of the key proteins involved in the endocytosis in A549 cells The determination of the proficiency / deficiency of cells regarding key proteins involved in specific endocytic pathways is essential before defining the route of cellular uptake of nano - particles . Therefore , initial experiments were focused on the expression of clathrin heavy chain ( CLHC ) , dynamin ( Dyn ) , caveolin - 1 ( Cav1 ) , and its phosphorylated form ( pCav1 ) in A549 cells . The expression of CLHC and Cav1 was determined at the protein ( Supporting Information File 1 , Figure S1A ) and the mRNA level ( Supporting Information File 1 , Figure S1B ) . The expression of Dyn was analyzed only at the protein level . Our results demonstrated that A549 cells are proficient in both CME and CavME pathways . The effect of endocytic inhibitors on cell proliferation and morphology The experiments with the positive controls confirmed the ability of endocytic inhibitors to block the specific route of endo - cytosis . None of the endocytic inhibitors affected cell viability and proliferation activity with the exception of nocodazole Beilstein J . Nanotechnol . 2021 , 12 , 270 – 281 . 272 ( Noc ) ( Supporting Information File 1 , Figure S2 ) . Short - term exposure of cells to surface - modified MNPs and Noc affect substantially the cell proliferation and morphology . Noc affects microtubule formation , thus interfering with cytoskeleton struc - ture and mitosis , leading to cell cycle arrest in G2 / M [ 26 ] . As MNPs interfere with tubulin polymerization as well [ 27 ] , the combined treatment could multiply the microtubule - disrupting effect of Noc . The effect of endocytic inhibitors on the internalization of BSA - SO - MNPs and PEG - SO - MNPs In the absence of inhibitors , differences in the internalized amount of surface - modified MNPs in A549 cells were found . PEG - SO - MNPs were taken up by A549 cells more efficiently than BSA - SO - MNPs ( 8 . 3 pg / cell vs 0 . 39 pg / cell , respectively ) . The impact of inhibitors on the internalization of BSA - SO - MNPs is shown in Figure 1 . A significant decrease in the inter - nalized amount of BSA - SO - MNPs was quantified in cells treated with CME inhibitors , that is , chlorpromazine ( CPZ ) , monodansylcadaverine ( MDC ) , and dynasore ( Dyn ) . Only negligible changes in BSA - SO - MNP uptake were found in cells treated with CavME inhibitors , that is filipin ( F ) , nystatin ( N ) , and methyl - β - cyclodextrin ( MBCD ) . A slight reduction in the internalized amount of BSA - SO - MNPs was also detected in cells treated with Noc but the decrease did not reach signifi - cance . Figure 1 : The effect of endocytic inhibitors on the internalization of BSA - SO - MNPs . MNPs – BSA - SO - MNPs ( 2 mM ) , CPZ – chlorpro - mazine ( 25 µM ) , MDC – monodansylcadaverine ( 150 µM ) , Dyn – dyna - sore ( 80 µM ) , F – filipin ( 5 µM ) , N – nystatin ( 20 µM ) , MBCD – methyl - β - cyclodextrin ( 100 uM ) , NOC – nocodazole ( 25 µM ) . Data are given as mean values ± SD from at least three independent experiments carried out twice . In contrast , a substantial reduction in the internalized amount of PEG - SO - MNPs was detected in the presence of CavME and lipid - raft inhibitors ( Figure 2 ) . These results indicated that PEG - SO - MNPs entered into A549 cells via CavME or another CME - independent route of endocytosis . Surprisingly , the inhi - bition of CME by CPZ and MDC resulted in a significantly in - creased uptake of PEG - SO - MNPs compared to control cells . Figure 2 : The effect of endocytic inhibitors on the internalization of PEG - SO - MNPs . MNPs – PEG - SO - MNPs ( 2 mM ) , CPZ – chlorpro - mazine ( 25 µM ) , MDC – monodansylcadaverine ( 150 µM ) , Dyn – dyna - sore ( 80 µM ) , F – filipin ( 5 µM ) , N – nystatin ( 20 µM ) , MBCD – methyl - β - cyclodextrin ( 100 uM ) , NOC – nocodazole ( 25 µM ) . Data are given as mean values ± SD from at least two independent experiments carried out twice . Positive controls A fluorescently labeled Alexa Fluor 594 – transferrin conjugate ( Tr ) , which enters the cell via CME [ 28 ] and a cholera toxin B subunit – fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) conjugate ( ChT ) , the internalization of which is mediated via CavME [ 29 ] , were used as positive controls to test the ability of inhibitors to affect par - ticular endocytic pathways ( Supporting Information File 1 , Figure S3 ) . Image analysis revealed a blocking of Tr internal - ization after cell exposure to CPZ and MDC , inhibitors of CME , although the effect of MDC was less pronounced . A substantial reduction of ChT internalization was found after cell exposure to F and N , inhibitors of CavME ; the effect of F was higher than that of N . Interestingly , MBCD could neither inhibit the cellu - lar internalization of Tr nor that of ChT . Application of Dyn resulted in the accumulation of Tr as well as that of ChT in larger spots , probably in the clathrin - coated pits / caveolae at the inner side of the membrane that might not be pinched off . No distinct changes in Tr or ChT uptake were observed in cells exposed to Noc . Co - localization study To avoid misinterpretation of results obtained from AAS because of the relatively low uptake of BSA - SO - MNPs into A549 cells ( 0 . 39 pg / cell ) fluorescently labeled rhodamine B iso - thiocyanate ( RITC ) - BSA - SO - MNPs were synthesized . Further - more , to verify the assumed route of entry and cellular localiza - tion of BSA - SO - MNPs , genetically engineered A549 cells stably expressing FITC – clathrin were prepared ( Supporting Information File 1 , Figure S4 ) . In the absence of endocytic in - Beilstein J . Nanotechnol . 2021 , 12 , 270 – 281 . 273 hibitors , the red signal of RITC - BSA - SO - MNPs co - localized with the green signal of FITC – clathrin resulted in a yellow signal . The images from fluorescent microscopy indicated the uptake of RITC - BSA - SO - MNPs via CME . In the presence of CPZ and MDC , which are CME inhibitors , the yellow signal ( co - localization ) or the red signal ( corresponding to free RITC - BSA - SO - MNPs ) were mainly localized at the cell membrane while clathrin ( green signal ) was detected in the cytoplasm ( Figure 3B and Figure 3C ) . These results confirmed the domi - nant role of CME in the internalization of BSA - coated MNPs . In the presence of Dyn , the signal of RITC - BSA - SO - MNPs and FITC – clathrin was co - localized on the cell membrane ( yellow signal ) , indicating the accumulation of a fraction of nanoparti - cles in the clathrin - coated pits ( Figure 3D ) . The pattern of the co - localization signal of RITC - BSA - SO - MNPs and FITC – clathrin implied that the lipid - raft inhibitor might also affect the CME uptake ( Figure 3E ) . In contrast , the application of CavME inhibitors did not substantially affect the internaliza - tion of RITC - BSA - SO - MNPs into A549 cells ( Figure 3F and Figure 3G ) . No reduction in the co - localization pattern of RITC - BSA - SO - MNPs and FITC – clathrin was measured in A549 cells exposed to CavME inhibitors ( i . e . , F and N ) . Discussion The internalization of nanoparticles is a dynamic energy - de - pendent and highly regulated process , affected by physicochem - ical characteristics of nanoparticles ( e . g . , shape , size , surface chemistry , and surface charge ) , cell membrane properties ( fluidity , type of receptors , and receptor density ) , and cell type [ 30 - 32 ] . For biomedical applications , the optimal size of nanocarriers is in the range of 95 – 200 nm because of the higher accumulation rate in tumors [ 33 , 34 ] . Spherical nanoparticles ( NPs ) in the range of 100 – 200 nm have been shown to extrava - gate through vascular fenestrations of tumors ( the EPR effect ) and escape filtration by liver and spleen [ 35 ] . Nanoparticles smaller than 10 nm can be easily cleared by physiological systems ( filtration through the kidney ) , while particles larger than 200 nm may be cleared by phagocytic cells in the reticulo - endothelial system ( RES ) . Many studies reported that thera - peutic nanoparticles in the size range of 20 – 200 nm showed a higher accumulation rate in tumors because they cannot be recognized by the RES nor filtrated by the kidney [ 33 , 36 ] . In case of a pulmonary disease , where the airway – mucus barrier is difficult to penetrate , nanoparticles in the size range of 200 nm are more effective in mucus penetration [ 20 , 37 ] . The effect of surface chemistry on the mechanism of NPs uptake is , however , not sufficiently understood yet . Understanding the distinct path - way ( s ) underlying cellular uptake and the parameters influ - encing this process is of great importance for the design of new tailored nanovectors for different cells / tissues in biomedical ap - plications . It is well documented that the physicochemical parameters of nanoparticles substantially affect the uptake . Once NPs enter bi - ological fluids ( blood or culture medium with serum ) , proteins immediately adsorb onto the surface of the NPs , forming a layer called protein corona ( PC ) . The PC changes the surface compo - sition and structure of NPs , directly influences the cell – NP interactions , determines the toxicity of NPs , and affects geome - try and size of NPs , which play a crucial role in cellular uptake [ 38 , 39 ] . Despite nearly identical magnetite core size , hydrody - namic size , and zeta potential of the MNPs in the stock solution , the hydrodynamic size of PEG - SO - MNPs in culture medium was almost three times that of BSA - SO - MNPs ( 281 nm vs 98 nm , respectively ) due to absorption of serum proteins on the particle surface [ 40 ] . Although PEGylation decreases the pro - tein absorption on the particle surface , it does not completely prevent it [ 41 ] . BSA is a component of serum proteins and com - monly involved in PC formation . Hence , coating of MNPs with BSA can be considered as a PC per se . As a dysopsonin protein , albumin promotes a prolonged blood circulation time through blocking the recognition by macrophages [ 42 ] . A comprehen - sive characterization of nanoparticles in biological fluids is , therefore , essential for the interpretation of their biological effects , including cellular uptake [ 43 ] . Nevertheless , PEG - SO - MNPs were more efficiently internalized into A549 cells than BSA - SO - MNPs . Interestingly , the magnetic nanospheres ( PEG - SO - MNPs coated with polylactic - co - glycolic acid , PLGA ) were taken up by A549 cells to the same extent as BSA - SO - MNPs , even though their hydrodynamic particle size was more than five times larger [ 44 ] . A less efficient uptake of BSA - coated MNPs compared to PEG - coated MNPs has been observed also in primary murine podocytes [ 45 ] . Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles covered with BSA were shown to possess a lower affinity to the cellular membrane [ 42 ] . This lower level of “stickiness” to the cellular membrane could explain the low uptake into A549 cells compared to PEG - SO - MNPs . The sur - face chemistry of nanoparticles was shown to largely determine the composition of the protein corona in terms of the amount and specificity of proteins adsorbed from the serum , overall affecting the final size of the nanoparticles in the biological fluid [ 46 ] . Because the cellular entry mechanism of identical nanoparticles can differ between cancer cells and non - malignant cells [ 47 ] , only one cell line , human lung A549 cells , proficient in clathrin and caveolin , were employed . Kuhn et al . [ 48 ] confirmed the proficiency of A549 cells regarding these key proteins involved in specific endocytic pathways and demonstrated their presence at the cell membrane and in the cytoplasm . To probe the mechanism involved in NP uptake , various inhibi - tors of endocytosis with a different mechanism of action are Beilstein J .

CPZ causes a loss of clathrin from the cell surface by inhibiting the function of adaptor protein 2 ( AP2 ) , one of the key adaptor proteins in clathrin - mediated endo - cytosis ( CME ) . MDC , a competitive inhibitor , blocks the en - zyme transglutaminase 2 , which is necessary for receptor cross - linking in the region of clathrin - coated pits [ 48 ] . Consistent with our results , Rothen - Rutishauser et al . [ 50 ] and Francia et al . reported that CPZ was more efficient in blocking transferrin ( Tr ) internalization than MDC in A549 cells . Caveolae and lipid raft internalizations are known to be inhibited by N , F , and MBCD through depletion of cholesterol from the cell mem - brane [ 51 ] . While F and N were described to be very specific inhibitors of caveolin - mediated endocytosis ( CavME ) without affecting CME and micropinocytosis [ 50 ] , MBCD is not so spe - cific . It can affect components of the transport machinery involved in multiple endocytic pathways including CME , depending on the concentration used [ 51 ] . F binds cholesterol within membranes while N perturbs cholesterol levels by inhibi - tion of de novo synthesis [ 52 ] . While both F and N blocked the internalization of cholera toxin ( ChT ) into A549 cells , no effect of MBCD on ChT uptake was observed . Similar results were obtained in J774A . 1 macrophages [ 48 ] . In contrast , Rothen - Rutishauser et al . [ 50 ] did not find any inhibition of ChT uptake after exposure of A549 cells to N or F and only a partial impair - ment of Tr uptake in the presence of MBCD . Dyn , a cell - perme - able small molecule that inhibits GTPase activity of dynamin , acts fast , that is , within seconds . Dynamin is essential for clathrin - coated vesicle formation as well as for ligand uptake through caveolae [ 53 ] . A substantial lower amount of BSA - SO - MNPs was internal - ized in A549 cells in the presence of CME inhibitors and Dyn compared to the control . However , no differences between CPZ and MDC in their capacity to inhibit the internalization of BSA - SO - MNPs were observed . In contrast , none of the CavME in - hibitors reduced significantly the entry of BSA - SO - MNPs into A549 cells . CME as the predominant entry pathway of BSA - SO - MNPs into A549 cells was confirmed quantitatively ( by AAS ) as well as qualitatively ( by image analysis ) , two standard methods commonly utilized to monitor the uptake of nanomate - rials [ 54 ] . In agreement with our results , Yumoto et al . [ 55 ] also determined the predominant uptake of fluorescently labeled albumin via CME in A549 cells . The authors supposed that macropinocytosis but not CavME may also be involved in albumin internalization . Similarly , the internalization of BSA - SO - MNPs via CME was also observed in murine primary podocytes and mesangial cells ( unpublished results ) . In endo - thelial cells , albumin has been shown to bind to albondin , a 60 kDa glycoprotein ( gp60 ) receptor localized in caveolae . The interaction between gp60 and caveolin - 1 , which is upregulated in many cancer types [ 56 ] aids the vesicle formation , facili - tating the accumulation of albumin in the tumor mass [ 57 ] . This phenomenon forms the basis of Abraxane , a 130 nm paclitaxel - bound albumin nanodrug [ 58 ] . There is , however , no evidence that albondin is expressed on tumor cells ; in contrast , albumin - binding proteins are present on various human tumor cell lines derived from solid tumors [ 59 ] . In contrast to BSA - SO - MNPs , CavME was the predominant mechanism involved in the uptake of PEG - SO - MNPs . The internalized quantity of PEG - SO - MNPs was substantially lower compared with control cells when F , N , MBCD , or Dyn were added to the culture medium . Similar to our results , Branden - berger et al . [ 60 ] also observed a reduced internalization of PEG - coated gold nanoparticles after exposure to the endocytic inhibitor MBCD . As the hydrodynamic size in the culture medium was increased ( for BSA - SO - MNPs from 70 to 98 nm and for PEG - SO - MNPs from 76 to 281 nm ) this phenomenon might contribute to differ - ent cell uptake pathways as well . Inhibiting CME resulted in the preferential uptake of smaller NPs ( smaller than 200 nm ) into cells via CME . Larger NPs ( larger than 200 nm ) were internal - ized by CavME [ 29 ] , just like in our study . In line with our results , Langston Suen and Chau [ 61 ] reported the uptake of folate - decorated NPs of 50 nm in size by CME into retinal pig - ment epithelium cells , while 250 nm particles were dominated by CavME . Surprisingly , the addition of CME inhibitors to the culture me - dium increased the uptake of PEG - SO - MNPs . CME is the major endocytic pathway in mammalian cells ; about 95 % of all molecules internalized into cells are taken up via clathrin - coated pits [ 62 ] . It is reasonable to suppose that inhibition of this path - way by CME inhibitors , on one hand , and saturation of clathrin - independent endocytic pathways by exposure to PEG - SO - MNPs , on the other hand , could compromise cellular homeosta - sis and result in cellular stress . A close relation between endo - cytosis and cellular stress has been highlighted in several publi - cations [ 63 ] . We can hypothesize that under such conditions either different endocytic pathways , for example , macropinocy - tosis as suggested by Rothen - Rutishauser et al . [ 50 ] or non - selective alternative endocytic structures , discussed by Boucrot et al . [ 64 ] or Vega et al . [ 65 ] , could be upregulated to provide compensatory endocytic pathways . Unfortunately , the regula - tion of CME under different physiological conditions is poorly understood and other studies are required to bridge this gap in our knowledge .

BSA - SO - MNPs were internalized via CME while PEG - SO - MNPs were taken up via CavME or lipid rafts . These findings confirm the major role of nanoparticle coatings on cellular entry mechanisms . Our data suggest that the effects of endocytic inhibitors on the internal - ization pathways are rather complex . MNPs may be internal - ized by several endocytic pathways simultaneously , although with varying efficiency , and inhibition of one endocytic path - way can subsequently stimulate other routes of their internaliza - tion . Understanding the mechanisms of cellular uptake is of par - ticular importance for the design of new nanotechnology - based pharmaceuticals and their targeting to specific intracellular loca - tions . Experimental Magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles ( MNPs ) Synthesis , coating , and physicochemical characteristics of the spherical magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles with magnetite ( Fe 3 O 4 ) core and different hydrophilic shells have been published before [ 37 ] . Two types of MNPs were used in this study : BSA - SO - MNPs ( weight ratio of BSA / magnetite = 2 ) and PEG - SO - MNPs ( weight ratio of PEG / magnetite = 0 . 25 ) . Addi - tionally , RITC - BSA - SO - MNPs ( RITC / BSA , ratio 4 : 1 ) were used in some experiments . The basic characteristics of these nanoparticles in the solvent and culture medium are shown in Table 1 . Dynamic light scattering ( DLS ) Particle size distribution and zeta potential of the surface - modi - fied MNPs in stock solution and culture medium were deter - mined by DLS using a Zetasizer Nano - ZS ( Malvern Instru - ments , UK ) equipped with a 4 mW helium / neon laser ( λ = 633 nm ) and a thermoelectric temperature controller at 37 °C . The characteristics of nanoparticles and culture medium have been published before [ 66 , 67 ] . Cell line A549 ( ATCC ® CCL - 185™ ) cells were obtained from Lamb - daLife ( Bratislava , Slovakia ) . The cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium ( DMEM ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) and antibiotics ( penicillin , 100 U / mL ; streptomycin and kanamycin , 100 µg / mL ) . Cells seeded at a density of 2 × 10 3 cm − 2 to 1 × 10 4 cm − 2 , were cultured in a humidified atmosphere of 5 % CO 2 at 37 °C . In all experiments , cells were exposed to MNPs in a medium supple - mented with 2 % FBS . A549 cells up to 20 generations ( passaged two times per week ) were used in the experiments . Treatment of cells After reaching exponential growth , cells were pre - treated with inhibitors of endocytosis or cytoskeleton dynamics for 1 h . Because endocytosis is a very fast process , the inhibitors are usually added to the culture cell media only for a short period of 1 – 2 h [ 68 ] . After pre - treatment , the medium was removed and a fresh medium containing the particular inhibitor and surface - modified MNPs was added to the cells for an additional time of 1 h . Cell exposure was finished by sucking off the culture medi - um and washing the cells twice with phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) . An illustration of the treatment is shown in Figure 4 . The final concentrations of individual inhibitors of endocytosis or cytoskeleton dynamics were prepared freshly before use from the stock solutions . The final concentrations were prepared by dilution in a culture medium with 2 % FBS . The stock solutions Beilstein J .

Nocodazole ( Noc , 16 . 6 mM ) was dissolved in DMSO , split to aliquots , and kept at − 20 °C . The final concentration of DMSO never exceeded 0 . 52 % ( v / v ) . At this concentration , no cytotoxic and genotoxic effects were detected in A549 cells [ 69 ] . The final concentrations of the individual inhibitors are shown in Table 2 . Control cells were treated with fresh culture medium and cells exposed only to MNPs for 1 h were consid - ered as a positive control . These concentrations were selected based on the cell viability determined by MTT assay ( Support - ing Information File 1 , Figure S5 and Figure S6 ) . All inhibitors were purchased from Sigma - Aldrich ( Slovakia ) . The cells exposed to culture medium were used as negative control and cells exposed only to MNPs for 1 h were considered as a posi - tive control . The concentration of surface - modified MNPs was expressed as mM ( mmol / L ) of magnetite to apply equal numbers of nanoparticles to A549 cells . The stock solutions of PEG - SO - MNPs ( 194 mM ) , BSA - SO - MNPs ( 90 . 6 mM ) , and RITC - BSA - SO - MNPs ( 81 . 74 mM ) were kept at 4 °C . The final concentration of surface - modified MNPs was 2 mM . RITC - BSA - SO - MNPS were diluted in a phenol - free medium to avoid interference . MTT assay The cytotoxicity of MNPs and endocytic inhibitors in A549 cells was assessed by the 3 - ( 4 , 5 - dimethylthiazol - 2 - yl ) - 2 , 5 - diphenyltetrazolium bromide ( MTT ) assay following the protocol by Mosmann [ 70 ] with minor modifications . In brief , cells were plated in plastic 96 - well plates at a density of 4 × 10 3 cells per well . The photometric evaluation ( at 540 nm excitation and 690 nm emission wavelengths ) was carried out using a Multiskan Multisoft plate reader ( Labsystems , Finland ) Beilstein J . Nanotechnol . 2021 , 12 , 270 – 281 . 278 and Genesis software provided by the manufacturer . As the color of MNPs is dark brown and may interfere with the spec - trophotometry readings , the net readings were corrected accord - ing to Häfeli and co - workers [ 71 ] . Time - lapse imaging of cells Exponentially growing A549 cells were seeded on a 24 - well tissue plate , at a density of 5 × 10 4 cells per well . After reaching exponential growth , they were exposed to MNPs in the pres - ence or absence of inhibitors as described above . After the treat - ment , cells were washed with PBS and post - cultivated in fresh DMEM supplemented with 10 % FBS . Phase - contrast images were taken using the IncuCyte ZOOM™ Live Content Imaging System ( Essen BioScience , Hertfordshire , UK ) at 2 h intervals . Cell morphology and confluence after exposure to inhibitors were monitored using the IncuCyte ZOOM 2013A software as recommended by the manufacturer . Real - time RT - PCR ( qRT - PCR ) Total RNA was isolated from cells using the phenol - chloro - form method ( TRIzol , Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) as recom - mended by the manufacturer and then purified and treated with DNase I . RNA concentration and purity were measured on a spectrophotometer ( NanoDrop , Thermo Scientific ) . Degrada - tion of RNA was excluded by electrophoresis . The cDNA was prepared using the RevertAid First Strand cDNA kit ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) using 1 µg of total RNA according to the protocol recommended by the manufacturer . Gene expression was measured by semi - quantitative real - time PCR using SYBR Green dye ( Maxima SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix kit ) and appropriate primers , CLHC forward primer ( 5 ′ - CCTAAACAC - CTCAACGATGAC - 3 ′ ) , CLHC reverse primer ( 5 ′ - GTAAAACCAGTATTTCGTCAC - 3 ′ ) , Cav1 forward primer ( 5 ′ - ACAATCGCTGGAAACAGAGT - 3 ′ ) , Cav1 reverse primer ( 5 ′ - TGCAGGAGTTCTTCAGCCAAT - 3 ′ ) , GAPDH forward primer ( 5 ′ - GCCAAAAGGGTCATCATCTC - 3 ′ ) , and GAPDH reverse primer ( 5 ′ - CTAAGCAGTTGGTGGTGCAG - 3 ′ ) , on a CFX96TM Real - Time PCR Detection System cycler ( Bio - Rad ) . Specifically , samples were denatured at 95 °C for 10 min , and the quantification program had 40 repeats ( 30 s annealing at 60 °C , 30s amplification at 72 °C ) . GAPDH was used as a “housekeeping” gene for the normalization of data . Western blotting Cells were lysed in buffer containing 50 mM Tris / HCl , pH 7 . 4 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 % Triton X - 100 , and 1 mM EDTA , supple - mented with protease inhibitor mix ( Serva , BioTech , Ltd . , Slovakia ) . After determining the protein concentration using the Bradford assay , equal amounts of proteins were boiled in Laemmli buffer and separated on a 10 % polyacrylamide SDS - PAGE gel . After transfer of proteins onto nitrocellulose mem - branes the following primary antibodies were used : anti - Clathrin Heavy Chain ( P1663 ) ( # 2410 ) , anti - Caveolin - 1 ( # 3238 ) , anti - Phospho - Caveolin - 1 ( Tyr14 ) ( # 3251 ) , anti - Dynamin I / II ( # 2342 ) ( Cell Signaling Technology , BioTech Ltd . , Slovakia ) , and anti - GAPDH ( Sigma - Aldrich , Lambda Life , Ltd . , Slovakia ) . Secondary peroxidase - labeled donkey anti - rabbit IgG ( GE Healthcare , Germany ) antibodies were visualized with Luminol and coumaric acid ( Sigma - Aldrich , Slovakia ) . Atomic absorption spectrometry ( AAS ) AAS was adapted to quantify the internalized amount of MNPs . All samples were analyzed twice by flame atomic absorption spectrometry for Fe . Cells were seeded on a Petri dish ( 100 mm diameter ) at a density of 1 × 10 6 cells per plate . At 75 % to 80 % confluence , they were exposed to MNPs in the presence or absence of inhibitors as described above . After the treatment , the number of cells was calculated , cells were harvested and digested using HNO 3 ( 500 μ L ) in an ultrasonic bath at 85 °C for 2 h . The digests were then diluted with 2 % HNO 3 in deionized water . The instrumental parameters for Fe determination were set as follows : wavelength 248 . 3 nm , slit width 0 . 2 nm , flame type : acetylene – air , flow : 2 . 0 L / min for acetylene and 13 . 5 L / min for air , deuterium background correction , method of the calibration curve in the range 0 . 1 – 10 mg / L . The limit of detection ( LOD ) and limit of quantification ( LOQ ) for the AAS instrument were 0 . 0015 mg / L and 0 . 0049 mg / L , respectively . LOD and LOQ for the AAS method were 0 . 0074 mg / L and 0 . 0245 mg / L , respectively . Generation of stable clathrin - GFP expression cell line Plasmid CLLCb - pEGFP ( clathrin light chain B fused to en - hanced green fluorescent protein ) and vector pcDNA 3 . 1 ( + ) with neomycin resistance were transfected into A549 cells in a ratio of 7 : 1 using GeneCellin™ ( Bio Cell Challenge ) kit accord - ing to the manufacturer’s instructions . After 24 h , transfected A549 cells were selected in DMEM containing 10 % FBS and 800 µg / mL geneticin G - 418 . Plasmid CLLCb - pEGFP was kindly provided by Prof . Ernst J . Ungewickell ( Department of Cell Biology , Centre of Anatomy , Hannover Medical School , Germany ) and vector pcDNA 3 . 1 ( + ) was kindly provided by Katarina Luciakova , DSc . ( Cancer Research Institute , Biomedi - cal Research Center SAS , Bratislava , Slovakia ) . Single - cell clones were selected and amplified by dilution cloning in 6 - well plates . Immunofluorescence staining Cells were grown on glass coverslips in 48 - well plates overnight before incubation with Alexa Fluor 594 – Transferrin conjugate ( 25 µg / mL ) or cholera Toxin B subunit – FITC conju - Beilstein J . Nanotechnol . 2021 , 12 , 270 – 281 . 279 gate ( 5 mg / mL ) at 37 °C for 1 h in medium supplemented with 2 % FBS . In the case of the co - localization study , a phenol - free medium was used to avoid interference . FITC – clathrin A549 cells were pre - treated with inhibitor for 1 h and then treated for 1 h with RITC - BSA - SO - MNPs in the presence of the same in - hibitor for another period of 1 h in phenol - free medium . Treat - ment was finished by three washes with PBS before fixation in 4 % paraformaldehyde at room temperature ( RT ) for 20 min . Then , cells were permeabilized in 0 . 05 % Triton X - 100 / PBS at RT for 15 min , washed with PBS , and blocked in 3 % BSA / PBS at RT for 30 min . For F - actin staining , the coverslips were incu - bated with Alexa Fluor 488 Phalloidin or Alexa Fluor 546 Phal - loidin ( Life Technologies , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) ( dilution 1 : 500 ) at 37 °C for 1 h . After washing with PBS , 4 , 6 - diamide - 2 - phenylindole ( DAPI ) ( dilution 1 : 500 ) was added for nuclear staining ( at 37 °C , 15 min ) . Finally , after washing with PBS and sterile water , the coverslips were mounted on glass slides with mounting medium ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . Images were obtained with a fluorescent microscope ( Axio Imager , Zeiss ) using ISIS soft - ware from the company MetaSystems GmbH ( Altlussheim , Germany ) at 630× magnification . Statistical analysis Data are given as mean values ± SD . The differences between control cells and treated cells were evaluated by Student´s t - test and one - way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) . The threshold of statistical significance was set at p < 0 . 05 .
