We obtained self - reported information on systemic reactogenicity day - by - day during two weeks for 2862 healthcare workers vaccinated with heterologous AZD1222 + BNT162b2 or homologous BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 regimens and compared prevalences of symptoms with unvaccinated healthcare workers . We found comparable systemic reactogenicity during the first week in the two vaccine regimens and no reactogenicity during the second week . Most of the symptoms returned to a level equal to the control population four days after booster vaccination . Keywords COVID - 19 vaccine ; systemic reactogenicity ; vaccine safety ; cohort study ; healthcare workers . Background Heterologous AZD1222 and BNT162b2 COVID - 19 vaccination regimens may activate strong immunogenicity and reactogenicity . [ 1 - 5 ] Mixing of vaccines can be a strategy to contain new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) variants due to a higher efficacy . [ 5 , 6 ] However , reports differ on whether heterologous vaccine regimens induce greater reactogenicity [ 2 ] compared to homologues regimens , [ 1 , 3 - 5 ] and more research is warranted . [ 5 , 6 ] In Denmark , BNT162b2 was used continuously as a prime dose from November 17 , 2020 and as a booster dose from January 18 , 2021 . AZD1222 was used as a prime dose from February 15 until March 11 , 2021 , when it was put on hold due to reports on thrombotic response . [ 7 ] Since April 18 , BNT162b2 was in the current population used as the booster following a prime dose with AZD1222 . Symptoms of systemic reactogenicity are similar to symptoms resulting from common cold and other upper respiratory tract infections , [ 8 ] and we therefore compared the symptoms following AZD1222 + BNT162b2 and BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 regimens with individually matched unvaccinated controls . 3 Methods We followed healthcare workers , technical , administrative , and other staff ( hereafter , called healthcare workers ) who received either heterologous AZD1222 + BNT162b2 or homologous BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 prime - boost vaccination and their daily matched controls , who were unvaccinated healthcare workers day - by - day for 14 days . Neither were previously tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 with reverse transcription polymerase - chain - reaction ( RT - PCR ) . The study population was recruited into a COVID - 19 risk factor study by e - mail sent to all healthcare workers of the Central Denmark Region November 17 , 2020 . [ 9 , 10 ] Enrolment continued until March 17 , 2021 . Participants were prompted daily via text message on their smartphone to report ( yes / no ) headache , muscle pain , fever , fatigue , and diarrhoea within the last 24 hours . Height and weight were reported at baseline . Information on vaccination and RT - PCR testing for SARS - CoV - 2 was obtained from regional registers with complete coverage . Participants receiving the BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 regimen were followed from January 18 , 2021 and participants receiving the AZD1222 + BNT162b2 regimen from April 14 , 2021 when the first booster doses were administered . All were followed until testing positive for SARS - CoV - 2 , 13 days after receiving the booster , or end of study June 30 , 2021 , whichever came first . The calendar time for the two vaccination regimens were on average displaced by 85 days ( figure 1 ) , and because the symptoms are similar to symptoms resulting from prevalent upper respiratory tract infections that show significant seasonal variation , [ 8 ] we randomly selected four unvaccinated controls with replacement for each day a vaccinated participant reported symptoms ( i . e . date of follow - up ) . Controls were matched on date of follow - up + / - two days , sex and age ( < 40 , 40 - 49 , 50 - 59 , ≥60 years ) . We plotted symptom prevalences by days since booster vaccination . We compared each vaccine regimen with the controls by odds ratios ( ORs ) obtained by conditional logistic regression analyses of all daily reports adjusted for days of follow - up , occupation ( five groups ) , and BMI ( < 20 , 20 - 24 , 25 - 29 , ≥30 ) . ORs are reported for two one - week intervals in order to compare our findings with other vaccine studies . In additional sensitivity analyses we report ORs in shorter time intervals ( days 0 - 3 , 4 - 7 , 8 - 13 ) . We obtained 4 95 % confidence intervals ( CI ) by 50 bootstrap samples to account for the repeated measurements within participants . A p value < 0 . 5 was considered statistically significant . Analyses were conducted with STATA version 17 ( StataCorp LLC , College Station , TX ) . All participants gave written informed consent . The Central Denmark Regional Scientific Ethical Committee approved that ethical approval was not required ( 1 - 10 - 72 - 1 - 20 ) . Results A total of 6861 healthcare workers participated in the dynamic risk factor study , 947 received the AZD1222 + BNT162b2 regimen and provided 11 , 754 daily reports , and 1915 received the BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 regimen and provided 21 , 757 daily reports during follow up ( table 1 ) . The participation rate among vaccinated was 87 . 3 % and 92 . 4 % for the two regimens , respectively . The two matched control groups included 642 participants ( 47 , 016 daily reports ) and 3846 participants ( 87 , 028 daily reports ) , respectively . The age and sex distribution of vaccinated and control participants were identical as expected due to the matching and only minor differences were seen for the non - matched characteristics ( table 1 ) . Mean age of heterologous and homologues vaccinated participants and their controls were 50 . 3 and 51 . 0 years , respectively . The prime and booster vaccines were administered with intervals of 11 - 13 weeks and 3 - 4 weeks in the heterologous and homologous regimen , respectively . The first week following booster vaccination with BNT162b2 , regardless of the prime vaccine , resulted in a higher prevalence of all symptoms compared with the unvaccinated controls ( figure 2 and supplementary table 1 ) . The adjusted ORs in the AZD1222 + BNT162b2 regimen were for headache 3 . 0 ( 95 % CI 2 . 6 - 3 . 4 ) , muscle pain 3 . 7 ( 95 % CI 3 . 2 - 4 . 4 ) , fever 10 . 8 ( 95 % CI 7 . 9 - 15 . 0 ) , fatigue 2 . 3 ( 95 % CI 2 . 0 - 2 . 7 ) , and diarrhoea 2 . 0 ( 95 % CI 1 . 4 - 2 . 8 ) . For the BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 regimen the corresponding figures were for headache 2 . 4 ( 95 % CI 2 . 2 - 2 . 7 ) , muscle pain 4 . 1 ( 95 % CI 3 . 5 - 4 . 7 ) , fever 12 . 1 ( 95 % CI 9 . 4 - 15 . 6 ) , fatigue 1 . 8 ( 95 % CI 1 . 6 - 2 . 1 ) , and diarrhoea 1 . 9 ( 95 % CI 1 . 4 - 2 . 5 ) ( figure 2 and supplementary table 1 ) . During the second week 5 following booster vaccination , reports of symptoms were similar among vaccinated and their respective controls . With the exception of fever , compared to BMI 20 - 24 there was a clear significant association between BMI ≥30 and higher odds of symptoms in both regimens during the two weeks . E . g . in the second week , ORs for muscle pain were 4 . 0 and 2 . 0 in the AZD1222 + BNT162b2 and BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 regimens , respectively . Sensitivity analyses showed the odds of reporting any symptoms were significantly elevated during the first three days after booster vaccination ; e . g . adjusted ORs for reporting fever were 15 . 9 ( 95 % CI 10 . 1 - 25 . 1 ) in the heterologous regimen and 20 . 5 ( 95 % CI 14 . 6 - 28 . 8 ) in the homologous regimen ( table 2 ) . Four days after , reports of the majority of symptoms were similar among vaccinated and their respective controls regardless of regimen . Discussion During the first week after receiving the booster dose , recipients of heterologous AZD1222 + BNT162b2 and homologous BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 reported comparably higher prevalences of headache , muscle pain , fatigue , fever and diarrhoea compared with the unvaccinated controls . During the second week , symptom prevalences were no longer increased . Sensitivity analyses showed almost complete symptom relief four days after booster vaccination regardless of regimen . Shaw et al [ 2 ] and Hillus et al [ 1 ] reported aggregated reactogenicity levels for the first seven days after vaccination with AZD1222 + BNT162b2 and BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 . Shaw et al found a higher frequency of systemic reactogenicity in the heterologous AZD1222 + BNT162b2 regimen , [ 2 ] whereas Hillus et al found a higher frequency in the homologous BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 regimen . [ 1 ] Borobia et al studied the heterologous AZD1222 + BNT162b2 regimen in a randomised trial , [ 3 ] and found similar frequency of systemic reactogenicity as Hillus et al ; [ 1 ] both comparable to homologues AZD1222 and homologues BNT162b2 regimens . Differences in the study population ' s age and intervals between the vaccines might contribute to the differences observed : Shaw et al administered the vaccines in both regimens with a four - week interval among participants with a median age of 57 years . [ 2 ] In the two other studies longer intervals 6 of 8 - 12 [ 3 ] and 10 - 12 [ 1 ] weeks were used in the heterologous regimens , while a similar interval of three weeks were used in the homologues regimen . [ 1 ] Also , their populations were younger ( median age 37 years [ 1 ] and mean age 44 [ 3 ] ) . Our study population had a mean age of 50 . 3 years and 11 - 13 weeks between the vaccines in the heterologous regimen , and 51 . 0 years and 3 - 4 weeks in the homologous regimen . Strengths of our study are the prospective design , day - by - day symptom reports beyond the standard seven days of vaccine trials , a high participation rate , and strict control for date because symptoms of reactogenicity are similar to symptoms resulting from common seasonal upper respiratory infections . [ 8 ] Furthermore , the inclusion of a non - vaccinated control group allowed us to document that after one week the vaccinated participants had no more symptoms than the control population . Limitations include participants being aware of the administered vaccines , which may have affected symptom reporting , the lack of information on symptom severity , and the indirect comparison of the two regimens due to seasonal variation . In conclusion , compared with the control population , heterologous AZD1222 + BNT162b2 and homologous BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 COVID - 19 vaccine regimens show comparable levels of systemic reactogenicity during the first week , but no increased reactogenicity thereafter . Most of the symptoms returned to a level equal to the control population four days after booster vaccination .
