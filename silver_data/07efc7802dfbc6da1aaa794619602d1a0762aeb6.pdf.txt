Gradients generated from these signals help establish position - specific cues in the community , which in turn create different dynamic microenvironments to regulate the differentiation of subpopulations . 2 - 4 Extracellular matrix ( ECM ) is considered a scaffold for signal molecules , which ultimately provides the position cues . 5 In higher eukaryotes , cellular interactions with ECM shape embryogenesis , cell locomotion / migration , tissue / organ development , and even organismal survival . 6 - 9 In the eukaryotic microbe Cryptococcus neoformans , it is shown recently that released adhesion protein Cfl1 in the ECM acts as a matricellular signal to regulate cellular morphological differentiation and the formation of structured biofilm colonies . 10 In this study , we further demonstrated that secretion and the conserved C - terminal SIGC domain of Cfl1 are critical for its multi - functions . ( 1 ) The absence of the N - terminal signal peptide resulted in the intracellular accumulation of Cfl1 and abolished its ability to promote the formation of structured biofilm colonies ; ( 2 ) The deletion of the SIGC domain in Cfl1 reduced the ability of this protein to promote the formation of biofilms ; and ( 3 ) Donor strains expressing this mutant allele failed to evoke any response from the nearby wildtype recipient . By contrast , donor strains expressing the wildtype CFL1 allele elicit the recipient strain to produce filaments and form biofilm colonies . 10 Several lines of evidence presented in this study and the previous one 10 point to the signaling function of this novel and yet conserved adhesion protein . First , the expression of CFL1 can be induced to a high level comparable to other genes producing autoinducers that are well - known regulators of community behaviors in bacteria . 11 During mating colony development , CFL1 is expressed at an equivalent level as the pheromone gene MF1 α , although MF1 α is induced earlier to initiate early mating events while the induction of Cfl1 is concomitant with the later filamentation events . Accordingly , the Cfl1 protein is specifically expressed in the hyphal but not the yeast subpopulation . 10 Second , the deletion of CFL1 ( cfl1 Δ ) attenuates filamentation and colony adherence to agar . Conversely , the overexpression of CFL1 ( CFL1 oe ) enhances filamentation and stimulates the formation of a structured biofilm . Interestingly , neighboring wildtype colonies in close proximity to the CFL1 oe strain also filament and develop biofilm that phenotypically mimicking the CFL1 oe donor strain . Consistently , the endogenous Cfl1 - mCherry in the wild type recipient strain is induced by released signals from the donor strain in a distance - dependent manner , implicating extracellular Cfl1 as a paracrine signal . 10 Third , the released Cfl1 ( rCfl1 ) , with two - thirds of the full length protein from the C - terminus , is * Correspondence to Xiaorong Lin ; Email : xlin @ bio . tamu . edu Submitted : 07 / 26 / 2013 ; Revised : 09 / 09 / 2013 ; Accepted : 09 / 10 / 2013 Citation : Tian X , Lin X .

Cfl1 is naturally highly expressed in the hyphal subpopulation during the mating colony development . Some Cfl1 proteins are cleaved and released to the ECm ( extracellular matrix ) . the released exogenous Cfl1 activates Cryptococcus cells to express their endogenous Cfl1 , to undergo filamentation , and to form structured biofilm colonies . In this study , we demonstrate that the n - terminal signal peptide and the novel conserved cysteine - rich SIGC domain at the C - terminus are critical for the adherence property and the signaling activity of this multifunctional protein . the investigation of this fungal matricel - lular signaling network involving Cfl1 and the master regulator of morphogenesis Znf2 provides a foundation to further elucidate intercellular communication in microbial development . e26444 - 2 Communicative & Integrative Biology Volume 6 enriched in the ECM . When purified rCfl1 is added to the wildtype recipient strain , the recipient undergoes morphogenesis and forms biofilm , similar to the changes observed when the recipient is placed adjacent to the CFL1 oe donor strain . 10 Fourth , as expected for a signal molecule , the secretion of Cfl1 is critical for its function . The intracellularly expressed Cfl1 mutant protein lacking the N - terminal signal peptide [ CFL1 ( sigP Δ ) ] does not accumulate in the ECM . 10 Donor strains expressing such a mutated allele of CFL1 do not form biofilm colonies ( Fig . 1A ) and fail to elicit changes in morphology and colony architecture in the nearby wildtype recipient strain . 10 Fifth , although the truncation of Cfl1’s C - terminus ( aa 230 – 309 Δ ) reduces the ability of Cryptococcus cells to adhere and to undergo filamentation , such mutation does not abolish these properties ( Fig . 1A ) . However , donor strains expressing this truncated CFL1 allele are incapable of eliciting responses from the recipient ( Fig . 1B ) . Thus , the C - terminus is important for Cfl1’s function as an adhesion protein , but it is absolutely critical for the function of Cfl1 as a matricellular signal . Finally , although no annotated domain is indicative of rCfl1’s signaling activity , the cysteine - rich C - terminus ( 80 amino acid residues ) termed SIGC is highly conserved among fungal species in the phylum of Basidiomycota . Intriguingly , about 90 % of Cfl1 homologs with SIGC are predicted to be secreted and 50 % domains associated with SIGC are involved in extracellular ligand - receptor interaction . 10 Collectively , these findings suggest that the SIGC domain is involved in the matricellular signal transduction . Signaling mediated by Cfl1 requires the network controlled by the transcription factor Znf2 . Znf2 is the irreplaceable decision maker of morphological transition between the yeast form and the filamentous form in Cryptococcus . 12 - 14 Disruption of ZNF2 in the recipient strain completely prevents the recipient from responding to the Cfl1 matricellular signal released from the donor . 13 By comparison , disruption of Cfl1 in the recipient reduces but does not abolish its response to the exogenous Cfl1 signal . These observations indicate that Cfl1 is Figure 2 . Working model of the paracrine signaling network mediated by Cfl1 .

( A ) the expression of the full length and the truncated Cfl1 - mCherry proteins [ CFL1 ( sigPΔ ) and CFL1 ( 230 – 309Δ ) ] was driven by the promoter of the copper transporter CTR4 ( P CTR4 – 2 ) . Indicated strains were grown on YPD agar medium supplemented with the inducer BCS ( copper chelator ) at 200 μm . Cells were cultured at 22°C for 3 d before being examined under a fluorescence stereoscope . the degree in colony wrinkledness reflects the strength in cell - cell adhesion and the complexity in colony morphology ( or biofilm ) . the deletion of the n - terminal signal peptide ( sigPΔ ) or the SIGC domain ( 230 – 309Δ ) did not significantly affect the protein expression level based on their fluorescence intensity . the C . neoformans strain expressing CFL1 ( sigPΔ ) did not form biofilm colonies while the strain expressing the SIGC truncated allele CFL1 ( 230 – 309Δ ) showed decreased wrinkledness in colony morphology . Scale bar : 1 mm . ( B ) the donor strain expressing the SIGC truncated CFL1 allele failed to evoke the nearby wildtype recipient to form a structured biofilm colony . the confrontation assay was performed on YPD agar medium with 200 μm BCS . the donor strains were precultured for 3 d and then the XL280 recipient strain was placed near the donor colonies . the cells were then photographed after being cultured for additional 5 d .

Taken together , we propose the following model to illustrate the intercellular communication mediated by the rCfl1 matricellular signal in this eukaryotic microbe ( Fig . 2 ) . The released exogenous Cfl1 in the ECM binds to its putative receptor on the cell surface , which then activates Znf2 directly or indirectly . Activated Znf2 induces the expression of its downstream targets , including other cell surface proteins and Cfl1 . The nascent full length Cfl1 is then synthesized and transported in vesicles . The signal peptide is then removed and the resulting mature full length protein is attached to the cell wall and functions as an adhesion protein . Some of the Cfl1 proteins are cleaved and released from the cell wall to the ECM . The released Cfl1 in turn activates the Cryptococcus cells that it comes into contact to express the endogenous Cfl1 , forming a positive feedback loop ( Fig . 2 ) . As the first example of matricellular signaling in fungi , this Cfl1 signaling network provides a paradigm to advance our understanding of intercellular communication in microbes . Furthermore , given the link between morphogenesis and virulence in fungi and other eukaryotic pathogens , 15 - 19 such investigation could also help our understanding of microbial pathogenesis .
