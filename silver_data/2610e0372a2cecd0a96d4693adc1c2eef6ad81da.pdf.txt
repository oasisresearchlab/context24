A R T I C L E S NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 7 | NUMBER 1 | JANUARY 2005 21 Chronophin , a novel HAD - type serine protein phosphatase , regulates cofilin - dependent actin dynamics Antje Gohla 1 , Jörg Birkenfeld 1 and Gary M . Bokoch 1 , 2 Cofilin is a key regulator of actin cytoskeletal dynamics whose activity is controlled by phosphorylation of a single serine residue . We report the biochemical isolation of chronophin ( CIN ) , a unique cofilin - activating phosphatase of the haloacid dehalogenase ( HAD ) superfamily . CIN directly dephosphorylates cofilin with high specificity and colocalizes with cofilin in motile and dividing cells . Loss of CIN activity blocks phosphocycling of cofilin , stabilizes F - actin structures and causes massive cell division defects . Our findings identify a physiological phospho - serine protein substrate for a mammalian HAD - type phosphatase and demonstrate that CIN is an important novel regulator of cofilin - mediated actin reorganization . Proteins of the essential actin - depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) / cofilin family ( referred to here collectively as cofilin ) are responsible for the high actin - filament - turnover rates observed in vivo owing to their F - actin depolymerizing and severing activities 1 – 3 . Because of these properties , cofilin is crucial for the organization and regulation of fundamental cellular processes , including cell division , growth and motility 1 , 4 . Altered cofilin expression or activity is associated with the initiation and progression of various pathophysiological conditions involving actin dynamics , such as cancer , immune deficiencies , neurodegenerative dis - orders and ischemic kidney disease 5 . Cofilin is inhibited by two closely related families of kinases , LIM - kinases ( LIMK ) and testis - specific protein kinases ( TESKS ) , which phosphorylate a single serine residue ( Ser 3 ) on cofilin 6 – 8 . These kinases function downstream of Rho - GTPase - dependent and integrin - initiated pathways , respectively 8 – 10 . Several reports suggest the existence of specific , unconventional cofilin phosphatases that reactivate cofilin - regulatory functions 1 , but their identity has remained obscure . Recently , a dual - specificity - type phosphatase termed Slingshot ( SSH ) was discovered in Drosophila melanogaster as a gene involved in epidermal cell morphogenesis , and was subsequently shown to regulate cofilin - dependent actin dynamics in mammalian cells 11 . In contrast to the ubiquitous expression of cofilin , SSH seems to be predominantly expressed in epithelia , and is not found in organisms such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae , Caenorhabditis elegans and Arabidopsis thaliana , although cofilin ortho - logues in these species have a Ser 3 or equivalent residue 1 , 11 . Furthermore , SSH is not required for processes that depend on cofilin - regulated actin dynamics , such as cell proliferation or viability in D . melanogaster 11 , 12 , nor in human neutrophil chemotaxis 13 , suggesting the involvement of another , so far unidentified , cofilin - regulatory phosphatase . We now report the identification of chronophin ( CIN ) , a broadly expressed and evolutionarily conserved mammalian member of the non - thiol - based HAD superfamily of hydrolases , an unusual enzyme family previously characterized mostly in bacteria 14 . CIN is unrelated to SSH , and functions as a unique cofilin phosphatase . Together , these characteristics suggest that CIN may represent one of the unconventional cofilin phosphatases that has long been postulated . RESULTS Biochemical isolation of CIN CIN was identified by screening bovine brain cytosol fractionated by sequential column chromatographies for an activity that could dephos - phorylate purified , Ser - 3 - phospho - cofilin ( A . G . and G . M . B . , unpublished observations ) . We resolved a cofilin phosphatase activity and sequenced it by tandem mass spectrometry . A sequence match was found with a previously uncharacterized , hypothetical phospho - serine phosphatase with a relative molecular mass ( M r ) of 31 . 7 . Orthologues of this putative protein phosphatase are present in organisms ranging from bacteria to humans ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S1a ) , and the protein is widely distributed throughout human tissues , as determined by northern blot analysis , RT – PCR and western blot analysis ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S1b – d ) . We called this novel protein chronophin ( CIN ) after chronos , the Greek word for time , because it regulates cofilin - depend - ent actin dynamics in a finely tuned temporal and spatial manner . CIN is a HAD - type phosphatase CIN contains a catalytic domain similar to nitrophenylphosphatases from various organisms and three highly conserved sequence motifs 1 The Scripps Research Institute , Departments of Immunology and Cell Biology , 10550 North Torrey Pines Road , La Jolla , CA 92037 , USA . 2 Correspondence should be addressed to G .

Members of this large and ancient family are structurally typified by the L - 2 - haloacid dehalogenase from Pseudomonas species , but also comprise eukaryotic P - type ATPases and an increasing number of magnesium - dependent phosphatases . HAD phosphatases use an unconventional catalytic mech - anism whereby a transition - state phospho - aspartate intermediate forms as a result of a nucleophilic attack on the substrate phosphate group 19 . The relevant , absolutely conserved initial aspartate lies within the N - ter - minal HAD motif DXDXT ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S1a ) , and operates as the nucleophile in all HAD enzymes . The second con - served aspartate of this motif participates in stabilizing the leaving group during the dephosphorylation step and classifies HAD enzymes as phos - phatases 15 , 17 , 18 . Mutation of the nucleophilic aspartate ( Asp 25 in human CIN ) is predicted to severely compromise CIN activity 15 – 18 , 20 . We verified that CIN has intrinsic phosphatase activity , observing that purified , bacterially expressed wild - type CIN ( CIN WT ) hydrolysed the artificial substrate para - nitrophenyl phosphate ( p - NPP ) in a concentration - dependent manner ( data not shown ) . The conservative replacement of the presumed catalytic Asp 25 to asparagine effectively inactivated CIN ( about 1 % residual activity towards p - NPP ) , supporting the presumed phospho - aspartate transferase catalytic mechanism . Thus , the high extent of conservation of the active - site residues among CIN orthologues across evolution , the critical role of the initial aspartate in motif I for catalysis , and inhibitor profiling ( data not shown ) suggest that CIN is a Mg 2 + - dependent HAD - type phospho - aspartate transferase . CIN directly dephosphorylates cofilin We verified that CIN has Ser - 3 - phospho - cofilin phosphatase activity , as indicated by its activity - based isolation . Figure 1a shows that recom - binant CIN dephosphorylated cofilin in a concentration - dependent manner , but did not extensively dephosphorylate autophosphorylated p21 - activated kinase 1 ( Pak1 ) ( 91 . 1 % of control , n = 5 ; ref . 9 ) , or the Pak - 1 - phosphorylated LIMK - 1 kinase domain Kd3 ( 87 . 9 % of control , n = 3 ; ref . 9 ) or myelin basic protein ( 104 . 2 % of control , n = 3 ) at a concentration that strongly dephosphorylated cofilin ( 21 . 5 % of control , n = 5 ) . CIN was also inactive against the broad spectrum of tyrosyl - phosphorylated pro - teins present in pervanadate - stimulated HeLa cells ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S2a ) . Furthermore , CIN showed no detectable activity towards two widely used phospho - tyrosine - containing peptides ( N - DADE ( pY ) LIPQQG - C and N - END ( pY ) INASL - C ) , nor did it hydrolyse a c d b ( − ) CIN C I N C I N D 25 N C I N W T C o n t r o l C o n t r o l C I N C o n t r o l C I N C o n t r o l C I N C o n t r o l C o n t r o l C o n t r o l 32 P - PAK 32 P - XAC 32 P - MBP 32 P - LIMK1 ( Kd3 ) PP 2 A Interphase Mitosis Anti - phospho - AC Anti - phospho - AC Anti - phospho - AC Anti - cofilin Anti - cofilin Anti - actin Anti - cofilin 1 − − − − − 3 . 7 3 . 6 1 . 7 1 1 . 28 0 . 53 1 1 0 . 7 8 . 7 5 . 4 100 62 − 1 1 . 2 0 . 7 100 58 − 1 5 3 . 4 100 68 0 . 14 Fold change in phospho - AC Fold change in phospho - AC Fold change in phospho - AC Percentage phospho - AC EGFP − CIN Endogenous CIN Exogenous : endogenous CIN Anti - CIN Anti - GFP ( CIN ) Anti - LIMK + + − − + − − + − − + − − − − − + − − + − − + LIMK - WT − LIMK - TEE − Kd3 - TEE Anti - phospho - LIMK1 ( Thr 508 ) ControlCIN WT LIMK 1 nM 2 nM 5 nM siRNA oligos Anti - CIN 1 1 . 5 1 1 . 9 1 1 . 2 C I N W T Figure 1 CIN is a cofilin phosphatase .

HeLa cells expressing the indicated constructs were grown under standard culture conditions ( interphase cells ) , or synchronised using thymidine / nocodazole and assayed during cytokinesis ( mitosis ) , as detailed in the Methods section . To estimate the extent of CIN overexpression above endogenous CIN , blots were probed with a CIN - specific antibody . CIN ( WT ) decreases , whereas CIN ( D25N ) elevates endogenous phospho - cofilin levels ( n = 5 ) , and a strong cofilin dephosphorylation after overexpression of CIN ( WT ) is observed during mitosis ( n = 3 ) . ( c ) CIN antagonizes the LIMK1 - mediated increase in phospho - cofilin , but does not dephosphorylate the LIMK1 activation - site phospho - Thr - 508 . HeLa cells were transfected with EGFP ( control ) or EGFP – CIN ( WT ) alone , or together with LIMK1 - WT , the phospho - mimetic LIMK1 - T508EE , or the LIMK1 kinase - domain mutant Kd3 - T508EE .

CIN is a physiological cofilin phosphatase In HeLa cells ( Fig . 1b ) , transfected CIN WT consistently decreased the steady - state phospho - cofilin pool by roughly half . In contrast , cata - lytically inactive CIN D25N elevated net phospho - cofilin levels , function - ing as a dominant - negative phosphatase . These effects were typically observed after a three - to - fourfold overexpression of exogenous CIN above endogenous CIN levels , as detected with a CIN - specific antibody ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S1d ) . Whereas the direct analysis of cofilin phosphoregulation is often complicated by the tight , dynamic control of the cellular phospho - cofilin pool ( reviewed in ref . 1 ) , a transient net change of phospho - cofilin levels can readily be observed during mitosis 21 . Interestingly , CIN WT induced a notable ( about 86 % ) cofilin dephosphorylation dur - ing mitosis after 1 . 7 - fold overexpression above endogenous CIN levels ( Fig . 1b ; also see later ) , suggesting a potential role of CIN for cofilin regulation in dividing cells . The expression of CIN WT also attenuated the LIMK1 - mediated increase in phospho - cofilin levels , further show - ing that CIN and the specific cofilin kinase LIMK1 are functionally antagonistic ( Fig . 1c ) . To rule out the possibility that CIN decreases cellular phospho - cofilin levels indirectly by dephosphorylating LIMK ( TESK was undetectable in our cells 8 ) , we measured phospho - cofilin levels after coexpression of CIN WT with either LIMK1 WT , LIMK1 - T508EE ( the non - dephosphorylatable , phospho - mimetic mutant of the activation - site threonine 9 , 10 in LIMK1 ) , or Kd3 - T508EE ( the equivalent point mutant of the constitutively active LIMK1 - fragment Kd3 ) . In all cases , CIN antagonised the LIMK - induced increase in phospho - cofilin to a similar extent . In addition , immunoblotting with an anti - LIMK antibody specific for phospho - Thr - 508 confirmed that CIN did not dephosphorylate this residue in LIMK1 WT ( Fig . 1c ) . Together with the finding that CIN more efficiently dephosphorylates cofilin than LIMK - Kd3 in vitro ( Fig . 1a ) , these results support the hypothesis that CIN is a direct cofilin phosphatase . We examined whether CIN functions as a physiological cofilin phos - phatase in cells by depleting endogenous CIN protein levels using RNA interference ( RNAi ) . Treatment of HeLa cells with low concentrations of CIN - specific siRNA oligonucleotides decreased CIN protein levels and triggered a concomitant increase in the steady - state phospho - cofilin pool ( Fig . 1d ) . Thus , this loss - of - function approach substantiates a role for CIN as a physiological cofilin phosphatase . To gain further information on the cellular specificity of CIN , we analysed the phosphoprotein profile of mitotic HeLa cells expressing CIN WT ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S2b ) . Interestingly , only minor differences in overall protein phosphorylation were observed compared with control cells , and the two major dephosphorylated proteins detected match ADF and cofilin in apparent molecular weight ( M r of about 19 ) and isoelectric point ( ADF , 8 . 06 ; cofilin , 8 . 22 ) . CIN thus meets the criteria for a ubiquitously expressed , specific cofilin phosphatase with unusual enzymatic properties , as postulated by ear - lier studies ( reviewed in ref . 1 ) . a b Overexpression Control siRNA CIN siRNA Control Endogenous CIN F - actin Endogenous CIN F - actin CIN WT CIN D25N Figure 2 Effects of CIN on the actin cytoskeleton .

We there - fore investigated the effects of CIN on the actin cytoskeleton . More than 80 % of cells expressing CIN WT for extended periods of time ( 48 – 60 h ) were characterized by a dissolution of their cortical actin cytoskeletons and a reduced stress - fibre content ( Fig . 2a ) , and cells eventually rounded up and detached . After short - term expression ( < 24 h ) of CIN WT , 35 % of the cells showed extensive membrane ruf - fling with the formation of polarized lamellipodia , and exogenous CIN colocalized extensively with actin and cofilin in these structures ( see Supplementary Information and data not shown ) . In contrast , CIN D25N led to a general increase in actin polymerization under these conditions , with a notable appearance of multiple , unpolar - ized membrane protrusions in 45 % of transfected cells ( Fig . 2a ) . These morphological effects are reminiscent of increased LIMK activity 6 , 7 , 9 , 10 , and correlate well with the elevated phospho - cofilin levels observed in CIN D25N expressors ( Fig . 1b ) , corroborating the idea that phosphatase - dead CIN exerts a dominant - negative effect . The described cytoskeletal changes were observed with about five - fold overexpression of CIN WT or CIN D25N above endogenous protein levels , as quantified with CIN - specific antibodies ( CIN - WT , 4 . 27 - fold above endogenous CIN , n = 41 for transfected cells , compared with n = 48 for non - transfected cells ; CIN - D25N , 5 . 86 - fold above endogenous CIN , n = 23 for transfected cells , compared with n = 21 for non - transfected cells ) . Consistent with these observations , the reduction of endogenous CIN levels by siRNA elevated the total cellular F - actin content , and sta - bilized membrane protrusions and stress fibres ( Fig . 2b ) . Quantification of this effect suggested a 22 . 4 % increase in polymerized actin ( n = 31 for cells treated with CIN - specific siRNA oligonucleotides , compared with n = 47 for control siRNA - treated cells ) . This number may be an underestimate due to the high percentage of large , multinucleate cells observed after treatment with CIN siRNAs ( 34 . 7 % multinucleation compared with 2 . 6 % in control cells ; also see later ) . a b c d e f Cofilin CIN Merge / DNA Colocalization Figure 4 CIN is targeted to sites of cofilin - dependent actin dynamics during mitosis .

S1d ) . The specificity of these antibodies was confirmed using siRNA - mediated knockdown of CIN protein , which virtually abolished any immunoreactivity ( Fig . 2b ) . Endogenous CIN partially colocalized with F - actin ( Fig . 3a ) and cofilin ( Fig . 3b ) in membrane ruffles and lamellipodia , including regions where CIN and F - actin or cofilin are in close proximity but not overlapping . These observations are consistent with a regulatory role for CIN in cofilin - dependent actin cytoskeletal remodelling . Cofilin has a critical role in the massive cytoskeletal reorganization that is essential for mitotic progression and cytokinesis 1 . The marked effects of CIN on phospho - cofilin levels in mitosis ( Fig . 1b ) strongly suggested a function for CIN in cofilin regulation during cell division . We therefore examined the subcellular distribution of endogenous CIN ( Fig . 4a – f ) during mitosis . Throughout pro - metaphase and metaphase , CIN was mostly diffusely distributed in the cytosol , similar to cofi - lin ( Fig . 4a , b ) . During telophase , CIN and cofilin accumulated at the dynamic cell poles ( Fig . 4c ) , whereas during cytokinesis , CIN strongly colocalized with cofilin at the constricting cleavage furrow ( Fig . 4d ) and contractile ring ( Fig . 4e – f ) . As with cofilin , CIN was transiently targeted to the plasma membrane in later stages of cytokinesis ( Fig . 4f ) , and it also localized to the midbody ( see later ) and midbody matrix ( data not shown ) . Thus , the dynamic distribution of CIN during mitotic progres - sion precisely accompanies the transient cofilin localization to regions of actin dynamics , demonstrating that CIN has the appropriate locali - zation to function as an activator of cofilin - dependent actin dynamics in mitotic cells . Interestingly , analysis of the subcellular distribution of the overexpressed cofilin phosphatase slingshot in mitotic HeLa cells has revealed a distinct localization pattern 22 . Exogenous SSH is uni - formly associated with cortical F - actin throughout pro - metaphase and metaphase , and concentrates together with F - actin onto the cleavage furrow during telophase , whereas CIN shows limited colocalization with cortical F - actin at these stages ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S3a – c ) . However , CIN is present at the acto - myosin contractile ring in cytokinesis ( Fig . S3d – e ) . Thus , overexpressed SSH strongly associates with cortical F - actin during mitosis , whereas the localization of CIN more closely resembles cofilin distribution . These findings raise the possibility that CIN and SSH activities may be regulated in a spatially and temporally distinct manner . CIN regulates cofilin - dependent cell division In several model systems , altering the activity of cofilin results in the formation of multinucleate cells , probably owing to defects in cytoki - nesis 1 , 22 – 25 . In agreement with our biochemical analysis ( see Fig . 1b ) , CIN D25N elevated the cellular phospho - cofilin pool on a single - cell level , as quantified by measuring the average fluorescence intensities ( 122 . 8 % compared with control cells , n ≥ 24 cells per condition ) , and about 40 % of transfected cells had nuclear abnormalities ( Figs 5a and 6 ) . Conversely , cells transfected with CIN WT were characterized by reduced endogenous phospho - cofilin levels ( 54 . 9 % of control cells , n ≥ 26 cells per condition ) , and more than 15 % of CIN WT expressors became multinucleate after 48 h ( Figs 5a and 6 ) . Furthermore , the siRNA - mediated depletion of CIN resulted in the accumulation of roughly 35 % of multinucleate cells ( Fig . 5b and 6 ) and elevated phospho - cofilin levels during interphase and mitosis ( Fig . 7b ) . To more directly examine whether the effects of CIN on cell division were caused by interference with physiological cofilin signalling , CIN was co - expressed with well established cofilin regulatory proteins . This approach was chosen because expression of cofilin regulatory proteins into a CIN - knockdown background resulted in poor cell viability . The indicated phosphatase - active or phosphatase - inactive forms of CIN and SSH were functionally antagonistic , and CIN WT competed with the effects of LIMK1 on multinucleation ( Fig . 6 ) , most probably by normalizing phospho - cofilin levels ( see Fig . 1c ) . In addition , the co - expression of CIN D25N with cofilin WT or the non - phosphorylatable , constitutively active cofilin S3A significantly reduced the percentage of multinucleate cells , indicating that CIN D25N causes cell division defects by suppressing the reactivation of endogenous cofilin . Together , these results suggest that phosphoregulation of cofilin by CIN is important during mitotic progression and cytokinesis . To test this idea directly , the effects of CIN on the cofilin phosphoryla - tion profile were examined during distinct stages of mitotic progression 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 EGFP controlCofilin WT Cofilin S3A LIMK1 SSH1 WT SSH1 CS CIN WT CIN D25N Control siRNA CIN siRNA SSH1 siRNA CIN WT + LIMK1 CIN WT + SSH1 CS CIN D25N + cofilin WT CIN D25N + cofilin S3A CIN D25N + LIMK1 CIN D25N + CIN WT CIN D25N + SSH1 WT Percentage of multinucleate cells Figure 6 CIN induces cofilin - dependent multinucleation .

The cell - cycle state was followed in parallel by staining for tubulin and DNA , and the degradation of cyclin B1 , which starts in metaphase / anaphase 26 , was used as an additional biochemical marker for cell synchrony ( see Methods section ) . Control cells showed the characteristic phosphorylation / dephosphorylation profile of cofilin 21 , whereas expression of CIN WT markedly reduced cofilin phosphorylation throughout mitosis . CIN D25N elevated the phospho - cofilin pool above control levels at all time points . Furthermore , siRNA - mediated depletion of CIN not only increased the phospho - cofilin pool on a single - cell level in interphase cells ( 1 . 9 - fold increase above control cells , n = 29 for control siRNA - treated cells compared with n = 40 for CIN siRNA - treated cells ; also see Fig . 1d ) , but particularly during mitotic progression ( 2 . 3 – 2 . 8 - fold increase above control cells throughout mitosis , n = 27 for control siRNA - treated cells compared with n = 36 for CIN siRNA - treated cells ) ( Fig . 7b ) . Interestingly , biochemical analysis of the phospho - cofilin profile after siRNA - mediated depletion of CIN and / or SSH revealed differences in their temporal contribution to cofilin regulation during particular mitotic stages ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S4 ) . The duration of mitotic phases was measured with time - lapse micros - copy ( Fig . 8a ; also see Supplementary Information , Table 1 ) . Owing to poor viability of CIN - depleted cells in live imaging experiments , this analysis was conducted with CIN D25N expressors . Reflecting the effects on phospho - cofilin levels , CIN D25N expressors showed a prolonged progression through all phases of mitosis , including telophase / cytokinesis . More than 30 % of CIN D25N expressors initiated , but did not complete , cytokinesis and were characterized by cleavage - furrow regression , aborted or asymmetric cyto - kinesis . Only about 25 % of CIN D25N - expressing cells completed cytokinesis and separated into daughter cells during the time frame of observation ( up to 3 h ) , compared with roughly 90 % of control cells . Defects in mitotic progression and cytokinesis are thus likely to be the functional explanation for the accumulation of multinucleate cells after altered CIN activity . Finally , microscopic observation of synchronised , dividing cells depleted of CIN by RNAi and fixed 180 – 360 min after release from the mitotic block ( corresponding to cytokinesis / G1 phase in control cells ) had a b EGFP control EGFP − CIN WT EGFP − CIN D25N I n t e r p h a s e 0 45 90 120150180 Time ( min ) I n t e r p h a s e 0 45 90 120150180 Time ( min ) I n t e r p h a s e 0 45 90 120 150 180 Time ( min ) 180 160 140 120 100 80 60 40 20 0 P h o s p h o - c o f ili n ( m ea n f l u o r e s ce n ce i n t e n s i t y ) Control siRNA CIN siRNA I n t e r p h a s e P r o p h a s e M e t a p h a s e A n a p h a s e T e l o p h a s e / c y t o k i n e s i s Phospho - AC Cofilin GFP Cyclin B1 Figure 7 CIN controls cofilin phosphorylation during mitosis .

The time points at which the particular phases of mitosis were observed , starting with t = 0 for the last detectable metaphase figure , are indicated in minutes . ( n = 2 ) . ( b – q ) CIN depletion results in cytokinetic defects . HeLa cells were transfected with control or CIN - specific siRNA oligonucleotides , synchronised in mitosis and fixed and stained as indicated after 180 min , corresponding to cytokinesis in control cells ( b – e ) . Arrowheads in b and c denote midbody structure . CIN - depleted , dividing cells are characterized by persistent contractile rings ( f – i ) , aberrant accumulation of F - actin in remnants of the contractile ring ( j – m ) , or by contractile - ring disassembly without cell abscission , producing binucleate cells ( n – q ) . Arrowheads in f , j and n indicate the respective actin phenotypes . Images are confocal micrographs ( single slices of 0 . 54 µ m ) ; scale bar represents 10 µ m , ( n = 2 ) . print ncb1201 . indd 26 print ncb1201 . indd 26 8 / 12 / 04 2 : 15 : 46 pm 8 / 12 / 04 2 : 15 : 46 pm Nature PublishingGroup © 2005 NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 7 | NUMBER 1 | JANUARY 2005 27 A RT I C L E S the appearance of persistent contractile rings ( 25 . 3 % of cells ; Fig . 8f – i ) , aberrant accumulation of F - actin in remnants of the contractile ring ( 4 . 5 % of cells ; Fig . 8j – m ) , or cells in which the contractile ring appeared to have disassembled without ensuing cell abscission , producing binucleate cells ( 34 . 2 % ; Fig . 8n – q ) . In contrast , the majority of control cells at these time points were already in G1 , and 22 . 5 % of control cells had formed midbody structures and were undergoing cell abscission ( Fig . 8b – e ) . The observed phenotypes are similar to what has been reported for defective cofilin / ADF function in lower organisms 1 ; for example , defects in twinstar , the Drosophila cofilin homologue , result in failure of the contractile ring to disassemble properly at the end of telophase , accompanied by abnormal actin aggregates 25 . Thus , CIN is not only important for the gradual cofi - lin dephosphorylation and the accompanying massive actin cytoskeletal remodelling that is essential for mitotic progression , but is also involved in cytokinesis . Together , our results implicate CIN as an important regulator of cofilin - mediated actin dynamics during cell division . DISCUSSION We have biochemically isolated and characterized chronophin , a previ - ously uncharacterized and so far unique HAD - type protein phosphatase whose primary cellular protein substrates we identify as members of the actin - depolymerizing factor / cofilin family . Knowledge of the physiological substrates and cellular functions of HAD phosphatases is extremely limited , particularly in eukaryotic systems , and our evidence provides a demonstration of a physiological phospho - serine protein substrate for a mammalian HAD - type phosphatase . The identification of the HAD - type human phospho - serine phosphatase ( PSP ) involved in the l - serine biosynthetic pathway 15 , and the recent realization that the transcription factor eyes absent ( Eya ) contains HAD - phosphatase activity 16 – 18 , emphasize the biological importance of the largely unex - plored HAD - type hydrolase family . Our findings implicate chronophin as one of the long - sought - after cofilin phosphatases that may couple extracellular stimuli to the regu - lation of cytoskeletal dynamics . Elucidating the mechanisms by which CIN activity is regulated , and how this regulation is coordinated with signalling pathways that control cofilin phosphorylation , will provide important insights into the dynamics of cytoskeletal regulation ( see Supplementary Information ) . Although it is too early to understand the relative contributions of CIN and SSH to cofilin regulation in detail , our results suggest that both phosphatases are required , albeit in a spatio - temporally distinct manner , to control cofilin activity during cell divi - sion . The broad distribution of CIN suggests that it will be an important regulator of actin - and cofilin - dependent processes , including cell divi - sion , motility , polarity , and membrane dynamics , and its unconventional catalytic mechanism makes it a potentially unique therapeutic target for actin - related developmental disorders and diseases 5 . Intriguingly , UniGene and EST expression information indicates that CIN is overexpressed in neuroblastomas and germ cell seminomas , the most common solid tumours in children and young men . These malignant cancers are characterized by a high degree of aneuploidy 27 , 28 . Our demon - stration that altered CIN activity or loss of CIN function leads to cell divi - sion defects with a subsequent accumulation of aneuploid cells ( a hallmark of all tumours ) , together with the well documented dysregulation of cofilin in cancer ( reviewed in ref . 5 ) , implies an involvement of CIN in malignan - cies . It will be interesting to investigate a possible link between CIN activity , fidelity of cell division , and tumour initiation and progression . Note added in proof : While our work on CIN was in progress , this previ - ously uncharacterized protein was reported to dephosphorylate vitamin B6 ( ref . 31 ) . Consistent with our own observations , the authors determined either negligible or no activity of the purified or recombinant phosphatase towards various nucleotides , phospho - amino acids or phosphoglycolate , and a slow hydrolysis of p - NPP , supporting our results that CIN accepts only a very limited spectrum of substrates . METHODS DNA constructs . Full - length human chronophin was obtained from the I . M . A . G . E . consortium , or reverse - transcribed from total HeLa cell RNA using Superscript RNase H – reverse transcriptase and oligo dT primers ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) . CIN was subcloned into pCMV6m ( myc – CIN ) , pcDNA3 ( EGFP – CIN ) , pGEX - 4T3 ( GST – CIN ) or pTrc - A ( 6×His – CIN ) . All CIN constructs were tagged at the N terminus . Because of its high G – C content ( ~ 73 % ) , CIN cloning was performed with the Advantage - GC cDNA PCR kit ( Clontech , Palo Alto , CA ) . Human SSH1L WT and SSH1L CS constructs in pcDNA3 . 1 / myc – His ( + ) were a gift from T . Uemura ( Kyoto , Japan ) . LIMK constructs were provided by G . Gill ( San Diego , CA ) . Full - length LIMK constructs were in pcDNA - 3 and LIMK - Kd3 constructs were in pcDNA - 3M . Recombinant protein purification . For the purification of recombinant chronophin , 6×His – CIN was transformed into BL21 ( DE3 ) pLysS cells ( Invitrogen ) , expressed for 4 h at 37 °C after induction with 1 mM isopropylthiogalactoside ( IPTG ) , and purified under native conditions by standard affinity chromatogra - phy on a nickel - NTA matrix ( Qiagen , Valencia , CA ) . Purified CIN was stored at – 80 °C in 40 mM triethanolamine , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 002 % Triton X - 100 and 20 % glycerol at pH 7 . 4 . GST – CIN was purified from inclusion bodies . Bacteria were grown at 30 °C until A 600 reached 0 . 6 – 0 . 8 , and protein expression was induced with IPTG ( 0 . 2 mM ) for 14 h at room temperature . Bacterial pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer ( 50 mM Hepes , 500 mM NaCl , 1 mM phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride ( PMSF ) , 5 mM dithiothreitol ( DTT ) and 0 . 35 mg ml – 1 lysozyme , at pH 7 . 5 ) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature . Triton X - 100 was added to a final concentration of 1 % ( v / v ) , and bacteria were sonicated with 30 - s bursts until the solution cleared . DNase I was added to a final concentration of 20 µ g ml – 1 , and lysates were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C . Cellular debris was removed by centrifu - gation ( 4 , 000 g , 15 min , 4 °C ) , and inclusion bodies were pelleted by high - speed centrifugation ( 30 , 000 g , 30 min , 4 °C ) . The resulting precipitate was washed twice in 1 % Triton X - 100 / PBS ( 30 , 000 g , 30 min , 4 °C ) . Inclusion bodies were solubilized in a small volume of denaturation buffer ( 50 mM Hepes , 6 M guanidinium - HCl and 25 mM DTT at pH 7 . 5 ) , and the remaining insoluble material was removed by centrifugation ( 100 , 000 g , 10 min , 4 °C ) . The protein solution was adjusted to a concentration of about 1 mg ml – 1 with denaturation buffer , and quickly diluted into cold folding buffer ( 50 mM Hepes , 200 mM NaCl , 1 mM DTT , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM MnCl 2 and 1 M NDSB - 201 ( Calbiochem , San Diego , CA ) at pH 7 . 5 ) to a maximum final concentration of 0 . 05 – 0 . 1 mg ml – 1 under vigorous stirring . The mixture was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C , and dialysed against phosphatase buffer ( 50 mM Hepes , 10 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM MnCl 2 and 0 . 2 mM DTT at pH 7 . 5 ) , and GST – CIN was isolated by standard glutathione - sepharose chromatography . Recombinant Xenopus ADF / cofilin in pET16 was provided by J . Bamburg , and purified as described for ADF to > 99 % homogeneity 29 . Generation of CIN - specific antibodies . Full - length CIN fused to GST was used as an immunogen in New Zealand white rabbits after isolation from inclusion bodies ( as described above ) , followed by standard glutathione - sepharose chroma - tography and elution from glutathione beads . Affinity purified anti - CIN antibod - ies were prepared by chromatography over purified 6×His – CIN immobilized on CNBr - activated Sepharose ( Amersham , Piscataway , NJ ) . To specifically deplete anti - CIN antibodies , affinity purified anti - CIN was incubated three times for 2 h at 4 °C under rotation with myc – CIN immunoprecipitates ( using polyclonal anti - myc antibodies from UBI , Lake Placid , NY ) or with GST – CIN immobilized on beads . For control purposes , affinity purified anti - CIN was mock - depleted with beads alone , using the same conditions . print ncb1201 . indd 27 print ncb1201 . indd 27 8 / 12 / 04 2 : 15 : 48 pm 8 / 12 / 04 2 : 15 : 48 pm Nature PublishingGroup © 2005 28 NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 7 | NUMBER 1 | JANUARY 2005 A RT I C L E S Kinase and phosphatase assays . In vitro phosphatase assays using 32 P - labelled , Ser - 3 - phosphorylated Xenopus ADF / cofilin , GST – Pak1 , Pak1 - phosphorylated myelin basic protein or Pak1 - phosphorylated LIMK1 - Kd3 were performed as described 29 . Phosphatase activity toward p - NPP ( Calbiochem ) was assayed in 96 - well microtitre plates following the manufacturer’s recommendations . After addition of 100 µ l of the substrate , reactions were allowed to proceed for 30 min at 37 °C , and stopped by the addition of 3 N NaOH . The absorbance of p - nitrophenol was measured at 405 nm with a plate reader . Purified PP2A , included as a control , was purchased from UBI . For peptide assays , reaction mixtures with 100 µ M of phosphopeptides ( tyro - sine and serine / threonine phosphatase assay system ; Promega , Madison , WI ) were reacted with 6×His – CIN WT ( 5 µ g ) or PP2A ( 0 . 1 U ; positive control ) at pH 7 . 5 and pH 5 . 5 , incubated at 30 °C for 60 min , and quenched by the addition of mala - chite green reagent . The colour was allowed to develop for 30 min , and released phosphate was determined by measuring A 650 and extrapolating the values to a phosphate standard curve . An anti - phospho - LIMK1 ( Thr 508 ) / LIMK2 ( Thr 505 ) antibody ( Cell Signalling Technology , Beverly , MA ) was used to test for LIMK dephosphorylation on the activation - site threonine . Cell transfection , immunofluorescence and microscopic observation . HeLa cells were grown in six - well plates and transfected using 0 . 1 – 0 . 5 µ g of vector DNA or myc - or EGFP - tagged CIN with Lipofectamine Plus reagent ( Invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations . For analysis of whole - cell lysates , HeLa cells were lysed 18 h after transfection in lysis buffer ( 1 % NP - 40 , 50 mM NaCl , 30 mM triethanolamine , 5 mM EGTA , 50 mM NaF , 10 µg ml – 1 apro - tinin , 10 µg ml – 1 leupeptin , 1 mM pepstatin , 1 mM PMSF , 100 nM okadaic acid and 10 nM calyculin A ) . Endogenously expressed CIN was detected with affinity purified anti - CIN antibodies at a dilution of 1 : 100 . For microscopic observations , HeLa cells were grown on glass coverslips in 35 - mm dishes in DMEM containing 8 % fetal calf serum and transfected as described above . To determine the effect of CIN on multinucleation , cells were transfected with 0 . 5 µ g of DNA , and fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde 48 h after transfection . Cells were processed for immunofluorescence staining as described 29 . Only those cells that co - expressed the proteins of interest at comparable levels ( similar to cells expressing the respective proteins alone ) were scored in a blind fashion . For the purpose of this study , multinucleate cells were defined as cells with more than one nucleus , including lobulated - , macro - and micronuclei . Nuclei were stained with DAPI ( Sigma , St Louis , MO ) . To determine the localization of endogenous CIN , HeLa cells were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde and processed as described 29 . Fixation with methanol gave essentially the same results . Affinity purified anti - CIN antibodies were used at a dilution of 1 : 25 for immunostaining . Affinity purified , polyclonal antibodies specific for Ser - 3 - phosphorylated ADF / cofilin ( AC ) and affinity purified , polyclonal anti - ADF antibodies were provided by J . Bamburg . Monoclonal anti - myc antibodies were generated in the Scripps Antibody Core Facility , polyclonal anti - cofilin antibodies were from Cytoskeleton Inc . ( Denver , CO ) , and the monoclonal anti - cofilin antibody D17D4 ( ref . 30 ) was a gift to J . B . from Y . Samstag ( Heidelberg , Germany ) . Alexa - phalloidin was purchased from Molecular Probes ( Eugene , OR ) . Microtubules were visualized by staining for α - tubulin with monoclonal antibody DM1A ( Sigma ) . Confocal images were obtained on a Bio - Rad MRC1024 confocal system , attached to a Zeiss Axiovert S100TV microscope , with a ×63 oil objective . Confocal slice thickness was 0 . 54 µ m . Colocalization analysis was performed using the software Image J ( version 1 . 31 ) . Colocalized data points were deter - mined based on a Pearson’s correlation coefficient ≥ 0 . 7 , and are shown as white overlays ( Fig . 3 and Fig . 4 ) . Live - cell imaging of dividing cells was performed in a Dvorak chamber on an Olympus IX70 microscope equipped with a CCD camera ( Roper Scientific , Trenton , NJ ) , using a ×20 objective with phase - contrast optics . Frames were taken every 2 min . Quantification of fluorescence intensities was performed using MetaMorph software , version 6 . 1 ( Universal Imaging Corporation , Downington , PA ) . RNA interference . A CIN - directed pool of four individual siRNA duplex oligo - nucleotides ( SMARTpool reagent ) was selected according to the SMARTselection algorithm and purchased from Dharmacon RNA Technologies ( Lafayette , CO ) . SMARTpools were M - 017120 - 00 for human CIN ( sequence of sense strands , 5 ′ - GCGCCGUGCUUGUGGGCUA - 3 ′ ; 5 ′ - UAGAAGAGGCCCAGGCCUA - 3 ′ ; 5 ′ - CGGCUCUGUUUGUGAGCAA - 3 ′ ; and 5 ′ - GCACGCUUAUGGUGGGUGA - 3 ′ ) , and M - 008083 - 00 for human SSH1L ( sequence of sense strands , 5 ′ - CCAAAGAGAUUCGUAAUGA - 3 ′ ; 5 ′ - GGAGGAUGAUGCUAUAUUU - 3 ′ ; 5 ′ - CGAAGAAGAUCGAAAAUUA - 3 ′ ; and 5 ′ - GAGUGAAUCUUCCUUCUUG - 3 ′ ) . As a control for potential off - target effects , a pool of four siCON - TROL non - targeting siRNAs was used ( D - 001206 - 13 , non - Specific Control Duplexes – XIII . Duplex 1 , 5 ′ - AUGAACGUGAAUUGCUCAA - 3 ′ ; Duplex 2 , 5 ′ - UAAGGCUAUGAAGAGAUAC - 3 ′ ; Duplex 3 , 5 ′ - AUGUAUUGGCCUGUAUUAG - 3 ′ ; and Duplex 4 , 5 ′ - UAGCGACUAAACACAUCAA - 3 ′ ) . All the siRNAs listed above have UU as 3 ′ overhangs on each strand and 5 ′ phosphate on the antisense strand only . siRNA pools were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen ) , according to the manufacturer’s recommendations . CIN - or SSH1 - specific siRNAs were used at final concentrations of 2 or 10 nM , respectively , and control siRNAs were used at the corresponding final concentrations . In some cases , lamin A / C - specific siRNAs were used at a final concentration of 100 nM . Roughly 50 , 000 HeLa cells grown per well of a 12 - well plate were transfected with 1 µ l of Lipofectamine 2000 . Cells were grown for 48 h , and processed for immunofluorescence or biochemical analysis . Cell synchronization . HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium ( DMEM ) supplemented with 8 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ; complete medium ) . To arrest cells at mitosis , the cultures were synchronized with noco - dazole after a single thymidine block . Briefly , cells were maintained in complete medium with 2 mM thymidine ( Sigma ) for 24 h , released for 6 – 8 h in fresh com - plete medium , and cultured for a further 6 h in fresh complete medium in the presence of 100 ng ml – 1 nocodazole ( Sigma ) . Mitotic cells that rounded up and adhered weakly to the culture dish were collected by mechanical shake - off , and attached interphase cells were harvested by scraping . Cells were washed exten - sively , and plated on poly - l - lysine coated coverslips in complete medium , with the exception of interphase cells , which were lysed immediately . Mitotic cells were allowed to progress through mitosis / cytokinesis for the indicated times . Cells were lysed in PBS containing 1 % Triton X - 100 , 2 % SDS , 5 mM EGTA , and protease - and phosphatase - inhibitor cocktails . In addition to determining cyclin B1 - degradation ( with anti - cyclin - B1 polyclonal antibodies , H433 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA ) , cell synchrony was assessed by staining for tubu - lin and DNA with anti - α - tubulin antibodies ( DM1A ) and DAPI , respectively . At 0 min , 95 % of control cells were in prometaphase ; at 45 min , 65 % were in met - aphase ( 20 % in prometaphase , 5 % in anaphase ) ; at 90 min , 85 % were in telophase and 10 % in anaphase ; and at 3 h , 95 % were in G1 phase .

Image analysis was performed with the software PD - Quest , which normalises phosphoprotein signals to relative differences in protein abundance . The two proteins that are predominantly dephosphorylated upon CIN expression and that were identified by the software as highly significant are indicated by arrows . The insets in the upper panel are enlarged regions of the spots indicated by arrows . The bottom panel shows the corresponding image analysis . Twelve protein spots showed a one - fold decrease in phosphosignals upon CIN ( WT ) expression , as indicated by the yellow marks . Only the spots denoted by arrows were scored as highly significant ( both yellow and blue marks ) and showed a ~ three - fold decrease in phosphosignals .

NATURE . COM / NATURECELLBIOLOGY 3 Figure S3 CIN is localises to sites of cofilin - dependent actin dynamics during mitosis . Shown is the localisation of CIN and F - actin in a panel of mitotic HeLa cells at different stages of cell division . CIN partially co - localises with cortical F - actin during ( pro ) metaphase ( a , b ) and telophase ( c ) , and is found together with F - actin in the ingressing contractile ring ( arrows in d , e ) . Co - localised data points ( Pearson’s correlation coefficient ≥ 0 . 7 ) were calculated as described in Methods , and are shown as white overlays . F - actin was stained with phalloidin , endogenous CIN was visualized with affinity - purified CIN - specific antibodies , and DNA was stained with To - Pro 3 ( as in Fig . 4 ) . Scale bars represent 10 μ m ; slice thickness is 0 . 54 μ m ; n = 3 . © 2005 Nature Publishing Group S U P P L E M E N TA RY I N F O R M AT I O N 4 WWW . NATURE . COM / NATURECELLBIOLOGY Figure S4 Biochemical analysis of the phosphocofilin profile upon siRNA - mediated depletion of CIN and / or SSH reveals differences in their temporal contribution to cofilin regulation during particular mitotic stages . ( a ) CIN depletion increased phosphocofilin levels from 45 - 180 min post nocodazole release , corresponding to ( pro ) metaphase through telophase / cytokinesis . The relatively weak effect of CIN depletion on phosphocofilin levels in this biochemical analysis may be due to decreased cell viability upon CIN knockdown and selection of insufficiently CIN - depleted cells ( compare to Fig . 7b ) . In contrast , SSH knockdown predominantly elevated phosphocofilin in late cytokinesis ( 360 min ) , in agreement with published observations 22 . These authors have shown that the phosphatase activity of SSH decreases from ( pro ) metaphase through telophase , and again reaches interphase levels during late cytokinesis . Consistent with their findings and our results , depletion of both CIN and SSH elevated the phosphocofilin pool throughout mitotic progression , and CIN knockdown enhanced the effect of SSH depletion on phosphocofilin levels during cytokinesis ( n = 2 experiments ) . ( b ) siRNA - mediated depletion of SSH1 . HeLa cells were transfected with SSH1 - specific or lamin A / C - specific siRNA oligonucleotides , and RT - PCR analysis was performed at the indicated time points . β - actin controls were included to confirm comparable loading .

After nocodazole washout , cells were imaged with phase contrast optics for up to 3 hrs on a heated stage . The expression of CIN ( D25N ) delays the progression through all mitotic stages including cytokinesis . CIN ( WT ) expressors appear to ingress their cleavage furrows more rapidly , but only few cells expressing CIN ( D25N ) or CIN ( WT ) undergo midbody formation and cell abscission . Transition times are in minutes , and mitotic phases were assessed morphologically . “Metaphase” signifies the last detectable equatorial chromosome alignment . “Midbody formation” was here defined as the first detectable intercellular bridge formation ; n . d . : not detectable ; n indicates the number of cells that could be scored in the respective phases ( n = 2 ) . © 2005 Nature Publishing Group S U P P L E M E N TA RY I N F O R M AT I O N WWW . NATURE . COM / NATURECELLBIOLOGY 5 SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL Further evidence for the HAD - phosphatase nature of CIN was obtained from its susceptibility profile to inhibitors ( not shown ) . CIN was insensitive to inhibitors of classical thiol - based serine / threonine phosphatases , but was effectively blocked by molybdate and orthovana - date , which act as phosphate analogs . NaF , which inactivates magne - sium - dependent phosphatases , as well as Zn 2 + , Ca 2 + and Mn 2 + , which compete with Mg 2 + , strongly inhibited CIN , as did the Mg 2 + - chelator EDTA . Thus , the high extent of conservation of the active - site residues among CIN orthologs across evolution , the critical role of the initial aspartate in motif I for catalysis , and the observed inhibitor profile suggest that CIN is a Mg 2 + - dependent HAD - type phospho - aspartate transferase . Purified CIN ( WT ) and CIN ( D25N ) co - sedimented with F - actin , further substantiating the observed localisation to actin - rich structures ( data not shown ) . Dephosphorylated cofilin disassembles F - actin via depolymerisation and severing , and filament severing generates a large number of free barbed ends available for the rapid growth of new actin polymers 1 . Consequently , activating cofilin through CIN may result in a net increase of F - actin at sites of cytoskeletal remodelling , such as the dendritic brush of membrane ruffles ( see discussion of Fig . 2a ) . The biochemical quantitation of the steady - state amounts of G - and F - actin was in good agreement with this interpretation and with the observed short - term cytoskeletal effects : In two independent experiments , we measured mean G / F - actin ratios of 1 . 3±0 . 2 for EGFP - express - ing control cells ; 1 . 02±0 . 2 for CIN ( WT ) expressors ; and 0 . 75±0 . 1 for CIN ( D25N ) expressors , and similar values were found for SSH1L ( WT ) and catalytically inactive SSH1L ( CS ) ( data not shown ) . Thus , CIN evokes the cytoskeletal phenotypes expected of a physiological cofilin phosphatase involved in actin filament turnover . Scansite database searches indicate that both CIN and SSH harbour binding motifs for the p85 subunit of phosphoinositide 3 - kinase , potentially linking them to stimulus - induced phospholipid signalling 2 . However , in contrast to SSH1 , CIN contains additional polyproline domains predicted to interact with the SH3 domain of phospholipase C γ ( PLC γ ) . This molecular interaction may couple CIN to PLC γ - dependent protein kinase C ( PKC ) activation and inositol 1 , 4 , 5 - tri - sphosphate - induced Ca 2 + - release from intracellular stores . Indeed , our preliminary data show that CIN co - immunoprecipitates with endog - enous p85 and PLC γ ( A . G . and G . M . B . , unpublished observations ) , strongly suppporting the idea that CIN is integrated in these impor - tant signalling pathways regulating cofilin phosphocycling . Thus , Chronophin may be responsible both for the Ca 2 + - dependent and the Ca 2 + - independent , PKC - mediated cofilin activation and therefore rep - resent the elusive , unconventional cofilin phosphatase whose existence was long suggested in the published literature . SUPPLEMENTARY METHODS Northern blot , RT - PCR , and Western blot analysis . Chronophin and Slingshot probes ( listed below ) were hybridised to commercial human adult multiple tis - sue Northern Blots ( Clontech ) according to the manufacturer’s recommenda - tions with modifications , as described 3 , and β - actin controls were included to compare the amounts of RNA . CIN and SSH expression was further examined using the cDNA preparations provided in the human MTC Panel I ( BD Biosciences ) . RT - PCR ( 30 - 35 cycles ) was performed with the following gene - specific primers : CIN sense primer : ( 5’GTCCTGTTCGACTGTGACGG3’ ) ; CIN antisense primer : ( 5’GGCCAAAGAGGATGTCGGTC3’ ) ; SSH1L sense primer : ( ATTGGGATGGTTCTCCGACT ) ; SSH1L antisense primer : ( GTCCATCTGTCCCAAGATAAG ) . For western blot analysis , HeLa cells or adult mouse tissues were lysed in a buffer containing 2 % SDS , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 5 mM EGTA , 50 mM NaF , 10 µg / ml aprotinin , 10 µg / ml leupeptin , 1 mM pepstatin , 1 mM PMSF , 100 nM oka - daic acid and 10 nM calyculin A in phosphate buffered saline . Phosphatase blot overlay assays . For protein tyrosine phosphatase blot over - lay assays , HeLa cells were seeded into six - well plates , grown to 80 % confluence in DMEM / 8 % fetal calf serum , and stimulated for 15 min at 37 °C with 100 µ M pervanadate ( 1 : 1 mixture of 100 mM orthovanadate and 30 % H 2 O 2 ) . Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 1 % NP - 40 , 50 mM NaCl , 30 mM triethanolamine , 5 mM EGTA , 50 mM NaF , and protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail ( pH 7 . 8 ) , subjected to SDS - PAGE , and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes . Membranes were incubated for 1 hr at 37 °C with His 6 - CIN or CIP ( Boehringer Mannheim ) diluted in assay buffer ( 37 mM triethanolamine , 4 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 5 % non - fat dry milk ) ( as indicated in Supplementary Information , Fig . S2a online ) . Phosphotyrosyl containing proteins were detected with the monoclonal antibody 4G10 ( UBI ) . Analysis of cellular CIN substrates . HeLa cells were transfected with EGFP or EGFP - CIN ( WT ) , and synchronised in mitosis as described above . After mitotic shake - off , cells were washed three times in wash buffer ( 10 mM Tris , pH 7 . 0 , 250 mM sucrose ) , and whole cell extracts were prepared by lysis in modified O’Farrell’s buffer ( 9 M urea , 1 % DTT , 4 % CHAPS , 0 . 2 % ampholytes , 1 mM PMSF , 10 µg / ml leupeptin , 1 mM pepstatin , 100 nM okadaic acid and 10 nM calyculin A ) . Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation ( 10 , 000 x g , 10 min ) , and 360 µ g of protein were subjected to isoelectric focussing on 18 cm strips with pH 3 - 10 non - linear gradients . Separation in the second dimension was performed on 12 % Duracryl Tricine gels ( Genomic Solutions ) . Phosphoproteins were detected with the fluorescent Pro - Q diamond phospho - protein gel stain , and total proteins were visualised with the quantitative , fluo - rescent SYPRO Ruby protein gel stain ( both from Molecular Probes ) , according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Stained gels were imaged with a BioRad VersaDoc Model 1000 , using 520 long pass UV transillumination , and analysed using the BioRad PDQuest software , version 7 . 1 . 1 . Total protein and phospho - protein spot intensities were quantitated using PDQuest , and relative changes in phosphoprotein signals were normalised to the corresponding protein spot abundance in the EGFP - control gel . Biochemical measurement of G / F - actin ratios , actin co - sedimentation . The relative steady - state amounts of G - and F - actin in CIN ( WT ) , CIN ( D25N ) and control transfected HeLa cells were determined after 18 hrs of expression by partitioning into Triton X - 100 soluble ( G - actin ) and Triton X - 100 insoluble ( F - actin ) pools from live cells 4 . The different cellular pools and a purified actin con - trol ( Cytoskeleton Inc . ) were subjected to SDS - PAGE , stained with Coomassie Blue , and the densities of actin bands was quantitated by densitometry . Co - sedi - mentation of purified His 6 - CIN with non - muscle actin was assayed by F - actin spin - down using the actin binding kit from Cytoskeleton Inc . SUPPLEMENTARY REFERENCES 1 .
