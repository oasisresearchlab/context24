Expressed ubiquitously in the body , the four FoxO isoforms share in common the amino DNA - binding domain , known as ‘forkhead box’ domain . They mediate the inhibitory action of insulin or insulin - like growth factor on key functions involved in cell metabolism , growth , differentiation , oxidative stress , senescence , autophagy and aging . Genetic mutations in FoxO genes or abnormal expression of FoxO proteins are associated with metabolic disease , cancer or altered lifespan in humans and animals . Of the FoxO family , FoxO6 is the least characterized member and is shown to play pivotal roles in the liver , skeletal muscle and brain . Altered FoxO6 expression is associated with the pathogenesis of insulin resistance , dietary obesity and type 2 diabetes and risk of neurodegeneration disease . FoxO6 is evolutionally divergent from other FoxO isoforms . FoxO6 mediates insulin action on target genes in a mechanism that is fundamentally different from other FoxO members . Here , we focus our review on the role of FoxO6 , in contrast with other FoxO isoforms , in health and disease . We review the distinctive mechanism by which FoxO6 integrates insulin signaling to hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism . We highlight the importance of FoxO6 dysregulation in the dual pathogenesis of fasting hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia in diabetes . We review the role of FoxO6 in memory consolidation and its contribution to neurodegeneration disease and aging . We discuss the potential therapeutic option of pharmacological FoxO6 inhibition for improving glucose and lipid metabolism in diabetes . The forkhead box O family The forkhead box O ( FoxO ) family consists of FoxO1 ( FKHR ) , FoxO3 ( FKHRL1 ) , FoxO4 ( AFX ) and FoxO6 proteins , each encoded by a distinct gene in mammalian cells . These four isoforms share a common structural motif , namely the ‘forkhead box’ or ‘winged helix’ domain that is responsible for binding to chromatin DNA in the nucleus of cells ( Accili & Arden 2004 ) . FoxO proteins act as nuclear transcription factors that mediate the inhibitory action of insulin or insulin - like growth factor ( IGF - 1 ) on key functions in diverse pathways including cell metabolism , proliferation , differentiation , oxidative stress , cell survival and senescence , autophagy and aging in mammals ( Accili & Arden 2004 ) . As a result , genetic mutations in FoxO genes or altered expression of FoxO proteins are associated with diseases including diabetes and cancer or with reduced lifespan in mammals . This latter aspect is exemplified by the illustration of role of the FoxO ortholog Daf16 in Caenorhabditis elegans 233 2 Correspondence should be addressed to H H Dong Email dongh @ pitt . edu Key Words f FoxO1 f FoxO3 f FoxO4 f FoxO6 f glucose metabolism f lipid metabolism f insulin signaling f obesity f diabetes Journal of Endocrinology ( 2017 ) 233 , R67 – R79 Downloaded from Bioscientifica . com at 06 / 06 / 2019 01 : 01 : 56AM via free access Review R68 FoxO in glucose and lipid metabolism DOI : 10 . 1530 / JOE - 17 - 0002 J ou r n a l o f E ndo c r i no l og y s lee and h h dong http : / / joe . endocrinology - journals . org © 2017 Society for Endocrinology Printed in Great Britain Published by Bioscientifica Ltd . 233 : 2 ( Lee et al . 2003 , Hwangbo et al . 2004 ) . Daf16 mediates the effect of insulin - like receptor Daf - 2 on cellular anti - oxidative functions ( Essers et al . 2005 , Mueller et al . 2014 ) . Increased Daf16 expression , resulting from attenuated insulin - like signaling or increased oxidative stress , promotes anti - oxidative function , contributing to the lifespan extension in Caenorhabditis elegans ( Lee et al . 2003 ) . Likewise , the FoxO1 ortholog dFoxO signaling through insulin - like receptor dInR contributes to the regulation of longevity in Drosophila melanogaster ( Hwangbo et al . 2004 ) . Among the four FoxO isoforms in mammalian cells , FoxO6 remains the least characterized member . FoxO6 has garnered less interest , due in part to the misconception that FoxO6 expression is confined in the brain ( Jacobs et al . 2003 ) . Subsequent research has rectified this misconception , showing that FoxO6 is expressed in central and peripheral tissues including the liver , intestine , lung , kidney , muscle and adipose tissues , a broad tissue distribution that is characteristic of other FoxO isoforms in mammals ( Kim et al . 2011 ) . Recent studies indicate that FoxO6 plays important roles in integrating insulin signaling to glucose and lipid metabolism . However , unlike other FoxO isoforms , FoxO6 mediates insulin action on target gene expression in cells via a distinct mechanism that is fundamentally different from the FoxO family ( Kim et al . 2011 ) . This is consistent with the distinctive feature of FoxO6 protein ( Fig . 1 ) . FoxO6 expression becomes deregulated in metabolic disease . Furthermore , altered FoxO6 expression in the brain is associated with impaired cognitive function in mice . In this article , we provide a comprehensive review on the role of FoxO6 in insulin action and carbohydrate metabolism in the liver . We provide mechanistic insight into the distinct mechanism by which insulin differentially modulates the transcriptional activity of FoxO6 , as opposed to other members in the FoxO family . We discuss how FoxO6 deregulation in the liver contributes to the development of metabolic abnormalities in animal models with obesity and type 2 diabetes . We also review nascent evidence that FoxO6 plays important roles in neuronal cells with its potential contribution to neurodegeneration and longevity . FoxO integration of insulin signaling to target gene expression FoxO proteins or FoxO orthologs ( Daf16 and dFoxO ) are the class of transcrption factors that mediates the inhibitory action of insulin or insulin - like growth factor ( IGF - 1 ) on target genes in cells . It is well characterized that insulin ( or IGF - 1 ) exerts its inhibitory effect on gene expression via a highly conserved sequence ( TG / ATTTT / G ) , known as the ‘insulin responsive element’ ( IRE ) in target promoters ( Accili & Arden 2004 ) . In response to attenuated insulin ( or IGF - 1 ) signaling , FoxO proteins or FoxO orthologs become active in the nucleus and bind as trans - activators to the IRE DNA motif within target gene promoters to stimulate target gene expression . In keeping with this action , FoxO proteins or FoxO orthologs possess the amino forkhead box domain for binding to chromatin DNA and the carboxyl transactivation domain for enhancing promoter activity . Crystallographic studies reveal that FoxO proteins bind as monomers to chromatin DNA ( Brent et al . 2008 ) . In response to increased insulin ( or IGF - 1 ) signaling , FoxO proteins or FoxO orthologs undergo insulin - mediated phosphorylation and translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm , resulting in the inhibition of target gene expression ( Accili & Arden 2004 ) . This phosphorylation - dependent nucleocytoplasmic trafficking serves as an effective mechanism by which insulin ( or IGF - 1 ) regulates FoxO transcriptional activity in cells . All members of the FoxO family , with the exception of FoxO6 , undergo insulin - dependent phosphorylation and nuclear exclusion . Failure in insulin ( or IGF - 1 ) - mediated FoxO phosphorylation results in FoxO permanent nuclear localization , accounting for unchecked FoxO activity and constitutive expression of target genes , an anomaly that is associated with defective insulin ( or IGF - 1 ) signaling in the pathogenesis of diseases including cancer and diabetes ( Accili & Arden 2004 , Altomonte et al . 2004 , Barthel et al . 2005 , Matsumoto et al . 2006 , Qu et al . 2006 , Sparks & Dong 2009 , Cifarelli et al . 2012 ) . Figure 1 Schematic depiction of the mouse FoxO6 protein . FoxO6 is characterized by its amino DNA - binding and carboxyl trans - activation domains . Within the DNA - binding domain are the bipartite nuclear localization signal ( NLS ) , consensus 14 - 3 - 3 protein - binding motif and two conserved Akt / PKB phosphorylation sites T26 and S184 . Amino acid residues K173 , K176 , K190 , K202 and K229 denote five distinct acetylation sites that are conserved across the species .

Using FoxO1 as an example , Kim and coworkers ( Kim et al . 2011 ) show that FoxO1 is capable of interacting with chromosome region maintenance 1 ( CRM - 1 ) , also known as exportin - 1 that is responsible for binding to the nuclear export signal ( NES ) of a cargo protein and transporting the cargo protein from the nucleus to cytoplasm ( Dong et al . 2009 , Monecke et al . 2009 ) . Consistent with this observation is the presence of a highly conserved NES motif in the carboxyl domain of FoxO1 . Immunocytochemistry reveals that FoxO1 and CRM - 1 are co - localized in the nucleus of cultured hepatocytes . In response to insulin , FoxO1 in complex with CRM - 1 is translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm . This insulin - dependent FoxO1 and CRM - 1 translocation is abrogated by leptomycin B , an agent that binds specifically to CRM - 1 and disables its cargo - trafficking activity ( Kim et al . 2011 ) . These results characterize CRM - 1 as a mediator in facilitating insulin - dependent FoxO1 subcellular redistribution . A prevailing view is that all FoxO proteins including its orthologs dFoxO and Daf16 , except for FoxO6 , undergo insulin ( or IGF - 1 ) - mediated nucleocytoplasmic trafficking in cells . FoxO integration of oxidative stress to cell survival FoxO proteins and orthologs ( dFoxO and Daf16 ) play important roles in protecting cells from oxidative stress . This cytoprotective effect is attributable to FoxO anti - oxidative function . In response to oxidative stress , FoxO proteins undergo translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus , contributing to increased FoxO activity in promoting FoxO target genes encoding anti - oxidative enzymes such as manganese superoxide dismutase ( MnSOD ) expression , catalase ( CAT ) and glutathione peroxidase ( GPX ) . This effect contributes to the preservation of cell survival and function in the face of oxidative stress ( Kops et al . 2002 ) . However , chronic oxidative stress is also associated with cellular apoptosis . Lehtinen and coworkers show that the oxidative stress - regulated mammalian sterile 20 - like kinas - 1 ( MST1 ) is activated in neuronal cells ( Lehtinen et al . 2006 ) . Activated MST1 kinases phosphorylate FoxO3 at a conserved site Ser 207 within FoxO3 forkhead box domain . The resulting effect disrupts FoxO3 interaction with 14 - 3 - 3 proteins and promotes FoxO3 nuclear translocation and stimulates apoptotic gene expression , thereby inducing death in neurons ( Lehtinen et al . 2006 ) . These data characterize MST1 as a significant upstream regulator of FoxO activity and cell surivival in response to oxidative stress . It is noteworthy that increased MST1 activity , resulting from oxidative stress , also regulates the p38 AMPK and c - Jun N - terminal kinase ( JNK ) pathway ( Graves et al . 1998 ) . Essers and coworkers demonstrate that the small GTPase Ral is activated in cells in the presene of H 2 O 2 - induced oxidative stress , and this results in JNK - dependent phosphorylation of FoxO4 on Thr - 447 and Thr - 451 ( Essers et al . 2004 ) . This signaling pathway is also employed by tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF - α ) to activate FoxO4 activity in response to inflammation . As a result , JNK - mediated phosphorylation of FoxO4 promotes its nuclear translocation and enhances its transcriptional activity in driving the expression of anti - oxidative functions including MnSOD , CAT and GPX , protecting mammalian cells from oxidative damage ( Essers et al . 2004 ) . Interestingly , such an anti - oxidative function of FoxO1 is conserved from C . elegans to mammals . Further physiological underpinning for the cytoprotective role of FoxO in defending oxidative stress derives from a number of significant studies in pancreatic β - cells : a cell type that is associated with extremely low expression of anti - oxidative enzymes . This renders β - cells more vulnerable to oxidative stress , accounting in part for β - cell dysfunction in diabetes . In this context , Zhang and coworkers show that FoxO1 stimulates β - cell expression of Sod1 , catalase ( Cat ) and glutathione peroxidase 1 ( Gpx1 ) , contributing to improved β - cell survival and function in the presence of oxidative stress ( Zhang et al . 2016 ) . Kibbe and coworkers report that FoxO1 protects β - cells from oxidative stress by inhibiting the expression of thioredoxin - interacting protein ( TXNIP ) , a cytosolic factor whose deregulation is associated with β - cell apoptosis ( Kibbe et al . 2013 ) . FoxO1 also promotes the expression of DNA repair enzyme GADD45 α , protecting β - cells from nitric oxide - elicited DNA damage ( Kitamura et al . 2005 ) . Taken together , FoxO confers an evolutionally conserved cytoprotective effect on cell survival and function . FoxO6 mediates insulin action via a distinct mechanism FoxO6 is located on chromosome 1 ( 1p34 . 1 ) in humans , which is different from FoxO1 on chromosome 13 Downloaded from Bioscientifica . com at 06 / 06 / 2019 01 : 01 : 56AM via free access Review R70 FoxO in glucose and lipid metabolism DOI : 10 . 1530 / JOE - 17 - 0002 J ou r n a l o f E ndo c r i no l og y s lee and h h dong http : / / joe . endocrinology - journals . org © 2017 Society for Endocrinology Printed in Great Britain Published by Bioscientifica Ltd . 233 : 2 ( 13q14 . 1 ) , FoxO3 on chromosome 6 ( 6q21 ) and FoxO4 on chromosome X ( Xq13 . 1 ) . Although catagoried in the FoxO family , FoxO6 has the lowest degree of homology ( ~ 30 % ) in amino acid sequence with other FoxO isoforms , consistent with the idea that FoxO6 is functionally divergent from the FoxO subfamily ( Wang et al . 2009 ) . FoxO6 is evoluationally conserved across the species ranging from the frogs to humans ( Fig . 2 ) , foreboding the physioloigcal importance of FoxO6 in health and disease . Indeed , characterization of FoxO6 in insulin signaling reveals that FoxO6 mediates insulin action on target gene expression via a district mechanism that is fundamentally different from other FoxO isoforms . Unlike other FoxO members that undergo insulin - mediated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling , FoxO6 remains in the nucleus of cultured cells irrespective of the addition of insulin into culture medium ( Jacobs et al . 2003 , Kim et al . 2011 ) . Likewise , FoxO6 localizes in the nucleus of hepatocytes in mice , independently of fasting or refeeding state ( Kim et al . 2011 ) . In accordance with these observations , FoxO6 lacks the consensus NES motif , correlating with the inability to undergo insulin - dependent nucleocytoplasmic trafficking . Nonetheless , FoxO6 is highly sensitive to insulin inhibition in cells . These observations raise a fundamental question as to how FoxO6 mediates the inhibitory effect of insulin on target gene expression . To address this issue , Kim and coworkers ( Kim et al . 2011 ) show that FoxO6 interacts with the multifunctional protein 14 - 3 - 3 in the nucleus of hepatocytes , coinciding with the conservation of a consensus 14 - 3 - 3 - binding motif ( 23 RSCTWP 28 ) within the FoxO6 DNA - binding domain ( Fig . 1 ) . This effect depends on insulin - stimulated FoxO6 phosphorylation at two consensus Akt / PKB phosphorylation sites Thr26 and Ser184 , one of which resides within the 14 - 3 - 3 binding motif . Thus , one potential mechanism by which insulin inhibits FoxO6 transcriptional activity in the nucleus is by insulin - stimulated phosphorylation of FoxO6 proteins . This effect distorts the FoxO6 DNA - binding domain and prevents FoxO6 from binding to target promoters . As an alternative mechanism , FoxO6 , when phosphorylated by Akt / PKB in response to insulin , interacts with 14 - 3 - 3 , a scaffolding protein that Figure 2 FoxO6 is evolutionally conserved across the species . Amino acid sequences of FoxO6 proteins were aligned in different species . The conserved amino acids corresponding to the nuclear localization signal ( NLS ) and Akt / PKB phosphorylation sites Thr26 and Ser184 are marked in red box .

There is evidence that FoxO1 adopts a similar mechanism for mediating the inhibitory action of insulin in cells . When phosphorylated in response to insulin , FoxO1 forms a complex with 14 - 3 - 3 , which masks FoxO1 DNA - binding motif and precludes FoxO1 binding to target promoters . Furthermore , 14 - 3 - 3 serves as an anchor to sequester FoxO1 in the cytoplasm , preventing FoxO1 from re - entering into the nucleus ( Accili & Arden 2004 , Barthel et al . 2005 ) . An important implication of these findings is that insulin inhibition of FoxO transcriptional activity and FoxO nucleocytoplasmic trafficking are two separate events . In support of this notion , Tsai and coworkers ( Tsai et al . 2003 ) examined insulin - dependent phosphorylation and subcellular localization of a mutant FoxO1 with an altered NES motif . Despite its inability to undergo insulin - mediated nucleocytoplasmic trafficking , such FoxO1 mutant is subject to insulin inhibition to the same extent as its wild - type counterpart . It follows that insulin inhibition of FoxO transcriptional activity can ensue without necessarily altering FoxO subcellular redistribution , but this mechanism depends on insulin - stimulated FoxO phosphorylation . This raises an interesting question as to why insulin promotes FoxO1 , but not FoxO6 , translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm , a compartmental effect that is sufficient , but not necessary , for insulin inhibition of FoxO1 activity . One plausible interpretation is that FoxO6 serves as a basal mechanism for adjusting the rate of hepatic gluconeogenesis for rapid adaptation to changes in physiological states . This mechanism ensures that constitutively nuclear FoxO6 can immediately prime the liver for augmented gluconeogenesis in the post - absorptive phase , in which FoxO1 is already translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in response to postprandial insulin release . The alternative explanation is that cytosolic FoxO1 proteins possess secondary functions in cells . Consistent with this interpretation , Zhao and coworkers ( Zhao et al . 2010 ) show that FoxO1 mediates autophagy via its protein – protein interaction with Atg7 ( autophagy - related protein 7 ) in response to cellular stress . This action , which takes place in the cytoplasm , independently of FoxO1 activity in the nucleus , influences autophagy - mediated cell death in cancer cells ( Zhao et al . 2010 ) . This observation also refutes the longstanding notion that FoxO1 , after trafficking from the nucleus to the cytoplasm , is destined for proteasome - mediated degradation ( Matsuzaki et al . 2003 , Kato et al . 2008 , Jang et al . 2016 ) . Insulin - dependent and - independent regulation of hepatic gluconeogenesis Gluconeogenesis is a pivotal metabolic pathway for converting non - carbohydrate metabolites ( lactate , glycerol and amino acids ) to glucose in the body . A life - sustaining process , gluconeogenesis provides the sole fuel source for the brain , nervous system , testes and erythrocytes during a prolonged fast or exercise . Gluconeogenesis takes place mainly in liver and to a much lesser extent in kidney ( Wahren & Ekberg 2007 , Edgerton et al . 2009 ) . In healthy individuals , hepatic gluconeogenesis accounts for up to 80 % of total endogenous glucose production during a prolonged fast ( Ekberg et al . 1999 ) . Gluconeogenesis is tightly regulated by hormonal and nutritional cues . In response to postprandial insulin secretion , hepatic gluconeogenic activity is suppressed to limit glucose production . This effect serves two purposes : ( i ) to prevent prolonged postprandial glucose excursion and ( ii ) to replenish glycogen content in liver , as increased glucose influx into hepatocytes promotes the synthesis and storage of glycogen in liver after meals . Conversely , in response to reduced insulin action and elevated glucagon secretion during fasting , hepatic gluconeogenesis is stimulated , resulting in increased glucose output from liver . Such a reciprocal mechanism , orchestrated by the two opposing hormones ( insulin and glucagon ) , is crucial for rapid adaptation of liver to metabolic shift between fed and fasting states for maintaining blood sugar levels within the physiological range ( Wahren & Ekberg 2007 ) . Gluconeogenesis is governed by two key enzymes , phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase ( PEPCK ) and glucose - 6 - phosphatase ( G6Pase ) in liver . PEPCK functions to convert oxaloacetate to phosphoenolpyruvate and G6Pase acts to convert glucose - 6 - phosphate to glucose . These two hepatic enzymes catalyze the first and last steps in the gluconeogenesis pathway . Consistent with their duties in gluconeogenesis , hepatic production of PEPCK and G6Pase is inhibited by insulin in the fed state and stimulated state by glucagon under fasting conditions . However , there is anecdotal evidence that increased hepatic glucose production can occur without the induction of hepatic expression of PEPCK and G6Pase in the liver . Samuel and coworkers ( Samuel et al . 2009 ) report that hepatic expression of both PEPCK and G6Pase mRNA levels remained unchanged , despite a significant induction of endogenous glucose production in the liver of human subjects and rats with diabetes . These results seem at variance with the dogma that hepatic PEPCK and G6Pase enzymes catalyze the rate - limiting steps in the gluconeogenesis pathway .

Thus , it remains an open question as to whether PEPCK and G6Pase protein levels and their enzymatic activities are correlated with rates of hepatic glucose production in type 2 diabetes . Aside from its direct inhibitory effect on gluconeogenesis , insulin acts to suppress gluconeogenesis by indirect mechanisms . Consistent with this notion , Olefsky and coworkers show that in obese subjects , suppression of hepatic glucose production can occur in response to insulin infusion without an apparent increase in portal insulin concentrations ( Prager et al . 1987 ) . Recently , two independent groups report that hepatic insulin signaling is dispensable for the regulation of glucose production in the liver ( O - Sullivan et al . 2015 , Titchenell et al . 2015 ) . Insulin is known to exert a potent inhibitory effect on hormone - sensitive lipase , which in turn curbs adipose tissue lipolysis and reduces the availability of free fatty acid ( FFA ) and glycerol ( Holm et al . 2000 ) . In parallel , insulin inhibits muscle proteolysis and restrains the release of amino acids ( Liu et al . 2008 ) . FFA is used as an energy source for gluconeogenesis , and glycerol and amino acids are precursors of gluconeogenesis . A significant reduction in FFA influx to liver along with dwindling supplies of ambient gluconeogenic substrates imparts a potent indirect inhibitory effect of insulin on hepatic gluconeogenesis ( Ader & Bergman 1990 ) . In addition , insulin acts on pancreatic α - cells to suppress glucagon release , limiting hepatic glucose output ( Unger et al . 1978 , Ishihara et al . 2003 , Jiang & Zhang 2003 ) . Recently , Perry and coworkers report that hepatic acetyl - CoA , derived from white adipose tissue , serves as a significant regulator of hepatic glucose production . Under fasting or insulin - resistant condition , hepatic acetyl - CoA levels become higher , fueling hepatic gluconeogenesis . This effect is acutely inhibited by insulin . Insulin suppresses lipolysis in adipose tissues to limit hepatic acetyl - CoA levels , contributing to the inhibition of glucose production in the liver ( Perry et al . 2015 ) . Thus , insulin modulates hepatic gluconeogenesis via both direct and indirect mechanisms ( Ader & Bergman 1990 , Cherrington 2005 ) . FoxO6 in hepatic glucose metabolism Although FoxO1 is shown to play a key role in integrating insulin signaling to hepatic gluconeogenesis , FoxO1 depletion in liver does not result in abolition of hormonal regulation of gluconeogenesis in mice ( Matsumoto et al . 2007 ) . In keeping with this observation , Kamagate and coworkers ( Kamagate et al . 2008 ) show that mice with FoxO1 loss of function in liver are associated with about 50 % reduction in gluconeogenic activity in response to fasting . FoxO1 loss of function reduces , but does not abrogate the responsiveness of liver to insulin or glucagon ( via cAMP ) signaling , raising the plausibility that there are additional factors or compensatory mechanisms in mediating hormonal regulation of hepatic gluconeogenesis ( Matsumoto et al . 2007 , Kamagate et al . 2008 ) . In this context , Kim and coworkers ( Kim et al . 2011 ) have characterized FoxO6 as an important regulator of hepatic gluconeogenesis in response to insulin . FoxO6 is expressed in both human and rodent livers . Hepatic FoxO6 expression is maintained at low basal levels in fed states . However , in response to prolonged fasting , hepatic FoxO6 expression and transcriptional activity is markedly induced in livers of mice in response to fasting . This effect translates into a significant induction of hepatic gluconeogenesis in fasted mice . Consistent with its role in regulating hepatic gluconeogenesis , FoxO6 targets both PEPCK and G6Pase genes for trans - activation in hepatocytes , and this action is counteracted by insulin . However , unlike FoxO1 , FoxO6 is unable to undergo insulin - dependent subcellular redistribution . Instead , insulin inhibits FoxO6 activity in the nucleus by directly stimulating FoxO6 phosphorylation and disables its DNA - binding activity . Conversion of the conserved Akt / PKB phosphorylation site at Ser184 to Ala renders FoxO6 refractory to insulin inhibition , contributing to its constitutive transcriptional activity . As a result , transgenic mice expressing the constitutively active FoxO6 variant in the liver are associated with increased gluconeogenesis , contributing to the development of fasting hyperglycemia ( Kim et al . 2011 ) . In contrast , hepatic FoxO6 deficiency attenuates hepatic gluconeogenesis , resulting in fasting hypoglycemia in FoxO6 - knockout mice ( Calabuig - Navarro et al . 2015 ) . Consistent with its independent role in regulating hepatic gluconeogenesis , FoxO6 depletion does not elicit a compensatory induction of hepatic FoxO1 expression or activity ( Calabuig - Navarro et al . 2015 ) . Taken together , these data have revealed a distinct mechanism by which insulin signaling through FoxO6 adjusts the rate of hepatic glucose production in response to changes in physiological states . Although it is claimed that FoxO3 and FoxO4 also participate in the gluconeogenesis pathway , hepatic FoxO3 and FoxO4 depletion did not result in further significant reduction in fasting blood glucose levels in liver - specific Downloaded from Bioscientifica . com at 06 / 06 / 2019 01 : 01 : 56AM via free access R73 Review s lee and h h dong FoxO in glucose and lipid metabolism DOI : 10 . 1530 / JOE - 17 - 0002 J ou r n a l o f E ndo c r i no l og y http : / / joe . endocrinology - journals . org © 2017 Society for Endocrinology Printed in Great Britain Published by Bioscientifica Ltd . 233 : 2 FoxO1 - knockout mice ( Haeusler et al . 2010 ) . Thus , the independent contributions of FoxO3 or FoxO4 to insulin regulation of hepatic glucose production remain to be determined . FoxO6 in the pathogenesis of fasting hyperglycemia in diabetes Excessive endogenous glucose production exerts its deleterious effect on whole - body metabolism in diabetes in three fundamental ways : ( 1 ) It causes prolonged postprandial blood glucose excursion , ( 2 ) it contributes to the pathogenesis of fasting hyperglycemia and ( 3 ) it accounts in part for diminished glycogen storage in liver . Because of its importance in energy homeostasis in health and its sequelae in disease , the gluconeogenesis pathway has been a major therapeutic target site for pharmacological intervention of hyperglycemia in diabetes . Identification of FoxO6 as a significant transcription factor for conducting insulin - dependent regulation of hepatic glucose production raises the postulation that FoxO6 might be a potential target for improving glycemic control in diabetes . Consistent with this idea are the observations that hepatic FoxO6 activity becomes abnormally higher in insulin - resistant livers of dietary obese mice and diabetic db / db mice ( Kim et al . 2011 ) . Likewise , hepatic FoxO6 expression is also upregulated in insulin deficient livers of streptozotocin - induced diabetic mice ( Kim et al . 2011 ) . These data indicate that insulin deficiency or insulin resistance is invariably associated with FoxO6 dysregulation in the liver . It is anticipated that selective FoxO6 inhibition would curb hepatic glucose production and ameliorate fasting hyperglycemia in diabetes . In support of this notion , Kim and coworkers ( Kim et al . 2011 ) show that siRNA - mediated hepatic FoxO6 knockdown results in a significant reduction in hepatic gluconeogenesis in insulin - resistant liver of diabetic db / db mice . This effect contributes to reduced fasting blood glucose levels , enhanced glucose tolerance and improved insulin sensitivity in diabetic db / db mice ( Kim et al . 2011 ) . Furthermore , Calabuig - Navarro and coworkers ( Calabuig - Navarro et al . 2015 ) show that FoxO6 - deficient mice are protected from developing fasting hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance in response to high - fat feeding . FoxO6 in hepatic lipid metabolism Apart from its role in mediating insulin action on hepatic gluconeogenesis and glucose metabolism , FoxO6 plays a significant role in regulating hepatic lipid metabolism . Kim and coworkers ( Kim et al . 2014 ) show that FoxO6 transgenic mice with liver - specific FoxO6 production develop hyperlipidemia , characterized by elevated plasma triglyceride ( TG ) levels . To dissect the underlying mechanism , Kim and coworkers ( Kim et al . 2014 ) demonstrate that FoxO6 promoted lipogenesis and augmented TG - rich very low - density lipoprotein ( VLDL - TG ) secretion . This action correlates with the ability of FoxO6 to stimulate hepatic production of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein ( MTP ) , a lipid transfer protein ( MW , 88 kDa ) . Produced mainly in liver and to a lesser extent in the intestine , MTP , when heterodimerized with its small subunit protein disulphide isomerase ( PDI , 58 kDa ) in the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) , catalyzes the transfer of lipid to nascent apolipoprotein B ( apoB ) , a rate - limiting step in the nascent assembly and secretion of VLDL and chylomicrons ( Gordon et al . 1995 , Hui et al . 2002 , Hussain et al . 2003 , Swift et al . 2003 , 2005 , Manchekar et al . 2004 ) . The observation that FoxO6 promotes hepatic MTP expression , which is recapitulated in primary human and mouse hepatocytes , underscores the importance of FoxO6 in regulating hepatic VLDL - TG secretion in response to insulin or nutritional cues . It is noteworthy that FoxO1 operates a similar mechanism for conducting insulin - dependent regulation of VLDL - TG production in the liver ( Kamagate et al . 2008 ) . In response to fasting , both FoxO1 and FoxO6 activities are upregulated in the liver . It remains to be determined whether FoxO1 and FoxO6 act in synergy to promote VLDL - TG production in the liver under fasting conditions . FoxO6 in the etiology of diabetic hypertriglyceridemia It is well established that insulin resistance is intertwined with hypertriglyceridemia in subjects with obesity and type 2 diabetes . Nonetheless , genetic factors that mechanistically couple insulin resistance with the pathogenesis of hypertriglyceridemia are incompletely characterized ( Sparks & Dong 2009 , Choi & Ginsberg 2011 , Sparks et al . 2012 ) . Characterization of FoxO6 as an integrator of hepatic insulin signaling with VLDL - TG production in the liver provides important insights to the mechanism of hypertriglyceridemia . In healthy individuals , insulin signaling through FoxO6 plays a pivotal role in adjusting the rates of hepatic VLDL - TG production to maintain normal lipid homeostasis . In insulin - resistant subjects , this mechanism becomes deregulated , as evidenced by significantly elevated FoxO6 Downloaded from Bioscientifica . com at 06 / 06 / 2019 01 : 01 : 56AM via free access Review R74 FoxO in glucose and lipid metabolism DOI : 10 . 1530 / JOE - 17 - 0002 J ou r n a l o f E ndo c r i no l og y s lee and h h dong http : / / joe . endocrinology - journals . org © 2017 Society for Endocrinology Printed in Great Britain Published by Bioscientifica Ltd . 233 : 2 production and augmented FoxO6 activity in the liver ( Kim et al . 2011 ) . As a result , hepatic MTP expression is markedly upregulated in insulin - resistant liver . This effect along with increased FFA influx into the liver promotes excessive VLDL - TG production , contributing to the development of hypertriglyceridemia in obesity and type 2 diabetes ( Kim et al . 2014 ) . As FoxO6 is the most recently discovered FoxO isoform , there is a lack of clinical studies about the role of FoxO6 in humans . However , there is clinical evidence that FoxO1 contributes to glucose and lipid metabolism in humans . Genetic FOXO1 variants are associated with glucose intolerance , insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes in Finnish men and Pima Indians ( Mussig et al . 2009 , Muller et al . 2015 ) . In contrast , it is also reported that such a close association between FOXO1 polymorphism and type 2 diabetes is lacking in different ethical groups including Caucasian and African - Americans ( Karim et al . 2006 ) . Further clinical studies are needed to characterize the role of FoxO6 and FoxO1 in metabolic diseases . FoxO6 in skeletal muscle Although FoxO6 is abundantly expressed in myocytes , its role in cardiac and skeletal muscles remains largely unknown . Chung and coworkers ( Chung et al . 2013 ) report that both FoxO6 expression and transcriptional activity are upregulated in myocytes by peroxisome - proliferator - activated receptor γ co - activator 1 α ( PGC - 1 α ) , a transcriptional co - factor that plays important roles in mitochondria biogenesis and fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle ( Wu et al . 1999 ) . PGC - 1 α also plays a key role in muscle fiber subtype conversion from fast - twitch to slow - twitch fibers for adaptation to oxidative metabolism in mice ( Lin et al . 2002 ) . PGC - 1 α binds directly to the FoxO6 promoter and stimulates FoxO6 expression in cultured myocytes as well as in skeletal muscle of mice in response to oxidative low - intensity exercise ( Chung et al . 2013 ) . Interestingly , increased FoxO6 activity in turn suppresses PGC - 1 α expression in myocytes , setting a feedback loop in which FoxO6 and PGC - 1 α interplays functionally for regulating oxidative metabolism in skeletal muscle in response to exercise ( Chung et al . 2013 ) . FoxO6 in the brain All FoxO proteins are abundantly expressed in the brain . However , unlike other FoxO isoforms ( FoxO1 , FoxO3 and FoxO4 ) with a broad distribution in the whole brain ( Furuyama et al . 2000 , Hoekman et al . 2006 ) , FoxO6 is preferentially enriched in the hippocampus , a region that is critical for learning and memory consolidation ( Jacobs et al . 2003 ) . This has inspired the hypothesis that FoxO6 might be involved in learning and memory consolidation . Indeed , Salih and coworkers ( Salih et al . 2012 ) show that FoxO6 - knockout mice display normal learning but impaired memory consolidation . These findings suggest that FoxO6 activity in the hippocampus is required for memory consolidation and that reduced FoxO6 expression in the hippocampus may contribute to pathological age - dependent decline in memory . However , this notion seems at odds with the observation that FoxO6 expression is significantly upregulated in the brain of aged mice ( Zemva et al . 2012 ) . In contrast , FoxO6 expression is significantly downregulated in the brain of dietary obese mice . This effect has been implicated in the pathogenesis of obesity and insulin resistance associated with dementia . Nonetheless , the underlying mechanism remains unexplored . Thus , further investigation is warranted to better understand the role of FoxO1 in the brain and its impact on cognitive function in relation with aging and diabetes . FoxO6 in longevity The FoxO family of proteins is known to play an important role in aging . Increased FoxO activity , resulting from attenuated insulin or insulin - like growth factor signaling , constitutes a caloric restriction regimen , contributing to lifespan extension in diverse organisms . This is typified by Daf16 , the FoxO ortholog that acts downstream of insulin - like signaling to regulate anti - oxidative function and longevity in C . elegans in response to environment cues ( Lee et al . 2003 , Murphy et al . 2003 ) . Likewise , the FoxO ortholog dFoxO seems to integrate insulin - like growth factor to aging in Drosophila melanogaster . Giannoakou and coworkers ( Giannakou et al . 2004 ) show that dFoxO overexpression in the fat body increases lifespan by 20 – 50 % in female but not in male Drosophila melanogaster . This conclusion was challenged by Tatar ( 2005 ) , who comment that their studies are limited to the experimental condition , under which control female flies are somewhat associated with unusually higher death rates during the time course of studies . Indeed , there is evidence that dFoxO is not required for dietary restriction - induced lifespan extension in Drosophila melanogaster , although dFoxO modulates this process Downloaded from Bioscientifica . com at 06 / 06 / 2019 01 : 01 : 56AM via free access R75 Review s lee and h h dong FoxO in glucose and lipid metabolism DOI : 10 . 1530 / JOE - 17 - 0002 J ou r n a l o f E ndo c r i no l og y http : / / joe . endocrinology - journals . org © 2017 Society for Endocrinology Printed in Great Britain Published by Bioscientifica Ltd . 233 : 2 ( Hwangbo et al . 2004 , Giannakou et al . 2008 , Min et al . 2008 ) . In a recent study , Dobson and coworkers took an opposite approach to address whether dFoxO is liable for the overnutrition - elicited reduction of lifespan in Drosophila melanogaster ( Dobson et al . 2017 ) . They demonstrate that even transient feeding with a sugar - rich diet in early adulthood could produce a long - lasting detrimental effect on subsequent survival in female flies . This effect could be ascribed to the sugar - rich diet - mediated induction of insulin - like signaling , which in turn inhibits dFoxO activity and suppresses dFoxO target genes encoding epigenetic regulators in the fat body . Their data underscore the importance of dFoxO in linking overnutrition to lifespan attenuation in Drosophila melanogaster ( Dobson et al . 2017 ) . Among the four mammalian FoxO isoforms , only FoxO3 is consistently correlated with longevity . Clinical studies characterize the FOXO3A as a susceptibility gene for human longevity in different ethnic groups including the Japanese from Hawaii ( Willcox et al . 2008 ) , Italian ( Anselmi et al . 2009 ) , German ( Flachsbart et al . 2009 ) , Chinese ( Li et al . 2009 ) , American ( Pawlikowska et al . 2009 ) and Jewish ( Soerensen et al . 2010 ) . Preclinical studies indicate that FoxO3 is required for the lifespan extension induced by caloric restriction in mice ( Shimokawa et al . 2015 ) . In contrast , there is a lack of association between FOXO1 , FOXO4 or FOXO6 and life expectancy in humans ( Kleindorp et al . 2011 ) . Likewise , transgenic mice with FoxO1 overproduction in skeletal muscle have a similar lifespan as wild - type littermates ( Chiba et al . 2009 ) . To date , the mechanism underlying FoxO3 - mediated extension of lifespan in humans or animals remains elusive and warrants in - depth investigation . FoxO functional redundancy and divergence Despite their structural conservation in the forkhead box domain and functional redundancy to some extent , FoxO proteins possess non - overlapping functions , in line with their variable carboxyl domains and differential tissue distributions ( Wang et al . 2009 ) . For example , FoxO1 , FoxO3 and FoxO4 are expressed across the brain . In contrast , FoxO6 expression is confined to the hippocampus region . FoxO1 - null mice die at embryonic day 11 . 5 due to defective angiogenesis and vasculogenesis in the embryos ( Furuyama et al . 2004 ) . In contrast , homozygous FoxO4 - and FoxO6 - knockout mice are viable ( Hosaka et al . 2004 , Calabuig - Navarro et al . 2015 ) . Although FoxO3 - null mice are viable , female FoxO3 - null mice are associated with age - dependent infertility , due to abnormal ovarian follicular development ( Castrillon et al . 2003 ) . FoxO6 - knockout mice are protected from developing fat - elicited insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome . In contrast , FoxO1 , FoxO3 and FoxO4 , all of which are evolutionally diverged from FoxO6 , display functional redundancy in Figure 3 FoxO6 mediates the inhibitory effect of insulin or insulin - like growth factor on target genes in central and peripheral tissues . In the liver , FoxO6 contributes to insulin - dependent regulation of gluconeogenesis via PEPCK and G6Pase . Similarly , insulin signaling through FoxO6 regulates hepatic MTP and APOB expression and modulates VLDL - TG production in the liver . FoxO6 also targets PGC1 α for trans - activation , which in turns suppresses FoxO6 expression in myocytes . Such FoxO6 - PGC1 α feedback loop plays an important part in regulating myoblast differentiation and oxidative metabolism in skeletal muscle in response to exercise . In the brain , FoxO6 contributes to neuronal regulation of myosin 6 ( Myo6 ) , Parkinson disease protein 7 ( Park7 ) , glutamate receptor 1 ( Gria1 ) , cAMP - dependent protein kinase type I - alpha regulatory subunit ( Prkar1a ) and amyloid - like protein 2 ( Aplp2 ) , key functions in memory consolidation .

These results highlight the functional divergence among the four FoxO isoforms in the body . Conclusion FoxO6 has emerged as a key player in glucose and lipid metabolism ( Fig . 3 ) . FoxO6 is ubiquitously expressed in mammals , characteristic of the FoxO family . FoxO6 constitutes a distinct route by which the liver orchestrates insulin - dependent regulation of gluconeogenesis and VLDL - TG production . Hepatic FoxO6 activity is increased , and this effect primes the liver for promoting glucose production and VLDL - TG secretion in response to fasting . In response to postprandial insulin secretion , hepatic FoxO6 activity is inhibited to suppress glucose production and VLDL - TG assembly in the liver and prevent excessive postprandial glucose and TG excursion . Unlike other FoxO members that undergo insulin - dependent trafficking from the nucleus to the cytoplasm , FoxO6 mediates insulin action in a distinct mechanism without altering its subcellular redistribution . Hepatic insulin signaling through FoxO6 plays pivotal role in regulating glucose and lipid homeostasis . Unchecked FoxO6 activity , resulting from insulin resistance , promotes hepatic overproduction of glucose and VLDL - TG , accounting in part for the dual pathogenesis of fasting hyperglycemia and hypertriglyceridemia in diabetes . These results characterize FoxO6 as a potential therapeutic target for treating metabolic disease . Apart from its role in the liver , FoxO6 in hippocampus seems to play an important role in memory consolidation ( Fig . 3 ) . In addition , FoxO6 appears to regulate oxidative metabolism in skeletal muscle ( Fig . 3 ) . Further studies are needed to define the distinct roles of FoxO6 in central and peripheral tissues .
