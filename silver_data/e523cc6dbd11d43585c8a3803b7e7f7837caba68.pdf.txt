Vasoactive intestinal peptide ( VIP ) and the pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptides ( PACAPs ) share 68 % identity at the amino acid level and belong to the secretin peptide family . Following the initial discovery of VIP almost four decades ago a substantial amount of knowledge has been presented describing the mechanisms of action , distribution and pleiotropic functions of these related peptides . It is now known that the physiological actions of these widely distributed peptides are produced through activation of three common G - protein coupled receptors ( VPAC 1 , VPAC 2 and PAC 1 R ) which preferentially stimulate adenylate cyclase and increase intracellular cAMP , although stimulation of other intracellular messengers , including calcium and phospholipase D , has been reported . Using a range of in vitro and in vivo approaches , including cell - based functional assays , transgenic animals and rodent models of disease , VPAC / PAC receptor activation has been associated with numerous physiological processes ( e . g . control of circadian rhythms ) and clinical conditions ( e . g . pulmonary hypertension ) , which underlies on - going research efforts and makes these peptides and their cognate receptors attractive targets for the pharmaceutical industry . However , despite the considerable interest in VPAC / PAC receptors and the processes which they mediate , there is still a paucity of selective and available , non - peptide ligands , which has hindered further advances in this ﬁ eld both at the basic research and clinical level . This review summarises the current knowledge of VIP / PACAP and the VPAC / PAC receptors with regard to their distribution , pharmacology , signalling pathways , splice variants and ﬁ nally , the utility of animal models in exploring their physiological roles . © 2008 Elsevier Inc .

VIP and PACAP 1 . 1 . Isolation and characterisation of VIP The isolation and puri ﬁ cation of ‘ vasoactive intestinal peptide ’ ( VIP ) was reported almost 40 years ago by Said and Mutt ( 1970 ) , who were investigating the high incidence of systemic hypotension in patients with severe lung injuries . Whilst trying to identify the vasoactive substance responsible for reducing blood pressure , a 28 amino acid ( aa ) vasoactive peptide ( VIP ) was isolated from pig small intestine , an organ which originates from the same embryonic bud as the lungs . Initial experiments showed the peptide had a diverse range of effects that included : increased vasodilatation and reduced arterial blood pressure ( Said & Mutt , 1970 ) , smooth muscle relaxation in respiratory and intestinal tissues ( Piper et al . , 1970 ) , and stimulation of electrolyte secretion in the gut ( Barbezat & Grossman , 1971 ) . Details clarifying the mechanisms through which VIP mediated these diverse actions started to emerge a few years later and were reported to be primarily dependent upon the stimulation of adenylate cyclase ( AC ) and the resultant production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( cAMP ) . The ﬁ rst de ﬁ nitive link between VIP and AC stimulation was reported in 1973 , with the peptide shown to increase enzyme activity in liver tissue ( Desbuguois et al . , 1973 ) . During this period it was also reported that patients with tumours expressing high concentrations of VIP or with elevated plasma VIP also suffered with diarrhoea ( Bloom et al . , 1973 ; Said & Faloona , 1975 ) . The secretory effects of VIP on the gut were likened to that of cholera endotoxin ( thought to stimulate AC ) and were ultimately proven to occur through stimula - tion of AC and cAMP ( Schwartz et al . , 1974 ; Swift et al . , 1975 ) . Since these early studies , many subsequent investigations have veri ﬁ ed that the biological effects of VIP are generally associated with increased AC activity and cAMP concentrations . As a consequence of VIP being isolated from the gut and its effect on electrolyte secretion , it was initially classi ﬁ ed as a gut hormone . However , more extensive immunohistochemical and radioimmunoas - says have since shown this peptide to have a much more widespread distribution , with a predominantly neuronal localisation shown throughout the central ( CNS ) and peripheral ( PNS ) nervous systems in a variety of species ( Larsson et al . , 1976a , b ) . This led to the suggestion that VIP may also have a role as a neurotransmitter , in addition to being a gut hormone , with ﬁ ndings from many studies in the last 30 years supporting this assertion ( Bryant et al . , 1976 ; Duckles & Said , 1982 ; Fahrenkrug & Hannibal , 2004 ; Van Geldre & Lefebvre , 2004 ) . 1 . 2 . Cloning and processing of the VIP gene It was a further 15 years before the human ( h ) VIP gene was cloned in 1985 , after which it was subsequently mapped to chromosome 6 , region q25 [ Fig . 1 ; Entrez GeneID : 7432 ; http : / / www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov ] ( Tsukada et al . , 1985 ; Gozes et al . , 1987 ) . Some six years later the rat ( r ) and mouse VIP genes were both cloned and found to be localised to chromosomes 1p11 [ Entrez GeneID : 117064 ] and 10A1 [ Entrez GeneID : 22353 ] respectively ( Fig . 1 ; Lamperti et al . , 1991 ) . Translation of the mRNA sequence produced from human VIP gene transcription yields a 170 aa precursor named prepro - VIP . Post - translational processing of the precursor yields the 28 aa peptide VIP , in addition to the 27 aa peptide histidine methionine ( PHM ) in humans , or peptide histidine isoleucine ( PHI ) in rodents ( Fig . 1 ; Itoh et al . , 1983 ) . Two alternatively processed forms of the latter peptide have been identi ﬁ ed , namely peptide histidine valine ( PHV - 42 ) and PHI - GLY ( Yiangou et al . , 1986 ; Cauvin et al . , 1990b ) . The peptides VIP and PHM / PHI are located on two adjacent exons and share 48 % aa sequence identity ( Tatemoto & Mutt , 1981 ; Bodner et al . , 1985 ) . The rate of transcription of the VIP gene is regulated by many factors . One of the ﬁ rst reported VIP gene regulators was cAMP , which acts via a 17 base pair cAMP response element ( CRE ) in the VIP gene sequence ( Hayakawa et al . , 1984 ; Ohsawa et al . , 1985 ; Tsukada et al . , 1987 ) . Transcription of the VIP gene has also been shown to be enhanced by protein kinase C activation , an effect which may partly be mediated by CRE , although this been debated ( Ohsawa et al . , 1985 ; Hahm & Eiden , 1996 ) . In addition , the VIP gene was reported to contain a 180 base pair cytokine - responsive region , which is sensitive to factors such as ciliary neurotrophic factor and leukaemia inhibitory factor ( Symes et al . , 1994 ) . G - protein coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) can also alter VIP gene expression , with the cholinergic agonist carbachol increasing VIP mRNA expression in neuroblastoma cell lines via M 1 , M 3 or M 5 muscarinic receptors ( Kristensen et al . , 1997 ) . Furthermore , pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide ( PACAP ) increased the rate of VIP gene transcription in NB - OK - 1 cells , rapidly increasing intracellular VIP concentrations in a reportedly cAMP independent manner ( Georg & Fahrenkrug , 2000 ) . Indeed , Adler and Fink ( 1993 ) showed that the VIP mRNA levels in SHSY - 5Y cells were increased by calcium and cAMP independently , with only the calcium mediated pathway involving new protein synthesis . 1 . 3 . Isolation and characterisation of PACAP Whilst attempting to isolate ovine hypothalamic hypophysiotropic hormones capable of stimulating AC , Arimura and colleagues discovered a novel 38 aa peptide , which potently activated AC in ovine pituitary extracts and in equivalent rat tissue ( Miyata et al . , 1989 ) . As a consequence , this peptide was named PACAP - 38 ( Miyata et al . , 1989 ) . Less than a year later a second peptide , produced as a side product of PACAP - 38 puri ﬁ cation , was also shown to potently stimulate AC ( EC 50 for both : 0 . 3 nM ) , with a comparable maximal response ( Miyata et al . , 1990 ) . Following sequence analysis , this second peptide was demonstrated to be a C - terminally truncated form of PACAP - 38 that was 27 aa in length and was aptly named PACAP - 27 . The PACAP peptides were suggested to be related to VIP as a result of the high level of aa homology ( 68 % ; Table 1 ; Miyata et al . , 1990 ) . In the initial in vitro studies which directly compared the three peptides in cultured rat pituitary cells , both PACAP peptides were found to be 1000 times more potent than VIP in their ability to activate AC ( Miyata et al . , 1990 ) . 1 . 4 . The PACAP gene The human PACAP gene was ﬁ nally cloned in 1992 and mapped to the p11 region of chromosome 18 [ Fig . 1 ; Entrez GeneID : 116 ] ( Hosoya et al . , 1992 ) . Subsequently the rat PACAP gene has been mapped to 9q37 [ Entrez GeneID : 24166 ] , with the mouse gene also cloned and mapped to chromosome 17 [ Entrez GeneID : 11516 ] ( Fig . 1 ; Cai et al . , 1995 ; Okazaki et al . , 1995 ; Yamamoto et al . , 1998 ) . Transcription of the human PACAP gene and subsequent transla - tion of the mRNA product yields a 176 aa precursor called prepro - PACAP ( Hosoya et al . , 1992 ) . This precursor is cleaved and modi ﬁ ed ( Fig . 1 ) to produce PACAP - 27 and PACAP - 38 , as well as a third PACAP - related peptide ( PRP ; 29 aa ) which shares just over 20 % homology with the PACAP peptides ( Okazaki et al . , 1992 ) . The PACAP and VIP precursor peptides are relatively similar in terms of general structure and processing , which is shown in Fig . 1 ( Vaudry et al . , 2000 ) . As for VIP , multiple factors are known to stimulate PACAP gene expression , including PACAP - 38 , phorbol esters and cAMP analogues ( Suzuki et al . , 1994 ; Yamamoto et al . , 1998 ) . 1 . 5 . VIP and PACAP distribution in the CNS and periphery Since their discovery and isolation , many studies have investigated the distribution of VIP and PACAP in a variety of species . In general , these peptides are found throughout the body , including in the brain and in nerves innervating peripheral organs , as well as in non - 295 L . Dickson , K . Finlayson / Pharmacology & Therapeutics 121 ( 2009 ) 294 – 316 neuronal cells and tissues in the periphery . There is a generally distinct pattern of distribution for VIP and PACAP in the CNS , however the peptides appear to be more co - localised in the periphery ( Fahrenkrug & Hannibal , 2004 ) . The distribution of the peptides shall be discussed here in brief , however detailed reviews can be found elsewhere ( Arimura et al . , 1991 ; Masuo et al . , 1993 ; Vaudry et al . , 2000 ; Fahrenkrug & Hannibal , 2004 ) . In the CNS , VIP and PACAP are generally found in different layers or cells of particular structures , with few reports describing any co - localisation ( Fahrenkrug & Hannibal , 2004 ) . VIP is widely distributed throughout the brain , with considerable expression in the cerebral cortex , hippocampus , amygdala , suprachiasmatic nucleus ( SCN ) and hypothalamus ( Koves et al . , 1991 ; Mikkelsen & Fahrenkrug , 1994 ; Acsady et al . , 1996 ; Fahrenkrug & Hannibal , 2004 ) . The majority of reports examining PACAP expression in the CNS have focused on PACAP - 38 , as this is the predominant form found in the brain , with some studies suggesting that PACAP - 27 accounts for only 10 % of total brain PACAP content ( Arimura et al . , 1991 ) . In the CNS , the highest levels of PACAP - 38 expression have been shown to occur in the hypothalamus , particularly in the paraventricular and periventricular nuclei and the SCN ( Arimura et al . , 1991 ; Masuo et al . , 1993 ) . Other brain areas in which PACAP - 38 is clearly expressed include multiple brainstem nuclei , the arcuate nucleus , the amygdala , thalamic nuclei , the cerebral cortex , the medulla oblongata and the posterior pituitary ( Arimura et al . , 1991 ; Ghatei et al . , 1993 ; Masuo et al . , 1993 ; Fukuhara et al . , 1997 ) . Although PACAP expression in neurons has been well documented , the peptide is also expressed in primary cultures of rat cortical astrocytes ( Jaworski , 2000 ) . Finally , both VIP and PACAP have also been localised to nerve ﬁ bres that innervate cerebral blood vessels ( Miao & Lee , 1990 ; Uddman et al . , 1993 ) . It should be noted that whilst many studies have detailed the neuroanatomical distribution of VIP / PACAP in the CNS of several species , in depth studies for the mouse , for which VIP / PACAP transgenic models are available ( Section 3 ) , remain relatively scarce . Co - expression of the VIP and PACAP peptides has been well documented for many peripheral tissues , although it is not always clear from these studies whether the peptides are found within the innervating nerves or within non - neuronal cells of particular organs . However , both peptides are expressed throughout the digestive and genito - urinary tracts , as well as in multiple exocrine glands ( Ghatei et al . , 1993 ; Werkstrom et al . , 1998 ; Vaudry et al . , 2000 ) . As was found for brain tissue , PACAP - 38 is the predominant form of PACAP expressed in peripheral tissues and organs ( Arimura et al . , 1991 ) . A particularly high expression of PACAP - 38 was detected in germ cells of rat testis , with the total amount of PACAP - 38 greater than that found in the entire rat brain ( Arimura et al . , 1991 ) . In contrast to the distinct localisation of VIP and PACAP in the CNS , their distribution is very similar in cells and tissues of the immune system . Both VIP and PACAP have been detected in the thymus , spleen and lymph nodes ( Gaytan et al . , 1994 ; Leceta et al . , 1994 ; Abad et al . , 2002 ) . In addition , VIP and PACAP expression has been detected in lymphocytes and thymocytes ( Delgado et al . , 1996b ; Gomariz et al . , 2001 ; Abad et al . , 2002 ) . However , in agreement with the general distribution of thesepeptides in the body , PACAP - 38 wasagain reported to be the predominant form of PACAP expressed in the immune system ( Gaytan et al . , 1994 ) . 1 . 6 . Conservation of VIP and PACAP The sequences of VIP and the PACAP peptides are highly conserved across species . The VIP aa sequence is identical in humans ( Bunnett et al . , 1984 ) , cows ( Carlquist et al . , 1979 ) , rats ( Dimaline et al . , 1984 ) , goats ( Eng et al . , 1986 ) , rabbits ( Gossen et al . , 1990 ) , pigs ( Mutt & Said , 1974 ) and dogs ( Wang et al . , 1985 ) . Both guinea pig and chicken VIP deviate from the conserved sequence by four aa ( Du et al . , 1985 ; McFarlin et al . , 1995 ) . The PACAPs are similar to VIP , with their aa sequences identical in humans ( Kimura et al . , 1990 ) , sheep ( Miyata et al . , 1989 , 1990 ) , rats ( Ogi et al . , 1990 ) and mice ( Okazaki et al . , 1995 ) , with the chicken ( McRory et al . , 1997 ) and frog ( Chartrel et al . , 1991 ) sequences differing by only a single aa residue . Interestingly , PACAP has also been identi ﬁ ed in a group of ancient protochordates — the tunicates or sea squirts ( a group that is suggested to have given rise to the vertebrates ) , and has been shown to differ by only one aa when compared to the human form , suggesting a strong evolutionary pressure to maintain the PACAP sequence ( McRory & Sherwood , 1997 ) . The ﬁ nding that PACAP has been so well conserved over 700 million years of evolution , has led to the suggestion that it is the ‘ most likelyancestral molecule for the superfamily ’ towhich it belongs ( Sherwoodetal . , 2000 ) ; thissuperfamilyofpeptidesisdiscussedinthe following section . 1 . 7 . The VIP / PACAP peptide family Due to the degree of sequence similarity with peptides such as secretin and glucagon , VIP and the PACAP peptides have been classed as members of the secretin peptide family , named after the Fig . 1 . Geneand peptide precursordata forVIPand PACAP . Chromosomal locations and cloning information areprovided for the human , ratand mouse VIPand PACAP genes . The basic structures of the VIP and PACAP precursor peptides are also illustrated for comparison , with the resulting mature peptide products from each precursor highlighted and amino acid homologies indicated were appropriate . 296 L . Dickson , K . Finlayson / Pharmacology & Therapeutics 121 ( 2009 ) 294 – 316 ﬁ rst member discovered ( Bayliss & Starling , 1902 ) . As shown for VIP and PACAP ( Fig . 1 ) , the precursor peptides of this family character - istically have a signal peptide , 1 – 3 bioactive peptides and both N - and C - terminal peptides ( Sherwood et al . , 2000 ) . The superfamily contains mature , linear peptides of between ~ 25 – 50 aa in length ( Table 1 ) . In addition to considerable sequence homology , the majority of peptides in this family also share certain primary ( C - terminal amide ) and secondary structural similarities , with disordered random coil structures at the N - termini and extended α - helical regions at the C - termini ( Clore et al . , 1986 ; Gronenborn et al . , 1987 ; Theriault et al . , 1991 ; Wray et al . , 1998 ) . For example , the nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) derived structure of PACAP - 27 published by Inooka et al . ( 2001 ) , was shown to contain a disordered N - terminal sequence ( residues : 1 – 4 ) and an adjoining C - terminal α - helix ( residues : 5 – 27 ) . The structure of VIP , as determined by NMR , also contains an N - terminal disordered region ( residues : 1 – 6 ) and an α - helix ( residues : 7 – 24 ) , with the remaining residues in the C - terminal region appearing to form a helical shape ( Tan et al . , 2006 ) . There is evidence suggesting that both the N - and C - terminal regions are important for the biological activity of the peptides and for speci ﬁ c receptor recognition ( Onoue et al . , 2001 , 2004 ) . For PACAP - 27 , the C - terminal region has been shown to be important for receptor binding , whilst the N - terminal region may in ﬂ uence ligand ef ﬁ cacy as truncated PACAPs such as PACAP ( 6 – 27 ) , are competitive antagonists of PACAP receptors ( Gourlet et al . , 1991 ; Robberecht et al . , 1992 ) . It has also been proposed that a hydrophobic β - coil may form in the N - terminal region ( for which His 1 , Phe 6 and Thr 7 may be involved ) and that this structure may be important for receptor binding af ﬁ nity ( Inooka et al . , 2001 ) . The peptides in this family have wide ranging functions , with the majorityof these physiological actions mediated by GPCRs ( vide infra ) . 2 . VIP and PACAP receptors 2 . 1 . VIP and PACAP interactions with G - proteins Prior to cloning , VIP and PACAP receptors were postulated to stimulate AC by interacting with guanosine triphosphate ( GTP ) binding proteins ( G - proteins ) , with GTP , Gpp ( nNH ) p and guanosine diphosphate all shown to inhibit iodinated VIP binding to rat prostate and liver membranes ( Ramirez - Cardenas et al . , 1981 ; Carmena & Prieto , 1985 ) . In addition , Couvineau et al . ( 1986 ) isolated a soluble VIP receptor complex from rat liver membranes that was associated with a GTP regulatory protein . From studies using cholera toxin to induce [ 32 P ] ADP ribosylation in the membrane preparations , these authors suggested that the G - protein associated with the VIP receptors was G α s ( Couvineau et al . , 1986 ) . At the same time and facilitated by protein isolation and the development of speci ﬁ c antisera , detailed studies emerged regarding the control of AC activity by guanine nucleotides ( Mumby et al . , 1986 ) . Subsequently in 1992 , Kermode and colleagues used cross - liking studies and antisera for different G - protein subunits to showa direct physical interaction between VIP , VIP receptors and G α s subunits , with it now well established that VIP and PACAP interact with GPCRs to stimulate intracellular signalling cascades . 2 . 2 . GPCR families GPCRsareheptahelicalmembraneproteinsthathavebeendescribed as the ‘ most important set of targets for research aimed at the design of new medicines ' ( Horn et al . , 1998 ) , and account for 30 – 45 % of modern drug targets ( Drews , 2000 ; Hopkins & Groom , 2002 ) . The human genomehasbeenestimatedtocontain ~ 950GPCRs ( Takedaetal . , 2002 ) , which is approximately 5 % of the total estimated protein encoding gene repertoire ( International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium , 2004 ; http : / / ensembl . lcb . uu . se : 8080 / Homo _ sapiens / ) . 7 - TM receptors are generally assigned into one of 5 – 6 families ( depending on the classi ﬁ cation system ) based on protein sequence similarities , with members of each familygenerallysharingover 25 % sequenceidentity in the7 - TMregion ( Fredrikssonetal . , 2003b ; Jacobyetal . , 2006 ) . Thethree mainGPCRfamilies ( A , BandC ) encompassthemammalianGPCRs , with the other smaller families generally considered to contain pheromone and cAMP receptors found only in fungi and moulds ( Gether , 2000 ; Harmar , 2001 ; Fredriksson et al . , 2003b ) . Group A or the ‘ rhodopsin receptor family ' includes amine , chemokine and purinergic receptors amongst its members ( Foord et al . , 2005 ) and is the largest GPCR superfamily , with the International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology ( IUPHAR ) receptor database currently incorporating ~ 270 members ( http : / / www . iuphar - db . org ) . The smaller group B or ‘ secretin receptor family ’ predominantly consists of peptide hormone and neuropeptide receptors such as the secretin , calcitonin , VIP and PACAP receptors , with ~ 55 members of this group currently recognised by IUPHAR . The group C family is the ‘ metabotropic glutamate receptor ( mGluR ) family ’ which in addition to mGluR , contains GABA B , calcium - sensingreceptors and sometaste receptors amongstitsmembers . There are ~ 25members of the groupC family intheIUPHAR database , with all members having distinct , long N - terminal domains of approximately 500 – 600 aa ( Takahashi et al . , 1993 ) . Another group of mammalian GPCRs is the small ‘ frizzled ’ receptor family , of which 11 members are currently listed in the IUPHAR database . These receptors bind ‘ Wnt ’ secretedglycoproteinligandsandaremostcloselyrelatedtothegroupB family , as a result of certain sequence similarities shared between the groups ( Barnes et al . , 1998 ; Harmar , 2001 ) . As VIP / PACAP receptors are members of the group B GPCR family , the following section focuses on this sub - family , however for excellent general reviews of GPCRs please see Gether ( 2000 ) , Pierceetal . ( 2002 ) , Kristiansen ( 2004 ) and Fredholm et al . ( 2007 ) . 2 . 3 . The group B GPCR family The GPCR for the brain / gut peptide secretinwas cloned in 1991 and subsequent sequence analysis found little homology to any of the previously identi ﬁ ed GPCRs ( Ishihara et al . , 1991 ) . Hence , the secretin receptor became the ﬁ rst member of a new GPCR family , later designated as group B . Many members of this family are activated by Table 1 Amino acid sequences for peptides of the VIP / PACAP / secretin family 1 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 GHRF Y A D A I F T N S Y R K V L G Q L S A R K L L Q D I M S R Q Q G E S N Q E R G A R A R L GIP Y A E G T F I S D Y S I A M D K I H Q Q D F V N W L L A Q K G K K N D W K H N I T Q GLP - 1 H D E F E R H A E G T F T S D V S S Y L E G Q A A Q G F I A W L V K G R G Glucagon H S Q G T F T S D Y S K Y L D S R R A Q D F V Q W L M N T PACAP - 27 H S D G I F T D S Y S R Y R K Q M A V K K Y L A A V L PACAP - 38 H S D G I F T D S Y S R Y R K Q M A V K K Y L A A V L G K R Y K Q R V K N K PHM H A D G V F T S D F S K L L G Q L S A K K Y L E S L M PrP D V A H G I L N E A Y R K V L G Q L S A G K H L Q S L V A Secretin H S D G T F T S E L S R L R E G A R L Q R L L Q G L V VIP H S D A V F T D N Y T R L R K Q M A V K K Y L N S I L N 297 L . Dickson , K . Finlayson / Pharmacology & Therapeutics 121 ( 2009 ) 294 – 316 peptides and have the same general structural features described in the preceding section , with ~ 30 % homology within the 7 - TM region ( McKnight & Gordon , 1998 ; Staceyetal . , 2000 ) . ThemajorityofgroupB receptors have an N - terminal domain of N 120 residues whichcontains a hydrophobic N - terminal signal peptide and the putative ‘ hormone binding domain ’ which contains numerous conserved aa , including severalcysteineresidues ( Harmar , 2001 ; Laburthe & Couvineau , 2002 ) . The receptors ' N - termini alone are not suf ﬁ cient for ligand binding withthebindingdomainappearingdiscontinuous , withcontactpoints alsoontheEC loops ( Linset al . , 2001 ; Unson , 2002 ) . ThegroupB GPCRs have been further categorised into three sub - families : B1 , B2 and B3 ( Harmar , 2001 ) . The ‘ B1 ’ sub - family contains the classical peptide hormone receptors such as those for glucagon - like peptide ( GLP ) , VIP , PACAP and growth - hormone - releasing factor ( GRF ) , i . e . the secretin family of peptides described earlier . All receptors in this subfamily signal through G α s - AC to increase cAMP , although coupling to additional pathways , including calcium signalling , has been reported ( Aiyar et al . , 1999 ; McCulloch et al . , 2002 ; Dickson et al . , 2006a ) . The ‘ B2 ’ sub - family isthelargestof thegroupandencompassesseveralsets of receptors , including the orphan receptors described as LN - TM7 ( Zendman et al . , 1999 ) or LNB - TM7 ( Stacey et al . , 2000 ) . The members of this group have very long N - terminal domains , which can be up to 2000 – 3000 residues in length ( Fredriksson et al . , 2003a ) and a 7 - TM region which shows considerable homology to other group B receptors . Additional characteristics of receptors in the B2 family include a region composed of ~ 20 % SER / THR residues and a CYS - box , both of which are found on the EC terminal just prior to the ﬁ rst TM domain ( Stacey et al . , 2000 ) . The B2 family also includes the EGF - TM7 group , found almost exclusivelyon immune cells , with distinct long N - terminal domains that containvariable numbers of tandemly repeated endothelial growth factor ( EGF ) domains ( McKnight & Gordon , 1998 ; Kwakkenbos et al . , 2004 ) . Despite showing signi ﬁ cant homology to other group B GPCRs in the 7 - TM region , evidence for G - protein coupling and transduction mechanisms for B2 receptors is scarce , with onlyfourmembersreportedtocoupletospeci ﬁ cG - proteins ( Lelianova et al . , 1997 ; Foord et al . , 2002 ) . The third sub - family is the ‘ B3 ’ or ‘ Methuselah - like ’ GPCRs , aptly named after the P - element insertion gene mutation in drosophila which generates mutant 7 - TM receptors associated with extended life - span ( Lin et al . , 1998 ) . Methuselah receptors have some homology tothe other group B receptors in the 7 - TMregion , howevertheydonothaveaSER / THRrichregionorCYS - box ( Stacey et al . , 2000 ) . In the last few years a generally accepted model of ligand binding and receptor activation of group B GPCRs has emerged . This model proposes that the C - terminus of the activating peptide binds to the long EC N - terminal domain of the receptor , after which the N - terminus of the ligand docks to the body of the receptor ( transmem - brane regions and intervening loops ) , causing a conformational change that allows intracellular loops to trigger signal transduction cascades ( Laburthe & Couvineau , 2002 ; Hoare , 2005 ) . However , an interesting alternative model has been proposed by Dong and colleagues ( Dong et al . , 2006 ) , who suggested that the hormone ( secretin in this case ) may expose a hidden , built - in agonist epitope in the amino - terminus of the GPCR which interacts with speci ﬁ c regions in the body of the receptor ( TM6 for secretin ) to cause activation . However , it remains to be seen whether this mechanism will apply to other members of the group B GPCR family . 2 . 4 . VIP and PACAP receptor classi ﬁ cation Initial pharmacological studies characterising putative VIP recep - tors generally involved either cAMP or radioligand binding assays ( using iodinated VIP ) , with these approaches available long before modern advances in molecular biological techniques , such as receptor cloning . These studies identi ﬁ ed generic ‘ VIP receptors ’ in a variety of tissues and cell types , including guinea pig pancreatic acinar cells ( Christophe et al . , 1976 ; Robberecht et al . , 1976 ) , rat brain and liver membranes ( Taylor & Pert , 1979 ; Guerrero et al . , 1981b ) , neonatal astrocytes ( Magistretti et al . , 1983 ) , multiple areas of the adult rat CNS ( Staun - Olsen et al . , 1985 ) , human lymphocytes ( Guerrero et al . , 1981a ; O ' Dorisio et al . , 1981 ) , lymphoblasts ( Beed et al . , 1983 ) and gallbladder and colonic epithelial cells ( Broyart et al . , 1981 ; Dupont et al . , 1981 ) . ‘ VIP receptors ’ were also identi ﬁ ed in various human carcinoma cell lines , including those derived from gut ( Laburthe et al . , 1978 ) , cervical ( Prieto et al . , 1981 ) , lung ( Laburthe et al . , 1981 ) , breast ( Gespach et al . , 1988 ) and pancreatic tissues ( Estival et al . , 1983 ) . During the same period many autoradiographic studies were published , in which iodinated VIP was used to identify the anatomical distribution of non - speci ﬁ c VIP receptors in a variety of central and peripheral tissues , from a range of species ( Besson et al . , 1984 ; Farmery et al . , 1984 ; Leroux et al . , 1984 ; Carstairs & Barnes , 1986 ; Shaffer & Moody , 1986 ; Power et al . , 1988 ) . The speci ﬁ c distribution of each receptor subtype shall be discussed further in Section 2 . 9 . The VIP receptors characterised in these tissues using VIP and the VIP - like peptides available at that time , showed variations in pharmacology , due in part , to the presence of multiple receptors and because of the lack of suitable ligands . It was not until ligands were identi ﬁ ed which appeared to discriminate between receptors , that distinct subtypes of VIP receptors could be clearly de ﬁ ned and characterised . In 1982 , Raufman and colleagues identi ﬁ ed a bioactive peptide from the venom of the Gila monster ( Heloderma suspectum ) that was able to stimulate AC and cAMP in guinea - pig acinar cells , in a manner similar to VIP and secretin ; hence the action of the venomwas attributed to secretin / VIP receptor activation ( Raufman et al . , 1982 ) . In further studies on intestinal epithelial cells ( which are devoid of secretin receptors ) , new data indicated that the action of the venom was speci ﬁ c for VIP receptors and that it had a similar af ﬁ nity and potency at both rat and human receptors ( Amiranoff et al . , 1983 ) . These studies distinguished the pharmacology of this ligand from other VIP like peptides , such as PHI and secretin , which differed in their af ﬁ nity and potency for the VIP receptors of the two species ( Laburthe et al . , 1983 ) . The active peptide in the venom , helodermin , was subsequently isolated and puri ﬁ ed ( Vandermeers et al . , 1984 ) , leading to an extensive analysis of its properties and the demonstra - tion of many VIP - like physiological effects ( Blank et al . , 1986 ; Naruse et al . , 1986 ; Koshiyama et al . , 1987 ) . However , differences in the peptides ’ properties began to emerge in terms of potency / binding characteristics , with a study by Robberecht et al . ( 1984 ) clearly showing that helodermin , VIP and secretin differed in their ability to stimulate cAMP production in membranes from several rat and human organs . These researchers tentatively suggested that the distinct actions of helodermin ( from both secretin and VIP ) may be a consequence of activating speci ﬁ c helodermin receptors ( Robber - echt et al . , 1984 ) . Four years later , the same group used iodinated helodermin and human T - cell lymphoma SUP - T1 cells , to provide further evidence for a single population of helodermin - preferring VIP receptors ( Robberecht et al . , 1988 ) . In this study , the rank order of potency ( ROP ) of the various VIP - like peptides examined was distinct from all other VIP receptors previously described , with helodermin having a higher af ﬁ nity ( ~ 6 fold ) than VIP in radioligand binding studies . In parallel cAMP studies , the same ROP was produced , with helodermin being ~ 3 fold more potent than VIP ( Robberecht et al . , 1988 ) . Around the same time , Turner and colleagues ( 1986 ) reported that rat basophilic leukaemia ( RBL ) cells produce an N - terminally truncated VIP fragment , VIP ( 10 – 28 ) , that was functionally distinct from normal VIP ( Turner et al . , 1986 ) . This peptide was shown to inhibit VIP binding and VIP induced AC activity in HT - 29 cells , whilst having no effect alone on AC activity and it was therefore suggested to be a VIP receptor antagonist . More interestingly , this peptide had no af ﬁ nity for , or effect on , agonist stimulated responses from VIP receptors in SUP - T1 cells ( Robberecht et al . , 1989 ) , again suggesting a degree of diversity in the VIP receptor population . 298 L . Dickson , K . Finlayson / Pharmacology & Therapeutics 121 ( 2009 ) 294 – 316 The gradual accumulation of pharmacological evidence leading to the eventual acceptance of distinct VIP receptors contrasted with the rapid identi ﬁ cation of a selective PACAP receptor following the isolation of PACAP - 27 and PACAP - 38 . Immediately after the isolation of both peptides ( Miyata et al . , 1989 , 1990 ) , high af ﬁ nity selective PACAP receptors were identi ﬁ ed in the rat AR4 - 2 J pancreatic cancer acinar cell line ( Buscail et al . , 1990 ) . Initially , PACAP was tested in this cell line as it expressed VIP receptors , and because of the sequence similarities between the peptides , it was suggested that PACAP may interact with VIP receptors ( Svoboda et al . , 1988 ; Buscail et al . , 1990 ) . However , PACAP - 27 and PACAP - 38 were shown to have an equally high af ﬁ nity for PACAP binding sites in these cells , with both VIP and helodermin being of much lower ( ~ 1000 fold ) af ﬁ nity ( Buscail et al . , 1990 ) . Similarly , these studies also showed that the PACAPs potently stimulated AC ( EC 50 : 0 . 2 nM for both peptides ) in AR4 - 2 J cells , with VIP and helodermin again being much less potent . In contrast to PACAP - 27 and PACAP - 38 , VIP and helodermin actually appeared to be partial agonists in the AC assay ( Buscail et al . , 1990 ) . In the same year , similar high af ﬁ nity PACAP - preferring binding sites were also identi ﬁ ed in primary cultures of rat cortical astrocytes ( Tatsuno et al . , 1990 ) , bovine brain membranes ( Ohtaki et al . , 1990 ) , rat hypothalamus , brain stem , cerebellum and lung membranes ( Lam et al . , 1990 ) and in the NB - OK - 1 human neuroblastoma cell line ( Cauvin et al . , 1990a ) . Around this time , data from many studies using a combination of VIP , PACAP - 27 , PACAP - 38 and helodermin amongst others ( e . g . secretin and PHI ) began to identify differences in pharmacology , clearly distinguishing distinct receptor subtypes . For example , PACAP and helodermin were found to bind with equal af ﬁ nity to the VIP - helodermin preferring receptors in SUP - T1 cells ( Gourlet et al . , 1991 ) . Autoradiography studies using numerous rat tissues clearly identi ﬁ ed two PACAP binding sites , one of which was PACAP preferring , whereas VIP and PACAP had equal af ﬁ nity for the second site ( Shivers et al . , 1991 ) . PACAP and VIP also bound equally well to receptors in jejunal epithelial plasma membranes , with helodermin being less potent ( Salomon et al . , 1993 ) . The emerging pattern suggested there were two classes of VIP receptors , both of which PACAP bound to with high af ﬁ nity , however the two subtypes could be distinguished by examining the potency of other ligands , including helodermin . In addition , a third receptor class was more easily recognisable by its clear preference for PACAP compared to VIP . These three receptor subtypes were later classi ﬁ ed by IUPHAR into ‘ VPAC receptors ’ for VIP and PACAP , and ‘ PAC 1 receptors ’ which were the PACAP - preferring subtype ( Harmar et al . , 1998 ) . The VPAC receptors were divided further into VPAC 1 R and VPAC 2 R subtypes , based upon helodermin binding / potency ( VPAC 2 R being helodermin preferring ) . 2 . 5 . Cloning of VPAC / PAC receptors The VPAC 1 R was initially cloned from a rat lung cDNA library by Ishihara and colleagues in 1991 , the human homologue was then cloned from the HT - 29 colon carcinoma cell line ( Sreedharan et al . , 1993 ) and ﬁ nally , the mouse sequence was cloned from mouse lymphoid cells in 1996 ( Johnson et al . , 1996 ) . When examined in stably transfected cell lines , the general agonist ROP for this receptor subtype ( in cAMP studies ) is VIP = PACAP - 27 = PACAP - 38 = PHM N secretin , with EC 50 values for the ﬁ rst fouragonists being approximately 0 . 01 – 0 . 1 nM ( Ishihara et al . , 1992 ; Sreedharan et al . , 1993 ; Dickson et al . , 2006a , b ) . A small number of studies have examined endogenous VPAC 1 R function in HT - 29 cells and have also shown VIP and the PACAP peptides to be equipotent with low nanomolar potency in cAMP assays and with secretin again being considerably less potent ( Laburthe et al . , 1978 ; Mangeat et al . , 1981 ; Lelievre et al . , 1998 ; Summers et al . , 2003 ) . Additional human cell lines in which endogenous VPAC 1 R function has been studied include the LoVo ( colon adenocarcinoma : Yu et al . , 1992 ; Gourlet et al . , 1997a ) and HeLa ( cervical carcinoma : Laburthe et al . , 1980 ; Prieto et al . , 1981 ) cell lines . The VPAC 2 R was ﬁ rst cloned by Lutz and co - workers from a rat pituitary cDNA library ( Lutz et al . , 1993 ) . This was quickly followed by a report describing the cloning of the human receptor from SUP - T1 cells ( Svoboda et al . , 1994 ) and then the mouse transcript from MIN - 6 insulin secreting β - cells ( Inagaki et al . , 1994 ) . When expressed in COS - 7 and CHO cells , the general ROP for the VPAC 2 R in cAMP studies is VIP = PACAP - 27 = PACAP - 38 = helodermin N PHI / PHM , with very little response to secretin observed even at micromolar concentrations ( Lutz et al . , 1993 ; Inagaki et al . , 1994 ; Svoboda et al . , 1994 ; Dickson et al . , 2006a ) . The majority of cell based studies examining endogenously expressed hVPAC 2 R receptors have focused on SUP - T1 cells , however some have used Molt - 4b lymphoblastic leukaemia cells ( Summers et al . , 2003 ) and THP - 1 monocytic leukaemia cells ( Chedeville et al . , 1993 ) . From the SUP - T1 studies , the generally observed ROP is helodermin N VIP = PACAP = PHI N N secretin , although a degree of variability is evident between studies ( Robberecht et al . , 1988 , 1989 ; Xia et al . , 1996 ; Gourlet et al . , 1997c ; Igarashi et al . , 2002 ) . Average EC 50 values reported in these studies from the examination of cAMP production , were ~ 0 . 3 nM for helodermin and ~ 10 nM for VIP and the PACAPs . Finally , the rat PAC 1 R was simultaneously cloned by several groups within just a few weeks of each other ( Hashimoto et al . , 1993 ; Hosoya et al . , 1993 ; Morrow et al . , 1993 ; Pisegna & Wank , 1993 ; Spengler et al . , 1993 ; Svoboda et al . , 1993 ) , either from rat brain cDNA libraries or the rat AR4 - 2J cell line . The human transcript was cloned in the same year , whereas the mouse variant was cloned three years later ( Ogi et al . , 1993 ; Hashimoto et al . , 1996b ) . When expressed in various host cell lines for functional assessment of receptor activity , the clear ROP for the PAC 1 R is PACAP - 27 = PACAP - 38 N VIP ( Pisegna & Wank , 1993 ; Spengler et al . , 1993 ; Dickson et al . , 2006a ) . In terms of cell lines endogenously expressing PAC 1 , receptor pharmacology has been examined using AR4 - 2J cells and the human neuroblastoma cell line NB - OK - 1 , with many studies also performed using rat phaeochromo - cytoma PC12 cells ( Buscail et al . , 1990 ; Cauvin et al . , 1990a ; Deutsch & Sun , 1992 ) . In general , data from PAC 1 R expressing cell lines ( cAMP assays ) has shown the PACAPs and VIP to have EC 50 values of ~ 0 . 2 nM and ~ 40 nM respectively ( Buscail et al . , 1990 ; Cauvin et al . , 1990a ; Spengler et al . , 1993 ; Dickson et al . , 2006a ) . 2 . 6 . Pharmacology of VPAC / PACR 2 . 6 . 1 . Generic VPAC / PACR ligands Prior to cloning of the individual VPAC / PAC receptor subtypes , multiple non - selective ‘ VIP receptor ’ ligands were reported , in addition to the endogenous peptides . Several of these ligands were ‘ VIP receptor ’ antagonists and have proven to be useful in de ﬁ ning receptor function , although the majority of these ligands are modi ﬁ ed analogues of endogenous agonists . These analogues fall into three main categories : C - terminal fragments of VIP / PACAP , chimeric or hybrid peptides and ﬁ nally , D - enantiomer substituted peptides . Some of the better characterised receptor antagonists are ( N - Ac - Tyr 1 , D - Phe 2 ) - GRF ( 1 – 29 ) - NH 2 ( Waelbroeck et al . , 1985 ) , [ 4Cl - D - Phe 6 , Leu 17 ] VIP ( Pandol et al . , 1986 ) , VIP ( 10 – 28 ) ( Turner et al . , 1986 ) , stearyl - Nle 17 - Neurotensin ( 6 – 11 ) - VIP ( 7 – 28 ) ( Gozes et al . , 1995 ; Moody et al . , 2002 ) , PACAP ( 6 – 27 ) ( Robberecht et al . , 1991 ) and PACAP ( 6 – 38 ) ( Robberecht et al . , 1992 ) . Most of these early ligands had relatively low af ﬁ nity ( µM ) for VIP receptors and have now been superseded by new ligands of higher potency and selectivity following receptor cloning and novel methods of peptide synthesis . Some of these selective ligands have proven to be useful in de ﬁ ning the physiological functions of the VPAC / PAC receptors , with BAY 55 – 9837 for example , highlighting important roles for the VPAC 2 R in glucose homeostasis ( Tsutsumi et al . , 2002 ) . However , almost all of the ligands reported to date ( vide infra ) are peptides and are predominantly modi ﬁ ed 299 L . Dickson , K . Finlayson / Pharmacology & Therapeutics 121 ( 2009 ) 294 – 316 versions of VIP and the PACAPs ( sequences provided in Table 2 ) , with only a single recent report describing non - peptide ligands for this receptor family ( PAC 1 R ; Beebe et al . , 2008 ) . 2 . 6 . 2 . VPAC / PACR selective peptides A highly potent and selective agonist and antagonist have been described for the VPAC 1 R . In 1997 , Gourlet and colleagues described a modi ﬁ ed hybrid peptide of VIP and GRF which was reported to be a selective VPAC 1 R antagonist ( Gourlet et al . , 1997a ) . This peptide , PG97 - 269 , has been shown to inhibit agonist induced cAMP responses in r / hVPAC 1 R expressing CHO cells with IC 50 values of ~ 40 nM ( Gourlet et al . , 1997a ; Juarranz et al . , 1999 ; Dickson et al . , 2006a ) . When tested at concentrations up to 3 µM , PG97 – 269 had no effect alone , or on any agonist induced response in h / rVPAC 2 or PAC 1 receptor expressing cell lines ( Gourlet et al . , 1997a ; Dickson et al . , 2006a ) . Three years later in 2000 , the generation of a VPAC 1 R selective agonist [ Ala 11 , 22 , 28 ] VIP was reported , following structure – function studies examining VIP binding to VPAC receptors ( Nicole et al . , 2000 ) . In AC / cAMP stimulation studies , this modi ﬁ ed VIP analogue has been observed to have low nanomolar potency at hVPAC 1 R ( EC 50 : 0 . 06 – 0 . 4 nM ) and to have no considerable agonist effect at VPAC 2 R ( N 1 µM ; Nicole et al . , 2000 ; Dickson et al . , 2006a ) . Until recently the potency of [ Ala 11 , 22 , 28 ] VIP at the PAC 1 R was unknown , however studies have now shown this peptide to be a full agonist of micromolar potency in an hPAC 1 R expressing cell line ( cAMP , EC 50 : 1 . 5 µM ; Dickson et al . , 2006a ) . Igarashi et al . ( 2005 ) similarly developed polyalininated VIP analogues as VPAC 1 R agonists , with [ Ala 2 , 8 , 9 , 11 , 19 , 22 , 24 , 25 , 27 , 28 ] VIP being of low nanomolar potency in AC stimulation studies ( EC 50 : 0 . 7 – 2 nM ) and selective for hVPAC 1 R relative to hVPAC 2 R ( EC 50 N 10 µM ) . A hybrid peptide , [ K 15 , R 16 , L 27 ] - VIP ( 1 – 7 ) / GRF ( 8 – 27 ) has also been reported as a potent and selective VPAC 1 R agonist ( AC studies , EC 50 VPAC 1 R 0 . 5 – 1 . 9 nM , VPAC 2 R N 1 µM ; Gourlet et al . , 1997b ; Langer et al . , 2006 ) . The ﬁ rst of the putatively selective and potent VPAC 2 R agonists were developed by Roche in the mid 1990s , as potential bronchodilators ( Bolin et al . , 1995 ; Xia et al . , 1997 ) . Two cyclic peptide analogues of VIP , Ro25 – 1553 and Ro25 – 1392 were described , both of which stimulated cAMP production in CHO cells expressing the human VPAC 2 R , with EC 50 valuesof ~ 1nM ( Gourletetal . , 1997c ; Xiaetal . , 1997 ) . Thepeptideswere found to be 300 – 1000 fold selective for the VPAC 2 R , however both compounds also showed clear agonist activity at VPAC 1 R , albeit when applied at micromolar concentrations . A number of VPAC 2 R agonists have beendeveloped by Bayer in anattempt to determinewhether they might serve aspotential therapeutic agents for type II diabetes , with the most potent ligands being BAY 55 – 9837 and R3P65 ( Tsutsumi et al . , 2002 ; Yungetal . , 2003 ) . Bothpeptideswereproducedfromsitedirected mutagenesis studies of VIP , PACAP and Ro25 – 1553 and are potent VPAC 2 R agonists ( cAMP stimulation , EC 50 : ~ 0 . 3 nM ) . BAY 55 – 9837 was shown to be 100 fold selective for VPAC 2 R over VPAC 1 R ( EC 50 : 30 nM ; Tsutsumi et al . , 2002 ) . R3P65 , which differs from VIP by only 4 aa , was slightly more selective ( ~ 200 fold ) for VPAC 2 R than BAY 55 – 9837 , however at higher concentrations R3P65 stimulated both VPAC 1 ( EC 50 : 90 nM ) and PAC 1 receptors ( partial agonist at micromolar concentra - tions ; Yung et al . , 2003 ) . However , in a more recent study ( cAMP stimulation ; Dickson et al . , 2006a ) although R3P65 was indeed a potent hVPAC 2 Ragonist ( EC 50 : ~ 2nM ) , thispeptidewasshowntobeevenmore potent at hVPAC 1 R ( EC 50 : 0 . 3 nM ) and to be a full agonist at hPAC 1 receptors ( EC 50 : 64 nM ) . In attempting to develop VPAC 2 R selective antagonists , Moreno et al . ( 2000 ) investigatedthepotencyandbindingaf ﬁ nityofmodi ﬁ edVPAC 2 R agonists , suchasRo25 – 1553 . Followingacylationof theamino - terminus of the extended VIP ( 1 – 26 ) KKGGT peptide with myristic acid ( C14 fatty acid ) , the resulting peptide , named PG99 – 465 was reported to be the ﬁ rst selective VPAC 2 R antagonist ( Moreno et al . , 2000 ) . In AC studies , these authors showed that PG99 – 465 was a potent VPAC 2 R antagonist ( IC 50 : 2 nM ) , however partial agonism at VPAC 1 R was also observed ( EC 50 : 200 nM ) , making this peptide 100 fold selective ( Moreno et al . , T a b l e 2 A m i n o a c i d s e q u e n c e s o f pu t a t i v e l y s e l e c t i v e V P A C / P A C R li g a n d s , w i t h t h e s e q u e n c e s o f V I P a n d t h e P A C A P s p r o v i d e d f o r c o m p a r i s o n 1 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 V I P H S D A V F T D N Y T R L R K Q M A V K K Y L N S I L N P A C A P - 27 H S D G I F T D S Y S R Y R K Q M A V K K Y L A A V L P A C A P - 38 H S D G I F T D S Y S R Y R K Q M A V K K Y L A A V L G K R Y K Q R V K N K [ A l a 11 , 22 , 28 ] V I P H S D A V F T D N Y A R L R K Q M A V K K A L N S I L A R o 25 – 1553 A c H S D A V F T E N Y T K L R K Q L A A K K Y L N D L K K G G T R o 25 – 1392 A c H S D A V F T E N Y T K L R K Q L A A K K Y L N D L K K B A Y 55 – 9837 H S D A V F T D N Y T R L R K Q V A A K K Y L Q S I K N K R Y R 3 P 65 H S D A V F T D N Y T R L R K Q M A A K K Y L N S I K N K R M a x a d il a n C D A T C Q F R K A I D D C Q K Q A H H S N V L Q T S V Q T T A T F T S M D T S Q L P G N S V F K E C M K Q K K K E F K A G K P G 9 7 – 269 A c H D - P h e D A V F T N S Y R K V L K R L S A R K L L Q D I L P G 99 – 465 M y r H S D A V F T D N Y T K L R K Q M A V K K Y L N S I K K G G T M a x . d . 4 .

Dickson , K . Finlayson / Pharmacology & Therapeutics 121 ( 2009 ) 294 – 316 2000 ) . However , other studieshave shown theactivityof this peptide to be considerably more complex , with partial agonism shown at VPAC 2 R ( EC 50 : 5 nM ) and full agonismatVPAC 1 and PAC 1 receptors ( EC 50 values : 8 and 70 nM respectively ) in cAMP studies ( Dickson et al . , 2006a ) . In contrast to the studies described above for VPAC receptors , the peptides reported to be PAC 1 R selective ligands have no signi ﬁ cant sequence homology to VIP , PACAP or any other member of this peptide family . Maxadilan , the ﬁ rst truly selective PAC 1 R agonist , was extracted from the salivary gland of sand ﬂ ies ( Lutzomyia longipalpis ) and was foundtobeapotentvasodilator ( Lerneretal . , 1991 ; Moro & Lerner , 1997 ) . Upon cloning , maxadilan was shown to be 63 aa in length ( Table 2 ) and is processed by C - terminal amidation to give a mature 61 aa peptide ( Lerner et al . , 2007 ) . This peptide was originally found to have similar biological effects to calcitonin gene - related peptide ( CGRP ) and was thereforeinitiallyevaluatedforbindingsiteinteractionsonratandrabbit brain membranes with other peptides in that family , including VIP , PACAP , glucagon and secretin ( Moro & Lerner , 1997 ) . From these and additional studies , maxadilan has been demonstrated to speci ﬁ cally bind to and activate the PAC 1 R , being equipotent with the PACAPs in stimulating cAMP production ( EC 50 : 0 . 05 – 1 nM ; Moro & Lerner , 1997 ; Dickson et al . , 2006a ) . No interactions ( binding or functional studies ) have been observed for maxadilan at either of the VPAC receptor subtypes ( Moro & Lerner , 1997 ; Dickson et al . , 2006a ) . Structure – function studies using maxadilan have identi ﬁ ed two deletion variants that are PAC 1 R selective antagonists ( Table 2 ) . The ﬁ rst , M65 , was described by Tajima and colleagues following the deletion of the 25 – 41 aa region of the maxadilan sequence ( Uchida et al . , 1998 ) . M65 was shown to inhibit PACAP stimulated PAC 1 R responses in a concentration dependent manner , however no IC 50 values or graphical data was presented for the cAMP studies described ( Uchida et al . , 1998 ) . However , in two recent studies the potency ( IC 50 ) of M65 to antagonise PAC 1 R agonist induced responses has been reported to be 4 and 150 nM , with the ﬁ rst study examining pigment dispersion in Xenopus melanophores expressing PAC 1 R ( Reddy et al . , 2006 ) and the second , cAMP production in PAC 1 Rexpressing CHO cells ( Dickson et al . , 2006a ) . Tajima ’ s group also reported a second deletion variant of maxadilan , max . d . 4 . ( Table 2 ) , with residues 24 – 42 omitted from the parent peptide , which inhibited PACAP - 38 simulated cAMP production in PAC 1 R expressing stable cell lines with an IC 50 of ~ 0 . 3 nM ( Moro et al . , 1999 ) , however these peptides remain relatively uncharacterised . Very recently , Beebe and colleagues reported the development of the ﬁ rst small molecule , non - peptide antagonists for PAC 1 R ( Beebe et al . , 2008 ) . These hydrazide compounds were produced during structure – activity studies of two glucagon antago - nists and were reported to be of nanomolar binding af ﬁ nity at PAC 1 R , although very little data was presented . In addition , no information regarding the selectivity of the compounds for the receptor or their activities in functional studies was shown ( Beebe et al . , 2008 ) . Therefore , it remains to be determined whether these compounds will prove to be useful in further delineating PAC 1 R function . Therefore , despite intensive investigation in the last 20 years only a limited number of truly selective VPAC / PACR ligands have been reported in the literature , including PG97 – 269 , maxadilan and M65 ( Table 3 ) . However the majority of VPAC / PACR ligands interact with more than one receptor subtype ( at least at higher concentrations ) and additionally , some of these ligands remain only partially characterised for the three receptor subtypes . 2 . 7 . VPAC / PACR signalling pathways As members of the group B GPCR family , activation of VPAC / PAC receptors characteristically produces a G α s dependent increase in [ cAMP ] i as described previously ( Section 2 . 3 , Fig . 2 ) . However , VPAC / PAC receptors can also stimulate the production of additional second messengers , a trait which is also observed for other GPCRs including β 2 adrenoceptors and calcitonin receptors ( Zhu et al . , 1994 ; Aiyar et al . , 1999 ; Xiao et al . , 1999 ) . In addition to cAMP , VPAC / PAC receptor activation can reportedly stimulate the production of intracellular calcium ( [ Ca 2 + ] i ; Dickson et al . , 2006a , Fig . 2 ) , as well as modulating the activity of phospholipase D ( PLD ; McCulloch et al . , 2000 ) , tyrosine kinases ( Morisset et al . , 1995 ) , calcium channels ( Chatterjee et al . , 1996 ; Tompkinset al . , 2006 ) , RhoAGTPases ( Henle etal . , 2006 ) , MAPK ( Moroo etal . , 1998 ) , carbonmonoxide ( Watkinsetal . , 2004 ) andSrc ( Macdonald et al . , 2005 ) amongst others . Although several years have passed since the VPAC / PAC receptors were linked with these additional transduction mechanismsfewstudieshavesystematicallyexploredthecouplingofall three receptors to these pathways and the associated pharmacology . Two of the slightly better studied VPAC / PAC stimulated second messengers ( [ Ca 2 + ] i and PLD ) shall be discussed further below . 2 . 7 . 1 . VPAC / PACR stimulation of [ Ca 2 + ] i and PLD Prior to VPAC / PAC receptor cloning , several groups reported that VIP and PACAP were capable of stimulating calcium levels in avariety of cell types , including rat superior cervical ganglion ( Audigier et al . , 1986 ) , adrenal medullary ( Malhotra et al . , 1988 ) , pituitary ( Canny et al . , 1992 ) and PC12 cells ( Deutsch & Sun , 1992 ) , hippocampal neurons ( Tatsuno et al . , 1992 ) , and SK - N - SH human neuroblastoma cells ( Oettling et al . , 1990 ) . The speci ﬁ c interaction of VPAC / PAC receptors with G - proteins coupling to intracellular calcium ( [ Ca 2 + ] i ) pathways was reported soon after the cloning of each receptor subtype ( VPAC 1 R : Sreedharan et al . , 1994 ; VPAC 2 R : Xia et al . , 1996 ; PAC 1 R : Spengler et al . , 1993 ) . Despite these early observations , only a limited number of studies have since investigated VPAC receptor mediated increases in [ Ca 2 + ] i either in cells endogenously expressing hVPAC receptors ( HT - 29 , Sreedharan et al . , 1994 ; SUP - T1 , Xia et al . , 1996 ) or in transfected cell lines ( HEK - 293 , Sreedharanet al . , 1994 ; CHO , Xiaetal . , 1997 ; Langeret al . , 2002 , Dickson etal . , 2006a ) . Thetransductionmechanismswhichcontributetotherise in [ Ca 2 + ] i reportedly include both G α i and G α q coupled pathways , with the G α i contribution estimated to account for ~ 40 % of the total [ Ca 2 + ] i response in VPAC receptor stable cell lines ( human and rat receptors ; MacKenzie et al . , 1996 ; Langer & Robberecht , 2005 ) . In contrast , although hPAC 1 R mediated stimulation of [ Ca 2 + ] i has also been reported in native ( SHSY - 5Y : Eggenberger et al . , 1999 , Dickson et al . , 2006a ; NB - OK - 1 : Delporte et al . , 1993 ) and recombinant cell lines ( CHO : McCulloch et al . , 2000 , Dickson et al . , 2006a ) , this calcium transduction pathway appears to be exclusively mediated via G α q ( MacKenzie et al . , 1996 ; Van Rampelbergh et al . , 1997 ) . The complex and differential coupling of VPAC / PACR to pathways stimulating [ Ca 2 + ] i ( Fig . 2 ) is paralleled in the mechanisms involved in VPAC / PACR stimulation of PLD ( Morisset et al . , 1995 ; McCulloch et al . , 2000 ) . For VPAC 1 , VPAC 2 and a splice variant of PAC 1 ( hop1 , Section 2 . 8 . 2 ) , receptor mediated elevations in PLD activity have been shown to be dependent on the small G - protein ARF ( ADP - ribosylation factor ; McCulloch et al . , 2000 ) . In contrast , PLD stimulation produced from activation of the PAC 1 - null receptor was shown to be entirely independent of ARF , with a component of the response identi ﬁ ed as phospholipase C ( PLC ) dependent ( McCulloch et al . , 2000 ) . Very few studies have examined PLD stimulation produced by VPAC / PACR activation and whilst increased enzyme activity has been observed in cells transfected with rat VPAC / PACR ( McCulloch et al . , 2000 ) , PLD stimulation resulting from endogenous receptor activity has only been reported for PAC 1 R in the rat pancreatic tumour cell line AR4 - 2 J and for unspeci ﬁ ed VPAC / PACR subtypes in primary rat glial cultures ( Morisset et al . , 1995 ; Dejda et al . , 2006 ) . 2 . 7 . 2 . Agonist potencies for VPAC / PACR signalling pathways Ingeneral , althoughcAMP , calciumandPLDcanallbestimulatedby VIP / PACAP activation of VPAC / PAC receptors when expressed in CHO cells , production of the former second messenger occurs more readily than the latter two . In the few studies in which PLD responses have been examined , VPAC / PAC receptor agonists were on average ~ 70 fold less potent in stimulating PLD activity than cAMP production in CHO cells expressing the rVPAC 1 , rVPAC 2 and rPAC 1 receptors ( McCulloch 301 L . Dickson , K . Finlayson / Pharmacology & Therapeutics 121 ( 2009 ) 294 – 316 etal . , 2000 , 2001 ) . However , forVPAC receptors eveninthepresenceof a considerable agonist induced cAMP response , sometimes no alteration in calcium is observed ( McCulloch et al . , 2000 , 2001 ) . Moreover , when a VPAC receptor mediated calcium signal can be detected , the agonist concentration required to elicit this response ( EC 50 ) varies considerably , ranging from at least one to two orders of magnitude greater than that required for cAMP ( Sreedharan et al . , 1994 ; Xia et al . , 1996 ; Langer et al . , 2001 ; MacKenzie et al . , 2001 ; Dickson et al . , 2006a ) . This difference in agonist potency in stimulating cAMP and calcium responses can also be seen for PAC 1 receptors in both stable cell lines ( Deutsch & Sun , 1992 ; Spengler et al . , 1993 ; McCulloch et al . , 2001 ; Dickson et al . , 2006a ) and cells endogenously expressing the receptor ( Dickson et al . , 2006a ) . As assay methodologies , cell type and receptor expression levels have varied considerably in studies of VPAC / PAC receptor signalling and pharmacology , it is therefore dif ﬁ cult to conclude exactly what underlies the different agonist potencies for the various transduction pathways ( Ciccarelli et al . , 1994 ; Laburthe & Couvineau , 2002 ) . Whether in cell lines in which the receptors are endogenously expressed or in cells in which the receptors are stably transfected , changing levels of receptor expression may in ﬂ uence the character - istics of the responses observed ( Langer et al . , 2002 ; Langer & Robberecht , 2005 ) . In transfected cell lines , the identity of the host cell line may in ﬂ uence the repertoire of agonist induced responses observed following VPAC / PAC receptor activation . For example , hVPAC 1 R have been shown to mediate calcium responses via coupling toG α q andG α i ( pertussistoxinsensitive ) proteinsinstablytransfected CHO cells ( Langer & Robberecht , 2005 ) . However , in HEK - 293 cells expressing the hVPAC 1 R , no coupling to pertussis toxin sensitive G α i was observed , despite the demonstration of agonist induced calcium responsesinthatcellline ( Sreedharanetal . , 1994 ; Shreeveetal . , 2000 ) . These ﬁ ndings indicate that the speci ﬁ c G - protein / second messenger complement of the cell line being examined could alter the transduc - tion pathways / pharmacology observed for VPAC / PAC receptors ( Laburthe & Couvineau , 2002 ; Langer et al . , 2002 ) . It is well known that VIP and PACAP are rapidly metabolised and although not extensivelycharacterised , it is not inconceivable thattheirdegradation products may contribute to the plethora of VPAC / PACR mediated signalling ( Bourgault et al . , 2008 ; Onoue et al . , 2008 ) . Further variability in VPAC / PAC receptor pharmacology between different cell types could also involve the interesting interactions between these receptors and receptor activity - modifying proteins ( RAMPs ) . The RAMPs are single transmembrane proteins which are reported to alter the traf ﬁ cking , pharmacology , and signalling character - istics of GPCRs ( Hayet al . , 2006 ) . Sexton andcolleagues have shown that the VPAC 1 R strongly interacts with RAMPs , with the speci ﬁ c interaction with RAMP2 demonstrated to enhance VIP induced inositol phosphate hydrolysis with no corresponding effect on cAMP responses ( Christo - poulosetal . , 2003 ; Sextonetal . , 2006 ) . Incontrast , theseauthorsshowed nosigni ﬁ cantinteractionofVPAC 2 RwithRAMPs , withnoexaminationof the PAC 1 R reported ( Sexton et al . , 2006 ) . With the RAMPs shown to have awidespreaddistributionthroughoutthenervoussystemandperipheral tissues , their potential in ﬂ uence on VPAC / PACR pharmacology and signalling merits continued evaluation ( Hay et al . , 2006 ) .

Fig . 2 . Intracellular signalling pathways stimulated by VPAC / PACR activation . The ﬁ gure highlights the principal transduction pathways activated by VPAC 1 , VPAC 2 and PAC 1 - null receptorcoupling to heterotrimeric G - proteins . Upon activation , all three receptors are capable of coupling to G α s leading to downstream production of cAMP . In addition , the three receptors can also activate PLC leading to an increase in [ Ca 2 + ] i , via coupling to G α q ( all three receptors ) and G α i ( VPAC 1 and VPAC 2 only ) . PLD activity can also be stimulated by the three receptor subtypes via ARF ( VPACR ) and PKC ( PAC 1 R ) sensitive pathways . 302 L . Dickson , K . Finlayson / Pharmacology & Therapeutics 121 ( 2009 ) 294 – 316 Although the speci ﬁ c VIP / PACAP signalling pathways which lead to the production of [ Ca 2 + ] i and PLD have been partially delineated ( [ Ca 2 + ] i : VPAC 1 / 2 partly G α q mediated , PAC 1 - null G α i mediated ; PLD : VPAC 1 / 2 partly ARF mediated , PAC 1 - null partly PKC mediated ) , a proportion of the responses mediated by the different receptor subtypes arise from currently uncharacterised pathways . It is possible that a degree of [ Ca 2 + ] i and PLD stimulation arises from non - conventional VIP / PACAP modulated pathways / proteins , such as those involving acetylcholine ( Choietal . , 2007 ) , calmodulin , ( Stallwoodetal . , 1992 ; Mahon & Shimada , 2005 ) , FPRL1 ( Kim et al . , 2006 ) and carbon monoxide ( Watkins et al . , 2004 ) amongst others . 2 . 8 . VPAC / PACR variants Although many of the mammalian genes encoding GPCRs are intronless , the VPAC / PAC receptors and other group B receptors including the calcitonin and GRF receptors are exceptions ( Gentles & Karlin , 1999 ) . The presence of introns introduces the possibility of genes being processed differently ( e . g . alternative splicing , exon skipping ) , thereby generating receptor splice variants , which could lead to alterations in pharmacology and signal transduction mechan - isms ( Kilpatrick et al . , 1999 ) . Until recently VPAC receptors splice variants were not thought to occur , contrasting with the multiple PAC 1 R variants already identi ﬁ ed ( Table 4 ) . 2 . 8 . 1 . Variants of the VPAC receptors A recent report using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and SUP - T1 cells , described putative 5 - TM variants of both the VPAC 1 R ( 88 aa deletion ) and VPAC 2 R ( 74 aa deletion ; Bokaei et al . , 2006 ) . Both of these variants were postulated to lack sections of the third IC loop , the third EC loop and the TM domains 6 – 7 ( Bokaei et al . , 2006 ) . These authors examined the functional properties of the truncated VPAC 1 R variant in CHO cells and demonstrated poor coupling to cAMP pathways . As this was the ﬁ rst report of a functional VPAC 1 R variant , and the ﬁ rst report of 5 - TM VPAC / PAC variants , it is clear further studies are required to determine the distribution and physiological relevance of such receptor variants . In addition , two naturally occurring deletion variants of the VPAC 2 R have been identi ﬁ ed in recent years by Goetzl and colleagues . The ﬁ rst , VPAC 2 de367 – 380 , was identi ﬁ ed in mouse thymus and spleen , having a 42 base pair deletion in exon 12 that resulted in a 14 aa omission ( 367 – 380 ) at the C - terminal end of the seventh TM domain ( Grinninger et al . , 2004 ) . It has been postulated that this variant may be a 6 - TM receptor with an extracellular C - terminal , however how this variant arises is unknown and its distribution and physiological function remain unclear ( Huang et al . , 2006 ) . Following transfection of the mutant receptor into Jurkat T cells , VIP bound with the same af ﬁ nity as the standard VPAC 2 receptor , however modulation of intracellular signalling molecules , including cAMP and interleukin - 2 ( IL - 2 ) , was not observed ( Grinnin - ger et al . , 2004 ) . In addition , T - cells transfected with the mutant receptor secrete less IL - 4 upon VIP stimulation than cells transfected with the standard VPAC 2 R receptor ( Huang et al . , 2006 ) . The second VPAC 2 R variant identi ﬁ ed was found in a human malignant T - cell line and activated normal T - cells , and was produced as a consequence of the deletion of exon 11 , which resulted in the loss of 114 aa ( from 325 – 438 ) and 10 new aa in positions 325 – 334 ( Miller et al . , 2006 ) . This created a frame shift and introduced a premature stop codon , with the resulting VPAC 2 variant ( VPAC 2 de325 – 438 ( i325 – 334 ) ) , suggested to be a 5 - TM receptor . In preliminary studies these authors found that VIP had a lower af ﬁ nity for the mutant variant compared to the wild type VPAC 2 R and that the mutant receptor was less sensitive to agonist - induced down regulation with weaker coupling to intracel - lular signalling pathways ( Miller et al . , 2006 ) . In 2001 , Murthy and co - workers reported the presence of a VIP receptor in guinea - pig smooth muscle cells which was essentially VIP speci ﬁ c , with PACAP having very low af ﬁ nity ( Teng et al . , 2001 ) . The same authors have recently reported the cloning of this ‘ VIPs ’ receptor and have con ﬁ rmed that PACAP has a much lower af ﬁ nity and ef ﬁ cacy ( cAMP studies ) than VIP for this receptor when expressed in COS - 1 cells ( Zhou et al . , 2006 ) . The sequence of ‘ VIPs ’ was shown to differ from the VPAC 2 R by only two residues , with both located in the N - terminal ligand binding domain ( Zhou et al . , 2006 ) . The existence of a putative VIP selective receptor has been previously suggested by other groups , with Gressens and colleagues suggesting that a VIP selective receptor was responsible for mediating the neuroprotective effects of VIP following ibotenate induced brain lesions in newborn mice ( Gressens et al . , 1999 ; Rangon et al . , 2006 ) . In this model , VIP was a potent neuroprotectant , as were other VPAC 2 R agonists and PHI , however VPAC 1 R agonists and the PACAP peptides were without effect ( Rangon et al . , 2006 ) . The presence of a ‘ VIPs ’ receptor was also postulated sometime ago by Ekblad and colleagues when investigat - ing the properties of VPAC / PAC receptors in the mouse intestine ( Ekblad & Sundler , 1997 ; Ekblad et al . , 2000 ) . Therefore the cloning of the ‘ VIPs ’ receptor may facilitate more extensive studies into the distribution and function of this novel receptor variant and help con ﬁ rm whether it is the same VIP selective receptor proposed in these earlier studies . 2 . 8 . 2 . PAC 1 R variants The PAC 1 R has been described as ‘ one of the most extensively spliced GPCRs known ’ , with variants carrying changes in the IC loops , TM domains , and N - terminal regions ( Dautzenberg et al . , 1999 ) . Although the presence of potential splice sites in such a range of regions is not common , a similar pattern has been reported for calcitonin and GRF receptors ( Kilpatrick et al . , 1999 ) . In contrast to the VPAC receptors , the ﬁ rst PAC 1 R variants were identi ﬁ ed at the time of the initial receptor cloning by Spengler et al . ( 1993 ) . These authors reported the cloning of ﬁ ve distinct PAC 1 receptor variants from a newborn rat colliculi cDNA library , which were named null , hip , hop1 , hop2 and hiphop1 , according to the presence of two 28 aa cassettes ( hip and hop ) in the third IC loop ( Fig . 3 ) . The PAC 1 - hop1 ( 28 residue insertion ) and hop2 ( 27 residue insertion ) variants were suggested to originate from the alternative use of splice acceptor sites in the hop cassette . The null and hop1 variants were shown to be the predominant PAC 1 R variants found in several rat brain regions ( Spengler et al . , 1993 ) . Using the same techniques , these authors subsequently reported the cloning of the sixth and ﬁ nal combination of these cassettes , the PAC 1 - hiphop2 receptor ( Journot et al . , 1995 ) . When expressed in a porcine kidney epithelial cell line ( LLC PK1 ) , the presence of the hip cassette was generally shown to reduce agonist induced AC stimulation and abolish calcium responses following agonist stimulation , whereas the hop cassette appeared to have no in ﬂ uence on the ability of the agonist to increase cAMP or calcium concentrations ( Spengler et al . , 1993 ; Journot et al . , 1995 ) . The receptors which contained both cassettes were shown to have an intermediate phenotype , with agonists having a marginally reduced potency and producing a smaller peak calcium response for the PAC 1 - hiphop1 receptor ( compared to PAC 1 - null ; Journot et al . , 1995 ) . More recently , Mustafa et al . ( 2007 ) expressed bovine PAC 1 - hop1 and PAC 1 - null in NG108 - 15 ( neuroblastoma - glioma fusion ) and PC - 12G ( pheo - chromocytoma ) cells and reported that whereas PACAP treatment of cells expressing either variant increased [ cAMP ] i , elevation of [ Ca 2 + ] i was only detected in cells expressing the hop variant . The lack of PAC 1 - null [ Ca 2 + ] i stimulation is in contrast with previous reports ( Spengler et al . , 1993 ; Dickson et al . , 2006a ) , with the authors suggesting such differences may be a result of using neuroendocrine rather than non - neuroendocrine cells to examine receptor signalling ( Mustafa et al . , 2007 ) . These studies highlight the need to examine receptor signalling in a variety of cell types , particularly human , in order to gain a full understanding of their signalling properties . Following on from Spengler and co - workers initial reports describing PAC 1 R variants , the same group also identi ﬁ ed an N - 303 L . Dickson , K . Finlayson / Pharmacology & Therapeutics 121 ( 2009 ) 294 – 316 terminal PAC 1 R variant from a mouse genomic library , with the corresponding human sequence isolated from a fetal brain cDNA library ( Pantaloni et al . , 1996 ) . They suggested this variant was producedfromalternativeexonsplicing , resultingina21aadeletionin the N - terminal region ( Fig . 3 ; residues 89 – 109 ) . At that time , the variant was referred to as the ‘ very short ’ ( vs ) PAC 1 R and the only apparent functional consequence was a marginal increase in the potency with which PACAP - 27 activated phospholipase C ( VIP was not tested ) . In a subsequent study , VIP and PACAP induced cAMP stimulationwas compared in HEK - 293 cells expressing the ‘ vs ’ variant , and in contrast to the PACAP preferring null receptors , both peptides were equipotent ( Dautzenberg et al . , 1999 ) . In later studies , a PAC 1 R mutant equivalent to the ‘ vs ’ 21 aa deletion variant combined with the hop1 cassette was shown to be the predominantly expressed PAC 1 R variant in rat superior cervical ganglion ( SCG ) neurons ( Braas & May , 1999 ) . In accompanying pharmacological studies ( cAMP and inositol phosphate assays ) using cultured SCG neurons , the PACAPs had similar potenciesinbothassaysandwereover1000foldmorepotentthanVIP . In both of these assays , the maximum PACAP - 27 induced responses were slightly larger than those of PACAP - 38 ( Braas & May , 1999 ) .

Dickson , K . Finlayson / Pharmacology & Therapeutics 121 ( 2009 ) 294 – 316 frontal cortex cDNA library ( Pisegna & Wank , 1996 ) . As for the rat receptors , the human variants were distinguished by the presence of two exons , SV - 1 and SV - 2 ( corresponding to two 28 aa insertions ) , which were suggested to be equivalent to the hip and hop cassettes respectively . In addition to human PAC 1 - null , SV - 1 , SV - 2 ( of which there are two potential variants arising from alternative splice acceptor sites ) and SV - 3 ( combined presence of SV - 1 and SV - 2 ) variants were identi ﬁ ed and when stably expressed in mouse embryonic ﬁ broblast cells ( NIH / 3 T3 ) , all four variants were shown to couple to pathways that increased cAMP and calcium following agonist addition ( Pisegna & Wank , 1996 ) . In these studies , the PACAP peptides were equipotent at all four variants , being approximately 50 fold less potent in the calcium assay , which is consistent with other studies comparing VPAC / PAC stimulation of these signalling pathways ( Deutsch & Sun , 1992 ; Spengler et al . , 1993 ; Dickson et al . , 2006a ) . Maximal cAMP responses were similar for all four variants , however maximum calcium responses varied ( Pisegna & Wank , 1996 ) . The PACAP - 38 calcium response from the SV - 2 variant was approximately 8 fold higher than the null or SV - 1 responses , with the SV - 3 variant showing an intermediate level of calcium stimulation ( normalised for varying levels of receptor expression ) . The null variant was found to be the predominant form expressed in a human brain ( frontal cortex ) cDNA library , with the rank order of expression being : null N SV - 2 N SV - 1 N SV - 3 ( Pisegna & Wank , 1996 ) . In agreement with the larger calcium responses observed for the SV - 2 receptor , further studies demonstrated that this variant also produced a greater stimulation of immediate earlygene expression ( c - fos and c - myc ) when compared to the other splice variants ( Pisegna et al . , 1996 ) . The ﬁ nal PAC 1 R variant reported that year was cloned from rat cerebellar cDNA and was shown to differ from the null receptor at several residues , primarily in the fourth TM domain and was consequently called PACAP - TM4 ( Chatterjee et al . , 1996 ) . The substitution and deletion of two aa in the fourth TM region ( CVTV to SA - ; residues 279 – 283 ) , was in addition to the D136 N ( N - terminal ) and N190D substitutions ( second TM domain ) . When expressed in a hamster kidney ﬁ broblast cell line BHK - 21 , this receptor did not elicit any increase in cAMP or inositol phosphate concentrations following PACAP stimulation , although interestingly a clear calcium in ﬂ ux through L - type calcium channels was observed ( Chatterjee et al . , 1996 ) . Mustafa and colleagues recently disputed the existence of this variant from both a structural and genetic point of view and in addition , ( as discussed above ) reported the hop cassette to be a crucial determinant of PAC1R calcium signalling ( Mustafa et al . , 2007 ) . To date , PACAP - TM4 has not been examined in any other studies , however it would be of interest to study its signalling patterns in neuroendocrine cells to compare with the studies by Mustafa et al . ( 2007 ) . Three years after identi ﬁ cation of the TM4 variant , Dautzenberg et al . ( 1999 ) identi ﬁ ed a PAC 1 R variant in which 57 aa were deleted from the N - terminus . The deleted sequence was comprised of the 21 aa from the ‘ vs ’ variant described by Pantaloni et al . ( 1996 ) , in addition to the preceding 36 residues ( i . e . a deletion of residues 53 – 109 ; Fig . 3 ) . This variant was subsequently isolated from human cerebellar tissue and Y - 79 retinoblastoma cells and was described as the ‘ vs ’ variant , with these authors referring to the receptor described by Pantaloni et al . ( 1996 ) as the short or ‘ s ’ variant ( Dautzenberg et al . , 1999 ) . From reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) analysis , mRNA for the null , short and very short variants was identi ﬁ ed in human cerebellar and cortical tissues , and in Y - 79 retinoblastoma cells ( Dautzenberg et al . , 1999 ) . The PACAP peptides were shown to be less potent at the ‘ vs ’ receptor ( ~ 40 fold ; cAMP assay ) compared tothe null or short variants , although the ‘ vs ’ variant remained a PACAP selective receptor with only a small VIP induced response detected at micromolar concentrations . In addition , the maximum VIP induced cAMP responses from both the null and ‘ vs ’ receptor expressing cells , were reported to be two thirds smaller than those from the short variant ( in which the VIP and PACAP - 38 responses were equivalent ; Dautzenberg et al . , 1999 ) . In 2001 , Daniel and colleagues described a splice variant identi ﬁ ed in rat testis , which had an additional 24 aa in the N - terminal ligand binding domain , arising from inclusion of a cassette between exons 3 and 4 , and was consequently called PAC 1 R ( 3a ) ( Daniel et al . , 2001 ) . The exact location of the insert in the PAC 1 R sequence has not been described , but it lies in the N - terminal region , near the deletion site for the ‘ vs ’ and ‘ s ’ variants . In functional studies ( cAMP and inositol phosphate assays ) using transfected HEK - 293 cells , both PACAPs were slightly less potent at the ( 3a ) variant compared to the null receptor . More recently the ( 3a ) variant has also been identi ﬁ ed in newborn rat cortical astrocytes ( Pilzer & Gozes , 2006 ) . Fig . 3 . Variants of the PAC 1 R .

Finlayson / Pharmacology & Therapeutics 121 ( 2009 ) 294 – 316 The range of PAC 1 R variants was recently further extended by Lutz and co - workers , who identi ﬁ ed fourteen different human PAC 1 R splice variants in the SHSY - 5Y neuroblastoma cell line ( Lutz et al . , 2006 ) . The most abundant variants detected were the ‘ short ’ ( Pantaloni et al . , 1996 ; referredto as δ 5 , 6 + null ) , the short - hop1 ( Braas & May , 1999 ; δ 5 , 6 + hop ) andthe ‘ veryshort ’ variants ( Dautzenbergetal . , 1999 ; δ 4 , 5 , 6 + null ) . These authors also compared the ability of the variants to couple to cAMP and calcium signalling pathways when expressed in COS7 cells . In cAMP and inositol phosphate studies , PACAP - 38 was ~ 30 fold more potent than VIP in activating the δ 5 , 6 + null variant , which contrasts to the previous data ( cAMP ) showing these peptides were equipotent ( Dautzenberg et al . , 1999 ) . Although the agonist ROP for this variant was similar in both assays , there was a shift to lower agonist potencies ( ~ 140 fold ) in the inositol phosphate studies . For the δ 5 , 6 + hop variant , VIP was less potent than PACAP - 38 in both assays as reportedbyBraas & May ( 1999 ) , althoughthereductioninpotencywas only about 50 fold , in contrast to the 1000 fold difference described previously . Inaddition , therewas asmallshifttoloweragonist potency in the inositol phosphate assay ( ~ 25 fold on average ) which was not reported in the original studies . Finally , the δ 4 , 5 , 6 + null variant was con ﬁ rmed to be a PACAP preferring receptor in cAMP studies and as reported previously , agonists were less potent at this variant when compared to the PAC 1 - null receptor ( Dautzenberg et al . , 1999 ) . As the majority of the studies described above were performed in cell lines , it remains dif ﬁ cult to de ﬁ nitively predict what the in vivo signi ﬁ cance of these receptor variants might be . Although altered receptor pharmacology and signalling are likely to affect cellular functions , more in depth information , e . g . tissue / cellular distribution and expression levels , is still needed to delineate what physiological effects might be altered by the presence of these receptor variants . 2 . 9 . Distribution of VPAC / PACR The distribution of VPAC / PAC receptors has been thoroughly investigated in several species , using a range of techniques such as autoradiographyand in situ hybridisation ( ISH ) studies . Below is a short summary of VPAC / PAC receptor distribution , however more detailed reviews are available elsewhere ( Usdin et al . , 1994 ; Sheward et al . , 1995 ; Vertongen et al . , 1998 ; Vaudry et al . , 2000 ; Harmar et al . , 2004 ) . FollowingthecloningoftheVPAC 1 R , initialISHandnorthernblotting studies demonstrated expression in brain , heart , lung , kidney , small intestine , hippocampus and cerebral cortex ( Ishihara et al . , 1992 ; Sreedharan et al . , 1993 ) . More detailed studies of VPAC 1 R expression in the CNS found the receptor localised to the pyrifom cortex , cerebral cortex , dentate gyrus , lateral amygdaloid nucleus , caudate putamen , supraoptic nucleus , choroid plexus , dentate gyrus and the pineal gland ( Usdin et al . , 1994 ; Vertongen et al . , 1998 ; Vaudry et al . , 2000 ) . In peripheral tissues , the VPAC 1 R has been shown to be expressed in numerous tissues and organs , including liver , kidney , prostate , breast , spleen , lung , mucosa of the gastro - intestinal tract and also on lymphocytes in lymph nodes and in almost all human epithelial tissues ( Reubi , 2000 ) . At the time of VPAC 2 R cloning , initial studies demonstrated that this subtype was expressed in the hippocampus , thalamus , SCN , olfactory bulb , lung and colon ( Lutz et al . , 1993 ; Inagaki et al . , 1994 ) . Additional studies examining VPAC 2 R distribution in the CNS revealed a considerable expression in the cerebral cortex , periventricular nucleus , SCN , thalamus , hypothalamus and amygdala ( Sheward et al . , 1995 ; Vertongen et al . , 1998 ; Vaudry et al . , 2000 ) . Although both VPACR subtypes are reported to be co - expressed in many areas of the CNS , studies do however suggest that when this occurs the two subtypes have a complementary distribution , being found in different areas or layers of cells , e . g . in the olfactory bulb and cerebral cortex ( Usdin et al . , 1994 ; Vaudry et al . , 2000 ) . In 2004 , Harmar and co - workers performed an extensive study of VPAC 2 R distribution in mouse peripheral tissues and reported that this subtype was predominantly expressed in smooth muscle layers of organs and blood vessels . Moreover , the VPAC 2 R was also expressed in colonic mucosal epithelia , pancreatic acinar and thyroid follicular cells , the adrenal medulla , the retina and in lung alveoli as well as in blood vessels from many tissues ( Harmar et al . , 2004 ) . In 1993 when the PAC 1 R was ﬁ rst cloned , considerable receptor expression was observed in the brain ( Hashimoto et al . , 1993 ; Ogi et al . , 1993 ) , with a lower expression detected in lung and liver ( Hosoya et al . , 1993 ) . Several detailed studies of PAC 1 R distribution have since been reported , most of which have investigated the expression of generic PAC 1 R , with limited studies examining the distribution of speci ﬁ c splice variants . In the CNS , PAC 1 R expression has been reported in the olfactory bulb , hippocampus , area postrema , in cerebral , cerebellar , cingulate and entorhinal cortices , as well as in hypothalamic , amygdaloid , thalamic , raphe and SCN ( Hashimoto et al . , 1996a ; Vaudry et al . , 2000 ; Joo et al . , 2004 ; Kalamatianos et al . , 2004 ) . In peripheral tissues PAC 1 R expression has been reported in the pituitary , adrenal medulla , uterus , lymphoid tissue of the gut , testes and epididymis ( Shivers et al . , 1991 ; Reubi et al . , 2000 ; Vaudry et al . , 2000 ) . From the limited studies investigating the localisation of speci ﬁ c PAC 1 R variants , PAC 1 - null and PAC 1 - hop were shown to be the most highly expressed variants in brain tissue , with PAC 1 - hop speci ﬁ cally and predominantly expressed in the testes , olfactory bulb and adrenal glands ( Spengler et al . , 1993 ; Zhou et al . , 2000 ) . These studies also showed the PAC 1 - hip receptor to be expressed , albeit at lower levels than the null or hop variants , in the olfactory bulb and hippocampus . The PAC 1 - TM4 mRNA transcript was detected in the cerebral cortex , cerebellum , brainstem , vas deferens , lung and pancreatic β - cells ( Chatterjee et al . , 1996 ) , with the 21 aa ‘ short ’ deletion variant ( Pantaloni et al . , 1996 ) restricted to the pituitary , adrenal gland , hypothalamus and thalamus . The combined short - hop1 variant described by Braas and May ( 1999 ) , is the predominant variant expressed in SCG neurons , however the expression of this receptor in other tissues has not been examined . Finally , the PAC 1 ( 3a ) variant was originally localised to the testes by Daniel et al . ( 2001 ) , however a more recent study detected its presence in cultured newborn rat cortical astrocytes ( Pilzer & Gozes , 2006 ) . 2 . 9 . 1 . VPAC / PACR distribution in cells of the nervous system Following the isolation of the PACAP peptides , but prior to VPAC / PAC receptors cloning , PACAP binding sites were identi ﬁ ed on rat astrocytes ( Tatsuno et al . , 1990 ) . Since then , several studies ( RT - PCR , ISH ) have demonstrated the expression of VPAC 1 R , VPAC 2 R and PAC 1 R ( null , hop - 1 , hop - 2 , and ( 3a ) splice variants ) in cultured rat astrocytes ( Ashur - Fabian et al . , 1997 ; Grimaldi & Cavallaro , 1999 ; Jaworski , 2000 ; Pilzer & Gozes , 2006 ) . Cultured rat neurons have been shown to express VPAC 2 and PAC 1 - hop1 receptors ( Grimaldi & Cavallaro , 1999 ) , with microglia expressing VPAC 1 R and PAC 1 R , although the speci ﬁ c PAC 1 R variants have not yet been investigated ( Kim et al . , 2000 ; Delgado et al . , 2002 ) . Finally , Joo et al . ( 2004 ) have shown that PAC 1 R are expressed on oligodendrocytes , although this has yet to be con ﬁ rmed by any other study . 2 . 9 . 2 . Cancerous cells expressing VPAC / PACR As discussed earlier VPAC / PAC receptors appear to be highly expressed in a number of cancerous cell lines ( VPAC 1 R : HT - 29 , LoVo , HeLa cells ; VPAC 1 R : SUP - T1 , Molt - 4b , THP - 1 ; PAC 1 R : AR4 - 2 J , NB - OK - 1 , PC12 ) . In addition , epithelial neoplasms originating from a variety of organs express VIP / PACAP binding sites ( Vaudry et al . , 2000 ) . VPAC 1 R are the most commonly expressed VPAC / PACR in several malignant neoplasms , including those found in the lung , GI tract , breast , pancreas and liver ( Reubi , 2000 ; Busto et al . , 2003 ; Moody & Jensen , 2006 ) . In contrast , VPAC 2 R expression only predominates in a limited number of tumours , including benign smooth muscle tumours ( leiomyomas ; Reubi , 2000 ) . The PAC 1 R is predominantly expressed in several neuronal and endocrine tumours including gliomas , neuroblastomas , pituitary adenomas , phaeochromocytomas and prostate tumours 306 L . Dickson , K . Finlayson / Pharmacology & Therapeutics 121 ( 2009 ) 294 – 316 ( Vertongen et al . , 1996 ; Reubi , 2000 ; Lieu et al . , 2006 ; Mammi et al . , 2006 ; Muller et al . , 2006 ) . Several studies have investigated VPAC / PACR expression in neuroblastoma biopsies , where a high expression of PAC 1 R variants are generally found ( Vertongen et al . , 1996 ; Jaworski , 2000 ; Lutz et al . , 2006 ) , however there does appear to be considerable variability between samples . Isobe et al . ( 2004 ) described VPAC 1 R mRNA expression in a number of neuroblastoma biopsies ( 100 % of samples ) , with lower expression of VPAC 2 R ( ~ 30 % ) and PAC 1 R ( ~ 40 % ) . In immortalised cell lines derived from neuroblastomas , e . g . the SHSY - 5Y cell line , PAC 1 R appear to predominate ( Vertongen et al . , 1996 ; Lutz et al . , 2006 ) , with the latter study reporting that the PAC 1 δ 5 , 6 + null variant ( 21 aa deletion variant originally identi ﬁ ed by Pantaloni ) was the principal isoform expressed . 2 . 9 . 3 . Distribution of VPAC / PACR in cells of the immune system Generic VIP receptors were identi ﬁ ed on several types of immune cells , including lymphocytes and lymphoblasts prior to receptor cloning ( Section 2 . 5 ) . The identity of the VPAC / PAC receptors present on such cell types has since been clari ﬁ ed , with extensive studies performed by Delgado and colleagues ( reviewed by Gomariz et al . , 2001 ) . In summary , speci ﬁ c and constitutive VPAC 1 R expression has been demonstrated on thymocytes ( CD4 + , CD8 + ) , peripheral lympho - cytes and macrophages ( Delgado et al . , 1996b , c ) . In other studies by the same group , VPAC 2 R expressionwas only found on lymphocytes or macrophages following bacterial or viral exposure ( Delgado et al . , 1996a ; Lara - Marquez et al . , 2000 ) . Finally , PAC 1 R expression in the immune system appears very limited , with macrophages being the only cells shown to constitutively express this receptor subtype ( Pozo et al . , 1997 ) . 3 . Functions and roles of VIP / PACAP and their receptors Given the widespread distribution of VIP , PACAP and their cognate receptors , it is not surprising that they produce an extensive range of physiological effects . Early reports suggested that VIP and PACAP exerted a multitude of effects on cardiovascular , circulatory and respiratory systems and on metabolic function ( Said & Mutt , 1970 ; McCulloch & Edvinsson , 1980 ; Miyata et al . , 1989 , 1990 ) , with a number of more recent studies pointing to a plethora of putative roles in the nervous ( Dickinson & Fleetwood - Walker , 1999 ; Harmar et al . , 2002 ) and immune systems ( Pozo & Delgado , 2004 ; Gomariz et al . , 2001 ; Gonzalez - Rey et al . , 2007 ) . However , a large proportion of these studies have focused upon a limited number of areas , including circadian function , glucose homeostasis , neuroprotection and the modulation of the immune system . As for many peptides and their cognate receptors , clear insights into their physiological roles have recently been gained following the generation of transgenic animals . This has proven important in the VPAC / PACR ﬁ eld , particularly in the absence of low molecular weight , selective , non - peptide ligands . To date , transgenic mice have been developed with altered gene expression for VIP , PACAP , VPAC 2 R and PAC 1 R , with the outcomes discussed below . 3 . 1 . VIP transgenics Several different types of VIP transgenic mice have been reported , ranging from mice over - expressing ( OE ) the peptide to mice with reduced VIP expression and complete knock - outs ( KO ) ( Gozes et al . , 1993 ; Kato et al . , 1994 ; Colwell et al . , 2003 ) . Studies using these mice have focused primarily on their impact on pulmonary hypertension and on circadian function , of which the major ﬁ ndings shall be brie ﬂ y discussed below . Mice selectively over - expressing the human VIP gene in pancreatic β - cells ( the VIP gene was linked to an insulin promoter ) were generated by Kato and colleagues ( 1994 ) , with over - expression of VIP found to enhance glucose - induced insulin secretion , which led to a signi ﬁ cant reduction in blood glucose . In addition , VIP OE abolished glucose intolerance in mice that had a reduced functional pancreatic islet cell mass ( 70 % of pancreatic tissue had been removed ) . From these ﬁ ndings , the authors suggested that VIP - like peptides may be of therapeutic value in enhancing insulin secretion in diabetes ( Kato et al . , 1994 ) . The ﬁ rst of the VIP transgenic mouse lines with a reduced peptide expression was reported by Gozes et al . ( 1993 ) . In a mouse line with a 20 % reduction in brain VIP expression , the animals exhibited learning impairments including retardation in memory acquisition , with the male mice also showing reduced sexual activity ( Gozes et al . , 1993 ) . The ﬁ rst line of VIP KO mice was reported ten years later in 2003 by Waschek and colleagues , with the use of targeted homologous recombination in embryonic stem ( ES ) cells leading to complete disruption of the VIP gene . The resulting mice appeared healthy and fertile and were subsequently used in circadian function studies to determine the role of VIP in sleep / wake cycles . The intrinsic circadian rhythms of the KO mice ( determined under constant darkness ) were found to be weaker than wild - type ( WT ) littermates , with some cases of complete arrhythmicity ( Colwell et al . , 2003 ) . The KO mice also displayed altered entrainment to light cues , with these animals showing no phase shift in response to light pulses , highlighting the critical involvement of VIP in the mammalian circadian system . Extensive in vitro studies comparing activities of SCN neurons from these VIP KO with VPAC 2 R KO and WT mice have further detailed the role of VIP in controlling circadian cycles and shall be discussed in more detail in Section 3 . 3 ( Aton et al . , 2005 ) . Further studies using the same VIP KO line of mice suggested that these animals were more likely to die from experimentally induced endotoxemia than their WT littermates , to display symptoms of bronchial asthma and to develop pulmonary hypertension ( Hamidi et al . , 2006 ) . With respect to pulmonary hypertension , further studies by this group demonstrated that the KO mice had thickened muscle layers and a narrowed lumen in pulmonary arteries , as well as ventricular hypertrophy ( Said et al . , 2007 ) . Interestingly , these physical changes were reduced with VIP treatment ( over a 4 week period ) , with the authors subsequently suggesting VIP replacement therapy as a treatment for pulmonary hypertension . These results are supported by the earlier work of Petkov et al . ( 2003 ) , who reported that patients with pulmonary hypertension had low levels of VIP in both serum and lung tissue , and that VIP treatment ( over 3 months , daily inhalation of a total of 200 µg VIP ) reduced pulmonary arterial pressure ( Petkov et al . , 2003 ) . The importance of normal VIP expression in gut function has also been recently highlighted , with altered intestinal morphology , reduced intestinal motility and a higher risk of death from gut stenosis evident in this line of VIP KO mice ( Lelievre et al . , 2007 ) . In addition , studies have shown that although breeding success is not altered , male VIP KO mice have lower circulating concentrations of testosterone and in fact the altered hormone production appears to reduce normal testicular degeneration associated with ageing ( Lacombe et al . , 2007 ) . 3 . 2 . PACAP transgenics Studies describing PACAP transgenic mice have focused primarily on KO animals , with several groups generating independent lines through targeted disruption of the PACAP gene in ES cells . One of the ﬁ rst PACAP KO lines was described by Sherwood and colleagues ( 2001 ) , with these authors reporting that the KO mice appeared normal at birth , however the majority of pups died in the second postnatal week ( Gray et al . , 2001 ) . Interestingly , these KO were subsequently shown to be temperature sensitive , with the majority of mice surviving past weaning when housed in warmer conditions ( Gray et al . , 2002 ) . Following analysis of adipose tissue from the KO mice , the authors attributed this effect to a dependency on PACAP for normal adrenaline release from nerves in adipose tissue and subsequent stimulation of adipocyte thermogenesis . In the original 307 L . Dickson , K . Finlayson / Pharmacology & Therapeutics 121 ( 2009 ) 294 – 316 study , the KO pups had dif ﬁ culties in gaining weight , with these authors suggesting that PACAP played a role in lipid metabolism , given the observation that there was an accumulation of lipids in the heart , skeletal muscle and liver of the KO mice ( Gray et al . , 2001 ) . Recently published work by this group has shown that the decreased fat mass originally observed for the PACAP KO mice was not apparent when a high fat diet or warmer housing conditions were used ( 28 °C versus 21 °C ; Adams et al . , 2008 ) . The temperature sensitivity of the mice was shown not to be a result of altered food intake or levels of physical activity . From these studies , the authors concluded that PACAP was essential for normal energy homeostasis , playing a particularly important role in thermoregulation ( Adams et al . , 2008 ) . In agreement with Gray et al . ( 2001 ) , pups from a second KO line were also reported to have a considerable mortality rate , with ~ 50 % dying before weaning ( Hashimoto et al . , 2001 ) . Surviving adult mice exhibited hyperactive - like behaviours that included increased loco - motor activity , enhanced novelty related exploration and explosive jumping , leading to the proposal that PACAP may regulate psycho - motor responsiveness . In addition , homozygous matings of KO mice generally resulted in fewer successful pregnancies , with a speci ﬁ c role for PACAP in the female reproductive cycle subsequently delineated , with female mice shown to be less fertile , mating less frequently and also showing reduced crouching behaviour ( Shintani et al . , 2002 ) . The same group also examined circadian function in the KO mice , with these mice shown to have an intact SCN , no developmental complications and a similar free running period to their WT littermates ( Kawaguchi et al . , 2003 ) . These ﬁ ndings suggested that PACAP was unlikely to be necessary for the generation of endogenous circadian rhythms . However these studies did highlight an important role for PACAP in the light induced phase advance mechanism of the circadian clock ( Kawaguchi et al . , 2003 ) . More recently this group also investigated the role that PACAP plays in neuroprotection , by comparing the extent of damage in WT mice with PACAP hetero - zygotes and KO animals , following permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion ( Ohtaki et al . , 2006 ) . The infarct volume and neurological damage observed post insult was signi ﬁ cantly higher in the KO mice , suggesting a role for endogenous PACAP in preventing neuronal damage . Further studies indicated that the neuroprotective effect of PACAP may involve IL - 6 modulation of mitochondrial bcl - 2 expression and cytochrome C release ( Ohtaki et al . , 2006 ) . Baba ’ s group also examined the role of PACAP in pancreatic function by generating another transgenic line speci ﬁ cally OE the peptide in pancreatic β - cells , akin to the VIP line described earlier ( Kato et al . , 1994 ; Yamamoto et al . , 2003 ) . In contrast to the VIP OE mice , glucose levels were normal in the PACAP transgenics , suggesting a distinct role for the peptides in pancreatic function . Earlier studies with these mice which suggested a role for PACAP in stimulating feeding and energy homeostasis ( Nakata et al . , 2004 ) , have recently been presented in more detail ( Tomimoto et al . , 2008 ) . These authors described a crucial role for PACAP in energy homeostasis , with particular reference to lipid metabolism and body weight regulation . Consistent with Gray et al . ( 2001 ) , these KO mice had decreased adipose tissue mass , however , in contrast to Sherwood ' s group , reduced food intake and no accumulation of fat in organs was reported for the KO mice . Although both groups therefore agree that PACAP regulates energy homeostasis , further studies are needed to reconcile the different observations reported and to clearly de ﬁ ne the role of PACAP . Additional studies using Baba ' s line of PACAP KO mice have also suggested a role for PACAP in in ﬂ ammatory and neuropathic pain ( Mabuchi et al . , 2004 ) and in regulating the production of pro - in ﬂ ammatory cytokines ( Azuma et al . , 2008 ) . In a third line of PACAP KO mice , Hamelink et al . ( 2002 ) examined adrenal function , as PACAP had been proposed to act as co - transmitter with acetylcholine . This group found that despite basal adrenaline secretions appearing normal , the transgenic mice were unable to survive following a metabolic stress ( insulin induced hypoglycaemia ) which should stimulate prolonged adrenaline secretion ( Hamelink et al . , 2002 ) . The authors suggested that the mice were unable to recover from the initial hypoglycaemia and proposed a role for PACAP as an emergency response hormone during prolonged episodes of metabolic stress ( Hamelink et al . , 2002 ) . In the same mouse line , Chen and colleagues also investigated cerebral artery occlusion induced damage in PACAP KO and WT mice , however unlike Ohtaki et al . ( 2006 ) they also examined the effect of PACAP treatment following injury ( given 1 h post insult ; Chen et al . , 2006 ) . In WT mice , PACAP treatment reduced infarct volume and alleviated motor de ﬁ cits . In agreement with Ohtaki et al . ( 2006 ) , infarct volume and motor de ﬁ cits observed post insult were more severe in KO than WT mice ( Chen et al . , 2006 ) . However , upon PACAP treatment , these differences were no longer observed and the extent of damage was comparable in both lines of mice . PACAP treatment therefore appeared to reduce neuronal damage resulting from a lack of endogenous PACAP expression in the KO animals and afforded a degree of extra protection , equivalent to that oserved with the WT mice ( Chen et al . , 2006 ) . This work was extended by comparing the transcriptome from cortical samples from both lines of mice ( PACAP treated and control ) taken at 1 h and 24 h post insult . Multiple transcripts were reported to be PACAP depen - dent , with a larger number identi ﬁ ed in samples from the 24 h time - point ; these authors suggest a potential role for PACAP in late response to injury ( Chen et al . , 2006 ) . Following on from their circadian function studies in VIP KO mice ( 2003 ) , Colwell and colleagues performed similar investigations with PACAP KO mice ( Colwell et al . , 2004 ) . These mice showed less robust phase shifts ( approximately 50 % reduction compared to WT ) in response to light pulses , highlighting a speci ﬁ c role for the peptide in modulating advances and delays in the sleep / wake cycle in response to light and agreeing with a previous study ( Kawaguchi et al . , 2003 ) . The role of PACAP in in ﬂ ammationwas also investigated using animals from this KO line in a model of colitis ( Nemetz et al . , 2007 ) . The KO mice were reported to develop more severe symptoms including colonic in ﬂ ammation and in addition , were much more prone to developing colorectal tumours than WT littermates ( Nemetz et al . , 2007 ) . This group recently explored the links between PACAP and tumour growth in more detail ( Waschek et al . , 2006 ; Lelievre et al . , 2008 ) . In these studies , PACAP KO mice were crossed with ptc1 mice , which have a mutation in a single copy of the sonic hedgehog receptor gene patched - 1 . The ptc1 mice have been used as a model of Gorlin ' s syndrome as they phenotypically have a higher incidence of developing certain tumours , including medulloblastoma ( Lelievre et al . , 2008 ) . PACAP gene disruption was reported to further increase the prevalence of this tumour type in the double mutant mice ( double heterozygotes ) , pointing to an inhibitory role for the peptide in tumour development / growth . PACAP was also shown to inhibit , in a PKA dependent manner , proliferation of cells derived from tumours ( Lelievre et al . , 2008 ) . Future studies delineating the mechanisms involved in the PACAP , and presumed GPCR , interactionwith this sonic hedgehog pathway , will be of interest , particularly given the high expression of VPAC / PACR in cancerous cells ( Section 2 . 9 . 2 ) . In summary , multiple studies using PACAP transgenic mice have highlighted roles for the peptide in hyperactive psychomotor behaviours , mortality rates , energy homeostasis , tumour growth , lipid and glucose homeostasis , reproductive function , sleep / wake cycles , in ﬂ ammation and neuroprotection . These studies clearly demonstrate important and complex roles for this peptide in a multitude of physiological processes and highlight the potential clinical opportunities for novel , non - peptide , selective ligands . 3 . 3 . VPAC 2 R transgenics The ﬁ rst VPAC 2 R transgenic animals were reported in 2000 by Harmar and colleagues , who generated mice OE the human receptor ( Shen et al . , 2000 ) . The pattern of receptor distribution was similar to 308 L . Dickson , K . Finlayson / Pharmacology & Therapeutics 121 ( 2009 ) 294 – 316 that found in WT mice , with the highest levels of expression detected in the SCN . A role for the VPAC 2 R in controlling circadian cycles was presented , with the OE mice shown to adjust more rapidly than WT littermates to an 8 h phase advance in the light / dark cycle ( OE : 3 . 86 days ; WT : 5 . 4 days ) . In addition , the hVPAC 2 R - OE mice displayed a shorter circadian free running period ( OE : 23 . 36 h ; WT 23 . 59 h ) when assessed under conditions of constant darkness ( Shen et al . , 2000 ) . The following year , Voice et al . ( 2001 ) reported the generation of a secondhVPAC 2 Rtransgenicmouseline , inwhichtheT - cellsof themice constitutively expressed hVPAC 2 R . This expression contrasts with standard WT mice , with VPAC 2 R normally only detected upon T - cell stimulation ( see Section 2 . 9 . 3 ; Lara - Marquez et al . , 2000 ) . The highest levels of hVPAC 2 R expression were detected in the spleen and thymus , withsplenicT - cellsexhibitingahigherexpressionthanB - lymphocytes or macrophages ( Voice et al . , 2001 ) . Elevated serum levels of IgE , IgG1 and eosinophils were detected in these mice and were attributed to an increase in the effective ratio of functional Th2 and Th1 T - cells and associated cytokines ( IL - 4 , IL - 5 and interferon - γ ) . These authors showed that the altered balance in cytokine production resulted in a depression of delayed hypersensitivity reactions ( Voice et al . , 2001 ) . The ﬁ rst VPAC 2 R KO animals were described by Harmar and colleagues in 2001 and appeared normal in terms of general health , social behaviour and breeding patterns , although the mice were reported to show altered immune responses ( Goetzl et al . , 2001 ) . However , when delayed - type hypersensitive responses were induced in these mice ( through subcutaneous administration of the hapten 4 - hydroxy - 3 - nitrophenylacetic acid active ester ) , an enhanced respon - siveness was observed , in contrast to the results of Voice et al . ( 2001 ) . It was suggested that the differences resulted from an inability of VIP to increase the level of Th2 cells and associated cytokines ( relative to Th1 ) in these mice . It is clear that the VPAC 2 R plays an important role in immune hypersensitivity . Harmar and colleagues also examined the circadian characteristics of the VPAC 2 R KO mice and identi ﬁ ed a critical role for the receptor in the maintenance and expression of normal circadian activity ( Harmar et al . , 2002 ) . Under a standard 12 h light / dark cycle , VPAC 2 R KO mice had a similar pattern of activity to WT mice , however their overall activity levels were reduced . When exposed to a phase advance in the light / dark cycle the KO mice entrained to the new cycle much faster than WT animals ( KO : 2 . 4 days ; WT : 6 . 7 days ) . In addition , when exposed to brief periods of darkness during the daytime the KO mice became active , which contrasts with their WT littermates and demonstrated that masking by light was the principal factor governing their activity cycles . This ﬁ nding was underlined by the observation that under constant darkness the KO mice expressed very weak endogenous rhythms and lacked a coordinated clock gene expression in the SCN . Subsequent in vitro electrophysiological studies using tissue from these mice indicated there was a loss of electrical activity rhythms in SCN neurons , an observation that was mimicked in WT tissue following application of the putatively selective VPAC 2 R antagonist PG99 – 465 ( Cutler et al . , 2003 ) . Disruption to normal SCN function at the cellular level was also observed in the KO , with immunohistochemical studies showing the mice had no rhythmic expression of p - ERK or c - fos in SCN cells , which contrasts with WT littermates ( Hughes et al . , 2004 ) . Studies comparing SCN neuronal ﬁ ring rates from these mice with those from VIP KO and WT mice have further de ﬁ ned the importance of VIP and VPAC 2 R in normal circadian function ( Aton et al . , 2005 ) . Examination of neuronal ﬁ ring rhythms from both KO lines demonstrated that the majority of cells had multiple periods and impaired synchrony , in contrast to WT neurons which generally expressed a single period and synchronised ﬁ ring rhythms . Furthermore , application of the VPAC 2 R agonist Ro25 – 1553 restored rhythmicity to 71 % of VIP KO arrhythmic neurons . These studies highlight the VIP / VPAC 2 R contribution to circadian rhythm generation as being two fold — ﬁ rstly , maintaining rhythmicity in subsets of cells and secondly , maintaining synchrony between rhythmic neurons ( Aton et al . , 2005 ) . The most recent studies using this line of mice have explored the link between circadian cycles in the SCN and those in peripheral tissues ( Sheward et al . , 2007 ) . These studies demonstrated that in the absence of rhythmic SCN outputs , blood corticosterone levels , locomotor activities and hepatic clock gene expression of the KO mice were all rhythmic only when following a restricted feeding schedule . These authors suggest that the cycles observed are due to the in ﬂ uence of a ‘ food entrainable oscillator ’ , which can control peripheral circadian cycles indepen - dently of the SCN ( Sheward et al . , 2007 ) . A second line of VPAC 2 R KO mice were independentlygenerated by Asnicar and colleagues in 2002 , with these authors investigating the role of the VPAC 2 receptor in energy balance and glucose homeostasis . These mice had reduced levels of body fat and became progressively leaner than their WT littermates with age . These authors also reported reduced fertility rates in older male mice , due to degeneration of seminiferous tubules ( Asnicar et al . , 2002 ) , an effect not noted in the original studies ( Goetzl et al . , 2001 ) . 3 . 4 . PAC 1 R transgenics The ﬁ rst reported PAC 1 R KO mice were created by Jamen et al . ( 2000 ) , following targeted homologous recombination in ES cells . These authors found that the KO mice had impaired glucose - induced insulin secretion and increased glucose intolerance . The KO mice also weighed signi ﬁ cantly less ( ~ 10 % ) than their WT counterparts , clearly highlighting the importance of the PAC 1 R in glucose homeostasis . Interestingly , although the PAC 1 R KO mice appeared normal at birth , ~ 60 % died from unknown causes at about four weeks of age ( Jamen et al . , 2000 ) . These mice were also tested in a range of behavioural tasks to determine the effect of removing PAC 1 R from the hippocam - pus ( Sauvage et al . , 2000 ) . The KO mice displayed no de ﬁ cits in accuracy inwater maze tasks , suggesting that the PAC 1 R does not have a critical or major role in memory formation . However , a more subtle role for the PAC 1 R was identi ﬁ ed , with minor differences observed in contextual fear conditioning studies . The circadian activity of these mice was also examined and in a 12 h light / dark cycle , the circadian pattern of activity of KO and WT mice was similar , however in constant darkness , the KO mice had a signi ﬁ cantly shorter period length ( KO : 23 . 3±0 . 1 h ; WT : 23 . 7±0 . 1 h ; Hannibal et al . , 2001 ) . In response to light pulses in the early night , KO mice demonstrated large phase delays , which were more pronounced than WT mice , suggesting the SCN of the KO mice was more sensitive to light stimulation . In addition , the normal increase in clock genes ( e . g . c - fos , mPer2 ) in response to light was not observed in KO mice following light stimulated phase shifts , indicating that altered cycles of clock gene expression are not always observed in response to phase shifts in the sleep / wake cycle ( Hannibal et al . , 2001 ) . In more recent studies , the same group have extended their characterisation of this PAC 1 R KO line by examining the effect on VIP rhythms in the SCN ( Georg et al . , 2007 ) . In a 12 h light / dark cycle , the pattern of VIP mRNA expression in the SCN was identical in both PAC 1 R KO and WT mice , being diurnal in both groups . Under constant darkness , the VIP mRNA expression in both groups of mice remained diurnal , however a shorter phase delay was observed in the KO mice compared to WT littermates . These authors suggested that the shorter phase delay may be related to their previous ﬁ ndings demonstrating PAC 1 R KO mice to have shorter free running period ( Hannibal et al . , 2001 ) . The amplitude of VIP mRNA expression in 24 h darkness was also considerably lower in the KO mice , indicating that signalling via PAC 1 R in the SCN may in ﬂ uence VIP gene transcription ( Georg et al . , 2007 ) . The modulation of VIP expression by PAC 1 R is consistent with earlier studies from the group which showed that PACAP could increase VIP gene transcription in the predominantly PAC 1 R expressing NB - OK - 1 cell line ( Georg & Fahrenkrug , 2000 ) . 309 L . Dickson , K . Finlayson / Pharmacology & Therapeutics 121 ( 2009 ) 294 – 316 In 2001 , Otto and co - workers also described two PAC 1 R transgenic mouse lines and studied the role of this receptor in synaptic plasticity . The ﬁ rst was a full KO mouse line and the second was a novel transgenic in which only the PAC 1 R of the olfactory bulbs , cortical forebrain and hippocampus were inactive ( under the control of the Cre / loxP recombination system ) . In hippocampal slices from KO and WT mice , post tetanic stimulation was observed in the mossy ﬁ bre pathway , although sustained stimulation i . e . long term potentiation ( LTP ) , was only observed for WT mice ( Otto et al . , 2001 ) . In addition , both lines of transgenic mice showed impairments in contextual fear conditioning , whilst exhibiting no de ﬁ cits in spatial learning , consistent with the earlier ﬁ ndings of Sauvage et al . ( 2000 ) . These authors also noted differences in body weight between the KO and WT mice , with many transgenic animals dying within the second postnatal week ( Otto et al . , 2004 ) , again consistent with the original observations ( Jamen et al . , 2000 ) . Interestingly , the cause of death was suggested to be selective right heart failure , with these mice shown to have a high incidence of cardiac hypertrophy and a particularly pronounced dilatation of the right ventricle ( Otto et al . , 2004 ) . The most recent study describing PAC 1 R transgenic mice identi ﬁ ed a putative role for these receptors in the development of hydro - cephalus ( Lang et al . , 2006 ) . In three lines of transgenic mice OE PAC 1 R to different extents , enlarged ventricles and a reduced cerebral cortex mass was observed , with the severity being proportional to the degree of receptor OE . PAC 1 ROE in the developingembryowas also associated with a decrease in neuronal proliferation and an increase in apoptosis . The presence of abnormal cilia ( shorter and more disorganised than in WT ) in the ventricular ependyma was suggested to be partially responsible for the hydrocephalus - like effects seen in the transgenic mice . Interestingly , the PAC 1 R OE mice demonstrated growth retarda - tion and high pre - weaning death rates , two observations also reported for two lines of PAC 1 R KO mice ( Jamen et al . , 2000 ; Otto et al . , 2004 ) . Therefore the generation and characterisation of VIP / PACAP and VPAC / PACR transgenic mice have proven to be extremely useful in delineating some of their physiological roles . It is likely that further examination of the behaviour and physiology of these transgenic mice will provide new insights into VIP / PACAP and VPAC / PACR function . It is however intriguing to note that the PAC 1 R gain ( OE ) and loss of function ( KO ) mice both exhibit similar phenotypes in exhibiting growth retardation and high pre - weaning death rates ; a similar observation was made for VPAC2R transgenic lines , in their abilities to rapidly adapt to advances in light / dark cycles ( Shen et al . , 2000 ; Harmar et al . , 2002 ) . These observations are indicative of the complex and diverse physiological roles elicited by these receptor subtypes and how compensatory / alternative mechanisms are probably also evoked by genetic manipulation . 4 . Summary As discussed throughout this review , a large ﬁ eld of research has developed since the discovery of VIP and PACAP several decades ago . Cloning of the speci ﬁ c GPCRs for the peptides in the early 1990 ' s has greatlyadvancedourknowledgeregardingthefunctions , pharmacology and signalling pathways of the peptides / receptors . Theseadvances have subsequently led to the development of several useful peptide ligands ( e . g . PG97 – 269 , maxadilan ) and numerous transgenic mouse lines , including VIP , PACAP , VPAC 2 R and PAC 1 R null strains . The utilisation of such ligands and models has allowed the identi ﬁ cation of a wide range of important roles for the peptides and receptors under normal physiological conditions , and consequently , the modulation of the activity of these peptides / receptors has emerged as an attractive prospect in the treatment of numerous disease states . However , a key limiting factor to research in this ﬁ eld remains the paucity of truly receptor selective ligands , particularly non - peptides . Historically , many drug companies have found group B GPCR related drug discovery to be challenging , perhapsduetothestructuralcharacteristicsof thisreceptor family , and have been unprepared to take non - Lipinski like molecules through discovery and development ( Hoare , 2005 , Macarron , 2006 ) . With small molecule drug discovery pipelines drying up and many new peptide therapeutics appearing , it is likely that Pharma companies will re - evaluate peptide receptors as potential druggable targets . Indeed , several companies including Bayer , Senju , Abbot Laboratories and Senetek have developed interests in VIP and PACAP receptors in the last few years . Therefore , interest in VIP , PACAP and the VPAC / PAC receptors remains strong and future research should provide the information required for the development of such non - peptide ligands and facilitate the further understanding of the functions and roles of these interesting peptides and their cognate receptors .
