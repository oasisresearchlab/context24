However , its role in skeletal muscle differentiation is not known . To investigate possible involvement of PPAR c in skeletal muscle differentiation , we modulated its expression in C2C12 mouse skeletal muscle cells by stable transfection with sense or antisense plasmid constructs of PPAR c cDNA . Phenotypic observations and biochemical analysis of different myogenic markers showed that altered expression of PPAR c inhibited the formation of myotubes , as well as expression of muscle - speciﬁc myogenic proteins including myogenin , MyoD and creatine kinase activity . Together , we show that critical expression of PPAR c is required for skeletal muscle cells differentiation . Key words : myogenesis , PPAR c , skeletal muscle cells Introduction The development of skeletal muscle is a highly regulated process in which pluripotent mesodermal cells give rise to myoblasts that subsequently withdraw from the cell cycle and differentiate to form myotubes through temporally distinct sequence of events . Muscle cells undergo a distinct and well - characterized series of biochemical and morpho - logical changes during the process of differentiation i . e . myogenesis . The process leads to the induction of several differentiation - linked genes speciﬁcally expressed in muscle cells . At molecular level , myogenesis is controlled by a family of myogenic regulatory factors , which includes my - ogenin , muscle creatine kinase and MyoD that are expressed with a well - deﬁned time course [ 1 – 3 ] . Myoblasts align and fuse to form multinucleated myotubes . The endocrine fac - tors and signal transduction pathways that coordinate skel - etal muscle cell differentiation and expression of muscle - speciﬁc proteins [ 4 , 5 ] have been extensively studied [ 3 , 6 – 8 ] . However , the mechanisms and molecules that are temporally required for regulating the process of skeletal muscle differentiation are not fully understood [ 7 ] . Peroxisome proliferator - activated receptors ( PPARs ) are members of nuclear receptor superfamily [ 9 ] and regulate a large number of genes that are essential for lipid and met - abolic homeostasis and energy balance [ 10 ] . PPAR c is expressed predominantly in mature adipocytes and its role as a key transcriptional factor controlling adipocyte differ - entiation has been demonstrated [ 11 , 12 ] . Although very little amount of PPAR c is detectable in skeletal muscle cells * These authors contributed equally to this work .

(cid:1) Springer 2006 DOI 10 . 1007 / s11010 - 006 - 9256 - x ( 5 – 10 % of the expression observed in fat cells ) [ 13 – 17 ] , its physiological role in muscle is suggested by the fact that insulin sensitizers such as thiazolidinediones confer action on muscle as PPAR c ligand , the main site for insulin - stimulated glucose uptake [ 18 – 20 ] . Role of PPAR c in skeletal muscle differentiation is not clear . Earlier studies with genetic manipulation of PPAR c failed because com - plete elimination of functional PPAR c gene by knockout resulted in embryonic lethality [ 20 – 22 ] making PPAR c an essential gene for their survival . Role of PPAR c in the urothelial differentiation programme has been proposed [ 23 ] . Recently , an interaction between MyoD and PPAR c has been reported indicating a connection between PPAR c and MyoD [ 24 ] . However , whether PPAR c could mediate myogenic differentiation of skeletal muscle cells remains to be established . To elucidate a functional link between PPAR c expression and the induction of myogenic differentiation , we tested whether modulation of PPAR c expression can affect skeletal muscle cells differentiation . Results suggest that critical expression of PPAR c is required in the normal myogenic differentiation of skeletal muscle cells . To the best of our knowledge , this is the ﬁrst report , which establishes the relationship between skeletal muscle cell differentiation as a function of PPAR c expression .

Evans , The Salk Institute for Biological Studies , San Diego , CA , USA ) and inserted into the cloning site of the plasmid pCDNA3 . 1neo r ( Invitrogen ) in sense and antisense orien - tation with respect to CMV promoter ( sense , pCDNA3 . 1 - mPPAR c / + and antisense , pCDNA3 . 1 - mPPAR c / ) ) . Plas - mids were expanded in Escherichia coli ( strain DH5 a ) and isolated with Wizard Plus Midiprep DNA isolation kit ( Promega , Madison , WI , USA ) . Transfection C2C12 skeletal muscle cells in the exponential growth phase were transfected with PPAR - c sense or antisense plasmid construct using TransFast transfection reagent ( Promega , Madison , WI , USA ) , as described previously [ 6 ] . Brieﬂy , transfection reagent was incubated with plasmid DNA constructs in serum - free DMEM at room temperature for 15 min . This transfection mixture was applied to the proliferating cells and incubated for 1 h at 37 (cid:2) C . Following incubation , DMEM with 15 % FCS was overlaid on the plate and further incubated at 37 (cid:2) C . Selection drug ( G - 418 ) was applied to a ﬁnal concentration of 400 l g ml ) 1 after 24 h incubation and were maintained in a medium containing G - 418 until proliferating cells in the control plate had died ( approximately after 8 – 10 subculture ) . At this stage all the proliferating cells from the plates containing transfected cells were trypsinized , washed , and a part of the cells was continued with the subculturing without G418 and another part was subjected to differentiation , according to the pro - cedure described below . After differentiation , the cells were lysed and tested for the degree of expression of PPAR c protein . When expected results were obtained ( over expression in case of PPAR c / + transfected cells and under expression in PPAR c / ) transfected cells ) in the differenti - ated cells , the proliferated cells , which were being parallaly subcultured , were grown in bigger culture , frozen as stocks of stably transfected cell lines . As and when required cells were thawed from the stocks , subcultured 2 – 3 times , tested for degree expression of PPAR c in respective stable cell line and subjected to experimentation . Cell culture and induction of differentiation The C2C12 skeletal muscle cell lines ( wild type and trans - fectants ) were cultured as described previously [ 25 ] . Brieﬂy , they were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 15 % FCS and antibiotics ( penicillin 100 IU ml ) 1 , streptomycin 100 l g ml ) 1 ) in 5 % CO 2 at 37 (cid:2) C . When the cells achieved 70 % conﬂuency , they were differentiated in 2 % horse serum for 3 days . Under these conditions , cells were found to be healthy , viable and not undergoing necrosis or apoptosis , as 164 observed under phase contrast microscope ( Fig . 1 ) and trypan blue staining ( data not shown ) . Moreover , all three kinds of cells were found to be capable of signiﬁcant amount of glucose uptake [ 26 ] . Cell counting for determination of fusion index Fusion index of the myotubes were calculated as described previously [ 27 ] with minor modiﬁcations . Brieﬂy , cells were grown over cover slips , ﬁxed with paraformaldehyde ( 3 % , w / v ) and stained with 10 l g ml ) 1 propidium iodide ( PI ) . The total number of nuclei and the number of nuclei incorporated in myotubes were scored in 10 microscopic ﬁelds / dish chosen at random . The fusion index was calcu - lated as the percentage of nuclei incorporated in the myo - cytes relative to the total number of nuclei . Preparation of cell lysates and Western - immunoblotting Cells were lysed and protein expression levels were ana - lyzed by Western - immunoblot analysis , as described previ - ously [ 25 ] . Equal amount of protein samples were resolved by sodium dodecyl sulphate poly - acrylamide gel electro - phoresis ( SDS - PAGE ) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes . The membranes were blocked with 5 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) and incubated with the indicated primary antibodies for 12 – 16 h , followed by 1 h incubation with alkaline phosphatase conjugated secondary antibody . The protein bands were visualized with BCIP / NBT as sub - strate . Creatine kinase ( CK ) assay The CK assay was performed , as described previously [ 6 ] . Brieﬂy , cells growing on 35 mm Petri plates were washed twice with ice - cold PBS . To each Petri plate , 40 l l of ice - cold 0 . 05 M glycylglycin ( pH 6 . 75 ) was added . Petri plates were kept at ) 20 (cid:2) C for 24 h . The cells were scrapped after thawing on ice , centrifuged at 16 , 000 · g for 10 min at 4 (cid:2) C and subjected to CK assay . The assay contained 10 mM glucose , 2 . 5 mM magnesium acetate , 0 . 5 mM ADP , 5 mM AMP , 0 . 4 mM NADP , 10 mM creatine phosphate , 1 U / ml hexokinase , 0 . 5 U / ml glucose - 6 - phosphate dehy - drogenase and freshly added 1 . 54 mg / ml dithiothreitol in 0 . 1 M glycylglycin ( pH 6 . 75 ) .

C2C12wt , C2PPAR c / + and C2PPAR c / ) cells were proliferated for 48 h after subculture . When cells reached to 70 % conﬂuency , they were differentiated for 3 days in differentiation medium containing 2 % horse serum and photographed . 165 adding 1 l g of protein in a total assay volume of 50 l l . The change in absorbance was measured at 340 nm up to 5 min using Lambda Bio 10 UV / vis spectrometer ( Perkin Elmner , USA ) . Immunoﬂuorescence microscopy Immunoﬂuorescence microscopy studies were carried out , as described previously [ 26 ] and visualized under ﬂores - cence microscope ( Nikon E600 , Japan ) . Densitometric analysis Densitometric analyses of the Western blots were done using Gel Doc 2000 equipped with Quantity One 1 - D analysis software ( Bio - Rad , USA ) as described previously [ 26 ] . The relative values of the samples were determined by giving an arbitrary value of 1 . 0 to the respective control samples of each experiment , keeping the background value as 0 . Statistical analysis The data are expressed as mean ± standard error of mean ( s . e . m . ) .

Results C2C12 is well - characterized cell culture model used to study skeletal muscle differentiation . Under conditions permissive for differentiation , such as low serum concen - tration , C2C12 myoblasts undergo differentiation to form myotubes . We have previously established cell lines derived from C2C12 myoblasts after stable transfection with sense ( C2PPAR c / + ) or antisense ( C2PPAR c / ) ) plasmid constructs of mouse PPAR c in order to study its role in insulin resis - tance [ 26 ] . By Western - immunoblot analysis , we have shown that stable transfection of C2C12 skeletal muscle cells with sense or antisense plasmid constructs of PPAR c signiﬁcantly modulated the level of PPAR c expression with 28 . 57 % increase in C2PPAR c / + cells or 23 . 07 % decrease in C2PPAR c / ) cells as compared to C2C12wt [ 26 ] . Using these cell lines , present studies were designed to analyze the potential effect ( s ) of PPAR c expression on skeletal muscle cell differentiation . To investigate the effect ( s ) of PPAR c expression in skel - etal muscle differentiation , wild type and transgenic C2C12 myoblasts ( C2C12wt , C2PPAR c / + and C2PPAR c / ) ) were incubated under conditions permissive for differentia - tion and cultures were examined daily . When cultured in DMEM growth medium containing 15 % FCS , all the three cell lines mentioned above proliferated normally ( Fig . 1 ) . When these cells were incubated for 3 days in differentiation medium containing 2 % horse serum , extensive myotube formation was observed in C2C12wt cells adopting a spindle shaped morphology and membrane fusion to form multinucleated myotubes , as expected under these condi - tions ( Fig . 1 ) . Similar results were obtained in cells that contained vectors without the inserted gene ( data not shown ) . In contrast , C2C12 cells either overexpressing ( C2PPAR c / + ) or inhibited PPAR c ( C2PPAR c / ) ) expression exhibited a marked reduction in their ability to form myotubes ( Fig . 1 ) . To visualize the nuclei , cells were stained with propidium iodide ( Fig . 2A ) . In C2C12wt cells , majority of them were multinucleated ( Fig . 2A ) with average number of nucleus in each myotubes being 13 . 2 ± 1 . 28 ( Fig . 2B , lane 1 ) and the fusion index was calculated to be 38 . 75 ± 1 . 6 ( Fig . 2C , lane 1 ) . However , in C2PPAR c / + or C2PPAR c / ) cells , majority of them were mononucleated ( Fig . 2A , B ) and the fusion index was decreased to 3 . 8 ± 0 . 92 and 4 . 2 ± 1 . 4 respectively ( Fig . 2C , lanes 2 and 3 ) . Thus , data shows that altered expression of PPAR c repressed the myogenesis process in C2C12 cells . To further establish these observations , the phenomenon was investigated biochemically by the determination of myogenin and MyoD expression levels and creatine kinase activity , as they are known muscle differentiation markers [ 27 – 29 ] . During differentiation , these myogenic factors activates muscle - speciﬁc genes and coordinate withdrawal from the cell cycle [ 4 ] . It has been well established that expression of myogenin , an early marker for the entry of myoblasts into the differentiation pathway occurs only in post - mitotic myocytes and is expressed between 8 and 24 h of the in vitro initiation of differentiation [ 2 , 7 , 30 , 31 ] . Therefore , our initial interest was to determine whether myogenin expression is affected due to alteration of expression of PPAR c in C2C12 skeletal muscle cells . To this end , all the three cell lines ( C2C12wt , C2PPAR c / + and C2PPAR c / ) ) were incubated for 24 h under conditions for differentiation ( DMEM containing 2 % horse serum ) and the level of myogenin expression was examined by Western - immunoblotting ( Fig . 3 ) . Myogenin expression was not detected in proliferating myoblasts of all the three cell lines ( data not shown ) , which was expected [ 2 , 32 , 33 ] . C2C12wt cells differentiated in 2 % horse serum medium showed high level of myogenic expression ( Fig . 3 , lane 1 ) . In contrast , the level of myogenin expression was very low in C2PPAR c / + ( 6 . 4 % of C2C12wt ) ( Fig . 3 , lane 2 compared to lane 1 ; p < 0 . 01 ) or in C2PPAR c / ) cells ( 4 . 4 % of C2C12wt ) ( Fig . 3 , lane 3 compared to lane 1 ; p < 0 . 01 ) . 166 Proliferating myoblast showed no detectable CK activity ( data not shown ) ; however , CK activity was detectable after day 1 of culture in differentiation medium . In C2C12wt cells , CK activity increased by about 3 . 5 - fold from day 1 to day 3 when incubated in differentiation medium ( Fig . 4 , lanes 7 compared to lane 1 , p < 0 . 01 ) , which was consistent with our previously reported results [ 25 ] . However , when C2PPAR c / + or C2PPAR c / ) cells were incubated in differ - entiation medium , the CK activity was constantly lower than that detected in C2C12wt cells for the entire 3 days period of differentiation ( Fig . 4 ) . C2PPAR c / + cells showed 3 . 5 - fold and 4 . 5 - fold less activity than C2C12wt after day 2 and day 3 , respectively ( Fig . 4 , lane 5 compared to lane 4 and lane 8 compared to lane 7 ; p < 0 . 01 ) , whereas C2PPAR c / ) cells showed 3 . 3 - fold and 4 . 1 - fold less activity than C2C12wt after day 2 and day 3 , respectively ( Fig . 4 , lane 6 compared to lane 4 and lane 9 compared to lane 7 ; p < 0 . 01 ) . To determine the degree of MyoD expression , all the three cell lines were incubated in the differentiation medium for 3 days . Cells were lysed and Western immunoblotted using anti - MyoD antibody ( Fig . 5A ) . Marked reduction of MyoD expression was observed in C2PPAR c / + or C2PPAR c / ) cells as compared to C2C12wt cells ( Fig . 5A , lanes 2 and 3 compared to lane 1 ; p < 0 . 01 ) . The expression of MyoD was also monitored by immunoﬂuorescence microscopy . Cells growing on coverslips were incubated in differentiation medium for 3 days and subjected to immu - noﬂuorescence microscopy analysis probing anti - MyoD antibody and visualized by FITC labeled secondary anti - body . Immunoﬂuorescent image showed that the expression of MyoD was greatly inhibited in cells with altered PPAR c expression ( C2PPAR c / + or C2PPAR c / ) ) ( Fig . 5B ) . Thus , data show that alteration of PPAR c expression in C2C12 cells repressed the myogenesis process . These observations suggest that the critical level of expression of PPAR c is required for normal differentiation of skeletal muscle cells . Any alteration in the PPAR c expres - sion in skeletal muscle may cause faulty differentiation .

Muscle - speciﬁc PPAR c deﬁcient mice have been shown to develop insulin resistance [ 16 , 17 ] . PPAR c is required in mature white and brown adipocytes for their survival in the mouse [ 36 ] . It has been shown in vitro that PPAR c is required for differentiation of adipose cells from embryonic stem cells and from embryonic ﬁbroblasts [ 37 ] . These studies have led to re - interpret the role of PPAR c in the control of cellular physiology and prompted us to investigate whether PPAR c is required for skeletal muscle cell development and differentiation . Recently , we have shown that inhibition of muscle PPAR c expression caused insulin resistance in vitro [ 26 ] . Overexpression of PPAR c sensitized the cells to insulin causing more glucose uptake even under insulin resistant conditions [ 26 ] . However , the cells with alerted PPAR c expression could not differentiate properly . In cultured cell systems , it has been possible to observe the activation of inappropriate programme of gene expression . In this study , alteration in the expression of PPAR c completely blocked muscle differentiation and prevented transcriptional activa - tion of muscle - speciﬁc genes by the myogenic activators myogenin , MyoD and creatine kinase , which are directly linked to cell cycle regulating proteins and are regulators of skeletal muscle differentiation . The ability to form myotubes was completely lost if the expression of PPAR c was altered . This suggests PPAR c ‘s role as myogenic transcriptional regulators . To date there are no report of the role of PPAR c in skeletal muscle differentiation . It appears from present studies that critical expression of PPAR c is necessary to maintain differentiation in skeletal muscle cells . Long - term expression or activation of PPAR c may result in modulation of different subsets of differentiation related genes . The mechanism whereby PPARs may participate in different cellular processes is still not clear but may involve different substrates , which needs to be addressed . This suggests PPAR c ‘s role as myogenic transcriptional regulators . The three PPAR subtypes identiﬁed PPAR a , PPAR d ( also called b ) , and PPAR c ( c 1 , c 2 , and c 3 isoforms ) exhibit unique as well as overlapping tissue - speciﬁc expression and ligand activation proﬁles , and regulate physiological pro - cesses [ 38 – 40 ] .

However , the normal function of PPARs remains unclear . PPAR c is expressed predominantly in mature adipocytes and its role as a key transcriptional factor controlling adi - pocyte differentiation has been demonstrated [ 43 – 46 ] . Per - oxisome proliferation ( PP ) family of nuclear receptors are PPAR a , PPAR c , and PPAR d . PP is mediated by PPAR a , that regulate the expression of genes associated with lipid metabolism and adipocyte differentiation . PPAR c is involved in adipogenesis and differentiation , but the events do not directly involve peroxisomes and peroxisome pro - liferation . PPARs heterodimerize with 9 - cis - retinoic acid receptor ( RXR ) , and bind to PP response element ( s ) ( PPREs ) on the target gene promoter to initiate transcrip - tional activity . There are tissue - and species - speciﬁc responses that depend on relative abundance of PPAR , PPRE , the degree of competition and / or cross - talk among nuclear transcription factors , pharmacokinetics and modu - lations of coactivators and corepressors on ligand - dependent transcription of PPARs [ 47 ] . Zhu and Reddy [ 47 ] have identiﬁed PPAR coactivators like steroid receptor coactiva - tor - 1 ( SRC - 1 ) and PPAR - binding protein ( PBP ) . PPAR c coactivator - 1 a ( PGC - 1 a ) , a coactivator at the transcriptional level is speciﬁcally expressed in skeletal muscle . The expression of PGC - 1 a in muscle is regulated by two tran - scription factors , MEF2 and FKHR , implicated in terminal differentiation of muscle [ 48 , 49 ] . In both C2C12 and Sol8 myoblasts , Chang et al . [ 49 ] observed that myogenic bHLH proteins , MyoD , activated PGC - 1 a expression in vivo , which in turn was activated during terminal muscle differ - entiation . These results directly implicated the activation of the key ﬁbre - type and metabolic switch gene PGC - 1 a . PGC - 1 a and PGC - 1 b regulate PPAR a [ 50 ] . Identiﬁcation of additional coactivators that may be responsible for cell - speciﬁc transcriptional activation of PPAR - mediated target genes will be necessary to gain more insight into the responses regulated by PPAR . We have provided evidences for a cellular control component that regulate muscle - spe - ciﬁc proteins . PPAR c conceivably participates through a variety of known and / or yet unknown coactivators , as discussed above . It may affect the myogenic factors in the regulatory networks that convey inhibitory signals in myo - blasts to the important myogenic control factors present in the nucleus . In this connection , it is important to assemble a complete picture of signaling pathways triggered by pro - liferative and differentiation factors , and the mechanisms that coordinate these processes leading to muscle diff - erentiation . This understanding , together with greater physiological knowledge of the impact of certain gen - etic manipulations in vivo , is essential to design future approaches for the treatment of skeletal muscle diseases and for the prevention of or recovery from muscle loss in situ - ations such as cachexia , muscle wasting or sarcopenia . From a pathophysiological point of view , it may be essential to ensure that PPAR c expression is not altered as it may alter sequence of events in the repair of injured muscles during A 1 2 3 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 12 3 R e l a t i ve M y o D ex p r ess i on MyoD β - tubulin Cc22C12wt C2PPAR V / + C2PPAR V / - B * * C2PPAR γ / - C2PPAR γ / + C2C12wt Fig . 5 .
