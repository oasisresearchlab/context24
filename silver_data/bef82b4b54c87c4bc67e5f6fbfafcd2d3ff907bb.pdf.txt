Information exploration systems expand the current context by suggesting novel but related concepts . In this paper we introduce InspirationWall , an unobtrusive display that leverages speech recognition and information ex - ploration to enhance an ongoing idea generation session with automatically retrieved concepts that relate to the conversa - tion . We evaluated the system in six idea generation sessions of 20 minutes with small groups of two people . Prelimi - nary results suggest that InspirationWall contrasts the decay of idea productivity over time and can thus represent an ef - fective way to enhance idea generation activities .

HCI ) : Miscellaneous INTRODUCTION Collecting and navigating through information is an impor - tant phase in creative processes [ 13 ] , which fosters associa - tive and inspirational learning [ 2 ] . Previous work that sought to support for example brainstorming referred to the semantic network structure of human memory , where concepts feature as nodes with associative links [ 15 ] . In brainstorming , one cognitive operation to generate ideas is to retrieve concepts from associative memory . Expanding the current context of topics has been investigated through topic suggestion algo - rithms designed to generate candidate topics that are novel but related to the current context [ 9 ] . As brainstorming is often a collaborative practice , recent creativity systems sup - port groups .

InspirationWall is an unobtrusive display supporting idea gen - eration by leveraging speech recognition and automatic information ex - ploration . It monitors users’ discussion and automatically suggests key - words to support their idea generation . in a variety of tasks [ 6 ] . Group brainstorming can be effec - tive in generating creative ideas as suggested by cognitive ap - proaches [ 3 ] , and technology may help minimizing the effect of negative social processes [ 5 ] . A beneﬁcial feature in group brainstorming is the ability to detect the context and content of the brainstorming through utterances of participants . Idea - Expander [ 14 ] is a tool to support group brainstorming by intelligently selecting pictorial stimuli based on the group’s conversation on a chat . The pictures generally enhanced per - formance as measured by both originality and diversity of ideas [ 15 ] . Less investigated are face to face systems in group sessions that suggest keywords instead of pictures . Systems suggesting keywords and topics have recently been applied successfully to improve exploratory search processes [ 1 , 10 ] . Such systems predict the current intent model of the user in the exploration and suggest possible explorations . These ap - proaches have also been found useful in avoiding keyword input by selecting and manipulating suggested keywords by touch [ 8 ] . The present work investigate further alternative in - put modalities such as speech to text that permit the system to run in the background without interrupting the creative pro - cess but providing a continuous resource . 103 Figure 2 .

SYSTEM DESIGN InspirationWall is a non - intrusive source of diverse ideas ( Figure 1 ) . It was designed as a low - key visual aid , as to not interfere with the user’s idea generation process . In - spirationWall continuously monitors the discussions through a conference microphone and the input to the system is recorded from users natural interaction via speech recogni - tion . Speech recognition is performed in real - time using Googles implementation of the HTML5 Web Speech API [ 16 ] . Recognized expressions are processed by an entity - based keyword suggestion system that returns related keywords by discovering associated and novel information related to the input [ 11 ] . Returned keywords are then displayed as slowly crossing the screen from top to bottom as to allow a progres - sive refreshing of displayed keywords . The graphical inter - face of Inspiration Wall is minimal : it runs fullscreen with a black background . Keywords are displayed in white . Ev - ery two seconds providing the keyword buffer is not empty a new keyword appears at the top of the screen at a random horizontal position and falls slowly towards the bottom of the screen . Keyword Suggestion System As the set of potential keywords matching any part of users’ discussion is likely to be much higher than what can be pre - sented for the user , and the discussion can contain mislead - ing cues due to the natural dialogues that the system listens , we use a centrality - based ranking of the keywords in a large knowledge - graph . Intuitively , this approach allows the system to suggest central keywords that are related to the user input via the knowledge - graph rather than only suggesting keywords directly match - ing to the input . This can help discovering keywords that are highly relevant for the input , but at the same time cen - tral to the overall discussion [ 12 ] . The knowledge - graph G is undirected and labeled and consists of a disjoint union set of keywords and documents ( called nodes n ∈ G ) and the set of edges between the documents and the keywords . Each keyword in the graph is connected to a document it describes . For example , an article about ”relevance feedback for infor - mation retrieval” could be described with a set of keywords , such as ”information retrieval” , ”relevance feedback” , ”im - plicit feedback” , ”web search” , and so on . In addition , we index the text of the articles that is used to retrieve an initially relevant set of documents from which the knowledge - graph is constructed . The user’s query consists of one or more words detected via the speech recognition system . A set of keywords detected are called preference keywords q ∈ G in the graph , where | q | = 1 and q j denotes the preference for keyword j . In our case no weighting is conducted for the keywords so the pref - erence is uniformly distributed over for the given keywords in q . We use the personalized PageRank method [ 7 ] to compute the ranking of the nodes given the q . It can be then formalized as follows . Let an individual node be denoted as n , and by I ( n ) and O ( n ) denote the set of in - neighbors and out - neighbors of n in G respectively . Let A be the matrix corresponding to the graph G , where A ij = 1 | O ij ∪ I ij | if the node i links to the node j or vice versa , and A ij = 0 otherwise . For a given q , the personalized PageRank equation can be written as v = ( 1 − c ) Av + cq , where c = 0 . 15 is the teleportation rate . The solution v is a steady - state distribution of random surfers , where a surfer teleports at each step to a node n with probability c · q ( n ) , or moves to a random neighbor otherwise . We compute the steady distribution by using the power iteration method with 100 iterations . The weights of the v are directly used in ranking the key - words . As the size of our knowledge - graph is hundreds of millions of nodes , the computation is not possible on - line for the complete graph . To make the PageRank computation fea - sible with an acceptable latency , we approximate the set of nodes to be included in the initial graph by using a language 104 0 5 10 15 20 S1 0 4 8 12 16 20 24 0 5 10 15 20 0 4 8 12 16 20 24 S6 0 10 20 30 40 0 4 8 12 16 20 24 S2 10 20 30 50 40 0 0 4 8 12 16 20 24 2 4 6 10 8 0 0 4 8 12 16 20 24 S5 2 4 6 8 12 10 0 0 4 8 12 16 20 24 S4 S3 BL IW Figure 3 .

EVALUATION We designed an experiment to evaluate the effect of the sys - tem on the idea generation process . The goal of the exper - iment was ( 1 . ) to understand if and how InspirationWall helped small groups generating more ideas , and ( 2 . ) to assess the overall effectiveness of the system as a creativity support tool using standard metrics . Participants The evaluation was conducted in groups of two persons ( Fig - ure 2 ) . We recruited twelve participants ( six pairs ) with expe - rience in idea generation activities from the computer science departments of two universities . Three of the participants were females and the mean age was M = 28 . 33 , SD = 3 . 98 . To simulate more natural discussions and brainstorming ac - tivity , we ensured that participants in the same pair knew each other . Participants were non - native English speakers from different countries and cultures ( Iran , Canada , Spain , Nepal , Italy , Turkey , Sri Lanka , Rwanda , Kenya ) with a similar level of proﬁciency in oral English . Their levels of education were : 25 % PhD , 67 % Master , 8 % Bachelor . Participants received two movie tickets as a compensation for their participation . Tasks We used a within - group design , where groups were asked to perform two tasks : one with the support of InspirationWall and one without external support . We counterbalanced by changing the order in which the two tasks were performed and the order in which the groups were subjected to each con - dition . The task was created to support an idea generation scenario and formulated as follows : Imagine you have to come up with novel student projects on topic X . Please generate as many ideas as possible for new technologies , interaction tech - niques , methodologies , application scenarios , and so on , that might be used as more speciﬁc topics of the projects on topic X . Two topics were used in the evaluation sessions : ( 1 . ) Robotics , and ( 2 . ) Wearable computing . Metrics and Results Quantity of Ideas Since we were interested to check whether our application inﬂuenced the number of ideas generated , we have looked to the cumulative number of ideas considering time and ses - sion ( Table 1 ) . In total , the six groups have produced 107 ( M = 30 . 57 , SD = 12 . 24 ) ideas without external support and 136 ( M = 38 . 86 , SD = 14 . 99 ) using InspirationWall . In Figure 3 , it is shown the accumulation of ideas per con - dition in the sessions , considering intervals of 4 minutes . In addition , video recordings obtained from the camera placed between the participants and the InspirationWall display al - lowed us to count the occurrences of participants looking at the screen ( results shown in Figure 4 ) . It is interesting to ob - serve that the three groups ( S1 , S3 and S6 ) that have looked at the display the most , improved their performance with re - spect to the baseline condition , presenting a higher number of generated ideas and a more constant productivity . Creativity Support Index To measure the performance of our system in terms of cre - ativity support , we involved participants in the assessment of the Creativity Support Index ( CSI ) [ 4 ] . 10 20 30 40 60 50 0 S1 S2 S3 S4 S5 S6 Figure 4 .

The six factors that com - pose the CSI are : Collaboration , Enjoyment , Exploration , Expression , Expressiveness , Immersion and Results Worth Effort . Each pair of questions are weighted based in pair wise comparisons of the factors made by each participant . The result of the CSI was M = 53 . 36 , SD = 13 . 35 . The most important factors for the participants were Expressive - ness ( M = 3 . 58 , SD = 1 . 24 ) and Exploration ( M = 3 . 83 , SD = 0 . 94 ) . DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS Creative ideas are often triggered by unexpected associations . InspirationWall offers a quiet additional source of informa - tion to fuel the activity of collaborative idea generation . This paper presents the implementation and a preliminary evalu - ation of such a system . Participants were asked to gener - ate ideas but not explicitly to use or interact with the system which was simply provided as is . Our study shows that par - ticipants that used InspirationWall more – as indicated by the count and duration of gazing occurrences obtained through video analysis – tended to generate more ideas in total and over time . Those results suggest that InspirationWall con - trasts the decay of idea productivity over time typical of tra - ditional idea generation sessions . Although the CSI does not show a high value , it is still above the median value of the scale , with the most important factors for the participants be - ing Expressiveness and Exploration . Such results conﬁrms the effectiveness of automatic information exploration and keyword suggestion on idea generation , opening a variety of directions for future work , including for example application to other datasets , and allowing richer interactions with the system through touch . The novel approach on idea genera - tion support described in this paper , the simple design of our prototype and the positive results of this preliminary study are the contributions of our work to the future of digital tools for creativity support .
