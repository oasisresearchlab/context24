Understanding key time - to - event 3 periods for each emerging variant of concern is critical as it can provide insights into the future trajectory 4 of the virus and help inform outbreak preparedness and response planning . Here , we aim to examine how 5 the incubation period , serial interval , and generation time have changed from the ancestral SARS - CoV - 2 6 lineage to different variants of concern . 7 Methods : We conducted a systematic review and meta - analysis that synthesized the estimates of 8 incubation period , serial interval , and generation time ( both realized and intrinsic ) for the ancestral lineage , 9 Alpha , Beta , and Omicron variants of SARS - CoV - 2 . 10 Results : Our study included 274 records obtained from 147 household studies , contact tracing studies or 11 studies where epidemiological links were known . With each emerging variant , we found a progressive 12 shortening of each of the analyzed key time - to - event periods . Specifically , we found that Omicron had the 13 shortest pooled estimates for the incubation period ( 3 . 63 days , 95 % CI : 3 . 25 - 4 . 02 days ) , serial interval 14 ( 3 . 19 days , 95 % CI : 2 . 95 - 3 . 43 days ) , and realized generation time ( 2 . 96 days , 95 % CI : 2 . 54 - 3 . 38 days ) 15 whereas the ancestral lineage had the highest pooled estimates for each of them . We also observed shorter 16 pooled estimates for the serial interval compared to the incubation period across the virus lineages . We 17 found considerable heterogeneities ( I 2 > 80 % ) when pooling the estimates across different virus lineages , 18 indicating potential unmeasured confounding from population factors ( e . g . , social behavior , deployed 19 interventions ) . 20 Conclusion : Our study supports the importance of conducting contact tracing and epidemiological 21 investigations to monitor changes in SARS - CoV - 2 transmission patterns . Our findings highlight a 22 progressive shortening of the incubation period , serial interval , and generation time , which can lead to 23 epidemics that spread faster , with larger peak incidence , and harder to control . We also consistently found a 24 shorter serial interval than incubation period , suggesting that a key feature of SARS - CoV - 2 is the potential 25 for pre - symptomatic transmission . These observations are instrumental to plan for future COVID - 19 waves . 26 All rights reserved . No reuse allowed without permission .

Since the first detection of SARS - CoV - 2 ( the virus causing COVID - 19 ) in 6 Wuhan , China , in December 2020 the virus has started to evolve , and several variants of SARS - CoV - 2 7 have been identified . Five of them were classified as variants of concern ( VOCs ) : Alpha ( B . 1 . 1 . 7 ) , Beta 8 ( B . 1 . 351 ) , Gamma ( P . 1 ) , Delta ( B . 1 . 617 . 2 ) , and Omicron ( B . 1 . 1 . 529 ) [ 2 ] . Alpha and Delta were 9 particularly successful at spreading around the globe , causing major waves of infections and associated 10 hospitalizations since late 2020 and early 2021 [ 3 ] [ 4 ] . In late 2021 , Omicron was first detected in South 11 Africa and spread more rapidly than all other VOCs , causing massive outbreaks worldwide albeit with a 12 lower associated burden due to high vaccination levels [ 2 , 5 , 6 ] . As of March 2023 , Omicron is the 13 dominant variant worldwide . 14 15 Knowledge of the transmission dynamics of SARS - CoV - 2 VOCs is vital for understanding the 16 epidemiology of COVID - 19 and establishing effective control measures . In this context , three key 17 indicators are the incubation period , serial interval , and generation time . The incubation period is the 18 interval between an individual’s time of infection and symptom onset [ 7 ] ; the serial interval is the interval 19 between symptom onset of the infector and symptom onset of the infectee ( s ) [ 7 ] ; the generation time is the 20 interval between the infector’s time of infection and the infectee ( s ) ’s time of infection [ 8 ] . For example , 21 these three indicators are instrumental for defining the duration of quarantine and which contacts need to 22 be traced as well as providing insights into pre - symptomatic transmission . Moreover , in combination with 23 the reproduction number , they are key for properly interpreting epidemic growth and forecasting epidemic 24 timing [ 9 ] . 25 26 While many epidemiological investigations have estimated the incubation period , serial interval , and 27 generation time for the VOCs , these indicators can be affected by a variety of factors related to the specific 28 All rights reserved .

For this reason , it is 1 essential to combine these estimates to provide a more comprehensive picture of these indicators for the 2 different VOCs . However , previous reviews and meta - analyses on the incubation period , serial interval , 3 and generation time for SARS - CoV - 2 have not examined the evolution of these three indicators across the 4 different VOCs [ 13 , 15 - 23 ] . This information is essential for outbreak preparedness and response planning 5 as SARS - CoV - 2 continues to mutate and systematically comparing changes in these indicators can provide 6 insights into their possible future trajectory . Therefore , our objective in the present review is to 7 quantitatively synthesize estimates for the incubation period , serial interval , and generation time and 8 examine how these indicators have evolved over time from the ancestral lineage to the different VOCs . 9 10 Methods 11 Search Strategy 12 We conducted a systematic search following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 13 Meta - Analyses ( PRISMA ) guideline ( see PRISMA checklist ) [ 24 ] . We searched for studies published in 14 English on three peer - reviewed databases ( PubMed , Embase , and Web of Science ) and five preprint servers 15 ( medRxiv , bioRxiv , Europe PMC , SSRN , and arXiv ) using predefined search terms ( Supplementary Table 16 S1 ) . All searches were conducted on March 28 , 2023 . 17 18 Inclusion and exclusion criteria 19 Studies were included if they satisfied the following criteria : ( 1 ) provided at least one summarized statistic 20 ( e . g . , central tendency and dispersion ) for the incubation period , serial interval , or generation time ; ( 2 ) 21 relied on data from a contact tracing study , a household study or a study where epidemiological links were 22 known . 23 24 We excluded studies that : ( 1 ) were meta - analyses and reviews , study protocols , media news , commentaries , 25 or the full text was unavailable ( e . g . , conference abstract ) ; ( 2 ) SARS - CoV - 2 variant / sub - variant or study 26 period not reported ; ( 3 ) carried out analysis with sample size less than five ; ( 4 ) were non - human studies ; ( 5 ) 27 All rights reserved .

We further divided the 4 generation time into two categories : intrinsic and realized . The intrinsic generation time represents the 5 generation time that would be observed in a fully connected infinitely large susceptible population in the 6 absence of interventions and behavioral change . The realized generation time refers to the generation time 7 that is observed in field condition and is thus affected by specific features of the study population ( e . g . , 8 interventions , individual behaviors , analyzed social settings ) [ 17 , 25 , 26 ] . 9 10 Data extraction 11 Study screening and data extraction were performed independently by authors YP . W . and X . X . , and 12 inconsistencies were reconciled together with a third author , Y . Z . For eligible studies , we extracted all 13 summary statistics related to the outcomes of interest , including mean , median , interquartile range ( IQR ) , 14 range , standard deviation , quantiles , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) , and 95 % credible interval ( CrI ) . In 15 addition , we collected descriptive data on the authors , article’s title , journal , date of publication , study 16 location ( country or region ) , date of the study period , total number of study subjects , variant type , and 17 methods used for estimating key time - to - event intervals . 18 19 Quality assessment 20 Two authors ( Z . H . and Y . Z . ) independently carried out the quality assessment of the included literature . 21 The quality assessment scale was adapted from the Newcastle - Ottawa quality assessment questions 22 ( detailed in the Supplementary Table S2 ) [ 16 ] . Disagreements between the two reviewers were resolved 23 together with a third author , X . X . 24 25 Data analysis 26 We described the central tendency ( mean or median ) and dispersion measure ( range , IQR , 95 % CI , or 27 95 % CrI ) for incubation period , serial interval , and generation time for the different VOCs via a forest plot . 28 All rights reserved .

For dispersion measures , we preferred standard deviation , followed by 95 % CI / CrI , IQR , and range . 2 3 Next , we conducted a meta - analysis for different SARS - CoV - 2 variants . The random - or fixed - effects 4 models were employed for the pooling analysis according to the heterogeneity test . Notably , if standard 5 deviation was not available but the parametric distribution of estimates was provided , we derived the 6 standard deviation from the parametric distribution . Otherwise , we used the 95 % CI , if available , to derive 7 the standard deviation using the formula 95 % CI = (cid:0)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4) (cid:5) 1 . 96 (cid:10) (cid:0)(cid:2) √(cid:4) . 8 9 For studies reporting only the median and its associated dispersion measure , the corresponding mean , 10 standard deviation , and 95 % CI were approximated using methods described in Luo et al . [ 27 ] . If a study 11 did not include a measure of central tendency or dispersion , the study was included in the review , but not 12 in the meta - analysis . These methods were implemented using R function metagen from package meta . The 13 pooled average estimates with 95 % CI were shown in forest plots . 14 15 We used a weighted t - test to assess the significance of the difference between the incubation periods , serial 16 intervals , and generation times of the ancestral lineage and the Alpha , Delta , and Omicron variants . 17 Weights were estimated as the inverse of the standard error , and a 2 - sided p - value was calculated from a t - 18 distribution using a bootstrap procedure to account for non - normality [ 28 ] [ 29 ] . 19 20 Publication bias was assessed using a funnel plot and Egger’s test . A 2 - sided P < 0 . 05 was considered 21 statistically significant . All analyses were performed in R ( version 4 . 1 . 0 . ) . This review was not registered . 22 23 Results 24 Search results 25 A total of 25 , 929 studies were identified based on our search strategy .

As per the inclusion / exclusion criteria , 147 2 studies were included in our analysis [ 7 , 8 , 17 , 26 , 30 - 172 ] , 7 of which were from preprint platforms . 3 Among the included studies , 92 studies provided incubation period estimates , 98 studies provided serial 4 interval estimates , and 21 studies provided generation time estimates . Sixty - three studies reported more 5 than one outcome ; 18 studies provided estimates for more than one virus lineage ( Figure 1 ) . 6 7 Study characteristics 8 We extracted 274 records for the focus key time - to - event periods from 147 included studies . Each record 9 contained at least one summary statistic of central tendency and dispersion measure of the outcome 10 variable ( s ) ( Table S4 - S7 in the Supplement ) . 11 12 We identified 109 ( 39 . 8 % ) records for incubation period from 92 studies ; the majority of which were based 13 on COVID - 19 data from China ( 66 [ 60 . 6 % ] ) . Sixty - nine ( 63 . 3 % ) studies focused on the ancestral lineage , 14 2 ( 1 . 8 % ) on the Alpha variant , 1 ( 0 . 9 % ) on the Beta variant , 20 ( 18 . 3 % ) on the Delta variant , and 17 15 ( 15 . 6 % ) on the Omicron variant . 16 17 For serial interval , we obtained 133 ( 48 . 5 % ) records from 99 studies . Nearly half of the records were from 18 China ( 46 [ 34 . 6 % ] ) and South Korea ( 14 [ 10 . 5 % ] ) . Seventy - one ( 53 . 4 % ) studies included focused on the 19 ancestral lineage , 4 ( 3 . 0 % ) on the Alpha variant , 29 ( 21 . 8 % ) on the Delta variant , and 29 ( 21 . 8 % ) on the 20 Omicron variant . 21 22 For the generation time , 32 ( 11 . 7 % ) records from 21 studies were included in our analysis , among them 23 were 27 records for the realized generation time and 5 records for intrinsic generation time . These records 24 were from China ( 12 [ 37 . 5 % ] ) , Italy ( 7 [ 21 . 9 % ] ) , UK ( 5 [ 15 . 6 % ] ) , Netherlands ( 4 [ 12 . 5 % ] ) , Singapore ( 2 25 [ 6 . 3 % ] ) , Germany ( 1 [ 3 . 1 % ] ) , and multiple countries ( 1 [ 3 . 1 % ] ) . Eleven ( 34 . 4 % ) studies focused on the 26 ancestral lineage , 5 ( 15 . 6 % ) on the Alpha variant , 10 ( 31 . 3 % ) on the Delta variant , and 6 ( 18 . 8 % ) on the 27 All rights reserved .

Sixty - eight studies included a well - 4 characterized cohort of individuals that were comparable with the population and provided precise 5 estimates for the symptom onset window for themselves and their potential infector ( s ) . 6 7 Incubation period 8 The ancestral lineage had the largest pooled mean incubation period ( 6 . 46 days , 95 % CI : 5 . 86 - 7 . 07 days ) , 9 followed by the Alpha variant ( 4 . 92 days , 95 % CI : 4 . 53 - 5 . 30 days ) , the Delta variant ( 4 . 63 , 95 % CI : 4 . 11 - 10 5 . 15 days ) , and the Omicron variant ( 3 . 63 days , 95 % CI : 3 . 25 - 4 . 02 days ) ( Figure 2 , Figure S1 ) . Only one 11 study reported an estimate for the incubation period of the Beta variant ( median : 4 . 5 days , IQR : 2 - 7 days ) . 12 Each VOC had a significantly shorter incubation period than the ancestral lineage ( p - values : < 0 . 001 , 13 < 0 . 001 , < 0 . 001 for Alpha , Delta , and Omicron , respectively ) . Over the course of the pandemic , the central 14 tendency of the incubation period decreased by 23 . 8 % from the ancestral lineage to Alpha ( p - value : 15 < 0 . 001 ) , 21 . 5 % from Delta to Omicron ( p - value : 0 . 006 ) , and there was no significant difference between 16 Alpha and Delta ( p - value : 0 . 321 ) . Our results suggested no potential publication bias in the included 17 studies ( p - value : 0 . 0769 ) ( Figure S5 in the Supplement ) . 18 19 Serial interval 20 The ancestral lineage had the largest pooled mean serial interval ( 4 . 80 days , 95 % CI : 4 . 48 - 5 . 11 days ) , 21 followed by the Alpha variant ( 3 . 47 days , 95 % CI : 2 . 52 - 4 . 41 days ) , the Delta variant ( 3 . 59 days , 95 % CI : 22 3 . 26 - 3 . 92 days ) and the Omicron variant ( 3 . 19 days , 95 % CI : 2 . 95 - 3 . 43 days ) ( Figure 3 , Figure S2 ) . A 23 significantly shorter serial interval was found for each VOC compared to the ancestral lineage ( p - values : 24 0 . 032 , < 0 . 001 , < 0 . 001 for Alpha , Delta , and Omicron , respectively ) . Likewise , the central tendency of the 25 serial interval subsequently decreased by 27 . 7 % from the ancestral lineage to Alpha ( p - value : 0 . 032 ) , 11 . 1 % 26 from the Delta to Omicron ( p - value : 0 . 024 ) . And the differences between Alpha and Delta ( p - value : 0 . 602 ) 27 All rights reserved . No reuse allowed without permission .

Our results suggested no potential publication bias in the included studies ( p - value : 1 0 . 764 ) ( Figure S6 in the Supplement ) . 2 3 Generation time 4 For the realized generation time , the ancestral lineage had the largest pooled mean generation time ( 4 . 94 5 days , 95 % CI : 4 . 29 - 5 . 58 days ) , followed by the Alpha variant ( 4 . 36 days , 95 % CI : 3 . 91 - 4 . 80 days ) , the 6 Delta variant ( 3 . 65 days , 95 % CI : 3 . 25 - 4 . 05 days ) , and the Omicron variant ( 2 . 96 days , 95 % CI : 2 . 54 - 3 . 38 7 days ) ( Figure 4 , Figure S3 ) . The realized generation times for the Delta and Omicron variants were 8 significantly shorter than the ancestral lineage ( p - values : 0 . 005 , < 0 . 001 for Delta and Omicron , 9 respectively ) . The central tendency of the generation time subsequently decreased by 16 . 3 % from Alpha to 10 Delta ( p - value : 0 . 028 ) , 18 . 9 % from Delta to Omicron ( p - value : 0 . 043 ) , and there was no significant 11 difference between ancestral lineage and Alpha ( p - value : 0 . 193 ) . Our results suggested no potential 12 publication bias in the included studies ( p - value : 0 . 709 ) ( Figure S7 in the Supplement ) . 13 14 For the intrinsic generation time , we obtained a pooled mean estimate of 5 . 86 days ( 95 % CI : 5 . 47 - 6 . 26 days ) 15 for the Alpha variant based on two studies and 5 . 67 days ( 95 % CI : 3 . 79 - 7 . 55 days ) for the Delta variant 16 based on two studies ( Figure 5 , Figure S4 ) . Only one study ( for Italy ) reported an estimate for the Omicron 17 variant : 6 . 84 days ( 95 % CrI : 5 . 72 - 8 . 60 days ) . 18 19 Discussion 20 Our study revealed that Omicron had the shortest pooled estimates for the incubation period ( 3 . 63 days , 21 95 % CI : 3 . 25 - 4 . 02 days ) , serial interval ( 3 . 19 days , 95 % CI : 2 . 95 - 3 . 43 days ) , and realized generation time 22 ( 2 . 96 days , 95 % CI : 2 . 54 - 3 . 38 days ) compared to previous variants . Our results were comparable to those 23 of Galmiche , S . , et al . , who reported SARS - CoV - 2 incubation period was notably reduced in omicron cases 24 compared with all other variants of concern [ 173 ] . The ancestral lineage had the highest pooled estimates 25 for each of the three indicators , followed by Alpha and Delta . These finding suggest that the incubation 26 period , serial interval , and realized generation times of COVID - 19 became shorter over the course of the 27 All rights reserved .

Furthermore , China provided more records of estimates for incubation 8 period ( 60 . 6 % ) , serial interval ( 34 . 6 % ) , and generation time ( 37 . 5 % ) than any other country . This may be 9 due to the smaller outbreak size of COVID - 19 outbreaks in China before the rise of Omicron as compared 10 to countries with widespread COVID - 19 transmission , which made contact tracing and household studies 11 easier to be conducted . This further support the importance of contact tracing not only as a tool for 12 monitoring and controlling infectious disease spread , but also for understanding transmission patterns . 13 14 Examining the intrinsic generation time is done using recently developed Bayesian methods , which may 15 explain why only two studies have provided estimates for this indicator [ 17 , 32 ] . Between these studies , 16 there were only 5 records : 2 for Alpha , 2 the Delta , and 1 for Omicron . Given the small sample size , a 17 pooled mean estimate was not warranted , and we could not compare possible differences between 18 subsequent VOCs . 19 The incubation period of the ancestral lineage , and the Alpha , Beta , and Delta variants , is generally longer 20 than that of other acute respiratory viral infections , such as human coronavirus ( 3 . 2 days ) , influenza A 21 ( 1 . 43 - 1 . 64 days ) , parainfluenza ( 2 . 6 days ) , respiratory syncytial virus ( 4 . 4 days ) , and rhinovirus ( 1 . 4 days ) 22 [ 174 ] . Our findings produced similar mean incubation period estimates to those reported by Du , Z . , et al . , 23 for Delta ( 4 . 8 days 95 % CI : 3 . 9 - 5 . 6 ) and Omicron ( 3 . 6 days , 95 % CI : 2 . 3 - 4 . 9 ) [ 175 ] and those reported by 24 Wu et . al . , for Alpha ( 5 . 00 days , 95 % CI : 4 . 94 - 5 . 06 days ) , Delta ( 4 . 41 days , 95 % CI : 3 . 76 - 5 . 05 days ) , and 25 Omicron ( 3 . 42 days , 95 % CI : 2 . 88 - 3 . 96 days ) [ 23 ] . 26 27 All rights reserved .

These estimates are 1 longer than those of influenza A ( H3N2 ) ( 2 . 2 days ) and pandemic influenza A ( H1N1 ) pdm09 ( 2 . 8 days ) , but 2 shorter than those of the respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV , 7 . 5 days ) , measles ( 11 . 7 days ) , varicella ( 14 . 0 3 days ) , smallpox ( 17 . 7 days ) , mumps ( 18 . 0 days ) , rubella ( 18 . 3 days ) , pertussis ( 22 . 8 days ) , and Middle 4 East respiratory syndrome ( MERS , 7 . 6 days ) [ 176 ] [ 177 ] . Our results were comparable to those of Du , Z . , 5 et al . , who reported an average serial interval of 3 . 4 days ( 95 % CI , 3 . 0 - 3 . 7 ) for the Delta variant and 3 . 1 6 days ( 95 % CI , 2 . 9 - 3 . 2 ) for the Omicron variant , respectively [ 175 ] . 7 8 The mean generation time of COVID - 19 ranged from 2 . 36 to 6 . 84 days , longer than those of influenza A 9 ( H1N1 ) ( 2 days ) and pandemic influenza A ( H1N1 ) pdm09 ( 2 . 92 days ) [ 178 ] , but shorter than those of the 10 MERS ( 10 . 7 days ) [ 179 , 180 ] . 11 12 Overall , the serial interval maintained a shorter pooled mean estimate compared to the incubation period 13 across different virus lineages , indicating that a large proportion of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission occurs prior 14 to symptom onset [ 181 - 183 ] . Pre - symptomatic transmission was a critical factor facilitating SARS - CoV - 2 15 spread [ 184 ] , highlighting the importance of obtaining timely estimates of these indicators and keep 16 monitoring their possible changes over the course of an epidemic . 17 18 The current study provides scientific evidence that the incubation period of COVID - 19 has shortened as 19 the virus has evolved , which has important implications for the formulation of effective epidemic control 20 strategies such as isolation and quarantine . It is still unclear whether the increase of immunity levels in the 21 population has contributed to this trend , as prior infection or vaccination can affect the incubation period 22 by altering the viral load and shedding [ 185 ] . Similarly , it is unclear whether the diverse immunological 23 landscape in different countries has contributed to the substantial heterogeneity of the incubation period 24 observed for the same variant across different studies . 25 26 Our findings also demonstrated that the serial intervals of COVID - 19 shortened with each new VOC . 27 All rights reserved .

The highly heterogeneous implementation of NPIs between 4 countries , within country , and time frame has probably contributed to heterogeneous estimates of the serial 5 interval that we observed between studies . This applies also for estimates of the realized generation time . 6 We acknowledge some limitations in this study . First , results of the included studies revealed considerable 7 heterogeneities ( I 2 > 80 % ) when pooling the estimates across different virus lineages , indicating potential 8 unmeasured confounding from population factors ( e . g . , social behavior ) . Specifically , heterogeneities for 9 the incubation period may be due to heterogeneities in the age structure and presence of pre - existing 10 conditions in the host population [ 187 , 188 ] , whereas diversity in contact settings and the strength of NPIs 11 may be responsible for heterogeneity of the estimates for the serial interval and realized generation time . 12 However , these data were rarely available from the included published literature and preprints , thus 13 preventing further exploration in our study . As per the inclusion criteria , we only used data collected from 14 studies published in English potentially subjecting our study to reporting bias , which may impact our 15 results . This study may be limited by recall bias as many studies included in the analysis rely on 16 retrospective data collection for exposure and symptom onset , which would influence the obtained 17 estimates . The incubation period for the Beta variant and the intrinsic generation time for Omicron were 18 each included in only one study , and thus it was not possible to produce pooled estimates . 19 20 In conclusion , our findings suggest that the incubation period , serial interval , and generation time of 21 SARS - CoV - 2 have evolved to shorter intervals with the emergence of each new VOC . Identifying the 22 length of each of these indicators is critical for understanding the epidemiology of different SARS - CoV - 2 23 variants and developing control measures for mitigating the spread of COVID - 19 . Moreover , 24 understanding trends in these indicators can be instrumental for preparedness planning for future COVID - 25 19 outbreaks . 26 27 All rights reserved .
