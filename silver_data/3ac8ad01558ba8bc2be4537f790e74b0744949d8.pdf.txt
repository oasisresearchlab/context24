We aimed to examine the key risk factors to better 12 understand transmission in school settings . 13 14 Methods 15 We collected records of SARS - CoV - 2 school outbreaks globally published from January 2020 to 16 January 2021 and compiled information on hypothesized risk factors . We utilized the directed 17 acyclic graph ( DAG ) to conceptualize the risk mechanisms , used logistic regression to examine 18 each risk - factor group , and further built multiple variable models based on the marginal 19 analysis . Adjusted odds ratios ( aOR ) and 95 % confidence intervals ( CI ) were calculated . 20 21 Results 22 From 17 relevant articles , 26 school clusters were included for analysis . The best - fit model 23 showed that the intensity of community transmission ( aOR : 1 . 26 ; 95 % CI : 1 . 22 - 1 . 30 , for each 24 increase of 10 cases per 100 , 000 persons per week ) , social distancing ( aOR : 0 . 26 ; 95 % CI : 0 . 18 - 25 0 . 37 ) , mask - wearing ( aOR : 0 . 52 ; 95 % CI : 0 . 35 - 0 . 78 ) were associated the risk of SARS - CoV - 2 26 infection in schools . Compared to students in pre - schools , the aOR was 0 . 12 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 07 - 27 0 . 19 ) for students in primary schools and 1 . 31 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 93 - 1 . 87 ) for students in high schools . 28 29 Conclusions 30 Preventive measures in both schools ( e . g . social distancing and mask - wearing ) and communities 31 ( additionally , vaccination ) should be taken to collectively reduce transmission and protect 32 children in schools . Flexible reopening policies may be considered for different levels of schools 33 given their risk differences . 34 35 Keywords 36 COVID - 19 , transmission , children , school , secondary attack rate 37 38 All rights reserved .

Out of an abundance 52 of caution and fear that the SARS - CoV - 2 virus would spread rapidly in schools much like 53 influenza pandemics [ 2 ] , countries globally decided to suspend in - person classes and begin 54 online instruction . By April 2020 , over 1 . 5 million students worldwide were affected by school 55 closures in response to the COVID - 19 pandemic [ 3 ] . In contrast to influenza pandemics where 56 children are the key drivers of transmission , studies have indicated that children are likely less 57 susceptible to SARS - CoV - 2 infection , tend to experience less severe disease when infected , and 58 likely have lower transmissibility [ 4 , 5 ] . Given this new evidence , schools in many places have 59 gradually reopened since the summer of 2020 , while implementing varying level of preventive 60 measures ( e . g . , mask wearing , distancing , limiting the number of students , rotating schedules , 61 and viral testing ) to reduce risk of transmission . Given these circumstances , the risk of SARS - 62 CoV - 2 outbreaks in school settings may differ substantially across space and time . Indeed , 63 several studies have examined school outbreaks of COVID - 19 and reported secondary attack 64 rates ( SAR ) – i . e . , the proportion of infected contacts of an index case out of all contacts of that 65 index case [ 6 ] – ranging from 0 ( i . e . , no secondary infections ) to 100 % ( i . e . , infections among all 66 contacts ) . However , this discrepancy is still not fully understood and a better understanding 67 can inform better preventive measures for future outbreaks not limited to COVID - 19 or school 68 settings . 69 70 To identify the main factors that determine the transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 in schools and 71 inform strategies to prevent future school outbreaks , here we examined the associations 72 between SARS - CoV - 2 SAR in children and various potential risk factors . We compiled data from 73 relevant studies in the literature reporting SARS - CoV - 2 SAR in schools and for posited risk 74 factors ( e . g . incidence in the community ) and further used regression models to examine key 75 All rights reserved .

We found that appropriate distancing and mask 76 wearing , school levels , and the magnitude of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in the community are 77 key determinants of SAR in school settings . 78 79 Methods 80 Data sources 81 Studies were searched for on the “Living Evidence for COVID - 19” database [ 24 ] , which retrieves 82 articles from EMBASE via Ovid , PubMed , BioRxiv , and MedRxiv . Any article within this database 83 was considered , from December 2019 up to February 17 , 2021 . The search terms used include 84 “transmission AND ( school OR schools ) ” or “transmission AND children . ” When titles and 85 abstracts were identified as being potentially relevant , the articles were read to determine if 86 the outbreaks took place in a school setting and the number of infections and contacts were 87 reported . In addition , we extracted 11 observations included in a systematic review of evidence 88 regarding the ability of children to transmit SARS - CoV - 2 in schools [ 7 ] . In total , 17 studies were 89 included in this analysis ( see Appendix 1 ) . 90 91 Relevant data , as deemed by an initial conceptual analysis using the directed acyclic graph 92 ( DAG ; see details below ) , were taken from the articles identified above . These included the 93 time period of the study , study design , location , season , age of children , whether the study 94 happened during a lockdown , type of school according to the International Standard 95 Classification of Education [ 8 ] , reported SARs , number of contacts of the index case , testing 96 method ( PCR vs . serology ) , level of surveillance ( all contacts , some contacts , only symptomatic ) , 97 and whether masks and social distancing were required . In addition , we compiled additional 98 data for potential risk or confounding factors of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in schools for each 99 identified study as detailed in the next section . 100 101 Conceptual analysis and variable coding 102 The unit of analysis was individual study and in cases where several school types were covered 103 in one study the data were stratified by those school types . We first conducted a conceptual 104 analysis using the DAG and identified eight key components that may affect SARS - CoV - 2 105 transmission in schools ( Fig 1 ) . Below we describe each of the eight components , rationale for 106 inclusion , and related variables examined . 107 108 1 ) School types , based on studies indicating differential transmission risk among different age 109 groups [ 20 , 22 ] . Here , we examined this factor as a categorical variable including 4 levels , i . e . 110 pre - school or early childhood education center ( ECEC ) , primary school , high school , and mixed - 111 level school . The first three levels were per reports in the included school studies . For studies 112 that examined several types of school but did not report school type specific SARs , we assigned 113 All rights reserved . No reuse allowed without permission .

For example , if a study gave the overall SAR combining 114 a pre - school and a primary school it was given the value “mixed - level school . ” 115 SARS - CoV - 2 SAR among children in school settings is the number of infected contacts divided by 116 the total number of contacts at each school . 117 118 2 ) Physical school settings such as student density in the classroom and ventilation systems that 119 may affect the intensity of school contact and clearance of air . As it is difficult to obtain 120 information related to ventilation settings , here we included class size in our analysis based on 121 the average number of students per classroom in each country , as reported by the Organisation 122 for Economic Co - operation and Development ( OECD ) [ 12 ] . 123 124 3 ) Cultural climates , which “represent independent preferences for one state of affairs over 125 another that distinguish countries ( rather than individuals ) from each other” [ 9 ] and may reflect 126 the collective risk tendency of a population . The Hofstede’s cultural dimensions theory [ 9 ] 127 included 6 related measures including individualism , masculinity , uncertainty avoidance , long 128 term orientation , and indulgence . In particular , individualism is defined as the degree of 129 interdependence of society maintains among its members . We reasoned that the individualism 130 measure would be most relevant to the level of compliancy to public health interventions and 131 in turn the risk of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission . Thus , here we included individualism in our analysis 132 and dichotomized the reported values for each country into high ( ≥ 50 ) or low . 133 134 4 ) Preventive measures , which may reduce outbreak risk . Here we included both mask - wearing 135 and social distancing . For these variables , we dichotomized based on as the use of face masks 136 ( or social distancing ) by either students , staff , or both . For instance , for mask - wearing , if either 137 group ( students or staff ) were required to wear face masks onsite , the school would receive a 138 value of 1 and 0 otherwise . 139 140 5 ) Surveillance and / or testing policies implemented in schools . On the one hand , testing policies 141 could affect the reported values of SAR ; for instance , testing of all contacts regardless of 142 symptoms may lead to identification of more infections including those asymptomatic and 143 increase the numerator of SAR . On the other , frequent testing of all if combined with school 144 closure may serve as a containment measure to reduce the risk of onward transmission and in 145 turn reduce SAR . Here we thus included the reported testing practices for contacts in the 146 school outbreak clusters as a categorical ordinal variable . Three types of testing were reported 147 in the school studies , including testing only the symptomatic , both symptomatic and some 148 asymptomatic , and all contacts . However , due to the small sample size in “only symptomatic” 149 ( n = 3 ) , we dichotomized surveillance to testing “only symptomatic or some asymptomatic” and 150 “all contacts” of an index case in each school cluster . 151 All rights reserved .

To examine its impact , we included two measures , i . e . , the weekly case rate per 154 100 , 000 for the study area for the study period and weekly death rate per 100 , 000 from COVID - 155 19 ; both measures were computed using data from the John Hopkins Coronavirus Resource 156 Center [ 10 ] and standardized by overall country population . See “Sensitivity analysis” below for 157 justification of these choices . 158 159 7 ) Seasonal changes such as humidity and temperature , which may affect the survival and 160 transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 . Here , we used specific humidity ( a measure of absolute humidity ) 161 to examine the potential impact from disease seasonality , as specific humidity and temperature 162 are highly correlated . Specifically , ground surface temperature and relative humidity for each 163 study location were extracted from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration using 164 the “stationaRy” package [ 11 ] . Daily mean specific humidity in g H 2 0 / kg air was then computed 165 based on the temperature and relative humidity data and was averaged over the study period . 166 167 8 ) Indicators of socioeconomic status such as national income that reflect a country’s ability to 168 mobilize resources to fight COVID - 19 . As such , we included measured national income for each 169 study in our analysis ; specifically , national income is measured as the gross domestic product 170 ( GDP ) subtracting capital depreciation and adding net foreign income , using data from the 171 World Inequality Database [ 13 ] . 172 173 Statistical Analyses 174 Marginal analysis . 175 Due to the low number of observations ( n = 26 schools ) , we conducted an initial analysis to test 176 combinations of the DAG covariates described above . The goal was to examine the relationship 177 between SAR and only one group of variables at a time and then include the most relevant 178 predictors into the final model based on this analysis . For each test , we used a logistic 179 regression model of the following form : 180 l 𝑜𝑔𝑖𝑡 ( 𝑆𝐴𝑅 ) ∼ 𝑋 181 where logit is the log - odds ( i . e . , 𝑙𝑜𝑔 + , - . , / , with p as the probability of event ) and SAR 182 represents the SAR as reported from each of the 26 schools . X is one of the combinations of 183 variables we examined as follows : 184 1 ) Preventive measures ( mask - wearing and social distancing ) adjusting for seasonal changes 185 2 ) Community transmission ( weekly death rate per 100 , 000 and weekly case rate per 100 , 000 ) 186 3 ) Seasonal changes 187 4 ) Classroom size , adjusting for national income 188 5 ) School type 189 All rights reserved .

We thus tested models including different combinations of these variables . For all 193 models , we included surveillance type to account for potential biases in reporting including 194 missing asymptomatic infections , which would underestimate SAR . We also assessed for 195 confounding between our variables of interest and SARS - CoV - 2 SAR ( see adjustments specified 196 above ) . This procedure began with including all of the significant variables from the marginal 197 analysis and removing one at a time to see the effect of its removal on model fit . We then 198 evaluated and selected the most parsimonious model with the best fit based on the Akaike 199 information criterion ( AIC ; Table S1 ) . The best performing model took the following form : 200 201 l 𝑜𝑔𝑖𝑡 ( 𝑆𝐴𝑅 ) ∼ mask - wearing + social distancing + weekly case rate + school type + surveillance 202 203 All statistical analyses were performed in RStudio , a user interface for R ( R Foundation for 204 Statistical Computing , Vienna , Austria ) . All models were fitted using the “glm” function from the 205 built - in “stats” library in R . 206 207 Sensitivity analysis 208 We tested different measures of community transmission , to examine the robustness of our 209 models to potential biases due to variations in case - ascertainment , mortality risk , and delay in 210 event occurrence ( e . g . from infection to death ) and reporting . Specifically , we additionally 211 examined two mortality - related measures in representing the intensity of community 212 transmission : 1 ) weekly death rate for the study period and 2 ) weekly death rate for the study 213 period plus one month . The additional month added accounts for the time lag that occurs as 214 death from COVID - 19 may take several weeks [ 14 ] . Risk factors identified using these two 215 measures were similar to those in our main analysis ( Table S2 ) . As the risk of death due to 216 COVID - 19 reduced substantially over time [ 15 ] , likely due to improved medical treatment and 217 management , such a change may bias the death rates recorded over time for the included 218 studies spanning the initial phase in March 2020 to a later phase in Dec 2020 . For this reason , 219 we used weekly case rate per 100 , 000 to represent the intensity of community transmission in 220 our main analysis . 221 222 Results 223 Summary statistics 224 We identified 26 reported SARS - CoV - 2 outbreaks in schools , totaling 630 secondary cases in 225 children among 8322 contacts . These outbreaks occurred in 12 countries , spanning 4 WHO 226 regions including the Americas , Western Pacific , European , and Eastern Mediterranean Region . 227 All rights reserved .

SARS - CoV - 2 SAR and weekly cases per 100 , 000 population were both right skewed . 229 While the reported SAR ranged from 0 to 100 % , the majority of schools reported very low SAR 230 ( median : 0 . 7 % , interquartile range : 0 – 17 % ) . The majority of school settings included in these 231 studies required mask - wearing ( 19 / 26 , or 73 % ) and distancing ( 14 / 26 , or 54 % ) . Around half of 232 the studies tested all contacts of the index case ( 12 / 26 , or 46 % ) . The studies covered roughly 233 even proportion for different school types : 5 ( 19 % ) were pre - schools , 9 ( 35 % ) were primary 234 schools , 7 ( 27 % ) were high schools , and 5 ( 19 % ) were mixed schools . 235 236 Marginal analysis 237 The marginal analysis ( Figure 2 ) , adjusting for surveillance , indicated that , for the intensity of 238 community transmission , each 10 - unit increase in weekly case rate was associated with an 239 increased risk of contracting SARS - CoV - 2 in schools [ odds ratio ( OR ) : 1 . 11 ; 95 % confidence 240 interval ( CI ) : 1 . 08 - 1 . 14 ] ; and each 10 - unit increase in weekly death rate was associated with an 241 increased risk of contracting SARS - CoV - 2 in schools ( OR : 1 . 47 ; 95 % CI : 1 . 40 - 1 . 54 ) . For 242 preventive measures , social distancing ( OR : 0 . 21 , 95 % CI : 0 . 16 - 0 . 29 ) was associated with a 243 lower SAR in schools . For school type , compared to pre - schools , being in primary schools ( OR : 244 0 . 69 , 95 % CI : 0 . 49 - 0 . 98 ) or mixed schools ( OR : 0 . 69 ; 95 % CI : 0 . 49 - 0 . 98 ) was associated with a 245 lower risk of SARS - CoV - 2 infection whereas being in high schools ( OR : 1 . 96 ; 95 % CI : 1 . 44 - 2 . 69 ) 246 was associated with a higher risk of SARS - CoV - 2 infection . For the school physical setting 247 measure , each 1 - person increase in the national average class size was associated with an 248 increased risk of contracting SARS - CoV - 2 in schools ( OR : 1 . 26 ; 95 % CI : 1 . 21 - 1 . 30 ) . For disease 249 seasonality , each 1 g H 2 0 / kg increase in specific humidity was associated with a decreased risk 250 of contracting SARS - CoV - 2 in schools ( OR : 0 . 88 , 95 % CI : 0 . 85 , 0 . 92 ) . Estimates were similar 251 when the model did not adjust for surveillance ( Figure 2 ) . 252 253 Multi - risk factor analysis 254 Among all models tested ( Table S1 ) , the best - performing model with the lowest AIC included 255 three key groups of risk factors , namely , intensity of community transmission , preventive 256 measures , and school type , adjusting for surveillance . Overall , these risk factors in combination 257 were able to explain 57 . 7 % of the variance in the reported SARS - CoV - 2 SAR ( McFadden’s 258 pseudo R 2 = 0 . 577 ; Fig 3 ) [ 21 , 23 ] . Fig 4 and Table 2 show the estimated adjusted ORs ( aORs ) 259 for each risk factor . 260 261 The multi - risk factor model showed that every 10 - unit increase in COVID - 19 cases rate in the 262 community was associated with an increased risk of SARS - CoV - 2 infection in schools ( aOR : 1 . 26 ; 263 95 % CI : 1 . 22 - 1 . 30 ) . Conversely , both social distancing ( aOR : 0 . 26 ; 95 % CI : 0 . 18 - 0 . 37 ) and 264 All rights reserved . No reuse allowed without permission .

Compared to students in pre - schools , the aOR was 0 . 12 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 07 , 0 . 19 ) 266 for students in primary schools , 1 . 31 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 93 , 1 . 87 ) for students in high schools , and 0 . 26 267 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 18 , 0 . 39 ) for students in mixed schools . 268 269 Discussion 270 Leveraging available data on multiple reported SARS - CoV - 2 outbreaks in schools and potential 271 risk factors , we have examined main factors associated with the risk of SARS - CoV - 2 272 transmission in schools . Our analyses suggest that the most significant predictors of SARS - CoV - 273 2 SAR in schools are the level of community transmission ( measured as weekly COVID - 19 case 274 rate ) and preventative measures , once adjusted for surveillance and school type . 275 276 The model identified community transmission as the most significant variable associated with 277 the risk of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in schools . In particular , the multi - risk factor model 278 estimated that , in a community of 100 , 000 persons , every 10 additional cases per week in the 279 community increases the odds of infection in schools by 26 % . This finding highlights the 280 potential community - to - school importation of cases and subsequent risk of outbreak in schools . 281 As such , care must be applied when reopening or operating schools in areas with high levels of 282 community transmission . In addition , reversing some original fears about school - to - community 283 SARS - CoV - 2 transmission , it is likely that the community transmission drives outbreaks in 284 school , not the reverse . Further , with the availability of COVID - 19 vaccines , predominantly to 285 adults at present , it is paramount that all eligible adults get vaccinated promptly to lower the 286 risk of transmission in the community and in turn to provide indirect protection to children via 287 the increased population immunity . 288 289 Our model suggests that distancing policies have the greatest impact on reducing transmission 290 in schools ( aOR : 0 . 26 , 95 % CI : 0 . 18 - 0 . 37 ) . This finding is likely a combined outcome of reduced 291 number of contacts and reduced short - range transmission when social distancing policies were 292 followed . Maintaining distance has necessitated fewer people in a room at the same time , 293 leading to fewer contacts . In addition , the increased personal space in classroom enables 294 students to avoid the likely higher viral concentration within short - range of the emitter ( either 295 via aerosols , droplets , or in combination ) when far apart . 296 297 Nevertheless , it is important to note that social distancing measures may be more diﬀicult to 298 achieve fully in disadvantaged communities with underfunded and overcrowded schools , 299 further exacerbating the COVID - 19 crises in these communities , usually of color [ 16 , 17 ] . 300 Furthermore , racially motivated structural factors prevent these disadvantaged communities 301 from practicing social distancing policies outside of the school . For example , these communities 302 All rights reserved . No reuse allowed without permission .

While the association was not as substantial as for 307 social distancing , a reduction by half ( aOR : 0 . 52 ; 95 % CI : 0 . 35 - 0 . 78 ) is still considerable . In 308 addition to mitigating the risk of infection , this protective association may also come from 309 masks reducing the emission of viral particles of SARS - CoV - 2 infected wearers [ 18 ] . This latter 310 means of protection is particularly important in settings like schools , as infections in children 311 are more likely to be asymptomatic or mild and thus more difficult to identify [ 23 ] . 312 Nevertheless , concerns have been raised regarding the potential developmental and health 313 harms of masks on very young children . Given this trade - off , more effective use of other 314 preventive measures such as vaccination of all those eligible especially care takers , improved 315 ventilation , and physical distancing may serve to reduce the need for long - term use of masks 316 among very young children for their protection . 317 318 In comparison to pre - schools , students in both primary and mixed - level schools had a lower risk 319 of SARS - CoV - 2 infection whereas those in high schools had a higher risk . This finding is 320 consistent with previous studies indicating the likely lower susceptibility to SARS - CoV - 2 321 infection and transmissibility among young children [ 23 ] . In addition , it is also likely in part due 322 to the greater ability of older children to follow directions regarding preventive measures but 323 with less compliance among high school students . The similarity of the estimates between 324 primary school and mixed - level schools is likely due to the number of primary schools that were 325 folded into the mixed - level school category – three of the five schools that made up this group 326 included primary schools . Overall , these findings support flexible reopening policies for 327 different levels of schools given the risk differences . 328 329 When schools test all contacts of the index case , this effectively functions as a control measure 330 in that more cases will be detected and is more likely to result in a school closure . This may 331 explain why the OR estimate for all contacts surveillance is protective , as the outbreak was 332 identified and able to be contained before the asymptomatic individuals were able to infect 333 others . 334 335 This study has several limitations . First , the analyses included a limited number of studies ( n = 336 26 ) , due to the inclusion criteria and the dearth of published reports on this topic to date . 337 Future research with additional relevant studies may enhance the statistical power of inference 338 for the risk factors examined here .

Similarly , 342 due to the lack of data , we were not able to examine other key factors such as ventilation in 343 classrooms , social economic status of individual students and their households , and potential 344 differences in susceptibility and transmissibility by age group . Future work with comprehensive 345 study designs and data collection is warranted to provide further insights into how infections , 346 not limited to SARS - CoV - 2 , spread in schools and the broad , bi - directional impact of school and 347 community transmission .

Performance of different models . In the marginal analysis , 5 models for 5 groups of 589 risk factors are tested . In the multi - risk factor analysis , 11 models with all possible combinations 590 of 4 groups of risk factors are tested ( i . e . , excluding models with only one group tested in the 591 marginal analysis ) . All models adjusted for surveillance . Note that although class size was 592 identified as a significant risk factor in the marginal analysis , further including this variable in 593 the multi - risk models gave impossible values for parameter estimates ; we therefore excluded 594 class size in the multi - risk model analysis . The best - performing model with the lowest AIC is 595 bolded . 596 Analysis Model AIC Marginal analysis Mask wearing , distancing , seasonal changes , and surveillance 1106 . 60 Weekly cases , weekly deaths , surveillance 890 . 34 Specific humidity and surveillance 1278 . 58 Class size , national income , and surveillance 1028 . 87 School type and surveillance 1177 . 23 Multi - risk factor analysis ( all adjusted for surveillance ) Mask wearing , distancing , and specific humidity 1106 . 59 School type , and specific humidity 1035 . 03 Mask wearing , distancing , and weekly cases 950 . 51 Mask wearing , distancing , and school type 795 . 92 Specific humidity and weekly cases 1106 . 99 School type and weekly cases 893 . 05 Mask wearing , distancing , specific humidity , and school type 794 . 60 Mask wearing , distancing , specific humidity , and weekly cases 951 . 39 Specific humidity , school type , and weekly cases 794 . 85 Mask wearing , distancing , weekly cases , school type , and specific humidity 598 . 01 Mask wearing , distancing , weekly cases , and school type 596 . 33 597 All rights reserved .
