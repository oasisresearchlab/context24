However , neuroethologi - cal studies in songbirds have been limited by the lack of high - throughput molecular resources and gene - manipulation tools . To overcome these limitations , we constructed 21 regular , normal - ized , and subtracted full - length cDNA libraries from brains of zebra ﬁnches in 57 developmental and behavioral conditions in an attempt to clone as much of the brain transcriptome as possible . From these libraries , (cid:1) 14 , 000 transcripts were isolated , represent - ing an estimated 4 , 738 genes . With the cDNAs , we created a hierarchically organized transcriptome database and a large - scale songbird brain cDNA microarray . We used the arrays to reveal a set of 33 genes that are regulated in forebrain vocal nuclei by singing behavior . These genes clustered into four anatomical and six temporal expression patterns . Their functions spanned a large range of cellular and molecular categories , from signal transduc - tion , trafﬁcking , and structural , to synaptically released molecules . With the full - length cDNAs and a lentiviral vector system , we were able to overexpress , in vocal nuclei , proteins of representative singing - regulated genes in the absence of singing . This publicly accessible resource http : (cid:2)(cid:2) songbirdtranscriptome . net can now be used to study molecular neuroethological mechanisms of behavior . O scine songbirds learn their songs by imitating those of adults . Their song behavior is readily quantified and is controlled by a system of discreet brain vocal nuclei ( Fig . 8 , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site ) ( 1 , 2 ) . For these reasons , birdsong has been an ideal model for investigating caus - ative , developmental , functional , and evolutionary aspects of a complex , learned behavior , the four fundamentals of ethology ( 3 ) . These fundamentals are difficult to study at a molecular level in songbirds because of the lack of high - throughput molecular and gene - manipulation tools for studying songbirds . Song production is associated with a rapid immediate early gene - expression response in vocal nuclei ( 4 ) , where only three genes ( egr - 1 or ZENK , c - fos , and BDNF ) up - regulated by singing had been identified when we began this project ( 4 – 6 ) ; two others ( UCHL1 and Arc ) were recently reported ( 7 , 8 ) . Of these , full - length songbird cDNA clones are available only for UCHL1 . Full - length cDNAs contain the protein coding sequence ( cds ) and 5 (cid:2) and 3 (cid:2) UTRs of a gene , and the cds is necessary to generate functional proteins for overexpres - sion experiments . Such experiments help determine a gene’s mo - lecular function and its role in a behavioral process . In addition , full - length cDNAs allow for cross - species hybridization ( Fig . 9 , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site ) , and identification of conserved sequences among species . To overcome these limitations , we produced a high - throughput mo - lecular resource that was focused , from start to finish , on cloning full - length cDNAs expressed in the brain from a variety of devel - opmental and behavioral conditions . The resource includes an annotated database , cDNA microarrays , and a gene - manipulation approach . We used this resource to identify a dynamic cascade of genes up - and down - regulated in brain vocal nuclei by singing behavior . The genes include some activity - dependent transcription factors and many late - response housekeeping molecules . Their functions and differential patterns suggest that large gene regula - tory networks for basic brain processes are recruited as a result of behavioral performance . Figs . 10 – 21 , Tables 1 – 6 , and Appendix , which are published as supporting information on the PNAS web site , all cited below , show additional information . Results Brain Transcriptome Libraries . We used brains of 60 zebra finches in 57 different developmental , pathological , and behavioral states ( Table 1 ) to create 21 cDNA libraries : 6 normalized , 4 abundant , 5 subtracted , and 6 regular ( Table 2 ; definitions are in Glossary in Appendix ) . The 6 normalized libraries were made from a silent male , undirected singing males , directed singing males , embryonic males and females , 50 juvenile and adult animals in different behavioralstates , andanimalsundergoingrapidvocallearning ( Fig . 10 and Table 2 ) . Subtracted libraries were focused on enriching for genes related to vocal learning and singing . For each library , the first - strand reactions were made with primers that contain unique 3 (cid:2) sequence IDs for each animal ( Table 1 ) . In all , we estimate that our libraries contain (cid:1) 4 . 21 million independent cDNA clones ( basedonthenumberof Escherichiacoli transformants ) .

Of these , 13 , 694 ( 76 % ) had successful reactions of overall high base call quality ( average phred probability score (cid:1) 20 ; Table 3 ) . After removing bacterial , mammalian , and chimera contaminants ( Appendix section 3 . 6 . 1 ) , of the remaining 13 , 665 cDNAs , 42 % were from normalized and 58 % from subtracted libraries . Representation of Full - Length Protein Coding Sequences . Clones ranged in size from 0 . 5 to (cid:3) 6 kb ( Fig . 11 ) . To assess the proportion that are potentially full length , we used a secondary measure , putative translated protein cds . We could not analyze the proportion of 5 (cid:2) and 3 (cid:2) UTRs that are full length , because this analysis requires making cap analysis of gene expression libraries and having genomic sequences . We analyzed cds with 70 – 100 % identity to known full - length cds of other species , a conservative selection criterion . Of the 13 , 665 cDNAs , 11 , 633 met this criterion and of these , 10 , 986 ( 94 % ) had a cds with an initiation methionine and upstream 5 (cid:2) UTR ( and downstream 3 (cid:2) UTR when the 3 (cid:2) UTR sequence reaction was available ) . Thus , the randomly picked clones from the libraries contained a majority of cDNAs with full - length cds . Brain Transcriptome Database and Representation . With the se - quenced cDNAs , we created a hierarchically organized transcrip - tome database http : (cid:2)(cid:2) songbirdtranscriptome . net ( Fig . 12 ) from sequence reads , individual cDNAs , and subclusters of nearly iden - tical cDNAs to clusters of variant cDNAs . Machine - automated , followed by human - curated annotations organized the 13 , 665 cD - NAs into 6 , 147 subclusters representing relatively unique tran - scripts . The 6 , 147 subclusters were further grouped into 4 , 738 clusters ( containing transcript variants when present ) , presumably representing unique genes . We estimate that these clusters may represent (cid:1) 20 % ofthegenes ( proteincodingandnoncoding ) ofthe avian genome , based on the calculation that the chicken genome contains (cid:1) 23 , 517 genes ( 23 , 000 protein coding and 517 noncoding ) ( 9 ) . These clusters may further represent (cid:1) 40 % of the genes expressed in the brain , based on the calculation that (cid:1) 50 % of the genes in the genome are predicted to be expressed in the songbird brain ( 10 ) . Of the 4 , 738 clusters , (cid:1) 80 % and (cid:1) 60 % are similar at (cid:3) 70 % identitytochickenandhumancDNAs , respectively ( Fig . 13 ) . Ontology analysis revealed a molecular representation of gene families similar to humans ( Fig . 1 A ) , with protein binding and catalytic activity as the most abundant . Variant subclusters within clusters consisted of a higher - than - expected apparent alternative splicing within the 5 (cid:2) ends ( Fig . 1 B ) , some of which affected cds ( data not shown ) . Most variations ( (cid:1) 60 % ) were at the cDNA ends , including alternative polyadenylation . Antisense RNA was the smallest group of variants . Most cDNAs had a high GC content , average 71 % , in the first 100 bp of the 5 (cid:2) end relative to an average of 50 . 5 % across the cDNAs ( P (cid:4) 0 . 0001 , paired t test , two - tailed ; calculated for only fully sequenced clones ) . Thus , songbird mRNAs may have an important feature described for mammalian mRNAs : high GC content in the 5 (cid:2) UTR to control mRNA folding into secondary structure , which in turn modulates translation into protein ( 11 ) . Behaviorally Regulated Genes . For a proof - of - principle use of this resource , weperformedanexperimenttoidentifysinging - regulated genes . We constructed an 18 , 000 spotted cDNA microarray using all clones isolated ( Appendix section 3 . 7 ) . We then excised four song nuclei [ high vocal center ( HVC ) , robust nucleus of the arcopallium ( RA ) , lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium ( LMAN ) , and AreaX ] from brain sections of silent and singing ( 1 h ) birds , generated fluorescently tagged probes , and hybridized them to the microarrays in 3 or 4 replicate experiments per vocal nucleus ( Fig . 14A and Table 4 ) . We verified that egr - 1 and c - fos mRNA were regulated by singing ( 4 , 5 ) , and they showed 2 - to 30 - fold increases , depending on vocal nucleus , array replicate , and spotted DNA concentration ( Fig . 14 C and D ) . Using these cDNAs as a standard , we identified others that showed a (cid:3) 1 . 8 - fold differ - ence in at least two or three of three or four replicates , respectively , in multiple vocal nuclei in some cases and , when available , across multiple clones with identical sequence annotations ( Appendix section 3 . 7 ) ; 150 genes met this criterion ( not including egr - 1 and c - fos ) . Of these , we selected 41 for in situ verification and found that 4 ( (cid:1) 10 % ) were false positive ( Table 5 ) , because they showed no differences in vocal nuclei across groups or birds ; 6 ( 13 % ) showed differences in vocal nuclei across individual birds but not across groups ( Table 5 and Fig . 15 ) ; and 31 ( (cid:1) 76 % ) showed verified increased ( 29 genes ) or decreased ( 2 genes ) expression in vocal nuclei of singing birds ( Figs . 2 and 3 A ) . Most ( 78 % ) of the singing - regulated genes had not been previously described as being driven by singing or behavior . Four were previously found to be heat - shock sensitive , and another six were found to be neural - activity induced ( Fig . 3 A ) , indicating their possible classification as immediate early genes . The functions of all 33 singing - regulated genes ( including egr - 1 and c - fos ) spanned a range of categories : signal transduction proteins ( egr - 1 , c - fos , c - jun , sim junB , Atf4 , Hspb1 , UbE2v1 , HnrpH3 , Shfdg1 , and Madh2 ) , chromosome scaffold proteins ( H3f3B and H2AfX ) , actin - interacting cytoskeletal proteins ( Arc , sim Fmnl , Tagln2 , ARHGEF9 , and (cid:2) - actin ) , a Ca 2 (cid:5) - regulating protein ( Cacyb ) , cytoplasmic proteins with enzymatic ( Prkar1a , Atp6v1b2 , and Ndufa5 ) , proteinkinase ( Gadd45 (cid:2) ) , folding ( Hsp70 - 8 ) , binding , and transporting functions ( Hsp40 , Hsp90 (cid:3) , and Hsp25 ) , and mem - brane ( Stard7 , Syt4 , and Ebag9 ) and synaptically released proteins ( JSC , BDNF , and Penk ; Fig . 3 A – C ) . Analysis of the 3 (cid:2) unique IDs revealed that many ( 10 of 12 with n (cid:1) 6 clones in the database ) were more represented in subtracted libraries ( Table 6 ) .

PNAS (cid:3) October 10 , 2006 (cid:3) vol . 103 (cid:3) no . 41 (cid:3) 15213 N E U R O S C I E N C E demonstrates that subtraction generally enriched for singing - regulated genes . The 33 genes can be grouped into four anatomical expression categories ( Fig . 2 ) : those regulated in ( i ) all ( Fig . 2 A ) major pallial vocal nuclei ( HVC , RA , and MAN ) and the striatal vocal nucleus ( AreaX ) ; ( ii ) acombination ( Fig . 2 C ) of1or2pallialandthestriatal vocal nucleus ; ( iii ) pallial ( P ) vocal nuclei only ; and ( iv ) the striatal ( S ) vocal nucleus only . AreaX had the highest percentage ( 94 % ) of genes regulated by singing ( Fig . 3 D ) . Time - course analyses ( Ap - pendix section 3 . 8 ) further grouped all genes into six statistically different temporal patterns ( examples in Fig . 4 ; all genes in Fig . 16 ) : type I , those up - regulated with peak expression within 0 . 5 h , followed by decreased expression as singing continues [ these were mainly the transcription factors expressed in all vocal nuclei ( Fig . 3 A ) ] ; type II , those also up - regulated with peak expression within 0 . 5 h but followed by steady expression as singing continues [ these were a transcription factor ( Atf4 ) and a putative actin - associated protein ( sim Fmnl ) in a subset of vocal nuclei ] ; type III ) , those up - regulated like type I but with peak expression at 1 h , followed by decreased expression as singing continues [ these were a putative transcription factor ( sim junB ) , an actin - associated protein ( Ta - gln2 ) , and a chaperone ( Hsp25 ) in a subset of vocal nuclei ] ; type IV , those up - regulated like type II but with peak expression in 1 h , followed by steady expression as singing continues [ this was the largest group , consisting of nuclear , cytoplasmic , cytoskeletal , and synaptically released proteins in all or a subset of vocal nuclei ] ; type V , those up - regulated with peak expression near or beyond 3 h ( the latest time measured ) [ these included structural ( (cid:2) - actin , H3f3B ) , enzyme ( Ndufa5 ) , and signaling ( Stard7 , Ebag9 ) proteins in a subset of vocal nuclei ] ; and type VI , those down - regulated within 1 – 3 h [ these were an actin GTPase ( ARHGEF9 ) and a protein of un - known function ( sim NPD014 protein ) in AreaX ] . Further analysis of the 3 (cid:2) unique IDs revealed that several of the 33 genes were represented at higher levels in the subtracted juvenile rapid vocal learning library ( # 0064 ; Table 6 and Appendix section 2 . 3 ) . We tested this possibility and found that Penk was regulated Fig . 2 . In situ hybridizations of singing - regulated genes .

We did not find juvenile – adult differences with c - fos , and it was not enriched in the subtracted juvenile libraries ( Table 6 ) . These results suggest that subtraction may have also been effective at isolating developmental differences . Protein Expression . To determine whether singing - induced mRNA expression is propagated to the protein level , we used the predicted amino acid sequences of select clones to identify antibodies made againsthomologousaminoacidsinmammals ( Appendix section3 . 9 ) and reacted them to zebra finch brain sections .

When including prior findings of c - fos and BDNF ( 5 , 6 ) , five of six genes tested show singing up - regulation at the protein levels , with the protein products designated to different parts of a cell . Gene Manipulation . To test whether our full - length cDNAs would expressproteins invivo , weperformedanexperiment withlentiviral vectors ( Fig . 17 A ) known to integrate into genomic DNA and express eGFP in mammalian neurons in vivo ( 13 ) and recently in transgenic quails ( 14 ) . The lentivirus constructs transfected zebra finch neurons and glial cells in vivo at a titer of 1 (cid:7) 10 6 to 1 (cid:7) 10 7 pfu (cid:2) (cid:4) l and expressed eGFP from the mammalian UbiC , EF1 - (cid:3) , and CMV promoters ( Fig . 7 A – C a ) . There was relatively little quantitative difference among viral vector variants for percentage of neurons transfected ( Fig . 7 Cb ) . There was consistent and stable eGFP expression from day 3 to at least 3 months after transfection ( Figs . 7 A and B and 17 C – E ) . Each injection was able to spread the virus in an (cid:1) 1 - mm 2 area . We custom - designed 5 (cid:2) - FLAG - tag prim - ers to PCR amplify the coding region of Gadd45 (cid:2) and Penk from the zebra finch full - length clones , which were then ligated into the UbiC promoter - lentivirus , replacing eGFP . After injection into zebra finch vocal nuclei or adjacent regions , these constructs expressedthemRNAandproteinproductsoftheinjectedGadd45 (cid:2) and Penk cDNAs , as well as the FLAG tag for Gadd45 (cid:2) , without the need to induce them by singing ( Figs . 7 D and E and 17 B ) . Synthesis of the ectopically expressed zebra finch genes also lasted at least 1 month ( Fig . 17 C ) , the longest period tested .

Relative to our preliminary ( 15 ) and other recent efforts ( 7 , 16 ) , an important feature is that we ensured an array that contains cDNAs representing transcripts from multiple animal states and that there is a mostly full - length collection of these cDNAs . Once a cDNA of interest was identified , the full - length cds of the cDNA allowed us to perform overexpres - sion experiments . They also allowed cross - species array hybridiza - tion with other songbird species ( Fig . 18 ) . Using this resource , we identified and characterized 33 singing - regulated genes , the largest collection of genes regulated by a natural behavior that we are aware of . We estimate that (cid:3) 100 genes may be regulated within several hours of singing , assuming we assayed up to (cid:1) 40 % of the genes expressed in the brain and characterized only (cid:1) 1 (cid:2) 3 of the potential candidates on the arrays . As proposed for egr - 1 ( 4 ) , the regulation of these genes is presum - ably driven by the neural activity that is associated with the motor act of singing . However , their varied anatomical profiles underscore the idea that neural activity cannot be the sole regulator of their expression ( 2 ) , because different genes are expressed in different song nuclei combinations and with differing basal levels . Such anatomical differentiation has been missed when activity - dependent genes were studied in cell culture , where often an underlying assumption is that such genes will be regulated in a similar manner in neurons regardless of brain location . Their anatomical and temporal patterns suggest that motor - driven gene regulation is a dynamic cascade , where interacting patterns of changing events occur in time . This cascade appears to begin with transcription factors in all vocal nuclei , followed by syntheses of subsets of multiple molecule types ( regulatory , struc - tural , enzymatic , ligand , andtransport ) indifferentvocalnucleiover at least six different temporal domains . Most of the later appearing mRNA products are present at high levels in vocal nuclei before singing starts , and many of them are considered housekeeping genes , such as (cid:2) - actin , actin - associated proteins , and protein - folding and chaperone molecules . Their presence in vocal nuclei before singing starts suggests that many of the genes play roles in cellular maintenance in the absence of behavioral performance . This supposition is consistent with one hypothesis on the role of singing - regulated gene expression ( 4 ) , namely , that it is a possible mechanism for replacing protein products that deteriorate during behavioral performance so that future production of the behavior can occur . Ourresultsfurthersuggestthateachvocalnucleushasuniquebut overlapping signal - transduction pathways that are activated during singing behavior . The majority of the genes identified were regu - lated by singing in AreaX ; the exceptions were synaptotagmin IV and BDNF , which were very low throughout the striatum . Many were also regulated in HVC , but RA and LMAN had much fewer , even when the expression levels before singing were appreciably high . This distribution is intriguing in that AreaX and LMAN are minimally required for stable song in adults , whereas HVC and RA are required for producing learned song ( 1 , 17 ) . Furthermore , AreaX is the only nucleus so far where we found genes down - regulated by singing ; one of these ( ARHGEF9 ) is a GTPase that acts as a molecular switch to regulate actin cytoskeleton formation during cell signaling ( 18 ) . Perhaps , relative to the pallium , the striatum has a higher proportion of signal - transduction pathways activated by behavioral performance . We caution , however , that AreaX is also the largest vocal nucleus , allowing more material to be obtained from it in brain dissections , and this may have allowed us to identify more genes in the microarrays . Because the in situ hybridization results , which do not discriminate across vocal nuclei , still showed that AreaX had the highest number of regulated genes , either this hypothesis is true , or other song nuclei have other genes not regulated in AreaX that we missed on the arrays . In regard to the former idea , it is intriguing that proenkephalin is regulated by singing in AreaX and HVC . Enkephalin , the mature processed molecule , is a peptide neurotransmitter that binds to opioid recep - tors and has been proposed to dampen excessive activation of striatal neurons by dopamine ( 19 ) . AreaX , followed by HVC , is the vocal nucleus with the highest dopamine levels ( 20 ) , and dopamine is released into AreaX by singing ( 21 ) . This idea of dampening excessive activation is consistent with the finding that 5 of the 33 singing - regulated genes are heat - shock proteins , which are involved in neuroprotection ( 22 ) . In conclusion , the above hypotheses can now be tested with the identified cDNAs , where experimental manipulations can be conducted to place the genes in a network . Methods Fig . 19 shows our research outline . Detailed protocols are described in Appendix section 3 , which includes description of the cloning vector pFLC - I ( Fig . 20 ) , modifications to the RIKEN 5 (cid:2) - cap - trapper methods ( 23 ) for cDNA cloning , improvements on har - vesting full - length clones in bacteria ( Fig . 21 ) , improvements to PCR amplifying and sequencing clones , and modifications of lentiviral procedures ( 13 ) to acutely express cDNAs in intact songbird brain .
