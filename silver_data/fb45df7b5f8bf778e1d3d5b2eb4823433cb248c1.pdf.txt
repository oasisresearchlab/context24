Ed . 2008 , 47 , 6172 – 6176 Far - field fluorescence microscopy techniques with increased spatial resolution have the potential to enable a refined understanding of the intracellular organization of cells with near - molecular resolution . In this context , reversibly photo - switchable fluorophores arouse interest as key elements for optical nanoscopy . [ 1 , 2 ] Nonetheless , labeling of intracellular structures with efficient reversibly photoswitchable fluoro - phores remains challenging . To date , either photoswitchable fluorescent proteins [ 3 ] or pairs of fluorophores consisting of a reporter in close proximity to an activator are used . [ 4 ] Herein we show that conventional fluorophores can be used as efficient photoswitchable fluorescent probes . These probes can be reversibly cycled between a fluorescent and a dark state by irradiation with light of different wavelengths without the need for an activator fluorophore . [ 5 ] Conceptually analogous to stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy ( STORM ) , [ 4 , 6 , 7 ] iterative light - induced activation of sparse subsets of fluorophores allows their localization with nano - meter accuracy and enables the construction of subdiffrac - tion - resolution images . Because our approach uses conven - tional cyanine dyes ( Cy5 , Alexa 647 ) for cellular staining and does not rely on the proximity of two fluorophores attached to an antibody in a specific ratio and at a specific distance , [ 4 , 7 ] we refer to it as “direct” , dSTORM . We demonstrate the potential of dSTORM by subdiffraction - resolution fluores - cence imaging of microtubules and actin filaments in mam - malian cells with 21 - nanometer resolution . To surpass the diffraction barrier of conventional light microscopy in the axial and lateral directions , different methods have been introduced . These include standing - wave microscopy ( SWM ) [ 8 ] approaches such as 4Pi [ 9 ] or wide - field I 5 M microscopy [ 10 ] and saturated structured - illumi - nation microscopy ( SSIM ) , [ 11 ] as well as dynamic concepts such as dynamic saturation optical microscopy ( DSOM ) . [ 12 ] Recently , several super - resolution far - field microscopy tech - niques have been developed that achieve 20 - to 30 - nm lateral and 50 - to 60 - nm axial resolution . These include stimulated emission depletion ( STED ) , [ 1 , 13 – 15 ] STORM , [ 4 , 6 , 7 ] photoacti - vated localization microscopy ( PALM ) , [ 3 ] and variations thereof . [ 16 – 19 ] While the optical resolution in STED micro - scopy is improved by efficient de - excitation of the excited singlet state of fluorophores by stimulated emission , the STORM and PALM approaches use reversible saturable optical fluorescence transitions ( RESOLFT ) [ 20 ] between two comparably stable states . These fluorescent and dark states of photoswitchable fluorescent probes can be reversibly trans - formed into each other upon irradiation with different wavelengths of light with relatively low excitation intensity . Using wide - field fluorescence imaging , fluorophore signals can be detected individually as long as simultaneously emitting molecules are further apart than the minimal distance resolved by the microscope . The position of single fluorophores can then be localized with nanometer accuracy by fitting a two - dimensional Gaussian profile to the individual point - spread function ( PSF ) . [ 21 – 25 ] Ideally , the localization precision depends only on the number of collected photons n and on the standard deviation of the PSF ( s ) and can be approximated by s / ﬃﬃﬃ n p . [ 21 ] Using efficient reversibly photo - switchable probes , the fluorescence emission profile of individual fluorophores can be modulated in time such that only an optically resolvable subset of fluorophores is acti - vated at any moment . Inspired by our earlier work on direct photoswitching of cyanine dyes , [ 5 ] we show that conventional Cy5 and Alexa 647 fluorophores can be switched reversibly between a fluores - cent and dark state with high efficiency ( Figure 1a ) without the use of an activator fluorophore . [ 4 , 6 , 7 , 26 ] This finding enables targeting of intracellular structures with conventional photo - switchable fluorescent probes , for example , commercially available Cy5 or Alexa 647 antibodies , Fab fragments , pro - teins , peptides , or any other ( bio ) molecule . To verify that individual cyanine fluorophores can be switched reversibly between a fluorescent and dark state , Cy5 - labeled double - stranded DNA molecules were immobi - lized on microscope slides and imaged in aqueous buffer ( Figure 1a ) . As shown previously , [ 5 ] Cy5 and the structurally very similar cyanine derivative Alexa 647 can be reversibly switched for hundreds of cycles between a fluorescent and dark state without the need of an activator fluorophore . Upon irradiation with red laser light at 647 nm , the fluorophores emit a constant number of photons ( typically several thou - sand per Cy5 molecule ) [ 5 , 6 ] and then switch to the dark “off” state with a rate constant k off , which scales linearly with the red laser power ( Figure 1b ) . The activation rate constant k on from the dark to the fluorescent state is also linear with respect to the green laser power ( Figure 1c ) . The required green laser power at 514 nm is about 200 times higher than in methods using an activator fluorophore [ 4 , 7 ] but still stays in the microwatt to milliwatt range . The linear dependence of k off and k on in the lower milliwatt range demonstrates that the switching rates and thus the density of fluorescent probes can be easily controlled by adjusting the red and green laser power . Fluorescence images were generated by total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy . The samples were simultaneously excited at 647 and 514 nm , and the laser power was adjusted to ensure that only a subset of fluorophores is activated at any time in the field of view . The resulting PSF measured from each activated fluorophore ( Figure 1d ) was analyzed by fitting a Gaussian function to localize its position with high precision .

The cluster of localizations shown in Figure 1e results from repetitive localization of a single Cy5 - labeled DNA molecule switching between the fluorescent and the dark state . By aligning the localizations from several clusters , a histogram was generated and fitted by a Gaussian function to yield a full width at half maximum of 21 (cid:2) 1 nm ( Figure 1 f ) . This result suggests a resolution of approximately 20 nm for fluorescence imaging with conventional fluorescent probes . The application of dSTORM for intracellular subdiffrac - tion - resolution fluorescence imaging of filamentous cytoske - leton structures is shown in Figures 2 and 3 . For immuno - fluorescence imaging of microtubules , mammalian COS - 7 cells were stained with primary antibodies and then with commercially available Alexa - 647 - labeled Fab fragments . Reconstructed images of microtubules were obtained by direct iterative stochastic activation of subsets of Alexa 647 molecules and subsequent position determinations applying simultaneous excitation at 514 and 647 nm . Typically , we recorded 5000 – 40000 frames at frame rates of 5 – 40 Hz , resulting in acquisition times of approximately eight minutes for a total image . During this time , no mechanical stabiliza - tion or drift correction was necessary . As can be seen in Figure 2 , the dSTORM images show better resolution than conventional wide - field epifluores - cence images of the microtubule network . The improvement in spatial resolution achieved with dSTORM is demonstrated with single microtubule filaments ( Figure 2c , e ) . From cross - sectional profiles ( Figure 2 f , g ) , we measure apparent widths of individual microtubule filaments of 35 – 50 nm . Compared to previous studies , this value is somewhat closer to the actual diameter expected for a single microtubule filament of approximately 25 nm , [ 27 ] because dSTORM can use smaller singly labeled Fab fragments instead of a set of primary antibodies and multiple labeled secondary antibodies . [ 7 ] Thus , the use of smaller fluorescent probes in dSTORM improves the intrinsic imaging resolution . Furthermore , commercially available fluorescently labeled primary antibodies , Fab frag - ments , or even smaller peptide tags can be directly applied for subdiffraction - resolution fluorescence imaging of intracellu - lar structures . This ability is exemplified using the fluorescent probe Alexa 647 – phallodin , a bicyclic heptapeptide that binds to actin filaments ( Figure 3 ) . G - actin fibers were polymerized on glass substrate . The dSTORM image visualizes single F - actin fibers , in contrast to the conventional fluorescence image ( Figure 3a , b ) . F - actin filaments play a central role in various types of motility , including muscle contraction and transport processes . In vivo , F - actin rarely exists as isolated single filaments with a diameter of approximately 7 nm but instead associates into bundles in which specific proteins separate individual filaments by approximately 35 nm . [ 28 ] The dSTORM images show a drastic improvement in the reso - lution of F - actin filaments as compared to the conventional fluorescence image ( Figure 3c – e ) . In some densely packed regions , filament bundles separated by less than 100 nm with a diameter of approximately 100 nm ( FWHM ) are clearly resolved in cross - sectional profiles ( Figure 3 f ) . These dSTORM results agree quantitatively with the size distribu - tion determined by other alternative methods . [ 29 ] Moreover , the cross - sectional profiles of filament bundles indicate the existence of smaller substructures , as expected for individual filaments separated by several tens of nanometers . In summary , we introduce a new and very simple activator - free method for subdiffraction - resolution fluores - cence imaging based on the photoswitching of standard organic fluorophores . Our dSTORM method enables the use of small , singly labeled , and commercially available fluores - cent probes for the specific labeling and imaging of intra - cellular structures with approximately 20 - nm resolution within minutes and circumvents the complicated double labeling of antibodies with activator – reporter pairs in a specific ratio and at a given distance . Furthermore , the method can easily be combined with protein tags , such as the SNAP tag , to specifically label target proteins in cells .

Experimental Section To study switching charac - teristics of the carbocyanine dye Cy5 in the absence and presence of the activator dye Cy3 , a 43 - base - pair single - stranded DNA was used in which Cy5 and the activator Cy3 were separated by nine base pairs . [ 4 , 7 ] Complemen - tary strands of DNA were annealed to form biotinylat - ed double - stranded DNA ( dsDNA ) by mixing equi - molar amounts of the two complementary strands in 10 m m Tris – HCl ( pH 7 . 5 ) containing 50 m m NaCl ( Tris = tris ( hydroxymethy - l ) aminomethane ) . The dsDNA was immobilized on streptavidin - coated glass slides ( LabTek , Nunc ) . [ 4 ] The chambers were sealed by a silicon gasket . Single - molecule imaging was per - formed in “switching buffer” : phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS , pH 7 . 4 ) , con - taining oxygen scavenger ( 0 . 5 mgmL (cid:3) 1 glucose ox - idase ( Sigma ) , 40 m gmL (cid:3) 1 catalase ( Roche Applied Science ) , 10 % w / v glucose ) and 50 m m b - mercaptoethyl - amine ( MEA ) . To measure switching kinetics , the DNA samples were first irradiated at 647 nm to switch Cy5 into the dark state . The rate constant k off at which Cy5 - labeled DNA switches into the dark state was calculated by fitting the number of fluorescent molecules upon irradiation at 647 nm as a function of time to a single exponential function .

The reactivation with rate constant k on in the absence and presence of the activator Cy3 was determined by irradiating the sample at 514 nm while the red imaging laser ( 647 nm ) remained on . Thus , the number of active ( fluorescent ) fluorophores reached an equilibrium between activation and deactivation . The number of fluorophores in the active state at equilibrium was measured , and k on was then calculated from k off and the fraction of fluorophores in the active state at equilibrium according to the relation M active / M total = k on / ( k on + k off ) . African green monkey kidney COS - 7 cells were plated in LabTek 8 - well chambered coverglass ( Nunc ) . After 12 – 24 h , the cells were fixed using 3 . 7 % paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min . The fixed cells were washed five times with PBS and permeabilized in blocking buffer ( PBS containing 5 % w / v normal goat serum ( NGS ; Sigma ) and 0 . 5 % v / v Triton X - 100 ) for 15 min . F - actin was stained by incubation with Alexa 647 – phalloidin ( 10 (cid:3) 6 – 10 (cid:3) 7 m , provided by K . H . Drexhage , University of Siegen ) for 30 min and washed three times using PBS containing 0 . 1 % v / v Tween 20 ( Sigma ) . Microtubules were stained with mouse monoclonal anti - b - tubulin antibodies ( clone : 2 - 28 - 33 , Invitrogen ) for 30 min and then with Alexa - 647 - labeled goat anti - mouse F ( ab ’ ) 2 fragments ( Invitrogen ) serving as secondary antibody , also for 30 min . The labeling stoichiometry of F ( ab ’ ) 2 fragments was characterized to be approximately two . Three washing steps using PBS containing 0 . 1 % v / v Tween 20 were performed after each staining step . Before dSTORM imaging , the PBS buffer was replaced by switching buffer . G - actin monomers from bovine muscle ( Sigma , 5 m m ) were polymerized in untreated LabTek chambers in the presence of 10 m m imidazole·HCl at pH 7 . 2 , 100 m m KCl , 2 m m MgCl 2 , and 1 m m ATP . Subsequently , the surface was incubated with Alexa 647 – phalloidin ( 10 (cid:3) 5 – 10 (cid:3) 7 m ) for 60 – 120 min and washed three times using PBS containing 0 . 1 % v / v Tween 20 . Fluorescence imaging was performed on an Olympus IX - 71 applying an objective - type total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) configuration using an oil - immersion objective ( PlanApo 60x , NA 1 . 45 , Olympus ) . Two continuous - wave laser beams of an argon – krypton laser ( Innova 70C , Coherent ) were selected by an acousto - optic tunable filter ( AOTF ) and used simultaneously for readout and activation . The laser beams were coupled into the microscope objective by a polychromic beamsplitter ( 532 / 647 , AHF Analysentechnik ) . Fluorescence light was spectrally filtered with two filters ( 700DF75 and HQ542LP , AHF Analysentechnik ) and imaged on an EMCCD camera ( Andor Ixon DV897DCS - BV ) . Additional lenses were used to achieve a final imaging magnification of 100 to 225 times , that is , a pixel size from 160 to 70 nm . Typical laser powers used for dSTORM imaging were 0 . 25 mW ( 514 nm ) and 15 mW ( 647 nm ) . The laser powers were chosen to ensure that the fraction of activated fluorophores at any given time was sufficiently low to allow the recognition of individual fluorophores . Typically , we recorded 5000 – 40000 frames at frame rates of 5 – 40 Hz . Applying a laser power of 15 mW at 647 nm , we detected 300 – 500 photons in 50 ms per molecule , corresponding to an average precision of single - molecule localization of 15 – 20 nm . [ 21 ] Under these imaging conditions , an average fluorophore remains in the active state for several frames after activation , resulting in several thousand photons detected per molecule and switching cycle . Fluorescent spots identified in each image frame were fit to a Gaussian function to determine their center of mass . Spots appearing too dim , too wide , or too elliptical were discarded from further analysis . [ 7 ] For image reconstruction , each actual pixel was partitioned into ten subpixels , resulting in a pixel size from 16 to 7 nm , and each center of mass calculated from individual fluorophores was assigned to a particular subpixel . The brightness is determined by the number of localizations falling into a subpixel . Received : May 21 , 2008 Published online : July 22 , 2008 .
