Ofthese mechaninns , the mntal rotation task [ I ] is the one of the best s + a & ed . When subjects decide whether two shapes presented at various orientations an : the identical or minur images , their reaction time increases with the angle of rotation between the shapes . Recent fMR1 and MEG studies [ 2 ] , [ 3 J revealed that activities of the premotor area andior the parietal association area are related to the angular difference between two objects . However , there = . two lands of degree of dlffidty in the mental rotation task of threpdimensional objects . One is based on the angula dfference and the other is based on the rutation method itself . It is 1 E I & say to evaluate the a & vi & s for a mental rotatron task keeping these two difficulties m mind . Methods The visual stimuli of this experiment were generated by combining a basic image and a rotated image ( Fig . 1 ) . There are three Variations of the basic image . To generate a rotated image , thae w m two types of rotation methd a 2 - D totation ( not changing the portion I image which is visible with rotation ) md a 3 - D rotation ( changmg the portion which is visible with rotation ) , six kinds of rotation angles ( Oo , @ lo , 120Â° , lEO " , 2M0 , 300 ' ) and two versions of the rotated image , the identical version and the minor version . These visual stimuli were presented on a sc ~ een in the left visual field in randomized order . Stimulus onset asynchrony is randomized from 1 . 3 sto 2 . 9 s . Six normal right - handed volunteers with no neurological disorders example participated in this experiment - All subjects gave their i n f o r m e d consent to participate . They were four mala and two female ranging in age f " 23 to 31 years . In this experiment , they w m tcquired to hate on the cross at the center of a & rem duringthe experiment and to mentally L ' i * a ~ - ~ ~ ~ a i e ~ o i p ~ e J rotate objects to d e mvd discrimination as to whether a visual stimulus was an identical pair or a mirrored pair without any body movements . The perfumce of the subjects is sufficient as judged by measuring ~ sponse time prior to MEG experiment . j i - ih 1 . Disccussion Activities in the right occipital area contralateral to the left visual stimulus field were found in eight out of 12 cases in the range of 150 - 200 ms . On the other hand , no activities were found in the lek These ~ sults are consistent with contralateral dominance of the anatomical c " . researches showed activities of both parietal association iilpa for the mental rotation of tbreedmensional object [ 2 ] . In th ~ s study , activities of t h e areas were estimated in both 2 - D and 3 - D mtation . This result supprts fMRl researches . In addition to this result , the number of subjects , whose activities of posterior part of both parietal association areas were esfimaM was i n c r e a s e d in 3 - B rotation comparing with 2 - D rotation . Fmm this result , it is implied that thee activities are related to the d e w of difficulties of rotation method itself . In addition to these result , activities were observed in the w w part of parid association area ipsilateral to those in the pemm area in two out of four cases in 2 - D rotation and in three out of tluee cases in 3 - D rotation 3 - D rotation rquks subjects to imagine the invisible parts of visual stimuli for judging whether the visual stimulus is an identical pair or not . We think this requirement activates the hntupaietal cimit which is used in visuo - motor tasks . Ref - [ l ] ILN . Shepd J . Metzkr , Science , 191 , 952 - 954 ( 1971 ) [ 2 ] K . Jordan , HJ .
