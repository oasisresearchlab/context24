Getting on the Board : The Presence of Women in Political Science Journal Editorial Positions Mary Stegmaier , University of Missouri Barbara Palmer , Baldwin - Wallace College Laura van Assendelft , Mary Baldwin College ABSTRACT Although the overall representation of women in the ﬁeld of political science has increased gradually over the last several decades , most gains are being achieved at junior levels . When considering the status of women in the profession , it is instructive to incorporate information on the presence of women in editorial positions at top - ranked political science journals . Our 2010 snapshot of women editors in the top 50 journals in the ﬁeld ﬁnds that on average , women are reasonably well represented in editorial positions in proportion to the ranks they hold in the profession overall and at PhD - granting institu - tions ; however , substantial variation exists across journals . Our discussion of the role - model eﬀect and the gatekeeping power of editors suggests that greater inclusion of women and others who bring diﬀerent perspectives to research could result in a more vibrant range of research topics and methodological approaches published in a journal . T he overall representation of women in the ﬁeld of political science has gradually , but slowly , increased . The American Political Science Association ( APSA ) reports an increase of women from 19 % in 1991 to 29 % by 2010 , with most gains being achieved at the junior levels ( APSA 2010 ; Sedowski and Britnall 2007 ) . As table 1 shows , in 2010 , 40 % of assistant professors , 30 % of associate pro - fessors , and 19 % of full professors were women . Although the “chillyclimate”forwomeninpoliticalscienceappearstobewarm - ing , chronic underrepresentation of women continues . Decades of research on the status of women attempt to explain this limited progress . Most recently , APSA’s work through its Committee on the Status of Women and workshops on women’s advancement inpoliticalscienceidentifyfourprimarybarriersthatpersist . First , there is a “leaking pipeline” ; women are leaving the profession for alternative careers . Second , for women trying to balance work and family , childbearing years typically correspond with the heavy academic demands associated with tenure and promotion . This can make it diﬃcult for parents to meet the research expectations for tenure , which results in some women leaving academia and others being denied tenure and promotion . Third , the institu - tional climate is often “inhospitable” to women , failing to provide the mentoring and support needed for women to succeed in the profession . Finally , a culture of research continues to provide max - imum reward for single - authorship rather than collaborative research ( “Women’s Advancement” 2005 ) . These forces com - bined stagnate the progress made by women , particularly at the senior levels . Because journal editors and editorial board members are selected based on their demonstrated expertise in a research area , serving in an editorial position is one measure of senior - level pro - fessional advancement and success . Editors have a strong inﬂu - ence in determining the direction of the discipline through their decisions on what research is published and what is rejected . Care - fully reviewing articles and making editorial decisions is a time - consuming process that often eats into one’s own research time .

As such , when we consider the status of women in the profession , it isinstructivetoincorporateinformationonthepresenceofwomen in editorial positions at top - rated political science journals . Research on women on the editorial boards of major journals in other disciplines shows a lack of parity among women and men . In the ﬁeld of medicine , for example , a 2001 article demon - strated that women have increased to 42 % of all medical students , yet in the 12 major medical journals only 25 % had women as edi - tors and an average of only 17 % as board members . ( Kennedy et al . 2001 ) . A more recent study on the composition of 93 medical soci - ety and journal boards found similar results ; 17 % of board mem - berswerewomen ( MortonandSonnad2007 ) . Researchconducted in the ﬁeld of management in 2004 found that the percentage of women on the editorial boards of 57 journals ranged from zero to 47 % , withwomencomposinglessthan10 % ofeditorialboardmem - bers on 12 journals ( Metz and Harzing 2009 ) . While reports documenting the presence of women on journal boards exist for a few disciplines , no such work exists in political science . Using original data we collected , we address this void by assessing the presence of women serving as editors and on edito - rial boards of political science journals . We have found that , while women are not well represented among senior faculty in political science , women are relatively well represented given their pres - ence in the discipline , in editorial positions among the top - ranked political science journals . In other words , the proportion of women as editors , associate editors , and editorial and advisory board members is reasonably close to the proportion of senior women in the ﬁeld . Our analysis serves as a starting point for continuing discussions about the status of women in political sci - ence and for future studies examining changes in editorial board compositions . OUR DATA Using the “relative impact” ranking of political science journals developed by Garand et al . ( 2009 , 699 – 701 ) , we reviewed journal editorial information from the 50 top - ranked journals by access - ing their websites in February and March 2010 . 1 Garand and his colleagues conducted an Internet survey in 2007 of political sci - entists in the United States , Canada , and the United Kingdom ( N (cid:2) 1 , 695 ) asking questions that tapped into their assessment of 92 journals in the ﬁeld . 2 While Garand and colleagues rank the relative impact of all 92 journals , in this article we focus on the top 50 , as this group provides a wide range of subﬁelds and aca - demic perspectives . The appendix presents the list of the 50 jour - nals included in our analysis , as well as the original data we collected for each journal . The gender of the editor was assumed from ﬁrst names , and if this was unclear , additional research was done to ﬁnd a pronoun or photo of the person . We compiled this information for the positions of editor , associate editor , and mem - bers of editorial and advisory boards . THE RELATIVELY GOOD NEWS : THE PRESENCE OFWOMEN IN EDITORIAL POSITIONS Table 1 provides an overview of the proportion of women in the profession at the assistant - , associate - , and full - professor ranks in political science in 2010 . Because most editors and editorial board members are on the faculty at research universities ( Collins et al . 2010 ) , we have also provided statistics on women at PhD - granting institutions . As the table shows , the overall proportions of women in the profession are similar to the proportions of women at PhD - granting institutions . Table 2 presents the percentage of women in editorial posi - tions in the top 50 political science journals . The row labeled “edi - tors” includes the individuals who serve as the chief editor or the senior editor , co - editors , or individuals listed in the journal as editors . We did not count managing editors because of the varia - tion in their roles and responsibilities . In some cases , the manag - ing editor handles the day - to - day operations of the journal but does not wield any decision - making power . In addition , book review editors were not included in our data . 3 In general , a small number of people hold the position of edi - tor ; 95 people are titled editor among the 50 journals . As table 2 shows , overall , 78menand17womenserveaseditors , whichtrans - lates into women holding 18 % of the editorships . Because no jour - nal employs more than one woman as editor , women work as editors at only one - third of these journals ( 17 of 50 ) . Because the scholars serving in these positions are overwhelmingly associate or full professors , comparing these percentages to the percentage of women at these faculty ranks listed in table 1 is useful . Women are 23 % of all senior - level professors overall and 25 % of senior - level professors at PhD - granting institutions . This suggests that , although the percentages do not exactly match , women are rea - sonably well represented as editors of political science journals . 4 The number of editors for each journal varies across journals . Some just have one editor , while others have two , three , or four . Surprisingly , as the number of editors for a particular journal increases , the number of women decreases . Out of 20 journals that have single editors , women serve as editors for ﬁve ( 25 % ) , Political Theory , Politics and Society , Annals of the American Acad - emy , Law and Society Review , and International Aﬀairs . Of the 18 journals that have two editors , 11 have two men ( 61 % ) , seven ( 39 % ) have a one man and one woman . No journal has two women who serve as editors . Among the seven journals with three editors , ﬁve of these ( 71 % ) have no women at all , and two of them , the British JournalofPoliticalScience andthe EuropeanJournalofInternational Relations , have two men and one woman ; out of the 21 people who serve as editors of these seven journals , only two , or less than 10 % , are women . The Journal of Law and Economics has four editors , all men . Political Psychology also has four editors , one of which is a woman . Amongtheeditorsofthe AmericanPoliticalScienceReview , one of the eight editors is a woman . Thirty journals on the top 50 list have multiple editors with women making up 16 % of these Table 1 Women in the Political Science Profession , 2010 THEPROPORTIONOFWOMEN OVERALL ATPHD - GRANTING INSTITUTIONS Assistant Professors 40 % 39 % Associate Professors 30 % 32 % Full Professors 19 % 20 % Senior Professors ~ Associate & Full ! 23 % 25 % At All Ranks 29 % 27 % DataprovidedbytheAmericanPoliticalScienceAssociation The Profession : Women in Political Science Journal Editorial Positions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 800 PS • October 2011 editors . Seven of these 30 journals , 23 % , have an equal represen - tation of men and women , and these journals all have two editors . Whereas most journals in political science have multiple editors , fewer women serve as editors for these journals . In essence , our results show that women are more likely to serve as single editors rather than as part of a team . Many journals have a group of associate editors who handle the review process and provide expert advice to the editors in the decision - making process . In table 2 , in the row entitled “editors and associate editors , ” we expand our count to include individu - als with the title of associate editor . With this expansion , there are 150 people who hold the title of editor or associate editor , and the percentage of women involved in the decision making process increases from 18 % to 23 % , which is quite close to the proportion of senior women in the profession and at PhD - granting institu - tions . There are 37 men and 18 women with the title of associate editor , indicating that women are 33 % of the associate editors . It is noteworthy that women are almost twice as likely to have the title of “associate editor” than the title of “editor , ” but the number of journals with no women drops from 32 to 25 out of the 50 journals on the list . Half of the top 50 journals in political science have at least one woman as an editor or associate editor . The impact of including associate editors in our analysis var - ies from journal to journal . Relatively few , only 13 , journals have associateeditors . Forexample , the AmericanPoliticalScienceReview does not use associate editors . The Journal of Conﬂict Resolution and Party Politics both have one . The American Journal of Political Science hassix , and WorldPolitics andthe JournalofPeaceResearch both have the most at nine . Among the journals that have associ - ate editors , one , Law and Society Review , has more associate edi - tors that are women , with one man and three women , bringing their total number of all editors to one man and four women . One other journal , the American Journal of Political Science , has gender parity among its associate editors , with three men and three women , bringing their total editorial staﬀ to four men and three women . World Politics has ﬁve male and four female associate edi - tors . In contrast , the Journal of Peace Research has eight men and one woman . Four of the journals with associate editors had no women in that position . For seven journals , the inclusion of associate editors increases the percentage of women editors on their staﬀs , and for some , dramatically . The American Journal of Political Science increases their representation of women from 0 % to 43 % , World Politics increases from 0 % to 40 % , and Philosophy and Public Aﬀairs increases from 0 % to 33 % . For two journals , the inclusion of asso - ciate editors decreases the representation of women . Inter - national Studies Quarterly , which has one male and one female editor , declines from an editorial staﬀ of 50 % women to 20 % women with the addition of associate editors . Law and Society Review , with a single female editor , declines from a 100 % female editorial staﬀ to 80 % . For four journals with associate editors , they still had no women represented in their editorial decision - making process . The presence of a female editor does not appear to be related to increasing the number of female associate editors . Only three ofthejournalsthathaveassociateeditorshadfemaleeditors . Inter - national Studies Quarterly has one male and one female editor , and three male associate editors . Public Opinion Quarterly has one male and one female editor , and one male and one female associ - ate editor . Only Law and Society Review has an editorial staﬀ led by a female editor , with one male and three female associate edi - tors . None of the journals headed by a single female editor employ associate editors . Thus , while the proportion of women who have reached senior ranks is reﬂected in the proportion of women who serve as editors and associate editors overall , there is a great deal of variation across journals . In the ﬁnal row of table 2 , we include data on the number of editorial and advisory board members . The names of these boards vary , butinclude“EditorialBoard , ”“EditorialCommittee , ”“Senior Advisors , ”and“AdvisoryBoard . ”Becausesomejournalshavemore than one such group , as we compiled the data , we counted all men and women serving on these boards or committees , recognizing that their roles and inﬂuence might diﬀer , but that serving on them is a form of professional recognition . The role of board mem - bers varies but can include work such as refereeing articles , pro - viding expert advice on the caliber of manuscripts , participating in the decision - making process about the future direction of the journal , andsolicitingarticlesubmissions . Insomecases , theboard members serve in honorary roles where their names elevate the prestige of the journal . All of the journals , except for the Journal of Law and Economics , have some type of board or editorial committee . For journals with boards , the average size is 36 members . International Studies Quar - terly has the highest number , with 100 editorial board members . Comparative Politics has the smallest , with only ﬁve members on its editorial committee . Editorial and advisory boards present an opportunity for journals to select a diverse group of scholars to provide guidance and to raise the proﬁle of the journal , with more than 1 , 700 people holding these positions at the top 50 political science journals . Indeed , we see greater representation of women when we look at the composition of these boards , with women making up 26 % of all board members . Although editors and asso - ciate editors are typically senior - level faculty , occasionally highly productivejuniorfacultyareinvitedtoserveontheseboards . Given this , the percentage of female board members comes close to the percentage of all female faculty , 29 % , and the percentage of female faculty at PhD - granting institutions , 27 % . Overall women are reasonably well represented on editorial boards in proportion to their presence in the discipline , yet the gender composition on speciﬁc boards varies substantially . Of the 50 journals , 15 have less than 20 % female representation on their boards , with the History of Political Thought ranking the lowest with no women on its 12 - member consulting editors board . At the other end of the spectrum , seven journals come close to gender parity , with more than 40 % of their board members as women , including the Journal of Politics , Perspectives on Politics , PS , and Law and Society Review . One journal , the Canadian Journal of Polit - ical Science , has 10 men and 10 women on its advisory board .

PS • October 2011 801 No relationship between having a high percentage of women editors and having a board with a high percentage of women is apparent . Among the seven journals with the most women on their boards , three have no women as editors or associate editors . In contrast , Politics and Society has only one female editor and a board that is comprised of 44 % women . There is little evidence that having a diverse board is systematically used as a strategy to balanceoutanall - maleeditorialteam . Forjournalswithnofemale editors , the percentage of women on their boards ranges from 11 % to 49 % and averages 25 % . This percentage is just slightly lower than the overall average , in which women are 26 % of an editorial or advisory board . One journal stands out on our list for having achieved gender parity in all of its positions , the Canadian Journal of Political Sci - ence . This journal has one male and one female editor and , as mentioned above , an equal number of men and women on its board . As the journal of the Canadian Political Science Associa - tion and the Société québécoise de science politique , each associ - ation selects one co - editor , and each co - editor nominates editorial board members subject to the respective association’s approval . While neither the associations nor the journal has an explicit pol - icy dictating gender parity , the current co - editors have con - sciously worked to achieve this . They have also paid attention to regional and subﬁeld representation on the board . 5 Twojournalsdevotedtopublishingresearchaboutwomenand politics did not appear on the top ranked list , but merit mention here . As one would expect , journals devoted to scholarly research on women in politics have strong representation of women in editorial positions . Launched in 2005 , Politics & Gender , the oﬃ - cial journal of the Women and Politics Research Section of the American Political Science Association , has two women serving as editors . Four of the ﬁve associate editors are women . The edi - torial board has 31 members , with 28 , or 90 % , women . Out of the 38 people on the entire editorial staﬀ , four are men . The Journal of Women , Politics & Policy ( formerly Women & Politics ) , also has two female editors . Its board has 36 members ; 34 , or 94 % , are women . Of the 38 people on this journal’s entire editorial staﬀ , two are men . DISCUSSION The editor and editorial board data presented here provide us with a 2010 snapshot of women’s inclusion in the central decision making processes of the ﬁeld’s premier journals . It is encouraging that , on average , women are reasonably well represented in edi - torial positions in proportion to the ranks they hold in the pro - fession overall and at PhD - granting institutions . Interestingly , women are more likely to serve as single editors than as part of a team ; as the number of editors at a journal increases , it appears that the proportion of women decreases . Moreover , tremendous variation in the presence of women as editors and on editorial and advisory boards exists across journals . In our informal conversations with journal editors , it is clear that editors are very aware of the importance of having diverse editorial staﬀs . However , our analysis of the representation of women in editorial positions further underscores some of the bar - riers that have been identiﬁed as hindering women’s upward mobility in the academia . First , journal editors and board mem - bers use their social and professional networks to solicit journal submissions . While male and female editors are likely to encour - age both male and female scholars to submit their research to the journal , it seems likely that on average , male editors will reach outtomoremen , andfemaleeditorswillreachouttomorewomen . If the editors and the overwhelming majority of board members are men , then fewer women may receive that “critical nudge” to submit their work to the journal . As anecdotal evidence of this , the co - editor of the Canadian Journal of Political Science noted new submissionsfromfemalescholarshaveincreasedsince2006 , when the journal made the decision strive for gender parity . Second , women in editorial positions serve as role models for graduate students and junior faculty members . Younger scholars see that professional advancement opportunities exist for them and that the profession is open to diﬀerent perspectives and lead - ership styles . Certainly both men and women can serve as men - tors although seeing someone “like you” in these prestigious roles is crucial . As we consider the advancement of women in our ﬁeld , the presence of women in leadership positions , such as journal editors , might encourage junior female scholars and graduate stu - dents to stay in academia ( see for example , Campbell and Wol - brecht 2006 ; Smith and Owen 2006 ; Wolbrecht and Campbell 2007 ) . Third , editors , associate editors , and board members serve as the gatekeepers to what research gets published and as such , they have a substantial inﬂuence in determining the future direction of our discipline . Through their decisions , editors determine the “important” research questions , the “appropriate” methodologi - cal tools , and the “worthwhile” perspectives . Greater inclusion of women and others who bring diﬀerent perspectives to research could result in a more vibrant range of research topics and meth - odological approaches published in a journal . Although our analysis here provides a preliminary discussion of the editorial composition of political science journals , it also raises some important questions . What explains the tremendous variation across journals ? What can journals do to address gen - der imbalances in their editorial leadership ? As a starting point , we oﬀer a few suggestions , while recognizing that more research is needed to identify best practices and explore current proce - dures at the journals where women have relatively high represen - tation . The Canadian Journal of Political Science can serve as one model , in that its editors made a deliberate decision to create a board that is 50 % men and 50 % women , which interestingly , actu - ally over - represents women relative to their numbers in the pro - fession . This approach , however , relies on editors being aware and committed to gender parity . Another possibility is that for journals aﬃliated with a professional association , the association executive committees or women’s caucuses could advocate for higher representation of women on these journal boards . Editors want accomplished scholars to serve as associate edi - torsandasboardmembers , buttheymightalsothinkmorebroadly about the types of scholars who could serve the journal well . For example , Collins et al . ( 2010 ) found that political science faculty members at non - PhD - granting institutions represented 16 % of authors in 26 political science journals between 2000 and 2007 , but that in 2008 they composed just 9 % of the editorial board members . While some men and women may not have published as many articles in as many prestigious journals because of higher teaching loads , university service , or family commitments , they could bring other skills and perspectives to editorial positions . Thus , as editors invite scholars to join their boards , they might consider the range of attributes that would beneﬁt their journal as well as the future of the discipline .

We realize the limitations of simply comparing percentages and have tried to qualify our conclusions throughout the analysis . If we assume that those se - lected to be editors and board members are a random draw from all senior professors , it is statistically possible that the proportion of women drawn from the sample is not going to match the proportion of women in the general pop - ulation . For example , the distribution of women for a sample of 95 editors should have a mean of 0 . 25 and a standard error of 0 . 039 . The t - score associ - ated with our ﬁnding of 18 % women is (cid:3) 1 . 308 . This has a probability of 0 . 097 in a one - tailed test , which does not meet the 0 . 05 signiﬁcance level to conclude that women are underrepresented . In other words , it is possible that a random draw of 95 editors from a population that is 25 % female would produce a sam - ple that is 18 % female .
