Endocytic transport of integrins during cell migration and invasion Patrick Caswell and Jim Norman Beatson Institute for Cancer Research , Garscube Estate , Switchback Road , Bearsden , Glasgow , G61 1BD , UK Early studies describing the endocytic – exocytic cycling of integrins prompted proposals that this process regulates cell migration . However , it is only relatively recently that more detailed descriptions of the molecular machinery responsible for directing integrin trafﬁcking have enabled us to properly address the role of these events during the various modes of cell migration . Here , we review recent advances in our understanding of the protein complexes and signallosomes controlling integ - rin trafﬁcking , and we describe how these inﬂuence cell migration and signalling events downstream of integrin engagement . Furthermore , we consider recent evidence for integrin trafﬁcking during the invasive migration of cancer cells through 3D microenvironments , and con - clude with a discussion of the use of novel photoactiva - table integrin probes to visualize these processes . Introduction Integrin heterodimers are crucial mediators of many cell – extracellular matrix and cell – cell interactions . In addition to their canonical roles in cell adhesion and migration , integrins make pivotal contributions to a broad range of cellular processes , including proliferation , differentiation and apoptosis [ 1 ] . They achieve this by physically linking the cell’s adhesive contacts to the actin cytoskeleton , and also by acting as signalling receptors to mediate down - stream intracellular signalling through , among others , the Rho GTPases , and the Src , protein kinase B ( PKB ; also known as Akt ) and mitogen - activated protein kinases ( MAPKs ) . Furthermore , signalling events transduced by integrins can operate bidirectionally ( i . e . not only can integrin occupancy modulate intracellular signalling [ out - side - in ] but internal events can inﬂuence the activation status and ligand binding competency of integrins [ inside - out ] [ 1 , 2 ] ) . For several years it has been known that adhesion receptors undergo endocytic – exocytic transport [ 3 , 4 ] . These descriptions of integrin recycling prompted the pro - posal of a mechanism whereby vesicular transport contrib - utes to cell migration by internalizing integrins at the cell rear . This in turn facilitates their detachment and sub - sequent transport within vesicles for re - exocytosis at the leading edge of the migrating cell . However , evidence supporting this model is not abundant . Many studies had proposed that the observed internalization and recy - cling of integrins implied that endocytosis is required in cell migration . Despite this , until 2004 there was little direct evidence detailing precisely how integrin trafﬁcking contributes to cell migration . Recent activity within this research ﬁeld has now illuminated more precisely how integrin trafﬁcking contributes to cell migration , and much new experimentation supports a mechanism in which both integrin endocytosis and recycling occurs toward the cell front , thus maintaining a spatially restricted , polarised distribution of cycling extracellular matrix receptors within this cellular locale . Moreover , it is also now clear that the inﬂuence of vesicular trafﬁcking on inside - out integrin signalling is likely to be pivotal to how these processes control the way in which a cell migrates . This was illustrated by recent studies on the crosstalk between integrins , in which a v b 3 was shown to suppress signalling downstream of a 5 b 1 by modulating its trafﬁcking [ 5 ] . This review discusses the ways in which this cycling population of integrin heterodimers might contribute to cell migration in both 2D and 3D extracellular matrix environments . We focus on work detailing the development of reagents and experimental paradigms that permit modulation of trafﬁcking through closely deﬁned and / or integrin - speciﬁc endocytic and recycling pathways . These studies are important because they enable us to determine the contribution that integrin trafﬁc makes to cell migration . Furthermore , we highlight recent research indi - cating that the way in which an integrin is trafﬁcked can dictate the way in which it signals to Rho GTPases , and that this in turn inﬂuences the persistence of cell migration . Finally , we consider the role of integrin endo - cytic recycling pathways during cell migration through 3D extracellular matrices and discuss how this might contrib - ute to cancer metastasis . Routes to integrin internalization Although it is now apparent that some a v integrins ( in particular a v b 6 [ 6 ] ; see section on ‘Integrin trafﬁcking in 3D’ ) are internalised by clathrin - dependent mechanisms , until recently , the evidence that clathrin contributes to internalization of b 1 integrin heterodimers was scant . Indeed , early experiments employing K + depletion – this disrupts the assembly of clathrin - coated pits and sub - sequent endocytosis – had argued against this possibility [ 6 ] . However , two independent lines of evidence have now shown that a subpopulation of b 1 integrins can follow internalization routes that are regulated by the AP - 2 clathrin adaptor ( Figure 1 ) [ 7 , 8 ] . Mutation of the AP - 2 adaptor - binding motif in the cytoplasmic tail of CD151 prevents internalization of this tetraspanin molecule [ 7 ] . This manipulation , although not measurably affecting Review Corresponding author : Norman , J .

Moreover , expression of internal - ization - defective mutants of CD151 inhibited cell migration on ligands for b 1 integrins , implying that cla - thrin - dependent internalization of a speciﬁc small sub - population of tetraspanin - associated integrin has a profound effect on cell migration on integrin speciﬁc sub - strates . Further evidence linking polarized clathrin - mediated endocytosis of integrins to cell migration has been provided by recent studies on Numb , a cargo - speciﬁc endocytic adaptor that interacts with components of the clathrin endocytic machinery , including a - adaptin and Epsin - 15 . Numb contains a phosphotyrosin - binding ( PTB ) domain . This domain can bind directly to b - integrin subunits [ 9 ] and co - localises with b 1 integrin in clathrin - coated struc - tures ( CCSs ) surrounding adhesion sites at the leading edge of migrating HeLa cells ( Figure 1 ) [ 8 ] . Furthermore , polarised endocytosis of integrin is imparted through the ability of Numb to recruit the polarity protein PAR - 3 , which in turn recruits aPKC . The phosphorylation of Numb by aPKC renders it unable to associate with integrins , a - adap - tin and PAR - 3 , and phosphorylatedNumb isnot recruitedto CCSs . Thus , although wild type Numb cycles between CCSs and the cytoplasm , non - phosphorylatable Numb resides in CCSs and prevents integrin endocytosis . This indicates that the sequential dephosphorylation and phosphorylation of Numb by PAR3 - bound aPKC contributes both to the polarized distribution of Numb in CCSs and to integrin endocytosis , processes that are both required for cell migration [ 8 ] . Numb also regulates polarized endocytosis of the adhesion molecule L1 in neuronal axons [ 10 ] and , intriguingly , mutation of the L1 AP - 2 – clathrin binding motif has been found to inhibit b 1 integrin endocytosis in other cells [ 11 ] . Although L1 is generally considered to be a neuronal cell adhesion molecule , it is expressed in other tissues and cancer cells , where it has been linked to metas - tasis [ 12 ] . Itisthereforetemptingto speculatethatalthough Numb might be recruited to the plasma membrane by associating with b - integrins , it might then act to drive the coordinatedendocytosis oftetraspanins , integrins and other adhesion molecules that contribute to the metastatic migration of cancer cells . It is clear that integrins can also follow non - clathrin dependent routes into the cell . The leukocyte integrin a L b 2 ( LFA - 1 ) has been shown to be internalised through a clathrin - independent cholesterol - sensitive pathway , a process crucial to cell migration or a L b 2 ligands such as ICAM - 1 [ 13 ] . Furthermore , a 2 b 1 internalization is known to be mediated by PKC and caveolae [ 14 ] , tempting specu - lation that caveolar endocytosis of integrins is also linked to cell migration . Moreover , a v b 3 , an integrin that can bind to Numb and thereby enter the cell through CCSs , can also be recruited to caveolae under circumstances in which cells are migrating [ 15 ] . However , issues concerning the respective contributions made by the clathrin versus non - clathrin pathways to integrin endocytosis remain Figure 1 . Routes to internalization of integrins . Proteins that have been shown to physically associate with integrin cytotails and to regulate their endocytosis are depicted in red , and the likely effectors of these are indicated in green . The right side of the diagram indicates the molecular complexes that have been shown to recruit integrin to clathrin - coatedstructures ; clathrintriskelia and their associated AP - 2 adaptorsare shownin shadesof blue . The central sectionof the diagramrepresents studiesdescribing physical associations of integrins that regulate internalization , but which do not resolve whether this is through clathrin or non - clathrin mechanisms . The left side of the diagram depicts internalization of integrins through non - clathrin - dependent mechanisms . Of these , it is known that a v b 3 and a 2 b 1 can enter caveolae , and that PKC a and dynamin have an involvement in this process . Review Trends in Cell Biology Vol . 18 No . 6 258 largely unresolved . Indeed , the requirement for dynamin [ 16 , 17 ] , and observations that both CCSs [ 18 ] and caveolin [ 15 ] can be clustered with integrins at motility - associated structures have both been invoked to support arguments favouring the involvement of either clathrin - or caveolin - dependent mechanisms in the internalization of b 1 and b 3 integrins . In reality , it is probable that a given integrin heterodimer follows more than one route to internalization within different regions of the same cell ; for instance , a subpopulation of a 5 b 1 is probably internalised into CCSs near focal complexes at the cell front , whereas the bulk of the integrin follows a non - clathrin pathway from other parts of the cell surface . Furthermore , we feel it is import - ant to note that one’s view of which of these pathways is dominant is dictated not only by the migratory status of the cell but also by the method employed to detect integrin endocytosis . Indeed , integrin internalization is commonly studied by monitoring the progress of surface - bound , integ - rin - speciﬁc antibodies ; and given the likelihood that the conformation and ligand occupancy of integrins deter - mines their internalization , these data must be interpreted with caution . For example , MAB1981 is a non - confor - mation - dependent b 1 - speciﬁc antibody that is not signiﬁ - cantly internalised from the cell surface of m 2 - adaptin ( AP - 2 component ) or clathrin - heavy chain knockdown HeLa cells [ 8 ] . Conversely , TS2 / 16 recognizes the ‘active’ confor - mation of b 1 integrin , and this antibody is internalised in clathrin heavy - chain knockdown HeLa cells [ 19 ] . These apparently contradictory ﬁndings can be reconciled , because it is likely that ‘active’ , ‘inactive’ and ‘total’ surface integrins represent signiﬁcantly different pools of integrin in terms of localisation and associated proteins , including components of the endocytic machinery . Irrespective of whether they follow clathrin - dependent or - independent routes to internalization , endocytic car - goes are trafﬁcked to early endosomes [ 20 ] , and the Rab5 family members ( i . e . Rab5 , Rab21 and Rab22 ) are key to these early post - endocytic trafﬁcking events . Rab21 , and to a lesser degree Rab5 , can form a complex with several different integrins , including a 2 b 1 , a 11 b 1 , a 5 b 1 and a 6 b 1 , by associating with the a - subunit cytodomain ( Figure 1 ) [ 21 ] . It is unclear at this point whether this interaction is direct , but endogenous Rab21 certainly co - localises with activated b 1 integrin within intracellular vesicles , and a GDP - locked Rab21 mutant prevents endocytosis of b 1 integrins and leads to their redistribution to large focal adhesions [ 21 ] . This suggests that endocytosis and trafﬁck - ing of b 1 - integrins mediated by Rab21 promotes focal adhesion disassembly and turnover . Indeed , evidence that an endocytic step contributes to the rapid turnover of b 1 - integrin - containing focal complexes is accumulating , and it will now be interesting to use imaging approaches to determine the contribution made by Rab21 and Numb to the endocytosis of green ﬂuorescent protein ( GFP ) - tagged integrins from focal complexes at the front of migrating cells . After endocytic transport and recycling of integrins As with other cycling receptors , integrin heterodimers internalise to early endosomes from which they can be either returned directly to the plasma membrane in a Rab4 - dependent manner ( the short loop ) or further traf - ﬁcked to the perinuclear recycling compartment ( PNRC ) before recycling through Rab11 - and / or Arf6 - dependent mechanisms ( the long loop ) [ 3 , 22 – 24 ] . These pathways differ in terms of the integrins they handle , and the signal - ling pathways that regulate them , as described below . Moreover , although recycling of some receptors , such as the transferrin receptor ( TfnR ) , is deemed to be constitu - tive , the handling of integrin cargoes by the endosomal system is likely to be tightly controlled . Indeed , growth factor - driven short - loop recycling of a v b 3 integrin through the Rab4 pathway [ 25 ] requires a direct physical associ - ation between protein kinase D1 ( PKD1 ) and the cytodo - main of the b 3 integrin subunit ( Table 1 ) [ 5 , 26 ] . By contrast , recycling of b 1 integrins from the PNRC is known to be controlled by Rab11 – as is the transport of the TfnR from this compartment – but in a way that requires the activity of pro - migratory kinases such as PKC e and PKB – Akt [ 27 , 28 ] , which phosphorylate the cytoskeletal protein vimentin and the Arf6 GTPase activating protein ( GAP ) ACAP1 ( Arf – GAP with coiled - coil , ANK repeat and PH Table 1 .

Furthermore , the involvement of Rab11 has now been reinforced by a study indicating a requirement for EH - domain containing - 1 ( EHD1 ) , the primary role of which appears to be in regulating the return of endocytosed cargo to the plasma membrane from the PNRC , in b 1 integrin recycling ( Table 1 ) [ 29 ] . It is also important to note that another EH - domain protein , EHD4 , binds to Numb and that this complex functions in Arf6 - dependent recycling , indicating that the role of EHDs and Numb in integrin recycling is linked [ 30 ] . More recently , research has demonstrated that ACAP1 mediates the connection between PKB and integ - rin recycling [ 31 ] . When phosphorylated by PKB , ACAP1 binds directly to b 1 integrin on endosomal membranes , and this promotes its recycling . Importantly , the phos - phorylation of ACAP1 by PKB is required for cells to migrate effectively and , although ACAP1 might play a role in the recycling of other membrane proteins , including growth factor receptors , this ﬁnding strongly suggests that ACAP1 - dependent stimulated recycling of b 1 integrin plays an important role in cell migration ( Table 1 ) [ 31 ] . A more recent study has shown that ACAP1 interacts directly with clathrin heavy chain [ 19 ] . Surprisingly , this interaction doesn’t seem to regulate integrin internaliz - ation ; rather , ACAP1 recruits clathrin to recycling endo - somes , thus forming a ‘recycling vesicle clathrin - coat complex’ [ 19 ] . The likelihood that clathrin is involved in ACAP1 – Arf6 - dependent b 1 integrin recycling presents a completely new face to the role of clathrin in integrin function and , importantly , highlights the caution that must be exercised in interpreting experiments that deploy small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) to knock down clathrin expression . Arf6 regulates the trafﬁcking of internalised membrane and receptors towards the plasma membrane and is prob - ably required for their eventual exocytosis . Furthermore , Arft is also found at the plasma membrane , where it has roles in the reorganisation of the actin cytoskeleton and in endocytosis [ 32 ] . These pleiotropic effects of Arf6 are probably due to the fact that its immediate downstream effectors are enzymes ( e . g . PtdIns4P5 0 - kinase ) that inﬂu - ence the PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P2 content of cellular membranes . Expression of the Arf6 - guaninine nucleotide - exchange fac - tor ( GEF ) , EFA6 or a GTP - hydrolysis - resistant Arf6 has been shown to increase the level of PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P2 at the plasma membrane and in enlarged intracellular endo - somes , the latter of which accumulate recycling cargoes , including b 1 integrins [ 33 ] . These data appear to ﬁt a paradigm whereby upregulation of PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P2 leads to internalization of PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P2 - rich membranes ( together with several associated components of the traf - ﬁcking regulatory machinery ) and their accumulation within intracellular endocytic compartments . Conversely , downregulation of PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P2 ( perhaps in part by down - regulation of Arf6 activity by GAPs ) might promote both the release of recycling vesicles from these intracellular compartments and their return to the plasma membrane . RNA interference ( RNAi ) of the Arf6 GEF BRAG2 ( Bre - feldin A - resistant Arf6 GEF ) enhances b 1 integrin function in cell spreading and adhesion , and increases cell surface levels of b 1 - integrin through a mechanism that could involve either suppression of integrin endocytosis or stimu - lation of its recycling [ 34 ] ; the methods employed by these authors did not resolve these two alternatives . Neverthe - less , this is interesting because inhibition of Arf6 is widely reported to suppress b 1 integrin recycling and to lead to an accumulation of b 1 integrins within intracellular endo - somes . The explanation for this apparent discrepancy is likely to be that pools of Arf6 at intracellular membranes and at the plasma membrane are respectively controlled by different GEFs . GEP100 – BRAG2 is of particular interest not only because it controls b 1 integrin trafﬁcking but also because it directly interacts with EGFR and transduces signals that activate Arf6 and promote invasion and metas - tasis [ 35 ] . In view of this , it would be interesting to deter - mine the effect that knocking down GEP100 – BRAG2 has on b 1 - integrin - dependent cell movement , particularly in the context of migration through 3D matrices . Endosomal trafﬁcking and integrin signalling The days when endocytosis was considered to be solely a mechanism by which growth factor receptor signalling is downregulated are now over , and it is now established that endosomal membranes form a platform for the assembly of signallosomes downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases ( RTKs ) . For example , growth factor receptor - bound protein 2 ( Grb2 ) , Src - homology containing protein ( Shc ) , and son of sevenless ( SOS ) homologue remain associated with epider - mal growth factor ( EGF ) receptors following endocytosis , thus enabling the continued activation of the Ras – MAPK cascade at endosomal membranes [ 36 ] . Conversely , active EGF receptors have been reported to have limited access to PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P2 in endosomes , implying that endocytosis curtails PtdIns3 - kinase signalling [ 37 ] . Additionally , the redirection of endocytic trafﬁcking from caveolar - to cla - thrin - mediated endocytosis shifts the fate of the transform - ing growth factor - b ( TGF - b ) receptor from lysosomal degradation to prolonged signalling through endosomally localized Smad2 [ 38 ] . Thus , the pathways taken to inter - nalise and recycle a receptor will inﬂuence its signalling , with regards to both the activation proﬁle of downstream kinases ( i . e . PtdIns3 - kinase versus MAPK ) and its kinetics ( i . e . transient versus sustained ) . Integrins are , of course , signalling receptors , and there is now evidence that the proﬁle of Rho GTPase signalling downstream of a 5 b 1 is dictated by how the integrin is recycled . There is thought to be a reciprocal relationship between the activities of b 3 and b 1 integrins [ 39 ] , and this is certainlyapparentwithregardstotheinﬂuenceof a v b 3over the trafﬁcking of a 5 b 1 [ 5 ] . In situations in which a v b 3 is actively cycling and competent in engaging extracellular matrix ligand , recycling of a 5 b 1 is slow . However , under circumstances in which a v b 3 cycling or ligand engagement is compromised , recycling of a 5 b 1 is strongly promoted . Moreover , this correlates with a marked increase in the capacity of a 5 b 1 to activate Rho - associated , coiled - coil - con - taining protein kinase ( ROCK ) signalling to the actin - sever - ing protein , coﬁlin . Furthermore , it is this cycling - dependent alteration in the signalling of a 5 b 1 , and not the loss of a v b 3 from the cell front , that causes cells to switch from directional to random cell migration [ 5 ] . The molecular details of how a 5 b 1 signals to Rho GTPases are Review Trends in Cell Biology Vol . 18 No . 6 260 currently not clear , and it will be interesting to determine the involvement of any of the known GEFs for RhoA in this process , and whether any of these are recruited to endoso - mal membranes by association with cycling a 5 b 1 . On a more general note , we think that the ability of a v b 3 to limit the cycling of other receptors and their signalling might have broad implications . Indeed , there are situ - ations in which a v b 3 is clearly inhibitory to cellular pro - cesses that are dependent on the signalling and trafﬁcking of RTKs . Indeed , the phenotype of the b 3 (cid:2) / (cid:2) mouse is one of enhanced tumour angiogenesis , which is largely due to increased VEGFR2 signalling [ 40 ] . Moreover , we have recently found that inhibition of a v b 3 strongly promotes the recycling of several RTKs , including VEGFR2 and EGFR1 , and that this has a profound inﬂuence on the proﬁle and kinetics of their downstream signalling ( P . T . Caswell , M . C . Jones and J . C . Norman , unpublished ) . Integrin trafﬁcking in 3D As we have seen , there have been some signiﬁcant advances in our understanding of the molecular machin - ery controlling integrin endocytosis and recycling ; how - ever , most of the data supporting key roles for these processes in cell adhesion and migration come from exper - imental systems in which cells are plated on 2D surfaces . In vivo , of course , cells do not migrate upon inﬂexible plastic or glass and , although these surfaces might be the most amenable to high - resolution imaging techniques , unfortunately they do not reﬂect the normal cellular environment . We feel that an important goal of cell biol - ogists working in this ﬁeld is to understand how integrin trafﬁcking contributes to cell migration in vivo and , in particular , how cancer cells invade the stroma during metastatic progression . a v b 6 integrin is upregulated in cancer , it is found at the tumour – stroma interface , and it is also now known to mediate haptotaxis and invasive migration [ 41 ] . Recently , the cytoplasmic tail of b 6 - integrin has been shown to interact directly with HS - associated protein X - 1 ( HAX - 1 ; see Figure 1 ) [ 42 ] . HAX - 1 was previously identiﬁed both as a component of a cortactin - containing complex involved in cell migration [ 43 ] and as an anti - apoptotic protein [ 44 , 45 ] . HAX - 1 is required for the clathrin - dependent internaliz - ation of a v b 6 , and targeted disruption of the b 6 - HAX - 1 interaction impairs haptotactic migration towards a v b 6 ligands , and invasion through matrigel . Moreover , HAX - 1 is also required for a v b 6 - dependent invasive migration in organotypic invasion assays , which more closely model the tumour stroma [ 42 ] . This provides the ﬁrst demonstration that endocytic trafﬁcking of integrins directly contributes to invasive migration , akin to that seen in metastatic tumours . For some time , Rab11 pathways have been implicated in aspects of tumourogenesis , and Rab11 itself has been implicated in hypoxia - induced invasion , which also requires a 6 b 4 integrin [ 46 ] . Overexpression of the Rab11 family member Rab25 ( also known as Rab11c ) is strongly associated with aggressive cancers – both clinically and in mouse models [ 47 ] – and it is also a prominent component of the ‘Condeelis invasive signature’ [ 48 ] . Rab25 is a speciﬁc regulator of a 5 b 1 integrin recycling and function , and it achieves this by binding directly to the b subunit of a 5 b 1 integrin in a GTP - dependent fashion [ 49 ] ; this was the ﬁrst identiﬁcation of a direct interaction between a Rab and an integrin cargo . Although stable expression of Rab25 in ovarian cancer cells has no discernable effect on random or directional migration across 2D substrates , it strongly promotes the invasion of ovarian cancer cells through ﬁbronectin - containing 3D - extracellular matrices in a man - ner dependent on the direct association of Rab25 and b 1 integrin , and on the function of a 5 b 1 integrin . Importantly , mutants of Rab25 that are unable to contact b 1 integrin are ineffective in this regard , and Rab11s engineered to be capable of binding to a 5 b 1 strongly promote invasion . Rab25 promotes the formation of long pseudopodial exten - sions as cells migrate in 3D contexts , and both Rab25 and a 5 b 1 integrin co - localise in relatively static intracellular vesicular compartments within the distal tips of pseudo - pods ( Figure 2 ) . Using a photoactivatable GFP – a 5 integrin to analyse the dynamics of integrin trafﬁcking in real - time has revealed two important characteristics of Rab25 - mediated integrin transport that give us key insights into how this process contributes to pseudopodial , invasive migration . First , it is clear that a 5 b 1 integrin trafﬁcs bidirectionally between intracellular Rab25 vesicles and the plasma membrane within the conﬁnes of the pseudo - podial tips . Second , Rab25 promotes the compartmentali - sation of a spatially restricted subpopulation of cycling a 5 b 1 within the tip regions of extending pseudopods as cancer cells move forward through a 3D matrix ( Figure 2 ) [ 49 ] . Perspectives and future directions Today , not only is it clear that membrane trafﬁcking is required for cell motility and polarisation but we are beginning to be able to assemble a picture of how and why particular integrin endocytosis and recycling events contribute to cell migration in a range of cell types and physiological contexts . Importantly , it has been the generation of reagents to selectively target integrin recy - cling pathways – rather than ‘blanket’ inhibition of recy - cling in general – that has enabled meaningful elucidation of the speciﬁcs of integrin trafﬁcking in cell migration . From this , it is now clear that endocytosis and recycling of integrins acts to promote the turnover of focal adhesions when cells migrate on 2D surfaces . Moreover , we are now beginning to realize that downstream integ - rin signalling is inﬂuenced by how the heterodimers are trafﬁcked , and it is likely that this , rather than a require - ment for their delivery to the cell front , causes migra - tional persistence to be inﬂuenced by endocytosis and recycling . Furthermore , advancing our understanding of cell migration in physiologically relevant 3D microenvir - onments has highlighted the role of both integrin intern - alization and recycling in invasive migration , a niche in which integrin behaviour is not well understood . A key challenge for the future is for us to determine more precisely how integrins that are shuttled between endo - somes and the plasma membrane within restricted cel - lular locales ( such as the pseudopodial tip region ) therein dictate signalling events controlling actin dynamics . It is such spatially restricted signalling from integrins to the Review Trends in Cell Biology Vol . 18 No . 6 261 actin polymerisation machinery that is the most likely route to regulating processes that ultimately determine the protrusive activity of invasive structures as cancer cells migrate through 3D matrices .

( b ) When tumour cells expressing Rab25 invade a collagen hydrogel containing fibronectin , their movement is characterised by the extension of a long pseudopod in the direction of migration . ( c ) In Rab25 - expressing cells , a 5 b 1 integrin is localized to the plasma membrane and to Rab25 - positive endosomes that reside near the tip of the extending pseudopod . Photactivatable integrin probes indicate that a pool of a 5 b 1 at the pseudopodial tip cycles rapidly between the Rab25 compartment and the plasma membrane , and that this prevents rearward movement of the integrin ( indicated by the cyan arrows ) .
