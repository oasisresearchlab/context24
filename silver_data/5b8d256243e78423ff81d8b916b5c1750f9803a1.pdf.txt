Methods : Between May 29 and July 2 , 2020 , a retrospective cohort study was conducted among two populations : requisitioned health - care workers and requisitioned staff from hospitals childcare centers , to investigate the virus circulation during lockdown , in a French area of high transmission . Results : The infection attack rate was 6 / 52 ( 11 . 6 % ) and 8 / 46 ( 17 . 4 % ) among health - care workers and childcare staff , respectively . An early epidemic occurred among Montreuil s hospital childcare staff , but the parents were not affected ( p = 0 . 029 ) . Among Aulnay - sous - bois childcare center , three staff members were infected but none of them was in charge of a child whose parents were infected . Also among the parents of the children they cared for , none developed antibodies . Out of 14 infections , 12 were reliable to a source of transmission , mostly among colleagues . Discussion - conclusion : The assessment of viral circulation among healthcare workers and childcare staff suggests that the children did not contribute to SARS - CoV - 2 spread in our setting . .

This lockdown had major negative effects on children’s social and mental health , with documented increase of domestic violence and exacerbation of previous social disparities ( 1 ) ( 2 ) . Most European countries have enforced school and preschool closure to mitigate transmission and may do this choice again , as the number of infections is currently increasing all over Europe . It is urgent to assess whether children lockdown might contribute to COVID - 19 control . Therefore , we have assessed how SARS - CoV2 has circulated among parents and caregivers in two hospital’s nurseries in an area of important SARS - COV2 circulation when the rest of the population was locked down . The TRANSEPS study We conducted a retrospective closed cohort study among hospital health - care workers who were affected to COVID units and entrusted their children to the hospital’s nurseries during lockdown on one hand , and requisitioned staff from those nurseries on the other hand . The 2 hospitals are located in Montreuil and Aulnay - sous - bois , two cities of Seine Saint - Denis , the French Department with the highest abnormal mortality rate during the first epidemic wave ( 3 ) . The aim of the study was to assess the viral circulation in those highly exposed adults , connected by 6 week to 3 year aged children , in order to identify possible viral transmission through the infants . Eligible parents had been in charge of COVID patients and had entrusted one or two children to the hospital’s nursery for at least two days between March17 and May 11 . Eligible nursery staff had been directly in charge of health workers’ children for at least two days during the same period . Masks were not required for staff members or children in the two nurseries but barrier measures were established differently : in Aulnay - sous - bois , the staff had access to protective masks and could choose whether to use them or not and the parents could access to the sections provided they wore a mask . In Montreuil , conversely , the childhood .

Between May 29 and July 2 , 2020 , all eligible adults were offered participation ( see Flowchart on Figure 1 ) . Except for seven , all consented and answered a face - to - face survey requesting details on history of symptoms , contacts , swab for nucleic acid testing , chest tomography and serological testing . Blood specimens were collected and SARS - COV2 IgG detection was done using either Abbott Architect© test ( detection rate 1 . 4 S / C ) or Elisa Euroimmun© test ( DO sample compared to calibrator : positive result for ratio > = 1 . 1 ) . Any participant with a positive serology at the time of blood sampling was considered as a confirmed SARS - COV2 infection . The infection attack rate ( IAR ) was defined as the proportion of all participants with confirmed SARS COV - 2 infection . This study received ethical approval by the Comité de Protection des Personnes Nord - Ouest II . 47 healthcare workers ( 25 in Aulnay - sous - bois , 22 in Montreuil ) and 44 nurseries staff ( 32 in Aulnay - sous - bois , 12 in Montreuil ) were surveyed and sampled ( see Table 1 ) . The identification of an outbreak among Montreuil hospital’s nursery staff led to invite incidentally an additional 5 parents whose children were cared for in that nursery during the study period and who were first not eligible as they did not work directly with COVID patients . Surprisingly , the IAR was not higher among the COVID units’ healthcare workers ( IAR 11 . 1 % in Montreuil and 12 % in Aulnay - sous - bois ) than among the nurseries’ professionals ( 41 . 7 % in Montreuil and 9 . 4 % in Aulnay - sous - bois ) . An outbreak has even occurred among the nursery’s staff in Montreuil without affecting the parents ( p = 0 . 029 ) . Description of Montreuil’s nursery outbreak and viral circulation among parents In Montreuil , four childcare assistants belonging to the usual team ( cases 1 to 4 ) and a staff member who came as backup during lockdown ( case 5 ) had positive SARS - COV2 antibodies . .

Her partner had COVID - compatible symptoms from March 17 . MN2’s symptoms started on March 10 , MN3’s and MN4’s on March 13 . On Mars 15 , MN4 was hospitalized for respiratory distress with confirmed SARS - COV2 diagnosis . MN1 , 2 and 3 worked in the same unit until lockdown reduced the nursery to a single unit , dedicated to requisitioned healthcare worker’s children . They had daily lunch with MN4 . MN5 developed typical SARS - COV2 symptoms later , on April 6 . He was in charge of interfacing with the parents at the admission and departure of the children . A sixth childcare assistant developed flu - like symptoms by late February , was on sick leave during the study period , and therefore not included , despite SARS - COV2 positive antibodies . Three parents had positive serology : a nurse from the emergency room ( case “Montreuil Parent1” or MP1 ) developed symptoms on March 21 , with microbiological confirmation on March 28 . The contaminator was probably her work - team , diagnosed by RT - PCR for symptoms on March 14 . MP1’s daughter has been kept out of the nursery from her mother’s symptoms onset ( March 21 ) until April 15 . A physician who worked in the Infectious Disease ward during the outbreak had 2 successive viral episodes : a flu - like syndrome on February 10 , during her maternity leave , solved before her daughter’s first stay at the nursery , then an isolated cough from March 21 , 2 weeks after close contact with 2 infected colleagues . RT - PCR performed on March 25 was negative . Two chickenpox - like vesicles ( blisters ? ) compatible with dermatological COVID lesions appeared on her infant’s leg on April 15 ( 4 ) . A nurse assistant ( MP3 ) developed SARS - COV2 antibodies without any history of symptoms . From April 21 , she was posted in the COVID geriatrics department , where she shared resting time and room with four colleagues whose infection was retrospectively confirmed by PCR . One in particular was the nurse she worked in tandem with : they shared .

It is noteworthy that a 2 - year - old child who attended the nursery from March 17 to May 5 was hospitalized on May 13 for a Kawasaki - like vasculitis . Repeated microbiological as well as serological tests remained negative for him and for both of his parents . Viral circulation among nursery staff and parents’ from Aulnay - sous - bois Hospital In the second nursery , three childhood professionals and three parents from COVID units were infected with SARS - COV2 . Two childhood professionals were in close contact together and both exposed on early March to relatives clinically suspected of COVID , while the third had no other risk factor than daily use of public transport . The three positive parents had all presented typical COVID symptoms , at different periods : March 26 , April 4 and 15 . They have all reported prior contact with a RT - PCR confirmed case , in a timeframe compatible with viral transmission : two with colleagues , the third in her private sphere . The childhood professionals in charge of this parent’s children remained negative . Discussion We examined transmission among COVID exposed health - care workers and among childcare professional in charge of their children and found no evidence for onward transmission from one group to the other trough the infants . Our results are consistent with other findings on early childcare settings , where child to staff’s transmission appeared unlikely to have occurred ( 5 ) ( 6 ) ( 7 ) ( 8 ) ( 9 ) . Out of ten Australian preschools monitored for a staff member or a child identified with COVID infection , forward transmission was only documented in one , where the index case was an adult ( 10 ) but in Utah , a 8 month old baby may have transmitted preschool - acquired COVID to both parents ( 11 ) . Overall , SARS - COV2 . CC - BY - NC - ND 4 . 0 International license It is made available under a is the author / funder , who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity .

One possible explanation for this low rate of onward transmission from children is the high frequency of asymptomatic infections in this population , as high viral loads were reported in pharyngeal swabs from symptomatic children ( 14 ) including 0 - 5 year old ones ( 15 ) . The relatively low IAR among the parents goes against our initial hypothesis of higher risk for directly exposed healthcare workers . This IAR is consistent with the global IAR among Montreuil’s ( 14 . 8 % ) and Aulnay - sous - Bois’ ( 13 % ) hospital staff measured on June 25 and pleads for the efficiency of barrier measures , especially as most of the adults cases were linkable to a colleague’s infection . Despite scare data on age - specific transmissibility , young children appear unlikely to initiate or propagate SARS - COV2 outbreaks : it seems reasonable to allow them to resume activities and social life . We declare no competing interest and no funding for this work .
