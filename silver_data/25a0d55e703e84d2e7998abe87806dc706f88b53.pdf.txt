Public trans - ports play a critical role in infection spread . Based on the data of nearly 4 billion smart - card uses , between January 1 , 2019 and January 31 , 2021 from the Mass Transit Railway Corporation of Hong Kong , we analyzed the subway travel behavior of different population groups ( adults , children , students and senior citizens ) due to the COVID - 19 pandemic and human travel behavior under different interventions ( e . g . work suspen - sion , school closure ) . Due to the pandemic , the number of MTR passengers ( the daily number of passengers in close proximity in subway carriages ) decreased by 37 . 4 % ( 40 . 8 % ) for adults , 80 . 3 % ( 78 . 5 % ) for children , 71 . 6 % ( 71 . 6 % ) for students , and 33 . 5 % ( 36 . 1 % ) for senior citizens . Due to work from home ( school suspension ) , the number of contacted adults ( students / children ) in the same carriage during the rush hours decreased by 39 . 6 % ( 38 . 6 % / 43 . 2 % ) . If all workers , students , and children were encour - aged to commute avoiding rush hours , the possible repeated contacts during rush hour of adults , children and students decreased by 73 . 3 % , 77 . 9 % and 79 . 5 % , respec - tively . Since adults accounted for 87 . 3 % of the total number of subway passengers dur - ing the pandemic , work from home and staggered shift pattern of workers can reduce the infection risk effectively . Our objective is to find the changes of local travel behavior due to the pandemic . From the perspective of public transports , the results provide a scientific support for COVID - 19 prevention and control in cities . Keywords : COVID - 19 , Public transport , Social distance , Human behavior , Subway Introduction Since first emerging in the end of 2019 , COVID - 19 has been threatening human lives and societies . As the Omicron variant first appeared at the end of 2021 ( Del Rio et al . , 2022 ) , it spread rapidly around the globe . By the end of October 2022 , more than 623 million infections and 6 . 6 million deaths had been reported globally ( WHO 2022 ) . The Omicron variant is highly infectious with a basic reproductive number R 0 of 4 . 5 – 10 , which is several times that of the Delta variant ( Baker et al . 2021 ; Halamicek et al . 2022 ; Davido et al . 2022 ) . As one of the cities with the highest population density , Hong Kong † Shujia Shang and Wei Jia contributed equally to this work . * Correspondence : zhangn @ bjut . edu . cn 1 Beijing Key Laboratory of Green Built Environment and Energy Efficient Technology , Beijing University of Technology , Beijing , China 2 Department of Mechanical Engineering , The University of Hong Kong , Hong Kong , China 3 The Research Institute for Trustworthy Autonomous Systems , Southern University of Science and Technology , Shenzhen 518055 , China 4 China Electric Power Planning & Engineering Institute , Beijing , China 5 Department of Computer Science , The University of Hong Kong , Hong Kong , SAR , China 6 School of Public Health , Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine , University of Hong Kong , Hong Kong , SAR , China Page 2 of 18 Shang et al . City and Built Environment ( 2023 ) 1 : 5 had a total of 2 . 4 million ( 32 % of the total population ) confirmed COVID - 19 cases by the end of December 2022 ( NHKG 2022a ) . Of the 10 , 000 plus reported cases after Febru - ary 2022 , more than 80 % of these cases were infected with the Omicron variant ( NHKG 2022b ) . Due to the high infectivity of the Omicron variant , interventions which had been effective for prevention and control of previous variants ( e . g . Delta ) were unable to meet the current needs , and a serious outbreak was triggered in Hong Kong . Close contact ( short - range airborne and large droplet ) , long - range airborne and fomite transmission are the three potential transmission routes for SARS - CoV - 2 ( Lotfi et al . 2020 ; Rahman et al . 2020 ) . Many studies have shown that close contact is the domi - nant route of COVID - 19 transmission ( Karia et al . 2020 ; Zhao et al . 2020 ) , Maintaining a social distance of 1 . 5 m is considered to be the most effective intervention for most respiratory infectious diseases including COVID - 19 transmission ( Qian and Jiang 2022 ; Sun and Zhai 2020 ; Aquino et al . 2020 ) . and researchers have emphasized the impor - tance of social distancing in disease prevention through modeling and simulation ( Chi - nazzi et al . 2020 ) . However , assessing people’s travel behavior is an important way to quantify social distancing ( Anderson et al . 2020 ) . Many countries and cities have imple - mented social distancing measures such as work suspension ( Ruiz - Frutos et al . 2021 ) , school closure ( Zhang et al . 2020 ) and limits on bars and restaurants ( Abouk and Hey - dari 2021 ) . Public transport is important for the local travel needs of residents . It not only pro - vides a venue for infection spread , but also connects people from different regions ( Zheng et al . 2020 ) . Therefore , prevention and control of COVID - 19 on public trans - port is particularly important . Taking influenza as an example , without mask wearing , about 4 % of infections occur during travel on subways ( Cooley et al . 2011 ) . Therefore , for public transportation using the subway as an example , it is very important to formu - late effective epidemic prevention and control strategies according to the travel behavior of passengers . Especially because of the omicron variant with a high basic reproductive number of R 0 pose a great risk of transmission . Based on data analysis and simulations , many studies have proposed interventions for COVID - 19 prevention and control on public transport ( Ozdemir et al . 2022 ; Shen et al . 2020 ) . However , these studies had a number of shortcomings . Firstly , individual differences were often ignored ( Zhang et al . 2021a ) , for example , susceptibility to viruses ( Vakili et al . 2020 ) , as well as transport system usage , differ according to age . Secondly , due to the lack of data concerning real human close contact behaviors , it is difficult to accurately evaluate close contact transmission in subways ( Nissen et al . 2020 ) . Finally , many studies did not base their results on real public transport operational data , and therefore cannot propose accurate strategies for COVID - 19 prevention and control ( Guan et al . 2020 ) . In Hong Kong , the subway , known as the Mass Transit Railway ( MTR ) , is the most used form of public transport , accounting for more than 40 % of local passengers ( Zhang et al . 2021b ) . For this study , we obtained nearly 4 billion smartcard use data for four population groups ( adults , children , students and senior citizens ) from January 1 , 2019 to January 31 , 2021 . Taking the four waves of COVID - 19 outbreaks during this period as examples , we analyzed changes in local travel behavior due to these pandemic waves . Based on the real people’s travel behavior before the pandemic , different interventions Page 3 of 18 Shang et al . City and Built Environment ( 2023 ) 1 : 5 ( work from home , school suspension , staggered shift travel pattern , and reduction on subway riding ) are proposed to ensure social distance , and by simulating the behavior of people under different epidemic prevention measures . This provides scientific support for strategies to deploy for COVID - 19 prevention and control in the subway system . Method Data sources Nearly 4 billion smartcard use data from January 1 , 2019 to January 31 , 2021 was obtained from the Mass Transit Railway Corporation ( MTRC ) of Hong Kong . This data included entry and exit station , the entry and exit time at the second level , the type of smartcard , etc . All transport system users were divided into four categories based on the card type : child ( aged between 3 and 11 ) , student ( aged between 12 and 25 enrolled in primary / secondary / high school , university , or higher education institution ) , adult ( aged between 19 and 65 excluding students ) , and senior citizen ( aged over 65 years ) . In addi - tion , pandemic - related data ( e . g . daily number of confirmed cases ) was obtained from the Center for Health Protection of Hong Kong ( HKCHP 2021 ) . The detailed data of smartcard swiping is shown in Table 1 . Study area This study aims to reduces the interpersonal contacts by changing travel behaviors to reduce the infection risk in subways . A typical subway train in Hong Kong consists of eight carriages , and each carriage is 22 m long and 3 . 2 m wide ( Baidu , 2022 ) . Due to the huge difference on local travel behavior between weekdays and weekends , local travel behavior and efficiency assessment for interventions for both weekdays and weekends were analyzed . Considering that many workers in Hong Kong need to work on Saturday , in this study , only Sunday was regarded as weekend . Rush hours : Rush hours are the times of the day when the number of passengers in the carriage reach the peak . The rush hours for adults ( Children / students ) were 7 : 30 – 9 : 00 and 18 : 00 – 19 : 30 ( 7 : 00 to 8 : 00 and 15 : 30 to 16 : 30 ) . Non - rush hours : Train operation period except rush hours . There were four waves of COVID - 19 outbreaks in Hong Kong between January 1 , 2020 and January 31 , 2021 . During each wave , we denoted the week with the highest total number of infections to be the pandemic week . Therefore , there were four pan - demic weeks during our study period , the weekly number of reported confirmed cases is shown in Fig . S1 . Detailed daily pandemic data from January 23 , 2020 to May 31 , 2021 is shown in Fig . S2 . The four pandemic weeks covered in this study were : Mar . 26 to Apr . 1 , 2020 ; Jul . 24 to 30 , 2020 ; Dec . 4 to 10 , 2020 ; Jan . 18 to 24 , 2021 .

City and Built Environment ( 2023 ) 1 : 5 in local travel behaviors , we obtained data from 4 weeks in 2019 corresponding to the same periods as the pandemic weeks of 2020 and 2021 , to act as control groups ( Mar . 26 to Apr . 1 , 2019 ; Jul . 24 to 30 , 2019 ; Dec . 4 to 10 , 2019 ; Jan . 18 to 24 , 2019 ) . The above smartcard swipe data was collected and analyzed , to determine : how local travel behav - ior had changed due to the pandemic and how non - pharmaceutical interventions ( e . g . work from home , school suspension , staggered shift travel pattern , and travel reduction ) influenced interpersonal contacts in subways . Data processing Not all smartcard data was valid to use , and the following three screening methods were used to screen the raw data . ( 1 ) The swiping record of smartcard for both enter and leave the station should exist simultaneously . ( 2 ) The entry and exit stations of a travel should be different . ( 3 ) The time of smartcard swiping should be within the subway’s operation time . After the above data screening , nearly 4 billion card swiping data from were obtained , and less than 5 % of them were invalid . Hong Kong Metro had 10 lines ( excluding Light Rail and High Speed Rail ) and 98 heavy rail stations ( MTR of Hong Kong , 2022 ) ( Fig . S3 ) . We utilized Dijkstra’s algorithm to generate the shortest path from any station A to any station B for MTR , Hong Kong . The shortest distance is defined as the minimum number of boarding stations , which includes the actual boarding stations and the equivalent stations for the inter - line trans - fer . The common inter - line transfer is considered as one station interval except for a few special inter - line transfers , that is , 3 stations for the transfer between Central and Hong Kong , 4 stations for the transfer between Kowloon and Austin , 5 stations for the trans - fer between East Tsim Sha Tsui and Tsim Sha Tsui and the transfer between Kowloon and Tsing Yi . We also obtained a weekly schedule for each train in each MTR line from the MTR website and Google map , which means that each train has its own number . And then we allocated each passenger to the corresponding train based on the following two principles . The first principle is to allocate each passenger an optimal route , includ - ing the boarding lines and stations , using the enter / leave stations of each passenger and the shortest path determined by Dijkstra’s algorithm . The second principle is to allocate each passenger to the corresponding train on the shortest path based on the enter / leave station time and the weekly schedule of each train . The passenger should arrive at the station platform before the arrival time of each train . Note that we also consider a 2 - min walk from the station gate to the station platform , a 2 - min walk for the common inter - line transfer and a 5 - min walk for the special inter - line transfer . Finally , we allocated 1 . 5 billion passengers to the corresponding MTR train in Hong Kong successfully . In this study , travel reduction - related interventions for COVID - 19 prevention and control in subways including work from home ( or AB work shift ) , class suspension , stag - gered shift travel pattern , and travel reduction were considered . Since the local travel behavior before the pandemic without any interventions represented the real condition , the efficiency of interventions in subways were analyzed based on normal local travel Page 5 of 18 Shang et al . City and Built Environment ( 2023 ) 1 : 5 behaviors during the non - pandemic weeks . All interventions for COVID - 19 preven - tion and control in subways considered in this study are introduced in Supplementary Information . Result Changes on local travel behavior due to the pandemic Due to the pandemic , the total number of MTR passengers decreased by an average of 41 . 0 % ( 37 . 4 % , 80 . 3 % , 71 . 6 % and 33 . 5 % for adults , children , students and senior citizens , respectively ) . During four non - pandemic weeks , 78 . 9 % ( n = 1 . 9 million ) , 3 . 5 % ( n = 0 . 08 million ) , 7 . 3 % ( n = 0 . 18 million ) , and 10 . 2 % ( n = 0 . 25 million ) of MTR passengers used adult , child , student and senior citizen cards , respectively . Where during four pandemic weeks , 83 . 7 % ( n = 1 . 2 million ) , 1 . 2 % ( n = 0 . 02 million ) , 3 . 5 % ( n = 0 . 05 million ) , and 11 . 6 % ( n = 0 . 17 million ) of MTR passengers used adult , child , student and senior citizen cards , respectively . Although the number of passengers decreased significantly , the daily number of sub - way trains remained unchanged ( Fig . S4 ) . Figure 1A shows the probability distribution of the number of passengers in the subway . Due to the pandemic , daily number of pas - sengers on the same train ( DPST ) of adults , children , students and senior citizens during Fig . 1 Subway riding behavior in the same train during weekdays and weekends before and during the pandemic by population group . A Probability distribution of daily number of passengers on the same train ( DPST ) ; B Hourly number of passengers taking the same train ( HPST ) Page 6 of 18 Shang et al . City and Built Environment ( 2023 ) 1 : 5 weekdays ( weekends ) was decreased by 37 . 2 % ( 52 . 2 % ) , 41 . 3 % ( 50 . 7 % ) , 43 . 4 % ( 53 . 7 % ) , and 33 . 5 % ( 49 . 8 % ) , respectively . Children had the lowest DPST of 637 , while adults had the highest of 792 . During the same period during a day , DPST changes little for all population groups ( Fig . 1B ) . In the weekday before ( during ) the pandemic , the ratio of the hourly number of passengers taking the same train ( HPST ) of whole day , rush hours and non - rush hours was 1 : 1 . 9 ( 1 . 8 ) : 0 . 8 ( 0 . 8 ) . In the weekend before ( during ) the pandemic , the ratio of the hourly number of passengers taking the same train ( HPST ) of whole day , rush hours and non - rush hours was 1 : 1 . 3 ( 1 . 8 ) : 0 . 9 . In rush hours of the weekday before the pandemic , there were significant differences in HPST among four population groups ( p < 0 . 05 ) . The HPST for adults , children , stu - dents and senior citizens were 120 . 3 , 68 . 3 , 102 . 0 and 64 . 9 , respectively . Adults and stu - dents have significantly higher HPST than children and senior citizens because they have to go to work and school . The distribution on contact time of four population groups was different ( Fig . S5 ) . In pandemic ( non - pandemic ) weekday , the average daily duration on the same train of adults , children , students and senior citizens on weekends was 4 . 0 ( 4 . 0 ) , 4 . 0 ( 3 . 8 ) , 4 . 0 ( 3 . 8 ) and 4 . 1 ( 4 . 3 ) minutes , respectively , which were 8 . 4 % ( 5 . 6 % ) , 6 . 9 % ( 8 . 0 % ) , 9 . 9 % ( 6 . 1 % ) and 4 . 6 % ( 3 . 4 % ) higher than them on weekday , respectively . A person may take the MTR with the same passenger many times per day . The prob - ability distribution of daily number of passengers on the same train showed a monotoni - cally logarithmic decrease ( Fig . S6 ) . More than 99 % of possible daily repeated contacts in the same train ( DRC ) were only once . The number of DRC during the non - pandemic weekdays was 1 . 6 times higher than it during the pandemic weekdays . Due to the pan - demic , DRC decreased significantly ( p < 0 . 01 ) , the average number of DRC of adults , children , students and senior citizens during weekdays ( weekends ) decreased by 66 . 8 % ( 75 . 4 % ) , 94 . 7 % ( 83 . 8 % ) , 88 . 6 % ( 83 . 3 % ) , and 59 . 5 % ( 73 . 4 % ) , respectively . Adults had the highest number of DRC with others ( the detailed distribution is shown in Fig . S7 ) . The frequency of possible repeated contacts on the same train ( FRC ) in subways changes significantly with time and population group ( Fig . 2 ) . Before the pandemic , the rush hours for adults were 7 : 30 – 9 : 00 and 18 : 00 – 19 : 30 . Due to fixed residential area and work places , many workers had a high FRC during the morning and evening hours , up to 60 , 000 . During pandemic weekdays , there was still two significant rush hours because work from home was not implemented for all companies . Due to the pandemic , FRC of adults in the rush hours ( non - peak hours ) decreased by 58 . 1 % ( 70 . 8 % ) . Children / students has an earlier and shorter rush hour than adults ( 7 : 00 to 8 : 00 and 15 : 30 to 16 : 30 ) . Due to the pandemic , FRC of children / students was reduced by 97 . 8 % ( 92 . 6 % ) during rush ( non - rush ) hours . Before the pandemic , comparing with weekdays , children and students reduced their FRC during weekends by 7 . 6 % and 19 . 4 % , respec - tively . However , due to class suspension , during the pandemic , FRC of children and stu - dents during weekends were increased by 182 . 3 % and 18 . 5 % , respectively . The pandemic influenced on travel behaviors , especially for children and students . Between 20 : 30 and 21 : 00 during non - pandemic weekdays , adults and children had a much higher peak of FRC than it during both morning and evening rush hours . However , due to the pan - demic , the FRC for adults and children was decreased by 92 . 0 % and 99 . 0 % during this Page 7 of 18 Shang et al . City and Built Environment ( 2023 ) 1 : 5 F i g . 2 T i m e - v a r i a n t f r e q u e n c y o f p o ss i b l e r e p e a t e d c o n t a c t o n t h e s a m e t r a i n o f f o u r p o p u l a t i o n g r o u p s Page 8 of 18 Shang et al . City and Built Environment ( 2023 ) 1 : 5 period , respectively . This showed that the pandemic had a significant impact on non - essential travel . The senior citizen had the minimal difference ( 3 . 2 % ) of FRC between weekdays and weekends before the pandemic . However , due to the pandemic , the FRC of senior citi - zens in weekends was 32 . 1 % lower than it in weekdays . Due to the pandemic , the number of passengers on the same carriage ( PSC ) of adults , children , students and senior citizens during weekdays ( weekends ) decreased by 34 . 5 % ( 47 . 8 % ) , 80 . 0 % ( 78 . 3 % ) , 72 . 9 % ( 70 . 3 % ) , and 30 . 2 % ( 42 . 9 % ) , respectively ( Fig . 3 ) . Dur - ing the rush hour of pandemic weekdays , the PSC of adults , children and students decreased by 32 . 6 % , 88 . 1 % and 81 . 4 % , respectively . Comparing with the weekdays , the PSC of adults , students , and senior citizens in pandemic ( non - pandemic ) weekends was decreased by 9 . 6 % ( 28 . 0 % ) , 22 . 9 % ( 15 . 4 % ) , and 11 . 1 % ( 27 . 3 % ) , respectively . However , children had 55 . 3 % ( 66 . 7 % ) more PSC during pandemic ( non - pandemic ) weekends than during weekdays . During the non - pandemic weekdays , there averagely were 94 adults , 5 children , and 10 students in a carriage . Compared with non - pandemic period , the reduction of PSC of senior citizens during the pandemic was the smallest . Due to the pandemic , number of passengers in the same carriage ( PSC ) was reduced during weekdays for all population groups , especially for children ( Fig . 4A ) . Adults , chil - dren , students , and senior citizens reduced PSC with children by 81 . 6 % , 90 . 3 % , 81 . 6 % and 78 . 9 % , respectively . Considering the proportion of each population group , passen - gers tended to have contacts with same - type passengers ( Fig . 4B ) . During pandemic weekdays , contacts between children and senior citizens increased significantly , while during pandemic weekends , adults had much more contacts with senior citizens . Compared with the rush hours before ( during ) the pandemic , the number of con - tacts between adults , children , students , senior citizens and adults in the same carriage decreased by 22 . 9 % ( 25 . 8 % ) , 21 . 1 % ( 26 . 8 % ) , 26 . 7 % ( 32 . 4 % ) and 21 . 4 % ( 24 . 5 % ) , respec - tively . The number of contacts between adults , students , senior citizens and children in the same carriage increased in weekends compared in weekdays . Compared to the week - end , the number of adults , students and senior citizens contacted with children in the same carriage in weekdays before ( during ) the pandemic increased by 87 . 7 % ( 105 . 4 % ) , 48 . 1 % ( 74 . 9 % ) and 81 . 0 % ( 79 . 3 % ) , respectively . However , the contacts between children in the same carriage decreased by 25 . 3 % due to school suspension . All population groups tended to contact with same - type passengers during both rush and non - rush hours . During the rush hours of the weekend , the contact between the four groups and senior citizens in the same carriage was significantly reduced , which indicate that senior citizens avoided unnecessary travel during rush hours during the pandemic . During the rush hours of the weekend before the pandemic , contacts between all population groups and students increased sharply comparing with it during the non - rush hours . The detailed distribution was shown in Figs . S8 and S9 . Travel reduction‑related interventions Based on the normal travel behaviors before the pandemic period , this section analyzed how interventions including work from home , school suspension , staggered shifts travel Page 9 of 18 Shang et al .

City and Built Environment ( 2023 ) 1 : 5 pattern and reduction on subway riding of different population group influence the interpersonal contacts in subways . Work from home and school suspension Work from home and school suspension can significantly reduce interpersonal contacts of adults , children and students ( Fig . S10 ) . Due to the work from home ( school suspen - sion ) , the number of passengers in the same carriage ( PSC ) of adults ( students / children ) during their rush hours decreased by 39 . 6 % ( 38 . 6 % / 43 . 2 % ) . Due to more passengers were adults , work from home in weekday can significantly reduce the PSC of all population groups in the rush hours . From Fig . 5 , when work from home , school suspension , and both work and school suspension were implemented , the FRC of adults during the rush hours ( 7 : 30 – 9 : 00 and 18 : 00 – 19 : 30 ) were reduced by 76 . 3 % , 2 . 9 % and 77 . 8 % , respectively , and the FRC of stu - dents ( children ) during the rush hours ( 7 : 00 – 8 : 00 and 15 : 30 – 16 : 30 ) was reduced by 8 . 7 % ( 4 . 6 % ) , 76 . 0 % ( 81 . 3 % ) and 79 . 5 % ( 82 . 6 % ) , respectively . If both work and school suspension were implemented , the FRC of adults , children , students and senior citizens would be decreased by 37 . 8 % , 50 . 2 % , 45 . 3 % and 11 . 8 % , respectively . If only work from home was implemented , the average FRC of adults , chil - dren , students and senior citizens would be decreased by 35 . 9 % , 8 . 2 % , 13 . 4 % and 9 . 8 % , respectively . If both work and school suspension were implemented , the daily number of passen - gers in the same train ( DPST ) of adults , children , students and senior citizens decreased by 21 . 4 % , 23 . 7 % , 23 . 0 % and 9 . 7 % , respectively , and children had the lowest DPST of 647 . The detailed distribution is shown in Fig . S11 . Staggered shifts travel pattern When the staggered shift travel patterns of workers , students , and children were imple - mented , the FRC of workers , students , and children during their rush hours were reduced by 73 . 3 % , 79 . 5 % , and 77 . 9 % , respectively ( Fig . 6A ) .

During the rush hours , the number of adults , children and students in the same carriage was 42 . 5 , 2 . 3 and 5 . 0 respectively ( Fig . 6B ) . Travel reduction of different population groups If the travel of adults was reduced by 90 % during the weekday ( weekend ) before the pandemic , the DPST would be decrease by 84 . 8 % ( 83 . 6 % ) for adults , 65 . 3 % ( 70 . 2 % ) for children , 68 . 6 % ( 70 . 1 % ) for students , and 69 . 5 % ( 70 . 1 % ) for senior citizens ( Fig . S12 ) . If the travel of children , students and senior citizens was reduced by 90 % , the DPST of children , students and senior citizens would be reduced by 42 . 5 % , 51 . 3 % and 48 . 0 % , respectively . Discussion The COVID - 19 has threatened almost all areas with people in the world , especially in large cities with high population density ( Chen et al . 2020 ) . Taking Hong Kong as an example , MTR is the main public transport . Local travel behaviors on subway was greatly affected by the COVID - 19 pandemic and changes on local travel behaviors also had a significant impact on the spread of COVID - 19 ( Megahed and Ghoneim 2020 ; Iacus et al . 2020 ) . Between January 1 , 2020 and January 31 , 2021 , Hong Kong had experi - enced four pandemic waves . Take MTR data during 2019 as control groups , approaching 4 billion valid card swiping data were collected to analyze the changes on local travel behaviors due to the pandemic . The impact of travel reduction - related interventions ( e . g . work from home , school suspension , staggered shift travel pattern , travel reduction ) on interpersonal contacts were simulated and analyzed . Due to the COVID - 19 pandemic , people reduced their travel significantly ( Jenelius and Cebecauer 2020 ) . International travels were banned in many countries due to the Fig . 6 Time - variant distribution with ( A ) frequency of possible repeated contacts on the same train ( FRC ) and ( B ) number of passengers in the same carriage ( PSC ) of adults , children , and students under staggered shift travel pattern Page 13 of 18 Shang et al . City and Built Environment ( 2023 ) 1 : 5 pandemic ( Sun et al . 2021 ) . Residents deliberately avoid to take public transports ( e . g . subway ) and turned to use private cars ( Chang et al . 2020 ) . COVID - 19 has affected peo - ple’s travel behavior in the MTR in Hong Kong severely . We found that , due to the pan - demic , Hong Kong adults , children , students and senior citizens reduced their subway riding by 37 . 2 % , 41 . 3 % , 43 . 4 % , and 33 . 5 % , respectively . Subway is one of the most impor - tant public transports ( Wu and Hong , 2017 ) , especially in Hong Kong . It is important to carry out an effective strategy on COVID - 19 prevention and control in subways ( Feng et al . 2020 ) . Most of passengers taking public transports were adults , especially during the rush hours . However , due to the short social distance , the infection risk via close contacts would be very high . During the serious pandemic , half of Europeans worked at home ( Galanti et al . 2021 ) , working from home has become a policy priority in many countries ( Vyas and Butakhieo 2021 ) . Therefore , the local government should take measures of work from home or off - peak commuting to reduce the infection risk on public trans - ports . Working from home for jobs that require attendance at work ( e . g . construction workers , healthcare , agriculture , and hospitality ) . The policy of working from home can be implemented for some occupations , but this will increase the danger of exposure if employees commute a significant distance ( Lo et al . 2011 ) . Work from home was usually taken by adults ( Dubey and Tripathi 2020 ) to avoid taking public transportation , and flexible working hours could also ensure the effective business operations ( Purwanto et al . 2020 ) . A fair allocation of adults who work from home can not only lower turno - ver rates , boost worker productivity ( Baker et al . 2007 ) , and ensure that the city’s daily operations run smoothly . Due to the weak awareness of personal protection and relative short social distance , children and students would tend to be infected ( Iachini et al . 2021 ) if all types of peo - ple had the same susceptibility . The Education Bureau will ensure the quality of distant learning ( Lau , EYH , Lee K 2021 ) , and children and students should implement man - datory school closure measures , which can considerably protect their safety . However , study showed that children and students have a higher resistance to COVID - 19 than adults and senior citizens ( Jing et al . 2020 ) , school suspension is not that effective as we expected . In addition , the number of subway travels of children was the smallest among all population groups , which means changes on children’s travel behavior influ - ence the pandemic least . However , school suspension has also been adopted in many areas to relieve the spread of the pandemic ( UNESCO 2020 ) . For other respiratory infec - tious diseases such as influenza , which is highly susceptible for children and students ( Smith et al . 2017 ) , school suspension would be very effective ( Kao et al . 2012 ) . School suspension reduced the average frequency of possible repeated contacts on the same train ( FRC ) of students and children during rush hours by 76 . 0 % and 81 . 3 % , respectively . Among four population groups , senior citizens showed the least changes on local travel behavior due to the pandemic , and still maintained a relatively high frequency of subway riding . However , many older people suffered from chronic diseases ( e . g . diabetes mellitus ) , which lead to lower resistance and more complications ( Dhama et al . 2020 ; Csiszar et al . 2020 ) . The susceptibility and mortality rate of COVID - 19 are 1 . 6 and 5 . 1 times of that of adults , respectively ( Jing et al . 2020 ; Lv et al . 2021 ) . We found that senior citizens had the longest daily exposure time in subways , which led to the greatest risk Page 14 of 18 Shang et al . City and Built Environment ( 2023 ) 1 : 5 of exposure in carriages ( Lo et al . 2021 ) . Unfortunately , the vaccination rate decreases with age ( Thanapluetiwong et al . 2021 ) . In Hong Kong , less than 20 % of older care home residents were fully vaccinated against COVID - 19 when Omicron came at the end of February 2022 ( Ma and Parry 2022 ) . The vaccination rate of people over 60 is only 62 % of that of adults ( Smith et al . 2022 ) . Hong Kong is a rapidly aging city ( Jayantha et al . 2018 ) , therefore , government should prioritize vaccination for senior citizens to reduce their susceptibility and mortality ( Monahan et al . 2020 ) . Moreover , it is important to strengthen the awareness of pandemic prevention and control for older people because most of their travel are unnecessary . In the rush hours of commuting workers ( 7 : 30 – 9 : 00 and 18 : 00 – 19 : 30 ) and students ( 7 : 00 – 8 : 00 and 15 : 30 – 16 : 30 ) , there were high FRC because large flow of passengers . Therefore , the government should implement measures that stagger peak travel , such as mandating adults commute at different times during the day ; Children and students go to and from school in various grades ( kindergarten , elementary school , junior high school and high school ) . We also found that the highest peak on FRC for both adults and children was between 20 : 30 and 21 : 00 during weekdays other than the morning and evening rush hours as we expected . The main reason may be that they usually go to shop - ping centers , entertainments , restaurants , and other places for non - essential activities during this period . Local governments should take relevant interventions such as closing shopping malls earlier and restricting population flow in public indoor environments , to reduce the close contacts during this period . Reducing repeated contacts among peo - ple in the social network can greatly reduce the transmission of the virus ( Block et al . 2020 ) . This study found that more than 99 % of passengers repeated contacts in the same train ( DRC ) were only once . But in the weekend before the pandemic , the DCR of adults reached a maximum of 15 . No matter what DRC is , in all population groups , adults have the highest frequency of contacts . Dispersing the commuting time of workers would be effective for repeated contact reduction ( Tirachini and Cats 2020 ) . In addition , increas - ing the departure frequency of subway trains can also reduce the density of passengers , thus reducing the infection risk . The infection risk of susceptible population increased significantly with the passen - ger flow , and the infection risk varies with time ( Li et al . 2022 ) . There was a negative correlation between COVID - 19 spread and social distance , while short social dis - tance would lead to ( Seong et al . 2021 ) . Moreover , high passenger volume was associ - ated with the higher infection rate of destinations ( e . g . bars , restaurants , and sport events ) ( Zhang et al . 2021b ) and the least deprived area ( Ha et al . 2022 ) . It not only promotes the spread of virus to other parts of the city but also may lead to an out - break in carriages ( Hamidi and Hamidi , 2021 ) . Governments should pay more atten - tion to crowded public destinations around the stations of public transports . During the pandemic weeks , the number of subway travels in weekdays was 0 . 3 times higher than that of weekends . However , it is difficult to keep long time on the target of “dynamic zero” ( dynamic zero means that preventive measures should be strengthened when cases appear . Under normal circumstances , moderate epidemic prevention measures with R t = 1 or slightly higher than 1 can be maintained ) during weekdays on public transports because of large number of necessary travels ( e . g . go to work / school ) . Children took subways more during weekends with most of travels to Page 15 of 18 Shang et al . City and Built Environment ( 2023 ) 1 : 5 entertainment areas . The local government should strengthen the Omicron preven - tion and control on hot subway lines or limit unnecessary travels . In order to achieve the requirement of “dynamic zero “ , R t needs to be controlled smaller than 1 ( Guo et al . 2022 ) . If the pandemic is difficult to be controlled in weekdays , the govern - ment can slightly reduce the prevention and control requirements during weekdays ( R t slightly higher than 1 ) and strictly control the pandemic on weekends ( R t < 1 ) to finally make the average R t of 1 during the whole week . This optimization method can effectively reduce the cost of the pandemic prevention and control . Several limitations were existed in the study . Firstly , four population groups were divided according to the types of smartcards , however , as the default card without any discount , adult’s cards may be used by other population groups . Secondly , the determination of each passenger’s route is based on the shortest path method , which assumes the same time spent between stations and neglects differences in routes chosen due to fares , personal habits , etc . Finally , the selected four pandemic weeks may be biased due to other factors , such as the intervention made by the local gov - ernment . In the future , real close contact behaviors of different types of passengers should be detected to analyze the infection risk via clos contact route in detail . More - over , the study on virus transmission could be extended from subway to other public transports such as bus and taxi . Conclusion Due to the pandemic , the total number of MTR passengers decreased by an average of 41 . 0 % , and the number of passengers on the same carriage of adults , children , stu - dents and senior citizens during weekdays ( weekends ) decreased by 34 . 5 % ( 47 . 8 % ) , 80 . 0 % ( 78 . 3 % ) , 72 . 9 % ( 70 . 3 % ) , and 30 . 2 % ( 42 . 9 % ) , respectively . During the rush hour of pandemic weekdays , the PSC of adults , children and students decreased by 32 . 6 % , 88 . 1 % and 81 . 4 % , respectively . Moreover , we found that work from home and stag - gered shift pattern of workers can reduce the infection risk effectively . However , school suspension is not that effective as we expected due to small number of chil - dren / students and relatively high resistance to COVID - 19 .
