Liposome , a high - efficiency vector , has been applied to deliver genetic materials into target cells for the treatment of various diseases (cid:15914) (cid:15914) accompanying with negative influences on cell membrane and cellular activities . However , its effects on the mechanical properties of transfected cells remain unrevealed . Atomic force microscope ( AFM ) has been used for cell morphology studies due to its high spatial resolution , no complex sample preparation , and wide imaging conditions . What’s more , AFM force measurement techniques can also be used to study the mechanical properties of cells . Therefore , AFM force measurement technology is an effective method to evaluate cellular response . In this study , AFM was used to investigate the morphology and mechanical properties of HEK293T cells in response to liposome at living cell level . After transformed with the transfection reagent lipofectamine 2000 , AFM data suggested a significant increase in roughness and adhesion force but an apparent decrease in Young’s modulus . Besides , MTT assay indicated that cells viability was reduced . All results combined to implied that liposome impacted the cell mechanical properties , impaired HEK293T cells . Keywords—liposome , transfection reagent , atomic force microscope , cell , morphology , mechanical property I . I NTRODUCTION Living cells possessing mechanical properties can respond to external physical and chemical stimuli by adjusting their own mechanical properties such as Young’s modulus , adhesion and hardness , and even produce mechanical forces [ 1 , 2 ] to regulate the corresponding physiological state , such as division [ 3 ] , migration [ 4 ] and contraction [ 5 ] . The study of mechanical properties of cells is a very promising research direction . By monitoring the changes of mechanical properties , the changes of cells in physiological or pathological processes can be inferred [ 5 - 11 ] . In recent decades , gene therapy has been considered to be a promising approach for treating several diseases owing to its prominent advantages [ 12 ] . The efficiency , and cytotoxicity of the transfection reagent , play vital roles in gene therapy for clinical applications . Liposome , a common transfection reagent , has been widely used in gene transfer therapy . Many studies stated that liposome has some side effect on various cell activities [ 13 - 15 ] . Nevertheless , the majority of the studies were based on molecular biology . The biomechanical and morphological influences of liposome on cell membrane are still unknown . The main means of measuring the mechanical properties of cells include magnetic twisting cytometry [ 16 - 18 ] , optical tweezer [ 19 - 21 ] , micropipette aspiration [ 22 , 23 ] and AFM . Optical tweezer and micropipette aspiration techniques are widely used to determine the overall mechanical behavior of a single suspended cell , which is not suitable for adherent cells . The magnetic twisting cytometry and AFM force measurement techniques are applied for the study of local mechanical properties of adherent cells , which provides more powerful technical support for the research of the subcellular mechanical properties . Because of the tedious operation and data processing of magnetic twisting cytometry , AFM is widely utilized to examine the cell physical properties . By scanning the sample with AFM probe , surface morphology information of the sample can be recorded , as well as the force - distance curve at any point of the sample can be obtained , and then the adhesion force and mechanical properties of the sample can be obtained . Because of its high resolution and in situ measurement of mechanical properties of single cells under near physiological conditions , AFM becomes an important tool for studying the response of cells to physical and chemical stimuli . In our work , AFM was used to collect topographical information of cell surface in aqueous environment . Then , the physical properties , such as roughness , adhesion force , and Young’s modulus of the cell membrane , were measured to evaluate to cell response to liposome . II . M ATERIALS AND M ETHODS A . Cell Culture and Transfection HEK293T cells were maintained in high - glucose Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium ( DMEM , Gibco , USA ) with 1 % Penicillin - Streptomycin ( P / S , Gibco , USA ) and 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS , Gibco , USA ) . Before seeding , the cells were cultured on flask . Then , cells were plated on a glass cover slip at 50 , 000 cells per well in a 6 - well plate . All the cells were incubated in a cell culture incubator ( Sanyo , Japan ) with 5 % CO 2 at 37 (cid:263) . After overnight incubation , cells were transiently transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , USA ) reagent . B . Cell Viablity Assay HEK293T cells were plated , with or without liposome , in a 96 - well plate and cultured for 24 h , at 37 o C . Then , 20 μL of MTT ( Sigma - Aldrich , America ) was added to each well for another 4 h incubating at 37 o C . The supernatant was gently but thoroughly removed and 150 μL DMSO was added . The 96 - wll plate was put on a shaker and vibrated for 5 to 10 min , and the value of OD at 492 nm was measure by the microplate spectrophotometer ( Epoch 2 , BioTek , USA ) .

Sample Preparation The cells were seeded and lipofectamine 2000 transfected at glass cover slips overnight . The cover slips were transferred to a culture dish with three times washing by phosphate buffered saline ( PBS , Gibco , USA ) . Then , DMEM was added into culture dish for live cell imaging and mechanical properties measurement . D . Morphological Characterization of HEK293T Cells The morphological information of cells with protein crystals were recorded by an optical microscope ( TI - S , NIKON , Japan ) , and an AFM ( NanoWizard @ 3 , JPK Instruments AG , Germany ) . The cells response to liposome , specifically from the perspective of mechanical properties , was also recorded by AFM . The probe used for imaging and measuring the mechanical properties was a MLCT probe ( Bruker , Germany ) with the tip radius of 20 nm , the normal spring constant of 0 . 03 N / m , and the resonance frequency of 22 kHz . III . R ESULTS AND D ISCUSSION After treated with liposome for 24 h , cells show different states . As shown in the optical image a , untreated cells with full polygon shape firmly attached to the plate . There are almost no dead cells floating in the medium . Considering Fig . 1 b , it is obvious that some cells died and suspended in the medium . Fig . 1 . Optical images of HEK293T cells : a , negative control , untreated healthy cells ( NC ) ; b . lipofectamine 2000 treated cells ( LP ) . To further explore the viability of the cells , we performed MTT assay . As the histogram presents in Fig . 2 , the viability of cells co - cultured with liposome is reduced by about 20 % . This data implies that the liposome causes certain damage to the cells . Fig . 2 . The cell viabilities of HEK293T cells . NC means negative control , without liposome ; LP represents cells treated by liposome . AFM imaging and force measuring were used to investigate the morphology and mechanical properties of living cells in response to the introduce of liposome . As shown in Fig . 2 a , untreated cells ( negative control , NC ) , about 12 . 2 μm high , full polygon shape , with a clear outline and smooth surface . Considering Fig . 2 b , it presents the results of cells treated by transfection reagent Lipofectamine 2000 ( LP ) . The cells become larger with a decrease in height . The membrane remains intact but rougher than NP cells . It suggests that liposome slightly damages the cell membrane while the cells remain physiologically active , which matches with the cell viability data . Fig . 3 .

(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:22) In order to furhter determine the changes in physical properties of living cells in response to transfection reagent , the roughness , adhension force , and Young’s modulus of cell membrane were measured by AFM . As shown in Fig . 4 , the adhesion force of cells of NC group is about 4 . 264 nN , and the value of LP group cells is distributed around 3 . 642 nN . Besides , the roughness of NC group cells is approximately 30 % lower than the cells treated by liposome . It means that native cells are smoother than treated cells . Liposome impairs the cell membrane , which is in agreement with the cell viability data . Fig . 4 . Adhesion and roughness of cells treated without ( NC ) or with ( LP ) liposome . To more specially evaluate the extent of damage , the Young’s modulus of cells treated without or with liposome was measured ( Fig . 5 ) . The Young’s modulus of untreated cells ( NC ) is 3 . 5 kPa . The Young’s modulus of cells treated with Lipofectamine 2000 ( LP ) is 2 . 8 kPa . This indicates that the stiffness of the cell membrane becomes weaker . Fig . 5 . Young’s modulus of cells treated without ( NC ) or with ( LP ) liposome . IV . C ONCLUSIONS In our work , AFM was used to collect topographical information of cell surface in aqueous environment . Then , the physical properties , such as roughness , adhesion force , and Young’s modulus of the cell membrane , were measured to evaluate to cell response to transfection reagent liposome . Interestingly , we found that liposome impaired the cell membrane , and induced tremendous changes in morphological and mechanical properties . Our study has yielded some valuable information . This will be of great benefit to further understanding cell activity and improving gene therapy .
