Glomerulosclerosis could be secondary to tubular injury , but it remains uncertain whether the CLCN5 gene , which encodes an endosomal chloride and / or hydrogen exchanger , plays a role in podocyte biology . Here , we implicate a role for CLCN5 in podocyte function and pathophysiology . Methods : Whole exome capture and sequencing of the proband and 5 maternally - related family members was conducted to identify X - linked mutations associated with biopsy - proven FSGS . Human podocyte cultures were used to characterize the mutant phenotype on podocyte function . Results : We identi ﬁ ed a novel mutation ( L521F ) in CLCN5 in 2 members of a Hispanic family who pre - sented with a histologic diagnosis of FSGS and low - molecular - weight proteinuria without hypercalciuria . Presence of CLCN5 was con ﬁ rmed in cultured human podocytes . Podocytes transfected with the wild - type or the mutant ( L521F ) CLCN5 constructs showed differential localization . CLCN5 knockdown in podocytes resulted in defective transferrin endocytosis and was associated with decreased cell proliferation and increased cell migration , which are hallmarks of podocyte injury . Conclusions : The CLCN5 mutation , which causes Dent ’ s disease , may be associated with FSGS without hyercalcuria and nepthrolithiasis . The present ﬁ ndings supported the hypothesis that CLCN5 participates in protein traf ﬁ cking in podocytes and plays a critical role in organizing the components of the podocyte slit diaphragm to help maintain normal cell physiology and a functional ﬁ ltration barrier . In addition to tubular dysfunction , mutations in CLCN5 may also lead to podocyte dysfunction , which results in a his - tologic picture of FSGS that may be a primary event and not a consequence of tubular damage .

D ent ’ s disease , an X - linked inherited disease , is characterized by proximal tubule dysfunction that leads to end - stage renal disease ( ESRD ) in more than two - thirds of affected males . Mutations in the CLCN5 gene are responsible for 50 % to 60 % of cases . 1 Close to 150 different CLCN5 mutations have been reported in patients with Dent ’ s disease . 2 – 4 The CLCN5 gene en - codes a chloride and / or proton exchanger that plays an important role in endosomal acidi ﬁ cation and receptor - mediated endocytosis . The protein has 18 a - helices ( A (cid:1) R ) . More than 40 % of mutations seen in Dent ’ s dis - ease have been found in O and P helices . 5 The clinical presentation of Dent ’ s disease may be deceptive , with a substantial number of patients Correspondence : Milos N .

On initial presentation , this high - grade proteinuria may be confused for nephrotic range proteinuria in patients with primary FSGS , when in fact , the underlying etiol - ogy is Dent ’ s disease ; therefore , careful clinical evalua - tion is essential . Although Dent ’ s disease is largely considered a tubular disease , 7 FSGS , or more commonly , focal global glomerulosclerosis ( FGGS ) , may be seen as a dominant feature in some patients with Dent ’ s disease . 7 , 8 In the kidney , CLCN5 is expressed in proximal tubules , thick ascending limbs , and a - intercalated cells of the collecting duct . 9 The protein functions as a 2 Cl (cid:1) / H þ exchanger and is involved in the acidi ﬁ cation of endo - somes , processing , and degradation of absorbed proteins , and megalin - dependent absorption of proteins . The expression of CLCN5 in glomerular cells has not been well - documented . Therefore , it is intriguing that the glomerular pathology is caused by a variant of a tubular protein . A key aspect of primary FSGS pathogenesis is podo - cyte damage and loss . 10 , 11 Mutations in genes that encode glomerular proteins , particularly in visceral epithelial cells ( podocytes ) , lead to the development of FSGS . 12 Previous reports have suggested that primary tubular injury may lead to glomerular sclerosis by mechanisms that are not yet understood . 13 , 14 In this study , we show that a variant of CLCN5 is present in a family with FSGS , and that CLCN5 is expressed in human podocytes and may play a role in glomerular physiology and pathology . Based on our results , we hypothesize that FSGS lesions , which are observed in patients with Dent ’ s disease , result from altered localization and / or function of CLCN5 in the podocytes , and are not purely a secondary consequence of tubular injury . This novel mutation has provided a unique opportunity to explore the mechanism by which the 2 Cl (cid:1) / H þ exchanger functions in podocytes . MATERIALS AND METHODS The study was approved by the Medical University of South Carolina ( MUSC ) Institutional Review Board , and signed informed consent was obtained from all study participants . Urine calcium was measured using Abbott Architect analyzer ( Abbott Park , IL ) at the MUSC central laboratory , and urine b 2 - microglobulin at the ARUP Laboratory ( Salt Lake City , Utah ) using a quantitative chemiluminescent immunoassay . Whole blood was collected from affected and unaffected family members in purple top ethylenediamine tetra - acetic acid tubes . Whole Exome Capture and High - Throughput Sequencing DNA was extracted from the blood of the individuals using standard protocols . The DNA was exome - enriched , followed by high - throughput sequencing . Enriched li - braries were prepared using Agilent ’ s ( Santa Clara , CA ) Sure Select XT Human All Exon V5 þ UTRs library kit for the Illumina platform ( Illumina , San Diego , CA ) . Adapters were ligated to sheared DNA followed by hybridization to baits for a 75 - Mb exome capture . Sequencing was performed on the captured exomes following the manu - facturer ’ s protocol using 125 bp paired - end sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq2500 , using version 4 reagents and software . Data for each sample was obtained to ensure an overall average of 100 (cid:3) coverage . Fastq ﬁ le output was used for downstream bioinformatics analysis . Bioinformatics Analysis of Whole Exome Sequencing Data ( Data Analysis and Statistical Justi ﬁ cation ) Paired - end ( 2 (cid:3) 125 bases ) DNA sequence reads that passed the Illumina quality control step were included in downstream analysis . Alignment and variant calling was performed using MiSeq Reporter Software version 2 . 4 ( MSR ) ( Illumina ) with GRCh37 Genome Reference Consortium Human Build 37 / HG19 as the reference genome . Variant analysis was performed with Var - iantStudio version 2 . 2 . 174 ( Illumina ) . Filtering of variant call ﬁ les ( vcf ) ﬁ les was carried out as follows : variants that passed the ﬁ lter that incorporated all variants types were examined . VariantStudio settings were as follows : quality was required to be > 100 , read depth was > 10 , and all population frequencies were < 5 % . X - linked was checked using the family - based ﬁ ltering option . Only variants mapped to a sin - gle site in all affected family members were selected for further analysis . Initial analysis focused on variants that were mapped to the X chromosome because the pedigree suggested an X linkage . Sequence variants that were homozygous in the 2 affected family mem - bers and heterozygous or absent in the 3 unaffected family members were identi ﬁ ed , as well as the allele frequency of each variant obtained from the dbSNP version 138 reference database . The dbSNP database was then used to assign the value of “ probable path - ogenic ” when appropriate . Those variants present in genes previously implicated in FSGS were selected for further study . Although the cohort we examined was small , the apparent X - linkage improved the chance to identify a pathologic variant . All phenotypic informa - tion and data from fastq and vcf were submitted to the National Center for Biotechnology Information database of genotypes and phenotypes ( accession number pending ) . TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH AK Solanki et al . : FSGS and Podocytes 1444 Kidney International Reports ( 2018 ) 3 , 1443 – 1453 In silico Functional Prediction of Mutations Functional prediction of the CLCN5 mutation was performed using the online in silico prediction software packages , PolyPhen - 2 ( http : / / genetics . bwh . harvard . edu / pph2 ) , SIFT ( http : / / sift . bii . a - star . edu . sg ) , and MutationTaster ( http : / / www . mutationtaster . org ) . Cell Culture and Histochemistry The pCMV6 - AC - GFP vector carrying the wild - type CLCN5 gene ( WT _ CLCN5 ) and L521F mutant pCMV6 - AC - GFP vector ( L521F _ CLCN5 ) were purchased from Origene ( Rockville , MD ) . Sequencing of a constructed vector containing the L521F mutation con ﬁ rmed the ve - racity of the mutation . Both cDNAs were in the frame so that each protein would be fused to green ﬂ uorescent protein ( GFP ) . HEK293 cells were purchased from ATCC . HK - 2 and HEK293 cells were grown in DMEM / F12 199 / EBSS medium ( Gibco , Life Technologies ) , respectively , until cells reached 70 % con ﬂ uence . Cells were transiently transfected with vectors using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection agent following the manufacturer ’ s in - structions . Twenty - four hours ( HEK293 cells ) or 48 hours ( HK - 2 cells ) later , images were taken using confocal mi - croscopy . Double staining for lysosome and CLCN5 pro - teins were done . In brief , cells were grown as described previously , and after transfection for 24 hours , they were incubated with Lysotracker deep red dye ( Life Technol - ogies , Cat . No . L12492 ) for 2 hours . Images of live cells were taken using immuno ﬂ uorescence microscopy ( Leica Microscope , DMI 4000B ) . The human podocyte cell line was cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute ( RPMI ) 1640 - based medium supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( Corning ) , insulin - transferrin - selenium ( ITS ) supplement ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , 200 U / ml penicillin , and streptomycin ( Roche Applied Science ) , as described previously . 15 Human kidney sections were obtained from the MUSC tissue bank . In brief , normal renal tissue was obtained from nephrectomy specimens and embedded in paraf ﬁ n . Five - micrometer sections were cut and processed . ShRNA - based Knockdown of CLCN5 Gene in Human Podocytes Cell Line To target CLCN5 , we screened Mission Lentiviral Transduction particle shRNAs in pLKO . 1 - puro ( CLCN5 MISSION shRNA - particle , commercially purchased from Sigma , catalog number SHCLNG - NM _ 000084 ; TRC number : TRCN0000043903 , TRCN0000043904 , TRCN0000043905 , TRCN0000043906 , TRCN0000043907 , TRCN000414058 , and TCRN000427059 ; each shRNA are designated as 903 , 904 , 905 , 906 , 907 , 058 , and 059 , respectively , in the present study ) . Transfection of the ShRNA plasmids into the human podocyte cell line was performed with Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) according to the manufacturer ’ s protocol . Transfected podocytes cells were grown in 2 . 5 m g / ml puromycin containing medium for the selection of stable transfectants and the CLCN5 knocked down was con ﬁ rmed by Western blot . Immunoblot Analysis Immunoblotting experiments were done as described previously . 15 A human podocyte cell line with CLCN5 knockdown was plated and allowed to grow at 33 (cid:4) C . The cells were harvested 48 hours later and rinsed twice with phosphate - buffered saline . Cell lysate was made using Radio immunoprecipitation assay buffer ( buffer / lysis buffer ) . The membrane was immunoblotted with antichloride channel CLC - 5 antibody produced in rabbits ( C1116 , Sigma - Aldrich ) , 1 : 500 dilution in TBST with 3 % bovine serum albumin ( Sigma Aldrich , St Louis , MO ) . To assure equivalent protein loading , the membranes were simultaneously incubated with glyceraldehyde - 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase mono - clonal antibody from Sigma ( 1 : 10 , 000 ) at 4 (cid:4) C overnight . Membranes were washed 3 times with TBST , incubated with horseradish peroxidase (cid:1) conjugated secondary antibodies ( Pierce ) at 1 : 10 , 000 dilutions for 1 hour at room temperature , and washed extensively before detection . The membranes were subsequently devel - oped using Super Signal West Femto Maximum Sensi - tivity Substrate ( Pierce , Cat . No . 34095 ) , and images were collected with a LICOR Image analyzer . Endocytosis Internalization assays using Transferrin from Human Serum , Alexa Fluorconjugated ( Molecular Probes , Cat . No . T23365 ) were performed as described 16 , 17 with some modi ﬁ cations . Citrate buffer ( pH : 2 . 5 ) was used to remove surface - bound transferrin . Images were collected at 10 , 15 , and 30 minutes postincubation us - ing a Leica confocal microscope ( TCS SP5 ) . For the analysis of transferrin uptake in cells where CLCN5 was knocked down , images of at least 50 surface - bound transferrin cells were collected for 2 clones and a cor - responding control . Cells that exhibited punctate transferrin labeling were counted as positive , and cells that did not contain distinct transferrin puncta were counted as negative . Migration and / or Wound Assay A migration assay was done as described previously with minor modi ﬁ cation . 18 , 19 Control and CLCN5 knockdown podocytes were grown in 35 - mm glass - bottom culture dishes ( MatTek Corporation ) until a con ﬂ uent cell monolayer was achieved . The cells were serum - starved in RPMI 1640 medium for 8 to 12 hours . A scratch wound was created using a 1 - to 10 - m l pipette AK Solanki et al . : FSGS and Podocytes TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH Kidney International Reports ( 2018 ) 3 , 1443 – 1453 1445 tip . Wounds were created with 2 strokes at a 90 - degree angle and washed twice with phosphate - buffered sa - line to remove all the suspended cells in the medium . The cells were then cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum , ITS sup - plement ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , and 200 U / ml penicillin and streptomycin ( Roche Applied Science ) at 33 (cid:4) C for 12 hours . Images were taken at different time points ( 0 , 6 , and 10 hours ) . The experiment was performed 3 times , and the rate of migration was calculated using ImageJ software . Cell Proliferation Assay An equal number ( 50 , 000 cells ) of control and CLCN5 knockdown podocytes were plated and allowed to grow for 24 , 48 , or 72 hours . To measure the difference in the rate of proliferation , the cells were trypsinized , and cells in suspension were counted using a hemo - cytometer . The number of cells at different time points was plotted , and differences between the control and CLCN5 knockdown clones were calculated . Immuno ﬂ uorescence Microscopy Cultured podocytes were grown on coverslips as described previously . 20 Each experiment was carried out in 3 independent sets , and the images were collected using a Leica immuno ﬂ uorescence Microscope ( Lieca DMI 400B ) . Statistical Analysis Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad PRISM 7 . 01 software . Distribution of cell wound closure data normality was tested through the D ’ Ag - ostino and Pearson normality test and passed this test , whereas the Shapiro - Wilk normality test showed all the data used for the cell proliferation analysis had a normal distribution . Statistical signi ﬁ cance was deter - mined by 2 - way analysis of variance , and P values were adjusted using Tukey ’ s multiple comparison . P values < 0 . 05 was considered statistically signi ﬁ cant . Mean ﬂ uorescence intensity was measured by immu - no ﬂ uorescence images using ImageJ software ( National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , MD ) , and > 50 images were used from 3 different experiments . Mean pixel intensity differences between control and CLCN5 knockdown podocytes were analyzed through the nonparametric Mann - Whitney test , and P < 0 . 05 was considered statistically signi ﬁ cant . RESULTS Pedigree Analysis and Whole Exome Sequencing The proband , a 37 - year - old Hispanic man , was evalu - ated by a local nephrologist in Guadalajara , Mexico for proteinuria and an increase in serum creatinine . Based on the kidney biopsy ( Figure 1a ) , he was diagnosed with FSGS in 2012 . Two years later , in January 2014 , he presented to our hospital for kidney transplantation . During a donor evaluation at that time , it was revealed that his 32 - year - old brother had similar symptoms , and based on a kidney biopsy ( Figure 1b ) was also diag - nosed with FSGS . Based on a survey of both affected brothers , we created a pedigree and identi ﬁ ed 9 family members in total who had kidney disease . The pedigree presented in Figure 1c is suggestive of an X - linked mode of inheritance . We obtained whole blood and performed whole exome sequencing in 6 individuals : the proband , 1 affected brother , 1 nonaffected brother , an affected uncle , and the proband ’ s nonaffected mother and sister . Urine was obtained from the pro - band ’ s sister , mother , clinically nonaffected brother , and affected brother , who did not yet have ESRD . Total calcium and b 2 microglobulin excretion values are presented in Table 1 . The excretion of b 2 micro - globulin ( corrected for urine creatinine ) was > 2000 times greater for the affected brother compared with the nonaffected brother and sister ; whereas in the unaffected carrier mother , b 2 microglobulin excretion ( corrected for creatinine ) was only approximately 64 times greater . Whole exome sequencing identi ﬁ ed 6 gene variants in 5 genes on the X chromosome in the proband : CLCN5 ( NM _ 001127898 . 1 : c . 1771C > T ) , HDX ( NM _ 144657 . 4 : c . 1190T > C ) , KIAA2022 ( 2 variants : NM _ 001008537 . 2 : c . 3001G > C , NM _ 001008537 . 2 : c . 2851G > A ) , SLC16A2 ( NM _ 006517 . 4 : c . 538G > A ) , and SSX5 ( NM _ 021015 . 3 : c . 337C > T ) . Of the 6 candidate gene variants , only 1 was present in all affected members , which demonstrated heterozygosity in the proband ’ s mother and sister ( i . e . , only 1 X chromosome affected ) , and was not present in the nonaffected brother . Based on this rationale , the most likely candidate responsible for the development of FSGS in this family was the mutation found in the CLCN5 gene . The mutation involves replacement of phenylalanine for leucine at position 521 ( L / F521 , CLCN5 variant 3 NM _ 000084 . 4 ) in the shorter variant or position 591 ( L / F591 , CLCN5 variant 1 NM _ 001127899 . 3 ) in the longer variant . In silico Prediction of the Effect of Amino Acid Change on CLCN5 Polyphen - 2 , SIFT , and MutationTaster servers were used to predict the effect of mutation L521F on the CLCN5 gene . Based on the output obtained using server Polyphen - 2 , the mutation was predicted to be damaging , with a score of 0 . 884 ( sensitivity : 0 . 82 ; speci ﬁ city : 0 . 94 ) . Interestingly , using the server SIFT , substitution at position 521 from L to F was predicted TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH AK Solanki et al . : FSGS and Podocytes 1446 Kidney International Reports ( 2018 ) 3 , 1443 – 1453 to be intolerant , and could have affected protein function , with a score of 0 . 04 . The MutationTaster server also predicted that the mutation would affect protein physiology , leading to a disease phenotype . Cellular Localization of Wild - type and Mutant CLCN5 - L521F Proteins To further analyze if the L521F mutation resulted in defective cellular localization of CLCN5 protein , we overexpressed these genes in cultured HEK and HK - 2 cells . Cells were transiently transfected with the pCMV6 - AC - GFP vector carrying wild - type CLCN5 cDNA ( WT _ CLCN5 ) and the L521F mutant pCMV6 - AC - GFP vector ( L521F _ CLCN5 ) . As seen in Figure 2a ( left panel ) , HEK cells transfected with WT _ CLCN5 showed signi ﬁ cant localization of CLCN5 protein at the cell membrane . In contrast , HEK cells transfected with L521F _ CLCN5 showed expression of the mutant L521F CLCN5 protein primarily in the cytoplasm ( Figure 2a , right panel ) . Similar ﬁ ndings were noted in the HK - 2 transfected cells , as demonstrated in Figure 2b ( left and right panels for the wild - type CLCN5 and L521F mutant , respectively ) . Figure 1 . Identi ﬁ cation of patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis ( FSGS ) and pedigree analysis . We identi ﬁ ed 2 brothers , the proband ( a ) and the affected brother ( b ) who presented to a local nephrologist , in Mexico , with proteinuria and altered renal function . The silver - stained biopsy image shows a segmentally sclerotic glomerulus . Other areas of the glomeruli appear relatively normal . Both were diagnosed with FSGS based on kidney biopsies presented here . Pedigree of the family with X - linked inheritance of FSGS ( c ) . The red arrow indicates the proband . Blood was collected from the proband and 5 additional family members indicated by asterisks . The pedigree suggested an X - linked pattern of inheritance .

Small differences in spot urine creatinine are because the b 2 - MG assays were performed at the ARUP Laboratory and the calcium assay at the MUSC Laboratory . AK Solanki et al . : FSGS and Podocytes TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH Kidney International Reports ( 2018 ) 3 , 1443 – 1453 1447 To further investigate if L521F CLCN5 was entrapped in lysosomal structures , we used a lysosome - speci ﬁ c stain , Lysotracker deep red . Figure 2c shows colocalization of GFP - labeled CLCN5 protein ( green ) with the lysosomal - speci ﬁ c marker ( red ) . As demonstrated in Figure 2c , compared with the wild - type CLCN5 protein ( left panel ) , the mutant L521F CLCN5 protein showed increased co - localization with lysosomes ( right panel ) . These ﬁ ndings were consistent with previous reports that showed that the CLCN5 ( L521F ) mutation resulted in the formation of a defective protein that was aber - rantly processed and transferred to lysosomes for degradation . Identi ﬁ cation of CLCN5 Protein in Cultured Human Podocytes and Kidney Sections A single laboratory group demonstrated that CLCN5 is expressed in glomerular podocytes , in which CLCN5 belongs to a complex of proteins involved in albumin reabsorption in the podocytes 21 , 22 ; however , these data have not been independently veri ﬁ ed , and the effect of CLCN5 mutations in podocytes have not been studied . Figure 3a shows a Western blot of homogenized human cultured podocyte lysate probed with an anti - CLCN5 antibody . We identi ﬁ ed a single band corresponding to the approximate molecular weight of 80 kDa , which most likely represented the shorter , 746 amino acid CLCN5 proteoform . Immuno ﬂ uorescence studies pre - sented in Figure 3b further supported the Western blot ﬁ ndings and demonstrated the expression of endoge - nous CLCN5 in human cultured podocytes . We further tested glomerular expression in sections of normal mouse and human kidney , and found signi ﬁ cant expression of the CLCN5 protein in mice kidney glomeruli and parietal epithelial cells . Cellular Localization of Wild - type and L521F Mutant CLCN5 Protein in Cultured Human Podocytes A cultured human podocyte cell line was transfected with wild - type CLCN5 ( WT _ CLCN5 ) and mutant CLCN5 ( L521F _ CLCN5 ) constructs . As demonstrated in Figure 3c , cells transfected with a GFP - tagged , wild - type construct demonstrated both cytoplasmic and cell surface distribution of the protein ; in contrast , the cultured human podocytes transfected with GFP - tag - ged L521F CLCN5 demonstrated predominantly intra - cellular distribution . Importantly , the results obtained with human podocytes were similar to the observations noted in the transfected human renal proximal tubule cells . Effect of Knockdown of CLCN5 Expression on Cell Proliferation (cid:1) Cell Migration in Podocyte Cells To further examine the involvement of CLCN5 in traf ﬁ cking mechanisms in podocytes , especially in endocytosis , we generated a stable human podocyte cell line in which the CLCN5 gene was knocked down using the CLCN5 speci ﬁ c shRNA . The CLCN5 knock - down in podocyte cell lines was con ﬁ rmed by immu - noblotting ( Figure 4a , upper panel ) . The cell proliferation assay ( Figure 4a , lower panel ) showed a reduced rate of proliferation in the CLCN5 knockdown human podocytes compared with the control podo - cytes . Interestingly , the rate of cell migration , as assessed by a scratch assay , in CLCN5 knockdown cells was increased compared with the control podocyte Figure 2 .

TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH AK Solanki et al . : FSGS and Podocytes 1448 Kidney International Reports ( 2018 ) 3 , 1443 – 1453 cells ( Figure 4b ) . The increased rate of cell migration was reported as abnormal and was a sign of podocytes injury . Endocytosis CLCN5 was shown to play a role in the uptake of low - molecular - mass proteins through receptor - mediated endocytosis in proximal tubules . 23 It was also re - ported that CLCN5 channel disruption impaired endo - cytosis in a mouse model for Dent ’ s disease . 24 To examine whether CLCN5 was involved in endocytosis in human podocytes , we monitored uptake of trans - ferrin ( Alexa Fluor conjugated ) in CLCN5 knockdown human podocyte cells . As shown in Figure 4c ( left and right panels ) and Figure 4d , the ﬂ uorescence intensity of endocytosed transferrin was much higher in wild - type human podocytes compared with the CLCN5 knockdown cells after 10 , 20 , and 30 minutes of incubation . These results suggested that CLCN5 played a key role in traf ﬁ cking mechanisms in podocytes . DISCUSSION In this study , we identi ﬁ ed and characterized a novel mutation in the CLCN5 gene found in a Hispanic family whose 2 members presented with overt proteinuria and were diagnosed with FSGS . None of the family mem - bers were aware of or had classical features of Dent ’ s disease ( e . g . , nephrocalcinosis , nephrolithiasis , rickets , and hypercalciuria ) . Proteinuria on the initial evalua - tion was not characterized as consisting of only low - molecular - weight proteins . According to the literature , 3 , 7 , 25 erroneous diagnosis and treatment of presumptive FSGS is not a rare event because a considerable number of patients with Dent ’ s disease , like those in our study , have an oligosymptomatic phenotype .

The mutation described resulted in the replacement of leucine with phenylalanine at position 521 ( short variant , Uniprot accession number P51795 - 1 ) or posi - tion 591 ( long variant , Uniprot accession number P51795 - 2 ) . Based on our ﬁ ndings , we postulated that this mutation had pathogenic signi ﬁ cance . First , the mutation on this speci ﬁ c site , which involved replacement of leucine with arginine ( L521R ) , was previously reported in a pediatric patient with Dent ’ s disease , 26 but there were no studies with respect to the consequence of CLCN5 mutations on the function of human podocytes that might underlie the observed glomerular involvement . Second , the experimental replacement of leucine with arginine at position 521 resulted in defective traf ﬁ cking to the surface of Xen - opus oocytes compared with wild - type CLCN5 , which suggested mutations at this site could impair localiza - tion to the plasma membrane . 27 Third , the mutation was located in the P helix of the CLCN5 protein , a re - gion that is highly conserved across the members of the CLCN family . 5 The CLCN5 exchanger functions as a homodimer , and integrity of the P helix is essential for homodimer formation . 28 Our results were consistent with the previous report , which found that mutations at the leucine 521 position resulted in improper traf ﬁ cking of the mutant protein and might be directed to lysosomes for degradation as observed 10 Min 20 Min 30 Min 0 10 20 30 40 M ean P i x e l I n t en s i t y ( A U ) ControlCLCN 5 KD P < 0 . 0001 P < 0 . 0001 P < 0 . 0001 6 Hours 10 Hours 0 100 200 300 W ound C l o s u r e ( % ) ControlCLCN5 clone 903 CLCN5 clone 904 P = 0 . 002 P = 0 . 05 P < 0 . 001 P = 0 . 02 d a b c Figure 4 . shRNA - based knockdown of CLCN5 in human podocytes .

TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH AK Solanki et al . : FSGS and Podocytes 1450 Kidney International Reports ( 2018 ) 3 , 1443 – 1453 from the Lysotracker staining experiments in our study ( Figure 2c ) . The lesions of FSGS and FGGS have increasingly been reported in patients with Dent ’ s disease . In the most extensive study published so far , which involved 30 kidney biopsies , FGGS was found in 83 . 3 % of cases , FSGS in 6 . 6 % , and segmental capillary collapse in 6 . 6 % of cases . Segmental foot process effacement was found in all cases , but was analyzed in less than one - half of biopsy samples . 29 The appearance of glomerulosclerosis in a patient with Dent ’ s disease has generally been regarded as a consequence of tubular damage ; howev - er , no plausible mechanism has been proposed . 2 , 3 , 26 Based on data presented within this study , we postu - lated that a mutation in CLCN5 could lead to glomer - ulosclerosis , in part , through primary podocyte injury . To evaluate the role of CLCN5 in podocyte damage , we ﬁ rst demonstrated that CLCN5 was expressed in cultured human podocytes both by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry . The physiological role of CLCN5 in podocytes was not previously investigated , although its expression was shown in podocytes . 22 Evidence suggested that similar to proximal tubular cells , endocytic mechanisms operate in podocytes and play an important role in the maintenance of the glomerular ﬁ ltration barrier . 30 Furthermore , it appeared that glomerular expression of CLCN5 was increased in some proteinuric patients . 21 Our experiments demonstrated that the identi ﬁ ed human mutation ( L521F ) led to altered subcellular localization of the CLCN5 protein in podocytes in the same manner described for cultured human proximal tubular cells . 31 It was thus conceivable that CLCN5 might have a similar role in podocytes as in proximal tubular cells . Data from immortalized proximal tu - bule cell lines derived from patients with Dent ’ s disease indicated that similar abnormalities resulting from CLCN5 mutations might be derived through differing cellular phenotypes affecting either endo - somal acidi ﬁ cation and / or receptor - mediated endocy - tosis . 31 We demonstrated impaired endocytosis in cultured podocytes with genetic knockdown of CLCN5 genes . Previous studies demonstrated that in response to direct cell injury , cultured podocytes changed from limited motility to enhanced motility and loss of stress ﬁ bers . 18 Upon insult , stationary podocytes upregulated cytosolic cathepsin L expression and activity , and developed motile podocyte foot processes . This migratory response led to foot processes effacement , slit diaphragm remodeling , and proteinuria . 31 – 33 This observation suggested that stress - induced podocyte motility associated with actin dynamics resulted in dysfunction of slit molecules and the integrin network . We demonstrated that deletion of the CLCN5 gene in cultured podocytes resulted in increased cell migration , which is an established phenotype of injured podo - cytes . These data , together with our ﬁ nding of impaired endocytosis , suggested that the presence of CLCN5 is necessary for proper podocyte function . Recognition of the crucial role of CLCN5 in podocyte protein traf ﬁ cking holds promise for the identi ﬁ cation of important molecular events that regulate podocyte injury . Collectively , the results presented in this study suggested that CLCN5 is expressed in podocytes and plays a critical role in podocyte function by partici - pating in protein endocytosis . We provided some evi - dence that FSGS or FGGS observed in Dent ’ s disease might be the result of primary podocyte injury inde - pendent of tubular injury . However , at this time , we cannot conclude that the mutation presented here has pathological consequences for podocytes . The concept that a condition , which has historically been consid - ered primarily tubular in origin , can lead to FSGS does not appear to be limited to CLCN5 mutations . Recently , lesions of FSGS were seen in patients with a mutation in the TTC21B gene , which encodes a ciliary protein and causes nephronophthisis , a classical tubular disease . Similar to CLCN5 , the expression of TTC21B was detected in podocytes . 34 , 35 The probability that Dent ’ s disease is also a podocyte disease raises intriguing questions regarding the use of angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers for individuals with this condition . The use of enalapril and candesartan were reported in isolated case reports of Dent ’ s disease , 2 , 36 but never tested systematically . Based on our observations , we believe placebo - controlled trials using angiotensin antagonists would be highly recommended to assess their impact on the progression of Dent ’ s disease . In addition , CLCN5 knockout mice that replicate Dent ’ s disease have been generated and may serve as a useful animal model to assess the effect of angiotensin blockade on disease progression . For physicians treating patients with a pathological diagnosis of FSGS and proteinuria , it is of utmost importance to make sure that low - molecular - weight proteinuria and Dent ’ s disease are excluded before subjecting patients to toxic immunosuppressive treat - ment , because Dent ’ s disease with glomerular involvement is no longer considered a rare event . 3 , 7 , 25 DISCLOSURE All the authors declared no competing interests .
