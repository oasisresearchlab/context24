Newly formed synapses promote branch initiation and stability . However , little is known about molecular mechanisms that link these two processes . Here , we show that local assembly of an F - actin cytoskeleton at nascent pre - synaptic sites initiates both synapse formation and axon branching . We further ﬁnd that assembly of the F - actin network requires a direct interaction between the synaptic cell adhesion molecule SYG - 1 and a key regulator of actin cytoskeleton , the WVE - 1 / WAVE regulatory complex ( WRC ) . SYG - 1 cyto - plasmic tail binds to the WRC using a consensus WRC interacting receptor sequence ( WIRS ) . WRC mutants or mutating the SYG - 1 WIRS motif leads to loss of local F - actin , synaptic material , and axonal branches . Together , these data suggest that syn - aptic adhesion molecules , which serve as a neces - sary component for both synaptogenesis and axonal branch formation , directly regulate subcellular actin cytoskeletal organization . INTRODUCTION Nervous system function is dependent on the intricate network of connections formed between neurons . Axons often adopt a branched morphology in their target area with axonal arbors decorated by synapses . Based on electron microscopy obser - vations that synapses are often present at branch points , Vaughn ( 1989 ) hypothesized that synapse formation might promote the elaboration of axonal and dendritic branches ( Cline and Haas , 2008 ; Vaughn , 1989 ) . Consistent with this idea , in vivo imaging of developing retinal ganglion cell ( RGC ) showed that synapse formation and axonal arbor formation occur simultaneously during development . New axonal branches initiate from synapses , and branches with synapses are more stable than synapse - free branches ( Meyer and Smith , 2006 ) . These observations point to molecular mechanisms that link synapse formation and branching . Although little is known about such links , the mechanisms of presynapse formation and axonal branch formation have been studied extensively . De novo branches that form from the main axon shaft are termed collateral axonal branches . Formation of collateral branches requires cytoskeletal organization at branch sites . Often , actin assembly initiates ﬁlopodia or lamellipodia formation followed by microtubule invasion , which marks the maturation of the collateral branch ( Gallo , 2011 ) . The importance of F - actin during synapse formation has been shown by studies in which depolymerizing F - actin during a critical developmental time window causes synapse loss ( Zhang and Benson , 2001 ) . As actin is ubiquitous , it is not surprising that F - actin plays many roles during synaptogenesis . F - actin can interact with presynaptic active zone proteins and affect the recruitment of active zone components to synapses ( Chia et al . , 2012 ; Zhang and Benson , 2001 ) . Conversely , active zone proteins may regulate F - actin organization at synapses . For example , the vertebrate active zone protein Piccolo can bind actin regulator proﬁlin ( Waites et al . , 2011 ) . Similarly , in Dros - ophila , a perisynaptic SH3 adaptor protein , Nervous Wreck , con - trols synapse morphology by binding to Wasp , a key regulator of F - actin dynamics ( Coyle et al . , 2004 ) . Presynaptic F - actin may alsoberequiredforclusteringsynapticvesiclesaroundtheactive zone ( Doussau and Augustine , 2000 ; Murthy and De Camilli , 2003 ) . Recent studies have linked various transmembrane cell adhesion molecules that facilitate recognition and interaction of pre - and postsynaptic membranes to intracellular F - actin rearrangements at synapses . These include the ﬂy immunoglob - ulin superfamily protein Basigin ( Besse et al . , 2007 ) , UNC - 40 / DCC ( Stavoe et al . , 2012 ) , SYG - 1 / NEPH1 ( Chia et al . , 2012 ) , Ten - uerins ( Mosca et al . , 2012 ) , and cadherins ( Sun and Bamji , 2011 ) . Like synapse assembly , the formation of collateral axonal branches relies heavily on F - actin dynamics ( Gallo , 2011 ) . Treat - ing cortical neurons in vitro with Latrunculin , a drug that inhibits F - actin dynamics , resulted in a loss of axon branching but did not affect the elongation of the core axon shaft ( Dent and Kalil , 2001 ) . The actin nucleation factor , Arp2 / 3 complex , has also been shown to be required for branch formation in embryonic chicken dorsal root ganglia neurons ( Spillane et al . , 2011 ) . Knocking down Ena / VASP , another F - actin nucleation factor , drastically affected branching of RGC axons in Xenopus ( Dwivedy et al . , 2007 ) . Although the phenomenon of synapse - directed arborization has been observed , few studies have explored pathways that 208 Cell 156 , 208 – 220 , January 16 , 2014 ª 2014 Elsevier Inc . mechanistically link axon arbor growth and synaptogenesis . Here , we demonstrate that the transmembrane cell adhesion molecule SYG - 1 / NEPH1 can recruit the WASP family verprolin - homologous protein ( WVE - 1 / WAVE ) regulatory complex ( WRC ) , a well - known activator of the Arp2 / 3 complex , to nascent synapses . This interaction is mediated by a conserved amino acid sequence , the WRC interacting receptor sequence ( WIRS ) , in the cytoplasmic tail of SYG - 1 . This SYG - 1 / WRC inter - action controls the assembly of an Arp2 / 3 - mediated F - actin patch that localizes to developing synapses and is required for both downstream axonal arborization and synapse assembly . Hence , our data support the synaptotropic model by identifying a common downstream modulator shared by both processes and is recruited to nascent synapses by synaptic cell adhesion receptors . RESULTS Local Assembly of F - actin by SYG - 1 / SYG - 2 Interaction Is Required for Presynaptic Assembly and Branch Formation To investigate the processes that coordinate synapse formation and collateral axon branch formation in vivo , we studied the C . elegans egg - laying motorneurons HSN . The cell bodies of HSN are located posterior to the vulva , and each extends an axon anteriorly into the nerve ring . As the axon extends past the vulva , HSN forms clusters of en passant synapses onto the vulva muscles ( Figure 1A ) . At the synaptic region , HSN also elaborates one or two stereotyped axonal branches dorsally . To understand the temporal relationship between synaptogene - sis and branch formation during development , we expressed both a synaptic vesicle marker , mCherry : : RAB - 3 , and a plasma membrane marker , myristolated GFP , in HSN using cell - speciﬁc promoters to track the development of the HSN neuron ( Figures 1B – 1F ) . In the late L3 stage , the HSN axon grows across the developing vulva from posterior to anterior with no detectable RAB - 3 clusters and no axonal branches ( Figure 1B ) . In early L4 animals , the axon growth cone continues to extend anteriorly toward the nerve ring , and RAB - 3 clusters begin to accumulate at the vulva region ( Figure 1C ) . Other synaptic markers such as SNB - 1 / synaptobrevin ( Shen and Bargmann , 2003 ) ( Figure 1O ) and active zone markers , including SYD - 2 / liprin - a ( data not shown ) , also accumulate , suggesting that bona ﬁde presynaptic terminals form at this stage . Interestingly , no axonal branches are visible at this stage . During the mid - L4 to adult stage , the intensity of the RAB - 3 clusters increases . In the meantime , branches form along the synaptic region , which increase in length into the adult stage ( Figures 1D – 1F ) . These observations suggest that the onset of synaptogenesis , signiﬁed by the clus - tering of synaptic vesicles and active zones proteins in the synaptic region , precedes axonal collateral branch formation . Our previous work showed that a pair of immunoglobulin synaptic adhesion molecules , SYG - 1 and SYG - 2 , specify the location of HSN synapses . SYG - 2 is expressed in the primary epithelial cells located immediately dorsal to the HSN axon , which expresses SYG - 1 . SYG - 2 binds and localizes SYG - 1 to specify the HSN synaptic region ( Shen and Bargmann , 2003 ; Shen et al . , 2004 ) . To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying branch formation , we examined syg - 1 and syg - 2 loss - of - function mutants and found that about 80 % of the mutants have no branch , whereas only 16 % of wild - type ( WT ) animals lack branches ( Figures 1G – 1K ) . This result suggests that SYG - 1 and SYG - 2 are not only required for assembling synapses but are also critical for branch formation . To further address whether the SYG - 1 / SYG - 2 interaction is sufﬁcient to trigger branch formation , we ectopically expressed SYG - 2 in the secondary vulva epithelial cells , which localizes to the ventral side of HSN axon ( Figure 1L ) in a syg - 2 mutant . This has previ - ously been shown to induce ectopic synapse formation due to speciﬁc recruitment of SYG - 1 to ectopic SYG - 2 - expressing sites ( Shen et al . , 2004 ) . We found that this manipulation is sufﬁcient to induce ventrally directed branches that are not found in WT animals ( Figures 1M and 1N ) . Taken together , these data argue that the SYG - 1 / SYG - 2 interaction instructs both synapse forma - tion and axon branch formation . There are two possible mechanisms that can produce tight spatial and temporal correlation between synaptogenesis and branch formation . First , local accumulation of presynaptic mate - rial by the SYG - 1 / SYG - 2 interaction might directly induce branch formation . This hypothesis is also supported by the loss of synapses from the HSN synaptic region in syg - 1 mutants ( Fig - ures 1O and 1P ) . Alternatively , synaptogenesis and branch for - mation might be parallel events that are initiated by the SYG - 1 / SYG - 2 interaction . To distinguish between these possibilities , we examined branch formation in unc - 104 and syd - 2 mutants to understand whether loss of synaptic material might affect branching . The motor protein UNC - 104 / kinesin - 3 is required to transport synaptic vesicles , but not active zone proteins , to pre - synaptic terminals in HSN ( Patel et al . , 2006 ) . Loss of UNC - 104 results in synaptic vesicles becoming completely trapped in the HSN cell body ( Figure 2A ) . However , unc - 104 mutants dis - played only a subtle branching phenotype ( Figures 2B and 2C ) . Similarly , loss of syd - 2 prevents recruitment of synaptic vesicles and most active zone proteins to synapses ( Figure 2D ) ( Patel et al . , 2006 ) . Despite these defects , syd - 2 mutants still show normal branching ( Figure 2E ) . These data suggest that neither synaptic vesicles nor active zone proteins are essential for branch formation . Therefore , the data suggest that synapse for - mation and axonal branching may be initiated by the SYG - 1 / SYG - 2 interaction in parallel . We next asked how the SYG - 1 / SYG - 2 interaction might initiate the two processes . We previously showed that SYG - 1 is not only required to initiate synapse assembly but is also required to pattern an F - actin network at the HSN synaptic region during development ( Chia et al . , 2012 ) . This local F - actin is crucial for presynaptic assembly . In syg - 1 mutants , F - actin , which is labeled by GFP fused to the calponin homology domain of F - actin binding protein utrophin ( GFP : : utCH ) , is no longer enriched at the synaptic region ( Fig - ures 2F and 2G ) . On the contrary , the F - actin patch is unper - turbed in either unc - 104 or syd - 2 mutants ( Figures 2H and 2I ) ( Chia et al . , 2012 ) , suggesting that F - actin assembly is an upstream event of the local accumulation of synaptic vesicles and active zone proteins . Thus , the F - actin network might be important for initiating both synapse assembly and axon branching .

To test whether the F - actin network is required for HSN branching , we injected Latrunculin A , a drug that disrupts F - actin organization , locally into the vulva region . We had previously shown that this treatment disrupts F - actin at synapses in HSN ( Chia et al . , 2012 ) . We observed a slight but signiﬁcant decrease in branching in animals injected with Latrunculin A as compared Figure 1 .

Taken together , loss of the local F - actin , but not synaptic material , affects axonal branching , Furthermore , these results hint that synapse formation and axon branching are parallel events but are spatially linked by the F - actin structure down - stream of SYG - 1 . In the vertebrate system , F - actin has been shown to be important for both synapse assembly , as well as axon arborization ( Gallo , 2011 ) . WRC Is Required for Assembling an Arp2 / 3 - Mediated Actin Network at Synapses To further dissect the molecular pathway involved in establishing this F - actin network , we ﬁrst sought to understand the nature of the F - actin at HSN synapses . Cells can generate a diverse array of F - actin networks that differ in geometry , mechanics , and dynamics for various cellular functions . These F - actin structures bind and interact with different subsets of proteins that can also be used to label F - actin in vivo . When expressed in HSN , GFP : : utCH distinctively labels F - actin enriched at the synaptic region labeled by mCherry : : RAB - 3 ( Figure 3A ) . This localization is unlike another well - established in vivo F - actin probe , the actin - binding domain of moesin ( GFP : : moesinABD ) , which labels the entire HSN axon with no obvious enrichment at the synaptic region , similar to a cell morphology marker , cyto - plasmic mCherry ( Figure 3B ) . This suggests that GFP : : utCH may bind to a speciﬁc subpopulation of F - actin that is found locally at synapses . To identify the speciﬁc F - actin structure to which utCH binds , we expressed both GFP : : moesinABD and GFP : : utCH in Saccharomyces cerevisiae . Three distinct actin networks are known to assemble in yeast : Arp2 / 3 - dependent branched F - actin involved in clathrin - mediated endocytosis ; formin - mediated actin cables required for vesicle trafﬁcking ; and a formin - mediated actin contractile ring necessary for cytokinesis ( Michelot and Drubin , 2011 ) . GFP : : moesinABD , when expressed in yeast cells , labeled all three structures ( Fig - ure 3C ) . Interestingly , GFP : : utCH only labeled the Arp2 / 3 - depen - dent endocytic patches in yeast cells ( Figure 3D ) . Together , these results suggest that the synaptic F - actin network might be composed of Arp2 / 3 - dependent , branched F - actin . The actin - nucleating activity of the Arp2 / 3 complex is tightly regulated by various cytosolic proteins , including the WASP and WAVE protein complexes and their upstream regulators , the Rho family of small GTPases ( Derivery and Gautreau , 2010 ; Padrick and Rosen , 2010 ; Takenawa and Suetsugu , 2007 ) . To understand the molecular mechanisms that establish the synap - tic F - actin network , we performed a candidate screen for factors that affect the localization of synaptic F - actin . We found that the localization of GFP : : utCH at the synaptic region is drastically reduced in wve - 1 / WAVE mutants ( 24 % ± 3 % of WT ) ( Figures 3E , 3F , and 3H ) , suggesting that WAVE is required to assemble the synaptic F - actin network . In cells , the WAVE protein is consti - tutively incorporated into a ﬁve - component complex , the WAVE Regulatory Complex ( WRC ) , that is required for both its regula - tion and function ( Chen et al . , 2010b ; Eden et al . , 2002 ; Kurisu and Takenawa , 2009 ) . We observed similar reductions in GFP : : utCH labeling at synapses in gex - 3 / NAP1 mutants ( 23 % ± 2 % of WT ) , another component of the WRC ( Figures 3G and 3H ) . Furthermore , the ﬂuorescence level in the cell body is comparable between WT and wve - 1 or gex - 3 mutants , suggesting that the WRC does not regulate overall levels of F - actin but is speciﬁcally required for enrichment of F - actin at the presynaptic region . WRC mutations do not alter the distribu - tion of GFP : : moesinABD in HSN ( Figure S2 ) , further indicating that the WRC speciﬁcally patterns synaptic F - actin . We also examined a partial loss - of - function mutant of the wsp - 1 / WASP gene and observed no defect in GFP : : utCH enrichment at syn - apses ( data not shown ) . However , because this mutant allele does not completely eliminate the function of WSP - 1 and the null mutant is embryonic lethal , we are unable to comment on the role of wsp - 1 . The WRC is inactive in its basal state and is activated by the small GTPase Rac ( Chen et al . , 2010b ; Eden et al . , 2002 ; Ismail et al . , 2009 ; Lebensohn and Kirschner , 2009 ) . Three Racs exist in the C . elegans genome : ced - 10 , mig - 2 , and rac - 2 , which func - tion in a partially redundant manner to regulate axon guidance ( Shakir et al . , 2008 ) . We examined synaptic F - actin recruitment in single or compound mutants of these genes . Whereas the mig - 2 single mutant showed slightly reduced F - actin staining , the ced - 10 and rac - 2 single mutants showed no statistically signiﬁcant reduction ( Figure S3 ) . However , in both mig - 2 ; rac - 2 and ced - 10 ; rac - 2 double mutants , F - actin is dramatically reduced , suggesting that these small GTPases function redun - dantly to regulate synaptic F - actin ( Figure S3 ) . Taken together , the data above show that the synaptic F - actin network is depen - dent on a signaling pathway that involves SYG - 1 , the Rac GTPases , and the WRC . The WRC Is Required for Both Presynaptic Assembly and Axonal Branch Formation Because the WRC is involved in local F - actin assembly , it sug - gests that the WRC may be required for both synapse formation and axonal branching . We found previously that the presynaptic actin recruits scaffolding molecule NAB - 1 , which in turn seques - ters active zone proteins and synaptic vesicles . We found that NAB - 1 recruitment to synapses is signiﬁcantly reduced in wve - 1 and gex - 3 mutants , suggesting that the reduced F - actin impacts the amount of the NAB - 1 at synapses ( Figures 4A – 4C and 4M ) . Both wve - 1 and gex - 3 mutants also showed reduction in synaptic vesicle marker SNB - 1 , as well as active zone mole - cule SYD - 2 , suggesting that the WRC is required for synapse assembly ( Figures 4D – 4I and 4M ) . In contrast to these presynap - tic markers , we found that the localization of SYG - 1 remained unaffected in wve - 1 or gex - 3 mutants , suggesting that the WRC functions downstream of SYG - 1 ( Figure S4 ) . We next examined whether the WRC is also required for axonal branch formation . We observed that about 70 % of the wve - 1 and gex - 3 mutant animals fail to form collateral branches ( Figures 4J – 4L and 4N ) . This loss of branching is not due to general defects in axon outgrowth as the main HSN axon shaft is able to extend to its normal length along the ventral cord . Furthermore , we observed that enrichment of GFP : : utCH at the growing tip of the HSN axon is unaffected in wve - 1 mutants ( Figure S4 ) . Taken together , these data suggest that the WRC is required to assemble a local F - actin network directed by cell adhesion 212 Cell 156 , 208 – 220 , January 16 , 2014 ª 2014 Elsevier Inc .

This requirement for the WRC was also observed in the VC4 / 5 neurons , two ventral cord neurons that synapse onto the vulva muscles ( Figure S5 ) . SYG - 1 is not required for the branching and synapse formation of the VC4 / 5 neurons , suggesting that the WRC has more gen - eral functions ( A . Hellman and K . S . , unpublished data ) , which is consistent with prior work showing that collateral branches often initiate from actin patches ( Ketschek and Gallo , 2010 ) . The Cytoplasmic Tail of SYG - 1 Can Bind the WRC The data above argue strongly that the WRC functions down - stream of SYG - 1 to build a synaptic actin network that is required for both synapse assembly and collateral axon branching . To further understand how SYG - 1 speciﬁes the assembly of a syn - aptic F - actin network , we asked whether SYG - 1 might directly bind to the WRC . Recent work by Chen et al . ( 2014 ) in this issue of Cell had identiﬁed a consensus peptide motif , WIRS , which binds to a conserved site on the surface of the WRC ( Chen et al . , 2014 ) . This motif is found in the intracellular tails of a large Figure 4 .

Structural and biochemical studies established that WIRS binds to a com - posite surface pocket formed by the Abi and Sra subunits of the WRC . This pocket is nearly 100 % conserved in metazoans , including Drosophila and C . elegans , and the interaction recruits the WRC to the cell membrane . Based on the deﬁnition of the WIRS consensus motif , F - x - T / S - F - x - x ( F = preference for bulky hydrophobic residues ; x = any residue ) , we found that the SYG - 1 cytoplasmic tail contains a potential WIRS ( peptide sequence YGSFGS ) that is conserved throughout the nematode phyla ( Fig - ure 5A ) . Even though human NEPH1 and C . elegans SYG - 1 share very little sequence homology in their cytoplasmic tails , human NEPH1 also had a similar WIRS ( peptide sequence YSSFKD ) . To verify whether the SYG - 1 tail speciﬁcally binds to the WRC , we performed pull - down experiments by immobilizing puriﬁed recombinant human WRC fused to a tandem maltose binding protein repeat ( 2MBP - hWRC ) and asked whether it can retain puriﬁed GST - tagged C . elegans SYG - 1 cytoplasmic tail ( GST - ceSYG - 1 - CT ) . After washing , the 2MBP - hWRC was able to weakly retain the SYG - 1 cytoplasmic tail ( Figure 5B ) . Similarly , immobilized GST - ceSYG - 1 - CT was able to retain 2MBP - hWRC ( Figure 5C ) . 214 Cell 156 , 208 – 220 , January 16 , 2014 ª 2014 Elsevier Inc . We next performed a series of experiments to learn whether binding is mediated by interactions of the SYG - 1 WIRS motif and the WRC WIRS - binding surface . First , we tested the binding using a WRC with two point mutations on the WIRS binding surface that speciﬁcally eliminate the interaction between the WRC and WIRS ( 2MBP - hWRC AW , contains R106A / G110W in the Abi2 subunit ) . We found that the AW mutant under the same conditions exhibited much less binding to the SYG - 1 cyto - plasmic tail , suggesting that SYG - 1 binds to the conserved WIRS binding interface in the WRC . Reciprocally , we found that mutating two conserved residues in the SYG - 1 WIRS sequence ( ce - SYG - 1 - CT - 2Ala , peptide sequence YGAAGS ) also impairs binding to the WT WRC ( Figure 5B ) . In addition , we performed a competition assay with a synthetic WIRS - containing peptide from protocadherin 10 ( PCDH10 , the ﬁrst identiﬁed WIRS - containing protein ) ( Chen et al . , 2014 ) and found that WT Figure 5 .

GST - tagged C . elegans SYG - 1 cytoplasmic tail ( GST - ceSYG - 1 CT ) is pulled down by MBP - hWRC ( the band in the Coomassie blue gel is highlighted by the black arrow ) . Making the AW mutation in hWRC interface that interferes with WIRS binding decreases this binding . Mutating the WIRS sequence in GST - ceSYG - 1 CT ( 2Ala ) also decreases the binding efﬁciency . Competitors were chemically synthesized peptides that are 15 amino acids long ( WT and 2A for the mutant peptide ) , and only the WT peptide was able to compete for binding .

Finally , to show that the SYG - 1 WIRS sequence can interact with endogenous proteins , we performed the pull down using mouse brain lysates with immobilized GST - ce - SYG - 1 - CT . Using antibodies against Sra1 and WAVE1 , two subunits of the WRC , we observed that SYG - 1 - CT was able to pull down both compo - nents ( Figure 5D ) . Likewise , in this experiment , mutating the SYG - 1CT WIRS sequence or adding a WT competing PCDH10 WIRS peptide reduced the pull - down efﬁciency of the WRC . Although we did not have access to recombinant C . elegans WRC , we found that the SYG - 1 cytosolic domain can speciﬁcally bind to reconstituted Drosophila WRC ( Figure S6 ) . As the WIRS / WRC binding surface is completely conserved and we have observed interaction between human , mouse , and ﬂy WRC Figure 6 .

See also Figure S6 . with the SYG - 1 cytoplasmic tail , it is high - ly likely the C . elegans WRC also binds to SYG - 1 WIRS ( Chen et al . , 2014 ; Ismail et al . , 2009 ) . Together , the biochemical data above strongly indicate that the SYG - 1 cyto - plasmic tail binds to the conserved WIRS - binding surface of the WRC . Local F - actin Assembly Requires Interaction between SYG - 1 WIRS and the WRC To determine whether direct interaction between the WRC and SYG - 1 WIRS motif is required in vivo , we performed structure / function experiments on SYG - 1 and examined their ability to rescue F - actin assembly . In syg - 1 mutants , the recruitment of synaptic F - actin is defec - tive compared to WT animals as detected by the loss of mCherry : : utCH labeling ( 75 % ± 2 % reduction compared to WT ) ( Figures 6A and 6B ) . Expressing a transgene containing full - length SYG - 1 rescues this defect and restores F - actin as - sembly at the synaptic region ( Figures 6C and 6F ) . SYG - 1 lacking the entire cytoplasmic tail cannot rescue F - actin assembly ( Fig - ures 6D and 6F ) . More speciﬁcally , a SYG - 1 protein containing di - Ala mutations in the WIRS motif , which did not bind WRC in vitro ( Figure 5 ) , also failed to rescue the defects in F - actin as - sembly in syg - 1 mutants ( Figures 6E and 6F ) . Deleting the cyto - plasmic tail or mutating the WIRS sequence of SYG - 1 does not affect its ability to cluster at the HSN synaptic region , a function that is solely dependent on its extracellular domain ( Figure S6 ) . 216 Cell 156 , 208 – 220 , January 16 , 2014 ª 2014 Elsevier Inc . Thus , the SYG - 1 WIRS interaction with the WRC is important for local F - actin assembly at the synaptic region . Finally , to under - stand whether this interaction is also required for axon collateral branching , we expressed the various SYG - 1 transgenes in syg - 1 mutants and examined HSN branching with a neuronal morphology marker . Consistently , mutating the WIRS sequence in the SYG - 1 cytoplasmic tail failed to rescue the loss of branch - ing in syg - 1 mutants ( Figure 6G ) . Together , the data suggest that the SYG - 1 WIRS motif interacts with the WRC to locally generate a synaptic F - actin network that is required for both presynaptic assembly and collateral axonal branching . DISCUSSION WRC Regulates F - actin and Neuronal Development F - actin is found in various subcellular locations of neurons ( Letourneau , 2009 ; Zhang and Benson , 2002 ) . For example , cortical F - actin can be detected just underneath the plasma membrane in the neuronal cell body . In developing neurons , F - actin is also enriched at growth cones and branching sites ( Dent et al . , 2011 ; Gallo , 2011 ) . In mature neurons , F - actin is enriched at presynaptic terminals and dendrite spines ( Hotu - lainen and Hoogenraad , 2010 ; Sankaranarayanan et al . , 2003 ) . Within the pre - and postsynaptic terminals , spatially distinct populations of F - actin have been described , such as active - zone - associated F - actin or synaptic - vesicle - associated or endocytic - zone - associated actin on dendritic spines ( Bleckert et al . , 2012 ; Chia et al . , 2012 ; Frost et al . , 2010 ) . Microscopically , F - actin can adopt several different forms , including branched networks and bundled , unbranched ﬁlaments ( Bloom et al . , 2003 ; Chia et al . , 2012 ; Sankaranarayanan et al . , 2003 ; Waites et al . , 2011 ) . In a recent paper using super - resolution micro - scopy , actin and spectrin were found to form periodic ring - like structures that decorate the cortical cytoskeleton of axons in cultured hippocampal neurons . This cytoskeletal organization was not observed in dendrites ( Xu et al . , 2012 ) . Molecularly , distinct molecular programs construct different forms of F - actin ( Chhabra and Higgs , 2007 ; Michelot and Drubin , 2011 ) . For example , studies in ﬁbroblasts showed that branched actin net - works are built by an Arp2 / 3 - dependent mechanism , whereas unbranched actin bundles require molecules , including formins ( Derivery and Gautreau , 2010 ; Pruyne et al . , 2002 ) . We also found that different in vivo molecular markers of F - actin can distinguish these structures in yeast . UtrophinCH preferentially labels Arp2 / 3 - dependent endocytic patches , whereas moesi - nABD labels all forms of F - actin in yeast ( Figures 3C and 3D ) . These results raise two interesting questions in terms of the F - actin organization in neurons . First , are there distinct F - actin structures at different subcellular locations ? Second , if so , what molecular mechanisms are responsible for assembling these different structures ? Our results showed that F - actin found at HSN synapses is speciﬁcally labeled by utrophinCH . Consistently , utrophinCH labels Arp2 / 3 - dependent F - actin structures in yeast , and establishment of the F - actin network at synapses is dependent on the WRC , a multiprotein complex that activates the Arp2 / 3 complex to initiate the formation of branched F - actin ( Miki et al . , 1998 ; Padrick and Rosen , 2010 ; Pollard , 2007 ) . The roles of F - actin regulators in the development and function of presynaptic terminals have been reported in multiple systems . In Drosophila neuromuscular junctions ( NMJ ) , the actin - capping protein adducin affects the stabilization and growth of synapses . In addition , the formin - related protein diaphanous controls the growth of NMJ by regulating both actin and microtubules ( Paw - son et al . , 2008 ; Pielage et al . , 2011 ) . Interestingly , WASP and the Arp2 / 3 complex also play important roles at the ﬂy NMJ . Muta - tions in these proteins , as well as in the BAR protein Nervous Wreck , cause the formation of a highly ramiﬁed cluster of synap - tic boutons , likely through regulating endocytosis because endo - cytosis mutants exhibit similar phenotypes ( Coyle et al . , 2004 ; Rodal et al . , 2008 ) . The vertebrate active zone molecule Piccolo has also been shown to promote assembly of presynaptic F - actin and regulate presynaptic neurotransmitter release ( Waites et al . , 2011 ) . The diversity of actin regulators at presyn - aptic terminals is likely evolved to accommodate different size , shape , and functional properties of various synapses . Besides presynaptic terminals , utrophinCH also labels the axonal growth cone during HSN axon outgrowth , suggesting that branched actin is also enriched there . However , we found little axon guidance defects in wve - 1 mutants , possibly due to redundant pathways . In many processes , the WRC often func - tions redundantly with the other major Arp2 / 3 activator , WASP ( Kurisu and Takenawa , 2009 ; Tang et al . , 2013 ) . Consistent with this notion , WVE - 1 has also been shown to act together with WSP - 1 / WASP during axon guidance of sensory neuron PDE ( Shakir et al . , 2008 ) . A recent study in C . elegans also showed that partial loss of wsp - 1 causes neurons to be defective in acetylcholine transmission suggesting that WSP - 1 is involved in synapse function ( Zhang and Kubiseski , 2010 ) . Consistent with our observation that F - actin assembly at synapses is unaffected with partial loss of wsp - 1 , the study also found that synapses labeled by synaptic vesicle marker , synaptogyrin , appeared unaffected in wsp - 1 mutants . Fine control of F - actin assembly may also occur at the level of molecules that control the proteins that directly nucleate actin ﬁlaments . For example , the Rac GTPases CED - 10 / Rac and MIG - 2 / RhoG were shown to function in parallel pathways regulating WVE - 1 and WSP - 1 , respectively , in axon guidance ( Shakir et al . , 2008 ) . Cell Adhesion Molecules Dictate F - actin Organization to Promote Synapse Formation and Neuronal Arborization Various studies have shown that synaptogenesis occurs side by side with neuronal arborization . Direct observations of axon arbors in developing RGCs showed that synapses promote axon branch formation and increased branch stability ( Meyer and Smith , 2006 ) . These studies support the synaptotropic hypothesis that synapse formation can promote the elaboration of neuronal processes ( Cline and Haas , 2008 ; Vaughn , 1989 ) . Furthermore , molecular studies in RGCs also showed that the Netrin - DCC signaling pathway promotes addition of new synap - ses while also increasing branch dynamics , suggesting that syn - apse formation and branching events might be linked ( Manitt et al . , 2009 ) . Although these studies provide observations that synapse formation and axonal branching occur together , it is not clear what molecular mechanisms link these two events or whether each of these processes are dependent on one another . Cell 156 , 208 – 220 , January 16 , 2014 ª 2014 Elsevier Inc . 217 Our ﬁndings provide mechanistic insights into how synapse - directed arborization can be achieved , as both synaptogenesis and axonal branching require the same local synaptic F - actin network to proceed . A homologous process in which cell adhe - sion molecules locally induce F - actin rearrangements also occurs during myoblast fusion , where the SYG - 1 homologs , sticks and stones ( sns ) , and hibris ( hbs ) organize a podosome - like F - actin structure to invade the apposing muscle founder cell ( Jin et al . , 2011 ; Sens et al . , 2010 ) . Both WAVE and WASP are involved in this function downstream of the adhesion molecules , suggesting that the WRC / WIRS interaction in the SYG - 1 / SYG - 2 family of molecules might be conserved and used in different developmental contexts to couple membrane interactions with diverse F - actin - based cellular responses . During development , multiple sets of adhesion and diffusible cues pattern axonal projection and synaptic connections . Several pieces of evidence argue that the presynaptic F - actin network might be a common component to couple axon arbori - zation and synapse formation . For example , a recent study showed that stabilization of ﬁlopodia by neurexin - neuroligin adhesion complexes is required to promote both synaptogene - sis and dendrite arborization ( Chen et al . , 2010a ) . Furthermore , UNC - 40 / DCC receptor downstream of netrin signaling is required for formation of axon arbors , presynaptic terminals , and neurosecretory terminals . It is also noteworthy that both neuroligins and UNC - 40 / DCC contain conserved WIRS motifs in their cytoplasmic tails ( Chen et al . , 2014 ) . Both Ena / VASP and MIG - 10 / Lamellipodin , regulators of F - actin polymerization , function downstream of axon arborization ( Nelson and Colo´n - Ramos , 2013 ; Stavoe et al . , 2012 ) . Even poly - D - lysine - coated beads can induce presynaptic differentiation and local assembly of F - actin in vitro , suggesting that cell adhesion alone may be sufﬁcient to induce F - actin assembly ( Lucido et al . , 2009 ) . Together , with our data , these studies highlight the importance of cell adhesion molecules in specifying the subcellular location of F - actin rearrangements to coordinate various processes during nervous system development . Together , we provide a molecular pathway in which synaptic adhesion molecule SYG - 1 spatially links downstream synapse formation and axonal collateral branch formation by locally assembling an F - actin network . SYG - 1 exerts this function through a direct interaction with the WRC via a WIRS motif in its cytosolic tail . We propose that this interaction may potentially restrict the actin regulation activity of the WRC to desired subcellular domains .
