To a solution of 3 - Azido - 5 - cholestene ( 15 . 8 g , 38 . 4 mmol ) in dichloromethane , 4 equivalents of trimethylphosphine ( 1M solution in THF or toluene ) was added and the reaction was stirred overnight . When 3 - Azido - 5 - cholestene was consumed as evidenced by TLC ( eluent : hexane ) , the reaction was concentrated in vacuo to yield 1 ( 14 . 8 g , 100 % ) as a pure compound . 1H NMR ( 300 MHz , CDCl3 ) δ 5 . 27 ( s , 1H ) , 2 . 60 ( m , 1H ) , 2 . 17 - 0 . 85 ( m , 40H ) , 0 . 64 ( s , 3H ) ; 13C NMR ( 75 MHz , CDCl3 ) δ 141 . 8 , 120 . 7 , 56 . 8 , 56 . 2 , 52 . 0 , 50 . 3 , 43 . 4 , 42 . 3 , 39 . 8 , 39 . 5 , 38 . 2 , 36 . 6 , 36 . 2 , 35 . 8 , 32 . 7 , 31 . 9 ( × 2 ) , 28 . 3 , 28 . 0 , 24 . 3 , 23 . 9 , 22 . 8 , 22 . 6 , 21 . 0 , 19 . 5 , 18 . 7 , 11 . 9 ; IR ( film ) ν 3354 , 3260 , 3154 , 2936 , 2896 , 2849 , 1464 , 1437 , 1381 cm - 1 ; LRMS ( ESI + ) m / z 386 . 4 ( [ M + H ] + , C 27 H 48 N calcd . 386 . 4 ) . cholesteryl - 4 - amino - 4 - oxobutanoic acid ( 2 ) . To a solution of 1 ( 10g , 25 , 9mmol ) in chloroform ( 150ml ) succinic anhydride ( 7 , 8g , 77 , 9mmol ) was added . Triethylamine ( 8ml , 57 , 3mmol ) was added drop - wise to the solution and the reaction mixture was stirred overnight under nitrogen atmosphere at room temperature , until the starting material was completely consumed as evidenced by TLC ( eluent : hexane : ethylacetate 1 : 1 ) . The reaction mixture was transferred to a separatory funnel , and the organic layer was washed with water and brine , was dried with MgSO4 and was concentrated in vacuo to afford cholesterol amide acid ( 10g ) as a yellow solid . The crude cholesterol amide acid was purified by recrystallization in Acetonitrile : MeOH ( 1 : 1 ) at 4°C and was vacuum filtered to afford 2 as an off - white solid ( 8 , 7g , 76 % ) 1H NMR ( 400MHz , CDCl3 ) δ 5 . 36 ( s , 1H ) , 3 . 69 ( s , 1H ) , 3 . 60 ( m , 1H ) 2 . 62 ( m , 2H ) , 2 . 44 ( m , 2H ) , 2 . 20 - 1 . 72 ( m , 7H ) , 1 . 67 - 1 . 03 ( m , 20H ) 1 . 01 ( s , 3H ) 0 . 92 ( d , J = 6 . 5 Hz , 3H ) , 0 . 87 ( dd , J = 6 . 6 , 1 . 7 Hz , 6H ) , 0 . 69 ( s , 3H ) .

Synthetic procedure towards cholesteryl - 4 - amino - 4 - oxobutanoic acid ( compound 2 ) . 4 Synthesis of lipopeptides ( see Scheme S2 / 3 ) . E 4 ( EIAALEK ) 4 and K 4 ( KIAALKE ) 4 peptides were synthesized on an automatic CEM peptide synthesizer on a scale of 250 µmol . Fmoc chemistry was applied for this synthesis and Sieber amide resin with a loading of 0 . 69 mmol / g was used . Amino acid couplings were performed with 4 eq . of the appropriate amino acid , 4 eq . of the activator HCTU and 8 eq . of the base DIPEA . Fmoc deprotection was performed with piperidine : DMF ( 4 : 6 v / v ) . After that N 3 - PEG 4 - COOH was coupled to the peptide on the resin using 4 eq . of DIPEA and 3 eq . of HOBT in DMF overnight . After that N 3 was reduced to NH 2 using 8 eq . of P ( CH 3 ) 3 ( 1 M in toluene ) in dioxane / H 2 O 4 : 1 mixture . In the final step cholesteryl - 4 - amino - 4 - oxobutanoic acid ( compound 2 , 2 eq ) was coupled to the PEG4 linker using 5 eq . of DIPEA and 4 eq . of PyBOP in DMF : DCM ( 2 : 1 ) over 72 h . CP 4 K 4 or CP 4 E 4 lipopeptide was cleaved from the resin by shaking the resin with a mixture of TFA / TIS / H 2 O ( 95 : 2 . 5 : 2 . 5 v / v ) for 1 . 5 hour . The cleavage mixture was precipitated in cold diethyl ether . Precipitate was collected and the crude product was purified by RF - HPLC using a Vydac C4 reversed phase column ( 214TP1022 , 22 mm diameter , 250 mm length , 10 µm particle size ) . Crude lipopeptides were eluted with a linear gradient from 20 % to 80 % of acetonitrile in water with 0 . 1 % TFA ( v / v ) over 36 min with the flow of 20 mL / min . Sample elusion was detected by UV detection at 214 nm and 256 nm . The purity of the collected fractions were confirmed using LC - MS ( Gemini 3 µ C18 column coupled with Finningan LCQ advantage max ( Thermo ) ESI - MS analyze ) . CP 4 K 4 : LC - MS m / z Calcd .

Cell culture Hela , NIH / 3T3 , and CHO cells were grown as a monolayer at 37 °C in 7 % CO 2 atmosphere , and were maintained in a continuous logarithmic culture in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium ( DMEM ) containing phenol red completed with 10 % Fetal Calf Serum ( FCS ) , penicillin / streptomycin ( 100 6 units / ml , 0 . 1 mg / ml , respectively ) , and Glutamax ( 2 mM ) . Medium was replaced every 3 days and cells were passaged by trypsinization at 70 % confluence . Uveal melanoma cells ( Mel 270 ) were maintained in RPMI1640 medium with 10 % FCS and 2 mM Glutamax . Liposome preparation for lipid mixing assay The mixing of lipids between batches of liposomes was assayed according to Struck ( D . Struck , Biochemistry 1981 , 20 , 4093 - 4099 ) . Fluorescence experiments were performed using the fluorescent resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) pair DOPE - NBD ( λ ex = 460 nm , λ em = 534 nm ) and DOPE - LR ( λ ex = 550 nm , λ em = 590 nm ) . CPE 4 - decorated liposomes had no fluorescent labels , while fluorescent CPK - decorated liposomes were prepared ( DOPC / DOPE / CHO / DOPE - LR / DOPE - NBD 49 . 5 : 24 . 75 : 24 . 75 : 0 . 5 : 0 . 5 mol % ) . The 0 % value was determined by measuring NBD emission of K liposomes to which an equal amount of PBS was added , F ( t ) was the fluorescence intensity measured when 100 µl of the fluorescent - labeled CPK 4 - liposomes was mixed with non - labeled CPE liposomes at time t . The 100 % value was determined by using liposomes which contained half the probe ( NBD and LR ) concentrations . The percentage of fluorescence increase ( % F ( t ) ) is calculated as % F ( t ) = ( F ( t ) - F 0 ) / ( Fmax - F 0 ) . Lipid mixing at 4 ºC was measured every 120 seconds , in between measurements the plate was kept on ice . Decorated liposome preparation for contents mixing assay The mixing of aqueous contents between batches of liposomes was assayed according to Wilschut et al . 1 For this assay , fluorescence time series measurements were started immediately after mixing 100 µl of the fluorescent - labeled ( 20 mM sulphorhodamine ) liposome suspension with 100 µl of unlabeled liposome suspension in 96 well plate . The sulphorhodamine fluorescence intensity at 580 nm was monitored in a continuous fashion for 3600 seconds . After that the liposomes were lysed by the addition of 10 µl of 10 wt % Triton X - 100 in PBS to obtain 100 % values . The percentage of fluorescence increase ( % F ( t ) ) is calculated as % F ( t ) = ( F ( t ) - F0 ) / ( F max - F 0 ) where F ( t ) is the fluorescence intensity measured at time t , F 0 is the 0 % fluorescence and F max is the fluorescence intensity measured after addition of Triton x - 100 . The experiment was performed in three replicates . 7 Supplementary Figure 1 . Content mixing between CP 4 K 4 and CP 4 E 4 liposomes .
