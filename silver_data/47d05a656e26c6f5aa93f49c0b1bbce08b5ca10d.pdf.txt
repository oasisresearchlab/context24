Received : 2018 . 11 . 24 ; Accepted : 2019 . 05 . 14 ; Published : 2019 . 07 . 10 Abstract Background : Actinins are major cytoskeletal proteins that mediate sarcomere function , and they also have important non - muscle functions such as regulating cytokinesis , cell adhesion and migration . There are four isoforms of actinins in mammals ( ACTN1 - 4 ) . Recently , the relationship between actinins and cancer has been discovered in many types of malignancy , yet their prognostic significance in acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) remains unclear . Methods : We collected data of 155 de novo AML patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas ( TCGA ) database ; 85 patients received chemotherapy only and 70 patients underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( allo - HSCT ) . We divided each treatment groups into sub - groups based on the median expression levels of ACTN1 - 4 . Results : Survival analysis showed that in the chemotherapy - only group , high ACTN1 and ACTN3 expression were associated with shorter event - free survival ( EFS ) and overall survival ( OS ) ( p < 0 . 01 ) . Multivariate analysis suggested that high expression of ACTN1 and ACTN3 ( p < 0 . 05 ) were independent poor prognostic factors . In the allo - HSCT group , ACTN1 - 4 expression had no impact on survival . Conclusions : Our study suggested that high expression levels of ACTN1 and ACTN3 adversely affected the survival of AML patients , but their harmful impact could be overcome by allo - HSCT . Key words : acute myeloid leukemia ; ACTN1 ; ACTN3 ; prognosis Background Acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) is a highly heterogeneous and aggressive malignancy of the undifferentiated or partially - differentiated bone marrow myeloid stem cells and progenitor cells 1 . In the past decade , next generation sequencing ( NGS ) technique has been widely used and became a powerful tool in AML research , greatly improving our understanding of the genetic basis of the disease . Many prognostic biomarkers were found with the help of NGS . For example , NPM1 mutation and biallelic CEBPA mutations are favorable factors , associating with longer event - free survival ( EFS ) and overall survival ( OS ) . On the other hand , the present of FLT3 - ITD and MLL - PTD , mutations in DNMT3A , RUNX1 , TET2 , and KRAS are predictors for poor outcomes in AML patients 2 - 4 . In addition , aberrant epigenetic modification , i . e . , dysregulated expression levels of certain genes , may also influence the prognosis . Actinins are a group of cytoskeletal molecules that belongs to the actin filament cross - linking proteins 5 . There are four actinin isoforms in mammals , namely ACTN1 - 4 . ACTN1 and ACTN4 are universally expressed in most tissues and cell types . Ivyspring International Publisher Journal of Cancer 2019 , Vol . 10 http : / / www . jcancer . org 4287 ACTN2 are mainly expressed in the myocardium , skeletal muscle and brain . ACTN3 mostly appear in the skeletal muscle . In muscle cells , actinins link the adjacent sarcomeres together through thin filaments , to coordinate muscle contraction . In non - muscle cells , actinins also exhibit a myriad of functions 6 . Actinins participate in cytokinesis by balancing the contraction of myosin II , forming a contractile ring with the latter to eventually divide the mother cell in two . Actinins can format and disassemble cell - matrix adhesion through the activation of phosphoinositide 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) , or build different cell - cell adhesions by working with integrins and intercellular adhesion molecules ( ICAMs ) . They are also indispensable for endocytosis and exocytosis , which are essential biological processes for neurons and synapses . ACTN4 has recently been found to be a transcriptional regulator . Since ACTN4’s prognostic value in breast cancer was established , many works have been done to investigate the role of actinins in cancer prognostication and tumorigenesis 7 . Increased expression of ACTN4 has been associated with poor prognosis in ovarian cancer , colorectal cancer and acute lymphoblastic leukemia 8 - 10 . ACTN1 is crucial for glioma cell motility , and it also plays an important role in lung adenocarcinoma 11 , 12 . There are also studies pointing out the interactions between ACTN2 and ACTN3 with the parafibromin tumor suppressor protein , one of the proteins that is involved in the hypermethylation and suppression of many oncogenes 13 . However , the impacts of ACTN1 - 4 on the clinical and biological features of AML , as well as their prognostic value , remain unclear . Herein , we analyzed the relationship between the expression levels of ACTN1 - 4 and the outcomes of AML patients , hoping to guide future research in these areas . Methods Patients We screened for de novo AML patients with ACTN1 - 4 expression data at diagnosis from The Cancer Genome Atlas ( TCGA ) database . A total of 155 patients had available data for analysis . Among them , 85 patients received only chemotherapy ( chemotherapy - only group ) and 70 patients underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( allo - HSCT , allo - HSCT group ) . Baseline demographic , laboratory and genetic data were downloaded from the TCGA public website . Gene expression profiling was performed on the Affymetrix U133 plus 2 platform . The Clinical endpoints were event - free survival ( EFS ) and overall survival ( OS ) . EFS is the time from diagnosis to removal from the study due to death , relapse , failure to achieve complete remission ( CR ) , or censored at the last follow - up . OS is the time from diagnosis to death from any cause or censored at the last follow - up . Written informed consent was obtained from all patients , and the database was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of Washington University . Statistical analysis The clinical and biological characteristics of patients were summarized by descriptive statistics . Numerical data was compared using the Mann - Whitney U test and categorical data was compared using the Chi - square test . Survival was depicted by the Kaplan - Meier method and compared by the log - rank test . Cox proportional hazard models were constructed for multivariate analysis in search of independent factors that influenced survival . Hazard ratios were presented with 95 % confidence intervals . A two - sided P - value < 0 . 05 was considered statistically significant for all statistical analyses . All statistical analyses were performed by SPSS Version 20 . 0 software . Results Comparison of EFS and OS between different expression levels of ACTN1 - 4 We divided the chemotherapy - only group ( n = 85 ) and allo - HSCT group ( n = 70 ) patients into high and low - expression subgroups by their median ACTN1 - 4 expression levels at diagnosis . ACTN1 - 4 expression levels ≥ median was defined as high expression of the respective gene ; others were defined as low expression . Kaplan - Meier method and the log - rank test were used for the analysis of EFS and OS between the high and low expression groups of each ACTN ( Table 1A and 1B ) . In the chemotherapy - only group , patients with high expression levels of ACTN1 and ACTN3 had significantly shorter EFS ( p = 0 . 002 , 0 . 006 , respectively ) and OS ( p = 0 . 003 , 0 . 006 , respectively ) , as shown in Figure 1A - D . ACTN 2 was also influential ( p = 0 . 025 for EFS , p = 0 . 039 for OS ) . However , ACTN4 had no effect on EFS and OS . There was no statistical significance in survival between each ACTN high and low - expression subgroups in the allo - HSCT group . Association of clinical and biological characteristics with ACTN1 or ACTN3 expression levels As demonstrated above , ACTN1 and ACTN3 had more significant impact on EFS and OS than ACTN2 and ACTN4 , hence we analyzed the association Journal of Cancer 2019 , Vol . 10 http : / / www . jcancer . org 4288 between the clinical , biological features and the expression levels of ACTN1 ( high vs . low ) and ACTN3 ( high vs . low ) in the entire cohort ( n = 155 , Table 2 ) . High ACTN1 expression was associate with more patients over age 60 ( p = 0 . 037 ) , lower WBC counts ( p = 0 . 010 ) , fewer patients with FAB - M4 ( p = 0 . 032 ) , more patients with complex karyotype ( p = 0 . 022 ) or poor - risk cytogenetics ( p = 0 . 001 ) . Patient with higher ACTN1 also had higher frequencies in TP53 ( p = 0 . 005 ) and WT1 ( p = 0 . 018 ) . High ACTN3 expression was associate with more patients > 60 years old , lower WBC counts , fewer patients with FAB - M4 subtype and more with FAB - M0 ( p = 0 . 002 , p = 0 . 002 , p = 0 . 018 , and p = 0 . 001 , respectively ) . Similar to ACTN1 , patients with high ACTN3 expression also tended to have complex karyotype and poor - risk cytogenetics ( both p = 0 . 000 ) . Fewer FLT3 mutations ( p = 0 . 002 ) , more frequent IDH1 / 2 mutations ( p = 0 . 049 ) and TP53 mutations ( p = 0 . 005 ) were found in high ACTN3 expression patients . Table 1A .

Prognostic impact of ACTN1 and ACTN3 expression in AML patients Kaplan - Meier survival curves suggested that in the chemotherapy - only group , AML patients with high expressions of either ACTN1 or ACTN3 had shorter EFS and OS compared with patients with low expressions ( p = 0 . 002 for EFS , p = 0 . 003 for OS , Figure 2A and 2B ) . However , no significant difference was found when doing similar comparison in the allo - HSCT group ( p > 0 . 05 , Figure 3A and 3B ) . Multivariate analysis was implemented to evaluate the prognostic value of clinical and biological variables in the chemotherapy - only group in order to avoid the influence of allo - HSCT . The expression levels of ACTN1 , ACTN2 and ACTN3 ( high vs . low ) , age ( ≥60 vs . < 60 years ) , WBC count ( ≥15 vs . < 15×109 / L ) , FLT3 - ITD ( positive vs . negative ) and other common AML mutations with relatively high frequency in this study ( NPM1 , DNMT3A , IDH1 / 2 , RUNX1 , TET2 and NRAS / KRAS ; mutated vs . wild Figure 1 . Expression levels of ACTN1 / ACTN3 and patients’ outcome in the chemotherapy - only group ( n = 85 ) . Patients with high expression levels of ACTN1 and ACTN3 had significantly shorter EFS ( p = 0 . 002 , 0 . 006 , respectively , Figures 1A and 1C ) and OS ( p = 0 . 003 , 0 . 006 , respectively , Figures 1B and 1D ) . Journal of Cancer 2019 , Vol . 10 http : / / www . jcancer . org 4289 type ) , were selected to construct the Cox regression model ( Table 3 ) . High expression levels of ACTN1 ( p = 0 . 007 for EFS , p = 0 . 021 for OS ) and ACTN3 ( p = 0 . 048 for EFS , p = 0 . 018 for OS ) , older age ( p = 0 . 000 for EFS , p = 0 . 002 for OS ) independently contributed to poor prognosis .

Discussion Since Honda , et . al . , 7 found that ACTN4 was associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients , much laboratory and clinical work has been done to illustrate the relationship between actinins and solidary tumors , but little attention had been paid to that between actinins and hematological disorders . Our study was among the first to glimpse into the prognostic significance of ACTN1 - 4 in AML patients . High expression levels of ACTN1 and ACTN3 acted as adverse factors for outcome in the chemotherapy - only group . However , in the allo - HSCT group , we did not observe any effect of ACTN1 and ACTN3 on the patients’ survival . ACTN4 has been wildly studied for its function in tumors . Like ACTN4 , ACTN1 is expressed in most cell types . Given the many similarities in amino acid sequence and actin - binding properties , it would be possible for different ACTNs to have overlapping functions . 6 ACTN1 participates in the assembly of F - actin at invadopodia , modulates cell adhesion through regulation of focal adhesion kinase - Src interaction 14 , 15 . Increased level of ACTN1 in the cell promotes migration and loss of polarity by reorganizing the actin cytoskeleton and E - cadherin - based adhesions 16 . ACTN3 is the “speed gene” that determines the performances of athletes , with 18 % of the human population totally deficient in this gene 17 , but its functions in diseases have rarely been studied . The knocking - off of ACTN3 in mouse muscle can increase the activity of aerobic metabolism and influence sarcomere composition in a dose - dependent fashion 18 . The oncogenic effect of ACTN1 and the metabolic effect of ACTN3 could help explain the findings in our study , though the clear pathophysiological mechanism requires careful laboratory experiments to further delineate . As the role of actinins in cancer progression became clear in recent years , targeted treatment against actinins has been under development . Craig , et . al . , used small interfering RNAs to reduce the expression of ACTN1 in murine tumor cells . ACTN1 silencing disrupted cancer cell adhesion to murine surgical wounds and thereby prolonged the tumor - free survival 19 . Previous studies also reported that transforming growth factor beta ( TGF - β ) could induce ACTN1 mRNA expression , so targeting TGF - β would be an alternative way to suppress ACTN 20 , 21 . Our study pointed out that ACTN1 and ACTN3 might also be potential targets in AML treatment . High ACTN1 / 3 expression was associated with some of the traditional AML risk factors , such as older age , complex karyotype , and poor - risk cytogenetics . Despite the associations , ACTN1 / 3 expression independently contributed to the poor prognosis in AML patients receiving only chemotherapy . This highlights the fact that although AML prognostication is complex and many factors are intertwined , a single gene could still exert a strong impact . Allo - HSCT is a powerful treatment of AML to and it can overcome the harmful effect of some high - risk molecular biomarkers 22 . In our study , the adverse effect of high expression levels of ACTN1 and ACTN3 was not observed in the allo - HSCT group , suggesting that allo - HSCT might surmount the adverse effect of ACTN1 and ACTN3 overexpression in AML patients . Conclusion In conclusion , our study found that high expression levels of ACTN1 and ACTN3 at diagnosis indicated unfavorable outcome in AML patients . The pathophysiological mechanism behind this remained to be elucidated . In the future , ACTN1 and ACTN3 could be considered used as biomarkers and indicators for allo - HSCT in AML , if their significant prognostic value were to be confirmed in larger prospective cohorts .
