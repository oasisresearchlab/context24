They are found in heteropentameric complexes whose role in regulating WAVE function is presently unclear . Here we demonstrate that puri - ﬁed native WAVE complexes are basally inactive ; previous reports of constitutive activity are artifacts of in vitro manipulation . Further , the native com - plexes are not activated by Rac alone . Activation of the WAVE2 complex requires simultaneous interac - tions with prenylated Rac - GTP and acidic phospho - lipids , as well as a speciﬁc state of phosphorylation . Together these signals promote full activation in a highly cooperative process on the membrane surface , by inducing an allosteric change in the com - plex rather than by simple recruitment or by dissoci - ation of the subunits . These results explain how the WAVE complex can integrate coincident signals to promote localized actin nucleation during cell motility . INTRODUCTION During cell motility , extracellular signals drive global and dynamic reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton . Immense progress has been made in delineating the initial signaling events at transmembrane receptors , characterizing the downstream signal transduction pathways , and establishing the molecular features of actin nucleation . Yet , how multiple signals are inte - grated to control actin assembly as a coordinated process is still poorly understood . Of central signiﬁcance are the WAVE family proteins ( and the related WASP proteins ) , which link upstream signals to actin assembly by stimulating the activity of the Arp2 / 3 complex , an important actin nucleator ( Goley and Welch , 2006 ; Takenawa and Suetsugu , 2007 ) . WAVE proteins are involved in some of the principal pathways driving membrane protrusion and have a central role in cell motility , cell polarity , and morphologic change in perhaps all animals and plants . Often within seconds of a signal , they promote actin polymerization at the plasma membrane . Yet WAVE itself is generally not localized , and hence the key to its function is its discrete spatial and temporal regula - tion . Not surprisingly , the principal upstream signals implicated in WAVE regulation are either components of the plasma membrane or are targeted to it . The small G protein Rac , an essential player in cell motility and chemotaxis ( Heasman and Ridley , 2008 ) , was the ﬁrst suggested regulator of WAVE ( Miki et al . , 1998 ) . Rac can recruit WAVE to the plasma membrane , and its effects on actin are largely dependent on WAVE ( Miki et al . , 1998 ; Steffen et al . , 2004 ) . The membrane lipid phospha - tidylinositol ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) trisphosphate ( PIP 3 ) is another important regu - lator of cell polarity and migration ( Kolsch et al . , 2008 ) that can recruit WAVE to the plasma membrane and has been implicated in WAVE - dependent processes ( Oikawa et al . , 2004 ; Sossey - Alaoui et al . , 2005 ) . IRSp53 , a signaling protein with the ability to deform membranes , has been proposed to modulate WAVE2 activity ( Miki et al . , 2000 ; Suetsugu et al . , 2006 ) , and phosphorylation of WAVE proteins has also been reported to play a regulatory role ( Ardern et al . , 2006 ; Danson et al . , 2007 ; Kim et al . , 2006 ; Leng et al . , 2005 ; Sossey - Alaoui et al . , 2007 ; Stuart et al . , 2006 ) . Yet the precise roles and contributions of these regulators , and most importantly , where they act in a complex pathway , are still ill deﬁned . Like the related WASP proteins , WAVE1 , WAVE2 , and WAVE3 contain C - terminal VCA domains that can bind both the Arp2 / 3 complex and actin monomers to promote actin nucleation ( Pollard , 2007 ) . But in contrast to WASP and N - WASP , the iso - lated WAVE polypeptide is not autoinhibited , and hence its VCA domain can constitutively activate the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Mache - sky et al . , 1999 ) . Furthermore , unlike WASP and N - WASP , WAVE proteins lack a G protein binding domain , so regulation by Rac cannot be direct . However , in cells , WAVE proteins are found as a complex ( the WAVE complex ) with four other proteins : Pir121 , Nap 1 , Abi - 1 , and HSPC300 or their homologs ( Eden et al . , 2002 ; Gautreau et al . , 2004 ) . Importantly , Pir121 and its homolog Sra - 1 can bind activated Rac ( Kobayashi et al . , 1998 ) , and Nap 1 can bind the SH3 domain of the adaptor protein Nck ( Kitamura et al . , 1996 ) . Although it is clear that the WAVE complex plays an important regulatory role , its biochemical characterization has been difﬁcult and contentious . Our group initially found that the WAVE1 complex was inactive in vitro , suggesting that one or more subunits inhibit the VCA domain in trans ( Eden et al . , 2002 ) . Furthermore , the complex could be activated by Rac or Nck , which appeared to promote its dissociation . Other researchers found that WAVE1 and WAVE2 complexes reconstituted from recombinant proteins were constitutively active and that Rac binding had no effect on activity ( Innocenti et al . , 2004 ) . They argued that Rac merely localized the active complexes to the membrane without 512 Molecular Cell 36 , 512 – 524 , November 13 , 2009 ª 2009 Elsevier Inc . promoting dissociation ( Innocenti et al . , 2004 ; Steffen et al . , 2004 ) . In agreement with this view , WAVE complexes puriﬁed in native form or from cells overexpressing tagged WAVE were also found to be constitutively active ( Kim et al . , 2006 ; Suetsugu et al . , 2006 ) . However , others still found complexes from cells expressing tagged Abi - 1 to be intrinsically inactive ( Derivery et al . , 2009 ) , and while this manuscript was under review , one study of reconstituted complexes suggested that they were inhibited but could be activated with very high concentrations of Rac ( Ismail et al . , 2009 ) . Thus the nature of WAVE complex regulation remains a matter of debate , possibly due to differences in experimental conditions for puriﬁcation or reconstitution . We therefore chose to examine native complexes , being especially careful to preserve their bio - logical properties . We found that puriﬁed native WAVE2 and WAVE1 complexes are inactive , in agreement with the original report from our laboratory and other recent work ( Derivery et al . , 2009 ; Eden et al . , 2002 ; Ismail et al . , 2009 ) , but in contrast to some of those studies , we could not activate the complexes solely with Rac or Nck . Furthermore , we could explain previous results by showing that experimental manipulation can result in spontaneous activation . Having established the inactivity of the native complex , we were faced with uncovering the physiolog - ical requirements for activation . To do this , we developed a gentle and highly efﬁcient immunopuriﬁcation method that enabled us to deﬁne conditions for activation of the native WAVE2 complex . There are three requirements : ( 1 ) binding to prenylated Rac - GTP , ( 2 ) binding to lipid vesicles containing acidic phospholipids , and ( 3 ) a speciﬁc state of phosphorylation . What was striking is that all three inputs had to be present simul - taneously to generate any activity of the complex ; partial activa - tion was not achieved by any subset of these conditions . The WAVE2 complex is activated fully to the level of isolated WAVE2 protein in a highly cooperative process on the lipid membrane surface without dissociation of subunits . These results clarify most of the controversy about WAVE regulation , establish where the key regulators act in the pathway , and show how the WAVE complex integrates coincident signals to promote localized actin nucleation on the plasma membrane . RESULTS Native WAVE Complexes Are Basally Inactive and Are Not Activated by Rac or Nck We puriﬁed native WAVE2 complex from pig leukocytes ( we use the term ‘‘native’’ to refer to endogenous WAVE complexes that do not contain any recombinantly expressed subunits ) , whose activity had not been previously studied . A ﬁve - step puriﬁcation ( Figure 1A ) yielded very pure complex containing the ﬁve known subunits ( Figure 1B ) . When we mixed the puriﬁed WAVE2 complex withArp2 / 3andactininthepyrene - actin polymerization assay , we found that it was basally inactive even at the highest concentration tested , 120 nM ( Figure 1C ) . Given that the activity of 0 . 25 nM isolated recombinant WAVE2 protein can be easily detected ( see Figure S1A available online ) , we conclude that the puriﬁed WAVE2 complex has less than 0 . 2 % of the activity of the uncomplexed WAVE polypeptide . We could not activate this complex by addition of constitutively active prenylated Rac2 - GTP or Nck ( Figure 1D ) . To rule out the possibility that puri - ﬁcation and handling had simply inactivated the WAVE2 subunit , we showed that we could induce activity by partial thermal dena - turation of the puriﬁed complex . Recombinant WAVE2 protein loses activity when it is heated to 60 (cid:2) C and then cooled prior to being assayed , but it is unaffected at lower temperatures ( Fig - ure S1B ) . We found that heating the WAVE2 complex to 57 (cid:2) C generated substantial activity ( Figure 1E ) . Hence the inactive WAVE2 complex must contain WAVE2 protein capable of activity , but this activity is inhibited within the complex . WAVE2 and WAVE1 are found in complexes containing different homologs of some of the constituent subunits ( Eden et al . , 2002 ; Gautreau et al . , 2004 ) . They have different expres - sion patterns and exhibit specialized functions , suggesting possible differences in their regulation ( Suetsugu et al . , 1999 , 2003 ) . Previous studies from our laboratory had shown that the WAVE1 complex is inactive and can be activated by Rac or Nck ( Eden et al . , 2002 ) . Using a puriﬁcation strategy similar to that for the WAVE2 complex ( Figure 1A ) , we puriﬁed the native WAVE1 complex from bovine brain ( Figure 1B ) , the same source used during the initial characterization of that complex . Like the WAVE2 complex , the puriﬁed WAVE1 complex was inactive and could not be activated by unprenylated Rac1 - GTP alone or in combination with Nck ( Figure 1F ) . We veriﬁed the functionality of Rac and of Nck ( Figures S1C and S1D ) . As with the leukocyte WAVE2 complex , heat denaturation revealed the activity of WAVE1 in the native complex ( Figure 1F ) . Recently Ismail and colleagues reported experiments using WAVE1 complex produced by coexpression of recombinant subunits ( Ismail et al . , 2009 ) . The complex was basally inactive but could be activated in vitro by addition of unprenylated Rac1 bound to the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog GMPPNP . Of concern was the extraordinarily high concentration of Rac1 - GMPPNP required for activation , 5 – 7 . 5 m M . We tested whether native WAVE1 complex could be activated under similar condi - tions and found using their protocol that 7 . 5 m M unprenylated Rac1 - GMPPNP did not yield detectable activity ( Figure S1E ) . Our experiments are also inconsistent with another study showing that native WAVE1 complex puriﬁed from rat brains is constitutively active ( Kim et al . , 2006 ) . Since heat denaturation generates activity , we suspected that adventitious denaturation might have caused a similar effect . During their puriﬁcation , Kim and colleagues froze the complex in buffer without cryopro - tectants and thawed aliquots for each assay ( Kim et al . , 2006 ) . When we freeze thawed our inactive WAVE1 complex under their conditions , we generated substantial activity ( Figure 1G ) . This was prevented by adding 10 % glycerol as a cryoprotectant ( Fig - ure 1G ) . Even routine biochemical procedures , such as elution with 0 . 5 M KCl or prolonged storage on ice , can generate activity ( Figures S1F and S1G ) . The fact that the inactive state of the native complex can be so easily compromised in vitro may explain the observed constitutive activity and activation of the complexreportedpreviouslyintheliterature ( seetheDiscussion ) . Prenylated Rac - GTP and Acidic Phospholipids Activate the WAVE2 Complex in a Highly Cooperative Process To improve the chances of isolating an inactive but activatable WAVE complex , we devised a rapid puriﬁcation protocol .

We achieved a similar purity to the conven - tional puriﬁcation in less than 24 hr rather than 2 weeks . Immu - nopuriﬁcation allowed us to use smaller amounts of starting material , making it feasible to purify the complex from cultured cells , a more homogeneous source that can be experimentally B C E A Pig leukocyte or bovine brain extract Ammonium sulfate cut ( 20 % - 30 % ) Cation exchange ( SP Sepharose HP ) Anion exchange ( Mono Q / Q Sepharose HP ) Gel filtration ( Superose 6 ) Anion exchange ( Mono Q ) [ Sucrose gradient ] ( 5 % - 20 % ) Native WAVE2 or WAVE1 complex D G 200 – 116 – 97 – 66 – 45 – MW ( KDa ) – Pir121 – HEM - 1 – WAVE2 Abi - 2 31 – WAVE2complex WAVE1complex – Pir121 – Abi - 1 – Nap 1 – WAVE1 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 0 500 1000 1500 F l uo r esce n ce ( a r b i t r a r y un i t s ) Time ( seconds ) rWAVE2 ( 16 nM ) WAVE2c ( 120 nM ) WAVE2c ( 40 nM ) WAVE2c ( 4 nM ) No addition Actin + Arp2 / 3 + 0 5 10 15 20 0 350 700 1050 1400 F l uo r esce n ce ( a r b i t r a r y un i t s ) Time ( seconds ) WAVE1c ( 57°C ) WAVE1c + uRac1 - GTP + Nck WAVE1c + Nck WAVE1c + uRac1 - GTP WAVE1c No addition Actin + Arp2 / 3 + 0 10 20 30 40 0 350 700 1050 1400 F l uo r esce n ce ( a r b i t r a r y un i t s ) Time ( seconds ) WAVE1c ( XB ) WAVE1c ( XB + 10 % glycerol ) No addition Actin + Arp2 / 3 + F 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 0 500 1000 1500 F l uo r esce n ce ( a r b i t r a r y un i t s ) Time ( seconds ) rWAVE2 WAVE2c + pRac2 - GTP + Nck WAVE2c + Nck WAVE2c + pRac2 - GTP WAVE2c Actin + Arp2 / 3 + 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 0 500 1000 1500 F l uo r esce n ce ( a r b i t r a r y un i t s ) Time ( seconds ) WAVE2c ( 57°C ) WAVE2c ( 50°C ) WAVE2c ( untreated ) No addition Actin + Arp2 / 3 + 6 . 5 – – HSPC300 – HSPC300 Figure 1 .

This was useful because it allowed us to test growth factor stimulation , which was known to induce posttranslational modiﬁcations in the WAVE2 complex ( Danson et al . , 2007 ) . We puriﬁed the WAVE2 complex from A - 431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells stimulated with epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) . The complex contained the ﬁve core subunits as conﬁrmed by mass spectrometry ( Figure 2A and Table S1 ) . Among other proteins that coeluted with the complex , we identiﬁed IRSp53 ( Figure 2A , Table S1 , and data not shown ) . This native WAVE2 complex preparation was almost com - pletely inactive ( Figure 2B ) , indicating that immunopuriﬁcation did not denature the complex and suggesting that the additional proteins present in this preparation , including IRSp53 , were not sufﬁcient for activation . A trace of activity was present in some preparations ( Figure 2B ) , possibly due to a small amount of uncomplexed WAVE2 protein . When we tested several potential activators , we found that the combination of prenylated Rac1 - GTP and liposomes containing 10 % PIP 3 ( ‘‘PIP 3 liposomes’’ throughout the text ) led to robust activation , comparable to the activity generated by the same molar concentration of isolated recombinant WAVE2 protein ( Figure 2B ) . Therefore , we had achieved full activation of an inactive native WAVE2 complex . Individually , prenylated Rac1 - GTP or PIP 3 liposomes generated no activity ( Figure 2B ) . The observed actin polymerization was due to activation of the complex and not to enhancement of the activity of any free WAVE2 present in the preparation , since addition of PIP 3 liposomes and prenylated Rac1 - GTP to recombinant WAVE2 protein had essentially no effect on activity ( Figure S2A ) . Similarly , the activity was not due to any contami - nating N - WASP , since an inhibitory antibody speciﬁc to WAVE2 ( Figure S2B ) inhibited almost completely the measured activity of the WAVE2 complex ( Figure S2C ) . The activity of the WAVE2 complex was completely dependent on Arp2 / 3 ( Figure S2C ) . Activation of the WAVE2 complex depended on the nucleotide state of Rac ( Figure 2C ) . Targeting of Rac to the liposomes was important for activation , since unprenylated Rac1 - GTP yielded much less activity than prenylated Rac1 - GTP ( Figure 2C ) , even though both unprenylated and prenylated Rac1 - GTP were equally active in other assays ( Figure S1C ) . Prenylated Rac was indeed incorporated into the liposomes as determined by cosedimentation ( see below and Figure S3A ) . Although Rac1 is the most ubiquitous form of Rac , cells of hematopoietic lineage also express high levels of Rac2 . Rac2 in combination with PIP 3 liposomes activated the WAVE2 complex robustly ( Figure 2D ) , and activation was dependent on the nucleotide and prenylation state of Rac2 ( Figure 2D and Figure S1C ) . Activation was speciﬁc for Rac , since Cdc42 , another GTPase of the Rho family , failed to activate the complex when assayed with PIP 3 liposomes ( Figure 2D ) . The functionality of Cdc42 was conﬁrmed by its ability to induce actin assembly in Xenopus egg extracts , an N - WASP - dependent process ( Lebensohn et al . , 2006 ) . The speciﬁcity of PIP 3 would be important , since PIP 3 is polar - ized during directed cell migration ( Kolsch et al . , 2008 ) . Although PIP 3 isthemostpotentactivator , wefoundthatotheracidicphos - pholipids can exert similar effects ; liposomes containing several negatively charged lipids , including phosphatidylinositol ( 4 , 5 ) bi - sphosphate ( PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) , phosphatidylinositol ( 3 , 5 ) bisphosphate ( PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 ) , phosphoatidylinositol ( PI ) , and even phosphatidylser - ine ( PS ) could activate the WAVE2 complex in combination with prenylated Rac1 - GTP ( Figure 2E ) . Although the total net charge on the liposomes correlated with activation , these results rule out a speciﬁc interaction with the phosphoinositol head group . At sufﬁciently high concentration , even PS , which lacks this head group , can activate the complex efﬁciently ( Figure 2E ) . On the other hand , liposomes composed entirely of lipids with no net charge , such as phosphatidylcholine ( PC ) and phosphatidyl - ethanolamine ( PE ) , failed to activate the WAVE2 complex in combination with prenylated Rac1 - GTP ( Figure 2E ) . We studied the interplay between Rac and acidic phospho - lipids by titrating these two effectors . We generated liposomes with a background of PC and PI and varied the molar percentage of PIP 3 using a ﬁxed concentration of total lipid and prenylated Rac1 - GTP . Activation ( measured as maximal actin polymeriza - tion rate ) as a function of percent PIP 3 could be ﬁtted to a hyper - bolic trace with half - maximal activation at 6 . 1 % PIP 3 ( Figure 2F ) . No activation was detected in the absence of Rac , even with 10 m M liposomes containing 30 % PIP 3 ( Figure 2F ) . We also titrated Rac1 - GTP with two lipid conditions . With liposomes containing 10 % PIP 3 , half - maximal activation required approxi - mately 25 nM prenylated Rac1 - GTP , while at 30 % PIP 3 , half - maximal activation occurred near 6 . 25 nM prenyalted Rac1 - GTP ( Figure 2G ) . In the absence of lipids , up to 100 nM prenylated Rac1 - GTP , and up to 10 m M unprenylated Rac1 - GTP did not produce detectable activation ( Figure 2G ) . Repeating the exact conditions on the native WAVE2 complex that Ismail and col - leagues used to activate the recombinant WAVE1 complex ( 7 . 5 m M unprenylated Rac1 - GMPPNP ) ( Ismail et al . , 2009 ) , we found no measurable activation ( Figure 2G ) . These data highlight the remarkable tightness of the corequirement of Rac and acidic phospholipids for activation of the native complex . The activation of the WAVE2 complex as a function of the concentration of the complex was clearly sigmoidal with a Hill coefﬁcient of 4 . 4 , suggesting the highly cooperative assembly of a functional unit ( Figure 2H ) . Activation of the WAVE2 complex happens on the surface of PIP 3 liposomes containing prenylated Rac - GTP ( see below , Figure 4 , and Movie S1 ) . Thus , in addition to providing a chemical or electrostatic signal for activation , the membrane provides a constrained surface for the assembly of supramolecular signaling units in which cooperative interactions between multiple WAVE2 complexes could take place ( see the Discussion ) . It had been suggested that WAVE2 complex isolated from the plasma membrane is fully active due to the presence of IRSp53 ( Suetsugu et al . , 2006 ) . When we rapidly puriﬁed native WAVE2 complex from the membranes of EGF - stimulated A - 431 cells ( Figure S2D ) we found that , like the cytosolic complex , it was almost completely inactive despite containing IRSp53 and could also be activated with Rac and PIP 3 liposomes ( Figure S2E ) . In contrast , the same conditions have not worked to activate the native WAVE1 complex puriﬁed by conventional chromatog - raphy ( Figure S2F ) . This suggests that WAVE1 and WAVE2 complexes may be regulated differently , or that the longer conventional puriﬁcation of the WAVE1 complex may have failed to preserve important posttranslational modiﬁcations ( see below ) .

Phosphorylation Is Required for Activation of the WAVE2 Complex WAVE2 is known to be phosphorylated by MAP kinases in response to growth factor stimulation ( Danson et al . , 2007 ) , and it was for that reason that we initially puriﬁed the complex from EGF - stimulated cells ( Figure 2 ) . When we subsequently compared complexes from either EGF - stimulated or serum - starved cells , we found that both complexes were basally inac - tive and could be equally activated by PIP 3 liposomes and Rac ( Figure 3A ) . Yet the effects of EGF treatment could be detected by a decrease in the electrophoretic mobility of WAVE2 in com - plexes puriﬁed from EGF - treated cells ( Figure 3B ) . This shift was due to phosphorylation , since it could be reversed by treatment with lambda protein phosphatase or the serine / threonine phos - phatase PP2A ( Figure 3C ) . Therefore , EGF - induced phosphory - lation is not required for activation of the WAVE2 complex . However , WAVE2 is known to be phosphorylated by other kinases , including Abl ( Leng et al . , 2005 ; Stuart et al . , 2006 ) , so we asked whether the WAVE2 complex might be phosphory - lated independently of EGF . Mass spectrometric analysis of native WAVE2 complexes puriﬁed from either serum - starved or EGF - stimulated cells revealed a total of 12 phosphorylated sites present in both conditions ( Figure 3D and Table S2 ) : ﬁve sites in WAVE2 ( four serines and one either serine or threonine ; see legend to Figure 3 and Table S2 ) , ﬁve sites in Abi - 1 ( four serines and one either serine or threonine ) , and two serine sites in Abi - 2 ( both Abi - 1 and Abi - 2 were present in our immunopuriﬁed prep - arations , which presumably consist of a mixture of complexes containing one or the other subunit ) . In addition , there were two serine sites in WAVE2 and one serine site in Abi - 2 detected only in serum - starved cells , as well as one threonine site in WAVE2 and one serine site in Abi - 2 detected only in EGF - stimulated cells ( Figure 3D and Table S2 ) . Only 7 out of these 17 sites seem to have been reported previously and no speciﬁc function hasbeenattributed toanyof them . Phosphorylationwas not detected on Pir121 , Nap 1 , or HSPC300 for either sample . To test whether any of these EGF - independent sites are required for activity , we exposed the complex isolated from serum - starved cells to the phosphatase PP2A . To avoid carry - over of the phosphatase into the polymerization assays , we treated the complex while still bound to the immunoafﬁnity resin , then washed extensively and eluted . WAVE2 complex treated with control buffer was basally inactive and could be activated by the standard conditions , albeit with slower kinetics than our other immunopuriﬁed preparations , possibly due to the extended incubation at 30 (cid:2) C ( Figure 3E ) . Treatment with PP2A resulted in a marked dose - dependent decrease in the ability to activate the complex , entirely abolishing acti - vatability at the highest dose ( Figure 3E ) . This effect could be blocked by the PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid ( Figure 3E ) . Phosphatase treatment did not affect the intrinsic activity of the WAVE2 protein , as assayed by partial thermal denaturation ( Figure 3F ) , and had no effect on the WAVE2 complex in the absence of activators ( Figure 3G ) . We conclude that serine and / or threonine phosphorylation of native WAVE2 complex is required for activation by Rac and acidic phospho - lipids . Activation of the WAVE2 Complex Takes Place on the Membrane Surface without Dissociation of Constituent Subunits Activation of the WAVE2 complex and the resulting actin nucle - ation might be strictly localized to the membrane surface ; alter - natively , signals at the membrane could play a transient role in stimulating the WAVE2 complex followed by release of the acti - vated complex or dissociation of the WAVE subunit . When we examined activation of the WAVE2 complex microscopically , we found that ﬁlamentous actin structures radiate from the lipo - somes themselves ( Figure 4A and Movie S1 ) , suggesting that the activated complex promotes localized actin polymerization at the lipid membrane surface . Further , activation of the complex does not appear to be accompanied by dissociation of the constituent subunits , as originally proposed for the WAVE1 complex ( Eden et al . , 2002 ) . Stoichiometric amounts of Pir121 , Nap 1 , WAVE2 , and Abi - 1 cosedimented with PIP 3 liposomes and prenylated Rac1 - GTP under conditions leading to activation ( D ) Prenylated Rac2 - GTP , but not Cdc42 , can activate the WAVE2 complex in conjunction with PIP 3 liposomes .

( Figure 4B ) , suggesting that none of these subunits dissociated from the complex . Under these conditions , most of the preny - lated Rac1 - GTP is incorporated into the liposomes , but the Arp2 / 3 complex did not cosediment appreciably ( Figure 4B ) , suggesting that the interaction between the Arp2 / 3 complex and activated WAVE2 complex is weak . Because Sra - 1 / Pir121 can bind Rac - GTP ( Kobayashi et al . , 1998 ) and WAVE2 can bind PIP 3 ( Oikawa et al . , 2004 ) , it is conceivable that the complex could have dissociated on the membrane , leaving the subcomplexes independently bound to Rac and PIP 3 . To test for this possibility , we ﬁrst cosedimented the WAVE2 complex with PIP 3 liposomes and prenylated Rac1 - GTP under conditions leading to activation . We then solubilized the liposome pellet with detergent and immunoprecipitated the soluble material with antibody to WAVE2 . We found stoichio - metric amounts of Pir121 , WAVE2 , Abi - 1 , and HSPC300 in the WAVE2 immunoprecipitate ( Figure 4C ) , suggesting that the complex remained intact after activation . Some solubilized pre - nylated Rac1 - GTP coimmunoprecipitated with the complex ( Fig - ure 4C ) , presumably through its interaction with Sra - 1 / Pir121 , further indicating that the complex did not dissociate upon binding to activated Rac . Although we cannot discount the remote possibility that the complex dissociated upon activation and fully reassociated during the experiment , these results disfavor a model of activation through dissociation of the WAVE subunit ( Eden et al . , 2002 ) . Instead , activation must proceed through an allosteric change in the complex . The WAVE2 Complex Binds Rac - GTP or Acidic Phospholipids Independently , but Binding to Both Is Required for Activation Although Rac - GTP or PIP 3 liposomes were individually unable to activate the WAVE2 complex , previous work suggests that each on its own may bind to the complex ( Innocenti et al . , 2004 ; Oikawa et al . , 2004 ) ; this implies a distinction between recruit - ment and activation that could be of physiological relevance . To examine these features , we cosedimented the WAVE2 com - plex with liposomes that contained either uncharged or acidic phospholipids , and either prenylated Rac - GDP or GTP ( Table 1 ) . We omitted actin so as not to perturb cosedimentation . Lipo - somes containing PC and PE ( both lipids with no net charge ) together with prenylated Rac - GDP brought down a negligible amount of WAVE2 ( Table 1 ) . PC : PE liposomes together with pre - nylated Rac - GTP bound 56 % of total WAVE2 while PIP 3 lipo - somes in the absence of Rac bound 69 % , but neither activated the complex ( Table 1 ) . PIP 3 liposomes in combination with pre - nylated Rac - GTP cosedimented 91 % of the WAVE2 signal and activated the complex robustly ( Table 1 ) . Prenylated Rac was incorporated into the liposomes regardless of nucleotide state or liposome composition ( Figure S3A ) . Thus , although there is substantial binding of the WAVE2 complex to either Rac - GTP or acidic phospholipids individually , this binding is insufﬁcient for activation . Simultaneous binding to Rac - GTP and acidic phospholipids results both in more efﬁcient recruitment and activation . We asked whether phosphorylation of the WAVE2 complex might affect the interactions with acidic phospholipids and / or Rac . Treatment of the WAVE2 complex with PP2A did not affect the interaction between the WAVE2 complex and PC : PE lipo - somes containing prenylated Rac - GTP ( Table 1 ) . However , PP2A treatment diminished binding between the WAVE2 complex and PIP 3 liposomes by half ( Table 1 ) . When the phos - phatase - treated complex was cosedimented with both PIP 3 liposomes and prenylated Rac - GTP , binding was also reduced ( Table 1 ) . Hence , phosphorylation may regulate WAVE2 complex activation by modulating binding to acidic phospholipids . DISCUSSION The Physiological State of Isolated WAVE Complexes We have demonstrated that both native WAVE1 and WAVE2 complexes , obtained from three different sources ( pig leuko - cytes , bovine brain , and A - 431 cells ) , two subcellular fractions ( cytosol and membranes ) , two physiological states ( serum starved and EGF stimulated ) , and puriﬁed in two different ways ( conventional chromatography and immunopuriﬁcation ) are inactive . Previous reports of constitutive activity are most likely due to experimental artifacts , one of which we could reproduce under controlled conditions ( Kim et al . , 2006 ) ( Figure 1G ) .

Recent reports suggest that the choice and placement of tags , as well as the procedures used to purify the complex away from unfolded species , may help preserve their inactive state ( Deriv - ery et al . , 2009 ; Ismail et al . , 2009 ) . When we used native complexes , we were unable to repro - duce the previously reported activation by addition of Rac alone ( Eden et al . , 2002 ; Ismail et al . , 2009 ) . Differences in preparation conditions most likely explain the discrepancies . We suspect that in the initial report from our laboratory an unknown feature of the puriﬁcation or assay conditions may have destabilized the complex , rendering it susceptible to nonphysiological activa - tion . In retrospect , it is noteworthy that in those experiments activation was achieved with both GDP - and GTP - bound Rac1 , suggesting nonspeciﬁc effects .

Activation of the WAVE2 Complex by Coincident Signals An extensive body of research indicates that Rac and acidic phospholipids induce actin assembly during lamellipodial exten - sion , cell motility , and chemotaxis . It was also evident that WAVE plays an important role in these processes . However , until now , it was not clear how these signals affected WAVE or how they speciﬁcally contributed to the process of actin assembly . Our experiments demonstrating that an inactive WAVE2 complex can be activated fully by the combination of prenylated Rac - GTP and acidic phospholipids establish sufﬁciency in a reconsti - tuted system of puriﬁed components . This conclusion explains many cellular results that suggest that activated Rac on its own is not sufﬁcient to stimulate actin assembly . Expression of a WAVE2 construct harboring mutations in a domain that binds acidic phospholipids diminishes lamellipodia formation induced by constitutively active Rac ( Oikawa et al . , 2004 ) . Fluorescent activation indicator for Rho proteins ( FLAIR ) experiments show that migrating ﬁbroblasts exhibit a gradient of Rac activity corre - lated with the direction of movement , but this region of Rac acti - vation is much broader than the region where actin polymerizes ( Kraynov et al . , 2000 ) . Similarly , in migrating neutrophil - like HL - 60 cells , Rac activity spatially correlates with but is more diffuse than the domain of the WAVE2 complex ( Weiner et al . , 2007 ) . Actin polymerization that drives the extension of pseudo - pods during phagocytosis in leukocytes requires Rac1 , but recruitment of constitutively active Rac1 to the plasma mem - brane that lines an engulfed particle will not maintain actin poly - merization after the particle has been internalized ( Scott et al . , 2005 ) . Instead , the disappearance of F - actin from the phago - some parallels the disappearance of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . These observa - tions argue for a role of acidic phospholipids such as PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 as a critical input in vivo . Furthermore , production of acidic phos - pholipids and activation of Rac are often linked , as in the case of neutrophil chemotaxis . Intracellular signaling networks down - stream of chemoattractant receptors engage heterotrimeric G proteins and Ras , which are thought to activate PI3 kinases and PIP 3 production at the leading edge ( Charest and Firtel , 2007 ) . This in turn activates Rac through guanine nucleotide exchange factors . Through still poorly deﬁned positive feedback loops , Rac - mediated actin assembly further promotes PI3 kinase activity ( Charest and Firtel , 2006 ) , producing an area on the membrane enriched in PIP 3 and Rac . An interesting ﬁnding is that acidic phospholipids other than PIP 3 can support activation of the WAVE2 complex . The relative level of activation of the WAVE2 complex we observed with pre - nylated Rac - GTP and liposomes of varying phosphoinositide composition ( Figure 2E ) parallels the binding afﬁnity of recombi - nant WAVE2 protein for a similar series of phosphoinositides , reported previously by Oikawa and colleagues ( Oikawa et al . , 2004 ) . Our results suggest that in the absence of PIP 3 the WAVE2 complex might still promote actin assembly as long as Rac activation is colocalized with other acidic phospholipids . This is consistent with studies in which PIP 3 production was abrogated and yet cells were still able to chemotax , although in some cases at slower rates than wild - type cells ( Ferguson et al . , 2007 ; Hoeller and Kay , 2007 ) . Regulation of WAVE2 function by IRSp53 has also been sug - gested . IRSp53 has been shown to enhance the activity of iso - lated recombinant WAVE2 and of WAVE2 complexes ( Miki et al . , 2000 ; Suetsugu et al . , 2006 ) . However , the preparations of complex used in those experiments had high basal activity , so the effect of IRSp53 on an inactive complex remained to be determined . In our preparations of immunopuriﬁed WAVE2 com - plex , we detected IRSp53 ( Figure 2A , Figure S2D , and Table S1 ) , and yet these complexes were inactive ( Figure 2B and Fig - ure S2E ) . These results indicate that IRSp53 by itself did not acti - vate at the concentrations present in our preparations , but they do not discount a role for IRSp53 in mediating activation by Rac and acidic phospholipids . Regulation of WAVE2 Complex Activity by Phosphorylation Rac and acidic phospholipids are together incapable of acti - vating a WAVE2 complex that is not properly phosphorylated ( Figure 3E ) , rendering phosphorylation a prerequisite for activa - tion . Although phosphorylation of WAVE proteins had been reported , a precise regulatory mechanism had not been deﬁned . With the biochemical reconstitution of WAVE2 complex activa - tion , we could show that regulation by phosphorylation is direct Table 1 .

Percentages of total WAVE2 bound ( see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures for details ) are from experiments with Rac2 ; comparable results were obtained with Rac1 . The results of actin polymerization assays of equivalent composition are reported under ‘‘Activation . ’’ See also Figure S3 . Molecular Cell Coincident Signals Activate the WAVE Complex Molecular Cell 36 , 512 – 524 , November 13 , 2009 ª 2009 Elsevier Inc . 521 and acts at the core of the activation mechanism . Phosphatase treatment also diminished the interaction between the WAVE2 complex and acidic phospholipids ( Table 1 ) . This reduction might directly impinge on the efﬁciency of activation or simply reﬂect conformational changes important for activation . It will be important in the future to study the precise details of this regulation , but it is already clear that , unlike the previously described phosphorylation of the VCA domain of WAVE2 , which affects its catalytic activity on the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Nakanishi et al . , 2007 ; Pocha and Cory , 2009 ) , the effects we observed are at the level of the activation process itself . The Mechanism of WAVE2 Complex Activation Two mechanistic models have been suggested to explain the regulation of WAVE activity : recruitment of an already active complex to sites of actin assembly , and dissociation of the complex to release active WAVE protein ( Eden et al . , 2002 ; Inno - centi et al . , 2004 ) . Our results show that neither of these explanations is correct . Since activation of the WAVE2 complex is not induced by the mere recruitment of the complex to lipo - somes containing either Rac - GTP or acidic phospholipids alone ( Table 1 ) , and it is not mediated by dissociation of the complex subunits ( Figures 4B and 4C ) , activation must involve a confor - mational change that presumably exposes the VCA domain of WAVE2 . With the complex remaining intact , the catalytic activity of WAVE2 would remain strictly localized to sites on the plasma membrane deﬁned by the activators ( Figure 4A and Movie S1 ) , allowing precise spatial control of actin assembly and making it possible to attain high local density of activated WAVE2 Acidic phospholipids Phosphorylated active WAVE2 complex Phosphorylated inactive WAVE2 complex Dephosphorylatedinactive WAVE2 complex Actin polymerization PIP 3 Prenylated Rac - GTP Figure 5 . Model for WAVE2 Function Counterclockwise from top right , the WAVE2 complex is intrinsically inactiveand must bephos - phorylated before it can be activated . However , phosphorylation by itself does not activate the complex . Phosphorylated WAVE2 complex can bind acidic phospholipids , including PIP 3 , or pre - nylated Rac - GTP , but binding to either is not sufﬁ - cient for activation . Binding to both acidic phos - pholipids and prenylated Rac - GTP activates the WAVE2 complex , most likely though allosteric changes , leading to Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin poly - merization . Although PIP 3 is most potent , other acidic phospholipids can also activate the com - plex together with prenylated Rac - GTP .

This might be crucial for higher - order interactions implied by the cooperative nature of the activation process ( Figure 2H ) . We envision two scenarios that could take place independently or together to produce cooperative activation . Dimer - ization of WASP and WAVE proteins dramatically increases their afﬁnity for the Arp2 / 3 complex , substantially enhancing actin assembly ( Padrick et al . , 2008 ) . Activation of the WAVE2 complex is constrained to the surface of PIP 3 liposomes contain - ing Rac , and at sufﬁciently high WAVE2 complex concentration , the proximity of activated WAVE2 molecules could mimic the effect of dimerization , stimulating actin polymerization nonli - nearly . Alternatively , high concentration of WAVE2 complexes on the liposome surface could induce or stabilize conformations that enhance activity . Regardless of the mechanisms giving rise to it , the observed highly cooperative activation would effectively set a threshold for actin polymerization . Below a certain concen - tration of complex on the plasma membrane , actin polymeriza - tion would be negligible , especially in the presence of abundant actin - depolymerizing activities , and this may serve to reduce noise in the system . Once the proper combination of activators leads to the recruitment of sufﬁcient WAVE2 complex to surpass that threshold concentration , higher - order interactions might come into play and promote the high levels of actin polymeriza - tion necessary for membrane protrusion . A Model for Activation of the WAVE Complex In Figure 5 we summarize the main features of WAVE2 complex regulation . We envision several states of the WAVE2 complex ( counterclockwise from top right ) : in the cytoplasm either dephosphorylated or primed for activation by phosphorylation ; on the plasma membrane independently bound to acidic phos - pholipids , includingbutnotlimitedtoPIP 3 , orboundtoprenylated Rac - GTP . None of these conditions is sufﬁcient for activation . Simultaneous binding of the properly phosphorylated complex to both Rac - GTP and acidic phospholipids results in activation , Molecular Cell Coincident Signals Activate the WAVE Complex 522 Molecular Cell 36 , 512 – 524 , November 13 , 2009 ª 2009 Elsevier Inc . most likely through conformational changes in the complex ( depicted by a switch from square to round subunits ) leading to Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin polymerization . A high local concentra - tion of activators would lead to the recruitment and activation of multiple WAVE2 complexes in close proximity , resulting in syner - gistic actin polymerization through cooperative mechanisms . This mode of regulation endows the system with special features appropriate for its cellular functions . Unlike other sys - tems in which individual signals make incremental contributions to activity , the multiple signals regulating WAVE2 function need to act simultaneously to result in any activation , making this a highly speciﬁc coincidence detector . This is important because thesignalsthatcontrolWAVEfunction , includingacidicphospho - lipids and activated Rac , are present throughout the cell and also function in other pathways . However , these signals should only activate the WAVE2 complex where they coincide , generating a very local area of actin polymerization even if their other cellular functions were not so strictly localized . Domains of activity could be sharpened by the highly cooperative nature of activation , which might set a threshold below which activation would be negligible and above which activation would be explosive , espe - cially in the presence of positive feedback loops enhancing the local production of activators . Conversely , the coordinated and cooperative nature of WAVE2 complex regulation would allow for very rapid inactivation by simply lowering the amount of any one of the activators on the membrane , generating true switch - like behavior . Kinases and phosphatases would further tune activity if acting locally , or shut it down entirely throughout the cell if acting globally . This system , with its capacity for explosive activation and rapid inactivation as well as exquisite spatial reso - lution , is ideally suited for regulating actin dynamics during cell motility and especially chemotaxis , where constant changes in the direction of movement require quick responses , tight locali - zation of protrusions , and the need to effectively discern signal from noise . In retrospect , the great effort required to reconstitute actin polymerization mediated by the WAVE complex was due to the lability of the complex and most especially to the combinatorial nature of inputs that operate in a narrow range of effective concentrations . Yet achieving full reconstitution was crucial , since it resolved at once the regulatory question of whether a constitutively active WAVE complex is recruited to sites of actin assemblyorwhetherseveralinputsarenecessarytoallosterically activateaninactive complex . Thequantitativecharacterization of thissystemyieldedunexpectedinsights , suchasthecooperative nature of activation , the requirement for EGF - independent phos - phorylation , and the lipid speciﬁcity . These results already explain many in vivo ﬁndings and should help us construct more realistic and detailed models for the signaling processes that coordinate actin assembly in cell motility and chemotaxis . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Actin Polymerization Assays Actin polymerization assays were as described previously ( Ho et al . , 2006 ) . All reagents were kept on ice except for ddH 2 O , which was kept at room temper - ature . Reactions ( 60 m l ) were set up at room temperature , adding reagents in the following order : ddH 2 O , 10 3 assay buffer ( 200 mM HEPES [ pH 7 . 7 at 24 (cid:2) C ] , 1 M KCl , 10 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EDTA , 10 mM DTT ; 10 3 buffer was diluted to 1 3 ﬁnal concentration , subtracting the volume of other reagents already in buffers of comparable composition ) , ATP ( 0 . 2 mM ﬁnal concentra - tion ) , Arp2 / 3 complex , WAVE complex or recombinant WAVE protein , lipo - somes , and GTPases . Actin / pyrene - actin ( premixed in an 80 % to 20 % molar ratio unless indicated otherwise ) was added last to start the assay , the reac - tions were immediately transferred to quartz cuvettes , and pyrene ﬂuores - cence was measured at 407 nm with excitation at 365 nm at 24 (cid:2) C in a ﬂuores - cence spectrophotometer ( Varian Cary Eclipse ) . Between every assay , cuvettes were cleaned with a solution of two parts concentrated hydrochloric acid and one part concentrated nitric acid , rinsed thoroughly with water fol - lowedby ethanol , anddried withanairstream . Rinsingthecuvetteswithwater andethanolalonebuiltaresidue , perhapsofdenaturedWAVE , thatcouldstim - ulate the Arp2 / 3 complex . We also found it necessary to keep the total protein concentration in the reaction above 0 . 25 mg / ml for optimal activation of WAVE2 complex ; this sometimes required adding WP1x3 peptide ( see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures ) to 0 . 25 mg / ml .
