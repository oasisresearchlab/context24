A General Equation for Fitting Contact Area and Friction vs Load Measurements Robert W . Carpick , 1 D . Frank Ogletree , and Miquel Salmeron Materials Sciences Division , Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory , Berkeley , California 94720 Received August 31 , 1998 , accepted November 30 , 1998 The variation of contact area with load between adhesive elastic spheres depends upon the effective range of attractive surface forces . Relatively simple forms to describe limiting cases exist , but the gen - eral intermediate case requires a more complex analysis . Maugis , using a Dugdale model [ D . Maugis , J . Colloid . Interf . Sci . 150 , 243 ( 1992 ) ] , provides an analytic solution , but the resulting equations are cumbersome if one wishes to compare with experimental data such as atomic force microscope measurements .

INTRODUCTION An understanding of contact , adhesion , and friction between surfaces requires knowledge of the area of contact between them . Continuum models which predict the contact area for various geometries have been worked out starting with the pioneering work of Hertz ( 1 ) . Experimental techniques that measure contact area for elastic single asperities , namely the surface forces appa - ratus ( SFA ) ( 2 , 3 ) and the atomic force microscope ( AFM ) ( 4 ) , can be described by the geometry of contacting spheres ( approx - imated as paraboloids ) . In the case of the AFM , one sphere represents the sample , with an inﬁnite radius of curvature , while the other sphere represents the tip , which in many cases conforms to a paraboloidal shape ( 5 ) . In the absence of adhesion , the Hertz model has been shown to accurately describe the contact area between elastic spheres ( 6 ) . However , at small scales the surface - to - bulk ratio becomes signiﬁcant . Therefore , adhesion arising from attractive surface forces is generally not negligible and must be included in any description of contact area . The spatial range over which surface forces act depends upon the chemistry of the materials in contact , and may or may not be long range compared to the scale of elastic deformations due to these forces ( 7 ) ( Fig . 1 ) . Two limiting cases are appar - ent . When the surface forces are short range in comparison to the elastic deformations they cause ( i . e . compliant materials , strong adhesion forces , large tip radii ) , the contact area is described by the Johnson – Kendall – Roberts ( JKR ) model ( 8 ) . The opposite limit ( i . e . , stiff materials , weak adhesion forces , small tip radii ) is referred to as the Derjaguin – Mu¨ller – Toporov ( DMT ) regime ( 9 ) and the form of the contact area is presented in the work of Maugis 2 ( 10 ) . It is convenient to utilize a nondimensional physical parameter to quantify these limits and cases in between . Often referred to as Tabor’s parameter m , this transition parameter is deﬁned as ( 11 ) m5 S 16 R g 2 9 K 2 z 03 D 1 / 3 , [ 1 ] where z 0 is the equilibrium separation of the surfaces , R is the tip curvature radius , g is the interfacial energy per unit area ( work of adhesion ) , and K is the combined elastic modulus of tip and sample , given by K 5 4 / 3 z ( ( 1 2 n 12 ) / E 1 1 ( 1 2 n 22 ) / E 2 ) 2 1 where E 1 and E 2 are the tip and sample Young’s moduli , respectively , and n 1 and n 2 are the tip and sample Poisson ratios , respectively . The quantity m is in fact equal to the ratio of the elastic deformation just before the surfaces separate to the equilibrium separation z 0 . To approximate an actual interaction potential like that de - picted in Fig . 1 , Maugis ( 10 ) considers a “Dugdale” ( square well ) potential to describe attractive forces between contacting spheres ( Fig . 2 ) , where a constant adhesive stress s 0 acts over a range d t . Thus , the work of adhesion is g 5 s 0 z d t . Maugis deﬁnes a parameter , l , which is similar to m , given by l5 2 s 0 S R pg K 2 D 1 / 3 . [ 2 ] By choosing s 0 to match the minimum adhesive stress of a Lennard – Jones potential ( with equilibrium separation z 0 ) , it follows that d t 5 0 . 97 z 0 , and so l 5 1 . 1570 m . Thus , l and m are roughly equivalent . For convenience we shall refer to l in this paper as the “transition parameter . ” If l . 5 , the JKR 1 Present address : Mailstop 1413 , Sandia National Laboratories , Albuquer - que , NM 87185 - 1413 . 2 As discussed by Greenwood ( 10 ) , it is more appropriate to refer to the DMT regime as the “Bradley limit , ” which is a model for completely rigid spheres . Here we refer to “DMT” in a conventional sense , as with Maugis ( 9 ) .

Values between 0 . 1 and 5 correspond to the “transition regime” be - tween JKR and DMT . A summary of different conventions used for deﬁning this “transition parameter” is provided by Greenwood ( 11 ) . The Hertz model applies when there are no attractive surface forces ( g 5 0 ) . 2 . DEPENDENCE OF CONTACT AREA UPON LOAD FOR THE JKR AND DMT REGIMES The variation of contact area with load for various values of l , and for the Hertz model , is plotted in Fig . 3 . In the non - zero adhesion cases , there is a well - deﬁned “pull - off force” or negative “critical load” at which the surfaces separate when being pulled apart . This applies for the case of “ﬁxed loads” where one of the spheres is attached to a compliant spring ( as in the case of an AFM cantilever ) . We shall refer to this negative critical load as L c , and for the two limiting cases it is given by L c ( JKR ) 5 2 3 2 pg R [ 3a ] L c ( DMT ) 5 2 2 pg R . [ 3b ] The models also predict particular values for the contact radius at zero load a 0 , given by a 0 ( JKR ) 5 S 6 pg R 2 K D 1 / 3 [ 4a ] a 0 ( DMT ) 5 S 2 pg R 2 K D 1 / 3 . [ 4b ] The variation of contact radius a with load L for the JKR and DMT cases are each described by relatively simple equa - tions : a a 0 ( JKR ) 5 S 1 1 ˛ 1 2 L / L c ( JKR ) 2 D 2 / 3 [ 5a ] a a 0 ( DMT ) 5 ~ 1 2 L / L c ( DMT ) ! 1 / 3 . [ 5b ] Since the tip is axially symmetric , the contact area A is simply given by A 5 p a 2 . [ 6 ] It is apparent that Eqs . [ 5a ] and [ 5b ] can be generalized to form an equation which describes the contact radius for both cases , a a 0 ~ a ! 5 S a1 ˛ 1 2 L / L c ( a ) 1 1 a D 2 / 3 , [ 7 ] FIG . 1 . Interaction forces ( per unit area ) for the Hertz , JKR , and DMT models , compared to a realistic interaction . There is no attractive force in the Hertz model , only hard wall repulsion at contact . The JKR model includes short range adhesion which is essentially a delta function with strength g and thus acts only within the contact zone . The DMT curve shown represents a long - range surface force . A volume integrated force , like the van der Waal’s force , can also lead to a DMT dependence , where the contact proﬁle remains Hertzian and the attractive forces act like an additional external load . For an actual interaction force , the integral of the force – distance attractive well corresponds to the work of adhesion , g . FIG . 2 . The force – distance relation for the Dugdale model used by Maugis . A constant adhesive stress ( force per unit area ) s 0 acts between the surfaces over a range d t . At greater separations , the attractive force is zero . The work of adhesion is thus g 5 s 0 d t . FIG . 3 . The Hertz area – load curve , and the JKR – DMT transition , plotted in Maugis’ units ( Eq . [ 9 ] ) . Area – load curves for the JKR limit , the DMT limit , and an intermediate case are shown . These approach the Hertz curve in the limit g 3 0 ( no adhesion ) . Adhesion increases the contact area from the Hertz case for a given load by an amount dependent upon the range of attractive forces . 396 CARPICK , OGLETREE , AND SALMERON where a 5 1 corresponds exactly to the JKR case , and a 5 0 corresponds exactly to the DMT case . Included in Eq . [ 7 ] is the fact that L c and a 0 depend on a as well . We shall refer to Eq . [ 7 ] as the generalized transition equation . We now show that for intermediate cases ( 0 , a , 1 ) , the generalized transition equation corresponds very closely to solutions for the transition regime ( 0 . 1 , l , 5 ) elegantly worked out by Maugis using the Dugdale model ( 10 ) . 3 . DEPENDENCE OF CONTACT AREA UPON LOAD FOR THE MAUGIS – DUGDALE MODEL Utilizing the Dugdale model is a reasonable method for esti - mating the value of the contact radius ( and other quantities ) as a function of load . The solution is referred to as the “MD” solution ( Maugis – Dugdale ) . Two equations are needed to relate a and L , l aˆ 2 2 F ˛ m 2 2 1 1 ~ m 2 2 2 ! cos 2 1 S 1 m D G 1 4 l 2 aˆ 3 F ˛ m 2 2 1 cos 2 1 S 1 m D 2 m 1 1 G 5 1 [ 8a ] Lˆ 5 aˆ 3 2 l aˆ 2 F ˛ m 2 2 1 1 m 2 cos 2 1 S 1 m DG , [ 8b ] where Lˆ and aˆ are simple parameterizations of L and a , Lˆ 5 L pg R [ 9a ] aˆ 5 a z S K pg R 2 D 1 / 3 , [ 9b ] and the parameter m represents the ratio between the contact radius a and an outer radius c at which the gap between the surfaces reaches d t ( i . e . , where the adhesive stress no longer acts ) . Maugis’ equations properly predict the JKR and DMT limits . The difﬁculty in utilizing the MD equations lies in the lack of a single expression relating only a and L . To plot the MD solution or ﬁt it to data , one needs to simultaneously solve Eqs . [ 8a ] and [ 8b ] by letting m vary appropriately between limits which depend upon l . Furthermore , the relation for the pull - off force must be determined through iteration ( 12 ) if the value of l is not known a priori ( the usual case with experimental measurements ) . In practice , this is rather cumbersome if not impossible to carry out with common software programs that utilize automated statistical ﬁtting procedures . 4 . COMPARISON OF THE MD SOLUTION AND THE GENERALIZED TRANSITION EQUATION In Fig . 4 , we plot the MD solution for four different values of l . The generalized transition equation is overlaid , where the value of a in each case was optimized to provide the best ﬁt . Each pair of plots share identical values of a 0 and L c , respec - tively . For all values of l , the difference between the general - ized transition equation and the MD solution is less than 1 % ( and less than 0 . 1 % in most cases ) for the relevant load regime . Furthermore , the generalized transition equation is exact for the JKR and DMT limits . Therefore , the generalized transition equation is an excellent approximation to the MD solution . The optimization of a was performed by minimizing the integrated square deviation between the MD solution and the generalized transition equation for the load range 2 u L c ( a ) u to 1 2 u L c ( a ) u . This load range was chosen because it is typical of the range employed in AFM measurements ( 4 ) , where loads are kept low to avoid wear . The low load regime also exhibits the most substantial curvature of the a vs L relationship in general , thus making ﬁtting more reliable . FIG . 4 . The MD solution ( heavy black lines ) and the generalized transition equation , Eq . [ 7 ] ( thin white lines ) , compared for four different values of l . The generalized transition equation is plotted for values of aˆ above the critical load , while the MD solution includes the unstable lower branch of solutions .

An empirical formula was ﬁt to this table of values to provide a conversion equation from a to l ( Fig . 5 ) , which is given by l5 2 0 . 924 z ln ~ 1 2 1 . 02 a ! . [ 10 ] For a . 1 . 02 2 1 5 0 . 980 , one can simply assume the JKR limit ( a 5 1 ) . The steep slope as a approaches the JKR limit means a larger uncertainty in determining l from a value of a in this range . Essentially this applies for values of a greater than ; 0 . 95 or equivalently for values of l greater than ; 3 . This is not problematic since the change in the contact radius as l ranges from 3 and up is reasonably small , apparent from Fig . 5a of Maugis ( 10 ) . In other words , a substantial uncertainty in l in this range does not lead to a correspondingly substantial uncertainty in the contact radius . The generalized transition equation is therefore reliable for all values of l , and Eq . [ 10 ] provides a reasonable and simple conversion from a to l . Importantly , the generalized transition equation does not intro - duce any additional free parameters compared to the MD solution . L c and a 0 can be represented in Maugis’ nondimensional units given in Eqs . [ 9a ] and [ 9b ] as follows : Lˆ c ~ l ! 5 L c pg R [ 11a ] aˆ 0 ~ l ! 5 a 0 z S K pg R 2 D 1 / 3 . [ 11b ] These nondimensional values are uniquely determined by the value of l and are listed in Table 1 and plotted vs l in Figs . 6 and 7 , respectively . We have determined empirical equations that ﬁt these values reasonably well ( within ; 1 % accuracy or better ) , which are also plotted in Figs . 6 and 7 , respectively : Lˆ c ~ l ! 5 2 7 4 1 1 4 z S 4 . 04 z l 1 . 4 2 1 4 . 04 z l 1 . 4 1 1 D [ 12a ] aˆ 0 ~ l ! 5 1 . 54 1 0 . 279 z S 2 . 28 z l 1 . 3 2 1 2 . 28 z l 1 . 3 1 1 D . [ 12b ] Eqs . [ 12a ] and [ 12b ] provide fast and simple ways of estimat - ing Lˆ c ( l ) and aˆ 0 ( l ) . These quantities can instead be deter - mined exactly from the MD equations using numerical meth - ods if preferred . 5 . FITTING PROCEDURE The above discussion leads to the following procedure for curve ﬁtting : ( 1 ) Obtain a measurement of contact radius a or friction F f as a function of load . For friction measurements , one must FIG . 5 . Plot of l vs a from Table I ( ﬁlled circles ) and the empirical conversion equation , Eq . [ 10 ] ( solid line ) , ﬁt to the data . FIG . 6 . Plot of Lˆ c ( l ) vs l determined from the MD solution ( ﬁlled circles ) , and an empirical ﬁt , Eq . [ 12a ] ( solid line ) . The values of Lˆ c ( l ) for the JKR and DMT limits are indicated by the dotted lines . FIG . 7 . Plot of aˆ 0 ( l ) vs l determined from the MD solution ( solid circles ) and an empirical ﬁt , Eq . [ 12b ] ( solid line ) . The values of aˆ 0 ( l ) for the JKR and DMT limits are indicated by the dotted lines . 398 CARPICK , OGLETREE , AND SALMERON assume that friction is directly proportional to the contact area ( F f 5 t z p a 2 , where t is the constant interfacial shear strength ) ( 4 , 5 ) . This is not expected to be true for multiple asperity contacts , or in the presence of wear ( see Section 6 ) . In the case of friction measurements , replace all occurrences of a with = F f in the relevant equations and discussion below . ( 2 ) Use a curve ﬁt optimization routine such as those avail - able in commercial software programs to ﬁt the generalized transition equation , Eq . [ 7 ] , to the data , letting a 0 , L c , and a be free parameters whose values will then be extracted from the ﬁt . Alternately , measure L c independently from force – distance curves ( 4 ) and constrain L c to this value for the ﬁt . Be aware that occasionally the last data point before separation in a sliding friction measurement where the load is being decreased may not correspond to L c if the tip and sample have prema - turely separated . ( 3 ) Use the above conversion equation , Eq . [ 10 ] , or the values in Table 1 , to determine l from the value of a extracted from ﬁtting the generalized transition equation . ( 4 ) The interfacial energy , g , can now be determined . Use Eq . [ 12a ] to solve for Lˆ c ( l ) now that l is known . Plug this value into Eq . [ 11a ] along with the value of L c extracted from the generalized transition equation ﬁt to solve for g ( this can be done only if the tip radius R is known ) . This can also be done numerically using the MD equations . ( 5 ) If measuring contact radius , the elastic modulus of the contact K can be determined . Use Eq . [ 12b ] to determine the value of aˆ 0 ( l ) . Plug this value and the value of a 0 extracted from the generalized transition equation ﬁt into Eq . [ 11b ] to determine K . This requires knowing R and using the value of g determined above . This can also be done numerically using the MD equations . ( 6 ) If measuring friction instead of contact radius , deter - mine t by using t 5 F 0 / p a 02 , where F 0 is extracted from the generalized transition equation ﬁt , and a 0 is determined by combining Eqs . [ 12b ] and [ 11b ] . This requires knowing values for R and K . 6 . DISCUSSION One must be careful in utilizing the generalized transition equation for the case of friction measurements since it assumes direct proportionality between friction and contact area . In general , SFA , AFM or other measurements where this model can be applied require elastic , single - asperity contacts . This is readily determined in the case of SFA , where the smooth mica sheets ensure a single contact , and optical measurements can reveal if wear is occurring ( 13 ) . More care is required with AFM measurements . Tip shapes must be characterized to ver - ify that they consist of a single , well - deﬁned paraboloidal protrusion ( 4 , 5 ) . Loads must be kept low to avoid wear , especially since atomic - scale wear may not be readily visible with standard AFM imaging capabilities ( 4 ) . The study of nanometer - scale single asperity contacts is still relatively new , and it is not certain that friction and contact area will always be directly proportional even in the elastic single asperity regime . For example , there could be a signiﬁ - cant pressure dependence of the shear strength t , or a signiﬁ - cant change in the contact area due to the presence of lateral forces , as opposed to purely normal forces . The latter issue has been discussed in further detail by Johnson ( 14 ) . Facile com - parison of friction data with the generalized transition equation could help to elucidate deviations due to these effects . In general , experiments where both contact area and friction are measured are ideal for such purposes ( 12 , 15 , 16 ) . Although the generalized transition equation is an excel - lent approximation for the MD solution , it is important to consider that the MD solution is exact for an idealized model potential . A more physically realistic potential is the Lennard – Jones potential , but this can be solved only numer - ically . Greenwood has performed this calculation for con - tacting spheres ( 11 ) . At this point the limits of continuum solutions become apparent . It is not clear exactly where to deﬁne the edge of the contact zone , i . e . , the contact radius . For real materials , the contact zone edge corresponds to the point where interfacial bonds are no longer formed . In a continuum model , one can deﬁne it to be where the gap between the continuum surfaces ﬁrst displays an inﬁnitesi - mal increase , or possibly somewhere further out from the center of the contact zone . For parameters in a typical AFM contact , one may need to span radially outward a few nanometers to ﬁnd a change in the gap of only 1 Å ( i . e . , less than an atomic bond length ) . Continuum mechanics cannot address such a question in an exact fashion when the ato - mistic nature of the materials must dominate . Therefore , it is possible that the MD solution for the contact radius is not an accurate prediction for real materials at nanometer length scales . Johnson , for example , has proposed an alternative based on the MD model ( 12 , 14 ) which closely resembles Greenwood’s result . The only way to test all of this is to compare experimental measurements with the MD model , Johnson’s , and others . The generalized transition equation facilitates this . A simple analytic equation for Johnson’s or Greenwood’s models analogous to the generalized transition equation would be useful . In summary , we have provided a simple analytic equation which can be used to ﬁt the contact radius ( or friction ) as a function of load to scanning probe measurements and others . The difference between this generalized transition equation and the MD solution is insigniﬁcant . A table of values and an empirical equation to determine the transition parameter l from the generalized transition equation parameter a is pro - vided . This approach requires a parabolic tip , a ﬂat sample , and wearless elastic interactions . Application of the generalized transition equation to friction or contact radius data can help identify the accuracy of particular continuum models to de - scribe the contact radius for nanometer scale contacts and others . 399 GENERAL CONTACT AREA EQUATION ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This work was supported by the Director , Ofﬁce of Energy Research , Ofﬁce of Basic Energy Sciences , Materials Sciences Division , of the U .
